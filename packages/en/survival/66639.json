When reports of unidentified flying\r\nobjects began to increase in the years between 1947 and 1952, one of\r\nus (D.H.M.) collected and studied the limited information available\r\nabout the sightings. He soon concluded (with a slight feeling of\r\ndisappointment!) that the flying saucers were not vehicles from other\r\nworlds but were only mundane objects and events of various kinds,\r\nsome of them commonplace, some familiar chiefly to meteorologists,\r\nphysicists, and astronomers.\r\n\r\nAt a conference with Air Force officials in Washington in April 1952,\r\nhe presented his idea that planetary mirages, sundogs, reflections,\r\nand other astronomical, atmospheric, and optical phenomena probably\r\naccounted for a large percentage of the mysterious UFOs. This\r\nsuggestion met with strong skepticism from some of the conferees who at\r\nthat time were sympathetic to the interplanetary hypothesis and were,\r\nof course, better acquainted with military than with physical science.\r\nOther conferees, however, wished to consider and test the theories\r\noffered. Proof obviously required a knowledge of all the facts of a\r\ngiven sighting, facts that often were not available to the public. The\r\nAir Force therefore granted access to the file of UFO cases. At the\r\nsame time, since many of the cases were then classified as secret,\r\nthe Air Force imposed the condition that security regulations must be\r\nstrictly observed.\r\n\r\nD.H.M. was then preparing a book to present his explanations of flying\r\nsaucers. Acceptance of the Air Force offer, with the accompanying\r\nrestriction, would have prevented his publishing analyses based on\r\nmaterial in the files. It would also have hindered any future public\r\ndiscussion of the UFO problem. For these reasons he felt compelled to\r\ndecline the opportunity.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1959 as we began planning the present book, we again\r\nrequested permission to study the Air Force records of UFO sightings.\r\nThis time the officials generously opened their files to us without\r\nrestriction. Thus we have been able to include detailed studies of\r\nparticular incidents, to give the explanations found for most of them\r\nby Air Force investigators, to explain the causes of some hitherto\r\nunsolved cases, and to suggest highly probable solutions for several\r\nclassic “Unknowns.”\r\n\r\nTo discuss each one of the thousands of unidentified flying objects\r\nreported during the last fifteen years is obviously impossible. We\r\nhave therefore chosen to describe the common types of sighting and to\r\nanalyze some of the representative and most interesting cases in each\r\ncategory. In general we have avoided using the names of the persons\r\ninvolved; but when the names are well known to the flying-saucer public\r\nand have previously appeared in print, we have felt no obligation to\r\ndisguise them.\r\n\r\nMany persons have contributed to the material in this book. Members of\r\nthe United States Air Force have generously helped us to collect the\r\nbasic facts, and have shown amazing patience in answering hundreds of\r\nsmall questions of detail. In particular, we wish to thank Col. Philip\r\nG. Evans, Col. Edward H. Wynn, Lt. Col. William T. Coleman, Lt. Col.\r\nRobert J. Friend, Lt. Col. Lawrence J. Tacker, Major Carl R. Hart, and\r\nSgt. David Moody.\r\n\r\nOthers who have helped us in various ways include Dr. Isaac Asimov,\r\nMr. Carleton Atherton, Miss C. M. Botley, Mr. Wilfred J. Chambers, Mr.\r\nAlbert M. Chop, Dr. Leon Davidson, Mr. Charles W. Dean, Mr. John F.\r\nGifford, Mr. Richard Hall, Mr. Theodore Hieatt, Prof. Seymour B. Hess,\r\nProf. J. Allen Hynek, Dr. Luigi G. Jacchia, Mr. Craig L.

Although most of the things seen have later been explained as\r\nunusual but normal phenomena, some enthusiasts continue to regard them\r\nas mysterious, and thus help perpetuate the myth that the “saucers” are\r\nactually spaceships from other planets, busily carrying out a patrol of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThis saucer myth owes an unacknowledged debt to Charles Fort, a\r\ntalented reporter, writer, and self-appointed gadfly of science. With\r\na strong curiosity about the world of nature but without training\r\nin the disciplines of research, Fort liked to challenge scientists\r\nin general and astronomers in particular with tales of “impossible”\r\nhappenings culled from books of folklore, old journals, and newspapers.\r\nHe mistrusted orthodox knowledge because, he believed, it smugly damned\r\nto oblivion all reports of marvels that it could not explain: pyrogenic\r\npersons; rains of fish, frogs, and stones; accounts of telepathy,\r\nteleportation, the vanishing of human beings, luminous objects in the\r\nsky. Although he never claimed that he believed the stories himself,\r\nFort enjoyed collecting them and before his death in 1932 had completed\r\nfour volumes of these anecdotes.\r\n\r\nScience-fiction writers have found an inexhaustible mine of ideas in\r\n_The Book of the Damned, New Lands, Lo!_, and _Wild Talents_, which\r\nalso provide the chief elements of the saucer myth:\r\n\r\n“Unknown, luminous things, or beings, have often been seen, sometimes\r\nclose to this earth, and sometimes high in the sky. It may be\r\nthat some of them were living things that occasionally come from\r\nsomewhere else in our existence, but that others were lights on the\r\nvessels of explorers, or voyagers, from somewhere else.”[I-1] These\r\nextraterrestrials may have been in communication with earthmen for many\r\nyears, Fort suggested, and they may sometimes kidnap and carry away\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_UFO Reports and the Air Force_\r\n\r\nMost flying-saucer reports have come from reliable citizens who have\r\nseen something extraordinary, something they do not understand.\r\nGenuinely puzzled, they often report the incident to the nearest Air\r\nForce base. The evaluation of such cases is the responsibility of the\r\nUnited States Air Force. Since the beginning of the saucer scare in\r\n1947, the chief investigating agency has been that at Wright-Patterson\r\nAir Force Base, Dayton, Ohio, and has borne a succession of\r\nnames--Project Sign, Project Grudge, Project Blue Book, and the Aerial\r\nPhenomena Group of the Aerospace Technical Intelligence Center,\r\nusually known as ATIC. Until recently this group operated under the\r\njurisdiction of the Assistant Chief of Staff, Intelligence. On July 1,\r\n1961, it was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Air Force Systems\r\nCommand. To simplify discussion in this book, however, the group that\r\ninvestigates unidentified aerial phenomena is generally referred to as\r\nATIC.\r\n\r\nIn military parlance the phrase “unidentified flying object,”\r\nabbreviated as UFO, is used to indicate any air-borne phenomenon that\r\nfails to identify itself to, or to be identified by, trained witnesses\r\non the ground or in the air who are using visual or radar methods of\r\nobservation. Created in the early days of the saucer era, the term UFO\r\nis unfortunately misleading because it seems to imply that the unknown\r\nis a solid material object. Many of them are not. The more dramatic\r\nphrase “flying saucer” is similarly misleading because not all the\r\nunknowns are shaped like a saucer, and not all of them are flying.\r\nSince no one has been able to devise a more accurate brief term that\r\nwill apply to all reports in this category, both “UFO” and “flying\r\nsaucer” have remained in common use.\r\n\r\nAir Force investigators and scientists have been able to account\r\nfor almost every reported “spaceship” as the result of failure to\r\nidentify some natural phenomenon. Some were the product of delusion\r\nor deliberate hoaxes. A few remain technically “Unknown” because,\r\nalthough the probable explanation is obvious, too few facts are\r\navailable to permit a positive identification. No such report suggests\r\nthe possibility that interplanetary craft are cruising in our skies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Scientist’s View_\r\n\r\nIf a spaceship from another planet should ever visit the earth, no one\r\nwould be more eager to acknowledge it than our government officials\r\nand our scientists. All governments would feel their responsibility\r\nto protect the human race if necessary, and to establish diplomatic\r\nrelations with the alien race if possible. The scientists would want to\r\nstudy, analyze, and try to understand the nature of both the ship and\r\nits occupants.\r\n\r\nMany persons, sincerely believing that flying saucers do exist, berate\r\nthe investigator who denies their reality and characterize him as\r\nstupid, willfully obtuse, or intellectually dishonest because he does\r\nnot accept the saucer reports at face value but weighs them by the same\r\nmethods most of us use in weighing evidence in everyday life. When told\r\nthere’s a horse in the bathtub, for example, the sensible man realizes\r\nthat the alleged visitation, while not impossible, is extremely\r\nimprobable. Therefore he does not immediately begin speculating on the\r\ncolor of the horse, where it might have come from, what its purpose\r\nmay be, and whether it will wreck the bathroom. Instead he adopts the\r\nscientific method and first goes to find out whether the horse is\r\nreally there.\r\n\r\nLike Fort, some flying-saucer believers are consciously or\r\nunconsciously antagonistic to the scientific method and resent its\r\nrestrictions as a child objects to discipline. Suggesting that a\r\nstrictly logical approach deprives us of valuable truths about the\r\nnature of the universe, and bluntly asserting that present-day\r\nphysicists and astronomers have closed their minds to the possibility\r\nof new knowledge, these enthusiasts imply that we should require less\r\nrigorous proof for the reality of saucers than for other types of\r\nphysical phenomena.\r\n\r\nBecause so many amateur investigators have misunderstood,\r\nmisrepresented, and condemned the scientists’ attitude, the authors of\r\nthis book (asking the indulgence of their colleagues) will briefly\r\noutline the principles a researcher ordinarily applies to the study of\r\nany new problem--the nature of radioactivity, the cause of a disease,\r\nor the origin of flying saucers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Question of “Evidence”_\r\n\r\nMost physicists, chemists, biologists, and astronomers will agree\r\nthat life in some form probably exists in other parts of the galaxy.\r\nThese other life forms, if they exist, may or may not have a kind of\r\nintelligence similar to our own; if they have, we might or might not\r\nbe able to recognize it. Such speculations, while fascinating, lie\r\nentirely in the realm of theory. They are not facts and do not provide\r\nthe slightest support to the often stated corollary that intelligent\r\ncreatures do live on other planets and frequently visit the earth.\r\n\r\nIn approaching the spacecraft hypothesis, the scientist asks first:\r\nWhat facts are we trying to account for? And second: Does the\r\nspacecraft theory account for these facts better than the normal\r\nexplanations that are already available? After studying hundreds of UFO\r\nreports, however, he concludes that much of the startling “proof” that\r\nsaucers are spacecraft is merely inference. Of the established facts,\r\nnone requires a new theory to account for it; and no evidence exists\r\nthat even faintly suggests, to the expert, that interplanetary visitors\r\nare involved.\r\n\r\nIn the study of UFO phenomena this question of “evidence” is crucial.\r\nThe careful investigator tries always to distinguish sharply between an\r\nobserved fact, which is evidence, and an interpretation of that fact,\r\nwhich is not evidence no matter how reasonable it may seem.\r\n\r\nAs a simple analogy, consider this situation: A man is sitting in his\r\nliving room late at night; the rest of the family have gone to bed.\r\nSuddenly he is startled by a loud noise somewhere upstairs. Trying to\r\naccount for the noise, he thinks of various possible causes--a burglar,\r\nthe “settling” of the house, a mouse in the wall, someone dropping a\r\nshoe, the wind rattling a door, the sonic boom from a distant plane.\r\nIf, without having further information, he decides that any one of\r\nthese is the true cause, he is accepting a guess as though it were a\r\nfact. The real cause of the noise may be one of these or it may be\r\nsomething else that he hasn’t even thought of.\r\n\r\nAmateur investigators of UFOs publish many reports which they\r\ncharacterize as absolute proof that spaceships exist. The expert,\r\nanalyzing the same reports, finds no proof at all because the actual\r\nfacts and the interpretations of the witnesses are hopelessly confused.\r\nAn early UFO case provides a typical example.\r\n\r\nAccording to Air Force records[I-2], on the morning of December 6,\r\n1952, a B-29 bomber was over the Gulf of Mexico returning from a\r\ntraining mission. At 5:25 A.M. the student radar operator, using an\r\nuncalibrated set, observed four bright blips (radar jargon for bright\r\nspots on a radarscope; such a spot indicates the presence of an object\r\nreflecting the radar pulses, but does not reveal the nature or shape\r\nof the object). The blips were apparently returns from objects about\r\ntwenty miles away, in no specific group, which rapidly moved off the\r\nscope. Similar groups of fast-moving blips appeared at intervals during\r\na period of about five minutes, and appeared also on two auxiliary\r\nradarscopes. After the first set was calibrated, the blips reappeared;\r\nnone was observed after 5:35 A.M. From the radar data estimates of size\r\nand distance were made; calculations based on these estimates indicated\r\na probable speed of 5000 to 9000 miles an hour. During the ten-minute\r\nperiod two visual observations were made, lasting about three seconds,\r\nwhich bore no obvious relation to the radar observations: at the right\r\nof the plane one crewman saw a single blue-white streak going from\r\nfront to rear under the wing, and another crewman saw two flashes of\r\nblue-white light.\r\n\r\nAn explanation of the incident was not found immediately, and ATIC at\r\nfirst classified it as an Unknown. Some saucer enthusiasts interpreted\r\nthe facts to mean that several groups of saucers had been in the area,\r\nmachines flying so fast that they were visible only as blue-white\r\nstreaks, whose presence was confirmed by radar. These conclusions were\r\nmerely deductions from fact, not observed facts. The radarscope is\r\nnot a camera and does not, at least at present, picture the shape or\r\nphysical structure of the phenomenon it reports; it shows only spots of\r\nlight that change position and size. Similarly, the blue-white streaks\r\nwere mere flashes of light without size or shape.\r\n\r\nIn a later study of the evidence, the Air Force experts recognized\r\nthis incident as one of false targets on radar (see _Chapter_ VIII).\r\nThe radar phantoms may have been caused by beacon returns triggered\r\nby another radar; by variations in the atmosphere; or, if “ducting”\r\nconditions existed, by reflections from objects that were far beyond\r\nthe normal range of the radar set. The blue-white flashes had no\r\nrelation to the radar returns and were probably meteors; the date\r\ncorresponded with the beginning of the annual Geminid shower (see\r\n_Chapter_ V).\r\n\r\nThis Gulf of Mexico incident is neither complicated nor puzzling. We\r\nmention it chiefly to illustrate why the saucer enthusiasts so often\r\ndisagree with the conclusions reached by the Air Force experts. The\r\namateur assumes that the instrument operated faultlessly and detected a\r\nsolid object; he uses these assumptions to interpret the data, uses the\r\ninterpretation as fact, and by this “bootstrap” process deludes himself\r\ninto thinking he has proved what he assumed in the first place.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Various Types of UFO_\r\n\r\nA biologist trying to identify a group of unusual animals which are\r\nsaid to represent a new species begins by collecting all possible\r\ninformation about their appearance and behavior. After he has\r\ndetermined their typical size, shape, color, mode of reproduction,\r\nmanner of locomotion, etc., he compares these characteristics with\r\nthose of animals of known species and eventually classifies the strange\r\nspecimens. In a similar way the professional investigator of UFO\r\nphenomena begins by asking the question: What is a typical unidentified\r\nflying object?\r\n\r\nThe published reports comprise a heterogeneous collection of facts,\r\nfiction, and guesses. The investigator must first separate and discard\r\naccounts that are obvious hoaxes or delusions. There are many of\r\nthese. The remaining material he divides into two classes. The first\r\nincludes statements made by competent, careful witnesses, describing\r\nwhat they have seen and heard--for example, “I saw a brilliant light\r\nmoving swiftly without sound.” The second class includes statements of\r\nopinion or belief about the thing seen--for example, “The strange light\r\nobviously was controlled by intelligence.” Putting aside this second\r\nclass of material for the time being, he looks at the information in\r\nthe first and immediately faces an awkward conclusion: apparently no\r\n“typical” flying saucer exists.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Descriptions of UFOs_\r\n\r\nNo two reports describe exactly the same kind of UFO. There are dozens\r\nof types of saucers, resembling each other as little as turnips do\r\ncomets. Hoping to find some consistent pattern, the investigator opens\r\nhis notebook and starts listing the data.\r\n\r\n_Shape_--The flying saucer varies greatly in shape (see Figure 1).\r\nAt different times and places it may be a circular disk like a\r\nsaucer, often with a small protrusion in the center like the knob on\r\na tea-kettle lid; elliptical or bean-shaped like a flattened sphere;\r\na circular base supporting a dome-like superstructure; a sphere\r\nsurrounded by a central platform, like Saturn in its rings; long and\r\nthin like a cigar; a tapered sphere like a teardrop; spindle-shaped,\r\nwith or without knobs on the ends; or a double- or triple-decked form\r\nlike a stack of plates.\r\n\r\n_Size_--The saucer varies greatly in size. Estimated diameters range\r\nfrom 20 or 30 feet to several thousand. While under observation it may\r\ninstantaneously increase or decrease in size.\r\n\r\n_Color_--The saucer varies greatly in color. It may be white, black,\r\ngray, red, blue, green, pink, yellow, silver; may be luminous or dull;\r\nmay be a solid color; may be circled by a central band of different\r\ncolor; may display flashing lights of various colors. It may change\r\ncolor or luminosity while being observed.\r\n\r\n_Motion_--The saucer displays a wide variety of motions. It may travel\r\nvery slowly; very fast, approaching the speed of light; at jet speed;\r\nat meteoric speed; may hover motionless over one place. At any speed it\r\ncan instantaneously change velocity and direction of motion--can move\r\nhorizontally, vertically, toward the observer, away from the observer,\r\nin a straight path, a zigzag, a spiral. Like the Cheshire cat, it can\r\nvanish instantly or slowly fade away.\r\n\r\n_Means of propulsion_--Unknown. Some saucers move in complete silence;\r\nothers produce noises: a hiss, a whistle, a roar, a thunderclap, or a\r\ndetonation like a sonic boom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 1._ Shapes of various reported UFOs.]\r\n\r\n_Incidence_--Saucers may appear at any hour of the day or night,\r\nbut they appear most frequently in the hours before and after sunset,\r\nand before and after sunrise. Their numbers may suddenly increase at\r\ncertain places and certain times. The objects can appear singly, in\r\nrandom groups, in groups showing a geometrical pattern. A single object\r\nmay split and multiply into a group, or a group may merge into one.\r\nSaucers almost always appear in the air, rarely on the earth’s surface\r\nor in bodies of water. They almost never come within touching distance\r\nof the observer. The length of their stay varies greatly, from about\r\ntwo seconds to two or three hours.\r\n\r\n_Structure_--Unknown. A saucer may be visible or invisible to the\r\nobserver; visible to the human eye but not to the camera or radar;\r\nvisible to the camera or radar but not to the eye. Some obey the laws\r\nof gravity and inertia, others do not.\r\n\r\n_Purpose_--Unknown. No officials in the government, the press,\r\nthe churches, or the universities have received any attempt at\r\ncommunication. No saucer has produced intelligible visible, audible, or\r\nradio signals.\r\n\r\nLong before finishing this tabulation the investigator realizes that\r\nhe is not dealing with one thing but with many. No single phenomenon\r\ncould possibly display such infinite variety. However, before he\r\nstarts trying to classify the descriptions and to explain them, he\r\ntakes a look at the second class of material--the conclusions offered\r\nby saucer enthusiasts. Leaving the realm of observation for that of\r\ninterpretation, he is suddenly catapulted into a world of fantasy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A “Baedeker’s Guide” to Saucerdom_\r\n\r\nOne of the commonest themes in science fiction is that of parallel\r\nuniverses--a number of nearly identical worlds coexisting in alternate\r\nspace-time continua. Occasionally, at a vulnerable spot, the barrier\r\nbetween two of these worlds will dissolve so that they overlap near\r\nthe point of contact. After such an accident a man may find himself\r\nunhappily living two lives at once, identical in some ways but so\r\ndifferent in others that if one is real, the other cannot be. Until the\r\nbreak is repaired and the incompatible worlds are safely separated once\r\nmore, the man exists in a state of desperate confusion and performs\r\nagonizing mental acrobatics, trying to maintain a foothold in both\r\nworlds until he can decide which one is valid.\r\n\r\nFrom the “damned” phenomena collected by Charles Fort, plus the legends\r\nof Atlantis, Mu, and Lemuria, flying-saucer addicts have constructed\r\na multiplicity of such alternate worlds. Although they differ in\r\nminor ways, all are in direct conflict with the real world known to\r\nscience. Let us ignore, for the moment, the descriptions given by\r\nthe “contactees” (_Chapter_ X) and consider only the beliefs and/or\r\ntheories offered by serious proponents of the interplanetary theory\r\nand publicized by writers such as Donald E. Keyhoe[I-3, I-4, I-5]\r\nAimé Michel[I-6], and Morris K. Jessup[I-7]. A “Baedeker’s Guide” to\r\nsaucerdom based solely on statements and speculations in the books\r\npublished by these investigators would portray a fantastic universe:[A]\r\n\r\n[A] Following common practice in scientific discussion, we originally\r\nincluded the specific sources of important and/or controversial ideas\r\ndescribed in this book and, for maximum accuracy, often used the\r\noriginal phrasing of the several authors involved. In this and certain\r\nother sections, however, we have been forced to abandon the more\r\nscholarly method of presentation because one author (Major Donald E.\r\nKeyhoe) refused permission to quote from his works.\r\n\r\n“In saucerdom, alien spacecraft continually visit the earth and have\r\ndone so for centuries. Constructed and controlled by intelligent\r\nextraterrestrial beings, the craft perhaps come from secret bases\r\non artificial earth satellites; on the moon; on Mars; on Venus; on\r\nJupiter; perhaps on the planets supposed to be orbiting the binary\r\nstars 61 Cygni and 70 Ophiuchi; or from planets supposed to be in orbit\r\naround the stars Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani, about eleven light-years\r\ndistant from earth. Radio transmitters serving as beacons for space\r\nnavigation may exist on both Venus and Jupiter.\r\n\r\n“These spacecraft can perform maneuvers that, on earth, are possible\r\nonly for rays of light. They fly at speeds of many thousands of miles\r\nan hour, can reverse direction instantaneously at any speed, ascend or\r\ndescend vertically, and hover motionless in the air. They accomplish\r\nthese feats perhaps by using the power of cosmic rays and by generating\r\nand manipulating artificial gravitational fields, which they could also\r\nuse to prevent the transmission of sound waves and to become invisible.\r\n\r\n“The extraterrestrial visitors may be explorers sent to study the\r\nearth, descendants of a race living thousands of light-years away from\r\nthe solar system. They may be the ancestors of the human race, which\r\nitself is a remnant of a colony established on earth thousands of years\r\nago and then abandoned. More than 300,000 years ago the inhabitants of\r\nearth had found the secret of space travel, and human beings mapped\r\nthe earth by an aerial survey at least 5000 years ago. It is also\r\npossible that these craft come not from space but from time; they may\r\nbe earthmen of the future who have traveled backward through time to\r\nexplore their own past.\r\n\r\n“The purpose of these visitors is still unknown. They shun close\r\ncontact with human beings, rarely if ever land their ships, and never\r\nallow close-up photographs, perhaps because they are afraid of human\r\nsavagery or are afraid of starting a panic. Nevertheless they attempt\r\nto signal to earthmen in various ways: they have caused the production\r\nof gigantic letters of the alphabet [U and Z] on earth radarscopes;\r\nfrom a material that radiates light they have built an enormous letter\r\nW, spanning more than 1000 miles on the surface of Mars; they have sent\r\nout wireless signals in Morse code to represent the letter S. They may\r\noccasionally abduct earthmen in order to use them as language teachers.\r\n\r\n“Although these visitors are probably not hostile to human beings,\r\nthey often manifest their presence in destructive ways. They cause\r\nmany airplane crashes; seize and carry off ships, human beings, and\r\nairplanes; destroy flocks of birds; interfere with the operation\r\nof radio, TV, gasoline and electric motors; pelt the earth with\r\nrocks, metal, and strange organic substances; create loud noises and\r\ndetonations; damage the windshields of cars; set fire to highways; hurl\r\nvarious types of missiles; drop chunks of ice; cause storms; and cause\r\nradioactive rain.\r\n\r\n“One of the most peculiar features of saucerdom is the role played by\r\ngovernment officials and scientists who, knowing the space visitors are\r\nreal, yet deny their existence and unite in a gigantic conspiracy to\r\ndeceive the public.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese excerpts from a hypothetical Baedeker have summarized the\r\nideas publicized by the most literate and most persuasive advocates\r\nof the saucer theory. The chapters that follow will examine certain\r\nflying-saucer cases. As the discussion continues and is able to account\r\nfor specific UFOs in terms of normal physical phenomena, these\r\nanarchistic worlds of saucerdom will gradually dissolve and merge with\r\nreality as we know it--a world that holds many mysteries but is still\r\nsubject to the laws of nature.\r\n\r\n[I-1] Fort, Charles. _Lo!_ New York: Claude H.

On the afternoon of June 24 Arnold was flying a private\r\nplane on his way from Chehalis to Yakima, Washington. Above the Cascade\r\nMountains at about 9200 feet, he noticed a series of bright flashes in\r\nthe sky off to his left. Looking for the cause, he saw what appeared\r\nto be a formation of peculiar aircraft approaching Mount Rainier at\r\nfantastic speed. There were nine very bright, disk-shaped objects which\r\nhe estimated to be twenty to twenty-five miles away, forty-five to\r\nfifty feet long, and traveling at a speed of almost 1700 miles an hour.\r\nTalking with a reporter that evening, Arnold said that the objects\r\n“flew like a saucer would if you skipped it across the water.” In a\r\nlater report to Air Force Intelligence he stated: “They flew very close\r\nto the mountaintops, directly south to southeast down the hogback of\r\nthe range, flying like geese in a diagonal, chainlike line, as if they\r\nwere linked together.... They were flat like a piepan and so shiny\r\nthey reflected the sun like a mirror.”[II-1]\r\n\r\nNewspapers all over the country picked up the story and printed it\r\nunder headlines describing flying pies, flying piepans, and flying\r\nsaucers. Alert to the possibility that the objects might have been a\r\nnew type of aircraft of Russian origin, investigators from Military\r\nIntelligence interviewed Arnold and officials from Air Technical\r\nIntelligence requested a report.\r\n\r\nNo one doubted Arnold’s word. He was an experienced pilot, a respected\r\ncitizen, and a careful observer. Nevertheless his description showed\r\nsome inconsistencies that made it difficult to decide what the nine\r\ndisks really were. If they had actually been forty-five or fifty feet\r\nlong, they must have been much closer than he thought; objects that\r\nsize would not have been visible at a distance of twenty to twenty-five\r\nmiles. However, if the estimated distance was correct, then in order to\r\nbe visible the objects must have been much larger, at least 210 feet\r\nlong. One of the estimates must be wrong--but which one? Until that\r\nquestion was settled, the computed speed was meaningless, since to\r\nestimate the velocity of a moving object an observer must know either\r\nits true distance or its true size. Even after a careful study, Air\r\nForce investigators could not identify the disks; they might have been\r\nclouds, a mirage, or some kind of aircraft, but no definite answer was\r\npossible from the evidence available.\r\n\r\nPredictably, after so much publicity, a rash of similar sightings\r\nbroke out all over the country and continued for the rest of the\r\nsummer. During the hot months of the “silly season,” newspapers are\r\ntraditionally hospitable to tales of barnyard freaks, sea serpents,\r\nand man-bitten dogs. Such stories were now shoved aside as people in\r\nevery state began to report unorthodox objects sailing through the\r\nsky--flying disks, flying dimes, flying ice-cream cones, flying shoe\r\nheels, and flying hubcaps. Seeing saucers became a national pastime,\r\nbut Arnold, who had reported the strange objects in all good faith,\r\nresented the implied ridicule. Deluged with telephone calls and mail,\r\nhe resolved to keep silent in the future even if he should happen to\r\nsee a ten-story building flying through the air.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the publicity, the flying-saucer scare would probably have\r\ndied with the first frost of autumn but for the efforts of a talented\r\nwriter, editor, and publisher of science fiction, Raymond A. Palmer.\r\nAmong the many letters Arnold received was one from Palmer, then editor\r\nof _Amazing Stories_. Tired of being laughed at, Arnold found the tone\r\nof “sincere interest” so appealing that he answered the letter[II-2].\r\nAfter a second letter a week later, he changed his mind about keeping\r\nsilent and agreed to sell his story for publication.\r\n\r\nUnder the title, “I _Did_ See the Flying Disks,” the article appeared\r\nin the first issue of a new magazine, _Fate_, which published “true\r\nstories of the strange, the unusual, the unknown.”[II-3] Although\r\nArnold was not a professional writer, he had the assistance of an\r\nexpert and produced a vivid, clearly written story--Palmer had had\r\nunusual experience in helping fledgling authors tell their tales.\r\nInteresting differences between Arnold’s original statements and those\r\nin the magazine version demonstrate how much he must have owed to\r\neditorial help. Without it, he might not have included certain colorful\r\ndetails that he had apparently overlooked earlier. In his original\r\nreports, for example, he said that he had at first supposed the disks\r\nto be some type of experimental aircraft; in the magazine version he\r\nadded that, even at the time, the objects had given him “an eerie\r\nfeeling.” In the intervening months he had also remembered more about\r\ntheir shape (see Figure 2). He no longer described them as saucerlike,\r\nflat and shiny like piepans. Instead, a drawing based on his revised\r\naccount shows an object like the crescent moon with a sharp protrusion\r\non the inner, concave side and a dark, mottled circle marking the\r\ncenter of the top surface. Furthermore, he told the readers of _Fate_,\r\none object had been darker than the others and of a slightly different\r\nform--a detail he had forgotten to mention to reporters, to military\r\nofficials, to his friends, or even to his wife.\r\n\r\nArnold had never been much of a reader and was not a science-fiction\r\nfan, but his interests were obviously widening. The next two issues\r\nof _Fate_ carried other articles under his name. Palmer’s growing\r\ninfluence is suggested by the titles: “Are Space Visitors Here?”[II-4]\r\nand “Phantom Lights of Nevada.”[II-5]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 2._ Arnold’s flying saucers. Left, as first\r\ndescribed; right, as later sketched.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Great Shaver Mystery_\r\n\r\nRay Palmer lays claim to being “the _first_ flying saucer\r\ninvestigator”[II-6], although he frankly admits his debt to the\r\nwritings of Charles Fort. Any full account of the saucer era must\r\ninclude the names of other enthusiasts such as Adamski, Bethurum,\r\nScully, Cramp, Keyhoe, Jessup, Michel, and Wilkins, but none merits so\r\nmuch credit for keeping the saucers flying as does Palmer. He not only\r\nopened the pages of his magazines to the first saucer reports but also,\r\nin the beginning, paid the witnesses for their stories.\r\n\r\nIn 1947 Palmer was the editor of _Amazing Stories_ and _Fantastic\r\nAdventures_, two of the great magazines of science fiction in which\r\nstories of spaceships and interplanetary travel have long been\r\ncommonplace. For several years he had been hinting to readers of these\r\nmagazines that alien spaceships might _actually_ be cruising in our\r\nskies, but _Fate_ was the first magazine that seriously promoted the\r\nidea. No man was better qualified to glimpse the dramatic possibilities\r\nof flying saucers. Born in Wisconsin in 1910, Palmer had begun reading\r\n_Amazing Stories_ soon after it started publication in 1926. Turning to\r\nwriting, he showed the remarkable persistence that has characterized\r\nhis life. Although he received 100 rejections before he sold his second\r\nstory, he stubbornly kept on until he not only achieved success as an\r\nauthor but also, in 1938, became managing editor of _Amazing Stories_\r\nfor the Ziff-Davis Publishing Company. Under Palmer’s guidance, “...\r\nthe entertainment side of science fiction took over.... Gone were the\r\nponderous styles, the verbiage, the highly technical explanations of\r\nwhat mattered little in the first place. The stories took on pace and\r\nexcitement, the characters in them were faced with human problems, the\r\ndialogue was realistic....”[II-7]\r\n\r\nAlert to the tastes of his readers, Palmer carried the magazine to new\r\nheights. Many science-fiction fans (including the present authors)\r\nstill remember that golden age around 1940 when _Amazing_ came out\r\nevery month with 146 pages full of startling, fantastic, wonderful\r\nstories of how life might be on other worlds and in other galaxies.\r\n\r\nIn January 1944 began the publishing drama that for a time changed the\r\ndirection of _Amazing_ and heralded the advent of flying saucers. The\r\n“Discussions” department that month included a letter captioned “An\r\nAncient Language?” which introduced what came to be known both as the\r\nGreat Shaver Mystery and the Great Shaver Hoax. Signed “S. Shaver,” the\r\nletter began:\r\n\r\n“Sirs: Am sending you this in hopes you will insert in an issue to keep\r\nit from dying with me. It would arouse a lot of discussion.”[II-8]\r\n\r\nIt did indeed. The letter announced the discovery that words and\r\nsyllables of the ancient Atlantean language still exist in English\r\ntoday; hence the legends of Atlantis must be true and a “wiser race\r\nthan modern man” must once have existed on the earth.\r\n\r\nRichard Sharpe Shaver was then living in Barto, Pennsylvania, and\r\noperated a welding machine in a war plant. In writing to thank the\r\neditor for publishing his letter, he enclosed a manuscript called\r\n“Warning to Future Man” which purported to give his memories of life\r\nin the fabled continent of Lemuria. The information had been preserved\r\nin “thought records” hidden in secret caves. By “telaug,” a kind of\r\naudio-visual telepathy, he had begun to remember his forgotten past\r\nwhen, through the noise of his welding machine, he heard voices. After\r\nvisiting Shaver and probing his “memories,” Palmer bought the story. He\r\ndidn’t like the way it was written, however, so he rewrote it, added\r\nmaterial that expanded it to three times its original length[II-9],\r\nchanged the title to “I Remember Lemuria,” and started advertising it\r\nwell in advance of publication as a _true_ story:\r\n\r\n“Twelve thousand years ago the Lemurians and the Atlanteans disappeared\r\nfrom the Earth. Where and why did they go?”[II-10] This story would\r\nshow that Newton and Einstein were all wrong, Palmer promised, and\r\nwould reveal new concepts of gravity, the nature of matter, and the\r\nfoundation for physical mathematics.\r\n\r\nThus began the controversy that rocked the world of science fiction.\r\nSince Palmer has affirmed that “Flying saucers are a part of the Shaver\r\nMystery--integrally so”[II-11], we turn to the old files of _Amazing\r\nStories_ to trace their development.\r\n\r\nThe first of the Shaver series, “I Remember Lemuria” appeared in March\r\n1945[II-12], along with “Mantong, The Language of Lemuria,” an article\r\nsigned by both Shaver and Palmer, and other stories followed quickly\r\nin succeeding issues of _Amazing_. The basic themes were shopworn--a\r\njumble of Fortean ideas, Plato’s fables, and mystic science--but when\r\nbrightened by Palmer’s magic pencil, they seemed fresh and exciting:\r\nThe earth had an ancient past, now forgotten. The lost continents of\r\nAtlantis, Lemuria, and Mu had been colonized many thousands of years\r\nago by superior beings from another planet who could travel through\r\nspace by utilizing forces unknown to present-day earthmen. Eventually\r\nthese noble aliens had been forced to abandon the earth to escape evil\r\nradiations coming from our sun, but they had left descendants who still\r\nlived on earth in concealment in great subterranean cities that could\r\nbe entered through certain caves. The underground dwellers in the\r\nhidden world had retained all the secret powers of their ancestors.\r\nThey could communicate by thought transference, could speak to earthmen\r\nby mental “voices,” and could travel on beams of light because they\r\nunderstood the true nature of gravity and magnetism. These creatures\r\nwere divided into two opposing groups, one good and one evil. The\r\ndero (detrimental robots) were the bad guys and they caused all the\r\nunexplained accidents and misfortunes that happen to human beings.\r\nThe tero (integrative robots) were the good guys; they warned earthmen\r\nof danger and tried to protect them from the destructive forces of the\r\ndero.\r\n\r\nReader response to these fantasies was phenomenal. Fan mail zoomed from\r\n40 or 50 to 2500 letters a month[II-13], and the magazine’s circulation\r\nincreased by some 50,000. As the records of “racial memory” continued\r\nto appear, connoisseurs of good science fiction began to cry “Hoax!”\r\nbut their protests had no effect. Thousands of new readers were buying\r\nthe magazine and many of them were beginning to recall and report\r\n“memories” of their own. Since the “Discussions” columns could not\r\ntake care of so many letters, Palmer opened a new department, “Report\r\nfrom the Forgotten Past”[II-14], and urged the readers to send in\r\ntheir personal experiences with the hidden world. Did they ever hear\r\nstrange voices? Receive mysterious messages through the air? Suspect\r\nthat they were being affected by strange rays? Feel that they had\r\nbeen put on earth for some special mission? Have dreams that they\r\ncould not explain? Have a strong urge to explore caves? Have memories\r\nof other lives? The editor was eager to learn of all such incidents.\r\nThrough the Shaver stories, Palmer was already promoting the idea that\r\ninterplanetary craft do visit the earth:\r\n\r\n“There are many mysteries of the past that have intrigued investigators\r\nto an almost unbearable point.... What were the glories of Babylon?\r\nWhat truth is there in the Chinese legend of being the people of the\r\nMoon, and of coming to Earth in rocket ships? What was the mystery\r\nmetal of the Lemurians, orichalcum? What was the secret of their\r\nairships that walked on beams of light?”[II-12]\r\n\r\nWhen one correspondent informed him that space travel was possible “if\r\none travels through curves but not through angles,” Palmer replied,\r\n“Your editor is sincere--and he’d like to know everything you know....\r\nFor instance, please explain this space-travel business--about curves\r\nand not angles.”[II-15]\r\n\r\nFor more than three years the columns of _Amazing_ continued to assert,\r\nnot as fiction but as fact, that interplanetary travel is a present\r\nreality and that the laws of physics are not valid. In a mystic mumbo\r\njumbo the readers were told that the velocity of light, for example,\r\nwas not the ultimate speed:\r\n\r\n“Light speed is due to ‘escape velocity’ on the sun, which is not\r\nlarge. This speed is a constant to our measurement because the friction\r\nof exd, which fills all space, holds down any increase unless there\r\nis more impetus. The escape velocity of light from a vaster sun than\r\nours is higher, but once again exd slows the light speed down to its\r\nconstant by friction, so that when it reaches the vicinity of our\r\nsun, no appreciable difference is to be noted. A body can travel at\r\nmany times the exd constant, under additional impetus, such as rocket\r\nexplosions. A ship whose weight is reduced to a very little by reverse\r\ngravity beam can attain a great speed with a very small rocket.”[II-12]\r\n\r\nDevotees of reasonable science fiction (who include many leading\r\nscientists) were writing angrily to Palmer, protesting that the Shaver\r\nhoax had gone too far, but their letters seemed only to amuse him:\r\n\r\n“There have been some odd reactions, one of them being a promise by a\r\nfan group to ‘expose’ our ‘hoax’ (which was a compliment, by the way,\r\nbecause it was termed the ‘biggest ever attempted in modern science\r\nfiction history’). We are waiting for this expose, [_sic_] with\r\ninterest--because we are curious to know how a hoax which is not a hoax\r\ncan be exposed as a hoax. We realize that a lot of our readers find it\r\ndifficult to believe that we ourselves believe one single word of what\r\nMr. Shaver tells us in his stories, but we’ll keep on presenting the\r\nevidence as it comes in, and you can judge for yourself.”[II-14]\r\n\r\nReaders continued to object and many stopped buying the magazine, but\r\nPalmer persisted with ambiguous hints that spaceships were really here.\r\nA full year before the first flying-saucer report he wrote:\r\n\r\n“If you don’t think space ships visit the earth regularly, as in this\r\nstory [‘Cult of the Witch Queen’], then the files of Charles Fort and\r\nyour editor’s own files are something you should see.... And if you\r\nthink responsible parties in world governments are ignorant of the\r\nfact of space ships visiting earth, you just don’t think the way we\r\ndo.”[II-16]\r\n\r\nIn succeeding months he became more and more explicit. In September\r\n1946 he told one correspondent, “As for space ships, ... personally we\r\nbelieve these ships do visit the earth. You, or any observer, would be\r\ninclined to call it something else if you did see one.”[II-15] In the\r\nspring of 1947 he replied to a reader who asked for concrete evidence\r\nthat Shaver’s stories were true: “... the mystery is not just ‘are\r\nthere caves with dero and tero in them?’ but it has to do with space\r\nships, other inhabited worlds, and so on.”[II-17]\r\n\r\nIn June 1947, the month the first flying saucers were reported, the\r\nissue of _Amazing Stories_ was an addict’s dream[II-18]. The cover\r\nfeatured “The Shaver Mystery, the Most Sensational True Story Ever\r\nTold”; the four stories, 90,000 words, were all under the byline of\r\nRichard S. Shaver. The entire magazine--editorial comments, discussion\r\ncolumns, and most of the feature articles--was devoted to the\r\nsupernatural world of Shaver.\r\n\r\nBut the end was near. _Amazing_ published its last Shaver story, “Gods\r\nof Venus,” in the summer of 1948; as far as the magazine was concerned,\r\nthe mystery was dead.\r\n\r\nWho or what killed it? One version says that the publisher, William B.\r\nZiff, ordered the series stopped because so many fans had quit buying\r\nthe magazine. Palmer himself has given various explanations. He stopped\r\nthe stories, he said at first, when he realized that such material\r\ndid not really belong in a fiction magazine. Later he explained that\r\nhe killed the mystery because he intended to go into publishing for\r\nhimself and didn’t want to leave his successor to handle “this hot\r\npotato.”[II-19] Later still, he implied that publishing the stories\r\nwas dangerous; that he had learned too much about the “hidden world,”\r\nthe sinister forces responsible for the plane crash that followed\r\nthe Tacoma hoax. Said Palmer, “I wanted no more dead men on my\r\nhands.”[II-11]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Maury Island Fragments_\r\n\r\nThe Maury Island Mystery, a complex and eventually tragic affair,\r\noccurred near Tacoma, Washington, less than 100 miles from the place\r\nwhere Arnold had sighted the nine disks. In this mystery, too, Palmer\r\nwas involved. According to their story, two harbor patrolmen named\r\nHarold A. Dahl and Fred L. Crisman on June 31 had observed a group\r\nof six flying disks that hovered over their boat near Maury Island\r\nand jammed their radio when they tried to notify the authorities. One\r\nof the disks had seemed to be disabled, had showered down lavalike\r\nmetallic fragments that damaged the boat and killed the dog on board;\r\nthe disks had then disappeared but the fragments remained as proof\r\nof the visit. The men also claimed to have taken some pictures that\r\nshowed the six objects but were fogged as though by radiation. Back on\r\nshore, they had not telephoned the newspapers nor had they notified any\r\ngovernment officials. Instead, they had mailed a box of the fragments\r\nto Ray Palmer, to prove that they had actually seen an accident to a\r\nflying saucer[II-20].\r\n\r\nCrisman was no stranger to _Amazing Stories_. A science-fiction fan,\r\nhe apparently had accepted the Shaver stories as literal truth. More\r\nthan a year before the Maury Island episode he had written to Palmer,\r\nwarning him that the knowledge contained in the Shaver stories was too\r\ndangerous to print. Identifying himself as an ex-Air Force pilot who\r\nhad flown the Hump, Crisman explained that when he was in Burma, he had\r\nbeen exploring a cave when a dero attacked him with a mysterious ray\r\nthat made a hole the size of a dime in his arm. Palmer had kept up the\r\ncorrespondence[II-21] and, some months later, received a telephone call\r\nfrom Crisman, then in Texas: for $250, said Crisman, he would descend\r\ninto a cave and take some actual pictures of the mysterious underground\r\nmachines that Shaver had described. The result of this offer is not\r\nknown, but in July 1947 Palmer received another letter from Crisman; he\r\nhad witnessed an accident to a flying saucer and was sending a box of\r\nthe fragments as proof[II-22].\r\n\r\nPalmer considered buying the story for _Fate_, but first he asked\r\nArnold, living close to the scene, to investigate the tale. Arnold\r\nagreed. Thus the first man to report flying saucers became also a\r\nvictim of the first flying-saucer hoax.\r\n\r\nWith an advance of $200 for expenses, Arnold flew to Tacoma and into\r\na nightmare of mystery. The two men were elusive, their story full of\r\ndiscrepancies, their manner evasive. Wondering at first whether the\r\naffair was a hoax, Arnold finally attributed the strange behavior of\r\nthe men to their fear of hostile saucers. Alarmed, he called in the\r\nhelp of Army Intelligence. Two officers arrived from Hamilton Air Force\r\nBase, California, and made a careful investigation. They found that\r\nDahl and Crisman were not “harbor patrolmen” but salvagers of floating\r\nlumber; their boat was scarcely seaworthy and showed no evidence of\r\nmajor repairs; they couldn’t remember what they had done with the\r\npictures they mentioned; and although the saucer accident was supposed\r\nto have occurred nearly six weeks earlier, they had never notified\r\nthe authorities or even mentioned it to a reporter. The only evidence\r\noffered for the truth of their tale was the collection of “strange”\r\nfragments which were later found to be slag from a local smelter plant.\r\nSimilar fragments could be found by the ton on Maury Island[II-20].\r\n\r\nThe officers concluded that they had wasted their time on a flagrant\r\nhoax, but the bewildered Arnold insisted that they take some of the\r\nfragments for analysis. Unhappily, on the way back to the base the\r\nplane crashed and although two passengers parachuted to safety, both\r\nofficers were killed. At once fantastic rumors sprang up: that the\r\nTacoma “disks” had been spaceships, and that the beings who operated\r\nthe craft had been forced to arrange the plane crash so that no one\r\ncould analyze the fragments of their disabled spaceship. Arnold himself\r\nseemed to believe that the crash had resulted from extraplanetary\r\nsabotage, but investigation showed a more ordinary cause. A burned\r\nexhaust stack had set the left wing afire; the blazing wing had then\r\nbroken from the fuselage and torn off the plane’s tail.\r\n\r\nFor a time government officials considered placing a charge of fraud\r\nagainst the two men who had started the unhappy chain of events. After\r\nfurther questioning, both had admitted that their “sighting” had been a\r\nhoax, planned merely to make their story more salable, but when first\r\nArnold and then Military Intelligence had entered the picture, the\r\nhoax had simply gotten out of hand. Since the men obviously had never\r\nintended the tragic outcome and were not directly responsible for it,\r\nthe idea of prosecution was abandoned[II-1].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Science Fiction Adopts the Saucers_\r\n\r\nNo longer editor of _Amazing_, Palmer continued to promote the\r\ncause of flying saucers in the pages of _Fate_. During the early\r\nnineteen-fifties, the boom years of science fiction, he started other\r\nmagazines--_Search_, _Mystic Universe_, _Other Worlds Science Stories_.\r\nAfter a time, _Fate_ began to concentrate on tales of the mystic and\r\noccult, while _Other Worlds_ eventually took over the flying-saucer\r\ntheme.\r\n\r\nStarting as an orthodox magazine of science fiction, _Other Worlds_\r\nflourished until the general slump in the market caused it to suspend\r\npublication. Revived after a time, it has undergone several changes\r\nof editorial policy reflected in its changing names: _Other Worlds\r\nScience Stories_, _Flying Saucers from OTHER WORLDS_, _FLYING SAUCERS\r\nfrom Other Worlds_, _Flying Saucers the Magazine of Space Conquest_,\r\nand, since the spring of 1961 when the magazine became pocket-size,\r\njust _Flying Saucers_. Classic science fiction long ago vanished from\r\nits pages and all articles are “true” accounts of flying saucers and\r\nsimilar Fortean incidents.\r\n\r\n_Flying Saucers_ is probably unique in modern publishing history.\r\nIssued monthly or bimonthly at a price of thirty-five cents, the\r\nmagazine does not pay its authors because, as the editor explains,\r\n“_Flying Saucers_ is _not_ a commercial project.” Published by\r\nPalmer Publications, edited by Palmer, containing liberal amounts of\r\neditorial comment and at least one article by Palmer, a typical issue\r\nin 1960[II-6] contained sixty-six pages and carried a small number of\r\nadvertisements for telescopes, binoculars, Rosicrucian and similar\r\nmystic publications. The remaining ads featured books and magazines\r\nissued by Palmer Publications, Amherst, Wisconsin; books issued by\r\nAmherst Press, also of Amherst, Wisconsin; Saucerian Books, published\r\nunder the aegis of Gray Barker, a contributing editor to _Flying\r\nSaucers_. “Austrogen,” described as a face cream or clay for skin\r\nailments, was obtainable from Palmer at a dollar an ounce. Another\r\nad recommended something (the wording does not specify exactly what,\r\nperhaps a powder?) that helps make good chili. Readers could buy this\r\ntoo, from Palmer, for a dollar a pound or $3.50 for five pounds. A\r\ncombination dandruff remover, itch preventer, and restorer of hair\r\ncolor personally recommended by Palmer sold for $5.00 a bottle, number\r\nof ounces not specified.\r\n\r\nThe dandruff remover was also recommended by Kenneth Arnold, whose\r\nflying disks had started the saucer epidemic. Arnold was advertising\r\nhis “World Society of Flying Saucer” which would “hold no meetings, no\r\nminutes, no by-laws, no restrictions or regulations, no records outside\r\nof actual membership, no presidents, no vice-presidents, no secretary,\r\nor board of directors.” For only $5.00 those who joined the society\r\nwould receive twelve issues of _Flying Saucers_ (which if ordered from\r\nPalmer Publications would have cost $4.00), plus an official membership\r\ncard. Arnold also offered for sale a crescent-shaped lapel pin in solid\r\nsilver, supposedly just like the “original” saucers he had sighted in\r\n1947; and, for the ladies, the saucers in pendant form. The addition of\r\nseven-point diamonds was optional.\r\n\r\nThe magazine has grown smaller, but its main theme is still flying\r\nsaucers, which until recently have been interpreted as interplanetary\r\nvehicles. In December 1959, however,[II-23] Palmer announced in a lead\r\narticle that flying saucers were _not_ from outer space after all;\r\ninstead, they came from secret earth bases located under the north and\r\nthe south poles. The earth is actually shaped like a doughnut, not like\r\na pear, he says, and has openings at both poles where the saucer people\r\nreside. Whether they are manned by dero or tero he has not said.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1962, Arnold entered the arena of politics and was\r\nthe Republican nominee for lieutenant governor of Idaho, but lost.\r\nShaver became a dairy farmer, a Wisconsin neighbor of Palmer’s, but in\r\nscience-fiction circles his name will never die. Recently he has been\r\nadvertising the sale of alleged pre-Deluge and pre-Ice-Age “art stones”\r\ndescribed as rare, voluptuous, exciting, and usable as ornaments for\r\nwall or mantel, or simply as book ends.\r\n\r\nPalmer has now revived the Shaver Mystery and is reprinting the entire\r\nseries in book form “with the fiction removed,” under the general\r\ntitle of _The Hidden World_. In advertising the new project he stated,\r\n“This magazine concerns flying saucers. Flying saucers are a part\r\nof the Shaver mystery--integrally so.” He abandoned the stories in\r\n_Amazing_, he says, not because an outraged publisher insisted, but\r\nbecause he believed the stories to be true. “That is the true motive.\r\nI was convinced that not only was there a ‘hidden world,’ but it was\r\none of immense ramification, and the caves of the dero, flying saucers,\r\nmilitary espionage, the political science of the world, and even some\r\nphases of religion, specifically those of the ‘cult’ variety, were\r\ninextricably linked.” In announcing that he intended to end the secrecy\r\nthat had existed for so long, and to tell the truth after seventeen\r\nyears of “sugar-coating” the facts, he did not explain exactly why he\r\nfeels it is safe to publish the “truth” now, when it was not safe\r\nseventeen years ago. He says only, “... there have been good reasons\r\nfor the delay--had it been done from the beginning, the pitfalls that\r\nwould have crushed it could not have been avoided.”[II-11]\r\n\r\nAt the tenth annual World Science Fiction Convention, held in Chicago\r\nin September 1952, fans and fellow editors awarded to Palmer a bronze\r\nplaque honoring him as a “son of science fiction,”[II-24] a citation he\r\nfully merits. As long as flying saucers continue to make good copy and\r\nsell magazines, Palmer will probably keep them soaring--whether their\r\nhome bases are other planets or polar caves. As one of his colleagues\r\nonce commented:\r\n\r\n“... in these times of drab and unconvincing falsehood, there is still\r\nsomething to be thankful for. A Palmer promotion has the touch of\r\ngenius. It has zing, sparkle, and true showmanship. It can be spotted a\r\nmile away by the bright lights. The thing to do is sit back and enjoy\r\nit.”[II-19]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mirage or Wave Clouds?_\r\n\r\nWhat did Kenneth Arnold actually see, that June afternoon in 1947?\r\nNo absolutely certain answer is possible after so long a time. The\r\ndisks were probably a mirage (see Figure 3) in which the peaks of\r\nthe mountains seemed to float above the mountain chain[II-25]. An\r\nalternative but much less probable explanation is that he observed\r\norographic clouds, a type unique to mountainous country, which often\r\nappear to stand more or less motionless and can assume dramatic shapes.\r\n“Grindstone” clouds, shaped like thick, solid disks (see Plate Ia),\r\nare common phenomena in the valleys just east of the Sierra Nevada in\r\nCalifornia and in the mountainous regions of Washington, Colorado,\r\nand New Mexico--areas where flying-saucer reports have tended to\r\nconcentrate[II-26]. One of the most spectacular types of mountain\r\ncloud, it closely resembles the “_pile d’assiettes_” or “stack of\r\nplates” formation in which the cloud assumes a flat, round shape like\r\na plate or a saucer, and two or more are piled together in a neat\r\nstack, as in Plate Ib[II-27]. Another picture of a “stack of plates”\r\n(which some observers reported as a hovering flying saucer) was made on\r\nMay 31, 1953, near Jindabyna, Snowy Mountains, New South Wales, and\r\nreproduced in _Weather_ in November 1954 Plate 47. The cloud formed\r\nover a tub-shaped depression in the mountains and remained stationary\r\nfor more than an hour[II-28].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 3._ Mirage of mountain peaks. Top, normal view\r\nof mountain chain; bottom, mirage in which some of the peaks seem to be\r\ndetached and above the peaks, like saucers.]\r\n\r\nSuch clouds reflect the undulations of lee waves formed in the\r\natmosphere when stable currents of air flow over obstacles such as\r\nhills or mountains. An up-and-down wave motion may be impressed upon\r\nthe air, provided that temperature and wind conditions are suitable.\r\nAs the air describes its wavelike path, it alternately warms and\r\ncools, the warming taking place as it sinks into the wave trough and\r\nthe cooling as it ascends to the wave crest. If the air is very dry,\r\nthe undulating current will not be visible to the eye, although the\r\nupdrafts and downdrafts will readily be felt by aircraft that chance\r\nto pass through them. On the other hand, if the air before entering the\r\nwave is moist enough, the cooling in the wave crest will cause water\r\ndroplets to condense and a cloud to appear.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of an isolated peak the cloud may assume the form of a\r\ncap covering the summit, or it may be displaced slightly downwind and\r\nresemble a lens or disk. Not infrequently a series of lenticular clouds\r\nwill appear, trailing downwind at regular intervals of a few miles.\r\nAlthough these wave clouds are usually stationary, they sometimes move\r\nat great speed, especially when the air temperature is changing rapidly.\r\n\r\nFrom a study of a remarkable photograph made in 1956, R. J. Reed of\r\nthe University of Washington has offered the suggestion that the disks\r\nArnold saw were actually wave clouds in rapid motion.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of December 29, 1956, a photographer for the Seattle\r\n_Times_ was on top of Pigtail Peak near White Pass, Washington (not\r\nfar from the area where Arnold’s nine disks had appeared), taking ski\r\npictures for the rotogravure section of the Sunday _Times_. The weather\r\nwas beautiful. Down in the pass temperatures hovered near freezing,\r\nbut the slopes were warmed by sunlight that filtered down through thin\r\ncirrus clouds and raised the temperature to a balmy fifty degrees. Just\r\nat sunset a strange object suddenly appeared off toward the northeast\r\nhorizon. Several skiers urged the photographer to take a picture of the\r\n“flying saucer,” but since it was still far away and indistinct, he\r\nwaited. The first object, now followed by a second one, moved rapidly\r\ntoward Mount Rainier, began to sharpen in outline, and both were soon\r\nso clearly visible that he was able to snap his unusual picture. The\r\nphotograph shows two apparently solid, disklike objects, flattened,\r\nbrilliantly white but dark at the bottom, apparently linked together by\r\nwhite streamers, skimming toward the mountain peak (Plate Ia).\r\n\r\nRecognizing the close resemblance between the objects in the photograph\r\nand those Arnold described, Reed made a full analysis of the weather\r\nconditions prevailing at the time the picture was taken. From\r\nradiosonde data provided by the Seattle-Tacoma Airport, he obtained\r\nmeasurements of the size of the clouds, their height above the\r\nmountains, wind directions, and temperature and humidity at mountain\r\nheight and cloud height. Obviously the pattern of weather conditions\r\nthat prevailed that day was suitable for the formation of saucerlike\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nTo test the hypothesis that Arnold also had seen such clouds, he then\r\nobtained records of the weather data for June 24, 1947, to determine\r\nwhether atmospheric conditions on the two dates were basically similar.\r\n“To be comparable, winds would have to be blowing from the north or\r\nnorthwest in Mr. Arnold’s case since the objects were sighted to the\r\nsouth and southeast of the peak. The air would have to be dry at lower\r\nelevations and moisture would have to be spreading in at higher levels.\r\nAn inspection of the historical maps reveals that, indeed, all these\r\nconditions were met.”[II-29]\r\n\r\nReed concludes that, although we can never know for certain, the\r\nimplication that the _Times_ photographer and Kenneth Arnold viewed\r\nessentially the same phenomenon seems “inescapable.” This interesting\r\nhypothesis, however, requires the presence of undulating air currents\r\nand turbulence great enough to endanger a plane in flight. Since Arnold\r\nspecifically mentioned the smooth, calm flying, the mirage explanation\r\nremains the most probable one.\r\n\r\n[II-1] Air Force Files.\r\n\r\n[II-2] Arnold, K., and Palmer, R.

Carrying cases of\r\nheavy instruments, the balloons were launched from various Air Force\r\nbases to collect information about the atmosphere high above the earth,\r\nthe winds in the stratosphere, and the incidence of cosmic rays.\r\nSoaring upward, they traveled in courses determined by the winds and\r\nchanged in direction and speed as they shifted from one wind stream to\r\nanother. Even at heights of 60,000 feet these objects with their highly\r\nreflecting surfaces could be seen from the ground (see Figure 4). Such\r\nballoons were especially noticeable against dark-blue skies, which\r\nare much more common in the western United States than in the eastern\r\nareas. They could reach heights of 100,000 feet, higher than our planes\r\ncould go. Once considered as a means for collecting information for\r\nMilitary Intelligence, a task later assumed by the U-2 jets, they could\r\ntravel across the entire continent and even across the oceans. If the\r\nplastic skin developed a leak, the resulting loss of gas altered both\r\nthe appearance and the behavior of the balloon; if the leak became\r\ngreat enough the balloon shriveled and eventually fell to the earth.\r\nAt high altitudes where the cold was extreme, the skin might become\r\nbrittle and the balloon would burst into fragments to be dispersed by\r\nthe winds and vanish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 4._ Shapes of various balloons. A, Skyhook at\r\nlaunching; B, Skyhook at high altitude; C, radiosonde or pibal; D,\r\nballoon cluster; E, blimp or sausage-shaped balloon.]\r\n\r\nAlthough these balloons were sometimes visible at distances of fifty or\r\nsixty miles and were very conspicuous, officially they did not exist\r\nuntil 1950 when Dr. Urner Liddel of the Office of Naval Research\r\nreleased the facts behind the Skyhook balloon program. He pointed\r\nout then that the balloons had given rise to many reports of flying\r\nsaucers. If the Skyhook project had been public knowledge in 1948 and\r\nif information about their launching and movements had not been a\r\nmatter of security, a courageous pilot might still be alive today and\r\nthe infant flying-saucer myth would have died long ago. There can be\r\nlittle question that Captain Mantell crashed in trying to intercept a\r\nSkyhook balloon, an object he had never heard of.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Mantell Tragedy_\r\n\r\nThe basic facts of the Mantell case, the second of the “classic”[B]\r\nUFO sightings, are familiar to all who have studied flying-saucer\r\nphenomena[III-1, p. 51]. Early on the afternoon of January 7, 1948,\r\nthe Kentucky State Highway Patrol received a large number of calls from\r\nthe towns of Maysville, Owensboro, and Irvington, reporting a strange\r\nobject moving west at high speed. Alerted by the police, officials at\r\nGodman Air Force Base, near Ft. Knox, began looking for the unknown\r\ncraft. They soon located the object but could not identify it. Watching\r\nit through binoculars, various observers described its shape as\r\ncircular, like a teardrop, or rounded and tapered like a parachute\r\nor an ice-cream cone. At about 2:30 P.M. (all times in this account\r\nare E.S.T.), as they were discussing the object, a flight of four\r\nP-51 planes approached the base from the south. Led by Captain Thomas\r\nMantell, the planes were being ferried from Marietta Air Base, Georgia,\r\nto Standiford Field near Louisville. The tower operator at Godman\r\nthereupon radioed Captain Mantell for assistance:\r\n\r\n[B] A “classic” in the literature of flying saucers is a particularly\r\ndramatic UFO incident whose specific cause has not yet been found or,\r\nif found, cannot be absolutely proved from the evidence available.\r\nLacking a completely airtight explanation, official investigators\r\nclassify the case as Unknown. Saucer fans classify it as proof that\r\nflying saucers exist.\r\n\r\n“We have an object out south of Godman here that we are unable to\r\nidentify and we would like to know if you have gas enough and if so\r\ncould you take a look for us if you will.”\r\n\r\nThe ferry had been planned as a low-level flight and none of the planes\r\nhad been serviced with oxygen. Captain Mantell, a combat pilot in World\r\nWar II, nevertheless agreed to help out: “Roger. I have the gas and I\r\nwill take a look for you if you will give me the correct heading and\r\nany information you have on locating the object.”\r\n\r\nThe talk between Godman tower and Captain Mantell was not recorded\r\nand transmission was sometimes garbled. Although many persons heard\r\nthe exchange of remarks during the next critical minutes and agreed\r\non the general content, no two remembered exactly the same words;\r\ntherefore the official reports[III-2] represent only the best possible\r\nreconstruction of the conversation that took place.\r\n\r\nOne plane, short of fuel, continued on to Louisville. The other three\r\ncircled and began to climb. At about 2:45 Mantell notified the tower\r\nthat he was at about 15,000 feet: “I have an object in sight above and\r\nahead of me, and it appears to be moving at about half my speed or\r\napproximately 180 miles an hour.” One of his wing men said: “What the\r\nhell are we looking for?” When Godman asked Mantell to describe the\r\nobject, he said: “It appears to be a metallic object, or possibly a\r\nreflection of sun from a metallic object, and it is of tremendous size.\r\nI’m going to 20,000 feet.”\r\n\r\nThe other two pilots, who had seen nothing and were alarmed at flying\r\nso high without oxygen, leveled off at 15,000 feet. Mantell was then\r\nabove 22,000 feet and still climbing. In ship-to-ship conversation\r\nhe said that he would go to 25,000 feet for about ten minutes, then\r\ncome down. When all further attempts to call Mantell went unanswered,\r\nthe other pilots discontinued the search and went on to their base;\r\nalthough one returned after refueling and equipping himself with a mask\r\nand oxygen, he found nothing in the area.\r\n\r\nAt about 3:15 Mantell radioed that the object was “directly ahead of me\r\nand slightly above, and is now moving at about my speed or better. I am\r\ntrying to close in for a better look.” He did not call again. Less than\r\nan hour later searchers found the crashed plane. Mantell was dead. His\r\nshattered watch had stopped at 3:18.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of search, ground observers at Godman Field had been\r\nable to watch the UFO, gradually diminishing in size, and about 3:50 it\r\ndisappeared from view. Within a few minutes, however, observers farther\r\nsouth in Kentucky and Tennessee were reporting an unknown object in the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nA hundred rumors sprang up immediately after the tragedy: that the UFO\r\nwas a Russian missile; was a weird machine from outer space that had\r\ndeliberately or accidentally knocked the plane out of the air when it\r\ngot too close; that Captain Mantell’s body was riddled with bullets;\r\nthat the plane had completely disintegrated before striking the ground;\r\nthat the wreckage was radioactive.\r\n\r\nInvestigators rushed in to find the cause of the fatal crash and\r\nbrought confusion with them. Some facts could be quickly established.\r\nThere were no bullet wounds. The plane had not burned on impact and was\r\nnot radioactive. The left wing had come off while in the air and landed\r\n100 feet from the main crash area. Parts of the plane were scattered\r\non a line north to south within six tenths of a mile of the central\r\nwreckage. The emergency canopy lock was in place and apparently no\r\nattempt had been made to release it. The throttle was set at one fourth\r\nopen, mixture control at “Idle cut-off,” and prop control at “Full\r\nincrease r.p.m.”\r\n\r\nFrom this evidence investigators concluded that because of lack of\r\noxygen Mantell had lost consciousness at about 25,000 feet, while his\r\nplane continued to climb to about 30,000 feet; leveling off, it then\r\nbegan a gradual turn to the left because of engine torque, and went\r\ninto a spiraling dive that produced a speed and a structural stress\r\ngreater than the plane could stand--the plane was “red-lined” (Air\r\nForce jargon for the limit of safety) at 525 mph. Pilots who have\r\nflown the P-51 in combat conditions have agreed with this conclusion\r\nand have suggested that, as the plane fell, Mantell may have regained\r\nconsciousness, realized what was happening, pulled the throttle back\r\nand tried to pull back on the control, thus producing a stress so great\r\nthat the wing was torn off and the plane then fell vertically.\r\n\r\nAs an immediate result of this tragic accident, Air Force officials\r\nrecommended that all pilots be briefed again on the use of oxygen\r\nand the effects of lack of oxygen. New orders were issued; that no\r\npilot go above 12,000 feet without oxygen under any circumstances;\r\nthat no aircraft be cleared for cross-country flight unless it had\r\nbeen serviced with oxygen; that classes in the use of oxygen start\r\nimmediately for all pilots and crew members; that all aircraft be\r\nequipped with oxygen; and that all pilots carry mask, helmet, goggles,\r\nand gloves on all flights.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the crash was known. But investigators had still to solve\r\nthe problem: what was the unknown object that Mantell had been chasing?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 5._ UFO sightings in the Mantell case. The\r\nbroken line indicates the path a balloon would have followed.]\r\n\r\nAn Air Force official had announced to the press that the unknown had\r\nbeen the planet Venus. This explanation, while not impossible, was not\r\nvery probable. The position of Venus that afternoon had indeed been\r\nvery close to that of the unknown object. But with a stellar magnitude\r\nof -3.4, less than half its maximum brilliance, in the daylight sky\r\nthe planet would have been visible, if at all, only as an exceedingly\r\nsmall, bright point of light. Furthermore this answer did not fit\r\nthe pattern of sightings. The accompanying map (see Figure 5) of the\r\nOhio-Kentucky-Tennessee region illustrates the succession of events:\r\n\r\n    1:15 P.M., Maysville, Kentucky. Strange object sighted moving\r\n    west.\r\n\r\n    1:35 P.M., Owensboro and Irvington, Kentucky. Circular object\r\n    sighted, 250 to 300 feet in diameter, moving west.\r\n\r\n    Shortly before 1:45 P.M., Godman Air Force Base, Kentucky.\r\n    Circular or parachute-shaped object sighted; in view for about\r\n    two hours, slowly moving south.\r\n\r\n    4:00 P.M., Madisonville, Kentucky. Strange object; through\r\n    binoculars identified as a balloon.\r\n\r\n    4:45 P.M., Nashville, Tennessee. Strange object sighted;\r\n    through binoculars identified as a balloon.\r\n\r\n    5:00 P.M., Lockbourne Air Force Base, Columbus, Ohio. Round\r\n    glowing amber object sighted on southwest horizon in horizontal\r\n    flight; in view about twenty minutes, then disappeared below\r\n    the horizon.\r\n\r\nAll but the last observation in this series suggested a balloon flight,\r\nbut a quick check with the weather stations in the area failed to turn\r\nup any record of a routine launching. Air Force investigators knew\r\nabout the Skyhook project and could have obtained information on secret\r\nlaunchings, even though it was classified. But, since many of the\r\ninvestigators in these early days of the saucer era were more than half\r\nconvinced that the unknown had been an interplanetary vehicle, they\r\nabandoned the inquiry at this point and officially labeled the case an\r\nUnknown. Flying-saucer addicts pounced on this conclusion as proof that\r\nthe object had actually been a spaceship, that the Air Force knew it to\r\nbe a spaceship and was deliberately concealing the news from the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Probable Solution of the Mantell Case_\r\n\r\nAlthough the case remained unsolved for nearly four years, the\r\noriginal analysis of the evidence, carried out by Dr. J. Allen Hynek,\r\nscientific consultant for the Air Force, made certain facts clear\r\nfrom the beginning. The final sightings in Ohio, so inconsistent with\r\nthe general pattern of the other observations, obviously were not\r\nrelated to the reports from Kentucky and Tennessee. The object seen at\r\nColumbus had undoubtedly been the planet Venus, glowing brilliantly\r\non the sunset horizon (see _Chapter_ IV). But the object that traveled\r\nsouthwest over Kentucky and Tennessee had almost certainly not been\r\nVenus. At least two objects--balloons or other aircraft--must be\r\ninvolved. It was possible, though not probable, that the unknown\r\nover Godman Field had been the planet Venus, or it might have been\r\nstill a third object. The senior author of this book, after studying\r\nthe facts available at the time and analyzing the weather conditions\r\nprevailing that winter afternoon, suggested that the object could have\r\nbeen a “mock sun” created by ice crystals in the cirrus clouds at high\r\naltitudes[III-3, p. 22].\r\n\r\nThe final solution of these UFO mysteries often depends on one key\r\nfact. Without it, the puzzle may never be solved. With it, all the\r\npieces fall into place. The “mock sun” theory (see p. 244) remained the\r\nmost probable explanation until, some time after the Skyhook project\r\nhad been declassified, ATIC investigators discovered the key fact:\r\nAt the time of the Mantell crash, the Clinton County Air Force Base,\r\nin southern Ohio, had been a launching site for Skyhook balloons.\r\nUnfortunately records for the day of Captain Mantell’s death were not\r\navailable, and the men who had worked on the balloon project could no\r\nlonger remember whether they had launched a Skyhook on that particular\r\nday. If an unacknowledged balloon had been in the area, however, only\r\none more piece was needed to complete the puzzle: What path would the\r\nballoon have followed?\r\n\r\nThe records at Wright-Patterson Field show that the winds that\r\nafternoon would have carried a balloon over exactly the course the\r\nUFO followed: from southern Ohio west into Kentucky. It would have\r\nclimbed rapidly and at about 35,000 feet would have entered the\r\nsouthward-flowing jet stream; shifting direction, the balloon would\r\nhave traveled south at a high rate of speed, still climbing. Somewhere\r\nsouth or southwest of Godman Field it would have climbed through the\r\njet stream to enter a region of calm at about 60,000 feet; slowing\r\ndown, it would have drifted south or southeast into Tennessee. Of its\r\nfate after that we can only guess[III-4, p. 19].\r\n\r\nWithout the Skyhook records for the day in question, this solution\r\ncannot be called absolutely certain. But the chances of its being\r\ncorrect are overwhelmingly high--infinitely higher than the\r\nprobability that Mantell died while chasing a spaceship from another\r\nplanet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Radiosonde over Virginia_\r\n\r\nIn the years that followed, the pattern of sightings in the Mantell\r\ncase has often reappeared but, fortunately, without the same tragic\r\noutcome. After each Skyhook launching, a flood of UFO sightings came in\r\nto ATIC from towns that lay under the path of the balloon. The Skyhook\r\nproject sometimes was able to relocate a “lost” balloon by following\r\nnewspaper reports of flying saucers.\r\n\r\nBy the summer of 1952 the existence of giant balloons was no longer\r\nclassified information. When on June 15 an unidentified flying object\r\nappeared over several towns in Virginia and followed a course that\r\nclosely resembled that of the Mantell UFO, Air Force investigators\r\nrecognized the pattern and began looking for a balloon as the probable\r\nexplanation. The reports were as follows[III-1, p. 192]:\r\n\r\n    3:40 P.M., Unionville, Virginia. Very shiny object sighted at\r\n    high altitude.\r\n\r\n    4:20 P.M., Gordonsville, Virginia. Round, shiny object sighted\r\n    in the southeast.\r\n\r\n    4:25 P.M., airliner near Richmond, Virginia. A silver sphere\r\n    sighted at eleven o’clock high.\r\n\r\n    4:43 P.M., south of Gordonsville, Virginia. Jet pilot sighted\r\n    and tried to intercept a round, shiny sphere.\r\n\r\n    5:43 P.M., south of Gordonsville. An Air Force jet pilot\r\n    sighted and tried to intercept a shiny sphere; at 35,000 feet\r\n    the object was still above him.\r\n\r\n    7:35 P.M., Blackstone, Virginia. A round, shiny object with a\r\n    golden glow sighted, moving south.\r\n\r\n    7:59 P.M., radio station at Blackstone. Shiny object sighted.\r\n\r\n    8:00 P.M., Blackstone. Jets from Langley Air Force Base tried\r\n    to intercept object.\r\n\r\n    8:05 P.M., object disappeared.\r\n\r\nInvestigators first of all checked with officials at Lowry Air Force\r\nBase, which served as a plotting center for all Skyhook balloons, but\r\nthere were none in the East that day. Next they checked the possibility\r\nthat the UFO had been a weather balloon, but nearby weather stations\r\nreplied that none of their balloons could have been responsible for the\r\nsightings. After calling other stations within a 150-mile radius of\r\nGordonsville with negative results, investigators called the weather\r\nstation at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. A radiosonde (a small balloon\r\nattached to an instrument for taking soundings in the upper atmosphere)\r\nhad been released that afternoon, but had been lost about sixty miles\r\nsoutheast of the station when it apparently sprung a slow leak and\r\nleveled off at 60,000 feet. The weather man at Pittsburgh offered\r\nto plot its probable course as determined by the prevailing winds,\r\nand soon telephoned Dayton to report that the UFO was probably their\r\nballoon.\r\n\r\nSoutheast of Pittsburgh above 50,000 feet there was a strong current\r\nof air that fed into a stronger southerly stream flowing parallel to\r\nthe Atlantic coast, just east of the Appalachian Mountains. The balloon\r\nwould have floated along in this current like a log floating down a\r\nriver, and should have arrived in the neighborhood of Gordonsville\r\nand Blackstone in the late afternoon or early evening. The UFO had\r\nbeen sighted near Gordonsville between 4:43 and 5:43 P.M., and near\r\nBlackstone between 7:35 and 8:00 P.M. The unknown was thus clearly\r\nidentified as the lost radiosonde.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Skyhook and Pibal UFOs_\r\n\r\nThe year 1952 was a big year for experimental balloons--and for\r\nUFO sightings. Weather balloons in clusters, 100-foot Skyhooks,\r\nradiosondes, pibals (pilot balloons sent up to show the direction and\r\nspeed of the wind) were released on schedule all over the continent.\r\nLaunchings were recorded and the balloons were tracked, as far as\r\npossible, so that for any given day or area ATIC could consult a map\r\nand try to correlate the position of a known balloon with that of a\r\nreported flying saucer. When a balloon was lost, any UFO sightings\r\nit caused were not always easy to account for until--and unless--the\r\nballoon could be found again.\r\n\r\nThese spheres of gas vary in size from a few inches in diameter to some\r\ntwo hundred feet. Often they look and behave very unlike the popular\r\nconcept of a “normal” balloon, and under the right conditions they can\r\nfool even the most wary observer--particularly if he is more or less\r\nexpecting to see something strange.\r\n\r\nA man on the ground or even in a plane, watching the maneuvers of an\r\nobject some 20,000 to 100,000 feet above him, finds it impossible to\r\nmake an accurate estimate of its true height, diameter, distance, or\r\nspeed. Strong windcurrents can change the orientation of the sphere,\r\nand the particular angle of vision of the observer can make the object\r\nlook wholly unlike a balloon. It may assume the shape of a disk, a\r\nlens, a teardrop, a parachute, a sausage. Temperature inversions can\r\nproduce a double image of a balloon so that it looks like a linked\r\npair. Balloons released in pairs or clusters may seem to be traveling\r\nin formation under intelligent control. Sunlight, moonlight, or the\r\nlights of a city reflected from the surface may cause them to look\r\nwhite, gray, amber, red, silvery, or metallic. Since balloons often\r\ncarry a heavy instrument load, they may give a radar return that\r\nindicates a solid object.\r\n\r\nWhen balloons develop a leak, they may drop some distance at high\r\nspeed and then level off, as though under intelligent control. At the\r\nextreme cold of high altitudes they may burst and suddenly vanish.\r\nHigh in the sky at morning and evening twilight they may appear to be\r\nself-luminous, taking their light from the invisible sun just as our\r\nartificial satellites do. They often travel high above the air lanes,\r\nhigher than any plane can go, where varying wind streams may propel\r\nthem at great velocities, slow them until they seem to hover and be\r\nalmost stationary, abruptly change the direction of their motion so\r\nthat they reverse course, dive toward the earth, or ascend rapidly into\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nAt night all these illusions are magnified because the observer has\r\nfewer visible reference points by which to evaluate the true shape,\r\ndistance, and type of motion of these wandering spheres. They can\r\ndeceive even the most hardheaded and able pilot. The pilot is only\r\nhuman when he doubts that any balloon can fool him--until it does.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Guantánamo “Dogfight”_\r\n\r\nAn American Navy pilot, practicing night flying over the Guantánamo\r\nCity base in Cuba on the night of September 24, 1952, engaged in a\r\n“dogfight” with a balloon that exhibited all the characteristics\r\nassociated with this type of flying saucer. It seemed to take evasive\r\naction, deliberately elude the pilot, make head-on passes, and respond\r\nto every move of the plane with a countermove.\r\n\r\nThe pilot was at 4000 feet and slowly climbing when he spotted an\r\norange light approaching the city from the east at 10,000 to 15,000\r\nfeet. Realizing that the object was not a Navy plane, he tried to\r\nintercept it, but the light had started a left turn and he could get no\r\ncloser than eight to ten miles. The object appeared to be as large as\r\na Navy bomber and had a greenish tail five or six times the diameter\r\nof the light, visible only intermittently. When he reached 10,000\r\nfeet, the light was still circling left and climbing in a ten- to\r\nfifteen-mile orbit. To keep the nose of the relatively slow TBM on the\r\nlight required about 40 degrees of bank. At 12,000 feet the light was\r\nstill climbing faster than the plane; the pilot then stopped climbing\r\nand reversed from a left to a right turn. The light seemed also to\r\nreverse direction.\r\n\r\nAll attempts at interception seemed to be met by purposeful evasive\r\naction, and the object seemed to be guided by intelligence. When\r\nthe pilot followed the light to the north, it shifted to west, then\r\nsouth, at about 25,000 feet. Suddenly it began to climb at an angle\r\nof approximately 60 degrees and at a terrific rate. Although it had\r\nbeen a large bright glow, it now appeared as a very small red point\r\nwhich would have blended with the stars had it not been moving. It then\r\nstarted a rapid descent. By this time the pilot was over the base and\r\nheaded northeast to intercept the light as it descended. He described\r\nthe ensuing “dogfight”[III-2]:\r\n\r\n“The light appeared to level out rapidly, and I missed it on the first\r\nrun and started a tight port turn. As I headed for a point that would\r\ngive me a 90-degree collision course for the light, it appeared to\r\naccelerate and crossed my bow at an incredible speed. I immediately\r\nwent into a tighter turn and the next intercept was the same except\r\nthat I was almost on the light, as it flashed from starboard to port.\r\nAt this close range nothing but the light could be seen, and it was a\r\nbrilliant white, approximately fifteen feet in diameter. After each\r\nrun, the light appeared to go out one-quarter to one-half mile, and\r\nslowing in speed, continuing in a port turn. As I pulled out of the\r\nthird run the light appeared to start another rapid descent towards\r\nCaimanera. This time I went into a steep dive to follow, when the light\r\nappeared to shallow its dive and head towards the control tower. My\r\naltitude was 6000 to 8000 feet, descending at a speed of better than\r\n200 knots. The light was below me and going at more than twice my\r\nspeed. As I approached the north shore of the Bay, at approximately\r\n2000 feet descending, the light seemed to veer to port, pass over the\r\narmy dredge, steady out on an easterly heading, level out over the\r\nmangroves, slow down rapidly over the cove ... hover over the water\r\nmomentarily, and then fade from sight.” After the plane landed, harbor\r\npolice searched the area but found nothing.\r\n\r\nWhen the pilot was informed that he had been fighting a lighted weather\r\nballoon, released that night from the Naval Air Station at Guantánamo\r\nBay, he may very naturally have felt incredulous. Instead of arguing,\r\nhowever, he helped carry out an experiment. On the following night the\r\nstation released another lighted balloon, at about the same time, and\r\nthe pilot took off to try an intercept. After comparing the experience\r\nwith that of the night before, he concluded that he had indeed fought a\r\nballoon:\r\n\r\n“Many of the illusions seen on the previous night could be duplicated\r\nby maneuvering the plane appropriately. I tracked the balloon to 12,000\r\nfeet and made runs on it from as far away as ten miles. I could always\r\nintercept and pass it at any predetermined position, as against the\r\nfact that I could not get close to the other light, which at the time\r\nappeared to be moving away at each attempt at approach.”\r\n\r\nThere were other differences, too. The rate of ascent was faster on the\r\nfirst night, and the second balloon did not exhibit a tail. Discussion\r\nwith members of the Aerology Department brought out the explanation of\r\nthese differences. The first night had been clear, with a bright moon\r\nthat transformed the accompanying light into a flickering tail. On the\r\nsecond night the dew point was higher and the atmosphere was hazy so\r\nthat no tail was visible, the balloon looked smaller, and showed an\r\norange glow instead of a bright white.\r\n\r\nThe rapid climb of the first balloon could be attributed to a vertical\r\nair current, or to an air layer of variable density, or both. A\r\nballoon often develops leaks at high altitudes and then descends to an\r\nintermediate altitude where the loss of gas and the denser atmosphere\r\ncause it to hover. One wind balloon, released earlier from the same\r\nbase, had developed a leak, started spinning, covered a horizontal\r\ndistance of about a mile, and then dropped into the water. Similarly,\r\nthe first balloon probably developed a large hole and fell very rapidly\r\nfor a while until the loss of gas and the increase in atmospheric\r\npressure caused it to shrink and close the hole, slowing its descent.\r\n\r\nSome of his impressions, he decided, were the result of making tight\r\nturns at high speed: “The last fast descent could be due to the fact\r\nthat I may have cut the balloon with my prop on the third run, causing\r\nthe light to fall free. My last three-quarter turn was diving to port\r\nin a position northeast of the light, which could have produced the\r\nillusion of the light arcing across Caimanera and the Bay and settling\r\ninto the water. The light’s crossing from starboard to port could have\r\nbeen the result of my plane being in a vertical turn and the light\r\ndescending straight down instead of going horizontally. At the time of\r\nintercept I thought my wings to be almost level, the light traveling in\r\na flat circle, but due to the afore-mentioned vertigo, a pilot cannot\r\nrely on his senses to establish attitude.”\r\n\r\nThe pilot concluded: “Considering all the facts and an observation\r\nof known light on the night of the twenty-fifth, it is my opinion\r\nthat the light on the night of the twenty-fourth was a balloon, with\r\nits accompanying light, which had been released from the Naval Air\r\nStation.”[III-2]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Wallops Island UFO_\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most spectacular (and short-lived) UFO in history appeared\r\nat 6:55 P.M. E.S.T. on April 1, 1960, along the east coast. A\r\nbright-yellow streak of fire shot up from the horizon into the eastern\r\nsky and slowly changed into a huge zigzag pattern. With the streak of\r\nfire appeared a large reddish sphere, reported by some observers to\r\nbe as large as the full moon and many times brighter than a planet.\r\nVisible along the entire eastern seaboard, the brilliant object slowly\r\nmoved eastward, followed by a trail of greenish sparks. While still at\r\nhigh altitude out over the Atlantic Ocean, it suddenly vanished--as\r\nthough it had simply taken off into outer space. Switchboards\r\nin eastern cities were jammed as witnesses called newspapers,\r\nuniversities, and nearby observatories to report a comet, a fireball,\r\nor a flying saucer.\r\n\r\nNewspapers immediately printed a full explanation of this April\r\nFool’s Day apparition: a scheduled but unannounced rocket launching\r\nfrom Wallops Island, Virginia. The yellow fire was debris from the\r\nrocket, reflecting the rays of the setting sun; contrary winds in the\r\nupper atmosphere produced the zigzag form. The luminous globe was a\r\nfull-scale model of the Echo satellite--an inflated balloon 100 feet\r\nin diameter, carried aloft by the rocket. Dry powder escaping through\r\nholes in the balloon produced the greenish tail. The object had\r\n“vanished” when the balloon fell back into the earth’s shadow and was\r\nthus no longer visible.\r\n\r\nAlthough the newspapers published a full explanation within a day or\r\ntwo, some saucer enthusiasts continued to treat the apparition as a\r\nmystery. In its _Special Bulletin_ for May the National Investigations\r\nCommittee on Aerial Phenomena (see _Chapter_ XIII) included the\r\nincident under “Recent UFO Sightings.” Three months after the launching\r\nthe organization conceded (_UFO Investigator_, July-August, 1960) that\r\nthe UFO of April 1 was probably the giant balloon sent up from Wallops\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nOn August 12, 1960, the counterpart of this balloon went into orbit and\r\nbecame the satellite Echo, which is still circling the earth, shining\r\nlike a star of the first magnitude near dawn or sunset.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weather Balloons and Saucers_\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the saucer era balloons accounted for some 25 per\r\ncent of the unidentified flying objects reported to ATIC. The pattern\r\nof these sightings is unmistakable, and the identity of balloon and UFO\r\nis often certain--as certain as any evidence can be. Nevertheless many\r\nsuch identifications are resolutely rejected by the saucer enthusiasts.\r\nIt would be pointless to discuss all the UFO reports of this class, but\r\nwe can summarize a few of the most famous.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1953, a flying saucer was reported to have circled\r\naround a B-36 bomber and blinked a light as though signaling.\r\nInvestigators from ATIC determined the following facts:\r\n\r\nAt 1:13 A.M. on February 6, 1953, the pilot of a B-36 plane bound for\r\nSpokane, Washington, was near Rosalia when he sighted a round white\r\nlight below him, circling and rising at a speed estimated at 150 to\r\n200 knots as it proceeded on a southeast course. The B-36 made a sharp\r\ndescending turn toward the light, which was in view for a period of\r\nthree to five minutes, but the pilot could not identify it.\r\n\r\nAt 1 A.M., thirteen minutes before the sighting, the United States\r\nWeather Bureau station at Fairchild Air Force Base had released a\r\npibal balloon. Winds aloft at altitudes of 7000 to 10,000 feet were\r\nfrom the northwest with a speed of about fifty knots. Computations\r\nshowed that the existing winds would have carried the balloon to the\r\nsoutheast, and it would have been over Rosalia, which is 12.5 nautical\r\nmiles southeast of Fairchild Air Force Base, in about fifteen minutes.\r\nThe plane sighted the unknown near Rosalia thirteen minutes after the\r\nlaunching. The balloon carried white running lights which accounted for\r\nthe blinking described, and the circling climb of the UFO is typical of\r\na balloon’s course. Thus all the evidence supports ATIC’s conclusion\r\nthat the UFO was a weather balloon[III-2].\r\n\r\nA similar sighting had occurred near Hamilton Air Force Base,\r\nCalifornia, on the afternoon of August 3, 1952--toward the end of the\r\nsummer’s saucer scare (_Chapter_ VII)--when several pairs of saucers\r\nsupposedly engaged in dramatic duels in full view of the base. Ample\r\nevidence supports the Air Force conclusion that the UFOs were balloons.\r\nThe two objects were first seen at 4:15 P.M. Ground observers at the\r\nAir Force base, with the aid of binoculars, described them as silver\r\nin color, circular in shape, 60 to 100 feet in diameter, and traveling\r\nfrom east to west at an estimated speed of 400 to 450 miles an hour.\r\nOne object was at about 12,000 feet, the other at about 18,000 feet;\r\nas they moved to the west a distance of about fifteen miles, passing\r\nover the heads of the observers (but not circling the base), the higher\r\nobject dived to about the level of the lower, and they bobbed about\r\neach other for about an hour and a quarter. Toward the end of this\r\nperiod they were visible only intermittently because they were seen\r\nagainst the sun. Three additional pairs of objects (a total of eight)\r\ncame into view fifteen to twenty miles west of the observers and,\r\nbuffeted by the winds, appeared to carry on a dogfight; momentarily\r\nthey appeared in a “diamond” formation extending over an area of about\r\nfour miles. Since the witnesses were looking into the sun at objects\r\nfifteen or twenty miles away, they found it difficult to follow the\r\ncourse of any one for any length of time.\r\n\r\nThe objects looked like balloons, behaved like balloons, and weather\r\nballoons had been released in the area that day. Conclusion: the\r\nsaucers were weather balloons[III-2].\r\n\r\nA number of other publicized cases listed as “Unknown” were in all\r\nprobability balloons. Since a probability, however good, is not the\r\nsame as an established fact, these sightings remain in the Unknown\r\ncategory even though their actual explanation is reasonably certain.\r\nSuch a case was that near Hermanas, New Mexico, which, like that a few\r\nweeks earlier at Hamilton Air Force Base, may have been stimulated by\r\nthe 1952 saucer panic in Washington (_Chapter_ VII).\r\n\r\nOn August 24, 1952, an Air Force colonel was flying from California\r\nto Georgia in an F-84-G plane at an air speed of about 290 miles an\r\nhour. At 10:15 A.M. M.S.T., when near Hermanas, New Mexico, he observed\r\ntwo round, silvery objects about six feet in diameter some two miles\r\nnorth of him and traveling east at high speed; they showed no trail\r\nor exhaust. During the three minutes they were in view, one object\r\nsuddenly began a right turn while the second accelerated rapidly;\r\nthey changed in shape and in color, became elongated and gray, and\r\nthen disappeared. A few minutes later over El Paso, Texas, he saw two\r\nsimilar silvery objects, also traveling east. During the ten minutes\r\nthey were in view, one object seemed to climb straight up for 2000 or\r\n3000 feet, followed immediately by the second one. Assuming that the\r\nsame pair of objects was involved in both sightings, the observer\r\nconcluded that they were going much faster than any plane, and reported\r\nthe incident to ATIC.\r\n\r\nThe behavior described is typical of that of balloons. Rising into a\r\nnew wind stream, they may move rapidly and change their orientation\r\nso that they look sausage-shaped instead of round; reflecting\r\nthe sun at a different angle, they look gray rather than silver.\r\nInvestigators checked with Biggs Air Force Base, White Sands, and El\r\nPaso International Airport; both White Sands and El Paso had released\r\nweather balloons at 8:00 that morning which had traveled southeast\r\nand burst some time before the sighting at Hermanas. Since no single\r\nrecorded balloon could account for the sighting, it was listed as\r\nUnknown[III-2].\r\n\r\nThis inquiry can scarcely be called thorough. No check seems to\r\nhave been made at Holloman Air Force Base or at more distant bases\r\nwhose weather balloons might well have traveled into the area. The\r\ninvestigators apparently accepted the pilot’s assumption that the\r\nobjects in the two sightings were identical and were therefore\r\ntraveling at incredible speeds; yet there was no evidence to support\r\nthe assumption. It is far more probable that he was observing two sets\r\nof objects, not one. The estimates of size, distance, and speed are all\r\nuncertain because no fixed reference point existed. The report does not\r\nstate whether the objects seemed to be above or below the plane, and\r\ndoes not give the exact heading of the objects.\r\n\r\nThe objects looked and behaved like balloons. Another possibility is\r\nthat they were fragments from the balloons that had burst earlier. But\r\nthe explanation of this incident remains unknown because too few facts\r\nwere determined.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plastic UFOs and the “Stack of Coins”_\r\n\r\nA burst balloon has caused many a saucer scare, but the invasion of\r\nFarmington, New Mexico, on Saint Patrick’s Day 1950 was one of the\r\nmost dramatic. The “saucers” began to fly about 10:15 A.M. M.S.T., and\r\nsoon filled the air. In numbers estimated from 500 to thousands, for\r\nthe next hour the gleaming saucer-shaped objects soared over the town,\r\nmoving erratically at incredible speeds, darting in and out among\r\neach other in what one writer has called “the greatest exhibition of\r\nmagnetic flight that has ever happened in this universe.”[III-6] (See\r\n_Chapter_ IX.)\r\n\r\nThe explanation is more prosaic. A Skyhook balloon had been launched\r\nthat morning from Holloman Air Force Base near White Sands, New Mexico.\r\nNear Farmington, in the cold atmosphere at 60,000 feet the balloon had\r\nbecome brittle, burst, and disintegrated into hundreds of tiny pieces\r\nof plastic. Light as feathers, shining in the sunlight, they floated\r\nover the town and away[III-1, p. 106].\r\n\r\nA similar episode occurred on July 27, 1952, the day after the second\r\nWashington “invasion.” The dramatically named “stack of coins” sighting\r\nat Manhattan Beach, California, was reported by an aircraft engineer,\r\nformerly a Navy pilot, and was confirmed by seven other witnesses.\r\n\r\nAt 6:35 P.M. P.S.T., just before sunset, a bright silvery object\r\nappeared high in the sky, elliptical in shape and apparently solid. The\r\nsize was estimated to be about that of a dime held at arm’s length.\r\nAs the observers watched, it turned to the south and gracefully broke\r\napart into seven smaller objects, as smoothly as a stack of coins\r\nseparating. The three lead objects assumed a V position, the others\r\nfollowed in two pairs, and the whole formation then turned northeast\r\nand quickly disappeared. ATIC investigators, still buried in a mass of\r\nequally spectacular reports, could provide no solution to the mystery,\r\nand another fleet of saucers had apparently been added to the summer’s\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nImmediately concluding that the objects were from outer space,\r\nUFO-philes pondered the meaning of the incident. One author suggested\r\nthat the disks might have been seven different ships that, when first\r\nobserved, had been stacked like coins and attached to each other by\r\nsome magnetic force, so that all could be directed as one[III-5].\r\n\r\nThis sighting has remained technically an unknown chiefly because the\r\ndescriptions fail to give the necessary information. What direction\r\ndid the object come from? How long was it in sight? What balloons had\r\nbeen released in the area that day? At what time? What were the winds\r\nat high altitudes? The winds at low levels were from the west, and at\r\naltitudes from 20,000 to 50,000 feet they were from the east; but what\r\nwere they in the region above 70,000 feet, the probable location of\r\nthe object? Even without these facts, a reasonable explanation can be\r\noffered: the unknown was a radiosonde balloon that burst at a high\r\naltitude.\r\n\r\nThe sun was low on the western horizon. A balloon at a great height\r\nreflects the sun brilliantly from its rubber or plastic skin and\r\ngleams like a giant metallic sphere. These balloons usually soar to\r\n70,000 to 90,000 feet before they burst from the cold. The fragments\r\nthen disperse in an impressively uniform pattern, and may disappear\r\nquickly. The radiosonde package and attached parachute fall rapidly at\r\nsuch heights. They are not noticed by the witnesses because the chute\r\nusually does not open fully until after the package has fallen some\r\ndistance into the beginning twilight near the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nThis explanation of the “stack of coins” cannot be proved, of course,\r\nbut every detail of the incident is consistent with the behavior of a\r\nbursting balloon[III-2].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jets and Contrails_\r\n\r\nWeather balloons are not the only air-borne objects that have been\r\nmistaken for interplanetary craft. Flying saucers reported over\r\nDurango, Colorado, early in August 1952 turned out to be four T-33 Air\r\nForce jets flying at 30,000 feet, so high that no sound reached the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nA low-flying jet, enveloped in an aura of cloud made by the jet itself,\r\ncan look like a strange object. This condensation phenomenon, called\r\na contrail, occurs when areas of low pressure develop on the wing\r\nsurface; the air cools by expansion in the slowly moving boundary layer\r\nin contact with the wing. Both the depth of the boundary layer and the\r\ndrop in pressure increase with increasing air speed, but each depends\r\nvery closely on the aerodynamic qualities of the wing. An excellent\r\nphotograph of one such disk produced by a Canberra jet was taken on\r\nFebruary 4, 1956, along the coast of Africa near Accra on a morning\r\nwhen the condensation phenomenon occurred several times during air\r\nmaneuvers. The weather was fine, the sky cloudless with a few patches\r\nof haze over the sea, and visibility was more than eight miles. During\r\nthe display the air speed of the jets was usually too low or the\r\nair too dry for the aura to form. “But over the cliff edge where the\r\nsea-breeze was just beginning to break through in patches the air would\r\nbe moist enough to condense about 1½ gm. of water droplets in each\r\ncubic metre of air, quite sufficient to produce the observed effect.\r\nThe effect is increased by higher speeds at the end of a dive (when the\r\nangle of incidence of the aerofoil is least) ... but it is likely that\r\nthe patchy onset of the sea-breeze was the most important contributing\r\nfactor.”[III-7]\r\n\r\nA flying saucer reported from Johannesburg, South Africa, on April\r\n11, 1958, belongs in this category. Hundreds of witnesses reported\r\na mysterious starlike object maneuvering in the northern sky on\r\nthree successive nights at speeds in excess of 2000 miles an hour.\r\nMost observers agreed that “The Thing” could not have been any known\r\naircraft because its speed was too great; it sometimes hovered\r\nstationary in the air, and repeatedly changed color from white to red\r\nto deep scarlet. One member of an Interplanetary Club who watched it\r\nthrough binoculars described the UFO as saucer-shaped, with a rim like\r\na soup plate around the edge.\r\n\r\nMembers of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research\r\nMinitrack Station, near Johannesburg, were amused by the variety of\r\nreports on “The Thing.” The mysterious object in the night skies was\r\nin fact a South African Air Force Dakota aircraft, flying back and\r\nforth so that the Minitrack Station could test the calibration of its\r\ntracking instruments. In addition to the usual navigation lights, the\r\naircraft had carried a bright, flashing light so that it could be\r\nphotographed[III-7a].\r\n\r\nA flight of bombers refueling in mid-air at night can be a startling\r\nspectacle and more than once has been reported as a gathering of flying\r\nsaucers.\r\n\r\nSuch an incident occurred in Florida on October 31, 1955, when a disk\r\njockey at Gainesville broke into his radio program about ten o’clock in\r\nthe evening to announce that flying saucers were over the station. Many\r\nof his listeners hurried out of their houses to look at the Halloween\r\nvisitors, clearly visible in the night sky. One reporter stated that\r\nhe had seen four to six objects, oblong in shape, brilliantly glowing,\r\nred and orange, traveling soundlessly in a straight-line formation that\r\nlater changed to a V[III-8]. Both the radio station and the police\r\nstation were swamped with telephone calls from frightened citizens,\r\nmost of whom calmed down when they learned the explanation: a flight of\r\nbombers had been refueling at an altitude of 32,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Killian Case_\r\n\r\nThe most famous UFO sighting of this type is the Killian case. On the\r\nevening of February 24, 1959, an American Airlines plane was flying\r\nfrom Newark to Detroit. At about 8:45 P.M., when the plane was near\r\nBradford, Pennsylvania, the pilot, Captain Killian, noticed some\r\npuzzling lights above and to the left of his plane. There seemed to\r\nbe three, their colors changing from yellow to light orange, dimming\r\nand brightening in intensity and shifting their relative positions.\r\nAt first he supposed he was looking at the constellation Orion, for\r\nthe lights had the same configuration as the stars in Orion’s “belt,”\r\nbut when the lights changed position and he could see Orion itself in\r\naddition to the lights, he discarded his first theory. He considered\r\nthe possibility of a jet tanker refueling operation, but decided the\r\nlights were moving too slowly. He couldn’t think of any ordinary\r\nexplanation--but he had long wondered what truth there was in the idea\r\nof flying saucers and had thought there must be something to it.\r\n\r\nOver the loud speaker he remarked to the passengers that American\r\nAirlines had a special treat for them which they could see by looking\r\nout of the left windows. He continued to watch the lights as he flew\r\nwest toward Detroit, and radioed two other American Airlines planes in\r\nthe area. Learning that their pilots were also watching the unusual\r\nspectacle, he notified Air Traffic Control (ATC) in Detroit. The lights\r\nremained in view for about forty minutes, all the way to Detroit, and\r\nthe pilot lost sight of them only when he began to let down through the\r\nhaze for a landing.\r\n\r\nReporters and photographers were waiting to interview him, and next\r\nday’s Detroit _Times_ carried a banner headline, “Mystery Discs Trail\r\nPlane Here,” over a picture of Captain Killian flanked by the plane’s\r\ntwo pretty hostesses, all three smiling as they held up to the camera\r\nthree ordinary kitchen saucers[III-9]. After checking with the Detroit\r\nATC, who did not know of any scheduled refueling operation, the pilot\r\nreported his experience to officials of American Airlines, and next\r\nday returned to New York where again he was besieged by reporters\r\nand photographers. Meanwhile, following standard CIRVIS procedure\r\n(Communication Instruction for Reporting Vital Intelligence Sighting\r\nfrom Aircraft), the manager of operations of American Airlines reported\r\nthe incident to ATIC at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.\r\n\r\nIn New York the day after the sighting Captain Killian gave a telephone\r\ninterview to Radio Station WCHS, Charleston, West Virginia, describing\r\nhis experience. Following the customary procedure, intelligence\r\nofficers from Mitchell Air Force Base questioned him and filled out the\r\nusual report form[III-2]. In the radio interview and in the talk with\r\nintelligence officers Captain Killian made the same statements he had\r\nmade to American Airlines officials: he didn’t know what the lights\r\nwere, and he couldn’t tell how far away they had been because he didn’t\r\nknow their size or their altitude[III-10].\r\n\r\nNot for months had such a good flying-saucer story appeared, and the\r\nnewspapers made the most of it. Among the first to assert that the\r\nunknown lights had been flying saucers was the UFO Research Committee\r\nof Akron, Ohio (see _Chapter_ XIII). Members of the committee had\r\nreceived the news by telephone, even before Captain Killian’s plane\r\nlanded at Detroit, from the pilot of a United Airlines plane who\r\nhad watched the lights on his flight to Akron. During the days\r\nfollowing, Captain Killian’s copilot gave an interview on Long John\r\nNebel’s after-midnight radio program in New York. Captain Killian\r\nhimself described the UFOs to members of a New York UFO organization,\r\nCivilian Saucer Intelligence (CSI), and appeared on several radio\r\nand TV programs. Both saucer addicts and newsmen besieged Air Force\r\nrepresentatives, demanding an immediate explanation of the sighting.\r\nFinally, on February 28, only two days after receiving the report from\r\nAmerican Airlines, ATIC yielded to public pressure and produced a\r\ntentative theory: it was possible that the pilots might have sighted\r\nthe stars of Orion, as Captain Killian had first suggested. However,\r\nthe release added, no definite conclusion could be reached until all\r\nthe facts had been studied.\r\n\r\nPromptly rejecting the possibility that he might have been looking at\r\nOrion, Captain Killian stated in an interview with the New York _Herald\r\nTribune_, “I am sure there are people on other planets and that they\r\nhave solved the problem of space travel.... I sincerely believe that\r\ntheir vehicles are coming close to earth.”\r\n\r\nWhile the saucer believers were keeping the story alive, applauding\r\nCaptain Killian and denouncing the Air Force, the experts at ATIC had\r\nbeen collecting facts and trying to analyze them. The basic piece\r\nof evidence was Captain Killian’s own report to American Airlines,\r\nmade a few hours after the incident took place. After describing the\r\ncircumstances of the sighting, the appearance and behavior of the\r\nlights, the statement continues:\r\n\r\n“The only possible explanation other than flying saucers could be\r\na jet-tanker refueling operation. Never having witnessed refueling\r\noperations at night, I am not aware of the lighting of the jet tanker.\r\n\r\n“My air speed during this complete flight was 250 knots indicated. I\r\nalso do not know the air speed of tankers during operation if this\r\ncould be so. I contacted ATC to find out if they had any airplanes on a\r\nclearance and no three airplanes were given.\r\n\r\n“In summary, it was difficult for me to believe they were jets because\r\nof low speed and configuration. If they weren’t jets I still don’t know\r\nany more than I did before even though I watched them for forty minutes\r\nbefore. Due to the dark and strong lights I was not able to ascertain\r\nany size or shape. The altitude of the objects was 30 degrees above my\r\nhorizon. Distance away is unknown.”[III-2]\r\n\r\nAlmost equally important was the evidence of other witnesses. During\r\nthe forty-minute period of observation, the crews of five other planes,\r\nall flying west in the Pennsylvania-Ohio region, had watched the lights\r\nfor varying lengths of time. Several persons on the ground in and near\r\nAkron had seen them between 9:15 and 9:30.\r\n\r\nAir Force investigators methodically gathered the facts and made their\r\nanalysis and on March 16, only twenty days after the sighting, they\r\nreleased a summary to the press. The mysterious lights belonged to\r\nnormal terrestrial aircraft. Although ATC at Detroit had apparently\r\nnot had the information when first asked, three B-47 bombers of\r\nthe Strategic Air Command had been carrying out a night refueling\r\noperation from KC-97 tankers at the time and place reported. The tanker\r\nhas several groups of lights which, from a distance, can seem to be one\r\nor more lights, and would have looked very much like the three objects\r\ndescribed by Captain Killian. Such a refueling operation takes from\r\nabout forty minutes to more than an hour.\r\n\r\nCaptain Killian had been flying at an altitude of 8500 feet, and he had\r\ngiven the location of the unknowns as 30 degrees above his horizon;\r\nthis agreed with the position of the tankers, which were operating at\r\nan altitude of 17,000 feet. Captain Killian had been flying west at an\r\nindicated air speed of 250 knots; the refueling tankers had also been\r\nflying west at a true air speed of 230 knots (ca. 270 mph). Since the\r\ncourses of plane and tankers were roughly parallel, the tankers had\r\nremained in view and would have arrived over Akron at about 9:15, the\r\ntime that ground observers reported the lights.\r\n\r\nEverything checked. Every detail of the incident was accounted\r\nfor[III-11]. Nevertheless the solution caused an explosion in\r\nthe camps of the saucer enthusiasts, who called it, among other\r\nthings, imaginative. Forgetting that the “Orion” theory suggested\r\nimmediately after the sighting had been only tentative, UFO addicts\r\nridiculed it and asked why the experts had later offered a different\r\nexplanation--which they greeted with equal ridicule[III-12].\r\n\r\nCaptain Killian, too, had apparently forgotten his first report. On\r\nMarch 24, a month after the sighting, in an interview by the Long\r\nIsland _Daily Press_ he stated that the things he saw could not have\r\nbeen tankers; that he knew what B-47 bombers and KC-97 tankers looked\r\nlike, and how they looked in operation at night (Original statement\r\nto American Airlines: “Never having witnessed refueling operations at\r\nnight, I am not aware of the lighting of jet tankers.”) Also, he told\r\nthe _Daily Press_, the objects he saw were at least triple the size of\r\nany known tanker or bomber. (Original statement to American Airlines:\r\n“Due to the dark and strong lights I was not able to ascertain any\r\nsize or shape.”) Furthermore, he asserted, the unknowns had been far\r\ntoo fast for a tanker, and had moved at a speed of about 2000 miles an\r\nhour. (Original statement to American Airlines: “... it was difficult\r\nfor me to believe they were jets because of low speed.”)\r\n\r\nIn rejecting the Air Force explanation of this incident, flying-saucer\r\naddicts ignored several embarrassing questions: If Captain Killian\r\nactually saw interplanetary craft, how did he fail to see the earthly\r\naircraft operating at the same time and place? If the unknowns moved at\r\na speed of 2000 miles an hour, how did Captain Killian and the crews of\r\nseveral other planes, flying at less than 300 miles an hour, keep the\r\nunknowns in sight for forty minutes? In that length of time the UFOs\r\nshould have covered most of the distance to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nFew persons, given the facts by responsible officials, would persist\r\nin denying the reality of the tankers and conjuring up a fleet of\r\nflying saucers to occupy the relevant cubic area of space. To the true\r\nenthusiast, however, these refueling planes remain incontrovertible\r\nproof that spacecraft are among us.\r\n\r\n\r\n_... And Kites and Soap Bubbles_\r\n\r\nObjects need not be as large as Skyhook balloons or jets to start\r\na flying-saucer scare. Brightly illuminated advertising blimps\r\nhave caused many UFO reports. Unfamiliar circumstances or a faulty\r\nperspective can manufacture spaceships out of things as small as seeds,\r\nspider webs, scraps of paper, or toy balloons.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1947, during the first months of the saucer scare,\r\nmany such UFOs were reported. One experienced observer, formerly\r\na combat pilot, reported a flying saucer overhead at a height he\r\nestimated as 5000 feet. More careful study showed that the object\r\nwas at a height of only about 250 feet and was suspended from small\r\nballoons. Later he learned that, as a joke, some boys had launched a\r\npaper saucer carried by helium-filled toy balloons. During this same\r\nperiod when everyone was talking about flying saucers, spaceships\r\nreported over an Iowa town one night turned out to be glowing bits of\r\npaper drifting from a fireplace chimney[III-13].\r\n\r\nOn March 16, 1961, according to the British radio, a resident of East\r\nSuffolk reported to the police that he had seen a spaceship land in a\r\nnearby field. Investigators soon found the craft: a fuel tank that had\r\nfallen from a passing plane.\r\n\r\nA fleet of UFOs appeared late one afternoon in July 1961 to an observer\r\ndriving west along Highway 54 from El Paso, Texas, to Alamogordo, New\r\nMexico. It had been raining in the mountains, and wind and dust storms\r\nhad forced the driver to stop several times during his trip, but now\r\nthe sun was shining between patches of dark cloud in the western sky.\r\nDriving toward the outskirts of Alamogordo, he was startled to see a\r\nV-shaped formation of huge saucers flying directly toward him. Stopping\r\nhis car, he saw that they were glowing a deep red, were moving at high\r\nspeed, and seemed to be as high as the clouds. When they had reached\r\na point nearly overhead, they suddenly seemed to drop down toward the\r\nobserver. Rapidly revising all his first estimates of size, height,\r\nand speed, he recognized their true identity. They were merely a group\r\nof tumbleweeds that had been carried aloft in the strong winds and\r\nwere soaring past at a height of only 100 feet. Illumination from the\r\nsetting sun had produced their weird reddish glow.\r\n\r\nA spectacular flying saucer hovered near the Smithsonian\r\nsatellite-observing station in Curaçao, Netherlands Antilles, on\r\nthe night of October 17, 1961. The station crew observed it with\r\nbinoculars, by apogee telescope, and photographed it with the\r\nBaker-Nunn satellite camera. A brilliantly glowing object, it shone\r\nin the eastern sky, moving erratically and fluctuating in brightness.\r\nAfter watching it for nearly an hour and finding that the nearby\r\nairport could not observe the object, the observers concluded that it\r\nmust be less distant than it seemed, and set out by car to try to get\r\na closer look. About a mile and a half from the station they stopped,\r\nand solved the mystery. A plantation manager and his servant stood in a\r\nfield, hanging on to one end of a 1200-foot kite string. At the other\r\nend, high in the sky, soared a kite; hanging from it was a lighted\r\npressure lantern[III-14] (see Plate IIa).\r\n\r\nIn 1954 malfunction of a sewage-disposal plant in western Pennsylvania\r\nproduced one of the most spectacular saucer reports on record. An\r\noversupply of detergent, whipped by a stiff breeze, foamed into a\r\nmountainous tower of bubbles. A sudden gust of wind broke the tower\r\nand launched a colossal mass of bubbles as large as a ten-story\r\nbuilding. This brilliant, scintillating, super-giant bubble bath rose\r\nto great heights and drifted for miles. Widely reported as a UFO, this\r\napparition was merely an unusual by-product of modern technology. The\r\nUFOs photographed over Kentucky on July 7, 1947, were probably vapor\r\ntrails, a less familiar sight then than now; or they might possibly\r\nhave been the smoke trails from an exploding meteor (see Plate IIb).\r\n\r\nA saucer incident that might have become a classic Unknown occurred in\r\nDenver at 10 A.M. on a summer’s day in 1950. A man was sitting on the\r\nshady porch of his house, reading. Beyond the porch roof the sun shone\r\nbrightly. Glancing up from his book, he was startled to see a formation\r\nof perhaps a dozen spherical objects, shining iridescently, traveling\r\ntoward the distant mountains. As he watched, those in the front of the\r\nprocession seemed to vanish instantly while others appeared out of\r\nnowhere to join the parade at the rear. Measuring their size against\r\nthe mountain background, he decided they were “immense” and they moved\r\nat fantastic speed, covering the thirty or so miles to the mountains in\r\na matter of five or six seconds.\r\n\r\nToo stunned to take action, he was still numb from shock when he heard\r\na faint “Hello,” and looked up--to realize that the little girl across\r\nthe street was blowing soap bubbles. If the man had jumped up when\r\nhe first saw the objects and had rushed into the house to telephone\r\nthe nearest saucer club, he might never have found out that the\r\n“spaceships” were only bubbles[III-15].\r\n\r\n[III-1] Ruppelt, E.

Personal communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter_ IV\r\n\r\nTHE SPANGLED HEAV’NS: STARS AND PLANETS\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly before dawn on March 3, 1955, a spectacular flying saucer\r\nappeared over Alaska. The witness, a civilian scientist with the rank\r\nof Commander in the United States Navy, was returning from the North\r\nPole on the daily Air Force Ptarmigan weather flight; his mission had\r\nbeen to study the effect of the aurora on radio propagation, for the\r\nDepartment of Defense. He described his experience as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Mirage of Sirius_\r\n\r\n“We were flying southwest of Point Barrow, Alaska, not far from\r\nBering Strait, en route to Eielson Air Force Base in Fairbanks, and\r\nour course was roughly southeast. The night was clear and the stars\r\nshone brilliantly. I was looking out of the western bomb blister when\r\nsuddenly I saw a bright object shoot in at tremendous speed from the\r\nhorizon, directly toward the plane. At first I thought it was a meteor\r\nor a fireball and I instinctively ducked, but the object came to a\r\nsudden skidding stop about 300 feet away, thereafter riding along with\r\nour plane and keeping pace with our speed. I could scarcely believe my\r\neyes. The thing possessed green and red signal lights that flashed back\r\nand forth, and something that looked like a lighted propeller on the\r\ntop. Beyond question, it was a flying saucer.\r\n\r\n“I wondered if the thing might be a hallucination, brought on by\r\nfatigue. After all, we had been in the air almost seventeen hours. I\r\ncleaned my spectacles and rubbed my eyes, but the Saucer was still\r\nthere, pacing the plane and bobbing up and down as the plane itself\r\noccasionally wove or dipped. My next thought was to eliminate all\r\npossible chance that the thing was an internal reflection. I pulled my\r\nfur parka up over my head and put my face smack against the bulging\r\nsurface of the blister that formed the window. Thus shielded from all\r\ninternal illumination, I could still see the glowing object. I next\r\ndrew a pencil from my pocket and held it out at arm’s length, and was\r\nsurprised to find that the glowing disk was somewhat smaller than the\r\neraser. I made a rapid calculation and concluded that if the sphere was\r\nactually 300 feet away, as it seemed, then it was only a foot or two\r\nin diameter, not much larger than a basketball. My next thought was\r\nwhether one of the radio parachutes had somehow or other got attached\r\nto the plane by the string. These objects, brilliantly lit by an\r\nelectric light, can be quite startling. But it had been nearly half an\r\nhour since the last parachute release and the meteorologists were just\r\ngetting ready to lower another through the trap. I decided to call the\r\nmeteorologist to look at the thing. But before I could call out, as\r\nif it had read my mind the object suddenly took off at top speed and\r\ndisappeared. Now I was really concerned. In less than two seconds the\r\nUFO had vanished over the coast of Siberia, some 200 miles away. It\r\nmust have been traveling at the fantastic speed of more than 100 miles\r\na second. The Korean War was over but our relations with the Soviet\r\nUnion were still tense, and I wondered if the object might be a secret\r\nRussian missile on reconnaissance. I kept my eyes glued to the point\r\nwhere the saucer had disappeared and suddenly, a couple of minutes\r\nlater, it shot back toward the plane, more brilliant and spectacular\r\nthan the first time.\r\n\r\n“You can perhaps imagine my relief when I suddenly realized what the\r\nobject was, and at the same time realized that I had hit on the answer\r\nto a great many flying-saucer reports of a similar nature. Only someone\r\nfamiliar with the constellations could have identified the object. It\r\nwas a mirage of Sirius, the brightest star in the heavens. Actually\r\nSirius was slightly below the horizon at this time, but the bending\r\nof the light had raised the image above the horizon and had diffused\r\nthe beam into the saucerlike form. The flashing red and green lights\r\nwere common phenomena associated with star twinkling, and the apparent\r\nstructure, including the whirling propeller, resulted from distortion\r\nby the earth’s atmosphere.\r\n\r\n“But why had the image taken off the way it did, and then rushed back?\r\nThe moving plane of course was continually changing position relative\r\nto the ground features. A mountain peak on the distant horizon had\r\nbriefly come between the plane and the star, obscuring the light. The\r\nlight was not cut off all at once, however. Thus as the image dimmed\r\nit seemed to shrink, as though it were racing away. This temporary\r\nbarrier also explained the sudden stops and starts and the tremendous\r\ninstantaneous acceleration the object seemed to make at the instant it\r\nappeared. The large atmospheric lens was simply focusing the light of\r\nthe star in the general direction of the plane and thus it was centered\r\nwith my eye. That is why the object seemed to duplicate the motion of\r\nthe plane.\r\n\r\n“I watched the object for several minutes after its return. I was able\r\nto get full confirmation of this identification when the star rose over\r\nthe western horizon; it rose in the west because the southward motion\r\nof the plane more than compensated for the westward rotation of the\r\nstar. And as Sirius came up from the horizon, the ‘flying saucer’ sank\r\nback into the brilliant hemisphere of stars, where it belonged.” (The\r\nwitness in this case was the senior author of this book.)\r\n\r\nSirius has inspired many UFO reports. On December 10, 1952, at 7:15\r\nP.M. P.S.T., the pilot and radar observer of an F-94 on routine patrol\r\nduty were over the town of Odessa, Washington, at about 26,000 feet\r\nwhen they saw a large white light in the east[IV-1]. Dim reddish-white\r\nlights seemed to be coming from “windows,” and no trail or exhaust was\r\nvisible. The pilot attempted to intercept but the object performed\r\namazing feats--did a _chandelle_ in front of the plane, rushed away,\r\nstopped, and then made straight for the aircraft on a collision course\r\nat incredible speed. The pilot banked away to avoid collision, and\r\nafterward was not able to locate the object. The radar man then got\r\na brief return but soon lost contact. Although the visual and radar\r\ncontacts had not coincided, both men assumed that they referred to the\r\nsame object[IV-2, p. 65].\r\n\r\nInvestigators suggested at first that the object might have been one\r\nof the Telemuk balloons, but this idea had to be discarded and the\r\nsighting was listed as Unknown. A review of the evidence by the present\r\nauthors suggests a highly probable explanation. Above the low cloud\r\ncover at 3000 feet the night was clear and moonless. In the east,\r\nSirius was just rising over the horizon at the exact bearing of the\r\nunknown object. Atmospheric refraction would have produced exactly\r\nthe phenomenon described. The same atmospheric conditions that caused\r\nthe mirage of the star would have caused anomalous radar returns (see\r\n_Chapter_ VIII).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earth’s Distorting Atmosphere_\r\n\r\nIn everyday life we often look at familiar objects through a distorting\r\nmedium. Houses and persons seen through a pane of poor window glass\r\nlook peculiar and wrongly shaped, and images of trees and clouds\r\nreflected in a pool or a stream of rippling water may continually shift\r\nand break, but these distortions do not deceive us because we are used\r\nto them. The child who stands before the crazy mirrors in an amusement\r\npark may laugh at himself for looking so fat or so thin, so tall or so\r\nshort. Knowing that the image is only a ludicrous approximation to his\r\nreal appearance, he is able to recognize himself without difficulty.\r\nBut a stranger, placed so that he could see only the distorted image\r\nand not the person who made it could not make the necessary corrections\r\nand probably would not recognize the child if they met in the street.\r\n\r\nLike window glass, water, or mirrors, a mere layer of air can distort\r\nan image. For the astronomer, the earth’s atmosphere is a lifelong\r\nfrustration. Acting as an imperfect lens, it continually falsifies the\r\ntrue position, color, size, and shape of the heavenly bodies he tries\r\nto study. Under certain conditions it can change the image of a star\r\nor a planet into an unrecognizable stranger. When light enters the\r\natmosphere, the rays are bent or “refracted” so that the image is moved\r\nupward, somewhere above the true position of the star (see Figure 6).\r\nWhen we are admiring a sunset and think we are watching the very top\r\nrim of the sinking sun as it drops below the horizon, we are actually\r\nseeing only its projected image. The sun itself has already set, but\r\nits light is bent upward by the air that clings to the earth’s surface.\r\nThe greater the density of the air, the greater the displacement of\r\nthe image. If there were no air at the earth’s surface, the sun would\r\nvanish and darkness would come instantaneously, with no intervening\r\nperiod of twilight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 6._ Bending of light by the atmosphere. A star\r\nbelow the horizon is visible because refraction raises the image.]\r\n\r\nA star’s light does not bend uniformly, however. Light rays of\r\ndifferent wave lengths bend at different angles, so that when white\r\nlight is scattered or “dispersed” into its component colors, the blues\r\nand greens are bent more than the reds. The density and the temperature\r\nof the air also affect the beam, so that as a star’s light travels from\r\nthe thin upper atmosphere to the denser air near the earth, the colors\r\nshift constantly and the star seems to twinkle, flicker, and change in\r\ncolor and brightness.\r\n\r\nSuch changes are most noticeable when a star is low on the horizon at\r\ndawn or at dusk, so that its light reaches us only after traveling\r\nthrough miles of dense atmosphere. The sun displays these effects\r\ndramatically. At sunrise and sunset its scattered light may illuminate\r\nthe entire horizon. Clouds turn red and gold, hills and the tops of\r\nbuildings take on a ruddy glow, and the entire sky may flame. The red\r\nwave lengths remain, while most of the blues and greens have been\r\nscattered out of the beam or may appear briefly at the top of the sun’s\r\ndisk, as a “green flash,” at the instant it sinks below the horizon.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, a star or planet observed low on the horizon at sunrise or\r\nsunset may appear extraordinarily large and brilliant. It may seem to\r\nhave structure, showing an intense red glow at the bottom and bright\r\nblue at the top. Watching it, the startled observer may see the object\r\napparently in motion, hovering, pulsating, and flashing red and green\r\nlights. If he is so inclined, he can easily interpret the image as a\r\nstrange machine, the red as the glow from an exhaust, and the blue as\r\nthe illumination system of an interplanetary craft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 7._ Displacement of light image by temperature\r\ninversion.]\r\n\r\nNormally the air is warmest at the surface of the earth and steadily\r\ngets colder at greater and greater heights. Sometimes this condition\r\nis reversed, particularly in the broad deserts and prairies of the\r\nSouthwest, where the changes between the day’s heat and the night’s\r\ncold may be sudden and extreme. The ground cools off rapidly during\r\nthe night and imparts this coldness to the layer of air immediately\r\nabove. Thus the air may be warmer some distance above the ground. When\r\nsuch a “temperature inversion” occurs, light going through the air\r\nbends in a peculiar way (see Figure 7), so that the image is displaced\r\nfar more than normally. The inversion may produce fuzzy or greatly\r\ndistorted images, and when there are several layers of alternating hot\r\nand cold air, the effects may be spectacular. At the boundaries between\r\nthe layers the distortion and displacement increase greatly. A star\r\nor a planet seen through such an atmosphere may display apparently\r\nviolent motions, peculiar shapes, and fantastic color changes; light\r\nclouds drifting over the bright stars may increase this illusion of\r\nmotion[IV-3]. The rising or setting sun, although actually below the\r\nhorizon, may project upward several images of itself, one on the top of\r\nanother, to form a kind of Chinese pagoda, or a “bell pepper.” And the\r\ntwinkling top rung of the pagoda may simulate a whirling propeller.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The “Whipping Girl” of Saucerdom_\r\n\r\nThe planets are wanderers. Each day they move to a new position among\r\nthe constellations. Astronomers and navigators have learned the paths\r\nof the planets and the positions of the brightest fixed stars, but most\r\nof us, when we look up at the night sky and see a brilliant stranger\r\namong the familiar star groups, must cudgel our brains to account\r\nfor it. According to our dispositions, we may consult a newspaper or\r\ntelephone an observatory to find out the name of the intruder, or we\r\nmay conclude that the unknown is an alien spacecraft.\r\n\r\nThe planet Venus has been chased at least once by patrolmen in a squad\r\ncar, has several times caused the scrambling of jet interceptors,\r\nand has been named the culprit in so many UFO mysteries that saucer\r\nenthusiasts somewhat cynically refer to it as “the whipping girl” of\r\nsaucerdom.\r\n\r\nThe brightest of the planets and the closest to earth, Venus never\r\nmoves more than 45 degrees from the sun and thus is most often visible\r\nin our skies near sunrise or sunset, preceding or following the sun.\r\nThe apparent size of the planet varies according to its distance from\r\nthe earth and its phase. When it is farthest from the earth, the disk\r\nhas a diameter of ten seconds; at its closest, the diameter has grown\r\nsixfold, to sixty-four seconds. The human eye and the ordinary camera\r\nsee it as a brilliant white star. Being nearer the sun, Venus receives\r\nalmost twice as much light from the sun as does the earth, and when at\r\ngreatest brilliance, can be seen in the daytime sky. Viewed momentarily\r\nthrough rapidly moving cirrus clouds, it may seem to be racing across\r\nthe sky like a flying saucer, but a longer look will reveal that the\r\nobject is actually making very slow progress, like a planet[IV-4].\r\n\r\nTo the airman in the cockpit of a plane, the planet in the dawn sky\r\ncan be a breathtaking sight. As one veteran pilot has described the\r\nexperience, “Venus rose to signal me from the eastern horizon, so\r\nbrilliant and inconsistent in color, changing at once from yellow to\r\ngreen to purple and then reversing the show, that I thought for a time\r\nit was another aircraft equipped with special lighting devices. But\r\nVenus steadied in time, proving its identity.”[IV-5]\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1956 Venus stimulated an unusual amount of\r\nflying-saucer excitement. About 9:00 E.S.T. on the nights of March\r\n20, 21, and 22, dozens of persons in Cincinnati, Ohio, telephoned\r\nthe newspapers and the local headquarters of Civilian Research\r\nInterplanetary Flying Objects (CRIFO), to report an unidentified\r\nflying object that was burning “like a beacon” in the western sky. A\r\nreporter for the Cincinnati _Enquirer_ stated: “To the naked eye, the\r\nobject appeared to be an extraordinarily intense bluish white light\r\n... through binoculars, the object appeared to be a compact galaxy\r\nof lights, changing form as they revolved slowly. At one point, with\r\nbinoculars set slightly out of focus, it assumed the appearance of a\r\ndiamond brooch ringed with emeralds turning lazily on an eccentric\r\naxis.” The object was visible for nearly an hour, moved slowly to the\r\nnorthwest, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nAstronomers quickly identified the unknown as Venus. To the saucer\r\nenthusiasts, however, it appeared as a low-flying luminous object with\r\nswept-back wings, hovering in the west, making no sound, and displaying\r\ncolors that changed from red to white. While admitting that some of\r\nthe reported sightings might have been Venus, the editor of _Orbit_\r\n(the official publication of CRIFO) argued that an object that changed\r\nshape and sparkled like diamonds and emeralds could not possibly be\r\nVenus. He stated “that the public should know that out of seventeen\r\nUFO reports received for a three day period, ten were explainable as\r\nVenus but _six were not_! These stubborn six defied all conventional\r\nexplanation.”[IV-6]\r\n\r\nWhile the fate of the seventeenth UFO may require further explanation,\r\nthe flying saucer reports did not offer a real puzzle. The time, the\r\nposition, the colors, and the apparent motions of the object were\r\nentirely consistent with those expected for the planet under the\r\nprevailing atmospheric conditions. Dr. Paul Herget of the Cincinnati\r\nObservatory had easily identified the “mysterious” object. He added\r\nthat Venus would continue to get brighter and brighter until the\r\nmiddle of May, and that the number of UFOs sighted would probably\r\nincrease correspondingly.\r\n\r\nHe was right. Less than three weeks after the excitement in Cincinnati,\r\nVenus inspired one of the most notorious “Unknowns” in the history of\r\nsaucerdom, one that evoked charges of fraud, falsehood, and conspiracy\r\non a grand scale.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Ryan Case_\r\n\r\nAn American Airlines plane had just taken off on a flight from Albany\r\nto Syracuse, New York, on the night of April 8, 1956. The sky was\r\nclear with a very thin overcast. At 10:15 E.S.T., while at about 6000\r\nfeet over Schenectady, Captain Ryan and his first officer sighted\r\nan unidentified flying object and reported it to Griffis Air Force\r\nBase. Bright orange in color, it glowed ahead of the plane in the\r\nnorthwestern sky. At first it seemed to be traveling at great speed,\r\n800 to 1000 miles an hour. Then it appeared to slow down to the plane’s\r\nspeed, about 250 miles an hour, and thereafter kept a steady distance\r\nahead. The tower operators at the Albany and Watertown airports also\r\nsaw the object, as did the crews of four other plane flights, who\r\ndecided it was probably a star or a planet.\r\n\r\nThe shift supervisor on duty in the tower at Griffis Air Force Base,\r\nalerted by Captain Ryan, was able to observe the unknown through\r\nbinoculars. He described it as apparently round, larger than any star,\r\nat an estimated altitude of 3000 or 4000 feet; when first sighted it\r\nlooked white with an orange tint but after about ten minutes changed\r\nto orange with a red tint. During the twenty-three minutes he watched\r\nit, the unknown slowly descended over the horizon. Interceptors from\r\nGriffis Air Force Base were scrambled (Air Force jargon meaning to take\r\noff and pursue as quickly as possible) at 10:48 and 10:52, but returned\r\nto base without finding anything. Captain Ryan, having watched the\r\nobject during most of the flight, landed his plane at Syracuse and made\r\nthe customary report.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper accounts that followed caused a short-lived flying-saucer\r\nscare, but when officials from ATIC investigated they had no difficulty\r\nin solving the mystery. The evidence was plain and unmistakable. The\r\nobject was the planet Venus. According to the reports of Captain Ryan\r\nand the other observers in the air and on the ground, the object was\r\nlow in the northwest; estimates of its azimuth varied from 290 to 330\r\ndegrees. A plot of the planet’s actual position at 10:20 P.M., when\r\nthe UFO was first picked up by the tower operator at Griffis Air Force\r\nBase, showed that Venus was slightly above the horizon at an azimuth\r\nof 301 degrees, and that it set at 304 degrees at about 10:42 (when\r\nallowance is made for the effects of atmospheric refraction)--the time\r\nthe UFO disappeared from the view of the Griffis observers. Of the\r\nfour other commercial and military pilots who reported the object, all\r\ndescribed it as essentially stationary, and all positively identified\r\nit as Venus. In confirmation, the glowing light reappeared the\r\nfollowing night at the same time and position. The intercepting jets\r\nhad not been able to find the alleged UFO because by the time they left\r\nthe ground, around 10:50, the planet had already set[IV-1].\r\n\r\nThere the matter should have ended. The puzzle was solved, and\r\nforgotten by all but a few saucer addicts. Some twelve months later,\r\nhowever, Major Donald Keyhoe reopened the case. As the new Director of\r\nthe National Investigations Committee for Aerial Phenomena, commonly\r\nknown as NICAP (see _Chapter_ XIII), he charged the Air Force with\r\nconcealing the true facts of the incident, and himself tried to get in\r\ntouch with Captain Ryan to obtain information to support the charge.\r\nReceiving no answer to letters or telephone calls, Major Keyhoe then\r\ngave his story to certain government agencies. Using as evidence a\r\nnewspaper account[IV-7] and interpretations of Captain Ryan’s remarks\r\nin a TV interview, NICAP alleged that the object sighted on April 8,\r\n1956, had been a UFO; that the captain, on orders from Griffis Air\r\nForce Base, had abandoned his scheduled route to chase the unknown\r\ncraft, had lost it somewhere over Lake Ontario, had then turned back\r\nand landed at Syracuse and, finally, that his flight log must have been\r\nfalsified to conceal the facts of this pursuit[IV-8].\r\n\r\nThe original question, the identity of an unknown object, was all\r\nbut forgotten. In letters, telegrams, and telephone calls to various\r\nofficials of American Airlines, Congress, the Air Force, the Civil\r\nAeronautics Board, and the Civil Aviation Authority, NICAP requested\r\nan official investigation of the incident. The first requests evoked\r\nno response but continued efforts were successful. After hints of\r\npublicity and of possible senatorial interest, the beleaguered agencies\r\nat last yielded to NICAP pressure and reopened the case. Captain Ryan,\r\na reliable officer with twenty-three years’ experience as a pilot,\r\nwas subjected to official interrogation. Busy government bureaus were\r\nforced to invest further time, money, and energy to confirm facts that\r\nhad never been in doubt.\r\n\r\nTo the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), Captain Ryan replied that he had\r\nobserved an unidentified object, but that he had not altered the course\r\nof his flight. He repeated this explicit statement to officials of the\r\nCivil Aeronautics Board (CAB) and of American Airlines. Airline records\r\nprovided independent confirmation. Since the scheduled time of the\r\nflight between Albany and Syracuse had been 49 minutes, and the actual\r\ntime elapsed on the night in question had been 48 minutes, he could\r\nnot possibly have spent time in making a detour over Lake Ontario as\r\nalleged.\r\n\r\nThese declarations, according to NICAP, were worthless. They merely\r\nproved that Captain Ryan had given false answers to his questioners;\r\nthat the government agencies involved knew the answers were false; and\r\nthat a gigantic conspiracy existed to suppress the truth. Among those\r\nsuggested as possible members[IV-8] were the American Airlines Company,\r\nthe Civil Aeronautics Board, the Civil Aviation Agency, the United\r\nStates Air Force, and possibly even the Central Intelligence Agency and\r\nthe National Security Council!\r\n\r\nSaucer publications still list this sighting of Venus as an Unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Venus as a Morning Star_\r\n\r\nOne of the “best” UFOs of the year 1950 appeared when Venus performed\r\nin plain sight of the ATIC offices at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base,\r\nDayton, Ohio[IV-2, p. 103].\r\n\r\nAbout midmorning on March 8 a TWA plane, coming in to land at Dayton\r\nmunicipal airport, was circling to get into the traffic pattern when\r\nboth pilot and copilot noticed an extremely bright light hovering in\r\nthe southeast. Much brighter and larger than a star, it appeared and\r\ndisappeared in the high, thick, scattered clouds. The tower operators,\r\nwho also saw it, immediately telephoned the Ohio Air National Guard\r\nand officials at ATIC. Within minutes the UFO had attracted an audience\r\nof exceptionally well-qualified observers. Air Force experts on\r\nunidentified flying objects watched it from the ground, technicians\r\nstudied returns on the radar screens at the laboratory at Wright Field,\r\nand the pilots of two hastily scrambled F-51s tried to intercept it.\r\n\r\nThe radar operators, who reported returns from both UFO and pursuit\r\nplanes, called the pilots and vectored them in toward the target. Both\r\npilots could see the light at first, but when they had climbed to about\r\n15,000 feet they found themselves in clouds so thick that neither\r\ncould see the other plane, and the unknown was no longer visible.\r\nSince ground radar reported that the planes were getting closer to\r\nthe target, the pilots decided to continue, on instruments, but they\r\nseparated to avoid the danger of colliding with each other. In a few\r\nseconds they were deep in dense cloud. Flying conditions were far worse\r\nthan they had expected and the planes were icing up fast. Nevertheless\r\nthe pilots kept climbing until ground radar advised them that they\r\nwere almost on target. Realizing that if a solid object actually were\r\nahead of them they would hit it before they could see it, the pilots\r\nimmediately descended to below the clouds and circled, hoping for a\r\nbreak in the overcast, until ground radar reported that the target was\r\nfading fast. The planes then landed. When the clouds broke momentarily,\r\nafter about an hour, the UFO was not visible.\r\n\r\nA conference took place at ATIC that afternoon to discuss the identity\r\nof the mysterious light and the cause of the radar echoes. A check\r\nshowed that the position of the UFO had been identical with that of\r\nVenus. The light, the conference concluded, had been Venus. One pilot\r\nlater disagreed, arguing that the light had not looked to him like a\r\nplanet and that if the object had been Venus it should have appeared,\r\nbut did not, at the same time on the following day. But the weather\r\nconditions the first day would have distorted the image and made it\r\nunlike the pale light of Venus occasionally visible in the daytime. It\r\nwas not visible at all the following day because of different weather\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nThe radar returns, the investigators found, had come from the ice-laden\r\nclouds and were unrelated to the light. Both planes had encountered\r\nunexpectedly severe icing conditions which increased as they\r\napproached the center of the cloud. Radar, tracking their course during\r\nthese moments, had shown the planes approaching close to the unknown\r\ntarget. All the evidence, the radar experts agreed, indicated that the\r\nunknown target was ice[IV-1].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Venus as an Evening Star_\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1959 Venus again, this time in the evening, caused\r\nreports of flying saucers. At 6:20 P.M. on March 13, a clear evening\r\nwith visibility of about fifteen miles, an unidentified flying object\r\nwas sighted in the western sky near Duluth, Minnesota[IV-1]. Witnesses\r\ndescribed its shape as tubular or round and its color as red, orange,\r\ngreen, or white. Two interceptors of the Air Defense Command were\r\nscrambled to investigate and headed for the object at top speeds, but\r\nthey could get no closer and eventually gave up the chase and landed.\r\nMilitary personnel at ground stations and in the air observed the\r\nobject visually and picked up radar returns; it disappeared, after\r\nabout thirty minutes, by fading from sight. Although this spectacular\r\nunknown had seemed to keep pace with the aircraft, at times rushing\r\ntoward the planes on a collision course and at other times reversing\r\ndirection and racing away, all witnesses agreed that the object had\r\nremained at a magnetic bearing of approximately 300 degrees.\r\n\r\nThe radar screen at the ground station had been photographed and\r\nthe film was forwarded to ATIC at Dayton. Analysis showed that the\r\nechoes had not come from a real target but were “angels” caused by\r\ninterference (see _Chapter_ VIII). Some operators had reported sharp\r\ncontacts, others fuzzy; on some sets the target had faded suddenly,\r\non others it rushed off the scope at incredible speeds. Contact was\r\nintermittent, for short periods of from ten seconds to a minute, and\r\neach new contact gave a different position for the target.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the sighting Venus was just on the western horizon, at\r\nthe same position occupied by the unknown, and probably would have\r\nbeen invisible except for the refraction by the earth’s atmosphere.\r\nLayers of air with different temperatures had produced the apparent\r\nmotion and changes in color. The object had maintained the same size\r\nand relative position during the entire period of observation; it\r\ndisappeared by fading from sight, sinking farther below the horizon.\r\nThe following night, under similar atmospheric conditions, the object\r\nreappeared in the same position. The unknown was positively identified\r\nas Venus.\r\n\r\nVenus was again reported as a UFO on the night of October 19, 1959,\r\nin Korea. An observer reported a crescent-shaped silver object moving\r\nvery slowly toward the west. Observing it for three hours and twenty\r\nminutes through the telescope of a transit, he obtained very exact data\r\non the bearing and altitude, which provided the facts required for\r\nidentification. The object moved westward at a rate of approximately 12\r\ndegrees an hour, a rate close to the rotational velocity of the earth\r\nand the apparent rotational velocity of the stars. Venus at the time\r\noccupied exactly the same position as the object, and went below the\r\nhorizon shortly after the reported sighting[IV-1].\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rotating Lights of Japan_\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous exploits of Venus took place over Japan and\r\nKorea in December 1952 and January 1953. The resulting UFOs, publicized\r\nas “The Rotating Lights of Japan,” were automatically identified as\r\nspaceships by saucerians. Noting the similarity to the “foo balls”\r\noften seen by airmen during World War II, however, Dr. Menzel concluded\r\nthat the lights were probably a type of foo ball, “an exceptional\r\nmirage.”[IV-9, p. 96] The rotating cycle of colors suggested that\r\nthe atmosphere was acting to break up and disperse the component\r\ncolors of a luminous image, displaced from its true position. Without\r\nprecise information on the time, position, and direction of motion of\r\nthe unknown, this theory could not then be substantiated. During the\r\npreparation of this book, however, the authors were able to examine the\r\noriginal data on file at ATIC and to obtain the facts necessary for a\r\ncomplete solution.\r\n\r\nThe drama began on December 29, when UFOs were reported at many\r\npoints over northern Honshu, the main island of Japan, and continued\r\nwith similar sightings, particularly on January 9 and January 21.\r\nOn the evening of December 29 the pilot of an F-84-G plane, engaged\r\nin local-area night flying, overheard a radio-telephone conversation\r\nbetween another plane and a radar station on the ground reporting\r\nan unusual light in the western sky. Although the sky was thinly\r\novercast at 8000 to 10,000 feet, he was far above the clouds, flying\r\nin brilliant moonlight with a visibility of at least forty miles. At\r\n7:48 P.M. local time, while at 27,000 feet, he observed an unidentified\r\nobject above and almost due west of his plane. Turning off all his\r\nlights to make sure that the object was not merely a reflection of his\r\nown canopy, he climbed after the unknown and kept it in view for three\r\nminutes, then lost it briefly. He soon located it again at 35,000 feet,\r\nwhen he seemed to be level with the object and tried to close in on\r\nit. During this second sighting he observed it for about five minutes\r\nbefore the light disappeared in the west.\r\n\r\nThe pilot was a man of unusual experience, in command of a fighter\r\nescort wing, and well aware of the illusions a flyer can experience\r\nat night. He was also a remarkably accurate and resourceful observer,\r\nso that his report to Intelligence investigators is a model of exact\r\nstatement. If all such reports were similarly precise and complete,\r\nfew UFOs would remain unidentified and the civilian saucer groups\r\nwould have to disband (see _Chapter_ XIII). Carefully separating what\r\nhe observed from what he concluded, the pilot stated that the object\r\nlooked larger than the stars or any planet; he assumed that it was\r\ncircular, but could not determine the actual shape. He could not\r\ndetermine whether the object was silent or noisy because the noise of\r\nhis own motors would have prevented his hearing any sound from the\r\nunknown. The object seemed to show a cluster of lights, red, white, and\r\ngreen, which slowly rotated in a counterclockwise direction from east\r\nto west; one complete cycle of revolution required a time estimated\r\nat four to eight seconds. The shifting of the three colors during the\r\ncycle resembled the rotating colors in some jukeboxes, and the effect\r\nwas phenomenal. “As these colors rotated in the body of the object, at\r\ntimes the entire body was one solid color, either white, green, or red,\r\nbut in the process of completing a revolution the body was frequently\r\nfractionally red, white, or white-green, plus the other possible\r\ncombinations of the three colors.” Also there seemed to be three beams\r\nof white light radiating out from the main body in straight shafts\r\nwhich, unlike the colors, did not change their relative positions but\r\nremained constant at positions of roughly 11:00, 5:00, and 7:00. No\r\nphenomenon that might be an exhaust was observed. As to motion and\r\nbehavior, the object seemed to travel exactly parallel to the plane\r\nand maintained a constant distance in spite of the pilot’s attempts to\r\nintercept it at speeds of around 500 miles an hour. At no time did it\r\nexecute any maneuvers except for a gradual change of direction during\r\nthe two observations. The sighting ended when the lights vanished in\r\nthe west[IV-1]. These rotating lights were also seen by the crew of\r\nan F-94 interceptor who watched them for about forty minutes, by the\r\ncrew of a B-26 bomber who watched them for about seven minutes, and by\r\nvarious ground observers.\r\n\r\nTo make a positive identification, the investigator must know the\r\nweather conditions, the bearing of the observing aircraft, and the\r\nposition of the object. Atmospheric conditions were found to be\r\nconducive to the formation of mirages. At the time of the first\r\nsighting on December 29, the observing plane was headed slightly to the\r\neast of north; the UFO was in the west, apparently traveling north on a\r\ncourse parallel with that of the plane. After the pilot lost sight of\r\nthe object, he circled and hunted and was flying slightly east of south\r\nwhen he again picked up the object, which was still in the west.\r\n\r\nA check of the astronomical situation showed that the sun had set about\r\nthree hours before the sighting. Venus was following roughly three\r\nhours behind the sun and was extremely brilliant, with a magnitude\r\nof nearly -4.0. At 7:48 P.M., when the pilot sighted the unknown,\r\nthe planet was about 3 degrees above the western horizon. When Venus\r\nfinally sank beneath the horizon and disappeared, the “unknown” also\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThe similar UFOs reported from Japan during the same period, on January\r\n9 and January 21, 1953, were also mirages of the planet Venus. The\r\ncases of “The Rotating Lights of Japan” in the Air Force file on UFOs\r\nhave now been shifted from the category “Unknown” to the category\r\n“Solved.” In many other UFO cases of the “rotating lights” variety, the\r\nAir Force has positively identified the unknown as the planet Jupiter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_UFOs and the Opposition of Mars_\r\n\r\nVenus is not the only heavenly body to simulate a flying saucer.\r\nJupiter and even Mercury, the smallest of the planets, have inspired\r\ntheir share of UFOs. Mars, which can also be very bright, has\r\nfrequently been reported as a spaceship.\r\n\r\nOn June 21, 1952, an F-47 aircraft was on routine patrol over the\r\nAtomic Energy Commission installation at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, when at\r\n10:58 P.M. a spotter from the Ground Observer Corps informed the pilot\r\nthat a slow-moving craft was moving in the area at very high altitude.\r\nAt about the same time the pilot observed a blinking white light, of\r\nno definite shape and with no exhaust or trail, apparently making\r\npasses at him. For the next eighteen minutes the pilot tried vainly to\r\nintercept the unknown. The plane was at 15,000 feet, moving at about\r\n250 knots. As the pilot turned to meet the pass, the UFO would pull up\r\nsome 4000 to 5000 feet above the plane and then move in again. When\r\nthe plane reached 22,000 feet, the UFO appeared to make a final dive\r\nfrom 28,000 feet, pulled back up to its previous altitude, and then\r\ndisappeared. The pilot’s reaction is indicated by his answer to one of\r\nthe routine questions on the Air Force report form: “Did you stop at\r\nany time during the sighting?” His reply read: “Ha Ha!”\r\n\r\nInvestigating the incident, officials from ATIC at first suspected\r\nthat the object might have been a balloon, released as a hoax; only\r\na few weeks earlier a crank had launched a flight of balloons near\r\nOak Ridge and had been caught. But after interviewing the witnesses,\r\nthe investigators concluded that the UFO was far more probably the\r\nplanet Mars. As so often happens, however, they could not convert the\r\n“probable” into a “positive” identification because they lacked one\r\nessential fact: the bearing of the aircraft[IV-1].\r\n\r\nSome flying-saucer enthusiasts consider Mars as the probable home port\r\nof many spaceships, which allegedly visit the earth in particularly\r\nlarge numbers when Mars is in opposition--the point in its path that is\r\nnearest the earth; these ships supposedly seize the chance to hop over\r\nto earth when the distance between the two planets is at a minimum.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the Martians, if any, are more competent\r\nnavigators than the terrestrial saucerians who propose this theory.\r\nNo sensible Martian would plan a journey scheduled to land him on\r\nearth during the few weeks when the two planets are closest. Traveling\r\nbetween Mars and earth is not like jumping across a mountain stream\r\nwhere the banks remain stationary: the jumper, of course, chooses the\r\nnarrowest part of the stream and leaps across in a straight path. But\r\nin space travel both planets are moving; they travel in elliptical\r\norbits of different sizes and at different speeds. To reach earth,\r\nthe Martian, too, must get into an elliptical orbit of a size and\r\nshape that will eventually intersect the earth’s orbit. According to\r\ncalculations by terrestrial rocket experts, the path that requires\r\nthe least fuel is about 735 million miles long--some twenty times the\r\ndistance between the two planets when they are closest. To follow this\r\ncourse, which takes 260 days of travel, the Martian must leave 260 days\r\nbefore the day that his ship and the earth will converge and meet at\r\na particular position in space. Therefore he plans to blast off at a\r\ntime when earth in its orbit is 76 degrees of arc behind Mars in its\r\norbit (see Figure 8). By the time he lands on earth, the planet Mars is\r\nlagging 44 degrees of arc behind the earth[IV-10].\r\n\r\nAny increase in UFO reports that may occur when Mars is in opposition\r\nshould be attributed not to spaceships but to the heightened brilliance\r\nof the planet itself glowing in the night sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Gorman “Dogfight”_\r\n\r\nOne of the most puzzling of the classic saucer mysteries began on\r\nthe evening of October 1, 1948, when George F. Gorman, manager of a\r\nconstruction company and a lieutenant in the North Dakota Air National\r\nGuard, was returning to Fargo, N.D., from a cross-country practice\r\nflight in an F-51 fighter. About 9:00, Lieutenant Gorman called the\r\ncontrol tower at the local airport for landing instructions, and asked\r\nthe identity of a moving light that was blinking on and off in the air\r\nbelow him. Informed that a Piper Cub was coming in from the south, he\r\ncontinued to circle, and at 9:05 again called in to report that he\r\ncould see the Cub below him at about 1000 feet. He could also see an\r\nunidentified light moving rapidly at about the same altitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 8._ Orbit of spaceship. Mars_{1} and earth_{1},\r\npositions of planets when ship leaves Mars; Mars_{2} and earth_{2},\r\npositions when ship lands on earth.]\r\n\r\nThe assistant traffic controller then walked to the south window of\r\nthe tower and looked out. He could see the Cub in the air and, a\r\nlittle above it, a clear white light. The light was moving swiftly to\r\nthe north, then shifted and continued in a straight line toward the\r\nnorthwest. After watching it for several seconds, he returned to his\r\npost. A few minutes later Gorman called the tower for the third time to\r\nsay that he was going to try to close in on the unknown. The traffic\r\ncontroller then stepped to the south window of the tower. Through his\r\nbinoculars he could see a light moving rapidly over the field in a\r\nstraight line toward the northwest. It had no particular shape and was\r\nmerely a clear white light about the size of a plane’s tail lamp. After\r\na few seconds he returned and resumed communication with Gorman.\r\n\r\nThe pilot of the Cub glimpsed the light briefly as he was landing his\r\nplane. He supposed it to be the tail light of another ship going very\r\nfast in a straight line in a westerly direction, and was puzzled by\r\nthe fact that an army plane seemed to be pursuing it. After landing\r\nhe delivered some bottles of Coca-Cola to the tower operators and,\r\noverhearing the conversation between them and Gorman, stepped to the\r\nbalcony at the southeast corner of the tower to see what was happening.\r\nFrom there he could see the light going west, with the army plane after\r\nit. The light shifted briefly to the southeast but almost immediately\r\nresumed its northwest course and disappeared after a few seconds.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Gorman, meanwhile, had begun a weird “dogfight.” The UFO\r\nseemed to be at an altitude of about 1000 feet, was traveling about 250\r\nmiles an hour, and was blinking off and on. As he approached, the light\r\nbanked to the left. Gorman dived after it but could not catch up. The\r\nlight then began to climb in a rapid turn. Attempting to turn with it,\r\nGorman blacked out temporarily from the excessive speed.\r\n\r\nContinuing the chase, this time at 5000 to 7000 feet Gorman noticed\r\nthat the light was now traveling fast, apparently faster than the F-51\r\ncould go, so he began trying to cut it off in turns with his fighter\r\nat full power. As the object circled to the left, Gorman cut back to\r\nthe right for a head-on pass. When collision seemed inevitable he dived\r\nand the light seemed to pass over his canopy at a distance of about\r\n500 feet. According to the description he later gave the Air Force,\r\nthe unknown at this closest approach seemed to be a round white light,\r\nsomewhat flattened, from six to eight inches in diameter--about a\r\nquarter the apparent size of the full moon. Gorman then made a climbing\r\nturn. When he could see the light again it suddenly reversed direction\r\nand headed straight for the plane, attempting to ram. It was no longer\r\nblinking off and on but was a steady white. Just before collision it\r\npulled up and Gorman, too, pulled up. The light went straight up, with\r\nGorman following until, at 14,000 feet, his plane went into a power\r\nstall while the object circled some 2000 feet above him. As he resumed\r\nthe battle, the light seemed to retreat, then attack. Gorman dodged and\r\ncircled to the left to get in position for another intercept. Finally,\r\nwhen these maneuvers had taken him some twenty-five miles southeast of\r\nFargo, he was at 14,000 feet with the object below him at 11,000 feet.\r\nHe dived after it. The UFO turned and started a head-on pass, then\r\nbroke it off, climbed straight up, and disappeared. The time was 9:27.\r\nGorman returned to the Fargo airport and landed, convinced that some\r\nintelligence had been controlling the actions of the unknown[IV-1].\r\n\r\nWith the memory of the Mantell tragedy (p. 33) and the Chiles-Whitted\r\nsighting (see _Chapter_ V, p. 109) still fresh in mind, officials from\r\nATIC arrived at Fargo in less than twenty-four hours to investigate\r\nthis new incident [IV-2, p. 63 ff.]. They carefully questioned\r\nLieutenant Gorman and the three other witnesses, but could find no\r\nobvious explanation. No other aircraft had been in the neighborhood\r\nat the time of the sighting. The weather had been clear, visibility\r\nunlimited, with some auroral activity in the northeast. When tested\r\nwith a control group of five other F-51s that had flown during the\r\nsame period, Gorman’s plane showed no more radioactivity than did the\r\ncontrol group--the slightly higher amount shown by all planes after\r\nflight. Gorman’s report was confusing, in parts, and reconstructing\r\nthe exact sequence of maneuvers by UFO and plane proved impossible.\r\nThere were almost as many theories offered in explanation as there were\r\ninvestigators, but eventually a reasonable solution did appear.\r\n\r\nA lighted weather balloon had been released from the weather station\r\nat Fargo at 8:50, ten minutes before Lieutenant Gorman’s first call.\r\nAs observed from the station, the balloon had traveled west and then\r\nnorthwest. At 9:00 it would have been near the airport about where the\r\nunknown light was first reported. A balloon could well have accounted\r\nfor the events described in the first phases of the incident, but less\r\nwell for those in the last. Officially, however, the cause was listed\r\nas a lighted weather balloon[IV-2, p. 67]--an answer that was not\r\nentirely satisfactory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I\r\n\r\n_a._ \"Grindstone\" clouds over Mount Rainier.

VIII)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Only a Balloon?_\r\n\r\nA review of the evidence, made by the authors during the preparation of\r\nthis book, emphasized some puzzling inconsistencies. Lieutenant Gorman\r\nhad had the UFO in view for about twenty-seven minutes. During the\r\nfirst five or ten minutes it had traveled horizontally at low altitude\r\nin a fairly steady course. Then it had suddenly changed tactics, had\r\nclimbed to high altitude, turned, darted in and out, and performed both\r\nevasive and aggressive actions. The three witnesses on the ground,\r\nhowever, did not see the UFO perform _any_ of these combat maneuvers.\r\nIt had been traveling steadily north and northwest and had disappeared\r\nfrom view ten or fifteen minutes before the aerial dogfight ended.\r\n\r\nThese differences strongly suggested that two unknowns were involved in\r\nthe sighting. According to this theory, the light seen by the ground\r\nobservers was the weather balloon; the light first seen over the\r\nairfield by Gorman was also the weather balloon. His adversary during\r\nthe major part of the dogfight was a second unknown, not a physical\r\nobject but some kind of optical phenomenon, very probably a mirage\r\nof the planet Jupiter. The reconstruction based on this theory would\r\naccount for all the puzzling aspects of the case.\r\n\r\nAs first described by Lieutenant Gorman and by the three witnesses on\r\nthe ground, the light was small, bright, and clear; no structure was\r\nvisible; it made no noise and left no trail or exhaust. It was south\r\nof the control tower, was traveling horizontally west and northwest,\r\nseemingly at high speed, on a straight course, at low altitude. On\r\nthese points all the witnesses agreed.\r\n\r\nThey did not agree in their estimates of its actual distance\r\nand height--a fact that is not surprising when we consider the\r\ncircumstances. The night was clear and cloudless. It was also dark. The\r\nsun had set more than two hours earlier and there was no moonlight (new\r\nmoon on October 2). On a dark night, the height and distance (and hence\r\nthe speed) of a moving light of unknown size are notoriously difficult\r\nto estimate. According to Lieutenant Gorman, the light when he first\r\nsaw it was about 1000 feet above the ground and 1000 yards--a little\r\nmore than ½ mile--from his plane. The three men on the ground saw the\r\nUFO, for a few seconds, at different times during a period of less\r\nthan ten minutes. Like Gorman, they were experienced airmen but they\r\ndiffered from him and from each other in their estimates. According\r\nto the assistant traffic controller, the altitude and distance from\r\nthe control tower were 2000–2500 feet and 1–2 miles. According to the\r\ntraffic controller, they were 4000–5000 feet and ½ mile; according to\r\nthe Cub’s pilot, they were 5000–6000 feet and 1 mile.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the discrepancies, these estimates are in general agreement\r\nand, together with the details of the UFOs appearance, are consistent\r\nwith the description of the weather balloon that had been released at\r\n8:50, about ten or fifteen minutes before the UFO was sighted from the\r\nground. The balloon carried a small white light, moved west and then\r\nnorthwest, was at low altitude and slowly climbing, and would soon have\r\ndisappeared from the view of ground observers.\r\n\r\nThe object that Lieutenant Gorman first saw and pursued was also the\r\nballoon, climbing and turning. As it bobbed and swayed in the air\r\ncurrents it would have seemed to blink off and on, just as he reported.\r\nUnderestimating its height and distance and overestimating its velocity\r\nas did the pilot in the Cuban dogfight (p. 42), he tried to follow its\r\napparent climbing turn and, as he stated, blacked out briefly because\r\nof his excessive speed. During this interval, short as it may have\r\nbeen, he of course lost track of the object. Shortly afterward, when\r\nthe UFO passed over his canopy and he dived, he again lost sight of the\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nWhen he resumed the chase he supposed that he had located the same\r\nobject he had been following earlier--but the evidence suggests that\r\nhe had picked up a different target. The unknown was going much faster\r\nthan before, was at a much higher altitude, and shone with a steady\r\nbrilliance instead of blinking off and on. In such a tense situation\r\nhe could understandably have mistaken one strange light for another.\r\nPursuing an apparently hostile unknown, less than a year after the\r\nstill mysterious death of Mantell in a similar encounter, he might\r\njustifiably have been frightened.\r\n\r\nThe most probable source of the second light is the planet Jupiter. The\r\nsun had set at 6:24 P.M. Following some three hours behind the sun,\r\nthe planet had a magnitude of -1.7 and was thus brighter than Sirius,\r\nthe brightest star. Shortly after 9:10 when the UFO began its violent\r\nmaneuvers (the exact time is not known), Jupiter was very low in the\r\nsouthwest sky, between two and three degrees above the horizon, at\r\na bearing of about 231 degrees. The UFO was also attacking from the\r\nsouthwest, as is shown by Gorman’s tactics: in trying to cut it off in\r\ncircles to the left, he gradually moved to the southeast.\r\n\r\nThe weather bureau records for that evening, obtained from radiosonde\r\nobservations, show that temperature inversions existed both near the\r\nground and at higher altitude. Thus conditions were ideal to produce\r\na furiously twinkling planetary mirage. When a planet is close to the\r\nhorizon this twinkling, together with the defocusing action of the\r\nearth’s atmosphere, can spread out the image so that it looks huge,\r\nwith an apparent diameter as great as ten minutes of arc. Under such\r\nconditions, both the size and the intensity of the light fluctuate.\r\nWhen they diminish, the object seems to be racing away from the\r\nobserver; when they increase, it seems to be rushing directly towards\r\nhim on a collision course. The peculiar lens-like action of the\r\natmosphere makes the image seem to be, not at infinity, but only a few\r\nhundred feet away from the observer.\r\n\r\nSeen through the distorting atmospheric lens, the image of Jupiter\r\ncould have performed exactly as Gorman described: it would have\r\ndarted back and forth, seemed to attack, retreat, and carry out the\r\n“controlled” maneuvers that actually depended partly on the movement of\r\nthe plane itself. Gorman apparently assumed that he was dealing with a\r\nmaterial object (as indeed he was in the beginning), and therefore did\r\nnot consider the possibility that he was seeing merely an optical image.\r\n\r\nThe geographical situation would have helped produce the illusion.\r\nFargo lies at an elevation of about 900 feet and the land rises\r\ngradually to the west. Due west is Bismarck at 1670 feet. To the south\r\nlies a series of buttes, some of them as high as 3500 feet. Thus in the\r\nsouthwest where Jupiter was setting and where the UFO attacked from,\r\nthe buttes would repeatedly have cut off the planet from view as Gorman\r\nmaneuvered, so that the image would have seemed to race in and out and\r\nperform evasive actions, just as did the mirage of Sirius in Alaska (p.\r\n60). Since Jupiter was very low, however, the buttes served to conceal\r\nit from the observers on the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 9._ Positions of refracted image of Jupiter from\r\n9:00 to 9:29 P.M. at Fargo, North Dakota, on October 1, 1948. Azimuth\r\nmeasured north through east.]\r\n\r\nThe times involved provide the last piece of the puzzle. The dogfight\r\nended at about 9:27. The time of the geometrical setting of Jupiter\r\nwas 9:25. The usual lag due to refraction is between two and three\r\nminutes (see Figure 9). The planet therefore remained visible for about\r\ntwo minutes longer. The image actually sank below the horizon and\r\ndisappeared from view between 9:27 and 9:28, the same time that the\r\nUFO climbed straight up into the sky and disappeared. When Jupiter\r\nvanished, the unknown also vanished and did not return.\r\n\r\nAbsolute proof of this solution is of course impossible. Nevertheless,\r\nthe description of the UFO, its behavior, its direction, its time of\r\ndisappearance--all are consistent with its identification as Jupiter.\r\nThe Gorman case might reasonably be removed from the “Balloon?”\r\ncategory and listed as “Balloon plus planetary mirage.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Jupiter through a Jet Trail_\r\n\r\nVenus, Mars, and Jupiter seen under unusual conditions can mystify even\r\nthe most hardheaded witness. Unrecognized air turbulence and increased\r\nscattering of the light can easily create the illusion of a flying\r\nsaucer.\r\n\r\nAn ex-army man, a trained observer with a good knowledge of physics and\r\noptics, reports the following unnerving experience[IV-11].\r\n\r\n“On January 30, 1954, my buddy and I had been fox hunting in\r\nsouthwestern Indiana. We hunted until well after sundown and headed for\r\nthe car. As we neared it, a jet plane thundered through the darkening\r\nsky, from north to south. Placing game and guns in the car, I walked\r\naround it to see if the tires were OK. Happening to glance skyward,\r\nI let out a yell. There it was, and no mistaking it. A flying saucer\r\nblazing in the sky. A real illuminated spaceship. Only it wasn’t\r\nmoving, just hanging in the sky. Football-shaped, about as long as the\r\napparent diameter of the full moon, it showed red, yellow, and bluish\r\ngreen. [Here he sketched a football shape, glowing red knobs placed\r\nat the two ends, yellow lights girdling the middle, and yellow and\r\ngreen arcs curving between the two ends (see Figure 10).] I carry an\r\neight-power field glass when hunting and I immediately trained this on\r\nthe celestial wonder. The result was weird. It seemed to be pulsating\r\nwith a quivering, twinkling light. We watched it for some five minutes,\r\ntrying to figure out what we were seeing. Then the spaceship began\r\nto get smaller, simply reducing in size without moving. Smaller and\r\nsmaller it became and in another five minutes it suddenly contracted\r\ninto a planet--Jupiter, I believe it was. [Jupiter was in the eastern\r\nsky 50 to 60 degrees above the horizon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 10._ Witness’s sketch of Jupiter seen through a\r\njet trail.]\r\n\r\n“When we realized what we were watching we began to try to figure\r\nout the ‘why.’ Suddenly we realized we were looking directly through\r\nthe path of the plane at the planet and our best guess was that the\r\natmospheric turbulence and temperature change caused by the passage of\r\nthe jet was to blame for the strange aberration we had witnessed. And\r\nwe wondered if refraction of the golden light could cause the reds,\r\ngreens, and blues. Since neither of us uses snake-bite medicine in any\r\nform, we figured our observations were about as substantial as our\r\nfeeble scientific understanding would permit.\r\n\r\n“But anyway, I found out how people may see flying saucers and be\r\nperfectly honest in their incomplete observations. Had a person\r\ninclined to the supernatural taken a good look, jumped in his car,\r\nand headed for home at high speed, he would steadfastly have believed\r\nhe had seen a flying saucer which was evidently observing the earth\r\npreparatory to an attack from outer space.”\r\n\r\n[IV-1] Air Force Files.\r\n\r\n[IV-2] Ruppelt, E.

Many persons in Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi saw the\r\nbright flash high in the sky, followed by a trail of smoke, and heard\r\nthree violent detonations. Over the town of Sylacauga, Alabama, a\r\nnine-pound fragment of the falling meteoric body crashed through the\r\nroof of a house, bruised the left arm and hip of the unlucky resident,\r\nand came to rest on the floor. Members of the American Meteor Society\r\ncollected detailed descriptions of the event from many witnesses and\r\nadded this daylight fireball to the official list of observed meteorite\r\nfalls from which meteorites are recovered[V-1, p. 128].\r\n\r\nUFO addicts, however, apparently regarded both the meteor and its\r\nfragments as unnatural phenomena, implied some doubt that the fragment\r\nwas really a meteorite, and characterized the incident as peculiar[V-2].\r\n\r\nTo the astronomer who specializes in the study of meteors the only\r\npeculiar aspect of the episode is that saucer publications list so\r\nfew mysterious UFOs for that particular week when similar spectacular\r\nfireballs were almost a commonplace in the southeast states. On\r\nNovember 29 a meteor flew over Alabama at 5:30 P.M., and about two\r\nhours later another with a long trail soared over Florida. On November\r\n30 at 5:00 P.M., a few hours after the fall at Sylacauga, another\r\nbright fireball flashed over Alabama. Shortly before midnight the\r\nsame night a meteor flamed over North Carolina, so brilliant that its\r\ncopper-green light illuminated the interior of cars on the highway;\r\nblue-green fire shot out above the treetops, changed to magnesium\r\nwhite, and then slowly faded. Detailed observations of all these\r\nappeared in the scientific journal _Meteoritics_[V-1, p. 128].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stones from Heaven_\r\n\r\nUntil roughly a hundred and fifty years ago meteors and meteorites\r\nhad the status of cosmic orphans, unacknowledged members of the\r\nastronomical family. Few persons doubted the existence of the fixed\r\nstars, the solar planets, comets, or even of “new stars” or novae, but\r\nthey rejected a natural explanation for meteors and interpreted them\r\nas falling stars, flying dragons, or fountains of fire in the sky.\r\nMost astronomers as well as laymen laughed at the recurrent idea that\r\n“stones from heaven” could fall on the earth. Then in 1803 the French\r\nscientist J. B. Biot described an extraordinary rain of meteorites\r\nthat fell at L’Aigle on April 26[V-3]; he convinced the French Academy\r\nof Sciences that the stones had indeed pelted from the sky during the\r\ngreat meteor display. Meteoritics is thus a relatively young science.\r\nMuch remains to be learned about these cosmic visitors, but certain\r\nbasic facts have been established[V-4].\r\n\r\nMeteors enter the earth’s atmosphere continually, by day as well as by\r\nnight, and they show great variety. Some are so brilliant that they are\r\nvisible even in broad daylight. Some are so faint that even in darkness\r\nthey can be seen only through a telescope. Others, still fainter, can\r\nbe detected only by radar specially designed for this purpose. Because\r\nof the friction created when they penetrate the earth’s atmosphere,\r\nmost meteors vaporize and vanish many miles above the ground. We see\r\nthem as only bright streaks of light, quickly extinguished. If the\r\nmeteoric body is large enough, has the right chemical constitution,\r\nand enters the atmosphere at a favorable angle and velocity, some of\r\nit may survive the journey and fall to the earth as a meteorite. A\r\ndistinct odor sometimes accompanies the fall--the smell of sulphur,\r\nonions, or cyanide. About 40,000 tons of meteoritic material fall on\r\nthe earth each day, most of it in the form of fine dust. The object\r\nmay be a chunk of metal or stone the size of a pebble or a boulder, or\r\nit may be a mass weighing several tons, so enormous that it gouges out\r\na crater at the place where it hits and comes to rest far beneath the\r\nearth’s surface. Some meteors, fortunately extremely rare, apparently\r\ncan strike the earth and devastate a large area but, like the wind,\r\nleave behind no physical trace. According to present theory, members\r\nof a regular shower are probably remnants of comets, which have an\r\nicy structure, and the minute bits of frozen debris vaporize in a\r\nflash of light high in the atmosphere. Meteors that survive to reach\r\nthe earth as meteorites are thought to be fragments of asteroids, or\r\ntiny planets. Meteorites vary so widely in their physical and chemical\r\nstructure that they require a complex system of classification.\r\nNevertheless the specialist can distinguish between a meteorite and\r\nearthly rocks and stones by laboratory tests[V-5].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Meteor Streams and Showers_\r\n\r\nAny clear night displays its quota of meteors. But at certain times,\r\nwhen the earth happens to collide with a stream of cosmic debris\r\nmoving in an elliptical orbit, a shower of meteors takes place. (For\r\na list of the major night meteor streams, see TABLE I.) Most meteor\r\nstreams probably result from the breakup of comets; if the debris is\r\ndistributed uniformly in the comet’s orbit, a meteor shower occurs\r\neach time the earth crosses the orbit. For example, the Perseids,\r\nfragments of Comet 1862 III, have reappeared every August for more\r\nthan 1200 years, and the Leonids, debris of Comet Temple (1866 I),\r\nregularly return around the third week in November. Like the Taurids,\r\nanother dependable stream, the Leonids are notable for their brilliant\r\nfireballs, which have deposited some of the largest meteorites ever\r\nfound on the earth.\r\n\r\nSome regular showers produce great numbers of meteors at intervals of\r\nseveral years. For nearly a millennium, A.D. 902 to 1866, a marked\r\nincrease in the number of Leonids occurred every thirty-three years.\r\nThe display in 1833 was one of the most spectacular in history, and\r\nwitnesses said that the “stars were falling” as thick as snowflakes.\r\nBefore the scheduled major shower of 1899, however, the main stream\r\nwas deflected by passing close to the planet Jupiter and the periodic\r\nspectacle did not take place. Since then, the Leonids have been\r\nconsidered a “lost” stream, but some members of the shower have\r\ncontinued to appear each November. On November 16 and 17, 1961, they\r\nproduced an unexpectedly awesome display with many brilliant fireballs.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I\r\n\r\nMAJOR METEOR STREAMS\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-------------+--------+------------------+------------\r\n    _Name of     |  _Dates of  |_Date of|  _Parent comet_  |  _Remarks_\r\n     stream_     | occurrence_ |maximum_|                  |\r\n  ---------------+-------------+--------+------------------+------------\r\n  Quadrantids    |Jan. 1–4     |Jan. 3  |1861 I            |Observed\r\n                 |             |        |                  | longer than\r\n                 |             |        |                  | 100 years.\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  Lyrids         |April 19–23  |April 21|                  |Observed\r\n                 |             |        |                  | longer than\r\n  η Aquarids     |May 2–5      |May 4   |Halley (1835 III) | 2500 years.\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  δ Aquarids     |July 14-Aug. |July 30 |                  |\r\n                 | 19          |        |                  |\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  ι Aquarids     |July 16-Aug. |July 30 |                  |\r\n                 | 25          |        |                  |\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  Perseids       |July 29-Aug. |Aug. 12 |1862 III          |Observed\r\n                 | 17          |        |                  | more than\r\n                 |             |        |                  | 1200 years.\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  α Capricornids |Aug. 1–21    |Aug. 17 |1948 n            |\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  Cygnids        |Aug. 9–22    |Aug. 17 |                  |\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  Taurids        |Sep. 15-Dec. |Nov. 12 |Encke (1957 c)    |\r\n                 | 2           |        |                  |\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  Draconids      |Oct. 9–10    |Oct. 10 |Giacobini-Zinner  |13-year\r\n                 |             |        | (1946 V)         | period;\r\n                 |             |        |                  | great\r\n                 |             |        |                  | showers in\r\n                 |             |        |                  | 1933, 1946;\r\n                 |             |        |                  | none in\r\n                 |             |        |                  | 1959.\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  Orionids       |Oct. 18–26   |Oct. 22 |Halley (1835 III) |\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  Leonids        |Nov. 14–20   |Nov. 17 |Temple-Tuttle     |Observed\r\n                 |             |        | (1866 I)         | since\r\n                 |             |        |                  | A.D. 902.\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  Geminids       |Dec. 7–15    |Dec. 14 |                  |\r\n                 |             |        |                  |\r\n  Ursids         |Dec. 17–24   |Dec. 22 |Temple (1939 X)   |\r\n\r\nThe close approach of a comet sometimes causes a fantastic shower\r\nof “shooting stars,” and hundreds or even thousands may be counted\r\nin a single night. At the approach of the debris of Comet Biela on\r\nNovember 27, 1885, some 75,000 meteors were visible from a single\r\nplace during a period of an hour. Irregularly occurring or sporadic\r\nmeteors not associated with a known comet also occur and pelt the earth\r\nunexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Green Fireballs_\r\n\r\nOn the evening of September 18, 1954, a group of astronomers and their\r\nwives from the observatory at Sacramento Peak, New Mexico, were having\r\na picnic at the White Sands National Monument, near Alamogordo. In this\r\ngreat desert of pure white gypsum the air is extremely hot during the\r\ndaytime but cools to a pleasant warmth after sunset. Supper finished,\r\nthe picnickers had taken off shoes and stockings to wade in the soft\r\nwarm sand. By 8:30 it was dark and some of the astronomers had already\r\nleft but others (including Dr. Menzel) had lingered to watch the stars,\r\nwhich stand out sharply in the clear skies over the desert.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, far to the north, appeared an enormous green fireball. Of\r\nblinding brilliance, it was moving slowly and majestically from east to\r\nwest in a substantially horizontal path about seven degrees above the\r\nhorizon, leaving behind a luminous trail that persisted for at least\r\nfifteen minutes. At about the same time thousands of other persons on\r\nthe ground in New Mexico and Colorado, as well as the crews of several\r\nplanes in flight, were observing the fireball. It passed over a crowded\r\nfootball stadium in Santa Fe, interfered with radio and TV transmission\r\nas it appeared over Albuquerque, and over Denver turned night into day.\r\nA United Airlines pilot at about 15,000 feet near Laramie, Wyoming,\r\nsaw the blue-green ball crossing his course and for some ten minutes\r\nobserved the luminous cloud it left behind[V-6]. At almost the same\r\ninstant, the fireball was sighted in the Bay of San Francisco, 1000\r\nmiles away. One publication cited this meteor as two separate UFOs,\r\none flying over San Francisco, the other over New Mexico and the\r\nSouthwest[V-2].\r\n\r\nWhen telephone calls swamped the newspaper offices, reporters\r\ninterviewed Dr. Lincoln La Paz of the Institute of Meteoritics at the\r\nUniversity of New Mexico. Although he had not observed this particular\r\nspecimen, he had seen similar green fireballs a few years earlier and\r\nhe commented that this was no ordinary meteor but something unusual. A\r\nnew wave of UFO excitement began to sweep the country. Were mysterious\r\nmachines from outer space again patrolling New Mexico?\r\n\r\nThe astronomers who had admired the fireball at White Sands were\r\namazed at the public reaction. As professionals who had spent their\r\nlives in observing and analyzing astronomical phenomena, they agreed\r\nthat the object had been unusual in its slow movement, its color, and\r\nits brilliance. But an unusual meteor is still only a meteor, not a\r\nspaceship, and they easily recognized it as a green fireball of the\r\ntype that had appeared over the Southwest a few years earlier.\r\n\r\nThe first epidemic of green fireballs had begun in early December\r\n1948, and for nearly two months the brilliantly burning objects had\r\nappeared almost every night in the skies over New Mexico[V-7, p. 71].\r\nTheir apparent collision course startled plane crews in the air, and\r\ntheir steady, seemingly purposeful motion frightened observers on the\r\nground. The fireballs showed a family resemblance in their bright-green\r\ncolor, their great size and brilliance, their level flight path, their\r\nnoiseless disappearance, and their failure to leave material fragments\r\non the ground.\r\n\r\nNew Mexico was a particularly sensitive area, studded with military\r\nbases and research installations carrying out vital work in ballistics,\r\nguided missiles, atomic energy, and space science in general. Since the\r\nunusual meteors seemed to be concentrating on New Mexico, Air Force\r\nIntelligence had to face the question: Were the fireballs natural\r\nastronomical phenomena or were they experimental guided missiles from\r\nanother country, perhaps Russia?\r\n\r\nAfter consulting Dr. La Paz and hearing his evaluation of the evidence,\r\nthe Air Force felt growing concern. Perhaps unconsciously influenced by\r\nthe general hysteria of the past year, Dr. La Paz concluded that the\r\nobjects were not meteors but must be “something unusual” because they\r\ndiffered from “normal” meteors in their color, trajectory, velocity,\r\nsize, brilliance, and apparent lack of fragments.\r\n\r\nWith very little knowledge of meteors and great faith in machines from\r\nouter space, saucer enthusiasts reasoned that since the fireballs were\r\nnot normal meteors they must be artificial objects. Since they were\r\nartificial, they must be under intelligent control. Since they were\r\nintelligently controlled, they must be unmanned missiles or manned\r\nvehicles launched from an alien spaceship hovering hundreds of miles\r\nabove the earth whose purpose might or might not be destructive, or\r\nthey might be merely ranging devices sent as a warning to earthmen.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force was not particularly worried about interplanetary\r\nvisitors, but it was concerned with the possibility that the fireballs\r\nwere man-made vehicles, a potential danger to the country. One\r\nscientist had suggested that the Russians might have constructed a\r\nguided missile whose nose cone, the final stage in a multistage rocket,\r\nwas made of ice and various other chemicals. In re-entering the earth’s\r\natmosphere, such a cone would burn up; the vaporizing ices would\r\naccount for the green color observed, for the silent disappearance of\r\nthe object, and for the lack of material traces on the ground. Whatever\r\nthe true explanation, members of the Air Defense Command could not\r\nafford to guess; they had to know.\r\n\r\nIn mid-February 1949 they assembled at Los Alamos a conference of\r\nmilitary and intelligence officers, physicists, and astronomers, to\r\ndiscuss the problem of the green fireballs. After two days of studying\r\nthe evidence, most of the members agreed that the fireballs were\r\nmeteors of an unusual type and, as natural phenomena, not a threat to\r\nnational security. To take care of the extremely remote chance that\r\nthis conclusion might be wrong, the conference turned over the problem\r\nto the scientists at Air Force Cambridge Research Center which, in\r\nthe late summer, organized Project Twinkle to equip and establish\r\nthree cinetheodolite stations in New Mexico. Fitted with a diffraction\r\ngrating to split the spectrum into its component colors (and thus\r\nidentify the chemical elements present), the cameras were to photograph\r\nand record the altitude, size, speed, and spectrum of the luminous\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\nSince the green fireballs, meanwhile, had all but vanished from the\r\nskies, enthusiasm for the research project diminished. Only one camera\r\n(designed by Dr. Menzel) was ever put into operation and it never found\r\nanything to photograph. After two months of futile searching, the Air\r\nForce finally abandoned Project Twinkle as a waste of time.\r\n\r\nIn the years following, green fireballs occasionally appeared. An\r\nastronomer observed one over Lafayette, Colorado, at 7:45 P.M. on June\r\n4, 1950. One soared over the New England states and eastern Canada\r\non November 2, 1950, and a year later, on November 2, 1951, a plane\r\ncrew over Texas sighted another which was dramatically publicized in\r\n_Life_ magazine, and described in another publication as a missile that\r\nejected flaming balls. Few other fireballs made the headlines until the\r\none of September 18, 1954, but even that caused only brief excitement\r\nand the Air Force expressed no alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Meteors in the Records_\r\n\r\nThe American Meteor Society, whose members specialize in the study\r\nof meteors and meteorites, for years have collected reports of such\r\nphenomena. From a large enough number of good descriptions of a given\r\nmeteor, astronomers can analyze the data mathematically and determine\r\nthe meteor’s radiant--the point in the heavens from which it seems to\r\ncome. The meteor is then identified by its radiant and given an AMS\r\nnumber. For several years the data were published in _Meteoritics_, a\r\njournal issued jointly by the Meteoritical Society and the Institute of\r\nMeteoritics of the University of New Mexico. Dr. Charles P. Olivier,\r\npresident of the American Meteor Society, was a contributing editor.\r\n\r\nThe records in _Meteoritics_ for the years 1950 to 1955 list dozens\r\nof fireballs, many of them green, that were somehow overlooked by\r\nsaucer enthusiasts. On August 11, 1950, during the maximum of the\r\nPerseid shower, a blue-green fireball (AMS 2336) apparently oval- or\r\ncigar-shaped appeared over Washington, Oregon, and Idaho at 7:30 P.M.\r\nand was reported by more than 100 witnesses. So brilliant that it\r\nshowed a noticeable disk, it flew in a horizontal path, silently broke\r\ninto three pieces, and disappeared[V-8, p. 379].\r\n\r\nSeptember 20, the same year, was a big day for meteors. At 1:35 A.M.\r\na giant fireball (AMS 2326) roared over southeastern Illinois from\r\nnorth to south, leaving a luminous train visible in five states and\r\nilluminating the sky and countryside from St. Louis to Louisville and\r\nfrom Memphis to Knoxville. The final detonation, over western Kentucky,\r\nwas heard over an area 1000 miles square and shook buildings from\r\nPaducah to Memphis. Fragments showered farms over a twenty-five-mile\r\narea, struck five buildings, and penetrated one roof. About fifty\r\npounds of meteorites dropped in Murray, Calloway County, Kentucky, and\r\nare now in the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. That same night\r\nabout 10:45 P.M., fireballs were reported by plane crews flying over\r\na six-state area--Idaho, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New\r\nMexico[V-9, p. 115]. Similar fireballs that vanished without trace\r\nwere reported on September 28, 1953 (AMS 2331); October 4, 1953 (AMS\r\n2330); May 15, 1954; and October 27, 1954 (AMS 2337).\r\n\r\nThe green fireballs still appear now and then, as they always have.\r\nNone of them has yet changed into a spaceship.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fallacies about Meteors_\r\n\r\nMost flying-saucer enthusiasts still refuse to believe that the green\r\nfireballs were natural phenomena. Misinterpreting or distorting the\r\nstatements made by professional astronomers, they cite the unusual\r\nnature of these meteors as proof that they were not meteors at all but\r\nmachines from another world. Advocates of this belief need more than\r\na refresher course in logic; they also need to learn some facts about\r\nmeteors.\r\n\r\nThe space-vehicle interpretation rests on a series of mistaken beliefs\r\nand illogical conclusions about the nature and behavior of meteors.\r\nThese false premises may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Color._ Meteors do not contain copper; since the peculiar shade of\r\ngreen shown by the green fireballs could come only from copper, the\r\nfireballs were not meteors but spacecraft.\r\n\r\n2. _Speed and trajectory._ Meteors do not travel at a slow rate of\r\nspeed and do not follow a horizontal path; since the green fireballs\r\ndid both, they were not meteors but spacecraft.\r\n\r\n3. _Size and brilliance._ Meteors do not show such great size or\r\nbrilliance as did the green fireballs, which were therefore not meteors\r\nbut spacecraft.\r\n\r\n4. _Sound._ Meteors produce a loud noise; since the green fireballs\r\nmoved silently, they were not meteors but spacecraft.\r\n\r\n5. _Fragments._ Meteors deposit material fragments on the earth which\r\ncan be located if the investigator maps the flight path and makes a\r\nsearch; since the green fireballs left no fragments, they were not\r\nmeteors but spacecraft.\r\n\r\nIn the pages that follow we shall attempt to correct each of these\r\nmistaken ideas in turn, to present the actual facts known to\r\nastronomers, and to show clearly that the green fireballs were not\r\nspacecraft, but meteors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Facts about Meteors_\r\n\r\n1. _Color._ Copper-green meteors are not a new phenomenon. This\r\nunusual shade of green is only one of the many possible colors that\r\nmeteors may display--white, green, blue, yellow, orange, red, and all\r\nshades in between. Descriptions received by the Meteoritical Society\r\ninclude adjectives such as bright-green, copper-green, blue-green,\r\nfiery white, green-white, orange, blue, yellowish, silver, red-orange.\r\nPerceptions of color vary greatly among different observers, so that\r\nseveral witnesses may choose different words for the color of the same\r\nobject. The most common adjective used is “brilliant”; an observer who\r\nhas only a few seconds to look at the object often has real difficulty\r\nin deciding just what color accompanied the brilliance. Very common\r\nphrases are blue-green, greenish-white, orange-yellow, orange-red,\r\ngreenish-yellow, yellow-green.\r\n\r\nBoth the chemical structure and the velocity of the meteoric body help\r\ndetermine its apparent color. As the burning object plunges through the\r\natmosphere and vaporizes, the chemical elements produce their typical\r\ncolors. At higher velocities, atmospheric friction heats the body to\r\nhigher temperatures and whitens the color; as the body slows down and\r\nbecomes less hot, it is apt to appear redder.\r\n\r\nIn a few instances astronomers have been able to photograph the\r\ncolor spectrum of a meteor in flight, to analyze the spectral lines\r\nand determine exactly what elements were present[V-10]. As a rule,\r\nhowever, the chemical content must be found from a laboratory analysis\r\nof recovered meteorites. Some meteors do contain traces of copper,\r\nand free nodules of pure copper have been found in several meteorites\r\n[V-5, p. 81]. Magnesium occurs in fairly high percentages in most\r\nmeteorites and the amount is unusually high in green meteors[V-11].\r\nIt produces a color almost identical with that from copper. Seeing\r\nthe green of a vaporizing meteor, no observer could tell whether the\r\ncolor came from copper or from magnesium unless he could photograph the\r\nspectrum or make a chemical analysis of the meteorite.\r\n\r\nThe color displayed by the New Mexico fireballs may have come from\r\ncopper, but more probably from magnesium. Another possible source\r\nis frozen nitrogen. Laboratory experiments relating to problems\r\nof satellite re-entry[V-12] have shown that when frozen nitrogen\r\nvaporizes, it emits a brilliant green glow whose wave length is\r\nalmost identical with that of the New Mexico fireballs, as judged\r\nfrom the paintings made by witnesses. One of the prevailing theories\r\nsuggests that meteors of this type may be icy “cometoids”--cometary\r\ndebris, chunks of ice, and frozen gases (including nitrogen) at very\r\nlow temperatures. When they enter the earth’s atmosphere and are\r\nslowed down to speeds of several hundred miles an hour, they become\r\nheated and vaporize, and the surface alternately melts and refreezes;\r\nthe vaporizing nitrogen would produce the green color seen in the\r\nfireballs. Such a process would account for the color, the short\r\nlifetime, and the lack of fragments of the New Mexico meteors.\r\n\r\nTo summarize: Meteors _can_ exhibit the particular green color shown\r\nby the New Mexico fireballs. It can result from copper, magnesium, or\r\nfrozen nitrogen, which can normally occur in meteors.\r\n\r\n2. _Speed and trajectory._ Meteors vary widely in their velocities\r\nand flight paths. They plunge from space into the earth’s atmosphere\r\nat speeds estimated to range from seven to forty-five miles a second\r\nrelative to the earth--from 25,000 to more than 150,000 miles per hour.\r\nMembers of a particular meteor stream usually show a characteristic\r\nvelocity. The Perseids, for example, travel at high speed, some\r\nthirty-six miles a second, while the Geminids saunter in at a mere\r\ntwenty-one miles a second. Most of these “falling stars” become\r\nvisible to us when they have descended to around sixty or seventy miles\r\nabove the earth. Flashing down in a steep path, they usually burn\r\nup and vanish by the time they have fallen to around fifty or forty\r\nmiles. The larger the meteor’s body, the longer its life and the lower\r\nits point of disappearance. Most meteors maintain a straight course\r\nas they descend toward earth. A typical path is that photographed by\r\nSmithsonian astronomers in New Mexico on the night of November 23, 1960\r\n(see Plate IIIa). Some fireballs have been reported to change course\r\nafter exploding. More probably, the witness is actually observing the\r\nshifting pattern of the smoke cloud left by the meteor. The Puerto Rico\r\nfireball of January 12, 1947, left an erratic trail of this type, which\r\nwas photographed ten to twenty minutes after the meteor had disappeared\r\n(see Plate IIIb).\r\n\r\nThe original entrance velocity, angle of entry, size, and chemical\r\nstructure all influence the shape of a meteor’s path and its time of\r\nsurvival. The apparent angle of descent as seen by the observer depends\r\non the distance and the direction the object is moving relative to the\r\nobserver. When the meteor travels parallel to the observer’s line of\r\nsight, it seems much slower than when it passes the line of sight at\r\nright angles. The greater the distance between the observer and the\r\nmeteor, the slower its apparent motion[V-13].\r\n\r\nSome meteors move very slowly; traveling at an almost leisurely rate,\r\nthey soar through the sky on a long, level path almost parallel with\r\nthe earth. The slow fireballs in the great meteor procession of 1913\r\nmaintained a horizontal course over a distance of several thousand\r\nmiles, from western Canada to Brazil[V-14].\r\n\r\nAstronomical records show that green meteors are usually slow. Some\r\n230 persons reported to the American Meteor Society that on November\r\n28, 1953, at 6:30 P.M., a fireball moved slowly through the sky from\r\nMassachusetts to Pennsylvania. Described as blue-white-green, changing\r\nto orange-yellow-red, it was huge, disk-shaped, and vanished silently\r\nwithout depositing fragments [V-1, p. 273]. On May 15, 1954, at 11:22\r\nP.M., more than 100 persons observed (and reported) a slow-moving\r\nfireball, blue-green changing to red, of luminosity so great that it\r\nwoke sleeping people. Toward the end of its course it seemed to stop,\r\nspiraled a couple of times, and then simply vanished without leaving\r\nfragments [V-8, p. 336].\r\n\r\nTo summarize: Meteors _can_ travel at low velocities and in apparently\r\nhorizontal paths.\r\n\r\n3. _Size and brilliance._ Giant meteors of great luminosity have been\r\nrecorded throughout history. Some fireballs have been visible to\r\nobservers throughout an area of thousands of square miles. Typical\r\ndescriptions are: dazzling, like an airplane falling in flames, bigger\r\nthan the full moon, of blinding brilliance, so bright it turned night\r\ninto day, like the headlight of a locomotive, as big as the setting sun\r\nbut three times as brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe luminosity does not depend on the actual size of the meteoric body.\r\nA fragment no larger than a pinhead can create a brilliant flash as\r\nit vanishes. A spectacular fireball that lights up the country over\r\nhundreds of miles may have a small body that burns up completely miles\r\nabove the earth. A larger body can survive longer, so that it continues\r\nto flare for several seconds or more. The larger, long-lasting\r\nfireballs may explode into smaller fragments and cascades of sparks. In\r\nexploding, they can produce a luminous cloud of particles that remains\r\nvisible for fifteen or twenty minutes and then peppers the ground\r\nwith meteorites that fall like hail or buckshot. A giant fireball can\r\ndeposit chunks of metal weighing a ton or more like those found in\r\nMexico, or can leave a truly enormous body that penetrates the ground\r\nand carves out a great crater like those in Arizona and Texas.\r\n\r\nTo summarize: Huge fireballs of great brilliance are not new.\r\n\r\n4. _Sound._ Some meteors produce noise; others do not. Most meteors\r\nsilently vaporize high above the earth. When one does reach the\r\nground, it may strike with no noise but the faint thud of its impact.\r\nShooting through the air, it sometimes makes weak noises that have been\r\ndescribed as rumbling, crackling, rustling, whistling, or hissing.\r\n\r\nMeteors sometimes explode with one or more crashing detonations that\r\nrattle or even break windows. The noise has been described as like a\r\nheavy clap of thunder, the explosion of a volcano, or a whir as if a\r\nmillion bumblebees had been disturbed. The noise from the explosion of\r\nthe Siberian meteor in 1908 was heard over a distance of 600 miles, and\r\nthe shock registered as an earthquake in England.\r\n\r\nMany meteors, like the Pennsylvania fireball of January 29, 1952, (AMS\r\n2328) are completely silent. This blue-green object, so large that it\r\nshowed a definite disk, was reported to the American Meteor Society by\r\nmore than 400 witnesses from Maine to Virginia and from New York to\r\nOhio; none of the observers heard any noise [V-1, p. 264].\r\n\r\nTo summarize: Some meteors end with a bang, but most of them don’t even\r\nwhimper.\r\n\r\n5. _Fragments._ Most meteors burn up high in the atmosphere. A few, if\r\nthey are large enough in size (at least ten to twenty pounds) and tough\r\nenough in structure, survive to reach the earth as stony or metallic\r\nfragments. Marked differences characterize the various meteor streams.\r\nThe Taurids (maximum November 12) are relatively rigid structures,\r\nunusually tough, and show little tendency to break up in their flight.\r\nThe many Taurid fireballs show that fairly large bodies have survived.\r\nThe Geminids (maximum December 14) are of average strength but appear\r\nto be very dense, while the Draconids (October 10) are featherlike and\r\nfragile, with low density. Some of the most brilliant fireballs may be\r\nstructures of ice and frozen gases which quickly vaporize on reaching\r\nthe earth and hence leave no detectable fragments. The fiery object\r\nthat struck Siberia in 1908 may have been such an “icy cometoid”;\r\nalthough it devastated an area of hundreds of square miles and uprooted\r\nor knocked down some eighty million trees, it apparently left no\r\nphysical trace[V-15].\r\n\r\nIf some of the physical body does survive to reach the earth’s surface,\r\nfinding it is still a problem. Recovery is rare even when the fall\r\noccurs in daylight over well-populated country and the flight path\r\ncan be charted from the accounts of reliable witnesses. When the\r\nfall occurs at night, recovery is even rarer[V-5]. After dark, even\r\nexperienced observers find it difficult to judge true directions and\r\ndistances, and they may plot a place of fall that is many miles from\r\nthe actual point of impact. Meteoriticists know that there is small\r\nchance of finding meteorites that fall at night except in regions where\r\nmost of the land is under cultivation. In the fifty years between 1898\r\nand 1948, of forty-eight recoveries from observed meteorite falls in\r\nthe United States, only seven were made from falls occurring after 8\r\nP.M.[V-5].\r\n\r\nRecovery depends on many factors: the number of persons who saw the\r\nevent, the accuracy of their estimates of distance and direction, the\r\nsize of the meteorites, the patience of the searchers, the time and\r\nmoney available for the search, and, most important of all, just plain\r\nluck.\r\n\r\nThe Norton County fall of February 18, 1948, illustrates both the\r\ndetective work and the luck required. At about 4:56 P.M. C.S.T. a\r\nbrilliant detonating fireball soared over an area including Kansas,\r\nNebraska, Colorado, Oklahoma, and Texas, and left a large white cloud\r\nthat was visible for about an hour afterward. Newspapers publicized\r\nthe phenomenon as a flying saucer and a few excited witnesses agreed.\r\nOne man affirmed that shortly before the explosion the strange craft\r\nhovered over his yard at eye level, belching fire and showering sparks,\r\nthen suddenly took off, climbing fast, and exploded.\r\n\r\nMeteoriticists at once recognized the characteristic pattern of an\r\nexploding meteor and determined to find the remains. From newspaper\r\nreports and personal interviews with the witnesses, H. H. Nininger\r\nof the American Meteorite Museum in Arizona plotted the path and\r\ndetermined that the probable point of explosion was thirteen miles\r\nwest and three miles north of Norton, Kansas[V-16]. From similar\r\ninvestigations, Lincoln La Paz of the Institute of Meteoritics in\r\nNew Mexico determined the probable place of impact as an area eight\r\nmiles long and four miles wide, about thirty-two square miles, on the\r\nKansas-Nebraska line.\r\n\r\nDuring the Easter vacation a field-survey party from New Mexico\r\ndrove north into Kansas to hunt for the meteorite, but blizzards and\r\nsnow-blocked roads stopped the work. A second search, begun on April\r\n27, suggested that the main mass of the meteorite must have fallen\r\nsomewhere in Furnas County, Nebraska. When persistent hunting failed to\r\nreveal it, the searchers moved south into Kansas, where a farmer had\r\nfound a strange stone that smelled of sulphur and contained metallic\r\nspecks. Although many stony meteorites of various weights turned up in\r\nthis area, the main mass remained hidden until July 3 when a farmer\r\nlocated it, by accident, in a field that the official party had already\r\nexamined and abandoned some three months earlier. This meteorite,\r\nalthough it weighed more than a ton and had dug out a six-foot crater\r\nin the ground, had eluded the hunters because “at the time of the fall\r\nthe only dwelling close to the point of impact was unoccupied and ...\r\nthe impact occurred in a field so overgrown with weeds and stubble that\r\neven the large crater made by the record-breaking main mass of the fall\r\nwas finally located only when by chance a caterpillar tractor started\r\nto fall into it.”[V-17]\r\n\r\nTo find these meteorites, several highly trained searchers had spent\r\ndays of effort, made a number of field surveys, driven more than 10,000\r\nmiles, and interviewed hundreds of persons who observed the flight\r\nof the fireball. Even so, they counted themselves lucky because many\r\n“meteorites of such composition and structure, although large enough to\r\nproduce spectacular light and sound effects in the intermediate layers\r\nof the atmosphere, might disintegrate so completely during transit\r\nthrough the denser lower atmosphere that only dust would survive to\r\nreach the earth.”\r\n\r\nThe green fireballs of New Mexico were silent; they were probably icy\r\nstructures and hence produced no meteorites. Even if they had, locating\r\nthe place of fall would have been nearly impossible because the meteors\r\nappeared at night in a sparsely populated area.\r\n\r\nTo summarize: Many meteors do not leave fragments. Even when they do,\r\nfinding the meteorite requires luck as well as hard work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unusual Fireballs_\r\n\r\nThe officers and crewmen of a plane in flight have a front-row seat at\r\nthe drama of the heavens, where astronomical events seem doubly vivid\r\nagainst the dark night sky. The pilot has been trained to recognize\r\nthe major constellations, the brightest stars, and ordinary phenomena\r\nsuch as meteors and the Aurora Borealis. As a rule, however, he limits\r\nhis study to the needs of the job. The few who have an astronomer’s\r\nintimate acquaintance with the heavens have often made valuable\r\ncontributions to our knowledge. Comet 1957d was first observed by\r\nan airman and Comet 1948l was discovered by a pilot flying from the\r\nFiji Islands to Australia. Comet Wilson, discovered on July 23, 1961\r\n(and reported to the Air Force by some persons as a UFO), was first\r\nrecognized by A. Stewart Wilson, navigator on a Pan American flight\r\nover the Pacific. All members of the crew were skilled and experienced\r\nfliers, but he alone was equipped to see the significance of the\r\nintruder in the constellation Gemini[V-18].\r\n\r\nOne of the most fantastic apparitions to confront a pilot is a group of\r\nluminous objects flaming through the air in more or less geometrical\r\nformation. The objects often seem to be heading directly toward the\r\nplane on a collision course but, as though under intelligent control,\r\nseem to veer off at the last possible instant and then disappear\r\nat incredible speed. The pilot usually recognizes this frightening\r\nphenomenon as an exploding meteor or a cluster of fireballs.\r\nOccasionally the sight is so extraordinary that he insists it could\r\nnot have been a mere meteor but must have been some weird spacecraft.\r\nAirmen of unquestioned competence have made this mistake, sometimes\r\nbecause they more than half believed in extraterrestrial visitors, but\r\nmore often because they knew less than they supposed about meteors.\r\n\r\nIn trying to identify the alarming objects approaching his plane, the\r\npilot often thinks first of a meteor, then rejects the idea with some\r\nform of the remark, “Whatever it was, it was certainly not a meteor;\r\nI’ve seen meteors and I can’t be fooled.” He usually adds that no\r\nmeteor could travel so fast (or so slowly) as the one he saw; so high\r\n(or so low); could have such a color; steer so “obvious” a collision\r\ncourse; fly as part of so orderly a group; move in so level (or so\r\nsteeply angled) a path; maintain so steady a course; change course so\r\nabruptly; move so silently; or create so loud a detonation.\r\n\r\nSuch an incident occurred on a Pan American flight from New York to\r\nSan Juan early on the morning of March 9, 1957. At about 3:30 A.M.\r\nwhen the plane was off Jacksonville, Florida, the pilot and the flight\r\nengineer saw a burning, greenish-white, round object coming out of\r\nnowhere, seemingly only a half mile away and headed across their nose\r\non a direct collision course[V-19]. In such a situation a plane’s\r\ncaptain cannot waste time in analyzing what he sees, but must act. In\r\na violent evasive move he put the plane into a climb of about 1500\r\nfeet, during which several passengers were thrown out of their seats\r\nand injured. At the same moment the crews of at least seven other\r\nflights within an area of 300 miles were reporting the same object.\r\nOne witness saw it split in two and the fiery rear section drop away.\r\nAbout an hour earlier, the pilot of another plane in the area had seen\r\nthe breakup of a similar meteor but had not reported it. In spite of\r\nall the evidence that the unknown was a normal meteor, breaking apart\r\nas many meteors do, the Pan American pilot, “having seen thousands of\r\nmeteors,” could not accept the object as a natural phenomenon although\r\nhe did realize, after he heard the other reports, that he had greatly\r\nunderestimated its distance. The object showed all the characteristics\r\nof a typical fireball, but the flying-saucer cultists have still tried\r\nto convert this undoubted meteor into an unknown object.\r\n\r\nThe number of meteors reported as flying saucers or spaceships has\r\ndiminished in the last few years, but the Air Force has continued to\r\ninvestigate all doubtful or puzzling sightings to determine whether\r\nthey in any way represent a possible threat to the nation’s security.\r\nEvery sure identification of a UFO as merely a meteor, not a ballistic\r\nmissile, brings a certain amount of relief.\r\n\r\nA typical case, successfully solved, is that of June 20, 1959. About\r\n2:15 A.M. the pilot of a United Airlines flight over the Pacific\r\nreported by radio to Flight Operations that he had observed an apparent\r\nrocket firing about thirty-five miles west of the plane position; radar\r\ndetected the presence of a surface vessel at about the same position.\r\nThe pilot first noticed a flash of light, then the entire sky lighted\r\nup and he saw four round, fiery globules, of an intense bluish-white\r\ncolor, with no tails. Flying two by two in a straight line, they made\r\nno sound and disappeared after about two seconds. The weather was clear\r\nand calm, the visibility excellent. The copilot, sitting at the right,\r\nsaw only the first flash, but the pilot of another plane some 120 miles\r\nto the west reported seeing the same objects at the same time[V-19].\r\n\r\nBecause this sighting occurred in a very sensitive area where military\r\nofficials were expecting a Russian test firing of an ICBM, the Air\r\nForce made an exhaustive study of this report and identified the object\r\nas a meteor. Their evaluation proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\nThe United Airlines pilot estimated the distance of the objects as\r\nonly about thirty miles and their rate of travel as about 15 degrees\r\nin two seconds. These figures indicated a velocity of approximately\r\n14,500 miles per hour, about the speed of a ballistic missile. But\r\nthe relatively low altitude, the flat trajectory, and the fact that a\r\nvisible “power plant” was apparently still operating at this stage of\r\nflight ruled out the possibility of a missile. However, if the observer\r\nhad underestimated the distance and the objects were actually hundreds\r\nof miles away, then the data would indicate a speed of about 50,000\r\nmiles an hour, in the range of meteor velocities. The descriptions\r\ngiven closely matched that of the classic fireball, whose colors range\r\nover white, blue, green, red, and yellow, and whose luminosity may be\r\nas great as -3 magnitudes. The Air Force concluded that the object\r\nsighted was, in all probability, a meteor.\r\n\r\nA similar sighting, which saucer enthusiasts have publicized as a\r\nbrilliantly lighted UFO that appeared to hold a definite course,\r\noccurred at 3:02 A.M. on July 11, 1959, also over the Pacific[V-19].\r\nThe pilot of a Pan American Airlines flight reported that a mysterious\r\nbright object accompanied at its left by four smaller lights had\r\napproached his plane at “inconceivable speed,” made a sharp right turn,\r\nand then disappeared. The objects seemed to be flying evenly spaced in\r\nformation, and the pilot, who had never seen anything like it in all\r\nhis years of flying, told the newspapers, “I’m a believer, now.”\r\n\r\nThe official investigation began immediately. Four other commercial\r\nflights had reported seeing the object at the same time. In each\r\ncase, the pilot stated that the objects seemed to head straight at\r\nhis plane at high speed on a collision course, then made a 90-degree\r\nturn and disappeared. The various reports, however, showed significant\r\ndisagreements. Some witnesses gave the color as white, some as\r\norange-yellow. Of the several pilots, each gave a different description\r\nof the “formation”: a big light with four smaller lights flying at\r\nthe left; a big light surrounded by a cluster of six or seven smaller\r\nlights; a big light followed by four smaller lights; a big light in the\r\ncenter of a rectangle formed by four smaller lights. Of the five pilots\r\nwho made official reports, one said the phenomenon was definitely not a\r\nmeteor, two said it could have been a meteor, and two did not venture\r\nan opinion. The pilots of several other flights stated, on landing,\r\nthat they too had seen the object but had not radioed a report because\r\nthey assumed it to be a meteor.\r\n\r\nAfter mapping and correlating all the observations, ATIC completed\r\nthe analysis and released the result to the press on July 14, only\r\nthree days after the sighting, a remarkably efficient piece of work.\r\nConclusion: the object was a fireball[V-20].\r\n\r\nThe literature of flying saucers contains dozens of similar incidents\r\nthat fit perfectly into the meteor pattern. Pointing to this list of\r\n“unidentified” flying objects, saucer addicts still abuse the Air Force\r\nfor concealing the “fact” that these UFOs are actually spaceships!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Great Meteor Processions_\r\n\r\nEven more dramatic than the ordinary exploding meteor whose fragments\r\nnaturally fall into a pattern around it, a cluster of fireballs or\r\na great procession of meteors occasionally startles the world. On\r\nDecember 21, 1876, about 8:45 P.M. such a swarm of fireballs appeared\r\nover Kansas and disappeared some three minutes later over Pennsylvania,\r\nhaving traveled the thousand-mile distance at a velocity of 20,000\r\nto 25,000 miles an hour. Hundreds of persons in Kansas, Missouri,\r\nIllinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Pennsylvania saw the display, which\r\nincluded nearly 100 separate fireballs; the leader was more brilliant\r\nthan the full moon and many of the followers were brighter than Venus\r\nor Jupiter. Perhaps fortunately for the nerves of the public, the most\r\nrecent such display occurred before the saucers began to fly (March 24,\r\n1933). This cluster of fireballs was visible chiefly in the skies over\r\nNew Mexico and left a great cloud that was visible for at least three\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nThe most spectacular of such formations was the great meteor procession\r\nof February 9, 1913. At about 9:05 in the evening the leader or leaders\r\nappeared in the sky over western Canada, their fiery red bodies\r\nfollowed by long streaming tails. These immense fireballs showed no\r\ntendency to fall toward the earth but, like the green fireballs of New\r\nMexico, “moved forward on a perfectly horizontal path with peculiar,\r\nmajestic, dignified deliberation,” and disappeared in the distance\r\nto the southwest. No description can surpass that given by Professor\r\nChant[V-21] who spent two weeks in locating and interviewing many of\r\nthe witnesses.\r\n\r\n“Before the astonishment aroused by this first meteor had subsided,\r\nother bodies were seen coming from the northwest, emerging from\r\nprecisely the same place as the first one. Onward they moved, at the\r\nsame deliberate pace, in twos or threes or fours, with tails streaming\r\nbehind, though not so long nor so bright as in the first case. They\r\nall traversed the same path and were headed for the same point in the\r\nsoutheastern sky.\r\n\r\n“Gradually the bodies became smaller, until the last ones were but\r\nred sparks, some of which were snuffed out before they reached\r\ntheir destination. Several report that near the middle of the great\r\nprocession was a fine large star without a tail, and that a similar\r\nbody brought up the rear.\r\n\r\n“To most observers the outstanding feature of the phenomenon was the\r\nslow, majestic motion of the bodies; and almost equally remarkable was\r\nthe perfect formation which they retained. Many compared them to a\r\nfleet of airships, with lights on either side and forward and aft;...\r\nOthers, again, likened them to great battleships, attended by cruisers\r\nor destroyers.”\r\n\r\nNo other recorded meteors have persisted for so great a distance.\r\nThousands of persons saw this great procession as it soared over\r\nSaskatchewan, central Canada, Toronto and the Great Lakes region, New\r\nYork and Pennsylvania, the shipping lanes from New York to Bermuda, and\r\non over the South Atlantic, where before it vanished it was observed\r\nby ships as far south as Brazil--a distance of some 5000 miles, one\r\nfifth of the earth’s circumference. The descriptions do not vary\r\nsignificantly and they all mention the slow, level flight, parallel to\r\nthe earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nSome astronomers have suggested that these unusual meteors may\r\nhave been a group of natural satellites deflected by the earth’s\r\ngravitation, slowing down and finally disintegrating as they made their\r\nfinal revolution[V-14]. But if the UFO cult had existed in 1913, the\r\nflying-saucer enthusiasts would probably have regarded the fireball\r\nprocession as a fleet of spaceships, and would have speculated on the\r\nproblem of what planet dispatched them and for what purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chiles-Whitted Sighting_\r\n\r\nThe Chiles-Whitted UFO, sighted on July 24, 1948, is one of the most\r\npublicized of the classics. Although the object appeared, passed, and\r\nvanished in an interval of roughly ten seconds, and the descriptions\r\ngiven by the three witnesses differed on several vital points, Dr. J.\r\nAllen Hynek, astronomer consultant to ATIC, in his report of April\r\n30, 1949, identified it as an undoubted meteor. Nevertheless, not\r\nuntil 1959 did the Air Force officially accept this solution, and the\r\nliterature of saucerdom still cites the incident as indisputable proof\r\nof alien spaceships.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of July 23 an Eastern Airlines DC-3 took off from\r\nHouston, Texas, en route for Boston, with an experienced pilot and\r\ncopilot in the cockpit. By 2:40 A.M. C.D.S.T. July 24 the plane was a\r\nfew miles southwest of Montgomery, Alabama, flying at an altitude of\r\n5000 feet. The night was clear, and a bright moon just four days past\r\nfull shone through a layer of broken clouds about 1000 feet above the\r\nplane. At 2:45 A.M. the pilot, Captain C. S. Chiles, noticed a dull\r\nred glow some distance ahead, approaching from a little above and to\r\nthe right of the plane. He remarked to his copilot, Lieutenant J. B.\r\nWhitted, “Look, here comes a new Army jet job.”[V-19] In the next few\r\nseconds, however, he changed his mind about the identity of the object.\r\nAs both men watched, the brilliantly glowing unknown continued to\r\napproach with incredible swiftness, apparently on a collision course;\r\nit seemed to veer slightly, passed the plane on the right almost level\r\nwith and parallel to the flight path, then seemed to pull up sharply\r\nand disappear into the clouds. Captain Chiles estimated that the object\r\nwas in sight for about ten seconds. The one passenger who was awake,\r\nsitting at the right of the cabin, saw the light for only an instant as\r\nit flashed by.\r\n\r\nThe brief impressions of these three witnesses were the sole foundation\r\nfor newspaper stories that the plane had narrowly escaped collision\r\nwith a spaceship.\r\n\r\nIn their official report both pilots agreed on the general appearance\r\nof the UFO: it looked like a wingless aircraft with no fins or\r\nprotruding surfaces, was cigar-shaped, about 100 feet long, and about\r\ntwice the diameter of a B-29 superfortress. It seemed to have two rows\r\nof windows through which glowed a very bright light, brilliant as a\r\nmagnesium flare. An intense dark-blue glow like a blue fluorescent\r\nfactory light shone at the bottom along the entire length, and\r\nred-orange flames shot out from the rear to a distance of some fifty\r\nfeet. Neither man heard any sound and neither saw any occupants. In\r\ntheir original report to ATIC both men agreed that “no disturbance was\r\nfelt from the air waves, nor was there any prop wash or mechanical\r\ndisturbance when the object passed.” The third witness, the passenger,\r\ndid not report any turbulence or rocking of the plane. Some of the\r\nlater versions of the incident gloss over these facts, however, and\r\nthus exaggerate the startling nature of the sighting. One account\r\nsubtly implies the presence of a pilot in the UFO and several state\r\nthat, as the object passed, the plane hit turbulent air[V-7, p. 61]\r\nor was “rocked” by the UFO[V-20, p. 21].\r\n\r\nLike most eyewitness descriptions of a startling event, the testimony\r\nof the three men differed. Chiles stated that at the front of the UFO\r\nwas a lighted pilot compartment or cockpit with a “snout” similar\r\nto a radar pole, and that a kind of nozzle projected from the rear\r\nfrom which the flames fanned out to a width of twenty or thirty feet.\r\nWhitted did not see a cockpit, a snout, or a rear nozzle; he thought\r\nthe flames flared out from the entire rear and were never any wider\r\nthan the width of the UFO itself. The third witness, the passenger,\r\nsaw no shape or form, only an intensely brilliant streak of light\r\nthat appeared and vanished before he was able to focus his eyes. As\r\nresponsible officers, both pilots had obviously tried to separate the\r\nobserved phenomena from their interpretation. They differed widely\r\non the estimated distance of the UFO (the passenger did not offer an\r\nestimate). Chiles thought it passed them with a margin of only about\r\n700 feet, but Whitted believed the distance to be more than ten times\r\ngreater, about a mile and a half. However, when we remember that these\r\nmen had the UFO in sight for only a small fraction of a minute and that\r\ntheir study of the side view (“windows,” “cockpit,” etc.) must have\r\nbeen limited to the instant of passing, these disagreements are not\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Chiles and Lieutenant Whitted reported their frightening\r\nexperience, the Air Force made a prompt investigation. Since Captain\r\nChiles explicitly stated his belief that the UFO was under intelligent\r\ncontrol, the case required careful consideration. A check of the air\r\ntraffic showed that no other planes had been in the area at the time,\r\nso the object could not have been a normal aircraft. Furthermore, other\r\nequally reliable witnesses reported seeing unusually bright meteors\r\nin the Southeast that night. Since the bare physical description of\r\nthe UFO, apart from the inferences made, was identical with that of a\r\nfireball, Dr. Hynek concluded that it was an unusually bright meteor.\r\n\r\nBut the climate at ATIC that summer was not friendly to a prosaic\r\nexplanation. Remembering the tragic death of Captain Mantell some\r\nsix months earlier while he was chasing a UFO, then unidentified (p.\r\n33), some officials were more than half ready to believe in invading\r\nspace fleets as the answer to every puzzling phenomenon in the sky.\r\nThey rejected the fireball explanation. Instead of accepting the\r\nChiles-Whitted UFO as a meteor, they identified the other two meteors\r\nseen that night as UFOs!\r\n\r\nAnd yet the evidence is overwhelming that the UFO _was_ a fireball.\r\n\r\nThe major meteor showers that occur on schedule every year have\r\naccounted for hundreds of alleged UFOs over the last fifteen years.\r\nSeveral of these showers begin in mid-July; thus July 24 falls in a\r\nperiod of greatly increased meteor activity, when the earth is moving\r\nthrough the Aquarid streams and is encountering the forerunners of the\r\nPerseids. All during the year, and particularly during these weeks\r\nof shower meteors, amateur astronomers throughout the country spend\r\nmany evenings watching the sky, counting meteors, mapping their paths,\r\nand reporting the data to various observatories. On an average night\r\noutside the shower periods, if there are few clouds and no moon, an\r\nexperienced watcher may count about half a dozen meteors in an hour’s\r\ntime, but during a shower he usually sees many more. For the week of\r\nJuly 23 to 30, 1948, the records of the American Meteor Society, the\r\nHarvard College Observatory, and the Flower and Cook Observatory show\r\nthat, in spite of the interference of a bright moon, large numbers of\r\nmeteors were counted and the paths of many of them were mapped and\r\nplotted.\r\n\r\nThe reports from the Southeast for that week have particular interest\r\nfor the Chiles-Whitted case. A regular observer in Alabama counted\r\nfifteen meteors in one hour’s watching on the evening of July 24, and\r\ntwenty-one in two hours the following night[V-22]. On the evening of\r\nJuly 26 he apparently took a holiday, but many other persons saw a huge\r\nfireball that flashed over North Carolina and Tennessee at 9:36 P.M.\r\nE.S.T.; its radiant (AMS 2322), plotted from many reports, showed it to\r\nbe a member of the Delta Aquarid stream, then approaching its maximum.\r\nEarly on the morning of July 27 another fireball soared over Tennessee\r\nand apparently exploded[V-23]. On the night of July 28 the Alabama\r\nwatcher recorded fifteen meteors, from which he obtained the radiants\r\nAMS 3269, 3270, and 3271[V-9, p. 521].\r\n\r\nThese facts alone--the occurrence of scheduled showers and the number\r\nof well-plotted meteors observed during the period--point strongly\r\nto the probability that the Chiles-Whitted UFO was a meteor. The\r\nprobability becomes virtual certainty when we examine the available\r\nrecords for the night of July 23 and morning of July 24, the period\r\nwhen this particular UFO appeared. The watcher in Alabama was not on\r\nduty, but another observer in Iowa counted fourteen meteors in one\r\nhour[V-22], more than double the rate for an average night. About an\r\nhour before the UFO appeared in Alabama, ground observers at Robins\r\nAir Force Base near Macon, Georgia, reported an unusually bright\r\nmeteor going from north to south. A few minutes before the Alabama\r\nsighting, two Air Force officers flying between Blackstone, Virginia,\r\nand Gainsborough, North Carolina, reported an unusually bright meteor\r\ntraveling in a southerly direction.\r\n\r\nWhen Chiles and Whitted observed their UFO, its appearance and manner\r\nof motion were identical with those of many other bright meteors but\r\nthe pilots, startled by the sudden apparition, misinterpreted what they\r\nsaw. They probably overestimated the length of time the meteor was in\r\nview and they almost certainly underestimated the distance. Meteors\r\nnotoriously mislead even the experienced observer, who often sees them\r\ndisappearing “just behind the next hill,” when they may actually be\r\nfifty or a hundred miles away. Although the night was moonlit and clear\r\nexcept for broken clouds, the witnesses had no fixed reference point by\r\nwhich to determine either distance or size.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Chiles and Whitted misinterpreted the\r\nappearance of an unusually brilliant meteor, its body glowing to white\r\n(the momentarily persisting luminous train of a meteor often has a\r\nveined or fibrous structure that could easily have suggested the\r\n“lighted window” and “cockpit”) and blue incandescence (the glowing\r\n“undercarriage”) as it rushed through the atmosphere some fifty\r\nmiles or more away, shooting off flaming gases (the “exhaust”) and\r\nvaporizing from the friction of the atmosphere. Flashing beyond their\r\nrange of vision (“pulling up into the clouds”), it probably burned and\r\ndisintegrated before it reached the earth.\r\n\r\nThis fresh analysis, based on meteor records for July 1948, has led\r\nATIC finally to remove the Chiles-Whitted UFO from the category of\r\nUnknowns and, as Dr. Hynek suggested originally, add it to the file of\r\nrecorded meteors.\r\n\r\nA more recent sighting that closely resembled the Chiles-Whitted\r\nincident occurred on the evening of January 8, 1959, and was promptly\r\nreported to ATIC [V-19]. Two Air Force pilots were flying in a C-45\r\ntype of aircraft from Phillipsburg to Brookville, Pennsylvania, at an\r\naltitude of 8000 feet. The night was clear and moonless. At 6:14 P.M.\r\nE.S.T. they observed what appeared to be a brilliantly lighted solid\r\nobject rushing toward them. Bluish green in color, shaped roughly\r\nlike a teardrop and about 200 feet in diameter, it made no audible\r\nsound. Glowing like a small sun, it seemed to be flying level with the\r\naircraft, less than a mile away and headed straight for the plane.\r\n\r\nThe frightened pilot jerked on the controls in an attempt to dodge\r\nthe object, but almost before the plane could respond the unknown had\r\ndisappeared. It had been in sight about three seconds. In his official\r\nreport he estimated that the object had been the size of a pool ball\r\nheld at arm’s length and that it had been not more than a mile away.\r\nThe copilot, however, did not agree. A man with special training and\r\nunusual experience in the study of UFOs, he estimated the object to be\r\nthe size of the head of a pin held at arm’s length and the distance to\r\nbe at least 300 miles. The extreme brilliance of the object against\r\nthe night sky, he thought, had made it seem larger. In his opinion,\r\nsupported by Air Force investigation, the unknown had been a fireball\r\nat least fifty miles high that had burned out and vanished as they\r\nwatched.\r\n\r\nAs in the Chiles-Whitted case, ground observers also saw the object and\r\nthus provided independent confirmation of the analysis. A member of\r\nthe Ohio State University reported to the Harvard College Observatory\r\nthat on the night of January 8, at approximately 6:15 P.M. E.S.T., he\r\nhad watched a brilliant bluish-white meteor streak across the sky over\r\nColumbus and vanish within a few seconds. The fireball must indeed\r\nhave been high and spectacular to be visible at the same moment from\r\npoints nearly 300 miles apart.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Flaming UFOs_\r\n\r\nNot all spectacular UFOs are meteors, of course, any more than they\r\nare all planets or balloons or rockets. Sudden brilliant illuminations\r\nof the night sky can have any one of a dozen or more explanations. The\r\natmosphere is crowded with potential Unknowns, more than at any time\r\nin man’s history. The air surrounding our planet plays host not only\r\nto meteors and fireballs, birds and insects, but also to military and\r\ncommercial planes, private planes, jets, helicopters, weather balloons,\r\nexperimental rockets, and an ever-growing number of artificial\r\nsatellites. An ear-shattering detonation that rattles a house or breaks\r\na window may come from an exploding fireball or it may come from a jet\r\npenetrating the sound barrier. Without an exact knowledge of all the\r\ncircumstances, only the foolhardy would attempt to say positively what\r\ncaused any given unusual aerial phenomenon.\r\n\r\nLet us consider a sighting that might have received various wrong\r\ninterpretations and would probably have become one of the most\r\nfamous of the UFOs cited by saucerdom, had investigators lacked full\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nShortly after midnight one spring morning reliable witnesses on the\r\neast coast, particularly in Connecticut and Long Island, reported a\r\nbrilliant bluish-white object flying at high altitude and incredible\r\nspeed. As it flashed overhead, it changed color to become reddish,\r\nand several smaller objects apparently detached themselves from the\r\nmain body and followed it in orderly fashion. About five minutes later\r\nmore than fifteen ships in the Caribbean area observed similar objects\r\nsoaring overhead but the reports varied in many details. Ship number\r\ntwo saw brilliant short flames darting about behind the main body,\r\nwhich had a long, tapered tail. Ship number four saw a flaming white\r\nobject more brilliant than the full moon. Ship number seven reported a\r\nflaming green ball followed by a group of several small objects. Ship\r\nnumber nine observed at least fifteen smaller objects that suddenly\r\nseparated from the main body and fell into formation behind it. Ship\r\nnumber eleven saw an object with a trail several miles long, brilliant\r\nas a peacock’s tail, so luminous that the deck and sea around were\r\nbathed in pale light as the mass crossed overhead. Ship number twelve\r\nreported, “The main body appeared to have a blue-white head, then a\r\nshort dark space before the glowing orange-yellow tail. Twenty-seven\r\nseparate particles were actually counted as they appeared in the main\r\nplume. Each followed the main body and each developed its own glowing\r\ntail on leaving it.” The main body was several times brighter than\r\nVenus, while the offshoots were each twice the magnitude of Sirius.\r\nOne observer described it as round on top and bright blue-white, while\r\nthe lower half, which was emitting sparks, seemed to be flattened and\r\nreddish in color.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of less than five minutes, similar objects were\r\nobserved from the ground by witnesses in the Virgin Islands. One man in\r\nMartinique saw a luminous green globe, brighter than Venus, followed\r\nat a slight distance by a flaming red, enormously long, cigar-shaped\r\nobject. Observers in Barbados saw two huge objects followed by from\r\ntwelve to eighteen “offspring” shaped like the main body; some of the\r\noffspring subdivided to form two small cometlike objects. The object\r\ndisappeared into a cloud bank and vanished. No observations were\r\nreported from areas farther south.\r\n\r\nThese unidentified objects were reported over an area stretching\r\nfrom Connecticut to the coast of British Guiana, a distance of about\r\n2700 miles. They flew in a straight course. All of the objects were\r\nnoiseless. They were remarkably brilliant. They seemed to have one or\r\nmore leaders, to discharge smaller objects, and to fly in formation.\r\nThey maintained a substantially horizontal path, and only the last\r\nobservers, who saw the things disappear into the cloud bank, noted any\r\ntendency to descend. No fragments were ever found, and all witnesses\r\nagreed that the objects were not like meteors. If all the observers\r\nwere describing the same single phenomenon, it was flying at the\r\nincredible speed of more than 16,000 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nWhat was it?\r\n\r\nWith only these facts to build on, an investigator might interpret\r\nthe sightings according to his own prejudices: an invasion fleet from\r\nanother planet making a reconnaissance in force, the mother ships\r\ndischarging the smaller craft at intervals; a mass hallucination; a\r\npeculiar meteoric display.\r\n\r\nWithout knowledge of one essential fact, some hundreds of landsmen and\r\nseamen in the United States, the Caribbean islands, and the British\r\nWest Indies might now feel firmly convinced that they had witnessed\r\na genuine “Unknown.” The date was April 14, 1958. The privileged\r\nobservers had witnessed the death of Sputnik II, the Russian satellite\r\nlaunched on November 3, 1957[V-24].\r\n\r\nThe UFO reports inspired by this event presented no problem to the\r\nAir Force. All information on the re-entry of artificial satellites\r\nis immediately accessible to ATIC. Whenever a reported UFO shows any\r\npossible resemblance to a falling satellite, Air Force investigators\r\ncheck at once with Spacetrack. Astronomers who had been tracking this\r\nsatellite as it circled the earth had predicted more than a month in\r\nadvance that it would spiral toward the earth and fall sometime between\r\nApril 12 and April 15. A few days before the actual event they had\r\nrefined their estimate and predicted the time of the fall within a few\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n[V-1] _Meteoritics_, Vol. II, 1954.\r\n\r\n[V-2] Keyhoe, D.

According to his story, he was “... out\r\none very dark night stopping up fox-earths. While I was so engaged I\r\nsaw a very bright blue light pass close to my face and was very much\r\nstartled as I saw it going away from me ... I put it down as some\r\ninsect.” After the mysterious light reappeared a few nights later, the\r\ngamekeeper prudently began carrying his gun and eventually he managed\r\na shot at the light. To his amazement he brought down “a poor old\r\nhalf-starved barn owl, _Tyto alba_, whose body continued to glow for\r\nsome hours after death.”[VI-1]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Luminous Owls of Norfolk_\r\n\r\nSome ten years later, on the night of February 3, 1907, another\r\nEnglishman and his son while taking a walk observed a similar luminous\r\nphenomenon. Apparently about a quarter of a mile away, it moved\r\nhorizontally over a course several hundred yards in length, reversed\r\ndirection, then rose into the air to the height of forty feet or more.\r\n“It then descended and again went through the same evolutions many\r\ntimes. The light was slightly reddish in the centre, and resembled\r\na carriage lamp for which we at first mistook it. We watched it for\r\ntwenty minutes and were quite at a loss to ascertain its cause.\r\n\r\n“On December 1st, 1907, when again reaching the top of Twyford Hill, I\r\nnoticed what I took to be the lamp of a motor bicycle moving rapidly\r\nalong the Bintree road to the south. The light suddenly stopped, rose\r\ninto the air above the trees and retraced its course. This it did\r\nseveral times, sometimes rising twenty to forty feet into the air, and\r\nthen rapidly descending. I called my groom and his wife from their\r\ncottage a few hundred yards away, and they watched it with me for\r\nseveral minutes. I then went to my house about half a mile off, and\r\nfrom one of the attic windows watched it with my son and three servants\r\nfor a short time....”\r\n\r\nThe mysterious light appeared frequently for a period of weeks,\r\nmaneuvering silently, its luminosity sometimes so great that “it\r\nliterally lighted up the branches of the trees as it flew past them.”\r\nAttempts to identify it through a telescope were unsuccessful but\r\neventually one observer was lucky enough to hear a sound as the light\r\nsoared past, and at once identified it by its unique call as a white\r\nowl, _Strix flammea_[VI-2].\r\n\r\nIf these sightings had occurred half a century later, the witnesses\r\nmight well have called them flying saucers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Things That Glow in the Dark_\r\n\r\nThe luminous owls of Norfolk have appeared at intervals since\r\n1866 to frighten the superstitious and puzzle the naturalist, but\r\nornithologists managed to solve the mystery some years ago[VI-3]. The\r\nbirds acquire their temporary luminosity from contact with a common\r\nfungus, _Armillaria mellea_, popularly known as “honey-tuft.” This\r\nmushroom, which mycophagists prize for its delicious flavor, grows in\r\nlarge clumps on dead trees and stumps. The dark-brown cap is rough,\r\nwith fibrous scales, while the white gills are hooked or toothed at\r\nthe end and the spores are white. The dense white lacework of the\r\nroot system or mycelium, which gives off a phosphorescent light, may\r\npermeate the entire tree and extend even into the fibers at the base of\r\nthe tree. Wood infested with the fungus can glow in the dark, sometimes\r\nso brightly that a man could read his watch by its light.\r\n\r\nMany of the tales of fox fire, corpse candles, and lanternmen\r\nundoubtedly come from glimpses of this fungoid phosphorescence. Owls\r\nthat seek refuge in the dark interiors of hollow trees during the\r\ndaytime may brush against the veins of the mycelium, which adheres to\r\nthe feathered body. Flitting about at night, the luminous bird becomes\r\nthe dancing flame of the will o’ the wisp.\r\n\r\nOther luminous mushrooms abound in woods, swamps, and marshy areas.\r\nDecaying, they may produce an unearthly light and can give off a\r\npeculiarly unpleasant odor. Unexpectedly seeing and smelling a bird\r\ntouched with the substance, on a dark night, a witness might well feel\r\nbewildered and even frightened. _Polyporus sulfureus_, which grows in\r\ndense masses on dead trees, often phosphoresces brilliantly in the\r\nearly stages of its decay, as does _Clytocobe illudens_, the jack o’\r\nlantern. In the tropics these fungi may produce enough light to read\r\nby. Birds, insects, and animals that brush against them can carry\r\naway some of the luminous material and thus, for a time, appear to be\r\nluminous themselves.\r\n\r\nMost of us recognize fireflies, lightning bugs, or glowworms--which are\r\nnot worms but beetles. The wingless females must creep on the surface\r\nof ground or branch, but the winged males flit through the air. These\r\nsparkling creatures form part of the diet of birds and bats, and when\r\ncarried aloft to be consumed in flight can make one more mysterious,\r\nswiftly moving light to frighten the apprehensive. The earth teems\r\nwith other self-luminous organisms such as frogs’ eggs, which most\r\nof us have never seen and would not recognize. Luminous parasites\r\nsometimes live in the feathers of birds and make them glow. The plumage\r\nof the great blue heron, a North American bird, can emit a pale light\r\nsometimes known as the birds’s “lantern” because it is supposed to\r\nhelp him while fishing. Fish or meat when decaying can become infected\r\nwith luminous bacteria and thus shine brilliantly in the dark. The sea\r\nis filled with phosphorescent fish and plants which help perpetuate\r\ntales of sea serpents. Some waters in the Caribbean contain so dense a\r\npopulation of phosphorescent algae that a bird, dipping its wings to\r\nsnatch a meal, will glow for minutes after it soars again into the air.\r\nThese luminous birds, innocently fishing for dinner, probably account\r\nfor many reports that flying saucers come and go from underwater[VI-4].\r\n\r\nMany of the erratically behaving UFOs observed at night over wooded\r\nareas, swamps, and marshes have undoubtedly been one of these will o’\r\nthe wisps--winged creatures glowing with borrowed fire. Unfortunately\r\nproof of this explanation is rarely possible. Before the startled\r\nobserver can recover his wits the flitting “saucer” has gone, taking\r\nwith it the evidence of its identity.\r\n\r\nFear of the unknown is not confined to _Homo sapiens_. A news item\r\npublished in England a few years ago reveals that the animal kingdom,\r\ntoo, may have its ghosts. Under the headline, _Owl Attacks Luminous\r\nMan_, the article reads:\r\n\r\n“A Bournemouth long-distance runner, Ken Baily, was attacked by an owl\r\nlast night when he was running through the centre of Bournemouth in a\r\nluminous track suit. The bird ripped the front of his suit before it\r\nflew back into the trees.\r\n\r\n“Baily said afterwards: ‘I heard it hooting before it attacked. The\r\nsuit is luminous so that motorists can see me, but if it attracts owls\r\nlike this I’d rather take a chance with the traffic.’”[VI-5]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sea Gulls as UFOs_\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon of December 10, 1941, three days after the\r\nattack on Pearl Harbor, a research technician standing at the\r\nfourth-floor window of a laboratory in Boston saw a number of bright\r\nobjects maneuvering high in the sky and slowly descending over the\r\ncity. Making a quick guess at their distance, size, and speed, he\r\nconcluded that the objects were parachutes, the first of a Japanese\r\ninvasion. Only after they had dropped to the level of a nearby church\r\nspire was he able to gain the right perspective, correct his estimates,\r\nand identify the objects as sea gulls drifting down with the winds.\r\n\r\nA decade later, the public was no longer worried about danger from\r\nJapan but was concerned about possible invasion from outer space. Sea\r\ngulls flashing in the sun were interpreted not as parachutes but as\r\nflying saucers.\r\n\r\nMany luminous UFOs have in fact been ordinary living creatures,\r\nnormal inhabitants of the earth--owls that had acquired a temporary\r\nluminosity, sea gulls reflecting the sunlight, flights of birds\r\nreflecting the lights of a town. But in trying to identify them, the\r\nwitness is influenced by the pattern of his time. In 1897 and 1907 the\r\nworld seemed reasonably secure. Observers of mysterious lights made\r\nfairly accurate estimates of their distance and size and compared\r\nthem to familiar, everyday things--an insect and a carriage lamp. In\r\n1941, three days after Pearl Harbor, the world was at war and the\r\nobserver’s imagination, stimulated by a hundred rumors of imminent\r\nJapanese invasion, transformed cruising sea gulls into parachutes. By\r\n1950, when space travel had become at least a theoretical possibility\r\nand scientists were discussing ways to reach the moon, uneasy persons\r\nfantastically overestimated the height and size of mysterious lights in\r\nthe sky and sometimes saw birds as spaceships from another planet.\r\n\r\nA well-publicized incident took place on the morning of July 16, 1952,\r\nwhen a Coast Guard photographer at Salem, Massachusetts, happened to\r\nglance out of a window and see four bright, egg-shaped objects moving\r\nin the sky. Grabbing his camera, he managed to take a picture before\r\nthe objects were lost from view. According to some saucer enthusiasts,\r\ncertain reproductions of the photograph show typical UFOs shaped like\r\ntwo saucers arranged face to face, as though joined by a ring at the\r\nmid-line[VI-6]. The official Coast Guard photograph however, shows\r\nmerely four bright, fuzzy-edged blurs arranged in a rough V formation.\r\nOnly imagination could convert these spots of light into spaceships.\r\nMany readers of this book have probably seen similar objects gleaming\r\nbriefly in the sun, mysterious for the moment, and then identified\r\nthem as gulls or airplanes when a shift in orientation cut down the\r\nreflection.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the Coast Guard photograph the day was exceptionally\r\nclear, the sun extremely bright, and the sky a deep blue unusual on the\r\nMassachusetts coast. Under these circumstances, objects reflecting the\r\nsun look larger and brighter than normal. Because the picture was taken\r\nwith a dirty lens through a window, the images were further distorted.\r\nSince the UFOs did not produce highlights on the tops of the cars in\r\nthe foreground, as luminous objects overhead would have done, they were\r\nprobably not in the sky at all. Elaborate Air Force experiments with\r\nphoto-flood lamps showed that the images were reflections in the window\r\nglass from an interior light source behind the camera (see Plate IVa).\r\n\r\nWeird and frightening apparitions do occur; Air Force files bulge with\r\nreports suggesting that unfamiliar objects are moving around us day\r\nand night, by land, sea, and air. Imagination endows them with life or\r\nturns them into mysterious, saucer-shaped craft manned by creatures\r\nfrom Mars, Venus, or even from some planet of a star beyond our solar\r\nsystem. The UFO photographed over France on October 2, 1954 (a weekend\r\nwhen every French village was reporting saucers by the dozen), shows\r\nno details and might be almost anything: a bird, a balloon, a cloud of\r\ngossamer, the sun, a plane, or merely the result of a lens defect (see\r\nPlate IVb).\r\n\r\nHow many of the UFOs listed in the saucer publications originate from\r\nbirds, insects, and animals we cannot know, but the number must be\r\nlarge. Most of us have only a sketchy acquaintance with the non-human\r\nforms of life that share the earth with us. Seeing an unfamiliar\r\ncreature suddenly, or a familiar creature under unusual circumstances,\r\nwe often imagine it to be whatever we most fear--vengeful spirits of\r\nthe departed, fire-breathing dragons, devils, parachutes, or flying\r\nsaucers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lubbock Lights_\r\n\r\nThe luminous objects sighted in Texas during the last week of\r\nAugust, 1951, would probably have been explained and forgotten in a\r\nweek’s time, except for the publication of alleged photographs of\r\nthe unknowns. This complication converted a simple incident into a\r\nconglomerate of puzzles which, though actually unrelated, were lumped\r\ntogether to form a classic Unknown. The most detailed published account\r\nof this case[VI-7, p. 133 ff.] contains a number of statements that\r\ndiffer in detail from those in the official files. When discrepancies\r\nexist, the facts as given in this chapter are those in the original Air\r\nForce reports[VI-8].\r\n\r\nThe Saturday night of August 25, 1951, was uncomfortably hot in the\r\nSouthwest, and many persons spent the evening in the relative coolness\r\nout of doors. In the town of Lubbock, a professor of geology was\r\nsitting in his yard with two guests, fellow members of the faculty,\r\ndiscussing micrometeorites and counting meteors, which for several\r\nnights had been more numerous than usual. The sky was clear and\r\ncloudless and seeing conditions were ideal. About 9:20 the men noticed\r\na group of fifteen to twenty lights passing silently overhead, going\r\nfrom north to south. They were obviously not meteors or planes, but\r\ndisappeared too quickly to be identified. About an hour later a second\r\ngroup of lights appeared, forming a rough semicircle or crescent like a\r\nstring of beads. Shortly before midnight a third group soared overhead\r\nin a random pattern (see Figure 11).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 11._ Schematic sketch of lights observed by the\r\nprofessors at Lubbock, Texas. Left, pattern in the first and third\r\nsightings; right, pattern in the second sighting.]\r\n\r\nTrying to account for the phenomenon, the men agreed that all three\r\nflights had appeared suddenly, not gradually, in about the same part of\r\nthe sky. Only the second had shown any sort of pattern, all had moved\r\nsilently from north to south, their luminosity was not constant but had\r\nvaried in intensity, and all had disappeared suddenly, not gradually,\r\nat about the same point in the sky. The men did not agree on the color,\r\nwhich they described as yellowish to white, with a soft glow. The\r\nlights had passed too swiftly for the men to locate them in relation to\r\nspecific stars and there were no clouds in the sky; thus they had no\r\nknown reference points by which to judge altitude, distance, or size.\r\nSince the lights had apparently moved over about 30 degrees of sky in\r\none second, however, and the observers estimated the altitude as 5000\r\nto 50,000 feet, the unknowns must have had an enormous size and an\r\nincredible speed of from 1800 to 18,000 miles an hour--typical flying\r\nsaucers.\r\n\r\nUnderstandably curious, the host telephoned the managing editor of\r\nthe local newspaper, the Lubbock _Evening Avalanche_, hoping that a\r\nprinted account would elicit more information from other persons who\r\nhad noticed the mysterious lights. The report appeared in the Sunday\r\npaper, August 26, but in the days that followed, no reader responded.\r\n\r\nThen on Friday August 31, five days after the original story had\r\nappeared and apparently died, it suddenly came to life. A college\r\nfreshman who occasionally sold news photographs to the Lubbock paper\r\nbrought in five pictures of a group of mysterious lights he had\r\nphotographed the night before. He had been lying in bed next to an open\r\nwindow, he explained, and shortly before midnight he had observed a\r\nformation of brilliant lights moving rapidly across the sky. Grabbing\r\nhis camera, a Kodak 35-mm., he had rushed out into the yard and, after\r\na brief wait, had been able to photograph two similar flights that\r\nraced overhead a few minutes apart. Each light had been brighter than\r\nVenus, they had maintained a perfect V formation, and had sped from\r\nhorizon to horizon in a mere four or five seconds. Yet this amazing\r\napparition had apparently gone unnoticed by all except the lucky\r\namateur.\r\n\r\nFearing a hoax, both the editor and the staff photographer hesitated\r\nbut, since the negatives displayed no obvious evidence of fraud, they\r\nfinally bought and printed the pictures and distributed them over the\r\ncountry through the United Press.\r\n\r\nPeople all over the nation could now argue the question: What were the\r\nLubbock lights? A few said flying saucers. Many Texans said ducks,\r\nplover, or other migratory fowl. But the things in the pictures didn’t\r\nlook like birds; and if they weren’t birds, what were they? Some\r\npersons bluntly called them a hoax.\r\n\r\nImpelled perhaps by the growing publicity, the staff photographer of\r\nthe _Evening Avalanche_ several times tried to duplicate the pictures\r\nby photographing flights of birds at night. He allowed himself better\r\nequipment--a Speedgraphic camera loaded with a tungsten ASA 80 film,\r\nand a GE no. 22 flashbulb in a concentrating reflector. Opening\r\nthe camera to f 4.7 at 1/10 second, he went up to the roof of the\r\nnewspaper building to try his luck. After a brief wait he was able to\r\nphotograph a flock of birds that appeared high overhead, reflecting the\r\nmercury-vapor lights of the street, flying noiselessly in a “ragged” V\r\nformation, but the image on the negative proved too faint for use. The\r\nnext night he tried again, using a Kodak Reflex set at f 3.5, Super XX\r\nfilm, at 1/10 second, plus the flashbulb and concentrating reflector.\r\nThe birds appeared on schedule, but again the images proved too faint\r\nfor use. The experimenter concluded, probably correctly, that the\r\namateur must have photographed something much brighter than birds.\r\n\r\nNot until late October, nearly two months after the original incident,\r\ndid the Air Force receive official notice of the mystery at Lubbock,\r\nand Captain Ruppelt of ATIC arrived to interview witnesses in Lubbock\r\nand the neighboring towns of Lamessa, Brownfield, and Big Spring. He\r\nquickly discovered that he had two mysteries to solve instead of one\r\nsince, according to the witnesses who had started all the excitement,\r\nthe objects shown in the pictures were wholly unlike the luminous\r\nphenomena observed by the three professors. The pictured lights formed\r\na perfectly geometrical, flat V, while the original objects had formed\r\na random pattern. Furthermore the pictures showed brilliant, sharply\r\noutlined lights as intense as unshaded electric bulbs, while the\r\noriginal objects had been softly glowing.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the professors themselves had been trying to solve their own\r\nmystery. During September and October they had observed at least a\r\ndozen similar flights, and in an attempt to obtain the true altitude\r\nof the objects they had organized a field survey, operating in the\r\ncountry to achieve better seeing conditions. Two groups of observers\r\nwere stationed at two different points, a measured distance apart,\r\nwith radio communication between the two. By making simultaneous\r\nobservations, they hoped to calculate the true height of the objects\r\nand thus obtain accurate estimates of size and speed. This well-planned\r\nexperiment failed because the lights never appeared to the watchers in\r\nthe country even on nights when they were clearly visible in the town.\r\nNevertheless the scientists did establish one fact: the altitude could\r\nnot be as high as 50,000 feet, their original estimate. An astronomer\r\nin the group, calculating from the few data available, showed that the\r\nheight must have been only 2000 to 3000 feet, less than a tenth of the\r\nfirst estimate.\r\n\r\nContinuing his investigation, Captain Ruppelt found that other persons\r\nhad seen the lights on the night of August 25--and identified them.\r\n\r\nAt Brownfield, Texas, some thirty miles from Lubbock, a rancher and his\r\nwife had been sitting in their back yard when they noticed a group of\r\nfifteen to twenty lights flying overhead from north to south, silently,\r\nin no particular formation. They appeared to be very high and had “a\r\nkind of glow, a little bigger than a star.” Some time later a second\r\ngroup flew over. When a third group appeared, flying lower, he could\r\nsee that they were birds; as they moved on to the south and one of the\r\nbirds emitted a cry, he recognized the familiar call of the plover.\r\nPlover have a wing span of a foot and their oily white breasts form an\r\nexcellent surface for reflecting the lights beneath them.\r\n\r\nLike most old-time residents of the area, the rancher was accustomed\r\nto the yearly exodus of migratory fowl. Traveling at night in groups\r\nof six to twenty, they usually flew at 1000 feet or lower at a maximum\r\nspeed of about fifty miles an hour in the weeks from late August to\r\nmid-November. The rancher had read about the professors’ sighting,\r\nwhich sounded exactly like his own. It would have baffled him, too, he\r\nsaid, if he had not gotten a good look when the third flight circled\r\nthe house and if he had not happened to hear the single call.\r\n\r\nAnother resident reported, much later, that he had often seen such\r\nlights and recognized them as birds. One night he had noticed “a\r\nformation of ducks pass over so low that you could actually see the\r\nwhole bodies with their shiny white undersides glowing.” At other times\r\nhe had seen ducks flying at low altitudes with only the undersides\r\nglowing and creating an illusion of objects moving very fast at a high\r\naltitude[VI-9].\r\n\r\nIn spite of the overwhelming evidence that the original objects had\r\nbeen birds, probably plover, reflecting the city’s lights, Captain\r\nRuppelt chose to regard them as mysterious and listed the professors’\r\nsighting as an Unknown. Several years later he wrote that a natural\r\nexplanation did exist but, for some reason, he had promised not\r\nto divulge it[VI-7, p. 150]. Still later, he asserted without\r\namplification that the lights had been night-flying moths reflecting\r\nthe bluish green of mercury-vapor street lights[VI-10, p. 276]--a\r\nsurprising anticlimax, in view of his earlier secrecy. In a reanalysis\r\nof the facts made in 1959, Major (now Lieutenant Colonel) R. J. Friend\r\nof ATIC and Dr. J. Allen Hynek, science consultant, determined beyond\r\ndoubt that the objects had been plover.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Lubbock Pictures_\r\n\r\nThe problem of the photographs remained. In Dayton, Air Force experts\r\nstudied the four available negatives.\r\n\r\nThe photographer had used a Kodak 35-mm. camera, lens at 3.5, Plus-X\r\nfilm, and an exposure time of 1/10 second. The negatives were badly\r\nscratched and dirty from much handling. According to the photographer’s\r\nstory, each flight of unknowns had moved from horizon to horizon in\r\nfour to five seconds and had passed directly overhead; he had “panned”\r\nhis camera with the movement of the objects and had managed to snap two\r\npictures during one flight and three during the next.\r\n\r\nAnalysis yielded no suggestion that the negatives had been tampered\r\nwith but they offered no clue to the background, identity, height,\r\ndistance, or speed of the things shown. The images themselves, however,\r\naroused some doubts. Each frame showed twenty bright spots against a\r\nuniform dark background. No trace of stars or starlight could be found,\r\nalthough the sky that night had been clear and cloudless. The spots\r\nshowed evidence of slight motion during the exposure but the amount of\r\nblurring was amazingly slight, considering the speed with which the\r\nphotographer claimed to have moved his Kodak. Professional cameramen\r\ntried repeatedly to duplicate the performance, but failed. The most\r\nsuccessful try produced only two pictures, badly blurred, in four\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nThe most crucial discrepancy between negatives and story, however,\r\nwas revealed by the pattern of the spots, which formed a flat V.\r\nThe orientation of the V was the same on all the negatives. If the\r\nformation had actually passed directly overhead and the photographer\r\nhad panned with it, as he claimed, then he must have taken all his\r\npictures either as the lights approached him or as they receded. If\r\nhe had taken two successive pictures, one as the formation approached\r\nand the next as it receded, the V would have reversed position in\r\nthe second picture--V would have changed to ∧--unless he had managed\r\nto stand on his head while taking the second picture. And if he had\r\nactually taken all his pictures either as the lights approached or as\r\nthey receded, he had performed the incredible feat of obtaining two\r\nclear, sharp photographs, while panning, in a mere two seconds.\r\n\r\nAlthough these facts suggested that the explanation given for the\r\npictures was at least highly improbable, Air Force experts refrained\r\nfrom labeling them frauds. Professional photographers can undoubtedly\r\nmake various guesses as to how the pictures were made and the possible\r\nidentity of the V of bright spots, but proof is impossible. In the Air\r\nForce files they remain in the category of Unknowns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Winged UFOs_\r\n\r\nDuring the era of the saucers, winged creatures were responsible\r\nfor many UFO stories. But winged creatures do not stay put, and in\r\nflying away they usually take with them the evidence that the alleged\r\nspaceships were actually only birds or insects.\r\n\r\nOne such incident occurred at Downey, California, on May 29, 1951. Late\r\nin the afternoon three technical writers for North American Aviation\r\nwere standing outdoors chatting and looking at the sky when suddenly\r\nthey noticed about thirty glowing, meteorlike objects moving in the\r\neast, about 45 degrees above the horizon. They made no sound and left\r\nno trail. Emitting an intense electric-blue light, the objects made\r\nfantastic right-angled turns and swept across the sky in an undulating\r\nvertical formation, apparently covering about 90 degrees of sky in\r\nabout 25 seconds. The diameters of the objects were estimated at 30\r\nfeet and the speed at 1700 miles an hour[VI-11].\r\n\r\nMany persons concluded that the unknowns must be interplanetary in\r\norigin because, as _Life_ magazine commented, no natural object\r\nhurtling at such a speed could execute a right-angled turn, and no\r\nknown machine could fly so fast without making a sound or leaving a\r\ntrail. No one could quarrel with this statement, but it has no obvious\r\nrelation to the incident in question. Technical writers are not\r\nnecessarily trained observers, and these witnesses had no way to make\r\na reliable estimate of the height of the objects. Without an accurate\r\nestimate of at least one quantity--true altitude, true size, or true\r\nspeed--the others are meaningless. The unknowns were probably birds,\r\nbut they could equally well have been butterflies, bits of paper, or\r\nmerely ashes blowing over the two-story building.\r\n\r\nWinged creatures sometimes avoid the interplanetary label only by\r\nstaying in sight long enough to be examined. About sundown on May 19,\r\n1955, switchboards at police stations in the Los Angeles area were\r\nswamped by telephone calls reporting a fleet of silvery flying saucers,\r\nchanging formation with incredible speeds “as if playing tag in the\r\nsky.” One witness, however, had the presence of mind to get out his\r\nbinoculars and look at the objects; they were birds with dark wing\r\ntips. Thinking they might be geese, he called the State Division of\r\nFish and Game, which identified the “saucers” as a flock of _Pelicanus\r\nerythrorhynchos_, an inland species of pelican that float on the\r\nprevailing wind currents[VI-12].\r\n\r\nSometimes an observer identifies such objects correctly, but later\r\nbegins to doubt his own judgment. About 7:30 in the evening of August\r\n26, 1956, a man driving along a highway in California noticed a flock\r\nof about nine small birds flying northward, dark against the blue sky.\r\nIn a random group, they moved freely among themselves as birds do but\r\ncontinued in a northern direction. The witness watched the birds as\r\ncarefully as possible, but the intermittent glimpses possible when\r\na man is driving a car did not allow him to make good estimates of\r\ntheir size or height. Nevertheless, he guessed at their distance and\r\ncalculated that they covered an arc of 60 degrees in five seconds,\r\nwhich would mean a speed of about 1000 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nInstead of questioning the accuracy of his estimate, for some reason he\r\ndoubted his first identification. If the objects could fly 1000 miles\r\nan hour, he reasoned, then they were not birds after all, and must be\r\nflying saucers![VI-13]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tremonton Movies_\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous controversies resulting from a flight of birds\r\ncentered on the Tremonton, Utah, films of UFOs.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of July 2, 1952, a Navy photographer and his family\r\nwere on their way to California, driving near the town of Tremonton,\r\nUtah, not far from the Great Salt Lake. At about 11:10 A.M. the man’s\r\nwife noticed something unusual in the sky. Stopping the car, the man\r\nobserved about a dozen shiny, disklike objects “milling around the sky\r\nin a rough formation.” Getting out his movie camera, a Bell and Howell\r\n16-mm. equipped with a 3-inch telephoto lens, he started photographing\r\nthe group. Just before it disappeared toward the west, one object left\r\nthe main group and headed east. The photographer obtained about forty\r\nfeet of film before the objects vanished. After developing the film, he\r\nsent it to the Air Force for evaluation, together with his opinion that\r\nthe objects had been huge and had traveled at very high altitude at\r\nsupersonic speeds. This was only an impression, however, for as he told\r\ninvestigators from ATIC: “There was no reference point in the sky and\r\nit was impossible for me to make any estimate of speed, size, altitude,\r\nor distance.”[VI-8] The pictures are of such poor quality and show\r\nso little that even the most enthusiastic home-movie fan today would\r\nhesitate to show them to his friends. Only a stimulated imagination\r\ncould suggest that the moving objects are anything but very badly\r\nphotographed birds.\r\n\r\nThe movies show nothing that can be recognized--merely bright blurs of\r\nlight moving at random. Their luminosity is not constant, and the spots\r\nfade out and then become bright again. The frames include no clouds,\r\nno trees, no house, no hill--no known reference point by which to\r\ncalculate the altitude, size, or distance of the moving lights. After\r\nexhaustive study the photographic experts concluded that the negatives\r\nhad not been tampered with and that, unlike the Lubbock stills, the\r\npictures had been made exactly as described. But pictures of what? The\r\nobjects were not balloons and not planes. At the time, the experts\r\nalso rejected the theory that they might be birds because, in their\r\n[mistaken] opinion, birds could not produce such bright reflections.\r\n\r\nIf the Tremonton movies contained no proof that the objects were birds,\r\nstill less did they contain proof that they were round machines from\r\nouter space, and ATIC finally classified the sighting as “Unknown.”\r\nLater, however, Captain Ruppelt noted the strong resemblance to sea\r\ngulls he observed “riding a thermal” in the sky above San Francisco.\r\nThey were “so high that you couldn’t see them until they banked just\r\na certain way; then they appeared to be a bright white flash, much\r\nlarger than one would expect from sea gulls.” [VI-10, p. 290]\r\n\r\nAir Force investigators later concluded that the famous Tremonton\r\nmovies show merely the large white gulls that soar near Utah’s Great\r\nSalt Lake. The objects were photographed shortly before noon on a\r\nhot summer’s day, against a deep-blue sky without any clouds to\r\nobscure the high sun. The fading and brightening of the lights, their\r\nindividual motion within the group, and the one object that suddenly\r\nleft the group, all are consistent with the behavior of a flock of\r\nbirds, probably gulls, whose plumage is reflecting the sun. The glossy\r\nfeathers of these birds can flash as brilliantly as a satiny metal\r\nsurface as they circle and change position with respect to the sun. The\r\nbirds can be dazzling against the clear, dark-blue sky of the western\r\nstates. So brilliant is the flash that it wholly obscures the object\r\nthat is reflecting the light.\r\n\r\nLike many other puzzling UFO reports, the objects in the Tremonton\r\nmovies were living lights--a case for the ornithologist rather than the\r\nAir Force.\r\n\r\nA bright light moving erratically as it crossed and recrossed the field\r\nof view caused an experienced pilot and copilot to execute violent and\r\nevasive maneuvers in a flight over the dark Pacific.[VI-14] The errant\r\nUFO proved to be only a firefly inadvertently trapped between the panes\r\nof the double windshield.\r\n\r\n[VI-1] Rolfe, F. _Eastern Daily Press_, January 16, 1908.\r\n\r\n[VI-2] Purdy, R.

Coleman. Personal communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chapter_ VII\r\n\r\nPANIC\r\n\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1952, the period that Captain Ruppelt called “the big\r\nflap,” offers a history of the UFO mania in capsule form. If the\r\nnewspapers were to be believed, the heavens were crowded with armadas\r\nof spaceships both visible and invisible. There was even a monster\r\nstory to add spice to the tales.\r\n\r\nYet the panic was largely an artificial creation. All spring the\r\nnation’s movie-goers had been flocking to see a well-made thriller,\r\n_The Day the Earth Stood Still_, in which a mysterious glowing object\r\nappears in the sky over Washington, D.C., and lands in the middle\r\nof the city. The object proves to be a flying saucer from another\r\nplanet, whose inhabitants want only to help the human race. Looking\r\nsomething like a huge poached egg, a hump in the center sloping down\r\nto a circular rim, the pictured vehicle offered a dramatic example to\r\nanyone in the mood to see a spaceship but not quite sure how it should\r\nlook. In fact, many of the saucers described in the months and years\r\nfollowing were obviously based on this model.\r\n\r\nThe summer’s hysteria was also nurtured by the fears of some Air\r\nForce investigators who were convinced that UFOs were intelligently\r\ncontrolled craft originating outside the earth[VII-1, p. 286].\r\nAlthough these officials realized that whenever an unusually good\r\nsaucer story appeared in the papers the number of sightings increased\r\nsharply in the days following, they apparently did not consider the\r\npossibility that the increase resulted from the power of suggestion.\r\nThis apprehensive attitude, plus three publications in the spring of\r\n1952, made the summer’s panic almost inevitable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Growth of a Panic_\r\n\r\nOn April 4 _Life_ magazine published an article whose title might well\r\nhave alarmed the most stolid: “Have We Visitors from Outer Space?”\r\nPresenting ten “insoluble” cases, the article managed to suggest\r\nwithout exactly saying so that interplanetary visitors were among us.\r\nThe very next day, April 5, the Air Force announced a new directive,\r\nordering the commanding officers of all Air Force installations to\r\nmake immediate, high-priority reports of all UFO sightings in their\r\nareas[VII-1, p. 178]. Reasonably inferring from the _Life_ article\r\nand from the new directive that Defense officials were concerned by the\r\nthreat of UFOs, newspapers gave space to all tales of flying saucers.\r\n_Look_ magazine then jumped on the bandwagon and on June 24 published\r\nan article, “Hunt for the Flying Saucers!” The public responded\r\nenthusiastically. Hypnotized by the prestige of these magazines, whose\r\nsaucer articles seemed to have the support of the Air Force, thousands\r\nof well-intentioned but poorly equipped observers joined in the hunt,\r\nwatched the skies, and began to cry “Tally-ho!” at every streak of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nNature cooperated. As in every summer, she offered a rich display of\r\nregular meteor showers. By mid-July Aquarids in large numbers are\r\nstreaking through the sky, to continue into mid-August, and by the\r\nbeginning of August the Perseids have arrived to join the summer’s\r\nparade. The records of the American Meteor Society reflect this rise\r\nin the number of meteors. In the nights from July 10 to 31, 1952, five\r\nobservers stationed in California, Oregon, Missouri, Iowa, and Long\r\nIsland, New York, counted a total of more than 2000 meteors in some\r\neighty-five hours of watching. The smallest number reported by a single\r\nobserver in any one hour was nine; the highest was fifty[VII-2].\r\n\r\nNature not only offered dramatic fireworks in the sky; she also\r\nproduced exactly the right conditions for viewing them. During June\r\nand July an unprecedented heat wave lay over the entire East, driving\r\nsweltering citizens out of doors to savor the relative coolness of the\r\nnight air. Furthermore, the nights were dark. The moon began to wane\r\non July 7, and until nearly the end of the month there was little\r\nmoonlight to dim the brilliance of the meteors flashing through the\r\nheavens. No wonder that frightened people hunting for saucers should\r\nhave had so little trouble finding them, when the sky seemed to be\r\nteeming with UFOs.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of July the nine-man investigating force at ATIC was all\r\nbut buried in saucer reports--more than forty a day, far too many to\r\nhandle either promptly or adequately. Only a very lengthy history of\r\nthe saucer era could describe and account for each one of the hundreds\r\nof UFOs reported during those weeks. A few of the most publicized\r\nincidents are listed here:\r\n\r\n    July 2. A group of UFOs photographed with a movie camera near\r\n    Tremonton, Utah (p. 130).\r\n\r\n    July 5. A UFO reported over an atomic plant at Hanford,\r\n    Washington. (A Skyhook balloon.)[VII-1, p. 203]\r\n\r\n    July 7. Flying saucer reported by hundreds of persons in\r\n    the Pacific Northwest. (This spectacular daytime meteor was\r\n    visible for a distance of 500 miles on either side of its path\r\n    and was reported from Washington, Idaho, Montana, Oregon,\r\n    California, Nevada, Utah, and Wyoming. It made no sound and\r\n    was so brilliant that observers called it the “Sunshine\r\n    Fireball.”)[VII-3]\r\n\r\n    July 12. A flying saucer, glowing blue-white, was reported over\r\n    Indiana. (Another fine meteor.)[VII-1, p. 203]\r\n\r\n    July 13–18. Flying saucers reported from all states in the\r\n    Union. (Observers for the American Meteor Society counted an\r\n    average of fifteen meteors per hour on those nights.)\r\n\r\n    July 14. A group of saucers over Chesapeake Bay and Norfolk,\r\n    Virginia (p. 256).\r\n\r\n    July 16. Saucers photographed by Coast Guardsman, Salem,\r\n    Massachusetts (p. 122).\r\n\r\nThe sighting hysteria was approaching the critical mass, and no special\r\nwisdom was required to see that an explosion was inevitable. The only\r\nquestion was: Where would it occur? The panic finally reached its\r\nclimax in the nation’s capital:\r\n\r\n    July 19. Flying saucers (invisible) invade Washington, D.C.\r\n    (See _Chapter_ VIII.)\r\n\r\n    July 26. Saucers again invade Washington (p. 155).\r\n\r\n    July 27. Saucers over Manhattan Beach, California (p. 49).\r\n\r\n    July 29. Saucers over Port Huron, Michigan (p. 160).\r\n\r\n    August 1. Saucer over Bellefontaine, Ohio (p. 162).\r\n\r\nMost of these and hundreds of other UFOs were eventually identified as\r\nmeteors, stars, balloons, jet planes, birds, searchlights, and radar\r\nangels. About the only aerial phenomenon that was not mistaken for a\r\nflying saucer during these weeks of panic was the planet Venus. Until\r\nthe end of August it was too near the sun to be visible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Scoutmaster’s UFO_\r\n\r\nTrue to the pattern set during 1947, the first summer of the saucers,\r\nthe panic of 1952 did not end without an elaborate hoax and a good\r\nmonster story.\r\n\r\nThe famous “Scoutmaster” incident occurred at West Palm Beach, Florida,\r\non the night of August 19[VII-1, p. 229]. According to the report\r\ngiven the Intelligence officer at the local air base, the scoutmaster\r\n(an ex-Marine) had offered to drive four of the boys to their homes\r\nat the close of the evening’s meeting. While traveling over a country\r\nroad bordered by scrub pine and palmetto thickets, he had noticed some\r\nmysterious lights among the pines and decided he must investigate.\r\nLeaving the frightened boys in the car with instructions to go for\r\nhelp if he had not returned in fifteen minutes, he took his machete\r\nand two flashlights and bravely set off into the dangerous woods. He\r\nwas found some time later by the boys, the constable, and the deputy\r\nsheriff, and was apparently terrified. When he entered the woods, he\r\nsaid, he noticed a peculiar odor and felt an oppressive sensation of\r\nheat. On looking up, he saw hovering above him a dark circular object\r\nwith a turretlike dome in the middle, so large that it blotted out most\r\nof the sky. When he went closer, a door opened, a ball of fire emerged\r\nand drifted toward him, enveloped him, and rendered him unconscious. He\r\ncalled on the boys to confirm the presence of the strange lights and\r\nthe huge machine, and as further proof he exhibited burns in his cap and\r\non his face and arms.\r\n\r\nSince scoutmasters are traditionally upright citizens, the story\r\nseemed to merit attention. Investigators from ATIC visited the scene,\r\ninterviewed all persons concerned, and sent the cap and the machete to\r\nDayton for analysis. Very soon, however, the drama began to fall apart.\r\nThe scoutmaster, after being interviewed by Air Force investigators,\r\nassumed an aura of mystery and stated publicly that he had been warned\r\nnot to talk. At the same time he hired a press agent and offered to\r\nsell his story to the newspapers. A study of the landscape showed\r\nthat the boys could not have seen any “machine” from the road. The\r\ntownspeople did not consider the woods dangerous. Aircraft preparing to\r\nland at the airport regularly flew over the area in question with their\r\nlanding lights on; to a person on the road, the lights might seem to be\r\nflitting through the woods. Furthermore the study showed that the scene\r\nhad been set in advance for a frightening incident. As they drove along\r\nthe lonely road, the scoutmaster had been talking about flying saucers\r\nand, after he stopped the car, had warned the boys that they might\r\nneed to go for help. The man’s reputation for veracity, too, began to\r\nmelt away, and one townsman remarked that if the scoutmaster claimed\r\nthat the sun was shining, he’d look up to see for himself before\r\naccepting the statement. The knife and cap showed no radioactivity. The\r\nlaboratory report from the Federal Bureau of Investigation showed that\r\nthe burn on the cap was made by a cigarette, and the “burns” on the\r\nhand and arm proved to be only superficial scorching of the hair and\r\ncould easily have been produced by the flame of a kitchen match.\r\n\r\nThis investigation cost the usual amount of time and money, but it was\r\nunquestionably a hoax[VII-4].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Monster in West Virginia_\r\n\r\nThe final incident in the summer’s panic occurred on the evening\r\nof September 12 when a family group near the town of Sutton, West\r\nVirginia, saw a flaming object flash across the sky and apparently\r\nland on a nearby hill. Taking their flashlights, they set out to\r\ninvestigate and, on reaching the hill, smelled an unpleasant odor. When\r\nthey turned on their flashlights, they stated, they saw two red eyes\r\nglaring at them; a huge monster, ten feet tall, breathing fire, with a\r\nbright-green body and a blood-red face, waddled toward them, and they\r\nturned and ran[VII-5].\r\n\r\nAir Force investigators concluded immediately that the flaming object\r\nfirst seen was the meteor observed that night by thousands of persons\r\nin Virginia and West Virginia and reported officially to various\r\nobservatories. What the frightened family saw when they reached the\r\nhilltop and flashed the light was probably the glowing eyes or body of\r\nsome mundane creature of the woods. A local group of civilian saucer\r\ninvestigators rejected this explanation, as usual, and after making its\r\nown study concluded that the monster story could very well have been\r\ntrue!\r\n\r\nThe monster is now enshrined in West Virginia history[VII-5], and forms\r\nthe subject of a new ballad written by Cindy Coy and set to the tune of\r\n“Sweet Betsy from Pike.” One verse and the chorus will suffice:\r\n\r\n      The size of the phantom was a sight to behold,\r\n      Green eyes and red face, so the story was told.\r\n      It floated in air with fingers of flame.\r\n      It was gone with a hiss just as quick as it came.\r\n\r\n  Chorus:\r\n\r\n      Oh, Phantom of Flatwoods, from Moon or from Mars,\r\n      Maybe from God and not from the stars,\r\n      Please tell us why you fly o’er our trees\r\n      The end of the world or an omen of peace?\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Panel of Civilian Scientists_\r\n\r\nWhen after three months of constant threat no flying saucers had yet\r\ntried to invade the country, the acute phase of the panic subsided.\r\nNevertheless, responsible officials in the Department of Defense\r\nwere uneasy, and Air Defense was particularly worried by the problem\r\nof the radar phantoms, whose cause was not fully understood (see\r\n_Chapter_ VIII). Even if UFOs proved to be normal phenomena, other\r\nvery real dangers existed in the situation. If the public believed\r\nin the possibility of extraterrestrial antagonists, a clever enemy\r\non earth simply by fabricating a few incidents could easily induce a\r\nmass hysteria that might paralyze the country. Also, if the number\r\nof saucer reports should be greatly multiplied by some artificial\r\nstimulus, their sheer numbers would clog communication channels,\r\ninterfere with the Early Warning System, and at a time of imminent\r\nattack from another part of the globe might cause a disastrous three-\r\nor four-hour delay in the activation of the Air Force network.\r\n\r\nGovernment officials, uncertain of the facts, were reluctant to decide\r\nor to state whether there was or was not convincing evidence of\r\nextraterrestrial surveillance.\r\n\r\nTo clear up the potentially explosive atmosphere, the Office of\r\nScientific Intelligence (OSI), under the Central Intelligence Agency,\r\ndecided to consult outstanding civilian experts and invited certain\r\neminent scientists to study and evaluate the evidence. For this purpose\r\nAir Force investigators assembled the complete data on the cases\r\nthey considered most significant. They also prepared, on their own\r\ninitiative, an unofficial report setting forth the evidence which, in\r\nthe opinion of several investigators, proved conclusively that UFOs\r\nwere interplanetary objects operating under intelligent control.\r\n\r\nAfter a preliminary meeting late in November 1952, the panel met on\r\nJanuary 12, 1953, to begin their study. The chairman was the late\r\nDr. H. P. Robertson, mathematician and physicist, of the California\r\nInstitute of Technology at Pasadena. The other members were Dr. Luis\r\nW. Alvarez, physicist, of the University of California at Berkeley;\r\nDr. Lloyd V. Berkner, an expert on radio propagation; Dr. Samuel\r\nA. Goudsmit, physicist, of Brookhaven National Laboratory; and Dr.\r\nThornton W. Page, astronomer, of Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore.\r\nAlso present were several officers of the OSI. To avoid possible bias,\r\nAir Force officers who had actively worked on UFO cases and civilians\r\nwho were closely identified with such studies were not asked to attend.\r\nThe cases studied included all the “classics,” such as the Tremonton\r\nand other movies, the Mantell and Gorman affairs, the radar sightings\r\nat Washington, D.C., as well as other less well-known reports.\r\n\r\nOne incident that particularly engaged the attention of the panel,\r\nand would probably have become a famous classic except that Air\r\nForce investigators had kept it a strict secret, was the sighting at\r\nPresque Isle Air Force Base in northern Maine. On October 10, 1952,\r\nat about 10 P.M. E.S.T., a group of weather observers had noticed a\r\nbright-orange object hovering low on the eastern horizon and had set\r\nup a theodolite to measure its altitude and bearing. As the glowing\r\nunknown slowly rose higher above the horizon and seemed to come closer,\r\nit appeared through the telescope of the theodolite as a circular disk\r\naccompanied by four flickering green lights, two on each side. Alarmed\r\nby this spectacular phenomenon, the observers called the Air Force\r\nBase at Limestone, some twenty miles north and east, to ask whether\r\nthe object was visible there. It was. Setting up a theodolite, the\r\nLimestone observers measured the height and bearing, and both groups of\r\nobservers sent the recorded data to ATIC.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 12a._ The Presque Isle sighting from two\r\nstations; the erroneous determination of North at Limestone seems to\r\nindicate a nearby UFO.]\r\n\r\nHere was the kind of situation the investigators had been hoping for:\r\nsimultaneous observations of a single object, made from two different\r\nstations a known distance apart. Calculations based on the altitudes\r\nand bearings reported by the two stations yielded fantastic results. In\r\na plot of the data (shown schematically in Figure 12a) the prolonged\r\nlines intersected, indicating a group of unknowns hovering 100 miles\r\nabove the earth and more than 50 miles off the Maine coast, of\r\ntremendous size and moving at high speed. Concluding that the objects\r\nmust have come from outer space, or were possibly a new type of\r\norbiting vehicle of Russian origin, the Air Force had promptly clamped\r\ndown the security lid. When ATIC’s science consultant, Dr. J. Allen\r\nHynek, looked at the data, he just as promptly disagreed with these\r\nideas and clearly identified the unknown as the planet Jupiter, which\r\nhad risen at 6:03 P.M. E.S.T. and at 10:00 was the brightest object\r\nin the eastern sky. The believers in the extraterrestrial theory were\r\nthen in the majority at ATIC, however. They had refused to accept the\r\nidentification, and submitted the Presque Isle sighting to the panel as\r\na prize example of UFO surveillance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 12b._ The Presque Isle sighting from two\r\nstations; the corrected determination of North indicates Jupiter at\r\ninfinity.]\r\n\r\nThe panel members quickly disposed of the case. The measurements\r\nreported from Presque Isle obviously pointed directly to the planet\r\nJupiter, not a mere 100 but millions of miles beyond the earth. If a\r\nconstant correction was applied to the bearings from Limestone, they\r\nalso agreed with Jupiter’s position. Careless use of the theodolite had\r\nproduced an error in the data. To measure the angle of an object above\r\nthe horizon, the observer has only to make sure that the theodolite is\r\nlevel, but to measure the bearing he must align it with true north,\r\na direction that cannot be determined by guesswork. The Limestone\r\nobservers had made a mistake in determining true north and had thus\r\nobtained a wrong bearing for the unknown. When the corrected data were\r\nplotted (shown schematically in Figure 12b) the prolonged lines were\r\nparallel, and both pointed squarely to the planet Jupiter at infinity.\r\n\r\nThe orange light was unquestionably Jupiter, and the accompanying green\r\nlights were its four bright satellites twinkling through the layers of\r\nthe earth’s atmosphere. Amazed that this uncomplicated case, already\r\nexplained by Dr. Hynek, should have been offered as evidence for the\r\nextraterrestrial origin of UFOs, the panel extended its investigation\r\nto the original observers at Presque Isle. The witnesses there were\r\nbewildered by the inquiry; they had checked the object when it appeared\r\nagain on the night of October 11, they said, and had then identified it\r\nas the planet Jupiter, but they had not thought it necessary to notify\r\nthe Air Force![VII-4]\r\n\r\nFor five long days the panel worked, analyzing every available bit\r\nof evidence as it related to four alternative theories: 1) that UFOs\r\nwere a supersecret device of some sort being developed by the United\r\nStates; 2) that UFOs were a supersecret device being developed by some\r\nforeign power; 3) that UFOs were normal phenomena wrongly interpreted;\r\nand 4) that UFOs came from other planets. As the panel succeeded in\r\nexplaining one after another of the fifty or so submitted cases, or was\r\nable to suggest a highly probable solution in terms of normal physical\r\nphenomena, the members reached their conclusion. Theory number one they\r\nrejected with complete certainty; they were 98 per cent certain that\r\ntheory number two was wrong, and 99 per cent sure that number four was\r\nalso incorrect (scientists are reluctant to accept any negative belief\r\nwith absolute certainty). The document submitted unofficially by ATIC\r\ninvestigators they also rejected for lack of evidence. All the facts,\r\nthey decided, supported theory number three, that the reported UFOs\r\nwere merely natural phenomena, wrongly interpreted[VII-6].\r\n\r\nThe panel delivered this evaluation to the Office of Scientific\r\nIntelligence, together with a recommendation that government agencies\r\nshould immediately abandon the policy of secrecy regarding UFO reports\r\nand should make public all the facts in every case. Unfortunately this\r\nrecommendation was not followed. The report included some rather\r\ncaustic comments on the general inadequacy of the investigative\r\ntechniques that had been used. As one of the members remarked\r\nunofficially, trying to get to the bottom of some of the sightings was\r\nlike cutting treacle. The panel report with its blunt criticisms was of\r\ncourse not intended for public release and, understandably, was kept\r\nclassified.\r\n\r\nAlthough the OSI had asked for an expert opinion, some Air Force\r\nand government officials were unwilling to accept the verdict when\r\nthey got it, and flatly refused to believe that UFOs were normal\r\nphenomena[VII-7]. When echoes of their disagreement escaped the\r\nsecurity screen, civilian saucer enthusiasts concluded with some\r\njustification that Air Force officials were “covering up.” They were.\r\nThey were not hiding any proof that flying saucers came from outer\r\nspace, however, as the saucer addicts charged, but were merely trying\r\nto conceal their own confusion and the panel’s criticisms.\r\n\r\nAs one member of the panel later stated to a correspondent, the\r\nexplanation of UFO beliefs “lies in a logical defect. It is this: UFOs\r\nform a class of all celestial observations that cannot be immediately\r\nexplained. There is no other truly common feature; some manifestations\r\nare optical, others are detected by radar; some are points, others\r\ncircular, others patterned; some are seen by night, others by day,\r\netc. The implication that they are somehow related is a false one, as\r\nwe know from the large proportion positively identified after the fact\r\n(what relation is there between Venus and a meteorological balloon?).\r\nCalling all unidentified objects in the sky ‘flying saucers’ or even\r\nUFOs (Venus doesn’t ‘fly’ in any proper sense of the word) is like\r\ncalling any word I cannot understand ‘Greek.’ The class of all words I\r\ncannot understand would scarcely form a single language. Therefore, the\r\nexplanation of UFOs as a class is simply that they are not a uniform\r\nclass but a hodge-podge of widely disparate, partly described phenomena\r\nthat were seen in the sky.”[VII-8]\r\n\r\nNot until April 9, 1958, did the Air Force make public the internal\r\nrecommendation made by the panel some five years earlier. If the entire\r\nstudy had been released earlier, with a full statement of the facts and\r\nthe analyses made by the panel, it might have ended the saucer scare at\r\nonce. Instead the UFO hysteria continued, with periods of remission,\r\nand is still dying a slow and lingering death.\r\n\r\n[VII-1] Ruppelt, E.

Because\r\nradar is an electronic device, it allegedly cannot be fooled by\r\nmirages, reflections, or peculiar weather conditions. If radar records\r\nan echo from an unidentified object and, at about the same time, a\r\nhuman witness reports a puzzling light in the sky, the believers\r\nproclaim that the unprejudiced testimony of science has confirmed the\r\npresence of a solid flying saucer. Sometimes a radarscope reports\r\nunidentified objects at a time when observers on the ground and in\r\nsearch planes cannot see anything unusual in the sky. The believers\r\nthen conclude not that radar evidence can be misinterpreted, but that\r\nthe operators of the flying saucers may somehow be able to make both\r\nthemselves and their ships invisible![VIII-1]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Radar as a Reporter_\r\n\r\nAny UFO investigator who presumes to evaluate electronic evidence\r\nshould have much more than an amateur’s knowledge of the nature and\r\nbehavior of radar. Correct interpretation of the signals requires\r\ntraining, experience, skill, and an expert’s acquaintance with the\r\npeculiarities of the set under varying conditions. But even the\r\nexpert does not yet understand the causes of all the phenomena that\r\ncan appear. He is limited by our still incomplete knowledge of\r\ndynamic meteorology--precise information about the composition of\r\nthe atmosphere and how it interacts with microwaves. With proper\r\ninstrumentation and first-rate operators, radar can correctly report\r\nthe approximate direction, distance, altitude, and rate of motion of\r\nobjects within its range. If the returns are misinterpreted, however,\r\nradar can seem to give false reports.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 13._ Schematic view of radar targets on\r\nsuccessive sweeps of the antenna.]\r\n\r\nRadar is not a TV camera or a photographic lens. It does not, at least\r\nat present, produce a picture of the physical appearance, shape, size,\r\nor color of the thing it detects. The scope shows only tiny spots of\r\nlight on the flat surface of a screen. A pointer something like a clock\r\nhand continually sweeps around the dial at a given speed. A complete\r\nrotation may take from two to fifteen seconds, depending on the type\r\nof the set. This sweep hand keeps pace with the rotation of the radar\r\nantenna as it scans the sky by sending out radio pulses. When they\r\nencounter a solid object, they bounce off and return to the set as\r\nechoes which show as “blips,” or spots of light, on the radarscope.\r\nThe operator must interpret these spots and try to identify them as\r\nplanes, helicopters, balloons, ships, mountains, clouds, birds, storms,\r\nhurricanes, or phantom echoes of various kinds. Safe commercial flying\r\ndepends on the accuracy of these identifications, as does the security\r\nof the country in periods of international tension.\r\n\r\nRadar only reports. It does not interpret. If the sweep hand on\r\nsuccessive rotations shows a spot of light apparently moving from\r\nposition _A_ to position _B_, to _C_, to _D_, the operator generally\r\nconcludes that the blips represent a single object that is moving at\r\na certain speed in a certain direction (see Figure 13). If successive\r\nsweeps show a spot of light that remains at position _A_, he usually\r\nconcludes that it represents a stationary object. If the blip moves a\r\nvery great distance in the interval between two sweeps or seems to jump\r\nerratically from one position to another, an amateur might interpret\r\nit as a spacecraft flying at incredible velocity--a flying saucer. But\r\nan expert would probably conclude, especially under certain weather\r\nconditions, that the scope was picking up echoes from two or more\r\nseparate objects, one reflecting briefly at position _A_, another at\r\nposition _B_, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Principle of Radar_\r\n\r\nRadar is an electronic assembly far too complex for detailed\r\ndescription here, but its basic principle is simple. It is merely an\r\necho machine that reflects radio waves instead of sound waves. To\r\nillustrate by a rough analogy, let us imagine that a man is standing\r\nin the middle of an open field on a very dark night. He wants to find\r\nout something of the contours of the surrounding country but his only\r\ntools are a compass, a watch with luminous dial and hands, and a large\r\nmegaphone. He raises the megaphone to his lips, points it directly\r\nnorth, and gives a sharp and piercing call: “Hi!” He now cups his hand\r\nto his ear and listens for an echo. Hearing no reply, he deduces that\r\nin the north there are no hills, tall buildings, or other obstructions\r\nthat might have produced an echo.\r\n\r\nChanging his position, he turns to the east and tries the experiment\r\nagain. After an interval his call returns as a faint echo: “Hi!” The\r\ntime elapsed between call and echo, according to his watch, is ten\r\nseconds. His call has taken five seconds to reach the object and five\r\nseconds more to return. Since he knows that sound travels at the rate\r\nof about 1000 feet a second, he deduces that an obstruction lies in\r\nthe east, about 5000 feet away. Slowly changing position, he repeats\r\nhis call at various points around the compass. Some echoes take longer\r\nto return than others, indicating more distant objects. Other echoes\r\ncome back in a fraction of a second, showing an object very close. Thus\r\nhe gradually constructs a mental map of the surrounding terrain.\r\n\r\nRadar detects and locates objects in a similar way, by reflecting sharp\r\npulses of radio waves. But spurious echoes, which sometimes deceive the\r\noperator, can also appear on the scope. These “anomalous” or abnormal\r\nreturns may have one of several causes, including the nature of the\r\nradar mechanism itself. To help explain this, let us go back to our\r\nanalogy of the man in the open field. Let us suppose that the man has\r\nmechanized his device. To ease the strain on his vocal cords, he has\r\nbuilt a megaphone with a record-playing device. The megaphone rotates\r\nautomatically and sends out a recorded “Hi!” once every twenty seconds,\r\nas regular as clockwork. To increase the sensitivity of his hearing, he\r\nwears ear trumpets that point in the same direction as the megaphone.\r\nThis procedure is more effective than cupping his ears and eliminates\r\nsome of the extraneous noise that might come in from the rear and the\r\nsides.\r\n\r\nWith this improved equipment the man now repeats his experiment. As\r\nbefore, he gets no signal from the north. When he turns to the east\r\nhe gets an echo after ten seconds, just as he did during his first\r\nexperiment. As he continues to turn slowly, like a minute hand on a\r\nclock dial, he mentally maps the positions of the echoes as distances\r\nalong the hand from the center of the dial, and compares this new map\r\nwith the crude one he constructed earlier. Basically the two agree.\r\n\r\nBut wait! From the southwest he hears a new echo that did not occur\r\nin his earlier experiment. It returns after two seconds and thus\r\napparently comes from an obstruction 1000 feet away. Puzzled, the man\r\ndecides to walk toward the object and check his observation. After he\r\nhas covered half the distance he stops, sends out a call, and listens\r\nfor the echo. The indicated distance to the echo-producing object is\r\nnow 500 feet, just as he calculated. And so he goes on, checking at\r\nintervals. When he has covered 990 feet he knows that he should reach\r\nthe obstruction at any moment and to avoid colliding with it in the\r\ndarkness he proceeds with extreme caution--995, 996, 997, 998, 999\r\nfeet. He puts out his hand, expecting to touch a building or a stone\r\nwall, and warily takes the last step. But he finds no structure of\r\nany kind, merely level ground. And at the same moment he finds to\r\nhis astonishment that he can no longer detect the echoes he had been\r\nfollowing. What has happened? Has his equipment been malfunctioning?\r\nOr was the unknown structure perhaps a vehicle from outer space that\r\nwaited until he was practically touching it and then rose silently in\r\nan enormous burst of speed and vanished?\r\n\r\nThe man checks and finds that his equipment is functioning perfectly,\r\nsince he can still pick up echoes from the terrain he had mapped\r\nearlier. He then walks back ten feet and listens once more for an\r\necho from the phantom structure. Again he gets a signal, apparently\r\nfrom an obstruction just ten feet ahead. Has the mysterious object\r\nsuddenly returned? But how could it have done so without disturbing\r\nthe atmosphere or making a noise? By this time our man is frightened\r\nas well as puzzled, but he boldly decides to make one more experiment.\r\nHe walks again to the point where the obstruction should be. Signaling\r\nagain to the southwest, he now gets a faint echo apparently from a\r\ndistance of 10,000 feet. Tired as he is, he starts walking toward this\r\nnew obstruction and eventually reaches his goal. He now finds the\r\ntrue source of the returns--a high hill that rises abruptly from the\r\nplain. The hill is 10,000 feet away from the position indicated by the\r\noriginal series of echoes, and 11,000 feet away from the place he stood\r\nwhen he first sent out the signals.\r\n\r\nFinally the man figures out the explanation. When he made his first\r\nexperiment, with primitive equipment, he had given one sharp shout\r\nand then waited for a long time for the signal to return; thus there\r\nwas never any uncertainty about the source of the echo. The time that\r\nelapsed between shout and return had clearly indicated the distance of\r\nthe echo-producing object. But the improved automatic equipment of the\r\nsecond experiment produced a train of signals going out continuously\r\nat regular intervals, twenty seconds apart. Therefore when the sound\r\nwaves encountered a definite object, a train of echoes began coming\r\nback, twenty seconds apart. An object at a distance of 10,000 feet\r\nwould return an echo in twenty seconds; another object at a distance\r\nof 11,000 feet would return an echo in twenty-two seconds. But an\r\necho from this second object would reach the listener at exactly\r\nthe same time as an echo from an object only 1000 feet away. He now\r\nunderstands why he seemed to detect a structure at a distance of 1000\r\nfeet which disappeared as he approached and then reappeared 10,000 feet\r\nfarther away. In fact, the object that returned the misinterpreted\r\necho could have been 20,000 or 30,000 or 40,000 feet farther away--any\r\nmultiple of 10,000 feet. Large numbers of signals were returning every\r\ntwenty seconds. The man had no way of deciding for certain whether\r\na particular echo came from the most recent signal and therefore\r\nindicated a relatively close object, or whether it came from an earlier\r\nsignal and therefore from a more distant object.\r\n\r\nBroadening his experiment our man eventually learned other\r\ncharacteristics of these echoes. He found that on the average day he\r\nwas rarely plagued by this uncertainty in identifying the returns. The\r\nsecond-round echoes were very weak, almost undetectable, and therefore\r\ncaused no major problem. But on other days, under different weather\r\nconditions, sound tended to travel long distances without losing much\r\nin intensity. On such days the echoes were often confusing.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Weather and Radar Echoes_\r\n\r\nRadar is an echo machine that reflects radio waves instead of sound\r\nwaves. Instead of traveling at the speed of sound, about 1000 feet a\r\nsecond, radio waves travel at the velocity of light, 186,000 miles a\r\nsecond. Successive pulses go out at very short intervals, perhaps one\r\none-thousandth of a second apart, so that each pulse is followed by\r\nanother just 186 miles behind it. If the operator gets a return from an\r\nobject that is apparently at a distance of 25 miles, he must sometimes\r\nallow for the possibility that he is getting a secondary echo and that\r\nthe actual distance may be different. The object that produces the echo\r\nmay be at a distance of 25 plus 186 miles, or 25 plus twice 186 miles,\r\nor 25 plus any other whole-number multiple of 186 miles.\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary circumstances, the reflections from very distant targets\r\nrarely confuse the operator. The curvature of the earth tends to shield\r\nthe radiation, and the distance factor alone reduces the intensity to\r\na negligible value. But weather can cause peculiar returns. A layer\r\nof warm air above cooler air at the earth’s surface has much the\r\nsame effect on radio waves that it has on light waves. A temperature\r\ninversion can produce radar “mirages”--commonly called “phantoms,”\r\n“ghosts,” or “angels.” Relatively small amounts of warm air, even mere\r\nwarm bubbles in a layer of colder air, will suffice. When the scope\r\nrecords a series of blips, the operator ordinarily assumes that all are\r\nreturns from a single object. If inversions of temperature or humidity\r\nexist in the atmosphere, however, the series of returns may represent\r\nseveral different ground objects rather than a single object in the\r\nsky. Since these inversion layers do not remain fixed but move, change,\r\nand shimmer, on one sweep the radar may reflect one ground object and\r\non the next sweep some fifteen seconds later may reflect a totally\r\ndifferent ground object five or six miles away from the first. An\r\ninexperienced operator might conclude, wrongly, that both echoes came\r\nfrom a single object that had traveled five miles in a fraction of a\r\nminute (see Figure 14). Similar mistakes in identity have caused many\r\nreports of radar flying saucers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 14._ Deflection of radar beams by temperature\r\ninversion. Top, radar picks up ground target. Bottom, on next sweep,\r\nradar picks up different ground target, which seems to indicate a\r\nfast-moving UFO.]\r\n\r\nSuch a radar incident occurred at one of our defense installations\r\nin Alaska early in the morning of January 22, 1952[VIII-2]. Shortly\r\nafter midnight a bright target appeared on the radarscope, moving down\r\nfrom the northeast, fairly high, and apparently traveling at about\r\n1500 miles an hour. Unidentified targets require particularly prompt\r\ninvestigation in this sensitive area so close to Siberia. Within\r\nminutes an F-94 jet was moving in from a fighter base 100 miles to\r\nthe south; two other jets were scrambled at intervals and vectored\r\nin toward the unknown target by ground radar. When radar switched to\r\nshort range, however, it always lost both the target and the pursuit\r\nplane, even though both were close to the radar site. The first jet\r\ncould find nothing in the air, and no echoes appeared on its radar.\r\nThe second jet saw nothing in the air, but its radar recorded a\r\nbrief, weak echo to the right at about 28,000 feet. The echo faded\r\nimmediately, returned briefly, and then disappeared as the jet closed\r\nin. The third jet, after cruising the area for ten minutes without\r\ndetecting anything visually or on radar, suddenly got a strong radar\r\nreturn from an apparently stationary target just as it passed over the\r\nground radar site. The pilot made three direct runs on the unknown.\r\nEach time he broke off the intercept when he got within 200 yards of\r\nthe target position as shown on his radar, for fear of collision. At no\r\ntime did he see anything at the supposed location of the target. (This\r\nexperience is somewhat analogous to that of our man who used echoing\r\nsound waves to locate a solid structure only to find, on reaching the\r\nindicated spot, that the structure was not there.)\r\n\r\nCaptain Roy James, chief of the radar section of ATIC, examined all the\r\ndata and the scanty weather reports then available for this Alaskan\r\narea, and concluded that the targets were ghost returns probably\r\nfrom the ground, caused by peculiar atmospheric conditions--the same\r\nconditions that had interfered with normal operation of the ground\r\nradar. Although ground structures are scarce in that part of Alaska,\r\nthey do exist, and so do mountains. The analysis was undoubtedly\r\ncorrect, even though knowledge of the location and movement of the\r\ntemperature inversion was too imprecise for the analyst to plot and\r\nlocate the true target that produced the reflections[VIII-3, p. 167].\r\n\r\nSome of the nation’s most brilliant physicists have carried out\r\nfundamental research into the behavior of microwaves under varying\r\nconditions. The technical nature of these investigations makes them\r\ndifficult to describe in ordinary language, but they provide vital\r\ninformation for the expert.\r\n\r\nOne such study has specifically attacked the problem of radar images\r\nthat perform rapid and erratic maneuvers at close range and seem to\r\novertake, fly parallel with, or almost collide with the pursuing\r\naircraft. Such returns may be caused by the “non-isotropic secondary\r\nscattering of energy” (that is, the radio waves are not reflected in\r\na uniform manner) from an airplane to a ground object, or from ground\r\nobject to plane. Under appropriate weather conditions the plane itself\r\ncauses the puzzling echoes, so that the velocity and movement of the\r\nradar “saucer” depend directly on those of the plane. When the aircraft\r\nis the first of the two scatterers, the radar saucer always appears\r\nat the same bearing as the plane, and is always farther away from the\r\ndetecting radar than is the plane. Thus the path of the phantom always\r\nlies outside the path of the aircraft, and when the jet performs a\r\n360-degree turn, the phantom also turns, on an outside path. However,\r\nif the jet happens to fly directly over the ground object that is\r\nreflecting the energy, then the observing radar will see the images of\r\nthe jet and the phantom flying on what seems to be a collision course.\r\n\r\nConversely, when the ground object is the first of the two scatterers,\r\nthe saucer phantom always occurs at the same bearing as the ground\r\nobject, and the distance to the phantom is always greater than to the\r\nground object. If the aircraft crosses the radial line from radar to\r\nground object, at a range exceeding the range to the object, then the\r\nechoes from plane and saucer almost merge at the point of crossing, in\r\na “near collision.” But if the plane flies “this side” of the object,\r\nthen the plane and saucer will never be closer together than the\r\ndistance between plane and ground object at the point of crossing. A\r\nheight-finding radar, trained on the pursuing plane, would show the\r\nphantom saucer apparently diving toward or climbing away from the\r\nplane, attacking and retreating at very high velocities[VIII-4].\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Kinross Case_\r\n\r\nSome such mechanism probably explains the radar returns reported in the\r\nKinross case, which some saucer publications cite as a proved instance\r\nin which a flying saucer attacked a plane. On the night of November\r\n23, 1953, an Air Force jet was scrambled from Kinross Air Force Base,\r\nMichigan, to intercept an unidentified plane observed on radar. The\r\njet successfully accomplished its mission and identified the unknown\r\nas a Dakota, a Canadian C-47. On its return to the base, however, the\r\nAir Force jet crashed into Lake Michigan and, as often happens when a\r\nplane crashes into deep water and the exact place of the crash is not\r\nknown, no wreckage was ever found. As the ground radar at Kinross had\r\ntracked the returning jet, the scope had picked up a phantom echo in\r\nthe neighborhood of the jet; the two blips had seemed to merge just as\r\nboth went off the scope.\r\n\r\nSince the crash was not reported as a UFO incident and did not involve\r\nany question of unidentified flying objects, ATIC was not asked to\r\ninvestigate the problem. The office of the Deputy Inspector General for\r\nSafety carried out a thorough inquiry and concluded that the crash had\r\nbeen an aircraft accident, probably caused by the pilot’s suffering\r\nan attack of vertigo. As for the two blips shown by radar, the night\r\nhad been a stormy one and atmospheric conditions had been conducive\r\nto abnormal returns. The phantom echo had almost certainly been a\r\nsecondary reflection produced by the jet itself, and it thus merged\r\nwith the return from the jet and vanished with it when the plane hit\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nSolely on the basis of this radar phantom, some civilian saucer groups\r\nhave tried to transform the Kinross crash into a UFO mystery with Air\r\nForce investigators as the villains, and have suggested that the ghost\r\nblip represented an alien spacecraft that happened to be cruising over\r\nLake Michigan that night and attacked the jet for one of two reasons:\r\n1) The saucer might have tried to avoid close contact with the jet by\r\nemploying a “reversed G-field beam” (see _Chapter_ IX); colliding with\r\nthis beam as with a stone wall, the jet crashed. 2) The saucer might\r\nhave used the G-field to scoop the plane out of the air and take it\r\naboard the spacecraft; the captured pilot might have been needed to\r\nteach the English language to his alien captors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The “Invasion” of Washington, D.C._\r\n\r\nThe most famous of the radar phantoms are those that “invaded”\r\nWashington, D.C., on the nights of July 19 and July 26, 1952, and\r\nterrified a large number of radar operators, pilots, and Air Force\r\nofficials who in a more normal emotional climate would have recognized\r\nthe “invisible” flying saucers for what they were--radar angels\r\nproduced by weather conditions[VIII-2]. All during July the eastern\r\nseaboard had suffered an unprecedented drought and heat wave. Lack of\r\ncloud cover produced intensely hot days and rapid radiative cooling\r\nof the earth’s surface at night. This situation, combined with the\r\nprevailing light winds, was ideal for the formation of low-level\r\ntemperature inversions during the hours of darkness[VIII-5].\r\n\r\nThe hundreds of flying saucers reported during the summer (_Chapter_\r\nVII) had produced a state of near-panic which entered its acute phase\r\non July 19, at 11:40 P.M. E.D.S.T., when a group of seven unidentified\r\ntargets appeared on the radarscope of the Air Route Traffic Control\r\n(ARTC) at the Washington National Airport[VIII-3, p. 209 ff.]. Similar\r\ntargets that moved erratically, appearing and disappearing, were\r\nobserved on the radars of the control tower and of nearby Andrews Air\r\nForce Base. If the blips were to be accepted at face value, then a\r\nhost of aerial objects had invaded Washington and were cruising over\r\nthe White House and the Capitol. Traffic control notified the pilots\r\nof commercial flights in the area to keep alert for unidentified\r\naircraft. Some pilots reported unusual echoes on their plane radars,\r\nsome reported only normal returns, and two pilots reported unexplained\r\nlights in the neighborhood indicated by radar. Nobody saw any strange\r\naircraft. After several requests from ARTC (which unaccountably did not\r\nnotify officials in the Air Force Intelligence that an “invasion” was\r\ntaking place), a jet interceptor finally arrived about dawn to search\r\nthe area but found nothing. Meanwhile the targets had vanished from the\r\nradarscopes.\r\n\r\nNext day the report flashed all over the world that a fleet of flying\r\nsaucers had invaded Washington, and public tension became almost\r\ntangible. Was the earth doomed? The terror reached its climax on July\r\n26, just a week after the first incident, when at 10:30 P.M., E.D.S.T.,\r\nthe same radar operators who had observed the first “invasion” picked\r\nup another group of mysterious blips on their screens. The host of\r\nunknowns had apparently formed a ring around the city of Washington and\r\nthe surrounding countryside. This time Air Force Intelligence officers\r\nwere notified. They raced to the airport to see the radarscopes for\r\nthemselves, and concluded that real saucers must be in the sky. All\r\ncommercial air traffic was then diverted from Washington, reporters\r\nand photographers were barred from the radar room, and Air Force jets\r\ntook to the air to defend the nation. But against what? The enemy, if\r\nthere, was invisible. One pilot saw a bright light that vanished when\r\nhe began to chase it; later, his radar showed a return that faded after\r\na few seconds, but he could not find a visual target. In the hours\r\nbetween midnight and dawn, jet interceptors scoured the skies looking\r\nfor mysterious objects that produced returns on ground radar but not on\r\nplane radar, and were invisible to the human eye. They found nothing.\r\n\r\nOne pilot who flew this mission, accompanied by a copilot who was also\r\na radar officer, later described his experience:\r\n\r\n“For a period of 1½ hours the B-25 was vectored at altitudes varying\r\nfrom 1,000 to 4,000 feet MSL to the objects observed on the [ground\r\nradar] screen. The airplane flew circles around stationary blips, flew\r\nthrough and along with their formations, paralleled their flight, and\r\nwas observed in the radar screen to pass directly over, under, or\r\nthrough an angel. At all times the echo return of the aircraft caused a\r\nbrighter return on the screen than the angel. The radar height finder\r\nwas not operating during this mission, so exact altitudes of the blips\r\ncould not be determined.\r\n\r\n“No unidentified objects were observed by me or the crew during the\r\nflight. At 2300 E.D.S.T. all angels disappeared from the radar screen\r\nand screen detection returned to normal.”[VIII-6]\r\n\r\nBy dawn this fantastic war of the angels had ended and the post-mortems\r\nhad begun. One radar expert who kept his head in spite of the hysteria\r\nwas Captain Roy James of ATIC, who immediately recognized the targets\r\nas caused by weather. A civilian expert on radio propagation, when\r\nconsulted, correctly identified the phantoms and explained how they\r\nwere produced[VIII-7, VIII-7a]. General Samford, then in charge\r\nof the UFO investigation, concurred. But most newspapers and many\r\ngovernment officials, influenced by the general excitement, ignored the\r\nconclusions of the experts. Saucer enthusiasts regarded the phenomena\r\nas a real invasion from space, and alleged that the Air Force was\r\ncovering up the truth.\r\n\r\nWeeks passed before the facts of the incidents could be separated from\r\nthe fancies. Three ground radars had observed unusual targets on the\r\nnights of the “invasion.” Only once, however, did all three observe\r\nwhat was apparently the same target, and that for a few seconds only.\r\nThe unusual radar echoes had no visual counterpart--nobody had seen\r\nor heard a spaceship. A few pilots had reported unidentified lights,\r\nbut the Washington area at night displays thousands of lights, and\r\neven an unexplained light is far from being a spaceship. One pilot who\r\ntook part in this phantom war reported that, again and again, ground\r\nradar had vectored him in toward a target that proved to be a steamboat\r\nmaking a moonlight trip on the Potomac!\r\n\r\n\r\n_Radar Experiments in Washington_\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Washington crisis, the Technical Development and\r\nEvaluation Center of the Civil Aeronautics Authority was assigned the\r\nproblem of finding out exactly what had produced the radar returns.\r\nInvestigation showed that the phantoms were not a new or unusual\r\nphenomenon. They had appeared on the Washington radars on many nights\r\nbefore the first “invasion,” appeared twice during the week between\r\nthe two, and many times after the second. Abnormal returns are\r\ncommonplace during the hot summer months when temperature inversions\r\nand inequalities in the moisture of the air are most frequent. On the\r\nnights of July 19 and 26 the Weather Bureau at Washington recorded\r\nsmall temperature inversions and an abnormal distribution of moisture\r\nin the atmosphere, conditions that regularly produce radar angels.\r\n\r\nThe experts also carried out a series of experiments in the Washington\r\narea on several nights in August when conditions of temperature and\r\nhumidity closely resembled those on the “invasion” nights. During\r\nthese experiments unidentified targets appeared in profusion on the\r\nradar screens. The first observation period began on the evening of\r\nAugust 13, 1952. At about 9 P.M. E.D.S.T., suddenly “a group of seven\r\nstrong stationary targets became visible in an area about fifteen miles\r\nnorth-northeast of the radar antenna. During the next two or three\r\nantenna revolutions, the area on the scope between Washington and\r\nBaltimore became heavily sprinkled with stationary targets in a belt\r\nabout six miles wide. A group of additional targets became visible in\r\nan area approximately ten to fifteen miles south of the radar antenna.\r\nThis was evidence of the beginning of a temperature inversion.”[VIII-6]\r\nTwo temperature inversions were involved, one just above the earth’s\r\nsurface, and one at about 8000 feet. The investigators concluded that\r\nthe unidentified targets observed on Washington MEW (Microwave Early\r\nWarning) and other radar in the summer of 1952 were to be attributed\r\nto secondary reflections of the radar beam, caused primarily by\r\ntemperature inversions[VIII-5].\r\n\r\nSaucer enthusiasts protested (and still insist) that the inversions\r\nwere not large enough to produce radar anomalies, revealing how\r\nsuperficial was their acquaintance with radar. Although pronounced\r\ntemperature inversions are responsible for the superior and inferior\r\nmirages resulting from the bending of light rays, large inversions\r\nare not required to produce the mirages resulting from the refractive\r\nbending of radio waves. At radar frequencies, refraction is influenced\r\nby both temperature differences and the distribution of water vapor\r\nin the atmosphere. A pronounced drop in moisture content at higher\r\naltitudes can easily cause radar rays to bend earthward and pick\r\nup ground targets, even though temperature conditions in the lower\r\natmosphere are entirely normal.\r\n\r\nIn December 1952, _True_ magazine published a sensational article that\r\nattacked the Air Force findings, insisted that the radar echoes had\r\nbeen caused by strange machines and, in effect, accused the official\r\ninvestigators of releasing an explanation they knew to be at variance\r\nwith the facts shown by radar[VIII-8].\r\n\r\nDr. Vernon G. Plank, now at the Aerophysics Laboratory of the Air Force\r\nCambridge Research Center, was at that time Radar Meteorologist at\r\nWalpole, Massachusetts. A specialist in the science of radar, Dr. Plank\r\nhad made a detailed study of the refractive conditions prevailing\r\nover Washington for July 20 and 21, 1952. In a letter (which was never\r\npublished) to the editor of _True_, he pointed out that the saucer\r\ntheory of the Washington radar returns had no basis in fact. The\r\nmaterial given in the letter merits quotation:\r\n\r\n“The regular Washington radiosonde observations, when converted into\r\nrefractive index terms, reveal that a very marked superrefractive\r\ncondition (a condition favorable to earthward bending of radar rays)\r\nprevailed in the lower atmosphere during this period. The cause of this\r\nsuperrefractive condition was primarily the rapid decrease of water\r\nvapor with altitude.\r\n\r\n“Although this superrefractive layer was not quite intense enough to\r\ncause the radar rays to be bent completely back to earth, the rays\r\nwould be very markedly bent downward from their normal position.\r\nFrom past experience with other situations of this type it is to be\r\nexpected that certain regions in this layer might be considerably more\r\nsuperrefractive than others, or that particular terrain features, such\r\nas rivers or small bodies of water, might create local, transitory\r\nconditions favorable to extreme superrefraction or even reflection.\r\nAnother factor to consider is that whereas such local anomalies are\r\nusually due to moisture, localized temperature effects may also create\r\nor help create such intense superrefractive regions. Therefore,\r\nit would not be at all surprising that such local anomalies, when\r\nsuperimposed on the generally superrefractive layer already existing\r\nover Washington, could create a situation conducive to radar echoes of\r\nthe type observed.\r\n\r\n“Under such conditions the general ground clutter referred to in the\r\nKeyhoe article would not be present and the radarscope would only\r\nshow echoes whenever and ‘wherever’ (qualified below) a favorable\r\nsuperrefractive region occurred. As the radar ray has to travel from\r\nthe radar set to the particular region of refraction and thence onward\r\nto the ground, the scope echoes created by such disturbances would\r\noccur at an indicated range of roughly twice the disturbance range.\r\n\r\n“Even slow air movements within a localized disturbance (one\r\nsufficiently intense to bend the ray into the ground) would be\r\ntranslated into enormous movements of the echo over the scope face.\r\nBoth lateral and radial movements could be expected and disappearance\r\nof echo between sweeps would not be surprising.\r\n\r\n“Of course, the optical effects noted in conjunction with the radar\r\nechoes would depend upon temperature effects. However, the lack of a\r\ntemperature inversion in the type of data referred to by Mr. Keyhoe\r\ndoes not preclude the possibility that extremely sharp and localized\r\ninversions existed over the area, perhaps in close association or in\r\nconjunction with the regions causing the radar echo. The Weather Bureau\r\ndata cited are not sufficiently accurate nor do the instruments used\r\nin obtaining the data have a sufficiently rapid response to measure\r\nsuch small inversions. Also, such data are usually obtained at only two\r\ndefinite periods during each day.\r\n\r\n“As the distance between Andrews AFB and the Washington National\r\nAirport is only some few miles, the refractive effects of a given\r\ndisturbance might appear to be quite similar, and the position of the\r\nresulting ground echo on the two sets might coincide to a fair degree\r\nof approximation. However, as information about the degree of accuracy\r\nmaintained in plotting echo position is not available to me, I cannot\r\ncomment with any degree of intelligence. It does seem though, that\r\nwith the observed echo speeds and radical direction changes, as well\r\nas the echo appearance and disappearance phenomena, that accurate\r\nscope coordination between the separate fields would be extremely\r\ndifficult.”[VIII-9]\r\n\r\n\r\n_“Simultaneous” Radar-Visual Reports_\r\n\r\nOn the night of July 29, three days after the second Washington crisis,\r\nthe radar installation of the Air Defense Command post near Port\r\nHuron, Michigan, had been tracking three F-94s as they made practice\r\nruns on a B-25 bomber. At 9:40 P.M. C.S.T., ground control picked\r\nup an unidentified target moving from north to south at a speed of\r\nabout 625 miles an hour. The operators notified the pilot of one of\r\nthe F-94s and vectored him in for an attempted intercept. The plane’s\r\nradar did not show the reported target, but when the plane had climbed\r\nto a height of 21,000 feet, both the pilot and his radar man saw a\r\nbrilliant multicolored light, many times larger than a star, close to\r\nthe northern horizon. At the same time the plane’s radar picked up an\r\necho in the north; it disappeared after thirty seconds, although the\r\nlight was still visible dead ahead. As the pilot began the chase, the\r\nlight changed color from bluish white to reddish and slowly diminished\r\nin size as though it were moving away. The pilot pursued the light for\r\nabout half an hour without gaining on it, and eventually had to return\r\nto base. The ground radar, meanwhile, had been trying to keep track\r\nof events in the sky. When the chase began, the target appearing on\r\nground radar had first made a 180-degree turn and reversed direction\r\nfrom south to north; it had then moved erratically, doubling its speed\r\ninstantaneously, and then slowing down. It once seemed to reach a\r\nspeed of about 1400 miles an hour, then slowed to about 300 mph, and\r\ndisappeared from the scope shortly after the plane had returned to\r\nbase[VIII-2].\r\n\r\nTo many persons this incident seemed a simultaneous visual and radar\r\nsighting of a single unknown object but the Air Force soon demolished\r\nthis theory. A study of the facts revealed that the movement of the\r\nradar target and that of the mysterious light had not coincided. The\r\nradar target had traveled from north to south, had then reversed\r\ndirection, had slowed down, speeded up, and moved erratically. The\r\nlight, however, had remained steadily in the north, diminishing in size\r\nand brilliance but not vanishing. It behaved, in fact, like the image\r\nof a star or a planet seen through turbulent atmosphere (see _Chapter_\r\nIV).\r\n\r\nFor several nights before the sighting, many residents in this part\r\nof Michigan had noticed a similar light that appeared in the northern\r\nsky each evening at about the same time and place, displaying various\r\nchanging colors. The investigators were able to identify the shining\r\nunknown as the star Capella. The position of the lights coincided with\r\nthat of the star for that time, date, and latitude. Capella was at\r\nlower culmination--that is, at the lowest point of its swing around\r\nthe pole star, just skirting the horizon where its spectacular blue,\r\nyellow, and red twinkling is familiar to astronomers of the region.\r\nThe pilot’s description, and the fact that he could get no closer to\r\nit even after a thirty-minute chase, confirmed this identification.\r\nNeither the brief blip that appeared on the plane’s radar nor the\r\nerratic returns picked up by ground radar had any relation to the star;\r\nthey were merely phantom returns caused by weather conditions[VIII-2].\r\n\r\nLike this Michigan sighting, many UFO problems are difficult to solve\r\nbecause they result from more than one cause. The observations seem at\r\nfirst glance to refer to a single phenomenon, although actually two\r\nor more unrelated phenomena are involved. On August 1, 1952, two days\r\nafter the Michigan incident, such a puzzle arose with an impressive\r\nradar-visual-photographic sighting near Bellefontaine, Ohio[VIII-2].\r\nAt 10:45 A.M. C.D.S.T., the radar operator at the Air Defense Command\r\npost picked up an unidentified target north of Dayton, moving southwest\r\nat a speed of about 525 miles an hour. Two jets from Wright-Patterson\r\nAir Force Base were scrambled for an intercept and were vectored\r\nin by ground control. Since the ground radar was not equipped with\r\nheight-finding devices, however, the operator could not direct the\r\npilots to a specific altitude; he could only tell them whether they\r\nwere nearer to or farther from the target.\r\n\r\nWhen the jets had reached 30,000 feet, ground radar informed them\r\nthat they were almost on target, which was still moving southwest\r\nat the same speed. A few seconds later, the returns from the jets\r\nand the UFO blended on the radarscope and the operator advised the\r\npilots that they would have to continue the search visually. At this\r\nmoment, unfortunately, the ground radar suddenly failed. Soon after\r\ncommunication between ground and air had ended, the lead pilot observed\r\na silver-colored sphere several thousand feet above him. Both jets went\r\nafter it but although they climbed to their maximum altitude, 40,000\r\nfeet, neither could get close enough to identify the object, which\r\nwas still some 30,000 feet above them. One pilot, however, managed to\r\nexpose several feet of film with his gun camera. At the same moment the\r\nwarning light on his gunsight radar blinked on to indicate it detected\r\na solid object. At this point the jets broke off the intercept and\r\nstarted back to Wright-Patterson Field.\r\n\r\nBoth pilots then realized that, although they had been chasing an\r\nunknown for some ten minutes, they were still northwest of the base\r\nin almost the same area where they had started the intercept. This\r\nsurprising fact seemed to indicate that the unknown had slowed down\r\nfrom its original speed of 525 miles an hour, to hover in the sky\r\nnearly motionless.\r\n\r\nIn flying saucer circles, this series of events was regarded as an\r\niron-clad case of a physically material UFO observed simultaneously by\r\nradar, the human eye, and the camera.\r\n\r\nAfter sifting the evidence, ATIC investigators eventually found the\r\nmore prosaic though complicated solution to the puzzle:\r\n\r\n1) The object picked up on ground radar had actually been a jet plane,\r\nflying out of Cleveland. It had not been identified immediately because\r\nthe Bellefontaine station had not received its flight plan. At 10:45\r\nthat morning the jet had been north of Dayton, flying at low altitude\r\non a southwest heading, at a speed of around 525 miles an hour--the\r\nexact time, position, and speed of the radar unknown.\r\n\r\n2) The pilots of the interceptors never saw this jet. What they saw,\r\nwhat their gun radar detected, and what their gun camera photographed\r\nwas a twenty-foot radiosonde balloon that had been released from\r\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base that morning shortly before the\r\nsighting. Ground radar, on the other hand, never picked up the balloon.\r\n\r\n3) The chief reason for the confusion was that ground radar did not\r\nhave a height-finding device. When the operator notified the pilots\r\nthat his scope showed a blending of the returns produced by the pursuit\r\njets and by the unknown, neither he nor the pilots had any way to tell\r\nwhether the unknown was directly above or directly below the pursuing\r\njets. At 30,000 feet the pilots were too high to see the Cleveland jet\r\nfar below them. But they did see the balloon above them and naturally\r\nassumed that it was the object they were supposed to be chasing.\r\n\r\n4) Since the ground radar stopped functioning at this point, the\r\noperator could no longer track the course of the unknown or of the\r\ninterceptors. If the radar had been working, he would have seen that\r\nthe target continued on to the southwest while the interceptors were\r\nsearching in a different area to the north.\r\n\r\n5) The photographs confirmed this reconstruction of a complicated\r\nseries of events. The pictures obtained by the gun camera displayed a\r\nround, indistinct blur. Analysis showed that the size of the object was\r\nthat of a twenty-foot sphere--a balloon--photographed from a distance\r\nof 30,000 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_“Ghosts” and “Angels” on Radar_\r\n\r\nEvery experienced radar man has observed blips on his scope that he\r\ncannot account for[VIII-4], but he recognizes many characteristics of\r\nthese “ghosts” or “angels.” They often come from an apparently clear\r\nand normal sky. They are usually concentrated in the lower atmosphere,\r\nare weak in character, and last only a short time. Although they may\r\noccur at any time of the year, they appear most often on summer nights\r\nin calm weather[VIII-10]. Summer atmospheric conditions, in which the\r\nair is relatively quiet but varies in temperature and moisture content,\r\nhave an adverse effect on radio and radar transmission and produce many\r\nof these ghost returns.\r\n\r\nThe uneven distribution of temperature and humidity in the atmosphere\r\nis only one of the many possible causes of the radar angels often\r\nlabeled as saucers[VIII-11, VIII-12]. These ghosts may be produced by\r\npeculiar atmospheric conditions, back and forward scatter of radio\r\nwaves[VIII-13], smoke, wind-carried debris, moisture-laden clouds, ice\r\ncrystals in clouds or air, lightning, meteors, the Aurora Borealis,\r\nbirds, insects, bats, electronic reflections from the moon, flares on\r\nthe sun, or by “chaff” or “window” (foil dropped from airplanes). A\r\nradar operator once picked up a group of phantom echoes that seemed\r\nto form the letters “GI” which, according to the scope, apparently\r\nstretched over a distance of about eighty miles. He tracked them for\r\ntwo hours, but gave up trying to interpret the message when he learned\r\nthat it was produced by chaff dropped from an Air Force plane during an\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nAn extremely unusual pattern of “angels” (see Plate IVc) appeared\r\non the radarscope at Schilling Air Force Base at Salina, Kansas,\r\non September 10, 1956, and was attributed to forward scatter from\r\natmospheric eddies to ground targets and back[VIII-13].\r\n\r\nMany radar angels are caused by insects and birds. Their detection on\r\nsensitive, high-resolution, Q-, K-, and X-band radars has been verified\r\nboth observationally and theoretically. Since a radar set surveys\r\na very large volume of the atmosphere and maps it on a relatively\r\nsmall dial, a surprisingly small concentration of insects can cause\r\nappreciable clutter on the scope. On sets such as the 0.86-cm TPQ-6\r\n(Cloud Base and Top Indicator), a single insect of detectable size\r\nin a volume of 100,000 cubic feet of air is enough to fill the scope\r\nwith return[VIII-4]. Since the guilty insect would be invisible both\r\nto ground observers and to the crew of pursuing jets, a flying-saucer\r\nreport inspired by the radar echoes would remain forever an “Unknown.”\r\n\r\nBirds can cause substantial echoes on many radars. Large birds at a\r\ndistance of ten miles can give signals equivalent to those from a\r\nmedium-sized aircraft at a distance of fifty miles; in fact, even the\r\nfading and fluctuation resemble those of aircraft echoes. On radar,\r\na sea gull may cause a return equivalent to that of a quart of water\r\nflying around. The radar cross section of the blip may be several\r\ntimes larger than the geometric cross section of the bird, so that a\r\nsingle adult sea gull at a distance of twenty nautical miles gives\r\na very large radar return. As few as eight birds per square mile\r\ncan completely fill a PPI (Planned Position Indicator) scope with\r\nreturn[VIII-14]. If conditions were exactly right, the birds might\r\nbe visible to an observer and the source of the angel would thus be\r\nexplained. But if no one happened to see the birds, the “mysterious”\r\nreturns could serve as a basis for still another report of invisible\r\nflying saucers.\r\n\r\nBirds have also been responsible for some of the “ring” angels that\r\nhave been interpreted as fleets of invisible spaceships. In September\r\n1953 several radar sites in England picked up unidentified objects\r\napparently encircling the city of London. They performed peculiar\r\nmaneuvers including, according to one saucer publication, the formation\r\nof the letters Z and U of the English alphabet. How the correct\r\norientation of this invisible sky writing was determined has never been\r\nexplained. If the letters are turned top to bottom, back to front, or\r\nrotated 90 or 180 degrees, they take on new meanings. Scholars might\r\nwell argue about whether the first giant symbol should be interpreted\r\nas a Roman Z, a Roman N, a Greek Ζ, or a Russian И; and whether the\r\nsecond symbol should be read as a Roman U, a Greek Ω, the mathematical\r\nsymbol ⊂ standing for “is contained in,” or a Roman C lying on its side.\r\n\r\nOn the scope, ring angels produce outwardly expanding rings and arcs\r\nthat sometimes move on and off the screen at incredible speeds. Such\r\nechoes have been a fairly common phenomenon in England since 1940 and\r\n1941[VIII-15], and experimental research has shown that many of those\r\noccurring at dawn or at dusk are caused by flocks of starlings. At dawn\r\nthousands of starlings leave the roost in waves at intervals of about\r\nhalf a minute. The birds in each wave are often closely packed in a\r\ntight circle or semicircle as the wave ascends. All are flying outward,\r\ndispersing in all directions, so that the ring diffuses rapidly on the\r\nradar screen and disappears, but is followed almost at once by a new\r\nring. At dusk the birds may return separately to the roost during the\r\ncourse of an hour. Sometimes, however, they assemble first in a field\r\nsome distance from the roost; they finally take off at the same time\r\nas a group and head for the roost in a single giant wave, causing a\r\ntremendously impressive but quickly vanishing angel on the radarscope.\r\n\r\nRing echoes observed at Texarkana, Arkansas, have been traced to the\r\nmovements of red-winged blackbirds. Thousands of birds flying out from\r\na common roosting ground a few minutes before sunrise show up on the\r\nPPI scope as an expanding ring that grows broader and more diffuse with\r\ntime until the composite echo breaks into individual ones and fades at\r\na distance of twelve to thirty-five miles[VIII-16].\r\n\r\nOther types of ring angels have been observed on radarscopes, but the\r\ncauses are not yet fully understood[VIII-17, VIII-18].\r\n\r\nRecognizing the true character of these radar angels and spurious\r\nreflections has tremendous importance for the security of the United\r\nStates. Our Early Warning System, designed to notify Air Defense of\r\nimminent attacks by intercontinental ballistic missiles, has already\r\nhad troubles with such radar ghosts. On October 5, 1960, a signal from\r\nThule, Greenland, to the North American Air Defense Command flashed\r\nthe warning, “Massive ICBM attack is underway.” The Canadian officer\r\nin charge had only seventeen minutes in which to decide whether to\r\norder several hundred bombers of the Strategic Air Command to retaliate\r\nagainst the USSR or to push the button that would cause our long-range\r\nmissiles with atomic warheads to come roaring out of their underground\r\nsites. He immediately asked Washington: Where was Khrushchev?\r\nKhrushchev was in New York at the United Nations: the officer did not\r\npush the button that would have set the world at war.\r\n\r\nLater, he learned that radar beams reflected from the moon had produced\r\nthe terrifying angels. This incident is only one of the reasons why the\r\nAir Force continues to be interested in radar UFOs. Failure to identify\r\nthem correctly could threaten the effectiveness of our patrol system.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Rapid City Sighting_\r\n\r\nOne of the most complex incidents in saucer history occurred early\r\nin August 1953 near Rapid City, South Dakota. Like the sightings the\r\nprevious year at Bellefontaine, Ohio, and Port Huron, Michigan, the\r\npresence of a UFO seemed to be confirmed by several types of evidence.\r\nTrained civilian and military personnel on the ground and in the air\r\nobserved an unknown visually and by radar. The blips on the ground\r\nradarscope were photographed and a plane’s gun camera took a picture.\r\nIf a similar incident were to occur today, Air Force investigators\r\nwould probably find the answer without difficulty. In 1953, however,\r\nthey were less experienced and finally classified the case as “one of\r\nthe best” Unknowns.\r\n\r\nIt is clearly impossible to solve the mystery with absolute certainty\r\nafter nearly ten years, because vital information is lacking. The\r\noriginal records are no longer on file. Few details are available\r\nexcept those in Ruppelt’s sketchy summary[VIII-3, p. 303 ff.], and\r\nsome of these are inaccurate: the town of Black Hawk, for example, is\r\nnot west, but northwest, of Rapid City. Although many questions of fact\r\nmust therefore remain unanswered--exact times, directions, sequence of\r\nevents--we offer here a highly probable explanation.\r\n\r\nThe first report came at 8:05 P.M. M.S.T. when a spotter for the Ground\r\nObserver Corps in the town of Black Hawk telephoned the Air Defense\r\nCommand post near Rapid City, approximately ten miles southeast of\r\nBlack Hawk, to report an extremely bright light hovering low on the\r\nhorizon to the northeast. The radar operators at Ellsworth Air Force\r\nBase had been working with a jet patrol flying west of the base. After\r\nreceiving the phone call, they shifted the scope to scan the northeast\r\nquadrant of the sky and picked up an unidentified target moving slowly\r\nat about 16,000 feet. Although the controller wondered at first whether\r\nthe target might have been due to weather, he decided after a few\r\nminutes that it was well defined, solid, and bright.\r\n\r\nSince the ground spotter had a visual target and the traffic controller\r\nhad a radar target, he telephoned to compare notes on positions; as\r\nthey were talking, the spotter interrupted the conversation to say that\r\nthe light was beginning to move southwest toward Rapid City. Checking\r\nthe radarscope and finding a fast-moving target the controller sent two\r\nof his men running outside to look at the sky. After a few seconds they\r\nreported that they could see a large bluish-white light moving toward\r\nthem from the northeast. It made “a wide sweep” around Rapid City and\r\nthen returned to a stationary position in the northeast where it had\r\nfirst appeared. (Unfortunately the account does not state clearly\r\nwhether the “wide sweep” was observed visually or on radar.)\r\n\r\nBy this time all the witnesses were greatly excited by the UFO. The\r\nmaster sergeant couldn’t decide what to do next because he kept\r\nthinking, “They’re bigger than all of us!” but the traffic controller\r\nnotified the F-84 patrolling in the west and asked for an intercept.\r\nThe pilot soon found the light, which was still stationary. He began\r\nthe chase, but when he had approached to within an estimated three\r\nmiles, the light rapidly began to retreat. He continued the chase\r\ndirectly north for 120 miles (during which both the jet and the UFO\r\nwent off the ground scope) but he could not gain on the object. Running\r\nshort of fuel, he turned back toward the base. The ground scope soon\r\npicked him up again and, a few seconds later, picked up an unknown\r\ntarget apparently trailing the jet by ten or fifteen miles.\r\n\r\nA second jet then took to the air, located the light, and began the\r\npursuit. Like the first pilot, he could not close the distance between\r\nhim and the receding UFO. After performing various tests to convince\r\nhimself that he wasn’t chasing a reflection, he finally turned on\r\nhis radar gun camera. After a few seconds the red light blinked on,\r\nindicating a solid object ahead. The pilot thereupon asked permission\r\nto break off the intercept and, having taken a photograph, returned\r\nto base. As before, the ground scope picked up the returning jet but\r\nthis time the UFO did not reappear on the scope. The controller then\r\ncalled officials at the filter center at Fargo, North Dakota. They\r\nhad not received any UFO reports; a few minutes later, however, they\r\ncalled back to say that spotter posts between the two cities, on a\r\nsouthwest-northeast line, had indeed seen a bluish-white light.\r\n\r\nInvestigators from ATIC arrived promptly but they were not able to\r\nexplain the sighting. Even the photographs showed nothing useful.\r\nConclusion: unknown.\r\n\r\nThe incident remained unexplained chiefly because the investigators,\r\nlike the witnesses, apparently assumed that a single unidentified\r\nflying object accounted for all the phenomena observed that evening.\r\nAlthough the available evidence is somewhat confusing, a careful study\r\nshows that, on the contrary, the visual and the radar targets could not\r\nhave been the same.\r\n\r\nWhen the ground spotter first reported the UFO, she described it as a\r\nstationary light low on the horizon. The radarscope, however, showed\r\na target that was moving slowly, at an altitude of about 16,000 feet.\r\nSome minutes later, when the visual target did begin to move, the radar\r\ntarget speeded up. This was the only instance in which the movements\r\nof the two seemed to be roughly parallel. But in the excitement\r\nthat followed, all the witnesses assumed that the two targets were\r\nidentical. The published account[VIII-3, p. 303 ff.] does not\r\ndistinguish clearly between the actions of the light and the movements\r\nof the blips on the radarscope.\r\n\r\nLet us begin by reviewing the facts about the visual target. According\r\nto the witnesses on the ground, it was a brilliant bluish-white light\r\nthat appeared on the northeast horizon and remained stationary during\r\nmost of the period it was observed. At one time it seemed to advance\r\nrapidly toward the witnesses, make a wide sweep around Rapid City,\r\nwhich was a few miles away from the observers, and then return to\r\nits original position. According to the witnesses in the air, the\r\nlight did not remain stationary but retreated from the pursuing plane\r\nand followed the returning plane, duplicating the plane’s speed and\r\nkeeping the distance between them constant. The pilots based this\r\ninterpretation, evidently, on the fact that the light did not vary in\r\nsize or brilliance and thus seemed to pace the plane.\r\n\r\nThese descriptions all point to the same answer: that the light was a\r\nstar or a planet. Since it was infinitely distant, the jets could not\r\nget any closer to it and at ground levels the image was distorted by\r\npeculiar atmospheric conditions. Mars had been absent from the night\r\nsky for months, and Mercury, Venus, and Jupiter were then morning\r\nstars; therefore the unknown could not have been a planet. However,\r\nthe bright star Capella was on the northeast horizon at a declination\r\nof plus 46 degrees and would have been visible from both Fargo and\r\nRapid City. A check of the Weather Bureau records shows that the night\r\nwas clear and dark. The sun had set about an hour before the sighting\r\nbegan, and at that time in the evening there was no moonlight because\r\nthe moon was in its last quarter. Visibility was about thirty-five\r\nmiles and the wind was from the northeast, about four meters per\r\nsecond. There was a marked temperature inversion--9 degrees--at ground\r\nlevels. Such an inversion could easily account for the erratic motions\r\nreported for the light.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the visual target was the star Capella.\r\n\r\nThe radar targets also were clearly the result of weather, just as the\r\nair-traffic controller had suspected when he first looked at the scope.\r\nConditions were ideal--a calm, clear, warm summer night--for phantom\r\nechoes. The first radar target, moving southwest, was probably a return\r\nfrom some ground object. When the jet took to the air, the scope showed\r\na different kind of UFO target, one that echoed the movements of the\r\nplane itself--retreating from the pursuer, advancing when the pursuer\r\nturned back--and was always farther away from the ground station than\r\nthe plane itself.\r\n\r\nAlthough saucer enthusiasts interpret these maneuvers as proof that\r\nthe phantom was under intelligent control, radar experts recognize the\r\nfamiliar pattern in which a ghost echo is actually a return from the\r\nplane itself. Because of the temperature inversions the radar pulses\r\ndo not return directly from the plane to the ground receiver but are\r\ndeflected from the plane to the ground, then back to the plane, and\r\nthence on to the ground scope. The phantom echo always occurs from the\r\nsame direction as the aircraft and is always “on the other side” of the\r\nplane (see p. 153).\r\n\r\nThis explanation also accounts for the evidence of the jet’s gun\r\ncamera. The photographs taken showed nothing, although the radar\r\nwarning light indicated a solid object ahead. After the pilot had\r\nswitched on the set, however, there had been a brief delay before the\r\nred signal blinked on. During this interval the plane had not come any\r\ncloser to the unknown light, but the radio waves had scattered from\r\nplane to ground and back to plane so that the gun radar did indeed\r\ndetect a solid object--the plane itself!\r\n\r\nIn short, the evidence supports our conclusion that an image of the\r\nstar Capella, distorted by the atmospheric conditions produced by a\r\nstrong temperature inversion, accounted for the visual sightings;\r\nand that radar echoes from the pursuing jets, deflected by the same\r\ntemperature inversion, accounted for the phantom targets on the ground\r\nradarscope and the gun radar.\r\n\r\n[VIII-1] Keyhoe, D.

Paracelsus believed that he could use a magnet to draw\r\ndisease out from a person, transfer it to the ground, and thus cure\r\nthe patient. Later practitioners believed that a sick person could\r\nregain his health by sleeping with head and feet oriented north to\r\nsouth so as to be in line with the earth’s magnetic poles. Laputa,\r\nthe saucer-shaped floating island visited by Gulliver in his travels,\r\nwas propelled by the attracting or repelling forces of a large magnet\r\nimbedded in the center of the island. In recent years magnetism has\r\nsimilarly been called on to account for some of the peculiar maneuvers\r\nallegedly performed by UFOs.\r\n\r\nIn the world of flying saucers an all-purpose electromagnetic (E-M)\r\nforce, unknown to earth scientists, is supposed to be able to produce\r\nlight and heat, disturb a compass, render an object radioactive, stop a\r\nwrist watch without damaging the man who wears it, interfere with the\r\nfunctioning of radio and TV sets, turn out the lights of automobiles,\r\nstop the action of gasoline engines, and aid in the creating of\r\nartificial gravitational fields (G-fields) around extraterrestrial\r\nspaceships.\r\n\r\nUFOs equipped with E-M powers have occasionally been reported in\r\nFrance since 1954[IX-1], but they had rarely appeared in the United\r\nStates until late in 1957 when freak weather in Texas, plus the birth\r\nof the space age, started a new wave of flying-saucer incidents. Few\r\nspectacular UFOs had appeared since the 1952 panic (_Chapter_ VII) and\r\nthe average citizen had almost forgotten about flying saucers. Then on\r\nOctober 4, 1957, when Sputnik I went into orbit and opened the door\r\nto outer space, people once more began to watch the heavens uneasily.\r\nUneasiness became alarm a month later when, with American satellites\r\nstill sitting on the launching pad, Sputnik II roared into space. A\r\nball of fire floating over a field in western Texas provided the small\r\nstimulus needed to turn alarm into hysteria, and for several weeks\r\npeople tended to see spaceships in every cloud and every unfamiliar\r\nlight in the sky. The reasoning seemed to be that if man with his\r\nlimited powers could launch satellites to orbit the planet, why\r\nshouldn’t interplanetary ships already be visiting the earth?\r\n\r\nIn the months of November and December the Air Force received more UFO\r\nreports than during the entire ten months preceding, and the reports\r\nhad their highest frequency in the single week following November\r\n2[IX-2]. For a period of about eight days, if all the stories were\r\ntrue, our skies were crowded with flying saucers.\r\n\r\nSpaceships with electromagnetic powers roved from the Dominican\r\nRepublic to Alaska; they stopped automobiles, turned off headlights,\r\njammed radios and stopped clocks in cars, blurred TV sets in the home,\r\ndimmed the cabin lights in airplanes, and altered a speedometer to\r\nregister a dangerously high speed instead of the legal sixty miles per\r\nhour. (Whether the driver in question offered this novel defense to a\r\njudge in traffic court is unknown.) Police in squad cars pursued UFOs\r\nin Elmwood Park, Illinois; Danville, Illinois; and Hammond, Indiana. In\r\nBrazil, an orange-colored, whistling UFO hovered near Fort Itaipu and\r\nfirst caused a temporary failure of the lights, then knocked out the\r\ngenerating plant for several moments. A driver in Santa Fe, New Mexico,\r\nsaw a UFO that not only stalled his car but also stopped the dashboard\r\nclock and the driver’s own wrist watch. A driver in western Texas saw\r\na UFO that, not content with stopping the engine and radio of his car,\r\nalso magnetized the right half of the bumper and a part of the fender.\r\nOne driver reported that his car and those of several other motorists\r\nhad stalled near Cortez, Colorado; he had not thought of looking at the\r\nsky, but any saucer enthusiast could have told him that a UFO must have\r\nbeen hovering there.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these special models equipped with Medusa-like powers,\r\nother spaceships allegedly landed briefly at the military installation\r\nat White Sands, New Mexico; harassed a United States Coast Guard ship\r\nin the Gulf of Mexico; landed in Ohio and raised the radioactivity\r\nlevel of the ground; and stopped in Nebraska for repairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stormy Weather in Texas_\r\n\r\nThe new type of UFO with electromagnetic (E-M) powers first attracted\r\nnotice in this country by allegedly appearing near Levelland, Texas, on\r\nthe night of November 2, 1957, a few hours before Sputnik II went into\r\norbit. A small town with a population of about 8000, Levelland lies on\r\nthe plains of western Texas about sixty miles from Plainview, site of\r\na famous meteor shower, and only twenty-five miles from Lubbock, which\r\na few years earlier had gained national fame with its “Lubbock lights”\r\n(p. 123). The region is normally an arid one, but at the beginning\r\nof November it was experiencing unusual weather--electrical storms\r\nand rain (the month proved to be the wettest ever recorded in western\r\nTexas).\r\n\r\nAbout 11:15 that Saturday night, a farmworker named Pedro Saucedo (or\r\nSaucido) with his friend Joe Palaz (also given in various printed\r\naccounts as Palav, Salav, Salaz, Salvaz) was driving home from\r\nLevelland. A few miles northwest of the town he had turned off Route\r\n116 into a side road, when both men noticed a flash of light in a field\r\nat the right. Evidently unalarmed, he continued driving and talking\r\nuntil suddenly the engine died and the lights went out. While trying\r\nto restart the motor, Saucedo (the similarity between “Saucedo” and\r\n“saucer” presents a diverting coincidence) glimpsed over his left\r\nshoulder something that looked like a flaming ball or a fiery tornado\r\ndrifting rapidly toward the truck. A veteran of combat in Korea,\r\nSaucedo reacted instantaneously to the blazing unknown. As he described\r\nthe experience later that night, “I jumped out of the truck and hit the\r\ndirt because I was afraid. I called to Joe but he didn’t get out. The\r\nthing passed directly over my truck with a great sound and a rush of\r\nwind. It sounded like thunder and my truck rocked from the flash.... I\r\nfelt a lot of heat.” Crawling out and seeing the object disappear in\r\nthe direction of Levelland, he restarted the engine and drove back to\r\nLevelland to report the incident to the sheriff[IX-2].\r\n\r\nThe sheriff was soon receiving reports from other persons who had been\r\ndriving in the same area at about the same time. They said that they,\r\ntoo, had seen a blazing object which they described as a “flying egg”\r\nor “egg-shaped fireball.” Their cars, like Saucedo’s, had stalled and\r\nthen restarted when the object disappeared. A number of townspeople\r\ntelephoned the authorities to report bright flashes in the sky, and the\r\npolice comment that “everyone who called was very excited”[IX-3] was\r\nprobably an understatement.\r\n\r\nUnder headlines such as “Mystery Object Stalls Autos in West Texas,”\r\nthese stories hit newspapers all over the nation. The news spread fast.\r\nAll day Sunday dozens of persons in Texas and New Mexico were relating\r\nthat they, too, had seen fiery objects and flashes of light in the sky\r\nthe night before. An amazingly large number of citizens seem to have\r\nbeen out late that stormy Saturday night, but apparently none of them\r\nnoticed any ordinary lightning--only phantom “somethings” variously\r\ndescribed as a burning mass, a big light, an egg-shaped object 200 feet\r\nlong lighted up as though it were on fire, something like neon lights,\r\nobjects that were red, glowing, brilliant, fiery, bluish-green, or\r\npulsating green.\r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, with all this publicity, the original incident\r\nquickly began to take on new dimensions. Saucedo amplified his first\r\nstatements and recalled that the object had been “torpedo-shaped,”\r\n“like a rocket, but much larger,” and that lights on the object had\r\nseemed to be winking on and off[IX-4].\r\n\r\nFor days the Russian satellites had to share the spotlight with the\r\nAmerican flying eggs, while both amateur and professional investigators\r\ntried to solve the mystery. The proponents of UFOs deduced the presence\r\nof a flying saucer with E-M powers. Various astronomers, when urged\r\nby newsmen, reluctantly advanced off-the-cuff theories based on the\r\nmeager printed accounts. Dr. La Paz, of the Institute of Meteoritics\r\nin New Mexico, suggested that the things seen at Levelland might\r\nhave been fireballs. A reporter assigned to the Harvard-Smithsonian\r\nObservatories to cover Moonwatch observations of the new Sputnik gave\r\na sketchy summary of the incident to Dr. Menzel, who also concluded\r\nthat Saucedo might have seen an unusually bright meteor and, startled\r\nby its brilliance, might accidentally have killed the engine. Lacking\r\nnews of Sputnik II, the reporter sent in a facetious story asserting\r\nthat, according to the director of the Harvard College Observatory,\r\nthe flying eggs were mirages that so frightened the drivers that they\r\nreacted by pressing a “nervous foot” on the accelerator and killing\r\nthe engine. When the weather conditions at Levelland became known, of\r\ncourse, the meteor theory was immediately discarded. Dr. Nininger,\r\nof the American Meteorite Museum in Arizona, made the best guess of\r\nall: Saucedo had observed an example of that rare phenomenon, ball\r\nlightning[IX-5].\r\n\r\nWithin a few days an Air Force investigator visited Levelland to study\r\nthe incident. Members of civilian saucer groups complained later that,\r\nsince he spent only seven hours in the area, he had obviously not taken\r\nthe problem seriously and could not have found the correct solution.\r\nEven seventy hours of labor, however, could not have produced a clearer\r\npicture. Saucedo had unquestionably had a frightening experience, very\r\nmuch as he originally described it. But as in many UFO sightings,\r\nmost of the other reports had been stimulated chiefly by the general\r\nexcitement. Three persons, not “dozens,” had seen the phenomenon near\r\nthe ground. From ten to fifteen others (including the sheriff) had not\r\nobserved it at close quarters but had merely seen brilliant flashes of\r\nlight in the sky.\r\n\r\nAfter studying the weather reports and the descriptions given by the\r\nvarious witnesses, the Air Force issued an explanation, unfortunately\r\nambiguous because it omitted the necessary word “either,” stating that\r\nthe phenomenon observed at Levelland had been “ball lightning or St.\r\nElmo’s fire.” Supporters of the saucer theory seized on this ambiguity\r\nto protest, correctly, that ball lightning and St. Elmo’s fire are\r\ntwo different phenomena. They went on to conclude by some process of\r\npeculiar logic that neither ball lightning nor St. Elmo’s fire was\r\ninvolved and that the phenomenon had actually been a flying saucer.\r\n\r\nSaucer publications have printed thousands of words to support this\r\nargument. The evidence, however, leads to an overwhelming probability:\r\nthe fiery unknown at Levelland was ball lightning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Phenomenon of Ball Lightning_\r\n\r\nMost of us know very little about lightning. On the average, it causes\r\nsome 180 deaths each year. Many persons when caught outdoors by a\r\nthunderstorm run to shelter under a tree, not realizing that the tree\r\nitself offers the most attractive target to the electrically charged\r\nclouds overhead. Even the scientists who make a special study of the\r\nphenomenon still have much to learn about the conditions that produce\r\nlightning and its various manifestations[IX-6].\r\n\r\nThe most familiar type is the lightning we see in stormy weather;\r\nit flashes in brilliant zigzags from zenith to horizon, darts from\r\ncloud to cloud, or strikes like a javelin toward earth. At night,\r\nparticularly in the country where no city lights mask its brilliance,\r\nlightning can be a frightening elemental force. A form popularly\r\ncalled “heat” or “sheet” lightning is a familiar, almost playful\r\nphenomenon in the midwest and southwest, although comparatively rare\r\non the east coast. In hot, humid weather it flares intermittently\r\nnear the horizon, noiseless because the luminous “sheets” are merely\r\nreflections of an ordinary zigzag flash that is too far away to be\r\nheard. “Bead lightning” has also been reported, appearing as a chain\r\nof spheroids that gradually fade away as they discharge. A spectacular\r\ndisplay of “pinched lightning,” an even rarer phenomenon (see Plate\r\nVa), was photographed in late August 1961 at Los Alamos, New Mexico,\r\nduring a severe thunderstorm[IX-7]. Ball lightning, which seems to\r\nbe commoner in Europe than in North America (just as tornadoes are\r\ncommoner in North America than in Europe) is so little understood that\r\nsome scientists have doubted its reality. In recent years, laboratory\r\nresearch has added much to our knowledge of ball lightning and Soviet\r\nscientists in particular have studied it as a possible weapon against\r\nenemy planes[IX-8].\r\n\r\nBall lightning is usually described as a luminous ball whose diameter\r\nranges from a few inches to several feet; the color may be red to\r\norange or blue to white. These lightning balls appear most frequently\r\ntoward the end of an electrical storm when the air is highly ionized,\r\noften just after a nearby lightning flash. They look and act like solid\r\nobjects. They can hang motionless or drift in the air, glide along\r\ntelephone wires or fences, roll down chimneys and across the floor to\r\nradio or TV sets, float a few inches above the ground or high in the\r\nsky. The ball persists as an entity for a time ranging from several\r\nseconds to many minutes; it may then evaporate noiselessly, or may\r\ndisappear with an explosive noise and a force that can damage nearby\r\nobjects[IX-8a]. One of the few existing photographs of ball lightning\r\nwas taken at Lincoln, Nebraska, on August 30, 1930 (see Plate Vb).\r\n\r\nAmerican, European, and Soviet scientists have suggested various\r\ntheories, none of them entirely satisfactory, to explain the formation\r\nof ball lightning[IX-9, IX-10, IX-11]. These evanescent fiery globes\r\nprobably represent some sort of continuous electric current perhaps\r\nheld together by its own magnetic field, like the fabled hoop snake\r\nthat could roll along the ground by holding its tail in its mouth.\r\n\r\nIn 1938 the pilot of a BOAC plane en route to Iraq, flying in dense\r\ncloud and rain at 8500 feet, reported that a ball of fire had entered\r\nthe rear cabin and burst with a loud explosion. One or two minutes\r\nlater it (or another lightning ball) entered the cockpit through the\r\nwindow which was open for visibility, singed the hair and eyebrows of\r\nthe pilot, then bounced on through the forward passenger cabin and into\r\nthe rear cabin, where it again exploded[IX-12].\r\n\r\nSimilar incidents have been reported by Soviet pilots. In the summer\r\nof 1956, a Soviet transport plane flying at about 10,000 feet was\r\nstruck by ball lightning during a very rough flight through a stormy\r\ncold front. A fiery red-orange ball ten to fifteen inches in diameter\r\nappeared in front of the aircraft, swerved to the left, struck the left\r\npropeller and exploded with a loud detonation and a blinding white\r\nflash. The intense electrical discharge destroyed radio communication\r\nbetween the plane and the ground and disabled the radio compass. In\r\nattempting to disconnect the antenna, the radio operator received an\r\nelectric shock. When the plane landed and was examined, one of the\r\nblades of the left propeller was found to be slightly damaged and a\r\nsmall fused area and a deposit of soot were found on the edge of the\r\nairfoil a few inches from its end[IX-13].\r\n\r\nA similar case occurred in December 1956, when a Soviet jet had entered\r\na storm cloud and was climbing through it. As the plane reached the top\r\nof the cloud, at an altitude of 12,000 to 15,000 feet, ball lightning\r\nsuddenly appeared a short distance ahead and to the right of the plane,\r\nand exploded with a dull but piercing noise and a blinding flash; the\r\nball then broke into a series of beads. Although one of the engines\r\nclose to the ball died at the instant of the explosion, the crew were\r\nable to start it again and the flight continued normally. After landing\r\nand finding no mechanical damage, they concluded that the engine had\r\nfailed temporarily because the explosion had formed a region of\r\nintense rarefied air that deprived the engine of oxygen[IX-13].\r\n\r\nBall lightning has often been reported near the ground, as in\r\nthe Levelland case. In the summer of 1934 Mr. Durward, a British\r\nmeteorologist, while driving along the bank of a lake observed the\r\nphenomenon: “It began to rain heavily, with slight or moderate thunder\r\nand lightning. His son, a boy of twelve, was opening the iron gates,\r\nspaced at intervals on this road, and found one difficult to open.\r\nMr. Durward, while walking the short distance from the motor-car to\r\nthe gate to assist his son, saw among the pine trees on his left what\r\nlooked like a ball of fire about 12 in. in diameter moving towards\r\nthem. It struck the iron gatepost farthest from the latch. There was no\r\nnoise, but the boy, who had his hand on the latch, gave a yell; for the\r\nnext few hours he was unable to lower his arm.”[IX-12]\r\n\r\nIn Levelland the night of November 2 conditions were ideal for the\r\nformation of ball lightning. For several days the area had been\r\nexperiencing freak weather, and on the night in question had been\r\nvisited by rain, thunderstorms, and lightning. Shortly before the\r\nglowing sphere approached the truck, the two men had noticed a\r\nlightning flash in a nearby field. The original description of the\r\nphenomenon--a “flaming ball” or a “fiery tornado” that floated toward\r\nand over the truck and detonated with light and heat--fits the classic\r\npicture of ball lightning. The truck’s engine may have died for one of\r\nseveral reasons. The rain during the evening could have seeped under\r\nthe hood and soaked the ignition or dampened the spark plugs. The\r\nfeed line may have been clogged. Or the region of highly rarefied air\r\ncreated by the ball lightning may temporarily have deprived the engine\r\nof oxygen.\r\n\r\nOf the other drivers near Levelland that night who reported having\r\ntrouble with balky motors and seeing a blazing object like an\r\negg-shaped fireball, three probably saw ball lightning. Others, after\r\nhearing Saucedo’s frightening story, perhaps unconsciously dramatized\r\ntheir own experiences and magnified ordinary lightning flashes into\r\nattacking fiery objects. It is significant that although the night\r\nwas stormy, only Saucedo reported seeing the ordinary lightning that\r\nnormally accompanies a thunderstorm.\r\n\r\nSince ball lightning is short-lived and cannot be preserved as\r\ntangible evidence, its appearance in Levelland on the night of November\r\n2 can never be absolutely proved, even though this explanation fits\r\nall the facts--facts that in themselves do not warrant so lengthy a\r\nstudy. Only the saucer proponents could have converted so trivial a\r\nseries of events--a few stalled automobiles, balls of flame in the sky\r\nat the end of a thunderstorm--into a national mystery. Ball lightning\r\ndoubtless accounts for other UFO reports, such as the phenomenon\r\nobserved at Lock Raven Dam on October 26, 1958, when two men returning\r\nlate at night from a fishing trip saw a flaming ball hovering above the\r\nsuperstructure of a bridge; the ball exploded with a loud noise and a\r\nbrilliant white flash and disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_E-M and Non-E-M Saucers_\r\n\r\nThe next UFOs reported in this series belonged to the old-fashioned,\r\nnon-E-M variety. From White Sands Proving Grounds near Alamogordo,\r\nNew Mexico, came a report that military police, while patrolling the\r\nup-range in a jeep about 2:30 Sunday morning (a few hours after the\r\nSaucedo incident), had seen a brilliant reddish-orange light, shaped\r\nlike an egg, hovering in the sky. From its apparent distance (two to\r\nthree miles away) and apparent size (as large as a grapefruit held at\r\narm’s length), the men deduced that it was a huge object, 75 to 100\r\nyards in diameter[IX-2]. After remaining motionless for about three\r\nminutes, it descended toward the ground and disappeared. (According\r\nto some versions, it later rose into the sky and then disappeared.)\r\nMembers of another jeep patrol soon matched this tale with the report\r\nthat on Sunday night about eight o’clock they had seen a bright,\r\nglowing object hovering in the sky but, instead of landing, it suddenly\r\nclimbed until it got so far up it looked like a star. Both jeeps, it\r\nshould be noted, continued to function normally.\r\n\r\nOfficials at White Sands soon dampened the excitement. The description\r\nof the light that appeared at 2:30 A.M. included certain doubtful\r\nfactors. The night had been overcast and so dark that the stars were\r\nnot visible, although the cloud cover was broken at intervals. Since\r\nthe sighting had not included any object of known distance or known\r\nsize for comparison, the estimates of the UFO’s distance and size\r\nwere of no value. The light might have been small and close; it might\r\nequally well have been huge and far away. Under the circumstances,\r\nthe most probable explanation was that the men had glimpsed the moon\r\n(then roughly half full) through broken clouds, and that the apparent\r\nmovement was an illusion produced by the moving clouds. The Sunday\r\nevening UFO was unquestionably the planet Venus. Then nearly at maximum\r\nbrilliance, it was a conspicuous object in the western sky after sunset\r\nand inspired many saucer reports during this week of anxiety.\r\n\r\nThe White Sands incidents had reached the papers, however, and\r\ncontributed to the general hysteria. By Monday afternoon, flying eggs\r\nwere allegedly stopping automobiles as far north as Canada, but the\r\nSouthwest continued to hold the center of the UFO stage against all\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nOn Monday night, November 4, the Alamogordo, New Mexico, radio station\r\nbroadcast a dramatic interview with an engineer from Holloman Air\r\nForce Base, New Mexico, describing his sighting of an E-M-radiating\r\nUFO at least 500 feet long. About one o’clock on Monday afternoon, Mr.\r\nX stated, he was returning to base after a weekend in El Paso[IX-4].\r\nWhile driving along a desert stretch of U. S. Highway 54 near the town\r\nof Orogrande, he noticed a group of cars stopped ahead of him, their\r\npassengers standing in the road, pointing at the sky. Looking up, he\r\nsaw an iridescent egg-shaped object at least 500 feet long--more than\r\ntwice the size of the UFOs reported in the preceding two days. As it\r\napproached, the flying egg exerted a force that killed the engine\r\nof his car, generated a wave of heat that gave him a bad burn, and\r\ndemonstrated a startling new characteristic: it silenced the radio\r\nin his car. (During the next few days, reports of similar encounters\r\nusually included a jammed radio.) When the UFO took off toward the\r\nmountains and disappeared, Mr. X started his car again and drove on\r\ninto Alamogordo to the home of a friend, Mrs. Coral Lorenzen.\r\n\r\nOne of the most zealous amateur investigators of UFO reports, Mrs.\r\nLorenzen had founded the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization (APRO)\r\n(see _Chapter_ XIII) in January 1952, and from 1954 to 1956 had been\r\nemployed at Holloman Air Force Base. After listening to Mr. X’s\r\nstory and examining the notes he had scribbled during the sighting\r\n(unfortunately they proved to be illegible, but for some reason no one\r\nhas ever suggested that the pen or pencil was also hexed by the UFO),\r\nshe hurried him down to the local radio station where he made the taped\r\ninterview that was broadcast later that evening.\r\n\r\nA daylight visit by an E-M flying egg 500 feet in length would\r\nsupposedly have attracted the attention of many witnesses. Air Force\r\ninvestigators could find only one: Mr. X. According to his testimony,\r\nthe passengers of several automobiles (his estimate of the number of\r\ncars varied from time to time but he eventually settled on ten) had\r\nstood in the road watching the unknown object. A persistent search\r\nby Air Force officials failed to locate any one of these persons.\r\nThe witness showed no sign of the burns he allegedly suffered. In\r\nshort, the only evidence to support his story was Mr. X’s own and the\r\nauthorities sensibly concluded that the incident was either a hoax or a\r\nhallucination, inspired by newspaper publicity about Levelland’s flying\r\neggs.\r\n\r\nTuesday morning’s chief contribution to the UFO epidemic was not to be\r\nlaughed off so easily, for it was made by trained military personnel.\r\nAt 5:10 A.M. on November 5, the Coast Guard cutter _Sebago_, traveling\r\nnorth in the Gulf of Mexico, detected an erratically maneuvering UFO on\r\nthe radarscope. The swiftly moving object would race across and off the\r\nscope, only to reappear almost immediately from another direction and\r\nposition and again move off the scope at incredible speed. After ten\r\nminutes the radar target vanished, but watchers on the deck glimpsed a\r\nglowing object, brilliant as a planet; it streaked across the sky just\r\nabove the northwest horizon and vanished. The unknown radar targets\r\nthen returned and continued to fill the scope with their incredible\r\nmovements until 5:37, when they finally disappeared and did not return.\r\n\r\nThis mystery, too, yielded to orderly investigation. Air Force radar\r\nexperts made a detailed analysis of the data and positively identified\r\nthe mysterious returns. They had not come from the complex air traffic\r\noverhead, as had first been suggested, nor from a fantastically\r\nmaneuverable spaceship. They were merely false targets produced by\r\nthe weather conditions (see _Chapter_ VIII). The brilliant light that\r\nflashed across the sky was not reported by the radarscope and had no\r\nrelation to the radar returns. In view for a few seconds at most,\r\nbrilliant in the morning twilight (the sun rose some fifty minutes\r\nlater), the flash of light was probably a distant meteor--November is\r\nrich in meteor displays.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Saturnian Visitors_\r\n\r\nTuesday evening while the nation was still wondering about the flying\r\neggs in New Mexico and the invisible UFOs that buzzed the _Sebago_,\r\nwelcome comic relief appeared. A man named Schmidt, a grain buyer,\r\nannounced that during the afternoon he had visited with the crew of\r\na flying saucer that had landed to make repairs. While driving in\r\nthe country near Kearney, Nebraska, he said, he had noticed a bright\r\nflash about a quarter of a mile away. Going closer to investigate, he\r\nperceived a huge silvery ship a hundred feet long, thirty feet wide,\r\nand fourteen feet high, which had landed in a dry river bed. The motor\r\nof his car then died. He got out and was walking toward the ship when a\r\nlight shot out and paralyzed him. The ship opened and two men emerged.\r\nAfter searching him for concealed weapons, they released him from\r\nparalysis and invited him into the ship, where he spent half an hour\r\nchatting with these strangers and their female companions, mostly in\r\nHigh German and English. (He knew that they came from outer space but\r\nnot until some weeks later, when they paid him a second visit, did he\r\ndiscover that they were natives of the planet Saturn.)[IX-14] After he\r\nleft the ship it rose straight up into the sky and disappeared, while\r\nhe hurried back to town to report to the sheriff, to broadcast an\r\naccount of his experience over the local radio, and to give his story\r\nto the newspapers.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps a measure of the panic level that week that local\r\nofficials actually examined the ground at the “landing” site, looking\r\nfor evidence. They found none. The four “hydraulic rams” that allegedly\r\nsupported the huge machine had left no imprint on the sand of the dry\r\nriver bed. Traces of oil found on the ground were tested chemically and\r\nproved to be the same brand that the witness carried in the trunk of\r\nhis car.\r\n\r\nGaining national notoriety from this incident, Schmidt soon became\r\na popular lecturer at flying-saucer clubs, thrilling the audience\r\nwith tales of later visits from the Saturnians and his journeys\r\nin their spaceship to the Arctic Circle, through the waters under\r\nthe North Pole, and even into outer space. A year or so later his\r\nextraterrestrial friends allegedly tipped him off to the location of\r\ncertain valuable minerals on earth, including veins of quartz that had\r\nthe desirable property of curing cancer. To mine this quartz and thus\r\nmake it available to humanity, he enlisted the sympathy and financial\r\naid of a number of lonely, wealthy widows. Some of these ladies\r\neventually came to believe that they had been the victims of fraud and,\r\nin 1961, a California jury agreed with them. The Saturnians apparently\r\nhave not yet reappeared to help their friend out of his difficulties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Surveillance by Flying Eggs_\r\n\r\nWednesday November 6 was relatively calm on the UFO front, although\r\nautomobile engines died, radios malfunctioned, and TV screens\r\nblurred at about the time that lights were reported in the sky in\r\nTexas, New Mexico, Illinois, and Canada. Accounts received later by\r\nsaucer organizations stated that on Tuesday (or Wednesday) night an\r\norange-colored, whistling, E-M type of UFO had hovered near Fort Itaipu\r\nin Brazil, caused a temporary failure of the electric lights, and then\r\nknocked out the generating plant for several moments. Since the alleged\r\nvisitation occurred in a foreign country it was not, of course, open to\r\nstudy by the United States Air Force. In any case investigation would\r\nhave been difficult, since the report failed to include such facts as\r\nthe exact time of appearance, position, and direction of movement of\r\nthe UFO. The witnesses, whose names were not given, apparently related\r\nthe incident under pledge of secrecy to other persons who insisted\r\non remaining anonymous, who passed the story on to still others who\r\nrefused to be named, who in turn gave the news to reporters, who signed\r\nonly their initials[IX-15]. So insubstantial a tale obviously does\r\nnot merit serious investigation. The dimming of electric lights and\r\nthe capricious behavior of a generating system are not extraordinary\r\nphenomena and no UFO is required to account for them.\r\n\r\nThe next incident to gain publicity in this amazing week occurred on\r\nThursday (or Wednesday) evening when a UFO allegedly landed in Ohio\r\nand then vanished. Driving home in the early evening along a country\r\nroad, a Mr. Olden Moore saw a glowing UFO in the sky. At first it\r\nlooked small, like a star, but it rapidly increased in size and split\r\napart in the air as it descended and apparently landed in a nearby\r\nfield. Moore stopped his car, intending to investigate, but for some\r\nreason he changed his mind and instead drove on home to get his\r\nwife. When they returned and searched the field they found nothing.\r\nNevertheless, they reported the incident to the authorities and next\r\nday a Civilian Defense official, arriving to check the ground where the\r\nUFO supposedly had landed, reported the level of radioactivity “far\r\nabove normal.”\r\n\r\nA woman living half a mile away from the field in question reported\r\nthat, although she herself had not seen a UFO, her TV set had blurred\r\nat about the time of the sighting, and on the following day she found\r\nthat her car, parked near the house, was pockmarked. Applying his\r\nGeiger counter to the car, the Civilian Defense official pronounced it\r\nradioactive[IX-16]. This UFO apparently possessed highly selective E-M\r\npowers: it did not stop the engine of Mr. Moore’s car but did interfere\r\nwith the operation of a TV set half a mile away!\r\n\r\nAir Force investigators patiently collected and sifted the facts.\r\nThe supposed landing site showed nothing abnormal--the grass was not\r\nburned, the earth was not disturbed, no foreign material could be\r\nfound. The normal radioactivity of the ground in the area measured .18\r\nmilliroentgens; at the supposed landing site the measure had been .20\r\nmilliroentgens. This difference of .02 is not “far above normal” but\r\nwell within the probable error in the calibration of the instruments.\r\n\r\nInterviews with other Ohioans who had also seen the glowing unknown\r\nprovided the answer: the UFO was a large meteor, conspicuous in the\r\ndusk of early evening. Traveling directly toward the witness, it\r\nhad looked like a glowing sphere suspended in the air and rapidly\r\nincreasing in brightness. Near the end of its flight it split into two\r\nor more pieces and fell silently to the earth, not “in the next field”\r\nbut perhaps many miles away. The blurring of the TV set may have been\r\nmere coincidence or, if the meteor had actually passed close by, may\r\nhave resulted from the ionized trail of the meteor (see _Chapter_ V).\r\n\r\n\r\n_Saucerdom’s Miraculous Electromagnetic Force_\r\n\r\nMost of us remember the nursery tale of Chicken-Little, who started a\r\npanic in the barnyard kingdom with her eyewitness report that the sky\r\nwas falling: “I saw it with my eyes, I heard it with my ears, and a\r\npiece of it fell on my tail.” Calm was restored in the kingdom, after\r\na time, when the prosaic truth came to light: a falling acorn, not a\r\npiece of the sky, had grazed the credulous chick.\r\n\r\nIn somewhat similar fashion, the hysteria caused by the car-stalling\r\nflying eggs subsided. As the Russian satellites gliding across the\r\nnight sky proved more interesting to the public than hypothetical\r\nspaceships, flying-saucer stories occupied less and less space in\r\nthe daily papers and the number of UFO reports dwindled. Air Force\r\ninvestigators worked hard at the job of separating facts from fantasy\r\nand by Saturday November 9, 1957, the end of a wild week, the panic was\r\nover. During the two years following, 1958 and 1959, fewer than a dozen\r\nE-M-equipped UFOs were reported over the entire American continent.\r\n\r\nThe civilian flying-saucer groups, however, rejected the\r\nnormal explanations of the November reports except that of the\r\nSchmidt-Saturnian meeting, which all but the cultists indignantly\r\ndenounced as a hoax publicized to embarrass sincere students of UFOs.\r\nDissatisfied with the solutions found by the Air Force, the National\r\nInvestigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP) carried out an\r\nindependent study (see _Chapter_ XIII) of the November sightings,\r\nand in June 1960 issued a booklet entitled “Electro-Magnetic Effects\r\nAssociated With Unidentified Flying Objects (UFO’s).” After examining\r\nmany reports of E-M phenomena and rejecting an unspecified number as\r\nunreliable, members of the investigating committee studied the evidence\r\nin a series of eighty-one incidents occurring over a period of fifteen\r\nyears, roughly a third of which were reported during the week of the\r\nLevelland panic[IX-17].\r\n\r\nThe cases include instances in which, allegedly, electrical\r\nappliances failed to function, at the same time and the same place\r\nin which a witness observed a UFO. In some cases a witness observed\r\nelectromagnetic effects but did not see a UFO, at the same time that\r\na neighboring witness saw a UFO but did not observe electromagnetic\r\neffects. The effects in question include the stopping, missing,\r\nsputtering, and near-quitting of automobile motors; the dimming or\r\nflickering of automobile headlights; static, roar, or fading of car\r\nradios; the dimming and brightening of house lights; the dimming and\r\nbrightening of cabin lights in airplanes; the blurring of TV screens;\r\nthe temporary loss of picture and/or sound in a TV set; the stopping of\r\nwatches and clocks; and odd noises over a telephone wire.\r\n\r\nThis list may astonish the average citizen who has often endured\r\nsimilar annoyances and never thought of blaming UFOs for his troubles.\r\nMost householders know that watches run down, that houselights dim\r\nand brighten with the changing demands made on the city electrical\r\nsystem, and that a plane flying over a house can blur the image on a\r\nTV screen. There can be few readers of this book who have not at some\r\ntime experienced such brief frustrations with automobiles, radios, TV\r\nsets, and timepieces--the ordinary troubles that keep our repairmen in\r\nbusiness without assistance from UFOs.\r\n\r\nTo the heterogeneous data provided by these eighty-one cases, the\r\ncommittee attempted to apply the precise tools of logic and mathematics\r\nin order to establish a correlation between UFOs and electromagnetic\r\neffects, and concluded that a cause-and-effect relationship probably\r\ndid exist.\r\n\r\nWith suitable material, statistical methods can suggest a correlation\r\nbetween any two sets of facts and can estimate the probability that\r\nthe correlation is significant and not due to chance. No competent\r\nstatistician, however, would try to apply the methods to such amorphous\r\nand uncertain data as those used by the committee. More than a third of\r\nthe incidents cited come from newspaper accounts or the private files\r\nof saucer organizations in foreign countries. All leave many unanswered\r\nquestions. At least two involve fully identified objects: the great\r\nfireball of September 18, 1954 (p. 92), and the three fireballs of\r\nApril 6, 1955, may well have caused some radio interference but they\r\nwere not UFOs. Even with the well-reported cases, a conscientious\r\nhistorian would find it nearly impossible to determine precisely what\r\nthe witnesses saw, what they heard, what they did, and what they said.\r\n\r\nThe various printed accounts of the Levelland incidents, for example,\r\nvary in many details. The events took place in an atmosphere of\r\nexcitement and the stories inevitably changed slightly with each\r\nretelling. The reports of Air Force investigators, records in the files\r\nof civilian saucer organizations, statements in newspapers, magazines,\r\nand books--no two give exactly the same version of any given incident.\r\nAlthough the points of disagreement are often trivial, they are\r\nsometimes vital to finding the correct explanation.\r\n\r\nEven if, for the sake of argument, a statistician were willing to\r\naccept the evidence of the eighty-one cases at face value, he would\r\nstill not attempt to establish a correlation between UFOs and E-M\r\neffects. The probability that a (postulated) UFO will appear at a given\r\ntime or place is unknown; the probability that an electrical appliance\r\nwill fail to work at a given time or place is equally unknown. Hence\r\nthe probability that the two phenomena will occur together at a given\r\ntime and place is a concept that has no meaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Effects and Causes_\r\n\r\nAsked to explain what caused the failures of engines, radios, watches,\r\netc. reported during the week of the Levelland sightings, any high\r\nschool physics student who answered, “Some new kind of electromagnetic\r\nforce” would properly receive a grade of zero. Admittedly there are\r\nphysical phenomena that the scientist does not yet understand, but\r\nhe does know that electrical and magnetic forces do not and can not\r\nperform all the feats attributed to them by saucer enthusiasts.\r\n\r\nThe electrical failures ascribed to E-M forces undoubtedly had a\r\nvariety of causes. Automobile engines can stall for many reasons. Rain\r\nseeping under the hood of a car can soak the ignition and temporarily\r\ninterfere with smooth operation. Sand or dust or a vapor lock in the\r\nfuel line can do the same. The body of an automobile is metal and\r\ncompletely encloses the ignition system and the motor. The engine\r\nstops if it is deprived of gasoline or oxygen, but it does not stop\r\nif lightning strikes the car. The metal body acts as a shield that\r\nelectrical forces cannot penetrate.\r\n\r\nEvery driver knows that the reception on a car radio normally varies\r\nfrom poor to fair; it rarely remains constant. While moving beneath a\r\npower line, a car may receive no radio signals at all. A high-tension\r\nline can be surrounded by an electrical field that makes a radio set\r\nhum or buzz raucously and completely jams the reception. Static or\r\na powerful interfering signal can easily jam a car’s radio, but no\r\nelectrical field, static or oscillating, can kill a car’s motor or\r\nshut off its lights or stop the dashboard clock; it could not stop\r\nthe driver’s wrist watch, and it could not stop a man’s watch without\r\nseriously injuring the wearer, even if he were standing in an open\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nRadio and TV sets may function badly for one of many reasons. They\r\nmay simply need a good repairman! A passing plane, a more powerful\r\ntransmitting station on the air, auroral activity, stormy weather,\r\nultraviolet radiation, or clouds of ejected atoms from the sun--any of\r\nthese can disrupt radio or TV communication, but they do not interfere\r\nwith the operation of gasoline engines.\r\n\r\nAll meteors bright enough to be seen can cause some radio and TV\r\ninterference--and in the first week of November the Taurid shower\r\nis approaching its maximum. Although meteors do not, by themselves,\r\nemit any appreciable amount of radio energy, the friction between the\r\nswiftly moving meteoric body and the atmosphere produces a train of hot\r\ngases that can momentarily reflect radio waves. The brightest meteors\r\nleave behind them a persistent cloud of luminous, electrified gas that\r\ncan absorb radio waves and thus blanket incoming signals for several\r\nminutes after the meteor has passed. A spectacular fireball observed\r\nabout 8:30 P.M. M.S.T. on April 18, 1962, momentarily turned off the\r\nstreet lights in the town of Eureka, Utah; it was so bright that it\r\ntriggered the photoelectric control, just as daybreak does[IX-17a].\r\n\r\nNo imaginable single force--electric, magnetic, or gravitational--could\r\npossibly have caused _all_ the effects attributed to saucerdom’s\r\nmiraculous electromagnetic force. An E-M field with the postulated\r\npowers is as improbable as a force that would lift fallen apples from\r\nthe ground and draw them up to reunite with the branches of their\r\nparent tree.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose for a moment, however, that the incidents in the\r\nLevelland epidemic might have occurred just as they are described by\r\nthe NICAP committee. If UFOs had been visiting the earth that week,\r\nprojecting a force field that performed as claimed, certain other\r\nevents should also have occurred.\r\n\r\nThousands of automobiles should have been, but were not, temporarily\r\ndisabled in the neighborhood of every car-stopping UFO. Fantastic\r\ntraffic jams have sometimes been caused by torrid weather and\r\nconsequent vapor locks in the fuel lines of automobile engines. In June\r\n1961, for example, a sudden heat wave in Boston caused a vapor-lock\r\nepidemic that tied up traffic on the main highways for three hours. On\r\nsome stretches of road so many cars were immobilized that, with their\r\nhoods up to cool off, they looked “like a convention of pelicans.” No\r\nsuch traffic jams were reported in connection with the 1957 UFOs. In\r\nSouth Springfield, Ohio, a car and a taxicab stalled but the vehicles\r\naround them experienced no trouble. One car stalled in Houston and\r\nanother in Santa Fe, but the traffic around them proceeded as usual.\r\n\r\nHundreds of TV sets should have blurred, but did not, in the\r\nneighborhood of every TV-blurring UFO.\r\n\r\nEqually surprising, no one complained of UFO interference with hi-fi\r\nsets, vacuum cleaners, refrigerators, washing machines, irons,\r\nfreezers, or electric razors. No airplane, helicopter, motorcycle, or\r\nocean liner reported engine trouble.\r\n\r\nAt least two landings were reported, in New Mexico and Ohio. No\r\nphysical evidence of landing could be found--shrubs were not crushed,\r\ngrass was not scorched, ground was not disturbed.\r\n\r\nExcept for the _Sebago_, no radar reported the presence of a UFO.\r\n\r\nMoonwatch teams, trained specifically to detect, observe, and plot\r\nthe exact path of moving objects in the sky, were on the alert that\r\nweek all over the United States and Canada. They did not see even one\r\nunidentified flying object.\r\n\r\n\r\n_“G-Fields” and UFO Propulsion_\r\n\r\nEven more fantastic than the E-M force that stops cars and silences\r\nradios is the artificial gravitational field or “G-field,” which\r\nsaucer enthusiasts call on to account for all UFOs whose reported\r\nbehavior clearly contradicts the laws of physics. Employing\r\nelectromagnetic forces, the UFOs supposedly can create a variety\r\nof G-fields as needed, to be used as a defense weapon, a means to\r\ninvisibility, or a method of propulsion[IX-18, IX-19].\r\n\r\nWriters of science fiction have regularly utilized similar handy\r\nexpedients such as “gravity shields,” “force fields,” “inertia drives,”\r\nand “space warps” to move their heroes quickly from earth to remote\r\nparts of the galaxy. Physicists, too, dream of revealing new aspects of\r\nnature that would allow man to nullify the effects of gravity and make\r\nshort cuts through space, but they realize that such devices, even if\r\ntheoretically not impossible, must await unimaginable discoveries about\r\nnature and are at least far in the future.\r\n\r\nUnlike the amateur investigator of UFOs, both the storyteller and\r\nthe physicist know that if and when such advances are made, they\r\nwill enlarge our understanding of the cosmos, as did the creative\r\ninsights of Galileo, Newton, and Einstein, but new discoveries cannot\r\ninvalidate what we have already learned about how the universe works.\r\nMany of the properties ascribed to UFOs imply a complete breakdown of\r\nphysical law. They belong to the realm of magic, not science. Traveling\r\nat speeds approaching the velocity of light, reversing direction\r\ninstantaneously, achieving maximum acceleration or deceleration in\r\na fraction of a second, becoming invisible at will--such feats are\r\nimpossible for a solid body moving either in an atmosphere or in space.\r\nMost of the serious proponents of the saucer hypothesis acknowledge\r\nthat such actions are impossible, according to our present knowledge,\r\nbut they argue that alien races more advanced than earthmen have\r\nundoubtedly found new sources of power and developed new methods of\r\npropulsion. Elaborate theories have been constructed, phrased in nearly\r\nincomprehensible scientific jargon, to show that UFOs do not flout the\r\nlaws of physics but merely operate under laws that are still unknown to\r\nhuman beings.\r\n\r\nTo UFO investigators whose professional training lies chiefly in\r\nfields other than physics--business, the arts, entertainment, military\r\nscience, government, the law, medicine, or religion--such theories\r\nmight well seem plausible. But to the physicist they seem so irrational\r\nthat they do not even deserve discussion, and he dismisses them as\r\nnonsense. Saucer believers thereupon denounce the physicist as a\r\nbigot, complain of his “closed mind,” and piously invoke the ghost\r\nof Galileo. They forget, apparently, that the persecutors of Galileo\r\nwere specialists in theology and had only a nodding acquaintance with\r\nastronomy.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest theories of UFO propulsion suggested that saucers\r\ngot their motive power by tapping the lines of force in the earth’s\r\nmagnetic field. One author wrote:\r\n\r\n“The earth being simply a huge magnet, a dynamo wound with magnetic\r\nlines of force as its coils, tenescopically [the meaning of this\r\nimpressive word is unknown to the present authors] counted to be 1,257\r\nto the square centimeter in one direction and 1,850 to the square\r\ncentimeter in the other direction (eddy currents), indicates that\r\nnatural law has placed these lines as close together as the hairs on\r\none’s head. And yet they never touch or cross each other if let alone.\r\nIf done so by accident the catastrophe would spread like a searchlight\r\nand destroy everything in its path.”[IX-20, p. 139]\r\n\r\nThe same author asserts that such a “catastrophe” is the true\r\nexplanation of Mantell’s death (p. 33). Supposedly objecting to his\r\nclose approach, the occupants of the saucer he was chasing manipulated\r\nsome of the lines of force until they crossed in front of Mantell; the\r\nresulting surge of power knocked the plane out of the air. Under some\r\nconditions, he adds, the crossing of the lines can produce desirable\r\neffects, such as the Aurora Borealis, when “we have magnetic lines\r\nof force that are crossing one another at or near the geographic and\r\nthe magnetic poles and as a result we see those beautiful colored\r\nlights.”[IX-20, p. 141]\r\n\r\nTo the physicist, these statements are an unsavory verbal hash. Lines\r\nof force cannot provide a source of power and they cannot cause\r\nexplosions--they are not even real. Created merely to describe the\r\nbehavior of magnetic fields, they have no more objective existence than\r\na train of thought. By using the convenient fiction that lines of force\r\nemerge from the north magnetic pole, spread apart as they flow around\r\nthe earth, and then crowd close together again as they enter the south\r\nmagnetic pole, the physicist is able to map observed variations in the\r\nearth’s magnetic field. In a similar way the geographer uses contour\r\nlines to map high and low areas on the earth’s surface.\r\n\r\nA spacecraft could not propel itself by hitching to magnetic lines of\r\nforce any more than a man could travel from Philadelphia to Peru by\r\nsliding down the 75th line of longitude.\r\n\r\nThe more sophisticated students of UFO behavior do not propose magnetic\r\nlines of force as a source of power. In fact they skip lightly over the\r\nawkward question of how the saucers are propelled and vaguely assert\r\nthat extraterrestrial vehicles obtain energy (apparently without doing\r\nequivalent work) by somehow plugging in to the cosmic rays and magnetic\r\nfields that exist in space. Thus having access to unlimited power, a\r\nsaucer supposedly draws on E-M forces to create and enclose itself\r\nin a kind of cocoon of artificial gravity. This G-field cuts off the\r\nattraction of the earth and other heavenly bodies, enables the saucer\r\nto attract or repel any approaching object, and allows it to travel\r\nalmost as fast as light without suffering an increase in mass or a\r\ntransformation into energy[IX-18].\r\n\r\n\r\n_The G-Field Myth_\r\n\r\nTo explain the alleged properties and behavior of flying saucers, a\r\nvariety of speculations have been published on the nature and operation\r\nof the G-field[IX-18, IX-19, IX-21]. In the physicist’s view, most of\r\nthese ideas belong more to the realm of magic than of science but we\r\nshall summarize them briefly, with a few parenthetical comments.\r\n\r\nA UFO supposedly can travel at speeds of thousands of miles an hour and\r\nshatter the sound barrier without making any noise because the G-field\r\nwould create a kind of protective envelope around the saucer. But if\r\nthe G-field breaks down for any reason, so that the protective envelope\r\nis opened, then the ionized moving air hits ordinary static air and\r\ncreates the thunderous detonation produced by some UFOs. (Even with an\r\nintact G-field, a boundary or gradient would always exist somewhere\r\nbetween the air that was dragged along by the saucer and the air that\r\nwas not. A thunderous impact would certainly occur at this barrier.)\r\n\r\nThe “invisible” UFOs supposedly become so by using the G-field to\r\nbend or deflect rays of light. (It is true that starlight passing near\r\nthe sun’s gravitational field suffers a deflection that makes the star\r\nappear slightly displaced from its actual position on the celestial\r\nsphere, but a shift in apparent location does not dim a star and does\r\nnot make it invisible. Furthermore the amount of deflection is only\r\n1.75 _seconds_ of arc, less than half of a thousandth of a degree! To\r\nproduce even this small deflection, a covey of saucers would have to be\r\nable to increase its mass to equal that of the sun: 1.97 times 10^{33}\r\ngrams! What this increase in mass would do to the rest of the solar\r\nsystem doesn’t bear thinking of.)\r\n\r\nAngel hair (see _Chapter_ XI) is supposed to be a waste product from\r\nthe operation of the G-field. The ionization of the air inside the\r\nG-field allegedly would create heavy atoms that reacted chemically\r\nwith the atoms in ordinary air to produce a kind of precipitate that\r\nfalls to the ground and disappears as the ionization decreases. (In the\r\nphysics laboratory, ionization means taking an electron away from an\r\nelectrically neutral atom. The resulting atom would not be heavier. The\r\ncontact between ordinary air and that in the ionized trail of a meteor\r\nhas never yet produced “angel hair.” No laboratory has ever reported\r\nthat isotopes of oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and other elements in\r\nthe atmosphere can react with their normal analogues to produce\r\nprecipitates. A change in ionization cannot make a chemical compound\r\ndisappear.)\r\n\r\nThe envelope of air enclosed by the G-field is supposed to allow a UFO\r\nto accelerate or change direction instantaneously, even when flying\r\nat enormous speeds, because the UFO would not encounter atmospheric\r\nfriction. (Vehicles moving in the earth’s gravitational field are also\r\nsurrounded by a cushion of air, but they still must overcome friction.)\r\n\r\nAt this point the whole G-field myth falls apart. One of the\r\nfundamental laws established by Newton, to which no exception has ever\r\nbeen found in the laboratory, states that a moving object will continue\r\nto move in a straight line unless it encounters an applied force. Let\r\nus suppose, for the moment, that a gravity shield could suddenly be\r\ninterposed between a spacecraft and the earth, and thus make the craft\r\nreverse its direction of flight. The occupants would still be subject\r\nto the law of inertia. They would be hurled against the wall of the\r\ncraft with a violence far greater than that experienced by a plane\r\ncrashing to earth from an altitude of 30,000 feet. There could be no\r\ncushioning of the blow.\r\n\r\nSuch dreams demonstrate an almost contemptuous disregard for reality.\r\nPhysicists admittedly do not yet understand the basic nature of\r\ngravity, but they do know a great deal about how it acts. Gravity is\r\nthe force that holds the universe together. It exerts a pull on all\r\nobjects in the physical world--the earth, the moon, the planets, our\r\nsun, the distant stars, and even the stars in other galaxies. All\r\nthese bodies without exception move according to the law of universal\r\ngravitation as formulated by Newton and refined by Einstein: Every\r\nparticle in the universe attracts every other particle with a force\r\nthat is proportional to the product of their masses, and inversely\r\nproportional to the square of the distance between them. The magnitude\r\nof the force depends only on the masses of the bodies and on their\r\ndistances from each other. It does not depend at all on the nature of\r\nthe medium that separates them. It operates unchanged through stone,\r\nmetal, water, air, or empty space. With a metal shield we can reduce\r\nelectrical forces to zero; with a soft-iron shield we can weaken\r\nmagnetic forces; but no substance existing in nature can act as a\r\nshield to shut out the force of gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Electricity, Magnetism, and Gravity_\r\n\r\nNo responsible scientist would assert that man has found out all\r\nthere is to know about the universe, and few would insist that some\r\nkind of a shield for gravity is an absolute impossibility. As yet,\r\nhowever, no laboratory has detected any phenomenon that might be\r\na clue to “negative gravity.” In recent years nuclear physicists\r\nhave occasionally caught fleeting glimpses of what has been called\r\n“anti-matter,” electrons with positive charges and protons with\r\nnegative charges--the reverse of their charges in the normal world.\r\nSome investigators have speculated on the gravitational properties of\r\nanti-matter, and have wondered whether it might exert a force that\r\nwould repel instead of attract.\r\n\r\nSo far no one has been able to think of an experiment to test the\r\nidea. Even if someone could find a way to collect a thimbleful of\r\nanti-matter, when he brought it into contact with normal matter, it,\r\nhe, and his surroundings would instantly detonate like a super-colossal\r\nneutron bomb. Many physicists believe that, since electrical forces\r\noperate independently of gravitational forces, interchanging the\r\ncharges on protons and electrons would probably have no effect on the\r\ngravitational field. Theoretical study and computations may someday\r\nyield an answer.\r\n\r\nFor years scientists have been searching for a “unified field theory,”\r\na single equation that would describe the interrelationship among\r\nelectrical, magnetic, and gravitational forces. Such a mathematical\r\nstatement would reveal the mysterious bond that holds together the\r\natomic nucleus, imparts to atoms their unique structure, and keeps the\r\nstars in their courses. But this unifying equation, when it is found,\r\nwill not make our present knowledge invalid. Enthusiasts are deluding\r\nthemselves when they base their belief in flying saucers on the hope\r\nof overthrowing the laws of gravity and inertia. Gravity, magnetism,\r\nand electricity are actual physical forces, as real as light, air,\r\nhouses, trees, or persons. They can act only according to the laws of\r\nnature which, unlike the laws passed by legislatures, are not subject\r\nto repeal. No juggling of words, no argument, no wish can change these\r\nlaws any more than they can stop the rising of the sun or the waning of\r\nthe moon.\r\n\r\nIf man is ever to learn to control the force of gravity, he will\r\nsucceed not by denying the reality of the laws but only by finding out\r\nwhat they are and by trying to understand them.\r\n\r\n[IX-1] Michel, A. _Flying Saucers and the Straight Line Mystery._ New\r\nYork: Criterion Books, 1958.\r\n\r\n[IX-2] Air Force Files.\r\n\r\n[IX-3] El Paso (Texas) _Times_, Nov. 4, 1957.\r\n\r\n[IX-4] Barker, G. “Chasing the Flying Saucers,” _Flying Saucers_ (May\r\n1958), p. 20 ff.\r\n\r\n[IX-5] Denver _Post_, Nov. 6, 1957.\r\n\r\n[IX-6] Viemeister, P.

Elaborate\r\nhoaxes have been perpetrated in music, art, literature, history,\r\nreligion, science--and in the world of flying saucers. Although the\r\nmotives for such swindles are not always obvious, the trickster is\r\nusually trying to promote a cause, to gain fame and/or prestige,\r\nto make money, to satirize a folly, or just to have some fun at\r\nthe public’s expense. Some hoaxes, such as Mark Twain’s petrified\r\nman, produce only harmless amusement. Others, planned as serious\r\ndeceptions, can cause long-lasting damage. The celebrated Piltdown\r\nman was fraudulently created from an ape’s jawbone, a stray tooth,\r\nand a few chemical staining agents; it gained fame for the scientists\r\ninvolved but threw the study of human evolution into a confusion that\r\nlasted more than twenty years, until the forgery was revealed in every\r\ndetail[X-1].\r\n\r\nA few hoaxes live on and on even after they are exposed, apparently\r\nbecause people enjoy believing in them. The Jersey devil, described as\r\na fire-breathing monster with huge wings and a long tail, was first\r\nmentioned in the columns of a small-town newspaper in New Jersey\r\nin 1906. Within a few days inhabitants of rural areas all over the\r\neast coast were reporting glimpses of the frightening demon and on\r\none particular night it allegedly terrified citizens in New Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland. The panic finally reached such\r\nheights that some towns closed their factories and theaters. This\r\nfantastic monster was quickly found to be a hoax, the brain child of\r\nthe publicity manager for a Philadelphia museum of freaks; his sole\r\npurpose had been to drum up customers for the museum. Nevertheless many\r\npersons rejected this explanation and continued to believe that the\r\ncreature really existed. It was reported again in 1926, in 1930, in\r\n1932, and may reappear again at any time. Obviously the Jersey devil,\r\nthough admittedly the product of a hoax, has become a permanent part of\r\nthe local fauna[X-2].\r\n\r\nFlying-saucer hoaxes are rarely submitted to the Air Force as bona fide\r\nsightings. Of 1500 UFO reports, only forty-two proved to be deliberate\r\nfrauds or the delusions of unstable persons. The hoaxer may give his\r\ntale to the newspapers, to a lecture audience, or even publish it in a\r\nbook, but he carefully avoids Air Force scrutiny. His story will not\r\nhold up under close investigation, and he knows it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earthlings and Extraterrestrials_\r\n\r\nThe fantasies of the obviously deluded are a problem for the clinician\r\nand will not be discussed in this book. Typical is the case of\r\n“Dr. X” who writes to strangers, inviting them to accompany him on\r\nhis next visit to the “Brothers” in space and to “join the side of\r\nrighteousness.” Although Dr. X has several times set a date for the\r\nexcursion, he has always had to postpone it for some reason. He\r\nhimself, he says, has made more than sixty journeys on flying saucers\r\nand mother ships, and has often taken his automobile along--just why he\r\nneeded it he does not explain.\r\n\r\nPeculiarly hard to classify are the “contact” reports, in which a\r\nwitness affirms that he has had one or more personal encounters with a\r\nspacecraft and that he has communicated with its occupants, who range\r\nin type from ordinary specimens of _Homo sapiens_ to hairy dwarfs and\r\nelephant-faced little men in space suits. He gives a more or less\r\ndetailed account of the incident and sometimes offers “proof” in the\r\nform of alleged photographs or fragments of the vehicle. Ostensibly\r\ninspired by religious or humanitarian motives, these “contactees”\r\nwholeheartedly support the theory that flying saucers originate in\r\nworlds beyond the earth.\r\n\r\nIn general the contactees tell essentially the same story, with minor\r\nvariations: Earthling (the witness) sees a flying saucer; saucer lands.\r\nExtraterrestrial occupant emerges, extends friendly greetings, confides\r\nhis wish to help the human race solve its problems, takes Earthling for\r\na cruise to another planet, brings Earthling back. After promising\r\nto maintain a sort of guardianship over the earth, the visitor says\r\nfarewell and flies back to his home planet.\r\n\r\nAlthough these stories are told in the first person, purportedly as\r\nfact, they perhaps should not be called hoaxes, for they can deceive\r\nonly the credulous who want to believe that supermen from other worlds\r\nare hovering near to save our troubled planet. With no suspense, little\r\ncharacterization, and ludicrously bad science, these naïve accounts are\r\nfiction of such poor quality that they would be rejected by even the\r\nmost hard-pressed editor of fantastic tales. Whether from Venus, Mars,\r\nSaturn, or the planets of other solar systems, these gods from the\r\nmachine all look just like human beings and either speak the colloquial\r\nlanguage of the contactee or communicate by thought transference. Their\r\nphysical appearance, clothing, tastes in food, habits of thought,\r\nand ethical values usually seem indistinguishable from those of the\r\ncitizens (whether American, French, or Brazilian) who report the\r\nvisitors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The “Contactees”_\r\n\r\nOne man who supposedly was privileged to make contact with visitors\r\nfrom space was Daniel Fry who, while strolling in the New Mexico\r\ndesert on the evening of July 4, 1950, noticed a flying saucer that\r\nhad apparently just landed. When he approached and started to touch\r\nthe ship, he suddenly heard a voice speaking in friendly caution:\r\n“Better not touch the hull, pal, it’s still hot.” The voice, he\r\ndiscovered, belonged to an extraterrestrial being in a mother ship that\r\nwas hovering some 900 miles above the earth. The craft on the ground\r\nneeded no crew, for it was a “remote-controlled cargo carrier,” sent\r\ndown to collect samples of the earth’s atmosphere. Communicating by\r\nmental telepathy, the spaceman revealed that, although he came from a\r\nremote planet, his ancestors had been earthmen who had migrated from\r\nthe island of Lemuria in ancient times (see _Chapter_ II). Strangely\r\nenough, although the visitor’s first remark had shown a remarkable\r\ncommand of contemporary English, he did not know what a roller coaster\r\nwas! He took such a fancy to Fry that he invited him to enter the cargo\r\ncraft and treated him to a quick flight to New York and back, a round\r\ntrip of 4000 miles completed in half an hour![X-3]\r\n\r\nA contactee whose experience offered variations on the basic theme was\r\nTruman Bethurum, a construction worker. According to his story, he\r\nhappened to be looking for sea shells in the Nevada desert sometime\r\nbefore dawn one morning in July 1952 when he encountered a flying\r\nsaucer and its friendly crew. The captain was a female, a “queen\r\namong women,” whose attractive costume included a bright-red skirt,\r\na black-velvet short-sleeved blouse, and a black beret with red\r\ntrim[X-4]. Though the grandmother of two, she was so beautiful that\r\nat their first meeting Bethurum was speechless. Obviously trying to\r\nput him at his ease, she smiled and said encouragingly, “Speak up, my\r\nfriend, you’re not hexed.” During the following months, he says, they\r\nhad several meetings and eventually, at her invitation, he accompanied\r\nher on an enjoyable visit to the saucer’s home base, the planet\r\n“Clarion.” Being placed directly behind the moon and apparently moving\r\nin a parallel orbit, this heavenly body has entirely escaped the notice\r\nof earthly astronomers[X-5].\r\n\r\nGeorge W. Van Tassel, operator of a commercial airport, resort, and\r\nguest ranch in California (for some reason most of the better-known\r\ncontactees seem to be Californians), allegedly made contact with\r\nspace beings of a more ethereal type. Their saucers traveled on power\r\nproduced by the “transmutation of hard light particles into soft light\r\nparticles,” and a typical vehicle was 1500 feet in diameter, 300 feet\r\nthick, and carried a crew of 7200. Why they needed so much room--more\r\nthan 70,000 cubic feet per spaceman--remains a mystery, for both the\r\nship and its occupants were made of pure light. The mother ships\r\nremained thousands of miles above the earth at substations from which\r\nthey sent out their “ventlos,” or flying saucers, to patrol the earth\r\nand try to improve conditions here. Speaking through Van Tassel, the\r\nvisitors sent many messages such as that of June 28, 1952:\r\n\r\n“Salutations. My identity is Qel, 72nd projection, 15th wave, realms of\r\nSchare [a saucer station in space]. We are passing over your cone of\r\nreceptivity, 172 thousand miles above you. Our center requests that I\r\ninform you. You will see more of us if you watch the skies.”\r\n\r\nSeveral times the spacemen threatened, if opposed, to launch thousands\r\nof saucers per second against the earth. In January 1953 they warned\r\nthat they had three substations in space ready to release 500,000\r\nsaucers each; two months later, in March, they informed Van Tassel that\r\nthey now had 3½ million saucers in operation around the earth. Somehow\r\nor other, this armada of UFOs seems to have remained invisible to both\r\nthe United States Air Force and the public[X-6].\r\n\r\nWhether such tales are delusions, fantasies, or hoaxes may be\r\nimpossible to determine. Some contact cases, however, undoubtedly\r\ncontain elements of fraud. At worst, the witness may be deliberately\r\ninventing the whole story from start to finish; at best, he may feel\r\nso certain of the reality of his experience that he feels justified in\r\nmanufacturing evidence to convince possible skeptics. No matter what\r\nhis motives, when he tries to add verisimilitude to his narrative by\r\nfabricating proofs, he joins the company of hoaxers[X-7].\r\n\r\nIn the Maury Island case (see _Chapter_ II), the witnesses offered\r\nalleged fragments of a disabled spaceship, which turned out to be\r\nchunks of slag. The scoutmaster in Florida exhibited singed hair on his\r\narm and a scorched cap to prove that he had suffered from the heat rays\r\nof a landed flying saucer (see _Chapter_ VII), and the grain salesman\r\nin Nebraska bolstered his tale of the Saturnian ship by pointing to\r\nshallow cracks in a dry river bed and oil smudges on the grass (see\r\n_Chapter_ IX).\r\n\r\nA contactee who provided “proof” of his story was Howard Menger, who\r\nspecialized in describing visits to the moon. In the moon cities, he\r\nsaid, he met many earth scientists who enjoyed a delightful, relaxed\r\nexistence. The lunar natives use no money, are born without appendixes,\r\nand for entertainment play a game very much like baseball. In science\r\nthey are way ahead of us: using saucers equipped with “self-contained\r\ngravity” and propelled by “processed free energy,” they transported him\r\nfrom earth to moon in only two hours[X-8]. As a trophy of his visit,\r\nMenger brought back a lunar potato. This remarkable vegetable was\r\nsupposed to have five times the protein content of an ordinary American\r\npotato, but unfortunately it was not available for analysis. As soon\r\nas he returned, he said, he had turned it over to the United States\r\nGovernment, and the government was keeping it top secret[X-9].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adamski’s Travels_\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best known of the contactees is George Adamski, who on\r\nthe night of November 20, 1952, in the desert of Southern California,\r\nsupposedly met and talked with the pilot of a vehicle that had just\r\narrived from Venus. Conversation was no problem; both men simply used\r\ntelepathy and sign language when words failed[X-10]. In the years since\r\nthen Adamski has reported many other pleasant chats with visitors\r\nfrom Mars and Saturn as well as Venus, and has allegedly made several\r\njourneys in their spacecraft, including an aerial tour of the moon.\r\nOn this trip he observed with surprise that the moon’s hidden side\r\ncontained fertile country abounding in lakes, rivers, vegetation, and\r\nprosperous cities with people strolling along the sidewalks[X-11]. He\r\nwas not at all disconcerted when the Russian photographs of the moon’s\r\nfar side showed no trace of these delightful features. Obviously,\r\nsaid Adamski, the Russians had simply retouched the pictures before\r\nreleasing them to the world, in order to deceive the United States and\r\nto conceal the vegetation, trees, and buildings of the space people who\r\nhad their bases there[X-12].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 15._ Top, schematic drawing of Adamski’s\r\nVenusian saucer. Bottom, schematic drawing of chicken brooder.]\r\n\r\nClearly aware of possible skepticism, Adamski did not ask the public to\r\naccept his experiences on his unsupported word; as evidence, he offered\r\nvarious photographs showing cigar-shaped objects, a rocky hillside with\r\na white blob on the horizon, and the drawing of a person apparently\r\nclad in coveralls--without the book’s explanation no one would ever\r\nsuspect that he came from the planet Venus. One of the best-known\r\npictures he published showed a bell-shaped “spaceship” with circular\r\nopenings near the top and three large balls on the bottom for landing\r\ngear. By an interesting coincidence, this craft closely resembles a\r\nwell-known type of chicken brooder, whose three infrared bulbs at the\r\nbase look very much like the “landing gear” of the alleged spacecraft\r\n(see Figure 15). When skeptics doubted Adamski’s claim that he had\r\ntraveled from Kansas City, Missouri, to Davenport, Iowa, by flying\r\nsaucer, he displayed one of the most unusual items ever called upon\r\nto prove the existence of spaceships: his uncanceled railway ticket,\r\nfor which he requested a refund![X-13]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Photography and the UFO_\r\n\r\nThose who believe in flying saucers have long hoped to obtain a good\r\nclear photograph that would establish their existence once and for all.\r\nMany “UFO” pictures show vague specks and blurs whose interpretation\r\nis limited only by the imagination of the viewer. Of the many pictures\r\ntaken in good faith and offered in evidence, none shows an indubitable\r\nspaceship. Most of them are genuine photographs showing indistinct\r\nimages of jet planes, birds, balloons, and other objects normally in\r\nthe sky. They are puzzling only until they are compared with similar\r\nphotographs of known jet planes, birds, balloons, and other normal\r\nobjects; then their identity becomes obvious.\r\n\r\nTrick photography has often been called upon to prove the reality of\r\nthe incredible--fairies, ectoplasm, ghosts--and it has also played\r\na part in the history of flying saucers. While the most detailed\r\ncontact stories have usually come from the United States, for some\r\npeculiar reason the best of the faked pictures have come from Europe\r\nand South America. A widely publicized photograph supposedly taken\r\nat Taormina, Sicily, in 1954 shows four men standing on a bridge and\r\napparently gazing at two UFOs soaring overhead [X-14]. The deep shadows\r\ncast by the men and the bridge railing show that the sun was shining\r\nbrilliantly, but the objects in the sky, which look like the inverted\r\ncovers of teapots or sugar bowls, show only faintly shadowed areas.\r\nStranger yet, the shady side of one UFO is on the left, that of the\r\nother UFO on the right. The men on the bridge have their heads tilted\r\nat such an angle that they could not possibly have seen the objects\r\npictured, but are obviously looking at the hill in the background\r\ninstead of at the sky. Even a casual inspection exposes this picture as\r\na crude fake (see Plate VIa).\r\n\r\nAn even cruder fake was offered as evidence to Dr. Menzel in South\r\nAfrica in the summer of 1962. The optimistic photographer insisted that\r\nhe had snapped a genuine saucer on the wing, even though the circular\r\nobject shown in the print was an unmistakable hubcap, the Chevrolet\r\ntrade-mark clearly legible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Isle of Lovers Hoax_\r\n\r\nSome photographic hoaxes are more cleverly executed. In May 1952, a\r\nfew weeks after _Life_ magazine had alarmed the world with its article\r\n“Have We Visitors from Outer Space?”[X-15], the Brazilian weekly\r\npicture magazine _O Cruzeiro_ published startlingly clear photographs\r\nof an alleged flying saucer[X-16]. According to the accompanying story,\r\na reporter and a photographer on the staff of the magazine on May 7\r\nhad visited Ilha dos Amores, an island not far from Rio de Janeiro, to\r\ndo a feature assignment. Late in the afternoon, at a moment when the\r\nphotographer just happened to have his camera pointed at the sky, the\r\nreporter suddenly called his attention to a passing UFO. During the\r\nminute or so the object was in view he obtained five pictures which,\r\nalong with the reporter’s eyewitness story, were released to the public\r\non May 17. If the editors actually believed in the reality of the\r\nsaucer, the ten-day delay before informing the world of its visit is\r\nremarkable. The magazine has never admitted that the photographs were a\r\nhoax, but they inspired doubt even in sympathetic investigators[X-17].\r\n\r\nThe UFO appears in a dull sky above a mountain peak. In the first\r\npicture the object looks like a jet plane surrounded by an exhaust haze\r\nand, with a little imagination, might be called a Saturn-like object.\r\nIn succeeding pictures it resembles the lid of a teapot, or the bottom\r\nview of a rubber stopper for a sink. A study of the shadows quickly\r\nreveals the fraudulent nature of these photographs: the dome on top\r\nof the “saucer” casts its shadow to the right, while the trees and\r\nmountains in the foreground cast their shadows to the left. The picture\r\ncould be authentic only in a peculiar world in which the sun shone from\r\nthe west on objects on the ground, but shone from the east on objects\r\nflying in the sky!\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Trindade Island Saucer_\r\n\r\nThe most famous of all purported photographs of a UFO, the Trindade\r\nIsland saucer, also came from Brazil. First published in Brazilian\r\nnewspapers on February 21, 1958, the pictures showed dark mountain\r\ncrags looming against an overcast sky. Above one peak appeared a\r\nstartling image (much like the _O Cruzeiro_ saucer of 1952) resembling\r\nthe planet Saturn--a flattened sphere banded round the middle by a dark\r\nline that extended like a platform beyond the curved sides. According\r\nto the accompanying news stories, the UFO had flown over the island of\r\nTrindade and had been observed by the officers and crew of a ship of\r\nthe Brazilian Navy. The pictures, taken by a photographer on board, had\r\nbeen examined and supposedly pronounced genuine by Navy experts before\r\nbeing released to the press. Since a responsible military organization\r\nand a major world government thus seemed to accept the photographs\r\nas proof that flying saucers actually existed, the incident raised a\r\nstorm of official inquiry both in Brazil and abroad. Then, within a few\r\nweeks, the storm abruptly subsided. Although no explanation was given,\r\nthe object in the pictures was obviously considered no threat to our\r\nplanet’s security (see Plate VIb).\r\n\r\nAlthough saucer enthusiasts regard these pictures as genuine evidence\r\nfor the reality of UFOs, careful study of the facts strongly suggests\r\nthat this case, which rocked the Brazilian Government and created\r\na short-lived but world-wide saucer scare, was merely an unusually\r\nskillful hoax[X-18].\r\n\r\nAt first glance, the circumstances of the sighting seemed to be\r\nentirely clear and straightforward[X-19]. Trindade is a barren,\r\nmountainous island of about six square miles, about 600 miles from\r\nthe coast of Brazil. Abandoned after the end of the Second World\r\nWar, the island remained deserted except by sea gulls until October\r\n1957, when the Brazilian Navy established an oceanographic post and\r\na meteorological station there to carry out its research for the\r\nInternational Geophysical Year (IGY). To facilitate the oceanographic\r\nstudies, the Navy also converted a training ship, the _Almirante\r\nSaldanha_, into a floating laboratory equipped with scientific\r\napparatus and photographic darkroom. With a crew of about 300, the ship\r\nroutinely traveled between Rio de Janeiro and Trindade Island on its\r\nduties for the IGY.\r\n\r\nA major function of the meteorological station was the launching and\r\ntracking of weather balloons; they were painted red, inflated with\r\nhydrogen, and carried radio transmitters. Launched each morning, they\r\nwere tracked by radio and optical devices to show the movements of the\r\nwinds in the upper atmosphere. At a certain point (when the balloon\r\nburst, or at a prearranged signal) the balloon released a bag of\r\nscientific instruments which, attached to a parachute, floated to the\r\nground to be retrieved.\r\n\r\nThe Trindade station began operation in November 1957. Almost\r\nimmediately, UFOs were reported over the island. (Brazil had not been\r\nimmune to the flying-saucer epidemic that had begun in Texas early that\r\nmonth [see _Chapter_ IX], and sentries at Itaipu Fort, near Santos, on\r\nNovember 4 had reported a UFO that knocked out the lights and electric\r\nplant.) With weather balloons going up daily, parachutes floating down\r\nat odd times, and sea gulls cruising over the island, the advent of\r\nother “saucers” was inevitable. During November and December several\r\nUFOs were reported by workmen, none of whom were trained observers.\r\nAlthough neither Captain Bacellar, the commanding officer at the\r\nstation, nor his officers saw any unidentified objects, he radioed Rio\r\nto report the incidents and investigated each story. Some he found\r\nto be false, some were based on mistaken identification of gulls and\r\nballoons, and in others the evidence was inconclusive.\r\n\r\nEarly in January 1958, when the _Almirante Saldanha_ arrived on\r\nschedule at Trindade, it had on board several civilian guests who were\r\nto collaborate in various aspects of the research. Among them was\r\nAlmiro Barauna, a professional photographer. After several days at\r\nthe island, the ship prepared to leave for the return trip to Rio on\r\nJanuary 16. Shortly after noon Barauna was on deck with his camera,\r\nwaiting to film the departure. The sky was thinly overcast, the sea was\r\nrough, and waves dashing against the ship and the rocky shore created a\r\nnoisy background.\r\n\r\nAccording to the news accounts printed several weeks later, Captain\r\nViegas, of the Brazilian Air Force, suddenly shouted “_Olha o disco!_\r\n[Flying saucer!]” Hearing the shout, Barauna peered at the sky and saw\r\na luminous oval object moving swiftly toward the island. Officers and\r\ncrewmen on deck also observed the UFO, he said, and interfered with\r\nhis aim as they ran about excitedly. Nevertheless he managed to take\r\nsix shots of the UFO as it approached the island, disappeared behind a\r\nmountain peak, reversed direction and reappeared at a lower altitude,\r\nretraced its course, and vanished with incredible speed against the\r\nhorizon. The unknown had arrived and departed in a period of about\r\ntwenty seconds.\r\n\r\nAccording to the news stories, the photographer had retired to the\r\nship’s darkroom under the supervision of an officer to develop\r\nthe negative, and found that four of the six exposures showed the\r\nmysterious object. He was not able to make prints, he said, because the\r\ndarkroom supplies unfortunately did not include any photographic paper.\r\nHowever, he did exhibit the negative, and the officers and crewmen who\r\nexamined it allegedly agreed that it showed the same Saturn-like UFO\r\nthat had flown over the island. After the return to Rio he made prints\r\nand enlargements and turned them over, together with the negative, to\r\nthe Brazilian Navy.\r\n\r\nThe question of authenticity arose immediately. Called down to\r\nIntelligence headquarters for an interview, Barauna underwent a\r\nfour-hour interrogation concerning the pictures. During the questioning\r\nhe was asked, “If you were going to make a flying saucer appear on\r\na negative, how would you proceed?” He replied, as he later told a\r\nreporter, “_Comandante_, I am an able photographer, specialized in\r\ntrick photography, but I could not produce one that would withstand\r\nclose and accurate examination.”[X-18]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this modest disclaimer, some of the photographic evidence\r\nclearly suggested fraud, and a strong difference of opinion developed\r\namong government officials. Some accepted the pictures as a genuine\r\nrecord of a flying saucer; others pronounced them fakes. For several\r\nweeks the incident was kept secret, but when eventually someone took\r\nthe prints to the President of Brazil, further concealment became\r\nimpossible. Yielding to the persuasion of certain military advisers and\r\nnewsmen, and against the advice of the Naval Ministry, he released the\r\npictures to the press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V\r\n\r\n_a._ Pinched lightning, August 1961.

XI)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VIII\r\n\r\n_b._ Ghost images produced by internal reflections in lens system.\r\n(CHAP. XII)]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brazilian Naval Ministry_\r\n\r\nThe photographs were published on February 21, five weeks after they\r\nwere taken. Since the President had apparently accepted them at face\r\nvalue, the Naval Ministry was obviously in a difficult position;\r\nthrough an unofficial spokesman it issued a statement notable for its\r\nlack of enthusiasm:\r\n\r\n“On the morning of January 16, 1958, over the island of Trindade, the\r\ncrew of the school ship _Almirante Saldanha_ sighted an unidentified\r\naerial object for a few seconds. A civilian who was aboard the ship\r\ntook some pictures of the object. The Navy has no connection with the\r\ncase, and its only connection with the occurrence was the fact that the\r\nphotographer was aboard the school ship, and came back with the ship to\r\nRio.”[X-20]\r\n\r\nOn the same day another Navy spokesman released a similar unofficial\r\nstatement to _O Globo_:\r\n\r\n“The news about a flying saucer sighted over the Island of Trindade\r\nwas received here with utmost reserve. There will be an investigation\r\nto verify the authenticity of the sightings and photos. No officer or\r\nsailor from the N.E. _Almirante Saldanha_ witnessed the event.”[X-20]\r\n\r\nImmediately an international furor broke out. Were these pictures\r\nindeed proof of extraterrestrial spaceships, or were they a hoax, with\r\nthe Brazilian President and the Brazilian Navy as victims? Who were\r\nthe witnesses, and exactly what did they report? In the United States,\r\nhigh officials asked for copies of the pictures. An editor of _Look_\r\nmagazine asked Dr. Menzel to fly to Brazil to evaluate the evidence,\r\nbut later canceled the plan when the Rio office advised that the\r\nphotographs were generally considered fraudulent. Public excitement in\r\nBrazil became so great that on February 23 the Naval Ministry released\r\nan official statement, distinguished by its air of caution, which\r\nconcluded:\r\n\r\n“Clearly this Ministry will not be able to make any pronouncement\r\nconcerning the reality of the object seen because the photographs do\r\nnot constitute sufficient proof for this purpose.”[X-18]\r\n\r\nThe day after the pictures were published the _Almirante Saldanha_,\r\nwhich had been lying outside the harbor at Rio, received orders to\r\nsail. Not until February 24, when the ship docked at Santos, did\r\nnewsmen have a chance to interview the officers and crewmen who\r\nallegedly had observed the Trindade saucer and could support Barauna’s\r\nstory. None of them, it turned out, had actually seen the object.\r\n\r\nThe Assistant Naval Attaché of the United States, who was then in\r\nSantos in connection with the visit of the U. S. Coast Guard cutter\r\n_Westwind_, visited the Brazilian ship to collect information about\r\nthe Trindade saucer, but with little success. The commanding officer\r\nstated that he had not seen the alleged UFO; he had seen the pictures\r\nbut refused to express an opinion on their authenticity; he stated\r\nthat his secretary might have seen the UFO but the secretary, when\r\nquestioned, preferred not to discuss the matter. The executive officer\r\nsaid that he had not been on deck at the time of the sighting, but that\r\nother persons might have seen the object.\r\n\r\nDuring the next week arguments for and against the authenticity of\r\nthe photographs filled the Brazilian papers, and _O Globo_ published\r\ndeliberately faked views of a “flying saucer”--a china plate tossed\r\ninto the air. A federal deputy in an official note to the Naval\r\nMinistry deplored their amazing failure to procure sworn statements\r\nfrom the officers and crewmen who were reported to have witnessed the\r\nUFO.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the widespread and increasing skepticism, the weekly\r\nmagazine _O Cruzeiro_ used the Trindade pictures for its lead story in\r\nthe issue of March 8. “Once bitten, twice shy” apparently did not apply\r\nto its editors, who seemed instead to adopt the principle, “In for a\r\npenny, in for a pound.” The photographs, they remarked editorially, not\r\nonly proved the existence of flying saucers, they also established the\r\nauthenticity of the Ilha dos Amores pictures published several years\r\nearlier. As though to emphasize this point, the magazine assigned the\r\nTrindade story and the interviews with witnesses to the same staff\r\nreporter who had described the Ilha dos Amores saucer in 1952. The\r\nNaval Ministry refrained from further comment and, since the military\r\nauthorities showed no alarm about the possibility of extraterrestrial\r\npatrols, public interest in the pictures quickly died.\r\n\r\nThe report sent home by the U. S. Naval Attaché included the comment:\r\n\r\n“There appear to be only two explanations for this peculiar incident,\r\nand the peculiar handling of it by the Brazilian Government: (a) Some\r\noverwhelming power has told the Brazilian Navy not to verify this\r\nincident officially (which they should easily be able to do, if it\r\nactually occurred) or to deny it (which they should easily be able to\r\ndo if it is a fake). I personally do not believe that anyone has told\r\nthe Brazilian Navy to keep quiet about it because there has been no\r\nhint of such suppression in either Brazilian or United States circles.\r\nI also doubt that their control of the individual officers and men\r\nwould be good enough to hold the line in any event. (b) The whole thing\r\nis a fake publicity stunt.... This seems more likely....”[X-18]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Icarai Submarine Hunting Club_\r\n\r\nThe accounts originally printed in the Brazilian papers and in _O\r\nCruzeiro_ contain a number of significant details that have been\r\nglossed over or ignored by UFO enthusiasts, both in Brazil[X-19] and\r\nin the United States[X-21], who apparently accept the Trindade saucer\r\nat face value. A study of the available news stories, facts gathered\r\nby Intelligence officers, and of the photographs themselves leads\r\ninescapably to the conclusion that the Trindade Island photographs were\r\nalmost certainly a hoax.\r\n\r\nAlmiro Barauna was a free-lance photographer. A professional of unusual\r\nskill, he had long been interested in flying saucers and, some time\r\nbefore the Trindade incident, he had published a purposely humorous\r\nmagazine article entitled “A Flying Saucer Hunted Me at Home” and\r\nillustrated by admittedly faked photographs. He had also published\r\ntrick photographs of “treasure chests” lying on the ocean bottom. In\r\naddition, Barauna specialized in underwater photography and was a\r\nmember of the Icarai Submarine Hunting Club, a group interested in skin\r\ndiving and the study of life on the ocean floor.\r\n\r\nWhen the _Almirante Saldanha_ left Rio for its historic January visit\r\nto Trindade Island, the ship had on board, as guests of the Navy, five\r\nmembers of the Icarai Club. Among the five, in addition to Barauna,\r\nwere Amilar Vieira Filho, captain of the group, and José Teobaldo\r\nViegas, a retired captain in the Brazilian Air Force[X-22]. On January\r\n16 when the ship was getting ready to leave Trindade, these three\r\nfriends were on deck, Barauna with his loaded Rolleiflex camera, the\r\nother two standing some distance away. Suddenly Vieira remarked on\r\na big sea gull in the sky. Looking up, Viegas immediately shouted,\r\n“Flying saucer!” and Barauna snapped his pictures.\r\n\r\nNo other eyewitnesses have been found, even though the deck was\r\ncrowded with sailors. The ship’s dentist has been listed as a witness\r\n(in one document he appears as two persons, under two different\r\nversions of his name) but no newspaper yet examined mentions his story.\r\nCaptain Bacellar, returning from his post as commander of the Trindade\r\nstation, has also been listed as a witness but, according to his\r\nstatement, he was not on deck when the incident occurred.\r\n\r\nVieira, the first man to sight the object, had called it “a big sea\r\ngull.” When interviewed five weeks later, in the midst of the saucer\r\nexcitement, he had changed his mind about its being a sea gull, but he\r\nwas no longer certain just what he had seen. He stated that the unknown\r\nhad been in view for twenty seconds at most, and had disappeared too\r\nquickly for him to note any details; it was simply an oval gray object\r\nthat seemed to flash briefly before it vanished. He did not mention the\r\nSaturn-like bands around the middle that are a conspicuous feature of\r\nthe photograph.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Trindade Photographs_\r\n\r\nAccounts of the Trindade affair often remark that the photographs\r\nmust be genuine because no opportunity for fraud occurred. On the\r\ncontrary, there were ample and repeated opportunities. Since Barauna\r\nwas not under observation when he loaded his camera, he could easily\r\nhave inserted a prepared film, with no one the wiser. With the type of\r\ncamera used, the operation would have been simple. He was again free\r\nfrom observation when he developed the negatives. Captain Bacellar\r\nescorted him to the door of the darkroom but remained outside, on guard\r\nat the door. The only person to accompany Barauna inside (to help by\r\nholding a flashlight) was his friend Viegas--the same man who had cried\r\n“Flying saucer!”\r\n\r\nWhen Barauna emerged with the dripping film, Bacellar examined it but\r\nwhat he expected to find is a question, since he had not observed the\r\nUFO. The witnesses allegedly agreed, however, that the negatives showed\r\nthe object they had seen in the sky--an amazing feat when we remember\r\nthat the Rolleiflex film frame is small, only about 2.25 inches square.\r\n\r\nIn the print of Frame 3 shown in _O Cruzeiro_[X-22], the UFO is\r\nslightly more than ¼ inch long and less than ⅛ inch thick. Assuming an\r\nenlargement factor of a little more than three, we find that the UFO on\r\nthe negative would have appeared merely as a pale blur about 1/16 of an\r\ninch in length and no thicker than a pencil line. Miraculous eyesight\r\nwould have been required to distinguish a “Saturn-like” or any other\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nThe Navy’s officers on board showed astonishingly little interest in\r\nthe film and did nothing to prevent the possibility of fraud. All\r\nduring the homeward trip the photographer had both the camera and the\r\nnegative in his own possession. When the ship stopped at Santos, he\r\nand his fellow club members were allowed to debark (with camera and\r\nnegative), and they completed the journey to Rio by bus. The ship had\r\nbeen anchored at Rio for two days before Captain Bacellar, of the\r\nTrindade station, finally called on Barauna and asked to see the prints\r\nso that he could show them to the Navy. Thus the photographer had been\r\nfree of supervision for days. In that time he could have produced\r\npictures of little men from Mars, if he had wanted to.\r\n\r\nThe pictures themselves raise many questions. The three witnesses had\r\nemphasized the brilliance of the UFO, yet the prints show merely a gray\r\nshape with no suggestion of luminosity. Barauna had used a Rolleiflex\r\ncamera, 2.8 Model E, f/8 lens, set at 125. Finding that he had\r\noverexposed the film, he said, he had treated the negative with silver\r\nsalts after development in order to increase the contrast. (During this\r\nprocedure he was, again, without official supervision.)\r\n\r\nThe prints used in _O Cruzeiro_ have obviously been cropped since,\r\nunlike the film frames, they are not square. Frame 1 shows the UFO\r\nabove the sea, some distance from the island; Frame 2 shows the\r\nUFO above rocky crags, at the right of a peak. Frame 3 shows it at\r\nthe right of the peak but at lower altitude. Frames 4 and 5, not\r\nreproduced, did not show the object, and in Frame 6 the UFO is a mere\r\nspeck low on the horizon.\r\n\r\nFrame 3, the only one showing the Saturn-like shape, deserves special\r\nattention. In the published print the mountains in the foreground are\r\nquite clear, while the UFO is little more than a dark line with an\r\nindistinct beginning and end, with a faint suggestion of rounding at\r\ntop and bottom; without the dark line the curves would scarcely be\r\nvisible, so completely does the object merge into the background of\r\novercast sky. The picture widely distributed by news agencies is a\r\nfurther enlargement of the section containing the UFO. In the enlarged\r\nsection, the foreground rocks are a mere black blur, but the UFO has\r\ngained greatly in clarity. The central band is darker, particularly at\r\nthe left, and the outlines of the object are no longer vague.\r\n\r\nThe Navy’s study of the negatives revealed several dubious features.\r\nThe details of the land in the foreground were very sharp but the UFO\r\ndisk was hazy, showed little contrast, and was essentially without\r\nshadows. The object in Frame 2 seemed to have been inverted, as\r\ncompared with Frames 1 and 3. From the reported high velocity of the\r\nsaucer and the fast shutter speed, some lateral haziness might have\r\nbeen expected, but no such blurring appeared.\r\n\r\nExactly when and how the fraudulent images were produced--if they were\r\nfraudulent--cannot be known. Experienced photographers can easily think\r\nof a dozen possible devices. The probability that they were faked is\r\noverwhelming and, but for the embarrassing fact that the Brazilian\r\nPresident had seemed to sponsor them publicly, the Naval Ministry would\r\nundoubtedly have exposed the entire hoax.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the facts are these: The man who made the Trindade pictures\r\nhad no connection with the Brazilian Navy; he was a professional\r\nphotographer noted particularly as an expert at trick photography. No\r\nofficer or crewman of the Brazilian Navy reported seeing the UFO; in\r\naddition to the photographer, only two persons are on record as actual\r\neyewitnesses; both of them were personal friends of the photographer;\r\nneither of them had any connection with the Brazilian Navy. The\r\nphotographer had ample time and many opportunities to fake the\r\npictures. A Rolleiflex camera can easily be used for double exposures.\r\nA series of pictures of a model saucer against a dark background could\r\nbe rerolled and exposed a second time to provide the background, an\r\nold and well-known photographic trick. The pictures themselves show\r\ninternal inconsistencies. The Brazilian Naval Ministry never accepted\r\nthe pictures as authentic records of a flying saucer.[C]\r\n\r\n[C] During a visit to Rio de Janeiro in February 1963, Dr. Menzel\r\ndiscussed this case with some of Brazil’s leading astronomers; they\r\nconcurred in the view that the Trindade saucer was a hoax.\r\n\r\nThe final paragraph from a United States Intelligence report provides\r\nperhaps the most appropriate comment on the affair:\r\n\r\n“It is the reporting officer’s private opinion that a flying saucer\r\nsighting would be unlikely at the very barren island of Trindade, since\r\neveryone knows that Martians are extremely comfort-loving creatures.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Project Ozma_\r\n\r\nAstronomers have found no evidence suggesting that intelligent life\r\nexists on any of earth’s sister planets. Most scientists would agree,\r\nhowever, that life of some kind probably does exist in other parts\r\nof our galaxy and in other galaxies. Even if this probability were\r\ncertainty and space travel were possible over the vast distances we\r\nmeasure in light years, the chance that earthman and alien will ever\r\nestablish physical contact remains infinitesimally small. An explorer\r\n(whether from earth or from a planet of another sun) would have to\r\nbegin by locating, among the millions of stars in the heavens, a\r\nparticular star that had a family of life-bearing planets. If he were\r\nable to identify one of these needles in the cosmic haystack, he\r\nwould next have to find out which of the planets supported living,\r\nintelligent organisms. If he could find the planet and set down his\r\nspaceship, the explorer would then have to try to identify and to\r\ncommunicate with creatures that might be unimaginably strange--so\r\nstrange that he would not recognize them as either living or\r\nintelligent.\r\n\r\nAt present, only light waves and radio waves can bridge the immensities\r\nof space. Physical travel to other star systems is not now and may\r\nnever be possible. Nevertheless, men are making attempts to find out\r\nwhether other intelligent beings do exist outside the solar system\r\nand, if so, where. The earliest effort, known as Project Ozma, started\r\na few years ago at the National Radio Astronomy Observatory at Green\r\nBank, West Virginia. As the first step in a systematic search, the\r\nastronomers began to listen for possible radio signals from the\r\nneighborhood of certain stars. Tau Ceti, Epsilon Eridani, and 61 Cygni\r\nwere chosen as the first targets because they lie within range of our\r\nradio telescopes--ten to eleven light years distant--and because they\r\nresemble our own sun in age and type and therefore might have planetary\r\nsystems not unlike our own. So far, the radio telescopes have detected\r\nno phenomena that might be interpreted as artificial signals.\r\n\r\nThe problems involved are incredibly difficult. A background of radio\r\nnoise--“swishes,” “whistles,” “tweeks”--comes in constantly from the\r\nuniverse at large. Deliberate signals, if they occurred, would be hard\r\nto distinguish from the random noise. Even if signals came in and\r\nwere detected, they might still be indecipherable just as the written\r\nrecords of some early civilizations on our own planet remain a mystery.\r\nEgyptian hieroglyphs were meaningless pictures for millennia until\r\nthe Rosetta stone provided the key, less than 200 years ago. The many\r\npages of text and pictures left by the Mayan Indians cannot yet be\r\nread, except for some dates and a few astronomical symbols. Hundreds\r\nof inscriptions exist in the Etruscan language, written in an alphabet\r\nthat resembles the familiar Greek, but scholars have deciphered only a\r\nfew words.\r\n\r\nIf we are not able to interpret the records devised and set down by\r\nhuman beings like ourselves, we will not easily understand signals that\r\nmight possibly be broadcast by aliens from the planets of other suns.\r\n\r\n[X-1] Wiener, J.

Disabled or\r\nwrecked flying saucers have occasionally been reported, but the debris\r\nand bodies to be expected from such incidents have never been located.\r\n\r\nA “mummified man,” sometimes referred to as proof of such a\r\ncatastrophe, may be seen at Caspar, Wyoming. Found in the Rocky\r\nMountains in the autumn of 1932, this little creature measures 6½\r\ninches high in a sitting position and weighs three-quarters of a pound.\r\nPaleontologists recognize it as _Hesperopithecus_, an anthropoid\r\ndenizen of earth during the Pliocene period. The mummified body of\r\nanother such creature, supposedly found in Arizona, has also been\r\ncalled the remains of “a little green man.”[XI-1] In 1952 four\r\nspaceships were supposed to have crashed in the deserts of New Mexico\r\nand Arizona, carrying the bodies of thirty-four “little men”[XI-2],\r\nbut the only evidence offered for this disaster was a chunk of\r\n“unknown metal” that proved to be ordinary aluminum, and the entire\r\ndrama was shown to be the work of a known hoaxer[XI-3]. Although a\r\nfew flying-saucer organizations regard such “humanoid” evidence with\r\nsome doubt, others, such as the Aerial Phenomena Research Organization\r\n(APRO) are less skeptical of the reality of “little men.”[XI-4]\r\n\r\nUFO publications have reported the finding of various substances\r\nalleged to have been produced by UFOs. The offices of Air Force\r\ninvestigators at Dayton house a small museum of such “pieces of\r\nsaucers”--old batteries, meteorites, parts of primitive radios, rocks,\r\ncorroded lead pipe, tangles of wire, strips of tin foil. Although\r\na few of these specimens have been sent in by optimistic hoaxers,\r\nmost of them have been submitted by genuinely puzzled citizens. When\r\nanalysis shows the normal origin of such an object, the finder usually\r\naccepts the verdict calmly, whether he is disappointed or relieved,\r\nbut occasionally he rejects the identification and indignantly accuses\r\nthe Air Force of theft, substitution, or plain lying to suppress the\r\n“truth.” Nevertheless, not a single fragment studied so far--animal,\r\nvegetable, or mineral--shows any evidence that it grew or was\r\nconstructed on an alien world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Angel Hair and Spiders_\r\n\r\nSome centuries ago the primitive inhabitants of the Hawaiian Islands,\r\nobserving the feathery, hairlike threads of volcanic glass left on\r\nthe ground from ancient eruptions, accounted for the substance by\r\nthe legend that the goddess Pelee had once stopped somewhere in the\r\nneighborhood to comb her hair. “Angel hair,” a term in UFO parlance\r\nused to describe any unfamiliar fibers, strands, threads, liquids,\r\ngranules, and powders found on the earth and supposedly deposited from\r\nflying saucers, offers an interesting analogy.\r\n\r\n_Fils de la Vierge_--the hair of the Virgin Mary--is the usual French\r\nphrase for gossamer or cobwebs, whose origin was long a mystery.\r\nSimilarly the English “gossamer” commonly means cobwebs. According to\r\none source, the word may be derived from _gaze à Marie_--the gauze of\r\nMary. According to legend, cobwebs were formed from threads that fell\r\nfrom the shroud of the Virgin Mary on her Assumption. UFO enthusiasts\r\nin France began to use _fils de la Vierge_ in 1952, to describe the\r\ncobwebby material that allegedly fell from flying saucers. Translators\r\nof the French UFO publications, instead of using the English equivalent\r\n“gossamer” or “cobwebs,” chose to create the new term “angel hair”\r\nwhich, unlike the French, implies an entirely strange substance, one\r\nthat has no apparent connection with such ordinary earthly phenomena as\r\nspiders.\r\n\r\nTwo remarkable falls of angel hair were reported in France on October\r\n17 and 27, 1952. In both incidents, witnesses observed in the sky a\r\nstrangely shaped, cottony cloud at a height of several thousand feet.\r\nAbove it was a long, narrow, cylindrical object trailed by a white\r\nplume, moving slowly across the sky and accompanied by twenty or thirty\r\nsmaller objects that looked like puffs of smoke. Following a broken\r\npath, they made rapid zigzag motions, and left a broad ribbon of\r\nwhite substance that slowly drifted to the ground and clung to trees,\r\ntelephone wires, and roofs of houses. These masses of white threads\r\nwere described as like wool, nylon, or Fiberglas. When rolled into a\r\nball they became gelatinous and disappeared within a few hours; set on\r\nfire, they burned like cellophane.\r\n\r\nOne witness was able to disentangle a single strand more than ten yards\r\nlong. None of the material, unfortunately, was preserved for study.\r\n\r\nStudents of UFOs pondered the unusual phenomenon: “If the observers\r\nreally did see what they described, and if all these objects were\r\nmachines guided by a single intelligence, then what mysterious\r\nexperiment were they performing? What purpose was served by the strange\r\nballet of paired saucers? What was the meaning of the whitish streak\r\nappearing between two saucers on separation? What, finally, was the\r\n‘angel’s hair’ that sublimed so readily in the air?”[XI-5, p. 150]\r\nUFO enthusiasts have suggested various theories of the nature and\r\norigin of the mysterious substance. According to one hypothesis[XI-5,\r\np. 149], angel hair might be produced in the wake of a spacecraft\r\nmoving in a force field; ionization of the atmosphere would produce\r\nultraheavy particles which would react with ordinary air to form a\r\nkind of precipitate-angel hair--which would disintegrate as ionization\r\ndecreased (see _Chapter_ IX). Another theory suggests that angel hair\r\nmight be a chain polymer of cellulose containing radioactive carbon 14\r\n(the carbon 14 being produced by the action of cosmic rays on atoms\r\nof nitrogen in the atmosphere), hydrogen, and oxygen from moisture in\r\nthe air, the three elements combining under the action of ultraheavy\r\nparticles produced by ionization[XI-6]. This theory overlooks the fact\r\nthat cellulose is not formed from a combination of carbon dioxide,\r\noxygen, and hydrogen in air. Rather, it is made by living organisms in\r\na series of complicated enzymic reactions. Even if cellulose could be\r\nmade by the hypothetical reaction suggested, it would contain no more\r\ncarbon 14 than does the ordinary carbon dioxide in the air.\r\n\r\nTo French entomologists, the angel hair seen in October 1952, was\r\nno mystery at all. The objects dancing the strange ballet were not\r\nspaceships, but spiders. Far from performing a mysterious experiment,\r\nthey were merely carrying out the well-established routine of migration.\r\n\r\nEach year the young spiders of most species leave the nests of their\r\ninfancy and prepare to establish their own homes. Crawling by the\r\nhundreds or the thousands to the tops of fence posts, walls, or trees,\r\nthey spin long silken webs which, inflated by the air, carry the tiny\r\nemigrants up from the ground. These gossamer parachutes drift up and\r\nalong on rising air currents, sometimes to great heights; they may\r\nsoar for a few yards or for many miles over hills and valleys. These\r\nmigrating balloonists have been observed as high as 14,000 feet, and\r\nat sea 200 miles from any land. Eventually drifting back to earth,\r\nthe spiders detach the now useless parachutes and move off to build\r\nnew nests for the coming year, while the abandoned gossamer may pile\r\nup in great masses on trees, fences, telephone wires, and ground, to\r\ndecay and vanish in a matter of hours. These gossamer showers sometimes\r\ninclude so many outworn webs that the filmy blankets of fine silk may\r\nbe several inches deep and may cover an entire landscape like snow.\r\n\r\nThese migrations occur in spring or, more frequently, in autumn--but\r\nonly when the weather is exactly right. Spiders may sit patiently for\r\ndays, waiting for a calm, clear, windless day. On such days the steady\r\nupward currents of air from the sun-warmed ground carry the spiders\r\ngently aloft[XI-7]. The association of angel hair with UFO sightings is\r\ncompletely natural. The drifting patches of gossamer reflect the sun\r\nbrilliantly. A whole armada of saucers can appear overhead and then\r\nvanish as the gossamer cascades to earth.\r\n\r\nThe description of the material and the date of the fall both indicate\r\nthat the angel hair observed in France in October 1952 was of arachnid\r\norigin. Even the weather was exactly right--“superb, with a sky of\r\ncloudless blue”--for the migration of a smother of spiders.\r\n\r\nA similar fall of angel hair occurred in the United States on October\r\n22, 1954, near a school in Marysville, Ohio. At afternoon recess the\r\npupils of the Jerome Elementary School noticed a dazzlingly bright\r\nobject in the sky. It disappeared, and for the next forty-five minutes\r\nboth children and teachers watched white, cottonlike tufts floating\r\nslowly down to the ground. The material was in long strands, very fine\r\nand soft, could be stretched and rolled into a tiny ball, but quickly\r\nvanished to nothing and left a green stain on the hands. The stuff clung\r\nto grass and cars, draped the telephone wires for a distance of three\r\nmiles, and was like a misty canopy over the road[XI-6].\r\n\r\nUnfortunately none of the material was preserved and no analysis was\r\npossible. Marysville is near Columbus, Ohio, an industrial center,\r\nand the stuff might have been waste products from one of the many\r\nfactories. Since similar falls were reported in Indiana during the same\r\nperiod, the substance more probably was gossamer. As in the French\r\nincidents, the time was late October and the weather was perfect, a\r\nwarm autumn day with a sunny, cloudless sky. Both the time and the\r\nweather were ideal for migrating spiders to take to the air, float down\r\nto earth on their fluffy parachutes, and then discard the no longer\r\nnecessary _fils de la Vierge_.\r\n\r\nMany falls of angel hair that occur in the warm days of Indian\r\nsummer are probably abandoned gossamer. It is significant that of\r\nfourteen such incidents reported in Europe and the United States, all\r\nbut three took place in October and November, the season of spider\r\nmigration[XI-6]. In one of the three incidents reported in other months\r\n(Horseheads, New York, February 21, 1955) the angel hair was identified\r\nas waste products from the local milk plant.\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent reports of angel hair came from Sebree,\r\nKentucky, on September 11, 1962, when state police and the local Civil\r\nDefense director were called in to investigate a strange substance that\r\nlooked like spun glass, which had been floating down near the residence\r\nof Mr. Y in great quantities for more than an hour. The Air Force, when\r\ncalled for advice, suggested three possibilities: the material might\r\nbe chemicals used in cloud seeding, might be refuse from a defective\r\nfilter in a chemical or industrial plant, or might be gossamer formed\r\nby migrating spiders. The first two possibilities were quickly ruled\r\nout. The witnesses, when requestioned, remembered that they had indeed\r\nnoticed spiders clinging to several bits of the material they had\r\npicked up. The troopers’ report concluded, “It is the belief of this\r\nunit the substance observed was gossamer formed by huge quantities of\r\nmigrating spiders moving, which is normal for this season.”\r\n\r\nThe yearly migration of spiders and sloughing of gossamer is an\r\nestablished fact. As an explanation of angel hair it is far less\r\nfantastic than a still-hypothetical cruising spaceship.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Varieties of Angel Hair_\r\n\r\nSeveral types of angel hair not of arachnid origin have been reported\r\nin industrial areas, particularly in and near cities that have textile\r\nfactories. When the filtering system of such a factory fails to work\r\nproperly, lint and waste residues may be thrown into the air to be\r\ncarried away by the wind and eventually deposited on the ground.\r\nDrifting fibers of nylon, rayon, and other fabrics can mystify an\r\nobserver, especially if the residues break and disappear when touched.\r\nSome cities, such as Cincinnati, maintain an Air Pollution Center to\r\ndeal with the problems resulting from air contamination by industrial\r\nwastes. Scientists at this and other centers often collaborate with\r\nATIC in identifying unknown substances reported in connection with UFOs.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon of September 25, 1956, a housewife in Cincinnati\r\nnoticed a strange substance floating down into her yard, a white,\r\nfibrous material that curled when she touched it. Wondering if she\r\nhad found some angel hair, she described the incident to the editors\r\nof _Orbit_, a saucer publication; in addition, she collected some of\r\nthe material in a jar and sent it to the Air Force for analysis[XI-8].\r\nWorking in collaboration with the Air Pollution Center at Cincinnati,\r\nATIC investigators subjected the material to chemical and microscopic\r\ntests and identified it as waste products from fibers of cuprammonium\r\n(Bemberg) rayon, from a local industrial plant[XI-9].\r\n\r\nThe possible varieties of angel hair increase with the development of\r\nnew technologies. During March and April 1959, the Air Force received\r\nmany reports that flying saucers were cruising over the mountains near\r\nCoburn, Virginia, regularly used a landing strip on an inaccessible\r\npeak of Sheep Rock Mountain, and frequently dropped angel hair on\r\nthe nearby countryside. The investigating officer collected some of\r\nthe material and identified it as a type of “window,” the rolls or\r\nlong strips of aluminum foil used by the military in World War II to\r\nproduce spurious radar echoes and confuse enemy anti-aircraft fire. The\r\nCoburn angel hair was identical with the foil used by Air Force planes\r\ncarrying out experiments in the area. “Window” falls very slowly;\r\ndropped from a height of 40,000 feet, it may easily be visible for\r\nsome time to ground observers, as well as interfere with local radar\r\nreception[XI-10].\r\n\r\nA similar angel-hair incident was reported on November 23, 1960,\r\nwhen many residents in southern Michigan and the Midwest reported a\r\nmysterious, glowing white object in the eastern sky that was dropping\r\nstrange material to the earth. Witnesses described the object variously\r\nas a comet, a satellite with a tail, or a saucer-shaped UFO. The\r\nangel hair was quickly identified as foil dropped by planes that were\r\nconducting a test of radar reception[XI-11].\r\n\r\nReports of angel hair still come in occasionally to ATIC and, if\r\nthe explanation is not immediately obvious, are investigated. On\r\nthe afternoon of October 12, 1959, officials at Robins Air Force\r\nBase, Georgia, received a telephone call stating that unidentified\r\nsubstances were falling from unknown objects in the sky near the town\r\nof Washington. Two Air Force investigators arrived in the town before\r\nevening to interview the witnesses and examine the material.\r\n\r\nThe first sighting had occurred shortly before noon, when a farm woman\r\nnoticed an object in the sky, traveling not particularly fast from\r\nsoutheast to west. A stream of peculiar-looking substance, broad as the\r\nvapor trail of a jet plane, was trailing behind and floating toward the\r\nearth. The object itself was “as large as a football,” brown or black\r\nin color, and maintained a perfectly straight, even course. A few hours\r\nlater in a town a few miles northeast, a man mowing his lawn noticed on\r\nthe grass two whitish-gray streaks about ten feet long and eight inches\r\nwide, extending from east to west. Deciding that the peculiar streaks\r\nwere a fungus or a mold, he mowed across them; at once a gray dust rose\r\nabout twenty inches into the air and then settled back to earth.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force investigators took samples of the dusty earth and grass\r\nfor analysis. Chemical tests showed the presence of silver iodide.\r\nFinding silver in such an unlikely place posed a problem, but it\r\nalso pointed the way to a solution. Silver iodide and other silver\r\nhalides are used in cloud seeding to produce rain; long “plumes” of\r\nthis material, ejected from planes, have been successfully tracked in\r\nmountainous country for distances of thirty-five miles downwind. A\r\nfew questions in the right places produced the answer: research teams\r\nfrom the University of Georgia at Athens and from the Lockheed plant\r\nat Marietta had been in the air that day, carrying out experiments\r\nin cloud seeding. The angel hair was the silver iodide used in the\r\nexperiment[XI-10].\r\n\r\nAngel hair of less mysterious origin has now found its way into the\r\nculinary world. The restaurant of the Hotel Bristol in Córdoba,\r\nArgentina, offers “Angel-hair soup,” very fine threadlike spaghetti in\r\nchicken broth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Wisconsin Pancakes_\r\n\r\nOf the many substances offered the public as proof of extraterrestrial\r\nvisitors, probably few have evoked more publicity than the Wisconsin\r\npancakes. According to a plumber named Joe Simonton, of Eagle River,\r\nWisconsin, a flying saucer with three peculiarly dressed occupants\r\nappeared in his yard on April 18, 1961, and hovered a few feet above\r\nthe ground. When one of the saucermen indicated by sign language that\r\nhe was thirsty and held out a two-handled jug, Simonton obligingly\r\nfilled it with well water and handed it back. Looking through the open\r\nhatchway, he saw another spaceman cooking something on a kind of grill.\r\nWhen the spaceman noticed the terrestrial’s interest, he presented him\r\nwith three “pancakes” from the grill--thin, oblong, greasy, rubbery\r\npastries perforated by small round holes and smelling strongly of\r\ngoose grease. The saucer then departed. Although Simonton’s curiosity\r\napparently stopped short of tasting these gifts, he took them to a\r\nfriend of his in Eagle River, a county judge and a member in good\r\nstanding of the National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena\r\n(NICAP)[XI-12].\r\n\r\nEager to learn whether the flapjacks came from this world or another,\r\nthe judge promptly mailed one of them to NICAP headquarters in\r\nWashington, D.C., explained its history and requested an analysis. At\r\nthe same time he gave the story, as far as it went, to the newspapers.\r\nAfter two weeks of anxious waiting, on May 7 he again wrote to NICAP,\r\nprotesting their failure to acknowledge his parcel and demanding either\r\nan analysis or the pancake. This time he received a prompt reply:\r\nNICAP deplored the publicity involving the organization with such a\r\nfantastic-sounding claim, but agreed to send the stuff to a chemist.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile time was passing and pancakes, at least terrestrial ones,\r\ndon’t last forever. Without waiting for the report from the chemist\r\nthe judge submitted one of the remaining pancakes to Air Force\r\ninvestigators of UFOs. On May 25--the cakes were now more than a\r\nmonth old--he wrote a third letter, excoriating NICAP for its lack of\r\nenthusiasm over the evidence, and sent a carbon copy to Ray Palmer,\r\neditor of _Flying Saucers_, who in the early days of UFOs had been\r\ntheir staunch proponent (see _Chapter_ II). The magazine promptly\r\npublished the letter, with comments, as well as an editorial that\r\nsolemnly reproached NICAP for its attitude toward contactee stories in\r\ngeneral[XI-13].\r\n\r\nIf the magazine and the judge had planned the entire episode\r\ndeliberately to embarrass NICAP, they could not have timed it better.\r\nBusy trying to promote a Congressional hearing on flying saucers, NICAP\r\napparently had no time, facilities, or inclination to investigate\r\nflapjacks of such dubious origin. Interrupted by phone calls, besieged\r\nby reporters, and generally harassed, NICAP mailed the cake to an Ohio\r\nphysics professor, a member of the organization, in the hope that he\r\ncould induce his colleague in the chemistry department to analyze the\r\ncake. Since the chemistry professor was ill, the physics professor\r\nreturned the specimen to headquarters in Washington. Old and tired as\r\nit must have been by this time, the cake then was dispatched to New\r\nYork to another NICAP member, a chemist, who began some preliminary\r\ntests.\r\n\r\nSometime during these weeks the Air Force announced the results of\r\nits analysis. The pancakes consisted of starch, fat, buckwheat hulls,\r\nsoybean hulls, wheat bran, and other common substances; bacteriological\r\nand radiation readings were normal[XI-14]. Obviously the specimen\r\nhad been an ordinary pancake fried on earth--or else the spacemen’s\r\nhome planet produced grains that are indistinguishable from those\r\nflourishing on earth.\r\n\r\nNICAP, however, had the last word. Preliminary tests by their chemist\r\nhad shown that the cakes contained a common type of hydrogenated\r\noil shortening that melted at body temperature. Further tests were\r\ntemporarily delayed because of the expense. However, NICAP assured the\r\njudge, the tests would be completed sometime, and any fragments left\r\nover would be saved and returned![XI-15]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Moon Bridge_\r\n\r\nOn the evening of July 29, 1953, Mr. J. J. O’Neill, a science reporter\r\nfor the New York _Herald Tribune_, was looking at the moon through his\r\nsmall telescope when he saw what he believed to be a shaft of light\r\nshining from the mountainous ridge above the Mare Crisium crater and\r\nfanning out into the shadowed area of the crater wall. According to his\r\ninterpretation, the light was coming from underneath a new structure, a\r\ngigantic natural bridge twelve to twenty miles long that arched over a\r\ngap in the mountainous rim. This region of the moon had been thoroughly\r\nstudied and mapped during the previous century and no such feature had\r\never been noticed. The sudden appearance of so spectacular an object,\r\nif true, would indeed require explanation. Alerted by news reports of\r\nthe moon bridge, a British amateur astronomer, H. P. Wilkins, reported\r\na few weeks later that he, too, could see the mysterious arch through\r\nhis telescope (see Figure 16).\r\n\r\nTo saucer enthusiasts these reports constituted proof that the moon was\r\ninhabited. Since Nature alone could not have formed such an arch in so\r\nshort a time, they argued, the bridge must be artificial. The structure\r\nmight have been built by creatures living on the moon, perhaps in\r\nenormous underground cities. These beings might be native Selenites,\r\nor they might be colonists from Mars or from planets belonging to\r\nanother solar system who were using the moon as a base for their\r\nspaceships[XI-16].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 16._ The “Moon Bridge.” A, Just before sunset\r\nlight fans out from beneath “arch”; B, the fan narrows as sun sinks\r\nlower; C, fan begins to disappear as sun sets below horizon. (Based on\r\nsketches by the late H. P. Wilkins.)]\r\n\r\nProfessional astronomers, queried about the mysterious bridge, pointed\r\nout that sunlight could not have produced the phenomenon in the way\r\ndescribed. When a bright lamp shines through an open doorway into a\r\ndarkened room, the light spreads out like a fan into the shadowed area\r\nbecause the light source is very near. But the supposed light source\r\nin this case was the far-distant sun. If a shaft of sunlight were\r\nshining under a huge lunar arch, as claimed, the opposite boundaries\r\nof the illuminated area would be essentially parallel, not divergent\r\nlike the fan-shaped region described. Examining the Mare Crisium\r\nwall through the fifteen-inch Harvard telescope, Dr. Menzel (who was\r\ntherefore labeled “one of the Army stooges”[XI-16a]) concluded that\r\nthe bright area observed by the amateurs must have been a high plateau\r\nthat was still illuminated by the setting sun while the rest of the\r\ncrater wall was already in darkness. The roughly curved boundary of\r\nthe illuminated plateau, seen against the shadowed mountains, had\r\nbeen mistakenly interpreted as a bridge. Dr. G. P. Kuiper, one of the\r\nworld’s leading authorities on the moon, also studied the area with the\r\neighty-two-inch reflecting telescope at the McDonald Observatory, and\r\nreached the same conclusion.\r\n\r\nOne writer offered further proof (derived from an unnamed source)\r\nfor the reality of the new bridge. Astronomers at Mount Palomar\r\nObservatory, he asserted, had made a secret study that confirmed the\r\npresence of the structure; furthermore a spectrographic analysis was\r\nsupposed to have proved that the bridge was made of metal[XI-16].\r\n\r\nSensible comment on these statements is not easy. A “secret” study\r\nwould be impossible since the moon’s face is obviously open to all\r\nviewers, and the purported chemical analysis is sheer nonsense. The\r\nspectroscope can tell the physicist what luminous gases are present\r\nin the atmosphere around a heavenly body, but it cannot reveal the\r\ncomposition of a solid object on the surface of the body, unless the\r\nobject is first heated until it vaporizes and is transformed into gas.\r\nBefore a physicist could make a spectrographic analysis of the alleged\r\nlunar structure, he would have to land on the moon and chip off a piece\r\nof the “bridge” itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Pieces of Saucers_”\r\n\r\nIn UFO publications, any oddly shaped chunk of rock or metal is\r\nlikely to be described as a fragment of an interplanetary craft. A\r\nsix-inch meteorite that fell at Sylacauga, Alabama, (_Chapter_ V)\r\nhas been classified in one saucer book as an “unidentified crashed\r\nobject.”[XI-16] By peculiar reverse logic, sometimes the absence of a\r\nsolid fragment is adduced as equally valid evidence of flying saucers.\r\nThe green fireballs of New Mexico (_Chapter_ V) were identified as\r\nspacecraft partly because they did not leave material traces on the\r\nground. Similarly, when a small object apparently struck and went\r\nthrough a metal signboard in New Haven, Connecticut, on August 19,\r\n1953, the object itself could not be found. Nevertheless, from a study\r\nof the size and shape of the hole and the material around the hole,\r\nsaucer investigators, with more than Sherlockian skill, concluded that\r\nthe object must have been a missile from outer space.\r\n\r\nTo identify “pieces of saucers,” a new pseudoscience has now developed\r\nwhich we may call “xenochemistry,” the interpretation of substances\r\nallegedly from other planets. In xenochemistry, a full qualitative and\r\nquantitative analysis is usually not performed and exact results are\r\nnot made public. From an identification and sometimes a quantitative\r\nestimate of one or two of the elements present in the specimen, the\r\ninvestigator infers the nature of the rest and treats the inference\r\nas proved fact. On the basis of this “analysis” he concludes that the\r\nobject, before it entered our atmosphere, must have had a certain\r\nchemical composition that is unknown or impossible on earth and that\r\nthe object therefore came from another planet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Silver Rain in Brazil_\r\n\r\nOne of the most publicized substances to be analyzed in this way was\r\nthe “silver rain” that allegedly fell from an unidentified flying\r\nobject in Brazil. The incident occurred on December 13, 1954, in the\r\ncity of Campinas and the witness was a housewife but, as in many UFO\r\nsightings, exactly what happened is not easy to find out[XI-17]. UFO\r\npublications in England, New Zealand, and the United States reported\r\nthat the sighting had occurred at night but, in spite of the darkness,\r\nthe witness had observed the objects in detail. She described three\r\ngray-colored, circular flying saucers; each was made up of two sections\r\nor plates, one placed on top of the other; the top plate rotated\r\ncontinuously and sent out a strong light. Moving soundlessly and in\r\nclose formation, the three saucers had performed fantastic acrobatics\r\nover the city, apparently unnoticed by the other residents. Suddenly\r\none of them had peeled off and dived low over the roof of the woman’s\r\nhouse, lighting up the whole neighborhood with the brilliant glare of\r\nits rotating section; then, going into a high-speed climb, it dropped\r\nat her feet a liquid substance that fell “like silver rain.”\r\n\r\nAccording to the more generally accepted and more probable version, the\r\nincident occurred in the morning in full daylight. The housewife was\r\nfeeding her poultry when she heard a noise on the ground near her feet.\r\nStooping down, she observed a pool of shiny liquid, like silver rain,\r\nwhich solidified within a few seconds. Looking up, she saw three large\r\nobjects moving rapidly high in the sky and they looked to her like\r\nflying saucers.\r\n\r\nA reporter on the Campinas _Correio Popular_, hearing rumors that a\r\nflying saucer had dropped strange material “something like lead,”\r\ninterviewed the woman, collected some fragments that a neighbor had\r\npicked up, and took them to a local chemist for analysis. The newspaper\r\nthen reported that the stuff was absolutely pure tin--that is, it was\r\nabout 90 per cent pure tin and the rest was either oxidation or metal\r\nalloys that were unknown on earth[XI-17, XI-18, XI-19].\r\n\r\nUnderstandably interested in this report, members of the Brazilian Air\r\nForce also interviewed the witness and collected some of the fragments\r\nshe showed them, as well as other fragments that had fallen about the\r\nsame time in other parts of the city. Laboratory analysis showed the\r\nmaterial to be merely solder. Several large airports not far from\r\nCampinas might well have had large planes in the air; they could have\r\ndropped the solder. The Air Force obviously saw no need to invoke the\r\npresence of extraterrestrial vehicles to account for the incident and\r\nconsidered the problem solved, but Brazilian saucer enthusiasts refused\r\nto accept this explanation. In their opinion the Air Force had either\r\ngotten hold of the wrong material or was covering up the true facts.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in the autumn of 1956, the reporter who had ordered\r\nthe original analysis received another collection of fragments and\r\nturned them over to a group of civilian investigators of UFO phenomena.\r\nAlthough he did not know the full history of the new fragments\r\n(unfortunately he had forgotten the names of the persons who gave them\r\nto him), he himself was convinced that they were part of the original\r\nshower of silver rain. Accepting this theory, the civilians sent the\r\nfragments to the United States for analysis: one part to a sympathetic\r\nscientist at an Ohio college, who asked a chemist colleague to test the\r\nmaterial, and another to a commercial chemist in New York. When the\r\nNew York chemist, like the Brazilian Air Force in 1954, reported that\r\nthe material was an ordinary tin solder, the UFO group concluded that\r\nthe fragment sent him must have been spurious, and refused to accept\r\nhis findings. The Ohio chemist reported that his specimen contained\r\ntin, did not contain antimony, and had a density of 10.3. Since the\r\ndensity of tin is 7.3, the sample obviously contained other elements in\r\naddition to tin.\r\n\r\nWith the reports in hand, the editor of the Brazilian _UFO Critical\r\nBulletin_ published the xenochemical conclusion under the headline,\r\n“Stuff Analyzed by American and Brazilian Scientists Proves the UFOs\r\nAre Non-Terrestrial Flying Machines.”[XI-18]\r\n\r\nThe full facts on which this conclusion rests should presumably be\r\navailable for study, but they have never been published. The origin of\r\nthe 1956 fragments is unknown; they may or may not have been part of\r\nthe 1954 fall. But the 1954 incident at least offered an apparently\r\nideal chance to establish beyond doubt the exact composition of a\r\nsubstance that fell from some object in the sky, and to determine\r\nwhether it came from earth or from beyond. The material did not\r\ndeliquesce or disappear, as gossamer and industrial waste may do,\r\nbut remained available for analysis. Incredibly, this ideal chance\r\nwas lost. Of the several chemists involved, none made a complete\r\nqualitative, quantitative, and spectroscopic analysis, and none\r\npublished his complete data. The Ohio chemist, busy with ordinary\r\nduties, had time to make only a preliminary analysis of the 1956\r\nfragment. He did not determine the amount of tin present and did not\r\ndetermine what elements other than tin were in the sample. The density\r\nof the 1954 sample is not known and the results of the complete\r\nqualitative, quantitative, and spectrographic tests, if performed, are\r\nnot available.\r\n\r\nWhen a businessman sends a specimen to a commercial chemist for\r\nanalysis, he expects to receive a specific list of exactly what\r\nelements it contains and in what percentages. If he received, instead,\r\nresults such as those of the silver-rain analysis, plus the chemist’s\r\nopinion that the specimen used to consist of something else in\r\ndifferent proportions, the businessman would very properly refuse to\r\npay.\r\n\r\nNo competent chemist would use the meager data available to assert\r\nthat the 1954 and 1956 fragments had an identical origin, or that they\r\nwere originally composed only of pure tin. A quantitative analysis\r\ntheoretically could show that a given sample is composed entirely of\r\na certain element such as tin, but if the sample contains only 90 per\r\ncent tin, 10 per cent obviously consists of other elements, and the\r\nspecimen is not 100 per cent pure tin.\r\n\r\nWith so few facts available, the actual identity of the silver rain can\r\nonly be guessed at, but overwhelming evidence indicates that it was\r\nmade right here on earth.\r\n\r\nThe _Handbook of Chemistry and Physics_ lists a large number of\r\npossibilities. At least 5 alloys of tin and lead, without antimony,\r\nhave densities between 9.43 and 10.33, like the 1956 fragments.\r\nOrdinary “plumber’s solder” is 67 per cent lead, 33 per cent tin, and\r\nhas a density of 9.4. “Tinman’s solder” is 67 per cent tin and 33 per\r\ncent lead. Many aluminum solders have neither antimony nor lead, but\r\ncontain tin in percentages ranging from 50 to 97 per cent, combined\r\nwith varying proportions of zinc, aluminum, copper, cadmium, or\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\nOne judicial-minded investigator of flying saucers gently pointed\r\nout to the editor of the _UFO Critical Bulletin_ that the use of the\r\nword “proved” for the extraterrestrial origin of the silver rain was\r\npremature, and suggested the need for obtaining and publishing a\r\ncomplete analysis before drawing any conclusions. The editor responded\r\nwith the peculiar logic of the xenochemist:\r\n\r\n“What more is necessary to convince so severe and thickheaded person\r\nas Dr. ----? Would be necessary a statement in conjunction with some\r\nhighly worldly considered scientist? ... Would be necessary a statement\r\nin conjunction from Eisenhower, Khrushchev and the Pope?--This he’ll\r\nnever get of course. Would be necessary a UFO landing on his private\r\ngarden?”[XI-17]\r\n\r\nAnother type of colored substance is the “blue rain” that sprinkled\r\na thirty-mile stretch of countryside near London on September 9,\r\n1962. Falling without warning from clear skies, it left a blue stain\r\nthat wouldn’t wash off. Investigation showed that the substance came\r\nfrom jet planes taking part in Britain’s annual giant air show at\r\nFarnborough. The jets were using the blue dye to color their vapor\r\ntrails and make a more spectacular display.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Mysterious Fragments_\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1960 Mrs. Coral Lorenzen, director of the Aerial\r\nPhenomena Research Organization, publicly challenged the truth of\r\nthe Air Force statement that “no physical or material evidence, not\r\neven a minute fragment of so-called ‘flying saucer’ has ever been\r\nfound.”[XI-20] Mrs. Lorenzen announced that she had in her possession\r\ntwo fragments of an extraterrestrial vehicle that had met with disaster\r\nin the earth’s atmosphere. Without specifying the date and location\r\nof the event, the identity of the witnesses, or any corroborative\r\ndetails of the alleged disaster, she merely said that several persons\r\nhad witnessed the catastrophe. She went on to assert, somewhat\r\nastonishingly, that “the gratifying aspect of this case, however,\r\nis that we do not have to depend on the testimony of witnesses to\r\nestablish the reality of the incident for the most advanced laboratory\r\ntests indicate that the residual material could not have been produced\r\nthrough the application of any known terrestrial techniques.”[XI-21]\r\n\r\nSending a letter and two photographs of the fragments to Colonel\r\nLawrence J. Tacker, then in the Office of Information, United States\r\nAir Force, she simultaneously released to the press copies of both\r\nletter and photographs, and suggested that the Air Force could\r\n“vindicate” itself by analyzing the material. The newspaper photographs\r\nshowed one fragment about four inches long and two inches wide\r\nresembling petrified wood in appearance, and a smaller piece shaped\r\nroughly like a flattened cupcake, whose surface showed pits and whorls\r\nlike those on the trailing end of a meteorite.\r\n\r\nTwo days later, without waiting for a reply from Washington, Mrs.\r\nLorenzen through the newspaper amplified her challenge. If the Air\r\nForce wanted to examine the mysterious fragments, she said, they would\r\nfirst have to agree to certain conditions[XI-22]:\r\n\r\n“(1) APRO officers, together with duly appointed Air Force liaison\r\npersonnel, would establish a board of experts representing both\r\nmilitary and civilian UFO researchers.\r\n\r\n“(2) This board of experts would decide what meaningful tests need to\r\nbe performed on the material in question.\r\n\r\n“(3) The board then would select a qualified testing agency to perform\r\nthese tests under its cognizance.”\r\n\r\nIn all its history, the United States Air Force can surely have\r\nreceived no more extraordinary proposition. Whatever he may have felt,\r\nColonel Tacker merely suggested that Mrs. Lorenzen could submit the\r\nmaterial to ATIC for analysis.\r\n\r\nThe fragments were never forwarded to the Air Force.\r\n\r\nEventually APRO published some information about the “disaster.” Early\r\nin September 1957 a group of fishermen on a beach near Ubataba, Brazil,\r\nhad supposedly sighted a disk-shaped object flashing down toward the\r\nsea. The UFO had suddenly veered upward and exploded, showering down\r\nfragments and sparks like fireworks. Several pieces had been obtained\r\nby a Brazilian representative of APRO, who submitted them to a chemist\r\nfor complete tests including spectrographic and X-ray diffraction\r\nanalyses.\r\n\r\nThe analyses have apparently never been published. Although they\r\nevidently showed the presence of at least three elements common on\r\nearth--magnesium, hydrogen, and oxygen--APRO somehow deduced that the\r\nfragments in their original state had consisted of pure magnesium and\r\nthat the hydroxide must have formed when they came in contact with the\r\nwater. The final conclusion stated that the object consisted, at least\r\nin part, of 100% magnesium. Similarly, perhaps, a cook might assert\r\nthat since chocolate fudge consists, at least in part, of 100 per cent\r\nsucrose, fudge must originally have been composed entirely of pure\r\nsugar, except for a little chocolate and milk it picked up in passing\r\nthrough the kitchen.\r\n\r\nFrom the few facts available a positive identification of the fragments\r\nis impossible. The description of the object seen by the fishermen fits\r\nthat of a meteor that broke into pieces near the end of its flight.\r\nIn the photographs the fragments look like ordinary meteorites, which\r\noften contain a fair amount of magnesium (see _Chapter_ V). There is\r\nno evidence to suggest that the fishermen’s “wrecked spaceship” was\r\nanything but an exploding meteor.\r\n\r\nIn the last fifteen years the Air Force has patiently analyzed dozens\r\nof odd substances ranging from angel hair to pancakes. The statement\r\nmade in 1960 by General Thomas D. White, Chief of Staff, United States\r\nAir Force, still holds true:\r\n\r\n“By an act of Congress the United States Air Force is charged with the\r\nAir Defense of the United States. Rapid identification of anything\r\nthat flies is an important part of air defense. Thus the Air Force\r\ninitiated and continues the unidentified flying object program. Under\r\nthis program all unidentified flying object sightings are investigated\r\nin meticulous detail by Air Force personnel and qualified scientific\r\nconsultants. So far, not a single bit of material evidence of the\r\nexistence of spaceships has been found.”[XI-23]\r\n\r\n[XI-1] Ormond, R. “I Found a Little Green Man,” _Flying Saucers_\r\n(August 1957).\r\n\r\n[XI-2] Scully, F. _Behind the Flying Saucers._ New York: Popular\r\nLibrary, 1951.\r\n\r\n[XI-3] Cahn, J.

Each\r\nof these atypical UFOs forms a class of its own and, when explained,\r\nproves to be the “special effect” of a unique situation. Many are\r\nmisidentified lights or reflections, but since each one derives from a\r\npeculiar combination of circumstances that may not have occurred before\r\nand is not likely to occur again, accounting for them often requires a\r\ncertain amount of luck as well as patient detective work.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, for example, that an Iowa farmer telephones the county\r\nsheriff one Tuesday afternoon to report that he has just seen a tiger\r\nrunning through his cornfield. When the sheriff arrives an hour\r\nlater and can find no trace of a tiger, he is baffled; he knows the\r\nfarmer is neither demented nor a hoaxer, and must have seen something\r\nremarkable--but what? The mystery remains unsolved until the sheriff\r\nlearns from a feature story in Sunday’s paper that on the preceding\r\nTuesday afternoon a trailer truck, carrying a shipment of animals for\r\nthe Des Moines zoo, had a flat tire while traveling on Highway X near\r\nthe junction with Route Y. During the stop to repair the tire, a giant\r\neland had escaped from its cage in the trailer; it had been recaptured\r\nand the truck had then continued its journey and delivered its cargo\r\nintact.\r\n\r\nThe sheriff can now reconstruct the peculiar combination of events that\r\nproduced the “tiger” theory. He knows that the section of Highway X\r\nwhere the truck stopped runs parallel to the far side of the farmer’s\r\ncornfield. The newspaper account tells him that a giant eland is a\r\nlarge antelope with short, twisted horns and a tawny-colored coat with\r\ndark stripes. He concludes that the farmer, having only a few seconds’\r\nglimpse of a strange animal among the corn, had observed the eland’s\r\nstripes but had failed to notice its horns, and had therefore mistaken\r\nit for a tiger.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Role of Unusual Coincidence_\r\n\r\nAnalogous unlikely coincidences account for many flying-saucer reports.\r\nThe factors that encourage the misinterpretation may be the particular\r\ntime or place at which the phenomenon appears, the kind of weather, the\r\nexperience, physical state, or mood of the observer, his unawareness\r\nof a certain fact, or any combination of these and other relevant\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nA fairly simple case of this type was the reported landing of a\r\nspacecraft near an Army barracks (often referred to in saucer\r\npublications as the “Nike site”) in a rural area of Maryland, shortly\r\nbefore dawn on the morning of September 29, 1958. The sergeant on duty\r\nthat morning left the orderly room at 4:25 A.M. and started to the\r\nbarracks to waken the troops. The sky was clear, with bright moonlight.\r\nHearing a whirring sound like a pitched baseball with a loose cover, he\r\nlooked up toward the west to see a brilliant round white object soaring\r\nthrough the sky from north to south, and breaking up into smaller\r\npieces as it traveled. It disappeared behind the roof of the mess hall,\r\ndirectly to the west, after being in view about two seconds. Hurrying\r\naround the south side of the mess hall to search the western horizon,\r\nhe observed a very bright white, pulsating light at ground level,\r\napparently in a wooded area some four or five miles west of the battery\r\nsite, as though the glowing object had landed there. He reported the\r\nincident to an officer, who measured the azimuth position of the\r\nunknown. The glow remained in one place but diminished with increasing\r\ndaylight until it was no longer visible.\r\n\r\nAir Force investigators arrived that afternoon. They had already\r\nreceived many reports that a brilliant fireball had flashed through\r\nthe sky at 4:25 A.M., the time in question, and had been observed by\r\nmany witnesses in the area between Washington, D.C., and Pittsburgh,\r\nPennsylvania, but no fireball could account for the ground light.\r\nThe next morning at 5:15 A.M. an intensely white, fluctuating light\r\nwas observed at the same place and was studied through binoculars\r\nuntil daylight made it invisible; it could be seen only from the west\r\nside of the mess hall, and one step to the right or left would hide\r\nit from the observer. Traveling toward the position of the unknown,\r\ninvestigators found a dairy barn three miles away, and on a direct line\r\nof sight from the place the UFO had been observed. On one end of the\r\nbarn was a 200-watt floodlight with a white reflector, still burning.\r\nOn questioning the farmer, they learned that until recently the light\r\nhad been burned out and had not been in use. The early hour of sunrise\r\nduring the summer had provided all the light he needed to milk his\r\ncows. With the shorter days of autumn, however, he had needed the light\r\nand had replaced the bulb only a few days before. On the morning of the\r\nsighting, he had turned on the light a few minutes before the sergeant\r\nhad noticed it[XII-1].\r\n\r\nThus several unrelated factors had combined to produce the illusion\r\nof a landed space vehicle: 1) only a week earlier, newspapers had\r\npublicized the alleged landing of a flying saucer in Sheffield Lake,\r\nOhio (see _Chapter_ XIII); 2) a brilliant fireball had appeared; 3) a\r\nfarmer had turned on a floodlight, previously out of use for several\r\nmonths; 4) the meteor had disappeared and the floodlight had appeared\r\nin roughly the same position as viewed by the observer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Problem of Unknown Lights_\r\n\r\nAt night, when an observer notices a light appearing out of the\r\ndarkness, he usually cannot see the object that produces or carries the\r\nlight. Under familiar conditions on the ground or in the air he usually\r\ninterprets the light correctly, by a kind of informed guesswork, as\r\nthat of an automobile, an advertising sign, an airport beacon, a\r\nplane, a star, etc. But if it appears under unfamiliar conditions or\r\nin unexpected circumstances, he has to make an uninformed guess based\r\non largely unconscious estimates of its size, distance, height, color,\r\nand rate of movement. To the driver of a car on a dark country road,\r\na single light suddenly appearing ahead may indicate a plane or a\r\nstar low in the sky or something on the road itself--a motorcycle, a\r\ncar with only one headlight working, a workman’s lantern, a pedestrian\r\ncarrying a flashlight, or something else. A double light may mean\r\nanother automobile, two motorcycles traveling parallel, an animal whose\r\neyes shine in the approaching headlight, or something else. The driver\r\ncannot be sure he interprets the light correctly until he passes it and\r\ncan see the object itself or until he can identify it in some other way.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Michigan’s Flying Bird Cage_\r\n\r\nA UFO sighting based on mistaken identification of strange lights\r\noccurred in the early morning hours of March 22, 1959, near Ann Arbor,\r\nMichigan. The night was clear, the moon was nearly full, and visibility\r\nwas unusually good. At about 1:30 A.M. a man and his wife driving on\r\na country road suddenly noticed a strange object hovering in the sky\r\nsouth of the road. According to their report to the Air Force, the UFO\r\nwas an elongated oval with a dome on top, something like a bird cage,\r\nand brilliantly illuminated by two shafts of intense pale-yellow light\r\nthat sprang from the bottom and converged over the top. Frightened at\r\nthis apparition, the witnesses could provide only uncertain estimates\r\nof distance and size. The object seemed to be twenty to thirty feet in\r\ndiameter, was at an altitude of about 200 feet when first seen, and\r\nwas hovering about two miles away. As they drove on, the object seemed\r\nto move and travel parallel with the car for about a mile. Then the\r\nyellow lights dimmed and a circle of eight or ten red lights suddenly\r\nappeared on the underside, the UFO rose vertically, very rapidly, and\r\nvanished in a few seconds. It had been in view for a period of five to\r\nten minutes.\r\n\r\nChecking the most probable explanations first, ATIC officials found\r\nthat the nearby Willow Run Airport had had no aircraft in the vicinity\r\nat the time and that no star or planet seemed to be involved. Further\r\ninvestigation showed that the flying bird cage was actually the radio\r\ntelescope of the University of Michigan. The telescope was installed\r\non the top of Peach Mountain and was clearly visible from the road\r\non which the witnesses were traveling. On the underside of the\r\neighty-five-foot “dish” was a wire-mesh structure that suggested the\r\nbird cage. At the time of the sighting the dish was facing in the\r\ndirection of the witnesses and was illuminated by a floodlight as\r\nwell as by the bright moonlight. It had seemed to be following the\r\ncar only because the car itself was moving. The astronomers operating\r\nthe telescope were rotating the dish from the horizon to the zenith,\r\nand the yellow lights dimmed because the witnesses were seeing less\r\nand less of the surface. The “circle” of red lights was the red\r\naircraft-warning lights on the WUOM radio tower, which lay in a direct\r\nline between the telescope and the witnesses. When the dish reached the\r\nzenith and was pointed to the sky overhead, the operating crew turned\r\noff the floodlights. The dish was no longer visible to the witnesses,\r\nwho interpreted the sudden disappearance as a sudden vertical ascent\r\ninto the sky[XII-1].\r\n\r\n\r\n_UFOs from Reflections_\r\n\r\nReflections from the bright sun have produced many elusive UFOs. All\r\npilots are familiar with the luminous objects that sometimes appear in\r\nthe air below a plane on a sunny day, particularly when the plane is\r\nflying over wooded terrain that is partly obscured by atmospheric haze.\r\nThe sun has been reflected momentarily from a broad shiny surface, such\r\nas the metal roof of a farm building; because of the contrast between\r\nthe bright surface and the dark forest surrounding it, the image\r\nappears to be a UFO floating high in the air.\r\n\r\nSometimes the sun shines on a bright metallic surface, such as the\r\nchrome trim of an automobile, and by chance is reflected directly into\r\nthe eyes of a passer-by. If he then glances at the sky he may see a\r\nwhole fleet of UFOs; the bright flash has produced a temporary chemical\r\nchange in the retina so that for a moment or two the eye sees a series\r\nof saucer-shaped images of the sun. A photographer’s flashbulb or a\r\nbright flash of lightning can produce similar after-images.\r\n\r\nSome startling UFOs have been produced by reflections from an object\r\nthat the witness was not able to see or did not recognize. One night\r\nin the spring of 1961 an amateur astronomer reported that a huge\r\ncigar-shaped flying saucer was hovering in the sky several thousand\r\nfeet above the Harvard College Observatory. Investigation showed that\r\nthe “UFO” was a reflection from a small oblong insulator on an electric\r\nwire strung between two buildings. Faintly illuminated from below\r\nby the lights from the unshaded windows, it seemed to be an immense\r\nand brilliantly glowing object high in the sky. The witness at first\r\nrefused to believe that he could so mistake the evidence of his own\r\neyes. Next morning, however, he returned to the scene and was able to\r\nsee that what had appeared the night before to be a giant spaceship was\r\nonly a small insulator a few feet above his head.\r\n\r\nThe bright sun reflected at a particular time from an object invisible\r\nto the observer often produces a puzzling phenomenon, such as the\r\nflying saucer reported from Danby, California, early in October 1958.\r\n\r\nAbout 4:00 in the afternoon on October 2, three prospectors standing\r\nnear a tungsten mill at Railroad Danby noticed a sudden bright glow in\r\nthe northwest sky which remained visible for about 2½ hours and then\r\ndisappeared. When a glow appeared again the following day at the same\r\ntime and place, the observers tried to identify it by using a small\r\ntelescope and saw a bright, oblong object hovering above the horizon;\r\nit was the color of aluminum, approximately fifteen feet long, five\r\nfeet high, and about four miles away. Getting into a car, the men drove\r\nin the direction of the object and searched the supposed location on\r\nfoot for several hours, but could find no trace of the UFO.\r\n\r\nSeveral days later, realizing that the object reappeared every day at\r\nabout the same time and place, two of the men decided to investigate\r\nfurther. Studying the object through a pair of powerful binoculars,\r\nthey could see guy wires coming from it and rods radiating from the guy\r\nwires. Remembering that two tall radio antennas used by the highway\r\npatrol stood in approximately the same location, the witnesses found\r\nthe explanation, which Air Force investigators confirmed. The antennas,\r\nplaced some twenty feet apart, extended about twenty feet above the\r\ntrees. The cigar-shaped hovering object was a special effect depending\r\non a particular combination of circumstances: only during the first\r\npart of October, and only late in the afternoon, did the sun’s rays\r\nstrike the antenna in such a way that the reflection was visible to an\r\nobserver at Railroad Danby[XII-1].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sundogs in Utah and France_\r\n\r\nSundogs are another special effect resulting from a peculiar\r\ncombination of circumstances, and they continue to supply their quota\r\nof good UFO reports. Tiny ice crystals floating in a layer of quiet\r\nair and reflecting a bright sun are responsible for producing sundogs.\r\nA thin layer of such crystals may be invisible to the observer; a\r\nthick layer appears as the familiar cirrus clouds. Sunlight filtering\r\nthrough such an ice fog is reflected in each crystal so that a pattern\r\nof bright spots of light forms in the sky, an image of the sun that\r\nsometimes rivals the sun itself in brilliance. These images are called\r\nmock suns, sundogs, or parhelia when they accompany the sun (and mock\r\nmoons, moondogs, or paraselenae when they accompany the moon). They\r\nappear in the sky at a position a given distance from the sun and\r\nusually have a trace of red on the edge nearest the sun.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a sundog makes a complete circle of light surrounding\r\nthe sun with four bright patches, one above, one below, and one on\r\neither side. Sometimes two circles will appear, one within the other,\r\nsurmounted by an inverted arc and traversed by a cross, like the\r\nspokes of a wheel whose center is the sun. The complicated structure\r\nof a fully developed mock sun--which is extremely rare--can suggest\r\nto the imaginative an enormous chariot in the sky and can terrify the\r\nsuperstitious. There is little doubt that this phenomenon inspired the\r\ntwo visions of Ezekiel described in the Bible.\r\n\r\nMock suns have been the cause of many UFO sightings. Even after several\r\npublications [see [XII-1a]] explained how the sun reflected from ice\r\ncrystals could account for some of the reported flying saucers, this\r\nidea was largely ignored by early investigators who had a limited\r\ntraining in the physical sciences.\r\n\r\nSundogs are relatively uncommon. Few airmen, even those with long\r\nexperience, have learned to recognize them. In a poll of both\r\ncommercial and military pilots, Dr. Menzel found that only one in\r\nfive knew what a sundog was and how it might look in the sky. Two of\r\nthree generals in the Air Force, similarly, were unfamiliar with the\r\nphenomenon. Like balloons, sundogs have a silvery metallic sheen. When\r\nobserved from the ground, they seem to hover or move very sluggishly;\r\nto a witness in the air they seem to move rapidly, to pace the plane,\r\nor to take evasive action as though under intelligent control. When\r\nenough data are available, and the time of day and the position of\r\nthe unknown relative to the sun are appropriate, a mock sun should be\r\nconsidered as a possible explanation of the UFO.\r\n\r\nA sundog seen from a plane can suggest a spectacular and fantastic\r\nstructure, like the one reported over Rheims, France, at 2:30 P.M.\r\nlocal time on March 31, 1960. The pilot and crew of a C-47 plane\r\ndescribed the unknown as like a gigantic spool of thread some twelve\r\nfeet tall. The neck of the spool, about six feet in diameter, seemed to\r\nbe capped at top and bottom by disks eight or ten feet in diameter. The\r\nupper disk was reddish, the lower, blue-green. The plane was flying at\r\n6000 feet and had just passed from a storm area into a region of calm\r\nwith unlimited visibility. The UFO remained in view for about sixty\r\nseconds, then suddenly vanished. From an analysis of the data, the\r\nposition of the unknown relative to the sun and the observers, and the\r\nweather situation, Air Force investigators positively identified the\r\nobject as a mock sun[XII-1].\r\n\r\nOne of the most recent sightings of this type occurred on October 2,\r\n1961, a few minutes after noon[XII-1]. A civilian pilot who was just\r\ntaking off from the Utah Central Airport at Salt Lake City noticed a\r\nbright silvery disk in the air ahead of his plane. He supposed it to\r\nbe another aircraft crossing his course. When he was air-borne, he\r\nwas surprised to find that the object, now an elongated pencil shape,\r\nstill appeared in the same position where he had first seen it and\r\nhence could not be a plane. Puzzled, he radioed the control tower and\r\nreported the UFO. Looking south as directed by the pilot, the tower\r\noperator easily found the object, a bright spot in the sky directly\r\nbelow the sun and apparently hovering over the town of Provo, forty\r\nmiles to the south.\r\n\r\nDeciding to investigate, the pilot left the traffic pattern and started\r\ndirectly south after the UFO. It seemed to be standing practically\r\nstill in the sky, with a little rocking motion, at an altitude of\r\n6500 to 7000 feet. He seemed to have approached within three to five\r\nmiles when the UFO suddenly shot up “like an elevator” and retreated\r\nrapidly south, as though taking evasive action. The acceleration was\r\ntremendous, almost as though the UFO had been fired from a rocket, but\r\nthere was no vapor trail and no sound. It then disappeared, gradually.\r\n“It just faded out. I kept my eyes glued right on it because I could\r\nsee it was moving away at a great speed. I wanted to see how long\r\nit would take and it was just a second or two until it had faded\r\ncompletely. And it was getting smaller all the time, you could see it\r\nwas moving away.” The speed of departure, the pilot estimated, must\r\nhave been thousands of miles an hour.\r\n\r\nAlerted by the pilot’s message to the control tower, several persons on\r\nthe ground at the Salt Lake City airport, most of them with experience\r\nas pilots, had also been watching the UFO. Ground observers at the\r\nProvo airport, also alerted, were not able to locate the unknown, even\r\nthough they had been told it was almost directly overhead.\r\n\r\nInvestigators from a nearby Air Force Base interviewed the witnesses,\r\nwho were obviously competent and reliable. All agreed that the\r\nunknown had been a bright, silvery, metallic-looking object that\r\nseemed to glisten or flicker in the sun; that it was roughly oval or\r\nindeterminate in shape; that it was solid and tangible, but not a\r\nconventional aircraft or balloon; that it made no sound, showed no\r\nexhaust or vapor trail; that it was in view roughly fifteen minutes,\r\nand disappeared gradually by “blotting out” or fading. All but one\r\nof the witnesses agreed that the skies had been absolutely clear and\r\ncloudless; one stated that, although the day was clear, a very slight\r\nhaze existed over the mountainous region where the UFO appeared.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this general agreement, certain significant discrepancies\r\nbecame evident. The pursuing pilot stated that the object had moved up\r\nand away from him at incredible speed, as though it were controlled.\r\nThe ground observers, however, did not see any movement by the UFO.\r\nMost of them reported that it remained stationary as though it were\r\nsuspended in the air; a few said that it vanished at intervals, only to\r\nreappear a few seconds later in another place. Most of the time, they\r\nagreed, it just hung in the sky until it faded from view.\r\n\r\nBy analysis of these clues, ATIC was able to solve the mystery.\r\nAccording to the local weather bureau, the sky had been clear with\r\nvisibility unlimited, but there had been very thin cirrus clouds, a\r\nlayer of minute ice crystals suitable for producing a mock sun. A\r\nsundog would also account for the contradictory statements about the\r\nUFO’s motion. Since the ground observers remained in one place, their\r\nposition relative to the sundog did not change and it seemed to remain\r\nstationary. The pilot, however, was in a moving plane and changing his\r\nposition relative to the UFO; hence it seemed to move rapidly away\r\nfrom him. In the same way a rainbow seems stationary to a person who\r\nmerely stands and watches it. But if he begins to chase it, hoping to\r\ncatch up and perhaps find the legendary pot of gold, the rainbow seems\r\nto move away and elude its pursuer. The pilot’s belief that the UFO\r\nhad exhibited fantastic speed was, according to his own statement,\r\nan inference based on the fact that the UFO quickly dwindled, became\r\nvery small, and vanished. It disappeared, however, not because it was\r\nspeeding away at thousands of miles an hour, but because of a change in\r\nthe relative positions of sun and ice clouds that produced the sundog\r\nin the first place. One final point nailed down this explanation. The\r\nangular distance between sun and UFO was exactly that to be expected\r\nbetween sun and mock sun, at that time and place.\r\n\r\nThe details of this sighting obviously show a striking resemblance to\r\nsome of those in the Mantell case (p. 33), in which the UFO and the sun\r\nhad the same bearing from the pursuing plane as in the Salt Lake City\r\nincident. With the information now available, there can be little doubt\r\nthat Mantell was actually chasing a Skyhook balloon. But in 1948 when\r\nso many of the relevant facts were not known, the sundog theory was a\r\nreasonable solution and may still be the correct one.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bright Spots on Films_\r\n\r\nA bright blur, a ring of light, or a circular image something like the\r\ntypical disk-shaped flying saucer sometimes appears on a film, much to\r\nthe surprise of the photographer, who had not noticed any such object\r\nwhen he took the picture. These UFOs are usually caused by reflections\r\nfrom unnoticed drops of moisture in the air or by defects in the\r\ncamera itself (see Figure 17). If the source of the image is something\r\npeculiar, it may pose a real problem (see Plates VIIIa and b).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 17._ Distorted images produced on film by lens\r\ndefects. A, True image; B, image produced by poor lens, not well\r\nfigured; C, by astigmatism; D, coma; E, off-axis beam; F, off-axis beam\r\nand coma.]\r\n\r\nOn July 24, 1957, an American tourist in Norway snapped a picture of a\r\ngroup of houses on a cliff above the seacoast, and was amazed to find\r\nsome time later that the print showed a large white, doughnut-shaped\r\nobject hovering in the sky above the coast. Puzzled by this apparent\r\nevidence of a saucer that had been visible to the camera but not to\r\nher, she submitted the facts to ATIC investigators. Thorough study\r\nof the negative, the camera, possible sources of reflection in the\r\nlandscape at the time the photograph was taken, all failed to account\r\nfor the mysterious intruder. Obviously not a cloud, the image closely\r\nresembled a smoke ring, but the photographer had not been smoking\r\nand there were no sources of smoke in the neighborhood. The experts\r\nwere baffled until one of them thought of a new possibility and again\r\nquestioned the witness: had she by any chance been wearing a ring when\r\nshe took the picture? She had--a sparkling diamond. If the angle of\r\nthe sun, the direction she was facing, and the position of her ring\r\nfinger in relation to the camera lens and to the sun had been exactly\r\nright, the annular image would have been reflected into the lens at the\r\ninstant she snapped the picture. The resulting bright ring would look\r\nexactly like the UFO that appeared on the negative[XII-1] (see Plate\r\nVIIb).\r\n\r\nAn unusually fine large UFO inserted itself into a photograph taken on\r\nFebruary 6, 1959, near Boulder, Colorado. The witness had spent the\r\nafternoon climbing on Flagstaff Mountain and, about 5:00 P.M., snapped\r\na picture of the town of Boulder, to the southeast. Although he had\r\nseen nothing unusual in the sky or in the air, the negative, when\r\ndeveloped, showed a small black blob that printed as a white, luminous,\r\nroughly spherical object--a typical flying saucer (see Plate VIIa).\r\n\r\nCivilian saucer investigators in the area procured a copy of the\r\nphotograph and sent it to NICAP for evaluation. The witness himself\r\ndid not immediately assume that he had photographed an interplanetary\r\nspaceship hovering over the city of Boulder; instead, he sent a print\r\nand a description of the circumstances to Dr. Menzel, who was well\r\nacquainted with the geography of Boulder and Flagstaff Mountain. Dr.\r\nMenzel suggested that the blob of light could have been produced by\r\nsome type of reflection: “The sun appears to have been pretty low at\r\nthe time. Is there, in the approximate position of the blob, some house\r\nwith a fairly large window that could have been reflecting the sun?\r\nStand at approximately the same spot and look over the region with a\r\nfield glass. A bright spot like this often spreads enormously on the\r\nfilm. You can see from the picture that the sun must have been shining\r\nbrilliantly. The shadow, especially of the large barn on the right,\r\ngives us some idea of the height of the sun. This was in February, and\r\nthe angle of the sun will now have changed. Please make this test and\r\nlet me know.”\r\n\r\nNot until the first week of May, however, was the witness able to\r\nrepeat his excursion and make the necessary tests. Using a copy of his\r\noriginal picture as a guide, he was able to stand in the exact spot\r\nfrom which he had taken the picture. He then realized that the Law\r\nBuilding of the University of Colorado stood in the place occupied by\r\nthe UFO and that the big double window of the Law Building was at the\r\nexact center. In May no reflection appeared, but from calculations he\r\nfound that the position of the February sun was such that the window,\r\nwhen open at just the right tilt, would reflect the sun’s image to the\r\nexact spot on Flagstaff Mountain from which he took the picture. The\r\nimage of the reflected sun is extremely bright and the film had been\r\noverexposed: therefore the image had spread on the film to create the\r\nlarge UFO. To confirm the hypothesis, the witness tried overprinting\r\nthe negative so that the entire picture came out practically black,\r\nand with successively longer exposures the size of the bright UFO\r\ndiminished. As he got it down to the smallest size on the blackest\r\nprint, he could see the fuzzy outline of a window[XII-2].\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unfamiliar Lights on Planes_\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1961, a leading saucer publication stated that\r\nunidentified objects were still surveying the earth and cited, among\r\nother cases, a bright UFO seen maneuvering the night of March 23\r\nnear Fort Pierce, Florida[XII-3]. The report failed to mention that\r\nunidentified lights were seen on several other nights during that week\r\nin the skies over Jacksonville, Miami, and Cocoa-Titusville, as well\r\nas over Fort Pierce. Newspaper offices and radio stations in the area\r\nreceived many telephone queries about the mysterious lights, which were\r\nobserved from the ground and from the air for periods of time ranging\r\nfrom five minutes to an hour. The descriptions showed an impressive\r\nconsistency: the UFO was a round, twinkling light with a red or orange\r\ncolor changing to white, and exhibited a bobbing up-and-down motion as\r\nit swept across the horizon. In all sightings the weather was clear and\r\nthe visibility excellent.\r\n\r\nOn the night of March 24 an Eastern Airlines pilot reported the UFO\r\nto the Miami Traffic Control. An observer in the control tower at the\r\nairport could see the object, but lost sight of it when he took up a\r\nplane to chase it. On the following night the Cocoa-Titusville Airport\r\nreported a similar object. A pilot in the air sighted the unknown and,\r\nabout an hour later, encountered a turbulence unlike anything he had\r\nexperienced in sixteen years of flying. Cruising in the region the next\r\nday, he observed a burned-out area on the ground below the place where\r\nthe UFO had been. On the night of March 27, a ground observer watched\r\nthe unknown through binoculars as it moved rapidly from west to north\r\nand gradually disappeared in the northwest.\r\n\r\nMost of these witnesses were veteran airmen, well able to recognize\r\nconventional phenomena in the night sky. Studying their reports,\r\nofficials at Patrick Air Force Base decided that the similarity of the\r\ndescriptions warranted further investigation. In the preliminary study,\r\nan Intelligence officer took up a B-57 aircraft in the vicinity of Fort\r\nPierce, while ground radar at Patrick Air Force Base kept his plane\r\nunder constant surveillance. At 7:20 P.M., when at 25,000 feet, he saw\r\nthe UFO, a white light three times brighter than the brightest star.\r\nIt appeared in the western sky and was moving north to south. When\r\nviewed with the naked eye, the light looked like a star that dimmed and\r\nbrightened in a regular cycle; through binoculars it also displayed\r\nthe red and green navigation lights of a plane. Soon after the visual\r\nsighting, the ground radar informed the investigating pilot that the\r\nobject was approximately fifty nautical miles from his plane and was a\r\njet airliner bound for Miami; the jet was observed for approximately\r\nten minutes as it descended toward the Miami airport. The investigating\r\nplane remained in the air and, about five minutes after the jet had\r\nlanded, observed a second, similar, high-intensity light that appeared\r\nin the western sky, moving from north to south. The radar at the Miami\r\nair-traffic control center positively identified this light as a Delta\r\nAirline jet, Flight 833, proceeding southeast. From these facts the\r\nofficers concluded that the UFOs seen in Florida that week had been\r\nproduced by commercial jet airliners[XII-1].\r\n\r\nTwo questions remained: How had the experienced pilots and ground\r\nobservers failed to recognize so familiar a phenomenon as a\r\nnight-flying jet? What accounted for the unprecedented turbulence\r\nexperienced by one pilot, and the burned-over ground below the region\r\nof the sighting?\r\n\r\nThe first question was soon answered. ATIC investigators telephoned\r\nthe Federal Aviation Agency and learned that experiments with a new\r\ntype of anti-collision beacon were being carried out from various field\r\noffices, and that several jet airliners as well as some turboprop\r\naircraft were using the new light. The standard beacon was a rotating\r\nsodium light, whose color is yellow. The new beacon was an intense\r\nwhite light which, viewed at a slant, becomes a spectacular phenomenon\r\neven more brilliant than Venus or Jupiter seen rising or setting\r\nthrough a hazy atmosphere. Since the witnesses were not familiar with\r\nthe appearance of the experimental beacons, they had not recognized the\r\nnewly equipped jets.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the second question came later, an example of the “luck”\r\nrequired to solve some of these UFO puzzles. Major W. T. Coleman, then\r\nAir Force Information Officer for the UFO project, was flying over\r\nthe Fort Pierce region on the afternoon of April 29 in calm, clear\r\nweather when his plane ran into moderate turbulence of the short-wave\r\ntype, “like riding in a car over a washboard road.” The wind-shear\r\ncomponent was not large enough to explain the turbulence, and though\r\na cold front was approaching from the Gulf of Mexico, it was still\r\nfar out on the edge of the western horizon. Then, being a native of\r\nFlorida, he suddenly remembered that muck fires were fairly common in\r\nthe Everglades region, which lay below the plane. Peering down at the\r\nglades, he noticed a very large muck fire. He concluded:\r\n\r\n“Now, as typical with a cold front situation, the surface wind was\r\nblowing from the east pushing the smoke and heat toward the west coast\r\nof Florida. This relatively warm air naturally was lifting in the\r\nsurrounding cool air. When the continuing warm air rose rapidly to the\r\nhigher altitudes it ran into the reversed upper winds (high altitude\r\nwesterly). In the process of being lifted the smoke filtered and\r\ncleared, yet the air remained relatively heated. It was moved directly\r\nacross our course, thereby causing turbulence.”[XII-4]\r\n\r\nThe fires explained both the turbulence reported during the week of the\r\nUFO sightings and the burned-out area below the region of turbulence.\r\nThus these Florida UFOs were not spacecraft watching the earth, but\r\nwere a special effect created by the chance combination of unrelated\r\nfactors: a new and unfamiliar anti-collision beacon, an advancing cold\r\nfront, and fires in the Florida swamps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inversions in California_\r\n\r\nAn unusually complex combination of events produced an epidemic of UFO\r\nsightings in northern California during the week of August 12 to 20,\r\n1960. Nearly every night dozens of reliable citizens throughout Tehama\r\nCounty and the Mount Shasta region (long famous for its mysterious\r\nlights) reported UFOs at various times and of various descriptions:\r\nround, bright, metallic UFOs glowing with a reddish-purple fluorescent\r\ntype of light, cigar-shaped UFOs trailing a long fiery exhaust,\r\noval UFOs with red lights at each end and white lights in between,\r\nyellow-colored UFOs like a flying railroad car with flashing red lights\r\nat each end and white lights glowing at the windows. Radios roared with\r\nstatic and radar sets were plagued with phantoms, as the state was\r\napparently invaded by a whole fleet of patrolling saucers.\r\n\r\nThe most important factor in these sightings was the weather; prolonged\r\nand extensive temperature inversions prevailed in the area all that\r\nweek. From southern Oregon through northern California multiple\r\ninversions of 3 to 18 degrees occurred nightly. Under these conditions,\r\npractically any light shining into the night was apt to be projected\r\nupward as a mirage and to perform weird antics. Determining what was\r\nthe particular light source of some specific phenomenon is almost\r\nimpossible.\r\n\r\nAs complicating factors, certain heavenly bodies made their own\r\ncontribution to the excitement. Most of the objects observed late at\r\nnight and watched for periods of one to three hours were refracted\r\nimages of the stars Capella or Aldebaran or the planet Mars.\r\n\r\nSome of the most spectacular sightings were those reported from Red\r\nBluff on the night of August 13–14. Two highway patrolmen were chasing\r\na speeding motorcycle when, at about 11:50 P.M. P.D.S.T., they saw what\r\nthey at first supposed to be a brilliantly lighted aircraft falling\r\ndirectly toward them. Jumping out of their car, they watched the object\r\nas it apparently reversed its course, shot upward, and began to perform\r\nfantastic maneuvers in the eastern sky. The performance continued for\r\nmore than two hours. Before it ended, a second UFO had joined in the\r\ncelestial dance, which was observed by dozens of excited witnesses in\r\nthe Red Bluff area.\r\n\r\nAir Force bases in the neighborhood were notified, and ATIC\r\ninvestigators gathered and studied the evidence. There was no real\r\nmystery[XII-1]. The UFO first noticed by the patrolmen was probably\r\nthe star Capella, which at Red Bluff is circumpolar; it rose at 10:50\r\nP.M. and at the time of the sighting was about 4.7 degrees above the\r\nnortheast horizon. About an hour later (12:48 A.M.) Mars rose, also in\r\nthe northeast; and close behind it (1:15 A.M.) came the bright star\r\nAldebaran, which made a striking pair with Mars. With three brilliant\r\nheavenly bodies just above the horizon, on a night of fantastic\r\nmultiple inversions of temperature and humidity, the only surprising\r\nfact is that the number of UFOs reported was not larger.\r\n\r\nA person who has never been lucky enough to see a good mirage may\r\nfeel skeptical about the phenomenon. But those who have encountered a\r\nfirst-rate specimen--for example, the Chicago skyline suspended upside\r\ndown in mid-air above Lake Michigan--know how startlingly real it can\r\nseem. When the source of the mirage is not apparent, the displaced\r\nimage can seem mysterious and even frightening, as do many UFOs.\r\n\r\nOne such phenomenon, which might easily have been interpreted as a\r\nflying saucer, appeared shortly after dark one evening in mid-July,\r\n1954, and was described by Dr. Menzel in a letter to a friend:\r\n\r\n“My wife and I were driving to Alamosa, Colorado, on one of the\r\nlongest, straightest stretches of highway in the United States,\r\ncommonly referred to as the ‘gun-barrel highway.’ I had turned over\r\nthe wheel to her and was settling back for a rest, after a long turn\r\nat driving over the mountains, when I became aware of unusual driving\r\nbehavior on her part. First she would step on the gas, then on the\r\nbrake, then on the gas again. ‘What is the matter? What are you trying\r\nto do?’ I asked. ‘See that truck ahead?’ she replied. ‘Every time I try\r\nto pass it, it speeds up, and then it slows down when I try to give it\r\na chance to get ahead of me. It’s making me nervous.’\r\n\r\n“I peered ahead through the darkness and there, sure enough, about\r\nthree hundred feet ahead of us was a truck, its dark body brilliantly\r\noutlined with red and white lights. I studied the situation and glanced\r\nat the speedometer, which read forty miles per hour. ‘Well,’ I advised\r\nher, ‘you certainly ought to be able to pass that, dear, the way you\r\nusually drive.’ And this time she really stepped on the gas, pushing\r\nthe speed up to sixty, seventy, eighty, and finally eighty-five. And\r\nwould you believe it, that truck took right out ahead, still holding\r\nits estimated three hundred feet clearance, and matched us for every\r\nmile of that speed. By this time I was beginning to get an idea. ‘Slow\r\ndown,’ I said. My wife obliged me by coming to a dead stop, brakes\r\nsquealing.\r\n\r\n“‘Now see there,’ she said, ‘I just escaped running into that truck.’\r\nAnd the truck had stopped, still 300 feet ahead. At this point I\r\nventured my conclusion. ‘That isn’t a truck,’ I explained. ‘It’s a\r\nflying saucer.’ ‘You have flying saucers on the brain,’ she said. Well,\r\nto shorten the story, she started the car again and the ‘truck’ moved\r\noff. And we chased it in that fashion for about fifty miles. On rare\r\noccasions, as we dipped slightly in a hollow, the truck would seem to\r\ndash ahead at speeds close to 1000 miles an hour. Or sometimes it would\r\njump straight up, momentarily vanish, and then drop back into the road.\r\n\r\n“The explanation was quite simple. The hot day had warmed the air\r\nclose to the pavement, but the cooling of the surface at the onset of\r\ndarkness had caused a layer of warm air to be sandwiched in between the\r\ncold air close to the road surface and the cold air above. This acted\r\nlike a lens which produced an out-of-focus image of a bright tavern\r\nsign more than fifty miles away, a real mirage. There were few cars\r\non the road, but as we met them the effect was most startling because\r\nsome of them were so enlarged by the lens effect that a car five miles\r\naway seemed to be rushing directly at us only a block or two ahead.\r\nSometimes these cars would appear to come to a sharp stop, reverse\r\ntheir course and disappear in the distance. At other times they would\r\nappear to be rushing on us upside down, with part of the road itself\r\nin the sky. Altogether it was a weird experience, but not in any sense\r\nsupernatural. Lenses of air, either close to the ground or in the sky,\r\ncan produce strange illusions.”\r\n\r\nIn this case, as in many UFO puzzles, the solution depended on\r\na knowledge of the weather conditions and of the facts of local\r\ngeography. If the pursuing car had turned off the road or stopped\r\nfor the night before reaching the tavern, the specific cause of the\r\nphenomenon might still be a mystery.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Chesapeake Bay Case_\r\n\r\nTwo of the most famous UFO cases, the Nash-Fortenberry and the Tombaugh\r\nsightings, have never been completely explained even though the\r\nwitnesses were unusually competent, the incidents fully described, and\r\nthe basic facts not in dispute. Although the probable type of mechanism\r\ninvolved is clear in each case, determining specifically what factors\r\ncombined in exactly what way to produce the phenomenon has so far\r\nproved impossible. Neither case, however, supports the theory that the\r\nUFO had an extraterrestrial origin.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of July 14, 1952, a Pan-American DC-4 was flying\r\nfrom New York to Miami, carrying ten passengers and a crew of three\r\nincluding First Officer William B. Nash and Second Officer William H.\r\nFortenberry. As a pilot spending much of his life in the air, Captain\r\nNash had long been interested in the question of UFOs, and during\r\nthe long night hours of over-water flights he had often cut down\r\nthe cockpit lights to search the sky. In five years of watching he\r\nhad observed hundreds of meteors, various types of auroral display,\r\nthe lights of other aircraft, and the multicolored images of stars\r\nand planets distorted by refraction, but he had never seen any\r\nunidentifiable aerial phenomenon that appeared to be under intelligent\r\ncontrol--until this particular night, when he was not watching for UFOs.\r\n\r\nShortly after 8 P.M. E.S.T. the plane was cruising on automatic pilot\r\nat about 8000 feet over Chesapeake Bay, and approaching Norfolk,\r\nVirginia. The sun had set and the night was almost entirely dark,\r\nalthough the coast line was still visible. Fortenberry, sitting at the\r\nright as copilot, was making his first run on this particular course\r\nand Nash, in the pilot’s seat at the left, was pointing out the cities\r\nand landmarks of the route. Nash had just called attention to the\r\nlights of Newport News and Cumberland, ahead and to the right of the\r\nplane, when at 8:12 a brilliant red glow suddenly appeared in the west,\r\napparently between Newport News and the aircraft, and so low that it\r\nmight almost have been on the ground. One of the men exclaimed, as\r\nhave so many incredulous witnesses on first seeing a UFO, “What the\r\nhell is that?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 18._ Reported movements of the Chesapeake Bay\r\ndisks. A, Disks at first approach; B, they flip over and reverse order;\r\nC, they change direction and recede.]\r\n\r\nLooking through the front windows of the cockpit, they watched the\r\nunidentified light traveling northeast at incredible speed on a\r\nhorizontal course roughly a mile below the plane. Almost immediately\r\nthey perceived that the unknown was actually a procession of six\r\nred-orange lights, glowing like hot coals. Shooting forward like\r\na stream of red tracer bullets, the line of lights moved out over\r\nChesapeake Bay until they were only about half a mile away from the\r\nplane. They appeared to be sharply defined, large, circular disks,\r\narranged in a narrow echelon formation--like a set of stairs tilted\r\nslightly to the plane’s right, with the leader at the lowest step,\r\neach following disk slightly higher and to the rear, and the last disk\r\nat the highest point (see Figure 18). Realizing that the line was\r\napparently going to pass under the plane at the right on the copilot’s\r\nside, Nash flipped off his seat belt so that he could move to the\r\nwindow on that side. During this brief interval he was not able to see\r\nthe objects, but Fortenberry kept them in view. As he later described\r\ntheir amazing behavior, all the disks simultaneously turned up on edge,\r\nlike coins, so that the glowing surfaces were tilted to the right.\r\nStill on edge, they suddenly reversed their relative places so that\r\ndisk 1 now occupied the last place in line and disk 6 became the leader.\r\n\r\nThis shift had taken only a brief second and was completed by the time\r\nNash reached the window. Both he and Fortenberry then observed the\r\ndisks flip back from the on-edge to the flat position. In the same\r\nfraction of a second, the entire line changed direction as abruptly\r\nas a ball bouncing off a wall and shot away to the west on a heading\r\nof 270 degrees. An instant later two similar disks darted out,\r\napparently from beneath the plane, and joined the line as numbers 7 and\r\n8 (Figure 18). The lights receded to the west, suddenly disappeared,\r\nimmediately reappeared, abruptly began a steep climb to an altitude\r\nabove that of the plane, then vanished not in sequence but in random\r\norder. The sighting had lasted for a period of twelve to fifteen\r\nseconds[XII-1, XII-5, XII-6, XII-7].\r\n\r\nAfter a quick check showed that no one else in the aircraft had\r\nobserved the lights, the pilots radioed a message to the CAA station\r\nat Norfolk for forwarding to the Norfolk Navy Base, reporting eight\r\nunidentified objects traveling at speeds in excess of 1000 miles\r\nan hour. In Miami, next morning, Air Force officials questioned\r\nboth witnesses. According to their estimates, the disks had moved\r\nhorizontally about 2000 feet above the ground until their final climb\r\nand disappearance, were about 100 feet in diameter, and about 15 feet\r\nthick. Since they apparently traveled fifty miles during the twelve to\r\nfifteen seconds they were in view, their velocity would have been 6000\r\nto 12,000 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nIntelligence officials first checked the air traffic. Five jets from\r\nLangley Air Force Base, near Newport News, had been in the region at\r\nthe time of the sighting, but they were ruled out as an explanation\r\nfor the disks. Both pilots were informed that seven other persons,\r\napparently on the ground, had reported unknown lights in the Norfolk\r\narea; the Air Force files contain no record of these reports and\r\nit is probable that some, at least, of these persons mistook the\r\nsunset-reddened jet trails for UFOs.\r\n\r\nFew sightings of unidentified aerial phenomena have been more clearly\r\ndescribed. Both witnesses were experienced pilots. Nash had flown\r\nmore than 10,000 hours at altitudes of 7000 to 8000 feet and had held\r\nthe rank of captain for eight years. Both men had been trained to\r\nobserve accurately, to check and double-check every factor that might\r\naffect safe flying, and to regard the word “assume” as a potential\r\nkiller. They shared the attitude of all cautious airmen: “In God we\r\ntrust--everyone else, we check.”[XII-5] Unlike many UFO descriptions,\r\ntheir report distinguished rigorously between fact and inference, and\r\nit included the exact time of the sighting as well as the position,\r\nheight, speed, and direction of flight of their plane. Using a kind of\r\n“instinct-judgment” gradually developed during their many hours in the\r\nair, they had made careful estimates of the position, height, speed,\r\nand direction of flight of the unknowns. Nevertheless, no reasonable\r\nexplanation of the disks was found.\r\n\r\nAt the time of this incident flying saucers had been big news for many\r\nweeks. Both _Life_ and _Look_ magazines had recently published serious\r\ndiscussions of the possibility that flying saucers came from other\r\nplanets, and newspapers were printing dozens of reports of weirdly\r\nglowing machines trailing fiery exhausts, streaking through the air at\r\nmeteoric speeds (see _Chapter_ VII). At ATIC, the small staff of nine\r\nmen was swamped with saucer reports, far more than they could deal with\r\nproperly, and some of the investigators were privately convinced that\r\nUFOs did come from outer space[XII-6]. For those or other reasons, the\r\nNorfolk sighting unquestionably received a less adequate study than\r\nwould a similar incident today. The case was dropped and filed as an\r\nUnknown.\r\n\r\nThe incredible velocity and instantaneous change of course reported\r\nwere obviously impossible for any earthly vehicle; no known metal\r\ncould have escaped being melted by the frictional heat produced during\r\nso swift a passage through the dense atmosphere at 2000 feet, and no\r\nhuman flesh and bone could have survived the smashing inertial forces\r\ninvolved in the instantaneous change of direction. Nash and Fortenberry\r\nfrankly stated their own conviction: “Though we don’t know what they\r\nwere, what they were doing here or where they came from, we are certain\r\nin our own minds that they were intelligently operated craft from\r\nsomewhere other than this planet.”[XII-7]\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Possible Explanation of the Nash-Fortenberry Disks_\r\n\r\nIn the hope of solving the mystery, even though a decade has passed,\r\nthe authors of this book have made a thorough study of the available\r\nevidence and present the results in the pages that follow.[D]\r\n\r\n[D] We wish to thank Professor C. A. Maney and Captain W. B. Nash for\r\ntheir generous help with this problem. Although they do not agree with\r\nour conclusions, Professor Maney has kindly made available certain\r\nuseful documents and Captain Nash in a lengthy correspondence has\r\npatiently answered a great many questions of detail.\r\n\r\nWhen puzzling observations in a laboratory seem to point to a\r\nconclusion that contradicts the main body of scientific knowledge,\r\nthe researcher first tries to repeat the experiment and duplicate\r\nthe observations. If this is impossible, as with the Chesapeake Bay\r\nphenomena, he next re-examines the assumptions on which the conclusion\r\nis based. The belief that the UFOs had an extraterrestrial origin is\r\nbased chiefly on two assumptions: first, that the estimates of the\r\ndisks’ size, distance, and speed were reasonably accurate; and second,\r\nthat the disks were solid objects. If either assumption is unsound, the\r\nextraterrestrial theory is unnecessary and the incident becomes much\r\nless of a puzzle.\r\n\r\nBoth witnesses were able and experienced observers. Nevertheless their\r\ndeterminations of distance and size, and hence of speed, are open to\r\nquestion because of the very fact that the disks were unidentified\r\nphenomena. Angular estimates are usually reliable when an observer is\r\njudging the position and speed of other known aircraft moving in the\r\nsky. But when the moving object is a strange one and is seen against\r\nan empty sky or flat ground containing no standards of comparison,\r\nestimates of actual size mean very little.\r\n\r\nThe ability to judge distance depends largely on the binocular vision\r\nof the observer’s eyes, separated by a span of about 2.5 inches.\r\nFocused on an object at 300 feet, they subtend an angle of about one\r\nfortieth of a degree, less than one tenth the diameter of the full\r\nmoon. This is a physiological fact, and means that if the observer\r\nis more than 300 feet away from an object of unknown size, he cannot\r\ndetermine its distance accurately unless he knows how large it is or\r\nunless he can compare it with a known object. Using angular estimates,\r\nthe witnesses in the Chesapeake Bay case calculated that at the point\r\nof closest approach the disks were a mile lower than the plane and\r\nabout half a mile to the north--a distance of roughly 7000 feet.\r\nMentally comparing their appearance with that of a DC-3 aircraft at\r\nthis distance, the observers arrived at an estimate of size--whose\r\naccuracy depends on having a known distance. The circularity of this\r\nprocess indicates the weakness of all the estimates given. Even the\r\nmost skillful observer cannot accurately judge the distance of an\r\nunidentified object when he does not know its true size, and he cannot\r\njudge the size unless he knows its actual distance.\r\n\r\nOver Norwich, Connecticut, on May 15, 1962, a cloudless day with\r\nperfect visibility, a Navy aircraft and a commercial-airlines plane\r\nreported a near collision at about 7000 feet. The Navy pilot filed\r\na complaint, stating that the two planes had missed each other by a\r\ndistance of only about 600 feet. According to the commercial pilot, who\r\ndid not file a complaint, the planes had had a leeway of about 4000\r\nfeet--a more than sixfold difference![XII-8]. Thus good pilots can\r\ndiffer widely in estimating the position of objects in the sky, even\r\nknown aircraft seen in full daylight. With an unrecognized phenomenon\r\nseen in darkness or in semidarkness, as in the Chesapeake Bay case,\r\ngood estimates are impossible.\r\n\r\nThe extraterrestrial conclusion depends even more strongly on the\r\nsecond assumption, that the UFOs were material objects. Nearly every\r\npart of the description is in direct conflict with this idea. The\r\ninstantaneous reversal of course, for example, if performed by solid\r\nobjects, should have produced a shock wave that would have broken\r\nwindows in Norfolk, Newport News, and points west. Only one observation\r\neven suggests that the unknowns had a material nature: when the disks\r\nflipped on edge they seemed to reveal bottom surfaces, which would\r\nindicate a solid body. The witnesses specifically qualified this\r\nstatement, however, by adding that though they had the impression\r\nthat the bottom surfaces were unlighted, the “bottoms” were not\r\nclearly visible. Thus the three-dimensional structure was not actually\r\nobserved, but only inferred. The night was dark, the UFOs were glowing\r\nlike hot coals, and were supposedly more than a mile away. Even if the\r\ndisks had been solid objects, an observer could actually have seen only\r\na circular-shaped light that suddenly narrowed to a very thin ellipse;\r\nif he believed the object to be solid, he might infer the presence of\r\nother surfaces, but a side edge 15 feet thick and an unlighted bottom\r\nsurface, even if they had existed, would not have been detectable.\r\n\r\nOf the other observations, all are inconsistent with the theory\r\nthat the UFOs were material in nature. All, however, are completely\r\nconsistent with the theory that the disks were immaterial images made\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nImages made of light can glow with brilliant colors, can show\r\nwell-defined circular shapes, and can flip on edge. Since they are\r\nnot subject to the forces of gravity and inertia, they can travel\r\nat incredible speed, change direction sharply and instantaneously,\r\nand perform all of the maneuvers ascribed to the UFOs. On this new\r\nassumption, the observations become credible and the major part of the\r\nmystery vanishes.\r\n\r\nOnly one problem remains. Just exactly what produced the images? Of\r\nthe many possible explanations, we first considered the simplest,\r\nan astronomical source. The UFOs appeared low in the western sky at\r\n8:12 P.M. E.S.T., about forty-five minutes after sunset. The night\r\nwas dark, for the moon had just entered its last quarter and did not\r\nrise until much later. Apparently the only planet that could have been\r\ninvolved was Mercury. Setting a little more than an hour after the\r\nsun, it should have been visible above the western horizon at the time\r\nof the sighting, but since it was not particularly brilliant, having\r\na magnitude of a little more than +0.6, we put aside the astronomical\r\ntheory, for the moment, as improbable.\r\n\r\nWe next explored the possibility of multiple reflections in the glass\r\nwindows of the cockpit, produced by a light source inside the plane\r\n(such as a cigarette), or in the air outside (such as the bright-red\r\nexhaust trail of one of the jets in the area). Like the astronomical\r\ntheory, this idea was set aside as improbable. Learning to distinguish\r\nbetween a reflection and a real light seen through a cockpit window\r\nis part of every pilot’s training. When he sees a strange light,\r\nhe automatically makes the proper checks. Furthermore, Nash and\r\nFortenberry had observed the disks through three separate windows\r\nhaving different orientations.\r\n\r\nAccepting the overwhelming probability that the source of the\r\nUFOs was outside and below the aircraft, we concluded that it was\r\nalmost certainly on the ground. The densely populated coastal\r\nregion near Newport News and Norfolk, with several airfields and\r\nmilitary installations, included countless possible sources such as a\r\nsearchlight, an illuminated advertising sign, an air beacon. Stratified\r\nclouds or inversion layers of temperature and/or humidity could have\r\nmultiplied such a light into a series of glowing disks (see Figure 19).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 19._ Searchlight shining on clouds. A, Through\r\nslightly foggy or dusty atmosphere, light cone plainly visible; B,\r\nthrough multiple thin cloud layers and foggy or dusty atmosphere; C,\r\non cloud layer through clear atmosphere, no light cone visible; D, on\r\nmultiple thin cloud layers, no light cone visible.]\r\n\r\nThe soundness of this theory depended on the prevailing weather\r\nconditions. According to the reports, on the night of July 14 roughly\r\na third of the sky at 20,000 feet was covered with thin cirrus clouds,\r\npractically invisible; at lower altitudes the night was cloudless and\r\nsharply clear, there was no apparent haze, visibility was unlimited,\r\nand no temperature inversion existed. Under such conditions the\r\nsuggested mechanism would obviously not operate.\r\n\r\nA more detailed survey of the weather conditions, however, quickly\r\nshowed that this picture was greatly oversimplified. At 8:12, the time\r\nof the sighting, the night had already become quite dark. Yet the sun\r\nhad set only forty-five minutes earlier and, according to the almanac,\r\ntwilight should not have ended until 9:01 local time. Thus there must\r\nhave been a dense cloud bank low in the west. Also, according to\r\nCaptain Nash, there was probably some unstable air, which in itself\r\nindicates inequalities of temperature and/or humidity.\r\n\r\nA thorough study of the situation showed that inversions of both\r\ntemperature and humidity must have been present. In the summer of 1952\r\nall the eastern states were suffering from an intense heat wave and\r\ndrought, and the ground cooled rapidly after sunset, because of the\r\nlack of cloud cover during the day. In a period of heat and drought,\r\nthe nightly cooling produces marked inversions favorable to extreme\r\nrefraction or reflection. Small in extent, existing only briefly in\r\none place, constantly changing location, such inversions may not be\r\ndetected by radiosonde observations[XII-9]. During July and August,\r\ntemperature inversions occurred almost every night in the coastal\r\nregions and accounted for the radar angels so frequently observed in\r\nthe Washington area during those weeks (see _Chapter_ VIII).\r\n\r\nThe fact that the sighting occurred over Chesapeake Bay is significant.\r\nA body of water cools more slowly than the land, and the air over water\r\nis warmer than that over land. The cooler air from the land is carried\r\nover the water by convection currents, flows in and under the warm air,\r\nis heated by the water and rises, to be replaced in turn by the further\r\nflow of cold air from the land. The air over a lake, river, or other\r\nbody of water also has a higher moisture content than over the land and\r\ncan form an invisible haze.\r\n\r\nAll these facts lead inescapably to the conclusion that sharp localized\r\ndiscontinuities of both temperature and humidity must have existed over\r\nChesapeake Bay on the night the UFOs appeared. A light on the Virginia\r\ncoast, shining northeast toward the plane, could easily have been\r\nspread out into a series of images like those observed. A change in the\r\norientation of the light or a shift in the location of the inversion\r\nwould account for the abrupt change of course made by the disks.\r\n\r\nSince the plane was flying at a ground speed of about 195 knots (225\r\nto 250 miles an hour), it would have traveled about a mile during the\r\ntwelve or fifteen seconds the disks were in view. This distance would\r\nhave changed the relation between moving plane and stationary ground\r\nlight, so that the images would no longer have been visible from the\r\nplane. By flying on, the witnesses left the phenomenon behind them.\r\n\r\nObviously this solution does not identify the particular beacon,\r\nsearchlight, or other ground light that produced the Chesapeake\r\nBay disks. But it does offer a highly probable explanation that is\r\nconsistent with all the observations and does not depend on the\r\npresence of an extraterrestrial spacecraft.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other UFOs in “Stack” Formation_\r\n\r\nA correspondent has reported a UFO sighting very similar to the Norfolk\r\ncase, almost certainly produced by the mechanism just described.\r\n\r\nIn the late spring of 1955 a physicist, Mr. Z, was driving west on\r\nthe highway between Dayton and Yakima, Washington, in a region of\r\nlow-lying hills. The time was shortly after dark; the sun had set but\r\nthere was still a suggestion of light in the west. Suddenly a line\r\nof five glowing UFOs appeared in the western sky, apparently three\r\nto five miles away, traveling east at high speed, and accelerating\r\nas they approached. Flying in a “stack” with the leading saucer on\r\ntop, the individual saucers were oriented in horizontal planes, but\r\neach follower was lower than and somewhat behind its predecessor so\r\nthat the entire formation was “like a stack of pancakes” leaning at\r\nabout a 45-degree angle toward the direction of flight. (Note that\r\nthis arrangement is the reverse analogue of that of the Chesapeake Bay\r\nUFOs.) The top saucer advanced more rapidly than the bottom one, so\r\nthat as they flashed through the sky at the left of the observer they\r\nappeared to be in single file. Startled, he stopped his car and got\r\nout to scan the sky, but the saucers had disappeared. Some fifteen to\r\ntwenty seconds later a similar formation appeared in the west. As they\r\napproached he could see that they were thin, flat disks, glowing with\r\na white light, sharply defined and circular in shape, and apparently\r\nfifty to a hundred feet in diameter. As they passed, the stack again\r\nspread out into single file. When they were apparently about ten miles\r\neast, the three lead saucers suddenly disappeared, while the two that\r\nhad been on the bottom made a sharp turn to the north, as abruptly as\r\nballs bouncing off a wall.\r\n\r\nConcluding that the saucers might be images produced by an airfield\r\nbeacon shining upward through very thin horizontal clouds, the observer\r\ncontinued to watch. They reappeared again and again, sometimes at the\r\ncorrect interval for an airfield beacon, but sometimes delaying for\r\ntwo or three minutes. To explain their occasional failure to appear\r\non schedule, he reasoned that some very dense, fast-moving, low-lying\r\nclouds must lie in the west between him and the beacon, so that\r\nsometimes the light could penetrate to shine on the assumed stratified\r\nlayers overhead, and sometimes not. After twenty minutes or so, the\r\nappearance of the phenomenon changed. The top three saucers merged\r\ngradually into an indistinct blur, while the bottom two remained sharp\r\nand distinct and continued to dart abruptly to the north just before\r\ndisappearing.\r\n\r\nAlthough the observer was not able to see the very thin layers of cloud\r\noverhead that would be required to account for the sharply defined\r\nshape of the saucers, he concluded that his explanation was the most\r\nreasonable one[XII-10].\r\n\r\nIn the Norfolk sighting, unfortunately, the witnesses could not easily\r\nhave remained in one place to watch for a possible reappearance of the\r\nUFOs. If they had circled and flown back, and had been able to find the\r\nexact location, they might have seen the disks again.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Tombaugh Rectangles_\r\n\r\nA remarkable phenomenon observed in New Mexico in the summer of 1949\r\nhas remained among the most puzzling of the Unknowns. As in the\r\nChesapeake Bay case, the facts are not in dispute. The witness was\r\nan astronomer, Clyde Tombaugh, at that time in charge of the optical\r\ninstrumentation of the rocket-firing program at the White Sands Missile\r\nRange. He had had thousands of hours of experience in observing the\r\nnight sky and when still a student had gained fame, after months of\r\npatient searching of photographic plates, by locating the image of the\r\nplanet Pluto near the position long predicted for it by Lowell and\r\nPickering.\r\n\r\nOn the night of August 20 Tombaugh was sitting with his wife and\r\nhis mother-in-law in the yard of his home in Las Cruces, watching\r\nthe stars. There was no moon, and the transparency of the sky was\r\nextraordinary, so that even the stars of sixth magnitude, usually\r\nbarely detectable by the naked eye, were clearly visible. About 10:45\r\nP.M. a geometrically spaced group of six to eight rectangles of light\r\nappeared almost directly overhead. Of low luminosity, they were\r\n“windowlike” in appearance and yellowish-green in color. The individual\r\nrectangles were quite small, not wider than four or five minutes of\r\narc, and the entire group covered a span of about 1 degree (about twice\r\nthat of the full moon). As they moved noiselessly in a vertical circle\r\npath toward the south-southeast, the individual rectangles became\r\nforeshortened, the span of the group became smaller, the lights turned\r\nbrownish and faded from view when 35 to 40 degrees above the horizon.\r\nThey had been in sight for about three seconds. Mrs. Tombaugh, who did\r\nnot see the lights until they had moved some distance from the zenith,\r\nobserved them for only about 1½ seconds before they disappeared. To her\r\nthey seemed a diffuse greenish glow, interconnecting a span of greenish\r\nspots of light. Her eyesight had always been less acute than that of\r\nher husband, and they attributed the difference in their descriptions\r\nto this difference in vision.\r\n\r\nAlthough Tombaugh had been too startled to count the number of\r\nrectangles or to note some other features he wondered about later, he\r\nimmediately recorded the facts of the observation, sketched the pattern\r\nof the formation, and noted his impression that the lights had been\r\npart of a rigid structure. He added, “I have done thousands of hours\r\nof night sky watching, but never saw a sight so strange as this.” A\r\nreport of this sighting was forwarded to Air Force officials, who could\r\nfind no explanation. UFO enthusiasts unhesitatingly pronounced the\r\nphenomenon a huge flying saucer--an interpretation that the witness\r\nhimself never made.\r\n\r\nThe accounts given to the public unfortunately suffer from various\r\ndistortions of fact. In its Cassandra-like warning of possible\r\nvisitors from other planets, _Life_ magazine included the Tombaugh\r\nsighting as one of the key cases and in a ten-sentence description\r\nmanaged to include at least six misstatements, some of which added to\r\nthe “uncanny” nature of the incident. According to this summary[XII-11]\r\nthe year was 1948 (it was 1949); the time was about 11:00 P.M. (it\r\nwas 10:45 P.M.); the lights were traveling south to north (they were\r\nmoving northwest to southeast); the object had an oval shape (Tombaugh\r\ndid not specify a shape); the lights exhibited a glare (they were of\r\nlow luminosity); their speed was too fast for a plane, too slow for\r\na meteor (no estimate of speed was given). On a nationwide TV show\r\nbroadcast in 1958 one of the speakers stated specifically that Tombaugh\r\nhad observed a cigar-shaped object with lighted portholes[XII-12]. An\r\n“artist’s conception” of the UFO in one publication[XII-13] depicts a\r\nlong, tapered ship with a line of lighted windows, wholly unrelated to\r\nTombaugh’s own sketch, which shows no unifying structure, merely six\r\nsmall rectangles arranged as though each one were at the corner of a\r\nhexagon (see Figure 20).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figure 20._ Tombaugh’s rectangles. Top, when first seen\r\nat zenith; bottom, a few seconds later at 50° above horizon. (Based on\r\nsketch by C. W. Tombaugh.)]\r\n\r\nWhile keeping an open mind on the possibility of interplanetary travel,\r\nTombaugh himself has never supported the spaceship interpretation so\r\noften attributed to him in print but has considered various possible\r\nexplanations--insects or birds illuminated by ground lights, or\r\nreflections of ground lights against the boundary of an inversion layer\r\nin the air. Of these, the inversion theory seems the most probable. The\r\nlayer in such a case must have been extremely thin or extremely weak,\r\notherwise it would have dimmed the brightness of the faint stars he was\r\nobserving. As in the Chesapeake Bay case, the mysterious rectangles\r\nwere undoubtedly the special effect of some unique combination of\r\ncircumstances, unlikely to be repeated. Conditions were ideal for\r\nthe formation of small sharply localized inversions: the weather was\r\nclear, the day had been hot. A small temperature inversion existing\r\nat a relatively low elevation and smoke, haze, or dust collecting in\r\na very thin layer at a relatively low altitude were the prerequisites\r\nthat almost certainly existed. Some unknown cause--in the vicinity\r\nof an airfield there are many possibilities--could have produced a\r\nripple in the thin haze layer. This ripple, tipping the haze layer at\r\na slight angle, could have reflected the lighted windows of a house;\r\nas the ripple progressed in a wavelike motion along the layer, the\r\nreflection would have moved as did the rectangles of light. Conditions\r\nof refraction at the interface would have reflected the wave upward.\r\n\r\nTombaugh has recently summarized his convictions on the entire UFO\r\nphenomenon as well as on his own sighting:\r\n\r\n“From my own studies of the solar system I cannot entertain any serious\r\npossibility for intelligent life on the other planets, not even for\r\nMars (the planet to which I have devoted considerable observation and\r\nstudy over the past thirty-five years). The logistics of visitations\r\nfrom planets revolving around the nearer stars is staggering. In\r\nconsideration of the hundreds of millions of years in the geologic\r\ntime scale when such visitations may possibly have occurred, the odds\r\nof a single visit in a given century or millennium are overwhelmingly\r\nagainst such an event.\r\n\r\n“A much more likely source of explanation is some natural optical\r\nphenomenon in our own atmosphere. In my 1949 sighting the faintness\r\nof the object, together with the manner of fading in intensity as it\r\ntraveled away from zenith towards the southeastern horizon, is quite\r\nsuggestive of a reflection from an optical boundary or surface of\r\nslight contrast in refractive index, as in an inversion layer.\r\n\r\n“I have never seen anything like it before or since, and I have spent\r\na lot of time where the night sky could be seen well. This suggests\r\nthat the phenomenon involves a comparatively rare set of conditions\r\nor circumstances to produce it, but nothing like the odds of an\r\ninterstellar visitation.”\r\n\r\n[XII-1] Air Force Files.\r\n\r\n[XII-1a] Menzel, D.

This agency (usually\r\nreferred to in this book as ATIC) has the responsibility of\r\ninvestigating all official reports of unidentified objects in our\r\nskies. Of the thousands of such incidents studied so far, none suggests\r\nthat the UFO in question came from outer space. In fact, the term UFO\r\nhas proven to be one of the worst misnomers of history. In the most\r\nperplexing cases, the phenomena reported are seldom material Objects,\r\nvery few of them are Flying and, when fully analyzed, almost none\r\nremain Unidentified.\r\n\r\nIdentifying strange objects in the air over the United States is\r\nvital to the country’s security. That military officers should be\r\nguilty of carelessness or casual guesswork in this serious business is\r\nunthinkable. Yet ATIC investigators, and through them the United States\r\nAir Force, of which they are members, for more than a decade have been\r\nthe target of vicious attacks by civilian enthusiasts devoted to the\r\ncult of flying saucers.\r\n\r\nBanded together in various “research” organizations and operating on\r\nthe premise that UFOs are interplanetary in origin, most of these\r\nenthusiasts flatly reject the normal explanations--planets, meteors,\r\nsatellites, balloons, reflections, birds, radar phantoms, hoaxes,\r\nor delusions. Flying saucers _obviously_ cruise in our skies, the\r\nbelievers argue, and the Air Force failure to admit the obvious proves\r\nthat its investigators are incompetent or dishonest or both, and that\r\nthey are involved in a giant conspiracy to conceal the truth from the\r\nAmerican public[XIII-1].\r\n\r\nIn the view of the saucer groups, the Air Force can do no right. If,\r\nafter receiving a UFO report, the investigators require some time to\r\ncollect all the relevant facts and to reach a sound conclusion, they\r\nare berated for the delay and accused of cover-up tactics, as in the\r\nKillian case (p. 52). On the other hand, when the answer is found\r\nquickly and released to the newspapers, UFO addicts deny its truth and\r\nassert that the explanation was hurriedly rushed into print in order\r\nto deceive the public, as in the Pacific sighting on July 11, 1959 (p.\r\n106)[XIII-1a, p. 8]. Some of these peculiar beliefs may rest on an\r\nimperfect understanding of the actual aims, methods, and resources of\r\nAir Force investigators.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Official Study of UFOs_\r\n\r\nThe report of an unidentified flying object, in about 90 per cent of\r\nthe cases, comes first from an ordinary private citizen, who often\r\nnotifies the local newspaper or radio station. Not until he reports the\r\nincident to a military official, however, is ATIC empowered to start\r\ninvestigation. The commanding officer at the Air Force base nearest the\r\nplace of the sighting then makes a preliminary investigation and, if\r\nthe facts seem to warrant further study, forwards the information to\r\nDayton for evaluation.\r\n\r\nWith years of experience to draw on, the Aerial Phenomena Group\r\ncan often identify the unknown after a brief study of the report.\r\nIf not, they try to determine whether the report contains all the\r\nfacts necessary for an explanation and whether the unknown may be of\r\ninterest to Intelligence officers. Does it represent a possible danger\r\nto the nation? Does it have possible military significance? Does it\r\nhave possible scientific or technical significance? If, after this\r\nreview, the investigators conclude that the unknown might be of some\r\nimportance, they carry out an intensive study in which they may have\r\nthe help of an organization directly connected with the Assistant\r\nChief of Staff for Intelligence or of allied Intelligence agencies.\r\nWhen all the relevant facts are collected, a survey usually shows\r\nthat the unknown fits a particular class of sighting. To complete the\r\nidentification, ATIC can call on the expert knowledge of a specialist\r\nin the type of phenomenon involved.\r\n\r\nExpert help is available from a large variety of sources:\r\n\r\n1. Official consultant to the Air Force, Dr. J. Allen Hynek, Director\r\nof the Dearborn Observatory and Professor of Astronomy at Northwestern\r\nUniversity, formerly Assistant Director, Smithsonian Astrophysical\r\nObservatory.\r\n\r\n2. Members of the Air Force with special scientific and technical\r\ntraining, whose full duty is the study, investigation, and analysis of\r\nUFO reports.\r\n\r\n3. A panel of military and civilian experts in all branches of science\r\nand technology.\r\n\r\n4. The scientific and technical laboratories (photographic, ballistic,\r\nchemical, etc.) of all branches of the Air Force and of other\r\ngovernment agencies.\r\n\r\n5. The meteorological records of the United States Weather Bureau, the\r\nUnited States Coast Guard, and other government agencies.\r\n\r\n6. Commercial laboratories under contract to carry out special work.\r\n\r\nWith the best scientific resources of the nation available, the Air\r\nForce can make sure that a puzzling UFO phenomenon will undergo study\r\nby an expert. Reports involving radar sightings are analyzed by the\r\nresearch scientists who know most about the behavior of radar. If\r\nsatellites or astronomical objects might be involved, astronomers study\r\nthe evidence. If the report includes photographs or physical evidence,\r\nexperts provide the appropriate laboratory analysis. If a UFO still\r\nproves difficult to explain, the complete facts are laid before a\r\npanel of experts for discussion. When a sighting has been completely\r\nanalyzed, the conclusions--known or unknown--are filed with the record\r\nof the case. If the newspapers have publicized the incident, a summary\r\nof the analysis is given to SAFIS (Office of Information Services,\r\nOffice of the Secretary of the Air Force) for release to the press.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the flying-saucer saga, almost none of the men\r\nassigned to investigate UFOs had any special training in the optical\r\nand astronomical sciences or in investigative techniques. Since the\r\nspecific facts of so many cases were classified, civilian scientists\r\nwho might have helped explain the UFO puzzles were not able to get the\r\nnecessary information. Unsurprisingly, the percentage of unexplained\r\ncases sometimes reached as high as 5 to 10 per cent, and once reached\r\nthe staggering peak of 20 per cent! In recent years the techniques\r\nof collection, investigation, and analysis of the facts have greatly\r\nimproved. Air Force investigators not only have excellent training,\r\nthey also have a solid body of experience behind them. In later reviews\r\nthey have found the answers to many, but not to all, of the backlog\r\nof “Unknown” cases which, if reported today, would probably cause no\r\nproblem. Some of the old cases will probably never be solved because\r\nthe men in charge at the time did not always know what questions to\r\nask. Essential information was not obtained and can never be obtained\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force never closes an unsolved case. Reports that have been\r\nlisted as Unidentified or Insufficient Evidence are reanalyzed when new\r\nevidence becomes available. Occasionally new evidence produces a more\r\ncomplete or even a different explanation for a case that was previously\r\nconsidered probably solved.\r\n\r\nStatistical summaries of the UFO sightings for each month and for\r\neach period of six months are forwarded to SAFIS for release. In\r\nrecent years ATIC has been receiving fewer than 600 reports per year\r\nand solving about 98 per cent. In 1961, 578 UFOs were reported. Of\r\nthose in which all the necessary information was available, all but\r\nthirteen--about two per cent--were completely explained.\r\n\r\nBelievers in flying saucers tend to ignore the 98 per cent of cases\r\nfully explained by the Air Force, and to focus attention on the 2 per\r\ncent that remain puzzling. Yet no distinguishable difference exists\r\nbetween the types of observation described in solved and in unsolved\r\ncases. From considering the original reports, the competence of the\r\nwitnesses, and the appearance and movements of the various UFOs, no\r\nanalyst could predict in advance which will be fully accounted for and\r\nwhich will not. The witnesses (often technically trained observers or\r\nexperienced airmen) in the cases that are solved are just as reliable\r\nas--and no less so than--the witnesses in the unexplained cases. They\r\nreport the same classes of phenomena--glowing UFOs, hovering UFOs, UFOs\r\nmoving at high velocities, making incredible maneuvers, and behaving as\r\nthough under intelligent control.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force has accounted for nearly all of these flying saucers.\r\nThe various causes included aircraft, balloons, satellites, mirages,\r\ninversions, hoaxes, delusions, reflections, birds, lenticular clouds,\r\nball lightning, radar anomalies, sundogs, meteors, planets, stars,\r\nthe Aurora, and other astronomical phenomena. The few remaining\r\ncases report similar observations and undoubtedly have one of these\r\ncauses--which cannot be proved because some essential fact is\r\nmissing. No data in these unsolved cases suggest that the UFOs had an\r\ninterplanetary origin or that they constituted a threat to the security\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\nWhen Air Force investigators have determined that a UFO report does\r\nnot represent anything of interest to Intelligence, their primary duty\r\nends. However, since many UFO puzzles are of interest for scientific\r\nor technical reasons, the investigators try to find the specific\r\nexplanation of each case and, if it has attracted public attention,\r\ngive the final solution to the press.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Civilian Saucer Groups_\r\n\r\nSince the first flying saucers were reported in 1947, dozens of\r\ncivilian clubs have been organized throughout the world to collect UFO\r\nreports and publish “the truth” allegedly suppressed by government\r\nsources. During the last decade the roster in the United States has\r\nincluded such groups as the Borderland Sciences Research Associates\r\n(California), Interplanetary Intelligence of Unidentified Flying\r\nObjects (Oklahoma), Intercontinental Aerial Research Foundation\r\n(Nebraska), UFO Research Committee (Ohio), Civilian Saucer Intelligence\r\n(New York), Waukegan Contact Group (Illinois), Saucer Investigative\r\nResearch Organization (Georgia), World Society of the Flying Saucer\r\n(Idaho), Civilian Research on Interplanetary Flying Objects (Ohio), and\r\nthe National Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (Washington,\r\nD.C.). The oldest of these saucer clubs, the Aerial Phenomena Research\r\nOrganization (Arizona) was founded in 1952 and issues a bimonthly news\r\nsheet, the _APRO Bulletin_. More or less regular publications (some\r\nnow defunct) of these groups have included the _Cosmic Researcher_,\r\n_Interplanetary News Service_, _CRIFO Orbit_, _Saucerian Bulletin_,\r\nand _UFO Critical Bulletin_. In recent years some of the best factual\r\naccounts of UFO incidents (as well as some of the weirdest speculation)\r\nhave appeared in the magazine _Flying Saucers_, which is not connected\r\nwith any club.\r\n\r\nA few clubs, chiefly in California, are semireligious in character,\r\nclaiming repeated communication with ethereal beings in space. Some\r\nclubs accept “contact” stories as valid, others do not. Certain\r\narticles of faith are apparently common to all such groups: that UFOs\r\nare actually vehicles from outer space; that they sometimes land on\r\nearth and occasionally leave physical traces in the form of metallic\r\nor organic substances; that scientists who cannot accept these beliefs\r\nare hypocrites, archfiends, anti-Galileo reactionaries, stooges for\r\nthe Army or the Air Force, and members of the conspiracy to delude the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n_NICAP_\r\n\r\nThe largest and probably the most influential saucer group is the\r\nNational Investigations Committee on Aerial Phenomena (NICAP), with\r\naffiliated subcommittees in various parts of the country. Many\r\nmembers of local organizations such as the UFO Research Committee of\r\nAkron, Ohio, also belong to NICAP and help maintain close liaison.\r\nThe bimonthly news sheet, the _UFO Investigator_, is distributed to\r\nmembers of NICAP and to prominent persons in the government and other\r\nfields; it regularly lists recent UFO sightings reported by members,\r\nand occasionally prints a detailed report of a specific case. Few of\r\nthe sightings reported can be independently evaluated because the\r\naccounts often omit such essential facts as exact times, dates, places,\r\ndirection of motion, etc.\r\n\r\nWith headquarters in Washington, D.C., NICAP strongly reflects the\r\nviews of its director, Major Donald E. Keyhoe, USMC (Ret.), that UFOs\r\nmay be interplanetary in origin, sometimes land on earth, but rarely\r\nif ever make contact with human beings. Like most saucer believers,\r\nmany members of NICAP tend to assume without adequate investigation\r\nthat many unusual sky phenomena reported in the newspapers may be\r\nextraterrestrial objects, and they often maintain this attitude in\r\nthe face of overwhelming evidence to the contrary. When the BOAC\r\nComet exploded near Calcutta on May 2, 1953, Major Keyhoe theorized\r\nthat a UFO might accidentally or deliberately have collided with the\r\nplane. He continued such speculation even after British aviation\r\nofficials announced, after months of study, that the crash was caused\r\nby metal fatigue[XIII-1]. Many of the items printed in the _UFO\r\nInvestigator_ are based on incomplete evidence. Under the headline\r\n“Strange Series of Fireballs Reported,” NICAP listed a UFO observed on\r\nMarch 7, 1960, at about 8:10 P.M., visible from the Canadian border\r\nto Florida, and described by some observers as three or four UFOs\r\nflying in formation[XIII-3]. This phenomenon was actually the satellite\r\nDiscoverer VIII making its final descent to earth.\r\n\r\nNICAP membership is theoretically open to any non-Communist\r\ncitizen[XIII-4], but applicants from the “contactee” fringe are not\r\nencouraged. The committee once canceled the membership of a space\r\nevangelist when he claimed publicly to be a spokesman for NICAP, and in\r\n1958 it canceled the membership of seven famous contactees who had been\r\nadmitted without the knowledge of the director[XIII-5].\r\n\r\nInvestigations are carried out as spare-time projects of the\r\nmembers themselves, some of whom constitute an advisory panel\r\nof experts. Although many are highly respected in their own\r\nprofessions--television, journalism, military science, religion,\r\ngovernment, aviation, engineering, medicine, psychology, and teaching\r\nin the physical sciences--few are recognized specialists in the fields\r\nrequired for the analysis of most UFO cases--radar propagation, the\r\nphysics of optics, meteorology, and astronomy.\r\n\r\nSince 1957 a major goal of NICAP has been a Congressional inquiry that\r\nsupposedly would reveal an Air Force conspiracy to deny the reality of\r\nflying saucers[XIII-7]. In 1957 the director lodged a formal complaint\r\nwith a member of the United States Senate charging that the Air Force\r\ncontinually made false statements on UFOs to the press, the public,\r\nand members of Congress. In support of this accusation Major Keyhoe\r\nsubmitted summaries of more than two hundred incidents[XIII-7].\r\n\r\nThe list cited a number of UFO reports that had never been submitted\r\nto the Air Force for analysis. These included reports from foreign\r\ncountries (one in Sumatra in 1944 and one Holland in 1952) and from\r\nNICAP’s private files. Others, such as the Kinross case (p. 154), had\r\nnot been within ATIC jurisdiction. Many others, such as the Mantell\r\n(p. 33) and the Chiles-Whitted (p. 108) cases, had long ago been fully\r\nexplained. Still other cases, dating from the early days of the saucer\r\nera, remain unsolved only because vital facts, not determined at the\r\ntime of the sighting, are necessary to a full explanation but cannot\r\nnow be ascertained. The request for a Congressional inquiry was denied\r\nbut has been repeated at intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The “Conspiracy” Fantasy_\r\n\r\nMost UFO organizations cling to the belief that a conspiracy exists to\r\nconceal the existence of extraterrestrial vehicles, but they disagree\r\non its precise composition. To NICAP and its affiliates, the chief\r\nculprit is the Air Force, helped occasionally by other government\r\nagencies and by well-known civilian scientists. APRO (Aerial Phenomena\r\nResearch Organization), however, considers that the Air Force is\r\ninvolved only as the tool of still more powerful forces. The director\r\nof APRO has published her conviction that nobody in the Air Force,\r\nthe Navy, or the Marines “has the brains” to contrive so successful a\r\nscheme and that the alleged plot “could only be borne [_sic_] of minds\r\nschooled in deception and contraception [_sic_]--the elite corps of the\r\nCentral Intelligence Agency.”[XIII-8] In still another version (which\r\nmakes the plots of E. Phillips Oppenheim seem amateurish) NICAP itself\r\nis a pawn in a superconspiracy so vast that thousands of American\r\ncitizens have been made its unknowing tools[XIII-9]. The hundreds of\r\nstrange phenomena observed in the skies, the controversial photographs\r\nof UFOs, the “spacemen” who visited Adamski and others, the “contact”\r\nand little-green-men stories, the analyses made by the Air Force, the\r\nformation of the various saucer clubs, NICAP and its war against the\r\nAir Force--all these phenomena, events, and persons are allegedly parts\r\nof a colossal drama planned, supported, and staged as a deliberate hoax\r\non the American public. The prime mover is supposed to be the Central\r\nIntelligence Agency, whose motive is to conceal--something; just what\r\nis not clear[XIII-10].\r\n\r\nIn comparison with this fantasy, NICAP’s charges of simple Air Force\r\ncover-up seem tame.\r\n\r\n\r\n_UFO at Sheffield Lake, Ohio_\r\n\r\nOne of the most notorious accusations of Air Force skulduggery, made\r\nin attempts to procure a Congressional inquiry, was that embodied in\r\na saucerian study of the Fitzgerald sighting[XIII-11], published by\r\nthe UFO Research Committee of Akron, Ohio, which maintains a close\r\nrelationship with NICAP. Although the case was unimportant and was\r\ncompletely explained, we shall discuss it in detail to illustrate the\r\npeculiar views and methods of the flying-saucer groups.\r\n\r\nIn summary, a strange light observed on a dark night for roughly half a\r\nminute by a drowsy housewife was converted into a weapon to attack the\r\nAir Force. The incident inspired thousands of words of argument, caused\r\nthe publication and distribution of a lengthy document, used the time\r\nof busy investigators, required an otherwise unnecessary expenditure of\r\npublic funds, and evoked an exchange of letters among angry citizens,\r\nharassed Congressmen, and equally harassed Air Force officials. In all\r\nUFO history, no larger mountain has ever been made from so small a\r\nmolehill.\r\n\r\nOn September 30, 1958, the Air Technical Intelligence Center at\r\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base received a letter from Mrs. William\r\nFitzgerald of Sheffield Lake, Ohio, reporting that on September 21\r\nshe had sighted a UFO which she would like to have investigated. She\r\nenclosed a three-page summary prepared by members of the UFO Research\r\nCommittee of Akron, and added, “I assure you that I will contact my\r\ncongressman about this matter if some action is not taken soon to\r\nexplain it.”[XIII-12]\r\n\r\nThe alleged UFO had appeared at about 3 A.M. in the yard of the\r\none-story, two-bedroom house occupied by Mrs. Fitzgerald and her\r\nhusband. She had been sitting up alone watching television and had\r\ngone to bed at the end of the late movie. The bedroom window was shut\r\nand the window curtains were closed. Outside, the night was dark; the\r\nmoon had set, there were no street lights, and none of the neighboring\r\nhouses was lighted. Lying with her arm over her eyes, trying to get to\r\nsleep, she suddenly realized that the room was illuminated and stood\r\nup on the bed to look out of the window.\r\n\r\nAccording to her account, a disk-shaped object with a hump in the\r\nmiddle, a dull aluminum in color, was moving across the yard at a\r\nheight of about five feet. The object did not glow and did not have\r\nlights on it; she could not determine the source of the light that\r\nmade it visible to her. About twenty to twenty-two feet in diameter\r\nand about six feet high, the UFO moved north across the driveway into\r\na neighbor’s yard, losing altitude on the way until it was only one\r\nfoot above the ground. At a distance of fifty feet, it stopped and\r\nfloated motionless for several seconds while pink-gray smoke billowed\r\nout from two openings in the rim and illuminated the UFO. Each opening\r\ncontained seven pipes. The smoke did not come from the pipes but from\r\nthe openings from which the pipes projected. The object then moved back\r\ninto the witness’s yard, rising to a height of five feet. No longer\r\nemitting smoke, it made two quick clockwise turns with a radius of\r\nabout three feet, and rose straight up. The roof of the house, jutting\r\nout over the window, cut it from further view. During the entire time\r\nof the sighting, about thirty-six seconds, she had heard a muffled\r\nnoise like that of a jet engine warming up. She had tried several times\r\nto waken her husband, by kicking him, but without success. When the\r\nobject had gone, she went back to bed and slept.\r\n\r\nWhen she awoke at 11:00 the next morning and mentioned her experience\r\nto the family, she learned that ten-year-old John Fitzgerald, sleeping\r\nin the second bedroom, had also seen a strange light. He had apparently\r\nwakened during the night to go to the bathroom and had returned to bed,\r\nwhen he saw a bright light shining into his room and heard an unusual\r\nnoise. Climbing up on the radiator to look out of his window, he saw\r\nsomething the color of a tin cup moving across the yard. After watching\r\nfor a few seconds until the light had gone, he went to bed and to sleep.\r\n\r\nPuzzled by the incident, Mrs. Fitzgerald telephoned the local\r\nnewspaper, the Lorain _Journal_, and the story appeared in several Ohio\r\nnewspapers. Members of the Akron Committee, one of whom lived in the\r\nnearby town of Lorain, soon arrived to question her and prepare the\r\nsummary of her experience. Other witnesses in Lorain were reported to\r\nhave seen the same UFO.\r\n\r\nEven at first glance, the situation presented several unusual features.\r\nThe witness had delayed more than a week before notifying Air Force\r\ninvestigators, yet she threatened to notify her congressman unless some\r\naction were taken soon. She had not waited for action, however, but by\r\nthe same mail had written to her congressman requesting him to obtain\r\nan explanation from the Air Force. The summary of her experience,\r\nprepared with the help of members of the UFO Research Committee of\r\nAkron, was equally remarkable. Even though her dark-adapted eyes had\r\njust been assaulted by a bright light and the object had been in view\r\nfor a maximum of only thirty-six seconds, she provided a description so\r\ndetailed that it almost suggested a photographic memory.\r\n\r\nOn October 3, three days after her letter reached ATIC, two Air Force\r\nmen, Technical Sergeant A and Technical Sergeant B, who were specially\r\ntrained in the investigation of UFO incidents, arrived in Lorain. After\r\na day spent in studying such pertinent matters as the local geography,\r\nthe records of the Weather Bureau, the Coast Guard station, and the\r\nlocal railway, on October 4 they called on the witnesses.\r\n\r\nAgain the situation was unusual. Mrs. Fitzgerald’s husband did not\r\nappear. With Mrs. Fitzgerald and young John, however, was Mr. C, the\r\nmember of the local UFO group who had spent several days helping her\r\nprepare her account. To the amazement of the sergeants, Mr. C seemed to\r\nassume that he was in charge of the interview, answered the questions\r\nput to Mrs. Fitzgerald, and continually interrupted with questions\r\nand statements of his own. After half an hour of this frustrating\r\nprocedure, Sergeant A led Mr. C out into the yard. In the house,\r\nSergeant B resumed the inquiry and filled out the official report form.\r\n\r\nFew questions were asked of the boy because both the details and the\r\nphraseology of his description seemed to echo adult conversations\r\noverheard during the two weeks that had elapsed since the sighting.\r\nAccording to the account prepared by the Akron Committee, the boy had\r\nbeen frightened by a light so bright that he had to shield his eyes.\r\n(The time was unknown, and the light may or may not have been the one\r\nobserved by Mrs. Fitzgerald.) Climbing on top of the radiator to look\r\nout of the window, he had seen the UFO and watched it take off into\r\nthe air, and then had gone back to bed and to sleep. Sergeant B had\r\na young son of about the same age. That a normal ten-year-old boy\r\nshould not call out and try to awaken the household when confronted\r\nwith a whirling, humming, dome-shaped spaceship some twenty-two feet in\r\ndiameter and six feet high, moving through his own yard in the middle\r\nof the night, seemed too improbable to warrant serious questioning.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing with the Fitzgeralds, the sergeants called on other\r\nsupposed witnesses in Lorain. Satisfied that they had completed a\r\nthorough investigation, they returned to Dayton and presented the\r\ninformation to their superior officers for evaluation. None of the\r\nevidence suggested that the phenomenon had been a spacecraft[XIII-12].\r\nThe UFO had been the “special effect” of a peculiar combination of\r\ncircumstances:\r\n\r\n    1. The time. The sighting had occurred about 3 A.M.; the exact\r\n    moment was not known and could not be determined.\r\n\r\n    2. The geography. The shore of Lake Erie lay about three fifths\r\n    of a mile north of the Fitzgerald house. South of the house,\r\n    roughly 100 yards away, ran the tracks of the New York Central\r\n    Railway. Southwest of the house about one and a half miles\r\n    stood a steel foundry.\r\n\r\n    3. The weather. A drizzling rain was falling at the time of the\r\n    sighting. There was some haze and wind; no moonlight.\r\n\r\n    4. Other factors, (a) Between midnight and 4 A.M. a Coast Guard\r\n    cutter equipped with an eight-inch spotlight had been plying\r\n    back and forth on Lake Erie, searching for an overdue cabin\r\n    cruiser. At about 3 A.M. the cutter had been headed east toward\r\n    Lorain, reaching there at 3:15, had then continued east beyond\r\n    Sheffield to Avon, before turning back to the Lorain lifeboat\r\n    station and berthing at 4 A.M. (b) At 2:52 A.M. a train had\r\n    left the Lorain railroad station, roughly three miles from\r\n    the Fitzgerald house. Eight minutes later it would have been\r\n    passing south of the house at a distance of about 100 yards.\r\n    The engine was using a rotating headlight.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts it was possible to reconstruct the probable sequence\r\nof events that produced the UFO: In the hour or so before the sighting,\r\nthe witness had been sitting up alone watching the late movie on TV.\r\nThe film that night was a horror movie, _Dracula’s Daughter_. About 3\r\nA.M., soon after the witness had gone to bed, the Coast Guard cutter\r\non Lake Erie was traveling east toward Lorain, was very near the harbor\r\nand was flashing its spotlight toward shore. The light had briefly\r\nilluminated the two bedrooms of the Fitzgerald house and had roused\r\nMrs. Fitzgerald. At that distance, between three and four miles, the\r\nbeam would have spread and would have been dispersed still more by the\r\ndrops of rain falling. By the time Mrs. Fitzgerald reached the window\r\nand pulled back the curtains, the searchlight was gone. At the same\r\ntime, however, the train that left Lorain at 2:52 was passing south of\r\nthe house, using its rotating headlight and producing a roaring noise\r\nmade more piercing by the moist atmosphere. Looking through the wet\r\nglass of the window, the witness saw the beam of the train’s headlight\r\nmoving through the haze in the yard. Smoke from the nearby foundry was\r\nalso being blown into the yard. Illuminated by the circular beam of\r\nlight, the smoke seemed to be a glowing, solid object that moved back\r\nand forth and emitted clouds of gray-pink smoke.\r\n\r\nIn summary, the Air Force concluded that Mrs. Fitzgerald’s UFO was\r\nan illusion produced by a combination of factors: an excited frame\r\nof mind induced by _Dracula’s Daughter_, the spotlight on the Coast\r\nGuard cutter, the rotating headlight of the train and the noise of its\r\nengine, drifting smoke from the foundry, and the haze of the drizzly\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion provoked an explosion from the witness, who wrote her\r\ncongressman suggesting mental incompetence on the part of the Air Force\r\nofficial who analyzed the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n“_The Fitzgerald Report_”\r\n\r\nThe UFO Research Committee compiled and on December 1, 1958, published\r\na thirteen-page pamphlet (later reissued in amplified form and\r\ncopyrighted) entitled: “The Fitzgerald Report, A Complete and Detailed\r\nAccount of the Sighting of an Unidentified Flying Object, Sheffield\r\nLake, Ohio, September 21, 1958.” This document charged “duplicity”\r\nin the Air Force treatment of UFO reports in general, and asserted\r\nthat the Fitzgerald investigation in particular had been “criminally\r\nmishandled” and was a “disgrace to the U. S. Air Force and an insult\r\nto the American public....” It further suggested that Sergeants A and\r\nB be “disciplined” because their investigation was not adequate or\r\nthorough, and that they had had “little or no intention of making an\r\nhonest investigation of this sighting.”\r\n\r\nCopies of the pamphlet were mailed to eminent scientists throughout\r\nthe country, members of the United States House of Representatives and\r\nthe United States Senate, officers in the Air Force, the Secretary of\r\nthe Air Force, and the Secretary of Defense. The publication of such\r\ncharges against an ordinary private citizen might easily have caused\r\na suit for libel. The Air Force investigators, whatever their private\r\nreactions may have been, had no such recourse; their accusers could act\r\nwith fair assurance of immunity from legal action.\r\n\r\nThe document made a number of specific accusations. Because of the\r\nwide publicity given this attack, we shall discuss each point fully.\r\nOur comments, appended in brackets, are based on official records of\r\nthe Air Force, the New York Central Railway, the United States Weather\r\nBureau, and the United States Coast Guard. Most of these facts were\r\navailable to the Akron Committee itself.\r\n\r\n_Charge 1._ Because of the position of the Fitzgerald house, the\r\nheadlight of the train could not have shone into the bedroom windows.\r\n[Correct. But the point is irrelevant. The Air Force did not suggest\r\nthat the train’s light shone into the window. The light could have\r\nshone into the yard, however, and would have been visible to a witness\r\nlooking out of the window. The brilliant light that flashed in the\r\nwindow and roused the witness did not come from the train but from the\r\nspotlight of the Coast Guard cutter.]\r\n\r\n_Charge 2._ Events taking place on the lake could not have had any\r\nrelation to the sighting because the shore was 3000 feet away and,\r\nbecause of intervening houses and trees, a witness in the Fitzgerald\r\nhouse could not see the lake. [Incorrect conclusion from the facts. The\r\nbeam of a spotlight on a boat moving one or two miles offshore (as was\r\nthe Coast Guard cutter at about 3 A.M.) could have been seen from the\r\nhouse. The beam of such a light can be visible for great distances.\r\nReflected from the clouds and spread by the drops of moisture in\r\nthe air, it could easily have flashed into the window with great\r\nbrilliance.]\r\n\r\n_Charge 3a._ The spotlight used by the Coast Guard cutter was of a\r\ntype that could not be focused like a searchlight; therefore the beam\r\ncould not have been reflected from the clouds to the Fitzgerald house.\r\n[Incorrect. The spotlight used could operate with either a diffuse or a\r\nnarrow beam, could be focused like a searchlight, and could have been\r\nreflected from the clouds to the house.]\r\n\r\n_Charge 3b._ The Coast Guard cutter had used its spotlight and turned\r\nthe beam in the direction of the house only once that night, while\r\nsignaling another boat at a time two hours earlier than the sighting\r\nand a place roughly five miles from the house. [The December 1, 1958,\r\nedition of the document gives the distance as 4½ miles; the 1959\r\nedition gives 5½ miles. Whatever the true distance, the statement is\r\nincorrect. A signaling incident did occur at the time and about the\r\nplace specified, but it had no relation to the Fitzgerald sighting. The\r\nlight was used frequently in the hours between midnight and 4 A.M., as\r\nthe cutter carried out its search for the missing cabin cruiser. In a\r\nstatement obtained by the Akron Committee itself, the chief boatswain’s\r\nmate affirmed that “subject spotlight was flashed on and off a number\r\nof times during the night, picking up objects in all directions. It\r\nis hard to estimate how many times spotlights were snapped on and off\r\nduring subject search, but they were used quite often during short\r\nperiods of time.”]\r\n\r\n_Charge 4._ The statement that the supposed confirmatory witness, Mrs.\r\nS, could not recall anything unusual for the night of the sighting\r\nwas “a lie,” as evidenced by her signed statement. [Incorrect. When\r\nthe investigators visited Mrs. S, she asserted that she had nothing\r\nto contribute. At about 2:30 A.M. (half an hour earlier than the\r\nFitzgerald sighting) she had indeed noticed a bright-red glow that\r\nhad startled her at first until she realized that it probably came\r\nfrom the nearby Ohio Edison plant or from the foundry. The signed\r\nstatement printed by the Akron Committee in the December 1958 edition\r\nof the document bears no date. The notarized statement used in the 1959\r\nedition is dated March 25, six months after the sighting had occurred.\r\nAfter the Air Force interview, apparently, Mrs. S had changed her mind\r\nfor reasons unknown.]\r\n\r\n_Charge 5._ The statement that another confirmatory witness, Mr. G,\r\nwas not available for interview was “pathetic” because it was Mrs.\r\nG, not Mr. G, who saw the UFO. [The point of this accusation is not\r\nclear. Because of a typographical error in a letter, “Mrs.” was changed\r\nto “Mr.” The fact remains that the supposed witness, Mrs. G, was not\r\navailable. Also, the light she reported had appeared about 2 A.M., an\r\nhour before the Fitzgerald sighting.]\r\n\r\n_Charge 6a._ It was not true that a misty rain with haze and mist had\r\noccurred at the time of the sighting; the witness herself stated that\r\nit was not raining. [Incorrect. The Cleveland Weather Bureau recorded\r\ncontinual slight precipitation between midnight and 7 A.M.: .20 inches\r\nwere recorded between 2 and 4 A.M. When asked whether it was raining\r\nwhen she saw the UFO, the witness replied, “It had rained a few hours\r\nbefore,” a vague response suggesting that she had not noticed the\r\nweather at the time of the sighting. Other parts of her account,\r\nhowever, strongly indicate rain. Although the night was warm (about 65\r\ndegrees F. at 3 A.M.), her bedroom window was closed.]\r\n\r\n_Charge 6b._ It was not true that smoke from the steel plant southwest\r\nof the house could have been a factor in the sighting, because the\r\ndirection of the wind was wrong. [Incorrect. The Weather Bureau\r\nrecorded “WSW and SW” winds that night averaging ten miles an hour;\r\ncoming from the southwest, the winds would have blown the smoke\r\nnortheast, directly toward the house.]\r\n\r\n_Charge 7a._ The sergeants did not make a house-to-house check among\r\nthe neighbors to obtain confirmatory evidence. [Correct. Such a\r\ntime-consuming procedure would not have been justified. The neighbors\r\nhad had two weeks in which to report a visiting spaceship. No such\r\nreport had been made, even by the neighbor in whose yard the noisy\r\nobject was supposed to have hovered while emitting puffs of smoke.]\r\n\r\n_Charge 7b._ They did not ask Mrs. Fitzgerald to make a drawing of the\r\nUFO. [Correct. Before their visit she had already made such a drawing,\r\nprepared with the help of members of the Akron Committee who had shown\r\nher a sketch of an alleged spaceship reproduced several years earlier\r\nin an Air Force pamphlet[XIII-13]. With this sketch before her to\r\naid her memory, Mrs. Fitzgerald had described her UFO to a draftsman\r\nprovided by the committee. Unsurprisingly, the resulting sketch was\r\nvery similar to the picture used as an example. A drawing obtained in\r\nthis way could have no value as evidence.]\r\n\r\n_Charge 7c._ The sergeants failed to ask enough questions about the\r\nmotions of the object. [Incorrect. The standard form for reporting\r\nunidentified flying objects contains questions specifically designed to\r\ndescribe the motion of an unknown; all these questions were asked and\r\nanswered.]\r\n\r\n_Charge 7d._ They used only the standard report form; it did not\r\ninclude questions that allowed Mrs. Fitzgerald to express all her\r\nideas of what she had seen. [Correct. The questions are designed to\r\nelicit observed physical facts; it does not require all the witness’s\r\ninterpretations.]\r\n\r\n_Charge 7e._ They did not take notes during the interview. [Correct.\r\nIn filling out the report form they obtained all the necessary\r\ninformation. They had been trained not to take additional notes because\r\nsome witnesses become nervous when they see that their remarks are\r\nbeing written down.]\r\n\r\n_Basic charge 7._ These “omissions” in procedure proved that the\r\nsergeants had little intention of making an honest investigation.\r\n[Incorrect. They omitted no query that might have yielded useful\r\nevidence. Their duty was to report and try to account for the\r\nphenomenon observed by Mrs. Fitzgerald, not to record her belief in a\r\nhypothetical spaceship. The details of structure and motion that Mr.\r\nC wanted to insert in the record were mere impressions based on his\r\nassumption that the UFO was a solid object under intelligent control.]\r\n\r\nThe document repeatedly charged that the investigators asked too\r\nfew questions, and implied that they asked only five of Mrs.\r\nFitzgerald--yet she answered all the many questions in the standard\r\nreport form. Furthermore, Mr. C had no way of knowing just how many and\r\nwhat questions were asked; during all the latter part of the interview\r\nhe was outside the house.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best comment on the Fitzgerald Report and on the activities\r\nof civilian saucer-investigation groups in general is that of Dr.\r\nThornton Page, the eminent astronomer who in 1952 served on the\r\nscientific panel to evaluate UFO reports (see _Chapter_ VII). After\r\nreceiving a copy of the Fitzgerald Report, he wrote to a member of the\r\nAkron Committee:\r\n\r\n“As a scientist I am interested in unexplained phenomena, but the\r\none or ones responsible for Mrs. Fitzgerald’s sighting is or are\r\nundoubtedly highly complex. It is just as false to say simply that\r\nshe saw a flying saucer 20 feet in diameter as it is to say that she\r\nsaw nothing, or that she simply saw the train headlight on a mist.\r\nCertainly, I would not expect a pair of Air Force investigators to\r\nbe able to explain her sighting (and the others) satisfactorily from\r\ninterviews two weeks after the event. It would be ridiculous to\r\npropose that a team of experts in the fields of physics, psychology,\r\nmeteorology, engineering and railroading be sent to Sheffield Lake,\r\nOhio, to study these sightings from all possible angles.\r\n\r\n“I have already written to you and to others that your fundamental\r\nerror is in oversimplifying your explanations of complex natural\r\nphenomena by assuming a common cause without justification. If you\r\nsay that everything you cannot understand is caused by gremlins, then\r\ngremlins are everywhere! And the Air Force would need a much larger\r\nbudget to investigate every sighting or hearing or feeling of a gremlin!\r\n\r\n“... The onus is not on the Air Force or me to prove that no flying\r\nsaucer was present that night; the onus is on you and your UFO Research\r\nCommittee to prove that there is _no_ other explanation of what was\r\nseen and heard.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Open Mind_\r\n\r\nOf the many astronomical observatories in the United States and\r\nabroad, none has ever photographed an object that remotely resembled\r\na spaceship. Since 1957, hundreds of members of Moonwatch teams\r\nthroughout the world have watched the skies to record passages of the\r\nmany artificial satellites, but no Moonwatch team has yet reported the\r\npresence of a spaceship. Radar stations on all continents keep track\r\nof every artificial satellite and fragment of satellite orbiting the\r\nearth. In February 1963 there were 284 such objects, originating in\r\nCanada, Great Britain, Russia, and the United States. If an interloper\r\nfrom beyond our planet should join the parade, Space Track stations\r\nwould at once detect its presence.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force has found no evidence of any kind that anyone has ever\r\nseen, heard, smelled, photographed, touched, or in any way detected a\r\ntrace of an interplanetary spacecraft. Extraterrestrial visitors have\r\nnot yet arrived, and may never arrive. If and when they do, our Air\r\nForce wants to be the first to know.\r\n\r\nThe Air Force will continue to investigate reports of unidentified\r\nflying objects and to treat them as “serious business.”[XIII-14] The\r\nsecurity of the nation depends on this watchfulness. When a pilot\r\nsees a bright object flashing through the sky and cannot immediately\r\nrecognize it, he knows that he may be looking at a meteor, a balloon,\r\na bird, a sundog, a planetary mirage, or another plane. On the other\r\nhand, since he may be catching a significant glimpse of a guided\r\nmissile or an aircraft from beyond the United States, he promptly\r\nreports another UFO. The Air Force cannot afford to guess what is in\r\nour skies. They want to _know_.\r\n\r\nThe creative scientist, eternally curious, keeps an open mind toward\r\nstrange phenomena and novel ideas, knowing that we have only begun to\r\nunderstand the universe we live in. He remembers, too, that Biot’s\r\ndiscovery that meteorites were “stones from the sky” was at first\r\ngreeted with disbelief, and he hopes never to be guilty of similar\r\nobtuseness. But an open mind does not mean credulity or a suspension of\r\nthe logical faculties that are man’s most valuable asset.\r\n\r\nHuman beings now stand on the threshold of space. Visits to and from\r\nother worlds may occur in the future, bringing new facts and new\r\ninterpretations of reality that we cannot now imagine. No evidence yet\r\nfound indicates that such visits have begun. No fact so far determined\r\nsuggests that a single unidentified flying object has originated\r\noutside our own planet.\r\n\r\n[XIII-1] Keyhoe, D.

In this eBook, each photograph has its own caption.\r\n\r\nThis book uses endnotes following each chapter. In the original book,\r\nthe endnote numbers began at “1” for each chapter. In this eBook, those\r\nnumbers are retained, but are preceded by the chapter number and a\r\nhyphen to make them unique.\r\n\r\nA few endnotes include an “a” suffix.\r\n\r\nMany references to endnotes that reference another book are followed by\r\na pair of square brackets containing the page number in that other book.\r\n\r\nThe book also has four footnotes that originally were at the bottoms of\r\npages, but have been moved here to follow the paragraphs that reference\r\nthem. They use simple “abcd” references.\r\n\r\nThe superscript on page 194 is shown as ^{33} and the subscripts in\r\nFigure 8 are shown as _{1} or _{2}.\r\n\r\nThree endnotes are unreferenced (XII-14, XIII-2 and XIII-6); several\r\nare referenced more than once.\r\n\r\nThe index was not systematically checked for proper alphabetization or\r\ncorrect page references.",
