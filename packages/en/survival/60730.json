DODGE, JR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nDarling State Park, located in northeastern Vermont (see map, “Burke\r\nMountain,” Fig. 1), offers outstanding opportunities to the camper,\r\npicnicker, hiker, view-seeker and winter sportsman. On a clear day the\r\ntop of Burke Mountain offers a most spectacular view of northeastern\r\nVermont and such distant points as Mount Ascutney (located on the\r\nConnecticut River, some 80 miles as the crow flies, to the south). Other\r\nprominent peaks that may be seen are Camels Hump (50 miles southwest),\r\nMount Mansfield (44 miles west), Jay Peak (39 miles northwest), and\r\nMount Washington (the highest Peak in the New England States and the\r\nnortheast, which is located in New Hampshire some 47 miles southeast of\r\nBurke Mountain). For the traveler, the view from Burke Mountain reveals\r\n“where he has been” and where he might “next go.” See Figure 1 for the\r\nlocation of points which can be seen from the overlooks atop Burke\r\nMountain.\r\n\r\nBoth the professional and amateur naturalist will find Darling State\r\nPark extremely interesting. This pamphlet is devoted primarily to the\r\ngeology of the park, but the fauna and flora of this area present the\r\nvisitor with days of interesting studies. It is hoped that in the near\r\nfuture pamphlets describing these aspects of Darling State Park will be\r\npublished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE GEOLOGY OF THE PARK\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore discussing the more detailed aspects of the geology of Darling\r\nState Park, certain basic geologic concepts must be explained. But, even\r\nbefore such a discussion, it might be best to clarify the position of\r\ngeology among the many other, and oftentimes interrelated, sciences.\r\n\r\nThe basic reason for the science of geology might be said to be twofold;\r\none is economic, the other related to Man’s basic curiosity. In the\r\nfirst, the geologist through the use of his knowledge of the earth’s\r\nrocks, locates those indispensable minerals and fuels without which our\r\nadvanced society and technology could not exist. In the second, the\r\ngeologist tries to unlock the many mysteries within the earth’s crust\r\nmerely to satisfy a thirst for knowledge and to pass such knowledge on\r\nto his fellow man. These two basic reasons complement each other and\r\nallow continued advancements in geology, both as a pure science and as a\r\nprimary economic aid to the nation.\r\n\r\nAs found in most spheres of present-day scientific endeavor, the\r\ngeologist relies heavily on other related sciences for insight into\r\nproblems at hand. A basic knowledge, and oftentimes an advanced\r\nknowledge, of physics, chemistry, mathematics and zoology, to name only\r\nsome, are needed before the geologist can approach many of his own\r\nproblems. It might be obvious to you by now, but a geologist will be\r\ncertainly included in the first scientific party to journey to the moon\r\nand planets.\r\n\r\nWithin the general science of geology are several branches, to name only\r\na few; paleontology, sedimentology, mineralogy, petrology, stratigraphy,\r\npetroleum geology, and structural geology. Each of these branches or\r\nspecialty-areas contributes basic data for the overall interpretation of\r\nthe past geologic history of any given geographic area. The historical\r\ngeologist takes all these clues and attempts to fit the pieces of\r\ninformation together into a picture of past events.\r\n\r\nThe concept of Geologic Time must be understood before the history of\r\nDarling State Park can be unraveled. Usually we think of time in terms\r\nof minutes, hours, days, weeks, months and years. The geologist thinks\r\nand talks in terms of millions or even billions of years. Time units as\r\nshort as hundreds of years are impossible to distinguish in the past\r\nhistory of the Earth. When it is realized that the earth is probably 4\r\nto 6 billion (4,000 to 6,000 million) years old, and the record of these\r\nyears is incomplete, it is easy to understand why the geologist speaks\r\nin terms of millions of years instead of years. With modern methods of\r\nradioactive dating the geologist hopes for finer time definitions in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nIn short then, the geologist interprets and puts order into millions of\r\nyears of history which can only be “read” as recorded in the rocks\r\nbeneath our very feet. Of course, just looking at the rocks does not\r\nmagically open the book of geologic history. This pamphlet is designed\r\nto sharpen your powers of observation and to help you in your\r\ninterpretation of these observations.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 2. Thin-section of granite from Burke\r\n    Mountain. The main minerals seen in this photograph are feldspar\r\n    (light gray center right, marked with “F”); quartz (whitish, marked\r\n    with “Q”); biotite (light gray, speckled appearance, marked with\r\n    “B”). Note the interlocking nature of the minerals which make up\r\n    this rock. Magnified 15 times, under crossed nicols.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE ROCKS AND THEIR HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous rock found in the park is _granite_.[1] Along the\r\nroad which winds to the summit of Burke Mountain you will see several\r\noutcrops of the white or pinkish biotite granite (Fig. 4). This granite\r\nis well displayed in the summit parking area and along the trail to the\r\nobservation tower (Figs. 3 and 5). A walk down the Bear Den Ski Trail\r\nalso shows an abundance of granite outcrops (Figs. 6, 7, and 8).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 3. Speckled granite with inclusion of\r\n    metamorphic rock. Black specks in granite are flakes of black\r\n    biotite mica. Metamorphic inclusion, located just above the hammer\r\n    head shows some reaction with the invading granite. Pieces of\r\n    metamorphic rock were undermined by and dropped into the granite as\r\n    it worked its way upward into these rocks. Picture taken a few yards\r\n    west of the tower on top of Burke Mt.]\r\n\r\nWhile looking at some of the above-mentioned photographs, a second\r\nfamily of rocks is discovered (Figs. 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8; also, Figs. 9,\r\n10, 11, and 16). In many places these rocks have a layered or banded\r\nappearance and in other places large lath-like crystals are common in\r\nsome of the layers. In some areas these rocks are very heterogeneous in\r\nappearance and display distorted layers and profuse development of\r\nlath-like crystals (Figs. 12 and 13). These rocks belong to the second\r\nmajor family of rocks, the _Metamorphic_ rocks. The metamorphic rocks[2]\r\nseen in the park were originally _sedimentary_[3] rocks. These rocks\r\nbelong to the Gile Mountain _Formation_[4] which was deposited during\r\nthe _Devonian Period_ some 300 million years ago (see Geologic Time\r\nScale[5], Fig. 14). So much for the two major families of rocks present\r\nin the park, the igneous and metamorphic rocks, and how to distinguish\r\none from the other. Let us assume that you can now distinguish between\r\nthe granite and the metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 4. Outcrop of biotite granite located on the\r\n    summit road between the second and third turns from the summit of\r\n    Burke Mountain and on the right side of the road if descending. Note\r\n    the “sheeting structure” or flat joint surface which slopes or dips\r\n    into the road. This flat break in the rock was probably caused by\r\n    the release in pressure of the overlying glacial ice when it melted\r\n    from this region.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 5. East side of parking area, summit of Burke\r\n    Mountain. Outcrop of granite with many metamorphic rock inclusions\r\n    (hammer, center of picture, rests on large inclusion). Layering or\r\n    banding in the inclusions is almost vertical.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 6. Outcrop located about midway down the Bear\r\n    Den Ski Trail. Alternating metamorphic quartzite and phyllite\r\n    invaded by lighter colored and speckled biotite granite. Note how\r\n    the granite cross-cuts the layered or banded metamorphic rocks. This\r\n    cross-cutting points out the fact that the layering or banding was\r\n    present prior to the invasion of the granite.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 7. Outcrop located about midway down the Bear\r\n    Den Ski Trail. Metamorphic quartzite and phyllite (darker color) and\r\n    invading biotite granite (light speckled appearance). Here the\r\n    granite has a more or less conformable relationship to the layers or\r\n    bands in the metamorphic rock. Compare this relationship with the\r\n    cross-cutting relationship in Fig. 6. For scale, the handle of the\r\n    geologic hammer or pick is about 12 inches long.]\r\n\r\nNow, what is the relationship of one to the other? That is, where you\r\ncan see both of these rock types exposed together in one outcrop, can\r\nyou describe the physical contact of one with the other? For instance,\r\nlook at Figure 6, which was taken about midway down the Bear Den Trail,\r\nhere you see the granite (the white speckled igneous rock which cuts\r\nhorizontally across the picture) cutting across the distinctly layered\r\nor banded metamorphic rocks. The granite is said to have a cross-cutting\r\nrelationship to the metamorphic rocks. In some outcrops the granite is\r\nmore or less parallel to the layers of metamorphic rock (Fig. 7). Here,\r\nthe granite is said to have a conformable relationship with the\r\nmetamorphic rocks. Still another relationship between the granite and\r\nthe metamorphic rock is seen in Figure 8. Here, blocks of metamorphic\r\nrocks are inclosed by granite. These inclosed blocks are called\r\ninclusions and are pieces of invaded rock which fell into or were\r\nencircled by the invading granite.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 8. Inclusion of layered or banded metamorphic\r\n    rock (hammer is resting on this inclusion) in lighter colored\r\n    biotite granite as seen along the Bear Den Ski Trail. The\r\n    metamorphic rocks were invaded and undermined by the granitic rocks,\r\n    with the result that pieces of the metamorphic rock were surrounded\r\n    by granite. For scale, the handle of the geologic hammer or pick is\r\n    about 12 inches long.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 9. Picture taken along the Burke Mountain\r\n    summit road of typical Gile Mountain metamorphic rock. Here the\r\n    rocks dip almost vertically. For those more advanced in geology,\r\n    note the pillow-like segments or boudinage structure about one foot\r\n    to the left of the chisel point of the hammer. This structure is due\r\n    to a stretching of the rock. For scale, the hammer handle is about\r\n    12 inches long.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 10. Banded or layered metamorphic rocks with\r\n    inter-squeezed granite (lighter colored material). This outcrop is\r\n    located on east side of the Bear Den Ski Trail and quite close to\r\n    the Burke Mountain summit road. The hammer handle, center of\r\n    picture, is about one foot long.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 11. Picture taken only a few yards from the\r\n    Burke Mountain observation tower, along the path to the summit\r\n    parking lot, looking northwest. Here you see metamorphic rocks\r\n    (quartzite and phyllite) with some inter-squeezed granite. Note how\r\n    the nearly vertical metamorphic rock layers bend or “wrap-around” to\r\n    the right. The highly resistant inter-squeezed granite actually\r\n    holds Burke Mountain up, or to be more scientific, it prevents these\r\n    rocks from being worn down as fast as the surrounding rocks. For\r\n    scale, see the clip board in the center of the picture.]\r\n\r\nFrom these relationships, what can be said about the relative ages of\r\nthe two rock types? Which is the older, or first formed? Which is the\r\nlast formed? If you study the above relationships for a minute or so, it\r\nwill become obvious that the layered rock had to be formed _prior_ to\r\nthe emplacement of the granite. Some of the minerals now seen in the\r\nlayered or banded metamorphic rocks were formed at the time of granite\r\nintrusion, but the basic “stuff” or partially metamorphosed sedimentary\r\nrock was present before the granite entered the area from beneath. So,\r\nthe knowledge of the two rock types present and an understanding of\r\ntheir relationship to one another tells us a story of at least two\r\nevents which occurred in the park area hundreds of millions of years\r\nago.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 12. Outcrop on south Lookout, summit of Burke\r\n    Mountain. Distorted layers of Gile Mountain metamorphic rock.\r\n    Lath-like crystals developed along some of these layers during the\r\n    second period of metamorphism, that is, when the granite invaded the\r\n    metamorphic rocks. For scale, the hammer handle is about one foot\r\n    long.]\r\n\r\nCan we find other facts in these rocks which might add to the\r\nabove-mentioned events? The answer to this question is, yes! The types\r\nof minerals found in the metamorphic rocks coupled with the inherited\r\nlayered structure so common in these rocks, tells us that they were once\r\nsedimentary rocks. There is other evidence which indicates that these\r\nsedimentary rocks were slightly metamorphosed and folded prior to the\r\ninvasion of the granite. Added information indicates that these same\r\nrocks were subjected to increasing temperatures with the invasion of the\r\ngranite and another metamorphic mineral change took place. Thus far, the\r\nrocks have told us about four distinct events; the deposition and\r\nhardening of the Gile Mountain Formation of sedimentary rocks, the first\r\nperiod of wide-spread metamorphism, accompanied by broad folding, the\r\ninvasion of the granite, and a second phase of metamorphism with the\r\nincreased temperatures produced by this invasion (see cross-sections\r\nillustrating the geologic history of the park area, Fig. 17).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 13. Photograph of the outcrop beneath the\r\n    observation tower, summit of Burke Mountain. Note the heterogeneous\r\n    appearance of the granite-infiltrated metamorphic rock. Here the\r\n    metamorphic rock approaches granite itself in composition and if the\r\n    process had progressed a bit more, it would be said to be granitized\r\n    rock. Large lath-like crystals are very prominent in the rocks of\r\n    this outcrop.]\r\n\r\nThe four events which are mentioned in the preceding paragraph took\r\nplace hundreds of millions of years ago. What has happened in the park\r\nsince these events? Take a look at Figure 15, which was taken along the\r\nroad to the summit of Burke Mountain (coming down from the summit, this\r\noutcrop is located on your right, midway between the second and third\r\nturns in the road). Here the granite exhibits linear scratches or\r\nstriations which trend about 40 degrees east of south (general direction\r\nin which the hammer handle points). Again, just down the road from the\r\nmidway picnic and camping area, and on your right, striations can be\r\nseen. Here they trend about 45 degrees east of south or approximately in\r\nthe same direction as the first series of striations mentioned. These\r\nscratches or striations occur in many places throughout the park, and in\r\nmost cases their orientation is about the same. What caused these\r\nnumerous striations?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 14. Geologic Time Scale. The main Darling\r\n    State Park geologic events are noted on the right, opposite the\r\n    approximate geologic time when each occurred.]\r\n\r\n    ERAS    PERIODS—YEARS AGO          DARLING STATE PARK EVENTS\r\n                   EPOCHS\r\n\r\n CENOZOIC  CENOZOIC             GLACIAL STRIATIONS—“SHEETING STRUCTURE”\r\n             Pleistocene\r\n             Pliocene           EROSION, JOINTING\r\n             Miocene\r\n             Oligocene\r\n             Eocene\r\n             Paleocene\r\n                     70 MILLION\r\n MESOZOIC  CRETACEOUS\r\n           JURASSIC\r\n           TRIASSIC\r\n                    200 MILLION\r\n PALEOZOIC PERMIAN\r\n           PENNSYLVANIAN\r\n           MISSISSIPPIAN        EROSION, JOINTING\r\n                                Invasion of Granite with second stage\r\n                                of metamorphism.\r\n           DEVONIAN             Regional folding and first episode of\r\n                                metamorphism.\r\n           SILURIAN\r\n                                Deposition of the Gile Mountain\r\n                                Formation.\r\n                    360 MILLION\r\n                                NO RECORD IN PARK\r\n           ORDOVICIAN\r\n           CAMBRIAN\r\n                    550 MILLION\r\n PRECAMBRIAN TIME——ORIGIN OF EARTH, 4 TO 5 BILLION YEARS AGO.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 15. Glacial striations or scratches on outcrop\r\n    midway between the second and third turns in the road down from the\r\n    summit area of Burke Mountain. Striations trend about 40 degrees\r\n    east of south or in approximately the same direction that the hammer\r\n    handle is pointing. Hammer handle is about one foot long.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 16. Midway between the second and third turns,\r\n    descending on the Burke Mountain summit road. Metamorphic quartzite\r\n    and phyllite showing at least two prominent joints. Layers are\r\n    vertical and parallel to the front joint (one which hammer handle\r\n    touches). For the more advanced student of geology, note the\r\n    lineations parallel to the hammer handle and on the front surface.\r\n    For scale, hammer handle is about one foot long.]\r\n\r\nSince they are still preserved in the rocks for us to see, they must\r\nhave been formed quite recently, that is, geologically speaking. What\r\ncan explain these striations and their common orientation? Did you ever\r\nhear about the Great Ice Age, or the Pleistocene Epoch? Less than one\r\nmillion years ago, in fact, some 12,000 years ago, an ice sheet many\r\nthousands of feet thick rode over Burke Mountain in a southeastward\r\ndirection. The many boulders frozen to the underside of the ice sheet\r\ntended to scratch the rocks over which they rode. The scratches or\r\nstriations seen in the park rocks were caused by these attached\r\nboulders. The ice sheet also plucked and rounded Burke Mountain into the\r\nshape it possesses today.\r\n\r\nA look at Figure 4 shows still another event which occurred during\r\nrecent geological time. The prominent smooth fracture-surface seen to\r\nslope or dip toward the road is called “sheeting structure” which has\r\nits origin in post-glacial time. It is thought by many geologists that\r\nthese flat surfaces or _joints_[6], which are generally parallel to the\r\nground surface, were formed with the release of the weight of the\r\noverlying glacial ice when the glacier retreated northward. So, here we\r\nhave evidence displayed in the rocks which tells of still another event\r\nin the park’s history. It should be mentioned here, while still on the\r\nsubject of joints, that other joints do occur in the park rocks. Figure\r\n16 shows joints which were formed earlier than the “sheeting” and which\r\nare not parallel to the surface of the ground. These joints were\r\nprobably formed as a result of the removal of the overlying rocks\r\nthrough erosion, thus releasing long-continued pressures produced by the\r\nweight of the overlying rocks, and movement of the earth’s crust. We now\r\nhave the story of two main episodes in the park’s geological history;\r\none took place many millions of years ago, the other within the last\r\n12,000 years. What happened between these two rock-documented episodes?\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 17. Geologic cross-sections illustrating the\r\n    geologic history of Darling State park. (For explanation of\r\n    cross-sections see top of page 19.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Deposition and hardening of the Gile Mountain Formation. At this\r\n      stage the layers of rock were more or less horizontal.\r\n\r\n2. The horizontal and parallel layers of the Gile Mountain Formation\r\n      were gently and broadly folded and regionally metamorphosed. This\r\n      is the first stage of metamorphism in the park area.\r\n\r\n3. Invasion by granite. This invasion was accompanied by local\r\n      metamorphism of the invaded rocks. This is the second stage of\r\n      metamorphism in the park area. Note the inclusions of first stage\r\n      metamorphosed Gile Mountain rocks in the granite.\r\n\r\n4. Many millions of years of erosion took place, the forces of nature\r\n      finally exposing the granitic rocks at the surface of the earth.\r\n\r\n5. Continued erosion caused the metamorphically reenforced Gile Mountain\r\n      rocks to wear down more slowly than the surrounding weaker rocks.\r\n      For this reason, these strengthened rocks stand higher than the\r\n      weaker rocks.\r\n\r\n6. Less than one million years ago the glaciers advanced over the park\r\n      area. The glacial ice plucked and scratched (striated) the\r\n      underlying rocks as it slowly advanced southward. During the\r\n      retreat (northward) certain deposits were left. Present-day Burke\r\n      Mountain is much the same as it was when the glaciers left, but,\r\n      some added erosion has taken place and, because of uplift, the\r\n      Mountain stands a bit higher than it did some 10,000 years ago.\r\n      Some soil, much of which was removed by the glaciers, has since\r\n      formed on the mountain.\r\n\r\nThere are no rocks present in the park which were deposited during this\r\ninterval of time, therefore, no rock record. If no rocks representing\r\nthis time interval are present, one of two reasons must be responsible.\r\nEither the park area was undergoing active erosion (wearing down) during\r\nthis period, or sediments were deposited during part or all of this time\r\ninterval and subsequently completely removed by erosion. Most probably,\r\nthe intervening time found the park area above the depositional\r\nenvironment of the sea, when its rocks were being worn away by the\r\nerosional forces of nature. Again, see Figure 17 for a diagrammatic\r\nrepresentation of the geologic history of the park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     WHY IS THERE A BURKE MOUNTAIN?\r\n\r\n\r\nGranite is a very resistant rock, that is, it wears away very slowly\r\nunder the forces of nature. The granite is worn down more slowly than\r\nthe metamorphic rocks which it has intruded. The granite has been\r\nsqueezed between and across the layers (bands) of the metamorphic rocks\r\n(previously sedimentary rocks) now found on Burke Mountain. In a very\r\ntrue sense, the granite forms a skeleton framework for the metamorphic\r\nrocks of Burke Mountain. In other words, it holds these metamorphic\r\nrocks up above the surrounding area of metamorphic rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             HIKES TO TAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nA very interesting hike, both geologically and for nature hunting in\r\ngeneral, is the old fire road which begins just above the old C.C.C.\r\ncamp and the present Bell Gardens. This trail cuts off to the right, if\r\nascending the summit road, and runs completely around the mountain.\r\nShortly after the fire trail intersects the Bear Den Ski Trail, and on\r\nthe left, granite with obvious drill holes is seen (Fig. 18). Most of\r\nthe granite used as curb stones, culvert headers, and islands along the\r\npark summit road was obtained from these small quarries. A few miles\r\nwalk along this trail proves quite rewarding to the adventurer; an old\r\nlean-to demonstrates what a bear can do while sharpening his claws.\r\n\r\nThe Devil’s Den Trail leads down the east side of Burke Mountain from\r\nthe observation tower at the summit. This trail is rather poorly marked\r\npast a certain point, but if you wish to strike off on your own and see\r\nsome wonderful country, a hike down this trail with a swing to the north\r\nwill bring you back to the summit road.\r\n\r\nThe several ski trails on Burke Mountain are all walkable during the\r\nsummer, but they will not appear as smooth as when covered with snow,\r\nand the trip down will take considerably longer on foot than on\r\n“boards.” The Bear Den Ski Trail is especially good for geological\r\nsightseeing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         NEARBY AREAS TO VISIT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile at Darling State Park a visit to Lake Willoughby is well worth the\r\ntrip (Figs. 19, 20). A glance at Figure 1 will show you its general\r\nlocation. Once you visit this lake, you might ask “why so beautiful a\r\nLake Willoughby?” There is still some question as to the origin of the\r\nlake basin, but a combination of oriented joints and recent glacial\r\nmovement seems to fit the picture. Deeper and faster weathering along\r\nparallel joints together with glacial movement and scour in the same\r\ndirection as the joints probably dug the elongated trench which, when\r\nfilled with water, became Lake Willoughby.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this pamphlet has given you the desire to enlarge your\r\nknowledge of the science of geology. Geology is all around you wherever\r\nyou might travel and a knowledge of geology will open new roads even\r\nwhile traveling old ones. Here’s luck to you in your travels; try to\r\n_see_ what you look at.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 18.

This is a comprehensive\r\n      study of the Burke Mountain area and a must for those interested\r\n      in Darling State Park.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               Footnotes\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]The granite found in Darling State Park is white or pinkish in color\r\n    and most times is speckled with shiny black mica flakes. On close\r\n    inspection, grains of smoky to clear color are seen within the rock.\r\n    The white and pink grains are the mineral, feldspar; the shiny black\r\n    flakes, biotite mica; the smoky to clear grains, quartz or silica. A\r\n    magnified picture of a slice of granite (see Fig. 2) shows the\r\n    individual mineral grains and their interlocking nature with each\r\n    other. Granite belongs to a major family of rocks, termed _Igneous\r\n    rocks_. Igneous rocks are formed through the hardening or\r\n    lithification of molten rock-material when subjected to the cooler\r\n    temperatures at or near the earth’s surface. The molten rock\r\n    material formed at some depth beneath the surface of the earth,\r\n    where temperatures were many hundreds of degrees hotter than at the\r\n    surface.\r\n\r\n[2]Metamorphic rocks are either sedimentary (this, a third major family\r\n    of rocks which is characterized by a layered appearance that has\r\n    been retained by many of the altered park rocks) or igneous rocks\r\n    (the granite) which have been under the influence of pressure, heat,\r\n    and chemically active fluids, oftentimes resulting in chemical and\r\n    structural changes. Most of the metamorphic rocks seen in the park\r\n    are either schist, phyllite, slate or quartzite. For the benefit of\r\n    the more advanced student, the rocks of the park area are considered\r\n    a granite-hornfels complex (see Bertram G. Woodland’s paper of 1963,\r\n    “A Petrographic study of Thermally Metamorphosed Pelitic rocks in\r\n    the Burke Area, Northeastern Vermont,” in the American Journal of\r\n    Science, volume 261, pages 354 to 375).\r\n\r\n[3]Sedimentary or layered rocks, the third major rock family, are\r\n    composed of pieces, grains and other materials from older\r\n    metamorphic, igneous and sedimentary rocks. These fragments have\r\n    been carried by rivers and streams to some resting place at the\r\n    bottom of a sea, lake, or stream channel. This mud, sand and gravel,\r\n    under the weight of steadily increasing overburden, and the presence\r\n    of cementing materials, slowly hardened into rock which we now call\r\n    limestone shale, sandstone, and conglomerate.\r\n\r\n[4]A geologic formation consists of a sequence of rock layers which were\r\n    deposited under essentially the same conditions, or a series of\r\n    alternating conditions, and which can be easily distinguished and\r\n    mapped as a unit by geologists in the field.\r\n\r\n[5]Geologic time is divided into four Eras which are designated from\r\n    oldest to youngest: Precambrian, Paleozoic, Mesozoic, and Cenozoic.\r\n    Each of these Eras is divided into geologic periods of time. The\r\n    Devonian Period is in about the middle of the Paleozoic Era and\r\n    began some 330 million years ago and ended approximately 290 million\r\n    years ago (see Geologic Time Scale, Fig. 14).\r\n\r\n[6]A joint is a break in a rock mass which interrupts its physical\r\n    continuity. A group of more or less parallel joints is known as a\r\n    joint set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
