There is no finer tribute to the\r\nequability and general excellence of the climate of southern California\r\nthan that given in the history of aëronautics. It was here, in 1900,\r\nthat Chanute completed his early and epoch-making observations of the\r\nflight of gulls and pelicans. These contributed largely to the success\r\nof the Wright brothers a few years afterward. It was in southern\r\nCalifornia, six years ago, that Harkness, in an Antoinette, made his\r\nrecord monoplane flight to Tia Juana. San Diego witnessed the flying\r\nof the first seaplane, by Curtiss, five years ago. It is in this\r\ndistrict that not only the War Department aviation school and a number\r\nof commercial flying schools are located, but also one of the large\r\nairplane[B] factories in this country.\r\n\r\n    [B] The National Advisory Committee for Aëronautics in\r\n        its report of October 17, 1916, on Nomenclature for\r\n        Aëronautics, the name _airplane_ is substituted for “Any\r\n        form of aircraft heavier than air which has wing surfaces\r\n        for sustention, with stabilizing surfaces, rudders for\r\n        steering, and power-plant for propulsion through the air.”\r\n\r\n_Location of the School._--Whatever the final action may be as to\r\npermanent location, it has been conceded by all authorities that\r\nthe situation of the aviation school on North Island, San Diego Bay,\r\nis ideal. (See Fig. 21.) The so-called island is connected with the\r\npeninsula of Coronado by a narrow sand-spit, and it comprises many\r\nhundred acres of level land free from buildings and any sort of\r\noverhead wires. The island fronts the ocean on the south; Point Loma on\r\nthe west with the narrow entrance to the bay between; to the north is\r\nthe city of San Diego across the bay; and Coronado just beyond Spanish\r\nBight on the east. This natural arrangement gives good air conditions\r\nfor beginners, and also enables them to use the smooth waters of the\r\nbay as well as the rough ocean water for the seaplanes. The proximity\r\nof this location to San Diego is also a distinct advantage. (See Fig.\r\n11.) All of the structures of the aviation school on North Island are\r\ntemporary, the buildings consisting of a scattering array of huge sheds.\r\n\r\n_Character of Instruction._--Officers from all branches of the army\r\nvolunteer for this service. The qualifications of an aviator are\r\ncaution, judgment, and technical skill. Deficiencies in caution and\r\njudgment being temperamental are rarely remedied, while technical\r\nskill is largely a matter of acquirement. Less than ninety days are\r\nallowed for qualification as a junior aviator, and if in that period\r\nthe officer’s deficiencies are found to be inherent, he returns to his\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nThe school is a place for hard work and quick thinking. Detail in the\r\nrepair shop is part of the course, as is also the use of the gasoline\r\nengine in motor trucks as well as in aircraft. (See Fig. 22.) Theory\r\nand practice are closely united: the former is carried on by means\r\nof bi-daily lectures, while the early morning hours are devoted to\r\nflying. Pilot-and-observer machines equipped with double control are\r\nused in instruction. The aviation instructor ascends with the student\r\nand allows him to manipulate the controls, only resuming the management\r\nof the airplane in an emergency. Needless to say, the life of an\r\ninstructor is a most hazardous one and full of thrills. His duty is to\r\nbe on the alert to correct errors in the manipulation of the machine.\r\nAfter every trip the instructor reviews, point by point, the features\r\nof the flight, showing the pupil his deficiencies and explaining how\r\nhe may avoid them in the future. The instruction is terse but kindly,\r\nand the manner of imparting this information leaves nothing to the\r\nimagination. After watching student and instructor, and closely\r\nstudying the finished work of an aviator, it is my opinion that in no\r\nother occupation must there be such perfect coördination between mind\r\nand muscle: the perfectly qualified aviator is the modern super-man.[C]\r\n\r\n    [C] The army aviator of today is picked for his quickness of\r\n        mind and body, and the first thing that strikes you about\r\n        him is a sort of feline, wound-up-spring alertness. Then\r\n        you note his reticence, the cool reserve of a man whose\r\n        lot is to express himself in deeds rather than words. And,\r\n        lastly, there is the quiet seriousness, verging almost\r\n        on sadness, of a man who must hold himself ready to look\r\n        death between the eyes at any moment and yet keep his\r\n        mind detached for other things.--Lewis R. Freeman in the\r\n        _Atlantic Monthly_.\r\n\r\n_Results of a Year’s Work._--During the year 1915, the students of the\r\naviation school made 3,652 flights with a total time aloft of 1,516\r\nhours, and a mileage of 95,000. As regards weather conditions affecting\r\nflights, it will be found interesting to note Chart No. 5 giving\r\nnumber of flights and duration for the fourteen months ending August,\r\n1916, which shows that work progressed regardless of weather, and at\r\nan increasing rate.[D] In February, a military tractor-seaplane (an\r\nall-California product), 125-horsepower motor, with twenty-six gallons\r\nof gasoline, four gallons of oil, and three passengers, making a total\r\nweight of 3,100 pounds, reached an altitude of 12,362 feet. This was\r\nthe world’s record, the previous altitude under the same conditions\r\nhaving been 9,000 feet.\r\n\r\n    [D] “It is estimated that the average cost to France of\r\n        training each pilot is five thousand dollars ... no less\r\n        than from four to six months are devoted to the training\r\n        of finished pilots. Although I have just come from France,\r\n        the progress of aviation is so rapid that much of my own\r\n        knowledge may be out of date before I again return to the\r\n        front.”--C. D. Winslow, “With the French Flying Corps,”\r\n        1917, 4–5: N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAPPLIED METEOROLOGY FOR THE AVIATOR\r\n\r\n\r\n_Activities of the Weather Bureau in Relation to\r\nAëronautics._--Naturally the progress of aërial navigation has at all\r\ntimes been rather closely connected with the Weather Bureau. For over\r\na decade the Bureau has not been content with surface observations\r\nbut has maintained laboratories for the study of the upper air. The\r\nresults of its observations are considered a mine of information for\r\nthe student aviator. Prof. Charles F. Marvin, the Chief of the Weather\r\nBureau, is a member of the National Advisory Committee for Aëronautics,\r\nand chairman of a subcommittee engaged on the determination of the\r\nproblems of the atmosphere in relation to aëronautics.[E]\r\n\r\n    [E] Monthly Weather Review, 1915, 32:500. Washington.\r\n\r\nThe first official coöperation between the Weather Bureau and the War\r\nDepartment aviation school was inaugurated in the year 1914 by Dr.\r\nW. J. Humphreys, Professor of Meteorological Physics, when he was\r\ndetailed to give a course of lectures. It was during this course that\r\nhe lectured on “Holes in the Air.”[F] This paper has been reprinted as\r\na textbook for the aviation school.\r\n\r\n    [F] Popular Science Monthly, 1914, 44:18–34, N. Y.\r\n\r\n_Early Studies in Aëronautics._--Unofficially, however, the coöperation\r\nextended back some fifteen years prior to that time, when the writer\r\nwas in charge of the local office of the Weather Bureau at San Diego,\r\nand assisted the aëronautical engineer, Octave Chanute, in his\r\nobservations and experiments on San Diego Bay.[G] At this time hundreds\r\nof photographs of sea-gulls, pelicans, and other soaring birds were\r\nmade, and both birds and photographs studied and analyzed. Ever since\r\nthen more or less interest has been taken by the writer in aërial\r\nnavigation. During an assignment to the Central Office the work of\r\nthe Wright brothers was observed and studied. The association with\r\nthe late Octave Chanute and his friends, the Wrights, during their\r\nexperimental flights at Fort Meyer, Virginia, in September, 1908, is\r\ncounted among the many pleasant memories of the Washington visit. It\r\nwas here that was witnessed the first flight with a passenger (see Fig.\r\n4), Mr. Orville Wright taking up with him Major (now Colonel) George O.\r\nSquier, the present head of the aviation branch of the army. Such was\r\nthe infancy of the flying-machine that at that date no fatalities had\r\noccurred. A few years later the writer had the pleasure of accompanying\r\nMr. Glenn Curtiss while he was determining a site for his school, which\r\nwas finally located on North Island. (See Fig. 6.) Shortly afterward,\r\nfrom this place, Harry Harkness made record amateur cross-country\r\nflights in an Antoinette monoplane.\r\n\r\n    [G] “Climate and Weather of San Diego,” Carpenter, 1913, 57–59,\r\n        San Diego.\r\n\r\n_Active Work of the Weather Bureau._--During the score of years that\r\nthe writer has been in charge of the San Diego and Los Angeles stations\r\nof the Weather Bureau, interest in flying has been cumulative. Efforts\r\nhave been made to furnish aviators with available data so that at the\r\npresent time a day seldom passes without conference With officials or\r\nstudents of Government or private flying schools in this vicinity.\r\n\r\n_Lectures on Meteorology as Applied to Aviation._--Through the War\r\nDepartment, October, 1915, on request of the commanding officer of the\r\nSignal Corps aviation school, at San Diego, the writer was directed by\r\nthe Chief of the Weather Bureau to deliver two lectures of which the\r\nfollowing are outlines:\r\n\r\n\r\n“_What the Weather Bureau Offers the Aviator_”\r\n\r\n(Illustrated by 37 lantern-slides from photographs by the author)\r\n\r\n  Introductory:\r\n    Weather service once part of the Signal Corps, U.S.A.\r\n    Transfer in 1891 to the Department of Agriculture.\r\n\r\n  Distribution of weather stations in the United States:\r\n    Character of data obtainable:\r\n      Advance data from the daily map such as\r\n        Position of high and low areas.\r\n      Weather conditions from sub-stations in vicinity.\r\n\r\n  The weather map:\r\n    How constructed.\r\n    How distributed.\r\n    Specimen maps showing differing conditions in California.\r\n      Winds, velocity and frequency:\r\n        On-shore.\r\n        Off-shore.\r\n      Discussion of air conditions December 20–22, 1914.\r\n    The international weather map.\r\n      Relation to weekly forecasts.\r\n\r\n  Cardinal climatic features:\r\n    Ascending winds and types producing them:\r\n      Cloud, fog, precipitation.\r\n    Descending winds:\r\n      “Northers” and dust-storms.\r\n      Thermograph and hygrograph traces.\r\n\r\n  Factors in the meteorology of southern California:\r\n    Influence of latitude:\r\n      Sea.\r\n      Mountains.\r\n      Desert.\r\n    Path and distribution of storm areas.\r\n    Knowledge of local climatology necessary in flying.\r\n    Local winds discussed:\r\n      “Woollies” (descending wind eddies).\r\n      “Chubascos” (south coast thunder squall).\r\n      “Santa Anas” (northeasterly and desiccating).\r\n      “Wilmingtons” (northwesterly line-squall).\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Practical Meteorology for the Aviator_”\r\n\r\n(Illustrated by 72 lantern-slides from photographs by the author)\r\n\r\n  Historical:\r\n    Original work begun in Scotland, year 1749.\r\n    Characteristics--\r\n      English work; Dines’ minute meteorograph.\r\n      French work; Dr. Berson’s balloon ascent of 6½ miles.\r\n      German work; detailed data in low altitudes.\r\n      American work began with Franklin.\r\n  The Upper Air:\r\n    Definition:\r\n      “Stratosphere” is (according to some authorities) the\r\n        dynamical laboratory of the atmosphere where the\r\n        main causes of pressure originate.\r\n    Results in America:\r\n      Balloon meteorograph (Fig. 3).\r\n      Charts showing rate of increase in wind velocity with\r\n        elevation (Chart No. 4).\r\n      Wind, temperature, pressure, humidity at maximum airplane\r\n        height of 26,242 feet.\r\n      Stratosphere:\r\n        Lower level in winter than in summer.\r\n        Lower temperature in summer when surface pressure is\r\n          high.\r\n    Definition:\r\n      “Troposphere” is the physical laboratory where cloud\r\n        and rain are produced by local causes and induced\r\n        by the effect of the dynamical changes in the upper air.\r\n      Conditions within 6 or 7 miles of the earth’s surface.\r\n  Clouds and their Meaning:\r\n    Cirrus:\r\n      Height and composition.\r\n      Formation:\r\n        Perpendicular shafts of clouds indicate rapid changes\r\n          in weather.\r\n        Horizontal layers, no change and clouds will dissipate.\r\n    Cirro-stratus, threatening in winter.\r\n    Cirro-cumulus, fair and foul varieties differentiated.\r\n    Cumulus with strong uplift.\r\n    Alto-cumulus, cause of parallel rows.\r\n    Fracto-cumulus, wind indicator, Point Loma “woolly.”\r\n    Stratus.\r\n    Alto-stratus, favorable for flying.\r\n    Strato-cumulus, long shallow rolls, threatening in winter.\r\n    Cumulo-nimbus, unsafe air conditions for flying.\r\n    Fracto-nimbus, waterspouts and their causes.\r\n    Velo cloud, examples, cause, effect, distribution, density.\r\n    Fog, examples of great fog-belts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nNARRATIVE OF WEATHER OBSERVATIONS FROM AN AIRPLANE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to qualify as meteorologist competent to confer with aviators,\r\nit seemed desirable to become personally acquainted with some of\r\nthe conditions that confronted them. As a matter of professional\r\nacquirement therefore, I was glad to accept an invitation to go aloft\r\nafter the necessary official arrangements had been made with Washington.\r\n\r\nThis trip was in line with the previous endeavors of applying practical\r\nmeteorology to the science of flight and appropriately extended the\r\nwork which was begun in San Diego with Chanute and the sea-gulls\r\nfifteen years before.\r\n\r\n_Object of Flight._--I wished to put myself in the student’s place\r\nand learn at first hand the practical facts he demanded from weather\r\nobservations and to acquaint myself with everything possible that might\r\nbe of value to an aviator. There were two definite things of which I\r\ndesired knowledge: first, to determine the height of the upward trend\r\nof the sea-breeze over Point Loma which causes the mysterious “woolly”\r\nof a score of years’ acquaintance from a yachting standpoint; second,\r\nto observe the extent, form, and composition of the velo cloud which is\r\nthe characteristic sun-cover of California.\r\n\r\n_Preparations for the Ascent._--Aviator Instructor Oscar Brindley\r\n(the 1915 winner of the Curtiss trophy), in military tractor No.\r\n50, was assigned as pilot. It may be stated here that the accepted\r\ndefinition of aviator is a pilot of a flying-machine heavier than air.\r\nThe airplane used in my first flight (see Fig. 13) was made in Los\r\nAngeles and is the present standard army model. This tractor has an\r\n80-horsepower engine and 8-foot propeller. It is 21 feet long, has a\r\nwing-spread of 38 feet, supporting area 364 square feet, and a flying\r\nradius, with two persons, of 300 miles. The maximum altitude attained\r\nwith this model at San Diego was 13,000 feet. Before being placed in\r\nservice the machines are thoroughly gone over at the repair shop (see\r\nFig. 22), and the motors are run at full speed for twenty-four hours,\r\nafter which they are taken down and subjected to scrutiny for possible\r\ndefects. All of the struts, guys, and wires are closely examined; the\r\nboltheads are all drilled, wired, and soldered so that no amount of\r\nvibration will loosen them. Regardless of the length of the flight,\r\neach machine, before going up again, is given a rigid inspection and\r\nnot until the mechanicians have tested every part is it pronounced\r\nready.\r\n\r\nNot being prepared with a regulation aviation suit, I was loaned a\r\nleather jacket by one officer, face-goggles and safety helmet by\r\nothers. I then took my place in the observer’s seat forward and was\r\nstrapped into it with the safety belt (see Fig. 12). I was cautioned to\r\nlet my body give way as the waist-controls were moved from side to side\r\nand not pay any attention to the steering rudder wheel which had a way\r\nof mysteriously revolving, advancing and receding.\r\n\r\nIn cranking an airplane, a certain formula is always gone through. The\r\nmechanician at the propeller calls out, “Close!” The aviator closes\r\nthe switch and repeats the word. This short-circuits the ignition\r\napparatus so that no spark occurs in the cylinders. The propeller is\r\nturned in order to introduce explosive mixtures into the cylinders.\r\nWhen ready to start the mechanician says “Open!” The aviator opens the\r\nswitch and repeats the word. The charges in the cylinders then fire\r\nwhen the propeller is turned.\r\n\r\nAfter the engine starts, the machine is “trimmed” by helpers and\r\njockeyed for a favorable “take-off” into the air. (See Figs. 14, 15.)\r\nThis model of airplane climbs on a gradient 1 to 7; its minimum speed\r\nis 41 miles per hour. In other words, if the speed is less than 41\r\nmiles per hour the machine will not fly horizontally.\r\n\r\n_The Ascent._--The tractor was headed into a 30-mile northwesterly\r\nwind so that the “take-off” was quick and easy; there were only a few\r\nseconds spent rolling over the field, when the airplane left the ground\r\nand I felt the never to be forgotten cushioning feeling of the air.\r\nFor ten seconds there was experienced a decidedly weakening nervous\r\nchill, which occurred to me once before when making a high dive from\r\na spring-board. It was the sort of physiological disturbance that can\r\nonly be counteracted by immediately pulling one’s self together saying,\r\n“_Well, here goes nothing!_” The momentary depression was immediately\r\nfollowed by a corresponding elation of feeling which strange to say did\r\nnot leave me during the trip and is always associated with thoughts\r\nof the journey. There was no dizziness, although I am peculiarly\r\nsusceptible to the least change in balance. The earth did not recede\r\nas we progressed steadily upward; we seemed part of the earth, but\r\nnot of it. Although the airplane reached an altitude of 3,000 feet in\r\na comparatively few minutes, the barometer falling from 30.0 to 27.0\r\ninches, the decreased bodily pressure was not at all noticeable.[H]\r\n\r\n    [H] Trans-American Climatic Association, 1915, 31:20, Hot\r\n        Springs, Va.\r\n\r\nNext to the supporting quality of the atmosphere I had noticed the\r\n70-mile blast of air as the airplane pushed its way steadily onward and\r\nupward. Naturally, the exhaust of the motor in addition to the roar of\r\nthe wind made conversation impossible. Some airplanes have telephone\r\ncommunication between observer and pilot. (See Fig. 9.) During one\r\nflight in a machine not so equipped, the passenger noticed the breaking\r\nof some apparatus. Knowing that it was impossible to make himself heard\r\nhe hastily scribbled the word “Accident!” on a bit of card, whereupon\r\nthe pilot shut off his engine and glided to earth.\r\n\r\n_Two-thousand Feet above Point Loma._--Carrying out my suggestion as\r\nto investigating the “woolly,” the pilot drove the machine straight\r\nfor Point Loma and those unseen aërial breakers. Suddenly there were\r\ntwo distinct “wallops” and I felt the fuselage beneath me respond as\r\nif struck by a stuffed club. There was evidently first a surge then\r\na drop, and it was the descending current of air that deprived the\r\nairplane of the supporting medium, hence the shock. Point Loma itself,\r\nfrom this altitude, and seen directly from above, looked very like a\r\nbarracuda’s backbone--long, low, and ugly. Although this peninsula (see\r\nFig. 21) is less than 500 feet high it so effectively deflects the\r\nprevailing northwesterly wind that the upward surge has been noticed by\r\naviators at an altitude of 4,000 feet. It is no wonder then that these\r\ndescending winds, called “woollies” (from their churning the water into\r\nisolated masses which look like tufts of wool), are dreaded alike by\r\nyachtsmen and birdmen. They have been known to carry away topsails from\r\ntoo closely venturing schooners and student aviators always give the\r\nvicinity of Point Loma a wide berth.\r\n\r\n_No Winds Aloft._--We had not changed our direction since leaving the\r\nground, but after passing over Point Loma the airplane was put sharply\r\non a port course. I had been expecting this and must confess, somewhat\r\ndreaded it, innocently thinking that a 30-mile wind added to our\r\n70-mile rate of speed would “heel” the craft to an uncomfortable angle\r\nwhen the course was changed from northwesterly to southerly. What was\r\nmy astonishment to find that the putting about was unaccompanied by\r\nany of the nautical motions such as tilting or canting. Theoretically\r\none may be ever so well grounded in physical laws but it seems to take\r\nactual experience to bring their truth home to us. Of course there can\r\nbe no wind in the air; when we entered the air it was moving 30 miles\r\nan hour in relation to the earth but as soon as we were free from the\r\nearth the velocity of the wind had no effect on our flight. No matter\r\nhow strong the gale, so far as it concerned the airplane, if the wind\r\nbe steady no difficulty is experienced; the aviator is concerned only\r\nby wind-shifts.\r\n\r\n_The Velo Cloud Seen from Above._--In kindergarten days I remember that\r\none of the first questions I asked was “Are clouds smoke?” And this\r\nearly query was really first answered in the air. Fog on a mountain\r\ntop may be cloud, but somehow cloud free from close proximity to the\r\nearth seems different.\r\n\r\nThe machine was put through the cloud blanket much as a horse takes\r\na hurdle; it seemed unlike fog and more of a palpable substance. As\r\nwe emerged, the sun was shining on it like a silvery sea with gently\r\nundulating surfaces and it looked for all the world as supportable\r\nas layers of cotton-wool. Many times have cloud-banks from mountain\r\ntops been observed, yet the upper side of the velo cloud from a\r\nflying-machine looked very different. The cloud was only four or\r\nfive hundred feet thick and extended inland a few miles in irregular\r\noutline. The seaward edges of the velo cloud were not ragged, and\r\napparently paralleled the coast for 10 or 15 miles.\r\n\r\nSuch was the exhilaration and confidence the air gave that I can\r\nunderstand how parachute jumpers confidently step off into space,\r\nfor to them the air is a supporting medium no more terrible than a\r\ntransparent sea to a good swimmer. I believe that the record parachute\r\ndrop was made in 1916 by Colonel Maitland, of the English Royal Flying\r\nCorps, who descended in a parachute 10,000 feet from an airplane.\r\nFifteen minutes was occupied in the descent.\r\n\r\n_Ease of Vision at 3,500 Feet Altitude._--At this altitude the ease of\r\nvision is most remarkable. At this height, _with perpendicular vision_,\r\nthe eye is possessed of wonderful powers. In those “solitudes august\r\nwith stars” men not only “mount up with wings as eagles” but are given\r\nthe eagle’s unobstructed vision. Birds have been credited with much too\r\nkeen vision. From this height of several thousand feet every object\r\nstood out with remarkable distinctness. Automobiles racing along the\r\nEl Cajon boulevard to Lakeside were readily picked up with the unaided\r\neye although 20 miles away. Looking down over the aviation field the\r\nlong compass mark and the wind-direction pennant (Figs. 19 and 20)\r\nwere easily distinguished. The bay and ocean, however, gave the most\r\nremarkable revelation, for the bottom of the bay and the shallow ocean\r\nshore were plainly discernible. The absence of water as well as air\r\nrefraction explains why submarines cannot hide from an airplane: one of\r\nthe army aviators told me that a submarine cannot ordinarily sink so\r\nlow that it cannot be seen from an airplane.\r\n\r\n_Color of Landing-ground Important._--Owing to the absorption and\r\nreflection of sunlight, there is a distinct variation in the character\r\nof otherwise similar landing-ground. A field, dark from recent plowing\r\n(or burning), will heat the air over it faster than will a field of\r\nstubble, hence over the former field there will be the greater air\r\ndisturbance, and this will affect the ease of landing. Air is heated\r\nby contact and convection. One of the aviators said that recently he\r\nwas descending, and had all but reached the ground when a localized\r\nconvectional current hurled his machine upward some distance but\r\nimmediately afterward deposited him on the ground without damage.\r\n\r\n_Spiraling Down 3,000 Feet._--Speeding ever in wide circles the course\r\nlay southeast over the upper part of San Diego Bay. The city of San\r\nDiego presented the usual checkerboard appearance (Fig. 16), and\r\neven at this altitude it would seem easy to drop an orange at almost\r\nany point. The velo cloud was lifting and we could see the gradual\r\ndisappearance as it melted rather than drifted from North Island. (See\r\nFig. 17.)\r\n\r\nThe gliding descent was made from an altitude of 2,500 feet, starting\r\nabove San Diego. As the aviation school was approached, we could see a\r\nnumber of machines in the air, three below and two above us, circling\r\nabout like hawks. And, like soaring birds, these machines had their\r\nair-lanes, designated courses and levels being devoted to the different\r\nclasses of machines. The landing was made without incident and the\r\nhour’s flight was ended.\r\n\r\n_Outline of Meteorological Work at the Aviation School._--At the close\r\nof the lecture detail, the attention of the student aviators was called\r\nto the importance of their having as thorough knowledge as possible of\r\nthe fundamentals of meteorology. The application of these fundamentals\r\nto the analysis of air conditions met with in their daily flights was\r\nshown to be essential. Investigations as to varying wind direction were\r\ntaken up by one of the staff instructors by the use of small parachutes\r\nto be dropped at different altitudes. (See Fig. 8.) Through the\r\ncoöperation of the local official in charge of the San Diego Weather\r\nBureau station, duplicate signal sheets were available from which the\r\nstudent officers made their local weather maps. From these maps and\r\ntheir own flights, they could arrive at some relationship between the\r\nactual and the theoretical 3,000- and 10,000-foot level maps prepared\r\nfrom the Bigelow formula, as used by the Bureau. Lectures were given\r\non temperature and its distribution; winds, moisture, and clouds were\r\nalso made part of the course, one of the papers of the Bureau[I] being\r\nreprinted by the aviation school by permission of the Chief of the\r\nBureau and used as a textbook. The Weather Bureau furnished the station\r\nwith a standard set of meteorological instruments so that the student\r\nofficers could become perfectly familiar with the regular equipment at\r\nthe Weather Bureau stations.\r\n\r\n    [I] “Clouds of California,” Carpenter, 1914, 24, 2d ed., Ft.\r\n        Leavenworth (U. S. Army Press).\r\n\r\n_Extending the Usefulness of the Bureau to the Aviators._--Practical\r\nutilization by the aviators of this district of the information\r\npossessed by the Bureau has received considerable impetus during the\r\npast six months. During the cross-country flights of April and May,\r\n1916, the Los Angeles station was directed by the Chief of Bureau\r\nto furnish weather and flight conditions between San Diego and Los\r\nAngeles. With the aid of the general weather-map data from the regular\r\nstations, and special observations of wind, weather, and fog conditions\r\non the immediate coast near Los Angeles, and on Mount Wilson, it\r\nwas possible to issue satisfactory forecasts of flying conditions.\r\nThe eye-observations of fog-heights as determined by the Weather\r\nBureau coöperative station at the Mount Wilson Solar Observatory were\r\nespecially valuable. From this mountain (6,000 feet elevation) it\r\nis possible on a good day to see the whole length of the coast from\r\nPoint Firmin, San Pedro harbor to Point Loma, San Diego Bay. Knowing\r\ndifferent levels, the observer at Mount Wilson was able to give actual\r\nthickness and extent of the fog-belt and its past twenty-four-hour\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nINVESTIGATING THE UPPER AIR\r\n\r\n\r\n_Balloon Soundings into the Stratosphere._--It was the writer’s\r\nprivilege to be present when some highly interesting and instructive\r\nexperiments made by the Weather Bureau in coöperation with the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, in sounding the upper air were made at Avalon,\r\nSanta Catalina Island, off the coast of southern California in July\r\nand August, 1913.[J] The results of this work were in close agreement\r\nwith similar soundings of the upper air throughout other surveyed\r\nportions of the earth’s atmosphere, and a record ascension for this\r\ncountry was made on July 30--32,643 meters or 20½ miles. In common with\r\nother observations of temperatures in the stratosphere, the minimum\r\ntemperature of these soundings (-90 F., August 3) was registered within\r\nthe first 10 miles.[K]\r\n\r\n    [J] University of California Chronicle, 1915, 17:1–25, Berkeley.\r\n\r\n    [K] Monthly Weather Review, 1914, 42:410, Washington.\r\n\r\nOf especial interest to the aviator is the table on the next page\r\nwhich shows wind velocities increasing with elevation as determined by\r\nobservations of the Avalon balloons.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECORD OF AVALON ASCENTS, JULY-AUGUST, 1913\r\n\r\n_Table showing Theodolite observations of wind velocities (meters per\r\nsecond) at elevations of 1,000 and 5,000 meters_\r\n\r\n  ======+=======+=======+=======+=======+=======+======+======+======+====\r\n        |Meters |Meters |Meters |Meters |Meters |Meters|Meters|Meters|\r\n        | per   | per   | per   | per   | per   | per  | per  | per  |\r\n  Meters|second |second |second |second |second |second|second|second|Mean\r\n        |5 p.m. |5 p.m. |10 a.m.|10 a.m.|10 a.m.|5 p.m.|4 p.m.|5 p.m.|\r\n        |July 24|July 27|July 31|Aug. 1 |Aug. 2 |Aug. 3|Aug. 7|Aug. 8|\r\n  ------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+------+------+----\r\n  1,000 |  2.5  |  1.0  |  5.6  |  6.6  |  2.3  |  5.8 |  7.1 |  1.9 | 4.1\r\n  1,500 |  6.2  |  0.8  |  6.2  |  8.1  |  3.3  |  5.0 |  6.4 |  1.5 | 4.7\r\n  2,000 |  8.0  |  1.2  |  5.8  |  7.0  |  4.1  |  4.5 |  6.5 |  6.0 | 5.4\r\n  2,500 | 10.0  |  1.8  | 10.8  |  5.7  |  5.2  |  4.2 |  4.7 |  3.6 | 5.8\r\n  3,000 | 12.0  |  2.3  |  9.4  |  6.1  |  7.2  |  5.2 |  3.5 |  4.1 | 6.2\r\n  3,500 | 12.8  |  2.5  |  8.0  |  6.7  |  7.4  |  6.1 |  4.6 |  4.6 | 6.6\r\n  4,000 | 13.6  |  3.8  | 11.2  |  7.4  |  9.2  |  5.2 |  6.4 |  3.2 | 7.5\r\n  4,500 | 14.3  |  5.2  | 14.6  |  8.5  | 11.2  |  1.8 |  7.8 |  3.0 | 8.3\r\n  5,000 | 21.2  |  6.2  | 12.8  | 10.3  | 10.4  |  2.3 |      |  3.4 | 9.5\r\n  ------+-------+-------+-------+-------+-------+------+------+------+----\r\n\r\n\r\n_Charts Showing Upper-air Weather Conditions._--It is believed that\r\nthe following charts when examined in connection with the accompanying\r\nexplanation in the text will give the reader something of an outline as\r\nto the conditions existing in the upper regions of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART NO. 1\r\n\r\n_Horizontal Projections of the Paths of the Sounding Balloons Liberated\r\nat Avalon, California, July 23 to August 10, 1913_\r\n\r\n    Reproduced from the _Monthly Weather Review_, 42: 423\r\n\r\n    This figure shows the horizontal projections as far as the\r\n    balloon was observed, not the entire distance traveled until it\r\n    landed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART NO. 2\r\n\r\n_Vertical Temperature Gradient, Avalon, California, July 27, 1913_\r\n\r\n    Solid line represents the ascent of the recording apparatus,\r\n    the dotted line the descent.

R. Blair, Professor of\r\n    Meteorology, in the _Monthly Weather Review_, for July, 1914,\r\n    it is learned that the wind shifts from west to east rather\r\n    abruptly at 16 to 20 km. (10 to 12 miles); below this level\r\n    down to about 5 km. (3 miles) it is quite uniformly from the\r\n    west.

Beyond the 5,000 meters the records show that\r\n    from 2 to 7 miles altitude the wind increases at approximately\r\n    the same rate that the density of the air decreases.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART NO. 5\r\n\r\n_Chart Showing Number of Flights and Duration in Hours for the Months\r\nof July to December, 1915, and January to August, 1916_\r\n\r\n    Prepared by the War Department, Signal Corps Aviation School,\r\n    San Diego, California, and furnished through the courtesy of\r\n    Col.

He has since qualified as an aviator and made a\r\n    brilliant record in the Mexican activities in 1916.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. POINT LOMA FROM THE EASTERN SHORE OF NORTH\r\nISLAND\r\n\r\n_Photographed October, 1915_\r\n\r\n    The peninsula of Point Loma rises to an elevation approximating\r\n    500 feet, and as it lies approximately north and south, it\r\n    interposes a considerable barrier to the prevailing westerly\r\n    winds. The eastern side of Point Loma is very precipitous.\r\n    These factors tend to produce winds called “woollies” which are\r\n    a distinct menace to all small boats and air-craft, unless the\r\n    air-craft have an elevation exceeding 3,000 feet on a normal\r\n    windy day.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. SAN DIEGO, ACROSS SPANISH BIGHT, AS SEEN FROM\r\nTHE U. S. AVIATION SCHOOL AT TWILIGHT\r\n\r\n_Photographed October, 1915_\r\n\r\n    Contrasted with the photograph of Point Loma on the opposite\r\n    page, this picture shows the ideal water conditions for trying\r\n    out seaplanes. Shortly before this picture was taken, one of\r\n    the pilots of the Curtiss Aviation School, also on North Island\r\n    drove a big seaplane 100 miles per hour barely skimming the\r\n    surface of the water.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12. INSTRUCTOR BRINDLEY AND METEOROLOGIST CARPENTER\r\nIN MILITARY TRACTOR NO. 50\r\n\r\n_Photographed October 20, 1915_\r\n\r\n    Instructor Oscar Brindley and the observer, Meteorologist Ford\r\n    A. Carpenter, U. S. Weather Bureau, leaving the ground for a\r\n    flight. In the military tractor used generally by the Army,\r\n    the observer sits forward while the pilot occupies the after\r\n    cockpit. This machine, like all others used in the military\r\n    service, has dual control.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13. MILITARY TRACTOR NO. 50. TYPE OF BIPLANE USED\r\nIN U. S.

In\r\n    gusty weather the mechanicians steady the ends of the lower\r\n    planes, sometimes turning it by holding one edge and pushing\r\n    the other. In the photograph the mechanicians are giving the\r\n    airplane steerageway to the right.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15. MILITARY TRACTOR NO. 50 JUST LEAVING THE GROUND\r\n\r\n_Photographed October, 1915_\r\n\r\n    Before attempting to leave the ground there is always\r\n    considerable jockeying for a favorable head-wind, and the\r\n    photograph shows Instructor Brindley maneuvering for a\r\n    favorable pointing.\r\n\r\n    After leaving the ground, the wind, so long as it is not gusty,\r\n    makes no difference to the pilot.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16. SAN DIEGO HARBOR AT OVER 2,000 FEET ALTITUDE\r\n\r\n_Photographed October, 1915_\r\n\r\n    The new municipal wharves are in the middle foreground and to\r\n    their right may be seen the Santa Fé station. Part of North\r\n    Island is obscured by cloud.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17. THIRTY-FIVE HUNDRED FEET ABOVE SAN DIEGO\r\n\r\n_Photographed October, 1915_\r\n\r\n    This photograph was made 1,000 feet above the clouds. The\r\n    wharves of San Diego and Coronado may be seen in the foreground\r\n    and in the middle distance.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18. MILITARY TRACTOR NO. 50 AT 3,500 FEET ALTITUDE\r\n\r\n_Photographed October 20, 1915_\r\n\r\n    The airplane, in which the pilot, Oscar Brindley and the\r\n    observer, Meteorologist Carpenter, made their flight, was\r\n    photographed at the maximum elevation, 3,500 feet above the\r\n    aviation field.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19. FLYING SQUAD’S WIND-DIRECTION PENNANT ON TOWER\r\n\r\n_Photographed October 5, 1915_\r\n\r\n    The regular observation tower from which all observations and\r\n    notes on every flight are made is just back of the headquarters\r\n    building. The station anemometer is on the tower, and the\r\n    portable anemometer is to the left.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20. THE AVIATION SCHOOL MOTOR-BOAT “PRONTO”\r\n\r\n_Photographed October, 1915_\r\n\r\n    During the flying periods, the motor-boat of the U. S. Aviation\r\n    School is kept ready for instant service in order to work in\r\n    conjunction, if needs be, with the Medical Corps emergency\r\n    truck on land.\r\n\r\n    Such is the speed of this boat (exceeding 40 miles per hour)\r\n    that the water no longer has resiliency, and it is about as\r\n    comfortable as riding in an old-fashioned stone-boat over rocky\r\n    pastures.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21. U. S. AVIATION FIELD AT THREE THOUSAND FEET\r\nALTITUDE\r\n\r\n_Photographed October, 1915_\r\n\r\n    Part of Coronado and the portion of land called North Island,\r\n    separated by Spanish Bight. Point Loma may be seen at the\r\n    extreme upper right-hand corner of the photograph. The\r\n    flying-machine sheds, buildings of the Aviation School, etc.,\r\n    may be seen in the immediate foreground. The U. S. Cavalry camp\r\n    is the white splotch in the center foreground.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22. REPAIR SHOP U. S.

Aviation School at North Island\r\n    the motors are given a gruelling test, being run twenty-four\r\n    consecutive hours at a speed greater than that given them in\r\n    actual practice. After this run they are taken down and each\r\n    part is spread out on a large drawing-table and is subjected to\r\n    close scrutiny so as to show any defect. Several airplanes as\r\n    well as seaplanes have been reconstructed in this shop.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s note:\r\n\r\nPunctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant\r\npreference was found in this book; otherwise they were not changed.\r\n\r\nSimple typographical errors were corrected.\r\n\r\nAmbiguous hyphens at the ends of lines were retained; occurrences of\r\ninconsistent hyphenation have not been changed.",
