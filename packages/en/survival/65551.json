The 324-hectare (800-acre) monument\r\nnear the resort community of Mammoth Lakes includes one dominant\r\nfeature: a formation of columnar basalt known as Devils Postpile.\r\nAnother important feature in the area is Rainbow Falls. Pumice is the\r\ndominant rock-type encountered, but basalt, andesite, rhyodacite, and\r\ngranite lie just under the surface and crop out in many places. Plants\r\nand animals are typical of lodgepole pine and red fir forests. To see\r\nthe features of the monument one must walk.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVILS POSTPILE\r\n\r\nThe formation of Devils Postpile began when basalt lava erupted in the\r\nvalley of the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River. As lava flowed from\r\nthe vent, it filled the valley near the Postpile to a depth of 122\r\nmeters (400 feet). Recent radiometric dating of rocks thought to\r\ncorrelate with basalt of Devils Postpile suggest an age of less than\r\n100,000 years.\r\n\r\nSurface cracks formed when tensions caused by the shrinkage of the\r\ncooling lava were greater than the strength of the lava itself. Each\r\ncrack branched when obtaining a critical length and together with other\r\ncracks formed a pattern on the surfaces of the flow. Ideal conditions\r\nallowed surface cracks to deepen, resulting in the formation of long\r\ncolumns.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\nApproximately 10,000 years ago, glaciers flowed down the Middle Fork of\r\nthe San Joaquin River. This moving ice easily overrode the fractured\r\nmass of lava and quarried away one side of the Postpile, exposing a\r\nsheer wall of columns 18 meters (60 feet) high. Many fallen columns now\r\nlie fragmented on the talus slope below.\r\n\r\nA hike to the top of the Postpile reveals not only a cross section of\r\nthe posts, but the most interesting effect of the ice—polished tops of\r\nthe basalt columns. Here, the column ends are exposed like a tiled floor\r\nand exhibit parallel striations where the glacier dragged rocks across\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nEven though Devils Postpile is among the world’s finest examples of\r\ncolumnar-jointed basalt, it is not unique. Giant’s Causeway in Ireland\r\nand Fingal’s Cave in Scotland are similar formations.\r\n\r\n\r\nSODA SPRINGS\r\n\r\nNearby mineral springs are evidence of recent local volcanic activity.\r\nThe Soda Springs lie on a gravel bar in the San Joaquin River just north\r\nof the Postpile. Here, gases driven upward from hot areas deep in the\r\nearth combine with ground water to produce cold and highly carbonated\r\nmineralized springs. The iron present in Soda Springs water oxidizes on\r\nexposure to the atmosphere and stains river gravel a reddish brown.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n\r\nSAFETY\r\n\r\nFor your safety, remember that there are hazards in the mountains that\r\nusually do not exist in the city. Stay on designated trails; these are\r\nthe safest places to hike. Use caution when viewing features from near\r\ncliff or gorge edges. Footing can be hazardous. WARNING: Bears inhabit\r\nthe monument. Proper food storage is required by Federal law.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n  MONUMENT BOUNDARY\r\n  CAMPGROUND\r\n  TO U.S. 396 & MAMMOTH LAKES\r\n  RANGER STATION (_El. 7,560 ft._)\r\n  SOTCHER LAKE\r\n  _Soda Springs_\r\n  DEVILS POSTPILE\r\n  _King Creek Trail_\r\n  _San Joaquin River_\r\n  REDS MEADOW\r\n  THE BUTTRESSES\r\n  _Middle Fork_\r\n  _John Muir Trail_\r\n  _Boundary Creek_\r\n  RAINBOW FALLS (101 feet)\r\n  LOWER FALLS\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: uncaptioned]\r\n\r\n\r\nRAINBOW FALLS\r\n\r\nAt Rainbow Falls the Middle Fork of the San Joaquin River drops 31\r\nmeters (101 feet) over an andesite and rhyodacite cliff. It is thought\r\nthat after the last glacier melted, the river flowed downstream from\r\nDevils Postpile in channels about 457 meters (1,500 feet) west of its\r\npresent course. Flowing in these older channels, it cut through the\r\nrhyodacite lava down to granite, leaving a cliff of rhyodacite for its\r\neastern bank. Then, some distance upstream, the waters were diverted\r\neastward. The river left its bed to follow its present path until it\r\nreturned to the old channel, by cascading down the cliff it had earlier\r\ncut. Thus Rainbow Falls was formed. A stairway and short trail lead to\r\nthe bottom of the falls, where numerous flowers and grasses form an\r\nenchanting garden. Cars may be driven to within 1.6 kilometers (1 mile)\r\nof the falls via the road to Reds Meadow.\r\n\r\n\r\nABOUT YOUR VISIT\r\n\r\nThe monument is reached by a 16-kilometer (10-mile) drive west from U.S.\r\n395 on S.R. 203 to Minaret Summit, then by 11.2 kilometers (7 miles) of\r\npaved narrow mountain road. The monument is administered by the National\r\nPark Service, U.S. Department of the Interior. For more information\r\nwrite: Superintendent, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks, Three\r\nRivers, CA 93271. Park rangers are on duty to assist you, to conduct\r\ninterpretive activities, and to enforce the regulations. _Closed in\r\nwinter._\r\n\r\n_Accommodations and services._ Meals, lodging, groceries, gasoline,\r\nhorses, and other facilities and services are available at Mammoth Lakes\r\nor nearby Reds Meadow.\r\n\r\n_Camping._ A campground is maintained near the ranger station from about\r\nJuly 1 to October 15, depending on the weather.\r\n\r\n_Hiking._ Trips may be made north or south on the John Muir Trail and\r\nwest on the King Creek Trail. The monument also has several short\r\ntrails.\r\n\r\n_Fishing and hunting._ Fishing is permitted in the monument, but hunting\r\nis prohibited. A California angling license with appropriate stamps is\r\nrequired for persons 16 years of age or over.\r\n\r\n_Pets._ Pets are permitted in the monument only if they are kept under\r\ndirect physical control at all times.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         National Park Service\r\n                    U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR\r\n\r\n  GPO 1984—421-613/317 Reprint 1984\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n—Silently corrected a few typos.\r\n\r\n—Retained publication information from the printed edition: this eBook\r\n  is public-domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n—In the text versions only, text in italics is delimited by\r\n  _underscores_.",
