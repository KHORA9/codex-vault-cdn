For the sake of uniformity, I have adopted the style used in\r\nthe charts of the Chagos Archipelago, published by the East Indian\r\nCompany, from the survey by Captain Moresby and Lieutenant Powell. The\r\nsurface of the reef, which dries at low water, is represented by a\r\nsurface with small crosses: the coral-islets on the reef are marked by\r\nsmall linear spaces, on which a few cocoa-nut trees, out of all\r\nproportion too large, have been introduced for the sake of clearness.\r\nThe entire _annular reef_, which when surrounding an open expanse of\r\nwater, forms an “atoll,” and when surrounding one or more high islands,\r\nforms an encircling “barrier-reef,” has a nearly uniform structure. The\r\nreefs in some of the original surveys are represented merely by a\r\nsingle line with crosses, so that their breadth is not given; I have\r\nhad such reefs engraved of the width usually attained by coral-reefs. I\r\nhave not thought it worth while to introduce all those small and very\r\nnumerous reefs, which occur within the lagoons of most atolls and\r\nwithin the lagoon-channels of most barrier-reefs, and which stand\r\neither isolated, or are attached to the shores of the reef or land. At\r\nPeros Banhos none of the lagoon-reefs rise to the surface of the water;\r\na few of them have been introduced, and are marked by plain dotted\r\ncircles. A few of the deepest soundings are laid down within each reef;\r\nthey are in fathoms, of six English feet.\r\n\r\nFigure 1.—VANIKORO, situated in the western part of the South Pacific;\r\ntaken from the survey by Captain D’Urville in the _Astrolabe;_ the\r\nsoundings on the southern side of the island, namely, from thirty to\r\nforty fathoms, are given from the voyage of the Chev. Dillon; the other\r\nsoundings are laid down from the survey by D’Urville; height of the\r\nsummit of the island is 3,032 feet. The principal small detached reefs\r\nwithin the lagoon-channel have in this instance been represented. The\r\nsouthern shore of the island is narrowly fringed by a reef: if the\r\nengraver had carried this reef entirely round both islands, this figure\r\nwould have served (by leaving out in imagination the barrier-reef) as a\r\ngood specimen of an abruptly-sided island, surrounded by a reef of the\r\nfringing class.\r\n\r\nFigure 2.—HOGOLEU, or ROUG, in the Caroline Archipelago; taken from the\r\natlas of the voyage of the _Astrolabe_, compiled from the surveys of\r\nCaptains Duperrey and D’Urville; the depth of the immense lagoon-like\r\nspace within the reef is not known.\r\n\r\nFigure 3.—RAIATEA, in the Society Archipelago; from the map given in\r\nthe quarto edition of “Cook’s First Voyage;” it is probably not\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\nFigure 4.—BOW, or HEYOU ATOLL (or lagoon-island), in the Low\r\nArchipelago, from the survey by Captain Beechey, R.N.; the lagoon is\r\nchoked up with reefs, but the average greatest depth of about twenty\r\nfathoms, is given from the published account of the voyage.\r\n\r\nFigure 5.—BOLABOLA, in the Society Archipelago, from the survey of\r\nCaptain Duperrey in the _Coquille:_ the soundings in this and the\r\nfollowing figures have been altered from French feet to English\r\nfathoms; height of highest point of the island 4,026 feet.\r\n\r\nFigure 6.—MAURUA, in the Society Archipelago; from the survey by\r\nCaptain Duperrey in the _Coquille:_ height of land about eight hundred\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nFigure 7.—POUYNIPÈTE, or SENIAVINE, in the Caroline Archipelago; from\r\nthe survey by Admiral Lutké.\r\n\r\nFigure 8.—GAMBIER ISLANDS, in the southern part of the Low Archipelago;\r\nfrom the survey by Captain Beechey; height of highest island, 1,246\r\nfeet; the islands are surrounded by extensive and irregular reefs; the\r\nreef on the southern side is submerged.\r\n\r\nFigure 9.—PEROS BANHOS ATOLL (or lagoon-island), in the Chagos group in\r\nthe Indian Ocean; from the survey by Captain Moresby and Lieutenant\r\nPowell; not nearly all the small submerged reefs in the lagoon are\r\nrepresented; the annular reef on the southern side is submerged.\r\n\r\nFigure 10.—KEELING, or COCOS ATOLL (or lagoon-island), in the Indian\r\nOcean; from the survey by Captain Fitzroy; the lagoon south of the\r\ndotted line is very shallow, and is left almost bare at low water; the\r\npart north of the line is choked up with irregular reefs. The annular\r\nreef on the north-west side is broken, and blends into a shoal\r\nsandbank, on which the sea breaks.\r\n\r\nPLATE II.—GREAT CHAGOS BANK, NEW CALEDONIA, MENCHIKOFF ATOLL, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: Plate 2\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1.—GREAT CHAGOS BANK, in the Indian Ocean; taken from the survey\r\nby Captain Moresby and Lieutenant Powell; the parts which are shaded,\r\nwith the exception of two or three islets on the western and northern\r\nsides, do not rise to the surface, but are submerged from four to ten\r\nfathoms; the banks bounded by the dotted lines lie from fifteen to\r\ntwenty fathoms beneath the surface, and are formed of sand; the central\r\nspace is of mud, and from thirty to fifty fathoms deep.\r\n\r\nFigure 2.—A vertical section, on the same scale, in an eastern and\r\nwestern line across the Great Chagos Bank, given for the sake of\r\nexhibiting more clearly its structure.\r\n\r\nFigure 3.—MENCHIKOFF ATOLL (or lagoon-island), in the Marshall\r\nArchipelago, Northern Pacific Ocean; from Krusenstern’s “Atlas of the\r\nPacific;” originally surveyed by Captain Hagemeister; the depth within\r\nthe lagoons is unknown.\r\n\r\nFigure 4.—MAHLOS MAHDOO ATOLL, together with Horsburgh atoll, in the\r\nMaldiva Archipelago; from the survey by Captain Moresby and Lieutenant\r\nPowell; the white spaces in the middle of the separate small reefs,\r\nboth on the margin and in the middle part, are meant to represent\r\nlittle lagoons; but it was found not possible to distinguish them\r\nclearly from the small islets, which have been formed on these same\r\nsmall reefs; many of the smaller reefs could not be introduced; the\r\nnautical mark (dot over a dash) over the figures 250 and 200, between\r\nMahlos Mahdoo and Horsburgh atoll and Powell’s island, signifies that\r\nsoundings were not obtained at these depths.\r\n\r\nFigure 5.—NEW CALEDONIA, in the western part of the Pacific; from\r\nKrusenstern’s “Atlas,” compiled from several surveys; I have slightly\r\naltered the northern point of the reef, in accordance with the “Atlas\r\nof the Voyage of the _Astrolabe_.” In Krusenstern’s “Atlas,” the reef\r\nis represented by a single line with crosses; I have for the sake of\r\nuniformity added an interior line.\r\n\r\nFigure 6.—MALDIVA ARCHIPELAGO, in the Indian Ocean; from the survey by\r\nCaptain Moresby and Lieutenant Powell.\r\n\r\nPLATE III.—MAP SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION OF CORAL-REEFS AND ACTIVE\r\nVOLCANOES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustration: Plate 3 Shewing the Distribution of the Different Kinds\r\nof Coral Reefs, Together with the Position of the Active Volcanoes in\r\nthe Map.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principles, on which this map was coloured, are explained in the\r\nbeginning of Chapter VI.; and the authorities for each particular spot\r\nare detailed in the Appendix to “Coral Reefs.” The names not printed in\r\nupper case in the Index refer to the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRUCTURE AND DISTRIBUTION OF CORAL REEFS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of this volume is to describe from my own observation and\r\nthe works of others, the principal kinds of coral-reefs, more\r\nespecially those occurring in the open ocean, and to explain the origin\r\nof their peculiar forms. I do not here treat of the polypifers, which\r\nconstruct these vast works, except so far as relates to their\r\ndistribution, and to the conditions favourable to their vigorous\r\ngrowth. Without any distinct intention to classify coral-reefs, most\r\nvoyagers have spoken of them under the following heads:\r\n“lagoon-islands,” or “atolls,” “barrier” or “encircling reefs,” and\r\n“fringing” or “shore-reefs.” The lagoon-islands have received much the\r\nmost attention; and it is not surprising, for every one must be struck\r\nwith astonishment, when he first beholds one of these vast rings of\r\ncoral-rock, often many leagues in diameter, here and there surmounted\r\nby a low verdant island with dazzling white shores, bathed on the\r\noutside by the foaming breakers of the ocean, and on the inside\r\nsurrounding a calm expanse of water, which from reflection, is of a\r\nbright but pale green colour. The naturalist will feel this\r\nastonishment more deeply after having examined the soft and almost\r\ngelatinous bodies of these apparently insignificant creatures, and when\r\nhe knows that the solid reef increases only on the outer edge, which\r\nday and night is lashed by the breakers of an ocean never at rest. Well\r\ndid François Pyrard de Laval, in the year 1605, exclaim, “C’est une\r\nmerueille de voir chacun de ces atollons, enuironné d’un grand banc de\r\npierre tout autour, n’y ayant point d’artifice humain.” The\r\naccompanying sketch of Whitsunday island, in the South Pacific, taken\r\nfrom Captain Beechey’s admirable “Voyage,” although excellent of its\r\nkind, gives but a faint idea of the singular aspect of one of these\r\nlagoon-islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhitsunday Island is of small size, and the whole circle has been\r\nconverted into land, which is a comparatively rare circumstance. As the\r\nreef of a lagoon-island generally supports many separate small islands,\r\nthe word “island,” applied to the whole, is often the cause of\r\nconfusion; hence I have invariably used in this volume the term\r\n“atoll,” which is the name given to these circular groups of\r\ncoral-islets by their inhabitants in the Indian Ocean, and is\r\nsynonymous with “lagoon-island.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBarrier-reefs, when encircling small islands, have been comparatively\r\nlittle noticed by voyagers; but they well deserve attention. In their\r\nstructure they are little less marvellous than atolls, and they give a\r\nsingular and most picturesque character to the scenery of the islands\r\nthey surround. In the accompanying sketch, taken from the “Voyage of\r\nthe ‘Coquille’,” the reef is seen from within, from one of the high\r\npeaks of the island of Bolabola.[1] Here, as in Whitsunday Island, the\r\nwhole of that part of the reef which is visible is converted into land.\r\nThis is a circumstance of rare occurrence; more usually a snow-white\r\nline of great breakers, with here and there an islet crowned by\r\ncocoa-nut trees, separates the smooth waters of the lagoon-like channel\r\nfrom the waves of the open sea. The barrier-reefs of Australia and of\r\nNew Caledonia, owing to their enormous dimensions, have excited much\r\nattention: in structure and form they resemble those encircling many of\r\nthe smaller islands in the Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n [1] I have taken the liberty of simplifying the foreground, and\r\n leaving out a mountainous island in the far distance.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith respect to fringing, or shore-reefs, there is little in their\r\nstructure which needs explanation; and their name expresses their\r\ncomparatively small extension. They differ from barrier-reefs in not\r\nlying so far from the shore, and in not having within a broad channel\r\nof deep water. Reefs also occur around submerged banks of sediment and\r\nof worn-down rock; and others are scattered quite irregularly where the\r\nsea is very shallow; these in most respects are allied to those of the\r\nfringing class, but they are of comparatively little interest.\r\n\r\nI have given a separate chapter to each of the above classes, and have\r\ndescribed some one reef or island, on which I possessed most\r\ninformation, as typical; and have afterwards compared it with others of\r\na like kind. Although this classification is useful from being obvious,\r\nand from including most of the coral-reefs existing in the open sea, it\r\nadmits of a more fundamental division into barrier and atoll-formed\r\nreefs on the one hand, where there is a great apparent difficulty with\r\nrespect to the foundation on which they must first have grown; and into\r\nfringing-reefs on the other, where, owing to the nature of the slope of\r\nthe adjoining land, there is no such difficulty. The two blue tints and\r\nthe red colour (replaced by numbers in this edition.) on the map (Plate\r\nIII.), represent this main division, as explained in the beginning of\r\nthe last chapter. In the Appendix, every existing coral-reef, except\r\nsome on the coast of Brazil not included in the map, is briefly\r\ndescribed in geographical order, as far as I possessed information; and\r\nany particular spot may be found by consulting the Index.\r\n\r\nSeveral theories have been advanced to explain the origin of atolls or\r\nlagoon-islands, but scarcely one to account for barrier-reefs. From the\r\nlimited depths at which reef-building polypifers can flourish, taken\r\ninto consideration with certain other circumstances, we are compelled\r\nto conclude, as it will be seen, that both in atolls and barrier-reefs,\r\nthe foundation on which the coral was primarily attached, has subsided;\r\nand that during this downward movement, the reefs have grown upwards.\r\nThis conclusion, it will be further seen, explains most satisfactorily\r\nthe outline and general form of atolls and barrier-reefs, and likewise\r\ncertain peculiarities in their structure. The distribution, also, of\r\nthe different kinds of coral-reefs, and their position with relation to\r\nthe areas of recent elevation, and to the points subject to volcanic\r\neruptions, fully accord with this theory of their origin.[2]\r\n\r\n [2] A brief account of my views on coral formations, now published in\r\n my Journal of Researches, was read May 31st, 1837, before the\r\n Geological Society, and an abstract has appeared in the Proceedings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nATOLLS OR LAGOON-ISLANDS.\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—KEELING ATOLL.\r\n\r\nCorals on the outer margin.—Zone of Nulliporæ.—Exterior\r\nreef.—Islets.—Coral-conglomerate.—Lagoon.—Calcareous sediment.—Scari\r\nand Holuthuriæ subsisting on corals.—Changes in the condition of the\r\nreefs and islets.—Probable subsidence of the atoll.—Future state of the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA.—Level of the sea at low water: where the letter A is placed, the\r\ndepth is twenty-five fathoms, and the distance rather more than one\r\nhundred and fifty yards from the edge of the reef.\r\n\r\nB.—Outer edge of that flat part of the reef, which dries at low water:\r\nthe edge either consists of a convex mound, as represented, or of\r\nrugged points, like those a little farther seaward, beneath the water.\r\n\r\nC.—A flat of coral-rock, covered at high water.\r\n\r\nD.—A low projecting ledge of brecciated coral-rock washed by the waves\r\nat high water.\r\n\r\nE.—A slope of loose fragments, reached by the sea only during gales:\r\nthe upper part, which is from six to twelve feet high, is clothed with\r\nvegetation. The surface of the islet gently slopes to the lagoon.\r\n\r\nF.—Level of the lagoon at low water.\r\n\r\nKeeling or Cocos atoll is situated in the Indian Ocean, in 12° 5′ S.,\r\nand longitude 90° 55′ E.: a reduced chart of it was made from the\r\nsurvey of Captain Fitzroy and the Officers of H.M.S. “Beagle,” is given\r\nin Plate I., Figure 10. The greatest width of this atoll is nine miles\r\nand a half. Its structure is in most respects characteristic of the\r\nclass to which it belongs, with the exception of the shallowness of the\r\nlagoon. The accompanying woodcut represents a vertical section,\r\nsupposed to be drawn at low water from the outer coast across one of\r\nthe low islets (one being taken of average dimensions) to within the\r\nlagoon.\r\n\r\nThe section is true to the scale in a horizontal line, but it could not\r\nbe made so in a vertical one, as the average greatest height of the\r\nland is only between six and twelve feet above high-water mark.\r\n\r\nI will describe the section, commencing with the outer margin. I must\r\nfirst observe that the reef-building polypifers, not being tidal\r\nanimals, require to be constantly submerged or washed by the breakers.\r\nI was assured by Mr. Liesk, a very intelligent resident on these\r\nislands, as well as by some chiefs at Tahiti (Otaheite), that an\r\nexposure to the rays of the sun for a very short time invariably causes\r\ntheir destruction. Hence it is possible only under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, afforded by an unusually low tide and smooth water, to\r\nreach the outer margin, where the coral is alive. I succeeded only\r\ntwice in gaining this part, and found it almost entirely composed of a\r\nliving Porites, which forms great irregularly rounded masses (like\r\nthose of an Astræa, but larger) from four to eight feet broad, and\r\nlittle less in thickness. These mounds are separated from each other by\r\nnarrow crooked channels, about six feet deep, most of which intersect\r\nthe line of reef at right angles. On the furthest mound, which I was\r\nable to reach by the aid of a leaping-pole, and over which the sea\r\nbroke with some violence, although the day was quite calm and the tide\r\nlow, the polypifers in the uppermost cells were all dead, but between\r\nthree and four inches lower down on its side they were living, and\r\nformed a projecting border round the upper and dead surface. The coral\r\nbeing thus checked in its upward growth, extends laterally, and hence\r\nmost of the masses, especially those a little further inwards, had\r\nbroad flat dead summits. On the other hand I could see, during the\r\nrecoil of the breakers, that a few yards further seaward, the whole\r\nconvex surface of the Porites was alive; so that the point where we\r\nwere standing was almost on the exact upward and shoreward limit of\r\nexistence of those corals which form the outer margin of the reef. We\r\nshall presently see that there are other organic productions, fitted to\r\nbear a somewhat longer exposure to the air and sun.\r\n\r\nNext, but much inferior in importance to the Porites, is the _Millepora\r\ncomplanata_.[1] It grows in thick vertical plates, intersecting each\r\nother at various angles, and forms an exceedingly strong honeycombed\r\nmass, which generally affects a circular form, the marginal plates\r\nalone being alive. Between these plates and in the protected crevices\r\non the reef, a multitude of branching zoophytes and other productions\r\nflourish, but the Porites and Millepora alone seem able to resist the\r\nfury of the breakers on its upper and outer edge: at the depth of a few\r\nfathoms other kinds of stony corals live. Mr. Liesk, who was intimately\r\nacquainted with every part of this reef, and likewise with that of\r\nNorth Keeling atoll, assured me that these corals invariably compose\r\nthe outer margin. The lagoon is inhabited by quite a distinct set of\r\ncorals, generally brittle and thinly branched; but a Porites,\r\napparently of the same species with that on the outside, is found\r\nthere, although it does not seem to thrive, and certainly does not\r\nattain the thousandth part in bulk of the masses opposed to the\r\nbreakers.\r\n\r\n [1] This Millepora (Palmipora of Blainville), as well as the _M.\r\n alcicornis_, possesses the singular property of stinging the skin\r\n where it is delicate, as on the face and arm.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woodcut shows the form of the bottom off the reef: the water\r\ndeepens for a space between one and two hundred yards wide, very\r\ngradually to twenty-five fathoms (_A_ in section), beyond which the\r\nsides plunge into the unfathomable ocean at an angle of 45°.[2] To the\r\ndepth of ten or twelve fathoms the bottom is exceedingly rugged, and\r\nseems formed of great masses of living coral, similar to those on the\r\nmargin. The arming of the lead here invariably came up quite clean, but\r\ndeeply indented, and chains and anchors which were lowered, in the\r\nhopes of tearing up the coral, were broken. Many small fragments,\r\nhowever, of _Millepora alcicornis_ were brought up; and on the arming\r\nfrom an eight-fathom cast, there was a perfect impression of an Astræa,\r\napparently alive. I examined the rolled fragments cast on the beach\r\nduring gales, in order further to ascertain what corals grew outside\r\nthe reef. The fragments consisted of many kinds, of which the Porites\r\nalready mentioned and a Madrepora, apparently the _M. corymbosa_, were\r\nthe most abundant. As I searched in vain in the hollows on the reef and\r\nin the lagoon, for a living specimen of this Madrepore, I conclude that\r\nit is confined to a zone outside, and beneath the surface, where it\r\nmust be very abundant. Fragments of the _Millepora alcicornis_ and of\r\nan Astræa were also numerous; the former is found, but not in\r\nproportionate numbers, in the hollows on the reef; but the Astræa I did\r\nnot see living. Hence we may infer, that these are the kinds of coral\r\nwhich form the rugged sloping surface (represented in the woodcut by an\r\nuneven line), round and beneath the external margin. Between twelve and\r\ntwenty fathoms the arming came up an equal number of times smoothed\r\nwith sand, and indented with coral: an anchor and lead were lost at the\r\nrespective depths of thirteen and sixteen fathoms. Out of twenty-five\r\nsoundings taken at a greater depth than twenty fathoms, every one\r\nshowed that the bottom was covered with sand; whereas, at a less depth\r\nthan twelve fathoms, every sounding showed that it was exceedingly\r\nrugged, and free from all extraneous particles. Two soundings were\r\nobtained at the depth of 360 fathoms, and several between two hundred\r\nand three hundred fathoms. The sand brought up from these depths\r\nconsisted of finely triturated fragments of stony zoophytes, but not,\r\nas far as I could distinguish, of a particle of any lamelliform genus:\r\nfragments of shells were rare.\r\n\r\n [2] The soundings from which this section is laid down were taken with\r\n great care by Captain Fitzroy himself. He used a bell-shaped lead,\r\n having a diameter of four inches, and the armings each time were cut\r\n off and brought on board for me to examine. The arming is a\r\n preparation of tallow, placed in the concavity at the bottom of the\r\n lead. Sand, and even small fragments of rock, will adhere to it; and\r\n if the bottom be of rock it brings up an exact impression of its\r\n surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a distance of 2,200 yards from the breakers, Captain Fitzroy found\r\nno bottom with a line of 7,200 feet in length; hence the submarine\r\nslope of this coral formation is steeper than that of any volcanic\r\ncone. Off the mouth of the lagoon, and likewise off the northern point\r\nof the atoll, where the currents act violently, the inclination, owing\r\nto the accumulation of sediment, is less. As the arming of the lead\r\nfrom all the greater depths showed a smooth sandy bottom, I at first\r\nconcluded that the whole consisted of a vast conical pile of calcareous\r\nsand, but the sudden increase of depth at some points, and the\r\ncircumstance of the line having been cut, as if rubbed, when between\r\nfive hundred and six hundred fathoms were out, indicate the probable\r\nexistence of submarine cliffs.\r\n\r\nOn the margin of the reef, close within the line where the upper\r\nsurface of the Porites and of the Millepora is dead, three species of\r\nNullipora flourish. One grows in thin sheets, like a lichen on old\r\ntrees; the second in stony knobs, as thick as a man’s finger, radiating\r\nfrom a common centre; and the third, which is less common, in a\r\nmoss-like reticulation of thin, but perfectly rigid branches.[3] The\r\nthree species occur either separately or mingled together; and they\r\nform by their successive growth a layer two or three feet in thickness,\r\nwhich in some cases is hard, but where formed of the lichen-like kind,\r\nreadily yields an impression to the hammer: the surface is of a reddish\r\ncolour. These Nulliporæ, although able to exist above the limit of true\r\ncorals, seem to require to be bathed during the greater part of each\r\ntide by breaking water, for they are not found in any abundance in the\r\nprotected hollows on the back part of the reef, where they might be\r\nimmersed either during the whole or an equal proportional time of each\r\ntide. It is remarkable that organic productions of such extreme\r\nsimplicity, for the Nulliporæ undoubtedly belong to one of the lowest\r\nclasses of the vegetable kingdom, should be limited to a zone so\r\npeculiarly circumstanced. Hence the layer composed by their growth\r\nmerely fringes the reef for a space of about twenty yards in width,\r\neither under the form of separate mammillated projections, where the\r\nouter masses of coral are separate, or, more commonly, where the corals\r\nare united into a solid margin, as a continuous smooth convex mound\r\n(_B_ in woodcut), like an artificial breakwater. Both the mound and\r\nmammillated projections stand about three feet higher than any other\r\npart of the reef, by which term I do not include the islets, formed by\r\nthe accumulation of rolled fragments. We shall hereafter see that other\r\ncoral reefs are protected by a similar thick growth of Nulliporæ on the\r\nouter margin, the part most exposed to the breakers, and this must\r\neffectually aid in preserving it from being worn down.\r\n\r\n [3] This last species is of a beautiful bright peach-blossom colour.\r\n Its branches are about as thick as crow-quills; they are slightly\r\n flattened and knobbed at the extremities. The extremities only are\r\n alive and brightly coloured. The two other species are of a dirty\r\n purplish-white. The second species is extremely hard; its short\r\n knob-like branches are cylindrical, and do not grow thicker at their\r\n extremities.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe woodcut represents a section across one of the islets on the reef,\r\nbut if all that part which is above the level of _C_ were removed, the\r\nsection would be that of a simple reef, as it occurs where no islet has\r\nbeen formed. It is this reef which essentially forms the atoll. It is a\r\nring, enclosing the lagoon on all sides except at the northern end,\r\nwhere there are two open spaces, through one of which ships can enter.\r\nThe reef varies in width from two hundred and fifty to five hundred\r\nyards, its surface is level, or very slightly inclined towards the\r\nlagoon, and at high tide the sea breaks entirely over it: the water at\r\nlow tide thrown by the breakers on the reef, is carried by the many\r\nnarrow and shoal gullies or channels on its surface, into the lagoon: a\r\nreturn stream sets out of the lagoon through the main entrance. The\r\nmost frequent coral in the hollows on the reef is _Pocillopora\r\nverrucosa_, which grows in short sinuous plates, or branches, and when\r\nalive is of a beautiful pale lake-red: a Madrepora, closely allied or\r\nidentical with _M. pocillifera_, is also common. As soon as an islet is\r\nformed, and the waves are prevented breaking entirely over the reef,\r\nthe channels and hollows in it become filled up with cemented\r\nfragments, and its surface is converted into a hard smooth floor (_C_\r\nof woodcut), like an artificial one of freestone. This flat surface\r\nvaries in width from one hundred to two hundred, or even three hundred\r\nyards, and is strewed with a few large fragments of coral torn up\r\nduring gales: it is uncovered only at low water. I could with\r\ndifficulty, and only by the aid of a chisel, procure chips of rock from\r\nits surface, and therefore could not ascertain how much of it is formed\r\nby the aggregation of detritus, and how much by the outward growth of\r\nmounds of corals, similar to those now living on the margin. Nothing\r\ncan be more singular than the appearance at low tide of this “flat” of\r\nnaked stone, especially where it is externally bounded by the smooth\r\nconvex mound of Nulliporæ, appearing like a breakwater built to resist\r\nthe waves, which are constantly throwing over it sheets of foaming\r\nwater. The characteristic appearance of this “flat” is shown in the\r\nforegoing woodcut of Whitsunday atoll.\r\n\r\nThe islets on the reef are first formed between two hundred and three\r\nhundred yards from its outer edge, through the accumulation of a pile\r\nof fragments, thrown together by some unusually strong gale. Their\r\nordinary width is under a quarter of a mile, and their length varies\r\nfrom a few yards to several miles. Those on the south-east and windward\r\nside of the atoll, increase solely by the addition of fragments on\r\ntheir outer side; hence the loose blocks of coral, of which their\r\nsurface is composed, as well as the shells mingled with them, almost\r\nexclusively consist of those kinds which live on the outer coast. The\r\nhighest part of the islets (excepting hillocks of blown sand, some of\r\nwhich are thirty feet high), is close to the outer beach (_E_ of the\r\nwoodcut), and averages from six to ten feet above ordinary high-water\r\nmark. From the outer beach the surface slopes gently to the shores of\r\nthe lagoon, which no doubt has been caused by the breakers the further\r\nthey have rolled over the reef, having had less power to throw up\r\nfragments. The little waves of the lagoon heap up sand and fragments of\r\nthinly-branched corals on the inner side of the islets on the leeward\r\nside of the atoll; and these islets are broader than those to windward,\r\nsome being even eight hundred yards in width; but the land thus added\r\nis very low. The fragments beneath the surface are cemented into a\r\nsolid mass, which is exposed as a ledge (_D_ of the woodcut),\r\nprojecting some yards in front of the outer shore and from two to four\r\nfeet high. This ledge is just reached by the waves at ordinary\r\nhigh-water: it extends in front of all the islets, and everywhere has a\r\nwater-worn and scooped appearance. The fragments of coral which are\r\noccasionally cast on the “flat” are during gales of unusual violence\r\nswept together on the beach, where the waves each day at high-water\r\ntend to remove and gradually wear them down; but the lower fragments\r\nhaving become firmly cemented together by the percolation of calcareous\r\nmatter, resist the daily tides longer, and hence project as a ledge.\r\nThe cemented mass is generally of a white colour, but in some few parts\r\nreddish from ferruginous matter; it is very hard, and is sonorous under\r\nthe hammer; it is obscurely divided by seams, dipping at a small angle\r\nseaward; it consists of fragments of the corals which grow on the outer\r\nmargin, some quite and others partially rounded, some small and others\r\nbetween two and three feet across; and of masses of previously formed\r\nconglomerate, torn up, rounded, and re-cemented; or it consists of a\r\ncalcareous sandstone, entirely composed of rounded particles, generally\r\nalmost blended together, of shells, corals, the spines of echini, and\r\nother such organic bodies; rocks, of this latter kind, occur on many\r\nshores, where there are no coral reefs. The structure of the coral in\r\nthe conglomerate has generally been much obscured by the infiltration\r\nof spathose calcareous matter; and I collected a very interesting\r\nseries, beginning with fragments of unaltered coral, and ending with\r\nothers, where it was impossible to discover with the naked eye any\r\ntrace of organic structure. In some specimens I was unable, even with\r\nthe aid of a lens, and by wetting them, to distinguish the boundaries\r\nof the altered coral and spathose limestone. Many even of the blocks of\r\ncoral lying loose on the beach, had their central parts altered and\r\ninfiltrated.\r\n\r\nThe lagoon alone remains to be described; it is much shallower than\r\nthat of most atolls of considerable size. The southern part is almost\r\nfilled up with banks of mud and fields of coral, both dead and alive,\r\nbut there are considerable spaces, between three and four fathoms, and\r\nsmaller basins, from eight to ten fathoms deep. Probably about half its\r\narea consists of sediment, and half of coral-reefs. The corals\r\ncomposing these reefs have a very different aspect from those on the\r\noutside; they are very numerous in kind, and most of them are thinly\r\nbranched. Meandrina, however, lives in the lagoon, and great rounded\r\nmasses of this coral are numerous, lying quite or almost loose on the\r\nbottom. The other commonest kinds consist of three closely allied\r\nspecies of true Madrepora in thin branches; of _Seriatapora subulata;_\r\ntwo species of Porites[4] with cylindrical branches, one of which forms\r\ncircular clumps, with the exterior branches only alive; and lastly, a\r\ncoral something like an Explanaria, but with stars on both surfaces,\r\ngrowing in thin, brittle, stony, foliaceous expansions, especially in\r\nthe deeper basins of the lagoon. The reefs on which these corals grow\r\nare very irregular in form, are full of cavities, and have not a solid\r\nflat surface of dead rock, like that surrounding the lagoon; nor can\r\nthey be nearly so hard, for the inhabitants made with crowbars a\r\nchannel of considerable length through these reefs, in which a\r\nschooner, built on the S.E. islet, was floated out. It is a very\r\ninteresting circumstance, pointed out to us by Mr. Liesk, that this\r\nchannel, although made less than ten years before our visit, was then,\r\nas we saw, almost choked up with living coral, so that fresh\r\nexcavations would be absolutely necessary to allow another vessel to\r\npass through it.\r\n\r\n [4] This Porites has somewhat the habit of _P. clavaria_, but the\r\n branches are not knobbed at their ends. When alive it is of a yellow\r\n colour, but after having been washed in fresh water and placed to dry,\r\n a jet-black slimy substance exuded from the entire surface, so that\r\n the specimen now appears as if it had been dipped in ink.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sediment from the deepest parts in the lagoon, when wet, appeared\r\nchalky, but when dry, like very fine sand. Large soft banks of similar,\r\nbut even finer grained mud, occur on the S.E. shore of the lagoon,\r\naffording a thick growth of a Fucus, on which turtle feed: this mud,\r\nalthough discoloured by vegetable matter, appears from its entire\r\nsolution in acids to be purely calcareous. I have seen in the Museum of\r\nthe Geological Society, a similar but more remarkable substance,\r\nbrought by Lieutenant Nelson from the reefs of Bermuda, which, when\r\nshown to several experienced geologists, was mistaken by them for true\r\nchalk. On the outside of the reef much sediment must be formed by the\r\naction of the surf on the rolled fragments of coral; but in the calm\r\nwaters of the lagoon, this can take place only in a small degree. There\r\nare, however, other and unexpected agents at work here: large shoals of\r\ntwo species of Scarus, one inhabiting the surf outside the reef and the\r\nother the lagoon, subsist entirely, as I was assured by Mr. Liesk, the\r\nintelligent resident before referred to, by browsing on the living\r\npolypifers. I opened several of these fish, which are very numerous and\r\nof considerable size, and I found their intestines distended by small\r\npieces of coral, and finely ground calcareous matter. This must daily\r\npass from them as the finest sediment; much also must be produced by\r\nthe infinitely numerous vermiform and molluscous animals, which make\r\ncavities in almost every block of coral. Dr. J. Allan, of Forres, who\r\nhas enjoyed the best means of observation, informs me in a letter that\r\nthe Holothuriæ (a family of Radiata) subsist on living coral; and the\r\nsingular structure of bone within the anterior extremity of their\r\nbodies, certainly appears well adapted for this purpose. The number of\r\nthe species of Holothuria, and of the individuals which swarm on every\r\npart of these coral-reefs, is extraordinarily great; and many shiploads\r\nare annually freighted, as is well-known, for China with the trepang,\r\nwhich is a species of this genus. The amount of coral yearly consumed,\r\nand ground down into the finest mud, by these several creatures, and\r\nprobably by many other kinds, must be immense. These facts are,\r\nhowever, of more importance in another point of view, as showing us\r\nthat there are living checks to the growth of coral-reefs, and that the\r\nalmost universal law of “consumed and be consumed,” holds good even\r\nwith the polypifers forming those massive bulwarks, which are able to\r\nwithstand the force of the open ocean.\r\n\r\nConsidering that Keeling atoll, like other coral formations, has been\r\nentirely formed by the growth of organic beings, and the accumulation\r\nof their detritus, one is naturally led to inquire how long it has\r\ncontinued, and how long it is likely to continue, in its present state.\r\nMr. Liesk informed me that he had seen an old chart in which the\r\npresent long island on the S.E. side was divided by several channels\r\ninto as many islets; and he assures me that the channels can still be\r\ndistinguished by the smaller size of the trees on them. On several\r\nislets, also, I observed that only young cocoa-nut trees were growing\r\non the extremities; and that older and taller trees rose in regular\r\nsuccession behind them; which shows that these islets have very lately\r\nincreased in length. In the upper and south-eastern part of the lagoon,\r\nI was much surprised by finding an irregular field of at least a mile\r\nsquare of branching corals, still upright, but entirely dead. They\r\nconsisted of the species already mentioned; they were of a brown\r\ncolour, and so rotten, that in trying to stand on them I sank halfway\r\nup the leg, as if through decayed brushwood. The tops of the branches\r\nwere barely covered by water at the time of lowest tide. Several facts\r\nhaving led me to disbelieve in any elevation of the whole atoll, I was\r\nat first unable to imagine what cause could have killed so large a\r\nfield of coral. Upon reflection, however, it appeared to me that the\r\nclosing up of the above-mentioned channels would be a sufficient cause;\r\nfor before this, a strong breeze by forcing water through them into the\r\nhead of the lagoon, would tend to raise its level. But now this cannot\r\nhappen, and the inhabitants observe that the tide rises to a less\r\nheight, during a high S.E. wind, at the head than at the mouth of the\r\nlagoon. The corals, which, under the former condition of things, had\r\nattained the utmost possible limit of upward growth, would thus\r\noccasionally be exposed for a short time to the sun, and be killed.\r\n\r\nBesides the increase of dry land, indicated by the foregoing facts, the\r\nexterior solid reef appears to have grown outwards. On the western side\r\nof the atoll, the “flat” lying between the margin of the reef and the\r\nbeach, is very wide; and in front of the regular beach with its\r\nconglomerate basis, there is, in most parts, a bed of sand and loose\r\nfragments with trees growing out of it, which apparently is not reached\r\neven by the spray at high water. It is evident some change has taken\r\nplace since the waves formed the inner beach; that they formerly beat\r\nagainst it with violence was evident, from a remarkably thick and\r\nwater-worn point of conglomerate at one spot, now protected by\r\nvegetation and a bank of sand; that they beat against it in the same\r\npeculiar manner in which the swell from windward now obliquely curls\r\nround the margin of the reef, was evident from the conglomerate having\r\nbeen worn into a point projecting from the beach in a similarly oblique\r\nmanner. This retreat in the line of action of the breakers might\r\nresult, either from the surface of the reef in front of the islets\r\nhaving been submerged at one time, and afterward having grown upwards,\r\nor from the mounds of coral on the margin having continued to grow\r\noutwards. That an outward growth of this part is in process, can hardly\r\nbe doubted from the fact already mentioned of the mounds of Porites\r\nwith their summits apparently lately killed, and their sides only three\r\nor four inches lower down thickened by a fresh layer of living coral.\r\nBut there is a difficulty on this supposition which I must not pass\r\nover. If the whole, or a large part of the “flat,” had been formed by\r\nthe outward growth of the margin, each successive margin would\r\nnaturally have been coated by the Nulliporæ, and so much of the surface\r\nwould have been of equal height with the existing zone of living\r\nNulliporæ: this is not the case, as may be seen in the woodcut. It is,\r\nhowever, evident from the abraded state of the “flat,” with its\r\noriginal inequalities filled up, that its surface has been much\r\nmodified; and it is possible that the hinder portions of the zone of\r\nNulliporæ, perishing as the reef grows outwards, might be worn down by\r\nthe surf. If this has not taken place, the reef can in no part have\r\nincreased outwards in breadth since its formation, or at least since\r\nthe Nulliporæ formed the convex mound on its margin; for the zone thus\r\nformed, and which stands between two and three feet above the other\r\nparts of the reef, is nowhere much above twenty yards in width.\r\n\r\nThus far we have considered facts, which indicate, with more or less\r\nprobability, the increase of the atoll in its different parts: there\r\nare others having an opposite tendency. On the south-east side,\r\nLieutenant Sulivan, to whose kindness I am indebted for many\r\ninteresting observations, found the conglomerate projecting on the reef\r\nnearly fifty yards in front of the beach: we may infer from what we see\r\nin all other parts of the atoll, that the conglomerate was not\r\noriginally so much exposed, but formed the base of an islet, the front\r\nand upper part of which has since been swept away. The degree to which\r\nthe conglomerate, round nearly the whole atoll, has been scooped,\r\nbroken up, and the fragments cast on the beach, is certainly very\r\nsurprising, even on the view that it is the office of occasional gales\r\nto pile up fragments, and of the daily tides to wear them away. On the\r\nwestern side, also, of the atoll, where I have described a bed of sand\r\nand fragments with trees growing out of it, in front of an old beach,\r\nit struck both Lieutenant Sulivan and myself, from the manner in which\r\nthe trees were being washed down, that the surf had lately recommenced\r\nan attack on this line of coast. Appearances indicating a slight\r\nencroachment of the water on the land, are plainer within the lagoon: I\r\nnoticed in several places, both on its windward and leeward shores, old\r\ncocoa-nut trees falling with their roots undermined, and the rotten\r\nstumps of others on the beach, where the inhabitants assured us the\r\ncocoa-nut could not now grow. Captain Fitzroy pointed out to me, near\r\nthe settlement, the foundation posts of a shed, now washed by every\r\ntide, but which the inhabitants stated, had seven years before stood\r\nabove high watermark. In the calm waters of the lagoon, directly\r\nconnected with a great, and therefore stable ocean, it seems very\r\nimprobable that a change in the currents, sufficiently great to cause\r\nthe water to eat into the land on all sides, should have taken place\r\nwithin a limited period. From these considerations I inferred, that\r\nprobably the atoll had lately subsided to a small amount; and this\r\ninference was strengthened by the circumstance, that in 1834, two years\r\nbefore our visit, the island had been shaken by a severe earthquake,\r\nand by two slighter ones during the ten previous years. If, during\r\nthese subterranean disturbances, the atoll did subside, the downward\r\nmovement must have been very small, as we must conclude from the fields\r\nof dead coral still lipping the surface of the lagoon, and from the\r\nbreakers on the western shore not having yet regained the line of their\r\nformer action. The subsidence must, also, have been preceded by a long\r\nperiod of rest, during which the islets extended to their present size,\r\nand the living margin of the reef grew either upwards, or as I believe\r\noutwards, to its present distance from the beach.\r\n\r\nWhether this view be correct or not, the above facts are worthy of\r\nattention, as showing how severe a struggle is in progress on these low\r\ncoral formations between the two nicely balanced powers of land and\r\nwater. With respect to the future state of Keeling atoll, if left\r\nundisturbed, we can see that the islets may still extend in length; but\r\nas they cannot resist the surf until broken by rolling over a wide\r\nspace, their increase in breadth must depend on the increasing breadth\r\nof the reef; and this must be limited by the steepness of the submarine\r\nflanks, which can be added to only by sediment derived from the wear\r\nand tear of the coral. From the rapid growth of the coral in the\r\nchannel cut for the schooner, and from the several agents at work in\r\nproducing fine sediment, it might be thought that the lagoon would\r\nnecessarily become quickly filled up. Some of this sediment, however,\r\nis transported into the open sea, as appears from the soundings off the\r\nmouth of the lagoon, instead of being deposited within it. The\r\ndeposition, moreover, of sediment, checks the growth of coral-reefs, so\r\nthat these two agencies cannot act together with full effect in filling\r\nit up. We know so little of the habits of the many different species of\r\ncorals, which form the lagoon-reefs, that we have no more reasons for\r\nsupposing that their whole surface would grow up as quickly as the\r\ncoral did in the schooner-channel, than for supposing that the whole\r\nsurface of a peat-moss would increase as quickly as parts are known to\r\ndo in holes, where the peat has been cut away. These agencies,\r\nnevertheless, tend to fill up the lagoon; but in proportion as it\r\nbecomes shallower, so must the polypifers be subject to many injurious\r\nagencies, such as impure water and loss of food. For instance, Mr.\r\nLiesk informed me, that some years before our visit unusually heavy\r\nrain killed nearly all the fish in the lagoon, and probably the same\r\ncause would likewise injure the corals. The reefs also, it must be\r\nremembered, cannot possibly rise above the level of the lowest\r\nspring-tide, so that the final conversion of the lagoon into land must\r\nbe due to the accumulation of sediment; and in the midst of the clear\r\nwater of the ocean, and with no surrounding high land, this process\r\nmust be exceedingly slow.\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF ATOLLS.\r\n\r\nGeneral form and size of atolls, their reefs and islets.—External\r\nslope.— Zone of Nulliporæ.—Conglomerate.—Depth of\r\nlagoons.—Sediment.—Reefs submerged wholly or in part.—Breaches in the\r\nreef.—Ledge-formed shores round certain lagoons.—Conversion of lagoons\r\ninto land.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will here give a sketch of the general form and structure of the many\r\natolls and atoll-formed reefs which occur in the Pacific and Indian\r\nOceans, comparing them with Keeling atoll. The Maldiva atolls and the\r\nGreat Chagos Bank differ in so many respects, that I shall devote to\r\nthem, besides occasional references, a third section of this chapter.\r\nKeeling atoll may be considered as of moderate dimensions and of\r\nregular form. Of the thirty-two islands surveyed by Captain Beechey in\r\nthe Low Archipelago, the longest was found to be thirty miles, and the\r\nshortest less than a mile; but Vliegen atoll, situated in another part\r\nof the same group, appears to be sixty miles long and twenty broad.\r\nMost of the atolls in this group are of an elongated form; thus Bow\r\nIsland is thirty miles in length, and on an average only six in width\r\n(See Figure 4, Plate I.), and Clermont Tonnere has nearly the same\r\nproportions. In the Marshall Archipelago (the Ralick and Radack group\r\nof Kotzebue) several of the atolls are more than thirty miles in\r\nlength, and Rimsky Korsacoff is fifty-four long, and twenty wide, at\r\nthe broadest part of its irregular outline. Most of the atolls in the\r\nMaldiva Archipelago are of great size, one of them (which, however,\r\nbears a double name) measured in a medial and slightly curved line, is\r\nno less than eighty-eight geographical miles long, its greatest width\r\nbeing under twenty, and its least only nine and a half miles. Some\r\natolls have spurs projecting from them; and in the Marshall group there\r\nare atolls united together by linear reefs, for instance Menchikoff\r\nIsland (See Figure 3, Plate II.), which is sixty miles in length, and\r\nconsists of three loops tied together. In far the greater number of\r\ncases an atoll consists of a simple elongated ring, with its outline\r\nmoderately regular.\r\n\r\nThe average width of the annular wreath may be taken as about a quarter\r\nof a mile. Captain Beechey[5] says that in the atolls of the Low\r\nArchipelago it exceeded in no instance half a mile. The description\r\ngiven of the structure and proportional dimensions of the reef and\r\nislets of Keeling atoll, appears to apply perfectly to nearly all the\r\natolls in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. The islets are first formed\r\nsome way back either on the projecting points of the reef, especially\r\nif its form be angular, or on the sides of the main entrances into the\r\nlagoon—that is in both cases, on points where the breakers can act\r\nduring gales of wind in somewhat different directions, so that the\r\nmatter thrown up from one side may accumulate against that before\r\nthrown up from another. In Lutké’s chart of the Caroline atolls, we see\r\nmany instances of the former case; and the occurrence of islets, as if\r\nplaced for beacons, on the points where there is a gateway or breach\r\nthrough the reef, has been noticed by several authors. There are some\r\natoll-formed reefs, rising to the surface of the sea and partly dry at\r\nlow water, on which from some cause islets have never been formed; and\r\nthere are others on which they have been formed, but have subsequently\r\nbeen worn away. In atolls of small dimensions the islets frequently\r\nbecome united into a single horse-shoe or ring-formed strip; but Diego\r\nGarcia, although an atoll of considerable size, being thirteen miles\r\nand a half in length, has its lagoon entirely surrounded, except at the\r\nnorthern end, by a belt of land, on an average a third of a mile in\r\nwidth. To show how small the total area of the annular reef and the\r\nland is in islands of this class, I may quote a remark from the voyage\r\nof Lutké, namely, that if the forty-three rings, or atolls, in the\r\nCaroline Archipelago, were put one within another, and over a steeple\r\nin the centre of St. Petersburg, the whole world would not cover that\r\ncity and its suburbs.\r\n\r\n [5] Beechey’s “Voyage to the Pacific and Beering’s Straits,” chapter\r\n viii.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe form of the bottom off Keeling atoll, which gradually slopes to\r\nabout twenty fathoms at the distance of between one and two hundred\r\nyards from the edge of the reef, and then plunges at an angle of 45°\r\ninto unfathomable depths, is exactly the same[6] with that of the\r\nsections of the atolls in the Low Archipelago given by Captain Beechey.\r\nThe nature, however, of the bottom seems to differ, for this officer[7]\r\ninforms me that all the soundings, even the deepest, were on coral, but\r\nhe does not know whether dead or alive. The slope round Christmas atoll\r\n(Lat. 1° 4′ N., 157° 45′ W.), described by Cook,[8] is considerably\r\nless, at about half a mile from the edge of the reef, the average depth\r\nwas about fourteen fathoms on a fine sandy bottom, and at a mile, only\r\nbetween twenty and forty fathoms. It has no doubt been owing to this\r\ngentle slope, that the strip of land surrounding its lagoon, has\r\nincreased in one part to the extraordinary width of three miles; it is\r\nformed of successive ridges of broken shells and corals, like those on\r\nthe beach. I know of no other instance of such width in the reef of an\r\natoll; but Mr. F.D. Bennett informs me that the inclination of the\r\nbottom round Caroline atoll in the Pacific, is like that off Christmas\r\nIsland, very gentle. Off the Maldiva and Chagos atolls, the inclination\r\nis much more abrupt; thus at Heawandoo Pholo, Lieutenant Powell[9]\r\nfound fifty and sixty fathoms close to the edge of the reef, and at 300\r\nyards distance there was no bottom with a 300-yard line. Captain\r\nMoresby informs me, that at 100 fathoms from the mouth of the lagoon of\r\nDiego Garcia, he found no bottom with 150 fathoms; this is the more\r\nremarkable, as the slope is generally less abrupt in front of channels\r\nthrough a reef, owing to the accumulation of sediment. At Egmont\r\nIsland, also, at 150 fathoms from the reef, soundings were struck with\r\n150 fathoms. Lastly, at Cardoo atoll, only sixty yards from the reef,\r\nno bottom was obtained, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, with a\r\nline of 200 fathoms! The currents run with great force round these\r\natolls, and where they are strongest, the inclination appears to be\r\nmost abrupt. I am informed by the same authority, that wherever\r\nsoundings were obtained off these islands, the bottom was invariably\r\nsandy: nor was there any reason to suspect the existence of submarine\r\ncliffs, as there was at Keeling Island.[10] Here then occurs a\r\ndifficulty; can sand accumulate on a slope, which, in some cases,\r\nappears to exceed fifty-five degrees? It must be observed, that I speak\r\nof slopes where soundings were obtained, and not of such cases, as that\r\nof Cardoo, where the nature of the bottom is unknown, and where its\r\ninclination must be nearly vertical. M. Élie de Beaumont[11] has\r\nargued, and there is no higher authority on this subject, from the\r\ninclination at which snow slides down in avalanches, that a bed of sand\r\nor mud cannot be formed at a greater angle than thirty degrees.\r\nConsidering the number of soundings on sand, obtained round the Maldiva\r\nand Chagos atolls, which appears to indicate a greater angle, and the\r\nextreme abruptness of the sand-banks in the West Indies, as will be\r\nmentioned in the Appendix, I must conclude that the adhesive property\r\nof wet sand counteracts its gravity, in a much greater ratio than has\r\nbeen allowed for by M. Élie de Beaumont. From the facility with which\r\ncalcareous sand becomes agglutinated, it is not necessary to suppose\r\nthat the bed of loose sand is thick.\r\n\r\n [6] The form of the bottom round the Marshall atolls in the Northern\r\n Pacific is probably similar: Kotzebue (“First Voyage,” volume ii.,\r\n page 16.) says: “We had at a small distance from the reef, forty\r\n fathoms depth, which increased a little further so much that we could\r\n find no bottom.”)\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] I must be permitted to express my obligation to Captain Beechey,\r\n for the very kind manner in which he has given me information on\r\n several points, and to own the great assistance I have derived from\r\n his excellent published work.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] Cook’s “Third Voyage,” volume ii., chapter 10.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] This fact is taken from a MS. account of these groups lent me by\r\n Captain Moresby. See also Captain Moresby’s paper on the Maldiva\r\n atolls in the “Geographical Journal”, volume v., page 401.\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] Off some of the islands in the Low Archipelago the bottom appears\r\n to descend by ledges. Off Elizabeth Island, which, however, consists\r\n of raised coral, Captain Beechey (p. 45, quarto edition) describes\r\n three ledges: the first had an easy slope from the beach to a distance\r\n of about fifty yards: the second extended two hundred yards with\r\n twenty-five fathoms on it, and then ended abruptly, like the first;\r\n and immediately beyond this there was no bottom with two hundred\r\n fathoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] “Mémoires pour servir à une description Géolog. de France,” tome\r\n iv., page 216.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Beechey has observed, that the submarine slope is much less at\r\nthe extremities of the more elongated atolls in the Low Archipelago,\r\nthan at their sides; in speaking of Ducie’s Island he says[12] the\r\nbuttress, as it may be called, which “has the most powerful enemy (the\r\nS.W. swell) to oppose, is carried out much further, and with less\r\nabruptness than the other.” In some cases, the less inclination of a\r\ncertain part of the external slope, for instance of the northern\r\nextremities of the two Keeling atolls, is caused by a prevailing\r\ncurrent which there accumulates a bed of sand. Where the water is\r\nperfectly tranquil, as within a lagoon, the reefs generally grow up\r\nperpendicularly, and sometimes even overhang their bases; on the other\r\nhand, on the leeward side of Mauritius, where the water is generally\r\ntranquil, although not invariably so, the reef is very gently inclined.\r\nHence it appears that the exterior angle varies much; nevertheless in\r\nthe close similarity in form between the sections of Keeling atoll and\r\nof the atolls in the Low Archipelago, in the general steepness of the\r\nreefs of the Maldiva and Chagos atolls, and in the perpendicularity of\r\nthose rising out of water always tranquil, we may discern the effects\r\nof uniform laws; but from the complex action of the surf and currents,\r\non the growing powers of the coral and on the deposition of sediment,\r\nwe can by no means follow out all the results.\r\n\r\n [12] Beechey’s “Voyage,” 4to edition, page 44.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere islets have been formed on the reef, that part which I have\r\nsometimes called the “flat” and which is partly dry at low water,\r\nappears similar in every atoll. In the Marshall group in the North\r\nPacific, it may be inferred from Chamisso’s description, that the reef,\r\nwhere islets have not been formed on it, slopes gently from the\r\nexternal margin to the shores of the lagoon; Flinders states that the\r\nAustralian barrier has a similar inclination inwards, and I have no\r\ndoubt it is of general occurrence, although, according to Ehrenberg,\r\nthe reefs of the Red Sea offer an exception. Chamisso observes that\r\n“the red colour of the reef (at the Marshall atolls) under the breakers\r\nis caused by a Nullipora, which covers the stone _wherever the waves\r\nbeat;_ and, under favourable circumstances, assumes a stalactical\r\nform,”—a description perfectly applicable to the margin of Keeling\r\natoll.[13] Although Chamisso does not state that the masses of\r\nNulliporæ form points or a mound, higher than the flat, yet I believe\r\nthat this is the case; for Kotzebue,[14] in another part, speaks of the\r\nrocks on the edge of the reef “as visible for about two feet at low\r\nwater,” and these rocks we may feel quite certain are not formed of\r\ntrue coral.[15] Whether a smooth convex mound of Nulliporæ, like that\r\nwhich appears as if artificially constructed to protect the margin of\r\nKeeling Island, is of frequent occurrence round atolls, I know not; but\r\nwe shall presently meet with it, under precisely the same form, on the\r\nouter edge of the “barrier-reefs” which encircle the Society Islands.\r\n\r\n [13] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” volume iii., page 142. Near Porto\r\n Praya, in the Cape de Verde Islands, some basaltic rocks, lashed by no\r\n inconsiderable surf, were completely enveloped with a layer of\r\n Nulliporæ. The entire surface over many square inches, was coloured of\r\n a peach-blossomed red; the layer, however, was of no greater thickness\r\n than paper. Another kind, in the form of projecting knobs, grew in the\r\n same situation. These Nulliporæ are closely related to those described\r\n on the coral-reefs, but I believe are of different species.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] Kotzebue, “First Voyage,” volume ii., page 16. Lieutenant Nelson,\r\n in his excellent memoir in the Geological Transactions (volume ii.,\r\n page 105), alludes to the rocky points mentioned by Kotzebue, and\r\n infers that they consist of Serpulæ, which compose incrusting masses\r\n on the reefs of Bermudas, as they likewise do on a sandstone bar off\r\n the coast of Brazil (which I have described in “London Phil. Journal,”\r\n October 1841). These masses of Serpulæ hold the same position,\r\n relatively to the action of the sea, with the Nulliporæ on the\r\n coral-reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] Captain Moresby, in his valuable paper “on the Northern atolls of\r\n Maldivas” (“Geographical Journal”, volume v.), says that the edges of\r\n the reefs there stand above water at low spring-tides.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere appears to be scarcely a feature in the structure of Keeling\r\nreef, which is not of common, if not of universal occurrence, in other\r\natolls. Thus Chamisso describes[16] a layer of coarse conglomerate,\r\noutside the islets round the Marshall atolls which “appears on its\r\nupper surface uneven and eaten away.” From drawings, with appended\r\nremarks, of Diego Garcia in the Chagos group and of several of the\r\nMaldiva atolls, shown me by Captain Moresby,[17] it is evident that\r\ntheir outer coasts are subject to the same round of decay and\r\nrenovation as those of Keeling atoll. From the description of the\r\natolls in the Low Archipelago, given in Captain Beechey’s “Voyage,” it\r\nis not apparent that any conglomerate coral-rock was there observed.\r\n\r\n [16] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” volume iii., page 144.\r\n\r\n\r\n [17] See also Moresby on the Northern atolls of the Maldivas,\r\n “Geographical Journal”, volume v., page 400.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lagoon in Keeling atoll is shallow; in the atolls of the Low\r\nArchipelago the depth varies from 20 to 38 fathoms, and in the Marshall\r\nGroup, according to Chamisso, from 30 to 35; in the Caroline atolls it\r\nis only a little less. Within the Maldiva atolls there are large spaces\r\nwith 45 fathoms, and some soundings are laid down of 49 fathoms. The\r\ngreater part of the bottom in most lagoons, is formed of sediment;\r\nlarge spaces have exactly the same depth, or the depth varies so\r\ninsensibly, that it is evident that no other means, excepting aqueous\r\ndeposition, could have leveled the surface so equally. In the Maldiva\r\natolls this is very conspicuous, and likewise in some of the Caroline\r\nand Marshall Islands. In the former large spaces consist of sand and\r\n_soft clay;_ and Kotzebue speaks of clay having been found within one\r\nof the Marshall atolls. No doubt this clay is calcareous mud, similar\r\nto that at Keeling Island, and to that at Bermuda already referred to,\r\nas undistinguishable from disintegrated chalk, and which Lieutenant\r\nNelson says is called there pipe-clay.[18]\r\n\r\n [18] I may here observe that on the coast of Brazil, where there is\r\n much coral, the soundings near the land are described by Admiral\r\n Roussin, in the _Pilote du Brésil_, as siliceous sand, mingled with\r\n much finely comminuted particles of shells and coral. Further in the\r\n offing, for a space of 1,300 miles along the coast, from the Abrolhos\r\n Islands to Maranham, the bottom in many places is composed of “tuf\r\n blanc, mêlé ou formé de madrépores broyés.” This white substance,\r\n probably, is analogous to that which occurs within the above-mentioned\r\n lagoons; it is sometimes, according to Roussin, firm, and he compares\r\n it to mortar.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the waves act with unequal force on the two sides of an atoll,\r\nthe islets appear to be first formed, and are generally of greater\r\ncontinuity on the more exposed shore. The islets, also, which are\r\nplaced to leeward, are in most parts of the Pacific liable to be\r\noccasionally swept entirely away by gales, equalling hurricanes in\r\nviolence, which blow in an opposite direction to the ordinary\r\ntrade-wind. The absence of the islets on the leeward side of atolls, or\r\nwhen present their lesser dimensions compared with those to windward,\r\nis a comparatively unimportant fact; but in several instances the reef\r\nitself on the leeward side, retaining its usual defined outline, does\r\nnot rise to the surface by several fathoms. This is the case with the\r\nsouthern side of Peros Banhos (Plate I., Figure 9) in the Chagos group,\r\nwith Mourileu atoll[19] in the Caroline Archipelago, and with the\r\nbarrier-reef (Plate I., Figure 8) of the Gambier Islands. I allude to\r\nthe latter reef, although belonging to another class, because Captain\r\nBeechey was first led by it to observe the peculiarity in the question.\r\nAt Peros Banhos the submerged part is nine miles in length, and lies at\r\nan average depth of about five fathoms; its surface is nearly level,\r\nand consists of hard stone, with a thin covering of loose sand. There\r\nis scarcely any living coral on it, even on the outer margin, as I have\r\nbeen particularly assured by Captain Moresby; it is, in fact, a wall of\r\ndead coral-rock, having the same width and transverse section with the\r\nreef in its ordinary state, of which it is a continuous portion. The\r\nliving and perfect parts terminate abruptly, and abut on the submerged\r\nportions, in the same manner as on the sides of an ordinary passage\r\nthrough the reef. The reef to leeward in other cases is nearly or quite\r\nobliterated, and one side of the lagoon is left open; for instance, at\r\nOulleay (Caroline Archipelago), where a crescent-formed reef is fronted\r\nby an irregular bank, on which the other half of the annular reef\r\nprobably once stood. At Namonouïto, in the same Archipelago, both these\r\nmodifications of the reef concur; it consists of a great flat bank,\r\nwith from twenty to twenty-five fathoms water on it; for a length of\r\nmore than forty miles on its southern side it is open and without any\r\nreef, whilst on the other sides it is bounded by a reef, in parts\r\nrising to the surface and perfectly characterised, in parts lying some\r\nfathoms submerged. In the Chagos group there are annular reefs,\r\nentirely submerged, which have the same structure as the submerged and\r\ndefined portions just described. The Speaker’s Bank offers an excellent\r\nexample of this structure; its central expanse, which is about\r\ntwenty-two fathoms deep, is twenty-four miles across; the external rim\r\nis of the usual width of annular reefs, and is well-defined; it lies\r\nbetween six and eight fathoms beneath the surface, and at the same\r\ndepth there are scattered knolls in the lagoon. Captain Moresby\r\nbelieves the rim consists of dead rock, thinly covered with sand, and\r\nhe is certain this is the case with the external rim of the Great\r\nChagos Bank, which is also essentially a submerged atoll. In both these\r\ncases, as in the submerged portion of the reef at Peros Banhos, Captain\r\nMoresby feels sure that the quantity of living coral, even on the outer\r\nedge overhanging the deep-sea water, is quite insignificant. Lastly, in\r\nseveral parts of the Pacific and Indian Oceans there are banks, lying\r\nat greater depths than in the cases just mentioned, of the same form\r\nand size with the neighbouring atolls, but with their atoll-like\r\nstructure wholly obliterated. It appears from the survey of Freycinet,\r\nthat there are banks of this kind in the Caroline Archipelago, and, as\r\nis reported, in the Low Archipelago. When we discuss the origin of the\r\ndifferent classes of coral formations, we shall see that the submerged\r\nstate of the whole of some atoll-formed reefs, and of portions of\r\nothers, generally but not invariably on the leeward side, and the\r\nexistence of more deeply submerged banks now possessing little or no\r\nsigns of their original atoll-like structure, are probably the effects\r\nof a uniform cause,—namely, the death of the coral, during the\r\nsubsidence of the area, in which the atolls or banks are situated.\r\n\r\n [19] Frederick Lutké’s “Voyage autour du Monde,” volume ii., page 291.\r\n See also his account of Namonouïto, below, and the chart of Oulleay in\r\n the Atlas.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is seldom, with the exception of the Maldiva atolls, more than\r\ntwo or three channels, and generally only one leading into the lagoon,\r\nof sufficient depth for a ship to enter. in small atolls, there is\r\nusually not even one. Where there is deep water, for instance above\r\ntwenty fathoms, in the middle of the lagoon, the channels through the\r\nreef are seldom as deep as the centre,—it may be said that the rim only\r\nof the saucer-shaped hollow forming the lagoon is notched. Mr.\r\nLyell[20] has observed that the growth of the coral would tend to\r\nobstruct all the channels through a reef, except those kept open by\r\ndischarging the water, which during high tide and the greater part of\r\neach ebb is thrown over its circumference. Several facts indicate that\r\na considerable quantity of sediment is likewise discharged through\r\nthese channels; and Captain Moresby informs me that he has observed,\r\nduring the change of the monsoon, the sea discoloured to a distance off\r\nthe entrances into the Maldiva and Chagos atolls. This, probably, would\r\ncheck the growth of the coral in them, far more effectually than a mere\r\ncurrent of water. In the many small atolls without any channel, these\r\ncauses have not prevented the entire ring attaining the surface. The\r\nchannels, like the submerged and effaced parts of the reef, very\r\ngenerally though not invariably occur on the leeward side of the atoll,\r\nor on that side, according to Beechey,[21] which, from running in the\r\nsame direction with the prevalent wind, is not fully exposed to it.\r\nPassages between the islets on the reef, through which boats can pass\r\nat high water, must not be confounded with ship-channels, by which the\r\nannular reef itself is breached. The passages between the islets occur,\r\nof course, on the windward as well as on the leeward side; but they are\r\nmore frequent and broader to leeward, owing to the lesser dimensions of\r\nthe islets on that side.\r\n\r\n [20] “Principles of Geology,” volume iii., page 289.\r\n\r\n\r\n [21] Beechey’s “Voyage,” 4to edition, volume i., page 189.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Keeling atoll the shores of the lagoon shelve gradually, where the\r\nbottom is of sediment, and irregularly or abruptly where there are\r\ncoral-reefs; but this is by no means the universal structure in other\r\natolls. Chamisso,[22] speaking in general terms of the lagoons in the\r\nMarshall atolls, says the lead generally sinks “from a depth of two or\r\nthree fathoms to twenty or twenty-four, and you may pursue a line in\r\nwhich on one side of the boat you may see the bottom, and on the other\r\nthe azure-blue deep water.” The shores of the lagoon-like channel\r\nwithin the barrier-reef at Vanikoro have a similar structure. Captain\r\nBeechey has described a modification of this structure (and he believes\r\nit is not uncommon) in two atolls in the Low Archipelago, in which the\r\nshores of the lagoon descend by a few, broad, slightly inclined ledges\r\nor steps: thus at Matilda atoll,[23] the great exterior reef, the\r\nsurface of which is gently inclined towards and beneath the surface of\r\nthe lagoon, ends abruptly in a little cliff three fathoms deep; at its\r\nfoot, a ledge forty yards wide extends, shelving gently inwards like\r\nthe surface-reef, and terminated by a second little cliff five fathoms\r\ndeep; beyond this, the bottom of the lagoon slopes to twenty fathoms,\r\nwhich is the average depth of its centre. These ledges seem to be\r\nformed of coral-rock; and Captain Beechey says that the lead often\r\ndescended several fathoms through holes in them. In some atolls, all\r\nthe coral reefs or knolls in the lagoon come to the surface at low\r\nwater; in other cases of rarer occurrence, all lie at nearly the same\r\ndepth beneath it, but most frequently they are quite irregular,—some\r\nwith perpendicular, some with sloping sides,—some rising to the\r\nsurface, and others lying at all intermediate depths from the bottom\r\nupwards. I cannot, therefore, suppose that the union of such reefs\r\ncould produce even one uniformly sloping ledge, and much less two or\r\nthree, one beneath the other, and each terminated by an abrupt wall. At\r\nMatilda Island, which offers the best example of the step-like\r\nstructure, Captain Beechey observes that the coral-knolls within the\r\nlagoon are quite irregular in their height. We shall hereafter see that\r\nthe theory which accounts for the ordinary form of atolls, apparently\r\nincludes this occasional peculiarity in their structure.\r\n\r\n [22] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” volume iii., page 142.\r\n\r\n\r\n [23] Beechey’s “Voyage,” 4to edition, volume i, page 160. At\r\n Whitsunday Island the bottom of the lagoon slopes gradually towards\r\n the centre, and then deepens suddenly, the edge of the bank being\r\n nearly perpendicular. This bank is formed of coral and dead shells.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a group of atolls, there sometimes occur small, flat,\r\nvery low islands of coral formation, which probably once included a\r\nlagoon, since filled up with sediment and coral-reefs. Captain Beechey\r\nentertains no doubt that this has been the case with the two small\r\nislands, which alone of thirty-one surveyed by him in the Low\r\nArchipelago, did not contain lagoons. Romanzoff Island (in lat. 15° S.)\r\nis described by Chamisso[24]\r\nas formed by a dam of madreporitic rock inclosing a flat space, thinly\r\ncovered with trees, into which the sea on the leeward side occasionally\r\nbreaks. North Keeling atoll appears to be in a rather less forward\r\nstage of conversion into land; it consists of a horse-shoe shaped strip\r\nof land surrounding a muddy flat, one mile in its longest axis, which\r\nis covered by the sea only at high water. When describing South Keeling\r\natoll, I endeavoured to show how slow the final process of filling up a\r\nlagoon must be; nevertheless, as all causes do tend to produce this\r\neffect, it is very remarkable that not one instance, as I believe, is\r\nknown of a moderately sized lagoon being filled up even to the low\r\nwater-line at spring-tides, much less of such a one being converted\r\ninto land. It is, likewise, in some degree remarkable, how few atolls,\r\nexcept small ones, are surrounded by a single linear strip of land,\r\nformed by the union of separate islets. We cannot suppose that the many\r\natolls in the Pacific and Indian Oceans all have had a late origin, and\r\nyet should they remain at their present level, subjected only to the\r\naction of the sea and to the growing powers of the coral, during as\r\nmany centuries as must have elapsed since any of the earlier tertiary\r\nepochs, it cannot, I think, be doubted that their lagoons and the\r\nislets on their reef, would present a totally different appearance from\r\nwhat they now do. This consideration leads to the suspicion that some\r\nrenovating agency (namely subsidence) comes into play at intervals, and\r\nperpetuates their original structure.\r\n\r\n [24] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” volume iii., page 221.\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—ATOLLS OF THE MALDIVA ARCHIPELAGO—GREAT CHAGOS BANK.\r\n\r\nMaldiva Archipelago.—Ring-formed reefs, marginal and central.—Great\r\ndepths in the lagoons of the southern atolls.—Reefs in the lagoons all\r\nrising to the surface.—Position of islets and breaches in the reefs,\r\nwith respect to the prevalent winds and action of the\r\nwaves.—Destruction of islets.—Connection in the position and submarine\r\nfoundation of distinct atolls.—The apparent disseverment of large\r\natolls.—The Great Chagos Bank.—Its submerged condition and\r\nextraordinary structure.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough occasional references have been made to the Maldiva atolls,\r\nand to the banks in the Chagos group, some points of their structure\r\ndeserve further consideration. My description is derived from an\r\nexamination of the admirable charts lately published from the survey of\r\nCaptain Moresby and Lieutenant Powell, and more especially from\r\ninformation which Captain Moresby has communicated to me in the kindest\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThe Maldiva Archipelago is 470 miles in length, with an average breadth\r\nof about 50 miles. The form and dimensions of the atolls, and their\r\nsingular position in a double line, may be seen, but not well, in the\r\ngreatly reduced chart (Figure 6) in Plate II. The dimensions of the\r\nlongest atoll in the group (called by the double name of\r\nMilla-dou-Madou and Tilla-dou-Matte) have already been given; it is 88\r\nmiles in a medial and slightly curved line, and is less than 20 miles\r\nin its broadest part. Suadiva, also, is a noble atoll, being 44 miles\r\nacross in one direction, and 34 in another, and the great included\r\nexpanse of water has a depth of between 250 and 300 feet. The smaller\r\natolls in this group differ in no respect from ordinary ones; but the\r\nlarger ones are remarkable from being breached by numerous deep-water\r\nchannels leading into the lagoon; for instance, there are 42 channels,\r\nthrough which a ship could enter the lagoon of Suadiva. In the three\r\nsouthern large atolls, the separate portions of reef between these\r\nchannels have the ordinary structure, and are linear; but in the other\r\natolls, especially the more northern ones, these portions are ring-\r\nformed, like miniature atolls. Other ring-formed reefs rise out of the\r\nlagoons, in the place of those irregular ones which ordinarily occur\r\nthere. In the reduction of the chart of Mahlos Mahdoo (Plate II.,\r\nFigure 4), it was not found easy to define the islets and the little\r\nlagoons within each reef, so that the ring-formed structure is very\r\nimperfectly shown; in the large published charts of Tilla-dou-Matte,\r\nthe appearance of these rings, from standing further apart from each\r\nother, is very remarkable. The rings on the margin are generally\r\nelongated; many of them are three, and some even five miles, in\r\ndiameter; those within the lagoon are usually smaller, few being more\r\nthan two miles across, and the greater number rather less than one. The\r\ndepth of the little lagoon within these small annular reefs is\r\ngenerally from five to seven fathoms, but occasionally more; and in Ari\r\natoll many of the central ones are twelve, and some even more than\r\ntwelve fathoms deep. These rings rise abruptly from the platform or\r\nbank, on which they are placed; their outer margin is invariably\r\nbordered by living coral[25] within which there is a flat surface of\r\ncoral rock; of this flat, sand and fragments have in many cases\r\naccumulated and been converted into islets, clothed with vegetation. I\r\ncan, in fact, point out no essential difference between these little\r\nring-formed reefs (which, however, are larger, and contain deeper\r\nlagoons than many true atolls that stand in the open sea), and the most\r\nperfectly characterised atolls, excepting that the ring-formed reefs\r\nare based on a shallow foundation, instead of on the floor of the open\r\nsea, and that instead of being scattered irregularly, they are grouped\r\nclosely together on one large platform, with the marginal rings\r\narranged in a rudely formed circle.\r\n\r\n [25] Captain Moresby informs me that _Millepora complanata_ is one of\r\n the commonest kinds on the outer margin, as it is at Keeling atoll.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe perfect series which can be traced from portions of simple linear\r\nreef, to others including long linear lagoons, and from these again to\r\noval or almost circular rings, renders it probable that the latter are\r\nmerely modifications of the linear or normal state. It is conformable\r\nwith this view, that the ring-formed reefs on the margin, even where\r\nmost perfect and standing furthest apart, generally have their longest\r\naxes directed in the line which the reef would have held, if the atoll\r\nhad been bounded by an ordinary wall. We may also infer that the\r\ncentral ring-formed reefs are modifications of those irregular ones,\r\nwhich are found in the lagoons of all common atolls. It appears from\r\nthe charts on a large scale, that the ring-like structure is contingent\r\non the marginal channels or breaches being wide; and, consequently, on\r\nthe whole interior of the atoll being freely exposed to the waters of\r\nthe open sea. When the channels are narrow or few in number, although\r\nthe lagoon be of great size and depth (as in Suadiva), there are no\r\nring-formed reefs; where the channels are somewhat broader, the\r\nmarginal portions of reef, and especially those close to the larger\r\nchannels, are ring-formed, but the central ones are not so; where they\r\nare broadest, almost every reef throughout the atoll is more or less\r\nperfectly ring-formed. Although their presence is thus contingent on\r\nthe openness of the marginal channels, the theory of their formation,\r\nas we shall hereafter see, is included in that of the parent atolls, of\r\nwhich they form the separate portions.\r\n\r\nThe lagoons of all the atolls in the southern part of the Archipelago\r\nare from ten to twenty fathoms deeper than those in the northern part.\r\nThis is well exemplified in the case of Addoo, the southernmost atoll\r\nin the group, for although only nine miles in its longest diameter, it\r\nhas a depth of thirty-nine fathoms, whereas all the other small atolls\r\nhave comparatively shallow lagoons; I can assign no adequate cause for\r\nthis difference in depth. In the central and deepest part of the\r\nlagoons, the bottom consists, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, of\r\nstiff clay (probably a calcareous mud); nearer the border it consists\r\nof sand, and in the channels through the reef, of hard sand-banks,\r\nsandstone, conglomerate rubble, and a little live coral. Close outside\r\nthe reef and the line joining its detached portions (where intersected\r\nby many channels), the bottom is sandy, and it slopes abruptly into\r\nunfathomable depths. In most lagoons the depth is considerably greater\r\nin the centre than in the channels; but in Tilla-dou-Matte, where the\r\nmarginal ring-formed reefs stand far apart, the same depth is carried\r\nacross the entire atoll, from the deep-water line on one side to that\r\non the other. I cannot refrain from once again remarking on the\r\nsingularity of these atolls,—a great sandy and generally concave disc\r\nrises abruptly from the unfathomable ocean, with its central expanse\r\nstudded and its border symmetrically fringed with oval basins of\r\ncoral-rock, just lipping the surface of the sea, sometimes clothed with\r\nvegetation, and each containing a little lake of clear water!\r\n\r\nIn the southern Maldiva atolls, of which there are nine large ones, all\r\nthe small reefs within the lagoons come to the surface, and are dry at\r\nlow water spring-tides; hence in navigating them, there is no danger\r\nfrom submarine banks. This circumstance is very remarkable, as within\r\nsome atolls, for instance those of the neighbouring Chagos group, not a\r\nsingle reef comes to the surface, and in most other cases a few only\r\ndo, and the rest lie at all intermediate depths from the bottom\r\nupwards. When treating of the growth of coral I shall again refer to\r\nthis subject.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the neighbourhood of the Maldiva Archipelago the winds,\r\nduring the monsoons, blow during nearly an equal time from opposite\r\nquarters, and although, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, the\r\nwesterly winds are the strongest, yet the islets are almost all placed\r\non the eastern side of the northern atolls, and on the south-eastern\r\nside of the southern atolls. That the formation of the islets is due to\r\ndetritus thrown up from the outside, as in the ordinary manner, and not\r\nfrom the interior of the lagoons, may, I think be safely inferred from\r\nseveral considerations, which it is hardly worth while to detail. As\r\nthe easterly winds are not the strongest, their action probably is\r\naided by some prevailing swell or current.\r\n\r\nIn groups of atolls, exposed to a trade-wind, the ship-channels into\r\nthe lagoons are almost invariably situated on the leeward or less\r\nexposed side of the reef, and the reef itself is sometimes either\r\nwanting there, or is submerged. A strictly analogous, but different\r\nfact, may be observed at the Maldiva atolls—namely, that where two\r\natolls stand in front of each other, the breaches in the reef are the\r\nmost numerous on their near, and therefore less exposed, sides. Thus on\r\nthe near sides of Ari and the two Nillandoo atolls, which face S. Māle,\r\nPhaleedoo, and Moloque atolls, there are seventy-three deep-water\r\nchannels, and only twenty-five on their outer sides; on the near side\r\nof the three latter named atolls there are fifty- six openings, and\r\nonly thirty-seven on their outsides. It is scarcely possible to\r\nattribute this difference to any other cause than the somewhat\r\ndifferent action of the sea on the two sides, which would ensue from\r\nthe protection afforded by the two rows of atolls to each other. I may\r\nhere remark that in most cases, the conditions favourable to the\r\ngreater accumulation of fragments on the reef and to its more perfect\r\ncontinuity on one side of the atoll than on the other, have concurred,\r\nbut this has not been the case with the Maldivas; for we have seen that\r\nthe islets are placed on the eastern or south-eastern sides, whilst the\r\nbreaches in the reef occur indifferently on any side, where protected\r\nby an opposite atoll. The reef being more continuous on the outer and\r\nmore exposed sides of those atolls which stand near each other, accords\r\nwith the fact, that the reef of the southern atolls is more continuous\r\nthan that of the northern ones; for the former, as I am informed by\r\nCaptain Moresby, are more constantly exposed than the northern atolls\r\nto a heavy surf.\r\n\r\nThe date of the first formation of some of the islets in this\r\nArchipelago is known to the inhabitants; on the other hand, several\r\nislets, and even some of those which are believed to be very old, are\r\nnow fast wearing away. The work of destruction has, in some instances,\r\nbeen completed in ten years. Captain Moresby found on one water-washed\r\nreef the marks of wells and graves, which were excavated when it\r\nsupported an islet. In South Nillandoo atoll, the natives say that\r\nthree of the islets were formerly larger: in North Nillandoo there is\r\none now being washed away; and in this latter atoll Lieutenant Prentice\r\nfound a reef, about six hundred yards in diameter, which the natives\r\npositively affirmed was lately an island covered with cocoa-nut trees.\r\nIt is now only partially dry at low water spring-tides, and is (in\r\nLieutenant Prentice’s words) “entirely covered with live coral and\r\nmadrepore.” In the northern part, also, of the Maldiva Archipelago and\r\nin the Chagos group, it is known that some of the islets are\r\ndisappearing. The natives attribute these effects to variations in the\r\ncurrents of the sea. For my own part I cannot avoid suspecting that\r\nthere must be some further cause, which gives rise to such a cycle of\r\nchange in the action of the currents of the great and open ocean.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the atolls in this Archipelago are so related to each other\r\nin form and position, that at the first glance one is led to suspect\r\nthat they have originated in the disseverment of a single one. Māle\r\nconsists of three perfectly characterised atolls, of which the shape\r\nand relative position are such, that a line drawn closely round all\r\nthree, gives a symmetrical figure; to see this clearly, a larger chart\r\nis required than that of the Archipelago in Plate II.; the channel\r\nseparating the two northern Māle atolls is only little more than a mile\r\nwide, and no bottom was found in it with 100 fathoms. Powell’s Island\r\nis situated at the distance of two miles and a half off the northern\r\nend of Mahlos Mahdoo (see Figure 4, Plate II.), at the exact point\r\nwhere the two sides of the latter, if prolonged, would meet; no bottom,\r\nhowever, was found in the channel with 200 fathoms; in the wider\r\nchannel between Horsburgh atoll and the southern end of Mahlos Mahdoo,\r\nno bottom was found with 250 fathoms. In these and similar cases, the\r\nrelation consists only in the form and position of the atolls. But in\r\nthe channel between the two Nillandoo atolls, although three miles and\r\na quarter wide, soundings were struck at the depth of 200 fathoms; the\r\nchannel between Ross and Ari atolls is four miles wide, and only 150\r\nfathoms deep. Here then we have, besides the relation of form, a\r\nsubmarine connection. The fact of soundings having been obtained\r\nbetween two separate and perfectly characterised atolls is in itself\r\ninteresting, as it has never, I believe, been effected in any of the\r\nmany other groups of atolls in the Pacific and Indian seas. In\r\ncontinuing to trace the connection of adjoining atolls, if a hasty\r\nglance be taken at the chart (Figure 4., Plate II.) of Mahlos Mahdoo,\r\nand the line of unfathomable water be followed, no one will hesitate to\r\nconsider it as one atoll. But a second look will show that it is\r\ndivided by a bifurcating channel, of which the northern arm is about\r\none mile and three-quarters in width, with an average depth of 125\r\nfathoms, and the southern one three-quarters of a mile wide, and rather\r\nless deep. These channels resemble in the slope of their sides and\r\ngeneral form, those which separate atolls in every respect distinct;\r\nand the northern arm is wider than that dividing two of the Māle\r\natolls. The ring-formed reefs on the sides of this bifurcating channel\r\nare elongated, so that the northern and southern portions of Mahlos\r\nMahdoo may claim, as far as their external outline is concerned, to be\r\nconsidered as distinct and perfect atolls. But the intermediate\r\nportion, lying in the fork of the channel, is bordered by reefs less\r\nperfect than those which surround any other atoll in the group of\r\nequally small dimensions. Mahlos Mahdoo, therefore, is in every respect\r\nin so intermediate a condition, that it may be considered either as a\r\nsingle atoll nearly dissevered into three portions, or as three atolls\r\nalmost perfect and intimately connected. This is an instance of a very\r\nearly stage of the apparent disseverment of an atoll, but a still\r\nearlier one in many respects is exhibited at Tilla-dou- Matte. In one\r\npart of this atoll, the ring-formed reefs stand so far apart from each\r\nother, that the inhabitants have given different names to the northern\r\nand southern halves; nearly all the rings, moreover, are so perfect and\r\nstand so separate, and the space from which they rise is so level and\r\nunlike a true lagoon, that we can easily imagine the conversion of this\r\none great atoll, not into two or three portions, but into a whole group\r\nof miniature atolls. A perfect series such as we have here traced,\r\nimpresses the mind with an idea of actual change; and it will hereafter\r\nbe seen, that the theory of subsidence, with the upward growth of the\r\ncoral, modified by accidents of probable occurrence, will account for\r\nthe occasional disseverment of large atolls.\r\n\r\nThe Great Chagos bank alone remains to be described. In the Chagos\r\ngroup there are some ordinary atolls, some annular reefs rising to the\r\nsurface but without any islets on them, and some atoll-formed banks,\r\neither quite submerged, or nearly so. Of the latter, the Great Chagos\r\nBank is much the largest, and differs in its structure from the others:\r\na plan of it is given in Plate II., Figure 1, in which, for the sake of\r\nclearness, I have had the parts under ten fathoms deep finely shaded:\r\nan east and west vertical section is given in Figure 2, in which the\r\nvertical scale has been necessarily exaggerated. Its longest axis is\r\nninety nautical miles, and another line drawn at right angles to the\r\nfirst, across the broadest part, is seventy. The central part consists\r\nof a level muddy flat, between forty and fifty fathoms deep, which is\r\nsurrounded on all sides, with the exception of some breaches, by the\r\nsteep edges of a set of banks, rudely arranged in a circle. These banks\r\nconsist of sand, with a very little live coral; they vary in breadth\r\nfrom five to twelve miles, and on an average lie about sixteen fathoms\r\nbeneath the surface; they are bordered by the steep edges of a third\r\nnarrow and upper bank, which forms the rim to the whole. This rim is\r\nabout a mile in width, and with the exception of two or three spots\r\nwhere islets have been formed, is submerged between five and ten\r\nfathoms. It consists of smooth hard rock, covered with a thin layer of\r\nsand, but with scarcely any live coral; it is steep on both sides, and\r\noutwards slopes abruptly into unfathomable depths. At the distance of\r\nless than half a mile from one part, no bottom was found with 190\r\nfathoms; and off another point, at a somewhat greater distance, there\r\nwas none with 210 fathoms. Small steep-sided banks or knolls, covered\r\nwith luxuriantly growing coral, rise from the interior expanse to the\r\nsame level with the external rim, which, as we have seen, is formed\r\nonly of dead rock. It is impossible to look at the plan (Figure 1,\r\nPlate II.), although reduced to so small a scale, without at once\r\nperceiving that the Great Chagos Bank is, in the words of Captain\r\nMoresby,[26] “nothing more than a half-drowned atoll.” But of what\r\ngreat dimensions, and of how extraordinary an internal structure? We\r\nshall hereafter have to consider both the cause of its submerged\r\ncondition, a state common to other banks in the group, and the origin\r\nof the singular submarine terraces, which bound the central expanse:\r\nthese, I think, it can be shown, have resulted from a cause analogous\r\nto that which has produced the bifurcating channel across Mahlos\r\nMahdoo.\r\n\r\n [26] This officer has had the kindness to lend me an excellent MS.\r\n account of the Chagos Islands; from this paper, from the published\r\n charts, and from verbal information communicated to me by Captain\r\n Moresby, the above account of the Great Chagos Bank is taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nBARRIER REEFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nClosely resemble in general form and structure atoll-reefs.—Width and\r\ndepth of the lagoon-channels.—Breaches through the reef in front of\r\nvalleys, and generally on the leeward side.—Checks to the filling up of\r\nthe lagoon-channels.—Size and constitution of the encircled islands.—\r\nNumber of islands within the same reef.—Barrier-reefs of New Caledonia\r\nand Australia.—Position of the reef relative to the slope of the\r\nadjoining land.—Probable great thickness of barrier-reefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term “barrier” has been generally applied to that vast reef which\r\nfronts the N.E. shore of Australia, and by most voyagers likewise to\r\nthat on the western coast of New Caledonia. At one time I thought it\r\nconvenient thus to restrict the term, but as these reefs are similar in\r\nstructure, and in position relatively to the land, to those, which,\r\nlike a wall with a deep moat within, encircle many smaller islands, I\r\nhave classed them together. The reef, also, on the west coast of New\r\nCaledonia, circling round the extremities of the island, is an\r\nintermediate form between a small encircling reef and the Australian\r\nbarrier, which stretches for a thousand miles in nearly a straight\r\nline.\r\n\r\nThe geographer Balbi has in effect described those barrier-reefs, which\r\nencircle moderately sized islands, by calling them atolls with high\r\nland rising from within their central expanse. The general resemblance\r\nbetween the reefs of the barrier and atoll classes may be seen in the\r\nsmall, but accurately reduced charts on Plate I.,[1] and this\r\nresemblance can be further shown to extend to every part of the\r\nstructure. Beginning with the outside of the reef; many scattered\r\nsoundings off Gambier, Oualan, and some other encircled islands, show\r\nthat close to the breakers there exists a narrow shelving margin,\r\nbeyond which the ocean becomes suddenly unfathomable; but off the west\r\ncoast of New Caledonia, Captain Kent[2] found no bottom with 150\r\nfathoms, at two ships’ length from the reef; so that the slope here\r\nmust be nearly as precipitous as off the Maldiva atolls.\r\n\r\n [1] The authorities from which these charts have been reduced,\r\n together with some remarks on them and descriptive of the Plates, are\r\n given separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] Dalrymple, “Hydrog. Mem.” volume iii.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can give little information regarding the kinds of corals which live\r\non the outer margin. When I visited the reef at Tahiti, although it was\r\nlow water, the surf was too violent for me to see the living masses;\r\nbut, according to what I heard from some intelligent native chiefs,\r\nthey resemble in their rounded and branchless forms, those on the\r\nmargin of Keeling atoll. The extreme verge of the reef, which was\r\nvisible between the breaking waves at low water, consisted of a\r\nrounded, convex, artificial-like breakwater, entirely coated with\r\nNulliporæ, and absolutely similar to that which I have described at\r\nKeeling atoll. From what I heard when at Tahiti, and from the writings\r\nof the Revs. W. Ellis and J. Williams, I conclude that this peculiar\r\nstructure is common to most of the encircled islands of the Society\r\nArchipelago. The reef within this mound or breakwater, has an extremely\r\nirregular surface, even more so than between the islets on the reef of\r\nKeeling atoll, with which alone (as there are no islets on the reef of\r\nTahiti) it can properly be compared. At Tahiti, the reef is very\r\nirregular in width; but round many other encircled islands, for\r\ninstance, Vanikoro or Gambier Islands (Figures 1 and 8, Plate I.), it\r\nis quite as regular, and of the same average width, as in true atolls.\r\nMost barrier-reefs on the inner side slope irregularly into the\r\nlagoon-channel (as the space of deep water separating the reef from the\r\nincluded land may be called), but at Vanikoro the reef slopes only for\r\na short distance, and then terminates abruptly in a submarine wall,\r\nforty feet high,—a structure absolutely similar to that described by\r\nChamisso in the Marshall atolls.\r\n\r\nIn the Society Archipelago, Ellis[3] states, that the reefs generally\r\nlie at the distance of from one to one and a half miles, and,\r\noccasionally, even at more than three miles, from the shore. The\r\ncentral mountains are generally bordered by a fringe of flat, and often\r\nmarshy, alluvial land, from one to four miles in width. This fringe\r\nconsists of coral-sand and detritus thrown up from the lagoon-channel,\r\nand of soil washed down from the hills; it is an encroachment on the\r\nchannel, analogous to that low and inner part of the islets in many\r\natolls which is formed by the accumulation of matter from the lagoon.\r\nAt Hogoleu (Figure 2, Plate I.), in the Caroline Archipelago,[4] the\r\nreef on the south side is no less than twenty miles; on the east side,\r\nfive; and on the north side, fourteen miles from the encircled high\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n [3] Consult, on this and other points, the “Polynesian Researches,” by\r\n the Rev. W. Ellis, an admirable work, full of curious information.\r\n\r\n\r\n [4] See “Hydrographical Mem.” and the “Atlas of the Voyage of the\r\n _Astrolabe_,” by Captain Dumont D’Urville, page 428.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lagoon channels may be compared in every respect with true lagoons.\r\nIn some cases they are open, with a level bottom of fine sand; in\r\nothers they are choked up with reefs of delicately branched corals,\r\nwhich have the same general character as those within the Keeling\r\natoll. These internal reefs either stand separately, or more commonly\r\nskirt the shores of the included high islands. The depth of the\r\nlagoon-channel round the Society Islands varies from two or three to\r\nthirty fathoms; in Cook’s[5] chart of Ulieta, however, there is one\r\nsounding laid down of forty-eight fathoms; at Vanikoro there are\r\nseveral of fifty-four and one of fifty-six and a half fathoms\r\n(English), a depth which even exceeds by a little that of the interior\r\nof the great Maldiva atolls. Some barrier-reefs have very few islets on\r\nthem; whilst others are surmounted by numerous ones; and those round\r\npart of Bolabola (Plate I., Figure 5) form a single linear strip. The\r\nislets first appear either on the angles of the reef, or on the sides\r\nof the breaches through it, and are generally most numerous on the\r\nwindward side. The reef to leeward retaining its usual width, sometimes\r\nlies submerged several fathoms beneath the surface; I have already\r\nmentioned Gambier Island as an instance of this structure. Submerged\r\nreefs, having a less defined outline, dead, and covered with sand, have\r\nbeen observed (see Appendix) off some parts of Huaheine and Tahiti. The\r\nreef is more frequently breached to leeward than to windward; thus I\r\nfind in Krusenstern’s “Memoir on the Pacific,” that there are passages\r\nthrough the encircling reef on the leeward side of each of the seven\r\nSociety Islands, which possess ship-harbours; but that there are\r\nopenings to windward through the reef of only three of them. The\r\nbreaches in the reef are seldom as deep as the interior lagoon-like\r\nchannel; they generally occur in front of the main valleys, a\r\ncircumstance which can be accounted for, as will be seen in the fourth\r\nchapter, without much difficulty. The breaches being situated in front\r\nof the valleys, which descend indifferently on all sides, explains\r\ntheir more frequent occurrence through the windward side of\r\nbarrier-reefs than through the windward side of atolls,—for in atolls\r\nthere is no included land to influence the position of the breaches.\r\n\r\n [5] See the chart in volume i. of Hawkesworth’s 4to edition of “Cook’s\r\n First Voyage.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that the lagoon-channels round mountainous islands\r\nhave not in every instance been long ago filled up with coral and\r\nsediment; but it is more easily accounted for than appears at first\r\nsight. In cases like that of Hogoleu and the Gambier Islands, where a\r\nfew small peaks rise out of a great lagoon, the conditions scarcely\r\ndiffer from those of an atoll, and I have already shown, at some\r\nlength, that the filling up of a true lagoon must be an extremely slow\r\nprocess. Where the channel is narrow, the agency, which on unprotected\r\ncoasts is most productive of sediment, namely the force of the\r\nbreakers, is here entirely excluded, and the reef being breached in the\r\nfront of the main valleys, much of the finer mud from the rivers must\r\nbe transported into the open sea. As a current is formed by the water\r\nthrown over the edge of atoll-formed reefs, which carries sediment with\r\nit through the deep-water breaches, the same thing probably takes place\r\nin barrier-reefs, and this would greatly aid in preventing the\r\nlagoon-channel from being filled up. The low alluvial border, however,\r\nat the foot of the encircled mountains, shows that the work of filling\r\nup is in progress; and at Maura (Plate I., Figure 6), in the Society\r\ngroup, it has been almost effected, so that there remains only one\r\nharbour for small craft.\r\n\r\nIf we look at a set of charts of barrier-reefs, and leave out in\r\nimagination the encircled land, we shall find that, besides the many\r\npoints already noticed of resemblance, or rather of identity in\r\nstructure with atolls, there is a close general agreement in form,\r\naverage dimensions, and grouping. Encircling barrier-reefs, like\r\natolls, are generally elongated, with an irregularly rounded, though\r\nsometimes angular outline. There are atolls of all sizes, from less\r\nthan two miles in diameter to sixty miles (excluding Tilla-dou-Matte,\r\nas it consists of a number of almost independent atoll-formed reefs);\r\nand there are encircling barrier-reefs from three miles and a half to\r\nforty-six miles in diameter,—Turtle Island being an instance of the\r\nformer, and Hogoleu of the latter. At Tahiti the encircled island is\r\nthirty-six miles in its longest axis, whilst at Maurua it is only a\r\nlittle more than two miles. It will be shown, in the last chapter in\r\nthis volume, that there is the strictest resemblance in the grouping of\r\natolls and of common islands, and consequently there must be the same\r\nresemblance in the grouping of atolls and of encircling barrier-reefs.\r\n\r\nThe islands lying within reefs of this class, are of very various\r\nheights. Tahiti[6] is 7,000 feet; Maurua about 800; Aitutaki 360, and\r\nManouai only 50. The geological nature of the included land varies: in\r\nmost cases it is of ancient volcanic origin, owing apparently to the\r\nfact that islands of this nature are most frequent within all great\r\nseas; some, however, are of madreporitic limestone, and others of\r\nprimary formation, of which latter kind New Caledonia offers the best\r\nexample. The central land consists either of one island, or of several:\r\nthus, in the Society group, Eimeo stands by itself; while Taha and\r\nRaiatea (Figure 3, Plate I.), both moderately large islands of nearly\r\nequal size, are included in one reef. Within the reef of the Gambier\r\ngroup there are four large and some smaller islands (Figure 8, Plate\r\nI.); within that of Hogoleu (Figure 2, Plate I.) nearly a dozen small\r\nislands are scattered over the expanse of one vast lagoon.\r\n\r\n [6] The height of Tahiti is given from Captain Beechey; Maurua from\r\n Mr. F.D. Bennett (“Geograph. Journ.” volume viii., page 220); Aitutaki\r\n from measurements made on board the _Beagle;_ and Manouai or Harvey\r\n Island, from an estimate by the Rev. J. Williams. The two latter\r\n islands, however, are not in some respects well characterised examples\r\n of the encircled class.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the details now given, it may be asserted that there is not one\r\npoint of essential difference between encircling barrier-reefs and\r\natolls: the latter enclose a simple sheet of water, the former encircle\r\nan expanse with one or more islands rising from it. I was much struck\r\nwith this fact, when viewing, from the heights of Tahiti, the distant\r\nisland of Eimeo standing within smooth water, and encircled by a ring\r\nof snow-white breakers. Remove the central land, and an annular reef\r\nlike that of an atoll in an early stage of its formation is left;\r\nremove it from Bolabola, and there remains a circle of linear\r\ncoral-islets, crowned with tall cocoa-nut trees, like one of the many\r\natolls scattered over the Pacific and Indian Oceans.\r\n\r\nThe barrier-reefs of Australia and of New Caledonia deserve a separate\r\nnotice from their great dimensions. The reef on the west coast of New\r\nCaledonia (Figure 5, Plate II.) is 400 miles in length; and for a\r\nlength of many leagues it seldom approaches within eight miles of the\r\nshore; and near the southern end of the island, the space between the\r\nreef and the land is sixteen miles in width. The Australian barrier\r\nextends, with a few interruptions, for nearly a thousand miles; its\r\naverage distance from the land is between twenty and thirty miles; and\r\nin some parts from fifty to seventy. The great arm of the sea thus\r\nincluded, is from ten to twenty-five fathoms deep, with a sandy bottom;\r\nbut towards the southern end, where the reef is further from the shore,\r\nthe depth gradually increases to forty, and in some parts to more than\r\nsixty fathoms. Flinders[7] has described the surface of this reef as\r\nconsisting of a hard white agglomerate of different kinds of coral,\r\nwith rough projecting points. The outer edge is the highest part; it is\r\ntraversed by narrow gullies, and at rare intervals is breached by\r\nship-channels. The sea close outside is profoundly deep; but, in front\r\nof the main breaches, soundings can sometimes be obtained. Some low\r\nislets have been formed on the reef.\r\n\r\n [7] Flinders’ “Voyage to Terra Australis,” volume ii., page 88.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1.

The accompanying diagrams represent north and\r\nsouth vertical sections, taken through the highest points of Vanikoro,\r\nGambier, and Maurua Islands, and through their encircling reefs. The\r\nscale both in the horizontal and vertical direction is the same,\r\nnamely, a quarter of an inch to a nautical mile. The height and width\r\nof these islands is known; and I have attempted to represent the form\r\nof the land from the shading of the hills in the large published\r\ncharts. It has long been remarked, even from the time of Dampier, that\r\nconsiderable degree of relation subsists between the inclination of\r\nthat part of the land which is beneath water and that above it; hence\r\nthe dotted line in the three sections, probably, does not widely differ\r\nin inclination from the actual submarine prolongation of the land. If\r\nwe now look at the outer edge of the reef (AA), and bear in mind that\r\nthe plummet on the right hand represents a depth of 1,200 feet, we must\r\nconclude that the vertical thickness of these barrier coral-reefs is\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\nI must observe that if the sections had been taken in any other\r\ndirection across these islands, or across other encircled islands,[8]\r\nthe result would have been the same. In the succeeding chapter it will\r\nbe shown that reef-building polypifers cannot flourish at great\r\ndepths,—for instance, it is highly improbable that they could exist at\r\na quarter of the depth represented by the plummet on the right hand of\r\nthe woodcut. Here there is a great _apparent_ difficulty—how were the\r\nbasal parts of these barrier-reef formed? It will, perhaps, occur to\r\nsome, that the actual reefs formed of coral are not of great thickness,\r\nbut that before their first growth, the coasts of these encircled\r\nislands were deeply eaten into, and a broad but shallow submarine ledge\r\nthus left, on the edge of which the coral grew; but if this had been\r\nthe case, the shore would have been invariably bounded by lofty cliffs,\r\nand not have sloped down to the lagoon-channel, as it does in many\r\ninstances. On this view,[9] moreover, the cause of the reef springing\r\nup at such a great distance from the land, leaving a deep and broad\r\nmoat within, remains altogether unexplained. A supposition of the same\r\nnature, and appearing at first more probable is, that the reefs sprung\r\nup from banks of sediment, which had accumulated round the shore\r\npreviously to the growth of the coral; but the extension of a bank to\r\nthe same distance round an unbroken coast, and in front of those deep\r\narms of the sea (as in Raiatea, see Plate II., Figure 3) which\r\npenetrate nearly to the heart of some encircled islands, is exceedingly\r\nimprobable. And why, again, should the reef spring up, in some cases\r\nsteep on both sides like a wall, at a distance of two, three or more\r\nmiles from the shore, leaving a channel often between two hundred and\r\nthree hundred feet deep, and rising from a depth which we have reason\r\nto believe is destructive to the growth of coral? An admission of this\r\nnature cannot possibly be made. The existence, also, of the deep\r\nchannel, utterly precludes the idea of the reef having grown outwards,\r\non a foundation slowly formed on its outside, by the accumulation of\r\nsediment and coral detritus. Nor, again, can it be asserted, that the\r\nreef-building corals will not grow, excepting at a great distance from\r\nthe land; for, as we shall soon see, there is a whole class of reefs,\r\nwhich take their name from growing closely attached (especially where\r\nthe sea is deep) to the beach. At New Caledonia (see Plate II., Figure\r\n5) the reefs which run in front of the west coast are prolonged in the\r\nsame line 150 miles beyond the northern extremity of the island, and\r\nthis shows that some explanation, quite different from any of those\r\njust suggested, is required. The continuation of the reefs on each side\r\nof the submarine prolongation of New Caledonia, is an exceedingly\r\ninteresting fact, if this part formerly existed as the northern\r\nextremity of the island, and before the attachment of the coral had\r\nbeen worn down by the action of the sea, or if it originally existed at\r\nits present height, with or without beds of sediment on each flank, how\r\ncan we possibly account for the reefs, not growing on the crest of this\r\nsubmarine portion, but fronting its sides, in the same line with the\r\nreefs which front the shores of the lofty island? We shall hereafter\r\nsee, that there is one, and I believe only one, solution of this\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n [8] In the fifth chapter an east and west section across the Island of\r\n Bolabola and its barrier-reefs is given, for the sake of illustrating\r\n another point. The unbroken line in it (woodcut No. 5) is the section\r\n referred to. The scale is .57 of an inch to a mile; it is taken from\r\n the “Atlas of the Voyage of the _Coquille_,” by Duperrey. The depth of\r\n the lagoon-channel is exaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n [9] The Rev. D. Tyerman and Mr. Bennett (“Journal of Voyage and\r\n Travels,” volume i., page 215) have briefly suggested this explanation\r\n of the origin of the encircling reefs of the Society Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne other supposition to account for the position of encircling\r\nbarrier-reefs remains, but it is almost too preposterous to be\r\nmentioned; namely, that they rest on enormous submarine craters,\r\nsurrounding the included islands. When the size, height, and form of\r\nthe islands in the Society group are considered, together with the fact\r\nthat all are thus encircled, such a notion will be rejected by almost\r\nevery one. New Caledonia, moreover, besides its size, is composed of\r\nprimitive formations, as are some of the Comoro Islands;[10] and\r\nAitutaki consists of calcareous rock. We must, therefore, reject these\r\nseveral explanations, and conclude that the vertical thickness of\r\nbarrier-reefs, from their outer edges to the foundation on which they\r\nrest (from _AA_ in the section to the dotted lines) is really great;\r\nbut in this, there is no difficulty, for it is not necessary to suppose\r\nthat the coral has sprung up from an immense depth, as will be evident\r\nwhen the theory of the upward growth of coral-reefs, during the slow\r\nsubsidence of their foundation, is discussed.\r\n\r\n [10] I have been informed that this is the case by Dr. Allan of\r\n Forres, who has visited this group.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nFRINGING OR SHORE-REEFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nReefs of Mauritius.—Shallow channel within the reef.—Its slow filling\r\nup.—Currents of water formed within it.—Upraised reefs.—Narrow\r\nfringing-reefs in deep seas.—Reefs on the coast of East Africa and of\r\nBrazil.—Fringing-reefs in very shallow seas, round banks of sediment\r\nand on worn-down islands.—Fringing-reefs affected by currents of the\r\nsea.— Coral coating the bottom of the sea, but not forming reefs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFringing-reefs, or, as they have been called by some voyagers,\r\nshore-reefs, whether skirting an island or part of a continent, might\r\nat first be thought to differ little, except in generally being of less\r\nbreadth, from barrier-reefs. As far as the superficies of the actual\r\nreef is concerned this is the case; but the absence of an interior\r\ndeep-water channel, and the close relation in their horizontal\r\nextension with the probable slope beneath the sea of the adjoining\r\nland, present essential points of difference.\r\n\r\nThe reefs which fringe the island of Mauritius offer a good example of\r\nthis class. They extend round its whole circumference, with the\r\nexception of two or three parts,[1] where the coast is almost\r\nprecipitous, and where, if as is probable the bottom of the sea has a\r\nsimilar inclination, the coral would have no foundation on which to\r\nbecome attached. A similar fact may sometimes be observed even in reefs\r\nof the barrier class, which follow much less closely the outline of the\r\nadjoining land; as, for instance, on the south-east and precipitous\r\nside of Tahiti, where the encircling reef is interrupted. On the\r\nwestern side of the Mauritius, which was the only part I visited, the\r\nreef generally lies at the distance of about half a mile from the\r\nshore; but in some parts it is distant from one to two, and even three\r\nmiles. But even in this last case, as the coast-land is gently inclined\r\nfrom the foot of the mountains to the sea-beach, and as the soundings\r\noutside the reef indicate an equally gentle slope beneath the water,\r\nthere is no reason for supposing that the basis of the reef, formed by\r\nthe prolongation of the strata of the island, lies at a greater depth\r\nthan that at which the polypifers could begin constructing the reef.\r\nSome allowance, however, must be made for the outward extension of the\r\ncorals on a foundation of sand and detritus, formed from their own\r\nwear, which would give to the reef a somewhat greater vertical\r\nthickness, than would otherwise be possible.\r\n\r\n [1] This fact is stated on the authority of the Officier du Roi, in\r\n his extremely interesting “Voyage à l’Isle de France,” undertaken in\r\n 1768. According to Captain Carmichael (Hooker’s “Bot. Misc.” volume\r\n ii., page 316) on one part of the coast there is a space for sixteen\r\n miles without a reef.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe outer edge of the reef on the western or leeward side of the island\r\nis tolerably well defined, and is a little higher than any other part.\r\nIt chiefly consists of large strongly branched corals, of the genus\r\nMadrepora, which also form a sloping bed some way out to sea: the kinds\r\nof coral growing in this part will be described in the ensuing chapter.\r\nBetween the outer margin and the beach, there is a flat space with a\r\nsandy bottom and a few tufts of living coral; in some parts it is so\r\nshallow, that people, by avoiding the deeper holes and gullies, can\r\nwade across it at low water; in other parts it is deeper, seldom\r\nhowever exceeding ten or twelve feet, so that it offers a safe coasting\r\nchannel for boats. On the eastern and windward side of the island,\r\nwhich is exposed to a heavy surf, the reef was described to me as\r\nhaving a hard smooth surface, very slightly inclined inwards, just\r\ncovered at low-water, and traversed by gullies; it appears to be quite\r\nsimilar in structure to the reefs of the barrier and atoll classes.\r\n\r\nThe reef of Mauritius, in front of every river and streamlet, is\r\nbreached by a straight passage: at Grand Port, however, there is a\r\nchannel like that within a barrier-reef; it extends parallel to the\r\nshore for four miles, and has an average depth of ten or twelve\r\nfathoms; its presence may probably be accounted for by two rivers which\r\nenter at each end of the channel, and bend towards each other. The fact\r\nof reefs of the fringing class being always breached in front of\r\nstreams, even of those which are dry during the greater part of the\r\nyear, will be explained, when the conditions unfavourable to the growth\r\nof coral are considered. Low coral-islets, like those on barrier-reefs\r\nand atolls, are seldom formed on reefs of this class, owing apparently\r\nin some cases to their narrowness, and in others to the gentle slope of\r\nthe reef outside not yielding many fragments to the breakers. On the\r\nwindward side, however, of the Mauritius, two or three small islets\r\nhave been formed.\r\n\r\nIt appears, as will be shown in the ensuing chapter, that the action of\r\nthe surf is favourable to the vigorous growth of the stronger corals,\r\nand that sand or sediment, if agitated by the waves, is injurious to\r\nthem. Hence it is probable that a reef on a shelving shore, like that\r\nof Mauritius, would at first grow up, not attached to the actual beach,\r\nbut at some little distance from it; and the corals on the outer margin\r\nwould be the most vigorous. A shallow channel would thus be formed\r\nwithin the reef, and as the breakers are prevented acting on the shores\r\nof the island, and as they do not ordinarily tear up many fragments\r\nfrom the outside, and as every streamlet has its bed prolonged in a\r\nstraight line through the reef, this channel could be filled up only\r\nvery slowly with sediment. But a beach of sand and of fragments of the\r\nsmaller kinds of coral seems, in the case of Mauritius, to be slowly\r\nencroaching on the shallow channel. On many shelving and sandy coasts,\r\nthe breakers tend to form a bar of sand a little way from the beach,\r\nwith a slight increase of depth within it; for instance, Captain\r\nGrey[2] states that the west coast of Australia, in latitude 24°, is\r\nfronted by a sand bar about two hundred yards in width, on which there\r\nis only two feet of water; but within it the depth increases to two\r\nfathoms. Similar bars, more or less perfect, occur on other coasts. In\r\nthese cases I suspect that the shallow channel (which no doubt during\r\nstorms is occasionally obliterated) is scooped out by the flowing away\r\nof the water thrown beyond the line, on which the waves break with the\r\ngreatest force. At Pernambuco a bar of hard sandstone,[3] which has the\r\nsame external form and height as a coral-reef, extends nearly parallel\r\nto the coast; within this bar currents, apparently caused by the water\r\nthrown over it during the greater part of each tide, run strongly, and\r\nare wearing away its inner wall. From these facts it can hardly be\r\ndoubted, that within most fringing-reefs, especially within those lying\r\nsome distance from the land, a return stream must carry away the water\r\nthrown over the outer edge; and the current thus produced, would tend\r\nto prevent the channel being filled up with sediment, and might even\r\ndeepen it under certain circumstances. To this latter belief I am led,\r\nby finding that channels are almost universally present within the\r\nfringing-reefs of those islands which have undergone recent elevatory\r\nmovements; and this could hardly have been the case, if the conversion\r\nof the very shallow channel into land had not been counteracted to a\r\ncertain extent.\r\n\r\n [2] Captain Grey’s “Journal of Two Expeditions,” volume i. page 369.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] I have described this singular structure in the “London and\r\n Edinburgh Phil. Mag.” October 1841.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fringing-reef, if elevated in a perfect condition above the level of\r\nthe sea, ought to present the singular appearance of a broad dry moat\r\nwithin a low mound. The author[4] of an interesting pedestrian tour\r\nround the Mauritius, seems to have met with a structure of this kind:\r\nhe says “J’observai que là, où la mer étale, indépendamment des rescifs\r\ndu large, il y à terre _une espèce d’effoncement_ ou chemin couvert\r\nnaturel. On y pourrait mettre du canon,” etc. In another place he adds,\r\n“Avant de passer le Cap, on remarque un gros banc de corail elévé de\r\nplus de quinze pieds: c’est une espèce de rescif, que la mer abandonné,\r\nil regne au pied une longue flaque d’eau, dont on pourrait faire un\r\nbassin pour de petits vaisseaux.” But the margin of the reef, although\r\nthe highest and most perfect part, from being most exposed to the surf,\r\nwould generally during a slow rise of the land be either partially or\r\nentirely worn down to that level, at which corals could renew their\r\ngrowth on its upper edge. On some parts of the coast-land of Mauritius\r\nthere are little hillocks of coral-rock, which are either the last\r\nremnants of a continuous reef, or of low islets formed on it. I\r\nobserved that two such hillocks between Tamarin Bay and the Great Black\r\nRiver; they were nearly twenty feet high, about two hundred yards from\r\nthe present beach, and about thirty feet above its level. They rose\r\nabruptly from a smooth surface, strewed with worn fragments of coral.\r\nThey consisted in their lower part of hard calcareous sandstone, and in\r\ntheir upper of great blocks of several species of Astræa and Madrepora,\r\nloosely aggregated; they were divided into irregular beds, dipping\r\nseaward, in one hillock at an angle of 8°, and in the other at 18° I\r\nsuspect that the superficial parts of the reefs, which have been\r\nupraised together with the islands they fringe, have generally been\r\nmuch more modified by the wearing action of the sea, than those of\r\nMauritius.\r\n\r\n [4] “Voyage à l’Isle de France, par un Officier du Roi,” part i.,\r\n pages 192, 200.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany islands[5] are fringed by reefs quite similar to those of\r\nMauritius; but on coasts where the sea deepens very suddenly the reefs\r\nare much narrower, and their limited extension seems evidently to\r\ndepend on the high inclination of the submarine slope; a relation,\r\nwhich, as we have seen, does not exist in reefs of the barrier class.\r\nThe fringing-reefs on steep coasts are frequently not more than from\r\nfifty to one hundred yards in width; they have a nearly smooth, hard\r\nsurface, scarcely uncovered at low water, and without any interior\r\nshoal channel, like that within those fringing-reefs, which lie at a\r\ngreater distance from the land. The fragments torn up during gales from\r\nthe outer margin are thrown over the reef on the shores of the island.\r\nI may give as instances, Wateeo, where the reef is described by Cook as\r\nbeing a hundred yards wide; and Mauti and Elizabeth Islands,[6] where\r\nit is only fifty yards in width: the sea round these islands is very\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\n [5] I may give Cuba, as another instance; Mr. Taylor (Loudon’s Mag. of\r\n Nat. Hist. volume ix., page 449) has described a reef several miles in\r\n length between Gibara and Vjaro, which extends parallel to the shore\r\n at the distance of between half and the third part of a mile, and\r\n encloses a space of shallow water, with a sandy bottom and tufts of\r\n coral. Outside the edge of the reef, which is formed of great\r\n branching corals, the depth is six and seven fathoms. This coast has\r\n been upheaved at no very distant geological period.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [6] Mauti is described by Lord Byron in the voyage of H.M.S. _Blonde_,\r\n and Elizabeth Island by Captain Beechey.\r\n\r\n\r\nFringing-reefs, like barrier-reefs, both surround islands, and front\r\nthe shores of continents. In the charts of the eastern coast of Africa,\r\nby Captain Owen, many extensive fringing-reefs are laid down; thus, for\r\na space of nearly forty miles, from latitude 1° 15′ to 1° 45′ S., a\r\nreef fringes the shore at an average distance of rather more than one\r\nmile, and therefore at a greater distance than is usual in reefs of\r\nthis class; but as the coast-land is not lofty, and as the bottom\r\nshoals very gradually (the depth being only from eight to fourteen\r\nfathoms at a mile and a half outside the reef), its extension thus far\r\nfrom the land offers no difficulty. The external margin of this reef is\r\ndescribed, as formed of projecting points, within which there is a\r\nspace, from six to twelve feet deep, with patches of living coral on\r\nit. At Mukdeesha (latitude 2° 1′ N.) “the port is formed,” it is\r\nsaid,[7] “by a long reef extending eastward, four or five miles, within\r\nwhich there is a narrow channel, with ten to twelve feet of water at\r\nlow spring-tides;” it lies at the distance of a quarter of a mile from\r\nthe shore. Again, in the plan of Mombas (latitude 4° S.), a reef\r\nextends for thirty-six miles, at the distance of from half a mile to\r\none mile and a quarter from the shore; within it, there is a channel\r\nnavigable “for canoes and small craft,” between six and fifteen feet\r\ndeep: outside the reef the depth is about thirty fathoms at the\r\ndistance of nearly half a mile. Part of this reef is very symmetrical,\r\nand has a uniform breadth of two hundred yards.\r\n\r\n [7] Owen’s “Africa,” volume i., page 357, from which work the\r\n foregoing facts are likewise taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coast of Brazil is in many parts fringed by reefs. Of these, some\r\nare not of coral formation; for instance, those near Bahia and in front\r\nof Pernambuco; but a few miles south of this latter city, the reef\r\nfollows[8] so closely every turn of the shore, that I can hardly doubt\r\nit is of coral; it runs at the distance of three-quarters of a mile\r\nfrom the land, and within it the depth is from ten to fifteen feet. I\r\nwas assured by an intelligent pilot that at Ports Frances and Maceio,\r\nthe outer part of the reef consists of living coral, and the inner of a\r\nwhite stone, full of large irregular cavities, communicating with the\r\nsea. The bottom of the sea off the coast of Brazil shoals gradually to\r\nbetween thirty and forty fathoms, at the distance of between nine and\r\nten leagues from the land.\r\n\r\n [8] See Baron Roussin’s “Pilote du Brésil,” and accompanying\r\n hydrographical memoir.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the description now given, we must conclude that the dimensions\r\nand structure of fringing-reefs depend entirely on the greater or less\r\ninclination of the submarine slope, conjoined with the fact that\r\nreef-building polypifers can exist only at limited depths. It follows\r\nfrom this, that where the sea is very shallow, as in the Persian Gulf\r\nand in parts of the East Indian Archipelago, the reefs lose their\r\nfringing character, and appear as separate and irregularly scattered\r\npatches, often of considerable area. From the more vigorous growth of\r\nthe coral on the outside, and from the conditions being less favourable\r\nin several respects within, such reefs are generally higher and more\r\nperfect in their marginal than in their central parts; hence these\r\nreefs sometimes assume (and this circumstance ought not to be\r\noverlooked) the appearance of atolls; but they differ from atolls in\r\ntheir central expanse being much less deep, in their form being less\r\ndefined, and in being based on a shallow foundation. But when in a deep\r\nsea reefs fringe banks of sediment, which have accumulated beneath the\r\nsurface, round either islands or submerged rocks, they are\r\ndistinguished with difficulty on the one hand from encircling\r\nbarrier-reefs, and on the other from atolls. In the West Indies there\r\nare reefs, which I should probably have arranged under both these\r\nclasses, had not the existence of large and level banks, lying a little\r\nbeneath the surface, ready to serve as the basis for the attachment of\r\ncoral, been occasionally brought into view by the entire or partial\r\nabsence of reefs on them, and had not the formation of such banks,\r\nthrough the accumulation of sediment now in progress, been sufficiently\r\nevident. Fringing-reefs sometimes coat, and thus protect the\r\nfoundations of islands, which have been worn down by the surf to the\r\nlevel of the sea. According to Ehrenberg, this has been extensively the\r\ncase with the islands in the Red Sea, which formerly ranged parallel to\r\nthe shores of the mainland, with deep water within them: hence the\r\nreefs now coating their bases are situated relatively to the land like\r\nbarrier-reefs, although not belonging to that class; but there are, as\r\nI believe, in the Red Sea some true barrier-reefs. The reefs of this\r\nsea and of the West Indies will be described in the Appendix. In some\r\ncases, fringing-reefs appear to be considerably modified in outline by\r\nthe course of the prevailing currents. Dr. J. Allan informs me that on\r\nthe east coast of Madagascar almost every headland and low point of\r\nsand has a coral-reef extending from it in a S.W. and N.E. line,\r\nparallel to the currents on that shore. I should think the influence of\r\nthe currents chiefly consisted in causing an extension, in a certain\r\ndirection, of a proper foundation for the attachment of the coral.\r\nRound many intertropical islands, for instance the Abrolhos on the\r\ncoast of Brazil surveyed by Captain Fitzroy, and, as I am informed by\r\nMr. Cuming, round the Philippines, the bottom of the sea is entirely\r\ncoated by irregular masses of coral, which although often of large\r\nsize, do not reach the surface and form proper reefs. This must be\r\nowing, either to insufficient growth, or to the absence of those kinds\r\nof corals which can withstand the breaking of the waves.\r\n\r\nThe three classes, atoll-formed, barrier, and fringing-reefs, together\r\nwith the modifications just described of the latter, include all the\r\nmost remarkable coral formations anywhere existing. At the commencement\r\nof the last chapter in the volume, where I detail the principles on\r\nwhich the map (Plate III.) is coloured, the exceptional cases will be\r\nenumerated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nON THE DISTRIBUTION AND GROWTH OF CORAL-REEFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this chapter I will give all the facts which I have collected,\r\nrelating to the distribution of coral-reefs,—to the conditions\r\nfavourable to their increase,—to the rate of their growth,—and to the\r\ndepth at which they are formed.\r\n\r\nThese subjects have an important bearing on the theory of the origin of\r\nthe different classes of coral-reefs.\r\n\r\nSECTION I.—ON THE DISTRIBUTION OF CORAL-REEFS, AND ON THE CONDITIONS\r\nFAVOURABLE TO THEIR INCREASE.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the limits of latitude, over which coral-reefs extend, I\r\nhave nothing new to add. The Bermuda Islands, in 32° 15′ N., is the\r\npoint furthest removed from the equator, in which they appear to exist;\r\nand it has been suggested that their extension so far northward in this\r\ninstance is owing to the warmth of the Gulf Stream. In the Pacific, the\r\nLoo Choo Islands, in latitude 27° N., have reefs on their shores, and\r\nthere is an atoll in 28° 30′, situated N.W. of the Sandwich\r\nArchipelago. In the Red Sea there are coral-reefs in latitude 30°. In\r\nthe southern hemisphere coral-reefs do not extend so far from the\r\nequatorial sea. In the Southern Pacific there are only a few reefs\r\nbeyond the line of the tropics, but Houtmans Abrolhos, on the western\r\nshores of Australia in latitude 29° S., are of coral formation.\r\n\r\nThe proximity of volcanic land, owing to the lime generally evolved\r\nfrom it, has been thought to be favourable to the increase of\r\ncoral-reefs. There is, however, not much foundation for this view; for\r\nnowhere are coral-reefs more extensive than on the shores of New\r\nCaledonia, and of north-eastern Australia, which consist of primary\r\nformations; and in the largest groups of atolls, namely the Maldiva,\r\nChagos, Marshall, Gilbert, and Low Archipelagoes, there is no volcanic\r\nor other kind of rock, excepting that formed of coral.\r\n\r\nThe entire absence of coral-reefs in certain large areas within the\r\ntropical seas, is a remarkable fact. Thus no coral-reefs were observed,\r\nduring the surveying voyages of the “Beagle” and her tender on the west\r\ncoast of South America south of the equator, or round the Galapagos\r\nIslands. It appears, also, that there are none[1] north of the equator;\r\nMr. Lloyd, who surveyed the Isthmus of Panama, remarked to me, that\r\nalthough he had seen corals living in the Bay of Panama, yet he had\r\nnever observed any reefs formed by them. I at first attributed this\r\nabsence of reefs on the coasts of Peru and of the Galapagos Islands,[2]\r\nto the coldness of the currents from the south, but the Gulf of Panama\r\nis one of the hottest pelagic districts in the world.[3] In the central\r\nparts of the Pacific there are islands entirely free from reefs; in\r\nsome few of these cases I have thought that this was owing to recent\r\nvolcanic action; but the existence of reefs round the greater part of\r\nHawaii, one of the Sandwich Islands, shows that recent volcanic action\r\ndoes not necessarily prevent their growth.\r\n\r\n [1] I have been informed that this is the case, by Lieutenant Ryder,\r\n R.N., and others who have had ample opportunities for observation.\r\n\r\n\r\n [2] The mean temperature of the surface sea from observations made by\r\n the direction of Captain Fitzroy on the shores of the Galapagos\r\n Islands, between the 16th of September and the 20th of October, 1835,\r\n was 68° Fahr. The lowest temperature observed was 58.5° at the\r\n south-west end of Albemarle Island; and on the west coast of this\r\n island, it was several times 62° and 63°. The mean temperature of the\r\n sea in the Low Archipelago of atolls, and near Tahiti, from similar\r\n observations made on board the _Beagle_, was (although further from\r\n the equator) 77.5°, the lowest any day being 76.5°. Therefore we have\r\n here a difference of 9.5° in mean temperature, and 18° in extremes; a\r\n difference doubtless quite sufficient to affect the distribution of\r\n organic beings in the two areas.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] Humboldt’s “Personal Narrative,” volume vii., page 434.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I stated that the bottom of the sea round some\r\nislands is thickly coated with living corals, which nevertheless do not\r\nform reefs, either from insufficient growth, or from the species not\r\nbeing adapted to contend with the breaking waves.\r\n\r\nI have been assured by several people, that there are no coral-reefs on\r\nthe west coast of Africa,[4] or round the islands in the Gulf of\r\nGuinea. This perhaps may be attributed, in part, to the sediment\r\nbrought down by the many rivers debouching on that coast, and to the\r\nextensive mud-banks, which line great part of it. But the islands of\r\nSt. Helena, Ascension, the Cape Verdes, St. Paul’s, and Fernando\r\nNoronha, are, also, entirely without reefs, although they lie far out\r\nat sea, are composed of the same ancient volcanic rocks, and have the\r\nsame general form, with those islands in the Pacific, the shores of\r\nwhich are surrounded by gigantic walls of coral-rock. With the\r\nexception of Bermuda, there is not a single coral-reef in the central\r\nexpanse of the Atlantic Ocean. It will, perhaps, be suggested that the\r\nquantity of carbonate of lime in different parts of the sea, may\r\nregulate the presence of reefs. But this cannot be the case, for at\r\nAscension, the waves charged to excess precipitate a thick layer of\r\ncalcareous matter on the tidal rocks; and at St. Jago, in the Cape\r\nVerdes, carbonate of lime not only is abundant on the shores, but it\r\nforms the chief part of some upraised post-tertiary strata. The\r\napparently capricious distribution, therefore, of coral-reefs, cannot\r\nbe explained by any of these obvious causes; but as the study of the\r\nterrestrial and better known half of the world must convince every one\r\nthat no station capable of supporting life is lost,—nay more, that\r\nthere is a struggle for each station, between the different orders of\r\nnature,—we may conclude that in those parts of the intertropical sea,\r\nin which there are no coral-reefs, there are other organic bodies\r\nsupplying the place of the reef-building polypifers. It has been shown\r\nin the chapter on Keeling atoll that there are some species of large\r\nfish, and the whole tribe of Holothuriæ which prey on the tenderer\r\nparts of the corals. On the other hand, the polypifers in their turn\r\nmust prey on some other organic beings; the decrease of which from any\r\ncause would cause a proportionate destruction of the living coral. The\r\nrelations, therefore, which determine the formation of reefs on any\r\nshore, by the vigorous growth of the efficient kinds of coral, must be\r\nvery complex, and with our imperfect knowledge quite inexplicable. From\r\nthese considerations, we may infer that changes in the condition of the\r\nsea, not obvious to our senses, might destroy all the coral-reefs in\r\none area, and cause them to appear in another: thus, the Pacific or\r\nIndian Ocean might become as barren of coral-reefs as the Atlantic now\r\nis, without our being able to assign any adequate cause for such a\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n [4] It might be concluded, from a paper by Captain Owen (“Geographical\r\n Journal”, volume ii., page 89), that the reefs off Cape St. Anne and\r\n the Sherboro’ Islands were of coral, although the author states that\r\n they are not purely coralline. But I have been assured by Lieutenant\r\n Holland, R.N., that these reefs are not of coral, or at least that\r\n they do not at all resemble those in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been a question with some naturalists, which part of a reef is\r\nmost favourable to the growth of coral. The great mounds of living\r\nPorites and of Millepora round Keeling atoll occur exclusively on the\r\nextreme verge of the reef, which is washed by a constant succession of\r\nbreakers; and living coral nowhere else forms solid masses. At the\r\nMarshall islands the larger kinds of coral (chiefly species of Astræa,\r\na genus closely allied to Porites) “which form rocks measuring several\r\nfathoms in thickness,” prefer, according to Chamisso,[5] the most\r\nviolent surf. I have stated that the outer margin of the Maldiva atolls\r\nconsists of living corals (some of which, if not all, are of the same\r\nspecies with those at Keeling atoll), and here the surf is so\r\ntremendous, that even large ships have been thrown, by a single heave\r\nof the sea, high and dry on the reef, all on board thus escaping with\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n [5] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage” (English Translation) volume iii., pages\r\n 142, 143, 331.\r\n\r\n\r\nEhrenberg[6] remarks, that in the Red Sea the strongest corals live on\r\nthe outer reefs, and appear to love the surf; he adds, that the more\r\nbranched kinds abound a little way within, but that even these in still\r\nmore protected places, become smaller. Many other facts having a\r\nsimilar tendency might be adduced.[7] It has, however, been doubted by\r\nMM. Quoy and Gaimard, whether any kind of coral can even withstand,\r\nmuch less flourish in, the breakers of an open sea:[8] they affirm that\r\nthe saxigenous lithophytes flourish only where the water is tranquil,\r\nand the heat intense. This statement has passed from one geological\r\nwork to another; nevertheless, the protection of the whole reef\r\nundoubtedly is due to those kinds of coral, which cannot exist in the\r\nsituations thought by these naturalists to be most favourable to them.\r\nFor should the outer and living margin perish, of any one of the many\r\nlow coral-islands, round which a line of great breakers is incessantly\r\nfoaming, the whole, it is scarcely possible to doubt, would be washed\r\naway and destroyed, in less than half a century. But the vital energies\r\nof the corals conquer the mechanical power of the waves; and the large\r\nfragments of reef torn up by every storm, are replaced by the slow but\r\nsteady growth of the innumerable polypifers, which form the living zone\r\non its outer edge.\r\n\r\n [6] Ehrenberg, “Über die Natür und Bildung der Corallen Bänke im\r\n rothen Meere,” page 49.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] In the West Indies, as I am informed by Captain Bird Allen, R.N.,\r\n it is the common belief of those, who are best acquainted with the\r\n reefs, that the coral flourishes most, where freely exposed to the\r\n swell of the open sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] “Annales des Sciences Naturelles,” tome vi., pages 276, 278.—“Là\r\n où les ondes sont agitées, les Lytophytés ne peuvent travailler, parce\r\n qu’elles détruiraient leurs fragiles édifices,” &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom these facts, it is certain, that the strongest and most massive\r\ncorals flourish, where most exposed. The less perfect state of the reef\r\nof most atolls on the leeward and less exposed side, compared with its\r\nstate to windward; and the analogous case of the greater number of\r\nbreaches on the near sides of those atolls in the Maldiva Archipelago,\r\nwhich afford some protection to each other, are obviously explained by\r\nthis circumstance. If the question had been, under what conditions the\r\ngreater number of species of coral, not regarding their bulk and\r\nstrength, were developed, I should answer,—probably in the situations\r\ndescribed by MM. Quoy and Gaimard, where the water is tranquil and the\r\nheat intense. The total number of species of coral in the\r\ncircumtropical seas must be very great: in the Red Sea alone, 120\r\nkinds, according to Ehrenberg,[9] have been observed.\r\n\r\n [9] Ehrenberg, “Über die Natür,” etc., etc., page 46.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same author has observed that the recoil of the sea from a steep\r\nshore is injurious to the growth of coral, although waves breaking over\r\na bank are not so. Ehrenberg also states, that where there is much\r\nsediment, placed so as to be liable to be moved by the waves there is\r\nlittle or no coral; and a collection of living specimens placed by him\r\non a sandy shore died in the course of a few days.[10] An experiment,\r\nhowever, will presently be related in which some large masses of living\r\ncoral increased rapidly in size, after having been secured by stakes on\r\na sandbank. That loose sediment should be injurious to the living\r\npolypifers, appears, at first sight, probable; and accordingly, in\r\nsounding off Keeling atoll, and (as will hereafter be shown) off\r\nMauritius, the arming of the lead invariably came up clean, where the\r\ncoral was growing vigorously. This same circumstance has probably given\r\nrise to a strange belief, which, according to Captain Owen,[11] is\r\ngeneral amongst the inhabitants of the Maldiva atolls, namely that\r\ncorals have roots, and therefore that if merely broken down to the\r\nsurface, they grow up again; but, if rooted out, they are permanently\r\ndestroyed. By this means the inhabitants keep their harbours clear; and\r\nthus the French Governor of St. Mary’s in Madagascar, “cleared out and\r\nmade a beautiful little port at that place.” For it is probable that\r\nsand would accumulate in the hollows formed by tearing out the corals,\r\nbut not on the broken and projecting stumps, and therefore, in the\r\nformer case, the fresh growth of the coral might be thus prevented.\r\n\r\n [10] Ibid., page 49.\r\n\r\n\r\n [11] Captain Owen on the Geography of the Maldiva Islands,\r\n “Geographical Journal”, volume ii., page 88.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter I remarked that fringing-reefs are almost\r\nuniversally breached, where streams enter the sea.[12] Most authors\r\nhave attributed this fact to the injurious effects of the fresh water,\r\neven where it enters the sea only in small quantity, and during a part\r\nof the year. No doubt brackish water would prevent or retard the growth\r\nof coral; but I believe that the mud and sand which is deposited, even\r\nby rivulets when flooded, is a much more efficient check. The reef on\r\neach side of the channel leading into Port Louis at Mauritius, ends\r\nabruptly in a wall, at the foot of which I sounded and found a bed of\r\nthick mud. This steepness of the sides appears to be a general\r\ncharacter in such breaches. Cook,[13] speaking of one at Raiatea, says,\r\n“like all the rest, it is very steep on both sides.” Now, if it were\r\nthe fresh water mingling with the salt which prevented the growth of\r\ncoral, the reef certainly would not terminate abruptly, but as the\r\npolypifers nearest the impure stream would grow less vigorously than\r\nthose farther off, so would the reef gradually thin away. On the other\r\nhand, the sediment brought down from the land would only prevent the\r\ngrowth of the coral in the line of its deposition, but would not check\r\nit on the side, so that the reefs might increase till they overhung the\r\nbed of the channel. The breaches are much fewer in number, and front\r\nonly the larger valleys in reefs of the encircling barrier class. They\r\nprobably are kept open in the same manner as those into the lagoon of\r\nan atoll, namely, by the force of the currents and the drifting\r\noutwards of fine sediment. Their position in front of valleys, although\r\noften separated from the land by deep water lagoon-channels, which it\r\nmight be thought would entirely remove the injurious effects both of\r\nthe fresh water and the sediment, will receive a simple explanation\r\nwhen we discuss the origin of barrier-reefs.\r\n\r\n [12] Lieutenant Wellstead and others have remarked that this is the\r\n case in the Red Sea; Dr. Rüppell (“Reise in Abyss.” Band. i., page\r\n 142) says that there are pear-shaped harbours in the upraised\r\n coral-coast, into which periodical streams enter. From this\r\n circumstance, I presume, we must infer that before the upheaval of the\r\n strata now forming the coast-land, fresh water and sediment entered\r\n the sea at these points; and the coral being thus prevented growing,\r\n the pear-shaped harbours were produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] Cook’s “First Voyage,” volume ii., page 271 (Hawkesworth’s\r\n edition).)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the vegetable kingdom every different station has its peculiar group\r\nof plants, and similar relations appear to prevail with corals. We have\r\nalready described the great difference between the corals within the\r\nlagoon of an atoll and those on its outer margin. The corals, also, on\r\nthe margin of Keeling Island occurred in zones; thus the _Porites_ and\r\n_Millepora complanata_ grow to a large size only where they are washed\r\nby a heavy sea, and are killed by a short exposure to the air; whereas,\r\nthree species of Nullipora also live amidst the breakers, but are able\r\nto survive uncovered for a part of each tide; at greater depths, a\r\nstrong Madrepora and _Millepora alcicornis_ are the commonest kinds,\r\nthe former appearing to be confined to this part, beneath the zone of\r\nmassive corals, minute encrusting corallines and other organic bodies\r\nlive. If we compare the external margin of the reef at Keeling atoll\r\nwith that on the leeward side of Mauritius, which are very differently\r\ncircumstanced, we shall find a corresponding difference in the\r\nappearance of the corals. At the latter place, the genus Madrepora is\r\npreponderant over every other kind, and beneath the zone of massive\r\ncorals there are large beds of Seriatopora. There is also a marked\r\ndifference, according to Captain Moresby,[14] between the great\r\nbranching corals of the Red Sea, and those on the reefs of the Maldiva\r\natolls.\r\n\r\n [14] Captain Moresby on the Northern Maldiva atolls, “Geographical\r\n Journal”, volume v., page 401.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese facts, which in themselves are deserving of notice, bear,\r\nperhaps, not very remotely, on a remarkable circumstance which has been\r\npointed out to me by Captain Moresby, namely, that with very few\r\nexceptions, none of the coral-knolls within the lagoons of Peros\r\nBanhos, Diego Garcia, and the Great Chagos Bank (all situated in the\r\nChagos group), rise to the surface of the water; whereas all those,\r\nwith equally few exceptions, within Solomon and Egmont atolls in the\r\nsame group, and likewise within the large southern Maldiva atolls,\r\nreach the surface. I make these statements, after having examined the\r\ncharts of each atoll. In the lagoon of Peros Banhos, which is nearly\r\ntwenty miles across, there is only one single reef which rises to the\r\nsurface; in Diego Garcia there are seven, but several of these lie\r\nclose to the margin of the lagoon, and need scarcely have been\r\nreckoned; in the Great Chagos Bank there is not one. On the other hand,\r\nin the lagoons of some of the great southern Maldiva atolls, although\r\nthickly studded with reefs, every one without exception rises to the\r\nsurface; and on an average there are less than two submerged reefs in\r\neach atoll; in the northern atolls, however, the submerged lagoon-reefs\r\nare not quite so rare. The submerged reefs in the Chagos atolls\r\ngenerally have from one to seven fathoms water on them, but some have\r\nfrom seven to ten. Most of them are small with very steep sides;[15] at\r\nPeros Banhos they rise from a depth of about thirty fathoms, and some\r\nof them in the Great Chagos Bank from above forty fathoms; they are\r\ncovered, Captain Moresby informs me, with living and healthy coral, two\r\nand three feet high, consisting of several species. Why then have not\r\nthese lagoon-reefs reached the surface, like the innumerable ones in\r\nthe atolls above named? If we attempt to assign any difference in their\r\nexternal conditions, as the cause of this diversity, we are at once\r\nbaffled. The lagoon of Diego Garcia is not deep, and is almost wholly\r\nsurrounded by its reef; Peros Banhos is very deep, much larger, with\r\nmany wide passages communicating with the open sea. On the other hand,\r\nof those atolls, in which all or nearly all the lagoon-reefs have\r\nreached the surface, some are small, others large, some shallow, others\r\ndeep, some well-enclosed, and others open.\r\n\r\n [15] Some of these statements were not communicated to me verbally by\r\n Captain Moresby, but are taken from the MS. account before alluded to,\r\n of the Chagos Group.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Moresby informs me that he has seen a French chart of Diego\r\nGarcia made eighty years before his survey, and apparently very\r\naccurate; and from it he infers, that during this interval there has\r\nnot been the smallest change in the depth on any of the knolls within\r\nthe lagoon. It is also known that during the last fifty-one years, the\r\neastern channel into the lagoon has neither become narrower, nor\r\ndecreased in depth; and as there are numerous small knolls of living\r\ncoral within it, some change might have been anticipated. Moreover, as\r\nthe whole reef round the lagoon of this atoll has been converted into\r\nland—an unparalleled case, I believe, in an atoll of such large\r\nsize,—and as the strip of land is for considerable spaces more than\r\nhalf a mile wide—also a very unusual circumstance,—we have the best\r\npossible evidence, that Diego Garcia has remained at its present level\r\nfor a very long period. With this fact, and with the knowledge that no\r\nsensible change has taken place during eighty years in the\r\ncoral-knolls, and considering that every single reef has reached the\r\nsurface in other atolls, which do not present the smallest appearance\r\nof being older than Diego Garcia and Peros Banhos, and which are placed\r\nunder the same external conditions with them, one is led to conclude\r\nthat these submerged reefs, although covered with luxuriant coral, have\r\nno tendency to grow upwards, and that they would remain at their\r\npresent levels for an almost indefinite period.\r\n\r\nFrom the number of these knolls, from their position, size, and form,\r\nmany of them being only one or two hundred yards across, with a rounded\r\noutline, and precipitous sides,—it is indisputable that they have been\r\nformed by the growth of coral; and this makes the case much more\r\nremarkable. In Peros Banhos and in the Great Chagos Bank, some of these\r\nalmost columnar masses are 200 feet high, and their summits lie only\r\nfrom two to eight fathoms beneath the surface; therefore, a small\r\nproportional amount more of growth would cause them to attain the\r\nsurface, like those numerous knolls, which rise from an equally great\r\ndepth within the Maldiva atolls. We can hardly suppose that time has\r\nbeen wanting for the upward growth of the coral, whilst in Diego\r\nGarcia, the broad annular strip of land, formed by the continued\r\naccumulation of detritus, shows how long this atoll has remained at its\r\npresent level. We must look to some other cause than the rate of\r\ngrowth; and I suspect it will be found in the reefs being formed of\r\ndifferent species of corals, adapted to live at different depths.\r\n\r\nThe Great Chagos Bank is situated in the centre of the Chagos Group,\r\nand the Pitt and Speaker Banks at its two extreme points. These banks\r\nresemble atolls, except in their external rim being about eight fathoms\r\nsubmerged, and in being formed of dead rock, with very little living\r\ncoral on it: a portion nine miles long of the annular reef of Peros\r\nBanhos atoll is in the same condition. These facts, as will hereafter\r\nbe shown, render it very probable that the whole group at some former\r\nperiod subsided seven or eight fathoms; and that the coral perished on\r\nthe outer margin of those atolls which are now submerged, but that it\r\ncontinued alive, and grew up to the surface on those which are now\r\nperfect. If these atolls did subside, and if from the suddenness of the\r\nmovement or from any other cause, those corals which are better adapted\r\nto live at a certain depth than at the surface, once got possession of\r\nthe knolls, supplanting the former occupants, they would exert little\r\nor no tendency to grow upwards. To illustrate this, I may observe, that\r\nif the corals of the upper zone on the outer edge of Keeling atoll were\r\nto perish, it is improbable that those of the lower zone would grow to\r\nthe surface, and thus become exposed to conditions for which they do\r\nnot appear to be adapted. The conjecture, that the corals on the\r\nsubmerged knolls within the Chagos atolls have analogous habits with\r\nthose of the lower zone outside Keeling atoll, receives some support\r\nfrom a remark by Captain Moresby, namely, that they have a different\r\nappearance from those on the reefs in the Maldiva atolls, which, as we\r\nhave seen, all rise to the surface: he compares the kind of difference\r\nto that of the vegetation under different climates. I have entered at\r\nconsiderable length into this case, although unable to throw much light\r\non it, in order to show that an equal tendency to upward growth ought\r\nnot to be attributed to all coral-reefs,—to those situated at different\r\ndepths,—to those forming the ring of an atoll or those on the knolls\r\nwithin a lagoon,—to those in one area and those in another. The\r\ninference, therefore, that one reef could not grow up to the surface\r\nwithin a given time, because another, not known to be covered with the\r\nsame species of corals, and not known to be placed under conditions\r\nexactly the same, has not within the same time reached the surface, is\r\nunsound.\r\n\r\nSECTION II.—ON THE RATE OF GROWTH OF CORAL-REEFS.\r\n\r\nThe remark made at the close of the last section, naturally leads to\r\nthis division of our subject, which has not, I think, hitherto been\r\nconsidered under a right point of view. Ehrenberg[16] has stated, that\r\nin the Red Sea, the corals only coat other rocks in a layer from one to\r\ntwo feet in thickness, or at most to a fathom and a half; and he\r\ndisbelieves that, in any case, they form, by their own proper growth,\r\ngreat masses, stratum over stratum. A nearly similar observation has\r\nbeen made by MM. Quoy and Gaimard,[17] with respect to the thickness of\r\nsome upraised beds of coral, which they examined at Timor and some\r\nother places. Ehrenberg[18] saw certain large massive corals in the Red\r\nSea, which he imagines to be of such vast antiquity, that they might\r\nhave been beheld by Pharaoh; and according to Mr. Lyell[19] there are\r\ncertain corals at Bermuda, which are known by tradition, to have been\r\nliving for centuries. To show how slowly coral-reefs grow upwards,\r\nCaptain Beechey[20] has adduced the case of the Dolphin Reef off\r\nTahiti, which has remained at the same depth beneath the surface,\r\nnamely about two fathoms and a half, for a period of sixty-seven years.\r\nThere are reefs in the Red Sea, which certainly do not appear[21] to\r\nhave increased in dimensions during the last half-century, and from the\r\ncomparison of old charts with recent surveys, probably not during the\r\nlast two hundred years. These, and other similar facts, have so\r\nstrongly impressed many with the belief of the extreme slowness of the\r\ngrowth of corals, that they have even doubted the possibility of\r\nislands in the great oceans having been formed by their agency. Others,\r\nagain, who have not been overwhelmed by this difficulty, have admitted\r\nthat it would require thousands, and tens of thousands of years, to\r\nform a mass, even of inconsiderable thickness; but the subject has not,\r\nI believe, been viewed in the proper light.\r\n\r\n [16] Ehrenberg, as before cited, pages 39, 46, and 50.\r\n\r\n\r\n [17] “Annales des Sciences Nat.” tom. vi., page 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n [18] Ehrenberg, ut sup., page 42.\r\n\r\n\r\n [19] Lyell’s “Principles of Geology,” book iii., chapter xviii.\r\n\r\n\r\n [20] Beechey’s “Voyage to the Pacific,” chapter viii.\r\n\r\n\r\n [21] Ehrenberg, ut sup., page 43.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat masses of considerable thickness have been formed by the growth of\r\ncoral, may be inferred with certainty from the following facts. In the\r\ndeep lagoons of Peros Banhos and of the Great Chagos Bank, there are,\r\nas already described, small steep-sided knolls covered with living\r\ncoral. There are similar knolls in the southern Maldiva atolls, some of\r\nwhich, as Captain Moresby assures me, are less than a hundred yards in\r\ndiameter, and rise to the surface from a depth of between two hundred\r\nand fifty and three hundred feet. Considering their number, form, and\r\nposition, it would be preposterous to suppose that they are based on\r\npinnacles of any rock, not of coral formation; or that sediment could\r\nhave been heaped up into such small and steep isolated cones. As no\r\nkind of living coral grows above the height of a few feet, we are\r\ncompelled to suppose that these knolls have been formed by the\r\nsuccessive growth and death of many individuals,—first one being broken\r\noff or killed by some accident, and then another, and one set of\r\nspecies being replaced by another set with different habits, as the\r\nreef rose nearer the surface, or as other changes supervened. The\r\nspaces between the corals would become filled up with fragments and\r\nsand, and such matter would probably soon be consolidated, for we learn\r\nfrom Lieutenant Nelson,[22] that at Bermuda a process of this kind\r\ntakes place beneath water, without the aid of evaporation. In reefs,\r\nalso, of the barrier class, we may feel sure, as I have shown, that\r\nmasses of great thickness have been formed by the growth of the coral;\r\nin the case of Vanikoro, judging only from the depth of the moat\r\nbetween the land and the reef, the wall of coral-rock must be at least\r\nthree hundred feet in vertical thickness.\r\n\r\n [22] “Geological Transactions,” volume v., page 113.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate that the upraised coral-islands in the Pacific have\r\nnot been examined by a geologist. The cliffs of Elizabeth Island, in\r\nthe Low Archipelago, are eighty feet high, and appear, from Captain\r\nBeechey’s description, to consist of a homogeneous coral-rock. From the\r\nisolated position of this island, we may safely infer that it is an\r\nupraised atoll, and therefore that it has been formed by masses of\r\ncoral, grown together. Savage Island seems, from the description of the\r\nyounger Forster,[23] to have a similar structure, and its shores are\r\nabout forty feet high: some of the Cook Islands also appear[24] to be\r\nsimilarly composed. Captain Belcher, R.N., in a letter which Captain\r\nBeaufort showed me at the admiralty, speaking of Bow atoll, says, “I\r\nhave succeeded in boring forty-five feet through coral-sand, when the\r\nauger became jammed by the falling in of the surrounding _creamy_\r\nmatter.” On one of the Maldiva atolls, Captain Moresby bored to a depth\r\nof twenty-six feet, when his auger also broke: he has had the kindness\r\nto give me the matter brought up; it is perfectly white, and like\r\nfinely triturated coral-rock.\r\n\r\n [23] Forster’s “Voyage round the World with Cook,” volume ii., pages\r\n 163, 167.\r\n\r\n\r\n [24] Williams’s “Narrative of Missionary Enterprise,” page 30.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my description of Keeling atoll, I have given some facts, which show\r\nthat the reef probably has grown outwards; and I have found, just\r\nwithin the outer margin, the great mounds of Porites and of Millepora,\r\nwith their summits lately killed, and their sides subsequently\r\nthickened by the growth of the coral: a layer, also, of Nullipora had\r\nalready coated the dead surface. As the external slope of the reef is\r\nthe same round the whole of this atoll, and round many other atolls,\r\nthe angle of inclination must result from an adaption between the\r\ngrowing powers of the coral, and the force of the breakers, and their\r\naction on the loose sediment. The reef, therefore, could not increase\r\noutwards, without a nearly equal addition to every part of the slope,\r\nso that the original inclination might be preserved, and this would\r\nrequire a large amount of sediment, all derived from the wear of corals\r\nand shells, to be added to the lower part. Moreover, at Keeling atoll,\r\nand probably in many other cases, the different kinds of corals would\r\nhave to encroach on each other; thus the Nulliporæ cannot increase\r\noutwards without encroaching on the Porites and _Millepora complanata_,\r\nas is now taking place; nor these latter without encroaching on the\r\nstrongly branched Madreporet, the _Millepora alcicornis_, and some\r\nAstræas; nor these again without a foundation being formed for them\r\nwithin the requisite depth, by the accumulation of sediment. How slow,\r\nthen, must be the ordinary lateral or outward growth of such reefs. But\r\noff Christmas atoll, where the sea is much more shallow than is usual,\r\nwe have good reason to believe that, within a period not very remote,\r\nthe reef has increased considerably in width. The land has the\r\nextraordinary breadth of three miles; it consists of parallel ridges of\r\nshells and broken corals, which furnish “an incontestable proof,” as\r\nobserved by Cook,[25] “that the island has been produced by accessions\r\nfrom the sea, and is in a state of increase.” The land is fronted by a\r\ncoral-reef, and from the manner in which islets are known to be formed,\r\nwe may feel confident that the reef was not three miles wide, when the\r\nfirst, or most backward ridge, was thrown up; and, therefore, we must\r\nconclude that the reef has grown outwards during the accumulation of\r\nthe successive ridges. Here then, a wall of coral-rock of very\r\nconsiderable breadth has been formed by the outward growth of the\r\nliving margin, within a period during which ridges of shells and\r\ncorals, lying on the bare surface, have not decayed. There can be\r\nlittle doubt, from the account given by Captain Beechey, that Matilda\r\natoll, in the Low Archipelago, has been converted in the space of\r\nthirty-four years, from being, as described by the crew of a wrecked\r\nwhaling vessel, a “reef of rocks” into a lagoon-island, fourteen miles\r\nin length, with “one of its sides covered nearly the whole way with\r\nhigh trees.”[26] The islets, also, on Keeling atoll, it has been shown,\r\nhave increased in length, and since the construction of an old chart,\r\nseveral of them have become united into one long islet; but in this\r\ncase, and in that of Matilda atoll, we have no proof, and can only\r\ninfer as probable, that the reef, that is the foundation of the islets,\r\nhas increased as well as the islets themselves.\r\n\r\n [25] Cook’s “Third Voyage,” book III., chapter x.\r\n\r\n\r\n [26] Beechey’s “Voyage to the Pacific,” chapter vii. and viii.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter these considerations, I attach little importance, as indicating\r\nthe ordinary and still less the possible rate of _outward_ growth of\r\ncoral-reefs, to the fact that certain reefs in the Red Sea have not\r\nincreased during a long interval of time; or to other such cases, as\r\nthat of Ouluthy atoll in the Caroline group, where every islet,\r\ndescribed a thousand years before by Cantova was found in the same\r\nstate by Lutké,[27]—without it could be shown that, in these cases, the\r\nconditions were favourable to the vigorous and unopposed growth of the\r\ncorals living in the different zones of depth, and that a proper basis\r\nfor the extent of the reef was present. The former conditions must\r\ndepend on many contingencies, and in the deep oceans where coral\r\nformations most abound, a basis within the requisite depth can rarely\r\nbe present.\r\n\r\n [27] F. Lutké’s “Voyage autour du Monde.” In the group Elato, however,\r\n it appears that what is now the islet Falipi, is called in Cantova’s\r\n Chart, the Banc de Falipi. It is not stated whether this has been\r\n caused by the growth of coral, or by the accumulation of sand.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor do I attach any importance to the fact of certain submerged reefs,\r\nas those off Tahiti, or those within Diego Garcia not now being nearer\r\nthe surface than they were many years ago, as an indication of the rate\r\nunder favourable circumstances of the _upward_ growth of reefs; after\r\nit has been shown, that all the reefs have grown to the surface in some\r\nof the Chagos atolls, but that in neighbouring atolls which appear to\r\nbe of equal antiquity and to be exposed to the same external\r\nconditions, every reef remains submerged; for we are almost driven to\r\nattribute this to a difference, not in the rate of growth, but in the\r\nhabits of the corals in the two cases.\r\n\r\nIn an old-standing reef, the corals, which are so different in kind on\r\ndifferent parts of it, are probably all adapted to the stations they\r\noccupy, and hold their places, like other organic beings, by a struggle\r\none with another, and with external nature; hence we may infer that\r\ntheir growth would generally be slow, except under peculiarly\r\nfavourable circumstances. Almost the only natural condition, allowing a\r\nquick upward growth of the whole surface of a reef, would be a slow\r\nsubsidence of the area in which it stood; if, for instance, Keeling\r\natoll were to subside two or three feet, can we doubt that the\r\nprojecting margin of live coral, about half an inch in thickness, which\r\nsurrounds the dead upper surfaces of the mounds of Porites, would in\r\nthis case form a concentric layer over them, and the reef thus increase\r\nupwards, instead of, as at present, outwards? The Nulliporæ are now\r\nencroaching on the Porites and Millepora, but in this case might we not\r\nconfidently expect that the latter would, in their turn, encroach on\r\nthe Nulliporæ? After a subsidence of this kind, the sea would gain on\r\nthe islets, and the great fields of dead but upright corals in the\r\nlagoon, would be covered by a sheet of clear water; and might we not\r\nthen expect that these reefs would rise to the surface, as they\r\nanciently did when the lagoon was less confined by islets, and as they\r\ndid within a period of ten years in the schooner-channel, cut by the\r\ninhabitants? In one of the Maldiva atolls, a reef, which within a very\r\nfew years existed as an islet bearing cocoa-nut trees, was found by\r\nLieutenant Prentice “_entirely covered with live coral and Madrepore_.”\r\nThe natives believe that the islet was washed away by a change in the\r\ncurrents, but if, instead of this, it had quietly subsided, surely\r\nevery part of the island which offered a solid foundation, would in a\r\nlike manner have become coated with living coral.\r\n\r\nThrough steps such as these, any thickness of rock, composed of a\r\nsingular intermixture of various kinds of corals, shells, and\r\ncalcareous sediment, might be formed; but without subsidence, the\r\nthickness would necessarily be determined by the depth at which the\r\nreef-building polypifers can exist. If it be asked, at what rate in\r\nyears I suppose a reef of coral favourably circumstanced could grow up\r\nfrom a given depth; I should answer, that we have no precise evidence\r\non this point, and comparatively little concern with it. We see, in\r\ninnumerable points over wide areas, that the rate has been sufficient,\r\neither to bring up the reefs from various depths to the surface, or, as\r\nis more probable, to keep them at the surface, during progressive\r\nsubsidences; and this is a much more important standard of comparison\r\nthan any cycle of years.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be inferred from the following facts, that the rate in\r\nyears under favourable circumstances would be very far from slow. Dr.\r\nAllan, of Forres, has, in his MS. Thesis deposited in the library of\r\nthe Edinburgh University (extracts from which I owe to the kindness of\r\nDr. Malcolmson), the following account of some experiments, which he\r\ntried during his travels in the years 1830 to 1832 on the east coast of\r\nMadagascar. “To ascertain the rise and progress of the coral-family,\r\nand fix the number of species met with at Foul Point (latitude 17° 40′)\r\ntwenty species of coral were taken off the reef and planted apart on a\r\nsand-bank _three feet deep at low water_. Each portion weighed ten\r\npounds, and was kept in its place by stakes. Similar quantities were\r\nplaced in a clump and secured as the rest. This was done in December\r\n1830. In July following, each detached mass was nearly level with the\r\nsea at low water, quite immovable, and several feet long, stretching as\r\nthe parent reef, with the coast current from north to south. The masses\r\naccumulated in a clump were found equally increased, but some of the\r\nspecies in such unequal ratios, as to be growing over each other.” The\r\nloss of Dr. Allan’s magnificent collection by shipwreck, unfortunately\r\nprevents its being known to what genera these corals belonged; but from\r\nthe numbers experimented on, it is certain that all the more\r\nconspicuous kinds must have been included. Dr. Allan informs me, in a\r\nletter, that he believes it was a Madrepora, which grew most\r\nvigorously. One may be permitted to suspect that the level of the sea\r\nmight possibly have been somewhat different at the two stated periods;\r\nnevertheless, it is quite evident that the growth of the ten-pound\r\nmasses, during the six or seven months, at the end of which they were\r\nfound immovably fixed[28] and several feet in length, must have been\r\nvery great. The fact of the different kinds of coral, when placed in\r\none clump, having increased in extremely unequal ratios, is very\r\ninteresting, as it shows the manner in which a reef, supporting many\r\nspecies of coral, would probably be affected by a change in the\r\nexternal conditions favouring one kind more than another. The growth of\r\nthe masses of coral in N. and S. lines parallel to the prevailing\r\ncurrents, whether due to the drifting of sediment or to the simple\r\nmovement of the water, is, also, a very interesting circumstance.\r\n\r\n [28] It is stated by De la Beche (“Geological Manual,” page 143), on\r\n the authority of Mr. Lloyd, who surveyed the Isthmus of Panama, that\r\n some specimens of Polypifers, placed by him in a sheltered pool of\r\n water, were found in the course of a few days firmly fixed by the\r\n secretion of a stony matter, to the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nA fact, communicated to me by Lieutenant Wellstead, I.N., in some\r\ndegree corroborates the result of Dr. Allan’s experiments: it is, that\r\nin the Persian Gulf a ship had her copper bottom encrusted in the\r\ncourse of twenty months with a layer of coral, _two feet_ in thickness,\r\nwhich it required great force to remove, when the vessel was docked: it\r\nwas not ascertained to what order this coral belonged. The case of the\r\nschooner-channel choked up with coral in an interval of less than ten\r\nyears, in the lagoon of Keeling atoll, should be here borne in mind. We\r\nmay also infer, from the trouble which the inhabitants of the Maldiva\r\natolls take to root out, as they express it, the coral-knolls from\r\ntheir harbours, that their growth can hardly be very slow.[29]\r\n\r\n [29] Mr. Stutchbury (“West of England Journal”, No. I., page 50.) has\r\n described a specimen of Agaricia, “weighing 2 lbs. 9 oz., which\r\n surrounds a species of oyster, whose age could not be more than two\r\n years, and yet is completely enveloped by this dense coral.” I presume\r\n that the oyster was living when the specimen was procured; otherwise\r\n the fact tells nothing. Mr. Stutchbury also mentions an anchor, which\r\n had become entirely encrusted with coral in fifty years; other cases,\r\n however, are recorded of anchors which have long remained amidst\r\n coral-reefs without having become coated. The anchor of the _Beagle_,\r\n in 1832, after having been down exactly one month at Rio de Janeiro,\r\n was so thickly coated by two species of Tubularia, that large spaces\r\n of the iron were entirely concealed; the tufts of this horny zoophyte\r\n were between two and three inches in length. It has been attempted to\r\n compute, but I believe erroneously, the rate of growth of a reef, from\r\n the fact mentioned by Captain Beechey, of the _Chama gigas_ being\r\n embedded in coral-rock. But it should be remembered, that some species\r\n of this genus invariably live, both whilst young and old, in cavities,\r\n which the animal has the power of enlarging with its growth. I saw\r\n many of these shells thus embedded in the outer “flat” of Keeling\r\n atoll, which is composed of dead rock; and therefore the cavities in\r\n this case had no relation whatever with the growth of coral. M.\r\n Lesson, also, speaking of this shell (Partie Zoolog. “Voyage de la\r\n ‘Coquille’”), has remarked, “que constamment ses valves étaient\r\n engagés complètement dans la masse des Madrepores.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the facts given in this section, it may be concluded, first, that\r\nconsiderable thicknesses of rock have certainly been formed within the\r\npresent geological area by the growth of coral and the accumulation of\r\nits detritus; and, secondly, that the increase of individual corals and\r\nof reefs, both outwards or horizontally and upwards or vertically,\r\nunder the peculiar conditions favourable to such increase, is not slow,\r\nwhen referred either to the standard of the average oscillations of\r\nlevel in the earth’s crust, or to the more precise but less important\r\none of a cycle of years.\r\n\r\nSECTION III.—ON THE DEPTHS AT WHICH REEF-BUILDING POLYPIFERS CAN LIVE.\r\n\r\nI have already described in detail, which might have appeared trivial,\r\nthe nature of the bottom of the sea immediately surrounding Keeling\r\natoll; and I will now describe with almost equal care the soundings off\r\nthe fringing-reefs of Mauritius. I have preferred this arrangement, for\r\nthe sake of grouping together facts of a similar nature. I sounded with\r\nthe wide bell-shaped lead which Captain Fitzroy used at Keeling Island,\r\nbut my examination of the bottom was confined to a few miles of coast\r\n(between Port Louis and Tomb Bay) on the leeward side of the island.\r\nThe edge of the reef is formed of great shapeless masses of branching\r\nMadrepores, which chiefly consist of two species,—apparently _M.\r\ncorymbosa_ and _pocillifera_,— mingled with a few other kinds of coral.\r\nThese masses are separated from each other by the most irregular\r\ngullies and cavities, into which the lead sinks many feet. Outside this\r\nirregular border of Madrepores, the water deepens gradually to twenty\r\nfathoms, which depth generally is found at the distance of from half to\r\nthree-quarters of a mile from the reef. A little further out the depth\r\nis thirty fathoms, and thence the bank slopes rapidly into the depths\r\nof the ocean. This inclination is very gentle compared with that\r\noutside Keeling and other atolls, but compared with most coasts it is\r\nsteep. The water was so clear outside the reef, that I could\r\ndistinguish every object forming the rugged bottom. In this part, and\r\nto a depth of eight fathoms, I sounded repeatedly, and at each cast\r\npounded the bottom with the broad lead, nevertheless the arming\r\ninvariably came up perfectly clean, but deeply indented. From eight to\r\nfifteen fathoms a little calcareous sand was occasionally brought up,\r\nbut more frequently the arming was simply indented. In all this space\r\nthe two Madrepores above mentioned, and two species of Astræa, with\r\nrather large[30] stars, seemed the commonest kinds; and it must be\r\nnoticed that twice at the depth of fifteen fathoms, the arming was\r\nmarked with a clean impression of an Astræa. Besides these lithophytes,\r\nsome fragments of the _Millepora alcicornis_, which occurs in the same\r\nrelative position at Keeling Island, were brought up; and in the deeper\r\nparts there were large beds of a Seriatopora, different from _S.\r\nsubulata_, but closely allied to it. On the beach within the reef, the\r\nrolled fragments consisted chiefly of the corals just mentioned, and of\r\na massive Porites, like that at Keeling atoll, of a Meandrina,\r\n_Pocillopora verrucosa_, and of numerous fragments of Nullipora. From\r\nfifteen to twenty fathoms the bottom was, with few exceptions, either\r\nformed of sand, or thickly covered with Seriatopora: this delicate\r\ncoral seems to form at these depths extensive beds unmingled with any\r\nother kind. At twenty fathoms, one sounding brought up a fragment of\r\nMadrepora apparently _M. pocillifera_, and I believe it is the same\r\nspecies (for I neglected to bring specimens from both stations) which\r\nmainly forms the upper margin of the reef; if so, it grows in depths\r\nvarying from 0 to 20 fathoms. Between 20 and 23 fathoms I obtained\r\nseveral soundings, and they all showed a sandy bottom, with one\r\nexception at 30 fathoms, when the arming came up scooped out, as if by\r\nthe margin of a large Caryophyllia. Beyond 33 fathoms I sounded only\r\nonce; and from 86 fathoms, at the distance of one mile and a third from\r\nthe edge of the reef, the arming brought up calcareous sand with a\r\npebble of volcanic rock. The circumstance of the arming having\r\ninvariably come up quite clean, when sounding within a certain number\r\nof fathoms off the reefs of Mauritius and Keeling atoll (eight fathoms\r\nin the former case, and twelve in the latter) and of its having always\r\ncome up (with one exception) smoothed and covered with sand, when the\r\ndepth exceeded twenty fathoms, probably indicates a criterion, by which\r\nthe limits of the vigorous growth of coral might in all cases be\r\nreadily ascertained. I do not, however, suppose that if a vast number\r\nof soundings were obtained round these islands, the limit above\r\nassigned would be found never to vary, but I conceive the facts are\r\nsufficient to show, that the exceptions would be few. The circumstance\r\nof a _gradual_ change, in the two cases, from a field of clean coral to\r\na smooth sandy bottom, is far more important in indicating the depth at\r\nwhich the larger kinds of coral flourish than almost any number of\r\nseparate observations on the depth, at which certain species have been\r\ndredged up. For we can understand the gradation, only as a prolonged\r\nstruggle against unfavourable conditions. If a person were to find the\r\nsoil clothed with turf on the banks of a stream of water, but on going\r\nto some distance on one side of it, he observed the blades of grass\r\ngrowing thinner and thinner, with intervening patches of sand, until he\r\nentered a desert of sand, he would safely conclude, especially if\r\nchanges of the same kind were noticed in other places, that the\r\npresence of the water was absolutely necessary to the formation of a\r\nthick bed of turf: so may we conclude, with the same feeling of\r\ncertainty, that thick beds of coral are formed only at small depths\r\nbeneath the surface of the sea.\r\n\r\n [30] Since the preceding pages were printed off, I have received from\r\n Mr. Lyell a very interesting pamphlet, entitled “Remarks upon Coral\r\n Formations,” etc., by J. Couthouy, Boston, United States, 1842. There\r\n is a statement (page 6), on the authority of the Rev. J. Williams,\r\n corroborating the remarks made by Ehrenberg and Lyell (page 71 of this\r\n volume), on the antiquity of certain individual corals in the Red Sea\r\n and at Bermuda; namely, that at Upolu, one of the Navigator Islands,\r\n “particular clumps of coral are known to the fishermen by name,\r\n derived from either some particular configuration or tradition\r\n attached to them, and handed down from time immemorial.” With respect\r\n to the thickness of masses of coral-rock, it clearly appears, from the\r\n descriptions given by Mr. Couthouy (pages 34, 58) that Mangaia and\r\n Aurora Islands are upraised atolls, composed of coral rock: the level\r\n summit of the former is about three hundred feet, and that of Aurora\r\n Island is two hundred feet above the sea-level.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have endeavoured to collect every fact, which might either invalidate\r\nor corroborate this conclusion. Captain Moresby, whose opportunities\r\nfor observation during his survey of the Maldiva and Chagos\r\nArchipelagoes have been unrivalled, informs me, that the upper part or\r\nzone of the steep-sided reefs, on the inner and outer coasts of the\r\natolls in both groups, invariably consists of coral, and the lower\r\nparts of sand. At seven or eight fathoms depth, the bottom is formed,\r\nas could be seen through the clear water, of great living masses of\r\ncoral, which at about ten fathoms generally stand some way apart from\r\neach other, with patches of white sand between them, and at a little\r\ngreater depth these patches become united into a smooth steep slope,\r\nwithout any coral. Captain Moresby, also, informs me in support of his\r\nstatement, that he found only decayed coral on the Padua Bank (northern\r\npart of the Laccadive group) which has an average depth between\r\ntwenty-five and thirty-five fathoms, but that on some other banks in\r\nthe same group with only ten or twelve fathoms water on them (for\r\ninstance, the Tillacapeni bank), the coral was living.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the coral-reefs in the Red Sea, Ehrenberg has the\r\nfollowing passage:—“The living corals do not descend there into great\r\ndepths. On the edges of islets and near reefs, where the depth was\r\nsmall, very many lived; but we found no more even at six fathoms. The\r\npearl-fishers at Yemen and Massaua asserted that there was no coral\r\nnear the pearl-banks at nine fathoms depth, but only sand. We were not\r\nable to institute any more special researches.”[31] I am, however,\r\nassured both by Captain Moresby and Lieutenant Wellstead, that in the\r\nmore northern parts of the Red Sea, there are extensive beds of living\r\ncoral at a depth of twenty-five fathoms, in which the anchors of their\r\nvessels were frequently entangled. Captain Moresby attributes the less\r\ndepth, at which the corals are able to live in the places mentioned by\r\nEhrenberg, to the greater quantity of sediment there; and the\r\nsituations, where they were flourishing at the depth of twenty-five\r\nfathoms, were protected, and the water was extraordinarily limpid. On\r\nthe leeward side of Mauritius where I found the coral growing at a\r\nsomewhat greater depth than at Keeling atoll, the sea, owing apparently\r\nto its tranquil state, was likewise very clear. Within the lagoons of\r\nsome of the Marshall atolls, where the water can be but little\r\nagitated, there are, according to Kotzebue, living beds of coral in\r\ntwenty-five fathoms. From these facts, and considering the manner in\r\nwhich the beds of clean coral off Mauritius, Keeling Island, the\r\nMaldiva and Chagos atolls, graduated into a sandy slope, it appears\r\nvery probable that the depth, at which reef-building polypifers can\r\nexist, is partly determined by the extent of inclined surface, which\r\nthe currents of the sea and the recoiling waves have the power to keep\r\nfree from sediment.\r\n\r\n [31] Ehrenberg, “Über die Natür,” &c., page 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nMM. Quoy and Gaimard[32] believe that the growth of coral is confined\r\nwithin very limited depths; and they state that they never found any\r\nfragment of an Astræa (the genus they consider most efficient in\r\nforming reefs) at a depth above twenty-five or thirty feet. But we have\r\nseen that in several places the bottom of the sea is paved with massive\r\ncorals at more than twice this depth; and at fifteen fathoms (or twice\r\nthis depth) off the reefs of Mauritius, the arming was marked with the\r\ndistinct impression of a living Astræa. _Millepora alcicornis_ lives in\r\nfrom 0 to 12 fathoms, and the genera Madrepora and Seriatopora from 0\r\nto 20 fathoms. Captain Moresby has given me a specimen of _Sideropora\r\nscabra_ (Porites of Lamarck) brought up alive from 17 fathoms. Mr.\r\nCouthouy[33] states that he has dredged up on the Bahama banks\r\nconsiderable masses of Meandrina from 16 fathoms, and he has seen this\r\ncoral growing in 20 fathoms. A Caryophyllia, half an inch in diameter,\r\nwas dredged up alive from 80 fathoms off Juan Fernandez (latitude 33°\r\nS.) by Captain P.P. King:[34] this is the most remarkable fact with\r\nwhich I am acquainted, showing the depth at which a genus of corals\r\noften found on reefs, can exist.[35] We ought, however, to feel less\r\nsurprise at this fact, as Caryophyllia alone of the lamelliform genera,\r\nranges far beyond the tropics; it is found in Zetland (Fleming’s\r\n“British Animals,” genus Caryophyllia.) in Latitude 60° N. in deep\r\nwater, and I procured a small species from Tierra del Fuego in Latitude\r\n53° S. Captain Beechey informs me, that branches of pink and yellow\r\ncoral were frequently brought up from between twenty and twenty-five\r\nfathoms off the Low atolls; and Lieutenant Stokes, writing to me from\r\nthe N.W. coast of Australia, says that a strongly branched coral was\r\nprocured there from thirty fathoms; unfortunately it is not known to\r\nwhat genera these corals belong.\r\n\r\n [32] “Annales des Sci. Nat.” tom. vi.\r\n\r\n\r\n [33] “Remarks on Coral Formations,” page 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n [34] I am indebted to Mr. Stokes for having kindly communicated this\r\n fact to me, together with much other valuable information.\r\n\r\n\r\n [35] I will record in the form of a note all the facts that I have\r\n been able to collect on the depths, both within and without the\r\n tropics, at which those corals and corallines can live, which there is\r\n no reason to suppose ever materially aid in the construction of a\r\n reef.\r\n\r\nNAME OF ZOOPHYTE       Depth in fathoms     COUNTRY and S.

Hist. of Coralline,” page 96) states that Ombellularia was\r\nprocured in latitude 79° N. _sticking_ to a _line_ from the depth of\r\n236 fathoms; hence this coral either must have been floating loose, or\r\nwas entangled in stray line at the bottom. Off Keeling atoll a compound\r\nAscidia (Sigillina) was brought up from 39 fathoms, and a piece of\r\nsponge, apparently living, from 70, and a fragment of Nullipora also\r\napparently living from 92 fathoms. At a greater depth than 90 fathoms\r\noff this coral island, the bottom was thickly strewed with joints of\r\nHalimeda and small fragments of other Nulliporæ, but all dead. Captain\r\nB. Allen, R.N., informs me that in the survey of the West Indies it was\r\nnoticed that between the depth of 10 and 200 fathoms, the sounding lead\r\nvery generally came up coated with the dead joints of a Halimeda, of\r\nwhich he showed me specimens. Off Pernambuco, in Brazil, in about\r\ntwelve fathoms, the bottom was covered with fragments dead and alive of\r\na dull red Nullipora, and I infer from Roussin’s chart, that a bottom\r\nof this kind extends over a wide area. On the beach, within the\r\ncoral-reefs of Mauritius, vast quantities of fragments of Nulliporæ\r\nwere piled up. From these facts it appears, that these simply organized\r\nbodies are amongst the most abundant productions of the sea.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the limit of depth, at which each particular kind of coral\r\nceases to exist, is far from being accurately known; yet when we bear\r\nin mind the manner in which the clumps of coral gradually became\r\ninfrequent at about the same depth, and wholly disappeared at a greater\r\ndepth than twenty fathoms, on the slope round Keeling atoll, on the\r\nleeward side of the Mauritius, and at rather less depth, both without\r\nand within the atolls of the Maldiva and Chagos Archipelagoes; and when\r\nwe know that the reefs round these islands do not differ from other\r\ncoral formations in their form and structure, we may, I think, conclude\r\nthat in ordinary cases, reef-building polypifers do not flourish at\r\ngreater depths than between twenty and thirty fathoms.\r\n\r\nIt has been argued[36] that reefs may possibly rise from very great\r\ndepths through the means of small corals, first making a platform for\r\nthe growth of the stronger kinds. This, however, is an arbitrary\r\nsupposition: it is not always remembered, that in such cases there is\r\nan antagonist power in action, namely, the decay of organic bodies,\r\nwhen not protected by a covering of sediment, or by their own rapid\r\ngrowth. We have, moreover, no right to calculate on unlimited time for\r\nthe accumulation of small organic bodies into great masses. Every fact\r\nin geology proclaims that neither the land, nor the bed of the sea\r\nretain for indefinite periods the same level. As well might it be\r\nimagined that the British Seas would in time become choked up with beds\r\nof oysters, or that the numerous small corallines off the inhospitable\r\nshores of Tierra del Fuego would in time form a solid and extensive\r\ncoral-reef.\r\n\r\n [36] “Journal of the Royal Geographical Society,” 1831, page 218.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF THE FORMATION OF THE DIFFERENT CLASSES OF CORAL-REEFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe atolls of the larger archipelagoes are not formed on submerged\r\ncraters, or on banks of sediment.—Immense areas interspersed with\r\natolls.—Their subsidence.—The effects of storms and earthquakes on\r\natolls.—Recent changes in their state.—The origin of barrier-reefs and\r\nof atolls.—Their relative forms.—The step-formed ledges and walls round\r\nthe shores of some lagoons.—The ring-formed reefs of the Maldiva\r\natolls.—The submerged condition of parts or of the whole of some\r\nannular reefs.—The disseverment of large atolls.—The union of atolls by\r\nlinear reefs.—The Great Chagos Bank.—Objections from the area and\r\namount of subsidence required by the theory, considered.—The probable\r\ncomposition of the lower parts of atolls.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe naturalists who have visited the Pacific, seem to have had their\r\nattention riveted by the lagoon-islands, or atolls,—those singular\r\nrings of coral-land which rise abruptly out of the unfathomable\r\nocean—and have passed over, almost unnoticed, the scarcely less\r\nwonderful encircling barrier-reefs. The theory most generally received\r\non the formation of atolls, is that they are based on submarine\r\ncraters; but where can we find a crater of the shape of Bow atoll,\r\nwhich is five times as long as it is broad (Plate I., Figure 4); or\r\nlike that of Menchikoff Island (Plate II., Figure 3.), with its three\r\nloops, together sixty miles in length; or like Rimsky Korsacoff,\r\nnarrow, crooked, and fifty-four miles long; or like the northern\r\nMaldiva atolls, made up of numerous ring-formed reefs, placed on the\r\nmargin of a disc,—one of which discs is eighty-eight miles in length,\r\nand only from ten to twenty in breadth? It is, also, not a little\r\nimprobable, that there should have existed as many craters of immense\r\nsize crowded together beneath the sea, as there are now in some parts\r\natolls. But this theory lies under a greater difficulty, as will be\r\nevident, when we consider on what foundations the atolls of the larger\r\narchipelagoes rest: nevertheless, if the rim of a crater afforded a\r\nbasis at the proper depth, I am far from denying that a reef like a\r\nperfectly characterised atoll might not be formed; some such, perhaps,\r\nnow exist; but I cannot believe in the possibility of the greater\r\nnumber having thus originated.\r\n\r\nAn earlier and better theory was proposed by Chamisso;[1] he supposes\r\nthat as the more massive kinds of corals prefer the surf, the outer\r\nportions, in a reef rising from a submarine basis, would first reach\r\nthe surface and consequently form a ring. But on this view it must be\r\nassumed, that in every case the basis consists of a flat bank; for if\r\nit were conically formed, like a mountainous mass, we can see no reason\r\nwhy the coral should spring up from the flanks, instead of from the\r\ncentral and highest parts: considering the number of the atolls in the\r\nPacific and Indian Oceans, this assumption is very improbable. As the\r\nlagoons of atolls are sometimes even more than forty fathoms deep, it\r\nmust, also, be assumed on this view, that at a depth at which the waves\r\ndo not break, the coral grows more vigorously on the edges of a bank\r\nthan on its central part; and this is an assumption without any\r\nevidence in support of it. I remarked, in the third chapter, that a\r\nreef, growing on a detached bank, would tend to assume an atoll-like\r\nstructure; if, therefore, corals were to grow up from a bank, with a\r\nlevel surface some fathoms submerged, having steep sides and being\r\nsituated in a deep sea, a reef not to be distinguished from an atoll,\r\nmight be formed: I believe some such exist in the West Indies. But a\r\ndifficulty of the same kind with that affecting the crater theory,\r\nrunners, as we shall presently see, this view inapplicable to the\r\ngreater number of atolls.\r\n\r\n [1] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” volume iii., page 331.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo theory worthy of notice has been advanced to account for those\r\nbarrier-reefs, which encircle islands of moderate dimensions. The great\r\nreef which fronts the coast of Australia has been supposed, but without\r\nany special facts, to rest on the edge of a submarine precipice,\r\nextending parallel to the shore. The origin of the third class or of\r\nfringing-reefs presents, I believe, scarcely any difficulty, and is\r\nsimply consequent on the polypifers not growing up from great depths,\r\nand their not flourishing close to gently shelving beaches where the\r\nwater is often turbid.\r\n\r\nWhat cause, then, has given to atolls and barrier-reefs their\r\ncharacteristic forms? Let us see whether an important deduction will\r\nnot follow from the consideration of these two circumstances, first,\r\nthe reef-building corals flourishing only at limited depths; and\r\nsecondly, the vastness of the areas interspersed with coral-reefs and\r\ncoral-islets, none of which rise to a greater height above the level of\r\nthe sea, than that attained by matter thrown up by the waves and winds.\r\nI do not make this latter statement vaguely; I have carefully sought\r\nfor descriptions of every island in the intertropical seas; and my task\r\nhas been in some degree abridged by a map of the Pacific, corrected in\r\n1834 by MM. D’Urville and Lottin, in which the low islands are\r\ndistinguished from the high ones (even from those much less than a\r\nhundred feet in height) by being written without a capital letter; I\r\nhave detected a few errors in this map, respecting the height of some\r\nof the islands, which will be noticed in the Appendix, where I treat of\r\ncoral formations in geographical order. To the Appendix, also, I must\r\nrefer for a more particular account of the data on which the statements\r\non the next page are grounded. I have ascertained, and chiefly from the\r\nwritings of Cook, Kotzebue, Bellinghausen, Duperrey, Beechey, and\r\nLutké, regarding the Pacific; and from Moresby[2] with respect to the\r\nIndian Ocean, that in the following cases the term “low island”\r\nstrictly means land of the height commonly attained by matter thrown up\r\nby the winds and the waves of an open sea. If we draw a line (the plan\r\nI have always adopted) joining the external atolls of that part of the\r\nLow Archipelago in which the islands are numerous, the figure will be a\r\npointed ellipse (reaching from Hood to Lazaref Island), of which the\r\nlonger axis is 840 geographical miles, and the shorter 420 miles; in\r\nthis space[3] none of the innumerable islets united into great rings\r\nrise above the stated level. The Gilbert group is very narrow, and 300\r\nmiles in length. In a prolonged line from this group, at the distance\r\nof 240 miles, is the Marshall Archipelago, the figure of which is an\r\nirregular square, one end being broader than the other; its length is\r\n520 miles, with an average width of 240; these two groups together are\r\n1,040 miles in length, and all their islets are low. Between the\r\nsouthern end of the Gilbert and the northern end of Low Archipelago,\r\nthe ocean is thinly strewed with islands, all of which, as far as I\r\nhave been able to ascertain, are low; so that from nearly the southern\r\nend of the Low Archipelago, to the northern end of the Marshall\r\nArchipelago, there is a narrow band of ocean, more than 4,000 miles in\r\nlength, containing a great number of islands, all of which are low. In\r\nthe western part of the Caroline Archipelago, there is a space of 480\r\nmiles in length, and about 100 broad, thinly interspersed with low\r\nislands. Lastly, in the Indian Ocean, the archipelago of the Maldivas\r\nis 470 miles in length, and 60 in breadth; that of the Laccadives is\r\n150 by 100 miles; as there is a low island between these two groups,\r\nthey may be considered as one group of 1,000 miles in length. To this\r\nmay be added the Chagos group of low islands, situated 280 miles\r\ndistant, in a line prolonged from the southern extremity of the\r\nMaldivas. This group, including the submerged banks, is 170 miles in\r\nlength and 80 in breadth. So striking is the uniformity in direction of\r\nthese three archipelagoes, all the islands of which are low, that\r\nCaptain Moresby, in one of his papers, speaks of them as parts of one\r\ngreat chain, nearly 1,500 miles long. I am, then, fully justified in\r\nrepeating, that enormous spaces, both in the Pacific and Indian Oceans,\r\nare interspersed with islands, of which not one rises above that\r\nheight, to which the waves and winds in an open sea can heap up matter.\r\n\r\n [2] See also Captain Owen’s and Lieutenant Wood’s papers in the\r\n “Geographical Journal”, on the Maldiva and Laccadive Archipelagoes.\r\n These officers particularly refer to the lowness of the islets; but I\r\n chiefly ground my assertion respecting these two groups, and the\r\n Chagos group, from information communicated to me by Captain Moresby.\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] I find from Mr. Couthouy’s pamphlet (page 58) that Aurora Island\r\n is about two hundred feet in height; it consists of coral-rock, and\r\n seems to have been formed by the elevation of an atoll. It lies\r\n north-east of Tahiti, close without the line bounding the space\r\n coloured dark blue in the map appended to this volume. Honden Island,\r\n which is situated in the extreme north-west part of the Low\r\n Archipelago, according to measurements made on board the _Beagle_,\r\n whilst sailing by, is 114 feet from the _summit of the trees_ to the\r\n water’s edge. This island appeared to resemble the other atolls of the\r\n group.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn what foundations, then, have these reefs and islets of coral been\r\nconstructed? A foundation must originally have been present beneath\r\neach atoll at that limited depth, which is indispensable for the first\r\ngrowth of the reef-building polypifers. A conjecture will perhaps be\r\nhazarded, that the requisite bases might have been afforded by the\r\naccumulation of great banks of sediment, which owing to the action of\r\nsuperficial currents (aided possibly by the undulatory movement of the\r\nsea) did not quite reach the surface,—as actually appears to have been\r\nthe case in some parts of the West Indian Sea. But in the form and\r\ndisposition of the groups of atolls, there is nothing to countenance\r\nthis notion; and the assumption without any proof, that a number of\r\nimmense piles of sediment have been heaped on the floor of the great\r\nPacific and Indian Oceans, in their central parts far remote from land,\r\nand where the dark blue colour of the limpid water bespeaks its purity,\r\ncannot for one moment be admitted.\r\n\r\nThe many widely-scattered atolls must, therefore, rest on rocky bases.\r\nBut we cannot believe that the broad summit of a mountain lies buried\r\nat the depth of a few fathoms beneath every atoll, and nevertheless\r\nthroughout the immense areas above-named, with not one point of rock\r\nprojecting above the level of the sea; for we may judge with some\r\naccuracy of mountains beneath the sea, by those on the land; and where\r\ncan we find a single chain several hundred miles in length and of\r\nconsiderable breadth, much less several such chains, with their many\r\nbroad summits attaining the same height, within from 120 to 180 feet?\r\nIf the data be thought insufficient, on which I have grounded my\r\nbelief, respecting the depth at which the reef-building polypifers can\r\nexist, and it be assumed that they can flourish at a depth of even one\r\nhundred fathoms, yet the weight of the above argument is but little\r\ndiminished, for it is almost equally improbable, that as many submarine\r\nmountains, as there are low islands in the several great and widely\r\nseparated areas above specified, should all rise within six hundred\r\nfeet of the surface of the sea and not one above it, as that they\r\nshould be of the same height within the smaller limit of one or two\r\nhundred feet. So highly improbable is this supposition, that we are\r\ncompelled to believe, that the bases of the many atolls did never at\r\nany one period all lie submerged within the depth of a few fathoms\r\nbeneath the surface, but that they were brought into the requisite\r\nposition or level, some at one period and some at another, through\r\nmovements in the earth’s crust. But this could not have been effected\r\nby elevation, for the belief that points so numerous and so widely\r\nseparated were successively uplifted to a certain level, but that not\r\none point was raised above that level, is quite as improbable as the\r\nformer supposition, and indeed differs little from it. It will probably\r\noccur to those who have read Ehrenberg’s account of the Reefs of the\r\nRed Sea, that many points in these great areas may have been elevated,\r\nbut that as soon as raised, the protuberant parts were cut off by the\r\ndestroying action of the waves: a moment’s reflection, however, on the\r\nbasin-like form of the atolls, will show that this is impossible; for\r\nthe upheaval and subsequent abrasion of an island would leave a flat\r\ndisc, which might become coated with coral, but not a deeply concave\r\nsurface; moreover, we should expect to see, in some parts at least, the\r\nrock of the foundation brought to the surface. If, then, the\r\nfoundations of the many atolls were not uplifted into the requisite\r\nposition, they must of necessity have subsided into it; and this at\r\nonce solves every difficulty,[4] for we may safely infer, from the\r\nfacts given in the last chapter, that during a gradual subsidence the\r\ncorals would be favourably circumstanced for building up their solid\r\nframe works and reaching the surface, as island after island slowly\r\ndisappeared. Thus areas of immense extent in the central and most\r\nprofound parts of the great oceans, might become interspersed with\r\ncoral-islets, none of which would rise to a greater height than that\r\nattained by detritus heaped up by the sea, and nevertheless they might\r\nall have been formed by corals, which absolutely required for their\r\ngrowth a solid foundation within a few fathoms of the surface.\r\n\r\n [4] The additional difficulty on the crater hypothesis before alluded\r\n to, will now be evident; for on this view the volcanic action must be\r\n supposed to have formed within the areas specified a vast number of\r\n craters, all rising within a few fathoms of the surface, and not one\r\n above it. The supposition that the craters were at different times\r\n upraised above the surface, and were there abraded by the surf and\r\n subsequently coated by corals, is subject to nearly the same\r\n objections with those given above in this paragraph; but I consider it\r\n superfluous to detail all the arguments opposed to such a notion.\r\n Chamisso’s theory, from assuming the existence of so many banks, all\r\n lying at the proper depth beneath the water, is also vitally\r\n defective. The same observation applies to an hypothesis of Lieutenant\r\n Nelson’s (“Geolog. Trans.” volume v., page 122), who supposes that the\r\n ring-formed structure is caused by a greater number of germs of corals\r\n becoming attached to the declivity, than to the central plateau of a\r\n submarine bank: it likewise applies to the notion formerly entertained\r\n (Forster’s “Observ.” page 151), that lagoon-islands owe their peculiar\r\n form to the instinctive tendencies of the polypifers. According to\r\n this latter view, the corals on the outer margin of the reef\r\n instinctively expose themselves to the surf in order to afford\r\n protection to corals living in the lagoon, which belong to other\r\n genera, and to other families!\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be out of place here to do more than allude to the many facts,\r\nshowing that the supposition of a gradual subsidence over large areas\r\nis by no means improbable. We have the clearest proof that a movement\r\nof this kind is possible, in the upright trees buried under the strata\r\nmany thousand feet in thickness; we have also every reason for\r\nbelieving that there are now large areas gradually sinking, in the same\r\nmanner as others are rising. And when we consider how many parts of the\r\nsurface of the globe have been elevated within recent geological\r\nperiods, we must admit that there have been subsidences on a\r\ncorresponding scale, for otherwise the whole globe would have swollen.\r\nIt is very remarkable that Mr. Lyell,[5] even in the first edition of\r\nhis “Principles of Geology,” inferred that the amount of subsidence in\r\nthe Pacific must have exceeded that of elevation, from the area of land\r\nbeing very small relatively to the agents there tending to form it,\r\nnamely, the growth of coral and volcanic action. But it will be asked,\r\nare there any direct proofs of a subsiding movement in those areas, in\r\nwhich subsidence will explain a phenomenon otherwise inexplicable?\r\nThis, however, can hardly be expected, for it must ever be most\r\ndifficult, excepting in countries long civilised, to detect a movement,\r\nthe tendency of which is to conceal the part affected. In barbarous and\r\nsemi-civilised nations how long might not a slow movement, even of\r\nelevation such as that now affecting Scandinavia, have escaped\r\nattention!\r\n\r\n [5] “Principles of Geology,” sixth edition, volume iii., page 386.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Williams[6] insists strongly that the traditions of the natives,\r\nwhich he has taken much pains in collecting, do not indicate the\r\nappearance of any new islands: but on the theory of a gradual\r\nsubsidence, all that would be apparent would be, the water sometimes\r\nencroaching slowly on the land, and the land again recovering by the\r\naccumulation of detritus its former extent, and perhaps sometimes the\r\nconversion of an atoll with coral islets on it, into a bare or into a\r\nsunken annular reef. Such changes would naturally take place at the\r\nperiods when the sea rose above its usual limits, during a gale of more\r\nthan ordinary strength; and the effects of the two causes would be\r\nhardly distinguishable. In Kotzebue’s “Voyage” there are accounts of\r\nislands, both in the Caroline and Marshall Archipelagoes, which have\r\nbeen partly washed away during hurricanes; and Kadu, the native who was\r\non board one of the Russian vessels, said “he saw the sea at Radack\r\nrise to the feet of the cocoa-nut trees; but it was conjured in\r\ntime.”[7] A storm lately entirely swept away two of the Caroline\r\nislands, and converted them into shoals; it partly, also, destroyed two\r\nother islands.[8] According to a tradition which was communicated to\r\nCaptain Fitzroy, it is believed in the Low Archipelago, that the\r\narrival of the first ship caused a great inundation, which destroyed\r\nmany lives. Mr. Stutchbury relates, that in 1825, the western side of\r\nChain Atoll, in the same group, was completely devastated by a\r\nhurricane, and not less than 300 lives lost: “in this instance it was\r\nevident, even to the natives, that the hurricane alone was not\r\nsufficient to account for the violent agitation of the ocean.”[9] That\r\nconsiderable changes have taken place recently in some of the atolls in\r\nthe Low Archipelago, appears certain from the case already given of\r\nMatilda Island: with respect to Whitsunday and Gloucester Islands in\r\nthis same group, we must either attribute great inaccuracy to their\r\ndiscoverer, the famous circumnavigator Wallis, or believe that they\r\nhave undergone a considerable change in the period of fifty-nine years,\r\nbetween his voyage and that of Captain Beechey’s. Whitsunday Island is\r\ndescribed by Wallis as “about four miles long, and three wide,” now it\r\nis only one mile and a half long. The appearance of Gloucester Island,\r\nin Captain Beechey’s words,[10] “has been accurately described by its\r\ndiscoverer, but its present form and extent differ materially.”\r\nBlenheim reef, in the Chagos group, consists of a water-washed annular\r\nreef, thirteen miles in circumference, surrounding a lagoon ten fathoms\r\ndeep: on its surface there were a few worn patches of conglomerate\r\ncoral-rock, of about the size of hovels; and these Captain Moresby\r\nconsidered as being, without doubt, the last remnants of islets; so\r\nthat here an atoll has been converted into an atoll-formed reef. The\r\ninhabitants of the Maldiva Archipelago, as long ago as 1605, declared,\r\n“that the high tides and violent currents were diminishing the number\r\nof the islands:”[11] and I have already shown, on the authority of\r\nCaptain Moresby, that the work of destruction is still in progress; but\r\nthat on the other hand the first formation of some islets is known to\r\nthe present inhabitants. In such cases, it would be exceedingly\r\ndifficult to detect a gradual subsidence of the foundation, on which\r\nthese mutable structures rest.\r\n\r\n [6] Williams’s “Narrative of Missionary Enterprise,” page 31.\r\n\r\n\r\n [7] Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” volume iii., page 168.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] M.

One of the islands in this group was formerly covered by a\r\nbed of mould, which, after an earthquake, disappeared, and was believed\r\nby the residents to have been washed by the rain through the broken\r\nmasses of underlying rock; the island was thus rendered unproductive.\r\nChamisso[12] states, that earthquakes are felt in the Marshall atolls,\r\nwhich are far from any high land, and likewise in the islands of the\r\nCaroline Archipelago. On one of the latter, namely Oulleay atoll,\r\nAdmiral Lutké, as he had the kindness to inform me, observed several\r\nstraight fissures about a foot in width, running for some hundred yards\r\nobliquely across the whole width of the reef. Fissures indicate a\r\nstretching of the earth’s crust, and, therefore, probably changes in\r\nits level; but these coral-islands, which have been shaken and\r\nfissured, certainly have not been elevated, and, therefore, probably\r\nthey have subsided. In the chapter on Keeling atoll, I attempted to\r\nshow by direct evidence, that the island underwent a movement of\r\nsubsidence, during the earthquakes lately felt there.\r\n\r\n [12] See Chamisso, in Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” volume iii., pages\r\n 182 and 136.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts stand thus;—there are many large tracts of ocean, without any\r\nhigh land, interspersed with reefs and islets, formed by the growth of\r\nthose kinds of corals, which cannot live at great depths; and the\r\nexistence of these reefs and low islets, in such numbers and at such\r\ndistant points, is quite inexplicable, excepting on the theory, that\r\nthe bases on which the reefs first became attached, slowly and\r\nsuccessively sank beneath the level of the sea, whilst the corals\r\ncontinued to grow upwards. No positive facts are opposed to this view,\r\nand some general considerations render it probable. There is evidence\r\nof change in form, whether or not from subsidence, on some of these\r\ncoral-islands; and there is evidence of subterranean disturbances\r\nbeneath them. Will then the theory, to which we have thus been led,\r\nsolve the curious problem,—what has given to each class of reef its\r\npeculiar form?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAA—Outer edge of the reef at the level of the sea.\r\n\r\nBB—Shores of the island.\r\n\r\nA′A′—Outer edge of the reef, after its upward growth during a period of\r\nsubsidence.\r\n\r\nCC—The lagoon-channel between the reef and the shores of the now\r\nencircled land.\r\n\r\nB′B′—The shores of the encircled island.\r\n\r\nN.B.—In this, and the following woodcut, the subsidence of the land\r\ncould only be represented by an apparent rise in the level of the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA′A′—Outer edges of the barrier-reef at the level of the sea.

Let the unbroken lines\r\nand the oblique shading in the woodcut (No. 4) represent a vertical\r\nsection through such an island; and the horizontal shading will\r\nrepresent the section of the reef. Now, as the island sinks down,\r\neither a few feet at a time or quite insensibly, we may safely infer\r\nfrom what we know of the conditions favourable to the growth of coral,\r\nthat the living masses bathed by the surf on the margin of the reef,\r\nwill soon regain the surface. The water, however, will encroach, little\r\nby little, on the shore, the island becoming lower and smaller, and the\r\nspace between the edge of the reef and the beach proportionately\r\nbroader. A section of the reef and island in this state, after a\r\nsubsidence of several hundred feet, is given by the dotted lines:\r\ncoral-islets are supposed to have been formed on the new reef, and a\r\nship is anchored in the lagoon-channel. This section is in every\r\nrespect that of an encircling barrier-reef; it is, in fact, a section\r\ntaken[13] E. and W. through the highest point of the encircled island\r\nof Bolabola; of which a plan is given in Plate I., Figure 5. The same\r\nsection is more clearly shown in the following woodcut (No. 5) by the\r\nunbroken lines. The width of the reef, and its slope, both on the outer\r\nand inner side, will have been determined by the growing powers of the\r\ncoral, under the conditions (for instance the force of the breakers and\r\nof the currents) to which it has been exposed; and the lagoon-channel\r\nwill be deeper or shallower, in proportion to the growth of the\r\ndelicately branched corals within the reef, and to the accumulation of\r\nsediment, relatively, also, to the rate of subsidence and the length of\r\nthe intervening stationary periods.\r\n\r\n [13] The section has been made from the chart given in the “Atlas of\r\n the Voyage of the _Coquille_.” The scale is .57 of an inch to a mile.\r\n The height of the island, according to M. Lesson, is 4,026 feet. The\r\n deepest part of the lagoon-channel is 162 feet; its depth is\r\n exaggerated in the woodcut for the sake of clearness.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is evident in this section, that a line drawn perpendicularly down\r\nfrom the outer edge of the new reef to the foundation of solid rock,\r\nexceeds by as many feet as there have been feet of subsidence, that\r\nsmall limit of depth at which the effective polypifers can live—the\r\ncorals having grown up, as the whole sank down, from a basis formed of\r\nother corals and their consolidated fragments. Thus the difficulty on\r\nthis head, which before seemed so great, disappears.\r\n\r\nAs the space between the reef and the subsiding shore continued to\r\nincrease in breadth and depth, and as the injurious effects of the\r\nsediment and fresh water borne down from the land were consequently\r\nlessened, the greater number of the channels, with which the reef in\r\nits fringing state must have been breached, especially those which\r\nfronted the smaller streams, will have become choked up with the growth\r\nof coral: on the windward side of the reef, where the coral grows most\r\nvigorously, the breaches will probably have first been closed. In\r\nbarrier-reefs, therefore, the breaches kept open by draining the tidal\r\nwaters of the lagoon-channel, will generally be placed on the leeward\r\nside, and they will still face the mouths of the larger streams,\r\nalthough removed beyond the influence of their sediment and fresh\r\nwater;—and this, it has been shown, is commonly the case.\r\n\r\nReferring to the diagram shown above, in which the newly formed\r\nbarrier-reef is represented by unbroken lines, instead of by dots as in\r\nthe former woodcut, let the work of subsidence go on, and the doubly\r\npointed hill will form two small islands (or more, according to the\r\nnumber of the hills) included within one annular reef. Let the island\r\ncontinue subsiding, and the coral-reef will continue growing up on its\r\nown foundation, whilst the water gains inch by inch on the land, until\r\nthe last and highest pinnacle is covered, and there remains a perfect\r\natoll. A vertical section of this atoll is shown in the woodcut by the\r\ndotted lines;—a ship is anchored in its lagoon, but islets are not\r\nsupposed yet to have been formed on the reef. The depth of the lagoon\r\nand the width and slope of the reef, will depend on the circumstances\r\njust referred to under barrier-reefs. Any further subsidence will\r\nproduce no change in the atoll, except perhaps a diminution in its\r\nsize, from the reef not growing vertically upwards; but should the\r\ncurrents of the sea act violently upon it, and should the corals perish\r\non part or on the whole of its margin, changes would result during\r\nsubsidence which will be presently noticed. I may here observe, that a\r\nbank either of rock or of hardened sediment, level with the surface of\r\nthe sea, and fringed with living coral, would (if not so small as to\r\nallow the central space to be quickly filled up with detritus) by\r\nsubsidence be converted immediately into an atoll, without passing, as\r\nin the case of a reef fringing the shore of an island, through the\r\nintermediate form of a barrier-reef. If such a bank lay a few fathoms\r\nsubmerged, the simple growth of the coral (as remarked in the third\r\nchapter) without the aid of subsidence, would produce a structure\r\nscarcely to be distinguished from a true atoll; for in all cases the\r\ncorals on the outer margin of a reef, from having space and being\r\nfreely exposed to the open sea, will grow vigorously and tend to form a\r\ncontinuous ring whilst the growth of the less massive kinds on the\r\ncentral expanse, will be checked by the sediment formed there, and by\r\nthat washed inwards by the breakers; and as the space becomes\r\nshallower, their growth will, also, be checked by the impurities of the\r\nwater, and probably by the small amount of food brought by the\r\nenfeebled currents, in proportion to the surface of living reefs\r\nstudded with innumerable craving mouths: the subsidence of a reef based\r\non a bank of this kind, would give depth to its central expanse or\r\nlagoon, steepness to its flanks, and through the free growth of the\r\ncoral, symmetry to its outline:—I may here repeat that the larger\r\ngroups of atolls in the Pacific and Indian Oceans cannot be supposed to\r\nbe founded on banks of this nature.\r\n\r\nIf, instead of the island in the diagram, the shore of a continent\r\nfringed by a reef had subsided, a great barrier-reef, like that on the\r\nnorth-east coast of Australia, would have necessarily resulted; and it\r\nwould have been separated from the main land by a deep-water channel,\r\nbroad in proportion to the amount of subsidence, and to the less or\r\ngreater inclination of the neighbouring coast-line. The effect of the\r\ncontinued subsidence of a great barrier-reef of this kind, and its\r\nprobable conversion into a chain of separate atolls, will be noticed,\r\nwhen we discuss the apparent progressive disseverment of the larger\r\nMaldiva atolls.\r\n\r\nWe now are able to perceive that the close similarity in form,\r\ndimensions, structure, and relative position (which latter point will\r\nhereafter be more fully noticed) between fringing and encircling\r\nbarrier-reefs, and between these latter and atolls, is the necessary\r\nresult of the transformation, during subsidence of the one class into\r\nthe other. On this view, the three classes of reefs ought to graduate\r\ninto each other. Reefs having intermediate character between those of\r\nthe fringing and barrier classes do exist; for instance, on the\r\nsouth-west coast of Madagascar, a reef extends for several miles,\r\nwithin which there is a broad channel from seven to eight fathoms deep,\r\nbut the sea does not deepen abruptly outside the reef. Such cases,\r\nhowever, are open to some doubts, for an old fringing-reef, which had\r\nextended itself a little on a basis of its own formation, would hardly\r\nbe distinguishable from a barrier-reef, produced by a small amount of\r\nsubsidence, and with its lagoon-channel nearly filled up with sediment\r\nduring a long stationary period. Between barrier-reefs, encircling\r\neither one lofty island or several small low ones, and atolls including\r\na mere expanse of water, a striking series can be shown: in proof of\r\nthis, I need only refer to the first plate in this volume, which speaks\r\nmore plainly to the eye, than any description could to the ear. The\r\nauthorities from which the charts have been engraved, together with\r\nsome remarks on them and descriptive of the plates, are given above. At\r\nNew Caledonia (Plate II., Figure 5.) the barrier-reefs extend for 150\r\nmiles on each side of the submarine prolongation of the island; and at\r\ntheir northern extremity they appear broken up and converted into a\r\nvast atoll-formed reef, supporting a few low coral-islets: we may\r\nimagine that we here see the effects of subsidence actually in\r\nprogress, the water always encroaching on the northern end of the\r\nisland, towards which the mountains slope down, and the reefs steadily\r\nbuilding up their massive fabrics in the lines of their ancient growth.\r\n\r\nWe have as yet only considered the origin of barrier-reefs and atolls\r\nin their simplest form; but there remain some peculiarities in\r\nstructure and some special cases, described in the two first chapters,\r\nto be accounted for by our theory. These consist—in the inclined ledge\r\nterminated by a wall, and sometimes succeeded by a second ledge with a\r\nwall, round the shores of certain lagoons and lagoon-channels; a\r\nstructure which cannot, as I endeavoured to show, be explained by the\r\nsimple growing powers of the corals,—in the ring or basin-like forms of\r\nthe central reefs, as well as of the separate marginal portions of the\r\nnorthern Maldiva atolls,—in the submerged condition of the whole, or of\r\nparts of certain barrier and atoll-formed reefs; where only a part is\r\nsubmerged, this being generally to leeward,—in the apparent progressive\r\ndisseverment of some of the Maldiva atolls,—in the existence of\r\nirregularly formed atolls, some being tied together by linear reefs,\r\nand others with spurs projecting from them,—and, lastly, in the\r\nstructure and origin of the Great Chagos bank.\r\n\r\n_Step-formed ledges round certain lagoons_.—If we suppose an atoll to\r\nsubside at an extremely slow rate, it is difficult to follow out the\r\ncomplex results. The living corals would grow up on the outer margin;\r\nand likewise probably in the gullies and deeper parts of the bare\r\nsurface of the annular reef; the water would encroach on the islets,\r\nbut the accumulation of fresh detritus might possibly prevent their\r\nentire submergence. After a subsidence of this very slow nature, the\r\nsurface of the annular reef sloping gently into the lagoon, would\r\nprobably become united with the irregular reefs and banks of sand,\r\nwhich line the shores of most lagoons. Should, however, the atoll be\r\ncarried down by a more rapid movement, the whole surface of the annular\r\nreef, where there was a foundation of solid matter, would be favourably\r\ncircumstanced for the fresh growth of coral; but as the corals grew\r\nupwards on its exterior margin, and the waves broke heavily on this\r\npart, the increase of the massive polypifers on the inner side would be\r\nchecked from the want of water. Consequently, the exterior parts would\r\nfirst reach the surface, and the new annular reef thus formed on the\r\nold one, would have its summit inclined inwards, and be terminated by a\r\nsubaqueous wall, formed by the upward growth of the coral (before being\r\nmuch checked), from the inner edge of the solid parts of the old reef.\r\nThe inner portion of the new reef, from not having grown to the\r\nsurface, would be covered by the waters of the lagoon. Should a\r\nsubsidence of the same kind be repeated, the corals would again grow up\r\nin a wall, from all the solid parts of the resunken reef, and,\r\ntherefore, not from within the sandy shores of the lagoon; and the\r\ninner part of the new annular reef would, from being as before checked\r\nin its upward growth, be of less height than the exterior parts, and\r\ntherefore would not reach the surface of the lagoon. In this case the\r\nshores of the lagoon would be surrounded by two inclined ledges, one\r\nbeneath the other, and both abruptly terminated by subaqueous\r\ncliffs.[14]\r\n\r\n [14] According to Mr. Couthouy (page 26) the external reef round many\r\n atolls descends by a succession of ledges or terraces. He attempts, I\r\n doubt whether successfully, to explain this structure somewhat in the\r\n same manner as I have attempted, with respect to the internal ledges\r\n round the lagoons of some atolls. More facts are wanted regarding the\r\n nature both of the interior and exterior step-like ledges: are all the\r\n ledges, or only the upper ones, covered with living coral? If they are\r\n all covered, are the kinds different on the ledges according to the\r\n depth? Do the interior and exterior ledges occur together in the same\r\n atolls; if so, what is their total width, and is the intervening\r\n surface-reef narrow, etc.?\r\n\r\n\r\n_The ring or basin-formed reefs of the northern Maldiva atolls_.—I may\r\nfirst observe, that the reefs within the lagoons of atolls and within\r\nlagoon-channels, would, if favourably circumstanced, grow upwards\r\nduring subsidence in the same manner as the annular rim; and,\r\ntherefore, we might expect that such lagoon-reefs, when not surrounded\r\nand buried by an accumulation of sediment more rapid than the rate of\r\nsubsidence, would rise abruptly from a greater depth than that at which\r\nthe efficient polypifers can flourish: we see this well exemplified in\r\nthe small abruptly-sided reefs, with which the deep lagoons of the\r\nChagos and Southern Maldiva atolls are studded. With respect to the\r\nring or basin-formed reefs of the Northern Maldiva atolls, it is\r\nevident, from the perfectly continuous series which exists that the\r\nmarginal rings, although wider than the exterior or bounding reef of\r\nordinary atolls, are only modified portions of such a reef; it is also\r\nevident that the central rings, although wider than the knolls or reefs\r\nwhich commonly occur in lagoons, occupy their place. The ring-like\r\nstructure has been shown to be contingent on the breaches into the\r\nlagoon being broad and numerous, so that all the reefs which are bathed\r\nby the waters of the lagoon are placed under nearly the same conditions\r\nwith the outer coast of an atoll standing in the open sea. Hence the\r\nexterior and living margins of these reefs must have been favourably\r\ncircumstanced for growing outwards, and increasing beyond the usual\r\nbreadth; and they must likewise have been favourably circumstanced for\r\ngrowing vigorously upwards, during the subsiding movements, to which by\r\nour theory the whole archipelago has been subjected; and subsidence\r\nwith this upward growth of the margins would convert the central space\r\nof each little reef into a small lagoon. This, however, could only take\r\nplace with those reefs, which had increased to a breadth sufficient to\r\nprevent their central spaces from being almost immediately filled up\r\nwith the sand and detritus driven inwards from all sides: hence it is\r\nthat few reefs, which are less than half a mile in diameter, even in\r\nthe atolls where the basin-like structure is most strikingly exhibited,\r\ninclude lagoons. This remark, I may add, applies to all coral-reefs\r\nwherever found. The basin-formed reefs of the Maldiva Archipelago may,\r\nin fact, be briefly described, as small atolls formed during subsidence\r\nover the separate portions of large and broken atolls, in the same\r\nmanner as these latter were formed over the barrier-reefs, which\r\nencircled the islands of a large archipelago now wholly submerged.\r\n\r\n_Submerged and Dead Reefs_.—In the second section of the first chapter,\r\nI have shown that there are in the neighbourhood of atolls, some deeply\r\nsubmerged banks, with level surfaces; that there are others, less\r\ndeeply but yet wholly submerged, having all the characters of perfect\r\natolls, but consisting merely of dead coral-rock; that there are\r\nbarrier-reefs and atolls with merely a portion of their reef, generally\r\non the leeward side, submerged; and that such portions either retain\r\ntheir perfect outline, or they appear to be quite effaced, their former\r\nplace being marked only by a bank, conforming in outline with that part\r\nof the reef which remains perfect. These several cases are, I believe,\r\nintimately related together, and can be explained by the same means.\r\nThere, perhaps, exist some submerged reefs, covered with living coral\r\nand growing upwards, but to these I do not here refer.\r\n\r\nAs we see that in those parts of the ocean, where coral-reefs are most\r\nabundant, one island is fringed and another neighbouring one is not\r\nfringed; as we see in the same archipelago, that all the reefs are more\r\nperfect in one part of it than in another, for instance, in the\r\nsouthern half compared with the northern half of the Maldiva\r\nArchipelago, and likewise on the outer coasts compared with the inner\r\ncoasts of the atolls in this same group, which are placed in a double\r\nrow; as we know that the existence of the innumerable polypifers\r\nforming a reef, depends on their sustenance, and that they are preyed\r\non by other organic beings; and, lastly, as we know that some inorganic\r\ncauses are highly injurious to the growth of coral, it cannot be\r\nexpected that during the round of change to which earth, air, and water\r\nare exposed, the reef-building polypifers should keep alive for\r\nperpetuity in any one place; and still less can this be expected,\r\nduring the progressive subsidences, perhaps at some periods more rapid\r\nthan at others, to which by our theory these reefs and islands have\r\nbeen subjected and are liable. It is, then, not improbable that the\r\ncorals should sometimes perish either on the whole or on part of a\r\nreef; if on part, the dead portion, after a small amount of subsidence,\r\nwould still retain its proper outline and position beneath the water.\r\nAfter a more prolonged subsidence, it would probably form, owing to the\r\naccumulation of sediment, only the margin of a flat bank, marking the\r\nlimits of the former lagoon. Such dead portions of reef would generally\r\nlie on the leeward side,[15] for the impure water and fine sediment\r\nwould more easily flow out from the lagoon over this side of the reef,\r\nwhere the force of the breakers is less than to windward; and therefore\r\nthe corals would be less vigorous on this side, and be less able to\r\nresist any destroying agent. It is likewise owing to this same cause,\r\nthat reefs are more frequently breached to leeward by narrow channels,\r\nserving as by ship-channels, than to windward. If the corals perished\r\nentirely, or on the greater part of the circumference of an atoll, an\r\natoll-shaped bank of dead rock, more or less entirely submerged, would\r\nbe produced; and further subsidence, together with the accumulation of\r\nsediment, would often obliterate its atoll-like structure, and leave\r\nonly a bank with a level surface.\r\n\r\n [15] Mr. Lyell, in the first edition of his “Principles of Geology,”\r\n offered a somewhat different explanation of this structure. He\r\n supposes that there has been subsidence; but he was not aware that the\r\n submerged portions of reef were in most cases, if not in all, dead;\r\n and he attributes the difference in height in the two sides of most\r\n atolls, chiefly to the greater accumulation of detritus to windward\r\n than to leeward. But as matter is accumulated only on the backward\r\n part of the reef, the front part would remain of the same height on\r\n both sides. I may here observe that in most cases (for instance, at\r\n Peros Banhos, the Gambier group and the Great Chagos Bank), and I\r\n suspect in all cases, the dead and submerged portions do not blend or\r\n slope into the living and perfect parts, but are separated from them\r\n by an abrupt line. In some instances small patches of living reef rise\r\n to the surface from the middle of the submerged and dead parts.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Chagos group of atolls, within an area of 160 miles by 60, there\r\nare two atoll-formed banks of dead rock (besides another very imperfect\r\none), entirely submerged; a third, with merely two or three very small\r\npieces of living reef rising to the surface; and a fourth, namely,\r\nPeros Banhos (Plate I., Figure 9), with a portion nine miles in length\r\ndead and submerged. As by our theory this area has subsided, and as\r\nthere is nothing improbable in the death, either from changes in the\r\nstate of the surrounding sea or from the subsidence being great or\r\nsudden, of the corals on the whole, or on portions of some of the\r\natolls, the case of the Chagos group presents no difficulty. So far\r\nindeed are any of the above-mentioned cases of submerged reefs from\r\nbeing inexplicable, that their occurrence might have been anticipated\r\non our theory, and as fresh atolls are supposed to be in progressive\r\nformation by the subsidence of encircling barrier-reefs, a weighty\r\nobjection, namely that the number of atolls must be increasing\r\ninfinitely, might even have been raised, if proofs of the occasional\r\ndestruction and loss of atolls could not have been adduced.\r\n\r\n_The disseverment of the larger Maldiva atolls_.—The apparent\r\nprogressive disseverment in the Maldiva Archipelago of large atolls\r\ninto smaller ones, is, in many respects, an important consideration,\r\nand requires an explanation. The graduated series which marks, as I\r\nbelieve, this process, can be observed only in the northern half of the\r\ngroup, where the atolls have exceedingly imperfect margins, consisting\r\nof detached basin-formed reefs. The currents of the sea flow across\r\nthese atolls, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, with considerable\r\nforce, and drift the sediment from side to side during the monsoons,\r\ntransporting much of it seaward; yet the currents sweep with greater\r\nforce round their flanks. It is historically known that these atolls\r\nhave long existed in their present state; and we can believe, that even\r\nduring a very slow subsidence they might thus remain, the central\r\nexpanse being kept at nearly its original depth by the accumulation of\r\nsediment. But in the action of such nicely balanced forces during a\r\nprogressive subsidence (like that, to which by our theory this\r\narchipelago has been subjected), it would be strange if the currents of\r\nthe sea should never make a direct passage across some one of the\r\natolls, through the many wide breaches in their margins. If this were\r\nonce effected, a deep-water channel would soon be formed by the removal\r\nof the finer sediment, and the check to its further accumulation; and\r\nthe sides of the channel would be worn into a slope like that on the\r\nouter coasts, which are exposed to the same force of the currents. In\r\nfact, a channel precisely like that bifurcating one which divides\r\nMahlos Mahdoo (Plate II., Figure 4.), would almost necessarily be\r\nformed. The scattered reefs situated near the borders of the new\r\nocean-channel, from being favourably placed for the growth of coral,\r\nwould, by their extension, tend to produce fresh margins to the\r\ndissevered portions; such a tendency is very evident (as may be seen in\r\nthe large published chart) in the elongated reefs on the borders of the\r\ntwo channels intersecting Mahlos Mahdoo. Such channels would become\r\ndeeper with continued subsidence, and probably from the reefs not\r\ngrowing up perpendicularly, somewhat broader. In this case, and more\r\nespecially if the channels had been formed originally of considerable\r\nbreadth, the dissevered portions would become perfect and distinct\r\natolls, like Ari and Ross atolls (Plate II., Figure 6), or like the two\r\nNillandoo atolls, which must be considered as distinct, although\r\nrelated in form and position, and separated from each other by\r\nchannels, which though deep have been sounded. Further subsidence would\r\nrender such channels unfathomable, and the dissevered portions would\r\nthen resemble Phaleedoo and Moluque atolls, or Mahlos Mahdoo and\r\nHorsburgh atolls (Plate II., Figure 4), which are related to each other\r\nin no respect except in proximity and position. Hence, on the theory of\r\nsubsidence, the disseverment of large atolls, which have imperfect\r\nmargins (for otherwise their disseverment would be scarcely possible),\r\nand which are exposed to strong currents, is far from being an\r\nimprobable event; and the several stages, from close relation to entire\r\nisolation in the atolls of the Maldiva Archipelago, are readily\r\nexplicable.\r\n\r\nWe might go even further, and assert as not improbable, that the first\r\nformation of the Maldiva Archipelago was due to a barrier-reef, of\r\nnearly the same dimensions with that of New Caledonia (Plate II.,\r\nFigure 5), for if, in imagination, we complete the subsidence of that\r\ngreat island, we might anticipate from the present broken condition of\r\nthe northern portion of the reef, and from the almost entire absence of\r\nreefs on the eastern coast, that the barrier-reef after repeated\r\nsubsidences, would become during its upward growth separated into\r\ndistinct portions; and these portions would tend to assume an\r\natoll-like structure, from the coral growing with vigour round their\r\nentire circumferences, when freely exposed to an open sea. As we have\r\nsome large islands partly submerged with barrier-reefs marking their\r\nformer limits, such as New Caledonia, so our theory makes it probable\r\nthat there should be other large islands wholly submerged; and these,\r\nwe may now infer, would be surmounted, not by one enormous atoll, but\r\nby several large elongated ones, like the atolls in the Maldiva group;\r\nand these again, during long periods of subsidence, would sometimes\r\nbecome dissevered into smaller atolls. I may add, that both in the\r\nMarshall and Caroline Archipelagoes, there are atolls standing close\r\ntogether, which have an evident relationship in form: we may suppose,\r\nin such cases, either that two or more encircled islands originally\r\nstood close together, and afforded bases for two or more atolls, or\r\nthat one atoll has been dissevered. From the position, as well as form,\r\nof three atolls in the Caroline Archipelago (the Namourrek and Elato\r\ngroup), which are placed in an irregular circle, I am strongly tempted\r\nto believe that they have originated by the process of\r\ndisseverment.[16]\r\n\r\n [16] The same remark is, perhaps, applicable to the islands of Ollap,\r\n Fanadik, and Tamatam in the Caroline Archipelago, of which charts are\r\n given in the atlas of Duperrey’s voyage: a line drawn through the\r\n linear reefs and lagoons of these three islands forms a semicircle.\r\n Consult also, the atlas of Lutké’s voyage; and for the Marshall group\r\n that of Kotzebue; for the Gilbert group consult the atlas of\r\n Duperrey’s voyage. Most of the points here referred to may, however,\r\n be seen in Krusenstern’s general Atlas of the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irregularly formed Atolls_.—In the Marshall group, Musquillo atoll\r\nconsists of two loops united in one point; and Menchikoff atoll is\r\nformed of three loops, two of which (as may be seen in Figure 3, Plate\r\nII.) are connected by a mere ribbon-shaped reef, and the three together\r\nare sixty miles in length. In the Gilbert group some of the atolls have\r\nnarrow strips of reef, like spurs, projecting from them. There occur\r\nalso in parts of the open sea, a few linear and straight reefs,\r\nstanding by themselves; and likewise some few reefs in the form of\r\ncrescents, with their extremities more or less curled inwards. Now, the\r\nupward growth of a barrier-reef which fronted only one side of an\r\nisland, or one side of an elongated island with its extremities (of\r\nwhich cases exist), would produce after the complete subsidence of the\r\nland, mere strips or crescent or hook-formed reefs: if the island thus\r\npartially fronted became divided during subsidence into two or more\r\nislands, these islands would be united together by linear reefs; and\r\nfrom the further growth of the coral along their shores together with\r\nsubsidence, reefs of various forms might ultimately be produced, either\r\natolls united together by linear reefs, or atolls with spurs projecting\r\nfrom them. Some, however, of the more simple forms above specified,\r\nmight, as we have seen, be equally well produced by the coral perishing\r\nduring subsidence on part of the circumference of an atoll, whilst on\r\nthe other parts it continued to grow up till it reached the surface.\r\n\r\n_The Great Chagos Bank_.—I have already shown that the submerged\r\ncondition of the Great Chagos Bank (Plate II., Figure 1, with its\r\nsection Figure 2), and of some other banks in the Chagos group, may in\r\nall probability be attributed to the coral having perished before or\r\nduring the movements of subsidence, to which this whole area by our\r\ntheory has been subjected. The external rim or upper ledge (shaded in\r\nthe chart), consists of dead coral-rock thinly covered with sand; it\r\nlies at an average depth of between five and eight fathoms, and\r\nperfectly resembles in form the annular reef of an atoll. The banks of\r\nthe second level, the boundaries of which are marked by dotted lines in\r\nthe chart, lie from about fifteen to twenty fathoms beneath the\r\nsurface; they are several miles broad, and terminate in a very steep\r\nslope round the central expanse. This central expanse I have already\r\ndescribed, as consisting of a level muddy flat between thirty and forty\r\nfathoms deep. The banks of the second level, might at first sight be\r\nthought analogous to the internal step-like ledge of coral-rock which\r\nborders the lagoons of some atolls, but their much greater width, and\r\ntheir being formed of sand, are points of essential difference. On the\r\neastern side of the atoll some of the banks are linear and parallel,\r\nresembling islets in a great river, and pointed directly towards a\r\ngreat breach on the opposite side of the atoll; these are best seen in\r\nthe large published chart. I inferred from this circumstance, that\r\nstrong currents sometimes set directly across this vast bank; and I\r\nhave since heard from Captain Moresby that this is the case. I\r\nobserved, also, that the channels or breaches through the rim, were all\r\nof the same depth as the central lagoon-like space into which they\r\nlead; whereas the channels into the other atolls of the Chagos group,\r\nand as I believe into most other large atolls, are not nearly as deep\r\nas their lagoons: for instance at Peros Banhos, the channels are only\r\nof the same depth, namely between ten and twenty fathoms, as the bottom\r\nof the lagoon for a space about a mile and a half in width round its\r\nshores, whilst the central expanse of the lagoon is from thirty-five to\r\nforty fathoms deep. Now, if an atoll during a gradual subsidence once\r\nbecame entirely submerged, like the Great Chagos Bank, and therefore no\r\nlonger exposed to the surf, very little sediment could be formed from\r\nit; and consequently the channels leading into the lagoon from not\r\nbeing filled up with drifted sand and coral detritus, would continue\r\nincreasing in depth, as the whole sank down. In this case, we might\r\nexpect that the currents of the open sea, instead of any longer\r\nsweeping round the submarine flanks, would flow directly through the\r\nbreaches across the lagoon, removing in their course the finer\r\nsediment, and preventing its further accumulation. We should then have\r\nthe submerged reef forming an external and upper rim of rock, and\r\nbeneath this portion of the sandy bottom of the old lagoon, intersected\r\nby deep-water channels or breaches, and thus formed into separate\r\nmarginal banks; and these would be cut off by steep slopes, overhanging\r\nthe central space, worn down by the passage of the oceanic currents.\r\n\r\nBy these means, I have scarcely any doubt that the Great Chagos Bank\r\nhas originated,—a structure which at first appeared to me far more\r\nanomalous than any I had met with. The process of formation is nearly\r\nthe same with that, by which Mahlos Mahdoo had been trisected; but in\r\nthe Chagos Bank the channels of the oceanic currents entering at\r\nseveral different quarters, have united in a central space.\r\n\r\nThis great atoll-formed bank appears to be in an early stage of\r\ndisseverment; should the work of subsidence go on, from the submerged\r\nand dead condition of the whole reef, and the imperfection of the\r\nsouth-east quarter a mere wreck would probably be left. The Pitt’s\r\nBank, situated not far southward, appears to be precisely in this\r\nstate; it consists of a moderately level, oblong bank of sand, lying\r\nfrom 10 to 20 fathoms beneath the surface, with two sides protected by\r\na narrow ledge of rock which is submerged between 5 and 8 fathoms. A\r\nlittle further south, at about the same distance as the southern rim of\r\nthe Great Chagos Bank is from the northern rim, there are two other\r\nsmall banks with from 10 to 20 fathoms on them; and not far eastward\r\nsoundings were struck on a sandy bottom, with between 110 and 145\r\nfathoms. The northern portion with its ledge-like margin, closely\r\nresembles any one segment of the Great Chagos Bank, between two of the\r\ndeep-water channels, and the scattered banks, southward appear to be\r\nthe last wrecks of less perfect portions.\r\n\r\nI have examined with care the charts of the Indian and Pacific Oceans,\r\nand have now brought before the reader all the examples, which I have\r\nmet with, of reefs differing from the type of the class to which they\r\nbelong; and I think it has been satisfactorily shown, that they are all\r\nincluded in our theory, modified by occasional accidents which might\r\nhave been anticipated as probable. In this course we have seen, that in\r\nthe lapse of ages encircling barrier-reefs are occasionally converted\r\ninto atolls, the name of atoll being properly applicable, at the moment\r\nwhen the last pinnacle of encircled land sinks beneath the surface of\r\nthe sea. We have, also, seen that large atolls during the progressive\r\nsubsidence of the areas in which they stand, sometimes become\r\ndissevered into smaller ones; at other times, the reef-building\r\npolypifers having entirely perished, atolls are converted into\r\natoll-formed banks of dead rock; and these again through further\r\nsubsidence and the accumulation of sediment modified by the force of\r\nthe oceanic currents, pass into level banks with scarcely any\r\ndistinguishing character. Thus may the history of an atoll be followed\r\nfrom its first origin, through the occasional accidents of its\r\nexistence, to its destruction and final obliteration.\r\n\r\n_Objections to the theory of the formation of Atolls and\r\nBarrier-reefs_.—The vast amount of subsidence, both horizontally or in\r\narea, and vertically or in depth, necessary to have submerged every\r\nmountain, even the highest, throughout the immense spaces of ocean\r\ninterspersed with atolls, will probably strike most people as a\r\nformidable objection to my theory. But as continents, as large as the\r\nspaces supposed to have subsided, have been raised above the level of\r\nthe sea,—as whole regions are now rising, for instance, in Scandinavia\r\nand South America,—and as no reason can be assigned, why subsidences\r\nshould not have occurred in some parts of the earth’s crust on as great\r\na scale both in extent and amount as those of elevation, objections of\r\nthis nature strike me as of little force. The remarkable point is that\r\nmovements to such an extent should have taken place within a period,\r\nduring which the polypifers have continued adding matter on and above\r\nthe same reefs. Another and less obvious objection to the theory will\r\nperhaps be advanced from the circumstance, of the lagoons within atolls\r\nand within barrier-reefs never having become in any one instance during\r\nprolonged subsidences of a greater depth than sixty fathoms, and seldom\r\nmore than forty fathoms; but we already admit, if the theory be worth\r\nconsidering, that the rate of subsidence has not exceeded that of the\r\nupward growth of the coral on the exterior margin; we are, therefore,\r\nonly further required to admit, that the subsidence has not exceeded in\r\nrate the filling up of the interior spaces by the growth of the corals\r\nliving there, and by the accumulation of sediment. As this filling up\r\nmust take place very slowly within barrier-reefs lying far from the\r\nland, and within atolls which are of large dimensions and which have\r\nopen lagoons with very few reefs, we are led to conclude that the\r\nsubsidence thus counter-balanced, must have been slow in an\r\nextraordinary degree; a conclusion which accords with our only means,\r\nnamely, with what is known of the rate and manner of recent elevatory\r\nmovements, of judging by analogy what is the probable rate of\r\nsubsidence.\r\n\r\nIn this chapter it has, I think, been shown, that the theory of\r\nsubsidence, which we were compelled to receive from the necessity of\r\ngiving to the corals, in certain large areas, foundations at the\r\nrequisite depth, explains both the normal structure and the less\r\nregular forms of those two great classes of reefs, which have justly\r\nexcited the astonishment of all persons who have sailed through the\r\nPacific and Indian Oceans. But further to test the truth of the theory,\r\na crowd of questions will occur to the reader: Do the different kinds\r\nof reefs, which have been produced by the same kind of movement,\r\ngenerally lie within the same areas? What is their relation of form and\r\nposition,—for instance, do adjoining groups of atolls, and the separate\r\natolls in these groups, bear the same relation to each other which\r\nislands do in common archipelagoes? Have we reason to believe, that\r\nwhere there are fringing-reefs, there has not lately been subsidence;\r\nor, for it is almost our only way of ascertaining this point, are there\r\nfrequently proofs of recent elevation? Can we by this means account for\r\nthe presence of certain classes of reefs in some large areas, and their\r\nentire absence in others? Do the areas which have subsided, as\r\nindicated by the presence of atolls and barrier-reefs, and the areas\r\nwhich have remained stationary or have been upraised, as shown by\r\nfringing-reefs, bear any determinate relation to each other; and are\r\nthe dimensions of these areas such as harmonise with the greatness of\r\nthe subterranean changes, which, it must be supposed, have lately taken\r\nplace beneath them? Is there any connection between the movements thus\r\nindicated, and recent volcanic action? All these questions ought to\r\nreceive answers in accordance with the theory; and if this can be\r\nsatisfactorily shown, not only is the theory confirmed, but as\r\ndeductions, the answers are in themselves important. Under this latter\r\npoint of view, these questions will be chiefly considered in the\r\nfollowing chapter.[17]\r\n\r\n [17] I may take this opportunity of briefly considering the\r\n appearances, which would probably be presented by a vertical and deep\r\n section across a coral formation (referring chiefly to an atoll),\r\n formed by the upward growth of coral during successive subsidences.\r\n This is a subject worthy of attention, as a means of comparison with\r\n ancient coral-strata. The circumferential parts would consist of\r\n massive species, in a vertical position, with their interstices filled\r\n up with detritus; but this would be the part most subject to\r\n subsequent denudation and removal. It is useless to speculate how\r\n large a portion of the exterior annular reef would consist of upright\r\n coral, and how much of fragmentary rock, for this would depend on many\r\n contingencies,—such as on the rate of subsidence, occasionally\r\n allowing a fresh growth of coral to cover the whole surface, and on\r\n the breakers having force sufficient to throw fragments over this same\r\n space. The conglomerate which composes the base of the islets, would\r\n (if not removed by denudation together with the exterior reef on which\r\n it rests) be conspicuous from the size of the fragments,—the different\r\n degrees in which they have been rounded,—the presence of fragments of\r\n conglomerate torn up, rounded, and recemented,—and from the oblique\r\n stratification. The corals which lived in the lagoon-reefs at each\r\n successive level, would be preserved upright, and they would consist\r\n of many kinds, generally much branched. In this part, however, a very\r\n large proportion of the rock (and in some cases nearly all of it)\r\n would be formed of sedimentary matter, either in an excessively fine,\r\n or in a moderately coarse state, and with the particles almost blended\r\n together. The conglomerate which was formed of rounded pieces of the\r\n branched corals, on the shores of the lagoon, would differ from that\r\n formed on the islets and derived from the outer coast; yet both might\r\n have accumulated very near each other. I have seen a conglomerate\r\n limestone from Devonshire like a conglomerate now forming on the\r\n shores of the Maldiva atolls. The stratification taken as a whole,\r\n would be horizontal; but the conglomerate beds resting on the exterior\r\n reef, and the beds of sandstone on the shores of the lagoon (and no\r\n doubt on the external flanks) would probably be divided (as at Keeling\r\n atoll and at Mauritius) by numerous layers dipping at considerable\r\n angles in different directions. The calcareous sandstone and\r\n coral-rock would almost necessarily contain innumerable shells,\r\n echini, and the bones of fish, turtle, and perhaps of birds; possibly,\r\n also, the bones of small saurians, as these animals find their way to\r\n the islands far remote from any continent. The large shells of some\r\n species of Tridacna would be found vertically imbedded in the solid\r\n rock, in the position in which they lived. We might expect also to\r\n find a mixture of the remains of pelagic and littoral animals in the\r\n strata formed in the lagoon, for pumice and the seeds of plants are\r\n floated from distant countries into the lagoons of many atolls: on the\r\n outer coast of Keeling atoll, near the mouth of the lagoon, the case\r\n of a pelagic Pteropodous animal was brought up on the arming of the\r\n sounding lead. All the loose blocks of coral on Keeling atoll were\r\n burrowed by vermiform animals; and as every cavity, no doubt,\r\n ultimately becomes filled with spathose limestone, slabs of the rock\r\n taken from a considerable depth, would, if polished, probably exhibit\r\n the excavations of such burrowing animals. The conglomerate and\r\n fine-grained beds of coral-rock would be hard, sonorous, white and\r\n composed of nearly pure calcareous matter; in some few parts, judging\r\n from the specimens at Keeling atoll, they would probably contain a\r\n small quantity of iron. Floating pumice and scoriae, and occasionally\r\n stones transported in the root of trees (see my “Journal of\r\n Researches,” page 549) appear the only sources, through which foreign\r\n matter is brought to coral-formations standing in the open ocean. The\r\n area over which sediment is transported from coral-reefs must be\r\n considerable: Captain Moresby informs me that during the change of\r\n monsoons the sea is discoloured to a considerable distance off the\r\n Maldiva and Chagos atolls. The sediment of fringing and barrier\r\n coral-reefs must be mingled with the mud, which is brought down from\r\n the land, and is transported seaward through the breaches, which occur\r\n in front of almost every valley. If the atolls of the larger\r\n archipelagoes were upraised, the bed of the ocean being converted into\r\n land, they would form flat-topped mountains, varying in diameter from\r\n a few miles (the smallest atolls being worn away) to sixty miles; and\r\n from being horizontally stratified and of similar composition, they\r\n would, as Mr. Lyell has remarked, falsely appear as if they had\r\n originally been united into one vast continuous mass. Such great\r\n strata of coral-rock would rarely be associated with erupted volcanic\r\n matter, for this could only take place, as may be inferred from what\r\n follows in the next chapter, when the area, in which they were\r\n situated, commenced to rise, or at least ceased to subside. During the\r\n enormous period necessary to effect an elevation of the kind just\r\n alluded to, the surface would necessarily be denuded to a great\r\n thickness; hence it is highly improbable that any fringing-reef, or\r\n even any barrier-reef, at least of those encircling small islands,\r\n would be preserved. From this same cause, the strata which were formed\r\n within the lagoons of atolls and lagoon-channels of barrier-reefs, and\r\n which must consist in a large part of sedimentary matter, would more\r\n often be preserved to future ages, than the exterior solid reef,\r\n composed of massive corals in an upright position; although it is on\r\n this exterior part that the present existence and further growth of\r\n atolls and barrier-reefs entirely depend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nON THE DISTRIBUTION OF CORAL-REEFS WITH REFERENCE TO THE THEORY OF\r\nTHEIR FORMATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nDescription of the coloured map.—Proximity of atolls and\r\nbarrier-reefs.— Relation in form and position of atolls with ordinary\r\nislands.—Direct evidence of subsidence difficult to be detected.—Proofs\r\nof recent elevation where fringing-reefs occur.—Oscillations of\r\nlevel.—Absence of active volcanoes in the areas of\r\nsubsidence.—Immensity of the areas which have been elevated and have\r\nsubsided.—Their relation to the present distribution of the land.—Areas\r\nof subsidence elongated, their intersection and alternation with those\r\nof elevation.—Amount and slow rate of the subsidence.—Recapitulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to give here a short account of the appended map\r\n(Plate III.) [Inasmuch as the coloured map would have proved too costly\r\nto be given in this series, the indications of colour have been\r\nreplaced by numbers referring to the dotted groups of reefs, etc. The\r\nauthor’s original wording, however, is retained in full, as it will be\r\neasy to refer to the map by the numbers, and thus the flow of the\r\nnarrative is undisturbed.]: a fuller one, with the data for colouring\r\neach spot, is reserved for the Appendix; and every place there referred\r\nto may be found in the Index. A larger chart would have been desirable;\r\nbut, small as the adjoined one is, it is the result of many months’\r\nlabour. I have consulted, as far as I was able, every original voyage\r\nand map; and the colours were first laid down on charts on a larger\r\nscale. The same blue colour, with merely a difference in the depth of\r\ntint, is used for atolls or lagoon-islands, and barrier-reefs, for we\r\nhave seen, that as far as the actual coral-formation is concerned, they\r\nhave no distinguishing character. Fringing-reefs have been coloured\r\nred, for between them on the one hand, and barrier-reefs and atolls on\r\nthe other, there is an important distinction with respect to the depth\r\nbeneath the surface, at which we are compelled to believe their\r\nfoundations lie. The two distinct colours, therefore, mark two great\r\ntypes of structure.\r\n\r\nThe _dark blue colour_ [represented by (3) in our plate] represents\r\natolls and submerged annular reefs, with deep water in their centres. I\r\nhave coloured as atolls, a few low and small coral-islands, without\r\nlagoons; but this has been done only when it clearly appeared that they\r\noriginally contained lagoons, since filled up with sediment: when there\r\nwere not good grounds for this belief, they have been left uncoloured.\r\n\r\nThe _pale blue colour_ [represented by (2)] represents barrier-reefs.\r\nThe most obvious character of reefs of this class is the broad and\r\ndeep-water moat within the reef: but this, like the lagoons of small\r\natolls, is liable to become filled up with detritus and with reefs of\r\ndelicately branched corals: when, therefore, a reef round the entire\r\ncircumference of an island extends very far into a profoundly deep sea,\r\nso that it can hardly be confounded with a fringing-reef which must\r\nrest on a foundation of rock within a small depth, it has been coloured\r\npale blue, although it does not include a deep-water moat: but this has\r\nonly been done rarely, and each case is distinctly mentioned in the\r\nAppendix.\r\n\r\nThe _red colour_ (4) represents reefs fringing the land quite closely\r\nwhere the sea is deep, and where the bottom is gently inclined\r\nextending to a moderate distance from it, but not having a deep-water\r\nmoat or lagoon-like space parallel to the shore. It must be remembered\r\nthat fringing-reefs are frequently _breached_ in front of rivers and\r\nvalleys by deepish channels, where mud has been deposited. A space of\r\nthirty miles in width has been coloured round or in front of the reefs\r\nof each class, in order that the colours might be conspicuous on the\r\nappended map, which is reduced to so small a scale.\r\n\r\nThe _vermillion spots_, and streaks (1) represent volcanoes now in\r\naction, or historically known to have been so. They are chiefly laid\r\ndown from Von Buch’s work on the Canary Islands; and my reasons for\r\nmaking a few alterations are given in the note below.[1]\r\n\r\n [1] I have also made considerable use of the geological part of\r\n Berghaus’ “Physical Atlas.” Beginning at the eastern side of the\r\n Pacific, I have added to the number of the volcanoes in the southern\r\n part of the Cordillera, and have coloured Juan Fernandez according to\r\n observations collected during the voyage of the _Beagle_ (“Geological\r\n Transactions,” volume v., page 601.) I have added a volcano to\r\n Albemarle Island, one of the Galapagos Archipelago (the author’s\r\n “Journal of Researches,” page 457). In the Sandwich group there are no\r\n active volcanoes, except at Hawaii; but the Rev. W. Ellis informs me,\r\n there are streams of lava apparently modern on Maui, having a very\r\n recent appearance, which can be traced to the craters whence they\r\n flowed. The same gentleman informs me, that there is no reason to\r\n believe that any active volcano exists in the Society Archipelago; nor\r\n are there any known in the Samoa or Navigator group, although some of\r\n the streams of lava and craters there appear recent. In the Friendly\r\n group, the Rev. J. Williams says (“Narrative of Missionary\r\n Enterprise,” page 29) that Toofoa and Proby Islands are active\r\n volcanoes. I infer from Hamilton’s “Voyage in the ‘Pandora’” (Page\r\n 95), that Proby Island is synonymous with Onouafou, but I have not\r\n ventured to colour it. There can be no doubt respecting Toofoa, and\r\n Captain Edwards (Von Buch, page 386) found the lava of recent eruption\r\n at Amargura still smoking. Berghaus marks four active volcanoes\r\n actually within the Friendly group; but I do not know on what\r\n authority: I may mention that Maurelle describes Latte as having a\r\n burnt-up appearance: I have marked only Toofoa and Amargura. South of\r\n the New Hebrides lies Matthews Rock, which is drawn and described as\r\n an active crater in the “Voyage of the _Astrolabe_.” Between it and\r\n the volcano on the eastern side of New Zealand, lies Brimstone Island,\r\n which from the high temperature of the water in the crater, may be\r\n ranked as active (Berghaus “Vorbemerk,” II Lief. S. 56). Malte Brun,\r\n volume xii., page 231, says that there is a volcano near port St.\r\n Vincent in New Caledonia. I believe this to be an error, arising from\r\n a smoke seen on the _opposite_ coast by Cook (“Second Voyage,” volume\r\n ii., page 23) which smoke went out at night. The Mariana Islands,\r\n especially the northern ones, contain many craters (see Freycinet’s\r\n “Hydrog. Descript.”) which are not active. Von Buch, however, states\r\n (page 462) on the authority of La Peyrouse, that there are no less\r\n than seven volcanoes between these islands and Japan. Gemelli Creri\r\n (Churchill’s “Collect.” volume iv., page 458), says there are two\r\n active volcanoes in latitude 23° 30′, and in latitude 24°: but I have\r\n not coloured them. From the statements in Beechey’s “Voyage” (page\r\n 518, 4to edition) I have coloured one in the northern part of the\r\n Bonin group. M. S. Julien has clearly made out from Chinese\r\n manuscripts not very ancient (“Comptes Rendus,” 1840, page 832), that\r\n there are two active volcanoes on the eastern side of Formosa. In\r\n Torres Straits, on Cap Island (9° 48′ S., 142° 39′ E.) a volcano was\r\n seen burning with great violence in 1793 by Captain Bampton (see\r\n Introduction to Flinders’ “Voyage,” page 41). Mr. M’Clelland (Report\r\n of Committee for investigating Coal in India, page 39) has shown that\r\n the volcanic band passing through Barren Island must be extended\r\n northwards. It appears by an old chart, that Cheduba was once an\r\n active volcano (see also “Silliman’s North American Journal”, volume\r\n xxxviii., page 385). In Berghaus’ “Physical Atlas,” 1840, No. 7 of\r\n Geological Part, a volcano on the coast of Pondicherry is said to have\r\n burst forth in 1757. Ordinaire (“Hist. Nat. des Volcans,” page 218)\r\n says that there is one at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, but I have\r\n not coloured it, as he gives no particulars. A volcano in Amsterdam,\r\n or St. Paul’s, in the southern part of the Indian Ocean, has been seen\r\n (“Naut. Mag.” 1838, page 842) in action. Dr. J. Allan, of Forres,\r\n informs me in a letter, that when he was at Joanna, he saw at night\r\n flames apparently volcanic, issuing from the chief Comoro Island, and\r\n that the Arabs assured him that they were volcanic, adding that the\r\n volcano burned more during the wet season. I have marked this as a\r\n volcano, though with some hesitation, on account of the possibility of\r\n the flame arising from gaseous sources.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _uncoloured coasts_ consist, first and chiefly, of those, where\r\nthere are no coral-reefs, or such small portions as to be quite\r\ninsignificant. Secondly, of those coasts where there are reefs, but\r\nwhere the sea is very shallow, for in this case the reefs generally lie\r\nfar from the land, and become very irregular, in their forms: where\r\nthey have not become irregular, they have been coloured. thirdly, if I\r\nhad the means of ascertaining the fact, I should not colour a reef\r\nmerely coating the edges of a submarine crater, or of a level submerged\r\nbank; for such superficial formations differ essentially, even when not\r\nin external appearance, from reefs whose foundations as well as\r\nsuperficies have been wholly formed by the growth of coral. Fourthly,\r\nin the Red Sea, and within some parts of the East Indian Archipelago\r\n(if the imperfect charts of the latter can be trusted), there are many\r\nscattered reefs, of small size, represented in the chart by mere dots,\r\nwhich rise out of deep water: these cannot be arranged under either of\r\nthe three classes: in the Red Sea, however, some of these little reefs,\r\nfrom their position, seem once to have formed parts of a continuous\r\nbarrier. There exist, also, scattered in the open ocean, some linear\r\nand irregularly formed strips of coral-reef, which, as shown in the\r\nlast chapter, are probably allied in their origin to atolls; but as\r\nthey do not belong to that class, they have not been coloured; they are\r\nvery few in number and of insignificant dimensions. Lastly, some reefs\r\nare left uncoloured from the want of information respecting them, and\r\nsome because they are of an intermediate structure between the barrier\r\nand fringing classes. The value of the map is lessened, in proportion\r\nto the number of reefs which I have been obliged to leave uncoloured,\r\nalthough, in a theoretical point of view, few of them present any great\r\ndifficulty: but their number is not very great, as will be found by\r\ncomparing the map with the statements in the Appendix. I have\r\nexperienced more difficulty in colouring fringing-reefs than in\r\ncolouring barrier-reefs, as the former, from their much less\r\ndimensions, have less attracted the attention of navigators. As I have\r\nhad to seek my information from all kinds of sources, and often from\r\nindirect ones, I do not venture to hope that the map is free from many\r\nerrors. Nevertheless, I trust it will give an approximately correct\r\nview of the general distribution of the coral-reefs over the whole\r\nworld (with the exception of some fringing-reefs on the coast of\r\nBrazil, not included within the limits of the map), and of their\r\narrangement into the three great classes, which, though necessarily\r\nvery imperfect from the nature of the objects classified, have been\r\nadopted by most voyagers. I may further remark, that the dark blue\r\ncolour represents land entirely composed of coral-rock; the pale blue,\r\nland with a wide and thick border of coral-rock; and the red, a mere\r\nnarrow fringe of coral-rock.\r\n\r\nLooking now at the map under the theoretical point of view indicated in\r\nthe last chapter, the two blue tints signify that the foundations of\r\nthe reefs thus coloured have subsided to a considerable amount, at a\r\nslower rate than that of the upward growth of the corals, and that\r\nprobably in many cases they are still subsiding. The red signifies that\r\nthe shores which support fringing-reefs have not subsided (at least to\r\nany considerable amount, for the effects of a subsidence on a small\r\nscale would in no case be distinguishable); but that they have remained\r\nnearly stationary since the period when they first became fringed by\r\nreefs; or that they are now rising or have been upraised, with new\r\nlines of reefs successively formed on them: these latter alternatives\r\nare obviously implied, as newly formed lines of shore, after elevations\r\nof the land, would be in the same state with respect to the growth of\r\nfringing-reefs, as stationary coasts. If during the prolonged\r\nsubsidence of a shore, coral-reefs grew for the first time on it, or if\r\nan old barrier-reef were destroyed and submerged, and new reefs became\r\nattached to the land, these would necessarily at first belong to the\r\nfringing class, and, therefore, be coloured red, although the coast was\r\nsinking: but I have no reason to believe, that from this source of\r\nerror, any coast has been coloured wrongly with respect to movement\r\nindicated. Well characterised atolls and encircling barrier-reefs,\r\nwhere several occur in a group, or a single barrier-reef if of large\r\ndimensions, leave scarcely any doubt on the mind respecting the\r\nmovement by which they have been produced; and even a small amount of\r\nsubsequent elevation is soon betrayed. The evidence from a single atoll\r\nor a single encircling barrier-reef, must be received with some\r\ncaution, for the former may possibly be based upon a submerged crater\r\nor bank, and the latter on a submerged margin of sediment, or of\r\nworn-down rock. From these remarks we may with greater certainty infer\r\nthat the spaces, especially the larger ones, tinted blue in the map,\r\nhave subsided, than that the red spaces have remained stationary, or\r\nhave been upraised.\r\n\r\n_On the grouping of the different classes of reefs_.—Having made these\r\npreliminary remarks, I will consider first how far the grouping of the\r\ndifferent kinds of coral-islands and reefs is corroborative of the\r\ntruth of the theory. A glance at the map shows that the reefs, coloured\r\nblue and red, produced under widely different conditions, are not\r\nindiscriminately mixed together. Atolls and barrier-reefs, on the other\r\nhand, as may be seen by the two blue tints, generally lie near each\r\nother; and this would be the natural result of both having been\r\nproduced during the subsidence of the areas in which they stand. Thus,\r\nthe largest group of encircled islands is that of the Society\r\nArchipelago; and these islands are surrounded by atolls, and only\r\nseparated by a narrow space from the large group of Low atolls. In the\r\nmidst of the Caroline atolls, there are three fine encircled islands.\r\nThe northern point of the barrier-reef of New Caledonia seems itself,\r\nas before remarked, to form a complete large atoll. The great\r\nAustralian barrier is described as including both atolls and small\r\nencircled islands. Captain King[2] mentions many atoll-formed and\r\nencircling coral-reefs, some of which lie within the barrier, and\r\nothers may be said (for instance between latitude 16° and 13°) to form\r\npart of it. Flinders[3] has described an atoll-formed reef in latitude\r\n10°, seven miles long and from one to three broad, resembling a boot in\r\nshape, with apparently very deep water within. Eight miles westward of\r\nthis, and forming part of the barrier, lie the Murray Islands, which\r\nare high and are encircled. In the Corallian Sea, between the two great\r\nbarriers of Australia and New Caledonia, there are many low islets and\r\ncoral-reefs, some of which are annular, or horse-shoe shaped. Observing\r\nthe smallness of the scale of the map, the parallels of latitude being\r\nnine hundred miles apart, we see that none of the large groups of reefs\r\nand islands supposed to have been produced by long-continued\r\nsubsidence, lie near extensive lines of coast coloured red, which are\r\nsupposed to have remained stationary since the growth of their reefs,\r\nor to have been upraised and new lines of reefs formed on them. Where\r\nthe red and blue circles do occur near each other, I am able, in\r\nseveral instances, to show that there have been oscillations of level,\r\nsubsidence having preceded the elevation of the red spots; and\r\nelevation having preceded the subsidence of the blue spots: and in this\r\ncase the juxtaposition of reefs belonging to the two great types of\r\nstructure is little surprising. We may, therefore, conclude that the\r\nproximity in the same areas of the two classes of reefs, which owe\r\ntheir origin to the subsidence of the earth’s crust, and their\r\nseparation from those formed during its stationary or uprising\r\ncondition, holds good to the full extent, which might have been\r\nanticipated by our theory.\r\n\r\n [2] Sailing directions, appended to volume ii. of his “Surveying\r\n Voyage to Australia.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [3] “Voyage to Terra Australis,” volume ii. page 336.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs groups of atolls have originated in the upward growth, at each fresh\r\nsinking of the land, of those reefs which primarily fringed the shores\r\nof one great island, or of several smaller ones; so we might expect\r\nthat these rings of coral-rock, like so many rude outline charts, will\r\nstill retain some traces of the general form, or at least general\r\nrange, of the land, round which they were first modelled. That this is\r\nthe case with the atolls in the Southern Pacific as far as their range\r\nis concerned, seems highly probable, when we observe that the three\r\nprincipal groups are directed in north-west and south-east lines, and\r\nthat nearly all the land in the S. Pacific ranges in this same\r\ndirection; namely, N. Western Australia, New Caledonia, the northern\r\nhalf of New Zealand, the New Hebrides, Saloman, Navigator, Society,\r\nMarquesas, and Austral archipelagoes: in the Northern Pacific, the\r\nCaroline atolls abut against the north-west line of the Marshall\r\natolls, much in the same manner as the east and west line of islands\r\nfrom Ceram to New Britain do on New Ireland: in the Indian Ocean the\r\nLaccadive and Maldiva atolls extend nearly parallel to the western and\r\nmountainous coast of India. In most respects, there is a perfect\r\nresemblance with ordinary islands in the grouping of atolls and in\r\ntheir form: thus the outline of all the larger groups is elongated; and\r\nthe greater number of the individual atolls are elongated in the same\r\ndirection with the group, in which they stand. The Chagos group is less\r\nelongated than is usual with other groups, and the individual atolls in\r\nit are likewise but little elongated; this is strikingly seen by\r\ncomparing them with the neighbouring Maldiva atolls. In the Marshall\r\nand Maldiva archipelagoes, the atolls are ranged in two parallel lines,\r\nlike the mountains in a great double mountain-chain. Some of the\r\natolls, in the larger archipelagoes, stand so near to each other, and\r\nhave such an evident relationship in form, that they compose little\r\nsub-groups: in the Caroline Archipelago, one such sub-group consists of\r\nPouynipète, a lofty island encircled by a barrier-reef, and separated\r\nby a channel only four miles and a half wide from Andeema atoll, with a\r\nsecond atoll a little further off. In all these respects an examination\r\nof a series of charts will show how perfectly groups of atolls resemble\r\ngroups of common islands.\r\n\r\n_On the direct evidence of the blue spaces in the map having subsided\r\nduring the upward growth of the reefs so coloured, and of the red\r\nspaces having remained stationary, or having been upraised._—With\r\nrespect to subsidence, I have shown in the last chapter, that we cannot\r\nexpect to obtain in countries inhabited only by semi-civilised races,\r\ndemonstrative proofs of a movement, which invariably tends to conceal\r\nits own evidence. But on the coral-islands supposed to have been\r\nproduced by subsidence, we have proofs of changes in their external\r\nappearance—of a round of decay and renovation—of the last vestiges of\r\nland on some—of its first commencement on others: we hear of storms\r\ndesolating them to the astonishment of their inhabitants: we know by\r\nthe great fissures with which some of them are traversed, and by the\r\nearthquakes felt under others, that subterranean disturbances of some\r\nkind are in progress. These facts, if not directly connected with\r\nsubsidence, as I believe they are, at least show how difficult it would\r\nbe to discover proofs of such movement by ordinary means. At Keeling\r\natoll, however, I have described some appearances, which seem directly\r\nto show that subsidence did take place there during the late\r\nearthquakes. Vanikoro, according to Chevalier Dillon,[4] is often\r\nviolently shaken by earthquakes, and there, the unusual depth of the\r\nchannel between the shore and the reef,—the almost entire absence of\r\nislets on the reef,— its wall-like structure on the inner side, and the\r\nsmall quantity of low alluvial land at the foot of the mountains, all\r\nseem to show that this island has not remained long at its present\r\nlevel, with the lagoon-channel subjected to the accumulation of\r\nsediment, and the reef to the wear and tear of the breakers. At the\r\nSociety Archipelago, on the other hand, where a slight tremor is only\r\nrarely felt, the shoaliness of the lagoon-channels round some of the\r\nislands, the number of islets formed on the reefs of others, and the\r\nbroad belt of low land at the foot of the mountains, indicate that,\r\nalthough there must have been great subsidence to have produced the\r\nbarrier-reefs, there has since elapsed a long stationary period.[5]\r\n\r\n [4] See Captain Dillon’s “Voyage in search of La Peyrouse.” M. Cordier\r\n in his “Report on the Voyage of the ‘Astrolabe’” (page cxi., volume\r\n i.), speaking of Vanikoro, says the shores are surrounded by reefs of\r\n madrepore, _“qu’on assure être de formation tout-a-fait moderne_.” I\r\n have in vain endeavoured to learn some further particulars about this\r\n remarkable passage. I may here add, that according to our theory, the\r\n island of Pouynipète (Plate I., Figure 7), in the Caroline\r\n Archipelago, being encircled by a barrier-reef, must have subsided. In\r\n the “New S. Wales Lit. Advert.” February 1835 (which I have seen\r\n through the favour of Dr. Lloghtsky), there is an account of this\r\n island (subsequently confirmed by Mr. Campbell), in which it is said,\r\n “At the N.E. end, at a place called Tamen, there are ruins of a town,\r\n _now only_ accessible by boats, the waves _reaching to the steps of\r\n the houses_.” Judging from this passage, one would be tempted to\r\n conclude that the island must have subsided, since these houses were\r\n built. I may, also, here append a statement in Malte Brun (volume ix.,\r\n page 775, given without any authority), that the sea gains in an\r\n extraordinary manner on the coast of Cochin China, which lies in front\r\n and near the subsiding coral-reefs in the China Sea: as the coast is\r\n granitic, and not alluvial, it is scarcely possible that the\r\n encroachment of the sea can be owing to the washing away of the land;\r\n and if so, it must be due to subsidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] Mr. Couthouy states (“Remarks,” page 44) that at Tahiti and Eimeo\r\n the space between the reef and the shore has been nearly filled up by\r\n the extension of those coral-reefs, which within most barrier-reefs\r\n merely fringe the land. From this circumstance, he arrives at the same\r\n conclusion as I have done, that the Society Islands since their\r\n subsidence, have remained stationary during a long period; but he\r\n further believes that they have recently commenced rising, as well as\r\n the whole area of the Low Archipelago. He does not give any detailed\r\n proofs regarding the elevation of the Society Islands, but I shall\r\n refer to this subject in another part of this chapter. Before making\r\n some further comments, I may observe how satisfactory it is to me, to\r\n find Mr. Couthouy affirming, that “having personally examined a large\r\n number of coral-islands, and also residing eight months among the\r\n volcanic class, having shore and partially encircling reefs, I may be\r\n permitted to state that my own observations have impressed a\r\n conviction of the correctness of the theory of Mr. Darwin.”\r\n\r\n    This gentleman believes, that subsequently to the subsidence by\r\n    which the atolls in the Low Archipelago were produced, the whole\r\n    area has been elevated to the amount of a few feet; this would\r\n    indeed be a remarkable fact; but as far as I am able to judge, the\r\n    grounds of his conclusion are not sufficiently strong. He states\r\n    that he found in almost every atoll which he visited, the shores of\r\n    the lagoon raised from eighteen to thirty inches above the\r\n    sea-level, and containing imbedded Tridacnae and corals standing as\r\n    they grew; some of the corals were dead in their upper parts, but\r\n    below a certain line they continued to flourish. In the lagoons,\r\n    also, he frequently met with clusters of Madrepore, with their\r\n    extremities standing from one inch to a foot above the surface of\r\n    the water. Now, these appearances are exactly what I should have\r\n    expected, without any subsequent elevation having taken place; and\r\n    I think Mr. Couthouy has not borne in mind the indisputable fact,\r\n    that corals, when constantly bathed by the surf, can exist at a\r\n    higher level than in quite tranquil water, as in a lagoon. As long,\r\n    therefore, as the waves continued at low water to break entirely\r\n    over parts of the annular reef of an atoll, submerged to a small\r\n    depth, the corals and shells attached on these parts might continue\r\n    living at a level above the smooth surface of the lagoon, into\r\n    which the waves rolled; but as soon as the outer edge of the reef\r\n    grew up to its utmost possible height, or if the reef were very\r\n    broad nearly to that height, the force of the breakers would be\r\n    checked, and the corals and shells on the inner parts near the\r\n    lagoon would occasionally be left dry, and thus be partially or\r\n    wholly destroyed. Even in atolls, which have not lately subsided,\r\n    if the outer margin of the reef continued to increase in breadth\r\n    seaward (each fresh zone of corals rising to the same vertical\r\n    height as at Keeling atoll), the line where the waves broke most\r\n    heavily would advance outwards, and therefore the corals, which\r\n    when living near the margin, were washed by the breaking waves\r\n    during the whole of each tide, would cease being so, and would\r\n    therefore be left on the backward part of the reef standing exposed\r\n    and dead. The case of the madrepores in the lagoons with the tops\r\n    of their branches exposed, seems to be an analogous fact, to the\r\n    great fields of dead but upright corals in the lagoon of Keeling\r\n    atoll; a condition of things which I have endeavoured to show, has\r\n    resulted from the lagoon having become more and more enclosed and\r\n    choked up with reefs, so that during high winds, the rising of the\r\n    tide (as observed by the inhabitants) is checked, and the corals,\r\n    which had formerly grown to the greatest possible height, are\r\n    occasionally exposed, and thus are killed: and this is a condition\r\n    of things, towards which almost every atoll in the intervals of its\r\n    subsidence must be tending. Or if we look to the state of an atoll\r\n    directly after a subsidence of some fathoms, the waves would roll\r\n    heavily over the entire circumference of the reef, and the surface\r\n    of the lagoon would, like the ocean, never be quite at rest, and\r\n    therefore the corals in the lagoon, from being constantly laved by\r\n    the rippling water, might extend their branches to a little greater\r\n    height than they could, when the lagoon became enclosed and\r\n    protected. Christmas atoll (2° N. latitude) which has a very\r\n    shallow lagoon, and differs in several respects from most atolls,\r\n    possibly may have been elevated recently; but its highest part\r\n    appears (Couthouy, page 46) to be only ten feet above the\r\n    sea-level. The facts of a second class, adduced by Mr. Couthouy, in\r\n    support of the alleged recent elevation of the Low Archipelago, are\r\n    not all (especially those referring to a shelf of rock) quite\r\n    intelligible to me; he believes that certain enormous fragments of\r\n    rock on the reef, must have been moved into their present position,\r\n    when the reef was at a lower level; but here again the force of the\r\n    breakers on any inner point of the reef being diminished by its\r\n    outward growth without any change in its level, has not, I think,\r\n    been borne in mind. We should, also, not overlook the occasional\r\n    agency of waves caused by earthquakes and hurricanes. Mr. Couthouy\r\n    further argues, that since these great fragments were deposited and\r\n    fixed on the reef, they have been elevated; he infers this from the\r\n    greatest amount of erosion not being near their bases, where they\r\n    are unceasingly washed by the reflux of the tides, but at some\r\n    height on their sides, near the line of high-water mark, as shown\r\n    in an accompanying diagram. My former remark again applies here,\r\n    with this further observation, that as the waves have to roll over\r\n    a wide space of reef before they reach the fragments, their force\r\n    must be greatly increased with the increasing depth of water as the\r\n    tide rises, and therefore I should have expected that the chief\r\n    line of present erosion would have coincided with the line of\r\n    high-water mark; and if the reef had grown outwards, that there\r\n    would have been lines of erosion at greater heights. The\r\n    conclusion, to which I am finally led by the interesting\r\n    observations of Mr. Couthouy is, that the atolls in the Low\r\n    Archipelago have, like the Society Islands, remained at a\r\n    stationary level for a long period: and this probably is the\r\n    ordinary course of events, subsidence supervening after long\r\n    intervals of rest.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning now to the red colour; as on our map, the areas which have sunk\r\nslowly downwards to great depths are many and large, we might naturally\r\nhave been led to conjecture, that with such great changes of level in\r\nprogress, the coasts which have been fringed probably for ages (for we\r\nhave no reason to believe that coral-reefs are of short duration),\r\nwould not have remained all this time stationary, but would frequently\r\nhave undergone movements of elevation. This supposition, we shall\r\nimmediately see, holds good to a remarkable extent; and although a\r\nstationary condition of the land can hardly ever be open to proof, from\r\nthe evidence being only negative, we are, in some degree, enabled to\r\nascertain the correctness of the parts coloured red on the map, by the\r\ndirect testimony of upraised organic remains of a modern date. Before\r\ngoing into the details on this head (printed in small type), I may\r\nmention, that when reading a memoir on coral formations by MM. Quoy and\r\nGaimard[6] I was astonished to find, for I knew that they had crossed\r\nboth the Pacific and Indian Oceans, that their descriptions were\r\napplicable only to reefs of the fringing class; but my astonishment\r\nended satisfactorily, when I discovered that, by a strange chance, all\r\nthe islands which these eminent naturalists had visited, though several\r\nin number, namely, the Mauritius, Timor, New Guinea, the Mariana, and\r\nSandwich Archipelagoes, could be shown by their own statements to have\r\nbeen elevated within a recent geological era.\r\n\r\n [6] “Annales des Sciences Nat.” tom. vi., page 279, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the eastern half of the Pacific, the _Sandwich Islands_ are all\r\nfringed, and almost every naturalist who has visited them, has remarked\r\non the abundance of elevated corals and shells, apparently identical\r\nwith living species. The Rev. W. Ellis informs me, that he has noticed\r\nround several parts of Hawaii, beds of coral-detritus, about twenty\r\nfeet above the level of the sea, and where the coast is low they extend\r\nfar inland. Upraised coral-rock forms a considerable part of the\r\nborders of Oahu; and at Elizabeth Island[7] it composes three strata,\r\neach about ten feet thick. Nihau, which forms the northern, as Hawaii\r\ndoes the southern end of the group (350 miles in length), likewise\r\nseems to consist of coral and volcanic rocks. Mr. Couthouy[8] has\r\nlately described with interesting details, several upraised beaches,\r\nancient reefs with their surfaces perfectly preserved, and beds of\r\nrecent shells and corals, at the islands of Maui, Morokai, Oahu, and\r\nTauai (or Kauai) in this group. Mr. Pierce, an intelligent resident at\r\nOahu, is convinced, from changes which have taken place within his\r\nmemory, during the last sixteen years, “that the elevation is at\r\npresent going forward at a very perceptible rate.” The natives at Kauai\r\nstate that the land is there gaining rapidly on the sea, and Mr.\r\nCouthouy has no doubt, from the nature of the strata, that this has\r\nbeen effected by an elevation of the land.\r\n\r\n [7] “Zoology of Captain Beechey’s Voyage,” page 176. See also MM. Quoy\r\n and Gaimard in “Annales de Scien. Nat.” tom. vi.\r\n\r\n\r\n [8] “Remarks on Coral Formations,” page 51.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the southern part of the Low Archipelago, Elizabeth Island is\r\ndescribed by Captain Beechey,[9] as being quite flat, and about eighty\r\nfeet in height; it is entirely composed of dead corals, forming a\r\nhoneycombed, but compact rock. In cases like this, of an island having\r\nexactly the appearance, which the elevation of any one of the smaller\r\nsurrounding atolls with a shallow lagoon would present, one is led to\r\nconclude (with little better reason, however, than the improbability of\r\nsuch small and low fabrics lasting, for an immense period, exposed to\r\nthe many destroying agents of nature), that the elevation has taken\r\nplace at an epoch not geologically remote. When merely the surface of\r\nan island of ordinary formation is strewed with marine bodies, and that\r\ncontinuously, or nearly so, from the beach to a certain height, and not\r\nabove that height, it is exceedingly improbable that such organic\r\nremains, although they may not have been specially examined, should\r\nbelong to any ancient period. It is necessary to bear these remarks in\r\nmind, in considering the evidence of the elevatory movements in the\r\nPacific and Indian Oceans, as it does not often rest on specific\r\ndeterminations, and therefore should be received with caution. Six of\r\nthe _Cook and Austral Islands_ (S.W. of the Society group), are\r\nfringed; of these, five were described to me by the Rev. J. Williams,\r\nas formed of coral-rock, associated with some basalt in Mangaia), and\r\nthe sixth as lofty and basaltic. Mangaia is nearly three hundred feet\r\nhigh, with a level summit; and according to Mr. S. Wilson[10] it is an\r\nupraised reef; “and there are in the central hollow, formerly the bed\r\nof the lagoon, many scattered patches of coral-rock, some of them\r\nraised to a height of forty feet.” These knolls of coral-rock were\r\nevidently once separate reefs in the lagoon of an atoll. Mr. Martens,\r\nat Sydney, informed me that this island is surrounded by a terrace-like\r\nplain at about the height of a hundred feet, which probably marks a\r\npause in its elevation. From these facts we may infer, perhaps, that\r\nthe Cook and Austral Islands have been upheaved at a period probably\r\nnot very remote.\r\n\r\n [9] Beechey’s “Voyage in the Pacific,” page 46, 4to edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n [10] Couthouy’s “Remarks,” page 34.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Savage Island_ (S.E. of the Friendly group), is about forty feet in\r\nheight. Forster[11] describes the plants as _already_ growing out of\r\nthe dead, but still upright and spreading trees of coral; and the\r\nyounger Forster[12] believes that an ancient lagoon is now represented\r\nby a central plain; here we cannot doubt that the elevatory forces have\r\nrecently acted. The same conclusion may be extended, though with\r\nsomewhat less certainty, to the islands of the _Friendly Group_, which\r\nhave been well described in the second and third voyages of Cook. The\r\nsurface of Tongatabou is low and level, but with some parts a hundred\r\nfeet high; the whole consists of coral-rock, “which yet shows the\r\ncavities and irregularities worn into it by the action of the\r\ntides.”[13] On Eoua the same appearances were noticed at an elevation\r\nof between two hundred and three hundred feet. Vavao, also, at the\r\nopposite or northern end of the group, consists, according to the Rev.\r\nJ. Williams, of coral-rock. Tongatabou, with its northern extensive\r\nreefs, resembles either an upraised atoll with one half originally\r\nimperfect, or one unequally elevated; and Anamouka, an atoll equally\r\nelevated. This latter island contains[14] in its centre a salt-water\r\nlake, about a mile-and-a-half in diameter, without any communication\r\nwith the sea, and around it the land rises gradually like a bank; the\r\nhighest part is only between twenty and thirty feet; but on this part,\r\nas well as on the rest of the land (which, as Cook observes, rises\r\nabove the height of true lagoon-islands), coral-rock, like that on the\r\nbeach, was found. In the _Navigator Archipelago_, Mr. Couthouy[15]\r\nfound on Manua many and very large fragments of coral at the height of\r\neighty feet, “on a steep hill-side, rising half a mile inland from a\r\nlow sandy plain abounding in marine remains.” The fragments were\r\nembedded in a mixture of decomposed lava and sand. It is not stated\r\nwhether they were accompanied by shells, or whether the corals\r\nresembled recent species; as these remains were embedded they possibly\r\nmay belong to a remote epoch; but I presume this was not the opinion of\r\nMr. Couthouy. Earthquakes are very frequent in this archipelago.\r\n\r\n [11] “Observations made during Voyage round the World,” page 147.\r\n\r\n\r\n [12] “Voyage,” volume ii., page 163.\r\n\r\n\r\n [13] Cook’s “Third Voyage” (4to edition), volume i., page 314.\r\n\r\n\r\n [14] Ibid., volume i., page 235.\r\n\r\n\r\n [15] “Remarks on Coral-Formations,” page 50.\r\n\r\n\r\nStill proceeding westward we come to the _New Hebrides;_ on these\r\nislands, Mr. G. Bennett (author of “Wanderings in New South Wales”),\r\ninforms me he found much coral at a great altitude, which he considered\r\nof recent origin. Respecting _Santa Cruz_, and the _Salomon\r\nArchipelago_, I have no information; but at New Ireland, which forms\r\nthe northern point of the latter chain, both Labillardière and Lesson\r\nhave described large beds of an apparently very modern madreporitic\r\nrock, with the form of the corals little altered. The latter author[16]\r\nstates that this formation composes a newer line of coast, modelled\r\nround an ancient one. There only remains to be described in the\r\nPacific, that curved line of fringed islands, of which the _Marianas_\r\nform the main part. Of these Guam, Rota, Tiniam, Saypan, and some\r\nislets farther north, are described by Quoy and Gaimard,[17] and\r\nChamisso,[18] as chiefly composed of madreporitic limestone, which\r\nattains a considerable elevation, and is in several cases worn into\r\nsuccessively rising cliffs: the two former naturalists seem to have\r\ncompared the corals and shells with the existing ones, and state that\r\nthey are of recent species. _Fais_, which lies in the prolonged line of\r\nthe Marianas, is the only island in this part of the sea which is\r\nfringed; it is ninety feet high, and consists entirely of madreporitic\r\nrock.[19]\r\n\r\n [16] “Voyage de la ‘Coquille’,” Part.

M. Lesson[20] states, that near Port Dory, on the\r\nnorth coast of New Guinea, the shores are flanked, to the height of 150\r\nfeet, by madreporitic strata of modern date. He mentions similar\r\nformations at Waigiou, Amboina, Bourou, Ceram, Sonda, and Timor: at\r\nthis latter place, MM. Quoy and Gaimard[21] have likewise described the\r\nprimitive rocks, as coated to a considerable height with coral. Some\r\nsmall islets eastward of Timor are said in Kolff’s “Voyage,”[22] to\r\nresemble small coral islets upraised some feet above the sea. Dr.\r\nMalcolmson informs me that Dr. Hardie found in _Java_ an extensive\r\nformation, containing an abundance of shells, of which the greater part\r\nappear to be of existing species. Dr. Jack[23] has described some\r\nupraised shells and corals, apparently recent, on Pulo Nias off\r\n_Sumatra;_ and Marsden relates in his history of this great island,\r\nthat the names of many promontories, show that they were originally\r\nislands. On part of the west coast of _Borneo_ and at the _Sooloo\r\nIslands_, the form of the land, the nature of the soil, and the\r\nwater-washed rocks, present appearances[24] (although it is doubtful\r\nwhether such vague evidence is worthy of mention), of having recently\r\nbeen covered by the sea; and the inhabitants of the Sooloo Islands\r\nbelieve that this has been the case. Mr. Cuming, who has lately\r\ninvestigated, with so much success, the natural history of the\r\n_Phillippines_, found near Cabagan, in Luzon, about fifty feet above\r\nthe level of the R. Cagayan, and seventy miles from its mouth, a large\r\nbed of fossil shells: these, he informs me, are of the same species\r\nwith those now existing on the shores of the neighbouring islands. From\r\nthe accounts given us by Captain Basil Hall and Captain Beechey[25] of\r\nthe lines of inland reefs, and walls of coral-rock worn into caves,\r\nabove the present reach of the waves, at the _Loo Choo_ Islands, there\r\ncan be little doubt that they have been upraised at no very remote\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n [20] Partie Zoolog., “Voyage de la ‘Coquille’.”\r\n\r\n\r\n [21] “Ann. des Scien.

On the\r\n Peninsula of Malacca, in front of Pinang, 5° 30′ N., Dr. Ward\r\n collected some shells, which Dr. Malcolmson informs me, although not\r\n compared with existing species, had a recent appearance. Dr. Ward\r\n describes in this neighbourhood (“Trans. Asiat. Soc.” volume xviii.,\r\n part ii., page 166) a single water-worn rock, with a conglomerate of\r\n sea-shells at its base, situated six miles inland, which, according to\r\n the traditions of the natives, was once surrounded by the sea. Captain\r\n Low has also described (Ibid., part i., page 131) mounds of shells\r\n lying two miles inland on this line of coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n [24] “Notices of the East Indian Arch.” Singapore, 1828, page 6, and\r\n Append., page 43.\r\n\r\n\r\n [25] Captain B. Hall, “Voyage to Loo Choo,” Append., pages xxi. and\r\n xxv. Captain Beechey’s “Voyage,” page 496.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Davy[26] describes the northern province of _Ceylon_ as being very\r\nlow, and consisting of a limestone with shells and corals of very\r\nrecent origin; he adds, that it does not admit of a doubt that the sea\r\nhas retired from this district even within the memory of man. There is\r\nalso some reason for believing that the western shores of India, north\r\nof Ceylon, have been upraised within the recent period.[27] _Mauritius_\r\nhas certainly been upraised within the recent period, as I have stated\r\nin the chapter on fringing-reefs. The northern extremity of\r\n_Madagascar_ is described by Captain Owen[28] as formed of madreporitic\r\nrock, as likewise are the shores and outlying islands along an immense\r\nspace of _Eastern Africa_, from a little north of the equator for nine\r\nhundred miles southward. Nothing can be more vague than the expression\r\n“madreporitic rock;” but at the same time it is, I think, scarcely\r\npossible to look at the chart of the linear islets, which rise to a\r\ngreater height than can be accounted for by the growth of coral, in\r\nfront of the coast, from the equator to 2° S., without feeling\r\nconvinced that a line of fringing-reefs has been elevated at a period\r\nso recent, that no great changes have since taken place on the surface\r\nof this part of the globe. Some, also, of the higher islands of\r\nmadreporitic rock on this coast, for instance Pemba, have very singular\r\nforms, which seem to show the combined effect of the growth of coral\r\nround submerged banks, and their subsequent upheaval. Dr. Allan informs\r\nme that he never observed any elevated organic remains on the\r\n_Seychelles_, which come under our fringed class.\r\n\r\n [26] “Travels in Ceylon,” page 13. This madreporitic formation is\r\n mentioned by M. Cordier in his report to the Institute (May 4th,\r\n 1839), on the voyage of the “Chevrette”, as one of immense extent, and\r\n belonging to the latest tertiary period.\r\n\r\n\r\n [27] Dr. Benza, in his “Journey through the N. Circars” (the “Madras\r\n Lit. and Scient. Journ.” volume v.) has described a formation with\r\n recent fresh-water and marine shells, occurring at the distance of\r\n three or four miles from the present shore. Dr. Benza, in conversation\r\n with me, attributed their position to a rise of the land. Dr.\r\n Malcolmson, however (and there cannot be a higher authority on the\r\n geology of India) informs me that he suspects that these beds may have\r\n been formed by the mere action of the waves and currents accumulating\r\n sediment. From analogy I should much incline to Dr. Benza’s opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n [28] Owen’s “Africa,” volume ii., page 37, for Madagascar; and for S.\r\n Africa, volume i., pages 412 and 426. Lieutenant Boteler’s narrative\r\n contains fuller particulars regarding the coral-rock, volume i., page\r\n 174, and volume ii., pages 41 and 54. See also Ruschenberger’s “Voyage\r\n round the World,” volume i., page 60.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe nature of the formations round the shores of the _Red Sea_, as\r\ndescribed by several authors, shows that the whole of this large area\r\nhas been elevated within a very recent tertiary epoch. A part of this\r\nspace in the appended map, is coloured blue, indicating the presence of\r\nbarrier-reefs: on which circumstance I shall presently make some\r\nremarks. Rüppell[29] states that the tertiary formation, of which he\r\nhas examined the organic remains, forms a fringe along the shores with\r\na uniform height of from thirty and forty feet from the mouth of the\r\nGulf of Suez to about latitude 26°; but that south of 26°, the beds\r\nattain only the height of from twelve to fifteen feet. This, however,\r\ncan hardly be quite accurate; although possibly there may be a decrease\r\nin the elevation of the shores in the middle parts of the Red Sea, for\r\nDr. Malcolmson (as he informs me) collected from the cliffs of Camaran\r\nIsland (latitude 15° 30′ S.) shells and corals, apparently recent, at a\r\nheight between thirty and forty feet; and Mr. Salt (“Travels in\r\nAbyssinia”) describes a similar formation a little southward on the\r\nopposite shore at Amphila. Moreover, near the mouth of the Gulf of\r\nSuez, although on the coast opposite to that on which Dr. Rüppell says\r\nthat the modern beds attain a height of only thirty to forty feet, Mr.\r\nBurton[30] found a deposit replete with existing species of shells, at\r\nthe height of 200 feet. In an admirable series of drawings by Captain\r\nMoresby, I could see how continuously the cliff-bounded low plains of\r\nthis formation extended with a nearly equable height, both on the\r\neastern and western shores. The southern coast of Arabia seems to have\r\nbeen subjected to the same elevatory movement, for Dr. Malcolmson found\r\nat Sahar low cliffs containing shells and corals, apparently of recent\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n [29] Rüppell, “Reise in Abyssinien,” Band i., s. 141.\r\n\r\n\r\n [30] Lyell’s “Principles of Geology,” 5th edition, volume iv., page\r\n 25.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Persian Gulf_ abounds with coral-reefs; but as it is difficult to\r\ndistinguish them from sand-banks in this shallow sea, I have coloured\r\nonly some near the mouth; towards the head of the gulf Mr.\r\nAinsworth[31] says that the land is worn into terraces, and that the\r\nbeds contain organic remains of existing forms. The _West Indian\r\nArchipelago_ of “fringed” islands, alone remains to be mentioned;\r\nevidence of an elevation within a late tertiary epoch of nearly the\r\nwhole of this great area, may be found in the works of almost all the\r\nnaturalists who have visited it. I will give some of the principal\r\nreferences in a note.[32]\r\n\r\n [31] Ainsworth’s “Assyria and Babylon,” page 217.\r\n\r\n\r\n [32] On Florida and the north shores of the Gulf of Mexico, Rogers’\r\n “Report to Brit.

Soc.,\r\n orally described some very modern beds lying on the N.W. parts of\r\n Cuba. I might have added many other less important references.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very remarkable on reviewing these details, to observe in how\r\nmany instances fringing-reefs round the shores, have coincided with the\r\nexistence on the land of upraised organic remains, which seem, from\r\nevidence more or less satisfactory, to belong to a late tertiary\r\nperiod. It may, however, be objected, that similar proofs of elevation,\r\nperhaps, occur on the coasts coloured blue in our map: but this\r\ncertainly is not the case with the few following and doubtful\r\nexceptions.\r\n\r\nThe entire area of the Red Sea appears to have been upraised within a\r\nmodern period; nevertheless I have been compelled (though on\r\nunsatisfactory evidence, as given in the Appendix) to class the reefs\r\nin the middle part, as barrier-reefs; should, however, the statements\r\nprove accurate to the less height of the tertiary bed in this middle\r\npart, compared with the northern and southern districts, we might well\r\nsuspect that it had subsided subsequently to the general elevation by\r\nwhich the whole area has been upraised. Several authors[33] have stated\r\nthat they have observed shells and corals high up on the mountains of\r\nthe Society Islands,—a group encircled by barrier-reefs, and,\r\ntherefore, supposed to have subsided: at Tahiti Mr. Stutchbury found on\r\nthe apex of one of the highest mountains, between 5,000 and 7,000 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea, “a distinct and regular stratum of\r\nsemi-fossil coral.” At Tahiti, however, other naturalists, as well as\r\nmyself, have searched in vain at a low level near the coast, for\r\nupraised shells or masses of coral-reef, where if present they could\r\nhardly have been overlooked. From this fact, I concluded that probably\r\nthe organic remains strewed high up on the surface of the land, had\r\noriginally been embedded in the volcanic strata, and had subsequently\r\nbeen washed out by the rain. I have since heard from the Rev. W. Ellis,\r\nthat the remains which he met with, were (as he believes)\r\ninterstratified with an argillaceous tuff; this likewise was the case\r\nwith the shells observed by the Rev. D. Tyerman at Huaheine. These\r\nremains have not been specifically examined; they may, therefore, and\r\nespecially the stratum observed by Mr. Stutchbury at an immense height,\r\nbe contemporaneous with the first formation of the Society Islands, and\r\nbe of any degree of antiquity; or they may have been deposited at some\r\nsubsequent, but probably not very recent, period of elevation; for if\r\nthe period had been recent, the entire surface of the coast land of\r\nthese islands, where the reefs are so extensive, would have been coated\r\nwith upraised coral, which certainly is not the case. Two of the\r\nHarvey, or Cook Islands, namely, Aitutaki and Manouai, are encircled by\r\nreefs, which extend so far from the land, that I have coloured them\r\nblue, although with much hesitation, as the space within the reef is\r\nshallow, and the outline of the land is not abrupt. These two islands\r\nconsist of coral-rock; but I have no evidence of their recent\r\nelevation, besides, the improbability of Mangaia, a fringed island in\r\nthe same group (but distant 170 miles), having retained its nearly\r\nperfect atoll-like structure, during any immense lapse of time after\r\nits upheaval. The Red Sea, therefore, is the only area in which we have\r\nclear proofs of the recent elevation of a district, which, by our\r\ntheory (although the barrier-reefs are there not well characterised),\r\nhas lately subsided. But we have no reason to be surprised at\r\noscillation, of level of this kind having occasionally taken place.\r\nThere can be scarcely any doubt that Savage, Aurora,[34] and Mangaia\r\nIslands, and several of the islands in the Friendly group, existed\r\noriginally as atolls, and these have undoubtedly since been upraised to\r\nsome height above the level of the sea; so that by our theory, there\r\nhas here, also, been an oscillation of level, —elevation having\r\nsucceeded subsidence, instead of, as in the middle part of the Red Sea\r\nand at the Harvey Islands, subsidence having probably succeeded recent\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n [33] Ellis, in his “Polynesian Researches,” was the first to call\r\n attention to these remains (volume i., page 38), and the tradition of\r\n the natives concerning them. See also Williams, “Nar. of Missionary\r\n Enterprise,” page 21; also Tyerman and G. Bennett, “Journal of\r\n Voyage,” volume i., page 213; also Mr. Couthouy’s “Remarks,” page 51;\r\n but this principal fact, namely, that there is a mass of upraised\r\n coral on the narrow peninsula of Tiarubu, is from hearsay evidence;\r\n also Mr. Stutchbury, “West of England Journal,” No. i., page 54. There\r\n is a passage in Von Zach, “Corres. Astronom.” volume x., page 266,\r\n inferring an uprising at Tahiti, from a footpath now used, which was\r\n formerly impassable; but I particularly inquired from several native\r\n chiefs, whether they knew of any change of this kind, and they were\r\n unanimous in giving me an answer in the negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n [34] Aurora Island is described by Mr. Couthouy (“Remarks,” page 58);\r\n it lies 120 miles north-east of Tahiti; it is not coloured in the\r\n appended map, because it does not appear to be fringed by living\r\n reefs. Mr. Couthouy describes its summit as “presenting a broad\r\n table-land which declines a few feet towards the centre, where we may\r\n suppose the lagoon to have been placed.” It is about two hundred feet\r\n in height, and consists of reef-rock and conglomerate, with existing\r\n species of coral embedded in it. The island has been elevated at two\r\n successive periods; the cliffs being marked halfway up with a\r\n horizontal water-worn line of deep excavations. Aurora Island seems\r\n closely to resemble in structure Elizabeth Island, at the southern end\r\n of the Low Archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting fact, that Fais, which, from its composition,\r\nform, height, and situation at the western end of the Caroline\r\nArchipelago, one is strongly induced to believe existed before its\r\nupheaval as an atoll, lies exactly in the prolongation of the curved\r\nline of the Mariana group, which we know to be a line of recent\r\nelevation. I may add, that Elizabeth Island, in the southern part of\r\nthe Low Archipelago, which seems to have had the same kind of origin as\r\nFais, lies near Pitcairn Island, the only one in this part of the ocean\r\nwhich is high, and at the same time not surrounded by an encircling\r\nbarrier-reef.\r\n\r\n_On the absence of active Volcanoes in the areas of subsidence, and on\r\ntheir frequent presence in the areas of elevation._—Before making some\r\nconcluding remarks on the relations of the spaces coloured blue and\r\nred, it will be convenient to consider the position on our map of the\r\nvolcanoes historically known to have been in action. It is impossible\r\nnot to be struck, first with the absence of volcanoes in the great\r\nareas of subsidence tinted pale and dark blue,—namely, in the central\r\nparts of the Indian Ocean, in the China Sea, in the sea between the\r\nbarriers of Australia and New Caledonia, in the Caroline, Marshall,\r\nGilbert, and Low Archipelagoes; and, secondly, with the coincidence of\r\nthe principal volcanic chains with the parts coloured red, which\r\nindicates the presence of fringing-reefs; and, as we have just seen,\r\nthe presence in most cases of upraised organic remains of a modern\r\ndate. I may here remark that the reefs were all coloured before the\r\nvolcanoes were added to the map, or indeed before I knew of the\r\nexistence of several of them.\r\n\r\nThe volcano in Torres Strait, at the northern point of Australia, is\r\nthat which lies nearest to a large subsiding area, although situated\r\n125 miles within the outer margin of the actual barrier-reef. The Great\r\nComoro Island, which probably contains a volcano, is only twenty miles\r\ndistant from the barrier-reef of Mohila; Ambil volcano, in the\r\nPhilippines, is distant only a little more than sixty miles from the\r\natoll-formed Appoo reef: and there are two other volcanoes in the map\r\nwithin ninety miles of circles coloured blue. These few cases, which\r\nthus offer partial exceptions to the rule, of volcanoes being placed\r\nremote from the areas of subsidence, lie either near single and\r\nisolated atolls, or near small groups of encircled islands; and these\r\nby our theory can have, in few instances, subsided to the same amount\r\nin depth or area, as groups of atolls. There is not one active volcano\r\nwithin several hundred miles of an archipelago, or even a small group\r\nof atolls. It is, therefore, a striking fact that in the Friendly\r\nArchipelago, which owes its origin to the elevation of a group of\r\natolls, two volcanoes, and, perhaps, others[35] are known to be in\r\naction: on the other hand, on several of the encircled islands in the\r\nPacific, supposed by our theory to have subsided, there are old craters\r\nand streams of lava, which show the effects of past and ancient\r\neruptions. In these cases, it would appear as if the volcanoes had come\r\ninto action, and had become extinguished on the same spots, according\r\nas the elevating or subsiding movements prevailed.\r\n\r\n [35] See the note at p. 121, on the authorities for colouring the\r\n volcanoes in the appended map.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are some other coasts on the map, where volcanoes in a state of\r\naction concur with proofs of recent elevation, besides those coloured\r\nred from being fringed by coral-reefs. Thus I hope to show in a future\r\nvolume, that nearly the whole line of the west coast of South America,\r\nwhich forms the greatest volcanic chain in the world, from near the\r\nequator for a space of between 2,000 and 3,000 miles southward, has\r\nundergone an upward movement during a late geological period. The\r\nislands on the north-western shores of the Pacific, which form the\r\nsecond greatest volcanic chain, are very imperfectly known; but Luzon,\r\nin the Philippines, and the Loo Choo Islands, have been recently\r\nelevated; and at Kamtschatka[36] there are extensive tertiary beds of\r\nmodern date. Evidence of the same nature, but not very satisfactory,\r\nmay be detected in Northern New Zealand where there are two volcanoes.\r\nThe co-existence in other parts of the world of active volcanoes, with\r\nupraised beds of a modern tertiary origin, will occur to every\r\ngeologist.[37] Nevertheless, until it could be shown that volcanoes\r\nwere inactive, or did not exist in subsiding areas, the conclusion that\r\ntheir distribution depended on the nature of the subterranean movements\r\nin progress, would have been hazardous. But now, viewing the appended\r\nmap, it may, I think, be considered as almost established, that\r\nvolcanoes are often (not necessarily always) present in those areas\r\nwhere the subterranean motive power has lately forced, or is now\r\nforcing outwards, the crust of the earth, but that they are invariably\r\nabsent in those, where the surface has lately subsided or is still\r\nsubsiding.[38]\r\n\r\n [36] At Sedanka, in latitude 58° N. (Von Buch’s “Descrip. des Isles\r\n Canaries,” page 455). In a forthcoming part, I shall give the evidence\r\n referred to with respect to the elevation of New Zealand.\r\n\r\n\r\n [37] During the subterranean disturbances which took place in Chile,\r\n in 1835, I have shown (“Geolog. Trans.” 2nd Ser., vol. v., page 606)\r\n that at the same moment that a large district was upraised, volcanic\r\n matter burst forth at widely separated points, through both new and\r\n old vents.\r\n\r\n\r\n [38] We may infer from this rule, that in any old deposit, which\r\n contains interstratified beds of erupted matter, there was at the\r\n period, and in the area of its formation, a _tendency_ to an upward\r\n movement in the earth’s surface, and certainly no movement of\r\n subsidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the relations of the areas of Subsidence and Elevation_.—The\r\nimmense surfaces on the map, which, both by our theory and by the plain\r\nevidence of upraised marine remains, have undergone a change of level\r\neither downwards or upwards during a late period, is a most remarkable\r\nfact. The existence of continents shows that the areas have been\r\nimmense which at some period have been upraised; in South America we\r\nmay feel sure, and on the north-western shores of the Indian Ocean we\r\nmay suspect, that this rising is either now actually in progress, or\r\nhas taken place quite recently. By our theory, we may conclude that the\r\nareas are likewise immense which have lately subsided, or, judging from\r\nthe earthquakes occasionally felt and from other appearances, are now\r\nsubsiding. The smallness of the scale of our map should not be\r\noverlooked: each of the squares on it contains (not allowing for the\r\ncurvature of the earth) 810,000 square miles. Look at the space of\r\nocean from near the southern end of the Low Archipelago to the northern\r\nend of the Marshall Archipelago, a length of 4,500 miles, in which, as\r\nfar as is known, every island, except Aurora which lies just without\r\nthe Low Archipelago, is atoll-formed. The eastern and western\r\nboundaries of our map are continents, and they are rising areas: the\r\ncentral spaces of the great Indian and Pacific Oceans, are mostly\r\nsubsiding; between them, north of Australia, lies the most broken land\r\non the globe, and there the rising parts are surrounded and penetrated\r\nby areas of subsidence,[39] so that the prevailing movements now in\r\nprogress, seem to accord with the actual states of surface of the great\r\ndivisions of the world.\r\n\r\n [39] I suspect that the Arru and Timor-laut Islands present an\r\n included small area of subsidence, like that of the China Sea, but I\r\n have not ventured to colour them from my imperfect information, as\r\n given in the Appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blue spaces on the map are nearly all elongated; but it does not\r\nnecessarily follow from this (a caution, for which I am indebted to Mr.\r\nLyell), that the areas of subsidence were likewise elongated; for the\r\nsubsidence of a long, narrow space of the bed of the ocean, including\r\nin it a transverse chain of mountains, surmounted by atolls, would only\r\nbe marked on the map by a transverse blue band. But where a chain of\r\natolls and barrier-reefs lies in an elongated area, between spaces\r\ncoloured red, which therefore have remained stationary or have been\r\nupraised, this must have resulted either from the area of subsidence\r\nhaving originally been elongated (owing to some tendency in the earth’s\r\ncrust thus to subside), or from the subsiding area having originally\r\nbeen of an irregular figure, or as broad as long, and having since been\r\nnarrowed by the elevation of neighbouring districts. Thus the areas,\r\nwhich subsided during the formation of the great north and south lines\r\nof atolls in the Indian Ocean,—of the east and west line of the\r\nCaroline atolls,—and of the north-west and south-east line of the\r\nbarrier-reefs of New Caledonia and Louisiade, must have originally been\r\nelongated, or if not so, they must have since been made elongated by\r\nelevations, which we know to belong to a recent period.\r\n\r\nI infer from Mr. Hopkins’ researches,[40] that for the formation of a\r\nlong chain of mountains, with few lateral spurs, an area elongated in\r\nthe same direction with the chain, must have been subjected to an\r\nelevatory movement. Mountain-chains, however, when already formed,\r\nalthough running in very different directions, it seems,[41] may be\r\nraised together by a widely-acting force: so, perhaps, mountain-chains\r\nmay subside together. Hence, we cannot tell, whether the Caroline and\r\nMarshall Archipelagoes, two groups of atolls running in different\r\ndirections and meeting each other, have been formed by the subsidence\r\nof two areas, or of one large area, including two distinct lines of\r\nmountains. We have, however, in the southern prolongation of the\r\nMariana Islands, probable evidence of a line of recent elevation having\r\nintersected one of recent subsidence. A view of the map will show that,\r\ngenerally, there is a tendency to alternation in the parallel areas\r\nundergoing opposite kinds of movement; as if the sinking of one area\r\nbalanced the rising of another.\r\n\r\n [40] “Researches in Physical Geology,” Transact. Cambridge Phil. Soc.,\r\n volume vi, part i.\r\n\r\n\r\n [41] For instance in S. America from latitude 34°, for very many\r\n degrees southward there are upraised beds containing recent species of\r\n shells, on both the Atlantic and Pacific side of the continent, and\r\n from the gradual ascent of the land, although with very unequal\r\n slopes, on both sides towards the Cordillera, I think it can hardly be\r\n doubted that the entire width has been upraised in mass within the\r\n recent period. In this case the two W.N.W. and E.S.E. mountain-lines,\r\n namely the Sierra Ventana and the S. Tapalguen, and the great north\r\n and south line of the Cordillera have been together raised. In the\r\n West Indies the N. and S. line of the Eastern Antilles, and the E. and\r\n W. line of Jamaica, appear both to have been upraised within the\r\n latest geological period.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence in many parts of the world of high table-land, proves\r\nthat large surfaces have been upraised in mass to considerable heights\r\nabove the level of the ocean; although the highest points in almost\r\nevery country consist of upturned strata, or erupted matter: and from\r\nthe immense spaces scattered with atolls, which indicate that land\r\noriginally existed there, although not one pinnacle now remains above\r\nthe level of the sea, we may conclude that wide areas have subsided to\r\nan amount, sufficient to bury not only any formerly existing\r\ntable-land, but even the heights formed by fractured strata, and\r\nerupted matter. The effects produced on the land by the later elevatory\r\nmovements, namely, successively rising cliffs, lines of erosion, and\r\nbeds of literal shells and pebbles, all requiring time for their\r\nproduction, prove that these movements have been very slow; we can,\r\nhowever, infer this with safety, only with respect to the few last\r\nhundred feet of rise. But with reference to the whole vast amount of\r\nsubsidence, necessary to have produced the many atolls widely scattered\r\nover immense spaces, it has already been shown (and it is, perhaps, the\r\nmost interesting conclusion in this volume), that the movements must\r\neither have been uniform and exceedingly slow, or have been effected by\r\nsmall steps, separated from each other by long intervals of time,\r\nduring which the reef-constructing polypifers were able to bring up\r\ntheir solid frameworks to the surface. We have little means of judging\r\nwhether many considerable oscillations of level have generally occurred\r\nduring the elevation of large tracts; but we know, from clear\r\ngeological evidence, that this has frequently taken place; and we have\r\nseen on our map, that some of the same islands have both subsided and\r\nbeen upraised. I conclude, however, that most of the large blue spaces,\r\nhave subsided without many and great elevatory oscillations, because\r\nonly a few upraised atolls have been observed: the supposition that\r\nsuch elevations have taken place, but that the upraised parts have been\r\nworn down by the surf, and thus have escaped observation, is overruled\r\nby the very considerable depth of the lagoons of all the larger atolls;\r\nfor this could not have been the case, if they had suffered repeated\r\nelevations and abrasion. From the comparative observations made in\r\nthese latter pages, we may finally conclude, that the subterranean\r\nchanges which have caused some large areas to rise, and others to\r\nsubside, have acted in a very similar manner.\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation_.—In the three first chapters, the principal kinds of\r\ncoral-reefs were described in detail, and they were found to differ\r\nlittle, as far as relates to the actual surface of the reef. An atoll\r\ndiffers from an encircling barrier-reef only in the absence of land\r\nwithin its central expanse; and a barrier-reef differs from a\r\nfringing-reef, in being placed at a much greater distance from the land\r\nwith reference to the probable inclination of its submarine foundation,\r\nand in the presence of a deep-water lagoon-like space or moat within\r\nthe reef. In the fourth chapter the growing powers of the\r\nreef-constructing polypifers were discussed; and it was shown, that\r\nthey cannot flourish beneath a very limited depth. In accordance with\r\nthis limit, there is no difficulty respecting the foundations on which\r\nfringing-reefs are based; whereas, with barrier-reefs and atolls, there\r\nis a great apparent difficulty on this head; in barrier-reefs from the\r\nimprobability of the rock of the coast or of banks of sediment\r\nextending, in every instance, so far seaward within the required\r\ndepth;—and in atolls, from the immensity of the spaces over which they\r\nare interspersed, and the apparent necessity for believing that they\r\nare all supported on mountain-summits, which although rising very near\r\nto the surface-level of the sea, in no one instance emerge above it. To\r\nescape this latter most improbable admission, which implies the\r\nexistence of submarine chains of mountains of almost the same height,\r\nextending over areas of many thousand square miles, there is but one\r\nalternative; namely, the prolonged subsidence of the foundations, on\r\nwhich the atolls were primarily based, together with the upward growth\r\nof the reef-constructing corals. On this view every difficulty\r\nvanishes; fringing reefs are thus converted into barrier-reefs; and\r\nbarrier-reefs, when encircling islands, are thus converted into atolls,\r\nthe instant the last pinnacle of land sinks beneath the surface of the\r\nocean.\r\n\r\nThus the ordinary forms and certain peculiarities in the structure of\r\natolls and barrier-reefs can be explained;—namely, the wall-like\r\nstructure on their inner sides, the basin or ring-like shape both of\r\nthe marginal and central reefs in the Maldiva atolls—the union of some\r\natolls as if by a ribbon—the apparent disseverment of others—and the\r\noccurrence, in atolls as well as in barrier-reefs, of portions of reef,\r\nand of the whole of some reefs, in a dead and submerged state, but\r\nretaining the outline of living reefs. Thus can be explained the\r\nexistence of breaches through barrier-reefs in front of valleys, though\r\nseparated from them by a wide space of deep water; thus, also, the\r\nordinary outline of groups of atolls and the relative forms of the\r\nseparate atolls one to another; thus can be explained the proximity of\r\nthe two kinds of reefs formed during subsidence, and their separation\r\nfrom the spaces where fringing-reefs abound. On searching for other\r\nevidence of the movements supposed by our theory, we find marks of\r\nchange in atolls and in barrier-reefs, and of subterranean disturbances\r\nunder them; but from the nature of things, it is scarcely possible to\r\ndetect any direct proofs of subsidence, although some appearances are\r\nstrongly in favour of it. On the fringed coasts, however, the presence\r\nof upraised marine bodies of a recent epoch, plainly show, that these\r\ncoasts, instead of having remained stationary, which is all that can be\r\ndirectly inferred from our theory, have generally been elevated.\r\n\r\nFinally, when the two great types of structure, namely barrier-reefs\r\nand atolls on the one hand, and fringing-reefs on the other, were laid\r\ndown in colours on our map, a magnificent and harmonious picture of the\r\nmovements, which the crust of the earth has within a late period\r\nundergone, is presented to us. We there see vast areas rising, with\r\nvolcanic matter every now and then bursting forth through the vents or\r\nfissures with which they are traversed. We see other wide spaces slowly\r\nsinking without any volcanic outburst, and we may feel sure, that this\r\nsinking must have been immense in amount as well as in area, thus to\r\nhave buried over the broad face of the ocean every one of those\r\nmountains, above which atolls now stand like monuments, marking the\r\nplace of their former existence. Reflecting how powerful an agent with\r\nrespect to denudation, and consequently to the nature and thickness of\r\nthe deposits in accumulation, the sea must ever be, when acting for\r\nprolonged periods on the land, during either its slow emergence or\r\nsubsidence; reflecting, also, on the final effects of these movements\r\nin the interchange of land and ocean-water on the climate of the earth,\r\nand on the distribution of organic beings, I may be permitted to hope,\r\nthat the conclusions derived from the study of coral-formations,\r\noriginally attempted merely to explain their peculiar forms, may be\r\nthought worthy of the attention of geologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\nCONTAINING A DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE REEFS AND ISLANDS IN PLATE\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the last chapter I stated the principles on which\r\nthe map is coloured. There only remains to be said, that it is an exact\r\ncopy of one by M. C. Gressier, published by the Dépôt général de la\r\nMarine, in 1835. The names have been altered into English, and the\r\nlongitude has been reduced to that of Greenwich. The colours were first\r\nlaid down on accurate charts, on a large scale. The data, on which the\r\nvolcanoes historically known to have been in action, have been marked\r\nwith vermillion, were given in a note to the last chapter. I will\r\ncommence my description on the eastern side of the map, and will\r\ndescribe each group of islands consecutively, proceeding westward\r\nacross the Pacific and Indian Oceans, but ending with the West Indies.\r\n\r\nThe WESTERN SHORES OF AMERICA appear to be entirely without\r\ncoral-reefs; south of the equator the survey of the “Beagle”, and north\r\nof it, the published charts show that this is the case. Even in the Bay\r\nof _Panama_, where corals flourish, there are no true coral-reefs, as I\r\nhave been informed by Mr. Lloyd. There are no coral-reefs in the\r\n_Galapagos_ Archipelago, as I know from personal inspection; and I\r\nbelieve there are none on the _Cocos, Revilla-gigedo_, and other\r\nneighbouring islands. _Clipperton_ rock, 10° N., 109° W., has lately\r\nbeen surveyed by Captain Belcher; in form it is like the crater of a\r\nvolcano. From a drawing appended to the MS. plan in the Admiralty, it\r\nevidently is not an atoll. The eastern parts of the Pacific present an\r\nenormous area, without any islands, except _Easter_, and _Sala_, and\r\n_Gomez_ Islands, which do not appear to be surrounded by reefs.\r\n\r\nThe LOW ARCHIPELAGO.—This group consists of about eighty atolls: it\r\nwill be quite superfluous to refer to descriptions of each. In\r\nD’Urville and Lottin’s chart, one island (_Wolchonsky_) is written with\r\na capital letter, signifying, as explained in a former chapter, that it\r\nis a high island; but this must be a mistake, as the original chart by\r\nBellinghausen shows that it is a true atoll. Captain Beechey says of\r\nthe thirty-two groups which he examined (of the greater number of which\r\nI have seen beautiful MS. charts in the Admiralty), that twenty-nine\r\nnow contain lagoons, and he believes the other three originally did.\r\nBellinghausen (see an account of his Russian voyage, in the “Biblioth.\r\ndes Voyages,” 1834, page 443) says, that the seventeen islands which he\r\ndiscovered resembled each other in structure, and he has given charts\r\non a large scale of all of them. Kotzebue has given plans of several;\r\nCook and Bligh mention others; a few were seen during the voyage of the\r\n“Beagle”; and notices of other atolls are scattered through several\r\npublications. The _Actæon_ group in this archipelago has lately been\r\ndiscovered (“Geographical Journal”, volume vii., page 454); it consists\r\nof three small and low islets, one of which has a lagoon. Another\r\nlagoon-island has been discovered (“Naut. Mag.” 1839, page 770), in 22°\r\n4′ S., and 136° 20′ W. Towards the S.E. part of the group, there are\r\nsome islands of different formation: _Elizabeth_ Island is described by\r\nBeechey (page 46, 4to edition) as fringed by reefs, at the distance of\r\nbetween two and three hundred yards; coloured red. _Pitcairn_ Island,\r\nin the immediate neighbourhood, according to the same authority, has no\r\nreefs of any kind, although numerous pieces of coral are thrown up on\r\nthe beach; the sea close to its shore is very deep (see “Zool. of\r\nBeechey’s Voyage,” page 164); it is left uncoloured. _Gambier_ Islands\r\n(see Plate I., Figure 8), are encircled by a barrier-reef; the greatest\r\ndepth within is thirty-eight fathoms; coloured pale blue. _Aurora_\r\nIsland, which lies N.E. of Tahiti close to the large space coloured\r\ndark blue in the map, has been already described in a note (page 71),\r\non the authority of Mr. Couthouy; it is an upraised atoll, but as it\r\ndoes not appear to be fringed by living reefs, it is left uncoloured.\r\n\r\nThe SOCIETY Archipelago is separated by a narrow space from the Low\r\nArchipelago; and in their parallel direction they manifest some\r\nrelation to each other. I have already described the general character\r\nof the reefs of these fine encircled islands. In the “Atlas of the\r\n‘Coquille’s’ Voyage” there is a good general chart of the group, and\r\nseparate plans of some of the islands. _Tahiti_, the largest island in\r\nthe group, is almost surrounded, as seen in Cook’s chart, by a reef\r\nfrom half a mile to a mile and a half from the shore, with from ten to\r\nthirty fathoms within it. Some considerable submerged reefs lying\r\nparallel to the shore, with a broad and deep space within, have lately\r\nbeen discovered (“Naut. Mag.” 1836, page 264) on the N.E. coast of the\r\nisland, where none are laid down by Cook. At _Eimeo_ the reef “which\r\nlike a ring surrounds it, is in some places one or two miles distant\r\nfrom the shore, in others united to the beach” (Ellis, “Polynesian\r\nResearches,” volume i., page 18, 12mo edition). Cook found deep water\r\n(twenty fathoms) in some of the harbours within the reef. Mr. Couthouy,\r\nhowever, states (“Remarks,” page 45) that both at Tahiti and Eimeo, the\r\nspace between the barrier-reef and the shore, has been almost filled\r\nup,—“a nearly continuous fringing-reef surrounding the island, and\r\nvarying from a few yards to rather more than a mile in width, the\r\nlagoons merely forming canals between this and the sea-reef,” that is\r\nthe barrier-reef. _Tapamanoa_ is surrounded by a reef at a considerable\r\ndistance from the shore; from the island being small it is breached, as\r\nI am informed by the Rev. W. Ellis, only by a narrow and crooked boat\r\nchannel. This is the lowest island in the group, its height probably\r\nnot exceeding 500 feet. A little way north of Tahiti, the low\r\ncoral-islets of _Teturoa_ are situated; from the description of them\r\ngiven me by the Rev. J. Williams (the author of the “Narrative of\r\nMissionary Enterprise”), I should have thought they had formed a small\r\natoll, and likewise from the description given by the Rev. D. Tyerman\r\nand G. Bennett (“Journal of Voyage and Travels,” volume i., page 183),\r\nwho say that ten low coral-islets “are comprehended within one general\r\nreef, and separated from each other by interjacent lagoons;” but as Mr.\r\nStutchbury (“West of England Journal,” volume i., page 54) describes it\r\nas consisting of a mere narrow ridge, I have left it uncoloured.\r\n_Maitea_, eastward of the group, is classed by Forster as a high\r\nencircled island; but from the account given by the Rev. D. Tyerman and\r\nG. Bennett (volume i., page 57) it appears to be an exceedingly abrupt\r\ncone, rising from the sea without any reef; I have left it uncoloured.\r\nIt would be superfluous to describe the northern islands in this group,\r\nas they may be well seen in the chart accompanying the 4to edition of\r\nCook’s “Voyages,” and in the “Atlas of the ‘Coquille’s’ Voyage.”\r\n_Maurua_ is the only one of the northern islands, in which the water\r\nwithin the reef is not deep, being only four and a half fathoms; but\r\nthe great width of the reef, stretching three miles and a half\r\nsouthward of the land (which is represented in the drawing in the\r\n“Atlas of the ‘Coquille’s’ Voyage” as descending abruptly to the water)\r\nshows, on the principle explained in the beginning of the last chapter,\r\nthat it belongs to the barrier class. I may here mention, from\r\ninformation communicated to me by the Rev. W. Ellis, that on the N.E.\r\nside of _Huaheine_ there is a bank of sand, about a quarter of a mile\r\nwide, extending parallel to the shore, and separated from it by an\r\nextensive and deep lagoon; this bank of sand rests on coral-rock, and\r\nundoubtedly was originally a living reef. North of Bolabola lies the\r\natoll of _Toubai_ (Motou-iti of the “‘Coquille’s’ Atlas”) which is\r\ncoloured dark blue; the other islands, surrounded by barrier-reefs, are\r\npale blue; three of them are represented in Figures 3, 4, and 5, in\r\nPlate I. There are three low coral-groups lying a little E. of the\r\nSociety Archipelago, and almost forming part of it, namely\r\n_Bellinghausen_, which is said by Kotzebue (“Second Voyage,” volume\r\nii., page 255), to be a lagoon-island; _Mopeha_, which, from Cook’s\r\ndescription (“Second Voyage,” book iii., chapter i.), no doubt is an\r\natoll; and the _Scilly_ Islands, which are said by Wallis (“Voyage,”\r\nchapter ix.) to form a _group_ of _low_ islets and shoals, and,\r\ntherefore, probably, they compose an atoll: the two former have been\r\ncoloured blue, but not the latter.\r\n\r\nMENDANA or MARQUESAS Group.—These islands are entirely without reefs,\r\nas may be seen in Krusenstern’s Atlas, making a remarkable contrast\r\nwith the adjacent group of the Society Islands. Mr. F.D. Bennett has\r\ngiven some account of this group, in the seventh volume of the\r\n“Geographical Journal”. He informs me that all the islands have the\r\nsame general character, and that the water is very deep close to their\r\nshores. He visited three of them, namely, _Dominicana_, _Christiana_,\r\nand _Roapoa;_ their beaches are strewed with rounded masses of coral,\r\nand although no regular reefs exist, yet the shore is in many places\r\nlined by coral-rock, so that a boat grounds on this formation. Hence\r\nthese islands ought probably to come within the class of fringed\r\nislands and be coloured red; but as I am determined to err on the\r\ncautious side, I have left them uncoloured.\r\n\r\nCOOK or HARVEY and AUSTRAL ISLAND.—_Palmerston_ Island is minutely\r\ndescribed as an atoll by Captain Cook during his voyage in 1774;\r\ncoloured blue. _Aitutaki_ was partially surveyed by the “Beagle” (see\r\nmap accompanying “Voyages of ‘Adventure’ and ‘Beagle’”); the land is\r\nhilly, sloping gently to the beach; the highest point is 360 feet; on\r\nthe southern side the reef projects five miles from the land: off this\r\npoint the “Beagle” found no bottom with 270 fathoms: the reef is\r\nsurmounted by many low coral-islets. Although within the reef the water\r\nis exceedingly shallow, not being more than a few feet deep, as I am\r\ninformed by the Rev. J. Williams, nevertheless, from the great\r\nextension of this reef into a profoundly deep ocean, this island\r\nprobably belongs, on the principle lately adverted to, to the barrier\r\nclass, and I have coloured it pale blue; although with much\r\nhesitation.—_Manouai_ or _Harvey_ Island. The highest point is about\r\nfifty feet: the Rev. J. Williams informs me that the reef here,\r\nalthough it lies far from the shore, is less distant than at Aitutaki,\r\nbut the water within the reef is rather deeper: I have also coloured\r\nthis pale blue with many doubts.—Round _Mitiaro_ Island, as I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Williams, the reef is attached to the shore; coloured\r\nred. —_Mauki_ or Maouti; the reef round this island (under the name of\r\nParry Island, in the “Voyage of H.M.S. ‘Blonde’,” page 209) is\r\ndescribed as a coral-flat, only fifty yards wide, and two feet under\r\nwater. This statement has been corroborated by Mr. Williams, who calls\r\nthe reef attached; coloured red.—_Aitu_, or Wateeo; a moderately\r\nelevated hilly island, like the others of this group. The reef is\r\ndescribed in Cook’s “Voyage,” as attached to the shore, and about one\r\nhundred yards wide; coloured red.—_Fenoua-iti;_ Cook describes this\r\nisland as very low, not more than six or seven feet high (volume i.,\r\nbook ii., chapter iii, 1777); in the chart published in the\r\n“‘Coquille’s’ Atlas,” a reef is engraved close to the shore: this\r\nisland is not mentioned in the list given by Mr. Williams (page 16) in\r\nthe “Narrative of Missionary Enterprise;” nature doubtful. As it is so\r\nnear Atiu, it has been unavoidably coloured red.— _Rarotonga;_ Mr.\r\nWilliams informs me that it is a lofty basaltic island with an attached\r\nreef; coloured red.—There are three islands, _Rourouti_, _Roxburgh_,\r\nand _Hull_, of which I have not been able to obtain any account, and\r\nhave left them uncoloured. Hull Island, in the French chart, is written\r\nwith small letters as being low.—_Mangaia;_ height about three hundred\r\nfeet; “the surrounding reef joins the shore” (Williams, “Narrative,”\r\npage 18); coloured red.—_Rimetara;_ Mr. Williams informs me that the\r\nreef is rather close to the shore; but, from information given me by\r\nMr. Ellis, the reef does not appear to be quite so closely attached to\r\nit as in the foregoing cases: the island is about three hundred feet\r\nhigh (“Naut. Mag.” 1839, page 738); coloured red.—_Rurutu;_ Mr.\r\nWilliams and Mr. Ellis inform me that this island has an attached reef;\r\ncoloured red. It is described by Cook under the name of Oheteroa: he\r\nsays it is not surrounded, like the neighbouring islands by a reef; he\r\nmust have meant a distant reef.—_Toubouai;_ in Cook’s chart (“Second\r\nVoyage,” volume ii., page 2) the reef is laid down in part one mile,\r\nand in part two miles from the shore. Mr. Ellis (“Polynes. Res.” volume\r\niii., page 381) says the low land round the base of the island is very\r\nextensive; and this gentleman informs me that the water within the reef\r\nappears deep; coloured blue.—_Raivaivai_, or Vivitao; Mr. Williams\r\ninforms me that the reef is here distant: Mr. Ellis, however, says that\r\nthis is certainly not the case on one side of the island; and he\r\nbelieves that the water within the reef is not deep; hence I have left\r\nit uncoloured.—_Lancaster_ Reef, described in “Naut. Mag.” 1833 (page\r\n693), as an extensive crescent-formed coral-reef. I have not coloured\r\nit.—_Rapa_, or Oparree; from the accounts given of it by Ellis and\r\nVancouver, there does not appear to be any reef.—_I. de Bass_ is an\r\nadjoining island, of which I cannot find any account.—_Kemin_ Island;\r\nKrusenstern seems hardly to know its position, and gives no further\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\nISLANDS BETWEEN _the Low and Gilbert Archipelagoes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caroline_ Island (10° S., 150° W.) is described by Mr. F.D. Bennett\r\n(“Geographical Journal”, volume vii., page 225) as containing a fine\r\nlagoon; coloured blue.—_Flint_ Island (11° S., 151° W.); Krusenstern\r\nbelieves that it is the same with _Peregrino_, which is described by\r\nQuiros (Burney’s “Chron. Hist.” volume ii., page 283) as “a cluster of\r\nsmall islands connected by a reef, and forming a lagoon in the middle;”\r\ncoloured blue.—_Wostock_ is an island a little more than half a mile in\r\ndiameter, and apparently quite flat and low, and was discovered by\r\nBellinghausen; it is situated a little west of Caroline Island, but it\r\nis not placed on the French charts; I have not coloured it, although I\r\nentertain little doubt from the chart of Bellinghausen, that it\r\noriginally contained a small lagoon.—_Penrhyn_ Island (9° S., 158° W.);\r\na plan of it in the “Atlas of the First Voyage” of Kotzebue, shows that\r\nit is an atoll; blue.— _Starbuck_ Island (5° S., 156° W.) is described\r\nin Byron’s “Voyage in the ‘Blonde’” (page 206) as formed of a flat\r\ncoral-rock, with no trees; the height not given; not coloured.—_Malden_\r\nIsland (4° S., 154° W.); in the same voyage (page 205) this island is\r\nsaid to be of coral formation, and no part above forty feet high; I\r\nhave not ventured to colour it, although, from being of\r\ncoral-formation, it is probably fringed; in which case it should be\r\nred.—_Jarvis_, or _Bunker_ Island (0° 20′ S., 160° W.) is described by\r\nMr. F.D. Bennett (“Geographical Journal”, volume vii., page 227) as a\r\nnarrow, low strip of coral-formation; not coloured.—_Brook_, is a small\r\nlow island between the two latter; the position, and perhaps even the\r\nexistence of it is doubtful; not coloured.—_Pescado_ and _Humphrey_\r\nIslands; I can find out nothing about these islands, except that the\r\nlatter appears to be small and low; not coloured.—_Rearson_, or Grand\r\nDuke Alexander’s (10 S., 161° W.); an atoll, of which a plan is given\r\nby Bellinghausen; blue.— _Souvoroff_ Islands (13° S., 163° W.); Admiral\r\nKrusenstern, in the most obliging manner, obtained for me an account of\r\nthese islands from Admiral Lazareff, who discovered them. They consist\r\nof five very low islands of coral-formation, two of which are connected\r\nby a reef, with deep water close to it. They do not surround a lagoon,\r\nbut are so placed that a line drawn through them includes an oval\r\nspace, part of which is shallow; these islets, therefore, probably once\r\n(as is the case with some of the islands in the Caroline Archipelago)\r\nformed a single atoll; but I have not coloured them.—_Danger_ Island\r\n(10° S., 166° W.); described as low by Commodore Byron, and more lately\r\nsurveyed by Bellinghausen; it is a small atoll with three islets on it;\r\nblue.—_Clarence_ Island (9° S., 172° W.); discovered in the “Pandora”\r\n(G. Hamilton’s “Voyage,” page 75): it is said, “in running along the\r\nland, we saw several canoes crossing the _lagoons;_” as this island is\r\nin the close vicinity of other low islands, and as it is said, that the\r\nnatives make reservoirs of water in old cocoa-nut trees (which shows\r\nthe nature of the land), I have no doubt it is an atoll, and have\r\ncoloured it blue. _York_ Island (8° S., 172° W.) is described by\r\nCommodore Byron (chapter x. of his “Voyage”) as an atoll;\r\nblue.—_Sydney_ Island (4° S., 172° W.) is about three miles in\r\ndiameter, with its interior occupied by a lagoon (Captain Tromelin,\r\n“Annal. Marit.” 1829, page 297); blue.—_Phœnix_ Island (4° S., 171° W.)\r\nis nearly circular, low, sandy, not more than two miles in diameter,\r\nand very steep outside (Tromelin, “Annal. Marit.” 1829, page 297); it\r\nmay be inferred that this island originally contained a lagoon, but I\r\nhave not coloured it.—_New Nantucket_ (0° 15′ N., 174° W.). From the\r\nFrench chart it must be a low island; I can find nothing more about it\r\nor about _Mary_ Island; both uncoloured.—_Gardner_ Island (5° S., 174°\r\nW.) from its position is certainly the same as _Kemin_ Island described\r\n(Krusenstern, page 435, Appen. to Mem., published 1827) as having a\r\nlagoon in its centre; blue.\r\n\r\nISLANDS SOUTH _of the Sandwich Archipelago_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Christmas_ Island (2° N., 157° W.). Captain Cook, in his “Third\r\nVoyage” (Volume ii., chapter x.), has given a detailed account of this\r\natoll. The breadth of the islets on the reef is unusually great, and\r\nthe sea near it does not deepen so suddenly as is generally the case.\r\nIt has more lately been visited by Mr. F.D. Bennett (“Geographical\r\nJournal,” volume vii., page 226); and he assures me that it is low and\r\nof coral-formation: I particularly mention this, because it is engraved\r\nwith a capital letter, signifying a high island, in D’Urville and\r\nLottin’s chart. Mr. Couthouy, also, has given some account of it\r\n(“Remarks,” page 46) from the Hawaiian “Spectator”; he believes it has\r\nlately undergone a small elevation, but his evidence does not appear to\r\nme satisfactory; the deepest part of the lagoon is said to be only ten\r\nfeet; nevertheless, I have coloured it blue.—_Fanning_ Island (4° N.,\r\n158° W.) according to Captain Tromelin (“Ann. Maritim.” 1829, page\r\n283), is an atoll: his account as observed by Krusenstern, differs from\r\nthat given in Fanning’s “Voyage” (page 224), which, however, is far\r\nfrom clear; coloured blue.— _Washington_ Island (4° N., 159° W.) is\r\nengraved as a low island in D’Urville’s chart, but is described by\r\nFanning (page 226) as having a much greater elevation than Fanning\r\nIsland, and hence I presume it is not an atoll; not coloured.—_Palmyra_\r\nIsland (6° N., 162° W.) is an atoll divided into two parts\r\n(Krusenstern’s “Mem. Suppl.” page 50, also Fanning’s “Voyage,” page\r\n233); blue.—_Smyth’s_ or Johnston’s Islands (17° N., 170° W.). Captain\r\nSmyth, R.N., has had the kindness to inform me that they consist of two\r\nvery low, small islands, with a dangerous reef off the east end of\r\nthem. Captain Smyth does not recollect whether these islets, together\r\nwith the reef, surrounded a lagoon; uncoloured.\r\n\r\nSANDWICH ARCHIPELAGO.—_Hawaii;_ in the chart in Freycinet’s “Atlas,”\r\nsmall portions of the coast are fringed by reefs; and in the\r\naccompanying “Hydrog. Memoir,” reefs are mentioned in several places,\r\nand the coral is said to injure the cables. On one side of the islet of\r\nKohaihai there is a bank of sand and coral with five feet water on it,\r\nrunning parallel to the shore, and leaving a channel of about fifteen\r\nfeet deep within. I have coloured this island red, but it is very much\r\nless perfectly fringed than others of the group.—_Maui;_ in Freycinet’s\r\nchart of the anchorage of Raheina, two or three miles of coast are seen\r\nto be fringed; and in the “Hydrog. Memoir,” “banks of coral along\r\nshore” are spoken of. Mr. F.D. Bennett informs me that the reefs, on an\r\naverage, extend about a quarter of a mile from the beach; the land is\r\nnot very steep, and outside the reefs the sea does not become deep very\r\nsuddenly; coloured red.—_Morotoi_, I presume, is fringed: Freycinet\r\nspeaks of the breakers extending along the shore at a little distance\r\nfrom it. From the chart, I believe it is fringed; coloured red.—_Oahu;_\r\nFreycinet, in his “Hydrog. Memoir,” mentions some of the reefs. Mr.\r\nF.D. Bennett informs me that the shore is skirted for forty or fifty\r\nmiles in length. There is even a harbour for ships formed by the reefs,\r\nbut it is at the mouth of a valley; red.—_Atooi_, in La Peyrouse’s\r\ncharts, is represented as fringed by a reef, in the same manner as Oahu\r\nand Morotoi; and this, as I have been informed by Mr. Ellis, on part at\r\nleast of the shore, is of coral-formation: the reef does not leave a\r\ndeep channel within; red.—_Oneehow;_ Mr. Ellis believes that this\r\nisland is also fringed by a coral-reef: considering its close proximity\r\nto the other islands, I have ventured to colour it red. I have in vain\r\nconsulted the works of Cook, Vancouver, La Peyrouse, and Lisiansky, for\r\nany satisfactory account of the small islands and reefs, which lie\r\nscattered in a N.W. line prolonged from the Sandwich group, and hence\r\nhave left them uncoloured, with one exception; for I am indebted to Mr.\r\nF.D. Bennett for informing me of an atoll-formed reef, in latitude 28°\r\n22′, longitude 178° 30′ W., on which the “Gledstanes” was wrecked in\r\n1837. It is apparently of large size, and extends in a N.W. and S.E.\r\nline: very few islets have been formed on it. The lagoon seems to be\r\nshallow; at least, the deepest part which was surveyed was only three\r\nfathoms. Mr. Couthouy (“Remarks,” page 38) describes this island under\r\nthe name of _Ocean_ island. Considerable doubts should be entertained\r\nregarding the nature of a reef of this kind, with a very shallow\r\nlagoon, and standing far from any other atoll, on account of the\r\npossibility of a crater or flat bank of rock lying at the proper depth\r\nbeneath the surface of the water, thus affording a foundation for a\r\nring-formed coral-reef. I have, however, thought myself compelled, from\r\nits large size and symmetrical outline, to colour it blue.\r\n\r\nSAMOA or NAVIGATOR GROUP.—Kotzebue, in his “Second Voyage,” contrasts\r\nthe structure of these islands with many others in the Pacific, in not\r\nbeing furnished with harbours for ships, formed by distant coral-reefs.\r\nThe Rev. J. Williams, however, informs me, that coral-reefs do occur in\r\nirregular patches on the shores of these islands; but that they do not\r\nform a continuous band, as round Mangaia, and other such perfect cases\r\nof fringed islands. From the charts accompanying La Peyrouse’s\r\n“Voyage,” it appears that the north shore of _Savaii_, _Maouna_,\r\n_Orosenga_, and _Mannua_, are fringed by reefs. La Peyrouse, speaking\r\nof Maouna (page 126), says that the coral-reef surrounding its shores,\r\nalmost touches the beach; and is breached in front of the little coves\r\nand streams, forming passages for canoes, and probably even for boats.\r\nFurther on (page 159), he extends the same observation to all the\r\nislands which he visited. Mr. Williams in his “Narrative,” speaks of a\r\nreef going round a small island attached to _Oyolava_, and returning\r\nagain to it: all these islands have been coloured red.—A chart of\r\n_Rose_ Island, at the extreme west end of the group, is given by\r\nFreycinet, from which I should have thought that it had been an atoll;\r\nbut according to Mr. Couthouy (“Remarks,” page 43), it consists of a\r\nreef, only a league in circuit, surmounted by a very few low islets;\r\nthe lagoon is very shallow, and is strewed with numerous large boulders\r\nof volcanic rock. This island, therefore, probably consists of a bank\r\nof rock, a few feet submerged, with the outer margin of its upper\r\nsurface fringed with reefs; hence it cannot be properly classed with\r\natolls, in which the foundations are always supposed to lie at a depth,\r\ngreater than that at which the reef-constructing polypifers can live;\r\nnot coloured.\r\n\r\n_Beveridge Reef_, 20° S., 167° W., is described in the “Naut. Mag.”\r\n(May 1833, page 442) as ten miles long in a N. and S. line, and eight\r\nwide; “in the inside of the reef there appears deep water;” there is a\r\npassage near the S.W. corner: this therefore seems to be a submerged\r\natoll, and is coloured blue.\r\n\r\n_Savage_ Island, 19° S., 170° W., has been described by Cook and\r\nForster. The younger Forster (volume ii., page 163) says it is about\r\nforty feet high: he suspects that it contains a low plain, which\r\nformerly was the lagoon. The Rev. J. Williams informs me that the reef\r\nfringing its shores, resembles that round Mangaia; coloured red.\r\n\r\nFRIENDLY ARCHIPELAGO. _Pylstaart_ Island. Judging from the chart in\r\nFreycinet’s “Atlas,” I should have supposed that it had been regularly\r\nfringed; but as nothing is said in the “Hydrog. Memoir” (or in the\r\n“Voyage” of Tasman, the discoverer) about coral-reefs, I have left it\r\nuncoloured.—_Tongatabou:_ In the “Atlas of the Voyage of the\r\n‘Astrolabe’,” the whole south side of the island is represented as\r\nnarrowly fringed by the same reef which forms an extensive platform on\r\nthe northern side. The origin of this latter reef, which might have\r\nbeen mistaken for a barrier-reef, has already been attempted to be\r\nexplained, when giving the proofs of the recent elevation of this\r\nisland.— In Cook’s charts the little outlying island also of _Eoaigee_,\r\nis represented as fringed; coloured red.—_Eoua_. I cannot make out from\r\nCaptain Cook’s charts and descriptions, that this island has any reef,\r\nalthough the bottom of the neighbouring sea seems to be corally, and\r\nthe island itself is formed of coral-rock. Forster, however, distinctly\r\n(“Observations,” page 14) classes it with high islands having reefs,\r\nbut it certainly is not encircled by a barrier-reef and the younger\r\nForster (“Voyage,” volume i., page 426) says, that “a bed of\r\ncoral-rocks surrounded the coast towards the landing-place.” I have\r\ntherefore classed it with the fringed islands and coloured it red. The\r\nseveral islands lying N.W. of Tongatabou, namely _Anamouka_, _Komango_,\r\n_Kotou_, _Lefouga_, _Foa_, &c., are seen in Captain Cook’s chart to be\r\nfringed by reefs, in several of them are connected together. From the\r\nvarious statements in the first volume of Cook’s “Third Voyage,” and\r\nespecially in the fourth and sixth chapters, it appears that these\r\nreefs are of coral-formation, and certainly do not belong to the\r\nbarrier class; coloured red.—_Toufoua_ & _Kao_, forming the western\r\npart of the group, according to Forster have no reefs; the former is an\r\nactive volcano.—_Vavao_. There is a chart of this singularly formed\r\nisland, by Espinoza: according to Mr. Williams it consists of\r\ncoral-rock: the Chevalier Dillon informs me that it is not fringed; not\r\ncoloured. Nor are the islands of _Latte_ and _Amargura_, for I have not\r\nseen plans on a large scale of them, and do not know whether they are\r\nfringed.\r\n\r\n_Niouha_, 16° S., 174° W., or _Keppel_ Island of Wallis, or _Cocos_\r\nIsland. From a view and chart of this island given in Wallis’s “Voyage”\r\n(4to edition) it is evidently encircled by a reef; coloured blue: it is\r\nhowever remarkable that _Boscawen_ Island, immediately adjoining, has\r\nno reef of any kind; uncoloured.\r\n\r\n_Wallis Island_, 13° S., 176° W., a chart and view of this island in\r\nWallis’s “Voyage” (4to edition) shows that it is encircled. A view of\r\nit in the “Naut. Mag.” July 1833, page 376, shows the same fact; blue.\r\n\r\n_Alloufatou_, or _Horn_ Island, _Onouafu_, or _Proby_ Island, and\r\n_Hunter_ Islands, lie between the Navigator and Fidji groups. I can\r\nfind no distinct accounts of them.\r\n\r\nFIDJI or VITI GROUP.—The best chart of the numerous islands of this\r\ngroup, will be found in the “Atlas of the ‘Astrolabe’s’ Voyage.” From\r\nthis, and from the description given in the “Hydrog. Memoir,”\r\naccompanying it, it appears that many of these islands are bold and\r\nmountainous, rising to the height of between 3,000 and 4,000 feet. Most\r\nof the islands are surrounded by reefs, lying far from the land, and\r\noutside of which the ocean appears very deep. The “Astrolabe” sounded\r\nwith ninety fathoms in several places about a mile from the reefs, and\r\nfound no bottom. Although the depth within the reef is not laid down,\r\nit is evident from several expressions, that Captain D’Urville believes\r\nthat ships could anchor within, if passages existed through the outer\r\nbarriers. The Chevallier Dillon informs me that this is the case: hence\r\nI have coloured this group blue. In the S.E. part lies _Batoa_, or\r\n_Turtle_ Island of Cook (“Second Voyage,” volume ii., page 23, and\r\nchart, 4to edition) surrounded by a coral-reef, “which in some places\r\nextends two miles from the shore;” within the reef the water appears to\r\nbe deep, and outside it is unfathomable; coloured pale blue. At the\r\ndistance of a few miles, Captain Cook (Ibid., page 24) found a circular\r\ncoral-reef, four or five leagues in circuit, with deep water within;\r\n“in short, the bank wants only a few little islets to make it exactly\r\nlike one of the half-drowned isles so often mentioned,”—namely, atolls.\r\nSouth of Batoa, lies the high island of _Ono_, which appears in\r\nBellinghausen’s “Atlas” to be encircled; as do some other small islands\r\nto the south; coloured pale blue; near Ono, there is an annular reef,\r\nquite similar to the one just described in the words of Captain Cook;\r\ncoloured dark blue.\r\n\r\n_Rotoumah_, 13° S., 179° E.—From the chart in Duperrey’s “Atlas,” I\r\nthought this island was encircled, and had coloured it blue, but the\r\nChevallier Dillon assures me that the reef is only a shore or fringing\r\none; red.\r\n\r\n_Independence_ Island, 10° S., 179° E., is described by Mr. G. Bennett,\r\n(“United Service Journal,” 1831, part ii., page 197) as a low island of\r\ncoral-formation, it is small, and does not appear to contain a lagoon,\r\nalthough an opening through the reef is referred to. A lagoon probably\r\nonce existed, and has since been filled up; left uncoloured.\r\n\r\nELLICE GROUP.—_Oscar_, _Peyster_, and _Ellice_ Islands are figured in\r\nArrowsmith’s “Chart of the Pacific” (corrected to 1832) as atolls, and\r\nare said to be very low; blue.—_Nederlandisch_ Island. I am greatly\r\nindebted to the kindness of Admiral Krusenstern, for sending me the\r\noriginal documents concerning this island. From the plans given by\r\nCaptains Eeg and Khremtshenko, and from the detailed account given by\r\nthe former, it appears that it is a narrow coral-island, about two\r\nmiles long, containing a small lagoon. The sea is very deep close to\r\nthe shore, which is fronted by sharp coral-rocks. Captain Eeg compares\r\nthe lagoon with that of other coral-islands; and he distinctly says,\r\nthe land is “very low.” I have therefore coloured it blue. Admiral\r\nKrusenstern (“Memoir on the Pacific,” Append., 1835) states that its\r\nshores are eighty feet high; this probably arose from the height of the\r\ncocoa-nut trees, with which it is covered, being mistaken for land.\r\n—_Gran Cocal_ is said in Krusenstern’s “Memoir,” to be low, and to be\r\nsurrounded by a reef; it is small, and therefore probably once\r\ncontained a lagoon; uncoloured.—_St. Augustin_. From a chart and view\r\nof it, given in the “Atlas of the ‘Coquille’s’ Voyage,” it appears to\r\nbe a small atoll, with its lagoon partly filled up; coloured blue.\r\n\r\nGILBERT GROUP.—The chart of this group, given in the “Atlas of the\r\n‘Coquille’s’ Voyage,” at once shows that it is composed of ten well\r\ncharacterised atolls. In D’Urville and Lottin’s chart, _Sydenham_ is\r\nwritten with a capital letter, signifying that it is high; but this\r\ncertainly is not the case, for it is a perfectly characterised atoll,\r\nand a sketch, showing how low it is, is given in the “‘Coquille’s’\r\nAtlas.” Some narrow strip-like reefs project from the southern side of\r\n_Drummond_ atoll, and render it irregular. The southern island of the\r\ngroup is called _Chase_ (in some charts, _Rotches_); of this I can find\r\nno account, but Mr. F.D. Bennett discovered (“Geographical Journal”,\r\nvolume vii., page 229), a low extensive island in nearly the same\r\nlatitude, about three degrees westward of the longitude assigned to\r\nRotches, but very probably it is the same island. Mr. Bennett informs\r\nme that the man at the masthead reported an appearance of lagoon-water\r\nin the centre; and, therefore, considering its position, I have\r\ncoloured it blue. —_Pitt_ Island, at the extreme northern point of the\r\ngroup, is left uncoloured, as its exact position and nature is not\r\nknown.—_Byron_ Island, which lies a little to the eastward, does not\r\nappear to have been visited since Commodore Byron’s voyage, and it was\r\nthen seen only from a distance of eighteen miles; it is said to be low;\r\nuncoloured.\r\n\r\n_Ocean_, _Pleasant_, and _Atlantic_ Islands all lie considerably to the\r\nwest of the Gilbert group: I have been unable to find any distinct\r\naccount of them. Ocean Island is written with small letters in the\r\nFrench chart, but in Krusenstern’s “Memoir” it is said to be high.\r\n\r\nMARSHALL GROUP.—We are well acquainted with this group from the\r\nexcellent charts of the separate islands, made during the two voyages\r\nof Kotzebue: a reduced one of the whole group may be easily seen in\r\nKrusenstern’s “Atlas,” and in Kotzebue’s “Second Voyage.” The group\r\nconsists (with the exception of two _little_ islands which probably\r\nhave had their lagoon filled up) of a double row of twenty-three large\r\nand well-characterised atolls, from the examination of which Chamisso\r\nhas given us his well-known account of coral-formations. I include\r\n_Gaspar-Rico_, or _Cornwallis_ Island in this group, which is described\r\nby Chamisso (Kotzebue’s “First Voyage,” volume iii., page 179) “as a\r\nlow sickle-formed group, with mould only on the windward side.” Gaspard\r\nIsland is considered by some geographers as a distinct island lying\r\nN.E. of the group, but it is not entered in the chart by Krusenstern;\r\nleft uncoloured. In the S.W. part of this group lies _Baring_ Island,\r\nof which little is known (see Krusenstern’s “Appendix,” 1835, page\r\n149). I have left it uncoloured; but _Boston_ Island I have coloured\r\nblue, as it is described (Ibid.) as consisting of fourteen small\r\nislands, which, no doubt, enclose a lagoon, as represented in a chart\r\nin the “‘Coquille’s’ Atlas.”—Two islands, _Aur Kawen_ and _Gaspar\r\nRico_, are written in the French chart with capital letters; but this\r\nis an error, for from the account given by Chamisso in Kotzebue’s\r\n“First Voyage,” they are certainly low. The nature, position, and even\r\nexistence, of the shoals and small islands north of the Marshall group,\r\nare doubtful.\r\n\r\nNEW HEBRIDES.—Any chart, on even a small scale, of these islands, will\r\nshow that their shores are almost without reefs, presenting a\r\nremarkable contrast with those of New Caledonia on the one hand, and\r\nthe Fidji group on the other. Nevertheless, I have been assured by Mr.\r\nG. Bennett, that coral grows vigorously on their shores; as indeed,\r\nwill be further shown in some of the following notices. As, therefore,\r\nthese islands are not encircled, and as coral grows vigorously on their\r\nshores, we might almost conclude, without further evidence, that they\r\nwere fringed, and hence I have applied the red colour with rather\r\ngreater freedom than in other instances.—_Matthew’s Rock_, an active\r\nvolcano, some way south of the group (of which a plan is given in the\r\n“Atlas of the ‘Astrolabe’s’ Voyage”) does not appear to have reefs of\r\nany kind about it.—_Annatom_, the southernmost of the Hebrides; from a\r\nrough woodcut given in the “United Service Journal” (1831, part iii.,\r\npage 190), accompanying a paper by Mr. Bennett, it appears that the\r\nshore is fringed; coloured red.—_Tanna_. Forster, in his “Observations”\r\n(page 22), says Tanna has on its shores coral-rock and madrepores; and\r\nthe younger Forster, in his account (volume ii., page 269) speaking of\r\nthe harbour says, the whole S.E. side consists of coral-reefs, which\r\nare overflowed at high-water; part of the southern shore in Cook’s\r\nchart is represented as fringed; coloured red.—_Immer_ is described\r\n(“United Service Journal,” 1831, part iii., page 192) by Mr. Bennett as\r\nbeing of moderate elevation, with cliffs appearing like sandstone:\r\ncoral grows in patches on its shore, but I have not coloured it; and I\r\nmention these facts, because Immer might have been thought from\r\nForster’s classification (“Observations,” page 14), to have been a low\r\nisland or even an atoll.— _Erromango_ Island; Cook (“Second Voyage,”\r\nvolume ii., page 45, 4to edition) speaks of rocks everywhere _lining_\r\nthe coast, and the natives offered to haul his boat over the breakers\r\nto the sandy beach: Mr. Bennett, in a letter to the Editor of the\r\n“Singapore Chron.,” alludes to the _reefs_ on its shores. It may, I\r\nthink, be safely inferred from these passages that the shore is fringed\r\nin parts by coral-reefs; coloured red.—_Sandwich_ Island. The east\r\ncoast is said (Cook’s “Second Voyage,” volume ii., page 41) to be low,\r\nand to be guarded by a chain of breakers. In the accompanying chart it\r\nis seen to be fringed by a reef; coloured red.—_Mallicollo_; Forster\r\nspeaks of the reef-bounded shore: the reef is about thirty yards wide,\r\nand so shallow that a boat cannot pass over it. Forster also\r\n(“Observations,” page 23) says, that the rocks of the sea-shore consist\r\nof madrepore. In the plan of Sandwich harbour, the headlands are\r\nrepresented as fringed; coloured red.—_Aurora_ and _Pentecost_ Islands,\r\naccording to Bougainville, apparently have no reefs; nor has the large\r\nisland of _S. Espiritu_, nor _Bligh_ Island or _Banks’_ Islands, which\r\nlatter lie to the N.E. of the Hebrides. But in none of these cases,\r\nhave I met with any detailed account of their shores, or seen plans on\r\na large scale; and it will be evident, that a fringing-reef of only\r\nthirty or even a few hundred yards in width, is of so little importance\r\nto navigation, that it will seldom be noticed, excepting by chance; and\r\nhence I do not doubt that several of these islands, now left\r\nuncoloured, ought to be red.\r\n\r\nSANTA-CRUZ GROUP.—_Vanikoro_ (Figure 1, Plate I.) offers a striking\r\nexample of a barrier-reef: it was first described by the Chevalier\r\nDillon, in his voyage, and was surveyed in the “Astrolabe”; coloured\r\npale blue.—_Tikopia_ and _Fataka_ Islands appear, from the descriptions\r\nof Dillon and D’Urville, to have no reefs; _Anouda_ is a low, flat\r\nisland, surrounded by cliffs (“‘Astrolabe’ Hydrog.” and Krusenstern,\r\n“Mem.” volume ii., page 432); these are uncoloured. _Toupoua_\r\n(_Otooboa_ of Dillon) is stated by Captain Tromelin (“Annales Marit.”\r\n1829, page 289) to be almost entirely included in a reef, lying at the\r\ndistance of two miles from the shore. There is a space of three miles\r\nwithout any reef, which, although indented with bays, offers no\r\nanchorage from the extreme depth of the water close to the shore:\r\nCaptain Dillon also speaks of the reefs fronting this island; coloured\r\nblue.— _Santa-Cruz_. I have carefully examined the works of Carteret,\r\nD’Entrecasteaux, Wilson, and Tromelin, and I cannot discover any\r\nmention of reefs on its shores; left uncoloured.—_Tinakoro_ is a\r\nconstantly active volcano without reefs.—_Mendana Isles_ (mentioned by\r\nDillon under the name of _Mammee_, etc.); said by Krusenstern to be\r\nlow, and intertwined with reefs. I do not believe they include a\r\nlagoon; I have left them uncoloured.—_Duff’s_ Islands compose a small\r\ngroup directed in a N.W. and S.E. band; they are described by Wilson\r\n(page 296, “Miss. Voy.” 4to edition), as formed by bold-peaked land,\r\nwith the islands surrounded by coral-reefs, extending about half a mile\r\nfrom the shore; at a distance of a mile from the reefs he found only\r\nseven fathoms. As I have no reason for supposing there is deep water\r\nwithin these reefs, I have coloured them red. _Kennedy_ Island, N.E. of\r\nDuff’s. I have been unable to find any account of it.\r\n\r\nNEW CALEDONIA.—The great barrier-reefs on the shores of this island\r\nhave already been described (Figure 5, Plate II.). They have been\r\nvisited by Labillardière, Cook, and the northern point by D’Urville;\r\nthis latter part so closely resembles an atoll that I have coloured it\r\ndark blue. The _Loyalty_ group is situated eastward of this island;\r\nfrom the chart and description given in the “Voyage of the\r\n‘Astrolabe’,” they do not appear to have any reefs; north of this\r\ngroup, there are some extensive low reefs (called _Astrolabe_ and\r\n_Beaupré_,) which do not seem to be atoll-formed; these are left\r\nuncoloured.\r\n\r\nAUSTRALIAN BARRIER-REEF.—The limits of this great reef, which has\r\nalready been described, have been coloured from the charts of Flinders\r\nand King. In the northern parts, an atoll-formed reef, lying outside\r\nthe barrier, has been described by Bligh, and is coloured dark blue. In\r\nthe space between Australia and New Caledonia, called by Flinders the\r\nCorallian Sea, there are numerous reefs. Of these, some are represented\r\nin Krusenstern’s “Atlas” as having an atoll-like structure; namely,\r\n_Bampton_ shoal, _Frederic_, _Vine_ or Horse-shoe, and _Alert_ reefs;\r\nthese have been coloured dark blue.\r\n\r\nLOUISIADE: the dangerous reefs which front and surround the western,\r\nsouthern, and northern coasts of this so-called peninsula and\r\narchipelago, seem evidently to belong to the barrier class. The land is\r\nlofty, with a low fringe on the coast; the reefs are distant, and the\r\nsea outside them profoundly deep. Nearly all that is known of this\r\ngroup is derived from the labours of D’Entrecasteaux and Bougainville:\r\nthe latter has represented one continuous reef ninety miles long,\r\nparallel to the shore, and in places as much as ten miles from it;\r\ncoloured pale blue. A little distance northward we have the _Laughlan_\r\nIslands, the reefs round which are engraved in the “Atlas of the Voyage\r\nof the ‘Astrolabe’,” in the same manner as in the encircled islands of\r\nthe Caroline Archipelago, the reef is, in parts, a mile and a half from\r\nthe shore, to which it does not appear to be attached; coloured blue.\r\nAt some little distance from the extremity of the Louisiade lies the\r\n_Wells_ reef, described in G. Hamilton’s “Voyage in H.M.S. ‘Pandora’”\r\n(page 100): it is said, “We found we had got embayed in a double reef,\r\nwhich will soon be an island.” As this statement is only intelligible\r\non the supposition of the reef being crescent or horse-shoe formed,\r\nlike so many other submerged annular reefs, I have ventured to colour\r\nit blue.\r\n\r\nSALOMON ARCHIPELAGO: the chart in Krusenstern’s “Atlas” shows that\r\nthese islands are not encircled, and as coral appears from the works of\r\nSurville, Bougainville, and Labillardière, to grow on their shores,\r\nthis circumstance, as in the case of the New Hebrides, is a presumption\r\nthat they are fringed. I cannot find out anything from\r\nD’Entrecasteaux’s “Voyage,” regarding the southern islands of the\r\ngroup, so have left them uncoloured.—_Malayta_ Island in a rough MS.\r\nchart in the Admiralty has its northern shore fringed.—_Ysabel_ Island,\r\nthe N.E. part of this island, in the same chart, is also fringed:\r\nMendana, speaking (Burney, volume i., page 280) of an islet adjoining\r\nthe northern coast, says it is surrounded by reefs; the shores, also of\r\nPort Praslin appear regularly fringed.—_Choiseul_ Island. In\r\nBougainville’s “Chart of Choiseul Bay,” parts of the shores are fringed\r\nby coral-reefs.— _Bougainville_ Island. According to D’Entrecasteaux\r\nthe western shore abounds with coral-reefs, and the smaller islands are\r\nsaid to be attached to the larger ones by reefs; all the\r\nbefore-mentioned islands have been coloured red.—_Bouka_ Islands.\r\nCaptain Duperrey has kindly informed me in a letter that he passed\r\nclose round the northern side of this island (of which a plan is given\r\nin his “Atlas of the ‘Coquille’s’ Voyage”), and that it was “garnie\r\nd’une bande de récifs à fleur d’eau adherentes au rivage;” and he\r\ninfers, from the abundance of coral on the islands north and south of\r\nBouka, that the reef probably is of coral; coloured red.\r\n\r\nOff the north coast of the Solomon Archipelago there are several small\r\ngroups which are little known; they appear to be low, and of\r\ncoral-formation; and some of them probably have an atoll-like\r\nstructure; the Chevallier Dillon, however, informs me that this is not\r\nthe case with the B. de _Candelaria_.—_Outong Java_, according to the\r\nSpanish navigator, Maurelle, is thus characterised; but this is the\r\nonly one which I have ventured to colour blue.\r\n\r\nNEW IRELAND.—The shores of the S.W. point of this island and some\r\nadjoining islets, are fringed by reefs, as may be seen in the “Atlases\r\nof the Voyages of the ‘Coquille’ and ‘Astrolabe’.” M. Lesson observes\r\nthat the reefs are open in front of each streamlet. The _Duke of\r\nYork’s_ Island is also fringed; but with regard to the other parts of\r\n_New Ireland_, _New Hanover_, and the small islands lying northward, I\r\nhave been unable to obtain any information. I will only add that no\r\npart of New Ireland appears to be fronted by distant reefs. I have\r\ncoloured red only the above specified portions.\r\n\r\nNEW BRITAIN and the NORTHERN SHORE of NEW GUINEA.—From the charts in\r\nthe “Voyage of the ‘Astrolabe’,” and from the “Hydrog. Memoir,” it\r\nappears that these coasts are entirely without reefs, as are the\r\n_Schouten Islands_, lying close to the northern shore of New Guinea.\r\nThe western and south-western parts of New Guinea, will be treated of\r\nwhen we come to the islands of the East Indian Archipelago.\r\n\r\nADMIRALTY GROUP.—From the accounts by Bougainville, Maurelle,\r\nD’Entrecasteaux, and the scattered notices collected by Horsburgh, it\r\nappears, that some of the many islands composing it, are high, with a\r\nbold outline; and others are very low, small and interlaced with reefs.\r\nAll the high islands appear to be fronted by distant reefs rising\r\nabruptly from the sea, and within some of which there is reason to\r\nbelieve that the water is deep. I have therefore little doubt they are\r\nof the barrier class.—In the southern part of the group we have\r\n_Elizabeth Island_, which is surrounded by a reef at the distance of a\r\nmile; and two miles eastward of it (Krusenstern, “Append.” 1835, page\r\n42) there is a little island containing a lagoon.—Near here, also lies\r\n_Circular-reef_ (Horsburgh, “Direct.” volume i., page 691, 4th\r\nedition), “three or four miles in diameter having deep water inside\r\nwith an opening at the N.N.W. part, and on the outside steep to.” I\r\nhave from these data, coloured the group pale blue, and _circular-reef_\r\ndark blue.—the _Anachorites_, _Echequier_, and _Hermites_, consist of\r\ninnumerable low islands of coral-formation, which probably have\r\natoll-like forms; but not being able to ascertain this, I have not\r\ncoloured them, nor _Durour_ Island, which is described by Carteret as\r\nlow.\r\n\r\nThe CAROLINE ARCHIPELAGO is now well-known, chiefly from the\r\nhydrographical labours of Lutké; it contains about forty groups of\r\natolls, and three encircled islands, two of which are engraved in\r\nFigures 2 and 7, Plate I. Commencing with the eastern part; the\r\nencircling reef round _Ualen_ appears to be only about half a mile from\r\nthe shore; but as the land is low and covered with mangroves (“Voyage\r\nautour du Monde,” par F. Lutké, volume i., page 339), the real margin\r\nhas not probably been ascertained. The extreme depth in one of the\r\nharbours within the reef is thirty-three fathoms (see charts in “Atlas\r\nof ‘Coquille’s’ Voyage”), and outside at half a mile distant from the\r\nreef, no bottom was obtained with two hundred and fifty fathoms. The\r\nreef is surmounted by many islets, and the lagoon-like channel within\r\nis mostly shallow, and appears to have been much encroached on by the\r\nlow land surrounding the central mountains; these facts show that time\r\nhas allowed much detritus to accumulate; coloured pale blue.—\r\n_Pouynipète_, or _Seniavine_. In the greater part of the circumference\r\nof this island, the reef is about one mile and three quarters distant;\r\non the north side it is five miles off the included high islets. The\r\nreef is broken in several places; and just within it, the depth in one\r\nplace is thirty fathoms, and in another, twenty-eight, beyond which, to\r\nall appearance, there was “un porte vaste et sur” (Lutké, volume ii.,\r\npage 4); coloured pale blue.—_Hogoleu_ or _Roug_. This wonderful group\r\ncontains at least sixty-two islands, and its reef is one hundred and\r\nthirty-five miles in circuit. Of the islands, only a few, about six or\r\neight (see “Hydrog. Descrip.” page 428, of the “Voyage of the\r\n‘Astrolabe’,” and the large accompanying chart taken chiefly from that\r\ngiven by Duperrey) are high, and the rest are all small, low, and\r\nformed on the reef. The depth of the great interior lake has not been\r\nascertained; but Captain D’Urville appears to have entertained no doubt\r\nabout the possibility of taking in a frigate. The reef lies no less\r\nthan fourteen miles distant from the northern coasts of the interior\r\nhigh islands, seven from their western sides, and twenty from the\r\nsouthern; the sea is deep outside. This island is a likeness on a grand\r\nscale to the Gambier group in the Low Archipelago. Of the groups of\r\nlow[1] islands forming the chief part of the Caroline Archipelago, all\r\nthose of larger size, have the true atoll-structure (as may be seen in\r\nthe “Atlas” by Captain Lutké), and some even of the very small ones, as\r\n_Macaskill_ and _Duperrey_, of which plans are given in the “Atlas of\r\nthe ‘Coquille’s’ Voyage.” There are, however, some low small islands of\r\ncoral-formation, namely _Ollap_, _Tamatam_, _Bigali_, _Satahoual_,\r\nwhich do not contain lagoons; but it is probable that lagoons\r\noriginally existed, but have since filled up: Lutké (volume ii., page\r\n304) seems to have thought that all the low islands, with only one\r\nexception, contained lagoons. From the sketches, and from the manner in\r\nwhich the margins of these islands are engraved in the “Atlas of the\r\nVoyage of the ‘Coquille’,” it might have been thought that they were\r\nnot low; but by a comparison with the remarks of Lutké (volume ii.,\r\npage 107, regarding Bigali) and of Freycinet (“Hydrog. Memoir\r\n‘L’Uranie’ Voyage,” page 188, regarding Tamatam, Ollap, etc.), it will\r\nbe seen that the artist must have represented the land incorrectly. The\r\nmost southern island in the group, namely _Piguiram_, is not coloured,\r\nbecause I have found no account of it. _Nougouor_, or _Monte Verdison_,\r\nwhich was not visited by Lutké, is described and figured by Mr. Bennett\r\n(“United Service Journal,” January 1832) as an atoll. All the\r\nabove-mentioned islands have been coloured blue.\r\n\r\n [1] In D’Urville and Lottin’s chart, Peserare is written with capital\r\n letters; but this evidently is an error, for it is one of the low\r\n islets on the reef of Namonouyto (see Lutké’s charts)—a regular atoll.\r\n\r\n\r\nWESTERN PART OF THE CAROLINE ARCHIPELAGO.—_Fais_ Island is ninety feet\r\nhigh, and is surrounded, as I have been informed by Admiral Lutké, by a\r\nnarrow reef of living coral, of which the broadest part, as represented\r\nin the charts, is only 150 yards; coloured red.— _Philip_ Island., I\r\nbelieve, is low; but Hunter, in his “Historical Journal,” gives no\r\nclear account of it; uncoloured.—_Elivi;_ from the manner in which the\r\nislets on the reefs are engraved, in the “Atlas of the ‘Astrolabe’s’\r\nVoyage,” I should have thought they were above the ordinary height, but\r\nAdmiral Lutké assures me this is not the case: they form a regular\r\natoll; coloured blue.—_Gouap_ (_Eap_ of Chamisso), is a high island\r\nwith a reef (see chart in “Voyage of the ‘Astrolabe’”), more than a\r\nmile distant in most parts from the shore, and two miles in one part.\r\nCaptain D’Urville thinks that there would be anchorage (“Hydrog.\r\nDescript. ‘Astrolabe’ Voyage,” page 436) for ships within the reef, if\r\na passage could be found; coloured pale blue.—_Goulou_, from the chart\r\nin the “‘Astrolabe’s’ Atlas,” appears to be an atoll. D’Urville\r\n(“Hydrog. Descript.” page 437) speaks of the low islets on the reef;\r\ncoloured dark blue.\r\n\r\nPELEW ISLANDS.—Krusenstern speaks of some of the islands being\r\nmountainous; the reefs are distant from the shore, and there are spaces\r\nwithin them, and not opposite valleys, with from ten to fifteen\r\nfathoms. According to a MS. chart of the group by Lieutenant Elmer in\r\nthe Admiralty, there is a large space within the reef with deepish\r\nwater; although the high land does not hold a central position with\r\nrespect to the reefs, as is generally the case, I have little doubt\r\nthat the reefs of the Pelew Islands ought to be ranked with the barrier\r\nclass, and I have coloured them pale blue. In Lieutenant Elmer’s chart\r\nthere is a horseshoe-formed shoal, laid down thirteen miles N.W. of\r\nPelew, with fifteen fathoms within the reef, and some dry banks on it;\r\ncoloured dark blue.—_Spanish_, _Martires_, _Sanserot_, _Pulo Anna_ and\r\n_Mariere_ Islands are not coloured, because I know nothing about them,\r\nexcepting that according to Krusenstern, the second, third, and fourth\r\nmentioned, are low, placed on coral-reefs, and therefore, perhaps,\r\ncontain lagoons; but Pulo Mariere is a little higher.\r\n\r\nMARIANA ARCHIPELAGO, or LADRONES.—_Guahan_. Almost the whole of this\r\nisland is fringed by reefs, which extend in most parts about a third of\r\na mile from the land. Even where the reefs are most extensive, the\r\nwater within them is shallow. In several parts there is a navigable\r\nchannel for boats and canoes within the reefs. In Freycinet’s “Hydrog.\r\nMem.” there is an account of these reefs, and in the “Atlas,” a map on\r\na large scale; coloured red.—_Rota_. “L’ile est presque entièrement\r\nentourée des récifs” (page 212, Freycinet’s “Hydrog. Mem.”). These\r\nreefs project about a quarter of a mile from the shore; coloured\r\nred.—_Tinian_. The eastern coast is precipitous, and is without reefs;\r\nbut the western side is fringed like the last island; coloured\r\nred.—_Saypan_. The N.E. coast, and likewise the western shores appear\r\nto be fringed; but there is a great, irregular, horn-like reef\r\nprojecting far from this side; coloured red.—_Farallon de Medinilla_,\r\nappears so regularly and closely fringed in Freycinet’s charts, that I\r\nhave ventured to colour it red, although nothing is said about reefs in\r\nthe “Hydrographical Memoir.” The several islands which form the\r\nnorthern part of the group are volcanic (with the exception perhaps of\r\nTorres, which resembles in form the madreporitic island of Medinilla),\r\nand appear to be without reefs.—_Mangs_, however, is described (by\r\nFreycinet, page 219, “Hydrog.”) from some Spanish charts, as formed of\r\nsmall islands placed “au milieu des nombreux récifs;” and as these\r\nreefs in the general chart of the group do not project so much as a\r\nmile; and as there is no appearance from a double line, of the\r\nexistence of deep water within, I have ventured, although with much\r\nhesitation, to colour them red. Respecting _Folger_ and _Marshall_\r\nIslands which lie some way east of the Marianas, I can find out\r\nnothing, excepting that they are probably low. Krusenstern says this of\r\nMarshall Island; and Folger Island is written with small letters in\r\nD’Urville’s chart; uncoloured.\r\n\r\nBONIN or ARZOBISPO GROUP.—_Peel Island_  has been examined by Captain\r\nBeechey, to whose kindness I am much indebted for giving me information\r\nregarding it: “At Port Lloyd there is a great deal of coral; and the\r\ninner harbour is entirely formed by coral-reefs, which extend outside\r\nthe port along the coast.” Captain Beechey, in another part of his\r\nletter to me, alludes to the reefs fringing the island in all\r\ndirections; but at the same time it must be observed that the surf\r\nwashes the volcanic rocks of the coast in the greater part of its\r\ncircumference. I do not know whether the other islands of the\r\nArchipelago are fringed; I have coloured Peel Island red.—_Grampus\r\nIsland_ to the eastward, does not appear (Meare’s “Voyage,” page 95) to\r\nhave any reefs, nor does _Rosario Island_ (from Lutké’s chart), which\r\nlies to the westward. Respecting the few other islands in this part of\r\nthe sea, namely the _Sulphur Islands_, with an active volcano, and\r\nthose lying between Bonin and Japan (which are situated near the\r\nextreme limit in latitude, at which reefs are formed), I have not been\r\nable to find any clear account.\r\n\r\nWEST END OF NEW GUINEA.—_Port Dory_. From the charts in the “Voyage of\r\nthe ‘Coquille’,” it would appear that the coast in this part is fringed\r\nby coral-reefs; M. Lesson, however, remarks that the coral is sickly;\r\ncoloured red.—_Waigiou_. A considerable portion of the northern shores\r\nof these islands is seen in the charts (on a large scale) in\r\nFreycinet’s “Atlas” to be fringed by coral-reefs. Forrest (page 21,\r\n“Voyage to New Guinea”) alludes to the coral-reefs lining the heads of\r\nPiapis Bay; and Horsburgh (volume ii., page 599, 4th edition), speaking\r\nof the islands in Dampier Strait, says “sharp coral-rocks line their\r\nshores;” coloured red.—In the sea north of these islands, we have\r\n_Guedes_ (or _Freewill_, or _St. David’s_), which from the chart given\r\nin the 4to edition of Carteret’s “Voyage,” must be an atoll.\r\nKrusenstern says the islets are very low; coloured blue.—_Carteret’s\r\nShoals_, in 2° 53′ N., are described as circular, with stony points\r\nshowing all round, with deeper water in the middle; coloured\r\nblue.—_Aiou;_ the plan of this group, given in the “Atlas of the Voyage\r\nof the ‘Astrolabe’,” shows that it is an atoll; and, from a chart in\r\nForrest’s “Voyage,” it appears that there is twelve fathoms within the\r\ncircular reef; coloured blue.—The S.W. coast of New Guinea appears to\r\nbe low, muddy, and devoid of reefs. The _Arru_, _Timor laut_, and\r\n_Tenimber_ groups have lately been examined by Captain Kolff, the MS.\r\ntranslation of which, by Mr. W. Earl, I have been permitted to read,\r\nthrough the kindness of Captain Washington, R.N. These islands are\r\nmostly rather low, and are surrounded by distant reefs (the Ki Islands,\r\nhowever, are lofty, and, from Mr. Stanley’s survey, appear without\r\nreefs); the sea in some parts is shallow, in others profoundly deep (as\r\nnear Larrat). From the imperfection of the published charts, I have\r\nbeen unable to decide to which class these reefs belong. From the\r\ndistance to which they extend from the land, where the sea is very\r\ndeep, I am strongly inclined to believe they ought to come within the\r\nbarrier class, and be coloured blue; but I have been forced to leave\r\nthem uncoloured.—The last-mentioned groups are connected with the east\r\nend of Ceram by a chain of small islands, of which the small groups of\r\n_Ceram-laut_, _Goram_ and _Keffing_ are surrounded by very extensive\r\nreefs, projecting into deep water, which, as in the last case, I\r\nstrongly suspect belong to the barrier class; but I have not coloured\r\nthem. From the south side of Keffing, the reefs project five miles\r\n(Windsor Earl’s “Sailing Direct. for the Arafura Sea,” page 9).\r\n\r\nCERAM.—In various charts which I have examined, several parts of the\r\ncoast are represented as fringed by reefs.—_Manipa_ Island, between\r\nCeram and Bourou, in an old MS. chart in the Admiralty, is fringed by a\r\nvery irregular reef, partly dry at low water, which I do not doubt is\r\nof coral-formation; both islands coloured red.—_Bourou;_ parts of this\r\nisland appear fringed by coral-reefs, namely, the eastern coast, as\r\nseen in Freycinet’s chart; and _Cajeli Bay_, which is said by Horsburgh\r\n(volume ii., page 630) to be lined by coral-reefs, that stretch out a\r\nlittle way, and have only a few feet water on them. In several charts,\r\nportions of the islands forming the AMBOINA GROUP are fringed by reefs;\r\nfor instance, _Noessa_, _Harenca_, and _Ucaster_, in Freycinet’s\r\ncharts. The above-mentioned islands have been coloured red, although\r\nthe evidence is not very satisfactory.—North of Bourou the parallel\r\nline of the _Xulla Isles_ extends: I have not been able to find out\r\nanything about them, excepting that Horsburgh (volume ii., page 543)\r\nsays that the northern shore is surrounded by a reef at the distance of\r\ntwo or three miles; uncoloured.—_Mysol Group;_ the Kanary Islands are\r\nsaid by Forrest (“Voyage,” page 130) to be divided from each other by\r\ndeep straits, and are lined with coral-rocks; coloured red.—_Guebe_,\r\nlying between Waigiou and Gilolo, is engraved as if fringed; and it is\r\nsaid by Freycinet, that all the soundings under five fathoms were on\r\ncoral; coloured red.—_Gilolo_. In a chart published by Dalrymple, the\r\nnumerous islands on the western, southern (_Batchian_ and the _Strait\r\nof Patientia_), and eastern sides appear fringed by narrow reefs; these\r\nreefs, I suppose, are of coral, for it is said in “Malte Brun” (volume\r\nxii., page 156), “Sur les cotes (of Batchian) comme _dans le plupart_\r\ndes iles de cet archipel, il y a de rocs de medrepores d’une beauté et\r\nd’une variété infinies.” Forrest, also (page 50), says Seland, near\r\nBatchian, is a little island with reefs of coral; coloured red.—_Morty_\r\nIsland (north of Gilolo). Horsburgh (volume ii., page 506) says the\r\nnorthern coast is lined by reefs, projecting one or two miles, and\r\nhaving no soundings close to them; I have left it uncoloured, although,\r\nas in some former cases, it ought probably to be pale blue.—_Celebes_.\r\nThe western and northern coasts appear in the charts to be bold and\r\nwithout reefs. Near the extreme northern point, however, an islet in\r\nthe _Straits of Limbe_, and parts of the adjoining shore, appear to be\r\nfringed: the east side of the bay of _Manado_, has deep water, and is\r\nfringed by sand and coral (“‘Astrol.’ Voyage,” Hydrog. Part, pages\r\n453-4); this extreme point, therefore, I have coloured red.—Of the\r\nislands leading from this point to Magindanao, I have not been able to\r\nfind any account, except of _Serangani_, which appears surrounded by\r\nnarrow reefs; and Forrest (“Voyage,” page 164) speaks of coral on its\r\nshores; I have, therefore, coloured this island red. To the eastward of\r\nthis chain lie several islands; of which I cannot find any account,\r\nexcept of _Karkalang_, which is said by Horsburgh (volume ii., page\r\n504) to be lined by a dangerous reef, projecting several miles from the\r\nnorthern shore; not coloured.\r\n\r\nISLANDS NEAR TIMOR.—The account of the following islands is taken from\r\nCaptain D. Kolff’s “Voyage,” in 1825, translated by Mr. W. Earl, from\r\nthe Dutch.—_Lette_ has “reefs extending along shore at the distance of\r\nhalf a mile from the land.”—_Moa_ has reefs on the S.W. part.—_Lakor_\r\nhas a reef lining its shore; these islands are coloured red.—Still more\r\neastward, _Luan_ has, differently from the last-mentioned islands, an\r\nextensive reef; it is steep outside, and within there is a depth of\r\ntwelve feet; from these facts, it is impossible to decide to which\r\nclass this island belongs.—_Kissa_, off the point of Timor, has its\r\n“shore fronted by a reef, steep too on the outer side, over which small\r\nproahs can go at the time of high water;” coloured red.—_Timor;_ most\r\nof the points, and some considerable spaces of the northern shore, are\r\nseen in Freycinet’s chart to be fringed by coral-reefs; and mention is\r\nmade of them in the accompanying “Hydrog. Memoir;” coloured\r\nred.—_Savu_, S.E. of Timor, appears in Flinders’ chart to be fringed;\r\nbut I have not coloured it, as I do not know that the reefs are of\r\ncoral.— _Sandalwood_ Island has, according to Horsburgh (volume ii.,\r\npage 607), a reef on its southern shore, four miles distant from the\r\nland; as the neighbouring sea is deep, and generally bold, this\r\nprobably is a barrier- reef, but I have not ventured to colour it.\r\n\r\nN.W. COAST OF AUSTRALIA.—It appears, in Captain King’s Sailing\r\nDirections (“Narrative of Survey,” volume ii, pages 325-369), that\r\nthere are many extensive coral-reefs skirting, often at considerable\r\ndistances, the N.W. shores, and encompassing the small adjoining\r\nislets. Deep water, in no instance, is represented in the charts\r\nbetween these reefs and the land; and, therefore, they probably belong\r\nto the fringing class. But as they extend far into the sea, which is\r\ngenerally shallow, even in places where the land seems to be somewhat\r\nprecipitous; I have not coloured them. Houtman’s Abrolhos (latitude 28°\r\nS. on west coast) have lately been surveyed by Captain Wickham (as\r\ndescribed in “Naut. Mag.” 1841, page 511): they lie on the edge of a\r\nsteeply shelving bank, which extends about thirty miles seaward, along\r\nthe whole line of coast. The two southern reefs, or islands, enclose a\r\nlagoon-like space of water, varying in depth from five to fifteen\r\nfathoms, and in one spot with twenty-three fathoms. The greater part of\r\nthe island has been formed on their inland sides, by the accumulation\r\nof fragments of coral; the seaward face consisting of nearly bare\r\nledges of rock. Some of the specimens, brought home by Captain Wickham,\r\ncontained fragments of marine shells, but others did not; and these\r\nclosely resembled a formation at King George’s Sound, principally due\r\nto the action of the wind on calcareous dust, which I shall describe in\r\na forthcoming part. From the extreme irregularity of these reefs with\r\ntheir lagoons, and from their position on a bank, the usual depth of\r\nwhich is only thirty fathoms, I have not ventured to class them with\r\natolls, and hence have left them uncoloured.—_Rowley Shoals_. These lie\r\nsome way from the N.W. coast of Australia: according to Captain King\r\n(“Narrative of Survey,” volume i., page 60), they are of\r\ncoral-formation. They rise abruptly from the sea, and Captain King had\r\nno bottom with 170 fathoms close to them. Three of them are\r\ncrescent-shaped; they are mentioned by Mr. Lyell, on the authority of\r\nCaptain King, with reference to the direction of their open sides. “A\r\nthird oval reef of the same group is entirely submerged” (“Principles\r\nof Geology,” book iii. chapter xviii.); coloured blue.—_Scott’s Reefs_,\r\nlying north of Rowley Shoals, are briefly described by Captain Wickham\r\n(“Naut. Mag.” 1841, page 440): they appear to be of great size, of a\r\ncircular form, and “with smooth water within, forming probably a lagoon\r\nof great extent.” There is a break on the western side, where there\r\nprobably is an entrance: the water is very deep off these reefs;\r\ncoloured blue.\r\n\r\nProceeding westward along the great volcanic chain of the East Indian\r\nArchipelago, _Solor Strait_ is represented in a chart published by\r\nDalrymple from a Dutch MS., as fringed; as are parts of _Flores_, of\r\n_Adenara_, and of _Solor_. Horsburgh speaks of coral growing on these\r\nshores; and therefore I have no doubt that the reefs are of coral, and\r\naccordingly have coloured them red. We hear from Horsburgh (volume ii.,\r\npage 602) that a coral-flat bounds the shores of _Sapy_ Bay. From the\r\nsame authority it appears (page 610) that reefs fringe the island of\r\n_Timor-Young_, on the N. shore of Sumbawa; and, likewise (page 600),\r\nthat _Bally_ town in _Lombock_, is fronted by a reef, stretching along\r\nthe shore at a distance of a hundred fathoms, with channels through it\r\nfor boats; these places, therefore, have been coloured red.—_Bally_\r\nIsland. In a Dutch MS. chart on a large scale of Java, which was\r\nbrought from that island by Dr. Horsfield, who had the kindness to show\r\nit me at the India House, its western, northern, and southern shores\r\nappear very regularly fringed by a reef (see also Horsburgh, volume\r\nii., page 593); and as coral is found abundantly there, I have not the\r\nleast doubt that the reef is of coral, and therefore have coloured it\r\nred.\r\n\r\nJAVA.—My information regarding the reefs of this great island is\r\nderived from the chart just mentioned. The greater part of _Madura_ is\r\nrepresented in it as regularly fringed, and likewise portions of the\r\ncoast of Java immediately south of it. Dr. Horsfield informs me that\r\ncoral is very abundant near _Sourabaya_. The islets and parts of the N.\r\ncoast of Java, west of _Point Buang_, or _Japara_, are fringed by\r\nreefs, said to be of coral. _Lubeck_, or _Bavian_ Islands, lying at\r\nsome distance from the shore of Java, are regularly fringed by\r\ncoral-reefs. _Carimon Java_ appears equally so, though it is not\r\ndirectly said that the reefs are of coral; there is a depth between\r\nthirty and forty fathoms round these islands. Parts of the shores of\r\n_Sunda_ Strait, where the water is from forty to eighty fathoms deep,\r\nand the islets near _Batavia_ appear in several charts to be fringed.\r\nIn the Dutch chart the southern shore, in the narrowest part of the\r\nisland, is in two places fringed by reefs of coral. West of\r\n_Segorrowodee_ Bay, and the extreme S.E. and E. portions are likewise\r\nfringed by coral-reefs; all the above-mentioned places coloured red.\r\n\r\n_Macassar Strait_; the east coast of _Borneo_ appears, in most parts,\r\nfree from reefs, and where they occur, as on the east coast of\r\n_Pamaroong_, the sea is very shallow; hence no part is coloured. In\r\n_Macassar_ Strait itself, in about latitude 2° S., there are many small\r\nislands with coral-shoals projecting far from them. There are also (old\r\ncharts by Dalrymple) numerous little flats of coral, not rising to the\r\nsurface of the water, and shelving suddenly from five fathoms to no\r\nbottom with fifty fathoms; they do not appear to have a lagoon-like\r\nstructure. There are similar coral-shoals a little farther south; and\r\nin latitude 4° 55′ there are two, which are engraved from modern\r\nsurveys, in a manner which might represent an annular reef with deep\r\nwater inside: Captain Moresby, however, who was formerly in this sea,\r\ndoubts this fact, so that I have left them uncoloured: at the same time\r\nI may remark, that these two shoals make a nearer approach to the\r\natoll-like structure than any other within the E. Indian Archipelago.\r\nSouthward of these shoals there are other low islands and irregular\r\ncoral-reefs; and in the space of sea, north of the great volcanic\r\nchain, from Timor to Java, we have also other islands, such as the\r\n_Postillions_, _Kalatoa_, _Tokan-Bessees_, &c., which are chiefly low,\r\nand are surrounded by very irregular and distant reefs. From the\r\nimperfect charts I have seen, I have not been able to decide whether\r\nthey belong to the atoll or barrier-classes, or whether they merely\r\nfringe submarine banks, and gently sloping land. In the Bay of _Bonin_,\r\nbetween the two southern arms of Celebes, there are numerous coral-\r\nreefs; but none of them seem to have an atoll-like structure. I have,\r\ntherefore, not coloured any of the islands in this part of the sea; I\r\nthink it, however, exceedingly probable that some of them ought to be\r\nblue. I may add that there is a harbour on the S.E. coast of _Bouton_\r\nwhich, according to an old chart, is formed by a reef, parallel to the\r\nshore, with deep water within; and in the “Voyage of the ‘Coquille’,”\r\nsome neighbouring islands are represented with reefs a good way\r\ndistant, but I do not know whether with deep water within. I have not\r\nthought the evidence sufficient to permit me to colour them.\r\n\r\nSUMATRA.—Commencing with the west coast and outlying islands, _Engano\r\nIsland_ is represented in the published chart as surrounded by a narrow\r\nreef, and Napier, in his “Sailing Directions,” speaks of the reef being\r\nof coral (also Horsburgh, volume ii., page 115); coloured red.—_Rat\r\nIsland_ (3° 51′ S.) is surrounded by reefs of coral, partly dry at low\r\nwater, (Horsburgh, volume ii., page 96).—_Trieste Island_ (4° 2′ S.).\r\nThe shore is represented in a chart which I saw at the India House, as\r\nfringed in such a manner, that I feel sure the fringe consists of\r\ncoral; but as the island is so low, that the sea sometimes flows quite\r\nover it (Dampier, “Voyage,” volume i., page 474), I have not coloured\r\nit.—_Pulo Dooa_ (latitude 3°). In an old chart it is said there are\r\nchasms in the reefs round the island, admitting boats to the\r\nwatering-place, and that the southern islet consists of a mass of sand\r\nand coral.—_Pulo Pisang;_ Horsburgh (volume ii., page 86) says that the\r\nrocky coral-bank, which stretches about forty yards from the shore, is\r\nsteep to all round: in a chart, also, which I have seen, the island is\r\nrepresented as regularly fringed.—_Pulo Mintao_ is lined with reefs on\r\nits west side (Horsburgh, volume ii., page 107).—_Pulo Baniak;_ the\r\nsame authority (volume ii., page 105), speaking of a part, says it is\r\nfaced with coral-rocks.—_Minguin_ (3° 36′ N.). A coral-reef fronts this\r\nplace, and projects into the sea nearly a quarter of a mile (“Notices\r\nof the Indian Arch.” published at Singapore, page 105).—_Pulo Brassa_\r\n(5° 46′ N.). A reef surrounds it at a cable’s length (Horsburgh, volume\r\nii., page 60). I have coloured all the above-specified points red. I\r\nmay here add, that both Horsburgh and Mr. Moor (in the “Notices” just\r\nalluded to) frequently speak of the numerous reefs and banks of coral\r\non the west coast of Sumatra; but these nowhere have the structure of a\r\nbarrier-reef, and Marsden (“History of Sumatra”) states, that where the\r\ncoast is flat, the fringing-reefs extend furthest from it. The northern\r\nand southern points, and the greater part of the east coast, are low,\r\nand faced with mud banks, and therefore without coral.\r\n\r\nNICOBAR ISLANDS.—The chart represents the islands of this group as\r\nfringed by reefs. With regard to _Great Nicobar_, Captain Moresby\r\ninforms me, that it is fringed by reefs of coral, extending between two\r\nand three hundred yards from the shore. The _Northern Nicobars_ appear\r\nso regularly fringed in the published charts, that I have no doubt the\r\nreefs are of coral. This group, therefore, is coloured red.\r\n\r\nANDAMAN ISLANDS.—From an examination of the MS. chart, on a large\r\nscale, of this island, by Captain Arch. Blair, in the Admiralty,\r\nseveral portions of the coast appear fringed; and as Horsburgh speaks\r\nof coral-reefs being numerous in the vicinity of these islands, I\r\nshould have coloured them red, had not some expressions in a paper in\r\nthe “Asiatic Researches” (volume iv., page 402) led me to doubt the\r\nexistence of reefs; uncoloured.\r\n\r\nThe coast of _Malacca_, _Tenasserim_ and the coasts northward, appear\r\nin the greater part to be low and muddy: where reefs occur, as in parts\r\nof _Malacca Straits_, and near _Singapore_, they are of the fringing\r\nkind; but the water is so shoal, that I have not coloured them. In the\r\nsea, however, between Malacca and the west coast of Borneo, where there\r\nis a greater depth from forty to fifty fathoms, I have coloured red\r\nsome of the groups, which are regularly fringed. The northern _Natunas_\r\nand the _Anambas_ Islands are represented in the charts on a large\r\nscale, published in the “Atlas of the Voyage of the ‘Favourite’,” as\r\nfringed by reefs of coral, with very shoal water within\r\nthem.—_Tumbelan_ and _Bunoa_ Islands (1° N.) are represented in the\r\nEnglish charts as surrounded by a very regular fringe.— _St. Barbes_\r\n(0° 15′ N.) is said by Horsburgh (volume ii., page 279) to be fronted\r\nby a reef, over which boats can land only at high water.—The shore of\r\n_Borneo_ at _Tunjong Apee_ is also fronted by a reef, extending not far\r\nfrom the land (Horsburgh, volume ii., page 468). These places I have\r\ncoloured red; although with some hesitation, as the water is shallow. I\r\nmight perhaps have added _Pulo Leat_, in Gaspar Strait, _Lucepara_, and\r\n_Carimata;_ but as the sea is confined and shallow, and the reefs not\r\nvery regular, I have left them uncoloured.\r\n\r\nThe water shoals gradually towards the whole west coast of _Borneo:_ I\r\ncannot make out that it has any reefs of coral. The islands, however,\r\noff the northern extremity, and near the S.W. end of _Palawan_, are\r\nfringed by very distant coral-reefs; thus the reefs in the case of\r\n_Balabac_ are no less than five miles from the land; but the sea, in\r\nthe whole of this district, is so shallow, that the reefs might be\r\nexpected to extend very far from the land. I have not, therefore,\r\nthought myself authorised to colour them. The N.E. point of Borneo,\r\nwhere the water is very shoal, is connected with Magindanao by a chain\r\nof islands called the _Sooloo Archipelago_, about which I have been\r\nable to obtain very little information; _Pangootaran_, although ten\r\nmiles long, entirely consists of a bed of coral-rock (“Notices of E.\r\nIndian Arch.” page 58): I believe from Horsburgh that the island is\r\nlow; not coloured.—_Tahow Bank_, in some old charts, appears like a\r\nsubmerged atoll; not coloured. Forrest (“Voyage,” page 21) states that\r\none of the islands near Sooloo is surrounded by coral-rocks; but there\r\nis no distant reef. Near the S. end of _Basselan_, some of the islets\r\nin the chart accompanying Forrest’s “Voyage,” appear fringed with\r\nreefs; hence I have coloured, though unwillingly, parts of the Sooloo\r\ngroup red. The sea between Sooloo and Palawan, near the shoal coast of\r\nBorneo, is interspersed with irregular reefs and shoal patches; not\r\ncoloured: but in the northern part of this sea, there are two low\r\nislets, _Cagayanes_ and _Cavilli_, surrounded by extensive coral-reefs;\r\nthe breakers round the latter (Horsburgh, volume ii., page 513) extend\r\nfive or six miles from a sandbank, which forms the only dry part; these\r\nbreakers are steep to outside; there appears to be an opening through\r\nthem on one side, with four or five fathoms within: from this\r\ndescription, I strongly suspect that Cavilli ought to be considered an\r\natoll; but, as I have not seen any chart of it, on even a moderately\r\nlarge scale, I have not coloured it. The islets off the northern end of\r\n_Palawan_, are in the same case as those off the southern end, namely\r\nthey are fringed by reefs, some way distant from the shore, but the\r\nwater is exceedingly shallow; uncoloured. The western shore of Palawan\r\nwill be treated of under the head of China Sea.\r\n\r\nPHILIPPINE ARCHIPELAGO.—A chart on a large scale of _Appoo shoal_,\r\nwhich lies near the S.E. coast of Mindoro, has been executed by Captain\r\nD. Ross: it appears atoll-formed, but with rather an irregular outline;\r\nits diameter is about ten miles; there are two well-defined passages\r\nleading into the interior lagoon, which appears open; close outside the\r\nreef all round, there is no bottom with seventy fathoms; coloured\r\nblue.—_Mindoro:_ the N.W. coast is represented in several charts, as\r\nfringed by a reef, and _Luban Island_ is said, by Horsburgh (volume\r\nii., page 436), to be “lined by a reef.”—_Luzon:_ Mr. Cuming, who has\r\nlately investigated with so much success the Natural History of the\r\nPhilippines, informs me, that about three miles of the shore north of\r\nPoint St. Jago, is fringed by a reef; as are (Horsburgh, volume ii.,\r\npage 437) the Three Friars off Silanguin Bay. Between Point Capones and\r\nPlaya Honda, the coast is “lined by a coral-reef, stretching out nearly\r\na mile in some places,” (Horsburgh); and Mr. Cuming visited some\r\nfringing- reefs on parts of this coast, namely, near Puebla, Iba, and\r\nMansinglor. In the neighbourhood of Solon-solon Bay, the shore is lined\r\n(Horsburgh ii., page 439) by coral-reefs, stretching out a great way:\r\nthere are also reefs about the islets off Solamague; and as I am\r\ninformed by Mr. Cuming, near St. Catalina, and a little north of it.\r\nThe same gentleman informs me there are reefs on the S.E. point of this\r\nisland in front of Samar, extending from Malalabon to Bulusan. These\r\nappear to be the principal fringing-reefs on the coasts of Luzon; and\r\nthey have all been coloured red. Mr. Cuming informs me that none of\r\nthem have deep water within; although it appears from Horsburgh that\r\nsome few extend to a considerable distance from the shore. Within the\r\nPhilippine Archipelago, the shores of the islands do not appear to be\r\ncommonly fringed, with the exception of the S. shore of _Masbate_, and\r\nnearly the whole of _Bohol;_ which are both coloured red. On the S.\r\nshore of _Magindanao_, Bunwoot Island is surrounded (according to\r\nForrest, “Voyage,” page 253), by a coral-reef, which in the chart\r\nappears one of the fringing class. With respect to the eastern coasts\r\nof the whole Archipelago, I have not been able to obtain any account.\r\n\r\nBABUYAN ISLANDS.—Horsburgh says (volume ii., page 442), coral-reefs\r\nline the shores of the harbour in Fuga; and the charts show there are\r\nother reefs about these islands. _Camiguin_ has its shore in parts\r\nlined by coral-rock (Horsburgh, page 443); about a mile off shore there\r\nis between thirty and thirty-five fathoms. The plan of Port San Pio\r\nQuinto shows that its shores are fringed with coral; coloured\r\nred.—BABUYAN ISLANDS: Horsburgh, speaking of the southern part of the\r\ngroup (volume ii., page 445) says the shores of both islands are\r\nfortified by a reef, and through some of the gaps in it, the natives\r\ncan pass in their boats in fine weather; the bottom near the land is\r\ncoral-rock. From the published charts, it is evident that several of\r\nthese islands are most regularly fringed; coloured red. The northern\r\nislands are left uncoloured, as I have been unable to find any account\r\nof them.—FORMOSA. The shores, especially the western one, seem chiefly\r\ncomposed of mud and sand, and I cannot make out that they are anywhere\r\nlined by reefs; except in a harbour (Horsburgh, volume ii., page 449)\r\nat the extreme northern point: hence, of course, the whole of this\r\nisland is left uncoloured. The small adjoining islands are in the same\r\ncase.— PATCHOW, or MADJIKO-SIMA GROUPS. _Patchuson_ has been described\r\nby Captain Broughton (“Voy. to the N. Pacific,” page 191); he says, the\r\nboats, with some difficulty, found a passage through the coral-reefs,\r\nwhich extend along the coast, nearly half a mile off it. The boats were\r\nwell sheltered within the reef; but it does not appear that the water\r\nis deep there. Outside the reef the depth is very irregular, varying\r\nfrom five to fifty fathoms; the form of the land is not very abrupt;\r\ncoloured red.—_Taypin-san;_ from the description given (page 195) by\r\nthe same author, it appears that a very irregular reef extends, to the\r\ndistance of several miles, from the southern island; but whether it\r\nencircles a space of deep water is not evident; nor, indeed, whether\r\nthese outlying reefs are connected with those more immediately\r\nadjoining the land; left uncoloured. I may here just add that the shore\r\nof _Kumi_ (lying west of Patchow), has a narrow reef attached to it in\r\nthe plan of it, in La Peyrouse’s “Atlas;” but it does not appear in the\r\naccount of the voyage that it is of coral; uncoloured.—LOO CHOO. The\r\ngreater part of the coast of this moderately hilly island, is skirted\r\nby reefs, which do not extend far from the shore, and which do not\r\nleave a channel of deep water within them, as may be seen in the charts\r\naccompanying Captain B. Hall’s voyage to Loo Choo (see also remarks in\r\nAppendix, pages xxi. and xxv.). There are, however, some ports with\r\ndeep water, formed by reefs in front of valleys, in the same manner as\r\nhappens at Mauritius. Captain Beechey, in a letter to me, compares\r\nthese reefs with those encircling the Society Islands; but there\r\nappears to me a marked difference between them, in the less distance at\r\nwhich the Loo Choo reefs lie from the land with relation to the\r\nprobable submarine inclination, and in the absence of an interior deep\r\nwater-moat or channel, parallel to the land. Hence, I have classed\r\nthese reefs with fringing-reefs, and coloured them red.—PESCADORES\r\n(west of Formosa). Dampier (volume i., page 416), has compared the\r\nappearance of the land to the southern parts of England. The islands\r\nare interlaced with coral-reefs; but as the water is very shoal, and as\r\nspits of sand and gravel (Horsburgh, volume ii., page 450) extend far\r\nout from them, it is impossible to draw any inferences regarding the\r\nnature of the reefs.\r\n\r\nCHINA SEA.—Proceeding from north to south, we first meet the _Pratas\r\nShoal_ (latitude 20° N.) which, according to Horsburgh (volume ii.,\r\npage 335), is composed of coral, is of a circular form, and has a low\r\nislet on it. The reef is on a level with the water’s edge, and when the\r\nsea runs high, there are breakers mostly all round, “but the water\r\nwithin seems pretty deep in some places; although steep-to in most\r\nparts outside, there appear to be several parts where a ship might find\r\nanchorage outside the breakers;” coloured blue.—The _Paracells_ have\r\nbeen accurately surveyed by Captain D. Ross, and charts on a large\r\nscale published: but few low islets have been formed on these shoals,\r\nand this seems to be a general circumstance in the China Sea; the sea\r\nclose outside the reefs is very deep; several of them have a\r\nlagoon-like structure; or separate islets (_Prattle_, _Robert_,\r\n_Drummond_, etc.) are so arranged round a moderately shallow space, as\r\nto appear as if they had once formed one large atoll.— _Bombay Shoal_\r\n(one of the Paracells) has the form of an annular reef, and is\r\n“apparently deep within;” it seems to have an entrance (Horsburgh,\r\nvolume ii., page 332) on its west side; it is very steep\r\noutside.—_Discovery Shoal_, also is of an oval form, with a lagoon-like\r\nspace within, and three openings leading into it, in which there is a\r\ndepth from two to twenty fathoms. Outside, at the distance (Horsburgh,\r\nvolume ii., page 333) of only twenty yards from the reef, soundings\r\ncould not be obtained. The Paracells are coloured blue.—_Macclesfield\r\nBank:_ this is a coral-bank of great size, lying east of the Paracells;\r\nsome parts of the bank are level, with a sandy bottom, but, generally,\r\nthe depth is very irregular. It is intersected by deep cuts or\r\nchannels. I am not able to perceive in the published charts (its\r\nlimits, however, are not very accurately known) whether the central\r\npart is deeper, which I suspect is the case, as in the Great Chagos\r\nBank, in the Indian Ocean; not coloured.—_Scarborough Shoal:_ this\r\ncoral-shoal is engraved with a double row of crosses, forming a circle,\r\nas if there was deep water within the reef: close outside there was no\r\nbottom, with a hundred fathoms; coloured blue.—The sea off the west\r\ncoast of Palawan and the northern part of Borneo is strewed with\r\nshoals: _Swallow Shoal_, according to Horsburgh (volume ii., page 431)\r\n“is formed, _like most_ of the shoals hereabouts, of a belt of\r\ncoral-rocks, “with a basin of deep water within.”—_Half-Moon Shoal_ has\r\na similar structure; Captain D. Ross describes it, as a narrow belt of\r\ncoral-rock, “with a basin of deep water in the centre,” and deep sea\r\nclose outside.—_Bombay Shoal_ appears (Horsburgh, volume ii., page 432)\r\n“to be a basin of smooth water surrounded by breakers.” These three\r\nshoals I have coloured blue.—The _Paraquas Shoals_ are of a circular\r\nform, with deep gaps running through them; not coloured.—A bank\r\ngradually shoaling to the depth of thirty fathoms, extends to a\r\ndistance of about twenty miles from the northern part of _Borneo_, and\r\nto thirty miles from the northern part of _Palawan_. Near the land this\r\nbank appears tolerably free from danger, but a little further out it is\r\nthickly studded with coral-shoals, which do not generally rise quite to\r\nthe surface; some of them are very steep-to, and others have a fringe\r\nof shoal-water round them. I should have thought that these shoals had\r\nlevel surfaces, had it not been for the statement made by Horsburgh\r\n“that most of the shoals hereabouts are formed of a belt of coral.”\r\nBut, perhaps that expression was more particularly applied to the\r\nshoals further in the offing. If these reefs of coral have a\r\nlagoon-like structure, they should have been coloured blue, and they\r\nwould have formed an imperfect barrier in front of Palawan and the\r\nnorthern part of Borneo. But, as the water is not very deep, these\r\nreefs may have grown up from inequalities on the bank: I have not\r\ncoloured them.—The coast of _China_, _Tonquin_, and _Cochin-China_,\r\nforming the western boundary of the China Sea, appear to be without\r\nreefs: with regard to the two last-mentioned coasts, I speak after\r\nexamining the charts on a large scale in the “Atlas of the Voyage of\r\nthe ‘Favourite’.”\r\n\r\nINDIAN OCEAN.—_South Keeling_ has been specially described: nine miles\r\nnorth of it lies North Keeling, a very small atoll, surveyed by the\r\n“Beagle,” the lagoon of which is dry at low water.—_Christmas Island_,\r\nlying to the east, is a high island, without, as I have been informed\r\nby a person who passed it, any reefs at all.—CEYLON: a space about\r\neighty miles in length of the south-western and southern shores of\r\nthese islands has been described by Mr. Twynam (“Naut. Mag.” 1836,\r\npages 365 and 518); parts of this space appear to be very regularly\r\nfringed by coral-reefs, which extend from a quarter to half a mile from\r\nthe shore. These reefs are in places breached, and afford safe\r\nanchorage for the small trading craft. Outside, the sea gradually\r\ndeepens; there is forty fathoms about six miles off shore: this part I\r\nhave coloured red. In the published charts of Ceylon there appear to be\r\nfringing-reefs in several parts of the south-eastern shores, which I\r\nhave also coloured red.—At Venloos Bay the shore is likewise fringed.\r\nNorth of Trincomalee there are also reefs of the same kind. The sea off\r\nthe northern part of Ceylon is exceedingly shallow; and therefore I\r\nhave not coloured the reefs which fringe portions of its shores, and\r\nthe adjoining islets, as well as the Indian promontory of _Madura_.\r\n\r\nCHAGOS, MALDIVA, and LACCADIVE ARCHIPELAGOES.—These three great groups\r\nwhich have already been often noticed, are now well-known from the\r\nadmirable surveys of Captain Moresby and Lieutenant Powell. The\r\npublished charts, which are worthy of the most attentive examination,\r\nat once show that the _Chagos_ and _Maldiva_ groups are entirely formed\r\nof great atolls, or lagoon-formed reefs, surmounted by islets. In the\r\n_Laccadive_ group, this structure is less evident; the islets are low,\r\nnot exceeding the usual height of coral-formations (see Lieutenant\r\nWood’s account, “Geographical Journal”, volume vi., page 29), and most\r\nof the reefs are circular, as may be seen in the published charts; and\r\nwithin several of them, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, there is\r\ndeepish water; these, therefore, have been coloured blue. Directly\r\nnorth, and almost forming part of this group, there is a long, narrow,\r\nslightly curved bank, rising out of the depths of the ocean, composed\r\nof sand, shells, and decayed coral, with from twenty-three to thirty\r\nfathoms on it. I have no doubt that it has had the same origin with the\r\nother Laccadive banks; but as it does not deepen towards the centre I\r\nhave not coloured it. I might have referred to other authorities\r\nregarding these three archipelagoes; but after the publication of the\r\ncharts by Captain Moresby, to whose personal kindness in giving me much\r\ninformation I am exceedingly indebted, it would have been superfluous.\r\n\r\n_Sahia de Malha_bank consists of a series of narrow banks, with from\r\neight to sixteen fathoms on them; they are arranged in a semicircular\r\nmanner, round a space about forty fathoms deep, which slopes on the\r\nS.E. quarter to unfathomable depths; they are steep-to on both sides,\r\nbut more especially on the ocean-side. Hence this bank closely\r\nresembles in structure, and I may add from Captain Moresby’s\r\ninformation in composition, the Pitt’s Bank in the Chagos group; and\r\nthe Pitt’s Bank, must, after what has been shown of the Great Chagos\r\nBank, be considered as a sunken, half-destroyed atoll; hence coloured\r\nblue.—_Cargados Carajos Bank_. Its southern portion consists of a\r\nlarge, curved, coral-shoal, with some low islets on its eastern edge,\r\nand likewise some on the western side, between which there is a depth\r\nof about twelve fathoms. Northward, a great bank extends. I cannot\r\n(probably owing to the want of perfect charts) refer this reef and bank\r\nto any class;—therefore not coloured.—_Ile de Sable_ is a little\r\nisland, lying west of C. Carajos, only some toises in height (“Voyage\r\nof the ‘Favourite’,” volume i., page 130); it is surrounded by reefs;\r\nbut its structure is unintelligible to me. There are some small banks\r\nnorth of it, of which I can find no clear account.—_Mauritius_. The\r\nreefs round this island have been described in the chapter on\r\nfringing-reefs; coloured red. —_Rodriguez_. The coral-reefs here are\r\nexceedingly extensive; in one part they project even five miles from\r\nthe shore. As far as I can make out, there is no deep-water moat within\r\nthem; and the sea outside does not deepen very suddenly. The outline,\r\nhowever, of the land appears to be (“Life of Sir J. Makintosh,” volume\r\nii., page 165) hilly and rugged. I am unable to decide whether these\r\nreefs belong to the barrier class; as seems probable from their great\r\nextension, or to the fringing class; uncoloured. —_Bourbon_. The\r\ngreater part of the shores of this island are without reefs; but\r\nCaptain Carmichael (Hooker’s “Bot. Misc.”) states that a portion,\r\nfifteen miles in length, on the S.E. side, is imperfectly fringed with\r\ncoral reefs: I have not thought this sufficient to colour the island.\r\n\r\nSEYCHELLES.—The rocky islands of primary formation, composing this\r\ngroup, rise from a very extensive and tolerably level bank, having a\r\ndepth between twenty and forty fathoms. In Captain Owen’s chart, and in\r\nthat in the “Atlas of the Voyage of the ‘Favourite’,” it appears that\r\nthe east side of _Mahé_ and the adjoining islands of _St. Anne_ and\r\n_Cerf_, are regularly fringed by coral-reefs. A portion of the S.E.\r\npart of _Curieuse Island_, the N., and part of the S.W. shore of\r\n_Praslin Island_, and the whole west side of _Digue Island_, appear\r\nfringed. From a MS. account of these islands by Captain F. Moresby, in\r\nthe Admiralty, it appears that _Silhouette_ is also fringed; he states\r\nthat all these islands are formed of granite and quartz, that they rise\r\nabruptly from the sea, and that “coral-reefs have grown round them, and\r\nproject for some distance.” Dr. Allan, of Forres, who visited these\r\nislands, informs me that there is no deep water between the reefs and\r\nthe shore. The above specified points have been coloured red.\r\n_Amirantes Islands:_ The small islands of this neighbouring group,\r\naccording to the MS. account of them by Captain F. Moresby, are\r\nsituated on an extensive bank; they consist of the debris of corals and\r\nshells; are only about twenty feet in height, and are environed by\r\nreefs, some attached to the shore, and some rather distant from it.—I\r\nhave taken great pains to procure plans and information regarding the\r\nseveral islands lying between S.E. and S.W. of the Amirantes, and the\r\nSeychelles; relying chiefly on Captain F. Moresby and Dr. Allan, it\r\nappears that the greater number, namely—_Platte_, _Alphonse_,\r\n_Coetivi_, _Galega_, _Providence_, _St. Pierre_, _Astova_,\r\n_Assomption_, and _Glorioso_, are low, formed of sand or coral-rock,\r\nand irregularly shaped; they are situated on very extensive banks, and\r\nare connected with great coral-reefs. Galega is said by Dr. Allan, to\r\nbe rather higher than the other islands; and St. Pierre is described by\r\nCaptain F. Moresby, as being cavernous throughout, and as not\r\nconsisting of either limestone or granite. These islands, as well as\r\nthe Amirantes, certainly are not atoll-formed, and they differ as a\r\ngroup from every other group with which I am acquainted; I have not\r\ncoloured them; but probably the reefs belong to the fringing class.\r\nTheir formation is attributed, both by Dr. Allan and Captain F.\r\nMoresby, to the action of the currents, here exceedingly violent, on\r\nbanks, which no doubt have had an independent geological origin. They\r\nresemble in many respects some islands and banks in the West Indies,\r\nwhich owe their origin to a similar agency, in conjunction with an\r\nelevation of the entire area. In close vicinity to the several islands,\r\nthere are three others of an apparently different nature: first, _Juan\r\nde Nova_, which appears from some plans and accounts to be an atoll;\r\nbut from others does not appear to be so; not coloured. Secondly\r\n_Cosmoledo;_ “this group consists of a ring of coral, ten leagues in\r\ncircumference, and a quarter of a mile broad in some places, enclosing\r\na magnificent lagoon, into which there did not appear a single opening”\r\n(Horsburgh, volume i., page 151); coloured blue. Thirdly, _Aldabra;_ it\r\nconsists of three islets, about twenty-five feet in height, with red\r\ncliffs (Horsburgh, volume i., page 176) surrounding a very shallow\r\nbasin or lagoon. The sea is profoundly deep close to the shore. Viewing\r\nthis island in a chart, it would be thought an atoll; but the foregoing\r\ndescription shows that there is something different in its nature; Dr.\r\nAllan also states that it is cavernous, and that the coral-rock has a\r\nvitrified appearance. Is it an upheaved atoll, or the crater of a\r\nvolcano?—uncoloured.\r\n\r\nCOMORO GROUP.—_Mayotta_, according to Horsburgh (volume i., page 216,\r\n4th edition), is completely surrounded by a reef, which runs at the\r\ndistance of three, four, and in some places even five miles from the\r\nland; in an old chart, published by Dalrymple, a depth in many places\r\nof thirty-six and thirty-eight fathoms is laid down within the reef. In\r\nthe same chart, the space of open water within the reef in some parts\r\nis even more than three miles wide: the land is bold and peaked; this\r\nisland, therefore, is encircled by a well-characterised barrier-reef,\r\nand is coloured pale blue.—_Johanna;_ Horsburgh says (volume I. page\r\n217) this island from the N.W. to the S.W. point, is bounded by a reef,\r\nat the distance of two miles from the shore; in some parts, however,\r\nthe reef must be attached, since Lieutenant Boteler (“Narr.” volume i.,\r\npage 161) describes a passage through it, within which there is room\r\nonly for a few boats. Its height, as I am informed by Dr. Allan, is\r\nabout 3,500 feet; it is very precipitous, and is composed of granite,\r\ngreenstone, and quartz; coloured blue.—_Mohilla;_ on the S. side of\r\nthis island there is anchorage, in from thirty to forty-five fathoms,\r\nbetween a reef and the shore (Horsburgh, volume i., page 214); in\r\nCaptain Owen’s chart of Madagascar, this island is represented as\r\nencircled; coloured blue.—_Great Comoro Island_ is, as I am informed by\r\nDr. Allan, about 8,000 feet high, and apparently volcanic; it is not\r\nregularly encircled; but reefs of various shapes and dimensions, jut\r\nout from every headland on the W., S., and S.E. coasts, inside of which\r\nreefs there are channels, often parallel with the shore, with deep\r\nwater. On the north-western coasts the reefs appear attached to the\r\nshores. The land near the coast is in some places bold, but generally\r\nspeaking it is flat; Horsburgh says (volume i., page 214) the water is\r\nprofoundly deep close to the _shore_, from which expression I presume\r\nsome parts are without reefs. From this description I apprehend the\r\nreef belongs to the barrier class; but I have not coloured it, as most\r\nof the charts which I have seen, represent the reefs round it as very\r\nmuch less extensive than round the other islands in the group.\r\n\r\nMADAGASCAR.—My information is chiefly derived from the published charts\r\nby Captain Owen, and the accounts given by him and by Lieutenant\r\nBoteler. Commencing at the S.W. extremity of the island; towards the\r\nnorthern part of the _Star Bank_ (in latitude 25° S.) the coast for ten\r\nmiles is fringed by a reef; coloured red. The shore immediately S. of\r\n_St. Augustine’s Bay_ appears fringed; but _Tullear_ Harbour, directly\r\nN. of it, is formed by a narrow reef ten miles long, extending parallel\r\nto the shore, with from four to ten fathoms within it. If this reef had\r\nbeen more extensive, it must have been classed as a barrier-reef; but\r\nas the line of coast falls inwards here, a submarine bank perhaps\r\nextends parallel to the shore, which has offered a foundation for the\r\ngrowth of the coral; I have left this part uncoloured. From _lat_. 22°\r\n16′ _to_ 21° 37′, the shore is fringed by coral-reefs (see Lieutenant\r\nBoteler’s “Narrative,” volume ii., page 106), less than a mile in\r\nwidth, and with shallow water within. There are outlying coral-shoals\r\nin several parts of the offing, with about ten fathoms between them and\r\nthe shore, and the depth of the sea one mile and a half seaward, is\r\nabout thirty fathoms. The part above specified is engraved on a large\r\nscale; and as in the charts on rather a smaller scale the same fringe\r\nof reef extends as far as latitude 33° 15′; I have coloured the whole\r\nof this part of the coast red. The islands of _Juan de Nova_ (in\r\nlatitude 17° S.) appear in the charts on a large scale to be fringed,\r\nbut I have not been able to ascertain whether the reefs are of coral;\r\nuncoloured. The main part of the west coast appears to be low, with\r\noutlying sandbanks, which, Lieutenant Boteler (volume ii., page 106)\r\nsays, “are faced on the edge of deep water by a line of sharp-pointed\r\ncoral-rocks.” Nevertheless I have not coloured this part, as I cannot\r\nmake out by the charts that the coast itself is fringed. The headlands\r\nof _Narrenda_ and _Passandava Bays_ (14° 40′) and the islands in front\r\nof _Radama harbour_ are represented in the plans as regularly fringed,\r\nand have accordingly been coloured red. With respect to the _East coast\r\nof Madagascar_, Dr. Allan informs me in a letter, that the whole line\r\nof coast, from _Tamatave_, in 18° 12′, to _C. Amber_, at the extreme\r\nnorthern point of the island, is bordered by coral-reefs. The land is\r\nlow, uneven, and gradually rising from the coast. From Captain Owen’s\r\ncharts, also, the existence of these reefs, which evidently belong to\r\nthe fringing class, on some parts, namely N. of _British Sound_, and\r\nnear _Ngoncy_, of the above line of coast might have been inferred.\r\nLieutenant Boteler (volume i., page 155) speaks of “the reef\r\nsurrounding the island of _St. Mary’s_ at a small distance from the\r\nshore.” In a previous chapter I have described, from the information of\r\nDr. Allan, the manner in which the reefs extend in N.E. lines from the\r\nheadlands on this coast, thus sometimes forming rather deep channels\r\nwithin them, this seems caused by the action of the currents, and the\r\nreefs spring up from the submarine prolongations of the sandy\r\nheadlands. The above specified portion of the coast is coloured red.\r\nThe remaining S.E. portions do not appear in any published chart to\r\npossess reefs of any kind; and the Rev. W. Ellis, whose means of\r\ninformation regarding this side of Madagascar have been extensive,\r\ninforms me he believes there are none.\r\n\r\nEAST COAST OF AFRICA.—Proceeding from the northern part, the coast\r\nappears, for a considerable space, without reefs. My information, I may\r\nhere observe, is derived from the survey by Captain Owen, together with\r\nhis narrative; and that by Lieutenant Boteler. At _Mukdeesha_ (10° 1′\r\nN.) there is a coral-reef extending four or five miles along the shore\r\n(Owen’s “Narr.” volume i, page 357) which in the chart lies at the\r\ndistance of a quarter of a mile from the shore, and has within it from\r\nsix to ten feet water: this then is a fringing-reef, and is coloured\r\nred. From _Juba_, a little S. of the equator, to _Lamoo_ (in 2° 20′ S.)\r\n“the coast and islands are formed of madrepore” (Owen’s “Narrative,”\r\nvolume i., page 363). The chart of this part (entitled _Dundas\r\nIslands_), presents an extraordinary appearance; the coast of the\r\nmainland is quite straight and it is fronted at the average distance of\r\ntwo miles, by exceedingly narrow, straight islets, fringed with reefs.\r\nWithin the chain of islets, there are extensive tidal flats and muddy\r\nbays, into which many rivers enter; the depths of these spaces varies\r\nfrom one to four fathoms—the latter depth not being common, and about\r\ntwelve feet the average. Outside the chain of islets, the sea, at the\r\ndistance of a mile, varies in depth from eight to fifteen fathoms.\r\nLieutenant Boteler (“Narr.” volume i., page 369) describes the muddy\r\nbay of _Patta_, which seems to resemble other parts of this coast, as\r\nfronted by small, narrow, level islets formed of decomposing coral, the\r\nmargin of which is seldom of greater height than twelve feet,\r\noverhanging the rocky surface from which the islets rise. Knowing that\r\nthe islets are formed of coral, it is, I think, scarcely possible to\r\nview the coast, and not at once conclude that we here see a\r\nfringing-reef, which has been upraised a few feet: the unusual depth of\r\nfrom two to four fathoms within some of these islets, is probably due\r\nto muddy rivers having prevented the growth of coral near the shore.\r\nThere is, however, one difficulty on this view, namely, that before the\r\nelevation took place, which converted the reef into a chain of islets,\r\nthe water must apparently have been still deeper; on the other hand it\r\nmay be supposed that the formation of a nearly perfect barrier in\r\nfront, of so large an extent of coast, would cause the currents\r\n(especially in front of the rivers), to deepen their muddy beds. When\r\ndescribing in the chapter on fringing-reefs, those of Mauritius, I have\r\ngiven my reasons for believing that the shoal spaces within reefs of\r\nthis kind, must, in many instances, have been deepened. However this\r\nmay be, as several parts of this line of coast are undoubtedly fringed\r\nby living reefs, I have coloured it red.— _Maleenda_ (3° 20′ S.). In\r\nthe plan of the harbour, the south headland appears fringed; and in\r\nOwen’s chart on a larger scale, the reefs are seen to extend nearly\r\nthirty miles southward; coloured red.—_Mombas_ (4° 5′ S.). The island\r\nwhich forms the harbour, “is surrounded by cliffs of madrepore, capable\r\nof being rendered almost impregnable” (Owen’s “Narr.” volume i., page\r\n412). The shore of the mainland N. and S. of the harbour, is most\r\nregularly fringed by a coral-reef at a distance from half a mile to one\r\nmile and a quarter from the land; within the reef the depth is from\r\nnine to fifteen feet; outside the reef the depth at rather less than\r\nhalf a mile is thirty fathoms. From the charts it appears that a space\r\nabout thirty-six miles in length, is here fringed; coloured\r\nred.—_Pemba_ (5° S.) is an island of coral-formation, level, and about\r\ntwo hundred feet in height (Owen’s “Narr.” volume i., page 425); it is\r\nthirty-five miles long, and is separated from the mainland by a deep\r\nsea. The outer coast is represented in the chart as regularly fringed;\r\ncoloured red. The mainland in front of Pemba is likewise fringed; but\r\nthere also appear to be some outlying reefs with deep water between\r\nthem and the shore. I do not understand their structure, either from\r\nthe charts or the description, therefore have not coloured\r\nthem.—_Zanzibar_ resembles Pemba in most respects; its southern half on\r\nthe western side and the neighbouring islets are fringed; coloured red.\r\nOn the mainland, a little S. of Zanzibar, there are some banks parallel\r\nto the coast, which I should have thought had been formed of coral, had\r\nit not been said (Boteler’s “Narr.” volume ii., page 39) that they were\r\ncomposed of sand; not coloured.—_Latham’s Bank_ is a small island,\r\nfringed by coral-reefs; but being only ten feet high, it has not been\r\ncoloured.—_Monfeea_ is an island of the same character as Pemba; its\r\nouter shore is fringed, and its southern extremity is connected with\r\nKeelwa Point on the mainland by a chain of islands fringed by reefs;\r\ncoloured red. The four last-mentioned islands resemble in many respects\r\nsome of the islands in the Red Sea, which will presently be described.—\r\n_Keelwa_. In a plan of the shore, a space of twenty miles N. and S. of\r\nthis place is fringed by reefs, apparently of coral: these reefs are\r\nprolonged still further southward in Owen’s general chart. The coast in\r\nthe plans of the rivers _Lindy_ and _Monghow_ (9° 59′ and 10° 7′ S.)\r\nhas the same structure; coloured red.—_Querimba Islands_ (from 10° 40′\r\nto 13° S.). A chart on a large scale is given of these islands; they\r\nare low, and of coral-formation (Boteler’s “Narr.” volume ii., page\r\n54); and generally have extensive reefs projecting from them which are\r\ndry at low water, and which on the outside rise abruptly from a deep\r\nsea: on their insides they are separated from the continent by a\r\nchannel, or rather a succession of bays, with an average depth of ten\r\nfathoms. The small headlands on the continent also have coral-banks\r\nattached to them; and the Querimba islands and banks are placed on the\r\nlines of prolongation of these headlands, and are separated from them\r\nby very shallow channels. It is evident that whatever cause, whether\r\nthe drifting of sediment or subterranean movements, produced the\r\nheadlands, likewise produced, as might have been expected, submarine\r\nprolongations to them; and these towards their outer extremities, have\r\nsince afforded a favourable basis for the growth of coral-reefs, and\r\nsubsequently for the formation of islets. As these reefs clearly belong\r\nto the fringing class, the Querimba islands have been coloured\r\nred.—_Monabila_ (13° 32′ S.). In the plan of this harbour, the\r\nheadlands outside are fringed by reefs apparently of coral; coloured\r\nred.—_Mozambique_ (150° S.) The outer part of the island on which the\r\ncity is built, and the neighbouring islands, are fringed by\r\ncoral-reefs; coloured red. From the description given in Owen’s “Narr.”\r\n(volume i., page 162), the shore from _Mozambique_ to _Delagoa Bay_\r\nappears to be low and sandy; many of the shoals and islets off this\r\nline of coast are of coral-formation; but from their small size and\r\nlowness, it is not possible, from the charts, to know whether they are\r\ntruly fringed. Hence this portion of coast is left uncoloured, as are\r\nlikewise those parts more northward, of which no mention has been made\r\nin the foregoing pages from the want of information.\r\n\r\nPERSIAN GULF.—From the charts lately published on a large scale by the\r\nEast India Company, it appears that several parts, especially the\r\nsouthern shores of this gulf, are fringed by coral-reefs; but as the\r\nwater is very shallow, and as there are numerous sandbanks, which are\r\ndifficult to distinguish on the chart from reefs, I have not coloured\r\nthe upper part red. Towards the mouth, however, where the water is\r\nrather deeper, the islands of _Ormuz_ and _Larrack_, appear so\r\nregularly fringed, that I have coloured them red. There are certainly\r\nno atolls in the Persian Gulf. The shores of _Immaum_, and of the\r\npromontory forming the southern headland of the Persian Gulf, seem to\r\nbe without reefs. The whole S.W. part (except one or two small patches)\r\nof _Arabia Felix_, and the shores of _Socotra_ appear from the charts\r\nand memoir of Captain Haines (“Geographical Journal,” 1839, page 125)\r\nto be without any reefs. I believe there are no extensive coral-reefs\r\non any part of the coasts of _India_, except on the low promontory of\r\n_Madura_ (as already mentioned) in front of Ceylon.\r\n\r\nRED SEA.—My information is chiefly derived from the admirable charts\r\npublished by the East India Company in 1836, from personal\r\ncommunication with Captain Moresby, one of the surveyors, and from the\r\nexcellent memoir, “Über die Natur der Corallen-Bänken des Rothen\r\nMeeres,” by Ehrenberg. The plains immediately bordering the Red Sea\r\nseem chiefly to consist of a sedimentary formation of the newer\r\ntertiary period. The shore is, with the exception of a few parts,\r\nfringed by coral-reefs. The water is generally profoundly deep close to\r\nthe shore; but this fact, which has attracted the attention of most\r\nvoyagers, seems to have no necessary connection with the presence of\r\nreefs; for Captain Moresby particularly observed to me, that, in\r\nlatitude 24° 10′ on the eastern side, there is a piece of coast, with\r\nvery deep water close to it, without any reefs, but not differing in\r\nother respects from the usual nature of the coast-line. The most\r\nremarkable feature in the Red Sea is the chain of submerged banks,\r\nreefs, and islands, lying some way from the shore, chiefly on the\r\neastern side; the space within being deep enough to admit a safe\r\nnavigation in small vessels. The banks are generally of an oval form,\r\nand some miles in width; but some of them are very long in proportion\r\nto their width. Captain Moresby informs me that any one, who had not\r\nmade actual plans of them, would be apt to think that they were much\r\nmore elongated than they really are. Many of them rise to the surface,\r\nbut the greater number lie from five to thirty fathoms beneath it, with\r\nirregular soundings on them. They consist of sand and living coral;\r\ncoral on most of them, according to Captain Moresby, covering the\r\ngreater part of their surface. They extend parallel to the shore, and\r\nthey are not unfrequently connected in their middle parts by short\r\ntransverse banks with the mainland. The sea is generally profoundly\r\ndeep quite close to them, as it is near most parts of the coast of the\r\nmainland; but this is not universally the case, for between latitude\r\n15° and 17° the water deepens quite gradually from the banks, both on\r\nthe eastern and western shores, towards the middle of the sea. Islands\r\nin many parts arise from these banks; they are low, flat-topped, and\r\nconsist of the same horizontally stratified formation with that forming\r\nthe plain-like margin of the mainland. Some of the smaller and lower\r\nislands consist of mere sand. Captain Moresby informs me, that small\r\nmasses of rock, the remnants of islands, are left on many banks where\r\nthere is now no dry land. Ehrenberg also asserts that most of the\r\nislets, even the lowest, have a flat abraded basis, composed of the\r\nsame tertiary formation: he believes that as soon as the surf wears\r\ndown the protuberant parts of a bank, just beneath the level of the\r\nsea, the surface becomes protected from further abrasion by the growth\r\nof coral, and he thus accounts for the existence of so many banks\r\nstanding on a level with the surface of this sea. It appears that most\r\nof the islands are certainly decreasing in size.\r\n\r\nThe form of the banks and islands is most singular in the part just\r\nreferred to, namely, from latitude 15° to 17°, where the sea deepens\r\nquite gradually: the _Dhalac_ group, on the western coast, is\r\nsurrounded by an intricate archipelago of islets and shoals; the main\r\nisland is very irregularly shaped, and it includes a bay seven miles\r\nlong, by four across, in which no bottom was found with 252 feet: there\r\nis only one entrance into this bay, half a mile wide, and with an\r\nisland in front of it. The submerged banks on the eastern coast, within\r\nthe same latitudes, round _Farsan_ Island, are, likewise, penetrated by\r\nmany narrow creeks of deep water; one is twelve miles long, in the form\r\nof a hatchet, in which, close to its broad upper end, soundings were\r\nnot struck with 360 feet, and its entrance is only half a mile wide: in\r\nanother creek of the same nature, but even with a more irregular\r\noutline, there was no bottom with 480 feet. The island of Farsan,\r\nitself, has as singular a form as any of its surrounding banks. The\r\nbottom of the sea round the Dhalac and Farsan Islands consists chiefly\r\nof sand and agglutinated fragments, but, in the deep and narrow creeks,\r\nit consists of mud; the islands themselves consist of thin,\r\nhorizontally stratified, modern tertiary beds, containing but little\r\nbroken coral;[2] their shores are fringed by living coral-reefs.\r\n\r\n [2] Rüppell, “Reise in Abyssinie,” Band. i., S. 247.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the account given by Rüppell[3] of the manner in which Dhalac has\r\nbeen rent by fissures, the opposite sides of which have been unequally\r\nelevated (in one instance to the amount of fifty feet), it seems\r\nprobable that its irregular form, as well as probably that of Farsan,\r\nmay have been partly caused by unequal elevations; but, considering the\r\ngeneral form of the banks, and of the deep-water creeks, together with\r\nthe composition of the land, I think their configuration is more\r\nprobably due in great part to strong currents having drifted sediment\r\nover an uneven bottom: it is almost certain that their form cannot be\r\nattributed to the growth of coral. Whatever may have been the precise\r\norigin of the Dhalac and Farsan Archipelagoes, the greater number of\r\nthe banks on the eastern side of the Red Sea seem to have originated\r\nthrough nearly similar means. I judge of this from their similarity in\r\nconfiguration (in proof of which I may instance a bank on the east\r\ncoast in latitude 22°; and although it is true that the northern banks\r\ngenerally have a less complicated outline), and from their similarity\r\nin composition, as may be observed in their upraised portions. The\r\ndepth within the banks northward of latitude 17°, is usually greater,\r\nand their outer sides shelve more abruptly (circumstances which seem to\r\ngo together) than in the Dhalac and Farsan Archipelagoes; but this\r\nmight easily have been caused by a difference in the action of the\r\ncurrents during their formation: moreover, the greater quantity of\r\nliving coral, which, according to Captain Moresby, exists on the\r\nnorthern banks, would tend to give them steeper margins.\r\n\r\n [3] Rüppell, “Reise in Abyssinie,” Band. i., S. 245.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this account, brief and imperfect as it is, we can see that the\r\ngreat chain of banks on the eastern coast, and on the western side in\r\nthe southern portion, differ greatly from true barrier-reefs wholly\r\nformed by the growth of coral. It is indeed the direct conclusion of\r\nEhrenberg (“Uber die,” etc., pages 45 and 51), that they are connected\r\nin their origin quite secondarily with the growth of coral; and he\r\nremarks that the islands off the coast of Norway, if worn down level\r\nwith the sea, and merely coated with living coral, would present a\r\nnearly similar appearance. I cannot, however, avoid suspecting, from\r\ninformation given me by Dr. Malcolmson and Captain Moresby, that\r\nEhrenberg has rather under-rated the influence of corals, in some\r\nplaces at least, on the formation of the tertiary deposits of the Red\r\nSea.\r\n\r\n_The West Coast of the Red Sea between lat._ 19° _and_ 22°.—There are,\r\nin this space, reefs, which, if I had known nothing of those in other\r\nparts of the Red Sea, I should unhesitatingly have considered as\r\nbarrier-reefs; and, after deliberation, I have come to the same\r\nconclusion. One of these reefs, in 20° 15′, is twenty miles long, less\r\nthan a mile in width (but expanding at the northern end into a disc),\r\nslightly sinuous, and extending parallel to the mainland at the\r\ndistance of five miles from it, with very deep water within; in one\r\nspot soundings were not obtained with 205 fathoms. Some leagues further\r\nsouth, there is another linear reef, very narrow, ten miles long, with\r\nother small portions of reef, north and south, almost connected with\r\nit; and within this line of reefs (as well as outside) the water is\r\nprofoundly deep. There are also some small linear and sickle-formed\r\nreefs, lying a little way out at sea. All these reefs are covered, as I\r\nam informed by Captain Moresby, by living corals. Here, then, we have\r\nall the characters of reefs of the barrier class; and in some outlying\r\nreefs we have an approach to the structure of atolls. The source of my\r\ndoubts about the classification of these reefs, arises from having\r\nobserved in the Dhalac and Farsan groups the narrowness and\r\nstraightness of several spits of sand and rock: one of these spits in\r\nthe Dhalac group is nearly fifteen miles long, only two broad, and it\r\nis bordered on each side with deep water; so that, if worn down by the\r\nsurf, and coated with living corals, it would form a reef nearly\r\nsimilar to those within the space under consideration. There is, also,\r\nin this space (latitude 21°) a peninsula, bordered by cliffs, with its\r\nextremity worn down to the level of the sea, and its basis fringed with\r\nreefs: in the line of prolongation of this peninsula, there lies the\r\nisland of _Macowa_ (formed, according to Captain Moresby, of the usual\r\ntertiary deposit), and some smaller islands, large parts of which\r\nlikewise appear to have been worn down, and are now coated with living\r\ncorals. If the removal of the strata in these several cases had been\r\nmore complete, the reefs thus formed would have nearly resembled those\r\nbarrier-like ones now under discussion. Notwithstanding these facts, I\r\ncannot persuade myself that the many very small, isolated, and\r\nsickle-formed reefs and others, long, nearly straight, and very narrow,\r\nwith the water unfathomably deep close round them, could possibly have\r\nbeen formed by corals merely coating banks of sediment, or the abraded\r\nsurfaces of irregularly shaped islands. I feel compelled to believe\r\nthat the foundations of these reefs have subsided, and that the corals,\r\nduring their upward growth, have given to these reefs their present\r\nforms: I may remark that the subsidence of narrow and\r\nirregularly-shaped peninsulas and islands, such as those existing on\r\nthe coasts of the Red Sea, would afford the requisite foundations for\r\nthe reefs in question.\r\n\r\n_The West Coast from lat._ 22° _to_ 24°.—This part of the coast (north\r\nof the space coloured blue on the map) is fronted by an irregularly\r\nshelving bank, from about ten to thirty fathoms deep; numerous little\r\nreefs, some of which have the most singular shapes, rise from this\r\nbank. It may be observed, respecting one of them, in latitude 23° 10′,\r\nthat if the promontory in latitude 24° were worn down to the level of\r\nthe sea, and coated with corals, a very similar and grotesquely formed\r\nreef would be produced. Many of the reefs on this part of the coast may\r\nthus have originated; but there are some sickle, and almost\r\natoll-formed reefs lying in deep water off the promontory in latitude\r\n24°, which lead me to suppose that all these reefs are more probably\r\nallied to the barrier or atoll classes. I have not, however, ventured\r\nto colour this portion of coast.—_On the west coast from lat._ 19° _to_\r\n17° (south of space coloured blue on the map), there are many low\r\nislets of very small dimensions, not much elongated, and rising out of\r\ngreat depths at a distance from the coast; these cannot be classed\r\neither with atolls, or barrier- or fringing-reefs. I may here remark\r\nthat the outlying reefs on the west coast, between latitude 19° and\r\n24°, are the only ones in the Red Sea, which approach in structure to\r\nthe true atolls of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, but they present only\r\nimperfect miniature likenesses of them.\r\n\r\n_Eastern Coast_.—I have felt the greatest doubt about colouring any\r\nportion of this coast, north of the fringing-reefs round the Farsan\r\nIslands in 16° 10′. There are many small outlying coral-reefs along the\r\nwhole line of coast; but as the greater number rise from banks not very\r\ndeeply submerged (the formation of which has been shown to be only\r\nsecondarily connected with the growth of coral), their origin may be\r\ndue simply to the growth of knolls of corals, from an irregular\r\nfoundation situated within a limited depth. But between latitude 18°\r\nand 20°, there are so many linear, elliptic, and extremely small reefs,\r\nrising abruptly out of profound depths, that the same reasons, which\r\nled me to colour blue a portion of the west coast, have induced me to\r\ndo the same in this part. There exist some small outlying reefs rising\r\nfrom deep water, north of latitude 20° (the northern limit coloured\r\nblue), on the east coast; but as they are not very numerous and\r\nscarcely any of them linear, I have thought it right to leave them\r\nuncoloured.\r\n\r\nIn the _southern parts_ of the Red Sea, considerable spaces of the\r\nmainland, and of some of the Dhalac islands, are skirted by reefs,\r\nwhich, as I am informed by Captain Moresby, are of living coral, and\r\nhave all the characters of the fringing class. As in these latitudes,\r\nthere are no outlying linear or sickle-formed reefs, rising out of\r\nunfathomable depths, I have coloured these parts of the coast red. On\r\nsimilar grounds, I have coloured red the _northern parts of the western\r\ncoast_ (north of latitude 24° 30′), and likewise the shores of the\r\nchief part of the _Gulf of Suez_. In the _Gulf of Acaba_, as I am\r\ninformed by Captain Moresby there are no coral-reefs, and the water is\r\nprofoundly deep.\r\n\r\nWEST INDIES.—My information regarding the reefs of this area, is\r\nderived from various sources, and from an examination of numerous\r\ncharts; especially of those lately executed during the survey under\r\nCaptain Owen, R.N. I lay under particular obligation to Captain Bird\r\nAllen, R.N., one of the members of the late survey, for many personal\r\ncommunications on this subject. As in the case of the Red Sea, it is\r\nnecessary to make some preliminary remarks on the submerged banks of\r\nthe West Indies, which are in some degree connected with coral-reefs,\r\nand cause considerable doubts in their classification. That large\r\naccumulations of sediment are in progress on the West Indian shores,\r\nwill be evident to any one who examines the charts of that sea,\r\nespecially of the portion north of a line joining Yucutan and Florida.\r\nThe area of deposition seems less intimately connected with the\r\ndebouchement of the great rivers, than with the course of the\r\nsea-currents; as is evident from the vast extension of the banks from\r\nthe promontories of Yucutan and Mosquito.\r\n\r\nBesides the coast-banks, there are many of various dimensions which\r\nstand quite isolated; these closely resemble each other, they lie from\r\ntwo or three to twenty or thirty fathoms under water, and are composed\r\nof sand, sometimes firmly agglutinated, with little or no coral; their\r\nsurfaces are smooth and nearly level, shelving only to the amount of a\r\nfew fathoms, very gradually all round towards their edges, where they\r\nplunge abruptly into the unfathomable sea. This steep inclination of\r\ntheir sides, which is likewise characteristic of the coast-banks, is\r\nvery remarkable: I may give as an instance, the Misteriosa Bank, on the\r\nedges of which the soundings change in 250 fathoms horizontal distance,\r\nfrom 11 to 210 fathoms; off the northern point of the bank of Old\r\nProvidence, in 200 fathoms horizontal distance, the change is from 19\r\nto 152 fathoms; off the Great Bahama Bank, in 160 fathoms horizontal\r\ndistance, the inclination is in many places from 10 fathoms to no\r\nbottom with 190 fathoms. On coasts in all parts of the world, where\r\nsediment is accumulating, something of this kind may be observed; the\r\nbanks shelve very gently far out to sea, and then terminate abruptly.\r\nThe form and composition of the banks standing in the middle parts of\r\nthe W. Indian Sea, clearly show that their origin must be chiefly\r\nattributed to the accumulation of sediment; and the only obvious\r\nexplanation of their isolated position is the presence of a nucleus,\r\nround which the currents have collected fine drift matter. Any one who\r\nwill compare the character of the bank surrounding the hilly island of\r\nOld Providence, with those banks in its neighbourhood which stand\r\nisolated, will scarcely doubt that they surround submerged mountains.\r\nWe are led to the same conclusion by examining the bank called Thunder\r\nKnoll, which is separated from the Great Mosquito Bank by a channel\r\nonly seven miles wide, and 145 fathoms deep. There cannot be any doubt\r\nthat the Mosquito Bank has been formed by the accumulation of sediment\r\nround the promontory of the same name; and Thunder Knoll resembles the\r\nMosquito Bank, in the state of its surface submerged twenty fathoms, in\r\nthe inclinations of its sides, in composition, and in every other\r\nrespect. I may observe, although the remark is here irrelevant, that\r\ngeologists should be cautious in concluding that all the outlyers of\r\nany formation have once been connected together, for we here see that\r\ndeposits, doubtless of exactly the same nature, may be deposited with\r\nlarge valley-like spaces between them.\r\n\r\nLinear strips of coral-reefs and small knolls project from many of the\r\nisolated, as well as coast-banks; sometimes they occur quite\r\nirregularly placed, as on the Mosquito Bank, but more generally they\r\nform crescents on the windward side, situated some little distance\r\nwithin the outer edge of the banks:—thus on the Serranilla Bank they\r\nform an interrupted chain which ranges between two and three miles\r\nwithin the windward margin: generally they occur, as on Roncador,\r\nCourtown, and Anegada Banks, nearer the line of deep water. Their\r\noccurrence on the windward side is conformable to the general rule, of\r\nthe efficient kinds of corals flourishing best where most exposed; but\r\ntheir position some way within the line of deep water I cannot explain,\r\nwithout it be, that a depth somewhat less than that close to the outer\r\nmargin of the banks, is most favourable to their growth. Where the\r\ncorals have formed a nearly continuous rim, close to the windward edge\r\nof a bank some fathoms submerged, the reef closely resembles an atoll;\r\nbut if the bank surrounds an island (as in the case of Old Providence),\r\nthe reef resembles an encircling barrier-reef. I should undoubtedly\r\nhave classed some of these fringed banks as imperfect atolls, or\r\nbarrier-reefs, if the sedimentary nature of their foundations had not\r\nbeen evident from the presence of other neighbouring banks, of similar\r\nforms and of similar composition, but without the crescent-like\r\nmarginal reef: in the third chapter, I observed that probably some\r\natoll-like reefs did exist, which had originated in the manner here\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nProofs of elevation within recent tertiary periods abound, as referred\r\nto in the sixth chapter, over nearly the whole area of the West Indies.\r\nHence it is easy to understand the origin of the low land on the\r\ncoasts, where sediment is now accumulating; for instance on the\r\nnorthern part of Yucutan, and on the N.E. part of Mosquito, where the\r\nland is low, and where extensive banks appear to be in progressive\r\nformation. Hence, also, the origin of the Great Bahama Banks, which are\r\nbordered on their western and southern edges by very narrow, long,\r\nsingularly shaped islands, formed of sand, shells, and coral-rock, and\r\nsome of them about a hundred feet in height, is easily explained by the\r\nelevation of banks fringed on their windward (western and southern)\r\nsides by coral-reefs. On this view, however, we must suppose either\r\nthat the chief part of the surfaces of the great Bahama sandbanks were\r\nall originally deeply submerged, and were brought up to their present\r\nlevel by the same elevatory action, which formed the linear islands; or\r\nthat during the elevation of the banks, the superficial currents and\r\nswell of the waves continued wearing them down and keeping them at a\r\nnearly uniform level: the level is not quite uniform; for, in\r\nproceeding from the N.W. end of the Bahama group towards the S.E. end,\r\nthe depth of the banks increases, and the area of land decreases, in a\r\nvery gradual and remarkable manner. The latter view, namely, that these\r\nbanks have been worn down by the currents and swell during their\r\nelevation, seems to me the most probable one. It is, also, I believe,\r\napplicable to many banks, situated in widely distant parts of the West\r\nIndian Sea, which are wholly submerged; for, on any other view, we must\r\nsuppose, that the elevatory forces have acted with astonishing\r\nuniformity.\r\n\r\nThe shore of the Gulf of Mexico, for the space of many hundred miles,\r\nis formed by a chain of lagoons, from one to twenty miles in breadth\r\n(“Columbian Navigator,” page 178, etc.), containing either fresh or\r\nsalt water, and separated from the sea by linear strips of sand. Great\r\nspaces of the shores of Southern Brazil.[4] and of the United States\r\nfrom Long Island (as observed by Professor Rogers) to Florida have the\r\nsame character. Professor Rogers, in his “Report to the British\r\nAssociation” (volume iii., page 13), speculates on the origin of these\r\nlow, sandy, linear islets; he states that the layers of which they are\r\ncomposed are too homogeneous, and contain too large a proportion of\r\nshells, to permit the common supposition of their formation being\r\nsimply due to matter thrown up, where it now lies, by the surf: he\r\nconsiders these islands as upheaved bars or shoals, which were\r\ndeposited in lines where opposed currents met. It is evident that these\r\nislands and spits of sand parallel to the coast, and separated from it\r\nby shallow lagoons, have no necessary connection with coral-formations.\r\nBut in Southern Florida, from the accounts I have received from persons\r\nwho have resided there, the upraised islands seem to be formed of\r\nstrata, containing a good deal of coral, and they are extensively\r\nfringed by living reefs; the channels within these islands are in some\r\nplaces between two and three miles wide, and five or six fathoms deep,\r\nthough generally[5] they are less in depth than width. After having\r\nseen how frequently banks of sediment in the West Indian Sea are\r\nfringed by reefs, we can readily conceive that bars of sediment might\r\nbe greatly aided in their formation along a line of coast, by the\r\ngrowth of corals; and such bars would, in that case, have a deceptive\r\nresemblance with true barrier-reefs.\r\n\r\n [4] In the “London and Edinburgh Philosophical Journal,” 1841, page\r\n 257, I have described a singular bar of sandstone lying parallel to\r\n the coast off Pernambuco in Brazil, which probably is an analogous\r\n formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n [5] In the ordinary sea-charts, no lagoons appear on the coast of\r\n Florida, north of 26°; but Major Whiting (“Silliman’s Journal,” volume\r\n xxxv., page 54) says that many are formed by sand thrown up along the\r\n whole line of coast from St. Augustine’s to Jupiter Inlet.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now endeavoured to remove some sources of doubt in classifying\r\nthe reefs of the West Indies, I will give my authorities for colouring\r\nsuch portions of the coast as I have thought myself warranted in doing.\r\nCaptain Bird Allen informs me, that most of the islands on the _Bahama\r\nBanks_ are fringed, especially on their windward sides, with living\r\nreefs; and hence I have coloured those, which are thus represented in\r\nCaptain Owen’s late chart, red. The same officer informs me, that the\r\nislands along the southern part of _Florida_ are similarly fringed;\r\ncoloured red. CUBA: Proceeding along the northern coast, at the\r\ndistance of forty miles from the extreme S.E. point, the shores are\r\nfringed by reefs, which extend westward for a space of 160 miles, with\r\nonly a few breaks. Parts of these reefs are represented in the plans of\r\nthe harbours on this coast by Captain Owen; and an excellent\r\ndescription is given of them by Mr. Taylor (Loudon’s “Mag. of Nat.\r\nHist.” volume ix., page 449); he states that they enclosed a space\r\ncalled the “_baxo_,” from half to three-quarters of a mile in width,\r\nwith a sandy bottom, and a little coral. In most parts people can wade,\r\nat low water, to the reef; but in some parts the depth is between two\r\nand three fathoms. Close outside the reef, the depth is between six and\r\nseven fathoms; these well-characterised fringing-reefs are coloured\r\nred. Westward of longitude 77° 30′, on the northern side of Cuba, a\r\ngreat bank commences, which extends along the coast for nearly four\r\ndegrees of longitude. In the place of its commencement, in its\r\nstructure, and in the “_cays_,” or low islands on its edge, there is a\r\nmarked correspondence (as observed by Humboldt, “Pers. Narr.” volume\r\nvii., page 88) between it and the Great Bahama and Sal Banks, which lie\r\ndirectly in front. Hence one is led to attribute the same origin to\r\nboth these sets of banks; namely, the accumulation of sediment,\r\nconjoined with an elevatory movement, and the growth of coral on their\r\noutward edges; those parts which appear fringed by living reefs are\r\ncoloured red. Westward of these banks, there is a portion of coast\r\napparently without reefs, except in the harbours, the shores of which\r\nseem in the published plans to be fringed. The _Colorado Shoals_ (see\r\nCaptain Owen’s charts), and the low land at the western end of Cuba,\r\ncorrespond as closely in relative position and structure to the banks\r\nat the extreme point of Florida, as the banks above described on the\r\nnorth side of Cuba, do to the Bahamas, the depth within the islets and\r\nreefs on the outer edge of the _Colorados_, is generally between two\r\nand three fathoms, increasing to twelve fathoms in the southern part,\r\nwhere the bank becomes nearly open, without islets or coral-reefs; the\r\nportions which are fringed are coloured red. The southern shore of Cuba\r\nis deeply concave, and the included space is filled up with mud and\r\nsandbanks, low islands and coral-reefs. Between the mountainous _Isle\r\nof Pines_ and the southern shore of Cuba, the general depth is only\r\nbetween two and three fathoms; and in this part small islands, formed\r\nof fragmentary rock and broken madrepores (Humboldt, “Pers. Narr.”\r\nvolume vii. pages 51, 86 to 90, 291, 309, 320), rise abruptly, and just\r\nreach the surface of the sea. From some expressions used in the\r\n“Columbian Navigator” (volume i., part ii., page 94), it appears that\r\nconsiderable spaces along the outer coast of Southern Cuba are bounded\r\nby cliffs of coral-rock, formed probably by the upheaval of coral-reefs\r\nand sandbanks. The charts represent the southern part of the Isle of\r\nPines as fringed by reefs, which the “Columb. Navig.” says extend some\r\nway from the coast, but have only from nine to twelve feet water on\r\nthem; these are coloured red.—I have not been able to procure any\r\ndetailed description of the large groups of banks and “cays” further\r\neastward on the southern side of Cuba; within them there is a large\r\nexpanse, with a muddy bottom, from eight to twelve fathoms deep;\r\nalthough some parts of this line of coast are represented in the\r\ngeneral charts of the West Indies, as fringed, I have not thought it\r\nprudent to colour them. The remaining portion of the south coast of\r\nCuba appears to be without coral-reefs.\r\n\r\nYUCUTAN.—The N.E. part of the promontory appears in Captain Owen’s\r\ncharts to be fringed; coloured red. The eastern coast, from 20° to 18°\r\nis fringed. South of latitude 18°, there commences the most remarkable\r\nreef in the West Indies: it is about one hundred and thirty miles in\r\nlength, ranging in a N. and S. line, at an average distance of fifteen\r\nmiles from the coast. The islets on it are all low, as I have been\r\ninformed by Captain B. Allen; the water deepens suddenly on the outside\r\nof the reef, but not more abruptly than off many of the sedimentary\r\nbanks: within its southern extremity (off _Honduras_) the depth is\r\ntwenty-five fathoms; but in the more northern parts, the depth soon\r\nincreases to ten fathoms, and within the northernmost part, for a space\r\nof twenty miles, the depth is only from one to two fathoms. In most of\r\nthese respects we have the characteristics of a barrier-reef;\r\nnevertheless, from observing, first, that the channel within the reef\r\nis a continuation of a great irregular bay, which penetrates the\r\nmainland to the depth of fifty miles; and secondly, that considerable\r\nspaces of this barrier-like reef are described in the charts (for\r\ninstance, in latitude 16° 45′ and 16° 12′) as formed of pure sand; and\r\nthirdly, from knowing that sediment is accumulating in many parts of\r\nthe West Indies in banks parallel to the shore; I have not ventured to\r\ncolour this reef as a barrier, without further evidence that it has\r\nreally been formed by the growth of corals, and that it is not merely\r\nin parts a spit of sand, and in other parts a worn down promontory,\r\npartially coated and fringed by reefs; I lean, however, to the\r\nprobability of its being a barrier-reef, produced by subsidence. To add\r\nto my doubts, immediately on the outside of this barrier-like reef,\r\n_Turneffe_, _Lighthouse_, and _Glover_ reefs are situated, and these\r\nreefs have so completely the form of atolls, that if they had occurred\r\nin the Pacific, I should not have hesitated about colouring them blue.\r\n_turneffe Reef_ seems almost entirely filled up with low mud islets;\r\nand the depth within the other two reefs is only from one to three\r\nfathoms. From this circumstance and from their similarity in form,\r\nstructure, and relative position, both to the bank called _Northern\r\nTriangles_, on which there is an islet between seventy and eighty feet,\r\nand to _Cozumel_ Island, the level surface of which is likewise between\r\nseventy and eighty feet in height, I consider it more probable that the\r\nthree foregoing banks are the worn down bases of upheaved shoals,\r\nfringed with corals, than that they are true atolls, wholly produced by\r\nthe growth of coral during subsidence; left uncoloured.\r\n\r\nIn front of the eastern _Mosquito_ coast, there are between latitude\r\n12° and 16° some extensive banks (already mentioned, page 148), with\r\nhigh islands rising from their centres; and there are other banks\r\nwholly submerged, both of which kinds of banks are bordered, near their\r\nwindward margins, by crescent-shaped coral-reefs. But it can hardly be\r\ndoubted, as was observed in the preliminary remarks, that these banks\r\nowe their origin, like the great bank extending from the Mosquito\r\npromontory, almost entirely to the accumulation of sediment, and not to\r\nthe growth of corals; hence I have not coloured them.\r\n\r\n_Cayman Island_: this island appears in the charts to be fringed; and\r\nCaptain B. Allen informs me that the reefs extend about a mile from the\r\nshore, and have only from five to twelve feet water within them;\r\ncoloured red.—_Jamaica_: judging from the charts, about fifteen miles\r\nof the S.E. extremity, and about twice that length on the S.W.\r\nextremity, and some portions on the S. side near Kingston and Port\r\nRoyal, are regularly fringed, and therefore are coloured red. From the\r\nplans of some harbours on the N. side of Jamaica, parts of the coast\r\nappear to be fringed; but as these are not represented in the charts of\r\nthe whole island, I have not coloured them.—_St. Domingo_: I have not\r\nbeen able to obtain sufficient information, either from plans of the\r\nharbours, or from general charts, to enable me to colour any part of\r\nthe coast, except sixty miles from Port de Plata westward, which seems\r\nvery regularly fringed; many other parts, however, of the coast are\r\nprobably fringed, especially towards the eastern end of the\r\nisland.—_Puerto Rico_: considerable portions of the southern, western,\r\nand eastern coasts, and some parts of the northern coast, appear in the\r\ncharts to be fringed; coloured red.—Some miles in length of the\r\nsouthern side of the Island of _St, Thomas_ is fringed; most of the\r\n_Virgin Gorda_ Islands, as I am informed by Mr. Schomburgk, are\r\nfringed; the shores of _Anegada_, as well as the bank on which it\r\nstands, are likewise fringed; these islands have been coloured red. The\r\ngreater part of the southern side of _Santa Cruz_ appears in the Danish\r\nsurvey to be fringed (see also Prof. Hovey’s account of this island, in\r\n“Silliman’s Journal,” volume xxxv., page 74); the reefs extend along\r\nthe shore for a considerable space, and project rather more than a\r\nmile; the depth within the reef is three fathoms; coloured red.—The\r\n_Antilles_, as remarked by Von Buch (“Descrip. Iles Canaries,” page\r\n494), may be divided into two linear groups, the western row being\r\nvolcanic, and the eastern of modern calcareous origin; my information\r\nis very defective on the whole group. Of the eastern islands, _Barbuda_\r\nand the western coasts of _Antigua_ and _Mariagalante_ appear to be\r\nfringed: this is also the case with _Barbadoes_, as I have been\r\ninformed by a resident; these islands are coloured red. On the shores\r\nof the Western Antilles, of volcanic origin, very few coral-reefs\r\nappear to exist. The island of _Martinique_, of which there are\r\nbeautifully executed French charts, on a very large scale, alone\r\npresents any appearance worthy of special notice. The south-western,\r\nsouthern, and eastern coasts, together forming about half the\r\ncircumference of the island, are skirted by very irregular banks,\r\nprojecting generally rather less than a mile from the shore, and lying\r\nfrom two to five fathoms submerged. In front of almost every valley,\r\nthey are breached by narrow, crooked, steep-sided passages. The French\r\nengineers ascertained by boring, that these submerged banks consisted\r\nof madreporitic rocks, which were covered in many parts by thin layers\r\nof mud or sand. From this fact, and especially from the structure of\r\nthe narrow breaches, I think there can be little doubt that these banks\r\nonce formed living reefs, which fringed the shores of the island, and\r\nlike other reefs probably reached the surface. From some of these\r\nsubmerged banks reefs of living coral rise abruptly, either in small\r\ndetached patches, or in lines parallel to, but some way within the\r\nouter edges of the banks on which they are based. Besides the above\r\nbanks which skirt the shores of the island, there is on the eastern\r\nside a range of linear banks, similarly constituted, twenty miles in\r\nlength, extending parallel to the coast line, and separated from it by\r\na space between two and four miles in width, and from five to fifteen\r\nfathoms in depth. From this range of detached banks, some linear reefs\r\nof living coral likewise rise abruptly; and if they had been of greater\r\nlength (for they do not front more than a sixth part of the\r\ncircumference of the island), they would necessarily from their\r\nposition have been coloured as barrier-reefs; as the case stands they\r\nare left uncoloured. I suspect that after a small amount of subsidence,\r\nthe corals were killed by sand and mud being deposited on them, and the\r\nreefs being thus prevented from growing upwards, the banks of\r\nmadreporitic rock were left in their present submerged condition.\r\n\r\nTHE BERMUDA ISLANDS have been carefully described by Lieutenant Nelson,\r\nin an excellent Memoir in the “Geological Transactions” (volume v.,\r\npart i., page 103). In the form of the bank or reef, on one side of\r\nwhich the islands stand, there is a close general resemblance to an\r\natoll; but in the following respects there is a considerable\r\ndifference,—first, in the margin of the reef not forming (as I have\r\nbeen informed by Mr. Chaffers, R.N.) a flat, solid surface, laid bare\r\nat low water, and regularly bounding the internal space of shallow\r\nwater or lagoon; secondly, in the border of gradually shoaling water,\r\nnearly a mile and a half in width, which surrounds the entire outside\r\nof the reef (as is laid down in Captain Hurd’s chart); and thirdly, in\r\nthe size, height, and extraordinary form of the islands, which present\r\nlittle resemblance to the long, narrow, simple islets, seldom exceeding\r\nhalf a mile in breadth, which surmount the annular reefs of almost all\r\nthe atolls in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. Moreover, there are\r\nevident proofs (Nelson, Ibid., page 118), that islands similar to the\r\nexisting ones, formerly extended over other parts of the reef. It\r\nwould, I believe, be difficult to find a true atoll with land exceeding\r\nthirty feet in height; whereas, Mr. Nelson estimates the highest point\r\nof the Bermuda Islands to be 260 feet; if, however, Mr. Nelson’s view,\r\nthat the whole of the land consists of sand drifted by the winds, and\r\nagglutinated together, were proved correct, this difference would be\r\nimmaterial; but, from his own account (page 118), there occur in one\r\nplace, five or six layers of red earth, interstratified with the\r\nordinary calcareous rock, and including stones too heavy for the wind\r\nto have moved, without having at the same time utterly dispersed every\r\ngrain of the accompanying drifted matter. Mr. Nelson attributes the\r\norigin of these several layers, with their embedded stones, to as many\r\nviolent catastrophes; but further investigation in such cases has\r\ngenerally succeeded in explaining phenomena of this kind by ordinary\r\nand simpler means. Finally, I may remark, that these islands have a\r\nconsiderable resemblance in shape to Barbuda in the West Indies, and to\r\nPemba on the eastern coast of Africa, which latter island is about two\r\nhundred feet in height, and consists of coral-rock. I believe that the\r\nBermuda Islands, from being fringed by living reefs, ought to have been\r\ncoloured red; but I have left them uncoloured, on account of their\r\ngeneral resemblance in external form to a lagoon-island or atoll.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe names not in capitals are all names of places, and refer\r\nexclusively to the Appendix: in well-defined archipelagoes, or groups\r\nof islands, the name of each separate island is not given.\r\n\r\nABROLHOS, Brazil, coated by corals.\r\n\r\nAbrolhos (Australia).\r\n\r\nABSENCE of coral-reefs from certain coasts.\r\n\r\nAcaba, gulf of.\r\n\r\nAdmiralty group.\r\n\r\nAFRICA, east coast, fringing-reef of.\r\nMadreporitic rock of.\r\n\r\nAfrica, east coast.\r\n\r\nAGE of individual corals.\r\n\r\nAiou.\r\n\r\nAitutaki.\r\n\r\nAldabra.\r\n\r\nAlert reef.\r\n\r\nAlexander, Grand Duke, island.\r\n\r\nALLAN, Dr., on Holuthuriæ feeding on corals.
