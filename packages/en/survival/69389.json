The first attempts to reach China by sea, were\r\nmade by steering along the coast of Africa toward the south, and the\r\nnext, by proceeding from the European shore in a westerly direction.\r\nThe former, which first proved successful, was accomplished by\r\nVasquez de Gama, a Portuguese, in the year 1497-8; and the latter was\r\nundertaken by the renowned navigator, Columbus, in 1492. The notion\r\nof steering to India by the north-west, as the shortest way, was\r\nsuggested about the middle or latter end of the fifteenth century,\r\nby John Vaz Costa Cortereal, who performed a voyage to Newfoundland\r\nabout the year 1463-4; or, according to a more general opinion,\r\nby John Cabot, the father of the celebrated Sebastian Cabot, who\r\nattempted the navigation in 1497, and perhaps also in 1494-5. The\r\nidea of a passage to India by the North Pole was suggested by Robert\r\nThorne, merchant of Bristol, as early as the year 1527; and the\r\nopinion of a passage by the north-east was proposed soon afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe universal interest which has been attached to this question of\r\na sea communication between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, by the\r\nnorth, ever since it was first suggested, about three hundred and\r\nthirty or three hundred and fifty years ago, is fully proved by the\r\nfacts, that the speculation has never but once been abandoned by the\r\nnations of Europe for more than twenty-five years together, and that\r\nthere have been only three or four intervals of more than fifteen\r\nyears in which no expedition was sent out in search of one or other\r\nof the supposed passages, from the year 1500 down to the present\r\ntime. And it is not a little surprising that, after nearly a hundred\r\ndifferent voyages have been undertaken with a view of discovering\r\nthe desired communication with the Indian seas, all of which have\r\nfailed, Britain should again revive and attempt the solution of this\r\ninteresting problem.\r\n\r\nSeveral facts may be brought forward, on which arguments of no mean\r\nforce may be founded, in support of the opinion of the existence of a\r\nsea communication by the north between Europe and China. They may be\r\nenumerated in order.\r\n\r\n1. The prevailing current in the Spitzbergen sea flows, we are\r\nwell assured, during nine months of the year, if not all the year\r\nround, from the north-east towards the south-west. The velocity of\r\nthis current may be from five to twenty miles per day, varying in\r\ndifferent situations, but is most considerable near the coast of\r\nOld Greenland. The current, on the other hand, in the middle of\r\nBehring’s Strait, as observed by lieutenant Kotzebue, sets strongly\r\nto the north-east, with a velocity, as he thought, of two miles and\r\na half an hour; which is greater, however, by one-half than the rate\r\nobserved by captain Cook.\r\n\r\n2. By the action of the south-westerly current, a vast quantity\r\nof ice is annually brought from the north and east, and conducted\r\nalong the east shore of Old Greenland as far as Cape Farewell,\r\nwhere such masses as still remain undissolved are soon destroyed by\r\nthe influence of the solar heat and the force of the sea, to which\r\nthey then become exposed from almost every quarter. This ice being\r\nentirely free from salt, and very compact, appears originally to\r\nhave consisted of field-ice, a kind which perhaps requires the\r\naction of frost for many years to bring it to the thickness which\r\nit assumes. The quantity of heavy ice, in surface, which is thus\r\nannually dissolved, may, at a rough calculation, be stated to be\r\nabout twenty thousand square leagues, while the quantity annually\r\ngenerated in the regions accessible to the whale-fishers is,\r\nprobably, not more than one-fourth of that area. As such, the ice,\r\nwhich is so inexhaustible, must require an immense surface of sea for\r\nits generation, perhaps the whole or greater part of the so-called\r\n“Polar Basin;” the supply required for replacing what is dissolved\r\nin Behring’s Strait, where the current sets towards the north,\r\nbeing, probably, of small moment. The current, in opposite parts of\r\nthe northern hemisphere, being thus found to follow the same line\r\nof direction, indicates a communication between the two across the\r\nPoles; and the inexhaustible supply of ice, affording about fifteen\r\nthousand square leagues, to be annually dissolved above the quantity\r\ngenerated in the known parts of the Spitzbergen seas, supports the\r\nsame conclusion.\r\n\r\n3. The origin of the considerable quantity of drift-wood, found in\r\nalmost every part of the Greenland sea, is traced to some country\r\nbeyond the Pole, and may be brought forward in aid of the opinion\r\nof the existence of a sea communication between the Atlantic and\r\nthe Pacific; which argument receives additional strength from the\r\ncircumstance of some of the drift-wood being worm-eaten. This last\r\nfact I first observed on the shores of the island of Jan Mayen, in\r\nAugust, 1817, and confirmed it by more particular observation when at\r\nSpitzbergen the year following. Having no axe with me when I observed\r\nthe worm-eaten wood, and having no means of bringing it away, I could\r\nnot ascertain whether the holes observed in the timber were the work\r\nof a _ptinus_ or a _pholas_. In either case, however, as it is not\r\nknown that these animals ever pierce wood in arctic countries, it is\r\npresumed that the worm-eaten drift-wood is derived from a transpolar\r\nregion. Numerous facts of this nature might be adduced, all of which\r\nsupport the same conclusion.\r\n\r\n4. The northern faces of the continents of Europe and Asia, as well\r\nas of that of America, so far as yet known, are such as renders it\r\ndifficult even to imagine such a position for the unascertained\r\nregions, as to cut off the communication between the Frozen Sea, near\r\nthe meridian of London, and that in the opposite part of the northern\r\nhemisphere, near Behring’s Strait.\r\n\r\n5. Whales, which have been harpooned in the Greenland seas, have been\r\nfound in the Pacific Ocean; and whales, with stone lances sticking\r\nin their fat, (a kind of weapon used by no nation now known,) have\r\nbeen caught both in the sea of Spitsbergen and in Davis’s Strait.\r\nThis fact, which is sufficiently authenticated, seems to me the most\r\nsatisfactory argument.\r\n\r\nThe Russians, it appears, have, at intervals, discovered all the\r\nnavigation between Archangel and the Strait of Behring, excepting a\r\nportion of about two hundred miles, occupied by the eastern part of a\r\nnoss, or promontory, lying between the rivers Khatanga and Piacina.\r\nThe northern extremity of this noss, called Cape Ceverovostochnoi,\r\nappears to have been doubled by lieutenant Prontschitscheff, in the\r\nyear 1735, so that ice, and perhaps some small islands, seem in this\r\nplace to form the great obstruction to the navigation. As far as can\r\nbe well substantiated, the portion of the route between Archangel\r\nand Kamtchatka, which has been hitherto accomplished, clearly proves\r\nthat, if a sea communication between the Atlantic and Pacific by the\r\nnorth-east really exists, it could never be practicable in one year.\r\nInasmuch as the Russians were five or six years in performing so much\r\nof the navigation as has been accomplished, though they employed a\r\nnumber of different vessels in the undertaking, it is probable that\r\nthe voyage could never be performed in one vessel, unless by mere\r\naccident, in less than eight or ten years. It is clear, therefore,\r\nthat the discovery of a “north-east passage” could never be of any\r\nadvantage to our commerce with China or India.\r\n\r\nThough, however, the voyages undertaken in search of a north-east\r\npassage by the different nations of Europe have amounted to about\r\ntwelve, besides numerous partial attempts by the Russians, and though\r\nall of them have failed in their principal intention, yet they have\r\nnot been wholly lost to us; the Spitzbergen whale and seal fisheries,\r\nso valuable to the country, with the trade to Archangel, having\r\narisen out of them.\r\n\r\nThe voyages of Davis, in the years 1585-6 and 1587-8, of Hudson, in\r\n1610, and of Baffin, in 1616, were the source of the greatest part\r\nof the discoveries which have been made in the countries situated\r\nto the northward and westward of the south point of Greenland.\r\nTo these regions, consisting of what have been called bays and\r\nstraits, the names of these celebrated voyagers have been applied.\r\nAll the voyages, indeed, since undertaken for discovery in the\r\nsame quarter, amounting to nearly thirty, have done little more\r\nthan confirm the researches of these three individuals, and show\r\nhow little there was to be found, instead of discovering anything\r\nof moment. The ostensible object of most of these voyages, was the\r\ndiscovery of a shorter passage to India than that by the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, by the north-west. The existence of such a passage is\r\nnot yet either proved or refuted. In an account of “a Voyage to\r\nHudson’s Bay,” by Henry Ellis, such a passage is inferred to exist\r\nfrom the following considerations:—the want of trees on the west\r\nside of Hudson’s Bay beyond a certain latitude; the appearance of a\r\ncertain ridge of mountains lying near the same coast, and extending\r\nin a direction parallel to it; the direct testimony of the Indians,\r\nthat they have seen the sea beyond the mountains, and have observed\r\nvessels navigating therein; and, most particularly, the nature and\r\npeculiarities observed in the tides. This latter argument is by far\r\nthe most conclusive. From observations on the winds and tides in the\r\nBaltic, Mediterranean, and other inland seas, Ellis proceeds to show,\r\nthat every circumstance with regard to the tides in Hudson’s Bay\r\nis different from what would take place in an inland sea, and then\r\nconcludes that Hudson’s Bay is not such a sea, but has some opening\r\nwhich communicates with the Frozen Ocean on the north-west.\r\n\r\nOther arguments, which have been offered in favour of the separation\r\nof Greenland from America, are deduced from the existence of a\r\ncurrent setting from the north—from the circumstance of icebergs and\r\ndrift-wood being brought down by the current—from whales wounded in\r\nthe Spitzbergen seas having been caught in Davis’s Strait—from the\r\nposition of the land, as represented on skins by the native American\r\nIndians—and from the occurrence of certain plants in Greenland, which\r\nare natives of Europe, but have never been found in any part of the\r\nAmerican continent.\r\n\r\nThe opinion appears to be quite incorrect, that if a passage were\r\ndiscovered, it would, probably, be open above half the year. I\r\nimagine it would be only at intervals of years that it would be open\r\nat all, and then, perhaps, for no longer time than eight or ten\r\nweeks in a season. Hence, as affording a navigation to the Pacific\r\nOcean, the discovery of a north-west passage would be of no service.\r\nFor many reasons, however, the examination of these interesting\r\ncountries is an object worthy of the attention of a great nation.\r\nThe advantages that have already arisen to Britain from the voyages\r\nundertaken in search of a north-west passage are, the establishment\r\nof the Davis’s Strait’s whale-fishery, and of the trade of the\r\nHudson’s Bay company, so that the expenditure has not altogether been\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous spirit manifested by our early navigators, in\r\nperforming such hazardous voyages in small barks, in which we should\r\nbe scrupulous of trusting ourselves across the German Ocean, is\r\ncalculated to strike us with surprise and admiration, while the\r\ncorrectness of their investigations gives us a high opinion of their\r\nperseverance and talent. The famous voyage of Baffin, in which the\r\nbay bearing his name was discovered, was performed in a vessel of\r\nonly fifty-five tons’ burden; that of Hudson, in which also the bay\r\ncalled by his name was first navigated, in the very same vessel; and\r\nthe voyages of Davis chiefly in vessels of fifty, thirty-five, and\r\nten tons’ burden.\r\n\r\nIn perusing the voyages of our old navigators, it is particularly\r\ngratifying to those who consider religion as the chief business of\r\nthis life, to observe the strain of piety and dependence upon Divine\r\nProvidence which runs through almost every narrative. Their honest\r\nand laudable acknowledgments of a particular interference of the\r\nAlmighty, working out deliverance for them in times of difficulty\r\nand danger, and their frequent declarations expressive of their\r\nreliance upon Providence, for assistance and protection in their\r\nadventurous undertakings, are worthy of our imitation. Thus, while\r\nour modern voyagers are much in the habit of attributing their most\r\nremarkable deliverances to “luck,” “chance,” and “fortune,” those of\r\nold evidenced certainly a more Christian-like feeling, under such\r\ncircumstances, by referring their deliverances to that great Being,\r\nfrom whom alone every good thing must be derived. They only who have\r\na similar dependence on Providence, and who have been occasionally\r\nin trying situations, can duly appreciate the confidence and comfort\r\nwhich this belief is calculated to afford under the most appalling\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe class of vessels best adapted for discovery in the Polar seas,\r\nseems to be that of one hundred to two hundred tons’ burden. They\r\nare stronger, more easily managed, in less danger of being stoved or\r\ncrushed by ice, and not so expensive as those of larger dimensions.\r\nAn increase of size is a diminution of comparative strength; and\r\nhence it is evident, that a vessel intended for discovery should be\r\njust large enough for conveying the requisite stores and provisions,\r\nand for affording comfortable accommodation to the navigators, but\r\nno larger. Perhaps a vessel about one hundred and fifty tons’ burden\r\nwould be fully sufficient to answer every purpose. The navigation of\r\nthe Polar seas, which is peculiar, requires in a particular manner an\r\nextensive knowledge of the nature, properties, and usual motions of\r\nthe ice, and it can only be performed to the best advantage by those\r\nwho have had long experience in working a ship in icy situations.\r\nIt might be a material assistance to those employed in completing\r\nthe examination of Baffin’s Bay, as well as productive of some\r\ninteresting information in meteorological phenomena, were a vessel or\r\ntwo to remain in the northern part of this bay through the winter.\r\nThere is very little doubt that the vessel would, by this method, be\r\nreleased by the ice as early as May or June, and thus be afforded\r\nabout double the time of research that could be obtained by wintering\r\nout of the bay. There would not, I imagine, be any very great danger\r\nin making this experiment, provided a sufficient quantity of fresh\r\nprovisions, for the prevention of the scurvy among the crew, were\r\ntaken out, and certain precautions adopted for the preservation of\r\nthe ships. The ingenious apparatus invented by Mr. Thomas Morton\r\ndesigned to supersede, in repairing vessels, the necessity of dry\r\ndocks, might be eminently advantageous.\r\n\r\nIn seas perpetually encumbered with ice, and probably crowded with\r\nislands, if not divided by necks of land, the chance of great\r\ndiscoveries and of extensive navigations towards the north-west,\r\neven under the best arrangements and under the boldest seamen, is\r\nbut small. The most certain method of ascertaining the existence of\r\na communication between the Atlantic and Pacific, along the northern\r\nface of America, would doubtless be by journeys on land. Men there\r\nare who, being long used to travel upon snow in the service of the\r\nHudson’s Bay company, would readily undertake the journey by the\r\ninterior lakes of North America to the Frozen Ocean, or, in case of\r\na continuity of land being found, to the very Pole itself, of whose\r\nsuccess we should certainly have a reasonable ground of hope. The\r\npracticability of this mode of making discoveries has been fully\r\nproved by the expeditions of Mackenzie and Hearne; and a possibility\r\nof performing very long journeys on snow can be attested, from\r\npersonal experience, by those who have wintered a few times in\r\nHudson’s Bay.\r\n\r\nThe plan of performing a journey in this way, for discovering the\r\nnorthern termination of the American continent, and for tracing\r\nit round to its junction with the coasts of the same country,\r\nwashed by the Atlantic, might be in some measure as follows. The\r\nparty intended for this expedition, which should consist of as few\r\nindividuals as possible, ought, perhaps, in the course of one summer,\r\nto make their way to one of the interior settlements of the Hudson’s\r\nBay company, or of the Canadian traders, such as Slave Fort, on the\r\ngreat Slave Lake, situated in the 62nd degree of latitude, or Fort\r\nChepewyan, near the Athapescow Lake, in latitude 58° 40′, from whence\r\nsir Alexander Mackenzie embarked on his voyage to the Frozen Ocean,\r\nand there abide during the first winter. Supposing the travellers\r\nto winter at Slave Fort, they might calculate on being within the\r\ndistance of two hundred leagues, or thirty or forty days’ journey,\r\nmoderate travelling, of the Frozen Ocean. In the month of March or\r\nApril, the party, consisting of two or three Europeans, one or two\r\nEsquimaux interpreters, and two or more Indian guides, provided with\r\neverything requisite for the undertaking, might set out towards the\r\nnorth. On the arrival of the travellers among the Esquimaux, their\r\nIndian guides, from fear of this nation, would probably desert them,\r\nbut the presence of their Esquimaux interpreters would secure them\r\na good reception. When once they should meet with this people, they\r\nwould have a strong evidence of being near the sea, as it is well\r\nknown the Esquimaux never retire far from the coast. On their arrival\r\nat the coast, it will be necessary to associate with the Esquimaux,\r\nto submit in some measure to their mode of living, and, to effect\r\nany considerable discovery, it might be requisite to spend a winter\r\nor two among them, in which case they might trace the line of the\r\nFrozen Ocean to such a length, that the place where it joins the\r\nwestern coast of Baffin’s Bay, or Hudson’s Bay, or the eastern side\r\nof Greenland, would be determined. Or, if it should be objectionable\r\nto winter among the Esquimaux, several expeditions might be sent out\r\nat the same time from different stations, and on different meridians.\r\nThe expense of three or four such expeditions over land would\r\nprobably be less than that of one expedition by sea.\r\n\r\nThe scheme suggested by Robert Thorne, of Bristol, of finding a\r\npassage to India across the North Pole, about the year 1527, appears\r\nto have been immediately attempted by an expedition, consisting of\r\ntwo ships, sent out by order of Henry VIII.; one of the ships, we\r\nare informed, was lost; of the nature of the success of the other we\r\nhave but a very unsatisfactory account. After this voyage, Barentz,\r\nHeemskerke, and Ryp, attempted the transpolar navigation, in 1596;\r\nHudson, in 1607; Jonas Poole, in 1610 and 1611; Baffin and Fotherby,\r\nin 1614; Fotherby, in 1615; Phipps, in 1773; and Buchan and Franklin,\r\nin 1818. The highest latitude attained by any of these navigators did\r\nnot, it would appear, exceed 81°. My father, in the ship Resolution,\r\nof Whitby, in the year 1806, with whom I then served as chief mate,\r\nsailed to a much higher latitude. Our latitude, on three occasions,\r\nin the month of May, as derived from observations taken with a\r\nsextant by myself and my father, was 80° 50′ 28″, 81° 1′ 53″, and\r\n81° 12′ 42″; after which we sailed so far to the northward as made\r\nit about 81° 30′, which is one of the closest approximations to the\r\nPole which I conceive has been well authenticated.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be our opinion of the accounts brought forward by some\r\nparties to prove the occasional accessibility of the 83rd or 84th\r\nparallel of north latitude, of this we may be assured, that the\r\nopinion of an open sea round the Pole is altogether chimerical. It\r\nis urged, indeed, that the extraordinary power of the sun, about the\r\nsummer solstice, is so far greater at the Pole than at the Equator,\r\nas to destroy all the ice generated in the winter season, and to\r\nrender the temperature of the Pole warmer and more congenial to\r\nfeeling than it is in some places lying nearer the Equator. So far,\r\nhowever, from the actual influence of the sun, though acknowledged\r\nat a certain season to be greater at the Pole than at the Equator,\r\nbeing above what it is calculated to be by the ordinary formulæ for\r\ntemperature, it is found by experiment in latitude 78° to be greatly\r\nbelow it—how then can the temperature of the Pole be expected to\r\nbe so very different? From the remarks in the ensuing pages, it\r\nwill be shown that ice is annually formed during nine months of the\r\nyear in the Spitzbergen sea, and that neither calm weather, nor the\r\nproximity of land, is essential for its formation. Can it, then, be\r\nsupposed, that at the Pole, where the mean temperature is probably as\r\nlow as 10°, the sea is not full of ice? If the masses of ice, which\r\nusually prevent the advance of navigators beyond the 82nd degree of\r\nnorth latitude, be extended in a continued series to the Pole, (of\r\nwhich, unless there be land in the way, there appears no doubt,)\r\nthe expectation of reaching the Pole by sea is altogether vain. By\r\nland, however, I do not conceive the journey would be impracticable.\r\nIt would not exceed one thousand two hundred miles, (six hundred\r\nmiles each way,) and might be performed on sledges, drawn by dogs\r\nor reindeer, or even on foot. Foot travellers would require to draw\r\nthe apparatus and provisions, necessary for the undertaking, on\r\nsledges by hand, and in this way, with good dispatch, the journey\r\nwould occupy at least two months; but, with the assistance of dogs,\r\nit might, probably, be accomplished in a little less time. With\r\nfavourable winds, great advantage might be derived from sails set\r\nupon the sledges, which sails, when the travellers were at rest,\r\nwould serve for the erection of tents. Small vacancies in the ice\r\nwould not prevent the journey, as the sledges might be adapted so\r\nas to answer the purpose of boats, nor would the usual unevenness of\r\nthe ice, nor the depth or softness of the snow, be an insurmountable\r\ndifficulty, as journeys of nearly equal length, and under similar\r\ninconveniences, have been accomplished.\r\n\r\nAmong many similar accounts, there is one related by Muller, in\r\nhis “Voyages from Asia to America,” of a Cossack having actually\r\nperformed a journey of about eight hundred miles in a sledge, drawn\r\nby dogs, across a surface of ice lying to the northward of the\r\nRussian dominions, which sufficiently establishes the practicability\r\nof a journey across the ice to the Pole. Alexei Markoff, a Cossack,\r\nwas sent to explore the Frozen Ocean, in the summer of the year 1714,\r\nby order of the Russian government, but finding the sea so crowded\r\nwith ice that he was unable to make any progress in discovery, he\r\nformed the design of travelling in sledges, during the winter or\r\nspring of the year, over the ice, which might then be expected to be\r\nfirm and compact. Accordingly, he prepared several of the country\r\nsledges, drawn by dogs, and accompanied by eight persons, he set\r\nout on the 10th of March from the mouth of the Jana, in latitude\r\n70° 30′, and longitude about 138° east. He proceeded for seven days\r\nnorthward, as fast as his dogs could draw, which, under favourable\r\ncircumstances, is eighty or one hundred versts a day, until his\r\nprogress was impeded, about the 78th degree of latitude, by the\r\nice elevated into prodigious mountains. This prevented his further\r\nadvance; at the same time, falling short of provisions for his dogs,\r\nhis return was effected with difficulty; several of his dogs died for\r\nwant, and were given to the rest for their support. On the 3rd of\r\nApril, he arrived at Ust-Jauskoe Simowie, the place from whence he\r\nstarted, after an absence of twenty-four days, during which time he\r\nappears to have travelled about eight hundred miles. The journey of\r\nMarkoff was nearly equal in extent to the projected journey to the\r\nPole, and there appears no very great reason why a person equally\r\nadventurous with Markoff, and better provided, might not in a similar\r\nmanner reach the Pole.\r\n\r\nThe first considerable discovery which appears to have been made\r\nin or near the arctic circle, was the result of accident; one of\r\nthe numerous Scandinavian depredators, who, in the ninth century,\r\ncruised the northern seas in search of plunder, having been driven,\r\nby a long-continued storm, from the eastward upon the coast of\r\nIceland, in the year 861. This island, from the quantity of snow seen\r\non the mountains, was, by its discoverer Naddodd, at first called\r\n_Schnee_, or _Snowland_. It was visited by a Swede of the name of\r\nGardar Suaffarson, three years after its discovery, and afterwards by\r\nanother Swede, Flocke, from whom it received the name of _Iceland_.\r\nIt was again visited in the year 874, by Ingolf and Lief, two\r\nNorwegians, and became the seat of a Norwegian colony.\r\n\r\nThe coast of Norway, to the entrance of the White Sea, was examined\r\nabout this period by a person of the name of Ohthere, a Norwegian,\r\nwho himself gave an account of his voyage to Alfred the Great, by\r\nwhom it has been handed down to us along with the translation of the\r\nOrmesta of Orosius.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle, or towards the end of the tenth century, an\r\nextensive country, to the westward of Iceland, was discovered by\r\none of the colonists of the name of Gunbiorn, which country was\r\nvisited, in the year 982, by one Eric Rauda, who had fled from Norway\r\nto Iceland, to avoid the punishment due to the crime of murder\r\nand various other offences. To this country he gave the name of\r\n_Greenland_, and in consequence of his exaggerated account of its\r\nproducts and appearance, a respectable colony was founded. About\r\nthe year 1001, one of the Iceland colonists, Biorn by name, was\r\naccidentally driven by a storm to the southward of Greenland, where\r\nhe discovered a new country, covered with wood. Lief, the son of Eric\r\nRauda, fitted out a vessel, and visited the country. Grapes were\r\ndiscovered in it, and from this circumstance it was called _Vinland_;\r\nthe day was eight hours long in winter, whence it appears that it\r\nmust have been somewhere on the coast of North America, probably on\r\nthe shore of Newfoundland.\r\n\r\nThe Christian religion was introduced into Iceland and Greenland\r\nabout the year 1000, and within a hundred years afterwards generally\r\ndiffused. Above sixteen churches were then built, and two convents.\r\nThese buildings, as well as the habitations of the colonists,\r\nwere erected near the southern point of Greenland. They had two\r\nsettlements, the most western of which increased up to four parishes,\r\ncontaining one hundred farms or villages; and the most eastern, to\r\ntwelve parishes, one hundred and ninety villages, one bishop’s see,\r\nand two convents. The intercourse between Greenland and the rest of\r\nthe world was intercepted about the year 1406, when the seventeenth\r\nbishop attempted to reach his see, but was prevented by ice. Since\r\nthe beginning of the fifteenth century, these unfortunate colonists\r\nhave been of necessity left to themselves, and not having been heard\r\nof, are supposed to have perished; but whether they were destroyed\r\nby their enemies the Esquimaux, or perished for want of their usual\r\nsupplies, or were carried off by a destructive pestilence, as some\r\nhave imagined, is still matter of doubt. Various attempts have been\r\nmade by order of the Danish government for recovery of this country,\r\nand to ascertain the fate of these colonists, but hitherto without\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nAlter the voyages of Columbus, a new stimulus was offered to\r\nthe enterprising trader, and to those who might be desirous of\r\nprosecuting the task of discovery, and a Portuguese navigator, John\r\nVaz Costa Cortereal, about the year 1463 or 1464, tried the passage\r\nto India by the west, on a parallel far to the northward of that\r\npursued by Columbus. In this voyage the land of Newfoundland appears\r\nto have been seen. The same voyage was attempted by Sebastian Cabot,\r\na Venetian, in the year 1497, and by Gaspar Cortereal and Michael\r\nCortereal, sons of the previously named Costa. Both these brothers\r\nperished, and a third brother, who would have followed in search of\r\nthem, was prohibited from embarking by the king of Portugal.\r\n\r\nAn important voyage of discovery was that of sir Hugh Willoughby,\r\nin the year 1553, in which the coast now called Nova Zembla was\r\ndiscovered, and the Russian territory on the east side of the\r\nWhite Sea. In consequence of this expedition, a regular trade was\r\nestablished with Russia, which was accomplished under various\r\nprivileges. In the year 1556, further discoveries in the same quarter\r\nwere made by Stephen Burrough. Then followed the voyages of Martin\r\nFrobisher and John Davis; the latter in the year 1585. He proceeded\r\nalong the west side of Greenland, and then crossing an open sea to\r\nthe north-westward, discovered land in latitude 66° 40′, giving names\r\nto the different parts of the coast which has since been denominated\r\n_Cumberland Island_. In the course of this voyage, they met with a\r\nmultitude of natives, whom they found a very tractable people, and\r\nliberal in their mode of trafficking. In the following year, Davis\r\nprosecuted another voyage, but with no discovery of any consequence;\r\nand again also, for the third time, in the year following.\r\n\r\nAmongst several expeditions sent out by the Dutch, to explore a\r\npassage to India and China by the north-east, that of two ships,\r\nunder the pilotage of William Barentz, is the most memorable. It\r\nsailed from Amsterdam the 10th of May, 1596. After having discovered\r\nSpitzbergen, the two ships pursued different courses, and Barentz,\r\nwhile endeavouring to sail round Nova Zembla, became entangled in\r\nthe ice. They were, in consequence, compelled to winter in this\r\ndesolate and frozen country. “The journal of the proceedings of\r\nthese poor people,” as Mr. Barrow beautifully observes, “during\r\nthis cold, comfortless, dark, and dreadful winter is intensely and\r\npainfully interesting. No murmuring escapes them in their hopeless\r\nand afflicted situation; but such a spirit of true piety, and a tone\r\nof such mild and subdued resignation to Divine Providence, breathe\r\nthroughout the whole narrative, that it is impossible to peruse\r\nthe simple tale of their sufferings, and contemplate their forlorn\r\nsituation, without the deepest emotion.” Forcibly, indeed, does their\r\nnarrative illustrate the mind’s independence of external comforts,\r\nand the peace and joy to be derived from trust in God, and cordial\r\nsubmission to his appointments. Part of the sufferers made their\r\nescape in two open boats from this dismal country, in the following\r\nsummer, and after a perilous and painful voyage, of above one\r\nthousand one hundred miles, arrived in safety at Cola; but Barentz,\r\nwith some others, was overcome by the severity of the climate, and\r\nthe extraordinary exertions which he was obliged to make, and died.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1608, Henry Hudson was employed in search of a north-east\r\npassage; and, in 1610, in a voyage of discovery towards the\r\nnorth-west, in a vessel of fifty-five tons’ burden. It was on this\r\noccasion that he discovered the bay which bears his name, hauled\r\nhis ship on shore in a convenient situation, and wintered there.\r\nThey fell short of provisions, and the following summer the crew\r\nmutinied, and abandoned their captain, his son, and others of the\r\ncrew, to a most cruel fate. In 1616 was accomplished the remarkable\r\nvoyage of William Baffin, attended by discoveries of a most extensive\r\nnature in the bay which bears his name, which, though regarded with\r\nconsiderable doubt at first, have since been abundantly confirmed by\r\nthe labours of captain Ross and lieutenant Parry.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1822, the ship Baffin sailed from Liverpool, and reached\r\n80° north latitude without experiencing any frost; on the 27th April,\r\nwe arrived within ten miles of Spitzbergen, and were stopped in\r\nlatitude 80° 30′ by main ice. Afterwards, we encountered a most heavy\r\ngale, the thermometer falling in the space of sixteen hours 34°,\r\nbeing the most remarkable change I ever experienced in Greenland\r\nseas. On the 1st May, we advanced to only five hundred and sixty-six\r\nmiles’ distance from the Pole, and subsequently discovered the\r\neastern coast of Greenland, a continuation towards the north of\r\nthe coast on which the ancient Icelandic colonies were planted. We\r\nsurveyed and named various parts of this coast, to the extent of\r\nabout eight hundred miles, and found traces of inhabitants. It was\r\ninferred that Greenland is probably a great group of islands. The\r\nexpedition returned on the 18th September, in the same year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTIVE ACCOUNT OF SOME OF THE POLAR COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpitzbergen extends furthest towards the north of any country yet\r\ndiscovered. It is surrounded by the Arctic Ocean, or Greenland\r\nSea; and, though the occasional resort of persons drawn thither\r\nfor purposes of hunting and fishing, does not appear to have been\r\never inhabited. It lies between the latitudes 76° 30′ and 80° 7′\r\nnorth, and between the longitude of 9°, and, perhaps, 22° east;\r\nbut some of the neighbouring islands extend at least as far north\r\nas 80° 40′, and still further towards the east than the mainland\r\nof Spitzbergen. The western part of this country was discovered\r\nby Barentz, Heemskerke, and Ryp, in two vessels, fitted out of\r\nAmsterdam, on the 19th of June, 1596, who, from the numerous peaks\r\nand acute mountains observed on the coast, gave it the appropriate\r\nname of Spitzbergen, signifying “sharp mountains.” It was afterwards\r\nnamed _Newland_, or _King James’s Newland_, and then _Greenland_,\r\nbeing supposed to be a continuation towards the east of the country\r\nso-called by the Icelanders. It was re-discovered by Henry Hudson,\r\nan English navigator, in 1607, and four years afterwards became the\r\nresort of the English for the purpose of taking whales, since which\r\nperiod its shores have annually been visited by one or other of the\r\nnations of Europe, with the same object, to the present time. And\r\nthough the soil of the whole of this remote country does not produce\r\nvegetables suitable or sufficient for the nourishment of a single\r\nhuman being, yet its coasts and adjacent seas have afforded riches\r\nand independence to thousands.\r\n\r\nThis country exhibits many interesting views, with numerous examples\r\nof the sublime. Its stupendous hills, rising by steep acclivities\r\nfrom the very margin of the ocean to an immense height; its surface,\r\ncontrasting the native, protruding, dark-coloured rocks, with the\r\nburden of purest snow and magnificent ices, altogether constitute an\r\nextraordinary and beautiful picture.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the western coast is mountainous and picturesque, and\r\nthough it is shone upon by a four months’ sun every year, its snowy\r\ncovering is never wholly dissolved, nor are its icy monuments of\r\nthe dominion of frost ever removed. The valleys, opening towards\r\nthe coast, and terminating in the background with a transverse\r\nchain of mountains, are chiefly filled with everlasting ice. The\r\ninland valleys, at all seasons, present a smooth and continued bed\r\nof snow, in some places divided by considerable rivulets, but in\r\nothers exhibiting a pure unbroken surface for many leagues in extent.\r\nAlong the western coast, the mountains take their rise from within\r\na league of the sea, and some from its very edge. Few tracts of\r\ntable-land, of more than a league in breadth, are to be seen, and in\r\nmany places the blunt termination of mountain ridges project beyond\r\nthe regular line of the coast, and overhang the waters of the ocean.\r\nThe southern part of Spitzbergen consists of groups of insulated\r\nmountains, little disposed in chains, or in any determinate order,\r\nhaving conical, pyramidal, or ridged summits, sometimes round-backed,\r\nfrequently terminating in points, and occasionally in acute peaks,\r\nnot unlike spires. An arm of a short mountain chain, however, forms\r\nthe southern cape, or Point Look-out, but a low flat, in the form of\r\na fish’s tail, of about forty square miles in surface, constitutes\r\nthe termination of the coast. Other promontories, lying nearly north\r\nand south, are of a similar nature.\r\n\r\nTo the northward of Charles’s Island the mountains are more\r\ndispersed in chains than they are to the southward. The principal\r\nridge lies nearly north and south, and the principal valley extends\r\nfrom the head of Cross Bay to the northern face of the country,\r\na distance of forty or fifty miles. An inferior chain of hills,\r\ntwo or three leagues from the coast, runs parallel with the shore,\r\nfrom which lateral ridges project into the sea, and terminate in\r\nmural precipices. Between these lateral ridges, some of the largest\r\nicebergs on the coast occur. The most remarkable mountains I have\r\nseen are situated near Horn Sound, on Charles’s Island, and near\r\nKing’s Bay. Horn Mount, or Hedge-hog Mount, so-called from an\r\nappearance of spires on the top, when seen in some positions, takes\r\nits rise from a small tract of alpine land, on the southern side\r\nof Horn Sound. It has different summits, chiefly in the form of\r\nspires, one of which is remarkably elevated. I had an opportunity of\r\ndetermining its height in the year 1815. From one set of observations\r\nits altitude came out 1,457 yards, and from another 1,473 yards, the\r\nmean of which is 1,465 yards, or 4,395 feet. Another peak, a few\r\nmiles further to the northward, appeared to be 3,306 feet high.\r\n\r\nOn Charles’s Island is a curious peak, which juts into the sea. It\r\nis crooked, perfectly naked, being equally destitute of snow and\r\nverdure, and from its black appearance, or pointed figure, has been\r\ndenominated the Devil’s Thumb. Its height may be about 1,500 or\r\n2,000 feet. The middle hook of the foreland, as the central part\r\nof the chain of mountains in Charles’s Island is called, is a very\r\ninteresting part of the coast. These mountains, which are, perhaps,\r\nthe highest land adjoining the sea which is to be met with, take\r\ntheir rise at the water’s edge, and, by a continued ascent of an\r\nangle at first of about 30°, and increasing to about 45°, or more,\r\neach comes to a point, with the elevation of about six-sevenths of\r\nan English mile. This portion of the chain exhibits five distinct\r\nsummits, some of them to appearance are within half a league,\r\nhorizontal distance, of the margin of the sea. The points formed by\r\nthe top of two or three of them are so fine, that the imagination is\r\nat a loss to conceive of a place on which an adventurer, attempting\r\nthe hazardous exploit of climbing one of the summits, might rest.\r\nWere such an undertaking practicable, it is evident it could not be\r\neffected without imminent danger. Besides extraordinary courage and\r\nstrength requisite in the adventurer, such an attempt would need\r\nthe utmost powers of exertion, as well as the most irresistible\r\nperseverance. Frederick Martens, in his excellent account of a\r\n“Voyage to Spitzbergen,” undertaken in the year 1671, describes\r\nsome of the cliffs as consisting of but one stone from the bottom\r\nto the top, and as smelling very sweet where covered with lichens.\r\nIn Magdalen Bay, the rocks he describes as lying in a semicircular\r\nform, having at each extremity two high mountains, with natural\r\nexcavations, “after the fashion of a breastwork,” and, at their\r\nsummits, points and cracks like battlements.\r\n\r\nSome of the mountains of Spitzbergen are well-proportioned,\r\nfour-sided pyramids, rising out of a base of a mile, or a mile and\r\na half, to a league square; others form angular chains, resembling\r\nthe roof of a house, which recede from the shore in parallel ridges,\r\nuntil they dwindle into obscurity in the distant perspective. Some\r\nexhibit the exact resemblance of art, but in a style of grandeur\r\nexceeding the famed pyramids of the east, or even the more wonderful\r\ntower of Babel. An instance of such a regular and magnificent work of\r\nnature is seen near the head of King’s Bay, consisting of three piles\r\nof rocks, of a regular form, known by the name of the Three Crowns.\r\nThey rest on the top of the ordinary mountains, each commencing with\r\na square table, or horizontal stratum of rock, on the top of which\r\nis another of similar form and height, but of smaller area; this is\r\ncontinued by a third, a fourth, and so on, each succeeding stratum\r\nbeing less than the next below it, until it forms a pyramid of steps,\r\nalmost as regular, to appearance, as if worked by art.\r\n\r\nMany of the mountains of Spitzbergen are inaccessible. The steepness\r\nof the ascent, and the looseness of the rocks, with the numerous\r\nlodgments of ice in the cliffs, or on the sides of the cliffs,\r\nconstitute in many places insurmountable obstacles. Some hills,\r\nindeed, may be climbed with tolerable safety, but generally the\r\nattempt is hazardous. Many have fallen and lost their lives,\r\nespecially in the descent. When Barentz and Heemskerke discovered\r\nCherie Island, on their advance towards the north, they also\r\ndiscovered Spitzbergen, when some daring fellows among their sailors,\r\nwho had been collecting birds’ eggs, climbed a high, steep mountain,\r\nresembling those of Spitzbergen, and unexpectedly found themselves\r\nin a most perilous situation, for, on turning to descend, the way\r\nby which they had advanced presented a dismal assemblage of pointed\r\nrocks, perpendicular precipices, and yawning chasms. The view of the\r\ndanger of the ascent struck them with terror. No relief, however,\r\ncould be afforded them, and they were bewildered among the rocks.\r\nAt length, after a most anxious and painful exercise, in which they\r\nfound it necessary to slide down the rocks, while lying flat on their\r\nbodies, they reached the foot of the cliff in safety. Barentz, who\r\nhad observed their conduct from the shore, gave them a sharp reproof\r\nfor their temerity.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting appearances to be found in Spitzbergen,\r\nis the iceberg. These mountains of ice occur in the valleys adjoining\r\nthe coast of Spitzbergen, and other Polar countries. A little to the\r\nnorthward of Charles’s Island are the _Seven Icebergs_. Each of these\r\noccupies a deep valley, opening towards the sea, formed by hills of\r\nabout two thousand feet elevation on the sides, and terminated in\r\nthe interior by the chain of mountains, of perhaps three thousand\r\nto three thousand three hundred feet in height, which follows the\r\nline of the coast. They are exactly of the nature and appearance of\r\nglaciers, and there are many others of various sizes along the shores\r\nof this remarkable country.\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to form an adequate conception of these truly\r\nwonderful productions of nature. Their magnitude, their beauty,\r\nand the contrast they form with the gloomy rocks around, produce\r\nsensations of lively interest. Their upper surfaces are generally\r\nconcave; the higher parts are always covered with snow, and have\r\na beautiful appearance, but the lower parts, in the latter end of\r\nevery summer, present a bare surface of ice. The front of each, which\r\nvaries in height from the level of the ocean to four hundred or five\r\nhundred feet above it, lies parallel with the shore, and is generally\r\nwashed by the sea. This part, resting on the strand, is undermined\r\nto such an extent by the sea, when any way turbulent, that immense\r\nmasses, loosened by the freezing of water, lodged in the recesses\r\nin winter, or by the effect of streams of water running over its\r\nsurface and through its chasms in summer, break asunder, and, with a\r\nthundering noise, fall into the sea.\r\n\r\nOn an excursion to one of the Seven Icebergs, in July, 1818, I was\r\nparticularly successful in witnessing one of the grandest effects\r\nwhich these Polar glaciers ever present. A strong north-westerly\r\nswell having, for some hours, been beating on the shore, had loosened\r\na number of fragments attached to the iceberg, and various heaps\r\nof broken ice denoted recent shoots of the seaward edge. As we rode\r\ntowards it, with a view of proceeding close to its base, I observed\r\na few little pieces fall from the top, and, while my eye was fixed\r\non the place, an immense column, probably fifty feet square, and one\r\nhundred and fifty feet high, began to leave the parent ice at the\r\ntop, and leaning majestically forward with an accelerated velocity,\r\nfell with an awful crash into the sea. The water into which it\r\nplunged was converted into an appearance of vapour, or smoke, like\r\nthat from a furious cannonading. The noise was equal to that of\r\nthunder, which it nearly resembled. The column which fell was nearly\r\nsquare, and in magnitude resembled a church. It broke into thousands\r\nof pieces. This circumstance was a happy caution, for we might\r\ninadvertently have gone to the base of the icy cliff, from whence\r\nmasses of considerable magnitude were continually breaking.\r\n\r\nThis iceberg was full of rents as high as any of our people ascended\r\nupon it, extending in a direction perpendicularly downward, and\r\ndividing it into innumerable columns. The surface was very uneven,\r\nbeing furrowed and cracked all over. This roughness appeared to\r\nbe occasioned by the melting of the snow, some streams of water\r\nbeing seen running over the surface; and others, having worn away\r\nthe superficial ice, could still be heard pursuing their course\r\nthrough subglacial channels to the front of the iceberg, where, in\r\ntransparent streams, or in small cascades, they fell into the sea. In\r\nsome places, chasms of several yards in width were seen, in others\r\nthey were only a few inches or feet across. One of the sailors, who\r\nattempted to walk across the iceberg, imprudently stepped into a\r\nnarrow chasm, filled up with snow to the general level. He instantly\r\nplunged up to his shoulders, and might, but for the sudden extension\r\nof his arms, have been buried in the gulf.\r\n\r\nIcebergs are, probably, formed of more solid ice than glaciers, but,\r\nin every other respect, they are very similar. The ice of which they\r\nconsist is, indeed, a little porous, but considerable pieces are\r\nfound of perfect transparency. Being wholly produced from rain or\r\nsnow, the water is necessarily potable. Icebergs have, probably, the\r\nsame kind of origin as glaciers, and the time of their first stratum\r\nis nearly coeval with the land on which they are lodged. Though large\r\nportions may be frequently separated from the lower edge, or, by\r\nlarge avalanches from the mountain summit, be hurled into the sea,\r\nyet the annual growth replenishes the loss, and, probably, on the\r\nwhole, produces a perpetual increase in thickness.\r\n\r\nSpitzbergen and its islands, with some other countries within\r\nthe Arctic Circle, exhibit a kind of scenery which is altogether\r\nnovel. The principal objects which strike the eye are innumerable\r\nmountainous peaks, ridges, precipices, or needles, rising immediately\r\nout of the sea, to an elevation of three thousand or four thousand\r\nfeet, the colour of which, at a moderate distance, appears to be\r\nblackish shades of brown, green, grey, and purple; snow or ice, in\r\nstriæ, or patches, occupying the various clefts and hollows in the\r\nsides of the hills, capping some of the mountain summits, and filling\r\nwith extended beds the most considerable valleys; and ice of the\r\nglacier-form occurring at intervals all along the coast in particular\r\nsituations, as already described, in prodigious accumulations. The\r\nglistening, or vitreous appearance of the iceberg precipices, the\r\npurity, whiteness, and beauty of the sloping expanse, formed by the\r\nadjoining or intermixed mountains and rocks, perpetually “covered\r\nwith a mourning veil of black lichens,” with the sudden transitions\r\ninto a robe of purest white, where patches or beds of snow occur,\r\npresent a variety and extent of contrast altogether peculiar, which,\r\nwhen enlightened by the occasional ethereal brilliancy of the Polar\r\nsky, and harmonized in its serenity with the calmness of the ocean,\r\nconstitute a picture both novel and magnificent. There is, indeed, a\r\nkind of majesty, not to be conveyed in words, in these extraordinary\r\naccumulations of snow and ice in the valleys, and in the rocks\r\nabove rocks, and peaks above peaks, in the mountain groups, seen\r\nrising above the ordinary elevation of the clouds, and terminating\r\noccasionally in crests of everlasting snow, especially when you\r\napproach the shore under shelter of the impenetrable density of\r\na summer fog, in which case the fog sometimes disperses like the\r\ndrawing of a curtain, when the strong contrast of light and shade,\r\nbrightened by a cloudless atmosphere and powerful sun, bursts on the\r\nsenses in a brilliant exhibition. Here are to be beheld the glories\r\nof that one God, who is the Maker of all things in heaven and on\r\nearth, and who, unlike the false deities of heathen nations, is not\r\nconfined in his presence and government to any particular zone of\r\nthe earth’s surface, but illustrates the skill and excellence of his\r\ncreation, both in the beauties of icy and torrid climes.\r\n\r\nA remarkable deception, in the apparent distance of the land, is to\r\nbe attributed to the strong contrast of light and shade, and the\r\ngreat height and steepness of the mountains, displayed in these\r\nregions. Any strangers to the Arctic countries, however capable\r\nof judging of the distance of land generally, must be completely\r\nat a loss in their estimations when they approach within sight of\r\nSpitzbergen. When at the distance of twenty miles, it would be no\r\ndifficult matter to induce even a judicious stranger to undertake a\r\npassage in a boat to the shore, from the belief that he was within\r\na league of the land. At this distance, the portions of rock and\r\npatches of snow, as well as the contour of the different hills, are\r\nas distinctly marked as similar objects in many other countries,\r\nnot having snow about them, would be at a fourth or a fifth part of\r\nthe distance. Hence we can account, on a reasonable ground, for a\r\ncurious circumstance related in a Danish voyage, undertaken for the\r\nrecovery of the last colony in Greenland, by Mogens Heinson. This\r\nperson, who passed for a renowned seaman in his day, was sent out by\r\nFrederick II., king of Denmark. After encountering many difficulties\r\nand dangers from storms and ice, he got sight of the east coast of\r\nGreenland, and attempted to reach it; but, though the sea was quite\r\nfree from ice, and the wind favourable and blowing a fresh gale, he,\r\nafter proceeding several hours without appearing to get any nearer\r\nthe land, became alarmed, backed about, and returned to Denmark. On\r\nhis arrival, he attributed this extraordinary circumstance—magnified,\r\nno doubt, by his fears—to his vessel having been stopped in its\r\ncourse by “some loadstone rocks hidden in the sea.” The true cause,\r\nhowever, of what he took to be a submarine magnetic influence,\r\narose, I doubt not, from the deceptive character of the land, as to\r\ndistance, which I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nSpitzbergen abounds with deep bays and extensive sounds, in many\r\nof which are excellent harbours. From Point Look-out to Hackluyt’s\r\nHeadland, the west coast forms almost a series of rocks and foul\r\nground, few parts, excepting the bays, affording anchoring for\r\nships. Some of these rocks are dry only at low water, or only show\r\nthemselves when the sea is high, and are dangerous to shipping;\r\nothers are constantly above water, or altogether so below the surface\r\nthat they can either be seen and avoided, or sailed over in moderate\r\nweather without much hazard. On the east side of Point Look-out, a\r\nridge of stony ground stretches five leagues into the sea, towards\r\nthe south-east, on which the sea occasionally breaks.\r\n\r\nHorn Sound affords tolerable anchorage; within Bell Sound are\r\nseveral anchoring places and some rivers, and in Ice Sound, at Green\r\nHarbour, is good anchorage near the bank, in ten to eight fathoms’\r\nwater, or less. In several other places, when not encumbered with\r\nice, there is pretty good refuge for ships. On the north and east\r\nsides of Spitzbergen are several harbours, some of them very safe\r\nand commodious, but they are not so often free from ice as those\r\nwestward, and, therefore, have seldom been visited.\r\n\r\nThough the whale-fishers in the present age generally see the level\r\nof Spitzbergen every voyage, yet not many of them visit the shores.\r\nMy father has been several times on shore in different parts. My own\r\nlanding, for the first time in an Arctic country, was on Charles’s\r\nIsland, or Fair Forehead, at the north-west point. The number of\r\nbirds seen on the precipices and rocks adjoining the sea was\r\nimmense, and the noise which they made on our approach was quite\r\ndeafening. The weather was calm and clear when I went on shore, but\r\nsuddenly, a thick fog and breeze of wind commencing, obliged us to\r\nput off with haste, and subjected us to great anxiety before we\r\nreached the ship.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1818, I was several times on shore on the main,\r\nand landed once in the same season on the north side of King’s Bay.\r\nBeing near the land, on the evening of the 23rd of July, the weather\r\nbeautifully clear, and all our sails becalmed by the hills, excepting\r\nthe top-gallant sails, in which we had constantly a gentle breeze, I\r\nleft the ship in charge of an officer, with orders to stand no nearer\r\nthan into thirty fathoms’ water, and with two boats and fourteen men\r\nrowed to the shore. We arrived at the beach about half-past seven,\r\nP.M., and landed on a track of low flat ground, extending about\r\nsix miles north and south, and two or three east and west. This\r\ntable-land lies so low that it would be overflown by the sea, were it\r\nnot for a natural embankment of shingle thrown up by the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter advancing about half a furlong, we met with mica slate,\r\nin nearly perpendicular strata; and a little further on with an\r\nextensive bed of limestone, in small angular fragments. Here and\r\nthere we saw large ponds of fresh water, derived from melted ice and\r\nsnow; in some places, small remains of snow; and lastly, near the\r\nbase of the mountains, a considerable morass, into which we sank\r\nnearly to the knees. Some unhealthy-looking mosses appeared on this\r\nswamp, but the softest part, as well as most of the ground we had\r\nhitherto traversed, was entirely void of vegetation. This swamp had\r\na moorish look, and consisted, apparently, of black alluvial soil,\r\nmixed with some vegetable remains, and was curiously marked on the\r\nsurface with small polygonal ridges, from one to three yards in\r\ndiameter, so combined as to give the ground an appearance such as\r\nthat exhibited by a section of honeycomb. An ascent of a few yards\r\nfrom the morass, of somewhat firmer ground, brought us to the foot of\r\nthe mountain, to the northward of the Mitre Cape. Here some pretty\r\nspecimens of _Saxifraga oppositifolia_ and _Greenlandica_, _Salix\r\nherbacea_, _Draba alpina_, _Papaver alpina_, (of Mr. Don,) etc.,\r\nand some other plants in full flower, were found on little tufts of\r\nsoil, and scattered about on the ascent. The first hill rose at an\r\ninclination of 45°, to the height of about fifteen hundred feet, and\r\nwas joined on the north side to another of about twice the elevation.\r\nWe began to climb the acclivity on the most accessible side, at\r\nabout 10, P.M.; but, from the looseness of the stones, and the\r\nsteepness of the ascent, we found it a most difficult undertaking.\r\nThere was scarcely a possibility of advancing by the common movement\r\nof walking in this attempt; for the ground gave way at every step,\r\nand no progress was made; hence, the only method of succeeding\r\nwas by the effort of leaping or running, which, under the peculiar\r\ncircumstances, could not be accomplished without excessive fatigue.\r\nIn the direction we traversed, we met with angular fragments of\r\nlimestone and quartz, chiefly of one or two pounds’ weight, and a\r\nfew naked rocks protruding through the loose materials, of which the\r\nside of the mountain, to the extent it was visible, was principally\r\ncomposed. These rocks appeared solid at a little distance, but, on\r\nexamination, were found to be full of fractures in every direction,\r\nso that it was with difficulty that a specimen of five or six pounds’\r\nweight, in a solid mass, could be obtained. Along the side of the\r\nfirst range of hills, near the summit, was extended a band of ice and\r\nsnow, which, in the direct ascent, we tried in vain to surmount. By\r\ngreat exertion, however, in tracing the side of the hill for about\r\ntwo hundred yards, where it was so uncommonly steep that at every\r\nstep showers of stones were precipitated to the bottom, we found a\r\nsort of angle of the hill, free from ice, by which the summit was\r\nscaled.\r\n\r\nHere we rested until I took a few angles and bearings of the most\r\nprominent parts of the coast, when, having collected specimens of\r\nthe minerals, and such few plants as the barren ridge afforded, we\r\nproceeded on our excursion. In our way to the principal mountain\r\nnear us, we passed along a ridge of the secondary mountains, which\r\nwas so acute that I sat across it with a leg on each side as on\r\nhorseback. To the very top it consisted of loose sharp limestones,\r\nof a yellowish or reddish colour, smaller in size than the stones\r\ngenerally used for repairing high roads, few pieces being above a\r\npound in weight. The fracture appeared rather fresh. After passing\r\nalong this ridge about three or four furlongs, and crossing a\r\nlodgment of ice and snow, we descended by a sort of ravine to the\r\nside of the principal mountain, which arose with a uniformly steep\r\nascent, similar to that we had already surmounted, to the very\r\nsummit. The ascent was now even more difficult than before; we could\r\nmake no considerable progress, but by the exertion of leaping and\r\nrunning, so that we were obliged to rest after every fifty or sixty\r\npaces. No solid rock was met with, and no earth or soil. The stones,\r\nhowever, were larger, appeared more decayed, and were more uniformly\r\ncovered with black lichens; but several plants of the _Saxifraga_,\r\n_Salix_, _Draba_, _Cochlearia_, and _Juncus genera_, which had been\r\nmet with here and there for the first two thousand feet of elevation,\r\nbegan to disappear as we approached the summit. The invariably broken\r\nstate of the rocks appeared to have been the effect of frost. On\r\ncalcareous rocks, some of which are not impervious to moisture, the\r\neffect is such as might be expected; but how frost can operate in\r\nthis way on quartz is not so easily understood.\r\n\r\nAs we completed the arduous ascent, the sun had just reached the\r\nmeridian below the Pole, and still shed his reviving rays of\r\nunimpaired brilliancy on a small surface of snow, which capped the\r\nmountain summit. A thermometer, placed among stones in the shade\r\nof the brow of the hill, indicated a temperature as high as 37°.\r\nAt the top of the first hill, the temperature was 42°; and at the\r\nfoot, on the plain, 44° to 46°; so that, at the very peak of the\r\nmountain, estimated at three thousand feet elevation, the power of\r\nthe sun at midnight produced a temperature several degrees above the\r\nfreezing point, and occasioned the discharge of streams of water from\r\nthe snow-capped summit. In Spitzbergen, the frost relaxes in the\r\nmonths of July and August, and the thawing temperature prevails for\r\nconsiderable intervals on the greatest heights that have been visited.\r\n\r\nAs the capacity of air for heat increases as its density decreases,\r\nand that in such a degree that about every ninety yards of elevation\r\nin the lower atmosphere produces a depression of one degree of\r\ntemperature of Fahrenheit, we find that the elevation of some of\r\nthe Alps, Pyrenees, and mountains of Nepaul in the temperate zone,\r\nis such, that their summits are above the level where a temperature\r\nof thawing can at any time prevail; and though, by the application\r\nof this principle to the mountains of Spitzbergen, we find that\r\na thawing temperature may be occasionally expected, yet we do\r\nnot see how the prevalence of a thaw should be so continual as to\r\ndisperse the winter’s coat of snow, where the mean temperature of\r\nthe hottest month in the year must, on a mountain fifteen hundred\r\nfeet elevation or upward, probably be below the freezing point.\r\nPerhaps the difficulty is to be thus resolved. The weather, in the\r\nmonths of June, July, and August, is much clearer at Spitzbergen than\r\nit is near the neighbouring ice, where most of my observations on\r\ntemperature were made, and as such the temperature of these months\r\non shore must be warmer than at sea, and so much higher indeed as is\r\nrequisite for occasioning the dissolution of snow even on the tops of\r\nthe mountains.\r\n\r\nThe highest temperature I ever observed in Spitzbergen was 48°; but\r\nin the summer of 1773, when captain Phipps visited Spitzbergen,\r\na temperature of 58½° once occurred. Supposing this to be the\r\ngreatest, degree of height which takes place, it will require an\r\nelevation of 7,791 feet for reducing that temperature to the freezing\r\npoint, and hence we may reckon this to be about the altitude of the\r\nupper line of congelation, where frost perpetually prevails.\r\n\r\nThe prospect from the mountain which we ascended was most extensive\r\nand grand. A fine sheltered bay was seen on the east of us, an arm\r\nof the same on the north-east, and the sea, whose glassy surface was\r\nunruffled by the breeze, formed an immense expanse on the west;\r\nthe icebergs, rearing their proud crests almost to the tops of the\r\nmountains between which they were lodged, and defying the power of\r\nthe solar beams, were scattered in various directions about the\r\nsea-coast, and in the adjoining bays. Beds of snow and ice, filling\r\nextensive hollows, and giving an enamelled coat to adjoining valleys,\r\none of which, commencing at the foot of the mountain where we stood,\r\nextended in a continued line across the north, as far as the eye\r\ncould reach; mountain rising above mountain, until by distance they\r\ndwindled into insignificance; the whole contrasted by a cloudless\r\ncanopy of deepest azure, and enlightened by the rays of a blazing\r\nsun, and the effect aided by a feeling of danger, seated as we\r\nwere on the pinnacle of a rock, almost surrounded by tremendous\r\nprecipices; all united to constitute a picture singularly sublime.\r\n\r\nA gentle breeze of wind, that prevailed on the summit, much refreshed\r\nus, and strengthened us for the descent, which, though we had\r\nregarded it with indifference, we found really a very hazardous, and,\r\nin some instances, a painful undertaking. On the flat of land next\r\nthe sea, we met with the horns of reindeer, many skulls and other\r\nbones of sea-horses, whales, narwhales, foxes, and seals, and some\r\nhuman skeletons, laid in chest-like coffins, exposed naked on the\r\nstrand. Two Russian lodges formed of logs of pine, with a third in\r\nruins, were also seen; the former, from a quantity of fresh chips\r\nabout them, and other appearances, gave evidence of having been\r\nrecently inhabited. These huts were built upon a ridge of shingle,\r\nadjoining the sea. Among the shingle on the beach were numbers of\r\nnests, containing the eggs of terns, ducks, and burgomasters, and in\r\nsome of them were young birds. One of the latter, which we took on\r\nboard, was very lively, and grew rapidly, but having taken a fancy to\r\na cake of white lead, with which the surgeon was finishing a drawing,\r\nhe was poisoned. The only insect I saw was a small green fly, which\r\nswarmed upon the shingle about the beach. The sea along the coast\r\nteemed with a species of _helix_, with the _clio borealis_, and\r\nwith small shrimps. No animal of the class _Vermes_, and no living\r\nquadruped, was observed. Drift-wood was in some abundance, and, owing\r\nto the prevalence of a strong west wind, the shore was covered in\r\nmany places with deep beds of sea-weed.\r\n\r\nOf all the objects, however, that we met with in the course of our\r\nresearch, none excited so much interest as the carcase of a dead\r\nwhale, found stranded on the beach, which, though much swollen,\r\nand not a little putrid, fixed our attention, and diverted us from\r\nobjects of mere curiosity. It proved a prize to us of the value of\r\nabout £400, but was not secured without much labour. From a harpoon\r\nfound in its body, it appeared to have been struck by some of the\r\nfishers on the Elbe, and having escaped from them, it had probably\r\nstranded itself where we found it.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Spitzbergen is no doubt more disagreeable to human\r\nfeeling than that of any other country yet discovered. Extending\r\nto within ten degrees of the Pole, it is generally intensely cold,\r\nand even in the three warmest months, the temperature not averaging\r\nmore than 34½°, it is then subject to a cold of three, four,\r\nor more degrees below the freezing point. It has the advantage,\r\nhowever, of being visited by the sun for an uninterrupted period\r\nof four months in each year, thus having a summer’s day—if so\r\nlong an interval between the rising and setting of the sun may be\r\nso denominated—consisting of one-third part of the year. But its\r\nwinter is proportionably desolate; the sun, in the northern parts\r\nof the country, remaining perpetually below the horizon from about\r\nthe 22nd of October to about the 22nd of February. This great\r\nwinter night, though sufficiently dreary, is by no means so dark as\r\nmight be expected, God having, by wise and merciful arrangements,\r\ndistributed, with some approach to equality, the blessings of his\r\nprovidence. The sun, even during its greatest south declination,\r\napproaches within 13½° of the horizon, and affords a faint twilight\r\nfor about one-fourth part of every twenty-four hours. Added to\r\nthis twilight, the aurora borealis, which sometimes exhibits a\r\nbrilliancy approaching a blaze of fire—the stars, which shine with\r\nan uncommon degree of brightness—and the moon, which, in north\r\ndeclination, appears for twelve or fourteen days together without\r\nsetting—altogether have an effect, which, when heightened by the\r\nreflection of a constant surface of snow, generally give sufficient\r\nlight for going abroad; but, with the light afforded by the heavens,\r\nwhen the moon is below the horizon, it is seldom possible to read.\r\n\r\nThe first human beings who are known to have passed the winter\r\nin Spitzbergen, were two parties of seamen, belonging to English\r\nwhalers, who were left on shore by accident, on two different\r\noccasions; the first party, consisting of nine persons, all perished;\r\nbut the latter, composed of eight individuals, survived the rigours\r\nof the winter of 1630-1, and were all rescued. In the year 1633,\r\nseven volunteers, belonging to the Dutch fleet, were induced, by\r\ncertain emoluments, to attempt the same enterprise, and succeeded\r\nin passing the winter without sustaining any injury; but, on the\r\nsame hazardous experiment being tried by seven other persons the\r\nfollowing winter, they all fell a sacrifice to the ravages of the\r\nscurvy. Some Russians seem to have been the next to attempt this\r\nadventurous exploit, who, from being inured to a winter little less\r\nsevere at home, were enabled to accomplish it with more safety.\r\nFour men, who landed on an island on the east side of Spitzbergen,\r\nin the year 1743, and were deprived of the means of getting away\r\nby an unexpected calamity having overtaken the vessel to which they\r\nbelonged, remained there some years. Being exposed to uncommon\r\nprivations, they were led by their necessities to adopt some most\r\ningenious devices for providing themselves with food and raiment in\r\ntheir long and severe banishment. One of their number died; but the\r\nothers were relieved, after a stay of three years and six months, by\r\na vessel providentially driven on the coast, and restored to their\r\nfriends, enriched with skins and other produce of the country in\r\nwhich they had been exiled.\r\n\r\nIn modern times, people of the same nation have been in the habit of\r\nsubmitting to a voluntary transportation, with the object of making\r\nsome considerable advantage by the opportunities which such a measure\r\naffords them of hunting and fishing. These persons were formerly\r\nemployed in the service of the “White Sea Fishing Company;” but this\r\ncompany being now no longer in existence, the trade is conducted by\r\nprivate adventurers. They now proceed from Megen, Archangel, Onega,\r\nRala, and other places bordering the White Sea, in vessels of sixty\r\nto one hundred and sixty tons, some intended for the summer fishing,\r\nand others for the winter. The former put to sea in the beginning\r\nof June, and sometimes return in September; the latter sail about a\r\nmonth later, and wintering in the most secure coves of Devil Bay,\r\nBell Sound, Horn Sound, Cross Bay, Magdalen Bay, Love Bay, and\r\nothers, return home in the months of August or September of the\r\nfollowing year. The fishermen reside on shore during the winter, in\r\nhuts of the same kind as those used by the peasants in Russia, which,\r\nbeing taken out with them in pieces, are constructed with but little\r\ntrouble, in the most convenient situations. They build their stoves\r\nwith bricks, or with clay, found in the country. Their largest hut,\r\nwhich is erected near the place where their vessels or boats are\r\nlaid up, is from twenty to twenty-five feet square, and is used as a\r\nstation and magazine; but the huts used by the men who go in quest of\r\nskins, which are erected along shore, are only seven or eight feet\r\nsquare. The smaller huts are usually occupied by two or three men,\r\nwho take care to provide themselves from the store with the necessary\r\nprovisions for serving them the whole winter.\r\n\r\nI have visited several of these huts, some constructed of logs,\r\nothers of deals, two inches in thickness. During the stay of the\r\nhunters, they employ themselves in killing seals, sea-horses, etc.,\r\nin the water; and bears, foxes, deer, or whatever else they meet\r\nwith, on land. They are furnished with provisions for eighteen months\r\nby their employers, consisting of rye-flour for bread, oatmeal,\r\nbarley-meal, peas, salt beef, salt cod, and salt halibut, together\r\nwith curdled milk, honey, and linseed oil; besides which, they\r\nprocure for themselves _lion_-deer in winter, and birds in summer.\r\nTheir drink chiefly consists of a liquor called _nuas_, made from\r\nrye-flour and water; malt or spirituous liquors being entirely\r\nforbidden, to prevent drunkenness, as these persons, when they\r\nwere allowed it, drank so immoderately, that their work was often\r\naltogether neglected. For general purposes, they use spring water\r\nwhen it is to be had, or, in lieu of it, take water from lakes;\r\nbut, when neither can be got, they use melted snow. Their fuel, for\r\nthe most part, is brought with them from Russia, and drift-wood is\r\nused for the same purpose. The hunters defend themselves from the\r\nrigour of the frost by a covering made of skin, over which they wear\r\na garment called _kushy_, made of the skin of rein-deer, with boots\r\nof the same. A warm cap, called a _trucchy_, defends the whole head\r\nand neck, and part of the face; and gloves of sheep-skin, the hands.\r\nThey seldom travel far in winter, but the short excursions they have\r\noccasion to make they perform on foot, on snow-skates, and draw their\r\nfood after them on hand-sledges, but such as have dogs employ them in\r\nthis service. Their huts, in stormy weather, are often buried in the\r\nsnow, and in such cases they are obliged to make their way through\r\nthe chimney to get out. As an anti-scorbutic, they make use of a herb\r\nproduced in the country, a stock of which they generally provide\r\nthemselves with on the approach of winter, but sometimes they are\r\nunder the necessity of digging through the snow to obtain it. They\r\neither eat it without any preparation, or drink the liquor prepared\r\nfrom it by infusion in water. For the same purpose, they use a kind\r\nof raspberry, and a decoction of fir-tops.\r\n\r\nSpitzbergen does not afford many vegetables. It may be remarked,\r\nthat vegetation goes on uncommonly quick in this country. Most of\r\nthe plants spring up, flower, and afford seed in the course of a\r\nmonth or six weeks. They are chiefly of a dwarfish size. Some of the\r\nflowers are really pretty, but exhibit few colours, excepting yellow,\r\nwhite, and purple. The only plant I met with partaking of the nature\r\nof a tree, (a _salix_, allied to _S. herbacea_,) grows but to the\r\nheight of three or four inches. Although Spitzbergen is probably\r\nrich in minerals, yet so partial has been the examination of it that\r\nnothing of any value, excepting marble and coal, has yet been met\r\nwith. The remarks made concerning the appearances and productions of\r\nSpitzbergen apply in general to the islands adjacent. The principal\r\nof these are Moffen Island, Low Island, Hope Island, and Cherie\r\nIsland. The last abounds in sea-horses, bears, foxes, and sea-fowl.\r\nLead ore, in veins at the surface, has been found here, and specimens\r\nof virgin silver.\r\n\r\nBetween the latitudes of 70° 49′ and 71° 8′ 20″ north, and between\r\nthe longitudes 7° 26′ and 8° 44′, lies the island of Jan Mayen, said\r\nto have been first seen by a Dutch navigator of this name in the year\r\n1611. The west side, affording the greatest number of anchorages,\r\nhaving the best convenience for landing, and being better sheltered\r\nfrom the most frequent storms, was selected by the Dutch for their\r\n_boiling_ stations. I was successful, in my passage homeward, in\r\nthe year 1817, in effecting a landing. On approaching, the first\r\nobject which strikes attention is the peak of Beerenberg, which I\r\nsubsequently saw at a distance (by observation) of ninety-five to a\r\nhundred miles. It rears its icy summit to an elevation of 6,780 feet\r\nabove the level of the sea. After leaving the sea-shore, fragments\r\nof lava were seen at every step, and numerous undoubted marks of\r\nrecent volcanic action. On reaching a summit, estimated at 1,500 feet\r\nabove the sea, we beheld a beautiful crater, forming a basin of 500\r\nor 600 feet in depth, and 600 or 700 yards in diameter. The bottom\r\nof the crater was filled with alluvial matter to such a height that\r\nit presented a horizontal flat of an elliptical form, measuring 400\r\nfeet by 240. In the spring of the following year, some volcano was, I\r\nbelieve, in action in this neighbourhood, as I observed considerable\r\njets of smoke discharged from the earth at intervals of every three\r\nor four minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nAN ACCOUNT OF THE GREENLAND OR POLAR ICE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the inanimate productions of the Polar Seas, none perhaps excite\r\nso much interest and astonishment in a stranger as the ice in its\r\ngreat abundance and variety. The stupendous masses known by the name\r\nof icelands or icebergs, common to Davis’s Strait, and sometimes\r\nmet with in the Spitzbergen Sea, from their height, various forms,\r\nand the depth of water in which they ground, are calculated to\r\nstrike the beholder with wonder; yet the prodigious sheets of ice,\r\ncalled ice-fields, more peculiar to the Spitzbergen Sea, are not\r\nless astonishing. Their deficiency in elevation is sufficiently\r\ncompensated by their amazing extent of surface. Some of them have\r\nbeen observed extending many leagues in length, and covering an area\r\nof several hundreds of square miles, each consisting of a single\r\nsheet of ice, having its surface raised in general four or six feet\r\nabove the level of the water, and its base depressed to the depth of\r\nten to twenty feet beneath.\r\n\r\nThe ice in general is designated by a variety of appellations,\r\ndistinguishing it according to the size or shape of the pieces,\r\ntheir number or form of aggregation, thickness, transparency,\r\nsituation, etc. As the different denominations of ice will be\r\nfrequently referred to in the course of this work, it may be useful\r\nto give definitions of the terms in use among the whale-fishers for\r\ndistinguishing them.\r\n\r\n1. An _iceberg_, or ice-mountain, is a large insulated peak of\r\nfloating ice, or a glacier, occupying a ravine or valley, generally\r\nopening towards the sea in an arctic country.\r\n\r\n2. A _field_ is a sheet of ice, so extensive that its limits cannot\r\nbe discerned from the ship’s mast-head.\r\n\r\n3. A _floe_ is similar to a field, but smaller, inasmuch as its\r\nextent _can_ be seen. This term, however, is seldom applied to pieces\r\nof ice of less diameter than half-a-mile or a mile.\r\n\r\n4. _Drift-ice_ consists of pieces less than floes, of various shapes\r\nand magnitudes.\r\n\r\n5. _Brash-ice_ is still smaller than drift-ice, and may be considered\r\nas the wreck of other kinds of ice.\r\n\r\n6. _Bay-ice_ is that which is newly-formed on the sea, and consists\r\nof two kinds, common bay-ice and _pancake_-ice; the former occurring\r\nin smooth extensive sheets, and the latter in small circular pieces,\r\nwith raised edges.\r\n\r\n7. _Sludge_ consists of a stratum of detached ice crystals, or of\r\nsnow, or of the smaller fragments of brash-ice, floating on the\r\nsurface of the sea.\r\n\r\n8. A _hummock_ is a protuberance raised upon any plane of ice above\r\nthe common level. It is frequently produced by pressure, where one\r\npiece is squeezed upon another, often set upon its edge, and in\r\nthat position cemented by the frost. Hummocks are likewise formed\r\nby pieces of ice mutually crushing each other, the wreck being\r\nheaped upon one or both of them. To hummocks, principally, the ice\r\nis indebted for its variety of fanciful shapes, and its picturesque\r\nappearance. They occur in great numbers in heavy packs, on the edges,\r\nand occasionally in the middle of fields and floes, where they often\r\nattain the height of thirty feet or upwards.\r\n\r\n9. A _calf_ is a portion of ice which has been depressed by the same\r\nmeans as a hummock is elevated. It is kept down by some larger mass,\r\nfrom beneath which it shows itself on one side.\r\n\r\n10. A _tongue_ is a point of ice projecting nearly horizontally from\r\na part that is under water. Ships have sometimes run aground upon\r\ntongues of ice.\r\n\r\n11. A _pack_ is a body of drift-ice, of such magnitude that its\r\nextent is not discernible. A pack is _open_ when the pieces of ice,\r\nthough very near each other, do not generally touch, or _close_ when\r\nthe pieces are in complete contact.\r\n\r\n12. A _patch_ is a collection of drift or bay-ice, of a circular\r\nor polygonal form. In point of magnitude, a pack corresponds with a\r\nfield, and a patch with a floe.\r\n\r\n13. A _stream_ is an oblong collection of drift or bay-ice, the\r\npieces of which are continuous. It is called a _sea-stream_ when it\r\nis exposed on one side to the ocean, and affords shelter from the sea\r\nto whatever is within it.\r\n\r\n14. _Open-ice_, or _sailing-ice_, is where the pieces are so separate\r\nas to admit of a ship sailing conveniently among them.\r\n\r\n15. _Heavy_ and _light_ are terms attached to ice, distinguishable of\r\nits thickness.\r\n\r\n16. _Land-ice_ consists of drift-ice attached to the shore; or\r\ndrift-ice which, by being covered with mud or gravel, appears to have\r\nrecently been in contact with the shore; or the flat ice resting on\r\nthe land, not having the appearance or elevation of icebergs.\r\n\r\n17. A _bight_ is a bay in the outline of the ice.\r\n\r\n18. A _lane_ or _vein_ is a narrow channel of water in packs or other\r\nlarge collections of ice.\r\n\r\nWhen the sea freezes, the greatest part of the salt it contains is\r\ndeposited, and the frozen mass, however spongy, probably contains no\r\nsalt but what is natural to the sea-water filling its pores. Hence\r\nthe generality of ice, when dissolved, affords fresh water. As,\r\nhowever, the ice frozen altogether from sea-water does not appear\r\nso solid and transparent as that procured from snow or rain water,\r\nthe whale-fishers distinguish it into two kinds, accordingly as it\r\naffords water that is potable, or the contrary, as it appears to have\r\nbeen the product of fresh or salt water.\r\n\r\nWhat is considered as salt-water-ice appears blackish in the water,\r\nbut in the air is of a white or grey colour, porous, and in a great\r\nmeasure opaque, (except when in very thin pieces,) yet transmits the\r\nrays of light with a blue or blueish green shade. When dissolved,\r\nit produces water sometimes perfectly fresh, and at others saltish.\r\nThis depends, in a great measure, on the situation from whence it is\r\ntaken; such parts as are raised above the surface of the sea, in the\r\nform of hummocks, or which, though below the surface, have been long\r\nfrozen, appear to gain solidity, and are commonly _fresh_; whilst\r\nthose pieces taken out of the sea, that have been recently frozen,\r\nare somewhat salt.\r\n\r\nFresh-water-ice of the sailors is distinguished by its black\r\nappearance when floating in small pieces in the sea, and by its\r\ntransparency when removed into the air. Fresh-water-ice is fragile,\r\nbut hard; the edges of a fractured part are frequently so keen as to\r\ninflict a wound like glass. The most transparent pieces are capable\r\nof concentrating the rays of the sun, so as to produce a considerable\r\nintensity of heat. With a lump of ice, of by no means regular\r\nconvexity, I have frequently burned wood, fired gunpowder, incited\r\nlead, and lit the sailors’ pipes, to their great astonishment, all\r\nof whom, who could procure the needful articles, eagerly flocked\r\naround me, for the satisfaction of smoking a pipe ignited by such\r\nextraordinary means. Their astonishment was increased by observing\r\nthat the ice remained firm and pellucid, while the solar rays\r\nemerging from it were so hot, that the hand could not be kept longer\r\nin the focus than for the space of a few seconds. In the formation\r\nof these lenses, I roughed them out with a small axe, and then\r\nscraped them with a knife, polishing them merely by the warmth of\r\nthe hand, supporting them during the operation in a woollen glove.\r\nI once procured a piece of the purest ice, so large that a lens of\r\nsixteen inches diameter was obtained out of it; unhappily, however,\r\nthe sun became obscured before it was completed, and never made its\r\nappearance again for a fortnight, during which time, the air being\r\nmild, the lens was spoiled.\r\n\r\nAll young ice, such as bay-ice and light-ice, which form a\r\nconsiderable part of drift and pack-ice in general, is considered by\r\nGreenland sailors salt-water-ice; while fields, floes, bergs, and\r\nheavy-ice, chiefly consist of fresh-water-ice. Brash-ice likewise\r\naffords fine specimens of the latter, which, when taken out of the\r\nsea, are always found crowded on the surface with sharp points and\r\nconchoidal excavations.\r\n\r\nIce, when rapidly dissolved, continues solid as long as any remains,\r\nbut, when exposed to the air, at a temperature of only two or three\r\ndegrees above the freezing point, its solution is effected in a very\r\npeculiar manner. Thus, a large lump of fresh-water-ice, when acted on\r\nby such a process, if placed in the plane of its formation, resolves\r\nitself into considerable columns of a prismatic appearance. These\r\ncolumns are situated in a perpendicular position, almost entirely\r\ndetached, so that when a blow is struck with an axe, the whole mass\r\nfrequently falls to pieces. In the land icebergs, these columns are\r\noften of amazing magnitude, so as, when separated, to form floating\r\nicebergs.\r\n\r\nAll the ice floating in the sea is generally rough and uneven on the\r\nsurface, and during the greater part of the year covered with snow.\r\nEven newly-formed ice, which is free from snow, is so rough and soft\r\nthat it cannot be skated upon. Under water the colour of the ice\r\nvaries with the colour of the sea; in blue water it is blue, in green\r\nwater it is green, and of deeper shades in proportion to its depth.\r\nIn the thickest olive-green coloured water, its colour, far beneath\r\nthe surface, appears brownish.\r\n\r\nA description of the process of freezing from its commencement may\r\nnow be attempted. The first appearance of ice, when in a state of\r\ndetached crystals, is called by the sailors _sludge_, and resembles\r\nsnow when cast into water that is too cold to dissolve it. This\r\nsmooths the ruffled surface of the sea, and produces an effect like\r\noil in preventing breakers. These crystals soon unite, and would\r\nform a continuous sheet, but, by the motion of the waves, they are\r\nbroken in very small pieces, scarcely three inches in diameter. As\r\nthey strengthen, many of them coalesce, and form a larger mass.\r\nThe undulations of the sea still continuing, these enlarged pieces\r\nstrike each other on every side, whereby they become rounded, and\r\ntheir edges turn up, whence they obtain the name of _cakes_, or\r\n_pan-cakes_. Several of these again unite, and thereby continue to\r\nincrease, forming larger flakes, until they become perhaps a foot\r\nin thickness, and many yards in circumference. Every larger flake\r\nretains on its surface the impression of the smaller flakes of which\r\nit is composed, so that when, by the discontinuance of the swell, the\r\nwhole is permitted to freeze into an extensive sheet, it sometimes\r\nassumes the appearance of a pavement. But when the sea is perfectly\r\nsmooth, the freezing process goes on more regularly, and probably\r\nmore rapidly. During twenty-four hours’ keen frost, the ice will\r\nbecome an inch or two in thickness, and in less than forty-eight\r\nhours’ time capable of sustaining the weight of a man. Both this\r\nkind, and cake-ice, are termed bay-ice. In every opening of the main\r\nbody of ice at a distance from the sea, the water is always as smooth\r\nas that of a harbour; and in low temperatures, all that is necessary\r\nfor the formation of ice is still water. There is no doubt that a\r\nlarge quantity of ice is annually generated in the bays and amidst\r\nthe islands of Spitzbergen; which bays, towards the end of summer,\r\nare commonly emptied of their contents, from the thawing of the\r\nsnow on the mountains causing a current outwards. But this will not\r\naccount for the immense fields which are so abundant in Greenland.\r\nThese evidently come from the northward, and have their origin\r\nbetween Spitzbergen and the Pole.\r\n\r\nIce-fields constitute one of the wonders of the deep. They are often\r\nmet with of the diameter of twenty or thirty miles, and when in the\r\nstate of such close combination that no interstice could be seen,\r\nthey sometimes extend to a length of fifty or a hundred miles. The\r\nice of which they are composed is generally pure and fresh, and\r\nin heavy fields it is probably of the average thickness of ten to\r\nfifteen feet, and then appears to be flat, low, thin ice; but when\r\nhigh hummocks occur, the thickness is often forty feet and fifty\r\nfeet. The surface before the month of July is always covered with\r\na bed of snow, from perhaps a foot to a fathom in depth. This snow\r\ndissolves in the end of summer, and forms extensive pools and lakes\r\nof fresh water. Some of the largest fields are very level and smooth,\r\nthough generally their surfaces are varied with hummocks. In some,\r\nthese hummocks form ridges or chains, in others, they consist of\r\ninsulated heaps. I once saw a field which was so free from either\r\nfissure or hummock, that I imagined, had it been free from snow,\r\na coach might have been driven many leagues over it in a direct\r\nline, without obstruction or danger. Hummocks somewhat relieve the\r\nuniformity of intense light reflected from the surface of fields,\r\nby exhibiting shades of delicate blue in all the hollows, where the\r\nlight is partly intercepted by passing through a portion of ice.\r\n\r\nWhen the surface of snow on fields is frozen, or when the snow is\r\ngenerally dissolved, there is no difficulty in travelling over them,\r\neven without snow-skates or sledges. But when the snow is soft and\r\ndeep, travelling on foot to any distance is a work of labour. The\r\ntribe of Esquimaux, discovered by captain Ross, made use of sledges,\r\ndrawn by dogs, for conveying them across the rough land-ice, lying\r\nbetween the ships and the shore. A journey they performed with such\r\ncelerity, that captain Ross conjectured they could travel fifty or\r\nsixty miles a day. If such a distance were practicable on drift-ice,\r\noccurring near shore, it would be much more easy on the smoother ice\r\nof fields.\r\n\r\nThis term, _field_, was given to the largest sheets of ice by a Dutch\r\nwhale-fisher. It was not until a period of many years after the\r\nSpitzbergen fishery was established, that any navigator attempted to\r\npenetrate the ice, or that any of the most extensive sheets of ice\r\nwere seen. One of the ships resorting to Smeerenberg for fishery, put\r\nto sea on one occasion when no whales were seen, persevered westward\r\nto a considerable length, and accidentally fell in with some immense\r\nflakes of ice, which, on his return to his companions, he described\r\nas truly wonderful, and as resembling fields in the extent of their\r\nsurface. Hence the application of the term field to this kind of ice.\r\nThe discoverer of it was distinguished by the title of “field-finder.”\r\n\r\nFields commonly make their appearance in the months of May or June,\r\nthough sometimes earlier; they are frequently the resort of young\r\nwhales. Strong north and westerly winds expose them to the whalers\r\nby driving off the loose ice. The invariable tendency of fields is\r\nto drift to the south-westward, even in calms, which is the means of\r\nmany being yearly destroyed. They have frequently been observed to\r\nadvance a hundred miles in this direction within the space of one\r\nmonth, notwithstanding the occurrence of winds from every quarter.\r\nOn emerging from amidst the smaller ice, which before sheltered\r\nthem, they are soon broken up by the swell, are partly dissolved,\r\nand partly converted into drift-ice. The places of such are supplied\r\nby others from the north. The power of the swell in breaking the\r\nheaviest fields is not a little remarkable. A grown swell, that is\r\nso inconsiderable as not to be observed in open water, frequently\r\nbreaks up the largest fields, and converts them wholly into floes\r\nand drift-ice in the space of a few hours; while fields composed of\r\nbay-ice, or light-ice, being more flexible, endure the same swell\r\nwithout any destructive effort.\r\n\r\nThe occasional rapid motion of fields, with the strange effects\r\nproduced by such immense bodies on any opposing substance, is one of\r\nthe most striking objects the Polar seas present, and is certainly\r\nthe most terrific. They not unfrequently acquire a rotatory movement,\r\nwhereby their circumference attains a velocity of several miles per\r\nhour. A field thus in motion, coming in contact with another at\r\nrest, or more especially with another having a contrary direction\r\nof movement, produces a dreadful shock. A body of more than ten\r\nthousand millions of tons in weight, meeting with resistance when\r\nin motion, produces consequences which it is scarcely possible to\r\nconceive. The weaker field is crushed with an awful noise; sometimes\r\nthe destruction is mutual; pieces of huge dimensions and weight are\r\nnot unfrequently piled upon the top, to the height of twenty or\r\nthirty feet, while a proportionate quantity is depressed beneath.\r\nThe view of these stupendous effects in _safety_ exhibits a picture\r\nsublimely grand, but where there is danger of being overwhelmed,\r\nterror and dismay must be the predominant feelings. The whale-fishers\r\nat all times require unremitting vigilance to secure their safety,\r\nbut scarcely in any situation so much as when navigating amidst\r\nthese fields; in foggy weather, they are particularly dangerous,\r\nas their motions cannot then be distinctly observed. It may easily\r\nbe imagined, that the strongest ship is but an insignificant\r\nimpediment between two fields in motion. Numbers of vessels, since\r\nthe establishment of the fishery, have been thus destroyed; some\r\nhave been thrown upon the ice, some have had their hulls completely\r\ntorn open, or divided in two, and others have been overrun by the\r\nice, and buried beneath its heaped fragments. The Dutch have lost as\r\nmany as twenty-three sail of ships among the ice in one year. In the\r\nseason of 1684, fourteen of their ships were wrecked, and eleven more\r\nremained beset during the winter.\r\n\r\nIn the month of May, of the year 1814, I witnessed a tremendous\r\nscene. While navigating amidst the most ponderous ice which the\r\nGreenland Sea presents, in the prospect of making our escape from\r\na state of _besetment_, our progress was unexpectedly arrested by\r\nan isthmus of ice, about a mile in breadth, formed by the coalition\r\nof the point of an immense field on the north, with that of an\r\naggregation of floes on the south. To the north field we moored the\r\nship, in the hope of the ice separating in this place. I then quitted\r\nthe ship, and travelled over the ice to the point of collision, to\r\nobserve the state of the bar, which now prevented our release. I\r\nimmediately discovered that the two points had but recently met, that\r\nalready a prodigious mass of rubbish had been squeezed upon the top,\r\nand that the motion had not abated. The fields continued to overlay\r\neach other with a majestic motion, producing a noise resembling\r\nthat of complicated machinery, or distant thunder. The pressure was\r\nso immense, that numerous fissures were occasioned, and the ice\r\nrepeatedly rent beneath my feet. In one of the fissures, I found the\r\nsnow on the level three and a half feet deep, and the ice upwards of\r\ntwelve. In one place, hummocks had been thrown up to the height of\r\ntwenty feet from the surface of the field, and at least twenty-five\r\nfeet from the level of the water; they extended fifty or sixty yards\r\nin length, and fifteen in breadth, forming a mass of about two\r\nthousand tons in weight. The majestic, unvaried movement of the ice,\r\nthe singular noise by which it was accompanied, the tremendous power\r\nexerted, and the wonderful effects produced—were calculated to excite\r\nin the mind of the most careless spectator admiration of Him with\r\nwhom “the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted as the\r\nsmall dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the isles as a very\r\nlittle thing.”\r\n\r\nThe term _icebergs_ has commonly been applied to the glaciers\r\noccurring in Spitzbergen, Greenland, and other arctic countries. It\r\nis also as commonly extended to the large peaks, mountains, or islets\r\nof ice that are found floating in the sea. It is the latter kind of\r\nicebergs we purpose to describe.\r\n\r\nIcebergs occur in many places in the arctic and antarctic regions;\r\nsome of them of astonishing magnitude. In the Spitzbergen Sea,\r\nindeed, they are neither numerous nor bulky, compared with those\r\nof other regions; the largest I ever met with in this quarter not\r\nexceeding a thousand yards in circumference, and two hundred feet in\r\nthickness. But in Hudson’s Strait, Davis’s Strait, and Baffin’s Bay,\r\nthey occur of a prodigious size. Ellis describes them as sometimes\r\noccurring of the thickness of five hundred or six hundred yards.\r\nFrobisher saw one iceberg which was judged to be “near fourscore\r\nfathoms above water.” One berg is described by captain Ross (the\r\ndimensions of which were given in by lieutenant Parry[1]) as having\r\nnine unequal sides, as being aground in sixty-one fathoms, and as\r\nmeasuring 4,169 yards (paces) long, 3,689 yards broad, and fifty-one\r\nfeet high. The weight of this iceberg, taken at somewhat smaller\r\ndimensions, was estimated, by an officer of the Alexander, at\r\n1,292,397,673 tons. This amount, however, is greater than the truth,\r\nthe cubical inch of ice being taken at 240 grains, whereas it does\r\nnot exceed 231·5 grains.\r\n\r\nThe most abundant source of icebergs known in the arctic regions is\r\nBaffin’s Bay. From this remarkable sea they constantly make their\r\nway towards the south, down Davis’s Strait, and are scattered abroad\r\nin the Atlantic to an amazing extent. The banks of Newfoundland are\r\noccasionally crowded with these wonderful productions of the frigid\r\nzone; beyond which they are sometimes conveyed, by the operation of\r\nthe southerly under-current, as low as latitude 40° north, and even\r\nlower, a distance of at least two thousand miles from the place of\r\ntheir origin.\r\n\r\nIcebergs commonly float on a base which is larger in extent than the\r\nupper surface. Hence the proportion of ice appearing above water is\r\nseldom less in elevation than one-seventh of the whole thickness; and\r\nwhen the summit is conical, the elevation above water is frequently\r\none-fourth of the whole depth of the berg. Perhaps the most general\r\nform of icebergs is with one high perpendicular side, the opposite\r\nside very low, and the intermediate surface forming a gradual slope.\r\nWhen of such a form, captain Ross found that the higher end was\r\ngenerally to windward. Some icebergs have regular flat surfaces, but\r\nmost usually they have different acute summits, and occasionally\r\nexhibit the most fantastic shapes. Some have been seen that were\r\ncompletely perforated, or containing prodigious caverns, or having\r\nmany clefts or cracks in the most elevated parts, so as to give\r\nthe appearance of several distinct spires. On some icebergs, where\r\nthere are hollows, a great quantity of snow accumulates; others are\r\nsmooth and naked. The naked sides are often filled with conchoidal\r\nexcavations, of various magnitudes; sometimes with hollows the size\r\nof the finger, and as regular as if formed by art. On some bergs,\r\npools of water occur stagnant; on others, large streams are seen\r\noozing through crevices into the sea. In a high sea, the waves\r\nbreak against them as against a rock; and, in calm weather, where\r\nthere is a swell, the noise made by their rising and falling is\r\ntremendous. When icebergs are aground, or when there is a superficial\r\ncurrent running to leeward, the motion of other ice past them is so\r\ngreat that they appear to be moving to windward. Fields of ice, of\r\nconsiderable thickness, meeting a berg under such circumstances,\r\nare sometimes completely ripped up and divided through the middle.\r\nIcebergs, when acted on by the sun, or by a temperate atmosphere,\r\nbecome hollow and fragile. Large pieces are then liable to be broken\r\noff, and fall into the sea with a terrible crash, which, in some\r\nplaces, produces an echo in the neighbouring mountains. When this\r\ncircumstance, called _calving_, takes place, the iceberg loses\r\nits equilibrium, sometimes turns on one side, and is occasionally\r\ninverted. The sea is thereby put into commotion, fields of ice in the\r\nvicinity are broken up, the waves extend, and the noise is heard to\r\nthe distance of several miles; and sometimes the rolling motion of\r\nthe berg not ceasing, other pieces get loosened and detached, till\r\nthe whole mass falls asunder like a wreck.\r\n\r\nIcebergs differ a little in colour according to their solidity and\r\ndistance, or state of the atmosphere. A very general appearance\r\nis that of cliffs of chalk, or of white or grey marble. The sun’s\r\nrays reflected from them sometimes give a glistening appearance to\r\ntheir surfaces. Different shades of colour occur in the precipitous\r\nparts, accordingly as the ice is more or less solid, and accordingly\r\nas it contains strata of earth, gravel, or sand, or is free from\r\nany impurity. In the fresh fracture, greenish grey, approaching to\r\nemerald green, is the prevailing colour. In the night, icebergs\r\nare readily distinguished, even at a distance, by their natural\r\neffulgence; and in foggy weather, by a peculiar blackness in the\r\natmosphere, by which the danger to the navigator is diminished.\r\nAs, however, they occur far from land, and often in unexpected\r\nsituations, navigators require to be always on the watch for them.\r\nThough often dangerous neighbours, they have occasionally proved\r\nuseful auxiliaries to the whale-fishers. Their situation in a smooth\r\nsea is very little affected by the wind; under the strongest gale\r\nthey are not perceptibly moved, but, on the contrary, have the\r\nappearance of advancing to windward, because every other description\r\nof ice moves rapidly past them. From the iceberg’s firmness, it often\r\naffords a stable mooring to the ship in strong adverse winds, and the\r\nfisher likewise avails himself of it when his object is to gain a\r\nwindward situation more open. He moors under the lee of the iceberg,\r\nloose ice soon forces past, the ship remains nearly stationary, and\r\nthe wished-for effect seldom fails to result. Vessels have, however,\r\noften been staved, and sometimes wrecked, by the fall of their icy\r\nmooring; while smaller objects, such as boats, have been repeatedly\r\noverwhelmed, even at a considerable distance, by the vast waves\r\noccasioned by such events.\r\n\r\nAll ice becomes exceedingly fragile towards the close of the\r\nwhale-fishing season, when the temperate air thaws its surface,\r\nand changes its solid structure into a brittle mass of imperfectly\r\nattached columns. Bergs in this state being struck by an axe, for\r\nthe purpose of placing a mooring anchor, have been known to rend\r\nasunder, and precipitate the careless seaman into the yawning\r\nchasm; whilst, occasionally, the masses are hurled apart, and fall\r\nin contrary directions with a prodigious crash, burying boats and\r\nmen in one common ruin. The awful effect produced by a solid mass,\r\nmany thousands, or even millions, of tons in weight, changing its\r\nsituation with the velocity of a falling body, whereby its aspiring\r\nsummit is in a moment buried in the ocean, can be more easily\r\nimagined than described. Though a blow with an edge-tool on brittle\r\nice does not sever the mass, still it is often succeeded by a\r\ncrackling noise, proving the mass to be ready to burst from the force\r\nof internal expansion, or from the destruction of its texture by a\r\nwarm temperature. It is common, when ships moor to icebergs, to lie\r\nas remote from them as their ropes will allow, and yet accidents\r\nsometimes happen, though the ship ride at the distance of a hundred\r\nyards from the ice. In the year 1812, while the Thomas, of Hull,\r\ncaptain Taylor, lay moored to an iceberg in Davis’s Strait, a _calf_\r\nwas detached from beneath, and rose with such tremendous force, that\r\nthe keel of the ship was lifted on a level with water at the bow,\r\nand the stern was nearly immersed beneath the surface. Fortunately,\r\nthe blow was received on the keel, and the ship was not materially\r\ndamaged.\r\n\r\nFrom the deep pools of water found in the summer season on the\r\ndepressed surface of some bergs, or from streams running down their\r\nsides, the ships navigating where they abound are presented with\r\nopportunities for watering with the greatest ease and dispatch. For\r\nthis purpose, casks are landed upon the lower bergs, filled, and\r\nrolled into the sea; but, from the higher, the water is conveyed by\r\nmeans of a long tube of canvas, or leather, called a _hose_, into\r\ncasks placed in the boats, at the side of the ice, or even upon the\r\ndeck of the ship.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the icebergs that occur in Davis’s Strait, and on\r\nthe eastern coast of North America, notwithstanding their profusion\r\nand immense magnitude, seem to be merely fragments of the land\r\nicebergs, or glaciers, which exist in great numbers on the coast\r\nforming the boundaries of Baffin’s Bay. These glaciers fill immense\r\nvalleys, and extend, in some places, several miles into the sea; in\r\nothers, they terminate with a precipitous edge at the general line\r\nformed by the coast. In the summer season, when they are particularly\r\nfragile, the force of cohesion is often overcome by the weight of\r\nthe prodigious masses that overhang the sea; and, in winter, the\r\nsame effect may be produced by the powerful expansion of the water\r\nfilling any excavation, or deep-seated cavity, when its dimensions\r\nare enlarged by freezing, thereby exerting a tremendous force, and\r\nbursting the berg asunder. Pieces thus, or otherwise, detached,\r\nare hurled into the sea with a dreadful crash. When they fall into\r\nsufficiently deep water, they are liable to be drifted off the land,\r\nand down Davis’s Strait, according to the set of the current; but,\r\nif they fall into a shallow sea, they must remain until sufficiently\r\nwasted to float away.\r\n\r\nSpitzbergen is possessed of every character which is supposed to be\r\nnecessary for the formation of the largest icebergs; high mountains,\r\ndeep extensive valleys, intense frost, occasional thaws, and great\r\nfalls of sleet and snow; yet here a berg is rarely met with, and\r\nthe largest that occur are not to be compared with the productions\r\nof Baffin’s Bay. The reason of the difference between Spitzbergen\r\nand Old Greenland as to the production of icebergs is, perhaps,\r\nthis—that, while the sea is generally deep, and the coast almost\r\ncontinually sheltered by drift-ice at the foot of the glaciers, in\r\nBaffin’s Bay; in Spitzbergen, on the contrary, they usually terminate\r\nat the water’s edge, or where the sea is shallow, so that no very\r\nlarge mass, if dislodged, can float away, and they are, at the same\r\ntime, so much exposed to heavy swells, as to occasion dismemberments\r\ntoo frequently to admit of their attaining considerable magnitude.\r\n\r\nThat extensive body of ice which, with occasional tracts of land,\r\noccupies the northern extremity of the earth, and prevents all access\r\nto the regions immediately surrounding the Pole, fills, it appears,\r\non an average, a circle of above two thousand geographical miles\r\ndiameter, and presents an outline which, though subject to partial\r\nvariations, is found at the same season of each succeeding year to be\r\ngenerally similar, and often strikingly uniform. The most remarkable\r\nalteration in the configuration of the Polar ice on record, is that\r\nsaid to have taken place between Iceland and Greenland, in the\r\nbeginning of the fifteenth century, whereby the intercourse between\r\nthe Icelanders and the colonies in Greenland was interrupted; and,\r\nalthough many attempts have been made on the part of Denmark for the\r\nrecovery of these colonies, and for ascertaining the fate of the\r\ncolonists, they have not yet succeeded. In various countries, changes\r\nof climate, to a certain extent, have occurred within the limits\r\nof historical record; these changes have been commonly for the\r\nbetter, and have been considered as the effects of human industry, in\r\ndraining marshes and lakes, felling woods, and cultivating the earth;\r\nbut here is an occurrence which, if it be indeed true, is the reverse\r\nof common experience, and concerning the causes of which it is not\r\neasy to offer any conjecture.\r\n\r\nWith each recurring spring, the north Polar ice presents the\r\nfollowing general outline. Filling the Bays of Hudson and Baffin,\r\nas well as the Straits of Hudson, and part of that of Davis, it\r\nexhibits an irregular, waving, but generally continuous line, from\r\nNewfoundland or Labrador to Nova Zembla. From Newfoundland it\r\nextends in a northerly direction along the Labrador shore, generally\r\npreventing all access to the land, as high as the mouth of Hudson’s\r\nStrait; then, turning to the north-eastward, forms a bay near the\r\ncoast of Greenland, in latitude perhaps 66° or 67°, by suddenly\r\npassing away to the southward to the extremity of Greenland. The\r\nquantity of ice on the east side of Davis’s Strait being often small,\r\nthe continuity of its border is liable to be broken, so as to admit\r\nof ships reaching the land; and sometimes the bay of the ice, usually\r\noccurring in the spring, in latitude 66° or 67°, does not exist, but\r\nthe sea is open up the strait to a considerable distance beyond it.\r\nAfter doubling the southern promontory, or Cape Farewell, it advances\r\nin a north-eastern direction along the east coast, sometimes\r\nenveloping Iceland as it proceeds, until it reaches the Island of\r\nJan Mayen. Passing this island on the north-west, but frequently\r\ninclosing it, the edge of the ice then trends a little more to the\r\neastward, and usually intersects the meridian of London between the\r\n71st and 73rd degree of latitude. Having reached the longitude of 5°\r\nor 6° east, in some instances as far as 8° or 10°, in the 73rd or\r\n74th degree or north latitude, it joins a remarkable promontory, and\r\nsuddenly stretches to the north, sometimes proceeding on a meridian\r\nto the latitude of 80°, at others forming a deep sinuosity, extending\r\ntwo or three degrees to the northward, and then south-easterly to\r\nCherie Island, which, having passed, it assumes a more direct course\r\na little to the southward of east, until it forms a junction with the\r\nSiberian or Nova Zemblan coast.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter and spring months, the Polar ice seems closely to\r\nembrace the whole of the northern shores of Russia, to the eastward\r\nof Nova Zembla, and filling, in a great measure, Behring’s Strait\r\nand the sea to the northward of it, continues in contact with the\r\nPolar face of the American continent, following the line of the coast\r\nto the eastward, until it effects a junction with the ice in the\r\nSpitzbergen Sea, or in the great north-western bays of Hudson and\r\nBaffin, or is terminated by land yet undiscovered.\r\n\r\nThat remarkable promontory midway between Jan Mayen and Cherie\r\nIslands, formed by the sudden stretch of the ice to the north,\r\nconstitutes the line of separation between the east, or _whaling_,\r\nand west, or _sealing_, ice of the fishers; and the deep bay lying to\r\nthe east of this promontory, which may be called the _Whale-fisher’s\r\nBight_, invariably forms the only pervious track for proceeding\r\nto fishing latitudes northward. When the ice at the extremity of\r\nthis bay occurs so strong and compact as to prevent the approach\r\nto the shores of Spitzbergen, and the advance northward beyond the\r\nlatitude of 75° or 76°, it is said to be a _close season_, and, on\r\nthe contrary, it is called an _open season_ when an uninterrupted\r\nnavigation extends along the western coast of Spitzbergen to\r\nHackluyt’s Headland.\r\n\r\nThe place where whales occur in the greatest abundance is generally\r\nfound to be in 78° or 79° of north latitude, though, from the 72nd to\r\nthe 81st degree they have been met with. They prefer those situations\r\nwhich afford them the most secure retreats, and the course of their\r\nflight when scared or wounded is generally towards the nearest or\r\nmost compact ice. The place of their retreat, however, is regulated\r\nby various circumstances; it may sometimes depend on the quality or\r\nquantity of food occurring, the disposition of the ice, or exemption\r\nfrom enemies. Sometimes they seem collected within a small and\r\nsingle circuit; at others, they are scattered in various hordes\r\nand numerous single individuals over an amazing extent of surface.\r\nIn _close seasons_, though the ice joins the south of Spitzbergen,\r\nand thereby forms a _barrier_ against the fishing-stations, yet this\r\nbarrier is often of a limited extent, and terminates on the coasts\r\nof Spitzbergen in an open space, either forming or leading to the\r\nretreat of the whales. Such space is sometimes frozen over till the\r\nmiddle or end of the month of May, but not unfrequently free from\r\nice. The barrier here opposed to the fisher usually consists of a\r\nbody of ice, from twenty to thirty or forty leagues across in the\r\nshortest diameter. It is of importance to pass this barrier of ice as\r\nearly as possible in the season. The fisher here avails himself of\r\nevery power within his command. The sails are expanded in favourable\r\nwinds, and withdrawn in contrary breezes. The ship is urged forward\r\namongst drift-ice by the force of the wind, assisted with ropes and\r\nsaws. Whenever a vein of water appears in the required direction, it\r\nis, if possible, attained. It always affords a temporary relief, and\r\nsometimes a permanent release, by extending itself through intricate\r\nmazes, amidst ice of various descriptions, until at length it opens\r\ninto the desired place, void of obstruction, constituting the usual\r\nretreat of the whales.\r\n\r\nThe barrier which we have described, when it occurs, is regularly\r\nencountered on the first arrival of the Greenland ships in the\r\nmonth of April, but is generally removed by natural means as the\r\nseason advances. It is usually found separate from the land, and\r\ndivided asunder by the close of the month of June; and hence it is\r\nthat, however difficult and laborious may have been the ingress\r\ninto the fishing country, the egress is commonly effected without\r\nmuch inconvenience. In the month of May, the severity of the frost\r\nrelaxes, and the temperature generally approaches a few degrees of\r\nthe freezing point. The salt in the sea then exerts its liquefying\r\ninfluence, and destroys the tenacity of the bay-ice, makes inroads\r\nin its parts by enlarging its pores into holes, diminishes its\r\nthickness, and, in the language of the whale-fisher, completely rots\r\nit. Packed drift-ice is then liberated, and obeys the slightest\r\nimpulses of the winds or currents. The heavier having more stability\r\nthan the lighter, an apparent difference of movement obtains among\r\nthe pieces, and holes and lanes of water are formed to allow the\r\nentrance and progress of the ships. Bay-ice, though sometimes\r\nserviceable to the whalers in preserving them from the brunt of the\r\nheavy ice, is often the means of besetment, and hence the primary\r\ncause of every calamity. Heavy ice, many feet in thickness, and in\r\ndetached pieces of from fifty to a hundred tons’ weight each, though\r\ncrowded together in the form of a pack, may be penetrated in a\r\nfavourable gale with tolerable dispatch, whilst a sheet of bay-ice,\r\nof a few inches only in thickness, with the same advantage of wind,\r\nwill often arrest the progress of the ship, and render her in a few\r\nminutes immovable. If this ice be too strong to be broken by the\r\nweight of the boat, recourse must be had to sawing, an operation slow\r\nand laborious in the extreme.\r\n\r\nWhen the warmth of the season has rotted the bay-ice, the passage\r\nto the northward can generally be accomplished with a very great\r\nsaving of labour. Therefore it was the older fishers seldom or never\r\nused to attempt it before the 10th of May, and foreign fishers\r\nin the present day are in general late. Sometimes late arrivals\r\nare otherwise beneficial, since it frequently happens, in _close\r\nseasons_, that ships entering the ice about the middle of May obtain\r\nan advantage over those preceding them, by gaining a situation more\r\neligible, on account of its nearness to the land. Their predecessors,\r\nmeanwhile, are drifted off to the westward with the ice, and cannot\r\nrecover their easting. Hence, it appears, it would be economical\r\nand beneficial to sail so late as not to reach the _country_ before\r\nthe middle of May, or to persevere on the sealing stations until\r\nthat time. There are, however, some weighty objections to this\r\nmethod. Open seasons occasionally occur, and great progress may be\r\nmade, especially by superior fishers, before that time. A week or a\r\nfortnight’s solitary fishing, under favourable circumstances, has\r\nfrequently gained half a cargo. The change which takes place in the\r\nice, amidst which the whale-fisher pursues his object, is, towards\r\nthe close of the _season_, indeed astonishing. For, not only does\r\nit separate into its original individual portions, not only does\r\nit retreat in a body from the western coast of Spitzbergen, but,\r\nin general, that barrier of ice which incloses the fishing-site\r\nin the spring, which costs the fisher immense labour and anxiety\r\nto penetrate, by retarding his advance towards the north, and\r\nhis progress in the fishery, for the space of several weeks,\r\nspontaneously divides in the midst about the month of June, and, on\r\nthe return of the ships, is not at all to be seen. Then is the sea\r\nrendered freely navigable from the very haunts of the whales to the\r\nexpanse of the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\nOur remarks may now be directed, for a few pages, to the properties,\r\npeculiar movements, and drifting of the ice.\r\n\r\n1. The ice always has a tendency to separate during calms.\r\n\r\n2. Openings in packs and among fields, or floes, frequently break\r\nout, or disappear, without any apparent cause.\r\n\r\n3. Fields often open, close, and revolve, in the most extraordinary\r\nmanner, in calms as well as in storms.\r\n\r\n4. The amazing changes which take place amongst the most compact ice\r\nare often unaccountable.\r\n\r\n5. When speaking of the currents of the Spitzbergen Sea, it has\r\nbeen remarked that the Polar ice, in this situation, has a constant\r\ntendency to drift to the south-westward. Near Spitzbergen, indeed,\r\nthis tendency is not usually observed, because the influence of the\r\ntide, eddies, peculiar pressures, etc., sometimes produce a contrary\r\neffect; but, at a distance from land, its universal prevalence is\r\neasily illustrated.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of May, 1814, we entered with the ship Esk,\r\nof Whitby, a spacious opening of the ice, in latitude 78° 10′,\r\nlongitude 4° east, to a distance of ten or twelve leagues from the\r\nexterior, wherein we were tempted to stay, from the appearance of\r\na great number of whales. On the 9th of May, the ship became fixed\r\nin the ice, and, until the 16th, we lay immovable. A break of the\r\nbay-ice then appeared about half-a-mile from us, to attain which we\r\nlaboured with energy, and, in eight hours, accomplished a passage\r\nfor the ship. On the 20th, in attempting to advance, we endured a\r\nheavy pressure of the bay-ice, which shook the ship in an alarming\r\nmanner. After a fatiguing effort in passing through the midst of an\r\naggregation of floes against the wind, we reached a channel, which\r\nled us several miles to the south-eastward; and, on the 23rd, we\r\nlay at rest with four other ships. The day following, having sawn\r\na place for the ship in a thin floe, we forced forward between two\r\nlarge masses, where bay-ice, unconsolidated, had been compressed\r\ntill it had become ten or twelve feet thick. We were assisted by a\r\nhundred men from the accompanying ships, which followed close in\r\nour rear. After applying all our mechanical powers during eight\r\nor nine hours, we passed the strait of about a furlong in length,\r\nand immediately the ice collapsed, and riveted the ships of our\r\ncompanions to the spot. We advanced on various winding courses to\r\nthe distance of several miles, and then discovered a continuation of\r\nthe navigation between two immense sheets of ice, but the channel\r\nwas so narrow and intricate, that, for the distance of near a mile,\r\nit did not appear more than from ten to twenty yards in width. The\r\nprospect was, indeed, appalling; but, perceiving indications of the\r\nenlargement of the passage rather than the contrary, we advanced\r\nunder a press of sail, driving aside some disengaged lumps of ice\r\nthat opposed us, and shortly accomplished our wishes in safety. Here\r\nan enlivening prospect presented itself; to the extreme limits of\r\nthe horizon no interruption was visible. We made a predetermined\r\nsignal to the ships we had left, indicative of our hope of speedy\r\nrelease. In two hours, however, we were disappointed by meeting\r\nthe fields in the act of collapsing, and completely barring our\r\nprogress. As the distance across was scarcely a mile, and the sea, to\r\nappearance, clear beyond it, the interruption was most tantalizing.\r\nWe waited at the point of union, and, on the morning of the 26th of\r\nMay, our anxiety was happily relieved by the wished-for division\r\nof the ice. The ship, propelled by a brisk wind, darted through the\r\nstrait, and entered a sea, which we considered the termination of\r\nour difficulties. After steering three hours to the south-eastward,\r\nwe were concerned to discover our conclusions had been premature.\r\nAn immense pack opened on our view, stretching directly across our\r\npath. There was no alternative but forcing through it; we therefore\r\npushed forward into the least connected part. By availing ourselves\r\nof every advantage of sailing, where sailing was practicable, and\r\n_boring_ or drifting where the pieces of ice lay close together, we\r\nat length reached the leeward part of a narrow channel, in which we\r\nhad to ply a considerable distance against the wind. When performing\r\nthis, the wind, which had hitherto blown a brisk breeze from the\r\nnorth, increased to a strong gale. The ship was placed in such a\r\ncritical situation that we could not, for above an hour, accomplish\r\nany reduction of the sails; and while I was personally engaged\r\nperforming the duty of a pilot on the topmast-head, the bending\r\nof the mast was so uncommon that I was seriously alarmed for its\r\nstability. At length, we were enabled to reef our sails, and for\r\nsome time proceeded with less danger. Our direction was now east,\r\nthen north for several hours, then easterly, ten or fifteen miles;\r\nwhen, after eighteen hours of the most difficult and occasionally\r\nhazardous sailing, in which the ship received some hard blows from\r\nthe ice, after pursuing a tedious course nearly ninety miles, and\r\naccomplishing a distance on a direct north-east course of about forty\r\nmiles, we found ourselves at the very margin of the sea, separated\r\nonly by a narrow sea-stream. The sea was so great without, and the\r\nwind so violent, that we durst not hazard an attempt to force through\r\nthis remaining obstacle. After waiting about thirty hours, on the\r\nmorning of the 28th of May, the weather cleared, and the wind abated.\r\nThe sea-stream was now augmented to upwards of a mile broad. One\r\nplace alone was visible where the breadth was less considerable, and\r\nthrough it we accomplished our final escape into the open sea.\r\n\r\nI have thus been minute in the relation of our extrication from an\r\nalarming, though not very uncommon state of besetment, in order to\r\ngive a faint idea of the difficulties and dangers which those engaged\r\nin the whale-fishery have occasionally to encounter, as well as to\r\nillustrate the manner in which ships are carried away from their\r\noriginal situation by the regularity of the drift of ice to the\r\nsouth-westward. The life of the mariner is one always of great labour\r\nand peril, but in navigating these arctic seas he is exposed to\r\nsudden and peculiar dangers.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the title and contents of this volume may allure\r\nto its perusal some who look forward to exposure to dangers such\r\nas those which are here described. They surely will not deem it\r\nintrusive to be reminded that the most important preparation for\r\nsuch undertakings, as well as for the whole of life, is to surrender\r\nthe heart to that Saviour who has died to redeem his servants from\r\nguilt and ruin. The pardon and peace which he freely confers on all\r\nwho come to him, are the only safe comforts of a departing soul. It\r\nis his blood only that cleanses from all sin; it is his Spirit that\r\nrenews and sanctifies the mind; and whatever pain or accident may\r\nbefal the body, there can be “no condemnation” in time or in eternity\r\n“to them which are in Christ Jesus.” The message of God to man is the\r\noffer of a free salvation, through the death of his glorious Son.\r\nThis offer must determine the eternal condition of all to whom it is\r\nin God’s mercy revealed. “God so loved the world, that he gave his\r\nonly begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish,\r\nbut have everlasting life!” Reader, do you understand, and have you\r\naccepted, this gracious message?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Now sir John Ross and sir Edward Parry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS ON THE ATMOSPHEROLOGY OF THE ARCTIC REGIONS,\r\nPARTICULARLY RELATING TO SPITZBERGEN AND THE ADJACENT GREENLAND SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn treating of the subject of this chapter, our remarks shall, in\r\nthe first instance, relate to the _climate of the Arctic Regions\r\nand the general effects of cold_. In the autumn and spring seasons,\r\nthe climate of Spitzbergen and its adjacent sea is variable and\r\ntempestuous. The temperature passes through its extreme range, which,\r\nprobably, exceeds fifty degrees in the same season, or even in the\r\nsame month, with a rapidity unknown in countries situate within the\r\ntemperate zones. North, west, and east winds bring with them the\r\nextreme cold of the icy regions immediately surrounding the Pole,\r\nwhilst a shift of wind to the south-west, south, or south-east,\r\nelevates the temperature towards that of the neighbouring seas.\r\n\r\nAn arctic winter consists of the accumulation of almost everything\r\namong atmospheric phenomena that is disagreeable to the feelings,\r\ntogether with the privation of those bounties of Heaven with which\r\nother parts of the earth, in happier climates, are so plentifully\r\nsupplied. During the whole of the winter months, the cheering rays of\r\nthe sun are neither seen nor felt, and there are occasional storms of\r\nwind and snow.\r\n\r\nThe most severe cold, says Crantz, that occurs in Greenland, sets in,\r\nas in temperate climates, “after the new year; and is so piercing\r\nin February and March, that the stones split in twain, and the sea\r\nreeks like an oven.” On the return of the sun, the months of May,\r\nJune, and August, are even occasionally pleasant; but with July, and\r\npartially with June and August, the densest fogs prevail, which are\r\nmore depressing to the spirits than even intense cold.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the atmosphere, when the fogs prevail, is\r\ngenerally near the freezing point, and is not above three or four\r\ndegrees higher at midday than at midnight, and sometimes does not\r\nvary above a degree or two for several days together. But, in the\r\nspring and winter seasons, the temperature is subject to very great\r\nand rapid alterations, which are frequently simultaneous with the\r\ngreatest changes of pressure. This renders the thermometer a valuable\r\nappendage in the prognostication of the weather.\r\n\r\nThe great depression of temperature which takes place in the\r\nproximity of ice with a northerly wind, appears equally as\r\nconsiderable to the feelings in low as in high latitudes. As great\r\na degree of cold as ever I noticed in a series of twelve years’\r\nobservations (once excepted) was in latitude 71¼°, April 12, 1814,\r\nwhen the mean of three thermometers indicated zero; and, on the same\r\noccasion, during an interval of three days, the mean temperature was\r\nless than 5°. The wind in the mean time was continually blowing from\r\nthe north-eastward, generally blowing a gale, but sometimes moderate.\r\nOn the 25th of April, 1813, in latitude 8°, the thermometer fell to\r\n4°, during a hard gale from the north-east, but on account of the\r\nship being driven away from the ice it soon rose to 10° or 15°. The\r\neffect of the ice in reducing the temperature is so considerable,\r\nthat our proximity to it is often announced by the coldness before\r\nit can be seen. In this manner, the difference of a few leagues in\r\nposition sometimes produces a surprising increase of cold.\r\n\r\nThe Greenland sailors, being well defended from external cold by\r\na choice selection of warm clothing, generally support the lowest\r\ntemperature, after a few days’ habitude, without much inconvenience.\r\nWhen, however, its attacks are not gradual, as when a ship, which\r\nhas attained the edge of the ice, under a southerly gale, is exposed\r\nsuddenly to a northerly breeze, the change of temperature is so great\r\nand rapid, that the most hardy cannot conceal their uneasiness under\r\nits first impression. On one occasion, in the year 1814, there\r\nwas between the time of my leaving the deck at night and arising\r\nthe following morning an increase in the cold of about 20°. This\r\nremarkable change was attended with singular effects. The circulation\r\nof the blood was accelerated, a sense of parched dryness was excited\r\nin the nose; the mouth, or rather lips, were contracted in all their\r\ndimensions, as by a sphincter, and the articulation of many words was\r\nrendered difficult and imperfect; indeed, every part of the body was\r\nmore or less stimulated or disordered by the severity of the cold.\r\nThe hands, if exposed, would have been frozen in a few minutes, and\r\neven the face could not have resisted the effects of a brisk wind,\r\ncontinued for any length of time. A piece of metal, when applied to\r\nthe tongue, instantly adhered to it, and could not be removed without\r\nits retaining a portion of the skin; iron became brittle, and such\r\nas was at all of inferior quality might be fractured by a blow;\r\nbrandy, of English manufacture and wholesale strength, was frozen;\r\nquicksilver, by a single process, might have been consolidated; the\r\nsea, in some places, was in the act of freezing, and, in others,\r\nappeared to smoke, and produced, in the formation of _frost-rime_, an\r\nobscurity greater than that of the thickest fog.\r\n\r\nThe subtle principle of magnetism seemed to be, in some way or other,\r\ninfluenced by the frost, for the deck compasses became sluggish, or\r\neven motionless, while a cabin compass traversed with celerity. The\r\nship became enveloped in ice; the bows, sides, and lower rigging,\r\nwere loaded; and the rudder, if not repeatedly freed, would, in a\r\nshort time, have been rendered immovable. A considerable swell at\r\nthis time prevailing, the smoke in the cabin, with the doors closed,\r\nwas so intolerable, that we were under the necessity of giving free\r\nadmission to the external air to prevent it. The consequence was,\r\nthat, in front of a brisk fire, at the distance of a yard and a half\r\nfrom it, the temperature was 25°; water spilt on the table froze,\r\nand, indeed, congelation took place in one situation at the distance\r\nof only two feet from the stove. Hoar-frost, also, appeared in the\r\nsailors’ bed-cabins, arising from their breath, and was deposited\r\nupon their blankets.\r\n\r\nUnder such a temperature, the whale-fishery could not be prosecuted,\r\nfor nature could not sustain continued exposure to the pungent force\r\nof the wind. With a calm atmosphere, however, the sensible effects of\r\ncold are singularly diminished; the cold of zero then becomes equally\r\nsupportable with the temperature of 10, 15, or even 20 degrees, when\r\nimpressed by a brisk wind; hence, the sensations produced on the body\r\nbecome a very equivocal criterion for estimating the degree of cold.\r\n\r\nThe effect of cold in preventing the traversing of compasses, exposed\r\nto its influence, has been noticed by some navigators. As a remedy\r\nagainst this inconvenience, Ellis, in his voyage to Hudson’s Bay,\r\nsuggests the propriety of removing the compasses into a warm place,\r\nby which the needles speedily resume their activity. I have found,\r\nby experiments, that neither the attractive nor directive power of\r\nthe magnet suffers diminution by an increase of cold. There appears,\r\nhowever, to be an increase of friction, or the introduction of some\r\nunknown principle, which, when the degree of cold is very much\r\nincreased, occasions a diminution in the mobility of magnetic needles.\r\n\r\nMany remarkable effects of cold are related in the journals of Polar\r\nnavigators. Captain James, when wintering in Hudson’s Bay, latitude\r\n52° north, experienced such cold, that, on the 10th December, many\r\nof the sailors had their noses, cheeks, and fingers, frozen as white\r\nas paper. Ellis, who wintered in the same region, latitude 57° 30′,\r\nfound, by the 3rd of November, bottled beer, though wrapped in\r\ntow, and placed near a good, constant fire, frozen solid. Many of\r\nthe sailors had their faces, ears, and toes frozen; iron adhered\r\nto their fingers; glasses used in drinking stuck to the mouth, and\r\nsometimes removed the skin from the lips or tongue; and a sailor, who\r\ninadvertently used his finger for stopping a spirit-bottle in place\r\nof a cork, while removing it from the house to his tent, had his\r\nfinger fast frozen in the bottle, in consequence of which a part of\r\nit was obliged to be taken off to prevent mortification.\r\n\r\nA Hamburgh whaler, beset by the ice, near Spitzbergen, in the year\r\n1769, was exposed to great danger. The effect of the frost was such,\r\nthat the seams in the ship’s sides cracked with a noise resembling\r\nthe report of a pistol. These openings at first rendered the vessel\r\nvery leaky, but after she got free from the ice, and into a milder\r\nclimate, they again closed.\r\n\r\nIn the interesting narrative, by Pelham, of the preservation of eight\r\nseamen, who were accidentally left in Spitzbergen, in the year 1630,\r\nand wintered there, are some remarks on the effects of cold. The sea\r\nof the bay, where they took up their abode, froze over on the 10th\r\nof October. After the commencement of the new year, the frost became\r\nmost intense; it raised blisters in their flesh as if they had been\r\nburned with fire, and if they touched iron at such times it would\r\nstick to their fingers like bird-lime. Sometimes, when they went\r\nout of doors to procure water, they were seized in such a way by\r\nthe cold, that their flesh felt as sore as if they had been cruelly\r\nbeaten.\r\n\r\nThe effects of cold at Disco, as observed by M. Paul Egedé, on the\r\n7th January, 1738, and recorded by David Crantz, in his History of\r\nGreenland, are too striking to be omitted. “The ice and hoar-frost,”\r\nsays Egedé, “reach through the chimney to the stove’s mouth, without\r\nbeing thawed by the fire in the day-time. Over the chimney is an\r\narch of frost, with little holes, through which the smoke discharges\r\nitself. The doors and walls are as if they were plastered over with\r\nfrost, and, which is scarcely credible, beds are often frozen to the\r\nbedsteads. The linen is frozen in the drawers, the upper eider-down\r\nbed and the pillows are quite stiff with frost an inch thick, from\r\nthe breath.”\r\n\r\nThe terrific power of these mighty agencies of nature illustrate His\r\nperfections, who has all resources at his command, to minister to\r\nthe comfort of his servants, or the inevitable destruction of his\r\nenemies. To be hostile to the God of heaven and of earth, is surely\r\nthe height of folly as well as of ingratitude. “He sendeth forth his\r\ncommandment upon earth: his word runneth very swiftly. He giveth snow\r\nlike wool: he scattereth the hoar-frost like ashes. He casteth forth\r\nhis ice like morsels: who can stand before his cold?”\r\n\r\nIn these frigid regions, the scurvy becomes a very alarming disease,\r\nand many individuals have perished by it, who have attempted to\r\nwinter in Spitzbergen and neighbouring countries. It appears,\r\nhowever, probable, that this disease is not so much influenced by\r\nthe severity of the climate as by the use of improper aliment. An\r\nexcellent paper on this subject, by Dr. John Aikin, is published in\r\nthe Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester.\r\nIt affirms, that by the constant use of fresh provisions, the\r\noccasional use of oleaginous substances, together with frequent\r\nexercise, a warm dwelling, and a warm clothing, there would,\r\nprobably, be little danger in exposure to the severities of a\r\nSpitzbergen winter. Whenever I have had occasion to expose myself to\r\nsevere cold, I have found that the more I am heated the longer I can\r\nresist the cold without inconvenience. The warmth produced by simple\r\nfluids, such as tea or soup, is preferable to that occasioned by\r\nspirits. After the liberal use of tea, I have often sustained a cold\r\nten degrees at the mast-head for several hours without uneasiness. I\r\nhave frequently gone from the breakfast-table, where the temperature\r\nwas 50° or 60°, to the mast-head, where it was ten, without any other\r\nadditional clothing except a cap, yet I never received any injury,\r\nand seldom much inconvenience, from the uncommon transition.\r\n\r\nThe antiseptical property of frost is remarkable. Animal substances\r\nrequisite as food, of all descriptions, (fish excepted,) may be taken\r\nto Greenland, and there preserved any length of time, without being\r\nsmoked, dried, or salted. Beef, mutton, pork, and fowls, the latter\r\nneither plucked nor drawn, are constantly taken out from England,\r\nShetland, or Orkney, and preserved in this way. When used, the beef\r\nis best divided by a saw; it is then thawed in cold water, and,\r\nif cooked, when three, four, or five months old, will frequently\r\nappear as profuse of gravy as if it had been recently killed. A\r\nfurther antiseptical effect is produced by the cold on animal and\r\nvegetable substances, so as to preserve them, if they remain in the\r\nsame climate, unchanged for a period of many years. An instance\r\ncorroborative of this remark is given by M. Bleau, who, in his Atlas\r\nHistorique, informs us, that the bodies of seven Dutch seamen, who\r\nperished in Spitzbergen, in the year 1635, were found twenty years\r\nafterwards by some sailors, who happened to land about the place\r\nwhere they were interred, in a perfect state, not having suffered the\r\nsmallest degree of putrefaction. Wood, indeed, has been met with in\r\nSpitzbergen, which has resisted all injury from the weather during\r\nthe lapse of a century.\r\n\r\nOur remarks must now be directed to _meteorology_, and to an\r\ninvestigation of the temperature of the north Polar regions, and its\r\nconstant tendency to equalization.\r\n\r\nThough in a state of rapid improvement, the science of meteorology\r\nis acknowledged to be yet in its infancy. Before the discovery\r\nof the weight of the atmosphere by Torricelli, about the year\r\n1630, no means of registering its variations of pressure could be\r\nknown or practised. Hence we can have no very correct idea of the\r\nrelative temperature of climates in the present and remote periods,\r\nunless from occasional historical remarks of the formation of ice\r\nin particular lakes, rivers, or parts of the sea, or from the\r\ncapability of the earth for producing certain fruits or grain. In\r\nconsequence, however, of the use of the thermometer and barometer,\r\nmeteorology, as a science, has made considerable advancement. The\r\nrecords of phenomena, which these instruments indicate, have proved\r\nhighly useful. Professor Mayer has given us a formula for determining\r\nthe temperature of any situation on the globe, where observations\r\nhave not been made. Dr. Hutton has presented us with an ingenious\r\nand plausible theory of rain; and Kirwan, Humboldt, and others, have\r\nadvanced our knowledge of the climates of different countries. Dr.\r\nWells has investigated the phenomena of dew, and professor Leslie\r\nhas conducted profound researches on the relations of air to heat\r\nand moisture, and on the propagation of heat and cold through the\r\natmosphere to distant regions. By the invention, also, of several\r\ncurious and useful instruments, especially the hygrometer for the\r\nmeasurement of the dryness or dampness of the atmosphere, he has\r\ncontributed very largely to the advancement of meteorological\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the atmosphere in any particular region is one\r\nof those phenomena, which, however they may fluctuate, or whatever\r\nmay be their daily, monthly, or yearly variations, and however\r\nunequal and capricious these may be, will, on the average of numerous\r\ncorresponding periods, be found to be dependent on certain laws\r\ntending to produce equilibrium; so that the general results are\r\nremarkably uniform. When we experience particularly cold winters, or\r\nparticularly hot summers, we might suppose that the mean temperature\r\nof the years in which the former occur, would be greatly below,\r\nand that of years in which the hot summers occur, would be greatly\r\nabove, the general standard. But this will seldom be found to be the\r\ncase. In temperate climates of the northern hemisphere, the mean\r\ntemperature of any one year, derived from the mean of the daily\r\nextremes of heat and cold, or from any particular number of daily\r\nobservations, continued through the course of twelve successive\r\nmonths, seldom differs from the general mean temperature, as derived\r\nfrom the observation of a great, number of years, more than two or\r\nthree degrees. The mean temperature of any single month cannot be\r\nsupposed to be equally uniform; this, however, does not differ so\r\nwidely from the general mean of the month as might be expected.\r\n\r\nAs the mean annual temperature of a country is, therefore, probably\r\ngiven by one year’s observations only, to within two or three degrees\r\nof the truth, the mean of a period of eight or ten years will,\r\nprobably, come within one degree of the truth. By the comparison\r\nof the results of thermometrical observations, made in different\r\ncountries, with each other, tracing the changes of temperature,\r\nwhich appear with certain changes of latitude or situation, some\r\ningenious and philosophical men have endeavoured, by principles\r\nof analogy and induction, to determine the mean temperature of\r\nevery parallel of latitude from the Equator to the north Pole.\r\nThese calculations have been considered as near approximations;\r\nand, as long as observations were wanting, served for purposes of\r\ninvestigation, to complete the scale of the temperature of the globe.\r\nWhen we reach, however, the regions of perpetual ice, a remarkable\r\nanomaly is discovered, the mean temperature falling below the\r\nestimation in these tables at once 17°. From a series of observations\r\non the temperature, etc., of the Polar regions, conducted with care\r\nduring twelve successive voyages to the Greenland Seas, I am able to\r\ndeduce the following conclusions.\r\n\r\nThe mean temperature of the months of April, May, June, and July,\r\nare satisfactorily derived from the means of the latitudes and of\r\nthe observations of temperature; but the mean temperature of the\r\nwhole year, and of the winter months, wherein no observations in\r\nsuch high latitudes have yet been made, can only be ascertained by\r\nanalogy. From the examination of numerous thermometrical registers,\r\nparticularly one consisting of 54,750 observations, made in a\r\nsuccession of fifty years, at Stockholm, it would seem that the\r\ntemperature of the year in northern latitudes is indicated by that\r\nof the 27th to 28th of April. I have collated 656 observations,\r\nmade on 242 days, in nine different years, extending equally before\r\nand after the 27th of April, from which the mean temperature of the\r\nyear, in latitude 76° 45′, near the meridian of London, appears\r\nto be 18° 86′. Reducing all the monthly temperatures derived from\r\nmy observations to the parallel of latitude 78° north, by the\r\napplication of Mayer’s formula, and allowing for the fact that many\r\nof the observations of April were made at a considerable distance\r\nfrom the ice, I calculate the temperature of April, latitude 78°,\r\nto be 14° 23′, and the mean of the year in the same proportion\r\nexactly 17°. Having discovered, by observation chiefly, the mean\r\ntemperature of the months of April, May, June, and July, and the\r\nprobable mean temperature of the year in the icy regions adjoining\r\nSpitzbergen, I conceive it not difficult to calculate the temperature\r\nof the remaining months. The difference between the mean temperature\r\nof the year and that of July, is 21½° in Stockholm, and 20° near\r\nSpitzbergen. Finding not only that the difference of temperature\r\nbetween the mean of the year and July, near Spitzbergen, but that\r\nthe progressive increase of temperature from April to July, also,\r\nbore a strong analogy to the relative circumstances at Stockholm,\r\nI formed a scheme of decimals, connected with a simple formula, by\r\nwhich the same proportion of change, which has been observed to take\r\nplace every month at Stockholm, may be made very readily to apply to\r\nany other country, whence, situations and circumstances being nearly\r\nsimilar, the temperature of unobserved months may be calculated. The\r\ntemperature of January, latitude 78°, comes out—1°; that of February,\r\nO° 7′; March, 6° 1′; August, 34° 9′; September, 27° 8′; October, 18°\r\n5′; November, 9° 8′; and December, 3° 1′.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of every generalizing meteorologist, I\r\nmay, with some propriety, extend my observations to the probable\r\ntemperature of the north Pole, provided I can proceed on data, not\r\nmerely arbitrary or fanciful, but founded on observation and analogy.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, that professor Mayer’s theory for ascertaining\r\nthe temperature of every latitude, becomes exceedingly wide of the\r\ntruth when we approach the regions of perpetual ice, notwithstanding\r\nin most other situations on the sea, or bordering thereon, it holds\r\nsufficiently near. According to it, the mean temperature of latitude\r\n76° 45′, near the western coast of Spitzbergen, would have been 33°\r\n8′, instead of 18° 8′, as shown by my observations; and, according\r\nto it, the mean temperature of the Pole is reckoned to be about 31°.\r\nThe 15° difference between the observation and calculation must be\r\nconsidered as the frigorific effect of the ice, of which, if we can\r\nascertain the probable measurement at the Pole, we shall be able\r\nto modify Mayer’s calculation, so as to approximate to the mean\r\ntemperature. At the Pole, no wind could convey the mild influence\r\nof a temperate climate, because, from whatever direction it should\r\nblow, it must be cooled down by brushing over an extensive surface\r\nof ice; consequently, the full frigorific effect of the ice must be\r\ngreater in the Pole than in places situated at or near the borders\r\nof the ice. In a total period of 242 days, the temperature of the\r\nair was, by observation, found to be more or less influenced by the\r\nice during 173 days of that period. Hence, as 173 is to 15°, the\r\nanomaly occasioned by the mean temperature, so is 242 to 21°, which\r\nis the probable anomaly that may be expected when the temperature is\r\nalways influenced by the ice, or the anomaly which may be supposed\r\nto occur at the Pole. Now, if we deduct 21° from 31°, the calculated\r\ntemperature of the Pole, the actual mean temperature at the Pole will\r\nbe about 10°.\r\n\r\nConcerning the pressure of the atmosphere in Polar latitudes, I would\r\nremark, particularly in the winter and spring months, it is liable\r\nto sudden and very considerable variations, and a careful study and\r\nobservation of these is necessary to enable the watchful mariners to\r\nanticipate the approach of storms.\r\n\r\nThe following are the relations which, in Polar latitudes, I have\r\nbeen enabled to trace between the barometer and the weather:—\r\n\r\n1. A hard westerly gale, with snow, occasions the greatest depression\r\nof the mercury; and a light easterly wind, with dry weather, the\r\ngreatest elevation.\r\n\r\n2. The rising of the mercury foretells the subsidence of wind or\r\nrain, a change of wind or fine weather; and its falling, rain, snow,\r\nor a change or increase of wind.\r\n\r\n3. The mercury rising unusually high, and then becoming stationary,\r\nindicates, in the months of April and May, a continuance of fine\r\nweather; but in June or July, foggy weather.\r\n\r\n4. If, in the month of April, the mercury fall with some rapidity an\r\ninch or more, a storm will most certainly succeed, however contrary\r\nappearances may be, which will probably be the more severe in\r\nproportion as it approximates the east, and will frequently continue,\r\nwith unabated violence, for fifty or sixty hours.\r\n\r\n5. The rising of the mercury usually precedes the cessation of\r\na storm, but does not invariably determine the period of its\r\ncontinuance, as storms frequently blow for a day or two after the\r\nfirst rise of the mercury.\r\n\r\n6. Sudden and repeated fluctuations are indicative of unsettled\r\nweather; but the rapid fall of the mercury is no indication of a\r\nshort gale, though, in other regions, the reverse is said to be\r\nthe case; for, before storms that continue two or three days, the\r\nbarometer frequently falls an inch within twenty-four hours; and\r\nindeed, in a gale as long and as heavy as I almost ever witnessed,\r\nthe fall of the mercury was above an inch in twelve hours.\r\n\r\n7. Before very heavy storms, when the barometer falls uncommonly low,\r\nthe mercury seems to get below its natural level, and often rises two\r\nor three tenths of an inch as soon as the predicted storm commences;\r\nhence this first rise of the mercury is no indication whatever of an\r\nabatement of the wind.\r\n\r\n8. On account of the different states of the barometer in west and\r\neast winds, the usual level of the mercury, with a moderate wind at\r\nwest, not being much higher than with a gale at east, a change of\r\nwind from one of these quarters to the opposite may be accompanied\r\nwith the greatest alteration in the strength of the wind, without\r\nproducing any effect on the barometer.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the Greenland atmosphere corresponds in some degree\r\nwith the winter sky of Britain; the colour of the former is, however,\r\nof a deeper azure, and its transparency, when clear and free from icy\r\ncrystals, perhaps more perfect.\r\n\r\nFar within the borders of compact ice the atmosphere, in summer, is\r\noften cloudless, and the weather serenely pleasant, though cold.\r\nBut in the usual fishing-stations, and on the exterior of the ice\r\nin general, a clear sky is not frequent; nevertheless, when it does\r\noccur, its transparency is peculiarly beautiful. The sun sometimes\r\nsweeps two or three times round the Pole, without being for a moment\r\nobscured by a cloud. Objects the most remote may be seen perfectly\r\ndistinct and clear. A ship’s top-gallant-mast, at the distance of\r\nfive or six leagues, may be discerned when just appearing above the\r\nhorizon, with a common perspective glass; and the summits of some\r\nmountains are visible at the distance of sixty to a hundred miles.\r\nThis perfect clearness occurs most frequently before easterly winds;\r\nin general, however, especially in very cold weather, objects on the\r\nhorizon, when viewed with a high magnifier, appear affected with\r\na perpetual tremor; whence the contemplation of distant objects\r\nis accomplished as perfectly with a good pocket-glass as with the\r\nbest telescope. This tremulous motion is evidently produced by the\r\nquantity of delicate icy crystals which, in very low temperatures,\r\nare almost always seen floating in the air.\r\n\r\nThe general obscurity of the atmosphere, arising from clouds or\r\nfogs, is such, that the sun is frequently invisible during several\r\nsuccessive days. At such times, when the sun is near the northern\r\ntropic, there is scarcely any sensible variation in the quantity of\r\nlight from noon to midnight. Hence, when the sailors have been long\r\nabroad in the boats, or so fully engaged as to be unable to mark the\r\nprogress of time, the inquiry, whether it be day or night, is not\r\nunfrequent.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing remarkable in the appearance of the sun at midnight,\r\nexcepting that, when its altitude is very small, it may be viewed\r\nwith the naked eye, without producing any painful sensation; but when\r\nit is more than four or five degrees above the horizon, it generally\r\nappears as effulgent as with the same elevation in Britain. The force\r\nof the sun’s rays is sometimes remarkable. Where they fall upon the\r\nsnow-clad surface of the ice or land, they are, in a great measure,\r\nreflected, without producing any material elevation of temperature;\r\nbut when they impinge on the black exterior of a ship, the pitch on\r\none side occasionally becomes fluid, while ice is rapidly generated\r\non the other; or, while a thermometer, placed against the black\r\npaint-work on which the sun shines, indicates a temperature of 80° or\r\n90°, or even more, on the opposite side of the ship a cold of 20° is\r\nsometimes found to prevail.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable force of the sun’s rays is accompanied with a\r\ncorresponding intensity of light. A person placed in the centre of\r\na field or other compact body of ice, under a cloudless atmosphere\r\nand elevated sun, experiences such an extraordinary intensity of\r\nlight, that if it be encountered for any length of time, is not only\r\nproductive of a most painful sensation in the eyes, but sometimes\r\nof temporary, or even, as I have heard, of permanent blindness.\r\nUnder such circumstances, the use of green glasses affords a most\r\nagreeable relief. Some of the Indians of North America defend their\r\neyes by the use of a kind of wooden spectacles, having, instead of\r\nglasses, a narrow perpendicular slit opposite to each eye. This\r\nsimple contrivance, which intercepts, perhaps, nine-tenths of the\r\nlight that would reach a naked eye, prevents any painful consequences\r\nin the most intense reflection of light that ever occurs.\r\n\r\nThe constant light of the sun during the summer prevents the stars\r\nfrom being seen; and this, together with the frequency of cloudy\r\nor foggy weather, rarely admits a sight of the moon. Hence, the\r\nlongitude, which is of such essential importance in navigation, can\r\nseldom be determined by lunar observations. Chronometers, therefore,\r\nthough but little used by the whale-fishers, become of enhanced\r\nvalue; and even a good watch, well regulated, will, where the degrees\r\nof longitude are so very contracted, point out the meridianal\r\nsituation of the ship for short intervals, with a very tolerable\r\ndegree of accuracy.\r\n\r\nThough the air in the arctic seas is generally in a state of\r\ndampness, approaching to complete saturation, yet the absolute\r\nquantity of moisture cannot, when the cold is very excessive, be\r\nconsiderable. It is remarked, that vessels are less apt to rust here\r\nthan in any other climate; and this observation, if we consider the\r\nrelative humidity of the atmosphere as indicated by the hygrometer,\r\nis certainly correct; but though the air in the Polar regions is\r\ngenerally damp, yet it is probable there is no habitable situation in\r\nthe known world in which such a degree of actual dryness prevails, as\r\nin a house or in the cabin of a ship, well heated, when the external\r\nair is intensely cold. The wainscoting of the cabin of a ship in cold\r\nweather sometimes shrinks, in consequence of the uncommon dryness, as\r\nmuch as half an inch in a panel of about fifteen inches broad, being\r\nequal to one-thirtieth of the breadth; but, on returning to Britain,\r\nthe same panel expands again to almost its original dimensions.\r\n\r\nFew observations, comparatively, seem to have been made on the\r\nelectricity of the atmosphere, especially in high latitudes. Perhaps,\r\nsome trials that I made in the spring of 1818, on this subject, were\r\nthe first that have been attempted within the arctic circle. When\r\nin latitude 68°, I erected an insulated conductor, eight feet above\r\nthe maintop-gallant mast-head, connected by a copper wire with a\r\ncopper ball, attached by a silk string to the deck. The conductor\r\nconsisted of a slender tapering tube of tinned iron, terminated by a\r\npointed brass wire. It was fixed in an iron socket, supported by a\r\nlarge cylindrical piece of glass; which glass, by means of another\r\niron socket, was secured to the top of a long pole, elevated several\r\nfeet above the mast-head. A tin cone encompassed the bottom of the\r\nconductor, the mouth of which being downward, defended the rod of\r\nglass from getting wet, so as to injure its insulated property.\r\nThe conducting wire, being kept clear of the rigging of the ship,\r\nwas expected to exhibit in the ball, where it terminated, any\r\ndifference between the state of the electricity of the ship or sea\r\nand that of the atmosphere. The test of electricity was a Bennet’s\r\ngold-leaf electrometer, brought into contact with the ball; but\r\nthough trials were made for several successive days, from lat. 78° to\r\nlat. 75°, during clear, cloudy, and showery weather, not the least\r\nexcitation was ever observed. That the effect might be rendered more\r\nperceptible, the electrometer was well dried and warmed immediately\r\nbefore each experiment, without which, indeed, no excitation could be\r\nproduced in it, either with glass or sealing-wax. The nights being\r\nlight, the aurora borealis could not be seen; but on the evening of\r\nthe 20th of May, an appearance was observed, very much resembling the\r\naurora borealis, yet no signs of electricity were observed in the\r\nelectrometer applied to the conductor.\r\n\r\nThere are several phenomena of the atmosphere dependent on reflection\r\nand refraction, deserving of notice. _Ice-blinks_ have been already\r\nmentioned, when speaking of the ice. Under certain circumstances, all\r\nobjects seen on the horizon seem to be lifted above it a distance\r\nof two to four, or more, minutes of altitude, or so far extended in\r\nheight above their natural dimensions. Ice, land, ships, boats, and\r\nother objects, when thus enlarged and elevated, are said to _loom_.\r\nThe lower part of _looming_ objects are sometimes connected with the\r\nsensible horizon by an apparent fibrous or columnar extension of\r\ntheir parts, which columns are always perpendicular to the horizon;\r\nat other times, they appear to be quite lifted into the air, a void\r\nspace being seen between them and the horizon. This phenomenon is\r\nobserved most frequently on, or before, an easterly wind, and is\r\ngenerally considered as indicative of such.\r\n\r\nA most extraordinary appearance of the Foreland, or Charles’s Island,\r\nSpitzbergen, occurred on the 16th of July, 1814. While sailing to the\r\nsouthward, along the coast, with an easterly wind, I observed what\r\nappeared to be a mountain, in the form of a slender, but elevated,\r\nmonument. I was surprised that I had never seen it before, and\r\nwas more astonished when I saw, not far distant, a prodigious and\r\nperfect arch thrown across a valley, of above a league in breadth.\r\nThe neighbouring mountains disclosed the cause, by exhibiting an\r\nunnatural elevation with the columnar structure of looming objects.\r\nPresently, the scene was changed, the mountains along the whole coast\r\nassumed the most fantastical forms; the appearance of castles, with\r\nlofty spires, towers, and battlements, would, in a few minutes, be\r\nconverted into a vast arch or romantic bridge. These varied, and\r\nsometimes beautiful, metamorphoses naturally suggested the reality\r\nof fairy descriptions; for the air was perfectly transparent; the\r\ncontrast of snow and rocks was quite distinct; even in the substance\r\nof the most uncommon phantasms, though examined with a powerful\r\ntelescope, and every object deemed to possess every possible\r\nstability. I never before observed a phenomenon so varied or so\r\namusing. The land was not alone affected by this peculiar refraction,\r\nsince every object between the north-east and south-east points of\r\nthe compass was, more or less, deformed by it. A mass of ice on\r\nthe horizon appeared of the height of a cliff, and the prismatic\r\nstructure of its front suggested the idea of basaltic columns. It\r\nmay be remarked, that these phenomena took place on a clear evening,\r\nafter an uncommonly warm afternoon.\r\n\r\nI observed many other peculiar effects of refraction. Such phenomena\r\nare frequent on the commencement or approach of easterly winds,\r\nand are probably occasioned by the commixture, near the surface of\r\nthe land or sea, of two streams of air of different temperatures,\r\nso as to occasion an irregular deposition of imperfectly condensed\r\nvapour, which, when passing the verge of the horizon, produced these\r\nappearances.\r\n\r\n_Parhelia_, mock suns, and _corona_, haloes, are perhaps not so\r\nfrequent in Greenland as in some parts of America. I do not recollect\r\nto have observed them more than thrice. In the first instance, I did\r\nnot minutely notice the particulars. I recollect, however, there were\r\ntwo or three parhelia, and four or five coloured circles, some of\r\nwhich almost equalled in their colours the brilliancy of the rainbow.\r\nOn the second occasion, several parhelia were succeeded by a lunar\r\nhalo, together with the aurora borealis, and proved the harbingers\r\nof a tremendous tempest. The last phenomenon of the kind which I\r\nsaw, consisted of a large circle of luminous whiteness, passing\r\nthrough the centre of the sun, in a direction nearly parallel with\r\nthe horizon, intersected in various places with coloured circles of\r\nsmaller dimensions.\r\n\r\n_Rainbows_ are common in these regions, but the _fog-bow_, or\r\n_fog-circle_, is more rarely observed, and is entitled to our\r\nattention. It is a circle depicted on the fog, which prevails in\r\nthe Polar seas, at certain seasons, resting upon the surface of the\r\nwater, and seldom reaching to a considerable height. On the 19th\r\nJuly, 1813, I observed one of about 30° diameter, with bands of vivid\r\ncolours depicted on the fog. The centre of the circle was in a line\r\ndrawn from the sun, through the point of vision, until it met the\r\nvisible vapour in a situation exactly opposite to the sun. The lower\r\npart of the circle descended beneath my feet to the side of the ship,\r\nand although it could not be a hundred feet from the eye, it was\r\nperfect, and the colours distinct. The centre of the coloured circle\r\nwas distinguished by my own shadow, the head of which, enveloped by\r\na halo, was most conspicuously portrayed. I remained a long time\r\ncontemplating the beautiful phenomenon before me.\r\n\r\nIn the phenomena of the winds, which I am now about to describe, I\r\ncannot be so precise as I have been in my observations on atmospheric\r\ntemperature and pressure; being able to give a correct idea only\r\nof their peculiarities and direction, whilst their relative force,\r\nfounded on conjecture, I am unable to express otherwise than in the\r\nphraseology of the mariner, which, it must be allowed, is somewhat\r\nambiguous.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as we recede from the equator, we find the winds\r\nbecome more variable, irregular, and partial. Storms and calms,\r\nin the northern regions, repeatedly alternate, without warning or\r\nprogression; forcible winds blow at one place, when, at the distance\r\nof a few leagues, gentle breezes prevail; a storm from the south, on\r\none hand, exhausts its impetuosity upon the gentle breeze, blowing\r\nfrom off the ice on the other, without prevailing in the least;\r\nships, within the circle of the horizon, may be seen enduring every\r\nvariety of wind and weather at the same moment; come becalmed, and\r\ntossing about by the violence of the waves; some, under close-reefed\r\ntopsails, labouring under the force of a storm; and others, flying\r\nunder gentle breezes, from quarters as diverse as the cardinal\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThe most general preliminaries to _sudden storms_ are perfect calms;\r\ncuriously variable breezes, with strong squalls; singular agitation\r\nof the sea, together with thick snow, which often changes from flakes\r\nto powder, and falls in such profusion, as to occasion an astonishing\r\ngloominess and obscurity in the atmosphere. If the snow clear away,\r\nthe gale is often at hand, whilst a luminousness on the horizon,\r\nresembling the ice-blink, sometimes points out its direction, and\r\na noise in the upper regions of the air announces its immediate\r\napproach. In this variable and occasionally tempestuous climate,\r\nthe value of the barometer is satisfactorily proved. My father once\r\nremoved his ship from a most dangerous bight in the main ice, where\r\nshe would probably have been lost, had she remained a few moments\r\nlonger, in consequence of his having heard the rushing of a storm in\r\nthe air, while at the mast-head. Before the ship was out of danger,\r\na heavy gale commenced, but the sails being set, and the ship under\r\ncommand, she was extricated from the perilous situation. From this\r\ncircumstance, he imagined that sudden storms frequently commence at\r\nsome height in the atmosphere, and gradually descend to the surface.\r\n_Intermitting gales_ are almost equally common with sudden storms,\r\nand variable winds prevail, in an extraordinary degree, in the frigid\r\nzone. The winds, indeed, among ice, are generally unsteady in their\r\ndirection, and attended with strong gusts or squalls, particularly\r\nin very cold weather, and towards the termination of a storm. This\r\nvariableness, being the effect of the unequal temperature of the ice\r\nand water, is curious, but the phenomenon that is most calculated to\r\nexcite surprise is, that several distinct, and even opposite winds,\r\nwith the force, in many instances, of a fresh gale, will occasionally\r\nprevail at the same moment of time, within the range of the horizon.\r\nThe situation in which this circumstance occurs, would appear to be\r\nthe point where conflicting winds contend for the superiority; and\r\nas, in some instances, their forces are effectually balanced, the\r\nwinds, which simultaneously blow from the southward and northward, or\r\nfrom the eastward and westward, have their energies almost destroyed\r\nat the place of combination. Thus it sometimes happens that ships,\r\nwithin sight of each other, will, at the same period of time,\r\nexperience every variety of weather, from calm to storm, from fair\r\nweather to thickest snow, together with several distinct and contrary\r\ncurrents of wind.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 30th of April, 1810, the ship Resolution—in\r\nwhich I served in the capacity of chief-mate, or harpooner—was,\r\nduring thick showers of snow, sailing by the edge of a stream of ice,\r\nwith the wind from the north-westward. About ten, A.M., the snow\r\nabated, and several ships were seen within the distance of three or\r\nfour miles. As all of these ships were sailing “on a wind,” it was\r\neasy to ascertain the direction of the wind where they were, and\r\ncurious to observe its variableness. Two ships, bearing north-east\r\nfrom us, had the wind at north-east; two, bearing east, had east or\r\neast-north-east; two, bearing south-east, had the wind at south-east;\r\nwhile, with us, it blew from the north-west. In each of these\r\nsituations a fresh breeze prevailed; but in some situations, where\r\nthere happened to be no ships, there appeared to be no wind at all.\r\nThe clouds above us, at the time, we’re constantly changing their\r\nforms. Showers of snow were seen in various places at a distance.\r\n\r\nInstances of _local storms_ are not uncommon in temperate climates,\r\nbut in the arctic regions they are frequent and striking. Their\r\nlocality is such, that a calm may occur when a storm is expected and\r\nactually does prevail at a short distance, so that the indication of\r\nthe barometer may appear to be erroneous. In such cases, however, the\r\nreality of the storm is often proved by the agitation of the sea.\r\nSwells from various quarters make their appearance, and frequently\r\nprevail at the same time. My father, whose opportunities of\r\nobservation have been very numerous, relates the following instance\r\nof the locality of a storm. When commanding the ship Henrietta, he\r\nwas on one occasion navigating the Greenland Sea during a tedious\r\ngale of wind, accompanied with snowy weather. As the wind began to\r\nabate, a ship appeared in sight, under all sails, and presently\r\ncame up with the Henrietta. The master hailed, and inquired what had\r\nhappened that my father’s ship was under close-reefed top-sail in\r\nsuch moderate weather. On being told that a storm had just subsided,\r\nhe declared that he knew nothing of it; he observed, indeed, a swell,\r\nand noticed a black cloud a-head of his ship that seemed to advance\r\nbefore him until he was overshadowed with it a little while before he\r\novertook the Henrietta, but he had had fine weather and light winds\r\nthe whole day!\r\n\r\nA single instance is given of those sudden gusts and various currents\r\nof wind, which occur at some elevation in the atmosphere, and which\r\nare common to all climates. On a particularly fine day, my father\r\nhaving landed on the northern part of Charles’s island, incited by\r\nthe same curiosity which led him on shore, ascended, though not\r\nwithout great difficulty and fatigue, a considerable elevation,\r\nthe summit of which was not broader than a common table, and which\r\nshelved on one side as steep as the roof of a house, and on the other\r\nformed a mural precipice. Engaged in admiring the extensive prospect\r\nfrom an eminence of about two thousand feet, he scarcely noticed\r\nthe advance of a very small cloud. Its rapid approach and peculiar\r\nform (having somewhat the appearance of a hand) at length excited\r\nhis attention, and when it reached the place where he was seated\r\nin a calm air, a torrent of wind assailed him with such violence,\r\nthat he was obliged to throw himself on his body and stick his hands\r\nand feet in the snow to prevent himself from being hurled over the\r\ntremendous slope which threatened his instant destruction. The cloud\r\nhaving passed, the air, to his great satisfaction, became calm, when\r\nhe immediately descended by sliding down the surface of snow, and in\r\na few minutes reached the base of the mountain in safety.\r\n\r\nThe course of the seasons, as relates to prevailing winds, is\r\nas follows. In the spring months, north-east and east winds are\r\nfrequent, with severe storms from these and other quarters. The\r\nstorms from the north-east, east, and south-east, are generally the\r\nmost violent. When they occur in March and April, they frequently\r\ncontinue without intermission for two or three successive days, and\r\nrarely subside till the wind veers round to the north or north-west.\r\nStorms, in the spring of the year, blowing from the south-east,\r\ngenerally change, before they abate, to the east, north-east, north,\r\nand north-west; but storms commencing at south-west or south, usually\r\nveer, before they subside, in the contrary direction, towards the\r\nnorth-west, and sometimes continue changing until their strength is\r\nspent in the north or north-east quarter. A storm beginning to blow\r\nfrom the western quarter seldom continues long; when it blows hard\r\nit commonly veers to the north or north-east, and it is observable\r\nthat a very hard southerly or easterly gale is frequently succeeded\r\nwithin a few days by another from the opposite quarter. With the\r\nadvance of the month of May, storms become less frequent, and the\r\nweather becomes sensibly better. The winds then begin to blow more\r\nfrequently from the north-west; in June, the most common winds are\r\nnorth and north-west, south and south-west; and in July, south and\r\nsouth-westerly winds prevail. At this season, calms or very light\r\nwinds also become frequent, and continue sometimes for several days\r\ntogether. In high northern latitudes, however, very heavy storms\r\nfrom the southward occur in July, and blow for thirty or forty hours\r\nat a time. In August, north-east winds begin again to prevail. The\r\nsouth-west and southerly storms of the autumn blow with particular\r\nviolence. “The wind rages so vehemently, that the houses quiver\r\nand crack, the tents and lighter boats fly up in the air, and\r\nthe sea-water scatters about in the land like snow-dust—nay, the\r\nGreenlanders say that the storm rends off stones a couple of pounds’\r\nweight, and mounts them in the air. In summer, whirlwinds also spring\r\nup, that draw up the waters out of the sea, and turn a boat round\r\nseveral times.”\r\n\r\nWhen the countries of temperate climates suffer under tempests in\r\nfrequent succession, Polar regions enjoy comparative tranquillity.\r\nAfter the autumn gales have passed, a series of calm weather,\r\nattended by severe frosts, frequently succeeds. So striking, indeed,\r\nis the stillness of the northern winter, that there is truth in Dr.\r\nGuthrie’s observation, that nature seems “to have studied perfect\r\nequality in the distribution of her favours, as it is only parts of\r\nthe earth which most enjoy the kindly influences of the sun that\r\nsuffer by the effects of its superior heat, so that if the atmosphere\r\nof the north is not so genial as that of the south, at least it\r\nremains perfectly quiet and serene, without threatening destruction\r\nto man and the product of his industry as in what are called happier\r\nclimates.”\r\n\r\nThe principal meteors, not being of the aqueous kind, that remain to\r\nbe considered are lightning and the aurora borealis. As we approach\r\nthe Pole, the former phenomenon becomes more rare, and the latter\r\nmore common. Lightning, indeed, is seldom seen to the northward\r\nof the arctic circle, and when it does occur, it is very seldom\r\naccompanied by thunder.\r\n\r\nIn Spitzbergen, neither thunder nor lightning has, I believe, ever\r\nbeen observed. For my own part, I have never seen lightning northward\r\nof latitude 65°, and only in two instances when at any considerable\r\ndistance from land. The aurora borealis occurs independent of land\r\nand of cold, becoming more frequent in its appearance as we approach\r\nthe Pole, and enlivening by its brilliancy and peculiar grandeur\r\nthe tedious gloom of the long winter nights. Its appearance, though\r\nnot very frequently seen in Britain, is very common as far south as\r\nShetland and Feroe. In Iceland, and other countries bordering on the\r\narctic circle, the northern lights occur almost every clear night\r\nduring the winter. In the summer, they can seldom be seen on account\r\nof the presence of the sun, and in the spring of the year, the\r\nobscurity of the atmosphere prevents their frequent exhibition. In\r\nseveral instances, I have known stormy weather follow the appearance\r\nof the brilliant aurora, and one of the most tremendous storms I was\r\never exposed to, succeeded a splendid exhibition of the northern\r\nlights. Under certain circumstances, especially when they are seen\r\nat a considerable altitude above the horizon, having a red or copper\r\ncolour, they are supposed to be indicative of a violent storm.\r\n\r\nOur chapter on atmospherical phenomena must now be concluded by\r\nobservations on aqueous meteors; including clouds, rain, hail, snow,\r\nfrost-rime, hoar-frost, and fog.\r\n\r\nVery little clear weather occurs in the Greenland seas, for often\r\nwhen the atmosphere is free from any visible vapour on the land, at\r\nsea it is obscured by frost-rime in the spring of the year, and by\r\nclouds or fog in the summer; so that scarcely one-twentieth of the\r\nseason devoted to the whale-fishery can be said to consist of clear\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nThe _clouds_ most generally consist of a dense stratum of obscurity,\r\ncomposed of irregular compact patches covering the whole expanse of\r\nthe heavens. The _cirrus_, _cirrocumulus_, and _cirrostratus_, of\r\nHoward’s nomenclature, are occasionally distinct; the _nimbus_ is\r\npartly formed, but never complete: and the grandeur of the _cumulus_\r\nor thunder-cloud is never seen, unless it be on the land. In the\r\natmosphere over the coasts in Greenland and Spitzbergen, where the\r\nair is greatly warmed by the concentration and reflection of the\r\nsun’s rays in the sheltered valleys, a small imperfect cumulus is\r\nsometimes exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe known agents made use of in the economy of nature for the\r\nproduction of rain are changes of temperature and electricity. The\r\nlatter principle is supposed to act most powerfully in the production\r\nof thunder-showers, in which case it is not unlikely that a portion\r\nof the air of the atmosphere is, by the passing of the lightning from\r\none cloud to another, converted into water. The former seems to be\r\nthe chief agent in the colder regions of the globe, where electricity\r\nis either more equal in its distribution, or not so active in its\r\noperations as in the warmer climates. From the beautiful theory\r\nof the late Dr. James Hutton, supported by the researches of\r\nprofessor Leslie, it appears, that “while the temperature advances\r\nuniformly in arithmetical progression, the dissolving power which\r\nthis communicates to the air mounts with the accelerating rapidity\r\nof a geometrical series;” and this in such a ratio, that the “air\r\nhas its dryness doubled at each rise of temperature answering to\r\nfifteen centesimal degrees,” or twenty-seven of Fahrenheit. Hence,\r\n“whatever be the actual condition of a mass of air, there must\r\nalways exist some temperature at which it would become perfectly\r\ndamp;” and hence whenever two streams of air saturated with moisture\r\nof different temperatures are mixed together, or brush against one\r\nanother, in the form of different currents of wind, there must always\r\nbe a quantity of moisture precipitated. For if two masses of air, of\r\ndifferent temperatures, but equal in quantity, and both saturated\r\nwith moisture, were mixed together, the resulting temperature would\r\nbe nearly the mean of the two, but, at that temperature, the capacity\r\nof air for moisture being less than the quantity contained in the two\r\ncommixed masses, the surplus must be deposited.\r\n\r\nRain is by no means common in the Polar countries excepting in the\r\nmonths of July and August, and then only with southerly or westerly\r\nwinds. During all seasons of the year, however, with strong gales\r\nblowing from a southern climate, rain is occasionally observed in\r\nsituations near the edge of the ice; but snow or sleet are more\r\ncommon even under such circumstances; and in remote situations among\r\nice, near the 80th parallel of latitude, rain seldom or never occurs.\r\n\r\n_Hail_ is a much more familiar meteor in temperate than in frigid\r\nclimates. In the Greenland Sea, this aqueous concretion is very\r\nrarely seen; and if we define it as consisting of pellucid spheres of\r\nice, generated in the atmosphere, it may be said to be unknown in\r\nvery high latitudes. This fact is in favour of the electrical origin\r\nof hail, as it is well-known to be common in temperate climates,\r\nwhere the air is in a high state of electricity, and to be the\r\nfrequent concomitant of thunder and lightning. The only substance\r\nresembling hail that is generated in the frigid zone consists of a\r\nwhite, porous, spherical concretion of light and snowy texture.\r\n\r\n_Snow_ is so very common in the arctic regions, that it may be boldly\r\nstated, that in nine days out of ten, in April, May, and June,\r\nmore or less snow falls. With southerly winds, near the borders of\r\nthe ice, or in situations where humid air, blowing from the sea,\r\nassimilates with a gelid breeze from the ice, the heaviest falls of\r\nsnow occur. In this case, a depth of two or three inches is sometimes\r\ndeposited in an hour. The thickest precipitations also frequently\r\nprecede sudden storms. The form of the particles of snow presents an\r\nendless variety. When the temperature of the air is within a degree\r\nor two of the freezing point, much snow falls, frequently consisting\r\nof large irregular flakes, such as are common in Britain. Sometimes\r\nit exhibits small granular, or large rough white concretions; at\r\nothers, it consists of white spiculæ, or rude stellated crystals. But\r\nin severe frosts, though the sky appears perfectly clear, lamellar\r\nflakes of snow, of the most regular and beautiful forms, are always\r\nseen floating in the air, and sparkling in the sunbeams, and the snow\r\nwhich falls in general is of most elegant texture and appearance.\r\n\r\nSnow, of a reddish or brownish colour, is not unfrequently seen.\r\nThe brownish stain, which occurs on shore, is given by an earthy\r\nsubstance brought from the mountains by the streams of water, derived\r\nfrom thawing ice and snow, or the fall of rain. The reddish colour,\r\nas far as I have observed, is given by the mute of birds; though,\r\nin the example met with by captain Ross, in Baffin’s Bay, the stain\r\nappears to have been of a vegetable nature. The little auk, (_Alca\r\nalle_,) which feeds upon shrimps, is found, in some parts of the\r\nPolar seas, in immense numbers. They frequently retreat to pieces\r\nof ice, or surfaces of snow, and stain them all over red with their\r\nmute. Martens saw red snow in Spitzbergen, which he considered as\r\nbeing stained by rain-water running down by the rocks.\r\n\r\nThe extreme beauty and endless variety of the microscopic objects\r\nprocured in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, are perhaps fully\r\nequalled, if not surpassed, in both particulars of beauty and\r\nvariety, by the crystals of snow. The principal configurations are\r\nthe stelliform and hexagonal, though almost every shape, of which\r\nthe generating angles of 60° and 12° are susceptible, may, in the\r\ncourse of a few years’ observation, be discovered. The various\r\nmodifications of crystals may be classed under five general kinds,\r\nor genera.\r\n\r\n1. _Lamellar_, infinite in variety, most delicate in structure, and\r\ncapable of sub-division into several distinct species.\r\n\r\n2. _A lamellar, or spherical nucleus, with spinous ramifications in\r\ndifferent planes._ This genus also consists of two or three species.\r\n\r\n3. _Fine spiculæ, or six-sided prisms._ The finest specimens resemble\r\nwhite hair, cut into lengths not exceeding a quarter of an inch.\r\n\r\n4. _Hexagonal pyramids._ I have but once seen this kind of snow\r\ncrystal.\r\n\r\n5. _Spiculæ, or prisms having one or both extremities inserted in the\r\ncentre of a lamellar crystal._ This genus resembles a pair of wheels,\r\nunited by an axle-tree.\r\n\r\nIn low temperatures, the greatest proportion of crystals that fall\r\nare, probably, perfect geometrical figures.\r\n\r\nSome of the general varieties in the figures of the crystals may\r\nbe referred to the temperature of the air; but the particular and\r\nendless modifications of similar classes of crystals can only be\r\nreferred to the pleasure of the great First Cause, whose works, even\r\nthe most minute and evanescent, and in regions the most remote from\r\nhuman observation, bear the impress of His own hand, and display to\r\nhis intelligent creatures his vast and beneficent wisdom. If, on\r\nthese forms of unintelligent matter, he has bestowed such excellent\r\nworkmanship, with how much more transcendent loveliness will he\r\nclothe those who are redeemed by the exceeding riches of his grace,\r\nand who, beyond the history and productions of all worlds, will\r\nreflect the beauty of his glorious countenance!\r\n\r\n_Frost-rime_, or frost-smoke, is a meteor peculiar to those parts of\r\nthe globe where a very low temperature prevails for a considerable\r\ntime. It consists of a dense frozen vapour, apparently arising out of\r\nthe sea, or any large sheet of water, and ascending, in high winds\r\nand turbulent seas, to the height of eighty or one hundred feet,\r\nbut, in light breezes and smooth water, creeping along the surface.\r\nThe particles of which it consists are as small as dust, and cleave\r\nto the rigging of ships, or almost any substance against which they\r\nare driven by the wind, and afford a coating of an inch or upwards\r\nin depth. These particles adhere to one another until the windward\r\nsurface of the ropes is covered, and form long fibres somewhat of a\r\nprismatical or pyramidal shape, having their points directed towards\r\nthe wind. Frost-rime adheres readily to articles of clothing; and,\r\nfrom the circumstance of its lodging in the hair, and giving it the\r\nappearance of being powdered, the sailors humorously style it “the\r\nbarber.” Such of the frost-rime as is dislodged from the rigging\r\nwhenever the ship is tacked, covers the deck to a considerable\r\nthickness, and, when trod upon, emits an acute sound, resembling the\r\ncrushing of fine particles of glass. The cause of this phenomenon,\r\nwhich generally is not observed until the cold is reduced to 14°,\r\nmay perhaps be similar to that producing rain, and may be explained\r\naccording to Dr. Hutton’s theory.\r\n\r\nAn aqueous vapour, consisting of very minute frozen particles,\r\nsometimes occupies the lower regions of the atmosphere in temperate\r\nand frigid climates, during frosty weather, and is deposited on\r\nthe ground, on surfaces of ice, or almost any other substance with\r\nwhich it comes in contact. This vapour seems to be of the nature of\r\n_hoar-frost_; it generally appears in the evening, after a bright\r\nsunshiny day.\r\n\r\n_Fog_, or mist, is the last meteor that remains to be considered.\r\nThis is one of the greatest annoyances that the arctic whalers have\r\nto encounter. It frequently prevails during the greater part of the\r\nmonth of July, and sometimes, at considerable intervals, in June\r\nand August. Its density is often such, that it circumscribes the\r\nprospect to an area of a few acres, not being pervious to sight at\r\nthe distance of a hundred yards. It frequently lies so low that the\r\nbrightness of the sun is scarcely at all intercepted; in such cases,\r\nsubstances warmed by the sun’s rays, give to the air immediately\r\nabove them increased capacity for moisture, by which evaporation goes\r\nbriskly on during the densest fogs. In Newfoundland, on occasions\r\nwhen the sun’s rays penetrate the mist, and heat the surface of the\r\nrocks, fish is frequently dried during the thickest fogs. Fogs are\r\nmore frequent and more dense at the borders of the ice than near the\r\ncoast of Spitzbergen. They occur principally when the mercury, in the\r\nthermometer, is near the freezing point, but they are by no means\r\nuncommon with the temperature of 40° or 45°. They are most general\r\nwith south-westerly, southerly, and south-easterly winds. They seldom\r\noccur with high winds, yet in one or two instances I have observed\r\nthem very thick, even in storms. Rain generally disperses them. Fogs,\r\nby increasing the apparent distances of objects, appear sometimes to\r\nmagnify men into giants, hummocks of ice into mountains, and common\r\npieces of drift-ice into heavy floes or bergs. They are an especial\r\nannoyance to the whale-fisher, and greatly perplex the navigator,\r\nby preventing him from obtaining observations for the correction\r\nof his latitude and longitude, so that he often sails in complete\r\nuncertainty. Fogs are more common near the ice than in the vicinity\r\nof the land, more frequent in open seasons than in close seasons, and\r\nmore intense and more common in the southern fishing-stations than in\r\nthe most northern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA SKETCH OF THE ZOOLOGY OF THE ARCTIC REGIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the arrangement of the following original observations on,\r\nand descriptions of the more remarkable animals inhabiting, or\r\nfrequenting, Spitzbergen and the adjacent seas, I have followed\r\nLinnæus, in combination with La Cepède. The latter author has\r\npublished a most voluminous and pleasing account of cetaceous\r\nanimals, and has made some judicious changes in the Linnæan\r\narrangements. By La Cepède, for instance, whales having the dorsal\r\nfin are separated from those without it; the former being called, in\r\ndistinction from the latter, _Balænopteræ_, signifying whales with a\r\nfin.\r\n\r\nOur first description must relate to the animals of the _cetaceous\r\nkind_, which frequent the Greenland Seas.\r\n\r\nOf these the first in eminence and of importance to our commerce,\r\nis the _Balæna mysticetus_, the common or Greenland whale. This\r\nanimal is productive of more oil than any other of the cetacea, and\r\nbeing less active, slower in its motion, and more timid than any\r\nother of its kind, of similar, or nearly similar, magnitude, it is\r\nmore easily captured. Its size has been much overrated, and, in his\r\nexcellent natural history of cetaceous animals, La Cepède has been\r\nguilty of considerable exaggeration. In the age when whales were\r\nregarded with superstitious dread, it is easy to conceive that the\r\ndimensions of an animal inhabiting an element in which it cannot\r\neasily be measured, would be recorded with extravagance. Authors of\r\nthe first respectability in the present day give a length of eighty\r\nto one hundred feet to the mysticetus, and remark with unqualified\r\nassertion, that when the captures were less frequent, and the animals\r\nhad sufficient time to attain their full growth, specimens were\r\nfound of one hundred and fifty to two hundred feet in length, or\r\neven longer; and some ancient naturalists, indeed, have gone so far\r\nas to assert, that whales had been seen of above nine hundred feet\r\nin length. In the present day, however, it is certain that they are\r\nby no means so bulky. Of three hundred and twenty-two individuals,\r\nin the capture of which I have been personally concerned, no one,\r\nI believe, exceeded sixty feet in length, and the largest I ever\r\nmeasured was fifty-eight feet, from one extremity to the other,\r\nbeing one of the largest to appearance which I ever saw. An uncommon\r\nwhale that was caught near Spitzbergen, about twenty years ago,\r\nthe whalebone of which measured almost fifteen feet, was not, I\r\nunderstand, so much as seventy feet in length; and the longest\r\nactual measurement that I have met with, or heard of, is given by\r\nsir Charles Giesecké, who informs us, that in the spring of 1813,\r\na whale was killed at Godhaven of the length of sixty-seven feet.\r\nThese, however, are very uncommon instances. I therefore conceive\r\nthat sixty feet may be considered as the size of the larger animals\r\nof this species, and sixty-five feet in length as a magnitude which\r\nvery rarely occurs.\r\n\r\nI believe, too, that whales are now met with of as large dimensions\r\nas at any former period since the commencement of the whale-fishery;\r\na point which, I think, can be established from various historical\r\nrecords.\r\n\r\nThe greatest circumference of the whale is from thirty to forty feet.\r\nIt is thickest a little behind the fins, or in the middle, between\r\nthe anterior and posterior extremes of the animal, from whence it\r\ngradually tapers in a conical form towards the tail, and slightly\r\ntowards the head. Its form is cylindrical, from the neck to within\r\nten feet of the tail, beyond which it becomes somewhat quadrangular,\r\nthe greatest ridge being upward, or on the back, and running backward\r\nnearly across the middle of the tail. The head has somewhat of a\r\ntriangular shape. The under-part, the arched outline of which is\r\ngiven by the jaw-bones, is flat, and measures sixteen to twenty feet\r\nin length, and ten to twelve in breadth. The lips, extending fifteen\r\nor twenty feet in length, and five or six in height, and forming\r\nthe cavity of the mouth, are attached to the under-jaw, and rise\r\nfrom the jaw-bones at an angle of about 80°, having the appearance,\r\nwhen viewed in front, of the letter U. The upper-jaw, including the\r\n“crown-bone,” or skull, is bent down at the extremity, so as to\r\nshut the front and upper parts of the cavity of the mouth, and is\r\noverlapped by the lips in a squamous manner at the sides.\r\n\r\nWhen the mouth is open, it presents a cavity as large as a room, and\r\ncapable of containing a merchant-ship’s jolly-boat full of men, being\r\nsix or eight feet wide, ten or twelve feet high in front, and fifteen\r\nor sixteen feet long. The fins, two in number, are placed between\r\none-third and two-fifths of the length of the animal, from the snout,\r\nand about two feet behind the angle of the mouth. They are seven to\r\nnine feet in length, and four or five in breadth; and in the living\r\nanimal are capable of considerable flexion. The whale has no dorsal\r\nfin.\r\n\r\nThe tail, comprising in a single surface eighty or one hundred square\r\nfeet, is a formidable instrument of motion or defence. Its length\r\nis only five or six feet, but its width is eighteen to twenty-four\r\nor twenty-six feet. Its position is horizontal. In its form it is\r\nflat and semi-lunar, indented in the middle, the two lobes somewhat\r\npointed and turned a little backward. Its motions are rapid and\r\nuniversal; its strength immense.\r\n\r\nThe eyes are situated in the sides of the head, about a foot\r\nobliquely above and behind the angle of the mouth. They are little\r\nlarger than those of an ox. The whale has no external ear. The\r\nspiracles or nostrils of the whale are two longitudinal apertures,\r\nsix or eight inches in length, from which a moist vapour, mixed\r\nwith mucous, is discharged when the animal breathes, but no water\r\naccompanies it unless the breathing takes place under the surface.\r\nThe mouth, in place of teeth, contains two extensive rows of “fins,”\r\nor whalebone, which are suspended from the sides of the crown-bone.\r\nEach series, or side of bone, as the whale-fishers term it, consists\r\nof upwards of three hundred laminæ, of which the longest are near the\r\nmiddle. Ten or eleven feet is the average length, and the greatest\r\nbreadth at the gum ten or twelve inches. The interior edges of these\r\nlaminæ are covered with a fringe of hair. In the youngest whales,\r\ncalled suckers, the whalebone is only a few inches long; when the\r\nlength reaches six feet or upwards, the whale is said to be of\r\n_size_. The colour of the whalebone is brownish black, or bluish\r\nblack, and occasionally striped longitudinally with white. A large\r\nwhale sometimes affords a ton and a half of whalebone. The gum,\r\nin which the thick ends of the whalebone are inserted, is white,\r\nfibrous, tender, and tasteless. It cuts like cheese, and has the\r\nappearance of the kernel of the cocoanut. The animal has a large\r\ntongue, a slight beard, and a remarkably narrow throat.\r\n\r\nThe milk of the whale resembles that of quadrupeds in appearance, and\r\nis said to be rich and well-flavoured. In the female, two paps are\r\nsituated on the abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the mysticetus is velvet black, grey, and white, with\r\na tinge of yellow, according to the parts of the body. The older\r\nanimals contain the most grey and white; under-sized whales are\r\naltogether of a bluish black, and suckers of a pale bluish, or bluish\r\ngrey colour.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the body is slightly furrowed, but on the tail it is\r\nsmooth. That part of the skin, which can be pulled off in sheets\r\nafter it has been dried a little in the air, or particularly in the\r\nfrost, is not thicker than parchment. The _rete mucosum_ in adults is\r\nabout three-fourths of an inch in thickness over most parts of the\r\nbody. Under it lies the true skin, white and tough, and immediately\r\nin contact with it the blubber.\r\n\r\nThis most valuable portion of the animal encompasses its whole\r\nbody. Its colour is yellowish white, yellow, or red; in old animals\r\nsometimes resembling the substance of the salmon. It swims in water.\r\nIts thickness all round the body is eight or ten to twenty inches,\r\nvarying in different parts, as well as in different individuals. The\r\nlips are composed almost entirely of blubber, and yield from one to\r\ntwo tons of pure oil each. The oil appears retained in the blubber\r\nin minute cells, connected by a strong reticulated combination of\r\ntendinous fibres, which are condensed at the surface, and appears\r\nto form the substance of the skin. The oil is expelled when heated.\r\nIn its fresh state, the blubber is without unpleasant smell, and it\r\nis only at the end of the voyage that the cargo of a Greenland ship\r\nbecomes disagreeable.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of oil yielded by a certain quantity of blubber varies\r\naccording to the age of the animal; the blubber of the sucker\r\ncontains a very small portion. The quantity of oil generally bears a\r\nproportion to the length of the longest blade of whalebone. Four tons\r\nof blubber in measure generally produce three tons of oil; the ton of\r\noil being two hundred and fifty-two gallons, wine-measure.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the young whale is of a red colour, and, when broiled\r\nand seasoned with pepper and salt, eats like coarse beef. The bones\r\nare very porous, and contain much fine oil. The ribs are thirteen in\r\nnumber, and are nearly solid, and the bones of the fins, in number\r\nand proportion, are similar to those of the fingers of the human hand.\r\n\r\nA stout whale, of sixty feet in length, is of the enormous weight of\r\nseventy tons; the blubber weighs about thirty tons; the bones of the\r\nhead, whalebone, fins, and tail, eight or ten; the carcase thirty or\r\nthirty-two.\r\n\r\nThe whale is dull of hearing, but its sense of seeing is acute,\r\nespecially when under water. It has no voice, but makes in breathing\r\nor blowing a very loud noise. It blows or breathes about four or\r\nfive times a minute, discharging vapour to the height of some yards,\r\nwhich, at a distance, looks like a puff of smoke. When the animal is\r\nwounded, this vapour is often stained with blood, and on the approach\r\nof death jets of blood are sometimes discharged. The whale being\r\nlighter than the water, can remain at the surface with ease, but\r\nrequires considerable exertion to descend. It advances through the\r\nwater by means of the tail, which, to attain the greatest velocity,\r\nis moved alternately upward and downward; and, for slower progress,\r\nlaterally and obliquely downward, in the manner of _skulling_ a boat.\r\nThe fins are used for balancing the animal, and in bearing off their\r\nyoung. I have observed a whale descending, after I had harpooned\r\nit, to the depth of four hundred fathoms, with the average velocity\r\nof seven or eight miles per hour. The usual rate at which whales\r\nswim, however, seldom exceeds four miles an hour, and though their\r\nextreme velocity may be eight or nine, yet we find this speed never\r\ncontinues longer than for a few minutes. They sometimes ascend with\r\nsuch rapidity as to leap entirely out of the water, apparently for\r\namusement, and to the high admiration of the distant spectator. At\r\nother times they throw themselves into a perpendicular posture, with\r\ntheir heads downward, and rearing their tails on high in the air,\r\nthey beat the water with awful violence; the sea is thrown into foam,\r\nthe air is filled with vapours, and the noise in calm weather is\r\nheard to a great distance. Sometimes the whale shakes its tremendous\r\ntail in the air, which, cracking like a whip, resounds to the\r\ndistance of two or three miles.\r\n\r\nWhen it retires from the surface, it first lifts its head, then\r\nplunging it under water, elevates its back, like the segment of a\r\nsphere, deliberately rounds it away towards the extremity, throws its\r\ntail out of the water, and then disappears. Whales usually remain\r\nat the surface to breathe about two minutes, during which time they\r\n“blow” eight or nine times, and then descend for an interval usually\r\nof five or ten minutes, but sometimes, when feeding, fifteen or\r\ntwenty. They commonly descend to only a trifling depth; but, when\r\nstruck, they have been known, by the quantity of line taken out of\r\nthe boat, to descend to the depth of an English mile, and, with such\r\nvelocity, as to break their jaw-bones by the blow struck against the\r\nbottom. Occasionally, they may be found sleeping in calm weather\r\namong ice, and some persons are of opinion that, when undisturbed,\r\nthey can remain under the surface for many hours at a time.\r\n\r\nThe food of the whale consists of various species of _actiniæ_,\r\n_clioncs_, _sepiæ_, _medusæ_, _cancri_, and _helices_, judging from\r\nthe fact that some of these genera are always to be seen wherever any\r\ntribe of whales is found stationary. I have only discovered in the\r\nstomachs of dead animals _squillæ_ or shrimps. When the whale feeds,\r\nit swims swiftly through the sea, with its jaws extended; its food is\r\nentangled by the whalebone, which, from its compact arrangement and\r\nthick internal covering of hair, does not allow a particle to escape.\r\n\r\nThe whale has one young at a birth. At this time the young one\r\nis said to be at least ten feet long, and continues under the\r\nprotection of the mother for probably a year, until, by the growth\r\nof the whalebone, it is able to maintain itself. It probably reaches\r\nthe magnitude called _size_, that is, with a six feet length of\r\nwhalebone, in twelve years, and attains its full growth at the age\r\nof twenty or twenty-five. Whales live to a great age. The maternal\r\naffection of the whale is very interesting. The cub, being insensible\r\nto danger, is easily harpooned, and is sometimes struck as a snare\r\nto secure the mother. In this case she joins it at the surface\r\nwhenever it has occasion to rise for respiration, encourages it to\r\nswim off, assists its flight by taking it under her fin, and seldom\r\ndeserts it while life remains. In June, 1811, one of my harpooners\r\nstruck a sucker, with the hope of its leading to the capture of the\r\nmother. Presently she arose close by “the fast-boat,” and seizing the\r\nyoung one, dragged about a hundred fathoms of line out of the boat\r\nwith remarkable force and velocity. Again she rose to the surface,\r\ndarted furiously to and fro, frequently stopped short, or suddenly\r\nchanged her direction, and gave every possible intimation of extreme\r\nagony. For a length of time she continued thus to act, though closely\r\npursued by the boats; and, inspired with courage and resolution by\r\nher concern for her offspring, seemed regardless of the danger which\r\nsurrounded her. At length, one of the boats approached so near that a\r\nharpoon was hove at her. It hit, but did not attach itself. A second\r\nharpoon was struck, this also failed to penetrate, but a third was\r\nmore effectual, and held. Still she did not attempt to escape, but\r\nallowed other boats to approach, so that, in a few minutes, three\r\nmore harpoons were fastened, and, in the course of an hour afterwards\r\nshe was killed.\r\n\r\nThere is something deeply interesting in the manner in which the\r\ngreat Maker of all things, in giving laws to the animal kingdom, has\r\nthus presented so many illustrations of the parental relation. It\r\nis as if he would not leave his intelligent creatures destitute of\r\nmemorials of their relation to himself; so that, while in the field\r\nand on the flood, they behold the signs of parental affection and\r\nfilial dependence, they may be led to ponder the solemn question of\r\ntheir tender and faithful Parent in heaven—“If, then, I be a Father,\r\nwhere is mine honour?”\r\n\r\nThe mysticetus occurs most abundantly in the frozen seas of Greenland\r\nand Davis’s Strait, in the bays of Baffin and Hudson, in the sea\r\nto the northward of Behring’s Strait, and along some part of the\r\nnorthern shores of Asia, and probably America. It is never met with\r\nin the German Ocean, and rarely within two hundred leagues of the\r\nBritish coast; but along the coasts of Africa and South America it\r\nis met with periodically, in considerable numbers. In these regions,\r\nit is attacked and captured by the southern British and American\r\nwhalers, as well as by some of the people inhabiting the coasts to\r\nwhich it resorts. Whether this whale is precisely of the same kind\r\nas that of Spitzbergen and Greenland is uncertain, though it is\r\nevidently a mysticetus. One striking difference, possibly the effect\r\nof situation and climate, is, that the mysticetus in southern regions\r\nis often covered with barnacles, while those of the Arctic Seas are\r\nfree from these shell-fish.\r\n\r\nBesides the formidable inroads made upon the whale by man, it is\r\nsubject to annoyance from sharks, and it is also said from the\r\nnarwal, sword-fish, and thrasher. The opinion as to the narwal I\r\nam persuaded is incorrect; the sword-fish and thrasher (if such\r\nan animal there be) may be enemies of the whale, and the shark\r\ncertainly is hostile to the extent of his ability, which, in\r\ncomparison to that of the whale, can hardly be very formidable.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the flesh of the whale is now eaten by savage\r\nnations, and it is also well authenticated that, in the twelfth,\r\nthirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, it was used as food\r\nby the Icelanders, the Netherlander, the French, the Spaniards, and,\r\nprobably, by the English. Besides forming a choice eatable, the\r\ninferior products of the whale are applied to other purposes by the\r\nIndians and Esquimaux of Arctic countries, and, with some nations,\r\nare essential to their comfort. Some membranes of the abdomen\r\nare used for an upper article of clothing, and the peritoneum in\r\nparticular, being thin and transparent, is used instead of glass in\r\nthe windows of their huts; the bones are converted into harpoons\r\nand spears for striking the seal, or darting at the sea-birds, and\r\nare also employed in the erection of their tents, and, with some\r\ntribes, in the formation of their boats; the sinews are divided into\r\nfilaments, and used as thread, with which they join the seams of\r\ntheir boats and tent-cloths, and sew, with great taste and nicety,\r\nthe different articles of dress they manufacture; and the whalebone\r\nand other superior products, so valuable in European markets, have\r\nalso their uses among them.\r\n\r\nThe largest animal of the whale tribe is not the mysticetus, but the\r\n_Balæna physalis_ of Linnæus, _Balænoptera gibbar_ of La Cepède, and\r\nrazor-back of the whalers. This is, probably, the most powerful and\r\nbulky of created beings. In comparison with the mysticetus, it has\r\na form less cylindrical, a body longer and more slender, whalebone\r\nshorter, produce in blubber and oil less, colour bluer, fins more\r\nnumerous, breathing more violent, speed greater, and actions quicker,\r\nmore restless and more bold. Its length is about one hundred feet,\r\nand its greatest circumference thirty or thirty-five. Its colour is\r\na pale bluish black, or dark bluish grey, in which it resembles the\r\nsucking mysticetus. Besides the two pectoral fins, it has a small\r\nhorny protuberance, or rayless and immovable fin on the extremity\r\nof the back. Its greatest velocity in swimming is about twelve\r\nmiles an hour. It is by no means a timid animal, yet it does not\r\nappear revengeful or mischievous. When closely pursued by boats, it\r\nmanifests little fear, and does not attempt to outstrip them in the\r\nrace, but merely endeavours to avoid them by diving or changing its\r\ndirection. If harpooned, or wounded, it then exerts all its energies,\r\nand escapes with its utmost velocity, but shows little disposition\r\nto retaliate on its enemies, or to repel their attacks by engaging\r\nin a combat. Unlike the mysticetus, it very rarely, when descending\r\ninto the water, throws its tail into the air. Its great speed and\r\nactivity render it a difficult and dangerous object of attack, and\r\nthe small quantity of inferior oil it affords makes it unworthy the\r\ngeneral attention of the fishers. When struck, it not uncommonly\r\ndrags the fast-boat with such speed through the water, that it is\r\nliable to be carried immediately beyond the reach of assistance, and\r\nsoon out of sight of both boats and ship. Hence the striker is under\r\nthe necessity of cutting the line, and sacrificing his employer’s\r\nproperty for securing the safety of himself and his companions. In\r\nthe year 1818, I ordered a general chase of them, providing against\r\nthe danger of having my crew separated from the ship by appointing a\r\nrendezvous on the shore not far distant, and preparing against the\r\nloss of much line by dividing it at two hundred fathoms from the\r\nharpoon, and affixing a buoy to the end of it. Thus arranged, one\r\nof these whales was shot, and another struck. The former dived with\r\nsuch impetuosity that the line was broken by the resistance of the\r\nbuoy, as soon as it was thrown into the water, and the latter was\r\nliberated within a minute by the division of the line, occasioned,\r\nit was supposed, by its friction against the dorsal fin. Both of\r\nthem escaped. Another physalis was struck by one of my inexperienced\r\nharpooners, who mistook it for a mysticetus. It dived obliquely with\r\nsuch velocity that four hundred and eighty fathoms of line were\r\nwithdrawn from the boat in about a minute of time. This whale was\r\nalso lost by the breaking of the line.\r\n\r\nThe physalis occurs in great numbers in the Arctic Seas, especially\r\nalong the edge of the ice, between Cherie Island and Nova Zembla,\r\nand also near Jan Mayen. Persons trading to Archangel have often\r\nmistaken it for the common whale. It is seldom seen among much ice,\r\nand seems to be avoided by the mysticetus; hence the fishers view it\r\nwith painful concern. It inhabits most generally in the Spitzbergen\r\nquarter the parallels of 70° to 76°; but in the months of June, July,\r\nand August, when the sea is usually open, it advances along the land\r\nto the northward as high as 80° of latitude. In open seasons it is\r\nseen near the headland at an earlier period. A whale, probably of\r\nthis kind, one hundred and one feet in length, was stranded on the\r\nbanks of the Humber, about the middle of September, 1750.\r\n\r\nAnother species of whale frequenting the coasts of Scotland, Ireland,\r\nNorway, etc., is the _Balænoptera rorqual_ of La Cepède, _Balæna\r\nmusculus_ of Linnæus, or the broad-nosed whale.\r\n\r\nIn many characters, this species resembles the physalis, though, I\r\nthink, with an essential difference. The musculus is shorter, having\r\na larger head and mouth, and a rounder under-jaw than the physalis\r\nand is said to feed principally upon herrings. Several individuals,\r\napparently of this kind, have been stranded or killed on different\r\nparts of the coast of the United Kingdom. One was embayed and killed\r\nin Balta Sound, Shetland, in the winter of 1817-18, some remains of\r\nwhich I saw. It was eighty-two feet in length, the jaw-bones were\r\ntwenty-one feet long, and the largest lamina of whalebone about three\r\nfeet. Instead of hair at the inner edge, and at the point of each\r\nblade of whalebone, it had a fringe of bristly fibres, and it was\r\nstiffer, harder, and more horny in its texture than common whalebone.\r\nIt produced only about five tons of oil, all of it of an inferior\r\nquality; some of it viscid and bad. It valued, deducting expenses, no\r\nmore than £60 sterling. It had the usual sulci about the thorax, and\r\na dorsal fin.\r\n\r\nA smaller species of whale is _Balænoptera jubartes_ of La Cepède,\r\n_Balæna boops_ of Linnæus, or the finner of the whale-fishers.\r\n\r\nThe following is its description:—Length, about forty-six feet;\r\ngreatest circumference of the body, about twenty feet; dorsal\r\nprotuberance, or fin, about two feet and a half high; pectoral fins,\r\nfour or five feet long externally, and scarcely a foot broad; tail,\r\nabout three feet deep and ten broad; whalebone, about three hundred\r\nlaminæ on each side, the longest about eighteen inches in length,\r\nthe under-jaw about fifteen feet long, or one-third of the whole\r\nlength of the animal; sulci, about two dozen in number; two external\r\nblow-holes; blubber on the body two or three inches thick, under the\r\nsulci none.\r\n\r\nThe last, and smallest of the whalebone whales, with which I am\r\nacquainted, is the _Balænoptera acuto-rostrata_ of La Cepède, _Balæna\r\nrostrata_ of Linnæus, or the beaked whale. An animal of this kind was\r\nkilled in Scalpa Bay, November 14, 1808. Its length was seventeen and\r\na half feet, circumference twenty. Pectoral fins, two feet long and\r\nseven inches broad; dorsal fin fifteen inches long by four and a half\r\nfeet broad. Largest whalebone, about six inches. The rostrata is said\r\nto inhabit principally the Norwegian Seas, and to grow to the length\r\nof twenty-five feet. One of the species was killed near Spitzbergen,\r\nin 1813, and I have some of the whalebone in my possession.\r\n\r\nThree species of narwals are noticed by La Cepède, though I myself\r\nhave seen but one, and perhaps the other species are imaginary, for\r\nthe animal varies in appearance. It is the _Monodon monoceros_ of\r\nLinnæus, and the narwal, or unicorn, of whalers.\r\n\r\nIt is, when full grown, from thirteen to sixteen feet in length,\r\nexclusive of the tusk; and in circumference (two feet behind the\r\nfins, where it is thickest,) eight to nine feet. The form of the\r\nhead, with the part of the body before the fins, is paraboloidal;\r\nof the middle of the body, nearly cylindrical; of the hinder-part,\r\nto within two or three feet of tail, somewhat conical, and from\r\nthence a ridge, commencing both at the back and belly; the section\r\nbecomes first an ellipse, and then a rhombus, at the junction\r\nof the tail. At the distance of twelve or fourteen inches from\r\nthe tail the perpendicular diameter is about twelve inches, the\r\ntransverse diameter about seven. The head is about one-seventh of\r\nthe whole length of the animal; it is small, blunt, round, and of\r\na paraboloidal form. The mouth is small and not capable of much\r\nextension. The under-lip is wedge-shaped. The eyes are small, the\r\nlargest diameter being only an inch, and are placed in a line with\r\nthe opening of the mouth about thirteen inches from the snout. The\r\nblow-hole, which is directly over the eyes, is a single opening, of\r\na semicircular form, about three and a half inches in diameter, or\r\nbreadth, and one and a half radius, or length. The fins are twelve or\r\nfourteen inches long, and six or eight broad; the tail, from fifteen\r\nto twenty inches long, and three to four feet broad. It has no dorsal\r\nfin, but in place of it an irregular, sharpish, fatty ridge. The\r\ncolour of the narwal is in the young animal blackish grey, on the\r\nback variegated with numerous darker spots, running into one another;\r\nin the older animals the ground is wholly white, or yellowish white.\r\nThe integuments are similar to those of the mysticetus, only thinner.\r\n\r\nA long prominent tusk, with which some narwals are furnished, is\r\nconsidered as a horn by the whale-fishers, and as such has given\r\noccasion for the name of _unicorn_ being applied to this animal. This\r\ntusk occurs on the left side of the head, and is sometimes found\r\nof the length of nine or ten feet; according to Egedé, fourteen or\r\nfifteen. It springs from the lower part of the upper-jaw, points\r\nforward and a little downward, being parallel in its direction to the\r\nroof of the mouth. It is spirally situated from right to left, is\r\nnearly straight, and tapers to around, blunt point, is of a yellowish\r\nwhite colour, and consists of a compact kind of ivory. It is usually\r\nhollow from the base to within a few inches of the point. In a five\r\nfeet tusk the diameter at the base is two and a quarter inches, and\r\nabout three-eighths within an inch of the end. This external tusk is\r\npeculiar to the male, and there is another imbedded in the skull,\r\non the right side of the head, about nine inches long. Two or three\r\ninstances have occurred of male narwals having been taken, which\r\nhad two large external tusks. The use of the tusk is ambiguous. It\r\ncannot be essential for procuring their food, nor for defence. Dr.\r\nBarclay is of opinion that it is principally a sexual distinction;\r\nand it appears not improbable that it is used in piercing the ice for\r\nconvenience of breathing, without the animal being obliged to retreat\r\nto open water. If this latter supposition be correct, it affords\r\nanother illustration of the wisdom of the great Creator, who has\r\nadapted in so many instances the organization of every animal to the\r\nlocality which it inhabits.\r\n\r\nA quantity of blubber, from two to three and a half inches in\r\nthickness, and amounting sometimes to above half a ton, encompasses\r\nthe whole body of the narwal, and affords a large proportion of\r\nvery fine oil. In a fine fatty substance about the internal ears of\r\nthe narwal are found multitudes of worms. They are about an inch in\r\nlength, some shorter, very slender, and taper both ways, but are\r\nsharper at one end than at the other. They are transparent. The\r\nvertebral column of the narwal is about twelve feet in length. The\r\ncervical vertebræ are seven in number, the dorsal twelve, the lumbar\r\nand caudal thirty-five. The spinal marrow appears to run through the\r\nprocesses of all the vertebræ from the head to the fortieth, but does\r\nnot penetrate the forty-first. The ribs are twelve on each side, six\r\ntrue and six false, and are small for the size of the animal. The\r\nprincipal food of the narwal are molluscous animals. I have found\r\nremains of sepiæ in several stomachs which I have examined. Narwals\r\nare quick, active, inoffensive animals, and swim with considerable\r\nvelocity. They appear in numerous little herds of half a dozen or\r\nmore together, each herd being most frequently composed of animals\r\nof the same sex. When harpooned, the narwal dives with almost the\r\nvelocity of the mysticetus, but not to the same extent; on returning\r\nto the surface it is dispatched with a lance in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nPassing now from these tribes, a short space must be allotted to the\r\ndescription of the dolphins. The first is _Delphinus deductor_,\r\ndefined by Dr. Traill, the ca’ing or leading whale. The following are\r\nits specific characters. Body thick, black; one short dorsal fin;\r\npectoral fins long, narrow; head obtuse; upper jaw bent forward;\r\nteeth subconoid, sharp, and a little bent.\r\n\r\nThis animal grows to the length of about twenty-four feet, and is\r\nabout ten feet in circumference. The skin is smooth, resembling\r\noiled-silk; the colour a white blueish black on the back, and\r\ngenerally whitish on the belly; the blubber is three or four inches\r\nthick. The head is short and round; the upper jaw projects a little\r\nover the lower. Externally it has a single spiracle. The full grown\r\nhave generally twenty-two to twenty-four teeth in each jaw, and when\r\nthe mouth is shut, the teeth lock between one another like the teeth\r\nof a trap. The tail is about five feet broad, the dorsal fin about\r\nfifteen inches high, cartilaginous, and immovable.\r\n\r\nThis kind of dolphin sometimes appears in large herds off the Orkney,\r\nShetland, and Feroe islands. The main body of the herd follows the\r\nleading whales, and from this property the animal is called in\r\nShetland the ca’ing whale, and by Dr. Traill the deductor. Many herds\r\nof this animal have been driven on shore at different periods, and\r\nit is recorded that there were taken in two places in the year 1664\r\nabout a thousand; and in modern times extensive slaughters have\r\ntaken place on the shores of the British and other northern islands.\r\n\r\nThe _Delphinapterus beluga_ of La Cepède, _Delphinus Leucas_ of\r\nLinnæus, _Beluga_ of Pennant, or white whale of the fishers, is\r\nthe last of the cetacea to which we shall refer. It is not unlike\r\nthe narwal in its general form, but is thicker about the middle of\r\nits body in proportion to its length. Both jaws are furnished with\r\nteeth. It has no dorsal fin. The skin is smooth, the colour white.\r\nA male animal of this kind was taken in the Frith of Forth in June,\r\n1815. The length was thirteen feet four inches, and the greatest\r\ncircumference nine feet. The beluga is generally met with in families\r\nor herds of five or ten together. They are plentiful in Hudson’s\r\nBay, Davis’s Strait, and on some parts of the northern coasts of\r\nEurope and Asia, where they frequent some of the larger rivers.\r\nThey are taken for the sake of the oil they produce by harpoons or\r\nstrong nets; in the latter case, the nets are extended across the\r\nstream, so as to prevent their escape out of the river, and when\r\nthus interrupted in their course to seaward, they are attacked with\r\nlances, and great numbers are sometimes killed.\r\n\r\nIt is now our purpose to give an account of the _quadrupeds_ which\r\ninhabit Spitzbergen and the icy seas adjacent.\r\n\r\nThe connecting link between the mammalia of the land and the\r\nwater is _Trichecus rosmarus_, walrus, morse, or sea-horse of the\r\nwhale-fishers. It corresponds in several of its characters both with\r\nthe bullock and the whale. It grows to the bulk of an ox. Its canine\r\nteeth, two in number, are of the length externally of ten to twenty\r\ninches, (some naturalists say three feet,) and extend downward from\r\nthe upper jaw, and include the point of the lower jaw between them.\r\nThey are incurvated inward. Their full length when cut out of the\r\nskull is commonly fifteen to twenty inches, sometimes almost thirty,\r\nand their weight five to ten pounds each or upward. The walrus\r\nbeing a slow clumsy animal on land, its tusk seems necessary for\r\nits defence against the bear, and also for enabling it to raise its\r\nunwieldy body upon the ice when its access to the shore is prevented.\r\n\r\nThe walrus is found on the shores of Spitzbergen twelve to fifteen\r\nfeet in length, and eight to ten feet in circumference. The head is\r\nshort, small, and flattened in front. The flattened part of the face\r\nis set with strong bristles. The nostrils are on the upper part of\r\nthe snout, through which it blows like a whale. The fore paws, which\r\nare a kind of webbed hand, are two-sevenths of the full length of\r\nthe animal from the snout. They are from two to two and a half feet\r\nin length, and being expansive maybe stretched to the breadth of\r\nfifteen to eighteen inches. The hind feet, which form a sort of tail\r\nfin, extend straight backward. They are not united, but detached from\r\neach other. The length of each is about two to two and a half feet;\r\nthe breadth, when fully extended, two and a half or three feet; the\r\ntermination of each toe is marked by a small tail.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the walrus is about an inch thick, and it is covered with\r\na short, yellowish brown coloured hair. The inside of the paws in\r\nold animals is defended by a rough, horny kind of casing, a quarter\r\nof an inch thick, probably produced by the hardening of the skin in\r\nconsequence of coarse usage in climbing over ice and rocks.\r\n\r\nBeneath the skin is a thin layer of fat. At some seasons the produce\r\nis said to be considerable, but I have never met with any that\r\nafforded above twenty or thirty gallons of oil. In the stomachs\r\nof walruses I have met with shrimps, a kind of craw-fish, and the\r\nremains of young seals.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all improbable that the walrus has afforded foundation\r\nfor some of the stories of mermaids. I have myself seen a sea-horse\r\nin such a position, that it requires little stretch of imagination\r\nto mistake it for a human being; so like, indeed, was it, that the\r\nsurgeon of the ship actually reported to me that he had seen a man\r\nwith his head just appearing above the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe walrus is a fearless animal. It pays no regard to a boat,\r\nexcepting as an object of curiosity. It is sometimes taken by a\r\nharpoon when in the water. If one attack fails, it often affords\r\nan opportunity for repeating it. The capture cannot be always\r\naccomplished without danger, for, as they go in herds, an attack\r\nmade upon one individual draws all its companions to its defence. In\r\nsuch cases they frequently rally round the boat from which the blow\r\nwas struck, pierce its planks with their tusks, and, though resisted\r\nin the most determined manner, sometimes raise themselves upon the\r\ngunwale, and threaten to overset it. The best defence against these\r\nenraged animals is, in such a crisis, sea-sand, which, being thrown\r\ninto their eyes, occasions a partial blindness, and obliges them to\r\ndisperse. When on shore they are best killed with long sharp-pointed\r\nknives.\r\n\r\nThe tusks of the walrus, which are hard, white, and compact ivory,\r\nare employed by dentists in the fabrication of false teeth. The\r\nskin is used in place of mats for defending the yards and rigging\r\nof ships from being chafed by friction against each other. When\r\ncut into shreds and plaited into cordage, it answers admirably for\r\nwheel-ropes, being stronger and wearing much longer than hemp. In\r\nancient times, most of the ropes of ships, in northern countries\r\nat least, would appear to have been made of this substance. When\r\ntanned, it is converted into a soft porous leather, above an inch in\r\nthickness, but it is by no means so useful or so durable as in its\r\ngreen or raw state.\r\n\r\nAs early as the ninth century, we have accounts of the walrus being\r\nextensively fished for on the western coast of Norway. Prior to the\r\ninstitution of the Spitzbergen whale-fishery, the capture of this\r\nanimal was an object of some commercial importance. It was at first\r\nattacked by the English, on Cherie Island, but being driven from\r\nthence, if not extirpated in that quarter, by the great slaughter\r\nthat was carried on, it was then pursued to Spitzbergen. The earliest\r\nattacks made on it were very unsuccessful, but experience rendered\r\nthe assailants more skilful, and, in one voyage, nine hundred or\r\none thousand sea-horses were killed in less than seven hours. The\r\nRussians now, rather than the British, are their enemies.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the head, the general form of the walrus is\r\nsimilar to the next animal which we describe, the phoca, or seal.\r\n\r\nSeveral species of seals occur in the Greenland Sea, and resort\r\nto the ice in the neighbourhood of Spitzbergen and Jan Mayen, in\r\nimmense herds; but, as the seal frequents the British coast, and is a\r\nwell-described and well-known animal, I shall not particularize the\r\nwell-known species that are met with in the Arctic Seas. Some few\r\ngeneral observations only will be necessary.\r\n\r\nSeals are generally fat in the spring of the year, and afford several\r\ngallons of blubber; even small seals will then yield about four or\r\nfive gallons of oil. The voice of the young seal when in pain or\r\ndistress is a whining cry, resembling that of a child. They appear\r\nto hear well under water; music, or particularly a person whistling,\r\ndraws them to the surface, and induces them to stretch their necks\r\nto the utmost extent, so as to prove a snare by bringing them within\r\nreach of the shooter. The most effectual way of shooting them is by\r\nthe use of small shot, fired into their eyes; when killed with a\r\nbullet they generally sink, and are lost. Seals are often seen on\r\ntheir passage from one situation to another in very large shoals.\r\nTheir general conduct in such cases is such as to amuse spectators,\r\nand the sailors call such a shoal a “seal’s wedding.” The feet of\r\nseals are better adapted for motion in the water than on land. They\r\nfeed on birds, crabs, and small fishes, and are very tenacious of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe uses of the seal are various, and to some nations highly\r\nimportant. It yields train-oil, and its skin is extensively employed\r\nin making shoes, and, when dressed with the hair, in covering trunks.\r\nTo the Esquimaux the seal is everything. Its flesh is food, its fat\r\ngives light, and its skin, dressed so as to be waterproof, is used\r\nfor covering for boats and tents, and for garments.\r\n\r\nThe _Phoca vitulina_ is the common species in the Greenland\r\nSea, especially near Jan Mayen. The hooded seal is common near\r\nSpitzbergen. The latter is longer than the former, and is said to\r\ngrow to the length of ten or twelve feet. It is also much more\r\nformidable. Seals are not fond of the water, but, when on the ice,\r\nare extremely watchful, and secure their retreat either by reclining\r\nat the edge or by keeping a hole in the ice open for them. The young\r\nones, however, are not so wary as the old folks. The best situation\r\nfor the seal-fishery in the Arctic Sea is in the vicinity of Jan\r\nMayen, and the best season March and April. The capture of the\r\nseal is the work of a moment. A blow with a seal-club on the nose\r\nimmediately stuns it, and affords opportunity of making a prize\r\nof many at a time. Ships fitted out for the whale-fishery have\r\naccidentally obtained in April from two thousand to three thousand\r\nseals, and sometimes more; and vessels sent out for seal-fishery\r\nonly, four thousand or five thousand, yielding nearly one hundred\r\ntons of oil. From the ports of the Elbe and Weser a number of sealers\r\nare annually dispatched, but few comparatively on this pursuit alone\r\nsail from Britain.\r\n\r\nOf the dangers of the seal-fishery, arising from the liability to\r\nheavy storms at the season and in the place where seals are taken,\r\nthe following narrative will furnish full illustration.\r\n\r\nFifty-four ships, chiefly Hamburghers, were, in the year 1774, fitted\r\nout for seal-fishery alone from foreign ports. In the spring of\r\nthe year they met with several English ships on the borders of the\r\nice, about sixty miles to the eastward of the island of Jan Mayen.\r\nWhile the boats of the fleet were in search for seals, a dreadful\r\nstorm suddenly arose. Almost all the people who were at a distance\r\nfrom the ships perished. The Duke of York, captain Peters, had two\r\nboats at that time down. The crews of these by great exertion rowed\r\nup to the ship, got hold of the rudder rings, but were unable to\r\nmake their way alongside; they held fast for some time, but the sea\r\nwas too strong for them, and they lost their hold and fell astern.\r\nThe chief-mate of the ship, seeing that they were too exhausted to\r\nrecover their position, determined to attempt their rescue at the\r\nperil of his own life. He manned a boat with six stout seamen beside\r\nhimself, and went to their assistance. On reaching them he exchanged\r\nfour of his vigorous crew for two of the fainting men in each boat.\r\nThus reinforced, the three boats, by the exertions of their crews,\r\nwere brought to the stern of the ship; but while in this critical\r\nsituation, a sea struck the boats, filled and overwhelmed them, on\r\nwhich the whole of their crews, nineteen men, perished. This was only\r\na portion of the disasters of the storm. One ship foundered in a\r\nheavy surge, and all hands were lost. Another was wrecked on the ice,\r\nand all hands perished. Many boats and men were washed from several\r\nothers, and the results were that about four hundred foreign seamen,\r\nand two hundred British, were drowned, four or five ships lost, and\r\nscarcely any escaped without damage.\r\n\r\nTo all those who navigate the treacherous ocean, especially to such\r\nas do business in such dangerous waters, it ought to be of more than\r\nordinary importance to live in a continued preparation for death and\r\njudgment, and to be the servants of that God who\r\n\r\n      “—— rides upon the stormy sky\r\n        And manages the seas.”\r\n\r\nBeneath his care the mariner is safe, and whether from the abysses of\r\nits ancient caves, or the foundations of its lofty icebergs, the sea\r\nmust surrender unto eternal life the bodies of the disciples of Jesus.\r\n\r\nThe Arctic fox, _Canis lagopus_, is an animal known to those who\r\nwinter in Spitzbergen, though seldom seen by the whale-fishers.\r\nThey are rarely found on the ice, though I have often found their\r\nimpressions on the snow. They are of a white colour, and not easily\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nA more remarkable animal is the Polar or Greenland bear, _Ursus\r\nmaritimus_. He is the sovereign of the quadrupeds of the Arctic\r\ncountries. He is powerful and courageous; savage and sagacious;\r\napparently clumsy, yet not inactive. His senses are extremely acute,\r\nespecially his sight and smell. As he traverses extensive fields\r\nof ice, he mounts the hummocks and looks for prey, and on rearing\r\nhis head and snuffing the breeze, he can perceive the scent of the\r\ncarrion of the whale at an immense distance. Seals are his usual\r\nfood, but from their watchfulness he is often obliged to fast. He is\r\nas much at home on the ice as on the land, and is found on field-ice\r\nabove two hundred miles from shore. He can swim with the velocity of\r\nthree miles an hour, and can dive to a considerable distance.\r\n\r\nBears occur in Spitzbergen, Nova Zembla, Greenland, and other Arctic\r\ncountries, throughout the year. In some places, they are met with in\r\ngreat numbers. By means of the ice, they often effect a landing on\r\nIceland, but as soon as they appear, they are generally attacked by\r\nthe inhabitants and destroyed. On the east coast of Greenland, they\r\nhave appeared like flocks of sheep on a common.\r\n\r\nThe size of the bear is generally four or five feet in height, seven\r\nor eight in length, and nearly as much in circumference. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, the size is much larger. His paws are seven inches in\r\nbreadth, and his claws two inches in length. His canine teeth,\r\nexclusive of the part in the jaw, are about an inch and a half in\r\nlength. He has been known by the strength of his jaw to bite a lance\r\nin two, though made of iron half an inch in diameter. In the water\r\nhe can be captured without much danger, but on land the experiment\r\nis hazardous. When pursued and attacked, he turns upon his enemies.\r\nHe always, however, unless urged by hunger, retreats before men.\r\nHis general walk is slow, but upon the ice he can easily outrun any\r\nman. If struck with a lance, he is apt to seize it in his mouth,\r\nand either bite it in two, or wrest it out of the hand. If shot\r\nwith a ball, unless he is struck in the head, in the heart, or in\r\nthe shoulder, he is enraged rather than depressed, and falls with\r\nincreased power upon his pursuers. When shot at a distance, and\r\nable to escape, he has been observed to retire to the shelter of a\r\nhummock, and, as if conscious of the styptical effect of cold, apply\r\nsnow with his paws to the wound.\r\n\r\nThe bear feeds on the kreng, or carcases of the whales, as they are\r\nleft by the fishers; on seals, birds, foxes, and deer, when it can\r\nsurprise them; on eggs, and indeed on any animal substance that comes\r\nwithin its power. The skin of the bear, when dressed with the hair\r\non, forms beautiful mats for a hall or for the bottom of a carriage.\r\nPrepared without being ripped up, and the hairy side turned inward,\r\nit forms a very warm sack bed, and is used as such in some parts of\r\nGreenland. The flesh, when cleared of the fat, is well flavoured and\r\nsavoury, especially the muscular part of the ham. I once treated my\r\nsurgeon with a dinner of bears ham, and he did not know for above\r\na month afterwards, but that it was beefsteak. The liver is very\r\nunwholesome.\r\n\r\nBears are remarkably affectionate towards their young, and peculiarly\r\nsagacious. The female has generally two at a birth. On one occasion,\r\na mother bear with two cubs was pursued across a field of ice by\r\na party of armed sailors. At first, she urged her young ones to\r\nincrease their speed, but finding the pursuers gaining on them,\r\nshe carried or pushed or pitched them alternately forward, until\r\nshe effected their escape. The little creatures are said to have\r\nplaced themselves across her path to receive her impulse, and when\r\nthrown forward they ran on till she overtook them, when they adjusted\r\nthemselves for a second throw.\r\n\r\nMany instances have been observed of the peculiar sagacity of these\r\nanimals. A seal, lying on the middle of a large piece of ice, with\r\na hole just before it, was marked out by a bear for its prey, and\r\nsecured by the artifice of diving under the ice, and making its way\r\nto the hole by which the seal was prepared to retreat. The seal,\r\nhowever, observed its approach, and plunged into the water, but\r\nthe bear instantly sprang upon it, and appeared in about a minute\r\nafterwards with the seal in its mouth.\r\n\r\nThe captain of one of the whalers being anxious to procure a bear\r\nwithout wounding the skin, made trial of the stratagem of laying the\r\nnoose of a rope in the snow, and placing a piece of kreng within it.\r\nA bear, ranging the neighbouring ice, was soon enticed to the spot\r\nby the smell of burning meat. He perceived the bait, approached, and\r\nseized it in his mouth, but his foot, at the same moment, by a jerk\r\nof the rope being entangled in the noose, he pushed it off with the\r\nadjoining paw, and deliberately retired. After having eaten the piece\r\nhe carried away with him he returned. The noose, with another piece\r\nof kreng, being then replaced, he pushed the rope aside, and again\r\nwalked triumphantly off with the kreng. A third time the noose was\r\nlaid, and this time the rope was buried in the snow and the bait laid\r\nin a deep hole dug in the centre. But Bruin, after snuffing about the\r\nplace for a few minutes, scraped the snow away with his paw, threw\r\nthe rope aside, and escaped unhurt with his prize.\r\n\r\nIn the month of June, 1812, a female bear, with two cubs, approached\r\nthe ship I commanded, and was shot. The cubs, not attempting to\r\nescape, were taken alive. These animals, though at first evidently\r\nvery unhappy, became at length, in some measure, reconciled to their\r\nsituation, and being tolerably tame, were allowed occasionally to go\r\nat large about the deck. While the ship was moored to a floe, a few\r\ndays after they were taken, one of them, having a rope fastened round\r\nits neck, was thrown overboard. It immediately swam to the ice, got\r\nupon it, and attempted to escape. Finding itself, however, detained\r\nby the rope, it endeavoured to disengage itself in the following\r\ningenious way:—Near the edge of the floe was a crack in the ice, of\r\nconsiderable length, but only eighteen inches or two feet wide, and\r\nthree or four feet deep. To this spot the bear returned; and when,\r\non crossing the chasm, the bight of the rope fell into it, he placed\r\nhimself across the opening; then, suspending himself by his hind\r\nfeet, with a leg on each side, he dropped his head and most of his\r\nbody into the chasm, and, with a foot applied to each side of the\r\nneck, attempted for some minutes to push the rope over his head.\r\nFinding this scheme ineffectual, he removed to the main ice, and\r\nrunning with great impetuosity from the ship, gave a remarkable pull\r\non the rope; then, going backward a few steps, he repeated the jerk.\r\nAt length, after repeated attempts to escape this way, every failure\r\nof which he announced by a significant growl, he yielded himself\r\nto his hard necessity, and lay down on the ice in angry and sullen\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nAccidents with bears occasionally occur; not so many, however, as\r\nthe ferocity of these animals, and the temerity of the sailors,\r\nmight lead one to expect. Some of the early voyagers to the Polar\r\nSeas had hard conflicts with them. Barentz’s crew especially were\r\noften in danger from them, but always succeeded either in conquering\r\nor repelling them. Two, however, of the crew of a vessel which had\r\nanchored near Nova Zembla, landed on an island at the mouth of\r\nthe Weigats, and, impelled by curiosity, wandered some distance\r\nfrom the beach; but, whilst unconscious of danger, one of them was\r\nsuddenly seized on the back by a bear, and brought to the earth. His\r\ncompanion ran off, and gave the alarm, and a party of his shipmates\r\ncame to their assistance. The bear stood over its prey during their\r\napproach without the least appearance of fear and, on their attack,\r\nsprang upon one of their number, and made him also a victim to its\r\nferocity and power. The rest now fled in confusion, and could not\r\nbe induced to renew the conflict. Three sailors only among the crew\r\nhad sufficient courage to combat with this formidable animal; they\r\nattacked it, and, after a dangerous struggle, killed it, and rescued\r\nthe mangled bodies of their two unfortunate shipmates.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cook, of the Archangel, of Lynn, being near the coast of\r\nSpitzbergen, in the year 1788, landed, accompanied by his surgeon\r\nand mate. While traversing the shore, the captain was unexpectedly\r\nattacked by a bear, which seized him in an instant between its\r\npaws. At this awful juncture, when a moment’s pause must have been\r\nfatal to him, he called to his surgeon to fire; who, with admirable\r\nresolution and steadiness, discharged his piece as directed, and\r\nprovidentially shot the bear through the head. The captain, by this\r\nprompt assistance, was preserved from being torn to pieces.\r\n\r\nOn a more recent occasion, a commander of a whale ship was in a\r\nsimilar danger. Captain Hawkins, of the Everthorpe, of Hull, when\r\nin Davis’s Strait, in July, 1818, seeing a very large bear, took a\r\nboat, and pushed off in pursuit of it. On reaching it, the captain\r\nstruck it twice with a lance in the breast; and, while in the act of\r\nrecovering his weapon for another blow, the enraged animal sprang\r\nup, and seized him by the thigh, and threw him over its head into\r\nthe water. Fortunately it did not repeat its attack, but exerted\r\nitself to escape. This exertion, when the attention of every one was\r\ndirected towards their captain, was not made in vain, for it was\r\nallowed to swim away without further molestation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to curious adventures, on one occasion a bear, which was\r\nattacked by a boat’s crew, made such formidable resistance, that it\r\nwas enabled to climb the side of the boat and take possession of it,\r\nwhile the intimidated crew fled for safety to the water, supporting\r\nthemselves by the gunwale and rings of the boat, until, by the\r\nassistance of another party from the ship it was shot, as it sat\r\ninoffensively in the stern. With regard to narrow escapes, a sailor,\r\nwho was pursued on a field of ice by a bear, when at a considerable\r\ndistance from assistance, preserved his life by throwing down an\r\narticle of clothing whenever the bear gained upon him, on which it\r\nalways suspended the pursuit until it had examined it, and thus gave\r\nhim time to obtain some advance. In this way, by means of a hat, a\r\njacket, and a neckerchief, successively cast down, the progress of\r\nthe bear was retarded, and the sailor escaped from the danger that\r\nthreatened him, in the refuge afforded him by his vessel.\r\n\r\nThe rein-deer, _Cervus tarandus_, deserves to be mentioned amongst\r\nthe quadrupeds of the Arctic regions. I have never seen one myself,\r\nthough it is known to inhabit almost every part of Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nOur remarks must now be directed to the _Birds_ which frequent the\r\nsea and coast of Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nThe brent goose and eider duck, _Anas bernicla_ and _Anas\r\nmollissima_, are found in these regions; the former occurring\r\nin considerable numbers near the coast of Greenland, but not in\r\nSpitzbergen, and the latter frequenting all the islands in the\r\nGreenland Sea. The puffin, or Greenland parrot, _Alca arctica_,\r\nfeeding on shrimps, is rarely seen out of sight of land, but is very\r\ncommon near the coast of Spitzbergen. _Alca alle_, also, the little\r\nauk or roach, is an extremely numerous species in some situations in\r\nthe Polar Seas. They occur in the water in thousands together, and\r\nsometimes in like abundance on the pieces of ice. They dive quickly\r\non being alarmed, and on the approach of thick weather they are\r\nparticularly noisy.\r\n\r\nThe fulmar, _Procellaria glacialis_, is the constant companion of\r\nthe whale-fisher. It joins his ship immediately on passing the\r\nShetland Islands, and accompanies it through the trackless ocean\r\nto the highest accessible latitudes. It keeps an eager watch for\r\nanything thrown overboard; the smallest particle of fatty substance\r\ncan scarcely escape it. As such, a hook baited with a piece of fat\r\nmeat or blubber, and towed by a long twine over the ship’s stern, is\r\na means employed by the sailor-boys for taking them. In the spring\r\nof the year, before they have glutted themselves with the fat of the\r\nwhale, they are pretty good eating. They are remarkably easy and\r\nswift on the wing, and can fly to windward in the highest storms.\r\nThough very few fulmars should be seen when a whale is about being\r\ncaptured, yet, as soon as the flensing commences, they rush in\r\nfrom all quarters, and seize, with great audacity, all the pieces\r\nof fat that come in their way. They frequently glut themselves so\r\ncompletely as to be unable to fly, in which case, when not relieved\r\nby a quantity being disgorged, they rest on the ice until restored\r\nby digestion. The fulmar is a bold and very hardy bird. Its feathers\r\nbeing thick, it is not easily killed with a blow. Its bite, from the\r\ncrookedness, strength, and sharpness of its bill, is very severe.\r\nFulmars differ in colour; some are a dirty grey, others much paler,\r\nand totally white on the breast and belly. In size this bird is a\r\nlittle smaller than a duck. Beneath its feathers is a thick bed of\r\nfine grey down. When carrion is scarce, the fulmar sometimes points\r\nout the whale to the fisher by following in its track. They cannot\r\nmake much impression on the dead whale until some more powerful\r\nanimal tears away the skin.\r\n\r\nThe tysté, or doveca, _Colymbus grylle_, is a beautifully formed\r\nbird, occurring in considerable numbers in icy situations, at various\r\ndistances from land. It is so watchful, and so quick at diving, that,\r\nif fired at without precaution to conceal the flash of the powder, it\r\ngenerally escapes the shot. It feeds on shrimps and small fishes. The\r\ncommon colour is black, but the feet are all red.\r\n\r\nAlmost equally common with the preceding is the _Colymbus troile_,\r\na clumsy bird, weighing two pounds or upwards, and measuring only\r\nsixteen or seventeen inches in length, and twenty-eight inches across\r\nthe wings, when full spread, in breadth. It cannot rise on the\r\nwing in any direction except to windward. If it attempts to fly to\r\nleeward, it runs for a considerable distance along the surface of the\r\nwater, and at length falls into it. Both in this instance and that of\r\nthe doveca, shortness of tail is compensated for by the feet, which\r\nare used as a rudder in flying. The _Colymbus glacialis_ was seen by\r\ncaptain Phipps on the coast of Spitzbergen.\r\n\r\nThe sea-swallow, or great tern, _Sterna hirundo_, is an elegant bird,\r\ncommon on the shore of Spitzbergen, but is not met with at a distance\r\nfrom land. Its length is seven or eight inches, and including the\r\ntail fourteen, and the spread of its wings twenty-nine or thirty\r\ninches. It flies with great ease and swiftness, and to a considerable\r\nheight. It defends its eggs and young with great boldness from the\r\nArctic gull, and even descends within a yard of the head of any\r\nperson who ventures to molest them, startling him with its loud\r\nscreams. It lays its eggs among the shingle of the beach above\r\nhigh-water mark, where the full power of the sun falls.\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of the gull tribe. The kittywake, _Larus\r\nrissa_, is seen in every part of the northern Atlantic from Britain\r\nto the highest latitudes. It is a better fisher than its enemy, the\r\nArctic gull, _Larus parasiticus_, by whom it is pursued until it\r\ngives up the food it has procured. The latter kind of gull lives at\r\nthe expense of its neighbours, preying upon their eggs and their\r\nyoung. _Larus crepidatus_ and _Larus eburneus_ are other varieties.\r\nThe latter, remarkable for its immaculate whiteness, is as ravenous\r\nas the fulmar. _Larus glaucus_, burgomaster, is the chief magistrate\r\nof the feathered tribe in the Spitzbergen regions, as none of its\r\nclass dare dispute its authority, or refuse at its bidding to\r\nsurrender their prey. It is a large and powerful bird, twenty-eight\r\ninches in length, and five inches in breadth across the wings. The\r\nkittywake, snow-bird, and burgomaster, are sometimes shot for the\r\nsake of their feathers. The two latter species are very shy. They\r\nare shot with the greatest ease, however, from a house built of snow\r\non the ice. The _Tringa hypoleucos_, sandpiper, and the _Emberiza\r\nnivalis_, snow-bunting, are inhabitants also of these regions. A bird\r\nof great delicacy and smallness is _Fringilla linaria_, the lesser\r\nredpole. On our approach to Spitzbergen, several of this species\r\nalighted on the ship, and were, apparently, so wearied by flight\r\nthat they allowed themselves to be taken alive. It is difficult to\r\nunderstand how this small bird manages to perform the journey from\r\nSpitzbergen to a milder climate, without becoming exhausted and\r\nperishing by the way.\r\n\r\nThe _Amphibia_, _Fishes_, _Animalcules_, etc., must conclude our\r\nsketch of the zoology of the Arctic regions.\r\n\r\nIn the class _Amphibia_, the most notable personage is the Greenland\r\nshark, _Squalus borealis_. It has not, I believe, been described.\r\nThe ventral fins are separate. It is without anal fin, but has the\r\ntemporal opening, and it belongs, therefore, to the third division of\r\nthe genus. The spiracles on the neck are five in number on each side.\r\nThe colour is cinereous grey. The eyes are the most extraordinary\r\npart of the animal. The pupil is emerald green, the rest of the\r\neye blue. To the posterior edge of the pupil is attached a white\r\nvermiform substance, one or two inches in length. Each extremity of\r\nit consists of two filaments, but the central part is single. The\r\nsailors imagine this shark is blind, because it pays not the least\r\nattention to the presence of a man, and is, indeed, so apparently\r\nstupid, that it never draws back when a blow is aimed at it with a\r\nknife or a lance. It is twelve or fourteen feet in length, and six or\r\neight feet in circumference, and in general form very much resembles\r\nthe dog-fish. It is one of the foes of the whale. It bites and annoys\r\nit when living, and feeds on it when dead. With its teeth, which are\r\nserrated in one jaw, and lancet-shaped and denticulated in the other,\r\nit scoops out of the body of the whale pieces as large as a person’s\r\nhead, and continues scooping and gorging till its belly is filled.\r\nIt is so insensible to pain that, though run through the body with a\r\nknife, it will return to its food, and for some hours after its heart\r\nis taken out, or its body cut in pieces, they will continue to show\r\nsigns of life. It does not, so far as I am aware, attack the fishers.\r\n\r\nIn the class _Pisces_, _Gadus carbonarius_, the coal-fish, was\r\nprocured by captain Phipps, as also of the former class, _Cyclopterus\r\nliparis_, during his stay in the vicinity of Spitzbergen. _Mullus\r\nbarbatus_ was taken out of the mouth of a seal by a seaman, near\r\nSpitzbergen. It was boiled by our officers, and proved an excellent\r\ndish.\r\n\r\nIn the class _Articulata_ are one or two species of _gammarus_. The\r\n_G. arcticus_ of Leach, the actions of which suggest as a familiar\r\nname, the mountebank shrimp. There are also various crabs, and the\r\n_Oniscus ceti_ of Linnæus, or whale’s louse. This little animal is\r\nabout half an inch in diameter, and firmly fixes itself by hooked\r\nclaws on the skin of the mysticetus. It is found under the fin, and\r\nwherever the skin is tender, and it is not likely to be dislodged. A\r\nsimilar animal, though smaller, is found on the body of the narwal.\r\n\r\nIn the class _Vermes_ are several species found in various animals\r\ninhabiting the northern seas. The sea-snail, _Clio helicina_, is an\r\nanimal covered with a delicately beautiful sheet, similar to that of\r\nthe nautilus. The diameter is from two-eighths to three-eighths of an\r\ninch. It is found in great quantities near the coast of Spitzbergen.\r\nThe _Clio borealis_ occurs in vast numbers in some situations near\r\nSpitzbergen, but is not found generally in the Arctic Seas. In\r\nswimming, it brings the tips of its fins almost into contact, first\r\noil one side and then on another. I kept several of them alive in a\r\nglass of sea-water for about, a month, when they gradually wasted\r\naway and died.\r\n\r\nThe cuttle-fish, _Sepia_, were found by me in large numbers in the\r\nstomachs of the narwals.\r\n\r\nMore than six or seven kinds of _Medusæ_ may be distinguished,\r\namong which may be named, _Medusa pileus_, and the purse-shaped,\r\nbottle-shaped, and orange-coloured _medusæ_. _Medusa pileus_ is one\r\nof the most curious of the tribe. It consists of eight lobes, with a\r\nbeautiful, irridescent, finny fringe on the external edge of each. A\r\ncanal, four-fifths the length of the animal, penetrates the centre\r\nof it, and two red cirrhi, which may be extended to the length of\r\nnearly a foot, proceed from a crooked cavity in opposite sides. The\r\nanimal is semi-transparent, the colour white, and the finny fringes\r\nof deeper red. It is found of various sizes.\r\n\r\nThe substance of the purse-shaped medusa is tougher than that of any\r\nother species which I have examined. It has one large open cavity,\r\nand is divided by the finny fringes into eight segments, each\r\nalternate pair of which are similar. The colour is a pale crimson,\r\nwith waved purple lines, and the finny fringes deeper crimson. The\r\nanimal appeared to be almost without sensation. The only evidence it\r\ngave of feeling was in an increased vibration of the finny fringes.\r\nThough it was cut into pieces, each portion on which there was any\r\nof the fringe continued, by its incessant play, to give evidence of\r\nlife during two or three days, after which it became putrescent, and\r\nbegan to waste away. I have only seen one specimen of this and of\r\nthe orange-coloured medusa. The colour of the latter was a brilliant\r\norange, and it was not transparent. It was not tenacious of life,\r\nhaving died, to appearance, soon after it was taken.\r\n\r\nThe Greenland Sea, frozen and extensive as it is, teems with life.\r\nThe variety of the animal creation is not, indeed, very great, but\r\nthe quantity of some of the species that occur is truly immense. The\r\nminute medusæ and animalcules, throughout the Spitzbergen Sea, would\r\nexceed all the powers of the mind to conceive. These little creatures\r\nconstitute the food of the largest animals in the creation. The\r\ncommon whale feeds on medusæ, sepiæ, cancri, actiniæ, etc., and these\r\nfeed, probably, on the minor medusæ animalcules. The fin-whales and\r\ndolphins feed principally on herrings and other small fishes. These\r\nsubsist on the smaller cancri, medusæ, and animalcules. The bear’s\r\nmost general food is the seal; the seal subsists on the cancri and\r\nsmall fishes, and these on lesser animals of the tribe, or on the\r\nminor medusæ and animalcules. Thus the whole of the larger animals\r\ndepend on these minute beings, which, until the year 1816, when\r\nI first entered on the examination of the sea-water, were not, I\r\nbelieve, known to exist in the Polar Seas.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these minute animals are preserved, in a sea\r\nwhich is surrounded by an atmosphere ten or twelve degrees in mean\r\ntemperature below the freezing point of salt water, is curious and\r\ninteresting, and illustrates the combined wisdom and goodness of the\r\nLawgiver of these icy regions, as well as of the entire globe. If the\r\nwater of the sea were stationary, the temperature of the atmosphere\r\nwould soon freeze it to the very bottom, and destroy all these minute\r\nanimals, who have not either instinct or power of motion to retire\r\ninto a more southern region. A current, however, is provided,\r\nsetting towards the south-west, which carries away the ice into a\r\nparallel where it can be dissolved, and creates a circulation of\r\nwater into the frozen regions from a warmer climate; while therefore\r\nthe superficial current is carrying away the ice, an under-current,\r\nin a contrary direction, is bringing in warmth beneath. But how, it\r\nmay be asked, does it happen that the minor medusæ are not carried\r\naway into the southern region? It is no violation of commonly\r\nreceived principles to suppose, that whenever the medusæ are carried\r\nto some extent southward, they sink in the water until they reach the\r\nstream of the under-current, and are by it conveyed to their proper\r\nelement. The fact that the olive-green water of the sea maintains a\r\nsimilar position for years together, while surface after surface of\r\nice is carried away and dissipated, is in support of this conjecture.\r\nThus, by a most beautiful contrivance, a large portion of the\r\nsurface of the globe is rendered habitable, which would otherwise\r\nbe a solid mass of ice, and the Polar Sea affords a dwelling-place\r\nfor many tribes of animals most useful in supplying the wants, and\r\ncontributing to the comfort, of man.\r\n\r\nIt is not only, therefore, in those regions where\r\n\r\n      “Spices breathe and milder seasons smile,”\r\n\r\nbut even in the laws of a less genial climate, that we are called\r\nupon to observe His eternal power and godhead, who gives the\r\nbounties of his providence to the just and the unjust, and pleads\r\nwith us, in the gospel of his Son, that we should be reconciled\r\nto him. The mighty whale, the ephemeral insect, and the minute\r\nanimalcule, all the productions of his power and skill, have their\r\nwants supplied by his laws, and are subject to his control. In these\r\nhe displays the strength of his arm, and the adaptations of his\r\nwisdom, but in man, redeemed and sanctified, “the exceeding riches\r\nof his grace.” Happy, indeed, are we, if whilst, with the ancient\r\npsalmist, we can proclaim that the earth is full of the goodness of\r\nthe Lord, “who gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap,”\r\nand “layeth up the depth in store-houses,” we can also, without\r\npresumption, through our union with the great heir of all things, the\r\nLord Jesus, and by the merit of his life and death, honestly declare\r\nall things are ours, whether ... the world, or life, or death, or\r\nthings present, or things to come, all are ours, and we are Christ’s,\r\nand Christ is God’s.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nEXPEDITIONS FOR FURTHER DISCOVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving now completed the account of the Arctic Regions, as given by\r\ncaptain Scoresby, it may be interesting to the reader to have a brief\r\nstatement of some of the principal expeditions for further discovery\r\ndown to the present time.\r\n\r\nIn 1819, lieutenant Parry sailed with the Hecla and Griper. The\r\nobject of his expedition was to examine the great and open bay, known\r\nas sir J. Lancaster’s Sound; and, in case of failure, the Sound of\r\nalderman Jones, and that of sir T. Smith. On the 1st of August, the\r\nships entered the Sound of sir J. Lancaster, and ran quickly up it,\r\nfinding no land across the bottom of the inlet, but arriving at a\r\nstrait, which they named Barrow’s Strait, and a magnificent opening\r\ninto which it led, Wellington Channel. On the 4th of September, the\r\nexpedition crossed the meridian of 110° west longitude, in latitude\r\n74° 44′, becoming entitled to a reward of £5,000. They anchored, and\r\nput into winter-quarters at Melville Island, losing sight of the sun\r\nfrom 11th November till the 3rd of February, when it became once more\r\nvisible from the Hecla’s main-top. With the greatest difficulty,\r\nthey managed to escape from the ice during the months of August and\r\nSeptember, arriving at the Orkneys 28th October, 1820.\r\n\r\nThe second voyage of Parry was with the Fury and Hecla. His\r\ninstructions were to proceed towards, or into, Hudson’s Strait, to\r\npenetrate to the westward through that strait, until he should reach\r\nsome portion of the coast of the continent of America. The object was\r\nto discover a way westward from the Atlantic into the Pacific Ocean.\r\nThe vessels left the Nore 8th May, 1821, and arrived at Resolution\r\nIsland, at the entrance of Hudson’s Strait, on 2nd July, attempted\r\nthe direct passage through the Frozen Strait, and passed through it\r\ninto Repulse Bay. From it no passage was found to the west, and the\r\nships, after beating about to no profit, were compelled to winter\r\nnear Lyon’s Inlet. Here the dreariness of the winter was relieved by\r\ninterviews with the inhabitants, who were found to be intelligent\r\nand honest. On 2nd July, the ships left their winter-quarters, and,\r\nafter being exposed to the most fearful dangers, arrived at a strait,\r\ncalled by Parry, the Strait of the Fury and Hecla, and believed by\r\nhim to be an opening into the Polar Sea. The ships again went into\r\nwinter-quarters, and were frozen in until late in the following year,\r\nbut arrived at Lerwick on October 10th, 1823.\r\n\r\nThe same ships, under the same commander, sailed on a third\r\nexpedition in May, 1824, having for its object to penetrate through\r\nLancaster Sound, Barrow’s Strait, and Prince Regent’s Inlet, to the\r\nwestward. Through detention by the ice, they did not arrive at\r\nLancaster Sound till 10th September, and went into winter-quarters on\r\nthe 27th, in Prince Regent’s Inlet, at Port Bowen. On the breaking up\r\nof the ice, they explored, southerly, close to the westward shore;\r\nbut by the accidents to which they were exposed, they were compelled\r\nto abandon the Fury, with her stores, and the Hecla only returned to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn 1827, captain Parry proposed to reach the North Pole by means of\r\ntravelling with sledge-boats over the ice. Two boats were constructed\r\nfor the purpose, the one to be commanded by Parry, the other by\r\nlieutenant Ross. They proceeded in the Hecla to Spitzbergen, and\r\nthere left the ship, starting in their sledge-boats with seventy-one\r\ndays’ provisions. They travelled by night rather than by day; found\r\nthe ice very rough, and in some places tender; and after experiencing\r\ngreat difficulties, arrived only at latitude 82° 45′, and were\r\ncompelled to abandon the undertaking as hopeless.\r\n\r\nCaptain John Franklin received instructions to explore the northern\r\ncoast of America, from the mouth of Copper Mine River to the\r\neastward. He sailed on 22nd May, 1819, in a ship of the Hudson’s\r\nBay Company. They arrived at York Factory, in Hudson’s Bay, on 30th\r\nAugust. Their route was to be by Cumberland House, and through a\r\nchain of posts to the Great Slave Lake. At Cumberland House, it was\r\narranged that Franklin and others should proceed at once on to the\r\nAthobasca department, to the northward of the Great Slave Lake, and\r\nthat the rest of the party should follow in the spring. The place of\r\nmeeting was Fort Chepewyan, eight hundred and fifty-seven miles from\r\nCumberland House; and, by the 20th August, they had advanced to Fort\r\nEnterprise, five hundred and fifty miles from Chepewyan. Here they\r\nwintered, and were exposed to awful hardships; but, on the arrival\r\nof the spring, they prosecuted their journey down the Copper Mine\r\nRiver, reaching the Polar Sea on the 18th July. They then navigated\r\nthe coast to the eastward, in their canoes, exploring Coronation\r\nGulf. They attempted to return by Hood’s River, and across the land\r\nto Point Lake. After being exposed to the most dreadful sufferings,\r\nthey regained their winter-stations, at Fort Enterprise, and returned\r\nto England.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the perils and hardships which had already befallen\r\nthem, captain Franklin and his companions, Dr. Richardson and\r\nlieutenant Back, undertook a second expedition over the same country,\r\nand left Liverpool 16th February, 1825, arriving at Fort Chepewyan as\r\nearly as 15th July. They then descended Mackenzie River to the sea.\r\nDividing themselves into two parties, they explored the coast east\r\nand west, and the expedition returned home 24th September, 1827.\r\n\r\nOther voyages are those of Ross, of Back, first and second, and of\r\nDease and Simpson, two officers of the Hudson’s Bay Company, who\r\nsurveyed, in 1839, the remainder of the western coast which had been\r\nleft by Franklin. Dr. John Rae was dispatched by the Hudson’s Bay\r\nCompany in July, 1846, to survey the unexplored portion of the Arctic\r\ncoast at the north-eastern angle of the American continent, and\r\nreturned successfully in October, 1847.\r\n\r\nAn important expedition for discovery in the North Polar regions,\r\nthe termination of which is yet awaited with serious anxiety, left\r\nEngland under sir John Franklin in July, 1845. The ships were\r\nvictualled for only three full years, which expired during the summer\r\nof this year. Three expeditions have been sent in search of the lost\r\ntravellers. One departed early in February, 1848, for Behring’s\r\nStrait; a second, which sailed in the spring, under sir J. Ross, has\r\nbeen heard of as having reached Disco Island on the 2nd July; and a\r\nthird, under sir John Richardson, accompanied by Dr. Rae, left in\r\nMarch to proceed overland, and arrived at Lake Superior on 29th of\r\nApril. A report has very recently come in from the Esquimaux of their\r\nhaving seen “two large boats, full of white men, to the east of the\r\nMackenzie river;” and sir J. Ross has been spoken with by a whaler on\r\nthe east side of Baffin’s Bay, in latitude 74° 20′; but no tidings to\r\nrelieve the public anxiety have been received to the close of 1848,\r\nconcerning the fate of sir J. Franklin and his companions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RELIGIOUS TRACT SOCIETY: INSTITUTED 1799\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Transcriber’s Note\r\n  Hyphenation has been retained as published in the original publication.\r\n  Pg 57 Changed Magdalena Bay to Magdalen Bay\r\n  Pg 76 Removed quote before: From this remarkable sea\r\n  Pg 156 Changed of La Cèpede, to Cepède\r\n  Pg 158 Changed according to Egède, to Egedé",
