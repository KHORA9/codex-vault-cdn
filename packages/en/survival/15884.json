HOLDEN, M.A., Sc.D. LL.D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earth, the Sea, the Sky, and their wonders--these are the themes\r\nof this volume. The volume is so small, and the theme so vast! Men\r\nhave lived on the earth for hundreds of thousands of years; and its\r\nwonders have increased, not diminished, with their experience.\r\n\r\nTo our barbarous ancestors of centuries ago, all was mystery--the\r\nthunder, the rainbow, the growing corn, the ocean, the stars.\r\nGradually and by slow steps they learned to house themselves in trees,\r\nin caves, in huts, in houses; to find a sure supply of food; to\r\nprovide a stock of serviceable clothing. The arts of life were born;\r\ntools were invented; the priceless boon of fire was received; tribes\r\nand clans united for defence; some measure of security and comfort was\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nWith security and comfort came leisure; and the mind of early Man\r\nbegan curiously to inquire the meaning of the mysteries with which he\r\nwas surrounded. That curious inquiry was the birth of Science. Art was\r\nborn when some far-away ancestor, in an idle hour, scratched on a\r\nbone the drawing of two of his reindeer fighting, or carved on the\r\nwalls of his cave the image of the mammoth that he had but lately\r\nslain with his spear and arrows.\r\n\r\nIn a mind that is completely ignorant there is no wonder. Wonder is\r\nthe child of knowledge--of partial and imperfect knowledge, to be\r\nsure, but still, of knowledge. The very first step in Science is to\r\nmake an inventory of external Nature (and by and by of the faculties\r\nof the mind that thinks). The second step is to catalogue similar\r\nappearances together. It is a much higher flight to seek the causes of\r\nlikenesses thus discovered.\r\n\r\nA few of the chapters of this volume are items in a mere catalogue of\r\nwonders, and deserve their place by accurate and eloquent description.\r\nMost of them, however, represent higher stages of insight. In the\r\nlatter, Nature is viewed not only with the eye of the observer, but\r\nalso with the mind's eye, curious to discover the reasons for things\r\nseen. The most penetrating inward inquiry accompanies the acutest\r\nexternal observation in such chapters as those of Darwin and Huxley,\r\nhere reprinted.\r\n\r\nNow, the point not to be overlooked is this: to Darwin and Huxley, as\r\nto their remote and uncultured ancestors, the World--the Earth, the\r\nSea, the Sky--is full of wonders and of mysteries, but the wonders are\r\nof a higher order. The problems of the thunder and of the rainbow as\r\nthey presented themselves to the men of a thousand generations ago,\r\nhave been fully solved: but the questions; what is the veritable\r\nnature of electricity, exactly how does it differ from light, are\r\nstill unanswered. And what are simple problems like these to the\r\nquestions: what is love; why do we feel a sympathy with this person,\r\nan antipathy for that; and others of the sort? Science has made almost\r\ninfinite advances since pre-historic man first felt the feeble current\r\nof intellectual curiosity amid his awe of the storm; it has still to\r\ngrow almost infinitely before anything like a complete explanation\r\neven of external Nature is achieved.\r\n\r\nSuppose that, at some future day, all physical and mechanical laws\r\nshould be found to be direct consequences of a single majestic law,\r\njust as all the motions of the planets are (but--are they?) the direct\r\nresults of the single law of gravitation. Gravitation will, probably,\r\nsoon be explained in terms of some remoter cause, but the reason of\r\nthat single and ultimate law of the universe which we have imagined\r\nwould still remain unknown. Human knowledge will always have limits,\r\nand beyond those limits there will always be room for mystery and\r\nwonder. A complete and exhaustive explanation of the world is\r\ninconceivable, so long as human powers and capacities remain at all as\r\nthey now are.\r\n\r\nIt is important to emphasize such truths, especially in a book\r\naddressed to the young. When a lad hears for the first time that an\r\nastronomer, by a simple pointing of his spectroscope, can determine\r\nwith what velocity a star is approaching the earth, or receding from\r\nit, or when he hears that the very shape of the revolving masses of\r\ncertain stars can be calculated from simple measures of the sort, he\r\nis apt to conclude that Science, which has made such astounding\r\nadvances since the days of Galileo and Newton, must eventually reach a\r\ncomplete explanation of the entire universe. The conclusion is not\r\nunnatural, but it is not correct. There are limits beyond which\r\nScience, in this sense, cannot go. Its scope is limited. Beyond its\r\nlimits there are problems that it cannot solve, mysteries that it\r\ncannot explain.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, for example, the nature of Force is unknown. A\r\nweight released from the hand drops to the earth. Exactly what is the\r\nnature of the force with which the earth attracts it? We do not know,\r\nbut it so happens that it is more than likely that an explanation will\r\nbe reached in our own day. Gravity will be explained in terms of some\r\nmore general forces. The mystery will be pushed back another step, and\r\nyet another and another. But the progress is not indefinite. If all\r\nthe mechanical actions of the entire universe were to be formulated as\r\nthe results of a single law or cause, the cause of that cause would be\r\nstill to seek, as has been said.\r\n\r\nWe have every right to exult in the amazing achievements of Science;\r\nbut we have not understood them until we realize that the universe of\r\nScience has strict limits, within which all its conquests must\r\nnecessarily be confined. Humility, and not pride, is the final lesson\r\nof scientific work and study.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe choice of the selections printed in this volume has been\r\nnecessarily limited by many hampering conditions, that of mere space\r\nbeing one of the most harassing. Each of the chapters might readily be\r\nexpanded into a volume. Volumes might be added on topics almost\r\nuntouched here. It has been necessary to pass over almost without\r\nnotice matters of surpassing interest and importance: Electricity and\r\nits wonderful and new applications; the new Biology, with its views\r\nupon such fundamental questions as the origins of life and death;\r\nmodern Astronomy, with its far-reaching pronouncements upon the fate\r\nof universes. All these can only be touched lightly, if at all. It is\r\nthe chief purpose of this volume to point the way towards the most\r\nmodern and the greatest conclusions of Science, and to lay foundations\r\nupon which the reading of a life-time can be laid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Signature: Edward S. Holden]\r\n\r\nUNITED STATES MILITARY ACADEMY, WEST POINT, _January 1, 1902_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWONDERS OF EARTH, SEA, AND SKY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE EARTH'S CRUST IS MADE OF\r\n\r\n(FROM THE WORLD'S FOUNDATIONS.)\r\n\r\nBY AGNES GIBERNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"Stand still and consider the wondrous works of God.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhat is the earth made of--this round earth upon which we human beings\r\nlive and move?\r\n\r\nA question more easily asked than answered, as regards a very large\r\nportion of it. For the earth is a huge ball nearly eight thousand\r\nmiles in diameter, and we who dwell on the outside have no means of\r\ngetting down more than a very little way below the surface. So it is\r\nquite impossible for us to speak positively as to the inside of the\r\nearth, and what it is made of. Some people believe the earth's inside\r\nto be hard and solid, while others believe it to be one enormous lake\r\nor furnace of fiery melted rock. But nobody really knows.\r\n\r\nThis outside crust has been reckoned to be of many different\r\nthicknesses. One man will say it is ten miles thick, and another will\r\nrate it at four hundred miles. So far as regards man's knowledge of\r\nit, gained from mining, from boring, from examination of rocks, and\r\nfrom reasoning out all that may be learned from these observations, we\r\nshall allow an ample margin if we count the field of geology to extend\r\nsome twenty miles downwards from the highest mountain-tops. Beyond\r\nthis we find ourselves in a land of darkness and conjecture.\r\n\r\nTwenty miles is only one four-hundredth part of the earth's\r\ndiameter--a mere thin shell over a massive globe. If the earth were\r\nbrought down in size to an ordinary large school globe, a piece of\r\nrough brown paper covering it might well represent the thickness of\r\nthis earth-crust, with which the science of geology has to do. And the\r\nwhole of the globe, this earth of ours, is but one tiny planet in the\r\ngreat Solar System. And the centre of that Solar System, the blazing\r\nsun, though equal in size to more than a million earths, is yet\r\nhimself but one star amid millions of twinkling stars, scattered\r\nbroadcast through the universe. So it would seem at first sight that\r\nthe field of geology is a small field compared with that of\r\nastronomy....\r\n\r\nWith regard to the great bulk of the globe little can be said. Very\r\nprobably it is formed through and through of the same materials as the\r\ncrust. This we do not know. Neither can we tell, even if it be so\r\nformed, whether the said materials are solid and cold like the\r\noutside crust, or whether they are liquid with heat. The belief has\r\nbeen long and widely held that the whole inside of the earth is one\r\nvast lake or furnace of melted fiery-hot material, with only a thin\r\ncooled crust covering it. Some in the present day are inclined to\r\nquestion this, and hold rather that the earth is solid and cold\r\nthroughout, though with large lakes of liquid fire here and there,\r\nunder or in her crust, from which our volcanoes are fed....\r\n\r\nThe materials of which the crust is made are many and various; yet,\r\ngenerally speaking, they may all be classed under one simple word, and\r\nthat word is--_Rock_.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that, when we talk of rock in this geological\r\nsense, we do not only mean hard and solid stone, as in common\r\nconversation. Rock may be changed by heat into a liquid or \"molten\"\r\nstate, as ice is changed by heat to water. Liquid rock may be changed\r\nby yet greater heat to vapor, as water is changed to steam, only we\r\nhave in a common way no such heat at command as would be needed to\r\neffect this. Rock may be hard or soft. Rock maybe chalky, clayey, or\r\nsandy. Rock may be so close-grained that strong force is needed to\r\nbreak it; or it may be so porous--so full of tiny holes--that water\r\nwill drain through it; or it may be crushed and crumbled into loose\r\ngrains, among which you can pass your fingers.\r\n\r\nThe cliffs above our beaches are rock; the sand upon our seashore is\r\nrock; the clay used in brick-making is rock; the limestone of the\r\nquarry is rock; the marble of which our mantel-pieces are made is\r\nrock. The soft sandstone of South Devon, and the hard granite of the\r\nnorth of Scotland, are alike rock. The pebbles in the road are rock;\r\nthe very mould in our gardens is largely composed of crumbled rock. So\r\nthe word in its geological sense is a word of wide meaning.\r\n\r\nNow the business of the geologist is to read the history of the past\r\nin these rocks of which the earth's crust is made. This may seem a\r\nsingular thing to do, and I can assure you it is not an easy task.\r\n\r\nFor, to begin with, the history itself is written in a strange\r\nlanguage, a language which man is only just beginning to spell out and\r\nunderstand. And this is only half the difficulty with which we have to\r\nstruggle.\r\n\r\nIf a large and learned book were put before you and you were set to\r\nread it through, you would perhaps, have no insurmountable difficulty,\r\nwith patience and perseverance, in mastering its meaning.\r\n\r\nBut how if the book were first chopped up into pieces, if part of it\r\nwere flung away out of reach, if part of it were crushed into a pulp,\r\nif the numbering of the pages were in many places lost, if the whole\r\nwere mixed up in confusion, and if _then_ you were desired to sort,\r\nand arrange, and study the volume?\r\n\r\nPicture to yourself what sort of a task this would be, and you will\r\nhave some idea of the labors of the patient geologist.\r\n\r\nRocks may be divided into several kinds or classes. For the present\r\nmoment it will be enough to consider the two grand\r\ndivisions--_Stratified rocks_ and _Unstratified rocks_.\r\n\r\nUnstratified rocks are those which were once, at a time more or less\r\ndistant, in a melted state from intense heat, and which have since\r\ncooled into a half _crystallized_ state; much the same as water, when\r\ngrowing colder, cools and crystallizes into ice. Strictly speaking, ice\r\nis rock, just as much as granite and sandstone are rock. Water itself\r\nis of the nature of rock, only as we commonly know it in the liquid\r\nstate we do not commonly call it so.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNSTRATIFIED ROCK.--A VOLCANIC BLOCK.]\r\n\r\n\"Crystallization\" means those particular forms or shapes in which the\r\nparticles of a liquid arrange themselves, as that liquid hardens into\r\na solid--in other words, as it freezes. Granite, iron, marble, are\r\nfrozen substances, just as truly as ice is a frozen substance; for\r\nwith greater heat they would all become liquid like water. When a\r\nliquid freezes, there are always crystals formed, though these are not\r\nalways visible without the help of a microscope. Also the crystals are\r\nof different shapes with different substances.\r\n\r\nIf you examine the surface of a puddle or pond, when a thin covering\r\nof ice is beginning to form, you will be able to see plainly the\r\ndelicate sharp needle-like forms of the ice crystals. Break a piece of\r\nice, and you will find that it will not easily break just in any way\r\nthat you may choose, but it will only split along the lines of these\r\nneedle-like crystals. This particular mode of splitting in a\r\ncrystallized rock is called the _cleavage_ of that rock.\r\n\r\nCrystallization may take place either slowly or rapidly, and either\r\nin the open air or far below ground. The lava from a volcano is an\r\nexample of rock which has crystallized rapidly in the open air; and\r\ngranite is an example of rock which has crystallized slowly\r\nunderground beneath great pressure.\r\n\r\nStratified rocks, on the contrary, which make up a very large part of\r\nthe earth's crust, are not crystallized. Instead of having cooled from\r\na liquid into a solid state, they have been slowly _built up_, bit by\r\nbit and grain upon grain, into their present form, through long ages\r\nof the world's history. The materials of which they are made were\r\nprobably once, long, long ago, the crumblings from granite and other\r\ncrystallized rocks, but they show now no signs of crystallization.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF STRATIFIED ROCKS.\r\n\r\n_a._ Conglomerate. _b._ Pebbly Sandstone, _c._ Thin-bedded Sandstone,\r\n_d._ Shelly Sandstone, _e._ Shale. _f._ Limestone.]\r\n\r\nThey are called \"stratified\" because they are in themselves made up of\r\ndistinct layers, and also because they lie thus one upon another in\r\nlayers, or _strata_, just as the leaves of a book lie, or as the\r\nbricks of a house are placed.\r\n\r\nThroughout the greater part of Europe, of Asia, of Africa, of North\r\nand South America, of Australia, these rocks are to be found,\r\nstretching over hundreds of miles together, north, south, east, and\r\nwest, extending up to the tops of some of the earth's highest\r\nmountains, reaching down deep into the earth's crust. In many parts if\r\nyou could dig straight downwards through the earth for thousands of\r\nfeet, you would come to layer after layer of these stratified rocks,\r\none kind below another, some layers thick, some layers thin, here a\r\nstratum of gravel, there a stratum of sandstone, here a stratum of\r\ncoal, there a stratum of clay.\r\n\r\nBut how, when, where, did the building up of all these rock-layers\r\ntake place?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BEACH IN THE FOREGROUND IS A ROCKY SHELF, THE\r\nREMNANT OF THE CLIFF WHICH ONCE EXTENDED OUT TO THE ISLAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPeople are rather apt to think of land and water on the earth as if\r\nthey were fixed in one changeless form,--as if every continent and\r\nevery island were of exactly the same shape and size now that it\r\nalways has been and always will be.\r\n\r\nYet nothing can be further from the truth. The earth-crust is a scene\r\nof perpetual change, of perpetual struggle, of perpetual building up,\r\nof perpetual wearing away.\r\n\r\nThe work may go on slowly, but it does go on. The sea is always\r\nfighting against the land, beating down her cliffs, eating into her\r\nshores, swallowing bit by bit of solid earth; and rain and frost and\r\ninland streams are always busily at work, helping the ocean in her\r\nwork of destruction. Year by year and century by century it continues.\r\nNot a country in the world which is bordered by the open sea has\r\nprecisely the same coast-line that it had one hundred years ago; not a\r\nland in the world but parts each century with masses of its material,\r\nwashed piecemeal away into the ocean.\r\n\r\nIs this hard to believe? Look at the crumbling cliffs around old\r\nEngland's shores. See the effect upon the beach of one night's fierce\r\nstorm. Mark the pathway on the cliff, how it seems to have crept so\r\nnear the edge that here and there it is scarcely safe to tread; and\r\nvery soon, as we know, it will become impassable. Just from a mere\r\naccident, of course,--the breaking away of some of the earth, loosened\r\nby rain and frost and wind. But this is an accident which happens\r\ndaily in hundreds of places around the shores.\r\n\r\nLeaving the ocean, look now at this river in our neighborhood, and see\r\nthe slight muddiness which seems to color its waters. What from? Only\r\na little earth and sand carried off from the banks as it flowed,--very\r\nunimportant and small in quantity, doubtless, just at this moment and\r\njust at this spot. But what of that little going on week after week,\r\nand century after century, throughout the whole course of the river,\r\nand throughout the whole course of every river and rivulet in our\r\nwhole country and in every other country. A vast amount of material\r\nmust every year be thus torn from the land and given to the ocean. For\r\nthe land's loss here is the ocean's gain.\r\n\r\nAnd, strange to say, we shall find that this same ocean, so busily\r\nengaged with the help of its tributary rivers in pulling down land, is\r\nno less busily engaged with their help in building it up.\r\n\r\nYou have sometimes seen directions upon a vial of medicine to \"shake\"\r\nbefore taking the dose. When you have so shaken the bottle the clear\r\nliquid grows thick; and if you let it stand for awhile the thickness\r\ngoes off, and a fine grain-like or dust-like substance settles down at\r\nthe bottom--the settlement or _sediment_ of the medicine. The finer\r\nthis sediment, the slower it is in settling. If you were to keep the\r\nliquid in gentle motion, the fine sediment would not settle down at\r\nthe bottom. With coarser and heavier grains the motion would have to\r\nbe quicker to keep them supported in the water.\r\n\r\nNow it is just the same thing with our rivers and streams. Running\r\nwater can support and carry along sand and earth, which in still water\r\nwould quickly sink to the bottom; and the more rapid the movement of\r\nthe water, the greater is the weight it is able to bear.\r\n\r\nThis is plainly to be seen in the case of a mountain torrent. As it\r\nfoams fiercely through its rocky bed it bears along, not only mud and\r\nsand and gravel, but stones and even small rocks, grinding the latter\r\nroughly together till they are gradually worn away, first to rounded\r\npebbles, then to sand, and finally to mud. The material thus swept\r\naway by a stream, ground fine, and carried out to sea--part being\r\ndropped by the way on the river-bed--is called _detritus_, which\r\nsimply means _worn-out_ material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MOUNTAIN TORRENT.]\r\n\r\nThe tremendous carrying-power of a mountain torrent can scarcely be\r\nrealized by those who have not observed it for themselves. I have seen\r\na little mountain-stream swell in the course of a heavy thunderstorm\r\nto such a torrent, brown and turbid with earth torn from the\r\nmountainside, and sweeping resistlessly along in its career a shower\r\nof stones and rock-fragments. That which happens thus occasionally\r\nwith many streams is more or less the work all the year round of many\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nAs the torrent grows less rapid, lower down in its course, it ceases\r\nto carry rocks and stones, though the grinding and wearing away of\r\nstones upon the rocky bed continues, and coarse gravel is borne still\r\nupon its waters. Presently the widening stream, flowing yet more\r\ncalmly, drops upon its bed all such coarser gravel as is not worn away\r\nto fine earth, but still bears on the lighter grains of sand. Next the\r\nslackening speed makes even the sand too heavy a weight, and that in\r\nturn falls to line the river-bed, while the now broad and placid\r\nstream carries only the finer particles of mud suspended in its\r\nwaters. Soon it reaches the ocean, and the flow being there checked by\r\nthe incoming ocean-tide, even the mud can no longer be held up, and it\r\nalso sinks slowly in the shallows near the shore, forming sometimes\r\nbroad mud-banks dangerous to the mariner.\r\n\r\nThis is the case only with smaller rivers. Where the stream is\r\nstronger, the mud-banks are often formed much farther out at sea; and\r\nmore often still the river-detritus is carried away and shed over the\r\nocean-bed, beyond the reach of our ken. The powerful rush of water in\r\nearth's greater streams bears enormous masses of sand and mud each\r\nyear far out into the ocean, there dropping quietly the gravel, sand,\r\nand earth, layer upon layer at the bottom of the sea. Thus pulling\r\ndown and building up go on ever side by side; and while land is the\r\ntheatre oftentimes of decay and loss, ocean is the theatre oftentimes\r\nof renewal and gain.\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you notice the word \"sediment\" used a few pages back about the\r\nsettlement at the bottom of a medicine-vial?\r\n\r\nThere is a second name given to the Stratified Rocks, of which the\r\nearth's crust is so largely made up. They are called also _Sedimentary\r\nRocks_.\r\n\r\nThe reason is simply this. The Stratified Rocks of the present day\r\nwere once upon a time made up out of the sediment stolen first from\r\nland and then allowed to settle down on the sea-bottom.\r\n\r\nLong, long ago, the rivers, the streams, the ocean, were at work, as\r\nthey are now, carrying away rock and gravel, sand and earth. Then, as\r\nnow, all this material, borne upon the rivers, washed to and fro by\r\nthe ocean, settled down at the mouths of rivers or at the bottom of\r\nthe sea, into a sediment, one layer forming over another, gradually\r\nbuilt up through long ages. At first it was only a soft, loose, sandy\r\nor muddy sediment, such as you may see on the seashore, or in a\r\nmud-bank. But as the thickness of the sediment increased, the weight\r\nof the layers above gradually pressed the lower layers into firm hard\r\nrocks; and still, as the work of building went on, these layers were,\r\nin their turn, made solid by the increasing weight over them. Certain\r\nchemical changes had also a share in the transformation from soft mud\r\nto hard rock, which need not be here considered.\r\n\r\nAll this has through thousands of years been going on. The land is\r\nperpetually crumbling away; and fresh land under the sea is being\r\nperpetually built up, from the very same materials which the sea and\r\nthe rivers have so mercilessly stolen from continents and islands.\r\nThis is the way, if geologists rightly judge, in which a very large\r\npart of the enormous formations of Stratified or Sedimentary Rocks\r\nhave been made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW IN A CANON.]\r\n\r\nSo far is clear. But now we come to a difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe Stratified Rocks, of which a very large part of the continents is\r\nmade, appear to have been built up slowly, layer upon layer, out of\r\nthe gravel, sand, and mud, washed away from the land and dropped on\r\nthe shore of the ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEA CLIFFS SHOWING A SERIES OF STRATIFIED ROCKS.]\r\n\r\nYou may see these layers for yourself as you walk out into the\r\ncountry. Look at the first piece of bluff rock you come near, and\r\nobserve the clear pencil-like markings of layer above layer--not often\r\nindeed lying _flat_, one over another, and this must be explained\r\nlater, but however irregularly slanting, still plainly visible. You\r\ncan examine these lines of stratification on the nearest cliff, the\r\nnearest quarry, the nearest bare headland, in your neighborhood.\r\n\r\nBut how can this be? If all these stratified rocks are built on the\r\nfloor of the ocean out of material taken _from_ the land, how can we\r\nby any possibility find such rocks _upon_ the land? In the beds of\r\nrivers we might indeed expect to see them, but surely nowhere else\r\nsave under ocean waters.\r\n\r\nYet find them we do. Through England, through the two great\r\nworld-continents, they abound on every side. Thousands of miles in\r\nunbroken succession are composed of such rocks.\r\n\r\nStand with me near the seashore, and let us look around. Those white\r\nchalk cliffs--they, at least, are not formed of sand or earth. True,\r\nand the lines of stratification are in them very indistinct, if seen\r\nat all; yet they too are built up of sediment of a different kind,\r\ndropping upon ocean's floor. See, however, in the rough sides of\r\nyonder bluff the markings spoken of, fine lines running alongside of\r\none another, sometimes flat, sometimes bent or slanting, but always\r\ngiving the impression of layer piled upon layer. Yet how can one for a\r\nmoment suppose that the ocean-waters ever rose so high?\r\n\r\nStay a moment. Look again at yonder white chalk cliff, and observe a\r\nlittle way below the top a singular band of shingles, squeezed into\r\nthe cliff, as it were, with chalk below and earth above.\r\n\r\nThat is believed to be an old sea-beach. Once upon a time the waters\r\nof the sea are supposed to have washed those shingles, as now they\r\nwash the shore near which we stand, and all the white cliff must have\r\nlain then beneath the ocean.\r\n\r\nGeologists were for a long while sorely puzzled to account for these\r\nold sea-beaches, found high up in the cliffs around our land in many\r\ndifferent places.\r\n\r\nThey had at first a theory that the sea must once, in far back ages,\r\nhave been a great deal higher than it is now. But this explanation\r\nonly brought about fresh difficulties. It is quite impossible that the\r\nlevel of the sea should be higher in one part of the world than in\r\nanother. If the sea around England were then one or two hundred feet\r\nhigher than it is now, it must have been one or two hundred feet\r\nhigher in every part of the world where the ocean-waters have free\r\nflow. One is rather puzzled to know where all the water could have\r\ncome from, for such a tremendous additional amount. Besides, in some\r\nplaces remains of sea-animals are found in mountain heights, as much\r\nas two or three thousand feet above the sea-level--as, for instance,\r\nin Corsica. This very much increases the difficulty of the above\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nSo another theory was started instead, and this is now generally\r\nsupposed to be the true one. What if instead of the whole ocean having\r\nbeen higher, parts of the land were lower? England at one time, parts\r\nof Europe at another time, parts of Asia and America at other times,\r\nmay have slowly sunk beneath the ocean, and after long remaining there\r\nhave slowly risen again.\r\n\r\nThis is by no means so wild a supposition as it may seem when first\r\nheard, and as it doubtless did seem when first proposed. For even in\r\nthe present day these movements of the solid crust of our earth are\r\ngoing on. The coasts of Sweden and Finland have long been slowly and\r\nsteadily rising out of the sea, so that the waves can no longer reach\r\nso high upon those shores as in years gone by they used to reach. In\r\nGreenland, on the contrary, land has long been slowly and steadily\r\nsinking, so that what used to be the shore now lies under the sea.\r\nOther such risings and sinkings might be mentioned, as also many more\r\nin connection with volcanoes and earthquakes, which are neither slow\r\nnor steady, but sudden and violent.\r\n\r\nSo it becomes no impossible matter to believe that, in the course of\r\nages past, all those wide reaches of our continents and islands, where\r\nsedimentary rocks are to be found, were each in turn, at one time or\r\nanother, during long periods, beneath the rolling waters of the\r\nocean....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese built-up rocks are not only called \"Stratified,\" and\r\n\"Sedimentary.\" They have also the name of _Aqueous Rock_, from the\r\nLatin word _aqua, water_; because they are believed to have been\r\nformed by the action of the water.\r\n\r\nThey have yet another and fourth title, which is, _Fossiliferous\r\nRocks_.\r\n\r\nFossils are the hardened remains of animals and vegetables found in\r\nrocks. They are rarely, if ever, seen in unstratified rocks; but many\r\nlayers of stratified rocks abound in these remains. Whole skeletons as\r\nwell as single bones, whole tree-trunks as well as single leaves, are\r\nfound thus embedded in rock-layers, where in ages past the animal or\r\nplant died and found a grave. They exist by thousands in many parts of\r\nthe world, varying in size from the huge skeleton of the elephant to\r\nthe tiny shell of the microscopic animalcule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOSSIL OF CARBONIFEROUS FERN.]\r\n\r\nFossils differ greatly in kind. Sometimes the entire shell or bone is\r\nchanged into stone, losing all its animal substance, but retaining its\r\nold outline and its natural markings. Sometimes the fossil is merely\r\nthe hardened impress of the outside of a shell or leaf, which has\r\ndented its picture on soft clay, and has itself disappeared, while the\r\nsoft clay has become rock, and the indented picture remains fixed\r\nthrough after-centuries. Sometimes the fossil is the cast of the\r\ninside of a shell; the said shell having been filled with soft mud,\r\nwhich has taken its exact shape and hardened, while the shell itself\r\nhas vanished. The most complete description of fossil is the first of\r\nthese three kinds. It is wonderfully shown sometimes in fossil wood,\r\nwhere all the tiny cells and delicate fibres remain distinctly marked\r\nas of old, only the whole woody substance has changed into hard stone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOOTPRINTS FROM TRIASSIC SANDSTONE OF CONNECTICUT.]\r\n\r\nBut although the fossil remains of quadrupeds and other land-animals\r\nare found in large quantities, their number is small compared with the\r\nenormous number of fossil sea-shells and sea-animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOSSIL FOOTPRINTS.]\r\n\r\nLand-animals can, as a rule, have been so preserved, only when they\r\nhave been drowned in ponds or rivers, or mired in bogs and swamps, or\r\novertaken by frost, or swept out to sea.\r\n\r\nSea-animals, on the contrary, have been so preserved on land whenever\r\nthat land has been under the sea; and this appears to have been the\r\ncase, at one or another past age, with the greater part of our\r\npresent continents. These fossil remains of sea-animals are\r\ndiscovered in all quarters of the world, not only on the seashore but\r\nalso far inland, not only deep down underground but also high up on\r\nthe tops of lofty mountains--a plain proof that over the summits of\r\nthose mountains the ocean must once have rolled, and this not for a\r\nbrief space only, but through long periods of time. And not on the\r\nmountain-summit only are these fossils known to abound, but sometimes\r\nin layer below layer of the mountain, from top to bottom, through\r\nthousands of feet of rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOSSIL SHELLS.]\r\n\r\nThis may well seem puzzling at first sight. Fossils of sea-creatures\r\non a mountain-top are startling enough; yet hardly so startling as the\r\nthought of fossils _inside_ that mountain. How could they have found\r\ntheir way thither?\r\n\r\nThe difficulty soon vanishes, if once we clearly understand that all\r\nthese thousands of feet of rock were built up slowly, layer after\r\nlayer, when portions of the land lay deep under the sea. Thus _each\r\nseparate layer_ of mud or sand or other material became in its turn\r\nthe _top layer_, and was for the time the floor of the ocean, until\r\nfurther droppings of material out of the waters made a fresh layer,\r\ncovering up the one below.\r\n\r\nWhile each layer was thus in succession the top layer of the building,\r\nand at the same time the floor of the ocean, animals lived and died\r\nin the ocean, and their remains sank to the bottom, resting upon the\r\nsediment floor. Thousands of such dead remains disappeared, crumbling\r\ninto fine dust and mingling with the waters, but here and there one\r\nwas caught captive by the half-liquid mud, and was quickly covered and\r\npreserved from decay. And still the building went on, and still layer\r\nafter layer was placed, till many fossils lay deep down beneath the\r\nlater-formed layers; and when at length, by slow or quick upheaval of\r\nthe ground, this sea-bottom became a mountain, the little fossils were\r\nburied within the body of that mountain. So wondrously the matter\r\nappears to have come about.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty with respect to the stratified rocks has to be\r\nthought of. All these layers or deposits of gravel, sand, or earth, on\r\nthe floor of the ocean, would naturally be horizontal--that is, would\r\nlie flat, one upon another. In places the ocean-floor might slant, or\r\na crevice or valley or ridge might break the smoothness of the\r\ndeposit. But though the layers might partake of the slant, though the\r\nvalley might have to be filled, though the ridge might have to be\r\nsurmounted, still the general tendency of the waves would be to level\r\nthe dropping deposits into flat layers.\r\n\r\nThen how is it that when we examine the strata of rocks in our\r\nneighborhood, wherever that neighborhood may be, we do not find them\r\nso arranged? Here, it is true, the lines for a space are nearly\r\nhorizontal, but there, a little way farther on, they are\r\nperpendicular; here they are bent, and there curved; here they are\r\nslanting, and there crushed and broken.\r\n\r\nThis only bears out what has been already said about the Book of\r\nGeology. It _has_ been bent and disturbed, crushed and broken.\r\n\r\nGreat powers have been at work in this crust of our earth. Continents\r\nhave been raised, mountains have been upheaved, vast masses of rock\r\nhave been scattered into fragments. Here or there we may find the\r\nlayers arranged as they were first laid down; but far more often we\r\ndiscover signs of later disturbance, either slow or sudden, varying\r\nfrom a mere quiet tilting to a violent overturn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXAMPLE OF DISTURBANCE OF THE EARTH'S LAYERS.]\r\n\r\nSo the Book of Geology is a torn and disorganized volume, not easy to\r\nread.\r\n\r\nYet, on the other hand, these very changes which have taken place are\r\na help to the geologist.\r\n\r\nIt may seem at first sight as if we should have an easier task, if the\r\nstrata were all left lying just as they were first formed, in smooth\r\nlevel layers, one above another. But if it were so, we could know very\r\nlittle about the lower layers.\r\n\r\nWe might indeed feel sure, as we do now, that the lowest layers were\r\nthe oldest and the top layers the newest, and that any fossils found\r\nin the lower layers must belong to an age farther back than any\r\nfossils found in the upper layers.\r\n\r\nSo much would be clear. And we might dig also and burrow a little way\r\ndown, through a few different kinds of rock, where they were not too\r\nthick. But that would be all. There our powers would cease.\r\n\r\nNow how different. Through the heavings and tiltings of the earth's\r\ncrust, the lower layers are often pushed quite up to the surface, so\r\nthat we are able to examine them and their fossils without the least\r\ndifficulty, and very often without digging underground at all.\r\n\r\nYou must not suppose that the real order of the rocks is changed by\r\nthese movements, for generally speaking it is not. The lower kinds are\r\nrarely if ever found placed _over_ the upper kinds; only the ends of\r\nthem are seen peeping out above ground.\r\n\r\nIt is as if you had a pile of copy-books lying flat one upon another,\r\nand were to put your finger under the lowest and push it up. All those\r\nabove would be pushed up also, and perhaps they would slip a little\r\nway down, so that you would have a row of _edges_ showing side by\r\nside, at very much the same height. The arrangement of the copy-books\r\nwould not be changed, for the lowest would still be the lowest in\r\nactual position; but a general tilting or upheaval would have taken\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nJust such a tilting or upheaval has taken place again and again with\r\nthe rocks forming our earth-crust. The edges of the lower rocks often\r\nshow side by side with those of higher layers.\r\n\r\nBut geologists know them apart. They are able to tell confidently\r\nwhether such and such a rock, peeping out at the earth's surface,\r\nbelongs really to a lower or a higher kind. For there is a certain\r\nsort of order followed in the arrangement of rock-layers all over the\r\nearth, and it is well known that some rocks are never found below some\r\nother rocks, that certain particular kinds are never placed above\r\ncertain other kinds. Thus it follows that the fossils found in one\r\ndescription of rock, must be the fossils of animals which lived and\r\ndied before the animals whose fossil remains are found in another\r\nneighboring rock, just because this last rock-layer was built upon the\r\nocean-floor above and therefore later than the other.\r\n\r\nAll this is part of the foreign language of geology--part of the\r\npiecing and arranging of the torn volume. Many mistakes are made; many\r\nblunders are possible; but the mistakes and blunders are being\r\ngradually corrected, and certain rules by which to read and understand\r\nare becoming more and more clear.\r\n\r\nIt has been already said that unstratified rocks are those which have\r\nbeen at some period, whether lately or very long ago, in a liquid\r\nstate from intense heat, and which have since cooled, either quickly\r\nor slowly, crystallizing as they cooled.\r\n\r\nUnstratified Rocks may be divided into two distinct classes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF A LAVA BOMB.]\r\n\r\nFirst.--Volcanic Rocks, such as lava. These have been quickly cooled\r\nat the surface of the earth, or not far below it.\r\n\r\nSecondly.--Plutonic Rocks, such as granite. These have been slowly\r\ncooled deep down in the earth under heavy pressure.\r\n\r\nThere is also a class of rocks, called metamorphic rocks, including\r\nsome kinds of marble. These are, strictly speaking, crystalline rocks,\r\nand yet they are arranged in something like layers. The word\r\n\"metamorphic\" simply means \"transformed.\" They are believed to have\r\nbeen once stratified rocks, perhaps containing often the remains of\r\nanimals; but intense heat has later transformed them into crystalline\r\nrocks, and the animal remains have almost or quite vanished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAVA-STREAM ON VESUVIUS.]\r\n\r\nJust as the different kinds of Stratified Rocks are often called\r\nAqueous Rocks, or rocks formed by the action of water--so these\r\ndifferent kinds of Unstratified Rocks are often called Igneous Rocks,\r\nor rocks formed by the action of fire--the name being taken from the\r\nLatin word for fire. The Metamorphic Rocks are sometimes described as\r\n\"Aqueo-igneous,\" since both water and fire helped in the forming of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was at one time believed, as a matter of certainty, that granite\r\nand such rocks belonged to a period much farther back than the periods\r\nof the stratified rocks. That is to say, it was supposed that\r\nfire-action had come first and water-action second; that the fire-made\r\nrocks were all formed in very early ages, and that only water-made\r\nrocks still continued to be formed. So the name of Primary Rocks, or\r\nFirst Rocks, was given to the granites and other such rocks, and the\r\nname of Secondary Rocks to all water-built rocks; while those of the\r\nthird class were called Transition Rocks, because they seemed to be a\r\nkind of link or stepping-stone in the change from the First to the\r\nSecond Rocks.\r\n\r\nThe chief reason for the general belief that fire-built rocks were\r\nolder than water-built ones was, that the former are as a rule found\r\nto lie _lower_ than the latter. They form, as it were, the basement of\r\nthe building, while the top-stories are made of water-built rocks.\r\n\r\nMany still believe that there is much truth in the thought. It is most\r\nprobable, so far as we are able to judge, that the _first-formed_\r\ncrust of rocks all over the earth was of cooled and crystallized\r\nmaterial. As these rocks were crumbled and wasted by the ocean,\r\nmaterials would have been supplied for the building-up of rocks, layer\r\nupon layer.\r\n\r\nBut this is conjecture. We cannot know with any certainty the course\r\nof events so far back in the past. And geologists are now able to\r\nstate with tolerable confidence that, however old many of the granites\r\nmay be, yet a large amount of the fire-built rocks are no older than\r\nthe water-built rocks which lie over them.\r\n\r\nSo by many geologists the names of Primary, Transition, and Secondary\r\nFormations are pretty well given up. It has been proposed to give\r\ninstead to the crystallized rocks of all kinds the name of Underlying\r\nRocks (Hypogene Rocks).\r\n\r\nBut if they really do lie under, how can they possibly be of the same\r\nage? One would scarcely venture to suppose, in looking at a building,\r\nthat the cellars had not been finished before the upper floors.\r\n\r\nTrue. In the first instance doubtless the cellars were first made,\r\nthen the ground-floor, then the upper stories.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, the house was so built, alterations and improvements\r\nmight be very widely carried on above and below. While one set of\r\nworkmen were engaged in remodelling the roof, another set of workmen\r\nmight be engaged in remodelling the kitchens and first floor, pulling\r\ndown, propping up, and actually rebuilding parts of the lower walls.\r\n\r\nThis is precisely what the two great fellow-workmen, Fire and Water,\r\nare ever doing in the crust of our earth. And if it be objected that\r\nsuch alterations too widely undertaken might result in slips, cracks,\r\nand slidings, of ceilings and walls in the upper stories, I can only\r\nsay that such catastrophes _have_ been the result of underground\r\nalterations in that great building, the earth's crust....\r\n\r\nWe see therefore clearly that, although the earliest fire-made rocks\r\nmay very likely date farther back than the earliest water-made rocks,\r\nyet the making of the two kinds has gone on side by side, one below\r\nand the other above ground, through all ages up to the present moment.\r\n\r\nAnd just as in the present day water continues its busy work above\r\nground of pulling down and building up, so also fire continues its\r\nbusy work underground of melting rocks which afterwards cool into new\r\nforms, and also of shattering and upheaving parts of the earth-crust.\r\n\r\nFor there can be no doubt that fiery heat does exist as a mighty power\r\nwithin our earth, though to what extent we are not able to say.\r\n\r\nThese two fellow-workers in nature have different modes of working.\r\nOne we can see on all sides, quietly progressing, demolishing land\r\npatiently bit by bit, building up land steadily grain by grain. The\r\nother, though more commonly hidden from sight, is fierce and\r\ntumultuous in character, and shows his power in occasional terrific\r\noutbursts.\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely realize what the power is of the imprisoned fiery\r\nforces underground, though even we are not without some witness of\r\ntheir existence. From time to time even our firm land has been felt to\r\ntremble with a thrill from some far-off shock; and even in our country\r\nis seen the marvel of scalding water pouring unceasingly from deep\r\nunderground....\r\n\r\nThink of the tremendous eruptions of Vesuvius, of Etna, of Hecla, of\r\nMauna Loa. Think of whole towns crushed and buried, with their\r\nthousands of living inhabitants. Think of rivers of glowing lava\r\nstreaming up from regions below ground, and pouring along the surface\r\nfor a distance of forty, fifty, and even sixty miles, as in Iceland\r\nand Hawaii. Think of red-hot cinders flung from a volcano-crater to a\r\nheight of ten thousand feet. Think of lakes of liquid fire in other\r\ncraters, five hundred to a thousand feet across, huge cauldrons of\r\nboiling rock. Think of showers of ashes from the furnace below of yet\r\nanother, borne so high aloft as to be carried seven hundred miles\r\nbefore they sank to earth again. Think of millions of red-hot stones\r\nflung out in one eruption of Vesuvius. Think of a mass of rock, one\r\nhundred cubic yards in size, hurled to a distance of eight miles or\r\nmore out of the crater of Cotopaxi.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOT WELLS.]\r\n\r\nThink also of earthquake-shocks felt through twelve hundred miles of\r\ncountry. Think of fierce tremblings and heavings lasting in constant\r\nsuccession through days and weeks of terror. Think of hundreds of\r\nmiles of land raised several feet in one great upheaval. Think of the\r\nearth opening in scores of wide-lipped cracks, to swallow men and\r\nbeasts. Think of hot mud, boiling water, scalding stream, liquid rock,\r\nbursting from such cracks, or pouring from rents in a mountain-side.\r\n\r\nTruly these are signs of a state of things in or below the solid crust\r\non which we live, that may make us doubt the absolute security of\r\n\"Mother Earth.\"\r\n\r\nDifferent explanations have been put forward to explain this seemingly\r\nfiery state of things underground.\r\n\r\nUntil lately the belief was widely held that our earth was one huge\r\nglobe of liquid fire, with only a slender cooled crust covering her, a\r\nfew miles in thickness.\r\n\r\nThis view was supported by the fact that heat is found to increase as\r\nmen descend into the earth. Measurements of such heat-increase have\r\nbeen taken, both in mines and in borings for wells. The usual rate is\r\nabout one degree more of heat, of our common thermometer, for every\r\nfifty or sixty feet of descent. If this were steadily continued, water\r\nwould boil at a depth of eight thousand feet below the surface; iron\r\nwould melt at a depth of twenty-eight miles; while at a depth of forty\r\nor fifty miles no known substance upon earth could remain solid.\r\n\r\nThe force of this proof is, however, weakened by the fact that the\r\nrate at which the heat increases differs very much in different\r\nplaces. Also it is now generally supposed that such a tremendous\r\nfurnace of heat--a furnace nearly eight thousand miles in\r\ndiameter--could not fail to break up and melt so slight a covering\r\nshell.\r\n\r\nMany believe, therefore, not that the whole interior of the earth is\r\nliquid with heat, but that enormous fire-seas or lakes of melted rock\r\nexist here and there, under or in the earth-crust. From these lakes\r\nthe volcanoes would be fed, and they would be the cause of earthquakes\r\nand land-upheavals or land-sinkings. There are strong reasons for\r\nsupposing that the earth was once a fiery liquid body, and that she\r\nhas slowly cooled through long ages. Some hold that her centre\r\nprobably grew solid first from tremendous pressure; that her crust\r\nafterwards became gradually cold; and that between the solid crust and\r\nthe solid inside or \"nucleus,\" a sea of melted rock long existed, the\r\nremains of which are still to be found in these tremendous fiery\r\nreservoirs.\r\n\r\nThe idea accords well with the fact that large numbers of extinct or\r\ndead volcanoes are scattered through many parts of the earth. If the\r\nabove explanation be the right one, doubtless the fire-seas in the\r\ncrust extended once upon a time beneath such volcanoes, but have since\r\ndied out or smouldered low in those parts.\r\n\r\nA somewhat curious calculation has been made, to illustrate the\r\ndifferent modes of working of these two mighty powers--Fire and Water.\r\n\r\nThe amount of land swept away each year in mud, and borne to the ocean\r\nby the River Ganges, was roughly reckoned, and also the amount of land\r\nbelieved to have been upheaved several feet in the great Chilian\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nIt was found that the river, steadily working month by month, would\r\nrequire some four hundred years to carry to the sea the same weight of\r\nmaterial, which in one tremendous effort was upheaved by the fiery\r\nunderground forces.\r\n\r\nYet we must not carry this distinction too far. Fire does not always\r\nwork suddenly, or water slowly; witness the slow rising and sinking of\r\nland in parts of the earth, continuing through centuries; and witness\r\nalso the effects of great floods and storms.\r\n\r\nThe crust of the earth is made of rock. But what is rock made of?\r\n\r\nCertain leading divisions of rocks have been already considered:\r\n\r\nThe Water-made Rocks;\r\n\r\nThe Fire-made Rocks, both Plutonic and Volcanic;\r\n\r\nThe Water-and-Fire-made Rocks.\r\n\r\nThe first of these--Water-made Rocks--may be subdivided into three\r\nclasses. These are,--\r\n\r\nI. _Flint Rocks_; II. _Clay Rocks_; III. _Lime Rocks_.\r\n\r\nThis is not a book in which it would be wise to go closely into the\r\nmineral nature of rocks. Two or three leading thoughts may, however,\r\nbe given.\r\n\r\nDoes it not seem strange that the hard and solid rocks should be in\r\ngreat measure formed of the same substances which form the thin\r\ninvisible air floating around us?\r\n\r\nYet so it is. There is a certain gas called Oxygen Gas. Without that\r\ngas you could not live many minutes. Banish it from the room in which\r\nyou are sitting, and in a few minutes you will die.\r\n\r\nThis gas makes up nearly one-quarter by weight of the atmosphere round\r\nthe whole earth.\r\n\r\nThe same gas plays an important part in the ocean; for more than\r\nthree-quarters of water is _oxygen_.\r\n\r\nIt plays also an important part in rocks; for about half the material\r\nof the entire earth's crust is oxygen.\r\n\r\nAnother chief material in rocks is _silicon_. This makes up\r\none-quarter of the crust, leaving only one-quarter to be accounted\r\nfor. Silicon mixed with oxygen makes silica or quartz. There are few\r\nrocks which have not a large amount of quartz in them. Common flint,\r\nsandstones, and the sand of our shores, are made of quartz, and\r\ntherefore belong to the first class of Silicious or Flint Rocks.\r\nGranites and lavas are about one-half quartz. The beautiful stones,\r\namethyst, agate, chalcedony, and jasper, are all different kinds of\r\nquartz.\r\n\r\nAnother chief material in rocks is a white metal called _aluminium_.\r\nUnited to oxygen it becomes alumina, the chief substance in clay.\r\nRocks of this kind--such as clays, and also the lovely blue gem,\r\nsapphire--are called Argillaceous Rocks, from the Latin word for clay,\r\nand belong to the second class. Such rocks keep fossils well.\r\n\r\nAnother is _calcium_. United to oxygen and carbonic acid, it makes\r\ncarbonate of lime, the chief substance in limestone; so all limestones\r\nbelong to the third class of Calcareous or Lime Rocks.\r\n\r\nOther important materials may be mentioned, such as _magnesium,\r\npotassium, sodium, iron, carbon, sulphur, hydrogen, chlorine,\r\nnitrogen_. These, with many more, not so common, make up the remaining\r\nquarter of the earth-crust.\r\n\r\nCarbon plays as important a part in animal and vegetable life as\r\nsilicon in rocks. Carbon is most commonly seen in three distinct\r\nforms--as charcoal, as black-lead, and as the pure brilliant diamond.\r\nCarbon united, in a particular proportion, to oxygen, forms carbonic\r\nacid; and carbonic acid united, in a particular proportion, to lime,\r\nforms limestone.\r\n\r\n_Hydrogen_ united to oxygen forms water. Each of these two gases is\r\ninvisible alone, but when they meet and mingle they form a liquid.\r\n\r\n_Nitrogen_ united to oxygen and to a small quantity of carbonic acid\r\ngas forms our atmosphere.\r\n\r\nRocks of pure flint, pure clay, or pure lime, are rarely or never met\r\nwith. Most rocks are made up of several different substances melted\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the fire-built rocks no remains of animals are found, though in\r\nwater-built rocks they abound. Water-built rocks are sometimes divided\r\ninto two classes--those which only contain occasional animal remains,\r\nand those which are more or less built up of the skeletons of animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMIBA PRINCEPS, ONE OF THE MANY ORDERS OF THE RHIZOPODA\r\nCLASS, MAGNIFIED ONE HUNDRED TIMES.]\r\n\r\nThere are some exceedingly tiny creatures inhabiting the ocean, called\r\nRhizopods. They live in minute shells, the largest of which may be\r\nalmost the size of a grain of wheat, but by far the greater number are\r\ninvisible as shells without a microscope, and merely show as fine\r\ndust. The rhizopods are of different shapes, sometimes round,\r\nsometimes spiral, sometimes having only one cell, sometimes having\r\nseveral cells. In the latter case a separate animal lives in each\r\ncell. The animal is of the very simplest as well as the smallest kind.\r\nHe has not even a mouth or a stomach but can take in food at any part\r\nof his body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RHIZOPODS (MAGNIFIED).]\r\n\r\nThese rhizopods live in the oceans in enormous numbers. Tens of\r\nmillions are ever coming into existence, living out their tiny lives,\r\ndying, and sinking to the bottom.\r\n\r\nThere upon the ocean-floor gather their remains, a heaped-up multitude\r\nof minute skeletons or shells, layer forming over layer.\r\n\r\nIt was long suspected that the white chalk cliffs of England were\r\nbuilt up in some such manner as this through past ages. And now at\r\nlength proof has been found, in the shape of mud dredged up from the\r\nocean-bottom--mud entirely composed of countless multitudes of these\r\nlittle shells, dropping there by myriads, and becoming slowly joined\r\ntogether in one mass.\r\n\r\nJust so, it is believed, were the white chalk cliffs built--gradually\r\nprepared on the ocean-floor, and then slowly or suddenly upheaved, so\r\nas to become a part of the dry land.\r\n\r\nThink what the enormous numbers must have been of tiny living\r\ncreatures, out of whose shells the wide reaches of white chalk cliffs\r\nhave been made. Chalk cliffs and chalk layers extend from Ireland,\r\nthrough England and France, as far as to the Crimea. In the south of\r\nRussia they are said to be six hundred feet thick. Yet one cubic inch\r\nof chalk is calculated to hold the remains of more than one million\r\nrhizopods. How many countless millions upon millions must have gone to\r\nthe whole structure! How long must the work of building up have\r\nlasted!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE POLYPS OF CORAL.]\r\n\r\nThese little shells do not always drop softly and evenly to the\r\nocean-floor, to become quietly part of a mass of shells. Sometimes,\r\nwhere the ocean is shallow enough for the waves to have power below,\r\nor where land currents can reach, they are washed about, and thrown\r\none against another, and ground into fine powder; and the fine powder\r\nbecomes in time, through different causes, solid rock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORAL POLYP.]\r\n\r\nLimestone is made in another way also. In the warm waters of the South\r\nPacific Ocean there are many islands, large and small, which have\r\nbeen formed in a wonderful manner by tiny living workers. The workers\r\nare soft jelly-like creatures, called polyps, who labor together in\r\nbuilding up great walls and masses of coral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORAL ISLAND.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG CORAL POLYP ATTACHED TO A ROCK AND EXPANDED.]\r\n\r\nThey never carry on their work above the surface of the water, for in\r\nthe air they would die. But the waves break the coral, and heap it up\r\nabove high-water mark, and carry earth and seeds to drop there till at\r\nlength a small low-lying island is formed.\r\n\r\nThe waves not only heap up broken coral, but they grind the coral into\r\nfine powder, and from this powder limestone rock is made, just as it\r\nis from the powdered shells of rhizopods. The material used by the\r\npolyps in building the coral is chiefly lime, which they have the\r\npower of gathering out of the water, and the fine coral-powder,\r\nsinking to the bottom, makes large quantities of hard limestone. Soft\r\nchalk is rarely, if ever, found near the coral islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. WHITE CORAL. 2. PORTION OF A BRANCH (MAGNIFIED).]\r\n\r\nLimestones are formed in the same manner from the grinding up of other\r\nsea-shells and fossils, various in kind; the powder becoming gradually\r\nunited into solid rock.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another way in which limestone is made, quite different\r\nfrom all these. Sometimes streams of water have a large quantity of\r\nlime in them; and these as they flow will drop layers of lime which\r\nharden into rock. Or a lime-laden spring, making its way through the\r\nroof of an underground cavern, will leave all kinds of fantastic\r\narrangements of limestone wherever its waters can trickle and drip.\r\nSuch a cavern is called a \"stalactite cave.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo there are different kinds of fossil rock-making. There may be rocks\r\nmade of other materials, with fossil simply buried in them. There may\r\nbe rocks made entirely of fossils, which have gathered in masses as\r\nthey sank to the sea-bottom, and have there become simply and lightly\r\njoined together. There may be rocks made of the ground-up powder of\r\nfossils, pressed into a solid substance or united by some other\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nRocks are also often formed of whole fossils, or stones, or shells,\r\nbound into one by some natural soft sticky cement, which has gathered\r\nround them and afterwards grown hard, like the cement which holds\r\ntogether the stones in a wall.\r\n\r\nThe tiny rhizopods (meaning root foot) which have so large a share in\r\nchalk and limestone making, are among the smallest and simplest known\r\nkinds of animal life.\r\n\r\nThere are also some very minute forms of vegetable life, which exist\r\nin equally vast numbers, called Diatoms. For a long while they were\r\nbelieved to be living animals, like the rhizopods. Scientific men are\r\nnow, however, pretty well agreed that they really are only vegetables\r\nor plants.\r\n\r\nThe diatoms have each one a tiny shell or shield, not made of lime\r\nlike the rhizopod-shells, but of flint. Some think that common flint\r\nmay be formed of these tiny shells.\r\n\r\nAgain, there is a kind of rock called Mountain Meal, which is entirely\r\nmade up of the remains of diatoms. Examined under the microscope,\r\nthousands of minute flint shields of various shapes are seen. This\r\nrock, or earth, is very abundant in many places, and is sometimes used\r\nas a polishing powder. In Bohemia there is a layer of it no less than\r\nfourteen feet thick. Yet so minute are the shells of which it is\r\ncomposed, that one square inch of rock is said to contain about four\r\nthousand millions of them. Each one of these millions is a separate\r\ndistinct fossil....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SUCCESSION OF BURIED COAL-GROWTHS AND ERECT\r\nTREE-STUMPS. SYDNEY, CAPE BRETON.\r\n\r\n_a._ Sandstone, _b._ Shales, _c._ Coal-seams, _d._ Bed containing\r\nRoots and Stumps _in situ_.]\r\n\r\nIf you examine carefully a piece of coal, you will find, more or less\r\nclearly, markings like those which are seen in a piece of wood.\r\nSometimes they are very distinct indeed. Coal abounds in impressions\r\nof leaves, ferns, and stems, and fossil remains of plants and\r\ntree-trunks are found in numbers in coal-seams.\r\n\r\nCoal is a vegetable substance. The wide coal-fields of Britain and\r\nother lands are the _fossil_ remains of vast forests.\r\n\r\nLong ages ago, as it seems, broad and luxuriant forests flourished\r\nover the earth. In many parts generation after generation of trees\r\nlived and died and decayed, leaving no trace of their existence,\r\nbeyond a little layer of black mould, soon to be carried away by wind\r\nand water. Coal could only be formed where there were bogs and\r\nquagmires.\r\n\r\nBut in bogs and quagmires, and in shallow lakes of low-lying lands,\r\nthere were great gatherings of slowly-decaying vegetable remains,\r\ntrees, plants, and ferns all mingling together. Then after a while the\r\nlow lands would sink and the ocean pouring in would cover them with\r\nlayers of protecting sand or mud; and sometimes the land would rise\r\nagain, and fresh forests would spring into life, only to be in their\r\nturn overwhelmed anew, and covered by fresh sandy or earthy deposits.\r\n\r\nThese buried forests lay through the ages following, slowly hardening\r\ninto the black and shining coal, so useful now to man.\r\n\r\nThe coal is found thus in thin or thick seams, with other rock-layers\r\nbetween, telling each its history of centuries long past. In one place\r\nno less than sixteen such beds of coal are found, one below another,\r\neach divided from the next above and the next underneath by beds of\r\nclay or sand or shale. The forests could not have grown in the sea,\r\nand the earth-layers could not have been formed on land, therefore\r\nmany land-risings and sinkings must have taken place. Each bed\r\nprobably tells the tale of a succession of forests....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore going on to a sketch of the early ages of the Earth's\r\nhistory--ages stretching back long long before the time of Adam--it is\r\nneedful to think yet for a little longer about the manner in which\r\nthat history is written, and the way in which it has to be read.\r\n\r\nFor the record is one difficult to make out, and its style of\r\nexpression is often dark and mysterious. There is scarcely any other\r\nvolume in the great Book of Nature, which the student is so likely to\r\nmisread as this one. It is very needful, therefore, to hold the\r\nconclusions of geologists with a light grasp, guarding each with a\r\n\"perhaps\" or a \"may be.\" Many an imposing edifice has been built, in\r\ngeology, upon a rickety foundation which has speedily given way.\r\n\r\nIn all ages of the world's history up to the present day, rock-making\r\nhas taken place--fire-made rocks being fashioned underground, and\r\nwater-made rocks being fashioned above ground though under water.\r\n\r\nAlso in all ages different kinds of rocks have been fashioned side by\r\nside--limestone in one part of the world, sandstone in another, chalk\r\nin another, clay in another, and so on. There have, it is true, been\r\nages when one kind seems to have been the _chief_ kind--an age of\r\nlimestone, or an age of chalk. But even then there were doubtless more\r\nrock-buildings going on, though not to so great an extent. On the\r\nother hand, there may have been ages during which no limestone was\r\nmade, or no chalk, or no clay. As a general rule, however, the various\r\nsorts of rock-building have probably gone on together. This was not so\r\nwell understood by early geologists as it is now.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty is often great of disentangling the different strata,\r\nand saying which was earlier and which later formed.\r\n\r\nStill, by close and careful study of the rocks which compose the\r\nearth's crust, a certain kind of order is found to exist, more or less\r\nfollowed out in all parts of the world. _When_ each layer was formed\r\nin England or in America, the geologist cannot possibly say. He can,\r\nhowever, assert, in either place, that a certain mass of rock was\r\nformed before a certain other mass in that same place, even though\r\nthe two may seem to lie side by side; for he knows that they were so\r\nplaced only by upheaval, and that once upon a time the one lay beneath\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe geologist can go further. He can often declare that a certain mass\r\nof rock in America and a certain mass of rock in England, quite\r\ndifferent in kind, were probably built up at about the same time. How\r\nlong ago that time was he would be rash to attempt to say; but that\r\nthe two belong to the same age he has good reason for supposing.\r\n\r\nWe find rocks piled upon rocks in a certain order, so that we may\r\ngenerally be pretty confident that the lower rocks were first made,\r\nand the upper rocks the latest built. Further than this, we find in\r\nall the said layers of water-built rocks signs of past life.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, much of this life was ocean-life, though not all.\r\n\r\nBelow the sea, as the rock-layers were being formed, bit by bit, of\r\nearth dropping from the ocean to the ocean's floor, sea-creatures\r\nlived out their lives and died by thousands, to sink to that same\r\nfloor. Millions passed away, dissolving and leaving no trace behind;\r\nbut thousands were preserved--shells often, animals sometimes.\r\n\r\nNor was this all. For now and again some part of the sea-bottom was\r\nupheaved, slowly or quickly, till it became dry land. On this dry land\r\nanimals lived again, and thousands of them, too, died, and their bones\r\ncrumbled into dust. But here and there one was caught in bog or frost,\r\nand his remains were preserved till, through lapse of ages, they\r\nturned to stone.\r\n\r\nYet again that land would sink, and over it fresh layers were formed\r\nby the ocean-waters, with fresh remains of sea-animals buried in with\r\nthe layers of sand or lime; and once more the sea-bottom would rise,\r\nperhaps then to continue as dry land, until the day when man should\r\ndiscover and handle these hidden remains.\r\n\r\nNow note a remarkable fact as to these fossils, scattered far and wide\r\nthrough the layers of stratified rock.\r\n\r\nIn the uppermost and latest built rocks the animals found are the\r\nsame, in great measure, as those which now exist upon the earth.\r\n\r\nLeaving the uppermost rocks, and examining those which lie a little\r\nway below, we find a difference. Some are still the same, and others,\r\nif not quite the same, are very much like what we have now; but here\r\nand there a creature of a different form appears.\r\n\r\nGo deeper still, and the kinds of animals change further. Fewer and\r\nfewer resemble those which now range the earth; more and more belong\r\nto other species.\r\n\r\nDescend through layer after layer till we come to rocks built in\r\nearliest ages and not one fossil shall we find precisely the same as\r\none animal living now.\r\n\r\nSo not only are the rocks built in successive order, stratum after\r\nstratum belonging to age after age in the past, but fossil-remains\r\nalso are found in successive order, kind after kind belonging to past\r\nage after age.\r\n\r\nAlthough in the first instance the succession of fossils was\r\nunderstood by means of the succession of rock-layers, yet in the\r\nsecond place the arrangement of rock-layers is made more clear by the\r\nmeans of these very fossils.\r\n\r\nA geologist, looking at the rocks in America, can say which there were\r\nfirst-formed, which second-formed, which third-formed. Also, looking\r\nat the rocks in England, he can say which there were first-formed,\r\nsecond-formed, third-formed. He would, however, find it very\r\ndifficult, if not impossible, to say which among any of the American\r\nrocks was formed at about the same time as any particular one among\r\nthe English rocks, were it not for the help afforded him by these\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\nJust as the regular succession of rock-strata has been gradually\r\nlearned, so the regular succession of different fossils is becoming\r\nmore and more understood. It is now known that some kinds of fossils\r\nare always found in the oldest rocks, and in them only; that some\r\nkinds are always found in the newest rocks, and in them only; that\r\nsome fossils are rarely or never found lower than certain layers; that\r\nsome fossils are rarely or never found higher than certain other\r\nlayers.\r\n\r\nSo this fossil arrangement is growing into quite a history of the\r\npast. And a geologist, looking at certain rocks, pushed up from\r\nunderground, in England and in America, can say: \"These are very\r\ndifferent kinds of rocks, it is true, and it would be impossible to\r\nsay how long the building up of the one might have taken place before\r\nor after the other. But I see that in both these rocks there are\r\nexactly the same kinds of fossil-remains, differing from those in the\r\nrocks above and below. I conclude therefore that the two rocks belong\r\nto about the same great age in the world's past history, when the\r\nsame animals were living upon the earth.\"\r\n\r\nObserving and reasoning thus, geologists have drawn up a general plan\r\nor order of strata; and the whole of the vast masses of water-built\r\nrocks throughout the world have been arranged in a regular succession\r\nof classes, rising step by step from earliest ages up to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICA THE OLD WORLD\r\n\r\n(FROM GEOLOGICAL SKETCHES.)\r\n\r\nBY L.

Hers was the first dry land lifted out of the waters, hers the\r\nfirst shore washed by the ocean that enveloped all the earth beside;\r\nand while Europe was represented only by islands rising here and there\r\nabove the sea, America already stretched an unbroken line of land from\r\nNova Scotia to the Far West.\r\n\r\nIn the present state of our knowledge, our conclusions respecting the\r\nbeginning of the earth's history, the way in which it took form and\r\nshape as a distinct, separate planet, must, of course, be very vague\r\nand hypothetical. Yet the progress of science is so rapidly\r\nreconstructing the past that we may hope to solve even this problem;\r\nand to one who looks upon man's appearance upon the earth as the\r\ncrowning work in a succession of creative acts, all of which have had\r\nrelation to his coming in the end, it will not seem strange that he\r\nshould at last be allowed to understand a history which was but the\r\nintroduction to his own existence. It is my belief that not only the\r\nfuture, but the past also, is the inheritance of man, and that we\r\nshall yet conquer our lost birthright.\r\n\r\nEven now our knowledge carries us far enough to warrant the assertion\r\nthat there was a time when our earth was in a state of igneous fusion,\r\nwhen no ocean bathed it and no atmosphere surrounded it, when no wind\r\nblew over it and no rain fell upon it, but an intense heat held all\r\nits materials in solution. In those days the rocks which are now the\r\nvery bones and sinews of our mother Earth--her granites, her\r\nporphyries, her basalts, her syenites--were melted into a liquid mass.\r\nAs I am writing for the unscientific reader, who may not be familiar\r\nwith the facts through which these inferences have been reached, I\r\nwill answer here a question which, were we talking together, he might\r\nnaturally ask in a somewhat sceptical tone. How do you know that this\r\nstate of things ever existed, and, supposing that the solid materials\r\nof which our earth consists were ever in a liquid condition, what\r\nright have you to infer that this condition was caused by the action\r\nof heat upon them? I answer, Because it is acting upon them still;\r\nbecause the earth we tread is but a thin crust floating on a liquid\r\nsea of molten materials; because the agencies that were at work then\r\nare at work now, and the present is the logical sequence of the past.\r\nFrom artesian wells, from mines, from geysers, from hot springs, a\r\nmass of facts has been collected, proving incontestably the heated\r\ncondition of all substances at a certain depth below the earth's\r\nsurface; and if we need more positive evidence, we have it in the\r\nfiery eruptions that even now bear fearful testimony to the molten\r\nocean seething within the globe and forcing its way but from time to\r\ntime. The modern progress of Geology has led us by successive and\r\nperfectly connected steps back to a time when what is now only an\r\noccasional and rare phenomenon was the normal condition of our earth;\r\nwhen the internal fires were enclosed by an envelope so thin that it\r\nopposed but little resistance to their frequent outbreak, and they\r\nconstantly forced themselves through this crust, pouring out melted\r\nmaterials that subsequently cooled and consolidated on its surface. So\r\nconstant were these eruptions, and so slight was the resistance they\r\nencountered, that some portions of the earlier rock-deposits are\r\nperforated with numerous chimneys, narrow tunnels as it were, bored by\r\nthe liquid masses that poured out through them and greatly modified\r\ntheir first condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IDEAL SECTION OF A VOLCANO IN ACTION.]\r\n\r\nThe question at once suggests itself, How was even this thin crust\r\nformed? what should cause any solid envelope, however slight and filmy\r\nwhen compared to the whole bulk of the globe, to form upon the surface\r\nof such a liquid mass? At this point of the investigation the\r\ngeologist must appeal to the astronomer; for in this vague and\r\nnebulous border-land, where the very rocks lose their outlines and\r\nflow into each other, not yet specialized into definite forms and\r\nsubstances,--there the two sciences meet. Astronomy shows us our\r\nplanet thrown off from the central mass of which it once formed a\r\npart, to move henceforth in an independent orbit of its own. That\r\norbit, it tells us, passed through celestial spaces cold enough to\r\nchill this heated globe, and of course to consolidate it externally.\r\nWe know, from the action of similar causes on a smaller scale and on\r\ncomparatively insignificant objects immediately about us, what must\r\nhave been the effect of this cooling process upon the heated mass of\r\nthe globe. All substances when heated occupy more space than they do\r\nwhen cold. Water, which expands when freezing, is the only exception\r\nto this rule. The first effect of cooling the surface of our planet\r\nmust have been to solidify it, and thus to form a film or crust over\r\nit. That crust would shrink as the cooling process went on; in\r\nconsequence of the shrinking, wrinkles and folds would arise upon it,\r\nand here and there, where the tension was too great, cracks and\r\nfissures would be produced. In proportion as the surface cooled, the\r\nmasses within would be affected by the change of temperature\r\noutside of them, and would consolidate internally also, the crust\r\ngradually thickening by this process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VOLCANO.]\r\n\r\nBut there was another element without the globe, equally powerful in\r\nbuilding it up. Fire and water wrought together in this work, if not\r\nalways harmoniously, at least with equal force and persistency. I have\r\nsaid that there was a time when no atmosphere surrounded the earth;\r\nbut one of the first results of the cooling of its crust must have\r\nbeen the formation of an atmosphere, with all the phenomena connected\r\nwith it,--the rising of vapors, their condensation into clouds, the\r\nfalling of rains, the gathering of waters upon its surface. Water is a\r\nvery active agent of destruction, but it works over again the\r\nmaterials it pulls down or wears away, and builds them up anew in\r\nother forms. As soon as an ocean washed over the consolidated crust of\r\nthe globe, it would begin to abrade the surfaces upon which it moved,\r\ngradually loosening and detaching materials, to deposit them again as\r\nsand or mud or pebbles at its bottom in successive layers, one above\r\nanother. Thus, in analyzing the crust of the globe, we find at once\r\ntwo kinds of rocks, the respective work of fire and water: the first\r\npoured out from the furnaces within, and cooling, as one may see any\r\nmass of metal cool that is poured out from a smelting-furnace to-day,\r\nin solid crystalline masses, without any division into separate layers\r\nor leaves; and the latter in successive beds, one over another, the\r\nheavier materials below, the lighter above, or sometimes in alternate\r\nlayers, as special causes may have determined successive deposits of\r\nlighter or heavier materials at some given spot.\r\n\r\nThere were many well-fought battles between geologists before it was\r\nunderstood that these two elements had been equally active in building\r\nup the crust of the earth. The ground was hotly contested by the\r\ndisciples of the two geological schools, one of which held that the\r\nsolid envelope of the earth was exclusively due to the influence of\r\nfire, while the other insisted that it had been accumulated wholly\r\nunder the agency of water. This difference of opinion grew up very\r\nnaturally; for the great leaders of the two schools lived in different\r\nlocalities, and pursued their investigations over regions where the\r\ngeological phenomena were of an entirely opposite character,--the one\r\nexhibiting the effect of volcanic eruptions, the other that of\r\nstratified deposits. It was the old story of the two knights on\r\nopposite sides of the shield, one swearing that it was made of gold,\r\nthe other that it was made of silver; and almost killing each other\r\nbefore they discovered that it was made of both. So prone are men to\r\nhug their theories and shut their eyes to any antagonistic facts, that\r\nit is related of Werner, the great leader of the Aqueous school, that\r\nhe was actually on his way to see a geological locality of especial\r\ninterest, but, being told that it confirmed the views of his\r\nopponents, he turned round and went home again, refusing to see what\r\nmight force him to change his opinions. If the rocks did not confirm\r\nhis theory, so much the worse for the rocks,--he would none of them.\r\nAt last it was found that the two great chemists, fire and water, had\r\nworked together in the vast laboratory of the globe, and since then\r\nscientific men have decided to work together also; and if they still\r\nhave a passage at arms occasionally over some doubtful point, yet the\r\nresults of their investigations are ever drawing them nearer to each\r\nother,--since men who study truth, when they reach their goal, must\r\nalways meet at last on common ground.\r\n\r\nThe rocks formed under the influence of heat are called, in geological\r\nlanguage, the Igneous, or, as some naturalists have named them, the\r\nPlutonic rocks, alluding to their fiery origin, while the others have\r\nbeen called Aqueous or Neptunic rocks, in reference to their origin\r\nunder the agency of water. A simpler term, however, quite as\r\ndistinctive, and more descriptive of their structure, is that of the\r\nstratified and massive or unstratified rocks. We shall see hereafter\r\nhow the relative position of these two classes of rocks and their\r\naction upon each other enable us to determine the chronology of the\r\nearth, to compare the age of her mountains, and, if we have no\r\nstandard by which to estimate the positive duration of her continents,\r\nto say at least which was the first-born among them, and how their\r\ncharacteristic features have been successfully worked out. I am aware\r\nthat many of these inferences, drawn from what is called \"the\r\ngeological record,\" must seem to be the work of the imagination. In a\r\ncertain sense this is true,--for imagination, chastened by correct\r\nobservation, is our best guide in the study of Nature. We are too apt\r\nto associate the exercise of this faculty with works of fiction, while\r\nit is in fact the keenest detective of truth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIKES.]\r\n\r\nBesides the stratified and massive rocks, there is still a third set,\r\nproduced by the contact of these two, and called, in consequence of\r\nthe changes thus brought about, the Metamorphic rocks. The effect of\r\nheat upon clay is to bake it into slate; limestone under the influence\r\nof heat becomes quick-lime, or, if subjected afterwards to the action\r\nof water, it is changed to mortar; sand under the same agency is\r\nchanged to a coarse kind of glass. Suppose, then, that a volcanic\r\neruption takes place in a region of the earth's surface where\r\nsuccessive layers of limestone, of clay, and of sandstone, have been\r\npreviously deposited by the action of water. If such an eruption has\r\nforce enough to break through these beds, the hot, melted masses will\r\npour out through the rent, flow over its edges, and fill all the\r\nlesser cracks and fissures produced by such a disturbance. What will\r\nbe the effect upon the stratified rocks? Wherever these liquid masses,\r\nmelted by a heat more intense than can be produced by any artificial\r\nmeans, have flowed over them or cooled in immediate contact with them,\r\nthe clays will be changed to slate, the limestone will have assumed a\r\ncharacter more like marble, while the sandstone will be vitrified.\r\nThis is exactly what has been found to be the case, wherever the\r\nstratified rocks have been penetrated by the melted masses from\r\nbeneath. They have been themselves partially melted by the contact,\r\nand when they have cooled again, their stratification, though still\r\nperceptible, has been partly obliterated, and their substance changed.\r\nSuch effects may often be traced in dikes, which are only the cracks\r\nin rocks filled by materials poured into them at some period of\r\neruption when the melted masses within the earth were thrown out and\r\nflowed like water into any inequality or depression of the surface\r\naround. The walls enclosing such a dike are often found to be\r\ncompletely altered by contact with its burning contents, and to have\r\nassumed a character quite different from the rocks of which they make\r\na part; while the mass itself which fills the fissure shows by the\r\ncharacter of its crystallization that it has cooled more quickly on\r\nthe outside, where it meets the walls, than at the centre.\r\n\r\nThe first two great classes of rocks, the unstratified and stratified\r\nrocks, represent different epochs in the world's physical history: the\r\nformer mark its revolutions, while the latter chronicle its periods of\r\nrest. All mountains and mountain-chains have been upheaved by great\r\nconvulsions of the globe, which rent asunder the surface of the earth,\r\ndestroyed the animals and plants living upon it at the time, and were\r\nthen succeeded by long intervals of repose, when all things returned\r\nto their accustomed order, ocean and river deposited fresh beds in\r\nuninterrupted succession, the accumulation of materials went on as\r\nbefore, a new set of animals and plants were introduced, and a time of\r\nbuilding up and renewing followed the time of destruction. These\r\nperiods of revolution are naturally more difficult to decipher than\r\nthe periods of rest; for they have so torn and shattered the beds they\r\nuplifted, disturbing them from their natural relations to each other,\r\nthat it is not easy to reconstruct the parts and give them coherence\r\nand completeness again. But within the last half-century this work has\r\nbeen accomplished in many parts of the world with an amazing degree of\r\naccuracy, considering the disconnected character of the phenomena to\r\nbe studied; and I think I shall be able to convince my readers that\r\nthe modern results of geological investigation are perfectly sound\r\nlogical inferences from well-established facts. In this, as in so many\r\nother things, we are but \"children of a larger growth.\" The world is\r\nthe geologist's great puzzle-box; he stands before it like the child\r\nto whom the separate pieces of his puzzle remain a mystery till he\r\ndetects their relation and sees where they fit, and then his fragments\r\ngrow at once into a connected picture beneath his hand....\r\n\r\nWhen geologists first turned their attention to the physical history\r\nof the earth, they saw at once certain great features which they took\r\nto be the skeleton and basis of the whole structure. They saw the\r\ngreat masses of granite forming the mountains and mountain-chains,\r\nwith the stratified rocks resting against their slopes; and they\r\nassumed that granite was the first primary agent, and that all\r\nstratified rocks must be of a later formation. Although this involved\r\na partial error, as we shall see hereafter when we trace the upheavals\r\nof granite even into comparatively modern periods, yet it held an\r\nimportant geological truth also; for, though granite formations are by\r\nno means limited to those early periods, they are nevertheless very\r\ncharacteristic of them, and are indeed the foundation-stones on which\r\nthe physical history of the globe is built.\r\n\r\nStarting from this landmark, the earlier geologists divided the\r\nworld's history into three periods. As the historian recognizes\r\nAncient History, the Middle Ages, and Modern History as distinct\r\nphases in the growth of the human race, so they distinguished between\r\nwhat they called the Primary period, when, as they believed, no life\r\nstirred on the surface of the earth; the Secondary or middle period,\r\nwhen animals and plants were introduced, and the land began to assume\r\ncontinental proportions; and the Tertiary period, or comparatively\r\nmodern geological times, when the physical features of the earth as\r\nwell as its inhabitants were approaching more nearly to the present\r\ncondition of things. But as their investigations proceeded, they found\r\nthat every one of these great ages of the world's history was divided\r\ninto numerous lesser epochs, each of which had been characterized by a\r\npeculiar set of animals and plants, and had been closed by some great\r\nphysical convulsion, disturbing and displacing the materials\r\naccumulated during such a period of rest.\r\n\r\nThe further study of these subordinate periods showed that what had\r\nbeen called Primary formations, namely, the volcanic or Plutonic rocks\r\nformerly believed to be confined to the first geological ages,\r\nbelonged to all the periods, successive eruptions having taken place\r\nat all times, pouring up through the accumulated deposits, penetrating\r\nand injecting their cracks, fissures, and inequalities, as well as\r\nthrowing out large masses on the surface. Up to our own day there has\r\nnever been a period when such eruptions have not taken place, though\r\nthey have been constantly diminishing in frequency and extent. In\r\nconsequence of this discovery, that rocks of igneous character were by\r\nno means exclusively characteristic of the earliest times, they are\r\nnow classified together upon very different grounds from those on\r\nwhich geologists first united them; though, as the name _Primary_ was\r\nlong retained, we still find it applied to them, even in geological\r\nworks of quite recent date. This defect of nomenclature is to be\r\nregretted, as likely to mislead the student, because it seems to refer\r\nto time; whereas it no longer signifies the age of the rocks, but\r\nsimply their character. The name Plutonic or Massive rocks is,\r\nhowever, now almost universally substituted for that of Primary.\r\n\r\nA wide field of investigation still remains to be explored by the\r\nchemist and the geologist together, in the mineralogical character of\r\nthe Plutonic rocks, which differs greatly in the different periods.\r\nThe earlier eruptions seem to have been chiefly granitic, though this\r\nmust not be understood in too wide a sense, since there are granite\r\nformations even as late as the Tertiary period; those of the middle\r\nperiods were mostly porphyries and basalts; while in the more recent\r\nones, lavas predominate. We have as yet no clew to the laws by which\r\nthis distribution of volcanic elements in the formation of the earth\r\nis regulated; but there is found to be a difference in the crystals of\r\nthe Plutonic rocks belonging to different ages, which, when fully\r\nunderstood may enable us to determine the age of any Plutonic rock by\r\nits mode of crystallization; so that the mineralogist will as readily\r\ntell you by its crystals whether a bit of stone of igneous origin\r\nbelongs to this or that period of the world's history, as the\r\npalæontologist will tell you by its fossils whether a piece of rock\r\nof aqueous origin belongs to the Silurian or Devonian or Carboniferous\r\ndeposits.\r\n\r\nAlthough subsequent investigations have multiplied so extensively not\r\nonly the number of geological periods, but also the successive\r\ncreations that have characterized them, yet the first general division\r\ninto three great eras was nevertheless founded upon a broad and true\r\ngeneralization. In the first stratified rocks in which any organic\r\nremains are found, the highest animals are fishes, and the highest\r\nplants are cryptogams; in the middle periods reptiles come in,\r\naccompanied by fern and moss forests; in later times quadrupeds are\r\nintroduced, with a dicotyledonous vegetation. So closely does the\r\nmarch of animal and vegetable life keep pace with the material\r\nprogress of the world, that we may well consider these three\r\ndivisions, included under the first general classification of its\r\nphysical history, as the three Ages of Nature; the more important\r\nepochs which subdivide them may be compared to so many great\r\ndynasties, while the lesser periods are the separate reigns contained\r\ntherein. Of such epochs there are ten, well known to geologists; of\r\nthe lesser periods about sixty are already distinguished, while many\r\nmore loom up from the dim regions of the past, just discerned by the\r\neye of science, though their history is not yet unravelled.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further, I will enumerate the geological epochs in\r\ntheir succession, confining myself, however, to such as are perfectly\r\nwell established, without alluding to those of which the limits are\r\nless definitely determined, and which are still subject to doubts and\r\ndiscussions among geologists. As I do not propose to make here any\r\ntreatise of Geology, but simply to place before my readers some\r\npictures of the old world, with the animals and plants that have\r\ninhabited it at various times, I shall avoid, as far as possible, all\r\ndebatable ground, and confine myself to those parts of my subject\r\nwhich are best known, and can therefore be more clearly presented.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOSSIL SCORPION.--SILURIAN PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nFirst, we have the Azoic period, _devoid of life_, as its name\r\nsignifies,--namely, the earliest stratified deposits upon the heated\r\nfilm forming the first solid surface of the earth, in which no trace\r\nof living thing has ever been found. Next comes the Silurian period,\r\nwhen the crust of the earth had thickened and cooled sufficiently to\r\nrender the existence of animals and plants upon it possible, and when\r\nthe atmospheric conditions necessary to their maintenance were already\r\nestablished. Many of the names given to these periods are by no means\r\nsignificant of their character, but are merely the result of accident:\r\nas, for instance, that of Silurian, given by Sir Roderick Murchison to\r\nthis set of beds, because he first studied them in that part of Wales\r\noccupied by the ancient tribe of the Silures. The next period, the\r\nDevonian, was for a similar reason named after the country of\r\nDevonshire in England, where it was first investigated. Upon this\r\nfollows the Carboniferous period, with the immense deposits of coal\r\nfrom which it derives its name. Then comes the Permian period, named,\r\nagain, from local circumstances, the first investigation of its\r\ndeposits having taken place in the province of Permia in Russia. Next\r\nin succession we have the Triassic period, so called from the trio of\r\nrocks, the red sandstone, Muschel Kalk (shell-limestone), and Keuper\r\n(clay), most frequently combined in its formations; the Jurassic, so\r\namply illustrated in the chain of the Jura, where geologists first\r\nfound the clew to its history; and the Cretaceous period, to which the\r\nchalk cliffs of England and all the extensive chalk deposits belong.\r\nUpon these follow the so-called Tertiary formations, divided into\r\nthree periods, all of which have received most characteristic names in\r\nthis epoch of the world's history we see the first approach to a\r\ncondition of things resembling that now prevailing, and Sir Charles\r\nLyell has most fitly named its three divisions, the Eocene, Miocene,\r\nand Pliocene. The termination of the three words is made from the\r\nGreek word _Kainos_, recent; while _Eos_ signifies dawn, _Meion_ less,\r\nand _Pleion_ more. Thus Eocene indicates the dawn of recent species,\r\nPliocene their increase, while Miocene, the intermediate term, means\r\nless recent. Above these deposits comes what has been called in\r\nscience the present period,--_the modern times_ of the geologist,--that\r\nperiod to which man himself belongs, and since the beginning of which,\r\nthough its duration be counted by hundreds of thousands of years,\r\nthere has been no alteration in the general configuration of the\r\nearth, consequently no important modification of its climatic\r\nconditions, and no change in the animals and plants inhabiting it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRUSTACEA.--DEVONIAN PERIOD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISH OF THE DEVONIAN PERIOD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISH OF THE CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOSSIL VEGETATION OF CARBONIFEROUS PERIOD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISH OF THE PERMIAN PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the first of these periods, the Azoic, as having\r\nbeen absolutely devoid of life, and I believe this statement to be\r\nstrictly true; but I ought to add that there is a difference of\r\nopinion among geologists upon this point, many believing that the\r\nfirst surface of our globe may have been inhabited by living beings,\r\nbut that all traces of their existence have been obliterated by the\r\neruptions of melted materials, which not only altered the character of\r\nthose earliest stratified rocks, but destroyed all the organic remains\r\ncontained in them. It will be my object to show, not only that the\r\nabsence of the climatic and atmospheric conditions essential to\r\norganic life, as we understand it, must have rendered the previous\r\nexistence of any living beings impossible, but also that the\r\ncompleteness of the Animal Kingdom in those deposits where we first\r\nfind organic remains, its intelligible and coherent connections with\r\nthe successive creations of all geological times and with the animals\r\nnow living, afford the strongest internal evidence that we have indeed\r\nfound in the lower Silurian formations, immediately following the\r\nAzoic, the beginning of life upon earth. When a story seems to us\r\ncomplete and consistent from the beginning to the end, we shall not\r\nseek for a first chapter, even though the copy in which we have read\r\nit be so torn and defaced as to suggest the idea that some portion of\r\nit may have been lost. The unity of the work, as a whole, is an\r\nincontestable proof that we possess it in its original integrity. The\r\nvalidity of this argument will be recognized, perhaps, only by those\r\nnaturalists to whom the Animal Kingdom has begun to appear as a\r\nconnected whole. For those who do not see order in Nature it can have\r\nno value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOSSILS OF TRIASSIC VEGETATION.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD OF THE JURASSIC PERIOD.(The Oldest Bird.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF BIRD OF THE CRETACEOUS PERIOD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF ANIMAL OF THE EOCENE PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nFor a table containing the geological periods in their succession, I\r\nwould refer to any modern text-book of Geology, or to an article in\r\nthe _Atlantic Monthly_ for March, 1862, upon \"Methods of Study in\r\nNatural History,\" where they are given in connection with the order of\r\nintroduction of animals upon earth.\r\n\r\nWere these sets of rocks found always in the regular sequence in which\r\nI have enumerated them, their relative age would be easily\r\ndetermined, for their superposition would tell the whole story: the\r\nlowest would, of course, be the oldest, and we might follow without\r\ndifficulty the ascending series, till we reached the youngest and\r\nuppermost deposits. But their succession has been broken up by\r\nfrequent and violent alterations in the configuration of the globe.\r\nLand and water have changed their level,--islands have been\r\ntransformed to continents,--sea-bottoms have become dry land, and dry\r\nland has sunk to form sea-bottoms,--Alps and Himalayas, Pyrenees and\r\nApennines, Alleghanies and Rocky Mountains, have had their stormy\r\nbirthdays since many of these beds have been piled one above another,\r\nand there are but few spots on the earth's surface where any number of\r\nthem may be found in their original order and natural position. When\r\nwe remember that Europe, which lies before us on the map as a\r\ncontinent, was once an archipelago of islands,--that, where the\r\nPyrenees raise their rocky barrier between France and Spain, the\r\nwaters of the Mediterranean and Atlantic met,--that, where the British\r\nChannel flows, dry land united England and France, and Nature in those\r\ndays made one country of the lands parted since by enmities deeper\r\nthan the waters that run between,--when we remember, in short, all the\r\nfearful convulsions that have torn asunder the surface of the earth,\r\nas if her rocky record had indeed been written on paper, we shall find\r\na new evidence of the intellectual unity which holds together the\r\nwhole physical history of the globe in the fact that through all the\r\nstorms of time the investigator is able to trace one unbroken thread\r\nof thought from the beginning to the present hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF ANIMAL OF THE MIOCENE PERIOD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF ANIMAL OF THE PLIOCENE PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nThe tree is known by its fruits,--and the fruits of chance are\r\nincoherence, incompleteness, unsteadiness, the stammering utterance of\r\nblind, unreasoning force. A coherence that binds all the geological\r\nages in one chain, a stability of purpose that completes in the beings\r\nborn to-day an intention expressed in the first creatures that swam in\r\nthe Silurian ocean or crept upon its shores, a steadfastness of\r\nthought, practically recognized by man, if not acknowledged by him,\r\nwhenever he traces the intelligent connection between the facts of\r\nNature and combines them into what he is pleased to call his system of\r\nGeology, or Zoölogy, or Botany,--these things are not the fruits of\r\nchance or of an unreasoning force, but the legitimate results of\r\nintellectual power. There is a singular lack of logic, as it seems to\r\nme, in the views of the materialistic naturalists. While they consider\r\nclassification, or, in other words, their expression of the relations\r\nbetween animals or between physical facts of any kind, as the work of\r\ntheir intelligence, they believe the relations themselves to be the\r\nwork of physical causes. The more direct inference surely is, that, if\r\nit requires an intelligent mind to recognize them, it must have\r\nrequired an intelligent mind to establish them. These relations\r\nexisted before man was created; they have existed ever since the\r\nbeginning of time; hence, what we call the classification of facts is\r\nnot the work of his mind in any direct original sense, but the\r\nrecognition of an intelligent action prior to his own existence.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no part of the world, certainly none familiar to\r\nscience, where the early geological periods can be studied with so\r\nmuch ease and precision as in the United States. Along their northern\r\nborders, between Canada and the United States, there runs the low line\r\nof hills known as the Laurentian Hills. Insignificant in height,\r\nnowhere rising more than fifteen hundred or two thousand feet above\r\nthe level of the sea, these are nevertheless the first mountains that\r\nbroke the uniform level of the earth's surface and lifted themselves\r\nabove the waters. Their low stature, as compared with that of other\r\nmore lofty mountain-ranges, is in accordance with an invariable rule,\r\nby which the relative age of mountains may be estimated. The oldest\r\nmountains are the lowest, while the younger and more recent ones tower\r\nabove their elders, and are usually more torn and dislocated also.\r\nThis is easily understood, when we remember that all mountains and\r\nmountain-chains are the result of upheavals, and that the violence of\r\nthe outbreak must have been in proportion to the strength of the\r\nresistance. When the crust of the earth was so thin that the heated\r\nmasses within easily broke through it, they were not thrown to so\r\ngreat a height, and formed comparatively low elevations, such as the\r\nCanadian hills or the mountains of Bretagne and Wales. But in later\r\ntimes, when young, vigorous giants, such as the Alps, the Himalayas,\r\nor, later still, the Rocky Mountains, forced their way out from their\r\nfiery prison-house, the crust of the earth was much thicker, and\r\nfearful indeed must have been the convulsions which attended their\r\nexit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PHYSICAL MAP OF THE UNITED STATES.]\r\n\r\nThe Laurentian Hills form, then, a granite range, stretching from\r\nEastern Canada to the Upper Mississippi, and immediately along its\r\nbase are gathered the Azoic deposits, the first stratified beds, in\r\nwhich the absence of life need not surprise us, since they were\r\nformed beneath a heated ocean. As well might we expect to find the\r\nremains of fish or shells or crabs at the bottom of geysers or of\r\nboiling springs, as on those early shores bathed by an ocean of which\r\nthe heat must have been so intense. Although, from the condition in\r\nwhich we find it, this first granite range has evidently never been\r\ndisturbed by any violent convulsion since its first upheaval, yet\r\nthere has been a gradual rising of that part of the continent; for the\r\nAzoic beds do not lie horizontally along the base of the Laurentian\r\nHills in the position in which they must originally have been\r\ndeposited, but are lifted and rest against their slopes. They have\r\nbeen more or less dislocated in this process, and are greatly\r\nmetamorphized by the intense heat to which they must have been\r\nexposed. Indeed, all the oldest stratified rocks have been baked by\r\nthe prolonged action of heat.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked how the materials for those first stratified deposits\r\nwere provided. In later times, when an abundant and various soil\r\ncovered the earth, when every river brought down to the ocean, not\r\nonly its yearly tribute of mud or clay or lime, but the débris of\r\nanimals and plants that lived and died in its waters or along its\r\nbanks, when every lake and pond deposited at its bottom in successive\r\nlayers the lighter or heavier materials floating in its waters and\r\nsettling gradually beneath them, the process by which stratified\r\nmaterials are collected and gradually harden into rock is more easily\r\nunderstood. But when the solid surface of the earth was only just\r\nbeginning to form, it would seem that the floating matter in the sea\r\ncan hardly have been in sufficient quantity to form any extensive\r\ndeposits. No doubt there was some abrasion even of that first crust;\r\nbut the more abundant source of the earliest stratification is to be\r\nfound in the submarine volcanoes that poured their liquid streams into\r\nthe first ocean. At what rate these materials would be distributed and\r\nprecipitated in regular strata it is impossible to determine; but that\r\nvolcanic materials were so deposited in layers is evident from the\r\nrelative position of the earliest rocks. I have already spoken of the\r\ninnumerable chimneys perforating the Azoic beds, narrow outlets of\r\nPlutonic rock, protruding through the earliest strata. Not only are\r\nsuch funnels filled with the crystalline mass of granite that flowed\r\nthrough them in a liquid state, but it has often poured over their\r\nsides, mingling with the stratified beds around. In the present state\r\nof our knowledge, we can explain such appearances only by supposing\r\nthat the heated materials within the earth's crust poured out\r\nfrequently, meeting little resistance,--that they then scattered and\r\nwere precipitated in the ocean around, settling in successive strata\r\nat its bottom,--that through such strata the heated masses within\r\ncontinued to pour again and again, forming for themselves the\r\nchimney-like outlets above mentioned.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, was the earliest American land,--a long, narrow island,\r\nalmost continental in its proportions, since it stretched from the\r\neastern borders of Canada nearly to the point where now the base of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains meets the plain of the Mississippi Valley. We may\r\nstill walk along its ridge and know that we tread upon the ancient\r\ngranite that first divided the waters into a northern and southern\r\nocean; and if our imaginations will carry us so far, we may look down\r\ntoward its base and fancy how the sea washed against this earliest\r\nshore of a lifeless world. This is no romance, but the bald, simple\r\ntruth; for the fact that this granite band was lifted out of the\r\nwaters so early in the history of the world, and has not since been\r\nsubmerged, has, of course, prevented any subsequent deposits from\r\nforming above it. And this is true of all the northern part of the\r\nUnited States. It has been lifted gradually, the beds deposited in one\r\nperiod being subsequently raised, and forming a shore along which\r\nthose of the succeeding one collected, so that we have their whole\r\nsequence before us. In regions where all the geological deposits\r\n(Silurian, Devonian, carboniferous, permian, triassic, etc.) are piled\r\none upon another, and we can get a glimpse of their internal relations\r\nonly where some rent has laid them open, or where their ragged edges,\r\nworn away by the abrading action of external influences, expose to\r\nview their successive layers, it must, of course, be more difficult to\r\nfollow their connection. For this reason the American continent offers\r\nfacilities to the geologist denied to him in the so-called Old World,\r\nwhere the earlier deposits are comparatively hidden, and the broken\r\ncharacter of the land, intersected by mountains in every direction,\r\nrenders his investigation still more difficult. Of course, when I\r\nspeak of the geological deposits as so completely unveiled to us here,\r\nI do not forget the sheet of drift which covers the continent from\r\nnorth to south, and which we shall discuss hereafter, when I reach\r\nthat part of my subject. But the drift is only a superficial and\r\nrecent addition to the soil, resting loosely above the other\r\ngeological deposits, and arising, as we shall see, from very different\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nIn this article I have intended to limit myself to a general sketch of\r\nthe formation of the Laurentian Hills with the Azoic stratified beds\r\nresting against them. In the Silurian epoch following the Azoic we\r\nhave the first beach on which any life stirred; it extended along the\r\nbase of the Azoic beds, widening by its extensive deposits the narrow\r\nstrip of land already upheaved. I propose ... to invite my readers to\r\na stroll with me along that beach.\r\n\r\nWith what interest do we look upon any relic of early human history!\r\nThe monument that tells of a civilization whose hieroglyphic records\r\nwe cannot even decipher, the slightest trace of a nation that vanished\r\nand left no sign of its life except the rough tools and utensils\r\nburied in the old site of its towns or villages, arouses our\r\nimagination and excites our curiosity. Men gaze with awe at the\r\ninscription on an ancient Egyptian or Assyrian stone; they hold with\r\nreverential touch the yellow parchment-roll whose dim, defaced\r\ncharacters record the meagre learning of a buried nationality; and the\r\nannouncement, that for centuries the tropical forests of Central\r\nAmerica have hidden within their tangled growth the ruined homes and\r\ntemples of a past race, stirs the civilized world with a strange, deep\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nTo me it seems, that to look on the first land that was ever lifted\r\nabove the waste of waters, to follow the shore where the earliest\r\nanimals and plants were created when the thought of God first\r\nexpressed itself in organic forms, to hold in one's hand a bit of\r\nstone from an old sea-beach, hardened into rock thousands of\r\ncenturies ago, and studded with the beings that once crept upon its\r\nsurface or were stranded there by some retreating wave, is even of\r\ndeeper interest to men than the relies of their own race, for these\r\nthings tell more directly of the thoughts and creative acts of God.\r\n\r\nStanding in the neighborhood of Whitehall, near Lake George, one may\r\nlook along such a seashore, and see it stretching westward and sloping\r\ngently southward as far as the eye can reach. It must have had a very\r\ngradual slope, and the waters must have been very shallow; for at that\r\ntime no great mountains had been uplifted, and deep oceans are always\r\nthe concomitants of lofty heights. We do not, however, judge of this\r\nby inference merely; we have an evidence of the shallowness of the sea\r\nin those days in the character of the shells found in the Silurian\r\ndeposits, which shows that they belonged in shoal waters.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the fossil remains of all times tell us almost as much of the\r\nphysical condition of the world at different epochs as they do of its\r\nanimal and vegetable population. When Robinson Crusoe first caught\r\nsight of the footprint on the sand, he saw in it more than the mere\r\nfootprint, for it spoke to him of the presence of men on his desert\r\nisland. We walk on the old geological shores, like Crusoe along his\r\nbeach, and the footprints we find there tell us, too, more than we\r\nactually see in them. The crust of our earth is a great cemetery,\r\nwhere the rocks are tombstones on which the buried dead have written\r\ntheir own epitaphs. They tell us not only who they were and when and\r\nwhere they lived, but much also of the circumstances under which they\r\nlived. We ascertain the prevalence of certain physical conditions at\r\nspecial epochs by the presence of animals and plants whose existence\r\nand maintenance required such a state of things, more than by any\r\npositive knowledge respecting it. Where we find the remains of\r\nquadrupeds corresponding to our ruminating animals, we infer not only\r\nland, but grassy meadows also, and an extensive vegetation; where we\r\nfind none but marine animals, we know the ocean must have covered the\r\nearth; the remains of large reptiles, representing, though in gigantic\r\nsize, the half aquatic, half terrestrial reptiles of our own period,\r\nindicate to us the existence of spreading marshes still soaked by the\r\nretreating waters; while the traces of such animals as live now in\r\nsand and shoal waters, or in mud, speak to us of shelving sandy\r\nbeaches and of mud-flats. The eye of the Trilobite tells us that the\r\nsun shone on the old beach where he lived; for there is nothing in\r\nnature without a purpose, and when so complicated an organ was made to\r\nreceive the light, there must have been light to enter it. The immense\r\nvegetable deposits in the Carboniferous period announce the\r\nintroduction of an extensive terrestrial vegetation; and the\r\nimpressions left by the wood and leaves of the trees show that these\r\nfirst forests must have grown in a damp soil and a moist atmosphere.\r\nIn short, all the remains of animals and plants hidden in the rocks\r\nhave something to tell of the climatic conditions and the general\r\ncircumstances under which they lived, and the study of fossils is to\r\nthe naturalist a thermometer by which he reads the variations of\r\ntemperature in past times, a plummet by which he sounds the depths of\r\nthe ancient oceans,--a register, in fact, of all the important\r\nphysical changes the earth has undergone.\r\n\r\nBut although the animals of the early geological deposits indicate\r\nshallow seas by their similarity to our shoal-water animals, it must\r\nnot be supposed that they are by any means the same. On the contrary,\r\nthe old shells, crustacea, corals, etc., represent types which have\r\nexisted in all times with the same essential structural elements, but\r\nunder different specific forms in the several geological periods. And\r\nhere it may not be amiss to say something of what are called by\r\nnaturalists _representative types_.\r\n\r\nThe statement that different sets of animals and plants have\r\ncharacterized the successive epochs is often understood as indicating\r\na difference of another kind than that which distinguishes animals now\r\nliving in different parts of the world. This is a mistake. There are\r\nso-called representative types all over the globe, united to each\r\nother by structural relations and separated by specific differences of\r\nthe same kind as those that unite and separate animals of different\r\ngeological periods. Take, for instance, mud-flats or sandy shores in\r\nthe same latitudes of Europe and America; we find living on each,\r\nanimals of the same structural character and of the same general\r\nappearance, but with certain specific differences, as of color, size,\r\nexternal appendages, etc. They represent each other on the two\r\ncontinents. The American wolves, foxes, bears, rabbits, are not the\r\nsame as the European, but those of one continent are as true to their\r\nrespective types as those of the other; under a somewhat different\r\naspect they represent the same groups of animals. In certain\r\nlatitudes, or under conditions of nearer proximity, these differences\r\nmay be less marked. It is well known that there is a great monotony\r\nof type, not only among animals and plants, but in the human races\r\nalso, throughout the Arctic regions; and some animals characteristic\r\nof the high North reappear under such identical forms in the\r\nneighborhood of the snow-fields in lofty mountains, that to trace the\r\ndifference between the ptarmigans, rabbits, and other gnawing animals\r\nof the Alps, for instance, and those of the Arctics, is among the most\r\ndifficult problems of modern science.\r\n\r\nAnd so it is also with the animated world of past ages; in similar\r\ndeposits of sand, mud, or lime, in adjoining regions of the same\r\ngeological age, identical remains of animals and plants may be found;\r\nwhile at greater distances, but under similar circumstances,\r\nrepresentative species may occur. In very remote regions, however,\r\nwhether the circumstances be similar or dissimilar, the general aspect\r\nof the organic world differs greatly, remoteness in space being thus\r\nin some measure an indication of the degree of affinity between\r\ndifferent faunæ. In deposits of different geological periods\r\nimmediately following each other, we sometimes find remains of animals\r\nand plants so closely allied to those of earlier or later periods that\r\nat first sight the specific differences are hardly discernible. The\r\ndifficulty of solving these questions, and of appreciating correctly\r\nthe differences and similarities between such closely allied\r\norganisms, explains the antagonistic views of many naturalists\r\nrespecting the range of existence of animals, during longer or shorter\r\ngeological periods; and the superficial way in which discussions\r\nconcerning the transition of species are carried on, is mainly owing\r\nto an ignorance of the conditions above alluded to. My own personal\r\nobservation and experience in these matters have led me to the\r\nconviction that every geological period has had its own\r\nrepresentatives, and that no single species has been repeated in\r\nsuccessive ages.\r\n\r\nThe laws regulating the geographical distribution of animals, and\r\ntheir combination into distinct zoölogical provinces called faunæ,\r\nwith definite limits, are very imperfectly understood as yet; but so\r\nclosely are all things linked together from the beginning that I am\r\nconvinced we shall never find the clew to their meaning till we carry\r\non our investigations in the past and the present simultaneously. The\r\nsame principle according to which animal and vegetable life is\r\ndistributed over the surface of the earth now, prevailed in the\r\nearliest geological periods. The geological deposits of all times have\r\nhad their characteristic faunæ under various zones, their zoölogical\r\nprovinces presenting special combinations of animal and vegetable life\r\nover certain regions, and their representative types reproducing in\r\ndifferent countries, but under similar latitudes, the same groups with\r\nspecific differences.\r\n\r\nOf course, the nearer we approach the beginning of organic life, the\r\nless marked do we find the differences to be, and for a very obvious\r\nreason. The inequalities of the earth's surface, her mountain-barriers\r\nprotecting whole continents from the Arctic winds, her open plains\r\nexposing others to the full force of the polar blasts, her snug\r\nvalleys and her lofty heights, her tablelands and rolling prairies,\r\nher river-systems and her dry deserts, her cold ocean-currents pouring\r\ndown from the high North on some of her shores, while warm ones from\r\ntropical seas carry their softer influence to others,--in short, all\r\nthe contrasts in the external configuration of the globe, with the\r\nphysical conditions attendant upon them, are naturally accompanied by\r\na corresponding variety in animal and vegetable life.\r\n\r\nBut in the Silurian age, when there were no elevations higher than the\r\nCanadian hills, when water covered the face of the earth, with the\r\nexception of a few isolated portions lifted above the almost universal\r\nocean, how monotonous must have been the conditions of life! And what\r\nshould we expect to find on those first shores? If we are walking on a\r\nsea-beach to-day, we do not look for animals that haunt the forests or\r\nroam over the open plains, or for those that live in sheltered valleys\r\nor in inland regions or on mountain-heights. We look for Shells, for\r\nMussels and Barnacles, for Crabs, for Shrimps, for Marine Worms, for\r\nStar-Fishes and Sea-Urchins, and we may find here and there a fish\r\nstranded on the sand or tangled in the seaweed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME RECORDS OF THE ROCKS\r\n\r\n(FROM A FIRST BOOK IN GEOLOGY.)\r\n\r\nBY N.S. SHALER, S.D.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Copyright, 1884, by N.S. Shaler.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe geologist cannot find his way back in the record of the great\r\nstone book, to the far-off day when life began. The various changes\r\nthat come over rocks from the action of heat, of water, and of\r\npressure, have slowly modified these ancient beds, so that they no\r\nlonger preserve the frames of the animals that were buried in them.\r\n\r\nThese old rocks, which are so changed that we cannot any longer make\r\nsure that any animals lived in them, are called the \"archæan,\" which\r\nis Greek for ancient. They were probably mud and sand and limestone\r\nwhen first made, but they have been changed to mica schists, gneiss,\r\ngranite, marble, and other crystalline rocks. When any rock becomes\r\ncrystalline, the fossils dissolve and disappear, as coins lose their\r\nstamp and form when they are melted in the jeweller's gold-pot.\r\n\r\nThese ancient rocks that lie deepest in the earth are very thick, and\r\nmust have taken a great time in building; great continents must have\r\nbeen worn down by rain and waves in order to supply the waste out of\r\nwhich they were made. It is tolerably certain that they took as much\r\ntime during their making as has been required for all the other times\r\nsince they were formed. During the vast ages of this archæan the life\r\nof our earth began to be. We first find many certain evidences of life\r\nin the rocks which lie on top of the archæan rock, and are known as\r\nthe Cambriani and Silurian periods. There we have creatures akin to\r\nour corals and crabs and worms, and others that are the distant\r\nkindred of the cuttle-fishes and of our lamp-shells. There were no\r\nbackboned animals, that is to say, no land mammals, reptiles, or\r\nfishes at this stage of the earth's history. It is not likely that\r\nthere was any land life except of plants and those forms like the\r\nlowest ferns, and probably mosses. Nor is it likely that there were\r\nany large continents as at the present time, but rather a host of\r\nislands lying where the great lands now are, the budding tops of the\r\ncontinents just appearing above the sea.\r\n\r\nAlthough the life of this time was far simpler than at the present\r\nday, it had about as great variety as we would find on our present\r\nsea-floors. There were as many different species living at the same\r\ntime on a given surface.\r\n\r\nThe Cambrian and Silurian time--the time before the coming of the\r\nfishes--must have endured for many million years without any great\r\nchange in the world. Hosts of species lived and died; half a dozen\r\ntimes or more the life of the earth was greatly changed. New species\r\ncame much like those that had gone before, and only a little gain here\r\nand there was perceptible at any time. Still, at the end of the\r\nSilurian, the life of the world had climbed some steps higher in\r\nstructure and in intelligence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. NORTH AMERICA IN CAMBRIAN TIME.]\r\n\r\nThe next set of periods is known as the Devonian. It is marked by the\r\nrapid extension of the fishes; for, although the fishes began in the\r\nuppermost Silurian, they first became abundant in this time. These,\r\nthe first strong-jawed tyrants of the sea, came all at once, like a\r\nrush of the old Norman pirates into the peaceful seas of Great\r\nBritain. They made a lively time among the sluggish beings of that\r\nolden sea. Creatures that were able to meet feebler enemies were swept\r\naway or compelled to undergo great changes, and all the life of the\r\noceans seems to have a spur given to it by these quicker-formed and\r\nquicker-willed animals. In this Devonian section of our rocks we have\r\nproofs that the lands were extensively covered with forests of low\r\nfern trees, and we find the first trace of air-breathing animals in\r\ncertain insects akin to our dragon-flies. In this stage of the earth's\r\nhistory the fishes grew constantly more plentiful, and the seas had a\r\ngreat abundance of corals and crinoids. Except for the fishes, there\r\nwere no very great changes in the character of the life from that\r\nwhich existed in the earlier time of the Cambrian and Silurian. The\r\nanimals are constantly changing, but the general nature of the life\r\nremains the same as in the earlier time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. RANICEPS LYELLI--COAL TIME SALAMANDER.]\r\n\r\nIn the Carboniferous or coal-bearing age, we have the second great\r\nchange in the character of the life on the earth. Of the earlier\r\ntimes, we have preserved only the rocks formed in the seas. But rarely\r\ndo we find any trace of the land life or even of the life that lived\r\nalong the shores. In this Carboniferous time, however, we have very\r\nextensive sheets of rocks which were formed in swamps in the way shown\r\nin the earlier part of this book. They constitute our coal-beds,\r\nwhich, though much worn away by rain and sea, still cover a large part\r\nof the land surface. These beds of coal grew in the air, and, although\r\nthe swamps where they were formed had very little animal life in them,\r\nwe find some fossils which tell us that the life of the land was\r\nmaking great progress; there are new insects, including beetles,\r\ncockroaches, spiders, and scorpions, and, what is far more important,\r\nthere are some air-breathing, back-boned animals, akin to the\r\nsalamanders and water-dogs of the present day. These were nearly as\r\nlarge as alligators, and of much the same shape, but they were\r\nprobably born from the egg in the shape of tadpoles and lived for a\r\ntime in the water as our young frogs, toads, and salamanders do. This\r\nis the first step upwards from the fishes to land vertebrates; and we\r\nmay well be interested in it, for it makes one most important advance\r\nin creatures through whose lives our own existence became possible.\r\nStill, these ancient woods of the coal period must have had little of\r\nthe life we now associate with the forests; there were still no birds,\r\nno serpents, no true lizards, no suck-giving animals, no flowers, and\r\nno fruits. These coal-period forests were sombre wastes of shade, with\r\nno sound save those of the wind, the thunder, and the volcano, or of\r\nthe running streams and the waves on the shores.\r\n\r\nIn the seas of the Carboniferous time, we notice that the ancient life\r\nof the earth is passing away. Many creatures, such as the trilobites,\r\ndie out, and many other forms such as the crinoids or sea lilies\r\nbecome fewer in kind and of less importance. These marks of decay in\r\nthe marine life continue into the beds just after the Carboniferous,\r\nknown as the Permian, which are really the last stages of the\r\ncoal-bearing period.\r\n\r\nWhen with the changing time we pass to the beds known as the Triassic,\r\nwhich were made just after the close of the Carboniferous time, we\r\nfind the earth undergoing swift changes in its life. The moist climate\r\nand low lands that caused the swamps to grow so rapidly have ceased to\r\nbe, and in their place we appear to have warm, dry air, and higher\r\nlands.\r\n\r\nOn these lands of the Triassic time the air-breathing life made very\r\nrapid advances. The plants are seen to undergo considerable changes.\r\nThe ferns no longer make up all the forests, but trees more like the\r\npines began to abound, and insects became more plentiful and more\r\nvaried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. CYCAS CIRCINALIS, AKIN TO HIGHEST PLANTS OF\r\nCOAL TIME.]\r\n\r\nHitherto the only land back-boned animal was akin to our salamanders.\r\nNow we have true lizards in abundance, many of them of large size.\r\nSome of them were probably plant-eaters, but most were flesh-eaters;\r\nsome seem to have been tenants of the early swamps, and some dwelt in\r\nthe forests.\r\n\r\nThe creatures related to the salamanders have increased in the variety\r\nof their forms to a wonderful extent. We know them best by the tracks\r\nwhich they have left on the mud stones formed on the borders of lakes\r\nor the edge of the sea. In some places these footprints are found in\r\namazing numbers and perfection. The best place for them is in the\r\nConnecticut Valley, near Turner's Falls, Mass. At this point the red\r\nsandstone and shale beds, which are composed of thin layers having a\r\ntotal thickness of several hundred feet, are often stamped over by\r\nthese footprints like the mud of a barnyard. From the little we can\r\ndetermine from these footprints, the creatures seem to have been\r\nsomewhat related to our frogs, but they generally had tails, and,\r\nthough provided with four legs, were in the habit of walking on the\r\nhind ones alone like the kangaroo. A few of these tracks are shown in\r\nthe figure on this page.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. FOOT-PRINTS, CONNECTICUT SANDSTONES.]\r\n\r\nThese strange creatures were of many different species. Some of them\r\nmust have been six or seven feet high, for their steps are as much as\r\nthree feet apart, and seem to imply a creature weighing several\r\nhundred pounds. Others were not bigger than robins. Strangely enough,\r\nwe have never found their bones nor the creatures on which they fed,\r\nand but for the formation of a little patch of rocks here and there we\r\nshould not have had even these footprints to prove to us that such\r\ncreatures had lived in the Connecticut Valley in this far-off time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. FOOT-PRINT, TURNER'S FALLS.]\r\n\r\nBut these wonderful forms are less interesting than two or three\r\nlittle fossil jaw-bones that prove to us that in this Triassic time\r\nthe earth now bore another animal more akin to ourselves, in the shape\r\nof a little creature that gave suck to its young. Once more life takes\r\na long upward step in this little opossum-like animal, perhaps the\r\nfirst creature whose young was born alive. These little creatures\r\ncalled Microlestes or Dromatherium, of which only one or two different\r\nbut related species have been found in England and in North Carolina,\r\nappear to have been insect-eaters of about the size and shape of the\r\nAustralian creature shown in Fig. 7. So far we know it in but few\r\nspecimens,--altogether only an ounce or two of bones,--but they are\r\nvery precious monuments of the past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. DROMATHERIUM SYLVESTRE AND TEETH OF MICROLESTES\r\nANTIQUUS.]\r\n\r\nIn this Triassic time the climate appears to have been rather dry, for\r\nin it we have many extensive deposits of salt formed by the\r\nevaporation of closed lakes, of seas, such as are now forming on the\r\nbottom of the Dead Sea, and the Great Salt Lake of Utah, and a hundred\r\nor more other similar basins of the present day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. MYRMECOBIUS.]\r\n\r\nIn the sea animals of this time we find many changes. Already some of\r\nthe giant lizard-like animals, which first took shape on the land, are\r\nbecoming swimming-animals. They changed their feet to paddles, which,\r\nwith the help of a flattened tail, force them through the water.\r\n\r\nThe fishes on which these great swimming lizards preyed are more like\r\nthe fishes of our present day than they were before. The trilobites\r\nare gone, and of the crinoids only a remnant is left. Most of the\r\ncorals of the earlier days have disappeared, but the mollusks have not\r\nchanged more than they did at several different times in the earliest\r\nstages of the earth's history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. ICHTHYOSAURUS AND PLESIOSAURUS.]\r\n\r\nAfter the Trias comes a long succession of ages in which the life of\r\nthe world is steadily advancing to higher and higher planes; but for a\r\nlong time there is no such startling change as that which came in the\r\npassage from the coal series of rocks to the Trias. This long set of\r\nperiods is known to geologists as the age of reptiles. It is well\r\nnamed, for the kindred of the lizards then had the control of the\r\nland. There were then none of our large fish to dispute their control,\r\nso they shaped themselves to suit all the occupations that could give\r\nthem a chance for a living. Some remained beasts of prey like our\r\nalligators, but grew to larger size; some took to eating the plants,\r\nand came to walk on their four legs as our ordinary beasts do, no\r\nlonger dragging themselves on their bellies as do the lizard and\r\nalligator, their lower kindred. Others became flying creatures like\r\nour bats, only vastly larger, often with a spread of wing of fifteen\r\nor twenty feet. Yet others, even as strangely shaped, dwelt with the\r\nsharks in the sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. REPTILES OF JURASSIC PERIOD.]\r\n\r\nIn this time of the earth's history we have the first bird-like forms.\r\nThey were feathered creatures, with bills carrying true teeth, and\r\nwith strong wings; but they were reptiles in many features, having\r\nlong, pointed tails such as none of our existing birds have. They show\r\nus that the birds are the descendants of reptiles, coming off from\r\nthem as a branch does from the parent tree. The tortoises began in\r\nthis series of rocks. At first they are marine or swimming forms, the\r\nbox-turtles coming later. Here too begin many of the higher insects.\r\nCreatures like moths and bees appear, and the forests are enlivened\r\nwith all the important kinds of insects, though the species were very\r\ndifferent from those now living.\r\n\r\nIn the age of reptiles the plants have made a considerable advance.\r\nPalms are plenty; forms akin to our pines and firs abound, and the old\r\nflowerless group of ferns begins to shrink in size, and no longer\r\nspreads its feathery foliage over all the land as before. Still there\r\nwere none of our common broad-leaved trees; the world had not yet\r\nknown the oaks, birches, maples, or any of our hard-wood trees that\r\nlose their leaves in autumn; nor were the flowering plants, those with\r\ngay blossoms, yet on the earth. The woods and fields were doubtless\r\nfresh and green, but they wanted the grace of blossoms, plants, and\r\nsinging-birds. None of the animals could have had the social qualities\r\nor the finer instincts that are so common among animals of the present\r\nday. There were probably no social animals like our ants and bees, no\r\nmerry singing creatures; probably no forms that went in herds. Life\r\nwas a dull round of uncared-for birth, cruel self-seeking, and of\r\ndeath. The animals at best were clumsy, poorly-endowed creatures, with\r\nhardly more intelligence than our alligators.\r\n\r\nThe little thread of higher life begun in the Microlestes and\r\nDromatherium, the little insect-eating mammals of the forest, is\r\nvisible all through this time. It held in its warm blood the powers of\r\nthe time to come, but it was an insignificant thing among the mighty\r\ncold-blooded reptiles of these ancient lands. There are several\r\nspecies of them, but they are all small, and have no chance to make\r\nheadway against the older masters of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe Jurassic or first part of the reptilian time shades insensibly\r\ninto the second part, called the Cretaceous, which immediately follows\r\nit. During this period the lands were undergoing perpetual changes;\r\nrather deep seas came to cover much of the land surfaces, and there is\r\nsome reason to believe that the climate of the earth became much\r\ncolder than it had been, at least in those regions where the great\r\nreptiles had flourished. It may be that it is due to a colder climate\r\nthat we owe the rapid passing away of this gigantic reptilian life of\r\nthe previous age. The reptiles, being cold-blooded, cannot stand even\r\na moderate winter cold, save when they are so small that they can\r\ncrawl deep into crevices in the rocks to sleep the winter away,\r\nguarded from the cold by the warmth of the earth. At any rate these\r\ngigantic animals rapidly ceased to be, so that by the middle of the\r\nCretaceous period they were almost all gone, except those that\r\ninhabited the sea; and at the end of this time they had shrunk to\r\nlizards in size. The birds continue to increase and to become more\r\nlike those of our day; their tails shrink away, their long bills lose\r\ntheir teeth; they are mostly water-birds of large size, and there are\r\nnone of our songsters yet; still they are for the first time perfect\r\nbirds, and no longer half-lizard in their nature.\r\n\r\nThe greatest change in the plants is found in the coming of the\r\nbroad-leaved trees belonging to the families of our oaks, maples, etc.\r\nNow for the first time our woods take on their aspect of to-day; pines\r\nand other cone-bearers mingle with the more varied foliage of\r\nnut-bearing or large-seeded trees. Curiously enough, we lose sight of\r\nthe little mammals of the earlier time. This is probably because there\r\nis very little in the way of land animals of this period preserved to\r\nus. There are hardly any mines or quarries in the beds of this age to\r\nbring these fossils to light. In the most of the other rocks there is\r\nmore to tempt man to explore them for coal ores or building stones.\r\n\r\nIn passing from the Cretaceous to the Tertiary, we enter upon the\r\nthreshold of our modern world. We leave behind all the great wonders\r\nof the old world, the gigantic reptiles, the forests of tree ferns,\r\nthe seas full of ammonites and belemnites, and come among the no less\r\nwonderful but more familiar modern forms. We come at once into lands\r\nand seas where the back-boned animals are the ruling beings. The\r\nreptiles have shrunk to a few low forms,--the small lizards, the\r\ncrocodiles and alligators, the tortoises and turtles, and, as if to\r\nmark more clearly the banishment of this group from their old empire,\r\nthe serpents, which are peculiarly degraded forms of reptiles which\r\nhave lost the legs they once had, came to be the commonest reptiles of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\nThe first mammals that have no pouches now appear. In earlier times,\r\nthe suck-giving animals all belonged to the group that contains our\r\nopossums, kangaroos, etc. These creatures are much lower and feebler\r\nthan the mammals that have no pouches. Although they have probably\r\nbeen on the earth two or three times as long as the higher mammals,\r\nthey have never attained any eminent success whatever; they cannot\r\nendure cold climates; none of them are fitted for swimming as are the\r\nseals and whales, or for flying as the bats, or for burrowing as the\r\nmoles; they are dull, weak things, which are not able to contend with\r\ntheir stronger, better-organized, higher kindred. They seem not only\r\nweak, but unable to fit themselves to many different kinds of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nIn the lower part of the Tertiary rocks, we find at once a great\r\nvariety of large beasts that gave suck to their young. It is likely\r\nthat these creatures had come into existence in a somewhat earlier\r\ntime in other lands, where we have not been able to study the fossils;\r\nfor to make their wonderful forms slowly, as we believe them to have\r\nbeen made, would require a very long time. It is probable that during\r\nthe Cretaceous time, in some land where we have not yet had a chance\r\nto study the rocks, these creatures grew to their varied forms, and\r\nthat in the beginning of the Tertiary time, they spread into the\r\nregions where we find their bones.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the Tertiary time, we find these lower kinsmen of man,\r\nthrough whom man came to be. The mammals were marked by much greater\r\nsimplicity and likeness to each other than they now have. There were\r\nprobably no monkeys, no horses, no bulls, no sheep, no goats, no\r\nseals, no whales, and no bats. All these animals had many-fingered\r\nfeet. There were no cloven feet like those of our bulls, and no solid\r\nfeet as our horses have. Their brains, which by their size give us a\r\ngeneral idea of the intelligence of the creature, are small; hence we\r\nconclude that these early mammals were less intelligent than those of\r\nour day.\r\n\r\nIt would require volumes to trace the history of the growth of these\r\nearly mammals, and show how they, step by step, came to their present\r\nhigher state. We will take only one of the simplest of these changes,\r\nwhich happens to be also the one which we know best. This is the\r\nchange that led to the making of our common horses, which seem to have\r\nbeen brought into life on the continent of North America. The most\r\nsingular thing about our horses is that the feet have but one large\r\ntoe or finger, the hoof, the hard covering of which is the nail of\r\nthat extremity. Now it seems hard to turn the weak, five-fingered\r\nfeet of the animals of the lower Tertiary--feet which seem to be\r\nbetter fitted for tree-climbing than anything else--into feet such as\r\nwe find in the horse. Yet the change is brought about by easy stages\r\nthat lead the successive creatures from the weak and loose-jointed\r\nfoot of the ancient forms to the solid, single-fingered horse's hoof,\r\nwhich is wonderfully well-fitted for carrying a large beast at a swift\r\nspeed, and is so strong a weapon of defence that an active donkey can\r\nkill a lion with a well-delivered kick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. FEET OF TERTIARY MAMMALS.]\r\n\r\nThe oldest of these creatures that lead to the horses is called\r\n_Eohippus_ or beginning horse. This fellow had on the forefeet four\r\nlarge toes, each with a small hoof and fifth imperfect one, which\r\nanswered to the thumb. The hind feet had gone further in the change,\r\nfor they each had but three toes, each with hoofs, the middle-toed\r\nhoof larger and longer than the others. A little later toward our day\r\nwe find another advance in the _Orohippus_, when the little imperfect\r\nthumb has disappeared, and there are only four toes on the forefeet\r\nand three on the hind.\r\n\r\nYet later we have the _Mesohippus_ or half-way horse. There are still\r\nthree toes on the hind foot, but one more of the fingers of the\r\nforefeet has disappeared. This time it is the little finger that goes,\r\nleaving only a small bone to show that its going was by a slow\r\nshrinking. The creature now has three little hoofs on each of its\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nStill nearer our own time comes the _Miohippus_, which shows the two\r\nside hoofs on each foot shrinking up so that they do not touch the\r\nground, but they still bear little hoofs. Lastly, about the time of\r\nman's coming on the earth, appears his faithful servant, the horse, in\r\nwhich those little side hoofs have disappeared, leaving only two\r\nlittle \"splint\" bones to mark the place where these side hoofs belong.\r\nThus, step by step, our horses' feet were built up; while these parts\r\nwere changing, the other parts of the animals were also slowly\r\naltering. They were at first smaller than our horses,--some of them\r\nnot as large as an ordinary Newfoundland dog; others as small as\r\nfoxes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. DEVELOPMENT OF HORSES'S FOOT.]\r\n\r\nAs if to remind us of his old shape, our horses now and then, but\r\nrarely, have, in place of the little splint bones above the hoof, two\r\nsmaller hoofs, just like the foot of _Miohippus_. Sometimes these are\r\nabout the size of a silver dollar, on the part that receives the shoe\r\nwhen horses are shod.\r\n\r\nIn this way, by slow-made changes, the early mammals pass into the\r\nhigher. Out of one original part are made limbs as different as the\r\nfeet of the horse, the wing of a bat, the paddle of a whale, and the\r\nhand of man. So with all the parts of the body the forms change to\r\nmeet the different uses to which they are put.\r\n\r\nAt the end of this long promise, which was written in the very first\r\nanimals, comes man himself, in form closely akin to the lower animals,\r\nbut in mind immeasurably apart from them. We can find every part of\r\nman's body in a little different shape in the monkeys, but his mind is\r\nof a very different quality. While his lower kindred cannot be made to\r\nadvance in intelligence any more than man himself can grow a horse's\r\nfoot or a bat's wing, he is constantly going higher and higher in his\r\nmental and moral growth.\r\n\r\nSo far we have found but few traces of man that lead us to suppose\r\nthat he has been for a long geological time on the earth, yet there is\r\ngood evidence that he has been here for a hundred thousand years or\r\nmore. It seems pretty clear that he has changed little in his body in\r\nall these thousands of generations. The earliest remains show us a\r\nlarge-brained creature, who used tools and probably had already made a\r\nservant of fire, which so admirably aids him in his work.\r\n\r\nBesides the development of this wonderful series of animals, that we\r\nmay call in a certain way our kindred, there have been several other\r\nremarkable advances in this Tertiary time, this age of crowning\r\nwonders in the earth's history. The birds have gone forward very\r\nrapidly; it is likely that there were no songsters at the first part\r\nof this period, but these singing birds have developed very rapidly in\r\nlater times. Among the insects the most remarkable growth is among the\r\nants, the bees, and their kindred. These creatures have very wonderful\r\nhabits; they combine together for the making of what we may call\r\nstates, they care for their young, they wage great battles, they keep\r\nslaves, they domesticate other insects, and in many ways their acts\r\nresemble the doings of man. Coming at about the same time as man,\r\nthese intellectual insects help to mark this later stage of the earth\r\nas the intellectual period in its history. Now for the first time\r\ncreatures are on the earth which can form societies and help each\r\nother in the difficult work of living.\r\n\r\nAmong the mollusks, the most important change is in the creation of\r\nthe great, strong swimming squids, the most remarkable creatures of\r\nthe sea. Some of these have arms that can stretch for fifty feet from\r\ntip to tip.\r\n\r\nAmong the plants, the most important change has been in the growth of\r\nflowering plants, which have been constantly becoming more plenty, and\r\nthe plants which bear fruits have also become more numerous. The\r\nbroad-leaved trees seem to be constantly gaining on the forests of\r\nnarrow-leaved cone-bearers, which had in an earlier day replaced the\r\nforests of ferns.\r\n\r\nIn these Tertiary ages, as in the preceding times of the earth, the\r\nlands and seas were much changed in their shape. It seems that in the\r\nearlier ages the land had been mostly in the shape of large islands\r\ngrouped close together where the continents now are. In this time,\r\nthese islands grew together to form the united lands of Europe, Asia,\r\nAfrica, Australia, and the twin American continents; so that, as life\r\nrose higher, the earth was better fitted for it. Still there were\r\ngreat troubles that it had to undergo. There were at least two\r\ndifferent times during the Tertiary age termed glacial periods, times\r\nwhen the ice covered a large part of the northern continents,\r\ncompelling life of all sorts to abandon great regions, and to find new\r\nplaces in more southern lands. Many kinds of animals and plants seem\r\nto have been destroyed in these journeys; but these times of trial, by\r\nremoving the weaker and less competent creatures, made room for new\r\nforms to rise in their places. All advance in nature makes death\r\nnecessary, and this must come to races as well as to individuals if\r\nthe life of the world is to go onward and upward.\r\n\r\nLooking back into the darkened past, of which we yet know but little\r\ncompared with what we would like to know, we can see the great armies\r\nof living beings led onward from victory to victory toward the higher\r\nlife of our own time. Each age sees some advance, though death\r\novertakes all its creatures. Those that escape their actual enemies or\r\naccident, fall a prey to old age: volcanoes, earthquakes, glacial\r\nperiods, and a host of other violent accidents sweep away the life of\r\nwide regions, yet the host moves on under a control that lies beyond\r\nthe knowledge of science. Man finds himself here as the crowning\r\nvictory of this long war. For him all this life appears to have\r\nstriven. In his hands lies the profit of all its toil and pain.\r\nSurely this should make us feel that our duty to all these living\r\nthings, that have shared in the struggle that has given man his\r\nelevation, is great, but above all, great is our duty to the powers\r\nthat have been placed in our bodies and our minds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GLACIER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PITCH LAKE IN THE WEST INDIES\r\n\r\n(FROM AT LAST.)\r\n\r\nBY C. KINGSLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COOLIE AND NEGRO.]\r\n\r\nThe Pitch Lake, like most other things, owes its appearance on the\r\nsurface to no convulsion or vagary at all, but to a most slow,\r\norderly, and respectable process of nature, by which buried vegetable\r\nmatter, which would have become peat, and finally brown coal, in a\r\ntemperate climate, becomes, under the hot tropic soil, asphalt and\r\noil, continually oozing up beneath the pressure of the strata above\r\nit....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs we neared the shore, we perceived that the beach was black with\r\npitch; and the breeze being off the land, the asphalt smell (not\r\nunpleasant) came off to welcome us. We rowed in, and saw in front of a\r\nlittle row of wooden houses a tall mulatto, in blue policeman's dress,\r\ngesticulating and shouting to us. He was the ward policeman, and I\r\nfound him (as I did all the colored police) able and courteous, shrewd\r\nand trusty. These police are excellent specimens of what can be made\r\nof the negro, or half-negro, if he be but first drilled, and then\r\ngiven a responsibility which calls out his self-respect. He was\r\nwarning our crew not to run aground on one or other of the pitch\r\nreefs, which here take the place of rocks. A large one, a hundred\r\nyards off on the left, has been almost all dug away, and carried to\r\nNew York or to Paris to make asphalt-pavement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POLICE STATION.]\r\n\r\nThe boat was run ashore, under his directions, on a spit of sand\r\nbetween the pitch; and when she ceased bumping up and down in the\r\nmuddy surf, we scrambled out into a world exactly the hue of its\r\ninhabitants of every shade, from jet black to copper-brown. The\r\npebbles on the shore were pitch. A tide-pool close by was enclosed in\r\npitch; a four-eyes was swimming about in it, staring up at us; and\r\nwhen we hunted him, tried to escape, not by diving, but by jumping on\r\nshore on the pitch, and scrambling off between our legs. While the\r\npoliceman, after profoundest courtesies, was gone to get a mule-cart\r\nto take us up to the lake, and planks to bridge its water channels,\r\nwe took a look round at this oddest of corners of the earth.\r\n\r\nIn front of us was the unit of civilization,--the police-station,\r\nwooden, on wooden stilts (as all well-built houses are here), to\r\ninsure a draught of air beneath them. We were, of course, asked to\r\ncome in and sit down, but preferred looking about, under our\r\numbrellas; for the heat was intense. The soil is half pitch, half\r\nbrown earth, among which the pitch sweals in and out as tallow sweals\r\nfrom a candle. It is always in slow motion under the heat of the\r\ntropic sun; and no wonder if some of the cottages have sunk right and\r\nleft in such a treacherous foundation. A stone or brick house could\r\nnot stand here; but wood and palm-thatch are both light and tough\r\nenough to be safe, let the ground give way as it will.\r\n\r\nThe soil, however, is very rich. The pitch certainly does not injure\r\nvegetation, though plants will not grow actually in it. The first\r\nplants which caught our eyes were pine-apples, for which La Brea is\r\nfamous. The heat of the soil, as well as the air, brings them to\r\nspecial perfection. They grow about anywhere, unprotected by hedge or\r\nfence; for the negroes here seem honest enough, at least toward each\r\nother; and at the corner of the house was a bush worth looking at, for\r\nwe had heard of it for many a year. It bore prickly, heart-shaped pods\r\nan inch long, filled with seeds coated with a red waxy pulp.\r\n\r\nThis was a famous plant--_Bixa orellana Roucou_; and that pulp was the\r\nwell-known annotto dye of commerce. In England and Holland it is used\r\nmerely, I believe, to color cheeses, but in the Spanish Main to color\r\nhuman beings. The Indian of the Orinoco prefers paint to clothes; and\r\nwhen he has \"roucoued\" himself from head to foot, considers himself in\r\nfull dress, whether for war or dancing. Doubtless he knows his own\r\nbusiness best from long experience. Indeed, as we stood broiling on\r\nthe shore, we began somewhat to regret that European manners and\r\ncustoms prevented our adopting the Guaraon and Arrawak fashion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MULE-CART.]\r\n\r\nThe mule-cart arrived; the lady of the party was put into it on a\r\nchair, and slowly bumped and rattled past the corner of Dundonald\r\nStreet--so named after the old sea-hero, who was, in his life-time,\r\nfull of projects for utilizing this same pitch--and up in pitch road,\r\nwith a pitch gutter on each side.\r\n\r\nThe pitch in the road has been, most of it, laid down by hand, and is\r\nslowly working down the slight incline, leaving pools and ruts full of\r\nwater, often invisible, because covered with a film of brown\r\npitch-dust, and so letting in the unwary walker over his shoes. The\r\npitch in the gutter-bank is in its native place, and as it spues\r\nslowly out of the soil into the ditch in odd wreaths and lumps, we\r\ncould watch, in little, the process which has produced the whole\r\ndeposit--probably the whole lake itself.\r\n\r\nA bullock-cart, laden with pitch, came jolting down past us, and we\r\nobserved that the lumps, when the fracture is fresh, have all a drawn\r\nout look; that the very air bubbles in them, which are often very\r\nnumerous, are all drawn out likewise, long and oval, like the\r\nair-bubbles in some ductile lavas.\r\n\r\nOn our left, as we went on, the bush was low, all of yellow cassia and\r\nwhite Hibiscus, and tangled with lovely convolvulus-like creepers,\r\nIpomoea and Echites, with white, purple or yellow flowers. On the\r\nright were negro huts and gardens, fewer and fewer as we went on,--all\r\nrich with fruit trees, especially with oranges, hung with fruit of\r\nevery hue; and beneath them, of course, the pine-apples of La Brea.\r\nEverywhere along the road grew, seemingly wild here, that pretty low\r\ntree, Cashew, with rounded yellow-veined leaves and little green\r\nflowers, followed by a quaint pink and red-striped pear, from which\r\nhangs, at the larger and lower end, a kidney-shaped bean, which bold\r\nfolk eat when roasted; but woe to those who try it when raw; for the\r\nacrid oil blisters the lips, and even while the beans are roasting the\r\nfumes of the oil will blister the cook's face if she holds it too near\r\nthe fire.\r\n\r\nAs we went onward up the gentle slope (the rise is one hundred and\r\nthirty-eight feet in rather more than a mile), the ground became more\r\nand more full of pitch, and the vegetation poorer and more rushy,\r\ntill it resembled, on the whole, that of an English fen. An Ipomoea or\r\ntwo, and a scarlet flowered dwarf Heliconia, kept up the tropic type,\r\nas does a stiff brittle fern about two feet high. We picked the weeds,\r\nwhich looked like English mint or basil, and found that most of them\r\nhad three longitudinal nerves in each leaf, and were really\r\nMelastomas, though dwarfed into a far meaner habit than that of the\r\nnoble forms we saw at Chaguanas, and again on the other side of the\r\nlake. On the right, too, in a hollow, was a whole wood of Groogroo\r\npalms, gray stemmed, gray leaved, and here and there a patch of white\r\nor black Roseau rose gracefully eight or ten feet high among the\r\nreeds.\r\n\r\nThe plateau of pitch now widened out, and the whole ground looked like\r\nan asphalt pavement, half overgrown with marsh-loving weeds, whose\r\nroots feed in the sloppy water which overlies the pitch. But, as yet,\r\nthere was no sign of the lake. The incline, though gentle, shuts off\r\nthe view of what is beyond. This last lip of the lake has surely\r\noverflowed, and is overflowing still, though very slowly. Its furrows\r\nall curve downward; and it is, in fact, as one of our party said, \"a\r\nblack glacier.\" The pitch, expanding under the burning sun of day,\r\nmust needs expand most toward the line of least resistance--that is,\r\ndownhill; and when it contracts again under the coolness of night, it\r\ncontracts, surely, from the same cause, more downhill than uphill; and\r\nso each particle never returns to the spot whence it started, but\r\nrather drags the particles above it downward toward itself. At least,\r\nso it seemed to us. Thus may be explained the common mistake which is\r\nnoticed by Messrs. Wall and Sawkins in their admirable description of\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\n\"All previous descriptions refer the bituminous matter scattered over\r\nthe La Brea district, and especially that between the village and the\r\nlake, to streams which have issued at some former epoch from the lake,\r\nand extended into the sea. This supposition is totally incorrect, as\r\nsolidification would probably have ensued before it had proceeded\r\none-tenth of the distance; and such of the asphalt as has undoubtedly\r\nescaped from the lake has not advanced more than a few yards, and\r\nalways presents the curved surfaces already described, and never\r\nappears as an extended sheet.\"\r\n\r\nAgreeing with this statement as a whole, I nevertheless cannot but\r\nthink it probable that a great deal of the asphalt, whether it be in\r\nlarge masses or in scattered veins, may be moving very slowly down\r\nhill, from the lake to the sea, by the process of expansion by day and\r\ncontraction by night, and may be likened to a caterpillar, or rather\r\ncaterpillars innumerable, progressing by expanding and contracting\r\ntheir rings, having strength enough to crawl down hill, but not\r\nstrength enough to back up hill again.\r\n\r\nAt last we surmounted the last rise, and before us lay the famous\r\nlake--not at the bottom of a depression, as we expected, but at the\r\ntop of a rise, whence the ground slopes away from it on two sides, and\r\nrises from it very slightly on the two others. The black pool glared\r\nand glittered in the sun. A group of islands, some twenty yards wide,\r\nwere scattered about the middle of it. Beyond it rose a double forest\r\nof Moriche fan-palms; and to the right of them high wood with giant\r\nMombins and undergrowth of Cocorite--a paradise on the other side of\r\nthe Stygian pool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PITCH LAKE.]\r\n\r\nWe walked, with some misgivings, on to the asphalt, and found it\r\nperfectly hard. In a few steps we were stopped by a channel of clear\r\nwater, with tiny fish and water-beetles in it; and, looking round, saw\r\nthat the whole lake was intersected with channels, so unlike anything\r\nwhich can be seen elsewhere that it is not easy to describe them.\r\n\r\nConceive a crowd of mushrooms, of all shapes, from ten to fifty feet\r\nacross, close together side by side, their tops being kept at exactly\r\nthe same level, their rounded rims squeezed tight against each other;\r\nthen conceive water poured on them so as to fill the parting seams,\r\nand in the wet season, during which we visited it, to overflow the\r\ntops somewhat. Thus would each mushroom represent, tolerably well, one\r\nof the innumerable flat asphalt bosses, which seem to have sprung up\r\neach from a separate centre, while the parting seams would be of much\r\nthe same shape as those in the asphalt, broad and shallow atop, and\r\nrolling downward in a smooth curve, till they are at bottom mere\r\ncracks from two to ten feet deep. Whether these cracks actually close\r\nup below, and the two contiguous masses of pitch become one, cannot be\r\nseen. As far as the eye goes down, they are two, though pressed close\r\nto each other. Messrs. Wall and Sawkins explain the odd fact clearly\r\nand simply. The oil, they say, which the asphalt contains when it\r\nrises first, evaporates in the sun, of course most on the outside of\r\nthe heap, leaving a thorough coat of asphalt, which has, generally, no\r\npower to unite with the corresponding coat of the next mass. Meanwhile\r\nMr. Manross, an American gentleman, who has written a very clever and\r\ninteresting account of the lake, seems to have been so far deceived by\r\nthe curved and squeezed edges of these masses that he attributes to\r\neach of them a revolving motion, and supposes that the material is\r\ncontinually passing from the centre to the edges, when it \"rolls\r\nunder,\" and rises again in the middle. Certainly the strange stuff\r\nlooks, at the first glance, as if it were behaving in this way; and\r\ncertainly, also, his theory would explain the appearance of sticks and\r\nlogs in the pitch. But Messrs. Wall and Sawkins say that they have\r\nobserved no such motion: nor did we; and I agree with them, that it is\r\nnot very obvious to what force, or what influence, it could be\r\nattributable. We must, therefore, seek some other way of accounting\r\nfor the sticks--which utterly puzzled us, and which Mr. Manross well\r\ndescribes as \"numerous pieces of wood, which, being involved in the\r\npitch, are constantly coming to the surface. They are often several\r\nfeet in length, and five or six inches in diameter. On reaching the\r\nsurface they generally assume an upright position, one end being\r\ndetained in the pitch, while the other is elevated by the lifting of\r\nthe middle. They may be seen at frequent intervals over the lake,\r\nstanding up to the height of two or even three feet. They look like\r\nstumps of trees protruding through the pitch; but their parvenu\r\ncharacter is curiously betrayed by a ragged cap of pitch which\r\ninvariably covers the top, and hangs down like hounds' ears on either\r\nside.\"\r\n\r\nWhence do they come? Have they been blown on to the lake, or left\r\nbehind by man? or are they fossil trees, integral parts of the\r\nvegetable stratum below which is continually rolling upward? or are\r\nthey of both kinds? I do not know. Only this is certain, as Messrs.\r\nWall and Sawkins have pointed out, that not only \"the purer varieties\r\nof asphalt, such as approach or are identical with asphalt glance,\r\nhave been observed\" (though not, I think, in the lake itself) \"in\r\nisolated masses, where there was little doubt of their proceeding from\r\nligneous substances of larger dimensions, such as roots and pieces of\r\ntrunks and branches,\" but, moreover, that \"it is also necessary to\r\nadmit a species of conversion by contact, since pieces of wood\r\nincluded accidentally in the asphalt, for example, by dropping from\r\noverhanging vegetation, are often found partially transformed into the\r\nmaterial.\" This is a statement which we verified again and again, as\r\nwe did the one which follows, namely, that the hollow bubbles which\r\nabound on the surface of the pitch \"generally contain traces of the\r\nlighter portion of vegetation,\" and \"are manifestly derived from\r\nleaves, etc., which are blown about the lake by the wind, and are\r\ncovered with asphalt, and, as they become asphalt themselves, give off\r\ngases which form bubbles round them.\"\r\n\r\nBut how is it that those logs stand up out of the asphalt, with\r\nasphalt caps and hounds' ears (as Mr. Manross well phrases it) on the\r\ntops of them?\r\n\r\nWe pushed on across the lake, over the planks which the negroes laid\r\ndown from island to island. Some, meanwhile, preferred a steeple-chase\r\nwith water-jumps, after the fashion of the midshipmen on a certain\r\nsecond visit to the lake. How the negroes grinned delight and surprise\r\nat the vagaries of English lads--a species of animal altogether new to\r\nthem; and how they grinned still more when certain staid and portly\r\ndignitaries caught the infection, and proved by more than one good\r\nleap that they too had been English school-boys--alas! long, long ago.\r\n\r\nSo, whether by bridging, leaping, or wading, we arrived at the little\r\nislands, and found them covered with a thick, low scrub; deep sedge,\r\nand among them Pinguins, like huge pine-apples without the apple; gray\r\nwild-pines, parasites on Matapalos, which, of course, have established\r\nthemselves, like robbers and vagrants as they are, everywhere; a true\r\nholly, with box-like leaves; and a rare cocoa-plum, very like the\r\nholly in habit, which seems to be all but confined to these little\r\npatches of red earth, afloat on the pitch. Out of the scrub, when we\r\nwere there, flew off two or three night-jars, very like our English\r\nspecies, save that they had white in the wings; and on the second\r\nvisit one of the midshipmen, true to the English boy's bird's-nesting\r\ninstinct, found one of their eggs, white-spotted, in a grass nest.\r\n\r\nPassing these little islands, which are said (I know not how truly) to\r\nchange their places and number, we came to the very fountains of Styx,\r\nto that part of the lake where the asphalt is still oozing up.\r\n\r\nAs the wind set toward us, we soon became aware of an evil\r\nsmell--petroleum and sulphureted hydrogen at once--which gave some of\r\nus a headache. The pitch here is yellow and white with sulphur foam;\r\nso are the water-channels; and out of both water and pitch innumerable\r\nbubbles of gas arise, loathsome to the smell. We became aware that the\r\npitch was soft under our feet. We left the impression of our boots;\r\nand if we had stood still awhile, we should soon have been ankle-deep.\r\nNo doubt there are spots where, if a man stayed long enough, he would\r\nbe slowly and horribly engulfed. \"But,\" as Mr. Manross says truly, \"in\r\nno place is it possible to form those bowl-like depressions round the\r\nobserver described by former travellers.\" What we did see is that the\r\nfresh pitch oozes out at the lines of least resistance, namely, in the\r\nchannels between the older and more hardened masses, usually at the\r\nupper ends of them, so that one may stand on pitch comparatively hard,\r\nand put one's hand into pitch quite liquid, which is flowing softly\r\nout, like some ugly fungoid growth, such as may be seen in old\r\nwine-cellars, into the water. One such pitch-fungus had grown several\r\nyards in length in the three weeks between our first and second visit;\r\nand on another, some of our party performed exactly the same feat as\r\nMr. Manross.\r\n\r\n\"In one of the star-shaped pools of water, some five feet deep, a\r\ncolumn of pitch had been forced perpendicularly up from the bottom. On\r\nreaching the surface of the water it had formed a sort of\r\ncentre-table, about four feet in diameter, but without touching the\r\nsides of the pool. The stem was about a foot in diameter. I leaped out\r\non this table, and found that it not only sustained my weight, but\r\nthat the elasticity of the stem enabled me to rock it from side to\r\nside. Pieces torn from the edges of this table sank readily, showing\r\nthat it had been raised by pressure, and not by its buoyancy.\"\r\n\r\nTrue, though strange; but stranger still did it seem to us when we did\r\nat last what the negroes asked us, and dipped our hands into the\r\nliquid pitch, to find that it did not soil the fingers. The old\r\nproverb that one cannot touch pitch without being defiled happily does\r\nnot stand true here, or the place would be intolerably loathsome. It\r\ncan be scraped up, moulded into any shape you will, wound in a string\r\n(as was done by one of the midshipmen) round a stick, and carried off;\r\nbut nothing is left on the hand save clean gray mud and water. It may\r\nbe kneaded for an hour before the mud be sufficiently driven out of it\r\nto make it sticky. This very abundance of earthy matter it is which,\r\nwhile it keeps the pitch from soiling, makes it far less valuable than\r\nit would be were it pure.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand whence this earthy matter (twenty or thirty\r\nper cent) comes. Throughout the neighborhood the ground is full, to\r\nthe depth of hundreds of feet, of coaly and asphaltic matter. Layers\r\nof sandstone or of shale containing this decayed vegetable alternate\r\nwith layers which contain none; and if, as seems probable, the coaly\r\nmatter is continually changing into asphalt and oil, and then working\r\nits way upward through every crack and pore, to escape from the\r\nenormous pressure of the superincumbent soil, it must needs carry up\r\nwith it innumerable particles of the soils through which it passes.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes we had seen, handled, and smelt enough to satisfy us\r\nwith this very odd and very nasty vagary of tropic nature; and as we\r\ndid not wish to become faint and ill between the sulphureted hydrogen\r\nand the blaze of the sun reflected off the hot black pitch, we hurried\r\non over the water-furrows, and through the sedge-beds to the farther\r\nshore--to find ourselves, in a single step, out of an Inferno into a\r\nParadise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STALAGMITE CAVE\r\n\r\n(FROM THE VOYAGE OF THE CHALLENGER.)\r\n\r\nBY SIR C. WYVILLE THOMSON, KT., LL.D., ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI think the Painter's Vale cave is the prettiest of the whole. The\r\nopening is not very large. It is an arch over a great mass of débris\r\nforming a steep slope into the cave, as if part of the roof of the\r\nvault had suddenly fallen in. At the foot of the bank of débris one\r\ncan barely see in the dim light the deep clear water lying perfectly\r\nstill and reflecting the roof and margin like a mirror. We clambered\r\ndown the slope, and as the eye became more accustomed to the obscurity\r\nthe lake stretched further back. There was a crazy little punt moored\r\nto the shore, and after lighting candles Captain Nares rowed the\r\nGovernor back into the darkness, the candles throwing a dim light for\r\na time--while the voices became more hollow and distant--upon the\r\nsurface of the water and the vault of stalactite, and finally passing\r\nback as mere specks into the silence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A GUIDE.]\r\n\r\nAfter landing the Governor on the opposite side, Captain Nares\r\nreturned for me, and we rowed round the weird little lake. It was\r\ncertainly very curious and beautiful; evidently a huge cavity out of\r\nwhich the calcareous sand had been washed or dissolved, and whose\r\nwalls, still to a certain extent permeable, had been hardened and\r\npetrified by the constant percolation of water charged with carbonate\r\nof lime. From the roof innumerable stalactites, perfectly white, often\r\nseveral yards long and coming down to the delicacy of knitting-needles,\r\nhung in clusters; and wherever there was any continuous crack in the\r\nroof or wall, a graceful, soft-looking curtain of white stalactite\r\nfell, and often ended, much to our surprise. Deep in the water\r\nStalagmites also rose up in pinnacles and fringes through the water,\r\nwhich was so exquisitely still and clear that it was something\r\ndifficult to tell where the solid marble tracery ended, and its\r\nreflected image began. In this cave, which is a considerable distance\r\nfrom the sea, there is a slight change of level with the tide\r\nsufficient to keep the water perfectly pure. The mouth of the cave is\r\novergrown with foliage, and every tree is draped and festooned with\r\nthe fragrant _Jasminum gracile_, mingled not unfrequently with the\r\n\"poison ivy\" (_Rhus toxicodendron_). The Bermudians, especially the\r\ndark people, have a most exaggerated horror of this bush. They imagine\r\nthat if one touch it or rub against it he becomes feverish, and is\r\ncovered with an eruption. This is no doubt entirely mythical. The\r\nplant is very poisonous, but the perfume of the flower is rather\r\nagreeable, and we constantly plucked and smelt it without its\r\nproducing any unpleasant effect. The tide was with us when we regained\r\nthe Flats Bridge, and the galley shot down the rapid like an arrow,\r\nthe beds of scarlet sponges and the great lazy trepangs showing\r\nperfectly clearly on the bottom at a fathom depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. CALCAREOUS CONCRETION SIMULATING A FOSSIL\r\nPALM-STEM, BOAZ ISLAND, BERMUDAS.]\r\n\r\nEvery here and there throughout the islands there are groups of bodies\r\nof very peculiar form projecting from the surface of the limestone\r\nwhere it has been weathered. These have usually been regarded as\r\nfossil palmetto stumps, the roots of trees which have been overwhelmed\r\nwith sand and whose organic matter has been entirely removed and\r\nreplaced by carbonate of lime. Fig. 1 represents one of the most\r\ncharacteristic of these from a group on the side of the road in Boaz\r\nIsland. It is a cylinder a foot in diameter and six inches or so high;\r\nthe upper surface forms a shallow depression an inch deep surrounded\r\nby a raised border; the bottom of the cup is even, and pitted over\r\nwith small depressions like the marks of rain-drops on sand; the walls\r\nof the cylinder seem to end a few inches below the surface of the\r\nlimestone in a rounded boss, and all over this there are round\r\nmarkings or little cylindrical projections like the origins of\r\nrootlets. The object certainly appears to agree even in every detail\r\nwith a fossil palm-root, and as the palmetto is abundant on the\r\nislands and is constantly liable to be destroyed by and ultimately\r\nenveloped in a mass of moving sand, it seemed almost unreasonable to\r\nquestion its being one. Still something about the look of these things\r\nmade me doubt, with General Nelson, whether they were fossil palms, or\r\nindeed whether they were of organic origin at all; and after carefully\r\nexamining and pondering over several groups of them, at Boaz Island,\r\non the shore at Mount Langton, and elsewhere, I finally came to the\r\nconclusion that they were not fossils, but something totally\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. CALCAREOUS CONCRETION IN AEOLIAN LIMESTONE,\r\nBERMUDAS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. CALCAREOUS CONCRETION IN AEOLIAN LIMESTONE,\r\nBERMUDAS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. CALCAREOUS CONCRETION, BERMUDAS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. CALCAREOUS CONCRETION IN AEOLIAN LIMESTONE,\r\nBERMUDAS.]\r\n\r\nThe form given in Fig. 1 is the most characteristic, and probably by\r\nfar the most common; but very frequently one of a group of these, one\r\nwhich is evidently essentially the same as the rest and formed in the\r\nsame way, has an oval or an irregular shape (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). In\r\nthese we have the same raised border, the same scars on the outside,\r\nthe same origins of root-like fibres, and the same pitting of the\r\nbottom of the shallow cup; but their form precludes the possibility of\r\ntheir being tree-roots. In some cases (Fig. 5), a group of so-called\r\n\"palm-stems\" is inclosed in a space surrounded by a ridge, and on\r\nexamining it closely this outer ridge is found to show the same\r\nleaf-scars and traces of rootlets as the \"palm-stems\" themselves. In\r\nsome cases very irregular honey-combed figures are produced which the\r\nexamination of a long series of intermediate forms shows to belong to\r\nthe same category (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. CONCRETIONS IN AEOLIAN ROCKS, BERMUDAS.]\r\n\r\nIn the caves in the limestone, owing to a thread of water having found\r\nits way in a particular direction through the porous stone of the\r\nroof, a drop falls age after age on one spot on the cave-floor,\r\naccurately directed by the stalactite which it is all the time\r\ncreating. The water contains a certain proportion of carbonate of\r\nlime, which is deposited as stalagmite as the water evaporates, and\r\nthus a ring-like crust is produced at a little distance from the spot\r\nwhere the drop falls. When a ring is once formed, it limits the spread\r\nof the drop, and determines the position of the wall bounding the\r\nlittle pool made by the drop. The floor of the cave gradually rises by\r\nthe accumulation of sand and travertine, and with it rise the walls\r\nand floor of the cup by the deposit of successive layers of stalagmite\r\nproduced by the drop percolating into the limestone of the floor which\r\nhardens it still further, but in this peculiar symmetrical way. From\r\nthe floor and sides of the cup the water oozes into the softer\r\nlimestone around and beneath; but, as in all these limestones, it does\r\nnot ooze indiscriminately, but follows certain more free paths. These\r\nbecome soon lined and finally blocked with stalagmite, and it is\r\nthese tubes and threads of stalagmite which afterwards in the\r\npseudo-fossil represent the diverging rootlets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A STALAGMITE CAVE.]\r\n\r\nSometimes when two or more drops fall from stalactites close to one\r\nanother the cups coalesce (Figs. 2, 3, and 4); sometimes one drop or\r\ntwo is more frequent than the other, and then we have the form shown\r\nin Figs. 3 and 4; sometimes many drops irregularly scattered form a\r\nlarge pool with its raised border, and a few drops more frequent and\r\nmore constant than the rest grow their \"palmetto stems\" within its\r\nlimit (Fig. 5); and sometimes a number of drops near one another make\r\na curious regular pattern, with the partitions between the recesses\r\nquite straight (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the rapid denudation which is going on in\r\nthese islands, and to the extent to which they have been denuded\r\nwithin comparatively recent times. The floors of caves, from their\r\nbeing cemented into a nearly homogeneous mass by stalagmitic matter,\r\nare much harder than the ordinary porous blown limestone; and it seems\r\nthat in many cases, after the rocks forming the walls and roof have\r\nbeen removed, disintegration has been at all events temporarily\r\narrested by the floor. Where there is a flat surface of rock exposed\r\nanywhere on the island, it very generally bears traces of having been\r\nat one time the floor of a cave; and as the weather-wearing of the\r\nsurface goes on, the old concretionary structures are gradually\r\nbrought out again, the parts specially hardened by a localized slow\r\ninfiltration of lime resist integration longest and project above the\r\ngeneral surface. Often a surface of weathered rock is so studded with\r\nthese symmetrical concretions, that it is hard to believe that one is\r\nnot looking at the calcified stumps of a close-growing grove of palms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BIG TREES OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n(FROM STUDIES SCIENTIFIC AND SOCIAL.)\r\n\r\nBY ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the popular accounts of these trees it is usual to dwell only on\r\nthe dimensions of the very largest known specimens, and sometimes even\r\nto exaggerate these. Even the smaller full-grown trees, however, are\r\nof grand dimensions, varying from fourteen to eighteen feet in\r\ndiameter, at six feet above the ground, and keeping nearly the same\r\nthickness for perhaps a hundred feet. In the south Calaveras grove,\r\nwhere there are more than a thousand trees, the exquisite beauty of\r\nthe trunks is well displayed by the numerous specimens in perfect\r\nhealth and vigor. The bark of these trees, seen at a little distance,\r\nis of a bright orange brown tint, delicately mottled with darker\r\nshades, and with a curious silky or plush-like gloss, which gives them\r\na richness of color far beyond that of any other conifer. The tree\r\nwhich was cut down soon after the first discovery of the species, the\r\nstump of which is now covered with a pavilion, is twenty-five feet in\r\ndiameter at six feet above the ground, but this is without the thick\r\nbark, which would bring it to twenty-seven feet when alive. A\r\nconsiderable portion of this tree still lies where it fell, and at one\r\nhundred and thirty feet from the base I found it to be still twelve\r\nand a half feet in diameter (or fourteen feet with the bark), while at\r\nthe extremity of the last piece remaining, two hundred and fifteen\r\nfeet from its base, it is six feet in diameter, or at least seven feet\r\nwith the bark. The height of this tree when it was cut down is not\r\nrecorded, but as one of the living trees is more than three hundred\r\nand sixty feet high, it is probable that this giant was not much short\r\nof four hundred feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"MOTHER OF THE FOREST.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying picture the dead tree in the centre is that from\r\nwhich the bark was stripped, which was erected in the Crystal Palace\r\nand unfortunately destroyed by fire. It is called the \"Mother of the\r\nForest.\" The two trees nearer the foreground are healthy, medium-sized\r\ntrees, about fifteen feet diameter at six feet above the ground.\r\n\r\nThe huge decayed trunk called \"Father of the Forest,\" which has fallen\r\nperhaps a century or more, exhibits the grandest dimensions of any\r\nknown tree. By measuring its remains, and allowing for the probable\r\nthickness of the bark, it seems to have been about thirty-five feet\r\ndiameter near the ground, at ninety feet up fifteen feet, and even at\r\na height of two hundred and seventy feet, it was nine feet in\r\ndiameter. It is within the hollow trunk of this tree that a man on\r\nhorse-back can ride--both man and horse being rather small; but the\r\ndimensions undoubtedly show that it was considerably larger than the\r\n\"Pavilion tree,\" and that it carried its huge dimensions to a greater\r\naltitude; and although this does not prove it to have been much\r\ntaller, yet it was in all probability more than four hundred feet in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVery absurd statements are made to visitors as to the antiquity of\r\nthese trees, three or four thousand years being usually given as their\r\nage. This is founded on the fact that while many of the large Sequoias\r\nare greatly damaged by fire, the large pines and firs around them are\r\nquite uninjured. As many of these pines are assumed to be near a\r\nthousand years old, the epoch of the \"great fire\" is supposed to be\r\nearlier still, and as the Sequoias have not outgrown the fire-scars in\r\nall that time, they are supposed to have then arrived at their full\r\ngrowth. But the simple explanation of these trees alone having\r\nsuffered so much from fire is, that their bark is unusually thick,\r\ndry, soft, and fibrous, and it thus catches fire more easily and\r\nburns more readily and for a longer time than that of the other\r\nconiferæ. Forest fires occur continually, and the visible damage done\r\nto these trees has probably all occurred in the present century.\r\nProfessor C.B. Bradley, of the University of California, has carefully\r\ncounted the rings of annual growth on the stump of the \"Pavilion\r\ntree,\" and found them to be twelve hundred and forty; and after\r\nconsidering all that has been alleged as to the uncertainty of this\r\nmode of estimating the age of a tree, he believes that in the climate\r\nof California, in the zone of altitude where these trees grow, the\r\nseasons of growth and repose are so strongly marked that the number of\r\nannual rings gives an accurate result.\r\n\r\nOther points that have been studied by Professor Bradley are, the\r\nreason why there are so few young trees in the groves, and what is the\r\ncause of the destruction of the old trees. To take the last point\r\nfirst, these noble trees seem to be singularly free from disease or\r\nfrom decay due to old age. All the trees that have been cut down are\r\nsolid to the heart, and none of the standing trees show any\r\nindications of natural decay. The only apparent cause for their\r\noverthrow is the wind, and by noting the direction of a large number\r\nof fallen trees it is found that the great majority of them lie more\r\nor less towards the south. This is not the direction of the prevalent\r\nwinds, but many of the tallest trees lean towards the south, owing to\r\nthe increased growth of their topmost branches towards the sun. They\r\nare then acted upon by violent gales, which loosen their roots, and\r\nwhatever the direction of the wind that finally overthrows them, they\r\nfall in the direction of the over-balancing top weight. The young\r\ntrees grow spiry and perfectly upright, but as soon as they overtop\r\nthe surrounding trees and get the full influence of the sun and wind,\r\nthe highest branches grow out laterally, killing those beneath their\r\nshade, and thus a dome-shaped top is produced. Taking into\r\nconsideration the health and vigor of the largest trees, it seems\r\nprobable that, under favorable conditions of shelter from violent\r\nwinds, and from a number of trees around them of nearly equal height,\r\nbig trees might be produced far surpassing in height and bulk any that\r\nhave yet been discovered. It is to be hoped that if any such are found\r\nto exist in the extensive groves of these trees to the south of those\r\nwhich are alone accessible to tourists, the Californian Government\r\nwill take steps to reserve a considerable tract containing them, for\r\nthe instruction and delight of future generations.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of young Sequoias strikes every visitor, the fact being\r\nthat they are only to be found in certain favored spots. These are,\r\neither where the loose débris of leaves and branches which covers the\r\nground has been cleared away by fire, or on the spots where trees have\r\nbeen uprooted. Here the young trees grow in abundance, and serve to\r\nreplace those that fall. The explanation of this is, that during the\r\nlong summer drought the loose surface débris is so dried up that the\r\nroots of the seedling Sequoias perish before they can penetrate the\r\nearth beneath. They require to germinate on the soil itself, and this\r\nthey are enabled to do when the earth is turned up by the fall of a\r\ntree, or where a fire has cleared off the débris. They also flourish\r\nunder the shade of the huge fallen trunks in hollow places, where\r\nmoisture is preserved throughout the summer. Most of the other\r\nconifers of these forests, especially the pines, have much larger\r\nseeds than the Sequoias, and the store of nourishment in these more\r\nbulky seeds enables the young plants to tide over the first summer's\r\ndrought. It is clear, therefore, that there are no indications of\r\nnatural decay in these forest giants. In every stage of their growth\r\nthey are vigorous and healthy, and they have nothing to fear except\r\nfrom the destroying hand of man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REDWOOD TREE WITH TRIPLE TRUNK.]\r\n\r\nDestruction from this cause is, however, rapidly diminishing both the\r\ngiant Sequoia and its near ally the noble redwood (_Sequoia\r\nsempervirens_), a tree which is more beautiful in foliage and in some\r\nother respects more remarkable than its brother species, while there\r\nis reason to believe that under favorable conditions it reaches an\r\nequally phenomenal size. It once covered almost all the coast ranges\r\nof central and northern California, but has been long since cleared\r\naway in the vicinity of San Francisco, and greatly diminished\r\nelsewhere. A grove is preserved for the benefit of tourists near Santa\r\nCruz, the largest tree being two hundred and ninety-six feet high,\r\ntwenty-nine feet diameter at the ground and fifteen feet at six feet\r\nabove it. One of these trees having a triple trunk is here figured\r\nfrom a photograph. Much larger trees, however, exist in the great\r\nforests of this tree in the northern part of the State; but these are\r\nrapidly being destroyed for the timber, which is so good and durable\r\nas to be in great demand. Hence Californians have a saying that the\r\nredwood is too good a tree to live. On the mountains a few miles east\r\nof the Bay of San Francisco, there are a number of patches of young\r\nredwoods, indicating where large trees have been felled, it being a\r\npeculiarity of this tree that it sends up vigorous young plants from\r\nthe roots of old ones immediately around the base. Hence in the\r\nforests these trees often stand in groups arranged nearly in a circle,\r\nthus marking out the size of the huge trunks of their parents. It is\r\nfrom this quality that the tree has been named _sempervirens_, or ever\r\nflourishing. Dr. Gibbons, of Alameda, who has explored all the remains\r\nof the redwood forests in the neighborhood of Oakland, kindly took me\r\nto see the old burnt-out stump of the largest tree he had discovered.\r\nIt is situated about fifteen hundred feet above the sea, and is\r\nthirty-four feet in diameter at the ground. This is as large as the\r\nvery largest specimens of the _Sequoia gigantea_, but it may have\r\nspread out more at the base and have been somewhat smaller above,\r\nthough this is not a special characteristic of the species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT IS EVOLUTION?\r\n\r\n(FROM THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY, MARCH, '93.)\r\n\r\nBY PROFESSOR E.S. HOLDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI was once trying to tell a boy, a friend of mine, what the scientific\r\nmen mean by the long word _Evolution_, and to give him some idea of\r\nthe plan of the world. I wanted an illustration of something that had\r\ngrown--evolved, developed--from small beginnings up through more and\r\nmore complicated forms, till it had reached some very complete form. I\r\ncould think of no better example than the railway by which we were\r\nsitting. The trains were running over the very track where a\r\nwagon-road had lately been, and before that a country cart-track, and\r\nbefore that a bridle-path, and before that again a mere trail for\r\ncattle. So I took the road for an example, and tried to show my boy\r\nhow it had grown from little things by slow degrees according to laws;\r\nand if you like, I will try to tell it again.\r\n\r\nJust as one can go further and further back, and always find a bird to\r\nbe the parent of the egg, and an egg to be the parent of that bird, so\r\nin the history of this road of ours; we may go back and back into the\r\npast, always finding something earlier, which is the cause of the\r\nsomething later. The earth, the planets, and the sun were all a fiery\r\nmist long ago. And in that mist, and in what came before it, we may\r\nlook for the origin of things as they are. But we must begin\r\nsomewhere. Let us begin with the landscape as we see it now,--hills,\r\nvalleys, streams, mountains, grass,--but with only a single tree.\r\n\r\nWe will not try to say how the tree came there. At least, we will not\r\ntry just yet. When we are through with the story you can say just as\r\nwell as I can.\r\n\r\nSuppose, then, a single oak-tree stood just on that hillside thousands\r\nand thousands of years ago. Grass was growing everywhere, and flowers,\r\ntoo. The seeds came with the winds. Year after year the oak-tree bore\r\nits acorns, hundreds and hundreds of them, and they fell on the grass\r\nbeneath and rolled down the smooth slopes, and sprouted as best they\r\ncould,--most of them uselessly so far as producing trees were\r\nconcerned,--but each one did its duty and furnished its green sprout,\r\nand died if it found no nourishment.\r\n\r\nAll the hundreds of acorns rolled down the slopes, Not one rolled up;\r\nand here was a _law_,--the law of gravitation,--in full activity.\r\nThere were scores of other laws active, too; for evolution had gone a\r\nlong way when we had an earth fit to be lived on, and hills in their\r\npresent shape, and a tree bearing acorns that would reproduce their\r\nkind. But ever since the fiery mist this simple law of gravitation has\r\nbeen acting, binding the whole universe together, making a\r\nrelationship between each clod and every other clod, and forcing\r\nevery stone, every acorn, and every rain-drop to move down and not up.\r\n\r\nJust as this law operates,--continuously, silently, inexorably,--so\r\nevery other law makes itself felt in its own sphere. Gravitation is\r\nsimple. The law according to which an acorn makes an oak--and not a\r\npine-tree is complex. But the laws of Nature are all alike, and if we\r\nunderstand the simple ones, we can at least partly comprehend the more\r\ncomplex. They are nothing but fixed habits on a large scale.\r\n\r\nSo the acorns fell year by year and sprouted; and one out of a\r\nthousand found good soil, and was not wasted, and made a tree. And so\r\nall around (below) the tree with which we started there grew a grove\r\nof oaks like it, in fact its children; and finally the original trees\r\ndied, but not without having left successors.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the green hillside is smooth and untrodden. There is\r\nnothing but grass and flowers, borne there by the winds, which leave\r\nno track. There is no animal life even in this secluded spot save the\r\nbirds, and they too leave no track. By and by there comes a hard\r\nwinter, or a dearth of food, and a pair of stray squirrels emigrate\r\nfrom their home in the valley below; and the history of our hill and\r\nits woods begins. Mere chance decides the choice of the particular\r\noak-tree in which the squirrels make their home. From the foot of this\r\ntree they make excursions here and there for their store of winter\r\nfood,--acorns and the like,--and they leave little paths on the\r\nhillside from tree to tree.\r\n\r\nThe best-marked paths run to the places where there are the most\r\nacorns. A little later on there are more squirrels in the colony,--the\r\nyoung of the parent pair, and other colonists from the valley. The\r\nlittle tracks become plainer and plainer.\r\n\r\nLater still come other wild animals in search of food,--squirrels will\r\ndo. The wild animals do not remain in the colony (there are too few\r\nsquirrels, and they are too hard to catch), but they pass through it,\r\nsometimes by day but oftenest by night.\r\n\r\nYou might think it was perfectly a matter of chance along which path a\r\nbear or a wolf passed, but it was not. He _could_ walk anywhere on the\r\nhillside; and sometimes he would be found far out of the paths that\r\nthe squirrels had begun. But usually, when he was in no haste, he took\r\nthe easiest path. The easiest one was that which went between the\r\nbushes and not through them; along the hillside and not straight up\r\nit; around the big rocks and not over them. The wolves and bears and\r\nfoxes have new and different wants when they come; and they break new\r\npaths to the springs where they drink, to the shade where they lie, to\r\nthe hollow trees where the bees swarm and store the wild honey.\r\n\r\nBut the squirrels were the first surveyors of these tracks. The bears\r\nand wolves are the engineers, who change the early paths to suit their\r\nspecial convenience.\r\n\r\nBy and by the Indian hunter comes to follow the wild game. He, too,\r\ntakes the easiest trail, the path of least resistance; and he follows\r\nthe track to the spring that the deer have made, and he drinks there.\r\nHe is an animal as they are, and he satisfies his animal wants\r\naccording to the same law that governs them.\r\n\r\nAfter generations of hunters, Indians, and then white men, there comes\r\na man on horseback looking for a house to live in. He, too, follows\r\nalong the easiest paths and stops at the spring; and near by he finds\r\nthe place he is looking for. Soon he returns, driving before him herds\r\nof cattle and flocks of sheep, which spread over the grassy glades to\r\nfeed. But everywhere they take the easiest place, the old paths, from\r\nthe shady tree to the flowing spring. After awhile the hillside is\r\nplainly marked with these sheep trails. You can see them now whenever\r\nyou go into the country, on every hillside.\r\n\r\nSoon there are neighbors who build their homes in the next valley, and\r\na good path must be made between the different houses.\r\n\r\nA few days' work spent in moving the largest stones, in cutting down\r\ntrees, and in levelling off a few steep slopes, makes a trail along\r\nwhich you can gallop your horse.\r\n\r\nThings move fast now,--history begins to be made quickly as soon as\r\nman takes a hand in it. Soon the trail is not enough: it must be\r\nwidened so that a wagon-load of boards for a new house can be carried\r\nin (for the settler has found a wife). After the first cart-track is\r\nmade to carry the boards and shingles in, a better road will be needed\r\nto haul firewood and grain out (for the wants of the new family have\r\nincreased, and things must be bought in the neighboring village with\r\nmoney, and money can only be had by selling the products of the farm).\r\nBy and by the neighborhood is so well inhabited that it is to the\r\nadvantage of the villages all around it to have good and safe and easy\r\nroads there; and the road is declared a public one, and it is\r\nregularly kept in repair and improved at the public expense. Do not\r\nforget the squirrels of long ago. They were the projectors of this\r\nroad. Their successors use it now,--men and squirrels alike,--and stop\r\nat the spring to drink, and under the huge oaks to rest.\r\n\r\nA few years more, and it becomes to the advantage of all to have a\r\nrailway through the valley and over the hillside. Then a young\r\nsurveyor, just graduated from college, comes with his chain-men and\r\nflag-men, and finds that the squirrels, and bears, and hunters, and\r\nall the rest have picked out the easiest way for him long centuries\r\nago. He makes his map, and soon the chief enigneer and the president\r\nof the road drive along in a buggy with a pair of fast horses\r\n(frightening the little squirrels off their road-way and into their\r\nholes), and the route of the Bear Valley and Quercus Railway is\r\nfinally selected, and here it is. See! there comes a train along the\r\ntrack. This is the way a railway route grew out of a squirrel path.\r\nThere are thousands of little steps, but you can trace them, or\r\nimagine them, as well as I can tell you.\r\n\r\nIt is the same all over the world. Stanley cut a track through the\r\nendless African forests. But it lay between the Pygmy villages, along\r\nthe paths they had made, and through the glades where they fought\r\ntheir battles with the storks.\r\n\r\nSometimes the first road is a river--the track is already cut. Try to\r\nfind out where the settlements in America were in the very early\r\ndays--before 1800. You will find them along the Hudson, the Juanita,\r\nthe St. Lawrence, the James, the Mississippi Rivers. But when these\r\nare left, men follow the squirrel-tracks and bear-tracks, or the\r\npaths of hunters, or the roads of Roman soldiers. It is a standing\r\npuzzle to little children why all the great rivers flow past the great\r\ntowns. (Why do they?) The answer to that question will tell you why\r\nthe great battles are fought in the same regions; why Egypt has been\r\nthe coveted prize of a dozen different conquerors (it is the gateway\r\nof the East); why our Civil War turned on the possession of the\r\nMississippi River. It is the roadways we fight for, the ways in and\r\nout, whether they be land or water. Of course, we really fought for\r\nsomething better than the mere possession of a roadway, but to get\r\nwhat we fought for we had to have the roadway first.\r\n\r\nThe great principle at the bottom of everything in Nature is that the\r\nfittest survives: or, as I think it is better to say it, in any\r\nparticular conflict or struggle that thing survives which is the\r\nfittest to survive _in this particular struggle_. This is Mr. Darwin's\r\ndiscovery,--or one of them,--and the struggle for existence is a part\r\nof the great struggle of the whole universe, and the laws of it make\r\nup the methods of Evolution--of Development.\r\n\r\nIt is clear now, is it not, how the railway route is the direct\r\ndescendant of the tiny squirrel track between two oaks? The process of\r\ndevelopment we call Evolution, and you can trace it all around you.\r\nWhy are your skates shaped in a certain way? Why is your gun rifled?\r\nWhy have soldiers two sets of (now) useless buttons on the skirts of\r\ntheir coats? (I will give you three guesses for this, and the hint\r\nthat you must think of cavalry soldiers.) Why are eagles' wings of\r\njust the size that they are? These and millions of like questions are\r\nto be answered by referring to the principle of development.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is hard to find the clew. Sometimes the development has\r\ngone so far, and the final product has become so complex and special,\r\nthat it takes a good deal of thinking to find out the real reasons.\r\nBut they _can_ be found, whether they relate to a fashion, to one of\r\nthe laws of our country, or to the colors on a butterfly's wing.\r\n\r\nThere is a little piece of verse intended to be comic, which, on the\r\ncontrary, is really serious and philosophical, if you understand it.\r\nLearn it by heart, and apply it to all kinds and conditions of things,\r\nand see if it does not help you to explain them to yourself....\r\n\r\n  \"And Man grew a thumb for that he had need of it,\r\n  And developed capacities for prey.\r\n  For the fastest men caught the most animals,\r\n  And the fastest animals got away from the most men.\r\n  Whereby all the slow animals were eaten,\r\n  And all the slow men starved to death.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THE SOIL IS MADE\r\n\r\n(FROM THE FORMATION OF VEGETABLE MOULD.)\r\n\r\nBY CHARLES DARWIN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W]\r\n\r\nWorms have played a more important part in the history of the world\r\nthan most persons would at first suppose. In almost all humid\r\ncountries they are extraordinarily numerous, and for their size\r\npossess great muscular power. In many parts of England a weight of\r\nmore than ten tons (10,516 kilogrammes) of dry earth annually passes\r\nthrough their bodies and is brought to the surface on each acre of\r\nland; so that the whole superficial bed of vegetable mould passes\r\nthrough their bodies in the course of every few years. From the\r\ncollapsing of the old burrows the mould is in constant though slow\r\nmovement, and the particles composing it are thus rubbed together. By\r\nthese means fresh surfaces are continually exposed to the action of\r\nthe carbonic acid in the soil, and of the humus-acids which appear to\r\nbe still more efficient in the decomposition of rocks. The generation\r\nof the humus-acids is probably hastened during the digestion of the\r\nmany half-decayed leaves which worms consume. Thus the particles of\r\nearth, forming the superficial mould, are subjected to conditions\r\neminently favorable for their decomposition and disintegration.\r\nMoreover, the particles of the softer rocks suffer some amount of\r\nmechanical trituration in the muscular gizzards of worms, in which\r\nsmall stones serve as mill-stones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM OF THE ALIMENTARY CANAL OF AN EARTH-WORM.]\r\n\r\nThe finely levigated castings, when brought to the surface in a moist\r\ncondition, flow during rainy weather down any moderate slope; and the\r\nsmaller particles are washed far down even a gently inclined surface.\r\nCastings when dry often crumble into small pellets and these are apt\r\nto roll down any sloping surface. Where the land is quite level and is\r\ncovered with herbage, and where the climate is humid so that much dust\r\ncannot be blown away, it appears at first sight impossible that there\r\nshould be any appreciable amount of sub-aerial denudation; but worm\r\ncastings are blown, especially while moist and viscid, in one uniform\r\ndirection by the prevalent winds which are accompanied by rain. By\r\nthese several means the superficial mould is prevented from\r\naccumulating to a great thickness; and a thick bed of mould checks in\r\nmany ways the disintegration of the underlying rocks and fragments of\r\nrock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WORM CASTING, FROM NICE. (Natural Size.)]\r\n\r\nThe removal of worm-castings by the above means leads to results which\r\nare far from insignificant. It has been shown that a layer of earth,.2\r\nof an inch in thickness, is in many places annually brought to the\r\nsurface per acre; and if a small part of this amount flows, or rolls,\r\nor is washed, even for a short distance, down every inclined surface,\r\nor is repeatedly blown in one direction, a great effect will be\r\nproduced in the course of ages. It was found by measurements and\r\ncalculations that on a surface with a mean inclination of 9° 26', 2.4\r\ncubic inches of earth which had been ejected by worms crossed, in the\r\ncourse of a year, a horizontal line one yard in length; so that two\r\nhundred and forty cubic inches would cross a line one hundred yards in\r\nlength. This latter amount in a damp state would weigh eleven and\r\none-half pounds. Thus, a considerable weight of earth is continually\r\nmoving down each side of every valley, and will in time reach its bed.\r\nFinally, this earth will be transported by the streams flowing in the\r\nvalleys into the ocean, the great receptacle for all matter denuded\r\nfrom the land. It is known from the amount of sediment annually\r\ndelivered into the sea by the Mississippi, that its enormous\r\ndrainage-area must on an average be lowered.00263 of an inch each\r\nyear; and this would suffice in four and a half million years to lower\r\nthe whole drainage-area to the level of the seashore. So that if a\r\nsmall fraction of the layer of fine earth,.2 of an inch in thickness,\r\nwhich is annually brought to the surface by worms, is carried away, a\r\ngreat result cannot fail to be produced within a period which no\r\ngeologist considers extremely long.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION THROUGH ONE OF THE DRUIDICAL STONES AT\r\nSTONEHENGE, SHOWING HOW MUCH IT HAD SUNK INTO THE GROUND.\r\n\r\n(Scale, 1/2 inch to 1 foot.)]\r\n\r\nArchaeologists ought to be grateful to worms, as they protect and\r\npreserve for an indefinitely long period every object, not liable to\r\ndecay, which is dropped on the surface of the land, by burying it\r\nbeneath their castings. Thus, also, many elegant and curious\r\ntesselated pavements and other ancient remains have been preserved;\r\nthough no doubt the worms have in these cases been largely aided by\r\nearth washed and blown from the adjoining land, especially when\r\ncultivated. The old tesselated pavements have, however, often suffered\r\nby having subsided unequally from being unequally undermined by the\r\nworms. Even old massive walls may be undermined and subside; and no\r\nbuilding is in this respect safe, unless the foundations lie six or\r\nseven feet beneath the surface, at a depth at which worms cannot work.\r\nIt is probable that many monoliths and some old walls have fallen\r\ndown from having been undermined by worms.\r\n\r\nWorms prepare the ground in an excellent manner for the growth of\r\nfibrous-rooted plants and for seedlings of all kinds. They\r\nperiodically expose the mould to the air, and sift it so that no\r\nstones larger than the particles which they can swallow are left in\r\nit. They mingle the whole intimately together, like a gardener who\r\nprepares fine soil for his choicest plants. In this state it is well\r\nfitted to retain moisture and to absorb all soluble substances, as\r\nwell as for the process of nitrification. The bones of dead animals,\r\nthe harder parts of insects, the shells of land mollusks, leaves,\r\ntwigs, etc., are before long all buried beneath the accumulated\r\ncastings of worms, and are thus brought in a more or less decayed\r\nstate within reach of the roots of plants. Worms likewise drag an\r\ninfinite number of dead leaves and other parts of plants into their\r\nburrows, partly for the sake of plugging them up and partly as food.\r\n\r\nThe leaves which are dragged into the burrows as food, after being\r\ntorn into the finest shreds, partially digested and saturated with the\r\nintestinal and urinary secretions, are commingled with much earth.\r\nThis earth forms the dark-colored, rich humus which almost everywhere\r\ncovers the surface of the land with a fairly well-defined layer or\r\nmantle. Von Hensen placed two worms in a vessel eighteen inches in\r\ndiameter, which was filled with sand, on which fallen leaves were\r\nstrewed; and these were soon dragged into their burrows to a depth of\r\nthree inches. After about six weeks an almost uniform layer of sand, a\r\ncentimetre (.4 inch) in thickness, was converted into humus by having\r\npassed through the alimentary canals of these two worms. It is\r\nbelieved by some persons that worm-burrows, which often penetrate the\r\nground almost perpendicularly to a depth of five or six feet,\r\nmaterially aid in its drainage; notwithstanding that the viscid\r\ncastings piled over the mouths of the burrows prevent or check the\r\nrain-water directly entering them. They allow the air to penetrate\r\ndeeply into the ground. They also greatly facilitate the downward\r\npassage of roots of moderate size; and these will be nourished by the\r\nhumus with which the burrows are lined. Many seeds owe their\r\ngermination to having been covered by castings; and others buried to a\r\nconsiderable depth beneath accumulated castings lie dormant, until at\r\nsome future time they are accidentally uncovered and germinate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A WORM CASTING FROM SOUTH INDIA. (Natural Size.)]\r\n\r\nWorms are poorly provided with sense-organs, for they cannot be said\r\nto see, although they can just distinguish between light and darkness;\r\nthey are completely deaf, and have only a feeble power of smell; the\r\nsense of touch alone is well developed. They can, therefore, learn\r\nlittle about the outside world, and it is surprising that they should\r\nexhibit some skill in lining their burrows with their castings and\r\nwith leaves, and in the case of some species in piling up their\r\ncastings into tower-like constructions. But it is far more surprising\r\nthat they should apparently exhibit some degree of intelligence\r\ninstead of a mere blind, instinctive impulse, in their manner of\r\nplugging up the mouths of their burrows. They act in nearly the same\r\nmanner as would a man, who had to close a cylindrical tube with\r\ndifferent kinds of leaves, petioles, triangles of paper, etc., for\r\nthey commonly seize such objects by their pointed ends. But with thin\r\nobjects a certain number are drawn in by their broader ends. They do\r\nnot act in the same unvarying manner in all cases, as do most of the\r\nlower animals; for instance, they do not drag in leaves by their\r\nfoot-stalks, unless the basil part of the blade is as narrow as the\r\napex, or narrower than it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen we behold a wide, turf-covered expanse, we should remember that\r\nits smoothness, on which so much of its beauty depends, is mainly due\r\nto all the inequalities having been slowly levelled by worms. It is a\r\nmarvellous reflection that the whole of the superficial mould over any\r\nsuch expanse has passed, and will again pass, every few years through\r\nthe bodies of worms. The plough is one of the most ancient and most\r\nvaluable of man's inventions; but long before he existed the land was\r\nin fact regularly ploughed, and, still continues to be thus ploughed\r\nby earth-worms. It may be doubted whether there are many other animals\r\nwhich have played so important a part in the history of the world, as\r\nhave these lowly organized creatures. Some other animals, however,\r\nstill more lowly organized, namely, corals, have done far more\r\nconspicuous work in having constructed innumerable reefs and islands\r\nin the great oceans; but these are almost confined to the tropical\r\nzones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZOÖLOGICAL MYTHS\r\n\r\n(FROM FACTS AND FICTIONS OF ZOÖLOGY.)\r\n\r\nBY ANDREW WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the country swain, loitering along some lane, comes to a\r\nstandstill to contemplate, with awe and wonder, the spectacle of a\r\nmass of the familiar \"hair-eels\" or \"hair-worms\" wriggling about in a\r\npool, he plods on his way firmly convinced that, as he has been taught\r\nto believe, he has just witnessed the results of the transformation of\r\nsome horse's hairs into living creatures. So familiar is this belief\r\nto people of professedly higher culture than the countryman, that the\r\ntransformation just alluded to has to all, save a few thinking persons\r\nand zoölogists, become a matter of the most commonplace kind. When\r\nsome quarrymen, engaged in splitting up the rocks, have succeeded in\r\ndislodging some huge mass of stone, there may sometimes be seen to hop\r\nfrom among the débris a lively toad or frog, which comes to be\r\nregarded by the excavators with feelings akin to those of\r\nsuperstitious wonder and amazement. The animal may or may not be\r\ncaptured; but the fact is duly chronicled in the local newspapers, and\r\npeople wonder for a season over the phenomenon of a veritable Rip Van\r\nWinkle of a frog, which to all appearance, has lived for \"thousands of\r\nyears in the solid rock.\" Nor do the hair-worm and the frog stand\r\nalone in respect of their marvellous origin. Popular zoölogy is full\r\nof such marvels. We find unicorns, mermaids, and mermen; geese\r\ndeveloped from the shell-fish known as \"barnacles\"; we are told that\r\ncrocodiles may weep, and that sirens can sing--in short, there is\r\nnothing so wonderful to be told of animals that people will not\r\nbelieve the tale. Whilst, curiously enough, when they are told of\r\nveritable facts of animal life, heads begin to shake and doubts to be\r\nexpressed, until the zoölogist despairs of educating people into\r\ndistinguishing fact from fiction, and truth from theories and\r\nunsupported beliefs. The story told of the old lady, whose youthful\r\nacquaintance of seafaring habits entertained her with tales of the\r\nwonders he had seen, finds, after all, a close application in the\r\nworld at large. The dame listened with delight, appreciation, and\r\nbelief, to accounts of mountains of sugar and rivers of rum, and to\r\ntales of lands where gold and silver and precious stones were more\r\nthan plentiful. But when the narrator descended to tell of fishes that\r\nwere able to raise themselves out of the water in flight, the old\r\nlady's credulity began to fancy itself imposed upon; for she\r\nindignantly repressed what she considered the lad's tendency to\r\nexaggeration, saying, \"Sugar mountains may be, and rivers of rum may\r\nbe, but fish that flee ne'er can be!\" Many popular beliefs concerning\r\nanimals partake of the character of the old lady's opinions regarding\r\nthe real and fabulous; and the circumstance tells powerfully in favor\r\nof the opinion that a knowledge of our surroundings in the world, and\r\nan intelligent conception of animal and plant life, should form part\r\nof the school-training of every boy and girl, as the most effective\r\nantidote to superstitions and myths of every kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLYING FISH.]\r\n\r\nThe tracing of myths and fables is a very interesting task, and it\r\nmay, therefore, form a curious study, if we endeavor to investigate\r\nvery briefly a few of the popular and erroneous beliefs regarding\r\nlower animals. The belief regarding the origin of the hair-worms is\r\nboth widely spread and ancient. Shakespeare tells us that\r\n\r\n                                  \"Much, is breeding\r\n  Which, like the courser's hair, hath, yet but life,\r\n  And not a serpent's poison.\"\r\n\r\nThe hair-worms certainly present the appearance of long, delicate\r\nblack hairs, which move about with great activity amidst the mud of\r\npools and ditches. These worms, in the early stages of their\r\nexistence, inhabit the bodies of insects, and may be found coiled up\r\nwithin the grasshopper, which thus gives shelter to a guest exceeding\r\nmany times the length of the body of its host. Sooner or later the\r\nhair-worm, or _Gordius aquaticus_ as the naturalist terms it, leaves\r\nthe body of the insect, and lays its eggs, fastened together in long\r\nstrings, in water. From each egg a little creature armed with minute\r\nhooks is produced, and this young hair-worm burrows its way into the\r\nbody of some insect, there to repeat the history of its parent. Such\r\nis the well-ascertained history of the hair-worm, excluding entirely\r\nthe popular belief in its origin. There certainly does exist in\r\nscience a theory known as that of \"spontaneous generation,\" which, in\r\nancient times, accounted for the production of insects and other\r\nanimals by assuming that they were produced in some mysterious fashion\r\nout of lifeless matter. But not even the most ardent believer in the\r\nextreme modification of this theory which holds a place in modern\r\nscientific belief, would venture to maintain the production of a\r\nhair-worm by the mysterious vivification of an inert substance such as\r\na horse's hair.\r\n\r\nThe expression \"crocodile's tears\" has passed into common use, and it\r\ntherefore may be worth while noting the probable origin of this myth.\r\nShakespeare, with that wide extent of knowledge which enabled him to\r\ndraw similes from every department of human thought, says that\r\n\r\n                          \"Gloster's show\r\n  Beguiles him, as the mournful crocodile\r\n  With sorrow snares relenting passengers.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet thus indicates the belief that not only do crocodiles shed\r\ntears, but that sympathizing passengers, turning to commiserate the\r\nreptile's woes, are seized and destroyed by the treacherous creatures.\r\nThat quaint and credulous old author--the earliest writer of English\r\nprose--Sir John Mandeville, in his \"Voiage,\" or account of his\r\n\"Travile,\" published about 1356--in which, by the way, there are to be\r\nfound accounts of not a few wonderful things in the way of zoölogical\r\ncuriosities--tells us that in a certain \"contre and be all yonde, ben\r\ngreat plenty of Crokodilles, that is, a manner of a long Serpent as I\r\nhave seyed before.\" He further remarks that \"these Serpents slew men,\"\r\nand devoured them, weeping; and he tells us, too, that \"whan thei\r\neaten thei meven (move) the over jowe (upper jaw), and nought the\r\nnether (lower) jowe: and thei have no tonge (tongue).\" Sir John thus\r\nstates two popular beliefs of his time and of days prior to his age,\r\nnamely, that crocodiles move their upper jaws, and that a tongue was\r\nabsent in these animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROCODILE.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the tears of the crocodile, no foundation of fact exists\r\nfor the belief in such sympathetic exhibitions. But a highly probable\r\nexplanation may be given of the manner in which such a belief\r\noriginated. These reptiles unquestionably emit very loud and\r\nsingularly plaintive cries, compared by some travellers to the\r\nmournful howling of dogs. The earlier and credulous travellers would\r\nvery naturally associate tears with these cries, and, once begun, the\r\nsupposition would be readily propagated, for error and myth are ever\r\nplants of quick growth. The belief in the movement of the upper jaw\r\nrests on apparent basis of fact. The lower jaw is joined to the skull\r\nvery far back on the latter, and the mouth-opening thus comes to be\r\nsingularly wide; whilst, when the mouth opens, the skull and upper jaw\r\nare apparently observed to move. This is not the case, however; the\r\napparent movement arising from the manner in which the lower jaw and\r\nthe skull are joined together. The belief in the absence of the tongue\r\nis even more readily explained. When the mouth is widely opened, no\r\ntongue is to be seen. This organ is not only present, but is,\r\nmoreover, of large size; it is, however, firmly attached to the floor\r\nof the mouth, and is specially adapted, from its peculiar form and\r\nstructure, to assist these animals in the capture and swallowing of\r\ntheir prey.\r\n\r\nOne of the most curious fables regarding animals which can well be\r\nmentioned, is that respecting the so-called \"Bernicle\" or \"Barnacle\r\nGeese,\" which by the naturalists and educated persons of the Middle\r\nAges were believed to be produced by those little Crustaceans named\r\n\"Barnacles.\" With the \"Barnacles\" every one must be familiar who has\r\nexamined the floating driftwood of the sea-beach, or who has seen\r\nships docked in a seaport town. A barnacle is simply a kind of crab\r\nenclosed in a triangular shell, and attached by a fleshy stalk to\r\nfixed objects. If the barnacle is not familiar to readers, certain\r\nnear relations of these animals must be well known, by sight at least,\r\nas amongst the most familiar denizens of our sea-coast. These latter\r\nare the \"Sea-Acorn,\" or Balani, whose little conical shells we crush\r\nby hundreds as we walk over the rocks at low-water mark; whilst every\r\nwooden pile immersed in the sea becomes coated in a short time with a\r\nthick crust of the \"Sea-Acorns.\" If we place one of these little\r\nanimals, barnacle, or sea-acorn--the latter wanting the stalk of the\r\nformer--in its native waters, we shall observe a beautiful little\r\nseries of feathery plumes to wave backward and forward, and ever and\r\nanon to be quickly withdrawn into the secure recesses of the shell.\r\nThese organs are the modified feet of the animal, which not only serve\r\nfor sweeping food-particles into the mouth, but act also as\r\nbreathing-organs. We may, therefore, find it a curious study to\r\ninquire through what extraordinary transformation and confusion of\r\nideas such an animal could be credited with giving origin to a\r\nveritable goose; and the investigation of the subject will also afford\r\na singularly apt illustration of the ready manner in which the fable\r\nof one year or period becomes transmitted and transformed into the\r\nsecure and firm belief of the next.\r\n\r\nWe may begin our investigation by inquiring into some of the opinions\r\nwhich were entertained on this subject and ventilated by certain old\r\nwriters. Between 1154 and 1189 Giraldus Cambrensis, in a work entitled\r\n\"Topographia Hiberniae,\" written in Latin, remarks concerning \"many\r\nbirds which are called Bernacae: against nature, nature produces them\r\nin a most extraordinary way. They are like marsh geese, but somewhat\r\nsmaller. They are produced from fir timber tossed along the sea, and\r\nare at first like gum. Afterward they hang down by their beaks, as if\r\nfrom a seaweed attached to the timber, surrounded by shells, in order\r\nto grow more freely,\" Giraldus is here evidently describing the\r\nbarnacles themselves. He continues: \"Having thus, in process of time,\r\nbeen clothed with a strong coat of feathers, they either fall into the\r\nwater or fly freely away into the air. They derive their food and\r\ngrowth from the sap of the wood or the sea, by a secret and most\r\nwonderful process of alimentation. I have frequently, with my own\r\neyes, seen more than a thousand of these small bodies of birds,\r\nhanging down on the seashore from one piece of timber, enclosed in\r\nshells, and already formed.\" Here, again, our author is speaking of\r\nthe barnacles themselves, with which he naturally confuses the geese,\r\nsince he presumes the Crustaceans are simply geese in an undeveloped\r\nstate. He further informs his readers that, owing to their presumably\r\nmarine origin, \"bishops and clergymen in some parts of Ireland do not\r\nscruple to dine off these birds at the time of fasting, because they\r\nare not flesh, nor born of flesh,\" although for certain other and\r\ntheological reasons, not specially requiring to be discussed in the\r\npresent instance, Giraldus disputes the legality of this practice of\r\nthe Hibernian clerics.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1527 appeared \"The Hystory and Croniclis of Scotland, with\r\nthe cosmography and dyscription thairof, compilit be the noble Clerk\r\nMaister Hector Boece, Channon of Aberdene.\" Boece's \"History\" was\r\nwritten in Latin; the title we have just quoted being that of the\r\nEnglish version of the work (1540), which title further sets forth\r\nthat Boece's work was \"Translait laitly in our vulgar and commoun\r\nlangage be Maister Johne Bellenden, Archedene of Murray, And\r\nImprentit in Edinburgh, be me Thomas Davidson, prenter to the Kyngis\r\nnobyll grace.\" In this learned work the author discredits the popular\r\nideas regarding the origin of the geese. \"Some men belevis that thir\r\nclakis (geese) growis on treis be the nebbis (bills). Bot thair\r\nopinoun is vane. And becaus the nature and procreatioun of thir clakis\r\nis strange, we have maid na lytyll laboure and deligence to serche ye\r\ntreuth and verite yairof, we have salit (sailed) throw ye seis quhare\r\nthir clakis ar bred, and I fynd be gret experience, that the nature of\r\nthe seis is mair relevant caus of thair procreatioun than ony uthir\r\nthyng.\" According to Boece, then, \"the nature of the seis\" formed the\r\nchief element in the production of the geese, and our author proceeds\r\nto relate how \"all treis (trees) that ar casein in the seis be proces\r\nof tyme apperis first wormeetin (worm-eaten), and in the small boris\r\nand hollis (holes) thairof growis small worms.\" Our author no doubt\r\nhere alludes to the ravages of the Teredo, or ship-worm, which burrows\r\ninto timber, and with which the barnacles themselves are thus\r\nconfused. Then he continues, the \"wormis\" first \"schaw (show) thair\r\nheid and feit, and last of all thay schaw thair plumis and wyngis.\r\nFinaly, quhen thay ar cumyn to the just mesure and quantite of geis,\r\nthay fle in the aire as othir fowlis dois, as was notably provyn, in\r\nthe yeir of God ane thousand iii hundred lxxxx, in sicht of mony\r\npepyll, besyde the castell of Petslego.\" On the occasion referred to,\r\nBoece tells us that a great tree was cast on shore, and was divided,\r\nby order of the \"laird\" of the ground, by means of a saw. Wonderful to\r\nrelate, the tree was found not merely to be riddled with a \"multitude\r\nof wormis,\" throwing themselves out of the holes of the tree, but some\r\nof the \"wormis\" had \"baith heid, feit, and wyngis,\" but, adds the\r\nauthor, \"they had no fedderis (feathers).\"\r\n\r\nUnquestionably, either \"the scientific use of the imagination\" had\r\noperated in this instance in inducing the observers to believe that in\r\nthis tree, riddled by the ship-worms and possibly having barnacles\r\nattached to it, they beheld young geese; or Boece had construed the\r\nappearances described as those representing the embryo stages of the\r\nbarnacle geese.\r\n\r\nBoece further relates how a ship named the Christofir was brought to\r\nLeith, and was broken down because her timbers had grown old and\r\nfailing. In these timbers were beheld the same \"wormeetin\"\r\nappearances, \"all the hollis thairof\" being \"full of geis.\" Boece\r\nagain most emphatically rejects the idea that the \"geis\" were produced\r\nfrom the wood of which the timbers were composed, and once more\r\nproclaims his belief that the \"nature of the seis resolvit in geis\"\r\nmay be accepted as the true and final explanation of their origin. A\r\ncertain \"Maister Alexander Galloway\" had apparently strolled with the\r\nhistorian along the sea-coast, the former giving \"his mynd with maist\r\nernist besynes to serche the verite of this obscure and mysty dowtis.\"\r\nLifting up a piece of tangle, they beheld the seaweed to be hanging\r\nfull of mussel-shells from the root to the branches. Maister Galloway\r\nopened one of the mussel-shells, and was \"mair astonis than afore\" to\r\nfind no fish therein, but a perfectly shaped \"foule, smal and gret,\"\r\nas corresponded to the \"quantity of the shell.\" And once again Boece\r\ndraws the inference that the trees or wood on which the creatures are\r\nfound have nothing to do with the origin of the birds; and that the\r\nfowls are begotten of the \"occeane see, quhilk,\" concludes our author,\r\n\"is the caus and production of mony wonderful thingis.\"\r\n\r\nMore than fifty years after the publication of Boece's \"History,\" old\r\nGerard of London, the famous \"master in chirurgerie\" of his day, gave\r\nan account of the barnacle goose, and not only entered into minute\r\nparticulars of its growth and origin, but illustrated its manner of\r\nproduction by means of the engraver's art of his day. Gerard's\r\n\"Herball,\" published in 1597, thus contains, amongst much that is\r\ncurious in medical lore, a very quaint piece of zoölogical history. He\r\ntells us that \"in the north parts of Scotland, and the Hands adjacent,\r\ncalled Orchades (Orkneys),\" are found \"certaine trees, whereon doe\r\ngrowe certaine shell fishes, of a white colour tending to russet;\r\nwherein are conteined little living creatures: which shels in time of\r\nmaturitie doe open, and out of them grow those little living foules\r\nwhom we call Barnakles, in the north of England Brant Geese, and in\r\nLancashire tree Geese; but the other that do fall upon the land,\r\nperish, and come to nothing: thus much by the writings of others, and\r\nalso from the mouths of people of those parts, which may,\" concludes\r\nGerard, \"very well accord with truth.\"\r\n\r\nNot content with hearsay evidence, however, Gerard relates what his\r\neyes saw and hands touched. He describes how on the coasts of a\r\ncertain \"small Hand in Lancashire called Pile of Foulders\" (probably\r\nPeel Island), the wreckage of ships is cast up by the waves, along\r\nwith the trunks and branches \"of old and rotten trees.\" On these\r\nwooden rejectamenta \"a certaine spume or froth\" grows, according to\r\nGerard. This spume \"in time breedeth unto certaine shels, in shape\r\nlike those of the muskle, but sharper pointed, and of a whitish\r\ncolor.\" This description, it may be remarked, clearly applies to the\r\nbarnacles themselves. Gerard then continues to point out how, when the\r\nshell is perfectly formed, it \"gapeth open, and the first thing that\r\nappeereth is the foresaid lace or string\"--the substance described by\r\nGerard as contained within the shell--\"next come the legs of the Birde\r\nhanging out; and as it groweth greater, it openeth the shell by\r\ndegrees, till at length it is all come forth, and hangeth only by the\r\nbill; in short space after it commeth to full maturitie, and falleth\r\ninto the sea, where it gathereth feathers, and groweth to a foule,\r\nbigger than a Mallard, and lesser than a Goose, having blacke legs and\r\nbill or beake, and feathers blacke and white ... which the people of\r\nLancashire call by no other name than a tree Goose.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. THE BARNACLE TREE. (From Gerard's \"Herball.\")]\r\n\r\nAccompanying this description is the engraving of the barnicle tree\r\n(Fig. 1) bearing its geese progeny. From the open shells in two cases,\r\nthe little geese are seen protruding, whilst several of the\r\nfully-fledged fowls are disporting themselves in the sea below.\r\nGerard's concluding piece of information, with its exordium, must not\r\nbe omitted. \"They spawne,\" says the wise apothecary, \"as it were, in\r\nMarch or Aprill; the Geese are found in Maie or June, and come to\r\nfulnesse of feathers in the moneth after. And thus hauing, through\r\nGod's assistance, discoursed somewhat at large of Grasses, Herbes,\r\nShrubs, Trees, Mosses, and certaine excrescences of the earth, with\r\nother things moe incident to the Historic thereof, we conclude and end\r\nour present volume, with this woonder of England. For which God's name\r\nbe euer honored and praised.\" It is to be remarked that Gerard's\r\ndescription of the goose-progeny of the barnacle tree exactly\r\ncorresponds with the appearance of the bird known to ornithologists as\r\nthe \"barnacle-goose\"; and there can be no doubt that, skilled as was\r\nthis author in the natural history lore of his day, there was no other\r\nfeeling in his mind than that of firm belief in and pious wonder at\r\nthe curious relations between the shells and their fowl-offspring.\r\nGerard thus attributes the origin of the latter to the barnacles. He\r\nsays nothing of the \"wormeetin\" holes and burrows so frequently\r\nmentioned by Boece, nor would he have agreed with the latter in\r\ncrediting the \"nature of the occeane see\" with their production, save\r\nin so far as their barnacle-parents lived and existed in the waters of\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nThe last account of this curious fable which we may allude to in the\r\npresent instance is that of Sir Robert Moray, who, in his work\r\nentitled \"A Relation concerning Barnacles,\" published in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal Society in 1677-78, gives a\r\nsuccinct account of these crustaceans and their bird-progeny. Sir\r\nRobert is described as \"lately one of his Majesties Council for the\r\nKingdom of Scotland,\" and we may therefore justly assume his account\r\nto represent that of a cultured, observant person of his day and\r\ngeneration. The account begins by remarking that the \"most ordinary\r\ntrees\" found in the western islands of Scotland \"are Firr and Ash.\"\r\n\"Being,\" continues Sir Robert, \"in the Island of East (Uist), I saw\r\nlying upon the shore a cut of a large Firr tree of about 2-1/2 foot\r\ndiameter, and 9 or 10 foot long; which had lain so long out of the\r\nwater that it was very dry: And most of the shells that had formerly\r\ncover'd it, were worn or rubb'd off. Only on the parts that lay next\r\nthe ground, there still hung multitudes of little Shells; having\r\nwithin them little Birds, perfectly shap'd, supposed to be Barnacles.\"\r\nHere again the description applies to the barnacles; the \"little\r\nbirds\" they are described as containing being of course the bodies of\r\nthe shell-fish.\r\n\r\n\"The Shells,\" continues the narrator, \"hang at the Tree by a Neck\r\nlonger than the Shell;\" this \"neck\" being represented by the stalk of\r\nthe barnacle. The neck is described as being composed \"of a kind of\r\nfilmy substance, round, and hollow, and creased, not unlike the\r\nWind-pipe of a Chicken; spreading out broadest where it is fastened to\r\nthe Tree, from which it seems to draw and convey the matter which\r\nserves for the growth and vegetation of the Shell and the little Bird\r\nwithin it.\" Sir Robert Moray therefore agrees in respect of the manner\r\nof nourishment of the barnacles with the opinion of Giraldus already\r\nquoted. The author goes on to describe the \"Bird\" found in every\r\nshell he opened; remarking that \"there appeared nothing wanting as to\r\nthe internal parts, for making up a perfect Sea-fowl: every little\r\npart appearing so distinctly, that the whole looked like a large Bird\r\nseen through a concave or diminishing Glass, colour and feature being\r\neverywhere so clear and neat.\" The \"Bird\" is most minutely described\r\nas to its bill, eyes, head, neck, breast, wings, tail, and feet, the\r\nfeathers being \"everywhere perfectly shaped, and blackish-coloured.\r\nAll being dead and dry,\" says Sir Robert, \"I did not look after the\r\nInternal parts of them,\" a statement decidedly inconsistent with his\r\nprevious assertion as to the perfect condition of the \"internal\r\nparts\"; and he takes care to add, \"nor did I ever see any of the\r\nlittle Birds alive, nor met with anybody that did. Only some credible\r\npersons,\" he concludes, \"have assured me they have seen some as big as\r\ntheir fist.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. BARNACLE TREE. (From Munster's \"Cosmography.\")]\r\n\r\nThis last writer thus avers that he saw little birds within the shells\r\nhe clearly enough describes as those of the barnacles. We must either\r\ncredit Sir Robert with describing what he never saw, or with\r\nmisconstruing what he did see. His description of the goose\r\ncorresponds with that of the barnacle goose, the reputed progeny of\r\nthe shells; and it would, therefore, seem that this author, with the\r\nmyth at hand, saw the barnacles only with the eyes of a credulous\r\nobserver, and thus beheld, in the inside of each shell--if, indeed,\r\nhis research actually extended thus far--the reproduction in miniature\r\nof a goose, with which, as a mature bird, he was well acquainted.\r\n\r\nOn p. 157 is a woodcut, copied from Munster's \"Cosmography\" (1550), a\r\nvery popular book in its time, showing the tree with its fruit, and\r\nthe geese which are supposed to have just escaped from it.\r\n\r\nThis historical ramble may fitly preface what we have to say regarding\r\nthe probable origin of the myth. By what means could the barnacles\r\nbecome credited with the power of producing the well-known geese? Once\r\nstarted, the progress and growth of the myth are easily accounted for.\r\nThe mere transmission of a fable from one generation or century to\r\nanother is a simply explained circumstance, and one exemplified by the\r\npractices of our own times. The process of accretion and addition is\r\nalso well illustrated in the perpetuation of fables; since the tale is\r\ncertain to lose nothing in its historical journey, but, on the\r\ncontrary, to receive additional elaboration with increasing age.\r\nProfessor Max Müller, after discussing various theories of the origin\r\nof the barnacle myth, declares in favor of the idea that confusion of\r\nlanguage and alteration of names lie at the root of the error. The\r\nlearned author of the \"Science of Language\" argues that the true\r\nbarnacles were named, properly enough, Bernaculae, and lays stress on\r\nthe fact that Bernicle geese were first caught in Ireland. That\r\ncountry becomes _Hibernia_ in Latin, and the Irish geese were\r\naccordingly named Hibernicae, or Hiberniculae. By the omission of the\r\nfirst syllable--no uncommon operation for words to undergo--we obtain\r\nthe name Berniculae for the geese, this term being almost synonymous\r\nwith the name Bernaculae already applied, as we have seen, to the\r\nbarnacles. Bernicle geese and bernicle shells, confused in name, thus\r\nbecame confused in nature; and, once started, the ordinary process of\r\ngrowth was sufficient to further intensify, and render more realistic,\r\nthe story of the bernicle tree and its wonderful progeny.\r\n\r\nBy way of a companion legend to that of the barnacle tree, we may\r\nselect the story of the \"Lamb Tree\" of Cathay, told by Sir John\r\nMandeville, whose notes of travel regarding crocodiles' tears, and\r\nother points in the conformation of these reptiles, have already been\r\nreferred to. Sir John, in that chapter of his work which treats \"Of\r\nthe Contries and Yles that ben bezonde the Lond of Cathay; and of the\r\nFrutes there,\" etc., relates that in Cathay \"there growethe a manner\r\nof Fruyt, as thoughe it were Gowrdes: and whan thei ben rype, men\r\nkutten (cut) hem a to (them in two), and men fyndem with inne a\r\nlytylle Best (beast), in Flessche in Bon and Blode (bone and blood) as\r\nthough it were a lytylle Lomb (lamb) with outen wolle (without wool).\r\nAnd men eaten both the Frut and the Best; and that,\" says Sir John,\r\n\"is a great marveylle. Of that frut,\" he continues, \"I have eten; alle\r\nthoughe it were wondirfulle\"--this being added, no doubt, from an\r\nidea that there might possibly be some stay-at-home persons who would\r\ntake Sir John's statement _cum grano salis_. \"But,\" adds this worthy\r\n\"knyght of Ingolond,\" \"I knowe wel that God is marveyllous in His\r\nWerkes.\" Not to be behind the inhabitants of Cathay in a tale of\r\nwonders, the knight related to these Easterns \"als gret a marveylle to\r\nhem that is amonges us; and that was of the Bernakes. For I tolde him\r\nhat in oure Countree weren Trees that beren a Fruyt, that becomen\r\nBriddes (birds) fleeynge: and tho that fellen in the Water lyven\r\n(live); and thei that fallen on the Erthe dyen anon: and thei ben\r\nright gode to mannes mete (man's meat). And here had thei als gret\r\nmarvayle,\" concludes Sir John, \"that sume of hem trowed it were an\r\nimpossible thing to be.\" Probably the inhabitants of Cathay, knowing\r\ntheir own weakness as regards the lamb tree, might possess a\r\nfellow-feeling for their visitor's credulity, knowing well, from\r\nexperience, the readiness with which a \"gret marvayle\" could be\r\nevolved and sustained.\r\n\r\nPassing from the sphere of the mythical and marvellous as represented\r\nin mediaeval times, we may shortly discuss a question, which, of all\r\nothers, may justly claim a place in the records of zoölogical\r\ncuriosities--namely, the famous and oft-repeated story of the \"Toad\r\nfrom the solid rock,\" as the country newspapers style the incident.\r\nRegularly, year by year, and in company with the reports of the\r\nsea-serpent's reappearance, we may read of the discoveries of toads\r\nand frogs in situations and under circumstances suggestive of a\r\nsingular vitality on the part of the amphibians, of more than usual\r\ncredulity on the part of the hearers, or of a large share of\r\ninventive genius in the narrators of such tales. The question\r\npossesses for every one a certain degree of interest, evoked by the\r\ncurious and strange features presented on the face of the tales. And\r\nit may therefore not only prove an interesting but also a useful\r\nstudy, if we endeavor to arrive at some just and logical conceptions\r\nof these wonderful narrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nInstances of the discovery of toads and frogs in solid rocks need not\r\nbe specially given; suffice it to say, that these narratives are\r\nrepeated year by year with little variation. A large block of stone or\r\nface of rock is detached from its site, and a toad or frog is seen\r\nhereafter to be hopping about in its usual lively manner. The\r\nconclusion to which the bystanders invariably come is that the animal\r\nmust have been contained within the rock, and that it was liberated by\r\nthe dislodgement of the mass. Now, in many instances, cases of the\r\nappearance of toads during quarrying operations have been found, on\r\nclose examination, to present no evidence whatever that the appearance\r\nof the animals was due to the dislodgement of the stones. A frog or\r\ntoad may be found hopping about among some recently formed débris, and\r\nthe animal is at once seized upon and reported as having emerged from\r\nthe rocks into the light of day. There is in such a case not the\r\nslightest ground for supposing any such thing; and the animal may more\r\nreasonably be presumed to have simply hopped into the débris from its\r\nordinary habitat. But laying aside narratives of this kind, which lose\r\ntheir plausibility under a very commonplace scrutiny, there still\r\nexist cases, reported in an apparently exact and truthful manner, in\r\nwhich these animals have been alleged to appear from the inner\r\ncrevices of rocks after the removal of large masses of the formations.\r\nWe shall assume these latter tales to contain a plain, unvarnished\r\nstatement of what was observed, and deal with the evidence they\r\npresent on this footing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A TOAD.]\r\n\r\nOne or two notable examples of such verified tales are related by\r\nSmellie, in his \"Philosophy of Natural History.\" Thus, in the \"Memoirs\r\nof the French Academy of Sciences\" for 1719, a toad is described as\r\nhaving been found in the heart of an elm tree; and another is stated\r\nto have been found in the heart of an old oak tree, in 1731, near\r\nNantz. The condition of the trees is not expressly stated, nor are we\r\nafforded any information regarding the appearance of the\r\ntoads--particulars of considerable importance in view of the\r\nsuggestions and explanations to be presently brought forward. Smellie\r\nhimself, while inclined to be sceptical in regard to the truth or\r\nexactness of many of the tales told of the vitality of toads, regards\r\nthe matter as affording food for reflection, since he remarks, \"But I\r\nmean not to persuade, for I cannot satisfy myself; all I intend is, to\r\nrecommend to those gentlemen who may hereafter chance to see such rare\r\nphenomena, a strict examination of every circumstance that can throw\r\nlight upon a subject so dark and mysterious; for the vulgar, ever\r\ninclined to render uncommon appearances still more marvellous, are not\r\nto be trusted.\"\r\n\r\nThis author strikes the key-note of the inquiry in his concluding\r\nwords, and we shall find that the explanation of the matter really\r\nlies in the clear understanding of what are the probabilities, and\r\nwhat the actual details, of the cases presented for consideration. We\r\nmay firstly, then, glance at a few of the peculiarities of the frogs\r\nand toads, regarded from a zoölogical point of view. As every one\r\nknows, these animals emerge from the egg in the form of little\r\nfish-like \"tadpoles,\" provided with outside gills, which are soon\r\nreplaced by inside gills, resembling those of fishes. The hind legs\r\nare next developed, and the fore limbs follow a little later; whilst,\r\nwith the development of lungs, and the disappearance of the gills and\r\ntail, the animal leaves the water, and remains for the rest of its\r\nlife an air-breathing, terrestrial animal. Then, secondly, in the\r\nadult frog or toad, the naturalist would point to the importance of\r\nthe skin as not only supplementing, but, in some cases, actually\r\nsupplanting the work of the lungs as the breathing organ. Frogs and\r\ntoads will live for months under water, and will survive the excision\r\nof the lungs for like periods; the skin in such cases serving as the\r\nbreathing surface. A third point worthy of remembrance is included in\r\nthe facts just related, and is implied in the information that these\r\nanimals can exist for long periods without food, and with but a\r\nlimited supply of air. We can understand this toleration on the part\r\nof these animals when we take into consideration their cold-blooded\r\nhabits, which do not necessitate, and which are not accompanied by,\r\nthe amount of vital activity we are accustomed to note in higher\r\nanimals. And, as a last feature in the purely scientific history of\r\nthe frogs and toads, it may be remarked that these animals are known\r\nto live for long periods. One pet toad is mentioned by a Mr. Arscott\r\nas having attained, to his knowledge, the age of thirty-six years; and\r\na greater age still might have been recorded of this specimen, but for\r\nthe untoward treatment it sustained at the hands, or rather beak, of a\r\ntame raven. In all probability it may be safely assumed that, when the\r\nconditions of life are favorable, these creatures may attain a highly\r\nvenerable age--regarding the lapse of time from a purely human and\r\ninterested point of view.\r\n\r\nWe may now inquire whether or not the foregoing considerations may\r\nserve to throw any light upon the tales of the quarryman. The first\r\npoint to which attention may be directed is that involved in the\r\nstatement that the amphibian has been imprisoned in a _solid_ rock.\r\nMuch stress is usually laid on the fact that the rock was solid; this\r\nfact being held to imply the great age, not to say antiquity, of the\r\nrock and its supposed tenant. The impartial observer, after an\r\nexamination of the evidence presented, will be inclined to doubt\r\ngreatly the justification for inserting the adjective \"solid\"; for\r\nusually no evidence whatever is forthcoming as to the state of the\r\nrock prior to its removal. No previous examination of the rock is or\r\ncan be made, from the circumstance that no interest can possibly\r\nattach to its condition until its removal reveals the apparent wonder\r\nit contained, in the shape of the live toad. And it is equally\r\nimportant to note that we rarely, if ever, find mention of any\r\nexamination of the rock being made subsequently to the discovery.\r\nHence, a first and grave objection may be taken to the validity of the\r\nsupposition that the rock was solid, and it may be fairly urged that\r\non this supposition the whole question turns and depends. For if the\r\nrock cannot be proved to have been impermeable to and barred against\r\nthe entrance of living creatures, the objector may proceed to show the\r\npossibility of the toad having gained admission, under certain notable\r\ncircumstances, to its prison-house.\r\n\r\nThe frog or toad in its young state, and having just entered upon its\r\nterrestrial life, is a small creature, which could, with the utmost\r\nease, wriggle into crevices and crannies of a size which would almost\r\npreclude such apertures being noticed at all. Gaining access to a\r\nroomier crevice or nook within, and finding there a due supply of air,\r\nalong with a dietary consisting chiefly of insects, the animal would\r\ngrow with tolerable rapidity, and would increase to such an extent\r\nthat egress through its aperture of entrance would become an\r\nimpossibility. Next, let us suppose that the toleration of the toad's\r\nsystem to starvation and to a limited supply of air is taken into\r\naccount, together with the fact that these creatures will hibernate\r\nduring each winter, and thus economize, as it were, their vital\r\nactivity and strength; and after the animal has thus existed for a\r\nyear or two--no doubt under singularly hard conditions--let us imagine\r\nthat the rock is split up by the wedge and lever of the excavator. We\r\ncan then readily enough account for the apparently inexplicable story\r\nof \"the toad in the rock.\" \"There is the toad and here is the solid\r\nrock,\" say the gossips. \"There is an animal which has singular powers\r\nof sustaining life under untoward conditions, and which, in its young\r\nstate, could have gained admittance to the rock through a mere\r\ncrevice,\" says the naturalist in reply. Doubtless, the great army of\r\nthe unconvinced may still believe in the tale as told them; for the\r\nweighing of evidence and the placing _pros_ and _cons_ in fair\r\ncontrast are not tasks of congenial or wonted kind in the ordinary run\r\nof life. Some people there will be who will believe in the original\r\nsolid rock and its toad, despite the assertion of the geologists that\r\nthe earliest fossils of toads appear in almost the last-formed rocks,\r\nand that a live toad in rocks of very ancient age--presuming,\r\naccording to the popular belief, that the animal was enclosed when the\r\nrock was formed--would be as great an anomaly and wonder as the\r\nmention, as an historical fact, of an express train or the telegraph\r\nin the days of the patriarchs. In other words, the live toad which\r\nhops out of an Old Red Sandstone rock must be presumed, on the popular\r\nbelief, to be older by untold ages than the oldest fossil frogs and\r\ntoads. The reasonable mind, however, will ponder and consider each\r\nfeature of the case, and will rather prefer to countenance a\r\nsupposition based on ordinary experience, than an explanation brought\r\nready-made from the domain of the miraculous; whilst not the least\r\nnoteworthy feature of these cases is that included in the remark of\r\nSmellie, respecting the tendency of uneducated and superstitious\r\npersons to magnify what is uncommon, and in his sage conclusion that\r\nas a rule such persons in the matter of their relations \"are not to be\r\ntrusted.\"\r\n\r\nBut it must also be noted that we possess valuable evidence of a\r\npositive and direct kind bearing on the duration of life in toads\r\nunder adverse circumstances. As this evidence tells most powerfully\r\nagainst the supposition that the existence of those creatures can be\r\nindefinitely prolonged, it forms of itself a veritable court of appeal\r\nin the cases under discussion. The late Dr. Buckland, curious to learn\r\nthe exact extent of the vitality of the toad, caused, in the year\r\n1825, two large blocks of stone to be prepared. One of the blocks was\r\ntaken from the oölite limestone, and in this first stone twelve cells\r\nwere excavated. Each cell was one foot deep and five inches in\r\ndiameter. The mouth of each cell was grooved so as to admit of two\r\ncovers being placed over the aperture; the first or lower cover being\r\nof glass, and the upper one of slate. Both covers were so adapted that\r\nthey could be firmly luted down with clay or putty; the object of this\r\ndouble protection being that the slate cover could be raised so as to\r\ninspect the contained object through the closed glass cover without\r\nadmitting air. In the second or sandstone block, a series of twelve\r\ncells was also excavated; these latter cells being, however, of\r\nsmaller size than those of the limestone block, each cell being only\r\nsix inches in depth by five inches in diameter. These cells were\r\nlikewise fitted with double covers.\r\n\r\nOn November 26th, 1825, a live toad--kept for some time previously to\r\ninsure its being healthy--was placed in each of the twenty-four cells.\r\nThe largest specimen weighed 1185 grains, and the smallest 115 grains.\r\nThe stones and the immured toads were buried on the day mentioned,\r\nthree feet deep, in Dr. Buckland's garden. There they lay until\r\nDecember 10th, 1826, when they were disinterred and their tenants\r\nexamined. All the toads in the smaller cells of the sandstone block\r\nwere dead, and from the progress of decomposition it was inferred that\r\nthey had succumbed long before the date of disinterment. The majority\r\nof the toads in the limestone block were alive, and, curiously enough,\r\none or two had actually increased in weight. Thus, No. 5, which at the\r\ncommencement of its captivity had weighed 1185 grains, had increased\r\nto 1265 grains; but the glass cover of No. 5's cell was found to be\r\ncracked. Insects and air must therefore have obtained admittance and\r\nhave afforded nourishment to the imprisoned toad; this supposition\r\nbeing rendered the more likely by the discovery that in one of the\r\ncells, the covers of which were also cracked and the tenant of which\r\nwas dead, numerous insects were found. No. 9, weighing originally 988\r\ngrains, had increased during its incarceration to 1116 grains; but\r\nNo. 1, which in the year 1825 had weighed 924 grains, was found in\r\nDecember, 1826, to have decreased to 698 grains; and No. 11,\r\noriginally weighing 936 grains, had likewise disagreed with the\r\nimprisonment, weighing only 652 grains when examined in 1826.\r\n\r\nAt the period when the blocks of stone were thus prepared, four toads\r\nwere pinned up in holes five inches deep and three inches in diameter,\r\ncut in the stem of an apple-tree; the holes being firmly plugged with\r\ntightly fitting wooden plugs. These four toads were found to be dead\r\nwhen examined along with the others in 1826; and of four others\r\nenclosed in basins made of plaster of Paris, and which were also\r\nburied in Dr. Buckland's garden, two were found to be dead at the end\r\nof a year, their comrades being alive, but looking starved and meagre.\r\nThe toads which were found alive in the limestone block in December,\r\n1826, were again immured and buried, but were found to be dead,\r\nwithout leaving a single survivor, at the end of the second year of\r\ntheir imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThese experiments may fairly be said to prove two points. They firstly\r\nshow that under circumstances even of a favorable kind when compared\r\nwith the condition popularly believed in--namely, that of being\r\nenclosed in a _solid_ rock--the limit of the toad's life may be\r\nassumed to be within two years; this period being no doubt capable of\r\nbeing extended when the animal gains a slight advantage, exemplified\r\nby the admission of air and insect-food. Secondly, we may reasonably\r\nargue that these experiments show that toads when rigorously treated,\r\nlike other animals, become starved and meagre, and by no means\r\nresemble the lively, well-fed animals reported as having emerged from\r\nan imprisonment extending, in popular estimation, through periods of\r\ninconceivable duration.\r\n\r\nThese tales are, in short, as devoid of actual foundation as are the\r\nmodern beliefs in the venomous properties of the toad, or the ancient\r\nbeliefs in the occult and mystic powers of various parts of its frame\r\nwhen used in incantations. Shakespeare, whilst attributing to the toad\r\nvenomous qualities, has yet immortalized it in his famous simile by\r\ncrediting it with the possession of a \"precious jewel.\" But even in\r\nthe latter case the animal gets but scant justice; for science strips\r\nit of its poetical reputation, and in this, as in other respects,\r\nshows it, despite fable and myth, to be zoölogically an interesting,\r\nbut otherwise a commonplace member of the animal series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON A PIECE OF CHALK\r\n\r\n_A LECTURE TO WORKING MEN_.\r\n\r\n(Delivered in England.)\r\n\r\nBY T.H. HUXLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A CHALK CLIFF.]\r\n\r\nIf a well were to be sunk at our feet in the midst of the city of\r\nNorwich, the diggers would very soon find themselves at work in that\r\nwhite substance almost too soft to be called rock, with which we are\r\nall familiar as \"chalk.\"\r\n\r\nNot only here, but over the whole county of Norfolk, the well-sinker\r\nmight carry his shaft down many hundred feet without coming to the end\r\nof the chalk; and, on the sea-coast, where the waves have pared away\r\nthe face of the land which breasts them, the scarped faces of the high\r\ncliffs are often wholly formed of the same material. Northward, the\r\nchalk may be followed as far as Yorkshire; on the south coast it\r\nappears abruptly in the picturesque western bays of Dorset, and breaks\r\ninto the Needles of the Isle of Wight; while on the shores of Kent it\r\nsupplies that long line of white cliffs to which England owes her name\r\nof Albion.\r\n\r\nWere the thin soil which covers it all washed away, a curved band of\r\nwhite chalk, here broader, and there narrower, might be followed\r\ndiagonally across England from Lulworth in Dorset, to Flamborough Head\r\nin Yorkshire--a distance of over two hundred and eighty miles as the\r\ncrow flies.\r\n\r\nFrom this band to the North Sea, on the east, and the Channel, on the\r\nsouth, the chalk is largely hidden by other deposits; but, except in\r\nthe Weald of Kent and Sussex, it enters into the very foundation of\r\nall the south-eastern counties.\r\n\r\nAttaining, as it does in some places, a thickness of more than a\r\nthousand feet, the English chalk must be admitted to be a mass of\r\nconsiderable magnitude. Nevertheless, it covers but an insignificant\r\nportion of the whole area occupied by the chalk formation of the\r\nglobe, which has precisely the same general character as ours, and is\r\nfound in detached patches, some less, and others more extensive, than\r\nthe English.\r\n\r\nChalk occurs in north-west Ireland; it stretches over a large part of\r\nFrance--the chalk which underlies Paris being, in fact, a continuation\r\nof that of the London basin; it runs through Denmark and Central\r\nEurope, and extends southward to North Africa; while eastward, it\r\nappears in the Crimea and in Syria, and may be traced as far as the\r\nshores of the Sea of Aral, in Central Asia.\r\n\r\nIf all the points at which true chalk occurs were circumscribed, they\r\nwould lie within an irregular oval about three thousand miles in long\r\ndiameter--the area of which would be as great as that of Europe, and\r\nwould many times exceed that of the largest existing inland sea--the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nThus the chalk is no unimportant element in the masonry of the earth's\r\ncrust, and it impresses a peculiar stamp, varying with the conditions\r\nto which it is exposed, on the scenery of the districts in which it\r\noccurs. The undulating downs and rounded coombs, covered with\r\nsweet-grassed turf, of our inland chalk country, have a peacefully\r\ndomestic and mutton-suggesting prettiness, but can hardly be called\r\neither grand or beautiful. But on our southern coasts, the wall-sided\r\ncliffs, many hundred feet high, with vast needles and pinnacles\r\nstanding out in the sea, sharp and solitary enough to serve as perches\r\nfor the wary cormorant, confer a wonderful beauty and grandeur upon\r\nthe chalk headlands. And in the East, chalk has its share in the\r\nformation of some of the most venerable of mountain ranges, such as\r\nthe Lebanon.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat is this wide-spread component of the surface of the earth? and\r\nwhence did it come?\r\n\r\nYou may think this no very hopeful inquiry. You may not unnaturally\r\nsuppose that the attempt to solve such problems as these can lead to\r\nno result, save that of entangling the inquirer in vague speculations,\r\nincapable of refutation and of verification.\r\n\r\nIf such were really the case, I should have selected some other\r\nsubject than a \"piece of chalk\" for my discourse. But, in truth,\r\nafter much deliberation, I have been unable to think of any topic\r\nwhich would so well enable me to lead you to see how solid is the\r\nfoundation upon which some of the most startling conclusions of\r\nphysical science rest.\r\n\r\nA great chapter of the history of the world is written in the chalk.\r\nFew passages in the history of man can be supported by such an\r\noverwhelming mass of direct and indirect evidence as that which\r\ntestifies to the truth of the fragment of the history of the globe,\r\nwhich I hope to enable you to read, with your own eyes, to-night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MICROSCOPIC SECTION OF CHALK.\r\n\r\n(Magnified nearly 300 times.)\r\n\r\n1. Textularia. 2. Globigerina. 3. Rotalia. 4. Coccoliths.]\r\n\r\nLet me add, that few chapters of human history have a more profound\r\nsignificance for ourselves. I weigh my words well when I assert, that\r\nthe man who should know the true history of the bit of chalk which\r\nevery carpenter carries about in his breeches' pocket, though ignorant\r\nof all other history, is likely, if he will think his knowledge out to\r\nits ultimate results, to have a truer, and therefore a better,\r\nconception of this wonderful universe, and of man's relation to it,\r\nthan the most learned student who is deep-read in the records of\r\nhumanity and ignorant of those of nature.\r\n\r\nThe language of the chalk is not hard to learn, not nearly so hard as\r\nLatin, if you only want to get at the broad features of the story it\r\nhas to tell; and I propose that we now set to work to spell that story\r\nout together.\r\n\r\nWe all know that if we \"burn\" chalk, the result is quicklime. Chalk,\r\nin fact, is a compound of carbonic acid gas and lime; and when you\r\nmake it very hot, the carbonic acid flies away and the lime is left.\r\n\r\nBy this method of procedure we see the lime, but we do not see the\r\ncarbonic acid. If, on the other hand, you were to powder a little\r\nchalk and drop it into a good deal of strong vinegar, there would be a\r\ngreat bubbling and fizzing, and, finally, a clear liquid, in which no\r\nsign of chalk would appear. Here you see the carbonic acid in the\r\nbubbles; the lime, dissolved in the vinegar, vanishes from sight.\r\nThere are a great many other ways of showing that chalk is essentially\r\nnothing but carbonic acid and quicklime. Chemists enunciate the result\r\nof all the experiments which prove this, by stating that chalk is\r\nalmost wholly composed of \"carbonate of lime.\"\r\n\r\nIt is desirable for us to start from the knowledge of this fact,\r\nthough it may not seem to help us very far toward what we seek. For\r\ncarbonate of lime is a widely-spread substance, and is met with under\r\nvery various conditions. All sorts of limestones are composed of more\r\nor less pure carbonate of lime. The crust which is often deposited by\r\nwaters which have drained through limestone rocks, in the form of what\r\nare called stalagmites and stalactites, is carbonate of lime. Or, to\r\ntake a more familiar example, the fur on the inside of a tea-kettle is\r\ncarbonate of lime; and, for anything chemistry tells us to the\r\ncontrary, the chalk might be a kind of gigantic fur upon the bottom of\r\nthe earth-kettle, which is kept pretty hot below.\r\n\r\nLet us try another method of making the chalk tell us its own history.\r\nTo the unassisted eye chalk looks simply like a very loose and open\r\nkind of stone. But it is possible to grind a slice of chalk down so\r\nthin that you can see through it--until it is thin enough, in fact, to\r\nbe examined with any magnifying power that may be thought desirable. A\r\nthin slice of the fur of a kettle might be made in the same way. If it\r\nwere examined microscopically, it would show itself to be a more or\r\nless distinctly laminated mineral substance, and nothing more.\r\n\r\nBut the slice of chalk presents a totally different appearance when\r\nplaced under the microscope. The general mass of it is made up of very\r\nminute granules; but, imbedded in this matrix, are innumerable bodies,\r\nsome smaller and some larger, but, on a rough average, not more than a\r\nhundredth of an inch in diameter, having a well-defined shape and\r\nstructure. A cubic inch of some specimens of chalk may contain\r\nhundreds of thousands of these bodies, compacted together with\r\nincalculable millions of the granules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHALK.\r\n\r\n(Magnified nearly 100 diameters.)]\r\n\r\nThe examination of a transparent slice gives a good notion of the\r\nmanner in which the components of the chalk are arranged, and of\r\ntheir relative proportions. But, by rubbing up some chalk with a brush\r\nin water and then pouring off the milky fluid, so as to obtain\r\nsediments of different degrees of fineness, the granules and the\r\nminute rounded bodies may be pretty well separated from one another,\r\nand submitted to microscopic examination, either as opaque or as\r\ntransparent objects. By combining the views obtained in these various\r\nmethods, each of the rounded bodies may be proved to be a\r\nbeautifully-constructed calcareous fabric, made up of a number of\r\nchambers, communicating freely with one another. The chambered bodies\r\nare of various forms. One of the commonest is something like a\r\nbadly-grown raspberry, being formed of a number of nearly globular\r\nchambers of different sizes congregated together. It is called\r\nGlobigerina, and some specimens of chalk consist of little else than\r\nGlobigerinæ and granules.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLOBIGERINA.]\r\n\r\nLet us fix our attention upon the Globigerina. It is the spoor of the\r\ngame we are tracking. If we can learn what it is and what are the\r\nconditions of its existence, we shall see our way to the origin and\r\npast history of the chalk.\r\n\r\nA suggestion which may naturally enough present itself is, that these\r\ncurious bodies are the result of some process of aggregation which has\r\ntaken place in the carbonate of lime; that, just as in winter, the\r\nrime on our windows simulates the most delicate and elegantly\r\narborescent foliage--proving that the mere mineral matter may, under\r\ncertain conditions, assume the outward form of organic bodies--so this\r\nmineral substance, carbonate of lime, hidden away in the bowels of\r\nthe earth, has taken the shape of these chambered bodies. I am not\r\nraising a merely fanciful and unreal objection. Very learned men, in\r\nformer days, have even entertained the notion that all the formed\r\nthings found in rocks are of this nature; and if no such conception is\r\nat present held to be admissible, it is because long and varied\r\nexperience has now shown that mineral matter never does assume the\r\nform and structure we find in fossils. If anyone were to try to\r\npersuade you that an oyster-shell (which is also chiefly composed of\r\ncarbonate of lime) had crystallized out of sea-water, I suppose you\r\nwould laugh at the absurdity. Your laughter would be justified by the\r\nfact that all experience tends to show that oyster-shells are formed\r\nby the agency of oysters, and in no other way. And if there were no\r\nbetter reasons, we should be justified, on like grounds, in believing\r\nthat Globigerina is not the product of anything but vital activity.\r\n\r\nHappily, however, better evidence in proof of the organic nature of\r\nthe Globigerinæ than that of analogy is forthcoming. It so happens\r\nthat calcareous skeletons, exactly similar to the Globigerinæ of the\r\nchalk, are being formed, at the present moment, by minute living\r\ncreatures, which flourish in multitudes, literally more numerous than\r\nthe sands of the sea-shore, over a large extent of that part of the\r\nearth's surface which is covered by the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe history of the discovery of these living Globigerinæ, and of the\r\npart which they play in rock-building, is singular enough. It is a\r\ndiscovery which, like others of no less scientific importance, has\r\narisen, incidentally, out of work devoted to very different and\r\nexceedingly practical interests.\r\n\r\nWhen men first took to the sea, they speedily learned to look out for\r\nshoals and rocks; and the more the burthen of their ships increased,\r\nthe more imperatively necessary it became for sailors to ascertain\r\nwith precision the depth of the waters they traversed. Out of this\r\nnecessity grew the use of the lead and sounding-line; and, ultimately,\r\nmarine-surveying, which is the recording of the form of coasts and of\r\nthe depth of the sea, as ascertained by the sounding-lead, upon\r\ncharts.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, it became desirable to ascertain and to indicate the\r\nnature of the sea-bottom, since this circumstance greatly affects its\r\ngoodness as holding ground for anchors. Some ingenious tar, whose name\r\ndeserves a better fate than the oblivion into which it has fallen,\r\nattained this object by \"arming\" the bottom of the lead with a lump of\r\ngrease, to which more or less of the sand or mud, or broken shells, as\r\nthe case might be, adhered, and was brought to the surface. But,\r\nhowever well adapted such an apparatus might be for rough nautical\r\npurposes, scientific accuracy could not be expected from the armed\r\nlead, and to remedy its defects (especially when applied to sounding\r\nin great depths) Lieutenant Brooke, of the American Navy, some years\r\nago invented a most ingenious machine, by which a considerable portion\r\nof the superficial layer of the sea-bottom can be scooped out and\r\nbrought up, from any depth to which the lead descends.\r\n\r\nIn 1853, Lieutenant Brooke obtained mud from the bottom of the North\r\nAtlantic, between Newfoundland and the Azores, at a depth of more than\r\nten thousand feet, or two miles, by the help of this sounding\r\napparatus. The specimens were sent for examination to Ehrenberg of\r\nBerlin, and to Bailey of West Point, and those able microscopists\r\nfound that this deep-sea mud was almost entirely composed of the\r\nskeletons of living organisms--the greater proportion of these being\r\njust like the Globigerinæ already known to occur in chalk.\r\n\r\nThus far, the work had been carried on simply in the interests of\r\nscience, but Lieutenant Brooke's method of sounding acquired a high\r\ncommercial value, when the enterprise of laying down the\r\ntelegraph-cable between this country and the United States was\r\nundertaken. For it became a matter of immense importance to know, not\r\nonly the depth of the sea over the whole line, along which the cable\r\nwas to be laid, but the exact nature of the bottom, so as to guard\r\nagainst chances of cutting or fraying the strands of that costly rope.\r\nThe Admiralty consequently ordered Captain Dayman, an old friend and\r\nshipmate of mine, to ascertain the depth over the whole line of the\r\ncable, and to bring back specimens of the bottom. In former days, such\r\na command as this might have sounded very much like one of the\r\nimpossible things which the young prince in the Fairy Tales is ordered\r\nto do before he can obtain the hand of the princess. However, in the\r\nmonths of June and July, 1857, my friend performed the task assigned\r\nto him with great expedition and precision, without, so far as I know,\r\nhaving met with any reward of that kind. The specimens of Atlantic mud\r\nwhich he procured were sent to me to be examined and reported upon.\r\n\r\nThe result of all these operations is, that we know the contours and\r\nthe nature of the surface-soil covered by the North Atlantic, for a\r\ndistance of seventeen hundred miles from east to west, as well as we\r\nknow that of any part of the dry land.\r\n\r\nIt is a prodigious plain--one of the widest and most even plains in\r\nthe world. If the sea were drained off, you might drive a wagon all\r\nthe way from Valentia, on the west coast of Ireland, to Trinity Bay in\r\nNewfoundland. And, except upon one sharp incline about two hundred\r\nmiles from Valentia, I am not quite sure that it would even be\r\nnecessary to put the skid on, so gentle are the ascents and descents\r\nupon that long route. From Valentia the road would lie down-hill for\r\nabout two hundred miles to the point at which the bottom is now\r\ncovered by seventeen hundred fathoms of sea-water. Then would come the\r\ncentral plain, more than a thousand miles wide, the inequalities of\r\nthe surface of which would be hardly perceptible, though the depth of\r\nwater upon it now varies from ten thousand to fifteen thousand feet;\r\nand there are places in which Mont Blanc might be sunk without showing\r\nits peak above water. Beyond this, the ascent on the American side\r\ncommences, and gradually leads, for about three hundred miles, to the\r\nNewfoundland shore.\r\n\r\nAlmost the whole of the bottom of this central plain (which extends\r\nfor many hundred miles in a north and south direction) is covered by a\r\nfine mud, which, when brought to the surface, dries into a grayish\r\nwhite friable substance. You can write with this on a black-board, if\r\nyou are so inclined; and, to the eye, it is quite like very soft,\r\ngrayish chalk. Examined chemically, it proves to be composed almost\r\nwholly of carbonate of lime; and if you make a section of it, in the\r\nsame way as that of the piece of chalk was made, and view it with the\r\nmicroscope, it presents innumerable Globigerinæ embedded in a granular\r\nmatrix.\r\n\r\nThus this deep-sea mud is substantially chalk. I say substantially,\r\nbecause there are a good many minor differences; but as these have no\r\nbearing on the question immediately before us--which is the nature of\r\nthe Globigerinæ of the chalk--it is unnecessary to speak of them.\r\n\r\nGlobigerinæ of every size, from the smallest to the largest, are\r\nassociated together in the Atlantic mud, and the chambers of many are\r\nfilled by a soft animal matter. This soft substance is, in fact, the\r\nremains of the creature to which the Globigerina shell, or rather\r\nskeleton, owes its existence--and which is an animal of the simplest\r\nimaginable description. It is, in fact, a mere particle of living\r\njelly, without defined parts of any kind--without a mouth, nerves,\r\nmuscles, or distinct organs, and only manifesting its vitality to\r\nordinary observation by thrusting out and retracting from all parts of\r\nits surface long filamentous processes, which serve for arms and legs.\r\nYet this amorphous particle, devoid of everything which, in the higher\r\nanimals, we call organs, is capable of feeding, growing, and\r\nmultiplying; of separating from the ocean the small proportion of\r\ncarbonate of lime which is dissolved in sea-water; and of building up\r\nthat substance into a skeleton for itself, according to a pattern\r\nwhich can be imitated by no other known agency.\r\n\r\nThe notion that animals can live and flourish in the sea, at the vast\r\ndepths from which apparently living Giobigerinæ have been brought up,\r\ndoes not agree very well with our usual conceptions respecting the\r\nconditions of animal life; and it is not so absolutely impossible as\r\nit might at first sight appear to be, that the Globigerinæ of the\r\nAtlantic sea-bottom do not live and die where they are found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIATOM OOZE DREDGED FROM A DEPTH OF 1950 FEET.\r\n\r\n(Magnified nearly 300 diameters.)]\r\n\r\nAs I have mentioned, the soundings from the great Atlantic plain are\r\nalmost entirely made up of Globigerinæ, with the granules which have\r\nbeen mentioned, and some few other calcareous shells; but a small\r\npercentage of the chalky mud--perhaps at most some five per cent of\r\nit--is of a different nature, and consists of shells and skeletons\r\ncomposed of silex, or pure flint. These siliceous bodies belong partly\r\nto the lowly vegetable organisms which are called Diatomaceæ, and\r\npartly to the minute and extremely simple animals, termed Radiolaria.\r\nIt is quite certain that these creatures do not live at the bottom of\r\nthe ocean, but at its surface--where they may be obtained in\r\nprodigious numbers by the use of a properly constructed net. Hence it\r\nfollows that these siliceous organisms, though they are not heavier\r\nthan the lightest dust, must have fallen, in some cases, through\r\nfifteen thousand feet of water, before they reached their final\r\nresting-place on the ocean floor. And, considering how large a\r\nsurface these bodies expose in proportion to their weight, it is\r\nprobable that they occupy a great length of time in making their\r\nburial journey from the surface of the Atlantic to the bottom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RADIOLARIA. (_a._ Natural size. _b._ One-third natural\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\nBut if the Radiolaria and Diatoms are thus rained upon the bottom of\r\nthe sea, from the superficial layer of its waters in which they pass\r\ntheir lives, it is obviously possible that the Globigerinæ may be\r\nsimilarly derived; and if they were so, it would be much more easy to\r\nunderstand how they obtain their supply of food than it is at present.\r\nNevertheless, the positive and negative evidence all points the other\r\nway. The skeletons of the full-grown, deep-sea Globigerinæ are so\r\nremarkably solid and heavy in proportion to their surface as to seem\r\nlittle fitted for floating; and, as a matter of fact, they are not to\r\nbe found along with the Diatoms and Radiolaria, in the uppermost\r\nstratum of the open ocean.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, again, that the abundance of Globigerinæ, in\r\nproportion to other organisms of like kind, increases with the depth\r\nof the sea; and that deep-water Globigerinæ are larger than those\r\nwhich live in the shallower parts of the sea; and such facts negative\r\nthe supposition that these organisms have been swept by currents from\r\nthe shallows into the deeps of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nIt therefore seems to be hardly doubtful that these wonderful\r\ncreatures live and die at the depths in which they are found.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: During the cruise of H.M.S. Bull-dog, commanded by Sir\r\nLeopold M'Clintock, in 1860, living star-fish were brought up,\r\nclinging to the lowest part of the sounding-line, from a depth of 1260\r\nfathoms, midway between Cape Farewell, in Greenland, and the Rockall\r\nbanks. Dr. Wallich ascertained that the sea-bottom at this point\r\nconsisted of the ordinary Globigerina ooze, and that the stomachs of\r\nthe star-fishes were full of Globigerinæ. This discovery removes all\r\nobjections to the existence of living Globigerinæ at great depths,\r\nwhich are based upon the supposed difficulty of maintaining animal\r\nlife under such conditions; and it throws the burden of proof upon\r\nthose who object to the supposition that the Globigerinæ live and die\r\nwhere they are found.]\r\n\r\nHowever, the important points for us are, that the living Globigerinæ\r\nare exclusively marine animals, the skeletons of which abound at the\r\nbottom of deep seas; and that there is not a shadow of reason for\r\nbelieving that the habits of the Globigerinæ of the chalk differed\r\nfrom those of the existing species. But if this be true, there is no\r\nescaping the conclusion that the chalk itself is the dried mud of an\r\nancient deep sea.\r\n\r\nIn working over the soundings collected by Captain Dayman, I was\r\nsurprised to find that many of what I have called the \"granules\" of\r\nthat mud were not, as one might have been tempted to think at first,\r\nthe mere powder and waste of Globigerinæ, but that they had a definite\r\nform and size. I termed these bodies \"_coccoliths_\" and doubted their\r\norganic nature. Dr. Wallich verified my observation, and added the\r\ninteresting discovery that, not unfrequently, bodies similar to these\r\n\"coccoliths\" were aggregated together into spheroids, which he termed\r\n\"_coccospheres_.\" So far as we knew, these bodies, the nature of which\r\nis extremely puzzling and problematical, were peculiar to the\r\nAtlantic soundings.\r\n\r\nBut, a few years ago, Mr. Sorby, in making a careful examination of\r\nthe chalk by means of thin sections and otherwise, observed, as\r\nEhrenberg had done before him, that much of its granular basis\r\npossesses a definite form. Comparing these formed particles with those\r\nin the Atlantic soundings, he found the two to be identical; and thus\r\nproved that the chalk, like the soundings, contains these mysterious\r\ncoccoliths and coccospheres. Here was a further and a most interesting\r\nconfirmation, from internal evidence, of the essential identity of the\r\nchalk with modern deep-sea mud. Globigerinæ, coccoliths, and\r\ncoccospheres are found as the chief constituents of both, and testify\r\nto the general similarity of the conditions under which both have been\r\nformed.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: I have recently traced out the development of the\r\n\"coccoliths\" from a diameter of 1/7000th of an inch up to their\r\nlargest size (which is about 1/1600th), and no longer doubt that they\r\nare produced by independent organisms, which, like the Globigerinæ,\r\nlive and die at the bottom of the sea.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence furnished by the hewing, facing, and superposition of the\r\nstones of the Pyramids, that these structures were built by men, has\r\nno greater weight than the evidence that the chalk was built by\r\nGlobigerinæ; and the belief that those ancient pyramid-builders were\r\nterrestrial and air-breathing creatures like ourselves, is not better\r\nbased than the conviction that the chalk-makers lived in the sea.\r\n\r\nBut as our belief in the building of the Pyramids by men is not only\r\ngrounded on the internal evidence afforded by these structures, but\r\ngathers strength from multitudinous collateral proofs, and is clinched\r\nby the total absence of any reason for a contrary belief; so the\r\nevidence drawn from the Globigerinæ that the chalk is an ancient\r\nsea-bottom, is fortified by innumerable independent lines of evidence;\r\nand our belief in the truth of the conclusion to which all positive\r\ntestimony tends, receives the like negative justification from the\r\nfact that no other hypothesis has a shadow of foundation.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth while briefly to consider a few of these collateral\r\nproofs that the chalk was deposited at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of the chalk is composed, as we have seen, of the\r\nskeletons of Globigerinæ, and other simple organisms, imbedded in\r\ngranular matter. Here and there, however, this hardened mud of the\r\nancient sea reveals the remains of higher animals which have lived and\r\ndied, and left their hard parts in the mud, just as the oysters die\r\nand leave their shells behind them, in the mud of the present seas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UPPER SILURIAN CORALS AND CRUSTACEANS.]\r\n\r\nThere are, at the present day, certain groups of animals which are\r\nnever found in fresh waters, being unable to live anywhere but in the\r\nsea. Such are the corals; those corallines which are called Polyzoa;\r\nthose creatures which fabricate the lamp-shells, and are called\r\nBrachiopoda; the pearly Nautilus, and all animals allied to it; and\r\nall the forms of sea-urchins and star-fishes.\r\n\r\nNot only are all these creatures confined to salt water at the present\r\nday, but, so far as our records of the past go, the conditions of\r\ntheir existence have been the same: hence, their occurrence in any\r\ndeposit is as strong evidence as can be obtained, that that deposit\r\nwas formed in the sea. Now the remains of animals of all the kinds\r\nwhich have been enumerated occur in the chalk, in greater or less\r\nabundance; while not one of those forms of shell-fish which are\r\ncharacteristic of fresh water has yet been observed in it.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that the remains of more than three thousand distinct\r\nspecies of aquatic animals have been discovered among the fossils of\r\nthe chalk, that the great majority of them are of such forms as are\r\nnow met with only in the sea, and that there is no reason to believe\r\nthat any one of them inhabited fresh water--the collateral evidence\r\nthat the chalk represents an ancient sea-bottom acquires as great\r\nforce as the proof derived from the nature of the chalk itself. I\r\nthink you will now allow that I did not overstate my case when I\r\nasserted that we have as strong grounds for believing that all the\r\nvast area of dry land at present occupied by the chalk was once at the\r\nbottom of the sea, as we have for any matter of history whatever;\r\nwhile there is no justification for any other belief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CRETACEOUS NAUTILUS.]\r\n\r\nNo less certain is it that the time during which the countries we now\r\ncall southeast England, France, Germany, Poland, Russia, Egypt,\r\nArabia, Syria, were more or less completely covered by a deep sea,\r\nwas of considerable duration.\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that the chalk is, in places, more than a\r\nthousand feet thick. I think you will agree with me that it must have\r\ntaken some time for the skeletons of the animalcules of a hundredth of\r\nan inch in diameter to heap up such a mass as that. I have said that\r\nthroughout the thickness of the chalk the remains of other animals are\r\nscattered. These remains are often in the most exquisite state of\r\npreservation. The valves of the shell-fishes are commonly adherent;\r\nthe long spines of some of the sea-urchins, which would be detached by\r\nthe smallest jar, often remain in their places. In a word, it is\r\ncertain that these animals have lived and died when the place which\r\nthey now occupy was the surface of as much of the chalk as had then\r\nbeen deposited; and that each has been covered up by the layer of\r\nGlobigerina mud, upon which the creatures imbedded a little higher up\r\nhave, in like manner, lived and died. But some of these remains prove\r\nthe existence of reptiles of vast size in the chalk sea. These lived\r\ntheir time, and had their ancestors and descendants, which assuredly\r\nimplies time, reptiles being of slow growth.\r\n\r\nThere is more curious evidence, again, that the process of covering\r\nup, or, in other words, the deposit of Globigerina skeletons, did not\r\ngo on very fast. It is demonstrable that an animal of the cretaceous\r\nsea might die, that its skeleton might lie uncovered upon the\r\nsea-bottom long enough to lose all its outward coverings and\r\nappendages by putrefaction; and that, after this had happened, another\r\nanimal might attach itself to the dead and naked skeleton, might grow\r\nto maturity, and might itself die before the calcareous mud had buried\r\nthe whole.\r\n\r\nCases of this kind are admirably described by Sir Charles Lyell. He\r\nspeaks of the frequency with which geologists find in the chalk a\r\nfossilized sea-urchin to which is attached the lower valve of a\r\nCrania. This is a kind of shell-fish, with a shell composed of two\r\npieces, of which, as in the oyster, one is fixed and the other free.\r\n\r\n\"The upper valve is almost invariably wanting, though occasionally\r\nfound in a perfect state of preservation in the white chalk at some\r\ndistance. In this case, we see clearly that the sea-urchin first lived\r\nfrom youth to age, then died and lost its spines, which were carried\r\naway. Then the young Crania adhered to the bared shell, grew and\r\nperished in its turn; after which, the upper valve was separated from\r\nthe lower, before the Echinus became enveloped in chalky mud.\"\r\n\r\nA specimen in the Museum of Practical Geology, in London, still\r\nfurther prolongs the period which must have elapsed between the death\r\nof the sea-urchin and its burial by the Globigeringæ. For the outward\r\nface of the valve of a Crania, which is attached to a sea-urchin\r\n(Micrastor), is itself overrun by an incrusting coralline, which\r\nspreads thence over more or less of the surface of the sea-urchin. It\r\nfollows that, after the upper valve of the Crania fell off, the\r\nsurface of the attached valve must have remained exposed long enough\r\nto allow of the growth of the whole coralline, since corallines do not\r\nlive imbedded in the mud.\r\n\r\nThe progress of knowledge may, one day, enable us to deduce from such\r\nfacts as these the maximum rate at which the chalk can have\r\naccumulated, and thus to arrive at the minimum duration of the chalk\r\nperiod. Suppose that the valve of the Crania upon which a coralline\r\nhas fixed itself in the way just described is so attached to the\r\nsea-urchin that no part of it is more than an inch above the face upon\r\nwhich the sea-urchin rests. Then, as the coralline could not have\r\nfixed itself if the Crania had been covered up with chalk-mud, and\r\ncould not have lived had itself been so covered, it follows, that an\r\ninch of chalk mud could not have accumulated within the time between\r\nthe death and decay of the soft parts of the sea-urchin and the growth\r\nof the coralline to the full size which it has attained. If the decay\r\nof the soft parts of the sea-urchin; the attachment, growth to\r\nmaturity, and decay of the Crania; and the subsequent attachment and\r\ngrowth of the coralline, took a year (which is a low estimate enough),\r\nthe accumulation of the inch of chalk must have taken more than a\r\nyear: and the deposit of a thousand feet of chalk must, consequently,\r\nhave taken more than twelve thousand years.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of all this calculation is, of course, a knowledge of\r\nthe length of time the Crania and the coralline needed to attain their\r\nfull size; and, on this head, precise knowledge is at present wanting.\r\nBut there are circumstances which tend to show that nothing like an\r\ninch of chalk has accumulated during the life of a Crania; and, on any\r\nprobable estimate of the length of that life, the chalk period must\r\nhave had a much longer duration than that thus roughly assigned to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThus, not only is it certain that the chalk is the mud of an ancient\r\nsea-bottom; but it is no less certain that the chalk sea existed\r\nduring an extremely long period, though we may not be prepared to give\r\na precise estimate of the length of that period in years. The relative\r\nduration is clear, though the absolute duration may not be definable.\r\nThe attempt to affix any precise date to the period at which the chalk\r\nsea began or ended its existence, is baffled by difficulties of the\r\nsame kind. But the relative age of the cretaceous epoch may be\r\ndetermined with as great ease and certainty as the long duration of\r\nthat epoch.\r\n\r\nYou will have heard of the interesting discoveries recently made, in\r\nvarious parts of Western Europe, of flint implements, obviously worked\r\ninto shape by human hands, under circumstances which show conclusively\r\nthat man is a very ancient denizen of these regions.\r\n\r\nIt has been proved that the old populations of Europe, whose existence\r\nhas been revealed to us in this way, consisted of savages, such as the\r\nEsquimaux are now; that, in the country which is now France, they\r\nhunted the reindeer, and were familiar with the ways of the mammoth\r\nand the bison. The physical geography of France was in those days\r\ndifferent from what it is now--the river Somme, for instance, having\r\ncut its bed a hundred feet deeper between that time and this; and it\r\nis probable that the climate was more like that of Canada or Siberia\r\nthan that of Western Europe.\r\n\r\nThe existence of these people is forgotten even in the traditions of\r\nthe oldest historical nations. The name and fame of them had utterly\r\nvanished until a few years back; and the amount of physical change\r\nwhich has been effected since their day renders it more than probable\r\nthat, venerable as are some of the historical nations, the workers of\r\nthe chipped flints of Hoxne or of Amiens are to them, as they are to\r\nus, in point of antiquity.\r\n\r\nBut, if we assign to these hoar relics of long-vanished generations of\r\nmen the greatest age that can possibly be claimed for them, they are\r\nnot older than the drift, or boulder clay, which, in comparison with\r\nthe chalk, is but a very juvenile deposit. You need go no further than\r\nyour own seaboard for evidence of this fact. At one of the most\r\ncharming spots on the coast of Norfolk, Cromer, you will see the\r\nboulder clay forming a vast mass, which lies upon the chalk, and must\r\nconsequently have come into existence after it. Huge boulders of chalk\r\nare, in fact, included in the clay, and have evidently been brought to\r\nthe position they now occupy by the same agency as that which has\r\nplanted blocks of syenite from Norway side by side with them.\r\n\r\nThe chalk, then, is certainly older than the boulder clay. If you ask\r\nhow much, I will again take you no further than the same spot upon\r\nyour own coasts for evidence. I have spoken of the boulder clay and\r\ndrift as resting upon the chalk. That is not strictly true. Interposed\r\nbetween the chalk and the drift is a comparatively insignificant\r\nlayer, containing vegetable matter. But that layer tells a wonderful\r\nhistory. It is full of stumps of trees standing as they grew.\r\nFir-trees are there with their cones, and hazel-bushes with their\r\nnuts; there stand the stools of oak and yew trees, beeches and\r\nalders. Hence this stratum is appropriately called the \"forest-bed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the chalk must have been upheaved and converted\r\ninto dry land before the timber trees could grow upon it. As the bolls\r\nof some of these trees are from two to three feet in diameter, it is\r\nno less clear that the dry land thus formed remained in the same\r\ncondition for long ages. And not only do the remains of stately oaks\r\nand well-grown firs testify to the duration of this condition of\r\nthings, but additional evidence to the same effect is afforded by the\r\nabundant remains of elephants, rhinoceroses, hippopotamuses, and other\r\ngreat wild beasts, which it has yielded to the zealous search of such\r\nmen as the Rev. Mr. Gunn.\r\n\r\nWhen you look at such a collection as he has formed, and bethink you\r\nthat these elephantine bones did veritably carry their owners about,\r\nand these great grinders crunch, in the dark woods of which the\r\nforest-bed is now the only trace, it is impossible not to feel that\r\nthey are as good evidence of the lapse of time as the annual rings of\r\nthe tree-stumps.\r\n\r\nThus there is a writing upon the wall of cliffs at Cromer, and whoso\r\nruns may read it. It tells us, with an authority which cannot be\r\nimpeached, that the ancient sea-bed of the chalk sea was raised up,\r\nand remained dry land, until it was covered with forest, stocked with\r\nthe great game whose spoils have rejoiced your geologists. How long it\r\nremained in that condition cannot be said; but \"the whirligig of time\r\nbrought its revenges\" in those days as in these. That dry land, with\r\nthe bones and teeth of generations of long-lived elephants, hidden\r\naway among the gnarled roots and dry leaves of its ancient trees, sank\r\ngradually to the bottom of the icy sea, which covered it with huge\r\nmasses of drift and boulder clay. Sea-beasts, such as the walrus, now\r\nrestricted to the extreme north, paddled about where birds had\r\ntwittered among the topmost twigs of the fir-trees. How long this\r\nstate of things endured we know not, but at length it came to an end.\r\nThe upheaved glacial mud hardened into the soil of modern Norfolk.\r\nForests grew once more, the wolf and the beaver replaced the reindeer\r\nand the elephant; and at length what we call the history of England\r\ndawned.\r\n\r\nThus you have, within the limits of your own county, proof that the\r\nchalk can justly claim a very much greater antiquity than even the\r\noldest physical traces of mankind. But we may go further and\r\ndemonstrate, by evidence of the same authority as that which testifies\r\nto the existence of the father of men, that the chalk is vastly older\r\nthan Adam himself.\r\n\r\nThe Book of Genesis informs us that Adam, immediately upon his\r\ncreation, and before the appearance of Eve, was placed in the garden\r\nof Eden. The problem of the geographical position of Eden has greatly\r\nvexed the spirits of the learned in such matters, but there is one\r\npoint respecting which, so far as I know, no commentator has ever\r\nraised a doubt. This is, that of the four rivers which are said to run\r\nout of it, Euphrates and Hiddekel are identical with the rivers now\r\nknown by the names of Euphrates and Tigris.\r\n\r\nBut the whole country in which these mighty rivers take their origin,\r\nand through which they run, is composed of rocks which are either of\r\nthe same age as the chalk, or of later date. So that the chalk must\r\nnot only have been formed, but, after its formation, the time required\r\nfor the deposit of these later rocks, and for their upheaval into dry\r\nland, must have elapsed, before the smallest brook which feeds the\r\nswift stream of \"the great river, the river of Babylon,\" began to\r\nflow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThus, evidence which cannot be rebutted, and which need not be\r\nstrengthened, though if time permitted I might indefinitely increase\r\nits quantity, compels you to believe that the earth, from the time of\r\nthe chalk to the present day, has been the theatre of a series of\r\nchanges as vast in their amount as they were slow in their progress.\r\nThe area on which we stand has been first sea and then land, for at\r\nleast four alternations; and has remained in each of these conditions\r\nfor a period of great length.\r\n\r\nNor have these wonderful metamorphoses of sea into land, and of land\r\ninto sea, been confined to one corner of England. During the chalk\r\nperiod, or \"cretaceous epoch,\" not one of the present great physical\r\nfeatures of the globe was in existence. Our great mountain ranges,\r\nPyrenees, Alps, Himalayas, Andes, have all been upheaved since the\r\nchalk was deposited, and the cretaceous sea flowed over the sites of\r\nSinai and Ararat.\r\n\r\nAll this is certain, because rocks of cretaceous or still later date\r\nhave shared in the elevatory movements which gave rise to these\r\nmountain chains; and may be found perched up, in some cases, many\r\nthousand feet high upon their flanks. And evidence of equal cogency\r\ndemonstrates that, though in Norfolk the forest-bed rests directly\r\nupon the chalk, yet it does so, not because the period at which the\r\nforest grew immediately followed that at which the chalk was formed,\r\nbut because an immense lapse of time, represented elsewhere by\r\nthousands of feet of rock, is not indicated at Cromer.\r\n\r\nI must ask you to believe that there is no less conclusive proof that\r\na still more prolonged succession of similar changes occurred before\r\nthe chalk was deposited. Nor have we any reason to think that the\r\nfirst term in the series of these changes is known. The oldest\r\nsea-beds preserved to us are sands, and mud, and pebbles, the wear and\r\ntear of rocks which were formed in still older oceans.\r\n\r\nBut, great as is the magnitude of these physical changes of the world,\r\nthey have been accompanied by a no less striking series of\r\nmodifications in its living inhabitants.\r\n\r\nAll the great classes of animals, beasts of the field, fowls of the\r\nair, creeping things, and things which dwell in the waters, flourished\r\nupon the globe long ages before the chalk was deposited. Very few,\r\nhowever, if any, of these ancient forms of animal life were identical\r\nwith those which now live. Certainly not one of the higher animals was\r\nof the same species as any of those now in existence. The beasts of\r\nthe field, in the days before the chalk, were not our beasts of the\r\nfield, nor the fowls of the air such as those which the eye of man has\r\nseen flying, unless his antiquity dates infinitely further back than\r\nwe at present surmise. If we could be carried back into those times,\r\nwe should be as one suddenly set down in Australia before it was\r\ncolonized. We should see mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, insects,\r\nsnails, and the like, clearly recognizable as such, and yet not one of\r\nthem would be just the same as those with which we are familiar, and\r\nmany would be extremely different.\r\n\r\nFrom that time to the present, the population of the world has\r\nundergone slow and gradual, but incessant, changes. There has been no\r\ngrand catastrophe--no destroyer has swept away the forms of life of\r\none period, and replaced them by a totally new creation; but one\r\nspecies has vanished and another has taken its place; creatures of one\r\ntype of structure have diminished, those of another have increased, as\r\ntime has passed on. And thus, while the differences between the living\r\ncreatures of the time before the chalk and those of the present day\r\nappear startling, if placed side by side, we are led from one to the\r\nother by the most gradual progress, if we follow the course of Nature\r\nthrough the whole series of those relics of her operations which she\r\nhas left behind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKELETON OF THE PTERODACTYL.]\r\n\r\nAnd it is by the population of the chalk sea that the ancient and the\r\nmodern inhabitants of the world are most completely connected. The\r\ngroups which are dying out flourish, side by side, with the groups\r\nwhich are now the dominant forms of life.\r\n\r\nThus the chalk contains remains of those flying and swimming\r\nreptiles, the pterodactyl, the ichthyosaurus, and the plesiosaurus,\r\nwhich are found in no later deposits, but abounded in preceding ages.\r\nThe chambered shells called ammonites and belemnites, which are so\r\ncharacteristic of the period preceding the cretaceous, in like manner\r\ndie with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SKELETON OF THE ICHTHYOSAURUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SKELETON OF THE PLESIOSAURUS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AMMONITES.]\r\n\r\nBut, among these fading remainders of a previous state of things, are\r\nsome very modern forms of life, looking like Yankee peddlers among a\r\ntribe of red Indians. Crocodiles of modern type appear; bony fishes,\r\nmany of them very similar to existing species, almost supplant the\r\nforms of fish which predominate in more ancient seas; and many kinds\r\nof living shell-fish first become known to us in the chalk. The\r\nvegetation acquires a modern aspect. A few living animals are not even\r\ndistinguishable as species from those which existed at that remote\r\nepoch. The Globigerina of the present day, for example, is not\r\ndifferent specifically from that of the chalk; and the same may be\r\nsaid of many other Foraminifera. I think it probable that critical and\r\nunprejudiced examination will show that more than one species of much\r\nhigher animals have had a similar longevity; but the only example\r\nwhich I can at present give confidently is the snake's-head lamp-shell\r\n(_Terebratulina caput serpentis_), which lives in our English seas and\r\nabounded (as _Terebratulina striata_ of authors) in the chalk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BELEMNITES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TEREBRATULINA.]\r\n\r\nThe longest line of human ancestry must hide its diminished head\r\nbefore the pedigree of this insignificant shell-fish. We Englishmen\r\nare proud to have an ancestor who was present at the Battle of\r\nHastings. The ancestors of _Terebratulina caput serpentis_ may have\r\nbeen present at a battle of Ichthyosauria in that part of the sea\r\nwhich, when the chalk was forming, flowed over the site of Hastings.\r\nWhile all around has changed, this Terebratulina has peacefully\r\npropagated its species from generation to generation, and stands to\r\nthis day as a living testimony to the continuity of the present with\r\nthe past history of the globe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nUp to this moment I have stated, so far as I know, nothing but\r\nwell-authenticated facts, and the immediate conclusions which they\r\nforce upon the mind.\r\n\r\nBut the mind is so constituted that it does not willingly rest in\r\nfacts and immediate causes, but seeks always after a knowledge of the\r\nremoter links in the chain of causation.\r\n\r\nTaking the many changes of any given spot of the earth's surface, from\r\nsea to land, and from land to sea, as an established fact, we cannot\r\nrefrain from asking ourselves how these changes have occurred. And\r\nwhen we have explained them--as they must be explained--by the\r\nalternate slow movements of elevation and depression which have\r\naffected the crusts of the earth, we go still further back, and ask,\r\nWhy these movements?\r\n\r\nI am not certain that any one can give you a satisfactory answer to\r\nthat question. Assuredly I cannot. All that can be said for certain\r\nis, that such movements are part of the ordinary course of nature,\r\ninasmuch as they are going on at the present time. Direct proof may be\r\ngiven, that some parts of the land of the northern hemisphere are at\r\nthis moment insensibly rising and others insensibly sinking; and there\r\nis indirect but perfectly satisfactory proof, that an enormous area\r\nnow covered by the Pacific has been deepened thousands of feet since\r\nthe present inhabitants of that sea came into existence.\r\n\r\nThus there is not a shadow of a reason for believing that the\r\nphysical changes of the globe, in past times, have been effected by\r\nother than natural causes.\r\n\r\nIs there any more reason for believing that the concomitant\r\nmodifications in the forms of the living inhabitants of the globe have\r\nbeen brought about in any other ways?\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to answer this question, let us try to form a\r\ndistinct mental picture of what has happened in some special case.\r\n\r\nThe crocodiles are animals which, as a group, have a very vast\r\nantiquity. They abounded ages before the chalk was deposited; they\r\nthrong the rivers in warm climates at the present day. There is a\r\ndifference in the form of the joints of the backbone, and in some\r\nminor particulars, between the crocodiles of the present epoch and\r\nthose which lived before the chalk; but, in the cretaceous epoch, as I\r\nhave already mentioned, the crocodiles had assumed the modern type of\r\nstructure. Notwithstanding this, the crocodiles of the chalk are not\r\nidentically the same as those which lived in the times called \"older\r\ntertiary,\" which succeeded the cretaceous epoch; and the crocodiles of\r\nthe older tertiaries are not identical with those of the newer\r\ntertiaries, nor are these identical with existing forms. I leave open\r\nthe question whether particular species may have lived on from epoch\r\nto epoch. But each epoch has had its peculiar crocodiles; though all,\r\nsince the chalk, have belonged to the modern type, and differ simply\r\nin their proportions and in such structural particulars as are\r\ndiscernible only to trained eyes.\r\n\r\nHow is the existence of this long succession of different species of\r\ncrocodiles to be accounted for?\r\n\r\nOnly two suppositions seem to be open to us--either each species of\r\ncrocodile has been specially created, or it has arisen out of some\r\npre-existing form by the operation of natural causes.\r\n\r\nChoose your hypothesis; I have chosen mine. I can find no warranty for\r\nbelieving in the distinct creation of a score of successive species of\r\ncrocodiles in the course of countless ages of time. Science gives no\r\ncountenance to such a wild fancy; nor can even the perverse ingenuity\r\nof a commentator pretend to discover this sense, in the simple words\r\nin which the writer of Genesis records the proceeding of the fifth and\r\nsixth days of the Creation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I see no good reason for doubting the necessary\r\nalternative, that all these varied species have been evolved from\r\npre-existing crocodilian forms by the operation of causes as\r\ncompletely a part of the common order of nature as those which have\r\neffected the changes of the inorganic world.\r\n\r\nFew will venture to affirm that the reasoning which applies to\r\ncrocodiles loses its force among other animals or among plants. If one\r\nseries of species has come into existence by the operation of natural\r\ncauses, it seems folly to deny that all may have arisen in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA small beginning has led us to a great ending. If I were to put the\r\nbit of chalk with which we started into the hot but obscure flame of\r\nburning hydrogen, it would presently shine like the sun. It seems to\r\nme that this physical metamorphosis is no false image of what has been\r\nthe result of our subjecting it to a jet of fervent, though nowise\r\nbrilliant, thought to-night. It has become luminous, and its clear\r\nrays, penetrating the abyss of the remote past, have brought within\r\nour ken some stages of the evolution of the earth. And in the shifting\r\n\"without haste, but without rest\" of the land and sea, as in the\r\nendless variation of the forms assumed by living beings, we have\r\nobserved nothing but the natural product of the forces originally\r\npossessed by the substance of the universe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA BIT OF SPONGE\r\n\r\n(Written on Scotland.)\r\n\r\n(FROM GLIMPSES OF NATURE.)\r\n\r\nBY A. WILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis morning, despite the promise of rain over-night, has broken with\r\nall the signs and symptoms of a bright July day. The Firth is bathed\r\nin sunlight, and the wavelets at full tide are kissing the strand,\r\nmaking a soft musical ripple as they retire, and as the pebbles run\r\ndown the sandy slope on the retreat of the waves. Beyond the farthest\r\ncontact of the tide is a line of seaweed dried and desiccated, mixed\r\nup with which, in confusing array, are masses of shells, and such\r\n_olla podrida_ of the sea.\r\n\r\nTossed up at our very feet is a dried fragment of sponge, which\r\ndoubtless the unkind waves tore from its rocky bed. It is not a large\r\nportion of sponge this, but its structure is nevertheless to be fairly\r\nmade out, and some reminiscences of its history gleaned, for the sake\r\nof occupying the by no means \"bad half-hour\" before breakfast. \"What\r\nis a sponge?\" is a question which you may well ask as a necessary\r\npreliminary to the understanding of its personality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SPONGE ATTACHED TO ITS ROCKY BED.]\r\n\r\nThe questionings of childhood and the questionings of science run in\r\nprecisely similar grooves. \"What is it?\" and \"How does it live?\" and\r\n\"Where does it come from?\" are equally the inquiries of childhood, and\r\nof the deepest philosophy which seeks to determine the whole history\r\nof life. This morning, we cannot do better than follow in the\r\nfootsteps of the child, and to the question, \"What is a sponge?\" I\r\nfancy science will be able to return a direct answer. First of all, we\r\nmay note that a sponge, as we know it in common life, is the horny\r\nskeleton or framework which was made by, and which supported, the\r\nliving parts. These living parts consist of minute masses of that\r\nliving jelly to which the name of _protoplasm_ has been applied. This,\r\nin truth, is the universal matter of life. It is the one substance\r\nwith which life everywhere is associated, and as we see it simply in\r\nthe sponge, so also we behold it (only in more complex guise) in the\r\nman. Now, the living parts of this dried cast-away sponge were found\r\nboth in its interior and on its surface. They lined the canals that\r\neverywhere permeate the sponge-substance, and microscopic examination\r\nhas told us a great deal about their nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. DEVELOPMENT OF A SPONGE (_Olynthus_). 1. The\r\negg. 2, 3, and 4. The process of egg-division. 5 and 6. The\r\ngastrula-stage. 7. The perfect sponge.]\r\n\r\nFor, whether found in the canals of the sponge themselves, or embedded\r\nin the sponge-substance, the living sponge-particles are represented\r\neach by a semi-independent mass of protoplasm. So that the first view\r\nI would have you take of the sponge as a living mass, is, that it is a\r\ncolony and not a single unit. It is composed, in other words, of\r\naggregated masses of living particles, which bud out one from the\r\nother, and manufacture the supporting skeleton we know as \"the sponge\r\nof commerce\" itself. Under the microscope, these living sponge-units\r\nappear in various guises and shapes. Some of them are formless, and,\r\nas to shape, ever-altering masses, resembling that familiar animalcule\r\nof our pools we know as the _Amoeba_. These members of the\r\nsponge-colony form the bulk of the population. They are embedded in\r\nthe sponge substance; they wander about through the meshes of the\r\nsponge; they seize food and flourish and grow; and they probably also\r\ngive origin to the \"eggs\" from which new sponges are in due course\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nMore characteristic however, are certain units of this living\r\nsponge-colony which live in the lining membrane of the canals. In\r\npoint of fact, a sponge is a kind of Venice, a certain proportion of\r\nwhose inhabitants, like those of the famous Queen of the Adriatic\r\nherself, live on the banks of the waterways. Just as in Venice we find\r\nthe provisions for the denizens of the city brought to the inhabitants\r\nby the canals, so from the water, which, as we shall see, is\r\nperpetually circulating through a sponge, the members of the\r\nsponge-colony receive their food.\r\n\r\nLook, again, at the sponge-fragment which lies before us. You perceive\r\nhalf a dozen large holes or so, each opening on a little eminence, as\r\nit were. These apertures, bear in mind, we call _oscula_. They are the\r\nexits of the sponge-domain. But a close inspection of a sponge shows\r\nthat it is riddled with finer and smaller apertures. These latter are\r\nthe _pores_, and they form the entrances to the sponge-domain.\r\n\r\nOn the banks of the canal you may see growing plentifully in summer\r\ntime a green sponge, which is the common fresh-water species. Now, if\r\nyou drop a living specimen of this species into a bowl of water, and\r\nput some powdered indigo into the water, you may note how the currents\r\nare perpetually being swept in by the pores and out by the oscula. In\r\nevery living sponge this perpetual and unceasing circulation of water\r\nproceeds. This is the sole evidence the unassisted sight receives of\r\nthe vitality of the sponge-colony, and the importance of this\r\ncirculation in aiding life in these depths, to be fairly carried out\r\ncannot readily be over-estimated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHERE SPONGES GROW.]\r\n\r\nLet us now see how this circulation is maintained. Microscopically\r\nregarded, we see here and there, in the sides of the sponge-passages,\r\nlittle chambers and recesses which remind one of the passing-places in\r\na narrow canal. Lining these chambers, we see living sponge-units of a\r\ntype different from the shapeless specks we noted to occur in the\r\nmeshes of the sponge substance itself. The units of the recesses each\r\nconsist of a living particle, whose free extremity is raised into a\r\nkind of collar, from which projects a lash-like filament known as a\r\nflagellum.\r\n\r\nThis lash is in constant movement. It waves to and fro in the water,\r\nand the collection of lashes we see in any one chamber acts as a\r\nveritable brush, which by its movement not only sweeps water in by the\r\npores, but sends it onwards through the sponge, and in due time sends\r\nit out by the bigger holes, or oscula. This constant circulation in\r\nthe sponge discharges more than one important function. For, as\r\nalready noted, it serves the purpose of nutrition, in that the\r\nparticles on which sponge-life is supported are swept into the colony.\r\n\r\nAgain, the fresh currents of water carry with them the oxygen gas\r\nwhich is a necessity of sponge existence, as of human life; while,\r\nthirdly, waste matters, inevitably alike in sponge and in man as the\r\nresult of living, are swept out of the colony, and discharged into the\r\nsea beyond. Our bit of sponge has thus grown from a mere dry fragment\r\ninto a living reality. It is a community in which already, low as it\r\nis, the work of life has come to be discharged by distinct and fairly\r\nspecialized beings.\r\n\r\nThe era of new sponge-life is inaugurated by means of egg-development,\r\nalthough there exists another fashion (that of gemmules or buds)\r\nwhereby out of the parental substance young sponges are produced. A\r\nsponge-egg develops, as do all eggs, in a definite cycle. It undergoes\r\ndivision (Fig. 1); its one cell becomes many; and its many cells\r\narrange themselves first of all into a cup-like form (5, 6 and 7),\r\nwhich may remain in this shape if the sponge is a simple one, or\r\nbecome developed into the more complex shape of the sponges we know.\r\n\r\nIn every museum you may see specimens of a beautiful vase-like\r\nstructure seemingly made of spun-glass. This is a flinty sponge, the\r\n\"Venus flower-basket,\" whose presence in the sponge family redeems it\r\nfrom the charge that it contains no things of beauty whatever. So,\r\ntoo, the rocks are full of fossil-sponges, many of quaint form. Our\r\npiece of sponge, as we may understand, has yet other bits of history\r\nattached to it.... Meanwhile, think over the sponge and its ways, and\r\nlearn from it that out of the dry things of life, science weaves many\r\na fairy tale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREATEST SEA-WAVE EVER KNOWN\r\n\r\n(FROM LIGHT SCIENCE IN LEISURE HOURS.)\r\n\r\nBY R.A. PROCTOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAugust 13th, 1868, one of the most terrible calamities which has ever\r\nvisited a people befell the unfortunate inhabitants of Peru. In that\r\nland earthquakes are nearly as common as rain storms are with us; and\r\nshocks by which whole cities are changed into a heap of ruins are by\r\nno means infrequent. Yet even in Peru, \"the land of earthquakes,\" as\r\nHumboldt has termed it, no such catastrophe as that of August, 1868,\r\nhad occurred within the memory of man. It was not one city which was\r\nlaid in ruins, but a whole empire. Those who perished were counted by\r\ntens of thousands, while the property destroyed by the earthquake was\r\nvalued at millions of pounds sterling.\r\n\r\nAlthough so many months have passed since this terrible calamity took\r\nplace, scientific men have been busily engaged, until quite recently,\r\nin endeavoring to ascertain the real significance of the various\r\nevents which were observed during and after the occurrence of the\r\nearthquake. The geographers of Germany have taken a special interest\r\nin interpreting the evidence afforded by this great manifestation of\r\nNature's powers. Two papers have been written recently on the great\r\nearthquake of August 13th, 1868--one by Professor von Hochsteter, the\r\nother by Herr von Tschudi, which present an interesting account of the\r\nvarious effects, by land and by sea, which resulted from the\r\ntremendous upheaving force to which the western flanks of the Peruvian\r\nAndes were subjected on that day. The effects on land, although\r\nsurprising and terrible, only differ in degree from those which have\r\nbeen observed in other earthquakes. But the progress of the great\r\nsea-wave which was generated by the upheaval of the Peruvian shores\r\nand propagated over the whole of the Pacific Ocean differs altogether\r\nfrom any earthquake phenomena before observed. Other earthquakes have\r\nindeed been followed by oceanic disturbances; but these have been\r\naccompanied by terrestrial motions, so as to suggest the idea that\r\nthey had been caused by the motion of the sea-bottom or of the\r\nneighboring land. In no instance has it ever before been known that a\r\nwell-marked wave of enormous proportions should have been propagated\r\nover the largest ocean tract on our globe by an earth-shock whose\r\ndirect action was limited to a relatively small region, and that\r\nregion not situated in the centre, but on one side of the wide area\r\ntraversed by the wave.\r\n\r\nWe propose to give a brief sketch of the history of this enormous\r\nsea-wave. In the first place, however, it may be well to remind the\r\nreader of a few of the more prominent features of the great shock to\r\nwhich this wave owed its origin.\r\n\r\nIt was at Arequipa, at the foot of the lofty volcanic mountain Misti,\r\nthat the most terrible effects of the great earthquake were\r\nexperienced. Within historic times Misti has poured forth no lava\r\nstreams, but that the volcano is not extinct is clearly evidenced by\r\nthe fact that in 1542 an enormous mass of dust and ashes was vomited\r\nforth from its crater. On August 13th. 1868, Misti showed no signs of\r\nbeing disturbed. So far as the volcanic neighbor was concerned, the\r\nforty-four thousand inhabitants of Arequipa had no reason to\r\nanticipate the catastrophe which presently befell them. At five\r\nminutes past five an earthquake shock was experienced, which, though\r\nsevere, seems to have worked little mischief. Half a minute later,\r\nhowever, a terrible noise was heard beneath the earth; a second shock\r\nmore violent than the first was felt, and then began a swaying motion,\r\ngradually increasing in intensity. In the-course of the first minute\r\nthis motion had become so violent that the inhabitants ran in terror\r\nout of their houses into the streets and squares. In the next two\r\nminutes the swaying movement had so increased that the more lightly\r\nbuilt houses were cast to the ground, and the flying people could\r\nscarcely keep their feet. \"And now,\" says Von Tschudi, \"there followed\r\nduring two or three minutes a terrible scene. The swaying motion which\r\nhad hitherto prevailed changed into fierce vertical upheaval. The\r\nsubterranean roaring increased in the most terrifying manner; then\r\nwere heard the heart-piercing shrieks of the wretched people, the\r\nbursting of walls, the crashing fall of houses and churches, while\r\nover all rolled thick clouds of a yellowish-black dust, which, had\r\nthey been poured forth many minutes longer, would have suffocated\r\nthousands.\" Although the shocks had lasted but a few minutes, the whole\r\ntown was destroyed. Not one building remained uninjured, and there\r\nwere few which did not lie in shapeless heaps of ruins.\r\n\r\nAt Tacna and Arica the earth-shock was less severe, but strange and\r\nterrible phenomena followed it. At the former place a circumstance\r\noccurred the cause and nature of which yet remain a mystery. About\r\nthree hours after the earthquake--in other words, at about eight\r\no'clock in the evening--an intensely brilliant light made its\r\nappearance above the neighboring mountains. It lasted for fully half\r\nan hour, and has been ascribed to the eruption of some as yet unknown\r\nvolcano.\r\n\r\nAt Arica the sea-wave produced even more destructive effects than had\r\nbeen caused by the earthquake. About twenty minutes after the first\r\nearth-shock the sea was seen to retire, as if about to leave the\r\nshores wholly dry; but presently its waters returned with tremendous\r\nforce. A mighty wave, whose length seemed immeasurable, was seen\r\nadvancing like a dark wall upon the unfortunate town, a large part of\r\nwhich was overwhelmed by it. Two ships, the Peruvian corvette America,\r\nand the United States \"double-ender\" Wateree, were carried nearly half\r\na mile to the north of Arica beyond the railroad which runs to Tacna,\r\nand there left stranded high and dry. This enormous wave was\r\nconsidered by the English vice-consul at Arica to have been fully\r\nfifty feet in height.\r\n\r\nAt Chala three such waves swept in after the first shocks of\r\nearthquake. They overflowed nearly the whole of the town, the sea\r\npassing more than half a mile beyond its usual limits.\r\n\r\nAt Islay and Iquique similar phenomena were manifested. At the former\r\ntown the lava flowed in no less than five times, and each time with\r\ngreater force. Afterward the motion gradually diminished, but even an\r\nhour and a half after the commencement of this strange disturbance the\r\nwaves still ran forty feet above the ordinary level. At Iquique the\r\npeople beheld the inrushing wave while it was still a great way off. A\r\ndark blue mass of water some fifty feet in height was seen sweeping in\r\nupon the town with inconceivable rapidity. An island lying before the\r\nharbor was completely submerged by the great wave, which still came\r\nrushing on black with the mud and slime it had swept from the\r\nsea-bottom. Those who witnessed its progress from the upper balconies\r\nof their houses, and presently saw its black mass rushing close\r\nbeneath their feet, looked on their safety as a miracle. Many\r\nbuildings were indeed washed away, and in the low-lying parts of the\r\ntown there was a terrible loss of life. After passing far inland, the\r\nwave slowly returned sea-ward, and, strangely enough, the sea, which\r\nelsewhere heaved and tossed for hours after the first great wave had\r\nswept over it, here came soon to rest.\r\n\r\nAt Callao a yet more singular instance was afforded of the effect\r\nwhich circumstances may have upon the motion of the sea after a great\r\nearthquake has disturbed it. In former earthquakes Callao has suffered\r\nterribly from the effects of the great sea-wave. In fact, on two\r\noccasions the whole town has been destroyed, and nearly all its\r\ninhabitants have been drowned, through the inrush of precisely such\r\nwaves as flowed into the ports of Arica and Chala. But upon this\r\noccasion the centre of subterranean disturbance must have been so\r\nsituated that either the wave was diverted from Callao, or, more\r\nprobably, two waves reached Callao from different sources and at\r\ndifferent times, so that the two undulations partly counteracted each\r\nother. Certain it is that, although the water retreated strangely from\r\nthe coast near Callao, insomuch that a wide tract of the sea-bottom\r\nwas uncovered, there was no inrushing wave comparable with those\r\ndescribed above. The sea afterward rose and fell in an irregular\r\nmanner, a circumstance confirming the supposition that the disturbance\r\nwas caused by two distinct oscillations. Six hours after the\r\noccurrence of the earth-shock the double oscillations seemed for a\r\nwhile to have worked themselves into unison, for at this time three\r\nconsiderable waves rolled in upon the town. But clearly these waves\r\nmust not be compared with those which in other instances had made\r\ntheir appearance within half an hour of the earth-throes. There is\r\nlittle reason to doubt that if the separate oscillations had\r\nre-enforced each other earlier, Callao would have been completely\r\ndestroyed. As it was, a considerable amount of mischief was effected;\r\nbut the motion of the sea presently became irregular again, and so\r\ncontinued until the morning of August 14th, when it began to ebb with\r\nsome regularity. But during the 14th there were occasional renewals of\r\nthe irregular motion, and several days elapsed before the regular ebb\r\nand flow of the sea were resumed.\r\n\r\nSuch were among the phenomena presented in the region where the\r\nearthquake itself was felt. It will be seen at once that within this\r\nregion, or rather along that portion of the sea-coast which falls\r\nwithin the central region of disturbance, the true character of the\r\nsea-wave generated by the earthquake could not be recognized. If a\r\nrock fall from a lofty cliff into a comparatively shallow sea, the\r\nwater around the place where the rock has fallen is disturbed in an\r\nirregular manner. The sea seems at one place to leap up and down;\r\nelsewhere one wave seems to beat against another, and the sharpest eye\r\ncan detect no law in the motion of the seething waters. But presently,\r\noutside the scene of disturbance, a circular wave is seen to form, and\r\nif the motion of this wave be watched it is seen to present the most\r\nstriking contrast with the turmoil and confusion at its centre. It\r\nsweeps onward and outward in a regular undulation. Gradually it loses\r\nits circular figure (unless the sea-bottom happens to be unusually\r\nlevel), showing that although its motion is everywhere regular, it is\r\nnot everywhere equally swift. A wave of this sort, though incomparably\r\nvaster, swept swiftly away on every side from the scene of the great\r\nearthquake near the Peruvian Andes. It has been calculated that the\r\nwidth of this wave varied from one million to five million feet, or,\r\nroughly, from two hundred to one thousand miles, while, when in\r\nmid-Pacific, the length of the wave, measured along its summit in a\r\nwidely-curved path from one side to another of the great ocean,\r\ncannot have been less than eight thousand miles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OVER A LARGE PORTION OF ITS COURSE ITS PASSAGE WAS\r\nUNNOTED.]\r\n\r\nWe cannot tell how deep-seated was the centre of subterranean action;\r\nbut there can be no doubt it was very deep indeed, because otherwise\r\nthe shock felt in towns separated from each other by hundreds of miles\r\ncould not have been so nearly contemporaneous. Therefore the portion\r\nof the earth's crust upheaved must have been enormous, for the length\r\nof the region where the direct effects of the earthquake were\r\nperceived is estimated by Professor von Hochsteter at no less than\r\ntwo hundred and forty miles. The breadth of the region is unknown,\r\nbecause the slope of the Andes on one side and the ocean on the other\r\nconcealed the motion of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\nThe great ocean-wave swept, as we have said, in all directions around\r\nthe scene of the earth-throe. Over a large part of its course its\r\npassage was unnoted, because in the open sea the effects even of so\r\nvast an undulation could not be perceived. A ship would slowly rise as\r\nthe crest of the great wave passed under her, and then as slowly sink\r\nagain. This may seem strange, at first sight, when it is remembered\r\nthat in reality the great sea-wave we are considering swept at the\r\nrate of three or four hundred sea-miles an hour over the larger part\r\nof the Pacific. But when the true character of ocean-waves is\r\nunderstood, when it is remembered that there is no transference of the\r\nwater itself at this enormous rate, but simply a transmission of\r\nmotion (precisely as when in a high wind waves sweep rapidly over a\r\ncornfield, while yet each cornstalk remains fixed in the ground), it\r\nwill be seen that the effects of the great sea-wave could only be\r\nperceived near the shore. Even there, as we shall presently see, there\r\nwas much to convey the impression that the land itself was rising and\r\nfalling rather than that the deep was moved. But among the hundreds of\r\nships which were sailing upon the Pacific when its length and breadth\r\nwere traversed by the great sea-wave, there was not one in which any\r\nunusual motion was perceived.\r\n\r\nIn somewhat less than three hours after the occurrence of the\r\nearthquake the ocean-wave inundated the port of Coquimbo, on the\r\nChilean seaboard, some eight hundred miles from Arica. An hour or so\r\nlater it had reached Constitucion, four hundred and fifty miles\r\nfarther south; and here for some three hours the sea rose and fell\r\nwith strange violence. Farther south, along the shore of Chile, even\r\nto the island of Chiloe, the shore-wave travelled, though with\r\ncontinually diminishing force, owing, doubtless, to the resistance\r\nwhich the irregularities of the shore opposed to its progress.\r\n\r\nThe northerly shore-wave seems to have been more considerable; and a\r\nmoment's study of a chart of the two Americas will show that this\r\ncircumstance is highly significant. When we remember that the\r\nprincipal effects of the land-shock were experienced within that angle\r\nwhich the Peruvian Andes form with the long north-and-south line of\r\nthe Chilean and Bolivian Andes, we see at once that, had the centre of\r\nthe subterranean action been near the scene where the most destructive\r\neffects were perceived, no sea-wave, or but a small one, could have\r\nbeen sent toward the shores of North America. The projecting shores of\r\nnorthern Peru and Ecuador could not have failed to divert the sea-wave\r\ntoward the west; and though a reflected wave might have reached\r\nCalifornia, it would only have been after a considerable interval of\r\ntime, and with dimensions much less than those of the sea-wave which\r\ntravelled southward. When we see that, on the contrary, a wave of even\r\ngreater proportions travelled toward the shores of North America, we\r\nseem forced to the conclusion that the centre of the subterranean\r\naction must have been so far to the west that the sea-wave generated\r\nby it had a free course to the shores of California.\r\n\r\nBe this as it may, there can be no doubt that the wave which swept the\r\nshores of Southern California, rising upward of sixty feet above the\r\nordinary sea-level, was absolutely the most imposing of all the\r\nindirect effects of the great earthquake. When we consider that even\r\nin San Pedro Bay, fully five thousand miles from the centre of\r\ndisturbance, a wave twice the height of an ordinary house rolled in\r\nwith unspeakable violence only a few hours after the occurrence of the\r\nearth-throe, we are most strikingly impressed with the tremendous\r\nenergy of the earth's movement.\r\n\r\nTurning to the open ocean, let us track the great wave on its course\r\npast the multitudinous islands which dot the surface of the Pacific.\r\n\r\nThe inhabitants of the Sandwich Islands, which lie about six thousand\r\nthree hundred miles from Arica, might have imagined themselves safe\r\nfrom any effects which could be produced by an earthquake taking place\r\nso far away from them. But on the night between August 13th and 14th,\r\nthe sea around this island group rose in a surprising manner, insomuch\r\nthat many thought the islands were sinking, and would shortly subside\r\naltogether beneath the waves. Some of the smaller islands, indeed,\r\nwere for a time completely submerged. Before long, however, the sea\r\nfell again, and as it did so the observers \"found it impossible to\r\nresist the impression that the islands were rising bodily out of the\r\nwater.\" For no less than three days this strange oscillation of the\r\nsea continued to be experienced, the most remarkable ebbs and floods\r\nbeing noticed at Honolulu, on the island of Woahoo.\r\n\r\nBut the sea-wave swept onward far beyond these islands.\r\n\r\nAt Yokohama, in Japan, more than ten thousand five hundred miles from\r\nArica, an enormous wave poured in on August 14th, but at what hour we\r\nhave no satisfactory record. So far as distance is concerned, this\r\nwave affords most surprising evidence of the stupendous nature of the\r\ndisturbance to which the waters of the Pacific Ocean had been\r\nsubjected. The whole circumference of the earth is but twenty-five\r\nthousand miles, so that this wave had travelled over a distance\r\nconsiderably greater than two-fifths of the earth's circumference. A\r\ndistance which the swiftest of our ships could not traverse in less\r\nthan six or seven weeks had been swept over by this enormous\r\nundulation in the course of a few hours.\r\n\r\nMore complete details reach us from the Southern Pacific.\r\n\r\nShortly before midnight the Marquesas Isles and the low-lying Tuamotu\r\ngroup were visited by the great wave, and some of these islands were\r\ncompletely submerged by it. The lonely Opara Isle, where the steamers\r\nwhich run between Panama and New Zealand have their coaling station,\r\nwas visited at about half-past eleven in the evening by a billow which\r\nswept away a portion of the coal depot. Afterward great waves came\r\nrolling in at intervals of about twenty minutes, and several days\r\nelapsed before the sea resumed its ordinary ebb and flow.\r\n\r\nIt was not until about half-past two on the morning of August 14th\r\nthat the Samoa Isles (sometimes called the Navigator Islands) were\r\nvisited by the great wave. The watchmen startled the inhabitants from\r\ntheir sleep by the cry that the sea was about to overwhelm them; and\r\nalready, when the terrified people rushed from their houses, the sea\r\nwas found to have risen far above the highest water-mark. But it\r\npresently began to sink again, and then commenced a series of\r\noscillations, which lasted for several days, and were of a very\r\nremarkable nature. Once in every quarter of an hour the sea rose and\r\nfell, but it was noticed that it rose twice as rapidly as it sank.\r\nThis peculiarity is well worth remarking. The eminent physicist Mallet\r\nspeaks thus (we follow Lyell's quotation) about the waves which\r\ntraverse an open sea: \"The great sea-wave, advancing at the rate of\r\nseveral miles in a minute, consists, in the deep ocean, of a long, low\r\nswell of enormous volume, having an equal slope before and behind, and\r\nthat so gentle that it might pass under a ship without being noticed.\r\nBut when it reaches the edge of soundings, its front slope becomes\r\nshort and steep, while its rear slope is long and gentle.\" On the\r\nshores visited by such a wave, the sea would appear to rise more\r\nrapidly than it sank. We have seen that this happened on the shores of\r\nthe Samoa group, and therefore the way in which the sea rose and fell\r\non the days following the great earthquake gave significant evidence\r\nof the nature of the sea-bottom in the neighborhood of these islands.\r\nAs the change of the great wave's figure could not have been quickly\r\ncommunicated, we may conclude with certainty that the Samoan Islands\r\nare the summits of lofty mountains, whose sloping sides extend far\r\ntoward the east.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion affords interesting evidence of the necessity of\r\nobserving even the seemingly trifling details of important phenomena.\r\n\r\nThe wave which visited the New Zealand Isles was altogether different\r\nin character, affording a noteworthy illustration of another remark of\r\nMallet's. He says that where the sea-bottom slopes in such a way that\r\nthere is water of some depth close inshore, the great wave may roll in\r\nand do little damage; and we have seen that so it happened in the case\r\nof the Samoan Islands. But he adds that, \"where the shore is shelving\r\nthere will be first a retreat of the water, and then the wave will\r\nbreak upon the beach and roll far in upon the land.\" This is precisely\r\nwhat happened when the great wave reached the eastern shores of New\r\nZealand, which are known to shelve down to very shallow water,\r\ncontinuing far away to sea toward the east.\r\n\r\nAt about half-past three on the morning of August 14th the water began\r\nto retreat in a singular manner from the port of Littleton, on the\r\neastern shores of the southernmost of the New Zealand Islands. At\r\nlength the whole port was left entirely dry, and so remained for about\r\ntwenty minutes. Then the water was seen returning like a wall of foam\r\nten or twelve feet in height, which rushed with a tremendous noise\r\nupon the port and town. Toward five o'clock the water again retired,\r\nvery slowly as before, not reaching its lowest ebb until six. An hour\r\nlater a second huge wave inundated the port. Four times the sea\r\nretired and returned with great power at intervals of about two hours.\r\nAfterward the oscillation of the water was less considerable, but it\r\nhad not wholly ceased until August 17th, and only on the 18th did the\r\nregular ebb and flow of the tide recommence.\r\n\r\nAround the Samoa group the water rose and fell once in every fifteen\r\nminutes, while on the shores of New Zealand each oscillation lasted no\r\nless than two hours. Doubtless the different depths of water, the\r\nirregular conformation of the island groups, and other like\r\ncircumstances, were principally concerned in producing these singular\r\nvariations. Yet they do not seem fully sufficient to account for so\r\nwide a range of difference. Possibly a cause yet unnoticed may have\r\nhad something to do with the peculiarity. In waves of such enormous\r\nextent it would be quite impossible to determine whether the course of\r\nthe wave motion was directed full upon a line of shore or more or less\r\nobliquely. It is clear that in the former case the waves would seem to\r\nfollow each other more swiftly than in the latter, even though there\r\nwere no difference in their velocity.\r\n\r\nFar on beyond the shores of New Zealand the great wave coursed,\r\nreaching at length the coast of Australia. At dawn of August 14th\r\nMoreton Bay was visited by five well-marked waves. At Newcastle, on\r\nthe Hunter River, the sea rose and fell several times in a remarkable\r\nmanner, the oscillatory motion commencing at half-past six in the\r\nmorning. But the most significant evidence of the extent to which the\r\nsea-wave travelled in this direction was afforded at Port Fairy,\r\nBelfast, South Victoria. Here the oscillation of the water was\r\ndistinctly perceived at midday on August 14th; and yet, to reach this\r\npoint, the sea-wave must not only have travelled on a circuitous\r\ncourse nearly equal in length to half the circumference of the earth,\r\nbut must have passed through Bass's Straits, between Australia and Van\r\nDiemen's Land, and so have lost a considerable portion of its force\r\nand dimensions. When we remember that had not the effects of the\r\nearth-shock on the water been limited by the shores of South America,\r\na wave of disturbance equal in extent to that which travelled westward\r\nwould have swept toward the east, we see that the force of the shock\r\nwas sufficient to have disturbed the waters of an ocean covering the\r\nwhole surface of the earth. For the sea-waves which reached Yokohama\r\nin one direction and Port Fairy in another had each traversed a\r\ndistance nearly equal to half the earth's circumference; so that if\r\nthe surface of the earth were all sea, waves setting out in opposite\r\ndirections from the centre of disturbance would have met each other at\r\nthe antipodes of their starting-point.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to contemplate the effects which followed the great\r\nearthquake--the passage of a sea-wave of enormous volume over fully\r\none third of the earth's surface, and the force with which, on the\r\nfarthermost limits of its range, the wave rolled in upon shores more\r\nthan ten thousand miles from its starting-place--without feeling that\r\nthose geologists are right who deny that the subterranean forces of\r\nthe earth are diminishing in intensity. It may be difficult, perhaps,\r\nto look on the effects which are ascribed to ancient earth-throes\r\nwithout imagining for a while that the power of modern earthquakes is\r\naltogether less. But when we consider fairly the share which time had\r\nin those ancient processes of change, when we see that while mountain\r\nranges were being upheaved or valleys depressed to their present\r\nposition, race after race, and type after type appeared on the earth,\r\nand lived out the long lives which belong to races and to types, we\r\nare recalled to the remembrance of the great work which the earth's\r\nsubterranean forces are still engaged upon. Even now continents are\r\nbeing slowly depressed or upheaved; even now mountain ranges are being\r\nraised to a new level, tablelands are in process of formation, and\r\ngreat valleys are being gradually scooped out. It may need an\r\noccasional outburst, such as the earthquake of August, 1868, to remind\r\nus that great forces are at work beneath the earth's surface. But, in\r\nreality, the signs of change have long been noted. Old shore-lines\r\nshift their place, old soundings vary; the sea advances in one place\r\nand retires in another; on every side Nature's plastic hand is at work\r\nmodelling and remodelling the earth, in order that it may always be a\r\nfit abode for those who are to dwell upon it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHOSPHORESCENT SEA\r\n\r\n(FROM STUDIES OF ANIMATED NATURE.)\r\n\r\nBY W.S. DALLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is not merely on land that this phenomenon of phosphorescence is to\r\nbe seen in living forms. Among marine animals, indeed, it is a\r\nphenomenon much more general, much more splendid, and, we may add,\r\nmuch more familiar to those who live on our coasts. There must be many\r\nin the British Isles who have never had the opportunity of seeing the\r\nlight of the glow-worm, but there can be few of those who have\r\nfrequented in summer any part of our coasts, who have never seen that\r\nbeautiful greenish light which is then so often visible, especially on\r\nour southern shores, when the water is disturbed by the blade of an\r\noar or the prow of a boat or ship. In some cases, even on our own\r\nshores, the phenomenon is much more brilliant, every rippling wave\r\nbeing crested with a line of the same peculiar light, and in warmer\r\nseas exhibitions of this kind are much more common. It is now known\r\nthat this light is due to a minute living form, to which we will\r\nafterward return.\r\n\r\nBut before going on to speak in some detail of the organisms to which\r\nthe phosphorescence of the sea is due, it will be as well to mention\r\nthat the kind of phosphorescence just spoken of is only one mode in\r\nwhich the phenomenon is exhibited on the ocean. Though sometimes the\r\nlight is shown in continuous lines whenever the surface is disturbed,\r\nat other times, and, according to M. de Quatrefages, more commonly,\r\nthe light appears only in minute sparks, which, however numerous,\r\nnever coalesce. \"In the little channel known as the Sund de Chausez,\"\r\nhe writes, \"I have seen on a dark night each stroke of the oar kindle,\r\nas it were, myriads of stars, and the wake of the craft appeared in a\r\nmanner besprinkled with diamonds.\" When such is the case the\r\nphosphorescence is due to various minute animals, especially\r\ncrustaceans; that is, creatures which, microscopically small as they\r\nare, are yet constructed more or less on the type of the lobster or\r\ncray-fish.\r\n\r\nAt other times, again, the phosphorescence is still more partial.\r\n\"Great domes of pale gold with long streamers,\" to use the eloquent\r\nwords of Professor Martin Duncan, \"move slowly along in endless\r\nsuccession; small silvery disks swim, now enlarging and now\r\ncontracting, and here and there a green or bluish gleam marks the\r\ncourse of a tiny, but rapidly rising and sinking globe. Hour after\r\nhour the procession passes by, and the fishermen hauling in their nets\r\nfrom the midst drag out liquid light, and the soft sea jellies,\r\ncrushed and torn piecemeal, shine in every clinging particle. The\r\nnight grows dark, the wind rises and is cold, and the tide changes; so\r\ndoes the luminosity of the sea. The pale spectres below the surface\r\nsink deeper, and are lost to sight, but the increasing waves are\r\ntinged here and there with green and white, and often along a line,\r\nwhere the fresh water is mixing with the salt in an estuary, there is\r\na brightness so intense that boats and shores are visible.... But if\r\nsuch sights are to be seen on the surface, what must not be the\r\nphosphorescence of the depths! Every sea-pen is glorious in its light,\r\nin fact, nearly every eight-armed Alcyonarian is thus resplendent, and\r\nthe social Pyrosoma, bulky and a free swimmer, glows like a bar of hot\r\nmetal with a white and green radiance.\"\r\n\r\nSuch accounts are enough to indicate how varied and how general a\r\nphenomenon is the phosphorescence of the sea. To take notice of one\r\ntithe of the points of interest summed up in the paragraph just quoted\r\nwould occupy many pages, and we must therefore confine the attention\r\nto a few of the most interesting facts relating to marine\r\nphosphorescence.\r\n\r\nWe will return to that form of marine luminosity to which we first\r\nreferred: what is known as the general or diffused phosphorescence of\r\nthe sea. From this mode of describing it the reader must not infer\r\nthat the surface of the ocean is ever to be seen all aglow in one\r\nsheet of continuous light. So far, at least, as was ever observed by\r\nM. de Quatrefages, who studied this phenomenon carefully and during\r\nlong periods on the coasts of Brittany and elsewhere, no light was\r\nvisible when the surface of the sea was perfectly still. On the other\r\nhand, when the sea exhibits in a high degree the phenomenon of\r\ndiffused phosphorescence no disturbance can be too slight to cause the\r\nwater to shine with that peculiar characteristic gleam. Drop but a\r\ngrain of sand upon its surface, and you will see a point of light\r\nmarking the spot where it falls, and from that point as a centre a\r\nnumber of increasing wavelets, each clearly defined by a line of\r\nlight, will spread out in circles all around.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this diffused phosphorescence was long the subject of\r\ncuriosity, and was long unknown, but more than a hundred years ago (in\r\n1764) the light was stated by M. Kigaut to proceed from a minute and\r\nvery lowly organism, now known as _Noctiluca miliaris_; and subsequent\r\nresearches have confirmed this opinion. This Noctiluca is a spherical\r\nform of not more than one-fiftieth of an inch in size, with a slight\r\ndepression or indentation at one point, marking the position of a\r\nmouth leading to a short digestive cavity, and having close beside it\r\na filament, by means of which it probably moves about. The sphere is\r\nfilled with protoplasm, in which there is a nucleus and one or more\r\ngaps, or \"vacuoles.\" Such is nearly all the structure that can be\r\ndiscerned with the aid of the microscope in this simple organism.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, this lowly form is the chief cause of that diffused\r\nphosphorescence which is sometimes seen over a wide extent of the\r\nocean. How innumerable the individuals belonging to this species must\r\ntherefore be, may be left to the imagination. Probably the Noctiluca\r\nis not rivalled in this respect even by miscroscopic unicellular algæ\r\nwhich compose the \"red snow.\"\r\n\r\nBy filtering sea-water containing Noctilucæ its light can be\r\nconcentrated, and it has been found that a few teaspoonfuls will then\r\nyield light enough to enable one to read holding a book at the\r\nordinary distance from the eyes--about ten inches.\r\n\r\nA singular and highly remarkable case of diffused marine\r\nphosphorescence was observed by Nordenskiöld during his voyage to\r\nGreenland in 1883. One dark night, when the weather was calm and the\r\nsea smooth, his vessel was steaming across a narrow inlet called the\r\nIgaliko Fjord, when the sea was suddenly observed to be illumined in\r\nthe rear of the vessel by a broad but sharply-defined band of light,\r\nwhich had a uniform, somewhat golden sheen, quite unlike the ordinary\r\nbluish-green phosphorescence of the sea. The latter kind of light was\r\ndistinctly visible at the same time in the wake of the vessel. Though\r\nthe steamer was going at the rate of from five to six miles an hour,\r\nthe remarkable sheet of light got nearer and nearer. When quite close,\r\nit appeared as if the vessel were sailing in a sea of fire or molten\r\nmetal. In the course of an hour the light passed on ahead, and\r\nultimately it disappeared in the remote horizon. The nature of this\r\nphenomenon Nordenskiöld is unable to explain; and unfortunately he had\r\nnot the opportunity of examining it with the spectroscope.\r\n\r\nIf we come now to consider the more partial phosphorescence of the\r\nsea, we find that it is due to animals belonging to almost every group\r\nof marine forms--to Echinoderms, or creatures of the sea-urchin and\r\nstar-fish type, to Annelid worm, to Medusidæ, or jelly-fish, as they\r\nare popularly called, including the \"great domes\" and the \"silvery\r\ndisks\" of the passage above quoted from Professor Martin Duncan, to\r\nTunicates, among which is the Pyrosoma, to Mollusks, Crustaceans, and\r\nin very many cases to Actinozoa, or forms belonging to the type of the\r\nsea anemone and the coral polyp.\r\n\r\nOf these we will single out only a few for more special notice.\r\n\r\nMany of the Medusidæ, or jelly-fish, possess the character of which we\r\nare speaking. In some cases the phosphorescence is spontaneous among\r\nthem, but in others it is not so; the creature requires to be\r\nirritated or stimulated in some way before it will emit the light. It\r\nis spontaneous, for example, in the _Pelagia phosphorea_, but not in\r\nthe allied _Pelagia noctiluca_, a very common form in the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nIn both of the jelly-fishes just mentioned the phosphorescence, when\r\ndisplayed at all, is on the surface of the swimming disk, and this is\r\nmost commonly the case with the whole group. Sometimes, however, the\r\nphosphorescence is specially localized. In some forms, as in\r\n_Thaumantius pilosella_ and other members of the same genus, it is\r\nseen in buds at the base of tentacles given off from the margin of the\r\nswimming-bell. In other cases it is situated in certain internal\r\norgans, as in the canals which radiate from the centre to the margin\r\nof the bell, or in the ovaries. It is from this latter seat that the\r\nphosphorescence proceeds in _Oceania pilata_, the form which gives out\r\nsuch a light that Ehrenberg compared it to a lamp-globe lighted by a\r\nflame.\r\n\r\nThe property of emitting a phosphorescent light, sometimes\r\nspontaneously and sometimes on being stimulated, is likewise\r\nexemplified in the Ctenophora, a group resembling the Medusidæ in\r\nthe jelly-like character of their bodies, but more closely allied in\r\nstructure to the Actinozoa. But we will pass over these cases in order\r\nto dwell more particularly on the remarkable tunicate known as\r\nPyrosoma, a name indicative of its phosphorescent property, being\r\nderived from two Greek words signifying fire-body. As shown in the\r\nillustration Pyrosoma is not a single creature, but is composed of a\r\nwhole colony of individuals, each of which is represented by one of\r\nthe projections on the surface of the tube, closed at one end, which\r\nthey all combine to form. The free end on the exterior contains the\r\nmouth, while there is another opening in each individual toward the\r\ninterior of the tube. Such colonies, which swim about by the alternate\r\ncontraction and dilatation of the individuals composing them, are\r\npretty common in the Mediterranean, where they may attain the length\r\nof perhaps fourteen inches, with a breadth of about three inches. In\r\nthe ocean they may reach a much greater size. Mr. Moseley, in his\r\n\"Notes of a Naturalist on the Challenger,\" mentions a giant specimen\r\nwhich he once caught in the deep-sea trawl, a specimen four feet in\r\nlength and ten inches in diameter, with \"walls of jelly about an inch\r\nin thickness.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A. PYROSOMA. B. PONITON. (Magnified.)]\r\n\r\nThe same naturalist states that the light emitted by this compound\r\nform is the most beautiful of all kinds of phosphorescence. When\r\nstimulated by a touch, or shake, or swirl of the water, it \"gives out\r\na globe of bluish light, which lasts for several seconds, as the\r\nanimal drifts past several feet beneath the surface, and then suddenly\r\ngoes out.\" He adds that on the giant specimen just referred to be\r\nwrote his name with his finger as it lay on the deck in a tub at\r\nnight, and in a few seconds he had the gratification of seeing his\r\nname come out in \"letters of fire.\"\r\n\r\nAmong mollusks, the best known instance of phosphorescence is in the\r\nrock-boring Pholas, the luminosity of which after death is mentioned\r\nby Pliny. But it is not merely after death that Pholas becomes\r\nluminous--a phenomenon perfectly familiar even in the case of many\r\nfish, especially the herring and mackerel. It was long before the\r\nluminosity of the living animal was known, but this is now a\r\nwell-ascertained fact; and Panceri, an Italian naturalist, recently\r\ndead, has been able to discover in this, as in several other marine\r\nphosphorescent forms, the precise seat of the light-giving bodies,\r\nwhich he has dissected out again and again for the sake of making\r\nexperiments in connection with this subject.\r\n\r\nA more beautiful example of a phosphorescent mollusk is presented by a\r\nsea-slug called _Phyllirhoë bucephala_. This is a creature of from one\r\nand a half to two inches in length, without a shell in the adult\r\nstage, and without even gills. It breathes only by the general surface\r\nof the body. It is common enough in the Mediterranean, but is not easy\r\nto see, as it is almost perfectly transparent, so that it cannot be\r\ndistinguished without difficulty, by day at least, from the medium in\r\nwhich it swims. By night, however, it is more easily discerned, in\r\nconsequence of its property of emitting light. When disturbed or\r\nstimulated in any way, it exhibits a number of luminous spots of\r\ndifferent sizes irregularly distributed all over it, but most thickly\r\naggregated on the upper and under parts. These phosphorescent spots,\r\nit is found, are not on the surface, but for the most part represent\r\nso many large cells which form the terminations of nerves, and are\r\nsituated underneath the transparent cuticle. The spots shine with\r\nexceptional brilliancy when the animal is withdrawn from the water and\r\nstimulated by a drop of ammonia.\r\n\r\nAmong the Annelid worms a species of _Nereis_, or sea-centipedes, has\r\nearned by its phosphorescent property the specific name of _noctiluca_\r\n(night-shining), and the same property is very beautifully shown in\r\n_Polynoë_, a near ally of the familiar sea-mouse. M. de Quatrefages\r\nspeaks with enthusiasm of the beauty of the spectacle presented by\r\nthis latter form when examined under a microscope magnifying to the\r\nextent of a hundred diameters. He then found, as he did in the great\r\nmajority of cases which he studied, that the phosphorescence was\r\nconfined to the motor muscles, and was manifested solely when these\r\nwere in the act of contracting, manifested, too, not in continuous\r\nlines along the course of the muscles, but in rows of brilliant\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nMore interesting than the Annelids, however, are the Alcyonarian\r\nActinozoa. The Actinozoa have already been described as formed on the\r\ntype of the sea-anemone and the coral polyp, that is, they are all\r\nanimals with a radiate structure, attached to one end, and having\r\ntheir only opening at the other end, which is surrounded by tentacles.\r\nIn the Alcyonarian forms belonging to this great group these tentacles\r\nare always eight in number, and fringed on both sides. Moreover, these\r\nforms are almost without exception compound. Like the Pyrosoma, they\r\nhave a common life belonging to a whole stock or colony, as well as an\r\nindividual life.\r\n\r\nNow, throughout this sub-division of the Actinozoa phosphorescence is\r\na very general phenomenon. Professor Moseley, already quoted as a\r\nnaturalist accompanying the Challenger expedition, informs us that\r\n\"all the Alcyonarians dredged by the Challenger in deep water were\r\nfound to be brilliantly phosphorescent when brought to the surface.\"\r\n\r\nAmong these Alcyonarians are the sea-pens mentioned in the quotation\r\nabove made from Professor Martin Duncan. Each sea-pen is a colony of\r\nAlcyonarians, and the name is due to the singular arrangement of the\r\nindividuals upon the common stem. This stem is supported internally by\r\na coral rod, but its outer part is composed of fleshy matter belonging\r\nto the whole colony. The lower portion of it is fixed in the muddy\r\nbottom of the sea, but the upper portion is free, and gives off a\r\nnumber of branches, on which the individual polyps are seated. The\r\nwhole colony thus has the appearance of a highly ornamental pen.\r\n\r\nThere is one British species, _Pennatula phosphorea_, which is found\r\nin tolerably deep water, and is from two to four inches in length. The\r\nspecific name again indicates the phosphorescent quality belonging to\r\nit. When irritated, it shines brilliantly, and the curious thing is\r\nthat the phosphorescence travels gradually on from polyp to polyp,\r\nstarting from the point at which the irritation is applied. If the\r\nlower part of the stem is irritated, the phosphorescence passes\r\ngradually upwards along each pair of branches in succession; but if\r\nthe top is irritated the phosphorescence will pass in the same way\r\ndownwards. When both top and bottom are irritated simultaneously two\r\nluminous currents start at once, and, meeting in the middle, usually\r\nbecome extinguished there; but on one occasion Panceri found that the\r\ntwo crossed, and each completed its course independently of the other.\r\nThose of our readers who have had opportunities of making or seeing\r\nexperiments with the sensitive plant (_Mimosa pudica_) will be\r\nreminded of the way in which, when that plant is irritated, the\r\ninfluence travels regularly on from pinnules to pinnules and pinnae to\r\npinnae.\r\n\r\nIn all the cases mentioned the phenomenon of phosphorescence is\r\nexhibited by invertebrate animals; but though rare, it is not an\r\nunknown phenomenon even in living vertebrates. In a genus of deep-sea\r\nfishes called Stomias, Gunther mentions that a \"series of\r\nphosphorescent dots run along the lower side of the head, body, and\r\ntail.\" Several other deep-sea fishes, locally phosphorescent, seem to\r\nhave been dredged up by the French ship Talisman in its exploring\r\ncruise off the west coast of Northern Africa in 1883. During the same\r\nexpedition, a number of deep-sea phosphorescent crustaceans were\r\ndredged up, the phosphorescence being in some cases diffused over the\r\nwhole body, in other cases localized to particular areas. In deep-sea\r\nforms the phenomenon is, in fact, so common, as to have given rise to\r\nthe theory that in the depths of the ocean, where the light of the\r\nsun cannot penetrate, the phosphorescence of various organisms diffuse\r\na light which limits the domain of absolute darkness.\r\n\r\nSo much by way of illustration regarding the phosphorescence exhibited\r\nby animals, terrestrial and marine; but it ought to be noticed that\r\nthere are also a few cases in which the same phenomenon is to be\r\nwitnessed in plants. These are not so numerous as was at one time\r\nsupposed, the property having been mistakenly ascribed to some plants\r\nnot really luminous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PHOSPHORESCENT SEA.]\r\n\r\nIn some instances the mistake appears to have been due to a subjective\r\neffect produced by brilliantly colored (red or orange) flowers, such\r\nas the great Indian cress, the orange lily, the sunflower, and the\r\nmarigold. The fact that such flowers do give out in the dusk sudden\r\nflashes of light has often been stated on the authority of a daughter\r\nof Linnæus, subsequently backed by the assertions of various other\r\nobservers. But most careful observers seem to be agreed that the\r\nsupposed flashes of light are in reality nothing else than a certain\r\ndazzling of the eyes.\r\n\r\nIn another case, in which a moss, _Schistostega osmundacea_, has been\r\nstated to be phosphorescent, the effect is said to be really due to\r\nthe refraction and reflection of light by minute crystals scattered\r\nover its highly cellular leaves, and not to be produced at all where\r\nthe darkness is complete.\r\n\r\nAmong plants, genuine phosphorescence is to be found chiefly in\r\ncertain fungi, the most remarkable of which is _Rhizomorpha\r\nsubterranea_, which is sometimes to be seen ramifying over the walls\r\nof dark, damp mines, caverns, or decayed towers, and emitting at\r\nnumerous points a mild phosphorescent light, which is sometimes bright\r\nenough to allow of surrounding objects being distinguished by it. The\r\nname of \"vegetable glow-worm\" has sometimes been applied to this\r\ncurious growth.\r\n\r\nAmong other phosphorescent fungi are several species of Agaricus,\r\nincluding the _A. olearius_ of Europe, _A. Gardneri_ of Brazil, and\r\n_A. lampas_ of Australia, and besides the members of this genus,\r\n_Thelaphora cærulea_, which is the cause of the phosphorescent light\r\nsometimes to be seen on decaying wood--the \"touchwood\" which many boys\r\nhave kept in the hope of seeing this light displayed. The milky juice\r\nof a South American Euphorbia (_E. phosphorea_) is stated by Martins\r\nto be phosphorescent when gently heated. But phosphorescence is\r\nevidently not so interesting and important a phenomenon in the\r\nvegetable as it is in the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe whole phenomenon is one that gives rise to a good many questions\r\nwhich it is not easy to answer, and this is especially true in the\r\ncase of animal phosphorescence. What is the nature of the light? What\r\nare the conditions under which it is manifested? What purpose does it\r\nserve in the animal economy?\r\n\r\nAs to the nature of the light, the principal question is whether it is\r\na direct consequence of the vital activity of the organism in which it\r\nis seen, of such a nature that no further explanation can be given of\r\nit, any more than we can explain why a muscle is contracted under the\r\ninfluence of a nerve-stimulus; or whether it is due to some chemical\r\nprocess more or less analogous to the burning of a candle.\r\n\r\nThe fact of luminosity appearing to be in certain cases directly under\r\nthe control of the creature in which it is found, and the fact of its\r\nbeing manifested in many forms, as M. de Quatrefages found, only when\r\nmuscular contraction was taking place, would seem to favor the former\r\nview. On the other hand, it is against this view that the\r\nphosphorescence is often found to persist after the animal is dead,\r\nand even in the phosphorescent organs for a considerable time after\r\nthey have been extracted from the body of the animal. In the glow-worm\r\nthe light goes on shining for some time after the death of the insect,\r\nand even when it has become completely extinguished it can be restored\r\nfor a time by the application of a little moisture. Further, both\r\nMatteucci and Phipson found that when the luminous substance was\r\nextracted from the insect it would keep on glowing for thirty or forty\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nIn Pholas the light is still more persistent, and it is found that\r\nwhen the dead body of this mollusk is placed in honey, it will retain\r\nfor more than a year the power of emitting light when plunged in warm\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe investigations of recent years have rendered it more and more\r\nprobable that the light exhibited by phosphorescent organisms is due\r\nto a chemical process somewhat analogous to that which goes on in the\r\nburning of a candle. This latter process is one of rapid oxidation.\r\nThe particles of carbon supplied by the oily matter that feeds the\r\ncandle become so rapidly combined with oxygen derived from the air\r\nthat a considerable amount of light, along with heat, is produced\r\nthereby. Now, the phenomenon of phosphorescence in organic forms,\r\nwhether living or dead, appears also to be due to a process of\r\noxidation, but one that goes on much more slowly than in the case of a\r\nlighted candle. It is thus more closely analogous to what is observed\r\nin the element phosphorus itself, which owes its name (meaning\r\n\"light-bearer\") to the fact that when exposed to the air at ordinary\r\ntemperatures it glows in the dark, in consequence of its becoming\r\nslowly combined with oxygen.\r\n\r\nAt one time it was believed that the presence of oxygen was not\r\nnecessary to the exhibition of phosphorescence in organic forms, but\r\nit has now been placed beyond doubt that this is a mistake. Oxygen has\r\nbeen proved to be indispensable, and hence we see a reason for the\r\nluminous organs in the glow-worm being so intimately connected, as\r\nabove mentioned, with the air-tubes that ramify through the insect.\r\n\r\nThis fact of itself might be taken as a strong indication of the\r\nchemical nature of the process to which phosphorescence is due. But\r\nthe problem has been made the subject of further investigations which\r\nhave thrown more light upon it. It was long known that there were\r\nvarious inorganic bodies besides phosphorus which emitted a\r\nphosphorescent light in the dark, at least after being exposed to the\r\nrays of the sun; but it was not till quite recently that any organic\r\ncompound was known to phosphoresce at ordinary temperatures.\r\n\r\nThis discovery was made by a Polish chemist, named Bronislaus\r\nRadziszewski, who followed it up with a long series of experiments on\r\nthe phosphorescence of organic compounds, by which he was able to\r\ndetermine the conditions under which that phenomenon was exhibited. In\r\nall the substances investigated by him in which phosphorescence was\r\nintroduced he found that three conditions were essential to its\r\nproduction: (1) that oxygen should be present; (2) that there should\r\nbe an alkaline reaction in the phosphorescing mixture--that is, a\r\nreaction such as is produced on acids and vegetable coloring matters\r\nby potash, soda, and the other alkalies; and (3) that some kind of\r\nchemical action should take place.\r\n\r\nHe found, moreover, that among the organic compounds that could be\r\nmade to phosphoresce under these conditions were nearly all the fixed\r\nand ethereal oils. With reference to the phosphorescence of animals,\r\nthis observation is important, for it has been shown in a great many\r\ncases that a fatty substance forms the main constituent in their\r\nluminous organs. This has long been known to be the case in the\r\nluminous insects belonging to the Lampyridæ and Elateridæ, as well as\r\nin the luminous centipedes; and the researches of Panceri, already\r\nreferred to, on the luminous organs of many marine forms have shown\r\nthat it holds good with regard to these also.\r\n\r\nWe may, therefore, conclude that substances fitted to phosphoresce\r\nunder the conditions determined by the experiments of Radziszewski are\r\ngenerally, and probably universally, present in the luminous organs of\r\nphosphorescent animals. Now, what is to be said as to the occurrence\r\nof these conditions? The access of oxygen is in all cases easy to\r\naccount for, but it must also be shown how the alkaline reaction is to\r\nbe produced. We need not expect to find in animal organisms potash,\r\nsoda, ammonia, and the other common alkalies; but it was established\r\nby experiment that the alkaline organic compounds cholin and neurin,\r\nwhich are present in animal tissues, would also serve to bring about\r\nthe phenomenon of phosphorescence in the substances on which the\r\nexperiments were made.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, it seems fair to conclude that when all these conditions\r\nfor the production of phosphorescence in a chemical laboratory are\r\npresent in animal organisms, the phenomenon, when observed in these,\r\nis exactly of the same nature as that which is produced artificially.\r\nBy that it is meant that animal phosphorescence is attended, like the\r\nartificial phenomenon, by a slow chemical action, or in other words,\r\nthat the phosphorescent light is due to a gradual process of\r\noxidation.\r\n\r\nOne curious circumstance has been discovered which lends still further\r\nprobability to this explanation. It was mentioned above that among\r\nphosphorescent plants there are several species of Agaricus. Now,\r\nfrom one species of this genus, though not indeed one of the\r\nphosphorescent species (from _A. muscarius_) there has been extracted\r\na principle called _amanitia_, which is found to be identical with\r\ncholin. In the light of the results derived from the investigations\r\njust referred to it is reasonable to draw the conclusion that, if\r\nsought for, this principle would likewise be found in the\r\nphosphorescent species in which the other conditions of\r\nphosphorescence are also present.\r\n\r\nOn this theory of the production of the phenomenon now under\r\nconsideration, the effect of shaking or of vital action in giving rise\r\nto or intensifying the exhibition of the light is accounted for by the\r\nfact that by these means fresh supplies of oxygen are brought into\r\ncontact with the phosphorescent substance. The effect of ammonia on\r\nthe light emitted by the sea-slug _Phyllirhoë bucephala_, is also\r\nfully explained, ammonia being one of those alkaline substances which\r\nare so directly favorable to the exhibition of the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nNor is it difficult to account for the control which in some cases\r\ninsects appear to have over the luminosity of the phosphorescent\r\norgans, exhibiting and withdrawing the light at will. It is not\r\nnecessary to suppose that this is an immediate effect, a conversion of\r\nnerve force into light, and a withdrawal of that force. The action of\r\nthe creature's will may be merely in maintaining or destroying the\r\nconditions under which the light is manifested. It may, for example,\r\nhave the power of withdrawing the supply of oxygen, and this\r\nsupposition receives some countenance from the observation cited from\r\nKirby and Spence on the two captured glow-worms, one of which\r\nwithdrew its light, while the other kept it shining, but while doing\r\nso had the posterior extremity of the abdomen in constant motion. But\r\nthe animal may also have the power in another way of affecting the\r\nchemical conditions of the phenomenon. It may, for example, have the\r\npower of increasing or diminishing by some nervous influence the\r\nsupply of the necessary alkaline ingredient.\r\n\r\nBut if animal phosphorescence is really due to a process of slow\r\noxidation, there is one singular circumstance to be noted in\r\nconnection with it. Oxidation is a process that is normally\r\naccompanied by the development of heat. Even where no light is\r\nproduced an increase of temperature regularly takes place when\r\nsubstances are oxidized. We ought, then, to expect such a rise of\r\ntemperature when light is emitted by the phosphorescent organs of\r\nanimals. But the most careful observations have shown that nothing of\r\nthe kind can be detected. It was with a view to test this that Panceri\r\ndissected out the luminous organs of so many specimens of Pholas. He\r\nselected this mollusk because it was so abundant in the neighborhood\r\nof Naples, where, his experiments were made; and in making his\r\nexperiments he made use of a thermopile, an apparatus by which, with\r\nthe aid of electricity, much smaller quantities of heat can be\r\nindicated than by means of the most delicate thermometer. The organs\r\nremained luminous long after they were extracted, but no rise in\r\ntemperature whatever could be found to accompany the luminosity. Many\r\nexperiments upon different animals were made with similar negative\r\nresults by means of the thermometer.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation of this that can be given is probably to be found\r\nin the fact that the chemical process ascertained to go on in the\r\nphosphorescence of organic compounds on which experiments were made in\r\nthe laboratory is an extremely slow one.\r\n\r\nThe so-called phosphorescence of most inorganic bodies is one of a\r\ntotally different nature from that exhibited in organic forms. The\r\ndiamond shines for a time in the dark after it has been exposed to the\r\nsun; so do pieces of quartz when rubbed together, and powdered\r\nfluor-spar when heated shines with considerable brilliancy. Various\r\nartificial compounds, such as sulphide of calcium (Canton's\r\nphosphorus, as it is called from the discoverer), sulphate of barium\r\n(Bologna stone, or Bologna phosphorus), sulphide of strontium, etc.,\r\nafter being illuminated by the rays of the sun, give out in the dark a\r\nbeautiful phosphorescence, green, blue, violet, orange, red, according\r\nto circumstances. The luminous paint which has recently attracted so\r\nmuch attention is of the same nature. In these cases what we have is\r\neither a conversion of heat rays into light rays (as in the powdered\r\nfluor-spar), or the absorption and giving out again of sun-rays. In\r\nthe latter case the phenomenon is essentially the same as\r\nfluorescence, in which the dark rays of the solar spectrum beyond the\r\nviolet are made visible.\r\n\r\nBut we must now return to the other questions that have been started\r\nin relation to phosphorescence in animals. There has been much\r\nspeculation as to the object of this light, and to the purposes it\r\nserves in Nature. Probably no general answer can be given to this\r\nquestion. It is no doubt impossible to show why so many animals have\r\nbeen endowed with this remarkable property; but we may consider some\r\nof the effects which the possession of it has in different cases.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it will undoubtedly serve in many cases to afford\r\nlight to enable the animal to see by, and in the Lampyridæ it would\r\nseem that the degree of luminosity is related to the development of\r\nthe vision. In that family, according to the Rev. H.S. Gorham, the\r\neyes are developed, as a rule, in inverse proportion to the\r\nluminosity. Where there is an ample supply of this kind of light the\r\neyes are small, but where the light is insignificant the eyes are\r\nlarge by way of compensation. And moreover, where both eyes and light\r\nare small, then the antennae are large and feathery, so that the\r\ndeficiency in the sense of sight is made up for by an unusual\r\ndevelopment in the organs of touch.\r\n\r\nBut it is none the less certain that the presence of this light cannot\r\nalways be designed to serve this purpose, for many of the animals so\r\nendowed are blind. The phosphorescent centipedes are without eyes,\r\nlike all the other members of the genus (_Geophilus_) to which they\r\nbelong, and probably the majority of phosphorescent marine forms are\r\nlikewise destitute of organs of sight.\r\n\r\nAnother suggestion is that the light derived from these marine forms,\r\nand especially from deep-sea Alcyonarians, is what enables the members\r\nof the deep-sea fauna that are possessed of eyes (which are always\r\nenormously enlarged) to see. Such is the suggestion of Dr. Carpenter,\r\nSir Wyville Thomson, and Mr. Gwyn Jeffries; and it is possible that\r\nthis actually is one of the effects of the phosphorescent property.\r\nBut if so, it remains to inquire how the forms endowed with it came\r\nto be possessed of a power useful in that way to other forms, but not\r\nto themselves. According to the Darwinian doctrine of development, the\r\npowers that are developed in different organisms by the process of\r\nnatural selection are such as are useful to themselves and not to\r\nothers, unless incidentally.\r\n\r\nThis consideration has led to another suggestion, namely, that the\r\nproperty of phosphorescence serves as a protection to the forms\r\npossessing it, driving away enemies in one way or another: it may be\r\nby warning them of the fact that they are unpalatable food, as is\r\nbelieved to be the case with the colors of certain brilliantly-colored\r\ncaterpillars; it may be in other ways. In Kirby and Spence one case is\r\nrecorded in which the phosphorescence of the common phosphorescent\r\ncentipede (_Geophilus electricus_) was actually seen apparently to\r\nserve as a means of defence against an enemy. \"Mr. Shepherd,\" says\r\nthat authority, \"once noticed a scarabeus running round the\r\nlast-mentioned insect when shining, as if wishing, but afraid to\r\nattack it.\" In the case of the jelly-fishes, it has been pointed out\r\nthat their well-known urticating or stinging powers would make them at\r\nleast unpleasant, if not dangerous, food for fishes; and that\r\nconsequently the luminosity by which so many of them are characterized\r\nat night may serve at once as a warning to predatory fishes and as a\r\nprotection to themselves. The experience of the unpleasant properties\r\nof many phosphorescent animals may likewise have taught fishes to\r\navoid all forms possessing this attribute, even though many of them\r\nmight be quite harmless.\r\n\r\nLastly, it has been suggested that the phosphorescence in the female\r\nglow-worm may be designed to attract the male; and that it will\r\nactually have this effect may readily be taken for granted.\r\nObservation shows that the male glow-worm is very apt to be attracted\r\nby a light. Gilbert White of Selborne mentions that they, attracted by\r\nthe light of the candles, came into his parlor. Another observer\r\nstates that by the same light he captured as many as forty male\r\nglow-worms in one night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMETS\r\n\r\n(FROM MARVELS OF THE HEAVENS.)\r\n\r\nBY CAMILLE FLAMMARION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Je viens vous annoncer une grande nouvelle:\r\n  Nous l'avons, en dormant, madame, échappé belle.\r\n  Un monde près de nous a passé tout du long,\r\n  Est chu tout au travers de notre tourbillon;\r\n  Et s'il eût en chemin rencontré notre terre,\r\n  Elle eût été brisée en morceaux comme verre.\"\r\n                                           MOLIÈRE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis announcement of Trissontin's to Philaminte, who begins the parody\r\non the fears caused by the appearance of comets, would not have been a\r\nparody four or five centuries ago. These tailed bodies, which suddenly\r\ncome to light up the heavens, were for long regarded with terror, like\r\nso many warning signs of divine wrath. Men have always thought\r\nthemselves much more important than they really are in the universal\r\norder; they have had the vanity to pretend that the whole creation was\r\nmade for them, whilst in reality the whole creation does not suspect\r\ntheir existence. The Earth we inhabit is only one of the smallest\r\nworlds; and therefore it can scarcely be for it alone that all the\r\nwonders of the heavens, of which the immense majority remains hidden\r\nfrom it, were created. In this disposition of man to see in himself\r\nthe centre and the end of everything, it was easy indeed to consider\r\nthe steps of nature as unfolded in his favor; and if some unusual\r\nphenomenon presented itself, it was considered to be without doubt a\r\nwarning from Heaven. If these illusions had had no other result than\r\nthe amelioration of the more timorous of the community one would\r\nregret these ages of ignorance; but not only were these fancied\r\nwarnings of no use, seeing that once the danger passed, man returned\r\nto his former state; but they also kept up among people imaginary\r\nterrors, and revived the fatal resolutions caused by the fear of the\r\nend of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen one fancies the world is about to end,--and this has been\r\nbelieved for more than a thousand years,--no solicitude is felt in the\r\nwork of improving this world; and, by the indifference or disdain into\r\nwhich one falls, periods of famine and general misery are induced\r\nwhich at certain times have overtaken our community. Why use the\r\nwealth of a world which is going to perish? Why work, be instructed,\r\nor rise in the progress of the sciences or arts? Much better to forget\r\nthe world, and absorb one's self in the barren contemplation of an\r\nunknown life. It is thus that ages of ignorance weigh on man, and\r\nthrust him further and further into darkness, while Science makes\r\nknown by its influence on the whole community, its great value, and\r\nthe magnitude of its aim.\r\n\r\nThe history of a comet would be an instructive episode of the great\r\nhistory of the heavens. In it could be brought together the\r\ndescription of the progressive movement of human thought, as well as\r\nthe astronomical theory of these extraordinary bodies. Let us take,\r\nfor example, one of the most memorable and best-known comets, and give\r\nan outline of its successive passages near the Earth. Like the\r\nplanetary worlds, Comets belong to the solar system, and are subject\r\nto the rule of the Star King. It is the universal law of gravitation\r\nwhich guides their path; solar attraction governs them, as it governs\r\nthe movement of the planets and the small satellites. The chief point\r\nof difference between them and the planets is, that their orbits are\r\nvery elongated; and, instead of being nearly circular, they take the\r\nelliptical form. In consequence of the nature of these orbits, the\r\nsame comet may approach very near the Sun, and afterwards travel from\r\nit to immense distances. Thus, the period of the Comet of 1680 has\r\nbeen estimated at three thousand years. It approaches the Sun, so as\r\nto be nearer to it than our Moon is to us, whilst it recedes to a\r\ndistance 853 times greater than the distance of the Earth from the\r\nSun. On the 17th of December, 1680, it was at its perihelion--that is,\r\nat its greatest proximity to the Sun; it is now continuing its path\r\nbeyond the Neptunian orbit. Its velocity varies according to its\r\ndistance from the solar body. At its perihelion it travels thousands\r\nof leagues per minute; at its aphelion it does not pass over more than\r\na few yards. Its proximity to the Sun in its passage near that body\r\ncaused Newton to think that it received a heat twenty-eight thousand\r\ntimes greater than that we experience at the summer solstice; and\r\nthat this heat being two thousand times greater than that of red-hot\r\niron, an iron globe of the same dimensions would be fifty thousand\r\nyears entirely losing its heat. Newton added that in the end comets\r\nwill approach so near the Sun that they will not be able to escape the\r\npreponderance of its attraction, and that they will fall one after the\r\nother into this brilliant body, thus keeping up the heat which it\r\nperpetually pours out into space. Such is the deplorable end assigned\r\nto comets by the author of the \"Principia,\" an end which makes De la\r\nBrétonne say to Rétif: \"An immense comet, already larger than Jupiter,\r\nwas again increased in its path by being blended with six other dying\r\ncomets. Thus displaced from its ordinary route by these slight shocks,\r\nit did not pursue its true elliptical orbit; so that the unfortunate\r\nthing was precipitated into the devouring centre of the Sun.\" \"It is\r\nsaid,\" added he, \"that the poor comet, thus burned alive, sent forth\r\ndreadful cries!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A COMET]\r\n\r\nIt will be interesting, then, in a double point of view, to follow a\r\ncomet in its different passages in sight of the Earth. Let us take the\r\nmost important in astronomical history--the one whose orbit has been\r\ncalculated by Edmund Halley, and which was named after him. It was in\r\n1682 that this comet appeared in its greatest brilliancy, accompanied\r\nwith a tail which did not measure less than thirty-two millions of\r\nmiles. By the observation of the path which it described in the\r\nheavens, and the time it occupied in describing it, this astronomer\r\ncalculated its orbit, and recognized that the comet was the same as\r\nthat which was admired in 1531 and 1607, and which ought to have\r\nreappeared in 1759. Never did scientific prediction excite a more\r\nlively interest. The comet returned at the appointed time; and on the\r\n12th of March, 1759, reached its perihelion. Since the year 12 before\r\nthe Christian era, it had presented itself twenty-four times to the\r\nEarth. It was principally from the astronomical annals of China that\r\nit was possible to follow it up to this period.\r\n\r\nIts first memorable appearance in the history of France is that of\r\n837, in the reign of Louis le Débonnaire. An anonymous writer of\r\nchronicles of that time, named \"The Astronomer,\" gave the following\r\ndetails of this appearance, relative to the influence of the comet on\r\nthe imperial imagination:\r\n\r\n\"During the holy days of the solemnization of Easter, a phenomenon\r\never fatal, and of gloomy foreboding, appeared in the heavens. As soon\r\nas the Emperor, who paid attention to these phenomena, received the\r\nfirst announcement of it, he gave himself no rest until he had called\r\na certain learned man and myself before him. As soon as I arrived, he\r\nanxiously asked me what I thought of such a sign; I asked time of him,\r\nin order to consider the aspects of the stars, and to discover the\r\ntruth by their means, promising to acquaint him on the morrow; but the\r\nEmperor, persuaded that I wished to gain time, which was true, in\r\norder not to be obliged to announce anything fatal to him, said to me:\r\n'Go on the terrace of the palace and return at once to tell me what\r\nyou have seen, for I did not see this star last evening, and you did\r\nnot point it out to me; but I know that it is a comet; tell me what\r\nyou think it announces to me.' Then scarcely allowing me time to say\r\na word, he added: 'There is still another thing you keep back; it is\r\nthat a change of reign and the death of a prince are announced by this\r\nsign.' And as I advanced the testimony of the prophet, who said: 'Fear\r\nnot the signs of the heavens as the nations fear them,' the prince\r\nwith his grand nature, and the wisdom which never forsook him, said,\r\n'We must not only fear Him who has created both us and this star. But\r\nas this phenomenon may refer to us, let us acknowledge it as a warning\r\nfrom Heaven.\"\r\n\r\nLouis le Débonnaire gave himself and his court to fasting and prayer,\r\nand built churches and monasteries. He died three years later, in 840,\r\nand historians have profited by this slight coincidence to prove that\r\nthe appearance of the comet was a harbinger of death. The historian,\r\nRaoul Glader, added later: \"These phenomena of the universe are never\r\npresented to man without surely announcing some wonderful and terrible\r\nevent.\"\r\n\r\nHalley's comet again appeared in April, 1066, at the moment when\r\nWilliam the Conqueror invaded England. It was pretended that it had\r\nthe greatest influence on the fate of the battle of Hastings, which\r\ndelivered over the country to the Normans.\r\n\r\nA contemporary poet, alluding probably to the English diadem with\r\nwhich William was crowned, had proclaimed in one place, \"that the\r\ncomet had been more favorable to William than nature had been to\r\nCaesar; the latter had no hair, but William had received some from the\r\ncomet.\" A monk of Malmesbury apostrophized the comet in these terms:\r\n\"Here thou art again, thou cause of the tears of many mothers! It is\r\nlong since I have seen thee, but I see thee now, more terrible than\r\never; thou threatenest my country with complete ruin!\"\r\n\r\nIn 1455, the same comet made a more memorable appearance still. The\r\nTurks and Christians were at war, the West and the East seemed armed\r\nfrom head to foot--on the point of annihilating each other. The\r\ncrusade undertaken by Pope Calixtus III. against the invading\r\nSaracens, was waged with redoubled ardor on the sudden appearance of\r\nthe star with the flaming tail. Mahomet II. took Constantinople by\r\nstorm, and raised the siege of Belgrade. But the Pope having put aside\r\nboth the curse of the comet, and the abominable designs of the\r\nMussulmans, the Christians gained the battle, and vanquished their\r\nenemies in a bloody fight. The _Angelus_ to the sound of bells dates\r\nfrom these ordinances of Calixtus III. referring to the comet.\r\n\r\nIn his poem on astronomy, Daru, of the French Academy, describes this\r\nepisode in eloquent terms:\r\n\r\n  \"Un autre Mahomet a-t-il d'un bras puissant\r\n  Aux murs de Constantine arboré le croissant:\r\n  Le Danube étonné se trouble au bruit des armes,\r\n  La Grèce est dans les fers, l'Europe est en alarmes;\r\n  Et pour comble d'horreur, l'astre au visage ardent\r\n  De ses ailes de feu va couvrir l'Occident.\r\n  Au pied de ses autels, qu'il ne saurait défendre,\r\n  Calixte, l'oeil en pleurs, le front convert de cendre,\r\n  Conjure la comète, objet de tant d'effroi:\r\n  Regarde vers les cieux, pontife, et lève-toi!\r\n  L'astre poursuit sa course, et le fer d'Huniade\r\n  Arrête le vainqueur, qui tombe sous Belgrade.\r\n  Dans les cieux cependant le globe suspendu,\r\n  Par la loi générale à jamais retenu,\r\n  Ignore les terreurs, l'existence de Rome,\r\n  Et la Terre peut-être, et jusqu'au nom de l'homme,\r\n  De l'homme, être crédule, atome ambitieux,\r\n  Qui tremble sous un prêtre et qui lit dans les cieux.\"\r\n\r\nThis ancient comet witnessed many revolutions in human history, at\r\neach of its appearances, even in its later ones, in 1682, 1759, 1835;\r\nit was also presented to the Earth under the most diverse aspects,\r\npassing through a great variety of forms, from the appearance of a\r\ncurved sabre, as in 1456, to that of a misty head, as in its last\r\nvisit. Moreover, this is not an exception to the general rule, for\r\nthese mysterious stars have had the gift of exercising a power on the\r\nimagination which plunged it in ecstasy or trouble. Swords of fire,\r\nbloody crosses, flaming daggers, spears, dragons, fish, and other\r\nappearances of the same kind, were given to them in the middle ages\r\nand the Renaissance.\r\n\r\nComets like those of 1577 appear, moreover, to justify by their\r\nstrange form the titles with which they are generally greeted. The\r\nmost serious writers were not free from this terror. Thus, in a\r\nchapter on celestial monsters, the celebrated surgeon, Ambroise Paré,\r\ndescribed the comet of 1528 under the most vivid and frightful colors:\r\n\"This comet was so horrible and dreadful that it engendered such great\r\nterror to the people, that they died, some with fear, others with\r\nillness. It appeared to be of immense length, and of blood color; at\r\nits head was seen the figure of a curved arm, holding a large sword in\r\nthe hand as if it wished to strike. At the point of the sword there\r\nwere three stars, and on either side was seen a great number of\r\nhatchets, knives, and swords covered with blood, amongst which were\r\nnumerous hideous human faces, with bristling beards and hair.\"\r\n\r\nThe imagination has good eyes when it exerts itself. The great and\r\nstrange variety of cometary aspects is described with exactitude by\r\nFather Souciet in his Latin poem on comets. \"Most of them,\" says he,\r\n\"shine with fires interlaced like thick hair, and from this they have\r\ntaken the name of comets. One draws after it the twisted folds of a\r\nlong tail; another appears to have a white and bushy beard; this one\r\nthrows a glimmer similar to that of a lamp burning during the night;\r\nthat one, O Titan! represents thy resplendent face; and this other, O\r\nPhoebe! the form of thy nascent horns. There are some which bristle\r\nwith twisted serpents. Shall I speak of those armies which have\r\nsometimes appeared in the air? of those clouds which follow as it were\r\nalong a circle, or which resemble the head of Medusa? Have there not\r\noften been seen figures of men or savage animals?\r\n\r\n\"Often, in the gloom of night, lighted up by these sad fires, the\r\nhorrible sound of arms is heard, the clashing of swords which meet in\r\nthe clouds, the ether furiously resounding with fearful din which\r\ncrush the people with terror. All comets have a melancholy light, but\r\nthey have not all the same color. Some have a leaden color; others\r\nthat of flame or brass. The fires of some have the redness of blood;\r\nothers resemble the brightness of silver. Some again are azure; others\r\nhave the dark and pale color of iron. These differences come from the\r\ndiversity of the vapors which surround them, or from the different\r\nmanner in which they receive the Sun's rays. Do you not see in our\r\nfires, that various kinds of wood produce different colors? Pines and\r\nfirs give a flame mixed with thick smoke, and throw out little light.\r\nThat which rises from sulphur and thick bitumen is bluish. Lighted\r\nstraw gives out sparks of a reddish color. The large olive, laurel,\r\nash of Parnassus, etc., trees which always retain their sap, throw a\r\nwhitish light similar to that of a lamp. Thus, comets whose fires are\r\nformed of different materials, each take and preserve a color which is\r\npeculiar to them.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of being a cause of fear and terror, the variety and\r\nvariability of the aspect of comets ought rather to indicate to us the\r\nharmlessness of their nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TOTAL SOLAR ECLIPSE OF 1883\r\n\r\n_AN ASTRONOMERS VOYAGE TO FAIRY-LAND._\r\n\r\n(FROM THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY, MAY, 1890.)\r\n\r\nBY PROF. E.S. HOLDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn 1883 calculations showed that a solar eclipse of unusually long\r\nduration (5 minutes, 20 seconds) would occur in the South Pacific\r\nOcean. The track of the eclipse lay south of the equator, but north of\r\nTahiti. There were in fact only two dots of coral islands on the\r\ncharts in the line of totality, Caroline Island, and one hundred and\r\nfifty miles west Flint Island (longitude 150 west, latitude 10 south).\r\nAlmost nothing was known of either of these minute points. The station\r\nof the party under my charge (sent out by the United States government\r\nunder the direction of the National Academy of Sciences) was to be\r\nCaroline Islands.\r\n\r\nEvery inch of that island (seven miles long, a mile or so broad) is\r\nfamiliar now; but it is almost ludicrous to recollect with what\r\nanxiety we pored over the hydrographic charts and sailing instructions\r\nof the various nations, to find some information, however scanty,\r\nabout the spot which was to be our home for nearly a month. All that\r\nwas known was that this island had formerly been occupied as a guano\r\nstation. There was a landing _then_.\r\n\r\nAfter the _personnel_ of the party had been decided on, there were the\r\npreparations for its subsistence to be looked out for. How to feed\r\nseventeen men for twenty-one days? Fortunately the provisions that we\r\ntook, and the fresh fish caught for us by the natives, just sufficed\r\nto carry us through with comfort and with health.\r\n\r\nIn March of 1883 we sailed from New York, and about the same time a\r\nFrench expedition left Europe bound for the same spot. From New York\r\nto Panama, from Panama to Lima, were our first steps. Here we joined\r\nthe United States steamship Hartford, Admiral Farragut's flagship, and\r\nthe next day set sail for our destined port,--if a coral reef\r\nsurrounded by a raging surf can be called a port. About the same time\r\na party of French observers under Monsieur Janssen, of the Paris\r\nAcademy of Sciences, left Panama in the _Eclaireur_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF THE CAROLINE ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nIt was an ocean race of four thousand miles due west. The station\r\nCaroline Islands was supposed to be more desirable than Flint Island.\r\nAdmiral Wilkes's expedition had lain off the latter several days\r\nwithout being able to land on account of the tremendous surf, so that\r\nit was eminently desirable to \"beat the Frenchman,\" as the sailors put\r\nit. With this end in view our party had secured (through a member of\r\nthe National Academy in Washington) the verbal promise of the proper\r\nofficial of the Navy Department that the Hartford's orders should read\r\n\"to burn coal as necessary.\" The last obstacle to success was thus\r\nremoved. We were all prepared, and now the ship would take us speedily\r\nto our station.\r\n\r\nImagine our feelings the next day after leaving Callao, when the\r\ncommanding officer of the Hartford opened his sealed orders. They read\r\n(dated Washington, in February), \"To arrive at Caroline Islands (in\r\nApril) with full coal-bunkers!\"\r\n\r\nOfficialism could go no further. Here was an expedition sent on a\r\nslow-sailing ship directly through the regions of calms for four\r\nthousand miles. It was of no possible use to send the expedition at\r\nall unless it arrived in time. And here were our orders \"to arrive\r\nwith full coal-bunkers.\"\r\n\r\nFortunately we had unheard-of good-luck. The trade-wind blew for us as\r\nit did for the Ancient Mariner, and we sped along the parallel of 12°\r\nsouth at the rate of one hundred and fifty miles a day under sail,\r\nwhile the _Eclaireur_ was steaming for thirty days a little nearer the\r\nequator in a dead calm. We arrived off the island just in time, with\r\nnot a day to spare. It was a narrow escape, and a warning to all of us\r\nnever to sail again under sealed orders unless we knew what was under\r\nthe seal.\r\n\r\nHere we were, then, lying off the island and scanning its sparse crown\r\nof cocoanut palms, looking for a French flag among their wavy tufts.\r\nThere was none in sight. We were the winners in the long race.\r\nDirectly a whale-boat was lowered, and rowed around the white fringe\r\nof tremendous surf that broke ceaselessly against the vertical wall of\r\ncoral rock. There was just one narrow place where the waves rolled\r\ninto a sort of cleft and did not break. Here was the \"landing,\" then.\r\n\r\nLanding was an acrobatic feat. In you went on the crest of a wave,\r\npointing for the place where the blue seas did not break into white.\r\nAn instant after, you were in the quiet water inside of the surf. Jump\r\nout everybody and hold the boat! Then it was pick up the various\r\ninstruments, and carry them for a quarter of a mile to high-water mark\r\nand beyond, over the sharp points of the reef.\r\n\r\nIn one night we were fairly settled; in another the Hartford had\r\nsailed away, leaving us in our fairy paradise, where the corals and\r\nthe fish were of all the brilliant hues of the rainbow, and where the\r\nwhiteness of the sand, the emerald of the lagoon, and the turquoise of\r\nthe ocean made a picture of color and form never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nBut where are the Frenchmen? The next morning there is the _Eclaireur_\r\nlying a mile or so out, and there is a boat with the bo'sun--_maître\r\nd'équipage_--pulling towards the surf. I wade out to the brink. He\r\nhalloes:\r\n\r\n\"Where is the landing, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mais ici_\"--Right here,--I say.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that's all very well for _persons_, but where do you land _les\r\nbagages_?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Mais ici_\" I say again, and he says, \"_Diable!_\"\r\n\r\nBut all the same he lands both persons and baggage in a neat,\r\nsailor-like way. In a couple of days our two parties of fifty persons\r\nhad taken possession of this fairy isle. Observatories go up,\r\ntelescopes, spectroscopes, photographic cameras are pointed and\r\nadjusted. The eventful day arrives. Everything is successful. Then\r\ncomes the Hartford and takes us away, and a few days later comes the\r\n_Eclaireur_, and the Frenchmen are gone. The little island is left\r\nthere, abandoned to the five natives who tend the sickly plantation of\r\ncocoa-palms, and live from year to year with no incident but the\r\nannual visit of \"the blig\" (Kanaka for brig), which brings their store\r\nof ship biscuit and molasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"OBSERVATORIES GO UP.\"]\r\n\r\nThink of their stupendous experience! For years and years they have\r\nlived like that in the marvellous, continuous charm of the silent\r\nisland. The \"blig\" had come and gone away this year, and there will\r\nbe no more disturbance and discord for a twelve-month longer.\r\n\r\n  \"Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore\r\n  Than labor in the deep mid-ocean, wind, and wave, and oar,\r\n  Then rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more!\"\r\n\r\nNot so! for here comes a great warship out of the East under a press\r\nof canvas. What event is this? See! she clews up her light sails and\r\nfires an eleven-inch gun! One of those guns of Mobile Bay. Then swarms\r\nout the starboard watch, one hundred and sixty strong, and a fleet of\r\nboats brings ashore these pale astronomers with those useless tubes\r\nthat they point at the sky every night. But there are useful things\r\ntoo; cooking-stoves, and lumber, and bricks.\r\n\r\nWhat is all this? No sooner are these established than comes another\r\nship and fires its gun! and another set of hardy sailormen pours out,\r\nand here is another party of madmen with tubes,--yes, and with\r\ncooking-stoves and lumber, too. Then comes the crowning, stupendous,\r\nand unspeakable event. The whole sun is hidden and the heavens are\r\nlighted up with pearly streamers! In the name of all the Polynesian\r\ngods, what is the meaning of all this?\r\n\r\nAnd then in a few days all these are gone. All the madmen. They have\r\ntaken away the useless tubes, but they have left their houses\r\nstanding. Their splendid, priceless, precious cook-stoves are here.\r\nSee! here is a frying-pan! here are empty tin cans! and a keg of\r\nnails! They must have forgotten all this, madmen as they are!\r\n\r\nAnd the little island sinks back to its quiet and its calm. The lagoon\r\nlies placid like a mirror. The slow sea breaks eternally on the outer\r\nreef. The white clouds sail over day by day. The seabirds come back to\r\ntheir haunts,--the fierce man-of-war birds, the gentle, soft-eyed\r\ntern. But we, whose island home was thus invaded--are we the same? Was\r\nthis a dream? Will it happen again next year? every year? What indeed\r\nwas it that happened,--or in fact, did it happen at all? Is it not a\r\ndream, indeed?\r\n\r\nIf we left those peaceful Kanakas to their dream, we Americans have\r\nbrought ours away with us. Who will forget it? Which of us does not\r\nwish to be in that peaceful fairyland once more? That is the personal\r\nlonging. But we have all come back, each one with his note-books full;\r\nand in a few weeks the stimulus of accustomed habit has taken\r\npossession of us again. Right and wrong are again determined by\r\n\"municipal sanctions.\" We have become useful citizens once more.\r\nPerhaps it is just as well. We should have been poor poets, and we do\r\nnot forget. So ends the astronomer's voyage to fairyland.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHALOS--PARHELIA--THE SPECTRE OF THE BROCKEN, ETC\r\n\r\n(FROM THE ATMOSPHERE.)\r\n\r\nBY CAMILLE FLAMMARION.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTreatises on meteorology have not, up to the present day, classified\r\nwith sufficient regularity the divers optical phenomena of the air.\r\nSome of these phenomena have, however, been seen but rarely, and have\r\nnot been sufficiently studied to admit of their classification. We\r\nhave examined the common phenomenon of the rainbow and we have seen\r\nthat it is due to the refraction and reflection of light on drops of\r\nwater, and that it is seen upon the opposite side of the sky to the\r\nsun in day-time, or the moon at night. We are now about to consider an\r\norder of phenomena which are of rarer occurrence, but which have this\r\nproperty in common with the rainbow, viz., that they take place also\r\nupon the side of the sky opposite to the sun. These different optical\r\neffects are classed together under the name of _anthelia_ (from\r\nGreek, opposite to, and Greek, the sun). The optical phenomena which\r\noccur on the same side as, or around the sun, such as halos, parhelia,\r\netc., will be dealt with later on.\r\n\r\nBefore coming to the anthelia, properly so called, or to the colored\r\nrings which appear around a shadow, it is as well first to note the\r\neffects produced on the clouds and mists that are facing the sun when\r\nit rises or sets.\r\n\r\nUpon high mountains, the shadow of the mountain is often seen thrown\r\neither upon the surface of the lower mists or upon the neighboring\r\nmountains, and projected opposite to the sun almost horizontally. I\r\nonce saw the shadow of the Righi very distinctly traced upon Mount\r\nPilate, which is situated to the west of the Righi, on the other side\r\nof the Lake of Lucerne. This phenomenon occurs a few minutes after\r\nsunrise, and the triangular form of Righi is delineated in a shape\r\nvery easy to recognize.\r\n\r\nThe shadow of Mont Blanc is discerned more easily at sunset. MM.\r\nBravais and Martins, in one of their scientific ascents, noticed it\r\nunder specially favorable circumstances, the shadow being thrown upon\r\nthe snow-covered mountains, and gradually rising in the atmosphere\r\nuntil it reached a height of 1°, still remaining quite visible. The\r\nair above the cone of the shadow was tinted with that rosy purple\r\nwhich is seen, in a fine sunset, coloring the lofty peaks. \"Imagine,\"\r\nsays Bravais, \"the other mountains also projecting, at the same\r\nmoment, their shadows into the atmosphere, the lower parts dark and\r\nslightly greenish, and above each of these shadows the rosy surface,\r\nwith the deeper rose of the belt which separates it from them; add to\r\nthis the regular contour of the cones of the shadow, principally at\r\nthe upper edge, and lastly, the laws of perspective causing all these\r\nlines to converge the one to the other toward the very summit of the\r\nshadow of Mont Blanc; that is to say, to the point of the sky where\r\nthe shadows of our own selves were; and even then one will have but a\r\nfaint idea of the richness of the meteorological phenomenon displayed\r\nbefore our eyes for a few instants. It seemed as though an invisible\r\nbeing was seated upon a throne surrounded by fire, and that angels\r\nwith glittering wings were kneeling before him in adoration.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the natural phenomena which now attract our attention, but fail\r\nto excite our surprise, there are some which possess the\r\ncharacteristics of a supernatural intervention. The names which they\r\nhave received still bear witness to the terror which they once\r\ninspired; and even to-day, when science has stripped them of their\r\nmarvellous origin, and explained the causes of their production, these\r\nphenomena have retained a part of their primitive importance, and are\r\nwelcomed by the _savant_ with as much interest as when they were\r\nattributed to divine agency. Out of a large and very diverse number, I\r\nwill first select the _Spectre of the Brocken_.\r\n\r\nThe Brocken is the highest mountain in the picturesque Hartz chain,\r\nrunning through Hanover, being three hundred and thirty feet above the\r\nlevel of the sea.\r\n\r\nOne of the best descriptions of this phenomenon is given by the\r\ntraveller Hane, who witnessed it on the 23d of May, 1797. After having\r\nascended no less than thirty miles to the summit, he had the good\r\nfortune at last to contemplate the object of his curiosity. The sun\r\nrose at about four o'clock, the weather being fine, and the wind\r\ndriving off to the west the transparent vapors which had not yet had\r\ntime to be condensed into clouds. About a quarter-past four, Hane saw\r\nin this direction a human figure of enormous dimensions. A gust of\r\nwind nearly blowing off his hat at that moment, he raised his hand to\r\nsecure it, and the colossal figure imitated his action. Hane, noticing\r\nthis, at once made a stooping movement, and this was also reproduced\r\nby the spectre. He then called another person to him, and placing\r\nthemselves in the very spot where the apparition was first seen, the\r\npair kept their eyes fixed on the Achtermannshohe, but saw nothing.\r\nAfter a short interval, however, two colossal figures appeared, which\r\nrepeated the gestures made by them, and then disappeared.\r\n\r\nSome few years ago, in the summer of 1862, a French artist, M.\r\nStroobant, witnessed and carefully sketched this phenomenon, which is\r\ndrawn in full-page illustration, opposite p. 272. He had slept at the\r\ninn of the Brocken, and rising at two in the morning, he repaired to\r\nthe plateau upon the summit in the company of a guide. They reached\r\nthe highest point just as the first glimmer of the rising sun enabled\r\nthem to distinguish clearly objects at a great distance. To use M.\r\nStroobant's own words, \"My guide, who had for some time appeared to be\r\nwalking in search of something, suddenly led me to an elevation whence\r\nI had the singular privilege of contemplating for a few instants the\r\nmagnificent effect of mirage, which is termed the Spectre of the\r\nBrocken. The appearance is most striking. A thick mist, which seemed\r\nto emerge from the clouds like an immense curtain, suddenly rose to\r\nthe west of the mountain, a rainbow was formed, then certain\r\nindistinct shapes were delineated. First, the large tower of the inn\r\nwas reproduced upon a gigantic scale; after that we saw our two selves\r\nin a more vague and less exact shape, and these shadows were in each\r\ninstance surrounded by the colors of the rainbow, which served as a\r\nframe to this fairy picture. Some tourists who were staying at the inn\r\nhad seen the sun rise from their windows, but no one had witnessed the\r\nmagnificent spectacle which had taken place on the other side of the\r\nmountain.\"\r\n\r\nSometimes these spectres are surrounded by colored concentric arcs.\r\nSince the beginning of the present century, treatises on meteorology\r\ndesignate, under the name of the _Ulloa circle_, the pale external\r\narch which surrounds the phenomenon, and this same circle has\r\nsometimes been called the \"white rainbow.\" But it is not formed at the\r\nsame angular distance as the rainbow, and, although pale, it often\r\nenvelops a series of interior colored arcs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"THE SPECTRE OF THE BROCKEN\"]\r\n\r\nUlloa, being in company with six fellow-travellers upon the Pambamarca\r\nat daybreak one morning, observed that the summit of the mountain was\r\nentirely covered with thick clouds, and that the sun, when it rose,\r\ndissipated them, leaving only in their stead light vapors, which it\r\nwas almost impossible to distinguish. Suddenly, in the opposite\r\ndirection to where the sun was rising, \"each of the travellers beheld,\r\nat about seventy feet from where he was standing, his own image\r\nreflected in the air as in a mirror. The image was in the centre of\r\nthree rainbows of different colors, and surrounded at a certain\r\ndistance by a fourth bow with only one color. The inside color of each\r\nbow was carnation or red, the next shade was violet, the third yellow,\r\nthe fourth straw color, the last green. All these bows were\r\nperpendicular to the horizon; they moved in the direction of, and\r\nfollowed, the image of the person they enveloped as with a glory.\" The\r\nmost remarkable point was that, although the seven spectators were\r\nstanding in a group, each person only saw the phenomenon in regard to\r\nhis own person, and was disposed to disbelieve that it was repeated in\r\nrespect to his companions. The extent of the bows increased\r\ncontinually and in proportion to the height of the sun; at the same\r\ntime their colors faded away, the spectre became paler and more\r\nindistinct, and finally the phenomenon disappeared altogether. At the\r\nfirst appearance the shape of the bows was oval, but toward the end\r\nthey became quite circular. The same apparition was observed in the\r\npolar regions by Scoresby, and described by him. He states that the\r\nphenomenon appears whenever there is mist and at the same time shining\r\nsun. In the polar seas, whenever a rather thick mist rises over the\r\nocean, an observer, placed on the mast, sees one or several circles\r\nupon the mist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ULLOA CIRCLE.]\r\n\r\nThese circles are concentric, and their common centre is in the\r\nstraight line joining the eye of the observer to the sun, and extended\r\nfrom the sun toward the mist. The number of circles varies from one to\r\nfive; they are particularly numerous and well colored when the sun is\r\nvery brilliant and the mist thick and low. On July 23, 1821, Scoresby\r\nsaw four concentric circles around his head. The colors of the first\r\nand of the second were very well defined; those of the third, only\r\nvisible at intervals, were very faint, and the fourth only showed a\r\nslight greenish tint.\r\n\r\nThe meteorologist Kaemtz has often observed the same fact in the Alps.\r\nWhenever this shadow was projected upon a cloud, his head appeared\r\nsurrounded by a luminous aureola.\r\n\r\nTo what action of light is this phenomenon due? Bouguer is of opinion\r\nthat it must be attributed to the passage of light through icy\r\nparticles. Such, also, is the opinion of De Saussure, Scoresby, and\r\nother meteorologists.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the mountains, as we cannot assure ourselves directly of\r\nthe fact by entering the clouds, we are reduced to conjecture. The\r\naerostat traversing the clouds completely, and passing by the very\r\npoint where the apparition is seen, affords one an opportunity of\r\nascertaining the state of the cloud. This observation I have been able\r\nto make, and so to offer an explanation of the phenomenon.\r\n\r\nAs the balloon sails on, borne forward by the wind, its shadow travels\r\neither on the ground or on the clouds. This shadow is, as a rule,\r\nblack, like all others; but it frequently happens that it appears\r\nalone on the surface of the ground, and thus appears luminous.\r\nExamining this shadow by the aid of a telescope, I have noticed that\r\nit is often composed of a dark nucleus and a penumbra of the shape of\r\nan aureola. This aureola, frequently very large in proportion to the\r\ndiameter of the central nucleus, eclipses it to the naked eye, so that\r\nthe whole shadow appears like a nebulous circle projected in yellow\r\nupon the green ground of the woods and meadows. I have noticed, too,\r\nthat this luminous shadow is generally all the more strongly marked in\r\nproportion to the greater humidity of the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nSeen upon the clouds, this shadow sometimes presents a curious aspect.\r\nI have often, when the balloon emerged from the clouds into the clear\r\nsky, suddenly perceived, at twenty or thirty yards' distance, a second\r\nballoon distinctly delineated, and apparently of a grayish color,\r\nagainst the white ground of the clouds. This phenomenon manifests\r\nitself at the moment when the sun re-appears. The smallest details of\r\nthe car can be made out clearly, and our gestures are strikingly\r\nreproduced by the shadow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SHADOW OF THE BALLOON WAS SEEN BY US.]\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 1868, at about half-past three in the afternoon, we\r\nemerged from a stratum of clouds, when the shadow of the balloon was\r\nseen by us, surrounded by colored concentric circles, of which the car\r\nformed the centre. It was very plainly visible upon a yellowish white\r\nground. A first circle of pale blue encompassed this ground and the\r\ncar in a kind of ring. Around this ring was a second of a deeper\r\nyellow, then a grayish red zone, and lastly as the exterior\r\ncircumference, a fourth circle, violet in hue, and imperceptibly\r\ntoning down into the gray tint of the clouds. The slightest details\r\nwere clearly discernible--net, robes, and instruments. Every one of\r\nour gestures was instantaneously reproduced by the aerial spectres.\r\nThe anthelion remained upon the clouds sufficiently distinct, and for\r\na sufficiently long time, to permit of my taking a sketch in my\r\njournal and studying the physical condition of the clouds upon which\r\nit was produced. I was able to determine directly the circumstances of\r\nits production. Indeed, as this brilliant phenomenon occurred in the\r\nmidst of the very clouds which I was traversing, it was easy for me to\r\nascertain that these clouds were not formed of frozen particles. The\r\nthermometer marked 2° above zero. The hygrometer marked a maximum of\r\nhumidity experienced, namely, seventy-seven at three thousand seven\r\nhundred and seventy feet, and the balloon was then at four thousand\r\nsix hundred feet, where the humidity was only seventy-three. It is\r\ntherefore certain that this is a phenomenon of the diffraction of\r\nlight simply produced by the vesicles of the mist.\r\n\r\nThe name of diffraction is given to all the modifications which the\r\nluminous rays undergo when they come in contact with the surface of\r\nbodies. Light, under these circumstances, is subject to a sort of\r\ndeviation, at the same time becoming decomposed, whence result those\r\ncurious appearances in the shadows of objects which were observed for\r\nthe first time by Grimaldi and Newton.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting phenomena of diffraction are those presented by\r\n_gratings_, as are technically denominated the systems of linear and\r\nvery narrow openings situated parallel to one another and at very\r\nsmall intervals. A system of this kind may be realized by tracing with\r\na diamond, for instance, on a pane of glass equidistant lines very\r\nclose together. As the light would be able to pass in the interstices\r\nbetween the strokes, whereas it would be stopped in the points\r\ncorresponding to those where the glass was not smooth, there is, in\r\nreality, an effect produced as if there were a series of openings very\r\nnear to each other. A hundred strokes, about 1/25th of an inch in\r\nlength, may thus be drawn without difficulty. The light is then\r\ndecomposed in spectra, each overlapping the other. It is a phenomenon\r\nof this kind which is seen when we look into the light with the eye\r\nhalf closed; the eyelashes in this case, acting as a net-work or\r\ngrating. These net-works may also be produced by reflection, and it is\r\nto this circumstance that are due the brilliant colors observed when a\r\npencil of luminous rays is reflected on a metallic surface regularly\r\nstriated.\r\n\r\nTo the phenomena of gratings must be attributed, too, the colors,\r\noften so brilliant, to be seen in mother-of-pearl. This substance is\r\nof a laminated structure; so much so, that in carving it the different\r\nfolds are often cut in such a way as to form a regular net-work upon\r\nthe surface. It is, again, to a phenomenon of this sort that are due\r\nthe rainbow hues seen in the feathers of certain birds, and sometimes\r\nin spiders' webs. The latter, although very fine, are not simple, for\r\nthey are composed of a large number of pieces joined together by a\r\nviscous substance, and thus constitute a kind of net-work.\r\n\r\nIf the sun is near the horizon, and the shadow of the observer falls\r\nupon the grass, upon a field of corn, or other surface covered with\r\ndew, there is visible an aureola, the light of which is especially\r\nbright about the head, but which diminishes from below the middle of\r\nthe body. This light is due to the reflection of light by the moist\r\nstubble and the drops of dew. It is brighter about the head, because\r\nthe blades that are near where the shadow of the head falls expose to\r\nit all that part of them which is lighted up, whereas those farther\r\noff expose not only the part which is lighted up, but other parts\r\nwhich are not, and this diminishes the brightness in proportion as\r\ntheir distance from the head increases. The phenomenon is seen\r\nwhenever there is simultaneously mist and sun. This fact is easily\r\nverified upon a mountain. As soon as the shadow of a mountaineer is\r\nprojected upon a mist, his head gives rise to a shadow surrounded by a\r\nluminous aureola.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOG-BOW SEEN FROM THE MATTERHORN.]\r\n\r\n_The Illustrated London News_ of July 8, 1871, illustrates one of\r\nthese apparitions, \"The Fog-Bow, seen from the Matterhorn,\" observed\r\nby E. Whymper in this celebrated region of the Alps. The observation\r\nwas taken just after the catastrophe of July 14, 1865; and by a\r\ncurious coincidence, two immense white aerial crosses projected into\r\nthe interior of the external arc. These two crosses were no doubt\r\nformed by the intersection of circles, the remaining parts of which\r\nwere invisible. The apparition was of a grand and solemn character,\r\nfurther increased by the silence of the fathomless abyss into which\r\nthe four ill-fated tourists had just been precipitated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOther optical appearances of an analogous kind are manifested under\r\ndifferent conditions. Thus, for instance, if any one, turning his back\r\nto the sun, looks into water, he will perceive the shadow of his head,\r\nbut always very much deformed. At the same time he will see starting\r\nfrom this very shadow what seem to be luminous bodies, which dart\r\ntheir rays in all directions with inconceivable rapidity, and to a\r\ngreat distance. These luminous appearances--these aureola rays--have,\r\nin addition to the darting movement, a rapid rotary movement around\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANET VENUS\r\n\r\nBY AGNES M. CLERKE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nHESPERUS AND PHOSPHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe radiant planet that hangs on the skirts of dusk and dawn\r\n\r\n     \"like a jewel in an Ethiop's ear,\"\r\n\r\nhas been known and sung by poets in all ages. Its supremacy over the\r\nremainder of the starry host is recognized in the name given it by the\r\nArabs, those nomad watchers of the skies, for while they term the moon\r\n\"El Azhar,\" \"the Brighter One,\" and the sun and moon together \"El\r\nAzharan,\" \"the Brighter Pair,\" they call Venus \"Ez Zahra,\" the bright\r\nor shining one _par excellence_, in which sense the same word is used\r\nto describe a flower. This \"Flower of Night\" is supposed to be no\r\nother than the white rose into which Adonis was changed by Venus in\r\nthe fable which is the basis of all early Asiatic mythology. The\r\nmorning and evening star is thus the celestial symbol of that union\r\nbetween earth and heaven in the vivifying processes of nature,\r\ntypified in the love of the goddess for a mortal.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Greeks, on the other hand, not unnaturally took the star,\r\nwhich they saw alternately emerging from the effulgence of the rising\r\nand setting sun, in the east and in the west, for two distinct bodies,\r\nand named it differently according to the time of its appearance. The\r\nevening star they called Hesperus, and from its place on the western\r\nhorizon, fabled an earthly hero of that name, the son of Atlas, who\r\nfrom the slopes of that mountain on the verge of the known world used\r\nto observe the stars until eventually carried off by a mighty wind,\r\nand so translated to the skies. These divine honors were earned by his\r\npiety, wisdom, and justice as a ruler of men, and his name long shed a\r\nshimmering glory over those Hesperidean regions of the earth, where\r\nthe real and unreal touched hands in the mystical twilight of the\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nBut the morning star shone with a different significance as the herald\r\nof the day, the torchbearer who lights the way for radiant Aurora on\r\nher triumphal progress through the skies. Hence he was called\r\nEosphorus, or Phosphorus, the bearer of the dawn, translated into\r\nLatin as Lucifer, the Light-bearer. The son of Eos, or Aurora, and the\r\nTitan Astraeus, he was of the same parentage as the other multitude of\r\nthe starry host, to whom a similar origin was ascribed, and from whom\r\nin Greek mythology he was evidently believed to differ only in the\r\nsuperior order of his brightness. Homer, who mentions the planet in\r\nthe following passage:\r\n\r\n  \"But when the star of Lucifer appeared,\r\n  The harbinger of light, whom following close,\r\n  Spreads o'er the sea the saffron-robed morn.\"\r\n\r\n                              (LORD DERBY'S \"Iliad.\")\r\n\r\nrecognizes no distinction between those celestial nomads, the planets,\r\n\"wandering stars,\" as the Arabs call them, which visibly change their\r\nposition relatively to the other stars, and the latter, whose places\r\non the sphere are apparently fixed and immutable. In this he and his\r\ncompatriots were far behind the ancient Egyptians, who probably\r\nderived their knowledge from still earlier speculators in Asia, for\r\nthey not only observed the movements of some at least of the planets,\r\nbut believed that Mercury and Venus revolved as satellites round the\r\nsun, which in its turn circled round our lesser world. Pythagoras is\r\nsaid to have been the first to identify Hesperus with Phosphor, as the\r\n\r\n  \"Silver planet both of eve and morn,\"\r\n\r\nand by Plato the same fact is recognized. The other planets, all of\r\nwhich had, according to him, been originally named in Egypt and Syria,\r\nhave each its descriptive title in his nomenclature. Thus the\r\ninnermost, \"the Star of Mercury,\" is called Stilbon, \"the Sparkler,\"\r\nMars, Pyroeis, \"the Fiery One,\" while Jupiter, the planet of the\r\nslowest course but one, is designated as Phaeton, and Saturn, the\r\ntardiest of all, Phaenon. These names were in later times abandoned in\r\nfavor of those of the divinities to whom they were respectively\r\ndedicated, unalterably associated now with the days of the week, over\r\nwhich they have been selected to preside.\r\n\r\nThe Copernican theory, which once and forever \"brushed the cobwebs out\r\nof the sky,\" by clearing away the mists of pre-existing error, first\r\ncompletely explained the varying positions of the Shepherd's star,\r\nirradiating the first or last watch of night, according to her\r\nalternate function as the follower or precursor of the sun. As she\r\ntravels on a path nearer to him by more than twenty-five and a half\r\nmillion miles than that of the earth, she is seen by us on each side\r\nof him in turn after passing behind or in front of him. The points at\r\nwhich her orbit expands most widely to our eyes--an effect of course\r\nentirely due to perspective, as her distance from the sun is not then\r\nactually increased--are called her eastern and western elongations;\r\nthat at which she passes by the sun on the hither side her inferior,\r\nand on the farther side her superior conjunction. At both conjunctions\r\nshe is lost to our view, since she accompanies the sun so closely as\r\nto be lost in his beams, rising and setting at the same time, and\r\ntravelling with him in his path through the heavens during the day.\r\nWhen at inferior conjunction, or between us and the sun, she turns her\r\ndark hemisphere to us like the new moon, and would consequently be\r\ninvisible in any case, but when in the opposite position, shows us her\r\nilluminated face, and is literally a day star, invisible only because\r\neffaced by the solar splendor. It is as she gradually separates from\r\nhim, after leaving this latter position, circling over that half of\r\nher orbit which lies to the east of him, that she begins to come into\r\nview as an evening star, following him at a greater and greater\r\ndistance, and consequently setting later, until she attains her\r\ngreatest eastern elongation, divided from the sun about 45° of his\r\nvisible circuit through the heavens, and consequently remaining above\r\nthe horizon for some four hours after him. From this point she again\r\nappears to draw nearer to him until she passes on his hither side in\r\ninferior conjunction, from which she emerges on the opposite side to\r\nthe westward, and begins to shine as a morning star, preceding him on\r\nhis track, at a gradually increasing distance, until attaining her\r\ngreatest westward elongation, and finally completing her cycle by\r\nreturning to superior conjunction once more in a period of about five\r\nhundred and eighty-four days.\r\n\r\nVenus is thus Hesperus or Vesper, the evening star, when following the\r\nsun as she passes from beyond him in superior conjunction to inferior\r\nconjunction where she is nearest to the earth. As she again leaves him\r\nbehind in her course from this point to the opposite one of superior\r\nconjunction, she appears in her second aspect as Phosphorus or\r\nLucifer, \"the sun of morning,\" and herald of the day, shining as\r\n\r\n                          \"The fair star\r\n  That gems the glittering coronet of morn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nTHE PHASES OF VENUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the changes in the aspect of Venus due to her varying positions in\r\nher orbit are not confined to those which cause her to oscillate with\r\na pendulum movement eastward and westward from the sun. The discovery\r\nthat she undergoes phases exactly like those of the moon, followed\r\nthat of the existence of Jupiter's satellites as the second great\r\nresult achieved by the use of the telescope in the hands of Galileo.\r\nThe fact that the planets were intrinsically dark bodies revolving\r\nround the sun, and reflecting its light, as he and Copernicus had\r\nmaintained, thus received a further ocular demonstration. The\r\nFlorentine astronomer describes in a letter to a friend how the\r\nplanet, after emerging from superior conjunction as a morning star,\r\ngradually loses her rotundity on the side remote from the luminary,\r\nchanging first to a half sphere and then to a waning crescent; until,\r\nafter passing through the stage of absolute extinction when\r\nintervening between us and the sun, she re-appears as a morning star,\r\nand undergoes the same series of transformations in inverse order. The\r\nrevelation was indeed so novel and unexpected, that when the slight\r\ndeformation of the planet's shape was first detected by him, he did\r\nnot venture to announce it in plain terms but veiled it, according to\r\nthe prevailing fashion of the time, under a Latin anagram. His\r\ncelebrated sentence--\r\n\r\n  \"Haec immatura a me jam frustra leguntur.\"\r\n\r\n(\"Those incomplete observations are as yet read by me in vain.\")\r\n\r\nforms, by transposing the letters, the more definite statement,\r\n\r\n  \"Cynthiæ figuras æmulatur Mater Amorum.\"\r\n\r\n(\"The mother of the loves imitates the aspects of Diana.\")\r\n\r\nthat is to say, Venus vies with the phases of the moon. The discovery\r\nwas an important one from its bearing on popular superstition ascribing\r\nto the planets special influences on human affairs, for since they were\r\nthus shown to transmit to us only borrowed light, belief in their\r\nbeneficent or malefic powers over man's destinies received a rude shock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PHASES OP VENUS.]\r\n\r\nGalileo's announcement, published in September, 1610, when only a\r\nslight flattening of the planet's disk was visible, received absolute\r\nconfirmation in the ensuing months, as she completed her full\r\nhalf-circle of change on February 24th of the following year, and\r\nconsequently exhibited herself to him in all her varying aspects. It\r\nwas the first time they had been looked upon by a human eye, since its\r\nunaided powers do not enable it to discern them, although one\r\nexception to this rule is said to have existed. This was the case of\r\nthe Swiss mathematician Gauss, who, when a child, on being shown the\r\ncrescent star through the telescope, exclaimed to his mother that it\r\n\"was turned wrong\"; the inference being that he recognized the\r\nreversal of the image in the field of the glass. If it were indeed so,\r\nhe deserves to rank with the Siberian savage, who described the\r\neclipses, or Jupiter's satellites; or the shoemaker of Breslau, who\r\ncould see and declare the positions of those minute orbs.\r\n\r\nThe phases exhibited to us by Venus are due to her moving in an orbit\r\nwithin that of the earth, at one side of which she is between us and\r\nthe sun, while at the other this position is exactly reversed. We may\r\ncompare her to a performer in a great celestial circus, lit by a\r\ncentral chandelier, and ourselves to spectators in an external ring,\r\nfrom which we see her at one time facing us with the light full on\r\nher, at the opposite point in complete shadow, and at the intermediate\r\nones in varying degrees of illumination according to our changing\r\nviews of her. The same illustration may serve to show why Venus is\r\nbrightest, not when full, since she is then beyond the sun, and at the\r\nfarthest possible point from us, but when she approaches us at\r\ninferior conjunction, more nearly by over one hundred and thirty\r\nmillion miles, and still shows us a crescent of her illuminated\r\nsurface, before passing into the last phase of total obscuration. When\r\nactually nearest to us she is absolutely invisible, being then, like\r\nthe new moon, between us and the sun. Her varying degrees of\r\nbrilliancy, even when in the same phase, are thus accounted for by her\r\nalternate retreat from and advance towards us as she circles round the\r\nsun. Completing, as she does, her revolution in about seven months and\r\na half, she would of course go through the whole series of her\r\nmetamorphoses in that time, were the earth, from which we observe\r\nthem, a fixed point. Their protraction instead, over a term of five\r\nhundred and eighty-four days, or more than nineteen months, is due to\r\nthe simultaneous motion of the earth in the same direction, over her\r\nlarger orbit in a longer period, causing the same relative position of\r\nthe sister planet to recur only as often as she overtakes her in her\r\ncareer. Thus the hour and minute hands of a watch, moving at different\r\nrates of speed after meeting on the dial plate at twelve o'clock, will\r\nnot again come together until five minutes past one, when the swifter\r\npaced of the two will have completed a revolution and a twelfth. But\r\nwere we to retard the motion of the latter, reducing it to only twice\r\nthat of its companion, they would always meet at the figure twelve, as\r\nit would exactly complete two circuits while the hour hand was\r\nperforming one. Venus thus overtakes and passes the earth once in five\r\nhundred and eighty-four days, or nearly two and a half of her own\r\nyears, constituting what is called her synodic period of apparent\r\nrevolution as seen from this globe. She thus presents to us all the\r\nphases undergone by our own satellite during a lunar month, passing\r\nfrom new to full, and _vice versa_, through the various intervening\r\ngradations of form.\r\n\r\nThe phases of Venus are amongst the most beautiful subjects for\r\nobservation in a moderate telescope, as her silver bow, gradually\r\nbrightening in the evening dusk, or fading in the dawn,\r\n\r\n  \"On a bed of daffodil sky,\"\r\n\r\nis, after the two greater luminaries that rule the day and night, the\r\nmost brilliant object in the heavens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nTHE SILVER CROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parallel between Venus and\r\n\r\n  \"That orbed maiden with fire laden,\r\n   Whom mortals call the moon,\"\r\n\r\nis carried a stage further. Most of us are familiar with the spectacle\r\nin which the Ancient Egyptians saw symbolized Horus on the lap of\r\nIsis, but which we more prosaically term \"the old moon in the new\r\nmoon's arms.\" The strongly illuminated half circle next the sun is\r\nthen seen embracing with its horns a dusky sphere, contrasting with it\r\nas tarnished silver does with the newly burnished metal. The same\r\nphenomenon is occasionally, though very rarely, exhibited by Venus,\r\nwhile close to the sun at inferior injunction, when the shadowy form\r\nof the full orb is seen to shine dimly within her crescent with what\r\nis termed \"the ashen light.\" More wonderful still, this \"glimmering\r\nsphere\" is then crowned, as with a silver halo, by a thin luminous\r\narch, forming a secondary sickle facing the one nearest the sun, and\r\ndoubtless due to the refraction of his rays round the globe of the\r\nplanet, through the upper regions of her twilight atmosphere. This\r\nspectacle was first observed by the Jesuit Ricciolo, an opponent of\r\nthe Copernican theory, on January 9th, 1643. He describes the planet\r\nas ruddy near the sun, yellowish in the middle, and of greenish blue\r\non the side remote from the sun; while he also noted the bow of light\r\nlimiting the dark hemisphere. Scarcely daring to trust his own\r\neyesight, he ascribed these appearances, although he recorded them, to\r\nillusory reflection in the telescope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VENUS AT HER GREATEST BRILLIANCY.]\r\n\r\nThey were again seen, however, by Derham about 1715, and six years\r\nlater by Kirch, in Berlin, who has the following entry in his diary\r\nfor Saturday, June 29, 1721:--\"I found Venus in a region where the sky\r\nwas not very clear. The planet was narrow, and I seemed to see its\r\ndark side, though this is almost incredible. The diameter of Venus was\r\n65\", and its sickle seemed to tremble in the atmospheric vapors.\"\r\nAgain, on March 8th, 1726, he records a similar observation. \"We\r\nobserved Venus with the twenty-six foot telescope. I perceived her\r\ndark side, and its edge seemed to describe a smaller circle than that\r\nof the light side, as is the case of the moon.\" This effect is due to\r\nirradiation, that is to say, to the glare from a bright surface,\r\ngiving a deceptive enlargement to its apparent area. He again saw the\r\ndark side of the planet in October, 1759, as did Harding at Göttingen,\r\nwith Herschel's ten-foot reflector, on January 24th, 1806. This latter\r\nobserver saw it on this occasion stand out against the background of\r\nthe sky as of a pale ashen green, while on February 28th following, it\r\nseemed to him of a pale reddish gray, like the color of the eclipsed\r\nmoon.\r\n\r\nThat the latter body should send to us from her nocturnal shadows\r\nsufficient light to be visible is easily explicable, since she is then\r\nflooded with earth-light reflected on her from a surface thirteen and\r\none-half times greater than her own, and probably casting on her an\r\nillumination transcending our full moonlight in the same proportion.\r\nBut the secondary light of Venus admits of no such explanation, since\r\nearth-light on her surface, diminished by 1/12000th part compared to\r\nwhat it is on that of the moon, would be quite insufficient to render\r\nher visible to our eyes. The phenomenon was therefore adduced as an\r\nargument for the habitability of the planets by Gruithuisen, of the\r\nMunich Observatory, who, writing early in this century, suggested that\r\nthe ashen light of Venus might be due to general illuminations in\r\ncelebration by her inhabitants of some periodically recurring\r\nfestivity, The materials for a flare-up on so grand a scale would, he\r\nthought, exist in abundance, as he conjectured the vegetation of our\r\nplanetary neighbor to be more luxuriant than that of our Brazilian\r\nforests. The phosphorescence of the Aphroditean oceans, warm and\r\nteeming with life, as they are held to be by Zollner, was advanced as\r\nan explanatory hypothesis, with scarcely more plausibility, by\r\nProfessor Safarik, while others have resorted to the supposition of\r\natmospheric or electrical luminosity producing on a large scale some\r\nsuch display as that of the aurora borealis.\r\n\r\nProfessor Vogel, of Berlin, who himself saw part of the night-side of\r\nVenus, in its semi-obscurity in November, 1871, ascribed its\r\nvisibility to a twilight effect caused by a very extensive atmosphere.\r\nThe light thus transmitted to us by aerial diffusion and giving the\r\nashen light, is reflected sunlight, while that sent by the luminous\r\narc on its edge is direct sunlight, refracted, or bent round to us,\r\nfrom behind the planet. The silver selvedge of the dawn edging the\r\ndark limb may consequently be the brightest part of the broken nimbus\r\nthat then seems to surround her.\r\n\r\nA similar appearance is observed during transits of Venus, when she\r\npasses directly between us and the actual solar disk. A silver thread\r\nis then seen encircling that side of the planet which has not yet\r\nentered on the face of the sun or \"a shadowy nebulous ring,\" as it was\r\ndescribed by Mr. Macdonnell at Eden, surrounds the whole planetary\r\ndisk when two-thirds of it have passed the solar edge. As it moves off\r\nit, the same aureole again becomes visible, testifying to the\r\nexistence of an atmosphere of considerable extent exterior to the\r\nsharply outlined surface ordinarily visible. The shimmering haze of\r\nreflected sunlight which perpetually enfolds her is only made apparent\r\nto us under exceptional circumstances which cut off some portion of\r\nher more immediate light, just as we see the motes in the air\r\nilluminated by a candle if we hide the actual flame from our eyes. The\r\nperennial twilight which seems to reign over the nocturnal hemisphere\r\nof Venus may compensate, perhaps, for the want of a satellite to\r\nmodify its darkness.\r\n\r\nThe great prolongation at other times of the horns of her crescent, so\r\nas to embrace almost her entire circumference with a tenuous ring of\r\nlight, is doubtless due to the same cause, as their visibility should\r\notherwise be limited to a half segment of a circle. The regions thus\r\nshining to us are obviously those on which the sun has not yet set,\r\nhis appearance above the horizon being prolonged, as in our own case,\r\nby refraction, though to a much larger extent. The magnitude of the\r\nsun's disk as seen from Venus, a third larger than it appears to us,\r\nis also adducted by Mr. Proctor in his posthumous work, \"The Old and\r\nthe New Astronomy,\" edited and completed by Mr. A.C. Ranyard, as an\r\nelement in extending the illumination of Venus to more than a\r\nhemisphere of her surface. As his diameter there is 44-1/4°, a zone\r\nof more than 22° wide outside the sunward hemisphere is he thinks\r\nilluminated by direct though partial sunlight, the orb being\r\nthroughout this tract still partially above the horizon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GEOGRAPHICAL ASPECT OF VENUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STARS\r\n\r\n(FROM STARLAND.)\r\n\r\nBY SIR ROBERT S. BALL.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe group of bodies which cluster around our sun forms a little\r\nisland, so to speak, in the extent of infinite space. We may\r\nillustrate this by a map in which we shall endeavor to show the stars\r\nplaced at their proper relative distances. We first open the compasses\r\none inch, and thus draw a little circle to represent the path of the\r\nearth. We are not going to put in all the planets. We take Neptune,\r\nthe outermost, at once. To draw its path I open the compasses to\r\nthirty inches, and draw a circle with that radius. That will do for\r\nour solar system, though the comets no doubt will roam beyond these\r\nlimits. To complete our map we ought of course to put in some stars.\r\nThere are a hundred million to choose from, and we shall begin with\r\nthe brightest. It is often called the Dog Star, but astronomers know\r\nit better as Sirius. Let us see where it is to be placed on our map.\r\nSirius is beyond Neptune, so it must be outside somewhere. Indeed, it\r\nis a good deal further off than Neptune; so I try at the edge of the\r\ndrawing-board; I have got a method of making a little calculation that\r\nI do not intend to trouble you with, but I can assure you that the\r\nresults it leads me to are quite correct; they show me that this board\r\nis not big enough. But could a board which was big enough fit into\r\nthis lecture theatre? Here, again, I make my little calculations, and\r\nI find that there would not be room for a board sufficiently great; in\r\nfact, if I put the sun here at one end, with its planets around it?\r\nSirius would be too near on the same scale if it were at the further\r\ncorner. The board would have to go out through the wall of the\r\ntheatre, out through London. Indeed, big as London is, it would not be\r\nlarge enough to contain the drawing-board that I should require. It\r\nwould have to stretch about twenty miles from where we are now\r\nassembled. We may therefore dismiss any hope of making a practical map\r\nof our system on this scale if Sirius is to have its proper place. Let\r\nus, then, take some other star. We shall naturally try with the\r\nnearest of all. It is one that we do not know in this part of the\r\nworld, but those that live in the southern hemisphere are well\r\nacquainted with it. The name of this star is Alpha Centauri. Even for\r\nthis star we should require a drawing three or four miles long if the\r\ndistance from the earth to the sun is to be taken as one inch. You see\r\nwhat an isolated position our sun and his planets occupy. The members\r\nof the family are all close together, and the nearest neighbors are\r\nsituated at enormous distances. There is a good reason for this\r\nseparation. The stars are very pretty and perfectly harmless to us\r\nwhere they are at present situated. They might be very troublesome\r\nneighbors if they were very much closer to our system. It is therefore\r\nwell they are so far off; they would be constantly making disturbances\r\nin the sun's family if they were near at hand. Sometimes they would be\r\ndragging us into unpleasantly great heat by bringing us too close to\r\nthe sun, or producing a coolness by pulling us away from the sun,\r\nwhich would be quite as disagreeable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stars are Suns.\r\n\r\nWe are about to discuss one of the grandest truths in the whole of\r\nnature. We have had occasion to see that this sun of ours is a\r\nmagnificent globe immensely larger than the greatest of his planets,\r\nwhile the greatest of these planets is immensely larger than this\r\nearth; but now we are to learn that our sun is, indeed, only a star\r\nnot nearly so bright as many of those which shine over our heads every\r\nnight. We are comparatively close to the sun, so that we are able to\r\nenjoy his beautiful light and cheering heat. Each of those other\r\nmyriads of stars is a sun, and the splendor of those distant suns is\r\noften far greater than that of our own. We are, however, so enormously\r\nfar from them that they appear dwindled down to insignificance. To\r\njudge impartially between our sun or star and such a sun or star as\r\nSirius we should stand halfway between the two; it is impossible to\r\nmake a fair estimate when we find ourselves situated close to one star\r\nand a million times as far from the other. After allowance is made for\r\nthe imperfections of our point of view, we are enabled to realize the\r\nmajestic truth that the sun is no more than a star, and that the other\r\nstars are no less than suns. This gives us an imposing idea of the\r\nextent and magnificence of the universe in which we are situated. Look\r\nlip at the sky at night--you will see a host of stars; try to think\r\nthat every one of them is itself a sun. It may probably be that those\r\nsuns have planets circling round them, but it is hopeless for us to\r\nexpect to see such planets. Were you standing on one of those stars\r\nand looking towards our system, you would not perceive the sun to be\r\nthe brilliant and gorgeous object that we know so well. If you could\r\nsee him at all, he would merely seem like a star, not nearly as bright\r\nas many of those you can see at night. Even if you had the biggest of\r\ntelescopes to aid your vision, you could never discern from one of\r\nthese bodies the planets which surround the sun, no astronomer in the\r\nstars could see Jupiter, even if his sight were a thousand times as\r\npowerful as any sight or telescope that we know. So minute an object\r\nas our earth would, of course, be still more hopelessly beyond the\r\npossibility of vision.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Number of the Stars.\r\n\r\nTo count the stars involves a task which lies beyond the power of man\r\nto accomplish. Even without the aid of any telescope, we can see a\r\ngreat multitude of stars from this part of the world. There are also\r\nmany constellations in the southern hemisphere which never appear\r\nabove our horizon. If, however, we were to go to the equator, then, by\r\nwaiting there for a twelve-month, all the stars in the heavens would\r\nhave been successively exposed to view. An astronomer, Houzeau, with\r\nthe patience to count them, enumerated about six thousand. This is the\r\nnaked-eye estimate of the star-population of the heavens; but if\r\ninstead of relying on unaided vision, you get the assistance of a\r\nlittle telescope, you will be astounded at the enormous multitude of\r\nstars which are disclosed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 1. THE GREAT BEAR AND THE POLE.]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary opera-glass or binocular is a very useful instrument for\r\nlooking at the stars in the heavens. If you employ an instrument of\r\nthis sort, you will be amazed to find that the heavens teem with\r\nadditional hosts of stars that your unaided vision would never have\r\ngiven you knowledge of. Any part of the sky may be observed; but, just\r\nto give an illustration, I shall take one special region, namely, that\r\nof the Great Bear (Fig. 1). The seven well-known stars are here shown,\r\nfour of which form a sort of oblong, while the other three represent\r\nthe tail. I would like you to make this little experiment. On a fine\r\nclear night, count how many stars there are within this oblong; they\r\nare all very faint, but you will be able to see a few, and, with good\r\nsight, and on a clear night, you may see perhaps ten. Next take your\r\nopera-glass and sweep it over the same region; if you will carefully\r\ncount the stars it shows, you will find fully two hundred; so that\r\nthe opera-glass has, in this part of the sky, revealed nearly twenty\r\ntimes as many stars as could be seen without its aid. As six thousand\r\nstars can be seen by the eye all over the heavens, we may fairly\r\nexpect that twenty times that number--that is to say, one hundred and\r\ntwenty thousand stars--could be shown by the opera-glass over the\r\nentire sky. Let us go a step further, and employ a telescope, the\r\nobject-glass of which is three inches across. This is a useful\r\ntelescope to have, and, if a good one, will show multitudes of\r\npleasing objects, though an astronomer would not consider it very\r\npowerful. An instrument like this, small enough to be carried in the\r\nhand, has been applied to the task of enumerating the stars in the\r\nnorthern half of the sky, and three hundred and twenty thousand stars\r\nwere counted. Indeed, the actual number that might have been seen with\r\nit is considerably greater, for when the astronomer Argelander made\r\nthis memorable investigation he was unable to reckon many of the stars\r\nin localities where they lay very close together. This grand count\r\nonly extended to half the sky, and, assuming that the other half is as\r\nrichly inlaid with stars, we see that a little telescope like that we\r\nhave supposed will, when swept over the heavens, reveal a number of\r\nstars which exceeds that of the population of any city in England\r\nexcept London. It exhibits more than one hundred times as many stars\r\nas our eyes could possibly reveal. Still, we are only at the beginning\r\nof the count; the very great telescopes add largely to the number.\r\nThere are multitudes of stars which in small instruments we cannot\r\nsee, but which are distinctly visible from our great observatories.\r\nThat telescope would be still but a comparatively small one which\r\nwould show as many stars in the sky as there are people living in the\r\nmighty city of London; and with the greatest instruments, the tale of\r\nstars has risen to a number far greater than that of the entire\r\npopulation of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those stars which the largest telescopes show us, there\r\nare myriads which make their presence evident in a wholly different\r\nway. It is only in quite recent times that an attempt has been made to\r\ndevelop fully the powers of photography in representing the celestial\r\nobjects. On a photographic plate which has been exposed to the sky in\r\na great telescope the stars are recorded by thousands. Many of these\r\nmay, of course, be observed with a good telescope, but there are not a\r\nfew others which no one ever saw in a telescope, which apparently no\r\none ever could see, though the photograph is able to show them. We do\r\nnot, however, employ a camera like that which the photographer uses\r\nwho is going to take your portrait. The astronomer's plate is put into\r\nhis telescope, and then the telescope is turned towards the sky. On\r\nthat plate the stars produce their images, each by its own light. Some\r\nof these images are excessively faint, but we give a very long\r\nexposure of an hour or two hours; sometimes as much as four hours'\r\nexposure is given to a plate so sensitive that a mere fraction of a\r\nsecond would sufficiently expose it during the ordinary practice of\r\ntaking a photograph in daylight. We thus afford sufficient time to\r\nenable the fainter objects to indicate their presence upon the\r\nsensitive film. Even with an exposure of a single hour a picture\r\nexhibiting sixteen thousand stars has been taken by Mr. Isaac Roberts,\r\nof Liverpool. Yet the portion of the sky which it represents is only\r\none ten-thousandth part of the entire heavens. It should be added that\r\nthe region which Mr. Roberts has photographed is furnished with stars\r\nin rather exceptional profusion.\r\n\r\nHere, at last, we have obtained some conception of the sublime scale\r\non which the stellar universe is constructed. Yet even these plates\r\ncannot represent all the stars that the heavens contain. We have every\r\nreason for knowing that with larger telescopes, with more sensitive\r\nplates, with more prolonged exposures, ever fresh myriads of stars\r\nwill be brought within our view.\r\n\r\nYou must remember that every one of these stars is truly a sun, a\r\nlamp, as it were, which doubtless gives light to other objects in its\r\nneighborhood as our sun sheds light upon this earth and the other\r\nplanets. In fact, to realize the glories of the heavens you should try\r\nto think that the brilliant points you see are merely the luminous\r\npoints of the otherwise invisible universe.\r\n\r\nStanding one fine night on the deck of a Cunarder we passed in open\r\nocean another great Atlantic steamer. The vessel was near enough for\r\nus to see not only the light from the mast-head but also the little\r\nbeams from the several cabin ports; and we could see nothing of the\r\nship herself. Her very existence was only known to us by the twinkle\r\nof these lights. Doubtless her passengers could see, and did see, the\r\nsimilar lights from our own vessel, and they probably drew the correct\r\ninference that these lights indicated a great ship.\r\n\r\nConsider the multiplicity of beings and objects in a ship: the\r\ncaptain and the crew, the passengers, the cabins, the engines, the\r\nboats, the rigging, and the stores. Think of all the varied interests\r\nthere collected and then reflect that out on the ocean, at night, the\r\nsole indication of the existence of this elaborate structure was given\r\nby the few beams of light that happened to radiate from it. Now raise\r\nyour eyes to the stars; there are the twinkling lights. We cannot see\r\nwhat those lights illuminate, we can only conjecture what untold\r\nwealth of non-luminous bodies may also lie in their vicinity; we may,\r\nhowever, feel certain that just as the few gleaming lights from a ship\r\nare utterly inadequate to give a notion of the nature and the contents\r\nof an Atlantic steamer, so are the twinkling stars utterly inadequate\r\nto give even the faintest conception of the extent and the interest of\r\nthe universe. We merely see self-luminous bodies, but of the\r\nmultitudes of objects and the elaborate systems of which these bodies\r\nare only the conspicuous points we see nothing and we know very\r\nlittle. We are, however, entitled to infer from an examination of our\r\nown star--the sun--and of the beautiful system by which it is\r\nsurrounded, that these other suns may be also splendidly attended.\r\nThis is quite as reasonable a supposition as that a set of lights seen\r\nat night on the Atlantic Ocean indicates the existence of a fine ship.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clusters of Stars.\r\n\r\nOn a clear night you can often see, stretching across the sky, a track\r\nof faint light, which is known to astronomers as the \"Milky Way.\" It\r\nextends below the horizon, and then round the earth to form a girdle\r\nabout the heavens. When we examine the Milky Way with a telescope we\r\nfind, to our amazement, that it consists of myriads of stars, so small\r\nand so faint that we are not able to distinguish them individually; we\r\nmerely see the glow produced from their collective rays. Remembering\r\nthat our sun is a star, and that the Milky Way surrounds us, it would\r\nalmost seem as if our sun were but one of the host of stars which form\r\nthis cluster.\r\n\r\nThere are also other clusters of stars, some of which are exquisitely\r\nbeautiful telescopic spectacles. I may mention a celebrated pair of\r\nthese objects which lies in the constellation of Perseus. The sight of\r\nthem in a great telescope is so imposing that no one who is fit to\r\nlook through a telescope could resist a shout of wonder and admiration\r\nwhen first they burst on his view. But there are other clusters. Here\r\nis a picture of one which is known as the \"Globular Cluster in the\r\nCentaur\" (Fig. 2). It consists of a ball of stars, so far off that,\r\nhowever large these several suns may actually be, they have dwindled\r\ndown to extremely small points of light. A homely illustration may\r\nserve to show the appearance which a globular cluster presents in a\r\ngood telescope. I take a pepper-caster, and on a sheet of white paper\r\nI begin to shake out the pepper until there is a little heap at the\r\ncentre and other grains are scattered loosely about. Imagine that\r\nevery one of those grains of pepper was to be transformed into a tiny\r\nelectric light, and then you have some idea of what a cluster of stars\r\nwould look like when viewed through a telescope of sufficient power.\r\nThere are multitudes of such groups scattered through the depths of\r\nspace. They require our biggest telescopes to show them adequately. We\r\nhave seen that our sun is a star, being only one of a magnificent\r\ncluster that forms the Milky Way. We have also seen that there are\r\nother groups scattered through the length and depth of space. It is\r\nthus we obtain a notion of the rank which our earth holds in the\r\nscheme of things celestial.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. GLOBULAR CLUSTER IN THE CENTAUR.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rank of the Earth as a Globe in Space.\r\n\r\nLet me give an illustration with the view of explaining more fully the\r\nnature of the relation which the earth bears to the other globes which\r\nabound through space, and you must allow me to draw a little upon my\r\nimagination. I shall suppose that the mails of our country extend not\r\nonly over this globe, but that they also communicate with other\r\nworlds; that postal arrangements exist between Mars and the earth,\r\nbetween the sun and Orion--in fact, everywhere throughout the whole\r\nextent of the universe. We shall consider how our letters are to be\r\naddressed. Let us take the case of Mr. John Smith, merchant, who lives\r\nat 1001, Piccadilly; and let us suppose that Mr. John Smith's business\r\ntransactions are of such an extensive nature that they reach not only\r\nall over this globe, but away throughout space. I shall suppose that\r\nthe firm has a correspondent residing--let us say in the constellation\r\nof the Great Bear; and when this man of business wants to write to Mr.\r\nSmith from these remote regions, what address must he put upon the\r\nletter, so that the Postmaster-General of the universe shall make no\r\nmistake about its delivery? He will write as follows:--\r\n\r\n  MR. JOHN SMITH,\r\n    1001 Piccadilly,\r\n      London,\r\n        England,\r\n          Europe,\r\n            Earth,\r\n              Near the Sun,\r\n                Milky Way,\r\n                  The Universe.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what the several lines of this address mean. Of course\r\nwe put down the name of Mr. John Smith in the first line, and then we\r\nwill add \"1001 Piccadilly\" for the second; but as the people in the\r\nGreat Bear are not likely to know where Piccadilly is, we shall add\r\n\"London\" underneath. As even London itself cannot be well known\r\neverywhere, it is better to write \"England.\" This would surely find\r\nMr. John Smith from any post-office on this globe. From other globes,\r\nhowever, the supreme importance of England may not be so immediately\r\nrecognized, and therefore it is as well to add another line, \"Europe.\"\r\nThis ought to be sufficient, I think, for any post-office in the solar\r\nsystem. Europe is big enough to be visible from Mars or Venus, and\r\nshould be known to the post-office people there, just as we know and\r\nhave names for the continents on Mars. But further away there might be\r\na little difficulty; from Uranus and Neptune the different regions on\r\nour earth can never have been distinguished, and therefore we must add\r\nanother line to indicate the particular globe of the solar system\r\nwhich contains Europe. Mark Twain tells us that there was always one\r\nthing in astronomy which specially puzzled him, and that was to know\r\nhow we found out the names of the stars. We are, of course, in\r\nhopeless ignorance of the name by which this earth is called among\r\nother intelligent beings elsewhere who can see it. I can only adopt\r\nthe title of \"Earth,\" and therefore I add this line. Now our address\r\nis so complete that from anywhere in the solar system--from Mercury,\r\nfrom Jupiter, or Neptune--there ought to be no mistake about the\r\nletter finding its way to Mr. John Smith. But from his correspondent\r\nin the Great Bear this address would be still incomplete; they cannot\r\nsee our earth from there, and even the sun himself only looks like a\r\nsmall star--like one, in fact, of thousands of stars elsewhere.\r\nHowever, each star can be distinguished, and our sun may, for\r\ninstance, be recognized from the Great Bear by some designation. We\r\nshall add the line \"Near the Sun,\" and then I think that from this\r\nconstellation, or from any of the other stars around us, the address\r\nof Mr. John Smith may be regarded as complete. But Mr. Smith's\r\ncorrespondence may be still wider. He may have an agent living in the\r\ncluster of Perseus or on some other objects still fainter and more\r\ndistant; then \"Near the Sun\" is utterly inadequate as a concluding\r\nline to the address, for the sun, if it can be seen at all from\r\nthence, will be only of the significance of an excessively minute\r\nstar, no more to be designated by a special name than are each of the\r\nseveral leaves on the trees of a forest. What this distant\r\ncorrespondent will be acquainted with is not the earth or the sun but\r\nonly the cluster of stars among which the sun is but a unit. Again we\r\nuse our own name to denote the cluster, and we call it the \"Milky\r\nWay.\" When we add this line, we have made the address of Mr. John\r\nSmith as complete as circumstances will permit. I think a letter\r\nposted to him anywhere ought to reach its destination. To perfect it,\r\nhowever, we will finish up with one line more--\"The Universe.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Distances of the Stars.\r\n\r\nI must now tell you something about the distances of the stars. I\r\nshall not make the attempt to explain fully how astronomers make such\r\nmeasurements, but I will give you some notion of how it is done. You\r\nmay remember I showed you how we found the distance of a globe that\r\nwas hung from the ceiling. The principle of the method for finding the\r\ndistance of a star is somewhat similar, except that we make the two\r\nobservations not from the two ends of a table, not even from opposite\r\nsides of the earth, but from two opposite points on the earth's orbit,\r\nwhich are therefore at a distance of one hundred and eighty-six\r\nmillion miles. Imagine that on Midsummer Day, when standing on the\r\nearth here, I measure with a piece of card the angle between the star\r\nand the sun. Six months later, on Midwinter Day, when the earth is at\r\nthe opposite point of its orbit, I again measure the angle between the\r\nsame star and the sun, and we can now determine the star's distance by\r\nmaking a triangle. I draw a line a foot long, and we will take this\r\nfoot to represent one hundred and eighty-six million miles, the\r\ndistance between the two stations; then placing the cards at the\r\ncorners, I rule the two sides and complete the triangle, and the star\r\nmust be at the remaining corner; then I measure the sides of the\r\ntriangle, and how many feet they contain, and recollecting that each\r\nfoot corresponds to one hundred and eighty-six million miles, we\r\ndiscover the distance of the star. If the stars were comparatively\r\nnear us, the process would be a very simple one; but, unfortunately,\r\nthe stars are so extremely far off that this triangle, even with a\r\nbase of only one foot, must have its sides many miles long. Indeed,\r\nastronomers will tell you that there is no more delicate or\r\ntroublesome work in the whole of their science than that of\r\ndiscovering the distance of a star.\r\n\r\nIn all such measurements we take the distance from the earth to the\r\nsun as a conveniently long measuring-rod, whereby to express the\r\nresults. The nearest stars are still hundreds of thousands of times as\r\nfar off as the sun. Let us ponder for a little on the vastness of\r\nthese distances. We shall first express them in miles. Taking the\r\nsun's distance to be ninety-three million miles, then the distance of\r\nthe nearest fixed star is about twenty millions of millions of\r\nmiles--that is to say, we express this by putting down a 2 first, and\r\nthen writing thirteen ciphers after it. It is, no doubt, easy to speak\r\nof such figures, but it is a very different matter when we endeavor to\r\nimagine the awful magnitude which such a number indicates. I must try\r\nto give some illustrations which will enable you to form a notion of\r\nit. At first I was going to ask you to try and count this number, but\r\nwhen I found it would require at least three hundred thousand years,\r\ncounting day and night without stopping, before the task was over, it\r\nbecame necessary to adopt some other method.\r\n\r\nWhen on a visit in Lancashire I was once kindly permitted to visit a\r\ncotton mill, and I learned that the cotton yarn there produced in a\r\nsingle day would be long enough to wind round this earth twenty-seven\r\ntimes at the equator. It appears that the total production of cotton\r\nyarn each day in all the mills together would be on the average about\r\none hundred and fifty-five million miles. In fact, if they would only\r\nspin about one-fifth more, we could assert that Great Britain produced\r\nenough cotton yarn every day to stretch from the earth to the sun and\r\nback again! It is not hard to find from these figures how long it\r\nwould take for all the mills in Lancashire to produce a piece of yarn\r\nlong enough to reach from our earth to the nearest of the stars. If\r\nthe spinners worked as hard as ever they could for a year, and if all\r\nthe pieces were then tied together, they would extend to only a small\r\nfraction of the distance; nor if they worked for ten years, or for\r\ntwenty years, would the task be fully accomplished. Indeed, upwards of\r\nfour hundred years would be necessary before enough cotton could be\r\ngrown in America and spun in this country to stretch over a distance\r\nso enormous. All the spinning that has ever yet been done in the world\r\nhas not formed a long enough thread!\r\n\r\nThere is another way in which we can form some notion of the immensity\r\nof these sidereal distances. You will recollect that, when we were\r\nspeaking of Jupiter's moons, I told you of the beautiful discovery\r\nwhich their eclipses enabled astronomers to make. It was thus found\r\nthat light travels at the enormous speed of about one hundred and\r\neighty-five thousand miles per second. It moves so quickly that within\r\na single second a ray would flash two hundred times from London to\r\nEdinburgh and back again.\r\n\r\nWe said that a meteor travels one hundred times as swiftly as a\r\nrifle-bullet; but even this great speed seems almost nothing when\r\ncompared with the speed of light, which is ten thousand times as\r\ngreat. Suppose some brilliant outbreak of light were to take place in\r\na distant star--an outbreak which would be of such intensity that the\r\nflash from it would extend far and wide throughout the universe. The\r\nlight would start forth on its voyage with terrific speed. Any\r\nneighboring star which was at a distance of less than one hundred and\r\neighty-five thousand miles would, of course, see the flash within a\r\nsecond after it had been produced. More distant bodies would receive\r\nthe intimation after intervals of time proportioned to their\r\ndistances. Thus, if a body were one million miles away, the light\r\nwould reach it in from five to six seconds, while over a distance as\r\ngreat as that which separates the earth from the sun the news would be\r\ncarried in about eight minutes. We can calculate how long a time must\r\nelapse ere the light shall travel over a distance so great as that\r\nbetween the star and our earth. You will find that from the nearest of\r\nthe stars the time required for the journey will be over three years.\r\nPonder on all that this involves. That outbreak in the star might be\r\ngreat enough to be visible here, but we could never become aware of it\r\ntill three years after it had happened. When we are looking at such a\r\nstar to-night we do not see it as it is at present, for the light that\r\nis at this moment entering our eyes has travelled so far that it has\r\nbeen three years on the way. Therefore, when we look at the star now\r\nwe see it as it was three years previously. In fact, if the star were\r\nto go out altogether, we might still continue to see it twinkling for\r\na period of three years longer, because a certain amount of light was\r\non its way to us at the moment of extinction, and so long as that\r\nlight keeps arriving here, so long shall we see the star showing as\r\nbrightly as ever. When, therefore, you look at the thousands of stars\r\nin the sky to-night, there is not one that you see as it is now, but\r\nas it was years ago.\r\n\r\nI have been speaking of the stars that are nearest to us, but there\r\nare others much farther off. It is true we cannot find the distances\r\nof these more remote objects with any degree of accuracy, but we can\r\nconvince ourselves how great that distance is by the following\r\nreasoning. Look at one of the brightest stars. Try to conceive that\r\nthe object was carried away further into the depths of space, until it\r\nwas ten times as far from us as it is at present, it would still\r\nremain bright enough to be recognized in quite a small telescope; even\r\nif it were taken to one hundred times its original distance it would\r\nnot have withdrawn from the view of a good telescope; while if it\r\nretreated one thousand times as far as it was at first it would still\r\nbe a recognizable point in our mightiest instruments. Among the stars\r\nwhich we can see with our telescopes, we feel confident there must be\r\nmany from which the light has expended hundreds of years, or even\r\nthousands of years, on the journey. When, therefore, we look at such\r\nobjects, we see them, not as they are now, but as they were ages ago;\r\nin fact, a star might have ceased to exist for thousands of years, and\r\nstill be seen by us every night as a twinkling point in our great\r\ntelescopes.\r\n\r\nRemembering these facts, you will, I think, look at the heavens with a\r\nnew interest. There is a bright star, Vega, or Alpha Lyræ, a beautiful\r\ngem, so far off that the light from it which now reaches our eyes\r\nstarted before many of my audience were born. Suppose that there are\r\nastronomers residing on worlds amid the stars, and that they have\r\nsufficiently powerful telescopes to view this globe, what do you think\r\nthey would observe? They will not see our earth as it is at present;\r\nthey will see it as it was years (and sometimes many years) ago. There\r\nare stars from which if England could now be seen, the whole of the\r\ncountry would be observed at this present moment to be in a great\r\nstate of excitement at a very auspicious event. Distant astronomers\r\nmight notice a great procession in London, and they could watch the\r\ncoronation of a youthful queen amid the enthusiasm of a nation. There\r\nare other stars still further, from which, if the inhabitants had good\r\nenough telescopes, they would now see a mighty battle in progress not\r\nfar from Brussels. One splendid army could be beheld hurling itself\r\ntime after time against the immovable ranks of the other. They would\r\nnot, indeed, be able to hear the ever-memorable \"Up, Guards, and at\r\nthem!\" but there can be no doubt that there are stars so far away that\r\nthe rays of light which started from the earth on the day of the\r\nbattle of Waterloo are only just arriving there. Further off still,\r\nthere are stars from which a bird's-eye view could be taken at this\r\nvery moment of the signing of Magna Charta. There are even stars from\r\nwhich England, if it could be seen at all, would now appear, not as\r\nthe great England we know, but as a country covered by dense forests,\r\nand inhabited by painted savages, who waged incessant war with wild\r\nbeasts that roamed through the island. The geological problems that\r\nnow puzzle us would be quickly solved could we only go far enough into\r\nspace and had we only powerful enough telescopes. We should then be\r\nable to view our earth through the successive epochs of past\r\ngeological time; we should be actually able to see those great animals\r\nwhose fossil remains are treasured in our museums tramping about over\r\nthe earth's surface, splashing across its swamps, or swimming with\r\nbroad flippers through its oceans. Indeed, if we could view our own\r\nearth reflected from mirrors in the stars, we might still see Moses\r\ncrossing the Red Sea, or Adam and Eve being expelled from Eden.\r\n\r\nSo important is the subject of star distance that I am tempted to give\r\none more illustration in order to bring before you some conception of\r\nhow vast such distances are. I shall take, as before, the nearest of\r\nthe stars so far as known to us, and I hope to be forgiven for taking\r\nan illustration of a practical and a commercial kind instead of one\r\nmore purely scientific. I shall suppose that a railway is about to be\r\nmade from London to Alpha Centauri. The length of that railway, of\r\ncourse, we have already stated: it is twenty billions of miles. So I\r\nam now going to ask your attention to the simple question as to the\r\nfare which it would be reasonable to charge for the journey. We shall\r\nchoose a very cheap scale on which to compute the price of a ticket.\r\nThe parliamentary rate here is, I believe, a penny for every mile. We\r\nwill make our interstellar railway fares much less even than this; we\r\nshall arrange to travel at the rate of one hundred miles for every\r\npenny. That, surely, is moderate enough. If the charges were so low\r\nthat the journey from London to Edinburgh only cost fourpence, then\r\neven the most unreasonable passenger would be surely contented. On\r\nthese terms how much do you think the fare from London to this star\r\nought to be? I know of one way in which to make our answer\r\nintelligible. There is a National Debt with which your fathers are,\r\nunhappily, only too well acquainted; you will know quite enough about\r\nit yourselves in those days when you have to pay income tax. This debt\r\nis so vast that the interest upon it is about sixty thousand pounds a\r\nday, the whole amount of the National Debt being six hundred and\r\nthirty-eight millions of pounds.\r\n\r\nIf you went to the booking-office with the whole of this mighty sum in\r\nyour pocket--but stop a moment; could you carry it in your pocket?\r\nCertainly not, if it were in sovereigns. You would find that after you\r\nhad as many sovereigns as you could conveniently carry there would\r\nstill be some left--so many, indeed, that it would be necessary to get\r\na cart to help you on with the rest. When the cart had as great a load\r\nof sovereigns as the horse could draw there would be still some more,\r\nand you would have to get another cart; but ten carts, twenty carts,\r\nfifty carts, would not be enough. You would want five thousand of\r\nthese before you would be able to move off towards the station with\r\nyour money. When you did get there and asked for a ticket at the rate\r\nof one hundred miles for a penny, do you think you would get any\r\nchange? No doubt some little time would be required to count the\r\nmoney, but when it was counted the clerk would tell you that there was\r\nnot enough--that he must have nearly two hundred millions of pounds\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThat will give some notion of the distance of the nearest star, and we\r\nmay multiply it by ten, by one hundred, and even by one thousand, and\r\nstill not attain to the distance of some of the more remote stars that\r\nthe telescope shows us.\r\n\r\nOn account of the immense distances of the stars we can only perceive\r\nthem to be mere points of light. We can never see a star to be a globe\r\nwith marks on it like the moon, or like one of the planets--in fact,\r\nthe better the telescope the smaller does the star seem, though, of\r\ncourse, its brightness is increased with every addition to the\r\nlight-grasping power of the instrument.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Brightness and Color of Stars.\r\n\r\nAnother point to be noticed is the arrangement of stars in classes,\r\naccording to their lustre. The brightest stars, of which there are\r\nabout twenty, are said to be of the first magnitude. Those just\r\ninferior to the first magnitude are ranked as the second; and those\r\njust lower than the second are estimated as the third; and so on. The\r\nsmallest points that your unaided eyes will show you are of about the\r\nsixth magnitude. Then the telescope will reveal stars still fainter\r\nand fainter, down to what we term the seventeenth or eighteenth\r\nmagnitudes, or even lower still. The number of stars of each magnitude\r\nincreases very much in the classes of small ones.\r\n\r\nMost of the stars are white, but many are of a somewhat ruddy hue.\r\nThere are a few telescopic points which are intensely red, some\r\nexhibit beautiful golden tints, while others are blue or green.\r\n\r\nThere are some curious stars which regularly change their brilliancy.\r\nLet me try to illustrate the nature of these variables. Suppose that\r\nyou were looking at a street gas-lamp from a very long distance, so\r\nthat it seemed a little twinkling light; and suppose that some one was\r\npreparing to turn the gas-cock up and down. Or, better still, imagine\r\na little machine which would act regularly so as to keep the light\r\nfirst of all at its full brightness for two days and a half, and then\r\ngradually turn it down until in three or four hours it declines to a\r\nfeeble glimmer. In this low state the light remains for twenty\r\nminutes; then during three or four hours the gas is to be slowly\r\nturned on again until it is full. In this condition the light will\r\nremain for two days and a half, and then the same series of changes is\r\nto recommence. This would be a very odd form of gas-lamp. There would\r\nbe periods of two days and a half during which it would remain at its\r\nfull; these would be separated by intervals of about seven hours, when\r\nthe gradual turning down and turning up again would be in progress.\r\n\r\nThe imaginary gas-lamp is exactly paralleled by a star Algol, in the\r\nconstellation of Perseus (Fig. 3), which goes through the series of\r\nchanges I have indicated. Ordinarily speaking, it is a bright star of\r\nthe second magnitude, and, whatever be the cause, the star performs\r\nits variations with marvellous uniformity. In fact, Algol has always\r\narrested the attention of those who observed the heavens, and in early\r\ntimes was looked on as the eye of a demon. There are many other stars\r\nwhich also change their brilliancy. Most of them require much longer\r\nperiods than Algol, and sometimes a new star which nobody has ever\r\nseen before will suddenly kindle into brilliancy. It is now known that\r\nthe bright star Algol is attended by a dark companion. This dark star\r\nsometimes comes between Algol and the observer and cuts off the light.\r\nThus it is that the diminution of brightness is produced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. PERSEUS AND ITS NEIGHBORING STARS INCLUDING\r\nALGOL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDouble Stars.\r\n\r\nWhenever you have a chance of looking at the heavens through a\r\ntelescope, you should ask to be shown what is called _a double star_.\r\nThere are many stars in the heavens which present no remarkable\r\nappearance to the unaided eye, but which a good telescope at once\r\nshows to be of quite a complex nature. These are what we call double\r\nstars, in which two quite distinct stars are placed so close together\r\nthat the unaided eye is unable to separate them. Under the magnifying\r\npower of the telescope, however, they are seen to be distinct. In\r\norder to give some notion of what these objects are like, I shall\r\nbriefly describe three of them. The first lies in that best known\r\nconstellation, the Great Bear. If you look at his tail, which consists\r\nof three stars, you will see that near the middle one of the three a\r\nsmall star is situated; we call this little star Alcor, but it is the\r\nbrighter one near Alcor to which I specially call your attention. The\r\nsharpest eye would never suspect that it was composed of two stars\r\nplaced close together. Even a small telescope will, however, show this\r\nto be the case, and this is the easiest and the first observation that\r\na young astronomer should make when beginning to turn a telescope to\r\nthe heavens. Of course you will not imagine that I mean Alcor to be\r\nthe second component of the double star; it is the bright star near\r\nAlcor which is the double. Here are two marbles, and these marbles are\r\nfastened an inch apart. You can see them, of course, to be separate;\r\nbut if the pair were moved further and further away, then you would\r\nsoon not be able to distinguish between them, though the actual\r\ndistance between the marbles had not altered. Look at these two wax\r\ntapers which are now lighted; the little flames are an inch apart. You\r\nwould have to view them from a station a third of a mile away if the\r\ndistance between the two flames were to appear the same as that\r\nbetween the two components of this double star. Your eye would never\r\nbe able to discriminate between two lights only an inch apart at so\r\ngreat a distance; a telescope would, however, enable you to do so, and\r\nthis is the reason why we have to use telescopes to show us double\r\nstars.\r\n\r\nYou might look at that double star year after year throughout the\r\ncourse of a long life without finding any appreciable change in the\r\nrelative positions of its components. But we know that there is no\r\nsuch thing as rest in the universe; even if you could balance a body\r\nso as to leave it for a moment at rest, it would not stay there, for\r\nthe simple reason that all the bodies round it in every direction are\r\npulling at it, and it is certain that the pull in one direction will\r\npreponderate, so that move it must. Especially is this true in the\r\ncase of two suns like those forming a double star. Placed\r\ncomparatively near each other they could not remain permanently in\r\nthat position; they must gradually draw together and come into\r\ncollision with an awful crash. There is only one way by which such a\r\ndisaster could be averted. That is by making one of these stars\r\nrevolve around the other just as the earth revolves around the sun, or\r\nthe moon revolves around the earth. Some motion must, therefore, be\r\ngoing on in every genuine double star, whether we have been able to\r\nsee that motion or not.\r\n\r\nLet us now look at another double star of a different kind. This time\r\nit is in the constellation of Gemini. The heavenly twins are called\r\nCastor and Pollux. Of these, Castor is a very beautiful double star,\r\nconsisting of two bright points, a great deal closer together than\r\nwere those in the Great Bear; consequently a better telescope is\r\nrequired for the purpose of showing them separately. Castor has been\r\nwatched for many years, and it can be seen that one of these stars is\r\nslowly revolving around the other; but it takes a very long time,\r\namounting to hundreds of years, for a complete circuit to be\r\naccomplished. This seems very astonishing, but when you remember how\r\nexceedingly far Castor is, you will perceive that that pair of stars\r\nwhich appear so close together that it requires a telescope to show\r\nthem apart must indeed be separated by hundreds of millions of miles.\r\nLet us try to conceive our own system transformed into a double star.\r\nIf we took our outermost planet--Neptune--and enlarged him a good\r\ndeal, and then heated him sufficiently to make him glow like a sun, he\r\nwould still continue to revolve round our sun at the same distance,\r\nand thus a double star would be produced. An inhabitant of Castor who\r\nturned his telescope towards us would be able to see the sun as a\r\nstar. He would not, of course, be able to see the earth, but he might\r\nsee Neptune like another small star close to the sun. If generations\r\nof astronomers in Castor continued their observations of our system,\r\nthey would find a binary star, of which one component took a century\r\nand a half to go round the other. Need we then be surprised that when\r\nwe look at Castor we observe movements that seem very slow?\r\n\r\nThere is often so much diffused light about the bright stars seen in a\r\ntelescope, and so much twinkling in some states of the atmosphere,\r\nthat stars appear to dance about in rather a puzzling fashion,\r\nespecially to one who is not accustomed to astronomical observations.\r\nI remember hearing how a gentleman once came to visit an observatory.\r\nThe astronomer showed him Castor through a powerful telescope as a\r\nfine specimen of a double star, and then, by way of improving his\r\nlittle lesson, the astronomer mentioned that one of these stars was\r\nrevolving around the other. \"Oh, yes,\" said the visitor, \"I saw them\r\ngoing round and round in the telescope.\" He would, however, have had\r\nto wait for a few centuries with his eye to the instrument before he\r\nwould have been entitled to make this assertion.\r\n\r\nDouble stars also frequently delight us by giving beautifully\r\ncontrasted colors. I dare say you have often noticed the red and the\r\ngreen lights that are used on railways in the signal lamps. Imagine\r\none of those red and one of those green lights away far up in the sky\r\nand placed close together, then you would have some idea of the\r\nappearance that a colored double star presents, though, perhaps, I\r\nshould add that the hues in the heavenly bodies are not so vividly\r\ndifferent as are those which our railway people find necessary. There\r\nis a particularly beautiful double star of this kind in the\r\nconstellation of the Swan. You could make an imitation of it by boring\r\ntwo holes, with a red-hot needle, in a piece of card, and then\r\ncovering one of these holes with a small bit of the topaz-colored\r\ngelatine with which Christmas crackers are made. The other star is to\r\nbe similarly colored with blue gelatine. A slide made on this\r\nprinciple placed in the lantern gives a very good representation of\r\nthese two stars on the screen. There are many other colored doubles\r\nbesides this one; and, indeed, it is noteworthy that we hardly ever\r\nfind a blue or a green star by itself in the sky; it is always as a\r\nmember of one of these pairs.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow We Find What the Stars are Made of.\r\n\r\nHere is a piece of stone. If I wanted to know what it was composed of,\r\nI should ask a chemist to tell me. He would take it into his\r\nlaboratory, and first crush it into powder, and then, with his test\r\ntubes, and with the liquids which his bottles contain, and his\r\nweighing scales, and other apparatus, he would tell all about it;\r\nthere is so much of this, and so much of that, and plenty of this, and\r\nnone at all of that. But now, suppose you ask this chemist to tell you\r\nwhat the sun is made of, or one of the stars. Of course, you have not\r\na sample of it to give him; how, then, can he possibly find out\r\nanything about it? Well, he can tell you something, and this is the\r\nwonderful discovery that I want to explain to you. We now put down the\r\ngas, and I kindle a brilliant red light. Perhaps some of those whom I\r\nsee before me have occasionally ventured on the somewhat dangerous\r\npractice of making fire-works. If there is any boy here who has ever\r\nconstructed sky-rockets, and put the little balls into the top which\r\nare to burn with such vivid colors when the explosion takes place, he\r\nwill know that the substance which tinged that fire red must have been\r\nstrontium. He will recognize it by the color; because strontium gives\r\na red light which nothing else will give. Here are some of these\r\nlightning papers, as they are called; they are very pretty and very\r\nharmless; and these, too, give brilliant red flashes as I throw them.\r\nThe red tint has, no doubt, been produced by strontium also. You see\r\nwe recognized the substance simply by the color of the light it\r\nproduced when burning.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of you have tried to make a ghost at Christmas by\r\ndressing up in a sheet, and bearing in your hand a ladle blazing with\r\na mixture of common salt and spirits of wine, the effect produced\r\nbeing a most ghastly one. Some mammas will hardly thank me for this\r\nsuggestion, unless I add that the ghost must walk about cautiously,\r\nfor otherwise the blazing spirit would be very apt to produce\r\nconflagrations of a kind more extensive than those intended. However,\r\nby the kindness of Professor Dewar, I am enabled to show the\r\nphenomenon on a splendid scale, and also free from all danger. I\r\nkindle a vivid flame of an intensely yellow color, which I think the\r\nladies will unanimously agree is not at all becoming to their\r\ncomplexions, while the pretty dresses have lost their variety of\r\ncolors. Here is a nice bouquet, and yet you can hardly distinguish the\r\ngreen of the leaves from the brilliant colors of the flowers, except\r\nby trifling differences of shade. Expose to this light a number of\r\npieces of variously colored ribbon, pink and red and green and blue,\r\nand their beauty is gone; and yet we are told that this yellow is a\r\nperfectly pure color; in fact, the purest color that can be produced.\r\nI think we have to be thankful that the light which our good sun sends\r\nus does not possess purity of that description. There is one substance\r\nwhich will produce that yellow light; it is a curious metal called\r\nsodium--a metal so soft that you can cut it with a knife, and so light\r\nthat it will float on water; while, still more strange, it actually\r\ntakes fire the moment it is dropped on the water. It is only in a\r\nchemical laboratory that you will be likely to meet with the actual\r\nmetallic sodium, yet in other forms the substance is one of the most\r\nabundant in nature. Indeed, common salt is nothing but sodium closely\r\nunited with a most poisonous gas, a few respirations of which would\r\nkill you. But this strange metal and this noxious gas, when united,\r\nbecome simply the salt for our eggs at breakfast. This pure yellow\r\nlight, wherever it is seen, either in the flame of spirits of wine\r\nmixed with salt or in that great blaze at which we have been looking,\r\nis characteristic of sodium. Wherever you see that particular kind of\r\nlight, you know that sodium must have been present in the body from\r\nwhich it came.\r\n\r\nWe have accordingly learned to recognize two substances, namely,\r\nstrontium and sodium, by the different lights which they give out when\r\nburning. To these two metals we may add a third. Here is a strip of\r\nwhite metallic ribbon. It is called magnesium. It seems like a bit of\r\ntin at the first glance, but indeed it is a very different substance\r\nfrom tin; for, look, when I hold it in the spirit-lamp, the strip of\r\nmetal immediately takes fire, and burns with a white light so dazzling\r\nthat it pales the gas-flames to insignificance. There is no other\r\nsubstance which will, when kindled, give that particular kind of light\r\nwhich we see from magnesium. I can recommend this little experiment as\r\nquite suitable for trying at home; you can buy a bit of magnesium\r\nribbon for a trifle at the opticians; it cannot explode or do any\r\nharm, nor will you get into any trouble with the authorities provided\r\nyou hold it when burning over a tray or a newspaper, so as to prevent\r\nthe white ashes from falling on the carpet.\r\n\r\nThere are, in nature, a number of simple bodies called elements.\r\nEvery one of these, when ignited under suitable conditions, emits a\r\nlight which belongs to it alone, and by which it can be distinguished\r\nfrom every other substance. I do not say that we can try the\r\nexperiments in the simple way I have here indicated. Many of the\r\nmaterials will yield light which will require to be studied by much\r\nmore elaborate artifices than those which have sufficed for us. But\r\nyou will see that the method affords a means of finding out the actual\r\nsubstances present in the sun or in the stars. There is a practical\r\ndifficulty in the fact that each of the heavenly bodies contains a\r\nnumber of different elements; so that in the light it sends us the\r\nhues arising from distinct substances are blended into one beam. The\r\nfirst thing to be done is to get some way of splitting up a beam of\r\nlight, so as to discover the components of which it is made. You might\r\nhave a skein of silks of different hues tangled together, and this\r\nwould be like the sunbeam as we receive it in its unsorted condition.\r\nHow shall we untangle the light from the sun or a star? I will show\r\nyou by a simple experiment. Here is a beam from the electric light;\r\nbeautifully white and bright, is it not? It looks so pure and simple,\r\nbut yet that beam is composed of all sorts of colors mingled together,\r\nin such proportions as to form white light. I take a wedge-shaped\r\npiece of glass called a prism, and when I introduce it into the course\r\nof the beam, you see the transformation that has taken place (Fig. 4).\r\nInstead of the white light you have now all the colors of the\r\nrainbow--red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, marked by\r\ntheir initial letters in the figure. These colors are very beautiful,\r\nbut they are transient, for the moment we take away the prism they\r\nall unite again to form white light. You see what the prism has done;\r\nit has bent all the light in passing through it; but it is more\r\neffective in bending the blue than the red, and consequently the blue\r\nis carried away much further than the red. Such is the way in which we\r\nstudy the composition of a heavenly body. We take a beam of its light,\r\nwe pass it through a prism, and immediately it is separated into its\r\ncomponents; then we compare what we find with the lights given by the\r\ndifferent elements, and thus we are enabled to discover the substances\r\nwhich exist in the distant object whose light we have examined. I do\r\nnot mean to say that the method is a simple one; all I am endeavoring\r\nto show is a general outline of the way in which we have discovered\r\nthe materials present in the stars. The instrument that is employed\r\nfor this purpose is called the spectroscope. And perhaps you may\r\nremember that name by these lines, which I have heard from an\r\nastronomical friend:--\r\n\r\n  \"Twinkle, twinkle, little star,\r\n  Now we find out what you are,\r\n  When unto the midnight sky,\r\n  We the spectroscope apply.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. HOW A RAY OF LIGHT IS SPLIT UP.]\r\n\r\nI am sure it will interest everybody to know that the elements which\r\nthe stars contain are not altogether different from those of which the\r\nearth is made. It is true there may be substances in the stars of\r\nwhich we know nothing here; but it is certain that many of the most\r\ncommon elements on the earth are present in the most distant bodies. I\r\nshall only mention one, the metal iron. That useful substance has been\r\nfound in some of the stars which lie at almost incalculable distances\r\nfrom the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nebulæ.\r\n\r\nIn drawing towards the close of these lectures I must say a few words\r\nabout some dim and mysterious objects to which we have not yet\r\nalluded. They are what are called nebulæ, or little clouds; and in\r\none sense they are justly called little, for each of them occupies but\r\na very small spot in the sky as compared with that which would be\r\nfilled by an ordinary cloud in our air. The nebulæ are, however,\r\nobjects of the most stupendous proportions. Were our earth and\r\nthousands of millions of bodies quite as big all put together, they\r\nwould not be nearly so great as one of these nebulæ. Astronomers\r\nreckon up the various nebulæ by thousands, but I must add that most of\r\nthem are apparently faint and uninteresting. A nebula is sometimes\r\nliable to be mistaken for a comet. The comet is, as I have already\r\nexplained, at once distinguished by the fact that it is moving and\r\nchanging its appearance from hour to hour, while scores of years\r\nelapse without changes in the aspect or position of a nebula. The most\r\npowerful telescopes are employed in observing these faint objects. I\r\ntake this opportunity of showing a picture of an instrument suitable\r\nfor such observations. It is the great reflector of the Paris\r\nObservatory (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. A GREAT REFLECTING TELESCOPE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. THE RING NEBULA IN LYRA, UNDER DIFFERENT\r\nTELESCOPIC POWERS.]\r\n\r\nThere are such multitudes of nebulæ that I can only show a few of the\r\nmore remarkable kinds. In Fig. 6 will be seen pictures of a curious\r\nobject in the constellation of Lyra seen under different telescopic\r\npowers. This is a gigantic ring of luminous gas. To judge of the size\r\nof this ring let us suppose that a railway were laid across it, and\r\nthe train you entered at one side was not to stop until it reached the\r\nother side, how long do you think this journey would require? I\r\nrecollect some time ago a picture in _Punch_ which showed a train\r\nabout to start from London to Brighton, and the guard walking up and\r\ndown announcing to the passengers the alarming fact that \"this train\r\nstops nowhere.\" An old gentleman was seen vainly gesticulating out of\r\nthe window and imploring to be let out ere the frightful journey was\r\ncommenced. In the nebular railway the passengers would almost require\r\nsuch a warning.\r\n\r\nLet the train start at a speed of a mile a minute, you would think,\r\nsurely, that it must soon cross the ring. But the minutes pass, an\r\nhour has elapsed; so the distance must be sixty miles at all events.\r\nThe hours creep on into days, the days advance into years, and still\r\nthe train goes on. The years would lengthen out into centuries, and\r\neven when the train had been rushing on for a thousand years with an\r\nunabated speed of a mile a minute, the journey would certainly not\r\nhave been completed. Nor do I venture to say what ages must elapse ere\r\nthe terminus at the other side of the ring nebula would be reached.\r\n\r\nA cluster of stars viewed in a small telescope will often seem like a\r\nnebula, for the rays of the stars become blended. A powerful telescope\r\nwill, however, dispel the illusion and reveal the separate stars. It\r\nwas, therefore, thought that all the nebulæ might be merely clusters\r\nso exceedingly remote that our mightiest instruments failed to resolve\r\nthem into stars. But this is now known not to be the case. Many of\r\nthese objects are really masses of glowing gas; such are, for\r\ninstance, the ring nebulæ, of which I have just spoken, and the form\r\nof which I can simulate by a pretty experiment.\r\n\r\nWe take a large box with a round hole cut in one face, and a canvas\r\nback at the opposite side. I first fill this box with smoke, and there\r\nare different ways of doing so. Burning brown paper does not answer\r\nwell, because the supply of smoke is too irregular and the paper\r\nitself is apt to blaze. A little bit of phosphorus set on fire yields\r\ncopious smoke, but it would be apt to make people cough, and, besides,\r\nphosphorus is a dangerous thing to handle incautiously, and I do not\r\nwant to suggest anything which might be productive of disaster if the\r\nexperiment was repeated at home. A little wisp of hay, slightly damped\r\nand lighted, will safely yield a sufficient supply, and you need not\r\nhave an elaborate box like this; any kind of old packing-case, or even\r\na bandbox with a duster stretched across its open top and a round hole\r\ncut in the bottom, will answer capitally. While I have been speaking,\r\nmy assistant has kindly filled this box with smoke, and in order to\r\nhave a sufficient supply, and one which shall be as little\r\ndisagreeable as possible, he has mixed together the fumes of\r\nhydrochloric acid and ammonia from two retorts shown in Fig. 7. A\r\nstill simpler way of doing the same thing is to put a little common\r\nsalt in a saucer and pour over it a little oil of vitriol; this is put\r\ninto the box, and over the floor of the box common smelling-salts is\r\nto be scattered. You see there are dense volumes of white smoke\r\nescaping from every corner of the box. I uncover the opening and give\r\na push to the canvas, and you see a beautiful ring flying across the\r\nroom; another ring and another follows. If you were near enough to\r\nfeel the ring, you would experience a little puff of wind; I can show\r\nthis by blowing out a candle which is at the other end of the table.\r\nThese rings are made by the air which goes into a sort of eddy as it\r\npasses through the hole. All the smoke does is to render the air\r\nvisible. The smoke-ring is indeed quite elastic. If we send a second\r\nring hurriedly after the first, we can produce a collision, and you\r\nsee each of the two rings remains unbroken, though both are quivering\r\nfrom the effects of the blow. They are beautifully shown along the\r\nbeam of the electric lamp, or, better still, along a sunbeam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. HOW TO MAKE THE SMOKE RINGS.]\r\n\r\nWe can make many experiments with smoke-rings. Here, for instance, I\r\ntake an empty box, so far as smoke is concerned, but air-rings can be\r\ndriven forth from it, though you cannot see them, but you can feel\r\nthem even at the other side of the room, and they will, as you see,\r\nblow out a candle. I can also shoot invisible air-rings at a column of\r\nsmoke, and when the missile strikes the smoke it produces a little\r\ncommotion and emerges on the other side, carrying with it enough of\r\nthe smoke to render itself visible, while the solid black looking ring\r\nof air is seen in the interior. Still more striking is another way of\r\nproducing these rings, for I charge this box with ammonia, and the\r\nrings from it you cannot see. There is a column of the vapor of\r\nhydrochloric acid, that also you cannot see; but when the visible ring\r\nenters the invisible column, then a sudden union takes place between\r\nthe vapor of the ammonia and the vapor of the hydrochloric acid; the\r\nresult is a solid white substance in extremely fine dust which renders\r\nthe ring instantly visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the Nebulæ are made of.\r\n\r\nThere is a fundamental difference between the illumination of these\r\nlittle rings that I have shown you and the great rings in the heavens.\r\nI had to illuminate our smoke with the help of the electric light,\r\nfor, unless I had done so, you would not have been able to see them.\r\nThis white substance formed by the union of ammonia and hydrochloric\r\nacid has, of course, no more light of its own than a piece of chalk;\r\nit requires other light falling upon it to make it visible. Were the\r\nring nebula in Lyra composed of this material, we could not see it.\r\nThe sunlight which illuminates the planets might, of course, light up\r\nsuch an object as the ring, if it wrere comparatively near us; but\r\nLyra is at such a stupendous distance that any light which the sun\r\ncould send out there would be just as feeble as the light we receive\r\nfrom a fixed star. Should we be able to show our smoke-rings, for\r\ninstance, if, instead of having the electric light, I merely cut a\r\nhole in the ceiling and allowed the feeble twinkle of a star in the\r\nGreat Bear to shine through? In a similar way the sunbeams would be\r\nutterly powerless to effect any illumination of objects in these\r\nstellar distances. If the sun were to be extinguished altogether, the\r\ncalamity would no doubt be a very dire one so far as we are concerned,\r\nbut the effect on the other celestial bodies (moon and planets\r\nexcepted) would be of the slightest possible description. All the\r\nstars of heaven would continue to shine as before. Not a point in one\r\nof the constellations wrould be altered, not a variation in the\r\nbrightness, not a change in the hue of any star could be noticed. The\r\nthousands of nebulæ and clusters would be absolutely unaltered; in\r\nfact, the total extinction of the sun would be hardly remarked in the\r\nnewspapers published in the Pleiades or in Orion. There might possibly\r\nbe a little line somewhere in an odd corner to the effect \"Mr.\r\nSo-and-So, our well-known astronomer, has noticed that a tiny star,\r\ninconspicuous to the eye, and absolutely of no importance whatever,\r\nhas now become invisible.\"\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, it be not the sun which lights up this nebula, where\r\nelse can be the source of its illumination? There can be no other star\r\nin the neighborhood adequate to the purpose, for, of course, such an\r\nobject would be brilliant to us if it were large enough and bright\r\nenough to impart sufficient illumination to the nebula. It would be\r\nabsurd to say that you could see a man's face by the light of a candle\r\nwhile the candle itself was too faint or too distant to be visible.\r\nThe actual facts are, of course, the other way; the candle might be\r\nvisible, when it was impossible to discern the face which it lighted.\r\n\r\nHence we learn that the ring nebula must shine by some light of its\r\nown, and now we have to consider how it can be possible for such\r\nmaterial to be self-luminous. The light of a nebula does not seem to\r\nbe like flame; it can, perhaps, be better represented by the pretty\r\nelectrical experiment with Geissler's tubes. These are glass vessels\r\nof various shapes, and they are all very nearly empty, as you will\r\nunderstand when I tell you the way in which they have been prepared. A\r\nlittle gas was allowed into each tube, and then almost all the gas was\r\ntaken out again, so that only a mere trace was left. I pass a current\r\nof electricity through these tubes, and now you see they are glowing\r\nwith beautiful colors. The different gases give out lights of\r\ndifferent hues, and the optician has exerted his skill so as to make\r\nthe effect as beautiful as possible. The electricity, in passing\r\nthrough these tubes, heats the gas which they contain, and makes it\r\nglow; and just as this gas can, when heated sufficiently, give out\r\nlight, so does the great nebula, which is a mass of gas poised in\r\nspace, become visible in virtue of the heat which it contains.\r\n\r\nWe are not left quite in doubt as to the constitution of these gaseous\r\nnebulæ, for we can submit their light to the prism in the way I\r\nexplained when we were speaking of the stars. Distant though that ring\r\nin Lyra may be, it is interesting to learn that the ingredients from\r\nwhich it is made are not entirely different from substances we know on\r\nour earth. The water in this glass, and every drop of water, is formed\r\nby the union of two gases, of which one is hydrogen. This is an\r\nextremely light material, as you see by a little balloon which ascends\r\nso prettily when filled with it. Hydrogen also burns very readily,\r\nthough the flame is almost invisible. When I blow a jet of oxygen\r\nthrough the hydrogen, I produce a little flame with a very intense\r\nheat. For instance, I hold a steel pen in the flame, and it glows and\r\nsputters, and falls down in white-hot drops. It is needless to say\r\nthat, as a constituent of water, hydrogen is one of the most important\r\nelements on this earth. It is, therefore, of interest to learn that\r\nhydrogen in some form or other is a constituent of the most distant\r\nobjects in space that the telescope has revealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPhotographing the Nebulæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. THE PLEIADES.]\r\n\r\nOf late years we have learned a great deal about nebulæ, by the help\r\nwhich photography has given to us. Look at this group of stars which\r\nconstitutes that beautiful little configuration known as the Pleiades\r\n(Fig. 8). It looks like a miniature representation of the Great Bear;\r\nin fact, it would be far more appropriate to call the Pleiades the\r\nLittle Bear than to apply that title to another quite different\r\nconstellation, as has unfortunately been done. The Pleiades form a\r\ngroup containing six or seven stars visible to the ordinary eye,\r\nthough persons endowed with exceptionally good vision can usually see\r\na few more. In an opera-glass the Pleiades becomes a beautiful\r\nspectacle, though in a large telescope the stars appear too far apart\r\nto make a really effective cluster. When Mr. Roberts took a photograph\r\nof the Pleiades he placed a highly sensitive plate in his telescope,\r\nand on that plate the Pleiades engraved their picture with their own\r\nlight. He left the plate exposed for hours, and on developing it not\r\nonly were the stars seen, but there were also patches of faint light\r\ndue to the presence of nebulæ. It could not be said that the objects\r\non the plate were fallacious, for another photograph was taken, when\r\nthe same appearances were reproduced.\r\n\r\nWhen we look at that pretty group of stars which has attracted\r\nadmiration during all time, we are to think that some of those stars\r\nare merely the bright points in a vast nebula, invisible to our\r\nunaided eyes or even to our mighty telescopes, though capable of\r\nrecording its trace on the photographic plate. Does not this give us a\r\ngreatly increased notion of the extent of the universe, when we\r\nreflect that by photography we are enabled to see much which the\r\nmightiest of telescopes had previously failed to disclose?\r\n\r\nOf all the nebulæ, numbering some thousands, there is but a single one\r\nwhich can be seen without a telescope. It is in the constellation of\r\nAndromeda, and on a clear dark night can just be seen with the unaided\r\neye as a faint stain of light on the sky. It has happened before now\r\nthat persons noticing this nebula for the first time have thought they\r\nhad discovered a comet. I would like you to try and find out this\r\nobject for yourselves.\r\n\r\nIf you look at it with an opera-glass it appears to be distinctly\r\nelongated. You can see more of its structure when you view it in\r\nlarger instruments, but its nature was never made clear until some\r\nbeautiful photographs were taken by Mr. Roberts (Fig. 9).\r\nUnfortunately, the nebula in Andromeda has not been placed in the best\r\nposition for its portrait from our point of view. It seems as if it\r\nwere a rather flat-shaped object, turned nearly edgewise towards us.\r\nTo look at the pattern on a plate, you would naturally hold the plate\r\nso as to be able to look at it squarely. The pattern would not be seen\r\nwell if the plate were so tilted that its edge was turned towards you.\r\nThat seems to be nearly the way in which we are forced to view the\r\nnebula in Andromeda. We can trace in the photograph some divisions\r\nextending entirely round the nebula, showing that it seems to be\r\nformed of a series of rings; and there are some outlying portions\r\nwhich form part of the same system. Truly this is a marvellous object.\r\nIt is impossible for us to form any conception of the true dimensions\r\nof this gigantic nebula; it is so far off that we have never yet been\r\nable to determine its distance. Indeed, I may take this opportunity of\r\nremarking that no astronomer has yet succeeded in ascertaining the\r\ndistance of any nebula. Everything, however, points to the conclusion\r\nthat they are at least as far as the stars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. THE GREAT NEBULA IN ANDROMEDA.]\r\n\r\nIt is almost impossible to apply the methods which we use in finding\r\nthe distance of a star to the discovery of the distance of the\r\nnebulæ. These flimsy bodies are usually too ill-defined to admit of\r\nbeing measured with the precision and delicacy required for the\r\ndetermination of distance. The measurements necessary for this purpose\r\ncan only be made from one star-like point to another similar point. If\r\nwe could choose a star in the nebula and determine its distance, then\r\nof course, we have the distance of the nebula itself; but the\r\ndifficulty is that we have, in general, no means of knowing whether\r\nthe star does actually lie in the object. It may, for anything we can\r\ntell, lie billions of miles nearer to us, or billions of miles further\r\noff, and by merely happening to lie in the line of sight, appear to\r\nglimmer in the nebula itself.\r\n\r\nIf we have any assurance that the star is surrounded by a mass of this\r\nglowing vapor, then it may be possible to measure that nebula's\r\ndistance. It will occasionally happen that grounds can be found for\r\nbelieving that a star which appears to be in the glowing gas does\r\nveritably lie therein, and is not merely seen in the same direction.\r\nThere are hundreds of stars visible in a good drawing or a good\r\nphotograph of the famous object in Andromeda, and doubtless large\r\nnumbers of these are merely stars which happen to lie in the same line\r\nof sight. The peculiar circumstances attending the history of one star\r\nseem, however, to warrant us in making the assumption that it was\r\ncertainly in the nebula. The history of this star is a remarkable one.\r\nIt suddenly kindled from invisibility into brilliancy. How is a change\r\nso rapid in the lustre of a star to be accounted for? In a few days\r\nits brightness had undergone an extraordinary increase. Of course,\r\nthis does not tell us for certain that the star lay in the glowing\r\ngas; but the most rational explanation that I have heard offered of\r\nthis occurrence is that due, I believe, to my friend Mr. Monck. He has\r\nsuggested that the sudden outbreak in brilliancy might be accounted\r\nfor on the same principles as those by which we explain the ignition\r\nof meteors in our atmosphere. If a dark star, moving along with\r\nterrific speed through space, were suddenly to plunge into a dense\r\nregion of the nebula, heat and light must be evolved in sufficient\r\nabundance to transform the star into a brilliant object. If,\r\ntherefore, we knew the distance of this star at the time it was in\r\nAndromeda, we should, of course, learn the distance of that\r\ninteresting object. This has been attempted, and it has thus been\r\nproved that the Great Nebula must be very much further from us than is\r\nthat star of whose distance I attempted some time ago to give you a\r\nnotion.\r\n\r\nWe thus realize the enormous size of the Great Nebula. It appears that\r\nif, on a map of this object, we were to lay down, accurately to scale,\r\na map of the solar system, putting the sun in the centre and all the\r\nplanets around their true proportions out to the boundary traced by\r\nNeptune, this area, vast though it is, would be a mere speck on the\r\ndrawing of the object. Our system would have to be enormously bigger\r\nbefore it sufficed to cover anything like the area of the sky included\r\nin one of these great objects. Here is a sketch of a nebula, Fig. 10,\r\nand near I have marked a dot, which is to indicate our solar system.\r\nWe may feel confident that the Great Nebula is at the very least as\r\nmighty as this proportion would indicate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. THE SOLAR SYSTEM AS COMPARED WITH A GREAT\r\nNEBULA.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAIN AND SNOW\r\n\r\n(FROM THE FORMS OF WATER.)\r\n\r\nBY JOHN TYNDALL.\r\n\r\n\r\nOceanic Distillation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW CRYSTALS.]\r\n\r\nAt the equator, and within certain limits north and south of it, the\r\nsun at certain periods of the year is directly overhead at noon. These\r\nlimits are called the Tropics of Cancer and of Capricorn. Upon the\r\nbelt comprised between these two circles the sun's rays fall with\r\ntheir mightiest power; for here they shoot directly downwards, and\r\nheat both earth and sea more than when they strike slantingly.\r\n\r\nWhen the vertical sunbeams strike the land they heat it, and the air\r\nin contact with the hot soil becomes heated in turn. But when heated\r\nthe air expands, and when it expands it becomes lighter. This lighter\r\nair rises, like wood plunged into water, through the heavier air\r\noverhead.\r\n\r\nWhen the sunbeams fall upon the sea the water is warmed, though not so\r\nmuch as the land. The warmed water expands, becomes thereby lighter,\r\nand therefore continues to float upon the top. This upper layer of\r\nwater warms to some extent the air in contact with it, but it also\r\nsends up a quantity of aqueous vapor, which being far lighter than\r\nair, helps the latter to rise. Thus both from the land and from the\r\nsea we have ascending currents established by the action of the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen they reach a certain elevation in the atmosphere, these currents\r\ndivide and flow, part towards the north and part towards the south;\r\nwhile from the north and the south a flow of heavier and colder air\r\nsets in to supply the place of the ascending warm air.\r\n\r\nIncessant circulation is thus established in the atmosphere. The\r\nequatorial air and vapor flow above towards the north and south poles,\r\nwhile the polar air flows below towards the equator. The two currents\r\nof air thus established are called the upper and the lower trade\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nBut before the air returns from the poles great changes have occurred.\r\nFor the air as it quitted the equatorial regions was laden with\r\naqueous vapor, which could not subsist in the cold polar regions. It\r\nis there precipitated, falling sometimes as rain, or more commonly as\r\nsnow. The land near the pole is covered with this snow, which gives\r\nbirth to vast glaciers.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that you should have a perfectly clear view of this\r\nprocess, for great mistakes have been made regarding the manner in\r\nwhich glaciers are related to the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nIt was supposed that if the sun's heat were diminished, greater\r\nglaciers than those now existing would be produced. But the lessening\r\nof the sun's heat would infallibly diminish the quantity of aqueous\r\nvapor, and thus cut off the glaciers at their source. A brief\r\nillustration will complete your knowledge here.\r\n\r\nIn the process of ordinary distillation, the liquid to be distilled is\r\nheated and converted into vapor in one vessel, and chilled and\r\nreconverted into liquid in another. What has just been stated renders\r\nit plain that the earth and its atmosphere constitute a vast\r\ndistilling apparatus in which the equatorial ocean plays the part of\r\nthe boiler, and the chill regions of the poles the part of the\r\ncondenser. In this process of distillation _heat_ plays quite as\r\nnecessary a part as _cold_, and before Bishop Heber could speak of\r\n\"Greenland's icy mountains,\" the equatorial ocean had to be warmed by\r\nthe sun. We shall have more to say upon this question afterwards.\r\n\r\nThe heating of the tropical air by the sun is _indirect_. The solar\r\nbeams have scarcely any power to heat the air through which they pass;\r\nbut they heat the land and ocean, and these communicate their heat to\r\nthe air in contact with them. The air and vapor start upwards charged\r\nwith the heat thus communicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTropical Rains.\r\n\r\nBut long before the air and vapor from the equator reach the poles,\r\nprecipitation occurs. Wherever a humid warm wind mixes with a cold dry\r\none, rain falls. Indeed the heaviest rains occur at those places where\r\nthe sun is vertically overhead. We must enquire a little more closely\r\ninto their origin.\r\n\r\nFill a bladder about two-thirds full of air at the sea level, and take\r\nit to the summit of Mount Blanc. As you ascend, the bladder becomes\r\nmore and more distended; at the top of the mountain it is fully\r\ndistended, and has evidently to bear a pressure from within. Returning\r\nto the sea level you find that the tightness disappears, the bladder\r\nfinally appearing as flaccid as at first.\r\n\r\nThe reason is plain. At the sea level the air within the bladder has\r\nto bear the pressure of the whole atmosphere, being thereby squeezed\r\ninto a comparatively small volume. In ascending the mountain, you\r\nleave more and more of the atmosphere behind; the pressure becomes\r\nless and less, and by its expansive force the air within the bladder\r\nswells as the outside pressure is diminished. At the top of the\r\nmountain the expansion is quite sufficient to render the bladder\r\ntight, the pressure within being then actually greater than the\r\npressure without. By means of an air-pump we can show the expansion of\r\na balloon partly filled with air, when the external pressure has been\r\nin part removed.\r\n\r\nBut why do I dwell upon this? Simply to make plain to you that the\r\n_unconfined air_, heated at the earth's surface, and ascending by its\r\nlightness, must expand more and more the higher it rises in the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have to introduce to you a new fact, towards the statement\r\nof which I have been working for some time. It is this: _The ascending\r\nair is chilled by its expansion_. Indeed this chilling is one source\r\nof the coldness of the higher atmospheric regions. And now fix your\r\neye upon those mixed currents of air and aqueous vapor which rise from\r\nthe warm tropical ocean. They start with plenty of heat to preserve\r\nthe vapor as vapor; but as they rise they come into regions already\r\nchilled, and they are still further chilled by their own expansion.\r\nThe consequence might be foreseen. The load of vapor is in great part\r\nprecipitated, dense clouds are formed, their particles coalesce to\r\nrain-drops, which descend daily in gushes so profuse that the word\r\n\"torrential\" is used to express the copiousness of the rainfall. I\r\ncould show you this chilling by expansion, and also the consequent\r\nprecipitation of clouds.\r\n\r\nThus long before the air from the equator reaches the poles its vapor\r\nis in great part removed from it, having redescended to the earth as\r\nrain. Still a good quantity of the vapor is carried forward, which\r\nyields hail, rain, and snow in northern and southern lands.\r\n\r\n\r\nMountain Condensers.\r\n\r\nTo complete our view of the process of atmospheric precipitation we\r\nmust take into account the action of mountains. Imagine a south-west\r\nwind blowing across the Atlantic towards Ireland. In its passage it\r\ncharges itself with aqueous vapor. In the south of Ireland it\r\nencounters the mountains of Kerry: the highest of these is\r\nMagillicuddy's Reeks, near Killarney. Now the lowest stratum of this\r\nAtlantic wind is that which is most fully charged with vapor. When it\r\nencounters the base of the Kerry Mountains it is tilted up and flows\r\nbodily over them. Its load of vapor is therefore carried to a height,\r\nit expands on reaching the height, it is chilled in consequence of\r\nthe expansion, and comes down in copious showers of rain. From this,\r\nin fact, arises the luxuriant vegetation of Killarney; to this,\r\nindeed, the lakes owe their water supply. The cold crests of the\r\nmountains also aid in the work of condensation.\r\n\r\nNote the consequence. There is a town called Cahirciveen to the\r\nsouth-west of Magillicuddy's Reeks, at which observations of the\r\nrainfall have been made, and a good distance farther to the\r\nnorth-east, right in the course of the south-west wind there is\r\nanother town, called Portarlington, at which observations of rainfall\r\nhave also been made. But before the wind reaches the latter station it\r\nhas passed over the mountains of Kerry and left a great portion of its\r\nmoisture behind it. What is the result? At Cahirciveen, as shown by\r\nDr. Lloyd, the rainfall amounts to fifty-nine inches in a year, while\r\nat Portarlington it is only twenty-one inches.\r\n\r\nAgain, you may sometimes descend from the Alps when the fall of rain\r\nand snow is heavy and incessant, into Italy, and find the sky over the\r\nplains of Lombardy blue and cloudless, the wind at the same time\r\n_blowing over the plain towards the Alps_. Below the wind is hot\r\nenough to keep its vapor in a perfectly transparent state; but it\r\nmeets the mountains, is tilted up, expanded, and chilled. The cold of\r\nthe higher summits also helps the chill. The consequence is that the\r\nvapor is precipitated as rain or snow, thus producing bad weather upon\r\nthe heights, while the plains below, flooded with the same air, enjoy\r\nthe aspect of the unclouded summer sun. Clouds blowing _from_ the\r\nAlps are also sometimes dissolved over the plains of Lombardy.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the formation of clouds by mountains, one\r\nparticularly instructive effect may be here noticed. You frequently\r\nsee a streamer of cloud many hundred yards in length drawn out from an\r\nAlpine peak. Its steadiness appears perfect, though a strong wind may\r\nbe blowing at the same time over the mountain head. Why is the cloud\r\nnot blown away? It _is_ blown away; its permanence is only apparent.\r\nAt one end it is incessantly dissolved; at the other end it is\r\nincessantly renewed: supply and consumption being thus equalized, the\r\ncloud appears as changeless as the mountain to which it seems to\r\ncling. When the red sun of the evening shines upon these\r\ncloud-streamers they resemble vast torches with their flames blown\r\nthrough the air.\r\n\r\nArchitecture of Snow.\r\n\r\nWe now resemble persons who have climbed a difficult peak, and thereby\r\nearned the enjoyment of a wide prospect. Having made ourselves masters\r\nof the conditions necessary to the production of mountain snow, we are\r\nable to take a comprehensive and intelligent view of the phenomena of\r\nglaciers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW CRYSTALS.]\r\n\r\nA few words are still necessary as to the formation of snow. The\r\nmolecules and atoms of all substances, when allowed free play, build\r\nthemselves into definite and, for the most part, beautiful forms\r\ncalled crystals. Iron, copper, gold, silver, lead, sulphur, when\r\nmelted and permitted to cool gradually, all show this crystallizing\r\npower. The metal bismuth shows it in a particularly striking manner,\r\nand when properly fused and solidified, self-built crystals of great\r\nsize and beauty are formed of this metal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW-STAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW-STAR.]\r\n\r\nIf you dissolve salt-petre in water, and allow the solution to\r\nevaporate slowly, you may obtain large crystals, for no portion of the\r\nsalt is converted into vapor. The water of our atmosphere is fresh\r\nthough it is derived from the salt sea. Sugar dissolved in water, and\r\npermitted to evaporate, yields crystals of sugar-candy. Alum readily\r\ncrystallizes in the same way. Flints dissolved, as they sometimes are\r\nin nature, and permitted to crystallize, yield the prisms and pyramids\r\nof rock crystal. Chalk dissolved and crystallized yields Iceland spar.\r\nThe diamond is crystallized carbon. All our precious stones, the\r\nruby, sapphire, beryl, topaz, emerald, are all examples of this\r\ncrystallizing power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW-STAR.]\r\n\r\nYou have heard of the force of gravitation, and you know that it\r\nconsists of an attraction of every particle of matter for every other\r\nparticle. You know that planets and moons are held in their orbits by\r\nthis attraction. But gravitation is a very simple affair compared to\r\nthe force, or rather forces, of crystallization. For here the ultimate\r\nparticles of matter, inconceivably small as they are, show themselves\r\npossessed of attractive and repellent poles, by the mutual action of\r\nwhich the shape and structure of the crystal are determined. In the\r\nsolid condition the attracting poles are rigidly locked together; but\r\nif sufficient heat be applied the bond of union is dissolved, and in\r\nthe state of fusion the poles are pushed so far asunder as to be\r\npractically out of each other's range. The natural tendency of the\r\nmolecules to build themselves together is thus neutralized.\r\n\r\nThis is the case with water, which as a liquid is to all appearance\r\nformless. When sufficiently cooled the molecules are brought within\r\nthe play of the crystallizing force, and they then arrange themselves\r\nin forms of indescribable beauty. When snow is produced in calm air,\r\nthe icy particles build themselves into beautiful stellar shapes, each\r\nstar possessing six rays. There is no deviation from this type, though\r\nin other respects the appearances of the snow-stars are infinitely\r\nvarious. In the polar regions these exquisite forms were observed by\r\nDr. Scoresby, who gave numerous drawings of them. I have observed them\r\nin mid-winter filling the air, and loading the slopes of the Alps. But\r\nin England they are also to be seen, and no words of mine could convey\r\nso vivid an impression of their beauty as the annexed drawings of a\r\nfew of them, executed at Greenwich by Mr. Glaisher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW-STAR.]\r\n\r\nIt is worth pausing to think what wonderful work is going on in the\r\natmosphere during the formation and descent of every snow-shower; what\r\nbuilding power is brought into play! and how imperfect seem the\r\nproductions of human minds and hands when compared with those formed\r\nby the blind forces of nature!\r\n\r\nBut who ventures to call the forces of nature blind? In reality, when\r\nwe speak thus we are describing our own condition. The blindness is\r\nours; and what we really ought to say, and to confess, is that our\r\npowers are absolutely unable to comprehend either the origin or the\r\nend of the operations of nature.\r\n\r\nBut while we thus acknowledge our limits, there is also reason for\r\nwonder at the extent to which science has mastered the system of\r\nnature. From age to age, and from generation to generation, fact has\r\nbeen added to fact, and law to law, the true method and order of the\r\nUniverse being thereby more and more revealed. In doing this science\r\nhas encountered and overthrown various forms of superstition and\r\ndeceit, of credulity and imposture. But the world continually produces\r\nweak persons and wicked persons; and as long as they continue to exist\r\nside by side, as they do in this our day, very debasing beliefs will\r\nalso continue to infest the world.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtomic Poles.\r\n\r\n\"What did I mean when, a few moments ago I spoke of attracting and\r\nrepellent poles?\" Let me try to answer this question. You know that\r\nastronomers and geographers speak of the earth's poles, and you have\r\nalso heard of magnetic poles, the poles of a magnet being the points\r\nat which the attraction and repulsion of the magnet are as it were\r\nconcentrated.\r\n\r\nEvery magnet possesses two such poles; and if iron filings be\r\nscattered over a magnet, each particle becomes also endowed with two\r\npoles. Suppose such particles devoid of weight and floating in our\r\natmosphere, what must occur when they come near each other? Manifestly\r\nthe repellent poles will retreat from each other, while the attractive\r\npoles will approach and finally lock themselves together. And\r\nsupposing the particles, instead of a single pair, to possess several\r\npairs of poles arranged at definite points over their surfaces; you\r\ncan then picture them, in obedience to their mutual attractions and\r\nrepulsions, building themselves together to form masses of definite\r\nshape and structure.\r\n\r\nImagine the molecules of water in calm cold air to be gifted with\r\npoles of this description, which compel the particles to lay\r\nthemselves together in a definite order, and you have before your\r\nmind's eye the unseen architecture which finally produces the visible\r\nand beautiful crystals of the snow. Thus our first notions and\r\nconceptions of poles are obtained from the sight of our eyes in\r\nlooking at the effects of magnetism; and we then transfer these\r\nnotions and conceptions to particles which no eye has ever seen. The\r\npower by which we thus picture to ourselves effects beyond the range\r\nof the senses is what philosophers call the Imagination, and in the\r\neffort of the mind to seize upon the unseen architecture of crystals,\r\nwe have an example of the \"scientific use\" of this faculty. Without\r\nimagination we might have _critical_ power, but not _creative_ power\r\nin science.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchitecture of Lake Ice.\r\n\r\nWe have thus made ourselves acquainted with the beautiful snow-flowers\r\nself-constructed by the molecules of water in calm, cold air. Do the\r\nmolecules show this architectural power when ordinary water is frozen?\r\nWhat, for example, is the structure of the ice over which we skate in\r\nwinter? Quite as wonderful as the flowers of the snow. The observation\r\nis rare, if not new, but I have seen in water slowly freezing\r\nsix-rayed ice-stars formed, and floating free on the surface. A\r\nsix-rayed star, moreover, is typical of the construction of all our\r\nlake ice. It is built up of such forms wonderfully interlaced.\r\n\r\nTake a slab of lake ice and place it in the path of a concentrated\r\nsunbeam. Watch the track of the beam through the ice. Part of the beam\r\nis stopped, part of it goes through; the former produces internal\r\nliquefaction, the latter has no effect whatever upon the ice. But the\r\nliquefaction is not uniformly diffused. From separate spots of the ice\r\nlittle shining points are seen to sparkle forth. Every one of those\r\npoints is surrounded by a beautiful liquid flower with six petals.\r\n\r\nIce and water are so optically alike that unless the light fall\r\nproperly upon these flowers you cannot see them. But what is the\r\ncentral spot? A vacuum. Ice swims on water because, bulk for bulk, it\r\nis lighter than water; so that when ice is melted it shrinks in size.\r\nCan the liquid flowers then occupy the whole space of the ice melted?\r\nPlainly no. A little empty space is formed with the flowers, and this\r\nspace, or rather its surface, shines in the sun with the lustre of\r\nburnished silver.\r\n\r\nIn all cases the flowers are formed parallel to the surface of\r\nfreezing. They are formed when the sun shines upon the ice of every\r\nlake; sometimes in myriads, and so small as to require a magnifying\r\nglass to see them. They are always attainable, but their beauty is\r\noften marred by internal defects of the ice. Every one portion of the\r\nsame piece of ice may show them exquisitely, while a second portion\r\nshows them imperfectly.\r\n\r\nAnnexed is a very imperfect sketch of these beautiful figures.\r\n\r\nHere we have a reversal of the process of crystallization. The\r\nsearching solar beam is delicate enough to take the molecules down\r\nwithout deranging the order of their architecture. Try the experiment\r\nfor yourself with a pocket-lens on a sunny day. You will not find the\r\nflowers confused; they all lie parallel to the surface of freezing. In\r\nthis exquisite way every bit of the ice over which our skaters glide\r\nin winter is put together.\r\n\r\nI said that a portion of the sunbeam was stopped by the ice and\r\nliquefied it. What is this portion? The dark heat of the sun. The\r\ngreat body of the light waves and even a portion of the dark ones,\r\npass through the ice without losing any of their heating power. When\r\nproperly concentrated on combustible bodies, even after having passed\r\nthrough the ice, their burning power becomes manifest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIQUID FLOWERS IN LAKE ICE.]\r\n\r\nAnd the ice itself may be employed to concentrate them. With an\r\nice-lens in the polar regions Dr. Scoresby has often concentrated the\r\nsun's rays so as to make them burn wood, fire gunpowder, and melt\r\nlead; thus proving that the heating power is retained by the rays,\r\neven after they have passed through so cold a substance.\r\n\r\nBy rendering the rays of the electric lamp parallel, and then sending\r\nthem through a lens of ice, we obtain all the effects which Dr.\r\nScoresby obtained with the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORGANIC WORLD\r\n\r\n(FROM THE ELEMENTS OF SCIENCE.)\r\n\r\nBY ST. GEORGE MIVART F.R.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of all the various kinds of living creatures is so enormous\r\nthat it would be impossible to study them profitably, were they not\r\nclassified in an orderly manner. Therefore the whole mass has been\r\ndivided, in the first place, into two supreme groups, fancifully\r\ntermed kingdoms--the \"animal kingdom\" and the \"vegetal kingdom.\" Each\r\nof these is subdivided into an orderly series of subordinate groups,\r\nsuccessively contained one within the other, and named sub-kingdoms,\r\nclasses, orders, families, genera and species. The lowest group but\r\none is the \"genus,\" which contains one or more different kinds termed\r\n\"species,\" as e.g., the species \"wood anemone\" and the species \"blue\r\ntitmouse.\" The lowest group of all--a species--may be said to consist\r\nof individuals which differ from each other only by trifling\r\ncharacters, such as characters due to difference of sex, while their\r\npeculiar organization is faithfully reproduced by generation as a\r\nwhole, though small individual differences exist in all cases.\r\n\r\nThe vegetal, or vegetable, kingdom, consists of the great mass of\r\nflowering plants, many of which, however, have such inconspicuous\r\nflowers that they are mistakenly regarded as flowerless, as is often\r\nthe case with the grasses, the pines, and the yews. Another mass, or\r\nsub-kingdom, of plants consists of the really flowerless plants, such\r\nas the ferns, horsetails (Fig. 1), lycopods, and mosses. Sea and\r\nfresh-water weeds (_algæ_), and mushrooms, or \"moulds,\" of all kinds\r\n(_fungi_), amongst which are the now famous \"bacteria,\" constitute a\r\nthird and lowest set of plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. HORSE-TAIL (_Equisetum drummondii_).]\r\n\r\nThe animal kingdom consists, first, of a sub-kingdom of animals which\r\npossess a spinal column, or backbone, and which are known as\r\nvertebrate animals. Such are all beasts, birds, reptiles, and fishes.\r\nThere are also a variety of remotely allied marine organisms known as\r\ntunicates, sea-squirts, or ascidians (Fig. 2). There is, further, an\r\nimmense group of arthropods, consisting of all insects, crab-like\r\ncreatures, hundred-legs and their allies, with spiders, scorpions,\r\ntics and mites. We have also the sub-kingdom of shell-fish or\r\nmolluscs, including cuttle-fishes, snails, whelks, limpets, the\r\noyster, and a multitude of allied forms. A multitudinous sub-kingdom of\r\nworms also exists, as well as another of star-fishes and their\r\ncongeners. There is yet another of zoophytes, or polyps, and another\r\nof sponges, and, finally, we have a sub-kingdom of minute creatures,\r\nor animalculæ, of very varied forms, which may make up the sub-kingdom\r\nof _Protozoa_, consisting of animals which are mostly unicellular.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. A TUNICATE (_Ascidia_).]\r\n\r\nMultitudinous and varied as are the creatures which compose this\r\nimmense organic world, they nevertheless exhibit a very remarkable\r\nuniformity of composition in their essential structure. Every living\r\ncreature from a man to a mushroom, or even to the smallest animalcule\r\nor unicellular plant is always partly fluid, but never entirely so.\r\nEvery living creature also consists in part (and that part is the most\r\nactive living part) of a soft, viscid, transparent, colorless\r\nsubstance, termed protoplasm, which can be resolved into the four\r\nelements, oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon. Besides these four\r\nelements, living organisms commonly contain sulphur, phosphorus,\r\nchlorine, potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium and iron.\r\n\r\nIn the fact that living creatures always consist of the four elements,\r\noxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen and carbon, we have a fundamental character\r\nwhereby the organic and inorganic (or non-living) worlds are to be\r\ndistinguished, for as we have seen, inorganic bodies, instead of being\r\nthus uniformly constituted, may consist of the most diverse elements\r\nand sometimes of but two or even of only one.\r\n\r\nAgain, many minerals, such as crystals, are bounded by plain surfaces,\r\nand, with very few exceptions (spathic and hematite iron and dolomite\r\nare such exceptions) none are bounded by curved lines and surfaces,\r\nwhile living organisms are bounded by such lines and surfaces.\r\n\r\nYet, again, if a crystal be cut through, its internal structure will\r\nbe seen to be similar throughout. But if the body of any living\r\ncreature be divided, it will, at the very least, be seen to consist of\r\na variety of minute distinct particles, called \"granules,\" variously\r\ndistributed throughout its interior.\r\n\r\nAll organisms consist either--as do the simplest, mostly microscopic,\r\nplants and animals--of a single minute mass of protoplasm, or of a\r\nfew, or of many, or of an enormous aggregation of such before-mentioned\r\nparticles, each of which is one of those bodies named a \"cell\" (Fig.\r\n3). Cells may, or may not, be enclosed in an investing coat or\r\n\"cell-wall.\" Every cell generally contains within it a denser,\r\nnormally spheroidal, body known as the nucleus.\r\n\r\nNow protoplasm is a very unstable substance--as we have seen many\r\nsubstances are whereof nitrogen is a component part--and it possesses\r\nactive properties which are not present in the non-living, or\r\ninorganic world. In the latter, differences of temperature will\r\nproduce motion in the shape of \"currents,\" as we have seen with\r\nrespect to masses of air and water. But in a portion of protoplasm,\r\nan internal circulation of currents in definite lines will establish\r\nitself from other causes.\r\n\r\nInorganic bodies, as we have seen, will expand with heat, as they may\r\nalso do from imbibing moisture; but living protoplasm has an\r\napparently spontaneous power of contraction and expansion under\r\ncertain external conditions which do not occasion such movements in\r\ninorganic matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. CELL FROM A SALAMANDER. _n_, nucleus; _n'_,\r\nnucleolus embedded in the network of chromatin threads; _k_, network\r\nof the cell external to the nucleus; _a_, attraction-sphere or\r\narchoplasm containing minute bodies called centrosomes; _cl_, membrane\r\nenclosing the cell externally, _nl_, membrane surrounding the nucleus;\r\n_c_, centrosomes.]\r\n\r\nUnder favoring conditions, protoplasm has a power of performing\r\nchemical changes, which result in producing heat far more gently and\r\ncontinuously than it is produced by the combustion of inorganic\r\nbodies. Thus it is that the heat is produced which makes its presence\r\nevident to us in what we call \"warm-blooded animals,\" the most\r\nwarm-blooded of all being birds.\r\n\r\nProtoplasm has also the wonderful power of transforming certain\r\nadjacent substances into material like itself--into its own\r\nsubstance--and so, in a sense, creating a new material. Thus it is\r\nthat organisms have the power to nourish themselves and grow. An\r\nanimal would vainly swallow the most nourishing food if the ultimate,\r\nprotoplasmic particles of its body had not this power of\r\n\"transforming\" suitable substances brought near them in ways to be\r\nhereinafter noticed.\r\n\r\nWithout that, no organism could ever \"grow.\" The growth of organisms\r\nis utterly different from the increase in size of inorganic bodies.\r\nCrystals, as we have seen, grow merely by external increment; but\r\norganisms grow by an increment which takes place in the very innermost\r\nsubstance of the tissues which compose their bodies, and the innermost\r\nsubstance of the cells which compose such tissues; this peculiar form\r\nof growth is termed _intussusception_.\r\n\r\nProtoplasm, after thus augmenting its mass, has a further power of\r\nspontaneous division, whereby the mass of the entire organism whereof\r\nsuch protoplasm forms a part, is augmented and so growth is brought\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nThe small particles of protoplasm which constitute \"cells\" are far\r\nindeed from being structureless. Besides the nucleus already mentioned\r\nthere is a delicate network of threads of a substance called\r\n_chromatin_ within it, and another network permeating the fluid of the\r\ncell substance, which invest the nucleus often with further\r\ncomplications. These networks generally perform (or undergo) a most\r\ncomplex series of changes every time a cell spontaneously divides. In\r\ncertain cases, however, it appears that the nucleus divides into two\r\nin a more simple fashion, the rest of the cell contents subsequently\r\ndividing--each half enclosing one part of the previously divided\r\nnucleus. It is by a continued process of cell division that the\r\ncomplex structures of the most complex organisms is brought about.\r\n\r\nThe division of a cell, or particle of protoplasm, is indeed a\r\nnecessary consequence of its complete nutrition.\r\n\r\nFor new material can only be absorbed by its surface. But as the cell\r\ngrows, the proportion borne by its surface to its mass, continually\r\ndecreases; therefore this surface must soon be too small to take in\r\nnourishment enough, and the particle, or cell, must therefore either\r\ndie or divide. By dividing, its parts can continue the nutritive\r\nprocess till their surface, in turn, becomes insufficient, when they\r\nmust divide again, and so on. Thus the term \"feeding\" has two senses.\r\n\"To feed a horse,\" ordinarily means to give it a certain quantity of\r\nhay, oats or what not; and such indeed is one kind of feeding. But\r\nobviously, if the nourishment so taken could not get from the stomach\r\nand intestines into the ultimate particles and cells of the horse's\r\nbody, the horse could not be nourished, and still less could it grow.\r\nIt is this latter process, called assimilation, which is the real and\r\nessential process of feeding, to which the process ordinarily so\r\ncalled is but introductory.\r\n\r\nProtoplasm has also the power of forming and ejecting from its own\r\nsubstance, other substances which it has made, but which are of a\r\ndifferent nature to its own. This function, as before said, is termed\r\nsecretion; and we know the liver secretes bile, and that the cow's\r\nudder secretes milk.\r\n\r\nHere again we have an external and an internal process. The milk is\r\ndrawn forth from a receptacle, the udder, into which it finds its way,\r\nand so, in a superficial sense, it may be called an organ of\r\nsecretion. Nevertheless the true internal secretion takes place in\r\nthe innermost substance of the cells or particles of protoplasm, of\r\nthe milk-land, which particles really form that liquid.\r\n\r\nBut every living creature consists at first entirely of a particle of\r\nprotoplasm. Therefore every other kind of substance which may be found\r\nin every kind of plant or animal, must have been formed through it,\r\nand be, in fact, a secretion from protoplasm. Such is the rosy cheek\r\nof an apple, or of a maiden, the luscious juice of the peach, the\r\nproduce of the castor-oil plant, the baleen that lines the whale's\r\nenormous jaws, as well as that softest product, the fur of the\r\nchinchilla. Indeed, every particle of protoplasm requires, in order\r\nthat it may live, a continuous process of exchange. It needs to be\r\ncontinuously first built up by food, and then broken down by\r\ndischarging what is no longer needful for its healthy existence. Thus\r\nthe life of every organism is a life of almost incessant change, not\r\nonly in its being as a whole, but in that of all its protoplasmic\r\nparticles also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. AMOEBA SHOWN IN TWO OF THE MANY IRREGULAR\r\nSHAPES IT ASSUMES. _(After Howes_.)\r\n\r\nThe clear space within it is a contractile vesicle. The dark body is\r\nthe nucleus. In the right-hand figure there is shown a particle of\r\nfood, passing through the external surface.]\r\n\r\n\r\nProminent among such processes is that of an interchange of gases\r\nbetween the living being and its environment. This process consists in\r\nan absorption of oxygen and a giving-out of carbonic acid, which\r\nexchange is termed respiration.\r\n\r\nLastly, protoplasm has a power of motion when appropriately acted on.\r\nIt will then contract or expand its shape by alternate protrusions and\r\nretractions of parts of its substance. These movements are termed\r\namoebiform, because they quite resemble the movements of a small\r\nanimalcule which is named amoeba. (See Fig. 4.)\r\n\r\nSuch is the ultimate structure, and such are the fundamental\r\nactivities or functions of living organisms, as far as they can here\r\nbe described, from the lowest animalcule and unicellular plant, up to\r\nthe most complex organisms and the body of man himself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINHABITANTS OF MY POOL\r\n\r\n(FROM MAGIC GLASSES.)\r\n\r\nBY ARABELLA B. BUCKLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pool lies in a deep hollow among a group of rocks and boulders,\r\nclose to the entrance of the cove, which can only be entered at low\r\nwater; it does not measure more than two feet across, so that you can\r\nstep over it, if you take care not to slip on the masses of green and\r\nbrown seaweed growing over the rocks on its sides, as I have done many\r\na time when collecting specimens for our salt-water aquarium. I find\r\nnow the only way is to lie flat down on the rock, so that my hands and\r\neyes are free to observe and handle, and then, bringing my eye down to\r\nthe edge of the pool, to lift the seaweeds and let the sunlight enter\r\ninto the chinks and crannies. In this way I can catch sight of many a\r\nsmall being either on the seaweed or the rocky ledges, and even\r\ncreatures transparent as glass become visible by the thin outline\r\ngleaming in the sunlight. Then I pluck a piece of seaweed, or chip off\r\na fragment of rock with a sharp-edged collecting knife, bringing away\r\nthe specimen uninjured upon it, and place it carefully in its own\r\nseparate bottle to be carried home alive and well.\r\n\r\nNow though this little pool and I are old friends, I find new\r\ntreasures in it almost every time I go, for it is almost as full of\r\nliving things as the heavens are of stars, and the tide as it comes\r\nand goes brings many a mother there to find a safe home for her little\r\nones, and many a waif and stray to seek shelter from the troublous\r\nlife of the open ocean.\r\n\r\nYou will perhaps find it difficult to believe that in this rock-bound\r\nbasin there can be millions of living creatures hidden away among the\r\nfine feathery weeds; yet so it is. Not that they are always the same.\r\nAt one time it may be the home of myriads of infant crabs, not an\r\neighth of an inch long, another of baby sea-urchins only visible to\r\nthe naked eye as minute spots in the water, at another of young\r\njelly-fish growing on their tiny stalks, and splitting off one by one\r\nas transparent bells to float away with the rising tide. Or it may be\r\nthat the whelk has chosen this quiet nook to deposit her leathery\r\neggs; or young barnacles, periwinkles, and limpets are growing up\r\namong the green and brown tangles, while the far-sailing velella and\r\nthe stay-at-home sea-squirts, together with a variety of other\r\nsea-animals, find a nursery and shelter in their youth in this quiet\r\nharbor of rest.\r\n\r\nAnd besides these casual visitors there are numberless creatures which\r\nhave lived and multiplied there, ever since I first visited the pool.\r\nTender red, olive-colored, and green seaweeds, stony corallines, and\r\nacorn-barnacles lining the floor, sea-anemones clinging to the sides,\r\nsponges tiny and many-colored hiding under the ledges, and limpets and\r\nmussels wedged in the cracks. These can be easily seen with the naked\r\neye, but they are not the most numerous inhabitants; for these we\r\nmust search with a magnifying glass, which will reveal to us wonderful\r\nfairy-forms, delicate crystal vases with tiny creatures in them whose\r\ntransparent lashes make whirlpools in the water, living crystal bells\r\nso tiny that whole branches of them look only like a fringe of hair,\r\njelly globes rising and falling in the water, patches of living jelly\r\nclinging to the rocky sides of the pool, and a hundred other forms,\r\nsome so minute that you must examine the fine sand in which they lie\r\nunder a powerful microscope before you can even guess that they are\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. GROUP OF SEAWEEDS.\r\n\r\n(Natural size.)\r\n\r\n1, _Ulva Linza._ 2, _Sphacelaria filicina._ 3, _Polysiphonia\r\nurceolata._ 4, _Corallina officinalis._]\r\n\r\nSo it has proved a rich hunting-ground, where summer and winter,\r\nspring and autumn, I find some form to put under my magic glass. There\r\nI can watch it for weeks growing and multiplying under my care; moved\r\nonly from the aquarium, where I keep it supplied with healthy\r\nsea-water, to the tiny transparent trough in which I place it for a\r\nfew hours to see the changes it has undergone. I could tell you\r\nendless tales of transformations in these tiny lives, but I want\r\nto-day to show you a few of my friends, most of which I brought\r\nyesterday fresh from the pool, and have prepared for you to examine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2. _Ulva lactuca_, A GREEN-SEAWEED, GREATLY\r\nMAGNIFIED TO SHOW STRUCTURE. (_After Orested)._\r\n\r\ns, Spores in the cells, _ss_, Spores swimming out. _h_, Holes through\r\nwhich spores have escaped.]\r\n\r\nLet us begin with seaweeds. I have said that there are three leading\r\ncolors in my pool--green, olive, and red--and these tints mark roughly\r\nthree kinds of weed, though they occur in an endless variety of\r\nshapes. Here is a piece of the beautiful pale green seaweed, called\r\nthe Laver or Sea-Lettuce, _Ulva Linza_ (1, Fig. 1),[1] which grows in\r\nlong ribbons in a sunny nook in the water. I have placed under the\r\nfirst microscope a piece of this weed which is just sending out young\r\nseaweeds in the shape of tiny cells, with lashes very like those we\r\nsaw coming from the moss-flower, and I have pressed them in the\r\nposition in which they would naturally leave the plant. You will also\r\nsee on this side several cells in which these tiny spores are forming,\r\nready to burst out and swim; for this green weed is merely a\r\ncollection of cells, like the single-celled plants on land. Each cell\r\ncan work as a separate plant; it feeds, grows, and can send out its\r\nown young spores.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The slice given in Fig. 2 is from a broader-leaved form,\r\n_U. lactuca_, because this species, being composed of only one layer\r\nof cells, is better seen. _Ulva Linza_ is composed of two layers of\r\ncells.]\r\n\r\nThis deep olive-green feathery weed (2, Fig. 1), of which a piece is\r\nmagnified under the next microscope (2, Fig. 3), is very different. It\r\nis a higher plant, and works harder for its living, using the darker\r\nrays of sunlight which penetrate into shady parts of the pool. So it\r\ncomes to pass that its cells divide the work. Those of the feathery\r\nthreads make the food, while others, growing on short stalks on the\r\nshafts of the feather, make and send out the young spores.\r\n\r\nLastly, the lovely red threadlike weeds, such as this _Polysiphonia\r\nurceolata_ (3, Fig. 1), carry actual urns on their stems like those of\r\nmosses. In fact, the history of these urns (see 3, Fig. 3), is much\r\nthe same in the two classes of plants, only that instead of the urn\r\nbeing pushed up on a thin stalk as in the moss, it remains on the\r\nseaweed close down to the stem, when it grows out of the plant-egg,\r\nand the tiny plant is shut in till the spores are ready to swim out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. THREE SEAWEEDS OF FIG. 1 MUCH MAGNIFIED TO SHOW\r\nFRUITS. (_Harvey._)\r\n\r\n2, _Sphacelaria filicina._ 3, _Polysiphonia urceolata._ 4, _Corallina\r\nofficinalis._]\r\n\r\nThe stony corallines (4, Figs. 1 and 3), which build so much carbonate\r\nof lime into their stems, are near relations of the red seaweeds.\r\nThere are plenty of them in my pool. Some of them, of a deep purple\r\ncolor, grow upright in stiff groups about three or four inches high;\r\nand others, which form crusts over the stones and weeds, are a pale\r\nrose color; but both kinds, when the plant dies, leaving the stony\r\nskeleton (1, Fig. 4), are a pure white, and used to be mistaken for\r\ncorals. They belong to the same order of plants as the red weeds,\r\nwhich all live in shady nooks in the pools, and are the highest of\r\ntheir race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. CORALLINE AND SERTULARIA, TO SHOW LIKENESS\r\nBETWEEN THE ANIMAL SERTULARIA AND THE PLANT CORALLINE.\r\n\r\n1, _Corallina officinalis._ 2, _Sertularia filicula._]\r\n\r\nMy pool is full of different forms of these four weeds. The green\r\nribbons float on the surface rooted to the sides of the pool, and, as\r\nthe sun shines upon it, the glittering bubbles rising from them show\r\nthat they are working up food out of the air in the water, and giving\r\noff oxygen. The brown weeds lie chiefly under the shelves of rocks,\r\nfor they can manage with less sunlight, and use the darker rays which\r\npass by the green weeds; and last of all, the red weeds and\r\ncorallines, small and delicate in form, line the bottom of the pool in\r\nits darkest nooks.\r\n\r\nAnd now if I hand round two specimens,--one a coralline, and the other\r\nsomething you do not yet know,--I am sure you will say at first sight\r\nthat they belong to the same family, and, in fact, if you buy at the\r\nseaside a group of seaweeds gummed on paper, you will most likely get\r\nboth these among them. Yet the truth is; that while the coralline (1,\r\nFig. 4) is a plant, the other specimen (2), which is called\r\n_Sertularia filicula_, is an animal.\r\n\r\nThis special sertularian grows up right in my pool on stones or often\r\non seaweeds, but I have here (Fig. 5) another and much smaller one\r\nwhich lives literally in millions hanging its cups downwards. I find\r\nit not only under the narrow ledges of the pool sheltered by the\r\nseaweed, but forming a fringe along all the rocks on each side of the\r\ncove near to low-water mark, and for a long time I passed it by\r\nthinking it was of no interest. But I have long since given up\r\nthinking this of anything, especially in my pool, for my magic glass\r\nhas taught me that there is not even a living speck which does not\r\nopen out into something marvellous and beautiful. So I chipped off a\r\nsmall piece of rock and brought the fringe home, and found, when I\r\nhung it up in clear sea-water as I have done over this glass trough\r\n(Fig. 5) and looked at it through the lens, that each thread of the\r\ndense fringe, in itself not a quarter of an inch deep, turns out to be\r\na tiny sertularian with at least twenty mouths. You can see this with\r\nyour pocket lens even as it hangs here, and when you have examined it\r\nyou can by and by take off one thread and put it carefully in the\r\ntrough. I promise you a sight of the most beautiful little beings\r\nwhich exist in nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. _Sertularia tenella_, HANGING FROM A SPLINT OF\r\nROCK OVER A WATER TROUGH. ALSO PIECE ENLARGED TO SHOW THE ANIMAL\r\nPROTRUDING.]\r\n\r\nCome and look at it. It is a horny-branched stem with a double row of\r\ntiny cups all along each side. Out of these cups there appear a row of\r\ntiny cups all along each side (see Fig. 5), Out of these cups there\r\nappear from time to time sixteen minute transparent tentacles as fine\r\nas spun glass, which wave about in the water. If you shake the glass a\r\nlittle, in an instant each crystal star vanishes into its cup, to come\r\nout again a few minutes later; so that now here, now there, the\r\ndelicate animal-flowers spread out on each side of the stem, and the\r\ntree is covered with moving beings. These tentacles are feelers, which\r\nlash food into a mouth and stomach in each cup, where it is digested\r\nand passed, through a hole in the bottom, along a jelly thread which\r\nruns down the stem and joins all the mouths together. In this way the\r\nfood is distributed all over the tree, which is, in fact, one animal\r\nwith many feeding-cups. Some day I will show you one of these cups\r\nwith the tentacles stretched out and mounted on a slide, so that you\r\ncan examine a tentacle with a very strong magnifying power. You will\r\nthen see that it is dotted over with cells, in which are coiled fine\r\nthreads. The animal uses these threads to paralyze the creatures on\r\nwhich it feeds, for at the base of each thread there is a poison\r\ngland.\r\n\r\nIn the larger Sertularia the whole branched tree is connected by jelly\r\nthreads, running through the stem, and all the thousands of mouths are\r\nspread out in the water. One large form called _Sertularia cupressina_\r\ngrows sometimes three feet high and bears as many as a hundred\r\nthousand cups, with living mouths, on its branches.\r\n\r\nThe next of my minute friends I can only show to the class in a\r\ndiagram, but you will see it under the fourth microscope by and by. I\r\nhad great trouble in finding it yesterday, though I know its haunts\r\nupon the green weed, for it is so minute and transparent that even\r\nwhen the weed is in a trough a magnifying-glass will scarcely detect\r\nit. And I must warn you that if you want to know any of the minute\r\ncreatures we are studying, you must visit one place constantly. You\r\nmay in a casual way find many of them on seaweed, or in the damp ooze\r\nand mud, but it will be by chance only; to look for them with any\r\ncertainty you must take trouble in making their acquaintance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6. _Thuricolla folliculata_ and _Chilomonas\r\namygdalum_.

This is really all one animal, the vase _hc_\r\nbeing the horny covering or carapace of the body, which last stands up\r\nlike a tube in the centre. If you watch carefully, you may even see\r\nthe minute atoms of food twisting round inside the tube until they are\r\ndigested, after they have been swept in at the wide open mouth by the\r\nwhirling lashes. You will see this more clearly if you put a little\r\nrice-flour, very minutely powdered and colored by carmine, into the\r\nwater; for you can trace these red atoms into some round spaces called\r\n_vacuoles_ which are dotted over the body of the animal, and are\r\nreally globules of watery fluid in which the food is probably partly\r\ndigested.\r\n\r\nYou will notice, however, one round clear space _(cv)_ into which they\r\ndo not go, and after a time you will be able to observe that this\r\nround spot closes up or contracts very quickly, and then expands again\r\nvery slowly. As it expands it fills with a clear fluid, and\r\nnaturalists have not yet decided exactly what work it does. It may\r\nserve the animal either for breathing, or as a very simple heart,\r\nmaking the fluids circulate in the tube. The next interesting point\r\nabout this little being is the way it retreats into its sheltering\r\nvase. Even while you are watching, it is quite likely it may all at\r\nonce draw itself down to the bottom as in No. 2, and folding down the\r\nvalves _w_ of horny teeth which grow on each side, shut itself in from\r\nsome fancied danger. Another very curious point is that, besides\r\nsending forth young ones, these creatures multiply by dividing in two\r\n(see No. 3, Fig. 6), each one closing its own part of the vase into a\r\nnew home.\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of these Infusoria, as they are called, in my pond,\r\nsome with vases, some without, some fixed to weeds and stones, others\r\nswimming about freely. Even in the water-trough in which this\r\nThuricolla stands, I saw several smaller forms, and the next\r\nmicroscope has a trough filled with the minutest form of all, called a\r\nMonad. These are so small that two thousand of them could lie side by\r\nside in an inch; that is, if you could make them lie at all, for they\r\nare the most restless little beings, darting hither and thither,\r\nscarcely even halting except to turn back. And yet though there are so\r\nmany of them, and as far as we know they have no organs of sight, they\r\nnever run up against each other, but glide past more cleverly than any\r\nclear-sighted fish. These creatures are mostly to be found among\r\ndecaying seaweed, and though they are so tiny, you can still see\r\ndistinctly the clear space contracting and expanding within them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7. LIVING DIATOMS.\r\n\r\n_a, Cocconema lanceolatum. b, Bacillaria paradoxa. c, Gomphonema\r\nmarinum. d, Diatoma hyalina_.]\r\n\r\nBut if there are so many thousands of mouths to feed, on the tree-like\r\nSertulariæ as well as in all these Infusoria, where does the food come\r\nfrom? Partly from the numerous atoms of decaying life all around, and\r\nthe minute eggs of animals and spores of plants; but besides these,\r\nthe pool is full of minute living plants--small jelly masses with\r\nsolid coats of flint which are moulded into most lovely shapes. Plants\r\nformed of jelly and flint! You will think I am joking, but I am not.\r\nThese plants, called Diatoms, which live both in salt and fresh water,\r\nare single cells feeding and growing just like those we took from the\r\nwater-butt, only that instead of a soft covering they build up a\r\nflinty skeleton. They are so small, that many of them must be\r\nmagnified to fifty times their real size before you can even see them\r\ndistinctly. Yet the skeletons of these almost invisible plants are\r\ncarved and chiselled in the most delicate patterns. I showed you a\r\ngroup of these in our lecture on magic glasses, and now I have brought\r\na few living ones that we may learn to know them. The diagram (Fig. 7)\r\nshows the chief forms you will see on the different slides.\r\n\r\nThe first one, _Sacillaria paradoxa_ (_b_, Fig. 7), looks like a\r\nnumber of rods clinging one to another in a string, but each one of\r\nthese is a single-celled plant with a jelly cell surrounding the\r\nflinty skeleton. You will see that they move to and fro over each\r\nother in the water.\r\n\r\nThe next two forms, _a_ and _c_, look much more like plants, for the\r\ncells arrange themselves on a jelly stem, which by and by disappears,\r\nleaving only the separate flint skeletons. The last form, _d_, is\r\nsomething midway between the other forms, the separate cells hang on\r\nto each other and also on to a straight jelly stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8. A DIATOM (_Diatoma vulgare_) GROWING.\r\n\r\n_a, b,_ Flint skeleton inside the jelly-cell. _a, c_ and _d, b_, Two\r\nflint skeletons formed by new valves, _c_ and _d_, forming within the\r\nfirst skeleton.]\r\n\r\nAnother species of Diatoma (Fig. 8) called _Diatoma vulgare_, is a\r\nvery simple and common form, and will help to explain how these plants\r\ngrow. The two flinty valves _a, b_ inside the cell are not quite the\r\nsame size; the older one _a_ is larger than the younger one _b_ and\r\nfits over it like the cover of a pill-box. As the plant grows, the\r\ncell enlarges and forms two more valves, one _c_ fitting into the\r\ncover _a_, so as to make a complete box _ac_, and a second, _d_, back\r\nto back with _c_, fitting into the valve _b_, and making another\r\ncomplete _bd_. This goes on very rapidly, and in this plant each new\r\ncell separates as it is formed, and the free diatoms move about quite\r\nactively in the water.\r\n\r\nIf you consider for a moment, you will see that, as the new valves\r\nalways fit into the old ones, each must be smaller than the last, and\r\nso there comes a time when the valves have become too small to go on\r\nincreasing. Then the plant must begin afresh. So the two halves of the\r\nlast cell open, and throwing out their flinty skeletons, cover\r\nthemselves with a thin jelly layer, and form a new cell which grows\r\nlarger than any of the old ones. These, which are spore-cells, then\r\nform flinty valves inside, and the whole thing begins again.\r\n\r\nNow, though the plants themselves die, or become the food of minute\r\nanimals, the flinty skeletons are not destroyed, but go on\r\naccumulating in the waters of the ponds, lakes, rivers, and seas, all\r\nover the world. Untold millions have no doubt crumbled to dust and\r\ngone back into the waters, but untold millions also have survived. The\r\ntowns of Berlin in Europe and of Richmond in the United States are\r\nactually built upon ground called \"infusorial earth,\" composed almost\r\nentirely of valves of these minute diatoms which have accumulated to a\r\nthickness of more than eighty feet! Those under Berlin are fresh-water\r\nforms, and must have lived in a lake, while those of Richmond belong\r\nto salt-water forms. Every inch of the ground under those cities\r\nrepresents thousands and thousands of living plants which flourished\r\nin ages long gone by, and were no larger than those you will see\r\npresently under the microscope.\r\n\r\nThese are a very few of the microscopic inhabitants of my pond, but,\r\nas you will confuse them if I show you too many, we will conclude with\r\ntwo rather larger specimens, and examine them carefully. The first,\r\ncalled the Cydippe, is a lovely, transparent living ball, which I want\r\nto explain to you because it is so wondrously beautiful. The second,\r\nthe Sea-mat or Flustra, looks like a crumpled drab-colored seaweed,\r\nbut is really composed of many thousands of grottos, the homes of tiny\r\nsea-animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9. _Cydippe Pileus_.\r\n\r\n1, Animal with tentacles _t_, bearing small tendrils _t'_. 2, Body of\r\nanimal enlarged. _m_, Mouth. _c_, Digestive cavity. _s_, Sac into\r\nwhich the tentacles are withdrawn. _p_, Bands with comb-like plates.\r\n3, Portion of a band enlarged to show the moving plates _p_.]\r\n\r\nLet us take the Cydippe first (1, Fig. 9). I have six here, each in a\r\nseparate tumbler, and could have brought many more, for when I dipped\r\nmy net in the pool yesterday such numbers were caught in it that I\r\nbelieve the retreating tide must just have left a shoal behind. Put a\r\ntumbler on the desk in front of you, and if the light falls well upon\r\nit you will see a transparent ball about the size of a large pea\r\nmarked with eight bright bands, which begin at the lower end of the\r\nball and reach nearly to the top, dividing the outside into sections\r\nlike the ribs of a melon. The creature is so perfectly transparent\r\nthat you can count all the eight bands.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the ball is a slight bulge which is the mouth (_m_ 2,\r\nFig. 9), and from it, inside the ball hangs a long bag or stomach,\r\nwhich opens below into a cavity, from which two canals branch out, one\r\non each side, and these divide again into four canals which go one\r\ninto each of the tubes running down the bands. From this cavity the\r\nfood, which is digested in the stomach, is carried by the canals all\r\nover the body. The smaller tubes which branch out of these canals\r\ncannot be seen clearly without a very strong lens, and the only other\r\nparts you can discern in this transparent ball are two long sacs on\r\neach side of the lower end. These are the tentacle sacs, in which are\r\ncoiled up the tentacles, which we shall describe presently. Lastly you\r\ncan notice that the bands outside the globe are broader in the middle\r\nthan at the ends, and are striped across by a number of ridges.\r\n\r\nIn moving the tumblers the water has naturally been shaken, and the\r\ncreature being alarmed will probably at first remain motionless. But\r\nvery soon it will begin to play in the water, rising and falling, and\r\nswimming gracefully from side to side. Now you will notice a curious\r\neffect, for the bands will glitter and become tinged with prismatic\r\ncolors, till, as it moves more and more rapidly these colors,\r\nreflected in the jelly, seem to tinge the whole ball with colors like\r\nthose on a soap-bubble, while from the two sacs below come forth two\r\nlong transparent threads like spun glass. At first these appear to be\r\nsimple threads, but as they gradually open out to about four or five\r\ninches, smaller threads uncoil on each side of the line till there are\r\nabout fifty on each line. These short tendrils are never still for\r\nlong; as the main threads wave to and fro, some of the shorter ones\r\ncoil up and hang like tiny beads, then these uncoil and others roll\r\nup, so that these graceful floating lines are never two seconds alike.\r\n\r\nWe do not really know their use. Sometimes the creature anchors itself\r\nby them, rising and falling as they stretch out or coil up; but more\r\noften they float idly behind it in the water. At first you would\r\nperhaps think that they served to drive the ball through the water,\r\nbut this is done by a special apparatus. The cross ridges which we\r\nnoticed on the bands are really flat comb-like plates (_p_, Fig. 9),\r\nof which there are about twenty or thirty on each band; and these\r\nvibrate very rapidly, so that two hundred or more paddles drive the\r\ntiny ball through the water. This is the cause of the prismatic\r\ncolors; for iridescent tints are produced by the play of light upon\r\nthe glittering plates, as they incessantly change their angle.\r\nSometimes they move all at once, sometimes only a few at a time, and\r\nit is evident the creature controls them at will.\r\n\r\nThis lovely fairy-like globe, with its long floating tentacles and\r\nrainbow tints, was for a long time classed with the jelly-fish; but it\r\nreally is most nearly related to the sea-anemones, as it has a true\r\ncentral cavity which acts as a stomach, and many other points in\r\ncommon with the _Actinozoa_. We cannot help wondering, as the little\r\nbeing glides hither and thither, whether it can see where it is going.\r\nIt has nerves of a low kind which start from a little dark spot (_ng_)\r\nexactly at the south pole of the ball, and at that point a sense-organ\r\nof some kind exists, but what impression the creature gains from it of\r\nthe world outside we cannot tell.\r\n\r\nI am afraid you may think it dull to turn from such a beautiful being\r\nas this, to the gray leaf which looks only like a dead dry seaweed;\r\nyet you will be wrong, for a more wonderful history attaches to this\r\ncrumpled dead-looking leaf than to the lovely jelly-globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10. THE SEA-MAT OR FLUSTRA (_Flustra foliacea_).\r\n\r\n1, Natural size. 2, Much magnified, _s_, Slit caused by drawing in of\r\nthe animal _a_.]\r\n\r\nFirst of all I will pass round pieces of the dry leaf (1, Fig. 10),\r\nand while you are getting them I will tell you where I found the\r\nliving ones. Great masses of the Flustra, as it is called, line the\r\nbottom and sides of my pool. They grow in tufts, standing upright on\r\nthe rock, and looking exactly like hard gray seaweeds, while there is\r\nnothing to lead you to suspect that they are anything else. Yesterday\r\nI chipped off very carefully a piece of rock with a tuft upon it, and\r\nhave kept it since in a glass globe by itself with sea-water, for the\r\nlittle creatures living in this marine city require a very good supply\r\nof healthy water and air. I have called it a \"marine city,\" and now I\r\nwill tell you why. Take the piece in your hand and run your finger\r\ngently up and down it; you will glide quite comfortably from the lower\r\nto the higher part of the leaf, but when you come back you will feel\r\nyour finger catch slightly on a rough surface. Your pocket lens will\r\nshow you why this is, for if you look through it at the surface of the\r\nleaf you will see it is not smooth, but composed of hundreds of tiny\r\nalcoves with arched tops; and on each side of these tops stand two\r\nshort blunt spines, making four in all, pointing upwards, so as partly\r\nto cover the alcove above. As your finger went up it glided over the\r\nspines, but on coming back it met their points. This is all you can\r\nsee in the dead specimen; I must show you the rest by diagrams, and by\r\nand by under the microscope.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, in the living specimen which I have here, those alcoves\r\nare not open as in the dead piece, but covered over with a transparent\r\nskin, in which, near the top of the alcove just where the curve\r\nbegins, is a slit (_s_ 2, Fig. 10) Unfortunately, the membrane\r\ncovering this alcove is too dense for you to distinguish the parts\r\nwithin. Presently, however, if you are watching a piece of this living\r\nleaf in a flat water-cell under the microscope, you will see the slit\r\nslowly open, and begin to turn as it were inside out, exactly like the\r\nfinger of a glove, which has been pushed in at the tip, gradually\r\nrises up when you put your finger inside it. As this goes on, a bundle\r\nof threads appears, at first closed like a bud, but gradually opening\r\nout into a crown of tentacles, each one clothed with hairs. Then you\r\nwill see that the slit was not exactly a slit after all, but the round\r\nedge where the sac was pushed in. Ah! you will say, you are now\r\nshowing me a polyp like those on the sertularian tree. Not so fast, my\r\nfriend; you have not studied what is still under the covering skin and\r\nhidden in the living animal. I have, however, prepared a slide with\r\nthis membrane removed and there you can observe the different parts,\r\nand learn that each one of these alcoves contains a complete animal,\r\nand not merely one among many mouths, like the polyp on Sertularia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11. DIAGRAM OF THE ANIMAL IN THE FLUSTRA OR\r\nSEA-MAT.\r\n\r\n1, Animal protruding. 2, Animal retracted in the sheath, _sh_,\r\nCovering sheath, _s_, Slit. _t_, Tentacles. _m_, Mouth. _th_, Throat,\r\n_st_, Stomach. _i_, Intestine, _r_, Retractor muscle, _e_, Egg-forming\r\nparts. _g_, Nerve-ganglion.]\r\n\r\nEach of these little beings (_a_, Fig. 10) living in its alcove has a\r\nmouth, throat, stomach, intestine, muscles, and nerves starting from\r\nthe ganglion of nervous matter, besides all that is necessary for\r\nproducing eggs and sending forth young ones. You can trace all these\r\nunder the microscope (see 2, Fig. 11) as the creature lies curiously\r\ndoubled up in its bed, with its body bent in a loop; the intestine\r\n_i_, out of which the refuse food passes, coming back close up to the\r\nslit. When it is at rest, the top of the sac in which it lies is\r\npulled in by the retractor muscle _r_, and looks, as I have said, like\r\nthe finger of a glove with the top pushed in. When it wishes to feed\r\nthis top is drawn out by muscles running round the sac, and the\r\ntentacles open and wave in the water (1, Fig. 11).\r\n\r\nLook now at the alcoves, the homes of these animals; see how tiny they\r\nare and how closely they fit together. Mr. Gosse, the naturalist, has\r\nreckoned that there are six thousand, seven hundred and twenty alcoves\r\nin a square inch; then if you turn the leaf over you will see that\r\nthere is another set, fixed back to back with these, on the other\r\nside, making in all, thirteen thousand, four hundred and forty\r\nalcoves. Now a moderate-sized leaf of flustra measures about three\r\nsquare inches, taking all the rounded lobes into account, so you will\r\nsee we get forty thousand, three hundred and twenty as a rough\r\nestimate of the number of beings on this one leaf. But if you look at\r\nthis tuft I have brought, you will find it is composed of twelve such\r\nleaves, and this after all is a very small part of the mass growing\r\nround my pool. Was I wrong, then, when I said my miniature ocean\r\ncontains as many millions of beings as there are stars in the heavens?\r\n\r\nYou will want to know how these leaves grew, and it is in this way.\r\nFirst a little free swimming animal, a mere living sac provided with\r\nlashes, settles down and grows into one little horny alcove, with its\r\nlive creature inside, which in time sends off from it three to five\r\nbuds, forming alcoves all round the top and sides of the first one,\r\ngrowing on to it. These again bud out, and you can thus easily\r\nunderstand that, in this way, in time a good-sized leaf is formed.\r\nMeanwhile the creatures also send forth new swimming cells, which\r\nsettle down near to begin new leaves, and thus a tuft is formed; and\r\nlong after the beings in earlier parts of the leaf have died and left\r\ntheir alcoves empty, those round the margin are still alive and\r\nspreading....\r\n\r\nIf you can trace the spore-cells and urns in the seaweeds, observe the\r\npolyps in the Sertularia, and count the number of mouths on a branch\r\nof my animal fringe (Sertularia tenella); if you make acquaintance\r\nwith the Thuricolla in its vase, and are fortunate enough to see one\r\ndivide in two; if you learn to know some of the beautiful forms of\r\ndiatoms, and can picture to yourself the life of the tiny inhabitants\r\nof the Flustra; then you will have used your microscope with some\r\neffect, and be prepared for an expedition to my pool, where we will go\r\ntogether some day to seek new treasures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\nAGASSIZ, J.L.R., naturalist, born in Switzerland, 1807; died,\r\nCambridge, Mass., 1873.
