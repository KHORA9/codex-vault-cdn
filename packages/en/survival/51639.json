Ekblaw_\r\n\r\n\r\nA very fair indication of the thrift and general prosperity of a farmer\r\nis the method he employs in caring for his tools. Shiftlessness, waste,\r\nlack of energy, constant buying and heavy burdens of debt will accompany\r\npoor care. Good care is an indication of shrewdness, business ability,\r\nlong-lived machinery, comfortable bank balances and the assurance of a\r\npeaceful, prosperous future.\r\n\r\nTo the progressive man, figures speak more forcibly than does the most\r\npersuasive lecturer on economic topics. The report of the United States\r\nCensus for 1910 contains some figures that bear a distinct message to\r\nthe farmers of the country. In 1900 the value of all farm property in\r\nthe shape of farm implements and machinery was $749,775,970; in 1910\r\nthis same value had increased to $1,265,149,783, representing an\r\nincrease of 68.7 per cent. This increase can be ascribed mainly to\r\nincreased quantity rather than to higher prices, for the increase in\r\nprice of farm machinery has been comparatively slight. It means that the\r\nfarmers are realizing the benefits to be derived from the use of\r\nlabor-saving machinery. In 1900 the acreage of improved land in farms\r\nwas 414,498,487; in 1910 this became 478,451,750, an increase of only\r\n15.4 per cent. These figures may be a little more significant if\r\nexpressed in the following way: In 1900 there was $1.80 worth of\r\nmachinery for each acre of improved farm land; in 1910 this had\r\nincreased to $2.65, or an increase of over 47 per cent.\r\n\r\nThese figures will immediately indicate an opportunity for the\r\nfurtherance of economic agriculture. With so much capital invested in\r\nequipment, the American farmer would certainly be a very bad business\r\nman indeed if he did not take some means of protecting this equipment\r\nto reduce depreciation and to increase its length of life. The question\r\nhas sometimes been asked, does it pay to house farm machinery? Is it not\r\na better practice not to give any special care to the machinery but use\r\nit as long as it will run without care then buy newer and more\r\nup-to-date equipment?\r\n\r\nThe situation bears some consideration. According to Census figures, the\r\naverage investment per farm in farm machinery is almost exactly $200.\r\nThis, however, is the case when every sort of farm is included, and\r\nsince the Census Bureau’s definition of a farm is extremely liberal it\r\nwould not be practical for our purposes. A fair estimate of the average\r\nvalue of farm machinery on a farm is $1,000. No reliable figures are\r\navailable to indicate the rate of depreciation of farm machinery; one\r\nfarmer will take excellent care of his binder and it may do service for\r\ntwenty or twenty-five years, while another farmer will leave his binder\r\nin the middle of the field where the last stalk of grain was cut, and it\r\nwould be surprising if his machine could operate satisfactorily for more\r\nthan five seasons. To take ten years as the average life of farm\r\nmachinery is certainly to be considered conservative.\r\n\r\nMost farm machines are well and substantially constructed and will\r\nrender satisfactory and efficient service with slight repairs for a much\r\nlonger term of years than the average which has just been given. It is\r\nentirely safe to assume that the average length of efficient service can\r\nbe increased to fifteen years providing proper care is given. It is\r\nalmost equally safe to assume that the average life of uncared-for\r\nmachinery will not be much more than five years.\r\n\r\nThe farmer who has a thousand dollars worth of machinery to which he\r\ngives no care and attention will then have an annual reduction in value\r\nof $200, besides his interest charge of $60 on his investment or a total\r\ndebit of $260. The farmer who properly houses his machinery will have an\r\nannual deduction of $66.66 for depreciation and the same interest charge\r\nof $60. He will have, in addition, an annual charge of $25 for interest\r\nand depreciation on his building if it cost $250, or a total of $151.66,\r\nwhich is $108.34 less than that of his improvident neighbor. The careful\r\nfarmer then may consider that he has in his implement house an\r\ninvestment representing over $1,800 as shown by the saving it brings\r\nhim; as a simple implement shed can be built for $250, a net profit of\r\nan interest-paying $1,550 remains. Putting the problem in another way,\r\non many farms the savings on machinery will pay for a shed in two or\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Details of Simple Implement Shed\r\n\r\nOnly one wide sliding door is shown, though another smaller door can be\r\ninserted if desired. The truss construction shown in Fig. 10 is used\r\nabove the wide door. Either vertical or horizontal siding may be used,\r\nthe former being simple and satisfactory construction. The front wall\r\nmay be omitted in localities where inclement weather is uncommon.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Exterior of Open Type of Implement Shed]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Perspective of Framing of Open Type of Implement\r\nShed]\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the small tractor is becoming an extremely\r\npopular source of farm power, special consideration should be given to\r\nits shelter. The tractor is an implement that would be extremely likely\r\nto be injured as a result of exposure to weather. It is entirely\r\npossible that the damage which may be done to this one single machine in\r\none winter’s exposure may be sufficient to pay for the cost of a machine\r\nshed which will house all the implements on the farm.\r\n\r\nSo much for the economic side. The figures that have just been given\r\nrelate only to a very conservative case. On many farms the saving would\r\nbe a great deal more. Besides this there are other things of which the\r\nvalue cannot be estimated, such as the benefit of having a machine that\r\nwill operate when it is called upon to do so; the added value an\r\nimplement shed gives to the farm; and the additional prestige which will\r\nredound to the owner of the farm.\r\n\r\nThe careful farmer will, of course, find that criticisms of\r\nill-cared-for machinery do not apply to him; he has a machine shed, and\r\nknows the value of paint, oil, and grease in extending the life of\r\nimplements. His equipment always looks new, for as rust breaks through\r\nthe protecting coat of paint, a new coat is immediately applied; and his\r\nplowshares, discs, cultivator shovels, and other bright parts of\r\nimplements are always given a thorough coating of grease before being\r\nput away for the winter. As a result, his implements are ready for\r\nbusiness when spring comes and time is valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESIGN OF THE BUILDING\r\n\r\n\r\nIn preparing the design for machine sheds one of the first\r\nconsiderations is that of economy. A machine shed is a building which is\r\nalmost always used for no other purpose than to shelter machinery. It is\r\nnot like a bin for the storage of grain where strength is an exceedingly\r\nimportant factor nor is it like a barn where so many operations are\r\ncarried on within; consequently the simplest and cheapest structure that\r\nis consistent with reasonable durability is the one that is the most\r\nadvisable. Wood is a product available in every section and is the\r\ncheapest and most suitable material for the construction of an implement\r\nshed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Details of Open Type of Implement Shed\r\n\r\nFraming of 6x6 posts, thoroughly braced. Ends may be boarded or left\r\nopen as desired. Foundation piers act as wheel guards. Width between\r\nposts can be varied to suit requirements.]\r\n\r\nPaint, the great preservative, should be applied to all farm\r\nbuildings. The initial cost of two coats of good paint is not\r\nprohibitive; the durability of the wood may be increased almost\r\nindefinitely if the surface is kept covered to prevent the ingress of\r\nthe spores of decay. The prosperous farmer’s buildings are always kept\r\npainted, not only to preserve the wood, but to improve the appearance of\r\nthe buildings themselves.\r\n\r\nOn new wood, two coats are usually sufficient. The first coat should\r\ncontain mainly oil, with a small amount of the base and coloring\r\npigments, so that it will permeate every pore; the second coat should be\r\nheavier, containing less oil and more pigment. Surfaces that have been\r\npainted can be kept in good condition by the occasional application of a\r\nsingle coat.\r\n\r\nThe planning of an implement shed will require data as to the number and\r\nsize of machines and the amount of space that each will occupy. The\r\narrangement of the machines so as to make them easily accessible at\r\ntimes when they are most needed is also important, e. g., a binder being\r\nused but once a year may well occupy a far corner, leaving a space near\r\nthe door for the mower and plow, implements which are used oftener and\r\nfor longer periods than the binder. The manure spreader, wagons and\r\nbuggies are used so much throughout the year that they should be\r\nespecially accessible. Table I, pages 19 and 20, gives the floor space\r\nrequired for most farm machines; the height of the machine is also\r\ngiven. Of course, it is entirely possible to crowd machines together as\r\nthey are put into the shed, and so much saving in room can be\r\naccomplished in this way that little clearance space need be left. For\r\ninstance, the outer edge of a binder platform can be easily raised\r\nseveral feet, provided a pair of reel slats with the attached arms are\r\nremoved, and in this space beneath the platform can be stored such\r\nimplements as hand drill, walking plows, etc. Similar opportunities for\r\neconomy in space can very easily be found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Exterior of Wide Enclosed Implement Shed]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Perspective of Framing of Wide Enclosed Implement\r\nShed]\r\n\r\nIn general the construction of a machine shed is that of the very\r\nsimplest; yet utility and beauty can be very easily combined with\r\nsimplicity. Since the building is not subjected to any heavy load, as\r\nwould be the case with a crib or a barn, the framing is just\r\nsufficiently strong to safely hold the wall and roof covering and to\r\nprevent collapse of the building from wind or snow and ice loads. Very\r\noften 2x4’s or 4x4’s constitute the studs or posts and no heavier stock\r\nis used throughout the building. In wide sheds it may be found\r\nnecessary to use larger stuff and especially in the plate above the wide\r\ndoorway. A two-story machine shed will, of course, require heavier and\r\nmore substantial framing, but a two-story shed is comparatively rare. A\r\nfloor may or may not be used as the owner may desire. It is likely to\r\nprove somewhat expensive in first cost and in maintenance, though for\r\nconvenience it is much to be desired, especially if any repair work is\r\nto be done in the building.\r\n\r\nThe roof may be of almost any style from the simple single pitch shed\r\nroof to the modified shed roof or the ordinary double pitch gable roof.\r\nIt is desirable that the pitch should be not less than one-quarter in\r\norder to get the greatest life out of the shingles, which are likely to\r\ncollect moisture and give shorter service where the pitch is quite flat.\r\nThe foundation of a machine shed will naturally not be designed for\r\ngreat strength except in the case of a two-story structure, since the\r\nonly load which it has to support is that of the superstructure itself.\r\nA footing 12 to 16 inches wide at the bottom and extending down a foot\r\nor 15 inches into solid soil will support a building of this kind.\r\nHowever, if a concrete floor is put in the building as is sometimes done\r\nin the more expensive ones, it will be well to extend the foundation\r\nwall and footing to a point below the frost line, which will vary from a\r\nfoot to three feet according to climate.\r\n\r\nSills are usually not necessary in the simple framing of machine sheds.\r\nThe posts can be set directly upon foundation walls and fastened in any\r\none of many different ways that have been devised. Timbers are more\r\nsubject to decay at the ends than elsewhere, consequently it is\r\nadvisable to treat them at this point with a preservative such as\r\ncreosote. This will add greatly to the durability. The foundation wall\r\nshould be brought up some distance above the ground so as to further\r\nprotect the bottom timbers from moisture. This above-ground extension\r\nmust be omitted at doorways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Details of a Wide Enclosed Implement Shed\r\n\r\nStrong framing is necessary to insure durability in this structure.\r\nMembers may be solid or built up. Details of one form of roof truss are\r\nshown in Fig. 11. Note solid foundation. Doors may be located to suit\r\nrequirements.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most serious problems in the design of a machine shed is the\r\ninsertion of doors. Wide doors are an absolute necessity, especially for\r\ncertain machines. An eight-foot door is large enough for the majority of\r\nfarm machines, even allowing the modern binder with its folding grain\r\ndividers to enter in safety. The wide drill, the rake, and several other\r\nimplements require a much wider door than this and it may be necessary\r\nto provide an opening 12 or even 14 feet wide. This leaves a long\r\nunsupported section of the plate directly above the doorway. To keep\r\nit and the roof from sagging, special provision must be made either by\r\nputting in an exceptionally strong plate at this point, by building up a\r\nsmall wooden truss, or by making a truss of wood and iron as shown in\r\nthe illustration. (Fig. 10.)\r\n\r\nThe doors themselves should be very solidly and substantially made. It\r\nis a matter of good practice to have as few doors as possible. In the\r\naverage machine shed one 8-foot door and one 12 or 14-foot door are\r\nsufficient to meet requirements. A door wider than four feet should not\r\nbe swung on hinges under any circumstances, as it is sure to pull out\r\nthe hinges or to sag very badly. Sliding doors of good construction are\r\nto be recommended in preference to hinged doors (Fig. 12). It is\r\nentirely possible to make a good close-fitting door of this type and\r\nthere need never be any trouble in its operation.\r\n\r\nThe use of other buildings for the storage of farm implements is not a\r\ndesirable procedure except in certain instances, such as keeping wagons\r\nin the driveway of cribs, leaving the spreader at the end of an alleyway\r\nof a barn for convenience in loading, etc. In general, other buildings\r\nare much more expensive than a machine shed and those portions of them\r\ndevoted to the storage of farm implements could in most cases be more\r\nprofitably used, especially when the very small unit floor-space cost of\r\na machine shed is taken into consideration. Then, too, if a special\r\nplace is not provided for the implements, the farm animals may come in\r\ncontact with them, causing injury of the animals or damage to the\r\nmachines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREPRESENTATIVE TYPES OF SHEDS\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Simple Shed Type.= The needs of the average farm for a cheap,\r\neasily built implement shed are met by this building. Illustrations of\r\nthis type of shed are shown in Figs. 1, 2 and 3. The framing consists of\r\n6x6 posts set on a light 1:2½:5 mixture concrete foundation at intervals\r\nof eight feet, the plate consisting of two 2x6’s. Short diagonal braces\r\ncan be set in underneath between the plate and the post in order to give\r\nthe plate further support. The rafters for a span of 18 feet should be\r\nat least 2x6 and better 2x8, set not less than two feet apart on\r\ncenters. The wall covering may consist of vertical siding, either 10 or\r\n12-inch boards, with the cracks covered by ogee battens. For horizontal\r\nsiding, studs are necessary; these should be 2x4’s, placed not over 3\r\nfeet apart. Either drop-siding, German or novelty siding or ordinary\r\nweather-boarding may be used satisfactorily, but the latter is somewhat\r\nlight for a building of this kind and would probably not be as durable\r\nas the others mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Detail of Truss Over Large Doors in Implement\r\nShed]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Roof Truss Details\r\n\r\nThe upper illustration (Fig. 10) shows a method of building a truss\r\nabove wide doors to prevent sagging of roof. It may be varied to suit\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThe roof trusses shown in Fig. 11 suggest methods of framing for wide\r\nsheds, as in Fig. 3 and Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe building may be entirely enclosed, having the doors on the high\r\nside. The practice of enclosing the building entirely is generally to be\r\nrecommended, though sometimes for the sake of economy and convenience\r\nand in localities where the winds are very constant in their direction,\r\nit may be advisable to omit part of the exterior wall covering, leaving\r\none side open, this side being the one opposite to the direction from\r\nwhich the prevailing winds come.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Open Shed Type.= Under some circumstances the open shed type of\r\nbuilding (shown in Figs. 4, 5 and 6) will be the more suitable. This is\r\nespecially true where wagons, racks and spreaders are used frequently.\r\nThe framing of the building consists simply of 6x6 posts set on concrete\r\npiers at intervals of 9 feet. On these are set 2x6 rafters supporting a\r\ndouble pitched gable roof. The building is opened on both sides but both\r\nends may be enclosed.\r\n\r\nThis building is extremely convenient, although it does not give very\r\nthorough protection to the machines. A wagon or spreader can be driven\r\ndirectly through one of the bays and horses unhitched outside. With a\r\nbuilding 18 feet wide and eaves overhanging one foot, the implements\r\nwill be protected from all but driving rains, though sweeping snow will\r\nhave free access to the interior. The posts are placed nine feet apart\r\nin order to provide sufficient room for driving a team through. It may\r\nbe possible to reduce this dimension to eight feet, or to increase it to\r\n10 feet in case a three-horse team is to be driven through. The concrete\r\npiers supporting the posts are made conical in shape, acting thus as\r\nwheel guards to prevent the hubs of the wheels from striking the posts.\r\n\r\nOne or more bays of the shed may be enclosed if desired to give adequate\r\nshelter to machines, such as mowers, binders, etc., which would suffer\r\nfrom exposure. Of course, the shed as well as the preceding one can be\r\nbuilt to any length desired, though a building more than four times as\r\nlong as it is wide will present a somewhat peculiar appearance on\r\naccount of the long, low roof line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Construction Details\r\n\r\nThese details apply in general to the implement shed plans. The girder\r\nsplice shown makes a firm, solid joint. If double hung sash are used,\r\nstandard window framing is employed, as shown. Wide doors are always\r\nhung on a track; the detail shows weather strip at top, and bracket with\r\nroller at bottom to keep door from swinging out.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Wide Enclosed Type.= A better and a little more expensive type of\r\nimplement shed, yet one perhaps better suited to the average farm is\r\nshown in Figs. 7, 8 and 9. This shed is made 26 feet in width and as\r\nlong as may be necessary, although a building 26x40 will usually be\r\nfound sufficiently large to house the machines on the average\r\ngeneral-purpose farm. The framing of this shed is a little more\r\nsubstantial than in the types previously discussed, consisting of 6x6’s\r\nwith 4x6 plates. Should horizontal siding be used, it will naturally\r\nfollow that instead of using these posts, 2x4 studs will be employed as\r\npreviously described in the simple shed type on page thirteen. The\r\nheight of the walls should be not less than 10 feet, which with the\r\ngable roof will make the building a little more attractive in appearance\r\nthan the one previously described. A span of 26 feet is almost too great\r\nfor the adequate support of the roof unless some device such as truss\r\nbracing and purline is used to give the rafters additional stiffness.\r\n(Fig. 11.)\r\n\r\nExperience has shown that the two widths--18 feet and 26 feet are\r\npeculiarly adaptable to the dimensions of the various farm machines.\r\nUsing the 26-foot width, considerable opportunity is given for the\r\nutilization of the floor space, since a wider floor area unsupported by\r\nposts is available. As far as possible, interior posts should be\r\navoided, for they interfere very seriously in the placing and moving of\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Two-Story Type.= As stated before, the use of a two-story machine\r\nshed is rather rare, for two reasons: First, the additional expense in\r\nmaterial and labor, and, Second, the difficulty of getting machines up\r\nto the second floor. The only advantage that is gained is the doubling\r\nof the floor space under the same roof.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Details of Two-Story Implement Shed\r\n\r\nThe framing in this type of shed must be unusually strong and\r\nsubstantial. The girders and, in fact, all framing members, may be\r\neither solid or built up. A central post is necessary in each framing\r\nunit.]\r\n\r\nThe construction of the building (illustrated in Figs. 13, 14 and 15)\r\nwill necessarily be rather substantial. The framing may consist of 6x6\r\nposts and 4x6 girts, which should be securely joined in order to give\r\nrigidity to the structure. The girts are located at vertical intervals\r\nof not to exceed 5 feet, so as to afford good nailing for vertical\r\nsiding. If horizontal siding is used, the girts may be spaced wider,\r\nsay, one each at the top, bottom, and middle of the post, while 2x6\r\nstuds are set in on which to nail the boards. Diagonal bracing is a\r\ndecided advantage. The building may be constructed either 18 or 26 feet\r\nwide, and it is seldom that a building longer than 40 feet will be\r\nnecessary. The foundation should be much more substantial than in the\r\ntypes previously described. It should extend well below the frost line\r\nand be almost as strong as that used for barns.\r\n\r\nThe second floor will be used for the storage of the lighter machines\r\nsuch as small plows, harrows, drills and all the lighter tools which\r\nmake up the farmer’s equipment; while the first floor will be utilized\r\nfor the storage of the heavier machines such as binders, wagons, etc.\r\nGetting the lighter machines up to the second floor may be accomplished\r\nin one of two ways. An ordinary block and tackle can be utilized either\r\nthrough an outside door in the gable of the roof or through a hole in\r\nthe floor in the interior of the building. If space is available the\r\nconstruction of a rather steep runway outside the building and leading\r\nto the second floor may be advantageous. This runway can be constructed\r\nof rather light material, using a pair of 4x6’s for joists, and flooring\r\nthem with rough 2-inch stuff. An angle of 30 degrees with the horizontal\r\nwill make it possible to pull machines up the runway with only a small\r\namount of labor. This arrangement has been found to be superior to the\r\nuse of a hoist. It can be used to the best advantage when the shed is\r\nlocated on the slope of a rather steep hill.\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\nFloor Space and Height of Space Required to House Common Farm\r\nImplements.\r\n\r\n                                                         Floor   Height\r\n                                                         Space  of Space\r\n        Implements--                                    in Feet  in Feet\r\n\r\n  Plows--\r\n  Walking                                                 8x3       3\r\n  Sulky and horse gang (tongue off; add 10 ft. for\r\n    tongue)                                               8x6       4\r\n  Engine gang                                            16x7       5\r\n\r\n  Harrows--\r\n  Spike tooth, per section                                5x5       2\r\n  Spring tooth, per section                               5x4       1½\r\n  Single disc, 8 ft. with truck (tongue off)              6x9       4\r\n  Double disc, 7 ft. with truck (tongue off)              8x8       4\r\n\r\n  Weeder--\r\n  (Thills on)                                            13x8       4\r\n\r\n  Grain Drills--\r\n  12x7 (tongue off; add 10 ft. for tongue)                5x8       5\r\n  16x7 with press attachment (tongue off)                7x11       5\r\n\r\n  Rollers--\r\n  Smooth                                                 3x10       4½\r\n  Corrugated, single (tongue off; add 10 ft. for tongue) 3x10       4\r\n  Corrugated, double                                      4x8       4\r\n\r\n  Corn Planter--\r\n  Two row (tongue off; add 10 ft. for tongue)            5½x6       3½\r\n\r\n  Cultivators--\r\n  Walking, one horse                                      7x2       3½\r\n  Riding, single row (tongue off; add 10 ft. for tongue)  8x5       4\r\n  Riding, two row (tongue off; add 10 feet for tongue)   8x10       4\r\n  Alfalfa (tongue off; add 10 ft. for tongue)             7x6       5\r\n\r\n  Mower--\r\n  6 ft.

Fig. 16]\r\n\r\n  “When it comes to actual waste, the Great American Desert with its\r\n  constant canopy of blue sky over it has very little on the Great\r\n  American Machine Shed. The chief difference is that the former is\r\n  found in a particular locality only, while the latter extends from\r\n  coast to coast. Both are in the open, both represent zero in\r\n  profitable and economical usage, and both need the undivided attention\r\n  of conservation experts.”--Tractor Farming.\r\n\r\n\r\nWood “Where Best”\r\n\r\nThe legitimate use of lumber where it is best, or by proper selection or\r\ntreatment can be made to serve economically and safely, is the aim of\r\nthe lumbermen in publishing a series of bulletins on Farm Structures.\r\nWood has for so long been the most widely used building material that\r\nits availability and importance have either been taken for granted or\r\nlost sight of. It is helpful to review the outstanding features of the\r\npresent situation:\r\n\r\n  Wood remains the most universal, most adaptable building material in\r\n  the world.\r\n\r\n  The supply is ample for all requirements, and the kinds and grades\r\n  best suited for all purposes are obtainable everywhere.\r\n\r\n  In cost it remains one of the cheapest materials.\r\n\r\n  It is the lightest building material known, and the strongest, weight\r\n  for weight.\r\n\r\n  Its qualities are known; it is easy to work; it can be cut and shaped\r\n  by any one into the myriad uses required for the shelter and comfort\r\n  of man.\r\n\r\n  There is no material more beautiful in appearance, more susceptible to\r\n  artistic finish, nor which is as productive of sentiment and\r\n  satisfaction for home building.\r\n\r\n  Wood is a non-conductor of heat,--cool in summer and warm in winter.\r\n\r\nThe relative qualities of durability, serviceability and workability\r\nshould be considered in selecting wood for homes and farm buildings.\r\n=Consult the local lumber dealer.= His knowledge and advice will assure\r\ncheaper, more stable buildings.\r\n\r\nExcept where naturally durable woods are available, a preservative\r\ntreatment will prove economical for timber exposed to moisture and\r\ndecay, as sills, basement flooring, fence posts; and in similar\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Other Farm Bulletins.\r\n\r\n  Other Bulletins in this series are upon:\r\n\r\n  Dairy and General Purpose Barns\r\n  Ice Houses\r\n  Garages\r\n  Silos\r\n  Poultry Houses\r\n  Grain Storage Buildings\r\n  Farm Residences\r\n  Swine Houses\r\n  The Preservative Treatment of Farm Timbers\r\n\r\n  Ask for those that will be helpful to you.
