These surveys include the usual surveying technical\r\nprocedures and the examination and documentation of various reports and\r\ncertificates necessary to substantiate legal procedures.\r\n\r\nUnderstanding the basis for performance of mineral surveys is imperative\r\nfor the United States Mineral Surveyors as well as for those who are\r\ninvolved with processing mineral survey returns, those who evaluate\r\nclaim validity, and for those cadastral surveyors who are involved in\r\nretracing original mineral surveys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis _Guide_ was prepared by John V. Meldrum, U.S. Mineral Surveyor\r\n(ret.) under the direction of the Cadastral and Mapping Training Staff,\r\nDenver Service Center, Bureau of Land Management. Mr. Meldrum’s many\r\nyears of expertise in mineral surveys, and his professionalism as a\r\nmineral surveyor are invaluable elements of its contents.\r\n\r\nIn compiling the _Guide_, assistance was obtained from all of the State\r\nOffices of the BLM, and gratitude is expressed to those cadastral survey\r\nindividuals who gave of their time and advice in assisting with its\r\npreparation. The contribution of the Cadastral Survey Staff of the\r\nCalifornia State Office is particularly acknowledged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               CHAPTER I\r\n                                                             Mining Laws\r\n\r\n\r\nMining Districts\r\n\r\n=1–1= When gold was discovered at Sutter’s Mill in California in 1849 no\r\nprovisions had been made by the Congress of the United States for the\r\ndisposition of minerals on the public domain of the West. After a feeble\r\nattempt at leasing, the copper and iron deposits of the Great Lakes\r\nregion as well as the lead deposits of Missouri were sold outright to\r\nthe highest bidder with minimum prices set from $2.50 to $5.00 per acre.\r\nConsequently, the prospectors and miners of California formed mining\r\ndistricts to provide self-government and maintain law and order. These\r\ndistricts could be as small as a square mile, while others covered an\r\narea several townships in size.\r\n\r\n=1–2= The functions of a district were to provide rules governing the\r\nsize of claims, manner of location and discovery requirements, recording\r\nof locations, work required to hold a claim and period of absence\r\nconstituting abandonment.\r\n\r\nThe miners were not without precedents in establishing their rules. In\r\nEurope the Germanic or Prussian laws provided for the discovery and\r\nlocation of mineral deposits with royalties going to the crown and the\r\nsurface owner. The discoverer received a larger claim than subsequent\r\nlocators. Periods of idleness without cause would open the ground to\r\nrelocation. A court system was provided for the mining industry.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian law was the basis for English law and subsequently Spanish\r\nand Mexican law. The Mexican law provided that three claims went to the\r\ndiscoverer of a vein in a new district and two claims to the discoverer\r\nof a new vein in an old district. Claims were 200 varas long and up to\r\n200 varas wide, depending on dip, a vara being about a yard. Provision\r\nwas also made for discovery work and periodic labor.\r\n\r\nAs the first claims in California were for placer gold, the miners were\r\nallowed a claim about 10 feet along the stream and as far back as the\r\ndeposit ran. When lodes were discovered, the discoverer was usually\r\nallowed two claims 100 feet long along the vein and 50 feet wide; then\r\nothers could stake one claim of this size on the vein. The miner could\r\nfollow his vein to depth, establishing extralateral rights. Rules were\r\nmade for marking the boundaries of claims and for recording them with\r\nthe district recorder. Miner’s courts were held to settle disputes.\r\nThus, American Mining Law was born.\r\n\r\n=1–3= Today, the mining districts exist in name only. As county\r\ngovernments were set up (recording districts in Alaska which has no\r\ncounties), the mining districts turned their records over to the county\r\nrecorders and left the making and enforcement of local mining laws to\r\nstate or county governments.\r\n\r\nMining districts may still be formed but any regulations that they may\r\nimpose cannot be in conflict with existing law at any level of\r\ngovernment. At this writing, none are known to exist; however, many\r\nlocation certificate forms call for a mining district, as well as the\r\nvarious forms provided by the Bureau of Land Management for the\r\nprocessing of mineral surveys and patents.\r\n\r\nEach state office, except Montana, maintains a map, chart or index of\r\nmining districts although the boundaries may be vague and overlapping.\r\nThese records are available to the public so that they may use a\r\ndistrict name, if available.\r\n\r\nIf a claim is located in an area where no district exists, it is\r\ncustomary to state that there is no organized district or that the claim\r\nis in an unorganized mining district. There is, however, no objection to\r\nusing a commonplace name as a district to aid in identification of the\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  =THE GREGORY LODE, BLACKHAWK—CENTRAL CITY, COLORADO=\r\n\r\n  The first discovery of a gold vein in Colorado. (1858) Gregory, the\r\n    discoverer, was allowed two claims, 50 ft. wide and 100 ft. long;\r\n    others then staked claims 50 ft. wide and 100 ft. along the vein.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nFederal Mining Laws (Title 30, United States Code)\r\n\r\n=1–4= Act of February 27, 1865, Sec. 9 (13 Stat. 441): Recognized that\r\nthe public domain was being appropriated for mining purposes but that\r\nsuch appropriation was by the law of possession and that the paramount\r\ntitle to such lands lay in the United States.\r\n\r\n=1–5= Act of July 26, 1866 (14 Stat. 251): Declared the mineral lands of\r\nthe public domain open to exploration and occupation by citizens of the\r\nUnited States or those who had declared their intentions to become\r\ncitizens. It provided for claims 200 feet in length along the vein for\r\neach locator, with an additional claim for the discoverer, and an\r\nassociation could take up to 3000 feet in length. No width was\r\nspecified, only sufficient ground for working the claim. Extralateral\r\nrights were granted inasmuch as the vein could be followed to any depth,\r\nwith all its dips, angles and variations. The Act also provided for\r\nobtaining patent (fee title) from the United States. It also recognized\r\nlocal customs, rules and mining districts, so far as they were not in\r\nconflict with the laws of the United States. This Act was repealed by\r\nthe Act of May 10, 1872.\r\n\r\n=1–6= Act of July 9, 1870 (16 Stat. 217; 30 U.S.C. 35): Provided for\r\nplacer claims (not covered in the Act of 1866) which included all\r\ndeposits except veins of quartz and other rock in place. They were\r\nlimited in size to 160 acres, either by one person or an association of\r\npersons, subject to entry and patent, and where on surveyed lands\r\nrequired to conform to legal subdivisions. This Act, with modification,\r\nis still in force.\r\n\r\n=1–7= Act of May 10, 1872 (17 Stat. 91; 30 U.S.C. Ch. 2; Title 43\r\nC.F.R.): This Act contains the General Mining Laws which, with\r\namendments, are still in force today. It provides in detail for\r\ndiscovery, location, survey and patent of both lode and placer claims;\r\nalso mill sites. It requires annual labor, or assessment work until\r\npatent. Tunnel sites for the discovery of lodes are also provided for.\r\nThe succeeding pages of this manual will take up and explain the various\r\nprovisions of this Act, with appropriate reference and quotations from\r\nthe Code of Federal Regulations or the U.S. Code, if not covered in the\r\nC.F.R.\r\n\r\n=1–8= Act of March 3, 1872 (30 U.S.C. 71–90): Provided for the location\r\nand purchase of coal; not a mineral subject to the general mining laws.\r\nThis Act was repealed by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920.\r\n\r\n=1–9= Act of May 17, 1884 (30 U.S.C. 49a–49f): Extended the general\r\nmining laws to Alaska.\r\n\r\n=1–10= Act of August 4, 1892 (30 U.S.C. 161): Included building stone\r\nunder the mining laws subject to the provisions governing placer mining\r\nclaims.\r\n\r\n=1–11= Act of February 11, 1897 (29 Stat. 526, 30 U.S.C. 101):\r\nSpecifically included petroleum or other mineral oils as a mineral under\r\nthe general mining laws subject to the provisions governing placer\r\nmining claims. This Act was repealed by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920.\r\n\r\n=1–12= Act of January 31, 1901 (30 U.S.C. 162): Included salt in any\r\nform under the general mining laws subject to the provisions governing\r\nplacer mining claims, limited to one claim per person. This Act was\r\nrepealed by the Mineral Leasing Act of 1920.\r\n\r\n=1–13= Act of April 28, 1904 (30 U.S.C. 34): The monuments on the ground\r\nshall constitute the highest authority as to which lands are patented\r\nnotwithstanding a conflict with the survey record or the calls and\r\ndescriptions recited in the patent. Also, in extending the public land\r\nsurveys, all patented mineral claims shall be segregated from the public\r\nlands as they are monumented on the ground.\r\n\r\n=1–14= Act of February 25, 1920 (30 U.S.C. Chapter 3A): The Mineral\r\nLeasing Act removed deposits of oil, gas, coal, potassium, sodium,\r\nphosphate, oil shale, native asphalt, solid and semi-solid bitumen and\r\nbituminous rock, including oil impregnated rock or sands, and sulphur in\r\nLouisiana and New Mexico from the general mining laws and other laws and\r\nset up a system of leasing for these minerals.\r\n\r\n=1–15= Act of July 31, 1947 (61 Stat. 681): The Materials Act authorized\r\nthe sale of mineral materials if the disposal of such materials was not\r\notherwise expressly authorized by law.\r\n\r\n=1–16= Act of August 13, 1954 (30 U.S.C. 521): Provided for multiple\r\ndevelopment of mineral deposits under the mining and mineral leasing\r\nlaws. All mining claims and mill sites located after this date, and\r\nthose prior to this date that did not preserve their rights, do not\r\ninclude leasable minerals, such minerals being subject to exploration\r\nand development under the Mineral Leasing Act.\r\n\r\n=1–17= Act of July 23, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 601): Removed common varieties of\r\nsand, stone, gravel, pumice (except block pumice), pumicite or cinders\r\nfrom appropriation under the general mining laws. Also restricted the\r\nuse of the surface of unpatented mining claims to that portion necessary\r\nfor the development and mining of the deposit and permitted the federal\r\ngovernment to manage the surface and vegetative resources.\r\n\r\n=1–18= Act of August 11, 1955 (30 U.S.C. Chapter 16): All lands\r\npreviously withdrawn for power sites, except those actually in use or\r\nbeing constructed upon, were restored to mining locations subject to\r\nfuture use for power development under the authority of the United\r\nStates, without reimbursement, and subject to provisions for recording\r\nthe location within 60 days from date of location and assessment work\r\nwithin 60 days of the expiration of the assessment year.\r\n\r\n=1–19= Act of March 18, 1960 (30 U.S.C. 42): Provided for the location\r\nof mill sites in conjunction with placer claims subject to the same\r\nrequirements of survey as placers. This allowed location of mill sites\r\nby legal subdivisions.\r\n\r\n=1–20= Act of September 28, 1962 (76 Stat. 652): Provides for free use\r\nof petrified wood.\r\n\r\n=1–21= Act of December 24, 1970 (30 U.S.C. Chapter 23): This act\r\nprovides for geothermal steam leases and should the lease be terminated,\r\nthe lessee has the right to complete the location of mining claims for\r\nminerals subject to location which would constitute a byproduct if\r\ncommercial production of steam continued. Conversion to a lease under\r\nthe Mineral Leasing Act for lease minerals is provided for if the lease\r\nminerals are capable of being produced in commercial quantities.\r\n\r\n=1–22= Act of October 21, 1976 (43 U.S.C. 1744; 43 C.F.R. 3833): All\r\nunpatented mining claims, including lodes, placers, mill sites and\r\ntunnel sites located prior to this date must be recorded with the proper\r\nstate office of the Bureau of Land Management by filing a copy of the\r\nrecord of the location (or last amended) notice or certificate, as\r\nrequired by state law, together with a map showing the claim and its\r\nrelation to the public land survey or protracted grid, by October 21,\r\n1979; and also provide evidence of assessment work for the preceding\r\nassessment year, or notice of intention to hold, and thereafter prior to\r\nDecember 31 of each calendar year. Claims located after October 21, 1976\r\nshall be recorded within 90 days of date of location and evidence of\r\nassessment work or notice of intention to hold, if assessment work is\r\nnot required, filed prior to December 31 of each calendar year after the\r\nyear of location. Change in ownership must also be recorded and\r\n(presumably) amended location certificates. If these recording\r\nrequirements are not met, the claims are deemed to be abandoned.\r\n\r\n=1–23= Reservations, Grants, Withdrawals and Severance of Minerals:\r\nIndian and military reservations, national parks and monuments are not,\r\nas a rule, open to mineral exploration except in special instances cited\r\nin 1–24 below. National forests are open to mineral exploration,\r\nlocation and patent, but subject to rules and regulations of the Forest\r\nService. National Forest Wilderness Areas are covered in 1–24 below.\r\n\r\nGrants include the Spanish Land Grants, Railroad Grants, and School\r\nGrants (School Sections), most of which included the minerals.\r\n\r\nAt least one Spanish Land Grant, The Sangre de Christo Grant comprising\r\nCostilla County, Colorado, has its own system of mineral surveys.\r\n\r\nArizona has its own rules for locating mining claims on state (school)\r\nlands. Indemnity grants were made in lieu of other lands previously\r\nappropriated, including unsurveyed school sections appropriated in part\r\nunder the mining laws.\r\n\r\nThe Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of December 18, 1971 granted\r\ncertain lands to the natives in Alaska and allowed owners of claims\r\nlocated prior to August 31, 1971 five years to proceed to patent.\r\nRegulations permitted filing an application for mineral survey to be\r\nconsidered an application for patent.\r\n\r\nWithdrawals made under the authority of the President are not subject to\r\nany form of location. Withdrawals under the Act of June 25, 1910 (43\r\nU.S.C. 141, as amended) are subject to location for metalliferous\r\nminerals only. The Act, known as the Pickett Act, authorized the\r\nPresident to make withdrawals for various purposes such as power,\r\nirrigation, classification of lands.\r\n\r\nWithdrawals under the first form Reclamation Act of June 17, 1902 are\r\nnot subject to mining location unless opened under the Act of April 23,\r\n1932. Lands withdrawn under the second form of the Act are subject to\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Land Policy and Management Act of October 21, 1976(43 U.S.C.\r\n1714) provides for withdrawals by the Secretary of the Interior, either\r\non his own motion or at the request of any department or agency head,\r\nwith certain restrictions and limitations. Each withdrawal and\r\nsubsequent restoration must be reviewed to determine if mining locations\r\nare allowed, and under what conditions.\r\n\r\nSeverance occurs when minerals are reserved to the United States in a\r\npatent. Some of the Spanish Land Grants reserved certain minerals such\r\nas gold, silver, quicksilver and antimony.\r\n\r\nThe Act of March 3, 1891 reserved minerals from townsite entries on\r\nmineral land, but each patent should be checked; some of the early\r\npatents reserved only “known lodes.”\r\n\r\nThe Act of July 17, 1914 permitted agricultural entry or purchase of\r\nlands withdrawn for phosphate, nitrate, potash, oil, gas or asphalt with\r\na reservation of these minerals to the United States.\r\n\r\nThe Act of July 20, 1956 permitted the disposition of these minerals\r\ndiscovered and located prior to the Mineral Leasing Act.\r\n\r\nThe Stockraising Homestead Act of December 29, 1916 allowed entry of 320\r\nacres rather than the 160 acre preemption homestead, but reserved the\r\nminerals to the United States, the minerals being subject to disposal\r\nunder the general mining and mineral leasing laws. The surface owner is\r\nprotected by the Act, and a bond must be posted with the Bureau of Land\r\nManagement unless satisfactory arrangements can be made between the\r\nmineral and surface owner (43 C.F.R. 3814).\r\n\r\nLands patented under the Color of Title Act (43 U.S.C. 1068), by\r\nexchange under the Taylor Grazing Act (43 U.S.C. 315g) and by Forest\r\nExchanges (16 U.S.C. 485) with mineral reservation to the United States,\r\nare subject to appropriation under the mining and mineral leasing laws.\r\n\r\nThe Atomic Energy Act of August 1, 1946 reserved fissionable source\r\nmaterial, uranium and thorium, to the United States, but these\r\nprovisions have since been rescinded and such minerals are locatable\r\nunder the mining laws. Mining claims for fissionable source materials\r\ncould be located on lands known to be valuable for coal under the Act of\r\nAugust 11, 1955 (30 U.S.C. 541 through 541i) which expired August 11,\r\n1975.\r\n\r\n=1–24= Areas Subject to Special Mining Laws:\r\n\r\nO & C Lands: The Act of April 8, 1948 (62 Stat. 162) reopened the\r\nrevested Oregon and California Railroad and Reconveyed Coos Bay Wagon\r\nRoad Grant Lands to exploration, location, entry and disposition under\r\nthe United States Mining Laws, but imposed additional requirements\r\nregarding the filing of location certificates, affidavits of annual\r\nlabor, use of timber, etc. See 43 C.F.R. 3821 for details.\r\n\r\nAlaska Public Sale Act of August 30, 1949 (48 U.S.C. 364a–364e)\r\nsegregated for classification and sale certain lands, but reserved the\r\nminerals for disposition under applicable law. Provided compensation to\r\nthe surface owner for damage. See 43 C.F.R. 3822.\r\n\r\nNational Forest Wilderness Areas are open to prospecting and mining\r\nunder existing laws until midnight, December 31, 1983 by which time they\r\nshall be closed except for valid existing rights. Patents will be for\r\nmineral only with title to the surface reserved to the United States,\r\nsubject to certain use to facilitate mining. See 43 C.F.R. 3823.\r\n\r\nCity of Prescott, Arizona Watershed: The Act of January 19, 1933 (16\r\nU.S.C. 482a) restricted future mining locations to minerals only with\r\nrestricted use of the surface. See C.F.R. 3824.\r\n\r\nPapago Indian Reservation, Arizona: The Act of June 18, 1934 (25 U.S.C.\r\n461–479) as amended, restores from temporary withdrawal mineral location\r\nand entry under the United States Mining Laws, but imposes additional\r\nrequirements for recording locations with the superintendent of the\r\nreservation, payment of annual rental to the tribe and a fee in lieu of\r\nthe annual rental at time of patent. See 43 C.F.R. 3825.\r\n\r\nNational Park Service Areas: National parks and national monuments are,\r\nas a general rule, closed to mining, but there are exceptions, subject\r\nto special rules, regulations, and reservations in the patent. These\r\nspecial areas are: Mt. McKinley National Park, Alaska (see 43 C.F.R.\r\n3826.1); Olympic National Park, Washington (see 43 C.F.R. 3826.2); Death\r\nValley National Monument, California (see 43 C.F.R. 3826.3); Glacier Bay\r\nNational Monument, Alaska (see 43 C.F.R. 3826.4); Organ Pipe Cactus\r\nNational Monument, Arizona (see 43 C.F.R. 3826.5). The Act of September\r\n28, 1976 (90 Stat. 1342, 16 U.S.C. 1901) prohibits further mining\r\nlocations in these national parks and monuments.\r\n\r\nKing Range National Conservation Area, California: Mining claims are not\r\nprohibited, but those located after October 21, 1970 are subject to\r\nstrict regulations and inspection of all mining activity (see 43 C.F.R.\r\n3827).\r\n\r\n=1–25= Acquired Lands: Minerals on acquired lands are not generally open\r\nto mineral entry. These minerals are possibly subject to leasing only\r\n(see 43 C.F.R. 3500).\r\n\r\n=1–26= Update: In order that mineral surveyors may keep abreast of new\r\nlaws it is desirable that the Office of Chief, Division of Cadastral\r\nSurvey, Washington, D.C. keep the mineral surveyors advised, furnishing\r\ncopies of the Acts and pertinent regulations, so far as it is\r\npracticable to do so. Mineral surveyors may also keep abreast of new\r\nlegislation through the local offices of the BLM, their congressmen and\r\nby becoming members of local mining associations and attending their\r\nmeetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nState Mining Laws\r\n\r\n=1–27= Both the Acts of 1866 and 1872 provided for recognition of\r\n“_local customs or rules of miners_ in the several mining districts so\r\nfar as the same are applicable and not inconsistent with the laws of the\r\nUnited States.”\r\n\r\n(R.S. 2319, 30 U.S.C. 22). C.F.R. 3831.1 states in part “(c) _complying\r\nwith_ the _State Laws_, regarding the recording of the location in the\r\ncounty recorder’s office, discovery work, etc. As supplemental to the\r\nUnited States mining laws there are _State statutes_ relative to\r\nlocation, manner of recording of mining claims, etc., in the State,\r\nwhich should also be observed in the location of mining claims.”\r\n\r\n43 C.F.R. 3841.4–2 states in part: “... 600 feet in width, but whether\r\nsurface ground of that width can be taken depends upon the local\r\nregulations of _State or Territorial laws_ in force ....” and 43 C.F.R.\r\n3841.4–6 “the location notice must be filed for record in all respects\r\nas required by the _State or Territorial laws_, and local rules and\r\nregulations if there be any.”\r\n\r\nRequirements of State law as to mining locations must be complied with\r\nif they are not repugnant to the United States mining laws. South Dakota\r\nv. Madill, 53 I.D. 195 (1930).\r\n\r\nIt is very clear that State laws must be complied with and some states\r\ngo so far as to state that if the essentials of discovery and location\r\nare not complied with, the claim shall be null and void. Also, location\r\ncertificates that do not contain the information set forth in the law,\r\nincluding an adequate description, shall be void.\r\n\r\nThe mineral surveyors cannot ignore state law, yet there are areas where\r\nthey should not force the claimant to comply, such as failure to do the\r\nnecessary discovery work as long as a discovery point has been\r\ndesignated. In such cases the claimant should be advised of the apparent\r\ndiscrepancy. At his insistence, the survey should be executed and\r\nprocessed to show the facts and conditions as they exist, leaving the\r\nmatter to adjudication during patent proceedings. On the other hand, an\r\ninadequate description in the location certificate is justification for\r\nrequiring an amended certificate.\r\n\r\nEach mineral surveyor should obtain a copy of the state mining laws as\r\nsoon as possible after receiving an order for survey in that state. The\r\nChief, Branch of Cadastral Survey of each state office should have an\r\nup-to-date copy of the laws for his state, and advise the Chief,\r\nDivision of Cadastral Survey at Washington, D.C. of changes as they\r\noccur so that he may keep all mineral surveyors advised.\r\n\r\nCopies of state laws, in pamphlet form, are usually available from the\r\nState Bureau of Mines or Geological Survey, the Secretary of State or\r\nAttorney General.\r\n\r\nDo not confuse state laws pertaining to the location of mining claims on\r\nthe public domain with state laws covering the location of state lands.\r\nArizona, for instance, allows the staking of mining claims on state\r\nlands and publishes rules and regulations governing such appropriation.\r\nMost states, however, lease their minerals.\r\n\r\nFollowing is an abstract of the state laws in force so that mineral\r\nsurveyors and cadastral surveyors will have an immediate source of\r\ninformation. The abstract is by no means complete, but contains only the\r\nessentials, and is not a substitute for the laws themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n1–28 ALASKA\r\n\r\n\r\nLode Claims:\r\n\r\n_Location notice_ containing name of claim, name of locator(s), date of\r\nlocation and approximate bearings and distances between corners shall be\r\nposted at the northeast corner of the claim.\r\n\r\nSubstantial _monuments_ of stone or posts not less than three feet high\r\nand three inches in diameter, marked with name of claim, position or\r\ncorner number and direction of boundary lines to be erected at each\r\ncorner; witness corners shall be marked to indicate position of true\r\ncorner.

Work to be done within 60\r\ndays from date of discovery.\r\n\r\n_Monumentation_: Boundaries to be marked by six substantial monuments of\r\nstone or posts, hewed or marked on the side facing the claim, sunk in\r\nthe ground, one at each corner and at the center of each side line.\r\nWitness corners marked to indicate true point provided for.\r\n\r\n(=NOTE=: The above are prerequisite to filing a location certificate.)\r\n\r\n_Recording_: Within 60 days from date of discovery record a location\r\ncertificate with the county clerk containing the name of the claim, name\r\nof the locator(s), date of location, length along the vein each way from\r\nthe center of discovery shaft, the amount of surface ground claimed on\r\neither side of the discovery shaft, _the discovery shaft being always\r\nequally distant from the side lines_, and a description tied to a\r\nnatural object or if on surveyed land to a section or quarter section\r\ncorner, as shall identify the claim beyond question.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlacer Claims:\r\n\r\n_Location notice_ to be posted on claim containing name of claim, name\r\nof locator(s), date of discovery and number of feet or acres claimed.\r\n\r\n_Discovery Work_: None.\r\n\r\n_Monumentation_: Substantial posts or stone monuments to be placed at\r\neach corner of the claim.\r\n\r\n(=NOTE=: The above are prerequisite to filing a location certificate.)\r\n\r\n_Recording_: Within 90 days after date of discovery record with the\r\ncounty clerk a location certificate containing the name of the claim,\r\ndesignating it as a placer claim, the name of locator(s), the date of\r\nlocation, the number of feet or acres claimed and a description of the\r\nclaim by designation of natural or fixed objects as shall identify the\r\nclaim beyond question.\r\n\r\n\r\nOther:\r\n\r\n_Additional location_ certificate (amendment) and relocation provided\r\nfor.\r\n\r\n_Annual labor_: Affidavits provided to be recorded with the county clerk\r\nwithin 60 days after completion.\r\n\r\n_Surface owners_: Security from the miner provided.\r\n\r\n_Penalties_ are provided for force or threats by two or more persons\r\ndestroying mining property, including notices and amendments, and\r\ndefrauding, cheating or swindling, the latter being a felony.\r\n\r\n\r\nSurvey-Legal Interrelationships\r\n\r\n=1–47= The mineral surveyor and the cadastral surveyor responsible for\r\nprocessing mineral surveys must be thoroughly familiar with both federal\r\nand state law relating to the appropriation of minerals on the public\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\nThe mineral surveyor may be the first detailed contact of the claimant\r\nwith a government official, and he will look to the mineral surveyor for\r\nguidance through the first steps to obtaining patent, i.e., the survey,\r\nincluding discovery and work requirements.\r\n\r\nIf the location does not meet the requirements set forth in the law, the\r\nmineral surveyor may suggest the corrective steps necessary, including\r\nan amended location. If the location certificate is too vague, an\r\namended certificate will be in order. If the development work includes\r\nimprovements that will not count as patent expenditure or if common\r\nimprovements will not meet the tests set forth in the chapter on mineral\r\nsurveys in the _Manual of Surveying Instructions_, the mineral surveyor\r\nshould discuss the matter with the claimant and suggest corrective\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThe matter of a valid discovery or what constitutes sufficient mineral\r\nfor patent is a complicated matter. While the mineral surveyor may\r\ndiscuss the subject in generalities, as set forth in the next chapter,\r\nit is not his duty to rule on it, this being a matter for the mineral\r\nexaminer and adjudicators to determine. He may guide the claimant in\r\nproperly locating and surveying his claims for patent.\r\n\r\nIf the mineral surveyor feels that the claimant is not justified in\r\nproceeding to patent or if he feels that the land is being obtained for\r\npurposes other than mining, he may decline to make the survey, since it\r\nis a matter of private contract.\r\n\r\n=1–48= Relationship of surveyor and attorney: If the claimant has\r\nemployed an attorney-at-law, the surveyor and attorney should work\r\nclosely together.\r\n\r\nThe surveyor should recognize that he is not schooled in the law and\r\nshould respect the attorney’s opinion; on legal matters it is the\r\nattorney’s responsibility.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the attorney is not schooled in surveying and the\r\nsurveyor should guide him in technical matters. The surveyor may refuse\r\nto comply with requests that are in conflict with his requirements of\r\nsurvey and that of the Bureau of Land Management. Doubtful situations\r\nmay be referred to the Bureau of Land Management for further\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\nMany attorneys are not expert in mining law and may require guidance\r\nfrom the mineral surveyor. Should the surveyor find himself in a\r\nsituation where legal advice is necessary, and the claimant has not\r\nemployed an attorney, he should discuss the matter with the claimant and\r\nrecommend obtaining the services of a lawyer.\r\n\r\n=1–49= Extralateral Rights (Apex): Both the Acts of 1866 and 1872\r\ngranted the right to follow a vein downward on its dip beyond the\r\nvertical boundaries of the claim. R.S. 2322, 30 U.S.C. 26 states in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n      “The locators of all mining locations made on any mineral\r\n      vein, lode or ledge situated on the public domain ... shall\r\n      have the exclusive right of possession and enjoyment ... of\r\n      all veins, lodes, and ledges throughout their entire depth,\r\n      the top or apex of which lies inside of such surface lines\r\n      extended downward vertically, although such veins, lodes or\r\n      ledges may so far depart from a perpendicular in their\r\n      course downward as to extend outside the vertical side lines\r\n      of such surface locations. But their right to possession to\r\n      such outside parts of such veins or ledges shall be confined\r\n      to such portions thereof as lie between vertical planes\r\n      drawn downward as above described, through the end lines of\r\n      their locations, so continued in their own direction that\r\n      such planes will intersect such exterior parts of such veins\r\n      or lodes.”\r\n\r\nExtralateral rights exist only when the end lines are substantially\r\nparallel and then only when the apex of the vein passes through at least\r\none of the end lines.\r\n\r\nIf the vein passes through both end lines it may be followed with all\r\nits dips and variations beyond the side lines within the vertical planes\r\nof the end lines (see Claim A of Figure 1).\r\n\r\nWhere the vein passes through one end line and one side line, one end\r\nline is theoretically moved by protraction to the point where the vein\r\nleaves the side line, and extralateral rights apply on the vein only to\r\nthe extent of the foreshortened claim (see Claim B of Figure 1).\r\n\r\nWhere the vein leaves the claim through both side lines, there are no\r\nextralateral rights and the vein may be mined only in the area contained\r\nwithin the vertical boundaries of the claim (see Claim C of Figure 1).\r\n\r\nTwo claims might be located along the strike of the same vein in such a\r\nmanner as to produce diverging end lines as in Claims D and E of Figure\r\n1. In this case a portion of the vein beneath the surface (F) belongs to\r\nneither claim and must be appropriated by staking claims the vertical\r\nboundaries of which will encompass the unappropriated segment.\r\n\r\nWhere veins of two different claims unite on the dip, the portion below\r\nthe junction belongs to the senior claim; if the veins cross, rather\r\nthan unite, the junction belongs to the senior claim.\r\n\r\nAn outcrop is not an apex in the case of bedded deposits that are tilted\r\nor outcrop on a canyon wall. Claims located on the outcrops of bedded\r\ndeposits have no extralateral rights.\r\n\r\nWhere the vein is wider than patent, the extralateral rights belong to\r\nthe senior claim. A claim located on the dip, though senior, loses the\r\nvein to a junior claim properly located on the apex. The latter issues\r\nhave been the subject of numerous lawsuits, and there have been\r\ndecisions favoring each side.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 1, Claims A, B, C, D and E were located along the apex of a\r\nvein dipping to the south in alphabetical order, “A” being the oldest\r\nclaim. The portions of the vein belonging to each claim are shown by\r\nvarious cross-hatching.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1\r\n]\r\n\r\n=1–50= Riparian Rights: Although not a general rule, occasions have\r\narisen when a mining claim adjoins a navigable body of water and the\r\nshoreline or mean high water mark becomes the boundary of the claim. In\r\nsuch instances it is proper to run such a boundary as a meander line and\r\nthe field notes of the mineral survey should state that it is a meander\r\nline of the mean high water line and that the corners of such line are\r\nmeander corners. The situation is well stated in _Alaska United Gold\r\nMining Co. et al. v. Cincinnati-Alaska Mining Co. et al._, decided April\r\n18, 1916, 45 L.D. 330:\r\n\r\n      “The rule as to meander lines is applicable to mining\r\n      claims, and where in the course of an official patent survey\r\n      of a mining claim abutting upon a navigable body of water a\r\n      meander line has been run, which follows as nearly as\r\n      practicable the shore line of the water, such shore line and\r\n      not the meander line, must be taken as the boundary of the\r\n      claim when patented according to the plat and field notes of\r\n      the survey.”\r\n\r\n      “Where one of the boundaries of a patented mining claim is a\r\n      navigable body of water, all accretions formed after survey\r\n      and prior to entry and patent of the tract passed under the\r\n      patent, and all accretions that may thereafter form, become\r\n      the property of the riparian proprietor.”\r\n\r\nFollowing is an example of a mining claim with a meander line as a\r\nboundary taken from Mineral Survey 2154A Alaska. While the notes do not\r\nspecifically call for meander corners, they do state that the line\r\nfollows the mean high water mark of Cook Inlet (Figure 2). It is not\r\nnecessary to monument the intermediate angle points along the meander\r\nline, as the example shows.\r\n\r\nShould one entire end of a claim be delineated by a meander line, the\r\nend line will be protracted parallel to the inland end line at the\r\nfarthest seaward point for the purpose of determining extralateral\r\nrights.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              CHAPTER II\r\n                                                  Discovery and Location\r\n\r\n\r\nLode Claims\r\n\r\n=2–1= Discovery: “No lode claim shall be located until after the\r\ndiscovery of a vein or lode within the limits of the claim, the object\r\nof which provision is evidently to prevent the appropriation of presumed\r\nmineral ground for speculative purposes to the exclusion of bona fide\r\nprospectors, before sufficient work has been done to determine whether a\r\nvein or lode really exists.” (43 C.F.R. 3841.3–1) Obviously, then, the\r\nstaking and recording of a claim without a discovery of mineral is to no\r\navail, except that a discovery made prior to intervening rights perfects\r\nthe location. A claimant diligently trying to make a discovery will\r\ngenerally be protected.\r\n\r\nExcept for the minerals covered by the Leasing Act (1920), and common\r\nvarieties which may be acquired under the Materials Act (1947 and 1955),\r\n“Whatever is recognized as a mineral by the standard authorities,\r\nwhether metallic or other substance, when found on public lands in\r\nquantity and quality sufficient to render the lands valuable on account\r\nthereof, is treated as coming within the purview of the mining laws.”\r\n(43 C.F.R. 3812.1)\r\n\r\nWhether a mineral should be located as a lode or placer claim depends on\r\nthe nature of the deposit.\r\n\r\nLodes are deposits of mineral in place, regardless of their origin. The\r\nmineral must be firmly contained or embraced in solid rock. This\r\nincludes veins with distinct hanging and foot walls, replacement\r\ndeposits in sedimentary formations, ancient stream channels now\r\nconsolidated in sandstones, such as the uranium deposits of Wyoming, and\r\ndisseminated deposits such as the copper porphyries of Arizona.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, mechanical deposits of minerals such as gold\r\ncontained in the gravels of stream beds and alluvium deposits are\r\nproperly located as placer claims. However, certain rock types, such as\r\nmarble and perlite while mineral in place, are properly located as\r\nplacers since the Act of 1892 provided for locating building stone under\r\nthe placer mining laws. Included are bedded minerals not contained in\r\nrock in place, such as bentonite.\r\n\r\nThe discovery requirements for a lode claim are that the mineral must be\r\nin place. A discovery of float (a loose piece of ore from a vein) is\r\ninsufficient. Merely a trace of mineral is insufficient. Discovery by\r\ngeologic inference is insufficient. There must be an actual and physical\r\nexposure of a lode.\r\n\r\nThe discovery must be on vacant public domain, which includes patented\r\nsurface lands with minerals reserved to the United States.\r\n\r\nThere have been many court cases and decisions as to what constitutes\r\nthe discovery of a valuable mineral deposit and it can be a difficult\r\nand complicated matter. The general rule is stated in the famous\r\n_Castle_ v. _Womble_ Decision, 19 L.D. 455, 1894: “When minerals have\r\nbeen found and the evidence is of such a character that a person of\r\nordinary prudence would be justified in the further expenditure of his\r\nlabor and means, with a reasonable prospect of success, in developing a\r\nvaluable mine, the requirements of the statute have been met.”\r\n\r\nIn the Jefferson-Montana Copper Mines Co. case, 41 L.D. 320, 1902, it\r\nwas stated that the following elements of discovery are necessary:\r\n\r\n “1. There must be a vein or lode of quartz or other rock in place.\r\n\r\n  2. The quartz or other rock in place must carry gold or some other\r\n       valuable mineral deposit.\r\n\r\n  3. The two preceding elements, when taken together, must be such as to\r\n       warrant a prudent man in the expenditure of his time and money in\r\n       the effort to develop a valuable mine.”\r\n\r\nThe extent of discovery will vary with the situation to be considered\r\nand the type of mineral and deposit. For example, the requirement as\r\nbetween two claimants is far less than that between a claimant and the\r\nUnited States. A mineral of intrinsic value such as gold may well be\r\nconsidered under the rules set forth above, but a more common mineral\r\nwould be further subjected to a test of marketability.\r\n\r\nIn the course of patent proceedings, a mineral examiner of the Bureau of\r\nLand Management, the Forest Service if the claim is in a national forest\r\nor the National Park Service if the claim is in a national park or\r\nmonument, will make a field investigation to determine the validity of\r\nthe claims in question.\r\n\r\nEach location must be shown to be more valuable for minerals than for\r\nany other purpose and the burden of proof rests with the claimant. The\r\nclaimant must be prepared to show the actual physical discovery and\r\nsubstantiate the value through assays, drill logs, etc.\r\n\r\nThe discovery need not be on the surface and may be made underground. In\r\nthe case of blanket (horizontal) veins, the vein may be wider than the\r\nclaim and discovery can be made anywhere within its boundaries. A\r\ndiscovery showing value and/or marketability may be anywhere within the\r\nclaim. The discovery may be on the end line of a claim, but a single\r\ndiscovery cannot support more than one claim.\r\n\r\nA discovery may be lost by the patenting of a junior claim in conflict,\r\nin which case a new discovery is required.\r\n\r\nA claim cut in two by a non-mineral patent requires a discovery on each\r\nportion of the claim.\r\n\r\nA claimant is entitled to possession as against third parties as long as\r\nhe is diligently engaged in trying to make a discovery.\r\n\r\n=2–2= Discovery Work: 43 C.F.R. 3841.3–2 states:\r\n\r\n      “The claimant should, therefore, prior to locating his\r\n      claim, unless the vein can be traced upon the surface, sink\r\n      a shaft or run a tunnel or drift to a sufficient depth\r\n      therein to discovery and develop a mineral-bearing vein,\r\n      lode or crevice; should determine, if possible, the general\r\n      course of such vein in either direction from the point of\r\n      discovery, by which direction he will be governed in marking\r\n      the boundaries of his claim on the surface.”\r\n\r\nExcept for the foregoing, the matter of discovery work is left to State\r\nlaw. The general requirement was that the vein (deposit) be disclosed to\r\na depth of ten feet, or deeper if necessary, in a shaft, cut or tunnel.\r\nIn recent years the tendency is away from requiring discovery work. This\r\nwas brought about largely through the destruction of the surface by\r\nbulldozers digging needless pits or cuts on uranium claims in order to\r\nsatisfy State law.\r\n\r\nDrill holes have also been substituted for the usual shaft, cut or\r\ntunnel. In some cases the filing of maps has been substituted for\r\ndiscovery work.\r\n\r\nThe statutory requirements for each State are given in Chapter I. This\r\nchapter and the statutes themselves should be checked for current\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\nIn any event, a discovery point (usually marked by a discovery monument,\r\nbearing a notice) should be selected by the claimant from which to\r\nrecite the dimensions of his claim. If a discovery is made underground,\r\nthe discovery work requirement is usually met by driving a drift or\r\nraise, or sinking a winze on the vein, for ten feet in length; the\r\ndiscovery point is then marked on the surface, with the dip of the vein,\r\nif any, projected to the surface.\r\n\r\n=2–3= Location: 43 C.F.R. 3841.4–1 states: “From and after May 10, 1872,\r\nany person ... may locate ... a mining claim 1,500 linear feet along\r\nthe ... vein ...; or an association of persons ... may make joint\r\nlocation of such claim of 1,500 feet, but in no event can a location of\r\na vein or lode made after May 10, 1872, exceed 1,500 feet along the\r\ncourse thereof....”\r\n\r\n43 C.F.R. 3841.4–2 states: “No lode located after May 10, 1872 can\r\nexceed a parallelogram 1,500 feet in length by 600 feet in width, but\r\nwhether surface ground of that width can be taken depends upon the local\r\nregulations or State or Territorial laws.... No such local regulations\r\nor State or Territorial laws shall limit a vein or lode claim to less\r\nthan 1,500 feet ... nor can surface rights be limited to less than 50\r\nfeet in width....”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DISCOVERY CUT\r\n\r\n  Excavated by bulldozer, with discovery monument and location notice at\r\n    the point of discovery.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DISCOVERY DRILL HOLE\r\n\r\n  Note the discovery monument in the hole and samples of cuttings taken\r\n    at each 5 feet of depth.\r\n]\r\n\r\n43 C.F.R. 3841.4–3 further states: “With regard to the extent of surface\r\nground ..., the Act of May 10, 1872, provides that the lateral extent of\r\nlocations of veins or lodes ... shall in no case exceed 300 feet on each\r\nside of the middle of the vein at the surface, and that no such surface\r\nrights shall be limited by any mining regulations to less than 25 feet\r\non each side of the middle of the vein at the surface ...; the end lines\r\nof such claims to be in all cases parallel to each other ...; and when\r\nthe locator does not determine by exploration where the middle of the\r\nvein at the surface is, his discovery shaft must be assumed to mark such\r\npoint.”\r\n\r\nThe only State known to limit the width of claims at present is North\r\nDakota which only allows 150 feet on each side of the vein.\r\n\r\nWhile Wyoming allows the full width, the side lines must be equidistant\r\nfrom the discovery, i.e., a claim may not have 300 feet on one side and\r\n200 feet on the other. Since the federal law limits the size to 300 feet\r\non each side of the vein, if 200 feet is taken on one side, 400 cannot\r\nbe taken on the other.\r\n\r\nThe length each way from the point of discovery may be any amount as\r\nlong as the total does not exceed 1,500 feet.\r\n\r\nThere is no limit to the number of claims any individual, association or\r\ncorporation may locate.\r\n\r\nFigure 3 shows three different claim patterns, all of which meet federal\r\nrequirements. Claim A is the usual rectangle with the full length and\r\nwidth, Claim B shows parallel end lines that are not at right angles to\r\nthe lode line and side lines. While they are longer than 600 feet, the\r\nright angle distance on either side of the lode line is exactly 300\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nClaim C shows a break in bearing of the lode line at the center of the\r\nclaim (it could be anywhere on the lode line). Like Claim B, the right\r\nangle width does not exceed 300 feet on either side of the center line\r\nfor any portion of the claim.\r\n\r\nCorners may be placed on patented land and on other claims in order to\r\nobtain the described pattern and achieve parallel end lines with\r\nextralateral rights. If the fee owner objects to monuments, witness\r\ncorners may be used.\r\n\r\n43 C.F.R. 3841.4–4 and 3841.4–5 give the minimum requirements for\r\ndefining and monumenting locations including the recording of location\r\nnotices. The laws of the various states elaborate on these requirements\r\ngiving minimum size of monuments and acceptable materials, specifying\r\nthe points on the boundaries that shall be monumented, giving the\r\ncontents required in the location certificates and setting time limits\r\nfor completing discovery work and recording. (See Chapter I.)\r\n\r\nA wood 4″×4″ post at least four feet in length, well set in the ground,\r\nmakes a good monument. It should be marked on the side facing the claim\r\nwith the corner number and initial, if not the full name of the claim.\r\nSide centers may be marked S/C and end corners E/C, as required.\r\n\r\nDiscovery monuments are usually marked D.M. The markings can be painted,\r\nor scribed with a timber scriber. In a very active area where a number\r\nof claims are being staked, claimants often paint the tops of posts with\r\na distinctive color so that they may be readily identified.\r\n\r\nA simple way to lay out and monument a single claim is to begin at the\r\ndiscovery point and run out the desired distance each way along the lode\r\nline, then turn an angle of 90° and run each way 300 feet to the\r\ncorners. (See Figure 4.)\r\n\r\nA simple way to lay out a block of claims on a bedded deposit is to run\r\nout a common set of end lines and at 300 feet or less turn 90° and at 50\r\nfeet or less set a discovery monument. Continue this procedure until the\r\nend of the area is reached, then complete the survey by running the\r\nboundaries so that each corner is located and monumented. (See Figure\r\n4.)\r\n\r\nIn staking a block of claims it is advisable to make them short of the\r\n600′×1500′ so that minor errors in the location survey will not result\r\nin infractions caused by oversize claims.\r\n\r\nThere is no set rule for numbering corners, clockwise or\r\ncounterclockwise, except that they be consecutive. In a block of claims\r\ncorner numbers should be grouped, reducing the number of ties to a\r\nsection corner or natural object.\r\n\r\nWhile 43 C.F.R. 3841.4–5 calls for a tie to a permanent, well-known\r\npoint or object from the discovery, a tie from one of the corners is\r\nperfectly acceptable. In fact a metes and bounds description with\r\nbearings given at least to degrees and distances in feet, should be\r\nincluded in the location certificate. Avoid using such directions as\r\nsouthwesterly, northeasterly, northerly, etc. Acceptable location\r\ncertificate forms can usually be purchased at a local printer or\r\nstationery store.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 3\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe term “location notice” applies to the notice posted on the claim at\r\nthe time of discovery. Some states require that a copy of this notice be\r\nrecorded, while others provide for the filing of a location certificate\r\nafter all discovery work has been completed and the boundaries\r\nmonumented. Forms for the location notice, to be followed by the\r\nlocation certificate for Colorado, and a form for a California location\r\nnotice, where a copy of the notice is recorded, are included in the\r\nappendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlacer Claims\r\n\r\n=2–4= Discovery: 43 C.F.R. 3842.1–1 states: “But one discovery of\r\nmineral is required to support a placer location, whether it be of 20\r\nacres by an individual, or 160 acres or less by an association of\r\npersons.” The discovery may be anywhere in the claim and must be more\r\nthan a trace. Although it need not be commercial for purposes of\r\nlocation, commercial feasibility (or marketability) will be required for\r\npatent.\r\n\r\nKnown lodes are automatically excluded from placer locations. If any are\r\nknown to exist they must be located as lode claims; the extent of\r\nsurface ground may be the minimum, i.e., 25 ft. on either side of the\r\nvein.\r\n\r\nA number of oil shale placer claims were in existence at the time the\r\nMineral Leasing Act was passed in 1920, and have subsequently been\r\npatented. Many discontinued performing the annual assessment work on the\r\ntheory that no one else could locate the claim. The Department of the\r\nInterior has recently ruled (U.S. v. Frank W. Winnegar et al.; 81 I.D.\r\n370) that failure to develop an oil shale claim demonstrates that the\r\ndeposit is not valuable and that the rule of the prudent man has not\r\nbeen met.\r\n\r\n=2–5= Discovery Work: As with lodes, the State requirements for\r\ndiscovery work have been eliminated for all but the State of Washington.\r\nHowever, sufficient excavation will be necessary to disclose a valuable\r\ndeposit.\r\n\r\n=2–6= Location: The Act of 1870 limited placer claims to 160 acres,\r\nwhether they be located by an individual or association; the Act of 1872\r\nlimited locations to 20 acres per person, with up to 160 acres for an\r\nassociation of eight persons. Therefore, two persons may take 40 acres;\r\nthree take 60 acres; four take 80 acres, etc.\r\n\r\nIf practicable, placer claims shall conform to the legal subdivisions of\r\nthe public land survey, with ten acres being the smallest unit\r\nconsidered. If on unsurveyed lands, a placer claim should conform to the\r\nprotracted survey. If on surveyed lands, no further description is\r\nnecessary and the claim may proceed to patent on this basis. State law\r\nmay require monumentation of the corners.\r\n\r\nIf on unsurveyed lands a mineral survey will be required before\r\napplication for patent can be made. Further limitation on size of\r\nprecious metal placers is imposed by the State of Alaska. There is no\r\nlimit on the number of placer claims that may be located.\r\n\r\nWhere fractional lots of the public land survey are encountered, the\r\nrule of approximation may be applied to excess acreage. The rule is that\r\nthe amount of excess may not exceed the amount of loss, if one of the\r\nsubdivisions were eliminated. On the basis of ten acre tracts, the\r\nallowable excess would be 4.99 acres.\r\n\r\nThere are instances where conformity to the public land survey is not\r\npractical. These instances occur where conformity would take in a\r\nsizable amount of non-mineral ground, such as a gulch placer, where the\r\nclaim is surrounded by prior locations or conformity would necessitate\r\nplacing the lines on prior claims. In these cases, a metes and bounds\r\ndescription is proper, but with the following limitation: A location by\r\none or two persons must be included within a square 40 acre tract; a\r\nlocation by three or four persons within two square 40 acre tracts\r\nplaced end to end; a location by five or six persons within three square\r\n40 acre tracts; seven or eight persons within four square 40 acre\r\ntracts. (43 C.F.R. 3842.1–5)\r\n\r\nRegardless of the manner in which a placer is described, a location\r\nnotice and/or certificate must be posted and filed for record. A sample\r\ncertificate is included in the appendix.\r\n\r\n\r\nMill Sites\r\n\r\n=2–7= Authority: The Act of 1872 provided for five acre mill sites to be\r\ntaken in conjunction with lode claims or for the purpose of building an\r\nore reduction works (mill or smelter). The Act of 1960 further provided\r\nfor mill sites taken in conjunction with placer claims, and further\r\nprovided for the description to be in the same manner as the placer.\r\nThis provided for describing mill sites by legal subdivisions, and in\r\npractice this method of description is extended to mill sites taken with\r\nlodes or for an ore reduction works. (Instruction Memo No. 72–151,\r\n4/25/72.)\r\n\r\nLand appropriated as a mill site must be non-mineral in character and\r\nthe surface open to location under the mining laws. Once patented, it\r\nincludes all minerals. Nominal values do not constitute mineral ground,\r\nnor does the fact that a mill site adjoins a lode or placer claim prove\r\nmineral ground. In patent proceedings, the mineral examiner may require\r\ndrilling to provide the non-mineral character of the land.\r\n\r\nAs with lodes and placers, a location notice must be posted and\r\nrecorded. (See appendix for sample.) State law may require\r\nmonumentation, even if described by legal subdivisions.\r\n\r\n=2–8= Required Use: 43 C.F.R. 3844.1 states: “A omitted is required to\r\nbe used or occupied distinctly and explicitly for mining or milling\r\npurposes in connection with the lode or placer claim with which it is\r\nassociated. A custom or independent mill site may be located for the\r\nerection and maintenance of a quartz mill or reduction works.”\r\n\r\nThere is no limit to the number of mill sites that may be located, so\r\nlong as they are necessary for the operation of a mine or mill.\r\nAcceptable uses include tailings ponds, dumps, storage facilities,\r\nliving quarters, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTunnel Sites\r\n\r\n=2–9= Possessory Right: The Act of 1872 gave the proprietors of a mining\r\ntunnel the possessory right to 1,500 feet of any blind lodes cut by the\r\ntunnel, not previously known to exist, for a distance of 3,000 feet from\r\nthe portal, or first working face of the tunnel. Since the 1,500 feet\r\ncould be taken in either direction from the line of the tunnel, this\r\nprovided an exclusive area 3,000 feet square.\r\n\r\nWhen a lode is discovered in the tunnel, it must be staked on the\r\nsurface, and a notice posted on the surface at the projected point of\r\ndiscovery, either directly above or protracted on the dip of the vein.\r\n\r\nFailure to work the tunnel for six months constitutes abandonment. A\r\ntunnel site may not be patented. (See appendix for sample location\r\ncertificate.)\r\n\r\n=2–10= Location: 43 C.F.R. 3843.2 and 3843.3 provides for posting a\r\nnotice at the portal of the tunnel, staking the claim and recording a\r\ncopy of the notice with the proper local authorities. The Act of 1976\r\nalso requires recording with the Bureau of Land Management.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to stake the line of the tunnel at such intervals so\r\nthat each succeeding stake or monument is visible from the last,\r\nbeginning at the first working face and continuing 3,000 feet to the\r\nend. The four corners of the tunnel site should also be monumented.\r\n\r\nAlthough not expressly provided for by law, a dump site of reasonable\r\nsize may be located at the portal of the tunnel.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\n=2–11= Recording of Claims: 43 C.F.R. 3841.4–6 states: “The location\r\nnotice must be filed for record in all respects as required by State or\r\nTerritorial laws, and local rules and regulations, if there be any.”\r\nAlthough the foregoing is contained in that section pertaining to lode\r\nclaims, the same applies to placer claims, mill sites and tunnel sites.\r\nAll the state laws make provision for the recording of location notices,\r\nwith the County Clerk and Recorder or his equivalent (Register of Deeds\r\nin North and South Dakota, County Auditor in the State of Washington).\r\nShould the claim fall in two counties, it is proper to record the\r\noriginal certificate in the county (and state) where the discovery lies.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 made the recordation\r\nof mining claims with the Bureau of Land Management mandatory. Unlike\r\nstate requirements, failure to file for record with the Bureau of Land\r\nManagement within the designated time makes the claim abandoned and\r\nvoid. The objective is stated in 43 C.F.R. 3833.0–2:\r\n\r\n      “An objective of these regulations is to determine the\r\n      number and location of unpatented mining claims, mill sites\r\n      or tunnel sites located on Federal lands to assist in the\r\n      management of those lands and the mineral resources therein.\r\n      Other objectives are to remove the cloud on the title to\r\n      these lands because they are subject to mining claims that\r\n      may have been abandoned and to keep the BLM abreast of\r\n      transfers of interest in unpatented mining claims, mill site\r\n      and tunnel sites ....”\r\n\r\nAn abstract of the law is given in Chapter I. The proper State office of\r\nthe Bureau of Land Management should be contacted to determine their\r\nrequirements.\r\n\r\n=2–12= Assessment Work (Annual Labor): 43 C.F.R. 3851.1 states:\r\n\r\n      “In order to hold the possessory right to a lode or placer\r\n      location made after May 10, 1872, not less than $100 worth\r\n      of labor must be performed or improvements made thereon\r\n      annually. The period within which the work required to be\r\n      done shall commence at 12 o’clock meridian on the first day\r\n      of September succeeding the date of location of each claim.\r\n      Where a number of contiguous claims are held in common, the\r\n      aggregate expenditure that would be necessary to hold all\r\n      the claims may be made on any one claim. Cornering locations\r\n      are held not to be contiguous.”\r\n\r\nAlmost any type of improvement will count as assessment work.\r\nDevelopment work in the form of shafts, cuts and tunnels definitely will\r\ncount as well as drill holes. Roads, bridges, ore bins, etc., will also\r\ncount. Recently, geological, geochemical and geophysical surveys have\r\nbeen included as qualifying for assessment work, although not for patent\r\nexpenditure.\r\n\r\nReports by qualified experts conducting such surveys must be filed with\r\nthe county recorder. Such work cannot apply to more than two consecutive\r\nyears and no more than a total of five years. Work may be done in a\r\ncommon improvement, but such work must be of benefit to all claims of\r\nthe common group. It may be outside the claims, such as a tunnel driven\r\ntoward the group for the development of the claims at depth. Not all\r\nwork qualifying for annual labor will qualify as patent expenditure.\r\n\r\nProvision is made in state laws for the filing of an affidavit of\r\nassessment work and form of content is provided. A copy of said\r\naffidavit or other proof must also be filed with the Bureau of Land\r\nManagement. In the past, the filing for record of the affidavit shifted\r\nthe burden of proof from the claimant to third parties and failure to\r\nfile such an affidavit, or failure to do the work, did not invalidate\r\nthe claim. Now, failure to do the work and file the necessary proof with\r\nthe Bureau of Land Management will render the claim abandoned and void.\r\n\r\nNotice of intent to hold must be filed with the Bureau of Land\r\nManagement in the case of mill sites and tunnel sites and in the case of\r\nlodes or placers should the annual assessment work be suspended as it\r\nhas in the past during time of war or economic stress.\r\n\r\n=2–13= Relocation, Amended Location, Additional Location Certificate:\r\nThe terms “relocation” and “amended location” when made by the owner are\r\nsynonymous. Generally, there is no relocation or amended location by the\r\nowner unless there is a change on the ground, such as a change in the\r\nboundaries or a change in the discovery. Such relocations or amended\r\nlocations relate back to the original location and no existing rights\r\nare surrendered by such an amendment. If there is no change on the\r\nground, and the change is only in the description, then an additional\r\nlocation certificate will suffice.\r\n\r\nAmendments (or relocations) by the owner are made for the purpose of\r\ncorrecting any errors in the original location, description or record,\r\nchanging the boundaries, or for the purpose of acquiring that part of\r\nany overlapping claim that has been abandoned. A relocation by the owner\r\nwill not cure the lack of discovery or failure to do assessment work.\r\n\r\nIn the case of relocation of an abandoned claim by a third party, the\r\ndiscovery work should be extended or a new discovery made and the\r\nmonuments should be checked to see that all are in place and in good\r\ncondition. Such a relocation does not relate back to the original\r\nlocation.\r\n\r\nState laws cover amendments and relocations and they should be checked\r\nfor the requirements. (See appendix for sample Additional and Amended\r\nLocation Certificate.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             CHAPTER III\r\n                                                       Mineral Surveyors\r\n\r\n\r\nAppointments\r\n\r\n=3–1= 43 C.F.R. 3861.5–1 states:\r\n\r\n      “Pursuant to section 2334 of the Revised Statutes (30 U.S.C.\r\n      39), the Director or his delegate will appoint only a\r\n      sufficient number of surveyors for the survey of mining\r\n      claims to meet the demand for that class of work. Each\r\n      applicant shall qualify as prescribed by the Director or his\r\n      delegate. Applications for appointment may be made at any\r\n      office of the Bureau of Land Management listed in 3821.2–1\r\n      of these regulations. A roster of appointed mineral\r\n      surveyors will be available at these offices. Each appointee\r\n      may execute mineral surveys in any state where mineral\r\n      surveys are authorized.”\r\n\r\nThe Director referred to is the Director, Bureau of Land Management.\r\n\r\n=3–2= Mineral Surveyors were originally appointed by the Surveyors\r\nGeneral (General Land Office) of the various states where mineral\r\nsurveys are authorized, and were appointed for that State only. As a\r\ngeneral rule these men were practicing consulting mining engineers in an\r\narea covering one or more mining districts and seldom went out of their\r\narea to execute surveys. As a result, over a period of time, they\r\ndeveloped a valuable set of survey records pertaining to claim corners,\r\nsection corners and mine workings. Claimants found it advantageous to\r\nemploy a mineral surveyor in his district because of his proximity to\r\nthe work and his previously acquired knowledge.\r\n\r\nWith the decline in mining activity due to mineral deposits being\r\nexhausted or reaching uneconomical depths, and with the improvement in\r\nmodes of transportation, mineral surveyors found themselves covering\r\nlarger areas, and many sought appointments in more than one State. With\r\nthe formation of the Bureau of Land Management and the establishment of\r\nareas or regions, the mineral surveyors’ appointments were extended to\r\nthe area or region embracing their State and all adjoining states to the\r\narea or region, and finally to all states subject to the Federal mining\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n=3–3= Today, mineral surveyors are appointed by the Chief, Division of\r\nCadastral Survey of the Bureau of Land Management at Washington, who\r\nacts for the Director. Application may be made to any State Office or\r\ndirectly to the Washington Office. The application should contain a\r\nbrief resume of the applicant’s experience in land surveying, mining and\r\ngeology and list the states in which he is registered as a land\r\nsurveyor, or as a professional engineer if that state permits certain\r\nclasses of professional engineers to do land surveying. The applicant is\r\ncautioned, however, that appointments are made only if a need is\r\ndemonstrated by one of the State Directors, and he requests that an\r\nexamination be held at his office to supplement the roll of mineral\r\nsurveyors. Appointments are presently for a four-year period.\r\n\r\n=3–4= Mineral surveyors were originally bonded and such bonds were\r\nusually for a four-year period. The renewal of these bonds served to\r\nkeep the roster of mineral surveyors active. Bonds are no longer\r\nrequired, but the mineral surveyor must request renewal of his\r\nappointment 60 days before its expiration. Renewal is based on his\r\nactivity as a mineral surveyor, the quality of his work and the\r\ntimeliness of filing returns of his surveys. If the record shows that he\r\nhas not been actively engaged in executing mineral surveys, he may be\r\ndropped from the rolls. If he allows his appointment to lapse, he will\r\nnot be reinstated or reappointed unless he demonstrates his capability\r\nto make mineral surveys, and there is a need for additional mineral\r\nsurveyors.\r\n\r\n=3–5= A mineral surveyor’s appointment may be revoked at any time for\r\njust cause, among which are: incompetence, gross misconduct, conflict of\r\ninterest, failure to personally execute a survey, failure to prosecute\r\nwork diligently, and failure to file timely returns.\r\n\r\n=3–6= Before the revocation as stated in 3–5 can occur, any outstanding\r\nsurveys or survey orders must be disposed of by completion, cancellation\r\nor by issuing a new order to another mineral surveyor, as mutually\r\nagreed on by all parties.\r\n\r\n\r\nQualification\r\n\r\n=3–7= Although the mineral surveyor, as an employee or officer of the\r\nFederal Government, is not subject to State laws regulating the practice\r\nof land surveying, he will find it advisable to be registered, at least\r\nin his home State, if not in other states where he engages in mineral\r\nland surveying. Actually, he is only exempt from registration when he is\r\nworking under a mineral survey order and as such he is limited to work\r\ncovered by the order. However, the States of California and Nevada\r\nspecifically permit a United States Mineral Surveyor to make a location\r\nsurvey and to make such survey a part of the record. (Public Resources\r\nCode of California, Sec. 2311, and 517.210 R.S. Nevada.) A mineral\r\nsurveyor would probably not be questioned in other states if he is\r\nmaking an amended location survey or field examination prior to the\r\napplication for survey. Often, additional work will be required by the\r\nclaimant and the mineral surveyor will have to refer this work to others\r\nor associate with a registered surveyor. Furthermore, if an applicant\r\nfor appointment is not registered in his home State, the Chief of the\r\nDivision of Cadastral Survey may require a more extensive examination so\r\nas to embrace material normally covered in State examinations.\r\n\r\n=3–8= Although basically a land surveyor, the mineral surveyor should\r\nhave a working knowledge of geology, ore deposits and principles of\r\nmining in order to properly execute his work. He should also be familiar\r\nwith the methods of making underground surveys. He may acquire such\r\nknowledge informally by reading texts on the subjects and through\r\nmembership in local mining associations and organizations.\r\n\r\n=3–9= Applicants for appointment as Mineral Surveyor must pass a 16–hour\r\nexamination with a grade of 70 consisting essentially of four parts:\r\n\r\n1. A solar observation for azimuth consisting of six consecutive\r\nreadings, with an engineer’s transit or double center theodolite, three\r\neach with the telescope in direct and reversed positions observing\r\nopposite limbs of the sun; together with the necessary calculations to\r\ndetermine the true meridian. The applicant will furnish the instrument\r\nused.\r\n\r\n2. Correctly answer questions on the legal and technical aspects of\r\nmineral surveys. Such questions may be of the true/false or multiple\r\nchoice type.\r\n\r\n3. Solve a practical problem relating to mining claims, including\r\nconflicts, where a set of conditions are given.\r\n\r\n4. Prepare a set of field notes and prepare a preliminary plat from\r\ngiven field data.\r\n\r\nReferences and calculators including minicomputers may be used in the\r\nexamination. It is an open book examination.\r\n\r\nThe examination will be held in the office of the State Director who\r\nmade the request, but it is not limited to residents of that State and\r\nanyone whose application has been accepted may take the examination at\r\nhis own expense. Upon successful completion of the examination, the\r\napplicant will furnish the names of three references who are familiar\r\nwith his character, integrity and capability as a surveyor. The\r\nexamination is prepared by the Washington Office and mailed in a sealed\r\nenvelope bearing the applicant’s name to the State office. The completed\r\nexamination is returned to the Washington Office in a sealed envelope\r\nfor each applicant for grading.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuties of the Mineral Surveyor\r\n\r\n=3–10= The duties of the mineral surveyor begin with an order for survey\r\nand cease with the approval of that survey. This precludes using data\r\nacquired by former surveys and by reason of having made the location or\r\namended location survey, unless such data is verified by field work and\r\nexamination after the survey order is issued.\r\n\r\nThe surveyor should not act as agent for the claimant in the signing of\r\nlocation or amended location certificates, although he may post such\r\nnotices for the claimant. _The mineral surveyor is prohibited from\r\ntaking any part in the patent application;_ however, he may assist the\r\nattorney or agent or the claimant himself in interpreting his field\r\nnotes, including the area statement. A mineral surveyor exceeds his\r\nduties if he prepares the notices of application for patent (24 L.D.\r\n193).\r\n\r\n=3–11= The survey must be made in person by the mineral surveyor. This\r\ndoes not mean that every physical act of survey must be performed by\r\nhim, but it must be performed under his direct supervision in the field.\r\nThe mineral surveyor is prohibited from delegating such supervision to\r\nemployees. In other words, the mineral surveyor cannot send a field\r\nparty out to do the work under his authority without being on the ground\r\nhimself. There is no objection to having more than one survey crew\r\nperform the field work as long as the mineral surveyor can give each\r\ncrew adequate supervision. The same rule applies to office work in\r\nconnection with the survey.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing that prohibits a mineral surveyor from being a part of\r\nan engineering and/or surveying firm, but he should be a principal of\r\nthat firm. If he works as an employee of such a firm, he is compromising\r\nhis appointment, for as a mineral surveyor he is an employee of the\r\nBureau of Land Management.\r\n\r\nHe cannot be an employee of the claimant, nor can he employ the\r\nclaimant, his attorney or parties in interest as assistants in making\r\nsurveys of mineral claims (43 C.F.R. 3861.3–2).\r\n\r\n=3–12= The survey must be an actual survey on the ground. This precludes\r\nthe calculation of ties and other lines through prior surveys. (See 6\r\nL.D. 718 which disallowed a section corner tie calculated from another\r\nsurvey and required an amended survey to run the section tie on the\r\nground.)\r\n\r\n=3–13= The mineral surveyor should bear in mind that his field work is\r\nsubject to spot checks by cadastral surveyors of the Bureau of Land\r\nManagement for sufficiency and accuracy; also, if his returns of a\r\nsurvey indicate irregularities, a complete examination by the Bureau of\r\nLand Management may be made. Such field checks will normally be made\r\nwhen a field party is in the area during the normal course of a field\r\nseason. Irregularities that cannot be resolved with the mineral surveyor\r\nmay call for a special field examination.\r\n\r\n\r\nContract for Surveys\r\n\r\n=3–14= 43 C.F.R. 3861.4–1 Payment: (a) The claimant is required in all\r\ncases to make satisfactory arrangements with the surveyor for the\r\npayment for his services and those of his assistants in making the\r\nsurvey, as the United States will not be held responsible for the same.\r\n(b) The State Director has no jurisdiction to settle differences\r\nrelative to the payment of charges for field work between mineral\r\nsurveyors and claimants. These are matters of private contract and must\r\nbe enforced in the ordinary manner, i.e., in the local courts. The\r\nDepartment has, however, authority to investigate charges affecting the\r\nofficial actions of mineral surveyors, and will, on sufficient cause\r\nshown, suspend or revoke their appointment. (See 3–1 above.)\r\n\r\n=3–15= 30 U.S.C. 39 states in part: “The Director of the Bureau of Land\r\nManagement shall also have the power to establish the maximum charges\r\nfor surveys ...; and to the end that the Director may be fully informed\r\non the subject, each applicant (for patent) shall file with the Manager\r\n(of the land office) a sworn statement of all charges and fees paid by\r\nsuch applicant for ... surveys....”\r\n\r\n=3–16= Many factors enter into the ultimate cost of a mineral survey,\r\nsuch as the terrain, distance from centers of population, condition of\r\nthe public land survey, number of conflicts with prior surveys and\r\npatents, the age of conflicting surveys, variable weather conditions,\r\nand inflation.\r\n\r\nCost should be a secondary consideration in selecting a mineral surveyor\r\nand the remuneration should be such as to assure an adequate job. Many\r\nof the early day surveys of the public lands resulted in poor or even\r\nfraudulent work because of the low contract price.\r\n\r\nIf a mineral surveyor has had considerable experience in an area, he may\r\nagree to a fixed price per claim, plus a fixed price per conflict and\r\nper mile of retracement of section lines with subdivision of sections as\r\nrequired. An alternative to this is a daily or hourly fee for each\r\nprincipal or party chief and assistants, plus expenses at cost, which\r\nassures the Bureau of Land Management and the claimant that quality will\r\nnot be sacrificed because of cost. In the latter case, the mineral\r\nsurveyor should provide the claimant with an estimate so that he will be\r\nprepared to meet his invoices. Either type of contract should provide\r\nfor periodic payments, and the mineral surveyor is justified in\r\nrequesting an advance deposit. In any event, payment for the mineral\r\nsurvey is a matter of private contract; the foregoing are merely\r\nsuggestions.\r\n\r\n=3–17= Inasmuch as mineral surveyors may not hold an interest in the\r\npublic domain (see Sec. 3–18 below), they are prohibited from accepting\r\nan interest in the claims as payment for his services.\r\n\r\n\r\nRestrictions\r\n\r\n=3–18= The following is quoted from the current (1977) letter appointing\r\nmineral surveyors:\r\n\r\n      “As a special Government employee (see _Waskey v. Hammer_,\r\n      223 U.S. 85, 1911), you are subject to the pertinent\r\n      conflict of interest statutes and standards of ethical\r\n      conduct as set out in 18 U.S.C. 202 and E.O. 11222, Part\r\n      III. You and your wife are prohibited from acquiring an\r\n      interest in the public lands, either directly or indirectly,\r\n      by provisions of 43 U.S.C. 11 and 43 C.F.R., Part 7. This\r\n      prohibition extends to locating and holding in your names\r\n      any mining claims, oil and gas leases, grazing licenses or\r\n      permits, cadastral survey contracts, or making any other\r\n      application or filing under the public land laws.” 43 C.F.R.\r\n      7.2 defines interest as follows:\r\n\r\n      “The term ‘interest’ means any direct or indirect ownership\r\n      in whole or in part of the lands or resources in question,\r\n      or any participation in the earnings therefrom, or the right\r\n      to occupy or use the property or to take any benefits\r\n      therefrom based on a lease or rental agreement, or upon any\r\n      formal or informal contract with a person who has such an\r\n      interest. It includes membership in a firm, or ownership of\r\n      stock or other securities in a corporation which has such an\r\n      interest: Provided, that stock or securities traded on the\r\n      open market may be purchased by an employee if the\r\n      acquisition thereof will not tend to interfere with the\r\n      proper and impartial performance of the duties of the\r\n      employee or bring discredit upon the Department.”\r\n\r\nEmployees stationed in Alaska are exempt from the above, _except for a\r\nmineral lease or mining claim_, and may acquire one tract of land, not\r\nexceeding five acres, for residence or recreation purposes. [43 C.F.R.\r\n7.4 (a) (1) and (2).] Retention of an interest may be approved upon\r\nwritten request to the Secretary of the Interior, provided the interest\r\nwas acquired prior to becoming an employee or the interest was acquired\r\nby gift, devise, bequest, or by operation of law.\r\n\r\n=3–19= The mineral surveyor may be required to file with the Bureau of\r\nLand Management a “Public Disclosure Statement of Known Financial\r\nInterests” under the Federal Land Policy and Management Act.\r\n\r\n=3–20= It should be clear why the foregoing restrictions are placed on\r\nmineral surveyors. They remove any possible conflict of interest and the\r\nclaimant may deal freely with the mineral surveyor knowing that he\r\ncannot benefit from any information or knowledge gained during the\r\ncourse of the survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              CHAPTER IV\r\n                                        Application and Order for Survey\r\n\r\n\r\n=4–1= Purpose: Except in special instances, such as lands selected by\r\nthe Native Corporations under the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, a\r\nmining claim may be held indefinitely as a location by performing the\r\nannual assessment work and making the necessary affidavits and\r\nrecordings. However, once a valuable mineral deposit has been proven to\r\nexist, it may be desirable to obtain absolute fee title (patent) to the\r\nclaim which, except in special cases, includes not only the mineral\r\nestate, but the surface as well. Patent not only assures possession of\r\nthe property, but will facilitate financing as well.\r\n\r\nUnless the claim is described by legal subdivisions as in the case of\r\nplacers and mill sites, an official survey by a United States Mineral\r\nSurveyor under the direction and with the approval of the Bureau of Land\r\nManagement is the first step in obtaining a patent.\r\n\r\nAlmost universally, the location survey has not been made with\r\nsufficient accuracy or detail to provide the necessary description for\r\npatent. The patent survey will, in addition to permanently monumenting\r\nand witnessing the location on the ground, show all conflicts with prior\r\nmineral surveys, fee lands with mineral rights, and prior locations that\r\nthe claimant wishes to exclude. It will also show all the workings on\r\nthe claims, both by the claimant and by others, if any. The survey\r\nitself confers no rights; patent must follow.\r\n\r\n=4–2= Selecting a Mineral Surveyor: A list of approved and active\r\nmineral surveyors may be obtained from any State Office, or from the\r\nDirector, Bureau of Land Management, at Washington, D.C. Mineral\r\nsurveyors’ appointments cover all states where the mining laws are\r\napplicable.\r\n\r\nUsually, it will be advantageous to select a mineral surveyor close to\r\nthe project, or one who has worked in the area and has a knowledge of\r\nexisting surveys. All mineral surveyors are not equally experienced.\r\nTheir appointment means that they have met certain qualifications and\r\nhave satisfactorily demonstrated a knowledge of mineral survey\r\nprocedures.\r\n\r\nMore than one mineral surveyor should be consulted before making a\r\nselection. His proposed method of making the survey, his availability\r\nand time schedule, as well as fees should be discussed. Fees should be a\r\nsecondary consideration and may be on a time and expense basis or a flat\r\ncontract price. If a flat price is to be decided, the mineral surveyor\r\nwill probably want to first make an examination of the property. In any\r\nevent, the arrangement between the mineral surveyor and the claimant is\r\na matter of private contract, and the Bureau of Land Management will not\r\nbe responsible.\r\n\r\nEven after a survey has been started, the claimant may discharge a\r\nmineral surveyor and select another, but such action will call for an\r\namended order for survey.\r\n\r\n=4–3= Selecting an Attorney: An attorney-at-law to act as agent for the\r\nclaimant in the patent proceedings is not necessary; the claimant can\r\nmake the application for patent himself.\r\n\r\nHowever, an attorney well-versed in mining law can be a big asset and\r\narrangements should be made prior to the survey so that he will be\r\navailable for consultation. The mineral surveyor will know of attorneys\r\nwith whom he has previously worked and may be able to make\r\nrecommendations. The attorney’s fee may be negotiated. If the claimant\r\nis a large corporation, it may have staff attorneys or landmen that can\r\nhandle the patent application.\r\n\r\nThe mineral surveyor may not assist in the patent proceedings. His help\r\nmay be required in determining the net area of the claim from the area\r\nstatement in the mineral surveyor’s field notes. There is no objection\r\nto the mineral surveyor interpreting his notes, and assisting in this\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n=4–4= Application for Survey: Must be made by claimant(s) or his agent\r\non current Form 3860–5 (see appendix). Instructions are on the back of\r\nthe form.\r\n\r\n1. The name of the applicant (claimant) should be given exactly as it is\r\nto appear in the patent, together with his post office address.\r\n\r\n2. Group name (if any). If the claims are known by a group name, it may\r\nbe placed here. If they do not have a group name, it may be omitted.\r\n\r\n3. Name(s) of claim(s) should appear exactly as they are given in the\r\nlocation certificate, e.g., Molly No. 1 should not be given as Molly #1.\r\nThe date the claim was first located and recorded in the present chain\r\nof title must be given; the dates of amendment are only the last\r\namendment made.\r\n\r\n4. The location of the claims by section, township and range (stating\r\nthat it is unsurveyed if based on protracted survey lines), county and\r\nstate must be given. If not within a national forest, “None” should be\r\nused in the blank provided.\r\n\r\n5a. To support the application, furnish two copies of the location\r\nnotice (or last amended location with the original location and\r\nrecordation date shown thereon). One copy must be certified by the\r\ncustodian of the records where mining claims are locally recorded\r\n(usually the County Clerk and Recorder).\r\n\r\n5b. The claim must be monumented on the ground so that the mineral\r\nsurveyor can identify it.\r\n\r\n6. In accordance with the instructions, a deposit in the proper amount\r\nmust be made to cover the costs of the Bureau of Land Management in\r\nprocessing the survey.\r\n\r\n7. The mineral surveyor designated must be one with whom prior\r\narrangements have been made for the survey. The Bureau of Land\r\nManagement may request proof, in the form of a simple letter from the\r\nmineral surveyor, that he has agreed to make the survey. The application\r\nshould then be dated and signed by the applicant(s), if a corporation by\r\nthe authorized officer, or by the Attorney-in-fact if by an agent acting\r\nfor the applicant. Proof of authorized signature will not be required by\r\nthe Bureau of Land Management at this time, but will be required at the\r\ntime application for patent is made.\r\n\r\nSeveral claims, generally limited to 50 in number, may be embraced in a\r\nsingle survey provided they are contiguous, i.e., not merely cornering;\r\nthey must adjoin with common boundaries or overlap. Limiting the number\r\nof claims to be embraced in a single survey is arbitrary, but set at\r\napproximately 50 in order to facilitate processing. Two groups of claims\r\nmay be embraced in a single survey if they both adjoin a group\r\npreviously surveyed for patent and are owned in common.\r\n\r\nOccasions have arisen where the group of claims lies in two states.\r\nApplications for survey should be made in each state for the claims or\r\nportions thereof which lie in that state. A survey number will be\r\nassigned in each state for the portion lying within each state, but the\r\nsurvey will be assigned for processing to the State where the majority\r\nof the claims lie. (See Surs. Nos. 10631 Montana, 3168 Idaho.)\r\n\r\n=4–5= Records Search: Prior to applying for the mineral survey, the\r\nclaimant or his agent should make a search of the county records to\r\ndetermine if the claims are in conflict with other mining claim\r\nlocations. If so, copies of the location certificates should be obtained\r\nfor the mineral surveyor. If the claims are prior valid locations and\r\nthe claimant wishes to exclude them from his patent application, the\r\nmineral surveyor will be required to show the conflict as it exists on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nIf it is not the desire to exclude such claims, no mention of them will\r\nbe made in the field notes of the mineral survey, but the mineral\r\nsurveyor will be aware of them when he goes on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe claimant should also make a search of the Bureau of Land Management\r\nrecords, particularly the Master Title Plats (M.T. Plats) to determine\r\nconflict with prior patents and withdrawals. Connecting sheets, if\r\navailable, which show in outline all approved mineral surveys, should\r\nalso be examined for conflicts with prior mineral surveys. The BLM\r\nrecord of unsurveyed locations should also be searched.\r\n\r\nThe claimant should make certain that his discovery point is on vacant\r\npublic domain, which includes minerals reserved to the United States\r\nwhere the patent is for the surface only.\r\n\r\nIf two or more claims are involved, each must have its own discovery and\r\nboth discoveries may not be in an area of conflict between two claims.\r\n\r\nThe length and width of each lode claim must be checked to make certain\r\nthat statutory length of 1500 feet has not been exceeded and that the\r\nright angle distance of no more than 300 feet exists on each side of the\r\npresumed course of the vein (lode line).\r\n\r\nThe acreage of all claims and the length of placers must be checked for\r\nexcess. If excesses appear to exist the mineral surveyor should be\r\nadvised of them and directed to survey the claim within the boundaries\r\ngiven so as to eliminate such excess.\r\n\r\nWhile metes and bounds descriptions of lode claims are not mandatory,\r\nthe description must be such that the locus of the claim can be\r\ndetermined. While a tie to a section is preferable, a tie to another\r\nmineral survey, mineral location monument, or triangulation station of\r\nthe National Geodetic Survey or U.S. Geological Survey is acceptable\r\nprovided they can be identified with the public land survey. Ties to\r\nbench marks are not acceptable.\r\n\r\nIrregular claims, such as placer claims or mill sites, must have a metes\r\nand bounds description closing within 0.50 feet in 1,000 feet. The\r\nacreage of lode claims cannot exceed 20.661 acres. Placers may not\r\nexceed 20 acres to each claimant, exclusive of conflict, and mill sites\r\nmay not exceed 5 acres, exclusive of conflict.\r\n\r\nOne of the location certificate copies must be certified by the\r\ncustodian of the local records, usually the County Clerk and Recorder.\r\n\r\nIf any of the above items are not in order, it will be necessary to\r\nrequire the claimant to file an amended location certificate that will\r\nproperly describe the claim. If the error in the certificate is small,\r\nor there is an obvious clerical error, such as calling for a bearing of\r\nN.——W. when it should be N.——E. it will suffice to state in the final\r\nfield notes that the location certificate is in error.\r\n\r\nTo aid in determining the locus and relative position of several claims,\r\nthe claimant may be called upon to furnish a diagram. If the certificate\r\nis marginal in detail, it is proper to suggest to the mineral surveyor\r\nthat an amended location certificate be filed and an amended order for\r\nsurvey obtained before completing his survey. It is also proper to set a\r\ntime limit for the completion of the survey and filing returns.\r\n\r\nAfter receipt of the survey order, the Mineral Surveyor should obtain\r\ncopies of necessary survey records, including MT Plat, the notes of\r\ntownship surveys, conflicting mineral surveys, including the reports as\r\nto the condition of corners and survey discrepancies contained under\r\nother corner descriptions and supplemental data, Homestead Entry Surveys\r\nand Exchange Surveys on Forest Service lands, Small Claims, Homesites,\r\nTrade and Manufacturing Sites, Rights-of-Way and Townsites. He should\r\nalso consult the State and County records for restored section corners\r\nand subdivision of sections. A visit with the County Surveyor will often\r\nprove profitable.\r\n\r\n=4–6= Order for Survey: The order for survey is issued by the State\r\nDirector of the Bureau of Land Management or he may delegate this action\r\nto the Chief, Branch of Cadastral Surveys.\r\n\r\nThe order for survey is issued on current Form 3860–6, (see appendix) or\r\nmay be in letter form. The information given is essentially the same as\r\ncontained in the application for survey. The names of the locations must\r\nbe exactly as given in the location certificates.\r\n\r\nThe next consecutive survey number is assigned; a number from a\r\ncancelled survey or survey order should not be used. Lodes and placers\r\nmay be included in the same survey. If a mill site is included, it is\r\ndesignated by adding the letter “B” to the survey number; the other\r\nclaims being designated “A.”\r\n\r\nA copy of the location certificates should be furnished to the mineral\r\nsurveyor, and a copy of the order to the claimant; also to the Regional\r\nForester if the claims are within a National Forest, or the National\r\nPark Service if within a National Park or Monument.\r\n\r\n=4–7= Amended (or Supplemental) Order for Survey: An amended order is\r\nbased on an amended application from the claimant. It is usually\r\noccasioned by the filing of amended location certificates. The amended\r\napplication is processed exactly the same as the original application.\r\n\r\nAn amended order is also called for if there is an addition or deletion\r\nof claims from the survey.\r\n\r\nA change in mineral surveyor will call for an amended order, but the\r\norder to the original mineral surveyor must be cancelled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT SECTION CORNER\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NATIONAL GEODETIC SURVEY TRIANGULATION STATION\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf the claimant sells the claims, an amended order will be required to\r\nshow the new claimant.\r\n\r\nAn amended order may be used to authorize the survey of additional\r\nexpenditures if the survey was approved without $500 of expenditures\r\nbeing made. (See Sec. 5–21)\r\n\r\n=4–8= Cancellation of the Survey Order: The most common reason for\r\ncancelling a survey order is failure of the mineral surveyor to complete\r\nthe survey and file his returns. Under these circumstances, both the\r\nclaimant and the mineral surveyor should be advised 30 days in advance\r\nof the action and be requested to show why the order should not be\r\ncancelled. If any reasonable explanation is given, the time should be\r\nextended. Lacking reasonable explanation the order will be cancelled,\r\nnotifying both the claimant and the mineral surveyor, and any excess\r\ndeposit is returned to the claimant.\r\n\r\nOther reasons for cancelling a survey are a request to do so by the\r\nclaimant, or if the claim has been declared null and void due to a\r\ncontest brought by the United States.\r\n\r\nThe mineral survey number of a cancelled survey will not be used again,\r\nunless reopened as an amended survey and would then be shown with an\r\n“Am.” following the mineral survey number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                               CHAPTER V\r\n                                                       The Patent Survey\r\n\r\n\r\nField Work\r\n\r\n=5–1= Preliminary: The first step in the field work should be an\r\nexamination of the property with the claimant or his representative,\r\nunless such an examination was made prior to contracting for the survey.\r\nA sufficient number of claim corners should be visited to determine the\r\nmaterial used, their condition, manner of marking, etc. In the course of\r\nsuch an examination, the claimant should point out known section\r\ncorners, location monuments and triangulation stations, both of the U.S.\r\nGeological Survey and the National Geodetic Survey. The claimant may\r\nalso be able to identify corners of adjoining and conflicting surveys\r\nand locations. If the property is extensive, the claimant may have\r\nestablished his own triangulation network and coordinate system, and if\r\nso, it should be incorporated into the survey, although not necessarily\r\nmade a part of the official record.\r\n\r\nAll the discovery workings should be visited, the discovery points and\r\ndiscovery monuments pointed out. Other workings should be visited and\r\nthe safety of old underground workings discussed. Maps of underground\r\nworkings may be available. Workings constructed by third parties should\r\nalso be identified.\r\n\r\nRelations with landowners and other claimants in the area may be\r\nestablished with the help of the claimant. In addition to gaining access\r\nto the property and to their property for the purpose of executing the\r\nsurvey, they may have helpful information as to the location of section\r\ncorners and the origin of fences.\r\n\r\nIf access is refused, it may be necessary to obtain help from the U.S.\r\nMarshall, but if properly handled in advance of the field work, the\r\nnecessary permission will usually be granted. The fact may be stressed\r\nthat you are a government official and that your work will be impartial.\r\nEmphasize that as a qualified surveyor, you are bound to protect all\r\nvalid interests, property rights, and evidence.\r\n\r\nCopies of the claimant’s maps of the property showing the claim\r\nboundaries, discovery and other workings and access roads should be\r\nobtained from the claimant. The claimant may also have aerial photos\r\nwhich will be helpful in planning the survey.\r\n\r\nDescriptions of all triangulation stations should be obtained. The plat\r\nand field note record of all prior mineral surveys in conflict or\r\nadjoining, as well as a copy of the connected sheet should be ordered,\r\nif not previously furnished with the survey order. The county records\r\npertaining to surveys and particularly the restoration of section\r\ncorners should be searched. The county surveyor may be helpful.\r\n\r\nIf the field examination reveals that there are insufficient location\r\ncorners on the ground to identify the claims, an amended location survey\r\nwith the resulting amended location certificates and request for an\r\namended order for survey will be necessary.\r\n\r\n=5–2= Survey Methods: The preliminary field examination will suggest the\r\nbest method of survey. This will be dictated largely by the nature of\r\nthe terrain and the amount of timber and brush. Modern methods employing\r\ntheodolites and electronic distance measuring equipment should be used.\r\nRegardless of the method used, the work must be sufficiently checked to\r\nassure that errors will be avoided. Most errors occur when adjusting\r\ncorners to their final position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EXECUTING A MINERAL PATENT SURVEY\r\n\r\n  (Transit and Tape Method)\r\n]\r\n\r\n=5–3= Executing the Survey: The survey is usually initiated by retracing\r\nthe boundaries of the location, or tying-in the corners, along with the\r\ndiscovery monuments and discovery points. Readily identified corners of\r\nconflicting surveys and section corners should also be tied in. The\r\nrelative positions of the corners and discovery points are then\r\ndetermined by calculated bearings and distances. If the boundaries are\r\nwithin the statutory length and width (1500 x 600 ft.), the end lines\r\nare parallel and the sidelines are within 300 feet on either side of the\r\ndiscovery point, the survey may proceed.\r\n\r\nIf only small corner moves of a foot or so will make the claim conform,\r\nan amendment is hardly necessary; otherwise, the corners should be moved\r\nand amended location certificates filed.\r\n\r\nA single claim may be surveyed within the location boundaries, without\r\namendment, as long as the above conditions are met.\r\n\r\nNew discoveries may be necessary, but if intervening rights are\r\nsuspected, it is better to hold to the original discovery points and\r\nstake fractional claims as required.\r\n\r\nIf the deposit is a blanket vein or massive deposit, the discovery may\r\nbe anywhere within the claim, except in Wyoming where State law requires\r\nthat the side lines be equidistant from the discovery.\r\n\r\nIf no public land survey corners or location monuments (or other\r\nhorizontal control stations) can be found within two miles of the survey\r\nit will be necessary to establish a location monument. The requirements\r\nare given in Sections 10–32, 33 and 34 of the Manual of Surveying\r\nInstructions. There was a period when these monuments were called\r\n“Mineral Monuments” and were designated “U.S.M.M.”\r\n\r\nConflicts with prior mineral surveys must be determined. It is necessary\r\nto search for each corner controlling a line in conflict. One corner is\r\ninsufficient if others can be found. If the necessary corners cannot be\r\nfound the boundaries shall be reestablished (not remonumented since the\r\nproperty belongs to another party) in accordance with the methods set\r\nforth in Chapter VI.\r\n\r\nConflicts with unsurveyed locations are not to be shown unless it is the\r\nwish of the claimant to exclude them from his patent. If they are prior\r\nlocations, it may be well to do this in order to avoid an adverse suit.\r\nConflicts with unsurveyed locations owned by the claimant and not a part\r\nof the survey need not be shown and excluded unless the area of conflict\r\ncontains the discovery of the unsurveyed location. In cases where two\r\nclaims of the survey are in conflict, the discovery of each claim may\r\nnot be within the area of conflict. If so, an amended location is\r\nnecessary to show a new discovery for one of the claims, outside the\r\narea of conflict.\r\n\r\nIf fee lands with mineral rights are in conflict, a subdivision of the\r\nsection(s) may be necessary. This will depend on the wishes of the\r\nclaimant and the Bureau of Land Management. An extensive resurvey that\r\nwould place a hardship on the claimant should not be required. If a\r\nsubdivision can readily be accomplished, it should be done.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to fix the boundaries of stock-raising homesteads\r\nsince the minerals are reserved to the United States and belong to the\r\nmining claim in areas of conflict.\r\n\r\nSpecial surveys such as townsites, Homestead Entry Surveys, U.S. Surveys\r\nand Coal Surveys in Alaska are treated as are prior mineral surveys.\r\nRights-of-way should not be shown as the minerals are reserved, and when\r\nthe right-of-way is abandoned, the surface reverts to the mining claim.\r\nIn Alaska, native graves must be tied-in. Cemeteries should be shown.\r\n\r\nFigure 5 shows Sur. Nos. 1234 A lode and 1235 B lode in conflict with\r\nthe XYZ lode that is being surveyed for patent. Cors. Nos. 1 and 4 of\r\nSur. No. 1234 A lode control the line of conflict with that claim. If\r\nthey can be found, no further search is necessary; if they cannot, the\r\nsearch must be continued for Cors. Nos. 2 and 3. In the case of Sur. No.\r\n1235, all four corners are required to be found in order to properly\r\nshow the conflict.\r\n\r\nFigure 6 shows the ABC and XYZ lodes, both of which are being surveyed\r\nfor patent under the same survey order. The discovery shafts of both\r\nclaims are in the area of conflict. In order to validate the claims, a\r\nnew discovery must be shown for one of them, outside the conflict. It\r\nneed not be the later claim as the owner has the right to decide which\r\nclaim shall exclude the conflict.\r\n\r\nIf amended location certificates are filed for record, it will be\r\nnecessary to make an amended application for survey to the Bureau of\r\nLand Management based on the amended certificates, and receive an\r\namended order for survey. It will not be necessary to suspend field work\r\npending such amendment, but it is advisable to refrain from marking the\r\ncorners and accessories with the survey number until the amended order\r\nis received.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MINERAL PATENT SURVEY CORNERS\r\n\r\n  Top: a copper coated steel pin with brass cap. The location monument\r\n    is set alongside.\r\n\r\n  Bottom: a stone corner chiseled with the corner number, the initial of\r\n    the claim and the survey number.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6\r\n]\r\n\r\n=5–4= Monumenting the Survey: Section 10–35 of the Manual of Surveying\r\nInstructions, 1973 lists corner monuments in their order of preference.\r\n\r\nAccessories to the corner generally consist of bearing trees or bearing\r\nrocks. If trees are available, two different species at approximately\r\nright angles from each other to the corner should, if possible, be\r\nselected and marked differently so that each can be readily identified.\r\nFor example: one might be a Douglas Fir, 10 inches diameter, bears N.\r\n10° E., 20.65 feet dist., blazed and scribed 1 W—2826 X BT; the other a\r\nPonderosa Pine, 7 inches diameter, bears S. 70° E., 12.52 feet dist.,\r\nblazed and marked X BT. In each case the measurement should be taken to\r\nthe X which is in contrast to the bearing trees to section corners, the\r\nmeasurement being taken to the center of the trees. If the measurement\r\nis to the center of the tree, an X should not be included in the\r\nmarkings.\r\n\r\nThe difference between a pine, spruce and fir can be identified by the\r\nneedles, the pine having needles in bundles, the spruce having needles\r\nsquare in cross section, and the fir having flat needles.\r\n\r\nBearing rocks should be marked X B O or X B R with the measurement taken\r\nto the X; the rock or outcrop being of sufficient size to be readily\r\nidentifiable.\r\n\r\nTies along claim boundaries to items of planimetry and drainage\r\nsurrounding the corner may be taken at this time. Ties to section\r\ncorners, location monuments and triangulation stations may also be made\r\nat this time if they are close to a corner.\r\n\r\nThere is no objection to monumenting corners that fall on patented land.\r\nIf they fall in a cultivated field they should be buried at least one\r\nfoot in the ground. If the landowner objects, a witness corner may be\r\nset. Witness corners should also be set if the corner falls at an\r\ninaccessible point (see Section 4–17 of the Manual of Surveying\r\nInstructions). If the corner falls in a road, it is advisable to bury\r\nthe corner at the true point and set reference monuments at equal\r\ndistances on either side of the road (see Section 4–16 of the Manual of\r\nSurveying Instructions).\r\n\r\nLocation posts, such as a 4×4 post in good condition, may be set\r\nalongside the patent survey corners as a guard post and to aid in\r\ncalling attention to it.\r\n\r\nIn selecting corner numbers, there is no rule other than Cor. No. 1\r\nshould be the corner from which the tie is given to the section corner\r\nor location monument. When surveying a block of claims common corners\r\nshould be given the same number thereby reducing the number of section\r\ncorner ties required from Cor. No. 1. This facilitates field note\r\nwriting as well as platting.\r\n\r\n=5–5= Improvements: All improvements made by the claimant or his\r\ngrantors are to be tied to a corner of the survey, measured, and a value\r\nplaced thereon if they are such as to count toward the $500 patent\r\nexpenditure. If they are to count as patent expenditure, they must be in\r\nthe nature of actual mining improvements, such as cuts, tunnels, shafts,\r\ndrill holes, etc.; in other words, an improvement that tends to develop\r\nor explore the mineral deposit.\r\n\r\nImprovements such as cabins, ore bins, roads, bridges, etc., do not\r\ndevelop the claim, but should be tied in, measured and included under\r\n“OTHER IMPROVEMENTS” in the field notes, without a value.\r\n\r\nWork done by third parties must also be tied-in and listed under “OTHER\r\nIMPROVEMENTS.” If the claimant to such work is unknown, that fact should\r\nbe stated. Again, no value is to be placed on these improvements.\r\n\r\nThe value to be placed on small improvements can readily be ascertained\r\nby multiplying the local wage or cost of equipment and operator by the\r\nlength of time required to do the work. Drill holes may be valued at the\r\ncost of drilling, plus the cost of surveying, geologic evaluation and\r\nassaying. Larger improvements may not be as easy to estimate, and it may\r\nbe necessary to go to the claimant’s cost records in order to place a\r\nreasonable value on them.\r\n\r\nCommon improvements require special consideration. See Sections 10–55,\r\n10–56, and 10–57 of the Manual of Surveying Instructions. A common\r\nimprovement is one that tends to benefit several claims of a common\r\ngroup. It must have been constructed in its entirety subsequent to the\r\nlocation of each claim of the group, or at least $500 must have been\r\nspent on the improvement subsequent to the location of each claim of the\r\ncommon group. All claims within range of benefit must be included, even\r\nthough they were previously surveyed, or if they are locations which are\r\nnot included in the survey. The field notes must recite all the claims\r\ninvolved, whether previously surveyed or unsurveyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OPEN PIT MINES\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AN ACCESS ROAD IN RUGGED AREA. SUCH ROADS DO NOT AS A RULE COUNT\r\n    TOWARD PATENT EXPENDITURE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  AN ADIT (TUNNEL) LEADING TO EXTENSIVE UNDERGROUND WORKINGS\r\n]\r\n\r\nImprovements need not be surveyed with the same accuracy as the claim\r\nboundaries. Stadia measurements are acceptable, although they should be\r\nmade with a Philadelphia Rod and distances kept under 500 feet. Small\r\nworkings may be measured with a Brunton Compass and steel tape, but some\r\npoint of the working, such as the mouth of a tunnel or cut, must be tied\r\nto a corner of the survey using a transit.\r\n\r\nSurveys of extensive underground workings may be taken from the\r\nclaimant’s records if such surveys were executed under the supervision\r\nof a mining engineer.\r\n\r\nExtreme care should be exercised in entering old workings. In addition\r\nto unsafe timbering, they may be poorly ventilated resulting in bad air\r\nthat could be fatal. Rather than risk an accident, the extent of such\r\nworkings can be estimated from the size of the dump.\r\n\r\nTies to discovery workings require special mention in view of the\r\ndirective from the Assistant Director of Technical Services, Washington,\r\nD.C., dated March 15, 1978.\r\n\r\nNormally the discovery working is on the lode or intersects it and a tie\r\nis given along the lode line to the point of discovery, such as the face\r\nof the discovery cut, the mouth of the discovery tunnel, the center of\r\nthe discovery shaft, etc.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the case of blanket veins that are essentially horizontal a\r\npresumed lode line or center line need not be shown, and the discovery\r\nworking may be anywhere on the claim. In such cases, the tie may be\r\ngiven from the nearest corner of the survey and included in the\r\ndescription of that corner, or a right angle tie may be given from a\r\npoint on the nearest end line.\r\n\r\nWhere a discovery has been made by a hole drilled on an angle, a bearing\r\nand distance will be given from the collar of the drill hole to the\r\npoint where it intersects the orebody, the collar of the hole will in\r\nturn be tied to the section corner or location monument. The description\r\nof the hole will necessarily include the verticle angle and the slope\r\ndistance. This does not apply to Wyoming where State law requires that\r\nthe discovery be on the center line.\r\n\r\n=5–6= Placer Claims: Placer claims that do not conform to the legal\r\nsubdivisions of the public land survey will require a patent survey.\r\nWhen such claims are on unsurveyed land they should be conformed as\r\nnearly as possible to the protracted survey.\r\n\r\nIf the claims consist of a gulch placer they must be contained within\r\nthe required number of 40 acre tracts according to the number of\r\nlocators.\r\n\r\nMetes and bounds placers are also permissible where conflicts with other\r\nmining claims would result if a description by legal subdivisions was\r\nused. In such cases, the placer claim must be surveyed around existing\r\nclaims, so that no conflict exists.\r\n\r\nThe field notes of a placer claim must also contain a descriptive report\r\nas called for in the Code of Federal Regulations, 3863.1–3(c). The\r\ninformation required in the descriptive report was omitted from the 1973\r\nManual of Surveying Instructions but was contained in the 1947 manual as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n      “The mineral surveyor is required to make a full examination\r\n      of all placer claims at the time of survey ... and to file\r\n      with his field notes a descriptive report ... duly\r\n      corroborated by one or more disinterested persons and\r\n      covering the following items:\r\n\r\n      (a) The quality and composition of the soil, the kind and\r\n      amount of timber and other vegetation;\r\n\r\n      (b) The location and size of streams, and such other matter\r\n      as may appear upon the surface of the claims;\r\n\r\n      (c) The character, extent, and position of all surface and\r\n      underground workings for mining purposes;\r\n\r\n      (d) The proximity of centers of trade or residence;\r\n\r\n      (e) The proximity of well-known systems of lode deposits or\r\n      of individual lodes;\r\n\r\n      (f) The use or adaptability of the claim for placer mining,\r\n      including the availability of water in sufficient quantity\r\n      for practical operations;\r\n\r\n      (g) Works or expenditures made by the claimant or his\r\n      grantors for the development of the claim; and,\r\n\r\n      (h) The true position of all known mines, salt licks and\r\n      salt springs, and mill sites. When none is known to exist on\r\n      the claim, the fact will be so stated.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A URANIUM MILL\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A URANIUM TAILINGS OR EVAPORATION POND\r\n]\r\n\r\n=5–7= Mill Sites: Modern day mining and milling require sizable areas\r\nfor waste storage, tailings and evaporation ponds. Camp sites, including\r\nschools, may be required for personnel employed at the mine or mill.\r\nSuch areas are properly taken as mill sites and a large number may be\r\nrequired. They may be taken by legal subdivisions but often are\r\nsurveyed, either with lode or placer claims or separately. If they are\r\nincluded in a survey with lodes or placers the survey number includes\r\nthe letter “B”, while the other claims are designated “A”.\r\n\r\nA mill site is not a valid location until it is put in use; therefore,\r\nall improvements and projected improvements should be shown. If the\r\nground is to be used for a tailings or evaporation pond, the dam should\r\nbe shown with its ultimate height and the high water line of the pond\r\ndelineated by the survey.\r\n\r\nIt is also important to demonstrate the non-mineral character of the\r\nland. In the case of adjoining blanket deposits such as uranium, a few\r\nscattered drill holes will show the absence of a mineral deposit.\r\n\r\n\r\nOffice Work\r\n\r\n=5–8= Calculation: The first step will be to reduce coordinate positions\r\nto direct ties, starting with the section corner ties, followed by short\r\nties between claims of the survey should these claims actually overlap.\r\nIn selecting the corners to tie, the tie between corners should be given\r\nthat will facilitate the calculation of intersections and areas by\r\nsolving triangles.\r\n\r\nAs illustrated by Figure 6, claims ABC and XYZ are in the same survey. A\r\ntie should be given from Cor. No. 1 of claim ABC to Cor. No. 2 of claim\r\nXYZ; not between Corners 1 and 3. After these ties have been calculated,\r\nthey should be checked by calculating closures using the various short\r\nties and section corner ties.\r\n\r\nIn selecting corners of conflicting surveys to give tie to, the corner\r\nwithin the survey as illustrated in Figure 5 should be selected. The tie\r\nto Sur. No. 1235 B lode should be to Cor. No. 1 from Cor. No. 1 of the\r\nXYZ lode, or to Cor. No. 2 from Cor. No. 4.\r\n\r\nLines of prior mineral surveys between recovered corners should be\r\nreported as correct or substantially correct as approved. If found in\r\nerror the correct bearing and distance should be given.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 5, if Cors. Nos. 1, 2 and 4 of Sur. No. 1235 B lode were\r\nrecovered, lines 1–2 and 4–1 should be reported. Lines 2–3 and 3–4\r\ncannot be reported since Cor. No. 3 was not found. If the tie from Cor.\r\nNo. 1 is to the same section corner as used in the survey of claim XYZ,\r\nthen the correctness of the tie should be reported. If Cor. No. 1 was\r\nnot recovered, the section corner tie cannot be reported.\r\n\r\nThe position of missing corners should be fixed in accordance with\r\nChapter VI. The remaining lines can then be reported as fixed by the\r\nselected method of restoration.\r\n\r\nIntersections and areas of conflict should then be calculated by solving\r\ntriangles. Areas may be calculated using double meridian distances, but\r\nintersections should never be calculated by forcing a closure.\r\nIntersections may be checked by closure.\r\n\r\nA special situation exists where a former survey excluded an unsurveyed\r\nlocation from the patent and the unsurveyed location has subsequently\r\nbeen abandoned. This area is designated as a tract and its boundaries\r\nare determined from the prior survey. See Tract A of the Jim Dandy Lode\r\ndescribed in the specimen field notes and plat of the Manual of\r\nSurveying Instructions.\r\n\r\nAnother use of a tract is for the purpose of excluding a small area\r\nsurrounding the discovery of another location not embraced in the\r\nsurvey.\r\n\r\nIntersections and areas of conflict with patented lands containing\r\nmineral rights must also be calculated.\r\n\r\nSupporting calculation sheets need not be furnished the Bureau of Land\r\nManagement but computer tapes, if available, will be helpful. The BLM\r\ncan perform the necessary checks by computer.\r\n\r\n=5–9= Preliminary Plat: The mineral surveyor will find it advantageous\r\nto prepare preliminary plats prior to writing the field notes. One plat\r\nshould provide the base and give all the details of the survey with\r\nitems of topography and culture secondary. This plat may be prepared in\r\npencil or ink at the option of the mineral surveyor. It should be such\r\nthat legible blue lines copies can be furnished to the Bureau of Land\r\nManagement along with the notes, and to the claimant. It should clearly\r\nstate that it is a PRELIMINARY PLAT SUBJECT TO CORRECTION. Some offices\r\nof the Bureau of Land Management may request a reproducible copy.\r\n\r\nPlats on linen are no longer required. A secondary plat showing the\r\ntopography and culture in detail will be an aid in writing field notes,\r\nbut is not required by the BLM.\r\n\r\nIf drill holes are part of the improvements and are too numerous to show\r\non the base plat, a separate plat is advisable.\r\n\r\n=5–10= Field Notes: A detailed set of specimen field notes is contained\r\nin the Manual of Surveying Instructions which should be followed for\r\nform and content. There are, however, some inconsistencies: The title\r\npage shown in the manual should not be used. Use current Form 3400–11,\r\nas supplied by the Bureau of Land Management.\r\n\r\nThe locations should be listed in the same order that they are described\r\nin the field notes, thereby serving as an index.\r\n\r\nThe field notes begin with a description of instruments and the mean\r\nresults of the solar or other azimuthal observations. The latitude and\r\nlongitude of the observing station is given. If this is not at a corner\r\nof the survey, the latitude and longitude of the first corner described\r\nshould be given, thus:\r\n\r\n      At Cor. No. 1 of the Jim Dandy lode, identical with Cor. No.\r\n      1 of the Prince Lode of this survey, in latitude 38°45′ N,\r\n      and longitude 106°20′ W.\r\n\r\nA description of the measuring devices follows the observation for\r\nazimuth. If an electronic distance measuring device is used, the name\r\nand serial number should be given. It should also be stated that it was\r\ntested by measuring a known distance before and after the survey, and\r\nfound correct.\r\n\r\nCorner markings as shown are acceptable for stone monuments or wood\r\nposts. When a monument with a cap is used, the following marks would be\r\nmore suitable:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe X has been omitted from the inscription on bearing trees which is\r\nincorrect, unless the measurement was taken to the center of the tree.\r\nIt should be included, thus: JD–1–20220A XBT or JD–1–PRI–1–20220A XBT if\r\nthe full complement of marks are shown.\r\n\r\nWhen giving intersections only the distance to the line being\r\nintersected is given for claims of the survey as the distance to the\r\ncorner on the line being intersected will be given later in the notes\r\nwhen that claim is described.\r\n\r\nWhen the intersection is with a prior mineral survey or unsurveyed\r\nlocation, the distance should be given to a corner within the claim, or\r\nthe same corner each time the line is intersected. See the intersection\r\nof lines 2–3 and 3–4 of the Protector lode with Sur. No. 20100 Silver\r\nlode.\r\n\r\nNote that intersections are given to the nearest hundredth of a foot,\r\nwhile distances to items of topography and culture are to the nearest\r\nfoot. Distances given in ties including bearing objects should be to the\r\nhundredth of a foot.\r\n\r\nThe area statement should show all conflicts and be so arranged that any\r\nexclusion may be made and the net area to be patented readily\r\nobtainable. This can best be done by starting with the oldest survey and\r\nprogressing through the various conflicts, but this may not hold true if\r\na prior survey has not been patented. A copy of the preliminary plat may\r\nbe used to color the exclusions and make certain that all have been\r\nproperly stated.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading “LOCATION” it is important to state that the survey is\r\nidentical with the location as marked on the ground or to state the\r\ndifferences. When describing corners, ties should be given to location\r\nmonuments when they are not identical. See the Prince Lode in the\r\nspecimen notes.\r\n\r\nOnly those improvements counting toward the $500 expenditure are to be\r\ngiven under the heading “IMPROVEMENTS.” In such case, the discovery\r\nworking should be numbered one. If there is no discovery working, but a\r\ndiscovery point is called for, it may be described and labeled No. 1.\r\nAny improvements that do not count toward the patent expenditure or\r\nthose that have been made by others should be listed under “OTHER\r\nIMPROVEMENTS.”\r\n\r\n“OTHER CORNER DESCRIPTIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA” is a very important\r\npart of the notes since it contains the report on prior surveys. Do not\r\nreport another mineral surveyor in error for minor discrepancies in\r\nbearings and distances. The phrase, “substantially correct as approved”\r\nmay be used, or “approximately correct as approved.”\r\n\r\nUnder “MEMORANDUM” differences with the calls given in the location\r\ncertificate may be explained, as well as typographical errors in the\r\ncertificate.\r\n\r\nBecause of corrections that may be required by the Bureau of Land\r\nManagement it is well to prepare a preliminary draft of the notes for\r\nsubmitting to the BLM. The final typing, in triplicate, can be\r\naccomplished after all differences have been resolved.\r\n\r\n=5–11= The field notes and preliminary plat should be sent to the State\r\nOffice of the Bureau of Land Management by either certified or\r\nregistered mail with a return receipt requested. A copy of the\r\npreliminary plat may also be sent to the claimant with a copy of the\r\nletter of transmittal to the BLM.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the returns of mineral survey should remain confidential\r\nuntil the survey is approved. The mineral surveyor should maintain this\r\nconfidence. If a demand is made of the Bureau of Land Management under\r\nthe Freedom of Information Act, then the preliminary nature of the work\r\nshould be clearly stated to the recipient.\r\n\r\n\r\nProcessing the Survey\r\n\r\n=5–12= Preliminary Examination of Field Notes: The examination of the\r\nsurvey may begin by reading the notes and comparing them with the\r\npreliminary plat. As a general rule the mineral surveyor will write the\r\nnotes from the plat. If inconsistencies appear, they will usually be\r\ntypographical errors in the notes. However, this must be verified by the\r\nmineral surveyor.\r\n\r\nParticular attention should be given to the format as shown by the\r\nspecimen notes of the Manual of Surveying Instructions, 1973.\r\n\r\nCorner descriptions must be proper and adequate. Ties should agree with\r\nthe preliminary plat. Discovery points must be on public domain.\r\n\r\nBy posting the mineral survey to the connecting sheet or similar plat\r\nwith a pencil, conflicts and other surveys within 100 feet may be\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\nThe names of the locations must agree with those given in the location\r\ncertificates. End lines must be parallel and the statutory length and\r\nwidth cannot be exceeded. Improvements should be fairly valued; the\r\ndiscovery point should agree with that given in the location\r\ncertificate; common improvements should be correctly described and all\r\nclaims benefiting therefrom should share equally. The geographic\r\nposition of one corner of the survey must be given. Under “LOCATION” the\r\ncorrect section, township and range should be given.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that the survey is identical with the location as\r\nmarked on the ground. If not identical, it should be so stated, and ties\r\nto location monuments must be given.\r\n\r\nThe section corner tie may not exceed two miles from the nearest corner\r\nof the survey. Intersections with the lode lines and distances along the\r\nlode line to the discovery point must be given. (Exception: bedded\r\ndeposits.) The bearing of the lode line, if different from the side\r\nlines, must be shown on the plat.\r\n\r\nReports on former surveys should be checked against the notes of these\r\nsurveys. The bearings and distances of lines of former surveys that are\r\nwholly within the survey or a claim of the survey must be given.\r\n\r\nThe area statement should be reviewed to make certain that conflicts are\r\ngiven in chronological order and that any exclusion or combination of\r\nexclusions can be ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic declination must be given. The beginning and completion\r\ndates of the survey must be given. The survey cannot begin prior to the\r\ndate of order.\r\n\r\n=5–13= Calculations: Calculations may begin by computing the solar\r\nobservation; the declination should be verified, also the latitude and\r\nlongitude. The survey should close. Lode claims should have a perfect\r\nclosure; irregular claims such as placers should close within 0.5 feet\r\nin 1,000 feet. The statutory length and width of lode claims may not be\r\nexceeded. The width at right angles to the lode cannot exceed 300 feet\r\non either side. The section corner ties within the survey may be checked\r\nby closure, using short ties between claims of the survey; each section\r\ntie and short tie should be used in at least one closure. The closures\r\nshould not exceed 0.5 feet in 1,000 feet. (It may be necessary to report\r\nthe longer section ties to an even number of seconds such as 15″.)\r\n\r\nThe section corner ties should be checked against those given in\r\nconflicting surveys using the short ties given to these claims along\r\nwith the reported boundaries. Such closures, depending on the length of\r\nthe ties, should not exceed 10 feet. If they do exceed this distance,\r\nthe correct tie should be given under “OTHER CORNER DESCRIPTIONS AND\r\nSUPPLEMENTAL DATA” provided that the corner from which the tie was made\r\nwas recovered. If the corner was not found, the error cannot be\r\nreported. The same applies to short ties between conflicting surveys,\r\nbut the allowable error should be within the 1:2000 limit. If more than\r\none section corner is tied, the bearing and distance along the section\r\nline should be checked, reporting any appreciable difference under\r\n“OTHER CORNER DESCRIPTIONS AND SUPPLEMENTAL DATA.”\r\n\r\nThe bearings and distances of intersections with lines of prior surveys\r\nshould be correctly stated. This may be verified by closure, but if a\r\nclosure of 1:2000 is not obtained, it will be necessary to calculate the\r\nintersections by solving triangles, to determine where the error lies.\r\nSuch intersections should check with 0.2 feet.\r\n\r\nFrom the intersections obtained, the areas of conflict should next be\r\ncalculated. If the final plat is drawn at a scale of 1″ = 200′,\r\nconflicts with a conflict, i.e. double conflicts, may be checked by\r\ndividing the area of conflict into triangles and scaling the base and\r\naltitude. The mineral surveyor, however, must actually calculate these\r\nareas. All areas should check within 0.02 acres.\r\n\r\n=5–14= Platting Procedures: The lines of the survey are shown heavier\r\nthan those of former surveys so that the locations of the survey will\r\nstand out.\r\n\r\nAll corners recovered or set are shown with a circle to distinguish them\r\nfrom corners not found.\r\n\r\nThe lode line is shown as a broken line and if parallel to the side\r\nlines, only the distance each way from the discovery point is shown; if\r\nnot parallel, then the bearing must also be shown. The bearings and\r\ntotal distances of the lines of the survey are shown heavier than those\r\nof conflicting surveys and intersections along such lines.\r\n\r\nThe names of the locations of the survey shall be shown in vertical\r\ncapital letters and be larger and heavier than those of conflicting\r\nsurveys, which shall be shown in upper and lower case.\r\n\r\nDistances to intersections along the line of survey should be shown\r\nbefore the intersection. Intersections with lines of prior surveys are\r\ngiven preference over topographic items. Where space will not permit the\r\nshowing of a distance, it may be placed above a prior distance, with the\r\nfirst distance shown next to the line.\r\n\r\nBearings of conflicting surveys are usually shown in the direction of\r\nthe line between corners as surveyed; i.e., from corner 1 to corner 2,\r\netc. Bearings and distances in all cases should be shown along the line\r\nthey pertain to. Bearings of ties should be shown in the direction from\r\nthe corner from which the tie was made. Ties will be shown with light\r\nbroken lines. If there is not room to place the bearing and distance\r\nnext to the line, it may be placed on an arrow.\r\n\r\nAll bearings and distances shall be in slant lettering. Witness corners\r\nare shown with a circle and labeled W.C. Cor. No.——, provided they are\r\non a line of the survey. If not on line they are shown with a tie.\r\n\r\nSurveyed section lines and surveyed subdivision of section lines are\r\nshown by solid lines; unsurveyed lines are shown with a broken line.\r\n\r\nDesignation of subdivisions, Township and Range should be vertical\r\nletters. The discovery workings and all other improvements are labeled;\r\nthey may be numbered to agree with the field notes. It is not necessary\r\nto give a tie to the improvements, except a common improvement tunnel,\r\nshaft, etc.\r\n\r\nThe title block shown on the specimen plat in the Manual of Surveying\r\nInstructions should be closely followed. While the plat scale is usually\r\n200 feet to an inch, it may be smaller to accommodate several claims,\r\nprovided the necessary data can be shown. Where more than one sheet is\r\nnecessary, only the final sheet need have a title block. All sheets\r\nshould carry the survey number and state that it is sheet No. —— of ——\r\nsheets.\r\n\r\nWhen the plat is finished it should be compared with the field notes.\r\nThis can be done by two people, one reading the notes and the other\r\nfollowing the plat; or two people can independently do the comparing. If\r\nrough draft notes were submitted by the mineral surveyor, they should be\r\nreturned to him with the corrections for final typing, and execution of\r\nthe “Certificate of Surveyor,” current Form 3860–7.\r\n\r\nThe final typing will consist of the original set on current Form\r\n9180–21, which is bound on the left, with two carbon copies on current\r\nForm 9180–22, which is bound at the top; this may vary with state office\r\npractice. (Xerox or similar copies are not acceptable.)\r\n\r\n=5–15= Approval of Survey: The lower portion of current Form 3860–7,\r\n“Certificate of Surveyor,” contains the certificate of approval to be\r\nsigned by an officer of the Bureau of Land Management. This may be the\r\nState Director or he may delegate this authority to the Chief, Division\r\nor Branch of Cadastral Surveys, for that state. He should also sign the\r\ncertificate of transcript for the two carbon copies.\r\n\r\nCurrent Form 3860–8, certifying $500 expenditure, must also be executed\r\nby the above authorized officer and attached to the copy of the field\r\nnotes that will be filed with the application for patent. If $500 has\r\nnot been expended, it is the claimant’s responsibility to complete the\r\nwork and have the certificate executed and filed with the BLM Branch of\r\nLand and Minerals (land office) prior to the expiration of the period of\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nIf the survey has been properly executed and shows the facts, the State\r\nDirector cannot refuse to approve the survey because he feels that the\r\nclaim is invalid. (See 57 I.D. 63, Raymond E. Johnson, 1939.)\r\n\r\nThe original field notes and plat are then placed in the open files of\r\nthe Bureau of Land Management. The location certificates are to be\r\nincluded with the notes. The two transcripts of the field notes together\r\nwith two cloth backed copies, one of which has been waterproofed for\r\nposting, and a plain paper copy of the plat, will then be furnished the\r\nclaimant. An additional copy for posting will be furnished if a mill\r\nsite is included in the survey.\r\n\r\nOne set of the notes and one copy of the plat will be used to support\r\nthe application for patent. Current Form 3860–4, is used to notify the\r\nState Branch of Land and Minerals and the Director, Bureau of Land\r\nManagement, of the approval of the survey and includes a sketch of the\r\nsurvey. This form is also used to notify the Regional Forester if the\r\nsurvey is on a National Forest.\r\n\r\nThe mineral surveyor should be notified by letter of the approval of the\r\nsurvey and he should be furnished a paper copy of the plat and requested\r\nto examine it at his early convenience. (See appendix for copies of\r\nforms.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDepartures from the Normal Procedure\r\n\r\n=5–16= Cancellation of Surveys: A patented mineral survey may never be\r\ncancelled. An unpatented mineral survey may be cancelled only after the\r\nclaim has been declared null and void or relinquished by the claimant;\r\nthen it need not be cancelled until it is necessary to do so to\r\naccommodate an entry or administrative action. It can be cancelled only\r\nby the officer of the Bureau of Land Management authorized to approve\r\nmineral surveys.\r\n\r\nIn the past, claims could be declared null and void only after a\r\nsuccessful contest had been brought against the claim. After October 21,\r\n1979, claims must be recorded with the Bureau of Land Management within\r\n90 days of the location date or they will automatically be deemed to\r\nhave been abandoned and void.\r\n\r\nThe procedure is as follows: When the Chief, Branch of Cadastral Surveys\r\nof the State Office is notified that a claim has been declared null and\r\nvoid, a notation to that effect should be made on the plat of survey (or\r\nif the plat is in the archives, it may be made on the card index). No\r\nfurther action is necessary at this time; the survey is not cancelled.\r\n\r\nCancellation becomes necessary if an entry or administrative action,\r\nincluding a survey or resurvey, involves the land embraced in the\r\nmineral survey. Current Form 3860–4, Approval of Mineral Survey, may be\r\nused to cancel the survey and to notify the Director of the Bureau of\r\nLand Management and any other interested parties substituting the word\r\n“cancelled” or “cancellation” for approval or it may be by memorandum.\r\n\r\nShould a supplemental plat be required to lot the area embraced in the\r\nsurvey, a certified set of the field notes of the survey and the mineral\r\nsurvey plat should accompany the plat to Washington, as they do not have\r\nthe field notes of unpatented mineral surveys. The field notes of the\r\ncancelled survey becomes the basis for the new lot designation. The\r\nDirector’s memoranda of July 14, 1958 and November 17, 1960, cover the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n=5–17= Unapproved Survey: Occasionally an order for survey will be\r\ncancelled and it is not known how far the mineral surveyor has proceeded\r\nwith the field work and what corners have been set and marked. In no\r\ncase should the corners be removed as they still serve as corners of the\r\nlocation which may be perfectly valid. The survey number should not be\r\nre-used inasmuch as it will serve to identify the corners on the ground.\r\n\r\n=5–18= Additional Notes and Certificate on Plat: In the past, additional\r\nnotes were sometimes prepared from the existing record along with\r\namendment to the plat in red ink and accompanying certificate when there\r\nwas an omission of a conflict with an agricultural or other patent, a\r\npending entry or an adverse claim.\r\n\r\nFor example: A survey was approved without showing the conflict with a\r\nlegal subdivision that had been included in a preemption homestead. The\r\nsubdivision was protracted on the mineral survey plat from the township\r\nsurvey, based on the section corner tie given in the mineral survey,\r\nintersections given with the boundaries of the subdivision, and an area\r\nof conflict calculated. All plats were recalled for the amendment. The\r\nadditional notes were written, in triplicate, by the cadastral surveyor,\r\nto show only the lines of the mineral survey involved in the conflict,\r\ngiving the intersections. The area statement was rewritten to the extent\r\nnecessary to show the area of conflict.\r\n\r\nThe same procedure was followed if an adverse claim was to be excluded\r\non the basis of the description in its location certificate. Red ink was\r\nused on the plats to distinguish the amendment, but black ink was used\r\nif the certificate specifically stated the extent of the amendment.\r\n\r\nMost offices now resolve the above situations solely through a\r\nmemorandum process.\r\n\r\n=5–19= Amended Surveys and Amended Plats: This is occasioned by an error\r\nin the original survey that is not discovered until after the survey is\r\napproved, or for the same reasons listed in 5–18 above, where the\r\namendment cannot be made from the existing record and additional field\r\nwork is required. The claimant may also request an amended survey. The\r\nclaimant bears the cost. Example: In Survey No. 19202A-Am. Colorado, the\r\nwrong claim was included in the survey. The correct claim was included\r\nin the amended survey which covered the same ground.\r\n\r\n=5–20= A new survey is required if the claim boundaries are changed by\r\namendment after the original survey is approved. Section 10–62, page 226\r\nof the Manual of Surveying Instructions states: “An amended survey must\r\nbe made in strict conformity with, or be embraced within the lines of\r\nthe original survey.” A new survey is also required where the claim has\r\nbeen abandoned and relocated by another.\r\n\r\n=5–21= Expenditure of $500 After the Survey is Approved: Supplemental\r\nnotes based on a supplemental order for survey, either to the original\r\nmineral surveyor or another mineral surveyor, must be submitted and\r\nattached to the original field notes. The supplemental notes must\r\ncontain a full description of all improvements. If the additional\r\nexpenditure applies only to one claim of a group, only the expenditures\r\nof that claim need to be recited. Current Form 3860–8, Certificate of\r\nExpenditures, must be executed and attached to the claimant’s copy of\r\nthe notes for filing with the patent application.\r\n\r\n=5–22= If patent is applied for long after the survey was approved, a\r\nstatement from the Chief, Branch of Cadastral Survey, will be required\r\nby the Branch of Land and Minerals to the effect that the plat correctly\r\nshows all conflicts, or listing the later surveys with which a conflict\r\nexists.\r\n\r\nIf later surveys did not exclude the survey in question, the plat will\r\nbe returned by the Branch of Land and Minerals for amendment, and\r\namended notes will have to be written. If the applicant is not the same\r\nas the claimant shown at the time of the survey, he is entitled to use\r\nthe survey provided he can show a chain of title. If he does not have\r\nthe necessary plats and notes, the Branch of Cadastral Survey will\r\nsupply him with the necessary copies. The claimant bears all costs.\r\n\r\n=5–23= Occasions have arisen where a claim or survey excluded from the\r\npatent is later abandoned. A supplemental application for patent may be\r\nmade for the excluded ground. The procedure to be followed is the same\r\nas given in 5–22 above. Copies of the plats, including those for posting\r\nand the notes must be furnished the applicant.\r\n\r\n=5–24= Patent Applied for in Two Parts: When only a part of the claims\r\nof a survey are applied for and patented, and later application for\r\npatent is made for the remaining claims, a copy of the plat, or if the\r\nplat is in more than one sheet, the sheets showing the claim, must be\r\nposted, and a copy, together with a transcript of that portion of the\r\nfield notes pertaining to the claims, filed with the Branch of Lands and\r\nMinerals at the time the supplemental application for patent is made. If\r\nnot all sheets of the plat are used, be sure that the ones used show all\r\nties and pertinent information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                              CHAPTER VI\r\n                                                               Resurveys\r\n\r\n\r\n=6–1= Restoration of Lost Corners: There is no hard and fast rule for\r\nestablishing missing corners of mining claims. The method should be\r\nselected that will give the best results, bearing in mind that end lines\r\nshould remain substantially parallel. Ordinarily, the mineral surveyor\r\nshould not remonument a restored corner; at least, it should not be done\r\nwithout the full knowledge and approval of the owner. A cadastral\r\nsurveyor may remonument a corner if it is necessary to delineate the\r\nboundary between public and private land. As with all lost corners, the\r\ncorner of a mineral survey should be reestablished from the best\r\navailable evidence and in such a configuration that will place the lines\r\nas nearly as possible to their original position. The ties to bearing\r\ntrees and objects should be used first. In fact, if such accessories are\r\npresent the corner is not lost.\r\n\r\nSecond in order of preference is the use of short ties to or from\r\nadjoining surveys. A word of caution in using other mineral survey ties:\r\nIn Colorado, and presumably in other states, there was a period where\r\nthe short ties to conflicting surveys were calculated through the\r\nsection corner tie. Such calculated ties should not be used. This period\r\nis not exactly known, but it ran approximately from 1898 to April 28,\r\n1904. If a report of other surveys was contained in the field notes, the\r\nties were not calculated. At the end of this period, it can be\r\ndetermined if calculations were used. It is not so easy to distinguish\r\nbetween the methods of survey at the beginning of the period since it\r\nwas not customary to report on other surveys. In any event, the short\r\ntie should not be used unless the corner tied to (or from) is recovered.\r\nIf no corners can be found, the section corner tie may be used, but it\r\nis the tie of last resort. In such cases, all lines are shown as\r\napproved.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 7, several conditions are illustrated. In situation A, only\r\none corner is recovered, no other corners or accessories can be found\r\nnor are there any short ties available. In the absence of further\r\ncollateral evidence, the three missing corners must be reestablished at\r\nrecord bearings and distances from the recovered Corner No. 1.\r\n\r\nIn situation B, Corners Nos. 1 and 2 can be recovered. Lines 4–1 and 2–3\r\nshould be shown at the record distance, regardless of the length of line\r\n1–2. The bearings of lines 4–1 and 2–3 may be the record bearing or at\r\nthe same variation from the record as line 1–2. If this was a\r\nrectangular claim, then the bearing of the missing lines probably should\r\nbe at right angles to line 1–2, unless this would give a distorted\r\nrelationship between the claim and the workings on it, particularly the\r\ndiscovery. Line 3–4 should be shown parallel and of equal length to line\r\n1–2.\r\n\r\nIn situation C, Corners Nos. 1 and 4 are recovered. Line 2–3 should be\r\nshown parallel and of equal length to line 4–1, if the record was such.\r\nLines 1–2 and 3–4 should be shown at the record distance, and at the\r\nrecord bearing or with the same variance found for line 4–1.\r\n\r\nIn situation D two corners are again recovered, but they are opposite\r\ncorners, Nos. 1 and 3. Missing Corner Nos. 2 and 4 can be restored by\r\nusing the Grant Boundary method. See Section 5–44 of the Manual of\r\nSurveying Instructions. They can also be shown at the record bearing and\r\ndistance from Cors. Nos. 1 and 3, using either the end lines or side\r\nlines, with the resulting missing lines being the bearing and distance\r\nrequired to close. The method selected should restore the lines in the\r\nbest relative position to the workings.\r\n\r\nIn situation E, three corners, 1, 2 and 4, are recovered. Line 2–3 is\r\nshown parallel and of equal length to line 4–1. Line 3–4 is shown\r\nparallel and of equal length to Line 1–2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 7\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn restoring corners of irregular claims, such as metes and bounds\r\nplacers, the broken boundary (non-riparian) or the Grant Boundary method\r\nshould be used. It may also be applied to lode claims if the above\r\nmethods do not give adequate results.\r\n\r\nIn reestablishing corners of a block of claims, the rules of\r\nproportionate measurement may be applied. In Figure 8, missing Corner\r\nNo. 2 of claims E, F, G and H can be restored by double proportion.\r\nMissing Corner No. 1 of claims A and B may also be restored by double\r\nproportion; since there is no corner beyond this corner, the record\r\ndistance from Corner No. 2 would have to be used in this direction.\r\nCorner No. 1 might also be established at the record bearing and\r\ndistance from Corner No. 2, or lines 1–2 of claims A and B could be made\r\nparallel and of equal length to line 3–4 of claim A. Since missing\r\nCorner No. 3 of claims B and D is on an end line, single proportionate\r\nmeasurement might be considered. See the Manual of Surveying\r\nInstructions for proportionate methods, pp. 134–136.\r\n\r\n=6–2= Township Resurveys with Mineral Surveys: Prior to field work, all\r\nunpatented mineral surveys embracing claims that have been declared null\r\nand void should be cancelled, leaving only valid existing claims and\r\npatents to be segregated. Restoration of missing corners should only be\r\nmade where they are necessary to control the boundaries between private\r\nand public land, including the boundaries between public land and\r\nunpatented valid mineral surveys. Segregation surveys of unsurveyed\r\nmining claims may be requested to accommodate administrative actions. If\r\npossible, the owners of the mining claims should be advised of the\r\nresurvey and given an opportunity to express their opinions as to the\r\nposition of missing corners.\r\n\r\n=6–3= Mineral Segregation Surveys: Sections 7–39 to 7–44 inclusive, of\r\nthe Manual of Surveying Instructions adequately covers this subject.\r\nSegregation surveys are not undertaken unless there is a need for them\r\narising from administrative action involving the adjoining land. Very\r\noften it will be necessary to make the survey within the boundaries as\r\nthey are marked on the ground due to inaccuracies in the location\r\nsurvey. The early township surveys in California often segregated\r\nunsurveyed mining claims showing them on the township plats without\r\nsupporting field notes. Resurveys of such segregations may be required\r\nbased on the evidence found in the field.\r\n\r\n=6–4= Supplemental Plats: When supplemental plats are required\r\nsegregating mineral surveys, all such surveys must be segregated. Again,\r\nit is desirable that mineral surveys embracing invalid claims be\r\ncancelled. The need to lot a cancelled mineral survey will also require\r\na supplemental plat.\r\n\r\n=6–5= Correcting Errors in Patented Mineral Surveys: As a general rule,\r\nthe record of a patented mineral survey should not be changed or\r\namended. When such errors are discovered, a pencil notation on the index\r\ncard and/or on the field notes may be appropriate. Reported errors\r\ngenerally stand on their own merit and are contained in the field notes\r\nof the reporting survey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        GLOSSARY OF MINING TERMS\r\n\r\n\r\n  ADIT: a horizontal entry into a mine with one opening to the surface,\r\n    commonly and erroneously called a tunnel.
