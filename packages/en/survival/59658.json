ROBERT JAMESON,\r\n\r\n     Of the University of Edinburgh, my first Teacher in Geology,\r\n\r\n         whose Lectures I attended, and whose kind Advice and\r\n\r\n            Guidance I enjoyed, in the Winter of 1840-1841.\r\n\r\n\r\nHeadlands and Spurs--Popular Papers on Leading Topics--Revisiting Old\r\nLocalities--Dedications--General Scope of the Work\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_THE STARTING-POINT._\r\n\r\n\r\nAn explorer trudging along some line of coast, or traversing some\r\nmountain region, may now and then reach a projecting headland, or bold\r\nmountain spur, which may enable him to command a wide view of shore\r\nand sea, or of hill and valley, before and behind. On such a salient\r\npoint he may sit down, note-book and glass in hand, and endeavour to\r\ncorrelate the observations made on the ground he has traversed, and\r\nmay strain his eyes forward in order to anticipate the features of\r\nthe track in advance. Such are the salient points in a scientific\r\npilgrimage of more than half a century, to which I desire to invite\r\nthe attention of the readers of these papers. In doing so, I do not\r\npropose to refer, except incidentally, to subjects which I have already\r\ndiscussed in books accessible to general readers, but rather to those\r\nwhich are imbedded in little accessible transactions, or scientific\r\nperiodicals, or which have fallen out of print. I cannot therefore\r\npretend to place the reader on all the salient points of geological\r\nscience, or even on all of those I have myself reached, but merely to\r\nlead him to some of the viewing-places which I have found particularly\r\ninstructive to myself.\r\n\r\nFor similar reasons it is inevitable that a certain personal element\r\nshall enter into these reminiscences, though this autobiographical\r\nfeature will be kept as much in the background as possible. It is\r\nalso to be anticipated that the same subject may appear more than\r\nonce, but from different points of view, since it is often useful to\r\ncontemplate certain features of the landscape from more than one place\r\nof observation.\r\n\r\nTo drop the figure, the reader will find in these papers, in a plain\r\nand popular form, yet it is hoped not in a superficial manner, some\r\nof the more important conclusions of a geological worker of the old\r\nschool, who, while necessarily giving attention to certain specialties,\r\nhas endeavoured to take a broad and comprehensive view of the making of\r\nthe world in all its aspects.\r\n\r\nThe papers are of various dates; but in revising them for publication\r\nI have endeavoured, without materially changing their original form,\r\nto bring them up to the present time, and to state any corrections or\r\nchanges of view that have commended themselves to me in the meantime.\r\nSuch changes or modifications of view must of necessity occur to every\r\ngeological worker. Sometimes, after long digging and hammering in some\r\nbed rich in fossils, and carrying home a bag laden with treasures, one\r\nhas returned to the spot, and turned over the _débris_ of previous\r\nexcavation, with the result of finding something rare and valuable,\r\nbefore overlooked. Or, in carefully trimming and chiselling out the\r\nmatrix of a new fossil, so as to uncover all its parts, unexpected\r\nand novel features may develop themselves. Thus, if we were right or\r\npartially right before, our new experience may still enable us to\r\nenlarge our views or to correct some misapprehensions. In that spirit\r\nI have endeavoured to revise these papers, and while I have been able\r\nto add confirmations of views long ago expressed, have been willing to\r\naccept corrections and modifications based on later discoveries.\r\n\r\nIn the somewhat extended span of work which has been allotted to me,\r\nI have made it my object to discover new facts, and to this end have\r\nspared no expenditure of time and labour; but I have felt that the\r\nresults of discoveries in the works of God should not be confined to a\r\ncoterie, but should be made public for the benefit of all. Hence I have\r\ngladly embraced any opportunities to popularise my results, whether in\r\nlectures, articles, popular books, or in the instruction of students,\r\nand this in a manner to give accurate knowledge, and perhaps to attract\r\nthe attention of fellow-workers to points which they might overlook if\r\npresented merely in dry and technical papers. These objects I have in\r\nview in connection with the present collection of papers, and also the\r\nfact that my own pilgrimage is approaching its close, and that I desire\r\nto aid others who may chance to traverse the ground I have passed over,\r\nor who may be preparing to pass beyond the point I have reached.\r\n\r\nTo a naturalist of seventy years the greater part of life lies in the\r\npast, and in revising these papers I have necessarily had my thoughts\r\ndirected to the memory of friends, teachers, guides, and companions in\r\nlabour, who have passed away. I have therefore, as a slight token of\r\nloving and grateful remembrance dedicated these papers to the memory\r\nof men I have known and loved, and who, I feel, would sympathise with\r\nme in spirit, in the attempt, however feeble, to direct attention to\r\nthe variety and majesty of those great works of the Creator which they\r\nthemselves delighted to study.\r\n\r\nSince the design of these papers excludes special details as to\r\nCanadian geology, or that of those old eastern countries to which I\r\nhave given some attention, I must refer for them to other works, and\r\nshall append such reference of this kind as may be necessary. At the\r\nsame time it will be observed that as my geological work has been\r\nconcerned most largely with the oldest and newest rocks of the earth,\r\nand with the history of life rather than with rocks and minerals, there\r\nmust necessarily be some preponderance in these directions, which might\r\nhowever, independently of personal considerations, be justified by\r\nthe actual value of these lines of investigation, and by the special\r\ninterest attaching to them in the present state of scientific discovery.\r\n\r\nHaving thus defined my starting-point, I would now with all respect and\r\ndeference ask the reader to accompany me from point to point, and to\r\nexamine for himself the objects which may appear either near, or in the\r\ndim uncertain distance, in illustration of what the world is, and how\r\nit became what it is. Perhaps, in doing so, he may be able to perceive\r\nmuch more than I have been able to discover; and if so, I shall\r\nrejoice, even if such further insight should correct or counteract\r\nsome of my own impressions. It is not given to any one age or set of\r\nmen to comprehend all the mysteries of nature, or to arrive at a point\r\nwhere it can be said, there is no need of farther exploration. Even in\r\nthe longest journey of the most adventurous traveller there is an end\r\nof discovery, and, in the study of nature, cape rises beyond cape and\r\nmountain behind mountain interminably. The finite cannot comprehend\r\nthe infinite, the temporal the eternal. We need not, however, on that\r\naccount be agnostics, for it is still true that, within the scope of\r\nour narrow powers and opportunities, the Supreme Intelligence reveals\r\nto us in nature His power and divinity; and it is this, and this alone,\r\nthat gives attraction and dignity to natural science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            _WORLD-MAKING._\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF\r\n\r\n            ADAM SEDGWICK AND SIR RODERICK IMPEY MURCHISON,\r\n\r\n                      Whose joint Labours carried\r\n\r\n               our Knowledge of the History of the Earth\r\n\r\n                       two Stages farther back,\r\n\r\n              and whose Differences of Opinion served to\r\n\r\n                 render more glorious their Victories.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.

In these circumstances I became\r\naware of the presence of an unearthly visitor, who announced himself\r\nas of celestial birth, and intimated to me that being himself free\r\nfrom those restrictions of space and time which are so embarrassing\r\nto earthly students, he was prepared for the moment to share these\r\nadvantages with me, and to introduce me to certain outlying parts of\r\nthe universe, where I might learn something of its origin and early\r\nhistory. He took my hand, and instantly we were in the voids of space.\r\nTurning after a moment, he pointed to a small star and said, \"That is\r\nthe star you call the sun; here, you see, it is only about the third\r\nmagnitude, and in a few seconds it will disappear.\" These few seconds,\r\nindeed, reduced the whole visible firmament to a mere nebulous haze\r\nlike the Milky Way, and we seemed to be in blank space. But pausing for\r\na moment I became aware that around us were multitudes of dark bodies,\r\nso black that they were, so to speak, negatively visible, even in the\r\nalmost total darkness around. Some seemed large and massive, some a\r\nmere drift of minute particles, formless and without distinct limits.\r\nSome were swiftly moving, others stationary, or merely revolving on\r\ntheir own axes. It was a \"horror of great darkness,\" and I trembled\r\nwith fear. \"This,\" said my guide, \"is what the old Hebrew seer called\r\n_tohu ve bohu_, 'formless and void,' the 'Tiamat' or abyss of the\r\nold Chaldeans, the 'chaos and old night' of the Greeks. Your mundane\r\nphysicists have not seen it, but they speculate regarding it, and\r\noccupy themselves with questions as to whether it can be lightened\r\nand vivified by mere attractive force, or by collision of dark bodies\r\nimpinging on each other with vast momentum. Their speculations are\r\nvain, and lead to nothing, because they have no data wherefrom to\r\ncalculate the infinite and eternal Power who determined either the\r\nattraction or the motion, or who willed which portion of this chaos was\r\nto become cosmos, and which was to remain for ever dead and dark. Let\r\nus turn, however, to a more hopeful prospect.\" We sped away to another\r\nscene. Here were vast luminous bodies, such as we call nebulæ. Some\r\nwere globular, others disc-like, others annular or like spiral wisps,\r\nand some were composed of several concentric shells or rings. All were\r\nin rapid rotation, and presented a glorious and brilliant spectacle.\r\n\"This,\" said my guide, \"is matter of the same kind with that we have\r\njust been considering; but it has been set in active motion. The fiat\r\n'Let there be light!' has been issued to it. Nor is its motion in\r\nvain. Each of these nebulous masses is the material of a system of\r\nworlds, and they will produce systems of different forms in accordance\r\nwith the various shapes and motions which you observe. Such bodies\r\nare well known to earthly astronomers. One of them, the great nebula\r\nof Andromeda, has been photographed, and is a vast system of luminous\r\nrings of vapour placed nearly edgewise to the earth, and hundreds of\r\ntimes greater than the whole solar system. But now let us annihilate\r\ntime, and consider these gigantic bodies as they will be in the course\r\nof many millions of years.\" Instantaneously these vast nebulæ had\r\nconcentrated themselves into systems of suns and planets, but with\r\nthis difference from ours, that the suns were very large and surrounded\r\nwith a wide luminous haze, and each of the planets was self-luminous,\r\nlike a little sun. In some the planets were dancing up and down in\r\nspiral lines. In others they were moving in one plane. In still others,\r\nin every variety of direction. Some had vast numbers of little planets\r\nand satellites. Others had a few of larger size. There were even\r\nsome of these systems that had a pair of central suns of contrasting\r\ncolours. The whole scene was so magnificent and beautiful that I\r\nthought I could never weary of gazing on it. \"Here,\" said he, \"we have\r\nthe most beautiful condition of systems of worlds, when considered from\r\na merely physical point of view: the perfection of solar and planetary\r\nluminousness, but which is destined to pass away in the interest of\r\nthings more important, if less showy. This is the condition of the\r\ngreat star Sirius, which the old priest astronomers of the Nile Valley\r\nmade so much of in their science and religion, and which they called\r\nSothis. It is now known by your star-gazers to be vastly larger than\r\nyour sun, and fifty times more brilliant.[1] Let us select one of these\r\nsystems somewhat similar to the solar system, and suppose that the\r\nluminous atmospheres of its nearer planets are beginning to wane in\r\nbrilliancy. Here is one of them, through whose halo of light we can see\r\nthe body of the planet. What do you now perceive?\" The planet referred\r\nto was somewhat larger in appearance than our earth, and, approaching\r\nnear to it, I could see that it had a cloud-bearing firmament, and\r\nthat it seemed to have continents and oceans, though disposed in more\r\nregular forms than on our own planet, and with a smaller proportion of\r\nland. Looking at it more closely, I searched in vain for any sign of\r\nanimal life, but I saw a vast profusion of what might be plants, but\r\nnot like those of this world.[2] These were trees of monstrous stature,\r\nand their leaves, which were of great size and shaped like fronds of\r\nseaweeds, were not usually green, but variegated with red, crimson and\r\norange. The surface of the land looked like beds of gigantic specimens\r\nof _Colias_ and similar variegated-leaved plants, the whole presenting\r\na most gorgeous yet grotesque spectacle. \"This,\" said my guide, \"is the\r\nprimitive vegetation which clothes each of the planets in its youthful\r\nstate. The earth was once so clothed, in the time when vegetable life\r\nalone existed, and there were no animals to prey upon it, and when the\r\nearth was, like the world you now look upon, a paradise of plants; for\r\nall things in nature are at first in their best estate. This vegetation\r\nis known to you on the earth only by the Carbon and Graphite buried\r\nin your oldest rocks. It still lingers on your neighbour Mars,[3]\r\nwhich has, however, almost passed beyond this stage, and we are\r\nlooking forward before long to see a still more gigantic though paler\r\ndevelopment of it in altogether novel shapes on the great continents\r\nthat are being formed on the surface of Jupiter. But look again.\" And\r\ntime being again annihilated, I saw the same world, now destitute of\r\nany luminous envelope, with a few dark clouds in its atmosphere, and\r\npresenting just the same appearance which I would suppose our earth\r\nto present to an astronomer viewing it with a powerful telescope from\r\nthe moon. \"Here we are at home again,\" said my guide; \"good-bye.\" I\r\nfound myself nodding over my table, and that my pen had just dropped\r\nfrom my hand, making a large blot on my paper. My dream, however, gave\r\nme a hint as to a subject, and I determined to devote my address to a\r\nconsideration of questions which geology has not solved, or has only\r\nimperfectly and hypothetically discussed.\r\n\r\n[1] In evidence of these and other statements I may refer to Huggins'\r\nrecent address as President of the British Association, and to the\r\n\"Story of the Heavens,\" etc., by Sir Robert Ball.\r\n\r\n[2] We shall see farther on that there is reason to believe that the\r\nprimitive land vegetation was more different from that of the Devonian\r\nand Carboniferous than it is from that of the present day.\r\n\r\n[3] Mars is probably a stage behind the earth in its development, and\r\nthe ruddy hue of its continents would seem to b: due to some organic\r\ncovering.\r\n\r\nSuch unsolved or partially solved questions must necessarily exist in\r\na science which covers the whole history of the earth in time. At the\r\nbeginning it allies itself with astronomy and physics and celestial\r\nchemistry. At the end it runs into human history, and is mixed up with\r\narchæology and anthropology. Throughout its whole course it has to deal\r\nwith questions of meteorology, geography and biology. In short, there\r\nis no department of physical or biological science, with which this\r\nmany-sided study is not allied, or at least on which the geologist may\r\nnot presume to trespass. When, therefore, it is proposed to discuss\r\nin the present chapter some of the unsolved problems and disputed\r\nquestions of this universal science, the reader need not be surprised\r\nif it should be somewhat discursive.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we may begin at the utmost limits of the subject by remarking\r\nthat in matters of natural and physical science we are met at the\r\noutset with the scarcely solved question as to our own place in the\r\nnature which we study, and the bearing of this on the difficulties\r\nwe encounter. The organism of man is decidedly a part of nature. We\r\nplace ourselves, in this aspect, in the sub-kingdom vertebrata and\r\nclass mammalia, and recognise the fact that man is the terminal link\r\nin a chain of being, extending throughout geological time. But the\r\norganism is not all that belongs to man, and when we regard him as\r\na scientific inquirer, we raise a new question. If the human mind\r\nis a part of nature, then it is subject to natural law, and nature\r\nincludes mind as well as matter. Indeed, without being absolute\r\nidealists we may hold that mind is more potent than matter, and\r\nnearer to the real essence of things. Our science is in any case\r\nnecessarily dualistic, being the product of the reaction of mind on\r\nnature, and must be largely subjective and anthropomorphic. Hence,\r\nno doubt, arises much of the controversy of science, and much of the\r\nunsolved difficulty. We recognise this when we divide science into\r\nthat which is experimental, or depends on apparatus, and that which is\r\nobservational and classificatory--distinctions these which relate not\r\nso much to the objects of science as to our methods of pursuing them.\r\nThis view also opens up to us the thought that the domain of science\r\nis practically boundless, for who can set limits to the action of mind\r\non the universe, or of the universe on mind. It follows that science,\r\nas it exists at any one time, must be limited on all sides by unsolved\r\nmysteries; and it will not serve any good purpose to meet these with\r\nclever guesses. If we so treat the enigmas of the sphinx nature, we\r\nshall surely be devoured. Nor, on the other hand, must we collapse into\r\nabsolute despair, and resign ourselves to the confession of inevitable\r\nignorance. It becomes us rather boldly to confront the unsolved\r\nquestions of nature, and to wrestle with their difficulties till we\r\nmaster such as we can, and cheerfully leave those we cannot overcome to\r\nbe grappled with by our successors.\r\n\r\nFortunately, as a geologist, I do not need to invite attention to those\r\ntranscendental questions which relate to the ultimate constitution of\r\nmatter, the nature of the ethereal medium filling space, the absolute\r\ndifference or identity of chemical elements, the cause of gravitation,\r\nthe conservation and dissipation of energy, the nature of life, or the\r\nprimary origin of bioplasmic matter. I may take the much more humble\r\n_rôle_ of an inquirer into the unsolved or partially solved problems\r\nwhich meet us in considering that short and imperfect record which\r\ngeology studies in the rocky layers of the earth's crust, and which\r\nleads no farther back than to the time when a solid rind had already\r\nformed on the earth, and was already covered with an ocean. This record\r\nof geology covers but a small part of the history of the earth and of\r\nthe system to which it belongs, nor does it enter at all into the more\r\nrecondite problems involved; still it forms, I believe, some necessary\r\npreparation at least to the comprehension of these. If we are to go\r\nfarther back, we must accept the guidance of physicists rather than\r\nof geologists, and I must say that in this physical cosmology both\r\ngeologists and general readers are likely to find themselves perplexed\r\nwith the vagaries in which the most sober mathematicians may indulge.\r\nWe are told that the original condition of the solar system was that\r\nof a vaporous and nebulous cloud intensely heated and whirling rapidly\r\nround, that it probably came into this condition by the impact of two\r\ndark solid bodies striking each other so violently, that they became\r\nintensely heated and resolved into the smallest possible fragments.\r\nLord Kelvin attributes this impact to their being attracted together\r\nby gravitative force. Croll[4] argues that in addition to gravitation\r\nthese bodies must have had a proper motion of great velocity, which\r\nLord Kelvin thinks \"enormously\" improbable, as it would require the\r\nsolid bodies to be shot against each other with a marvellously true\r\naim, and this not in the case of the sun only, but of all the stars.\r\nIt is rather more improbable than it would be to affirm that in the\r\nartillery practice of two opposing armies, cannon balls have thousands\r\nof times struck and shattered each other midway between the hostile\r\nbatteries. The question, we are told, is one of great moment to\r\ngeologists, since on the one hypothesis the duration of our system\r\nhas amounted to only about twenty millions of years; on the other,\r\nit may have lasted ten times that number.[5] In any case it seems a\r\nstrange way of making systems of worlds, that they should result from\r\nthe chance collision of multitudes of solid bodies rushing hither\r\nand thither in space, and it is almost equally strange to imagine an\r\nintelligent Creator banging these bodies about like billiard balls in\r\norder to make worlds. Still, in that case we might imagine them not\r\nto be altogether aimless. The question only becomes more complicated\r\nwhen with Grove and Lockyer we try to reach back to an antecedent\r\ncondition, when there are neither solid masses nor nebulæ, but only\r\nan inconceivably tenuous and universally diffused medium made up of an\r\nembryonic matter, which has not yet even resolved itself into chemical\r\nelements. How this could establish any motion within itself tending to\r\naggregation in masses, is quite inconceivable. To plodding geologists\r\nlaboriously collecting facts and framing conclusions therefrom, such\r\nflights of the mathematical mind seem like the wildest fantasies of\r\ndreams. We are glad to turn from them to examine those oldest rocks,\r\nwhich are to us the foundation stones of the earth's crust.\r\n\r\n[4] \"Stellar Evolution.\"\r\n\r\n[5] Other facts favour the shorter time (Clarence King, _Am. Jl. of\r\nScience_, vol. xlv., 3rd series).\r\n\r\nWhat do we know of the oldest and most primitive rocks? At this moment\r\nthe question may be answered in many and discordant ways; yet the\r\nleading elements of the answer may be given very simply. The oldest\r\nrock formation known to geologists is the Lower Laurentian, the\r\nFundamental Gneiss, the Lewisian formation of Scotland, the Ottawa\r\ngneiss of Canada, the lowest Archæan crystalline rocks. This formation,\r\nof enormous thickness, corresponds to what the older geologists called\r\nthe fundamental granite, a name not to be scouted, for gneiss is only a\r\nstratified or laminated granite. Perhaps the main fact in relation to\r\nthis old rock is that it is a gneiss; that is, a rock at once bedded\r\nand crystalline, and having for its dominant ingredient the mineral\r\northoclase, a compound of silica, alumina and potash, in which are\r\nimbedded, as in a paste, grains and crystals of quartz and hornblende.\r\nWe know very well from its texture and composition that it cannot be\r\na product of mere heat, and being a bedded rock we infer that it was\r\nlaid down layer by layer in the manner of aqueous deposits. On the\r\nother hand, its chemical composition is quite different from that\r\nof the muds, sands and gravels usually deposited from water. Their\r\nspecial characters are caused by the fact that they have resulted from\r\nthe slow decay of rocks like these gneisses, under the operation of\r\ncarbon dioxide and water, whereby the alkaline matter and the more\r\nsoluble part of the silica have been washed away, leaving a residue\r\nmainly silicious and aluminous.[6] Such more modern rocks tell of dry\r\nland subjected to atmospheric decay and ram-wash. If they have any\r\ndirect relation to the old gneisses, they are their grandchildren, not\r\ntheir parents. On the contrary, the oldest gneisses show no pebbles or\r\nsand or limestone--nothing to indicate that there was then any land\r\nundergoing atmospheric waste, or shores with sand and gravel. For\r\nall that we know to the contrary, these old gneisses may have been\r\ndeposited in a shoreless sea, holding in solution or suspension merely\r\nwhat it could derive from a submerged crust recently cooled from a\r\nstate of fusion, still thin, and exuding here and there through its\r\nfissures heated waters and volcanic products. This, it may be observed\r\nhere, is just what we have a right to expect, if the earth was once a\r\nheated or fluid mass, and if our oldest Laurentian rocks consist of\r\nthe first beds or layers deposited upon it, perhaps by a heated ocean.\r\nIt has been well said that \"the secret of the earth's hot youth has\r\nbeen well kept.\" But with the help of physical science we can guess at\r\nan originally heat-liquefied ball with denser matter at its centre,\r\nlighter and oxidised matter at its surface. We can imagine a scum or\r\ncrust forming at the surface; and from what we know of the earth's\r\ninterior, nothing is more likely to have constituted that slaggy crust\r\nthan the material of our old gneisses. As to its bedded character,\r\nthis may have arisen in part from the addition of cooling layers\r\nbelow, in part from the action of heated water above, and in part from\r\npressure or tension; while, wherever it cracked or became broken, its\r\ninterstices would be injected with molten matter from beneath. All this\r\nmay be conjecture, but it is based on known facts, and is the only\r\nprobable conjecture. If correct, it would account for the fact that the\r\ngneissic rocks are the lowest and oldest that we reach in every part of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n[6] Carbon dioxide, the great agent in the decay of silicious rocks,\r\nmust then have constituted a very much larger part of the atmosphere\r\nthan at present.\r\n\r\nIn short, the fundamental gneiss of the Lower Laurentian may have\r\nbeen the first rock ever formed; and in any case it is a rock formed\r\nunder conditions which have not since recurred, except locally. It\r\nconstitutes the first and best example of those chemico-physical,\r\naqueous or aqueo-igneous rocks, so characteristic of the earliest\r\nperiod of the earth's history. Viewed in this way the Lower Laurentian\r\ngneiss is probably the oldest kind of rock we shall ever know the limit\r\nto our backward progress, beyond which there remains nothing to the\r\ngeologist except physical hypotheses respecting a cooling incandescent\r\nglobe. For the chemical conditions of these primitive rocks, and what\r\nis known as to their probable origin, I may refer to the writings of\r\nmy friends, the late Dr. Sterry Hunt and Dr. J. G. Bonney, to whom we\r\nowe so much of what is known of the older crystalline rocks[7] as well\r\nas of their literature, and the questions which they raise. My purpose\r\nhere is to sketch the remarkable difference which we meet as we ascend\r\ninto the Middle and Upper Laurentian.\r\n\r\n[7] Hunt, \"Essays on Chemical Geology\"; Bonney, \"Addresses to British\r\nAssociation and Geological Society of London.\"\r\n\r\nIn the next succeeding formation, the middle part of the Laurentian\r\nof Logan, the Grenville series of Canada, we meet with a great and\r\nsignificant change. It is true we have still a predominance of\r\ngneisses which may have been formed in the same manner with those\r\nbelow them; but we find these now associated with great beds of\r\nlimestone and dolomite, which must have been formed by the separation\r\nof calcium and magnesium carbonates from the sea water, either by\r\nchemical precipitation or by the agency of living beings. We have also\r\nquartzite, quartzose gneisses, and even pebble beds, which inform us\r\nof sandbanks and shores. Nay, more, we have beds containing graphite\r\nwhich must be the residue of plants, and iron ores which tell of the\r\ndeoxidation of iron oxide by organic matters. In short, here we have\r\nevidence of new factors in world-building, of land and ocean, of\r\natmospheric decay of rocks, of deoxidizing processes carried on by\r\nvegetable life on the land and in the waters, of limestone-building in\r\nthe sea. To afford material for such rocks, the old Ottawa gneiss must\r\nhave been lifted up into continents and mountain masses by bendings\r\nand foldings of the original crust. Under the slow but sure action of\r\nthe carbon dioxide dissolved in rainwater, its felspar had crumbled\r\ndown in the course of ages. Its potash, soda, lime, magnesia, and part\r\nOf its silica had been washed into the sea, there to enter into new\r\ncombinations and to form new deposits. The crumbling residue of fine\r\nclay and sand had been also washed down into the borders of the ocean,\r\nand had been there deposited in beds. Thus the earth had entered into\r\na new phase, which continues onward through the geological ages; and I\r\nplace in the reader's hands one key for unlocking the mystery of the\r\nworld in affirming that this great change took place, this new era was\r\ninaugurated in the midst of the Laurentian period, the oldest of our\r\ngreat divisions of the earth's geological history.[8]\r\n\r\n[8] I follow the original arrangement of Logan, who first defined this\r\nsuccession in the extensive and excellent exposures of these rocks in\r\nCanada. Elsewhere the subject has often been confused and mixed with\r\nlocal details. The same facts, though sometimes under different names,\r\nare recorded by the geologists of Scandinavia, Britain, and the United\r\nStates, and the acceptance of the conclusions of Nicol and Lapworth has\r\nserved to bring even the rocks of the Highlands of Scotland more into\r\nline with those of Canada.\r\n\r\nWas not this a fit period for the first appearance of life? should we\r\nnot expect it to appear, independently of the evidence of the fact, so\r\nsoon at least as the temperature of the ocean falls sufficiently low\r\nto permit its existence?[9] I do not propose to enter here into that\r\nevidence. This we shall have occasion to consider in the sequel. I\r\nwould merely say here that we should bear in mind that in this latter\r\nhalf of the Lower Laurentian, or if we so choose to style it, Middle\r\nLaurentian period, we have the conditions required for life in the\r\nsea and on the land; and since in other periods we know that life was\r\nalways present when its conditions were present, it is not unreasonable\r\nto look for the earliest traces of life in this formation, in which we\r\nfind, for the first time, the completion of those physical arrangements\r\nwhich make life, in such forms of it as exist in the sea, possible.\r\n\r\n[9] Dana states this at 180°F. for plants and 120° for animals.\r\n\r\nThis is also a proper place to say something of the disputed doctrine\r\nof what is termed metamorphism, or the chemical and molecular changes\r\nwhich old rocks have undergone.\r\n\r\nThe Laurentian rocks are undoubtedly greatly changed from their\r\noriginal state, more especially in the matters of crystallization and\r\nthe formation of disseminated minerals, by the action of heat and\r\nheated water. Sandstones have thus passed into quartzites, clays into\r\nslates and schists, limestones into marbles. So far, metamorphism is\r\nnot a doubtful question; but when theories of metamorphism go so far as\r\nto suppose an actual change of one element for another, they go beyond\r\nthe bounds of chemical credibility; yet such theories of metamorphism\r\nare often boldly advanced and made the basis of important conclusions.\r\nDr. Hunt has happily given the name \"metasomatosis\" to this imaginary\r\nand improbable kind of metamorphism. I would have it to be understood\r\nthat, in speaking of the metamorphism of the older crystalline rocks,\r\nit is not to this metasomatosis that I refer, and that I hold that\r\nrocks which have been produced out of the materials decomposed by\r\natmospheric erosion can never by any process of metamorphism be\r\nrestored to the precise condition of the Laurentian rocks. Thus,\r\nthere is in the older formations a genealogy of rocks, which, in the\r\nabsence of fossils, may be used with some confidence, but which does\r\nnot apply to the more modern deposits, and which gives a validity to\r\nthe use of mineral character in classifying older rocks which does\r\nnot hold for later formations. Still, nothing in geology absolutely\r\nperishes, or is altogether discontinued; and it is probable that,\r\ndown to the present day, the causes which produced the old Laurentian\r\ngneiss may still operate in limited localities. Then, however, they\r\nwere general, not exceptional. It is further to be observed that the\r\nterm gneiss is sometimes of wide and even loose application. Beside the\r\ntypical orthoclase and hornblendic gneiss of the Laurentian, there are\r\nmicaceous, quartzose, garnetiferous and many other kinds of gneiss; and\r\neven gneissose rocks, which hold labradorite or anorthite instead of\r\northoclase, are sometimes, though not accurately, included in the term.\r\n\r\nThe Grenville series, or Middle Laurentian, is succeeded by what Logan\r\nin Canada called the Upper Laurentian, and which other geologists have\r\ncalled the Norite or Norian series. Here we still have our old friends\r\nthe gneisses, but somewhat peculiar in type, and associated with\r\nthem are great beds and masses, rich in lime-felspar, the so-called\r\nlabradorite and anorthite rocks. The precise 'origin of these is\r\nuncertain, but this much seems clear, namely, that they originated in\r\ncircumstances in which the great limestones deposited in the Lower or\r\nMiddle Laurentian were beginning to be employed in the manufacture,\r\nprobably by aqueo-igneous agencies, of lime-felspars. This proves the\r\nNorian rocks to be younger than the Lower Laurentian, and that, as\r\nLogan supposed, considerable earth-movements had occurred between the\r\ntwo, implying lapse of time, while it is also evident that the folding\r\nand crumpling of the Lower Laurentian had led to great outbursts of\r\nigneous matter from below the crust, or from its under part.\r\n\r\nNext to the Laurentian, but probably after an interval, the rocks\r\nof which are yet scarcely known, we have the Huronian of Logan, a\r\nseries much less crystalline and more fragmentary, and affording more\r\nevidence of land elevation and atmospheric and aqueous erosion than\r\nthose preceding it. It has extensive beds of volcanic rock, great\r\nconglomerates, some of them made up of rounded fragments of Laurentian\r\nrocks, and others of quartz pebbles, which must have been the remains\r\nof rocks subjected to very perfect decay. The pure quartz-rocks tell\r\nthe same tale, while slates and limestones speak also of chemical\r\nseparation of the materials of older rocks. The Huronian evidently\r\ntells of previous movements in the Laurentian, and changes which\r\nallowed the Huronian to be deposited along its shores and on the edges\r\nof its beds. Yet the Huronian itself is older than the Palæozoic\r\nseries, and affected by powerful earth-movements at an earlier date.\r\nLife existed in the waters in Huronian times. We have spicules of\r\nsponges in the limestone, and organic markings on the slaty beds; but\r\nthey are few, and their nature is uncertain.\r\n\r\nSucceeding the Huronian, and made up of its _débris_ and that of the\r\nLaurentian, we have the great Cambrian series, that in which we first\r\nfind undoubted evidence of abundant marine life, and which thus forms\r\nthe first chapter in the great Palæozoic book of the early history of\r\nthe world. Here let it be observed we have at least two wide gaps in\r\nour history, marked by the crumpling up, first, of the Laurentian, and\r\nthen of the Huronian beds.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been said, the reader will perhaps not be astonished\r\nthat fierce geological battles have raged over the old crystalline\r\nrocks. By some geologists they are almost entirely explained away,\r\nor referred to igneous action, or to the alteration of ordinary\r\nsediments. Under the treatment of another school they grow to great\r\nseries of Pre-Cambrian rocks, constituting vast systems of formations,\r\ndistinguishable from each other chiefly by differences of mineral\r\ncharacter. Facts and fossils are daily being discovered, by which these\r\ndisputes will ultimately be settled.\r\n\r\nAfter the solitary appearance of Eozoon in the Laurentian, and of a few\r\nuncertain forms in the Huronian, we find ourselves, in the Cambrian,\r\nin the presence of a nearly complete invertebrate fauna of protozoa,\r\npolyps, echinoderms, mollusks and Crustacea, and this not confined to\r\none locality merely, but apparently extended simultaneously throughout\r\nthe ocean, over the whole world. This sudden incoming of animal\r\nlife, along with the subsequent introduction of successive groups of\r\ninvertebrates, and finally of vertebrate animals, furnishes one of\r\nthe greatest unsolved problems of geology, which geologists were wont\r\nto settle by the supposition of successive creations. In the sequel\r\nI shall endeavour to set forth the facts as to this succession, and\r\nthe general principles involved in it, and to show the insufficiency\r\nof certain theories of evolution suggested by biologists to give any\r\nsubstantial aid to the geologist in these questions. At present I\r\npropose merely to notice some of the general principles which should\r\nguide us in studying the development of life in geological time, and\r\nthe causes which have baffled so many attempts to throw light on this\r\nobscure portion of our unsolved problems.\r\n\r\nIt has been urged on the side of rational evolution--and there are both\r\nrational and irrational forms of this many-sided doctrine--that this\r\nhypothesis does not profess to give an explanation of the absolute\r\norigin of life on our planet, or even of the original organization of\r\na single cell, or of a simple mass of protoplasm, living or dead. All\r\nexperimental attempts to produce by synthesis the complex albuminous\r\nsubstances, or to obtain the living from the non-living, have so far\r\nbeen fruitless, and indeed we cannot imagine any process by which such\r\nchanges could be effected. That they have been effected we know, but\r\nthe process employed by their maker is still as mysterious to us as it\r\nprobably was to him who wrote the words:--\"And God said, Let the waters\r\nswarm with swarmers.\" How vast is the gap in our knowledge and our\r\npractical power implied in this admission, which must, however, be made\r\nby every mind not absolutely blinded by a superstitious belief in those\r\nforms of words which too often pass current as philosophy.\r\n\r\nBut if we are content to start with a number of organisms ready made--a\r\nsomewhat humiliating start, however--we still have to ask--How do\r\nthese vary so as to give new species? It is a singular illusion, and\r\nespecially in the case of men who profess to be believers in natural\r\nlaw, that variation may be boundless, aimless and fortuitous, and\r\nthat it is by spontaneous selection from varieties thus produced that\r\ndevelopment arises. But surely the supposition of mere chance and\r\nmagic is unworthy of science. Varieties must have causes, and their\r\ncauses and their effects must be regulated by some law or laws. Now it\r\nis easy to see that they cannot be caused by a mere innate tendency\r\nin the organism itself. Every organism is so nicely equilibrated that\r\nit has no such spontaneous tendency, except within the limits set by\r\nits growth and the law of its periodical changes. There may, however,\r\nbe equilibrium more or less stable. I believe all attempts hitherto\r\nmade have failed to account for the fixity of certain, nay, of very\r\nmany, types throughout geological time, but the mere consideration\r\nthat one may be in a more stable state of equilibrium than another,\r\nso far explains it. A rocking stone has no more spontaneous tendency\r\nto move than an ordinary boulder, but it may be made to move with a\r\ntouch. So it probably is with organisms. But if so, then the causes of\r\nvariation are external, as in many cases we actually know them to be,\r\nand they must depend on instability with change in surroundings, and\r\nthis so arranged as not to be too extreme in amount, and to operate\r\nin some determinate direction. Observe how remarkable the unity of\r\nthe adjustments involved in such a supposition!--how superior they\r\nmust be to our rude and always more or less unsuccessful attempts to\r\nproduce and carry forward varieties and races in definite directions!\r\nThis cannot be chance. If it exists, it must depend on plans deeply\r\nlaid in the nature of things, else it would be most monstrous magic\r\nand causeless miracle. Still more certain is this conclusion when we\r\nconsider the vast and orderly succession made known to us by geology,\r\nand which must have been regulated by fixed laws, only a few of which\r\nare as yet known to us.\r\n\r\nBeyond these general considerations we have others of a more special\r\ncharacter, based on palæontological facts, which show how imperfect are\r\nour attempts as yet to reach the true causes of the introduction of\r\ngenera and species.\r\n\r\nOne is the remarkable fixity of the leading types of living beings\r\nin geological time. If, instead of framing, like Haeckel, fanciful\r\nphylogenies, we take the trouble, with Barrande and Gaudry, to trace\r\nthe forms of life through the period of their existence, each along its\r\nown line, we shall be greatly struck with this, and especially with the\r\ncontinuous existence of many low types of life through vicissitudes of\r\nphysical conditions of the most stupendous character, and over a lapse\r\nof time scarcely conceivable. What is still more remarkable is that\r\nthis holds in groups which, within certain limits, are perhaps the most\r\nvariable of all. In the present world no creatures are individually\r\nmore variable than the protozoa; as, for example, the foraminifera and\r\nthe sponges. Yet these groups are fundamentally the same, from the\r\nbeginning of the Palæozoic until now, and modern species seem scarcely\r\nat all to differ from specimens procured from rocks at least half-way\r\nback to the beginning of our geological record. If we suppose that the\r\npresent sponges and foraminifera are the descendants of those of the\r\nSilurian period, we can affirm that in all that vast lapse of time they\r\nhave, on the whole, made little greater change than that which may be\r\nobserved in variable forms at present. The same remark applies to other\r\nlow animal forms. In types somewhat higher and less variable, this is\r\nalmost equally noteworthy. The pattern of the venation of the wings of\r\ncockroaches, and the structure and form of land snails, gally-worms and\r\ndecapod crustaceans were all settled in the Carboniferous age, in a way\r\nthat still remains. So were the foliage and the fructification of club\r\nmosses and ferns. If, at any time, members of these groups branched\r\noff, so as to lay the foundation of new species, this must have been\r\na very rare and exceptional occurrence, and one demanding even some\r\nsuspension of the ordinary laws of nature.\r\n\r\nWe may perhaps be content on this question to say with Gaudry,[10]\r\nthat it is not yet possible to \"pierce the mystery that surrounds\r\nthe development of the great classes of animals,\" or with Prof.\r\nWilliamson,[11] that in reference to fossil plants \"the time has\r\nnot yet arrived for the appointment of a botanical King-at-arms and\r\nConstructor of pedigrees.\" We shall, however, find that by abandoning\r\nmere hypothetical causes and carefully noting the order of the\r\ndevelopment and the causes in operation, so far as known, we may reach\r\nto ideas as to cause and mode, and the laws of succession, even if\r\nunable to penetrate the mystery of origins.\r\n\r\n[10] \"Enchainements du Monde Animal,\" Paris, 1883.\r\n\r\n[11] Address before Royal Institution, Feb., 1883.\r\n\r\nAnother caution which a palæontologist has occasion to give with regard\r\nto theories of life, has reference to the tendency of biologists to\r\ninfer that animals and plants were introduced under embryonic forms,\r\nand at first in few and imperfect species. Facts do not substantiate\r\nthis. The first appearance of leading types of life is rarely\r\nembryonic, or of the nature of immature individuals. On the contrary,\r\nthey often appear in highly perfect and specialized forms, often,\r\nhowever, of composite type and expressing characters afterwards so\r\nseparated as to belong to higher groups. The trilobites of the Cambrian\r\nare some of them of few segments, and so far embryonic, but the greater\r\npart are many-segmented and very complex. The batrachians of the\r\nCarboniferous present many characters higher than those of their modern\r\nsuccessors and now appropriated to the true reptiles. The reptiles of\r\nthe Permian and Trias usurped some of the prerogatives of the mammals.\r\nThe ferns, lycopods and equisetums of the Devonian and Carboniferous\r\nwere, in fructification, not inferior to their modern representatives,\r\nand in the structure of their stems far superior. The shell-bearing\r\ncephalopods of the Palæozoic would seem to have possessed structures\r\nnow special to a higher group, that of the cuttle-fishes. The bald and\r\ncontemptuous negation of these facts by Haeckel and other biologists\r\ndoes not tend to give geologists much confidence in their dicta.\r\n\r\nAgain, we are now prepared to say that the struggle for existence,\r\nhowever plausible as a theory, when put before us in connection\r\nwith the productiveness of animals and the few survivors of their\r\nmultitudinous progeny, has not been the determining cause of the\r\nintroduction of new species. The periods of rapid introduction\r\nof new forms of marine life were not periods of struggle, but of\r\nexpansion--those periods in which the submergence of continents\r\nafforded new and large space for their extension and comfortable\r\nsubsistence. In like manner, it was continental emergence that afforded\r\nthe opportunity for the introduction of land animals and plants.\r\nFurther, in connection with this, it is now an established conclusion\r\nthat the great aggressive faunas and floras of the continents have\r\noriginated in the north, some of them within the arctic circle, and\r\nthis in periods of exceptional warmth, when the perpetual summer\r\nsunshine of the arctic regions coëxisted with a warm temperature.\r\nThe testimony of the rocks thus is that not struggle but expansion\r\nfurnished the requisite conditions for new forms of life, and that the\r\nperiods of struggle were characterized by depauperation and extinction.\r\n\r\nBut we are sometimes told that organisms are merely mechanical, and\r\nthat the discussions respecting their origin have no significance any\r\nmore than if they related to rocks or crystals, because they relate\r\nmerely to the organism considered as a machine, and not to that which\r\nmay be supposed to be more important, namely, the great determining\r\npower of mind and will. That this is a mere evasion by which we\r\nreally gain nothing, will appear from a characteristic extract of an\r\narticle by an eminent biologist in the new edition of the Encyclopedia\r\nBritannica, a publication which, I am sorry to say, instead of its\r\nproper _rôle_ as a repertory of facts, has admitted partisan papers,\r\nstating extreme and unproved speculations as if they were conclusions\r\nof science. The statement referred to is as follows:--\"A mass of living\r\nprotoplasm is simply a molecular machine of great complexity, the total\r\nresults of the working of which, or its vital phenomena, depend on the\r\none hand on its construction, and on the other, on the energy supplied\r\nto it; and to speak of vitality as anything but the name for a series\r\nof operations is as if one should talk of the horologity of a clock.\"\r\nIt would, I think, scarcely be possible to put into the same number\r\nof words a greater amount of unscientific assumption and unproved\r\nstatement than in this sentence. Is \"living protoplasm\" different in\r\nany way from dead protoplasm, and if so, what causes the difference?\r\nWhat is a \"machine\"? Can we conceive of a self-produced or uncaused\r\nmachine, or one not intended to work out some definite results? The\r\nresults of the machine in question are said to be \"vital phenomena\";\r\ncertainly most wonderful results, and greater than those of any machine\r\nman has yet been able to construct. But why \"vital\"? If there is no\r\nsuch thing as life, surely they are merely physical results. Can\r\nmechanical causes produce other than physical effects? To Aristotle\r\nlife was \"the cause of form in organisms.\" Is not this quite as likely\r\nto be true as the converse proposition? If the vital phenomena depend\r\non the \"construction\" of the machine, and the \"energy supplied to it,\"\r\nwhence this construction and whence this energy? The illustration of\r\nthe clock does not help us to answer this question. The construction of\r\nthe clock depends on its maker, and its energy is derived from the hand\r\nthat winds it up. If we can think of a clock which no one has made, and\r\nwhich no one winds, a clock constructed by chance, set in harmony with\r\nthe universe by chance, wound up periodically by chance, we shall then\r\nhave an idea parallel to that of an organism living, yet without any\r\nvital energy or creative law; but in such a case we should certainly\r\nhave to assume some antecedent cause, whether we call it \"horologity\"\r\nor by some other name. Perhaps the term evolution would serve as well\r\nas any other, were it not that common sense teaches that nothing can be\r\nspontaneously evolved out of that in which it did not previously exist.\r\n\r\nThere is one other unsolved problem in the study of life by the\r\ngeologist to which it is still necessary to advert. This is the\r\ninability of palæontology to fill up the gaps in the chain of being.\r\nIn this respect we are constantly taunted with the imperfection of the\r\nrecord, a matter so important that it merits a separate treatment; but\r\nfacts show that this is much more complete than is generally supposed.\r\nOver long periods of time and many lines of being we have a nearly\r\ncontinuous chain, and if this does not show the tendency desired,\r\nthe fault is as likely to be in the theory as in the record. On the\r\nother hand, the abrupt and simultaneous appearance of new types in\r\nmany specific and generic forms and over wide and separate areas at\r\none and the same time, is too often repeated to be accidental. Hence\r\npalæontologists, in endeavouring to establish evolution, have been\r\nobliged to assume periods of exceptional activity in the introduction\r\nof species, alternating with others of stagnation, a doctrine differing\r\nvery little from that of special creation, as held by the older\r\ngeologists.\r\n\r\nThe attempt has lately been made to account for these breaks by the\r\nassumption that the geological record relates only to periods of\r\nsubmergence, and gives no information as to those of elevation. This\r\nis manifestly untrue. In so far as marine life is concerned, the\r\nperiods of submergence are those in which new forms abound for very\r\nobvious reasons, already hinted; but the periods of new forms of land\r\nand fresh-water life are those of elevation, and these have their own\r\nrecords and monuments, often very rich and ample, as, for example, the\r\nswamps of the Carboniferous, the transition from the great Cretaceous\r\nsubsidence, when so much of the land of the Northern Hemisphere\r\nwas submerged, to the new continents of the Tertiary, the Tertiary\r\nlake-basins of Western America, the Terraces and raised beaches of\r\nthe Pleistocene. Had I time to refer in detail to the breaks in the\r\ncontinuity of life which cannot be explained by the imperfection of the\r\nrecord, I could show at least that nature in this case does advance\r\n_per saltum_--by leaps, rather than by a slow continuous process. Many\r\nable reasoners, as Le Conte, in America, and Mivart and Collard in\r\nEngland, hold this view.\r\n\r\nHere, as elsewhere, a vast amount of steady conscientious work is\r\nrequired to enable us to solve the problems of the history of life. But\r\nif so, the more the hope for the patient student and investigator. I\r\nknow nothing more chilling to research, or unfavourable to progress,\r\nthan the promulgation of a dogmatic decision that there is nothing to\r\nbe learned but a merely fortuitous and uncaused succession, amenable\r\nto no law, and only to be covered, in order to hide its shapeless and\r\nuncertain proportions, by the mantle of bold and gratuitous hypothesis.\r\n\r\nSo soon as we find evidence of continents and oceans we raise the\r\nquestion, Have these continents existed from the first in their present\r\nposition and form, or have the land and water changed places in the\r\ncourse of geological time? This question also deserves a separate and\r\nmore detailed consideration. In reality both statements are true in a\r\ncertain limited sense. On the one hand, any geological map whatever\r\nsuffices to show that the general outline of the existing land began to\r\nbe formed in the first and oldest crumplings of the crust. On the other\r\nhand, the greater part of the surface of the land consists of marine\r\nsediments which must have been deposited when the continents were\r\nin great part submerged, and whose materials must have been derived\r\nfrom land that has perished in the process, while all the continental\r\nsurfaces, except, perhaps, some high peaks and ridges, have been many\r\ntimes submerged. Both of these apparently contradictory statements\r\nare true; and without assuming both, it is impossible to explain the\r\nexisting contours and reliefs of the surface.\r\n\r\nIn exceptional cases even portions of deep sea have been elevated, as\r\nin the case of the Polycistine deposits in the West Indies; but these\r\nexceptions are as yet scarcely sufficient to prove the rule.\r\n\r\nIn the case of North America, the form of the old nucleus of Laurentian\r\nrock in the north already marks out that of the finished continent, and\r\nthe successive later formations have been laid upon the edges of this,\r\nlike the successive loads of earth dumped over an embankment. But in\r\norder to give the great thickness of the Palæozoic sediments, the land\r\nmust have been again and again submerged, and for long periods of time.\r\nThus, in one sense, the continents have been fixed; in another, they\r\nhave been constantly fluctuating. Hall and Dana have well illustrated\r\nthese points in so far as eastern North America is concerned. Prof.\r\nHull of the Geological Survey of Ireland has had the boldness to\r\nreduce the fluctuations of land and water, as evidenced in the British\r\nIslands, to the form of a series of maps intended to show the physical\r\ngeography of each successive period. The attempt is probably premature,\r\nand has been met with much adverse criticism; but there can be no\r\ndoubt that it has an element of truth. When we attempt to calculate\r\nwhat could have been supplied from the old Eozoic nucleus by decay\r\nand aqueous erosion, and when we take into account the greater local\r\nthickness of sediments towards the present sea-basins, we can scarcely\r\navoid the conclusion that extensive areas once occupied by high land\r\nare now under the sea. But to ascertain the precise areas and position\r\nof these perished lands may now be impossible.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact we are obliged to believe in the contemporaneous\r\nexistence in all geological periods, except perhaps the very oldest, of\r\nthree sorts of areas on the surface of the earth: (1) Oceanic areas of\r\ndeep sea, which must always have occupied the bed of the present ocean,\r\nor parts of it; (2) Continental plateaus sometimes existing as low\r\nflats, or as higher table-lands, and sometimes submerged; (3) Areas of\r\nplication or folding, more especially along the borders of the oceans,\r\nforming elevated lands rarely submerged and constantly affording the\r\nmaterial of sedimentary accumulations. We shall find, however, that\r\nthese have changed places in a remarkable manner, though always in such\r\na way that neither the life of the land nor of the waters was wholly\r\nextinguished in the process.\r\n\r\nEvery geologist knows the contention which has been occasioned by the\r\nattempts to correlate the earlier Palæozoic deposits of the Atlantic\r\nmargin of North America with those forming at the same time on the\r\ninterior plateau, and with those of intervening lines of plication and\r\nigneous disturbance. Stratigraphy, lithology and fossils are all more\r\nor less at fault in dealing with these questions, and while the general\r\nnature of the problem is understood by many geologists, its solution\r\nin particular cases is still a source of apparently endless debate.\r\n\r\nThe causes and mode of operation of the great movements of the earth's\r\ncrust which have produced mountains, plains and table-lands, are still\r\ninvolved in some mystery. One patent cause is the unequal settling of\r\nthe crust towards the centre; but it is not so generally understood\r\nas it should be, that the greater settlement of the ocean-bed has\r\nnecessitated its pressure against the sides of the continents in\r\nthe same manner that a huge ice-floe crushes a ship or a pier. The\r\ngeological map of North America shows this at a glance, and impresses\r\nus with the fact that large portions of the earth's crust have not only\r\nbeen folded but bodily pushed back for great distances. On looking at\r\nthe extreme north, we see that the great Laurentian mass of central\r\nNewfoundland has acted as a projecting pier to the space immediately\r\nwest of it, and has caused the gulf of St. Lawrence to remain an\r\nundisturbed area since Palæozoic times. Immediately to the south of\r\nthis, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick are folded back. Still farther\r\nsouth, as Guyot has shown, the old sediments have been crushed in sharp\r\nfolds against the Adirondack mass, which has sheltered the table-land\r\nof the Catskills and of the great lakes. South of this again the rocks\r\nof Pennsylvania and Maryland have been driven back in a great curve\r\nto the west. Movements of this kind on the Pacific coast of America\r\nhave been still more stupendous, as well as more recent. Dr. G. M.\r\nDawson[12] thus refers to the crushing action of the Pacific bed on\r\nthe rocks of British Columbia, and this especially at two periods, the\r\nclose of the Triassic and the close of the Cretaceous: \"The successive\r\nfoldings and crushings which the Cordillera region has suffered have\r\nresulted in an actual change of position of the rocks now composing\r\nits western margin. This change may have amounted since the beginning\r\nof Mesozoic time to one-third of its whole present width, which would\r\nplace the line of the coast ranges about two degrees of longitude\r\nfarther west.\" Here we have evidence that a tract of country 400\r\nmiles wide and consisting largely of mountain ranges and table-lands,\r\nhas been crushed bodily back over two degrees of longitude; and this\r\napplies not to British Columbia merely, but to the whole west coast\r\nfrom Alaska to Chili. Yet we know that any contraction of the earth's\r\nnucleus can crumple up only a very thin superficial crust, which in\r\nthis case must have slid over the pasty mass below.[13] Let it be\r\nobserved, however, that the whole lateral pressure of vast areas\r\nhas been condensed into very narrow lines. Nothing, I think, can\r\nmore forcibly show the enormous pressure to which the edges of the\r\ncontinents have been exposed, and at the same time the great sinking of\r\nthe hard and resisting ocean-beds. Complex and difficult to calculate\r\nthough these movements of plication are, they are more intelligible\r\nthan the apparently regular pulsations of the flat continental areas,\r\nwhereby they have alternately been below and above the waters, and\r\nwhich must have depended on somewhat regularly recurring causes,\r\nconnected either with the secular cooling of the earth or with the\r\ngradual retardation of its rotation, or with both. There is, however,\r\ngood reason to believe that the successive subsidences alternated with\r\nthe movements of plication, and depended on upward bendings of the\r\nocean floor, and also on the gradual slackening of the rotation of the\r\nearth. Throughout these changes, each successive elevation exposed the\r\nrocks for long ages to the decomposing influence of the atmosphere.\r\nEach submergence swept away and deposited as sediment the material\r\naccumulated by decay. Every change of elevation was accompanied with\r\nchanges of climate, and with modifications of the habitats of animals\r\nand plants. Were it possible to restore accurately the physical\r\ngeography of the earth in all these respects, for each geological\r\nperiod, the data for the solution of many difficult questions would be\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\n[12] Trans. Royal Society of Canada, 1890.\r\n\r\n[13] This view is quite consistent with the practical solidity of the\r\nearth, and with the action of local expansion by heat, of settlement of\r\nareas overloaded with sediment, and of downward sliding of beds. This\r\nwe shall see in the sequel.\r\n\r\nWe have wandered through space and time sufficiently for one chapter,\r\nand some of the same topics must come up later in other connections.\r\nLet us sum up in a word. In human history we are dealing with the\r\nshort lives and limited plans of man. In the making of worlds we are\r\nconversant with the plans of a Creator with whom one day is as a\r\nthousand years, and a thousand years as one day. We must not measure\r\nsuch things by our microscopic scale of time. Nor should we fail to\r\nsee that vast though the ages of the earth are, they are parts of a\r\ncontinuous plan, and of a plan probably reaching in space and time\r\nimmeasurably beyond our earth. When we trace the long history from an\r\nincandescent fire-mist to a finished earth, and vast ages occupied by\r\nthe dynasties of plant and animal life, we see not merely a mighty\r\nmaze, an almost endless procession of changes, but that all of these\r\nwere related to one another by a chain of causes and effects leading\r\nonward to greater variety and complexity, while retaining throughout\r\nthe traces of the means employed. The old rocks and the ancient lines\r\nof folding and the perished forms of life are not merely a scaffolding\r\nset up to be thrown down, but the foundation stones of a great and\r\nsymmetrical structure. Is it yet completed? Who can tell? The earth may\r\nstill be young, and infinite ages of a better history may lie before it.\r\n\r\n  References[14]:--Presidential Address to the American Association\r\n    for the Advancement of Science, meeting at Minneapolis, 1883. \"The\r\n    Story of the Earth and Man.\" Ninth edition, London, 1887.\r\n\r\n[14] The references in this and succeeding chapters are exclusively\r\nto papers and works by the author, on which the several chapters are\r\nbased.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n             _THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD._\r\n\r\n                      DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF\r\n\r\n                           JOACHIN BARRANDE,\r\n\r\n                 One of the most successful Labourers\r\n\r\n                   in the Completion of the History\r\n\r\n                    of Life in its earlier Stages.\r\n\r\n\r\nNature of the Imperfection--Questions as to its arising from\r\nWant of Continuity, from Lack of Preservation, from Imperfect\r\nCollecting.--Examples--Land Snails, Carboniferous Batrachians,\r\nPalæozoic Sponges, Pleistocene Shells, Devonian and Carboniferous\r\nPlants--Comparative Perfection in the Case of Marine Shells,\r\netc.--Possible Cambrian Squids--Questions as to Want of First Chapters\r\nof the Record--Practical Conclusions\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cambro-Silurian Sponges restored.--_Protospongia_,\r\n_Acanthodictya_, _Cyathospongia_, _Lasiothrix_, _Halichondrites_,\r\nPalæosaccus, etc., from a single bed of shale in the Quebec Group,\r\nLittle Metis, Canada (p. 47).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_THE IMPERFECTION OF THE GEOLOGICAL RECORD._\r\n\r\n\r\nComplaints of the imperfection of the geological record are rife among\r\nthose biologists who expect to find continuous series of fossils\r\nrepresenting the gradual transmutation of species. No doubt these gaps\r\nare in some cases portentous, and unfortunately they often occur just\r\nwhere it is most essential to certain general conclusions that they\r\nshould be filled up. Instead, however, of making vague lamentations\r\non the subject, it is well to inquire to what causes these gaps may\r\nbe due, to what extent they invalidate the completeness of geological\r\nhistory for scientific purposes, and how they may best be filled.\r\n\r\nHere we may first remark that it is not so much the physical record of\r\ngeology that is imperfect as the organic record. Ever since the time\r\nof Hutton and Playfair we have learned that the processes of mineral\r\ndetrition and deposition are continuous, and have been so throughout\r\ngeological time. The erosion of the land is constantly going on, every\r\nshower carries its tribute of earthy matter toward the sea, and every\r\nwave that strikes against a beach or cliff does some work toward the\r\ngrinding of shells, pebbles or stone. Thus, everywhere around our\r\ncontinents there is a continuous deposition of beds of earthy matter,\r\nand it is this which, when elevated into new land, has given us our\r\nchronological series of geological formations. True, the elevating\r\nprocess is not continuous, but, so far as we know, intermittent; but\r\nit has been so often repeated that we have no reason to doubt that the\r\nwasting continents afford a complete series of aqueous deposits, since\r\nthe time when the dry land first appeared.\r\n\r\nIn recent years the _Challenger_ expedition and similar dredgings have\r\ninformed us of still another continuity of deposition in the depths\r\nof the ocean. There, where no detritus from the land, or only a very\r\nlittle fine volcanic ash or pumice has ever reached, we have, going on\r\nfrom age to age, a deposit of the hard parts of abyssal animals and\r\nof those that swim in the open sea; so that if it were possible to\r\nbore or sink a shaft in some parts of the ocean, we should find not\r\nonly a continuous bed, but a continuous series of pelagic life from\r\nthe Laurentian to the present day. Thus we have continuous physical\r\nrecords, could we but reach or completely put them together, and\r\neliminate the disturbing influence of merely local vicissitudes. It is\r\nwhen we begin to search the geological formations for fossils, that\r\nimperfection in our record first becomes painfully manifest.\r\n\r\nIn the case of many groups of marine animals, as, for example, the\r\nshell-fish and the corals, and I may add the bivalve crustaceans, so\r\nadmirably worked up by my friend Prof. Rupert Jones, we have very\r\ncomplete series. With the and snails the case is altogether different.\r\nAs stated in another paper of this series, a few species of these\r\nanimals appear in the later Palæozoic age, and after that they have no\r\nsuccessors known to us in all the great periods covered by the Permian,\r\nthe Trias, and the earlier Jurassic. A few air-breathing water-snails\r\nappear in the upper Jurassic, and true land snails are not met with\r\nagain until the Tertiary. Were there no land snails in this vast lapse\r\nof time? Have we two successive creations, so to speak, of these\r\ncreatures at distant intervals? Were they only diminished in numbers\r\nand distribution in the intervening time? Is the hiatus owing merely\r\nto the unlikelihood of such shells being preserved? Or is it owing to\r\nthe lack of diligence and care in collecting?\r\n\r\nIn this particular case we are, no doubt, disposed to say that the\r\nseries must have been continuous. But we cannot be sure of this. In\r\nwhatever way a few species of land snails were so early introduced in\r\nthe time of the Devonian or of the Coal formation, if from physical\r\nvicissitudes or lack of proper pabulum they became extinct, there is\r\nno reason known to us why, when circumstances again became favourable,\r\nthey should not be reintroduced in the same manner as at first, whether\r\nby development from allied types or otherwise. The fact that the few\r\nDevonian and Carboniferous species are very like those that still\r\nexist, perhaps makes against this supposition, but does not exclude it.\r\nIf we suppose that new forms of life of low grade are introduced from\r\ntime to time in the course of the geological ages, and if we adopt the\r\nDarwinian hypothesis of evolution, we arrive, as Naegeli has so well\r\npointed out, at the strange paradox, that the highest forms of life\r\nmust be the oldest of all, since they will be the descendants of the\r\nearliest of the lower animals, whereas the animals now of low grade\r\nmay have been introduced later, and may not have had time to improve.\r\nBut all our attempts to reduce nature to one philosophic expression\r\nnecessarily lead to such paradoxes.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the chances of the preservation of land snails\r\nin aqueous deposits are vastly less than those in favour of the\r\npreservation of aquatic species. The first Carboniferous species\r\nfound[15] had been preserved in the very exceptional circumstances\r\nafforded by the existence of hollow trunks of Sigillariæ on the borders\r\nof the Coal formation flats, and the others subsequently found were\r\nin beds no doubt receiving the drainage of neighbouring land areas.\r\nStill it is not uncommon on the modern sea-shore, anywhere near the\r\nmouths of rivers, to find a few fresh-water shells here and there.\r\nThe carbonaceous beds of the Trias, the fossil soils of the Portland\r\nseries, the estuarine Wealden beds would seem to be as favourably\r\nsituated as those of the coal formation for preserving land shells,\r\nthough possibly the flora of the Mesozoic was less suitable for feeding\r\nsuch creatures than that of the Coal period, and they may consequently\r\nhave become few and local. After all, perhaps more diligent collecting\r\nand more numerous collectors might succeed, and may succeed in the\r\nfuture, in filling this and similar gaps.\r\n\r\n[15] _Pupa vetusta_ of the Nova Scotia coal formation.\r\n\r\nIt is a great mistake to suppose that discoveries of this kind are made\r\nby chance. It is only by the careful and painstaking examination of\r\nmuch material that the gaps in the geological record can be filled up,\r\nand I propose in the sequel of this article to note a few instances, in\r\na country where the range of territory is altogether out of proportion\r\nto the number of observers, and which have come within my own knowledge.\r\n\r\nIt was not altogether by accident that Sir C. Lyell and the writer\r\ndiscovered a few reptilian bones and a land-snail in breaking up\r\nportions of the material filling an erect Sigillaria in the South\r\nJoggins coal measures. We were engaged in a deliberate survey of the\r\nsection, to ascertain as far as might be the conditions of accumulation\r\nof coal, and one point which occurred to us was to inquire as to the\r\ncircumstances of preservation of stumps of forest trees in an erect\r\nposition, to trace their roots into the soils on which they stood,\r\nand to ascertain the circumstances in which they had been buried, had\r\ndecayed, and had been filled with mineral matter. It was in questioning\r\nthese erect trees on such subjects and this not without some digging\r\nand hammering that we made the discovery referred to.\r\n\r\nBut we found such remains only in one tree, and they were very\r\nimperfect, and indicated only two species of batrachians and one\r\nland-snail. There the discovery might have rested. But I undertook to\r\nfollow it up. In successive visits to the coast, a large number of\r\ntrees standing in the cliff and reefs, or fallen to the shore, were\r\nbroken up and examined, the result being to discover that, with one\r\nunimportant exception, the productive trees were confined to one of\r\nthe beds at Coal Mine Point, that from which the original specimens\r\nhad been obtained. Attention was accordingly concentrated on this, and\r\nas many as thirty trees were at different times extracted from it, of\r\nwhich rather more than one-half proved more or less productive. By\r\nthese means bones representing about sixty specimens and twelve species\r\nwere extracted, besides numerous remains of land shells, millipedes,\r\nand scorpions. In this way a very complete idea was obtained of the\r\nland life, or at least of the smaller land animals, of this portion\r\nof the coal formation of Nova Scotia. It is not too much to say that\r\nif similar repositories could be found in the succeeding formations,\r\nand properly worked when found, our record of the history of land\r\nquadrupeds might be made very complete.\r\n\r\nWhen in 1855 I changed my residence from Nova Scotia to Montreal,\r\nand so was removed to some distance from the carboniferous rocks\r\nwhich I had been accustomed to study, I naturally felt somewhat out\r\nof place in a Cambro-Silurian district, more especially as my friend\r\nBillings had already almost exhausted its fossils. I found, however,\r\na congenial field in the Pleistocene shell beds; more especially as\r\nI had given some attention to recent marine animals when on the sea\r\ncoast. The very perfect series of Pleistocene deposits in the St.\r\nLawrence valley locally contain marine shells from the bottom of\r\nthe till or boulder clay up to the overlying sands and gravels. The\r\nassemblage was a more boreal one than that on the coast of Nova Scotia,\r\nthough many of the species were the same, and both the climatal and\r\nbathymetrial conditions differed in different parts of the Pleistocene\r\nbeds themselves. The gap in the record here could at that time be\r\nfilled up only by collecting recent shells. In addition to what\r\ncould be obtained by exchanging with naturalists who had collected\r\nin Greenland, Labrador, and Norway, I employed myself, summer after\r\nsummer, in dredging both on the south and north shore of the St.\r\nLawrence, until able at length to discover in a living state, but under\r\ndifferent conditions as to temperature and depth, nearly every species\r\nfound in the beds on the land, from the lower boulder clay to the top\r\nof the formation, and from the sea-level to the beds six hundred feet\r\nhigh on the hills. Not only so: I could ascertain in certain places and\r\nconditions all the peculiar varieties of the species, and the special\r\nmodes of life which they indicated. Thus, in the cases of the Peter\r\nRedpath Museum, and in notes on the Post-pliocene of Canada, the gap\r\nbetween the Modern and the Glacial age was completely filled up in so\r\nfar as Canadian marine species are concerned. The net result was, as I\r\nhave elsewhere stated, that no change other than varietal had occurred.\r\n\r\nIn studying the fossil plants of the Carboniferous, so abundant in\r\nthe fine exposures of the coal formation in Nova Scotia, two defects\r\nstruck me painfully. One was the fragmentary and imperfect state of\r\nthe specimens procurable. Another was the question, What preceded\r\nthese plants in the older rocks? The first of these was to be met only\r\nby thorough exploration. When a fragment of a plant was disclosed it\r\nwas necessary to inquire if more existed in the same bed, and to dig,\r\nor blast away or break up the rock, until some remaining portions\r\nwere disclosed. In this way it has been possible to obtain entire\r\nspecimens of many trees of the Carboniferous; and to such an extent has\r\nthe laborious and somewhat costly process been effectual, that more\r\nspecies of carboniferous trees are probably known in their entire forms\r\nfrom the Coal formations of Nova Scotia than from any other part of\r\nthe world. I have been amused to find that so little are experiences\r\nof this kind known to some of my _confrères_ abroad, that they are\r\ndisposed to look with scepticism on the information obtained by this\r\nlaborious but certain process, and to suppose that they are being\r\npresented with imaginary \"restorations.\" I think it right here to copy\r\na remark of a German botanist, who has felt himself called to criticise\r\nmy work: \"Dawson's description of the genus (_Psilophyton_) rests\r\nchiefly on the impression made on him in his repeated researches,\" etc.\r\n\"He puts us off with an account of the general idea which he has drawn\r\nfrom the study of them.\" This is the remark of a closet naturalist,\r\nwith reference to the kind of work above referred to, which, of course,\r\ncannot be represented in its entirety in figures or hand specimens.[16]\r\n\r\n[16] Solms-Laubach, \"Fossil Botany.\" A pretentious book, which should\r\nnot have been translated into English without thorough revision and\r\ncorrection.\r\n\r\nAs to the precursors of the Carboniferous flora, in default of\r\ninformation already acquired, I proceeded to question the Erian or\r\nDevonian rocks of Canada, in which Sir William Logan had already found\r\nremains of plants which had not, however, been studied or described.\r\nLaboriously coasting along the cliffs of Gaspé and the Baie des\r\nChaleurs, digging into the sandstones of Eastern Maine, and studying\r\nthe plants collected by the New York Survey, I began to find that there\r\nwas a rich Devonian flora, and that, like that of the Carboniferous,\r\nit presented different stages from the base to the summit of the\r\nformation. But here a great advance was made in a somewhat unexpected\r\nway. My then young friends, the late Prof. Hartt and Mr. Matthew, of\r\nSt. John, had found a few remains of plants in the Devonian, or at\r\nleast pre-Carboniferous beds of St. John, which were placed in my\r\nhands for description. They were so novel and curious that inquiry was\r\nstimulated, and these gentlemen, with some friends of similar tastes,\r\nexplored the shales exposed in the reefs near St. John, and when they\r\nfound the more productive beds, broke them up by actual quarrying\r\noperations in such a way that they soon obtained the richest Devonian\r\nplant collections ever known. I think I may truly say that these young\r\nand enthusiastic explorers worked the St. John plant-beds in a manner\r\npreviously unexampled in the world. Their researches were not only thus\r\nrewarded, but incidentally they discovered the first known Devonian\r\ninsects, which could not have been found by a less painstaking process,\r\nand one of them discovered what I believe to be the oldest known\r\nland shell. Still more, their studies led to the separation from the\r\nDevonian beds of the Underlying Cambrian slates, previously confounded\r\nwith them; and this, followed up by the able and earnest work of Mr.\r\nMatthew, has carried back our knowledge of the older rocks in Canada\r\nseveral stages, or as far as the earliest Cambrian previously known in\r\nEurope, but not before fully recognised in America, and has discovered\r\nin these old rocks the precursors of many forms of life not previously\r\ntraced so far back.\r\n\r\nThe moral of these statements of fact is that the imperfections of the\r\nrecord will yield only to patient and painstaking work, and that much\r\nis in the power of local amateurs. I would enforce this last statement\r\nby a reference to a little research, in which I have happened to take\r\npart at a summer resort on the Lower St. Lawrence, at which I have from\r\ntime to time spent a few restful vacation weeks. Little Metis is on the\r\nQuebec Group of Sir William Logan, that peculiar local representative\r\nof the lower part of the Cambro-Silurian and Upper Cambrian formations\r\nwhich stretches along the south side of the St. Lawrence all the way\r\nfrom Quebec to Cape Rosier, near Gaspé, a distance of five hundred\r\nmiles. This great series of rocks is a jumble of deposits belonging\r\nat that early time to the marginal area of what is now the American\r\ncontinent, and indicating the action not merely of ordinary causes\r\nof aqueous deposit, but of violent volcanic ejections, accompanied\r\nperhaps by earthquake waves, and not improbably by the action of heavy\r\ncoast ice. The result is that mud rocks now in the form of black, grey,\r\nand red shales and slates alternate with thick and irregular beds of\r\nhard sandstone, sometimes so coarse that it resembles the angular\r\n_débris_ of the first treatment of quartz in a crusher. With these\r\nsandstones are thick and still more irregular conglomerates formed of\r\npebbles and boulders of all sizes, up to several feet in diameter, some\r\nof which are of older limestones containing Cambrian fossils, while\r\nothers are of quartzite or of igneous or volcanic rocks.\r\n\r\nThe whole formation, as presented at Metis, is of the most unpromising\r\ncharacter as regards fossils, and after visiting the place for ten\r\nyears, and taking many long walks along the shore and into the\r\ninterior, and scrutinising every exposure, I had found nothing more\r\ninteresting than a few fragments of graptolites, little zoophytes,\r\nancient representatives of our sea mosses, and which are quite\r\ncharacteristic of several portions of the Quebec Group. With these were\r\nsome marks of fucoids and tracks or burrows of worms. The explorers of\r\nthe Geological Survey had been equally unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nQuite accidentally a new light broke upon these unpromising rocks.\r\nMy friend, Dr. Harrington, strolling one day on the shore, sat down\r\nto rest on a stone, and picked up a piece of black slate lying at\r\nhis feet. He noticed on it some faintly traced lines which seemed\r\npeculiar. He put it in his pocket and showed it to me. On examination\r\nwith a lens it proved to have on it a few spicules of a hexactinellid\r\nsponge--little crosses forming a sort of mesh or lattice-work similar\r\nto that which Salter had many years before found in the Cambrian\r\nrocks of Wales, and had named _Protospongia_--the first sponge. The\r\ndiscovery seemed worth following up, and we took an early opportunity\r\nof proceeding to the place, where, after some search, we succeeded in\r\ntracing the loose pieces to a ledge of shale on the beach, where there\r\nwas a little band, only about an inch thick, stored with remains of\r\nsponges, a small bivalve shell and a slender branching seaweed. This\r\nwas one small layer in reefs of slate more than one hundred feet thick.\r\nWe subsequently found two other thin layers, but less productive.\r\nTools and workmen were procured, and we proceeded to quarry in the\r\nreef, taking out at low tide as large slabs as possible of the most\r\nproductive layer, and carefully splitting these up. The results, as\r\npublished in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada,[17]\r\nshow more than twelve species of siliceous sponges belonging to six\r\ngenera, besides fragments indicating other species, and all of these\r\nliving at one time on a very limited space of what is practically a\r\nsingle surface of muddy sea-bottom.[18] The specimens show the parts\r\nof these ancient sponges much more perfectly than they were previously\r\nknown, and indeed, enable many of them to be perfectly restored. They\r\nfor the first time connect the modern siliceous sponges of the deep\r\nsea with those that flourished on the old sea-bottom of the early\r\nCambro-Silurian, and thus bridge over a great, gap in the history of\r\nthis low form of life, showing that the principles of construction\r\nembodied in the remarkable and beautiful siliceous sponges, like\r\nEuplectella, the \"Venus flower-basket,\" now dredged from the deep sea,\r\nwere already perfectly carried out in this far-back beginning of life.\r\nThis little discovery further indicates that portions of the older\r\nPalæozoic sea-bottoms were as well stored with a varied sponge life\r\nas those of any part of the modern ocean. I figure[19] a number of\r\nspecies, remains of all of which may be gathered from a few yards of a\r\nsingle surface at Little Metis. The multitude of interesting details\r\nembodied in all this it is impossible to enter into here, but may be\r\njudged of from the forms reproduced. These examples tend to show that\r\nthe imperfection of the record may not depend on the record itself, but\r\non the incompleteness of our work. We must make large allowance for\r\nimperfect collecting, and especially for the too prevalent habit of\r\nremaining content with few and incomplete specimens, and of grudging\r\nthe time and labour necessary to explore thoroughly the contents of\r\nspecial beds, and to work out all the parts of forms found more or less\r\nin fragments.\r\n\r\n[17] Additional collections made in 1892 show two or three additional\r\nspecies, one of them the type of a new and remarkable genus.\r\n\r\n[18] 1889, section iv. p. 39.\r\n\r\n[19] Frontispiece to chapter.\r\n\r\nThe point of all this at present is that patient work is needed to fill\r\nup the breaks in our record. A collector passing along the shore at\r\nMetis might have picked up a fragment of a fossil sponge, and recorded\r\nit as a fossil, or possibly described the fragment. This fact alone\r\nwould have been valuable, but to make it bear its full fruit it was\r\nnecessary to trace the fragment to its source, and then to spend time\r\nand labour in extracting from the stubborn rock the story it had to\r\ntell. Instances of this kind crowd on my memory as coming within my own\r\nexperience and observation. It is hopeful to think that the record is\r\ndaily becoming less imperfect; it is stimulating to know that so much\r\nis only waiting for investigation. The history never can be absolutely\r\ncomplete. Practically, to us it is infinite. Yet every series of facts\r\nknown may be complete in itself for certain purposes, however many gaps\r\nthere may be in the story. Even if we cannot find a continuous series\r\nbetween the snails of the Coal formation or the sponges of the Quebec\r\nGroup and their successors to-day, we can at least see that they are\r\nidentical in plan and structure, and can note the differences of detail\r\nwhich fitted them for their places in the ancient or the modern world.\r\nNor need we be too discontented if the order of succession, such as\r\nit is, does not exactly square with some theories we may have formed.\r\nPerhaps it may in the end lead us to greater and better truths.\r\n\r\nAnother subject which merits attention here is the evidence which mere\r\nmarkings or other indications may sometimes give as to the existence\r\nof unknown creatures, and thus may be as important to us as the\r\nfootprints of Friday to Robinson Crusoe. As I have been taking Canadian\r\nexamples, I may borrow one here from Mr. Matthew, of St. John, New\r\nBrunswick.\r\n\r\nHe remarks in one of his papers the manner in which the Trilobites\r\nof the early Cambrian are protected with defensive spines, and asks\r\nagainst what enemies they were intended to guard. That there were\r\nenemies is further proved by the occurrence of Coprolites or masses\r\nof excrement, oval or cylindrical in form, and containing fragments\r\nof shells of Trilobites, of Pteropods (Hyolithes) and of Lingula.\r\nThere must therefore have been marine animals of considerable size,\r\nwhich preyed on Trilobites. Dr. Hunt and myself have recorded similar\r\nfacts from the Upper Cambrian and Cambro-Silurian of the Province of\r\nQuebec. No remains, however, are known of animals which could have\r\nproduced such coprolites, except, indeed, some of the larger worms of\r\nthe period, and they seem scarcely large enough. In these circumstances\r\nMr. Matthew falls back on certain curious marks or scratches with\r\nwhich large surfaces of these old rocks are covered, and which he\r\nnames Ctenichnites or \"Comb tracks.\" These markings seem to indicate\r\nthe rapid motion of some animal touching the bottom with fins or other\r\norgans; and as we know no fishes in these old rocks, the question\r\nrecurs, What could it have been? From the form and character of the\r\nmarkings Mr. Matthew infers (1) That these animals lived in \"schools,\"\r\nor were social in their habits; (2) That they had a rapid, direct,\r\ndarting motion; (3) That they had three or four (at least) flexible\r\narms; (4) That these arms were furnished with hooks or spines; (5)\r\nThat the creatures swam with an easy motion, so that sometimes the\r\narms of one side touched the bottom, sometimes those of the other.\r\nThese indications point to animals allied to the modern squids or\r\ncuttle-fishes, and as these animals may have had no hard parts capable\r\nof preservation, except their horny beaks, nothing might remain to\r\nindicate their presence except these marks on the bottom. Mr. Matthew\r\ntherefore conjectures that there may have been large cuttle-fishes in\r\nthe Cambrian. Since, however, these are animals of very high rank in\r\ntheir class, and are not certainly known to us till a very much later\r\nperiod, their occurrence in these old rocks would be a very remarkable\r\nand unexpected fact.\r\n\r\nA discovery made by Walcott in the Western States since Mr. Matthew's\r\npaper was written, throws fresh light on the question. Remains of\r\nfishes have been found by the former in the Cambro Silurian rocks\r\nnearly as far back as Mr. Matthew's comb-tracks. Besides this, Pander\r\nin Russia has found in these old rocks curious teeth, which he refers\r\nconjecturally to fishes (Conodonts). Why may there not have been in\r\nthe Cambrian large fishes having, like the modern sharks, cartilage or\r\ngristle instead of bone--perhaps destitute of scales, and with small\r\nteeth which have not yet been detected. The fin rays of such fishes may\r\nhave left the comb tracks, and in support of this I may say that there\r\nare in the Lower Carboniferous of Horton Bluff, in Nova Scotia, very\r\nsimilar tracks in beds holding many remains of fishes. Whichever view\r\nwe adopt we see good evidence that there were in the early Cambrian\r\nanimals of higher grade than we have yet dreamt of. Observe, however,\r\nthat if we could complete the record in this point it would only give\r\nus higher forms of life at an earlier time, and so push farther back\r\ntheir possible development from lower forms. I fear, indeed, that I\r\ncan hold out little hopes to the evolutionists that a more complete\r\ngeological record would help them in any way. It would possibly only\r\nrender their position more difficult.\r\n\r\nBut the saddest of all the possible defects of the geological record\r\nis that it may want the beginning, and be like the Bible of some of\r\nthe German historical critics, from which they eliminate as mythical\r\neverything before the time of the later Hebrew kings. Our attention is\r\nforcibly called to this by the condition of the fauna of the earliest\r\nCambrian rocks. The discoveries in these in Wales, in Norway, and in\r\nAmerica show us that the seas of this early period swarmed with animals\r\nrepresenting all the great types of invertebrate marine life. We have\r\nhere highly organized Crustaceans, Worms, Mollusks and other creatures\r\nwhich show us that in that early age all these distinct forms of life\r\nwere as well separated from each other as in later times, that eyes\r\nof different types, jointed limbs with nerves and muscles, and a vast\r\nvariety of anatomical contrivances were as highly developed as at any\r\nsubsequent time.[20] To a Darwinian evolutionist this means nothing\r\nless than that these creatures must have existed through countless ages\r\nof development from their imagined simple ancestral form or forms how\r\nlong it is impossible to guess, since, unless change was more speedy\r\nin the infancy of the earth, the term of ages required must have far\r\nexceeded that from the Cambrian to the Modern. Yet, to represent all\r\nthis we have absolutely nothing except Eozoon in its solitary grandeur,\r\nand a few other forms, possibly of Protozoa and worms. An imaginary\r\nphylogeny of animal life from Monads to Trilobites would be something\r\nas long as the whole geological history. Yet it would be almost wholly\r\nimaginary, for the record of the rocks tells little or nothing. In face\r\nof such an imperfection as this, geologists should surely be humble,\r\nand make confession of ignorance to any extent that may be desired. Yet\r\nwe may at least, with all humility and self-abasement, ask our critics\r\nhow they know that this great blank really exists, and whether it may\r\nnot be possible that the swarming life of the early Cambrian may, after\r\nall, have appeared suddenly on the stage in some way as yet unknown to\r\nus and to them.\r\n\r\n[20] Walcott and Matthew record more than 160 species of 67 genera,\r\nincluding Sponges, Zoophytes, Echinoderms, Brachiopods, Bivalve and\r\nUnivalve shellfishes, Trilobites and other Crustaceans from the Lower\r\nCambrian of the United States of America and Canada alone; and these\r\nare but a portion of the inhabitants of the early Cambrian seas. There\r\nis a rich Scandinavian fauna of the same early date, and in England and\r\nWales, Sailer, Hicks and Lapworth have described many fossils of the\r\nbasal Cambrian. From year to year, also, discoveries of fossil remains\r\nare being made, both in America and Europe, in beds of older date than\r\nthose previously known to be fossiliferous. At present, however, these\r\nremains are still few and imperfectly known, and it is not in all\r\ncases certain whether the beds in which they occur are pre-Cambrian or\r\nbelong to the lowest members of that great system. It is unfortunate\r\nthat so many of the strata between the Laurentian and the Cambrian seem\r\nto be of a character little likely to contain fossils; being littoral\r\ndeposits produced in times of much physical disturbance. Yet there must\r\nhave been contemporaneous beds of a different character, which may yet\r\nbe discovered.\r\n\r\n  References:--\"Fossil Sponges from the Quebec Group of Little Metis,\r\n    Lower St. Lawrence\": _Transactions Royal Society of Canada_,\r\n    1890. \"Rèsumè of the Carboniferous Land Shells of North America\":\r\n    _American Journal of Science_, 1880. \"Burrows and Tracks of\r\n    Invertebrate Animals\": _Journal Geological Society of London_,\r\n    1890. \"Notes on the Pleistocene of Canada\": _Canadian Naturalist_,\r\n    1876. \"Air-breathers of the Coal Period \": _Ibid._, 1863.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 _THE HISTORY OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC._\r\n\r\n                      DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF\r\n\r\n                    PROF.

I had the further pleasure of being his successor at the\r\nmeeting in the same place, in 1886; and the subject of this chapter\r\nis that to which I directed the attention of the Association in my\r\nPresidential address. I fear it is a feeble and imperfect utterance\r\ncompared with that which might have been given forth by any of the\r\ngreat men present in 1865, and who have since left us, could they have\r\nspoken with the added knowledge of the intervening twenty years.\r\n\r\nThe geological history of the Atlantic appeared to be a suitable\r\nsubject for a trans-Atlantic president, and to a Society which had\r\nvindicated its claim to be British in the widest sense by holding a\r\nmeeting in Canada, while it was also meditating a visit to Australia--a\r\nvisit not yet accomplished, but in which it may now meet with a worthy\r\ndaughter in the Australian Association formed since the meeting of\r\n1886. The subject is also one carrying our thoughts very far back in\r\ngeological time, and connecting itself with some of the latest and most\r\nimportant discussions and discoveries in the science of the earth,\r\nfurnishing, indeed, too many salient points to be profitably occupied\r\nin a single chapter.\r\n\r\nIf we imagine an observer contemplating the earth from a convenient\r\ndistance in space, and scrutinizing its features as it rolls\r\nbefore him, we may suppose him to be struck with the fact that\r\neleven-sixteenths of its surface are covered with water, and that the\r\nland is so unequally distributed that from one point of view he would\r\nsee a hemisphere almost exclusively oceanic, while nearly the whole of\r\nthe dry land is gathered in the opposite hemisphere. He might observe\r\nthat large portions of the great oceanic areas of the Pacific and\r\nAntarctic Oceans are dotted with islands--like a shallow pool with\r\nstones rising above its surface--as if the general depth were small\r\nin comparison with the area. Other portions of these oceans he might\r\ninfer, from the colour of the water and the absence of islands, cover\r\ndeep depressions in the earth's surface. He might also notice that a\r\nmass or belt of land surrounds each pole, and that the northern ring\r\nsends off to the southward three vast tongues of land and of mountain\r\nchains, terminating respectively in South America, South Africa, and\r\nAustralia, towards which feebler and insular processes are given off\r\nby the antarctic continental mass. This, as some geographers have\r\nobserved,[21] gives a rudely three-ribbed aspect to the earth, though\r\ntwo of the ribs are crowded together, and form the Eurasian mass or\r\ndouble continent, while the third is isolated in the single continent\r\nof America. He might also observe that the northern girdle is cut\r\nacross, so that the Atlantic opens by a wide space into the Arctic Sea,\r\nwhile the Pacific is contracted toward the north, but confluent with\r\nthe Antarctic Ocean. The Atlantic is also relatively deeper and less\r\ncumbered with islands than the Pacific, which has the highest ridges\r\nnear its shores, constituting what some visitors to the Pacific coast\r\nof America have not inaptly called the \"back of the world,\" while the\r\nwider slopes face the narrower ocean. The Pacific and Atlantic, though\r\nboth depressions or flattenings of the earth, are, as we shall find,\r\ndifferent in age, character, and conditions; and the Atlantic, though\r\nthe smaller, is the older, and, from the geological point of view, in\r\nsome respects, the more important of the two; while, by virtue of its\r\nlower borders and gentler slope, it is, though the smaller basin, the\r\nrecipient of the greater rivers, and of a proportionately great amount\r\nof the drainage of the land.[22]\r\n\r\n[21] Dana, \"Manual of Geology,\" introductory part. Green, \"Vestiges of\r\na Molten Globe,\" has summed up these facts.\r\n\r\n[22] Mr. Mellard Reade, in two Presidential addresses before the\r\nGeological Society of Liverpool, has illustrated this point and its\r\ngeological consequences.\r\n\r\nIf our imaginary observer had the means of knowing anything of the\r\nrock formations of the continents, he would notice that those bounding\r\nthe North Atlantic are, in general, of great age some belonging to\r\nthe Laurentian system. On the other hand, he would see that many of\r\nthe mountain ranges along the Pacific are comparatively new, and that\r\nmodern igneous action occurs in connection with them. Thus he might see\r\nin the Atlantic, though comparatively narrow, a more ancient feature of\r\nthe earth's surface; while the Pacific belongs to more modern times.\r\nBut he would note, in connection with this, that the oldest rocks of\r\nthe great continental masses are mostly toward their northern ends;\r\nand that the borders of the northern ring of land, and certain ridges\r\nextending southward from it, constitute the most ancient and permanent\r\nelevations of the earth's crust, though now greatly surpassed by\r\nmountains of more recent age nearer the equator, so that the continents\r\nof the northern hemisphere seem to have grown progressively from north\r\nto south.\r\n\r\nIf the attention of our observer were directed to more modern\r\nprocesses, he might notice that while the antarctic continent freely\r\ndischarges its burden of ice to the ocean north of it, the arctic ice\r\nhas fewer outlets, and that it mainly discharges itself through the\r\nNorth Atlantic, where also the great mass of Greenland stands as a huge\r\ncondenser and cooler, unexampled elsewhere in the world, throwing\r\nevery spring an immense quantity of ice into the North Atlantic, and\r\nmore especially into its western part. On the other hand, he might\r\nlearn from the driftage of weed and the colour of the water, that the\r\npresent great continuous extension and form of the American continent\r\ntend to throw northward a powerful branch of the equatorial current,\r\nwhich, revolving around the North Atlantic, counteracts the great flow\r\nof ice which otherwise would condemn it to a perpetual winter.\r\n\r\nFurther, such an observer would not fail to notice that the ridges\r\nwhich lie along the edges of the oceans and the ebullitions of igneous\r\nmatter which proceed, or have proceeded from them, are consequences\r\nof the settling downward of the great oceanic depressions, a settling\r\never intensified by their receiving more and more of deposit on their\r\nsurfaces; and that this squeezing upward of the borders of these\r\ndepressions into folds has been followed or alternated with elevations\r\nand depressions without any such folding, and proceeding from other\r\ncauses. On the whole, it would be apparent that these actions are more\r\nvigorous now at the margins of the Pacific area, while the Atlantic is\r\nbacked by very old foldings, or by plains and slopes from which it has,\r\nso to speak, dried away without any internal movement. Thus it would\r\nappear that the Pacific is the great centre of earth-movement, while\r\nthe Atlantic trench is the more potent regulator of temperature, and\r\nthe ocean most likely to be severely affected in this respect by small\r\nchanges of its neighbouring land. Last of all, an observer, such as I\r\nhave supposed, would see that the oceans are the producers of moisture\r\nand the conveyors of heat to the northern regions of the world, and\r\nthat in this respect and in the immense condensation and delivery of\r\nice at its north end, the Atlantic is by far the more active, though\r\nthe smaller of the two.\r\n\r\nSo much could be learned by an extra-mundane observer; but unless he\r\nhad also enjoyed opportunities of studying the rocks of the earth in\r\ndetail and close at hand, or had been favoured by some mundane friend\r\nwith a perusal of \"Lyell's Elements,\" or \"Dana's Manual,\" he would not\r\nbe able to appreciate as we can the changes which the Atlantic has seen\r\nin geological time, and in which it has been a main factor. Nor could\r\nhe learn from such superficial observation certain secrets of the deep\r\nsea, which have been unveiled by the sounding lead, the inequalities of\r\nthe ocean basin, its few profound depths, like inverted mountains or\r\ntable-lands, its vast nearly flat abyssmal floor, and the sudden rise\r\nof this to the hundred fathom line, forming a terrace or shelf around\r\nthe sides of the continents. These features, roughly represented in the\r\nmap prefixed, he would be unable to perceive.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this broad survey, we may make one further remark. An\r\nobserver, looking at the earth from without, would notice that the\r\nmargins of the Atlantic and the main lines of direction of its mountain\r\nchains are north-east and south-west, and north-west and south-east, as\r\nif some early causes had determined the occurrence of elevations along\r\ngreat circles of the earth's surface tangent to the polar circles.\r\n\r\nWe are invited by the preceding general glance at the surface of the\r\nearth to ask certain questions respecting the Atlantic, (1) What has\r\nat first determined its position and form? (2) What changes has it\r\nexperienced in the lapse of geological time? (3) What relations have\r\nthese changes borne to the development of life on the land and in the\r\nwater? (4) What is its probable future?\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to answer these questions, which I shall not take\r\nup formally in succession, but rather in connection with each other,\r\nit is necessary to state, as briefly as possible, certain general\r\nconclusions respecting the interior of the earth. It is popularly\r\nsupposed that we know nothing of this beyond a superficial crust\r\nperhaps averaging 50,000 to 100,000 feet in thickness. It is true we\r\nhave no means of exploration in the earth's interior, but the conjoined\r\nlabours of physicists have now proceeded sufficiently far to throw\r\nmuch inferential light on the subject, and to enable us to make some\r\ngeneral affirmations with certainty; and these it is the more necessary\r\nto state distinctly, since they are often treated as mere subjects of\r\nspeculation and fruitless discussion.\r\n\r\n(1) Since the dawn of geological science, it has been evident that the\r\ncrust on which we live must be supported on a plastic or partially\r\nliquid mass of heated rock, approximately uniform in quality under\r\nthe whole of its area. This is a legitimate conclusion from the\r\nwide distribution of volcanic phenomena, and from the fact that the\r\nejections of volcanoes, while locally of various kinds, are similar in\r\nevery part of the world. It led to the old idea of a fluid interior of\r\nthe earth, but this seems now generally abandoned, and this interior\r\nheated and plastic layer is regarded as merely an under-crust, resting\r\non a solid nucleus.[23]\r\n\r\n[23] I do not propose to express any definite opinion as to this\r\nquestion, as either conclusion will satisfy the demands of geology. It\r\nwould seem, however, that astronomers now admit a slight periodical\r\ndeformation of the crust. See Lord Kelvin's Anniversary Address to\r\nRoyal Society, 1892.\r\n\r\n(2) We have reason to believe, as the result of astronomical\r\ninvestigations,[24] that, notwithstanding the plasticity or liquidity\r\nof the under-crust, the mass of the earth--its nucleus as we may call\r\nit--is practically solid and of great density and hardness. Thus we\r\nhave the apparent paradox of a solid yet fluid earth; solid in its\r\nastronomical relations, liquid or plastic for the purposes of volcanic\r\naction and superficial movements.\r\n\r\n[24] Hopkins, Mallet, Lord Kelvin, and Prof. G. H. Darwin maintain\r\nthe solidity and rigidity of the earth on astronomical grounds; but\r\ndifferent conclusions have been reached by Fisher, Hennesey, Delaunay,\r\nand Airy. In America, Hunt, Barnard and Crosby, Button, Le Conte and\r\nWadsworth have discussed these questions. Bonney has suggested that a\r\nmass may be slowly mobile under long-continued pressure, while rigid\r\nwith reference to more sudden movements.\r\n\r\n(3) The plastic sub-crust is not in a state of dry igneous fusion, but\r\nin that condition of aqueo-igneous or hydrothermic fusion which arises\r\nfrom the action of heat on moist substances, and which may either\r\nbe regarded as a fusion or as a species of solution at a very high\r\ntemperature. This we learn from the phenomena of volcanic action, and\r\nfrom the composition of the volcanic and plutonic rocks, as well as\r\nfrom such chemical experiments as those of Daubrée, and of Tilden, and\r\nShenstone.[25] It follows that water or steam, as well as rocky matter,\r\nmay be ejected from the under-crust.\r\n\r\n[25] _Phil. Trans._, 1884. Also Crosby in _Proc. Boston Soc. Nat.\r\nHist._, 1883.\r\n\r\n(4) The interior sub-crust is not perfectly homogeneous, but may be\r\nroughly divided into two layers or magmas, as they have been called;\r\nan upper, highly silicious or acidic, of low specific gravity and\r\nlight-coloured, and corresponding to such kinds of plutonic and\r\nvolcanic rocks as granite and trachyte; and a lower, less silicious\r\nor more basic, more dense, and more highly charged with iron, and\r\ncorresponding to such igneous rocks as the dolerites, basalts, and\r\nkindred lavas. It is interesting here to note that this conclusion,\r\nelaborated by Durocher and Von Waltershausen, and usually connected\r\nwith their names, appears to have been first announced by John\r\nPhillips, in his \"Geological Manual,\" and as a mere common sense\r\ndeduction from the observed phenomena of volcanic action and the\r\nprobable results of the gradual cooling of the earth. It receives\r\nstriking confirmation from the observed succession of acidic and basic\r\nvolcanic rocks of all geological periods and in all localities. It\r\nwould even seem, from recent spectroscopic investigations of Lockyer,\r\nthat there is evidence of a similar succession of magmas in the\r\nheavenly bodies, and the discovery by Nordenskiöld of native iron in\r\nGreenland basalts, affords a probability that the inner magma is in\r\npart metallic, and possibly, that vast masses of unoxidised metals\r\nexist in the central portion of the earth.\r\n\r\n(5) Where rents or fissures form in the upper crust, the material of\r\nthe lower crust is forced upward by the pressure of the less supported\r\nportions of the former, giving rise to volcanic phenomena either of\r\nan explosive or quiet character, as may be determined by contact with\r\nwater. The underlying material may also be carried to the surface by\r\nthe agency of heated water, producing those quiet discharges which Hunt\r\nhas named crenitic. It is to be observed here that explosive volcanic\r\nphenomena, and the formation of cones, are, as Prestwich has well\r\nremarked, characteristic of an old and thickened crust; quiet ejection\r\nfrom fissures and hydro-thermal action may have been more common in\r\nearlier periods and with a thinner over-crust This is an important\r\nconsideration with reference to those earlier ages referred to in\r\nchapter second.\r\n\r\n(6) The contraction of the earth's interior by cooling and by the\r\nemission of material from below the over-crust, has caused this crust\r\nto press downward, and therefore laterally, and so to effect great\r\nbends, folds, and plications; and these, modified subsequently by\r\nsurface denudation, and the piling of sediments on portions of the\r\ncrust, constitute mountain chains and continental plateaus. As Hall\r\nlong ago pointed out,[26] such lines of folding have been produced more\r\nespecially where thick sediments had been laid down on the sea-bottom,\r\nand where, in consequence, internal expansion of the crust had occurred\r\nfrom heating below. Thus we have here another apparent paradox, namely,\r\nthat the elevations of the earth's crust occur in the places where the\r\ngreatest burden of detritus has been laid down upon it, and where,\r\nconsequently, the crust has been softened and depressed. We must\r\nbeware, in this connection, of exaggerated notions of the extent of\r\ncontraction and of crumpling required to form mountains. Bonney has\r\nwell shown, in lectures delivered at the London Institution, that an\r\namount of contraction, almost inappreciable in comparison with the\r\ndiameter of the earth, would be sufficient; and that, as the greatest\r\nmountain chains are less than 1/600th of the earth's radius in height,\r\nthey would, on an artificial globe a foot in diameter, be no more\r\nimportant than the slight inequalities that might result from the\r\npaper gores overlapping each other at the edges. This thinness of the\r\ncrushed crust agrees with the deductions of physical science as to\r\nthe shallowness of the superficial layer of compression in a cooling\r\nglobe. It is perhaps not more than five miles in thickness. A singular\r\nproof of this is seen by the extension of straight cracks filled with\r\nvolcanic rock in the Laurentian districts of Canada.[27] The beds of\r\ngneiss and associated rocks are folded and crumpled in a most complex\r\nmanner, yet they are crossed by these faults, as a crack in a board\r\nmay tear a sheet of paper or a thin veneer glued on it. We thus see\r\nthat the crumpled Laurentian crust was very thin, while the uncrushed\r\nsub-crust determined the line of fracture.\r\n\r\n[26] Hall (American Association Address, 1857, subsequently\r\nrepublished, with additions, as \"Contributions to the Geological\r\nHistory of the American Continent\"), Mallet, Rogers, Dana, La Conte,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[27] As, for instance, the great dyke running nearly in a straight line\r\nfrom near St. Jerome along the Ottawa to Templeton, on the Ottawa, and\r\nbeyond, a distance of more than a hundred miles.\r\n\r\n(7) The crushing and sliding of the over-crust implied in these\r\nmovements raise some serious questions of a physical character. One\r\nof these relates to the rapidity or slowness of such movements,\r\nand the consequent degree of intensity of the heat developed, as a\r\npossible cause of metamorphism of rocks. Another has reference to\r\nthe possibility of changes in the equilibrium of the earth itself,\r\nas resulting from local collapse and ridging. These questions in\r\nconnection with the present dissociation of the axis of rotation\r\nfrom the magnetic poles, and with changes of climate, have attracted\r\nsome attention,[28] and probably deserve further consideration on the\r\npart of physicists. In so far as geological evidence is concerned, it\r\nwould seem that the general association of crumpling with metamorphism\r\nindicates a certain rapidity in the process of mountain-making, and\r\nconsequent development of heat; and the arrangement of the older rocks\r\naround the Arctic basin forbids us from assuming any extensive movement\r\nof the axis of rotation, though it does not exclude changes to a\r\nlimited extent.\r\n\r\n[28] See recent papers of Oldham and Fisher, in _Geological Magazine_,\r\nand _Philosophical Magazine_, July, 1886. Also Péroche, \"Revol.\r\nPolaires.\" Paris, 1886.\r\n\r\n(8) It appears from the above that mountains and continental elevations\r\nmay be of three kinds, (_a_) They may consist of material thrown out\r\nof volcanic rents, like earth out of a mole burrow. Mountains like\r\nVesuvius and Ætna are of this kind. (_b_) They may be parts of wide\r\nridges or chains variously cut and modified by rains and rivers. The\r\nLebanon and the Catskill Mountains are cases in point, (_c_) They may\r\nbe lines of crumpling by lateral pressure. The greatest mountains,\r\nlike the Cordillera, the Alps, and the Appalachians are of this kind,\r\nand such mountains may represent lateral pressure occurring at various\r\ntimes, and whose results have been greatly modified subsequently.\r\n\r\nI wish to formulate these principles as distinctly as possible, and as\r\nthe result of all the long series of observations, calculations, and\r\ndiscussions since the time of Werner and Hutton, and in which a vast\r\nnumber of able physicists and naturalists have borne a part, because\r\nthey may be considered as certain deductions from our actual knowledge,\r\nand because they lie at the foundation of a rational physical geology.\r\n\r\nWe may roughly popularise these deductions by comparing the earth to a\r\ndrupe or stone-fruit, such as a plum or peach somewhat dried up. It\r\nhas a large and intensely hard stone and kernel, a thin pulp made up\r\nof two layers, an inner, more dense and dark-coloured, and an outer,\r\nless dense and lighter-coloured. These constitute the under-crust. On\r\nthe outside it has a thin membrane or over-crust. In the process of\r\ndrying it has slightly shrunk, so as to produce ridges and hollows\r\nof the outer crust, and this outer crust has cracked in some places,\r\nallowing portions of the pulp to ooze out--in some of them its lower\r\ndark substance, in others, its upper and lighter material. The analogy\r\nextends no farther, for there is nothing in our withered fruit to\r\nrepresent the oceans occupying the lower parts of the surface, or the\r\ndeposits which they have laid down.\r\n\r\nHere a most important feature demands attention. The rain, the streams,\r\nand the sea are constantly cutting down the land and depositing it in\r\nthe bed of the waters. Thus weight is taken from the land, and added\r\nto the sea bed. Geological facts, such as the great thickness of the\r\ncoal measures, in which we find thousands of feet of sediment, all of\r\nwhich must have been deposited in shallow water, and the accumulation\r\nof hundreds of feet of superficial material in deltas at the mouth\r\nof great rivers, show that the crust of the earth is so mobile as to\r\nyield downward to every pressure, however slight.[29] It may do this\r\nslowly and gradually, or by jumps from time to time; and this yielding\r\nnecessarily tends to squeeze up the edges of the depressed portions\r\ninto ridges, and to cause lateral movement and ejection of volcanic\r\nmatter at intervals.\r\n\r\n[29] Starkie Gardiner, _Nature_, December, 1889.\r\n\r\nKeeping in view these general conclusions, let us now turn to their\r\nbearing on the origin and history of the North Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThough the Atlantic is a deep ocean, its basin does not constitute so\r\nmuch a depression of the crust of the earth as a flattening of it, and\r\nthis, as recent soundings have shown, with a slight ridge or elevation\r\nalong its middle, and banks or terraces fringing the edges, so that its\r\nform is not so much that of a basin as that of a shallow elongated\r\nplate with its middle a little raised. Its true margins are composed\r\nof portions of the over-crust folded, overlapped and crushed, as if by\r\nlateral pressure emanating from the sea itself. We cannot, for example,\r\nlook at a geological map of America without perceiving that the\r\nAppalachian ridges, which intervene between the Atlantic and the St.\r\nLawrence valley, have been driven bodily back by a force acting from\r\nthe east, and that they have resisted this pressure only where, as in\r\nthe Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Catskill region of New York, they have\r\nbeen protected by outlying masses of very old rocks, as, for example,\r\nby that of the island of Newfoundland and that of the Adirondack\r\nMountains. The admirable work begun by my friend and fellow-student,\r\nProfessor James Nicol, followed up by Professor Lapworth, and now,\r\nafter long controversy, fully confirmed by the recent observations\r\nof the Geological Survey of Scotland, has shown the most intense\r\naction of the same kind on the east side of the ocean in the Scottish\r\nhighlands; and the more widely distributed Eozoic and other old rocks\r\nof Scandinavia may be appealed to in further evidence of this.[30]\r\n\r\n[30] Address to Geological Section, Brit. Assoc., by Prof. Judd,\r\nAberdeen Meeting, 1885. According to Rogers, the crumpling of the\r\nAppalachians has reduced a breadth of 158 miles to about 60. Geikie,\r\nAddress, Geological Society, 1891-2.\r\n\r\nIf we now inquire as to the cause of the Atlantic depression, we must\r\ngo back to the time when the areas occupied by the Atlantic and its\r\nbounding coasts were parts of the shoreless sea in which the earliest\r\ngneisses or stratified granites of the Laurentian age were being laid\r\ndown in vastly extended beds. These ancient crystalline rocks have been\r\nthe subject of much discussion and controversy, to which reference has\r\nbeen made in a previous chapter.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed, in regard to these theories, that they do not\r\nsuppose that the old gneiss is an ordinary sediment, but that all\r\nregard it as formed in exceptional circumstances, these circumstances\r\nbeing the absence of land and of subaërial decay of rock, and the\r\npresence wholly or principally of the material of the upper surface\r\nof the recently hardened crust. This being granted, the question\r\narises, Ought we not to combine the several theories as to the origin\r\nof gneiss, and to believe that the cooling crust has hardened in\r\nsuccessive layers from without inward; that at the same time fissures\r\nwere locally discharging igneous matter to the surface; that matter\r\nheld in suspension in the ocean and matter held in solution by heated\r\nwaters rising from beneath the outer crust were mingling their\r\nmaterials in the deposits of the primitive ocean?[31] It would seem\r\nthat the combination of all these agencies may safely be evoked as\r\ncauses of the pre-Atlantic deposits. This is the eclectic position I\r\nhave maintained in a previous chapter, and which I hold to be in every\r\nway the most probable.\r\n\r\n[31] Hunt, _Transactions Royal Society of Canada_, 1885.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose, then, the floor of old ocean covered with a flat\r\npavement of gneiss, or of that material which is now gneiss, the next\r\nquestion is, How and when did this original bed become converted into\r\nsea and land? Here we have some things certain, others most debatable.\r\nThat the cooling mass, especially if it was sending out volumes of\r\nsoftened rocky material, either in the form of volcanic ejections or\r\nin that of matter dissolved in heated water, and piling this on the\r\nsurface, must soon become too small for its shell, is apparent; but\r\nwhen and where would the collapse, crushing and wrinkling inevitable\r\nfrom this cause begin? The date is indicated by the lines of old\r\nmountain chains which traverse the Laurentian districts; but the reason\r\nwhy is less apparent. The more or less unequal cooling, hardening\r\nand conductive power of the outer crust we may readily assume. The\r\ndriftage unequally of water-borne detritus to the south-west by the\r\nbottom currents of the sea is another cause, and, as we shall soon see,\r\nmost effective. Still another is the greater cooling and hardening of\r\nthe crust in the polar regions, and the tendency to collapse of the\r\nequatorial protuberance from the slackening of the earth's rotation.\r\nBesides these, the internal tides of the earth's substance at the\r\ntimes of solstice would exert an oblique pulling force on the crust,\r\nwhich might tend to crack it along diagonal lines. From whichever of\r\nthese causes, or the combination of the whole, we know that, within\r\nthe Laurentian time, folded portions of the earth's crust began to\r\nrise above the general surface, in broad belts running from north-east\r\nto south-west, and from north-west to south-east, where the older\r\nmountains of Eastern America and Western Europe now stand, and that\r\nthe subsidence of the oceanic areas, allowed by this crumpling of\r\nthe crust, permitted other areas on both sides of the Atlantic to\r\nform limited table-lands. This was the commencement of a process\r\nrepeated again and again in subsequent times, and which began in the\r\nmiddle Laurentian, when for the first time we find beds of quartzite,\r\nlimestone, and iron ore, and graphite beds, indicating that there was\r\nalready land and water, and that the sea, and perhaps the land, swarmed\r\nwith forms of animal and plant life, unknown, for the most part, now.\r\nIndependently of the questions as to the animal nature of Eozoon, I\r\nhold that we know, as certainly as we can know anything inferentially,\r\nthe existence of these primitive forms of life. If I were to conjecture\r\nwhat were these early forms of plant and animal life, still unknown to\r\nus by actual specimens, I would suppose that, just as in the Palæozoic,\r\nthe acrogens culminated in gigantic and complex forest trees, so in the\r\nLaurentian, the algæ, the lichens, and the mosses grew to dimensions\r\nand assumed complexity of structure unexampled in later times, and\r\nthat, in the sea, the humbler forms of Protozoa and Sea Mosses were the\r\ndominant types, but in gigantic and complex forms. The land of this\r\nperiod was probably limited, for the most part, to high latitudes, and\r\nits aspect, though more rugged and abrupt, and of greater elevation,\r\nmust have been of that character which we still see in the Laurentian\r\nhills. The distribution of this ancient land is indicated by the long\r\nlines of old Laurentian rock extending from the Labrador coast and\r\nthe north shore of the St. Lawrence, and along the eastern slopes\r\nof the Appalachians in America, and the like rocks of the Hebrides,\r\nthe Western Highlands, and the Scandinavian mountains. A small but\r\ninteresting remnant is that in the Malvern Hills, so well described by\r\nHoll. It will be well to note here, and to fix on our minds, that these\r\nancient ridges of Eastern America and Western Europe have been greatly\r\ndenuded and wasted since Laurentian times, and that it is along their\r\neastern sides that the greatest sedimentary accumulations have been\r\ndeposited.\r\n\r\nFrom this time dates the introduction of that dominance of existing\r\ncauses which forms the basis of uniformitarianism in geology, and which\r\nhad to go on with various and great modifications of detail, through\r\nthe successive stages of the geological history, till the land and\r\nwater of the northern hemisphere attained to their present complex\r\nstructure.\r\n\r\nSo soon as we have a circumpolar belt or patches of Eozoic[32] land and\r\nridges running southward from it, we enter on new and more complicated\r\nmethods of growth of the continents and seas. Portions of the oldest\r\ncrystalline rocks, raised out of the protecting water, were now eroded\r\nby atmospheric agents, and especially by the carbonic acid, then\r\nexisting in the atmosphere perhaps more abundantly than at present,\r\nunder whose influence the hardest of the gneissic rocks gradually\r\ndecay. The arctic lands were subjected, in addition, to the powerful\r\nmechanical force of frost and thaw. Thus every shower of rain and\r\nevery swollen stream would carry into the sea the products of the\r\nwaste of land, sorting them into fine clays and coarser sands; and the\r\ncold currents which cling to the ocean bottom, now determined in their\r\ncourses, not merely by the earth's rotation, but also by the lines of\r\nfolding on both sides of the Atlantic, would carry south-westward, and\r\npile up in marginal banks of great thickness the _débris_ produced\r\nfrom the rapid waste of the land already existing in the Arctic\r\nregions. The Atlantic, opening widely to the north, and having large\r\nrivers pouring into it, was, especially, the ocean characterised, as\r\ntime advanced, by the prevalence of these phenomena. Thus, throughout\r\nthe geological history it has happened that, while the middle of the\r\nAtlantic has received merely organic deposits of shells of foraminifera\r\nand similar organisms, and this probably only to a small amount, its\r\nmargins have had piled upon them beds of detritus of immense thickness.\r\nProfessor Hall, of Albany, was the first geologist who pointed out\r\nthe vast cosmic importance of these deposits, and that the mountains\r\nof both sides of the Atlantic owe their origin to these great lines\r\nof deposition, along with the fact, afterwards more fully insisted on\r\nby Rogers, that the portions of the crust which received these masses\r\nof _débris_ became thereby weighted down and softened, and were more\r\nliable than other parts to lateral crushing.\r\n\r\n[32] Or Archæan, or pre-Cambrian, if these terms are preferred.\r\n\r\nThus, in the later Eozoic and early Palæozoic times, which succeeded\r\nthe first foldings of the oldest Laurentian, great ridges were thrown\r\nup, along the edges of which were beds of limestone, and on their\r\nsummits and sides, thick masses of ejected igneous rocks. In the bed\r\nof the central Atlantic there are no such accumulations. It must have\r\nbeen a flat, or slightly ridged, plate of the ancient gneiss, hard and\r\nresisting, though perhaps with a few cracks, through which igneous\r\nmatter welled up, as in Iceland and the Azores in more modern times.\r\nIn this condition of things we have causes tending to perpetuate and\r\nextend the distinctions of ocean and continent, mountain and plain,\r\nalready begun; and of these we may more especially note the continued\r\nsubsidence of the areas of greatest marine deposition. This has long\r\nattracted attention, and affords very convincing evidence of the\r\nconnection of sedimentary deposit as a cause with the subsidence of the\r\ncrust.[33]\r\n\r\n[33] Dutton in _Report of U.S. Geological Survey_, 1891. From facts\r\nstated in this report and in my \"Acadian Geology,\" it is apparent\r\nthat in the Western States and in the coal fields of Nova Scotia,\r\nshallow-water deposits have been laid down, up to thicknesses of 10,000\r\nto 20,000 feet in connection with continuous subsidence. See also a\r\npaper by Ricketts in the _Geol. Mag._, 1883.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to a French physicist, M. Faye, for an important\r\nsuggestion on this subject. It is that the sediment accumulated\r\nalong the shores of the ocean presented an obstacle to radiation,\r\nand consequently to cooling of the crust, while the ocean floor,\r\nunprotected and unweighted, and constantly bathed with currents of cold\r\nwater having great power of convection of heat, would be more rapidly\r\ncooled, and so would become thicker and stronger. This suggestion\r\nis complementary to the theory of Professor Hall, that the areas of\r\ngreatest deposit on the margins of the ocean are necessarily those of\r\ngreatest folding and consequent elevation. We have thus a hard, thick,\r\nresisting ocean bottom, which, as it settles down toward the interior,\r\nunder the influence of gravity, squeezes upwards and folds and plicates\r\nall the soft sediments deposited on its edges. The Atlantic area is\r\nalmost an unbroken cake of this kind. The Pacific area has cracked in\r\nmany places, allowing the interior fluid matter to exude in volcanic\r\nejections.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that all this supposes a permanent continuance of\r\nthe ocean basins, whereas many geologists postulate a mid-Atlantic\r\ncontinent to give the thick masses of detritus found in the older\r\nformations both in Eastern America and Western Europe, and which thin\r\noff in proceeding into the interior of both continents. I prefer, as\r\nalready stated, to consider these belts of sediment as the deposits\r\nof northern currents, and derived from arctic land, and that, like\r\nthe great banks off the American coast at the present day, which are\r\nbeing built up by the present arctic current, they had little to do\r\nwith any direct drainage from the adjacent shore. We need not deny,\r\nhowever, that such ridges of land as existed along the Atlantic margins\r\nwere contributing their quota of river-borne material, just as on a\r\nstill greater scale the Amazon and Mississippi are doing now, and\r\nthis especially on the sides toward the present continental plateaus,\r\nthough the greater part must have been derived from the wide tracts\r\nof Laurentian land within the Arctic Circle, or near to it. It is\r\nfurther obvious that the ordinary reasoning respecting the necessity\r\nof continental areas in the present ocean basins would actually\r\noblige us to suppose that the whole of the oceans and continents\r\nhad repeatedly changed places. This consideration opposes enormous\r\nphysical difficulties to any theory of alternations of the oceanic and\r\ncontinental areas, except locally at their margins.\r\n\r\nBut the permanence of the Atlantic depression does not exclude the idea\r\nof successive submergences of the continental plateaus and marginal\r\nslopes, alternating with periods of elevation, when the ocean retreated\r\nfrom the continents and contracted its limits. In this respect the\r\nAtlantic of to-day is much smaller than it was in those times when it\r\nspread widely over the continental plains and slopes, and much larger\r\nthan it has been in times of continental elevation. This leads us to\r\nthe further consideration that, while the ocean beds have been sinking,\r\nother areas have been better supported, and constitute the continental\r\nplateaus; and that it has been at or near the junctions of these\r\nsinking and rising areas that the thickest deposits of detritus, the\r\nmost extensive foldings, and the greatest ejections of volcanic matter\r\nhave occurred. There has thus been a permanence of the position of\r\nthe continents and oceans throughout geological time, but with many\r\noscillations of these areas, producing submergences and emergences of\r\nthe land. In this way we can reconcile the vast vicissitudes of the\r\ncontinental areas in different geological periods with that continuity\r\nof development from north to south, and from the interiors to the\r\nmargins, which is so marked a feature. We have, for this reason, to\r\nformulate another apparent geological paradox, namely, that while, in\r\none sense, the continental and oceanic areas are permanent, in another,\r\nthey have been in continual movement. Nor does this view exclude\r\nextension of the continental borders or of chains of islands beyond\r\ntheir present limits, at certain periods; and indeed, the general\r\nprinciple already stated, that subsidence of the ocean bed has produced\r\nelevation of the land, implies in earlier periods a shallower ocean and\r\nmany possibilities as to volcanic islands, and low continental margins\r\ncreeping out into the sea; while it is also to be noted that there are,\r\nas already stated, bordering shelves, constituting shallows in the\r\nocean, which at certain periods have emerged as land.\r\n\r\nWe are thus compelled, as already stated, to believe in the\r\ncontemporaneous existence in all geological periods, except perhaps\r\nthe earliest of them, of the three distinct conditions of areas on the\r\nsurface of the earth, defined in chapter second oceanic areas of deep\r\nsea, continental plateaus and marginal shelves, and lines of plication\r\nand folding.\r\n\r\nIn the successive geological periods the continental plateaus, when\r\nsubmerged, owing to their vast extent of warm and shallow sea, have\r\nbeen the great theatres of the development of marine life and of\r\nthe deposition of organic limestones, and when elevated, they have\r\nfurnished the abodes of the noblest land faunas and floras. The\r\nmountain belts, especially in the north, have been the refuge and\r\nstronghold of land life in periods of submergence; and the deep\r\nocean basins have been the perennial abodes of pelagic and abyssal\r\ncreatures and the refuge of multitudes of other marine animals and\r\nplants in times of continental elevation. These general facts are full\r\nof importance with reference to the question of the succession of\r\nformations and of life in the geological history of the earth.\r\n\r\nSo much space has been occupied with these general views, that it would\r\nbe impossible to trace the history of the Atlantic in detail through\r\nthe ages of the Palæozoic, Mesozoic, and Tertiary. We may, however,\r\nshortly glance at the changes of the three kinds of surface already\r\nreferred to. The bed of the ocean seems to have remained, on the whole,\r\nabyssal; but there were probably periods when those shallow reaches of\r\nthe Atlantic which stretch across its most northern portion, and partly\r\nseparate it from the Arctic basin, presented connecting coasts or\r\ncontinuous chains of islands sufficient to permit animals and plants to\r\npass over.[34] At certain periods also there were, not unlikely, groups\r\nof volcanic islands, like the Azores, in the temperate or tropical\r\nAtlantic. More especially might this be the case in that early time\r\nwhen it was more like the present Pacific; and the line of the great\r\nvolcanic belt of the Mediterranean, the mid-Atlantic banks, the Azores\r\nand the West India Islands point to the possibility of such partial\r\nconnections. These were stepping stones, so to speak, over which land\r\norganisms might cross, and some of these may be connected with the\r\nfabulous or pre-historic Atlantis.\r\n\r\n[34] It would seem, from Geikie's description of the Faroe Islands,\r\nthat they may be a remnant of such connecting land, dating from the\r\nCretaceous or Eocene period.\r\n\r\nIn the Palæozoic period, the distinctions already referred to, into\r\ncontinental plateaus, mountain ridges, and ocean depths, were first\r\ndeveloped, and we find, already, great masses of sediment accumulating\r\non the seaward sides of the old Laurentian ridges, and internal\r\ndeposits thinning away from these ridges over the submerged continental\r\nareas, and presenting dissimilar conditions of sedimentation. It would\r\nseem also that, as Hicks has argued for Europe, and Logan and Hall\r\nfor America, this Cambrian age was one of slow subsidence of the land\r\npreviously elevated, accompanied with or caused by thick deposits of\r\ndetritus along the borders of the subsiding shore, which was probably\r\ncovered with the decomposing rock arising from long ages of subaërial\r\nwaste.\r\n\r\nIn the coal formation age its characteristic swampy flats stretched\r\nin some places far into the shallower parts of the ocean.[35] In the\r\nPermian, the great plicated mountain margins were fully developed on\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic. In the Jurassic, the American continent\r\nprobably extended farther to the sea than at present. In the Wealden\r\nage there was much land to the west and north of Great Britain,\r\nand Professor Bonney has directed attention to the evidence of the\r\nexistence of this land as far back as the Trias, while Mr. Starkie\r\nGardiner has insisted on connecting links to the southward, as\r\nevidenced by fossil plants. So late as the Post-glacial, or early human\r\nperiod, large tracts, now submerged, formed portions of the continents.\r\nOn the other hand, the interior plains of America and Europe were often\r\nsubmerged. Such submergences are indicated by the great limestones\r\nof the Palæozoic, by the chalk and its representative beds in the\r\nCretaceous, by the Nummulitic formation in the Eocene, and lastly,\r\nby the great Pleistocene submergence, one of the most remarkable of\r\nall, one in which nearly the whole northern hemisphere participated,\r\nand which was probably separated from the present time by only a few\r\nthousands of years.[36] These submergences and elevations were not\r\nalways alike on the two sides of the Atlantic. The Salina period of the\r\nSilurian, for example, and the Jurassic, show continental elevation in\r\nAmerica not shared by Europe. The great subsidences of the Cretaceous\r\nand the Eocene were proportionally deeper and wider on the eastern\r\ncontinent, and this and the direction of the land being from north to\r\nsouth, cause more ancient forms of life to survive in America. These\r\nelevations and submergences of the plateaus alternated with the periods\r\nof mountain-making plication, which was going on at intervals, at the\r\nclose of the Eozoic, at the beginning of the Cambrian, at the close of\r\nthe Siluro-Cambrian, in the Permian, and in Europe and Western America\r\nin the Tertiary. The series of changes, however, affecting all these\r\nareas was of a highly complex character in detail.[37]\r\n\r\n[35] I have shown the evidence of this in the remnants of Carboniferous\r\ndistricts once more extensive on the Atlantic coast of Nova Scotia and\r\nCape Breton (\"Acadian Geology\").\r\n\r\n[36] The recent surveys of the Falls of Niagara coincide with a great\r\nmany evidences to which I have elsewhere referred in proving that the\r\nPleistocene submergence of America and Europe came to an end not more\r\nthan ten thousand years ago, and was itself not of very great duration.\r\nThus in Pleistocene times the land must have been submerged and\r\nre-elevated in a very rapid manner.\r\n\r\n[37] \"Acadian Geology.\"\r\n\r\nWe may also note a fact which I have long ago insisted on,[38] the\r\nregular pulsation of the continental areas, giving us alternations\r\nin each great system of deep-sea and shallow-water beds, so that\r\nthe successive groups of formations may be divided into triplets of\r\nshallow-water, deep-water, and shallow-water strata, alternating in\r\neach period. This law of succession applies more particularly to\r\nthe formations of the continental plateaus, rather than to those of\r\nthe ocean margins, and it shows that, intervening between the great\r\nmovements of plication there were subsidences of those plateaus, or\r\nelevations of the sea bottom, which allowed the waters to spread\r\nthemselves over all the inland spaces between the great folded mountain\r\nranges of the Atlantic borders.\r\n\r\n[38] \"Acadian Geology.\"\r\n\r\nIn referring to the ocean basins we should bear in mind that there are\r\nthree of these in the northern hemisphere the Arctic, the Pacific, and\r\nthe Atlantic. De Ranee has ably summed up the known facts as to Arctic\r\ngeology in a series of articles in _Nature_, from which it appears\r\nthat this area presents from without inwards a succession of older and\r\nnewer formations from the Eozoic to the Tertiary, and that its extent\r\nmust have been greater in former periods than at present, while it\r\nmust have enjoyed a comparatively warm climate from the Cambrian to\r\nthe Pleistocene period. The relations of its deposits and fossils are\r\ncloser with those of the Atlantic than with those of the Pacific, as\r\nmight be anticipated from its wider opening into the former. Blandford\r\nhas recently remarked on the correspondence of the marginal deposits\r\naround the Pacific and Indian oceans,[39] and Dr. Dawson informs me\r\nthat this is equally marked in comparison with the west coast of\r\nAmerica, but these marginal areas have not yet gained much on the\r\nocean. In the North Atlantic, on the other hand, there is a wide belt\r\nof comparatively modern rocks on both sides, more especially toward the\r\nsouth and on the American side; but while there appears to be a perfect\r\ncorrespondence on both sides of the Atlantic, and around the Pacific\r\nrespectively, there seems to be less parallelism between the deposits\r\nand forms of life of the two oceans, as compared with each other, and\r\nless correspondence in forms of life, especially in modern times.\r\nStill, in the earlier geological ages, as might have been anticipated\r\nfrom the imperfect development of the continents, the same forms of\r\nlife characterise the whole ocean from Australia to Arctic America, and\r\nindicate a grand unity of Pacific and Atlantic life not equalled in\r\nlater times,[40] and which speaks of true contemporaneity rather than\r\nof what has been termed homotaxis or mere likeness of orders.\r\n\r\n[39] _Journal of Geological Society_, May, 1886. Blandford's statements\r\nrespecting the mechanical deposits of the close of the Palæozoic in\r\nthe Indian Ocean, whether these are glacial or not, would seem to show\r\na correspondence with the Permian conglomerates and earth-movements\r\nof the Atlantic area; but since that time the Atlantic has enjoyed\r\ncomparative repose. The Pacific seems to have reproduced the conditions\r\nof the Carboniferous in the Cretaceous age, and seems to have been less\r\naffected by the great changes of the Pleistocene.\r\n\r\n[40] Daintree and Etheridge, \"Queensland Geology,\" _Journal Geological\r\nSociety_, August, 1872; R. Etheridge, Junior, \"Australian Fossils,\"\r\n_Trans. Phys. Soc. Edin._, 1880.\r\n\r\nWe may pause here for a moment to notice some of the effects of\r\nAtlantic growth on modern geography. It has given us rugged and broken\r\nshores, composed of old rocks in the north, and newer formations and\r\nsofter features toward the south. It has given us marginal mountain\r\nridges and internal plateaus on both sides of the sea. It has produced\r\ncertain curious and by no means accidental correspondences of the\r\neastern and western sides. Thus the solid basis on which the British\r\nIslands stand may be compared with Newfoundland and Labrador, the\r\nEnglish Channel with the Gulf of St. Lawrence, the Bay of Biscay with\r\nthe Bay of Maine, Spain with the projection of the American land at\r\nCape Hatteras, the Mediterranean with the Gulf of Mexico. The special\r\nconditions of deposition and plication necessary to these results, and\r\ntheir bearing on the character and productions of the Atlantic basin,\r\nwould require a volume for their detailed elucidation.\r\n\r\nThus far our discussion has been limited almost entirely to physical\r\ncauses and effects. If we now turn to the life history of the Atlantic,\r\nwe are met at the threshold with the question of climate, not as a\r\nthing fixed and immutable, but as changing from age to age in harmony\r\nwith geographical mutations, and producing long cosmic summers and\r\nwinters of alternate warmth and refrigeration.\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely doubt that the close connection of the Atlantic and\r\nArctic oceans is one factor in those remarkable vicissitudes of climate\r\nexperienced by the former, and in which the Pacific area has also\r\nshared in connection with the Antarctic Sea. No geological facts are\r\nindeed at first sight more strange and inexplicable than the changes\r\nof climate in the Atlantic area, even in comparatively modern periods.\r\nWe know that in the early Tertiary temperate conditions reigned as\r\nfar north as the middle of Greenland, and that in the Pleistocene the\r\nArctic cold advanced until an almost perennial winter prevailed half\r\nway to the equator. It is no wonder that nearly every cause available\r\nin the heavens and the earth has been invoked to account for these\r\nastounding facts. I shall, I trust, be excused if, neglecting most of\r\nthese theoretical views, I venture to invite attention, in connection\r\nwith this question, chiefly to the old Lyellian doctrine of the\r\nmodification of climate by geographical changes. Let us, at least,\r\nconsider how much these are able to account for.\r\n\r\nThe ocean is a great equalizer of extremes of temperature. It does this\r\nby its great capacity for heat, and by its cooling and heating power\r\nwhen passing from the solid into the liquid and gaseous states, and the\r\nreverse. It also acts by its mobility, its currents serving to convey\r\nheat to great distances, or to cool the air by the movement of cold\r\nicy waters. The land, on the other hand, cools or warms rapidly, and\r\ncan transmit its influence to a distance only by the winds, and the\r\ninfluence so transmitted is rather in the nature of a disturbing than\r\nof an equalizing cause. It follows that any change in the distribution\r\nof land and water must affect climate, more especially if it changes\r\nthe character or course of the ocean currents.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Atlantic, in this connection we perceive that its\r\npresent condition is peculiar and exceptional. On the one hand it is\r\nwidely open to the Arctic Sea and the influence of its cold currents,\r\nand on the other it is supplied with a heating apparatus of enormous\r\npower to give a special elevation of temperature, more particularly to\r\nits eastern coasts. The great equatorial current running across from\r\nAfrica is on its northern side embayed in the Gulf of Mexico, as in a\r\ngreat cauldron, and pouring through the mouth of this in the Bahama\r\nchannel, forms the gulf stream, which, widening out like a fan, forms\r\na vast expanse of warm water, from which the prevailing westerly winds\r\nof the North Atlantic waft a constant supply of heated moist air to\r\nthe western coasts of Europe, giving them a much more warm and uniform\r\nclimate than that which prevails in similar latitudes in Eastern\r\nAmerica, where the cold Arctic currents hug the shore, and bring down\r\nice from Baffin's Bay. Now all this might be differently arranged. We\r\nshall find that there were times, when the Isthmus of Panama being\r\nbroken through, there was no Gulf Stream, and Norway and England\r\nwere reduced to the conditions of Greenland and Labrador, and when\r\nrefrigeration was still further increased by subsidence of northern\r\nlands affording freer sweep to the Arctic currents. On the other hand,\r\nthere were times when the Gulf of Mexico extended much farther north\r\nthan at present, and formed an additional surface of warm water to heat\r\nall the interior of America, as well as the Atlantic. Geographical\r\nchanges of these kinds, have probably given us the glacial period in\r\nvery recent times, and at an earlier era those warm climates which\r\npermitted temperate vegetation to flourish as far north as Greenland.\r\nThese are, however, great topics, which must form the subject of other\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nI am old enough to remember the sensation caused by the delightful\r\nrevelations of Edward Forbes respecting the zones of animal life in\r\nthe sea, and the vast insight which they gave into the significance of\r\nthe work on minute organisms previously done by Ehrenberg, Lonsdale\r\nand Williamson, and into the meaning of fossil remains. A little later\r\nthe soundings for the Atlantic cable revealed the chalky foraminiferal\r\nooze of the abyssal ocean. Still more recently, the wealth of facts\r\ndisclosed by the _Challenger_ voyage, which naturalists have scarcely\r\nyet had time to digest, have opened up to us new worlds of deep-sea\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThe bed of the deep Atlantic is covered, for the most part, by a mud\r\nor ooze, largely made up of the _débris_ of foraminifera and other\r\nminute organisms mixed with fine clay. In the North Atlantic the\r\nNorwegian naturalists call this the Biloculina mud. Farther south, the\r\n_Challenger_ naturalists speak of it as Globigerina ooze. In point of\r\nfact it contains different species of foraminiferal shells, Globigerina\r\nand Orbulina being in some localities dominant, and in others, other\r\nspecies; and these changes are more apparent in the shallower portions\r\nof the ocean.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are means for disseminating coarse material\r\nover parts of the ocean beds. There are, in the line of the Arctic\r\ncurrent, on the American coast, great sand banks, and off the coast of\r\nNorway, sand constitutes a considerable part of the bottom material.\r\nSoundings and dredgings off Great Britain, and also off the American\r\ncoast, have shown that fragments of stone referable to Arctic lands\r\nare abundantly strewn over the bottom, along certain lines, and the\r\nAntarctic continent, otherwise almost unknown, makes its presence\r\nfelt to the dredge by the abundant masses of crystalline rock drifted\r\nfar from it to the north. These are not altogether new discoveries.\r\nI had inferred, many years ago, from stones taken up by the hooks of\r\nfishermen on the banks of Newfoundland, that rocky material from the\r\nnorth is dropped on these banks by the heavy ice which drifts over them\r\nevery spring, that these are glaciated, and that after they fall to the\r\nbottom sand is drifted over them with sufficient velocity to polish the\r\nstones, and to erode the shelly coverings of Arctic animals attached\r\nto them.[41] If, then, the Atlantic basin were upheaved into land, we\r\nshould see beds of sand, gravel and boulders with clay flats and layers\r\nof marl and limestone. According to the _Challenger_ reports, in the\r\nAntarctic seas S. of 64 there is blue mud, with fragments of rock, in\r\ndepths of 1,200 to 2,000 fathoms. The stones, some of them glaciated,\r\nwere granite, diorite, amphibolite, mica schist, gneiss and quartzite.\r\nThis deposit ceases and gives place to Globigerina ooze and red clay\r\nat 46° to 47° S., but even farther north there is sometimes as much as\r\n49 per cent, of crystalline sand. In the Labrador current a block of\r\nsyenite, weighing 400 lbs., was taken up from 1,340 fathoms, and in the\r\nArctic current, 100 miles from land, was a stony deposit, some stones\r\nbeing glaciated. Among these were smoky quartz, quartzite, limestone,\r\ndolomite, mica schist, and serpentine; also particles of monoclinic and\r\ntriclinic felspar, hornblende, augite, magnetite, mica and glauconite,\r\nthe latter, no doubt, formed in the sea bottom, the others drifted from\r\nEozoic and Palæozoic formations to the north.[42]\r\n\r\n[41] \"Notes on Post-Pliocene of Canada,\" 1872.\r\n\r\n[42] _General Report, \"Challenger\" Expedition_.\r\n\r\nA remarkable fact in this connection is that the great depths of\r\nthe sea are as impassable to the majority of marine animals as the\r\nland itself. According to Murray, while twelve of the _Challenger's_\r\ndredgings, taken in depths greater than 2,000 fathoms, gave 92 species,\r\nmostly new to science, a similar number of dredgings in shallower water\r\nnear the land, give no less than 1,000 species. Hence arises another\r\napparent paradox relating to the distribution of organic beings. While\r\nat first sight it might seem that the chances of wide distribution\r\nare exceptionally great for marine species, this is not so. Except in\r\nthe case of those which enjoy a period of free locomotion when young,\r\nor are floating and pelagic, the deep ocean sets bounds to their\r\nmigrations. On the other hand, the spores of cryptogamic plants may\r\nbe carried for vast distances by the wind, and the growth of volcanic\r\nislands may effect connections which, though only temporary, may afford\r\nopportunity for land animals and plants to pass over.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the transmission of living beings across the\r\nAtlantic, we have before us the remarkable fact that from the Cambrian\r\nage onwards there were, on the two sides of the ocean, many species\r\nof invertebrate animals which were either identical or so closely\r\nallied as to be possibly varietal forms, indicating probably the\r\nshallowness of the ocean in these periods. In like manner, the early\r\nplants of the Upper Silurian, Devonian, and Carboniferous present many\r\nidentical species; but this identity is less marked in more modern\r\ntimes. Even in the latter, however, there are remarkable connections\r\nbetween the floras of oceanic islands and the continents. Thus the\r\nBermudas, altogether recent islands, have been stocked by the agency\r\nchiefly of the ocean currents and of birds, with nearly 150 species\r\nof continental plants; and the facts collected by Helmsley as to\r\nthe present facilities of transmission, along with the evidence\r\nafforded by older oceanic islands which have been receiving animal and\r\nvegetable colonists for longer periods, go far to show that, time being\r\ngiven, the sea actually affords facilities for the migration of the\r\ninhabitants of the land, comparable with those of continuous continents.\r\n\r\nIn so far as plants are concerned, it is to be observed that the early\r\nforests were largely composed of cryptogamous plants, and the spores of\r\nthese in modern times have proved capable of transmission from great\r\ndistances. In considering this, we cannot fail to conclude, that the\r\nunion of simple cryptogamous fructification with arboreal stems of\r\nhigh complexity, so well illustrated by Dr. Williamson, had a direct\r\nrelation to the necessity for a rapid and wide distribution of these\r\nancient trees. It seems also certain that some spores, as, for example,\r\nthose of the Rhizocarps,[43] a type of vegetation abundant in the\r\nPalæozoic, and certain kinds of seeds, as those named _Æthoetesta_\r\nand _Pachytheca_, were fitted for flotation. Further, the periods of\r\nArctic warmth permitted the passage around the northern belt of many\r\ntemperate species of plants, just as now happens with the Arctic flora;\r\nand when these were displaced by colder periods, they marched southward\r\nalong both sides of the sea on the mountain chains.\r\n\r\n[43] See paper by the author on Palæozoic Rhizocarps, _Chicago Trans._,\r\n1886.\r\n\r\nThe same remark applies to northern forms of marine invertebrates,\r\nwhich are much more widely distributed in longitude than those farther\r\nsouth. The late Mr. Gywn Jeffreys, in one of his latest communications\r\non this subject, stated that 54 per cent, of the shallow-water mollusks\r\nof New England and Canada are also European, and of the deep-sea forms,\r\n30 out of 35; these last, of course, enjoying greater facilities for\r\nmigration than those which have to travel slowly along the shallows of\r\nthe coast in order to cross the ocean and settle themselves on both\r\nsides. Many of these animals, like the common mussel and sand clam,\r\nare old settlers which came over in the Pleistocene period, or even\r\nearlier. Others, like the common periwinkle, seem to have been slowly\r\nextending themselves in modern times, perhaps even by the agency of\r\nman. The older immigrants may possibly have taken advantage of lines of\r\ncoast now submerged, or of warm periods, when they could creep round\r\nthe Arctic shores. Mr. Herbert Carpenter and other naturalists employed\r\non the _Challenger_ collections have made similar statements respecting\r\nother marine invertebrates, as, for instance, the Echinoderms, of\r\nwhich the deep-sea crinoids present many common species, and my own\r\ncollections prove that many of the shallow-water forms are common.\r\nDall and Whiteaves[44] have shown that some mollusks and Echinoderms\r\nare common even to the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America;\r\na remarkable fact, testifying at once to the fixity of these species\r\nand to the manner in which they have been able to take advantage of\r\ngeographical changes. Some of the species of whelks common to the Gulf\r\nof St. Lawrence and the Pacific are animals which have no special\r\nlocomotive powers, even when young, but they are northern forms not\r\nproceeding far south, so that they may have passed through the Arctic\r\nseas. In this connection it is well to remark that many species of\r\nanimals have powers of locomotion in youth which they lose when adult,\r\nand that others may have special means of transit. I once found at\r\nGaspé a specimen of the Pacific species of Coronula, or whale-barnacle,\r\nthe _C. reginæ_ of Darwin, attached to a whale taken in the Gulf of\r\nSt. Lawrence, and which had possibly succeeded in making that passage\r\naround the north of America which so many navigators have essayed in\r\nvain.[45]\r\n\r\n[44] Dall, _Report on Alaska_; Whiteaves, _Trans. R. S. C._\r\n\r\n[45] I am informed, however, that the Coronula is found also in the\r\nBiscayan whales.\r\n\r\nBut it is to be remarked that while many plants and marine\r\ninvertebrates are common to the two sides of the Atlantic, it is\r\ndifferent with land animals, and especially vertebrates. I do not know\r\nthat any palæozoic insects or land snails or millipedes of Europe and\r\nAmerica are specifically identical, and of the numerous species of\r\nbatrachians of the Carboniferous and reptiles of the Mesozoic, all seem\r\nto be distinct on the two sides. The same appears to be the case with\r\nthe Tertiary mammals, until in the later stages of that great period we\r\nfind such genera as the horse, the camel, and the elephant appearing\r\non the two sides of the Atlantic; but even then the species seem\r\ndifferent, except in the case of a few northern forms.\r\n\r\nSome of the longer-lived mollusks of the Atlantic furnish suggestions\r\nwhich remarkably illustrate the biological aspect of these questions.\r\nOur familiar friend the oyster is one of these. The first-known oysters\r\nappear in the Carboniferous in Belgium and in the United States of\r\nAmerica. In the Carboniferous and Permian they are few and small, and\r\nthey do not culminate till the Cretaceous, in which there are no less\r\nthan ninety-one so-called species in America alone; but some of the\r\nlargest known species are found in the Eocene. The oyster, though an\r\ninhabitant of shallow water, and very limitedly locomotive when young,\r\nhas survived all the changes since the Carboniferous age, and has\r\nspread itself over the whole northern hemisphere,[46] though a warm\r\nwater rather than Arctic type.\r\n\r\n[46] White, _Report U.

Survey_, 1882-3.\r\n\r\nI have collected fossil oysters in the Cretaceous clays of the coulées\r\nof Western Canada, in the Lias shales of England, in the Eocene and\r\nthe Cretaceous beds of the Alps, of Egypt, of the Red Sea coast, of\r\nJudea, and the heights of Lebanon. Everywhere and in all formations\r\nthey present forms which are so variable and yet so similar that one\r\nmight suppose all the so-called species to be mere varieties. Did the\r\noyster originate separately on the two sides of the Atlantic, or did it\r\ncross over so promptly that its appearance seems to be identical on the\r\ntwo sides? Are all the oysters of a common ancestry, or did the causes,\r\nwhatever they were, which introduced the oyster in the Carboniferous\r\nact over again in later periods? Who can tell? This is one of the\r\ncases where causation and development--the two scientific factors\r\nwhich constitute the basis of what is called evolution--cannot easily\r\nbe isolated. I would recommend to those biologists who discuss these\r\nquestions to devote themselves to the oyster. This familiar mollusk has\r\nsuccessfully, pursued its course, and has overcome all its enemies,\r\nfrom the flat-toothed selachians of the Carboniferous to the oyster\r\ndredges of the present day, has varied almost indefinitely, and yet has\r\ncontinued to be an oyster, unless, indeed, it may at certain portions\r\nof its career have temporarily assumed the guise of a Gryphæa or an\r\nExogyra. The history of such an animal deserves to be traced with care,\r\nand much curious information respecting it will be found in the report\r\nwhich I have cited in the note.\r\n\r\nBut in these respects the oyster, is merely an example of many forms.\r\nSimilar considerations apply to all those Pliocene and Pleistocene\r\nmollusks which are found in the raised sea bottoms of Norway and\r\nScotland, on the top of Moel Tryfaen, in Wales, and at similar great\r\nheights on the hills of America, many of which can be traced back to\r\nearly Tertiary times, and can be found to have extended themselves\r\nover all the seas of the northern hemisphere. They apply in like\r\nmanner to the ferns, the conifers, and the broad-leaved trees, many\r\nof which we can now trace without specific change to the Eocene and\r\nCretaceous. They all show that the forms of living things are more\r\nstable than the lands and seas in which they live. If we were to adopt\r\nsome of the modern ideas of evolution, we might cut the Gordian knot\r\nby supposing that, as like causes produce like effects, these types\r\nof life have originated more than once in geological time, and need\r\nnot be genetically connected with each other. But while evolutionists\r\nrepudiate such an application of their doctrine, however natural and\r\nrational, it would seem that nature still more strongly repudiates it,\r\nand will not allow us to assume more than one origin for one species.\r\nThus the great question of geographical distribution remains in all its\r\nforce; and, by still another of our geological paradoxes, mountains\r\nbecome ephemeral things in comparison with the delicate herbage which\r\ncovers them, and seas are in their present extent but of yesterday,\r\nwhen compared with the minute and feeble organisms that creep on their\r\nsands or swim in their waters.\r\n\r\nThe question remains: Has the Atlantic achieved its destiny and\r\nfinished its course, or are there other changes in store for it in\r\nthe future? The earth's crust is now thicker and stronger than ever\r\nbefore, and its great ribs of crushed and folded rock are more firm and\r\nrigid than in any previous period. The stupendous volcanic phenomena\r\nmanifested in Mesozoic and early Tertiary times along the borders\r\nof the Atlantic have apparently died out. These facts are in so far\r\nguarantees of permanence. On the other hand, it is known that movements\r\nof elevation, along with local depression, are in progress in the\r\nArctic regions, and a great weight of new sediment is being deposited\r\nalong the borders of the Atlantic, especially on its western side;\r\nand this is not improbably connected with the earthquake shocks and\r\nslight movements of depression which have occurred in North America.\r\nIt is possible that these slight and secular movements may go on\r\nuninterruptedly, or with occasional paroxysmal disturbances, until\r\nconsiderable changes are produced.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, on the other hand, that after the long period of\r\nquiescence which has elapsed, there may be a new settlement of the\r\nocean bed, accompanied with foldings of the crust, especially on the\r\nwestern side of the Atlantic, and possibly with renewed volcanic\r\nactivity on its eastern margin. In either case, a long time relatively\r\nto our limited human chronology may intervene before the occurrence\r\nof any marked change. On the whole, the experience of the past would\r\nlead us to expect movements and eruptive discharges in the Pacific\r\nrather than in the Atlantic area. It is therefore not unlikely that the\r\nAtlantic may remain undisturbed, unless secondarily and indirectly,\r\nuntil after the Pacific area shall have attained to a greater degree of\r\nquiescence than at present. But this subject is one too much involved\r\nin uncertainty to warrant us in following it farther.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Atlantic is to us a practically permanent ocean,\r\nvarying only in its tides, its currents, and its winds, which science\r\nhas already reduced to definite laws, so that we can use if we cannot\r\nregulate them. It is ours to take advantage of this precious time of\r\nquietude, and to extend the blessings of science and of our Christian\r\ncivilisation from shore to shore, until there shall be no more sea,\r\nnot in the sense of that final drying-up of old ocean to which some\r\nphysicists look forward, but in the higher sense of its ceasing to be\r\nthe emblem of unrest and disturbance, and the cause of isolation.\r\n\r\nI must now close this chapter with a short statement of some general\r\ntruths which I have had in view in directing attention to the\r\ngeological development of the Atlantic. We cannot, I think, consider\r\nthe topics to which I have referred without perceiving that the history\r\nof ocean and continent is an example of progressive design, quite as\r\nmuch as that of living beings. Nor can we fail to see that, while\r\nin some important directions we have penetrated the great secret of\r\nnature, in reference to the general plan and structure of the earth\r\nand its waters, and the changes through which they have passed, we\r\nhave still very much to learn, and perhaps quite as much to unlearn,\r\nand that the future holds out to us and to our successors higher,\r\ngrander, and clearer conceptions than those to which we have yet\r\nattained. The vastness and the might of ocean and the manner in which\r\nit cherishes the feeblest and most fragile beings, alike speak to us of\r\nHim who holds it in the hollow of His hand, and gave to it of old its\r\nboundaries and its laws; but its teaching ascends to a higher tone when\r\nwe consider its origin and history, and the manner in which it has been\r\nmade to build up continents and mountain-chains, and, at the same time,\r\nto nourish and sustain the teeming life of sea and land.\r\n\r\n  References:--Presidential Address to the British Association for the\r\n    Advancement of Science, Birmingham, 1886. \"Geology of Nova Scotia,\r\n    New Brunswick, and Prince Edward Island.\" Fourth Edition, London,\r\n    1891.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _THE DAWN OF LIFE._\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DEDICATED TO THE MEMORY OF\r\n\r\n                         SIR WILLIAM E.

Can we name it, explain its structure,\r\nand state its relations to its successors? Can we do this by inference\r\nfrom the succeeding types of being; and if so, do our anticipations\r\nagree with any actual reality disinterred from the earth's crust? If we\r\ncould do this, either by inference or actual discovery, how strange it\r\nwould be to know that we had before us even the remains of the first\r\ncreature that could feel or will, and could place itself in vital\r\nrelation with the great powers of inanimate nature. If we believe in a\r\nCreator, we shall feel it a solemn thing to have access to the first\r\ncreature into which He breathed the breath of life. If we hold that all\r\nthings have been evolved from collision of dead forces, then the first\r\nmolecules of matter which took upon themselves the responsibility of\r\nliving, and, aiming at the enjoyment of happiness, subjected themselves\r\nto the dread alternatives of pain and mortality, must surely evoke\r\nfrom us that filial reverence which we owe to the authors of our own\r\nbeing; if they do not involuntarily draw forth even a superstitious\r\nadoration. The veneration of the old Egyptian for his sacred animals\r\nwould be a comparatively reasonable idolatry, if we could imagine any\r\nof these animals to have been the first that emerged from the domain\r\nof dead matter, and the first link in a reproductive chain of being\r\nthat produced all the population of the world. Independently of any\r\nsuch hypotheses, all students of nature must regard with surpassing\r\ninterest the first bright streaks of light that break on the long reign\r\nof primeval night and death, and presage the busy day of teeming animal\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nNo wonder, then, that geologists have long and earnestly groped in\r\nthe rocky archives of the earth in search of some record of this\r\npatriarch of the animal kingdom. But after long and patient research\r\nthere still remained a large residuum of the oldest rocks destitute\r\nof all traces of living beings, and designated by the hopeless name\r\n\"Azoic,\"--the formations destitute of remains of life, the stony records\r\nof a lifeless world. So the matter remained till the Laurentian rocks\r\nof Canada, lying at the base of these old Azoic formations, afforded\r\nforms believed to be of organic origin. The discovery was hailed\r\nwith enthusiasm by those who had been prepared by previous study to\r\nreceive it. It was regarded with feeble and not very intelligent faith\r\nby many more, and was met with half-concealed or open scepticism by\r\nothers. It produced a copious crop of descriptive and controversial\r\nliterature, but for the most part technical, and confined to scientific\r\ntransactions and periodicals, read by very few except specialists.\r\nThus, few even of geological and biological students have clear ideas\r\nof the real nature and mode of occurrence of these ancient organisms,\r\nif organisms they are, and of their relations to better known forms of\r\nlife; while the crudest and most inaccurate ideas have been current in\r\nlectures and popular books, and even in text-books.\r\n\r\nThis state of things has long ceased to be desirable in the interests\r\nof science, since the settlement of the questions raised is in the\r\nhighest degree important to the history of life. We cannot, it is\r\ntrue, affirm that Eozoon is in reality the long-sought prototype of\r\nanimal existence; but it was for us, at least until recently, the last\r\norganic foothold, on which we can poise ourselves, that we may look\r\nback into the abyss of the infinite past, and forward to the long\r\nand varied progress of life in geological time. Now, however, we\r\nhave announcements to be referred to in the sequel of other organisms\r\ndiscovered in the so-called Archæan rocks; and it is not improbable\r\nthat these will rapidly increase. The discussion of its claims has\r\nalso raised questions and introduced new points, certain, if properly\r\nentered into, to be fruitful of interesting and valuable thought, and\r\nto form a good introduction to the history of life in connection with\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nAs we descend in depth and time into the earth's crust, after passing\r\nthrough nearly all the vast series of strata constituting the monuments\r\nof geological history, we at length reach the Eozoic or Laurentian\r\nrocks,[47] deepest and oldest of all the formations known to the\r\ngeologist, and more thoroughly altered or metamorphosed by heat and\r\nheated moisture than any others. These rocks, at one time known as\r\nAzoic, being supposed destitute of all remains of living things, but\r\nnow more properly Eozoic, are those in which the first bright streaks\r\nof the dawn of life make their appearance.\r\n\r\n[47] Otherwise named \"Archæan.\"\r\n\r\nThe name Laurentian, given originally to the Canadian development of\r\nthese rocks by Sir William Logan, but now applied to them throughout\r\nthe world, is derived from a range of hills lying north of the\r\nSt. Lawrence valley, which the old French geographers named the\r\nLaurentides. In these hills the harder rocks of this old formation rise\r\nto considerable heights, and form the highlands separating the St.\r\nLawrence valley from the great plain fronting on Hudson's Bay and the\r\nArctic Sea. At first sight it may seem strange that rocks so ancient\r\nshould anywhere appear at the surface, especially on the tops of\r\nhills; but this is a necessary result of the mode of formation of our\r\ncontinents. The most ancient sediments deposited in the sea were those\r\nfirst elevated into land, and first altered and hardened. Upheaved in\r\nthe folding of the earth's crust into high and rugged ridges, they have\r\neither remained uncovered with newer sediments, or have had such as\r\nwere deposited on them washed away; and being of a hard and resisting\r\nnature, they have remained comparatively unworn when rocks much more\r\nmodern have been swept off by denuding agencies.[48]\r\n\r\n[48] This implies the permanence of continents in their main features,\r\na doctrine the writer has maintained for thirty years, and which is\r\ndiscussed elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut the exposure of the old Laurentian skeleton of mother earth is not\r\nconfined to the Laurentide Hills, though these have given the formation\r\nits name. The same ancient rocks appear in the Adirondack mountains\r\nof New York, and in the patches which at lower levels protrude from\r\nbeneath the newer formations along the American coast from Newfoundland\r\nto Maryland. The older gneisses of Norway, Sweden, and the Hebrides,\r\nof Bavaria and Bohemia, of Egypt, Abyssinia and Arabia, belong to the\r\nsame age, and it is not unlikely that similar rocks in many other parts\r\nof the old continent will be found to be of as great antiquity. In no\r\npart of the world, however, are the Laurentian rocks more extensively\r\ndistributed or better known than in Canada; and to this as the grandest\r\nand most instructive development of them we may more especially devote\r\nour attention.\r\n\r\nThe Laurentian rocks, associated with another series only a little\r\nyounger, the Huronian, form a great belt of broken and hilly country,\r\nextending from Labrador across the north of Canada to Lake Superior,\r\nand thence bending northward to the Arctic Sea. Everywhere on the lower\r\nSt. Lawrence they appear as ranges of billowy rounded ridges on the\r\nnorth side of the river, and as viewed from the water or the southern\r\nshore, especially when sunset deepens their tints to blue and violet,\r\nthey present a grand and massive appearance, which, in the eye of\r\nthe geologist, who knows that they have endured the battles and the\r\nstorms of time longer than any other mountains, invests them with the\r\ndignity which their mere elevation would fail to give. (Fig. 1.) In the\r\nisolated mass of the Adirondacks, south of the Canadian frontier, they\r\nrise to a still greater elevation, and form an imposing mountain group,\r\nalmost equal in height to their somewhat more modern rivals, the White\r\nMountains, which face them on the opposite side of Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\nThe grandeur of the old Laurentian ranges is, however, best displayed\r\nwhere they have been cut across by the great transverse gorge of the\r\nSaguenay, and where the magnificent precipices, known as Capes Trinity\r\nand Eternity, look down from their elevation of 1,500 feet on the\r\nfiord, which at their feet is more than 100 fathoms deep. The name\r\nEternity applied to such a mass is geologically scarcely a misnomer,\r\nfor it dates back to the very dawn of geological time, and is of hoar\r\nantiquity in comparison with such upstart ranges as the Andes and the\r\nAlps. (See Frontispiece.)\r\n\r\nOn a nearer acquaintance, the Laurentian country appears as a broken\r\nand hilly upland and highland district, clad in its pristine state\r\nwith magnificent forests, but affording few attractions to the\r\nagriculturist, except in the valleys, which follow the lines of its\r\nsofter beds, while it is a favourite region for the angler, the\r\nhunter, and the lumberman. Many of the Laurentian townships of Canada\r\nare, however, already extensively settled, and the traveller may pass\r\nthrough a succession of more or less cultivated valleys, bounded by\r\nrocks or wooded hills and crags, and diversified by running streams and\r\nromantic lakes and ponds, constituting a country always picturesque\r\nand often beautiful, and rearing a strong and hardy population. To\r\nthe geologist it presents in the main immensely thick beds of gneiss,\r\nbedded diorite and quartzite, and similar crystalline rocks, contorted\r\nin the most remarkable manner, so that if they could be flattened out\r\nthey would serve as a skin much too large for mother earth in her\r\npresent state, so much has she shrunk and wrinkled since those youthful\r\ndays when the Laurentian rocks were her outer covering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Laurentian Hills opposite Kamouraska, Lower St.\r\nLawrence. The islands in front are Cambro-Silurian.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--Section from Petite Nation Seigniory to St.\r\nJerome (60 miles). After Sir W. E. Logan.\r\n\r\n(_a b_) Upper Laurentian. (_c_) Fourth Gneiss. (_d´_) Third Limestone.\r\n(_d_) Third Gneiss. (_e´_) Second Limestone. (_x_) Porphyry. (_y_)\r\nGranite.]\r\n\r\nI cannot describe such rocks, but their names, as given in the section,\r\nFig. 2, will tell something to those who have any knowledge of the\r\nolder crystalline materials of the earth's crust. To those who have\r\nnot, I would advise a visit to some cliff on the lower St. Lawrence,\r\nor the Hebridean coasts, or the shore of Norway, where the old hard\r\ncrystalline and gnarled beds present their sharp edges to the ever\r\nraging sea, and show their endless alternations of various kinds\r\nand colours of strata, often diversified with veins and nests of\r\ncrystalline minerals. He who has seen and studied such a section of\r\nLaurentian rock cannot forget it.\r\n\r\nThe elaborate stratigraphical work of Sir William Logan has proved\r\nthat these old crystalline rocks are bedded or stratified, and that\r\nthey must have been deposited in succession by some process of aqueous\r\naction. They have, however, through geological ages of vast duration\r\nbeen subjected to pressure and chemical action, which have, as stated\r\nin a previous chapter, much modified their structure, while it is also\r\ncertain that they must have differed originally from the sands, clays\r\nand other materials laid down in the sea in later times.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice here that the Laurentian rocks thus\r\ninterpreted show that the oldest known portions of our continents were\r\nformed in the waters. They are oceanic sediments deposited perhaps when\r\nthere was no dry land, or very little, and that little unknown to us,\r\nexcept in so far as its _débris_ may have entered into the composition\r\nof the Laurentian rocks themselves. Thus the earliest condition of the\r\nearth known to the geologist is one in which old ocean was already\r\ndominant on its surface; and any previous condition when the surface\r\nwas heated, and the water constituted an abyss of vapours enveloping\r\nits surface, or any still earlier condition in which the earth was\r\ngaseous or vaporous, is a matter of mere inference, not of actual\r\nobservation. The formless and void chaos is a deduction of chemical and\r\nphysical principles, not a fact observed by the geologist. Still we\r\nknow, from the great dykes and masses of igneous or molten rock which\r\ntraverse the Laurentian beds, that even at that early period there\r\nwere deep-seated fires beneath the crust; and it is quite possible\r\nthat volcanic agencies then manifested themselves, not only with quite\r\nas great intensity, but also in the same manner, as at subsequent\r\ntimes. It is thus not unlikely that much of the land undergoing\r\nwaste in the earlier Laurentian time was of the same nature with\r\nrecent volcanic ejections, and that it formed groups of islands in an\r\notherwise boundless ocean.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the distribution and extent of these\r\npre-Laurentian lands is, and probably ever must be, unknown to us; for\r\nit was only after the Laurentian rocks had been deposited, and after\r\nthe shrinkage and deformation of the earth's crust in subsequent times\r\nhad bent and contorted them, that the foundations of the continents\r\nwere laid. The rude sketch map of America given in Fig. 3 will show\r\nthis, and will also show that the old Laurentian mountains mark out the\r\nfuture form of the American continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--The Laurentian Nucleus of the American\r\nContinent, after Dana.]\r\n\r\nSome subsequent writers have, it is true, treated with disbelief\r\nLogan's great discoveries; but no competent geologist who has traced\r\nthe regularly bedded limestones and other rocks of his original fields\r\nof investigation could continue to doubt. On this subject I may quote\r\nfrom my friend Dr. Bonney, one of the most judicious of the builders\r\nwho undertake hypothetically to lay the foundation stones of the\r\nearth's crust for our enlightenment in these later days. In an address\r\ndelivered at the Bath meeting of the British Association he says:--\r\n\r\n\"The first deposits on the solidified crust of the earth would\r\nobviously be igneous. As water condensed from the atmosphere on the\r\ncooling surface, aqueous waste or condensation would begin, and\r\nstratified deposits in the ocean would become possible in addition\r\nto detrital volcanic material. But at that time the crust itself, and\r\neven later stratified deposits would often be kept for a considerable\r\nperiod at a high temperature. Thus, not only rocks of igneous origin\r\n(including volcanic ashes) would predominate in the lowest foundation\r\nstones, but also secondary changes would occur more readily, and even\r\nthe sediments or precipitates might be greatly modified. As time went\r\non, true sediments would predominate over volcanic materials, and these\r\nwould be less and less affected by chemical changes, and would more and\r\nmore retain their original character. Thus we should expect that as we\r\nretraced the earth's course through 'the corridor of time' we should\r\narrive at rocks which, though crystalline in structure, were evidently\r\nin great part sedimentary in origin, and should behind them find rocks\r\nof more coarsely crystalline texture and more dubious character, which,\r\nhowever, probably were in part of a like origin, and should at last\r\nreach coarsely crystalline rocks, in which, while occasional sediments\r\nwould be possible, the majority were originally igneous, though\r\nmodified at a very early period of their history. This corresponds with\r\nwhat we find in nature, when we apply, cautiously and tentatively,\r\nthe principles of interpretation which guide us in stratigraphical\r\ngeology.\"[49]\r\n\r\n[49] \"The Foundation Stones of the Earth's Crust,\" 1888. The extract is\r\nslightly condensed.\r\n\r\nThis expresses very well the general result of the patient\r\nstratigraphical and chemical labours of Logan and Sterry Hunt, as\r\napplied to the vast areas of old crystalline stratified rocks in\r\nCanada, and which I have had abundant opportunities to verify on the\r\nground. Under the undoubted Cambrian beds of Canada lies the Huronian,\r\na formation largely of hardened sands, clays and gravels, now forming\r\nsandstones, slates, and conglomerates, but with great beds of igneous\r\nor volcanic rock, and hardened and altered ash beds. Under this, in\r\nthe upper portion of the Laurentian, we have regularly bedded rocks,\r\nquartzites, limestones, and quartzose, and graphitic and ferruginous\r\ngneisses, evidently altered aqueous sediments; but intermixed with\r\nother rocks, as diorites and hornblendic gneisses, which are plainly\r\nof different origin. Lastly, on the bottom of all, we have nothing but\r\ncoarse crystalline gneiss, representing perhaps the earliest crust\r\nof a cooling globe. Broadly, and without entering into details or\r\ntheoretical views as to the precise causes of formation and alteration\r\nof these rocks, this is the structure of the Archæan or Eozoic system\r\nin Canada; and it corresponds with that of the basement or foundation\r\nstones of our continents in every country that I have been able to\r\nvisit, or of which I have trustworthy accounts.\r\n\r\nIn the lower or fundamental gneiss, and in the igneous beds which\r\nsucceed it, we need not look for any indications of living beings; but\r\nso soon as the sea began to deposit sand, mud, limestone, iron ore,\r\ncarbon, there would be nothing to exclude the presence of some forms of\r\nmarine life; while, as land must have already existed, there would be a\r\npossibility of life on it. This, therefore, we may begin to look for so\r\nsoon as we ascend to those beds of the Laurentian in which limestone,\r\niron ore, and quartzite appear; and it is precisely at this point in\r\nthe Laurentian of Canada that indications of life are supposed to have\r\nbeen found. Certain it is that if we cannot find some sign of life in\r\nthe Laurentian or Huronian, we shall have to face as the beginnings of\r\nlife the swarms of marine creatures that appear all over the globe at\r\nonce, in the early Cambrian age.\r\n\r\nIs it likely, then, that such rocks should afford any traces of living\r\nbeings, even if any such existed when they were formed? Geologists who\r\nhad traced organic remains back to the lowest Cambrian might hope for\r\nsuch remains, even in the Laurentian; but they long looked in vain\r\nfor their actual discovery. Still, as astronomers have suspected the\r\nexistence of unknown planets from observing perturbations not accounted\r\nfor, and as voyagers have suspected the approach to unknown regions\r\nby the appearance of floating wood or stray land birds, anticipations\r\nof such discoveries have been entertained and expressed from time to\r\ntime. Lyell, Dana, and Dr. Sterry Hunt more especially have committed\r\nthemselves to such speculations. The reasons assigned may be stated\r\nthus:--\r\n\r\nAssuming the Laurentian rocks to be altered sediments, they must, from\r\ntheir great extent, have been deposited in the ocean; and if there had\r\nbeen no living creatures in the waters, we have no reason to believe\r\nthat they would have consisted of anything more than such sandy and\r\nmuddy _débris_ as may be washed away from wasting rocks originally of\r\nigneous origin. But the Laurentian beds contain other materials than\r\nthese. No formations of any geological age include thicker or more\r\nextensive limestones. One of the beds measured by the officers of the\r\nGeological Survey is stated to be 1,500 feet in thickness, another is\r\n1,250 feet thick, and a third, 750 feet; making an aggregate of 3,500\r\nfeet.[50] These beds may be traced, with more or less interruption,\r\nfor hundreds of miles. Whatever the origin of such limestones, it\r\nis plain that they indicate causes equal in extent, and comparable\r\nin power and duration, with those which have produced the greatest\r\nlimestones of the later geological periods. Now, in later formations,\r\nlimestone is usually an organic rock, accumulated by the slow gathering\r\nfrom the sea-water, or its plants, of calcareous matter, by corals,\r\nforaminifera, or shell fish, and the deposition of their skeletons,\r\neither entire or in fragments, in the sea bottom. The most friable\r\nchalk and the most crystalline limestones have alike been formed in\r\nthis way. We know of no reason why it should be different in the\r\nLaurentian period. When, therefore, we find great and conformable\r\nbeds of limestone, such as those described by Sir William Logan in\r\nthe Laurentian of Canada, we naturally imagine a quiet sea bottom, in\r\nwhich multitudes of animals of humble organization were accumulating\r\nlimestone in their hard parts, and depositing this in gradually\r\nincreasing thickness from age to age. Any attempts to account otherwise\r\nfor these thick and greatly extended beds, regularly interstratified\r\nwith other deposits, have so far been failures, and have arisen either\r\nfrom a want of comprehension of the nature and magnitude of the\r\nappearances to be explained, or from the error of mistaking the true\r\nbedded limestones for veins of calcareous spar.\r\n\r\n[50] Logan: \"Geology of Canada,\" p. 45.\r\n\r\nThe Laurentian rocks contain great quantities of carbon, in the form of\r\ngraphite or plumbago. This does not occur wholly, or even principally,\r\nin veins or fissures, but in the substance of the limestone and gneiss,\r\nand in regular layers. So abundant is it, that I have estimated the\r\namount of carbon in one division of the Lower Laurentian of the Ottawa\r\ndistrict at an aggregate thickness of not less than twenty to thirty\r\nfeet, an amount comparable with that in the true coal formation itself.\r\nNow we know of no agency existing in present or in past geological\r\ntime capable of deoxidizing carbonic acid, and fixing its carbon as\r\nan ingredient in permanent rocks, except vegetable life. Unless,\r\ntherefore, we suppose that there existed in the Laurentian age a vast\r\nabundance of vegetation, either in the sea or on the land, we have no\r\nmeans of explaining the Laurentian graphite.\r\n\r\nThe Laurentian formation contains great beds of oxide of iron,\r\nsometimes seventy feet in thickness. Here, again, we have an evidence\r\nof organic action; for it is the deoxidizing power of vegetable matter\r\nwhich has in all the later formations been the efficient cause in\r\nproducing bedded deposits of iron. This is the case in modern bog and\r\nlake ores, in the clay ironstones of the coal measures, and apparently,\r\nalso, in the great ore beds of the Silurian rocks. May not similar\r\ncauses have been at work in the Laurentian period?\r\n\r\nAny one of these reasons might, in itself, be held insufficient to\r\nprove so great and, at first sight, unlikely a conclusion as that of\r\nthe existence of abundant animal and vegetable life in the Laurentian;\r\nbut the concurrence of the whole in a series of deposits unquestionably\r\nmarine, forms a chain of evidence so powerful that it might command\r\nbelief even if no fragment of any organic and living form or structure\r\nhad ever been recognised in these ancient rocks.\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition of the matter until the existence of supposed\r\norganic remains was announced by Sir W. Logan, at the American\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Science, in Springfield, in 1859;\r\nand we may now proceed to narrate the manner of this discovery, and how\r\nit has been followed up.\r\n\r\nBefore doing so, however, let us visit Eozoon in one of its haunts\r\namong the Laurentian Hills. One of the most noted repositories of\r\nits remains is the great Grenville band of limestone; and one of the\r\nmost fruitful localities is at a place called Côte St. Pierre on this\r\nband. Leaving the train at Papineauville, we find ourselves on the\r\nLaurentian rocks, and pass over one of the great bands of gneiss for\r\nabout twelve miles, to the village of St. André Avelin. On the road we\r\nsee on either hand abrupt rocky ridges, partially clad with forest, and\r\nsometimes showing on their flanks the stratification of the gneiss in\r\nvery distinct parallel bands, often contorted, as if the rocks, when\r\nsoft, had been wrung as a washerwoman wrings clothes. Between the hills\r\nare little irregular valleys, from which the wheat and oats have just\r\nbeen reaped, and the tall Indian corn and yellow pumpkins are still\r\nstanding in the fields. Where not cultivated, the land is covered with\r\na rich second growth of young maples, birches, and oaks, among which\r\nstill stand the stumps and tall scathed trunks of enormous pines, which\r\nconstituted the original forest. Half way we cross the Nation River,\r\na stream nearly as large as the Tweed, flowing placidly between wooded\r\nbanks, which are mirrored in its surface; but in the distance we can\r\nhear the roar of its rapids, dreaded by lumberers in their spring\r\ndrivings of logs. Arrived at St. André, we find a wider valley, the\r\nindication of the change to the limestone band, and along this, with\r\nthe gneiss hills still in view on either hand, and often encroaching\r\non the road, we drive for five miles more to Côte St. Pierre. At this\r\nplace the lowest depression of the valley is occupied by a little pond,\r\nand, hard by, the limestone, protected by a ridge of gneiss, rises in\r\nan abrupt wooded bank by the roadside, and a little farther forms a\r\nbare white promontory, projecting into the fields.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Attitude of Limestone at St. Pierre, (_a_)\r\nGneiss band in the Limestone, (_b_) Limestone with Eozoon. (_c_)\r\nDiorite and Gneiss.]\r\n\r\nThe limestone is here highly inclined and much contorted, and in all\r\nthe excavations a thickness of about 100 feet of it may be exposed.\r\nIt is white and crystalline, varying much, however, in coarseness in\r\ndifferent bands. It is in some layers pure and white; in others it\r\nis traversed by many grey layers of gneissose and other matter, or\r\nby irregular bands and nodules of pyroxene and serpentine, and it\r\ncontains subordinate beds of dolomite. In one layer only, and this\r\nbut a few feet thick, does the Eozoon occur in abundance in a perfect\r\nstate, though fragments and imperfectly preserved specimens abound\r\nin other parts of the bed. It is a great mistake to suppose that it\r\nconstitutes whole beds of rock in an uninterrupted mass. Its true mode\r\nof occurrence is best seen on the weathered surfaces of the rock, where\r\nthe serpentinous specimens project in irregular patches of various\r\nsizes, sometimes twisted by the contortion of the beds, but often too\r\nsmall to suffer in this way. On such surfaces the projecting patches\r\nof the fossil exhibit laminæ of serpentine so precisely like the\r\n_Stromatoporæ_ of the Silurian rocks, that any collector would pounce\r\nupon them at once as fossils. In some places these small weathered\r\nspecimens can be easily chipped off from the crumbling surface of the\r\nlimestone; and it is perhaps to be regretted that they have not been\r\nmore extensively shown to palæontologists, with the cut slices which\r\nto many of them are so problematical. One of the original specimens,\r\nbrought from the Calumet, and now in the Museum of the Geological\r\nSurvey of Canada, was of this kind, and much finer specimens from\r\nCôte St. Pierre are now in that collection and in my own. A very fine\r\nexample is represented on the plate facing this chapter, which is taken\r\nfrom an original photograph. In some of the layers are found other\r\nand more minute vesicular forms, which may be organic, and these,\r\ntogether with fragmental remains, as ingredients in the limestone, will\r\nbe discussed in the sequel. We may merely notice here that the most\r\nabundant layer of Eozoon at this place occurs near the base of the\r\ngreat limestone band, and that the upper layers, in so far as seen,\r\nare less rich in it. Further, there is no necessary connection between\r\nEozoon and the occurrence of serpentine, for there are many layers\r\nfull of bands and lenticular masses of that mineral without any Eozoon\r\nexcept occasional fragments, while the fossil is sometimes partially\r\nmineralised with pyroxene, dolomite, or common limestone. The section\r\nin Fig. 4 will serve to show the attitude of the limestone at this\r\nplace, while the more general section, Fig. 2, page 101, taken from\r\nSir William Logan, shows its relation to the other Laurentian rocks.\r\n\r\nWe may now notice the manner in which the specimens discovered in this\r\nand other places in the Laurentian country came to be regarded as\r\norganic.\r\n\r\nIt is a trite remark that most discoveries are made, not by one\r\nperson, but by the joint exertions of many, and that they have their\r\npreparations made often long before they actually appear. For this\r\nreason I may be excused here for introducing some personal details in\r\nrelation to the discovery of Eozoon, and which are indeed necessary in\r\nvindication of its claims. In this case the stable foundations were\r\nlaid years before the discovery of Eozoon, by the careful surveys made\r\nby Sir William Logan and his assistants, and the chemical examination\r\nof the rocks and minerals by Dr. Sterry Hunt, which established beyond\r\nall doubt the great age and truly bedded character of the Laurentian\r\nrocks and their probable original nature, and the changes which they\r\nhave experienced in the course of geological time. On the other hand,\r\nDr. Carpenter and others in England were examining the structure of the\r\nshells of the humbler inhabitants of the modern ocean, and the manner\r\nin which the pores of their skeletons become infiltrated with mineral\r\nmatter when deposited in the sea bottom. These laborious and apparently\r\ndissimilar branches of scientific inquiry were destined to be united by\r\na series of happy discoveries, made not fortuitously but by painstaking\r\nand intelligent observers. The discovery of the most ancient fossil\r\nwas thus not the chance picking up of a rare and curious specimen. It\r\nwas not likely to be found in this way; and if so found, it would have\r\nremained unnoticed and of no scientific value, but for the accumulated\r\nstores of zoological and palæontological knowledge, and the surveys\r\npreviously made, whereby the age and distribution of the Laurentian\r\nrocks and the chemical conditions of their deposition and metamorphism\r\nwere ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe first specimens of Eozoon ever procured, in so far as known, were\r\ncollected at Burgess, in Ontario, by a veteran Canadian mineralogist,\r\nDr. Wilson, of Perth, and were sent to Sir William Logan as mineral\r\nspecimens. Their chief interest at that time lay in the fact that\r\ncertain laminæ of a dark green mineral present in the specimens were\r\nfound, on analysis by Dr. Hunt, to be composed of a new hydrous\r\nsilicate, allied to serpentine, and which he named loganite. The form\r\nof this mineral was not suspected to be of organic origin. Some years\r\nafter, in 1858, other specimens, differently mineralized with the\r\nminerals serpentine and pyroxene, were found by Mr. J. McMullen, an\r\nexplorer in the service of the Geological Survey, in the limestone\r\nof the Grand Calumet on the River Ottawa. These seem to have at once\r\nstruck Sir W. E. Logan as resembling the Silurian fossils known as\r\n_Stromatopora_, and he showed them to Mr. Billings, the palæontologist\r\nof the survey, and to the writer, with this suggestion, confirming\r\nit with the sagacious consideration that inasmuch as the Ottawa and\r\nBurgess specimens were mineralized by different substances, yet were\r\nalike in form, there was little probability that they were merely\r\nmineral or concretionary. Mr. Billings was naturally unwilling to risk\r\nhis reputation in affirming the organic nature of such specimens;\r\nand my own suggestion was that they should be sliced, and examined\r\nmicroscopically, and that if fossils, as they presented merely\r\nconcentric laminæ and no cells, they would probably prove to be\r\nprotozoa rather than corals. A few slices were accordingly made, but\r\nno definite structure could be detected. Nevertheless, Sir William\r\nLogan took some of the specimens to the meeting of the American\r\nAssociation at Springfield, in 1859, and exhibited them as possibly\r\nLaurentian fossils; but the announcement was evidently received with\r\nsome incredulity. In 1862 they were exhibited by Sir William to some\r\ngeological friends in London, but he remarks that \"few seemed disposed\r\nto believe in their organic character, with the exception of my friend,\r\nProfessor Ramsay.\" In 1863 the general Report of the Geological Survey,\r\nsumming up its work to that time, was published, under the name of the\r\n\"Geology of Canada,\" and in this, at page 49, will be found two figures\r\nof one of the Calumet specimens, here reproduced, and which, though\r\nunaccompanied with any specific name or technical description, were\r\nreferred to as probably Laurentian fossils. (Figs. 5 and 6.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.--Small specimen of Eozoon, weathered out,\r\nnatural size, from a photograph.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.--Canal System of Eozoon injected with serpentine (magnified).\r\n\r\nFig. 3.--Very fine Canals and Tubuli filled with Dolomite (magnified).\r\n\r\n(From Micro-photographs.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Weathered Specimen of Eozoon from the Calumet.\r\n(Collected by Mr. McMullen.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.--Cross Section of the Specimen represented in\r\nFig. 8. The dark parts are the laminæ of calcareous matter converging\r\nto the outer surface.]\r\n\r\nAbout this time Dr. Hunt happened to mention to me, in connection with\r\na paper on the mineralization of fossils which he was preparing, that\r\nhe proposed to notice the mode of preservation of certain fossil woods\r\nand other things with which I was familiar, and that he would show me\r\nthe paper in proof, in order that I might give him any suggestions that\r\noccurred to me. On reading it, I observed, among other things, that\r\nhe alluded to the supposed Laurentian fossils, under the impression\r\nthat the organic part was represented by the serpentine or loganite,\r\nand that the calcareous matter was the filling of the chambers. I took\r\nexception to this, stating that though in the slices I had examined no\r\nstructure was apparent, still my impression was that the calcareous\r\nmatter was the fossil, and the serpentine or loganite the filling. He\r\nsaid--\"In that case, would it not be well to re-examine the specimens,\r\nand try to discover which view is correct?\" He mentioned, at the same\r\ntime, that Sir William had recently shown him some new and beautiful\r\nspecimens collected by Mr. Lowe, one of the explorers on the staff of\r\nthe Survey, from a third locality, at Grenville, on the Ottawa. It\r\nwas supposed that these might throw further light on the subject; and\r\naccordingly Dr. Hunt suggested to Sir William to have additional slices\r\nof these new specimens made by Mr. Weston, of the Survey, whose skill\r\nas a preparer of these and other fossils has often done good service to\r\nscience. A few days thereafter some slices were sent to me, and were\r\nat once put under the microscope. I was delighted to find in one of\r\nthe first specimens examined a beautiful group of tubuli penetrating\r\none of the calcite layers. Here was evidence, not only that the\r\ncalcite layers represented the true skeleton of the fossil, but also\r\nof its affinities with the foraminifera, whose tubulated supplemental\r\nskeleton, as described and figured by Dr. Carpenter, and represented\r\nin specimens in my collection, presented by him, was apparently of the\r\nsame type with that preserved in the canals of these ancient fossils.\r\nFig. 7 is an accurate representation of the group of canals first\r\ndetected by me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.--Group of Canals in the Supplemental Skeleton of\r\nEozoon. Taken from the specimen in which they were first recognised.\r\nMagnified. (Camera tracing by Mr. H. S. Smith.)]\r\n\r\nOn showing the structures discovered to Sir William Logan, he entered\r\ninto the matter with enthusiasm, and had a great number of slices, as\r\nwell as decalcified specimens, prepared, which were placed in my hands\r\nfor examination.\r\n\r\nFeeling that the discovery was most important, but that it would be\r\nmet with determined scepticism by a great many geologists, I was\r\nnot content with examining the typical specimens of Eozoon, but had\r\nslices prepared of every variety of Laurentian limestone, of altered\r\nlimestones from the Primordial and Silurian, and of serpentine\r\nmarbles of all the varieties furnished by our collections. They were\r\nexamined with ordinary and polarized light, and with every variety of\r\nillumination. They were also examined as decalcified specimens, after\r\nthe carbonate of lime had been removed by acids. An extensive series of\r\nnotes and camera tracings were made of all the appearances observed;\r\nand of some of the more important structures beautiful drawings\r\nwere executed by the late Mr. H. S. Smith, the then palæontological\r\ndraughtsman of the Survey. The result of the whole investigation was a\r\nfirm conviction that the structure was organic and foraminiferal, and\r\nthat it could be distinguished from any merely mineral or crystalline\r\nforms occurring in these or other limestones.\r\n\r\nAt this stage of the matter, and after exhibiting to Sir William all\r\nthe characteristic appearances, in comparison with such concretionary,\r\ndendritic and crystalline structures as most resembled them, and also\r\nwith the structure of recent and fossil Foraminifera, I suggested\r\nthat the further prosecution of the matter should be handed over to\r\nMr. Billings, as palæontologist of the Survey. I was engaged in other\r\nresearches, not connected with the Survey or with this particular\r\ndepartment, and I knew that no little labour must be devoted to the\r\nwork and to its publication, and that some controversy might be\r\nexpected. Mr. Billings, however, with his characteristic caution and\r\nmodesty, declined. His hands were full of other work. He had not given\r\nany special attention to the microscopic appearances of Foraminifera or\r\nof mineral substances. It was finally arranged that I should prepare\r\na description of the fossil, which Sir William would take to London,\r\nalong with the more important specimens, and a detailed list stating\r\nall the structures observed in each. Sir William was to submit the\r\nmanuscript and specimens to Dr. Carpenter, or, failing him, to Prof.\r\nT. Rupert Jones, in the hope that these eminent authorities would\r\nconfirm my conclusions, and bring forward new facts which I might\r\nhave overlooked or been ignorant of. Sir William saw both gentlemen,\r\nwho gave their testimony in favour of the organic and foraminiferal\r\ncharacter of the specimens; and Dr. Carpenter, in particular, gave much\r\nattention to the subject, and worked out more in detail many of the\r\nfiner structures, besides contributing valuable suggestions as to the\r\nprobable affinities of the supposed fossil.\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter thus contributed in a very important manner to the\r\nperfecting of the investigations begun in Canada, and on him fell the\r\ngreater part of their illustration and defence,[51] in so far as Great\r\nBritain is concerned.\r\n\r\n[51] In _Quarterly Journal of Geological Society_, vol. xxii.; _Proc.\r\nRoyal Society_, vol. xv.; _Intellectual Observer_, 1865. _Annals and\r\nMagazine of Natural History_, 1874; and other papers and notices.\r\n\r\nThe immediate result was a composite paper in the _Proceedings of the\r\nGeological Society_, by Sir W. E. Logan, Dr. Carpenter, Dr. Hunt, and\r\nmyself, in which the geology, palæontology and mineralogy of _Eozoon\r\nCanadense_ and its containing rocks were first given to the world.[52]\r\nIt cannot be wondered at that when geologists and palæontologists\r\nwere thus required to believe in the existence of organic remains in\r\nrocks regarded as altogether Azoic and hopelessly barren of fossils,\r\nand to carry back the dawn of life as far before those Primordial\r\nrocks, which were supposed to contain its first traces, as these are\r\nbefore the middle period of the earth's life history, some hesitation\r\nshould be felt. Further, the accurate appreciation of the evidence\r\nfor such a fossil as Eozoon required an amount of knowledge of\r\nminerals, of the more humble types of animals, and of the conditions\r\nof mineralization of organic remains, possessed by few even of\r\nprofessional geologists. Thus Eozoon has met with some scepticism and\r\nnot a little opposition,--though the latter has been weaker than we\r\nmight have expected when we consider the startling character of the\r\nfacts adduced, and has mostly come from men imperfectly informed.\r\n\r\n[52] _Journal Geological Society_, February, 1865.\r\n\r\nBut what is Eozoon, if really of animal origin? The shortest answer\r\nto this question is, that this ancient fossil is supposed to be the\r\nskeleton of a creature belonging to that simple and humbly organized\r\ngroup of animals which are known by the name Protozoa. If we take as a\r\nfamiliar example of these the gelatinous and microscopic creature found\r\nin stagnant ponds, and known as the _Amœba_[53] (Fig. 8), it will form\r\na convenient starting-point. Viewed under a low power, it appears as\r\na little patch of jelly, irregular in form, and constantly changing\r\nits aspect as it moves, by the extension of parts of its body into\r\nfinger-like processes or pseudopods which serve as extempore limbs.\r\nWhen moving on the surface of a slip of glass under the microscope,\r\nit seems, as it were, to flow along rather than creep, and its body\r\nappears to be of a semi-fluid consistency. It may be taken as an\r\nexample of the least complex forms of animal life known to us, and is\r\noften spoken of by naturalists as if it were merely a little particle\r\nof living and scarcely organized jelly or protoplasm. When minutely\r\nexamined, however, it will not be found so simple as it at first sight\r\nappears. Its outer layer is clear and transparent, and more dense than\r\nthe inner mass, which seems granular. It has at one end a curious\r\nvesicle which can be seen gradually to expand and become filled with\r\na clear drop of liquid, and then suddenly to contract and expel the\r\ncontained fluid through a series of pores in the adjacent part of\r\nthe outer wall. This is the so-called pulsating vesicle, and is an\r\norgan both of circulation and excretion. In another part of the body\r\nmay be seen the nucleus, which is a little cell capable, at certain\r\ntimes, of producing by its division new individuals. Food, when taken\r\nin through the wall of the body, forms little pellets, which become\r\nsurrounded by a digestive liquid exuded from the enclosing mass into\r\nrounded cavities or extemporised stomachs. Minute granules are seen\r\nto circulate in the gelatinous interior, and may be substitutes for\r\nblood-cells, and the outer layer of the body is capable of protrusion\r\nin any direction into long processes, which are very mobile, and used\r\nfor locomotion and prehension. Further, this creature, though destitute\r\nof most of the parts which we are accustomed to regard as proper to\r\nanimals, seems to exercise volition, and to show the same appetites\r\nand passions with animals of higher type. I have watched one of these\r\nanimalcules endeavouring to swallow a one-celled plant as long as its\r\nown body; evidently hungry and eager to devour the tempting morsel, it\r\nstretched itself to its full extent, trying to envelope the object of\r\nits desire. It failed again and again; but renewed the attempt, until\r\nat length, convinced of its hopelessness, it flung itself away as if in\r\ndisappointment, and made off in search of something more manageable.\r\nWith the Amœba are found other types of equally simple Protozoa, but\r\nsomewhat differently organized. One of these, _Actinophrys_ (Fig. 9),\r\nhas the body globular and unchanging in form, the outer wall of greater\r\nthickness; the pulsating vesicle like a blister on the surface, and the\r\npseudopods long and thread-like. Its habits are similar to those of the\r\nAmœba, and I introduce it to show the variations of form and structure\r\npossible even among these simple creatures.\r\n\r\n[53] The alternating animal, alluding to its change of form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Amœba. Fig. 9. Actinophrys.\r\n\r\nFrom original sketches.]\r\n\r\nThe Amœba and Actinophrys are fresh-water animals, and are destitute\r\nof any shell or covering. But in the sea there exist swarms of similar\r\ncreatures, equally simple in organization, but gifted with the power of\r\nsecreting around their soft bodies beautiful little shells or crusts of\r\ncarbonate of lime, having one orifice, and often in addition multitudes\r\nof microscopic pores through which the soft gelatinous matter can ooze,\r\nand form outside finger-like or thread-like extensions for collecting\r\nfood. In some cases the shell consists of a single cavity only, but in\r\nmost, after one cell is completed, others are added, forming a series\r\nof cells or chambers communicating with each other, and often arranged\r\nspirally or otherwise in most beautiful and symmetrical forms. Some of\r\nthese creatures, usually named Foraminifera, are locomotive, others\r\nsessile and attached. Most of them are microscopic, but some grow by\r\nmultiplication of chambers till they are a quarter of an inch or more\r\nin breadth.\r\n\r\nThe original skeleton or primary cell wall of most of these creatures\r\nis seen under the microscope to be perforated with innumerable pores,\r\nand is extremely thin. When, however, owing to the increased size of\r\nthe shell, or other wants of the creature, it is necessary to give\r\nstrength, this is done by adding new portions of carbonate of lime to\r\nthe outside, and to these Dr. Carpenter has given the appropriate name\r\nof \"supplemental skeleton\"; and this, when covered by new growths,\r\nbecomes what he has termed an \"intermediate skeleton.\" The supplemental\r\nskeleton is also traversed by tubes, but these are often of larger\r\nsize than the pores of the cell wall, and of greater length, and\r\nbranched in a complicated manner. Thus there are microscopic characters\r\nby which these curious shells can be distinguished from those of\r\nother marine animals; and by applying these characters we learn that\r\nmultitudes of creatures of this type have existed in former periods of\r\nthe world's history, and that their shells, accumulated in the bottom\r\nof the sea, constitute large portions of many limestones. The manner in\r\nwhich such accumulation takes place we learn from what is now going on\r\nin the ocean, more especially from the result of the recent deep-sea\r\ndredging expeditions. The Foraminifera are vastly numerous, both near\r\nthe surface and at the bottom of the sea, and multiply rapidly; and as\r\nsuccessive generations die, their shells accumulate on the ocean bed,\r\nor are swept by currents into banks, and thus, in process of time,\r\nconstitute thick beds of white chalky material, which may eventually\r\nbe hardened into limestone. This process is now depositing a great\r\nthickness of white ooze in the bottom of the ocean; and in times past\r\nit has produced such vast thicknesses of calcareous matter as the chalk\r\nand nummulitic limestone of Europe and the orbitoidal limestone of\r\nAmerica. The chalk which alone attains a maximum thickness of 1,000\r\nfeet, and, according to Lyell, can be traced across Europe for 1,100\r\ngeographical miles, may be said to be entirely composed of shells of\r\nForaminifera imbedded in a paste of smaller calcareous bodies, the\r\nCoccoliths, which are probably products of marine vegetable life, if\r\nnot of some animal organism still simpler than the Foraminifera.\r\n\r\nLastly, while we have in such modern forms as the masses of\r\nPolytrema attached to corals, and the Loftusia of the Eocene and the\r\ncarboniferous, large fossil foraminiferal species, there is some reason\r\nto believe that in the earlier geological ages there existed much\r\nlarger animals of this grade than are found in our present seas; and\r\nthat these, always sessile on the bottom, grew by the addition of\r\nsuccessive chambers, in the same manner with the smaller species.[54]\r\n\r\n[54] I refer to some of the Stromatoporæ of the Silurian and the\r\n_Cryptozoon_ of the Cambrian. See note appended to this chapter.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, examine the structure of Eozoon, taking a typical\r\nspecimen, as we find it in the limestone of Grenville or Petite Nation.\r\nIn such specimens the skeleton of the animal is represented by a white\r\ncrystalline marble, the cavities of the cells by green serpentine, the\r\nmode of whose introduction we shall have to consider in the sequel.\r\nThe lowest layer of serpentine represents the first gelatinous coat\r\nof animal matter which grew upon the bottom, and which, if we could\r\nhave seen it before any shell was formed upon its surface, must have\r\nresembled a minute patch of living slime. On this primary layer grew\r\na delicate calcareous shell, perforated by innumerable minute tubuli,\r\nand resting on the slimy matter of the animal, though supported also\r\nby some perpendicular plates or septa. Upon this again was built up,\r\nin order to strengthen it, a thickening or supplemental skeleton,\r\nmore dense, and destitute of fine tubuli, but traversed by branching\r\ncanals, through which the soft gelatinous matter could pass for the\r\nnourishment of the skeleton itself, and the extension of pseudopods\r\nbeyond it. (Figs. 11, 12.) So was formed the first layer of Eozoon,\r\nwhich probably was at its beginning only of very small dimensions. On\r\nthis the process of growth of successive layers of animal sarcode and\r\nof calcareous skeleton was repeated again and again, till in some cases\r\neven a hundred or more layers were formed (nature-print, Chap. VI.)\r\nAs the process went on, however, the vitality of the organism became\r\nexhausted, probably by the deficient nourishment of the central and\r\nlower layers making greater and greater demands on those above, and so\r\nthe succeeding layers became thinner, and less supplemental skeleton\r\nwas developed. Finally, toward the top, the regular arrangement in\r\nlayers was abandoned, and the cells became a mass of rounded chambers,\r\nirregularly piled up in what Dr. Carpenter has termed an \"acervuline\"\r\nmanner, and with very thin walls unprotected by supplemental skeleton.\r\nThen the growth was arrested, and possibly these upper layers gave\r\noff reproductive germs, fitted to float or swim away and to establish\r\nnew colonies. We may have such reproductive germs in certain curious\r\nglobular bodies, like loose cells, found in connection with Eozoon in\r\nmany of the Laurentian limestones.[55] At St. Pierre, on the Ottawa,\r\nthese bodies occur on the surface of layers of the limestone in vast\r\nnumbers, as if they had been growing separately on the bottom, or had\r\nbeen drifted over it by currents. They may have served as reproductive\r\nbuds or germs to establish new colonies of the species. Such was the\r\ngeneral mode of growth of Eozoon, and we may now consider more in\r\ndetail some questions as to its gigantic size, its precise mode of\r\nnutrition, the arrangement of its parts, its relations to more modern\r\nforms, and the effects of its growth in the Laurentian seas.\r\n\r\n[55] It would be interesting to compare these bodies with the forms\r\nrecently found by Barrois and Cayeux in the \"Azoic\" quartzite of\r\nBrittany, which should certainly now be called Eozoic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.--Minute Foraminiferal forms from the Laurentian\r\nof Long Lake. Highly magnified, (_a_) Single cell, showing tubulated\r\nwall. (_b, c_) Portions of same more highly magnified. (_d_) Serpentine\r\ncast of a similar chamber, decalcified, and showing casts of tubuli.]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the size of Eozoon, this was rivalled by some\r\nsucceeding animals of the same humble type in later geological ages;\r\nand, as a whole, foraminiferal animals have been diminishing in\r\nsize in the lapse of geological time. This is indeed a fact of so\r\nfrequent occurrence that it may almost be regarded as a law of the\r\nintroduction of new forms of life, that they assume in their early\r\nhistory gigantic dimensions, and are afterwards continued by less\r\nmagnificent species. The relations of this to external conditions,\r\nin the case of higher animals, are often complex and difficult to\r\nunderstand; but in organisms so low as Eozoon and its allies, they lie\r\nmore on the surface. Such creatures may be regarded as the simplest and\r\nmost ready media for the conversion of vegetable matter into animal\r\ntissues, and their functions are almost entirely limited to those\r\nof nutrition. Hence it is likely that they will be able to appear\r\nin the most gigantic forms under such conditions as afford them the\r\ngreatest amount of pabulum for the nourishment of their soft parts\r\nand for their skeletons. There is reason to believe, for example,\r\nthat the occurrence, both in the chalk and the deep-sea mud, of\r\nimmense quantities of the minute bodies known as Coccoliths along with\r\nForaminifera, is not accidental. The Coccoliths appear to be grains\r\nof calcareous matter formed in minute plants adapted to a deep-sea\r\nhabitat; and these, along with the vegetable and animal _débris_\r\nconstantly being derived from the death of the living things at the\r\nsurface, afford the material both of sarcode and shell. Now if the\r\nLaurentian graphite represents an exuberance of vegetable growth in\r\nthose old seas proportionate to the great supplies of carbonic acid\r\nin the atmosphere and in the waters, and if the Eozoic ocean was even\r\nbetter supplied with salts of lime than those Silurian seas whose vast\r\nlimestones bear testimony to their richness in such material, we can\r\neasily imagine that the conditions may have been more favourable to a\r\ncreature like Eozoon than those of any other period of geological time.\r\n\r\nGrowing, as Eozoon did, on the floor of the ocean, and covering wide\r\npatches with more or less irregular masses, it must have thrown up from\r\nits whole surface its pseudopods to seize whatever floating particles\r\nof food the waters carried over it. There is also reason to believe,\r\nfrom the outline of certain specimens, that it often grew upward\r\nin conical or club-shaped forms, and that the broader patches were\r\npenetrated by large pits or oscula, admitting the sea-water deeply into\r\nthe substance of the masses. In this way its growth might be rapid and\r\ncontinuous; but it does not seem to have possessed the power of growing\r\nindefinitely by new and living layers covering those that had died,\r\nin the manner of some corals. Its life seems to have had a definite\r\ntermination, and when that was reached, an entirely new colony had to\r\nbe commenced. In this it had more affinity with the Foraminifera, as\r\nwe now know them, than with the corals, though practically it had the\r\nsame power with the coral polyps of accumulating limestone in the sea\r\nbottom--a power indeed still possessed by its foraminiferal successors.\r\nIn the case of coral limestones we know that a large proportion of\r\nthese consist not of continuous reefs, but of fragments of coral mixed\r\nwith other calcareous organisms, spread usually by waves and currents\r\nin continuous beds over the sea bottom. In like manner we find in the\r\nlimestones containing Eozoon, layers of fragmental matter which show\r\nin places the characteristic structures, and which evidently represent\r\nthe _débris_ swept from the Eozoic masses and reefs by the action of\r\nthe waves. It is with this fragmental matter that the small rounded\r\norganisms already referred to most frequently occur; and while they\r\nmay be distinct animals, they may also be the fry of Eozoon, or small\r\nportions of its acervuline upper surface floated off in a living state,\r\nand possibly capable of living independently and of founding new\r\ncolonies.\r\n\r\nIt is only by a somewhat wild poetical licence that Eozoon has been\r\nrepresented as a \"kind of enormous composite animal stretching from the\r\nshores of Labrador to Lake Superior, and thence northward and southward\r\nto an unknown distance, and forming masses 1,500 feet in depth.\" We\r\nmay, it is true, readily believe in the composite nature of masses or\r\nEozoon, and we see in the corals evidence of the great size to which\r\ncomposite animals of a higher grade can attain. In the case of Eozoon\r\nwe must imagine an ocean floor more uniform and level than that now\r\nexisting. On this the organism would establish itself in spots and\r\npatches. These might finally become confluent over large areas, just\r\nas massive corals do. As individual masses attained maturity and died,\r\ntheir pores would be filled up with limestone or silicious deposits,\r\nand thus could form a solid basis for new generations, and in this way\r\nlimestone to an indefinite extent might be produced. Further, wherever\r\nsuch masses were high enough to be attacked by the breakers, or where\r\nportions of the sea bottom were elevated, the more fragile parts of the\r\nsurface would be broken up and scattered widely in beds of fragments\r\nover the bottom of the sea, while here and there beds of mud or sand,\r\nor of volcanic _débris_ would be deposited over the living or dead\r\norganic mass, and would form the layers of gneiss and other schistose\r\nrocks interstratified with the Laurentian limestone. In this way, in\r\nshort, Eozoon would perform a function combining that which corals and\r\nForaminifera perform in the modern seas; forming both reef limestones\r\nand extensive chalky beds, and probably living both in the shallow and\r\nthe deeper parts of the ocean. If in connection with this we consider\r\nthe rapidity with which the soft, simple, and almost structureless\r\nsarcode of these Protozoa can be built up, and the probability that\r\nthey were more abundantly supplied with food, both for nourishing\r\ntheir soft parts and skeletons, than any similar creatures in later\r\ntimes, we can readily understand the great volume and extent of the\r\nLaurentian limestones which they aided in producing. I say aided in\r\nproducing, because I would not care to commit myself to the doctrine\r\nthat the Laurentian limestones are wholly of this origin. There may\r\nhave been other limestone builders than Eozoon, and there may have been\r\nlimestones formed by plants like the modern Nullipores, or by merely\r\nmineral deposition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.--Section of a Nummulite, from Eocene Limestone\r\nof Syria. Showing chambers, tubuli, and canals. Compare this and Fig.\r\n12 with Fig. 7 and Nature-print of Eozoon.]\r\n\r\nIts relations to modern animals of its type have been very clearly\r\ndefined by Dr. Carpenter. In the structure of its proper wall and its\r\nfine parallel perforations, it resembles the _Nummulites_ and their\r\nallies; and the organism may therefore be regarded as an aberrant\r\nmember of the Nummuline group, which affords some of the largest and\r\nmost widely distributed of the fossil Foraminifera. This resemblance\r\nmay be seen in Fig. 11. To the Nummulites it also conforms in its\r\ntendency to form a supplemental or intermediate skeleton with canals,\r\nthough the canals themselves in the arrangement more nearly resemble\r\nCalcarina, which is represented in Fig. 12. In its superposition\r\nof many layers, and in its tendency to a heaped up or acervuline\r\nirregular growth it resembles _Polytrema_ and _Tinoporus_, forms of a\r\ndifferent group in so far as shell-structure is concerned. It may thus\r\nbe regarded as a composite type, combining peculiarities now observed\r\nin two groups, or it may be regarded as representing one of these in\r\nanother series. At the time when Dr. Carpenter stated these affinities,\r\nit might be objected that Foraminifera of these families are in the\r\nmain found in the modern and Tertiary periods. Dr. Carpenter has since\r\nshown that the curious oval Foraminifer called _Fusulina_, found in\r\nthe coal formation, is allied to both Nummulites and Rotalines; and\r\nMr. Brady has discovered a true Nummulite in the Lower Carboniferous\r\nof Belgium. I have myself found small Foraminifera in the Silurian and\r\nCambro-Silurian of Canada. This group being now brought down to the\r\nPalæozoic, we may hope to trace it to the Primordial, and thus to bring\r\nit still nearer to Eozoon in time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Portion of shell of Calcarina. Magnified,\r\nafter Carpenter, (_a_) Cells. (_b_) Original cell wall with tubuli.\r\n(_c_) Supplementary skeleton with canals.]\r\n\r\nThough Eozoon was probably not the only animal of the Laurentian seas,\r\nyet it was in all likelihood the most conspicuous and important as\r\na collector of calcareous matter, filling the same place afterwards\r\noccupied by the reef-building corals. Though probably less efficient\r\nthan these as a constructor of solid limestones, from its less\r\npermanent and continuous growth, it formed wide floors and patches\r\non the sea bottom, and when these were broken up, vast quantities of\r\nlimestone were formed from their _débris_. It must also be borne in\r\nmind that Eozoon was not everywhere infiltrated with serpentine or\r\nother silicious minerals; quantities of its substance were merely\r\nfilled with carbonate of lime, resembling the chamber wall so closely\r\nthat it is nearly impossible to make out the difference, and thus is\r\nlikely to pass altogether unobserved by collectors, and to baffle\r\neven the microscopist. Although, therefore, the layers which contain\r\nwell characterised Eozoon are few and far between, there is reason to\r\nbelieve that in the composition of the limestones of the Laurentian it\r\nbore no small part, and as these limestones are some of them several\r\nhundred feet in thickness, and extend over vast areas, Eozoon may be\r\nsupposed to have been as efficient a world-builder as the Stromatoporæ\r\nof the Silurian and Devonian, the Globigerinæ and their allies in\r\nthe chalk, or the Nummulites and Miliolites in the Eocene. It is a\r\nremarkable illustration of the constancy of natural causes and of\r\nthe persistence of animal types, that these humble Protozoans, which\r\nbegan to secrete calcareous matter in the Laurentian period, have been\r\ncontinuing their work in the ocean through all the geological ages,\r\nand are still busy in accumulating those chalky muds with which recent\r\ndredging operations in the deep sea have made us so familiar. (See Note\r\nappended.)\r\n\r\nAll this seems sufficiently reasonable, more especially since\r\nno mineralogist has yet succeeded in giving a feasible inorganic\r\nexplanation of the combination of canals, laminæ, tubulation and varied\r\nmineral character existing in Eozoon. But then comes the strange fact\r\nof its apparent isolation without companions in highly crystalline\r\nrocks, and with apparently no immediate successors. This has staggered\r\nmany, and it certainly, if taken thus baldly, seems in some degree\r\nimprobable. Recent discoveries, however, are removing this reproach\r\nfrom Eozoon. The Laurentian rocks have yielded other varieties, or\r\nperhaps species of the genus, those which I have described as variety\r\nAcervulina, and variety Minor, and still another form, more like a\r\nStromatopora, which I have provisionally named _E. latior_, from\r\nthe breadth and uniformity of its plates.[56] There are also in the\r\nLaurentian limestone cylindrical bodies apparently originally tubular,\r\nand with the sides showing radiating markings in the manner of corals,\r\nor of the curious Cambrian Archæocyathus. Matthew, a most careful\r\nobserver, has found in the Laurentian limestone of New Brunswick\r\ncertain laminated bodies of cylindrical form, constituting great reefs\r\nin the limestone, and in the slates linear flat objects resembling\r\nAlgæ or Graptolites, and spicular structures resembling those of\r\nsponges.[57] Britton has also described from the Laurentian limestone\r\nof New Jersey certain ribbon-like objects of graphite which he regards\r\nas vegetable, and names _Archæophyton Newberryii_.[58] Should these\r\nobjects prove to be organic, Eozoon will no longer be alone. Besides\r\nthis the peculiar bodies named Cryptozoum by Hall, and which are\r\nintermediate in structure between Eozoon and Loftusia, have now been\r\nfound as low as the Lower Cambrian.[59] Barrois has also recently\r\nannounced the discovery of forms which he regards as akin to the modern\r\nRadiolaria, creatures of a little higher grade than the Foraminifera,\r\nin the \"Archæan\" rocks of Brittany.[60] Thus Eozoon is no longer\r\nisolated, but has companions of the same great age with itself. The\r\nprogress of discovery is also daily carrying the life of the Cambrian\r\nto lower beds, and thus nearer to the Laurentian. It is not unlikely\r\nthat in a few years a pre-Cambrian fauna will force itself on the\r\nattention of the most sceptical geologists.\r\n\r\n[56] Notes on Specimens of Eozoon, \"Memoirs of Peter Redpath Museum,\"\r\n1888.\r\n\r\n[57] _Bul.

To the present writer its use\r\nis no novelty. When, as a very young geologist, collecting fossil\r\nplants in the coal fields of Nova Scotia, I obtained access to the\r\nthen recently published work of Witham on the \"Internal Structure of\r\nFossil Vegetables.\"[61] Fired by the desire to learn something of\r\nthe structure of the blocks of fossil wood in my collection, I at\r\nonce procured a microscope of what would now be considered a very\r\nimperfect kind, and proceeded to make attempts to slice and examine my\r\nspecimens, and was filled with joy when these old blackened stems for\r\nthe first time revealed to me their wonderful structures. At the same\r\ntime I extended my studies to every minute form of life that could be\r\nobtained from the sea or fresh waters. A few years later (in 1841),\r\nwhen a student in Edinburgh, I made the acquaintance of Mr. Sanderson\r\nof that city, who had worked for Nicol and Witham in the preparation of\r\nspecimens, and learnt the modes which he had employed. Since that time\r\nI have been accustomed to subject every rock, earth or fossil which\r\ncame under my notice to microscopic scrutiny, not as a mere specialist\r\nin that mode of observation, or with the parade of methods and details\r\nnow customary, but with the view of obtaining valuable facts bearing\r\non any investigation I might have in hand. It was this habit which\r\ninduced my old friend, Sir William Logan, in 1858 and subsequent years\r\nto ask my aid in the study of the forms believed or suspected to be\r\norganic, which had been discovered in the course of his surveys of the\r\nLaurentian rocks. In one respect this was unfortunate. It occupied\r\nmuch time, interfered to some extent with other researches, led to\r\nunpleasant controversies. But these evils were more than compensated\r\nby the insight which the study gave into the fact of the persistence\r\nof organic structures in highly crystalline rocks, and to the modes\r\nof ascertaining and profiting, by these obscure remains, while it\r\nhas guided and stimulated enquiry and thought as to the origin and\r\nhistory of life. These benefits entitle the researches and discussions\r\non Eozoon to be regarded as marking a salient point in the history\r\nof geological discovery, and it is to these principally that I would\r\nattract attention in the present chapter.\r\n\r\n[61] Edinburgh, 1833.\r\n\r\nPerhaps nothing excites more scepticism as to the animal nature of\r\nEozoon than the prejudice existing among geologists that no organism\r\ncan be preserved in rocks so highly crystalline as those of the\r\nLaurentian series. I call this a prejudice, because any one who makes\r\nthe microscopic structure of rocks and fossils a special study, soon\r\nlearns that fossils and the rocks containing them may undergo the most\r\nremarkable and complete mechanical and chemical changes without losing\r\ntheir minute structure, and that limestones, if once fossiliferous,\r\nare hardly ever so much altered as to lose all traces of the organisms\r\nwhich they contained, while it is a most common occurrence to find\r\nhighly crystalline rocks of this kind abounding in fossils preserved as\r\nto their minute structure.\r\n\r\nLet us, however, look at the precise conditions under which this takes\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nWhen calcareous fossils of irregular surface and porous or cellular\r\ntexture, such as Eozoon may have been, or corals were and are, become\r\nimbedded in clay, marl, or other soft sediment, they can be washed\r\nout and recovered in a condition similar to that of recent specimens,\r\nexcept that their pores or cells, if open, may be filled with the\r\nmaterial of the matrix, or if not so open that they can be thus filled,\r\nthey may be more or less incrusted with mineral deposits introduced\r\nby water percolating the mass, or may even be completely filled up in\r\nthis way. But if such fossils are contained in hard rocks, they usually\r\nfail, when these are broken, to show their external surfaces, and,\r\nbreaking across with the containing rock, they exhibit their internal\r\nstructure merely,--and this more or less distinctly, according to the\r\nmanner in which their cells or cavities have been filled with mineral\r\nmatter. Here the microscope becomes of essential service, especially\r\nwhen the structures are minute. A fragment of fossil wood which to the\r\nnaked eye is nothing but a dark stone, or a coral which is merely a\r\npiece of grey or coloured marble, or a specimen of common crystalline\r\nlimestone made up originally of coral fragments, presents, when sliced\r\nand magnified, the most perfect and beautiful structure. In such cases\r\nit will be found that ordinarily the original substance of the fossil\r\nremains in a more or less altered state. Wood may be represented by\r\ndark lines of coaly matter, or coral by its white or transparent\r\ncalcareous laminæ; while the material which has been introduced, and\r\nwhich fills the cavities, may so differ in colour, transparency, or\r\ncrystallization, as to act differently on light, and so reveal the\r\noriginal structure. These fillings are very curious. Sometimes they are\r\nmere earthy or muddy matter which has been washed into the cavities.\r\nSometimes they are transparent and crystalline. Often they are stained\r\nwith oxide of iron or coaly materials. They may consist of carbonate\r\nof lime, silica or silicates, sulphate of baryta, oxides of iron,\r\ncarbonate of iron, iron pyrite, or sulphides of copper or lead, all of\r\nwhich are common materials. They are sometimes so complicated that I\r\nhave seen even the minute cells of woody structures, each with several\r\nbands of differently coloured materials deposited in succession, like\r\nthe coats of an onyx agate.\r\n\r\nA further stage of mineralisation occurs when the substance of the\r\norganism is altogether removed and replaced by foreign matter, either\r\nlittle by little, or by being entirely dissolved or decomposed,\r\nleaving a cavity to be filled by infiltration. In this state are some\r\nsilicified woods, and those corals which have been not filled with\r\nbut replaced by silica, and can thus sometimes be obtained entire and\r\nperfect by the solution in an acid of the containing limestone, or by\r\nits removal in weathering. In this state are the beautiful silicified\r\ncorals obtained from the corniferous limestone of Lake Erie, which are\r\nso perfectly replaced by flinty matter that when weathered out of the\r\nlimestone, or treated with acid till the latter is removed, we find\r\nthe coral as perfect as when recent. It may be well to present to the\r\neye these different stages of fossilization. I have attempted to do\r\nthis in Fig. 13, taking a tabulate coral of the genus Favosites for an\r\nexample, and supposing the material employed to be calcite and silica.\r\nPrecisely the same illustration would apply to a piece of wood, except\r\nthat the cell wall would be carbonaceous matter instead of carbonate\r\nof lime. In this figure the dotted parts represent carbonate of lime,\r\nthe diagonally shaded parts silica or a silicate. Thus we have in the\r\nnatural state the walls of carbonate of lime and the cavities empty\r\n(_a_). When fossilized the cavities may be merely filled with carbonate\r\nof lime, or they may be filled with silica (_b, c_); or the walls\r\nthemselves may be replaced by silica, and the cavities may remain\r\nfilled with carbonate of lime (_d_); or both the walls and cavities\r\nmay be represented by or filled with silica or silicates (_e_). The\r\nordinary specimens of Eozoon are supposed to be in the third of these\r\nstages, though some exist in the second, and I have reason to believe\r\nthat some have reached to the fifth. I have not met with any in the\r\nfourth stage, though this is not uncommon in Silurian and Devonian\r\nfossils. I have further to remark that the reason why wood and the\r\ncells of corals so readily become silicified is that the organic\r\nmatter which they contain, becoming oxidized in decay, produces carbon\r\ndioxide, which, by its affinity for alkalies, can decompose soluble\r\nsilicates and thus throw down their silica in an insoluble state. Thus\r\na fragment of decaying wood imbedded in a deposit holding water and\r\nalkaline silicates almost necessarily becomes silicified. It is also\r\nto be remarked that the ordinary specimens of Eozoon have actually not\r\nattained to the extreme degree of mineralization seen in some much more\r\nrecent silicified woods and corals, inasmuch as the portion believed to\r\nhave been the original calcareous test has not usually been silicified,\r\nbut still remains in the state of calcium carbonate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Diagram showing different States of\r\nFossilization of a cell of a Tabulate Coral, (_a_) Natural condition\r\nwalls calcite, cell empty. (_b_) Walls calcite, cell filled with the\r\nsame, (_c_) Walls calcite, cell filled with silica or silicate, (_d_)\r\nWalls silicified, cell filled with calcite. (_e_) Walls silicified,\r\ncell filled with silica or silicate.]\r\n\r\nWith regard, then, to the calcareous organisms with which we have now\r\nmore especially to do, when these are embedded in pure limestone and\r\nfilled with the same, so that the whole rock, fossils and cavities,\r\nis one in composition, and when metamorphic action has caused the\r\nwhole to become crystalline, and has perhaps removed the remains of\r\ncarbonaceous matter, it may be very difficult to detect any traces\r\nof structure. But even in this case careful management of light may\r\nreveal some indications. In many instances, however, even where the\r\nlimestones have become perfectly crystalline, and the cleavage planes\r\ncut freely across the fossils, these exhibit their forms and minute\r\nstructures in great perfection. This is the case in many of the Lower\r\nSilurian limestones of Canada, as I have elsewhere shown.[62] The grey\r\ncrystalline Trenton limestone of Montreal, used as a building stone,\r\nis an excellent illustration. To the naked eye it is a grey marble\r\ncomposed of cleavable crystals; but when examined in thin slices, it\r\nshows its organic fragments in the greatest beauty, and all their\r\nminute parts are perfectly marked out by delicate carbonaceous lines.\r\nThe only exception in this limestone is in the case of the crinoids,\r\nin which the cellular structure is filled with transparent calc-spar,\r\nperfectly identical with the original solid matter, so that they appear\r\nsolid and homogeneous, but there are examples in which even the minute\r\nmeshes of these become' apparent. The specimen represented in Fig. 14\r\nis a mass of Corals, Polyzoa, and Crinoids, and shows these under a\r\nlow power, as represented in the figure. The specimen in Fig. 15 shows\r\nthe Laurentian Eozoon in a similar state of preservation. It is from a\r\nsketch by Dr. Carpenter, and exhibits the delicate canals partly filled\r\nwith calcite or dolomite, as clear and colourless as that of the shell\r\nitself, and distinguishable only by careful management of the light.\r\n\r\n[62] _Canadian Naturalist_, 1859: \"Microscopic Structure of Canadian\r\nLimestones.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Slice of Crystalline Lower Silurian Limestone;\r\nshowing Crinoids, Bryozoa, and Corals in fragments.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Walls of Eozoon penetrated with Canals. The\r\nunshaded portions filled with Calcite. (After Carpenter.)]\r\n\r\nIn the case of recent and fossil Foraminifers, these very frequently\r\nhave their chambers filled solid with calcareous matter, and as Dr.\r\nCarpenter well remarks, even well-preserved Tertiary Nummulites in\r\nthis state often fail greatly in showing their structures, though in\r\nthe same condition they occasionally show these in great perfection.\r\nAmong the finest I have seen are specimens from the Mount of Olives,\r\nand Dr. Carpenter mentions as equally good those of the London clay at\r\nBracklesham. But in no condition do modern Foraminifera, or those of\r\nthe Tertiary and Mesozoic rocks appear in greater perfection than when\r\nfilled with the hydrous silicate of iron and potash called glauconite\r\nor green earth, a substance now forming in some parts of the ocean, and\r\nwhich gives, by the abundance of its little bottle-green concretions\r\nthe name of \"greensand\" to formations of the Cretaceous age both in\r\nEurope and America. In some beds of greensand every grain seems,\r\nto have been moulded into the interior of a microscopic shell, and\r\nhas retained its form after the frail envelope has been removed. In\r\nsome cases the glauconite has not only filled the chambers but has\r\npenetrated the fine tubulation, and when the shell is removed, either\r\nnaturally or by the action of an acid, the silicious fillings of the\r\ninterior of the tubes project in minute needles or bundles of threads\r\nof marvellous delicacy from the surface of the cast. It is in the\r\nwarmer seas, and especially in the bed of the Egean and of the Gulf\r\nStream, that such specimens are now most usually found.[63] If we ask\r\nwhy this mineral glauconite should be associated with foraminiferal\r\nshells, the answer is that they are both products of one kind of\r\nlocality. The same sea bottoms in which Foraminifera most abound are\r\nalso those in which the chemical conditions for the formation of\r\nglauconite exist. Hence, no doubt, the association of this mineral\r\nwith the great foraminiferal formation of the chalk. It is indeed by\r\nno means unlikely that the selection by these creatures of the pure\r\ncarbonate of lime from the sea water or its minute plants, may be\r\nthe means of setting free the silica, iron, and potash, in a state\r\nsuitable for their combination. Similar silicates are found associated\r\nwith marine limestones, as far back as the Cambro-Silurian age;\r\nand Dr. Sterry Hunt, than whom no one can be a better authority on\r\nchemical geology, has argued on chemical grounds that the occurrence\r\nof serpentine with the remains of Eozoon is an association of the same\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n[63] Beautiful specimens of Nummulites preserved in this way, from the\r\nEocene of Kumpfen in Bavaria, have been communicated to me through the\r\nkindness of Dr. Otto Hahn.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the infiltration of the pores of Eozoon with\r\nserpentine and other silicates has evidently been one main means of its\r\npreservation. When so infiltrated no metamorphism short of the complete\r\nfusion of the containing rock could obliterate the minutest points\r\nof structure; and that such fusion has not occurred, the preservation\r\nin the Laurentian rocks of the most delicate lamination of the beds\r\nshows conclusively; while, as already stated, it can be shown that the\r\nalteration which has occurred might have taken place at a temperature\r\nfar short of that necessary to fuse limestone. Thus has it happened\r\nthat these most ancient fossils have been handed down to our time in a\r\nstate of preservation comparable, as Dr. Carpenter states, to that of\r\nthe best preserved fossil Foraminifera from the more recent formations\r\nthat have come under his observation in the course of all his long\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nLet us now look more minutely at the nature of the typical specimens\r\nof Eozoon as originally observed and described, and then turn to those\r\npreserved in other ways, or more or less destroyed or defaced. Taking\r\na polished specimen from Petite Nation, we find the shell represented\r\nby white limestone, and the chambers by light green serpentine. By\r\nacting on the surface with a dilute acid we etch out the calcareous\r\npart, leaving a cast in serpentine of the cavities originally occupied\r\nby the soft animal substance, and when this is done in polished slices,\r\nthese may be made to print their own characters on paper, as has\r\nactually been done in the plate prefixed, which is an electrotype from\r\nan etched specimen, and shows both the laminated and acervuline parts\r\nof the fossil. If the process of decalcification has been carefully\r\nexecuted, we find in the excavated spaces delicate ramifying processes\r\nof opaque serpentine or transparent dolomite, which were originally\r\nimbedded in the calcareous substance, and which are often of extreme\r\nfineness and complexity.[64] (Figs. 18, 19.) These are casts of the\r\ncanals which traversed the shell when still inhabited by the animal,\r\nand have subsequently been filled with mineral matter. In evidence\r\nof this we sometimes find in a single canal an outer tubular layer\r\nof serpentine and an inner filling of dolomite, just as vessels of\r\nfossil plants are sometimes filled with successive coats of different\r\nmaterials. In some well preserved specimens we find the original cell\r\nwall represented by a delicate white film, which under the microscope\r\nshows minute needle-like parallel processes representing its still\r\nfiner tubuli. It is evident that to have filled these tubuli, the\r\nserpentine must have been introduced in a state of actual solution,\r\nand must have carried with it no foreign impurities. Consequently\r\nwe find that in the chambers themselves the serpentine is pure; and\r\nif we examine it under polarized light, we see that it presents a\r\nsingularly curdled or irregularly laminated appearance, as if it had an\r\nimperfectly crystalline structure, and had been deposited in irregular\r\nlaminæ, beginning at the sides of the chambers, and filling them toward\r\nthe middle, and had afterward been cracked by shrinkage, and the cracks\r\nfilled with a second deposit of serpentine.[65] Now, serpentine is a\r\nhydrous silicate of magnesia, and all that we need to suppose is that\r\nin the waters of the Laurentian sea magnesia was present instead of\r\niron, alumina or potash, and we can understand that the Laurentian\r\nfossil has been petrified by infiltration with serpentine, as more\r\nmodern Foraminifera have been with glauconite, which, though it does\r\nnot contain magnesia, often has a considerable percentage of alumina.\r\nFurther, in specimens of Eozoon from Burgess, the filling mineral is\r\nloganite, a compound of silica, alumina, magnesia and iron with water,\r\nwhile in other specimens the filling mineral is pyroxene. In like\r\nmanner, in certain Silurian limestones from New Brunswick and Wales,\r\nin which the delicate microscopic pores of the skeletons of stalked\r\nstarfishes or crinoids have been filled with mineral deposits, so\r\nthat when decalcified these are most beautifully represented by their\r\ncasts, Dr. Hunt has proved the filling mineral to be[66] intermediate\r\nbetween serpentine and glauconite. We have, therefore, ample warrant\r\nfor adhering to his conclusion that the Laurentian serpentine was\r\ndeposited under conditions similar to those of the modern greensand.\r\nIndeed, independently of Eozoon, it is impossible that any geologist\r\nwho has studied the manner in which this mineral is associated with\r\nthe Laurentian limestones could believe it to have been formed in\r\nany other way. Nor need we be astonished at the fineness of the\r\ninfiltration by which these minute tubes, perhaps 1/10000 of an inch\r\nin diameter, are filled with mineral matter. The micro-geologist\r\nwell knows how, in more modern deposits, the finest pores of fossils\r\nare filled, and that mineral matter in solution can penetrate the\r\nsmallest openings that the microscope can detect. Wherever the fluids\r\nof the living body can penetrate, there also mineral substances can\r\nbe carried, and this natural injection, effected under great pressure\r\nand with the advantage of ample time, can surpass any of the feats of\r\nthe anatomical manipulator. Fig. 16 represents a microscopic joint of\r\na Crinoid from the Upper Silurian of New Brunswick, injected with the\r\nhydrous silicate already referred to, and Fig. 17 shows a microscopic\r\nchambered or spiral shell, from a Welsh Silurian limestone, with its\r\ncavities filled with a similar substance.\r\n\r\n[64] Very fine specimens can be produced by polishing thin slices, and\r\nthen etching them slightly with a very weak acid. (Plate prefixed.)\r\n\r\n[65] The same structures may be well seen in thin slices polished, to\r\nbe viewed as transparent objects. I may, however, explain that if these\r\nare made roughly, and heated in the process, they may often show only\r\nmineral structures and cleavage planes, whereas, if polished with great\r\ncare and slowly, and afterwards cleaned with an acid, they may show the\r\ncanals in great perfection.\r\n\r\n[66] Silicate of alumina, iron, magnesia, and potash.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Joint of a Crinoid, having its Pores injected\r\nwith a Hydrous Silicate.

Highly Magnified.]\r\n\r\nTaking the specimens preserved by serpentine as typical, we now turn\r\nto certain other and, in some respects, less characteristic specimens,\r\nwhich are nevertheless very instructive. At the Calumet some of\r\nthe masses are partly filled with serpentine and partly with white\r\npyroxene, an anhydrous silicate of lime and magnesia. The two minerals\r\ncan readily be distinguished when viewed with polarized light; and in\r\nsome slices I have seen part of a chamber or group of canals filled\r\nwith serpentine and part with pyroxene. In this case the pyroxene,\r\nor the materials which now compose it, must have been introduced by\r\ninfiltration, as well as the serpentine. This is the more remarkable as\r\npyroxene is most usually found as an ingredient of igneous rocks; but\r\nDr. Hunt has shown that in the Laurentian limestones, and also in veins\r\ntraversing them, it occurs under conditions which imply its deposition\r\nfrom water, either cold or warm. Gümbel remarks on this:--\"Hunt, in\r\na very ingenious manner, compares this formation and deposition of\r\nserpentine, pyroxene, and loganite, with that of glauconite, whose\r\nformation has gone on uninterruptedly from the Silurian to the Tertiary\r\nperiod, and is even now taking place in the depths of the sea; it being\r\nwell known that Ehrenberg and others have already shown that many of\r\nthe grains of glauconite are casts of the interior of foraminiferal\r\nshells. In the light of this comparison, the notion that the serpentine\r\nand such-like minerals of the primitive limestones have been formed,\r\nin a similar manner, in the chambers of Eozoic Foraminifera, loses any\r\ntraces of improbability which it might at first seem to possess.\"\r\n\r\nIn many parts of the skeleton of Eozoon, and even in the best\r\ninfiltrated serpentine specimens, there are portions of the cell wall\r\nand canal system which have been filled with calcareous spar or with\r\ndolomite, so similar to the skeleton that it can be detected only under\r\nthe most favourable lights and with great care (Fig. 15, _supra_). It\r\nis further to be remarked that in all the specimens of true Eozoon,\r\nas well as in many other calcareous fossils preserved in ancient\r\nrocks, the calcareous matter, even when its minute structures are not\r\npreserved, or are obscured, presents a minutely granular or curdled\r\nappearance, arising, no doubt, from the original presence of organic\r\nmatter, and not recognised in purely inorganic calcite.\r\n\r\nOther specimens of fragmental Eozoon from the Petite Nation localities\r\nhave their canals filled with dolomite, which probably penetrated them\r\nafter they were broken up and imbedded in the rock. I have ascertained,\r\nwith respect to these fragments of Eozoon, that they occur abundantly\r\nin certain layers of the Laurentian limestone, beds of some thickness\r\nbeing in great part made up of them, and coarse and fine fragments\r\noccur in alternate layers, like the broken corals in some Silurian\r\nlimestones.\r\n\r\nFinally, on this part of the subject, careful observation of many\r\nspecimens of Laurentian limestone which present no trace of Eozoon\r\nwhen viewed by the naked eye, and no evidence of structure when acted\r\non with acids, are nevertheless organic, and consist of fragments\r\nof Eozoon, and possibly of other organisms, not infiltrated with\r\nsilicates, but only with carbonate of lime, and consequently revealing\r\nonly obscure indications of their minute structure. I have satisfied\r\nmyself of this by long and patient investigations, which scarcely admit\r\nof any adequate representation, either by words or figures.\r\n\r\nEvery worker in those applications of the microscope to geological\r\nspecimens which have been termed micro-geology, is familiar with the\r\nfact that crystalline forces and mechanical movements of material often\r\nplay the most fantastic tricks with fossilized organic matter. In\r\nfossil woods, for example, we often have the tissues disorganized, with\r\nradiating crystallizations of calcite and little spherical concretions\r\nof quartz, or disseminated cubes and grains of pyrite, or little\r\nveins filled with sulphate of barium or other minerals. We need not,\r\ntherefore, be surprised to find that in the venerable rocks containing\r\nEozoon, such things occur in the highly crystalline Laurentian\r\nlimestones, and even in some still showing the traces of Eozoon. We\r\nfind many disseminated crystals of magnetite, pyrite, spinel, mica and\r\nother minerals, curiously curved prisms of vermicular mica, bundles\r\nof aciculi of tremolite and similar substances, veins of calcite\r\nand crysotile or fibrous serpentine, which often traverse the best\r\nspecimens. Where these occur abundantly, we usually find no organic\r\nstructures remaining, or if they exist, they are in a very defective\r\nstate of preservation. Even in specimens presenting the lamination\r\nof Eozoon to the naked eye, these crystalline actions have often\r\ndestroyed the minute structure; and I fear that some microscopists\r\nhave been victimized, by having under their consideration only\r\nspecimens in which the actual characters had been too much defaced to\r\nbe discernible. No mistake can be greater than to suppose that any\r\nand every specimen of Laurentian limestone must contain Eozoon. More\r\nespecially have I hitherto failed to detect traces of it in those\r\ncarbonaceous or graphitic limestones which are so very abundant in the\r\nLaurentian country. Perhaps where vegetable matter was very plentiful\r\nEozoon did not thrive, or, on the other hand, the growth of Eozoon\r\nmay have diminished the quantity of vegetable matter. It is also to\r\nbe observed that much compression and distortion have occurred in the\r\nbeds of Laurentian limestone and their contained fossils, and also\r\nthat the specimens are often broken by faults, some of which are so\r\nsmall as to appear only on microscopic examination, and to shift the\r\nplates of the fossil just as if they were beds of rock. This, though\r\nit sometimes produces puzzling appearances, is an evidence that the\r\nfossils were hard and brittle when this faulting took place, and is\r\nconsequently an additional proof of their extraneous origin. In some\r\nspecimens it would seem that the lower and older part of the fossil\r\nhad been wholly converted into serpentine or pyroxene, or had so\r\nnearly experienced this change that only small parts of the calcareous\r\nwall can be recognised. These portions correspond with fossil woods\r\naltogether silicified, not only by the filling of the cells, but\r\nalso by the conversion of the walls into silica. I have specimens\r\nwhich manifestly show the transition from the ordinary condition of\r\nfilling with serpentine to one in which the cell walls are represented\r\nobscurely by one shade of this mineral and the cavities by another. In\r\ngeneral, however, it will be gathered from the above explanations that\r\nthe specimens of Eozoon fall short in thoroughness of mineralization\r\nof some fossils in much more modern rocks. I have specimens of ancient\r\nsponges whose spicular skeletons, originally silicious, have been\r\nreplaced by pyrite or bisulphide of iron, and of Tertiary fossil woods\r\nretaining perfectly their most minute structures, yet entirely replaced\r\nby silica, so that not a particle of the original wood remains.\r\n\r\nThe above considerations as to mode of preservation of Eozoon concur\r\nwith those in the previous chapter in showing its oceanic character,\r\nif really a fossil; but the ocean of the Eozoic period may not have\r\nbeen so deep as at present, and its waters were probably warm and\r\nwell stocked with mineral matters derived from the newly formed land,\r\nor from hot springs in its own bottom. On this point the interesting\r\ninvestigations of Dr. Hunt with reference to the chemical conditions\r\nof the Silurian seas allow us to suppose that the Laurentian ocean may\r\nhave been much more richly stored, more especially with salts of lime\r\nand magnesia, than that of subsequent times. Hence the conditions of\r\nwarmth, light, and nutriment required by such gigantic Protozoans would\r\nall be present, and hence, also, no doubt, some of the peculiarities of\r\ntheir mineralization.\r\n\r\nI desire by the above statement of facts to show, on the one hand,\r\nthat the study of Eozoon, regarded as probably an ancient form of\r\nmarine life, aids us in understanding other ancient fossils, and their\r\nmanner of preservation; and on the other hand, that those who deny the\r\norganic origin of Eozoon place us in the position of being unable, in\r\nany rational manner, to account for these forms, so characteristic\r\nof the Laurentian limestones, and set at naught the fair conclusions\r\ndeducible from the mode of preservation of fossils in the later\r\nformations. The evidence of organic origin is perhaps not conclusive,\r\nand in the present state of knowledge it is certain to be met with much\r\nscepticism, more especially by certain classes of specialists, whose\r\ngrasp of knowledge is not sufficiently wide to cover, on the one hand,\r\nfossilization and metamorphism, and on the other, to understand the\r\nlower forms of life. It may, however, be sufficient to qualify us in\r\nturning our thoughts for a few moments to considerations suggested by\r\nthe probable origin of animal life in the seas of the Laurentian period.\r\n\r\nLooking down from the elevation of our physiological and mental\r\nsuperiority, it is difficult to realize the exact conditions in which\r\nlife exists in creatures so simple as the Protozoa. There may perhaps\r\nbe higher intelligences, that find it equally difficult to realize how\r\nlife and reason can manifest themselves in such poor houses of clay\r\nas those we inhabit. But placing ourselves near to these creatures,\r\nand entering, as it were, into sympathy with them, we can understand\r\nsomething of their powers and feelings. In the first place it is plain\r\nthat they can vigorously, if roughly, exercise those mechanical,\r\nchemical, and vegetative powers of life which are characteristic of\r\nthe animal. They can seize, swallow, digest, and assimilate food; and,\r\nemploying its albuminous parts in nourishing their tissues, can burn\r\naway the rest in processes akin to our respiration, or reject it from\r\ntheir system. Like us, they can subsist only on food which the plant\r\nhas previously produced; for in this world, from the beginning of time,\r\nthe plant has been the only organism which could use the solar light\r\nand heat as forces to enable it to turn the dead elements of matter\r\ninto living, growing tissues, and into organic compounds capable of\r\nnourishing the animal. Like us, the Protozoa expend the food which\r\nthey have assimilated in the production of animal force, and in doing\r\nso cause it to be oxidized, or burnt away, and resolved again into\r\ndead matter. It is true that we have much more complicated apparatus\r\nfor performing these functions, but it does not follow that these give\r\nus much real superiority, except relatively to the more difficult\r\nconditions of our existence. The gourmand who enjoys his dinner may\r\nhave no more pleasure in the act than the Amœba which swallows a\r\nDiatom; and for all that the man knows of the subsequent processes to\r\nwhich the food is subjected, his interior might be a mass of jelly,\r\nwith extemporised vacuoles, like that of his humble fellow-animal. The\r\nclay is after all the same, and there may be as much difficulty in the\r\nmaking of a simple organism with varied powers, as a more complex frame\r\nfor doing higher work.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may feel, a complicated apparatus of nerves and brain\r\ncells has to be constructed and set to work; but the Protozoon, without\r\nany distinct brain, is all brain, and its sensation is simply direct.\r\nThus vision in these creatures is probably performed in a rough way by\r\nany part of their transparent bodies, and taste and smell are no doubt\r\nin the same case. Whether they have any perception of sound as distinct\r\nfrom the mere vibrations ascertained by touch, we do not know. Here,\r\nalso, we are not far removed above the Protozoa, especially those of us\r\nto whom touch, seeing and hearing are direct acts, without any thought\r\nor knowledge of the apparatus employed. We might, so far, as well be\r\nAmœbas. As we rise higher we meet with more differences. Yet it is\r\nevident that our gelatinous fellow being can feel pain, dread danger,\r\ndesire possessions, enjoy pleasure, and in a direct unconscious way\r\nentertain many of the appetites and passions that affect ourselves.\r\nThe wonder is that with so little of organization it can do so much.\r\nYet, perhaps, life can manifest itself in a broader and more intense\r\nway where there is little organization, and a highly strung and complex\r\norganism is not so much a necessary condition of a higher life as a\r\nmere means of better adapting it to its present surroundings.\r\n\r\nA similar lesson is taught by the complexity of their skeletons. We\r\nspeak in a crude, unscientific way of these animals accumulating\r\ncalcareous matter, and building up reefs of limestone. We must,\r\nhowever, bear in mind that they are as dependent on their food for the\r\nmaterials of their skeletons as we are, and that their crusts grow in\r\nthe interior of the sarcode just as our bones do within our bodies. The\r\nprovision even for nourishing the interior of the skeleton by tubuli\r\nand canals is in principle similar to that involved in the canals,\r\ncells, and canalicules of bone. The Amœba, of course, knows neither\r\nmore nor less of this than the average Englishman. It is altogether\r\na matter of unconscious growth. The process in the Protozoa strikes\r\nsome minds, however, as the more wonderful of the two. It is, says\r\nan eminent modern physiologist, a matter of \"profound significance\"\r\nthat this \"particle of jelly [the sarcode of a Foraminifer] is capable\r\nof guiding physical forces in such a manner as to give rise to these\r\nexquisite and almost mathematically arranged structures.\" Respecting\r\nthe structures themselves there is no exaggeration in this. No arch\r\nor dome framed by human skill is more perfect in beauty or in the\r\nrealization of mechanical ideas than the tests of some Foraminifera,\r\nand none is so complete and wonderful in its internal structure. The\r\nparticle of jelly, however, is a figure of speech. The body of the\r\nhumblest Foraminifer is much more than this. It is an organism with\r\ndivers parts, and it is endowed with the mysterious forces of life\r\nwhich in it guide the physical forces, just as they do in building up\r\nphosphate of lime in our bones, or indeed, just as the will of the\r\narchitect does in building a palace. The profound significance which\r\nthis has, reaches beyond the domain of the physical and vital, even\r\nto the spiritual. It clings to all our conceptions of living things:\r\n\"quite as much, for example, to the evolution of an animal with all its\r\nparts from a one-celled germ, as to the connection of brain cells with\r\nthe manifestations of intelligence.\" Viewed in this way, we may share\r\nwith the author of the sentence I have quoted his feeling of veneration\r\nin the presence of this great wonder of animal life, \"burning, and not\r\nconsumed,\" nay, building up, and that in many and beautiful forms. We\r\nmay realize it most of all in the presence of the organism which was\r\nperhaps the first to manifest on our planet these marvellous powers.\r\nWe must, however, here also, beware of that credulity which makes too\r\nmany thinkers limit their conceptions altogether to physical force in\r\nmatters of this kind The merely materialistic physiologist is really in\r\nno better position than the savage who quails before the thunderstorm,\r\nor rejoices in the solar warmth, and seeing no force or power beyond,\r\nfancies himself in the immediate presence of his God. In Eozoon we\r\nmust discern not only a mass of jelly but a being endowed with that\r\nhigher vital force which surpasses vegetable life, and also physical\r\nand chemical forces; and in this animal energy we must see an emanation\r\nfrom a Will higher than our own, ruling vitality itself; and this not\r\nmerely to the end of constructing the skeleton of a Protozoon, but\r\nof elaborating all the wonderful developments of life that were to\r\nfollow in succeeding ages, and with reference to which the production\r\nand growth of this creature were initial steps. It is this mystery of\r\ndesign which really constitutes the \"profound significance\" of the\r\nforaminiferal skeleton.\r\n\r\nAnother phenomenon of animality forced upon our notice by the Protozoa\r\nis that of the conditions of life in animals not individual, as we\r\nare, but aggregative and cumulative in indefinite masses. What, for\r\ninstance, the relations to each other of the Polyps, growing together\r\nin a coral mass, or the separate parts of a Sponge, or the separate\r\nlobes of a Foraminifer. In the case of the Polyps we may believe that\r\nthere is special sensation in the tentacles and oral opening of each\r\nindividual, and that each may experience hunger when in want, or\r\nsatisfaction when it is filled with food, and that injuries to one part\r\nof the mass may indirectly affect other parts, but that the nutrition\r\nof the whole mass may be as much unfelt by the individual Polyps as\r\nthe processes going on in our own liver are by us. So in the case of a\r\nlarge Sponge, or Foraminifer, there may be some special sensation in\r\nindividual cells, pseudopods, or segments, and the general sensation\r\nmay be very limited, while unconscious living powers pervade the\r\nwhole. In this matter of aggregation of animals we have thus various\r\ngrades. The Foraminifers and Sponges present us with the simplest of\r\nall, and that which most resembles the aggregation of buds in the\r\nplant. The Polyps and complex Bryozoons present a higher and more\r\nspecialized type; and though the bilateral symmetry which obtains in\r\nthe higher animals is of a different nature, it still at least reminds\r\nus of that multiplication of similar parts which we see in the lower\r\ngrades of being. It is worthy of notice here that the lower animals\r\nwhich show aggregative tendencies present but imperfect indications, or\r\nnone at all, of bilateral symmetry. Their bodies, like those of plants,\r\nare for the most part built up around a central axis, or they show\r\ntendencies to spiral modes of growth.\r\n\r\nIt is this composite sort of life which is connected with the main\r\ngeological function of the Foraminifer. While active sensation,\r\nappetite, and enjoyment pervade the pseudopods and external sarcode\r\nof the mass, the hard skeleton common to the whole is growing within;\r\nand in this way the calcareous matter is gradually removed from\r\nthe sea water, and built up in solid reefs, or in piles of loose\r\nforaminiferal shells. Thus it is the aggregative or common life,\r\nalike in Foraminifers as in Corals, that tends most powerfully to the\r\naccumulation of calcareous matter; and those creatures whose life is\r\nof this complex character are best suited to be world builders, since\r\nthe result of their growth is not merely a cemetery of their osseous\r\nremains, but a huge communistic edifice, to which multitudes of lives\r\nhave contributed, and in which successive generations take up their\r\nabode on the remains of their ancestors. This process, so potent in the\r\nprogress of the earth's geological history, began, as far as we know,\r\nwith Eozoon.\r\n\r\nWhether, then, in questioning our proto-foraminifer, we have reference\r\nto the vital functions of its gelatinous sarcode, to the complexity\r\nand beauty of its calcareous test, or to its capacity for effecting\r\ngreat material results through the union of individuals, we perceive\r\nthat we have to do, not with a low condition of those powers which we\r\ndesignate life, but with their manifestation through the means of a\r\nsimple organism; and this in a degree of perfection which we, from our\r\npoint of view, would have in the first instance supposed impossible.\r\n\r\nIf we imagine a world altogether destitute of life, we still might\r\nhave geological formations in progress. Not only would volcanoes belch\r\nforth their liquid lavas and their stones and ashes, but the waves and\r\ncurrents of the ocean and the rains and streams on the land, with the\r\nceaseless decomposing action of the carbonic acid of the atmosphere,\r\nwould be piling up mud, sand, and pebbles in the sea. There might even\r\nbe some formation of limestone taking place where springs charged\r\nwith bicarbonate of lime were oozing out on the land or the bottom of\r\nthe waters. But in such a world all the carbon would be in the state\r\nof carbon dioxide, and all the limestone would either be diffused in\r\nsmall quantities through various rocks or in limited local beds, or\r\nin solution, perhaps as chloride of calcium, in the sea. Dr. Hunt has\r\ngiven chemical grounds for supposing that the most ancient seas were\r\nlargely supplied with this very soluble salt, instead of the chloride\r\nof sodium, or common salt, which now prevails in the sea water.\r\n\r\nWhere in such a world would life be introduced? on the land or in the\r\nwaters? All scientific probability would say in the latter.[67] The\r\nocean is now vastly more populous than the land. The waters alone\r\nafford the conditions necessary at once for the most minute and the\r\ngrandest organisms, at once for the simplest and for others of the most\r\ncomplex character. Especially do they afford the best conditions for\r\nthose animals which subsist in complex communities, and which aggregate\r\nlarge quantities of mineral matter in their skeletons. So true is this\r\nthat up to the present time all the species of Protozoa and of the\r\nanimals most nearly allied to them are aquatic. Even in the waters,\r\nhowever, plant life, though possibly in very simple forms, must precede\r\nthe animal.\r\n\r\n[67] A recent writer (Simroth) has, however, undertaken to maintain the\r\nthesis that land life preceded that in the sea. It is unnecessary to\r\nsay that he is an evolutionist, influenced by the necessity laid upon\r\nthat philosophy to deduce whales, seals, etc., from land animals.\r\n\r\nLet humble plants, then, be introduced in the waters, and they would\r\nat once begin to use the solar light for the purpose of decomposing\r\ncarbonic acid, and forming carbon compounds which had not before\r\nexisted, and which, independently of vegetable life, would never have\r\nexisted. At the same time lime and other mineral substances present in\r\nthe sea water would be fixed in the tissues of these plants, either\r\nin a minute state of division, as little grains or Coccoliths, or in\r\nmore solid masses like those of the Corallines and Nullipores. In this\r\nway a beginning of limestone formation might be made, and quantities\r\nof carbonaceous and bituminous matter, resulting from the decay of\r\nvegetable substances might accumulate on the sea bottom. Now arises\r\nthe opportunity for animal life. The plants have collected stores\r\nof organic matter, and their minute germs, along with microscopic\r\nspecies, are floating everywhere in the sea. The plant has fulfilled\r\nits function as far as the waters are concerned, and now a place is\r\nprepared for the animal. In what form shall it appear? Many of its\r\nhigher forms, those which depend upon animal food or on the more\r\ncomplex plants for subsistence, would obviously be unsuitable. Further,\r\nthe sea water is still too much saturated with saline matter to be\r\nfit for the higher animals of the waters. Still further, there may\r\nbe a residue of internal heat forbidding coolness, and that solution\r\nof free oxygen which is an essential condition of existence to the\r\nhigher forms of life. Something must be found suitable for this saline,\r\nimperfectly oxygenated, tepid sea. Something, too, is wanted that can\r\naid in introducing conditions more favourable to higher life in the\r\nfuture. Our experience of the modern world shows us that all these\r\nconditions can be better fulfilled by the Protozoa than by any other\r\ncreatures. They can live now equally in those great depths of ocean\r\nwhere the conditions are most unfavourable to other forms of life,\r\nand in tepid unhealthy pools overstocked with vegetable matter in a\r\nstate of putridity. They form a most suitable basis for higher forms\r\nof life. They have remarkable powers of removing mineral matters from\r\nthe waters and of fixing them in solid forms. So, in the fitness of\r\nthings, a gigantic Foraminifer is just what we need, and after it has\r\nspread itself over the mud and rock of the primeval seas, and built up\r\nextensive reefs therein, other animals may be introduced, capable of\r\nfeeding on it, or of sheltering themselves in its stony masses, and\r\nthus we have the appropriate dawn of animal life.\r\n\r\nBut what are we to say of the cause of this new series of facts, so\r\nwonderfully superimposed upon the merely vegetable and mineral? Must\r\nit remain to us as an act of creation, or was it derived from some\r\npre-existing matter in which it had been potentially present? Science\r\nfails to inform us, but conjectural \"phylogeny\" steps in and takes its\r\nplace. Haeckel, the prophet of this new philosophy, waves his magic\r\nwand, and simple masses of sarcode spring from inorganic matter, and\r\nform diffused sheets of sea slime, from which are in time separated\r\ndistinct amœboid and foraminiferal forms. Experience, however, gives us\r\nno facts whereon to build this supposition, and it remains neither more\r\nnor less scientific or certain than that old fancy of the Egyptians,\r\nwhich derived animals from the fertile mud of the Nile.\r\n\r\nIf we fail to learn anything of the origin of Eozoon, and if its life\r\nprocesses are just as inscrutable as those of higher creatures, we\r\ncan at least enquire as to its history in geological time. In this\r\nrespect we find, in the first place, that the Protozoa have not had a\r\nmonopoly in their profession of accumulators of calcareous rock.\r\n\r\nOriginated by Eozoon in the old Laurentian time, this process has\r\nbeen proceeding throughout the geological ages; and while Protozoa,\r\nequally simple with the great prototype of the race, have been and\r\nare continuing its function, and producing new limestones in every\r\ngeological period, and so adding to the volume of the successive\r\nformations, new workers of higher grades have been introduced, capable\r\nof enjoying higher forms of animal activity, and equally of labouring\r\nat the great task of continent building; of existing, too, in seas\r\nless rich in mineral substances than those of the Eozoic time, and for\r\nthat very reason better suited to higher and more skilled artists. It\r\nis to be observed in connection with this, that as the work of the\r\nForaminifers has thus been assumed by others, their size and importance\r\nhave diminished, and the larger forms of more recent times have some of\r\nthem been fain to build up their hard parts of cemented sand instead of\r\nlimestone.\r\n\r\nWhen the marvellous results of recent deep-sea dredgings were first\r\nmade known, and it was found that chalky foraminiferal earth is yet\r\naccumulating in the Atlantic, with sponges and sea urchins, resembling\r\nin many respects those whose remains exist in the chalk, the fact was\r\nexpressed by the statement that we still live in the chalk period.\r\nThus stated the conclusion is scarcely correct. We do not live in the\r\nchalk period, but the conditions of the chalk period still exist in the\r\ndeeper portions of the sea. We may say more than this. To some extent\r\nthe conditions of the Laurentian period still exist in the sea, except\r\nin so far as they have been removed by the action of the Foraminifera\r\nand other limestone builders. To those who can realize the enormous\r\nlapse of time involved in the geological history of the earth, this\r\nconveys an impression almost of eternity in the existence of this\r\noldest of all the families of the animal kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe are still more deeply impressed with this when we bring into view\r\nthe great physical changes which have occurred since the dawn of life.\r\nWhen we consider that the skeletons of Eozoon contribute to form the\r\noldest hills of our continents; that they have been sealed up in solid\r\nmarble, and that they are associated with hard crystalline rocks\r\ncontorted in the most fantastic manner; that these rocks have almost\r\nfrom the beginning of geological time been undergoing waste to supply\r\nthe material of new formations; that they have witnessed innumerable\r\nsubsidences and elevations of the continents; and that the greatest\r\nmountain chains of the earth have been built up from the sea since\r\nEozoon began to exist,--we acquire a most profound impression of the\r\npersistence of the lower forms of animal life, and know that mountains\r\nmay be removed and continents swept away and replaced, before the least\r\nof the humble gelatinous Protozoa can finally perish. Life may be a\r\nfleeting thing in the individual, but as handed down through successive\r\ngenerations of beings, and as a constant animating power in successive\r\norganisms, it appears, like its Creator, eternal.\r\n\r\nThis leads to another and very serious question. How long did lineal\r\ndescendants of Eozoon exist, and do they still exist? We may for the\r\npresent consider this question apart from ideas of derivation and\r\nelevation into higher planes of existence. Eozoon as a species, and\r\neven as a genus, may cease to exist with the Eozoic age, and we have\r\nno evidence whatever that any succeeding creatures are its modified\r\ndescendants. As far as their structures inform us, they may as much\r\nclaim to be original creations as Eozoon itself. Still descendants of\r\nEozoon may have continued to exist, though we have not yet met with\r\nthem. I should not be surprised to hear of a veritable specimen being\r\nsome day dredged alive in the Atlantic or the Pacific. It is also\r\nto be observed that in animals so simple as this many varieties may\r\nappear, widely different from the original. In these the general form\r\nand habit of life are the most likely things to change, the minute\r\nstructures much less so. We need not, therefore, be surprised to find\r\nits descendants diminishing in size or altering in general form, while\r\nthe characters of the fine tubulation and of the canal system would\r\nremain. We need not wonder if any sessile Foraminifer of the Nummuline\r\ngroup should prove to be a descendant of Eozoon. It would be less\r\nlikely that a Sponge or a Foraminifer of the Rotaline type should\r\noriginate from it. If one could only secure a succession of deep-sea\r\nlimestones with Foraminifers extending all the way from the Laurentian\r\nto the present time, I can imagine nothing more interesting than to\r\ncompare the whole series, with the view of ascertaining the limits of\r\ndescent with variation, and the points where new forms are introduced.\r\nWe have not yet such a series, but it may be obtained; and as these\r\ncreatures are eminently cosmopolitan, occurring over vastly wide areas\r\nof sea bottom, and are very variable, they would afford a better test\r\nof theories of derivation than any that can be obtained from the more\r\nlocally distributed and less variable animals of higher grade. I was\r\nmuch struck with this recently, in examining a series of Foraminifera\r\nfrom the Cretaceous of Manitoba, and comparing them with the varietal\r\nforms of the same species in the interior of Nebraska, 500 miles to the\r\nsouth, and with those of the English chalk and of the modern seas. In\r\nall these different times and places we had the same species. In all\r\nthey existed under so many varietal forms passing into each other, that\r\nin former times every species had been multiplied by naturalists into\r\nseveral. Yet, in all, the identical varietal forms were repeated with\r\nthe most minute markings the same. Here were at once constancy the most\r\nremarkable, and variations the most extensive. If we dwell on the one\r\nto the exclusion of the other, we reach only one-sided conclusions,\r\nimperfect and unsatisfactory. By taking both into connection we can\r\nalone realize the full significance of the facts. We cannot yet obtain\r\nsuch series for all geological time; but it may even now be worth while\r\nto enquire, What do we know as to any modification in the case of the\r\nprimeval Foraminifers, whether with reference to the derivation from\r\nthem of other Protozoa or of higher forms of life?\r\n\r\nThere is no link in geological fact to connect Eozoon with any of the\r\nMollusks, Radiates, or Crustaceans of the succeeding Cambrian. What\r\nmay be discovered in the future we cannot conjecture; but at present\r\nthese stand before us as distinct creations. It would of course be more\r\nprobable that Eozoon should be the ancestor of some of the Foraminifera\r\nof the Primordial age, but strangely enough it is very dissimilar\r\nfrom all these, except Cryptozoum and some forms of Stromatopora; and\r\nhere, as already stated, the evidence of minute structure fails to\r\na great extent. Of actual facts, therefore, we have none; and those\r\nevolutionists who have regarded the dawn animal as an evidence in their\r\nfavour have been obliged to have recourse to supposition and assumption.\r\n\r\nWe may imagine Eozoon itself, however, to state its experience as\r\nfollows:--\"I, Eozoon Canadense, being a creature of low organization\r\nand intelligence, and of practical turn, am no theorist, but have a\r\nlively appreciation of such facts as I am able to perceive. I found\r\nmyself growing upon the sea bottom, and know not whence I came. I grew\r\nand flourished for ages, and found no let or hindrance to my expansion,\r\nand abundance of food was always floated to me without my having to go\r\nin search of it. At length a change came. Certain creatures with hard\r\nsnouts and jaws began to prey on me. Whence they came I know not; I\r\ncannot think that they came from the germs which I had dispersed so\r\nabundantly throughout the ocean. Unfortunately, just at the same time\r\nlime became a little less abundant in the waters, perhaps because of\r\nthe great demands I myself had made, and thus it was not so easy as\r\nbefore to produce a thick supplemental skeleton for defence. So I had\r\nto give way. I have done my best to avoid extinction; but it is clear\r\nthat I must at length be overcome, and must either disappear or subside\r\ninto a humbler condition, and that other creatures better provided for\r\nthe new conditions of the world must take my place.\" In such terms we\r\nmay suppose that this patriarch of the seas might tell his history, and\r\nmourn his destiny, though he might also congratulate himself on having\r\nin an honest way done his duty and fulfilled his function in the world,\r\nleaving it to other and perhaps wiser creatures to dispute as to his\r\norigin and fate, while perhaps much less perfectly fulfilling the ends\r\nof their own existence.\r\n\r\nThus our dawn animal has positively no story to tell as to its own\r\nintroduction or its transmutation into other forms of existence.\r\nIt leaves the mystery of creation where it was, but in connection\r\nwith the subsequent history of life we can learn from it a little\r\nas to the laws which have governed the succession of animals in\r\ngeological time. First, we may learn that the plan of creation has\r\nbeen progressive, that there has been an advance from the few low and\r\ngeneralized types of the primæval ocean to the more numerous, higher,\r\nand more specialized types of more recent times. Secondly, we learn\r\nthat the lower types, when first introduced, and before they were\r\nsubordinated to higher forms of life, existed in some of their grandest\r\nmodifications as to form and complexity, and that in succeeding ages,\r\nwhen higher types were replacing them, they were subjected to decay and\r\ndegeneracy. Thirdly, we learn that while the species has a limited term\r\nof existence in geological time, any large type of animal existence,\r\nlike that of the Foraminifera or Sponges, for example, once introduced,\r\ncontinues and finds throughout all the vicissitudes of the earth some\r\nappropriate residence. Fourthly, as to the mode of introduction of new\r\ntypes, or whether such creatures as Eozoon had any direct connection\r\nwith the subsequent introduction of Mollusks, Worms, or Crustaceans, it\r\nis altogether silent, nor can it predict anything as to the order or\r\nmanner of their introduction.\r\n\r\nHad we been permitted to visit the Laurentian seas, and to study Eozoon\r\nand its contemporary Protozoa when alive, it is plain that we could not\r\nhave foreseen or predicted from the consideration of such organisms\r\nthe future development of life. No amount of study of the prototypal\r\nForaminifer could have led us distinctly to the conception of even a\r\nSponge or a Polyp, much less of any of the higher animals. Why is this?\r\nThe answer is that the improvement into such higher types does not\r\ntake place by any change of the elementary sarcode, either in those\r\nchemical, mechanical, or vital properties which we can study, but in\r\nthe adding to it of new structures. In the Sponge, which is perhaps\r\nthe nearest type of all, we have the movable pulsating cilium and true\r\nanimal cellular tissue, and along with this the spicular or fibrous\r\nskeleton, these structures leading to an entire change in the mode of\r\nlife and subsistence. In the higher types of animals it is the same.\r\nEven in the highest we have white blood corpuscles and germinal matter,\r\nwhich, in so far as we know, carry on no higher forms of life than\r\nthose of an Amœba; but they are now made subordinate to other kinds\r\nof tissues, of great variety and complexity, which never have been\r\nobserved to arise out of the growth of any Protozoon. There would be\r\nonly a few conceivable inferences which the highest finite intelligence\r\ncould deduce as to the development of future and higher animals. He\r\nmight infer that the Foraminiferal sarcode, once introduced, might be\r\nthe substratum or foundation of other but unknown tissues in the higher\r\nanimals, and that the Protozoon type might continue to subsist side\r\nby side with higher forms of living things, as they were successively\r\nintroduced. He might also infer that the elevation of the animal\r\nkingdom would take place with reference to those new properties of\r\nsensation and voluntary motion in which the humblest animals diverge\r\nfrom the life of the plant.\r\n\r\nIt is important that these points should be clearly before our minds,\r\nbecause there has been current of late among naturalists a loose way\r\nof writing with reference to them, which seems to have imposed on many\r\nwho are not naturalists. It has been said, for example, that such an\r\norganism as Eozoon may include potentially all the structures and\r\nfunctions of the higher animals, and that it is possible that we might\r\nbe able to infer or calculate all these with as much certainty as we\r\ncan calculate an eclipse or any other physical phenomenon. Now, there\r\nis not only no foundation in fact for these assertions, but it is, from\r\nour present standpoint, not conceivable that they can ever be realized.\r\nThe laws of inorganic matter give no data whence any _à priori_\r\ndeductions or calculations could be made as to the structure and\r\nvital forces of the plant. The plant gives no data from which we can\r\ncalculate the functions of the animal. The Protozoon gives no data from\r\nwhich we can calculate the specialties of the Mollusk, the Articulate,\r\nor the Vertebrate. Nor, unhappily, do the present conditions of life of\r\nthemselves give us any sure grounds for predicting the new creations\r\nthat may be in store for our old planet. Those who think to build a\r\nphilosophy and even a religion on such data are mere dreamers, and have\r\nno scientific basis for their dogmas. They are as blind guides as our\r\nprimæval Protozoon himself would be in matters whose real solution lies\r\nin the harmony of our own higher and immaterial nature with the Being\r\nwho is the Author of all life--the Father \"from whom every family in\r\nheaven and earth is named.\"\r\n\r\n  References:--\"Life's Dawn on Earth.\" London, 1885.

Geology\r\nfirst removed this pleasant state of repose, by showing that all our\r\npresent species had a beginning, and were preceded by others, and these\r\nagain by others. Geologists were, however, too much occupied with the\r\nfacts of the succession to speculate on the ultimate causes of the\r\nappearance and disappearance of species, and it remained for zoologists\r\nand botanists, or as some prefer to call themselves, biologists, to\r\nconstruct hypotheses or theories to account for the ascertained fact\r\nthat successive dynasties of species have succeeded each other in\r\ntime. I do not propose in this paper so much to deal with the various\r\ndoctrines as to derivation and development now current, as to ask the\r\nquestion, What do we actually know as to the origin and history of life\r\non our planet?\r\n\r\nThis great question, confessedly accompanied with many difficulties and\r\nstill waiting for its full solution, has points of intense interest\r\nboth for the Geologist and the Biologist. \"If,\" says the great\r\nfounder of the uniformitarian School of Geology, \"the past duration\r\nof the earth be finite, then the aggregate of geological epochs,\r\nhowever numerous, must constitute a mere moment of the past, a mere\r\ninfinitesimal portion of eternity.\" Yet to our limited vision, the\r\norigin of life fades away in the almost illimitable depths of past\r\ntime, and we are ready to despair of ever reaching, by any process of\r\ndiscovery, to its first steps of progress. At what time did life begin?\r\nIn what form did dead matter first assume or receive those mysterious\r\nfunctions of growth, reproduction and sensation? Only when we picture\r\nto ourselves an absolutely lifeless world, destitute of any germ of\r\nlife or organization, can we realize the magnitude of these questions,\r\nand perceive how necessary it is to limit their scope if we would hope\r\nfor any satisfactory answer.\r\n\r\nWe may here dismiss altogether that form in which these questions\r\npresent themselves to the biologist, when he experiments as to the\r\nevolution of living forms from dead liquids or solids attacking the\r\nunsolved problem of spontaneous generation. Nor need we enter on the\r\nvast field of discussion as to modern animals and plants opened up by\r\nDarwin and others. I shall confine myself altogether to that historical\r\nor palæontological aspect in which life presents itself when we study\r\nthe fossil remains entombed in the sediments of the earth's crust, and\r\nwhich will enable me at least to show why some students of fossils\r\nhesitate to give in their adhesion to any of the current notions as to\r\nthe origin of species. It will also be desirable to avoid, as far as\r\npossible, the use of the term \"evolution,\" as this has recently been\r\nemployed in so many senses, whether of development or causation, as to\r\nhave become nearly useless for any scientific purpose; and that when I\r\nspeak of creation of species, the term is to be understood not in the\r\narbitrary sense forced on it by some modern writers, but as indicating\r\nthe continuous introduction of new forms of life under definite laws,\r\nbut by a power not emanating from within themselves, nor from the\r\ninanimate nature surrounding them.[68]\r\n\r\n[68] The terms Derivation, Development and Causation have clear and\r\ndefinite meanings, and it is preferable, wherever possible, to use one\r\nor other of these.\r\n\r\nIf we were to follow the guidance of those curious analogies which\r\npresent themselves when we consider the growth of the individual\r\nplant or animal from the spore or the ovum, and the development of\r\nvegetable and animal life in geological time--analogies which, however,\r\nit must be borne in mind can have no scientific value whatever,\r\ninasmuch as that similarity of conditions which alone can give force\r\nto reasoning from analogy in matters of science, is wholly wanting--we\r\nshould expect to find in the oldest rocks embryonic forms alone, but\r\nof course embryonic forms suited to exist and reproduce themselves\r\nindependently.[69]\r\n\r\n[69] I may be pardoned for taking an example of the confusion of\r\nthought which this mode of reasoning has introduced into Biology\r\nfrom a clever article in the _Contemporary_ written by a very able\r\nand much-esteemed biologist. He says: \"The morphological distance\r\nbetween a newly hatched frog's tadpole and the adult frog is almost\r\nas great as that between the adult lancelet and the newly hatched\r\nlarvæ of the lamprey.\" The \"morphological distance\" truly, but what\r\nof the physiological distance between the young and adult of the same\r\nanimal and two adult animals between which is placed the great gulf of\r\nspecific and generic diversity which within human experience neither\r\nhas been known to pass?\r\n\r\nI need not say to palæontologists that this is not what we actually\r\nfind in the primordial rocks. I need but to remind them of the early\r\nand remarkable development of such forms as the Trilobites, the\r\nLingulidæ and the Pteropods, all of them highly complex and specialized\r\ntypes, and remote from the embryonic stages of the groups to which\r\nthey severally belong. In the case of the Trilobites, one need merely\r\nconsider the beautiful symmetry of their parts, both transversely and\r\nlongitudinally, their division into distinct regions, the necessary\r\ncomplexity of their muscular and nervous systems, their highly complex\r\nvisual organs, the superficial ornamentation and microscopic structure\r\nof their crusts, their advanced position among Crustaceans, indicated\r\nby their strong affinity with the Arachnidans or spiders and scorpions.\r\n(See figures prefixed.)\r\n\r\nAll these characters give them an aspect far from embryonic, while, as\r\nBarrande has pointed out, this advanced position of the group has its\r\nsignificance greatly strengthened by the fact that in early primordial\r\ntimes we have to deal not with one species, but with a vast and highly\r\ndifferentiated group, embracing forms of many and varied subordinate\r\ntypes. As we shall see, these and other early animals may be regarded\r\nas of generalized types, but not as embryonic. Here, then, meets us at\r\nthe outset the fact that in as far as the great groups of annulose and\r\nmolluscous animals are concerned, we can trace these back no farther\r\nthan to a period in which they appear already highly advanced, much\r\nspecialized and represented by many diverse forms. Either, therefore,\r\nthese great groups came in on this high initial plane, or we have\r\nscarcely reached half way back in the life-history of our planet.\r\n\r\nWe have, here, however, by this one consideration, attained at once to\r\ntwo great and dominant laws regulating the history of life. First, the\r\nlaw of continuity, whereby new forms come in successively, throughout\r\ngeological time, though, as we shall see, with periods of greater or\r\nless frequency. Secondly, the law of specialization of types, whereby\r\ngeneralized forms are succeeded by those more special, and this\r\nprobably connected with the growing specialization of the inorganic\r\nworld. It is this second law which causes the parallelism between the\r\nhistory of successive species and that of the embryo.\r\n\r\nWe have already considered the claims which Eozoon and its\r\ncontemporaries may urge to recognition, as beginnings of life; but\r\nwhen we ascend from the Laurentian beds, we find ourselves in a barren\r\nseries of conglomerates, sandstones, and other rocks, indicating shore\r\nrather than sea conditions, and remarkably destitute of indications of\r\nlife. These are the Huronian beds, and possibly other series associated\r\nwith them. They have afforded spicules of sponges, casts of burrows\r\nof worms, obscure forms, which may represent crustaceans or mollusks,\r\nmarkings of unknown origin, and some laminated forms which may perhaps\r\nrepresent remains of Eozoon, though their structures are imperfectly\r\npreserved. These are sufficient to show that marine life continued in\r\nsome forms, and to encourage the hope that a rich pre-Cambrian fauna\r\nmay yet be discovered.\r\n\r\nBut let us leave for the present the somewhat isolated case of Eozoon,\r\nand the few scattered forms of the Huronian, and go on farther to\r\nthe early Cambrian fauna. This is graphically presented to us in\r\nthe sections in South Wales, as described by Hicks. Here we find a\r\nnucleus of ancient rocks, supposed to be Laurentian, though in mineral\r\ncharacter more nearly akin to the Huronian, but which have hitherto\r\nafforded no trace of fossils. Resting unconformably on these is a\r\nseries of slates and sandstones, regarded as Lower Cambrian, the\r\nCaerfai group of Hicks, and which are the earliest holding organic\r\nremains. The lowest bed which contains indications of life is a red\r\nshale near the base of the series, which holds a few organic remains.\r\nThe species are a _Lingulella_, worm burrows and a Trilobite.[70]\r\nSupposing these to be all, it is remarkable that we have no Protozoa\r\nor Corals or Echinoderms, and that the types of Brachiopods and\r\nCrustaceans are of comparatively modern affinities. Passing upward\r\nthrough 1,000 feet of barren sandstone and shale, we reach a zone in\r\nwhich many Trilobites of at least five genera are found, along with\r\nPteropods, Brachiopods and Sponges. Thus it is that life comes in at\r\nthe base of the Cambrian in Wales, and it may be regarded as a fair\r\nspecimen of the facts as they appear in the earlier fossiliferous beds\r\nsucceeding the Laurentian. Taking the first of these groups of fossils,\r\nwe may recognise in the worms representatives of those that still\r\nhaunt our shores, in the Trilobite a Crustacean or Arachnoid of no\r\nmean grade. The _Lingulellæ_, whether we regard them as molluscoids,\r\nor, with Professor Morse, as singularly specialized worms, represent a\r\npeculiar and distinct type, handed down, through all the vicissitudes\r\nof the geological ages, to the present day. Had the Primordial life\r\nbegun with species altogether inscrutable and unexampled in succeeding\r\nages, this would no doubt have been mysterious; but next to this is\r\nthe mystery of the oldest forms of life being also among the newest.\r\nOne great fact shines here with the clearness of noon-day. Whatever\r\nthe origin of these creatures, they represent families which have\r\nendured till now in the struggle for existence without either elevation\r\nor degradation. Here, again, we may formulate another creative law.\r\nIn every great group there are some forms much more capable of long\r\ncontinuance than others. Lingula among the Brachiopods is a marked\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\n[70] Probably of the genus Olenellus.\r\n\r\nBut when, with Hicks, we surmount the mass of barren beds underlying\r\nthese remains, which from its unfossiliferous character is probably a\r\nsomewhat rapid deposit of Arctic mud, like that which in all geological\r\ntime has constituted the rough filling of our continental formations,\r\nand have suddenly sprung upon us many genera of Trilobites, including\r\nthe fewest-jointed and most many-jointed, the smallest and the largest\r\nof their race, our astonishment must increase, till we recognise the\r\nfact that we are now in the presence of another great law of creation,\r\nwhich provides that every new type shall be rapidly extended to the\r\nextreme limits of its power of adaptation.\r\n\r\nThat this is not merely local is evidenced by the researches of\r\nMatthew and Walcott in the oldest Cambrian of America, where a similar\r\nsuccession occurs, but with this difference, that in the wider area\r\npresented by the American continent we find a greater variety of\r\nforms of life. Walcott records up to 1892 no less than 67 genera\r\nand 165 species in the oldest Cambrian of America. These include\r\nrepresentatives of the Sponges, Hydroids, Corals, Echinoderms, Worms,\r\nBrachiopods, Bivalve and Univalve Mollusks and Crustaceans, or in\r\nother words, all the leading groups of invertebrate animals that\r\nwe find in the sea at present. Of these the dominant group is the\r\nCrustaceans, including Trilobites, numbering one-third of the whole;\r\nand these with the univalve Mollusks and the Brachiopods constitute\r\nthe majority, the other groups having comparatively few species. What\r\na marvellous incoming of life is here! Walcott may well say that on\r\nthe theory of gradual development we must suppose that life existed at\r\na period far before the Cambrian--as far, indeed, as the Cambrian is\r\nbefore our own time. But this would mean that we know only half of the\r\nhistory of life; and perhaps it is more reasonable to suppose that when\r\nthe conditions became favourable, it came in with a rush.\r\n\r\nBefore considering the other laws that may be inferred from these\r\nfacts, however, let us in imagination transfer ourselves back to the\r\nPrimordial age, and suppose that we have in our hands a living specimen\r\nof one of the larger Trilobites, recently taken from the sea, flapping\r\nvigorously its great tail, and full of life and energy; an animal\r\nlarger and heavier than the modern king-crab of our shores, furnished\r\nwith all the complexity of external parts for which the crustaceans are\r\nso remarkable, and no doubt with instincts and feelings and modes of\r\naction as pronounced as those of its modern allies, and, if Woodward's\r\nviews are correct, on a higher plane of rank than the king-crab itself,\r\ninasmuch as it is a composite type connecting Limuli with Isopods,\r\nand even with scorpions. We have obviously here, in the appearance of\r\nthis great Crustacean or Arachnoid, a repetition of the facts which\r\nwe met with in Eozoon; but how vast the interval between them in\r\ngeological time, and in zoological rank! Standing in the presence of\r\nthis testimony, I think it is only right to say that we possess no\r\ncausal solution of the appearance of these early forms of life; but in\r\ntracing them and their successors upward through the succeeding ages,\r\nwe may hope at least to reach some expressions of the laws of their\r\nsuccession, in possession of which we may return to attack the mystery\r\nof their origin.\r\n\r\nFirst, it must strike every observer that there is a great sameness\r\nof plan throughout the whole history of marine invertebrate life. If\r\nwe turn over the pages of an illustrated text-book of geology, or\r\nexamine the cases or drawers of a collection of fossils, we shall find\r\nextending through every succeeding formation, representative forms of\r\nCrustaceans, Mollusks, Corals, etc., in such a manner as to indicate\r\nthat in each successive period there has been a reproduction of the\r\nsame type with modifications; and if the series is not continuous, this\r\nappears to be due rather to abrupt physical changes; since sometimes,\r\nwhere two formations pass into each other, we find a gradual change in\r\nthe fossils by the dropping out and introduction of species one by one.\r\nThus, in the whole of the great Palæozoic Period, both in its Fauna and\r\nFlora, we have a continuity and similarity of a most marked character.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that there is presented to us in this similarity of the\r\nforms of successive faunas and floras, a phenomenon which deserves very\r\ncareful sifting as to the question of identity or diversity of species.\r\nThe data for its comprehension must be obtained by careful study of\r\nthe series of closely allied forms occurring in successive formations,\r\nand the great and undisturbed areas of the older rocks in America seem\r\nto give special facilities for this, which should be worked, not in\r\nthe direction of constituting new species for every slightly divergent\r\nform, but in striving to group these forms into large specific\r\ntypes.[71]\r\n\r\n[71] The Rynchonellæ of the type of _R. plena_, the Orthids, of\r\nthe type of _O. testudinaria_, the Strophomenæ of the types of _S.\r\nalternata_ and _S. Rhomboidalis_, the Atrypæ of the type of _A.\r\nreticularis_, furnish cases in point among the Brachiopods.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to preclude the supposition that some of the groups\r\nmentioned in the note are really specific types, with numerous race\r\nmodifications. My own provisional conclusion, based on the study of\r\nPalæozoic plants, is that the general law will be found to be the\r\nexistence of distinct specific types, independent of each other, but\r\nliable in geological time to a great many modifications, which have\r\noften been regarded as distinct species.[72]\r\n\r\n[72] \"Geological History of Plants.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this unity of successive faunæ at first sight presents an\r\nappearance of hereditary succession, it loses much of this character\r\nwhen we consider the number of new types introduced without apparent\r\npredecessors, the necessity that there should be similarity of type\r\nin successive faunæ on any hypothesis of a continuous plan; and above\r\nall, the fact that the recurrence of representative species or races\r\nin large proportion marks times of decadence rather than of expansion\r\nin the types to which they belong. To turn to another period, this is\r\nvery manifest in that singular resemblance which obtains between the\r\nmodern mammals of South America and Australia, and their immediate\r\nfossil predecessors--the phenomenon being here manifestly that of\r\ndecadence of large and abundant species into a few depauperated\r\nrepresentatives. This will be found to be a very general law, elevation\r\nbeing accompanied by the apparent abrupt appearance of new types and\r\ndecadence by the apparent continuation of old species, or modifications\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThis resemblance with difference in successive faunas also connects\r\nitself very directly with the successive elevations and depressions\r\nof our continental plateaus in geological time. Every great Palæozoic\r\nlimestone, for example, indicates a depression with succeeding\r\nelevation. On each elevation marine animals were driven back into the\r\nocean, and on each depression swarmed in over the land, reinforced\r\nby new species, either then introduced, or derived by migration from\r\nother localities. In like manner, on every depression, land plants and\r\nanimals were driven in upon insular areas, and on re-elevation, again\r\nspread themselves widely. Now I think it will be found to be a law here\r\nthat periods of expansion were eminently those of introduction of new\r\nspecific types, and periods of contraction those of extinction, and\r\nalso of continuance of old types under new varietal forms.\r\n\r\nIt must also be noticed that all the leading types of invertebrate\r\nlife were early introduced, that change within these was necessarily\r\nlimited, and that elevation could take place mainly by the introduction\r\nof the vertebrate orders. So in plants, Cryptogams early attained\r\ntheir maximum as well as Gymnosperms, and elevation occurred in the\r\nintroduction of Phænogams, and this not piecemeal, but as we shall see\r\nin a succeeding chapter, in great force at once.\r\n\r\nWe may further remark the simultaneous appearance of like types of life\r\nin one and the same geological period, over widely separated regions of\r\nthe earth's surface. This strikes us especially in the comparatively\r\nsimple and homogeneous life-dynasties of the Palæozoic, when, for\r\nexample, we find the same types of Silurian Graptolites, Trilobites and\r\nBrachiopods appearing simultaneously in Australia, America and Europe.\r\nPerhaps in no department is it more impressive than in the introduction\r\nof the Devonian and Carboniferous Ages of that grand cryptogamous\r\nand gymnospermous flora which ranges from Brazil to Spitzbergen, and\r\nfrom Australia to Scotland, accompanied in all by the same groups of\r\nmarine invertebrates. Such facts may depend either on that long life of\r\nspecific types which gives them ample time to spread to all possible\r\nhabitats, before their extinction, or on some general law whereby the\r\nconditions suitable to similar types of life emerge at one time in all\r\nparts of the world. Both causes may be influential, as the one does\r\nnot exclude the other, and there is reason to believe that both are\r\nnatural facts. Should it be ultimately proved that species allied and\r\nrepresentative, but distinct in origin, come into being simultaneously\r\neverywhere, we shall arrive at one of the laws of creation, and one\r\nprobably connected with the gradual change of the physical conditions\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\nAnother general truth, obvious from the facts which have been already\r\ncollected, is the periodicity of introduction of species. They come\r\nin by bursts or flood tides at particular points of time, while these\r\ngreat life waves are followed and preceded by times of ebb in which\r\nlittle that is new is being produced. We labour in our investigation of\r\nthis matter under the disadvantage that the modern period is evidently\r\none of the times of pause in the creative work. Had our time been\r\nthat of the early Tertiary or early Mesozoic, our views as to the\r\nquestion of origin of species might have been very different. It is a\r\nstriking fact, in illustration of this, that since the glacial age no\r\nnew species of mammal, except, possibly, man himself, can be proved to\r\nhave originated on our continents, while a great number of large and\r\nconspicuous forms have disappeared. It is possible that the proximate\r\nor secondary causes of the ebb and flow of life production may be in\r\npart at least physical, but other and more important efficient causes\r\nmay be behind these. In any case these undulations in the history of\r\nlife are in harmony with much that we see in other departments of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nIt results from the above and the immediately preceding statement,\r\nthat specific and generic types enter on the stage in great force,\r\nand gradually taper off towards extinction. They should so appear in\r\nthe geological diagrams made to illustrate the succession of living\r\nbeings. This applies even to those forms of life which come in with\r\nfewest species and under the most humble guise. What a remarkable\r\nswarming, for example, there must have been of Marsupial Mammals in\r\nthe early Mesozoic, and in the Coal formation the only known Pulmonate\r\nsnails, five or six in number, belong to four generic types, while the\r\nMyriapods and Amphibians alike appear in a crowd of generic forms.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the permanence of species in geological\r\ntime. We may now place this in connection with the law of rapid\r\norigination and more or less continuous transmission of varietal forms.\r\nA good illustration will be afforded by a group of species with which\r\nI am very familiar, that which came into our seas at the beginning of\r\nthe Glacial age, and still exists. With regard to their permanence, it\r\ncan be affirmed that the shells now elevated in Wales to 1,200, and in\r\nCanada to 600 feet above the sea, and which lived before the last great\r\nrevolution of our continents a period very remote as compared with\r\nhuman history--differ in no tittle from their modern successors after\r\nhundreds or thousands of generations. It can also be affirmed that the\r\nmore variable species appear under precisely the same varietal forms\r\nthen as now, though these varieties have changed much in their local\r\ndistribution. The real import of these statements, which might also\r\nbe made with regard to other groups, well known to palæontologists,\r\nis of so great significance that it can be realized only after we\r\nhave thought of the vast time and numerous changes through which\r\nthese humble creatures have survived. I may call in evidence here a\r\nfamiliar New England animal, the common sand clam, _Mya arenaria_, and\r\nits relative _Mya truncata_, the short sand clam, which now inhabit\r\ntogether all the northern seas; for the Pacific specimens, from Japan\r\nand California, though differently named, are undoubtedly the same.\r\n_Mya truncata_ appears in Europe in the Coralline Crag, and was\r\nfollowed by _M. arenaria_ in the Red Crag. Both shells occur in the\r\nPleistocene of America, and their several varietal forms had already\r\ndeveloped themselves in the Crag, and remain the same to-day; so that\r\nthese humble mollusks, littoral in their habits, and subjected to a\r\ngreat variety of conditions, have continued for a very long period\r\nto construct their shells precisely as at present; while in many\r\nplaces, as on the Lower St. Lawrence, we find them living together on\r\nthe same banks, and yet preserving their distinctness.[73] Nor are\r\nthere any indications of a transition between the two species. I might\r\nmake similar statements with regard to the Astartes, Buccinums and\r\nTellinæ of the drift, and could illustrate them by extensive series of\r\nspecimens from my own collections.\r\n\r\n[73] Paper in _Record of Science_, on Shells at Little Metis.\r\n\r\nAnother curious illustration is that presented by the Tertiary and\r\nmodern faunæ of some oceanic islands far separated from the continents.\r\nIn Madeira and Porto Santo, for example, according to Lyell, we have\r\nfifty-six species of land shells in the former, and forty-two in the\r\nlatter, only twelve being common to the two, though these islands are\r\nonly thirty miles apart. Now in the Pliocene strata of Madeira and\r\nPorto Santo we find thirty-six species in the former, and thirty-five\r\nin the latter, of which only eight per cent, are extinct, and yet\r\nonly eight are common to the two islands. Further, there seem to be\r\nno transitional forms connecting the species, and of some of them the\r\nsame varieties existed in the Pliocene as now. The main difference\r\nin time is the extinction of some species and the introduction of\r\nothers without known connecting links, and the fact that some species,\r\nplentiful in the Pliocene, are rare now, and _vice versâ_. All these\r\nshells differ from those of modern Europe, but some of them are allied\r\nto Miocene species of that continent. Here we have a case of continued\r\nexistence of the same forms, and in circumstances which, the more we\r\nthink of them, the more do they defy all our existing theories as to\r\nspecific origins.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of the most remarkable facts in connection with the\r\npermanence of varietal forms of species are those furnished by that\r\nmagnificent flora which burst in all its majesty on the American\r\ncontinent in the Cretaceous period, and still survives among us, even\r\nin some of its specific types. I say survives; for we have but a\r\nremnant of its forms living, and comparatively little that is new has\r\nprobably been added since. The confusion which has obtained as to the\r\nage of this flora, and its mistaken reference to the Miocene Tertiary,\r\nhave arisen in part from the fact that this modern flora was in its\r\nearlier times contemporary with Cretaceous animals, and survived the\r\ngradual change from the animal life of the Cretaceous down to that of\r\nthe Eocene, and even of the Miocene. In collections of these plants,\r\nfrom what may be termed beds of transition from the Cretaceous to the\r\nTertiary, we find many plants of modern species, or so closely related\r\nthat they may be mere varietal forms. Some of these will be mentioned\r\nin the next paper, and they show that modern plants, some of them\r\nsmall and insignificant, others of gigantic size, reach back to a time\r\nwhen the Mesozoic Dinosaurs were becoming extinct, and the earliest\r\nPlacental mammals being introduced. Shall we say that these plants\r\nhave propagated themselves unchanged for half a million of years, or\r\nmore?[74]\r\n\r\n[74] Among these are living species of ferns, one of them our common\r\n\"Sensitive Fern,\" of Eastern America, two species of Hazel still\r\nextant, and Sequoias or giant pines, like those now surviving in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nTake from the western Mesozoic a contrasting yet illustrative fact. In\r\nthe lowest Cretaceous rocks of Queen Charlotte's Island, Mr. Richardson\r\nand Dr. G. M. Dawson find Ammonites and allied Cephalopods similar\r\nin many respects to those discovered farther south by the California\r\nSurvey, and Mr. Whiteaves finds that some of them are apparently\r\nnot distinct from species described by the Palæontologists of the\r\nGeological Survey of British India. On both sides of the Pacific these\r\nshells lie entombed in solid rock, and the Pacific rolls between, as\r\nof yore. Yet these species, genera, and even families are all extinct\r\nwhy, no man can tell, while land plants that must have come in while\r\nthe survivors of these Cephalopods still lived, reach down to the\r\npresent. How mysterious is all this, and how strongly does it show the\r\nindependence in some sense of merely physical agencies on the part of\r\nthe manifestations of life!\r\n\r\nWe have naturally been occupied hitherto with the lower tribes of\r\nanimals and with plant life, because these are predominant in the\r\nearly ages of the earth. Let us turn now to the history of vertebrate\r\nor back-boned animals, which presents some peculiarities special to\r\nitself. Many years ago Pander[75] described and figured from the\r\nCambro-Silurian of Russia, a number of minute teeth, some conical and\r\nsome comb-like, which he referred to fishes, and to that low form\r\nof the fish type represented by the modern lampreys. Much doubt was\r\nthrown on this determination, more especially as the teeth seemed\r\nto be composed not of bone earth, but of carbonate of lime, and it\r\nwas suggested that they may have belonged to marine worms, or to the\r\nlingual ribbons of Gastropod mollusks. Some confirmatory evidence seems\r\nto have been supplied by the discovery of great numbers of similar\r\nforms in the shales of the coal formation of Ohio, by the late Dr.\r\nNewberry. I have had an opportunity to examine these, and find that\r\nthey consist of calcium phosphate,[76] or bone earth, and that their\r\nmicroscopic structure is not dissimilar from that of the teeth of some\r\nof the smaller sharks (Diplodus) found with them. I have therefore\r\nbeen inclined to believe that there may have already been, even in the\r\nCambrian or Lower Silurian seas, true fishes, related partly to the\r\nlampreys and partly to sharks; so that the history of the back-boned\r\nanimals may have gone nearly as far back as that of their humbler\r\nrelations. This conjecture has recently received further support\r\nfrom the discovery in rocks of Lower Silurian age, in Colorado of a\r\nveritable bone bed, rich in fragmentary remains of fishes. They are\r\nunfortunately so comminuted as to resemble the _débris_ of the food\r\nof some larger animal; but in so far as I can judge from specimens\r\nkindly given to me,[77] they resemble the bony coverings of some of\r\nthe familiar fishes of the Devonian. Thus they would indicate, with\r\nPander's and Rohan's specimens, already two distinct types of fishes as\r\nexisting almost as early as the higher invertebrates of the sea.\r\n\r\n[75] More recently Rohan has described conical teeth (St. Petersburg\r\nAcademy, 1889), but I have not seen his paper.\r\n\r\n[76] Analysis of Dr. B. J. Harrington.\r\n\r\n[77] By Mr. F. D. Adams and Dr. Walcott.\r\n\r\nIn the Silurian (Upper Silurian of Murchison) we have undoubted\r\nevidence of the same kind, on both sides of the Atlantic, in teeth and\r\nspines of sharks, and the plates which protected the heads and bodies\r\nof the plate-covered fishes (Placo-ganoids). But it is in the Devonian\r\nthat these types appear to culminate, and we have added to them that\r\nremarkable type of \"lung fish,\" as the Germans call them, represented\r\nin our modern world only by the curious and exceptional Burramunda\r\nof Australia, and the mud fishes of Africa and South America,[78]\r\ncreatures which show, as do some of the mailed fishes, or ganoids, of\r\nequally great age, the intermediate stages between a swimming bladder\r\nand a lung, and thus approach nearer to the air-breathing animals than\r\nany other fishes.\r\n\r\n[78] Ceratodus, Lipidosiren, Protopterus.\r\n\r\nMany years ago, in \"Acadian Geology,\" I referred to the probability\r\nthat the mailed and lung fishes of the Devonian and Carboniferous\r\npossessed air bladders so constructed as to enable them to breathe air,\r\nas is the case with their modern representatives. In the modern species\r\nthis, no doubt, enables them to haunt badly aërated waters, in swamps\r\nand sluggish streams, and in some cases even to survive when the water\r\nin which they live is dried up. In the Carboniferous and Devonian it\r\nmay have served a similar purpose, fitting them to inhabit the lagoons\r\nand creeks of the coal swamps, the water of which must often have\r\nbeen badly aërated. It makes against this that some sharks followed\r\nthem into these waters, and the modern sharks have no swim-bladders.\r\nPossibly, however, the sharks habitually haunted the open sea, and only\r\nmade occasional raids on the dangerous waters tenanted by the ganoids.\r\nIt is also true that only certain genera of sharks are found to be\r\nrepresented in the carbonaceous shales, and they may have differed\r\nin this respect from the ordinary forms of the order. It has been\r\nsuggested that only a small change would be necessary to enable some\r\nof these lung fishes to become Batrachians, and no doubt this is the\r\nnearest approach of the fish to the reptile; but we have not yet found\r\nconnecting links sufficient to bridge over the whole distance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two Primitive Vertebrates, _Palæospondylus_\r\n(enlarged) and _Pterichthys_ (reduced), (After Woodward, with some\r\nmodifications.)]\r\n\r\nThe plate-bearing ganoids of the Silurian and Devonian, at one time\r\nsupposed to be allied to Crustaceans, but whose dignity as \"Forerunners\r\nof the back-boned animals\" is now generally admitted,[79] are clearly\r\ntrue fishes, and of somewhat high rank, their strange bony armour being\r\nevidently a special protection against the attacks of contemporary\r\nsharks and gigantic crustaceans; and if we may judge by the Colorado\r\nspecimens, their existence dates back almost to the close of the\r\nCambrian, and they were probably contemporary with small sharks; while\r\nas early as the Silurian and Devonian, if we regard the scaly ganoids\r\nas a distinct type, we have already four types of fishes, and these\r\nakin to those which in modern time we must regard as the highest of\r\ntheir class.\r\n\r\n[79] A. Smith Woodward, \"Natural Science,\" 1892, and _Annals and Maga.\r\nNat. Hist._, October, 1890. This able naturalist, in introducing his\r\nsubject, remarks, from the point of view of an evolutionist:--\"Whether\r\nsome form of 'worm' gave origin to the forerunners of the great\r\nback-boned race, or whether a primeval relative of the King-crab\r\nturned upside down and rearranged limbs and head these are questions\r\nstill admitting of endless discussion, no doubt fruitless in their\r\nmain object, but desirable from the new lines of investigation they\r\ncontinually suggest.\"\r\n\r\nOne very little fish of the Devonian, of which specimens have been\r\nkindly sent me by a friend in Scotland,[80] the Palæospondylus of\r\nTraquair, may raise still higher hopes for the early vertebrates. It is\r\na little creature, an inch to two inches in length, destitute or nearly\r\ndestitute of bony covering, having a head which suggests the presence\r\nof external gills, large eyes, and even elongated nasal bones,[81] a\r\nlong vertebral column composed of separate bony rings, more than fifty\r\nin number, with possible indications of ribs in front and distinct\r\nneural and haemal processes behind. One cannot look at it without the\r\nsuggestion occurring of some of the smaller snake-like Batrachians of\r\nthe Carboniferous and Permian; and I should not be surprised if it\r\nshould come to be regarded either as a forerunner of the Batrachians or\r\nas a primitive tadpole.\r\n\r\n[80] James Reed, Esq., of Allan House, Blairgowrie.\r\n\r\n[81] I am aware that Woodward regards these parts differently.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the upper part of the Devonian, though rich in\r\nfishes and plants, has afforded no higher vertebrates than its lower\r\nparts, and in the lowest Carboniferous beds we suddenly find ourselves\r\nin the presence of Batrachians with well-developed limbs and characters\r\nwhich ally them to the Lizards. True lizard-like reptiles appear in\r\nthe Permian, and then we enter on that marvellous reign of reptiles,\r\nin which this class assumed so many great and remarkable forms, and\r\nasserted itself in a manner of which the now degraded reptilian class\r\ncan afford no conception.\r\n\r\nThe mammals and birds make their first appearance quietly in small and\r\nhumble forms in the reign of reptiles, in which there was little place\r\nleft for them by the latter; but the mammals burst upon us in all their\r\nnumber and magnitude in the Eocene and Miocene, in which quadrupedal\r\nmammalian life may be said to have culminated in grandeur, variety, and\r\ngeographical distribution; far excelling in these respects the time in\r\nwhich we live.\r\n\r\nThe development in time of the back-boned animals thus stands in\r\nsome degree by itself; but it illustrates the same laws of early\r\ngeneralised types, and sudden and wide introduction of new forms, which\r\nwe have seen in the case of the invertebrates and the plants.\r\n\r\nSuch facts as those to which I have referred, and many others, which\r\nwant of space prevents me from noticing, are in one respect eminently\r\nunsatisfactory, for they show us how difficult must be any attempts\r\nto explain the origin and succession of life. For this reason they\r\nare quietly put aside or explained away in most of the current\r\nhypotheses on the subject. But we must, as men of science, face these\r\ndifficulties, and be content to search for facts and laws, even if they\r\nshould prove fatal to preconceived views.\r\n\r\nA group of new laws, indeed, here breaks upon us. (1) The great\r\nvitality and rapid extension and variation of new specific types. (2)\r\nThe law of spontaneous decay and mortality of species in time. (3) The\r\nlaw of periodicity and of simultaneous appearance of many allied forms.\r\n(4) The abrupt entrance and slow decay of groups of species. (5) The\r\nextremely long duration of some species in time. (6) The grand march of\r\nnew forms landwards, and upwards in rank. Such general truths deeply\r\nimpress us at least with the conclusion that we are tracing, not a\r\nfortuitous succession, but the action of power working by law.\r\n\r\nI have thus far said nothing of the bearing of the prevalent ideas of\r\ndescent with modification on this wonderful procession of life. None\r\nof these, of course, can be expected to take us back to the origin of\r\nliving beings; but they also fail to explain why so vast numbers of\r\nhighly organized species struggle into existence simultaneously in one\r\nage and disappear in another, why no continuous chain of succession in\r\ntime can be found gradually blending species into each other, and why,\r\nin the natural succession of things, degradation under the influence\r\nof external conditions and final extinction seem to be laws of organic\r\nexistence. It is useless here to appeal to the imperfection of the\r\nrecord, or to the movements or migrations of species. The record is\r\nnow, in many important parts, too complete, and the simultaneousness\r\nof the entrance of the faunas and floras too certainly established,\r\nand moving species from place to place only evades the difficulty. The\r\ntruth is that such hypotheses are at present premature, and that we\r\nrequire to have larger collections of facts. Independently of this,\r\nhowever, it appears to me that from a philosophical point of view it\r\nis extremely probable that all theories of evolution, as at present\r\napplied to life, are fundamentally defective in being too partial in\r\ntheir character; and perhaps I cannot better group the remainder of the\r\nfacts to which I wish to refer than by using them to illustrate this\r\nfeature of most of our attempts at generalization on this subject.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, these hypotheses are too partial, in their tendency to\r\nrefer numerous and complex phenomena to one cause, or to a few causes\r\nonly, when all trustworthy analogy would indicate that they must result\r\nfrom many concurrent forces and determinations of force. We have all,\r\nno doubt, read those ingenious, not to say amusing, speculations in\r\nwhich some entomologists and botanists have indulged with reference to\r\nthe mutual relations of flowers and suctorial insects. Geologically\r\nthe facts oblige us to begin with Cryptogamous plants and chewing\r\ninsects, and out of the desire of insects for non-existent honey,\r\nand the adaptations of plants to the requirements of non-existent\r\nsuctorial apparatus, we have to evolve the marvellous complexity of\r\nfloral form and colouring, and the exquisitely delicate apparatus\r\nof the mouths of haustellate insects. Now, when it is borne in mind\r\nthat this theory implies a mental confusion on our part precisely\r\nsimilar to that which, in the department of mechanics, actuates the\r\nseekers for perpetual motion, that we have not the smallest tittle of\r\nevidence that the changes required have actually occurred in any one\r\ncase, and that the thousands of other structures and relations of the\r\nplant and the insect have to be worked out by a series of concurrent\r\ndevelopments so complex and absolutely incalculable in the aggregate,\r\nthat the cycles and epicycles of the Ptolemaic astronomy were child's\r\nplay in comparison, we need not wonder that the common sense of mankind\r\nrevolts against such fancies, and that we are accused of attempting to\r\nconstruct the universe by methods that would baffle Omnipotence itself,\r\nbecause they are simply absurd. In this aspect of them, indeed, such\r\nspeculations are necessarily futile, because no mind can grasp all the\r\ncomplexities of even any one case, and it is useless to follow out an\r\nimaginary line of development which unexplained facts must contradict\r\nat every step. This is also, no doubt, the reason why all recent\r\nattempts at constructing \"Phylogenies\" are so changeable, and why no\r\ntwo experts can agree about almost any of them.\r\n\r\nA second aspect in which such speculations are too partial, is in\r\nthe unwarranted use which they make of analogy. It is not unusual to\r\nfind such analogies as that between the embryonic development of the\r\nindividual animal and the succession of animals in geological time\r\nplaced on a level with that reasoning from analogy by which geologists\r\napply modern causes to explain geological formations. No claim could\r\nbe more unfounded. When the geologist studies ancient limestones built\r\nup of the remains of corals, and then applies the phenomena of modern\r\ncoral reefs to explain their origin, he brings the latter to bear\r\non the former by an analogy which includes not merely the apparent\r\nresults, but the causes at work, and the conditions of their action,\r\nand it is on this that the validity of his comparison depends, in so\r\nfar as it relates to similarity of mode of formation. But when we\r\ncompare the development of an animal from an embryo cell with the\r\nprogress of animals in time, though we have a curious analogy as to the\r\nsteps of the process, the conditions and causes at work are known to\r\nbe altogether dissimilar, and therefore we have no evidence whatever\r\nas to identity of cause, and our reasoning becomes at once the most\r\ntransparent of fallacies. Further, we have no right here to overlook\r\nthe fact that the conditions of the embryo are determined by those of\r\na previous adult, and that no sooner does this hereditary potentiality\r\nproduce a new adult animal, than the terrible external agencies of the\r\nphysical world, in presence of which all life exists, begin to tell on\r\nthe organism, and after a struggle of longer or shorter duration it\r\nsuccumbs to death, and its substance returns into inorganic nature, a\r\nlaw from which even the longer life of the species does not seem to\r\nexempt it. All this is so plain and manifest that it is extraordinary\r\nthat evolutionists will continue to use such partial and imperfect\r\narguments. Another illustration may be taken from that application\r\nof the doctrine of natural selection to explain the introduction of\r\nspecies in geological time, which is so elaborately discussed by Sir\r\nC. Lyell in the last edition of his \"Principles of Geology.\" The great\r\ngeologist evidently leans strongly to the theory, and claims for it\r\nthe \"highest degree of probability,\" yet he perceives that there is a\r\nserious gap in it; since no modern fact has ever proved the origin of a\r\nnew species by modification. Such a gap, if it existed in those grand\r\nanalogies by which he explained geological formations through modern\r\ncauses, would be admitted to be fatal.\r\n\r\nA third illustration of the partial character of these hypotheses may\r\nbe taken from the use made of the theory deduced from modern physical\r\ndiscoveries, that life must be merely a product of the continuous\r\noperation of physical laws. The assumption for it is nothing more\r\nthat the phenomena of life are produced merely by some arrangement\r\nof physical forces, even if it be admitted to be true, gives only a\r\npartial explanation of the possible origin of life. It does not account\r\nfor the fact that life, as a force, or combination of forces, is set in\r\nantagonism to all other forces. It does not account for the marvellous\r\nconnection of life with organization. It does not account for the\r\ndetermination and arrangement of forces implied in life. A very simple\r\nillustration may make this plain. If the problem to be solved were the\r\norigin of the mariner's compass, one might assert that it is wholly a\r\nphysical arrangement, both as to matter and force. Another might assert\r\nthat it involves mind and intelligence in addition. In some sense\r\nboth would be right. The properties of magnetic force and of iron or\r\nsteel are purely physical, and it might even be within the bounds of\r\npossibility that somewhere in the universe a mass of natural lodestone\r\nmay have been so balanced as to swing in harmony with the earth's\r\nmagnetism. Yet we would surely be regarded as very credulous if we\r\ncould be induced to believe that the mariner's compass has originated\r\nin that way. This argument applies with a thousandfold greater force to\r\nthe origin of life, which involves even in its simplest forms so many\r\nmore adjustments of force and so much more complex machinery.\r\n\r\nFourthly, these hypotheses are partial, inasmuch as they fail to\r\naccount for the vastly varied and correlated interdependencies of\r\nnatural things and forces, and for the unity of plan which pervades the\r\nwhole. These can be explained only by taking into the account another\r\nelement from without. Even when it professes to admit the existence\r\nof a God, the evolutionist reasoning of our day contents itself\r\naltogether with the physical or visible universe, and leaves entirely\r\nout of sight the power of the unseen and spiritual, as if this were\r\nsomething with which science has nothing to do, but which belongs only\r\nto imagination or sentiment. So much has this been the case, that when\r\nrecently a few physicists and naturalists have referred to the \"Unseen\r\nUniverse,\" they have seemed to be teaching new and startling truths,\r\nthough only reviving some of the oldest and most permanent ideas of\r\nour race. From the dawn of human thought it has been the conclusion\r\nalike of philosophers, theologians, and the common sense of mankind,\r\nthat the seen can be explained only by reference to the unseen, and\r\nthat any merely physical theory of the world is necessarily partial.\r\nThis, too, is the position of our sacred Scriptures, and is broadly\r\nstated in their opening verse, and indeed it lies alike at the basis\r\nof all true religion and all sound philosophy, for it must necessarily\r\nbe that \"the things that are seen are temporal, the things that are\r\nunseen, eternal.\" With reference to the primal aggregation of energy in\r\nthe visible universe, with reference to the introduction of life, with\r\nreference to the soul of man, with reference to the heavenly gifts of\r\ngenius and prophecy, with reference to the introduction of the Saviour\r\nHimself into the world, and with reference to the spiritual gifts and\r\ngraces of God's people, all these spring, not from sporadic acts of\r\nintervention, but from the continuous action of God and the unseen\r\nworld; and this, we must never forget, is the true ideal of creation in\r\nScripture and in sound theology. Only in such exceptional and little\r\ninfluential philosophies as that of Democritus, and in the speculations\r\nof a few men carried off their balance by the brilliant physical\r\ndiscoveries of our age, has this necessarily partial and imperfect view\r\nbeen adopted. Never, indeed, was its imperfection more clear than in\r\nthe light of modern science.\r\n\r\nGeology, by tracing back all present things to their origin, was the\r\nfirst science to establish on a basis of observed facts the necessity\r\nof a beginning and end of the world. But even physical science now\r\nteaches us that the visible universe is a vast machine for the\r\ndissipation of energy; that the processes going on in it must have had\r\na beginning in time, and that all things tend to a final and helpless\r\nequilibrium. This necessity implies an unseen power, an invisible\r\nuniverse, in which the visible universe must have originated, and to\r\nwhich its energy is ever returning. The hiatus between the seen and the\r\nunseen may be bridged over by the conceptions of atomic vortices of\r\nforce, and by the universal and continuous ether; but whether or not,\r\nit has become clear that the conception of the unseen, as existing,\r\nhas become necessary to our belief in the possible existence of the\r\nphysical universe itself, even without taking life into account.\r\n\r\nIt is in the domain of life, however, that this necessity becomes most\r\napparent; and it is in the plant that we first clearly perceive a\r\nvisible testimony to that unseen which is the counterpart of the seen.\r\nLife in the plant opposes the outward rush of force in our system,\r\narrests a part of it on its way, fixes it as potential energy, and\r\nthus, forming a mere eddy, so to speak, in the process of dissipation\r\nof energy, it accumulates that on which animal life and man himself may\r\nsubsist, and assert for a time supremacy over the seen and temporal on\r\nbehalf of the unseen and eternal. I say, for a time, because life is,\r\nin the visible universe, as at present constituted, but a temporary\r\nexception, introduced from that unseen world where it is no longer\r\nthe exception but the eternal rule. In a still higher sense, then,\r\nthan that in which matter and force testify to a Creator, organization\r\nand life, whether in the plant, the animal, or man, bear the same\r\ntestimony, and exist as outposts put forth in the succession of ages\r\nfrom that higher heaven that surrounds the visible universe. In them,\r\ntoo, Almighty power is no doubt conditioned or limited by law; yet they\r\nbear more distinctly upon them the impress of their Maker, and, while\r\nall explanations of the physical universe which refuse to recognise its\r\nspiritual and unseen origin must necessarily be partial and in the end\r\nincomprehensible, this destiny falls more quickly and surely on the\r\nattempt to account for life and its succession on merely materialistic\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nHere again, however, we must bear in mind that creation, as maintained\r\nagainst such materialistic evolution, whether by theology, philosophy,\r\nor Holy Scripture, is necessarily a continuous, nay, an eternal,\r\ninfluence, not an intervention of disconnected acts. It is the true\r\ncontinuity, which includes and binds together all other continuity.\r\n\r\nIt is here that natural science meets with theology, not as an\r\nantagonist, but as a friend and ally in its time of greatest need;\r\nand I must here record my belief that neither men of science nor\r\ntheologians have a right to separate what God in Holy Scripture has\r\njoined together, or to build up a wall between nature and religion, and\r\nwrite upon it, \"no thoroughfare.\" The science that does this must be\r\nimpotent to explain nature, and without hold on the higher sentiments\r\nof man. The theology that does this must sink into mere superstition.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, can we formulate a few of the general laws, or perhaps I\r\nhad better call them the general conclusions, respecting life, in which\r\nall Palæontologists may agree. Perhaps it is not possible to do this at\r\npresent satisfactorily, but the attempt may do no harm. We may, then, I\r\nthink, make the following affirmations:--\r\n\r\n1. The existence of life and organization on the earth is not eternal,\r\nor even coeval with the beginning of the physical universe, but may\r\npossibly date from Laurentian or immediately pre-Laurentian ages.\r\n\r\n2. The introduction of new species of animals and plants has been a\r\ncontinuous process, not necessarily in the sense of derivation of\r\none species from another, but in the higher sense of the continued\r\noperation of the cause or causes which introduced life at first. This,\r\nas already stated, I take to be the true theological or Scriptural as\r\nwell as scientific idea of what we ordinarily and somewhat loosely term\r\ncreation.\r\n\r\n3. Though thus continuous, the process has not been uniform; but\r\nperiods of rapid production of species have alternated with others in\r\nwhich many disappeared and few were introduced. This may have been an\r\neffect of physical cycles reacting on the progress of life.\r\n\r\n4. Species, like individuals, have greater energy and vitality in\r\ntheir younger stages, and rapidly assume all their varietal forms, and\r\nextend themselves as widely as external circumstances will permit. Like\r\nindividuals also, they have their periods of old age and decay, though\r\nthe life of some species has been of enormous duration in comparison\r\nwith that of others; the difference appearing to be connected with\r\ndegrees of adaptation to different conditions of life.\r\n\r\n5. Many allied species, constituting groups of animals and plants, have\r\nmade their appearance at once in various parts of the earth, and these\r\ngroups have obeyed the same laws with the individual and the species in\r\nculminating rapidly, and then slowly diminishing, though a large group\r\nonce introduced has rarely disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\n6. Groups of species, as genera and orders, do not usually begin with\r\ntheir highest or lowest forms, but with intermediate and generalized\r\ntypes, and they show a capacity for both elevation and degradation in\r\ntheir subsequent history.\r\n\r\n7. The history of life presents a progress from the lower to the\r\nhigher, and from the simpler to the more complex, and from the more\r\ngeneralized to the more specialized. In this progress new types are\r\nintroduced, and take the place of the older ones, which sink to a\r\nrelatively subordinate place, and become thus degraded. But the\r\nphysical and organic changes have been so correlated and adjusted\r\nthat life has not only always maintained its existence, but has been\r\nenabled to assume more complex forms, and thus older forms have been\r\nmade to prepare the way for newer, so that there has been, on the\r\nwhole, a steady elevation culminating in man himself. Elevation and\r\nspecialization have, however, been secured at the expense of vital\r\nenergy and range of adaptation, until the new element of a rational and\r\ninventive nature was introduced only in the case of man.\r\n\r\n8. In regard to the larger and more distinct types, we cannot find\r\nevidence that they have, in their introduction, been preceded by\r\nsimilar forms connecting them with previous groups; but there is reason\r\nto believe that many supposed representative species in successive\r\nformations are really only races or varieties.\r\n\r\n9. In so far as we can trace their history, specific types are\r\npermanent in their characters from their introduction to their\r\nextinction, and their earlier varietal forms are similar to their later\r\nones.\r\n\r\n10. Palæontology furnishes no direct evidence, perhaps never can\r\nfurnish any, as to the actual transformation of one species into\r\nanother, or as to the actual circumstances of creation of a species;\r\nbut the drift of its testimony is to show that species come in _per\r\nsaltum_, rather than by any slow and gradual process.\r\n\r\n11. The origin and history of life cannot, any more than the origin\r\nand determination of matter and force, be explained on purely material\r\ngrounds, but involve the consideration of power referable to the unseen\r\nand spiritual world.\r\n\r\nDifferent minds may state these principles in different ways, but I\r\nbelieve that in so far as palæontology is concerned, in substance they\r\nmust hold good, at least as steps to higher truths. And now allow me\r\nto say that we should be thankful that it is given to us to deal with\r\nso great questions, and that in doing so, deep humiliation, earnest\r\nseeking for truth, patient collection of all facts, self-denying\r\nabstinence from hasty generalizations, forbearance and generous\r\nestimation with regard to our fellow labourers, and reliance on that\r\nDivine Spirit which has breathed into us our intelligent life, and is\r\nthe source of all true wisdom, are the qualities which best become us.\r\n\r\nBut while the principles noted above may be said to be known laws of\r\nthe apparition of new forms of life, they do not reach to the secondary\r\nefficient causes of the introduction of new species. What these may\r\nultimately prove to be, to what extent they can be known by us, and to\r\nwhat extent they may include processes of derivation, it is impossible\r\nnow to say. At present we must recognise in the prevailing theories on\r\nthe subject merely the natural tendency of the human mind to grasp the\r\nwhole mass of the unknown under some grand general hypothesis, which,\r\nthough perhaps little else than a figure of speech, satisfies for the\r\nmoment. We are dealing with the origin of species precisely as the\r\nalchemists did with chemistry, and as the Plutonists and Neptunists\r\ndid with geology; but the hypotheses of to-day may be the parents\r\nof investigations which will become real science to-morrow. In the\r\nmeantime it is safe to affirm that whatever amount of truth there may\r\nbe in the several hypotheses which have engaged our attention, there is\r\na creative force above and beyond them, and to the threshold of which\r\nwe shall inevitably be brought, after all their capabilities have been\r\nexhausted by rigid investigation of facts. It is also consolatory to\r\nknow that species, in so far as the Modern period, or any one past\r\ngeological period may be concerned, are so fixed that for all practical\r\npurposes they may be regarded as unchanging. They are to us what the\r\nplanets in their orbits are to the astronomer, and speculations as\r\nto the origin of species are merely our nebular hypotheses as to the\r\npossible origin of worlds and systems.\r\n\r\n  References:--Address as Vice-President of American Association at\r\n    Detroit, 1875. \"The Chain of Life in Geological Time,\" London,\r\n    1879.

But, as elsewhere stated, even it has beds of\r\nCarbon in the form of Graphite--veritable altered coal seams--which the\r\nanalogy of later formations would lead us to believe must have been\r\naccumulated by the growth of plants. This growth is indeed the only\r\nknown cause capable of producing such effects. If we should ever be\r\nfortunate enough to find beds of the Laurentian series in an unaltered\r\nstate, we may hope to know something of this old flora. Nor need we be\r\nsurprised if it should prove of higher grade and more noble development\r\nthan we should at first sight anticipate. If there ever was a time when\r\nvegetation alone possessed the earth, and when there were no animals to\r\ndevour or destroy it, we might expect to find it in its first and best\r\nestate, perhaps not comparable in variety and complexity of parts with\r\nthe flora of the modern world, but grand in its luxuriance and majesty.\r\nOf such discoveries, however, we have no certain indication at present.\r\n\r\nIf such a primeval flora as that above indicated ever existed, it must\r\nhave perished utterly before the incoming of the next great age of\r\nthe world--that known as the Palæozoic, whose rocks are surpassingly\r\nrich in the remains of animals, especially those of the lower or\r\ninvertebrate classes and those that inhabit the waters.\r\n\r\nIn the oldest Palæozoic rocks we find no plants certainly terrestrial,\r\nbut abundance of Algæ or seaweeds, and some gigantic members of the\r\nvegetable kingdom which seem to have been trees, with structures\r\nmore akin to those of aquatic than to those of land plants.[82] At a\r\nsomewhat early stage, however, in the rocks of this period, we discover\r\na few undoubted land plants.[83] These seem to be allied to the modern\r\nClub mosses and to their humble relations, the pillworts[84] and other\r\nsmall plants of similar structure found in ponds and swamps. Some of\r\nthem, indeed, appear to be intermediate between these groups. All\r\nthese plants are Cryptogams, or destitute of true flowers, but do not\r\nbelong to the lowest forms of that type. Thus, so far as we know, plant\r\nlife on the land began possibly with certain large trees of algoid\r\nstructures, and more certainly with the club mosses and pillworts and\r\ntheir allies, and these last in the form of species not tree-like in\r\ndimensions, but of very moderate size. The structures of these plants\r\nare already sufficiently well known to inform us that the plan and\r\nfunctions of the root, stem and leaf, and of spores and spore case\r\nwere set up; and that the structures and functions of vegetable cells,\r\nfibres and some kinds of vessels were perfected, and all the apparatus\r\nintroduced necessary for the fertilization and reproduction of plants\r\nof some degree of complexity. At the same time, the peculiar structures\r\nof the higher Algæ were brought to a pitch of perfection not surpassed\r\nif equalled in modern times, and which may have enabled plants so\r\nconstructed to exist even on the land.\r\n\r\n[82] Nematophyton, etc. See \"Geological History of Plants.\"\r\n\r\n[83] Psilophyton, Protannularia, etc.\r\n\r\n[84] Rhizocarpeæ.\r\n\r\nFrom these beginnings in the early Palæozoic, the progress of the\r\nvegetable kingdom went on, until, in the later parts of that great\r\nperiod, the Devonian and Carboniferous eras, it culminated in those\r\nmagnificent forests which have left so many interesting remains, and\r\nwhich accumulated the materials of our great beds of coal. In these the\r\nfamilies of the Club mosses, the Ferns and the Mare's-tails attained\r\nto a perfection in structure and size altogether unexampled in the\r\nmodern world, and may be said to have overspread the earth almost to\r\nthe exclusion of other trees. Here, however, two new families come in\r\nof higher grade, and leading the way to the flowering plants. These are\r\nthe Pines and their allies and the Cycads, and certain intermediate\r\nforms, neither Pines nor Cycads, but allied to both.[85] This wonderful\r\nflora, which we have now the materials to reproduce in imagination\r\nalmost in its entirety, decays and passes away in the Permian system,\r\nthe last portion of the Palæozoic, and in entering into the third great\r\nperiod of the earth's history--the Mesozoic, we again find an almost\r\nentire change of vegetation. Here, however, we are able to understand\r\nsomething of the reasons of this. The Palæozoic floras seem to have\r\noriginated in the North, and propagated themselves southward till they\r\nreplenished the earth, and they were favoured by the existence at\r\nthat time of vast swampy flats extending over great areas of the yet\r\nimperfectly elaborated continents. The Mesozoic floras, on the other\r\nhand, seem to have been of Southern or equatorial origin, and to have\r\nfollowed up the older vegetation as it decayed and disappeared, or\r\nretreated in its old age to its northern home. There is, of course,\r\nmuch in all this that we do not understand, but the general fact seems\r\ncertain.\r\n\r\n[85] _Cordaites_, etc. As I have elsewhere shown, these are distinct\r\nsub-floras in the Lower, Middle and Upper Devonian, and in the Lower,\r\nMiddle and Upper Carboniferous and Permian, sufficiently different to\r\nallow these periods to be determined by the evidence of these fossil\r\nplants. Reports prepared for Geological Survey of Canada.\r\n\r\nThe early Mesozoic is altogether peculiar. It shows a vast predominance\r\nof Cycads, Pines and Ferns, to the exclusion both of the gigantic\r\nCryptogams of the Palæozoic and of the ordinary exogenous trees of the\r\nmodern time. It has a strange, weird aspect, and more resembles that of\r\nsome warm islands of the southern hemisphere at present, than anything\r\nelse known to us. It is as if the flora of some southern island had\r\nmigrated and invaded all parts of the world. The geographical and\r\nclimated conditions which permitted this must have been of a character\r\ndifferent from those both of earlier and later times.\r\n\r\nAs we approach to the termination of the Mesozoic, which, in regard\r\nto animal life, is the age of reptiles, a new and strange development\r\nmeets us. We find beds filled with leaves of broad-leaved plants\r\nsimilar to those of our modern woods, and in most cases apparently\r\nbelonging to the same genera with plants now living, and this new\r\ntype of vegetation persists to the present, though with marked\r\ndifferences of species in successive eras, as in the Middle and Upper\r\nCretaceous, and the Lower, Middle and Upper Kainozoic, or Tertiary.\r\nIt is noteworthy that while this new vegetation not only altogether\r\nsupersedes the great Cryptogamous forests of the Palæozoic, but\r\nreplaces the Cycads of the immediately preceding eras, the Pines retain\r\nall their prominence and grandeur, and even seem to excel in number of\r\nspecies, in breadth of dispersion, and in magnitude of growth their\r\nsuccessors in the present world.\r\n\r\nWhile in the latter Cretaceous and Early Tertiary, the northern\r\nhemisphere at least seems to have enjoyed an exceptionally warm\r\nclimate, the later Tertiary introduces that period of cold known as\r\nthe Glacial age. While there is no doubt that the intensity of this\r\nglaciation has been greatly exaggerated by extreme glacialists, and\r\nwhile it is certain that some vegetation, and this not altogether of\r\nArctic types, continued to exist throughout this period, even in the\r\nnow temperate regions of our continents, it is evident that a great\r\nreduction of the exuberance of the flora occurred by the removal of\r\nmany species, and that the present flora of the northern hemisphere is\r\ninferior in variety and magnificence to that of the Middle Tertiary,\r\njust as it is found that the Mammalian fauna of our continents has\r\nsince that time been reduced both in the number and magnitude of its\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nIf the reader has followed this general sketch, he will be prepared to\r\nappreciate some examples of a more detailed character relating to the\r\nfloras of different periods, and some discussions of general points\r\nrelating to the genesis and vicissitudes of the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe origination of the more important floras which have occupied\r\nthe northern hemisphere in geological times, not, as one might at\r\nfirst sight suppose, in the sunny climates of the South, but under\r\nthe arctic skies, is a fact long known or suspected. It is proved by\r\nthe occurrence of fossil plants in Greenland, in Spitzbergen, and in\r\nGrinnell Land, under circumstances which show that these were their\r\nprimal homes. The fact bristles with physical difficulties, yet is\r\nfertile of the most interesting theoretical deductions, to reach which\r\nwe may well be content to wade through some intricate questions. Though\r\nnot at all a new fact, its full significance seems only recently to\r\nhave dawned on the minds of geologists, and within recent years it\r\nhas produced a number of memoirs and addresses to learned societies,\r\nbesides many less formal notices.[86]\r\n\r\n[86] Saporata, \"Ancienne Vegetation Polaire\"; Hooker, Presidential\r\nAddress to Royal Society, 1878; Thistleton Dyer, \"Lecture on Plant\r\nDistribution \"; Mr. Starkie Gardner, Letters in _Nature_, 1878, etc.\r\nThe basis of most of these brochures is to be found in Heer's \"Flora\r\nFossilis Arctica.\"\r\n\r\nThe earliest suggestion on this subject known to the writer is that of\r\nmy old and dear friend, Professor Asa Gray, in 1867, with reference to\r\nthe probable northern source of the related floras of North America\r\nand Eastern Asia. With the aid of new facts disclosed by Heer and\r\nLesquereux, Gray returned to the subject in 1872, and more fully\r\ndeveloped this conclusion with reference to the Tertiary floras,[87]\r\nand still later he further discussed these questions in an able lecture\r\non \"Forest Geography and Archæology.\"[88] In this he puts the case so\r\nwell and tersely that I may quote the following sentences as a text for\r\nwhat follows:--\r\n\r\n[87] Address to American Association.\r\n\r\n[88] _American Journal of Science_, xvi., 1878.\r\n\r\n\"I can only say, at large, that the same species (of Tertiary fossil\r\nplants) have been found all round the world; that the richest and\r\nmost extensive finds are in Greenland; that they comprise most of\r\nthe sorts which I have spoken of, as American trees which once lived\r\nin Europe--Magnolias, Sassafras, Hickories, Gum-trees, our identical\r\nSouthern Cypress (for all we can see of difference), and especially\r\n_Sequoias_, not only the two which obviously answer to the two Big-trees\r\nnow peculiar to California, but several others; that they equally\r\ncomprise trees now peculiar to Japan and China--three kinds of\r\nGingko-trees, for instance, one of them not evidently distinguishable\r\nfrom the Japan species which alone survives; that we have evidence, not\r\nmerely of Pines and Maples, Poplars, Birches, Lindens, and whatever\r\nelse characterize the temperate-zone forests of our era, but also of\r\nparticular species of these, so like those of our own time and country,\r\nthat we may fairly reckon them as the ancestors of several of ours.\r\nLong genealogies always deal more or less in conjecture; but we appear\r\nto be within the limits of scientific inference when we announce that\r\nour existing temperate trees came from the north, and within the bounds\r\nof high probability when we claim not a few of them as the originals\r\nof present species. Remains of the same plants have been found fossil\r\nin our temperate region, as well as in Europe.\"\r\n\r\nBetween 1860 and 1870 the writer was engaged in working out all that\r\ncould be learned of the Devonian plants of Eastern America, the oldest\r\nknown flora of any richness, and which consists almost exclusively of\r\ngigantic, and to us grotesque, representatives of the Club mosses,\r\nFerns, and Mare's-tails, with some trees allied to the Cycads and\r\nPines. In this pursuit nearly all the more important localities were\r\nvisited, and access was had to the large collections of Professor Hall\r\nand Professor Newberry in New York and Ohio, as well as to those of\r\nthe Geological Survey of Canada, and to those made in the remarkable\r\nplant-bearing beds of St. John, New Brunswick, by Messrs. Matthew\r\nand Hartt. In the progress of these researches, which developed an\r\nunexpectedly rich assemblage of species, the northern origin of this\r\nold flora seemed to be established by its earlier culmination in the\r\nnorth-east, in connection with the growth of the American land to the\r\nsouthward, which took place after the great Upper Silurian subsidence,\r\nby elevations which began in the north, while those portions of the\r\ncontinent to the south-west still remained under the sea.\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1870, the labours of those ten years were brought before the\r\nRoyal Society of London, in the Bakerian Lecture of that year, and in a\r\nmemoir illustrating no less than one hundred and twenty-five species of\r\nplants older than the great Carboniferous system, these deductions were\r\nstated in connection with the conclusions of Hall, Logan, and Dana,\r\nas to the distributions of sediment along the north-east side of the\r\nAmerican continent, and the anticipation was hazarded that the oldest\r\nPalæozoic floras would be discovered to the north of Newfoundland.\r\nMention was also made of the apparent earlier and more copious birth of\r\nthe Devonian flora in America than in Europe, a fact which is itself\r\nconnected with the greater northward extension of this continent.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the memoir containing these results was not published by\r\nthe Royal Society, and its publication was secured in a less perfect\r\nform only in the reports of the Geological Survey of Canada. The part\r\nof the memoir relating to Canadian fossil plants, with a portion of the\r\ntheoretical deductions, was published in a report issued in 1871.[89]\r\nIn this report the following language was used:--\r\n\r\n[89] \"Fossil Plants of the Devonian and Upper Silurian Formations of\r\nCanada,\" pp. 92, twenty plates. Montreal, 1871.\r\n\r\n\"In Eastern America, from the Carboniferous period onward, the centre\r\nof plant distribution has been the Appalachian chain. From this the\r\nplants and sediments extended westward in times of elevation, and\r\nto this they receded in times of depression. But this centre was\r\nnon-existent before the Devonian period, and the centre of this must\r\nhave been to the north-east, whence the great mass of older Appalachian\r\nsediment was derived. In the Carboniferous period there was also an\r\neastward distribution from the Appalachians, and links of connection\r\nin the Atlantic bed between the floras of Europe and America. In the\r\nDevonian such connection can have been only far to the north-east. It\r\nis therefore in Newfoundland, Labrador, and Greenland that we are to\r\nlook for the oldest American flora, and in like manner on the border of\r\nthe old Scandinavian nucleus for that of Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Again, it must have been the wide extension of the sea of the\r\nCorniferous limestone that gave the last blow to the remaining flora of\r\nthe Lower Devonian: and the re-elevation in the middle of that epoch\r\nbrought in the Appalachian ridges as a new centre, and established\r\na connection with Europe which introduced the Upper Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous floras. Lastly, from the comparative richness of the\r\nlater Erian[90] flora in Eastern America, especially in the St. John\r\nbeds, it might be a fair inference that the north-eastern end of the\r\nAppalachian ridge was the original birthplace or centre of creation of\r\nwhat we may call the later Palæozoic flora, or a large part of that\r\nflora.\"\r\n\r\n[90] The term Erian is used as synonymous with Devonian, and probably\r\nshould be preferred to it, as pointing to the best development of this\r\nformation known, which is on the shores of Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nWhen my paper was written I had not seen the account published by the\r\nable Swiss palæobotanist Heer, of the remarkable Devonian flora of Bear\r\nIsland, near Spitzbergen.[91] From want of acquaintance with the older\r\nfloras of America and Western Europe, Heer fell into the unfortunate\r\nerror of regarding the Bear Island plants as Lower Carboniferous, a\r\nmistake which his great authority has tended to perpetuate, and which\r\nhas even led to the still graver error of some European geologists, who\r\ndo not hesitate to regard as Carboniferous the fossil plants of the\r\nAmerican deposits from the Hamilton to the Chemung groups inclusive,\r\nthough these belong to formations underlying the oldest Carboniferous,\r\nand characterized by animal remains of unquestioned Devonian age. In\r\n1872 I addressed a note to the Geological Society of London on the\r\nsubject of the so-called \"Ursa stage\" of Heer, showing that though it\r\ncontained some forms not known at so early a date in temperate Europe,\r\nit was clearly Devonian when tested by North American standards; but\r\nthat in this high latitude, in which, for reasons stated in the report\r\nabove referred to, I believed the Devonian plants to have originated,\r\nthere might be an intermixture of the two floras. But such a mixed\r\ngroup should in that latitude be referred to a lower horizon than if\r\nfound in temperate regions.\r\n\r\n[91] Trans. Swedish Academy, 1871, _Journal London Geological Society_,\r\nvol. xxvlii.\r\n\r\nBetween 1870 and 1873 my attention was turned to the two sub-floras\r\nintermediate between those of the Devonian and the coal formation, the\r\nfloras of the Lower Carboniferous (Sub-carboniferous of some American\r\ngeologists) and the Millstone Grit, and in a report upon these[92]\r\nsimilar deductions were expressed. It was stated that in Newfoundland\r\nand Northern Cape Breton the coal formation species come in at an\r\nearly part of that period, and as we proceed southward they belong to\r\nprogressively newer portions of the Carboniferous system. The same fact\r\nis observed in the coal beds of Scotland, as compared with those of\r\nEngland, and it indicates that the coal formation flora, like that of\r\nthe Devonian, spread itself from the north, and this accords with the\r\nsomewhat extensive occurrence of Lower Carboniferous rocks and fossils\r\nin the Parry Islands and elsewhere in the Arctic regions.[93]\r\n\r\n[92] \"Fossil Plants of Lower Carboniferous and Millstone Grit\r\nFormations of Canada,\" pp. 47, 10 plates. Montreal, 1873.\r\n\r\n[93] G. M. Dawson, \"Report on Arctic Regions of Canada.\"\r\n\r\nPassing over the comparatively poor flora of the earlier Mesozoic,\r\nconsisting largely of cycads, pines, and ferns, which, as we have\r\nseen, is probably of southern origin, and is as yet little known in\r\nthe arctic, though represented, according to Heer, by the supposed\r\nJurassic flora of Cape Boheman, we find, especially at Komé and Atané\r\nin Greenland, an interesting occurrence of those earliest precursors\r\nof the truly modern forms of plants which appear in the Cretaceous,\r\nthe period of the English chalk, and of the New Jersey greensands.\r\nThere are two plant groups of this age in Greenland, one, that of\r\nKomé consists almost entirely of ferns, cycads, and pines, and is\r\nof decidedly Mesozoic aspect. This was regarded by Heer as Lower\r\nCretaceous. The other, that of Atané, holds remains of many modern\r\ntemperate genera, as _Populus_, _Myrica_, _Ficus_, _Sassafras_, and\r\n_Magnolia_. This he regards as Middle Cretaceous. Above this is\r\nthe Patoot series, with many exogenous trees of modern genera, and\r\nrepresenting the Upper Cretaceous. Resting upon these Upper Cretaceous\r\nbeds, without the intervention of any other formation,[94] are beds\r\nrich in plants of much more modern appearance, and referred by Heer\r\nto the Miocene period, a reference which appeared at the time to be\r\nwarranted by comparison with the Tertiary plants of Europe, but, as\r\nwe shall see, not with those of America. Still farther north this\r\nso-called Miocene assemblage of plants appears in Spitzbergen and\r\nGrinnell Land; but there, owing to the predominance of trees allied\r\nto the spruces, it has a decidedly more boreal character than in\r\nGreenland, as might be anticipated from its nearer approach to the\r\npole.[95]\r\n\r\n[94] Nordenskiöld, Expedition to Greenland, _Geological Magazine_, 1872.\r\n\r\n[95] Yet even here the Bald Cypress (_Taxodium distichum_), or a tree\r\nnearly allied to it, is found, though this species is now limited to\r\nthe Southern States. Fielden and De Ranee, _Journal of Geological\r\nSociety_, 1878.\r\n\r\nIf now we turn to the Cretaceous and Tertiary floras of Western\r\nAmerica, as described by Lesquereux, Newberry, and Ward, we find in\r\nthe lowest Cretaceous rocks known there until very recently--those\r\nof the Dakota group, which may be in the lower part of the Middle\r\nCretaceous--a series of plants[96] essentially similar to those of\r\nthe Middle Cretaceous of Greenland. To these I have been able to add,\r\nthrough the researches of Mr. Richardson and Dr. G. M. Dawson, a\r\nstill earlier flora, that of the Kootanie and Queen Charlotte Island\r\nformations, as old as the Gault and Wealden. It wants the broad-leaved\r\nplants of the Dakota, and consists mainly of pines, cycads, and\r\nferns; and only in its upper part contains a few forerunners of\r\nthe exogens.[97] These plants occur in beds indicating shallow sea\r\nconditions as prevalent in the interior of America, causing, no\r\ndoubt, a warm climate in the north. Overlying this plant-bearing\r\nformation we have an oceanic limestone (the Niobrara), corresponding\r\nin many respects to the European chalk, and containing similar\r\nmicroscopic organisms. This extends far north into the British\r\nterritory,[98] indicating farther subsidence and the prevalence of a\r\nvast Mediterranean Sea, filled with warm water from the equatorial\r\ncurrents, and not invaded by cold waters from the north. This is\r\nsucceeded by Upper Cretaceous deposits of clay and sandstone, with\r\nmarine remains, though very sparsely distributed; and these show that\r\nfurther subsidence or denudation in the north had opened a way for the\r\narctic currents, producing a fall of temperature at the close of the\r\nCretaceous, and partially filling up the Mediterranean of that period.\r\n\r\n[96] Lesquereux, Report on Cretaceous Flora. The reader not interested\r\nin American details may pass over to the middle of page 213.\r\n\r\n[97] This flora has since been described in Virginia and Maryland by\r\nFontaine, and has been recognised in Montana by Newberry.\r\n\r\n[98] G. M. Dawson, Report on Forty-ninth Parallel.\r\n\r\nOf the flora of the Middle and Upper Cretaceous periods, which must\r\nhave been very long, we know something in the interior regions through\r\nthe plants of Dunvegan and Peace River;[99] and on the coast of British\r\nColumbia we have the remarkable Cretaceous coal field of Vancouver's\r\nIsland, which holds the remains of plants of modern genera, including\r\nspecies of fan palm, ginkgo, evergreen oak, tulip tree, and other forms\r\nproper to a warm temperature or subtropical climate. They probably\r\nindicate a warmer climate as then prevalent on the Pacific coast\r\nthan in the interior, and in this respect correspond with a meagre\r\ntransition flora, intermediate between the Cretaceous and Eocene or\r\nearliest Tertiary of the interior regions, and named by Lesquereux the\r\nLower Lignitic.\r\n\r\n[99] _Trans. Royal Society of Canada._\r\n\r\nImmediately above these Upper Cretaceous beds we have the great\r\nLignite Tertiary of the west--the Laramie group of recent American\r\nreports[100]--abounding in fossil plants, proper to a temperate\r\nclimate, at one time regarded as Miocene, but now known to be Lower\r\nEocene.[101] These beds, with their characteristic plants, have been\r\ntraced into the British territory north of the forty-ninth parallel,\r\nand it has been shown that their fossils are identical with those of\r\nthe McKenzie River Valley, described by Heer as Miocene, and probably\r\nalso with those of Alaska, referred to the same age.[102] Now this\r\ntruly Eocene flora of the temperate and northern parts of America has\r\nso many species in common with that called Miocene in Greenland, that\r\nits identity can scarcely be doubted. These facts have led me to doubt\r\nthe Miocene age of the upper plant-bearing beds of Greenland, and more\r\nrecently Mr. J. Starkie Gardner has shown from comparison with the\r\nEocene flora of England and other considerations, that they are really\r\nof that earlier date.[103]\r\n\r\n[100] Ward, Repts. and Bulletins Am. Geol. Survey.\r\n\r\n[101] Lesquereux's Tertiary Flora; White and Ward on the Laramie Group;\r\nStevenson, Geological Relations of Lignitic Groups, _Am. Phil. Soc._,\r\nJune, 1875.\r\n\r\n[102] G. M. Dawson, Report on the Geology of the Forty-ninth Parallel,\r\n1875, where full details on these points may be found.\r\n\r\n[103] _Nature_, Dec. 12th, 1878; Publications Palæontographical\r\nSociety; Reports to British Association. It seems certain that the\r\nso-called Miocene of Bovey Tracey in Devon, and of Mull in Scotland, is\r\nreally Eocene. The Tertiary plant-bearing beds of Greenland are said by\r\nNathorst to rest unconformably on the Cretaceous, and are characterized\r\nby _M'Clintockia_ and other forms known in the Eocene of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland.\r\n\r\nIn looking at these details, we might perhaps suppose that no\r\nconditions of climate could permit the vegetation of the neighbourhood\r\nof Disco in Greenland to be identical with that of Colorado and\r\nMissouri, at a time when little difference of level existed in the two\r\nregions. Either the southern flora migrated north in consequence of a\r\ngreater amelioration of climate, or the northern flora moved southward\r\nas the climate became colder. The same argument, as Gardner has ably\r\nshown, applies to the similarity of the Tertiary plants of temperate\r\nEurope to those of Greenland. If Greenland required a temperature of\r\nabout 50°, as Heer calculates, to maintain its \"Miocene\" flora, the\r\ntemperature of England must have been at least 70°, and that of the\r\nsouth-western States still warmer. It is to be observed, however, that\r\nthe geographical arrangements of the American land in Cretaceous and\r\nearly Eocene times, included the existence of a great inland sea of\r\nwarm water extending at some periods as far north as the latitude of\r\n55°, and that this must have tended to much equality of climatical\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nWe cannot certainly affirm anything respecting the origin and\r\nmigrations of these floras, but there are some probabilities which\r\ndeserve attention. The ferns and cycads of the so-called Lower\r\nCretaceous of Greenland are nothing but a continuation of the previous\r\nJurassic flora. Now this was established at an equally early date in\r\nthe Queen Charlotte Islands,[104] and still earlier in Virginia.[105]\r\nThe presumption is, therefore, that it came from the south. It has\r\nindeed the facies of a southern hemisphere and insular flora; and\r\nprobably spread itself northward as far as Greenland at a time when\r\nthe American land was long, narrow, and warm, and when the ocean\r\ncurrents were carrying tepid water far toward the arctic regions. The\r\nflora which succeeds this in the sections at Atané and Patoot has no\r\nspecial affinities with the southern hemisphere, and is of a warm\r\ntemperate and continental character. It is very similar in its general\r\naspect to that of the Dakota group farther to the south, and this is\r\nprobably Middle Cretaceous. This flora must have originated either\r\nsomewhere in temperate America, or within the arctic circle, and it\r\nmust have replaced the older one by virtue of increasing subsidence\r\nand gradual change of climate. It must therefore have been connected\r\nwith the depression of the land which took place in the course of the\r\nCretaceous. During this movement it spread over all Western America,\r\nand as the land again arose from the sea of the Niobrara chalk, it\r\nassumed an aspect more suited to a cool climate, or moved southward,\r\nand finally abandoned the Arctic regions, perhaps continuing to exist\r\non the Pacific coast, and in sheltered places in the north, till the\r\nwarm inland seas of the Upper Cretaceous had given place to the wide\r\nplains and land-locked brackish seas or fresh-water lakes of the\r\nLaramie period (Eocene). Thus the true Upper Cretaceous marks in the\r\ninterior a cooler period intervening between the Middle Cretaceous and\r\nthe Lower Eocene floras of Greenland.\r\n\r\n[104] Reports Geological Survey of Canada.\r\n\r\n[105] Fontaine has well described the Mesozoic flora of Virginia,\r\n_American Journal of Science_, January, 1879.\r\n\r\nThis latter established itself in Greenland, and probably all around\r\nthe Arctic circle, in the mild period of the earliest Eocene, and\r\nas the climate of the northern hemisphere became gradually reduced\r\nfrom that time till the end of the Pliocene, it marched on over both\r\ncontinents to the southward, chased behind by the modern arctic flora,\r\nand eventually by the frost and snow of the Glacial age. This history\r\nmay admit of correction in details; but, so far as present knowledge\r\nextends, it is in the main not far from the truth.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the first great question which it raises is that as to the\r\ncauses of the alternations of warm and cold climates in the north,\r\napparently demanded by the vicissitudes of the vegetable kingdom. Here\r\nwe may set aside the idea that in former times plants were suited to\r\nendure greater cold than at present. It is true that some of the fossil\r\nGreenland plants are of unknown genera, and many are new species to us;\r\nbut we are on the whole safe in affirming that they must have required\r\nconditions similar to those necessary to their modern representatives,\r\nexcept within such limits as we now find to hold in similar cases among\r\nexisting plants. Still we know that at the present time many species\r\nfound in the equable climate of England will not live in Canada,\r\nthough species to all appearance similar in structure are natives of\r\nthe latter. There is also some reason to suppose that species, when\r\nnew, may have greater hardiness and adaptability than when in old age,\r\nand verging toward extinction. In any case, these facts can account\r\nfor but a small part of the phenomena, which require to be explained\r\nby physical changes affecting the earth as a whole, or at least the\r\nnorthern hemisphere. Many theoretical views have been suggested on this\r\nsubject, which will be found discussed elsewhere, and perhaps the most\r\npractical way to deal with them here will be to refer to the actual\r\nconditions known to have prevailed in connection with the introduction\r\nand distribution of the principal floras which have succeeded each\r\nother in geological history.\r\n\r\nIf we can assume that all the carbon now sealed up in limestones and in\r\ncoal was originally floating in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide, then\r\nwe would have a cause which might seriously have affected the earlier\r\nland floras--that, for instance, which may have existed in the Eozoic\r\nage, and those well known to us in the Palæozoic. Such an excess of\r\ncarbonic acid would have required some difference of constitution in\r\nthe plants themselves; it would have afforded them a super-abundance\r\nof wood-forming nutriment, and it would have acted as an obstacle to\r\nthe radiation of heat from the earth, almost equal to the glass roof\r\nof a greenhouse, thus constituting a great corrective of changes of\r\ntemperature. Under such circumstances we might expect a peculiar and\r\nexuberant vegetation in the earlier geological ages, though this would\r\nnot apply to the later in any appreciable degree. In addition to this\r\nwe know that the geographical arrangements of our continents were\r\nsuited to the production of a great uniformity of climate. Taking the\r\nAmerican continent as the simpler, we know that in this period there\r\nexisted in the interior plateau between the rudimentary eastern and\r\nwestern mountains a great inland sea, so sheltered from the north\r\nthat its waters contained hundreds of species of corals, growing with\r\na luxuriance unsurpassed in the modern tropics. On the shores and\r\nislands of such a sea we do not wonder that there should have been\r\ntree-ferns and gigantic lycopods. In the succeeding Carboniferous,\r\nvast areas, both on the margins and in the interior of the continent,\r\nwere occupied with swampy flats and lagoons, the atmosphere of which\r\nmust have been loaded with vapour, and rich in compounds of carbon,\r\nthough the temperature may have been lower than in the Devonian. There\r\nstill remained, however, more especially in the west, a remnant of\r\nthe old inland sea, which must have greatly aided in carrying a warm\r\ntemperature to the north.\r\n\r\nIf now we pass to the succeeding Jurassic age, we find a more meagre\r\nand less widely distributed flora, corresponding to less favourable\r\ngeographical and climatal conditions, while in the Cretaceous and\r\nEocene ages a return to the old condition of a warm Mediterranean in\r\ncontinuation of the Gulf of Mexico gave those facilities for vegetable\r\ngrowth, which carried plants of the temperate zone as far north as\r\nGreenland.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that those changes of physical geography and of the\r\nocean currents to which reference is so often made in these papers,\r\napply to the question of the distribution of plants in geological time.\r\n\r\nThese same causes may help us to deal with the peculiarities of the\r\ngreat Glacial age, which may have been rendered exceptionally severe\r\nby the combination of several of the continental and oceanic causes of\r\nrefrigeration. We must not imagine, however, that the views of those\r\nextreme glacialists, who suppose continental ice caps reaching half way\r\nto the equator, are borne out by facts. In truth, the ice accumulating\r\nround the pole must have been surrounded by water, and there must\r\nhave been tree-clad islands in the midst of the icy seas, even in the\r\ntime of greatest refrigeration. This is proved by the fact that in\r\nthe lower Leda clay of Eastern Canada, which belongs to the time of\r\ngreatest submergence, and whose fossil shells show sea water almost at\r\nthe freezing point, there are leaves of poplars and other plants which\r\nmust have been drifted from neighbouring shores. Similar remains occur\r\nin clays of similar origin in the basin of the great lakes and in the\r\nWest, and are not Arctic plants, but members of the North Temperate\r\nflora.[106] These have been called \"interglacial,\" but there is no\r\nevidence to prove that they are not truly glacial. Thus, while the\r\narctic flora must have continued to exist within the Arctic circle in\r\nthe Glacial age, we have evidence that those of the cold temperate and\r\nsubarctic zones continued to exist pretty far north. At the same time\r\nthe warm temperate flora would be driven to the south, except where\r\nsustained in insular spots warmed by the equatorial currents. It would\r\nreturn northward on the re-elevation of the land and the return of\r\nwarmth.\r\n\r\n[106] Pleistocene Plants of Canada, Dawson and Penhallow, _Bull, Geol.\r\nSocy._, America, 1890. In Europe the Arctic flora extended, relatively\r\nto present climate, farther south.\r\n\r\nIf, however, our modern flora is thus one that has returned from the\r\nsouth, this would account for its poverty in species as compared with\r\nthose of the early Tertiary. Groups of plants descending from the north\r\nhave been rich and varied. Returning from the south they are like the\r\nshattered remains of a beaten army. This, at least, has been the case\r\nwith such retreating floras as those of the Lower Carboniferous, the\r\nPermian, and the Jurassic, and possibly that of the Lower Eocene of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe question of the supply of light to an Arctic flora is much less\r\ndifficult than some have imagined. The long summer day is in this\r\nrespect a good substitute for a longer season of growth, while a\r\ncopious covering of winter snow not only protects evergreen plants from\r\nthose sudden alternations of temperature which are more destructive\r\nthan intense frost, and prevents the frost from penetrating to their\r\nroots, but by the ammonia which it absorbs preserves their greenness.\r\nAccording to Dr. Brown, the Danish ladies of Disco long ago solved\r\nthis problem.[107] He informs us that they cultivate in their houses\r\nmost of our garden flowers, as roses, fuchsias, and geraniums, showing\r\nthat it is merely warmth, and not light that is required to enable a\r\nsubtropical flora to thrive in Greenland. Even in Canada, which has a\r\nflora richer in some respects than that of temperate Europe, growth is\r\neffectually arrested by cold for nearly six months, and though there is\r\nample sunlight there is no vegetation. It is indeed not impossible that\r\nin the plans of the Creator the continuous summer sun of the Arctic\r\nregions may have been made the means for the introduction, or at least\r\nfor the rapid growth and multiplication, of new and more varied types\r\nof plants. It is a matter of familiar observation in Canada that our\r\nhardy garden flowers attain to a greater luxuriance and intensity of\r\ncolour in those more northern latitudes where they have the advantage\r\nof long and sunny summer days.\r\n\r\n[107] _Florula Discoana_, Botanical Society of Edinburgh, 1868.\r\n\r\nMuch, of course, remains to be known of the history of the old floras\r\nwhose fortunes I have endeavoured to sketch, and which seem to have\r\nbeen driven like shuttlecocks from north to south, and from south to\r\nnorth, especially on the American continent, whose meridional extension\r\nseems to have given a field specially suited for such operations.\r\n\r\nThis great stretch of the western continent from north to south is also\r\nconnected with the interesting fact that, when new floras are entering\r\nfrom the Arctic regions, they appear earlier in America than in Europe;\r\nand that in times when the old floras are retreating from the south,\r\nold genera and species linger longer in America. Thus, in the Devonian\r\nand Cretaceous new forms of those periods appear in America long before\r\nthey are recognised in Europe, and in the modern epoch forms that\r\nwould be regarded in Europe as Miocene still exist. Much confusion in\r\nreasoning as to the geological ages of the fossil flora has arisen from\r\nwant of attention to this circumstance.\r\n\r\nWhat we have learned respecting this wonderful history has served\r\nstrangely to change some of our preconceived ideas. We must now be\r\nprepared to admit that an Eden might exist even in Spitsbergen, that\r\nthere are possibilities in this old earth of ours which its present\r\ncondition does not reveal to us; that the present state of the world is\r\nby no means the best possible in relation to climate and vegetation;\r\nthat there have been and might be again conditions which could convert\r\nthe ice-clad Arctic regions into blooming paradises, and which, at\r\nthe same time, would moderate the fervent heat of the tropics. We are\r\naccustomed to say that nothing is impossible with God; but how little\r\nhave we known of the gigantic possibilities which lie hidden under some\r\nof the most common of His natural laws.\r\n\r\nYet these facts have been made the occasion of speculations as to\r\nthe spontaneous development of plants without any direct creative\r\nintervention. It would, from this point of view, be a nice question\r\nto calculate how many revolutions of climate would suffice to evolve\r\nthe first land plant; what are the chances that such plant would be so\r\ndealt with by physical changes as to be preserved and nursed into a\r\nmeagre flora like that of the Upper Silurian or the Jurassic; how many\r\ntransportations to Greenland would suffice to promote such meagre flora\r\ninto the rich and abundant forests of the Upper Cretaceous, and to\r\npeople the earth with the exuberant vegetation of the early Tertiary.\r\nSuch problems we may never be able to solve. Probably they admit of no\r\nsolution, unless we invoke the action of a creative mind, operating\r\nthrough long ages, and correlating with boundless power and wisdom\r\nall the energies inherent in inorganic and organic nature. Even then\r\nwe shall perhaps be able to comprehend only the means by which, after\r\nspecific types have been created, they may, by the culture of their\r\nMaker, be \"sported\" into new varieties or sub-species, and thus fitted\r\nto exist under different conditions, or to occupy higher places in the\r\neconomy of nature.\r\n\r\nBefore venturing on such extreme speculations as some now current on\r\nquestions of this kind, we would require to know the successive extinct\r\nfloras as perfectly as those of the modern world, and to be able to\r\nascertain to what extent each species can change, either spontaneously\r\nor under the influence of struggle for existence, or expansion under\r\nfavourable conditions, and under Arctic semi-annual days and nights, or\r\nthe shorter days of the tropics. Such knowledge, if ever acquired, it\r\nmay take ages of investigation to accumulate. In any case the subject\r\nof this paper indicates one hopeful line of study with the object of\r\narriving at some comprehension of the laws of creation.\r\n\r\nWhile the facts above slightly sketched impress us with the grand\r\nprogress of the vegetable kingdom in geological time, they equally show\r\nthe persistence of vegetable forms as compared with that of the dead\r\ncontinental masses and the decay of some forms of life in favour of the\r\nintroduction of others.\r\n\r\nWhen we find in the glacial beds the leaves of trees still living in\r\nNorth America and Europe, and consider the vicissitudes of elevation\r\nand submergence of the land, and of Arctic and temperate climates\r\nwhich have occurred, we are struck with the persistence of the weak\r\nthings of life, as compared with the changeableness of rocks and\r\nmountains. A superficial observer might think the fern or the moss\r\nof a granite hill a frail and temporary thing as compared with solid\r\nand apparently everlasting rock. But just the reverse is the case.\r\nThe plant is usually older than the mountain. But the glacial age\r\nis a very recent thing. We have facts older than this. As hinted in\r\na previous paper, in the Laramie clays associated with the Lignite\r\nbeds of North-western Canada--beds of Lower Eocene or early Tertiary\r\nage--which were deposited before the Rocky Mountains or the Himalayas\r\nhad reared their great peaks and ridges, and at a time when the whole\r\ngeography of the northern hemisphere was different from what it is\r\nat present--are remains of very frail and delicate plants which still\r\nlive. I have shown that in these clays there exist, side by side, the\r\nSensitive Fern, _Onoclea sensibilis_, and one of the delicate rock\r\nferns, _Davallia tenuifolia_.[108] The first is still very abundant\r\nall over North America. The second has ceased to exist in North\r\nAmerica, but still survives in the valleys of the Himalayas. These two\r\nlittle plants, once probably very widely diffused over the northern\r\nhemisphere, have continued to exist through the millenniums separating\r\nthe Cretaceous from the present time, and in which the greater part\r\nof our continent was again and again under the sea, in which great\r\nmountain chains have been rolled up and sculptured into their present\r\nforms, and in which giant forms, both of animal and plant life, have\r\nbegun, culminated and passed away. Truly God hath chosen the weak\r\nthings of the world to confound those that are strong.\r\n\r\n[108] Report on 49th Parallel, 1875.\r\n\r\nOther plants equally illustrate the decadence of important types of\r\nvegetable life. In the beautiful family of the Magnolias there exists\r\nin America a most remarkable and elegant tree, whose trunk attains\r\nsometimes a diameter of 7 feet and a height of 80 or 90 feet. Its\r\nbroad deep green leaves are singularly truncate at the end, as if\r\nartificially cut off, and in spring it puts forth a wealth of large and\r\nbrilliant orange and yellow flowers, from which it obtains the name of\r\nTulip tree. It is the _Liriodendron tulipifera_ of botanists, and the\r\nsole species of its genus. This Tulip tree has a history. All through\r\nthe Tertiary beds we find leaves referable to the genus, and belonging\r\nnot to one species only, but to several, and as we go back into the\r\nCretaceous, the species seem to become more numerous. Many of them\r\nhave smaller leaves than the modern species, others larger, and some\r\nhave forms even more quaint than that of the existing Tulip tree. The\r\noldest that I have seen in Canada is one from the Upper Cretaceous of\r\nPort McNeil in the north of Vancouver Island, which is as large as that\r\nof the modern species, and very similar in form. Thus this beautiful\r\nvegetable type culminated long geological ages ago, and was represented\r\nby many species, no doubt occupying a prominent place in the forests of\r\nthe northern hemisphere. To-day only a single species exists, in our\r\nwarmer regions, to keep up the memory of this almost perished genus;\r\nbut that species is one of our most beautiful trees.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Sequoias or giant Cypresses, of which two species\r\nnow exist in limited areas in California, is still more striking.\r\nThese giant trees, monsters of the vegetable kingdom, are, strange to\r\nsay, very limited in their geographical range. The greater of the two,\r\n_Sequoia gigantea_, the giant tree _par excellence_, seems limited to a\r\nfew groves in California. At first sight this strikes us as anomalous,\r\nespecially as we find that the tree will grow somewhat widely both\r\nin Europe and America when its seeds are sown in suitable soil. The\r\nmystery is solved when we learn that the two existing species are but\r\nsurvivors of a genus once diffused over the whole northern hemisphere,\r\nand represented by many species, constituting, in the Later Cretaceous\r\nand Eocene ages, vast and dark forests extending over enormous areas\r\nof our continents, and forming much of the material of the thick and\r\nwidely distributed Lignite beds of North-western America. Thus the\r\ngenus has had its time of expansion and prevalence, and is now probably\r\nverging on extinction, not because there are not suitable habitats, but\r\neither because it is now old and moribund, or because other and newer\r\nforms have now a preference in the existing conditions of existence.\r\n\r\nThe Plane trees, the Sassafras, the curious Ginkgo tree or fern-leaved\r\nyew of Japan, are cases of similar decadence of genera once represented\r\nby many species, while other trees, like the Willows and Poplars, the\r\nMaples, the Birches, the Oaks and the Pines, though of old date, are\r\nstill as abundant as they ever were, and some genera would seem even\r\nto have increased in number of species, though on the whole the flora\r\nof our modern woods is much less rich than those of the Miocene and\r\nEocene, or even than that of the Later Cretaceous. The early Tertiary\r\nperiods were, as we know, times of exuberant and gigantic animal life\r\non the land, and it is in connection with this that the vegetable\r\nworld seems to have attained its greatest variety and luxuriance. Even\r\nthat early post-glacial age in which primitive man seems first to have\r\nspread himself over our continents was one richer both in animal and\r\nplant life than the present. The geographical changes which closed\r\nthis period and inaugurated the modern era seem to have reduced not\r\nonly the area of the continents but the variety of land life in a very\r\nremarkable manner. Thus our last lesson from the genesis and migrations\r\nof plants is the humbling one that the present world is by no means the\r\nbest possible in so far as richness of vegetable and animal life is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the utility of fossil plants as evidence\r\nof climate; but the subject deserves more detailed notice. I have\r\noften pondered on the nature of the climate evidenced by the floras of\r\nthe Devonian and Carboniferous; but the problem is a difficult one,\r\nnot only because of the peculiar character of the plants themselves,\r\nso unlike those of our time, but because of the probably different\r\nmeteorological conditions of the period. It is easy to see that a\r\nflora of tree-ferns, great lycopods and pines is more akin to that of\r\noceanic islands in warm latitudes than anything else that we know.\r\nBut the Devonian and Carboniferous plants did not flourish in oceanic\r\nislands, but for the most part on continental areas of considerable\r\ndimensions, though probably more flat and less elevated than those\r\nof the present day. They also grew, from Arctic latitudes, almost,\r\nif not altogether, to the equator; and though there are generic\r\ndifferences in the plants of these periods in the southern hemisphere,\r\nyet these do not affect the general facies. There are, for example,\r\ncharacteristic Lepidodendroids in the Devonian and Carboniferous of\r\nBrazil, Australia, and South Africa. If now we consider the plants a\r\nlittle more in detail, coniferous and taxine trees grow now in very\r\ndifferent latitudes and climates. There is therefore nothing so very\r\nremarkable in their occurrence. The great group of Cordaites may have\r\nbeen equally hardy; but it is noteworthy that their geographical\r\ndistribution is more limited. In Europe, for example, they are more\r\ncharacteristic in France than in Great Britain. Ferns and Lycopods and\r\nMare's-tails are also cosmopolitan, but the larger species belong to\r\nthe warmer climates, and nowhere at present do they become so woody and\r\nso complex in structure as they were in the older geological periods.\r\nAt the present day, however, they love moisture rather than aridity,\r\nand uniformity of temperature rather than extreme light and heat. The\r\nnatural inference would be that in these older periods geographical\r\nand other conditions must have conspired to produce a uniform and\r\nmoist climate over a large portion of the continents. The geographical\r\nconditions of the Carboniferous age, and the distribution of animal\r\nlife on the sea and land, confirm the conclusion based on the flora.\r\nFurther, if, as seems probable, there was a larger proportion of carbon\r\ndioxide in the atmosphere than at present, this would not only directly\r\naffect the growth of plants, but would impede radiation, and so prevent\r\nescape of heat by that means, while the moisture exhaled from inland\r\nseas and lagoons and vastly extended swamps, would tend in the same\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be a mistake to infer that there were not local\r\ndifferences of climate. I have elsewhere[109] advocated the theory\r\nthat the great ridge of boulders, the New Glasgow conglomerate, which\r\nforms one margin of the coal field of Picton, in Nova Scotia, is an\r\nice-formed ridge separating the area of accumulation of the great\r\nthirty-six feet seam from an outer area in which aqueous conditions\r\nprevailed, and little coal was formed. In this case, an ice-laden\r\nsea, carrying boulders on its floes and fields of ice, must have been\r\na few miles distant from forests of Lepidodendra, Cordaites, and\r\nSigillariæ, and the climate must have been anything but warm, at least\r\nat certain seasons. Nor have we a right to infer that the growth of\r\nthe coal-plants was rapid. Stems, with woody axes and a thick bark,\r\ncontaining much fibrous and thick-walled cellular tissue, are not to\r\nbe compared with modern succulent plants, especially when we consider\r\nthe sparse and rigid foliage of many of them. Our conclusion should,\r\ntherefore, be that geographical conditions and the abundance of\r\ncarbon dioxide in the atmosphere favoured a moist climate and uniform\r\ntemperature, and that the flora was suited to these conditions.\r\n\r\n[109] \"Acadian Geology,\" Carboniferous of Picton.\r\n\r\nAs to the early Mesozoic flora, I have already suggested that it must\r\nhave been an invader from the south, for which the intervening Permian\r\nage had made way by destroying the Palæozoic flora. This was probably\r\neffected by great earth-movements changing geographical conditions.\r\nBut in the Mesozoic the old conditions to some extent returned, and\r\nthe Carboniferous plants being extinct, their places were taken by\r\npines, lycopods, and ferns, whose previous home had been in the insular\r\nregions of the tropics, and which, as climatal conditions improved,\r\npushed their way to the Arctic circle. But, being derivatives of warm\r\nregions, their vitality and capacity for variation were not great,\r\nand they only locally and in favourable conditions became great coal\r\nproducers. The new flora of the Later Cretaceous and the Tertiary, as\r\npreviously stated, originated in the Arctic, and marched southward.\r\n\r\nThese newer Cretaceous plants presented from the first the generic\r\naspects of modern vegetation, and so enable us much better to gauge\r\ntheir climatal conditions. In general, they do not indicate tropical\r\nheat in the far north, but only that of the warm temperate zone; but\r\nthis in some portions of the period certainly extends to the middle of\r\nGreenland, unless, without any evidence, we suppose that the Cretaceous\r\nand lower Tertiary plants differed in hardiness of constitution from\r\ntheir modern representatives. They prove, however, considerable\r\noscillations of climate. Gardner, Nathorst and Reid have shown this in\r\nEurope, and that it extends from the almost tropical flora of the lower\r\nEocene to the Arctic flora of the Pleistocene. In America, owing, as\r\nGrey has suggested, to its great north and south extension, the changes\r\nwere more regular and gradual. In the warmer periods of the Cretaceous,\r\nthe flora as far north as 55° was similar to that of Georgia and\r\nNorthern Florida at the present day, while in the cooler period of the\r\nLaramie (Lower Eocene, or more probably Paleocene) it was not unlike\r\nthat of the Middle States. In the Pleistocene, the flora indicates a\r\nboreal temperature in the Glacial age. Thus there are no very extreme\r\ncontrasts, but the evident fact of a warm temperate or subtropical\r\nclimate extending very far north at the same times when Greenland had\r\na temperate climate. As I have elsewhere shown,[110] discoveries in\r\nvarious parts of North America are beginning to indicate the precise\r\ngeographical conditions accompanying the warmer and colder climates.\r\n\r\n[110] Trans. Royal Society of Canada, 1890-1.\r\n\r\nIt would be wrong to leave this subject without noticing that\r\nremarkable feature in the southward movement of the later floras,\r\nto which I believe Prof. Gray was the first to direct attention. In\r\nthose periods when a warm climate prevailed in the Arctic regions,\r\nthe temperate flora must have been, like the modern Arctic flora,\r\ncircumpolar. When obliged to migrate to the south, it had to follow the\r\nlines of the continents, and so to divide into separate belts. Three of\r\nthese at present are the floras of Western Europe, Eastern Asia, and\r\nEastern America, all of which have many representative species. They\r\nare separated by oceans and by belts of land occupied by plants which\r\nhave not been obliged to migrate. Thus, while the flora of the Eastern\r\nUnited States resembles that of China and Japan, that of California\r\nand Oregon is distinct from both, and represents a belt of old species\r\nretained in place by the continued warmth of the Pacific shore, and the\r\ncontinuous extension of the American continent to the south affording\r\nthem means of retreat in the Glacial age. Were the plants of China\r\nand Eastern America enabled to return to the Arctic, they would then\r\nreunite into one flora. Gray compares the process of their separation\r\nto the kind of selection which might be made by a botanical distributor\r\nwho had the whole collection placed in his hands, with instructions\r\nto give one species of each genus to Europe, to Eastern Asia, and to\r\nEastern America; and if there was only one species in a genus, or if\r\none remained over, this was to be thrown into one of the regions, with\r\na certain preference in favour of America and Asia. This remarkable\r\nkind of geographical selection opens a wide field not only for thought,\r\nbut for experiment on the actual relationship of the representative\r\nspecies. There is a similar field for comparison between the trees\r\nof Georgia in latitude 30° to 35°, and the same species or their\r\nrepresentatives as they existed in Cretaceous times in the latitudes of\r\n50° and 60°. The two floras, as I know from actual comparison, are very\r\nsimilar.\r\n\r\nOne word may be said here as to use of fossil plants in determining\r\ngeological time. In this I need only point to the fact of my\r\nhaving defined in Canada three Devonian floras, a Lower, Middle,\r\nand Upper, and that Mr. Whiteaves, in his independent study of the\r\nfossil fishes, has vindicated my conclusions. There are also in Nova\r\nScotia three distinctive sub-floras of the Lower, Middle, and Upper\r\nCarboniferous.[111] I have verified these for the Devonian and\r\nCarboniferous of the United States, and to some extent also for those\r\nof Europe. To the same effect is the recognition of the Kootanie or\r\nLower Cretaceous, the Middle Cretaceous, Upper Cretaceous, Laramie and\r\nMiocene in Western Canada. These have in all cases corresponded with\r\nthe indications of animal fossils[112] and of stratigraphy. Fossil\r\nplants have been less studied in this connection than fossil animals,\r\nbut I have no hesitation in affirming that, with reference to the\r\nbroader changes of the earth's surface, any competent palæobotanist is\r\nperfectly safe in trusting to the evidence of vegetable fossils.\r\n\r\n[111] _Transactions Royal Society of Canada_, 1883 to 1891.\r\n\r\n[112] Reports on Fossil Plants of the Devonian and Lower Carboniferous.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that such evidence will be affected by the\r\nmigrations of plants, so that we cannot be certain that identical\r\nspecies flourished in Greenland and in temperate America at the same\r\ntime. If such species originated in Greenland and migrated southward,\r\nthe specimens found at the south may be much newer than those in the\r\nnorth. This, no doubt, is locally true, but the migrations of plants,\r\nthough slow, occupy less time than that of a great geological period.\r\nIt may also be objected that the flora of swamps, plains, and mountain\r\ntops would differ at any one period. This also is true, but the same\r\ndifficulty applies to animals of the deep sea, the shore, and the land;\r\nand these diversities of station have always to be taken into account\r\nby the palæontologist.\r\n\r\n  References:--Report on the Erian or Devonian Plants of Canada,\r\n    Montreal, 1871.

It came to pass in this\r\nway that the Carboniferous rocks were those which I first studied as an\r\nembryo geologist, and much of my later work has consisted in collecting\r\nand determining the plants of that ancient period, and in studying\r\nmicroscopic sections of coals and fossil woods accompanying them. For\r\nthis reason, and because I have published so much on this subject, my\r\nfirst decision was to leave it out of these Salient Points: but on\r\nsecond thoughts it seemed that this might be regarded as a dereliction\r\nof duty; more especially as some of the conclusions supposed to be the\r\nbest established on this subject have recently been called in question.\r\n\r\nHad I been writing a few years ago, I might have referred to the mode\r\nof formation of coal as one of the things most surely settled and\r\nunderstood. The labours of many eminent geologists, microscopists and\r\nchemists in the old and the new worlds had shown that coal nearly\r\nalways rests upon old soil-surfaces penetrated with roots, and that\r\ncoal beds have in their roofs erect trees, the remains of the last\r\nforests that grew upon them. Logan and the writer have illustrated\r\nthis in the case of the series of more than eighty successive coal\r\nbeds exposed at the South Joggins, and of the great thirty feet seam\r\nof the Picton coal series, whose innumerable laminæ have all been\r\nsubjected to careful scrutiny, and have shown unequivocal evidence of\r\nland surfaces accompanying the deposition of the coal. Microscopical\r\nexamination has proved that these coals are composed of the materials\r\nof the same trees whose roots are found in the underclays, and their\r\nstems and leaves in the roof shales; that much of the material of the\r\ncoal has been partially subjected to subaërial decay at the time of its\r\naccumulation; and that in this, ordinary coal differs from bituminous\r\nshale, earthy bitumen and some kinds of cannel, which have been formed\r\nunder water; that the matter remaining as coal consists almost entirely\r\nof epidermal tissues, which being suberose or corky in character are\r\nhighly carbonaceous, very durable and impermeable by water, and are,\r\nhence, the best fitted for the production of pure coal; and finally,\r\nthat the vegetation and the climatal and geographical features of\r\nthe coal period were eminently fitted to produce in the vast swamps\r\nof that period precisely the effects observed. All these points and\r\nmany others have been thoroughly worked out for both European and\r\nAmerican coal fields, and seemed to leave no doubt on the subject. But\r\nseveral years ago certain microscopists observed in slices of coal,\r\nthin layers full of spore cases, a not unusual circumstance, since\r\nthese were shed in vast abundance by the trees of the coal forests,\r\nand because they contain suberose matter of the same character with\r\nepidermal tissues generally. Immediately we were informed that all coal\r\nconsists of spores, and this being at once accepted by the unthinking,\r\nthe results of the labours of many years are thrown aside in favour of\r\nthis crude and partial theory. A little later, a German microscopist\r\nhas thought proper to describe coal as made up of minute algæ, and\r\ntries to reconcile this view with the appearances, devising at the same\r\ntime a new and formidable nomenclature of generic and specific names,\r\nwhich would seem largely to represent mere fragments of tissues.\r\nStill later, some local facts in a French coal field have induced an\r\neminent observer of that country to revive the drift theory of coal,\r\nin opposition to that of growth _in situ_. Views of this kind have\r\nalso recently been advanced in England by some of those younger men\r\nwho would earn distinction rather by overthrowing the work of their\r\nseniors than by building on it. These writers base their conclusions\r\non a few exceptional facts, as the occasional occurrence of seams of\r\ncoal without distinct underlays, and the occurrence of clay partings\r\nshowing aquatic conditions in the substance of thick coals; and they\r\nfail to discern the broader facts which these exceptions confirm. Let\r\nus consider shortly the essential nature of coal, and some of the\r\nconditions necessary to its formation.\r\n\r\nA block of the useful mineral which is so important an element in\r\nnational wealth, and so essential to the comfort of our winter homes,\r\nmay tell us much as to its history if properly interrogated, and what\r\nwe cannot learn from it alone we may be taught by studying it in the\r\nmine whence it is obtained, and in the cliffs and cuttings where the\r\nedges of the coaly beds and their accompaniments are exposed.\r\n\r\nOur block of coal, if anthracite, is almost pure carbon. If bituminous\r\ncoal, it contains also a certain amount of hydrogen, which in\r\ncombination with carbon enables it to yield gas and coal tar, and which\r\ncauses it to burn with flame. If, again, we examine some of the more\r\nimperfect and more recent coals, the brown coals, so called, we shall\r\nfind that in composition and texture they are intermediate between\r\ncoal proper and hardened or compressed peat. Now such coaly rocks can,\r\nunder the present constitution of nature, be produced only in one way,\r\nnamely, by the accumulation of vegetable matter, for vegetation alone\r\nhas the power of decomposing the carbonic acid of the atmosphere, and\r\naccumulating it as carbon. This we see in modern times in the vegetable\r\nsoil, in peaty beds, and in vegetable muck accumulated in ponds and\r\nsimilar places. Such vegetable matter, once accumulated, requires only\r\npressure and the changes which come of its own slow putrefaction to be\r\nconverted into coal.\r\n\r\nBut in order that it may accumulate at all, certain conditions are\r\nnecessary. The first of these includes the climatal and organic\r\narrangements necessary for abundant vegetable growth. The second is the\r\nfacility for the preservation of the vegetable matter, without decay or\r\nintermixture with earthy substances; and this, for a long time, till\r\na great thickness of it accumulates. The third is its covering up by\r\nother deposits, so as to be compressed and excluded from air. It is\r\nevident that when we have to consider the formation of a bed of coal\r\nseveral feet in thickness, and spread, perhaps, over hundreds of square\r\nmiles, many things must conduce to such a result, and the wonder is\r\nperhaps rather that such conditions should ever have been effectively\r\ncombined. Yet this has occurred at different periods of geological\r\nhistory and in many places, and in some localities it has been so\r\nrepeated as to produce many beds of coal in succession.\r\n\r\nLet us now question our block of coal as to its origin, supposing it\r\nto be a piece of ordinary bituminous coal, or still better, a specimen\r\nof one of the impure somewhat shaly coals which one sometimes finds\r\naccidentally in the coal bin. In looking at the edge of our specimen\r\nwe observe that it has a \"reed\" or grain, which corresponds with the\r\nlamination or bedding of the seam of coal from which it came. Looking\r\nat this carefully, we shall see that there are many thin layers of\r\nbright shining coal, and the more of these usually the better the\r\ncoal. These layers, in tracing them along, we observe often to thin\r\nout and disappear. They are not very continuous. If our specimen\r\nis an impure coal, we will find that it readily splits along the\r\nsurfaces of these layers, and that when so split, we can see that each\r\nlayer of shining coal has certain markings, perhaps the flattened\r\nribs and scars of Sigillaria or other coal-formation trees on its\r\nsurface. In other words, the layers of fine coal are usually flattened\r\ntrunks and branches of trees, or perhaps rather of the imperishable\r\nand impermeable bark of such trees, the wood having perished. A few\r\nvery thin layers of shining coal we may also find to consist of the\r\nlarge-ribbed leaves of the plant known as Cordaites. This kind of coaly\r\nmatter then usually represents trunks of trees which in a prostrate and\r\nflattened state may constitute more than half of the bulk of ordinary\r\ncoal-formation coal. Under the microscope this variety of coal shows\r\nlittle structure, and this usually the thickened cells of cortical\r\ntissue. Intervening between these layers we perceive lamina?, more\r\nor less thick and continuous, of what we may call dull coal, black\r\nbut not shining; resembling, in fact, the appearance of cannel coal.\r\nIf we split the coal along one side of these layers, and examine it\r\nin a strong light, we may see shreds of leaf stalks and occasionally\r\neven of fern leaves, or skeletons of these, showing the veins, and\r\nmany flattened disc-like bodies, spore cases and macrospores, shed by\r\nthe plants which make up the coal. These layers represent what may be\r\ncalled compressed vegetable mould or muck, and this is by no means a\r\nsmall constituent of many coals. This portion of the coal is the most\r\ncurious and interesting in microscopic slices, showing a great variety\r\nof tissues and many spores and spore cases. Lastly, we find on the\r\nsurface of the coal, when split parallel to the bedding, a quantity\r\nof soft shining fibrous material, known as mineral charcoal or mother\r\ncoal, which in some varieties of the mineral is very abundant, in\r\nothers much more rare. This is usually too soft and incoherent to be\r\npolished in thin slices for the microscope; but if boiled for a length\r\nof time in nitric acid, so as to separate all the mineral matter\r\ncontained in it, the fibres sometimes become beautifully translucent\r\nand reveal the tissues of the wood of various kinds of Carboniferous\r\ntrees, more especially of Calamites, Cordaites and Sigillariæ. Fibres\r\nof mineral charcoal prepared in this way are often very beautiful\r\nmicroscopic objects under high powers; and this material of the coal\r\nis nothing else than little blocks of rotten wood and fibrous bark,\r\nbroken up and scattered over the surface of the forming coal bed. All\r\nthese materials, it must be observed, have been so compressed that the\r\nfragments of decayed wood have been flattened into films, the vegetable\r\nmould consolidated into a stony mass, and trunks of great trees\r\nconverted by enormous pressure into laminæ of shining coal, a tenth of\r\nan inch in thickness, so that the whole material has been reduced to\r\nperhaps one-hundredth of its original volume.\r\n\r\nRestoring the mass in imagination to its original state, what do we\r\nfind? A congeries of prostate trunks with their interstices filled with\r\nvegetable muck or mould, and occasional surfaces where rotten wood,\r\ndisintegrated into fragments, was washed about in local floods or rain\r\nstorms, and thus thrown over the surface. Lyell seems very nearly to\r\nhave hit the mark when he regarded the conditions of the great dismal\r\nswamp of Virginia as representing those of a nascent coal field. We\r\nhave only to realize in the coal period the existence of a dense\r\nvegetation very different from that of modern Virginia, of a humid and\r\nmild climate, and of a vast extension of low swampy plains, to restore\r\nthe exact conditions of the coal swamps.\r\n\r\nBut how does this correspond with the facts observed in mines and\r\nsections? To the late Sir William Logan is due the merit of observing\r\nthat in South Wales the underclays or beds of indurated clay and earth\r\nunderlying the coal seams are usually filled with the long cylindrical\r\nrootlets and branching roots of a curious plant, very common in the\r\ncoal formation, the Stigmaria. He afterwards showed that the same fact\r\noccurs in the very numerous coal beds exposed in the fine section cut\r\nby the tides of the Bay of Fundy, in the coal rocks of Nova Scotia. In\r\nthat district I have myself followed up his observations, examining\r\nin detail every one of eighty-one Coal Groups, as I have called them,\r\neach consisting of at least one bed of coal, large or small, with\r\nits accompaniments, and in many cases of several small seams with\r\nintervening clays or shales.[113] In nearly every case the Stigmaria\r\n\"underclay\" is distinctly recognisable, and often in a single coal\r\ngroup there are several small seams separated by underclays with roots\r\nand rootlets. These underclays are veritable fossil soils; sometimes\r\nbleached clays or sands, like the subsoils of modern swamps; sometimes\r\nloamy or sandy, or of the nature of hardened vegetable mould. They\r\nrarely contain any remains of aquatic animals, or of animals of any\r\nkind, but are filled with stigmaria roots and rootlets, and sometimes\r\nhold a few prostrate stems of trees.[114] While the underclay is thus\r\na fossil soil, the roof or bed above the coal, usually of a shaly\r\ncharacter, is full of remains of leaves and stems and fruits, and often\r\nholds erect stumps, the remains of the last trees that grew in the\r\nswamp before it was finally covered up.\r\n\r\n[113] For details see _Journal Geol. Society of London_, 1865; and\r\n\"Acadian Geology,\" last edition, 1891.\r\n\r\n[114] At the South Joggins, in two or three cases, beds of bituminous\r\nshale full of Naiadites and Cyprids have by elevation and drying become\r\nfit for the growth of trees with stigmaria roots; but this is quite\r\nexceptional, no doubt arising from the accidental draining of lakes or\r\nlagoons on their elevation above the sea level.\r\n\r\nSome of the thinnest coals, and some beds so thin and impure that they\r\ncan scarcely be called coals at all, are the most instructive. Witness\r\nthe following from my section of the South Joggins.\r\n\r\nCoal Group 1, of Division 3, is the highest of the series. Its section\r\nis as follows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Grey argillaceous shale.\r\n   Coal, 1 inch.\r\n   Grey argillaceous underclay, Stigmaria.\r\n\r\n\"The roof holds abundance of fern leaves (_Alethopteris lonchitica_).\r\nThe coal is coarse and earthy, with much epidermal and bast tissue,\r\nspore cases, etc., vascular bundles of ferns and impressions of bark\r\nof Sigillaria and leaves of Cordaites. It may be considered as a\r\ncompressed vegetable soil resting on a subsoil full of rootlets of\r\nStigmaria.\" In this case the coal is an inch in thickness, but there\r\nare many beds where the coal is a mere film, and supports great\r\nerect stems of Sigillaria, sending downward their roots in the form\r\nof branching Stigmariæ into the underclay, thus proving that the\r\nStigmariæ of the underclays are the roots of the Sigillariæ of the\r\ncoals and their roofs.\r\n\r\nHere is another example which may be called a coal group, and is No. 11\r\nof the same division:\r\n\r\n  \"Grey argillaceous shale, erect Calamites.\r\n   Coal, 1 inch.\r\n   Grey argillaceous underclay, Stigmaria, 1 ft. 6 in.\r\n   Coal, 2 inches.\r\n   Grey argillaceous underclay, Stigmaria, 4 in.\r\n   Coal, 1 inch.\r\n   Grey argillaceous underclay, Stigmaria.\r\n\r\n\"This is an alternation of thin, coarse coals with fossil soils. The\r\nroof shale contains erect Calamites, which seem to have been the last\r\nvegetation which grew on the surface of the upper coal.\"\r\n\r\nSuch facts, with many minor varieties, extend through the whole\r\neighty-one coal groups of this remarkable section, as any one may see\r\nby referring to the paper and work cited in the preceding note. It\r\nis possibly because in most coal fields the smaller and commercially\r\nuseless beds are so little open to observation, that so crude ideas\r\nderived merely from imperfect access to the beds that are worked exist\r\namong geologists. The following summary of facts may perhaps serve to\r\nplace the evidence as to the mode of accumulation of coal fairly before\r\nthe reader:--\r\n\r\n(1) The occurrence of Stigmaria under nearly every bed of coal proves,\r\nbeyond question, that the material was accumulated by growth _in situ_,\r\nwhile the character of the sediments intervening between the beds of\r\ncoal proves with equal certainty the abundant transport of mud and sand\r\nby water. In other words, conditions similar to those of the swampy\r\ndeltas of great rivers, or the swampy flats of the interiors of great\r\ncontinents, are implied.\r\n\r\n(2) The true coal consists principally of the flattened bark of\r\nsigillaroid and other trees, intermixed with leaves of ferns and\r\n_Cordaites_, and other herbaceous _débris_, including vast numbers of\r\nspores and spore cases, and with fragments of decayed wood constituting\r\n\"mineral charcoal,\" all their materials having manifestly alike grown\r\nand accumulated where we find them.\r\n\r\n(3) The microscopical structure and chemical composition of the beds\r\nof cannel coal and earthy bitumen, and of the more highly bituminous\r\nand carbonaceous shales, show them to have been of the nature of the\r\nfine vegetable mud which accumulates in the ponds and shallow lakes\r\nof modern swamps. These beds are always distinct from true subaërial\r\ncoal. When such fine vegetable sediment is mixed, as is often the\r\ncase, with mud, it becomes similar to the bituminous limestone and\r\ncalcareo-bituminous shales of the coal measures.\r\n\r\n(4) A few of the underclays which support beds of coal are of the\r\nnature of the vegetable mud above referred to; but the greater part are\r\nargillo-arenaceous in composition, with little vegetable matter, and\r\nbleached by the drainage from them of water containing the products\r\nof vegetable decay. They are, in short, loamy or clay soils in the\r\nchemical condition in which we find such soils under modern bogs,\r\nand must have been sufficiently above water to admit of drainage.\r\nThe absence, or small quantity of sulphides, and the occurrence of\r\ncarbonate of iron in connection with them, prove that when they\r\nexisted as soils, rain water, and not sea water, percolated them.\r\n\r\n(5) The coal and the fossil trees present many evidences of subaërial\r\nconditions. Most of the erect and prostrate trees had become hollow\r\nshells of bark before they were finally imbedded, and their wood had\r\nbroken into cubical pieces of mineral charcoal. Land snails and galley\r\nworms (_Xylobius_) crept into them, and they became dens or traps for\r\nreptiles. Large quantities of mineral charcoal occur on the surfaces of\r\nall the larger beds of coal. None of these appearances could have been\r\nproduced by subaqueous action.\r\n\r\n(6) Though the roots of _Sigillaria_ bear some resemblance to the\r\nrhizomes of certain aquatic plants, yet structurally they have much\r\nresemblance to the roots of Cycads, which the stems also resemble.\r\nFurther, the _Sigillariæ_ grew on the same soils which supported\r\nconifers, _Lepidodendra_, _Cordaites_, and ferns, plants which could\r\nnot have grown in water. Again, with the exception, perhaps, of some\r\n_Pinnulariæ_ and _Asterophyllites_, and Rhizocarpean spores, there is\r\na remarkable absence from the coal measures of any form of properly\r\naquatic vegetation.\r\n\r\n(7) The occasional occurrence of marine or brackish-water animals in\r\nthe roofs of coal beds, or even in the coal itself, affords no evidence\r\nof subaqueous accumulation, since the same thing occurs in the case of\r\nmodern submarine forests. Such facts merely imply that portions of the\r\nareas of coal accumulation were liable to inundation of a character so\r\ntemporary as not finally to close the process, as happened when at last\r\na roof shale was deposited by water over the coal. Cannel coals and\r\nbituminous shales holding mussel-like shells, fish scales, etc., imply\r\nthe existence sometimes for long periods of ponds, lakes or lagoons\r\nin the coal swamps, but ordinary coal did not accumulate in these. It\r\nis in the cannels and similar subaqueous coals that the macrospores\r\nwhich I attribute in great part to aquatic plants, allied to modern\r\nSalvinia, etc., are chiefly found.[115]\r\n\r\n[115] \"Geological History of Plants,\" _Bulletin Chicago Academy of\r\nSciences_, 1886.\r\n\r\nFor these and other reasons, some of which are more fully stated in the\r\npapers referred to, while I admit that the areas of coal accumulation\r\nwere frequently submerged, I must maintain that the true coal is a\r\nsubaërial accumulation by vegetable growth on soils wet and swampy,\r\nit is true, but not submerged. I would add the further consideration,\r\nalready urged elsewhere, that in the case of the fossil forests\r\nassociated with the coal, the conditions of submergence and silting-up\r\nwhich have preserved the trees as fossils, must have been precisely\r\nthose which were fatal to their existence as living plants, a fact\r\nsufficiently evident to us in the case of modern submarine forests, but\r\noften overlooked by the framers of theories of the accumulation of coal.\r\n\r\nIt seems strange that the occasional inequalities of the floors of\r\nthe coal beds, the sand or gravel ridges which traverse them, the\r\nchannels cut through the coal, the occurrence of patches of sand, and\r\nthe insertion of wedges of such material splitting the beds, have been\r\nregarded by some able geologists as evidences of the aqueous origin of\r\ncoal. In truth, these appearances are of constant occurrence in modern\r\nswamps and marshes, more especially near their margins, or where they\r\nare exposed to the effects of ocean storms or river inundations. The\r\nlamination of the coal has also been adduced as a proof of aqueous\r\ndeposition; but the microscope shows, as I have elsewhere pointed out,\r\nthat this is entirely different from aqueous lamination, and depends\r\non the superposition of successive generations of more or less decayed\r\ntrunks of trees and beds of leaves. The lamination in the truly aqueous\r\ncannels and carbonaceous shales is of a very different character.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to remark that in the above summary I have\r\nhad reference principally to my own observations in the coal formation\r\nof Nova Scotia; but similar facts have been detailed by many other\r\nobservers in other districts.[116]\r\n\r\n[116] Especially Brongniart, Goeppert, Hawkshaw, Lyell, Logan, De la\r\nBoche, Beaumont, Binney, Rogers, Lesquereux, Williamson, Grand' Eury.\r\n\r\nA curious point in connection with the origin of coal is the question\r\nhow could vegetable matter be accumulated in such a pure condition?\r\nThere is less difficulty in regard to this if we consider the coal\r\nas a swamp accumulation _in situ_. It is in this way that the purest\r\nvegetable accumulations take place at present, whereas in lakes and at\r\nthe mouths of rivers vegetable matter is always mixed up with mud. Coal\r\nswamps, however, must have been liable to submergences or to temporary\r\ninundations, and it is no doubt to these that we have to attribute\r\nthe partings of argillaceous matter often found in coal beds, as well\r\nas the occasional gulches cut into the coal and filled with sand and\r\nlenticular masses of earthy matter. To a similar cause we must also\r\nattribute the association of cannel with ordinary coal. The cannel is\r\nreally a pulpy, macerate mass of vegetable matter accumulated in still\r\nwater, surrounded and perhaps filled with growing aquatic herbage.\r\nHence it is in such beds that we find the greatest accumulations of\r\nmacrospores, derived, probably, in great part from aquatic plants.\r\nBuckland long ago compared the matter of cannel to the semi-fluid\r\ndischarge of a bursting bog, and Alex. Agassiz has more recently shown\r\nthat in times of flood the vegetable muck of the Everglades of Florida\r\nflows out in thick inky streams, and may form large beds of vegetable\r\nmatter having the character of the materials of cannel. It is evident\r\nthat in swamps of so great extent as those of the coal formation, there\r\nmust have been shallow lakes and ponds, and wide sluggish streams,\r\nforming areas for the accumulation of vegetable _débris_ and this\r\nreadily accounts for the association of ordinary beds of coal with\r\nthose of cannel, and with bituminous shales or earthy bitumen, as well\r\nas for the occurrence of scales of fish and other aquatic animals in\r\nsuch beds. Lyell's interesting observation of the submerged areas at\r\nNew Madrid, keeping free of Mississippi mud, because fringed with a\r\nfilter of cane-brake, shows that the areas of coal accumulation might\r\noften be inundated without earthy deposit, if, as seems probable, they\r\nwere fringed with dense brakes of calamites, sheltering them from the\r\ninflux of muddy water. It seems also certain that the water of the coal\r\nareas would be brown and laden with imperfect vegetable acids, like\r\nthat of modern bogs, and such water has usually little tendency to\r\ndeposit any mineral matter, even in the pores of vegetable fragments.\r\nThe only exception to this is one which also occurs in modern swamps,\r\nnamely, the tendency to deposit iron, either as carbonate (Clay\r\nIronstone), or sulphide (Iron Pyrite), both of which are products of\r\nmodern bogs, and equally characteristic of the coal swamps.\r\n\r\nWhere great accumulations of sediment are going on, as at the mouths\r\nof modern rivers, there is a tendency to subsidence of the area of\r\nthe deposit, owing to its weight. This applies, perhaps, to a greater\r\nextent to coal areas. Thus the area of a coal swamp would ultimately\r\nsink so low as to be overflowed, and a roof shale would be deposited to\r\nbury up the bed of coal, and transmit it to future ages, chemically,\r\nand mechanically changed by pressure and by that slow decomposition\r\nwhich gradually converts vegetable matter into carbon and hydrocarbons.\r\nThe long continuance and great extent of these alternations of growth\r\nand subsidence is perhaps the most extraordinary fact of all. At the\r\nSouth Joggins, if we include the surfaces having erect trees with those\r\nhaving beds of coal, the process of growth of a forest or bog, and\r\nits burial by subsidence and deposition must have been repeated about\r\na hundred times before the final burial of the whole under the thick\r\nsandstones of the Upper Carboniferous and Permian.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of Sigillaria and other trees of the coal\r\nformation period. These trees and others allied to them, of which there\r\nwere many kinds, may be likened to gigantic club mosses, which they\r\nresembled in fruit and foliage, though vastly more complex in structure\r\nof stem and branch. Some of them, perhaps, were of much higher rank\r\nthan any of the modern plants most nearly allied to them. One of their\r\nmost remarkable features was that of their roots--those Stigmariæ, to\r\nwhich so frequent reference has been made. They differed from modern\r\nroots, not only in some points of structure, but in their regular\r\nbifurcation, and in having huge root fibres articulated to the roots,\r\nand arranged in a regular spiral manner, like leaves. They radiate\r\nregularly from a single stem, and do not seem to have sent up buds or\r\nsecondary stems. They thus differed from the botanical definition of a\r\nroot, and also from that of a rhizoma, or root stock; being, in short,\r\na primitive and generalized contrivance, suited to trees themselves\r\nprimitive and generalized, and to special and peculiar circumstances\r\nof growth. Some botanists have imagined that they were aquatic plants,\r\ngrowing at the bottom of lakes, but their mode of occurrence negatives\r\nthis. I have elsewhere stated this as follows:--[117]\r\n\r\n[117] _Natural Science_, May, 1892.\r\n\r\n\"It is quite certain that Stigmariæ are not 'rhizomes which floated\r\nin water, or spread themselves out on the surface of mud.' Whether\r\nrhizomes or not, they grew in the soil, or in the upper layers of peaty\r\ndeposits since changed into coal. The late Richard Brown and the writer\r\nhave shown that they grew in the underclays or fossil soils, and that\r\ntheir rootlets radiated in these soils in all directions.[118] In one\r\nof my papers I have figured a Stigmarian root penetrating through an\r\nerect _Sigillaria_, and Logan, in his Report of 1845, had already\r\nfigured a similar example. The penetration of decaying stems by the\r\nrootlets of _Stigmaria_ is a fact well known to all who have studied\r\nslices of Carboniferous plants,[119] while _Stigmariæ_ are often found\r\ncreeping inside the bark of erect and prostrate trunks. Besides this,\r\nas I have shown in 'Acadian Geology,' in the section of 5,000 feet\r\nof coal measures at the South Joggins (including eighty-one distinct\r\ncoal groups, and a larger number of soils with _Stigmaria_, or erect\r\ntrees), _Sigillaria_ and _Stigmaria_ occur together, and the latter\r\nnearly always either in argillaceous soils, or sands hardened into\r\n'Gannister,' which are often filled with roots or rootlets, or on the\r\nsurfaces of coal beds. On the other hand, the numerous bituminous\r\nlimestones, and calcareous and other shales holding remains of fishes,\r\ncrustaceans, and bivalve shells do not contain Stigmaria _in situ_--the\r\nonly exceptions being two beds of bituminous limestone, the upper\r\nparts of which have been converted into underclays. This section, and\r\nthat of North Sydney--two of the most complete and instructive in\r\nthe world--have afforded conclusive proof of this mode of growth of\r\n_Sigillaria_ and _Stigmaria_.\r\n\r\n[118] _Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc._, vol. ii. p. 394 (1846); _Ibid._, vol.\r\niv. p. 47 (1847); _Ibid._, vol. v. p. 355 (1849); _Ibid._, vol. v. pp.\r\n23, 30.\r\n\r\n[119] Williamson has noticed this in his excellent Memoirs in the\r\n_Phil. Trans._\r\n\r\n\"The objection to calling the Stigmariæ roots and their processes\r\nrootlets, appears to me a finical application of modern botanical\r\nusages to times for which they do not hold. We might equally object\r\nto the application of the term roots to those which spring from the\r\nearthed-up stems of Calamites, radiating as they do from nodes which,\r\nin the air, would produce branchlets. Grand' Eury's figures show\r\nabundant instances of this. We might also object to the exogenous stems\r\ndescribed by Williamson, which belong to cryptogamous plants; and,\r\nunlike anything modern, are made up exclusively of scalariform tissue.\r\nIf the articulation and regular arrangement of those gigantic root\r\nhairs, the rootlets, or 'leaves' of _Stigmaria_, are to be regarded\r\nas depriving them of the name which clearly describes their function,\r\nwe may call them underground branches, though, by so doing, we set at\r\nnought both their function and their mode of growth.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Williamson, in a recent paper, expresses the same view in the\r\nfollowing terms[120]:--\"At that period (the Carboniferous age) no\r\nAngiosperms existed on the earth, and even the Gymnosperms were very\r\nfar from reaching their modern development. Under these circumstances\r\nthe Cryptogams chiefly became the giant forest trees of that remote\r\nage. To become such, they required an organization very different in\r\nsome respects from that of their degraded living representatives. Hence\r\nwe must not appeal to these degenerate types for illustrations and\r\nexplanations of structures no longer existing. Still less must we turn\r\nto what we find in the Angiosperms, that wholly distinct race which has\r\ntaken the place of the primæval Cryptogams in our woods. The primeval\r\ngiants of the swampy forests had doubtless a morphology assigned to\r\nthem, adapted to the physical conditions by which they were surrounded;\r\nbut if even their dwarfed and otherwise modified descendants fail to\r\nthrow light upon morphological details once so common, still less must\r\nwe expect to obtain that light from the living and wholly different\r\nflowering plants.\"\r\n\r\n[120] _Natural Science_, July, 1892.\r\n\r\nWith the remarkable trees above referred to, there coëxisted a vast\r\nmultitude of ferns, some arborescent, others herbaceous, tall,\r\nreed-like plants, the Calamites, allied to modern Mare's-tails, a\r\nvery remarkable family of plants allied to modern Cycads and Pines;\r\nthe Cordaites, which seem to have grown plentifully in certain parts\r\nof the coal areas--probably the drier parts, so that their remains\r\nsometimes constitute the greater part of small seams of coal. There\r\nwere also true pine-like trees, though these would seem to have grown\r\nmost abundantly on the higher levels. Nor was strictly aquatic\r\nvegetation wanting. We find, both in the preceding Devonian and the\r\nCarboniferous, that the little aquatic plants now known as Rhizocarps,\r\nand structurally allied to the Ferns--such plants as the floating\r\nSalvinia, and the Pillworts of our swamps, were vastly abundant, and\r\nthey may have filled and choked up with their exuberant growth many of\r\nthe lakes and slow streams of the period, furnishing layers of cannel\r\nand \"macrospore\" coal, and earthly bitumen or Torbanite.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto confined our attention to the great Carboniferous\r\nperiod, so called, as emphatically the age of coal; but this mineral,\r\nand allied forms of carbon, were produced both before and after. Even\r\nin that old Laurentian age, which includes the oldest rocks that we\r\nknow, formed when the first land had just risen out of the waters,\r\nthere are thick beds of graphite, or plumbago, chemically the same with\r\nanthracite coal, and which must have been produced by the agency of\r\nplants, whether terrestrial or aquatic. We may suppose that the plants\r\nof this remote age were of very humble type as much lower than those\r\nof the coal formation as these are lower than those of the present\r\nday; but if so, then, on the analogy of the Carboniferous, they would\r\nbe high and complex representatives of those low types. But there is\r\nanother and more startling possibility; that the Laurentian may have\r\nbeen a period when vegetable life culminated on the earth, and existed\r\nin its most complete and grandest forms in advance of the time when\r\nit was brought into subordination to the higher life of the animal.\r\nIn the meantime, the Laurentian rocks are in a state of so extreme\r\nmetamorphism that they have afforded no certain indication of the forms\r\nor structures of the vegetation of the period.\r\n\r\nWe find indications of plant life through all the Palæozoic groups\r\nsucceeding the Laurentian; but it is not till we reach the Devonian,\r\nthe system immediately preceding the Carboniferous, that we find\r\nan abundance of forms not essentially different from those of the\r\nCarboniferous, though similar in details. Only a few and very small\r\nbeds of coal were accumulated in this age; but there was an immense\r\nabundance of bituminous shale enriched with the macrospores of\r\nRhizocarps. The Ohio black shale, which is said to extend its outcrop\r\nacross that state with a breadth of ten to twenty miles, and a\r\nthickness of 550 feet, is filled with macrospores of Protosalvinia, as\r\nis its continuation in Canada.\r\n\r\nAbove the great coal formation the Permian and Jurassic contain beds\r\nof coal, though of limited extent, and formed in the case of the two\r\nlatter of very different plants from those of the Carboniferous. In\r\nthe Cretaceous and Tertiary ages, after the abundant introduction\r\nof species of forest trees still living, coal making seems to have\r\nobtained a new impulse, so that in China and the western part of\r\nAmerica there are coals of great extent and value, all made of plants\r\nof genera still existing. In the Cretaceous coal of Vancouver Island\r\nthere are remains of such modern trees as the Poplars, Magnolias,\r\nPalmettos, Sequoias, and a great variety of other genera still living\r\nin America. Out of the remains of these, under favouring conditions,\r\nquite as good coal as that of the coal formation has been made,\r\nalthough the plants are so different. There is, indeed, reason to\r\nbelieve that those now rare trees, the Sequoias, represented at the\r\npresent time only by the big trees of California, and their companion,\r\nthe redwood, were then spread universally over the northern hemisphere,\r\nand formed dense forests on swampy flats which led to the accumulation\r\nof coal beds in which the trunks and leaves of the Sequoias formed\r\nmain ingredients, so that Sequoia and its allies in this later age\r\ntake the place of the Sigillariæ of the coal formation. Last of all,\r\ncoal accumulation is still going on in the Everglades of Florida,\r\nthe dismal swamp of Virginia, and the peat-bogs of the more northern\r\nregions. So the vegetable kingdom has, throughout its long history,\r\nbeen continually depriving the atmosphere of its carbon dioxide, and\r\naccumulating this in beds of coal. In the earlier ages indeed, this\r\nwould seem to us to have been its main use.\r\n\r\nTo the modern naturalist, vegetable life, with regard to its uses,\r\nis the great accumulator of pabulum for the sustenance of the higher\r\nforms of vital energy manifested in the animal. In the Palæozoic this\r\nconsideration sinks in importance. In the Coal period we know few land\r\nanimals, and these not vegetable feeders, with the exception of some\r\ninsects, millipedes, and snails. But the Carboniferous forests did not\r\nlive in vain, if their only use was to store up the light and heat of\r\nthose old summers in the form of coal, and to remove the excess of\r\ncarbonic acid from the atmosphere. In the Devonian period even these\r\nutilities fail, for coal does not seem to have been accumulated to\r\nany great extent, though the abundant petroleum of the Devonian is,\r\nno doubt, due to the agency of aquatic vegetation. In addition to\r\nscorpions, a few insects are the only known tenants of the Devonian\r\nland, and these are of kinds whose lame probably lived in water, and\r\nwere not dependent on land plants. We may have much yet to learn of the\r\nanimal life of the Devonian; but for the present, the great plan of\r\nvegetable nature goes beyond our measures of utility; and there remains\r\nonly what is perhaps the most wonderful and suggestive correlation\r\nof all, namely, that our minds are able to trace in these perished\r\norganisms structures similar to those of modern plants, and thus to\r\nreproduce in imagination the forms and habits of growth of living\r\nthings which so long preceded us on the earth.\r\n\r\nIn another way Huxley has put the utilitarian aspect of the case so\r\nadmirably, that I cannot refrain from quoting his clever apotheosis of\r\nnature in connection with the production of coal.\r\n\r\n\"Nature is never in a hurry, and seems to have had always before her\r\neyes the adage, 'Keep a thing long enough, and you will find a use for\r\nit.' She has kept her beds of coal for millions of years without being\r\nable to find a use for them; she has sent them beneath the sea, and the\r\nsea beasts could make nothing of them; she had raised them up into dry\r\nland, and laid the black veins bare, and still for ages and ages there\r\nwas no living thing on the face of the earth that could see any sort\r\nof value in them; and it was only the other day, so to speak, that she\r\nturned a new creature out of her workshop, who, by degrees, acquired\r\nsufficient wits to make a fire, and then to discover that the black\r\nrock would burn.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose that nineteen hundred years ago, when Julius Cæsar was good\r\nenough to deal with Britain as we have dealt with New Zealand, the\r\nprimæval Briton, blue with cold and woad, may have known that the\r\nstrange black stone which he found here and there in his wanderings\r\nwould burn, and so help to warm his body and cook his food. Saxon,\r\nDane, and Norman swarmed into the land. The English people grew into a\r\npowerful nation; and Nature still waited for a return for the capital\r\nshe had invested in ancient club mosses. The eighteenth century\r\narrived, and with it James Watt. The brain of that man was the spore\r\nout of which was developed the steam engine, and all the prodigious\r\ntrees and branches of modern industry which have grown out of this. But\r\ncoal is as much an essential of this growth and development as carbonic\r\nacid is of a club moss. Wanting the coal, we could not have smelted\r\nthe iron needed to make our engines; nor have worked our engines\r\nwhen we got them. But take away the engines, and the great towns of\r\nYorkshire and Lancashire vanish like a dream. Manufactures give place\r\nto agriculture and pasture, and not ten men could live where now ten\r\nthousand are amply supported.\r\n\r\n\"Thus all this abundant wealth of money and of vivid life is Nature's\r\ninvestment in club mosses and the like so long ago. But what becomes\r\nof the coal which is burnt in yielding the interest? Heat comes out\r\nof it, light comes out of it, and if we could gather together all that\r\ngoes up the chimney, and all that remains in the grate of a thoroughly\r\nburnt coal fire, we should find ourselves in possession of a quantity\r\nof carbonic acid, water, ammonia, and mineral matters exactly equal in\r\nweight to the coal. But these are the very matters with which Nature\r\nsupplied the club mosses which made coal. She is paid back principal\r\nand interest at the same time; and she straightway invests the carbonic\r\nacid, the water, and the ammonia in new forms of life, feeding with\r\nthem the plants that now live.

If\r\nwe divide the animal kingdom into great leading types, the lowest of\r\nthese groups, the Protozoa, includes only aquatic forms; the next,\r\nthat of the coral animals and their allies, is also aquatic. So are\r\nall the species of the Sea Urchins and Star Fishes. Of the remaining\r\ngroups, the Mollusks, the Crustaceans, and the Worms are dominantly\r\naquatic, only a small proportion being air-breathers. It is only in\r\nthe two remaining groups, including the Insects and Spiders on the one\r\nhand, and the Vertebrate animals on the other, that we have terrestrial\r\nspecies in large proportion.\r\n\r\nThe same fact appears in geological time. The periods represented by\r\nthe older Palæozoic rocks have been termed ages of invertebrates,\r\nand they might also be termed ages of aquatic animals. It is only\r\ngradually, and as it were with difficulty, that animals living in the\r\nless congenial element of air are introduced--at first a few scorpions\r\nand insects, later, land snails and amphibian reptiles, later still,\r\nthe higher reptiles and the birds, and last of all the higher mammalia.\r\n\r\nWe need not wonder at this, for the conditions of life with reference\r\nto support, locomotion, and vicissitudes of temperature are more\r\ncomplex and difficult in air, and require more complicated and perfect\r\nmachinery for their maintenance. Thus it was that probably half of the\r\nwhole history of our earth had passed away before the land became\r\nthe abode of any large number and variety of animals; while it was\r\nonly about the same time that the development of the vegetable kingdom\r\nbecame so complete as to afford food and shelter for air-breathers.\r\n\r\nIt is also worthy of note that it is only in comparatively recent times\r\nthat we have been able to discover the oldest air-breathing animals,\r\nand geologists long believed that the time when animals had existed on\r\nthe land was even shorter than it had actually been. This arose in part\r\nfrom the infrequency and rarity of preservation of the remains of the\r\nearliest creatures of this kind, and perhaps partly from the fact that\r\ncollectors were not looking for them.\r\n\r\nThat there was dry land, even in the Cambro-Silurian period, we know,\r\nand can even trace its former shores. In Canada our old Laurentian\r\ncoast extends for more than a thousand miles, from Labrador to Lake\r\nSuperior, marking the southern border of the nucleus of the American\r\ncontinent in the Cambrian and Cambro-Silurian periods. Along a great\r\npart of this ancient coast we have the sand flats of the Potsdam\r\nSandstone, affording very favourable conditions for the imbedding of\r\nland animals, did these exist; still, notwithstanding the zealous\r\nexplorations of the Geological Survey, and of many amateurs, no trace\r\nof an air-breather has been found. I have myself followed the oldest\r\nPalæozoic beds up to their ancient limits in some localities, and\r\ncollected the shells which the waves had dashed on the beach, and have\r\nseen under the Cambro-Silurian beds the old pre-Cambrian rocks pitted\r\nand indented with weather marks, showing that this shore was then\r\ngradually subsiding; yet the record of the rocks was totally silent\r\nas to the animals that may have trod the shore, or the trees that may\r\nhave waved over it. All that can be said is that the sun shone, the\r\nrain fell, and the wind blew as it does now, and that the sea abounded\r\nin living creatures. The eyes of Trilobites, the weathered Laurentian\r\nrocks, the wind ripples in the Potsdam sandstone, the rich fossils\r\nof the limestones, testify to these things. The existence of such\r\nconditions would lead us to hope that land animals may yet be found in\r\nthese older formations. On the other hand, the gradual failure of one\r\nform of life after another, as we descend in the geological series, and\r\nthe rarity of fishes and land plants in the Silurian rocks and their\r\nabsence from the Cambrian, might induce us to believe that we have here\r\nreached the beginning of animal life, and have left far behind us those\r\nforms that inhabit the land.\r\n\r\nEven in the Carboniferous period, though land plants abound,\r\nair-breathers are not numerous, and most of them have only been\r\nrecently recognised. We know, however, with certainty that the dark and\r\nluxuriant forests of the coal period were not destitute of animal life.\r\nReptiles[122] crept under their shade, land snails and millipedes fed\r\non the rank leaves and decaying vegetable matter, and insects flitted\r\nthrough the air of the sunnier spots. Great interest attaches to these\r\ncreatures; perhaps the first-born species in some of their respective\r\ntypes, and certainly belonging to one of the oldest land faunas, and\r\npresenting prototypes of future forms equally interesting to the\r\ngeologist and the zoologist.\r\n\r\n[122] I shall use the term reptile here in its broad, popular sense, as\r\nincluding Batrachians as well as reptiles proper.\r\n\r\nIt has happened to the writer of these pages to have had some share in\r\nthe finding of several of these ancient animals. The coal formation of\r\nNova Scotia, so full in its development, so rich in fossil remains, and\r\nso well exposed in coast cliffs, has afforded admirable opportunities\r\nfor such discoveries, which have been so far improved that at least\r\ntwenty-five out of the not very large number of known Carboniferous\r\nland animals have been obtained from it.[123] The descriptions of\r\nthese creatures, found at various times and at various places, are\r\nscattered through papers ranging in date from 1844 to 1891,[124]\r\nand are too fragmentary to give complete information respecting the\r\nstructures of the animals, and their conditions of existence.\r\n\r\n[123] It appears that about a hundred species of Carboniferous reptiles\r\nhave been recognised on the continent of Europe, in Great Britain, and\r\nin the United States. They belong to a number of distinct types, all,\r\nhowever, being of batrachian affinities.\r\n\r\n[124] Papers by Lyell, Owen, and the author, in the _Journal of the\r\nGeological Society of London_, i. ii. ix. x. xi. xvi. xvii. xviii.;\r\n\"Acadian Geology,\" by the author; Papers in _Trans. Royal Society of\r\nLondon_, _Am. Jl. of Science_, and _Geological Magazine_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFootprints.\r\n\r\nIt has often happened to geologists, as to other explorers of\r\nnew regions, that footprints on the sand have guided them to the\r\ninhabitants of unknown lands, and such footprints, proverbially\r\nperishable, may be so preserved by being filled up with matter\r\ndeposited in them as to endure for ever. This we may see to-day in\r\nthe tracks of sandpipers and marks of rain-drops preserved in the\r\nlayers of alluvial mud deposited by the tides of the Bay of Fundy, and\r\nwhich, if baked or hardened by pressure, might become imperishable,\r\nlike the inscriptions of the old Chaldeans on their tablets of baked\r\nclay. The first trace ever observed of reptiles in the Carboniferous\r\nsystem consisted of a series of small but well-marked footprints found\r\nby Sir W. E. Logan, in 1841, in the lower coal measures of Horton\r\nBluff, in Nova Scotia; and as the authors of most of our general\r\nworks on geology have hitherto, in so far as I am aware, failed to do\r\njustice to this discovery, I shall notice it here in detail. In the\r\nyear above mentioned, Sir William, then Mr. Logan, examined the coal\r\nfields of Pennsylvania and Nova Scotia, with the view of studying\r\ntheir structure, and extending the application of the discoveries\r\nas to beds with roots, or Stigmaria underclays, which he had made\r\nin the Welsh coal fields. On his return to England he read a paper\r\non these subjects before the Geological Society of London, in which\r\nhe noticed the subject of reptilian footprints at Horton Bluff. The\r\nspecimen was exhibited at the meeting of the Society, and was, I\r\nbelieve, admitted, on the high authority of Prof. Owen, to be probably\r\nreptilian. Unfortunately Sir William's paper appeared only in abstract\r\nin the Transactions; and in this abstract, though the footprints are\r\nmentioned, no opinion is expressed as to their nature. Sir William's\r\nown opinion is thus stated in a letter to me, dated June, 1843, when\r\nhe was on his way to Canada, to commence the survey which has since\r\ndeveloped so astonishing a mass of geological facts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Footprints of _Hylopus Logani_, Dawson, Lower\r\nCarboniferous, Nova Scotia.\r\n\r\nNatural size and reduced.\r\n\r\nThese footprints were the first indications of Carboniferous land\r\nvertebrates ever observed; they were probably made by a Microsaurian\r\nand one of the earliest species of this type. They show a remarkable\r\nlength of stride and development of limb.]\r\n\r\n\"Among the specimens which I carried from Horton Bluff, one is of very\r\nhigh interest. It exhibits the footprints of some reptilian animal.\r\nOwen has no doubt of the marks being genuine footprints. The rocks of\r\nHorton Bluff are below the gypsum of that neighbourhood; so that the\r\nspecimen in question (if Lyell's views are correct[125]) comes from the\r\nvery bottom of the coal series, or at any rate very low down in it, and\r\ndemonstrates the existence of reptiles at an earlier epoch than has\r\nhitherto been determined; none having been previously found below the\r\nmagnesian limestone, or, to give it Murchison's new name, the 'Permian\r\nera.'\"\r\n\r\n[125] Sir Charles Lyell had then just read a paper announcing his\r\ndiscovery that the gypsiferous system of Nova Scotia is Lower\r\nCarboniferous, in which he mentions the footprints referred to, as\r\nbeing reptilian.\r\n\r\nThis extract is of interest, not merely as an item of evidence in\r\nrelation to the matter now in hand, but as a mark in the progress of\r\ngeological investigation. For the reasons above stated, the important\r\ndiscovery thus made in 1841, and published in 1842, was overlooked; and\r\nthe discovery of reptilian bones by Von Dechen, at Saarbruck, in 1844,\r\nand that of footprints by Dr. King in the same year, in Pennsylvania,\r\nhave been uniformly referred to as the first observations of this\r\nkind. Insects and Arachnidans, it may be observed, had previously been\r\ndiscovered in the coal formation in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe original specimen of these footprints is still in the collection\r\nof the Geological Survey of Canada, and a cast which Logan kindly\r\npresented to me is exhibited in the Peter Redpath Museum of McGill\r\nUniversity. It is a slab of dark-coloured sandstone, glazed with fine\r\nclay on the surface; and having a series of seven footprints in two\r\nrows, distant about three inches; the distance of the impressions in\r\neach row being three or four inches, and the individual impressions\r\nabout one inch in length. They seem to have been made by the points of\r\nthe toes, which must have been armed with strong and apparently blunt\r\nclaws, and appear as if either the surface had been somewhat firm,\r\nor the body of the animal had been partly water-borne. In one place\r\nonly is there a distinct mark of the whole foot, as if the animal\r\nhad exerted an unusual pressure in turning or stopping suddenly. One\r\npair of feet--the fore feet, I presume--appear to have had four toes\r\ntouching the ground; the other pair show only three or four, and it\r\nis to be observed that the outer toe, as in the larger footprints\r\ndiscovered by Dr. King, projects in the manner of a thumb, as in the\r\ncheirotherian tracks of the Trias. At a later date another series of\r\nfootprints, possibly of the same animal, was obtained at the same\r\nplace by Prof. Elder, and is now in the Peter Redpath Museum. Each\r\nfoot in this shows five toes, and it is remarkable that the animal was\r\ndigitigrade and took a long step for its size, indicating a somewhat\r\nhigh grade of quadrupedal organization. No mark of the tail or belly\r\nappears. The impressions are such as may have been made by animals\r\nsimilar to some of those to be described in the sequel.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward, Dr. Harding, of Windsor, when examining a cargo of\r\nsandstone which had been landed at that place from Parrsboro', found\r\non one of the slabs a very distinct series of footprints, each with\r\nfour toes, and a trace of the fifth. Dr. Harding's specimen is now\r\nin the museum of King's College, Windsor. Its impressions are more\r\ndistinct, but not very different otherwise from those above described,\r\nas found at Horton Bluff. The rocks at that place are probably of\r\nnearly the same age with those of Parrsboro'. I afterward examined the\r\nplace from which this slab had been quarried, and satisfied myself\r\nthat the beds are Carboniferous, and probably Lower Carboniferous.\r\nThey were ripple-marked and sun-cracked, and I thought I could detect\r\nsome footprints, though more obscure than those in Dr. Harding's slab.\r\nSimilar footprints are also stated to have been found by Dr. Gesner, at\r\nParrsboro'. All of these were from the lowest beds of the Carboniferous\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nI have since observed several instances of such impressions at the\r\nJoggins, at Horton, and near Windsor, showing that they are by no means\r\nrare, and that reptilian animals existed in no inconsiderable numbers\r\nthroughout the coal field of Nova Scotia, and from the beginning to the\r\nend of the Carboniferous period. Most of these, when well preserved,\r\nshew five toes both on the anterior and posterior limb. On comparing\r\nthese earlier Carboniferous footprints with one another, it will be\r\nobserved that they are of similar general character, and may have been\r\nmade by one kind of animal, which must have had the fore and hind feet\r\nnearly of equal size, and a digitigrade mode of walking. Footprints of\r\nsimilar form are found in the coal formation, as well as others of much\r\nlarger size. The latter are of two kinds. One of these shows short hind\r\nfeet of digitigrade character and a long stride, in this resembling the\r\nsmaller footprints of the Lower Carboniferous, which are remarkable\r\nfor the length of limb which they indicate by the distance between the\r\nfootprints. The other kind shows long hind feet, as if the whole heel\r\nwere brought down to the ground in a plantigrade manner. These have\r\nalso the outer toe separated from the others, and sometimes provided\r\nwith a long claw. The fore foot is sometimes smaller than the hind\r\nfoot, and differently formed.[126] In these respects they resemble the\r\ngreat Labyrinthodont Batrachians of the subsequent Trias. Their stride\r\nalso is comparatively short, and the rows of impressions wide apart, as\r\nif the body of the animal had been broad, and its limbs short.\r\n\r\n[126] Fine slabs of these footprints have been presented by Mr.\r\nSandford Fleming to the Geological Survey of Canada.\r\n\r\nWe have thus two types of quadrupedal footprints, to the first of\r\nwhich I have given the name Hylopus, and have restricted the term\r\nSauropus,[127] to the second. The first apparently belongs to the\r\nusually small reptiles of the group _Microsauria_, which had a\r\nwell-marked lizard-like form, with well-developed limbs, and perhaps\r\nalso to some of the smaller Labyrinthodonts, the second to the group\r\nof _Labyrinthodontia_, which were often of large size and with stout\r\nand short limbs and plantigrade hind feet. There are also some small\r\nand uncertain tracks, which may have been made by newt-like animals\r\nwith short feet, and a singular trail of large size, and with a row\r\nof impressions at each side (Diplichnites),[128] which, if made by a\r\nvertebrate animal, would seem to indicate that serpentiform shape which\r\nwe know belonged to some Carboniferous Batrachians.\r\n\r\n[127] Given by King.\r\n\r\n[128] Impressions and Footprints of Animals, _Am. Jour. Sci._, 1873.\r\n\r\nThe bones of these animals, however, hitherto found in Nova Scotia, may\r\nall have belonged to the two groups first named, the Labyrinthodontia\r\nand Microsauria, and I shall proceed to give some examples of each of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nIn leaving the footprints, I may merely mention that the animals\r\nwhich produced them may, in certain circumstances, have left distinct\r\nimpressions only of three or four toes, when they actually possessed\r\nfive, while in other circumstances all may have left marks; and that,\r\nwhen wading in deep mud, their footprints were altogether different\r\nfrom those made on hard sand or clay. In some instances the impressions\r\nmay have been made by animals wading or swimming in water, while in\r\nothers the rain marks and sun cracks afford evidence that the surface\r\nwas a subaërial one. They are chiefly interesting as indicating the\r\nwide diffusion and abundance of the creatures producing them, and that\r\nthey haunted tidal flats and muddy shores, perhaps emerging from the\r\nwater that they might bask in the sun, or possibly searching for food\r\namong the rejectamenta of the sea, or of lagunes and estuaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Labyrinthodonts of the Coal Period, Baphetes Planiceps and\r\nDendrerpeton Acadianum.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1851 I had occasion to spend a day at the Albion Mines\r\nin the eastern part of Nova Scotia, and on arriving at the railway\r\nstation in the afternoon, found myself somewhat too early for the\r\ntrain. By way of improving the time thus left on my hands, I betook\r\nmyself to the examination of a large pile of rubbish, consisting of\r\nshale and ironstone from one of the pits, and in which I had previously\r\nfound scales and teeth of fishes. In the blocks of hard carbonaceous\r\nshale and earthy coal, of which the pile chiefly consisted, scales,\r\nteeth and coprolites often appeared on the weathered ends and surfaces\r\nas whitish spots. In looking for these, I observed one of much greater\r\nsize than usual on the edge of a block, and on splitting it open, found\r\na large flattened skull, about six inches broad, the cranial bones of\r\nwhich remained entire on one side of the mass, while the palate and\r\nteeth, in several fragments, came away with the other half. Carefully\r\ntrimming the larger specimen, and gathering all the smaller fragments,\r\nI packed them up as safely as possible, and returned from my little\r\nexcursion much richer than I had hoped.\r\n\r\nThe specimen, on further examination, proved somewhat puzzling. I\r\nsupposed it to be, most probably, the head of a large ganoid fish;\r\nbut it seemed different from anything of this kind with which I could\r\ncompare it; and at a distance from comparative anatomists, and without\r\nsufficient means of determination, I dared not refer it to anything\r\nhigher in the animal scale. Hoping for further light, I packed it\r\nup with some other specimens, and sent it to the Secretary of the\r\nGeological Society of London, with an explanatory note as to its\r\ngeological position, and requesting that it might be submitted to some\r\none versed in such fossils. For a year or two, however, it remained as\r\nquietly in the Society's collection as if in its original bed in the\r\ncoal mine, until attention having been attracted to such remains by the\r\ndiscoveries made by Sir Charles Lyell and myself in 1852, at the South\r\nJoggins, and published in 1853,[129] the Secretary or President of the\r\nSociety re-discovered the specimen, and handed it to Sir Richard Owen,\r\nby whom it was described in December, 1853,[130] under the name of\r\n_Baphetes planiceps_, which may be interpreted the \"flat-headed diving\r\nanimal,\" in allusion to the flatness of the creature's skull, and the\r\npossibility that it may have been in the habit of diving.\r\n\r\n[129] _Journal of Geological Society of London_, vol. ix.\r\n\r\n[130] _Journal of Geological Society_, vol. x.; and additional notes,\r\nvol. xi.\r\n\r\nThe parts preserved in my specimen are the bones of the anterior and\r\nupper part of the skull in one fragment, and the teeth and palatal\r\nbones in others. These parts were carefully examined and described by\r\nOwen, and the details will be found in his papers referred to in the\r\nnote. We may merely observe here that the form and arrangement of the\r\nbones showed batrachian affinities, that the surface of the cranium was\r\nsculptured in the manner of the group of Labyrinthodonts, and that the\r\nteeth possessed the peculiar and complicated plication of the ivory and\r\nenamel seen in creatures of this type. The whole of these characters\r\nare regarded as allying the animal with the great crocodilian frogs\r\nof the Trias of Europe, first known as _Cheirotherians_, owing to the\r\nremarkable hand-like impressions of their feet, and afterwards as\r\n_Labyrinthodonts_, from the beautifully complicated convolutions of the\r\nivory of their teeth.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the original specimen exhibited only the head, and after\r\nmuch and frequent subsequent searching, the only other bones found are\r\na scapula, or shoulder bone, and one of the surface scales which served\r\nfor protection, and which indicate at least that the creature possessed\r\nwalking limbs and was armed with bony scales sculptured in the same\r\nmanner with the skull bones.\r\n\r\nOf the general form and dimensions of _Baphetes_, the facts at present\r\nknown do not enable us to say much. Its formidable teeth and strong\r\nmaxillary bones show that it must have devoured animals of considerable\r\nsize, probably the fishes whose remains are found with it, or the\r\nsmaller reptiles of the coal. It must, in short, have been crocodilian,\r\nrather than frog-like, in its mode of life; but whether, like the\r\nLabyrinthodonts, it had strong limbs and a short body, or like the\r\ncrocodiles, an elongated form and a powerful natatory tail, the remains\r\ndo not decide. One of the limbs or a vertebra of the tail would settle\r\nthis question, but neither has as yet been found. That there were large\r\nanimals of the labyrinthodontal form in the coal period is proved by\r\nthe footprints discovered by Dr. King in Pennsylvania, which may have\r\nbeen produced by an animal of the type of _Baphetes_, as well as by\r\nthose of _Sauropus unguifer_ from the Carboniferous of Nova Scotia,\r\nand which would very well suit an animal of this size and probable\r\nform. On the other hand, that there were large swimming reptiles seems\r\nestablished by the discovery of the vertebræ of _Eosaurus Acadianus_,\r\nat the Joggins, by Marsh.[131] The locomotion of _Baphetes_ must have\r\nbeen vigorous and rapid, but it may have been effected both on land and\r\nin water, and either by feet or tail, or both. A jawbone found at the\r\nJoggins in Nova Scotia, and to which I have attached the name _Baphetes\r\nminor_, may have belonged to a second species. Great Batrachians allied\r\nto Baphetes, but different specifically or generically, have since been\r\nfound in the coal formations of Great Britain, the continent of Europe\r\nand the United States.\r\n\r\n[131] _Silliman's Journal_, 1859.\r\n\r\nWith the nature of the habitat of this formidable creature we are\r\nbetter acquainted. The area of the Albion Mines coal field was\r\nsomewhat exceptional in its character. It seems to have been a bay or\r\nindentation in the Silurian land, separated from the remainder of the\r\ncoal field by a high shingle beach, now a bed of conglomerate. Owing\r\nto this circumstance, while in the other portions of the Nova Scotia\r\ncoal field the beds of coal are thin, and alternate with sandstones\r\nand shales, at the Albion Mines a vast thickness of almost unmixed\r\nvegetable matter has been deposited, constituting the \"main seam\" of\r\nthirty-eight feet thick, and the \"deep seam,\" twenty-four feet thick,\r\nas well as still thicker beds of highly carbonaceous shale. But, though\r\nthe area of the Albion coal measures was thus separated, and preserved\r\nfrom marine incursions, it must have been often submerged, and probably\r\nhad connection with the sea, through rivers or channels cutting the\r\nenclosing beach. Hence beds of earthy matter occur in it, containing\r\nremains of large fishes. One of the most important of these is that\r\nknown as the \"Holing stone,\" a band of black highly carbonaceous shale,\r\ncoaly matter, and clay ironstone, occurring in the main seam, about\r\nfive feet below its roof, and varying in thickness from two inches to\r\nnearly two feet. It was from this band that the rubbish heap in which I\r\nfound the skull of _Baphetes planiceps_ was derived. It is a laminated\r\nbed, sometimes hard and containing much ironstone, in other places soft\r\nand shaly, but always black and carbonaceous, and often with layers\r\nof coarse coal, though with few fossil plants retaining their forms.\r\nIt contains large round flat scales and flattened curved teeth, which\r\nI attribute to a fish of the genus _Rhizodus_, resembling, if not\r\nidentical with, _R. lancifer_, Newberry. With these are double-pointed\r\nshark-like teeth, and long cylindrical spines of a species of _Diplodus_,\r\nwhich I have named _D. acinaces.[132]_ There are also shells of the\r\nminute _Spirorbis_, so common in the coal measures of other parts of\r\nNova Scotia, and abundance of fragments of coprolitic matter, or fossil\r\nexcrement, sometimes containing bones and scales of fishes.\r\n\r\n[132] \"Supplement to Acadian Geology,\" pp. 43 and 50. These fishes are\r\nnow known under the generic name Leptacanthus.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the \"Holing stone\" indicates one of those periods\r\nin which the Albion coal area, or a large part of it, was under\r\nwater, probably fresh or brackish, as there are no properly marine\r\nshells in this, or any of the other beds of this coal series. We may\r\nthen imagine a large lake or lagune, loaded with trunks of trees and\r\ndecaying vegetable matter, having in its shallow parts, and along\r\nits sides, dense brakes of _Calamites_, and forests of _Sigillaria_,\r\n_Lepidodendron_, and other trees of the period, extending far on every\r\nside as damp pestilential swamps. In such a habitat, uninviting to\r\nus, but no doubt suited to _Baphetes_, that creature crawled through\r\nswamps and thickets, wallowed in flats of black mud, or swam and dived\r\nin search of its finny prey. It was, in so far as we know, the monarch\r\nof these swamps, though there is, as already stated, evidence of the\r\nexistence of similar creatures of this type quite as large in other\r\nparts of the Nova Scotia coal field. We must now notice a smaller\r\nanimal belonging to the same family of Labyrinthodonts.\r\n\r\nThe geology of Nova Scotia is largely indebted to the world-embracing\r\nlabours of Sir Charles Lyell. Though much had previously been done\r\nby others, his personal explorations in 1842, and his paper on the\r\ngypsiferous formation, published in the following year, first gave\r\nform and shape to some of the more difficult features of the geology\r\nof the country, and brought it into relation with that of other parts\r\nof the world. In geological investigation, as in many other things,\r\npatient plodding may accumulate large stores of fact, but the magic\r\nwand of genius is required to bring out the true value and significance\r\nof these stores of knowledge. It is scarcely too much to say that the\r\nexploration of a few weeks, and subsequent study of the subject by Sir\r\nCharles, with the impulse and guidance given to the labours of others,\r\ndid as much for Nova Scotia as might have been effected by years of\r\nlaborious work under less competent heads.\r\n\r\nSir Charles naturally continued to take an interest in the geology of\r\nNova Scotia, and to entertain a desire to explore more fully some of\r\nthose magnificent coast sections which he had but hastily examined;\r\nand when, in 1851, he had occasion to revisit the United States, he\r\nmade an appointment with the writer of these pages to spend a few\r\ndays in renewed explorations of the cliffs of the South Joggins. The\r\nobject specially in view was the thorough examination of the beds of\r\nthe true coal measures, with reference to their contained fossils, and\r\nthe conditions of accumulation of the coal; and the results were given\r\nto the world in a joint paper on \"The remains of a reptile and a land\r\nshell discovered in the interior of an erect tree in the coal measures\r\nof Nova Scotia,\" and in the writer's paper on the \"Coal Measures of\r\nthe South Joggins\";[133] while other important investigations grew out\r\nof the following up of these researches, and much matter in relation\r\nto the vegetable fossils still remains to be worked up. It is with the\r\nmore striking fact of the discovery of the remains of a reptile in the\r\ncoal measures that we have now to do.\r\n\r\n[133] _Journal of the Geological Society of London_, vols. ix. and x.;\r\nand \"Acadian Geology.\"\r\n\r\nThe South Joggins Section is, among other things, remarkable for the\r\nnumber of beds which contain remains of erect trees imbedded _in situ_:\r\nthese trees are for the most part Sigillariæ, those great-ribbed\r\npillar-like trees which seem to have been so characteristic of the\r\nforests of the coal formation flats and swamps, and so important\r\ncontributors to the formation of coal. They vary in diameter from six\r\ninches to five feet. They have grown on underclays and wet soils,\r\nsimilar to those on which the coal was accumulated; and these having\r\nbeen submerged or buried by mud carried down by inundations, the trees,\r\nkilled by the accumulations around their stems, have decayed, and their\r\ntops being broken off at the level of the mud or sand, the cylindrical\r\ncavities left open by the disappearance of the wood, and preserved in\r\ntheir form by the greater durability of the bark, have been filled with\r\nsand and clay. This, now hardened into stone, constitutes pillar-like\r\ncasts of the trees, which may often be seen exposed in the cliffs,\r\nand which, as these waste away, fall upon the beach. The sandstones\r\nenveloping these pillared trunks of the ancient Sigillariæ of the coal,\r\nare laminated or bedded, and the laminæ, when exposed, split apart with\r\nthe weather, so that the trees themselves become broken across; this\r\nbeing often aided by the arrangement of the matter within the trunks,\r\nin layers more or less corresponding to those without. Thus one of\r\nthese fossil trees usually falls to the beach in a series of discs,\r\nsomewhat resembling the grindstones which are extensively manufactured\r\non the coast. The surfaces of these fragments often exhibit remains\r\nof plants which have been washed into the hollow trunks, and have\r\nbeen imbedded there; and in our explorations of the shore, we always\r\ncarefully scrutinized such specimens, both with the view of observing\r\nwhether they retained the superficial markings of Sigillariæ, and with\r\nreference to the fossils contained in them. It was while examining a\r\npile of these \"fossil grindstones\" that we were surprised by finding\r\non one of them what seemed to be fragments of bone. On careful search\r\nother bones appeared, and they had the aspect, not of remains of\r\nfishes, of which many species are found fossil in these coal measures,\r\nbut rather of limb bones of a quadruped. The fallen pieces of the tree\r\nwere carefully broken up, and other bones disengaged, and at length a\r\njaw with teeth made its appearance. We felt quite confident, from the\r\nfirst, that these bones were reptilian; and the whole, being carefully\r\npacked and labelled, were taken by Sir Charles to the United States,\r\nand submitted to Prof. J. Wyman of Cambridge; who recognised their\r\nreptilian character, and prepared descriptive notes of the principal\r\nbones, which appeared to have belonged to two species. He also observed\r\namong the fragments an object of different character, apparently a\r\nshell; which was recognised by Dr. Gould of Boston, and afterward by\r\nM. Deshayes, as probably a land-snail, and has since been named _Pupa\r\nvetusta_.\r\n\r\nThe specimens were subsequently taken to London and reexamined by\r\nProf. Owen, who confirmed Wyman's inferences, added other characters\r\nto the description, and named the larger and better preserved species\r\n_Dendrerpeton Acadianum_, in allusion to its discovery in the interior\r\nof a tree, and to its native country of Acadia or Nova Scotia. It is\r\nnecessary to state in explanation of the fragmentary character of the\r\nremains obtained, that in the decay of the animals imbedded in the\r\nerect trees at the Joggins, their skeletons have become disarticulated,\r\nand the portions scattered, either by falling into the interstices\r\nof the vegetable fragments in the bottom of the hollow trunks, or by\r\nthe water with which these may have sometimes been partly filled. We\r\nthus usually obtain only separate bones; and though all of these are\r\nno doubt present in each case, it is often impossible in breaking up\r\nthe hard matrix to recover more than a portion of them. The original\r\ndescription by Owen was therefore based on somewhat imperfect material,\r\nbut additional specimens subsequently found have supplemented it\r\nin such a manner as to enable us somewhat completely to restore in\r\nimagination the form of the animal, which, though much smaller than\r\n_Baphetes_, agrees with it in its sculptured bones, in its bony\r\narmature, especially beneath, and in its plicated teeth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Humerus and Mandibles of Dendrerpeton Acadianum. Natural\r\nsize, with one of the teeth enlarged. (From a Photograph.)\r\n\r\nThe specimen illustrates the sculptured bones of Dendrerpeton and its\r\nplaited teeth, as well as large size and massive development of the arm\r\nbone.]\r\n\r\nIn form, _Dendrerpeton Acadianum_ was probably lizard-like; with a\r\nbroad flat head, short stout limbs and an elongated tail; and having\r\nits skin, and more particularly that of the belly, protected by small\r\nbony plates closely overlapping each other, and arranged _en chevron_,\r\nin oblique rows meeting on the mesial line, where in front was a\r\nthoracic plate. It may have attained the length of two feet. The form\r\nof the head is not unlike that of _Baphetes_, but longer in proportion;\r\nand much resembles that of the labyrinthodont reptiles of the Trias.\r\nThe bones of the skull are sculptured as in Baphetes, but in a smaller\r\npattern.\r\n\r\nThe fore limb of the adult animal, including the toes, must have been\r\nfour or five inches in length, and is of massive proportions. The bones\r\nwere hollow, and in the case of the phalanges the bony walls were thin,\r\nso that they are often crushed flat. The humerus, or arm bone, however,\r\nwas a strong bone, with thick walls and a cancellated structure toward\r\nits extremities; still even these have sometimes yielded to the great\r\npressure to which they have been subjected. The cavity of the interior\r\nof the limb bones is usually filled with calc-spar stained with organic\r\nmatter, but showing no structure; and the inner side of the bony wall\r\nis smooth without any indication of cartilaginous matter lining it.\r\n\r\nThe vertebræ, in the external aspect of their bodies, remind one of\r\nthose of fishes, expanding toward the extremities, and being deeply\r\nhollowed by conical cavities, which appear even to meet in the centre.\r\nThere is, however, a large and flattened neural spine. The vertebræ are\r\nusually much crushed, and it is almost impossible to disengage them\r\nfrom the stone. The ribs are long and curved, showing a reptilian style\r\nof chest. The posterior limb seems to have been not larger than the\r\nanterior, perhaps smaller. The tibia, or principal bone of the fore leg\r\nis much flattened at the extremity, as in some Labyrinthodonts, and the\r\nfoot must have been broad, and probably suited for swimming, or walking\r\non soft mud, or both. That the hind limb was adapted for walking is\r\nshown, not merely by the form of the bones, but also by that of the\r\npelvis.\r\n\r\nThe external scales are thin, oblique-rhomboidal or elongated-oval,\r\nmarked with slight concentric lines, but otherwise smooth, and\r\nhaving a thickened ridge or margin, in which they resemble those of\r\nArchegosaurus, and also those of _Pholidogaster pisciformis_, described\r\nby Huxley from the Edinburgh coal field,--an animal which indeed\r\nappears in most respects to have a close affinity with _Dendrerpeton_.\r\nThe microscopic structure of the scales is quite similar to that of the\r\nother bones, and different from that of the scales of ganoid fishes,\r\nthe shape of the cells being batrachian. For other particulars of its\r\nstructure reference may be made to the papers named at the end of the\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the affinities of the creature, I think it is obvious\r\nthat it is most nearly related to the group of Lahyrinthodonts, and\r\nthat it has the same singular mixture of batrachian and reptilian\r\ncharacters which distinguish these ancient animals, and which give\r\nthem the appearance of prototypes of the reptilian class. A second\r\nand smaller species of Dendrerpeton was subsequently obtained at the\r\nJoggins, and others have been found, more especially by Fritsch, in the\r\nCarboniferous and Permian of Europe.\r\n\r\nThis ancient inhabitant of the coal swamps of Nova Scotia was, in\r\nshort, as we often find to be the case with the earliest forms of life,\r\nthe possessor of powers and structures not usually, in the modern\r\nworld, combined in a single species. It was certainly not a fish, yet\r\nits bony scales and the form of its vertebræ, and of its teeth, might,\r\nin the absence of other evidence, cause it to be mistaken for one. We\r\ncall it a Batrachian, yet its dentition, the sculpturing of the bones\r\nof its skull, which were certainly no more external plates than the\r\nsimilar bones of a crocodile, its ribs, and the structure of its limbs,\r\nremind us of the higher reptiles; and we do not know that it ever\r\npossessed gills, or passed through a larval or fish-like condition.\r\nStill, in a great many important characters, its structures are\r\nundoubtedly batrachian. It stands, in short, in the same position with\r\nthe _Lepidodendra_ and _Sigillariæ_ under whose shade it crept, which,\r\nthough placed by palæobotanists in alliance with certain modern groups\r\nof plants, manifestly differed from these in many of their characters,\r\nand occupied a different position in nature. In the coal period the\r\ndistinctions of physical and vital conditions were not well defined.\r\nDry land and water, terrestrial and aquatic plants and animals, and\r\nlower and higher forms of animal and vegetable life, are consequently\r\nnot easily separated from each other. This is no doubt a state of\r\nthings characteristic of the earlier stages of the earth's history, yet\r\nnot necessarily so; for there are some reasons, derived from fossil\r\nplants, for believing that in the preceding Devonian period there was\r\nless of this, and consequently that there may then have been a higher\r\nand more varied animal life than in the coal period.[134]\r\n\r\n[134] See the author's paper on Devonian plants, _Journal of the\r\nGeological Society_, vol. xviii. p. 328.\r\n\r\nThe dentition of _Dendrerpeton_ shows it to have been carnivorous in a\r\nhigh degree. It may have captured fishes and smaller reptiles, either\r\non land or in water, and very probably fed on dead carcases as well.\r\nIf, as seems likely, any of the footprints referred to previously\r\nbelong to this animal, it must have frequented the shores, either in\r\nsearch of garbage, or on its way to and from the waters. The occurrence\r\nof its remains in the stumps of Sigillaria, with land snails and\r\nmillipedes, shows also that it crept in the shade of the woods in\r\nsearch of food; and in noticing coprolitic matter, in a subsequent\r\npage, I shall show that remains of excrementitious substances, probably\r\nof this species, contain fragments attributable to smaller reptiles,\r\nand other animals of the land.\r\n\r\nAll the bones of _Dendrerpeton_ hitherto found, as well as those of the\r\nsmaller reptilian species hereafter described, have been obtained from\r\nthe interior of erect Sigillariæ, and all of these in one of the many\r\nbeds, which, at the Joggins, contain such remains. The thick cellular\r\ninner bark of Sigillaria was very perishable; the slender woody axis\r\nwas somewhat more durable; but near the surface of the stem, in large\r\ntrunks, there was a layer of elongated cells, or bast tissue, of\r\nconsiderable durability, and the outer bark was exceedingly dense and\r\nindestructible.[135] Hence an erect tree, partly imbedded in sediment,\r\nand subjected to the influence of the weather, became a hollow shell\r\nof bark; in the bottom of which lay the decaying remains of the woody\r\naxis, and shreds of the fibrous bark. In ordinary circumstances such\r\nhollow stems would be almost immediately filled with silt and sand,\r\ndeposited in the numerous inundations and subsidences of the coal\r\nswamps. Where, however, they remained open for a considerable time,\r\nthey would constitute a series of pitfalls, into which animals walking\r\non the surface might be precipitated; and being probably often partly\r\ncovered by remains of prostrate trunks, or by vegetation growing around\r\ntheir mouths, they would be places of retreat and abode for land snails\r\nand such creatures. When the surface was again inundated or submerged,\r\nall such animals, with the remains of those which had fallen into the\r\ndeeper pits, would be imbedded in the sediment which would then fill up\r\nthe holes. These seem to have been the precise conditions of the bed\r\nwhich has afforded all these remains.\r\n\r\n[135] See a paper by the author, on the Structures of Coal, _Journal\r\nof the Geological Society_, vol. xv.; also \"Supplement to Acadian\r\nGeology.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A reptiliferous Tree _in situ_, South Joggins, N. Scotia.\r\n\r\nThis is a sketch of a tree which afforded remains of Dendrerpeton,\r\nPupæ, etc.]\r\n\r\nThe history of a bed containing reptiliferous erect trees would thus be\r\nsomewhat as follows:--\r\n\r\nA forest or grove of the large-ribbed trees known as _Sigillariæ_, was\r\neither submerged by subsidence, or, growing on low ground, was invaded\r\nwith the muddy waters of an inundation, or successive inundations,\r\nso that the trunks were buried to the depth of several feet. The\r\nprojecting tops having been removed by subaërial decay, the buried\r\nstumps became hollow, while their hard outer bark remained intact. They\r\nthus became hollow cylinders in a vertical position, and open at top.\r\nThe surface having then become dry land, covered with vegetation, was\r\nhaunted by small quadrupeds and other land animals, which from time\r\nto time fell into the open holes, in some cases nine feet deep, and\r\ncould not extricate themselves. On their death, and the decomposition\r\nof their soft parts, their bones and other hard portions remained in\r\nthe bottom of the tree intermixed with any vegetable _débris_ or soil\r\nwashed in by rain, and which formed thin layers separating successive\r\nanimal deposits from each other. Finally, the area was again submerged\r\nor overflowed by water, bearing sand and mud. The hollow trees were\r\nfilled to the top, and their animal contents thus sealed up. At length\r\nthe material filling the trees was by pressure and the access of\r\ncementing matter hardened into stone, not infrequently harder than that\r\nof the containing beds, and the whole being tilted to an angle of 20°,\r\nand elevated into land exposed to the action of the tides and waves,\r\nthese singular coffins present themselves as stony cylinders projecting\r\nfrom the cliff or reef, and can be extracted and their contents studied.\r\n\r\nThe singular combination of accidents above detailed was, of course,\r\nof very rare occurrence, and in point of fact we know only one set of\r\nbeds at the South Joggins in which such remains so preserved occur; nor\r\nis there, so far as I am aware, any other known instance elsewhere.\r\nEven in the beds in question only a portion of the trees, about fifteen\r\nin thirty, have afforded animal remains. We have, however, thus been\r\nenabled to obtain specimens of a number of species which would probably\r\notherwise have been unknown, being less likely than others to be\r\npreserved in properly aqueous deposits. Such discoveries, on the one\r\nhand impress us with the imperfection of the geological record; on the\r\nother, they show us the singular provisions which have been made in\r\nthe course of geological time for preserving the relics of the ancient\r\nworld, and which await the industry and skill of collectors to disclose\r\ntheir hidden treasures.\r\n\r\nI may add that I believe all the trees, about thirty in number,\r\nwhich have become exposed in this bed since its discovery, have been\r\nransacked for such remains; and that while the majority have afforded\r\nsome reward for the labour, some have been far more rich than others\r\nin their contents. It is also to be observed that owing to the mode\r\nof accumulation of the mass filling the trees, the bones are usually\r\nfound scattered in every position, and those of different species\r\nintermingled; and that being often much more friable than the matrix,\r\nmuch labour is required for their development; while after all has been\r\ndone, the result is a congeries of fragments. A few specimens only\r\nhave been found, showing skeletons complete, or nearly so, and I shall\r\nendeavour to figure one or two of these by way of illustration in the\r\npresent chapter.\r\n\r\nThe beds on a level with the top of the reptiliferous erect trees\r\nare arenaceous sandstones, with numerous erect _Calamites_. I have\r\nsearched the surfaces of these beds in vain for bones or footprints of\r\nthe reptiles which must have traversed them, and which, but for hollow\r\nerect trees,\" would apparently have left no trace of their existence.\r\nOn a surface of similar character, sixty feet higher, and separated\r\nby three coals, with their accompaniments, and a very thick compact\r\nsandstone, I observed a series of footprints, which may be those of\r\n_Dendrerpeton_ or _Hylonomus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A typical Carboniferous Microsaurian, _Hylonomus Lyelli_\r\nRestoration showing dermal armour and ornaments. Skeleton restored from\r\nmeasurements of the bones of the type specimen figured at the beginning\r\nof the chapter.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies of Microsauria. Hylonomus Lyelli.\r\n\r\nIn the original reptiliferous tree discovered by Sir C. Lyell and\r\nthe writer, at the Joggins, in 1851, there were, beside the bones of\r\n_Dendrerpeton Acadianum_, some small elongated vertebræ, evidently\r\nof a different species. These were first detected by Prof. Wyman,\r\nin his examination of these specimens, and were figured, but not\r\nnamed, in the original notice of the specimens. In a subsequent visit\r\nto the Joggins I obtained from another erect stump many additional\r\nremains of these smaller reptiles, and, on careful comparison of the\r\nspecimens, was induced to refer them to three species, all apparently\r\ngenerically allied. I proposed for them the generic name _Hylonomus_,\r\n\"forest dweller.\" They were described in the Proceedings of the\r\nGeological Society for 1859, with illustrations of the teeth and other\r\ncharacteristic parts.[136] The smaller species first described I named\r\n_H. Wymani_; the next in size, that to which this article refers, and\r\nwhich was represented by a larger number of specimens, I adopted as a\r\ntype of the genus, and dedicated to Sir Charles Lyell. The third and\r\nlargest, represented only by a few fragments of a single skeleton, was\r\nnamed _H. aciedentatus_. This I had subsequently to remove to a new\r\ngenus, _Smilerpeton_.\r\n\r\n[136] _Journal of Geological Society_, vol. xvi.\r\n\r\n_Hylonomus Lyelli_ was an animal of small size. Its skull is about an\r\ninch in length, and its whole body, including the tail, could not have\r\nbeen more than six or seven inches, long. The bones appear to have\r\nbeen thin and easily separable; and even when they remain together,\r\nare so much crushed as to render the shape of the skull not easily\r\ndiscernible. They are smooth on the outer surface to the naked eye; and\r\nunder a lens show only delicate, uneven striæ and minute dots. They are\r\nmore dense and hard than those of _Dendrerpeton_, and the bone-cells\r\nare more elongated in form. The bones of the snout would seem to have\r\nbeen somewhat elongated and narrow. A specimen in my possession shows\r\nthe parietal and occipital bones, or the greater part of them, united\r\nand retaining their form. We learn from them that the brain case was\r\nrounded, and that there was a parietal foramen. There would seem\r\nalso to have been two occipital condyles, as in modern Batrachians.\r\nSeveral well-preserved specimens of the maxillary and mandibular\r\nbones have been obtained. They are smooth, or nearly so, like those\r\nof the skull, and are furnished with numerous sharp, conical teeth,\r\nanchylosed to the jaw, in a partial groove formed by the outer ridge\r\nof the bone. In the anterior part of the lower jaw there is a group of\r\nteeth larger than the others. The total number of teeth in each ramus\r\nof the lower jaw was about forty, and the number in each maxillary\r\nbone about thirty. The teeth are perfectly simple, hollow within, and\r\nwith very fine radiating tubes of ivory. The vertebræ have the bodies\r\ncylindrical or hour-glass shaped, covered with a thin, hard, bony\r\nplate, and having within a cavity of the form of two cones, attached\r\nby the apices. This cavity was completely surrounded by bone, as it\r\nis filled with stained calc-spar in the same manner as the cavities of\r\nthe limb bones. It was probably occupied by cartilage. The vertebræ\r\nwere apparently bi-concave, and are furnished with upper and lateral\r\nprocesses similar to those of small lacertian animals. The ribs are\r\nlong, curved, and at the proximal end have a shoulder and neck. They\r\nare hollow, with thin hard bony walls. The anterior limb, judging from\r\nthe fragment procured, seems to have been slender, with long toes,\r\nfour or possibly five in number. The posterior limb was longer and\r\nstronger, and attached to a pelvis so large and broad as to give the\r\nimpression that the creature enlarged considerably in size toward the\r\nposterior extremity of the body, and that it may have been in the\r\nhabit of sitting erect. The thigh bone is large and well-formed, with\r\na distinct head and trochanter, and the lower extremity flattened and\r\nmoulded into two articulating surfaces for the tibia and fibula, the\r\nfragments of which show that they were much shorter. The toes of the\r\nhind feet have been seen only in detached joints. They seem to have\r\nbeen thicker than those of the fore foot. Detached vertebræ, which seem\r\nto be caudal, have been found, and show that the tail was long and\r\nprobably not flattened. The limb bones are usually somewhat crushed and\r\nflattened, especially at their articular extremities, and this seems to\r\nhave led to the error of supposing that this flattened form was their\r\nnormal condition; there can be no doubt, however, that it is merely an\r\neffect of pressure. The limb bones present in cross section a wall of\r\ndense bone with elongated bone-cells, surrounding a cavity now filled\r\nwith brown calc-spar, and originally occupied with cartilage or marrow.\r\nI desire to specify the above points because I believe that most of the\r\ncreatures referred by Fritsch, Credner, and other European naturalists\r\nto the Microsauria are of inferior grade to Hylonomus, though admitted\r\nto present points of approximation to the true reptiles. Woodward has\r\nrecently described the remains of a Microsaurian from the English coal\r\nformation. Nothing is more remarkable in the skeleton of this creature\r\nthan the contrast between the perfect and beautiful forms of its bones,\r\nand their imperfectly ossified condition, a circumstance which raises\r\nthe question whether these specimens may not represent the young of\r\nsome reptile of larger size.\r\n\r\nThe dermal covering of this animal is represented in part by oval\r\nbony scales, which are so constantly associated with its bones that\r\nI can have no doubt that they belonged to it, being, perhaps, the\r\nclothing of its lower or abdominal parts. But the most remarkable\r\nand unexpected feature of this little creature was the beautiful and\r\nornate scaly covering of its back and sides. Modern Batrachians are\r\ncharacteristically naked, and though we know that some fossil species\r\nhad coverings below of bony scales, these seemed rather to ally them\r\nwith bony fishes. One of the specimens of Hylonomus had associated\r\nwith it a quantity of crumpled shining skin, black and carbonaceous,\r\nand which may perhaps have been tanned and so preserved by the water\r\nfilling the hollow tree impregnated with solution of tannin from the\r\nbark. This skin was covered with minute overlapping scales, which,\r\nunder the microscope, showed the structure of horn rather than of\r\nbone. Besides these ordinary scales there were bony prominences, like\r\nthose of the horned frog, on the back and shoulders, and a species of\r\nepaulettes made of long horny bristles curved downward, and apparently\r\nplaced at the edges of the shoulders. Besides these there were in front\r\nand at the side rows of pendants or lappets, all no doubt ornamented\r\nwith colouring, though now perfectly black. It may be asked what was\r\nthe use of the ornate covering, and perhaps the question raises that\r\nperplexing problem, of the use of beauty in a world where there were\r\nno animals with higher æsthetic faculties than those of Batrachians.\r\nScudder suggests a somewhat prosaic use in supposing them to be an\r\narmour against the venomous scorpions which were the contemporaries\r\nof these little reptiles, and some of them almost as large in size.\r\nBut the word \"venomous\" raises another question, for we only infer\r\nthat the scorpions were venomous from modern analogy and traces of an\r\ninflated joint at the end of the tail in some specimens. We have no\r\nabsolute certainty that the subtle and complex organic poison of the\r\nscorpion, and his beautiful injection syringe for placing it under the\r\nskin, were perfected at this early time. Thus we have in the far back\r\nCarboniferous age a creature as elaborately ornamented and protected\r\nas any of the modern lizards, and this, let it be observed, constitutes\r\nanother and important departure from that batrachian type to which\r\nthese animals are supposed to conform. I may add here that subsequently\r\nportions of skin were found, which from their size probably belonged to\r\n_Dendrerpeton_, and that these also were scaly and had lappets, though\r\nthey did not appear to have the horny tubercles and fringes. It may\r\nbe asked why such advanced characters should be found in Nova Scotia\r\nalone. The answer is that the circumstances of preservation in the\r\nerect trees were peculiar, and that only animals of purely terrestrial\r\nhabits could find access to them, whereas the remains of reptiles found\r\nin the Carboniferous elsewhere are in aqueous beds in which aquatic\r\nforms were more likely to be preserved, and in which all the soft parts\r\nwere certain to perish.\r\n\r\nIt is evident from the remains thus described, that we have in\r\n_Hylonomus Lyelli_ an animal of lacertian form, with large and stout\r\nhind limbs, and somewhat smaller fore limbs, capable of walking and\r\nrunning on land; and though its vertebræ were imperfectly ossified\r\nexternally, yet the outer walls were sufficiently strong, and their\r\narticulation sufficiently firm, to have enabled the creature to\r\nerect itself on its hind legs, or to leap. They were certainly\r\nproportionately larger and much more firmly knit than those of\r\n_Dendrerpeton_. Further, the ribs were long and much curved, and imply\r\na respiration of a higher character than that of modern Batrachians,\r\nand consequently a more highly vitalized muscular system. If to these\r\nstructural points we add the somewhat rounded skull, indicating a large\r\nbrain, we have before us a creature which, however puzzling in its\r\naffinities when anatomically considered, is clearly not to be ranked\r\nas low in the scale of creation as modern tailed Batrachians, or even\r\nas the frogs and toads. We must add to these also, as important points\r\nof difference, the bony scales with which it was armed below, and the\r\nornate apparatus of horny appendages, with which it was clad above.\r\nThese last, as described in the last section, show that this little\r\nanimal was not a squalid, slimy dweller in mud, like _Menobranchus_\r\nand its allies, but rather a beautiful and sprightly tenant of the\r\ncoal-formation thickets, vying in brilliancy, and perhaps in colouring,\r\nwith the insects which it pursued and devoured. Remains of as many\r\nas eight or ten individuals have been obtained from three erect\r\nSigillariæ, indicating that these creatures were quite abundant, as\r\nwell as active and terrestrial in their mode of life.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the affinities of this species, I think it is\r\nabundantly manifest that it presents no close relationship with any\r\nreptile hitherto discovered in the Carboniferous system, except perhaps\r\nsome of the smaller forms in the Permian of Europe, with which Credner\r\nand Fritsch have compared it. It is scarcely necessary to say that\r\nthe characters above described entirely remove this animal from the\r\nLabyrinthodonts. Equal difficulties attend the attempt to place it in\r\nany other group of recent or extinct Batrachians or proper reptiles.\r\nThe structures of the skull, and of some points in the vertebræ,\r\ncertainly resemble those of Batrachians; but, on the other hand,\r\nthe well-developed ribs, evidently adapted to enlarge the chest in\r\nrespiration, the pelvis, and the cutaneous covering, are unexampled in\r\nmodern Batrachians, and assimilate the creature to the true lizards.\r\nI have already, in my original description of the animal in 1859,\r\nexpressed my belief that _Hylonomus_ may have had lacertian affinities,\r\nbut I do not desire to speak too positively in this matter;[137] and\r\nshall content myself with stating the following alternatives as to\r\nthe probable relations of these animals, (1) They may have been true\r\nreptiles of low type, and with batrachian tendencies. (2) They may have\r\nbeen representatives of a new family of Batrachians, exhibiting in some\r\npoints lacertian affinities. (3) They may have been the young of some\r\nlarger reptile, too large and vigorous to be entrapped in the pitfalls\r\npresented by the hollow Sigillaria stumps, and in its adult state\r\nlosing the batrachian peculiarities apparent in the young. Whichever of\r\nthese views we may adopt, the fact remains, that in the structure of\r\nthis curious little creature we have peculiarities both batrachian and\r\nlacertian, in so far as our experience of modern animals is concerned.\r\nIt would, however, accord with observed facts in relation to other\r\ngroups of extinct animals, that the primitive Batrachians of the\r\ncoal period should embrace in their structures points in after times\r\nrestricted to the true reptiles. On the other hand, it would equally\r\naccord with such facts that the first-born of Lacertians should lean\r\ntowards a lower type, by which they may have been preceded. My present\r\nimpression is, that they may constitute a separate family or order, to\r\nwhich I would give the name of Microsauria, and which may be regarded\r\nas allied, on the one hand, to certain of the humbler lizards, as the\r\nGecko or Agama, and, on the other, to the tailed Batrachians.\r\n\r\n[137] I am glad to say that Fritsch and Credner now lean to the same\r\nview.\r\n\r\nIt is likely that _Hylonomus Lyelli_ was less aquatic in its habits\r\nthan _Dendrerpeton_, Its food consisted, apparently, of insects and\r\nsimilar creatures. The teeth would indicate this, and near its bones\r\nthere are portions of coprolite, containing remains of insects and\r\nmyriapods. It probably occasionally fell a prey to _Dendrerpeton_, as\r\nbones, which may have belonged either to young individuals of this\r\nspecies or to its smaller congener _H. Wymani_, are found in larger\r\ncoprolites, which may be referred with probability to _Dendrerpeton\r\nAcadianum_. This coprolitic matter, which is somewhat plentiful on\r\nsome of the surfaces in the erect trees, also informs us that the\r\nimprisoned animals may in some cases have continued to live for some\r\ntime, feeding on such animals as may have fallen into their place of\r\nconfinement, which was destined also to be their tomb. Some other\r\npoints of interest appear on the examination of this excrementitious\r\nmatter. It contains much carbonate of lime, indicating that snails or\r\nother mollusks furnished a considerable part of the food of the smaller\r\nreptiles. Some portions of it are filled with chitinous fragments,\r\nparts of millipedes or insects, but usually so broken up as scarcely to\r\nbe distinguishable. One curious exception was a part of the head of an\r\ninsect containing a portion of one of its eyes. The facets of this can\r\nbe readily seen with the microscope, and are similar to those of modern\r\ncockroaches. About 250 of these little eyes are discernible, and they\r\nmust have been much more numerous. Two points are of interest here:\r\nFirst, the perfection of the compound eye for vision in air. It had\r\nlong before, in the case of the Trilobites, been used for seeing under\r\nwater. Secondly, the great age of the still ubiquitous and aggressive\r\nfamily of the cockroaches. In point of fact the oldest known insect,\r\nthe Protoblattina of the Silurian, is one of these creatures, and they\r\nare the most abundant insects in the Carboniferous, so that if they now\r\ndispute with us the possession of our food, they may at least put in\r\nthe claim of prior occupancy of the world. In one mass a quantity of\r\nthickish crust or shell appears, which under the microscope presents a\r\nminutely tubular and laminated appearance. It may have belonged to some\r\nsmall crustacean or large scorpion on which a _Dendrerpeton_ may have\r\nbeen feeding before it fell into the pit in which it was entombed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Dolichosoma longissimum_, a serpentiform Permian\r\nBatrachian after Fritsch. This and Hylonomus are opposite or extreme\r\ntypes in regard to general form.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the reptilian species above noticed, the erect trees of\r\nCoal Mine Point have afforded several others. There is a second and\r\nsmaller species of Dendrerpeton (_D. Oweni_) and other forms belonging\r\nto the group of Microsauria of which Hylonomus is the type. A second\r\nspecies of that genus (_H. Wymani_) has already been mentioned. A\r\nsimilar creature, but of larger size and with teeth of a wedge or\r\nchisel shape, has been referred to a distinct genus, _Smilerpeton_. It\r\nseems to have been rare, and the only skeleton found is very imperfect.\r\nIts teeth are of a form that may have served even for vegetable food,\r\nas their sharp edges must have had considerable cutting power. Another\r\ncurious form of tooth appears in the genus _Hylerpeton_. It has the\r\npoints worked into oblique grooves separated by sharp edges, which\r\nmust have greatly aided in piercing tough integument. These creatures\r\nseem to have been of stout and robust build, with large limbs. Still\r\nanother generic type (_Fritschia_) is represented by a species near to\r\nHylonomus in several respects, and with long and beautifully formed\r\nlimb bones, but with the belly protected with rod-like bodies instead\r\nof scales. In this respect Hylerpeton is somewhat intermediate, having\r\nlong and narrow scales on the belly instead of the oval or roundish\r\nscales of Hylonomus. All these last-mentioned forms are Microsaurians,\r\nwith simple teeth and well-developed ribs and limbs, and smooth\r\ncranial bones. Two other species are represented by portions of single\r\nskeletons too imperfect to allow them to be certainly determined.\r\n\r\nI would emphasize here that the vertebrate animals found in the erect\r\ntrees are necessarily a selection from the most exclusively terrestrial\r\nforms, and from the smaller species of these. The numerous newt-like\r\nand serpentiform species found in the shales of the coal formation\r\ncould not find access to these peculiar repositories, nor could the\r\nlarger species of the Labyrinthodonts and their allies, even if they\r\nwere in the habit of occasionally prowling in the forests in search of\r\nprey, and this would scarcely be likely, more especially as the waters\r\nmust have afforded to them much more abundant supplies of food. Of\r\nthe numerous species figured by Fritsch, Cope and Huxley, only a few\r\napproach very near to the forms entrapped in the old hollow Sigillariæ,\r\nthough several have characters half batrachian and half reptilian.\r\n\r\n\r\nInvertebrate Air-breathers.\r\n\r\nThe coal formation rocks have afforded Land Snails, Millipedes,\r\nSpiders, Scorpions and Insects, so that all the great types of\r\ninvertebrate life which up to this day can live on land already had\r\nrepresentatives in this ancient period. Some of them, indeed, we can\r\ntrace further back, the land snails probably to the Devonian, the\r\nMillipedes to the same period, and the Scorpions and insects as far as\r\nthe Silurian. No land vertebrate is yet known, older than the Lower\r\nCarboniferous, but there is nothing known to us in physical condition,\r\nto preclude the existence of such creatures at least in the Devonian.\r\n\r\nIt would take us too far afield to attempt to notice the invertebrate\r\nland life of the Palæozoic in general. This has been done in great\r\ndetail by Dr. Scudder. I shall here limit myself to the animals found\r\nin our erect trees, and merely touch incidentally on such others as may\r\nbe connected with them.\r\n\r\nI have already mentioned the occurrence of a land-snail, a true\r\npulmonate mollusk, in the first find by Lyell and myself at Coal Mine\r\nPoint, and this was the first animal of this kind known in any rocks\r\nolder than the Purbeck formation of England. It is one of the groups\r\nof so-called Chrysalis-shells, scarcely distinguishable at first\r\nsight from some modern West Indian species, and distinctly referable\r\nto the modern genus Pupa. It was named _Pupa vetusta_, and a second\r\nand smaller species subsequently found was named _P. Bigsbyi_, and a\r\nthird of different form, and resembling the modern snails, bears the\r\nname _Zonites priscus_. The only other Palæozoic land mollusks known\r\nat present are a few species found in the coal formation of Ohio, and\r\na fragment supposed to indicate another species from the Devonian\r\nplant-beds of St. John's, New Brunswick. This last is the oldest known\r\nevidence of pulmonate snails. If we ask the precise relations of these\r\ncreatures to modern snails, it may be answered that of the two leading\r\nsubdivisions of the group of air-breathing snails (_Pulmonifera_), the\r\nOperculate, or those with a movable plate to close the mouth of the\r\nshell, and the Inoperculate, or those that are destitute of any such\r\nshelly lid or operculum to close the shell, the first has been traced\r\nno farther back than the Eocene. The second or inoperculate division,\r\nincludes some genera that are aquatic and some that are terrestrial.\r\nOf the aquatic genera no representatives are known in formations\r\nolder than the Wealden and Purbeck, and these only in Europe. The\r\nterrestrial group, or the family of the _Helicidæ_, which, singularly\r\nenough, is that which diverges farthest from the ordinary gill-bearing\r\nGasteropods, is the one which has been traced farthest back, and\r\nincludes the Palæozoic species. It is further remarkable that a very\r\ngreat gap exists in the geological history of this family. No species\r\nare known between the Carboniferous and the early Tertiary, though in\r\nthe intervening formations there are many fresh-water and estuarine\r\ndeposits in which such remains might be expected to occur. There is\r\nperhaps no reason to doubt the continuance of the Helicidæ through\r\nthis long portion of geological time, though it is probable that\r\nduring the interval the family did not increase much in the numbers\r\nof its species, more especially as it seems certain that it has its\r\nculmination in the modern period, where it is represented by very many\r\nand large species, which are dispersed over nearly all parts of our\r\ncontinents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carboniferous Land Snails.\r\n\r\n_Pupa vetusta_, Dawson, and _Conulus priscus_, Carpenter, with egg of\r\n_Pupa vetusta_--the whole considerably magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I published in 1880, in the _American Journal of\r\nScience_, a fragment of what seemed to be a land-snail, from the Middle\r\nErian plant-beds of St. John, New Brunswick (_Strophia grandava_,\r\nfigured here), but have mentioned it with some doubt in the text. Mr.\r\nG. F. Matthew has, however, recently communicated to the Royal Society\r\nof Canada a second species, found by Mr. W. I. Wilson in the same beds,\r\nand which he names _Pupa primava_. It is accompanied with a scorpion\r\nand a millipede. Thus the existence of Land Snails of the Pupa type in\r\nthe Devonian may be considered as established.]\r\n\r\nThe mode of occurrence of the Palæozoic Pulmonifera in the few\r\nlocalities where they have been found is characteristic. The earliest\r\nknown species, _Pupa vetusta_, was found, as already stated, in the\r\nmaterial filling the once hollow stem of a Sigillaria at the South\r\nJoggins in Nova Scotia, and many additional specimens have subsequently\r\nbeen obtained from similar repositories in the same locality,\r\nwhere they are associated with bones of Batrachians and remains of\r\nMillipedes. Other specimens, and also the species _Zonites priscus_,\r\nhave been found in a thin, shaly layer, containing _débris_ of plants\r\nand crusts of Cyprids, and which was probably deposited at the outlet\r\nof a small stream flowing through the coal-formation forest. The two\r\nspecies found in Illinois occur, according to Bradley, in an underclay\r\nor fossil soil which may have been the bed of a pond or estuary, and\r\nsubsequently became a forest subsoil. The Erian .species occurs in\r\nshales charged with remains of land plants, and which must consequently\r\nhave received abundant drainage from neighbouring land. It is only\r\nin such deposits that remains of true land snails can be expected to\r\noccur; though, had fresh-water or brackish water Pulmonates abounded\r\nin the Carboniferous age, their remains should have occurred in those\r\nbituminous and calcareo-bituminous shales which contain such vast\r\nquantities of _débris_ of Cyprids, Lamellibranchs and fishes of the\r\nperiod, mixed with fossil plants.\r\n\r\nThe specimen first obtained in 1887 having been taken by Sir Charles\r\nLyell to the United States, and submitted to the late Prof. Jeffries\r\nWyman, the shell in question was recognised by him and the late Dr.\r\nGould, of Boston, as a land shell. It was subsequently examined by M.\r\nDeshayes and Mr. Gwyn Jeffries, who concurred in this determination;\r\nand its microscopic structure was described by the late Prof. Quekett,\r\nof London, as similar to that of modern land shells. The single\r\nspecimen obtained on this occasion was somewhat crushed, and did\r\nnot show the aperture. Hence the hesitation as to its nature, and\r\nthe delay in naming it, though it was figured and described in the\r\npaper above cited in 1852. Better specimens showing the aperture were\r\nafterward obtained by the writer, and it was named and described by\r\nhim in his \"Air-breathers of the Coal Period,\" in 1863. Owen, in his\r\n\"Palæontology,\" subsequently proposed the generic name _Dendropupa_.\r\nThis I have hesitated to accept, as expressing a generic distinction\r\nnot warranted by the facts; but should the shell be considered to\r\nrequire a generic or sub-generic distinction, Owen's name should be\r\nadopted for it. There seems, however, nothing to prevent it from being\r\nplaced in one of the modern sub-genera of simple-lipped Pupæ. With\r\nregard to the form of its aperture, I may explain that some currency\r\nhas been given to an incorrect representation of it, through defective\r\nspecimens. In the case of delicate shells like this, imbedded in a hard\r\nmatrix, it is of course difficult to work out the aperture perfectly;\r\nand in my published figure in the \"Air-breathers,\" I had to restore\r\nsomewhat the broken specimens in my possession. This restoration,\r\nspecimens subsequently found have shown to be very exact.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, this shell seems closely allied to some modern Pupæ.\r\nPerhaps the modern species which approaches most nearly to it in form,\r\nmarkings and size, is _Macrocheilus Gossei_ from the West Indies,\r\nspecimens of which were sent to me some years ago by Mr. Bland, of New\r\nYork, with the remark that they must be very near to my Carboniferous\r\nspecies. Such edentulous species as _Pupa (Leucochila) fallax_ of\r\nEastern America very closely resemble it; and it was regarded by the\r\nlate Dr. Carpenter as probably a near ally of those species which are\r\nplaced by some European conchologists in the genus _Pupilla_.\r\n\r\n_Pupa vetusta_ has been found at three distinct levels in the coal\r\nformation of the South Joggins. The lowest is the shale above referred\r\nto. The next, 1,217 feet higher, is that of the original discovery.\r\nThe third, 800 feet higher, is in an erect Sigillaria holding no\r\nother remains. Thus, this shell has lived in the locality at least\r\nduring the accumulation of 2,000 feet of beds, including a number of\r\ncoals and erect forests, as well as beds of bituminous shales and\r\ncalcareo-bituminous shale, the growth of which must have been very slow.\r\n\r\nIn the lowest of these three horizons the shells are found, as already\r\nstated, in a thin bed of concretionary clay of dark grey colour,\r\nthough associated with reddish beds. It contains _Zonites priscus_ as\r\nwell, though this is very rare, and there are a few valves of _Cythere_\r\nand shells of _Naiadites_ as well as carbonaceous fragments, fronds of\r\nferns, _Trigonocarpa_, etc. The _Pupæ_ are mostly adult, but many very\r\nyoung shells also occur, as well as fragments of broken shells. The bed\r\nis evidently a layer of mud deposited in a pond or creek, or at the\r\nmouth of a small stream. In modern swamps multitudes of fresh-water\r\nshells occur in such places, and it is remarkable that in this case\r\nthe only Gasteropods are land shells, and these very plentiful, though\r\nonly in one bed about an inch in thickness. This would seem to imply\r\nan absence of fresh-water Pulmonifera. In the erect _Sigillariæ_ of\r\nthe second horizon the shells occur either in a sandy matrix, more or\r\nless darkened with vegetable matter, or in a carbonaceous mass composed\r\nmainly of vegetable _débris_. Except when crushed or flattened, the\r\nshells in these repositories are usually filled with brownish calcite.\r\nFrom this I infer that most of them were alive when imbedded, or at\r\nleast that they contained the bodies of the animals; and it is not\r\nimprobable that they sheltered themselves in the hollow trees, as is\r\nthe habit of many similar animals in modern forests. Their residence\r\nin these trees, as well as the characters of their embryology, are\r\nillustrated by the occurrence of their mature ova. One of those, which\r\nI have considered worth figuring, has been broken in such a way as to\r\nshow the embryo shell.\r\n\r\nThey may also have formed part of the food of the reptilian animals\r\nwhose remains occur with them. In illustration of this I have elsewhere\r\nstated that I have found as many as eleven unbroken shells of _Physa\r\nheterostropha_ in the stomach of a modern _Menobranchus_. I think it\r\ncertain, however, that both the shells and the reptiles occurring in\r\nthese trees must have been strictly terrestrial in their habits, as\r\nthey could not have found admission to the erect trees unless the\r\nground had been sufficiently dry to allow several feet of the imbedded\r\nhollow trunks to be free from water. In the highest of the three\r\nhorizons the shells occurred in an erect tree, but without any other\r\nfossils, and they had apparently been washed in along with a greyish\r\nmud.[138]\r\n\r\n[138] The discovery of the shells in this tree was made by Albert I.\r\nHill, C.E. The tree is in Group XXVI. of Division 4 of my Joggins\r\nsection. The original reptiliferous trees are in Group XV., and the\r\nlowest bed in Group VIII.\r\n\r\nIf we exclude the alleged _Palæorbis_ referred to below, all the\r\nPalæozoic Pulmonifera hitherto found are American. Since, however, in\r\nthe Carboniferous age, Batrachians, Arachnidans, Insects and Millipedes\r\noccur on both continents, it is not unlikely that ere long European\r\nspecies of land snails will be announced The species hitherto found\r\nin Eastern America are in every way strangely isolated. In the plant\r\nbeds of St. John, about 9,000 feet in thickness, and in the coal\r\nformation of the South Joggins, more than 7,000 feet in thickness,\r\nno other Gasteropods occur, nor, I believe, do any occur in the beds\r\nholding land snails in Illinois. Nor, as already stated, are any of\r\nthe aquatic Pulmonifera known in the Palæozoic. Thus, in so far as\r\nat present known, these Palæozoic snails are separated not only from\r\nany predecessors, if there were any, or successors, but from any\r\ncontemporary animals allied to them.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the land snails of the Erian and Carboniferous\r\nwere neither numerous nor important members of the faunas of those\r\nperiods. Had other species existed in any considerable numbers, there\r\nis no reason why they should not have been found in the erect trees,\r\nor in those shales which contain land plants. More especially would\r\nthe discovery of any larger species, had they existed, been likely to\r\nhave occurred. Further, what we know of the vegetation of the Palæozoic\r\nperiod would lead us to infer that it did not abound in those\r\nsucculent and nutritious leaves and fruits which are most congenial\r\nto land snails. It is to be observed, however, that we know little as\r\nyet of the upland life of the Erian or Carboniferous. The animal life\r\nof the drier parts of the low country is indeed as yet very little\r\nknown; and but for the revelations in this respect of the erect trees\r\nin one bed in the coal formation of Nova Scotia, our knowledge of the\r\nland snails and Millipedes, and also of an eminently terrestrial group\r\nof reptiles, the _Microsauria_, would have been much more imperfect\r\nthan it is. We may hope for still further revelations of this kind,\r\nand in the meantime it would be premature to speculate as to the\r\naffinities of our little group of land snails with animals either their\r\ncontemporaries or belonging to earlier or later formations, except to\r\nnote the fact of the little change of form or structure in this type\r\nof life in that vast interval of time which separates the Erian period\r\nfrom the present day.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to mention here the alleged Pulmonifera of the\r\ngenus _Palæorbis_ described by some German naturalists. These I\r\nbelieve to be worm tubes of the genus _Spirorbis_, and in fact to\r\nbe nothing else than the common _S. carbonarius_ or _S. pusillus_\r\nof the coal formation. The history of this error may be stated\r\nthus. The eminent palæobotanists Germar, Goeppert and Geinitz have\r\nreferred the _Spirorbis_, so common in the Coal measures to the fungi,\r\nunder the name _Gyromyces_, and in this they have been followed\r\nby other naturalists, though as long ago as 1868 I had shown that\r\nthis little organism is not only a calcareous shell, attached by\r\none side to vegetable matters and shells of mollusks, but that it\r\nhas the microscopic structure characteristic of modern shells of\r\nthis type.[139] More recently Van Beneden, Cænius, and Goldenberg,\r\nperceiving that the fossil is really a calcareous shell, but\r\napparently unaware of the observations made in this country by myself\r\nand Mr. Lesquereux, have held the _Spirorbis_ to be a pulmonate mollusk\r\nallied to _Planorbis_, and have supposed that its presence on fossil\r\nplants is confirmatory of this view, though the shells are attached\r\nby a flattened side to these plants, and are also found attached to\r\nshells of bivalves of the genus _Naiadites_. Mr. R. Etheridge, jun.,\r\nof the Geological Survey of Great Britain, has summed up the evidence\r\nas to the true nature of these probably brackish-water shells, and\r\nhas revised and added to the species, in a series of articles in the\r\n_Geological Magazine_ of London, vol. viii.\r\n\r\n[139] \"Acadian Geology,\" 2nd edition, p. 205.\r\n\r\nThe erect trees of Coal Mine Point are rich in remains of Millipedes.\r\nThe first of these (_Xylobius Sigillariæ_), which was the first known\r\nPalæozoic Myriapod, was described by me from specimens found in a\r\ntree extracted in 1852, and this, with a number of other remains\r\nsubsequently found, was afterwards placed in the hands of Dr.\r\nScudder, who has recognised in the material submitted to him eight\r\nspecies belonging to three genera (_Xylobius_, _Archiulus_, and\r\n_Amynilyspes_). These animals in all probability haunted these trees\r\nto feed on the decaying wood and other vegetable matter, and were\r\nundoubtedly themselves the prey of the Microsaurians. Though these\r\nwere the earliest known, their discovery was followed by that of many\r\nother species in Europe and America, and some of them as old as the\r\nDevonian.[140]\r\n\r\n[140] The two first-named genera from the erect trees, according to\r\nScudder, belong to an extinct family of Millipedes, which he names\r\nArchiulidæ, and places with other Carboniferous genera in the order\r\n_Archipolypoda_. The third belongs to family Euphoberidæ. Proc. R. S.\r\nof London, 1892.\r\n\r\nThe only other remains of Air-breathers found in the erect trees\r\nbelong to Scorpions, of which some fragments remain in such a state\r\nas to make it probable that they have been partially devoured by the\r\nimprisoned reptiles. No remains of any aquatic animals have been found\r\nin these trees. The Scorpions are referred by Scudder to three species\r\nbelonging to two genera.[141]\r\n\r\n[141] _Mazonia Acadica_, and a second species of _Mazonia_, with\r\nfragments of a third species, generally distinct. Proceedings Royal\r\nSociety of London, 1892.\r\n\r\nIn the previous paper we have considered the mode of accumulation\r\nof Coal, and it may be useful here to note the light thrown on this\r\nsubject by the Air-breathers of the coal formation and their mode of\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nIn no part of the world are the coal measures better developed, or\r\nmore fully exposed, than in the coast sections of Nova Scotia and Cape\r\nBreton; and in these, throughout their whole thickness, no indication\r\nhas been found of any of the marine fossils of the Lower Carboniferous\r\nLimestone. Abundant remains of fishes occur, but these may have\r\nfrequented estuaries, streams and ponds, and the greater part of them\r\nare small ganoids which, like the modern _Lepidosteus_ and _Amia_, may\r\nhave been specially fitted by their semi-reptilian respiration, for\r\nthe impure waters of swampy districts. Bivalve mollusks also abound;\r\nbut these are all of the kinds to which I have given the generic name\r\n_Naiadites_, and Mr. Salter those of _Anthracomya_ and _Anthracoptera_.\r\nThese shells are all distinct from any known in the marine limestones.\r\nTheir thin edentulous valves, their structure consisting of a wrinkled\r\nepidermis, a thin layer of prismatic shell and an inner layer of\r\nimperfectly pearly shell, all remind us of the Anodons and Unios.\r\nA slight notch in front concurs with their mode of occurrence in\r\nrendering it probable that, like mussels in modern estuaries, they\r\nattached themselves to floating or sunken timber. They are thus\r\nremoved, both in structure and habit, from truly marine species; and\r\nmay have been fresh-water or brackish-water mussels closely allied to\r\nmodern Unios.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Carboniferous Millipedes, _Xylobius Sigillariæ_, Dawson\r\n(_a, c_), and _Archiulus xylobioides_, Scudder (_b_).\r\n\r\nCarboniferous Cockroach.--_Blattina Bretonensis_, Sc.\r\n\r\nCarboniferous Scorpion.--_Anthracomartus Carbonarius_, abdominal\r\nsegments.]\r\n\r\nThe crustaceans (_Eurypterus_, _Diplostylus_, _Cyprids_), and the\r\nworm shell (_Spirorbis_) found with them, are not necessarily marine,\r\nthough some of them belonged probably to brackish water, and they have\r\nnot yet been found in those carboniferous beds deposited in the open\r\nsea. There is thus in the whole thickness of the middle coal measures\r\nof Nova Scotia a remarkable absence at least of open sea animals; and\r\nif, as is quite probable, the sea inundated at intervals the areas of\r\ncoal accumulation, the waters must have been shallow, and to a great\r\nextent land-locked, so that brackish-water rather than marine animals\r\ninhabited them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are in these coal measures abundant evidences\r\nof land surfaces; and subaërial decay of vegetable matter in large\r\nquantity is proved by the occurrence of the mineral charcoal of the\r\ncoal itself, as I have elsewhere shown.[142] The erect trees which\r\noccur at so many levels also imply subaërial decay. A tree imbedded in\r\nsediment and remaining under water, could not decay so as to become\r\nhollow and deposit the remains of its wood in the state of mineral\r\ncharcoal within the hollow bark. Yet this is the case with the greater\r\npart of the erect Sigillariæ which occur at more than twenty levels in\r\nthe Joggins section. Nor could such hollow trunks become repositories\r\nfor millipedes, snails and reptiles, if under water. On the other hand,\r\nif, as seems necessary to explain the character of the reptiliferous\r\nerect trees, these remained dry, or nearly so, in the interior, this\r\nwould imply not merely a soil out of water, but comparatively well\r\ndrained; as would indeed always be the case, when a flat resting on a\r\nsandy subsoil was raised several feet above the level of the water.\r\nFurther, though the peculiar character of the roots of _Sigillariæ_\r\nand _Calamites_ may lend some countenance to the supposition that they\r\ncould grow under water, or in water-soaked soils, this will not apply\r\nto coniferous trees, to ferns, and other plants, which are found under\r\ncircumstances which show that they grew with the _Sigillariæ_.\r\n\r\n[142] _Journal of Geological Survey_, vol. xv.\r\n\r\nIn the coal measures of Nova Scotia, therefore, while marine conditions\r\nare absent, there are ample evidences of fresh-water or brackish-water\r\nconditions, and of land surfaces, suitable for the air-breathing\r\nanimals of the period. Nor do I believe that the coal measures of Nova\r\nScotia were exceptional in this respect. It is true that in Great\r\nBritain evidences of marine life do occur in the coal measures; but\r\nnot, so far as I am aware, in circumstances which justify the inference\r\nthat the coal is of marine origin. Alternations of marine and land\r\nremains, and even mixtures of these, are frequent in modern submarine\r\nforests. When we find, as at Fort Lawrence in Nova Scotia, a modern\r\nforest rooted in upland soil forty feet below high-water mark,[143]\r\nand covered with mud containing living Tellinas and Myas, we are not\r\njustified in inferring that this forest grew in the sea. We rather\r\ninfer that subsidence has occurred. In modern salt marshes it is not\r\nunusual to find every little runnel or pool full of marine shell\r\nfish, while in the higher parts of the marsh land plants are growing;\r\nand in such places the deposit formed must contain a mixture of land\r\nplants and marine animals with salt grasses and herbage--the whole _in\r\nsitu_.[144]\r\n\r\n[143] _Journal of Geological Society_, vol. xi.\r\n\r\n[144] In the marshes at the mouth of Scarborough River, in Maine,\r\nchannels not more than a foot wide, and far from the sea, are full of\r\nMussels and Myæ; and in little pools communicating with these channels\r\nthere are often many young _Limuli_, which seem to prefer such places,\r\nand the cast-off shells and other remains of which may become imbedded\r\nin mud and mixed with land plants, just as in the shales of the coal\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nThese considerations serve, I think, to explain all the apparently\r\nanomalous associations of coal plants with marine fossils; and I do\r\nnot know any other arguments of apparent weight that can be adduced\r\nin favour of the marine or even aquatic origin of coal, except such\r\nas are based on misconceptions of the structure and mode of growth of\r\nsigillaroid trees and of the stratigraphical relations of the coal\r\nitself.[145] It is to be observed, however, that while I must maintain\r\nthe essentially terrestrial character of the ordinary coal and of\r\nits plants, I have elsewhere admitted that cannel coals and earthy\r\nbitumen present evidences of subaquatic deposition; and have also\r\nabundantly illustrated the facts that the coal plants grew on swampy\r\nflats, liable not only to river inundations, but also to subsidence and\r\nsubmergence.[146] In the oscillation of these conditions it is evident\r\nthat _Sigillariæ_ and their contemporaries must often have been placed\r\nin conditions unfavourable or fatal to them, and when their remains\r\nare preserved to us in these conditions, we may form very incorrect\r\ninferences as to their mode of life. Further, it is to be observed that\r\nthe conditions of submergence and silting up which were favourable to\r\nthe preservation of specimens of _Sigillariæ_ as fossils, must have\r\nbeen precisely those which were destructive to them as living plants;\r\nand on the contrary, that the conditions in which these forests may\r\nhave flourished for centuries must have been those in which there was\r\nlittle chance of their remains being preserved to us, in any other\r\ncondition at least than that of coal, which reveals only to careful\r\nmicroscopic examination the circumstances, whether aërial or aquatic,\r\nunder which it was formed.\r\n\r\n[145] It is unfortunate that few writers on this subject have combined\r\nwith the knowledge of the geological features of the coal a sufficient\r\nacquaintance with the phenomena of modern marshes and swamps, and with\r\nthe conditions necessary for the growth of plants such as those of the\r\ncoal. It would be easy to show, were this a proper place to do so, that\r\nthe \"swells,\" \"rock faults,\" splitting of beds, and other appearances\r\nof coal seams quite accord with the theory of swamp accumulation; that\r\nthe plants associated with _Sigillariæ_ could not have lived with\r\ntheir roots immersed in salt water; that the chemical character of\r\nthe underclays implies drainage and other conditions impossible under\r\nthe sea; that the composition and minute structure of the coal are\r\nincompatible with the supposition that it is a deposit from water, and\r\nespecially from salt water; and that it would be more natural to invoke\r\nwind driftage as a mode of accumulation for some of the sandstones,\r\nthan water driftage for the formation of the coal. At the same time it\r\nis pretty certain that such beds as the cannels and earthy bitumens\r\nwhich appear to consist of finely comminuted vegetable matter, without\r\nmineral charcoal, may have been deposits of muck in shallow lakes or\r\nlagoons.\r\n\r\n[146] _Journal of Geol. Socy._, vols. x. and xv., and \"Acadian Geology.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also noticeable that, in conditions such as those of the coal\r\nformation, it would be likely that some plants would be specially\r\nadapted to occupy newly emerged flats and places liable to inundation\r\nand silting up. I believe that many of the Sigillariæ, and still more\r\neminently the _Calamites_, were suitable to such stations. There\r\nis direct evidence that the nuts named Trigonocarpa were drifted\r\nextensively by water over submerged flats of mud. Many _Cardiocarpa_\r\nwere winged seeds which may have drifted in the air. The Calamites\r\nmay, like modern _Equiseta_, have produced spores with elaters capable\r\nof floating them in the wind. One of the thinner coals at the Joggins\r\nis filled with spores or spore cases that seem to have carried\r\nhairs on their surfaces, and may have been suited to such a mode of\r\ndissemination. I have elsewhere proved[147] that at least some species\r\nof _Calamites_ were, by their mode of growth, admirably fitted for\r\ngrowing amid accumulating sediment, and for promoting its accumulation.\r\n\r\n[147] \"Acadian Geology,\" chapter on Coal Plants.\r\n\r\nThe reptiles of the coal formation are probably the oldest known to us,\r\nand possibly, though this we cannot affirm, the highest products of\r\ncreation in this period. Supposing, for the moment, that they are the\r\nhighest animals of their time, and, what is perhaps less likely, that\r\nthose which we know are a fair average of the rest, we have the curious\r\nfact that they are all carnivorous, and the greater part of them fitted\r\nto find food in the water as well as on the land. The plant feeders of\r\nthe period, on the land at least, are all invertebrates, as snails,\r\nmillipedes, and perhaps insects. The air-breathing vertebrates are not\r\nintended to consume the exuberant vegetable growth, but to check the\r\nincrease of its animal enemies. Plant life would thus seem to have had\r\nin every way the advantage. The millipedes probably fed only on roots\r\nand decaying substances, the snails on the more juicy and succulent\r\nplants growing in the shadow of the woods, and the great predominance\r\nof the family of cockroaches among carboniferous insects points to\r\nsimilar conclusions as to that class. While, moreover, the vegetation\r\nof the coal swamps was most abundant, it was not, on the whole, of a\r\ncharacter to lead us to suppose that it supported many animals. Our\r\nknowledge of the flora of the coal swamps is sufficiently complete to\r\nexclude from them any abundance of the higher phænogamous plants. We\r\nknow little, it is true, of the flora of the uplands of the period; but\r\nwhen we speak of the coal-formation land, it is to the flats only that\r\nwe refer. The foliage of the plants on these flats with the exception\r\nof that of the ferns, was harsh and meagre, and there seem to have been\r\nno grasses or other nutritious herbaceous plants. These are wants of\r\nthemselves likely to exclude many of the higher forms of herbivorous\r\nlife. On the other hand, there was a profusion of large nut-like seeds,\r\nwhich in a modern forest would probably have afforded subsistence to\r\nsquirrels and similar animals. The pith and thick soft bark of many\r\nof the trees must at certain seasons have contained much nutritive\r\nmatter, while there was certainly sufficient material for all those\r\ninsects whose larvæ feed on living and dead timber, as well as for\r\nthe creatures that in turn prey on them. It is remarkable that there\r\nseem to have been no vertebrate animals fitted to avail themselves of\r\nthese vast stores of food. The question: \"What may have fed on all\r\nthis vegetation?\" was never absent from my mind in all my explorations\r\nof the Nova Scotia coal sections; but no trace of any creature other\r\nthan those already mentioned has ever rewarded my search. In Nova\r\nScotia it would seem that a few snails, gally-worms, and insects\r\nwere the sole links of connection between the plant creation and\r\nair-breathing vertebrates. Is this due to the paucity of the fauna, or\r\nthe imperfection of the record? The fact that a few erect stumps have\r\nrevealed nearly all the air-breathers yet found, argues strongly for\r\nthe latter cause; but there are some facts bearing on the other side.\r\n\r\nA gally-worm, if, like its modern relatives, hiding in crevices of\r\nwood in forests, was one of the least likely animals to be found in\r\naqueous deposits. The erect trees gave it its almost sole chance of\r\npreservation. _Pupa vetusta_ is a small species, and its shell very\r\nthin and fragile, while it probably lived among thick vegetation.\r\nFurther, the measures 2,000 feet thick, separating the lowest and\r\nhighest beds in which it occurs, include twenty-one coal seams, having\r\nan aggregate thickness of about twenty feet, three beds of bituminous\r\nlimestone of animal origin, and perhaps twenty beds holding _Stigmaria_\r\n_in situ_, or _erect_ _Sigillariæ_ and _Calamites_. The lapse of time\r\nimplied by this succession of beds, many of them necessarily of very\r\nslow deposition, must be very great, though it would be mere guess work\r\nto attempt to resolve it into years. Yet long though this interval must\r\nhave been, _Pupa vetusta_ lasted without one iota of change through\r\nit all; and, more remarkable still, was not accompanied by more than\r\ntwo other species of its family. Where so many specimens occur, and in\r\nsituations so diverse, without any additional species, the inference\r\nis strong that no other of similar habits existed. If in any of those\r\nsubtropical islands, whose climate and productions somewhat resemble\r\nthose of the coal period, after searching in and about decaying trees,\r\nand also on the bars upon which rivers and lakes drifted their burdens\r\nof shells, we should find only three species, but one of these in very\r\ngreat numbers, we would surely conclude that other species, if present,\r\nwere very rare.\r\n\r\nAgain, footprints referable to _Dendrerpeton_, or similar animals,\r\noccur in the lower Carboniferous beds below the marine limestones, in\r\nthe middle coal measures, and in the upper coal formation, separated\r\nby a thickness of beds which may be estimated at 15,000 feet, and\r\ncertainly representing a vast lapse of time. Did we know the creature\r\nby these impressions alone, we might infer its continued existence for\r\nall this great length of time; but when we also find its bones in the\r\nprincipal repositories of reptile remains, and in company with the\r\nother creatures found with it, we satisfy ourselves that of them all it\r\nwas the most likely to have left its trail in the mud flats. We thus\r\nhave reason to conclude that it existed alone during this period, in so\r\nfar as its especial kind of habitat was concerned; though there lived\r\nwith it other reptiles, some of which, haunting principally the woods,\r\nand others the water, were less likely to leave impressions of their\r\nfootprints. These may be but slight indications of truth, but they\r\nconvey strong impressions of the persistence of species, and also of\r\nthe paucity of species belonging to these tribes at the time.\r\n\r\nIf we could affirm that the Air-breathers of the coal period were\r\nreally the first species of their families, they might acquire\r\nadditional interest by their bearing on this question of origin of\r\nspecies. We cannot affirm this; but it may be a harmless and not\r\nuninstructive play of fancy to suppose for a moment that they actually\r\nare so, and to inquire on this supposition as to the mode of their\r\nintroduction. Looking at them from this point of view, we shall first\r\nbe struck with the fact that they belong to all of the three great\r\nleading types of animals which include our modern Air-breathers the\r\nVertebrates, the Arthropods, and the Mollusks. We have besides to\r\nconsider in this connection that the breathing organs of an insect are\r\nair tubes opening laterally (tracheæ), those of a land snail merely a\r\nmodification of the chamber which in marine species holds the gills,\r\nwhile those of the reptiles represent the air bladder of the fishes.\r\nThus, in the three groups the breathing organs are quite distinct in\r\ntheir nature and affinities. This at once excludes the supposition that\r\nthey can all have been derived from each other within the limits of the\r\ncoal period. No transmutationist can have the hardihood to assert the\r\nconvertibility, by any direct method, of a snail into a millipede or\r\nan insect, or of either into a reptile. The plan of structure in these\r\ncreatures is not only different, but contrasted in its most essential\r\nfeatures. It would be far more natural to suppose that these animals\r\nsprang from aquatic species of their respective types. We should then\r\nseek for the ancestors of the snail in aquatic Gasteropods, for those\r\nof the millipede in worms or Crustaceans, and for those of the reptiles\r\nin the fishes of the period. It would be easy to build up an imaginary\r\nseries of stages, on the principle of natural selection, whereby these\r\nresults might be effected; but the hypothesis would be destitute of\r\nany support from fact, and would be beset by more difficulties than it\r\nremoves. Why should the result of the transformation of water-snails\r\nbreathing by gills be a _Pupa ?_ Would it not much more likely be an\r\n_Auricula_ or a _Limnea ?_ It will not solve this difficulty to say\r\nthat the intermediate forms became extinct, and so are lost. On the\r\ncontrary, they exist to this day, though they were not, in so far\r\nas we know, introduced so early. But negative evidence must not be\r\nrelied on; the record is very imperfect, and such creatures may have\r\nexisted, though unknown to us. It may be answered that they could not\r\nhave existed in any considerable numbers, else some of their shells\r\nwould have appeared in the coal-formation beds, so rich in crustaceans\r\nand bivalve mollusks. Further, the little Pupa remained unchanged\r\nduring a very long time, and shows no tendency to resolve itself into\r\nanything higher, or to descend to anything lower, while in the lowest\r\nbed in which it occurs it is associated with a round snail of quite\r\ndifferent type. Here, if anywhere, in what appears to be the first\r\nintroduction of air-breathing invertebrates, we should be able to find\r\nthe evidences of transition from the gills of the Prosobranchiate\r\nand the Crustacean to the air sac of the Pulmonate and the tracheæ of\r\nthe millipede. It is also to be observed that many other structural\r\nchanges are involved, the aggregate of which makes a Pulmonate or a\r\nmillipede different in every particular from its nearest allies among\r\ngill-bearing Gasteropods or Crustaceans.\r\n\r\nIt may be said, however, that the links of connection between the coal\r\nreptiles and fishes are better established. All the known coal reptiles\r\nhave leanings to the fishes in certain characters; and in some, as\r\nin _Archegosaurus_, these are very close. Still the interval to be\r\nbridged over is wide, and the differences are by no means those which\r\nwe should expect. Were the problem given to convert a ganoid fish into\r\nan _Archegosaurus_ or _Dendrerpeton_, we should be disposed to retain\r\nunchanged such characters as would be suited to the new habits of the\r\ncreature, and to change only those directly related to the objects\r\nin view. We should probably give little attention to differences in\r\nthe arrangement of skull bones, in the parts of the vertebræ, in the\r\nexternal clothing, in the microscopic structure of the bone, and other\r\npeculiarities for serving similar purposes by organs on a different\r\nplan, which are so conspicuous so soon as we pass from the fish to the\r\nBatrachian. It is not, in short, an improvement of the organs of the\r\nfish that we witness so much as the introduction of new organs.[148]\r\nThe foot of the batrachian bears, perhaps, as close a relation to the\r\nfin of the fish as the screw of one steamship to the paddle wheel\r\nof another, or as the latter to a carriage wheel; and can be just\r\nas rationally supposed to be not a new instrument, but the old one\r\nchanged. In this connection even a footprint in the sand startles us as\r\nmuch as that of Friday did Robinson Crusoe. We see five fingers and\r\ntoes, and ask how this numerical arrangement started at once from fin\r\nrays of fishes all over the world; and how it has continued unchanged\r\ntill now, when it forms the basis of our decimal arithmetic.\r\n\r\n[148] An ingenious attempt by Prof. Cope, to deduce the batrachian foot\r\nfrom the fins of certain carboniferous fishes, will be found in the\r\n_Proceedings of the Philos. Academy of Philadelphia_ for the present\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nAgain, our reptiles of the coal do not constitute a continuous series,\r\nand belong to a great number of distinct genera and families, nor\r\nis it possible that they can all, except at widely different times,\r\nhave originated from the same source. It either happened, for some\r\nunknown reason, that many kinds of fishes put on the reptilian guise\r\nin the same period, or else the vast lapse of ages required for the\r\nproduction of a reptile from a fish must be indefinitely increased for\r\nthe production of many dissimilar reptiles from each other; or, on the\r\nother hand, we must suppose that the limit between the fish and reptile\r\nbeing once overpassed, a facility for comparatively rapid changes\r\nbecame the property of the latter. Either supposition would, I think,\r\ncontradict such facts bearing on the subject as are known to us.\r\n\r\nWe commenced with supposing that the reptiles of the Coal might\r\npossibly be the first of their family, but it is evident from the\r\nabove considerations, that on the doctrine of natural selection, the\r\nnumber and variety of reptiles in this period would imply that their\r\npredecessors in this form must have existed from a time as early as\r\nany in which even fishes are known to exist; so that if we adopt any\r\nhypothesis of derivation, it would probably be necessary to have\r\nrecourse to that which supposes at particular periods a sudden and\r\nas yet unaccountable transmutation of one form into another; a view\r\nwhich, in its remoteness from anything included under ordinary natural\r\nlaws, does not materially differ from that currently received idea of\r\ncreative intervention, with which, in so far as our coal reptiles can\r\ninform us, we are for the present satisfied.\r\n\r\nThere is one other point which strikes the naturalist in considering\r\nthese animals, and which has a certain bearing on such hypothesis.\r\nIt is the combination of various grades of reptilian types in these\r\nancient creatures. It has been well remarked by Hugh Miller, and more\r\nfully by Agassiz, that this is characteristic of the first appearance\r\nof new groups of animals. Now selection, as it acts in the hands of the\r\nbreeder, tends to specialization; and natural selection, if there is\r\nsuch a thing, is supposed to tend in the same direction. But when some\r\ndistinctly new form is to be introduced, an opposite tendency seems to\r\nprevail, a sort of aggregation in one species of characters afterward\r\nto be separated and manifested in distinct groups of creatures. The\r\nintroduction of such new types also tends to degrade and deprive of\r\ntheir higher properties previously existing groups of lower rank. It is\r\neasy to perceive in all this, law and order, in that higher sense in\r\nwhich these terms express the will and plan of the Supreme Mind, but\r\nnot in that lower sense in which they represent the insensate operation\r\nof blind natural forces.\r\n\r\n  References:--\"Air-breathers of the Coal Period.\" Montreal, 1886.\r\n    Papers on Reptiles, etc., in South Joggins Coal Field, _Journal\r\n    of Geological Society of London_, vols. ix. x. xi. xvi.

He noticed with the greatest\r\ninterest the trails of worms, insects, and various other creatures, and\r\nthe footprints of birds on the surface of the soft red tidal mud of\r\nthe Bay of Fundy, and subsequently published his notes on the various\r\nmarkings in these deposits in his \"Travels in North America,\" and in a\r\npaper presented to the Geological Society of London. I well remember\r\nhow, in walking along the edge of the muddy shore, he stopped to watch\r\nthe efforts of a grasshopper that had leaped into the soft ooze, and\r\nwas painfully making a most complicated trail in his effort to escape.\r\nSir Charles remarked that if it had been so fortunate as to make these\r\nstrange and complicated tracks on some old formation now hardened into\r\nstone and buried in the earth, it might have given occasion to much\r\nlearned discussion.\r\n\r\nAt a later period I found myself perplexed in the study of fossil\r\nplants by the evident errors of many palæobotanists unacquainted with\r\nmodern markings on shores, in referring all kinds of mere markings\r\nto the vegetable kingdom, and especially to the group of fucoids or\r\nseaweeds, which had become a refuge for destitute objects not referable\r\nto other kinds of fossils. It thus became necessary to collect and\r\nstudy these objects, as they existed in rocks of different ages, and\r\nto compare them with the examples afforded by the modern beach; and\r\nperhaps no locality could have afforded better opportunities for this\r\nthan the immense tidal flats of the finest mud left bare by the great\r\ntides of the Bay of Fundy in Nova Scotia. At a more recent period\r\nstill, the subject has come into great prominence in Europe, and if we\r\nare to gauge its importance by the magnitude of the costly illustrated\r\nworks devoted to it by Delgado, Saporta, Nathorst, and others, and the\r\nmultitude of scattered papers in scientific periodicals, we should\r\nregard it as one of the most salient points in Geology.[149]\r\n\r\n[149] _Journal of London Geological Society_, vol. vii. p. 239.\r\n\r\nIt may be well further to introduce the subject by a few extracts from\r\nLyell's work above referred to.\r\n\r\n\"The sediment with which the waters are charged is extremely fine,\r\nbeing derived from the destruction of cliffs of red sandstone and\r\nshale, belonging chiefly to the coal measures. On the borders of even\r\nthe smallest estuaries communicating with a bay, in which the tides\r\nrise sixty feet and upwards, large areas are laid dry for nearly a\r\nfortnight between the spring and neap tides, and the mud is then baked\r\nin summer by a hot sun, so that it becomes solidified and traversed by\r\ncracks caused by shrinkage. Portions of the hardened mud may then be\r\ntaken up and removed without injury. On examining the edges of each\r\nslab we observe numerous layers, formed by successive tides, usually\r\nvery thin, sometimes only one-tenth of an inch thick, of unequal\r\nthickness, however, because, according to Dr. Webster, the night tides\r\nrising a foot higher than the day tides throw down more sediment. When\r\na shower of rain falls, the highest portion of the mud-covered flat\r\nis usually too hard to receive any impressions; while that recently\r\nuncovered by the tide, near the water's edge, is too soft. Between\r\nthese areas a zone occurs almost as smooth and even as a looking-glass,\r\non which every drop forms a cavity of circular or oval form; and if the\r\nshower be transient, these pits retain their shape permanently, being\r\ndried by the sun, and being then too firm to be effaced by the action\r\nof the succeeding tide, which deposits upon them a new layer of mud.\r\nHence we find, on splitting open a slab an inch or more thick, on the\r\nupper surface of which the marks of recent rain occur, that an inferior\r\nlayer, deposited perhaps ten or fourteen tides previously, exhibits\r\non its under surface perfect casts of rain prints which stand out in\r\nrelief, the moulds of the same being seen in the layer below.\"\r\n\r\nAfter mentioning that a continued shower of rain obliterates the more\r\nregular impressions, and produces merely a blistered or uneven surface,\r\nand describing minutely the characteristics of true rain marks in their\r\nmost perfect state, Sir Charles adds:--\r\n\r\n\"On some of the specimens the winding tubular tracks of worms are seen,\r\nwhich have been bored just beneath the surface. Sometimes the worms\r\nhave dived beneath the surface, and then re-appeared. Occasionally the\r\nsame mud is traversed by the footprints of birds (_Tringa minuta_),\r\nand of musk-rats, minks, dogs, sheep and cats. The leaves also of the\r\nelm, maple and oak trees have been scattered by the winds over the soft\r\nmud, and having been buried under the deposits of succeeding tides, are\r\nfound on dividing the layers. When the leaves themselves are removed,\r\nvery faithful impressions, not only of their outline, but of their\r\nminutest veins, are left imprinted on the clay.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a minor illustration of that application of recent causes to\r\nexplain ancient effects of which the great English geologist was the\r\napostle and advocate, and which he so admirably practised in his own\r\nwork. It is also an illustration of the fact that things the most\r\nperishable and evanescent may, when buried in the crust of the earth,\r\nbecome its most durable monuments. Footprints in the sand of the tidal\r\nshore are in the ordinary course of events certain to be obliterated\r\nby the next tide; but when carefully filled up by gently deposited new\r\nmaterial, and hardened into stone, there is no limit to their duration.\r\n\r\nLet us inquire how this may take place, and the tidal flats of the Bay\r\nof Fundy and Basin of Minas may supply us with the information desired.\r\nIn the upper parts of the Bay of Fundy and its estuaries the rise and\r\nfall of tide, as is well known, are excessive. I quote the following\r\ndescription of the appearance they present from a work of earlier\r\ndate:--\r\n\r\n\"The tide wave that sweeps to the north-east, along the Atlantic\r\ncoast of the United States, entering the funnel-like mouth of the Bay\r\nof Fundy, becomes compressed and elevated, as the sides of the bay\r\ngradually approach each other, until in the narrower parts the water\r\nruns at the rate of six or seven miles per hour, and the vertical rise\r\nof the tide amounts to sixty feet or more. In Cobequid and Chiegnecto\r\nBays these tides, to an unaccustomed spectator, have rather the aspect\r\nof some rare convulsion of nature than of an ordinary daily phenomenon.\r\nAt low tide wide flats of brown mud are seen to extend for miles, as if\r\nthe sea had altogether retired from its bed; and the distant channel\r\nappears as a mere strip of muddy water. At the commencement of flood a\r\nslight ripple is seen to break over the edge of the flats. It rushes\r\nswiftly forward, and, covering the lower flats almost instantaneously,\r\ngains rapidly on the higher swells of mud, which appear as if they were\r\nbeing dissolved in the turbid waters. At the same time the torrent\r\nof red water enters all the channels, creeks and estuaries; surging,\r\nwhirling, and foaming, and often having in its front a white, breaking\r\nwave, or 'bore,' which runs steadily forward, meeting and swallowing up\r\nthe remains of the ebb still trickling down the channels. The mud flats\r\nare soon covered; and then, as the stranger sees the water gaining with\r\nnoiseless and steady rapidity on the steep sides of banks and cliffs,\r\na sense of insecurity creeps over him, as if no limit could be set\r\nto the advancing deluge. In a little time, however, he sees that the\r\nfiat, 'Hitherto shalt thou come, and no farther,' has been issued to\r\nthe great bay tide: its retreat commences, and the waters rush back as\r\nrapidly as they entered.\r\n\r\n\"The rising tide sweeps away the fine material from every exposed\r\nbank and cliff, and becomes loaded with mud and extremely fine sand,\r\nwhich, as it stagnates at high water, it deposits in a thin layer on\r\nthe surface of the flats. This layer, which may vary in thickness from\r\na quarter of an inch to a quarter of a line, is coarser and thicker\r\nat the outer edge of the flats than nearer the shore; and hence these\r\nflats, as well as the marshes, are usually higher near the channels\r\nthan at their inner edge. From the same cause,--the more rapid\r\ndeposition of the coarser sediment,--the lower side of each layer is\r\narenaceous, and sometimes dotted over with films of mica, while the\r\nupper side is fine and slimy, and when dry has a shining and polished\r\nsurface. The falling tide has little effect on these deposits, and\r\nhence the gradual growth of the flats, until they reach such a height\r\nthat they can be overflowed only by the high spring tides. They then\r\nbecome natural or salt marsh, covered with the coarse grasses and\r\n_carices_ which grow in such places. So far the process is carried on\r\nby the hand of nature; and before the colonization of Nova Scotia,\r\nthere were large tracts of this grassy alluvium to excite the wonder\r\nand delight of the first settlers on the shores of the Bay of Fundy.\r\nMan, however, carries the land-making process farther; and by diking\r\nand draining, excludes the sea water, and produces a soil capable of\r\nyielding for an indefinite period, without manure, the most valuable\r\ncultivated grains and grasses.\"\r\n\r\nThe mud of these great tidal flats is at the surface of a red colour,\r\nand so fine that when the tide leaves it and its surface becomes dry,\r\nit shines in the sun as if polished. It is thus capable of taking\r\nthe finest impressions. When the tide is in, numerous small fish of\r\nvarious species occupy the ground and may leave marks of their fins\r\nand tails as they gambol or seek their food. Shell fishes, worms, and\r\nCrustaceans scramble over the same surface, or make burrows in it. As\r\nthe tide recedes flocks of sandpipers and crows follow it down, and\r\nleave an infinity of footprints, and even quadrupeds like the domestic\r\nhog go far out at low water in search of food. It is said that in some\r\nparts of the Bay the hogs are so assiduous in this pursuit that they\r\neven awake and go out on the flats in the night tide, and that they\r\nhave so learned to dread the dangers of the flood, that when in the\r\ndarkness they hear the dull sound of the approaching bore, they squeal\r\nwith fear and rush madly for the shore.\r\n\r\nIf we examine it minutely, we shall find that the tidal deposit is\r\nlaminated. The tidal water is red and muddy, and holds in suspension\r\nsediment of various degrees of coarseness. This, undergoes a certain\r\nprocess of levigation. In the first run of the flood the coarser\r\nmaterial falls to the bottom. As its force diminishes the finer\r\nmaterial is deposited, and at full tide, when the current has ceased,\r\nthe finest of all settles, forming a delicate coat of the purest and\r\nmost tenacious clay. Thus, if a block of the material is taken up and\r\nallowed to dry, it tends to separate into thin laminæ, each of which\r\nrepresents a tide, and is somewhat sandy below, and passes into the\r\nfinest moulding clay above. The tracks and impressions preserved are\r\nnaturally made on the last or finest deposit, and filled in with the\r\ncoarser or more sandy of the next tide. But this may take place in\r\ndifferent ways. Impressions made under water at flood tide, or on\r\nthe surface left bare by the ebb, may in favourable localities be\r\nsufficiently tenacious or firm to resist the abrading action of the\r\nflood, and may thus be covered and preserved by the next layer, and in\r\nthis way they may be seen on splitting up a block of the dried mud. But\r\nin shallow places and near the shore, where the deposit has time to\r\nconsolidate and become dried by the sun and air before the next tide,\r\nmuch better impressions are preserved; and lastly, on those parts of\r\nthe shore which are reached only by the spring tides, the mud of the\r\nhighest tide of course may have several days to harden before the next\r\ntide reaches it, and in this case it becomes cracked by an infinity of\r\nshrinkage cracks, which, when it is next covered with the tide, are\r\nfilled with new sediment. In this way is produced in great perfection\r\nthat combination of footprints, or even of impressions of rain, with\r\ncasts of cracks, which is so often seen in the older rocks. Where on\r\nthe sides of channels or near the shore the mud has a considerable\r\nslope, another and very curious effect results. As the tide ebbs the\r\nwater drains off the surface, or oozing out of the wet sand and mud,\r\nforms at the top of the bank minute grooves often no larger than fine\r\nthreads. These coalesce and form small channels, and these, again,\r\nlarger ones, till at low tide the whole sloping surface is seen to be\r\ncovered with a smooth and beautiful tracery resembling the rivers on\r\na map, or the impressions of the trunks and branches of trees, or the\r\nfronds of gigantic seaweeds. These \"rill marks,\" as they have been\r\ncalled, are found in great abundance in the coal formation and triassic\r\nsandstones and shales, and I am sorry to say, have often been named and\r\ndescribed as Fucoids, and illustrated by sumptuous plates. Sometimes\r\nthese impressions are so fine as to resemble the venation of leaves,\r\nsometimes so large as to simulate trees, and I have even seen them\r\ncomplicated with shrinkage cracks, the edges of which were minutely\r\ncrenulated by little rills running into them from the surface.\r\n\r\nIt is further to be noticed that all these markings and impressions\r\non tidal shores may, when covered by succeeding deposits, appear\r\neither in intaglio or relief. On the upper surface they are of course\r\nsunken, but on the lower surface of the bed deposited on them they are\r\nin relief. It often happens also that these casts in relief are the\r\nbest preserved. This arises from the fact that the original moulds or\r\nimpressions are usually made in clay, whereas the filling material\r\nis sandy, and the latter, infiltrated with calcareous or siliceous\r\nmatter, may become a hard sandstone, while the clay may remain a\r\ncomparatively soft shale. This tendency of casts rather than of moulds\r\nto be preserved sometimes produces puzzling effects. A cylindrical\r\nor branching trail thus often assumes the appearance of a stem, and\r\nany pits or marginal impressions assume the form of projections or\r\nleaves, and thus a trail of a worm or Gastropod or a rill mark may\r\neasily simulate a plant. It is to be observed, however, that these\r\nprominent casts are on the under side of the beds, that their material\r\nis continuous with that of the beds to which they belong, and that\r\nthey are destitute of any carbonaceous matter. There are, however,\r\ncases where markings may be in relief, even on the upper surfaces of\r\nbeds. The following are illustrations of this. Just as a man walking\r\nin newly fallen snow compresses it under his feet, and if the snow be\r\nafterwards drifted away or melted away by the sun, the compressed part\r\nresists longest, and may appear as a raised footmark, so tracks made on\r\nsoft material may consolidate it so that if the soft mud be afterwards\r\nwashed away the tracks may remain projecting. Again, worms eject earthy\r\nmatter from their burrows, forming mounds, patches or raised ridges of\r\nvarious forms on the surface, and some animals burrow immediately under\r\nthe surface, pushing up the mud over them into a ridge, while others\r\npile up over their bodies pellets of clay, forming an archway or tunnel\r\nas they go. Zeiller has shown that the mole cricket forms curious\r\nroofed trails of this kind, and it seems certain that Crustaceans and\r\nmarine worms of different kinds execute similar works, and that their\r\nroofed burrows, either entire or fallen in, produce curious imitations\r\nof branches of plants.\r\n\r\nThe great and multiform army of the sea worms is indeed the most\r\nprolific source of markings on sea-formed rocks. Sometimes they cover\r\nvery large surfaces of these, or penetrate the beds as perforations,\r\nwith tortuous furrows, or holes perfectly simple, or marked with\r\nlittle striæ made by bristles or minute feet, sometimes with a\r\nfringe of little footmarks a each side, sometimes with transverse\r\nfurrows indicating the joints of the animal's body. Multitudes of\r\nthese markings have been described and named either as plants or as\r\nworm-tracks. Again, these creatures execute subterranean burrows,\r\nsometimes vertical, sometimes tortuous. These are often mere\r\ncylindrical holes afterwards filled with sand, but sometimes they have\r\nbeen lined with a membranous tube, or with the rejectamenta of the food\r\nof the animals, or with little fragments of organic matter cemented\r\ntogether. Sometimes they open on the surface as simple apertures, but\r\nagain they may be surrounded with heaps of castings, sometimes spiral\r\nin form, or with dumps of sand produced in their excavation, and which\r\nmay assume various forms, according to circumstances. Sometimes the\r\naperture is double, so that they seem to be in pairs. Sometimes, for\r\nthe convenience of the animal, the aperture is widened into the form\r\nof a funnel, and sometimes the creature, by extending its body and\r\ndrawing it in, surrounds its burrow with a series of radiating tracks\r\nsimulating the form of a starfish or sea anemone, or of the diverging\r\nbranches of a plant.\r\n\r\nCreatures of higher grade, provided with jointed limbs, naturally make\r\ntheir actions known in more complicated ways. Some years ago I had\r\nthe pleasure of spending a few weeks at the favourite sea-side resort\r\nof Orchard Beach on the New England coast, and there made my first\r\nacquaintance with that very ancient and curious creature the Limulus,\r\nor Horse-shoe Crab, or King-crab, as it is sometimes called. Orchard\r\nBeach is, I presume, near its northern range on our coast, and the\r\nspecimens seen were not very large in size, though by no means rare,\r\nand not infrequently cast on shore in storms. But the best facilities\r\nfor studying their habits were found in a marsh at no great distance\r\nfrom the hotel, where there were numerous channels, ditches and little\r\nponds filled with sea water at high tide. In these were multitudes of\r\nyoung Limuli, varying from an inch to three or four inches in breadth,\r\nand though many were dead or merely cast shells, it was easy to take\r\nyoung specimens with a landing net. A number of these were secured, and\r\nI made it my business for some time to study their habits and mode of\r\nlife, and especially the tracks which they made in sand or mud.\r\n\r\nThe King-crab, viewed from above, consists of three parts. The anterior\r\nshield or carapace is semi-circular in form, with two spines or\r\nprojecting points at the angles, raised in the middle and sloping down\r\nto a smooth or moderately sharp edge in front. The eyes are set like\r\nwindows in this shield. Two large ones at the sides, which are compound\r\neyes consisting of numerous ocelli or little eyes, and two microscopic\r\nones in front, at the base of a little spine, which are simple. The\r\nsecond or abdominal part is also in one piece, somewhat quadrate in\r\nform, with ridges and serratures at the sides armed with spines, and\r\nwhich may be said to simulate the separate joints into which the\r\nabdomen of an ordinary Crustacean is divided. The third part is a\r\nlong tail spine, triangular in cross section, sharply pointed, and so\r\njointed to the posterior end of the abdomen that it can be freely moved\r\nin any direction as a bayonet-like weapon of defence. When unable to\r\nescape from an enemy it is the habit of the creature to double itself\r\nup by bending the abdomen against the carapace, and erecting the sharp\r\nspine. Thus, with fixed bayonet it awaits attack, like the kneeling\r\nsoldier in front of a square.\r\n\r\nBelow this upper shield, which is thin and papery in the young,\r\nsomewhat horny in the adult, are the numerous limbs of the creature,\r\nwith which we are at present most concerned. Under the carapace\r\nare several pairs of jointed limbs differing in size and form. The\r\ntwo anterior are small and peculiarly formed claws, used apparently\r\nin manipulating the food. The four next are larger in size, and are\r\nwalking feet, each furnished with two sharp points which form a pincer\r\nfor holding. The last pair is much larger and stronger than any of the\r\nothers, and armed not only with a pair of pincers, but with four blunt\r\nnail-like points. Under the abdomen are flat swimming feet, as they\r\nhave been called, each composed of a broad plate notched and divided in\r\nthe middle. When at rest these lie flat on each other, but they can be\r\nflapped back and forth at the will of the animal.\r\n\r\nLet us now see what use the creature can make of these numerous and\r\nvaried pedal appendages, and for distinctness' sake we shall call the\r\nanterior set thoracic and the posterior abdominal. When placed in\r\nshallow water on fine sand it walked slowly forward, and its tracks\r\nthen consisted of a number of punctures on the sand in two lines. If,\r\nhowever, the water was very shallow or the sand very soft or inclined\r\nupward the two edges of the carapace touched the bottom, making a\r\nslight furrow at each side; and if the tail was trailed on the bottom,\r\nthis made a third or central furrow. When climbing a slope, or when\r\nplaced at the edge of the water, it adopted another mode of locomotion,\r\npushing with great force with its two posterior limbs, and thus moving\r\nforward by jerks. It then made four deep marks with the toes of each\r\nhind limb, and more or less interrupted marks with the edges of the\r\ncarapace and the tail. In these circumstances the marks were almost\r\nexactly like those of some forms of the Protichnites of the Potsdam\r\nsandstone. When in sufficiently deep-water and desirous to escape,\r\nit flapped its abdominal feet, and then swam or glided close to the\r\nbottom. In this case, when moving near the soft bottom, it produced\r\na series of transverse ridges and furrows like small ripple marks,\r\nwith a slight ridge in the middle, and sometimes, when the edges of\r\nthe carapace touched the bottom, with lateral furrows. In this way\r\nthe animals were able to swim with some ease and rapidity, and on\r\none occasion I observed an individual, confined in a tub of water,\r\nraise itself from the bottom and swim around the tub at the surface\r\nin search of a way of escape. Lastly, the young Limuli were fond of\r\nhiding themselves by burrowing in the sand. They did this by pushing\r\nthe anterior rounded end of the carapace under the sand, and then\r\nvigorously shovelling out the material from below with their feet, so\r\nthat they gradually sank under the surface, and the sand flowed in upon\r\nthem till they were entirely covered. If carefully removed from the\r\nhollow they had made, this was found to be ovoid or hoof shaped in form\r\nand bilobed, not unlike the curious hollows (_Rusophycus Grenvillensis_\r\nof Billings) which I have supposed to be burrows of Trilobites.\r\n\r\nI thus found that the common King-crab could produce a considerable\r\nvariety of tracks and burrows comparable with those which have been\r\nnamed Protichnites, Climactichnites, Bilobites, Cruziana, Rusichnites,\r\netc.; and that the kind of markings depended partly on the differences\r\nof gait in the animal, and partly on the circumstances in which it was\r\nplaced; so that different kinds of tracks do not always prove diversity\r\nin the animals producing them.\r\n\r\nThe interest of this investigation as applied to Limulus is increased\r\nby the fact that this creature is the near ally of Trilobites,\r\nEurypterids and other Crustaceans which were abundant in the earlier\r\ngeological ages, and whose footprints are probably among the most\r\ncommon we find on the rocks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rusichnites Grenvillensis, Billings a \"Bilobite.\"\r\nProbably the Cast of a Crustacean burrow.]\r\n\r\nLastly, on this part of the subject, it is to be observed that many\r\nother marine animals, both crustaceans and worms, make impressions\r\nresembling in general character those of Limulus. In addition to those\r\nalready mentioned, Nathorst and Bureau have shown that various kinds\r\nof shrimps and lobster-like Crustaceans, when swimming rapidly by\r\nsuccessive strokes of the tail, make double furrows with transverse\r\nridges resembling those of Bilobites, and there are even some mollusks\r\nwhich by the undulations of the foot or the hook-like action of its\r\nanterior part, can make similar trails. A question arises here as to\r\nthe value of such things as fossils. This depends on the fact that\r\nmany creatures have left their marks on the rocks when still soft on\r\nthe sea bottom, of which we have no other indications, and it also\r\ndepends on our ability to understand the import of these unconscious\r\nhieroglyphics. They will certainly be of little use to us so long as\r\nwe persist in regarding them as vegetable forms, and until we have\r\nvery carefully studied all kinds of modern markings.[150] Nor does it\r\nseem of much use to assign to them specific names. The same trail\r\noften changes from one so-called species, or even genus, to another in\r\ntracing it along, and the same animal may in different circumstances\r\nmake very different kinds of tracks. There will eventually, perhaps,\r\narise some general kind of nomenclature for these markings under a\r\nseparate sub-science of Ichnology or the doctrine of Footprints.\r\n\r\n[150] Geologists are greatly indebted to Dr. Nathorst of Stockholm for\r\nhis painstaking researches of this kind.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of true Algæ or seaweeds, of which there are many\r\nfossil species known to us by their forms, and also by the carbonaceous\r\nor pyritous matter, or discharge of colour from the matrix, which\r\nfurnishes evidence of the presence of organic material; nor of the\r\nmarks and trails left by seaweeds and land plants drifting in currents,\r\nsome of which are very curious and fantastic; nor of those singular\r\ntrails referred to the arms of cuttle-fishes and the fins of fishes,\r\nor to sea jellies and starfishes. These might form materials for a\r\ntreatise. My object here is merely to indicate the mode of dealing with\r\nsuch things, and the kind of information to be derived from them.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the consideration of actual footprints of vertebrate\r\nanimals having limbs, the information we can obtain is of a far more\r\ndefinite character. This has already been referred to in treating of\r\nthe first Air-breathers in a previous chapter. One very curious example\r\nwe may close with. It is that of the celebrated \"bird tracks\" of the\r\nsandstone quarries in the Trias of Connecticut and Massachusetts.\r\nThese tracks, of immense size, as much as eighteen inches in length,\r\nand so arranged as to indicate the stride of a long-legged biped, were\r\nnaturally referred to gigantic birds, allied to modern waders. But\r\nwhen it was found that some of them showed a central furrow indicating\r\na long tail trailing behind, this conclusion was shaken, and when in\r\ntracing them along, places were found where the animal had sat down\r\non its haunches and the end of its tail, and had brought down to the\r\nground a pair of small fore feet with four or five fingers, it was\r\ndiscovered that we had to deal with biped reptiles; and when the\r\ntracks were correlated with the bones of the extinct reptiles known\r\nas Dinosaurs, we found ourselves in the presence of a group of the\r\nmost strange and portentous reptilian forms that the earth has ever\r\nknown. Marsh has been enabled, by nearly perfect skeletons of some\r\nallied reptilian bipeds found in the West, to reproduce them in their\r\nexact forms and proportions, so that we can realize in imagination\r\ntheir aspect, their gait, and their gigantic proportions. Examples of\r\nthis putting together of footprints and osseous remains of vertebrate\r\nanimals are not rare in the history of geology, and show us how the\r\nmonsters of the ancient world, equally with their human successors,\r\ncould leave \"footprints on the sands of time.\"\r\n\r\nThe Dinosaurs which have left their footprints on the sandstones of\r\nConnecticut and Massachusetts are, however, greatly more numerous\r\nthan those known to us by osseous remains. Thus footprints have the\r\nfurther use of filling up the imperfections of our geological record,\r\nor at least of pointing out gaps which but for them we might not have\r\nsuspected. The remarkable inferences of Matthew already referred to,\r\nrespecting cuttle-fishes in the Cambrian period, constitute a case in\r\npoint. Footprints of Batrachians in the Carboniferous rocks were known\r\nbefore their bones. The strange hand-like tracks in the Trias were\r\nknown before we knew the Labyrinthodon that produced them. We are still\r\nignorant of the animals whose tracks in the old Potsdam sandstones we\r\nname Protichnites.\r\n\r\n  References:--On Rusichnites (a form of Bilobite), _Canadian\r\n    Naturalist_, 1864.

When our minds have been\r\nfamiliarized with the continuous processes by which vaporous nebulæ\r\nmay be differentiated into distinct planets, and these may be slowly\r\ncooled from an incandescent state till their surfaces become resolved\r\ninto areas of land and water; and still more, when we contemplate the\r\ngrand procession of forms of life from the earliest animals and plants\r\nto man and his contemporaries, we become converts to the doctrine that\r\nall things are in a perpetual flux, and that every succeeding day sees\r\nthem different from what they were the day before. In this state of\r\nmind the scientific student is apt to overlook the fact that there are\r\nmany things which remain the same through all the ages, or which, once\r\nsettled, admit of no change. I do not here refer to those fundamental\r\nproperties of matter and forces and laws of nature which form the basis\r\nof uniformitarianism in geology, but to determinations and arrangements\r\nwhich might easily have been quite different from what they are, but\r\nwhich, once settled, seem to remain for ever.\r\n\r\nWe have already considered the great fact that the nuclei and ribs of\r\nthe continental masses were laid down as foundations in the earliest\r\nperiods, and have been built upon by determinate additions, more\r\nespecially upon their edges and their hollows, so that while there\r\nhas been a constant process of removal of material from the higher\r\nparts of the land, and deposition in the sea, and while there have\r\nbeen periodical elevations and subsidences, the great areas of land\r\nand water have remained substantially the same, and the main lines\r\nof elevation and folding have conformed to the directions originally\r\nfixed. Thus, in regard to the dry land itself, there has been fixity,\r\non the one hand, and mutation on the other, of a most paradoxical\r\naspect, till we understand something of the great law of constant\r\nchange united with perennial fixity in nature. From want of attention\r\nto this, the permanence of continents is still a debated question,\r\nand it is difficult for many to understand how the frequent dips\r\nof the continental plateaus and margins under the sea, and their\r\nre-elevation, often along with portions of the shallower sea bottom,\r\ncan be consistent with a general permanence of the position of the\r\ncontinents and of the corresponding ocean abysses; yet, when this is\r\nproperly understood, it becomes plain that the union of fixity with\r\nchanges of level has been a main cause of the continuity and changes\r\nof organic beings. Only the submergence of inland plateaus under\r\nshallow and warm waters could have given scope for the introduction\r\nof new marine faunas, and only re-elevation could have permitted\r\nthe greatest extension of plants and animals of the land. Thus, the\r\ncontinuity of life with continual advance has depended on the permanent\r\nexistence of continental and oceanic areas; and the continents that\r\nremain to us with all their diversity of elevation and outline, their\r\nvaried productions, both mineral and organic, and their life, which\r\nis a select remainder of all that went before, have been produced and\r\nfurnished by a succession of changes, modified by the most conservative\r\nretention of general arrangements and forms.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that it is not merely permanence we have\r\nto deal with here, but permanence of position along with change of\r\nelevation; and this modified by the fact that there have always been\r\nmountain ridges, internal plateaus, and marginal areas affected in\r\nvarious ways by the vertical movement of the land. Further, the\r\nelevation and subsidence of the land have not always been uniform,\r\nbut often differential, while every movement has tended to produce\r\nmodifications of ocean currents and of atmospheric conditions. The\r\nwhole subject, more especially in its relations to life, thus becomes\r\nvery complicated, and it is perhaps in consequence of partial and\r\nimperfect views on these points that so much diversity of opinion has\r\narisen. For example, it is evident that we can gain nothing by adding\r\nto the continents those submerged margins delineated by Murray in\r\nthe _Challenger_ reports, and which have in periods of continental\r\nelevation themselves formed portions of the land. Nor do we establish a\r\ncase in favour of perished oceanic continents by the argument that they\r\nare needed to furnish the materials of marginal mountains which are due\r\nto the continuous sweeping of arctic material to the south by currents,\r\nas we see in the coast of North America to-day. Nor do we invalidate\r\nthe permanence of the continents by the bridges of land, islands,\r\nand shallow water at various times thrown across the Atlantic. The\r\ndistribution of Cambrian Trilobites, as illustrated by Matthew,[151]\r\nseems to show a bridge of this kind in the north in very early times,\r\nand similar evidence is furnished by the animals and plants of the\r\nDevonian and Carboniferous, and by the sea animals and plants of the\r\nlater Tertiary and modern. Gardener has postulated a southern bridge\r\nin the region of the West Indies for the migrations of plants, and\r\nGregory has adduced the evidence of those conservative and slow-moving\r\ncreatures, the sea urchins, in favour of similar connection in the West\r\nIndian region at two distinct periods of time (the Lower Cretaceous and\r\nthe Miocene Tertiary). But bridges do not involve want of permanence\r\nin their termini. Because an engineer has bridged the Firth of Forth,\r\nit does not follow that the banks of this inlet did not exist before\r\nthe bridge was built; and if the bridge were to perish, the evidence\r\nthat trains had once passed that way would not justify the belief that\r\nthe bed of the Firth had been dry land, and the areas north and south\r\nof it depressed. The more we consider this question the more we see\r\nthat the permanence, growth and sculpture of the continents are parts\r\nof a great continuous and far-reaching plan. This view is strengthened\r\nrather than otherwise, when we consider the probable manner in which\r\nthe enormous weight of the continents is sustained above the waters. We\r\nmay attribute this, on the one hand, to rigidity and lateral arching\r\nand compression, or, on the other, to what may be termed flotation of\r\nthe lighter parts of the crust; and there seems to be little doubt\r\nthat both of these principles have been employed in constructing the\r\n\"pillars which support the earth.\" It is evident, however, that an arch\r\nthrown over the internal abyss of the earth, or a portion of its crust\r\nso lightened as to be pressed upward by its heavier surroundings, must,\r\nwhen once established, have become a permanent feature of the earth's\r\nfoundations, not to be disturbed without calamitous consequences to its\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\n[151] Transactions Royal Society of Canada, 1892.\r\n\r\nIt is the part of the philosophical naturalist to bring together these\r\napparent contrarieties of mutation and permanence; both of which are\r\nincluded, each in its proper place, in the great plan of nature. It is\r\ntherefore my purpose in the present chapter to direct attention to some\r\nof the terminal points or fixed arrangements that we meet with in the\r\ncourse of the geological history, and even in its earlier parts, and\r\nmore particularly in reference to the organic world. This, which is in\r\nitself constantly changing, has been placed under necessity to adhere\r\nto certain determinations fixed of old, and which regulate its forms\r\nand possibilities down to our own time.\r\n\r\nThe argument, as we have seen in a previous chapter, for the animal\r\nnature of Eozoon depends on our assuming certain parts of this fixity.\r\nWe suppose that then as now calcium carbonate had been selected as the\r\nmaterial for the skeletons of such creatures; that then, as now, minute\r\ntubuli and large canals were necessary to enable the soft animal matter\r\nto permeate and pass through the skeleton, and that the protoplasmic\r\nanimal matter of these far back geological periods had the same vital\r\nproperties of contraction and extension, digestion, etc., that it has\r\nto-day. Could any one prove that these determinations of vital and\r\nother forces had not been established, or that living protoplasmic\r\nmatter, with all its wonderful properties, had not been constructed in\r\nthe Laurentian period, the existence of this ancient animal would be\r\nimpossible. Yet how much is implied in all this, and though nothing\r\nis more unstable chemically or vitally than protoplasm, if it were\r\nintroduced in the Laurentian, it has continued practically unchanged up\r\nto the present time.\r\n\r\nIf we pass on to the undoubted and varied life of the Cambrian period,\r\nwe shall find that multitudes of things which might have been otherwise\r\nwere already settled in a way that has required no change.\r\n\r\nIn the oldest Trilobites the whole of the mechanical conditions of an\r\nexternal articulated skeleton had been finally settled. The material\r\nchitinous or partly calcareous, its microscopic structure, fitted to\r\ncombine lightness and strength with facility for rapid growth, the\r\nsubdivision of its several rings, so as to form a protective armour\r\nand a mobile skeleton, the arrangement of its spines for defence\r\nwithout interfering with locomotion, the contrivance of hinge joints\r\narranged in different planes in the limbs, all these were already in\r\nfull perfection, and just as they are found to-day in the skeleton of a\r\nking-crab or any other Crustacean. They have, it is true, been modified\r\ninto a vast number of subordinate forms and uses, but the general\r\nprinciples and main structures all stand. I was much struck with this\r\nrecently in studying a remarkable specimen now in the National Museum\r\nat Washington. It is a large species of Asaphus; the same genus which\r\ngave to the late Mr. Billings the limbs of a Trilobite, the first ever\r\ndescribed; but in the Washington specimen they are remarkably perfect.\r\nEach limb presents a series of joints resembling those of the tarsus of\r\nan insect, each joint being of conical form with the narrow proximal\r\nend articulated to the enlarged distal end of the previous one, so\r\nas to give great facility of movement and accommodation for delicate\r\nmuscular bands. This tells us of muscular fibre and tendon fitted for\r\nflexing and extending these numerous joints, of motor nerves to work\r\nthat marvellous contractile power of the striated muscle, whose mode\r\nof action is still an insoluble mystery, yet one practically solved in\r\nthe remote Cambrian age for the benefit of these humble inhabitants\r\nof the sea. If we could imagine that the inventive power to perfect\r\nsuch machinery was present in the brains of these old Crustaceans or\r\nArachnidans, we might wish that some of them had survived to instruct\r\nus in matters which baffle our research.\r\n\r\nIt is long since the compound eyes of these Trilobites, as illustrated\r\nby Burmeister, gave Buckland the opportunity to infer that the laws\r\nof light and of vision were the same from the first as now. But what\r\ndoes this imply? Not only that the light of the sun penetrating to the\r\ndepths of the Cambrian sea, was regulated by the same laws as to-day,\r\nbut that a series of cameras was perfected to receive the light as\r\nreflected from objects, to picture the appearance of these objects on\r\na retinal screen as sensitive as the film of the photographer, and\r\nthereby to produce true perceptions of vision in the sensorium of these\r\nancient animals. I have before me a fragment of the eye of a Trilobite\r\n(_Phacops_), in which may be seen the little radiating tubes provided\r\nfor the several ocelli of the compound eye, just as we see in the\r\nmodern Limulus; and each of these ocelli must have been a perfect\r\nphotographic camera, and more than this, since absolutely automatic,\r\nand probably having the power to represent colour as well as light\r\nand shade. We know also, from the recent experiments of an Austrian\r\nphysiologist on the eyes of insects, that such compound eyes are so\r\nconstructed as to present a single picture, just as we can see the\r\nwhole landscape in looking through the many little panes of a cottage\r\nwindow. In our own time the king-crab and lobster no doubt see just\r\nas their predecessors did millions of years ago, and with precisely\r\nsimilar instruments.\r\n\r\nBut the eyes of the modern Crustaceans have to compete with eyes of a\r\ndissimilar type, constructed on the same general optical principles,\r\nbut quite different in detail. These are the simple or single eyes\r\nof the cuttle-fishes and the true fishes. The same rivalry existed\r\nin the oldest seas, when the competition of Crustaceans and cuttles\r\nwas just as keen as now. Though the eyes of the latter have not been\r\npreserved, or at least have not yet been found, we have a right to\r\ninfer that the cuttles of the Cambrian and Silurian seas must have\r\nbeen able to see as well as their Crustacean foes and competitors. If\r\nso, the other type of eye must have been perfected for aquatic vision\r\nas early as the compound type. In any case we know that a little\r\nlater, in the Carboniferous period, we have evidence that the eyes of\r\nfishes conformed to those of their modern successors. I have myself\r\ndescribed[152] a carboniferous fish (_Palæoniscus_) from the bituminous\r\nshales of Albert County, New Brunswick, in which the hard globular lens\r\nof the eye had been sufficiently firm and durable to retain its form,\r\nand to be replaced by calcite, showing even that like the lens of the\r\neye of a modern fish it had been constructed of concentric laminæ. In\r\nthe Carboniferous period also, both types of eye, the compound and\r\nthe single, experienced the further modifications necessary to fit\r\nthem for vision in air, the compound eye in insects, the simple eye in\r\nBatrachians.[153] The original photographic cameras, strange though\r\nthis may appear to us, were intended for use under water; but at a very\r\nearly time they were adapted to work in air.\r\n\r\n[152] _Canadian Naturalist._\r\n\r\n[153] See _ante_, chapter on Air-breathers.\r\n\r\nBut we must bear in mind that this early solving of advanced problems\r\nin mechanics, optics and physiology was in favour of Crustaceans\r\nand cuttles, which were lords of creation in their time. There were\r\nin those early days humbler creatures whose structures also present\r\nwonderful contrivances.\r\n\r\nI have already referred, in the chapter on imperfection of the\r\ngeological record, to the fossil sponges which have been found in so\r\ngreat number and perfection in some of the oldest rocks of Canada, and\r\nwhich have for the first time enabled us to appreciate the forms and\r\nstructures of the wonderful silicious sponges which preceded those\r\nwith which the dredgings of the _Challenger_ have made us familiar in\r\nthe modern seas. Humble sarcodous animals, without distinct muscular\r\nor nervous system or external senses, the sponges have at least to\r\nlive and grow, and to that end they must already, in the dawn of life\r\non our planet,[154] have perfected those arrangements of ciliated\r\ncells in chambers and canals which the microscope shows us driving\r\ncurrents of water through the modern sponges, and thereby bringing to\r\nthem the materials of food and means of respiration. It is true we\r\nknow as little as the sponges themselves of the _modus operandi_ of\r\nthose perpetually waving threads which we call cilia or flagella, yet\r\nthey must have existed with all their powers even before the Cambrian\r\nperiod.[155]\r\n\r\n[154] I have found spicules of sponges in the chert nodules from the\r\nHuronian limestones of Canada.\r\n\r\n[155] Many species of hexaclinelled sponges have been described from\r\nthe upper Cambrian or lower Cambro-Silurian of Canada. See paper by the\r\nauthor in the Transactions of the Royal Society of Canada, 1889.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Giant Net-sponge.--_Palæosaccus Dawsoni_, Hinde. From\r\nthe Quebec group (Ordovician), Little Metis, Canada. Reduced to 3/7 the\r\ndiameter. (From the _Geological Magazine_, 1803.)]\r\n\r\nThe sponge, in order to support its delicate protoplasmic structures,\r\nmust have a skeleton. In modern times we find these creatures\r\ndepositing corneous or horny fibres, as in the common washing sponges,\r\nor forming complex and beautiful structures of needles, or threads of\r\nsilica or calcite, and they seem from the first to have been able to\r\navail themselves of all these different materials. The oldest species\r\nthat we know had silicious or calcareous skeletons, though some of them\r\nmust also have had a certain amount, at least, of the ordinary spongy\r\nor corneous fibres. But the most astonishing feature in what remains\r\nof their skeletons, flattened out as they are on the surfaces of dark\r\nslaty rock, is the manner in which they worked up so refractory a\r\nmaterial as silica into fibres like spun glass rods and crosses, and\r\nbuilt these up into beautiful basket-like forms, globular, cylindrical\r\nor conical. It was necessary that they should fix themselves on the\r\nsoft muddy bottoms on which they grew, and to this end they produced\r\nslender silicious fibres or anchoring rods, which, fine though they\r\nwere, had the form of hollow tubes. Sometimes a single rod sufficed,\r\nbut in this case it had a cross-like anchor affixed to its lower end, to\r\ngive it stability. Sometimes there were several simple rods, and then\r\nthey were skilfully braced by spreading them apart at the ends, and by\r\nflattening their extremities into blades. Sometimes four rods joined in\r\na loop at the end gave the required support. Some larger species wound\r\ntogether many threads like a wire rope, and even added to this flanges\r\nlike the thread of a screw, anticipating the principle of the modern\r\nscrew pile.\r\n\r\nThe body of the sponge must be hollow within, and must have a large\r\naperture or opening for the discharge of water, and smaller pores for\r\nits admission. Various general forms were adopted for this. Some were\r\nglobular, or oval, or pear-shaped; others cylindrical, concave, or\r\nmitre-shaped. To give form and strength to these shapes there were\r\nsometimes vertical and transverse rods soldered together. In other\r\ncases there were four-rayed or six-rayed needles of silica, with their\r\npoints attached so as to form a beautiful lattice-work, with its\r\nmeshes either square or lozenge-shaped. For protection sharp needles\r\nwere arranged like _chevaux de frize_ at the sides and apertures, and\r\nthese last were sometimes covered with a hood or grating of needles,\r\nto exclude intruders from the interior cavity. Other species, however,\r\nlike some in the modern seas, seemed to despise these niceties, and\r\ncontented themselves with long straight needles placed in bundles, or\r\nradiating from a centre, and thus supporting and protecting their soft\r\nand sensitive protoplasm.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, these old sponges did not avail themselves of the\r\nnatural cystallization of silica, which, left to itself, would have\r\nformed six-rayed stars, with the rays at angles of sixty degrees, or\r\nsix-sided plates, rods, or pyramids. They adopted another and peculiar\r\nform of the mineral, known as colloidal silica, and being thus relieved\r\nfrom any need to be guided by its crystalline form, treated it as we do\r\nglass, and shaped it into cylindrical tubes, round needles and stars or\r\ncrosses, with the rays at right angles to each other.\r\n\r\nThe sponges whose skeletons are thus constructed, and which anticipated\r\nso many mechanical contrivances long afterwards devised by man,\r\nbelonged to a group of silicious sponges (_Hexaclinellidæ_) which is\r\nstill extant, and represented by many rare and beautiful species of\r\nthe deep sea, which are the ornaments of our museums, and of which the\r\nbeautiful Eupleectella or Venus flower-basket, from the Philippine\r\nIslands, and the glass-rope sponge (_Hyalonema_), from Japan, are\r\nexamples. But contemporary with these there was another group\r\n(_Lithistidæ_), constructing skeletons of carbonate of lime, and which\r\npreferred, instead of the regular mechanical structures of the others,\r\na kind of rustic work, made up of irregular fibres, very beautiful and\r\nstrong, but as a matter of pattern and taste standing quite by itself.\r\nIf there were any sponges with altogether soft and spongy skeletons in\r\nthese old times, their remains do not seem to have been preserved.\r\n\r\nHere, it will be observed, are a great variety of vital and mechanical\r\ncontrivances devised in the very early history of the earth, settled\r\nfor all time, and handed down without improvement, and with little\r\nchange, to our later day. They are indeed vastly more wonderful than\r\nthe above general account can show; for to go into the details of\r\nstructure of any one of the species would develop a multitude of minor\r\ncomplexities and niceties which no one not specially a student of these\r\nanimals could appreciate.\r\n\r\nThese are not solitary cases. The student of fossils meets with them\r\nat every turn; and if he possesses the taste and imagination of a true\r\nnaturalist, cannot fail to be impressed with them.\r\n\r\nTo turn to a later but very ancient period, what can be more\r\nastonishing than those first air-breathing vertebrates of the Coal\r\nformation referred to in a previous chapter, with all their special\r\narrangements for an aërial habitat? I have mentioned their footprints,\r\nand when we see the quarrymen split open a slab of sandstone and expose\r\na series of great plantigrade tracks, not unlike those of a human foot,\r\nwith the five toes well-developed, we are almost as much astonished as\r\nCrusoe was when he saw the footprints on the sand. Crusoe inferred the\r\npresence of another man in his island; we infer the earliest appearance\r\nof an air-breathing vertebrate and the pre-human determination of the\r\nform and number of parts of the human foot and hand, to appear in the\r\nworld long ages afterward. We see also that already that decimal system\r\nof notation which we have founded on the counting of our ten fingers\r\nwas settled in the framework of most unmathematical Batrachians. It has\r\napproved itself ever since as the typical and most perfect number of\r\nparts for such organs.\r\n\r\nIf sceptically inclined, we may ask, Why five rather than four or six?\r\nIn the case of man we see that individuals who have lost one finger\r\nhave the use of the hand impaired, while the few who happen to have\r\nsix do not seem to be the better. How it was with the old Batrachians\r\nwe do not know; but it is certain that if we could have amputated the\r\nclaw-bearing little toe of _Sauropus unguifer_, or the reflexed little\r\ntoe of _Cheirotherium_, we should have much injured their locomotive\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe vegetable kingdom is full of similar examples of the early\r\nsettlement of great questions. Perhaps nothing is more marvellous\r\nthan the power of the green cells of the leaf as workers of those\r\ncomplex and inimitable chemical changes whereby out of the water,\r\ncarbon dioxide and ammonia of the soil and the atmosphere, the living\r\nvegetable cell, with the aid of solar energy, elaborates all the varied\r\norganic compounds produced by the vegetable kingdom. Yet this seems all\r\nto have been settled and perfected in the old Silurian period, long\r\nbefore any kind of plant now living was on the earth. Perhaps in some\r\nform it existed even in the Laurentian age, and was instrumental in\r\nlaying up its great beds of carbon. So all that is essential in plant\r\nreproduction, whether in that simpler form in which a one-celled spore\r\nis the reproductive organ, or in that more complex form in which an\r\nembryo plant is formed in the seed, with a store of nourishment laid up\r\nfor its sustenance.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements were obviously as perfect in the great club mosses\r\nand pines of the Devonian and Carboniferous as they have ever been\r\nsince, and we have specimens so preserved as to show their minute parts\r\njust as well as in recent plants. The microscope also shows us that\r\nthe contrivances for thickening and strengthening the woody fibres and\r\ntrunk of the stem by bars or interrupted linings of ligneous matter, so\r\nas to give strength and at the same time permit transudation of sap,\r\nwere all perfected, down to their minutest details, in the oldest land\r\nplants. It is true that flowers with gay petals and some of the more\r\ncomplicated kinds of fruit are later inventions, but the additions\r\nin these consist mainly of accessories. The essentials of vegetable\r\nreproduction were as well provided for from the first.\r\n\r\nThe same principle applies to many of the leading forms and types of\r\nlife, considered as genera or species. While some of these are of\r\nrecent introduction, others have continued almost unchanged from the\r\nremotest ages. Such creatures as the Lingulæ, some of the Crustaceans\r\nand of the Mollusks, the Polyzoa and some Corals have remained with\r\nscarcely any change throughout geological time, while others have\r\ndisappeared, and have been replaced by new types.\r\n\r\nWe began this chapter with a consideration of the permanence of\r\ncontinental areas, and may close with a reference to the same great\r\nfact in connection with the continuity of life. Whether with some we\r\nattach more importance to the support of the continents by lateral\r\npressure and rigidity, or with others to what may be termed flotation,\r\nby virtue of their less density, as compared with that of the lower\r\nparts of the earth; there can be little doubt that both principles have\r\nbeen applied, and that both admit of some vertical movement. Thus the\r\nstability of the continents is one of position rather than height, and\r\ntheir internal plateaus as well as their partially submerged marginal\r\nslopes have undergone great and unequal elevations and depressions,\r\ncausing most important geographical changes. Among these are the\r\nformation of connecting bridges of shoals, islands, or low land,\r\nconnecting the continental masses at different periods, and permitting\r\nmigrations of shallow-water animals and even of denizens of the land.\r\nThe facts adduced in previous pages are sufficient to show connections\r\nacross the north of the Atlantic at intervals reaching from the\r\nCambrian to the Modern.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the whole matter is that there is a fixity and\r\nunchangeableness in determinations and arrangements of force just\r\nas much as in natural laws; and that while God has made everything\r\nbeautiful in its time He has also made everything beautiful and useful\r\nin some sense for all time. With all this, while the great principles\r\nand modes of operation remain unchanged, there is ample scope for\r\ndevelopment, modification and adaptation to new ends, without deviation\r\nfrom essential properties and characters. It is a wise and thoughtful\r\nphilosophy which can distinguish what is fixed and unchangeable from\r\nthat which is fluctuating and capable of development. Until this\r\ndistinction is fully understood, we may expect one-sided views and\r\nfaulty generalizations in our attempts to understand nature.\r\n\r\n  References:--\"The Chain of Life in Geological Times.\" London.

One of these which has been dominant for a long time in geology,\r\nand has scarcely yet run its course, is that of the Great Ice Age,\r\nwith its accompaniments of Continental Glaciers and Polar Ice Cap.\r\nThe cause of this it is not difficult to discern. The covering of\r\ntill, gravel and travelled boulders which encumbers the surface of the\r\nnorthern hemisphere from the Arctic regions more than half way to the\r\nequator, had long been a puzzle to geologists, and this was increased\r\nrather than diminished when the doctrine of appeal to recent causes on\r\nthe principle of uniformity became current. It was seen that it was\r\nnecessary to invoke the action of ice in some form to account for these\r\ndeposits, and it was at the same time perceived that there was much\r\nevidence to prove that between the warm climate of the early Tertiary\r\nand the more subdued mildness of the modern time there had intervened a\r\nperiod of unusual and extreme cold. In this state of affairs attention\r\nwas attracted to the Alpine glaciers. Their movement, their erosion\r\nof surfaces, their heaping up of moraines bearing some resemblance to\r\nthe widely extended boulder deposits, their former greater extension,\r\nas indicated by old moraines at lower levels than those in process of\r\nformation, were noted. Here was a modern cause capable of explaining\r\nall the phenomena. Men's minds were taken by storm, and as always\r\nhappens in the case of new and important discoveries, the agency of\r\nglaciers was pushed at once far beyond the possibilities of their\r\naction under any known physical or climatal laws. This exaggerated idea\r\nof the action of land ice in the form of glaciers is not yet exploded,\r\nmore especially in the United States, where official sanction has been\r\ngiven to it by the Geological Survey, and where it has been introduced\r\neven into school and college text-books. It affords also a telling\r\nbit of scientific sensationalism, which can scarcely be resisted by a\r\ncertain class of popular writers. America has also afforded greater\r\nfacilities for extreme theories of this kind, owing to the wide and\r\nuninterrupted distribution of glacial deposits, and the more simple\r\nand less broken character of its great internal plateau, while the\r\ninfluence of great leading minds, like those of the elder Agassiz and\r\nof Dana, naturally held sway over the younger geologists. Fortunately\r\nCanada, which possesses the larger and more northern half of the\r\nNorth American continent; though numerically inferior, and therefore\r\noverborne in the discussion, has, in the main, remained steadfast to\r\nfacts rather than to specious theories, and has been confirmed in this\r\nposition by the clearer testimony of nature in a region where many of\r\nthe features of the glacial age still persist.[156]\r\n\r\n[156] I may refer here to the recent researches of Dr. G. M. Dawson,\r\nMr. R. Chalmers, Mr. McConnell and Dr. Ells.\r\n\r\nThe writer of these pages has, ever since the publication of the first\r\nedition of his \"Acadian Geology,\"[157] steadily resisted the more\r\nextreme views of glaciation, and has opposed the southward progress of\r\nthe great continental glacier. Though, figuratively speaking, overborne\r\nand pressed back in the course of its extension, he has now, like\r\nthose primitive men who are imagined in the post-glacial age to have\r\nfollowed up the retreat of the ice, the pleasure of seeing the once\r\nformidable continental glacier broken up into great local glaciers on\r\nthe mountain ranges separated by intervening areas of submergence.\r\n\r\n[157] 1855.\r\n\r\nThe questions relating to this subject are too numerous and varied\r\nfor treatment here. The question of the causes of the great lowering\r\nof temperature in the glacial age I shall leave for consideration in\r\nthe next chapter, and merely state here that I believe changes of\r\ndistribution of sea and land and of ocean currents are sufficient to\r\naccount for all the refrigeration of which there is good evidence. I\r\ncontent myself with a comparison of the glacial phenomena of Mont Blanc\r\nand of the Gulf of St. Lawrence from my own observation,[158] and some\r\ngeneral deductions as to glacier possibilities.\r\n\r\n[158] Published in 1867.\r\n\r\nA scientific voyager carries with him a species of questioning peculiar\r\nto himself. Not content with vacantly gazing at the sea, scrutinizing\r\nhis fellow passengers, noting the changes of the weather and the length\r\nof the day's run, he recognises in the sea one of the great features\r\nof the earth, and questions it daily as to its present and its past\r\nThe present features of the sea include much of surpassing interest,\r\nbut the questions which relate to its origin and early history are\r\nstill more attractive. Some of these questions are likely to interest\r\na voyager from Canada entering the Atlantic by one of its greatest\r\ntributaries, the St. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nIn doing so, we approach the ocean not at a right angle, but along a\r\nline only slightly inclined to its western side, and we find ourselves\r\nin a broad estuary or trough, having on its north-western side rugged\r\nhills of old crystalline rocks, the Laurentian, ridged up in great\r\nfolds or earth waves parallel to the river. On the south-east or\r\nright-hand side we have a lower barrier of earth waves composed of\r\nsedimentary rocks somewhat later in date, but still geologically very\r\nancient. We are thus introduced to a remarkable feature of the west\r\nside of the North Atlantic, namely, that its border is made up of\r\nvery old rocks folded into mountain ridges thrown up at an ancient\r\nperiod, and approximately parallel to the coast. The Lower St. Lawrence\r\noccupies a furrow between two of these ridges.\r\n\r\nHere, however, a more modern feature attracts our attention. The sides\r\nof the bounding hills are cut in a succession of terraces, rising one\r\nabove another from the level of the sea to a height of 500 feet or\r\nmore, capped with long ranges of the white houses and barns of the\r\nCanadian habitants, and furnishing level lines for the \"concession\r\nroads\" which run along the coast. These terraces are really old sea\r\nmargins indicating the stages of the elevation of the land out of the\r\nsea immediately before the modern period. On these terraces, and in the\r\nclays and sands which form the plateaus extending in some places in\r\nfront of them, are sea shells of the same kinds with those now living\r\nin the Gulf of St. Lawrence, and occasionally we find bones of whales\r\nwhich have been stranded on the old beaches.\r\n\r\nThese terraces are, of course, indications of change of level in very\r\nmodern times. They show that in what we call the Pleistocene age the\r\nland was lower than at present, and we shall find that in the Lower\r\nSt. Lawrence there is evidence of a depression extending to over 1,000\r\nfeet, carrying the sea far up the valley, so that sea shells are found\r\nin the clays as far up as Kingston and Ottawa, and stranded skeletons\r\nof whales as far west as Smith's Falls, in Ontario.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the shores more minutely, we shall find all along the\r\nsouth coast a belt of boulders which are often as much as eight to ten\r\nfeet in diameter, and consist largely of rocks found only in the hills\r\nof the northern coast, more than thirty miles distant, from which\r\nthey must have been drifted to their present position. This boulder\r\nbelt, which extends from the lowest tide mark about fifty feet or\r\nmore upward, is sometimes piled in ridges and sometimes flattened out\r\ninto a rude pavement. It is a product of the modern field ice, which,\r\nattaining a great thickness in winter, has boulders frozen into its\r\nbottom, and floating up and down with the tide, deposits these on the\r\nshore. At Little Metis, two hundred miles below Quebec, where I have a\r\nsummer residence, I have from year to year cleared a passage through\r\nthe boulder belt for bathing and for launching boats, and nearly every\r\nspring I find that boulders have been thrown into the cleared space\r\nby the ice, while one can notice from year to year differences in the\r\nposition of very large boulders.\r\n\r\nIf we pass inland from the shore belt of boulders, we shall find\r\nsimilar appearances on the inland terraces at various heights, up to\r\nat least 400 feet. These are inland boulder belts belonging to old\r\nshores now elevated. Like the modern boulder belt these inland belts\r\nand patches consist partly of Laurentian rocks from the North Shore,\r\npartly of sandstones and conglomerates in place near to their present\r\nsites. In some places the stones are smaller than those of the present\r\nbeach, in other places of gigantic size. These boulders lie not only\r\non the bare rock striated in places with ice grooves pointing to the\r\nnorth-north-east; but on the old till or boulder clay, which also\r\nabounds with boulders, and which is more ancient than the superficial\r\nboulder drift. Locally we find here and there masses of fossiliferous\r\nlimestone which must have been derived from the high ground to the\r\nsouth of the St. Lawrence, and which have been borne northward either\r\nby drift ice or by local glaciers.\r\n\r\nIf now we study the polished and scored surfaces of rocks in the St.\r\nLawrence valley and the bounding hills, we shall find that while the\r\nformer testify to a great movement of ice and boulders up the river\r\nfrom the north-east, the latter show evident signs of the movement\r\nof local glaciers down the valleys of the Laurentide hills to the\r\nsouth, and on the continuation of the Appalachians south of the river\r\nsimilar evidence of the movement of land ice to the north. Thus we\r\nhave evidence of the combined action of local glaciers and floating\r\nice. To add to all this, we can find on the flat tops of the hard\r\nsandstone boulders on the beach the scratches made by the ice of last\r\nwinter, often in the same north-easterly direction with those of the\r\nPleistocene time.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the ice formed in winter in the St. Lawrence itself,\r\nthe snow-clad hills of Greenland send down to the sea great glaciers,\r\nwhich in the bays and fiords of that inhospitable region form at their\r\nextremities huge cliffs of everlasting ice, and annually \"calve,\" as\r\nthe seamen say, or give off a great progeny of ice islands, which,\r\nslowly drifted to the southward by the arctic current, pass along the\r\nAmerican coast, diffusing a cold and bleak atmosphere, until they melt\r\nin the warm waters of the Gulf Stream. Many of these bergs enter the\r\nStraits of Belle-Isle, for the Arctic current clings closely to the\r\ncoast, and a part of it seems to be deflected into the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence through this passage, carrying with it many large bergs. The\r\nvoyager passing through this strait in clear weather may see numbers\r\nof these ice islands glistening in snowy whiteness, or showing deep\r\ngreen cliffs and pinnacles--sometimes with layers of earthy matter\r\nand stones, or dotted with numerous sea birds, which rest upon them\r\nwhen gorged with the food afforded by shoals of fish and others marine\r\nanimals which haunt these cold seas. In early summer the bergs are\r\nmassive in form, often with flat tops, but as the summer advances they\r\nbecome eroded by the sun and warm winds, till they present the most\r\ngrotesque forms of rude towers and spires rising from broad foundations\r\nlittle elevated above the water.\r\n\r\nMr. Vaughan, late superintendent of the Lighthouse at Belle-Isle, has\r\nkept a register of icebergs for several years. He states that for ten\r\nwhich enter the straits, fifty drift to the southward, and that most\r\nof those which enter pass inward on the north side of the island,\r\ndrift toward the western end of the straits, and then pass out on the\r\nsouth side of the island, so that the straits seem to be merely a sort\r\nof eddy in the course of the bergs. The number in the straits varies\r\nmuch in different seasons of the year. The greatest number are seen\r\nin spring, especially in May and June; and toward autumn and in the\r\nwinter very few remain. Those which remain until autumn are reduced\r\nto mere skeletons; but if they survive until winter, they again grow\r\nin dimensions, owing to the accumulations upon them of snow and new\r\nice. Those that we saw early in July were large and massive in their\r\nproportions. The few that remained when we returned in September were\r\nsmaller in size, and cut into fantastic and toppling pinnacles. Vaughan\r\nrecords that on the 30th of May, 1858, he counted in the Straits of\r\nBelle-Isle 496 bergs, the least of them sixty feet in height, some of\r\nthem half a mile long and 200 feet high. Only one-eighth of the volume\r\nof floating ice appears above water, and many of these great bergs may\r\nthus touch the ground in a depth of thirty fathoms or more, so that if\r\nwe imagine four hundred of them moving up and down under the influence\r\nof the current, oscillating slowly with the motion of the sea, and\r\ngrinding on the rocks and stone-covered bottom at all depths from the\r\ncentre of the channel, we may form some conception of the effects of\r\nthese huge polishers of the sea floor.\r\n\r\nOf the bergs which pass outside of the straits, many ground on the\r\nbanks off Belle-Isle. Vaughan has seen a hundred large bergs aground\r\nat one time on the banks, and they ground on various parts of the\r\nbanks of Newfoundland, and all along the coast of that island. As they\r\nare borne by the deep-seated cold current, and are scarcely at all\r\naffected by the wind, they move somewhat uniformly in a direction from\r\nnorth-east to south-west, and when they touch the bottom, the striation\r\nor grooving which they produce must be in that direction.\r\n\r\nIn passing through the straits in July, I have seen great numbers of\r\nbergs, some low and flat-topped, with perpendicular sides, others\r\nconvex or roof-shaped, like great tents pitched on the sea; others\r\nrounded in outline or rising into towers and pinnacles. Most of them\r\nwere of a pure dead white, like loaf sugar, shaded with pale bluish\r\ngreen in the great rents and recent fractures. One of them seemed as\r\nif it had grounded and then overturned, presenting a flat and scored\r\nsurface covered with sand and earthy matter.\r\n\r\nAt present we wish to regard the icebergs of Belle-Isle in their\r\ncharacter of geological agents. Viewed in this aspect, they are in\r\nthe first place parts of the cosmical arrangements for equalizing\r\ntemperature, and for dispersing the great accumulations of ice in the\r\nArctic regions, which might otherwise unsettle the climatic and even\r\nthe static equilibrium of our globe, as they are believed by some\r\nimaginative physicists and geologists to have done in the so-called\r\nglacial period. If the ice islands in the Atlantic, like lumps of ice\r\nin a pitcher of water, chill our climate in spring, they are at the\r\nsame time agents in preventing a still more serious secular chilling\r\nwhich might result from the growth without limit of the Arctic snow\r\nand ice. They are also constantly employed in wearing down the Arctic\r\nland, and aided by the great northern current from Davis's Straits, in\r\nscattering stones, boulders and sand over the banks along the American\r\ncoast. Incidentally to this work, they smooth and level the higher\r\nparts of the sea bottom, and mark it with furrows and striæ indicative\r\nof the direction of their own motion.\r\n\r\nWhen we examine a chart of the American coast, and observe the deep\r\nchannel and hollow submarine valleys of the Arctic current, and the\r\nsandbanks which extend parallel to this channel from the great bank\r\nof Newfoundland to Cape Cod, we cannot avoid the conclusion that the\r\nArctic current and its ice have great power both of excavation and\r\ndeposition. On the one hand, deep hollows are cut out where the current\r\nflows over the bottom, and on the other, great banks are heaped up\r\nwhere the ice thaws and the force of the current is abated. I have\r\nbeen much struck with the worn and abraded appearance of stones and\r\ndead shells taken up from the banks off the American coast, and am\r\nconvinced that an erosive power comparable to that of a river carrying\r\nsand over its bed, and materially aided by the grinding action of ice,\r\nis constantly in action under the waters of the Arctic current.[159]\r\nThe unequal pressure resulting from this deposition and abrasion is\r\nnot improbably connected with the slight earthquakes experienced in\r\nEastern America, and also with the slow depression of the coast; and\r\nif we go back to that earliest of all geological periods when the\r\nLaurentian rocks of Sir Wm. Logan, constituting the Labrador coast and\r\nthe Laurentide Hills, were alone above water, we may even attribute in\r\nno small degree to the Arctic current of that old time the heaping up\r\nof those thousands of feet of deposits which now constitute the great\r\nrange of the Alleghany and Appalachian mountains, and form the breast\r\nbone of the American continent. In those ancient times also large\r\nstones were floated southward, and enter into the composition of very\r\nold conglomerates.\r\n\r\n[159] At the time when this was written I had only studied stones\r\nbrought up accidentally by fishermen and others from the banks of\r\nNewfoundland and elsewhere. At a later date Murray of the _Challenger_\r\nhas given more ample material. He states that the bottom in the\r\nLabrador current, 100 miles from land, was found to be blue mud with\r\n60 per cent, of sand and stones; and mentions a block of syenite\r\nweighing 490 lbs. taken up in 1,340 fathoms, and stones and pebbles\r\nof quartzite, limestone, dolomite, mica schist and serpentine, one\r\nof which was glaciated. This is the modern boulder clay produced by\r\nGreenland glaciers and the field ice of Baffin's Bay and the Labrador\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nBut such large speculations might soon carry us far from Belle-Isle,\r\nand to bring us back to the American coast and to the domain of common\r\nthings, we may note that a vast variety of marine life exists in the\r\ncold waters of the Arctic current, and that this is one of the reasons\r\nof the great and valuable fisheries of Labrador, Newfoundland and Nova\r\nScotia, regions in which the sea thus becomes the harvest field of much\r\nof the human population. On the Arctic current and its ice also floats\r\nto the southward the game of the sealers of St. John and the whalers of\r\nGaspé.\r\n\r\nWe may now proceed to connect these statements as to the distribution\r\nof icebergs, with the glaciated condition of our continents, with the\r\nremarkable fact that the same effects now produced by the ice and\r\nthe Arctic current in the Strait of Belle-Isle and the deep-current\r\nchannel off the American coast, are visible all over the North American\r\nand European land north of forty degrees of latitude, and that there\r\nis evidence that the St. Lawrence valley itself was once a gigantic\r\nBelle-Isle, in which thousands of bergs worked perhaps for thousands\r\nof years, grinding and striating its rocks, cutting out its deeper\r\nparts, and heaping up in it quantities of northern _débris_. Out of\r\nthis fact of the so-called glaciated condition of the surface of our\r\ncontinents has, however, arisen one of the great controversies of\r\nmodern geology. While all admit the action of ice in distributing and\r\narranging the materials which constitute the last coating which has\r\nbeen laid upon the surface of our continents, some maintain that land\r\nglaciers have done the work, others, that sea-borne ice has been the\r\nmain agent employed. As in some other controversies, the truth seems to\r\nlie between the extremes. Glaciers are slow, inactive, and limited in\r\ntheir sphere. Floating ice is locomotive and far-travelled, extending\r\nits action to great distances from its sources. So far, the advantages\r\nare in favour of the flotation. But the work which the glacier does is\r\ndone thoroughly, and, time and facilities being given, it may be done\r\nover wide areas. Again, the iceberg is the child of the glacier, and\r\ntherefore the agency of the one is indirectly that of the other. Thus,\r\nin any view we must plough with both of these geological oxen, and the\r\ncontroversy becomes like that old one of the Neptunists and Plutonists,\r\nwhich has been settled by admitting both water and heat to have been\r\ninstrumental in the formation of rocks.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these controversies a geologist resident in Great\r\nBritain or Canada should have some certain doctrine as to the\r\nquestion whether at that period, geologically recent, which we call\r\nthe Pleistocene period, the land was raised to a great height above\r\nthe sea, and covered like Greenland with a mantle of perpetual ice,\r\nor whether it was, like the strait of Belle-Isle and the banks of\r\nNewfoundland, under water, and annually ground over by icebergs,\r\nor whether, as now seems more probable, it was in part composed of\r\nelevated ridges covered with snow and sending down glaciers, and partly\r\ndepressed under the level of ice-laden straits and seas.\r\n\r\nA great advocate of the glacier theory has said that we cannot\r\nproperly appreciate his view without exploring thoroughly the present\r\nglaciers of Greenland and ascertaining their effects. This I have not\r\nhad opportunity to do, but I have endeavoured to do the next best thing\r\nby passing as rapidly as possible from the icebergs of Belle-Isle to\r\nthe glaciers of Mont Blanc, and by asking the question whether Canada\r\nwas in the Pleistocene period like the present Belle-Isle or the\r\npresent Mont Blanc, or whether it partook of the character of both? and\r\ntaking advantage of these two most salient points in order to elicit a\r\nreply.\r\n\r\nTransporting ourselves, then, to the monarch of the Alps, let us\r\nsuppose we stand upon the Flegere, a spur of the mountains fronting\r\nMont Blanc, and commanding a view of the entire group. From this point\r\nthe western end of the range presents the rounded summit of Mont Blanc\r\nproper, flanked by the lower eminences of the Dome and Aiguille de\r\nGouté, which rise from a broad and uneven plateau of _nevé_ or hard\r\nsnow, sending down to the plain two great glaciers or streams of ice,\r\nthe Bossons and Tacony glaciers. Eastward of Mont Blanc the _nevé_\r\nor snow plateau is penetrated by a series of sharp points of rock or\r\naiguilles, which stretch along in a row of serried peaks, and then\r\ngive place to a deep notch, through which flows the greatest of all\r\nthe glaciers of this side of Mont Blanc, the celebrated Mer de Glace,\r\ndirectly in front of our standpoint. To the left of this is another\r\nmass of aiguilles, culminating in the Aiguille Verte. This second group\r\nof needles descends into the long and narrow Glacier of Argentiere,\r\nand beyond this we see in the distance the Glacier and Aiguille de\r\nTour. As seen from this point, it is evident that the whole system of\r\nthe Mont Blanc glaciers originates in a vast mantle of snow capping\r\nthe ridge of the chain, and extending about twenty miles in length,\r\nwith a breadth of about five miles. This mass of snow being above the\r\nlimits of perpetual frost, would go on increasing from year to year,\r\nexcept so far as it might be diminished by the fall of avalanches from\r\nits sides, were it not that its plasticity is sufficient to enable the\r\nfrozen mass to glide slowly down the valleys, changing in its progress\r\ninto an icy stream, which, descending to the plain, melts at its base\r\nand discharges itself in a torrent of white muddy water. The Mont Blanc\r\nchain sends forth about a dozen of large glaciers of this kind, besides\r\nmany smaller ones. Crossing the valley of Chamouni, and ascending\r\nthe Montanvert to a height of about 6,000 feet, let us look more\r\nparticularly at one of these glaciers, the Mer de Glace. It is a long\r\nvalley with steep sides, about half a mile wide, and filled with ice,\r\nwhich presents a general level or slightly inclined surface, traversed\r\nwith innumerable transverse cracks or crevasses, penetrating apparently\r\nto the bottom of the glacier, and with slippery sloping edges of moist\r\nice threatening at every step to plunge the traveller into the depths\r\nbelow. Still the treacherous surface is daily crossed by parties of\r\ntravellers, apparently without any accident. The whole of the ice is\r\nmoving steadily along the slope on which it rests, at the rate of eight\r\nto ten inches daily--the rate of motion is less in winter and greater\r\nin summer; and farther down, where the glacier goes by the name of the\r\nGlacier du Bois, and descends a steeper slope, its rapidity is greater;\r\nand at the same time by the opening of immense crevasses its surface\r\nprojects in fantastic ridges and pinnacles. The movements and changes\r\nin the ice of these glaciers are in truth very remarkable, and show a\r\nmobility and plasticity which at first sight we should not have been\r\nprepared to expect in a solid like ice.[160] The crevasses become open\r\nor closed, curved upwards or downwards, perpendicular or inclined,\r\naccording to the surface upon which the glacier is moving, and the\r\nwhole mass is crushed upward or flattens out, its particles evidently\r\nmoving on each other with much the same result as would take place in\r\na mass of thick mud similarly moving. On the surface of the ice there\r\nare a few boulders and many stones, and in places these accumulate in\r\nlong irregular bands indicating the lines of junction of the minor ice\r\nstreams coming in from above to join the main glacier. At the sides\r\nare two great mounds of rubbish, much higher than the present surface\r\nof the glacier. They are called the lateral moraines, and consist of\r\nboulders, stones, gravel and sand, confusedly intermingled, and for the\r\nmost part retaining their sharp angles. This mass of rubbish is moved\r\ndownward by the glacier, and with the stones constituting the central\r\nmoraine, is discharged at the lower end, accumulating there in the\r\nmass of detritus known as the terminal moraine.\r\n\r\n[160] I need scarcely say that I adopt the explanation of glacier\r\nmotion given by Forbes. \"The fuller consideration of the physical\r\nproperties of glacier ice leads essentially to the same conclusions\r\nas those to which Forbes was led forty-one years ago by the study of\r\nthe larger phenomena of glacier motion, that is, that the motion is\r\nthat of a slightly viscous mass, partly sliding upon its bed, partly\r\nshearing upon itself under the influence of gravity.\"--Trotter, _Proc.\r\nRoyal Society of London_, xxxviii. 107.\r\n\r\nGlaciers have been termed rivers of ice; but there is one respect in\r\nwhich they differ remarkably from rivers. They are broad above and\r\nnarrow below, or rather, their width above corresponds to the drainage\r\narea of a river. This is well seen in a map of the Mer de Glace. From\r\nits termination in the Glacier du Bois to the top of the Mer de Glace\r\nproper, a distance of about three and a half miles, its breadth does\r\nnot exceed half a mile, but above this point it spreads out into three\r\ngreat glaciers, the Geant, the Du Chaud, and the Talefre, the aggregate\r\nwidth of which is six or seven miles. The snow and ice of a large\r\ninterior table-land or series of wide valleys are thus emptied into\r\none narrow ravine, and pour their whole accumulations through the Mer\r\nde Glace. Leaving, however, the many interesting phenomena connected\r\nwith the motion of glaciers, and which have been so well interpreted\r\nby Saussure, Agassiz, Forbes, Hopkins, Tyndall, and others, we may\r\nconsider their effects on the mountain valleys in which they operate.\r\n\r\n1. They carry quantities of _débris_ from the hill tops and mountain\r\nvalleys downward into the plains. From every peak, cliff and ridge the\r\nfrost and thaw are constantly loosening stones and other matters which\r\nare swept by avalanches to the surface of the glacier, and constitute\r\nlateral moraines. When two or more glaciers unite into one, these\r\nbecome medial moraines, and at length are spread over and through the\r\nwhole mass of the ice. Eventually all this material, including stones\r\nof immense size, as well as fine sand and mud, is deposited in the\r\nterminal moraine, or carried off by the streams.\r\n\r\n2. They are mills for grinding and triturating rock. The pieces of rock\r\nin the moraine are, in the course of their movement, crushed against\r\none another and the sides of the valley, and are cracked and ground\r\nas if in a crushing mill. Further the stones on the surface of the\r\nglacier are ever falling into crevasses, and thus reach the bottom of\r\nthe ice, where they are further ground one against another and the\r\nfloor of rock. In the movement of the glacier these stones seem in\r\nsome cases to come again to the surface, and their remains are finally\r\ndischarged in the terminal moraine, which is the waste-heap of this\r\ngreat mill: The fine material which has been produced, the flour of the\r\nmill, so to speak, becomes diffused in the water which is constantly\r\nflowing from beneath the glacier, and for this reason all the streams\r\nflowing from glaciers are turbid with whitish sand and mud.\r\n\r\nThe Arve, which drains the glaciers of the north side of Mont Blanc,\r\ncarries its burden of mud into the Rhone, which sweeps it, with the\r\nsimilar material of many other Alpine streams, into the Mediterranean,\r\nto aid in filling up the bottom of that sea, whose blue waters\r\nit discolours for miles from the shore, and to increase its own\r\never-enlarging delta, which encroaches on the sea at the rate of about\r\nhalf a mile per century. The upper waters of the Rhone, laden with\r\nsimilar material, are filling up the Lake of Geneva; and the great\r\ndeposit of \"loess\" in the alluvial plain of the Rhine, about which Gaul\r\nand German have contended since the dawn of European history, is of\r\nsimilar origin. The mass of material which has thus been carried off\r\nfrom the Alps, would suffice to build up a great mountain chain. Thus,\r\nby the action of ice and water--\r\n\r\n  \"The mountain falling cometh to naught,\r\n   And the rock is removed out of its place.\"\r\n\r\nMany observers who have commented on these facts have taken it for\r\ngranted that the mud thus sent off from glaciers, and which is so\r\nmuch greater in amount than the matter remaining in their moraines,\r\nmust be ground from the bottom of the glacier valleys, and hence have\r\nattributed to these glaciers great power of cutting out and deepening\r\ntheir valleys. But this is evidently an error, just as it would be\r\nan error to suppose the flour of a grist mill ground out of the mill\r\nstones. Glaciers, it is true, groove and striate and polish the rocks\r\nover which they move, and especially those of projecting points and\r\nslight elevations in their beds; but the material which they grind up\r\nis principally derived from the exposed frost-bitten rocks above them,\r\nand the rocky floor under the glacier is merely the nether mill stone\r\nagainst which those loose stones are crushed. The glaciers, in short,\r\ncan scarcely be regarded as cutting agents at all, in so far as the\r\nsides and bottoms of their beds are concerned, and in the valleys which\r\nthe old glaciers have abandoned, it is evident that the torrents which\r\nhave succeeded them have far greater cutting power.\r\n\r\nThe glaciers have their periods of advance and of recession. A series\r\nof wet and cool summers causes them to advance and encroach on the\r\nplains, pushing before them their moraines, and even forests and human\r\nhabitations. In dry and warm summers they shrink and recede. Such\r\nchanges seem to have occurred in bygone times on a gigantic scale. All\r\nthe valleys below the present glaciers present traces of former glacier\r\naction. Even the Jura mountains seem at one time to have had glaciers.\r\nLarge blocks from the Alps have been carried across the intervening\r\nvalley and lodged at great heights, on the slopes of the Jura, leading\r\nthe majority of the Swiss and Italian geologists to believe that even\r\nthis great valley and the basin of Lake Leman were once filled with\r\nglacier ice. But, unless we can suppose that the Alps were then vastly\r\nhigher than at present, this seems scarcely to be physically possible,\r\nand it seems more likely that the conditions were just the reverse\r\nof those supposed, namely, that the low land was submerged, and that\r\nthe valley of Lake Leman was a strait like Belle-Isle, traversed by\r\npowerful currents and receiving icebergs from both Jurassic and Alpine\r\nglaciers, and probably from farther north. One or other supposition\r\nis required to account for the appearances, which may be explained on\r\neither view. The European hills may have been higher and colder, and\r\nchanges of level elsewhere may have combined with this to give a cold\r\nclimate with moisture; or a great submergence may have left the hills\r\nas islands, and may have so reduced the temperature by the influx of\r\narctic currents and ice, as to enable the Alpine glaciers to descend to\r\nthe level of the sea. Now, we have evidence of such submergence in the\r\nbeds of sea-shells and travelled boulders scattered over Europe, while\r\nwe also have evidence of contemporaneous glaciers, in their traces on\r\nthe hills of Wales and Scotland and elsewhere, where they do not now\r\noccur.\r\n\r\nI have long maintained that in America all the observed facts imply\r\na climate no colder than that which would have resulted from the\r\nsubsidence which we know to have occurred in the temperate latitudes\r\nin the Pleistocene period, and though I would not desire to speak so\r\npositively about Europe, I confess to a strong impression that the\r\nsame is the case there, and that the casing of glacier ice imagined\r\nby many geologists, as well as the various hypotheses which have been\r\ndevised to account for it, and to avoid the mechanical, meteorological,\r\nand astronomical difficulties attending it, are alike gratuitous and\r\nchimerical, as not being at all required to account for observed facts,\r\nand being contradictory, when carefully considered, to known physical\r\nlaws as well as geological phenomena.[161]\r\n\r\n[161] _Canadian Naturalist_, vols. viii. and ix. _Geological Magazine_,\r\nDecember, 1865.\r\n\r\nCarrying with me a knowledge of the phenomena of the glacial drift as\r\nthey exist in North America, and of the modern ice drift on its shores,\r\nI was continually asking myself the question To what extent do the\r\nphenomena of glacier drift and erosion resemble these? and standing on\r\nthe moraine of the Bosson glacier, which struck me as more like boulder\r\nclay than anything else I saw in the Alps, with the exception of some\r\nrecent avalanches, I jotted down what appeared to me to be the most\r\nimportant points of difference. They stand thus:--\r\n\r\n1. Glaciers heap up their _débris_ in abrupt ridges. Floating ice\r\nsometimes does this, but more usually spreads its load in a more or\r\nless uniform sheet.[162]\r\n\r\n[162] Under floating ice I include floe, pack, and bordage ice as well\r\nas bergs.\r\n\r\n2. The material of moraines is all local. Floating ice carries its\r\ndeposits often to great distances from their sources.\r\n\r\n3. The stones carried by glaciers are mostly angular, except where they\r\nhave been acted on by torrents. Those moved by floating ice are more\r\noften rounded, being acted on by the waves and by the abrading action\r\nof sand drifted by currents.\r\n\r\n4. In the marine glacial deposits mud is mixed with stones and\r\nboulders. In the case of land glaciers, most of this mud is carried off\r\nby streams and deposited elsewhere.\r\n\r\n5. The deposits from floating ice may contain marine shells. Those\r\nof glaciers cannot, except where, as in Greenland and Spitzbergen,\r\nglaciers push their moraines out into the sea.\r\n\r\n6. It is of the nature of glaciers to flow in the deepest ravines they\r\ncan find, and such ravines drain the ice of extensive areas of mountain\r\nland. Floating ice, on the contrary, acts with greatest ease on flat\r\nsurfaces or slight elevations in the sea bottom.\r\n\r\n7. Glaciers must descend slopes and must be backed by large supplies of\r\nperennial snow. Floating ice acts independently, and being water-borne\r\nmay work up slopes and on level surfaces.\r\n\r\n8. Glaciers striate the sides and bottoms of their ravines very\r\nunequally, acting with great force and effect only on those places\r\nwhere their weight impinges most heavily. Floating ice, on the\r\ncontrary, being carried by constant currents and over comparatively\r\nflat surfaces, must striate and grind more regularly over large areas,\r\nand with less reference to local inequalities of surface.\r\n\r\n9. The direction of the striæ and grooves produced by glaciers depends\r\non the direction of valleys. That of floating ice, on the contrary,\r\ndepends upon the direction of marine currents, which is not determined\r\nby the outline of the surface, but is influenced by the large and wide\r\ndepressions of the sea bottom.\r\n\r\n10. When subsidence of the land is in progress, floating ice may carry\r\nboulders from lower to higher levels. Glaciers cannot do this under any\r\ncircumstances, though in their progress they may leave blocks perched\r\non the tops of peaks and ridges.\r\n\r\nI believe that in all these points of difference the boulder clay and\r\ndrift on the lower lands of Canada and other parts of North America,\r\ncorrespond rather with the action of floating ice than of land ice;\r\nthough certainly with glaciers on such land as existed at the different\r\nstages of the submergence, and these glaciers drifting stones and\r\nearthy matter in different directions from higher land toward the sea.\r\nMore especially is this the case in the character of the striated\r\nsurfaces, the bedded distribution of the deposits, the transport of\r\nmaterial up the natural slope, the presence of marine shells, and the\r\nmechanical and chemical characters of the boulder clay. In short, those\r\nwho regard the Canadian boulder clay as a glacier deposit, can only do\r\nso by overlooking essential points of difference between it and modern\r\naccumulations of this kind.\r\n\r\nI would wish it here to be distinctly understood, that I do not doubt\r\nthat at the time of the greatest Pleistocene submergence of Eastern\r\nAmerica, at which time I believe the greater part of the boulder clay\r\nwas formed, and the more important striation effected, the higher\r\nhills then standing as islands would be capped with perpetual snow,\r\nand through a great part of the year surrounded with heavy field and\r\nbarrier ice, and that in those hills there might be glaciers of greater\r\nor less extent. Further, it should be understood that I regard the\r\nboulder clays of the St. Lawrence valley as of different ages, ranging\r\nfrom those of the early Pleistocene to that now forming in the Gulf\r\nof St. Lawrence; and that during these periods great changes of level\r\noccurred. Further, that this boulder clay shows in every place where I\r\nhave been able to examine it, evidence of subaqueous accumulation, in\r\nthe presence of marine shells or in the unweathered state of the rocks\r\nand minerals enclosed in it; conditions which, in my view, preclude\r\nany reference of it to glacier action, except possibly in some cases\r\nto that of glaciers stretching from the land over the margin of the\r\nsea, and forming under water a deposit equivalent in character to the\r\n_bone glaciare_ of the bottom of the Swiss glaciers. But such a deposit\r\nmust have been local, and would not be easily distinguishable from\r\nthe marine boulder clay. It is of some interest to compare Canadian\r\ndeposits with those of Scotland,[163] which in character and relations\r\nso closely resemble those of Canada; but I confess several of the facts\r\nlead me to infer that much of what has been regarded as of subaërial\r\norigin in that country must really be marine, though whether deposited\r\nby icebergs or by the fronts of glaciers terminating in the sea, I do\r\nnot pretend to determine.[164] It must, however, be observed that the\r\nantecedent probability of a glaciated condition is much greater in\r\nthe case of Scotland than in that of Canada, from the high northern\r\nlatitude of the former, its hilly and maritime character, and the fact\r\nthat its present exemption from glaciers is due to what may be termed\r\nexceptional and accidental geographical conditions; more especially\r\nto the distribution of the waters of the Gulf Stream, which might be\r\nchanged by a comparatively small subsidence in Central America. To\r\nassume the former existence of glaciers in a country in north latitude\r\n56°, and with its highest hills, under the present exceptionally\r\nfavourable conditions, snow-capped during most of the year, is a very\r\ndifferent thing from assuming a covering of continental ice over wide\r\nplains more than ten degrees farther south, and in which, even under\r\nvery unfavourable geographical accidents, no snow can endure the summer\r\nsun, even in mountains several thousand feet high. Were the plains\r\nof North America submerged and invaded by the cold arctic currents,\r\nthe Gulf Stream being at the same time turned into the Pacific, the\r\ntemperature of the remaining North American land would be greatly\r\ndiminished; but under these circumstances the climate of Scotland\r\nwould necessarily be reduced to the same condition with that of South\r\nGreenland or Northern Labrador. As we know such a submergence of\r\nAmerica to have occurred in the Pleistocene period, it does not seem\r\nnecessary to have recourse to any other cause for either side of the\r\nAtlantic. It would, however, be a very interesting point to determine,\r\nwhether in the Pleistocene period the greatest submergence of America\r\ncoincided with the greatest submergence of Europe, or otherwise. It\r\nis quite possible that more accurate information on this point might\r\nremove some present difficulties. I think it much to be desired that\r\nthe many able observers now engaged on the Pleistocene of Europe,\r\nwould at least keep before their minds the probable effects of the\r\ngeographical conditions above referred to, and inquire whether a due\r\nconsideration of these would not allow them to dispense altogether with\r\nthe somewhat extravagant theories of glaciation now agitated.\r\n\r\n[163] _Journal of Geological Society._ Papers by Jamieson, Bryce,\r\nCrosskey, and Geikie.\r\n\r\n[164] Geikie, _Trans. Royal Society of Edin._ Geikie assigns a more\r\ncomplicated structure than appears to be present in Canada; but there\r\nare Canadian equivalents of the principal glacial periods which he\r\nassumes.\r\n\r\nThe preceding pages give the substance of my conclusions of\r\ntwenty-four years ago. I give those of to-day from a paper of\r\n1891,[165] relating to Eastern Canada only:--\r\n\r\n[165] Supplement to 4th edition of \"Acadian Geology,\" 1891.\r\n\r\nThese conclusions have, in my judgment, been confirmed, and their\r\nbearing extended, more especially by the researches of Mr. Chalmers,\r\nwho has shown in the most convincing way that glaciers proceeding from\r\nlocal centres along with sea-borne ice, may have been the agents in\r\nglaciating surfaces and transporting boulders in Nova Scotia and New\r\nBrunswick. Taken in connection with the observations of Dr. Dawson\r\nand Mr. McConnell in the Cordillera region of the west, and those of\r\nDr. Bell, Dr. Ells, Mr. Low, and others in the Laurentian country\r\nnorth of the St. Lawrence, and in the Province of Quebec, we may now\r\nbe said to know that there was not, even at the height of the glacial\r\nrefrigeration of America, a continental ice sheet, but rather several\r\ndistinct centres of ice action,--one in the Cordillera of the West,\r\none on the Laurentian V-shaped axis, and one on the Appalachians, with\r\nsubordinate centres on isolated masses like the Adirondacks, and at\r\ncertain periods even on minor hills like those of Nova Scotia. It would\r\nfurther seem that, in the west at least, elevation of the mountain\r\nridges coincided with depression of the plains. In Newfoundland also,\r\nit would appear from the observations of Captain Kerr, with which those\r\nof Mr. Murray are in harmony,[166] though they have been differently\r\ninterpreted, that the gathering ground of ice was in the interior\r\nof the island, and that glaciers moved thence to the coasts, but\r\nprincipally to the east coast, as was natural from the conformation of\r\nthe land and the greater supply of moisture from the Atlantic.\r\n\r\n[166] _Trans. Royal Society of Canada_, vol. i.\r\n\r\nThe labours of Murray in Newfoundland, of Matthew, Chalmers, Bailey,\r\nand others, in Nova Scotia and New Brunswick, have considerably\r\nenlarged our knowledge of Pleistocene fossils, showing, however, that\r\nthe marine fauna is the same with that of the beds of like age in the\r\nSt. Lawrence valley, and with the existing fauna of the Labrador coast\r\nand colder portions of the Gulf and River St. Lawrence, as ascertained\r\nby Prickard, Whiteaves, and the writer. It would seem that throughout\r\nthis region, the 60 feet and the 600 feet terraces were the most\r\nimportant with reference to these marine remains, and that their chief\r\nrepository is in the Upper Leda Clay, a marine deposit intermediate\r\nbetween the Lower and Upper boulder drift, and corresponding to the\r\ninterglacial beds of the interior of America.\r\n\r\nThe general conditions of the period may be thus summarized:--\r\n\r\nIn this district, and the eastern part of North America generally, it\r\nis, I think, universally admitted that the later Pliocene period was\r\none of continental elevation, and probably of temperate climate. The\r\nevidence of this is too well known to require re-statement here. It is\r\nalso evident, from the raised beaches holding marine shells, extending\r\nto elevations of 600 feet, and from drift boulders reaching to a far\r\ngreater height, that extensive submergence occurred in the middle and\r\nlater Pleistocene. This was the age of the beds I have named the _Leda_\r\nclays and _Saxicava_ sands, found at heights of 600 feet above the sea\r\nin the St. Lawrence valley, nearly as far west as Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to conclude that the till or boulder clay, under\r\nthe Leda clay, belongs to the earliest period of probably gradual\r\nsubsidence, accompanied with a severe climate, and with snow and\r\nglaciers on all the higher grounds, sending glaciated stones into\r\nthe sea. This deduction agrees with the marine shells, polyzoa, and\r\ncirripedes found in the boulder deposits on the lower St. Lawrence,\r\nwith the unoxidized character of the mass, which proves subaqueous\r\ndeposition, with the fact that it contains soft boulders, which would\r\nhave crumbled if exposed to the air, with its limitation to the lower\r\nlevels and absence on the hillsides, and with the prevalent direction\r\nof striation and boulder drift from the north-east.[167]\r\n\r\n[167] Notes on the Post-Pliocene _Canadian Naturalist_, _op. cit._;\r\nalso Paper by the author on Boulder Drift at Metis, _Canadian Record of\r\nScience_, vol. ii., 1886, p. 36, _et seq._\r\n\r\nAll these indications coincide with the conditions of the modern\r\nboulder drift on the lower St. Lawrence and in the Arctic regions,\r\nwhere the great belts and ridges of boulders accumulated by the coast\r\nice would, if the coast were sinking, climb upward and be filled in\r\nwith mud, forming a continuous sheet of boulder deposit similar to that\r\nwhich has accumulated and is accumulating on the shores of Smith's\r\nSound and elsewhere in the Arctic, and which, like the older boulder\r\nclay, is known to contain both marine shells and driftwood.[168]\r\n\r\n[168] For references see \"Royal Society's Arctic Manual,\" London, 1875,\r\n_op. cit._\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the deposit of \"till\" diminished in intensity as\r\nthe subsidence continued. The gathering ground of local glaciers was\r\nlessened, the ice was no longer limited to narrow sounds, but had a\r\nwider scope, as well as a freer drift to the southward, and the climate\r\nseems to have been improved. The clays deposited had few boulders and\r\nmany marine shells, and to the west and north there were land-producing\r\nplants akin to those of the temperate regions; and in places only\r\nslightly elevated above the water, peaty deposits accumulated. The\r\nshells of the Leda clay indicate depths of less than 100 fathoms.\r\nThe numerous Foraminifera, so far as have been observed, belong to\r\nthis range, and I have never seen in this clay the assemblage of\r\nforaminiferal forms now dredged from 200 to 300 fathoms in the Gulf of\r\nSt. Lawrence.\r\n\r\nI infer that the subsidence of the Leda clay period and of the\r\ninterglacial beds of Ontario belongs to the time of the sea beaches\r\nfrom 450 to 600 feet in height, which are so marked and extensive as\r\nto indicate a period of repose. In this period there were marine\r\nconditions in the lower and middle St. Lawrence and in the Ottawa\r\nvalley, and swamps and lakes on the upper Ottawa and the western end\r\nof Lake Ontario. It is quite probable, nay, certain, that during this\r\ninterglacial period re-elevation had set in, since the upper Leda\r\nclay and the Saxicava sand indicate shallowing water, and during this\r\nre-elevation the plant-covered surface would extend to lower levels.\r\n\r\nThis, however, must have been followed by a second subsidence, since\r\nthe water-worn gravels and loose, far-travelled boulders of the later\r\ndrift rose to heights never reached by the till or the Leda clay, and\r\nattained to the tops of the highest hills of the St. Lawrence valley,\r\n1,200 feet in height, and elsewhere to still greater elevations. This\r\nsecond boulder drift must have been wholly marine, and probably not\r\nof long duration. It shows no evidence of colder climate than that\r\nnow prevalent, nor of extensive glaciers on the mountains; and it was\r\nfollowed by a paroxysmal elevation in successive stages till the land\r\nattained even more than its present height, as subsidence is known to\r\nhave been proceeding in modern times.\r\n\r\nI am quite aware that the above sequence and the causes assumed are\r\nsomewhat different from those held by many geologists with reference to\r\nregions south of Canada; but must hold that they are the only rational\r\nconclusions which can be propounded with reference to the facts\r\nobserved from the parallel of 45° to the Arctic Ocean.\r\n\r\nMy own observations have been chiefly in the eastern part of North\r\nAmerica. My son, Dr. G. M. Dawson, has much more ably and thoroughly\r\nexplored those of the west; and after describing the immense\r\nCordilleran ice mass which extended for a length of 1,200 miles along\r\nthe mountains of British Columbia and discharged large glaciers to the\r\nnorth, as well as to the west and south, and stating his reasons for\r\nbelieving in that differential elevation and depression which caused\r\nthe greatest height of the mountains to coincide with the greatest\r\ndepression of the plains, and _vice versâ_, and showing the Cordilleran\r\nglacier must have been separated by a water area from that of the\r\nLaurentide hills on the east, thus concludes:--\r\n\r\n\"It is now distinctly known, as the result of work done under the\r\nauspices of the Geological Survey of Canada, and more particularly\r\nof observations by the writer and his colleagues, Messrs. McConnell\r\nand Tyrrell, that the extreme margins of the western and eastern\r\nglaciated areas of the continent barely overlap, and then only to a\r\nvery limited extent, while the two great centres of dispersion were\r\nentirely distinct. For numerous reasons which cannot be here entered\r\ninto, the writer does not consider it probable, or even possible,\r\nthat the great confluent glacier of the north-eastern part of the\r\ncontinent extended at any time far into the area of the great plains;\r\nbut erratics and drift derived from this ice mass did so extend,\r\nand are found between the 49th and 50th parallels, stranded on the\r\nsurface of moraines produced by the large local glaciers of the Rocky\r\nMountains. Recognising, however, the essential separateness of the\r\nwestern and eastern confluent ice masses, and the fact that it is no\r\nlonger appropriate to designate one of these the \"continental glacier,\"\r\nthe writer ventures to propose that the eastern _mer de glace_ may\r\nappropriately be named the great _Laurentide glacier_, while its\r\nwestern fellow is known as the \"_Cordilleran glacier_.\" It may be\r\nadded that there is good evidence to show that both the Laurentide and\r\nCordilleran glaciers discharged into open water to the north.\"\r\n\r\nThese conclusions, based on a large induction of facts applying to a\r\nvery large area of the North American Continent, coincide with my own\r\nobservations in the east, and with the inferences deducible from the\r\npresent condition of Greenland and Arctic America.\r\n\r\nWhen extreme glacialists point to Greenland and ask us to believe\r\nthat in the Glacial age the whole continent of North America, as far\r\nsouth as the latitude of 40°, was covered with a continuous glacier,\r\nhaving a wide front, and thousands of feet thick, we may well ask,\r\nfirst, what evidence there is that Greenland or even the Antarctic\r\ncontinent is at present in such a condition; and, secondly, whether\r\nthere exists a possibility that the interior of a great continent could\r\never receive so large an amount of precipitation as that required. So\r\nfar as present knowledge exists, it is certain that the meteorologist\r\nand the physicist must answer both questions in the negative. In\r\nshort, perpetual snow and glaciers must be local, and cannot be\r\ncontinental, because of the vast amount of evaporation and condensation\r\nrequired. These can only be possible where comparatively Warm seas\r\nsupply moisture to cold and elevated land, and this supply cannot, in\r\nthe nature of things, penetrate far inland. The actual condition of\r\ninterior Asia and interior America in the higher northern latitudes\r\naffords positive proof of this. In a state of partial submergence\r\nof our northern continents, we can readily imagine glaciation by\r\nthe combined action of local glaciers and great ice floes; but in\r\nwhatever way the phenomena of the boulder clay and of the so-called\r\n\"terminal moraines\" are to be accounted for, the theory of a continuous\r\ncontinental glacier must be given up.\r\n\r\nThe great interior plain of western Canada, between the Laurentian\r\naxis on the east and the Rocky Mountains on the west, is seven hundred\r\nmiles in breadth, and is covered with glacial drift, presenting one\r\nof the greatest examples of this deposit in the world. Proceeding\r\neastward from the base of the Rocky Mountains, the surface, at first\r\nmore than 4,000 feet above the sea level, descends by successive steps\r\nto 2,500 feet, and is based on Cretaceous and Laramie rocks, covered\r\nwith boulder clay and sand, in some places from one hundred to two\r\nhundred feet in depth, and filling up pre-existing hollows, though\r\nitself sometimes piled into ridges. Near the Rocky Mountains the\r\nbottom of the drift consists of gravel not glaciated. This extends\r\nto about one hundred miles east of the mountains, and must have been\r\nswept by water out of their valleys. The boulder clay resting on this\r\ndeposit is largely made up of local _débris_, in so far as its paste\r\nis concerned. It contains many glaciated boulders and stones from\r\nthe Laurentian region to the east, and also smaller pebbles from the\r\nRocky Mountains, so that at the time of its formation there must have\r\nbeen driftage of large stones for seven hundred miles or more from\r\nthe east, and of smaller stones from a less distance on the west. The\r\nformer kind of material extends to the base of the mountains, and to a\r\nheight of more than 4,000 feet. One boulder is mentioned as being 42 ×\r\n40 × 20 feet in dimensions. The highest Laurentian boulders seen were\r\nat an elevation of 4,660 feet on the base of the Rocky Mountains. The\r\nboulder clay, when thick, can be seen to be rudely stratified, and at\r\none place includes beds of laminated clay with compressed peat, similar\r\nto the forest beds described by Worthen and Andrews in Illinois, and\r\nthe so-called interglacial beds described by Hinde on Lake Ontario.\r\nThe leaf beds on the Ottawa river, and the drift trunks found in the\r\nboulder clay of Manitoba, belong to the same category, and indicate in\r\nthe midst of the Glacial period many forest oases far to the north,\r\nhaving a temperate rather than an arctic flora. In the valleys of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains opening on these plains there are evidences of\r\nlarge local glaciers now extinct, and similar evidences exist on the\r\nLaurentian highlands on the east. A recent paper of Dr. G. M. Dawson on\r\nthe Palæography of the Rocky Mountains illustrates in a most convincing\r\nmanner the changes which have occurred in the Cordillera of North\r\nAmerica, and the differential elevation and depression which have\r\naffected its climate in the later geological periods.[169]\r\n\r\n[169] _Transactions Royal Society of Canada_, 1890.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable feature of the western drift region is\r\nthat immense series of ridges of drift piled against an escarpment of\r\nLaramie and Cretaceous rocks, at an elevation of about 2,500 feet, and\r\nknown as the \"Missouri Coteau.\" It is in some places 30 miles broad\r\nand 180 feet in height above the plain at its foot, and extends north\r\nand south for a great distance: being, in fact, the northern extension\r\nof those great ridges of drift which have been traced south of the\r\ngreat lakes, and through Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and which figure\r\non the geological maps as the edge of the continental glacier--an\r\nexplanation obviously inapplicable in those western regions where\r\nthey attain their greatest development. It is plain that in the north\r\nit marks the western limit of the deep-water of a glacial sea, which\r\nat some periods extended much farther west, perhaps with a greater\r\nproportionate depression in going westward, and on which heavy ice from\r\nthe Laurentian districts on the east was wafted south-westward by the\r\narctic currents, while lighter ice from the Rocky Mountains was being\r\nborne eastward from these mountains by the prevailing westerly winds.\r\nWe thus have in the west, on a very wide scale, the same phenomena of\r\nvarying submergence, cold currents, great ice floes and local glaciers\r\nproducing icebergs, to which I have attributed the boulder clay and\r\nupper boulder drift of eastern Canada. In short, we arrive at the\r\nconclusion that there never has been a continental glacier, properly so\r\ncalled, but that in the extreme Glacial period there have been great\r\ncentres of snow and glacial action, in the Cordillera of the west, in\r\nthe Laurentian plateau of the north, and in the northern Appalachians,\r\nand the Adirondacks, while the lower lands have been either submerged,\r\nor enjoying a climate habitable by hardy animals and plants.\r\n\r\nThe till or boulder clay has been called a \"ground moraine,\" but there\r\nare really no Alpine moraines at all corresponding to it. On the other\r\nhand, it is more or less stratified, often rests on soft materials\r\nwhich glaciers would have swept away, sometimes contains marine\r\nshells, or passes into marine clays in its horizontal extension, and\r\ninvariably in its embedded boulders and its paste, shows an unoxidized\r\ncondition, which could not have existed if it had been a subaërial\r\ndeposit. When the Canadian till is excavated and exposed to the air, it\r\nassumes a brown colour, owing to oxidation of its iron, and many of its\r\nstones and boulders break up and disintegrate under the action of air\r\nand frost. These are unequivocal signs of a subaqueous deposit. Here\r\nand there we find associated with it, and especially near the bottom\r\nand at the top, indications of powerful water action, as if of land\r\ntorrents acting at particular elevations of the land, or heavy surf\r\nand ice action on coasts, and the attempts to explain these by glacial\r\nstreams have been far from successful. A singular objection sometimes\r\nraised against the subaqueous origin of the till is its general want\r\nof marine remains; but this is by no means universal, and it is well\r\nknown that coarse conglomerates of all ages are generally destitute of\r\nfossils, except in their pebbles, and it is further to be observed that\r\nthe conditions of an ice-laden sea are not those most favourable for\r\nthe extension of marine life, and that the period of time covered by\r\nthe glacial age must have been short, compared with that represented by\r\nsome of the older formations.\r\n\r\nIt follows from all this that the great \"continental moraine,\" which\r\nthe United States Geological Survey has now \"delineated for several\r\nthousand miles extending from the Atlantic to the Pacific,\" cannot be\r\na glacier moraine, but must be, like its great continuation northward,\r\nthe Missouri coteau, a margin of sea drift, and that we must explain\r\nthe whole of the drift of the American continent by the supposition,\r\nfirst, of a period of elevation of the hills and subsidence of the\r\nvalleys in which there were great accumulations of snow on the Western\r\nCordillera; the Laurentian axis, and the Appalachians and Adirondacks\r\nradiating in every direction from these points, while minor areas of\r\nradiation may have temporarily existed on smaller elevations: that\r\nthis was followed by a period of more equal level, in which parts of\r\nthe low grounds were clothed with a temperate flora, the \"Interglacial\r\nperiod\" so called, succeeded by a second great depression, in which the\r\nhigh level boulders of the second boulder drift were wafted to great\r\ndistances by floating ice.\r\n\r\nThe late Prof. Alexander Winchell, a man who did not hesitate to\r\nexpress his convictions, thus bears similar testimony:--\"There has been\r\nno continental glacier. There has been no uniform southerly movement of\r\nglacier masses. There has been no persistent declivity as a _sine qua\r\nnon_, down which glacier movements have taken place. The continuity of\r\nthe supposed continental glacier was interrupted in the regions of the\r\ndry and treeless plains of the west; and in the interior and Pacific\r\nbelts of the continent within the United States, ancient glaciation was\r\nrestricted to the elevated slopes.\"[170] He might have added that the\r\nSt. Lawrence valley was submerged and received the ends of Appalachian\r\nand Adirondack glaciers on the south-east, and those of Laurentide\r\nglaciers on the north-west.\r\n\r\n[170] Nov., 1890.\r\n\r\nMy friend Prof. Claypole, who, however, has some hesitation, fearing,\r\nI presume, to be cast out of the synagogue for heresy, ventures to\r\nsay,[171] \"We deduce from the facts and arguments stated above, that\r\nall the observations of glacial action in the northern hemisphere are\r\nexplicable by assuming the existence of enormous and confluent[172]\r\nglacier-systems in and about the high lands of Europe, Asia, and\r\nAmerica, which high lands became, therefore, glacial radiants, and shed\r\ntheir load of ice in all directions over the lower adjacent ground,\r\nalong the lines of easiest flow; that this theory does no violence\r\nto the analogy of the existing order of things, requiring merely\r\nan enlargement of actual glaciers by the intensification of actual\r\nconditions : that abundant evidence can be obtained, as, for example,\r\nfrom Switzerland, that the present glacier system of the earth was\r\nonce of sufficient magnitude to produce all the observed phenomena;\r\nthat the most important glacial radiants in the northern hemisphere\r\nwere, in North America, the district round Hudson Bay, New England\r\nand the Adirondacks, with certain areas in the western Cordilleras,\r\nand in Europe the Norwegian Dovrefelds and the Alps, Asia apparently\r\npossessing none of commensurate importance; that it satisfactorily\r\nexplains, also, the previously puzzling absence of glacial action\r\nover the great plain of Siberia, the coldest portion of the northern\r\ntemperate zone; that the belief in a vast polar ice cap, thousands of\r\nfeet thick, covering the whole Arctic region, and extending almost\r\ncontinuously down to low latitudes, is an assumption doing violence to\r\nobserved physical facts and to probability, that it is not required to\r\naccount for the phenomena, and is, in fact, contradictory to some of\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n[171] _American Geologist_, Feb., 1889.\r\n\r\n[172] The term \"confluent\" is not necessary here. The glaciers of all\r\nmountain chains may be said to be more or less confluent in the nevé,\r\nfrom which individual glaciers radiate.\r\n\r\nIn Europe there is equally good evidence of the existence of huge\r\nglaciers on the Scandinavian mountains and the Alps, and of lesser\r\naccumulations of ice on the hills, as, for instance, those of the\r\nBritish Islands; but the Scandinavian boulders scattered over the\r\nplains of Great Britain must have been water-borne.[173]\r\n\r\n[173] The reports of the Scottish boulder committee, and Lapworth's\r\nrecent careful examination of the deposits on the East of England\r\n(_Journ. Geol. Soc._, Aug., 1891), strongly confirm me in this opinion.\r\n\r\nIn connection with these extracts I would observe that the writer,\r\nand those with whom he has acted in this matter, have never held that\r\nicebergs alone, or fields of ice alone, have produced the Pleistocene\r\ndeposits. Their contention has been that the period was one in which\r\nglaciers, icebergs, and field ice acted together, and along with\r\naqueous agencies, in producing the complicated formations of this\r\nremarkable age. They have, however, objected strenuously to the sole\r\nemployment of one agent to the exclusion of others, and to attributing\r\nto that agent powers and extension which obviously could not belong to\r\nit, under the known laws which regulate the movement of glaciers by\r\nthe force of gravity, and the precipitation of moisture in the form\r\nof snow on mountains and plateaus. These laws show that the movement\r\nof glaciers over level surfaces, or against the slope of the ground,\r\nand their moving stones otherwise than down slopes, are physical\r\nimpossibilities, and that the accumulation of snow to form glaciers\r\ncan take place only on elevated and cold land, supplied with large\r\nquantities of vapour from neighbouring water. Such accumulation can\r\nunder no imaginable conditions take place in the interior plains and\r\ntable lands of great continents.\r\n\r\nApplying these laws and conclusions to the whole northern hemisphere,\r\nwe learn that the conditions to produce a glacial period are the\r\ndiversion of the warm currents from the northern seas, the submergence\r\nof land in the temperate regions, and its invasion by cold Arctic\r\nwater, and great condensation of snow on the higher lands. Whether this\r\ncondensation has a tendency finally to rectify the state of affairs, by\r\npressing down the mountains and elevating the plains, we do not know,\r\nbut I should imagine that it has not; for the high lands will, in the\r\ncase supposed, be lightened by denudation, while the plains will be\r\nburdened with a great weight of deposit. Perhaps we should rather look\r\nto this as the agency for depressing and submerging the plains and\r\nelevating the hills, and suppose some other and more general pressure\r\nproceeding from the great sea basins, to effect the re-elevation of the\r\nplains.\r\n\r\nThese questions suggest that of the date of the Glacial period. This\r\nsubject has recently been discussed by Prestwich and others, with\r\nthe result that there is no purely geological ground for referring\r\nthe Glacial age to a period so remote as that advocated by Croll on\r\nastronomical grounds. Claypole has recently discussed the matter at\r\nsome length, and in a temperate spirit.[174] He takes the rate of\r\nerosion of the Niagara gorge as a measure, and shows that the Falls\r\nof St. Anthony, as described by Winchell, and all the other falls\r\nand river gorges in North America, give similar estimates, which are\r\nconfirmed by the evidences of lake ridges, of the rate of erosion,\r\nand of the conditions of animal and plant life. The whole go to show\r\nthat the culmination of the Glacial age may have occurred less than\r\n10,000 years ago. He further shows that the differential elevation of\r\nLakes Erie and Ontario, the greater ease with which the river could\r\ncut the lower part of its ravine, the probability that the part of the\r\ngorge between the whirlpool and the fall was not cut, but only cleaned\r\nout in modern times, and the possible greater flow of water in the\r\nearly modern period, all tend to shorten the time required, and that,\r\nas Prestwich has inferred from other data, and the writer also in\r\nvarious papers, some of them of old date, the so-called post-glacial\r\nperiod, that of the melting away of the ice, may come within 8,000 to\r\n10,000 years of our own time. Probably the first of these figures is\r\nthe nearest to the truth,[175] so that, geologically considered, the\r\nGlacial age is very recent.\r\n\r\n[174] _Trans. Edinburgh Geol. Soc._, vol. v., 1888.\r\n\r\n[175] Upham, one of the ablest and most experienced of the Glacial\r\ngeologists in the United States, in a recent paper on the causes of the\r\nglacial period, states similar conclusions, and adduces the evidence of\r\nGilbert, Andrews, Wright, Emerson and others in the same sense.\r\n\r\nStill another question of great cosmic interest relates to the possible\r\nalternation of glacial conditions in the northern and southern\r\nhemispheres. There is evidence of drift in the southern part of South\r\nAmerica, similar to that in the north; but was it deposited at the same\r\ntime? If we could be sure that it was not, many difficulties would be\r\nremoved. The southern hemisphere is at present emphatically the ocean\r\nhemisphere; the northern, the land hemisphere. Perhaps these conditions\r\nmay be capable of being reversed, in which case the periods of\r\ndepression in the south may have corresponded with those of elevation\r\nin the north. One thing which we know is, that there is a polar ice\r\nring, not an ice cap, for we do not know what is within its edges at\r\nthe South Pole, about 2,000 miles in diameter, and this in the only\r\ncircumstances in which it can exist, namely, surrounded by a vast ocean\r\nfurnishing it with abundant aqueous vapour. We also know that from this\r\nice ring radiate glaciers, carrying _débris_, with which the sea bottom\r\nis strown half way to the equator. If continents were elevated out of\r\nthe Southern Ocean, we should probably have on their surfaces glacial\r\ndeposits more widespread and continuous than any remaining on the\r\ncontinents of the northern hemisphere, and like some of them thinning\r\nout to a terminal edge or border, instead of a terminal moraine like\r\nthat of a glacier.[176] Thus we may say with some truth that the\r\nsouthern hemisphere is now passing through one phase of the Glacial\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n[176] This is now admitted by Chamberlain and others to be the case\r\nwith the oldest boulder clay on the American continent.\r\n\r\nI have often thought that in the southern hemisphere the condition\r\nof Kerguelen Island and Heard Island, as described in the reports of\r\nthe _Challenger_,[177] must very nearly represent the state of some\r\nmountain ranges and peaks in North America in the Glacial age. Heard\r\nIsland, in S. latitude 53° 2′, is a mountain peak 6,000 feet high,\r\nand 25 miles in length. It sends down large glaciers to the sea. In\r\nits larger neighbour, Kerguelen, the glaciers do not reach the sea;\r\nbut there is evidence that at one time they did. It is still more\r\ncurious that, in Kerguelen the modern ice overlies late tertiary\r\ndeposits, holding remains of large trees, indicating a more continental\r\ncondition and mild climate at no very remote period. The glaciers of\r\nHeard Island and Kerguelen have, no doubt, been carrying down moraine\r\nmaterial into the sea, and this is certainly done on a still greater\r\nscale by those of the Antarctic continent. This sends off bergs which\r\nfill the whole ocean south of 60°, and float much farther north. Some\r\nof them have been seen 2,000 feet long and 200 high, and though most\r\nof the boulders they contain are necessarily concealed, yet masses of\r\nrock, supposed to weigh many tons, have been seen on them. The whole\r\nsea bottom off this continent, as far south as 64°, consists of blue\r\nmud, with boulders and pebbles, some of them glaciated, and farther\r\nnorth there is, as far as 47 degrees of latitude, a considerable\r\npercentage of drift material, and this sometimes in depths of 1,950\r\nfathoms. It is evident that, if large areas of the southern hemisphere\r\nwere elevated into land, we should have phenomena to deal with not much\r\nunlike those of North America at present.\r\n\r\n[177] Vol. i. p. 370, etc.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no discussion carries with it more of warning to geologists\r\nto exercise caution in framing theories than this of the great ice\r\nage; and if the collapse of extreme views on this subject shall\r\nhave the effect of inducing geologists to keep within the limits of\r\nwell-ascertained facts and sound induction, to adhere to the Lyellian\r\ndoctrine of modern causes to explain ancient phenomena, and to bear\r\nin mind that most great effects involve not one cause, but many\r\nco-operating causes, it may lead to consequences beneficial to science;\r\nand so, emerging from the cold shadows of the continental glacier, we\r\nmay find ourselves in the sunshine of truth.\r\n\r\n  References:--\"Acadian Geology,\" 1st ed., 1855; 4th ed., 1892.\r\n    Icebergs of Belle-Isle, and Glaciers of Mont Blanc, _Canadian\r\n    Naturalist_, 1865. \"Notes on Pleistocene of Canada,\" Montreal,\r\n    1871.

It ought\r\nto have been settled, but up to to-day one finds in geological works\r\nand papers--especially those relating to the Glacial age--the most\r\ndivergent views; and in the writings of men not geologists, it is not\r\nunusual to find exploded theories gravely stated as established facts\r\nof science. The subject is one which I cannot hope to make interesting,\r\nbut if the reader will wade through a short chapter, he will be able\r\nto find some of the data on which statements on this subject in other\r\npapers of this series are based.\r\n\r\nMr. Searles V. Wood, in an able summary of the possible causes of\r\nthe succession of cold and warm climates in the northern hemisphere,\r\nenumerates no fewer than seven theories which have met with more or\r\nless acceptance, and he might have added an eighth. These are:--\r\n\r\n(1) The gradual cooling of the earth from a condition of original\r\nincandescence.\r\n\r\n(2) Changes in the obliquity of the ecliptic.\r\n\r\n(3) Changes in the position of the earth's axis of rotation.\r\n\r\n(4) The effect of the precession of the equinoxes, along with changes\r\nof the eccentricity of the earth's orbit.\r\n\r\n(5) Variations in the amount of heat given off by the sun.\r\n\r\n(6) Differences in the temperature of portions of space passed through\r\nby the earth.\r\n\r\n(7) Differences in the distribution of land and water in connection\r\nwith the flow of oceanic currents.\r\n\r\n(8) Variations in the properties of the atmosphere with reference to\r\nits capacity for allowing the radiation of heat.\r\n\r\nSomething may be said in favour of all these alleged causes; but as\r\nefficient in any important degree in producing the cold and warm\r\nclimates of the Tertiary period, the greater number of them may be\r\ndismissed as incapable of effecting such results, or as altogether\r\nuncertain with reference to the fact of their own occurrence.\r\n\r\n(1) That the earth and the sun have diminished in heat during\r\ngeological time seems probable; but physical and geological facts\r\nalike render it certain that this influence could have produced no\r\nappreciable effect, even in the times of the earliest animals and\r\nplants, and certainly not in the case of Tertiary floras or faunas.\r\n\r\n(2) The obliquity of the ecliptic is not believed by astronomers to\r\nhave changed to any great degree, and its effect would be merely a\r\nsomewhat different distribution of heat in different periods of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n(3) Independently of astronomical objections, there is good geological\r\nevidence that the poles of the earth must have been nearly in their\r\npresent places from the dawn of life until now. From the Laurentian\r\nupward, those organic limestones which mark the areas where warm and\r\nshallow equatorial water was spreading over submerged continents, are\r\nso disposed as to prove the permanence of the poles. In like manner\r\nall the great foldings of the crust of the earth have followed lines\r\nwhich are parts of great circles tangent to the existing polar circles.\r\nSo, also, from the Cambrian age the great drift of sediment from the\r\nnorth has followed the line of the existing Arctic currents from the\r\nnorth-east to the south-west, throwing itself, for example, along the\r\nline of the Appalachian uplifts in Eastern America, and against the\r\nridge of the Cordilleras in the west.\r\n\r\n(4) The effects of change of eccentricity and precession have been\r\nso ably urged by Croll, and recently by Ball, and have so strongly\r\ninfluenced the minds of those who are not working geologists, that they\r\ndeserve a more detailed notice.\r\n\r\n(5) The heat of the sun is known to be variable, and the eleven years'\r\nperiod of sun spots has recently attracted much attention as producing\r\nappreciable effects on the seasons. There may possibly be longer cycles\r\nof solar energy; or the sun may be liable, like some variable stars, to\r\nparoxysms of increased energy. Such changes are possible, but we have\r\nno evidence of their occurrence, and they could not account for periods\r\nof refrigeration of limited duration like the Glacial age.\r\n\r\n(6) It has been supposed that the earth may have at different times\r\ntraversed more or less heated zones of space, giving alternations of\r\nwarm and cold temperature. No such differences in space are, however,\r\nknown, nor does there seem any good ground for imagining their\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n(7) The differences in the form and elevation of our continents, and\r\nin the consequent distribution of surfaces of different absorbent and\r\nradiating power, and of the oceanic currents, are known causes of\r\nclimatal change, and have been referred to in these papers as competent\r\nto account for many, at least, of the phenomena.\r\n\r\n(8) Reference has already been made, in connection with the\r\ndistribution of plants, to the possibility that the primeval atmosphere\r\nwas richer in carbon than that of more modern times, and that this\r\nmight operate to produce diminution of radiation, and consequent\r\nuniformity of temperature; but this cause could not have been efficient\r\nin the later geological periods.\r\n\r\nThere may thus be said to remain two theories of those enumerated\r\nby Wood, to which more detailed consideration may be given, namely,\r\nnumbers four and seven, which may be named respectively those of Croll\r\nand Lyell, or the astronomical and geographical theories.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. Croll has, in his valuable work \"Climate and Time,\" and\r\nin various memoirs, brought forward an ingenious astronomical theory\r\nto account for changes of climate. This theory, as stated by himself,\r\nis that when the eccentricity of the earth's orbit is at a high value,\r\nand the northern winter solstice is in perihelion, agencies are\r\nbrought into operation which make the south-east trade winds stronger\r\nthan the north-east, and compel them to blow over upon the northern\r\nhemisphere as far as the Tropic of Cancer. The result is that all the\r\ngreat equatorial currents of the ocean are impelled into the northern\r\nhemisphere, which thus, in consequence of the immense accumulation of\r\nwarm water, has its temperature raised, so that ice and snow must, to a\r\ngreat extent, disappear from the Arctic regions. In the prevalence of\r\nthe converse conditions the Arctic zone becomes clad in ice, and the\r\nsouthern has its temperature raised.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, according to Croll's calculations, the accumulation\r\nof ice on either pole would tend, by shifting the earth's centre of\r\ngravity, to raise the level of the ocean and submerge the land on the\r\ncolder hemisphere. Thus a submergence of land would coincide with a\r\ncold condition, and emergence with increasing warmth. Facts already\r\nreferred to, however, show that this has not always been the case, but\r\nthat in many cases submergence was accompanied with the influx of warm\r\nequatorial waters and a raised temperature, this apparently depending\r\non the question of local distribution of land and water; and this, in\r\nits turn, being regulated not always by mere shifting of the centre\r\nof gravity, but by foldings occasioned by contraction, by equatorial\r\nsubsidences resulting from the retardation of the earth's rotation, and\r\nby the excess of material abstracted by ice and frost from the Arctic\r\nregions, and drifted southward along the lines of arctic currents. This\r\ndrifting must in all geological times have greatly exceeded, as it\r\ncertainly does at present, the denudation caused by atmospheric action\r\nat the equator, and must have tended to increase the disposition to\r\nequatorial collapse occasioned by retardation of rotation.[178]\r\n\r\n[178] Croll, in \"Climate and Time,\" and in a note read before the\r\nBritish Association in 1876, takes an opposite view; but this is\r\nclearly contrary to the facts of sedimentation, which show a steady\r\nmovement of _débris_ toward the south and south-west.\r\n\r\nWhile such considerations as those above referred to tend to reduce\r\nthe practical importance of Mr. Croll's theory, on the other hand they\r\ntend to remove one of the greatest objections against it--namely,\r\nthat founded on the necessity of supposing that glacial periods recur\r\nwith astronomical regularity in geological time. They cannot do so if\r\ndependent on other causes inherent in the earth itself, and producing\r\nimportant movements of its crust.\r\n\r\nSir Robert Ball has in a recent work very ingeniously improved this\r\ntheory by showing that Croll was mistaken in assigning equal amounts\r\nof heat to the earth, as a whole, in the periods of greater and less\r\neccentricity. This would tend to augment the effect of astronomical\r\nrevolutions as causes of difference of temperature; but has no bearing\r\non the more serious geological objections to the theory in question.\r\n\r\nA fatal objection, however, to Croll's theory, the force of which has\r\nbeen greatly increased by recent discoveries, is that the astronomical\r\ncauses which he adduces would place the close of the last Glacial\r\nperiod at least 80,000 years ago, whereas it is now certainly known\r\nfrom geological facts that the close of the last Glacial period cannot\r\nbe older than about an eighth or a tenth of that time. This difficulty\r\nseems to have caused the greater number of geologists, specially\r\nacquainted with the later geological periods, to regard this theory as\r\nquite inapplicable to the facts.\r\n\r\nWe are thus obliged to fall back upon the old Lyellian theory of\r\ngeographical changes, with such modifications as recent discoveries\r\nhave rendered necessary. Taking this as our guide, we reach at once the\r\nimportant conclusion that the movements and distribution of animals\r\nand plants, however dependent on climate, altitude and depth, have,\r\nwhen regarded in connection with geological time, been primarily\r\ndetermined by those great movements of the crust of the earth which\r\nhave established our islands, continents and ocean depths. These\r\ngeographical changes have also in connection with animal and vegetable\r\ngrowth, deposition of sediments and volcanic ejections, fixed even the\r\nstations, soils and exposures of plants and animals. Thus, subject to\r\nthose great astronomical laws which regulate the temperature of our\r\nplanet as a whole, our attention may be restricted to the factors of\r\nphysical geography itself. We must, however, carry with us the idea\r\nthat though the great continents and the ocean depths may have been\r\nfixed throughout geological time, their relative elevations, and\r\nconsequently their limits, have varied to a great extent, and are\r\nconstantly changing.\r\n\r\nWe must also remember that something more than mere cold is necessary\r\nto produce a glacial period. It has sometimes been assumed that the\r\ntendency of an exceptionally cold winter would necessarily be to\r\naccumulate so great a quantity of snow and ice, that these could\r\nnot be removed in the short though warm summer, and so would go on\r\naccumulating from year to year. Actual experience and observation do\r\nnot confirm this supposition. In those parts of North America which\r\nhave a long and severe winter, the amount of snow deposited is not in\r\nproportion to the lowness of the temperature, but, on the contrary, the\r\ngreatest precipitation of snow takes place near the southern margin\r\nof a cold area, and the snow disappears with great rapidity when\r\nthe spring warmth sets in. Nor is there, as has been imagined, any\r\ntendency to the production of fogs and mists which have been invoked\r\nas agencies to shield the snow from the sun. In North America the\r\nmelting snow is ordinarily carried off as liquid water, or as invisible\r\nvapour, and the sky is usually clear when the snow is melting in\r\nspring. It is only when warm and moist winds are exceptionally thrown\r\nupon the snow-covered land that clouds are produced; and when this is\r\nthe case, the warm rain that ensues promotes the melting of the snow.\r\nThus there is no possibility of continued accumulations of snow on\r\nthe lower parts of our continents, under any imaginable conditions of\r\nclimate. It is only on elevated lands in high latitudes and near the\r\nocean, like Greenland and the Antarctic continent, that such permanent\r\nsnow-clad conditions can occur, except on mountain tops. Wallace and\r\nWœickoff[179] very properly maintain, in connection with these facts,\r\nthat permanent ice and snow cannot under any ordinary circumstances\r\nexist in low lands, and that high land and great precipitation are\r\nnecessary conditions of glaciers. The former, however, attaches rather\r\ntoo much importance to snow and ice as cooling agents; for though it is\r\ntrue that they absorb a large amount of heat in passing from the solid\r\nto the liquid state, yet the quantity of snow or ice to be melted in\r\nspring is so small in comparison with the vast and continuous pouring\r\nof solar heat on the surface, that a very short time suffices for the\r\nliquefaction of a deep covering of snow. The testimony of Siberian\r\ntravellers proves this, and the same fact is a matter of ordinary\r\nobservation in North America.\r\n\r\n[179] Von Wœickoff has very strongly put these principles in a Review\r\nof Croll's recent book, \"Climate and Cosmology\"; _American Journal of\r\nScience_, March, 1886.\r\n\r\nSetting aside, then, these assumptions, which proceed from incorrect or\r\ninsufficient information, we may now refer to a consideration of the\r\nutmost importance, and which Mr. Croll himself, though he adduces it\r\nonly in aid of the astronomical theory of glacial periods, has treated\r\nin so masterly a manner, as really to give it the first place as an\r\nefficient cause. This is the varying distribution of ocean currents,\r\nin connection with the differences in the elevation and distribution\r\nof land. The great equatorial current, produced by the action of the\r\nsolar heat on the atmosphere and the water, along with the earth's\r\nrotation, is thrown, by opposing continental shores, northward into\r\nthe Atlantic and Pacific in the Gulf Stream and Japan current, giving\r\nus a hot-water apparatus which effectually raises the temperature of\r\nthe whole northern hemisphere, and especially of the western sides of\r\nthe continents. Mr. Croll imagined that if his astronomical causes\r\ncould, to ever so small an extent, intensify the action of these\r\ncurrents, or their determination to the north, we should have a period\r\nof warmth, while a similar advantage given to the southern hemisphere\r\nwould produce a glacial age in the north. But this requires us to\r\nassume what ought to be proved; namely, that the position of aphelion,\r\nand the increase or decrease of eccentricity, would actually so swing\r\nthe equatorial current to the north or south. It further requires us\r\nto assume--and this is the most important defect of the theory--that\r\nno change occurs in the distribution of land and water; because\r\nany important change of this kind might obviously exert a dominant\r\ninfluence on the currents. Let us take two examples in illustration of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nAt the present time the warm water thrown into the North Atlantic,\r\nco-operating with the prevalent westerly winds, not only increases\r\nthe temperature of its whole waters, but gives an exceptionally mild\r\nclimate to western Europe. Still the countervailing influence of the\r\nArctic currents and the Greenland ice, is sufficient to permit numerous\r\nicebergs to remain unmelted on the coast of Labrador and Newfoundland\r\nthroughout the summer. Some of the bergs which creep down to the mouth\r\nof the Strait of Belle-Isle, in the latitude of the south of England,\r\nactually remain unmelted till the snows of a succeeding winter fall\r\nupon them. Now let us suppose that a subsidence of land in tropical\r\nAmerica were to allow the equatorial current to pass through into the\r\nPacific. The effect would at once be to reduce the temperature of\r\nNorway and Britain to that of Greenland and Labrador at present, while\r\nthe latter countries would themselves become colder. The northern\r\nice, drifting down into the Atlantic, would not, as now, be melted\r\nrapidly by the warm water which it meets in the Gulf Stream. Much\r\nlarger quantities of it would remain undissolved in summer, and thus\r\nan accumulation of permanent ice would take place, along the American\r\ncoast at first, but probably at length even on the European side.\r\nThis would still further chill the atmosphere, glaciers would be\r\nestablished on all the mountains of temperate Europe and America, the\r\nsummer would be kept cold by melting ice and snow, and at length all\r\neastern America and Europe might become uninhabitable, except by Arctic\r\nanimals and plants, as far south as perhaps 40° of north latitude. This\r\nwould be simply a return of the glacial age. I have assumed only one\r\ngeographical change; but other and more complex changes of subsidence\r\nand elevation might take place, with effects on climate still more\r\ndecisive.[180]\r\n\r\n[180] According to Bonney, the west coast of Wales is about 12° above\r\nthe average for its latitude, and if reduced to 12° below the average,\r\nits mountains would have large glaciers. So near is England even now to\r\na glacial age.\r\n\r\nWe may suppose an opposite case. The high plateau of Greenland might\r\nsubside, or be reduced in height, and the opening of Baffin's Bay might\r\nbe closed. At the same time the interior plain of America might be\r\ndepressed, so that, as we know to have been the case in the Cretaceous\r\nperiod, the warm waters of the Mexican gulf might circulate as far\r\nnorth as the basins of the present great American lakes. In these\r\ncircumstances there would be an immense diminution of the sources\r\nof floating ice, and a correspondingly vast increase in the surface\r\nof warm water. The effects would be to enable a temperate flora to\r\nsubsist in Greenland, and to bring all the present temperate regions of\r\nEurope and America into a condition of subtropical verdure.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to add that we actually know that changes\r\nnot dissimilar from those above sketched have really occurred in\r\ncomparatively recent geological times, to enable us to perceive that\r\nwe can dispense with all other causes of change of climate, though\r\nadmitting that some of them may have occupied a secondary place. This\r\nwill give us, in dealing with the distribution of life, the great\r\nadvantage of not being tied up to definite astronomical cycles of\r\nglaciation, which do not well agree with the geological facts, and\r\nof correlating elevation and subsidence of the land with changes of\r\nclimate affecting living beings. It will, however, be necessary, as\r\nWallace well insists, that we shall hold to a certain fixity of the\r\ncontinents in their position, notwithstanding the submergences and\r\nemergences which they have experienced.\r\n\r\nSir Charles Lyell, more than forty years ago, published in his\r\n\"Principles of Geology\" two imaginary maps, which illustrate the\r\nextreme effects of various distribution of land and water. In one, all\r\nthe continental masses are grouped around the equator. In the other\r\nthey are all placed around the poles, leaving an open equatorial ocean.\r\nIn the one case the whole of the land and its inhabitants would enjoy a\r\nperpetual summer, and scarcely any ice could exist in the sea. In the\r\nother, the whole of the land would be subjected to an Arctic climate,\r\nand it would give off immense quantities of ice to cool the ocean. Sir\r\nCharles remarks on the present apparently capricious distribution of\r\nland and water, the greater part being in the northern hemisphere, and,\r\nin this, placed in a very unequal manner. But Lyell did not suppose\r\nthat any such distribution as that represented in his maps had actually\r\noccurred, though this supposition has been sometimes attributed to him.\r\nHe merely put what he regarded as an extreme case to illustrate what\r\nmight occur under conditions less exaggerated. Sir Charles, like all\r\nother thoughtful geologists, was well aware of the general fixity of\r\nthe areas of the continents, though with great modifications in the\r\nmatter of submergences and of land conditions. The union, indeed, of\r\nthese two great principles of fixity and diversity of the continents\r\nlies at the foundation of theoretical geology.\r\n\r\nWe can now more precisely indicate this than was possible when Lyell\r\nproduced his \"Principles,\" and can reproduce the conditions of our\r\ncontinents in even the more ancient periods of their history. An\r\nexample of this may be given from the American continent, which is\r\nmore simple in its arrangements than the double continent of Eurasia.\r\nTake, for instance, the early Devonian or Erian period, in which the\r\nmagnificent flora of that age, the earliest certainly known to us,\r\nmade its appearance. Imagine the whole interior plain of North America\r\nsubmerged, so that the continent is reduced to two strips on the\r\neast and west, connected by a belt of Laurentian land on the north.\r\nIn the great mediterranean sea thus produced, the tepid water of the\r\nequatorial current was circulated, and it swarmed with corals, of\r\nwhich we know no less than 150 species, and with other forms of life\r\nappropriate to warm seas. On the islands and coasts of this sea was\r\nintroduced the Erian flora, appearing first in the north, and with that\r\nvitality and colonizing power of which, as Hooker has well shown, the\r\nScandinavian flora is the best modern type, spreading itself to the\r\nsouth. A very similar distribution of land and water in the Cretaceous\r\nage gave a warm and equable climate in those portions of North America\r\nnot submerged, and coincided with the appearance of the multitude\r\nof broad-leaved trees of modern types which appeared in the middle\r\nCretaceous, and prepared the way for the mammalian life of the Eocene.\r\n\r\nWe have in America ancient periods of cold as well as of warmth. I\r\nhave elsewhere referred to the boulder conglomerates of the Huronian,\r\nof the early Lower Silurian, and of the Millstone grit period of the\r\nCarboniferous; but I have not ventured to affirm that either of these\r\nperiods was comparable in its cold with the later glacial age, still\r\nless with that imaginary age of continental glaciation, assumed by\r\nthe more extreme theorists. We know that these ancient conglomerates\r\nwere produced by floating ice, and this at periods when in areas not\r\nvery remote, temperate floras and faunas could flourish. The glacial\r\nperiods of our old continent occurred in times when the surface of the\r\nsubmerged land was opened up to the northern currents drifting over it\r\nmud and sand and stones, and rendering nugatory, in so far, at least,\r\nas the bottom of the sea was concerned, the effects of the superficial\r\nwarm streams. Some of these beds are also peculiar to the eastern\r\nmargin of the continent, and indicate ice drift along the Atlantic\r\ncoast much as at present, while conditions of greater warmth existed in\r\nthe interior. Even in the more recent glacial age, while the mountains\r\nwere covered with snow, and the low lands submerged under a sea laden\r\nwith ice, there were interior tracts in somewhat high latitudes of\r\nAmerica in which hardy forest trees and herbaceous plants flourished\r\nabundantly, and these were by no means exceptional \"interglacial\"\r\nperiods. Thus we can prove that from the remote Huronian period to the\r\nTertiary, the American land occupied the same position as at present,\r\nand that its changes were merely changes of relative level, as compared\r\nwith the sea; but which so influenced the ocean currents as to cause\r\ngreat vicissitudes of climate.\r\n\r\nUniformitarian geologists have recently been taunted with a willingness\r\nto assume great and frequent elevations and submergences of\r\ncontinents, as if this were contrary to their principle. But rational\r\nuniformitarianism allows us to use any cause of whose operation in the\r\npast there is good geological evidence, and Lyell himself was perfectly\r\naware of this.\r\n\r\nWhile no geologists can fail to appreciate the evidence of the power\r\nof geographical change in affecting climatal change, and the fact that\r\nsuch change has occurred at various geological periods, there are some,\r\nand especially those who take extreme views as to the latest period\r\nof cold climate, who doubt its sufficiency to account for all the\r\nphenomena observed. It is instructive, however, to notice that some of\r\nthe ablest of these, in default of other probable causes, are driven to\r\nfall back either on agencies of a wholly improbable character, or to\r\ngive up the problem as insoluble. Two recent examples of this deserve\r\ncitation.\r\n\r\nThe late Dr. Newmayr, of Vienna, a veteran physical geographer, in\r\nan able discussion of the climates of past ages, one of his last\r\nscientific papers, has fallen back on the hypothesis of a change in\r\nthe position of the poles.[181] His failure to account for ancient\r\nclimates by other causes evidently, however, depends on an inadequate\r\nconception of the effects of geographical changes, along with serious\r\nmisconceptions as to the distribution of plants and the characters of\r\nvegetation at different periods. These points we shall have to discuss\r\nin subsequent pages.\r\n\r\n[181] _Society for Dissemination of Natural Science._ Vienna, January,\r\n1889.\r\n\r\nIn an address before the American Association, in 1886, Dr.\r\nChamberlain, one of the ablest American authorities on the Glacial\r\nperiod, makes the following remarks as to the causes of the Pleistocene\r\ncold:--\r\n\r\n\"If we turn to the broader speculations respecting the origin of the\r\nGlacial epoch, we find our wealth little increased. We have on hand\r\npractically the same old stock of hypotheses, all badly damaged by\r\nthe deluge of recent facts. The earlier theory of northern elevation\r\nhas been rendered practically valueless; and the various astronomical\r\nhypotheses seem to be the worse for the increased knowledge of the\r\ndistribution of the ancient ice sheet. Even the ingenious theory\r\nof Croll becomes increasingly unsatisfactory as the phenomena are\r\ndeveloped into fuller appreciation. The more we consider the asymmetry\r\nof the ice distribution in latitude and longitude, and its disparity\r\nin elevation, the more difficult it becomes to explain the phenomena\r\nupon any astronomical basis. If we were at liberty to disregard the\r\nconsiderations forced upon us by physicists and astronomers, and\r\npermit ourselves simply to follow freely the apparent leadings of the\r\nphenomena, it appears at this hour as though we should be led upon an\r\nold and forbidden trail,--the hypothesis of a wandering pole. It is\r\nadmitted that there is a _vera causa_ in elevations and depressions of\r\nthe earth's crust, but it is held inadequate. It is admitted that the\r\napparent changes of latitude shown by the determinations of European\r\nand American observatories are remarkable, but their trustworthiness\r\nis challenged. Were there no barriers against free hypotheses in\r\nthis direction, glacial phenomena could apparently find adequate\r\nexplanation; but debarred--as we doubtless should consider ourselves to\r\nbe at present--from this resource, our hypotheses remain inharmonious\r\nwith the facts, and the riddle remains unsolved.\"\r\n\r\nIt should be observed here that the unsolved \"riddle\" is that of a\r\ncontinental ice sheet. This, as we have already seen, is probably\r\ninsoluble in any way, but fortunately needs no solution, being merely\r\nimaginary. If we adopt a moderate view as to the actual conditions of\r\nthe Pleistocene, the geographical theory will be found quite sufficient\r\nto account for the facts.\r\n\r\nLet it be observed here also, in connection with the above thoughtful\r\nand frank avowal of one of the ablest of American glacialists, that\r\nthe geographical theory provides for that \"asymmetry \"'or irregular\r\ndistribution of glacial deposits to which he refers; since, at every\r\nstage of continental elevation and depression, there must have been\r\nlocal changes of circumstances; and the same inequality of temperature\r\nin identical latitudes which we observe at present must have existed,\r\nprobably in a greater degree, in the Glacial age.\r\n\r\nThe sufficiency of the Lyellian theory to account for the facts, in so\r\nfar as plants are concerned, may, indeed, be inferred from the course\r\nof the isothermal lines at present. The south end of Greenland is on\r\nthe latitude of Christiania, in Norway, on the one hand, and of Fort\r\nLiard, in the Peace River region, on the other; and while Greenland\r\nis clad in ice and snow, wheat and other grains, and the ordinary\r\ntrees of temperate climates, grow at the latter places. It is evident,\r\ntherefore, that only exceptionally unfavourable circumstances prevent\r\nthe Greenland area from still possessing a temperate flora, and these\r\nunfavourable circumstances possibly tell even on the localities with\r\nwhich we have compared it. Further, the mouth of the McKenzie River\r\nis in the same latitude with Disco, near which are some of the most\r\ncelebrated localities of fossil Cretaceous and Tertiary plants. Yet\r\nthe mouth of the McKenzie River enjoys a much more favourable climate,\r\nand has a much more abundant flora than Disco. If North Greenland were\r\nsubmerged, and low land reaching to the south terminated at Disco,\r\nand if from any cause either the cold currents of Baffin's Bay were\r\narrested, or additional warm water thrown into the North Atlantic by\r\nthe Gulf Stream, there is nothing to prevent a mean temperature of 45°\r\nFahrenheit from prevailing at Disco; and the estimate ordinarily formed\r\nof the requirements of its extinct floras is 50°, which is probably\r\nabove, rather than below, the actual temperature required.\r\n\r\nWe thus know that the present distribution of land and water greatly\r\ninfluences climate, more especially by affecting that of the ocean\r\ncurrents and of the winds, and by the different action of land as\r\ncompared with water in the reception and radiation of heat. The\r\npresent distribution of land gives a large predominance to the Arctic\r\nand sub-Arctic regions, as compared with the equatorial and with\r\nthe Antarctic; and we might readily imagine other distributions that\r\nwould give very different results. But this is not an imaginary\r\ncase, for we can to some extent restore, on geological grounds, the\r\nancient geography of large regions, and can show that it has been\r\nvery different from that prevailing at present. We know also that,\r\nwhile the forms and positions of the great continents have been fixed\r\nfrom a very early date, they have experienced many great submergences\r\nand re-elevations, and that these have occurred in somewhat regular\r\nsequence, as evidenced by the cyclical alternations of organic\r\nlimestones and earthy sediments in the successive great geological\r\nperiods, each of which, as may be seen in any geological text-book,\r\npresents a dip of the continental plateaus, with subsequent elevation,\r\nas if the land was subject to a series of regular pulsations.[182]\r\n\r\n[182] See \"Acadian Geology\"--Introduction to the Carboniferous System.\r\n\r\nFinally, the Lyellian theory tends to abate the tendency to imagine\r\nportentous and impossible climatal changes; and it inclines geologists\r\nto give more attention to the connection of palæogeography with changes\r\nin the life history of the earth.\r\n\r\n  References:--\"Acadian Geology,\" 1st ed., 1855; 4th ed., 1892.\r\n    Icebergs of Belle-Isle, and Glaciers of Mont Blanc, _Canadian\r\n    Naturalist_, 1865. \"Notes on Pleistocene of Canada,\" Montreal,\r\n    1871.

We must have reference to those changes of climate and of\r\nelevation which have occurred in the more recent periods of the earth's\r\nhistory, and must carry with us the idea, at first not apparently very\r\nreasonable, that living beings have existed much longer than many of\r\nthe lands which they inhabit, or at least than the present state of\r\nthose lands in reference to isolation or continental connection. To\r\nwhat extent we may further require to call in the aid of varietal or\r\nspecific modification to explain the facts, may be more doubtful; and I\r\nthink we shall find that a larger acquaintance with geological truths\r\nwould enable us to dispense with the aid of hypotheses of evolution, at\r\nleast in so far as the local establishment of new generic and specific\r\ntypes is concerned.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable and startling results of geological\r\ninvestigation, and one which must be accepted as an established fact,\r\nindependently of all theoretical explanations, is that the earth has\r\nexperienced enormous revolutions of climate within comparatively\r\nlate periods, and since the date of the introduction of many existing\r\nspecies of animals and plants. To this great truth, in some of its\r\nbearings, I have endeavoured to direct attention in the previous\r\narticles. In the present case it will be necessary to consider these\r\nvicissitudes in their more general aspects, and with some reference to\r\ntheir effects on the distribution of living beings.\r\n\r\nThe modern or human period of geology, that in which man and his\r\ncontemporaries are certainly known to have inhabited the earth, was\r\nimmediately preceded by an age of climatal refrigeration known as\r\nthe Glacial or Ice age. This was further characterized not only by\r\na prevalence of cold, unexampled so far as known either before or\r\nsince, but by immense changes of the relative levels of sea and land,\r\namounting, in some cases, at least, to several thousands of feet. The\r\noccurrence of these changes is clearly proved by the undoubted traces\r\nof the action of ice, whether land ice or floating ice, on all parts\r\nof our continents, half way to the equator, and by the occurrence of\r\nsea terraces and modern marine shells at high levels on mountains and\r\ntable-lands. Perhaps we scarcely realize as we should the stupendous\r\ncharacter of the changes involved in the driftage of heavy ice over\r\nour continents as far south as the latitude of 40°, in the deposit\r\nof boulders on hills several thousands of feet in height, and in the\r\noccurrence of shells of species still living in the sea, in beds raised\r\nto more than twelve hundred feet above its present level. Yet such\r\nchanges must have occurred in the latest geological period immediately\r\npreceding that in which we live. Proceeding farther back in geological\r\ntime, we find the still more extraordinary fact that in the middle and\r\nearlier Tertiary the northern hemisphere enjoyed a climate so much more\r\nmild than that which now prevails, that plants at present confined to\r\ntemperate latitudes could flourish in Greenland and Spitzbergen.[183]\r\nThe age in which we live is thus one of mediocrity, attaining neither\r\nto the Arctic rigour of the later Pleistocene, nor to the universal\r\nmildness of the preceding Miocene.\r\n\r\n[183] As I have elsewhere shown, a warm climate in an Arctic region\r\nseems to have afforded the necessary conditions for the great\r\ncolonizing floras of all geological periods.\r\n\r\nThe causes of these changes of climate we have discussed elsewhere.\r\nIt remains for us now to consider the actual condition of our present\r\ncontinents, and the bearing of past conditions on the distribution of\r\ntheir living inhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of continents and islands, it may be as well to remark at\r\nthe outset that all the land existing, or which probably has at any\r\ntime existed, consists of islands great or small. It is all surrounded\r\nby the ocean. Two of the greater masses of land are, however,\r\nsufficiently extensive to be regarded as continents, and from their\r\nvery extent and consequent permanence may be considered as the more\r\nspecial homes of the living beings of the land. Two other portions of\r\nland, Australia and the Antarctic polar continent, may be regarded\r\neither as smaller continents or large islands, but partake of insular\r\nrather than continental characters in their animals and plants. All the\r\nother portions of land are properly islands; but while these islands,\r\nand more especially those in mid-ocean, cannot be regarded as the\r\noriginal homes of many forms of life, we shall find that they have a\r\nspecial interest as the shelters and refuges of numerous very ancient\r\nand now decaying species.\r\n\r\nThe two great continents of America and Eurasia have been the most\r\npermanent portions of the land throughout geological time, some parts\r\nof them having always been above water, probably from the Laurentian\r\nage downward, though at various times they have been reduced to little\r\nmore than groups of islands. On them, and more especially in their\r\nmore northern parts, in which the long continuance of daylight in\r\nsummer seems in warm periods to have been peculiarly favourable to the\r\nintroduction of new vegetable and animal forms, and to the giving to\r\nthem that vigour necessary for active colonization, have originated the\r\ngreater number of the inhabitants of the land.\r\n\r\nRegarded as portions of the earth's crust, the continents are areas\r\nin which the lateral thrust, caused by the secular contraction of the\r\ninterior of the earth and unequal settlement of the crust, has ridged\r\nup and folded the rocks, producing mountain chains. This process began\r\nin the earliest geological periods, and has been repeated at long\r\nintervals, the original lines of folding guiding those formed in each\r\nnew thrust proceeding from the broad oceanic areas. Along the ridges\r\nthus produced, and in the narrower spaces between them, the greater\r\npart of the sediment carried by water was laid down, thus producing\r\nplateaus in connection with the mountain-chains, while the weight of\r\nnew sediments and the removal of matter from other areas by denudation,\r\nhave been constantly producing local depression and elevation. The\r\ntendency of the ocean to be thrown toward the poles by the retardation\r\nof the earth's rotation, alternating with great collapses of the\r\ncrust at the equator proceeding from the same cause, along with the\r\nsecular cooling, have produced alternate submergence and emergence\r\nof these plateaus. This has been further complicated by the constant\r\ntendency of the Arctic and Antarctic currents, aided by ice, to drift\r\nsolid materials, set free by the vast denuding action of frost, from\r\nthe polar to the temperate regions, and by the further tendency of\r\nanimal life to heap up calcareous accumulations under the warm waters\r\nof the tropical regions. All these changes, as already stated, have\r\nconspired to modify the directions of the great oceanic currents, and\r\nto produce vicissitudes of climate under which animals and plants have\r\nbeen subjected in geological time to those migrations, extinctions,\r\nand renovations of which their fossil remains and present distribution\r\nafford evidence.\r\n\r\nStill, it is true that throughout the whole of these great mutations,\r\nsince the beginning of geological history, there seems never to have\r\nbeen any time when the ocean so regained its dominion as to produce a\r\ntotal extinction of land life; still less was there any time when the\r\nnecessary conditions of all the various forms of marine life failed to\r\nbe found; nor was there any climatal change so extreme as to banish any\r\nof the leading forms of life from the earth. To geologists it is not\r\nnecessary to say that the conclusions sketched above are those that\r\nhave been reached as the results of long and laborious investigation,\r\nand which have been illustrated and established by Lyell, Dana,\r\nWallace,[184] and many other writers.[185] Let us now place beside them\r\nsome facts as to the present distribution of life, and of the agencies\r\nwhich influence it.\r\n\r\n[184] Wallace, \"Geographical Distribution of Animals\" and \"Island\r\nLife.\" Second edition.\r\n\r\n[185] The writer has endeavoured to popularize these great results of\r\ngeology in his work, the \"Story of the Earth.\" Ninth Edition. London,\r\n1887. They are often overlooked by specialists, and by compilers of\r\ngeological manuals.\r\n\r\nJust as political geography sometimes presents boundaries not\r\nin accordance with the physical structure of countries, so the\r\ndistribution of animals and plants shows many peculiar and unexpected\r\nfeatures. Hence naturalists have divided the continents into what\r\nSclater has called zoological regions, which are, so to speak, the\r\ngreat empires of animal life, divisible often by less prominent\r\nboundaries into provinces. In vegetable life similar boundaries may\r\nbe drawn, more or less coincident with the zoological divisions.\r\nZoologically, North America and Greenland may be regarded as one\r\ngreat region, the Nearctic, or new Arctic, the prefix not indicating\r\nthat the animals are newer than those of the old world, which is by\r\nno means the case. South America constitutes another region the\r\nNeotropical. If now we turn to the greater Eurasian continent, with\r\nits two prolongations to the south in Africa and Australia, we shall\r\nfind the whole northern portion, from the Atlantic to the Pacific,\r\nconstituting one vast region of animal life, the Palearctic, which also\r\nincludes Iceland and a strip across North Africa. Africa itself, with\r\nMadagascar, whose allegiance is, however, only partial, constitutes\r\nthe Ethiopian region. India, Burmah, the south of China, and certain\r\nAsiatic islands form the Oriental region. Australia, New Guinea, and\r\nthe Polynesian islands constitute the Australian region. All of these\r\nregions may in a geological point of view be considered as portions of\r\nold and permanent continental masses, which, though with movements of\r\nelevation and depression, have continued to exist for vast periods.\r\nSome of them, however, seem to have enjoyed greater immunity from\r\ncauses of change than others, and present, accordingly, animals and\r\nplants having, geologically speaking, an antique aspect in comparison.\r\nIn this sense the Australian province may be regarded as the oldest of\r\nall in the facies of its animal forms, since creatures exist there of\r\ngenera and families which have very long ago become extinct everywhere\r\nelse. Next in age to this should rank the Neotropical or South American\r\nregion, which, like Australia, presents many low and archaic forms\r\nof animal life. The Ethiopian region stands next to it in this, the\r\nOriental and Nearctic next, and last and most modern in its aspect is\r\nthe great Palearctic region, to which man himself belongs, and the\r\nanimals and plants of which vindicate their claims to youth by that\r\naggressive and colonizing character already referred to, and which has\r\nenabled them to spread themselves widely over the other regions, even\r\nindependently of the influence of man. On the other hand, the animals\r\nand plants of the Australian and South American regions show no such\r\ncolonizing tendency, and can scarcely maintain themselves against those\r\nof other regions when introduced among them. Thus we have at once\r\nin these continental regions a great and suggestive example of the\r\nconnection of geographical and geological distribution, the details of\r\nwhich are of the deepest interest, and have not yet been fully worked\r\nout. One great principle is, however, sufficiently established; namely,\r\nthat the northern regions have been the birthplace of new forms of\r\nland life, whence they have extended themselves to the south, while\r\nthe comparative isolation and equable climate of the South American\r\nand Australian regions have enabled them to shelter and retain the old\r\nmoribund tribes.\r\n\r\nThose smaller portions of land separated from the continental masses,\r\nthe islands properly so called, present, as might be expected, many\r\npeculiar features. Wallace divides them into two classes, though he\r\nadmits that these pass into each other. Continental islands are those\r\nin the vicinity of continents. They consist of ancient as well as\r\nmodern rock formations, and contain animals which indicate a former\r\ncontinental connection. Some of these are separated from the nearest\r\nmainland only by shallow seas or straits, and may be assumed to have\r\nbecome islands only in recent geological times. Others are divided from\r\nthe nearest continent by very deep-water, so that they have probably\r\nbeen longer severed from the mainland. These contain more peculiar\r\nassemblages of animals and plants than the islands of the former class.\r\nOceanic islands are more remote from the continents. They consist\r\nmostly of rocks belonging to the modern geological periods, and contain\r\nno animals of those classes which can migrate only by land. Such\r\nislands may be assumed never to have been connected with any continent.\r\nThe study of the indigenous population of these various classes of\r\nislands affords many curious and interesting results, which Wallace\r\nhas collected with vast industry and care, and which, on the whole,\r\nhe explains in a judicious manner and in accordance with the facts of\r\ngeology. When, however, he maintains that evolution of the Darwinian\r\ntype is \"the key to distribution,\" he departs widely from any basis of\r\nscientific fact. This becomes apparent when we consider the following\r\nresults, which appear everywhere in the discussion of the various\r\ninsular faunas and floras:--(1) None of these islands, however remote,\r\ncan be affirmed to have been peopled by the spontaneous evolution of\r\nthe higher animals or plants from lower forms. Their population is in\r\nevery case not autochthonous, but derived. (2) Even in those which are\r\nmost distant from the continents, and may be supposed to have been\r\ncolonized in very ancient times, there is no evidence of any very\r\nimportant modification of their inhabitants. (3) While the facts point\r\nto the origin of most forms of terrestrial life in the Palearctic and\r\nNearctic regions, they afford no information as to the manner or cause\r\nof their origination. In short, so far is evolution from being a key\r\nto distribution, that the whole question would become much more simple\r\nif this element were omitted altogether. A few examples may be useful\r\nto illustrate this, as well as the actual explanation of the phenomena\r\nafforded by legitimate science.\r\n\r\nThe Azores are situated in a warm temperate latitude about 900 miles\r\nwest of Portugal, and separated from it by a sea 2,500 fathoms in\r\ndepth. The islands themselves are almost wholly volcanic, and the\r\noldest rocks known in them are of late Miocene age. There is no\r\nprobability that these islands have ever been connected with Europe\r\nor Africa, nor is there at present any certainty that they have been\r\njoined to one another, or have formed part of any larger insular\r\ntract. In these islands there is only one indigenous mammal, a bat,\r\nwhich is identical with a European species, and no doubt reached the\r\nislands by flight. There is no indigenous reptile, amphibian, or\r\nfresh-water fish. Of birds there are, exclusive of waterfowl, which\r\nmay be regarded as visitors, twenty-two land birds; but of these, four\r\nare regarded as merely accidental stragglers, so that only eighteen\r\nare permanent residents. Of these birds fifteen are common European or\r\nAfrican species, which must have flown to the islands, or have been\r\ndrifted thither in storms. Of the remaining three, two are found also\r\nin Madeira and the Canaries, and therefore may reasonably be supposed\r\nto have been derived from Africa. One only is regarded as peculiar\r\nto the Azores, and this is a bullfinch, so nearly related to the\r\nEuropean bullfinch that it may be regarded as merely a local variety.\r\nWallace accounts for these facts by supposing that the Azores were\r\ndepopulated by the cold of the Glacial age, and that all these birds\r\nhave arrived since that time. There is, however, little probability in\r\nsuch a supposition. He further supposes that fresh supplies of stray\r\nbirds from the mainland, arriving from time to time, have kept up\r\nthe identity of the species. Instead of evolution assisting him, he\r\nhas thus somewhat to strain the facts to agree with that hypothesis.\r\nSimilar explanations are given for the still more remarkable fact that\r\nthe land plants of the Azores are almost wholly identical with European\r\nand African forms. The insects and the land snails are, however, held\r\nto indicate the evolution of a certain number of new specific forms on\r\nthe islands. The beetles number no less than 212 species, though nearly\r\nhalf of them are supposed to have been introduced by man. Of the whole\r\nnumber 175 are European, 19 are found in Madeira and the Canaries, 3\r\nare American. Fourteen remain to be accounted for, though most of these\r\nare closely allied to European and other species; but a few are quite\r\ndistinct from any elsewhere known. Wallace, however, very truly remarks\r\nthat our knowledge of the continental beetles is not complete; that the\r\nspecies in question are small and obscure; that they may be survivors\r\nof the Glacial period, and may thus represent species now extinct on\r\nthe mainland; and that for these reasons it may not be irrational to\r\nsuppose that these peculiar insects either still inhabit, or did once\r\ninhabit, some part of the continents, and may be portions of \"ancient\r\nand widespread groups,\" once widely diffused, but now restricted to\r\na few insular spots. Among the land snails, if anywhere, we should\r\nfind evidence either of autochthonous evolution or of specific change.\r\nThese animals have existed on the earth since the Carboniferous period,\r\nand, notwithstanding their proverbial slowness and sedentary habits,\r\nthey have contrived to colonize every habitable spot of land on the\r\nglobe--that is, unless in some of these places they have originated _de\r\nnovo_. In the Azores there are sixty-nine species of land snails, of\r\nwhich no less than thirty-two, or nearly one-half, are peculiar, though\r\nnearly all are closely allied to European types. What, then, is the\r\norigin of these thirty-two species, admitting for the sake of argument\r\nthat they are really distinct, and not merely varietal forms, though it\r\nis well known that in this group species are often unduly multiplied.\r\nThree suppositions are possible, (1) These snails may have originated\r\nin the islands themselves, either by creation or evolution from lower\r\nforms; say, from sea snails. (2) They may have been modified from\r\nmodern continental species. (3) They may be unmodified descendants of\r\nspecies of Miocene or Pliocene age now existing on the continents only\r\nas fossils. As the islands appear to have existed since Miocene times,\r\nit is no more improbable that species of that or the Pliocene age\r\nshould have found their way to them than that modern species should;\r\nand as we know only a fraction of the Tertiary species of Europe or\r\nAfrica, it is not likely that we shall be able to identify all of these\r\nearly visitors. Unfortunately no Miocene or Pliocene deposits holding\r\nremains of land snails are known in the Azores themselves, so that\r\nthis kind of evidence fails us. In Madeira and Porto Santo, however,\r\nwhere there are numerous modern snails, there are Pliocene beds holding\r\nremains of these animals. In Madeira there are, according to Lyell, 36\r\nPliocene species, and in Porto Santo 35, and of these only eight are\r\nextinct. Thus we can prove that many of the peculiar species of these\r\nislands have remained unchanged since Pliocene times. While differing\r\nfrom modern European shells, several of these species are very near to\r\nEuropean Miocene species. Thus we seem to have evidence in the Madeira\r\ngroup, not of modification, but of unchanged survival of Tertiary\r\nspecies long since extinct in Europe. May we not infer that the same\r\nwas the case in the Azores? These results are certainly very striking\r\nwhen we consider how long the Azores must have existed as islands, how\r\nvery rarely animals, and especially pairs of animals, must have reached\r\nthem, and how complete has been the isolation of these animals, and\r\nhow peculiar the conditions to which they have been subjected in their\r\nisland retreat.\r\n\r\nOther oceanic islands present great varieties of conditions, but\r\nleading to similar conclusions. Some, as the Bermudas, seem to have\r\nbeen settled in very modern times with animals and plants nearly all\r\nidentical with those of neighbouring countries, though even here\r\nit would appear that there are some indigenous species which would\r\nindicate a greater age or more extended lands, now submerged.[186]\r\nOthers, like St. Helena, are occupied apparently with old settlers,\r\nwhich may have come to them in early Tertiary, or even in Secondary\r\nperiods, which have long since become extinct on the continents, and\r\nwhose nearest analogues are now widely scattered over the world.\r\nIslands are therefore places of survival of old species--special\r\npreserves for forms of life lost to the continents. One of the most\r\ncurious of these is Celebes, which seems to be a surviving fragment\r\nof Miocene Asia, which, though so near to that continent, has been\r\nsufficiently isolated to preserve its old population during all\r\nthe vast lapse of time between the middle Tertiary and the present\r\nperiod. This is a fact which gives to the oceanic islands the greatest\r\ngeological interest, and induces us to look into their actual fauna and\r\nflora for the representatives of species known on the mainland only as\r\nfossils. It is thus that we look to the marsupials of Australia as the\r\nnearest analogues of those of the Jurassic of Europe, and that we find\r\nin the strange Barramunda (_ceratodus_) of its rivers the only survivor\r\nof a group of fishes once widely distributed, but which has long since\r\nperished elsewhere.\r\n\r\n[186] Heilprin mentions eleven marine mollusks supposed to be peculiar\r\nto the islands, and eight species of land shells, as well as a few\r\nCrustaceans hitherto found only in the Pacific. The comparisons are,\r\nhowever, admitted to be incomplete.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most interesting examples of this is furnished by\r\nthe Galapagos Islands, an example the more remarkable that no one who\r\nhas read in Darwin's fascinating \"Journal\" the description of these\r\nislands, can have failed to perceive that the peculiarities of this\r\nstrange Archipelago must have been prominent among the facts which\r\nfirst planted in his mind the germ of that theory of the origin of\r\nspecies which has since grown to such gigantic dimensions. It is\r\ncurious also to reflect that had the bearing of geological history on\r\nthe facts of distribution been as well known forty years ago as it is\r\nnow, the reasoning of the great naturalist on this and similar cases\r\nmight have taken an entirely different direction.\r\n\r\nThe Galapagos are placed exactly on the equator, and therefore out\r\nof reach of even the suspicion of having been visited by the glacial\r\ncold, though from their isolation in the ocean, and the effects of\r\nthe currents flowing along the American coast, their climate is not\r\nextremely hot. They are 600 miles west of South America, and the\r\nseparating ocean is in some parts 3,000 fathoms deep. The largest of\r\nthe islands is 75 miles in length, and some of the hills attain an\r\nelevation of about 4,000 feet, so that there are considerable varieties\r\nof station and climate. So far as is known they are wholly volcanic,\r\nand they may be regarded as the summits of submerged mountains not\r\nunlike in structure to the Andes of the mainland. Their exact\r\ngeological age is unknown, but there is no improbability in supposing\r\nthat they may have existed with more or less of extension since the\r\nSecondary or Mesozoic period. In any case their fauna is in some\r\nrespects a survival of that age. Lyell has truly remarked, \"In the\r\nfauna of the Galapagos Islands we have a state of things very analogous\r\nto that of the Secondary period.\"\r\n\r\nLike other oceanic islands, the Galapagos have no indigenous mammals,\r\nwith the doubtful exception of a South American mouse; but, unlike\r\nmost others, they are rich in reptiles. At the head of these stand\r\nseveral species of gigantic tortoises. This group of animals, so far\r\nas known, commenced its existence in the Eocene Tertiary; and in this\r\nand the Miocene period still more gigantic species existed on the\r\ncontinents. It has been supposed that at some such early date they\r\nreached the Galapagos from South America. Another group of Galapagan\r\nreptiles, perhaps still more remarkable, is that of iguana-like lizards\r\nof the genus _Amblyrhyncus_, which are vegetable feeders,--one of them\r\nbrowsing on marine weeds. They recall the great iguana-like reptiles\r\nof the European Wealden, and stand remote from all modern types. There\r\nare also snakes of two species, but these are South American forms,\r\nand may have drifted to the islands in comparatively recent times on\r\nfloating trees. The birds are a curious assemblage. A few are common\r\nAmerican species, like the rice bird. Others are quaint and peculiar\r\ncreatures, allied to South American birds, but probably representing\r\nforms long since extinct on the continent. The bird fauna, as Wallace\r\nremarks, indicates that some of these animals are old residents, others\r\nmore recent arrivals; and it is probable that they have arrived at\r\nvarious times since the early Tertiary. He assumes that the earlier\r\narrivals have been modified in the islands \"into a variety of distinct\r\ntypes\"; but the only evidence of this is that some of the species are\r\nclosely related to each other. It is more likely that they represent\r\nto our modern eyes the unmodified descendants of continental birds of\r\nthe early Tertiary. Darwin remarks that they are remarkably sombre\r\nin colouring for equatorial birds; but perhaps their ancestors came\r\nfrom a cooler climate, and have not been able to don a tropical garb;\r\nor perhaps they belong to a far-back age, when the vegetable kingdom\r\nalso was less rich in colouring than it is at present, and the birds\r\nwere in harmony with it. This, indeed, seems still to be the character\r\nof the Galapagos plants, which Darwin says have \"a wretched, weedy\r\nappearance,\" without gay flowers, though later visitors have expressed\r\na more favourable opinion.\r\n\r\nThese plants are in themselves very remarkable, for they are largely\r\npeculiar species, and are in many cases confined to particular islands,\r\nhaving apparently been unable to cross from one island to another,\r\nthough in some way able to reach the group. The explanation is that\r\nthey resemble North American plants, and came to the Galapagos at a\r\ntime when a wide strait separated North and South America, allowing\r\nthe equatorial current to pass through, and drift plants to the\r\nGalapagos, where they have been imprisoned ever since. This was\r\nprobably in Miocene times, and when we know more of the Miocene flora\r\nof the southern part of North America we may hope to recover some of\r\nthe ancestors of the Galapagos plants. In the meantime their probable\r\norigin and antiquity, as stated by Wallace, render unnecessary any\r\nhypothesis of modification.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject, it is proper to observe that on the\r\ncontinents themselves there are many remarkable cases of isolation of\r\nspecies, which help us better to understand the conditions of insular\r\nareas. The \"variable hare\" of the Scottish highlands, and of the\r\nextreme north of Europe, appears again in the Alps, the Pyrenees, and\r\nthe Caucasus, being in these mountains separated by a thousand miles\r\nof apparently impassable country from its northern haunts. It no doubt\r\nextended itself over the intervening plains at a time when Europe was\r\ncolder than at present. Another curious case is that of the marsh-tit\r\nof Europe. This little bird is found throughout south-western Europe.\r\nIt reappears in China, but is not known anywhere between. In Siberia\r\nand northern Europe there is, however, a species or distinct race which\r\nconnects these isolated patches. In this case, if the Siberian species\r\nis truly distinct, we have a remarkable case of isolation and of the\r\npermanence of identical characters for a long time; for in that case\r\nthis bird must be a survivor of the Pliocene or Miocene time. On the\r\nother hand, if, as is perhaps more likely, the marsh-tit is only a\r\nlocal variety of the Siberian species, we have an illustration of the\r\nlocal recurrence of this form when the conditions are favourable, even\r\nthough separated by a great space and long time.\r\n\r\nThe study of fossils gives us the true meaning of such facts, and\r\ncauses us to cease to wonder at any case of local repetition of\r\nspecies, however widely separated. The \"big trees\" of California\r\nconstitute a remarkable example. There are at present two very distinct\r\nspecies of these trees, both found only in limited areas of the western\r\npart of North America. Fossil trees of the same genus (_Sequoia_)\r\noccur as far back as the Cretaceous age; but in this age ten or more\r\nspecies are known. Nor are they confined to America, but occur in\r\nvarious parts of the Eurasian continent as well. Two of the Lower\r\nCretaceous species are so near to the two modern ones that even an\r\nunbeliever in evolution may suppose them to be possible ancestors; the\r\nremaining eight are distinct, but some of them intermediate in their\r\ncharacters. In the Tertiary period, intervening between the Cretaceous\r\nand the modern, fourteen species of _Sequoia_ are believed to have been\r\nrecognised, and they appear to have existed abundantly all over the\r\nnorthern hemisphere. Thus we know that these remarkable Californian\r\ngiants are the last remnant of a once widely distributed genus,\r\noriginating, as far as known, in the Cretaceous age. Now had a grove\r\nof _Sequoias_, however small, survived anywhere in Europe or Asia, and\r\nhad we no knowledge of the fossil forms, we might have been quite at\r\na loss to account for their peculiar distribution. The fossil remains\r\nof the Tertiary rocks, both animal and vegetable, present us with many\r\ninstances of this kind.\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the distribution of animals and plants, when carried\r\non in the light of geology, raises many interesting questions as to\r\ntime, which we have already glanced at, but which deserve a little more\r\nattention. As to the vast duration of geological time all geologists\r\nare agreed. It is, however, now well understood that science sets\r\ncertain limits to the time at our disposal. Edward Forbes humorously\r\ndefined a geologist to be \"an amiable enthusiast who is content if\r\nallowed to appropriate as much as he pleases of that which other men\r\nvalue least, namely, past time \"; but now even the geologist is obliged\r\nto be content with a limited quantity of this commodity.\r\n\r\nThe well-known estimate of Lord Kelvin gave one hundred millions of\r\nyears as the probable time necessary for the change of the earth from\r\nthe condition of a molten mass to that which we now see. On this\r\nestimate we might fairly have assumed fifty millions of years as\r\ncovering the time from the Laurentian age to the modern period. The\r\ngreat physicist has, however, after allowing us thus much credit in the\r\nbank of time, \"suddenly put up the shutters and declared a dividend of\r\nless than four shillings in the pound.\"[187] In other words, he has\r\nreduced the time at our disposal to twenty millions of years. Other\r\nphysicists, reasoning on the constitution of the sun, agree with this\r\nlatter estimate, and affirm that \"twenty millions of years ago the\r\nearth was enveloped in the fiery atmosphere of the sun.\"[188] Geology\r\nitself has attempted an independent calculation based on the wearing\r\ndown of our continents, which appears to proceed at the rate of about\r\na foot in four or five thousand years, and on the time required to\r\ndeposit the sediments of the several geological formations, estimated\r\nat about 70,000 feet in thickness. These calculations would give us,\r\nsay, eighty-six millions of years since the earth began to have a solid\r\ncrust, which would, like Lord Kelvin's earlier estimate, give us nearly\r\nfifty millions of years for the geological time since the introduction\r\nof life. The details of the several estimates made it would be tedious\r\nand unprofitable to enter into, but I may state as my own conclusion,\r\nthat the modern rates of denudation and deposit must be taken as far\r\nbelow the average, and that perhaps the estimate stated by Wallace on\r\ndata supplied by Houghton, namely, twenty-eight millions, may be not\r\nfar from the truth, though perhaps admitting of considerable abatement.\r\n\r\n[187] Bonney, Address before British Association, 1888.\r\n\r\n[188] Newcomb, Helmholtz, Tait, etc.\r\n\r\nThis reduced estimate of geological time would still give scope enough\r\nfor the distribution of animals and plants, but it will scarcely\r\ngive that required by certain prevalent theories of evolution. When\r\nDarwin says, \"If the theory (of natural selection) be true, it is\r\nindisputable that before the lowest Cambrian stratum was deposited\r\nlong periods elapsed, as long as, or probably far longer than, the\r\nwhole interval from the Cambrian to the present day,\" he makes a demand\r\nwhich geology cannot supply; for independently of our ignorance of\r\nany formations or fossils, except those included in the Archæan, to\r\nrepresent this vast succession of life, the time required would push\r\nus back into a molten state of the planet. This difficulty is akin to\r\nthat which meets us with reference to the introduction of many and\r\nhighly specialized mammals in the Eocene, or of the forests of modern\r\ntype in the Cretaceous. To account for the origin of these by slow and\r\ngradual evolution requires us to push these forms of life so far back\r\ninto formations which afford no trace of them, but, on the contrary,\r\ncontain other creatures that appear to be exclusive of them, that our\r\nfaith in the theory fails. The only theory of evolution which seems to\r\nmeet this difficulty is that advanced by Mivart, Leconte, and Saporta,\r\nof \"critical periods,\" or periods of rapid introduction of new species\r\nalternating with others of comparative inaction. This would much better\r\naccord with the apparently rapid introduction of many new forms of life\r\nover wide regions at the same period. It would also approach somewhat\r\nnear, in its manner of stating the problem to be solved, to the theory\r\nof \"creation by law\" as held by the Duke of Argyll, or to what may be\r\nregarded as \"mediate creation,\" proceeding in a regular and definite\r\nmanner, but under laws and forces as yet very imperfectly known,\r\nthroughout geological time.\r\n\r\nIt seems singular, in view of the facts of palæontology, that\r\nevolutionists of the Darwinian school are so wedded to the idea of one\r\nintroduction only of each form of life, and its subsequent division by\r\nvariation into different species, as it progressively spreads itself\r\nover the globe, or is subjected to different external conditions. It\r\nis evident that a little further and very natural extension of their\r\nhypothesis would enable them to get rid of many difficulties of time\r\nand space. For example, certain Millipedes and Batrachians are first\r\nknown in the coal formation, and this not in one locality only, but\r\nin different and widely separated regions. If they took beginning in\r\none place, and spread themselves gradually over the world, this must\r\nhave required a vast lapse of time--more than we can suppose probable.\r\nBut if, in the coal-formation age, a worm could anywhere change into\r\na Millipede, or a fish into a Batrachian, why might this not have\r\noccurred in many places at once? Again, if the oldest known land snails\r\noccur in the coal formation, and we find no more specimens till a much\r\nlater period, why is it necessary to suppose that these creatures\r\nexisted in the intervening time, and that the later species are the\r\ndescendants of the earlier? Might not the process have been repeated\r\nagain and again, so as to give animals of this kind to widely separated\r\nareas and successive periods without the slow and precarious methods\r\nof continuous evolution and migration? This apparent inconsistency\r\nstrikes one constantly in the study of discussions of the theory of\r\nderivation in connection with geographical and geological distribution.\r\nWe constantly find the believers in derivation laboriously devising\r\nexpedients for the migration of animals and plants to the most unlikely\r\nplaces, when it would seem that they might just as well have originated\r\nin those places by direct evolution from lower forms. Those who believe\r\nin a separate centre of creation for each species must of course invoke\r\nall geological and geographical possibilities for the dispersion of\r\nanimals and plants; but surely the evolutionist, if he has faith in his\r\ntheory, might take a more easy and obvious method, especially when in\r\nany case he is under the necessity of demanding a great lapse of time.\r\nThat he does not adopt this method perhaps implies a latent suspicion\r\nthat he must not repeat his miracle too often. He also perceives that\r\nif repeated and unlimited evolution of similar forms had actually\r\noccurred, there could have remained little specific distinctness,\r\nand the present rarity of connecting links would not have occurred.\r\nFurther, a new difficulty would have sprung up in the geographical\r\nand geological relations of species and genera, which would then have\r\nassumed too much of the aspect of a preconceived plan. It is only fair\r\nto a well-known and somewhat extreme European evolutionist, Karl Vogt,\r\nto state that he launches boldly into the ocean of multiple evolution,\r\nnot fearing to hold that identical species of mollusks have been\r\nseparately evolved in separate Swiss lakes, and that the horse has been\r\nseparately evolved in America and in Europe, in the former along a line\r\nbeginning with Eohippus, and in the latter along an entirely separate\r\nline, commencing with _Palæotherium_. The serious complications\r\nresulting from such admissions are evident, but Vogt deserves credit\r\nfor faith and consistency beyond those of his teachers.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the actual distribution of species, the question\r\nof time becomes most important when applied to the Glacial period,\r\nsince it is obvious that much of the present distribution must have\r\nbeen caused, or greatly modified, by that event. The astronomical\r\ntheory would place the close of the Glacial age as far back as 70,000\r\nor 80,000 years ago. But we have already seen in the chapter on that\r\nperiod that geological facts bring its close to only from 10,000 to\r\n7,000 years before our time. If we adopt the shorter estimates afforded\r\nby these facts, it will follow that the submergences and emergences\r\nof land in the Glacial ages were more rapid than has hitherto been\r\nsupposed, and that this would react on our estimate of time by giving\r\nfacilities for more rapid denudation and deposition. Such results would\r\ngreatly shorten the duration assignable to the human period. They\r\nwould render it less remarkable that no new species of animals seem to\r\nhave been introduced since the Glacial age, that many insular faunas\r\nbelong to far earlier times, and that no changes even leading to the\r\nproduction of well-marked varieties have occurred in the post-glacial\r\nor modern age.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, does all this array of fact and reasoning bring us any\r\nnearer to the comprehension of that \"mystery of mysteries,\" the origin\r\nand succession of life? It certainly does not enable us to point to any\r\nspecies, and to say precisely here, at this time and thus it originated.\r\nIf we adopt the theory of evolution, the facts seem to restrict us to\r\nthat form of it which admits paroxysmal or intermittent introduction of\r\nspecies, depending on the concurrence of conditions favourable to the\r\naction of the power, whatever it may be, which produces new organisms.\r\nNor is there anything in the facts of distribution to invalidate the\r\nbelief in creation, according to definite laws, if that really differs\r\nin its nature from certain forms of the hypothesis of evolution. We\r\nhave also learned that, time being given, animals and plants manifest\r\nwonderful powers of migration, that they can vary within considerable\r\nlimits without ceasing to be practically the same species, and that\r\nunder certain conditions they can endure far longer in some places than\r\nin others. We also see evidence that it is not on limited islands,\r\nbut on the continents, that land animals and plants have originated,\r\nand that swarms of new and vigorous species have issued from the more\r\nnorthern regions in successive periods of favourable Arctic climate.\r\nThe last of these new swarms or \"centres of creation,\" that with which\r\nman himself is more closely connected, belongs to the Palearctic\r\nregion. We have already seen that in every geological period, when the\r\nsubmerged continental plateaus were pervaded by the warm equatorial\r\nwaters, multitudes of new marine species appear. In times when, on\r\nthe contrary, the colder Arctic currents poured over these submerged\r\nsurfaces, carrying mud and stones, great extinction took place, but\r\ncertain northern forms of life swarmed abundantly, and when elevation\r\ntook place, marine species became extinct or were forced to migrate.\r\nEverywhere and at all times multiplication of species was promoted\r\nby facilities for expansion. The great limestones of our continents,\r\nfull of corals and shells of new species, belong to times when the\r\nocean spread itself over the continental plateaus, affording wide,\r\nuntenanted areas of warm and shallow water. The introduction of new\r\nfaunas and floras on the land belongs to times when vast supplies of\r\nfood for plants and animals and favourable conditions of existence were\r\nafforded by the emergence of new lands possessing fertile soils and\r\nabundantly supplied with light, heat, and moisture. Thus geological and\r\ngeographical facts concur with ordinary observation and experience in\r\nreference to varietal forms, in testifying that it is not mere struggle\r\nfor existence, but facilities for easy existence and rapid extension,\r\nthat afford the conditions necessary for new and advanced forms of\r\nlife. These considerations do not, of course, reach to the first cause\r\nof the introduction of species, nor even to the precise mode in which\r\nthis may have acted in any particular case: but perhaps we cannot\r\nfully attain to this by any process of inductive inquiry. The study of\r\ngeographical distribution,' therefore, does not enable us to solve the\r\nquestion of the origin of specific types, but, on the contrary, points\r\nto marvellous capacities for migration and a wonderful tenacity of life\r\nin species. In these respects, however, it is a study full of interest,\r\nand in nothing more so than in the evidence which it affords of the\r\npractically infinite provisions made for the peopling of every spot of\r\nland or sea with creatures fitted to flourish and enjoy life therein,\r\nand to carry on the great and progressive plan of the Creator.\r\n\r\n  References:--Continental and Island Life, _Princeton Review_, July,\r\n    1881.

This\r\ngreat ridge or succession of ridges has its highest peaks near its\r\nsouthern extremity, in the Black Mountains; but these are little\r\nhigher than their northern rivals, which at least hold the undisputed\r\ndistinction of being the highest hills in north-eastern America. As\r\nGuyot[189] has well remarked, the White Mountains do not occur in\r\nthe general line of the chain, but rather on its eastern side. The\r\ncentral point of the range, represented by the Green Mountains and\r\ntheir continuation, describes a great curve from Gaspé to the valley\r\nof the Hudson, and opposite the middle of the concave side of this\r\ncurved line towers the almost isolated group of the White Hills. On the\r\nother side is the narrow valley of Lake Champlain, and beyond this the\r\ngreat isolated mass of the Adirondack Mountains, nearly approaching in\r\nthe altitude of their highest peaks, and greatly exceeding in their\r\ngeological age, the opposite White Mountain group. The Appalachian\r\nrange is thus, in this part of its course, supported on either side by\r\noutliers higher than itself. The dense grouping of mountains in this\r\nregion is due to the resistance offered by the old Adirondack mass\r\nto the westward thrust of the Atlantic and the subsequent piling up\r\nagainst this mass of the ridges of palæozoic sediments. Southward of\r\nthis the Atlantic thrust has driven these ridges back in a great bend\r\nto the westward.\r\n\r\n[189] _Silliman's Journal._\r\n\r\nMy present purpose is not to give a general geographical or geological\r\nsketch of the White Mountains, but to direct attention to the\r\nvegetation which clothes their summits, and its relation to the history\r\nof the mountains themselves. For this purpose I may first shortly\r\ndescribe the appearances presented in ascending the highest of them,\r\nMount Washington, and then turn to the special points to which these\r\nnotes relate.\r\n\r\nIn approaching Mount Washington by the Grand Trunk Railway, the\r\ntraveller has ascended from the valley of the St. Lawrence to a height\r\nof 802 feet at the Alpine House at Gorham. Thence, in a distance of\r\nabout eight miles along the bank of the Peabody River, to the Glen\r\nHouse, he ascends to the elevation of 1,632 feet above the sea; and it\r\nis here, or immediately opposite the Glen House, that the actual ascent\r\nbegins. The distance from the Peabody River, opposite the hotel, to\r\nthe summit is nine miles, and in this distance we ascend 4,656 feet,\r\nthe total height being 6,288 feet above the sea.[190] Formerly only a\r\nbridle path led up this ascent; but now access can be had to the summit\r\nby carriage roads and by rail.\r\n\r\n[190] According to Guyot, but some recent surveys make it a little\r\nhigher.\r\n\r\nThese royal roads to the summit are, however, too democratic for the\r\ntaste of some visitors, who mourn the olden days of ponies, guides and\r\nadventures; and though they give an excellent view of the geological\r\nstructure of the mountain, they do not afford a good opportunity for\r\nthe study of the alpine flora, which is one of the chief attractions\r\nof Mount Washington. For this reason, though I availed myself of the\r\nnew road for gaining a general idea of the features of the group,\r\nI determined to ascend by Tuckerman's Ravine, a great chasm in the\r\nmountain side, named in honour of the indefatigable botanist of the\r\nNorth American lichens.[191] I was aided in this by the kindness of a\r\ngentleman of Boston, well acquainted with these hills, and passionately\r\nfond of their scenery.[192] Our party, in addition to this gentleman\r\nand myself, consisted of two ladies, two children, and two experienced\r\nguides, whose services were of the utmost importance, not only in\r\nindicating the path, but in removing windfalls and other obstructions,\r\nand in assisting members of the party over difficult and dangerous\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n[191] Peck, Bigelow and Booth were the early botanical explorers of the\r\nWhite Mountains; though Pursh was the first to determine some of the\r\nmore interesting plants, and Oakes and Tuckerman deserve honourable\r\nmention, as the most thorough modern explorers.\r\n\r\n[192] Mr. Raymond.\r\n\r\nWe followed the carriage road for two miles, and then struck off to the\r\nleft by a bridle path that seemed not to have been used for several\r\nyears the gentlemen and guides on foot, the ladies and children mounted\r\non the sure-footed ponies used in these ascents. Our path wound around\r\na spur of the mountain, over rocky and uneven ground, much of the rock\r\nbeing mica slate, with beautiful cruciform crystals of andalusite,\r\nwhich seemed larger and finer here than in any other part of the\r\nmountain which I visited. At first the vegetation was not materially\r\ndifferent from that of the lower grounds, but as we gradually ascended\r\nwe entered the \"evergreen zone,\" and passed through dense thickets of\r\nsmall spruces and firs, the ground beneath which was carpeted with\r\nmoss, and studded with an immense profusion of the delicate little\r\nmountain wood sorrel (_Oxalis acetosella_), a characteristic plant of\r\nwooded hills on both sides of the Atlantic, and which I had not before\r\nseen in such profusion since I had roamed on the hills of Lochaber\r\nLake in Nova Scotia. Other herbaceous plants were rare, except ferns\r\nand club mosses; but we picked up an aster (_A. acuminatus_), a golden\r\nrod (_Solidago thyrsoidea_), and the very pretty tway blade (_Listera\r\ncordata_), a species[193] very widely distributed throughout British\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[193] _L. macrophylla_ Pursh (Macoun).\r\n\r\nIn ascending the mountain directly, the spruces of this zone gradually\r\ndegenerate, until they present the appearance of little gnarled\r\nbushes, flat on top and closely matted together, so that except where\r\npaths have been cut, it is almost impossible to penetrate among them.\r\nFinally, they lie flat on the ground, and become so small that, as\r\nLyell remarks, the reindeer moss may be seen to overtop the spruces.\r\nThis dwarfing of the spruces and firs is the effect of adverse\r\ncircumstances, and of their struggle to extend their range toward the\r\nsummit. Year by year they stretch forth their roots and branches,\r\nbending themselves to the ground, clinging to the bare rocks, and\r\navailing themselves of every chasm and fissure that may cover their\r\nadvance; but the conditions of the case are against them. If their\r\nfront advances in summer, it is driven back in winter, and if in a\r\nsuccession of mild seasons they are able to gain a little ground, less\r\nfavourable seasons recur, and wither or destroy the holders of their\r\nadvanced positions. For thousands of years the spruces and firs have\r\nstriven in this hopeless escalade, but about 4,000 feet above the sea\r\nseems to be the limit of their advance, and unless the climate shall\r\nchange, or these trees acquire a new plasticity of constitution, the\r\ngenus _Abies_ can never displace the hardier alpine inhabitants above,\r\nand plant its standard on the summit of Mount Washington.\r\n\r\nI was struck by the similarity of this dwarfing of the upper edges of\r\nthe spruce woods, to that which I have often observed on the exposed\r\nnorthern coasts of Cape Breton and Prince Edward Island, where the\r\nwoods often gradually diminish in height toward the beach or the edge\r\nof a cliff, till the external row of plants clings closely to the soil,\r\nor rises above it only a few inches. The causes are the same, but the\r\nappearance is more marked on the mountain than on the coast. It is in\r\nminiature a picture of the gradual dwarfing of vegetation in the great\r\nbarren grounds of Arctic America.\r\n\r\nOn the path which we followed, before we reached the upper limit\r\nof trees, we arrived at the base of a stupendous cliff, forming the\r\ntermination of a promontory or spur of the mountain, separating\r\nTuckerman's Ravine from another deep depression known as the Great\r\nGulf. From the top of this precipice poured a little cascade, that lost\r\nitself in spray long before it touched the tops of the trees below. The\r\nview at this place was the most impressive that it was my fortune to\r\nsee in these hills.\r\n\r\nOpposite the mouth of the Great Gulf, and I suppose at a height of\r\nabout 3,000 feet, is a little pond known as Hermit Lake. It is nearly\r\ncircular, and appears to be retained by a ridge of stones and gravel,\r\nperhaps an old moraine or sea beach. On its margin piped a solitary\r\nsandpiper, a few dragon flies flitted over its surface, and tadpoles in\r\nthe bottom indicated that some species of frog dwells in its waters.\r\nHigh overhead, and skirting the edges of the precipices, soared an\r\neagle, intent, no doubt, on the hares that frequent the thickets of the\r\nravines.\r\n\r\nBefore we reached Hermit Lake we had been obliged to leave our horses,\r\nand now we turned aside to the left and entered Tuckerman's ravine,\r\nwhere there is no path, but merely the bed of a brook, whose cold clear\r\nwater tumbles in a succession of cascades over huge polished masses\r\nof white gneiss, while on both sides of it the bottom of the ravine\r\nis occupied by dense and almost impenetrable thickets of the mountain\r\nalder (_Alnus viridis_).\r\n\r\nTuckerman's Ravine has been formed originally either by a subsidence\r\nof a portion of the mountain side, or by the action of the sea. It\r\nis, like most of the ravines and \"gulfs\" of these hills, a deep cut\r\nor depression bounded by precipitous sides and terminating at the top\r\nin a similarly precipitous manner. It must at one period have been in\r\npart filled with boulder clay, steep banks of which still remain in\r\nplaces on its sides; and extensive landslips have occurred, by which\r\nportions of the limiting cliffs have been thrown toward the centre of\r\nthe valley, in large piles of angular blocks of gneiss and mica slate,\r\nin the spaces between which grow gnarled birches and spruces that must\r\nbe used as ladders and bridges whereby to scramble from block to block,\r\nby every one who would cross or ascend one of these rivers of stones.\r\nThese \"gulfs\" of the White Mountains are similar to the \"cirques\" of\r\nthe Alps, and various explanations have been given of their origin. To\r\nme they have always appeared to be of the same nature with the \"chines\"\r\nor bays with precipitous ends seen on rocky coasts, and which are\r\nproduced by the action of the surf on the softer beds or veins of rock.\r\nThey testify to the raging of the waves for long ages against the sides\r\nof what are now lofty mountains. This, we know, must have occurred in\r\nthe great Pleistocene submergence; but in mountains so old as those now\r\nin question, it may have in part been effected in previous periods.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the ravine we paused to rest, to admire the wild\r\nprospect presented by the ravine and its precipitous sides, and to\r\ncollect the numerous plants that flower on the surrounding slopes and\r\nprecipices. Here, on the 19th of August, were several large patches of\r\nsnow, one of them about a hundred yards in length. From the precipice\r\nat the head of the ravine poured hundreds of little rills, and several\r\nof them collecting into a brook, had excavated in the largest mass of\r\nsnow a long tunnel or cavern with an arched and groined roof. Under the\r\nfront of this we took our mid-day meal, with the hot August sun pouring\r\nits rays in front of us, and icy water gurgling among the stones at our\r\nfeet. Around the margin of the snow the vegetation presented precisely\r\nthe same appearances which are seen in the low country in March and\r\nApril, when the snow banks have just disappeared--the old grass\r\nbleached and whitened, and many perennial plants sending up blanched\r\nshoots which had not yet experienced the influence of the sunlight.\r\n\r\nThe vegetation at the head of this ravine and on the precipices that\r\noverhang it, presents a remarkable mixture of lowland and mountain\r\nspecies. The head of the ravine is not so high as the limit of trees\r\nalready stated, but its steep sides rise abruptly to a plateau of 5,000\r\nfeet in height, intervening between Mount Washington and Mount Munro,\r\nand on which are the dark ponds or tarns known as the Lakes of the\r\nClouds, forming the sources of the Amonoosook river, which flows in\r\nthe opposite direction. From this plateau many alpine plants stretch\r\ndownward into the ravine, while lowland plants, availing themselves\r\nof the shelter and moisture of this _cul-de-sac_, climb boldly upward\r\nalmost to the higher plateau. Other species again occur here, which\r\nare found neither on the exposed alpine summits and ridges, nor in\r\nthe low country. Conspicuous among the hardy climbers are two coarse\r\nand poisonous weeds of the river valleys, that look like intruders\r\ninto the company of the more dwarfish alpine plants;--the cow parsnip\r\n(_Heracleum lanatum_) and the white hellebore (_Veratrum viride_).\r\nBoth of these plants were seen struggling up through the ground at the\r\nmargin of the snow, and climbing up moist hollows almost to the tops\r\nof the precipices. Some specimens of the latter were crowded with the\r\ninfant caterpillars of a mountain butterfly or moth. Less conspicuous,\r\nand better suited to the surrounding vegetation, were the bluets\r\n(_Oldenlandia cœrulea_), now in blossom here, as they had been months\r\nbefore in the low country, the dwarf cornel (_Cornus Canadensis_) and\r\nthe twin-flower (_Linnæa borealis_), the latter reaching quite to\r\nthe plateau of the lake of the Clouds, and entering into undisputed\r\ncompanionship with the truly alpine plants, though it is also found at\r\nGorham, 4,000 feet lower.\r\n\r\nOf the plants which seemed to be confined, or nearly so, to the upper\r\npart of the ravine, one of the most interesting was the northern\r\npainted cup (_Castelleia septentrionalis_), a plant which abounds on\r\nthe coast of Labrador, and extends thence through all Arctic North\r\nAmerica to the Rocky Mountains, and is perhaps identical with the _C.\r\nSibirica_ of Northern Asia and the _C. pallida_ of Northern Europe.\r\nLarge beds of it were covered with their pale yellow blossoms on the\r\nprecipitous banks overhanging the head of the ravine. With the painted\r\ncup, and here alone, was another beautiful species of a very different\r\norder, the northern green orchis (_Platanthera hyperborea_), a plant\r\nwhich occurs, though rarely, in Canada, but is more abundant to the\r\nnorthward. Here also occurred Peck's geum (_G. radiatum_, var.),\r\n_Arnica mollis_, and several other interesting plants.\r\n\r\nOf the alpine plants which descend into the ravine, the most\r\ninteresting was the Greenland sand-wort (_Arenaria_ (_Alsine_)\r\n_Grænlandica_) which was blooming abundantly, with its clusters of\r\ndelicate white flowers, on the very summit of the mountain, and could\r\nbe found here and there by the side of the brook in the bottom of the\r\nravine.\r\n\r\nClambering by a steep and dangerous path up the right side of the\r\nravine, we reach almost at once the limit, beyond which the ordinary\r\nflora of New England can extend no longer, and are in the presence of\r\na new group of plants comparable with those of Labrador and Greenland.\r\nHere, on the plateau of the Lake of the Clouds, the traveller who has\r\nascended the giddy precipices overhanging Tuckerman's Ravine is glad\r\nto pause, that he may contemplate the features of the new region which\r\nhe has reached. We have left the snow behind us, except a small patch\r\nwhich lingers on the shady side of Mount Munro; for it is only in the\r\nravines into which it has drifted a hundred feet deep or more, that\r\nit can withstand the summer heat until August. We stand on a dreary\r\nwaste of hard angular blocks of mica slate and gneiss that lie in rude\r\nridges, as if they had been roughly raked up by Titans, who might have\r\nbeen trying to pile Monro upon Washington, but which seem to be merely\r\nthe remains of the original outcropping edges of the rocks broken up\r\nby the frost, but not disturbed or rounded by water.[194] Behind us\r\nis the deep trench-like ravine out of which we have climbed; on the\r\nleft hand a long row of secondary summits stretching out from Mount\r\nWashington to the south-westward, and designated by the names of a\r\nseries of American statesmen. In front this range descends abruptly\r\nin great wooded spurs or buttresses to the valley of the Amonoosook,\r\nwhich shines in silvery spots through the trees far below. On our\r\nright hand towers the peak of Mount Washington, still more than a\r\nthousand feet above us, and covered with angular blocks, as if it\r\nwere a pile of fragments rather than a solid rock. These stones all\r\naround and up to the summit of the mountain, are tinted pale green\r\nby the map lichen (_Lecidea geographica_), which tinges in the same\r\nway the alpine summits of European mountains. Between the blocks\r\nand on their sheltered sides nestle the alpine flowering plants, of\r\nwhich twenty species or more may be collected on this shoulder of the\r\nmountain, and some of which extend themselves to the very summit,\r\nwhere _Alsine Grœnlandica_ and the little tufts of deep green leaves\r\nof _Diapensia Lapponica_ with a few Carices seem to luxuriate. Animal\r\nlife accompanies these plants to the summit, near which I saw a family\r\nof the snow bird, evidently summer residents here, instead of seeking\r\nthe far north for a breeding place, as is the habit of the species, and\r\na number of insects, conspicuous among which was a brown butterfly of\r\nthe genus _Hipparchia_. Shortly before sundown, when the thermometer at\r\nthe summit house was fast settling toward the freezing point, a number\r\nof swallows were hawking for flies at a great height above the highest\r\npeak. To what species they belonged I could not ascertain. Possibly\r\nthe cliff swallows find breeding places in the sides of the ravines,\r\nand rise over the hill top to bask in the sunbeams, after the mountain\r\nhas thrown its shadows over their homes.\r\n\r\n[194] Hitchcock has since found travelled blocks on the summit, bearing\r\nevidence to its submergence under the waves of the glacial sea, and\r\nto the grinding of ice floes upon it. Such a fact helps to account\r\nfor the broken character of the summit, and also implies that unequal\r\nsubsidence of the land elsewhere referred to, since we know of no\r\nagency which could carry boulders so high as the present mountain top.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Alpine flora which is peculiar to the peaks of these\r\nmountains--are the species comprising it autochthones originating on\r\nthese hill tops, and confined to them, or are they plants occurring\r\nelsewhere, and if so, where? and how and when did they migrate to their\r\npresent abodes? These are questions which must occur to every one\r\ninterested in geology, botany, or physical geography.\r\n\r\nNot one of the Alpine plants of Mount Washington is peculiar to\r\nthe place. Nearly all of them are distinct from the plants of the\r\nneighbouring lowlands, but they occur on other hills of New England\r\nand New York, and on the distant coasts of Labrador and Greenland, and\r\nsome of them are distributed over the Arctic regions of Europe, Asia\r\nand America. In short, they are stragglers from that Arctic flora which\r\nencompasses the north polar region, and extends in promontories and\r\nislands along the high cold mountain summits far to the southward.\r\n\r\nSome of the humble flowerless plants of these hills are of nearly\r\nworld-wide distribution. I have already noticed the pale green map\r\nlichen which tints the rocks of the Pyrenees, the Alps, and the\r\nScottish Highlands; and the curious ring lichen (_Parmelia centrifuga_)\r\npaints its conspicuous rings and arcs of circles alike on Mount\r\nWashington and the Scottish hills. A little club moss (_Lycopodium\r\nselago_) is not only widely distributed over the northern hemisphere,\r\nbut Hooker has recognised it in the Antarctic regions. Not long ago we\r\nunrolled in Montreal an Egyptian mummy, preserved in the oldest style\r\nof embalming, and found that, to preserve the odour of the spices,\r\nquantities of a lichen (_Evernia furfuracea_) had been wrapped around\r\nthe body, and have no doubt been imported into Egypt from Lebanon, or\r\nthe hills of Macedonia, for such uses. Yet the specimens from this old\r\nmummy were at once recognised by Professor Tuckerman as identical with\r\nthis species as it occurs on the White Hills and on Katahdin, in Maine.\r\nThese facts are, however, easily explicable in comparison with those\r\nthat relate to the flowering plants.\r\n\r\nThe spores of lichens and mosses float lighter than the lightest down\r\nin the air, and may be wafted over land and sea, and dropped everywhere\r\nto grow where conditions may be favourable. We can form an idea of this\r\nfrom the fact that the volcanic dust, consisting of shreds of pumice,\r\netc., thrown up by the eruption of Krakatoa, in 1883, was wafted, in a\r\nday or two, round the globe, and remained suspended for months in the\r\natmosphere. The spores of many cryptogamous plants are even lighter\r\nthan volcanic dust. Had the Egyptian embalmer used some of the first\r\ncreated specimens of _Evernia furfuracea_, it might easily, within the\r\nthree thousand years or so since his work was done, have floated round\r\nthe world and established itself on the White Hills. But, as we shall\r\nsee, neither the time nor means would suffice for the flowering plants.\r\nThe only available present agency for the transmission of these would\r\nbe in the crops or the plumage of the migratory birds; and when we\r\nconsider how few of these, on their migrations from the north, could\r\never alight on these hills, and the rarity of their carrying seeds in\r\na state fit to vegetate, and further, that few of these plants produce\r\nfruits edible by birds, or seeds likely to attach themselves to their\r\nfeathers, the chances become infinitely small of their transmission in\r\nthis way. The most profitable course of investigation in this and most\r\nother cases of apparently unaccountable geographical distribution, is\r\nto inquire as to the past geological conditions of the region, and how\r\nthese may have affected the migrations of plants.\r\n\r\nThe earlier geological history of these mountains far antedates our\r\nexisting vegetation. It belongs, in the first instance, to the Archæan\r\nand early Palæozoic period, in which the materials of these mountains\r\nwere accumulating, as beds of clay and gravel, in the sea bottom. These\r\nwere buried under great depths of newer deposits, and were folded\r\nand crumpled by lateral pressure, baked and metamorphosed into their\r\npresent crystalline condition.[195] Again heaved above the sea level,\r\nthey were hewn by the action of the waves to some degree into their\r\npresent forms, and constituted part of the nucleus of the American\r\ncontinent in the later Tertiary period, when they were probably higher\r\nthan now. They were again, with all the surrounding land, depressed\r\nunder the sea in the Pleistocene period, and in the Post-glacial or\r\nmodern, slowly upheaved again to their present height. These last\r\nchanges are those that concern their present flora, and their relations\r\nto it are well stated by Sir C. Lyell in the following passages from\r\nhis interesting account of his ascent of Mount Washington in 1840.\r\n\r\n[195] While the mass of the White Mountains is probably older than the\r\nSilurian, there are beds of mica schist which contain corals of the\r\ngenus Halysites, and stems of large crinoids.\r\n\r\n\"If we attempt to speculate on the manner in which the peculiar\r\nspecies of plants now established on the highest summits of the White\r\nMountains were enabled to reach those isolated spots, while none of\r\nthem are met with in the lower lands around, or for a great distance\r\nto the north, we shall find ourselves trying to solve a philosophical\r\nproblem which requires the aid, not of botany alone, but of geology,\r\nor a knowledge of the geographical changes which immediately preceded\r\nthe present state of the earth's surface. We have to explain how\r\nan Arctic flora, consisting of plants specifically identical with\r\nthose which inhabit lands bordering the sea in the extreme north of\r\nAmerica, Europe and Asia, could get to the top of Mount Washington.\r\nNow geology teaches us that the species living at present on the earth\r\nare older than many parts of our existing continents; that is to say,\r\nthey were created before a large portion of the existing mountains,\r\nvalleys, plains, lakes, rivers, and seas were formed. That such must\r\nbe the case in regard to Sicily I announced my conviction in 1833,\r\nafter first returning from that country; and a similar conclusion\r\nis no less obvious to any naturalist who has studied the structure\r\nof North America, and observed the wide area occupied by the modern\r\nor glacial deposits, in which marine shells of living but northern\r\nspecies are entombed. It is clear that a great portion of Canada, and\r\nthe country surrounding the great lakes, was submerged beneath the\r\nocean when recent species of molluska flourished, of which the fossil\r\nremains occur about 500 feet above the level of the sea at Montreal.\r\nLake Champlain was a gulf or strait of the sea at that period, large\r\nareas in Maine were under water, and the White Mountains must then\r\nhave constituted an island or group of islands. Yet, as this period\r\nis so modern in the earth's history as to belong to the epoch of the\r\nexisting marine fauna, it is fair to infer that the Arctic flora, now\r\ncontemporary with this, was then also established on the globe.\r\n\r\n\"A careful study of the present distribution of animals and plants\r\nover the globe has led nearly all the best naturalists to the opinion\r\nthat each species had its origin in a single birthplace, and spread\r\ngradually from its original centre to all accessible spots fit for its\r\nhabitation, by means of the powers of migration given to it from the\r\nfirst. If we adopt this view, or the doctrine of specific centres,\r\nthere is no difficulty in comprehending how the _Cryptogamous_ plants\r\nof Siberia, Lapland, Greenland and Labrador scaled the heights of Mount\r\nWashington, because the sporules of the fungi, lichens and mosses may\r\nbe wafted through the air for indefinite distances, like smoke; and,\r\nin fact, heavier particles are actually known to have been carried\r\nfor thousands of miles by the wind. But the cause of the occurrence\r\nof Arctic plants of the _Phænogamous_ class on the top of the New\r\nHampshire Mountains, specifically identical with those of remote polar\r\nregions, is by no means so obvious. They could not in the present\r\ncondition of the earth effect a passage over the intervening lowlands,\r\nbecause the extreme heat of summer and cold of winter would be fatal to\r\nthem. We must suppose, therefore, that originally they extended their\r\nrange in the same way as the plants now inhabiting Arctic and Antarctic\r\nlands disseminate themselves. The innumerable islands in the polar seas\r\nare tenanted by the same species of plants, some of which are conveyed\r\nas seeds by animals over the ice, when the sea is frozen in winter,\r\nor by birds; while a still larger number are transported by floating\r\nicebergs and field ice, on which soil containing the seeds of plants\r\nmay be carried in a single year for hundreds of miles. A great body of\r\ngeological evidence has now been brought together to show that this\r\nmachinery for scattering plants, as well as for carrying erratic blocks\r\nsouthward, and polishing and grooving the floor of the ancient ocean,\r\nextended in the western hemisphere to lower latitudes than that of the\r\nWhite Mountains. When these last still constituted islands, in a sea\r\nchilled by the melting of floating ice, we may assume that they were\r\ncovered entirely by a flora like that now confined to the uppermost or\r\ntreeless region of the mountains, except in such portions of the period\r\nas were sufficiently cold to clothe their summits permanently in snow.\r\nAs the continent grew by the slow upheaval of the land, and the islands\r\ngained in height, and the climate around these hills grew milder, the\r\nArctic plants would retreat to higher zones, and finally occupy an\r\nelevated area, which probably had been, at first, or in the Glacial\r\nperiod, always covered with perpetual snow. Meanwhile the newly formed\r\nplains around the base of the mountain, to which northern species of\r\nplants could not spread, would be occupied by others migrating from\r\nthe south, and perhaps by many trees, shrubs, and plants, then first\r\ncreated, and remaining to this day peculiar to North America.\"\r\n\r\nThe time to which the above views of Sir. C. Lyell would refer the\r\nmigration of the White Mountain flora, is historically, very remote.\r\nThe changes of level which have submerged the American continent and\r\nre-elevated its land have occupied long periods. Whether, with Lyell,\r\nwe measure these periods by the recession of the Falls of Niagara,\r\nor by the growth of the alluvial plain of the Mississippi; or, with\r\nAgassiz, by the extension of the peninsula of Florida, or endeavour to\r\nestimate the time required for the abrasion and deposition of the great\r\nmass of clay that fills the valley of the St. Lawrence, and allowing\r\nfor the reductions of the antiquity of the Glacial period arising from\r\nrecent observations and calculations, we cannot suppose that less than\r\n8,000 or 10,000 years have elapsed since the Alpine plants of the White\r\nMountains were cut off from all connection with their Arctic relatives.\r\nTheir reign upon the mountain tops not only antedates all human\r\ndynasties, but probably reaches beyond the creation of man himself, and\r\nmany of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nPositive evidence of the existence of some of these plants during a\r\nlarge portion of this lapse of time has actually been preserved in\r\nthe Pleistocene deposits of Canada. At Green's Creek, on the Ottawa,\r\nin nodules in the clay containing marine shells, and coeval with the\r\nLeda clay of Montreal, there are numerous remains of plants that have\r\nbeen embedded in this clay at a time when the Ottawa valley was a bay\r\nor estuary, and when the Adirondack Mountains of New York and the\r\nmountains of New England were two rocky islands, separated from each\r\nother and from the mainland on the north by wide arms of the sea. The\r\nplants found in these nodules all appear to be of modern species.\r\nSeveral of these plants are found on the White Mountains, and they are\r\nall northern or boreal, but scarcely Arctic, belonging as they do to\r\nthe southern margin of the Arctic land species. I have no doubt that\r\nfurther examination of these deposits will lead to the discovery of\r\nadditional examples. This fact, proving as it does the existence of\r\nthese species at the period in which the theory of Lyell and Forbes\r\nrequires them to have migrated, is in itself strong corroborative\r\nevidence. We can say that some of these species were waiting on the\r\nshores of the north, ready to be drifted to the insular spots to the\r\nsouth-west, and that their seeds were actually being washed out to sea\r\nby the streams which emptied themselves into the then estuary of the\r\nOttawa.\r\n\r\nAnother aspect of the inquiry is that which relates to the reduction of\r\ntemperature, which might be consequent on the great depression of the\r\nland which we know to have existed at the close of the Tertiary period,\r\na fact on which I have insisted in former papers on the Pleistocene\r\ndeposits of Canada.[196] A very clever writer on the subject of\r\ngeographical distribution[197] has pictured the case of a subsiding\r\ncontinent, with the fauna and flora of its lowlands becoming gradually\r\nconcentrated on the spots which had previously been Alpine summits, but\r\nnow reduced to low and temperate islands. But he has left out of view\r\nthe fact, that if land still existed in mass in the Arctic regions, and\r\nif the subsidence was that of land in temperate regions, and if the\r\nremaining islands were encompassed with cold and ice-laden currents,\r\nthen, on the principles long ago so well stated by Sir C. Lyell, these\r\nislands might have a mean temperature far below that of the former\r\nplains, and might, in consequence, be suitable only to such an Alpine\r\nflora as that which they had previously borne.\r\n\r\n[196] _Canadian Naturalist_, vol. iv.\r\n\r\n[197] Wollaston.\r\n\r\nNow this is precisely what seems to have occurred in the Pleistocene\r\nperiod. The Arctic land remained in great mass, detaching into the sea\r\nannual crops of icebergs and fields of coast ice, which have strewed\r\nall the northern hemisphere with boulders: the temperate regions were\r\nsubmerged, except a few insular spots. These are the very conditions\r\nrequired for a low mean temperature, both in the sea and on the land,\r\nand these geographical conditions correspond precisely with the facts\r\nas indicated by the fossil animals and plants of the period. We must\r\nbear in mind, however, that under certain contingencies the high\r\nmountain summits might have been clad in snow and ice, like Greenland,\r\nand the Alpine plants might have been able to live only on their\r\nmargins.\r\n\r\nFurther, it would be easy to show that the Alpine plants of Mount\r\nWashington would thrive under such conditions as those supposed, at\r\nthe sea level; a low and equable temperature, with a moist atmosphere,\r\nbeing that which they most desire, and their greatest enemy being the\r\ndry parching heat of the plains of the temperate regions. Those of\r\nthem, such as _Potentilla tridentata_ and _Alsine Grœnlandica_, which\r\noccur in low ground within the limits of the United States, are found\r\nunder shaded woods, in damp ravines, or on the moist sea-coast; and\r\nas we follow the coasts northward, we find these plants, on these and\r\non neighbouring islands, in lower latitudes than those in which they\r\noccur inland. This is well seen in Northern New Brunswick and in the\r\nsouth shore of the St. Lawrence, where several northern species occur\r\nin shady and moist localities. I have, for example, collected _Cornus\r\nSuecica_ and the Alpine birch in such places. When the summer mists\r\nroll around the summit of Mount Washington, it is in every respect the\r\nprecise counterpart of an islet anywhere on the coast of America, from\r\nCape Breton to the Arctic seas, and when winter wraps everything in\r\na mantle of snow, all these lands are in like manner under the same\r\nconditions. So, in the Pleistocene period, though the islets of the\r\nWhite Mountains may have experienced a less degree of winter cold, they\r\nmust have had very nearly the same summer temperature as now; and as\r\nthis is the season of growth for our Alpine and Arctic plants, it is\r\nits character that determines the suitableness of the locality to them.\r\n\r\nThose stupendous vicissitudes of land and water which have changed the\r\naspect of continents, and swept into destruction races of gigantic\r\nquadrupeds, have dealt gently with these Alpine plants, which long\r\nages ago looked out upon a waste of ice-laden waters that had engulfed\r\nthe Pliocene land with all its inhabitants, as securely as they now\r\nlook down upon the pleasant valleys of New England. It is curious, too,\r\nthat the humbler tenants of the sea have shared a similar exemption. In\r\nthe clay banks of the Saco, on the shores of Lake Champlain, and mixed\r\nwith the remains of these very plants in the valley of the Ottawa, are\r\nshells that now live in the Gulf of St. Lawrence and on the coast of\r\nMaine, intermixed with other species that are now found only in a few\r\nbays of the Arctic seas. Just as in the Post-pliocene clays of the\r\nOttawa, the remains of northern plants are found in the same nodule\r\nwith those of _Leda glacialis_, so now similar associations maybe\r\ntaking place on the coasts at the mouth of the Great Fish River. Truly,\r\nin nature as in grace, God hath chosen the weak things of the world to\r\nconfound those that are mighty, and has left in the earth's geological\r\nhistory, monuments of His respect and regard for the humblest of His\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice here that Greenland, at the present time,\r\npresents conditions as to vegetation which may, in some respects,\r\ncorrespond to those of the White Mountains in Pleistocene times. Its\r\nflora, though altogether Arctic, contains 386 species, none of which\r\nare peculiar to it, but many of them range quite round the Polar\r\ncircle. Of those that are not so generally distributed, some, more\r\nespecially on the west coast, are common to Greenland and Arctic\r\nAmerica. Others, and a larger number, more especially on the east\r\ncoast, are common to Greenland, Iceland and Norway, between which and\r\nGreenland there may have been a closer land connection than now, in\r\nPliocene and Post-glacial times.\r\n\r\nWe look in vain among the Alpine plants, so long isolated in these\r\nmountains, for any evidence of decided change in specific characters.\r\nThe Alpine plants, for ages separated from their Arctic brethren,\r\nare true to their kinds, and show little tendency to vary, and none\r\nto adapt themselves to new forms in the sunny plains below. This is\r\nespecially noteworthy on Mount Washington and the neighbouring peaks,\r\nbecause the soil of these is the same with that of the valleys.\r\nSeveral of the plants peculiar to these hills, as the black crowberry\r\n(_Empetrum nigrum_), for instance, even when other conditions are\r\nfavourable, shun rich calcareous soils, and affect those of granitic\r\norigin. In many cases the difference in soil is a sufficient reason for\r\nthe non-occurrence of such plants, except on certain hills. At Murray\r\nBay, and on the shores of Lake Superior, the plant above named occurs\r\nonly on the Laurentian gneiss. In Nova Scotia, its relative, _Corema\r\nConradi_, is confined to the granite barrens of the south coast. Many\r\nsuch plants skirt the whole Laurentian range from Labrador to Lake\r\nSuperior, but refuse to extend themselves over the calcareous plains\r\nof Canada. But in the White Hills the soil of the river alluvium is\r\nthe same micaceous sand that fills the crevices of the rocks in the\r\nmountains, and hence there is no obstruction, in so far as soil is\r\nconcerned, to the diffusion of plants upward and downward in the hills.\r\nIn like manner there is every possible condition as to moisture and\r\ndryness, sunshine and shade, in both localities. These circumstances\r\nare of all others the most favourable to such variation as these plants\r\nare capable of undergoing. The case is the same with that which Hugh\r\nMiller so strongly puts in relation to the species of algæ that occur\r\nat different distances below high water mark on the coast of Scotland,\r\neach species there attaining a certain limit, and then, instead of\r\nchanging to suit the new conditions, giving place to another. So it is\r\non Mount Washington; and this, whether we regard the lowland plants\r\nthat climb to a certain height, and there stop, the plants that are\r\ncommon to the base and summit, or the plants that are confined to the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nI have already referred to the evident struggle of the spruces and\r\nfirs, and the plants associated with them, to ascend the mountain,\r\nand the same remark applies to all the plants that one after another\r\ncease to appear at various heights from the lower valleys. One by one\r\nthey become stunted and depauperated, and then cease, without any\r\nsemblance of an attempt to vary into new and hardier forms. And this\r\nmust have been proceeding, be it observed, from all those thousands\r\nof years that have elapsed since the elevation of the mountains out\r\nof the glacial seas. It is to be observed, also, that the new plants\r\nthat occur in ascending, often belong to different genera and families\r\nfrom those left behind, not to closely allied species; and in the few\r\ncases in which this last kind of change occurs, there is no graduation\r\ninto intermediate forms. For instance, _Solidago thyrsoidea_ and _S.\r\nvirga-aurea_[198] occur around the base of the mountain, and for some\r\ndistance up its sides. At the height of four to five thousand feet the\r\nlatter only remains, and this in a dwarfish condition. This corresponds\r\nto its distribution elsewhere, for, according to Richardson, it occurs\r\nin lat. 55° to 65° in Arctic America, and according to Hooker, it is\r\nfound in the Rocky Mountains, while it also occurs in the hills of\r\nScotland, and very abundantly in some parts of Norway. In the White\r\nMountains _S. thrysoidea_ prevails toward the base, _S. virga-aurea_\r\ntoward the summit; and at the top of Tuckerman's ravine I found the\r\nformer of these golden rods in blossom, within a few hundred feet of\r\nthe latter, each preserving its distinctive peculiarities. Much has\r\nlately been said of the appearance of specific diversity that results\r\nfrom the breaking up of the continuity of the geographical areas of\r\nplants by geological changes; but here we probably have the converse\r\nof this. The mountain species is no doubt a part of the older Arctic\r\nflora, the other perhaps belong to a more modern flora, and they have\r\nmet on the sides of the White Hills.\r\n\r\n[198] Macoun thinks that most of the specimens referred to this species\r\nbelong to the allied form, _S. Mulllinallata_, Ast, which is very\r\nextensively distributed on the mountains of British America and in the\r\nArctic regions.\r\n\r\nSome hardy species climb from the plains to heights of 5,000 feet\r\nor more, with scarcely even the usual change of being depauperated,\r\nand then suddenly disappear. This is very noteworthy in the case\r\nof two woodland plants, the dwarf cornel or pigeon-berry (_Cornus\r\nCanadensis_), and the twin-flower (_Linnæa borealis_). The former of\r\nthese is a plant most widely distributed over northern America, and\r\nprobably belongs to that newer flora which overspread the continent\r\nafter its re-elevation. In August this plant in the woods around\r\nthe base of Mount Washington is loaded with its red berries. At an\r\nelevation of four to five thousand feet it may be found in bloom; above\r\nthis a few plants appear, destitute of flowers, dwarfish in aspect,\r\nand nipped by cold, and then the species disappears. No doubt the\r\nbirds that feed on its little drupes have carried it up the mountain,\r\nand have sown it a little farther up than the limit of its probable\r\nreproductiveness. The beautiful little _Linnæa_ is a still more widely\r\ndistributed plant; for it occurs on the hills of northern Europe,\r\nand is found across the whole breadth of the American continent from\r\nNova Scotia to the Columbia River. It is almost beyond question a\r\nmember of the old Arctic flora which colonized the islands of the\r\nPleistocene sea, and 'has descended from them on all sides as the land\r\nbecame elevated. This plant also climbs Mount Washington to a height\r\nof 5,000 feet, and presents precisely the same characters on the top\r\nas at the bottom, only losing a little in the length of its stem.\r\nSpecimens bearing blossoms, and quite in the same stage of growth,\r\nmay be collected at the same time on the highest shoulders of Mount\r\nWashington, and on the flats at Gorham. The _Linnæa_ in this is true to\r\nits designation. For, as if it belonged to it to support the reputation\r\nof the great systematist after whom it is named, it preserves its\r\nspecific characters with scarcely a tittle of change throughout all its\r\ngreat range. One cannot see this hardy little survivor of the Glacial\r\nperiod, so unchanging yet so gentle, so modest yet so adventurous,\r\nso wide in its migrations yet so choice in the selection of the mossy\r\nnooks which it adorns with its pendant bells, and renders fragrant with\r\nits delicious perfume, without praying that we might, in these days\r\nof petty distinctions and narrow views, be favoured with more such\r\nminds as that of the great Swede, to combine the little details of the\r\nknowledge of natural history into grand views of the unity of nature.\r\n\r\nAnother plant which, being less dependent on shade and shelter than the\r\n_Linnæa_, mounts still higher, is the cowberry or foxberry (_Vaccinium\r\nvitis-Idæa_). This, also, is both European and American, and is\r\nprobably a survivor of the Pleistocene period. It still occurs in at\r\nleast one locality in the low country of Massachusetts, and on the\r\ncoast of Maine. It is found along the granitic coast of Nova Scotia,\r\nand extends thence northward to the Arctic circle, being found at Great\r\nBear Lake and at Unalaska. This, too, is a most unchanging species,\r\nand the same statement may be made respecting the cloudberry (_Rubus\r\nChamæmorus_), the black crowberry (_Empetrum nigrum_), the Labrador\r\ntea (_Ledum latifolium_), the three-toothed cinquefoil (_Potentilla\r\ntridentata_), which grows on the coast of Nova Scotia, and is found in\r\nthe nodules of the Ottawa clay, the same in every detail as on Mount\r\nWashington, the bog bilberry (_Vaccinium uliginosum_), and the dwarf\r\nbilberry (_V. cæspitosum_). Several of these, too, it will be observed,\r\nare berry-bearing plants, whose seeds must be deposited in all kinds of\r\nlocalities by birds. Yet they never occur in the warm plains, nor do\r\nthey show much tendency to vary in the distant and somewhat dissimilar\r\nplaces in which they occur. In the case of most of these species, the\r\nmost careful comparison of specimens from Mount Washington with those\r\nfrom Labrador, shows no tittle of difference. When we consider the\r\nvast length of time during which such species have existed, and the\r\nmultiplied vicissitudes through which they have passed, one is tempted\r\nto believe that it is the tendency of the \"struggle for existence\" to\r\nconfirm and render permanent the characters of species rather than to\r\nmodify them.\r\n\r\nOf the more specially Arctic plants which have held their ground\r\nunchanged on Mount Washington, the following are some of the principal.\r\n_Diapensia Lapponica_, in beautiful deep green tufts, ascends quite\r\nto the summit. It occurs also in the Adirondack Mountains, on Mount\r\nKatahdin, in Maine, and on the summit of Mount Albert, Gaspé (Macoun).\r\nIt is found in Labrador, and, according to Hooker, extends north to\r\nWhale Island, in the Arctic seas; but it is not found west of the\r\nGreat Fish River. It occurs also on the mountains of Lapland, and\r\nis described as the hardiest plant of that bleak region. _Arenaria_\r\n(_Alsine_) _Grænlandica_, the Greenland sand-wort, adorns with its\r\nclusters of white flowers every sandy crevice in the rocks of the very\r\nsummit of Mount Washington, and is trodden under foot like grass by\r\nthe hundreds of careless sightseers that haunt that peak in summer;\r\nthough I should add, that not a few of them carry off little tufts as\r\na memento of the mountains, along with the fragments of mica which\r\nappear to form the ordinary keepsakes of unscientific visitors. It\r\nis a most frail and delicate plant, seemingly altogether unsuited to\r\nthe dangerous pre-eminence which it seeks, yet it loves the bare,\r\nunsheltered mountain peaks, and when it occurs in the more sheltered\r\nravines, has only its stems a little longer and more slender. It occurs\r\non the Adirondack Mountains and on Katahdin, where, if I may judge from\r\nspecimens kindly sent to me by Prof. Goodale, it attains to smaller\r\ndimensions than on Mount Washington, on the Catskills, and at one place\r\non the sea coast of Maine. I have not seen it in Nova Scotia, but it\r\nranges north to Greenland.\r\n\r\nAnother of the truly Arctic plants is the alpine azalea (_Loiseleuria\r\nprocumbens_), a densely tufted mountain shrub, with hard glossy\r\nleaves, that look as if constructed to brave extremest hardships. It\r\nis found on the mountains of Norway, at the height of 3,550 feet on\r\nthe Scottish hills, according to Watson, and according to Fuchs, at\r\nthe height of 7,000 feet in the milder climate of the Venetian Alps.\r\nIn America it is found in Newfoundland, in Labrador, at 4,000 feet on\r\nMount Albert, Gaspé,[199] and in the barren grounds from lat. 65 to the\r\nextreme Arctic islands. Gray does not mention its occurrence elsewhere\r\nin the United States than the summits of the White Mountains. A member\r\nof the same family of the heaths, the yew-leaved phyllodoce (_P.\r\ntaxifolia_), presents a still more singular distribution. It is found\r\non all the higher mountains of New England and New York, and occurs\r\nalso on the mountains of Scotland and Scandinavia, but its only known\r\nstation in northern America is, according to Hooker, in Labrador. As\r\nmany as nine or ten of the Alpine plants of the White Mountains belong\r\nto the order of the Heaths (Ericaceæ). Another example from this\r\norder is _Rhododendron Lapponicum_, a northern European species, as\r\nits name indicates, and scattered over all the high mountains of New\r\nEngland and New York, occurring also in Labrador, on the Arctic sea\r\ncoasts, and the northern part of the Rocky Mountains, and at 4,000 feet\r\non Mount Albert, Gaspé (Macoun).\r\n\r\n[199] Macoun.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to refer in detail to more of these plants, but I\r\nmust notice two herbaceous species belonging to different families,\r\nbut resembling each other in size and habit the Alpine epilobium (_E.\r\nalpinum_ or _alsinefolium_), and the Alpine speedwell (_Veronica\r\nalpina_). Both are in the United States confined to the highest\r\nmountain tops. Both occur as alpine northern plants in Europe, being\r\nfound on the Alps, on the Scottish Highlands, and in Scandinavia. Both\r\nare found in Labrador and on the Rocky Mountains, and the Veronica\r\nextends as far as Greenland. The Alpine epilobium is one of the few\r\nWhite Mountain plants that have attained the bad eminence of being\r\nregarded as doubtful species. Gray notes as the typical form, that with\r\nobtuse and nearly entire leaves, and as a variety, that with acute and\r\nslightly toothed leaves, which some other botanists seem to regard\r\nas distinct specifically. Thus we find that this little plant has\r\nbeen induced to assume a suspicious degree of variability; yet it is\r\nstrange that both species or varieties are found growing together, as\r\nif the little peculiarities in the form of the leaves were matters of\r\nindifference, and not induced by any dire necessities in the struggle\r\nfor life. Facts of this kind are curious, and not easily explained\r\nunder the supposition either of specific unity or diversity. For why\r\nshould this plant vary without necessity? and why should two species so\r\nmuch alike be created for the same locality? Perhaps these two species\r\nor varieties, wandering from far distant points of origin, have met\r\nhere fortuitously, while the lines of migration have been cut off by\r\ngeological changes; and yet the points of difference are too constant\r\nto be removed, even after the reason for them has disappeared. If this\r\ncould be proved, it would afford a strong reason for believing the\r\nexistence of a real specific diversity in these plants.\r\n\r\nI have said nothing of the grasses and sedges of these mountains; but\r\none of them deserves a special notice. It is the Alpine herd's grass\r\n(_Phleum alpinum_), a humble relation of our common herd's grass. This\r\nplant not only occurs on the White Mountains, in Arctic America, in\r\nthe Canadian Mountains, from the summit of Mount Albert, in Gaspé, to\r\nthe mountains of British Columbia, and on the hills of Scotland and\r\nScandinavia, but has been found on the Mexican Cordillera and at the\r\nStraits of Magellan. The seeds of this grass may perhaps be specially\r\nsuited for transportation by water, as well as by land. It is observed\r\nin Nova Scotia that when the wide flats of mud deposited by the tides\r\nof the Bay of Fundy, are dyked in from the sea, they soon become\r\ncovered with grasses and carices, the seeds of which are supposed to be\r\nwashed down by streams and mingled with the marine silt; and fragments\r\nof grasses abound in the Post-tertiary clays of the Ottawa.\r\n\r\nIt seems almost ridiculous thus to connect the persistence of the\r\nform of a little plant with the subsidence and elevation of whole\r\ncontinents, and the lapse of enormous periods of time. Yet the Power\r\nwhich preserves unchanged from generation to generation the humblest\r\nanimal or plant, is the same with that which causes the permanence\r\nof the great laws of physical nature, and the continued revolutions\r\nof the earth and all its companion spheres. A little leaf, entombed\r\nages on ages ago in the Pleistocene clays of Canada, preserves in all\r\nits minutest features the precise type of that of the same species as\r\nit now lives, after all the prodigious geological changes that have\r\nintervened. An Arctic and Alpine plant that has survived all these\r\nchanges maintains, in its now isolated and far removed stations, all\r\nits specific characters unchanged. The flora of a mountain top is\r\nprecisely what it must have been when it was an island in the glacial\r\nseas. These facts relate not to hard crystalline rocks that remain\r\nunaltered from age to age, but to little delicate organisms that\r\nhave many thousands of times died and been renewed in the lapse of\r\ntime. They show us that what we call a species represents a decision\r\nof the unchanging creative will, and that the group of qualities\r\nwhich constitutes our idea of the species goes on from generation\r\nto generation animating new organisms constructed out of different\r\nparticles of matter. The individual dies, but the species lives, and\r\nwill live until the Power that has decreed its creation shall have\r\ndecreed its extinction; or until, in the slow process of physical\r\nchange depending on another section of His laws, it shall have been\r\nexcluded from the possibility of existence anywhere on the surface of\r\nthe earth, unless we suppose with modern evolutionists that there is\r\na possibility of these plants so changing their characters that in the\r\nlapse of ages they might appear to us to be distinct specific types.\r\nThe fact, however, that the Arctic species have migrated around the\r\nwhole Arctic circle, and have advanced southward and retreated to the\r\nnorth, again and again, without changing their constitutions or forms,\r\naugurs for them at least a remarkable fixity as well as continuity.\r\n\r\nWhile the huge ribs of mother earth that project into mountain summits,\r\nand the grand and majestic movement of the creative processes by which\r\nthey have been formed, speak to us of the majesty of Him to whom the\r\nsea belongs, and whose hand formed the dry land, the continuance of\r\nthese little plants preaches the same lessons of humble faith in the\r\nDivine promises and laws, which our Lord drew from the lilies of the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nIt is suggestive, in connection with the antiquity and migrations of\r\nthese plants, to consider the differences in this respect of some\r\nclosely allied species of the same genera. Of the blueberries that\r\ngrow on the White Mountains, one species, _Vaccinium uliginosum_,\r\nis found in Behring's Straits and very widely in Arctic and boreal\r\nAmerica,[200] also in northern Europe. _V. cæspitosum_ has a wide\r\nnorthern range in America, but is not European. _V. Pennsylvanicum_ and\r\n_V. Canadense_, from their geographical distribution, do not seem to\r\nbelong to the Arctic flora at all, but to be of more southern origin.\r\nThe two bearberries (_Arctostaphylos uva-ursi_ and _alpina_) occur\r\ntogether on the White Hills, and on the Scottish and Scandinavian\r\nmountains; but the former is a plant of much wider and more southern\r\ndistribution in America than the latter. Two of the dwarf willows of\r\nthe White Mountains (_Salix repens_ and _S. herbacea_) are European as\r\nwell as American, but _S. uva-ursi_ seems to be confined to America.\r\n_Rubus triflorus_, the dwarf raspberry, and _R. chamæmorus_, the cloud\r\nberry, climb about equally high on Mount Washington; but the former\r\nis exclusively American, and ranges pretty far southward, while the\r\nlatter extends no farther south than the northern coast of Maine,\r\nand is distributed all around the Arctic regions of the Old and New\r\nWorlds. It is to be observed, however, that the former can thrive on\r\nrich and calcareous soils, while the latter loves those that are barren\r\nand granitic; but it is nevertheless probable that _R. triflorus_\r\nbelongs to a later and more local flora. Similar reasons would induce\r\nthe belief that the American dwarf cornel or pigeon-berry (_Cornus\r\nCanadensis_), whose distribution is solely American, and not properly\r\nArctic, is of later origin than the _C. Suecica_,[201] which occurs in\r\nnorthern America locally, and is extensively distributed in northern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n[200] Macoun, Catalogue of Canadian plants.\r\n\r\n[201] I have found _C. Suecica_ growing along with _C. Canadensis_ in\r\nshaded and northern exposures on the south side of the St. Lawrence,\r\nnear Caconna and Metis. Its seeds may have been brought over from\r\nLabrador by migratory birds.\r\n\r\nI can but glance at such points as these; but they raise great\r\nquestions which are to be worked out, not merely by the patient\r\ncollection of facts, but by a style of scientific thought very much\r\nabove those which, on the one hand, escape such problems by the\r\nsupposition of multiplied centres of creation, or on the other,\r\nrender their solution worthless by confounding races due to external\r\ndisturbing causes with species originally distinct. Difficulties of\r\nvarious kinds are easily evaded by either of these extreme views; but\r\nwith the fact before him of specific diversity and its manifestly long\r\ncontinuance, on the one hand, and the remarkable migrations of some\r\nspecies on the other, the true naturalist must be content to work out\r\nthe problems presented to him with the data afforded by the actual\r\nobservation of nature, following carefully the threads of guidance\r\nthus indicated, not rudely breaking them by too hasty generalizations.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to leave the scientific teachings of our little Alpine\r\nfriends, and to inquire if they can teach anything to the heart as well\r\nas to the head.\r\n\r\nThe mountains themselves, heaving their huge sides to the heavens,\r\nspeak of forces in comparison with which all human power is nothing;\r\nand we can scarcely look upon them in their majesty without a psalm\r\nof praise rising up within us to Him who made the sea, and from whose\r\nhands the dry land took its form. As we ascend them, and as our vision\r\nranges more and more widely over the tops of wooded hills, along the\r\ncourses of streams, over cultivated valleys, and to the shores of the\r\nblue sea itself, our mental vision widens too. We think that the great\r\nroots of these hills run beneath a whole continent, that their tops\r\nlook down on the wide St. Lawrence plain, on the beautiful valleys of\r\nNew England, and on the rice fields of the sunny south. We are reminded\r\nof the brotherhood of man, which overleaps all artificial boundaries,\r\nand should cause us to pray that throughout their whole extent these\r\nhills may rise amidst a happy, a free, and a God-fearing people.\r\n\r\nOur Alpine plants have still higher lessons to teach. They are fitting\r\nemblems of that little flock, scattered everywhere, yet one in heart,\r\nand in all lands having their true citizenship in heaven. They tell us\r\nthat it is the humble who are nearest God, and they ask why we should\r\ndoubt the guardian care of the Father who cares for them. They witness,\r\ntoo, of the lowly and hidden ones who may inhabit the barren and lowly\r\nspots of earth, yet are special subjects of God's love, as they should\r\nbe of ours. We may thus read in the Alpine plants truths that beget\r\ndeeper faith in God, and closer brotherhood with His people.\r\n\r\nThe history of these plants has also a strange significance. It might\r\nhave been written of them, \"Though the dry land be removed out of its\r\nplace, and the mountains cast into the midst of the sea, yet the Lord\r\nwill not forsake the work of His hands\"; for this has been literally\r\ntheir history. In this they hold forth an omen of hope to the people of\r\nGod in that once happy land through which these hills extend, and who\r\nnow mourn the evil times on which they have fallen. The mountain plants\r\nmay teach them that though the floods of strife should rise even to the\r\ntops of the hills, and leave but scattered islets to mark the place of\r\na united land, their rock is sure, and their prayers will prevail.[202]\r\nThe power that has waked the storm is after all their Father's hand.\r\nFor years a cry has risen high above these hills: the cry of the\r\nbondman who has reaped the fields and received no hire. That cry is\r\nsure to be heard in heaven, whatever other prayers may go unanswered.\r\nAn apostle tells us that it enters directly into the ears of the God\r\nof Sabaoth, and is potent to call down the day of slaughter on the\r\nproud ones of earth. The prayer of the slave has been answered; and the\r\ntempest is abroad, sweeping away his oppressors and their abettors. Yet\r\nGod rules in all this, and those whom He has chosen will be spared,\r\neven like the hardy plants of the hill tops, to look again on a renewed\r\nand smiling land, from which many monsters and shapes of dread have for\r\never passed away.\r\n\r\n[202] This paper was originally written at the time when the American\r\nCivil War was raging.\r\n\r\nBut last of all, the Alpine flowers have a lesson that should come\r\nnear to all of us individually. They tell us how well natural law is\r\nobserved, as compared with moral. Obeying with unchanging fidelity the\r\nlaw of their creation, they have meekly borne the cold and storms of\r\nthousands of winters, yet have thankfully expanded their bosoms to the\r\nreturning sun of every summer, and have not once forgot to open their\r\ntiny buds, and bring forth flowers and fruit, doing thus their little\r\npart to the glory of their Maker and ours. How would the moral wastes\r\nof earth rejoice and be glad, did the sunshine of God's daily favours\r\nevoke a similar response from every human heart!\r\n\r\n  References:--Paper on Destruction and Renewal of Forests in North\r\n    America, _Edinburgh Philosophical Journal_, 1847-8.

We may well have doubts as to an\r\naffirmative answer if we do not consider that the means were perfect,\r\neach in its own time, and that man, the final link in the chain of\r\nlife, is that which alone takes hold of the unseen and eternal. He\r\nalone can comprehend the great plan, and appreciate its reason and\r\ndesign. Without his agency in this respect nature would have been a\r\nriddle without any solution--a column without a capital, a tree without\r\nfruit. Besides this, even science may be able to perceive that man may\r\nbe not merely the legatee of all the ages that lie behind, but the\r\nheir of the eternity that lies before, the only earthly being that has\r\nimplanted in him the germ and instinct of immortality.\r\n\r\nWhatever view we may take of these questions, it is of interest to us\r\nto know, if possible, how and when this chief corner stone was placed\r\nupon the edifice of nature, and what are the precise relations of\r\nman to the later geological ages, as well as to the present order of\r\nnature, of which he is at once a part, and its ruler and head. Let us\r\nput this first in the form of a narrative based on geological facts\r\nonly, and then consider some of its details and relations to history.\r\n\r\nThe Glacial age had passed away. The lower land, in great part a bare\r\nexpanse of mud, sand, and gravel, had risen from the icy ocean in\r\nwhich it had been submerged, and most of the mountain tops had lost\r\ntheir covering of perennial snow and ice. The climate was ameliorated,\r\nand the sun again shone warmly on the desolate earth. Gradually the\r\nnew land became overspread with a rich vegetation, and was occupied\r\nby many large animals. There were species of elephant, rhinoceros,\r\nhippopotamus, horse, bison, ox and deer, multiplying till the plains\r\nand river valleys were filled with their herds, in spite of the fact\r\nthat they were followed by formidable carnivorous beasts fitted to prey\r\non them. At this time, somewhere in the warm temperate zone, in an\r\noasis or island of fertility, appeared a new thing on the earth, a man\r\nand woman walking erect in the forest glades, bathing in the waters,\r\ngathering and tasting every edible fruit, watching with curious and\r\ninquiring eyes the various animals around them, and giving them names\r\nwhich might eventually serve not merely to designate their kinds, but\r\nto express actions and emotions as well. When, where, and how did this\r\nnew departure, fraught with so many possibilities, occur--introducing\r\nas it did the dexterous fingers and inventive mind of Man upon the\r\nscene? The last of these questions science is still unable to answer,\r\nand though we may frame many hypotheses, they all remain destitute of\r\ncertain proof in so far as natural science is concerned. We can here\r\nonly fall back on the old traditional and historical monuments of\r\nour race, and believe that man, the child of God, and with God-like\r\nintellect, will, and consciousness, was placed by his Maker in an\r\nEdenic region, and commissioned to multiply and replenish the earth.\r\nThe when and where of his introduction, and his early history when\r\nintroduced, are more open to scientific investigation.\r\n\r\nThat man was originally frugivorous, his whole structure testifies.\r\nThat he originated in some favourable climate and fertile land is\r\nequally certain, and that his surroundings must have been of such a\r\nnature as to give him immunity from the attacks of formidable beasts\r\nof prey, also goes without saying. These are all necessary conditions\r\nof the successful introduction of such a creature as man, and theories\r\nwhich suppose him to have originated in a cold climate, to struggle at\r\nonce with the difficulties and dangers of such a position, are, from a\r\nscientific point of view, incredible.\r\n\r\nBut man was introduced into a wide and varied world, more wide and\r\nvaried than that possessed by his modern descendants. The earliest\r\nmen that we certainly know inhabited out continents in the second\r\nContinental age of the Kainozoic Period, when, as we know from ample\r\ngeological evidence, the land of the northern hemisphere was much more\r\nextensive than at present, with a mild climate, and a rich flora and\r\nfauna. If he was ambitious to leave the oasis of his origin the way\r\nwas open to him, but at the expense of becoming a toiler, an inventor,\r\nand a feeder on animal food, more especially when he should penetrate\r\ninto the colder climates. The details of all this, as they actually\r\noccurred, are not within the range of scientific investigation, for\r\nthese early men must have left few, if any, monuments; but we can\r\nimagine some of them. Man's hands were capable of other uses than the\r\nmere gathering of fruit. His mind was not an instinctive machine, like\r\nthat of lower animals, but an imaginative and inventive intellect,\r\ncapable of adapting objects to new uses peculiar to himself. A fallen\r\nbranch would enable him to obtain the fruits that hung higher than his\r\nhands could reach, a pebble would enable him to break a nut too hard\r\nfor his teeth. He could easily weave a few twigs into a rough basket to\r\ncarry the fruit he had gathered to the cave or shelter, or spreading\r\ntree, or rough hut that served him for a home; and when he had found\r\ncourage to snatch a brand from some tree, ignited by lightning, or by\r\nthe friction of dry branches, and to kindle a fire for himself, he\r\nhad fairly entered on that path of invention and discovery which has\r\nenabled him to achieve so many conquests over nature.\r\n\r\nOur imagination may carry us yet a little farther with reference to his\r\nfortunes. If he needed any weapon to repel aggressive enemies, a stick\r\nor club would serve his purpose, or perhaps a stone thrown from his\r\nhand. Soon, however, he might learn from the pain caused by the sharp\r\nflints that lay in his path the cutting power of an edge, and, armed\r\nwith a flint chip held in the hand, or fitted into a piece of wood, he\r\nwould become an artificer of many things useful and pleasing. As he\r\nwandered into more severe climates, where vegetable food could not be\r\nobtained throughout the year, and as he observed the habits of beasts\r\nand birds of prey, he would learn to be a hunter and a fisherman,\r\nand to cook animal food; and with this would come new habits, wants\r\nand materials, as well as a more active and energetic mode of life.\r\nHe would also have to make new weapons and implements, axes, darts,\r\nharpoons, and scrapers for skins, and bodkins or needles to make skin\r\ngarments. He would use chipped flint where this could be procured, and\r\nfailing this, splintered and rubbed slate, and for some uses, bone and\r\nantler. Much ingenuity would be used in shaping these materials, and\r\nin the working of bone, antler and wood, ornament would begin to be\r\nstudied. In the meantime the hunter, though his weapons improved, would\r\nbecome a ruder and more migratory man, and in anger, or in the desire\r\nto gain some coveted object, might begin to use his weapons against his\r\nbrother man. In some more favoured localities, however, he might attain\r\nto a more settled life; and he, or more likely the woman his helpmate,\r\nmight contrive to tame some species of animals, and to begin some\r\nculture of the soil.\r\n\r\nIt was probably in this early time that metals first attracted the\r\nattention of men. The ages of stone, bronze, and iron believed in by\r\nsome archæologists, are more or less mythical to the geologist, who\r\nknows that these things depend more on locality and on natural products\r\nthan on stages of culture. The analogy of America teaches us that the\r\nuse of different metals may be contemporaneous, provided that they can\r\nbe obtained in a native state. At the time of the discovery of America\r\nthe Esquimaux were using native iron, which, though rare in most parts\r\nof the world, is not uncommon in some rocks of Greenland. The people of\r\nthe region of the great lakes, and of the valleys of the Mississippi\r\nand Ohio, were using native copper from Lake Superior for similar\r\npurposes. Gold was apparently the only metal among the natives of\r\nCentral America. The people of Peru had invented bronze, or had brought\r\nthe knowledge of it with them from beyond the sea. Thus the Peruvians\r\nwere in the bronze age, the Mexicans and Mound builders in the copper\r\nage, and the Esquimaux in the iron age, while at the same time the\r\ngreater part of the aboriginal tribes were at one and the same time\r\nin the ages of chipped and polished stone and in these ages what have\r\nbeen called palæolithic and neolothic weapons were contemporaneous,\r\nthe former being most usually unfinished examples of the latter, or\r\nextemporized tools roughly made in emergencies.[203] How long this\r\nhad lasted, or how long it would have continued, had not Europeans\r\nintroduced from abroad an iron age, we do not know. It was probably\r\nthe same in other parts of the world, in pre-historic times. In any\r\ncase, the discovery of native metals must have occurred very early.\r\nMen searching in the beds of streams for suitable pebbles to form\r\nhammers and other implements, would find nuggets of gold and copper,\r\nand the properties of these, so different from those of other pebbles,\r\nwould at once attract attention, and lead to useful applications.\r\nNative iron is of rarer occurrence, but in certain localities would\r\nalso be found.[204] It must have been experiments on these ores,\r\nwhich resemble the native metals in colour, lustre and weight, that\r\nled to the first attempts at smelting metals, and these must have\r\noccurred at a very early period. Yet for ages the metals must have\r\nbeen extremely scarce, and we know that in comparatively modern times\r\ncivilized nations like the Egyptians were using flint flakes after they\r\nhad domesticated many animals, had become skilful agriculturists and\r\nartisans, and had executed great architectural works.\r\n\r\n[203] \"Fossil Men,\" by the Author. W. H. Holmes, \"American\r\nAnthropologist,\" 1890.\r\n\r\n[204] The rarity of native iron, whether meteoric or telluric, and\r\nits rapid decay by rusting, sufficiently account for its absence in\r\ndeposits where implements of stone and bone have been preserved.\r\n\r\nProbably all these ends had been to some extent, and in some\r\nlocalities, attained in the earliest human period, when man was\r\ncontemporary with many large animals now extinct. But a serious change\r\nwas to occur in human prospects. There is the best geological evidence\r\nthat in the northern hemisphere the mild climate of the earlier\r\nPost-glacial period relapsed into comparative coldness, though not so\r\nextreme as that of the preceding Glacial age. Hill tops, long denuded\r\nof the snow and ice of the Glacial period, were again covered, and cold\r\nwinters sealed up the lakes and rivers, and covered the ground with\r\nwintry snows of long continuance, and with this came a change in animal\r\nlife and in human habits. The old southern elephant (_E. antiquus_),\r\nthe southern rhinoceros (_E. leptorhinus_), and the river hippopotamus\r\n(_H. major_), which had been contemporaries, in Europe at least,\r\nof primitive man, retired from the advancing cold, and ultimately\r\nperished, while their places were taken by the hairy mammoth (_E.\r\nprimigenius_), the woolly rhinoceros (_R. tichorhinus_), the reindeer,\r\nand even the musk ox. Now began a fierce struggle for existence in\r\nthe more northern districts inhabited by man a struggle in which only\r\nthe hardier and ruder races could survive, except, perhaps, in some\r\nof the more genial portions of the warm temperate zone. Men had to\r\nbecome almost wholly carnivorous, and had to contend with powerful and\r\nfierce animals. Tribe contended with tribe for the possession of the\r\nmost productive and sheltered habitats. Thus the struggle with nature\r\nbecame aggravated by that between man and man. Violence disturbed the\r\nprogress of civilization, and favoured the increase and power of the\r\nrudest tribes, while the more delicately organized and finer types of\r\nhumanity, if they continued to exist in some favoured spots, were in\r\nconstant danger of being exterminated by their fiercer and stronger\r\ncontemporaries.\r\n\r\nIn mercy to humanity, this state of things was terminated by a great\r\nphysical revolution, the last great subsidence of the continents--that\r\nPost-glacial flood, which must have swept away the greater part of men,\r\nand many species of great beasts, and left only a few survivors to\r\nre-people the world, just as the mammoth and other gigantic animals had\r\nto give place to smaller and feebler creatures. In these vicissitudes\r\nit seemed determined, with reference to man, that the more gigantic and\r\nformidable races should perish, and that one of the finer types should\r\nsurvive to re-people the world.\r\n\r\nThe age of which we have been writing the history, is that which has\r\nbeen fitly named the Anthropic, in that earlier part of it preceding\r\nthe great diluvial catastrophe, which has fixed itself in all the\r\nearlier traditions of men, and which separates what may be called the\r\nPalanthropic or Antediluvian age from the Neanthropic or Postdiluvian.\r\nIndependently altogether of human history, these are two geological\r\nages distinguished by different physical conditions and different\r\nspecies of animals; and the time has undoubtedly come when all the\r\nspeculations of archæologists respecting early man must be regulated\r\nby these great geological facts, which are stamped upon those later\r\ndeposits of the crust of the earth, which have been laid down since man\r\nwas its inhabitant. If they have only recently assumed their proper\r\nplace in the geological chronology, this is due to the great difficulty\r\nin the case of the more recent deposits in establishing their actual\r\nsuccession and relations to each other. These difficulties have,\r\nhowever, been overcome, and new facts are constantly being obtained\r\nto render our knowledge more definite. Lest, however, the preceding\r\nsketch of the Palanthropic age--that in which gigantic men were\r\ncontemporaries of a gigantic fauna now extinct--should be regarded as\r\naltogether fanciful, we may proceed to consider the geological facts\r\nand classification as actually ascertained.\r\n\r\nThe Tertiary or Kainozoic period, the last of the four great \"times\"\r\ninto which the earth's geological history is usually divided, and\r\nthat to which man and the mammalia belong, was ingeniously subdivided\r\nby Lyell, on the ground of percentages of marine shells and other\r\ninvertebrates of the sea. According to this method, which with some\r\nmodification in details is still accepted, the _Eocene_, or dawn of the\r\nrecent, includes those formations in which the percentage of modern\r\nspecies of marine animals does not exceed 3-1/2, all the other species\r\nfound being extinct. The _Miocene_ (less recent) includes formations\r\nin which the percentage of living species does not exceed 35, and the\r\n_Pliocene_ (more recent) contains formations having more than 35 per\r\ncent, of recent species. To these three may be added the _Pleistocene_,\r\nin which the great majority of the species are recent, and the _Modern_\r\nor Anthropic, in which we are still living. Dawkins and Gaudry give\r\nus a division substantially the same with Lyell's, except that they\r\nprefer to take the evidence of the higher animals instead of the marine\r\nshells. The Eocene thus includes those formations in which there are\r\nremains of mammals or ordinary land quadrupeds, but none of these\r\nbelong to recent species or genera, though they may be included in\r\nthe same families and orders with the recent mammals. This is a most\r\nimportant fact, as we shall see, and the only exception to it is that\r\nGaudry and others hold that a few living genera, as those of the dog,\r\ncivet, and marten, are actually found in the later Eocene. The Miocene,\r\non the same mammalian evidence, will include formations in which there\r\nare living genera of mammals, but no species which survive to the\r\npresent time. The Pliocene and Pleistocene show living species, though\r\nin the former these are very few and exceptional, while in the latter\r\nthey become the majority.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the geological antiquity of man, no geologist expects\r\nto find any human remains in beds older than the Tertiary, because\r\nin the older periods the conditions of the world do not seem to have\r\nbeen suitable to man, and because in these periods no animals nearly\r\nakin to man are known. On entering into the Eocene Tertiary we fail\r\nin like manner to find any human remains; and we do not expect to\r\nfind any, because no living species and scarcely any living genera\r\nof mammals are known in the Eocene; nor do we find in it remains of\r\nany of the animals, as the anthropoid apes, for instance, most nearly\r\nallied to man. In the Miocene the case is somewhat different. Here we\r\nhave living genera at least, and we have large species of apes; but\r\nno remains of man have been discovered, if we except some splinters\r\nof flint found in beds of this age at Thenay, in France, and some\r\nnotched bones. Supposing these objects to have been chipped or notched\r\nby animals, which is by no means certain in the case of the flints,\r\nthe question remains, Was this done by man? Gaudry and Dawkins prefer\r\nto suppose that the artificer was one of the anthropoid apes of the\r\nperiod. It is true that no apes are known to do such work now; but then\r\nother animals, as beavers and birds, are artificers, and some extinct\r\nanimals were of higher powers than their modern representatives. But\r\nif there were Miocene apes which chipped flints and cut bones, this\r\nwould, either on the hypothesis of evolution or that of creation by\r\nlaw, render the occurrence of man still less likely than if there were\r\nno such apes. The scratched and notched bones, on the other hand,\r\nindicate merely the gnawing of sharks or other carnivorous animals. For\r\nthese reasons neither Dawkins nor Gaudry, nor indeed any geologists of\r\nauthority in the Tertiary fauna, believe in Miocene man.\r\n\r\nIn the Pliocene, though the facies of the mammalian fauna of Europe\r\nbecomes more modern, and a few modern species occur, the climate\r\nbecomes colder, and in consequence the apes disappear, so that the\r\nchances of finding fossil men are lessened rather than increased in\r\nso far as the temperate regions are concerned. In Italy, however,\r\nCapellini has described a skull, an implement, and a notched bone\r\nsupposed to have come from Pliocene beds. To this it may be objected\r\nthat the skull--which I examined in 1883 in the museum at Florence--and\r\nthe implement are of recent type, and probably mixed with the Pliocene\r\nstuff by some slip of the ground. As the writer has elsewhere\r\npointed out,[205] similar and apparently fatal objections apply to\r\nthe skull and implements alleged to have been found in Pliocene\r\ngravels in California. Dawkins further informs us that in the Italian\r\nPliocene beds supposed to hold remains of man, of twenty-one mammalia\r\nwhose bones occur, all are extinct species, except possibly one, a\r\nhippopotamus. This, of course, renders very unlikely in a geological\r\npoint of view the occurrence of human remains in these beds.\r\n\r\n[205] \"Fossil Men,\" 1880.\r\n\r\nIn the Pleistocene deposits of Europe--and this applies also to\r\nAmerica--we for the first time find a predominance of recent species\r\nof land animals. Here, therefore, we may look with some hope for\r\nremains of man and his works, and here, in the later Pleistocene, or\r\nthe early Modern, they are actually found. When we speak, however, of\r\nPleistocene man, there arise some questions as to the classification of\r\nthe deposits, which it seems to the writer Dawkins and other British\r\ngeologists have not answered in accordance with geological facts, and\r\na misunderstanding as to which may lead to serious error. They have\r\nextended the term Pleistocene over that Post-glacial period in which\r\nwe find remains of man, and thus have split the \"Anthropic\" period\r\ninto two; and they proceed to divide the latter part of it into the\r\nPre-historic and Historic periods, whereas the name Pleistocene should\r\nnot be extended to the Post-glacial age. The close of the Glacial\r\nperiod, introducing great physical and climatal changes, some new\r\nspecies of mammalia and man himself, should be regarded as the end of\r\nthe Pleistocene, and the introduction of what some French geologists\r\nhave called the _Anthropic_ period, which I have elsewhere divided\r\ninto Palanthropic, corresponding to the so-called Palæolithic age, and\r\nNeanthropic, corresponding to the later stone and metal ages.[206]\r\nThese may be termed respectively the earlier and later stages of the\r\nModern period as distinguished from the Pleistocene Tertiary.\r\n\r\n[206] \"Modern Science in Bible Lands.\"\r\n\r\nIn point of logical arrangement, and especially of geological\r\nclassification, the division into historic and pre-historic periods\r\nis decidedly objectionable. Even in Europe the historic age of the\r\nsouth is altogether a different thing from that of the north, and to\r\nspeak of the pre-historic period in Greece and in Britain or Norway\r\nas indicating the same portion of time is altogether illusory. Hence\r\na large portion of the discussion of this subject has to be properly\r\ncalled \"the overlap of history.\" Further, the mere accident of the\r\npresence or absence of historical documents cannot constitute a\r\ngeological period comparable with such periods as the Pleistocene\r\nand Pliocene, and the assumption of such a criterion of time merely\r\nconfuses our ideas. On the one hand, while the whole Tertiary or\r\nKainozoic, up to the present day, is one great geological period,\r\ncharacterized by a continuous though gradually changing fauna and\r\nseries of physical conditions, and there is consequently no good basis\r\nfor setting apart, as some geologists do, a Quaternary as distinct from\r\nthe Tertiary period; on the other hand, there is a distinct physical\r\nbreak between the Pliocene and the Modern in the great Glacial age.\r\nThis, in its Arctic climate and enormous submergence of the land,\r\nthough it did not exterminate the fauna of the northern hemisphere,\r\ngreatly reduced it, and at the close of this age some new forms came\r\nin. For this reason the division between the Pleistocene and Anthropic\r\nages should be made at the beginning of the Post-glacial age. The\r\nnatural division would thus be:--\r\n\r\nI. Pleistocene, including--\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Early Pleistocene_, or first continental period. Land very\r\nextensive, moderate climate. This passes into the preceding Pliocene.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Later Pleistocene_, or glacial, including Dawkins' \"Mid\r\nPleistocene.\" In this there was a great prevalence of cold and glacial\r\nconditions, and a great submergence of the northern land.\r\n\r\nII. Anthropic, or period of man and modern mammals, including--\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Palanthropic_, _Post-glacial_, or second continental period,\r\nin which the land was again very extensive, and Palæocosmic man was\r\ncontemporary with some great mammals, as the mammoth, now extinct,\r\nand the area of land in the northern hemisphere was greater than at\r\npresent. This includes a later cold period, not equal in intensity\r\nto that of the Glacial period proper, and was terminated by a great\r\nand very general subsidence, accompanied by the disappearance of\r\nPalæocosmic man and some large mammalia, and which may be identical\r\nwith the historical deluge.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Neanthropic_ or _Recent_, when the continents attained their\r\npresent levels, existing races of men colonized Europe, and living\r\nspecies of mammals. This includes both the Pre-historic and Historic\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\nOn geological grounds the above should clearly be our arrangement,\r\nthough of course there need be no objection to such other subdivisions\r\nas historians and antiquarians may find desirable for their purposes.\r\nOn this classification _the earliest certain indications of the\r\npresence of man in Europe, Asia, or America, so far as yet known,\r\nbelong to the Modern or Anthropic period alone_. That man may have\r\nexisted previously no one need deny, but no one can at present\r\npositively affirm on any ground of actual fact. It may be necessary\r\nhere to explain the contentions often made that in Britain and Western\r\nEurope man belongs to an interglacial period. When with Dr. James\r\nGeikie, the great Scottish glacialist, we hold that there were several\r\ninterglacial periods, the Glacial age may be extended by including the\r\nwarm period of the Palanthropic, and the cold at its termination, as\r\none of the interglacial and Glacial periods. In this way, as a matter\r\nof classification, man appears in the latest Interglacial periods.\r\nThis, however, as above stated, I regard as an error in arrangement;\r\nbut it makes no practical difference as to the facts.\r\n\r\nInasmuch, however, as the human remains of the Post-glacial epoch are\r\nthose of fully developed men of high type, it may be said, and has\r\noften been said, that man in some lower stage of development _must_\r\nhave existed at a far earlier period. That is, he must, if certain\r\ntheories as to his evolution from lower animals are to be sustained.\r\nThis, however, is not a mode of reasoning in accordance with the\r\nmethods of science. When facts fail to sustain certain theories we are\r\nusually in the habit of saying \"so much the worse for the theories,\"\r\nnot \"so much the worse for the facts,\" or at least we claim the right\r\nto hold our judgment in suspense till some confirmatory facts are\r\nforth-coming.\r\n\r\nWe have now to inquire as to the actual nature of the indications\r\nof man in Europe and Western Asia at the close of the Glacial or\r\nPleistocene period. These are principally such of his tools or weapons\r\nas could escape decay when embedded in river gravels, or in the earth\r\nand stalagmite of caverns or rock shelters, or buried with his bones\r\nin caves of sepulture. Very valuable accessory fossils are the broken\r\nbones of the animals he has used as food. Most valuable, and rarest\r\nof all, are well-preserved human skulls and skeletons. Some doubt may\r\nattach to mere flint flakes, in the absence of other remains; but\r\nthe other indications above referred to are indisputable, and when\r\nproper precautions are taken to notice the succession of beds, and to\r\neliminate the effects of any later disturbance of the deposits, human\r\nfossils become as instructive and indisputable as any others.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole of the facts thus available are put together, we\r\nfind that the earliest men of whom we have osseous remains, and\r\nwho, undoubtedly, inhabited Europe and Western Asia in the second\r\ncontinental period, before the establishment of the present geography,\r\nand before the disappearance of the mammoth and its companions, were\r\nof two races or subraces, agreeing in certain respects, differing in\r\nothers. Both have long or dolichocephalic heads, and seem to have\r\nbeen men of great strength and muscular energy, with somewhat coarse\r\ncountenances of Mongolian type, and they seem to have been of roving\r\nhabits, living as hunters and fishermen in a semi-barbarous condition,\r\nbut showing some artistic skill and taste in their carvings on bone and\r\nother ornaments.\r\n\r\nThe earliest of the two races locally, though, on the whole, they\r\nwere contemporaneous, is that known as the Cannstadt or Neanderthal\r\npeople, who are characterized by a low forehead, with beetling brows,\r\nmassive limb bones and moderate stature. So far as known they were\r\nthe ruder and less artistic of the two races. The other, the Engis or\r\nCromagnon race, was of higher type, with well-formed and capacious\r\nskull, and a countenance which, if somewhat broad, with high cheek\r\nbones, eyes lengthened laterally, and heavy lower jaw, must have been\r\nof somewhat grand and impressive features. These men are of great\r\nstature, some examples being seven feet in height, and with massive\r\nbones, having strong muscular impressions. The Engis skull found in\r\na cave in Belgium, with bones of the mammoth, the skeletons of the\r\nCromagnon cave in the valley of the Vezere, in France, and those of the\r\ncaves of Mentone, in Italy, represent this race. Doubts, it is true,\r\nhave been entertained as to whether the last-mentioned race is really\r\npalanthropic; but the latest facts as to their mode of occurrence and\r\nassociations seem to render this certain. These men were certainly\r\ncontemporaneous with the mammoth, and they disappeared in the cataclysm\r\nwhich closed the earlier anthropic period. Attempts have, however,\r\nbeen made to separate them into groups according to age, within this\r\nperiod;[207] and there can be no doubt that both in France and England\r\nthe lower and older strata of gravels and caves yield ruder and less\r\nperfect implements than the higher. Independently, however, of the fact\r\nthat the very earliest men may have been peaceful gatherers of fruit,\r\nand not hunters or warriors, having need of lethal weapons, such facts\r\nmay rather testify to local improvement in the condition of certain\r\ntribes than to any change of race. Such local improvement would be very\r\nlikely to occur wherever a new locality was taken possession of by a\r\nsmall and wandering tribe, which, in process of time, might increase in\r\nnumbers and in wealth, as well as in means of intercourse with other\r\ntribes. A similar succession would occur when caves, used at first as\r\ntemporary places of rendezvous by savage tribes, became afterwards\r\nplaces of residence, or were acquired by conquest on the part of\r\ntribes a little more advanced, in the manner in which such changes are\r\nconstantly taking place in rude communities.\r\n\r\n[207] Mortillet, \"Pre-historic Men.\"\r\n\r\nYet on facts of this nature have been built extensive generalizations\r\nas to a race of river-drift men, in a low and savage condition,\r\nreplaced, after the lapse of ages, by a people somewhat more advanced\r\nin the arts, and specially addicted to a cavern life; and this\r\nconclusion is extended to Europe and Asia, so that in every case where\r\nrude flint implements exist in river gravels, evidence is supposed to\r\nbe found of the earlier of these races. But no physical break separates\r\nthe two periods; the fauna remained the same; the skulls, so far\r\nas known, present little difference; and even in works of art the\r\ndistinction is invalidated by grave exceptions, which are intensified\r\nby the fact, which the writer has elsewhere illustrated, that in the\r\ncase of the same people their residences in caves, etc., and their\r\nplaces of burial are likely to contain very different objects from\r\nthose which they leave in river gravels.\r\n\r\nIt is admitted that the whole of these Palæocosmic men are racially\r\ndistinct from modern men, though most nearly allied in physical\r\ncharacters to some of the Mongoloid races of the northern regions.\r\nSome of their characters also appear in the native races of America,\r\nand occasional cases occur, when even the characters of the Cannstadt\r\nskull reappear in modern times. The skull of the great Scottish king\r\nRobert Bruce was of this type; and his indomitable energy and governing\r\npower may have been connected with this fact. Attempts have even been\r\nmade[208] to show an intimate connection between the cave men and the\r\nEsquimaux of Greenland and Arctic America, but, as Wilson has well\r\nshown,[209] this is not borne out by their cranial characters, and the\r\nresemblances, such as they are, in arts and implements, are common\r\nto the Esquimaux and many other American tribes. In many respects,\r\nhowever, the arts and mode of life, as well as some of the physical\r\ncharacters of the Palæocosmic men of Europe were near akin to those of\r\nthe ruder native races of America.\r\n\r\n[208] Dawkins, \"Early Man in Britain.\"\r\n\r\n[209] Address to Anthropological section of the American Association,\r\n1882.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most curious examples of this is the cave at\r\nSorde, in the western Pyrenees. On the floor of this cave lay a human\r\nskeleton, covered with fallen blocks of stone. With it were found\r\nforty canine teeth of the bear, and three of the lion, perforated for\r\nsuspension, and several of these teeth are skilfully engraved with\r\nfigures of animals, one bearing the engraved figure of an embroidered\r\nglove. This necklace, no doubt just such a trophy of the chase as\r\nwould now be worn by a red Indian hunter, though more elaborate, must\r\nhave belonged to the owner of the skull, who would appear to have\r\nperished by a fall of rock, or to have had his body covered after death\r\nwith stones. In the deposit near and under these remains were flint\r\nflakes. Above the skull were several feet of refuse, stones, and bones\r\nof the horse, reindeer, etc., and \"Palæolithic\" flint implements, and\r\nabove all were placed the remains of thirty skulls and skeletons with\r\nbeautifully chipped flint implements, some of them as fine as any\r\nof later age. After the burial of these the cave seems to have been\r\nfinally closed with large stones. The French explorers of this cave\r\nrefer the lower and upper skulls to the same race, that of Cromagnon;\r\nbut others consider the upper remains as \"Neolithic,\" though there is\r\nno reason why a man who possessed a necklace of beautifully carved\r\nteeth should not have belonged to a tribe which used well-made stone\r\nimplements, or why the weapons buried with the dead should have been\r\nno better than the chips and flakes left by the same people in their\r\nrubbish heaps. In any case the interment and this applies also to the\r\nMentone caves recalls the habits of American aborigines. In some of\r\nthese cases we have even deposits of red oxide of iron, representing\r\nthe war paint of the ancient hunter.\r\n\r\nWidely different opinions have been held by archæologists as to the\r\nconnection of the Palanthropic and Neanthropic ages. It suits the\r\npresent evolutionist and exaggerated uniformitarianism of our day\r\nto take for granted that the two are continuous, and pass into each\r\nother. But there are stubborn facts against this conclusion. Let us\r\ntake, for example, the area represented by the British Islands and the\r\nneighbouring continent. In the earlier period Britain was a part of the\r\nmainland, and was occupied by the mammoth, the woolly rhinoceros, and\r\nother animals, now locally or wholly extinct. The human inhabitants\r\nwere of a large-bodied and coarse race not now found anywhere. In the\r\nlater period all this is changed. Britain has become an island. Its\r\ngigantic Post-glacial fauna has disappeared. Its human inhabitants are\r\nnow small in stature and delicate in feature, and represented to this\r\nday by parts of the population of the south of Wales and Ireland. They\r\nburied their dead in the peculiar cemeteries known as long barrows, and\r\ntheir implements and weapons are of a new type, previously unknown.\r\nAll this shows a great interval of physical and organic mutation.\r\nIn connection with this we have the high-level gravel and rubble,\r\nwhich Prestwich has shown to belong to this stage, and which proves\r\na subsidence even greater than that to be inferred from the present\r\ndiminution of the land area. Knowing as we do that the close of the\r\nGlacial period was not more than 8,000 years ago, and deducting from\r\nthis the probable duration of the Palanthropic age on the one hand, and\r\nthat of modern history on the other, we must admit that the interval\r\nleft for the great physical and faunal changes above referred to is\r\ntoo small to permit them to have occurred as the result of slow and\r\ngradual operations. Considerations of this kind have indeed some of\r\nthe best authorities on the subject, as Cartailhac, Forel, and de\r\nMortillet, to hold that there is \"an immense space, a great gap,\r\nduring which the fauna was renewed, and after which a new race of men\r\nsuddenly made its appearance, and polished stone instead of chipping\r\nit, and surrounded themselves with domestic animals.\"[210] There is\r\nthus, in the geological history of man an interval of physical and\r\norganic change, corresponding to that traditional and historical deluge\r\nwhich has left its memory with all the more ancient nations. Thus our\r\nmen of the Palanthropic, Post-glacial or Mammoth age are the same\r\nwe have been accustomed to call Antediluvians, and their immediate\r\nsuccessors are identical with the Basques and ancient Iberians, a\r\nnon-Aryan or Turanian people who once possessed nearly the whole of\r\nEurope, and included the rude Ugrians and Laps of the north, the\r\ncivilized Etruscans of the south, and the Iberians of the west, with\r\nallied tribes occupying the British Islands. This race, scattered\r\nand overthrown before the dawn of authentic history in Europe by the\r\nCelts and other intrusive peoples, was unquestionably that which\r\nsucceeded the now extinct Palæocosmic race, and constituted the men\r\nof the so-called \"Neolithic period,\" which thus connects itself with\r\nthe modern history of Europe, from which it is not separated by any\r\nphysical catastrophe like that which divides the older men of the\r\nmammoth age and the widely spread continents of the Post-glacial period\r\nfrom our modern days. This identification of the Neolithic men with\r\nthe Iberians, which the writer has also insisted on, Dawkins deserves\r\ncredit for fully elucidating, and he might have carried it farther,\r\nto the identification of these same Iberians with the Berbers, the\r\nGuanches of the Canary Islands, and the Caribbean and other tribes of\r\neastern and central America. On these hitherto dark subjects light\r\nis now rapidly breaking, and we may hope that much of the present\r\nobscurity will soon be cleared away.\r\n\r\n[210] Quatrefages, \"The Human Species.\" The interval should not,\r\nhowever, be placed after the reindeer period, as this animal occurs in\r\nboth ages.\r\n\r\nSupposing, then, that we may apply the term Anthropic to that portion\r\nof the Kainozoic period which intervenes between the close of the\r\nGlacial age and the present time, and that we admit the division of\r\nthis into two portions, the earlier, called the Palanthropic, and the\r\nlater, which still continues, the Neanthropic, it will follow that one\r\ngreat physical and organic break separates the Palanthropic age from\r\nthe preceding Glacial, and a second similar break separates the two\r\ndivisions of the Anthropic from each other. This being settled, if\r\nwe allow say 2,500 years from the Glacial age for the first peopling\r\nof the world and the Palanthropic age, and if we consider the modern\r\nhistory of the European region and the adjoining parts of Asia and\r\nAfrica to go back for 5,000 years, there will remain a space of from\r\n500 to 1,000 years for the destruction of the Palæocosmic men and the\r\nre-peopling of the old continent by such survivors as founded the\r\nNeocosmic peoples. These later peoples, though distinct racially from\r\ntheir predecessors, may represent a race contemporary with them in some\r\nregions in which it was possible to survive the great cataclysm, so\r\nthat we do not need to ask for time to develop such new race.[211]\r\n\r\n[211] For details of the physical characters of the older races of men\r\nI may refer to the works mentioned below, or to the writings of Dawkins\r\nand Quatrefages.\r\n\r\nWe cannot but feel some regret that the grand old Palæocosmic race was\r\ndestined to be swept away by the flood, but it was no doubt better\r\nfor the world that it should be replaced by a more refined if feebler\r\nrace. When we see how this has, in some of its forms, reverted to the\r\nold type, and emulated, if not surpassed it in filling the earth with\r\nviolence, we may, perhaps, congratulate ourselves on the extinction of\r\nthe giant races of the olden time.\r\n\r\n  References:--\"Fossil Men,\" London, 1880.

Sometimes it is\r\npersonified as a sort of goddess, working her own sweet will with\r\nmaterial things. Sometimes it expresses the forces which act on matter,\r\nand again it stands for material things themselves. It is spoken of as\r\nsubject to law, but just as often natural law is referred to in terms\r\nwhich imply that nature itself is the lawgiver. It is supposed to be\r\nopposed to the equally vague term \"supernatural\"; but this term is used\r\nnot merely to denote things above and beyond nature, if there are such,\r\nbut certain opinions held respecting natural things. On the other hand,\r\nthe natural is contrasted with the artificial, though this is always\r\nthe outcome of natural powers, and is certainly not supernatural.\r\nAgain, it is applied to the inherent properties of beings for which we\r\nare unable to account, and which we are content to say constitute their\r\nnature. We cannot look into the works of any of the more speculative\r\nwriters of the day without meeting with all these uses of the word, and\r\nhave to be constantly on our guard lest by a change of its meaning we\r\nshall be led to assent to some proposition altogether unfounded.\r\n\r\nFor illustrations of this convenient though dangerous ambiguity, I\r\nmay turn at random to almost any page in Darwin's celebrated work on\r\nthe \"Origin of Species.\" In the beginning of Chapter III. he speaks\r\nof animals \"in a state of nature\" that is, not in a domesticated or\r\nartificial condition, so that here nature is opposed to the devices\r\nof man. Then he speaks of species as \"arising in nature,\" that is,\r\nspontaneously produced in the midst of certain external conditions\r\nor environment outside of the organic world. A little farther on he\r\nspeaks of useful varieties as given to man by \"the hand of Nature,\"\r\nwhich here becomes an imaginary person; and it is worthy of notice\r\nthat in this place the printer or proof-reader has given the word an\r\ninitial capital, as if a proper name. In the next section he speaks\r\nof the \"works of Nature\" as superior to those of art. Here the word\r\nis not only opposed to the artificial, but seems to imply some power\r\nabove material things and comparable with or excelling the contriving\r\nintelligence of man. I do not mean by these examples to imply that\r\nDarwin is in this respect more inaccurate than other writers. On the\r\ncontrary, he is greatly surpassed by many of his contemporaries in\r\nthe varied and fantastic uses of this versatile word. An illustration\r\nwhich occurs to me here, as at once amusing and instructive, is an\r\nexpression used by Romanes, one of the cleverest of the followers of\r\nthe great evolutionist, and which appears to him to give a satisfactory\r\nexplanation of the mystery of elevation in nature. He says, \"Nature\r\nselects the best individuals out of each generation to live.\" Here\r\nnature must be an intelligent agent, or the statement is simply\r\nnonsensical. The same alternative applies to much of the use of the\r\nfavourite term \"natural selection.\" In short, those who use such modes\r\nof expression would be more consistent if they were at once to come\r\nback to the definition of Seneca, that nature is \"a certain divine\r\npurpose manifested in the world.\"\r\n\r\nThe derivation of the word gives us the idea of something produced\r\nor becoming, and it is curious that the Greek _physis_, though\r\netymologically distinct, conveys the same meaning--a coincidence which\r\nmay perhaps lead us to a safe and serviceable definition. Nature,\r\nrightly understood, is, in short, an orderly system of things in time\r\nand space, and this not invariable, but in a state of constant movement\r\nand progress, whereby it is always becoming something different\r\nfrom what it was. Now man is placed in the midst of this orderly,\r\nlaw-regulated yet ever progressive system, and is himself a part of\r\nit; and if we can understand his real relations to its other parts, we\r\nshall have made some approximation to a true philosophy. The subject\r\nhas been often discussed, but is perhaps not yet quite exhausted.[212]\r\n\r\n[212] \"Man's Place in Nature,\" _Princeton Review_, November, 1878. \"The\r\nUnity of Nature,\" by the Duke of Argyll, 1884, may be considered as\r\nsuggestive of the thoughts of this chapter.\r\n\r\nRegarding man as a part of nature, we must hold to his entering into\r\nthe grand unity of the natural system, and must not set up imaginary\r\nantagonisms between man and nature as if he were outside of it. An\r\ninstance of this appears in Tyndall's celebrated Belfast address,\r\nwhere he says, in explanation of the errors of certain of the older\r\nphilosophers, that \"the experiences which formed the weft and woof of\r\ntheir theories were chosen not from the study of nature, but from that\r\nwhich lay much nearer to them--the observation of Man\": a statement\r\nthis which would make man a supernatural, or at least a preternatural\r\nbeing. Again, it does not follow, because man is a part of nature,\r\nthat he must be precisely on a level with its other parts. There are\r\nin nature many planes of existence, and man is no doubt on one of its\r\nhigher planes, and possesses distinguishing powers and properties of\r\nhis own. Nature, like a perfect organism, is not all eye or all hand,\r\nbut includes various organs, and so far as we see it in our planet, man\r\nis its head, though we can easily conceive that there may be higher\r\nbeings in other parts of the universe beyond our ken.\r\n\r\nThe view which we may take of man's position relatively to the beings\r\nwhich are nearest to him, namely, the lower animals, will depend on our\r\npoint of sight--whether that of mere anatomy and physiology, or that\r\nof psychology and pneumatology as well. This distinction is the more\r\nimportant, since, under the somewhat delusive term \"biology,\" it has\r\nbeen customary to mix up all these considerations, while, on the other\r\nhand, those anatomists who regard all the functions of organic beings\r\nas merely mechanical and physical, do not scruple to employ this term\r\nbiology for their science, though on their hypothesis there can be no\r\nsuch thing as life, and consequently the use of the word by them must\r\nbe either superstitious or hypocritical.\r\n\r\nAnatomically considered, man is an animal of the class _Mammalia_.\r\nIn that class, notwithstanding the heroic efforts of some modern\r\ndetractors from his dignity to place him with the monkeys in the\r\norder _Primates_, he undoubtedly belongs to a distinct order. I have\r\nelsewhere argued that, if he were an extinct animal, the study of\r\nthe bones of his hand, or of his head, would suffice to convince\r\nany competent palæontologist that he represents a distinct order,\r\nas far apart from the highest apes as they are from the carnivora.\r\nThat he belongs to a distinct family no anatomist denies, and the\r\nsame unanimity of course obtains as to his generic and specific\r\ndistinctness. On the other hand, no zoological systematist now doubts\r\nthat all the races of men are specifically identical. Thus we have the\r\nanatomical position of man firmly fixed in the system of nature, and\r\nhe must be content to acknowledge his kinship not only with the higher\r\nanimals nearest to him, but with the humblest animalcule. With all he\r\nshares a common material and many common features of structure.\r\n\r\nWhen we ascend to the somewhat higher plane of physiology we find in\r\na general way the same relationship to animals. Of the four grand\r\nleading functions of the animal, nutrition, reproduction, voluntary\r\nmotion, and sensation, all are performed by man as by other animals.\r\nHere, however, there are some marked divergences connected with special\r\nanatomical structures, on the one hand, and with his higher endowments\r\non the other. With regard to food, for example, man might be supposed\r\nto be limited by his masticatory and digestive apparatus to succulent\r\nvegetable substances. But by virtue of his inventive faculties he is\r\npractically unlimited, being able by artificial processes to adapt the\r\nwhole range of vegetable and animal food substances to his use. He is\r\nvery poorly furnished with natural tools to aid in procuring food,\r\nas claws, tusks, etc., but by invented implements he can practically\r\nsurpass all other creatures. The long time of helplessness in infancy,\r\nwhile it is necessary for the development of his powers, is a practical\r\ndisadvantage which leads to many social arrangements and contrivances\r\nspecially characteristic of man. Man's sensory powers, while inferior\r\nin range to those of many other animals, are remarkable for balance\r\nand completeness, leading to perceptions of differences in colours,\r\nsounds, etc., which lie at the foundation of art. The specialization\r\nof the hand again connects itself with contrivances which render an\r\nanimal naturally defenceless the most formidable of all, and an animal\r\nnaturally gifted with indifferent locomotive powers able to outstrip\r\nall others in speed and range of locomotion. Thus the physiological\r\nendowments of man, while common to him with other animals, and in\r\nsome respects inferior to theirs, present in combination with his\r\nhigher powers points of difference which lead to the most special and\r\nunexpected results.\r\n\r\nIn his psychical relations, using this term in its narrower sense, we\r\nmay see still greater divergencies from the line of the lower animals.\r\nThese may no doubt be connected with his greater volume of brain; but\r\nrecent researches seem to show that brain has more to do with motory\r\nand sensory powers than with those that are intellectual, and thus,\r\nthat a larger brain is only indirectly connected with higher mental\r\nmanifestations. Even in the lower animals it is clear that the ferocity\r\nof the tiger, the constructive instinct of the beaver, and the sagacity\r\nof the elephant depend on psychical powers which are beyond the reach\r\nof the anatomist's knife, and this is still more markedly the case in\r\nman. Following in part the ingenious analysis of Mivart, we may regard\r\nthe psychical powers of man as reflex, instinctive, emotional, and\r\nintellectual; and in each of these aspects we shall find points of\r\nresemblance to other animals, and of divergence from them. In regard\r\nto reflex actions, or those which are merely automatic, inasmuch\r\nas they are intended to provide for certain important functions\r\nwithout thought or volition, their development is naturally in the\r\ninverse ratio of psychical elevation, and man is consequently, in\r\nthis respect, in no way superior to lower animals. The same may be\r\nsaid with reference to instinctive powers, which provide often for\r\ncomplex actions in a spontaneous and unreasoning manner. In these\r\nalso man is rather deficient than otherwise; and since, from their\r\nnature, they limit their possessors to narrow ranges of activity, and\r\nfix them within a definite scope of experience and efficiency, they\r\nwould be incompatible with those higher and more versatile inventive\r\npowers which man possesses. The comb-building instinct of the bee, the\r\nnest-weaving instinct of the bird, are fixed and invariable things,\r\nobviously incompatible with the varied contrivance of man; and while\r\ninstinct is perfect within its narrow range, it cannot rise beyond this\r\ninto the sphere of unlimited thought and contrivance. Higher than mere\r\ninstinct are the powers of imagination, memory, and association, and\r\nhere man at once steps beyond his animal associates, and develops these\r\nin such a variety of ways, that even the rudest tribes of men, who\r\noften appear to trust more to these endowments than to higher powers,\r\nrise into a plane immeasurably above that of the highest and most\r\nintelligent brutes, and toward which they are unable, except to a very\r\nlimited degree, to raise those of the more domesticable animals which\r\nthey endeavour to train into companionship with themselves. It is,\r\nhowever, in these domesticated animals that we find the highest degree\r\nof approximation to ourselves in emotional development, and this is\r\nperhaps one of the points that fits them for such human association. In\r\napproaching the higher psychical endowments, the affinity of man and\r\nthe brute appears to diminish and at length to cease, and it is left to\r\nhim alone to rise into the domain of the rational and ethical.\r\n\r\nThose supreme endowments of man we may, following the nomenclature of\r\nancient philosophy and of our Sacred Scriptures, call \"pneumatical\" or\r\nspiritual. They consist of consciousness, reason, and moral volition.\r\nThat man possesses these powers every one knows; that they exist or can\r\nbe developed in lower animals no one has succeeded in proving. Here,\r\nat length, we have a severance between man and material nature. Yet it\r\ndoes not divorce him from the unity of nature, except on the principles\r\nof atheism. For if it separates him from animals, it allies him with\r\nthe Power who made and planned the animals. To the naturalist the fact\r\nthat such capacities exist in a being who in his anatomical structure\r\nso closely resembles the lower animals, constitutes an evidence of the\r\nindependent existence of those powers and of their spiritual character\r\nand relation to a higher power which, I think, no metaphysical\r\nreasoning or materialistic scepticism will suffice to invalidate. It\r\nwould be presumption, however, from the standpoint of the naturalist\r\nto discuss at length the powers of man's spiritual being. I may refer\r\nmerely to a few points which illustrate at once his connection with\r\nother creatures, and his superiority to them as a higher member of\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nAnd, first, we may notice those axiomatic beliefs which lie at the\r\nfoundation of human reasoning, and which, while apparently in harmony\r\nwith nature, do not admit of verification except by an experience\r\nimpossible to finite beings. Whether these are ultimate truths, or\r\nmerely results of the constitution bestowed on us, or effects of the\r\ndirect action of the creative mind on ours, they are to us like the\r\ninstincts of animals infallible and unchanging. Yet, just as the\r\ninstincts of animals unfailingly connect them with their surroundings,\r\nour intuitive beliefs fit us for understanding nature and for existing\r\nin it as our environment. These beliefs also serve to connect man with\r\nhis fellow man, and in this aspect we may associate with them those\r\nuniversal ideas of right and wrong, of immortality, and of powers above\r\nourselves, which pervade humanity.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of this spiritual constitution is illustrated by the\r\nways in which man, starting from powers and contrivances common to\r\nhim and animals, develops them into new and higher uses and results.\r\nThis is markedly seen in the gift of speech. Man, like other animals,\r\nhas certain natural utterances expressive of emotions or feelings. He\r\ncan also, like some of them, imitate the sounds produced by animate\r\nor inanimate objects; while the constitution of his brain and vocal\r\norgans gives him special advantages for articulate utterance. But when\r\nhe develops these gifts into a system of speech expressing not mere\r\nsounds occurring in nature, but by association and analogy with these,\r\nproperties and relations of objects and general and abstract ideas,\r\nhe rises into the higher sphere of the spiritual. He thus elevates a\r\npower of utterance common to him with animals to a higher plane, and\r\nconnecting it with his capacity for understanding nature and arriving\r\nat general truths, asserts his kinship to the great creative mind, and\r\nfurnishes a link of connection between the material universe and the\r\nspiritual Creator.\r\n\r\nThe manner of existence of man in nature is as well illustrated by\r\nhis arts and inventions as by anything else; and these serve also\r\nto enlighten us as to the distinction between the natural and the\r\nartificial. Naturalists often represent man as dependent on nature\r\nfor the first hints of his useful arts. There are in animal nature\r\ntailors, weavers, masons, potters, carpenters, miners, and sailors,\r\nindependently of man, and many of the tools, implements, and machines\r\nwhich he is said to have invented were perfected in the structures\r\nof lower animals long before he came into existence. In all these\r\nthings man has been an assiduous learner from nature, though in some of\r\nthem, as for example in the art of aërial navigation, he has striven\r\nin vain to imitate the powers possessed by other animals. But it may\r\nwell be doubted whether man is in this respect so much an imitator as\r\nhas been supposed, and whether the resemblance of his plans to those\r\npreviously realized in nature does not depend on that general fitness\r\nof things which suggests to rational minds similar means to secure\r\nsimilar ends. But in saying this we in effect say that man is not only\r\na part of nature, but that his mind is in harmony with the plans of\r\nnature, or, in other words, with the methods of the creative mind. Man\r\nis also curiously in harmony with external nature in the combination\r\nin his works of the ideas of plan and adaptation, of ornament and\r\nuse. In architecture, for example, devising certain styles or orders,\r\nand these for the most part based on imitations of natural things; he\r\nadapts these to his ends, just as in nature types of structure are\r\nadapted to a great variety of uses, and he strives to combine, as in\r\nnature, perfect adaptation to use with conformity to type or style. So,\r\nin his attempts at ornament he copies natural forms, and uses these\r\nforms to decorate or conceal parts intended to serve essential purposes\r\nin the structure. This is at least the case in the purer styles of\r\nconstruction. It is in the more debased styles that arches, columns,\r\ntriglyphs, or buttresses are placed where they can serve no useful\r\npurpose, and become mere excrescences. But in this case the abnormality\r\nresulting breeds in the beholder an unpleasing mental confusion, and\r\ncauses him, even when he is unable to trace his feelings to their\r\nsource, to be dissatisfied with the result. Thus man is in harmony with\r\nthat arrangement of nature which causes every ornamental part to serve\r\nsome use, and which unites adaptation with plan.\r\n\r\nThe following of nature must also form the basis of those fine arts\r\nwhich are not necessarily connected with any utility, and in man's\r\npursuit of art of this kind we see one of the most recondite and at\r\nfirst sight inexplicable of his correspondences with the other parts\r\nof nature; for there is no other creature that pursues art for its\r\nown sake. Modern archæological discovery has shown that the art of\r\nsculpture began with the oldest known races of man, and that they\r\nsucceeded in producing very accurate imitations of natural objects.\r\nBut from this primitive starting-point two ways diverge. One leads to\r\nthe conventional and the grotesque, and this course has been followed\r\nby many semi-civilized nations. Another leads to accurate imitation of\r\nnature, along with new combinations arising from the play of intellect\r\nand imagination. Let us look for a moment at the actual result of the\r\ndevelopment of these diverse styles of art, and at their effect on the\r\nculture of humanity as existing in nature. We may imagine a people who\r\nhave wholly discarded nature in their art, and have devoted themselves\r\nto the monstrous and the grotesque. Such a people, so far as art is\r\nconcerned, separates itself widely from nature and from the mind of the\r\nCreator, and its taste and possibly its morals sink to the level of the\r\nmonsters it produces. Again, we may imagine a people in all respects\r\nfollowing nature in a literal and servile manner. Such a people would\r\nprobably attain to but a very moderate amount of culture, but having a\r\ngood foundation, it might ultimately build up higher things. Lastly,\r\nwe may fancy a people who, like the old Greeks, strove to add to the\r\ncopying of nature a higher and ideal beauty by combining in one the\r\nbest features of many natural objects, or devising new combinations\r\nnot found in nature itself. In the first of these conditions of art\r\nwe have a falling away from or caricaturing of the beauty of nature.\r\nIn the second we have merely a pupilage to nature. In the third we\r\nfind man aiming to be himself a creator, but basing his creations on\r\nwhat nature has given him. Thus all art worthy of the name is really a\r\ndevelopment of nature. It is true the eccentricities of art and fashion\r\nare so erratic that they may often seem to have no law. Yet they are\r\nall under the rule of nature; and hence even uninstructed common\r\nsense, unless dulled by long familiarity, detects in some degree their\r\nincongruity, and though it may be amused for a time, at length becomes\r\nwearied with the mental irritation and nervous disquiet which they\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nI may be permitted to add that all this applies with still greater\r\nforce to systems of science and philosophy. Ultimately these must be\r\nall tested by the verities of nature to which man necessarily submits\r\nhis intellect, and he who builds for aye must build on the solid ground\r\nof nature. The natural environment presents itself in this connection\r\nas an educator of man. From the moment when infancy begins to exercise\r\nits senses on the objects around, this education begins training the\r\npowers of observation and comparison, cultivating the conception of\r\nthe grand and beautiful, leading to analysis and abstract and general\r\nideas. Left to itself, it is true this natural education extends but\r\na little way, and ordinarily it becomes obscured or crushed by the\r\ndemands of a hard utility, or by an artificial literary culture, or by\r\nthe habitude of monstrosity and unfitness in art. Yet, when rightly\r\ndirected, it is capable of becoming an instrument of the highest\r\nculture, intellectual, æsthetic, and even moral. A rational system of\r\neducation would follow nature in the education of the young, and drop\r\nmuch that is arbitrary and artificial. Here I would merely remark,\r\nthat when we find that the accurate and systematic study of nature\r\ntrains most effectually some of the more practical powers of mind, and\r\nleads to the highest development of taste for beauty in art, we see in\r\nthis relation the unity of man and nature, and the unity of both with\r\nsomething higher than either.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, occur to us here, that when we consider man as an\r\nimprover and innovator in the world, there is much that suggests a\r\ncontrariety between him and nature, and that, instead of being the\r\npupil of his environment, he becomes its tyrant. In this aspect man,\r\nand especially civilized man, appears as the enemy of wild nature, so\r\nthat in those districts which he has most fully subdued, many animals\r\nand plants have been exterminated, and nearly the whole surface has\r\ncome under his processes of culture, and has lost the characteristics\r\nwhich belonged to it in its primitive state. Nay more, we find that by\r\ncertain kinds of so called culture man tends to exhaust and impoverish\r\nthe soil, so that it ceases to minister to his comfortable support, and\r\nbecomes a desert. Vast regions of the earth are in this impoverished\r\ncondition, and the westward march of exhaustion warns us that the time\r\nmay come when even in comparatively new countries, like America, the\r\nland will cease to be able to sustain its inhabitants. Behind this\r\nstands a still farther and portentous possibility. The resources of\r\nchemistry are now being taxed to the utmost to discover methods by\r\nwhich the materials of human food may be produced synthetically, and we\r\nmay possibly, at some future time, find that albumen and starch may be\r\nmanufactured cheaply from their elements by artificial processes. Such\r\na discovery might render man independent of the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms. Agriculture might become an unnecessary and unprofitable\r\nart. A time might come when it would no longer be possible to find on\r\nearth a green field, or a wild animal; and when the whole earth would\r\nbe one great factory, in which toiling millions were producing all the\r\nmaterials of food, clothing, and shelter. Such a world may never exist,\r\nbut its possible existence may be imagined, and its contemplation\r\nbrings vividly before us the vast powers inherent in man as a subverter\r\nof the ordinary course of nature. Yet even this ultimate annulling of\r\nwild nature would be brought about not by anything preternatural in\r\nman, but simply by his placing himself in alliance with certain natural\r\npowers and agencies, and by their means attaining dominion over the\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nHere there rises before us a spectre which science and philosophy\r\nappear afraid to face, and which asks the dread question,--What is the\r\ncause of the apparent abnormality in the relations of man and nature?\r\nIn attempting to solve this question, we must admit that the position\r\nof man, even here, is not without natural analogies. The stronger\r\npreys upon the weaker, the lower form gives place to the higher,\r\nand in the progress of geological time old species have died out in\r\nfavour of newer, and old forms of life have been exterminated by later\r\nsuccessors. Man, as the newest and highest of all, has thus the natural\r\nright to subdue and rule the world. Yet there can be little doubt that\r\nhe uses this right unwisely and cruelly, and these terms themselves\r\nexplain why he does so, because they imply freedom of will. Given a\r\nsystem of nature destitute of any being higher than the instinctive\r\nanimal, and introduce into it a free rational agent, and you have at\r\nonce an element of instability. So long as his free thought and purpose\r\ncontinue in harmony with the arrangements of his environment, so long\r\nall will be harmonious; but the very hypothesis of freedom implies that\r\nhe can act otherwise, and so perfect is the equilibrium of existing\r\nthings, that one wrong or unwise action may unsettle the nice balance,\r\nand set in operation trains of causes and effects producing continued\r\nand ever-increasing disturbance. Thus the most primitive state of man,\r\nthough destitute of all mechanical inventions, may have been better in\r\nrelation to the other parts of nature than any that he has subsequently\r\nattained to. His \"many inventions\" have injured him in his natural\r\nrelations. This \"fall of man\" we know as a matter of observation and\r\nexperience has actually occurred, and it can be retrieved only by\r\ncasting man back again into the circle of merely instinctive action,\r\nor by carrying him forward until, by growth in wisdom and knowledge, he\r\nbecomes fitted to be the lord of creation. The first method has been\r\nproved unsuccessful by the rebound of humanity against all the attempts\r\nto curb and suppress its liberty. The second has been the effort of\r\nall reformers and philanthropists since the world began, and its\r\nimperfect success affords a strong ground for clinging to the theistic\r\nview of nature, for soliciting the intervention of a Power higher than\r\nman, and for hoping for a final restitution of all things through the\r\nintervention of that Power. Mere materialistic evolution must ever and\r\nnecessarily fail to account for the higher nature of man, and also for\r\nhis moral aberrations. These only come rationally into the system of\r\nnature under the supposition of a Higher Intelligence, from whom man\r\nemanates, and whose nature he shares.\r\n\r\nBut on this theistic view we are introduced to a kind of unity and of\r\nevolution for a future age, which is the great topic of revelation, and\r\nis not unknown to science and philosophy, in connection with the law\r\nof progress and development deducible from the geological history, in\r\nwhich an ascending series of lower animals culminates in man himself.\r\nWhy should there not be a new and higher plane of existence to be\r\nattained to by humanity--a new geological period, so to speak, in\r\nwhich present anomalies shall be corrected, and the grand unity of the\r\nuniverse and its harmony with its Maker fully restored. This is what\r\nPaul anticipates when he tells us of a \"pneumatical\" or spiritual body,\r\nto succeed to the present natural or \"psychical\" one, or what Jesus\r\nHimself tells us when He says that in the future state we shall be like\r\nto the angels. Angels are not known to us as objects of scientific\r\nobservation, but such an order of beings is quite conceivable, and\r\nthis not as supernatural, but as part of the order of nature. They are\r\ncreated beings like ourselves, subject to the laws of the universe,\r\nyet free and intelligent and liable to error, in bodily constitution\r\nfreed from many of the limitations imposed on us, mentally having\r\nhigher range and grasp, and consequently masters of natural powers not\r\nunder our control. In short, we have here pictured to us an order of\r\nbeings forming a part of nature, yet in their powers as miraculous to\r\nus as we might be supposed to be to lower animals, could they think of\r\nsuch things. This idea of angels bridges over the great natural gulf\r\nbetween humanity and deity, and illustrates a higher plane than that of\r\nman in his present state, but attainable in the future. Dim perceptions\r\nof this would seem to constitute the substratum of the ideas of the\r\nso-called polytheistic religions. Christianity itself is in this aspect\r\nnot so much a revelation of the supernatural as the highest bond of\r\nthe great unity of nature. It reveals to us the perfect Man, who is\r\nalso one with God, and the mission of this Divine Man to restore the\r\nharmonies of God and humanity, and consequently also of man with his\r\nnatural environment in this world, and with his spiritual environment\r\nin the higher world of the future. If it is true that nature now groans\r\nbecause of man's depravity, and that man himself shares in the evils\r\nof this disharmony with nature around him, it is clear that if man\r\ncould be restored to his true place in nature he would be restored\r\nto happiness and to harmony with God, and if, on the other hand, he\r\ncan be restored to harmony with God, he will then be restored also to\r\nharmony with his natural environment, and so to life and happiness and\r\nimmortality. It is here that the old story of Eden, and the teaching\r\nof Christ, and the prophecy of the New Jerusalem strike the same note\r\nwhich all material nature gives forth when we interrogate it respecting\r\nits relations to man. The profound manner in which these truths appear\r\nin the teaching of Christ has perhaps not been appreciated as it\r\nshould, because we have not sought in that teaching the philosophy of\r\nnature which it contains. When He points to the common weeds of the\r\nfields, and asks us to consider the garments more gorgeous than those\r\nof kings in which God has clothed them, and when He says of these same\r\nwild flowers, so daintily made by the Supreme Artificer, that to-day\r\nthey are, and to-morrow are cast into the oven, He gives us not merely\r\na lesson of faith, but a deep insight into that want of unison which,\r\ncentring in humanity, reaches all the way from the wild flower to the\r\nGod who made it, and requires for its rectification nothing less than\r\nthe breathing of that Divine Spirit which first evoked order and life\r\nout of primeval chaos.\r\n\r\n  References:--Articles in _Princeton Review_ on Man in Nature and on\r\n    Evolution. \"The Story of the Earth and Man.\" London, 1890. \"Modern\r\n    Ideas of Evolution.\" London, 1891.

By Sir J. W. Dawson, C.M.G., LL.D.,\r\nF.R.S. With Maps and Illustrations. 12mo, Cloth, $2 00.\r\n\r\n  The special object of the work, the author tells us, is \"to notice\r\n    the light which the scientific explorations of the countries of\r\n    the Bible may throw on the character and statements of the book.\"\r\n    It contains much interesting and valuable matter, and Sir J. W.\r\n    Dawson's opinions and explanations will doubtless meet with the\r\n    respect and attention which they merit.--_Academy_, London.\r\n\r\n  Will add to Professor Dawson's deservedly high reputation as a\r\n    scientist, and will be found to possess the same fascination for\r\n    the reader that has characterized his previous works.... The work\r\n    is not only a most interesting and valuable one from a scientific\r\n    point of view, but will prove a notable addition to Biblical\r\n    literature.--_Boston Traveller._\r\n\r\n  One of the most valuable of recent books for Bible students.... This\r\n    volume is a treatment at once scientific, and in the best sense\r\n    popular, of such phases of Bible lands as most impressed themselves\r\n    on the professor's mind when journeying in the East.--_Boston\r\n    Advertiser._\r\n\r\n  At once intensely interesting and instructive.--_Albany Press._\r\n\r\n  The author writes delightfully, even in his technical passages. His\r\n    book gives freshness to antiquity, and his personal adventures\r\n    and experiences, though told modestly, show him to be heroic as a\r\n    student of science and religion--_Philadelphia Bulletin._\r\n\r\n  A very interesting and instructive work.... Not its least charm\r\n    is the agreeable style in which it is written, and which makes\r\n    portions of it read like pages from a romance--_New York Sun._\r\n\r\n  A valuable book with a valuable aim.... The whole book is vigorous,\r\n    clear, strong, and adds another word of deep and honest thought to\r\n    correct errors, dissipate doubts, and stimulate faith.--_Zion's\r\n    Herald_, Boston.\r\n\r\n  A work of great scientific and Biblical value.--_Lutheran Observer_,\r\n    Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n  The book is plain, straightforward, and interesting, and its\r\n    scientific facts and deductions are of value.--_Western Christian\r\n    Advocate_, Cincinnati.\r\n\r\n  Professor Dawson in this volume adds to his well-earned fame, and we\r\n    predict for it an extensive sale.--_Evangelist_, New York.\r\n\r\n  Of priceless value for those who would read with understanding the\r\n    only real history the world has ever had, or will have, of the\r\n    first three thousand years of man's life in the world.--_Standard_,\r\n    Chicago.\r\n\r\nPublished by HARPER & BROTHERS, New York.\r\n\r\n_The above work in for sale by all booksellers, or will be sent by the\r\npublishers, postage prepaid, to any part of the United States, Canada,\r\nor Mexico, on receipt of price._\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE EARTH AND MAN.=\r\n\r\nThe Story of the Earth and Man. By J. W. Dawson, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S.,\r\nPrincipal and Vice-Chancellor of McGill University, Montreal. New\r\nEdition with Corrections and Additions. With a Colored Diagram and\r\nIllustrations. 12mo, Cloth, $1 50.\r\n\r\n  This little book is, on the whole, the best popular geology that has\r\n    ever come from the press. The subject is one that possesses the\r\n    strongest possible interest for the writer and awakens his greatest\r\n    enthusiasm. One of the strongest and most interesting chapters in\r\n    the volume is the first of the two on primitive man. The whole\r\n    book is remarkable for its simplicity, clearness, interest, and\r\n    vitality.--_Mail and Express_, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  The work is full of absorbing interest.--_Toledo Blade._\r\n\r\n  The book is a recognized authority on the subject of which it treats,\r\n    and worthy of a place in the library.--_S. S. Journal_, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  We advise any of our readers who have been carried away with the\r\n    evolution craze as something that indicates advanced thinking to\r\n    read this most valuable work.--_Christian Standard_, Cincinnati, O.\r\n\r\n  An excellent summary of geological history.--_Boston Literary World._\r\n\r\n  The author is an able opponent of the theories of the evolutionists,\r\n    and his discussion of the theme is interesting. His account of the\r\n    lowest and earliest form of animal life as exemplified in what he\r\n    calls the \"dawn animal,\" found by him in fossil state in Canada, is\r\n    of special interest.--_Brooklyn Eagle._\r\n\r\n  The last two chapters of the work on \"Primitive Man\" contain an\r\n    unanswerable argument against the Darwinian theory of evolution,\r\n    and will be found invaluable by all who are called to face\r\n    that phase of modern infidelity. We most earnestly commend the\r\n    volume.--_Chicago Interior._\r\n\r\n  This work has stood the test of criticism, and has won its way to\r\n    the position of a standard text-book. The learned author does not\r\n    accept theories for scientific facts, nor permit himself to be led\r\n    away by mere clamor. He goes to the bottom of things, and gets at\r\n    the truth if possible. He does not presume to build a scientific\r\n    system upon finely wrought suppositions. What is known of the\r\n    history of the earth and man the student will find in this book.\r\n    It comes up to date with its facts. We do not know its equal as\r\n    a text-book on this subject. It is sufficiently illustrated, and\r\n    beautifully printed, and has a copious index.--_San Francisco\r\n    Christian Advocate._\r\n\r\n  We cannot but give the greatest respect to the writer of this book,\r\n    who presents so vividly the history of the world's progress, and we\r\n    cannot but express admiration for that clear and precise style he\r\n    possesses.--_N. Y. Times._\r\n\r\nPublished by HARPER & BROTHERS, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  [hand] Harper & Brothers _will send the above work, postage prepaid, to\r\n    any part of the United States or Canada, on receipt of the price._\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE ORIGIN OF THE WORLD.=\r\n\r\nThe Origin of the World, according to Revelation and Science. By J. W.\r\nDawson, LL.D., F.R.S., F.G.S. 12mo, Cloth, $2 00.\r\n\r\n  The revised work is a cyclopædia that will be welcome to all who\r\n    desire a reconciliation of science and religion, in which the\r\n    Scriptures retain their authority. The appendices contain valuable\r\n    scientific criticism, and the treatise meets the controversy as it\r\n    is to-day.--_North American_, Philadelphia, Pa.\r\n\r\n  To all reverent students of the Bible this work will prove a valuable\r\n    boon in enabling them to determine the precise import of Biblical\r\n    references to creation, and how these may be harmonized with\r\n    modern discovery.... In an appendix the volume furnishes several\r\n    short essays on special points collateral to the general subject,\r\n    and important to the solution of some of its phases.--_N. Y.\r\n    Evangelist._\r\n\r\n  Briefly described, the book is a singularly suggestive study of the\r\n    first chapter of Genesis considered as an inspired revelation in\r\n    the light of modern science.--_Evening Post_, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  The book will commend itself to both scholars and the common people;\r\n    for, while the latter can understand, the former can enjoy\r\n    it.--_The Churchman_, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  Although most scientists and many theologians will doubtless differ\r\n    with the author's conclusions, yet he has shown so much ingenuity\r\n    and care in sustaining them, and is so evidently inspired by a\r\n    regard for what he desires to be the truth, that his book will\r\n    command the attention of candid inquirers of whatever shade of\r\n    belief.--_Boston Globe._\r\n\r\n  Mr. Dawson has devoted much study to the treatment of the subject\r\n    discussed in this volume. He has sought to get at the truth\r\n    alone.... The writer's style is clear and vigorous, and he has\r\n    patiently wrought out his theories from a wide and comprehensive\r\n    range of observation.--_Union-Argus_, Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  The work treats of the mystery of \"origins,\" the beginning of\r\n    creation, the \"desolate void,\" the various created objects light,\r\n    land, plants, animals, and finally man, whose unity of origin\r\n    and antiquity are made the subject of two chapters. An appendix,\r\n    containing short essays on special points, is a valuable feature of\r\n    the book.--_Observer_, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  Whether the reader accepts Dr. Dawson's conclusions or not,\r\n    he will find the work a wonderfully suggestive study, and\r\n    singularly fair in its treatment of the opinions and theories it\r\n    antagonizes.--_Free Press_, Detroit, Mich.\r\n\r\n  As a summary of creation, the book is lively and fresh. It will be\r\n    found interesting and profitable to all students of this alluring\r\n    theme.--_Christian Advocate_, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  At least no student of theology can afford not to possess this most\r\n    excellent work.--_Pittsburg Dispatch._\r\n\r\nPublished by HARPER & BROTHERS, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  [hand] Harper & Brothers _will send the above work, postage prepaid, to\r\n    any part of the United States or Canada, on receipt of the price._\r\n\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT AND VALUABLE BOOKS ON SCIENTIFIC SUBJECTS.\r\n\r\n  The Geographical Distribution of Animals.
