I now refer to ordinary\r\nMushroom Culture as practised in our best private gardens. I believe it\r\npossible and desirable to extend this, the only phase of the Culture\r\nthat can be called popular, in a tenfold degree, and that every place in\r\nwhich a gardener and horses are kept should be abundantly supplied with\r\nMushrooms throughout the greater part of the year. Secondly, that\r\nalthough Mushroom Culture as usually practised is perfectly well known\r\nto good cultivators, a simpler and fuller account of it than has yet\r\nappeared in any English book on the subject is desirable for the\r\nunpractised amateur and cultivator. Thirdly, that Mushroom Culture is at\r\npresent confined to a too narrow groove; and a belief that the general\r\ngardening public should have a broad and clear idea of the several ways\r\nin which they may procure abundance of excellent Mushrooms with very\r\ntrifling expense. Even many of the best private growers never think of\r\nit except as illustrated on their comparatively small beds in small\r\nhouses. I believe that if the knowledge of how easily and in how many\r\nways they may be grown, apart from the usual mode, were sufficiently\r\nspread, it would lead to the production of many times our present\r\nsupply. Fourthly, a desire to introduce to this and other countries the\r\nsystem of Mushroom Culture on a very large scale carried on in caverns\r\nbeneath the environs of Paris, which caverns I visited in 1868.\r\n\r\nTo these reasons I might add a wish to call attention to the waste of\r\nmoney for Mushroom-spawn that now occurs in nearly every garden. There\r\nis not the slightest necessity for this. In every garden where Mushrooms\r\nare grown abundance of spawn may be made. Mr. W. P. AYRES writes lately\r\nto tell me that in a great midland garden where the spawn bill used to\r\namount to 18_l._ or 19_l._ a year, by saving the spawn as the Parisian\r\ngrowers do, all expense for this article is abolished.\r\n\r\nI do not attempt to praise or even duly weigh the merits of the\r\nMushroom--that could only be adequately done by the immortal\r\nBRILLAT-SAVARIN. He, however, seems to have somewhat neglected this most\r\nprecious of _légumes_. None but his serious soul could have approached\r\nthe subject with the necessary solemnity. Nobody but he who first saw\r\nthe deep dangers of hurried, thoughtless, and irreverent feeding, could\r\nhave done justice to its exquisite flavour when in the best condition,\r\nor could have explained how deliciously it combined the virtues of herb\r\nand flesh, unspeakably superior to either. Let us, in passing, quote one\r\nof his aphorisms, contributed to form the _base éternelle à la science_:\r\n“_La découverte d’un mets nouveau fait plus pour le bonheur du genre\r\nhumain que la découverte d’une étoile!_”\r\n\r\nNow, I do not hesitate to say that the introduction of the Mushroom into\r\nour domestic economy in as great a degree as we have it in our power to\r\nproduce it, would practically be the addition of a new agent in our\r\n_cuisine_, second to none for its delicacy, and unsurpassed for utility.\r\nIt is true the Mushroom is plentiful in its season, but it is with us,\r\nat all seasons when it is not to be gathered in the open air, a luxury\r\nto numbers of owners of gardens who have means to grow it. As for the\r\nmuch larger class who ought to be supplied from our markets, they seldom\r\nsee or taste a Mushroom except when these occur in profusion in our\r\nfields, though every cart of stable-manure produced in this great\r\nhorse-keeping country may, on its way towards decomposition and\r\nreplenishing the earth, be made a nidus for furnishing many dishes of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations showing the cave-culture of mushrooms are from my\r\n“Parks, Promenades, and Gardens of Paris.” And the frontispiece is after\r\ntwo large cuts of the mushroom caves of Paris, which appeared in the\r\n_Illustrated London News_ some time after the appearance of my work. The\r\nillustrations of edible fungi are by Mr. WORTHINGTON G. SMITH, who knows\r\nand draws these interesting subjects so thoroughly well; and the other\r\nfigures are by Mr. HODGKIN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n    WHERE MUSHROOMS MAY BE GROWN                                     1\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n    MUSHROOM CULTURE IN THE MUSHROOM-HOUSE                           2\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n    THE PREPARATION OF THE MATERIALS, ETC.                          13\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n    MUSHROOM-SPAWN                                                  23\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    SPAWNING AND AFTER-TREATMENT                                    33\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n    CULTURE IN SHEDS, CELLARS, ARCHES, OUTHOUSES, AND ALL\r\n      ENCLOSED STRUCTURES OTHER THAN THE MUSHROOM-HOUSE             43\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n    THE CAVE CULTURE OF MUSHROOMS, NEAR PARIS                       57\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n    CULTURE ON PREPARED BEDS IN THE OPEN AIR IN GARDENS AND\r\n      FIELDS                                                        77\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n    CULTURE IN GARDENS, ETC., WITH OTHER CROPS IN THE OPEN AIR      84\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n    MUSHROOM CULTURE IN PASTURES, ETC.                              88\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    THE COMMON MUSHROOMS                                            95\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n    MODES OF COOKING THE COMMON MUSHROOMS                          102\r\n\r\n    CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n    SOME OF THE MOST COMMON AND USEFUL EDIBLE FUNGI                108\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHERE MUSHROOMS MAY BE GROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE places in which mushrooms can be grown may be roughly grouped as\r\nfollows:--1. In the mushroom-house proper. 2. In sheds, cellars,\r\nout-houses, stables, railway-arches, &c. 3. In deep caves, like those\r\nnear Paris, described further on. 4. In the open air, in gardens or\r\nfields, on prepared beds. 5. In gardens, among various crops, without\r\nany preparation beyond inserting the spawn. 6. In pastures where the\r\nmushroom is not already established.\r\n\r\nTo these I might add another group, illustrated by the case of a Belgian\r\ncook who grew a dish of mushrooms in a pair of old wooden shoes; but\r\npractically we can treat of nearly every possible mode of growing the\r\nmushroom under the above headings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM CULTURE IN THE MUSHROOM-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Mushroom-house at back of hothouses.]\r\n\r\nCULTURE in the mushroom-house being the most practised, and, on the\r\nwhole, the most important phase of the subject, we will first treat of\r\nit. And first of the mushroom-house itself. Its construction is very\r\nsimple: the conditions to be obtained are equable temperature, secured\r\nby thick or hollow walls and by a double roof. Figure 1 shows a house\r\ndesigned for me by Mr. Ormson, the well-known horticultural builder.\r\n\r\nIt is situated at the back of the hothouses, where a flow and return\r\npipe can be run through for artificial heat. The shelves for making the\r\nbeds upon are of slate 1½ in. thick, or of stone 2½ in. thick,\r\nbuilt into the walls, and into brick piers built in cement. Upright\r\nslates, to slide in grooves, are placed along the front of the shelves\r\nto keep the beds in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Ground-plan of preceding.]\r\n\r\nThe floor may be of paving tiles, or bricks, laid on concrete: a\r\nskylight or two may be fixed in the roof, for the purpose of admitting a\r\nlittle light, and air when necessary. The engraving (fig. 2), shows a\r\nhouse of this description, 12 feet wide by 20 feet long, inside measure,\r\nbut, of course, the length may be extended as circumstances may\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\nAs it is of importance in mushroom-growing that the air of the house\r\nshould be kept moderately moist, the underside of a slate or tile roof\r\nshould be lathed and plastered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. View of unheated mushroom-house.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Section of preceding figure.]\r\n\r\nFigure 3 represents a mushroom-house suitable for people of small means,\r\nor those who cannot adopt plan No. 1. It is designed with a view to\r\ngrowing mushrooms during the greater part of the year, without the aid\r\nof artificial heat. To this end it is constructed in such a way as not\r\nto be affected by changes of the external temperature, as will be seen\r\nby the engraving. The walls are hollow, and banked round with the soil\r\nexcavated from the interior. The roof is thatched with reeds, and the\r\nends stud-work, lined inside with boards, and outside with split larch\r\npoles: the cavity to be filled with sawdust or cut straw; a small\r\ndiamond-shaped ventilator, hung on pivots, to be fixed in each end. The\r\nfloor may be of concrete, or burnt clay well rammed; and the beds are\r\nretained in their place by boards nailed to good oak posts. Care should\r\nbe taken to put in efficient drains, so that no stagnant damp may exist\r\nabout the building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Section of mushroom-house at Frogmore.]\r\n\r\nThough the preceding cuts show how we may best attain our object, a few\r\nmore illustrations of mushroom-houses are desirable here. Figures 5 and\r\n6 exhibit the plan of the mushroom-houses at Frogmore, obligingly\r\ncommunicated by Mr. Rose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Ground-plan of mushroom-house at Frogmore.]\r\n\r\nIt need hardly be said that in such large mushroom-houses rhubarb and\r\nsea-kale may be easily forced, and barbe de capucin, endive, &c.\r\nblanched.\r\n\r\nA small hot-water apparatus, with a 3-inch flow and return pipe, affords\r\nthe best means of heating a mushroom-house which is not so situated that\r\nit may be heated from the boilers of adjacent hothouses. The best\r\nposition for the mushroom-house is against a north wall. The usual\r\nprecautions for guarding against damp walls and floor should be adopted\r\nin the case of the mushroom-house, and the walls should be hollow.\r\n\r\nForsyth’s mushroom-house is described by the designer in Loudon’s\r\n_Gardener’s Magazine_. Fig. 7 is a transverse section, showing the\r\narches under and over the beds, the thoroughfare _a_ is the middle, and\r\nthe position of the hot-water pipes, _c_; _b_ is an open shed and\r\ngeneral workshop, the receptacle of everything requiring protection, and\r\ntoo clumsy to be otherwise housed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Mushroom-house under shed.]\r\n\r\nA shed of this description is an indispensable adjunct to every\r\nwell-ordered garden, and in the present case it serves as a roof to the\r\nmushroom-house. In the centre of each vault, shown in fig. 7, a circular\r\nventilator, _d_, 9 in. in diameter, should be made, having a stone and\r\ncast-iron stopper, with a folding ring. The whole roof of the\r\nmushroom-house is covered over with pavement, which at the same time\r\nforms the floor of the shed above. Mr. Forsyth objects to cast-iron\r\nshelves “on account of the rust, and to slate shelves, as being cold and\r\ndamp, and therefore not suitable to the purpose;” but he knows of no\r\nobjection to shelves built of bricks and mortar, kerbed with hewn stone\r\n3 in. wide, and clamped together with lead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Mushroom-house at Stoke Place.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe annexed diagrams (figs. 8 and 9) exhibit the mushroom-houses used at\r\nStoke Place, both for summer and winter use, as described by Macintosh\r\nin the “Book of the Garden.” “Of course the former is not heated; the\r\nlatter is, by 4-inch hot-water pipes, which are brought from a boiler\r\nconstructed to heat at the same time a range of pits for pines, melons,\r\n&c., 89 feet long and 7 feet wide. The shelves are close-bottomed to\r\nprevent the beds from drying too rapidly, and to require less watering,\r\nwhich Mr. Patrick thinks a very important precaution in mushroom\r\nculture. Ventilation is effected by a slide in the door, and a wooden\r\ntrunk up through the arch and roof, with a slide in it also. We do not\r\nexactly see the motive of Mr. Patrick, whom we have long known and\r\nesteemed as one of the best gardeners in England, in adopting the span\r\nroof over this house, as, from its situation behind the garden wall, a\r\nlean-to roof would have been cheaper and carried off the rain-water\r\nbetter. It is rather a novel, but still a good plan, to have the inner\r\nroof constructed of a brick arch, as it will of course save the outer\r\none from decay, to which all mushroom-house roofs are liable more than\r\nany other kind of garden building. This house struck us at first sight\r\nas very complete, excepting in breadth. We should increase it to 9\r\nfeet--that is, 3 feet for the breadth of the beds on each side, and the\r\nsame for the footpath, which at present is inconveniently narrow.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Russian mushroom-house.]\r\n\r\nThe Russian mushroom-house (fig. 10) is thus described by Mr. Oldacre,\r\nin the _Horticultural Society’s Transactions_, vol. ii. first series.\r\n“The outside walls should be 8½ feet high for four heights of beds,\r\nand 6½ for three heights, and 10 feet wide inside the walls. This is\r\nthe most convenient width, as it admits of shelves 3½ feet wide on\r\neach side, and affords a space through the middle of the house 3 feet\r\nwide, for a double flue and a walk upon it.” Hot-water pipes were not in\r\nuse when this house was erected. “The walls should be 9 inches thick,\r\nand the length of the house as may be judged necessary. When the outside\r\nof the house is built, place a ceiling over it (as high as the top of\r\nthe walls) of boards 1 inch thick, and plaster it on the upper side with\r\nroad sand well wrought together, 1 inch thick, (this will be found\r\nsuperior to lime), leaving square trunks, _f_, in the ceiling 9 inches\r\nin width, up the middle of the house, at 6 feet distance from each\r\nother, with slides, _s_, under them, to admit and take off air when\r\nnecessary. This being done, erect two single-brick walls, _v v_, each\r\nfive bricks high, at the distance of 3½ feet from the outside walls,\r\nto hold up the sides of the lower beds, _a a_, and form one side of the\r\nair-flue, _t u t u_, leaving 3 feet up the middle, _t x t_, of the house\r\nfor the floor. Upon these walls, _v v_, lay planks, _t u_, 4½ inches\r\nwide and 3 inches thick, in which to mortise the standards, _t k_, which\r\nsupport the shelves. These standards should be 3½ inches square, and\r\nplaced 4 feet 6 inches asunder, and fastened at the top to the ceiling\r\njoists. When the standards are set up, fix the cross-bearers, _i n i n_,\r\nthat are to support the shelves, _o o_, mortising one end of each into\r\nthe standards, _n_, the other into the walls, _i_. The first set of\r\nbearers should be 2 feet from the floor, and each succeeding set 2 feet\r\nfrom that below it. Having thus fixed the uprights, _t k_, and bearers,\r\n_i n_, at such a height as the building will admit, proceed to form the\r\nshelves, _o o_, with boards 1½ inches thick, observing to place a\r\nboard, _d d_, 8 inches broad and 1 inch thick, in the front of each\r\nshelf, to support the front of the beds. Fasten this board on the\r\noutside standards, that the width of the beds may not be diminished. The\r\nshelves being completed, the next thing to be done is the construction\r\nof the flue (_p_ in section), which should commence at the end of the\r\nhouse next to the door, run parallel to the shelves all the length of\r\nthe house, and return back to the fireplace, where the chimney should be\r\nbuilt; the sides of the flue inside to be of the height of four bricks\r\nlaid flatways, and 6 inches wide, which will make the width of the flues\r\n15 inches from outside to outside, and leave a cavity, _t u_, on each\r\nside betwixt the flue and the walls that are under the shelves, and one,\r\n_x y_, up the middle, betwixt the flues, 2 inches wide, to admit the\r\nheat into the house from the sides of the flues.” The introduction of\r\nthis form of house by Mr. Oldacre has led to much improvement in our\r\nmushroom culture. The first house of this kind erected in England, was\r\nbuilt at Shipley, near Derby, in the garden of E. M. Mundy, Esq., by the\r\nfather of Mr. W. P. Ayres, whose name will be found frequently mentioned\r\nin this work. There brick arches were formed for the shelves, and though\r\nbuilt more than half a century ago, the house is still in good\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nAlthough slate is generally used for the shelves, the adoption of\r\ncast-iron gratings for this purpose is well worth a trial, as by this\r\nmeans we may be enabled to cut mushrooms from the under as well as the\r\nupper side of the bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PREPARATION OF THE MATERIALS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE we deal with the various ways of growing the mushroom, we will\r\nspeak of the preparation of the material. As stable manure not only\r\nfurnishes the nutriment, but forms the very soil in which mushrooms are\r\nproduced artificially, and also supplies the heat which enables us to\r\ngrow them to perfection at all seasons, by far the most important point\r\nconnected with their culture is the management of this. It is very\r\nsimple, but frequently, even by excellent gardeners, considered to\r\nrequire much more trouble and nicety than is really necessary. For\r\nexample, it is quite common in good gardens to see the droppings\r\ncollected carefully in some shed, or in the mushroom-house, and turned\r\nover almost as tenderly and carefully as the contents of the fruit-room.\r\nGood mushrooms are well worth this trouble; but, as it is quite\r\nunnecessary, it should not be done except in special cases.\r\n\r\nTo show the diversity of opinion among excellent mushroom-growers as to\r\nthe preparation of the manure, I will quote a few of our most\r\ntrustworthy authorities on the subject. Mr. W. Early, in “How to Grow\r\nMushrooms,” lays great stress on the importance of gathering the\r\ndroppings in a dry state. “Every advantage should be taken of\r\nopportunities of securing and placing them in any open shed, or other\r\nsimilar position, where they can be effectually sheltered from rains. In\r\nsuch a place, whilst the process of collecting is going on, every\r\nportion should be spread loosely over the floor, in moderate sized\r\nridges, or in any other manner that will allow the air to get amongst it\r\nto assist in drying. It should also be tossed over or turned, and\r\nlightened up daily for the same purpose, until a sufficiency is gathered\r\ntogether for immediate use.”\r\n\r\nThis may be taken as a sample of the practice very extensively followed\r\nin this country. Happily, we have excellent mushroom growers who succeed\r\nwithout all this trouble, as the following remarks of Mr. J. Barnes will\r\nshow:--“For the last thirty years I have made my beds entirely on the\r\nfloor in sheds, wheeling in the stable dung as it is brought fresh from\r\nthe stable, adding a fourth, or a little more than a fourth, of good\r\nfriable loam, mixing both well together, pressing firmly down, and\r\nletting it remain about a week or so untouched. At the end of that time\r\nwe turn it over, and if we consider it in too strong a state of\r\nfermentation we add a little more soil, and then tread down firmly.\r\nVery soon the bed is ready to be spawned, and encased in a couple of\r\ninches of soil; and in this way we get the finest crops of mushrooms,\r\nthe beds remaining a long time in bearing. After the beds have been some\r\ntime, say from six to twelve weeks, in bearing, and begin to get dry,\r\nand cease to bear well, we water them thoroughly with very clear liquid\r\nmanure, made from sheep or deer or cow manure, which seems to start them\r\nagain into bearing, and then we manage to keep some of the beds in\r\nbearing for many months at a time.” In the _Field_, Dec. 22, 1868, I\r\nstated that the manure for the mushroom-beds in the Royal Gardens,\r\nFrogmore, was not prepared in any elaborate way, but simply taken from a\r\ngreat heap fermenting in the yard, any parts of it that had become white\r\nfrom heat being moistened with water, and the whole being mixed with\r\nabout a fourth part of loam. Mr. Cuthill, an authority on mushroom\r\nculture, tells us how the London market gardeners manage with their\r\nmanure. As the material is brought home from the London stables, the\r\nshort part is taken out of it, and the long litter is kept for the\r\npurpose of covering, as well as for forming the interior of ridges; for\r\nall mushroom-beds out of doors are made into ridges. The manure is not\r\nallowed to heat before it is put into the beds, if that can be\r\nprevented; for previously heated material does not produce such fine\r\nmushrooms. The fresher the horse-dung is, the longer the crop will last\r\nand every gardener who makes up beds with unheated droppings knows how\r\nsuperior they are to fermented manure.\r\n\r\nIn his own practice Mr. C. depended a good deal on heavy tramping to\r\n“keep down fermentation” when droppings were used in a fresh state. The\r\nFrench, who are great mushroom growers, allow the manure to heat first,\r\nbut treat it very simply. They prepare it in the open air, first\r\nremoving any pieces of wood or other extraneous matter that may have\r\nbeen mixed with it, and then place it long and short in beds two feet\r\nthick, or a little more, pressing it with the fork. When this is done,\r\nthe mass or bed is well stamped, then thoroughly watered, and finally\r\nagain pressed down by stamping. It is left in this state for eight or\r\nten days, by which time it has begun to ferment, after which the bed\r\nought to be well turned over and re-made on the same place, care being\r\ntaken to place the manure that was near the sides at first towards the\r\ncentre in the turning and re-making. The mass is now left for another\r\nten days or so, at the end of which time the manure is about in proper\r\ncondition for making the beds, either in the open air or in the caves.\r\nSometimes it receives three turnings over, especially when the manure is\r\nlong, and it occupies altogether about six weeks in preparation. As the\r\nwide heaps are turned over by the men, a water-cart remains alongside,\r\nand any portions of the mass that are dry and white from heat are\r\nmoistened with water from a rose watering pot. This preparation shortens\r\nand mollifies the longer material considerably, mixes the mass well, and\r\nit is transferred to the caves in a slightly decomposed, well mixed, and\r\nmoist, but not wet, condition. The French do not actually hammer or\r\ndesperately tramp down the beds, as nearly all our writers on mushroom\r\nculture recommend, but press it pretty firmly; and I have seen as good\r\ncrops on their light spongy beds as ever I have on those so firmly\r\ntramped down. I might give other striking instances of the diversity of\r\nopinion on this subject, but it is needless to multiply them.\r\n\r\nMy conclusions respecting the preparation of the manure for mushrooms\r\nare as follows:--1. That very careful preparation and frequent turning\r\nover of the manure undercover are not necessary to success, and that it\r\nis quite needless to prepare the manure under cover, except when it is\r\ngathered in a very small quantity, so that a heavy rain or snow would\r\nsaturate it. Where, however, the culture is pursued on a very small\r\nscale, and, it may be, only one bed made, it is best to keep it in a\r\ncovered shed. 2. That carefully picked droppings are not essential,\r\nthough they may be more convenient. Excellent crops are gathered from\r\nbeds made with ordinary stable manure, droppings and long materials\r\nmixed as they come; but when the manure is used as it comes from the\r\nstable, it should be allowed to ferment before being used. 3. That the\r\nbest way of preparing manure for the general culture of mushrooms\r\nindoors, is to gather it in some firm spot, and allow it to lose its\r\nfierce heat. As it is usually gathered in an irregular way, precise\r\ndirections as to turning over cannot well be given; but I am convinced\r\nthat one turning will suffice when it has arrived at a strong heat, and\r\nthen it should be thrown together for a week or so, when, in being\r\ndisturbed and removed to make the bed or beds, its strong heat will be\r\nsufficiently subdued. Where large quantities of stable manure are in a\r\nfermenting state, there should be little difficulty in selecting\r\nmaterial to form a bed at any time. Should it have spent its heat\r\novermuch, it would be easy to revive it with some fresh droppings. 4.\r\nThat stable manure may be used when fresh, but it should be always mixed\r\nwith more than a fourth of good loamy soil. If this be kept under cover,\r\nor stacked so that it may be had in a rather dry condition, so much the\r\nbetter, especially if the fresh manure, &c., should be over moist. Beds\r\nthus made are most suited for cool sheds and the open gardens. 5. That a\r\nportion, say nearly one-fifth to one-third, of good and rather dry loam\r\nmay always be advantageously mixed with the stable manure; the fresher\r\nthe materials, the more loam should be used. In all cases it helps to\r\nsolidify the bed, and it is probable that the addition of the loam adds\r\nto the fertility and duration of the bed. 6. That a thickness of from\r\none foot to fifteen inches for the beds in an artificially heated house\r\nis quite sufficient. Eighteen inches will not be too much for beds made\r\nin sheds, though I have seen excellent crops on beds only a foot thick,\r\nin common sheds with leaky sides. All beds made indoors should be flat\r\nand firmly beaten down, though the absence of firmness is not, as some\r\nthink, sufficient to account for want of success.\r\n\r\nI will now quote a few words from Mr. Ayres on other materials for\r\nforming mushroom-beds than stable manure. He has given this, like almost\r\nevery important subject in the range of horticulture, some attention.\r\nFirst among these may be mentioned sawdust which has been used for\r\nbedding horses or for riding-school tracks. Such a substance, thoroughly\r\nimpregnated with urine and mixed with horse-droppings, forms an\r\nexcellent material for mushroom-beds, especially if mixed with\r\none-fourth of good fibrous loam. Such materials mixed and fermented\r\ntogether, and thrown into a bed a foot or eighteen inches in thickness,\r\naccording to the temperature of the shed in which the bed is made, will\r\nbe found to form capital material for growing this esculent, especially\r\nas it retains the heat for a long time. The worst of it is that the\r\nmaterial is almost valueless after it has served the first purpose; and\r\nused as dung upon light land is rather injurious than otherwise. Then\r\nyou may use leaves and loam, in the proportion of one part of the\r\nlatter, in a turfy state, to four or five of fermenting leaves. These\r\nmay be recently gathered from the trees, and should be allowed to attain\r\na brisk heat before the loam is added, and then, after sweating for a\r\nweek or ten days, may be turned, mixing the materials intimately\r\ntogether, and then the mass may be formed into a bed. A mushroom-bed of\r\nthis kind should not be less than fifteen inches in thickness when\r\nthoroughly consolidated; and when so managed it will grow mushrooms just\r\nas well as dung. The sweepings of our streets and cattle markets,\r\nespecially those parts that are paved and much frequented by horses--as,\r\nfor example, cabstands, &c.--if collected when dry, and fermented a\r\nlittle, yield capital material for beds. Here from the cattle market we\r\nhave the dung of horses, sheep, and cows mixed together in a finely\r\ndivided state, the heating of which is gentle and regular. Material of\r\nthis kind procured on dry days, thrown together to ferment once or\r\ntwice, and then made into well-consolidated beds, will produce mushrooms\r\nof the finest quality, and continue in bearing a very long time. It is\r\nof the first importance that this material be collected in a dry state,\r\nas of course the slush of the streets would not do at all. Equal\r\nproportions of street sweepings and fresh leaves, properly fermented and\r\nmixed with loam, would perhaps make as good material for growing\r\nmushrooms as need be obtained. Of course the sweepings from those parts\r\nof the town most frequented by horses will be the best for the purpose I\r\nam writing about.\r\n\r\nThe idea of mushrooms ceasing to be prolific from the exhaustion of the\r\nactive manure in the bed, I have mooted before. Lately several\r\nexperiments have been tried which convince me that by taking three\r\nportions of recently-gathered leaves to one of turfy loam, and working\r\nthem well together until the mass attains the desired temperature,\r\nsprinkling it, as the work of turning proceeds, with liquid direct from\r\nthe stables, and forming this into a bed treated in the usual manner, it\r\nwill give just as good mushrooms as the best horse manure in the world.\r\nIt is the ammonia that is wanted for this crop, with a gentle heat.\r\nSecure these two things, and, with ordinary care, success is certain.\r\n\r\nBefore making the beds, while the material is in preparation, all\r\nparticles of old wood, twigs, &c., that are found in the manure should\r\nbe removed, as indeed should any extraneous matters likely to prove\r\noffensive or useless.\r\n\r\nThe best time for making mushroom-beds, where they are not regularly\r\nmade in succession throughout the autumn and winter months, as they\r\nought to be where there is abundance of material and a good\r\nmushroom-house, is in August and September, as in the early autumn\r\nmonths the natural heat is sufficient to cause the spawn to germinate\r\nfreely, and beds made then ought to bear freely before and up to\r\nChristmas, and during autumn.\r\n\r\nWhen making the bed, the chief object to bear in mind is the equal\r\nplacing of the material. It should be well mixed and regularly and\r\nfirmly placed so that the whole may be of a similar texture. Some\r\nheavily tramp and pound their beds to secure firmness; moderately done\r\nthis is beneficial; thoroughly equable pressure with the fork, when the\r\nfork can be used, will with the pressure of firm earthing be sufficient;\r\nwhen beds are made on elevated benches in boxes, and in all positions\r\nwhere but a slight body of material is used, and where firmness cannot\r\nresult from the general pressure of the mass, some kind of pressure with\r\na wooden mallet or the like must be employed.\r\n\r\nThe beds once made, we next arrive at the spawning, and will first\r\ninquire, What is spawn?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM-SPAWN.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE first thing we have to determine is, What is spawn? Generally, the\r\nspawn, or what in scientific language is called the _mycelium_, is\r\nsupposed to be analogous to seed, while it really is what may be termed\r\nthe vegetation of the plant, or something analogous to roots, stems, and\r\nleaves of ordinary plants, the visible part or stem, head and gills, of\r\nthe mushroom being, in fact, the fructification, though in such an\r\napparent preponderance to the other parts. A knowledge of the anatomy\r\nand life-history of the mushroom is not necessary to the cultivator, and\r\nis not familiar even to those who make of mushrooms a study. We know\r\nthat the gills are simply surfaces on which germs or spores are\r\nproduced. The membrane that covers the spore plates of a single mushroom\r\nwould cover a large space if spread out, and the spores are counted by\r\nmyriads. We can see them clearly enough under the microscope--can see in\r\nwhat manner they are borne on and fixed to the gills; but of the history\r\nof their lives, from the time they fall from the surfaces on which they\r\nwere born, till the “young mushroom” or inflorescence is vigorously\r\npushing up from the mass of delicate vegetation which they have given\r\nrise to in earth or decaying manure, we know nothing. However, the\r\npreparation of the spawn, and the subsequent management of it in the\r\nmushroom-bed, are the matters which really concern us.\r\n\r\nHow is spawn obtained in the first instance? It is found in a natural\r\nstate in half-decomposed manure-heaps, in places where horse-droppings\r\nhave accumulated and been kept dry, in riding-schools, sheds to which\r\nhorses have long had access, in “mill tracks” under cover, in pastures,\r\nin partially decayed hotbeds, &c., and rarely or never in very moist or\r\nsaturated materials. This spawn, sometimes termed “natural” in this\r\ncountry, and called by the French “virgin spawn,” is the best that can\r\nbe obtained, and should be used in preference wherever it can be found.\r\nTo use it, all that has to be done is to divide the material permeated\r\nby the white spawn into pieces a few inches square, and say an inch or\r\nmore thick. They will of course break up irregularly, but all should be\r\nused, whether of the size of a bean, or nearly that of the open hand.\r\nThen they are inserted into the surface of the mushroom-beds in the\r\nordinary way.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every country place, and in numerous suburban ones, in fact,\r\nin most places where horses are kept, opportunities of finding this\r\nspawn occur. Its white, filamentous, and downy threads have the odour\r\nof mushrooms, and the spawn is, therefore, very easily recognised. It\r\nshould be generally known that it need not be used when found, but may\r\nbe dried, and kept for use in a dry place for years, and has been known\r\nto keep as long as fourteen years. It must not be supposed that it is\r\nonly the hard bricks described further on that keep thus. The French\r\nspawn is in much looser and lighter material than that in which we\r\nusually find _mycelium_ in a natural state, and it keeps quite as long\r\nas ours. To preserve spawn found in a natural state, nothing more is\r\nrequired than to take up carefully the parts of the manure in which it\r\nis found, not breaking them up more than may be necessary, and placing\r\nboth large and small pieces loosely in rough shallow hampers. These\r\nshould be placed in some dry airy loft or shed till thoroughly dry, and\r\nafterwards kept in some perfectly dry place, packed in rough boxes till\r\nwanted for use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Brick mushroom-spawn.]\r\n\r\nBut inasmuch as in this country, at present, but little mushroom-spawn\r\nis required in any one place, the rule is to obtain artificial spawn in\r\nthe form of hard bricks. This spawn is made from horse-droppings and\r\nsome cowdung and road scrapings beaten up into a mortar-like consistency\r\nin a shed, and then formed into bricks, slightly differing in shape with\r\ndifferent makers, but usually thinner and wider than common building\r\nbricks. Various recipes are given for mixing the materials for the\r\nbricks, and among them the following are about the best:--1.\r\nHorse-droppings the chief part, cowdung a fourth, and the remainder\r\nloam. 2. Fresh horse-droppings mixed with short litter the greater part,\r\ncowdung one third, and the rest mould or loam. 3. Horsedung, cowdung,\r\nand loam in equal parts. These bricks are placed in some dry, airy\r\nplace, and when half dry, a little bit of spawn about as big as a hazel\r\nnut, is placed in the centre of each; or sometimes, when the bricks are\r\nas wide as long, a particle is put near each corner, just inserted below\r\nthe surface, and plastered over with the composition of which the bricks\r\nare made. When the bricks are nearly dry, they are placed on a hotbed\r\nabout a foot thick, in a shed or dry place. On this the bricks are\r\npiled, or placed rather openly and loosely, and covered over with\r\nlitter, so that the heat may circulate equably amongst them. The\r\ntemperature should not rise more than a degree or two above 60 degrees;\r\nif it does, it may easily be modified by reducing or removing the\r\ncovering of litter. The makers frequently examine the bricks during the\r\nprocess, and when the spawn has been found to spread throughout a brick\r\nlike a fine white mould, it is removed, and allowed to dry for future\r\nuse in a dark, dry place. If allowed to go further than the fine white\r\nmould stage, and form threads and tubercles in the bricks, it has then\r\nattained to a higher degree of development than is consistent with\r\npreserving its vegetative powers, and therefore it should be removed\r\nfrom the bed in the fine mould stage. This is the kind of mushroom spawn\r\nmostly in use in our gardens, and it is usually very hard in texture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. Mill-track mushroom-spawn.]\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of spawn used in some gardens called mill-track\r\nmushroom-spawn, which is made in a more simple manner than the\r\npreceding. It would seem to be simply spawn that has spread through the\r\nthoroughly amalgamated droppings of a mill-track. The material is\r\nrather soft and free in texture, is usually sold in large and somewhat\r\nirregular lumps, and is much used by some cultivators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. Parisian mushroom-spawn.]\r\n\r\nFinally, we have the French mushroom-spawn, which differs from our own\r\nin not being in bricks or solid lumps, but in rather light masses of\r\nscarcely half decomposed, comparatively loose and dry litter. This spawn\r\nis obtained by preparing a little bed as if for mushrooms in the\r\nordinary way, and spawning it with morsels of virgin spawn, if that is\r\nobtainable; and then when the spawn has spread through it, the bed is\r\nbroken up and used for spawning beds in the caves, or dried and\r\npreserved for sale. It is sold in small boxes, and is fit for insertion\r\nwhen pulled in rather thin pieces, about half the size of the open hand;\r\nbut in separating it, it divides into many pieces, of all sizes, every\r\nparticle of which should be used. The small particles should be strewn\r\nbroadcast over the bed after the larger pieces have been inserted. This\r\napplies to the other kinds. In consequence of the open porous nature of\r\nthe French mushroom-spawn, it is likely to be immediately affected by\r\nthe heat and moisture of the genially warm manure forming the\r\nmushroom-bed, and on that account alone presents some advantages. It has\r\nrecently been introduced for the first time, and probably will soon be\r\ntested by many growers.\r\n\r\nSpawn, in the common sense of the word, may be dispensed with by well\r\namalgamating manure, loam, and old mushroom-beds, or leaf-mould\r\ncontaining traces of spawn, and these formed into beds about a foot\r\nthick in the mushroom-house, and covered with earth, produce without any\r\nfurther spawning; but the plan is not so simple or advantageous as that\r\nmore commonly pursued.\r\n\r\nThere is no necessity for purchasing artificial spawn at all where\r\nmushrooms are regularly grown. Nor is there in any case except at the\r\ncommencement, or to guard against one’s own spawn proving bad. To secure\r\ngood spawn, we have only to do as the French growers do: take a portion\r\nof a bed where it is thoroughly permeated by the spawn and before it\r\nbegins to bear, and preserve it for future use.\r\n\r\nOf the efficacy of this sort of spawn, if any proof were needed in\r\naddition to the fine crops the Parisian growers gather, it will be found\r\nin the following statement from Mr. Ayres:--\r\n\r\n“A short time back, attention was directed to the superior quality of\r\nFrench mushroom-spawn, and as a natural consequence several London\r\nseedsmen imported it for sale. Some months back I obtained possession of\r\na stable, and, wishing to grow mushrooms in it, procured a few tons of\r\nhorse manure, just as it came from the dung-pit of the hotel stables. It\r\nwas very wet, and consequently when thrown together it heated violently.\r\nHowever, by frequent turning for a week or ten days this tendency was\r\nreduced, and then five beds were formed of it, adding one-fourth of\r\nperfectly dry soil from a cucumber-house. I say perfectly dry, because\r\nthe soil had lain in the house for fifteen or eighteen months without\r\nreceiving a drop of water, and therefore may almost be considered as\r\nthoroughly dry. Intimately mixed with the fermenting dung, it had the\r\ntendency that I desired--viz., subdued the excessive moisture, and,\r\nafter the bed had been made up a week, brought it to the temperature\r\nnecessary to receive the spawn.\r\n\r\n“Having great faith in the good qualities of fresh loam from an old\r\npasture for the production of mushrooms of superior quality, I had a\r\nquantity dried and warmed. I had a coat of this three inches thick laid\r\nover each bed, and then forked carefully in, taking care to mix the soil\r\nand dung as intimately as possible. Re-formed and left for a few days\r\nthe beds attained the necessary warmth; then they were made quite firm,\r\nand were ready for spawning.\r\n\r\n“For this purpose I had procured two boxes of the French spawn from\r\nMessrs. Barr and Sugden, of Covent Garden. It was light, loose, flaky,\r\nchaffy stuff, and so dry that I had some fear whether its vegetating\r\npower had not been dried out of it. But the spawn had been bought for\r\nexperiment, and therefore the experiment must be carried out.\r\n\r\n“Raking about two inches of the material from the surface of each bed,\r\npieces of the flaky spawn were laid down, at about ten inches or a foot\r\napart, all over the beds; the fine portions of the spawn were then\r\nscattered over the beds, patted down firmly with the back of a spade,\r\nand then the surface material was returned, and the whole made as firm\r\nas possible. In passing, it may not be out of place to remark that\r\nspawning in this manner must be guided, or rather governed, by the state\r\nof the material of the bed. If it is not sufficiently cooled, it will be\r\nsafer to make holes in the usual manner for the spawn; but if in a fit\r\nstate, then I think the broadcast spawning and earthing, as before\r\ndescribed, is the best plan. The disturbed portion of the beds having\r\nregained its heat, and there being no fear of its _over_heating, the\r\nbeds were immediately earthed two inches thick with fresh loam, beaten\r\nquite firm, and then covered with a thin layer of dry hay.\r\n\r\n“Not liking to entrust my chance of mushrooms entirely to the new\r\nmaterial, the French spawn, two beds were spawned at the same time and\r\nin the same manner with native spawn. Owing to the large size of the\r\nstable, and the unusually cold, piercing weather at the end of the year\r\n(1869), the beds lost so much heat that I had some misgivings whether\r\nthey would not prove a failure; but finding, subsequently, that the\r\nspawn was working, I gave each bed (the surface being rather dry) a good\r\nsyringing with water at the temperature of 80 deg., covered it with\r\nclean dry mats, and then returned the hay. The beds are now a sheet of\r\nthe ‘pearl of the fields,’ some of the patches as large as a\r\ncheese-plate, and the whole in most promising condition--so promising\r\nthat, with proper attention, I have no doubt they will yield a good\r\nsupply of mushrooms for many months. To secure this continuous bearing,\r\nfarmyard manure-water and salt, at proper times, should not be spared;\r\nwhile, as soon as the flush of the first crop is over, the beds may\r\nreceive a thorough soaking of manure-water at a temperature of not less\r\nthan 80 deg., be re-earthed with fresh soil, and covered down with mats\r\nand hay. In this manner we always get a second crop little inferior to\r\nthe first one, and sometimes much superior.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nSPAWNING AND AFTER-TREATMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Heat and Protection._\r\n\r\nTHE temperature of the material of the beds should never, at spawning\r\ntime, exceed 80 degrees Fahr.--about 70 is the most suitable regular\r\ntemperature; and that of the mushroom-house should range between 50 and\r\n60 degrees--not lower than 50. Assuming the materials to have been\r\nturned once after having heated, and again disturbed previous to being\r\nmade into beds, they ought to be in a condition for spawning from ten to\r\ntwelve days after being put together. It need hardly be said that this\r\nregularity of temperature can only be secured in properly-formed\r\nmushroom-houses. Where mushrooms are grown in these, with double\r\nceilings and close-fitting shutters and doors, almost impervious to\r\nexternal influences, and where fresh beds are made from time to time,\r\nlittle or no artificial heat from pipes is required, though it is as\r\nwell to have some at command in the case of unusually severe weather, or\r\na break in the succession of beds, which would cause a deficiency of\r\nheat from fermenting materials. A covering of hay or dry litter is\r\nnecessary for beds formed in the open air, and also for beds made in\r\ncool, half-open sheds; but not for those in regularly heated\r\nmushroom-houses or caves, in which there is a still, steady temperature.\r\nIt should be about a foot thick, and should be immediately removed when\r\nit becomes wet or mouldy. This covering should be applied whenever the\r\ntemperature of the bed begins to fall. It should not be used in any case\r\nwhere the temperature will permit of dispensing with it, as it is\r\ntroublesome, and sometimes encourages insects. The heat of a bed may be\r\nreduced by opening holes six or eight inches deep with a thick pointed\r\ndibber, here and there, but it is only in exceptional cases that this is\r\nadvisable, and it is desirable to husband all the ammonia and heat of\r\nthe bed. The earthing over and firming of a bed has a tendency to subdue\r\nthe heat in it. Where large sloping beds, say three feet deep at back,\r\nare made against the wall, I have seen Λ-shaped crates put beneath\r\nthem at six feet apart, so as to permit of heating them by fresh\r\nsupplies of manure. It is, however, a plan possessing little claim to\r\ngeneral use. It is best not to depend on the hand, as is commonly done,\r\nfor ascertaining the heat of the beds. Thermometers fixed on sticks of\r\nconvenient size, to thrust in the beds, are sold, and remove all excuse\r\nfor vagueness in this matter. Coverings of litter are sometimes useful\r\nin “drawing-up the heat” in a bed that has become somewhat chilled.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spawning._\r\n\r\nThis is the phase of the culture which requires most attention, as to\r\nget the spawn to run regularly through the bed is to be nearly certain\r\nof securing a good crop. In this respect there do not seem to be so many\r\ndifferences of opinion among mushroom growers. Some, indeed, spawn\r\nimmediately after the bed is made up; but, except where the materials\r\nare such as will not heat to more than 80 degrees, this is uncertain, or\r\nin other words bad, practice.\r\n\r\nThe important thing should be to ascertain if the spawn spreads through\r\nthe bed properly. The usual practice is to earth up the bed immediately\r\nor very soon after it is spawned, and not a few take no further notice\r\nof the bed or beds till the time arrives when the mushrooms ought to\r\nappear. A better plan is not to finally earth the bed until the spawn is\r\nseen beginning to spread its white filaments through the mass; and\r\nshould it fail to begin to do this in eight or ten days after\r\nspawning--the conditions being favourable--it is then better to insert\r\nfresh spawn or to re-make the bed, adding fresh materials if it be found\r\nto fail from being too cold. If people generally were to see whether the\r\nspawn had “taken” freely, instead of waiting for many weeks, not knowing\r\nwhether it had or not, there would be fewer disappointments in mushroom\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary spawn bricks should be broken into pieces, say from about\r\nthe size of walnuts to that of eggs; they do not break up into regular\r\nportions. Spawn in the more natural form in which we take it from the\r\nold beds, and in which it is used by the French, is ready to be inserted\r\ninto the bed without any further manipulation. I believe this kind of\r\nspawn spreads more rapidly through the beds than our own brick spawn,\r\nand is, on the whole, much more desirable. As it is usually very dry it\r\nis a good plan to place some of it in the mushroom-house a few days\r\nbefore spawning, so that it may begin to absorb moisture. A dark place\r\nin a warm house, or gentle hotbed, would do as well, but in no case\r\nshould it be done more than three days before spawning time. At spawning\r\nthis might with advantage be mixed with some that has not gone through\r\nthis process. A bushel of the ordinary brick spawn will suffice to spawn\r\nabout one hundred square feet. All spawn should be inserted near the\r\nsurface, just buried in the materials of which the bed is made. The thin\r\nflakes of spawn which the French use, and which are usually nearly the\r\nlength and breadth of the open hand, are generally inserted into the bed\r\nedgeways, or in a direction slanting upwards, so that while one edge of\r\nthe piece is buried three or four inches in the bed, the other is seen\r\npeeping through at the surface. Thus each flake of spawn is exposed to a\r\nslight difference of temperature, and, being thin and spongy enough to\r\nbe immediately impregnated with the moist warmth of the beds, takes\r\nquickly and well. As to any particular mode of inserting the spawn,\r\nlittle need be said; if the bed be beaten so hard as many recommend, and\r\nwhich I do not believe to be at all necessary, a dibber will be required\r\nto insert the spawn; if not, it may be readily inserted with a trowel or\r\nwith the hand. It is a good plan to use a mixture of two kinds of spawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Soil._\r\n\r\nAs regards the kind of soil used in earthing, it is not of nearly so\r\nmuch importance as is generally supposed; almost any soil will do; but\r\nthose having heaps of good maiden loam laid by for gardening purposes\r\nwill prefer to use a coating of that. I believe that any ordinary garden\r\nsoil would do, and feel certain that it is a mistake to bestow the least\r\ntrouble on procuring any particular kind of soil from a distance. The\r\nbeds in the caves around Paris are covered over with a white putty-like\r\nsubstance, which would be sufficient to shake the nerves of any British\r\nmushroom-grower accustomed to his coatings of mellow loam. It is simply\r\nthe fine rubbish from the stone breakage moistened, and smoothly and\r\nfirmly pressed over the beds. We, if shown this on a bed that had\r\nfailed, would assuredly attribute it to the “stuff” with which the bed\r\nwas covered, though finer crops than these little beds yield it would be\r\nimpossible to find. I notice this subject so that failures may be traced\r\nto their true causes, and not attributed to matters which really have\r\nbut slight influence. The final covering of from one to two inches of\r\nloam or other soil should not be applied till the spawn has begun to\r\nspread through the bed, but a very thin layer of dryish loam may be\r\nplaced on with advantage just after spawning has taken place, as it will\r\nserve to make the surface of a more equable temperature. It is a mistake\r\nto suppose that a deep covering is of any advantage. The final earthing\r\nshould be of soil sufficiently moist or moistened to permit of its being\r\npressed into a firm surface. However, unless it is exceptionally dry, a\r\nmere sprinkling of water will suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Watering._\r\n\r\nAs the materials of mushroom-beds are generally moist, and as but little\r\nevaporation can take place in the structures in which they are usually\r\ngrown, water is rarely necessary, and should not be applied until the\r\nsurface of bed and soil are really dry. It should then be given\r\ncopiously, enough to well moisten the bed, and it should be soft water\r\nheated to a temperature of 80 degrees given with a fine rose, and\r\nsteadily and patiently applied equably over the whole surface of the\r\nbed. Waterings that merely wet the surface and saturate the crevices or\r\nlower parts of the bed are of no use. If one drenching is not sufficient\r\nto moisten the bed properly, another should be given. The flat form of\r\nbed is of course much more easily watered, and is on the whole the best\r\nfor beds under cover. The position of beds will have a great influence\r\non the quantity of water they require, so that it is almost impossible\r\nto give precise directions on this head; but I can scarcely conceive a\r\ncase in which it will be necessary before six or eight weeks after the\r\nformation of a bed, and I have seen fine crops gathered without a single\r\nwatering having been given. In watering old beds one ounce of guano to\r\nthe gallon of water will prove beneficial.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Vermin in Mushroom Beds._\r\n\r\nWoodlice are the greatest pests the mushroom-grower has to dispose of,\r\nand the most effective way of getting rid of them is by destroying them\r\nwith boiling water. The surface of the bed being firm and covered with\r\nsmooth firm soil, the only likely place to afford these creatures the\r\ninterstices they usually retire into when disturbed, or when not\r\nemployed in eating the head of every little mushroom that presents\r\nitself, is round the edges of the bed, and in the slit which often\r\noccurs between the bed and wall or sides of the shelves that support it.\r\nThere they are likely to be found in great numbers, and may be destroyed\r\nwholesale by pouring boiling water all along the crack. If the beds be\r\ncovered with hay or litter, it will be necessary to remove this and\r\nallow them time to retreat into their hiding places; and if the beds are\r\nmade in any position that permits of the woodlice hiding in other places\r\nthan the interstices round them, these places should be sought out,\r\nmarked, and receive a searching dose of the scalding water all at the\r\nsame time. It need hardly be added that, as it is not mushrooms, but\r\ncreatures that rival ourselves in their love of mushrooms, that we wish\r\nto annihilate, the scalding water must not in any case be applied to the\r\nsurface of the bed. If on the surface of old or dry beds, or those from\r\nwhich a good many mushrooms have been cut or pulled, there are any loose\r\nhollows or crevices in which the woodlice can take shelter, they should\r\nbe sought out, cleared of vermin, levelled up, and made firm, so that\r\nthe enemy cannot take up a position in which we cannot attack him.\r\nShould this plan fail, half an ounce of sugar of lead, mixed with a\r\nhandful of oatmeal and laid in their tracks, will quickly destroy the\r\npests.\r\n\r\nThe small mite is most destructive in a high temperature, and in summer,\r\nMr. Cuthill says, “the maggot” will not breed in a house where the\r\ntemperature does not exceed sixty degrees, and it is in hot, dry, and\r\nhalf-neglected houses that this pest is usually seen in summer. At that\r\nseason there is little need to grow mushrooms indoors, and how they may\r\nbe produced otherwise in great abundance is explained further on. The\r\nentrance of rats should also be guarded against.\r\n\r\nMushroom-beds come into bearing about six weeks from the time of\r\nspawning, and remain in bearing from two to five months, according to\r\nthe position in which they are made, and the attention paid to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treatment of Old Beds._\r\n\r\nUpon the continuous bearing qualities of a mushroom bed a word may be\r\nsaid. It may savour of the ridiculous to say that a plant growing upon a\r\ndung bed may fail from the want of manure. Yet such is literally and\r\npositively the fact. Beds become worn out, the produce small and\r\nspindly, and we directly do away with them and make fresh ones. Instead\r\nof doing this, give the bed a thorough soaking of stable urine and\r\nwater, at the temperature of 80 degrees, using the urine in the\r\nproportion of one part to five of soft water, and adding a wineglassful\r\nof salt to each canful; then coat the bed with fresh sod, cover it down\r\nwith mats so as to promote the heating, and a second crop as good as the\r\nfirst may be obtained. In this matter I speak from experience, and Mr.\r\nIngram, at Belvoir, has followed the same plan for many years with the\r\nmost satisfactory result.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gathering the Crop._\r\n\r\nGatherings should frequently take place, especially where the culture\r\nis pursued on a large scale. Where there are several beds in bearing,\r\nthe mushrooms should be gathered every morning. In all cases they should\r\nbe pulled or twisted out, never cut out, so as to leave decaying stumps\r\nin the beds. The holes made by pulling out the mushrooms should be\r\nfilled with a little fine loam, of which a small heap may be kept in the\r\nhouse for this purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cleansing the House._\r\n\r\nA word as to the necessity of a thorough annual cleansing of the\r\nmushroom-house. The fact that the French cave-cultivators find it\r\nnecessary to shift from cave to cave, and find that after a cave has\r\nbeen in use a certain time, mushrooms cease to be produced in it, should\r\nact as a caution in this respect. In summer, when there is no need to\r\nattempt the culture indoors, the house should be thoroughly cleaned out,\r\nlime-whited, every surface scraped and washed, and the house freely\r\nopened, so as to thoroughly sweeten it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCULTURE IN SHEDS, CELLARS, ARCHES, OUTHOUSES, AND ALL ENCLOSED\r\nSTRUCTURES OTHER THAN THE MUSHROOM-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS may be, and are, grown to perfection in many less ambitious\r\nstructures than the mushroom-house proper. Any species of outhouse will\r\ndo for the autumn and early winter crops. One of the best crops I have\r\never seen was grown in a dry and unused coach-house. Mr. Robert Fish\r\ngrows all his crops in a long, low, rude thatched shed, open in\r\nfront--the beds flat, in a continuous line against a wall, and enclosed\r\nby a low board. Mr. Cuthill, who wrote on mushrooms, and who used to\r\ngrow them very well, grew his in rude sheds placed against walls. It\r\nmatters not in the least if the shed be open or ventilated here and\r\nthere, especially for autumn crops, as I have seen admirable crops in\r\nlow outhouses searched by every gust, and not heated by flues. The beds\r\nin these should always be covered with hay. Mushrooms may be grown in\r\ncellars; but cellars being commonly under houses, they are not exactly\r\nthe places to which people like to convey the materials necessary for\r\nthe making of mushroom-beds. Where they occur away from a\r\ndwelling-house, this objection will not hold good. In some cases it\r\nmight be obviated by making the beds in rough boxes, say 3½ ft. long\r\nby 1½ ft. wide, and afterwards introducing them into the cellar.\r\nRailway or other arches, or any dry and empty structures, may be used\r\nfor mushroom-growing.\r\n\r\n“The construction,” says Mr. William Ingram, of Belvoir, in a letter to\r\nthe _Field_, “of efficient mushroom-houses is sufficiently understood by\r\nmost of our hothouse-builders and by gardeners; but the economical\r\nadaptation of places which already exist is a matter which may with the\r\ngreatest advantage be discussed, as there are hundreds of persons about\r\nwhose establishments may be found outhouses, cellars, quarries, or\r\nsheds, capable of conversion into mushroom-houses, who would be very\r\nglad to be taught the method of growing mushrooms, and to have the\r\nsimple principles that should govern the construction of mushroom-houses\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n“There are few large farmsteads that are without an unconsidered place\r\nwhich could be readily adapted for the purpose of growing mushrooms; and\r\nfarmers possess the material at hand, horse manure, which would not\r\nsuffer great deterioration if employed in first raising a crop of\r\nmushrooms. Country brewing establishments have equal conveniences and\r\nopportunities. By relating the means by which I have been for several\r\nyears able to raise large quantities of excellent mushrooms, in a place\r\noriginally but ill adapted for the purpose, I may induce some of those\r\npersons who desire the luxury of what Soyer called ‘the Pearl of the\r\nFields,’ to turn their attention to the subject of their growth.\r\n\r\n“I had a large, open, airy shed at command, but it was liable to be\r\naffected by changes in the weather, and was altogether too draughty and\r\ncold in winter, and too hot in summer. I built within this shed, with\r\nrough fir boards, an inner shed, 18 ft. long, 6 ft. wide, and 8 ft. in\r\nheight; two receptacles for beds were formed, one on the floor, the\r\nother above it: and to give the requisite heat in winter, I passed a\r\nflue, formed of 9-in. socket pipes, through the house; with this I can\r\nalways command an adequate amount of heat. The material of which the\r\nbeds are formed is chiefly droppings, collected from an enclosed and\r\ncovered exercise ground. These droppings are trampled by the horses, and\r\nmixed with straw broken up with the manure by the passage of the horses.\r\n\r\n“When first collected it is piled up in a large heap, in a perfectly dry\r\nstate, and when wanted for the bed is thrown out, sprinkled with water,\r\nand fermented for about a week; while hot, it is taken to the house, and\r\nas it is thrown in is mixed with a small quantity of soil of a loamy\r\ncharacter, and a barrow-load of leaf soil. It is then pressed into as\r\ncompact a mass as possible by a rammer or mallet, building it up until\r\nit forms a bed 10 in. thick in front and 20 in. at the back. After a bed\r\nformed of this description of materials has been thus put together,\r\nrapid fermentation takes place; and when the most violent fermentative\r\naction has passed, and a temperature of 80° is found in the bed, spawn\r\nis put into it by means of a dibber. I employ brick spawn obtained from\r\ngood makers, but, to vary and possibly prolong the period of production,\r\nI introduce a certain quantity of spawn saved from old beds. This is\r\nlonger in its development than the made spawn, and appears as a\r\nsubsidiary crop. After the bed is spawned, a covering of compact loamy\r\nsoil is spread on the surface, 1½ in. to 2 in. in thickness, and well\r\nbeaten upon it so as to form a smooth and hard crust. A temperature\r\nranging from 50° to 60° should be maintained in the house. A lower\r\ntemperature abstracts the heat from the bed more rapidly.\r\n\r\n“When the mushrooms begin to exhibit weakness, as after the bed has\r\nproduced a certain quantity they will do, from the exhaustion of the\r\nmore stimulating portions of the manure, I find it an excellent practice\r\nto administer a sprinkling of water in which a handful of salt has been\r\nthrown (that quantity of salt to a three-gallon can). Saltpetre, though\r\nin much smaller quantities, is equally valuable given in the same way.\r\nThe practice I have described relates to the winter cultivation of\r\nmushrooms.”\r\n\r\nMany instances of perfect success like the preceding could be quoted.\r\nHere is one from Mr. W. P. Ayres:--\r\n\r\n“You will be glad to hear that we have on the outskirts of this town\r\n(Nottingham) a grower of mushrooms (Mr. Cookson, Mansfield Road) who\r\nvies with the French growers, especially if the means of growth be taken\r\ninto consideration. The place he occupies was formerly the pleasure\r\ngarden of a large hotel, where the proprietor would occasionally, in the\r\nsummer season, treat his friends and patrons to an _al fresco_\r\nentertainment. For this purpose a range of summer-houses was built,\r\nconsisting of brick arches, say 12 feet deep, 6 feet wide, and a little\r\nmore in height. Close adjoining is a small sandstone-rock cellar, which\r\nused to serve for drinkables in the summer and potatoes in the winter.\r\n\r\n“Some twelve months ago these premises and the house adjoining fell into\r\nthe occupation of a gardener, who, though he had a licence to the house,\r\nfancied he might turn the arches to a better purpose, and hence he\r\ndevoted them to mushroom beds. As it was necessary that the arches\r\nshould be closed, a wall about three feet high was built in the rudest\r\nmanner parallel with their front, but six feet from it, and from that a\r\nroof of rough timber was thrown, and covered with asphalted felt. Here,\r\nhowever, was a mistake; for, the building standing due south, when the\r\nsun fell upon it the atmosphere became rather ‘tarry’--so much so that\r\nthe mushrooms refused to grow in it. That wore off after a time, and\r\nfrom a bed not more than thirty yards square the tenant told me he had\r\ncut more than 25_l._ worth of mushrooms. When I saw the beds they might\r\nbe considered spent, the flush of early youth was over; but still the\r\ncrop was most wonderful, especially considering the means at command.\r\n\r\n“In the rock cellar the small beds were a pavement of splendid\r\nmushrooms, many of them as large over as a cheese-plate, and thick in\r\nproportion. In the garden is a barn--four walls with a roof over them,\r\nthe latter so rude that it was only in fair weather that it could be\r\ncalled waterproof. In this place which may be 25 ft. long by 15 ft.\r\nwide, two tiers of beds have been put up, the roof has been made\r\nwaterproof, a common brick flue put through it, and, at the time I saw\r\nthem, more promising beds could not be desired. Here again, you will\r\nperceive expensive appliances are not necessary for the production of\r\nmushrooms.”\r\n\r\nStables and like structures offer capital positions in which successful\r\nmushroom culture may be carried out with ease.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible, and we know it is not only possible but easy, to grow\r\nmushrooms in boxes a few feet long and a foot or eighteen inches wide,\r\nand the same depth, it is clear that there can be no difficulty about\r\ngrowing them in abundance in such a manner as that shown in the\r\naccompanying engraving. This mode was actually practised with great\r\nsuccess by the Baron Joseph d’Hoogvorst, of Limmel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. Mushroom culture on shelves in stable.]\r\n\r\nThe culture was carried out in neatly fitted-up wooden boxes, so\r\narranged that they might be shrouded with canvas curtains as shown in\r\nthe engraving, so that at first sight one would not suppose that\r\nmushroom culture was carried on there. No evil results as regards the\r\ncreation of an unhealthy atmosphere accompanied the attempt. The beds\r\nwere formed much in the usual way from the droppings of highly fed\r\nhorses. Now there can be no doubt that a similar mode of growing\r\nmushrooms could be carried out in the stables or some adjacent building\r\nin hundreds of places apart from the garden and the gardener altogether.\r\nGiven the materials and some position, however contracted, in which to\r\ncarry out the culture, and both these things are surely to be had almost\r\nin every place where there is a stable, the rest is so simple that any\r\nstableman or boy could carry it out. We know that these individuals, as\r\na class, are not much given to botanical or horticultural studies, but\r\nno doubt the prospect of an occasional half-dozen fresh mushrooms on the\r\ngridiron would give them most praiseworthy interest in the culture. The\r\nonly objection to it is, or might be, that once they were at home in the\r\nculture, the gardener would be very likely to fall short of materials\r\nfor his hotbeds. An empty loft, or any other covered structure could be\r\nemployed as well as the stable or an empty coach-house. Apart altogether\r\nfrom utilizing the walls of the stable, as the Baron did, empty stalls\r\nfrequently present an opportunity of growing mushrooms in quantity.\r\nThese remarks apply to stables in cities and towns, as well as in the\r\ncountry; indeed in cities, particularly in London, stable manure is\r\nusually so plentiful that it is much easier to obtain and much cheaper\r\nthan in the country, so that even those in London having suitable places\r\nfor growing mushrooms, but not keeping horses regularly or at all, could\r\nhave no difficulty in procuring abundance of materials.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. Mushroom-bed on rude shelf against wall of\r\ncellar.]\r\n\r\nThe French often cultivate mushrooms in cellars as well as in the caves\r\ndescribed in the next chapter. Preference should be given to a dry warm\r\ncellar; it should be as dark as possible, and exposed to no draughts.\r\nBeds can be made in cellars in many ways. Those made in the middle\r\nshould always be formed with two sides, while those against the walls\r\nshould only be half as thick, on account of their having only one useful\r\nside. It is also possible to arrange them on shelves, one above the\r\nother. For this purpose strong bars of iron are driven into the walls,\r\nupon which are placed shelves of the proper size covered with earth,\r\nupon which is formed a bed, that is treated exactly as those made upon\r\nthe ground. These beds are just as productive as any of the other\r\nkinds. They may even be made on the bottoms of casks, which should be\r\nat least two feet six in diameter; and they are built up in the shape of\r\na sugarloaf, about three feet in height, and the pieces of spawn are\r\nplaced an inch and a quarter deep, and sixteen inches apart. A barrel is\r\nsawn crossways into two pieces, each forming a tub. Holes are made in\r\nthe bottom of each, and a thin layer of good soil is spread over them\r\ninside. They are then filled with good well-prepared stable manure, just\r\nlike that used in the case of ordinary mushroom-beds, the different\r\nlayers of dung in each tub being well pressed down. When the tub is half\r\nfull, six or seven good pieces of spawn are placed on the surface, and\r\nthe remainder is piled up with manure, which is well pressed down, the\r\noperation being completed by giving to the heap the form of a dome. The\r\ntubs thus prepared are placed in a perfectly dark part of a cellar, and\r\neight or ten days afterwards the dung is taken up until the spawn is\r\nvisible, in order to see whether it has commenced to vegetate and\r\ndevelop little filaments. If the spawn has spread, the surface must be\r\ncovered with soil, care being taken to use only that which is fresh and\r\nproperly prepared. In this or any like way there should be no difficulty\r\nin growing mushrooms: the boxes or tubs could be filled anywhere, and\r\nthen carried into the spare cellars, &c. In this way objections against\r\nsteaming manure might in many cases be got over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. Pyramidal mushroom-bed on floor of cellar.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Mushrooms grown in bottom of old cask.]\r\n\r\nAmong the many and various structures in which mushrooms may be grown,\r\nbut which we rarely see utilized for that purpose, may be mentioned all\r\nkinds of greenhouses, stoves, pits, and frames. Some of the best crops I\r\nhave ever seen were in cold greenhouses almost too ruinous to grow\r\nanything else. In mid-winter the floors of all houses in which a genial\r\ntemperature is kept up for forcing or other purposes, offer excellent\r\npositions for producing mushrooms quickly and abundantly. Small\r\nridge-like beds might be made on the floor of these, and, with the\r\ngenial temperature usually kept up in such places, would probably come\r\ninto bearing a month or so after being spawned. How often, for example,\r\ndo we notice the floors of large vineries, in mid-winter or very early\r\nspring, quite bare, especially after the vines are started. Now just at\r\nthat season the genial heat that would be given off from the slightly\r\nfermenting materials used for the mushroom-bed is that which would be\r\nmost congenial to the tender breaking vines, and with a little attention\r\nin this way a first-rate crop of mushrooms could always be gathered from\r\nthe early vinery, and in houses where no artificial heat was applied\r\nthey could also be grown abundantly. A covering of hay would, however,\r\nbe necessary in cold houses in mid-winter, to prevent excessive\r\nvariation of the temperature, and also in spring and summer to prevent\r\nexcessive drying or scorching of the beds by a hot sun. I have even seen\r\nexcellent crops grown on the floor in an old lean-to house, the beds\r\ncovered with a foot or so of hay, occasionally sprinkled with water to\r\nprevent excessive heat on the surface of the bed. In small places where\r\nevery foot of space in the glass-house is likely to be occupied with\r\nplants, it is not easy to carry out the foregoing suggestions, but even\r\nif a small early vinery were occupied with plants, it would be desirable\r\nand practicable to introduce a series of rough boxes devoted to mushroom\r\nculture.\r\n\r\nApart from empty greenhouses altogether, the space beneath the stages in\r\nnumbers of glass-houses of every type may be utilized for the production\r\nof mushrooms. These positions are usually unoccupied, occasionally they\r\nare used for storing fuchsias, &c. in winter, but very seldom are they\r\nturned to so good account as they might be in the way I recommend. The\r\nstage in the small greenhouse is frequently elevated so that there is\r\nplenty of room to get beneath it: if at the back or end there is no way\r\nof walking readily under the stage, an opening should be made. The only\r\ndifficulty that could possibly occur would arise from the drip from the\r\nplants on the stage above. This, however, can be easily guarded against\r\nby spreading a piece of tarpaulin or oil-canvas over the bed or beds.\r\nWith beds properly made, a coat of dry hay or litter, and a piece of\r\ntarpaulin, every owner of anything in the shape of a greenhouse with a\r\nstage in it may grow mushrooms throughout the autumn, winter, and spring\r\nmonths, and even in summer by keeping the surface of the hay or litter\r\nmoist. Of course, if there be room for but one bed, a succession cannot\r\nbe kept up, and in this case a bed should be made in autumn, which, if\r\nwell managed, should be in full bearing for a month or six weeks before\r\nand after Christmas. There are, however, numerous spaces such as those\r\nalluded to where there is room to make a succession of beds. No person\r\nhaving but one greenhouse need fear much or any inconvenience from the\r\nodour of the manure--at least, not after the beds are earthed. The\r\ncouple of inches of soil over the manure would absorb any vapour given\r\noff by the bed.\r\n\r\nWherever the cultivation of cucumbers or melons in pits or frames is\r\ncarried out, nothing can be easier than to grow large crops of mushrooms\r\nafter the melons, &c. are cleared away. The spawn may be inserted over\r\nthe surface of the little mounds usually made for the reception of the\r\nyoung melon plants, and also over the remaining surface of the beds\r\nwhich are generally covered with a few inches of earth. After the melons\r\nhave done bearing and the haulm is cleared away, the spawn will usually\r\nbe found to have spread through the deep mass of earth in the beds. As\r\nlittle or no water is given or required while the melons are ripening, a\r\ngood soaking of tepid water will generally be necessary to encourage the\r\nmushrooms to start into profuse bearing. If the season and situation be\r\nmild and warm, the lights may be taken off; and if the sun be very\r\nstrong, the beds may be shaded with canvas or mats. If the season be\r\nlate and cold it will, on the other hand, be desirable to keep on the\r\nlights, and even to cover them in cold weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE CAVE CULTURE OF MUSHROOMS, NEAR PARIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE most extensive and successful culture of mushrooms in existence is\r\ncarried on in widely-ramifying caves far beneath the surface in the\r\nvicinity of Paris. To give the reader as good an idea of it as I can we\r\nmust visit one of the great “Mushroom caves” at Montrouge, just outside\r\nthe fortifications of Paris, on the southern side. The surface of the\r\nground is mostly cropped with wheat; but here and there lie, ready to be\r\ntransported to Paris, blocks of white stone, which have recently been\r\nbrought to the surface through coalpit-like openings. There is nothing\r\nlike a “quarry,” as we understand it, to be seen; the stone is extracted\r\nas we extract coal, and with no interference whatever with the surface\r\nof the ground. We find a “champignonniste” after some trouble, and he\r\naccompanies us across some fields to the entrance of his subterranean\r\ngarden. It is a circular opening like the mouth of an old well, but from\r\nit protrudes the head of a thick pole with sticks thrust through it.\r\nThis pole, the base of which rests in darkness sixty feet below, is\r\nthe easiest and indeed the only way by which human beings can get into\r\nthe mine. I had an idea that one might enter sideways and in a more\r\nagreeable manner, but it was not so. Down the shaky pole my guide\r\ncreeps, I follow, and soon reach the bottom, from which little passages\r\nradiate. A few little lamps fixed on pointed sticks are placed below,\r\nand, arming ourselves with one each, we slowly commence exploring dark,\r\nstill, tortuous passages. I have heard that the first individual who\r\ncommenced mushroom-growing in these catacomb-like burrowings was one\r\nwho, at a particularly glorious epoch of the history of France, when a\r\ngreat many more brave garçons went to fight than returned from the\r\nvictory, preferred, strange to say, to stay at home and hide himself\r\nrather than form a unit in “battle’s magnificently stern array.”\r\nIndustrious and discreet youth! You deserve being held up as an example\r\nas much as the busy bee that improves each “shining hour.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Mushroom-cave, 70 feet beneath the surface, at\r\nMontrouge, near Paris, July, 1868.]\r\n\r\nThe passages are narrow, and occasionally we have to stoop. On each hand\r\nthere are little narrow beds of half-decomposed stable manure running\r\nalong the wall. These have been made quite recently, and have not yet\r\nbeen spawned. Presently we arrive at others in which the spawn has been\r\nplaced, and is “taking” freely. The spawn in these caves is introduced\r\ninto the little beds in flakes taken from an old bed, or, still better,\r\nfrom a heap of stable manure in which it occurs naturally. Such spawn\r\nis preferred, and considered much more valuable than that taken from old\r\nbeds. Of spawn in the form of bricks, such as is used in England, there\r\nis none.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Newly-made bed against wall of cave.]\r\n\r\nThe champignonniste pointed with pride to the way in which the flakes of\r\nspawn had begun to spread through the little beds, and passed\r\non--sometimes stooping very low to avoid the pointed stones in the\r\nroof--to where the beds were in a more advanced state. Here we saw\r\nlittle, smooth, putty-coloured ridges running along the sides of the\r\npassages, and wherever the rocky subway became as large as a small\r\nbedroom two or three little beds were placed parallel to each other.\r\nThese beds were new, and dotted all over with mushrooms no bigger than\r\nsweet pea seeds, affording an excellent prospect of a crop. Each bed\r\ncontains a much smaller body of manure than is ever the case in our\r\ngardens. They are not more than twenty inches high, and about the same\r\nwidth at the base; while those against the sides of the passages are not\r\nso large as those placed in the open spaces. The soil, with which they\r\nare covered to the depth of about an inch, is nearly white, and is\r\nsimply sifted from the rubbish of the stone-cutters above, giving the\r\nrecently-made bed the appearance of being covered with putty.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are from seventy to eighty feet below the surface of the\r\nground, everything looks quite neat--in fact, very much more so than\r\ncould have been expected, not a particle of litter being met with. A\r\ncertain length of bed is made every day in the year, and as the men\r\nfinish one gallery or series of galleries at a time, the beds in each\r\nhave a similar character. As we proceed to those in full bearing,\r\ncreeping up and down narrow passages, winding always between the two\r\nlittle narrow beds against the wall on each side, and passing now and\r\nthen through wider nooks filled with two or three little beds, daylight\r\nis again seen. This time it comes through another well-like shaft,\r\nformerly used for getting up the stone, but now for throwing down the\r\nrequisite materials into the cave. At the bottom lies a large heap of\r\nthe white earth before alluded to, and a barrel of water--for gentle\r\nwaterings are required in the quiet, cool, black stillness of these\r\ncaves, as well as in mushroom-houses on the upper crust.\r\n\r\nOnce more we plunge into a passage as dark as ink, and find ourselves\r\nbetween two lines of beds in full bearing, the beautiful white\r\nbutton-like mushrooms appearing everywhere in profusion along the sides\r\nof the diminutive beds, something like the drills which farmers make\r\nfor green crops. As the proprietor goes along he removes sundry bunches\r\nthat are in perfection, and leaves them on the spot, so that they may be\r\ncollected with the rest for to-morrow’s market. He gathers largely every\r\nday, occasionally sending more than 400 lb. weight per day, the average\r\nbeing about 300 lb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. View in mushroom-cave.]\r\n\r\nA moment more and we are in an open space, a sort of chamber, say 20\r\nfeet by 12, and here the little beds are arranged in parallel lines, an\r\nalley of not more than four inches separating them, the sides of the\r\nbeds being literally blistered all over with mushrooms. There is one\r\nexception; on half of the bed and for about ten feet along, the little\r\nmushrooms have appeared and are appearing, but they never get larger\r\nthan a pea, and shrivel away, “bewitched” as it were. At least such was\r\nthe inference drawn from the cultivator’s expression about it. He\r\ngravely attributed it to a ridiculously superstitious cause. Frequently\r\nthe mushrooms grow in bunches or “rocks,” as they are called, and in\r\nsuch cases those that compose the little mass are lifted all together.\r\n\r\nThe sides of one bed here had been almost stripped by the taking away of\r\nsuch bunches, and it is worthy of note that they are not only taken out,\r\nroot and all, when being gathered, but the very spot in which they grew\r\nis scraped out, so as to get rid of every trace of the old bunch, and\r\nthe space is covered with a little earth from the bottom of the heap. It\r\nis the habit to do this in every case, and when the gatherer leaves a\r\nsmall hole from which he has pulled even a solitary mushroom, he fills\r\nit with some of the white earth from the base, no doubt intending to\r\ngather other mushrooms from the same spots before many weeks are over.\r\nThe “buttons” look very white, and are apparently of prime quality. The\r\nabsence of all littery coverings and dust, and the daily gatherings,\r\nsecure them in what we may term perfect condition. I visited this cave\r\non the 6th of July, 1868, and doubt very much if at that season a more\r\nremarkable crop of mushrooms could be anywhere found than was presented\r\nin this subterranean chamber--a mere speck in the space devoted to\r\nmushroom culture by one individual.\r\n\r\nWhen I state that there are six or seven miles run of mushroom-beds in\r\nthe ramifications of this cave, and that the owner is but one of a large\r\nclass who devote themselves to mushroom culture, the reader will have\r\nsome opportunity of judging of the extent to which it is carried on\r\nabout Paris. These caves not only supply the wants of the city above\r\nthem, but those of England and other countries also, large quantities of\r\npreserved mushrooms being exported, one house alone sending to our own\r\ncountry no less than 14,000 boxes annually. There were some traces of\r\nthe teeth of rats on the produce, and it need not be said that these\r\nenemies are not agreeable in such a place; but they did not seem to have\r\ncommitted any serious ravages, and are probably only casual visitors,\r\nwho take the first opportunity of obtaining more varied food than is\r\nafforded them by these caves. To traverse the passages any further is\r\nneedless--there is nothing to be seen but a repetition of the culture\r\nabove described, every available inch of the cave being occupied. We\r\nagain find our way to the bottom of the shaft, carefully mount the\r\nrather shaky pole one at a time, and again stand in the hot sun in the\r\nmidst of the ripe wheat.\r\n\r\nIn traversing the fields two things relating to mushroom culture are to\r\nbe observed--heaps of white gritty earth, sifted from the _débris_ of\r\nthe white stone, and large heaps of stable manure accumulated for\r\nmushroom growing, and undergoing preparation for it. That preparation is\r\ndifferent from what we are accustomed to give it. It is ordinary stable\r\nmanure, or very short stuff, not droppings, and is thrown into heaps\r\nfour or five feet high, and perhaps thirty feet wide. The men were\r\nemployed turning this over, the mass being afterwards stamped down with\r\ntheir feet, a water-cart and pots being used to thoroughly water the\r\nmanure where it is dry and whitish.\r\n\r\nAs many will feel an interest in the cave culture of the mushroom, and\r\nperhaps wish to see it for themselves, I may state that it is difficult\r\nto obtain permission to visit the caves, and many persons would not like\r\nthe look of the “ladder” which affords an entrance. Even with a\r\nwell-known Parisian horticulturist I had some difficulty in entering\r\nthem. I was informed that one champignonniste in the same neighbourhood\r\ndemands the exorbitant price of twenty francs for a visit to his cave.\r\nAs the visit is the work of some little time, no visitor should put the\r\ncultivators to this trouble without offering some slight recompense--say\r\nnot less than five francs. The above cave is but a sample of many in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of Paris.\r\n\r\nWe will next visit a mushroom-cave of another type at some little\r\ndistance from that city. It is situated near Frépillon,\r\nMéry-sur-Oise--a place which may be reached in an hour or so by the\r\nChemin de fer du Nord, passing by Enghien, the valley of Montmorency and\r\nPontoise, and alighting at Auvers. There are vast quarries in the\r\nneighbourhood, both for building-stone and the plaster so largely used\r\nin Paris. The materials are not quarried in the ordinary way by opening\r\nup the ground, nor by the method employed at Montrouge and elsewhere in\r\nthe suburbs of Paris, but so that the interior of the earth looks like a\r\nvast gloomy cathedral. In 1867 the mushroom culture was in full force at\r\nMéry, and as many as 3000 lbs. a day were sometimes sent from thence to\r\nthe Paris market; but the mushroom is a thing of peculiar taste, and\r\nthese quarries are now empty--cleaned out and left to rest. After a time\r\nthe great quarries seem to become tired of their occupants, or the\r\nmushrooms dislike the air; the quarries are then well cleaned out, the\r\nvery soil where the beds rested being scraped away, and the place left\r\nto recruit itself for a year or two. In 1867 M. Renaudot had the\r\nextraordinary length of over twenty-one miles of mushroom-beds in one\r\ngreat cave at Méry; last year there were sixteen miles in a cave at\r\nFrépillon. This is a clean, lonely village, just touching on the\r\ngigantic cemetery which M. Haussmann projected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. Entrance to large subterranean quarry.]\r\n\r\nThe distant view of the entrance to the quarries has much the appearance\r\nof an English chalk-pit. But there is a great rude arch cut into the\r\nrock, and into this we enter, meeting presently a waggon coming forth\r\nwith a load of stones, the waggoner with lamp in hand. To the visitor\r\nwho has seen the mushroom caves near Paris, where it is sometimes\r\nnecessary to stoop very low to avoid knocking one’s head against the\r\nroof rocks, the surprise is great on getting a little way in. At least\r\nit is so soon as one can see; the darkness is so profound that a few\r\ncandles or lamps merely make it more visible. The tunnel we traverse is\r\nnearly regularly arched, masonry being used here and there, so as to\r\nrender the support secure and somewhat symmetrical, the arches being\r\nflat at the top for six feet or so, and about twenty-five feet high;\r\nsometimes five feet higher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nPlan of large subterranean quarry at Fortes Terres, Frépillon. _S_, _S_,\r\n_S_, represent the plan of the bases of the huge supporting pillars, and\r\nthe dotted lines their union with the roof. _D_, _C_, shows the line of\r\nthe section shown in the following cut, and _P_, place for preparing the\r\nplaster. Sept. 1868.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Section following the line _C_, _D_, in Fig.\r\n22.]\r\n\r\nPresently we turn to the right, and a scene like a vast subterranean\r\nrock temple presents itself. At one end are several of us with lamps,\r\nadmiring the young mushrooms budding all over the rows of beds, which,\r\nserpent-like, are long and slim, and coil away into the darkness. At\r\nabout 150 feet distance there is a group of three men and a boy, each\r\nwith a lamp, again dispelling the darkness from the mushroom beds, and\r\noccupied in placing small quantities of a sort of white clayey sand in\r\nthe spots whence gatherings have been made a few hours previously. From\r\nboth sides of this gloomy avenue the dark openings of others depart at\r\nshort intervals, and the floor of all is covered with mushroom-beds,\r\nsometimes running along the passages, sometimes across them. These beds\r\nare about twenty-two inches high and as much in diameter, and are\r\ncovered with silver sand and a sort of white putty-like clay in about\r\nequal proportions. Running along in parallel lines, and disappearing\r\nfrom view in the darkness, one knows not what to compare them to, unless\r\nit be to barked pine trees in the hold of a ship.\r\n\r\nEverywhere on the surface of these little beds small mushrooms were\r\npeering forth in quantity; as the beds are regularly gathered from every\r\nday, no very large ones are seen. They are preferred when about the size\r\nof a chestnut, and are removed root and branch, a small portion of\r\nfinely sifted earth being placed in each hole, so as to level the bed as\r\nin the caves at Montrouge. If the old superstition that a mushroom never\r\ngrows after being seen by human eyes were true, the trade of a\r\nchampignonniste would never answer here, as the little budding\r\nindividuals come within view every day during the gathering and earthing\r\noperations. The most perfect cleanliness is observed everywhere in the\r\nneighbourhood of these beds, and the whole surface of each avenue is\r\ncovered by them, leaving passages of ten inches or a foot between the\r\nbeds. At the time of my visit (Sept. 29, 1868) the crops of the\r\ncultivator were reduced to their lowest ebb, and yet about 400 lbs. per\r\nday were sent to market. The average daily quantity from this cave is\r\nabout 880 lbs., and sometimes that is nearly doubled.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the cave the work of ripping out the stone by powder\r\nand simple machinery continually goes on. The arches follow the veining\r\nof the stone, so to speak; their lower parts are of hard stone, the\r\nupper ones of soft, except the very top, which is again hard. There is\r\nbut a slight crust of stone above the apex of each arch, and above that\r\nthe earth and trees.\r\n\r\nIt may be supposed that the profits from such an extensive culture are\r\ngreat; and so they are, but the expense is great also. The proprietor\r\ninformed me that culture on a more limited scale than he pursued last\r\nyear at Méry gave the best return in proportion to expense, the care and\r\nsupervision required by so many miles of beds being too great.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Extracting the stone in subterranean quarries.]\r\n\r\nAll the manure employed is brought from Paris by rail, as the place is\r\ntwenty-five miles from that city by road. In the first place, so much\r\nper month is paid in Paris for the manure of each horse; then it has to\r\nbe carted to the railway station and loaded in the waggons; next it is\r\nbrought to the station of Auvers, and afterwards carted a couple of\r\nmiles to the quarries, paying a toll for a bridge over the Oise on the\r\nway. That surely is difficulty enough for a cultivator to begin with!\r\nThen it is placed in great flat heaps a yard deep by about thirty long\r\nand ten wide, not far removed from the mouth of the cave, and here it is\r\nprepared, turned over and well mixed three times, and as a rule watered\r\ntwice. About five or six weeks are occupied in the preparation, long\r\nmanure requiring more time than short. The watering is not usually done\r\nregularly over the mass, but chiefly where it is dry and overheated.\r\nEvery day manure is brought from Paris; every day new beds are made and\r\nold ones cleared out--the spent manure being used for garden purposes,\r\nparticularly in surfacing or mulching, so as to prevent over-radiation\r\nfrom the ground in summer. The chief advantage the cultivator here has\r\nis the facility of taking his manure or anything else in or out in\r\ncarts, as easily as if the beds were made in the open air. Near Paris,\r\non the contrary, everything has to be sent up and down through shafts\r\nlike those of an old well, and the men have to creep up and down a rough\r\npole like mice. Many men are employed in the culture, the daily\r\nexamination of sixteen miles of beds being a considerable item in\r\nitself. Here and there a barrier in the form of straw nailed between\r\nlaths may be seen blocking up the great arch to a height of six feet or\r\nso. This is to prevent currents of air wandering about through the vast\r\npassages.\r\n\r\nThe mode of preparing the spawn here is entirely different to ours. They\r\nprefer virgin spawn--that is to say, spawn found naturally in a heap of\r\nmanure. But as this material cannot be obtained in sufficient quantity\r\nto meet the wants of such extensive growers, they put a small portion of\r\nit into a mushroom-bed to spread, and instead of allowing this bed to\r\nproduce mushrooms, it is all used as spawn, and is valued more than any\r\nother. Of course abundance of spawn occurs in the old beds, but it is\r\nnever used directly. It is, however, frequently employed to spawn a\r\nsmall bed when virgin spawn cannot be obtained. In this case the small\r\nbed devoted to the propagation of spawn is placed in the open air, and\r\ncovered with straw, and as soon as it is permeated with the spawn it is\r\ncarried into the caves and used. As the making and spawning of beds is a\r\nprocess continually going on, a bed of this sort must be ready at all\r\ntimes. It is never made into bricks as with us, but simply spread\r\nthrough short, partly-decomposed, manure.[A]\r\n\r\n[A] Mr. Speed, superintendent of the gardens at Chatsworth, has recently\r\nprepared his own spawn, as described on p. 73, and with perfect success.\r\n\r\nI was informed that coal-mines are not adapted for growing mushrooms,\r\nand the smallest particle of iron in the beds of manure is avoided by\r\nthe spawn, a circle around it remaining inert. It is said to be the same\r\nwith coal. If an evil-disposed workman wishes to injure his employer, he\r\nhas only to slip along by the beds with a pocketful of rusty old nails,\r\nand insert one here and there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. View in old subterranean quarries devoted to\r\nmushroom culture, and in the occupation of M. Renaudot. Sept. 29, 1868.]\r\n\r\nThe beds remain in good bearing generally about two months, but\r\nsometimes last twice and three times as long. A useful contrivance for\r\nfacilitating the watering of the beds has lately been invented; it\r\nconsists of a portable water-cistern to be strapped to the back and\r\nfitted with a rose and tubing, so that a workman may carry a larger\r\nquantity of water, and apply it more regularly and gently than with the\r\nold-fashioned watering-pots--while one hand is left free to carry the\r\nlamp. An iron frame has also been invented, in which the bed is first\r\ncompressed and shaped, the frame being then reversed and the bed placed\r\nin position. Another invention for earthing the beds over as soon as the\r\nspawn has taken will soon be in operation if not already so. As on an\r\naverage 2500 yards of beds are made every month, simple mechanical\r\ncontrivances to facilitate the operation will prove of the greatest\r\nadvantage to the cultivator.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the caves in the localities above alluded to there are\r\nother places near Paris where the culture is carried on--notably at\r\nMoulin de la Roche, Sous Bicêtre, near St. Germaine, and also at\r\nBagneux. The equability of temperature in the caves renders the culture\r\nof the mushroom possible at all seasons; but the best crops are gathered\r\nin winter, and consequently that is the best time to see them. I,\r\nhowever, saw abundant crops in the hottest part of the very hot season\r\nof 1868. These mushroom caves are under Government supervision, and are\r\nregularly inspected like any other mines in which work is going on. As\r\nregards the depth at which this culture is practised, it usually varies\r\nfrom twenty to one hundred feet, sometimes reaching one hundred and\r\nfifty and one hundred and sixty feet from the surface of the earth. They\r\nare so large that sometimes people are lost in them. In one instance the\r\nproprietor of a large cave went astray, and it was three days before he\r\nwas discovered, although soldiers and volunteers in abundance were sent\r\ndown. Is it possible that in a great mining and excavating country like\r\nours we cannot establish the same kind of industry?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCULTURE ON PREPARED BEDS IN THE OPEN AIR IN GARDENS AND FIELDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS may be grown with ease in the open air in gardens; and this is\r\na phase of the culture with which gardeners are not by any means\r\nsufficiently conversant. In fact, mushroom-culture in the open air in\r\nprivate gardens may be said not to exist at present, so very rarely is\r\nit seen.\r\n\r\nIn a little pamphlet on mushroom-growing that has lately appeared I find\r\nit stated that mushrooms may be grown out of doors “in summer,” but\r\nnothing about them being grown in the open air in winter. The Paris\r\ngrowers never attempt their culture in summer: the London ones very\r\nrarely. It is in winter that their cultivation is carried on in full\r\nvigour in the open air. Abundant crops are grown in the open air by the\r\nmarket-gardeners of London and Paris. From their beds mushrooms are\r\ngathered in quantities in mid-winter as well as in autumn. The Paris\r\nmarket-gardener does not attempt the culture in mid-summer, and does not\r\nthink it practicable; but in the hot summer of 1868, and in the midst of\r\nthe heats of July, I found about half an acre of ground at Brompton\r\ncovered with mushroom-beds bearing well.\r\n\r\nThe following illustration is from a sketch taken in Nov. 1869, in\r\nmarket-garden fields, between Kensington and Brompton. The beds, about\r\nthree and a half feet high and the same in width at the base, are\r\ncovered with the long straw or litter taken from the stable manure. Over\r\nthat is placed old bast mats, or any like materials, to keep the litter\r\nin its place, and throw off the rain; the mats being kept in place by\r\ntiles, bricks, old boards, or any like objects that may be at hand. This\r\nis well shown in my illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Mushroom-beds in market-gardens at Earl’s Court,\r\nKensington. November, 1869.]\r\n\r\nThe manure employed is that brought from the London stables, the longer\r\nlitter being shaken out and put on one side to cover the beds. No care\r\nwhatever is taken in the preparation of the manure; it is usually made\r\ninto beds soon after it is brought home and before it is allowed to\r\nheat, and then the beds are made in the form of potato-pits and beaten\r\nvery firm. The beds are spawned when at about a temperature of eighty\r\ndegrees, the pieces of spawn being placed about a foot or so apart, and\r\nit is then immediately earthed, the ordinary soil being used, and the\r\nbed covered to a thickness of a couple of inches. The success attained\r\nby the market-gardeners of both London and Paris, with the ordinary soil\r\nof the place in which the beds may be made, well proves the absurdity of\r\nseeking for any particular kind of soil for covering mushroom-beds. Beds\r\nmade in this way in the autumn and winter months, and covered with a\r\nthick layer of litter and mats, seldom require any watering. The culture\r\nis not usually attempted in summer; the heat acting upon the littery\r\ncovering giving rise to insects which destroy the mushrooms; but with\r\ncare their culture is quite practicable at that season; in proof of\r\nwhich I may say that during the last week of July, 1868, I saw them\r\ngathered freely in a market-garden just beside the Gloucester Road\r\nStation of the Metropolitan Railway, where by using a coating of litter\r\nabout a foot thick, and over that a layer of mats, it was possible to\r\nprocure them in good condition throughout the hottest summer within\r\nmemory. There are many acres of ground covered with beds made thus in\r\nthe market-gardens round London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Uncovered end of mushroom-bed in Paris\r\nmarket-garden. January, 1867.]\r\n\r\nWe will next turn to the culture of the mushroom in the open air near\r\nParis. In old times the market-gardeners there used to grow it amongst\r\ntheir ordinary crops with great profit, but since the champignonnistes\r\ncultivate it under no danger from cold in the caves, the\r\nmarket-gardeners, who used to raise it to a great extent in the open\r\nair, do so now in a less degree. They begin with the preparation of the\r\nmanure, and collect that of the horse for a month or six weeks before\r\nthey make the beds; this they prepare in some firm spot of the\r\nmarket-garden, and take from it all rubbish, particles of wood, and\r\nmiscellaneous matters; for, say they, the spawn is not fond of these\r\nbodies. After sorting it thus, they place it in beds two feet thick, or\r\na little more, pressing it with the fork. When this is done the mass or\r\nbed is well stamped, then thoroughly watered, and finally again pressed\r\ndown by stamping. It is left in this state for eight or ten days, by\r\nwhich time it has begun to ferment, after which the bed ought to be well\r\nturned over and re-made on the same place, care being taken to place the\r\nmanure that was near the sides of the first-made bed towards the centre\r\nin the turning and re-making. The mass is now left for another ten days\r\nor so, at the end of which time the manure is about in proper condition\r\nfor making the beds that are to bear the mushrooms. Little ridge-shaped\r\nbeds--about twenty six inches wide and the same in height--are then\r\nformed in parallel lines at a distance of twenty inches one from the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIn a market-garden they may stretch over a considerable extent, their\r\nlength being determined by the wants of the grower. The beds once made\r\nof a firm, close-fitting texture, the manure soon begins to warm again,\r\nbut does not become unwholesomely hot for the spread of the spawn. When\r\nthe beds have been made some days, the cultivator spawns them, having of\r\ncourse ascertained beforehand that the heat is genial and suitable.\r\nGenerally the spawn is inserted within a few inches of the base, and at\r\nabout thirteen inches apart in the line. Some cultivators insert two\r\nlines, the second about seven inches above the first. In doing so, it\r\nwould of course be well to make the holes for the spawn in an alternate\r\nmanner. The spawn is inserted in flakes about the size of three\r\nfingers, and then the manure is closed in over, and pressed firmly\r\naround it. This done, the beds are covered with about six inches of\r\nclean litter. Ten or twelve days afterwards the growers visit the beds,\r\nto see if the spawn has taken well. When they see the white filaments\r\nspreading in the bed they know that the spawn has taken; if not, they\r\ntake away the spawn they suppose to be bad and replace it with better.\r\nBut, using good spawn, and being practised hands at the work, they\r\nrarely fail in this particular; and when the spawn is seen spreading\r\nwell through the bed, then, and not before, they cover the beds with\r\nfresh sweet soil to the depth of about an inch or so. For cover, the\r\nlittle pathway between the beds is simply loosened up, and the rich soil\r\nof the market-garden applied equably, firmly, and smoothly with a\r\nshovel. With these open-air beds they succeed in getting mushrooms in\r\nwinter. A covering of abundance of litter is put on immediately after\r\nthe beds are earthed, and kept there as a protection. They have not long\r\nto wait till the beds are in full bearing, and when they are in that\r\nstate it is thought better to examine and gather from them every second\r\nday, or even every day where there are many beds. And thus they grow\r\nexcellent mushrooms, and in great quantity, all the further attention\r\nrequired being to renew the covering when it gets rotten, and an\r\noccasional watering in a very dry season.\r\n\r\nOf course this kind of cultivation is perfectly practicable in private\r\ngardens--where, however, I have not yet seen it carried out. Where there\r\nis a mushroom-house or empty shed in which mushrooms may be grown, there\r\nwould be less occasion to pursue it, but there are many places in which\r\nno such conveniences exist. In any case it is desirable that gardeners\r\ngenerally should know to what a large extent this phase of the culture\r\nis pursued round London and Paris, and how simply it is done. Instead of\r\nmats, it would be an improvement to cover the beds with tarpaulin or\r\nsome other cheap material that would keep out the wet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCULTURE IN GARDENS, ETC., WITH OTHER CROPS IN THE OPEN AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS is a phase of culture which may be pursued to great advantage in\r\nevery private garden, almost without cost and attention. The low\r\nridge-like hotbeds, for example, made for both long and short prickly\r\ncucumbers, gourds, marrows, &c., are admirably suited for growing a crop\r\nof mushrooms under the leaves of the subjects for which they were made.\r\nIf the spawn be inserted soon after the beds are made, or at any\r\nconvenient time in early summer, the beds will come into bearing in due\r\ncourse. Perhaps they may do so when mushrooms are found abundantly in\r\nthe fields; but there are thousands of persons possessing gardens who\r\nhave no fields in which to cull mushrooms, and who would like to gather\r\nthem fresh in summer or autumn, if they could not afford to grow them in\r\nany covered structure in winter. And this is but one way in which they\r\nmay be grown with summer garden crops, as will appear from the following\r\ncommunication, by Mr. Ayres, to the _Field_:--\r\n\r\n“The finest crop and the best mushrooms I ever saw were grown in the\r\nopen ground, and without any protection at all. I will tell you how it\r\nhappened. Some years back I had the charge of the garden of a noted\r\nhunting establishment in Northamptonshire, one of the aids to success\r\nbeing that the manure of an average of nearly fifty highly-fed horses\r\nwent to the garden, the owner remarking that, whatever other things I\r\nmight run short of, there would be plenty of ‘muck.’ Well, the best of\r\nthe hunters during the summer were soiled in loose boxes, principally\r\nunder cover, and in these boxes the manure was allowed to accumulate\r\nuntil it began to grow too hot for the feet of the horses; then it was\r\nindispensable that it should be removed. About midsummer it so happened\r\nthat nearly three acres of ground had been cleared of the spring crop,\r\nspinach, early peas, beans, &c., and I had determined to devote the\r\nwhole plot to winter brassicas, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, &c. The\r\nground was brashy and very poor, and consequently I determined to clear\r\nthe boxes and put the whole of the manure upon it. It was carted away so\r\nrich in ammonia that the men who loaded it shed tears, not from\r\nsentiment, but from compulsion; and when the manure was spread upon the\r\nsurface it was nothing less than a foot thick--so thick, that the\r\nproprietor said it was impossible for it to be dug into the ground.\r\nHowever, clearing a trench at one end of the piece, thirty inches wide\r\nand nearly a foot deep, the subsoil was broken up with strong steel\r\nforks, and upon that the dung covering the next strip was placed, and\r\ncovered with the surface soil of the next trench; and so the work\r\nproceeded until the manure was put out of sight. I may remark that the\r\ndung, especially that around the walls, contained evidence of being\r\nstrongly impregnated with mushroom spawn, though this was not regarded\r\nas being likely to produce a crop of the esculent. A soaking rain\r\nfalling, the ground was immediately planted with brassicas, which grew\r\nas if they could not help growing--and in fact they could not.\r\n\r\n“We had not planted for mushrooms, nor were mushrooms expected; but,\r\nwalking round one morning early in September, a bunch of splendid\r\nfellows presented themselves, so large and thick and solid, that when I\r\ntook them in for breakfast my _chef de cuisine_ and ‘better half’ had\r\ngrave doubts as to whether they were ‘the real thing.’ However, they\r\nwere eaten, and the present writing is a proof that they did not poison\r\nme. Returning to the plot, I found the bunch gathered was not a solitary\r\none--on the contrary, the ground was literally paved with mushrooms,\r\nmany of them so large that bushels were gathered for ketchup within a\r\nfew hours; while the retainers of a large establishment, down to the\r\nlowest labourer, were in a fortnight positively sick of them, and\r\ncartloads rotted upon the ground.\r\n\r\n“The evidence of this unexpected success demonstrated two things--first,\r\nthat if the ground is freely manured with _fresh_ dung from well-fed\r\nhorses, mushrooms are almost sure to be produced; and, secondly, that\r\nthe more the ground is covered with the foliage of plants, the more\r\ncertain will be the crop. Thus we found more mushrooms under savoys and\r\nbroccoli than under Brussels sprouts--the former no doubt protecting the\r\ncrop from heavy drenches of rain, which we know are very injurious to\r\nthe mushroom crop. Since this example of mushroom-growing turned up,\r\nnearly fifteen years ago, I have frequently concentrated the fresh\r\nmanure under a row of savoys or broccoli, throwing in at the same time a\r\ndust of mushroom spawn or the dung of a spent mushroom bed; and, except\r\nin very wet seasons, I have rarely failed to have a fine supply during\r\nthe months of September and October. One point of success I believe to\r\nbe essentially necessary, and that is, that water shall have a free\r\npassage through the ground at all times; hence the necessity of\r\ntrenching the ground, if you expect mushrooms as well as brassicas.”\r\n\r\nEven in gardens where mushrooms are well grown in enclosed structures\r\nsuch results in early autumn will often be desirable; while in numbers\r\nof places where there are few or no opportunities of gathering them in\r\nabundance under other circumstances, crops in the garden will be very\r\nwelcome. Therefore utilise the old mushroom-beds!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM CULTURE IN PASTURES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTWITHSTANDING the extreme abundance of the common mushroom in the\r\nmeadows and pastures of the British islands, and probably in similar\r\npositions all the world over, it is scarce in many situations, and, it\r\nmay be, not a few persons would be willing to make it of more frequent\r\noccurrence in their fields. There is an opinion not uncommon that this\r\ncannot be done; that the mushroom is, to a great extent, a creature of\r\nchance, and that it cannot be cultivated. This is not a philosophical\r\nnotion: there can be no doubt that the mushroom has to abide the results\r\nof the struggle for life as well as any other species of plant.\r\nConsidering that we have taken the spawn from the fields and cultivated\r\nit with great success in all sorts of positions, none of which it could\r\never inhabit naturally, it is absurd to suppose that we cannot induce it\r\nto grow in positions exactly similar to its native habitat. Found in\r\nopen, sunny meadows and pastures, and avoiding the shade of trees, it is\r\ngrown, as we have seen, in dark and deep mines; yet people suppose it\r\ncannot be grown in those pastures in which it happens not to be found.\r\nIt is erroneously inferred that there is something in its constitution\r\nor habit which causes it to occur in certain spots exclusively; but as\r\nwell might we say this of any other plant. We know well that hundreds of\r\nnative plants are hardy enough to grow almost anywhere, yet how many of\r\nthem are but locally distributed and rare! Again, many plants are weeds\r\nin one district and unknown in another, perhaps, neighbouring one.\r\n\r\nAs the Rev. M. J. Berkeley remarks:--“It is almost useless to advert to\r\nthe notion, though a very common one, which would regard these\r\nproductions as the creatures of chance or of a happy concurrence of\r\ncircumstances favourable to their growth from inorganic elements. It is\r\ntrue they often occur in unexpected situations, and from their extreme\r\nrapidity of development seem as if they could not have originated from\r\nanything like seed. But, as accurate inquiry has now thrown much light\r\non the mystery in which the origin of intestinal worms was lately\r\ninvolved, so the phenomena which attend the growth of fungi are\r\ngradually receiving light, and they are found to follow essentially the\r\nsame laws as more perfect vegetables.” It is, in fact, quite fair to\r\nconclude that mushrooms, like most other plants, occupy but a small\r\nspace in the vast expanse of soil and site which are naturally adapted\r\nfor their growth. I read in a gardening journal that “it is impossible\r\nto command a crop of out-door mushrooms.” I am positive that it can be\r\ndone with almost as much certainty as any other crop, provided we take\r\ninto consideration certain conditions. Of course, we must remember its\r\nnatural wants; the more we do so, the more certain of success we may be.\r\nWe know that it grows most abundantly in rich, upland pastures where\r\nwater does not lie, associated with the meadow foxtail, meadow and hard\r\nfescue and cock’s-foot grasses, clovers, cowslips, daisies, yarrow, &c.,\r\nand also with the thistles (_Cnicus lanceolatus_ and _C. arvensis_), and\r\nother plants fond of similar soils. We know that it is rarely found\r\nwhere the marsh plume-thistle (_Cnicus palustris_), tufted hair-grass,\r\nand other marsh grasses and plants abound, and from the presence or\r\nabsence of these plants we may easily make up our minds as to the\r\npositions that suit it best. Now, it has long since been proved in\r\ngardens that it is quite possible to cultivate plants to a much higher\r\ndegree of perfection than they ever attain in a wild state, under\r\nconditions entirely different, and it is not improbable that we should\r\nbe able to grow the common mushroom in soils and positions far removed\r\nfrom those in which it naturally occurs. But there is no occasion for\r\nanything of the kind. It loves well-drained and dry pastures and\r\nmeadows, and is not the country covered with such?\r\n\r\nAfter selecting the position in which we wish to propagate mushrooms,\r\nand no moderately dry pastureland need be without them, the next thing\r\nto consider is the providing of the spawn. Hitherto this has probably\r\nbeen the great difficulty. When nearly 20_l._ worth of mushroom spawn\r\nwas annually used in the mushroom-houses of a large garden, the expense\r\nnecessary to spawn a large pasture might well alarm the richest of\r\nmushroom-loving landholders; but there is not the slightest occasion for\r\npurchasing the spawn for this purpose. Every farmer and country\r\ngentleman can make it as easily as, or more easily than, the\r\nspawn-manufacturer, without any expense or inconvenience, the essential\r\nthing being a quantity of rather short stable-manure.\r\n\r\nWhere this is gathered in large heaps it will be easy to obtain the\r\nrequisite materials at once. Where it is not so, a few loads of stable\r\nmanure unmixed with long straw may be thrown together in the open air\r\nand prepared for the purpose. There is no occasion to place it in a shed\r\nof any kind, though if there be one at hand so much the better. If\r\nprepared in the open air it should be on a dry place; the materials\r\nshould be subjected to exactly the same preparation as when used for\r\nmaking a mushroom-bed, before described. They should be made into a\r\npotato-pit-shaped bed, and spawned in the usual manner. For this\r\nspawning it is of course necessary to obtain a little spawn, whether\r\nhome-made or bought from the seedsman, or found in what the French call\r\n“a virgin condition” in the dunghill. In any case it will not be found\r\ndifficult to spawn one or more beds in this way, particularly as there\r\nis nothing to prevent people drying as much home-made spawn at one time\r\nas will suffice for a year or more. The spawn should be allowed to run\r\nthrough this bed, which should be covered with a slight sprinkling of\r\nearth, and beaten pretty firm. When it has penetrated through the bed,\r\nit should, just before it arrives at a bearing condition, be ready to be\r\nused as spawn. The number of beds to be spawned in this way may be\r\nlimited according to the extent of ground on which it is proposed to\r\ngrow the mushrooms. This spawn may be inserted in the meadows in early\r\nsummer, the most suitable time is in genial weather in May, and the\r\nspawn should be inserted in holes from six to ten feet apart.\r\n\r\nThe most expeditious and best way of inserting it is that termed\r\nT-planting, striking the spade in the line represented by the\r\nperpendicular of the T, and then in the horizontal one on the top,\r\npressing the spade back when in the last position, so as to readily\r\nadmit of the insertion of one or more pieces of spawn. The kind of spawn\r\nmade as I have recommended usually falls into small pieces, more likely\r\nto impregnate the earth quickly than the stiff, brick-like pieces of\r\nnursery spawn. The ground, after the insertion of the spawn, should be\r\npressed firm with the foot. As to the depth at which the spawn should\r\nbe deposited, it would be better not to put it at any given depth, but\r\nso that while one piece of a flake may be at a depth of six inches or\r\nnearly so, others may touch the very surface. This, it need hardly be\r\npointed out, would allow of the spawn vegetating at the depth and\r\ntemperature most congenial to it. It would be most desirable to spawn at\r\nslightly different times, and, if possible, with different samples of\r\nspawn: thus, for example, it would be well to use a mixture of old and\r\ndried spawn with that taken fresh from one of the beds alluded to. If\r\nthis were not convenient, some part of the large bed of spawn might be\r\nlaid by to dry, and used a week or two afterwards. Probably the most\r\neconomical way of doing this on a large scale would be by employing a\r\nnumber of boys, guided by an experienced workman.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely desirable to attempt the culture in kept lawns, as no\r\nmatter how suitable these are for it, the appearance of a large crop of\r\nmushrooms would have anything but a tendency to beautify the carpet of\r\nturf, and would probably become offensive from their odour.\r\n\r\nThe preceding refers to the cultivation of mushrooms in pastures,\r\nmeadows, &c. There is not the slightest reason why a similar course of\r\nculture would not succeed in fields amongst green crops. As large crops\r\nof mushrooms have been produced in gardens under broccoli, &c., there is\r\nno reason whatever why they might not be grown in the same manner under\r\nfield-turnips, mangold-wurtzel, &c. The spawn which could be so easily\r\nprepared by any farmer, could be readily inserted in the sides of the\r\ndrills in which these crops are usually grown, the slight elevation of\r\nwhich, by preserving the spawn from excessive wet, will favour its\r\ndevelopment, and it would take possession of, and impregnate the manure\r\nin the drill. In fact, prodigious quantities might be raised in this and\r\nsimilar ways, with but little trouble; and should the fields be\r\nafterwards laid down, as is not uncommonly the case, the pasture or\r\nmeadow would probably become a regular mushroom-ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus campestris_ (True Meadow Mushroom).\r\n\r\nTHE common meadow mushroom varies considerably, but, “common to all are\r\na fleshy _pileus_, which is sometimes smooth, sometimes scaly, in colour\r\nwhite, or of different shades of tawny, fuliginous, or brown; _gills_\r\nfree, at first pallid, then flesh-coloured, then pink, next purple, at\r\nlength tawny-black; the _stem_ white, full, firm, varying in shape,\r\nfurnished with a white persistent ring; the _spores_ brown-black, and a\r\nvolva which is very _fugacious_.”--_Badham’s Esculent Funguses of\r\nEngland._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. _Agaricus campestris_ (the True Meadow\r\nMushroom). Pastures, autumn; colour, white or pale brown; gills, salmon,\r\nat length black; diameter, 3 to 6 inches. The spores are magnified 700\r\ndiameters.]\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any one in England who does not feel himself competent\r\nto decide on the genuineness of a mushroom; its pink gills easily\r\ndistinguish it from a kindred fungus, _Ag. arvensis_, the gills of which\r\nare of a flesh-coloured grey, and out of the pickings of ten thousand\r\nhands, a mistake is of rare occurrence; and yet no fungus presents\r\nitself under such a variety of forms, or such singular diversities of\r\naspect! The inference is plain; less discrimination than that employed\r\nto distinguish this would enable anyone who should take the trouble to\r\nrecognise at a glance many of those esculent species, which every\r\nspring and autumn fill our plantations and pastures with plenteousness.\r\nNeither is this left to be a mere matter of inference; it is\r\ncorroborated in a singular manner by what takes place at Rome; there,\r\nwhilst many hundred baskets of what we call toadstools are carried home\r\nfor the table, almost the only one condemned to be thrown into the\r\nTiber, by the inspector of the fungus market, is our own mushroom;\r\nindeed, in such dread is this held in the Papal States, that no one\r\nknowingly would touch it. “It is reckoned one of the fiercest\r\nimprecations,” writes Professor Sanguinetti, “amongst our lower orders,\r\ninfamous for the horrible nature of their oaths, to pray that one may\r\ndie of a _Pratiolo_;” and although it has been some years registered\r\namong the esculent funguses of Milan and Pavia (on the authority of\r\nVittadini), it has not yet found its way into those markets. Mr.\r\nWorthington G. Smith, in his “Mushrooms and Toad-stools,” qualifies this\r\nstatement of Dr. Badham.\r\n\r\n_Agaricus campestris_ is not generally appreciated in Italy, and indeed\r\nis seldom eaten, and never appears in the markets, for the simple reason\r\nthat there would be no sale for it. There is an edict in existence\r\nordering certain fungi to be thrown into the Tiber, but it is now, and\r\nhas long been altogether effete; and whilst there is an abundance of _A.\r\nCæsareus_ (avowedly the most delicious of all fungi) for the markets of\r\nItaly, it is not to be expected the consumption will be given up for\r\nanother and little known species.\r\n\r\n_The Modes of Cooking this Species._--“The mushroom, having the same\r\nproximate principles as meat, requires, like meat, to be cooked before\r\nthese become changed. The _Ag. campestris_ may be prepared in a great\r\nvariety of ways: they give a fine flavour to soup, and greatly improve\r\nbeef-tea; where arrowroot and weak broths are distasteful to the\r\npatient, the simple seasoning of a little ketchup will frequently form\r\nan agreeable change. Some roast them, basting with melted butter and\r\nwhite (French) wine sauce. In patties and _vols-au-vent_ they are\r\nequally excellent; in fricassees, as everybody knows, they are the\r\nimportant element of the dish. Roques recommends in all cases the\r\nremoval of the gills before dressing, which though it secures a more\r\nelegant-looking _entremets_, is only flattering the eye at the expense\r\nof the palate.”--_Badham._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus arvensis_ (Horse-Mushroom).\r\n\r\n“_Pileus_ fleshy, obtusely conico-campanulate, then expanded, at first\r\nfloccose, then smooth, even, or rivulose; _stem_ hollow, with a floccose\r\npith; _ring_ broad, pendulous, double, the outer split in rays; _gills_\r\nfree, wider in front, at first dirty white, then brown, tinged with\r\npink.”--_Berkeley’s Outlines of British Fungology._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. _Agaricus arvensis_ (Horse-Mushroom). Pastures,\r\nin autumn; colour, yellowish; gills pallid, at length black; diameter, 6\r\nto 24 in.]\r\n\r\n“This species is very nearly allied to the meadow mushroom, and\r\nfrequently grows with it, but it is coarser, and has not the delicious\r\nflavour. It is usually much larger, often attaining enormous dimensions;\r\nit turns a brownish yellow as soon as broken or bruised. The top in good\r\nspecimens is smooth, and snowy white; the gills are not the pure pink of\r\nthe meadow mushroom, but dirty brownish white, ultimately becoming\r\nbrown-black. It has a big, ragged, floccose ring, and the pithy stem is\r\ninclined to be hollow. It is _the_ species exposed for sale in Covent\r\nGarden Market. Indeed, after knowing the market for many years, I have\r\nrarely seen any other species there; when the true mushroom, however,\r\n_is_ there, it is frequently mingled with horse mushrooms, which seems\r\nto show that the dealers do not know one from the other. In the wet days\r\nof autumn, children, idlers, and beggars go a few miles from town into\r\nthe meadows to gather whatever they can find in the mushroom line; they\r\nthen bring their dirty stock to market, where it is sold to fashionable\r\npurchasers; stale, vapid, and without taste--unless it be a bad one.\r\n\r\n“When young and fresh, the horse mushroom is a most desirable addition\r\nto the bill of fare: it yields an abundant gravy, and the flesh is firm\r\nand delicious. It is a valuable plant when freshly gathered, but when\r\nstale it becomes tough and leathery, and without aroma or juice.\r\n\r\n“There is a curious, large, brown, hairy variety, of rather uncommon\r\noccurrence, similar to the hairy variety of the meadow mushroom, the _A.\r\nvillaticus_ of Dr. Badham. It is a splendid form, but, I think, very\r\nrare. I have only seen it once.\r\n\r\n“Many country-folk readily distinguish the meadow from the horse\r\nmushroom, and show antipathy to the latter, although they are always\r\nwilling to put it into the jar as one of the ingredients of ketchup.\r\nOpinions appear to differ greatly regarding the excellence of this\r\nspecies. Mr. Penrose writes:--‘I think young, and especially button,\r\nspecimens of this very indigestible; until they are well opened out,\r\nthey are unfit for use.’ Such, however, I must say, is not my experience\r\nof button specimens.\r\n\r\n“There is a strong odour attached both to the fungus and the spawn, the\r\nground just below the surface being frequently white with the latter; or\r\nif horse-dung be kicked aside in a rich meadow frequented by\r\ngraminivorous animals, the earth will frequently present a snowy\r\nwhiteness from the spawn of this species, from which the young\r\nindividuals may be seen springing up.\r\n\r\n“I once saw a sheep eat a large specimen with great apparent gusto,\r\nalthough the fungus was full of maggots.”--_Worthington G. Smith._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nMODES OF COOKING THE COMMON MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following modes of cooking mushrooms may prove useful to some:--\r\n\r\n_To Stew Mushrooms._--Trim and rub clean half a pint of large button\r\nmushrooms; put into a stew-pan two ounces of butter, shake it over the\r\nfire till thoroughly melted; put in the mushrooms, a tea-spoonful of\r\nsalt, half as much pepper, and a blade of mace pounded; stew till the\r\nmushrooms are tender, then serve them on a hot dish. They are usually\r\nsent in as a breakfast dish, thus prepared in butter.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms à la Crême._--Trim and rub half a pint of button mushrooms,\r\ndissolve two ounces of butter rolled in flour in a stew-pan; then put in\r\nthe mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, a tea-spoonful of salt, half a\r\ntea-spoonful each of white pepper and of powdered sugar, shake the pan\r\nround for ten minutes, then beat up the yolks of two eggs, with two\r\ntable-spoonfuls of cream, and add by degrees to the mushrooms; in two or\r\nthree minutes you can serve them in the sauce.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms on Toast._--Put a pint of mushrooms into a stew-pan, with two\r\nounces of butter rolled in flour; add a tea-spoonful of salt, half a\r\ntea-spoonful of white pepper, a blade of mace powdered, and half a\r\ntea-spoonful of grated lemon; stew till the butter is all absorbed, then\r\nadd as much white _roux_ as will moisten the mushrooms; fry a slice of\r\nbread in butter, to fit the dish, and as soon as the mushrooms are\r\ntender serve them on the toast.\r\n\r\n_To Pot Mushrooms._--The small open mushrooms suit best for potting.\r\nTrim and rub them; put into a stew-pan a quart of mushrooms, three\r\nounces of butter, two tea-spoonfuls of salt, and half a tea-spoonful of\r\nCayenne and mace mixed, and stew for ten or fifteen minutes, or till the\r\nmushrooms are tender; take them carefully out and drain them perfectly\r\non a sloping dish, and when cold press them into small pots, and pour\r\nclarified butter over them, in which state they will keep for a week or\r\ntwo. If required to be longer preserved, put writing paper over the\r\nbutter, and over that melted suet, which will effectually preserve them\r\nfor many weeks, if kept in a dry, cool place.\r\n\r\n_To Pickle Mushrooms._--Select a number of small, sound, pasture\r\nmushrooms as nearly as possible alike in size; throw them for a few\r\nminutes into cold water; then drain them; cut off the stalks, and gently\r\nrub off the outer skin with a moist flannel dipped in salt; then boil\r\nthe vinegar, adding to each quart two ounces of salt, half a nutmeg\r\nsliced, a drachm of mace, and an ounce of white pepper-corns; put the\r\nmushrooms into the vinegar for ten minutes over the fire; then pour the\r\nwhole into small jars, taking care that the spices are equally divided;\r\nlet them stand a day, then cover them.\r\n\r\n_Another Method._--In pickling mushrooms take the buttons only and while\r\nthey are quite close, cut the stem off even with the gills and rub them\r\nquite clean. Lay them in salt and water for forty-eight hours, and then\r\nadd pepper, and vinegar in which black pepper and a little mace have\r\nbeen boiled. The vinegar must be applied cold. So pickled they will keep\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms en Ragoût._--Put into a stew-pan a little stock, a small\r\nquantity of vinegar, parsley, and green onions chopped up, salt, and\r\nspices. When this is about to boil, the mushrooms being cleaned, put\r\nthem in. When done remove them from the fire, and thicken with yolks of\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms and Toast._--Peel the mushrooms, and take out the stems. Fry\r\nthem over a quick fire. When the butter is melted take off the pan.\r\nSqueeze the juice of a lemon into it. Let the mushrooms fry again for\r\nsome minutes. Add salt, pepper, spices, and a spoonful of water, in\r\nwhich a clove of garlic, having been cut into pieces, has soaked for\r\nhalf an hour; let it stew. When the mushrooms are done, make a\r\nthickening of yolks of eggs. Pour the mushrooms on bread fried in\r\nbutter, and laid in the dish ready for them.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms en Caisse._--Peel the mushrooms lightly, and cut them into\r\npieces. Put them into cases of buttered paper, with a bit of butter,\r\nparsley, green onions, and shalots chopped up, salt and pepper. Dress\r\nthem on the gridiron over a gentle fire, and serve in the cases.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms à la Provençale._--Take mushrooms of good size. Remove the\r\nstems, and soak them in olive oil. Cut up the stems with a clove of\r\ngarlic and some parsley. Add meat of sausages, and two yolks of eggs to\r\nunite them. Dish the mushrooms, and garnish them with the forcemeat.\r\nSprinkle them with fine oil, and dress them in an oven, or in a _four de\r\ncampagne_.\r\n\r\n_Baked Mushrooms._--Peel the tops of twenty mushrooms; cut off a portion\r\nof the stalks, and wipe them carefully with a piece of flannel dipped in\r\nsalt. Lay the mushrooms in a tin dish, put a small piece of butter on\r\nthe top of each, and season them with pepper and salt. Set the dish in\r\nthe oven, and bake them from twenty minutes to half an hour. When done,\r\narrange them high in the centre of a very hot dish, pour the sauce round\r\nthem, and serve quickly, and as hot as you possibly can.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms au Gratin._--Take twelve large mushrooms about two inches in\r\ndiameter, pare the stalks, wash, and drain the mushrooms on a cloth; cut\r\noff and chop the stalks. Put in a quart stew-pan an ounce of butter and\r\nhalf an ounce of flour; stir over the fire for two minutes; then add one\r\npint of broth; stir till reduced to half the quantity. Drain the chopped\r\nstalks of the mushrooms thoroughly in a cloth; put them in the sauce\r\nwith three table-spoonfuls of chopped and washed parsley, one\r\ntable-spoonful of chopped and washed shalot, two pinches of salt, a\r\nsmall pinch of pepper; reduce on a brisk fire for eight minutes, put two\r\ntable-spoonfuls of oil in a _sauté_ pan; set the mushrooms in, the\r\nhollow part upwards; fill them with the fine herbs, and sprinkle over\r\nthem lightly a table-spoonful of raspings; put in a brisk oven for ten\r\nminutes, and serve.\r\n\r\n_Mushroom Soup._--Take a good quantity of mushrooms, cut off the earthy\r\nend, and pick and wash them. Stew them with some butter, pepper, and\r\nsalt in a little good stock till tender; take them out, and chop them up\r\nquite small; prepare a good stock as for any other soup, and add it to\r\nthe mushrooms and the liquor they have been stewed in. Boil all\r\ntogether, and serve. If white soup be desired, use the white button\r\nmushrooms, and a good veal stock, adding a spoonful of cream or a little\r\nmilk, as the colour may require.\r\n\r\nThe following “family receipts” have been communicated by a friend:\r\n\r\nClean a dozen or so of medium-size, place two or three ounces of nice\r\nclean beef-dripping in the frying-pan, and with it a table-spoonful or\r\nmore of nice beef gravy. Set the pan on a gentle fire, and as the\r\ndripping melts place in the mushrooms, adding salt and pepper to taste.\r\nIn a few minutes they will be cooked, and being soaked in the gravy and\r\nserved upon a hot plate, will form a capital dish. In the absence of\r\ngravy, a _soupçon_ of “extractum carnis” may be substituted.\r\n\r\n_Mushrooms with Bacon._--Take some full-grown mushrooms, and having\r\ncleaned them, procure a few rashers of nice streaky bacon, and fry it in\r\nthe usual manner. When nearly done, add a dozen or so of mushrooms, and\r\nfry them slowly until they are cooked. In this process they will absorb\r\nall the fat of the bacon, and with the addition of a little salt and\r\npepper, will form a most appetising breakfast relish.\r\n\r\n_Mushroom Stems_, if young and fresh, make a capital dish for those who\r\nare not privileged to eat the mushrooms. Rub them quite clean, and after\r\nwashing them in salt and water, slice them to the thickness of a\r\nshilling, then place them in a saucepan with sufficient milk to stew\r\nthem tender; throw in a piece of butter and some flour for thickening,\r\nand salt and pepper to taste. Serve upon a toast of bread, in a hot\r\ndish, and add sippets of toasted bread. This makes a light and very\r\ndelicate supper dish, and is not bad sauce to a boiled fowl.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nSOME OF THE MOST COMMON AND USEFUL EDIBLE FUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Whole hundredweights of rich, wholesome diet rotting under\r\n    the trees; woods teeming with food, and not one hand to gather\r\n    it; and this, perhaps, in the midst of potato-blight, poverty,\r\n    and all manner of privations, and public prayers against\r\n    imminent famine.”\r\n                                                     _Dr. Badham._\r\n\r\nVALUABLE as is the common mushroom, it is indisputable that not a few\r\nother kinds are also capable of affording excellent food. Therefore,\r\nfigures are given of the most prevalent, useful, and easily recognised\r\nkinds of edible fungi, as well as of the common mushrooms of our gardens\r\nand markets. These figures have been admirably drawn by Mr. W. G. Smith,\r\nand are accompanied by what seemed the most satisfactory accounts of the\r\ncharacters and properties that are obtainable. The spores which\r\naccompany the figures are uniformly enlarged seven hundred diameters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius oreades_ (Fairy-ring Champignon).\r\n\r\n_Pileus_ smooth, fleshy, convex, subumbonate, generally more or less\r\ncompressed, tough, coriaceous, elastic, wrinkled; when water-soaked,\r\nbrown; when dry, of a buff or cream-colour, the umbo often remaining\r\nred-brown, as if scorched; _gills_ free, distant, ventricose, of the\r\nsame tint as the pileus, but more pale; _stem_ equal, solid, twisted,\r\nvery tough and fibrous, of a pale silky-white colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30--1. _Marasmius oreades_ (Fairy-ring Champignon).\r\nPastures, roadsides, and downs, in the autumn; colour, pale buff; _gills\r\nbroad and far apart_; diameter, 1 to 2 inches.\r\n\r\nFig. 30--2. _Marasmius urens_ (False Champignon). Woods and pastures in\r\nthe autumn; colour, pale buff; _gills narrow and crowded together_;\r\ndiameter, ½ inch to 1½ inches.]\r\n\r\nThe fairy-ring agaric is a valuable little fungus, and common on almost\r\nevery lawn. In hilly pastures it generally appears in broad brown\r\npatches, either circular or forming a portion of a circle.\r\n\r\n_M. urens_, the most acrid of all allied funguses, usually grows in\r\nwoods, though sometimes in the fairy-ring. However, its flat top and\r\nnarrow crowded gills cause it to be readily distinguished anywhere.\r\n\r\n_Opinions on the Merits of Marasmius oreades as an edible Fungus._--“On\r\nthe Continent this species has long been considered edible, but on\r\naccount of its coriaceous texture it is dried and employed in the form\r\nof powder, to season various made-dishes.”--_Dr. Greville._\r\n\r\n“The common fairy-ring champignon is the best of all our funguses, yet\r\nthere is scarcely one person in a thousand who dare venture to use it.\r\nWith common observation no mistake need be made with regard to it. It\r\nhas an extremely fine flavour, and makes perhaps the very best ketchup\r\nthat there is.”--_Rev. M. J. Berkeley._\r\n\r\n“An excellent flavour, as good as that of most funguses.”--_Dr. Badham._\r\n\r\n_Modes of Cooking Marasmius oreades._--_General Use._--“Cut in small\r\npieces and seasoned it makes an excellent addition to stews, hashes, or\r\nfried meats, but it should only be added a few minutes before serving,\r\nas the aroma is dissipated by over cooking. It is the mushroom used in\r\nthe French _à la mode_ beef-shops in London.”--_Dr. Badham._\r\n\r\nWhen stewed, the champignons require rather longer time to ensure their\r\nbeing made perfectly tender. They are readily dried by removing the\r\nstems from the fungus, threading them on a string, and hanging them up\r\nin a dry airy place. “When dried, it may be kept for years without\r\nlosing any of its aroma or goodness, which, on the contrary, becomes\r\nimproved by the process, so as, in fact, to impart more flavour to the\r\ndish than would have been imparted by the fresh fungus; though it is not\r\nto be denied that the flesh then becomes coriaceous (or tough), and less\r\neasy of digestion.”--_Dr. Badham._\r\n\r\n_Champignon Powder._--Put the champignons in a stew-pan with a little\r\nmace and a few cloves, and a sprinkling of white pepper. Simmer, and\r\nshake constantly to prevent burning, until any liquor that may exude is\r\ndried up again. Dry thoroughly in a warm oven until they will easily\r\npowder. Put the dried agaric, or the powder, into wide-mouthed glass\r\nbottles, and store in a dry place. It will keep any length of time. A\r\ntea-spoonful added to any soup, or gravy, or sauce, just before the last\r\nboil is given, will produce a very fine mushroom flavour.\r\n\r\n_Pickled Champignons._--Collect fresh buttons of the fairy-ring agaric\r\nand use them at once. Cut off the stems quite close and throw each one\r\nas you do so into a basin of water in which a spoonful of salt has been\r\nput. Drain them from it quickly afterwards, and place them on a soft\r\ncloth to dry. For each quart of buttons thus prepared, take nearly a\r\nquart of pale white wine vinegar, and add to it a heaped tea-spoonful of\r\nsalt, half an ounce of whole white pepper, an ounce of ginger-root\r\nbruised, two large blades of mace, and a fourth of a salt-spoon of\r\ncayenne pepper tied in a small piece of muslin. When this pickle boils\r\nthrow in the agarics and boil them in it over a clear fire moderately\r\nfast, from six to nine minutes. When tolerably tender put them into\r\n_warm_ wide-mouthed bottles, and divide the spice equally amongst them.\r\nWhen perfectly cold, cork well, or tie skins and paper over them. Store\r\nin a dry place, and keep out the frost.\r\n\r\nFull-sized champignons may be pickled exactly in the same way, but will\r\nrequire longer boiling, until indeed they become tender.--_Modified from\r\nMiss Acton._\r\n\r\n_Champignons quickly Pickled._--Place the prepared buttons in bottles\r\nwith a blade of mace, a tea-spoonful of pepper-corns, and a tea-spoonful\r\nof mustard seed in each, and cover with the strongest white wine\r\npickling vinegar boiling hot. Cork or tie down as before, but do not\r\nexpect them to keep above three months.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus procerus_ (the Parasol Agaric).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. _Agaricus procerus_ (Scaly Mushroom). Pastures,\r\n&c., in autumn; colour, pale brownish buff; diameter, 5 to 12 inches.]\r\n\r\n_Pileus_ fleshy, ovate when young, then campanulate, and afterwards\r\nexpanded and umbonate (blunt pointed), from three to seven inches\r\nacross. Cuticle more or less brown, entire over the umbo, but torn into\r\npatches, or scales which become more and more separated as they approach\r\nthe margin. Flesh white. _Gills_ unconnected with the stem, fixed to a\r\ncollar on the pileus surrounding its top. _Ring_ persistent, loose on\r\nthe stem. _Stem_ six or eight inches high, tapering upwards from a\r\npear-like bulb at the root, hollow with a loose pith, whitish brown,\r\nbut more or less variegated with small and close-pressed scales.\r\n\r\nWhenever an agaric on _a long stalk_, enlarged _at the base_, presents\r\n_a dry cuticle_ more or less _scaly_, a darker coloured _umbonated top_,\r\n_a moveable ring_, and _white_ gills, it must be _Agaricus procerus_,\r\nthe parasol agaric, and it may be gathered and eaten without fear. When\r\nthe whitish flesh of this agaric is bruised it shows a light reddish\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nThere are but two other agarics that at all resemble it, and both are\r\nedible. One about the same size is _Agaricus rachodes_. It is not\r\ngenerally considered so good in flavour as _A. procerus_. Mrs. Hussey,\r\nhowever, says plainly, “If _Agaricus procerus_ is the king of edible\r\nfunguses, _Agaricus rachodes_ is an excellent viceroy.” The other is the\r\n_Agaricus excoriatus_, a very much smaller fungus, with a more slender\r\nhabit, a shorter stem, and no true bulb at the base. This elegant little\r\nfungus is also very good eating.\r\n\r\nThe parasol agaric has a very wide range of growth. It is a common\r\nfungus, and is in _high request all over the Continent_.\r\n\r\n_Opinions on the Merits of Agaricus procerus as an Edible Fungus._--“A\r\nmost excellent mushroom, of a delicate flavour, and it must be\r\nconsidered a most useful species.”--_The Rev. M. J. Berkeley._\r\n\r\n“Were its excellent qualities better known here, they could not fail to\r\nsecure it a general reception into our best kitchens, and a frequent\r\nplace among our side dishes at table.”--_Dr. Badham._\r\n\r\n“If once tried, it must please the most fastidious.”--_Worthington G.\r\nSmith._\r\n\r\nThere can be no question but that, when young and quickly grown, the\r\nparasol agaric is a delicious fungus. It has a light and delicate\r\nflavour without the heavy richness which belongs to the ordinary field\r\nmushroom. The writer has prevailed on many persons to try it; all\r\nwithout exception have liked it, many have thought it quite equal, and\r\nsome have proclaimed it superior, to the common mushroom.\r\n\r\n_Modes of Cooking the Agaricus procerus._--_Broiled Procerus._--Remove the\r\nscales and stalks from the agarics, and broil lightly over a clear fire\r\non both sides for a few minutes; arrange them on a dish over fresh-made,\r\nwell-divided toast; sprinkle with pepper and salt, and put a small piece\r\nof butter on each; set before a brisk fire to melt the butter, and serve\r\nup quickly.\r\n\r\nIf the cottager would toast his bacon over the broiled mushrooms, the\r\nbutter would be saved.\r\n\r\n_Agarics delicately Stewed._--Remove the stalks and scales from young\r\nhalf-grown agarics, and throw each one as you do so into a basin of\r\nfresh water slightly acidulated with the juice of a lemon, or a little\r\ngood vinegar. When all are prepared, remove them from the water, and\r\nput them into a stew-pan with a very small piece of fresh butter.\r\nSprinkle with white pepper and salt, and add a little lemon-juice; cover\r\nup closely, and stew for half an hour. Then add a spoonful of flour,\r\nwith sufficient cream, or cream and milk, until the whole has the\r\nthickness of cream. Season to taste, and stew again gently until the\r\nagarics are perfectly tender. Remove all the butter from the surface,\r\nand serve in a hot dish, garnished with slices of lemon.\r\n\r\nA little mace, nutmeg, or ketchup may be added; but there are those who\r\nthink that spice spoils the mushroom flavour.\r\n\r\n_Cottager’s Procerus Pie._--Cut fresh agarics in small pieces, and cover\r\nthe bottom of a pie-dish. Pepper, salt, and place them on small shreds\r\nof fresh bacon, then put in a layer of mashed potatoes, and so fill the\r\ndish, layer by layer, with a cover of mashed potatoes for the crust.\r\nBake well for half an hour, and brown before a quick fire.\r\n\r\n_A la Provençale._--“Steep for two hours in some salt, pepper, and a\r\nlittle garlic; then toss in a small stew-pan over a brisk fire, with\r\nparsley chopped, and a little lemon-juice.”--_Dr. Badham._\r\n\r\n_Agaric Ketchup._--Place agarics of as large a size as you can procure,\r\nbut which are not worm-eaten, layer by layer, in a deep pan, sprinkling\r\neach layer as it is put in with a little salt. The next day stir them\r\nwell up several times, so as to mash and extract their juice. On the\r\nthird day strain off the liquor, measure, and boil for ten minutes, and\r\nthen to every pint of the liquor add half an ounce of black pepper, a\r\nquarter of an ounce of bruised ginger-root, a blade of mace, a clove or\r\ntwo, and a tea-spoonful of mustard-seed. Boil again for half an hour;\r\nput in two or three bay leaves, and set aside till quite cold. Pass\r\nthrough a strainer, and bottle; cork well, and dip the ends in resin. A\r\nvery little Chili vinegar is an improvement, and some add a glass of\r\nport wine, or a glass of strong ale to every bottle.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken that the spice is not added so abundantly as to\r\noverpower the true flavour of the agaric. A careful cook will keep back\r\na little of the simple boiled liquor to guard against this danger: a\r\ngood one will always avoid it. “Doctors weigh their things,” said a\r\ncapital cook, “but I go by taste.” But then, like poets, good cooks of\r\nthis order must be born so; they are not to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coprinus comatus_ (the Maned Agaric).\r\n\r\n_Pileus_ cylindrical, obtuse, campanulate, fleshy in the centre, but\r\nvery thin towards the margin. The external surface soon torn up into\r\nfleecy scales, with the exception of a cap at the top. _Gills_ free,\r\nlinear, and crowded. Quite white when young, becoming rose-coloured,\r\nsepia, and then black, from the margin upwards. They then expand\r\nquickly, curl up in shreds, and deliquesce into a black inky fluid which\r\nstains the ground. _Stem_ of a pure white, four to five inches high,\r\ncontracting at the top, and bulbous at the base; hollow, fibrillose,\r\nstuffed with a light cottony web. The bulb is solid and rooting, the\r\nring is movable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. _Coprinus comatus_ (Maned Mushroom). Pastures,\r\nparks, and roadsides, summer and autumn; colour, snow-white; height, 5\r\nto 12 inches.]\r\n\r\nThis very elegant agaric has also been called _Ag. cylindricus_, Schœff;\r\n_Ag. typhoides_, Bull; and _Ag. fimetarius_, Bolt. It is common\r\nthroughout the summer and autumn months, on road-sides, pastures, and\r\nwaste places. It is extremely variable in size. Its general appearance\r\nis so distinct and striking, that it cannot possibly be mistaken for any\r\nother agaric. It grows so abundantly on waste ground in the dwellings\r\nand farm-yards that it may be, says Dr. Bull, called the “agaric of\r\ncivilization;” and for both these reasons it is most valuable as an\r\nedible agaric. If its merits were known, it would be eaten as freely as\r\nthe common field mushroom.\r\n\r\n“The maned mushrooms,” Miss Plues has well said, “grow in dense\r\nclusters, each young plant like an attenuated egg, white and smooth.\r\nPresently some exceed the others in rapidity of growth, and their heads\r\nget above the ground, the stem elongates rapidly, the ring falls loosely\r\nround the stem, the margin of the pileus enlarges, and the oval head\r\nassumes a bell-shape; then a faint tint of brown spreads universally or\r\nin blotches over the upper part of the pileus, and the whiteness of its\r\ngills changes to a dull pink. A few more hours and the even head of the\r\npileus has split in a dozen places, the sections curl back, melt out of\r\nall form into an inky fluid, and on the morrow’s dawn a black stain on\r\nthe ground will be all that remains. And so on with the others in\r\nsuccession.”\r\n\r\n_Opinions on the Merits of Coprinus comatus as an Edible\r\nFungus._--“Esculent when young.”--_Berkeley._\r\n\r\n“Young specimens should be selected.”--_Badham._\r\n\r\n“No despicable dish, though perhaps not quite equal to the common\r\nmushroom.”--_M. C. Cooke._\r\n\r\n“If I had my choice, I think there is no species I should prefer before\r\nthis one: it is singularly rich, tender, and delicious.”--_Worthington\r\nG. Smith._\r\n\r\nDr. M‘Cullough, Dr. Chapman, Elmes Y. Steele, Esq., and some other\r\nmembers of the Woolhope Club, hold Mr. W. G. Smith’s opinion as the\r\nresult of considerable experience. It must be noted, however, that when\r\ntoo young this agaric is rather deficient in flavour, and its fibres\r\ntenacious. Its flavour is most rich, and its texture most delicate when\r\nthe gills show the pink colour with sepia margins.\r\n\r\n_Modes of Cooking the Coprinus comatus._--The best and simplest method\r\nis to broil it and serve on toast in the ordinary way. It may be added\r\nalso with great advantage to steaks and made-dishes, to give flavour and\r\ngravy.\r\n\r\n_Comatus Soup._--Take two quarts of white stock, and put in a large\r\nplateful of the maned agaric roughly broken out; stew until tender; pulp\r\nthrough a fine sieve; add pepper and salt to taste; boil and serve up\r\nhot. Two or three table-spoonfuls of cream will be a great improvement.\r\n\r\nThe agarics for this soup should be young, in order to keep its colour\r\nlight and good. The maned agaric is recommended on all sides for making\r\nketchup, but here, also, it should be quickly used, and the ketchup\r\nquickly made.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus gambosus_ (the True St. George’s Mushroom).\r\n\r\n_Pileus_ thick and fleshy, convex at first, often lobed, becoming\r\nundulated and irregular, expanding unequally; the margin more or less\r\ninvolute, and at first flocculose; from three to four inches across; of\r\na light yellow colour in the centre, fading to almost opaque white at\r\nthe edges; it is soft to the touch; more or less tuberculated, and often\r\npresenting cracks. _Gills_ yellowish-white, watery, narrow, marginate,\r\nannexed to the stem with a little tooth: they are very numerous and\r\nirregular, with many smaller ones interposed, “lying over each other\r\nlike the plaits of a frill” (from 5 to 11, Vittadini). _Stem_ firm,\r\nsolid and white, swelling at the base in young specimens; but in older\r\nones, though usually bulging, they are frequently of even size, and when\r\nin long grass they occasionally even taper downwards. This agaric is\r\nusually nearly white, smooth, soft, and firm, like kid leather to the\r\ntouch, and, as Berkeley has happily said, “in appearance it very closely\r\nresembles a cracknel biscuit.”\r\n\r\nThey grow in rings; have a strong smell, and appear about St. George’s\r\nDay (April 23), after the rains which usually fall about the third week\r\nin April. They continue to appear for three or four weeks, according to\r\nthe peculiarities of the season. They are usually to be found on hilly\r\npastures in woodland districts.\r\n\r\nThe St. George’s mushroom cannot well be mistaken for any other. The\r\nfact of its appearance at this early season, and growing so freely in\r\nrings, when so very few other funguses are to be found, is almost enough\r\nto distinguish it. It has, however, very distinctive characters in\r\nitself in the thickness of its pileus; the narrowness of its gills,\r\nwhich are very closely crowded together; and the solid bulging stem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 33. _Agaricus gambosus_ (St. George’s Mushroom).\r\nPastures, _in the spring_; colour, cream; diameter, 4 to 6 inches.]\r\n\r\nThe St. George’s mushroom is not an uncommon agaric in this country, and\r\nwhere it does appear it is usually plentiful--a single ring affording\r\ngenerally a good basket full. It should be gathered when young, or it\r\nwill be found grub-eaten, for no fungus is more speedily and more\r\nvoraciously attacked by insects than this one.\r\n\r\n_Opinions on the Merits of Agaricus gambosus as an Edible\r\nFungus._--“This rare and most delicious agaric, the _mouceron_ of\r\nBulliard, and the _Agaricus prunulus_ of other authors, abounds on the\r\nhills above the valley of Staffora, near Bobbio, where it is called\r\n_Spinaroli_, and is in great request; the country people eat it fresh in\r\na variety of ways, or they dry and sell it at from twelve to sixteen\r\nfrancs a pound.”--_Letter from Professor Balbi to Persoon._\r\n\r\n“The most savoury fungus with which I am acquainted ... and which is\r\njustly considered over almost the whole continent of Europe as the _ne\r\nplus ultra_ of culinary friandise.\r\n\r\n“The _prunulus_ (_gambosus_) is much prized in the Roman market, where\r\nit easily fetches, when fresh, thirty baiocchi--_i.e._, fifteen pence\r\nper pound--a large sum for any luxury in Rome. It is sent in little\r\nbaskets as presents to patrons, fees to medical men, and bribes to Roman\r\nlawyers.”--_Dr. Badham._\r\n\r\nThe _Agaricus gambosus_ “is one that a person cannot well make any\r\nmistake about. It sometimes attains a large size, is excellent in\r\nflavour, and particularly wholesome.”--_Rev. M. J. Berkeley._\r\n\r\n_Mode of Cooking Agaricus gambosus._--“The best mode of cooking\r\n_Agaricus gambosus_ is either to mince or fricassee it with any sort of\r\nmeat, or in a _vol-au-vent_, the flavour of which it greatly improves;\r\nor simply prepared with salt, pepper, and a small piece of bacon, lard,\r\nor butter, to prevent burning, it constitutes of itself an excellent\r\ndish.”--_Dr. Badham._ “Served with white sauce, it is a capital\r\nappendage to roast veal.”--_Edwin Lees._ It may be broiled, stewed, or\r\nbaked.\r\n\r\n_Breakfast Agaric._--Place some fresh-made toast, nicely divided, on a\r\ndish, and put the agarics upon it; pepper, salt, and put a small piece\r\nof butter on each; then pour on each one a tea-spoonful of milk or\r\ncream, and add a single clove to the whole dish. Place a bell-glass, or\r\ninverted basin, over the whole; bake twenty minutes, and serve up\r\nwithout removing the glass until it comes to the table, so as to\r\npreserve the heat and the aroma, which, on lifting the cover, will be\r\ndiffused through the room. It dries very readily when divided into\r\npieces, and retains most of its excellence. A few pieces added to soups,\r\ngravies, or made-dishes, give a delicious flavour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus rubescens_ (Brown Warty Agaric).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34. _Agaricus rubescens_ (Red-fleshed Mushroom).\r\nWoods, summer and autumn; colour, sienna-brown; diameter, 4 to 10\r\ninches.]\r\n\r\n_Pileus_ convex, then expanded, cuticle brown, scattered over with warts\r\nvarying in size. Margin striate. _Gills_ white, reaching the stem, and\r\nforming very fine decurrent lines upon it. _Ring_ entire, wide and\r\nmarked with striæ. _Stem_ often scaly, stuffed, becoming hollow; when\r\nold, bulbous. Volva obliterated. The whole plant has a tendency to turn\r\na sienna-red, or rust colour. This is very distinctly shown some little\r\ntime after it has been bruised.\r\n\r\nIt is very common all through the summer and autumn months; indeed, one\r\nof the most abundant mushrooms; “and it is one of those species that a\r\nperson with the slightest powers of discrimination may distinguish\r\naccurately from others.”--_Badham._\r\n\r\n_Opinions on the Merits of Agaricus rubescens as an Edible Fungus._--“A\r\nvery delicate fungus, which grows in sufficient abundance to render it\r\nof importance in a culinary point of view.”--_Badham._\r\n\r\n“From long experience I can vouch for its being not only wholesome, but,\r\nas Dr. Badham says, ‘a very delicate fungus.’”--_F. Currey_, Editor of\r\nDr. Badham’s “Esculent Funguses.”\r\n\r\n_Modes of Cooking the Agaricus rubescens._--It may be toasted, boiled,\r\nor stewed in the ordinary way.\r\n\r\n_Fried Rubescens._--Place the full-grown agarics in water for ten\r\nminutes, then drain, and having removed the warty skin, fry with butter,\r\npepper, and salt. The ketchup made from _Agaricus rubescens_ is rich and\r\ngood. “As it grows freely, and attains a considerable size, it is very\r\nsuitable for that purpose, quantity being a great desideratum in\r\nketchup-making.”--_Plues._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus nebularis_ (Clouded Mushroom).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. Agaricus nebularis (Clouded Mushroom). Woody\r\nplaces, in autumn; colour, cream, with slate-coloured top; diameter, 4\r\nto 10 inches.]\r\n\r\n“_Pileus_ from two and a half to five inches across; at first\r\ndepresso-convex; when expanded, nearly flat or broadly subumbonate;\r\nnever depressed; margin at first involute and pruinose; occasionally\r\nsomewhat waved and lobed, but generally regular in form; smooth, viscid\r\nwhen moist, so that dead leaves adhere to it; grey, brown at the centre,\r\npaler towards the circumference. _Flesh_ thick, white, unchanging.\r\n_Gills_ cream-colour, narrow, decurrent, close, their margins waved,\r\nunequal, generally simple. _Stem_ from two to four inches long, from a\r\nquarter of an inch to an inch thick; incurved at the base; not rooting,\r\nbut attaching by means of a floccose down round its lower portion and\r\nfor one-third of its length, a large quantity of dead leaves, by which\r\nthe plant is held erect; subequal, more or less marked with longitudinal\r\npits, firm externally, within of a softer substance. The _odour_ strong,\r\nlike that of curd cheese.”--_Badham._\r\n\r\n“Common in certain places, but very rare near London. This species comes\r\nup late in the autumn on dead leaves in moist places, principally on the\r\nborders of woods. The gastronomic excellences of this species are well\r\nknown. When gathered, it has a wholesome and powerful odour; and when\r\ncooked, the firm and fragrant flesh has a particularly agreeable and\r\npalatable taste.”--_W. G. Smith._\r\n\r\n“The _Agaricus nebularis_ requires but little cooking; a few minutes’\r\nbroiling (_à la_ Maintenon is best), with butter, pepper, and salt, is\r\nsufficient. It may also be delicately fried with bread crumbs, or stewed\r\nin white sauce. The flesh of this mushroom is perhaps lighter of\r\ndigestion than that of any other.”--_Badham._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius deliciosus_ (Orange-milk Mushroom).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. _Lactarius deliciosus_ (Orange-milk Mushroom).\r\nUnder fir-trees, in autumn; colour, brown-orange; milk at first orange,\r\nthen green; diameter, 3 to 10 inches.]\r\n\r\n_Pileus_ smooth, fleshy, umbilicate, of a dull rufous orange, turning\r\npallid from exposure to light and air, but zoned with concentric circles\r\nof a brighter hue; margin smooth, at first involute, and then becoming\r\nexpanded; from three to five inches across. Flesh firm full of\r\norange-red milk, which turns green on exposure to the air, as does any\r\npart of the plant when bruised. _Gills_ decurrent, narrow, each\r\ndividing into two, three several times from the stem to the edge of the\r\npileus; of a dull yellow by reflected light, but being translucent, the\r\nred milk shines brightly through them. _Stem_ from one to three inches\r\nhigh, slightly bent and tapering downwards; solid, becoming more or less\r\nhollow with age; short hairs at the base; sometimes pitted\r\n(scrobiculate).\r\n\r\nThere is no possibility of mistaking this fungus. It is the only one\r\nwhich has _orange-red milk_, and which _turns green when bruised_. These\r\nproperties distinguish it at once from _Lactarius torminosus_ or\r\n_necator_, the only fungus which in any way resembles it.\r\n\r\nThis acrid fungus (_Lactarius torminosus_) is somewhat similar in shape\r\nand size, and is also zoned. But the involute edges of the pileus are\r\nbearded with close hairs. It is of a much paler colour, and with gills\r\nof a dirty white. The milk, also, is white, acrid, and unchangeable in\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nThe Orange-milk agaric chiefly affects the Scotch fir-tree, and is\r\ngenerally to be found beneath the drip of the branches around the tree.\r\nIt is also found in hedgerows occasionally, but is most abundant in\r\nplantations of Scotch fir or larch.\r\n\r\n_Opinions on the Merits of Lactarius deliciosus as an Edible\r\nFungus._--“This is one of the best agarics with which I am acquainted,\r\nfully deserving both its name and the estimation in which it is held\r\nabroad, it reminds me of tender lambs’ kidneys.”--_Dr. Badham._\r\n\r\n“Very luscious eating, full of rich gravy, with a little of the flavour\r\nof mussels.”--_Sowerby._\r\n\r\n“Cook them well, and you will have something better than kidneys, which\r\nthey much resemble both in flavour and consistence.”--_Mrs. Hussey._\r\n\r\n_Modes of Cooking Lactarius deliciosus._--“The rich gravy it produces is\r\nits chief characteristic, and hence it commends itself to make a rich\r\ngravy sauce, or as an ingredient in soups. It requires delicate cooking,\r\nfor though fleshy it becomes tough if kept on the fire till all the\r\njuice is exuded. Baking is perhaps the best process for this agaric to\r\npass through. It should be dressed when fresh and pulpy.”--_Edwin Lees._\r\n\r\n_Stewed Deliciosus._--“The _tourtière_ (or pie-dish) method of cooking\r\nsuits _Lactarius deliciosus_ best, as it is firm and crisp in substance.\r\nBe careful to use only sound specimens. Reduce them by cutting across to\r\none uniform bulk. Place the pieces in a pie-dish, with a little pepper\r\nand salt, and a small piece of butter on each side of every slice. Tie a\r\npaper over the dish, and bake gently for three-quarters of an hour.\r\nServe them up in the same hot dish.”--_Mrs. Hussey._\r\n\r\n_Deliciosus Pie._--Pepper and salt slices of the agaric, and place them\r\nin layers with thin slices of fresh bacon, until a small pie-dish is\r\nfull; cover with a crust of pastry or mashed potatoes, and bake gently\r\nfor three-quarters of an hour. If with potato crust, brown nicely before\r\na quick fire.\r\n\r\n_Deliciosus Pudding._--Cut the agaric into small pieces; add similar\r\npieces of bacon, pepper, and salt, and a little garlic or spice;\r\nsurround with crust, and boil three-quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\n_Fried Deliciosus._--Fry in slices, properly seasoned with butter, or\r\nbacon and gravy; and serve up hot with sippets of toast. A steak in\r\naddition is a great improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morchella esculenta_ (the Morel).\r\n\r\nEvery one knows the Morel--that expensive luxury which the rich are\r\ncontent to procure at great cost from our Italian warehouses, and the\r\npoor are fain to do without. It is less generally known that this\r\nfungus, though by no means so common with us as some others (a\r\ncircumstance partly attributable to the prevailing ignorance as to when\r\nand where to look for it, or even of its being indigenous to England),\r\noccurs not unfrequently in our orchards and woods, towards the beginning\r\nof summer. Roques reports favourably of some specimens sent to him by\r\nthe Duke of Athol; and others, from different parts of the country,\r\noccasionally find their way into Covent Garden Market. The genus\r\n_Morchella_ comprises very few species, and they are all good to eat.\r\nPersoon remarks, that though the Morel rarely appears in a sandy soil,\r\npreferring a calcareous or argillaceous ground, it frequently springs up\r\non sites where charcoal has been burnt, or where cinders have been\r\nthrown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. _Morchella esculenta_ (the Morel). Woods, &c.,\r\nin the spring; colour pale buff; height, 3 to 5 inches.]\r\n\r\n_Pileus_ very various in shape and hue, the surface broken-up into very\r\nlittle cells, made by folds or plaits of the hymenium, which are more or\r\nless salient, and constitute the so-called ribs. These _ribs_ are very\r\nirregular, and anastomose with each other throughout; the pileus\r\nhollow, opening into the irregular stem. _Spores_ pale yellow. Neither\r\nof these funguses should be gathered after rain, as they are then\r\ninsipid and soon spoil.\r\n\r\n“M. Roques says the Morel may be dressed in a variety of ways, both\r\nfresh and dry, with butter or in oil, _au gras_ or _à la crême_. The\r\nfollowing receipts for cooking them are from Persoon. 1st. Having washed\r\nand cleansed them from the earth which is apt to collect between the\r\nplaits, dry thoroughly in a napkin, and put them into a saucepan with\r\npepper, salt, and parsley, adding or not a piece of ham; stew for an\r\nhour, pouring in occasionally a little broth to prevent burning; when\r\nsufficiently done, bind with the yolk of two or three eggs, and serve on\r\nbuttered toast. 2nd. _Morelles à l’Italienne._--Having washed and dried,\r\ndivide them across, put them on the fire with some parsley, scallion,\r\nchervil, burnet, tarragon, chives, a little salt, and two spoonfuls of\r\nfine oil. Stew till the juice runs out, then thicken with a little\r\nflour; serve with bread-crumbs and a squeeze of lemon. 3rd. _Stuffed\r\nMorels._--Choose the freshest and whitest morels, open the stalk at the\r\nbottom, wash and wipe them well, fill with veal stuffing, anchovy, or\r\nany rich _farce_ you please, securing the ends, and dressing between\r\nthin slices of bacon; serve with a sauce like the last.”--_Badham._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus pratensis._\r\n\r\n“_Pileus_ convexo-plane, then turbinate, smooth, moist; disc compact,\r\ngibbous; margin thin; _stem_ stuffed, even, attenuated downwards;\r\n_gills_ deeply decurrent, arcuate, thick, distant.”--_Grev. t. 91; Huss.\r\nII. t. 40._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38 (1). _Hygrophorus pratensis._ Pastures, in\r\nautumn; colour, full buff; diameter, 2 to 3 inches.\r\n\r\nFig. 38 (2). _Hygrophorus virgineus_ (Viscid White Mushroom). Pastures,\r\nin autumn; snow-white; diameter, ½ inch to 1½ inches.]\r\n\r\n“On downs and short pastures. Very common. _Pileus_ tawny or\r\ndeep buff, sometimes nearly white, as in the next. Probably\r\nesculent.”--_Berkeley._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus virgineus_ (Viscid White Mushroom).\r\n\r\n“_Pileus_ fleshy, convexo-plane, obtuse, moist, at length\r\nareolato-rimose; _stem_ stuffed, firm, short, attenuated at the base;\r\n_gills_ decurrent, distant, rather thick.”--_Grev. t. 166._ “On\r\ndowns and short pastures. Extremely common. Mostly pure\r\nivory-white.”--_Berkeley._\r\n\r\nThis species, exquisite in form and flavour, is one of the prettiest\r\nornaments of our lawns, downs, and short pastures at the fall of the\r\nyear. In these situations it may be found in every part of the kingdom.\r\nIt is essentially _waxy_, and feels and looks precisely as if made of\r\nthe purest virgin wax. The stem is firm, stuffed, and attenuated, and\r\nthe gills singularly distant from each other; it changes colour a little\r\nwhen getting old, at which time it is unfit for culinary purposes.\r\n\r\nA batch of fresh specimens, broiled or stewed with taste and care, will\r\nprove agreeable, succulent, and flavorous eating, and may sometimes be\r\nobtained when other species are not forthcoming.\r\n\r\n“Several allied species enjoy the reputation of being esculent, notably\r\n_H. niveus_; and my friend Mr. F. C. Penrose has eaten, and speaks\r\nfavourably of _H. psittacinus_--a highly ornamental yellow species, with\r\na green stem, sometimes common enough in rich pastures (and _said_ to be\r\nvery suspicious).”--_W. G. Smith._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cantharellus cibarius_ (Chantarelle).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. _Cantharellus cibarius_ (Chantarelle). Woods,\r\nautumn; rich golden yellow; diameter, 2 to 4 inches.]\r\n\r\nWhen young its _stalk_ is tough, white, and solid; but as it grows this\r\nbecomes hollow and presently changes to yellow; tapering below, it is\r\neffused into the substance of the _pileus_, which is of the same colour\r\nwith it. The _pileus_ is lobed, and irregular in shape; its margin at\r\nfirst deeply involute, afterwards when expanded, wavy. The _veins_ or\r\nplaits are thick, subdistant, much sinuated, running some way down the\r\nstalk. The _flesh_ is white, fibrous, dense, “having the odour of\r\napricots” (_Purton_) or of “plums” (_Vitt._). “The _colour_ yellow, like\r\nthat of the yolk of eggs, is deeper on the under surface; when raw it\r\nhas the pungent taste of pepper: the _spores_, which are elliptic, are\r\nof a pallid ochre colour.” (_Vitt._) The Chantarelle grows sometimes\r\nsporadically, sometimes in circles or segments of a circle, and may be\r\nfound from June to October. At first it assumes the shape of a minute\r\ncone: next, in consequence of the rolling in of the margin, the pileus\r\nis almost spherical, but as this unfolds it becomes hemispherical, then\r\nflat, at length irregular and depressed.\r\n\r\n“This fungus,” observes Vittadini, “being rather dry and tough by\r\nnature, requires a considerable quantity of fluid sauce to cook it\r\nproperly.” “The common people in Italy dry or pickle, or keep it in oil\r\nfor winter use. Perhaps the best ways of dressing the Chantarelle are to\r\nstew or mince it by itself, or to combine it with meat or with other\r\nfunguses. It requires to be gently stewed, and a long time to make it\r\ntender; but by soaking it in milk the night before, less cooking will be\r\nrequisite.”--_Badham._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum repandum_ (Hedgehog, or Spine-bearing Mushroom).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. _Hydnum repandum_ (Spine-bearing Mushroom).\r\nWoods, autumn; colour, pale buff; diameter, 2 to 5 inches.]\r\n\r\n_Pileus_ smooth, irregular in shape, depressed in the centre, more or\r\nless lobed, and generally placed irregularly on the stem (eccentric); of\r\na pale buff or cinnamon colour; from two to five inches in diameter.\r\nFlesh firm and white; when bruised it turns slightly brown. _Spines_\r\ncrowded, awl-shaped, slanting, soft and brittle, varying in size and\r\nlength, and of a faint cinnamon tint. _Stem_ white, short, solid,\r\ncrooked, and often lateral.\r\n\r\nThere is no possibility of mistaking the hedgehog mushroom: when once\r\nseen it is always to be remembered. Its awl-shaped spines are crowded\r\nbeneath the pileus; its size and colour are most marked; it resembles\r\nclosely, as has been said, a lightly-baked cracknel biscuit in colour.\r\n\r\n“This fungus occurs principally in woods, and especially in those of\r\npine and oak; sometimes solitary, but more frequently in company and in\r\nrings.”--_Badham._\r\n\r\n_Opinions on the Merits of Hydnum repandum as an Edible Fungus._--“The\r\ngeneral use of this fungus throughout France, Italy, and Germany, leaves\r\nno room for doubt as to its good qualities.”--_Roques._\r\n\r\n“When well stewed it is an excellent dish, with a slight flavour of\r\noysters. It makes also a very good _purée_.--_Dr. Badham._\r\n\r\n“A most excellent fungus, but it requires a little caution in\r\npreparation for the table. It should be previously steeped in hot water\r\nand well drained in a cloth; in which case there is certainly not a more\r\nexcellent fungus.”--_Berkeley._\r\n\r\n“A wholesome fungus and not to be despised; but not in the first class\r\nas to flavour, requiring the help of condiments. It has the advantage,\r\nhowever, of growing later than most funguses, and may be found up to the\r\nmiddle of November.”--_Edwin Lees._\r\n\r\n“One of the most excellent fungi that grows; its flavour very strongly\r\nresembles oysters.”--_The Rev. W. Houghton._\r\n\r\n_Modes of Cooking Hydnum repandum._--The hedgehog mushroom is dense in\r\nstructure, and in whatever way it may be cooked, all authorities agree\r\nthat it must be done slowly at a low temperature until it is tender, and\r\nwith plenty of stock or white sauce to supply its deficiency in\r\nmoisture.\r\n\r\n_Stewed Hydnum._--“Cut the mushrooms in pieces and steep for twenty\r\nminutes in warm water; then place in a pan with butter, pepper, salt,\r\nand parsley; add beef or other gravy, and simmer for an hour.”--_Trans.\r\nfrom M. Roques._\r\n\r\n“Stew in a brown or white sauce.”--_Mrs. Hussey._\r\n\r\n“Cut up in bits about the size of a bean, and stew in white sauce, when\r\nit will almost pass off as oyster sauce.”--_The Rev. W. Houghton,\r\nF.L.S._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus orcella_ (Orgelle or Vegetable Sweetbread).\r\n\r\n_Pileus_ thin, irregular, depressed in the centre, lobed, with undulated\r\nborders, from two to three inches across. In colour clear white,\r\nsometimes tinted with pale brown on its prominences, and occasionally\r\nwith a grey centre or even lightly zoned with grey. Its surface is soft\r\nand smooth to the touch, except in wet weather, when it becomes soft\r\nand sticky. The flesh is soft, colourless, and unchangeable. _Gills_\r\ncrowded, decurrent, at first nearly white, then pinkish grey, taking at\r\nlength a light brown tint. Spores pale brown. _Stem_ smooth, solid,\r\nshort, decreasing in size; central when young, but becoming eccentric\r\nfrom the pileus growing irregularly. _Odour_ pleasant, usually compared\r\nto that of fresh meal, but Dr. Badham and others think it resembles more\r\nclosely the smell of cucumber or syringa leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. (1) _Agaricus orcella_ and (2) _Agaricus\r\nprunulus_ (Plum Mushroom). Woody places, in autumn; colour, snow-white,\r\nwith pale rose gills; diameter, 2 to 4 inches.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus prunulus_ (Plum Mushroom).\r\n\r\n_Pileus_ fleshy, compact, at first convex, then expanded, becoming\r\ndepressed in the centre, irregularly waved, and slightly pruinose; from\r\ntwo to five inches broad; surface dry, soft, white, or sometimes grey.\r\nThe flesh thick, white, and unchangeable. _Gills_ crowded, deeply\r\ndecurrent, at first white, then a pale dull flesh-colour, or yellowish\r\nbrown. Spores pale brown. _Stem_ white, solid, firm, slightly\r\nventricose, an inch or more long, and half an inch thick; naked, often\r\nstriate, and villose at the base; often eccentric. _Odour_ like that of\r\nnew meal, but usually too strong to be agreeable.\r\n\r\nThere has been considerable confusion, writes Dr. Bull, between the two\r\nAgarics _orcella_ and _prunulus_; some thinking that we have only\r\n_orcella_ in England (_Dr. Badham_); and others only _prunulus_ (the\r\n_Rev. M. J. Berkeley_), and others again that they are both the same\r\nfungus, differing only in size. Dr. Badham and some others again confuse\r\n_prunulus_ with _gambosus_, the fungus of early spring, and this has\r\narisen from the French term _mousseron_ being often applied to both\r\nthese funguses; but they are so essentially different as not to be\r\nliable in any way to be mistaken for each other. _Agaricus orcella_ and\r\n_A. prunulus_ are both placed on the same page in the illustration, so\r\nthat their close alliance may be seen at a glance. Fries treats them as\r\nseparate funguses, “in deference to ancient authority, since their\r\ndifferences are chiefly in degree.” These differences are, nevertheless,\r\nso well marked, that they are kept separate here. _Orcella_ is a smaller\r\nand more delicate fungus than _prunulus_. It is thinner and less fleshy,\r\nmore undulated in its borders, and has a lighter and more agreeable\r\nodour. _Orcella_ grows in more open glades than _prunulus_; it is\r\nusually much whiter in colour, sometimes in high situations white and\r\nglazed as an egg-shell, or even pottery. _Orcella_ grows more solitary\r\nthan _prunulus_, in light, scattered groups, showing an inclination for\r\nthe neighbourhood of oak-trees, and where it does grow it may be found\r\nyear after year in the same place, but seldom more than two or three in\r\na spot. Last year, 1869, when _orcella_ was pretty plentiful, _prunulus_\r\nwas not to be found in the situations where it grows usually most\r\nabundantly. _Prunulus_ is the reverse of all this. It prefers more\r\nshaded places, is larger, more fleshy, and with a strong odour rather\r\nheavy and overpowering. It grows in greater quantities together, and not\r\nunfrequently in crowded rings from four to six feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nAs edible funguses they should certainly be kept distinct. _Orcella_ is\r\nlight and pleasant in odour, and excellent in flavour: it is so tender\r\nand delicate as to be termed, not inaptly, “vegetable sweetbread.”\r\n_Prunulus_, on the other hand, though always good, is to many people\r\ntoo strong in odour, and more coarse in taste.\r\n\r\n_Opinions on the Merits of Agaricus orcella and A. prunulus._--“A very\r\ndelicate mushroom.”--_Dr. Badham._ “The flavour of _orcella_ is very\r\ndelicate, and equal to anything amongst fungi, or rather superior to the\r\nmajority. The same remarks apply to _prunulus_, which I think is the\r\nsame thing. It belongs to the first rank of edible fungi.”--_Edwin\r\nLees._\r\n\r\n_Modes of Cooking Agaricus orcella and Agaricus prunulus._--_Orcella_\r\nbeing usually found in small quantities, is best, perhaps, when broiled\r\nand served on hot toast. _Prunulus_ will yield an abundance for broiling\r\nor stewing, or both. “_Orcella_ should be eaten the day it is gathered,\r\neither stewed, broiled, or fried with egg and bread-crumbs like\r\ncutlets.”--_Dr. Badham._ “However prepared, it is most excellent; the\r\nflesh is firm and juicy, and full of flavour, and whether broiled or\r\nstewed, it is a most delicious morsel.”--_Worthington G. Smith._\r\n“_Orcella_ will dry, and may be preserved in this way. It loses much of\r\nits volume, but it acquires _un aroma suavissimo_.”--_Vittadini._ _From\r\nthe Transactions of the Woolhope Naturalists’ Field Club._\r\n\r\n_Edible Fungi in America._--To give an idea of the rich stores of fungi\r\nthat spring up in some distant parts of the earth, and in climes so\r\ndifferent to ours that one would at first sight suppose such fragile and\r\nfugacious bodies as fungi would not abound in them, the following\r\ninteresting communication from Dr. Curtis, of South Carolina, to the\r\nRev. W. Berkeley is here given. It will prove well worthy the attention\r\nof American readers:--\r\n\r\n“You have asked me to give you my ‘experience with the eatable mushrooms\r\nof America.’ This will be most satisfactorily done, I presume, in pretty\r\nmuch the same style in which I would narrate it to you at your own\r\nfireside. My experience runs back only about twelve or fifteen years.\r\nYou may remember that previous to this period I expressed a fear of\r\nthese edibles, as I had grown up with the common prejudices against them\r\nentertained by most people in this country. Having occasionally read of\r\nfearful accidents from their use, and there being abundance of other and\r\nwholesome food obtainable, I felt no inclination to run any risks in\r\nneedlessly enlarging my bill of fare. Thus I had passed middle life\r\nwithout having once even tasted a mushroom.\r\n\r\n“But as under your guidance and assistance my knowledge of fungi\r\nincreased, a confidence in my ability to discriminate species grew up\r\nwith it, and a curiosity to test the qualities of these much-lauded\r\narticles got the better of timidity; and now, I suppose, I can safely\r\nsay, that I have eaten a greater variety of mushrooms than anyone on the\r\nAmerican continent. I have even introduced several species before\r\nuntried and unknown. From the beginning of my experiments, however, I\r\nhave exercised great caution, even with species long recognised as safe\r\nand wholesome. In every case I began with only a single mouthful. No ill\r\neffect following, I made a second essay upon two or three mouthfuls, and\r\nso on gradually until I made a full meal of them. Fortunately, I have\r\nnever blundered upon any kind that was mischievous, although I have\r\neaten freely of forty species. This is due, perhaps, to my general\r\nacquaintance with species that have been long used in Europe, and hence\r\nI have made no experiments upon new species which had not some affinity\r\nor analogy with them.\r\n\r\n“For instance, _A. campestris_ and _A. arvensis_ being wholesome, I did\r\nnot doubt but that _A. amygdalinus_ (a new species closely allied to _A.\r\narvensis_) might be safely attempted, and it has proved equally safe and\r\npalatable. Indeed, this may be regarded as the safest of all species for\r\ngathering, as it can be discriminated from all others even by a child or\r\na blind person. Its taste and odour are so very like those of peach\r\nkernels or bitter almonds, that almost invariably the resemblance is\r\nimmediately mentioned by those who taste it crude for the first time.\r\nThis flavour is lost by cooking, unless the mushroom be underdone. When\r\nthoroughly cooked I cannot myself distinguish it from _A. campestris_.\r\nOne or two persons have expressed the opinion that they can distinguish\r\nit, and that it is not quite so good. Others, again, are equally\r\npositive that it is better. In the crude state I deem it the most\r\npalatable of all mushrooms, as it leaves a very agreeable aftertaste\r\nupon the palate, fully equal to that of almonds. This is the thing I\r\nsent you some years since for cultivation, but which failed to grow. I\r\nvery much wish it might be propagated in England, so that we might\r\nascertain whether it would undergo any change of qualities in a\r\ndifferent soil and climate. I have for some time been entertaining the\r\nsuspicion that such is the case with many of our species. Thus, in\r\nEuropean books the Morel is described as possessing a peculiar flavour,\r\nthat has given its name to the Morello cherry. I can detect nothing of\r\nthe sort in our morel. You speak of _A. Cæsareus_ (in _Introd. Crypt.\r\nBot._) as being ‘perhaps the most delicious of all fungi.’ This grows in\r\ngreat quantities in our oak-forests, and may be obtained by the cartload\r\nin its season; but to my taste, and that of all my family, it is the\r\nmost unpalatable of all our fungi, nor can I find many of our most\r\npassionate mycophagists who will avow that they like it. I have tried it\r\nin almost every mode of cookery, but without success. There is a\r\ndisagreeable saline flavour that we cannot remove nor overlay.\r\n\r\n“In the _Tricholoma_ section, in which are several species long known as\r\nedible, I did not hesitate to experiment upon any that had the odour and\r\ntaste of fresh flour. I began with _A. frumentaceus_, not learning from\r\nbooks whether it had been eaten in Europe. To this I subsequently added\r\nthree new American species belonging to the same group. All are\r\nexcellent when stewed, and are especially valuable for their appearance\r\nin late autumn, even during hard frosts, when other agarics are mostly\r\nout of season.\r\n\r\n“Again, there seemed such a similarity of texture and habit between _A.\r\ncæspitosus_ (_Lentinus_, Berk.) and _A. melleus_, although the former\r\nbelongs to _Clitocybe_, that the temptation to a trial of it was\r\nirresistible. As it is found here in enormous quantities, and a single\r\ncluster will often contain fifty to a hundred stems, it might well be\r\ndeemed a valuable species in a time of scarcity. It would not be highly\r\nesteemed where other and better sorts can be had; but it is generally\r\npreferred to _A. melleus_. I have found this species very suitable for\r\ndrying for winter use.\r\n\r\n“Among the _Boleti_ I ventured, in ignorance if it had ever been eaten,\r\nto try _B. collinitus_, on account of its close relationship with _B.\r\nflavidus_. I am not particularly fond of _Boleti_, but this species has\r\nbeen pronounced delicious by some to whom I have sent it.\r\n\r\n“So among the _Polypores_, I had no fear of harm from the use of a new\r\nAmerican species (_P. poripes_, Fr.), on account of its relation to _P.\r\novinus_, in its texture and its flavour. The taste of the crude specimen\r\nis like that of the best chestnuts or filberts. It has been compared\r\neven with the cocoa-nut, and is certainly of very agreeable flavour. It\r\ndoes not, however, make a superior dish for the table, being rather too\r\ndry, but it is innocent and probably nutritious.\r\n\r\n“Of the ‘_Merisma_’ group of _Polypores_, having already tried _P.\r\nfrondosus_, _P. confluens_, and _P. sulfureus_, I ventured, after some\r\nhesitation, and with more than usual caution, to test the virtues of a\r\nnew American species (_P. Berkelei_, Fr.), notwithstanding the intense\r\npungency of the raw material, which bites as fiercely as _Lactarius\r\npiperatus_. When young, and before the pores are visible, the substance\r\nis quite crisp and brittle, and in this state I have eaten it with\r\nimpunity and with satisfaction, its pungency being all dissipated by\r\nstewing. I do not, however, deem it comparable with _P. confluens_,\r\nwhich is rather a favourite with me, as it is with some others to whom I\r\nhave introduced it. _P. sulfureus_ is just tolerable; safe, but not to\r\nbe coveted when one can get better. When I say safe, I mean not\r\npoisonous. I cannot recommend it as a diet for weak stomachs, which\r\nshould be said of some other fungi of similar texture. I am here\r\nreminded of an experience I had three or four years ago with this\r\nspecies, which would have greatly alarmed me had it happened at an\r\nearlier date in my experiments, and which would probably have deterred\r\nanyone unused to this kind of diet from ever indulging in it again. I\r\nhad a sumptuous dish of it on my supper-table, of which most of my\r\nfamily, as well as a guest staying with us, partook very freely. During\r\nthe night I became exceedingly sick, and was not relieved until relieved\r\nof my supper. My first thought on the accession of my illness was of\r\n_Polyporus sulfureus_; but as I remembered that inflammation was one of\r\nthe symptoms of fungus-poisoning, and I could detect no indications of\r\nthis in my case, I soon dismissed the rising fear, did not send for the\r\ndoctor, nor take any remedy. Others, who had partaken of the fungus more\r\nfreely than myself were not at all affected; and I presume my sickness\r\nwas no more induced by the _Polyporus_ than by the bread and butter I\r\nhad eaten. And yet, had I alone partaken of the dish, or had one or two\r\nothers been affected in like manner, doubtless the night attack would\r\nhave been very confidently attributed by some to the mushroom; or had\r\nthis been my first trial of that article, possibly I might ever after\r\nhave regarded it with suspicion. I learned a few days afterwards from\r\none of our physicians, that this kind of sickness was then somewhat\r\nprevalent in the community, and could be attributed to no known cause.\r\nFor the credit of this species, therefore, we were fortunately able to\r\ndistinguish the _post hoc_ from the _propter hoc_.\r\n\r\n“There are families in America that for generations have freely and\r\nannually eaten mushrooms, preserving a habit brought from Europe by\r\ntheir ancestors. In no case have I heard of an accident among them. I\r\nhave known no instance of mushroom-poisoning in this country, except\r\nwhere the victims rashly ventured upon the experiment without knowing\r\none species from another. Among the families above mentioned, I have not\r\nmet with any whose knowledge of mushrooms extended beyond the common\r\nspecies (_A. campestris_), called pink gill in this country. Several\r\nsuch families live near me, but not one of them was aware, until I\r\ninformed them, that there are other edible kinds. Everything but the\r\npink gill, which had the form of a mushroom, was to them a toadstool,\r\nand poisonous. When I first sent my son with a fine basket of Imperials\r\n(_A. Cæsareus_), to an intelligent physician, who was extravagantly fond\r\nof the common mushroom, the lad was greeted with the indignant\r\nexclamation, ‘Boy, I wouldn’t eat one of those things to save your\r\nfather’s head!’ When told that they were eaten at my table, he accepted\r\nthem, ate them, and has eaten many a one since, with all safety and with\r\nno little relish. Since that time our mycophagists eat whatever I send\r\nthem, without fear or suspicion.\r\n\r\n“I have interested myself to extend the knowledge of these things among\r\nthe lovers of mushrooms, and also their use among those who have not\r\nbefore tried them. In the latter work I am not always successful, on\r\naccount of a strong prejudice against vegetables with such contemptible\r\nnames, and an unconquerable fear of accidents. Yet, as in my own case,\r\ncuriosity often conquers these errors. When away from home I have\r\nfrequently obtained permission from a kind hostess to have cooked a dish\r\nof mushrooms that I have found on her premises. It has rarely occurred\r\nin such cases that the dish, then tasted for the first time, was not\r\ndeclared to be delicious, or the best thing ever put in the mouth. This\r\nlatter phrase was once used in reference to so indifferent an article as\r\n_A. salignus_. Indeed, I have found several persons who class this\r\namongst the most palatable species. To such persons a dish of fresh\r\nmushrooms need seldom be wanting, as this one can be had every month of\r\nthe year in this latitude. I am induced to believe that the quality of\r\nthis species varies with the kind of wood it grows from, and that it is\r\nbetter flavoured when gathered from the mulberry, and especially from\r\nthe hickory, than when taken from most other trees. Its fitness for the\r\ntable seems also to depend much upon the rapidity of its growth; those\r\nwhich grow slowly, as is the case with some of our garden vegetables,\r\nbeing of tougher texture and of less delicate flavour. A warm sun after\r\nheavy rains brings them out in greatest perfection.\r\n\r\n“I have several times been asked by persons eating mushrooms for the\r\nfirst time, whether these things belong to the vegetable or animal\r\nkingdom. There is certainly a very noticeable resemblance in the flavour\r\nof some of them to that of flesh, fish, or mollusc, so that the\r\nquestion, as founded merely on taste, is not an unnatural one. But I was\r\nmuch struck with its propriety when reading an article in ‘Fraser’s\r\nMagazine,’ a few years since, written by the late Mr. Broderip, who\r\ntherein says that mushrooms contain osmazome. If this be so, it\r\naccounts both for their flavour and for their value as food. Of this\r\nlatter quality I had become so well convinced that, during our late war,\r\nI sometimes averred, and I doubt if there was much, if any, exaggeration\r\nin the assertion, that in some parts of the country I could maintain a\r\nregiment of soldiers five months of the year upon mushrooms alone.\r\n\r\n“This leads to a remark which should not be overlooked, upon the great\r\nabundance of eatable mushrooms in the United States. I think it is Dr.\r\nBadham who boasts of their unusual number in Great Britain, stating that\r\nthere are thirty edible species in that kingdom. I cannot help thinking\r\nthat this is an under-estimate. But if the Doctor is correct, there is\r\nno comparison between the number in your country and this. I have\r\ncollected and eaten forty species found within two miles of my house.\r\nThere are some others within this limit which I have not yet eaten. In\r\nthe catalogue of the plants of North Carolina, you will notice that I\r\nhave indicated one hundred and eleven species of edible fungi known to\r\ninhabit this State. I have no doubt there are forty or fifty more, as\r\nthe alpine portion of the State, which is very extensive and varied, has\r\nbeen very little explored in search of fungi.\r\n\r\n“In October, 1866, while on the Cumberland Mountains in Tennessee, a\r\nplateau less than 1000 feet above the valleys below, although having\r\nvery little leisure for examination during the two days spent there, I\r\ncounted eighteen species of edible fungi. Of the four or five species\r\nwhich I collected there for the table, all who partook of them, none of\r\nwhom had before eaten mushrooms, most emphatically declared them\r\ndelicious. On my return homeward, while stopping for a few hours at a\r\nstation in Virginia, I gathered eight good species within a few hundred\r\nyards of the dépôt. And so it seems to be throughout the country. Hill\r\nand plain, mountain and valley, woods, fields, and pastures, swarm with\r\na profusion of good, nutritious fungi, which are allowed to decay where\r\nthey spring up, because people do not know how, or are afraid, to use\r\nthem. By those of us who know their use their value was appreciated, as\r\nnever before, during our late war, when other food, especially meat, was\r\nscarce and dear. Then such persons as I have heard express a preference\r\nfor mushrooms over meat had generally no need to lack grateful food, as\r\nit was easily had for the gathering, and within easy distance of their\r\nhomes if living in the country. Such was not always the case, however. I\r\nremember on one occasion during the gloomy period, when there had been a\r\nprotracted drought, and fleshy fungi were to be found only in damp,\r\nshaded woods, and but few even there, I was unable to find enough of any\r\none species for a meal; so gathering of every kind, I brought home\r\nthirteen different kinds, had them all cooked together in one grand\r\n_pot pourri_, and made an excellent supper. Among these was the\r\nChantarelle, upon which I would say a few words in confirmation of what\r\nI have already said upon the varying qualities of mushrooms in different\r\nregions and localities. You have somewhere written of this mushroom as\r\nbeing so highly esteemed a delicacy, that it is much sought for when a\r\ndinner of state is given in London. Can this be because it is a rarity?\r\n(for nothing common and easily obtained is deemed a delicacy, I\r\nbelieve), or because you have it of finer flavour in England? Here,\r\nwhere it abounds, no one seems to care at all for it, and some would\r\nforego mushrooms entirely rather than eat this. It certainly varies much\r\nin quality, as I have occasionally found it quite palatable, and again,\r\nthough cooked in the same mode, very indifferent. I have been unable to\r\nascertain whether this difference is due to locality, exposure, shade,\r\nsoil, moisture, or temperature. That soil has much to do with the\r\nflavour of some species of mushrooms I am well convinced. In a parcel of\r\npink gills I have sometimes found one or two specimens, though perfectly\r\nsound, of such unpleasant odour and taste as would spoil a whole dish.\r\nSo also with the snowball (_A. arvensis_), of which I annually find a\r\nfew beautiful specimens growing near my residence, upon a grassy turf\r\nwhich covers a pile of trash made up of decomposed sticks, leaves, and\r\nscrapings from the adjoining soil. Their taste and odour are perfectly\r\ndetestable. I had one specimen cooked, but no amount of seasoning could\r\nabate the offensiveness of the odious thing; yet within a hundred yards\r\nof these I gather specimens of the same identical species, which are of\r\nfine flavour, equal to that of the best mushrooms. As I have before\r\nintimated the varying flavour of mushrooms growing on different kinds of\r\nwood, so here I suppose the unpleasant qualities of some specimens of\r\nthese two well-known and favourite species, may be owing to something in\r\nthe soil where they grow which they cannot assimilate, and so render a\r\npalatable and wholesome species totally unfit for the table. Whether\r\nsuch specimens, if eaten, would be poisonous or unwholesome, I do not\r\nfeel any temptation to prove. It is not probable that they will ever do\r\nany mischief, for it is incredible that any human being should so\r\npervert his instincts as to swallow such a villanous concoction.\r\n\r\n“Experience and observations like these would perhaps justify the\r\ninference that an innocent species may sometimes be deleterious, on\r\naccount of its taking up some bad element from the soil. But as I have\r\nnever known a case of poisoning in families that are well acquainted\r\nwith the common mushroom or pink gill, that gather the specimens for\r\nthemselves, and have used this article of food annually for many\r\ngenerations, I cannot agree with a suggestion somewhere made by you,\r\nthat perhaps all mushrooms contain a poisonous element, but some of them\r\nin such small quantity as to have no appreciable effect. Now, had you\r\nseen the quantities of stewed mushrooms swallowed at a single meal which\r\nI have seen thus devoured, and with no more harm than from the same\r\namount of oyster or turtle soup, I think you would be forced to the\r\nconclusion that such an amount, even of poisonous infinitesimals, must\r\nhave had some very unpleasant manifestations, or else be a very innocent\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\n“It is said that the sale of the pink gill (_A. campestris_) is\r\nforbidden in the Italian markets, because that species has often proved\r\nto be poisonous. May not this have been occasioned by ignorant and\r\ncareless collectors or by worthless inspectors? To us in America, who\r\nuse this species so freely and fearlessly, the Italian’s curse, ‘May he\r\ndie of a Pratiolo!’ would have no more terror than ‘May he die of\r\naromatic pain.’\r\n\r\n“Our best and standard mushrooms are the pink-gill (_A. campestris_);\r\nsnowball (_A. arvensis_); peach-kernel (_A. amygdalinus_); nut (_A.\r\nprocerus_); French (_A. prunulus_); morel (_M. esculenta_); coral\r\n(_Clavaria_); and omelette (_Lycoperdon giganteum_). These are almost\r\nuniversally in high esteem. Yet tastes differ on these things as on\r\nfruits and vegetables; some putting one, some another, at the head of\r\nthe list, though fond of all and ever ready to use any of them--as one\r\nwho prefers a peach may yet relish an apple. There are some among us who\r\nregard _A. procerus_ as fully equal to _A. campestris_, and I am almost\r\nof the same opinion. When broiled or fried it truly makes a luscious\r\nmorsel. I mention in this connexion, that this species here bears the\r\nname of nut mushroom, from a quality that I do not find mentioned in the\r\nbooks which describe it. The stem when fresh and young has a sweet nutty\r\nflavour, very similar to that of the hazel nut. Is this the case with\r\nyou? Its flavour is so agreeable that I am fond of chewing the fresh\r\nstems. From this peculiarity in connexion with its movable ring, its\r\nform and colours, I deem it a perfectly safe species to recommend for\r\ncollecting. We have no species likely to be mistaken for it, except _A.\r\nrachodes_, and I fully tested the innocence of this before commending\r\nthe first to others. This has been suspected by some, but I have found\r\nit harmless. Though pretty well flavoured, it is not comparable with _A.\r\nprocerus_, and the flesh is so thin and spongy that no one would choose\r\nit when those of more compact texture are to be had. _A. excoriatus_, of\r\nthe same group, is a much preferable species.\r\n\r\n“The Morel is one of my greatest favourites, but this is not found in\r\nquantity except in calcareous districts. A few days since (April 21) I\r\nhad a dozen for supper, the largest number I ever had at one time.\r\n\r\n“The _Lycoperdon giganteum_ is also a great favourite with me, as it is,\r\nindeed, with all my acquaintances who have tried it. It has not the high\r\naroma of some others, but it has a delicacy of flavour that makes it\r\nsuperior to any omelette I have ever eaten. It seems, furthermore, to be\r\nso digestible as to adapt it to the most delicate stomachs. This is the\r\nSouth Down of mushrooms.\r\n\r\n“In this latitude (about 36 degrees) we can find good mushrooms for the\r\ntable during nine or ten months of the year. Including _A. salignus_,\r\nwhich some are quite fond of, we can have them in every month, as this\r\nspecies comes out during any warm spell in winter. _A. campestris_ makes\r\nits appearance here as early as March, but is not in full crop until\r\nSeptember. Several excellent species of the _Tricholoma_ group do not\r\nspring up until after frost sets in, and continue into December. Such is\r\nthe case too with _Boletus collinitus_, which sometimes emerges from the\r\nearth frozen solid.\r\n\r\n“These observations and experiences are confined chiefly to the\r\nCarolinas; though I presume, from casual observations elsewhere, and\r\nfrom information derived from correspondents in other States, that,\r\nmaking some allowance for difference of climate and length of seasons,\r\nwhat I have said is generally applicable to the whole country.”\r\n\r\n\r\n_Why we should not eat Funguses._\r\n\r\nThe following interesting paper from the Rev. J. D. La Touche was read\r\nat a meeting of the Woolhope Naturalists’ Field Club:--\r\n\r\n“It is said that at Rome, when a mortal is about to be raised to the\r\ndignity of sainthood, the precaution is taken of providing a ‘devil’s\r\nadvocate,’ who, by pointing out as strongly as he can all the faults of\r\nthe candidate, secures the fair discussion of both sides of the\r\nquestion, and is a guarantee, moreover, that no unworthy aspirant to\r\nsuch exalted honours should be rashly admitted to them.\r\n\r\n“On the present occasion I make bold to present myself in this unamiable\r\ncapacity. No member, indeed, of this respected Club is seeking\r\ncanonization, yet, a step not less important is contemplated in the\r\nenrolment of a hitherto despised and even abhorred member of the\r\nvegetable kingdom among the list of its edible products; indeed, some\r\nmay consider such a step as of more importance to our race than the\r\napotheosis of a peccant mortal; and therefore it would appear that, if\r\nin the one instance it is desirable that all the peccadilloes of the\r\ncandidate should be exposed, _a fortiori_, it must be so in the other.\r\n\r\n“Let me, then, first observe that these gentlemen at the bar have\r\nactually a very bad character, and that it is not likely that this would\r\nbe the case unless they were really great sinners.\r\n\r\n“Here, some will exclaim, no doubt, ‘Prejudice, my dear sir! vulgar\r\nprejudice is capable of the grossest injustice--ignorant prejudice has\r\ndriven from our tables a delicious article of food, and deprived the\r\npoor of a wholesome diet.’ It is often said that he was a brave man who\r\nfirst ate an oyster, and truly a more uninviting mouthful than it was\r\ncould scarcely be imagined; and yet the fact that it _is_ good and\r\nwholesome soon disposed of any prejudice against it. And is it not\r\nlikely that such would be the case, were the fungus tribe fit for human\r\nfood? Can we suppose any prejudice arising from their leathery looks\r\nwould not evaporate like mists before the morning sun, were they really\r\nthe nutritious and delicious dainties they are described to be by their\r\nenthusiastic advocates?\r\n\r\n“I think it may be observed that the general character which a man bears\r\nis, on the whole, a true one. That big school, the world in which we\r\nlive, contrives, in some way or other, to hit off pretty accurately our\r\naverage merit and take our measure, and though it may make a mistake now\r\nand then in some particular instance, its general estimate is a fair\r\none; and so with funguses. There may be a too-sweeping condemnation of\r\nall kinds of them: nay, it may be even probable that _Agaricus\r\ncampestris_ is not the best that grows, and yet, after all, the\r\nprevalent distrust of the tribe is well founded.\r\n\r\n“When, _e.g._, some family in a parish is known to have been poisoned by\r\neating a wrong sort, it is not surprising, nor can it be called stupid\r\nprejudice, if their neighbours are ever after rather shy of the article\r\nof food which produced that result. But it will be said that the\r\nmischief arose from ignorance--had that family known the marks that\r\ndistinguish between the wholesome and the poisonous kinds this would\r\nnever have taken place. If ever there was a case in which ignorance was\r\nbliss, surely this is it. A short time ago, I accompanied a scientific\r\nfriend in a foray among the funguses, which we made with a special view\r\nto the improvement of our intended repast, and was on that occasion\r\nstruck with the elaborate precautions which seemed to be necessary to\r\nobserve in discriminating the good from the bad. It would almost seem\r\nthat Nature had purposely contrived a labyrinth of ingenious\r\nstumbling-blocks to guard this mysterious product from the insatiable\r\nappetites of mankind; and so it came to pass after all, my good\r\nfriend--who really seemed well up in the subject, and who found at every\r\nturn some well-known test of wholesomeness or otherwise to guide him in\r\nthe specimens we collected--wound up the day by nearly poisoning a\r\nmember of my family: for he had, it appears, mistaken _Boletus flavus_,\r\na violent poison, for the very similar but wholesome and excellent\r\n_Boletus luteus_--the only difference being that the pores of the one\r\nare somewhat smaller and less angular than those of the other. Surely,\r\nin this instance, knowledge (and it was not in his case a little\r\nknowledge either) was a dangerous thing.\r\n\r\n“But still it may be said that there are species the characters of which\r\nare sufficiently well-defined, and that from these, at least, the\r\nstigma ought to be removed. But even so, I would submit one or two\r\nquestions to those who may be inclined to admit this. 1st. Is it so\r\nclear that a fungus which agrees with one person may not be very\r\ninjurious to another? One man has, to use a vulgar expression, the\r\nstomach of a horse. Can I, an average mortal, calculate on possessing\r\nsuch a treasure? I saw with my own eyes my scientific friend eat and\r\nswallow an entire _Boletus flavus_, raw, without any apparent bad\r\neffects either that evening or the following day, whereas a small\r\nportion of the same kind, cooked too (I cannot, however, say _secundum\r\nartem_), produced violent sickness on another individual, who, moreover,\r\nhad never before experienced sickness; indeed, this fact would seem to\r\nsuggest that the stomach may be ‘educated’ by long habit to bear this\r\nnoxious food, and, therefore, that its evil effects (harmless upon\r\norgans well trained) happen when the _experimentum in corpore vili_ is\r\ntried. My friend assures me that he has eaten the highly poisonous\r\n_Boletus satanas_ with no worse effect than a little indigestion the\r\nnext morning. Can, I would ask, the experience of such a seasoned\r\ndigestive apparatus as his be any guide to those who have not gone\r\nthrough the course of training which he has?\r\n\r\n“Again, may it not be possible that the same kind of fungus which in\r\nsome instances is wholesome, may, if grown under different\r\ncircumstances, and supplied with different nutriment, assume very\r\ndifferent properties? And again, are we competent to judge of the\r\nwholesomeness of a particular article of food unless it is tried by a\r\nvery large number of persons--unless it be ‘exhibited,’ to use a medical\r\nterm, on a great variety of constitutions? Indeed, is there not some\r\nground for thinking that such an exhibition would be in many instances\r\nfar from satisfactory?\r\n\r\n“On the whole, it would appear that the advice of an eminent physician,\r\nan ardent admirer of the fungus, was good and sound. When he heard of\r\nthe escape my family had on this occasion, he said that this article of\r\ndiet should be partaken of with ‘great caution.’ And by the way, is not\r\nthis itself a very suspicious expression? ‘Great caution!’ If I am\r\nintroduced to a gentleman, and told at the same time that I must conduct\r\nmyself towards him with ‘great caution’ or he will probably do me some\r\ndeadly mischief, it would hardly be thought a very hearty and promising\r\nintroduction; yet here we are told that this excellent family to which\r\nwe are so warmly introduced has some members belonging to it so\r\nvillanously disposed, that possibly we may pay for our acquaintance with\r\nour lives. This is not very encouraging, and so the course adopted by a\r\nyoung lady who indulges in these experiments, to whom I was speaking the\r\nother day, would seem to be a very prudent one. She says she never\r\npartakes of these dainties till she has seen the effect they have had\r\nupon somebody else! But even so, only picture the ghastly scene which a\r\nbanquet of this kind would present; each guest looking anxiously into\r\nhis neighbour’s face, awaiting in terror the contortions which are to\r\nshow that he has partaken of the fatal dish.”\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. La Touche’s paper should not deter us from using and showing\r\nothers the value of the quantities of _edible_ fungi now generally\r\nallowed to rot in our fields and woods, and nowhere perhaps so abundant\r\nas in the pleasure grounds and woods round country seats, yet, as\r\nimpressing the necessity of using due discrimination in gathering, it\r\nmay be read with advantage by all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n    AGARICUS
