H. Knowlton,\r\n                   _United States Geological Survey._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIsolated pieces of fossil wood are of comparatively common and\r\nwidespread occurrence, especially in the more recent geological deposits\r\nof the West. Not infrequently scattered logs, stumps, and roots of\r\npetrified or lignitized trees are brought to light, but only\r\nexceptionally are they so massed and aggregated as to be worthy of the\r\ndesignation of fossil forests. Examples of such are the celebrated\r\nfossil forests of relatively late geological age near Cairo, Egypt, the\r\nhuge prostrate trunks in the Napa Valley near Calistoga, Cal., and the\r\ngeologically much older and far more extensive forests now widely known\r\nas the Petrified Forest National Monument in Apache County, Ariz. But in\r\nmany respects the most remarkable fossil forests known are those now to\r\nbe described in the Yellowstone National Park. In the forests first\r\nmentioned the trunks and logs were all prostrated before fossilization,\r\nand it is perhaps not quite correct to designate such aggregations as\r\nveritable fossil forests, though they usually are so called. In the\r\nfossil forests of Arizona, for example, which are scattered over many\r\nsquare miles of what is now almost desert, all the trunks show evidence\r\nof having been transported from a distance before they were turned to\r\nstone. Most of them are not even in the position in which they were\r\noriginally entombed, but have been eroded from slightly higher horizons\r\nand have rolled in the greatest profusion to lower levels. As one views\r\nthese Arizona forests from a little distance, with their hundreds, even\r\nthousands, of segments of logs, it is difficult to realize that they are\r\nreally turned to stone and are now exhumed from the earth. The\r\nappearance they present (see fig. 1) is not unlike a “log drive” that\r\nhas been stranded by the receding waters and left until the bark had\r\ndisappeared and many logs had fallen into partial decay. Trunks of many\r\nsizes and lengths are now mingled and scattered about in the wildest\r\nprofusion, and the surface of the ground is carpeted with fragments of\r\nwood that have been splintered and broken from them. In the Yellowstone\r\nNational Park, however, most of the trees were entombed in the upright\r\nposition in which they grew, by the outpouring of various volcanic\r\nmaterials, and as the softer rock surrounding them is gradually worn\r\naway they are left standing erect on the steep hillsides, just as they\r\nstood when they were living: in fact, it is difficult at a little\r\ndistance to distinguish some of these fossil trunks from the\r\nlichen-covered stumps of kindred living species. Such an aggregation of\r\nfossil trunks is therefore well entitled to be called a true fossil\r\nforest. It should not be supposed, however, that these trees still\r\nretain their limbs and smaller branches, for the mass of volcanic\r\nmaterial falling on them stripped them down to bare, upright trunks.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 1.—Fossil Logs in Petrified Forest National\r\n    Monument, Apache County, Arizona.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 2.—Upright fossil trunk in Gallatin Mountains,\r\n    Montana.\r\n    Courtesy of E. C. Alderson.]\r\n\r\nThe fossil forests of the Yellowstone National Park cover an extensive\r\narea in the northern portion of the park, being especially abundant\r\nalong the west side of Lamar River for about 20 miles above its junction\r\nwith the Yellowstone. Here the land rises rather abruptly to a height of\r\napproximately 2,000 feet above the valley floor. It is known locally as\r\nSpecimen Ridge, and forms an approach to Amethyst Mountain. There is\r\nalso a small fossil forest containing a number of standing trunks near\r\nTower Falls, and near the eastern border of the park along Lamar River\r\nin the vicinity of Cache, Calfee, and Miller Creeks, there are many more\r\nor less isolated trunks and stumps of fossil trees, but so far as known\r\nnone of these are equal in interest to the fossil forest on the slopes\r\nof Specimen Ridge.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 3.—Upright trunk and “hoodoo” in Gallatin\r\n    Mountains, Montana.\r\n    Courtesy of E. C. Alderson.]\r\n\r\nThe fossil forests are reached over a road from the Mammoth Hot Springs,\r\nor from Camp Roosevelt near Tower Falls, and they are in their way quite\r\nas wonderful and worthy of attention as many of the other features for\r\nwhich the Yellowstone National Park is so justly celebrated.\r\n\r\nRecently another extensive fossil forest has been found on the divide\r\nbetween the Gallatin and Yellowstone Rivers in the Gallatin Range of\r\nmountains, in Park and Gallatin Counties, Mont. This forest, which lies\r\njust outside the boundary of the Yellowstone National Park, is said to\r\ncover 35,000 acres and to contain some wonderfully well preserved\r\nupright trunks, many of them very large, equaling or perhaps even\r\nsurpassing in size some of those within the limits of the park. Two of\r\nthe best preserved of these trunks are shown in figures 2 and 3, which\r\nare here reproduced by the kindness of Mr. E. C. Alderson, of Bozeman,\r\nMont.\r\n\r\nIn the beds of the streams and gulches coming down into the Lamar River\r\nfrom Specimen Ridge and the fossil forests one may observe numerous\r\npieces of fossil wood, which may be traced for a long distance down the\r\nLamar and Yellowstone Rivers. The farther these pieces of wood have been\r\ntransported downstream, the more they have been worn and rounded, until\r\nultimately they become smooth, rounded “pebbles” of the stream bed. The\r\npieces of wood become more numerous and fresher in appearance upstream\r\ntoward the bluffs, until at the foot of the cliffs in some places there\r\nare hundreds, perhaps thousands of tons that have but recently fallen\r\nfrom the walls above. One traversing the valley of the Lamar River may\r\nsee at many places numerous upright fossil trunks in the faces of nearly\r\nvertical walls. These trunks are not all at a particular level but occur\r\nat irregular heights: in fact a section cut down through these 2,000\r\nfeet of beds would disclose a succession of fossil forests (see fig. 4).\r\nThat is to say, after the first forest grew and was entombed, there was\r\na time without volcanic outburst—a period long enough to permit a second\r\nforest to grow above the first. This in turn was covered by volcanic\r\nmaterial and preserved, to be followed again by a period of quiet, and\r\nthese more or less regular alternations of volcanism and forest growth\r\ncontinued throughout the time the beds were in process of formation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GEOLOGIC RELATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile these fossil forests were growing and being entombed, much of the\r\narea now within the limits of the park, as well as large adjacent areas,\r\nwas the scene of tremendous geologic activities. After the Cretaceous\r\nperiod (see diagram p. 28), there was a time of great volcanic activity,\r\nwhich appears to have lasted until perhaps the beginning of the glacial\r\nepoch. There were many active volcanoes just west, north, and west of\r\nthe park, and some in the park itself. From these volcanoes vast\r\nquantities of material were poured out, building up in places whole\r\nmountain ranges. Thus the major portion of the great Absaroka Range,\r\njust east of the park, as it appears to-day, was built up of volcanic\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 4.—Ideal section through 2,000 feet of beds of\r\n    Specimen Ridge, showing succession of buried forest. After Holmes.]\r\n\r\nMr. Arnold Hague gives the following graphic account of this and\r\nadjacent areas:\r\n\r\n  From one end to the other the Absarokas present a high, imposing\r\n  plateau, with elevations ranging from 10,000 to over 12,000 feet above\r\n  sea level. The entire mass is made up almost exclusively of Tertiary\r\n  igneous rocks. * * * Degradation of the mass has taken place on a\r\n  grand scale. Vast quantities of volcanic ejectmenta have been removed\r\n  from the summit, but no reliable data exist by which the amount can be\r\n  estimated even approximately. All the higher portions have been\r\n  sculptured by glacial ice. Enormous amphitheaters have been carved out\r\n  of the loose agglomerates, and peaks, pinnacles, and relics of great\r\n  table-lands testify in some measure to the forces of erosion. The\r\n  plateau is scored by a complete network of deep valleys and gorges,\r\n  which dissect it in every direction, and lay bare the structure of the\r\n  vast volcanic pile.[1]\r\n\r\nWithin the park there is evidence of similar volcanic activity, and it\r\nis clear that the basin between the encircling ranges was filled to its\r\npresent elevation by volcanic flows, which formed the present park\r\nplateau. The area within which the fossil forests are now found was\r\napparently in the beginning an irregular but relatively flat basin, on\r\nthe floor of which after a time there grew the first forest. Then there\r\ncame from some of the volcanoes, probably those to the north, an\r\noutpouring of ashes, mud flows, and other material which entirely buried\r\nthe forest, but so gradually that the trees were simply submerged by the\r\nincoming material, few of them being prostrated. On the raised floor of\r\nthe basin, after a time, the next forest came into existence, only to be\r\nin turn engulfed as the first had been, and so on through the period\r\nrepresented by the 2,000 feet or more of similar beds. The series of\r\nentombed forests affords a means of making at least a rough estimate of\r\nthe time required for the upbuilding of what is now Specimen Ridge and\r\nits extensions. (See p. 27.)\r\n\r\nDuring the time this 2,000 feet of material was being accumulated, and\r\nsince then to the present day, there has been relatively little warping\r\nof the earth’s crust at this point; that is, the beds were then, and\r\nstill are, practically horizontal, so that the fossil forests, as they\r\nare being gradually uncovered, still stand upright.\r\n\r\nWhen the volcanic activities had finally ceased, the ever-working\r\ndisintegrating forces of nature began to tear and wear down this\r\naccumulated material, eroding the beds on a grand scale. Deep canyons\r\nand gulches have been trenched, and vast quantities of the softer\r\nmaterials have been carried away by the streams and again deposited on\r\nlower levels or transported to great and unknown distances.\r\n\r\nAs the material in which the fossil forests are now entombed consist of\r\nashes, mud flows, breccia, and the like, not all the beds are of the\r\nsame texture end hardness, so that erosion has acted unevenly on them\r\nand has produced many peculiar rock forms. The grotesque so-called\r\n“hoodoos” have been carved out in this manner. The fossil trunks, being\r\nusually harder than the surrounding matrix in which they are embedded,\r\nhave more firmly resisted erosion and now project to different heights\r\nabove the general level. In exposed beds that are nearly or quite\r\nhorizontal, disintegration has acted at nearly equal pace on the trunks\r\nand on the matrix, so that the trunks are nearly or quite on a level\r\nwith the surrounding surface. On steep hillsides, however, from which\r\nall loose material is easily and quickly removed, some of the fossil\r\ntrunks stand up to a height of 20 or 30 feet. If the beds had been\r\ntilted at a considerable angle, these trunks could project from the\r\nsurface for only a short distance before their weight would break them\r\noff, showing again the remarkably stable conditions that have continued\r\nsince the trunks were covered up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           AMETHYST MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fossil forest that was first brought to scientific attention is on\r\nthe northern slope of Amethyst Mountain, opposite the mouth of Soda\r\nButte Creek, 12 miles southeast of Camp Roosevelt.

Holmes, the discoverer of these fossil\r\nforests, shows the impression first made by them:\r\n\r\n  As we ride up the trail that meanders the smooth river bottom [Lamar\r\n  River] we have but to turn our attention to the cliffs on the right\r\n  hand to discover a multitude of the bleached trunks of the ancient\r\n  forests. In the steeper middle portion of the mountain face, rows of\r\n  upright trunks stand out on the ledges like the columns of a ruined\r\n  temple. On the more gentle slopes farther down, but where it is still\r\n  too steep to support vegetation, save a few pines, the petrified\r\n  trunks fairly cover the surface, and were at first supposed by us to\r\n  be shattered remains of a recent forest.[2]\r\n\r\nThese trunks may easily be seen from the road along the Lamar River,\r\nabout a mile away. They stand upright—as Holmes has said, like the\r\npillars of some ruined temple—and a closer view shows that there is a\r\nsuccession of these forests, one above another. In the foothills and\r\nseveral hundred feet above the valley there is a perpendicular wall of\r\nvolcanic breccia, which in some places attains a height of nearly 100\r\nfeet. The fossil trunks may be seen in this wall in many places, all of\r\nthem standing upright, in the position in which they grew. Some of these\r\ntrunks, which are 2 to 4 feet in diameter and 20 to 40 feet high, are so\r\nfar weathered out of the rock as to appear just ready to fall: others\r\nare only slightly exposed: niches mark the places from which others have\r\nalready fallen: and the foot of the cliff is piled high with fragments\r\nof various sizes.\r\n\r\nAbove this cliff fossil trunks appear in great numbers and in regular\r\nsuccession. As they are all perfectly silicified, they are more\r\nresistant than the surrounding matrix and consequently stand above it.\r\nMost of them are only a few inches above the surface, but occasionally\r\none rises as high as 5 or 6 feet. The largest trunk observed in the park\r\nis found in this locality. It is a little over 10 feet in diameter, a\r\nmeasurement that includes a part of the bark. It is very much broken\r\ndown, especially in the interior, probably having been so disintegrated\r\nbefore it was fossilized. It projects about 6 feet above the surface.\r\n\r\nAt many places about Amethyst Mountain there are numerous fragments of\r\nfossil wood and many hollow trunks. The material in which they had been\r\nembedded has been eroded away, and they lie around in somewhat the same\r\nattitudes that are shown by all the trunks in the Arizona fossil\r\nforests, but there is little doubt that they were originally erect and\r\nhave simply fallen by their own weight because of the removal of the\r\nmaterial around them.\r\n\r\nMany of the trunks here, as well as elsewhere in the park, had decayed\r\nin the center before they were fossilized, and some of the hollow\r\ninteriors are filled with clusters and rosettes of beautiful crystals of\r\namethyst, which doubtless suggested the name given to the adjacent\r\nmountain. Much of this finely preserved wood, as well as the trunks\r\ncontaining the crystals of amethyst, was broken up and carried away by\r\ncollectors of minerals and curiosities before the Government control in\r\nthe park was made sufficiently rigid to insure proper protection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            SPECIMEN RIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn many respects the most remarkable of the fossil forests is on the\r\nnorthwest end of Specimen Ridge, about a mile southeast of Junction\r\nButte and about opposite the mouth of Slough Creek. So far as known,\r\nthis forest was first brought to scientific attention by Mr. E. C.\r\nAlderson, of Bozeman, Mont., and the writer, who discovered it in\r\nAugust, 1887. It is found on the higher part of the ridge, and covers\r\nseveral acres. The trees are exposed at various heights on the very\r\nsteep hillsides, and one remarkable feature of the forest is that most\r\nof them project well above the surface.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest and best preserved trees stands at the very summit of\r\nthe slope (see title page). This trunk, which is that of a giant\r\nredwood, is 26½ feet in circumference without the bark and about 12 feet\r\nin height. The portion of this huge trunk preserved is the base, and it\r\nexhibits to a considerable degree the swelling or buttressing so well\r\nknown in the living redwood. The roots, which are as large as the trunks\r\nof ordinary trees, are now embedded in solid rock.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 5.—Upright trunks in Specimen Ridge fossil\r\n    forest.]\r\n\r\nOn the steep hillside a short distance below the big tree just mentioned\r\nare the two trunks shown in figure 5. They are about 2 feet in diameter\r\nand 25 feet high, and stand some 20 feet apart, and we may imagine them\r\nto have formed the doorposts of the “ancient temple” of which Holmes\r\nspeaks. Both these trunks are without the bark. On the left of the\r\nfigure is one of the huge irregular masses of rock that has been carved\r\nout by erosion.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 6.—Trunk of fossil pine showing bark. Specimen\r\n    Ridge fossil forest.]\r\n\r\nIn figure 6 is shown another trunk about 3 feet in diameter and nearly\r\n30 feet high. In several places along the trunk the thick bark may be\r\nnoted. This tree is a pine, as are the two last described, and slightly\r\nbelow and behind it are two living pine trees, which are about the size\r\nit must have been when living. Another trunk, some 12 feet in height, is\r\nshown in figure 7, and in figure 8 there may be noted a standing trunk\r\nand above it another that has recently fallen.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 7.—Trunk showing bark. Specimen Ridge fossil\r\n    forest.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 8.—Upright and prostrate trunks, Specimen Ridge\r\n    fossil forest.]\r\n\r\nThe height attained by the trees of this fossil forest can not be\r\nascertained with certainty, since the tallest trunk now standing is only\r\nabout 30 feet high, but every one observed is obviously broken off, and\r\ndoes not show even the presence of limbs. Perhaps the nearest approach\r\nto a measure of the height is afforded by a trunk (shown in fig. 10)\r\nthat happened to have been prostrated before fossilization. This trunk,\r\nwhich is 4 feet in diameter, is exposed for a length of about 40 feet,\r\nand as it shows no apparent diminution in size within this distance it\r\nis safe to assume that the tree could hardly have been less than 100\r\nfeet high and very probably may have been higher. This trunk is\r\nwonderfully preserved. As may be seen from the illustration, it has\r\nbroken up by splitting along the grain of the wood into great numbers of\r\nlittle pieces, which closely resemble pieces of “kindling wood” split\r\nfrom a clear-grained block. In fact, at a distance of a few yards it\r\nwould be impossible to distinguish this fossil “kindling wood” from that\r\nsplit from a living tree.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10.—Prostrate trunk of fossil redwood, Specimen\r\n    Ridge fossil forest.]\r\n\r\nThe large redwood trunk already mentioned (title-page) as being nearly\r\n10 feet in diameter may be compared with its living relative of the\r\nPacific coast in order to calculate its probable height. The living\r\nredwood is usually 10 to 15 feet in diameter and ranges in height from\r\n200 to 310 feet, and as the two are so very closely related there is no\r\nreason to suppose that the fossil trunk was of less height, but by a\r\nmoderate estimate it may be accredited with a minimum height of 200\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MAP OF YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK\r\n    Norris O Denotes Ranger Station\r\n    ←Direction of Travel\r\n    Distances given are between main points by road\r\n    NOTE THE MILE-POST SIGNS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              TOWER FALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most accessible fossil forest, marked \"Petrified Trees\" on the map,\r\nis west of the Tower Falls Ranger Station and Camp Roosevelt on the road\r\nfrom the Grand Canyon to Mammoth Hot Springs, by way of Mount Washburn.\r\nIt is on the middle slope of a hill that rises about 1,000 feet above\r\nthe little valley and may be reached by a branch road from the main loop\r\nroad. As the traveler approaches the forest he will observe a number of\r\ntrunks standing upright among the stumps and trunks of living trees, and\r\nso much resembling them that a near view is necessary to convince him\r\nthat they are really fossil trunks. Only two rise to a considerable\r\nheight above the surface. The larger one is about 15 feet high and 13\r\nfeet in circumference (fig. 11): the other is a little smaller. As the\r\nroots are not exposed, it is impossible to determine the position of the\r\npart in view or the original diameter of the trees, as the bark is\r\nnowhere preserved.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 11.—Fossil trunk near Tower Falls.\r\n    Photograph by F. J. Haynes.]\r\n\r\nAbove these standing trunks lie many others, which the disintegrating\r\nforces of nature break up into small fragments and keep at about the\r\nsame level as that of their surrounding matrix. Some of these trunks\r\nrise only a few inches from the surface: others are nearly covered by\r\nshifting débris. Their diameter ranges from 1 to 14 feet, and they are\r\nso perfectly preserved that the rings of growth can easily be counted.\r\nThe internal structure is also in most trunks nearly as perfect as when\r\nthe trees were living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CACHE CREEK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe forest that is next in size to the one a mile southeast of Junction\r\nButte is on Cache Creek, about 7 miles above its mouth. It is on the\r\nsouth bank of the creek and covers several acres. The trunks are\r\nscattered from bottom to top of the slopes through a height of probably\r\n800 feet. Most of the trunks are upright, but only a few project more\r\nthan 2 or 3 feet above the surface. The largest one observed was 6 feet\r\nin height and 4 feet in diameter. Most of these trunks appear to the\r\nnaked eye to be conifers, but a number are obviously dicotyledons—that\r\nis, they were deciduous-leaved trees. The conifers, however, were the\r\npredominant element in this as in the other fossil forests.\r\n\r\nThe slopes of the Thunderer, the mountain so prominently in view from\r\nSoda Butte on the south, also bear numerous fossil trunks. Most of them\r\nare upright, but only a very few project more than 2 feet above the\r\nsurface. No remarkably large trunks were observed at this locality, the\r\naverage diameter being perhaps less than 2 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           OTHER LOCALITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMount Norris, which is hardly to be separated from the Thunderer, also\r\nbears a small fossil forest. The trees are of about the same size and\r\ncharacter as those in the larger mountain. Fossil forests of greater or\r\nless extent, composed mainly of upright trunks, are exposed also on\r\nBaronett Peak, Bison Peak, Abiathar Peak, Crescent Hill, and Miller\r\nCreek. In fact, there is hardly a square mile of the area of the\r\nnortheastern portion of the park that is without its fossil forest,\r\nscattered trunks, or erratic fragments.\r\n\r\nThe vast area east of the Yellowstone Lake and the region still farther\r\neast, beyond the limits of the park, have not been thoroughly explored,\r\nbut enough is known to make it certain that these areas contain more or\r\nless fossil wood. The stream beds in these areas in many places contain\r\nfragments of fossil wood, which indicates that trunks of trees must be\r\nnear at hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE PROCESS OF FOSSILIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these forests were fossilized may next be\r\nconsidered. Though the whole history of the process is not fully\r\nunderstood, it was undoubtedly dependent on or at least greatly\r\nfacilitated by the presence of volcanic and hydrothermal activity, which\r\nwas doubtless then, as it is to some extent now, a marked feature of the\r\npark region. At least a hint of the probable process is afforded by the\r\naction now going on in the hot spring areas. Many of those areas are\r\nclosely surrounded by forests, and unless the action of the springs is\r\nvery violent the trees may be growing only a short distance away.\r\nOccasionally a hot spring may break out near the edge of a forest, the\r\nfirst effect being, of course, to kill the trees. In a few years, by the\r\naction of the ordinary processes of decay, a tree so killed may have\r\nlost its bark and most of its smaller branches. The hot water which\r\nconstantly or intermittently surrounds the tree contains a considerable\r\namount of silica in solution, and as this hot silica-charged water is\r\ndrawn up into the wood by capillarity the silica may be deposited in the\r\ncells of the wood after the water cools or evaporates. The first result\r\nwill be a more or less complete cast of the interior of the cells and\r\nvessels of the wood. This much of the process has actually been\r\nobserved, but as decay is more rapid than silicification, the wood\r\ncrumbles to dust before petrifaction is complete. If the trunk could be\r\nsurrounded by ashes or mud and thus protected from atmospheric action,\r\nit might in time be completely turned to stone.\r\n\r\nThe fossil forests are surrounded by a matrix that is known as an acidic\r\nlava—that is, a siliceous lava—which contains abundant silica in\r\nsolution. The first part of the process of silicification may well have\r\nbeen that above described as taking place in the hot spring areas at the\r\npresent day—that is, the silica would be deposited in all the cells and\r\nvessels of the wood, making an accurate cast of all open spaces. Then,\r\nwhile the slow process of decay went on, as each particle of organic\r\nmatter was removed its place was taken by the silica, until, finally,\r\nall the wood substance had disappeared and its place atom by atom had\r\nbeen taken by silica.\r\n\r\nBy this or a similar process the wood has been preserved or fossilized\r\nwith remarkable fidelity: in fact, thin sections or slices of the fossil\r\nwood may be studied under the higher powers of the microscope with\r\nalmost or quite as much completeness and satisfaction as if they were\r\nsections cut from a piece of living wood. Each cell and vessel, with its\r\ncharacteristic pits and markings, is preserved exactly as it grew. Some\r\nof the wood, however, was evidently more or less decayed before it was\r\nfossilized, or else decay worked faster than replacement, so that in\r\nsome fragments the structure is not so clearly preserved. Many of the\r\ntrunks were subjected to pressure before replacement was complete, and\r\nthis has crushed or distorted the cells. On the whole, however, the wood\r\nis exceptionally well preserved, as may be seen in figures 12, 13, 14,\r\nand 15. These are all magnified 100 diameters and were photographed\r\ndirectly from the thin sections—that is, they are photomicrographs—and\r\nhave not been retouched in any manner. Figure 12 shows a transverse\r\nsection of the wood of the large redwood trunk that has been so often\r\nmentioned (see title page). The section is cut through one of the growth\r\nrings, which consists of 12 or 15 rows of very thick-walled cells. The\r\nlarge, regular thin-walled cells, which begin abruptly above the growth\r\nring, belong to the spring wood—that is, the wood first formed after\r\ngrowth starts in spring, when the supply of nourishment is abundant. If\r\nthere is sufficient moisture and all conditions are favorable this\r\nvigorous growth of wood cells may continue without interruption until\r\nthe approach of cold or dry weather, but not infrequently there may be a\r\nbrief shortage of moisture, and this is reflected in the formation of a\r\nfew rows of thicker-walled cells. Such a condition may be observed in\r\nthe present specimen, in which a slight, partial ring may be seen at\r\nsome distance above the main ring.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 12.—Thin section of wood of fossil redwood\r\n    (Sequoia magnifica), showing growth ring. Section transverse.\r\n    Magnified 100 diameters.]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 13.—Thin section of wood of fossil pine\r\n    (Pityoxylon amethystinum), showing growth ring and resin tube.\r\n    Section transverse.

Magnified 100 diameters.]\r\n\r\nThe very perfect preservation of the wood of one of the pines\r\n(_Pityoxylon amethystinum_) is shown in figure 13, a view of a section\r\ncut through a part of a growth ring and into the spring and summer wood,\r\nthe rings in this species being so broad that it is impossible to show a\r\ncomplete one. The opening near the bottom of the figure shows one of the\r\nlarge resin ducts, which, in the living wood, is filled with the “pitch”\r\nthat so readily exudes when a branch is cut or broken. A longitudinal\r\nsection of the other species of pine (_Pityoxylon aldersoni_) is shown\r\nin figure 14. The many little rows of superimposed cells in the midst of\r\nthe long wood cells are the cut-off ends of what are known as medullary\r\nrays—that is, the little plates of cells that connect pith and bark. One\r\nof the resin cells cut in the long direction is shown near the center of\r\nthe figure; the contents are much darker than that of the wood cells.\r\n\r\nThe very great difference between the sections of coniferous wood just\r\ndescribed and the wood of a deciduous tree is brought out in figure 15,\r\nwhich is a longitudinal section of a laurel (_Laurinoxylon pulchrum_).\r\nIn this the wood cells are relatively much smaller and shorter, and the\r\nmedullary rays are in several irregular rows. The large dotted duct near\r\nthe middle of the figure is a feature not present in coniferous trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          SPECIES REPRESENTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn enumeration of the kinds of trees that are represented by the woods\r\nin the fossil forests of the Yellowstone National Park will naturally be\r\ndemanded. A superficial or macroscopic examination of these trunks would\r\nnot permit a close decision as to the kind of wood: in fact, it would\r\nhardly be possible to do more than separate them by this means into\r\nconiferous and dicotyledonous trees. But by studying thin sections under\r\nthe microscope it is possible to distinguish the different kinds with\r\nreasonable accuracy. As the result of such study the following species\r\nhave been detected:\r\n\r\n  Magnificent redwood (Sequoia magnifica).\r\n  Alderson’s pine (Pityoxylon aldersoni).\r\n  Amethyst pine (Pityoxylon amethystinum).\r\n  Laurel (Laurinoxylon pulchrum).\r\n  Aromatic bay (Perseoxylon aromaticum),\r\n  Hayden’s sycamore (Plantaninium haydeni).\r\n  Knowlton’s sycamore (Plantaninium knowltoni).\r\n  Felix’s buckthorn (Rhamnacinium radiatum).\r\n  Lamar oak (Quercinium lamarense).\r\n  Knowlton’s oak (Quercinium knowltoni).\r\n\r\nAlthough only three kinds of coniferous trees have thus far been found\r\nin the fossil forests of the park, fully 95 per cent of all the trunks\r\nbelong to these three species. The preponderance of conifers is probably\r\ndue to the facts that they were presumably more abundant in the\r\nbeginning, and that, in general, coniferous wood decays less rapidly\r\nthan that of most of deciduous-leaved trees. But the conditions were so\r\nfavorable for preserving any wood that it is perhaps strange that not\r\nmore trunks of deciduous-leaved trees have been found there. As it is,\r\nhowever, a greater number are known from the park than from any other\r\nregion. Thus, the Arizona fossil forests embraced only two species of\r\ndeciduous-leaved trees: the Calistoga (California) wood only one\r\nspecies, and the forest at Cairo, Egypt, only four species.\r\n\r\nThe 10 species of trees represented in the fossil forests of the park\r\nare by no means the only fossil plants that have been found. The\r\nfine-grained ashes and volcanic mud in which the forests were entombed\r\ncontain also great numbers of impressions of plants, many of them very\r\nperfectly preserved. Most of these are impressions of foliage, such as\r\nfronds and leaves, but they include also roots, stems, branches,\r\nfruiting organs, and even what is believed to be the petals of a large\r\nmagnolia flower. About 150 different kinds of fossil plants have been\r\nfound in the park, 80 in the same beds with the forests, and most of the\r\nothers in slightly higher and younger beds. The list embraces 10 ferns,\r\namong them a fine chain fern (Woodwardia), several aspleniums, and a\r\nbeautiful little climbing fern (Lygodium). The horse-tails (Equisetum)\r\nare represented by 4 species. The conifers include no less than 6\r\nspecies of pines (Pinus), a yew (Taxodium), and 2 sequoias. These have\r\nbeen identified either from the foliage or the cones, and it is more\r\nthan likely that some of the specimens may represent organs that\r\nbelonged to trees represented by the fossil trunks, but as they have\r\nnever been found connected they have been described separately. The\r\nmonocotyledons, or plants with parallel-veined leaves, are represented\r\nby only a few forms, such as a single large grass (Phragmites), a few\r\nsedges (Cyperacites), a smilax, and a curious broad-leaved banana-like\r\nplant (Musophyllum). The dicotyledons, or deciduous-leaved plants, make\r\nup the bulk of the flora and include walnuts (Juglans), hickory nuts\r\n(Hicoria), bay berries (Myrica), poplars (Populus), willows (Salix),\r\nbirches (Betula), hazel nuts (Corylus), beech nuts (Fagus), chestnuts\r\n(Castanea), oaks (Quercus), elms (Ulmus), figs (Ficus), breadfruits\r\n(Artocarpus), magnolias (Magnolia), laurels (Laurus), bays (Persea),\r\ncinnamons (Cinnamomum), sycamores (Plantanus), acacias (Acacia), sumachs\r\n(Rhus), bittersweet (Celastrus), maples (Acer), soap berries (Sapindus),\r\nbuckthorns (Rhammus), grapes (Cissus), basswood (Tilia), aralias\r\n(Aralia), dogwoods (Cornus), persimmons (Diospyros), ash (Fraxinus), and\r\na number of others without vernacular names.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    COMPARISON WITH LIVING FORESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA brief comparison of the fossil forests with the forests now living in\r\nthe Yellowstone National Park may be of some interest. The present\r\nforests are prevailingly coniferous, the most abundant and widely\r\ndistributed tree being the lodgepole pine (_Pinus murrayana_), which\r\nforms dense forests over much of the plateau region. It is distinguished\r\nby having the leaves in clusters of two. It is a tree with a slender\r\ntrunk, usually 70 or 80 feet high, though in exceptionally favorable\r\nlocalities it may reach a height of 150 feet. Its diameter rarely\r\nexceeds 2 or 3 feet. The areas ravaged by forest fires are usually\r\nreforested by this pine alone, and the young trees come up so close\r\ntogether as to form thickets that can scarcely be penetrated.\r\n\r\nThere are two other pines in the park, both white pines, allied to the\r\ncommon white pine of the Eastern States, and like it both have the\r\nleaves in clusters of 5. One, known as the Rocky Mountain white pine\r\n(_Pinus flexilis_) is a small tree, only 40 or 50 feet in height, and\r\nusually grows singly or in small groves. The other, called the Western\r\nwhite pine (_Pinus albicaulis_), is still smaller, being usually 20 to\r\n30 feet high, and has a short trunk some 2 to 4 feet in diameter. It\r\ngrows on high slopes and exposed ridges.\r\n\r\nPerhaps next in abundance to the lodgepole pine is the white or\r\nEngelmann spruce (_Picea engelmanni_), a tall, handsome tree with\r\ndisagreeable smelling foliage. Another rather abundant tree is the\r\nDouglas spruce, or red fir (_Pseudotsuga mucronata_), which, where best\r\ndeveloped on the Pacific coast, attains a height of 200 feet, though in\r\nthe drier interior it is rarely over 80 or 100 feet high. There are also\r\ntwo species of fir, the white fir (_Abies grandis_) and the Balsam fir\r\n(_Abies lasiocarpa_), and a single juniper (_Juniperus communis\r\nsiberica_), which is often scarcely more than a shrub.\r\n\r\nThe deciduous-leaved trees are almost a negligible element in the\r\npresent park flora, being confined to an occasional cottonwood (_Populus\r\nangustifolia_) at the lower elevations, along the Yellowstone River, and\r\nsmall groves of the quaking aspen (_Populus tremuloides_). Along the\r\nstreams and in wet places there are many species of willow (Salix) and\r\nseveral alders (Alnus), and in mountain bogs and valleys there is a\r\nsmall birch (_Betula glandulosa_). There are, of course, many small\r\nshrubs, such as gooseberries, currants, and roses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       AGE OF THE FOSSIL FORESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question is often asked, How old are the fossil forests? It is, of\r\ncourse, impossible to fix their age exactly in years, though it is easy\r\nenough to place them in the geologic time scale. The stratified rocks\r\nthat make up the crust of the earth, from the oldest we know to the most\r\nrecent, have been divided by geologists into a number of major divisions\r\nor systems, each—except perhaps the oldest—containing the remains of\r\ncertain kinds of plants and animals. The accompanying diagram (fig. 16),\r\nshows these major time divisions, arranged in their proper sequence from\r\nthe lowest to the highest. The star (*) in this geologic time scale\r\nindicates the age of the rocks in which the fossil forests were\r\nentombed. It shows that they were buried during the Tertiary period.\r\nThis period is divided into four epochs, the oldest called Eocene,\r\nhaving been succeeded in turn by the Oligocene, the Miocene, and the\r\nPliocene, which just precedes the Pleistocene or glacial epoch. The\r\nforests of the Yellowstone National Park are found in the Miocene series\r\nof the Tertiary. As compared with the eons of geologic time that\r\npreceded it the Miocene is relatively very recent, though, if the\r\nvarious estimates of the age of the earth that have been made by\r\ngeologists are anywhere near correct it may well have been a million\r\nyears ago. It must be remembered, however, that this estimate involves\r\nmore or less speculation based on a number of factors which may or may\r\nnot have been correctly interpreted.\r\n\r\nA study of the fossil trees themselves gives at least a rough\r\napproximation as to the length of time it may have taken to accumulate\r\nthe beds in which they are now buried. As already mentioned, there is a\r\nsuccession of forests, one above another, through a thickness of 2,000\r\nfeet of strata. The unit of the measure of the time is the time taken by\r\neach forest to grow. Pine trees of the types represented in the fossil\r\ntrunks require 200 or 300 years to reach maturity, and redwoods may\r\nrequire from 500 to 1,000 years. Twelve or more of these forest levels\r\nhave been found. By multiplying this number by the minimum age of the\r\ntrees (200 years) we shall have 2,400 years, and by multiplying it by\r\nthe maximum age of the redwood (1,000 years) we shall have 12,000 years\r\nas the possible time during which these forests flourished. It is\r\npossible that the truth lies somewhere between these extremes.\r\n\r\n            Fig. 16.—Geologic divisions.\r\n       Era.            Period.          Epoch.\r\n\r\n  Cenozoic.

It is obvious that the\r\npresent flora of the Yellowstone National Park has comparatively little\r\nrelation to the Tertiary flora and can not be considered the descendant\r\nof it. It is also clear that the climatic conditions must have greatly\r\nchanged since Tertiary time. The Tertiary flora appears to have come\r\nfrom the south, but the present flora is evidently of more northern\r\norigin. The climate during Tertiary time, as indicated by the\r\nvegetation, was temperate or warm-temperate, not unlike that of Virginia\r\nor the Carolinas at the present time, and the presence of numerous\r\nspecies of figs, a supposed bread-fruit tree, cinnamons, bays, and other\r\nsouthern plants indicates that it may have been almost subtropical.\r\nHowever, the conditions that were favorable to this seemingly\r\nsubtropical growth may have been different from the conditions now\r\nnecessary for the growth of similar vegetation. It may be that these\r\nsupposed subtropical plants were at that time so constituted as to grow\r\nin a temperate land, and that they may have become tropical in recent\r\ntimes. Following this general line of thought it may be said that\r\nalthough the Tertiary vegetation of the Yellowstone National Park would\r\nnow be regarded as indicating a temperate or even warmer climate, the\r\nactual climate may not have been subtropical. It is certain, however,\r\nthat the conditions were very different from those now prevailing in the\r\npark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               PUBLICATIONS ON YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\n             DISTRIBUTED FREE BY THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE.\r\n\r\nThe following publication may be obtained free on written application to\r\nthe Director of the National Park Service:\r\n\r\nCircular of General Information, Yellowstone National Park (issued\r\n      yearly).
