Pratt.\r\n\r\nThe supply of wild fur has already fallen behind the demand and the time\r\nis in sight when wild fur will form but a small per cent of that in use.\r\n\r\nAll furs trapped in steel traps are less beautiful because the animal\r\nsuffers. It is a well-known fact that the less the animal suffers, the\r\nbetter the fur.\r\n\r\nThe time is not far away when nearly all fur will be grown on\r\nfur-ranches. Fur-farming unquestionably has a great future as an\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nWithout detailing countless failures; it is well to begin by disposing\r\nof the wrong idea that most people begin with, that all they need to do\r\nis secure an island or a big fenced area, and throw in much feed to a\r\nbunch of selected fur-bearers, and reap a harvest of so many pelts each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe absurdity of this is seen if we compare it to a horse-breeder who\r\nwould put a high fence around a large pasture and turn in a couple\r\nstallions and a dozen mares; throw in much feed daily, and expect a\r\nharvest of so many colts, each year.\r\n\r\nNo,—success depends on general supervision and control of each\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nSkunks raise a better coat in captivity than when wild, because their\r\nfood is gotten without hunting for it, and are beyond danger of man,\r\ndogs, and other intruders. Striped skunks ten years ago sold for one\r\ndollar per pair, while only two dollars per pair was paid for “star\r\nblacks”. Three years ago or more these prices had doubled, and a skunk\r\nwith his scent glands out was even more valuable.\r\n\r\nOne male and two females is a good lot to begin with, which would\r\nincrease to twenty young the first year, and one hundred and fifty the\r\nsecond, providing one could wait that long, and one certainly could not\r\nexpect any dividend until the fifth year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             2.—The Ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn acre of ground is sufficient to begin with, but one must have it\r\nsituated so one could increase to perhaps ten acres. It should be high,\r\ndry and sandy, with some grass in the plot, and not too remote from a\r\nrailway station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             3.—The Fence.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn inexpensive fence to begin with may be made by setting posts in the\r\nground close together, but strongly. I recommend a fence made of wire\r\nnetting or steel set or inbedded in the ground from one to two feet.\r\nFirst, dig a trench about one foot wide and two feet deep, and put heavy\r\nrock in the bottom and thus, with the rock below the wire there will be\r\nno way that the skunks can escape by digging.\r\n\r\nThe posts should be set ten feet apart. If set farther the wire will\r\nhave a tendency to sag. The wire should be of one and a half inch mesh\r\nfor the main fence, and one inch mesh for the breeding yards, as young\r\nskunks sometimes escape through a one and a half inch mesh. No. 16, or\r\n18, gauge wire from four to eight feet in height should be used. Any\r\nsmaller gauge than the above mentioned is not durable enough.\r\n\r\nA wire or board inhang of twelve inches, should be placed at the top\r\nrejecting in so the animals can’t climb out. This is attached by slats\r\nnailed along the tops of the posts and the wire nailed to them. Steel\r\nsheeting needs no inhang, because it is so that the skunks cannot get a\r\nfoothold.\r\n\r\nIf the skunks dig at night to get out fill up the holes as soon as\r\npossible and thus discourage the workers.\r\n\r\nThe big pen or large enclosure, serves as a range for the barren\r\nfemales, males, and young skunks during autumn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                4.—Pens.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany breeders consider pens better and cheaper than dens. These are\r\nlittle runs about ten feet square, separated only by a three foot\r\nnetting which has an inhang or overhang as it is some times called, of a\r\nfoot on each side, so the skunks cannot climb in or out. If boards are\r\nused for pens inside the big fence no overhang is needed. All pens\r\nshould be completely floored with mesh wire three or four inches under\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                5.—Dens.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery cage or pen needs a movable den that is dry, sanitary, portable,\r\neasy for observation, and warm. This last feature is important, for\r\nskunks are sensitive to cold which causes pneumonia. The dens should be\r\nwell supplied with straw and rags, (avoid hay) because the seeds are\r\ninjurious to the nostrils.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            6.—Cage Litter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter trying smooth floored dens, and floors strewn with straw, chips,\r\nashes and sawdust; I feel safe in recommending sawdust, as its great\r\nabsorbent power helps to keep clean dens. It should cover the floor to a\r\ndepth of two inches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            7.—Food Troughs.\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not use wooden troughs; they are unsanitary. Pie dishes either tin or\r\nware, will do if the sides do not flare. If they do the skunk usually\r\nspills the milk or any liquid in the dish, by standing on the sides with\r\nits paws.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             8.—Food House.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe food and tool-house should be in the pen for convenience. There\r\nshould be mice and rat-proof vessels to keep the oatmeal and dry\r\nbiscuit, cheese, and meat in. It should be equipped with a large boiler\r\nfor boiling oatmeal and meat in. The meat may also be smoked as this\r\nwill preserve it, and is greatly preferred by the animals. The meat may\r\nbe hung out of reach of the rats in sacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              9.—Feeding.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkunks like most animals are omnivorous. A continuous unbroken diet of\r\nmeat would eventually wipe out the stock; as would a diet solely\r\nvegetable. Moderate varied feeding is essential. Adult skunks are fed\r\nonce a day, they themselves prefer it after dark. Staple articles of\r\nfood are beef, rabbit, cow liver, chicken giblets, oatmeal, and other\r\nporridge, cooked potatoes and milk; anything a dog will eat with fruit\r\nand insects added. Be sure the meat is clear of infection.\r\n\r\nAnother staple article of food is a bread made of bran and shorts. Mix\r\nwith three quarts of sour milk, enough flour to make a stiff dough. Roll\r\ndough out until it is an inch thick and bake for an hour like bread in a\r\nhot oven.\r\n\r\nThis is much relished by all fur-bearing animals, and is still more\r\nacceptable if flavored with a few spoonfuls of black molasses.\r\n\r\nMilk must be given sparingly unless it agrees with the stock. Once a\r\nweek is enough, more than that is liable to induce scouring and other\r\ndisorders. Half a dog biscuit, and a few scraps of meat are enough for a\r\nskunk’s daily allowance. Of course some should have more than others\r\naccording to their needs.\r\n\r\nA brood-mother growing or suckling her young should have as much as she\r\ncan eat twice a day, morning and evening.\r\n\r\nWhen winter comes, skunks retire to their dens and eat nothing for\r\nweeks. In March the feeding is resumed and in April the brood mothers\r\nare extra fed with a preponderance of meat, much of it raw. It costs\r\nfrom twenty-five cents to a dollar to feed a skunk from June first to\r\nDecember first. Meat and fresh water are necessary at all times for\r\nbrood-mothers, for if this is neglected they will devour the young as\r\nsoon as born.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           10.—Water Troughs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkunks drink much, and often. They must have plenty of fresh water at\r\nall times; especially when the young are expected. The vessel that the\r\nwater at all times is kept in should be washed every day. In winter the\r\nskunks lap up snow instead of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           11.—Examining Box.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo cautious man would undertake to examine a wild skunk as he would a\r\ndog or rabbit. Yet it is important to know sex and condition of each new\r\nskunk as it arrives. This may be easily and quickly done by means of an\r\nexamining box. This is a small box 10″ by 8″ by 6″ covered with a\r\nchicken wire of about one inch mesh on the top. There should be a six\r\ninch entrance at one end of the box.\r\n\r\nOn the solid wood bottom is a handle which is of course the top, when\r\nthe box is turned wire side down.\r\n\r\nChase the skunk in the entrance slowly and then lift the box up by the\r\nhandle and look under without fear. As soon as the operation is over the\r\nskunk will seek his proper den.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             12.—Diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe keeper should watch the animal’s dung, if too fluid or too soft, too\r\ncopious or too little, there is something wrong. Their appetite, and the\r\ndung are the great tests. If these are right there is little chance of\r\nanything being wrong.\r\n\r\nGreed—Some cases often abound among skunks such as over-eating; by\r\ngetting all they can from the other skunks, after eating their own food.\r\nSuch freaks should be isolated and marketed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nCannibalism—Sometimes when enclosures are small the mothers devour the\r\nyoung as soon as born. This is sometimes the result of quarreling.\r\nAlways build the enclosures large enough so the skunks have plenty of\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMurder—Murder must be considered a disease. Some individuals are\r\nincapable of it while others are very prone to it. The last mentioned\r\nsoon make themselves known. They should be marketed as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nDistemper—This may be detected by the animal’s eyes and nose running.\r\nThe animal should be sent at once to the hospital, and treated by\r\nwashing the nose and eyes with a solution of boric acid and water.\r\n\r\nMange—Mange is considered a serious disease, and is caused by fleas\r\nwhich induce the animal to scratch. The fur gets thin and the body is\r\ncovered with scabs. This may be cured by applying a good flea powder and\r\na dip.\r\n\r\nWorms—Worms may be eliminated by feeding the skunks in a dish of clear,\r\nsharp, sand.\r\n\r\nOther Foes—While the armed skunk travels about without fear of man or\r\nbeast, it must be remembered that the disarmed young skunks may be\r\nkilled by dogs, or taken by horned owls or any other large bird.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               13.—Rats.\r\n\r\n\r\nRats are a great nuisance about a fur ranch. They often dig holes and\r\nteach the young skunks the way to escape. They also kill the young, and\r\nare quick enough to keep out of the way of the mother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           14.—Disinfectants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose I use are—Chloride of lime, peroxide of hydrogen, and lysol, 2%.\r\n\r\nTo disinfect a den, put it in a large tub and soak it in “sheep dip”.\r\n\r\nTo disinfect a corner, sprinkle with chloride of lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             15.—Hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hospital is a series of cages, quite removed from the other, with\r\nthe earth and grass for a floor, and good opportunities for a “sun\r\nbath”. Sick animals should be put in the hospital as soon as noted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                  16.—Breeding and Winter Management.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stock should be mated about November or December. Put one male to\r\nfour or five females. It is well to watch them for a few days to make\r\nsure the group is harmonious. Often it happens that one female will\r\nquarrel with the others.\r\n\r\nShe should be removed and tried somewhere else. If one is seen outside\r\nthe den constantly, this is the cause.\r\n\r\nPut plenty of straw in the den and they will make themselves comfortable\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter they eat nothing. Some breeders deem it wise to feed a\r\nlight meal a week.\r\n\r\nMating time is from the middle of March, starting with February. Males\r\nmust not meet at this time for they will fight, until one or the other\r\nis killed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          17.—Barren Females.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree or four days after mating season has set in, remove the male and\r\ntry some other male in, or for a few days. As the males are decided in\r\ntheir likes and dislikes. Neglect of this precaution will result in a\r\nlarge proportion of barren females.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         18.—Breeding Mothers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy April first every female should be given a separate den, and well fed\r\nand cared for.\r\n\r\nThis is the most important time of all, success or failure depends on\r\nthe management of the mother at this time. Toward the end of the month\r\nshe should be given raw meat and plenty of water. This diet should be\r\ngiven until mid-May, as this allays the meat craving which causes the\r\nmother to devour the new-born young.\r\n\r\nI will repeat again the watchwords of success—\r\n\r\nProper sanitation, seclusion, and quiet, an abundance of raw meat and\r\nfresh water.\r\n\r\nThe period of gestation is nine weeks; the young are born in mid-May.\r\n\r\nThe young females have from four to six young the first litter and the\r\nolder females have from eight to sixteen to one litter.\r\n\r\nNever put two females with young, in the same house for they will fight\r\nand steal one and anothers’ young.\r\n\r\nOne family in one house is a good old rule to observe.\r\n\r\nWhen one month old they are able to walk around and drink milk. I would\r\nadvise disarming and weaning at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               19.—Young.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young grow very fast and soon become as tame as kittens, some show\r\ntheir amazing temper at this age, from the beginning.\r\n\r\nAt thirty days they walk alone and drink milk. At sixty days they will\r\nweigh on the average of six lbs. each, and appear to be half grown. At\r\nsix months they are full-grown, and weigh from four to six lbs.\r\n\r\nAt this age they are ready to be marketed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              20.—Escapes.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well to be prepared for escapes. A properly constructed fence will\r\nprevent this.\r\n\r\nTwo contrivances should be in stock—net and traps.\r\n\r\nNet—This is an ordinary dip net to put over them.\r\n\r\nTraps—These are box traps, or “catch-alives”. They are easily\r\nconstructed, and one half dozen will be found convenient for many\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             21.—Disarming.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo prevent a shot from this deadly battery of the skunk they are\r\ndisarmed while very young. When animals are young the operation is a\r\nsimple one; but when performed when they are grown not more than one out\r\nof three survives the operation.\r\n\r\nWhen ready for disarming, spread a burlap or gunnysack across your lap\r\nand order the assistant to bring the skunk. He must be careful to hold\r\nit by the tail, with it near the ground. The sack is then rolled around\r\nthe animal; rear exposed.\r\n\r\nThe assistant holds the animal firmly and double muffles the eyes, so it\r\ncannot possibly see. A skunk seldom shoots unless it sees an enemy.\r\n\r\nThe proper instruments consist of a scalpel, clamping forceps,\r\nextracting forceps, hook and goggles.\r\n\r\nThe scent sacks are located one on each side of the vent off one fourth\r\ninch from the vent.\r\n\r\nTo disarm—First make an incision three eighths of an inch long and one\r\nhalf an inch from the vent.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the incision is made, cut deeper until the scent sac appears,\r\nwhich is about the size of a bean in young skunks and about the size of\r\na marble in mature ones.\r\n\r\nWith the blunt forceps, force the adhering muscles down off the sac, and\r\ncut the sac off one fourth inch from the vent.\r\n\r\nIf the operation is done according to instructions, there will be no\r\nloss whatever.\r\n\r\nAnimals do not require disarming unless they are going to be shipped. If\r\nskunks are raised solely for fur, it is just as well to leave them\r\narmed.\r\n\r\nExpress companies refuse to ship them unless scent sacks are removed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         22.—How to Ship Skunk.\r\n\r\n\r\nSecure them when ready for market, by using a box-trap. Never try to\r\nhandle them.\r\n\r\nTo ship them, put each in a small soap-box lined with tin.\r\n\r\nCut a hole three inches square in the side and cover it with wire of one\r\ninch mesh.\r\n\r\nFasten a tin in one corner of the box three inches from the bottom for\r\nwater. Above this make a hole to pour water through.\r\n\r\nMark it “water here”. Make a lid in the box for convenience in feeding.\r\n\r\nOne pound of dog biscuits, or bread, and a few scraps of meat will amply\r\nsupply a skunk on the road. Label the bag “Seven days food”.\r\n\r\nDo not fear to lift the lid and look in, for a skunk must be greatly\r\nalarmed and provoked before discharging musk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the material in this book is thoroughly understood and mastered, and\r\nthe reader is the proud possessor of two “star-black” skunks in a plot,\r\nfenced secure against escape, in five years he can reap large dividends.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: Decorative tree in pot.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n--Silently corrected a few palpable typos.\r\n\r\n--Retained the original (expired) copyright notice from the printed\r\n  copy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Practical Skunk Raising, by William Edwin Pratt",
