Whatever the reason, it is beyond\r\ndispute that the United States is _par excellence_ a land of beautiful\r\nvillages. North, south, east, and west, there are plenty of hideous\r\nconglomerations of poor-looking houses, with an absence of every element\r\nof beauty; but there are thousands of other villages scattered all over\r\nthe land, which are full of the evidences of good taste in their\r\nregulation and in their management.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, these more attractive features are very much modified by the\r\npresence of badly-kept private places or neglected public buildings, and\r\nby a general air of untidiness. Still, the foundation of attractiveness\r\nis there; and nothing is needed beyond a well-organized and well-guided\r\ncontrol of public sentiment, to remove or to hide the more objectionable\r\nfeatures, and to permit such beauty as the village may possess to\r\nmanifest itself.\r\n\r\nThe real elements of beauty in a village are not fine houses, costly\r\nfences, paved roadways, geometrical lines, mathematical grading, nor any\r\nobviously costly improvements. They are, rather, cosiness, neatness,\r\nsimplicity, and that homely air that grows from these and from the\r\npresence of a home-loving people.\r\n\r\nTo state the case tersely, the shiftless village is a hideous village,\r\nwhile the charm which we often realize without analyzing it comes of\r\naffectionate care and attention.\r\n\r\nThere are villages in New England, in Western New York, and all over the\r\nWest, even to the far side of Arkansas, which impress the visitor at\r\nonce as being homelike and full of sociability and kindliness; which\r\ndelight him, and lead him almost to wish that his own lot had been cast\r\nwithin their shades. These are chiefly villages where the evidences of\r\npublic and private care predominate, or are at least conspicuous. A\r\ncritical examination would, in almost every case, develop very serious\r\nevidence of neglect, unwholesomeness, and bad neighborhood.\r\n\r\nWithin a few years, beginning, I believe, in Massachusetts, the more\r\nthoughtful of those whose affections are centred in their village homes\r\nhave united in organized efforts to make their villages more tidy, to\r\ninterest all classes of society in attention to those little details the\r\nneglect of which is fatal, and to make the village, what it certainly\r\nshould be, an expression of the interest of its people in their homes\r\nand in the surroundings of their daily life.\r\n\r\nThe first of these associations of which I have any knowledge (though,\r\nas such work is unobtrusive, there may have been many before it) was the\r\n\"Laurel Hill Association\" of Stockbridge, Mass. It takes its name from a\r\nwooded knoll in the centre of the village, which had been dedicated to\r\npublic use. The first object of the association was to convert this\r\nknoll into a village park. Then they took in hand the village\r\nburial-ground, which was put in proper condition and suitably surrounded\r\nwith hedge and railing. Then the broad village street was properly\r\ngraded and drained, and agreeable walks were made at its sides.\r\nIncidentally to this, the people living along both sides of the streets\r\nwere encouraged to do what they could to give it an appropriate setting\r\nby putting their own premises into tasteful condition and maintaining\r\nthem so. The organization worked well, and accomplished good results.\r\nThe Rev. N. P. Eggleston, formerly of Stockbridge, in a paper on village\r\nimprovements written for the \"New York Tribune,\" thus describes the\r\ncollateral work and influences of the Laurel Hill Association:--\r\n\r\n     \"Next followed the planting of trees by the roadside wherever trees\r\n     were lacking. The children, sometimes disposed in their\r\n     thoughtlessness to treat young trees too rudely, were brought in as\r\n     helpers of the association, while at the same time put under a\r\n     beneficial culture for themselves. Any boy who would undertake to\r\n     watch and care for a particular tree for two years was rewarded by\r\n     having the tree called by his name. Other children were paid for\r\n     all the loose papers and other unsightly things which they would\r\n     pick up and remove from the street.\r\n\r\n     \"Gradually the work of the association extended. It soon took in\r\n     hand the streets connected with the main street. Year by year it\r\n     pushed out walks from the centre of the village toward its outer\r\n     borders; year by year it extended its line of trees in the same\r\n     manner; and year by year there has been a marked improvement in the\r\n     aspect of the village. Little by little, and in many nameless ways,\r\n     the houses and barns, the dooryards and farms, have come to wear a\r\n     look of neatness and intelligent, tasteful care, that makes the\r\n     Stockbridge of to-day quite a different place from the Stockbridge\r\n     of twenty years ago. Travellers passing through it are apt to speak\r\n     of it with admiration as a finished place, and, compared with most\r\n     even of our New England villages, it has such a look; but the\r\n     Laurel Hill Association does not consider its home finished, nor\r\n     its own work completed. Still the work goes on. Committees are even\r\n     now conning plans for further improvements. By itself, or by\r\n     suggestions and stimulations offered to others, the association is\r\n     aiming at the culture of the village people through other agencies\r\n     than those of outward and physical adornment. It fosters libraries,\r\n     reading-rooms, and other places of resort where innocent and\r\n     healthful games, music and conversation will tend to promote the\r\n     social feeling, and lessen vice by removing some of its causes.\"\r\n\r\nNo one can drive through this beautiful old place without realizing the\r\neffect of some influence different from that which has usually been at\r\nwork in country towns. One feels that it is a village of homes; that the\r\npeople who live in it love it, and that it has no public or private\r\ninterest so insignificant as to be neglected.\r\n\r\nI have cited this instance somewhat at length, because it was the first,\r\nas it is the most complete, that has come to my notice. In other places,\r\nmore serious work of improvement has been undertaken in the direction of\r\nsewerage, gas-lighting, &c. In fact, the present writing was suggested\r\nby frequent requests for information and advice on the more practical\r\nparts of the subject.\r\n\r\nAt the outset it is to be said that the organization and control of the\r\nvillage society is especially woman's work. It requires the sort of\r\nsystematized attention to detail, especially in the constantly-recurring\r\nduty of \"cleaning up,\" that grows more naturally out of the habit of\r\ngood housekeeping than out of any occupation to which men are\r\naccustomed. Then, too, it calls for a degree of leisure which women are\r\nthe most apt to have, and it will especially engage their interest as\r\nbeing a real addition to the field of their ordinary routine of life.\r\nThe sort of enthusiasm which has led to marked success in the Dorcas\r\nSociety and other organized action outside of the household, for which\r\nAmerican country women are noted, will find here a new and engaging\r\nobject. This, however, is only a suggestion by the way, and one which\r\nmay or may not be appropriate under varying circumstances.\r\n\r\nIf we assume, which is not altogether true, that the main purpose of\r\nvillage improvement is to improve the _appearance_ of the village, we\r\nmust still understand that the direct object of the society should not\r\nbe alone nor chiefly in the direction of appearance.\r\n\r\nWhat it is especially desirable that a village should appear to be is: a\r\nwholesome, cleanly, tidy, simple, modest collection of country homes,\r\nwith all of its parts and appliances adapted to the pleasantest and most\r\nsatisfactory living of its people. All improvements should therefore\r\nhave this fundamental tendency, and every element of adornment, and\r\nevery evidence of careful attention, should be only an outgrowth of the\r\neffort to obtain the best practical results. Costly park railing where\r\nno railing is needed, width of roadway greater than the needs of the\r\ncommunity require, formal geometric lines and surfaces where more\r\nnatural slopes and curves would be practically better, elaborate\r\nfountains or statuary out of keeping with the general character of the\r\nvillage, (the gift of a public-spirited, ambitious, and pretentious\r\nfellow-townsman,) and isolated examples, as in a church or schoolhouse,\r\nof a style of architecture which would be more appropriate for a\r\ncity,--all these are obtrusive and objectionable, and are consequently\r\nin bad taste. In so far as these or any other elements of improvement\r\nare unsuited to the conditions in which they are placed, they are\r\nundesirable; and it would be well for those having the interest of the\r\nvillage in charge, to adopt an early resolution to accept no gifts, and\r\nto allow no work of construction or embellishment, which is not, first\r\nof all, appropriate to the modest character of a well-regulated country\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\nIf every public building is sufficient for its uses and suggests no\r\nundue outlay for show alone; if the roads and walks are such as the uses\r\nof the people require; if the fountain suggests a tasteful ornament and\r\ncentre of freshness and coolness, rather than a monument of some\r\ncitizens liberality and ambition; if the village green or park is a\r\nproper pleasure-ground for old and young; and, in short, if every thing\r\nthat is done and every dollar that is expended has for its object only\r\nthe improvement of the conditions of living,--then there will be needed\r\nonly the element of careful keeping to maintain always the best sort of\r\nbeauty that is possible under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nNo satisfactory result can be attained without organization. The work\r\nwill necessarily require much money and more time in order to avoid an\r\nundue tax upon individuals. It is desirable, too, that, so far as\r\npossible, every member of the community should be interested in the\r\nwork, and should contribute in labor or in money according to his means.\r\nThis general interest can be secured much better through the influence\r\nof an organization in which all are interested, than by any individual\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nThe association should become the distributor, not only of the moneys\r\naccruing from membership fees, &c., but of contributions made by\r\ncitizens, or subscriptions raised by combined effort for general or\r\nspecific works of improvement. It should be, in fact, not only the\r\ninciter of public spirit, but the director of public effort.\r\n\r\nThe precise form of constitution for such an association must\r\nnecessarily depend more or less on circumstances; and I sketch only as a\r\nbasis for discussion, the following form suggested by the regulations\r\ngoverning the Laurel Hill Association of Stockbridge:--\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE I.\r\n\r\n     This Association shall be called \"The Village Improvement\r\n     Association of ----.\"\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE II.\r\n\r\n     The object of this Association shall be to improve and ornament the\r\n     streets and public grounds of the village by planting and\r\n     cultivating trees, establishing and maintaining walks, grading and\r\n     draining roadways, establishing and protecting good grass plats and\r\n     borders in the streets and public squares, securing a proper public\r\n     supply of water, establishing and maintaining such sewerage as\r\n     shall be needed for the best sanitary condition of the village,\r\n     providing public fountains and drinking-troughs, breaking out paths\r\n     through the snow, lighting the streets, encouraging the formation\r\n     of a library and reading-room, and generally doing whatever may\r\n     tend to the improvement of the village as a place of residence.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE III.\r\n\r\n     The officers of this Association shall be a President, two\r\n     Vice-Presidents, a Secretary, and a Treasurer, who shall constitute\r\n     the Executive Committee. These officers shall be elected at the\r\n     annual meeting, and shall hold their offices until their successors\r\n     shall have been elected.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE IV.\r\n\r\n     It shall be the duty of the President, and in his absence of the\r\n     senior Vice-President, to preside at all meetings of the\r\n     Association, and to carry out all orders of the Executive\r\n     Committee.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE V.\r\n\r\n     It shall be the duty of the Secretary to keep a correct and careful\r\n     record of all proceedings of the Association, and of the Executive\r\n     Committee, in a book suitable for their preservation; to give\r\n     notice of all meetings of the Association and of the Executive\r\n     Committee; to make all publications, and to give all public and\r\n     private notices ordered by the Executive Committee, and to attend\r\n     to all the correspondence of the Association.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE VI.\r\n\r\n     It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to keep the funds of the\r\n     Association, and to make such disbursements as may be ordered by\r\n     the Executive Committee.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE VII.\r\n\r\n     It shall be the duty of the Executive Committee to manage all the\r\n     affairs of the Association, to employ all laborers, to make all\r\n     contracts, to expend all moneys, and generally to direct and\r\n     superintend all improvements which in their discretion, and with\r\n     the means at their command, will best serve the public interest.\r\n     The Executive Committee shall hold a meeting at least once in each\r\n     month, and as much oftener as they may deem expedient.\r\n\r\n     The Executive Committee shall have power to institute premiums to\r\n     be awarded for planting and protecting ornamental trees, and for\r\n     doing such other acts as may seem to them worthy of such\r\n     encouragement. They shall also encourage frequent public meetings\r\n     of the Association and of citizens generally, both with a view to\r\n     maintain an interest in their work, and for the general\r\n     encouragement of the habit of meeting for discussion and amusement.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE VIII.\r\n\r\n     Three members of the Executive Committee present at any meeting\r\n     shall constitute a quorum for transacting business; and the vote of\r\n     a majority of those present shall be binding on the Association.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE IX.\r\n\r\n     No debt shall be contracted by the Executive Committee beyond the\r\n     amount of available funds within their control to pay it; and no\r\n     member of this Association shall be liable for any debt of the\r\n     Association beyond the amount of his or her subscription.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE X.\r\n\r\n     Every person over fourteen years of age who shall plant and\r\n     protect a tree under the direction of the Executive Committee, or\r\n     who shall pay the sum of one dollar annually, and shall obligate\r\n     him or herself to pay the same for three years, shall be a member\r\n     of this Association; and every child under fourteen years of age,\r\n     who shall pay or shall become obligated to pay as before the sum of\r\n     twenty-five cents annually for three years, shall be a member of\r\n     this Association.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XI.\r\n\r\n     The payment of ten dollars annually for three years, or of\r\n     twenty-five dollars in one sum, shall constitute a person a member\r\n     of this Association for life.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XII.\r\n\r\n     The autograph signatures of all members of the Association shall be\r\n     preserved in a book suitable for that purpose.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XIII.\r\n\r\n     An annual meeting of the Association shall be held at such place as\r\n     the Executive Committee may direct, on the fourth Wednesday of\r\n     August, at two o'clock, P.M. Notice of such meeting shall be posted\r\n     on each of the churches and at the post-office at least seven days\r\n     prior to the time of holding said meetings, and a written notice\r\n     shall be sent to all non-resident members. Other meetings of the\r\n     Association may be called by the Executive Committee on seven days'\r\n     notice as above prescribed.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XIV.\r\n\r\n     At the annual meeting, the Executive Committee shall report the\r\n     amount of money received during the year, and the source from which\r\n     it has been received; the amount of money expended during the year,\r\n     and the objects for which it has been expended; the number of trees\r\n     planted at the cost of the Association; the number planted by\r\n     individuals, with the location, the kind of tree, and the name of\r\n     the planter; and generally all of the acts of the Committee. This\r\n     report shall be entered on the record of the Association.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XV.\r\n\r\n     Any person who shall plant a tree under the direction of the\r\n     Executive Committee, and shall protect it for five years, shall be\r\n     entitled to have such tree known forever by his or her name.\r\n\r\n     ARTICLE XVI.\r\n\r\n     This Constitution may be amended by the Executive Committee with\r\n     the approval of the majority of the members present at any annual\r\n     meeting of the Association, or at any special meeting, the notice\r\n     of which shall have been accompanied by a copy of the proposed\r\n     amendment, with the statement that the amendment is to be voted on\r\n     at such meeting.\r\n\r\nI have provided, in the above draft of a constitution, for an executive\r\ncommittee of only five members; for the reason that, while it will be\r\ncomparatively easy to secure the services of this number, the duties and\r\nresponsibilities of a larger committee would be so distributed that\r\nthere would be too often occasion for the application of the old adage:\r\n\"What is everybody's business is nobody's business.\" The Laurel Hill\r\nAssociation has an executive committee of fifteen, in addition to seven\r\nofficers. This large committee (twenty-two) serves to secure the\r\ninterest of a larger number of citizens; but the same thing may be as\r\nwell accomplished by inviting the co-operation of citizens in the work\r\nof sub-committees, the chairman of each of which would be a member of\r\nthe regular executive committee. In Easthampton, Mass., there is a board\r\nof fourteen directors, and there are committees on sanitary matters, on\r\nsetting out trees, on sidewalks and hitching-posts, &c. It would be\r\nprudent to restrict the number of members of these sub-committees to\r\nthree; one from the executive committee and two from outside.\r\n\r\nBesides special executive work, a vast deal has been done wherever\r\nimprovement societies have been organized, in the way of stimulating\r\ncitizens to adorn their private grounds, or at least to keep their\r\ngrounds and fences in good order, removing weeds and rubbish from the\r\nsidewalk, keeping the grass well trimmed and free from litter and\r\nleaves. What most detracts from the good appearance of any village is\r\nthe slovenly look which comes from badly hung gates, crooked fences,\r\nabsent pickets, and general shiftlessness about private places; and it\r\nis by encouraging citizens to take a pride in attention to these minor\r\ndetails, that the association will do its best work. This result may be\r\naccomplished almost entirely without the expenditure of money. It is in\r\nattention to little things and in securing the co-operation of private\r\nowners,--a co-operation which will call for an inappreciable amount of\r\nlabor,--that the most telling work of the officers of the society is to\r\nbe done.\r\n\r\nSo far as these details are concerned, it is hardly necessary in a paper\r\nof this sort to do more than to call attention to them. They are within\r\nthe capacity of every citizen, and they will naturally suggest\r\nthemselves to any person who would be likely to undertake the direction\r\nof an improvement association. There are other and really more important\r\nobjects looking to a certain amount of landscape gardening and\r\nengineering, on which specific instruction may be desired, and often in\r\ncases where it will be impracticable to employ professional assistance.\r\nThese are as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. The construction of sidewalks.\r\n\r\n2. The construction and care of roadways.\r\n\r\n3. The supply of water, and the construction of drinking-troughs.\r\n\r\n4. The laying-out and adornment of public squares and other open spaces.\r\n\r\n5. The establishment of a system of sewerage or sanitary drainage,\r\nincluding the removal of excessive soil moisture.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIDEWALKS.\r\n\r\nNo one thing has more to do with the comfort of those living in country\r\nvillages than sidewalks which are good at all seasons of the year. Those\r\nfortunate villages which are built on a gravelly soil, with a perfect\r\nnatural drainage, need little more in this direction than such a\r\nconformation of the surface as will prevent water from standing on the\r\nfootway when the ground is frozen. At all other times it sinks naturally\r\naway into the earth. It is much more often the case that the character\r\nof the soil or subsoil prevents a settling away of water, or that\r\nsubterranean oozing from higher ground keeps the earth throughout the\r\nspring and autumn, and after heavy rains in summer, damp, and often\r\nsloppy. Wherever the ground is of such a character as to prevent the\r\nrapid sinking to a considerable depth of all excessive moisture, there\r\nis sure to be a disagreeable condition of the footway whenever the lower\r\nsoil is locked with frost, and the surface is thawed. Even with the best\r\ndrainage, natural or artificial, this condition will exist for a short\r\ntime while frost is coming out of the ground; but with good drainage it\r\nis of so temporary a character as hardly to justify any expensive\r\nfinishing of the surface, except perhaps in the case of the most\r\nfrequented walks.\r\n\r\nTo overcome occasional sloppiness where the difficulty is not\r\ndeep-seated, there is no cheaper nor better device than to dress the\r\nsurface with coal-ashes. Indeed, if these are used to a sufficient\r\nthickness, they are practically as good as concrete or the best gravel.\r\nWhen first applied, they are dusty and unpleasant; but the first wetting\r\nlays the dust, and they soon settle to a firm consistency, and make a\r\nvery pleasant walk, with the great advantage of being entirely barren,\r\nand preventing the growth of weeds and grass. If the ashes of a village\r\nare collected and screened, the cinders being used at the bottom, and\r\nthe surface being smoothly dressed with the finer material, they will\r\nmake as satisfactory walks, even where the use is considerable, as any\r\nother material. The color is unobtrusive, and the surface soon becomes\r\nhard enough to bear sweeping. Those who are more ambitious for effect\r\nmay prefer a walk made of tar-and-gravel concrete; and this, if well\r\nmade, is good, durable, and satisfactory. So far as the improvement\r\nassociation is concerned, it can find many ways for expending the\r\ndifference of cost between ashes and concrete, which will accomplish a\r\nmuch more telling result.\r\n\r\nIf gravel can be obtained without too much expense, it may be used with\r\nexcellent results to a depth of from one to three inches, according to\r\nthe porosity of the subsoil,--more being needed where the ground is\r\ninclined to become soft. In using gravel it is best either to screen it,\r\nusing the coarser parts below and the finer parts at the surface, or,\r\nafter applying it, to add a thin layer of earth, barely sufficient to\r\nfill its spaces,--to \"bind\" it so as to give it a firm and solid\r\nconsistency. Loose and rattling gravel makes a handsome walk to look at,\r\nbut an unpleasant one to walk upon. Nothing is more agreeable than\r\nwell-trodden, dry, root-bound earth, as where grass has been worn away\r\nby frequent use; but this becomes at once objectionable on being\r\nsaturated with rain or moistened by melting frost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.]\r\n\r\nIt is a common impression, that all thoroughly good foot-paths must be\r\ndug out to a considerable depth, filled with loose stones, and dressed\r\nat the top with some good finishing material; but this is not necessary\r\neven for the best work. The great point is to secure a thorough draining\r\nof the sub-stratum, so that there shall be no rising of ooze-water from\r\nbelow, and so that the ground shall be free from such saturation as to\r\ncause heaving during frost. This condition may be secured by a suitable\r\ndraining of the ground immediately under the walk, and by the use of a\r\nwell-compacted and tightly-bound surface covering of such form as to\r\nshed or turn away rain-water. Figure 1 (p. 31) shows the cross section\r\nof a foot-path six feet wide on slightly sloping ground, where we have\r\nto apprehend an oozing of subsoil water from the land at the highest\r\nside. The centre of the walk is slightly crowning,--say one inch higher\r\nthan the sides,--so that rain falling upon it will flow readily toward\r\nthe grass-border at either side. To prevent the ponding of water at the\r\nsides when the ground is frozen, the surface of the walk at its edges\r\nshould be well above the level of the adjoining ground; but it may be\r\nnecessary under some circumstances to furnish, here and there, a channel\r\nor surface-gutter across the walk, to allow the accumulation at the\r\nhigher side to escape. Rarely will deep gutters at the sides be\r\nnecessary or desirable. If the walk is laid at a sufficient height to\r\nturn water on to the adjoining ground instead of receiving water from\r\nthis, it will be easy to keep it dry. We will assume that the path in\r\nquestion is to be made over a tenacious clay soil, with a considerable\r\noozing from the hillside,--the most unfavorable condition that can be\r\nfound, especially in cold climates. The first thing to be secured is the\r\ncutting-off of the subsoil water from the hill. This may be done by\r\ndigging a trench as narrow as possible,--six inches will be better than\r\nmore, as requiring less filling material,--to a depth of three feet. In\r\nthe bottom of this drain lay a common land-tile drain, with collars at\r\nthe joints if these can be procured, and, if not, with a bit of paper\r\nlaid over the joints to prevent the entrance of loose material, and to\r\nhold the pipes in place during construction. The ditch should then be\r\nfilled with cinders, gravel, or coarse sand. If stones are to be used,\r\nthey should be broken to a small size,--not more than one inch in\r\ndiameter,--and the loose bits should be mixed with them in the filling.\r\nVery small interstices will be sufficient to allow water to pass freely\r\nthrough, while if large stones are used, with large interstices, there\r\nwill be danger of a washing-in of earth sufficient in time to obstruct\r\nboth the stonework and the tile. The smaller the tile, so long as it is\r\nsufficient for its purpose, the better; for lengths of five hundred feet\r\nor less, an interior diameter of an inch and a quarter will be\r\nsufficient; from this to one thousand feet, use an inch and a half bore.\r\nIf possible, before exceeding this length, secure an outlet for the\r\nwater in the roadside gutter or some other channel of exit. The\r\ntile-drain, at a depth of three feet, will remove all subsoil water from\r\nunder the walk, and all that may be delivered into the loosely filled\r\ntrench at its side. The loose filling of the trench should not be\r\ncarried nearer than within six inches of the surface of the ground, and\r\nshould be covered with fine and well-packed earth to prevent the\r\nentrance of _surface_-water which would soon carry in silt enough to\r\nstop its action. Whatever covering is adopted for the walk itself, it\r\nmust be of such a character as to prevent any thing like a free\r\nadmission of surface-water. Concrete will do this perfectly; and either\r\nashes, or gravel dressed at the top with ashes, if well raked and rolled\r\nat the outset to a smooth surface, will soon become so bound together as\r\nto shed pretty nearly all rain falling upon it. The difference in cost\r\nbetween a walk made in this way, and one dug out for its whole width to\r\na depth of two feet, and filled first with stone and then with gravel\r\nand a suitable surface dressing, will be very important; and it is safe\r\nto say that the cheaper will be at least as good and durable as the more\r\nexpensive method. In all construction of sidewalks, whether public or\r\nprivate, regard must be had to the surface conformation, and some device\r\nmust be adopted for preventing the flow of water upon the walk from the\r\nadjoining ground, and for the easy delivery of storm-water falling upon\r\nthe walk itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nROADWAYS.\r\n\r\nThe great expense of Macadamizing or Telfordizing puts these systems\r\nalmost out of the reach of small communities. Wherever the original\r\nexpense can be borne, the subsequent cost of maintenance will be so\r\nslight, and the result generally will be so satisfactory, as to make it\r\nalways a good investment. The circumstances under which these costly\r\nforms of construction may be adopted will be greatly extended if we can\r\novercome the prevalent American prejudice in favor of _wide_ roadways.\r\nAgainst wide _streets_ there is, as a rule, no objection, though\r\nexceptional narrow and well-shaded lanes have a rural charm that will\r\nalways commend them to persons of taste. A wide street, that is, broad\r\nspaces between fences, by no means implies a broad roadway. All we need\r\nin the principal thoroughfare of a busy village is such a width as will\r\nallow of the easy passing of vehicles in the middle of the road, and the\r\nstanding of one vehicle at rest at each side. This will be accomplished,\r\neven in the business street of a village, by a width of roadway of\r\nthirty feet. Under most other circumstances twenty feet of roadway will\r\nbe ample. This will allow of the moving of three vehicles side by side,\r\nand will give a leeway of six feet between two vehicles passing each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nOn both sides of this roadway, except for the necessary sidewalks, the\r\nwhole space to the fences should be in well-kept grass, which is the\r\ncheapest to secure, the most economical to maintain, and the most\r\nagreeable to see, of all ground covering. It is not unusual in country\r\ntowns to find a width of from sixty to eighty feet devoted to a muddy,\r\ndusty, and ill-kept roadway. From one-half to two-thirds of this width\r\nis waste space, which must either remain an eyesore, or entail an undue\r\ncost for maintenance. When both sides of the street are occupied by\r\nplaces of business, it may be necessary to provide for some occasional\r\ndriving close to the buildings for the delivery of merchandise; but this\r\noccasion will rarely be so regular as to cause any serious damage to\r\ngrass. If the line of hitching-posts is placed within fifteen feet of\r\nthe centre of the roadway on each side, it will be seldom that any one\r\nwill drive over the bordering grass, especially if there is, as there\r\ngenerally should be, a well-defined gutter or well-kept grass with a\r\ncurbstone border at each side.\r\n\r\nIn considering the width to be given to roadways, it should be\r\nunderstood that every form of road is more or less costly to make and to\r\nkeep in order, and that the cost of both items is in direct proportion\r\nto the width. If to the cost of making and grading an ordinary roadway\r\nsixty feet wide, we add the capital sum whose interest would be\r\nnecessary to keep this width in good repair, we shall have an amount\r\nthat would go far toward the construction and maintenance of a road of\r\nthe very best quality only thirty feet wide. Furthermore, while it is\r\nimpossible to estimate such items exactly, and while the amount thus\r\nsaved cannot be controlled for the road-making account, the saving in\r\nthe wear and tear of vehicles, and in the team force needed to move\r\nheavy loads, constitutes an important argument in favor of the best\r\nconstruction. The amount thus saved in the short streets of the village,\r\nwhere the principal traffic is over rough country roads, would not be\r\nvery great, but it would enable the road authorities of the township to\r\nrealize the advantage of first-rate roads and the degree to which the\r\nnarrowing of the roadway cheapens construction. As a result, there would\r\nsoon be an extension of the improvement over the more important highways\r\ninto the country; where a well-metalled width of twelve feet would\r\naccommodate nearly the whole traffic, and where the proper application\r\nof a cheap system of under-drainage would make well-metalled roads\r\nextremely cheap to maintain.\r\n\r\nIn the island of Jersey, there are many excellent roads only six feet\r\nwide. These are provided with frequent little bays or turn-outs to allow\r\nteams to pass each other. Although such extremely narrow roads are not\r\nto be recommended, the difference in comfort and economy of teampower\r\nbetween these and the average American dirt road is enormously in their\r\nfavor. The widest roads in Jersey, leading from a busy town of thirty\r\nthousand inhabitants into a thickly settled farming region where\r\nbusiness and pleasure travel is very active, and where \"excursion cars\"\r\ncarrying thirty or forty persons are constantly passing, are only\r\ntwenty-four feet wide; often only of this width between the hedge-rows,\r\nthe road itself being an excellent footpath for its whole width. Nowhere\r\nelse in the world is the rural charm more perfectly developed than in\r\nJersey, and no element of its great beauty is so conspicuous and so\r\nconstantly satisfactory as its narrow and embowered lanes and roadways.\r\n\r\nThis, however, by the way, and only as a suggestion, for the sake of\r\nvariety. As a rule, we may at least accept much less width than is now\r\nusual for our country and village roads. Wherever it is intended to\r\nbuild expensive stone roads, those having the work in charge will\r\nnaturally employ a competent engineer, or will at least appeal to Prof.\r\nGillespie's work on road-making, or to some other authority. Space need\r\nnot be given here to engineering details, which would require a lengthy\r\nelucidation. There is, however, a sort of road-making materially more\r\ncostly at the outset than that now in vogue, but much less costly in the\r\nlong-run, if we consider the element of practical value and the cost of\r\nmaintenance. It depends more on fundamental principles of construction\r\nthan on special processes of finishing, and will be more or less\r\nsatisfactory according to the character of the soil and of the covering\r\nmaterial available.\r\n\r\nThe great enemy of all roads is excessive moisture; and the chief\r\npurpose of all methods of improvement is to get rid of this, or to\r\ncounteract its effect. As in the case of foot-paths, wherever the porous\r\ncharacter of the subsoil, and the absence of higher-lying wet lands, is\r\nsuch that no accumulation of water upon or under the roadway need be\r\nfeared, the greatest difficulty is at once set aside. Roads lying on\r\nsuch a soil may be over-dusty in dry weather. When the subsoil is\r\ntemporarily impervious because of its frozen condition, they may become\r\nunduly muddy, or, when the situation is such as to lead hill-water upon\r\nthem, they may be badly washed; but they are free from the great\r\ndifficulties that beset all roads which for a large part of the year\r\nare underlaid by an over-saturated, compact subsoil. Where such natural\r\ndrainage is secured, no artificial under-drainage will be needed. In\r\nmany more instances, all that will be required in the way of draining\r\nwill be to lead away the sources of wet-weather springs, which break\r\nthrough the road-bed and cause deep sloughs. Where incomplete or partial\r\nartificial under-draining is needed, the need is absolute; and whether\r\nwe consider the durability of the road, or the degree to which its\r\ntraffic is interfered with by its wet condition, we may be confident\r\nthat every dollar spent in well-directed under-draining will be invested\r\nto the very best advantage. The varying conditions of wetness, and the\r\ndifferent sources of surplus water, must be regarded in deciding\r\nprecisely how much of this work is needed, and how it should be done.\r\nDetails cannot be fully considered here; but as a general rule it may be\r\nsaid, that where the subsoil generally is of an impervious character,\r\nand where the road is more or less wet and weeping after long rains, a\r\ncontinuous system of under-drains is required. If the trouble is local,\r\nhere and there in spots, and is obviously caused by the breaking up of\r\nsprings from the road-bed, such partial work may be adopted as will tap\r\nthe sources of these springs, and lead their water harmlessly away.\r\nGisborne, one of the best agricultural writers of England, put the case\r\ntersely and well when--objecting to the system of circumventing\r\nsprings--he said, \"_Hit him straight in the eye_, is as good a maxim in\r\ndraining as in pugilism.\" It is best not to pass up at the side of a\r\nspring, and so creep around behind it to head off its water; but to\r\ndrive the drain straight through it, and far enough beyond it to tap and\r\nlead away at a lower level the water which causes it. These drains, as\r\nwell as all others intended simply to remove subsoil water, and not to\r\ncut off a weeping stream, are best made with common drain-tiles laid as\r\nbefore directed, and covered immediately with well-packed earth. Water\r\nenters an under-drain, not from above, but from below; that is to say,\r\nas water, from whatever source, fills the subsoil, it rises therein\r\nuntil it reaches the floor of the drain, when it enters and is led away,\r\njust as water falling into a cask which stands on end flows off at the\r\nunder side of the bung-hole when it reaches its level. Even if the cask\r\nbe filled to the top with earth, the rain falling upon it will descend\r\nperpendicularly to the bottom, and will flow off at the bung only when\r\nthe soil to that level has become saturated. It will descend through the\r\nsoil by the straightest course, and will raise the general level. It\r\nwill not violate the laws of gravitation, and run diagonally toward the\r\npoint of outlet, as seems to be the general supposition when the\r\nperplexing question, \"How does water get into the drain?\" is first\r\nconsidered. When we drive a drain through a spring and into the\r\nwater-bearing stratum which feeds it, we simply make it easier for the\r\nwater to escape by the drain than to keep on at the higher level, and\r\nbreak out at the surface of the ground.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the sidewalk illustrated in Figure 1, in cutting off a\r\ncontinuous weeping or ooze from higher land, it is best to introduce a\r\nvertical filling of porous material through which the water will descend\r\nand enter the drain; but, excepting this single instance, all that we\r\nneed to do, so far as subterranean work is concerned, is to furnish an\r\neasy and sufficient channel for the removal of subsoil water.\r\n\r\nWhat constitutes a sufficient drain is something very much less than\r\nwhat is generally supposed. In ordinary agricultural drainage, where the\r\nlines of tiles are forty feet apart, a well-laid tile an inch and a\r\nquarter in diameter is sufficient for a length of one thousand\r\nfeet--that is, it is sufficient to remove the water of filtration from\r\nan acre of land. If laid with only an inclination of six inches in one\r\nhundred feet, its delivery will be so rapid as to amount to more than a\r\nheavy continuous rain-fall upon this area. In road drainage, the same\r\nrule would hold true; but, as the soil offers a certain resistance to\r\nthe rapid descent of water, it is best to give a means of outlet at\r\nsmaller intervals; and for the best work in roads thirty feet wide or\r\nmore, three drains could be used with advantage. In no case, however,\r\nneed the size of pipes be larger than above indicated, if the form of\r\nthe tiles is true, and if they are well joined together at their ends.\r\nTiles of less perfect form had better be an inch and a half or even two\r\ninches in diameter; but, as a rule, they should not be of a larger size,\r\nfor the reason that the amount of water that they may be expected to\r\ncarry will not be sufficient to keep them prop erly freed from silt\r\nunless the flow is concentrated within a narrow channel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nFigure 2 shows the cross section of a country road thirty feet wide,\r\nwith three lines of tile-drain laid at a depth of about three feet below\r\nit. Except in case of necessity, these drains should have an inclination\r\nof not less than six inches in one hundred feet. There is no objection\r\nto their having more than this wherever the lay of the land permits or\r\nrequires it. They may often have considerably less in case of need; but,\r\nthe smaller the rate of inclination, the greater the care needed in\r\nsecuring a true grade. The water of these drains should be collected\r\ninto a single drain, and led away at intervals of from five hundred to\r\none thousand feet. It may be delivered into a roadside gutter, or into a\r\ncollecting under-drain, according to the requirements of the situation.\r\n\r\nIt is now possible to procure drain-tiles at reasonable cost in almost\r\nall parts of the country; and these are not only very much better than\r\nany form of stone drain, but they are also much cheaper in\r\nconstruction,--the labor of preparing and handling the stone, and of\r\nexcavating the wider trench that stone requires, amounting to more than\r\nthe cost of the tile, even with a high charge of transportation added.\r\nIncidentally it is proper to say that where tiles cannot be had, a mass\r\nof gravel or fine cinders, six inches wide and six inches deep, placed\r\nat the bottom of the drain, and _covered with well-packed soil_, is\r\npreferable even to broken stone or any other form of channel that would\r\npermit of the rapid running of water and the washing into the drains of\r\neven a slight amount of silt.\r\n\r\nThe removal of excessive subsoil moisture being secured, attention\r\nshould next be given to the surface of the road, which should be\r\nfinished with the firmest material at hand,--with the common earth of\r\nthe subsoil where nothing better can be afforded,--and which should be\r\nbrought to a true grade, with a _very slight_ slope from the centre to\r\nthe edge. For a road thirty feet wide, the elevation of the centre\r\nabove the level of the edges should not be more than four to six inches,\r\nand the grade should be made on a straight line rather than on a curve.\r\nIf the road is made as flat as the turning-off of surface-water will\r\npermit, it will be travelled upon in all its parts; while if it is\r\ncrowned to a high arch, as is often the case, it will soon be found that\r\nthe best place to drive is in the middle of the road, and foot-tracks\r\nand wheel-tracks will soon form slight channels or ruts which will lead\r\nwater lengthwise along the road, and which will cause an undue amount of\r\nwear and washing. A road may be actually flat to the eye, and equally\r\nconvenient for travel at every part of its width, and still have enough\r\nlateral slope to cause water to run off from it.\r\n\r\nIt is especially desirable that no surface-water flowing from the\r\nroadside (above all, when frost is coming out of the ground in the\r\nspring) be permitted to run on to the road. This should be effectively\r\nprevented by the formation of sufficient gutters, with such outlets as\r\nwill prevent ponding at the sides of the road. When it is necessary to\r\ncarry the water of the gutters from one side of the road to the other,\r\nculverts should be provided; and wherever the slope of the road is\r\nsufficient to cause water to flow along it lengthwise,--that is,\r\nwherever the inclination is more than about one in fifty,--there should\r\nbe frequent slight depressions from the centre diagonally toward the\r\ngutters to carry the flow away before it can accumulate sufficiently to\r\nform a washing current.\r\n\r\nIf it can be done without hauling additional material, it is always well\r\nto raise the road-bed somewhat above the level of the adjoining land,\r\nand this may usually be accomplished by throwing upon it the subsoil of\r\nthe gutters. In no case should surface-soil sods or fine road-mud be\r\nused for repairs. The most serious objection to the absurd system of\r\nroad-mending so common in this country lies in the fact that the annual\r\nrepairing is little more than the ploughing up and throwing back upon\r\nthe roadway of the soft and unsuitable material which has been washed\r\ninto the gutters.\r\n\r\nWhat is said above applies especially to country roads; but it is\r\nappropriate, so far as it goes, to the better-made and better-kept roads\r\nof a village. In the case of these latter, except where the soil is\r\nnaturally dry and firm, some attention should be given to the\r\nimprovement of the surface; and it is to be considered whether to adopt\r\nthe expensive process of covering with broken stone road-metal, or to\r\nuse gravel. One or the other of these is desirable in all cases where\r\nthere is much tendency to sloppiness in wet weather; but any form of\r\nartificial covering is so costly that the early efforts of the\r\nimprovement association will produce a more telling result if applied in\r\nother directions. The necessary cross-walks may be satisfactorily made\r\nwith coal-ashes.\r\n\r\nIt is even more easy in a village than in the country, to have the\r\ngrades of all roadways so regulated as to shed rain-water falling upon\r\nthem, and to have them so furnished with side gutters so as to prevent\r\nwater from the roadside from running on to them. The simplest way to\r\neffect this, and the neatest way too, is to make gutters outside of the\r\nline of the road, say six inches deep and eight feet wide, these being\r\nat once sodded or sown with grass and grain to give an early protection\r\nagainst washing; made on such a shallow curve, they will afford no\r\nobstruction to any system of mowing that may be adopted, while their\r\ngreat width will give them sufficient capacity to carry away the water\r\nof considerable storms.\r\n\r\nThe work of construction having been duly attended to, it is no less\r\nimportant to provide for regular and constant care. Any rutting that\r\ncomes of heavy traffic in bad weather should be obliterated either by\r\nraking, or, better still, by filling the ruts with gravel or ashes. If\r\nsuch work is attended to immediately on the occasion for it arising, the\r\namount of labor required will be very slight; for it is especially true\r\nwith reference to roads, that \"a stitch in time saves nine.\" If the\r\nfilling of ruts and wheel-tracks be done in time, the serious damage\r\nthat comes from guttering flows of water lengthwise along the road may\r\nbe almost entirely avoided.\r\n\r\nThe mere cleaning work of both the roadway and roadside grass spaces, it\r\nwill be easy to induce children to perform for slight rewards and\r\nencouragement. The daily removal of bits of paper and other rubbish will\r\nhave an excellent effect on the general appearance of the village. In\r\nthe autumn the removal of the fallen leaves will call for something\r\nmore than children's work; but ordinarily this source of cheap labor\r\nwill be found sufficient if properly directed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC WATER SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nAs a field for encouragement, rather than as an object for the\r\nexpenditure of the association's funds, the furnishing of an ample\r\nsupply of water is entitled to very early consideration. Not only is the\r\nquestion of public health very seriously involved in the water problem;\r\nbut as a mere beautifying element an abundance of water, to be obtained\r\nwithout labor, will have a very telling effect by the facility it gives\r\nfor preserving the fresh appearance of lawns and shrubbery, and for the\r\ncultivation of flowers and vines.\r\n\r\nRegarded from the horticulturist's point of view, the climate of pretty\r\nnearly the whole of this country is simply detestable. We may arrange to\r\nwithstand very well the severity of our northern winters; we expect an\r\nentire shutting-up of all garden industries, and long cold seasons are\r\nan accustomed matter of necessity: but we have never yet learned to\r\naccept with patience the almost annual destruction of our lawns and\r\ngardens and flower-beds by scathing drought. No public water supply\r\navailable for an ordinary village would suffice to overcome the effects\r\nof a dry season over the whole of even a small homestead; but we may\r\nhope to secure enough to keep one or two small sprinklers flowing\r\nsteadily through the hot months, and so keep a little grass measurably\r\ngreen, and preserve a semblance of life and beauty in flower-beds and\r\ndelicate shrubbery. It is very rarely that it will be possible to supply\r\nwater enough in a whole week to equal in its effect a half-hour's rain;\r\nbut the difference between towns where even the small amount of water is\r\navailable for the garden and those which are hopelessly given over to\r\ndrought shows how much may be accomplished in this direction even with\r\nlimited means.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of road-making in any thing like a complete and thorough\r\nmanner, the providing of a water supply must necessarily be directed by\r\nprofessional advice. Although the simpler principles of hydraulics are\r\nsufficiently understood, and although it would be quite within the\r\nability of a number of the more intelligent men of any village to secure\r\nand distribute a satisfactory amount of water, the cost of doing such\r\nwork in an experimental way by persons unaccustomed to its details, as\r\ncompared with the cost of doing it under the direction of an engineer\r\nwhose natural judgment and capacity are supplemented by experience and\r\nskill, would be without doubt far beyond the fee demanded for his\r\nservices. In this case, as in many others connected with public and\r\nprivate works, it is always bad economy to save the cost of proper\r\nknowledge. Very likely--perhaps indeed very generally--the actual\r\nperformance of the work, the buying and laying of the pipe, and all\r\nthat, can be as cheaply done under home direction as under that of a\r\npublic contractor; but the making of the plans--the deciding upon the\r\nsource of the supply, upon the means for securing a sufficient head, the\r\nsizes of the pipes, the location and construction of fire-plugs, and all\r\nthe minor details of the work--will be more or less economical,\r\naccording to the skill, experience, and capacity of the person who\r\ndirects it.\r\n\r\nThe sources from which water may be obtained are various. Often enough\r\nwater of the best quality may be procured by driven, dug, or artesian\r\nwells; but, whenever this course is adopted, the wells should be located\r\nfar enough away from the village, or on land sufficiently high, to make\r\nit impossible that there shall be any fouling of the water-bearing\r\nstrata by the filtration from barn-yards, privy-vaults, or cesspools.\r\nGenerally, water so secured will have to be raised to an elevated\r\nreservoir by some mechanical force. If the demand is to be a large one,\r\nand if the community can afford the cost, the most reliable plan will be\r\nto use steam-power for pumping; but in smaller places, and where economy\r\nis a great object, wind-power may serve an excellent purpose.\r\n\r\nIf a stream of pure water is available at a sufficient height, it may be\r\nled directly to the reservoir, or its current may be used to drive a\r\nwater-wheel sufficient to do the pumping. In a majority of cases there\r\nwill be found at no great distance a stream capable of supplying the\r\nwater needed throughout the dryest season of the year, but not entirely\r\nfree from organic impurities. In such cases it is often feasible, by\r\nexcavating a filtering sump or pump-well at a little distance from the\r\nside of the stream, and at a sufficient depth below the level of its bed\r\nto secure a supply tolerably purified by filtration through the\r\nintervening earth. The distance at which this sump should be placed from\r\nthe bed of the stream will depend on the character of the soil. The more\r\nporous this is, the greater should the distance be. This question as to\r\nthe source from which the water is to be taken is one which, more than\r\nany other, calls for experienced judgment.\r\n\r\nFrequently the conformation of the surrounding country is such that,\r\neven where there is no constant stream, it is possible by the\r\nconstruction of dams to pond an amount of water, to be furnished by\r\nsurface washing, sufficient to supply the demands of the longest\r\ndrought. In this case, as in all others where reservoirs are used, it is\r\nimportant to have a good depth of water, and not to allow, even toward\r\nthe edges, any considerable shallow area. So far as possible, the depth\r\nshould be everywhere great enough to prevent vegetation, and in all the\r\nshallower parts the surface soil should be entirely removed. As a rule,\r\nthere should be a depth of at least fifteen feet of water, except near\r\nthe very edges of the pond, and as much more than this as circumstances\r\nwill allow.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of water for private use is a simple question of\r\nconstruction; but, as a matter of taste, too vehement a protest cannot\r\nbe entered against the common misconception as to what is desirable in\r\nthe way of public fountains. An instance in point is furnished by the\r\npublic drinking-fountain in Newport. Some years ago there stood at the\r\nfoot of the Parade a grand old stone bowl, hewn out of a solid block of\r\ngranite, and filled by a pipe leading from a copious spring. This was a\r\ngood, sensible, substantial drinking-trough, perfectly adapted to its\r\nuse, unpretending and handsome. Later, a public-spirited gentleman,\r\ndesiring to leave a monument of his regard for the city, gave a\r\nconsiderable sum to be used in providing a suitable drinking-fountain at\r\nthis point. Those who had the control of the fund lacked either the good\r\ntaste or the courage to refuse to expend it. The result is that this\r\ngranite horse-basin--one of the best of its sort--has been removed to an\r\nobscure position; and there has been erected in its place a wretched\r\ncast-iron combination of bad architecture and bad statuary, such as form\r\na conspicuous defacement of the public squares in Philadelphia, where\r\nthey serve the double purpose of furnishing water to the people, and\r\nadvertising a cheap clothing establishment. The one compensation for the\r\nviolation of good taste inseparable from these constructions is to be\r\nfound in the fact that they must, sooner or later, lead the public to\r\nrealize the absolute unfitness of cast iron for monumental and\r\ndecorative uses. With the artistic influences which are now so active in\r\nthe instruction of the American people, it is not perhaps unreasonable\r\nto look forward to the day when all of these piles of pot-metal shall be\r\nrelegated to the scrap-heap, and when less offensive fountains shall\r\ntake their place. We may even hope to see the iron statue and its\r\nstove-like support which supplies water to the horses of Newport\r\ncondemned to the foundry, and its solid old predecessor restored to the\r\nposition which it ornamented for so many years.\r\n\r\nA wide margin may be allowed for the exercise of taste in the\r\narrangement of village fountains; and where private munificence enables\r\nthe expenditure of a considerable sum, a good amount of exterior\r\ndecoration may be admissible: but it should always be borne in mind that\r\nso much of the outlay as is needed for the purpose should go to secure\r\na good artistic design. Especially should the use of cast iron be\r\navoided, as being from every point of view, and under all circumstances,\r\nwhether in the shape of cast-iron dogs or deer, or attempts at the\r\ndivine human form, absolutely and entirely inadmissible for artistic\r\nuses. Better a dug-out log horse-trough, overflowing through a notch in\r\nits side, as an ornament to the best-kept village green, than the most\r\nelaborate pitcher-spilling nymph that was ever cast in an iron-foundry.\r\nSo far as the mere construction work of public drinking-fountains and\r\nhorse-troughs is concerned, not much need be said except in connection\r\nwith the overflow. In cold climates, there is apt to be from all such\r\nstructures a spilling of water which covers the ground for some distance\r\nwith ice. This may be avoided by carrying the overflow by a vertical\r\npipe descending through the body of the water by some well-protected\r\nchannel directly into a drain in the ground, at a depth beyond the\r\ndirect action of frosts. If the stream is constant, this depth need be\r\nnothing like that to which frost penetrates into the soil,--for the\r\nconstant movement of the water will prevent its freezing, even if\r\ncovered only a foot deep, though to something more than this depth it\r\nwill be desirable to have the metal pipe enclosed in a larger pipe of\r\nearthenware, giving a space of enclosed air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhere there is no public supply of water, it is better in most cases\r\n(considering the nearness of wells in villages to cesspools and\r\nprivy-vaults), to depend entirely upon cisterns. In our climate, where\r\nrain is abundant during a considerable portion of the year, the water\r\nfalling upon the roof of any house, if properly collected and stored, is\r\nample for the whole supply of the family which that roof shelters. This\r\nwater as it falls is ordinarily free from any impurity that can affect\r\nits taste, and from every source of serious fouling; though, after a\r\nlong-continued drought, it is well to divert and discharge upon the\r\nsurface of the ground the first ten minutes' flow of a shower, so that\r\nthe impurities of the air and the dust of the roof may first be removed.\r\nAfter this first dash, lead to the cistern all that follows. Even with\r\nthis precaution, the water will be more agreeable for use if filtered.\r\nThere are numerous systems for making filters in cisterns, but no other\r\nis so simple nor so durable and satisfactory as the separation of that\r\npart of the cistern from which the suction-pipe leads by a wall of brick\r\nand cement. It is simply necessary to build a wall of brick set on edge\r\n(two and a half inches thick), so as to include about one-quarter of the\r\narea of the bottom, sloping it back so as to terminate against the side\r\nof the cistern at a height of from four to six feet. This wall should be\r\nso well cemented at its joints that water can only pass through the\r\nmaterial of brick, and for strength its form should be slightly bulging.\r\nA wall of this sort, measuring say six feet at its base, and rising to a\r\nheight of six feet at its highest point, will transmit an amount of\r\nwater sufficient to supply the demand of the most constant pumping that\r\nany domestic use can require.\r\n\r\n\r\nSQUARES AND PUBLIC SPACES.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, the open spaces in a country village are subject to no other\r\ncriticism than that of neglect; but the exceptions are not rare where an\r\nattempt at improvement has resulted in a sort of cemetery look that\r\ngives any thing but a cheerful, pleasure-ground aspect.\r\n\r\nThere is not much danger that persons who are enthusiastic for the\r\nimprovement of the town in which they live will err on the side of too\r\ngreat simplicity. The public squares and parks of large and wealthy\r\ncities are regulated and maintained at great cost and under skilful and\r\nartistic management; and they cannot fail to strike country visitors as\r\nbeing in all ways desirable. So indeed they are. They are a chief\r\nelement of the city's beauty, and, from an aesthetic point of view, their\r\ninfluence is the best to which its people are subjected. But their\r\nbeauty and their aesthetic influence are both the result of a\r\nwell-directed expenditure of large sums of money. It is quite natural\r\nthat an enriched manufacturer or merchant, proud of his native village,\r\nshould be ambitious to perpetuate the memory of his benefaction by\r\nproviding for some corresponding decoration of its public green, and\r\nthat he should attempt to reproduce there, on the smaller scale\r\nproportionate to the circumstances, the sort of magnificence that he has\r\nseen in the city park. If left to his own sweet will,--as he often is if\r\nhe is willing to spend money for the public benefit,--he will, unless a\r\nrich man of the rarer sort, succeed only in producing a conspicuous\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\nA park-railing of artistically-worked wrought-iron will be represented\r\nby a cast-iron substitute of much more elaborate device; and there will\r\nprobably be \"piled on,\" here and there, an amount of cheap ornamentation\r\nwhich at the first glance will have a certain imposing effect. In the\r\nmatter of planting there may be an amount and variety of foreign\r\nshrubbery and sub-tropical plants, which, under proper care, would be of\r\ngreat value and beauty, but which, with the neglect to which they are\r\ndoomed in their village home, are quite certain to abort. In fact, we\r\nmay expect to see, what indeed we may now see, in painful degree, in\r\nmany of our smaller towns, a halting attempt at the outside show of the\r\ncity park, which, in the absence of those elements of artistic selection\r\nand appropriateness to the conditions which are to prevail, develop, as\r\ntime goes on, into an ignominious failure.\r\n\r\nThe trouble is, that, in all expenditures of this sort, we are apt to\r\nbegin at the wrong end. In the making of a park, every step that is\r\ntaken, whether the park be large or small, is a costly one; and, if\r\ntaken in their reverse order, every step is a wasted one. The chief\r\nreason why the final decoration of a city park is so satisfactory is\r\nthat it is only the crowning work of many processes which have had the\r\nbest and most careful attention from the outset. The wrought-iron\r\ngrille, the architectural fountain, the bronze statue, the delicate\r\ntrees and shrubbery, and the smoothly-finished walks and drives, depend\r\nfor their success upon a vast amount of costly fundamental work, and a\r\nprovision for constant skilful care, which have cost a deal of money,\r\nand which look to a large permanent outlay. The elaborate fence must\r\nstand on no unstable foundation; the fountain must be only the\r\nornamental central point of artistic and well-kept lawns and approaches;\r\nthe statue must stand amid appropriate surroundings; and all but the\r\nsimpler native vegetation must have its suitable soil, and be insured\r\nits needed protection and care at all seasons. The degree to which these\r\nmore ornamental features may be given to the village green with any hope\r\nof satisfaction will depend almost entirely upon the thoroughness with\r\nwhich it has been prepared to receive them. Could the enthusiastic\r\nmembers of the improvement association be brought face to face with the\r\ncost that is needed for quite hidden fundamental work in order to\r\nprepare their green for the more elaborate artistic decoration, they\r\nwould be deterred at the outset from attempting any thing so ambitious.\r\nCould they know the cost of the mere work of grading and subsoil\r\ncultivation, under-draining, manuring, laying the deep foundation for\r\nfoot-paths, and securing that perfect growth of grass without which all\r\npark-like ornament is robbed of half its value, they would set their\r\nfaces resolutely against all propositions on the part of public-spirited\r\ncitizens to veneer their unprepared grounds with misplaced exterior\r\nadornment.\r\n\r\nIf money enough can be provided to do the work thoroughly well from its\r\nvery foundation, then of course nothing more is needed than that its\r\ndirection be placed in accomplished hands; but unless this is fully\r\nassured, if--as is nearly always the case,--economy is the first thing\r\nto be considered, then the rule of action is fully stated in two words,\r\n_simplicity_ and _thoroughness_.\r\n\r\nAvoid all fantastic ornament, and all decoration of every sort, that\r\nwould be appropriate only to work of a more complete and substantial\r\ncharacter. Let whatever is done be done in the most thorough way. If the\r\nability is only enough to secure good grass, then do every thing that is\r\nnecessary to furnish the best conditions for the growth of grass, make\r\nsuitable provision for its care, and attempt nothing further. Good\r\nlawn-like grass surfaces, crossed only by foot-worn pathways over the\r\nturf, will be more beautiful and more satisfactory than will poor grass\r\nand cheaply made and ill-kept walks.\r\n\r\nIf something more than securing the best grass is possible, then let the\r\nnext expenditure be in the direction of paths, applying to the\r\nconstruction of these the principles set forth in what has hitherto been\r\nsaid about sidewalks. In the case of level walks, with imperfect means\r\nof drainage, it is often desirable to secure the better foundation that\r\nis given by filling in to the depth of a foot or more with small stone.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the natural character of the soil, unless always well\r\ndrained by a porous subsoil, the first step toward establishing a good\r\nlawn is to secure perfect underdrainage. Establish a good outlet at the\r\ndepth of three and a half or four feet below the surface at the lowest\r\npoint of the area to be drained, and then, selecting the necessary lines\r\nfor main drains, lay out parallel lines (thirty feet apart at a depth of\r\nthree and a half feet, or forty feet apart at a depth of four feet) to\r\ninclude the whole area, and on these lines lay well-constructed drains\r\nof small open-jointed tiles. Cover these tiles with the most compact\r\nearth that has been excavated, and, after filling to a depth of one\r\nfoot, tramp or ram this earth tightly. Then fill the rest of the trench,\r\nheaping over the lines any excess of material that may need the settling\r\neffect of heavy rains to work it into place.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to reverse or thoroughly mix the whole soil to a depth\r\nof at least fifteen inches. This work can be completely done only with\r\nthe aid of hand-shovelling, but the aid of the plough will greatly\r\nfacilitate it. Its purpose is to secure such an admixture of the organic\r\nmatter of the surface soil with the more compact material of the subsoil\r\nas will make it sufficiently porous and fertile for the easy\r\npenetration of roots. It is best that this work should be done in\r\nautumn; and, if the land is level, that the freshly raised subsoil\r\nshould be left exposed in its rough and lumpy condition--without\r\nharrowing--to the frosts of winter. If washing is to be apprehended,\r\nthen sow the ground thickly with rye, harrowing in the seed only\r\nroughly. If the seed is sown early enough, the growth will be sufficient\r\nto protect the surface from washing. During the winter, let the whole\r\nsurface be heavily covered with stable-manure,--the more heavily the\r\nbetter, as there is no limit to the amount of coarse manure that may\r\nwith advantage be used for the establishment of permanent grass. In the\r\nspring, as soon as the ground is dry enough to work easily, plough in\r\nthe manure with as shallow furrows as will suffice to cover the most of\r\nit; then harrow repeatedly, bringing the surface to as true a grade as\r\npossible, and sow it heavily with a mixture of Rhode Island bent grass,\r\nKentucky blue grass, and white clover. As soon as the seed is well\r\nsprouted, showing green over the whole ground, roll the area repeatedly\r\nand thoroughly until it is as smooth and hard as it is possible to make\r\nit. As soon as the grass has attained the height of three inches, let\r\nit be cut with a lawn-mower, and let the cutting be repeated at least\r\nweekly throughout the season of rapid growth, and as often as necessary\r\nuntil the end of autumn.\r\n\r\nIf paths are to be made, it will simplify matters to make them after the\r\ngrass has become well established, supposing only a good surface footway\r\nof ashes or concrete to be needed; for the small amount of excavation\r\nnecessary under either of these systems may be scattered over the grass\r\nspaces without injury. But if the more thorough system is adopted of\r\nunderlaying the walk with a foot or more of stones, then the work,\r\nexcept the final dressing of gravel or ashes, should be done in the\r\nautumn, or, in any case, before the final preparation of the soil for\r\nseeding.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nConcerning trees and ornamental shrubbery for parks and open spaces, it\r\nis not possible to give detailed directions here, beyond recommending,\r\nas in the case of roadside plantations, that, unless the work is to\r\nremain permanently in the charge of an experienced gardener, with the\r\nnecessary appliances for the care and protection of the more delicate\r\nspecimens, the arrangement and the selection should be confined to the\r\nmore hardy and vigorous trees and shrubs which experience has shown to\r\nbe adapted to the climate and soil of the locality.\r\n\r\nFor roadsides, and largely in parks and village greens, the world offers\r\nno tree that can compare in dignity and grace with the broad-spreading\r\nAmerican elm; though, for the sake of variety, and for the sake of an\r\nearlier effect, many other trees may be added.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVILLAGE SANITARY WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a recently recognized but an old and universal truth, that human\r\nlife involves the production of refuse matters, which, unless proper\r\nsafeguards are taken, are sure to become a source of disease and death.\r\nThe danger is not confined alone nor chiefly to that element of\r\nhousehold waste which is most manifestly offensive, but in almost equal\r\ndegree to all manner of organic refuse. It is true that faecal matters\r\nare often accompanied by the inciting agent of the propagation of\r\ninfectious diseases. For convenience, and as indicating the more\r\nprobable means for disseminating infection, we may call this agent\r\n\"germs.\" It has not yet been demonstrated with scientific completeness\r\nthat a disease is spread by living germs whose growth in a new body\r\nproduces a corresponding disorder; but all that is known of the\r\ncircumstances of infection, and of the means for preventing it, may be\r\nfully explained by this theory. Typhoid fever, cholera, epidemic\r\ndiarrh[oe]a, and some other prevalent diseases, are presumed by the germ\r\ntheory to be chiefly, if not entirely, propagated by germs thrown off by\r\na diseased body. So far as these ailments are concerned, there is\r\ntherefore a very serious element of danger added in the case of faeces to\r\nthe other evil effects which are produced by an improper disposal of any\r\nrefuse organic matter. That any one or all of these diseases can\r\noriginate from the decomposition, under certain circumstances of faecal\r\nmatters, is not clearly determined. There is, however, good reason for\r\nbelieving that one common effect of the gases arising from improperly\r\ntreated matters of this kind is to debilitate the human system, and so\r\nto create a disposition to receive contagion, or to succumb to minor\r\ndiseases which are not contagious.\r\n\r\nThe same debilitating effect and the same injurious influences often\r\nresult from the neglect of other organic wastes. The refuse of the\r\nkitchen sink is free from faecal matter; but it contains, in a greater or\r\nless degree, precisely the kind of organic material which has gone to\r\nmake up the more offensive substance. If its final disposition is such\r\nas to contaminate the water that we drink or the air that we breathe\r\nwith the products of their decay, the danger to life is hardly less than\r\nthat from the decomposition of faecal accumulations.\r\n\r\nIt is proposed now to set forth, in the simplest way and without much\r\ndiscussion of principles (which may be studied elsewhere), the methods\r\nand processes by which village households and communities may be\r\nprotected against the influences that come from an excess of\r\nsoil-moisture, from damp walls, and from imperfect removal or improper\r\ndisposal of organic filth.\r\n\r\nWe will assume that a village has a water supply sufficient to admit of\r\nthe use of water-closets in all houses, and to furnish a good flushing\r\nfor kitchen sinks, &c. A necessary complement of this work--indeed, it\r\nshould properly precede it--is the establishment of a system of sewers\r\nby which all of this liquid outflow may be carried safely away. It would\r\nbe out of the question in a small or scattered community, especially\r\nwhere roadways are unpaved, to establish any system which should\r\ninclude in its working the removal of surface water. The moment we\r\nundertake to make sewers of sufficient capacity to carry away the storm\r\nwater of large districts, then we enormously increase the scale and cost\r\nof the work.\r\n\r\nSo far as the removal of house sewage alone is concerned, the work need\r\nby no means be very costly. If a tolerable inclination can be given to\r\nthe line of sewers,--say a fall of one in two hundred,--a six-inch pipe\r\nwill have a capacity quite up to the requirements of a village of two\r\nthousand inhabitants using one hundred gallons of water per day per\r\nhead. It will, however, be safe to use a pipe of this size only when it\r\nis true in form and carefully laid, so that there shall be no retarding\r\nof the flow at the joints from the intrusion of mortar, or any other\r\nform of irregularity. Unless the joints are wiped quite smooth, the\r\nroughness remaining will serve as a nucleus for the accumulation of\r\nhair, shreds of cloth, and other matters which will hold silt and\r\ngrease, and form in time a serious obstruction. Nothing smaller than\r\nsix-inch pipe should be adopted for a street sewer. Unless the work is\r\nto be most carefully done, for all but the branch lines, for a\r\npopulation of five thousand, or less according to the fall of the sewer,\r\nit will be safer to use eight-inch pipes. These pipes must be laid with\r\ngreat accuracy as to grade and direction. All corners should be turned\r\nwith curves of large radius and regular sweep, and with an additional\r\nfall to compensate for the increased resistance of curves. The weight of\r\nthe pipe should not be supported upon the sockets (see Figure 3), partly\r\nas a question of strength, and partly because any irregularity of form\r\nor thickness of the socket would change the inclination of the sewer.\r\nThe bottom of the trench being brought exactly to the required grade,\r\nlet there be dug out a depression greater than the projection of the\r\nsocket, the pipe resting upon its finished bottom for its whole length.\r\n(See Figure 4.) Too much care cannot be given to the thorough filling\r\nwith cement of the space between the socket and the pipe inserted into\r\nit; the whole circle being well flushed and wiped, so that there may be\r\nno possibility of leakage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3 PIPES RESTING ON THEIR SHOULDERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. PIPES RESTING ON THEIR FULL LENGTH.]\r\n\r\nThe objection to leakage is twofold: sewage matters escaping into the\r\nsoil might contaminate wells and springs; and it would also rob the flow\r\nthrough the pipes of water needed to carry forward the more solid\r\ncontents. The continued efficiency of these small drains for carrying\r\naway the solid or semi-solid outflow of the house is dependent very\r\nlargely upon the presence of sufficient water to create a scouring\r\ncurrent. While eight-inch pipes are admissible as a safeguard against\r\nimperfect laying, they are liable to the grave objection, that, where\r\nthe service to be performed is greatly less than their capacity, the\r\nstream flowing through them will not be sufficiently concentrated to\r\ncarry forward the more solid parts of the sewage. Up to the limit of\r\ntheir capacity, six-inch pipes properly laid are greatly to be\r\npreferred, as insuring a deeper stream which will more generally attain\r\nthe velocity of three feet per second, needed to move the heavier\r\nconstituents of the sewage. The difference in cost between six-inch and\r\neight-inch pipes will be sufficient to cover any extra cost of the most\r\ncareful workmanship. However much attention may be given to the\r\ncementing of the joints, it will be impossible to prevent the running\r\ninto the pipes of a certain amount of mortar; and the workman should\r\nhave a swab or a disk of India rubber of the exact size of the bore of\r\nthe pipe, with a short handle attached to its middle, to draw forward as\r\neach joint is finished, and so scrape away any excess of mortar before\r\nit hardens.\r\n\r\nWherever it is, or may probably become, necessary to attach a\r\nhouse-drain or land-drain, there should be used a length of pipe having\r\na side branch, oblique to the direction of the flow, to receive such\r\nconnection. The location of these branches should be accurately\r\nindicated on the plan; and they should be closed with a flat stone or a\r\nbit of slate, well cemented in place.\r\n\r\nIt will at times be necessary to use larger conduits than even an\r\neight-inch pipe. Up to a diameter of fifteen inches, it is cheapest to\r\nuse pipes, but for eighteen inches or more, brick-work is cheaper; and\r\nat that size--a considerable regular flow of water being insured--the\r\nslight roughness of brick-work offers no serious objection. The use of\r\noval or egg-shaped sewers will rarely be necessary under the\r\ncircumstances that we are considering; but there may be exceptional\r\nconditions where the covering-in of a brook, or storm-water course,\r\ncannot be avoided; and in such cases the volume of water may vary so\r\ngreatly that there will at times be a mere thread of a stream, and at\r\ntimes a torrent. Here the oval form is the best, as concentrating a\r\nsmall flow within a narrow and deep channel, and still giving the\r\ncapacity needed for exceptionally large volumes. All bricks used for\r\nsewers, man-holes, &c., should be of the very hardest quality, and true\r\nin form. The general rule is to be kept in mind, that the thickness of\r\nthe wall of a brick sewer should not be less than one-ninth of the inner\r\ndiameter; that is to say, that up to a diameter of three feet the\r\nthickness of the wall should equal the width of a brick,--four inches.\r\nThis applies to circular sewers only: the oval form, being less strong,\r\ncalls for a wall of a thickness equal to one-eighth of the largest\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nConnecting drains leading from houses to the sewer are to be made at\r\nprivate cost; but they should be made in accordance with plans furnished\r\nby the public authority, and by a workman acceptable to that authority.\r\n\r\nThe householder might be permitted to take the responsibility of the\r\nfinishing of his drain, but for the fact that the working of the public\r\nsewer calls for the largest amount of water in proportion to the amount\r\nof solid matters that it is possible to secure, and thus makes it\r\nimperative that this drain should be absolutely tight, so that the\r\nliquid parts of the house outflow shall not trickle away through its\r\njoints, leaving only the more solid parts to flow into the public sewer.\r\n\r\nProperly graded and smoothly jointed, a four-inch pipe will carry more\r\nwater than even the largest boarding-house or country hotel is likely to\r\ndischarge. There is, however, a tendency in all house-drains to become\r\nfilled in the early part of their course by the accumulation of grease\r\nand solid matters caught in the grease. Where no form of grease-trap is\r\nused, there is a certain argument in favor of the use of six-inch pipes\r\nfor the upper part of house-drains. The use of a grease-trap, however,\r\nshould always be insisted upon; and with its aid these obstructing\r\nmatters will be retained, and the outflow may be perfectly carried by a\r\nfour-inch pipe.\r\n\r\nSo far as the public sewer is concerned, it makes little difference what\r\nis the size of the house connection drain through the greater part of\r\nits course; but the junction with the sewer should, under no\r\ncircumstances, where six-inch sewer-pipes are adopted, be more than four\r\ninches. I should even insist on four-inch connections with an eight-inch\r\nsewer. Through neglect, or by reason of improper management, many kinds\r\nof rubbish find their way into house-drains; and a four-inch opening\r\nwill admit as many of these into the sewer as it will be able to carry\r\naway. If, by reason of bad construction or neglect, an obstruction is to\r\nbe caused at any point, it should be in the drain, which the person\r\nresponsible for it must cleanse or repair.\r\n\r\nThe grease-trap referred to above may be any form of reservoir which\r\nwill retain the flow from the kitchen sink until it has time to cool,\r\nwhen its grease will be solidified, and will float at the surface. The\r\noutlet from this trap should be at such a distance below the surface of\r\nthe water, that there will be no danger of its floating matter passing\r\nin with the discharge. A very simple device for this purpose is shown in\r\nFigure 5. From a trap of this sort the flow is constant whenever\r\nadditions are made to its contents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--GREASE-TRAP. I, Inlet; V, ventilator; O,\r\noutlet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--FIELD'S FLUSH-TANK.\r\n\r\nA, Receiver; B, grating; C, ventilator; D, siphon; F, entrance to drain;\r\nI, delivery from sink.]\r\n\r\nFigure 6 shows the invention of an English engineer, Mr. Rogers Field,\r\nwhich has the effect of retaining all of the outflow from the kitchen\r\nsink until it is entirely filled,--say thirty gallons. When filled, any\r\nsudden addition of a few quarts of water, as from the emptying of a\r\ndish-pan, brings into action a siphon whose entrance is near the bottom\r\nof the tank; and this siphon rapidly discharges all of the contents\r\nabove its mouth in a flow having sufficient force to carry forward not\r\nonly any solid matters which it may contain, but also any ordinary\r\nobstructing accumulations in the drain below. The soil-pipe, carrying\r\nthe discharge of water-closets, should not be delivered into the\r\nflush-tank, but at a point farther down the drain, so that any solid\r\nmatter it may deposit shall be swept forward by the next action of the\r\nflush-tank. The more often the flush-tank is filled, and the greater the\r\nproportion of its water to its impurities, the more efficient will be\r\nits action. Therefore the slop closet waste leading from the upper\r\nstory, and even the outlet pipes of bathing-tubs, may with advantage be\r\ndelivered into it.\r\n\r\nAlthough the flush-tank may receive no faecal matter, and even though the\r\nhousemaid's sink may not deliver into it, it will contain in the\r\ndischarge from the kitchen alone an amount of organic matter which will\r\nproduce offensive and dangerous gases by its decomposition. To provide\r\nfor the safe removal of these gases, a ventilating pipe should be\r\ncarried up to some point not near to any window or chimney-top.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the sewers are ready for service no accumulation of faecal\r\nmatter or other organic household waste should be allowed to remain in\r\nthe village. All old vaults and cesspools should be filled with earth,\r\nand disinfected by the admixture of lime with the upper layers of the\r\nfilling. The use of water-closets in all houses should be made\r\nimperative; and the construction and arrangement of soil-pipes and of\r\nall outlets should be regulated by the health authorities.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while here to discuss the details of the construction\r\nof water-closets and other interior plumbing work, except with reference\r\nto soil-pipes and such drains as may deliver the outflow of soil-pipes\r\nto the public sewer. The soil-pipe should be of cast iron, carefully\r\njointed with lead, not less than four inches in diameter, and carried by\r\nthe straightest course possible up through the roof and generally higher\r\nthan the ridge-pole. Its open top must not be near any window, and if\r\nwithin ten feet of a chimney it should be at least one foot below the\r\nlevel of the top of that chimney. There should be no trap in the\r\nsoil-pipe, and no trap in a private drain between the outlet of the\r\nsoil-pipe and the sewer. The reasons for this rule are twofold:--\r\n\r\n1. No matter what amount of water may be used for flushing out the\r\nsoil-pipe, its sides will always be more or less coated with organic\r\nfilth; and, however slight this coating, there will be a certain amount\r\nof decomposition. The decomposition of all such matters must be rapid\r\nand complete, not slow and partial. A necessary condition of complete\r\ndestructive decomposition is an abundance of atmospheric air to supply\r\nthe oxygen which complete decomposition demands. If the soil-pipe is\r\nclosed at its top, or if it is obstructed by a trap in the lower part of\r\nits course, there can be no such circulation of air as safety requires.\r\n\r\nIf there is an opportunity for the free admission of air from the\r\nwell-ventilated sewer to feed the upward current almost constantly\r\nprevailing in a soil-pipe open at both ends, the gases resulting from\r\nthe decomposition will be of a different and less injurious character\r\nthan where the air is confined,--and by the mere volume of air passing\r\nthrough the pipe they will be so diluted that even were they originally\r\npoisonous their power for harm will be lessened.\r\n\r\nThe gases formed by the decomposition of organic matter in the sewer\r\nitself, or in the soil-pipe, have a certain expansive force which is\r\ngreatly increased by the elevation of temperature, caused, for example,\r\nby the discharge of hot water into the pipe or sewer. If the soil-pipe\r\nis open at its upper end this expansion will be at once relieved; but if\r\nthe top of the pipe be closed there will always be danger of the forcing\r\nof the feeble barrier offered by the ordinary water-seal trap of a\r\nbranch pipe leading from a wash-basin or sink. Then, too, the\r\nsealing-water of the trap readily absorbs any foul gases presented at\r\nits outer end, toward the soil-pipe, and gives it off in an unchanged\r\ncondition at the inner or house end. Such traps retard, but do not\r\nprevent, the entrance of sewer gases into the house. Water-seal traps\r\nwhich are unused for any considerable time are emptied by evaporation,\r\nand thus open a channel through which the air of the soil-pipe may find\r\nits way into the house.\r\n\r\nIt is usual in modern plumbing to relieve the pressure of gas in the\r\nsoil-pipe by what is called a \"stench-pipe.\" This is a pipe from one to\r\ntwo inches in diameter, leading from the highest point of the soil-pipe\r\nto the outside of the roof, where it is bent over to prevent the\r\nentrance of foreign matter, or is closed at the top and perforated with\r\nholes to allow the gas to escape. This small stench-pipe is inadequate\r\nfor the necessary work. It is very important that there be the freest\r\npossible channel for the movement of air; and nothing will suffice for\r\nthis save the continuing of the pipe, at its full size, to its very\r\noutlet. Indeed, angles and bends in a pipe by increasing friction form a\r\nserious obstruction.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of the soil-pipe here indicated, although excellent and\r\nefficient, is susceptible of further improvement by the use of a\r\nventilating cowl or hood at its top. There are many forms of such cowls\r\nin use which are effective whenever there is a sufficient current of\r\nwind; but most of them require a certain force to bring them into\r\naction, and when this force is absent they usually retard the flow they\r\nare intended to increase. This is true of a recent invention known as\r\n\"Banner's ventilating cowl,\" which so long as the wind blows is a most\r\neffective device. When the air is perfectly still, however, it offers by\r\nits curved air-way a certain resistance to the current, and in the case\r\nof baffling winds and flaws the air may blow directly into its opening.\r\n\r\nAmong the various inventions of this sort nothing seems so free from\r\nobjection as the old arrangement known as the \"Emerson\" ventilator,\r\nshown in Figure 7. This gives a straight outlet, protected by a disk far\r\nenough above it not to prevent its delivery of air; and it becomes an\r\neffective suction cowl, with the least movement of the wind from any\r\nside or from above or below. No eddy caused by the angles of gable\r\nroofs can give it a backward draught; and if a pipe armed with it be\r\nheld toward the strongest gale a puff of smoke blown into its other end\r\nwill be instantly drawn through. As the patent for this invention has\r\nrun out, it is competent for any tinsmith to make it, and it is a common\r\narticle of manufacture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--THE EMERSON VENTILATOR.]\r\n\r\n2. What is said above concerning the ventilation of the soil-pipe from\r\nend to end relates to the interest of the private owner. The interest of\r\nthe public gives an equally strong argument in its favor. The sewer\r\nshould be as far as possible removed from the condition of an\r\n\"elongated cesspool.\" There must be no halting of its contents, and no\r\ndeposit of filth or silt at any point. Within the shortest time\r\npossible, every thing received into the sewer must be passed on and\r\ndelivered at its outlet. Still, however perfectly this may be\r\naccomplished, there will always be a certain adhesion of slime to the\r\nwalls of the sewer; and this slime must always be in a state of\r\ndecomposition, a constant source of offence and possible danger. The\r\nonly way to avert this danger is to give the sewer such a thorough\r\nventilation that the decomposition shall be rapid and safe, and that the\r\nresultant gases shall be at once diluted with fresh air.\r\n\r\nThis may be measurably accomplished by the simple ventilation of the\r\nsewer itself, through open-topped man-holes; but such ventilation is\r\nless effective in the case of small sewers than of large ones. In the\r\ncase of either large or small sewers, it will be vastly increased if we\r\ncompel every householder who makes a connection with the sewer, to carry\r\na drain and soil pipe, nowhere less than four inches in diameter, from\r\nthe point of junction with the main line to the open air above the roof.\r\nWhere houses are near enough to make the use of a public sewer\r\nadvisable, the aggregate of these soil-pipes, having almost constantly\r\nan upward current, will make such a draught upon the sewer, to be\r\nsupplied by a downward current through the man-hole covers, as will\r\nmaintain a perfect and continuous ventilation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nImportant as it is to secure the proper arrangement and construction of\r\nsewers and house-drains, it is still more important to provide for the\r\nsafe disposition of the sewage.\r\n\r\nWe must begin at the outset with the understanding that all sewage\r\nmatters not only are of no value to the community, but that it will cost\r\nmoney to get rid of them.\r\n\r\nThere is hardly an instance, after all the efforts that have been made,\r\nof the _profitable_ disposal of the outflow of public sewers. The\r\n_theoretical_ value of the wastes of human life is very great, but the\r\ncost of any method for utilizing them seems at least equally great. The\r\nquestion of cost is so much more important (to the community) than the\r\nquestion of agricultural value, that the practical thing to do is to\r\nmake such disposition as will cost the least, while fully meeting the\r\nbest sanitary requirements.\r\n\r\nSo far as village sewage is concerned, there are three means open for\r\nits disposal: to discharge it into running water or into deep\r\ntide-water, to use it for the surface irrigation of land, or to\r\ndistribute it through sub-irrigation pipes placed at little distance\r\nbelow the surface of the soil. Experiments are being made with more or\r\nless promise of success in the direction of the chemical treatment of\r\nthis liquid so as to purify its effluent water, and retain in a solid\r\nform, and in combination with certain valuable added ingredients, all of\r\nits undissolved impurities. None of these processes can as yet claim\r\nconsideration in regulating public works.\r\n\r\nThe cheapest way to get rid of sewage is to discharge it into a running\r\nstream or into tide-water. So far as the community itself is concerned,\r\nthis is often the best way; but there will very often arise the\r\nobjection that the community has no moral or legal right to foul a\r\nstream of which others make use in its further course. Where the amount\r\nof water constantly flowing is very large, and where the discharge is\r\nrapid,--any given part of the sewage reaching the open air within a few\r\nhours from the time of its entering the pipes,--and where it flows in\r\nmoving water for a considerable distance before reaching others who may\r\nhave occasion to use the stream, no practical danger is to be\r\napprehended. But where the sewage is more foul, more sluggish, or\r\nexposed in the open current for a shorter time, the danger may be\r\nserious. The pouring of sewage into tide-water is always admissible\r\nwhere floats show that there is no danger of a return and deposit of\r\nsolid filth; but the delivery at all stages of the tide, in the\r\nimmediate neighborhood of salt marshes and mud flats, and in land-locked\r\nharbors, is to be avoided.\r\n\r\nWhere an unobjectionable natural outflow cannot be provided, the\r\nirrigation of agricultural lands affords the best relief. The action of\r\nvegetation, the oxidation which takes in the upper and well-aerated\r\nlayers of soil, and the well-known but not yet fully explained\r\ndisinfecting qualities of common earth, are effective in removing the\r\ndangerous and offensive impurities, and in converting them into a more\r\nor less important source of fertility. Precisely how far this system\r\nmay be available during winter, it is not easy to say. While the earth\r\nis locked with frost, there must be very little, if any, infiltration;\r\nbut, as an offset, the action of a low temperature upon the sewage\r\nmatters will clearly be antiseptic; and it is only necessary to provide\r\nagainst an undue washing away of the surface of the ground during thaws,\r\nand against the flowing of the sewage beyond the proper limits.\r\n\r\nGenerally in the neighborhood of villages it will be easy to find lands\r\nover which the delivery may be carried on throughout the year without\r\nobjection. The sewer, or some form of covered channel, should lead far\r\nenough from any public road to avoid offence. From this point it may be\r\nled by open gutters to the land over which it is to be spread,--or\r\nrather through such a system of surface gutters as will enable us to\r\ndeliver it at different parts of the field, according to the\r\nrequirements of the crops, and so as to use fresh land at frequent\r\nintervals, leaving that which has been saturated to the purifying\r\nprocesses of vegetation and atmospheric action.\r\n\r\nThe gutters having been made, it is easy, by the use of portable\r\ndams,--of thin boiler-iron, like broad shovels,--which may be set in\r\nthe course of the flow, to divert the current into any branch channel,\r\nor to stop it at any desired part of this channel. All the gutters\r\nhaving sufficient descent to lead the sewage rapidly forward, it is\r\nusual to set a dam near the far end of the gutter, and allow the sewage\r\nto overflow and run down over the surface until it has reached as far as\r\nthe formation of the ground and the quantity of the liquid will allow it\r\nto spread. This portion having received its due amount of the liquid,\r\nthe dam is moved to a higher point, and the overflow is allowed to\r\nspread over a second area. In this way, step by step, we irrigate all\r\nthat may be reached by a single gutter. Then the moving of the dam in\r\nthe main line turns the water into another gutter, and this is proceeded\r\nwith in like manner. In practice it is found best to begin the overflow\r\nat the farthest end of the lowest-lying gutter, working back step by\r\nstep until the higher parts of the field are reached. It would be better\r\nthat there should be land enough to require the irrigation of any given\r\narea not oftener than once in one or two weeks. The amount required for\r\na given population cannot be determined by any fixed rule,--so much\r\ndepending on the amount of water used _per capita_, and on the\r\nabsorptive character of the irrigated soil. In the case of villages, one\r\nacre to each five hundred of the population would generally be found\r\nample.\r\n\r\nThere are several instances of the successful use of a much smaller area\r\nthan is here indicated, by the use of intermittent downward filtration.\r\nThe most noted success in this direction is that at Merthyr-Tydvil in\r\nWales, a large mining town, where the allowance is only one acre to each\r\ntwo thousand of the population. There are two filter-beds of light loam\r\nover a gravelly subsoil thoroughly underdrained with tiles at a depth of\r\nsix feet. One of these beds is cultivated with some crop like Italian\r\nrye-grass, which bears copious irrigation; and the other by some crop\r\nlike wheat, which, in the absence of irrigation, will thrive on the\r\nfertility left over from the previous season. The volume of sewage is\r\nvery great, but the action of the six feet of earth in removing its\r\nimpurities seems to be complete; the water flowing out from the drains\r\nhaving been proved by analysis to be really far purer than the standard\r\nfixed by the Rivers Pollution Commission.\r\n\r\nIt is an important condition of this system that the sewage, where its\r\nquantity is small, shall be stored in tanks until a large volume has\r\naccumulated, and that it then be rapidly discharged over the soil. There\r\nis no objection to an actual saturation of the ground, provided the soil\r\nis not of such a retentive character as to be liable to become puddled,\r\nand so made impervious. The tanks being emptied, the flow ceases until\r\nthey are again filled. During the interval, the liquid settles away in\r\nthe soil, by which its impurities are removed. Its descent is followed\r\nby the entrance of fresh air, and the oxidizing action of this,\r\naccompanied during the growing season by the purifying effect of the\r\ngrowing crop, leads to an entire decomposition or destruction of all\r\norganic matters.\r\n\r\nThe third system--the distribution of sewage through irrigation-pipes\r\nlaid at a depth of ten or twelve inches below the surface of the\r\nground--has its efficiency attested by numerous instances in private\r\ngrounds. I have adopted this system for disposing of the sewage of the\r\nvillage of Lenox, Mass., where there was no other means available short\r\nof cutting an outlet, at great expense, through a considerable\r\nelevation. This method is an extremely simple one, and is available in\r\nevery instance where even a small area of land lying slightly below the\r\nlevel of the outlet is to be commanded. The arrangement of the\r\nsub-irrigation pipes is easily made: Suppose that in land having an\r\ninclination of about one in two hundred, occupied by grass or other\r\ngrowth, a trench be dug twelve inches deep, that there be laid upon the\r\nbottom of this trench a narrow strip of plank to insure a uniform grade,\r\nand that upon this plank is laid a line of common agricultural\r\nland-drain tiles, say two inches in diameter. However carefully these\r\ntiles may be placed, there will be at their joints a sufficient space\r\nfor the leaking out of any liquid they may contain; the tiles being laid\r\neither with collars around the joints, or with bits of paper laid over\r\nthem, to prevent the rattling in of loose earth during the filling. The\r\nexcavated earth is to be returned to its place, well compacted, and\r\ncovered with its sod. Suppose this drain to have a cross-section equal\r\nto three square inches, and a length of one hundred feet, its capacity\r\nwill equal about sixteen gallons, or a half-barrel. If this amount of\r\nliquid be rapidly discharged into the drain, the inclination being\r\nslight, it will at once be filled or nearly filled for its whole length,\r\nand the liquid will leak away in tolerably uniform proportion at every\r\njoint along the line, and will saturate the surrounding earth. The plan\r\nadopted at Lenox, and recommended for all small villages which cannot\r\nsecure a better outlet, is simply a multiplication of these drains to a\r\nsufficient extent.\r\n\r\nA description of the manner in which the Lenox work is arranged will\r\nillustrate the adaptation of the system to its circumstances. As\r\ncircumstances vary, the adaptation must be modified. (See Figure 8.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--DIAGRAM ILLUSTRATING MANNER OF SEWAGE DISPOSAL\r\nAT LENOX, MASS.]\r\n\r\nThe main outlet sewer delivers at a distance of about one-half mile from\r\nthe last junction with a branch sewer. It is a six-inch pipe five feet\r\nbelow the surface of the ground, and it delivers into a flush-tank like\r\nthat shown in Figure 6, but having a capacity of about five hundred\r\ncubic feet. This tank stands at the upper side of a field having an\r\ninclination of seven in one hundred. There is a branch from the main\r\nsewer, above the tank, supplied with a stop-cock, by which, in case of\r\nneed, the sewage may be carried on down the hill without going into\r\nthe tank. The outlet from the chamber below the siphon leads off in\r\nanother direction down the hill, and has a stop-cock and a branch which\r\nwill allow its flow to be diverted. The discharge of this diverted\r\nstream and the discharge through the branch of the main above the tank,\r\nboth deliver into a horizontal surface gutter to be well grassed, and\r\nlying at the top of the land to be irrigated. By this arrangement,\r\nshould repairs become necessary in the tank, the flow may be turned into\r\nthe gutter; or, should it be desired for any reason to use the outflow\r\nof the tank for surface irrigation, the second branch outlet will\r\ndeliver it into the same gutter, where, the outflow being uniform along\r\nthe whole length of five hundred feet, the stream will pass in a thin\r\nsheet off on to the descending ground. The hill-side, immediately below\r\nthe gutter, is brought to a true grade and covered with grass. As its\r\ninclination is much greater than would be admissible for sub-irrigation\r\ndrains, these are laid _obliquely_ in parallel lines at intervals of six\r\nfeet from one end to the other over the whole graded slope. These drains\r\nare connected at their upper ends with the direct outlet-pipe leading\r\nfrom the siphon chamber. They have an aggregate length of about ten\r\nthousand feet. The method of operation is as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe capacity of the tank is supposed to equal about two days' discharge,\r\nor about thirty-five hundred gallons; and the whole capacity of the\r\ndrains is about half that of the tank, so that the rapid emptying of the\r\nwhole volume into them will insure their being pretty thoroughly filled\r\nfrom end to end. This arrangement will provide for the saturation of the\r\nsoil about once in two days, and will leave a sufficient interval\r\nbetween the periods of saturation for the thorough dispersal and\r\naeration of the filth.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which this system will be interfered with by frost, it is\r\nimpossible to say. This will probably be less than would be supposed,\r\nfor the reason that the ground would often be covered with snow, and\r\nthat the sewage will have sufficient warmth to exert considerable\r\nthawing influence. Whenever the discharge of the liquid through\r\nirrigation pipes is shown to have become obstructed by freezing, it will\r\nonly be necessary to divert the flow, and turn it into the surface\r\ngutter to be distributed over the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that in this case, as in the one which has been under my\r\nobservation for six years past, there will be no interruption of the\r\nworking because of cold; but, should the interruption become serious, I\r\nshall propose the planting of evergreen trees in parallel rows midway\r\nbetween the drains. The protection that would thus be afforded, both by\r\nthe trees and by the drifting snow which they would gather, would\r\nprobably keep the ground free throughout the winter. Incidentally to the\r\nchief advantage of this system, there will be, so long as the land is in\r\ngrass, quite an addition to its product.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are hundreds of villages, with and without a water supply, where\r\nthe houses are too scattering and the street lengths too great to make\r\nit advisable that the cost of any form of public sewerage should be\r\nassumed. In all such villages, the public authority or the active\r\ninfluence of the village improvement association should be exerted to\r\nsecure a regular and systematic adoption of some more perfect system for\r\nthe private disposal of household drainage than is usual. Fortunately,\r\nthe best system is the cheapest.\r\n\r\nNo form of cesspool, no leaching vault, and no cemented tank, should be\r\nallowed under any circumstances. Neither should there be permitted any\r\nform of the old-fashioned out-of-door privy with a vault. Every\r\nhousehold should be supplied with water-closets or well-arranged\r\nearth-closets, to which reference will be made below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--SETTLING BASIN.]\r\n\r\nThe foul water discharge of kitchen sinks, or of whatever form of\r\nslop-sink is used for the water of bedrooms, should discharge into a\r\nflush-tank, and should be led from this by a tightly cemented four-inch\r\ndrain to a tight settling basin in the ground beyond. If water-closets\r\nare used, the soil-pipe should deliver into the drain between the\r\nflush-tank and the settling basin. The settling basin should be\r\nconstructed as shown in Figure 9; and this, as well as the flush-tank,\r\nthe soil-pipe, and the connecting drains, should be amply ventilated.\r\nThe outlet from the settling basin should be carried by well-cemented\r\nvitrified pipes (four-inch) to the connection with the subsoil\r\nirrigation pipes. The flush-tank discharging at each operation of its\r\nsiphon about thirty gallons of liquid, two hundred feet of drain,\r\nunless the soil is very compact, will dispose of the whole discharge\r\nwith sufficient rapidity. The tank being emptied, the flow ceases; and\r\nwithin a very short time the drain becomes empty of its contents, which\r\nare absorbed by the sponge-like action of the earth, and are subjected\r\nto the combined influence of the roots of plants, and of the\r\nconcentrated oxygen contained among the particles of the soil. They will\r\nsoon have their character entirely changed, so that the earth will\r\nbecome purified, and will be ready to receive the next discharge from\r\nthe tank. In the case of my own drains, after five years of unremitted\r\nuse, the gradual accumulation of bits of grease and more solid matters\r\nobstructed the drains, and there appeared undue moisture about their\r\nupper ends. All that was then necessary was to re-open the trenches, and\r\nremove, wash, and replace the tiles. This operation cost, for a length\r\nof two hundred feet, less than three dollars.\r\n\r\nFor any ordinary household of six or eight persons, where the\r\nwater-closet is not used, two hundred feet of drain of this sort will be\r\nsufficient. If there are water-closets, it may be well to duplicate the\r\nlength; and, to provide for the necessary connections to lead the liquid\r\nto the drains, we may assume that in all five hundred feet of length\r\nwill be required. The cost of two-inch tiles at the works, in small\r\nlots, and where collars are furnished, is about three cents per foot;\r\nand we will suppose that transportation will increase the cost to five\r\ncents per foot, making the cost of this item twenty-five dollars. The\r\nstrips of board (three inches wide) will cost, at a very liberal\r\nestimate, five dollars more, and the cost of digging and laying not more\r\nthan another five dollars; so that the establishment of this means of\r\ndisposal, under the most liberal allowance of prices, will not exceed\r\nthirty-five dollars. Ordinarily, especially where neighbors combine to\r\nbuy their material in larger quantities, it will hardly exceed one-half\r\nof this amount. This, be it understood, is for a complete and permanent\r\nsubstitute for the expensive and nasty cesspool now so generally\r\ndepended upon in the country.\r\n\r\nA piece of ground fifty feet square, having ten rows of tile five feet\r\napart and fifty feet long, will suffice for even a large household with\r\nan abundant water supply. For the better illustration of the arrangement\r\nof this system, I give in Figure 10 a plan for the work in the case of a\r\nlot fifty feet wide, with a depth of open ground behind the house of\r\nsomewhat more than fifty feet. The leaching drains may safely begin at a\r\ndistance of even ten feet from the back of the house, requiring for the\r\nwhole a clear area of only fifty feet by sixty feet. With small\r\nhouseholds, the length of drain may be very much shortened. In my own\r\ncase, where water-closets are not used, the total length of irrigation\r\ndrain is, as before stated, only two hundred feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe earth-closet was invented by the Rev. Henry Moule, vicar of\r\nFordington, in England, more than ten years ago. Its progress in England\r\nhas been considerable, and its introduction there has resulted in a\r\nprofit to the company undertaking it. In this country it has met with\r\nless general favor. Two companies with large capital, after expending\r\nall their resources, have been obliged to abandon their attempts to\r\nbuild up a profitable business. Having been actively interested in the\r\nenterprise from its inception, and having given constant attention to\r\nthe merits of the system, I am to-day more than ever convinced that the\r\nsolution of one of the most difficult problems connected with country\r\nand village life is to be sought in its general adoption. The public\r\nreports of sanitary officers in England, who have investigated the\r\nsubject to its foundation, fully confirm every thing that has been\r\nclaimed by the advocates of the earth-closet, unless perhaps in\r\nconnection with the incidental question of the value of the product as a\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nThe only thing which now deters the authorities of some of the larger\r\nmanufacturing towns of the North of England from adopting the\r\ndry-earth-system as a means of relief, under the sharp exaction of the\r\nlaw that prohibits their further fouling of water-courses, is the belief\r\nthat the labor of bringing into the town the enormous amount of earth\r\nrequired to supply such an immense number of closets, and the labor of\r\nremoving the product at frequent intervals, would be so great as to\r\nconstitute an insurmountable obstruction.\r\n\r\nProf. Voelcker, in a paper published in the Journal of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society, shows pretty conclusively that even the use of the\r\nsame earth four or five times over, although perfectly successful in\r\naccomplishing the chief purpose of deodorization, fails to add to it a\r\nsufficient amount of fertilizing matter to make it an available\r\ncommercial manure. Extended experience in small villages and public\r\ninstitutions seems to confirm his view, that, if the earth-closet is to\r\nbe adopted by towns, they cannot depend either on farmers buying the\r\nmanure, or undertaking the labor of supplying and removing it. It is\r\nestimated, that, for a population of one hundred thousand persons, there\r\nwould be required seventy-five tons of earth per day, to say nothing of\r\nheavy refuse matters which would be thrown into the closets, and would\r\nincrease the amount to be removed. Even the quantity required for a\r\nvillage of a few hundred inhabitants, if it were to be brought in and\r\ncarried out, would entail a considerable cost for handling.\r\n\r\nI have recently concluded an experiment of six years' duration, the\r\nresult of which seems to show that this objection to the adoption of the\r\nearth-closet system may be set aside, or at least reduced to such\r\nproportions as to make it unimportant. In the autumn of 1870 I had\r\nbrought to my house, where only earth-closets are used, two small\r\ncart-loads of garden earth, dried and sifted. This was used repeatedly\r\nin the closets; and, when an increased quantity was required, additions\r\nwere made of sifted anthracite ashes. I estimate that the amount of\r\nmaterial now on hand is about two tons. We long since stopped adding to\r\nthe quantity, finding that the amount was ample to furnish a supply of\r\ndry and decomposed material whenever it becomes necessary to refill the\r\nreservoirs of the closets.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation under the seats is discharged through simply arranged\r\nvalves into bricked vaults in the cellar. When these vaults become\r\nfilled,--about three times in a year,--their contents, which are all\r\nthoroughly decomposed, are piled up in a dry and ventilated place with a\r\nslight covering of fresh earth to keep down any odor that might arise.\r\nAfter a sufficient interval these heaps are ready for further use,\r\nthere being no trace, in any portion, of foreign matter nor any\r\nappearance or odor differing from that of an unused fresh mixture of\r\nearth and ashes. In this way the material has been used over and over\r\nagain, at least ten times; and there is no indication to the senses of\r\nany change in its condition.\r\n\r\nA sample of this material has recently been analyzed by Prof. Atwater,\r\nat the Connecticut Agricultural Station at Middletown. The analysis\r\nshows that it contains no more organic matter than Prof. Voelcker found\r\nin fresh earth prepared for use in the closet,--say about two hundred\r\npounds,--nearly all of which organic matter it undoubtedly contained\r\nwhen first made ready for use. In my case, there was an addition, at a\r\nmoderate calculation of at least, 800 pounds of solid dry matter during\r\nthe six years' use by an average of four adult persons. Prof. Voelcker's\r\nanalysis showed that the unused earth contained about twelve pounds of\r\nnitrogen. Prof. Atwater's analysis shows that my two tons contained only\r\nabout eleven pounds of nitrogen. By calculation, the 800 pounds of solid\r\ndry matters added in the use of my material contained 230 pounds of\r\nnitrogen.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the constitution of Prof. Voelcker's sample was somewhat\r\ndifferent from the original constitution of my own; but practically,\r\nexcept perhaps for the addition of a trifling amount of residual carbon\r\nremaining after the decomposition, they were about the same; and, after\r\nbeing used ten times over, the whole of the 800 pounds of organic matter\r\nadded, including 230 pounds of nitrogen, seem to have entirely\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nIt becomes interesting and important to know what has become of this\r\nadded matter. That it was absorbed into the particles of the earth, is a\r\nmatter of course; and the result proves that after such absorption it\r\nwas subjected to such a chemical action of the concentrated oxygen\r\nalways existing in porous dry material as led to its entire destruction.\r\nPorous substances condense gases--air, oxygen, etc.--in proportion to\r\nthe extent of their interior surface. The well-known disinfecting action\r\nof charcoal--the surface of the interior particles of which equal from\r\nfifty to one hundred square feet to each cubic inch of material, and all\r\nof which surface is active in condensing oxygen--is due not simply to\r\nan absorption of foul-smelling odors, but to an actual destruction of\r\nthem by slow combustion, so that the same mass of charcoal, if kept dry\r\nand porous, will continue almost indefinitely its undiminished\r\ndisinfecting action.\r\n\r\nThe earth used in the closet is a porous material, sufficiently dry for\r\nthe free admission of air or of oxygen. The foulest materials when\r\ncovered with dry earth at once lose their odor, and are in time as\r\neffectively destroyed by combustion (oxidized) as though they had been\r\nburned in a furnace. The process is more slow, but none the less sure;\r\nand it is clear that in the case of my dirt-heap the foul matters added\r\nhave thus been destroyed. The practical bearings of this fact are of the\r\nutmost importance. Earth is not to be regarded as a vehicle for the\r\ninoffensive removal beyond the limits of the town of what has hitherto\r\nbeen its most troublesome product, but as a medium for bringing together\r\nthe offensive ingredients of this product, and the world's great\r\nscavenger, oxygen. My experiment seems to demonstrate the fact that\r\nthere is no occasion to carry away the product from the place where it\r\nhas been produced, as after a reasonable time it has ceased to exist,\r\nand there remains only a mass of earth which is in all respects as\r\neffective as any fresh supply that could be substituted.\r\n\r\nThe quantity necessary to be provided can be determined only by extended\r\ntrial. My experiment proves that the amount needed does not exceed one\r\nthousand pounds for each member of the household, and that this amount\r\nonce provided will remain permanently effective to accomplish its\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWith a suitable public supply of water for the purpose, and with a\r\nsuitable means of disposal, nothing can be better and nothing is more\r\neasily kept in good condition than well-regulated and properly\r\nventilated water-closets. Where these are available, with enough water\r\nfor their flushing, their use is to be recommended. Where there is not\r\nsufficient water, there a well-regulated system of earth-closets seems\r\nto be imperatively demanded. By one process or the other we must prevent\r\nthe fouling of the lower soil, and the consequent tainting of wells and\r\nsprings, and the ground under houses and adjoining their cellars. With\r\na system of sub-irrigation pipes which deliver foul matters into earth\r\nthat is subject to the active operation of oxidizing influences, we need\r\nfear no contamination of the deep and unaerated soil. It would be\r\nbetter, however, where this system is used for the disposal of the\r\noutflow of soil-pipes, to avoid the use of wells. As a general rule, it\r\nis safer not to use for drinking purposes the water of any well near a\r\nhouse or a stable: practically, it is better not to use wells at all as\r\na source of water for domestic supply. Filtered cistern-water is greatly\r\nto be preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARM VILLAGES.\r\n\r\n     \"God made the country, and man made the town.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCowper's view of the charm of country life as compared with life in the\r\ntown is a very natural one. The same view suggests itself to every\r\ncultivated denizen of the city who finds himself in the country on a\r\nbeautiful June morning, or under a warm September sun, or during the\r\ntime of brilliant autumn foliage, or when the sun sets with a warm glow,\r\ngilding the clean, bare boughs of November trees, or when the whole\r\ncountryside is covered with spotless snow, or when grass and leaves and\r\nbuds and birds first feel the awakening warmth of spring. The scene is\r\nfull of a charm and a novelty which appeal to him most strongly; and he\r\nbelieves, for the moment at least, that nothing could make him so\r\nentirely happy as to spend his life away from the noise and confusion\r\nof the town, and amid such scenes of rural peace and beauty. Filled with\r\nthis enthusiasm, one builds with reference to a magnificent view, and\r\nwithout regard to the practical inconveniences of the site, fancying\r\nthat true happiness requires only a continuance of the novel charms\r\nwhich have enraptured him.\r\n\r\nThe cultivated countryman, too,--one who has learned to use his eyes,\r\nand to see what nature has to offer him,--appreciates even more\r\nthoroughly, if not so keenly, the never-ending and ever-changing\r\ninterest by which he is surrounded. His admiration and enthusiasm,\r\nhowever, are tempered by familiarity with some disadvantages of country\r\nlife,--just as the romantic house-builder finds on closer acquaintance\r\nthat, magnificent though a hill-top view may be, a hill-top residence is\r\nnot without its grave drawbacks, nor free from annoyances and practical\r\nobjections which too often throw a veil over the most majestic outlook.\r\n\r\nA blue-sided, white-capped mountain, reflected in a broad, placid,\r\nshimmering lake, and framed between fleeting clouds, graceful trees, and\r\nverdant lawn, is beyond compare the strongest inducement and the best\r\nreward one can offer to a visiting friend; but vile roads, distant\r\nneighbors, discontented and transitory servants, and all the thousand\r\nand one obstructions to the machinery of domestic life, soon blind the\r\neye of the unhappy householder to the beauty which lies ever before him,\r\nuntil at last the one great good thing which commands his constant\r\nthought is that romantic and pecunious friend who shall come some happy\r\nday to purchase his estate.\r\n\r\nThere is another class, and a very large one, whose opinion concerning\r\nthe godlike character of the country it is our especial purpose to\r\nconsider here. The farmer and the farmer's family may or may not be\r\ncultivated persons. Cultivation does not come by nature; and the\r\nincessant and increasing duties of farm life leave one, however well\r\ndisposed, but little time and but scant strength for aesthetic study. The\r\nfarmhouse is the centre of the home life and of the homely thought and\r\nfeeling of its inmates. The farm on which one has been born and bred is\r\nthe centre and standpoint from which he regards the world without. All\r\nthose more tender emotions which are common to our nature, and which\r\nattach themselves to the home, find their development on the farm as\r\nwell as in the town. Sentimentally considered, it matters little whether\r\nthe object of these emotions be on the farm, in the wilderness, in the\r\nvillage, or in the city. Fortunately, man is by no means a creature of\r\nemotion alone; and the satisfaction and good of living are less a matter\r\nof feeling than of activity, industry, and intelligence. The place in\r\nwhich one lives is more or less satisfactory in proportion as it\r\nfacilitates and encourages the better and more useful living.\r\n\r\nJust as the citizen feels the attractions of the country, which are so\r\nnovel to his town-bred taste, so the countryman finds a charm in the\r\nnovelty of the town. As one is led toward the quiet and solitude of the\r\nfields and woods, so the other is drawn by the life and interest of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, at least in America, where the facilities for pleasant\r\ncountry living are far less than in England, the countryman who goes to\r\ntown is less likely to wish himself back on the farm than is the\r\ntown-bred farmer to long for the comforts and conveniences of his former\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\"Man is a social animal,\" and the aphorism is especially true of his\r\nwife and daughter. As the lives of the wife and daughter are much more\r\nconfined to the immediate surroundings of the domicile than is that of\r\nthe man himself, so the question as between town and country should be\r\nconsidered more especially with reference to them.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain amount of truth on both sides of every question; and\r\nthe one which we are now considering is not to be answered by a decision\r\nin favor of the heart of a great city, or of the entire solitude of an\r\noutlying farm. As is so often the case, its solution lies between the\r\ntwo extremes. If one may be permitted to imagine the conditions best\r\nsuited to the perfect physical, intellectual, and social development of\r\nthe human being, one would naturally think of a small town or a large\r\nvillage where society is sufficient, where the facilities for\r\ninstruction are good, where communication with the large centres is\r\neasy, where the conveniences and facilities for household economy are\r\ncomplete, and where the country with its beauty and quiet and freshness\r\nis close at hand,--where one feels on this side the influence of a\r\ncomplete social organization, and on that the sweet breath of mother\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, these imaginings can never be freed from the practical\r\nbearing of the bread-winning and money-making interests. Men must live,\r\nnot where they prefer to live, but where their interests compel them to\r\nlive. The town and the country have their mutual economic duties by\r\nwhich their life must be controlled. All that we can hope to do is, on\r\none hand, to ameliorate the hardness and solitude of country living,\r\nand, on the other, to bring the citizen into nearer relation with the\r\ninvigorating fields and woods and boundless air of the country.\r\n\r\nDevising no modern Sybaris, where all possible good of life may follow\r\nfrom the unaided operation of a perfect social and industrial\r\norganization, I propose to confine myself to the simple question of the\r\nbest practical development of village life for farmers. The village or\r\nits immediate vicinity seems to me to offer the urbanist the nearest\r\napproach to the country that is available for his purposes; and in like\r\nmanner village life, so far as it can be made to fit his conditions,\r\noffers to the farmer as much of the benefit of town life as the needs of\r\nhis work will allow him to obtain. If those who now seek the pleasures\r\nof retirement in costly and soul-wearying country-seats would congregate\r\ninto spacious and well-kept villages, and if those who now live in the\r\nsolitary retirement of the mud-bound farmhouse would congregate into\r\nvillages, we should secure far more relief from the confinement of the\r\ntown and a wider-reaching attractiveness in agricultural life; this\r\nlatter leading to the improvement of our farming by a solution of that\r\nlong-mooted problem, \"How to keep the boys on the farm.\"\r\n\r\nNearly everywhere on the Continent of Europe those who are engaged in\r\nthe cultivation of the land live in villages. An observation of the\r\nmodes of life and industry of these villages has led me to consider\r\nwhether some similar system might not tend to the improvement of the\r\nconditions of our own farmers, and to the amelioration of some hardships\r\nto which their families are subjected.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, as here, the methods of living have grown from natural\r\ncauses. There it was a necessary condition of agricultural industry,\r\nthat those who tilled the soil should be protected by the military\r\npower of their lord or chief; and their houses were clustered under the\r\nshadow of his castle wall. The castles have crumbled away, and the\r\nprotecting arm of the old baron has been replaced by the protecting arm\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\nThe community of living, which grew from necessity, having proved its\r\nfitness by long trial, is still maintained; but there seems to have been\r\nno general tendency toward the formation of such little communities\r\nhere. Save in a few exceptional cases,--as in the old villages of the\r\nConnecticut Valley, where protection against Indians or safety from\r\ninundation compelled the original settlers to gather into\r\ncommunities,--the pioneer built his cabin in his new clearing, and, as\r\nhis circumstances improved, changed his cabin for a house, and his small\r\nhouse for a larger one, and finally established his comfortable home in\r\nconnection with his fertile fields. This method has been adopted\r\nthroughout the whole country; and the peculiarly American system of\r\nisolated farm-life has become almost universal throughout the length and\r\nbreadth of the land.\r\n\r\nI am not so enthusiastic as to believe that a radical change from this\r\nuniversal system is to be hoped for at any early day; but I believe that\r\nit is worth while for farmers to consider how far they may, without\r\npermanent harm to the interests for which they are working, secure for\r\nthemselves, and especially for their families, the benefits of village\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nTo this end are adduced the following examples, both of which are of\r\ncourse purely imaginary. The first has reference to a new settlement of\r\nwild land, where, by the Government's system of division, the boundaries\r\nare rectangular, and where the political subdivisions are of uniform\r\nmeasurement. The second relates to the necessary change of conditions\r\nnow existing in the longer-settled parts of the country.\r\n\r\nFor this latter, the illustration is taken from an actual accurate\r\nsurvey[1] of a purely agricultural district in Rhode Island, showing the\r\nroads, houses, and field boundaries as they now exist, followed by a\r\nsuggestion as to the manner in which the same division of estates might\r\nbe made to conform to the assembling of their owners into a village.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A map of the United States Coast Survey.]\r\n\r\nThe Government division is into townships six miles square. It is\r\nproposed to divide each township into nine settlements, giving to each a\r\nsquare of two miles, or 2,560 acres. Each of these settlements should\r\nhave its whole population concentrated in a village at its centre. A\r\nsuitable method of division would be that indicated in Figure 11, where\r\na public road crosses the middle of the tract north and south, and east\r\nand west. The outside of the tract, for the width of half a mile all\r\naround, is laid off in farms of 80 acres and 160 acres. These are\r\nbounded on the inner sides by a road. Inside of this road again is a\r\nseries of smaller farms (40 acres), and inside of these a tier of still\r\nsmaller places (10 acres), separated from the central village by a\r\nnarrow road. The village itself occupies 40 acres.\r\n\r\nThe division of the agricultural land is as follows:--\r\n\r\n    4 farms of   160 acres   640\r\n   16     \"       80   \"   1,280\r\n   12     \"       40   \"     480\r\n   12     \"       10   \"     120\r\n\r\nin all, 44 tracts, aggregating 2,520 acres, and averaging nearly 60\r\nacres each, the most distant being less than a mile from the village\r\ngreen. This division is arbitrary; in practice, the more industrious\r\nmembers of the community would buy land from their less industrious\r\nneighbors, and the size and arrangement of the farms would vary. Often,\r\ntoo, the division would be into farms averaging more than sixty acres.\r\nIn such cases there would usually be about the same population, as the\r\nlarger holders would employ more workmen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--DIVISION OF FOUR SQUARE MILES WITH CENTRAL\r\nVILLAGE.]\r\n\r\nWhat is attempted is chiefly to show how four square miles of land may\r\nbe so divided that its occupiers may be conveniently gathered into a\r\nvillage; and it may fairly be assumed, that, except in the more remote\r\ngrazing and grain-growing regions, the population (including laborers)\r\nwould generally be about one household for each sixty acres. In the more\r\nthickly settled regions, this limit is exceeded now; and, as population\r\nincreases, this condition will extend. In any case, the principle\r\nadvanced remains the same, whether there be thirty households or sixty.\r\n\r\nA suitable division of the village is shown in Figure 12. Its centre is\r\noccupied by a public square at the intersection of the main roads. The\r\nroad surrounds a piece of ornamental ground, containing about one acre.\r\nNorth and south of the square are the sites of two churches, a\r\nschoolhouse, and a store and public house. This is again arbitrary; the\r\npurpose is to have these spaces occupied by somewhat important\r\nbuildings, which it will not be necessary to enclose by fences, so that\r\nan appearance of more size may be given to the central feature of the\r\nvillage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--DIVISION OF THE CENTRAL VILLAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe spaces set apart for these buildings, as well as the village green,\r\nshould be surrounded by regularly planted trees, such as will grow to a\r\nlarge size, like the American elm. But the whole open space should\r\nremain otherwise free from planting. Smooth, well-kept grass, and large\r\ntrees planted in formal lines, with an entire absence of fences, posts,\r\nchains, bushes, and all decorations, will give a dignity and character\r\nwhich an excess of ornamentation would spoil. A certain amount of\r\njudicious bedding would be permissible, but it would be best that even\r\nthis should be confined to private places. Any fund available for\r\nembellishing the village green will be best used in keeping its grass\r\ncut and its walks clean,--entire neatness and simplicity being its most\r\neffective characteristics.\r\n\r\nOn the streets leading east and west from the green there are shown\r\nsixteen lots 100 X 250 (one-half acre), eight 50 X 250 (one-quarter\r\nacre). These lots all open on narrow lanes at the rear. On the streets\r\nleading north and south there are twelve lots 50 X 650 (three-quarters\r\nacre), and eight lots 100 X 650 (one and one-half acres). These are the\r\nvillage lots proper, but the twelve ten-acre tracts which front on its\r\nsurrounding street would be the residences of their owners; and these\r\nsemi-detached houses--the most distant not a quarter of a mile from the\r\ngreen--would form a part of the village, and come within the operation\r\nof its rules of association. Probably the blacksmith, the wheelwright,\r\nand the builder would occupy these outlying places, with an \"annex\" of\r\nfarming to supplement their trades.\r\n\r\nThe village lots proper are all large enough for a kitchen-garden, barn,\r\nbarn-yard, &c.; and all have means of access from the rear, so that\r\ntheir street fronts may be kept for ornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nIt would be a good rule that no house should stand nearer to the street\r\nline than thirty feet, and that no fence should be made nearer to the\r\nstreet than sixty feet. This would add very much to the largeness of\r\nappearance of the whole village; would decorate every street with the\r\nornamental fronts of the houses and with their plants and shrubbery, and\r\nwould, at the same time, shut off from the ornamental parts every thing\r\nbelonging to the working department of the village life. Even the baker\r\nand the shoemaker should conform to this rule, and their shops should be\r\nmade to help the neatness of appearance of the village.\r\n\r\nThe larger farmers, having the most cattle, would occupy the largest\r\nlots, which would readily accommodate their larger needs. The more\r\nambitious of them would probably buy land, for night pasture or for\r\ncultivation, from a ten-acre neighbor opposite their rear line.\r\n\r\nThe village population would be somewhat as follows: two clergymen, one\r\ndoctor, one teacher, one baker, one shoemaker, one tailor, two\r\nstore-keepers, one carpenter, one wheelwright, one blacksmith, one\r\ndressmaker, one innkeeper, forty-four farmers: total, fifty-eight heads\r\nof families. Probably, including hired laborers and servants, the\r\naverage would be six persons to each household. This would make the\r\npopulation of the village about 350. No part of the whole scheme is more\r\narbitrary than this arrangement of its human element; and no part of it\r\nwould be more modified in different cases by the element of human\r\nnature. Still, this sketch of the industrial division of the community\r\nwould probably be approximated in any purely agricultural village of\r\nthis size,--with such changes in the detail as would come from\r\nindividual enterprise or indolence.\r\n\r\nTaking the whole area at 2,560 acres, and the population at 350\r\npersons, we have an area of about 7-1/3 acres to furnish the support and\r\nhome of each member of the community,--an amount ample for the purpose.\r\n\r\nFigure 13 suggests the arrangement of the central open space of the\r\nvillage,--all of which should be in well-kept grass, except where roads\r\nand paths are needed. Paths should be reduced to the least amount that\r\nwill furnish the necessary accommodation, and they should be kept in\r\nneat condition. If no provision can be made for this, it will be better\r\nto leave the people to beat their own tracks across the grass as their\r\nneeds direct. These beaten foot-paths are never unsightly (in small\r\nvillages), for the reason that they are never large, and that they are\r\nonly of such width as their regular use will keep clean: the grass\r\nmaintains its effort to spread, and grows always close up to the\r\nnecessary foot-way. Even in Hyde Park (London), where the people have\r\nmade short cuts across the broad lawns, the paths thus marked out, and\r\nreceiving no attention, are not only unobjectionable, but are a charming\r\nfeature of that beautiful pleasure-ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--DIVISION OF THE CENTRAL OPEN SPACE OF THE\r\nVILLAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe foot-path indicated for the village green will be demanded by the\r\nmore ambitious village improvers; but were I making an ideal village for\r\nmoderate and tasteful people, the road surrounding the green should\r\nenclose only a level, close-cropped lawn, neatly trimmed at its edges,\r\nsurrounded by fine and simple trees, and traced here and there with the\r\nfoot-paths that honest use had marked out and made, and by the\r\nsuggestive diamond-shaped track and bases of the village base-ball club.\r\nIt should be perfect in grade, in outline, in regularity of planting,\r\nand in mowing; but it should be a perfect lawn _plus_ the wear of\r\nconstant use and frequent pleasure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe second example is taken from existing conditions in my own\r\nneighborhood. The United States Coast Survey has furnished all the\r\nnecessary details save the _farm_ boundaries. The field boundaries and\r\nroads are exact.\r\n\r\nThe tract is of the same size with the one just considered,--two miles\r\nsquare. Its centre is in one direction about two miles from a small\r\nvillage, and in the other about seven miles from a large town which\r\nfurnishes the chief market for its agricultural products, and is the\r\nsource of all (or nearly all) of its supplies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--PRESENT DIVISION AND SETTLEMENT OF TRACT IN\r\nRHODE ISLAND, TWO MILES SQUARE.]\r\n\r\nFigure 14 shows the present settlement of this area, the houses, about\r\nsixty in number, being scattered over the whole tract, with no near\r\napproach to a \"neighborhood\" at any point. These are practically all\r\nfarmers' houses, some trade being carried on here and there in\r\nconnection with the farm-work. A few of the houses belong to farms\r\nwhich lie mainly outside of my lines. Deducting a fair proportion for\r\nthis, and others for the wheelwright, blacksmith, &c., we shall have\r\nabout the same number of farmers as in the former instance, say\r\nforty-four; and, taking the same area for the village, we shall have the\r\nsame amount of farm and village property for their support.\r\n\r\nFigure 15 shows a suitable division of property and the location of the\r\nvillage, on a short cross street running from one to the other of the\r\nmain public roads, and extending a short distance up and down these\r\nroads.\r\n\r\nIt would be a necessary condition precedent, that the whole property\r\ntaken for the village should be set apart for the purpose. This\r\nrequirement and the cost of moving buildings from the farms to the\r\nvillage would doubtless be an serious obstacle to the immediate carrying\r\nout of the plan. And thus the theory must long remain a theory only. No\r\nsudden change of the sort could be made in practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--THE RHODE ISLAND TRACT, WITH ITS BUILDINGS\r\nGATHERED INTO A COMPACT VILLAGE.]\r\n\r\nIt would not be impossible, however, to bring about the end in time, if\r\na few of the larger proprietors could secure possession of the village\r\ntract by exchange, and would dedicate it to the purpose, agreeing at any\r\nfuture time to sell small lots for building at a fixed low rate. In the\r\ninstance under consideration, the village tract is thinly settled, and\r\nso situated as to be available at moderate cost. If a church, a\r\nschoolhouse, and a store could be established as a nucleus of the\r\nvillage, the young couples of the neighborhood might incline to settle\r\nthere; and in time the settlement could be made so attractive--as\r\ncompared with the outlying farmhouses--as to lead to the concentration\r\nof the whole population.\r\n\r\nThis part of the subject is, however, foreign to the present purpose. If\r\nthe _desirability_ of village life for farmers can be established, the\r\nways and means may safely be left to those interested in securing it.\r\nThe influences now at work to make the farmers' children seek a better\r\nsocial condition, together with the necessity which confines them to\r\nsome form of agricultural work, must be depended on to secure the relief\r\nsuggested, unless some better relief can be found.\r\n\r\nIn this case, as in every other of village construction, the original\r\nplan should include some quality or feature, which, while appropriate to\r\nthe modest end in view, will give character to the place.\r\n\r\nEvery village has in its situation, its uses, or its origin, some\r\ncharacteristic which may be developed into a leading and an attractive\r\nfeature. Especially when the work is to be begun from the foundation,\r\nand when there are no buildings to be torn down or removed, a consistent\r\nand dignified result may be planned for at the outset.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic feature of the village we are now considering is that\r\nit is to consist of a single long, straight street cut off at each end\r\nby other roads. After removing one unimportant house, there remains no\r\nobstacle to the laying-out of one straight street two hundred feet wide,\r\nwith either two or four rows of spreading elms. This street, two\r\nthousand feet long, mainly in well-kept grass, with only the necessary\r\nwidth of road and the requisite paths,--having perhaps a well-kept and\r\nhome-like private place opposite each of its ends,--would stamp the\r\nvillage at once with an attraction which would have a constant\r\ncivilizing effect on those living under its influence.\r\n\r\nSuch a village street, entirely without costly ornamentation, and\r\nrequiring only the simplest care, would soon take on a look of\r\nappropriate neatness and freshness; and, as the trees grew, it would\r\nacquire a dignity and beauty which could in no other way be so well\r\nsecured.\r\n\r\nThe church and the schoolhouse, being placed in broad recesses opposite\r\nthe central point of the street, would gain importance from their\r\nposition; and, these main features being attended to, the _character_ of\r\nthe village would be fixed, and it would be difficult to make any\r\narrangement of its private places which would spoil its beauty. Neatness\r\nand a reasonable care in the matter of house-gardening, the planting of\r\nflower-beds, vines, etc., are all that would be needed.\r\n\r\nWith so wide a street, it would be as well to bring all house-fronts to\r\nthe street line, completing this line with simple fences, and paying\r\nsome attention to the ornamentation of the enclosed yards.\r\n\r\nIn this village, as in the other, all meretricious ornamentation should\r\nbe avoided, whether public or private. All money available for such\r\nimprovement should be spent in securing perfect neatness. In fact, the\r\ntwo radical requirements of good taste in all such cases are an absence\r\nof obvious money-spending, and the evidence of constant care and\r\nattention. \"Showiness\" is common in every trumpery village in the land.\r\nWhat we should seek in our farm-villages is the most modest simplicity,\r\nshining with the polish of an affectionate care. Every spot should\r\nbreathe of homely influences and moral peacefulness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--PROPOSED ARRANGEMENT OF THE RHODE ISLAND FARM\r\nVILLAGE.]\r\n\r\nFigure 16 shows the general plan of the village. If other public\r\nbuildings are needed, they might very well be placed opposite the ends\r\nof the main street.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, in remodelling an old farming district, where\r\nboundaries and roads are irregular, to apportion the division of land\r\namong the population with especial reference to its distance from the\r\nvillage; so, for example, that the small farmers, who have little\r\nteam-force, shall not have so far to go as the larger ones who are\r\nbetter equipped; but, even in this case, the most distant farm will be\r\nrarely a mile from the village, where all the farmers, their families,\r\nand their work-people, and their flocks and herds, would be gathered\r\ntogether, under the best circumstances for getting out of their lives as\r\nmuch good as the need for earning a living by arduous work will allow\r\nthem to get anywhere,--more than they could hope to get in the isolation\r\nof the distant farmhouse.\r\n\r\nHaving now considered the methods by which farmers may congregate their\r\nhomes and their farm-buildings, and live in villages, let us take up\r\nthe more important question of policy.\r\n\r\nWhich would be better for a young man, just starting in life with a\r\nyoung wife,--to go to a distant farmhouse to found his home, or to\r\nsettle in a well-ordered farm-village under substantially the conditions\r\ndescribed above?\r\n\r\nThere is much more to be said, on both sides of this question, than\r\nthere is room to say here; but certain points are worthy of\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that in a strictly money-making aspect there is an\r\nadvantage in having the animals on the land from which they are fed, and\r\nthe men on the farm which they are to work. It is certain, also, that\r\nthe men and the women must be near the stables, that the early and late\r\nwork of feeding and milking may be promptly and regularly performed. If\r\nthe family is to live in the village, the cattle must live in the\r\nvillage too. This involves the hauling home of all the hay and grain,\r\nand the hauling out again of all manure,--no slight task. If the work is\r\nall concentrated on the farm, under the immediate supervision of the\r\nfarmer, there will be a certain convenience and economy of time.\r\n\r\nThe same principle holds true in all other relations. The merchant would\r\nfind a certain advantage in living at his warehouse, the engine-builder\r\nat his factory, the cotton-spinner at his mill, the carpenter at his\r\nshop, and the grocer at his store. All of these have found that, so far\r\nas may be, they get certain other and greater advantages in living away\r\nfrom their business. One and all carry to their homes, at least\r\noccasionally, books, papers, and plans for work that needs attention out\r\nof the regular business hours.\r\n\r\nThe farmer alone--and in this country especially--disregards the\r\nbenefits of living away from his shop, and passes his whole life--day\r\nand night--in close contact with his field of operations. He might, if\r\nhe chose, make his home nearer to other homes, taking with him so much\r\nof his work as is not necessarily confined to the farm.\r\n\r\nFor his own sake, it does not make so much difference; but for the sake\r\nof his wife and children it makes all the difference between life and\r\nstagnation. The business needs which call him to town, and the habit he\r\nhas of passing his evenings at \"the store,\" give him a certain\r\namount--and a certain kind--of social intercourse which keeps him from\r\nabsolute rust. The amount of society available for his family is not\r\nusually great, and the dulness and confinement of farmhouse life need no\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for preferring village life is principally because it is\r\nbetter for the women and children; but there are reasons, in the same\r\ndirection, why better social conditions would give the farmer himself\r\ndecided benefits. The life, too, would be more _attractive_ for both\r\nboys and girls, and would be divested of that naked and dismal gloom and\r\ndryness which now drive so much of the best farmer blood of the whole\r\ncountry to work-benches and counters,--to any position, in fact, which\r\npromises relief from the stifling isolation of the country.\r\n\r\nWhile conceding that, just as a cabinet-maker would make more money if\r\nhe lived in his back shop, and had little thought from early dawn until\r\nlate evening except for his work, so the farmer may make more money if\r\nhe lives on his farm than if he lives at a distance, still it must be\r\nsaid that the difference in profit is by no means so great as would be\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nIt may be fairly assumed, that, at least in the more thickly settled\r\nfarming regions at the East, the average distance at which farmers live\r\nfrom the nearest centre of population that supplies their \"shopping,\"\r\nand from church, is not less than three miles. The visiting acquaintance\r\nof the family is nearly or quite as remote; and there is, altogether, so\r\nmuch driving to be done, as to make it necessary to keep a decent\r\ncarriage and horses, and to supply a certain amount of extra horse\r\nservice. Indeed, among those who are tolerably well off it would be\r\nmoderate to set down the total services of one good horse as needed to\r\nsupply the family's demand for transportation.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the need of the farmer himself to go to town to sell and to\r\nbuy, to get repairs and information, and (a much more generally\r\ngratified taste than he would always care to confess to his wife) to\r\nsatisfy his craving after intercourse with his kind,--who shall estimate\r\nthe aggregate of all this travel, or even of that part of it which,\r\nunder the pretext of business, is really only an habitual going for\r\ngossip? All of this driving is confined to no season; it is\r\nperennial,--in good weather and in bad,--and it costs an amount of time\r\nand money that few farmers would like to put down in black and white,\r\nand charge to their expense accounts. It would form one of the most\r\nserious items of their budget.\r\n\r\nDid the farmer live in a pleasant and attractive village, among\r\nneighbors and friends, nearly all of this driving would be saved. The\r\nappliances for the family's pleasure-driving might be entirely done away\r\nwith, for the wife and daughters would gladly exchange the means for\r\noccasional visiting and for distant shopping, for an agreeable circle of\r\nfriends near at hand and a good village store and post-office within\r\nfive minutes' walk. In such a settlement as is contemplated, most of the\r\nbusiness needs of the farmer would be amply supplied, and he would find\r\nthe companionship at hand even more satisfactory, because more familiar,\r\nthan that which he now finds in the town.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while to calculate the cash saving that would come of\r\nthis reduction of road-*work. It is enough to consider it as an\r\nimportant offset to the cost of carrying men and manure to the field and\r\nof bringing crops to the village.\r\n\r\nUnder the present system the women have the worst of it. They have the\r\nconfinement and seclusion and dulness. Under the village system the men\r\nwould have the discomfort, and this is why it will be less easy to\r\nsecure its adoption; for the men control, and prefer _not_ to have the\r\nheavy end of life's log to carry.\r\n\r\nUnder either of the plans given herewith, the greatest--not the\r\naverage--distance from the house to the farm would be about one mile,\r\nand it would have to be travelled only during the working weather of the\r\nwarmer months, and during the good wheeling of winter. In summer, all\r\nhands would have to set off early, and come home late, often carrying\r\ntheir dinner with them as mechanics do; but when field-work did not call\r\nthem out, as during rains, or when the ground is too wet to be\r\ndisturbed, their barn-work and shop-work would be at home; and, all the\r\nwinter through, the only road-work to be done would be to send the teams\r\nto haul out the manure, and to bring home the hay, which would be best\r\nstored under \"Dutch hay-barracks\" in the fields when it was made. This\r\nwork would be systematic and simple; and it may fairly be questioned\r\nwhether it would not, in many cases, amount to _less_ than the cost of\r\nthe \"driving\" that is now done, and which in the village might be\r\nforegone. Especially would this be the case when all the heavy farm-work\r\nis done by oxen, which when idle, instead of eating their heads off like\r\nhorses, are accumulating valuable flesh. With sufficient ox-power to do\r\nthe work easily, the whole transportation of tools and men, and all the\r\nhay-tedding and hay-raking, would be easily done by one horse, with\r\nleeway enough to allow for a fair amount of business or pleasure travel.\r\n\r\nSo far as the presence of the farmer himself is concerned, it is to be\r\nconsidered that if his farm and cattle are near his house in the\r\nvillage, he will be within easy reach of them very often at times when\r\nhis visits to the distant town would take him away from them if they\r\nwere on the farm. In the village, during the whole winter, and in bad\r\nweather at other seasons, he would have little necessity or temptation\r\nto absent himself from home. Indeed, those who have had an opportunity\r\nto watch the life of the exceptional farmers whose houses and barns and\r\nstables are in a village cannot have failed to notice how much more\r\nhome-like and engaging is the whole farm establishment than it usually\r\nis in the country. It is hardly too much to say that the few instances\r\nthat we have, as in the farm-villages of New England, show that these\r\nvillage-living farmers are apparently more attentive to their home\r\nduties than are their isolated brethren, at least in the matter of\r\ntidiness.\r\n\r\nTo complete the comparison with the merchant or manufacturer, who takes\r\nhis papers or plans home with him for work out of regular hours, one\r\nmight say that the farmer who lives at a distance from his land, with\r\nhis flocks and herds gathered about his homestead, has such of his work\r\nas needs early and late attention close at hand, while his regular\r\nworkshop, the farm, calls him away for certain regular hours and regular\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nIt is not worth while here to enter into the details of the question.\r\nThey are of serious moment, and involve among other things the driving\r\nof animals to and from pasture, _versus_ the raising of soiling crops to\r\nbe fed in the stall or yard. All of these questions have been\r\nsatisfactorily solved in the experience of many exceptional cases in\r\nthis country, and of the almost universal conditions obtaining in\r\nEurope. They present no practical difficulty, and need constitute no\r\nserious objection to the general plan.\r\n\r\nThe items of economical working and money-making being fully weighed,\r\nthe more serious considerations of the mode of life, and the good to be\r\ngot from it, demand even greater attention. It may seem a strange\r\ndoctrine to be advanced by a somewhat enthusiastic farmer, but it is a\r\ndoctrine that has been slowly accepted after many years' observation, a\r\nconviction that has taken possession of an unwilling mind, that the\r\nyoung man who takes his young wife to an isolated farmhouse dooms her\r\nand himself and their children to an unwholesome, unsatisfactory, and\r\nvacant existence,--an existence marked by the absence of those more\r\nsatisfying and more cultivating influences which the best development of\r\ncharacter and intelligence demand. It is a common experience of farmers'\r\nwives to pass week after week without exchanging a word or a look with a\r\nsingle person outside of their own family circles.\r\n\r\nThe young couple start bravely, and with a determination to struggle\r\nagainst the habit of isolation which marks their class. But this habit\r\nhas grown from the necessity of the situation; and the necessities of\r\ntheir own situation bring them sooner or later within its bonds. During\r\nthe first few years they adhere to their resolution, and go regularly to\r\nchurch, to the lecture, and to the social gatherings of their friends;\r\nbut home duties increase with time, and the eagerness for society grows\r\ndull with neglect. Those who have started out with the firmest\r\ndetermination to avoid the rock on which their fathers have split, give\r\nup the struggle at last, and settle down to a humdrum, uninteresting,\r\nand uninterested performance of daily tasks.\r\n\r\nIn saying all this,--and I speak from experience, for I have led the\r\ndismal life myself,--it is hardly necessary to disclaim the least want\r\nof appreciation of the sterling qualities which have been developed in\r\nthe American farm household. But it may be safely insisted that these\r\nqualities have been developed, not because of the American mode of farm\r\nlife, but in spite of it; and, as I think over the long list of\r\nadmirable men and women whose acquaintance I have formed on distant and\r\nsolitary farms, I am more and more impressed with certain shortcomings\r\nwhich would have been avoided under better social conditions. If any of\r\nthese is disposed to question the justice of this conclusion, I am\r\nsatisfied to leave the final decision with his own judgment, formed\r\nafter a fair consideration of what is herein suggested.\r\n\r\nIf American agriculture has an unsatisfied need, it is surely the need\r\nfor more intelligence and more enterprising interest on the part of its\r\nworking men and women. From one end of the land to the other, its crying\r\ndefect--recognized by all--is, that its best blood, or, in other words,\r\nits best brains and its best energy, is leaving it to seek other fields\r\nof labor. The influence which leads these best of the farmers' sons to\r\nother occupations is not so much the desire to make more money, or to\r\nfind a less laborious occupation, as it is the desire to lead a more\r\nsatisfactory life,--a life where that part of us which has been\r\ndeveloped by the better education and better civilization for which in\r\nthis century we have worked so hard and so well, may find responsive\r\ncompanionship and encouraging intercourse with others.\r\n\r\nIt so happens that the few farm villages to which we can refer--such as\r\nFarmington, Hadley, and Deerfield--have become so attractive by means of\r\ntheir full-grown beauty, or have been so encroached upon by the wealth\r\nthat has come over the district to which they belong, that they are no\r\nlonger to be taken as types of pure country villages; nor do I recall a\r\nsingle village in the land which is precisely what I have now in mind.\r\n\r\nAssuming that a farming neighborhood--two miles, or at the utmost three\r\nmiles, square--had been so arranged as to have all of its buildings\r\n(with the exception of hay-barracks in the fields, and cattle-shelters\r\nin the pastures) in a village, let us consider what would be the\r\nadvantages in the manner of living which it would have to offer.\r\n\r\nThe social benefits, and the facilities for frequent neighborly and\r\ninformal intercourse, are obvious. To say nothing of the companionships\r\nand intimacies among the young people, their fathers and mothers would\r\nbe kept from growing old and glum by constant friction with their kind;\r\nand, in so far as a more satisfactory social relation with one's\r\nfellow-men gives cheerfulness and the richness of a wider human\r\ninterest, in that proportion would the village life have a wholesome,\r\nmellowing effect that is not to be found in the remote farmhouse, nor\r\neven in the sort of neighborhood we sometimes find in the country where\r\nseveral farmhouses are within a quarter of a mile of each other. The\r\nhabit of \"running in\" for a moment's chat with a neighbor is a good one,\r\nand it gets but scant development among American farmers. This view of\r\nthe case will suggest itself quite naturally on the first consideration\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\nIf the first need of the rising generation--the men and women of the\r\nfuture--is education, then the village beats the farm by long odds. The\r\ncountry school-district, sparsely settled and chary of its taxes, is apt\r\nto obey the law in the scantiest way possible. Three months school in\r\nwinter and three months more in summer, under the supervision--it can\r\nhardly be called the instruction--of a young miss who is by no means\r\nwell educated herself, and who is entirely often without training as a\r\nteacher, gathers together all of the school-going children of a wide\r\nneighborhood. Big and little, boys and girls, are huddled together in a\r\nsort of mental jumble, where the best that the most skilful manager can\r\nhope for is to regulate the instruction and the discipline to suit the\r\naverage of the scholars. The best result attainable is to secure a good\r\namount of _schooling_: the word \"education\" would be quite misapplied\r\nhere.\r\n\r\nIn the village, the number of scholars would be sufficiently large to\r\nwarrant the establishment and to bear the maintenance of one good\r\nschool, with one, if not more, teachers, regularly employed, and worthy\r\nto be called teachers rather than \"school-marms.\" Pupils would be graded\r\naccording to their ages and acquirements, and a due use could be made of\r\nthe stimulus of competition. A real school, a real instrument of\r\neducation, would take the place of the noisy congregation of\r\nuncontrolled boys and girls, who, in the country district-school, are\r\napt to acquire less of valuable learning than of the minor viciousness\r\nthat prevails among country children.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, I was forcibly struck with the announcement of a\r\nGerman farmer once in my employ, whose reason for leaving me, after his\r\nchildren had reached the ages of seven and eleven, to return to his\r\nlittle village in Germany, was that it was impossible in this\r\ncountry--and this, be it remembered, was in New England--to secure\r\nsatisfactory instruction for them. He thought that in their experience\r\nat school here they had gained little beyond a familiarity with English,\r\nand with a large admixture of \"bad words\" at that. At home they would\r\nhave, within the elementary range of a primary-school education, a\r\nthorough training and a severe drilling which he could not hope for\r\nhere, and without which he was unwilling that they should grow up. I\r\nhave seen his village school in Germany, and the cloud of tow-headed\r\nchildren who fill it; and I am prepared to believe that his preference\r\nwas not without foundation. Of course we have all the material for as\r\ngood or better schools in this country. What we need is longer terms,\r\nbetter trained and educated teachers, graded classes, and better books\r\nand appliances. These cannot be afforded in the small country\r\nschool-district. They can be had in their perfection in even a small\r\nvillage; and this consideration alone, even if this were all, should be\r\na controlling argument in favor of village life.\r\n\r\nBut this is by no means all. Another great benefit is to be found in the\r\npost-office near at hand, with its daily mail as an encouragement to\r\ncorrespondence and to interest in the affairs of the outside world. A\r\nvillage, such as is here pictured, could afford its weekly or\r\nsemi-monthly public lecture, furnishing a means for instruction and\r\nentertainment, and for frequent gatherings. The church, too, would\r\nprobably be conducted in a more satisfactory way than is usual in the\r\ncountry; and the conditions would be the best suited for fostering that\r\ninterest in the collateral branches of the church, the Bible-class, the\r\nSunday school, and the Dorcas society, by which the women of the\r\ncommunity get, aside from the other good that they receive and do,\r\nadvantages of a character somewhat corresponding to those which men get\r\nfrom their clubs.\r\n\r\nI should hope further, as an outgrowth from the community of living, for\r\na modest village library and reading-room. Indeed, if I could have my\r\nown way, I should not confine the attraction and entertainment of the\r\nvillage to strictly \"moral\" appliances. It would probably be wiser to\r\nrecognize the fact that young men find an attraction in amusements which\r\nour sterner ancestors regarded as dangerous; and I would not eschew\r\nbilliards, nor even, \"by rigorous enactment,\" the milder vice of social\r\ntobacco. Better have a little _harmless_ wickedness near home and under\r\nthe eye of parents than to encounter the risk that boys, after a certain\r\nage, would seek a pretext for more uncontrolled indulgences in the\r\nneighboring town.\r\n\r\nOne might go on through the long range of incidental arguments--such as\r\nlighted streets, well-kept sidewalks, winter snow-ploughs, and good\r\ndrainage, and a wholesome pride in a tidy, cosey village, until even the\r\nmost close-fisted of all our class would confess that the extra cost\r\nwould bring full value in return, and until he would recognize the fact\r\nthat the attractions of such a home as the village would make possible\r\nwould be likely to insure his being succeeded in his wholesome trade by\r\nthe brightest and best of his sons,--a result that would surely be worth\r\nmore than all it would cost.\r\n\r\nBut my purpose has been only to suggest a scheme which seems to me\r\nentirely, even though remotely, practicable, and in which I hope for the\r\nsympathy and help of the country-bound farmers' wives and daughters,--a\r\nscheme which promises what seems the easiest, if not the only, relief\r\nfor the dulness and desolation of living which make American farming\r\nloathsome to so many who ought to glory in its pursuit, but who now are\r\nonly bound to it by commanding necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE AND WORK OF THE EASTERN FARMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are all familiar with the lavish praise bestowed--especially when\r\nvotes are to be secured--upon the \"bone and sinew of the country;\" but\r\nthe farmers themselves are very far from accepting as true, even if\r\nsincere, the estimate of their qualities which the editor and the public\r\nspeaker so loudly profess.\r\n\r\nThe average farmer is precisely what any other average man would be who\r\nhad grown up under the same conditions. There is no mysterious charm\r\nbelonging to his occupation which removes him beyond the reach of the\r\ninfluences by which all mankind are controlled. Coming from the same\r\noriginal stock and inheriting the same peculiarities of race, he is\r\nessentially the same as men in other vocations. The character of his\r\nwork, the necessities of his financial condition, and the social\r\nsurroundings amid which he has been reared, have had the same influence\r\nin moulding his character that similar conditions have had in moulding\r\nthe characters of others.\r\n\r\nFarming is in a certain sense the basis of all individual and national\r\nprosperity; but the case would be more fairly stated were we to say that\r\nfarming happens to be the first step in an industrial process, many\r\nsteps of which are alike essential to civilization. The farmer produces\r\nraw material, and without raw material the world must come to a stop;\r\nbut the butcher, the baker, the spinner, the weaver, and every artisan,\r\nrender as essential service in the development of this raw material into\r\nthe forms demanded by modern life, as does the farmer in growing it.\r\n\r\nAs a member of the farmer class, I hasten to disclaim for it any\r\n_especial_ consideration given it because of its contribution to the\r\nwelfare of mankind. We are as useful as any other hard-working people,\r\nno more and no less. We claim no higher appreciation for muscular effort\r\nexerted in swinging the flail than for that applied to the wielding of\r\nthe hammer.\r\n\r\nThe controlling motive of a farmer in performing his work and carrying\r\non his business is the hope of material gain. He works for the money\r\nthat he expects to earn, and not with any conscious reference to the\r\nservice he is rendering to the world. In this capacity as a farmer he is\r\nneither a philanthropist nor a patriot, only a man of business. If we\r\nwish properly to estimate his character and his value as a factor of\r\nmodern civilization, we must not be misled by sentimental considerations\r\nas to his relation with nature and his \"noble\" occupation.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of Eastern farming and of Eastern farm life are the true\r\nindex, as they are the true cause, of the character of the Eastern\r\nfarmer. These conditions are constantly varying, and their effect is\r\nalways modified by individual qualities.\r\n\r\nIt may be possible to strike such an average as shall afford a tolerably\r\ngood suggestion of the real character and condition of the farmer, and a\r\nhint as to his future; that is to say, certain prevalent influences tend\r\nto mark the type, and certain modifications of these influences may lead\r\nto its improvement. Any attempt to portray the class as a whole would\r\nbe met by such a list of exceptions as would seriously affect the\r\nresult; but the following may be considered true in a large number of\r\ncases, and applicable, with minor changes, to many more.\r\n\r\nLet us take the case of an outlying farm in New England, of one hundred\r\nacres,--a farm that has been in cultivation from the earlier settlement\r\nof the country, and which is of the average degree of improvement, with\r\nthe usual division into arable, mowing, pasture, and wood land. It lies\r\ntwo or three miles away from a considerable town or village, and its\r\nchief industry is the selling of milk in the town. With an allowance of\r\ntwo acres per cow for summer pasture, and of one and a half acres of\r\nmowing-land for winter feeding, the cows it keeps number about a dozen.\r\nFor team-work on the farm and for road-work and pleasure-driving, there\r\nare kept two horses and two oxen. In addition to these there will be a\r\ngreater or less amount of young stock and the usual swine and poultry,\r\nand perhaps a few sheep. The farmer himself is the chief workman on the\r\nplace, and he has the regular help of a hired man or a grown son. An\r\nextra hand during the working season is usual; but in winter the farmer\r\nand his one assistant will do all of the work of feeding, milking,\r\ndelivering the milk, hauling out manure, etc.\r\n\r\nA few years ago the housework was done almost entirely by the mother of\r\nthe family and her daughters, or by a girl taken to \"bring up;\" but\r\nlatterly the more troublesome element of an Irish girl in the kitchen\r\nhas become general, for the daughter of the farmer has aspirations and\r\ntastes which disqualify her for efficient household drudgery. In spite\r\nof all modern appliances, much of the work of the farmer's household\r\nmust be so characterized. The life of American farm women is, however,\r\nnot now under discussion: the subject is a fruitful one, and has\r\nimportant bearings upon the development of the race; but what we are to\r\nconsider here is simply the work and condition of the farmer himself.\r\nThe milk-selling farmer--and this industry is one of the most\r\nwide-spread in Eastern farming--is more regularly employed than any\r\nother. Winter and summer his cows must be milked twice a day. Evening's\r\nmilk must be cooled and safely kept until morning; and morning's milk\r\nmust be ready for early delivery. It is usual for the farmer to rise at\r\nthree every morning, winter and summer, to milk his cows,--with one\r\nassistant,--and to start as early as five o'clock to deliver his milk.\r\nReturning about the middle of the forenoon, he is able to attend to the\r\ndetails of barn-work in winter and field-work in summer, until half-past\r\ntwo or three o'clock in the afternoon, less the brief interval needed\r\nfor the consumption of food. Early in the afternoon the cows must be\r\nagain milked, and the cans of milk must in summertime be set in spring\r\nwater for cooling. Then comes the feeding of the stock and the greasing\r\nof axles, the mending of harness, the repairing of tools, and the\r\nthousand and one odds and ends of the farmer's irregular work. In the\r\nwinter, save for the early rising and the work of cold mornings, life is\r\nby no means hurried; and after a very early supper there is often a\r\nstroll to the corner store or to a neighbor's house, for a little\r\nwholesome idleness and gossip,--the latter not invariably wholesome. At\r\nabout the hour when the average reader of \"The Atlantic\" has finished\r\nhis after-dinner cigar, all lights are extinguished, and the farm\r\nhousehold is wrapped in heavy slumber; for such early rising as the\r\nmilk-farmer is condemned to must needs trench upon the valuable evening\r\nhours for requisite rest and sleep.\r\n\r\nIn summer the conditions of life are immeasurably hardened. The farmer\r\nhimself is necessarily absent several hours every morning with his\r\nmilk-wagon; but, although he cannot lend a hand at the early field work,\r\nthis work must go on with promptness, and he must arrange in advance for\r\nits proper performance. From the moment when he has finished his late\r\nbreakfast until the last glimmer of twilight, he is doomed to harrowing\r\nand often anxious toil. There is no wide margin of profit that will\r\nadmit of a slackening of the pace. Land must be prepared for planting;\r\nplanting must be done when the condition of the ground and the state of\r\nthe weather permit. Weeds grow without regard to our convenience, and\r\nthey must be kept down from the first; and well on into the intervals of\r\nthe hay-harvest the corn-field needs all of the cultivation that there\r\nis time for. Regularly as clock-work, in the late hours of the night and\r\nthe early hours of the afternoon, the milking must be attended to; and\r\nthe daily trip to town knows no exception because of heat, rain, or\r\nsnow. At rigidly fixed hours this part of the work _must_ be done; and\r\nall other hours of the growing and of the harvest seasons are almost\r\nmore than filled with work of imperative need. These alone seem to make\r\na sufficient demand on the patience and endurance of the most\r\nindustrious farmer; but, aside from these, he is loaded with the endless\r\ndetails of an intricate business, and with the responsibility of the\r\nsuccessful management of a capital of from fifteen to twenty thousand\r\ndollars, upon the safety and the economical management of which his\r\nsuccess entirely depends; he must avoid leakage and waste, and make\r\nevery dollar paid for labor, or seed, or manure, or live stock, bring\r\nits adequate return.\r\n\r\nProbably no occupation in the world can compare with farming in the\r\nopportunity that it offers for the _losing_ of money. Nothing is so\r\nenticing as slate-and-pencil farming. Ten acres of land can be ploughed,\r\nmanured, and planted with corn, and the crop can be well cultivated and\r\nharvested for so many dollars. Such land with such manuring and\r\ncultivation may be trusted to yield so many bushels of corn to the\r\nacre; and, after making due allowance for chance, the balance of the\r\ncalculation shows a snug profit. In like manner we may figure out a\r\ncorresponding return from the hay-fields, from the root-crops, from two\r\nor three acres of potatoes, and from a patch of garden-truck for which\r\nthe neighboring village will furnish a good market. Then the poultry\r\nwill return a profitable income in eggs and in \"broilers;\" and\r\naltogether it is easy for an enthusiastic person to show how interest on\r\ninvested capital and good compensation for labor are to be secured in\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nBut when the test of practice is applied to our well-studied and proven\r\nscheme; when we see how far our allowance for \"chances\" has fallen below\r\nwhat is needed to cover the contingencies of late springs, dry summers,\r\nearly frosts, grasshoppers, wire-worms, Colorado beetles, midge, weevil,\r\npip, murrain, garget, milk-fever, potato-rot, oats-rust, winter-killing,\r\nand all the rest; when we learn the degree of vigilance needed to keep\r\nevery minute of hired labor and team-work effectively employed; and when\r\nwe come finally to the items of low markets and bad debts,--we shall\r\nsee how far these and similar drawbacks have undone our arithmetic, and\r\nhow often our well-contrived balance must be taken into the footings of\r\nthe other column of figures.\r\n\r\nThe regular work of the farmer, as indicated in the foregoing sketch of\r\nhis occupations, and as perceptible to the summer boarder who watches\r\nhis work from the piazza, although arduous and exacting, may be quite\r\ncompatible with a happy life; and, when we estimate the promise of the\r\noccupation as offering a pleasant livelihood, no able-bodied man need be\r\ndeterred by it. But when we add this long list of contingencies, and\r\nconsider the ceaseless anxiety that they bring, we may well hesitate\r\nbefore adopting such a life for ourselves or desiring it for our\r\nchildren. No true estimate of the developed character of the farmer can\r\nbe formed without giving due value to this uncertain factor in the\r\ncalculation.\r\n\r\nInstances are hardly exceptional where a clear natural intelligence, an\r\nindomitable courage, and great industry, have turned themselves into a\r\nreal source of mental and moral strength. Success achieved in spite of\r\nsuch drawbacks is all the sweeter and all the more inspiriting because\r\nof them. But if we take the case of the average farmer with average\r\nhuman weaknesses, we cannot fail to see, that, however well he may have\r\nborne up against the more obvious requirements of his work, he has been\r\nwarped and cramped, and often made in many ways unlovely, by the hard\r\nand anxious toil through which his halting success has been attained.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every other occupation than farming, the hardest worker finds\r\na daily relief from his toil, and from the suggestion of toil, in a home\r\nthat is entirely apart from his industry. However arduous and anxious\r\nand long-continued the work, there comes a time when it is laid aside,\r\nand when the workman goes into a new sphere, where the atmosphere is\r\nentirely changed. His home is a place of rest and pleasure, or at least\r\na place of change. The pen and the hammer are left in the counting-room\r\nand in the shop; and, however far the home may fall below his desires\r\nand ambition, it is at least free from the cares of the day's\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nThe American farmer has no such relief. His house is a part of his farm;\r\nhis fireside is shared by an uncongenial hired man, his family circle\r\nincludes too often a vulgar and uninteresting servant; and from one year\r\nto another, his living-room being the kitchen and work-room of the busy\r\nfarmhouse, he rarely knows what it is to divest himself of the\r\nsurroundings of his labor and business, and to give himself over to the\r\nneeded domestic enjoyment and recreation. It is this feature of his\r\nlife, more than any other, which seems objectionable. If it is\r\nobjectionable for him, it is infinitely more so for his wife and\r\ndaughters, who, lacking the frequent visit to the town or occasional\r\nchat with strangers, and the invigorating effect of open-air work, yield\r\nall the more completely to depressing cares. They become more and more\r\ndeficient in the lightness and cheerfulness and mental gayety to which\r\nin any other occupation the chief toiler of the family would look for\r\nrecreation at his own fireside.\r\n\r\nSo far as interest in his business is concerned, the farmer's condition\r\nis in every way elevated when he devotes himself to some improved form\r\nof agriculture, or to some special industry which gives him better\r\ncompensation for his work. This benefit by no means generally results\r\nfrom an attempt at \"scientific\" agriculture, nor is the adoption of a\r\nspecial industry by any means generally successful. Failure in either of\r\nthese directions is disheartening and discouraging to those who are\r\nwatching his example. There are many well-tried improvements upon the\r\nold methods of our fathers which are universally adopted, especially in\r\nthe direction of the use of better implements and more judicious care in\r\nthe application of manure. But the average agricultural newspaper, while\r\ndoing great good, has naturally led enthusiastic men to see a chance for\r\nameliorating their condition by the adoption of processes which are not\r\nsuited to their circumstances, or which they themselves are not\r\nqualified to carry out. It is this that has led to the outcry--much more\r\nprevalent a generation ago than now--against \"book-farming.\" On the\r\nwhole, whatever may have been the influences of agricultural writers\r\nupon the fortunes of their early converts, they have vastly modified and\r\nimproved all modern farm-work, and have greatly benefited the more\r\nrecent farmer.\r\n\r\nThe conditions of the industry are hard, chiefly because the business of\r\nfarming is a laborious one, and one in which an enormous population is\r\nworking, with dogged industry, for a moderate reward. However\r\nenterprising and intelligent a farmer may be, when he goes to market to\r\nsell his crops he finds himself in active competition with men who are\r\nworking for their bare subsistence.\r\n\r\nMuch is said about the competition of the farmers of the rich West as a\r\nserious obstacle to success at the East. This is the case only in so far\r\nas the Eastern farmer attempts to compete with the Western in the\r\nproduction of crops which will bear storage and long transportation. As\r\na business proposition, it seems clear that this drawback is to be\r\novercome only by the cultivation at the East of such products as it is\r\nnot within the power of Western competition to supply, or only such as\r\nour situation and the good quality of our land will enable us to produce\r\nat low cost. Milk, fresh butter, and hay are the three most promising\r\nstaples, for which so large a demand exists as to furnish employment for\r\nthe whole farming population. Hay from its bulk does not bear a very\r\nlong transportation. Milk will always bring a higher price when\r\nproduced near to the point where it is to be consumed. Butter-making is\r\nnot an especially profitable industry if we depend upon the average\r\ngrocery-store demand; but it is possible for any farmer at the East, who\r\nwill take the trouble to make and to retain a good reputation for his\r\ndairy, to secure a price enough higher than that of the regular market\r\nto constitute a good margin of profit.\r\n\r\nSo far as relief in Eastern farming is to be achieved with no material\r\nchange in the character of life and work, it must apparently be sought\r\nin these directions. In his relation to Eastern civilization, past,\r\npresent, and prospective, it may fairly be questioned whether the\r\ninfluence of the Eastern farmer is increased since the general\r\nintroduction of railroads; and we are justified in looking with some\r\nanxiety to the relative position which he is to hold hereafter.\r\n\r\nThere are well-known influences at work which are not promising. The\r\ndesire of the sons and daughters of the farmer to obtain some other\r\nmeans of livelihood, and the too frequent yielding to this temptation on\r\nthe part of the more intelligent of these young persons, is the most\r\nobvious danger to the future of the industry.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of the dignity and independence which come of the\r\nownership of land; but it is possible that this influence has been\r\nover-estimated, and that our ideas of it have been derived more or less\r\nfrom our European traditions. Perhaps, after all, we ought to and do\r\nattach the most importance to that which is the most rare. In England,\r\nwhere the ownership of land carries with it a certain social dignity,\r\nand where the mere possession of money has a less marked influence in\r\nthis direction, there is no doubt that the title-deeds to broad acres\r\nconstitute a certain sort of patent of nobility. In this country, where\r\nland is plenty and cheap and where large fortunes are rare, a farmer\r\ngets consideration less for the amount of land that he himself owns,\r\nthan for the sum-total of the mortgages which he holds upon his\r\nneighbors' land. That is to say, it is better to be rich in money than\r\nin land; and instances are comparatively rare, even among those who are\r\ncultivating their ancestral acres, where the farm would not be gladly\r\nsold for a sum of which the income would secure a better and easier mode\r\nof life. The farm is not regarded with especial affection: it is mainly\r\nregarded--along with its stock and tools--as an instrument for making\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nThe American farmer is distinguished from the English farmer chiefly by\r\nhaving his capital invested in the land which he cultivates, rather than\r\nin the tools and live stock and working capital needed to carry on his\r\nbusiness. As a general rule the farmer's whole fortune is invested in\r\nhis land. Often his farm is mortgaged, and he has little loose money\r\nwith which to improve his system of work. The necessity for making a\r\nliving and paying interest, without sufficient capital for the best\r\nmanagement, makes the life of the farmer too often a grinding one. If he\r\nis skilful and industrious and prudent, he may hope with certainty to\r\nfree himself from debt, and to accumulate a respectable support for his\r\nold age.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider any class of working people, as a class, this is\r\nperhaps all that we can hope for under any circumstances. The unhopeful\r\nthing about it all is that while farmers work less hard than their\r\nfathers did, and while they get a better return for their work, the\r\nsurroundings of their life have not improved as have those of men\r\nengaged in other industries, so that although actually much better off\r\nthan their ancestors were, they are relatively less well off in the more\r\nattractive conditions of other classes of workmen; and this deficiency\r\nis driving away the children on whom they ought to depend for assistance\r\nand for succession.\r\n\r\nIn the abstract, farming is a dignified occupation, and in proportion as\r\nit borrows aid from science it becomes more dignified. So far as the\r\ncasual observer can see, it combines more of what is desirable than does\r\nany other pursuit. While it promises no brilliant reward, it insures a\r\nsteady, reliable, and sufficient return for the capital and labor\r\ninvested in it. It promises a sure provision for old age, and it secures\r\nthe wholesome pride that comes of the ownership of visible property.\r\nIndeed, look at it and argue about it as we may, it is not easy to see\r\nwhy it is not the best occupation for a wholesome and intelligent man.\r\n\r\nThose who know the condition of the art intimately, and who have studied\r\nthe influences of its work and its life upon those who are engaged in\r\nit, recognize serious drawbacks which must in some way be removed unless\r\nit is to fall away still more from its original character, and is to be\r\ngiven over to German and Irish immigrants, who, during one or two\r\ngenerations, will be contented with what it has to offer. It is\r\ndifficult even to theorize as to the means of relief, if farming must be\r\nconsidered, first of all, as a means for obtaining a livelihood and for\r\nmaking money; and no effort to improve the situation of the farmer will\r\nbe successful which does not keep this prime necessity always in view.\r\nIt is easy to see how the condition of any farmer's family might be\r\nimproved by a large additional income; but there is no obvious source\r\nfrom which this increase is to be drawn, nor will he adopt any scheme\r\nthat will endanger the income that he now receives.\r\n\r\nIf we could convert the farmer into a chemist and physiologist, and give\r\nhim the satisfaction that comes of controlling the combinations of\r\nphysical and chemical materials according to laws which he understands,\r\nand of securing his results with scientific accuracy, we should\r\naccomplish our purpose; for no man with such scientific knowledge,\r\nrealizing its relation to his daily work, could fail of an enthusiastic\r\nfondness for his profession. But the worst of it is that all efforts in\r\nthis direction have generally ended in producing a \"smatterer,\" whose\r\ntheories are baffled by constant disappointment, and whose worldly\r\nprosperity is lessened by his mistaken experiments.\r\n\r\nSuccessful farming implies, first of all, steady and dogged hard work,\r\ncoupled with prudent and watchful skill. When the hopes of enthusiastic\r\nagricultural reformers are considered with the practical eye of cold\r\ncommon sense, they must inevitably be condemned to disappointment. In so\r\nfar as they constitute an incentive towards improvement, they work great\r\ngood; but the success of the future is to be attained too often through\r\nthe distressing failure of the present. The art is an experimental one,\r\nand the temptations to extend experiments are enticing. Unfortunately,\r\nnovel processes depend for their success upon contingencies which are\r\nlikely to be disregarded at the outset; and, however much any\r\nimprovement may be destined to prosper after its application shall have\r\nbeen practically tested and modified, it is altogether likely that its\r\nfirst introduction will result in failure. The mere money losses coming\r\nof these failures are not so serious; but the discouragement and\r\ndisappointment that they entail exert the gravest influence where what\r\nis chiefly needed is the encouragement of success.\r\n\r\nIt is something to know the direction that improving effort should take;\r\nand it seems to be generally conceded that what American agriculture\r\nneeds, at the East and at the West, but especially at the East, is _an\r\nimprovement in the character of its personnel_. There is everywhere\r\nample opportunity for the profitable and successful introduction of\r\nmodified processes and of new industries. There is, too, hardly an\r\ninstance where the processes and industries now pursued are not\r\nsusceptible of great improvement of detail. There are few farms so well\r\nmanaged and so successful, that if given into the hands of better, more\r\nintelligent, and more enterprising farmers, they would not produce\r\nbetter results. The father is working according to his light, and is\r\ndirecting his work by such intelligence as his natural capacity and his\r\ntraining have given him. His brighter son, with more natural\r\nintelligence, with a better education, and less trammelled by\r\ntraditions and prejudices, might so modify the same industry as to make\r\nit more certain, more profitable, and in every way more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe change that is now taking place, especially in New England, is\r\ntoward the greater economy of living, and the harder work and closer\r\nmanagement of business, that comes with immigrant proprietorship; and\r\nthis element is by no means to be depended upon for the improvement of\r\nour farming. It may result in a more money-making agriculture, but it\r\nwill supplant our best political element by the introduction of what has\r\nthus far seemed to be one of the worst.\r\n\r\nLook at this question as we will, it is difficult to see how else than\r\nby improving the race of American farmers we are to accomplish any\r\nresult whose good effect will be radical and lasting. This brings us\r\naround to that threadbare subject of the vague discussion of\r\nagricultural writers: \"How to keep the boys on the farm.\"\r\n\r\nThe devices recommended for accomplishing this result have thus far\r\nfailed of their object. The average farmer boy is not a sentimentalist,\r\nand he is not likely to be moved by the sort of talk so often lavished\r\nupon him. To use a vulgarism, he has an extremely \"level head.\" He fails\r\nto realize the attraction and the dignity which are implied by what he\r\nis told of the nobleness of his father's calling, of the purifying and\r\nelevating influences of a daily intercourse with nature. He is not to be\r\ncaught with this sort of chaff. His cultivation has not been of that\r\naesthetic character that he has an especial drawing toward nobleness, or\r\npurity, or elevation. Nature, as he knows it, shows at times an\r\nunattractive side; and he fails to recognize precisely what is meant by\r\nMother Earth as a source of dignity. To him Mother Earth is an exacting\r\nparent, calling for constant and regular toil, and whipping him on day\r\nby day with weeds to be hoed, dry gardens to be watered, snowdrifts to\r\nbe shovelled, and an almost endless round of embarrassments to be\r\novercome. As for the purity and simplicity of the farmer's life, he\r\nknows very much better than to pin his faith to it. To him the farmer's\r\nhouse is too often a place where the mother is overworked, tired,\r\nwearied with constant annoyance, and made peevish and fretful. The\r\nconversation of hired men and young neighbors and brothers is not\r\nmarked by refined delicacy and simplicity, as he understands these\r\nterms. At the end of all our preaching he will say, at least to himself,\r\nthat this is probably the sort of talk that we consider appropriate to\r\nthe occasion, but that, if we knew what he knows about farming, we\r\nshould see how little effect it is likely to have. If he sought our\r\nmotive in saying it, he would conclude that we were interested in\r\nkeeping up the supply of farm labor; and that so far as _he_ was\r\nconcerned, since he must work for a living, he would work at some other\r\nindustry if he could get a chance, and leave those who were less\r\nfortunate to work on the farm.\r\n\r\nThe more sentimental and more influential considerations governing in\r\nthis matter were very well set forth by Dr. Holland in a paper on Farm\r\nLife in New England, published in \"The Atlantic Monthly\" some twenty\r\nyears ago. While acknowledging the frequency of bright exceptions to the\r\nrule, he does not hesitate to set it down as a rule that the life\r\ndescribed is in every way a hateful one; where every member of the\r\nfamily, from father to child, is driven by the lash of stern necessity,\r\nand where many conditions which are deemed requisite in the life of all\r\nother classes of the same wealth are comparatively rare; where the\r\nexpectant mother of the child is worked without stint to her last day,\r\nwhile the mother of the colt is relieved from all hard toil and treated\r\nwith consideration throughout the last months of her time; where, in\r\nshort, whether from interest or from a mistaken idea of necessity, hard\r\nwork long hours, poor food, and dismal surroundings are the rule of the\r\nfarmer's household.\r\n\r\nSince that time there have been noticeable modifications, involving the\r\nintroduction of more or less tastefulness, because of the cheap\r\nliterature and cheap music of these later days. But, much as these have\r\ndone to affect the individual characters of the younger members of the\r\nfamily, they have only aggravated the evil, so far as farm-work is\r\nconcerned, by creating a desire, born of knowledge, for the pleasanter\r\nmanner of life which the town has to offer. The young girls whom one now\r\nsees about railway stations in the most distant part of the country are\r\ndressed after the instructions of \"Harper's Bazar\" and \"Peterson's\r\nMagazine;\" and they know more than their older sisters did of the\r\ndifference between their own life and that of their city cousins. They\r\nare certainly not to be blamed if they long for some vocation in which\r\nthey can more freely indulge their growing ideas of luxury, and gratify\r\ntheir growing desire for better dress and more interesting\r\ncompanionship.\r\n\r\nAll that has here been said is seriously true and important. The\r\ncircumstances described are so generally prevalent as to constitute,\r\nwith constant minor variations, an almost universal rule. Where we are\r\nto look for relief, is the most serious problem. Relief must be found,\r\nor the character of our farming class must assuredly degenerate. In one\r\nway or another we must change, in a radical degree, the conditions of\r\nthe farmer's life. We can perfectly understand why it should be\r\ndistasteful to any young person of ordinary ambition or intelligence;\r\nand we know, from the constant flocking of farmers' sons and daughters\r\nto even the least attractive employments of the town or village, that\r\nthis distaste is everywhere a controlling one.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to say that the farmer's life must be made more cheerful,\r\nattractive, and refined, and less arduous; but it is by no means easy\r\nto see how the improvement is to be brought about. The cardinal defect\r\nis the loneliness and dulness of the isolated farmhouse. Intelligent and\r\neducated young women, brought up among the pleasantest surroundings,\r\nmarry young farmers, and undertake their new life with the determination\r\nthat, in their case at least, the more obvious social requirements shall\r\nbe met. During the earlier years after marriage they adhere to their\r\nresolution, and are regular in attendance at the church and public\r\nlecture; and they keep up, so far as possible, social intercourse with\r\ntheir neighbors. But as time goes on, as the family increases, as toil\r\nbegins to tell on health and strength and energy, they drop out, little\r\nby little, from the habit of going abroad, until often for weeks\r\ntogether they never exchange a look or thought with any human being\r\noutside of their own households. Aside from the overworked members of\r\ntheir own families, their companionship is confined to hired men who\r\nsmell of the stable, and to hired girls with whom they are yoked in the\r\ndaily round of household duties.\r\n\r\nHaving given much consideration to the subject, I have come to believe\r\nthat the agriculture of Continental Europe is far more wisely arranged\r\nthan ours; for there, almost as a universal rule, isolated farm-life is\r\nunknown. The reward of the cultivator is less, and his labor is at least\r\nas great. The people are of a very much lower order, and are lacking in\r\nthe cultivated intelligence which distinguishes so many of our own\r\nfarming class. Women and even young girls perform rude labor in the\r\nfield and in the stable; and those aspirations which are born of a\r\nuniversal diffusion of periodical literature are almost unknown. At the\r\nsame time, when the hard and long day's work is over, there comes to all\r\nthe inexpressible relief and delight of the active social intercourse of\r\nthe village, where the tillers of the country for a mile around have\r\ngathered together their homes and their herds, and where the most\r\nintimate social life prevails.\r\n\r\nObservation even indicates that the habit of out-of-door labor has had\r\nno injurious effect upon the women of these villages. The \"nut-brown\r\nmaid\" grows too fast into the wrinkled-brown woman; but better a\r\nsunburnt and weather-beaten cheek than that pallor that comes of\r\nanthracite and in-door toil. Better the broad back and stout limb of the\r\npeasant mother than the hollow chest and wasted energy of the American\r\nfarmer's wife.\r\n\r\nI by no means intend to say that our own farming class is not far\r\nsuperior to the peasantry of Europe; but I do believe that if a good\r\nsystem of village life for farmers could be adopted here under the\r\nmodifying influences of the more refined and intelligent American\r\ncharacter, we should have gained a most important step in advance. We\r\nhave in New England many villages almost exclusively of\r\nfarmers,--villages where the old-time settlers gathered together for\r\ndefence against the Indians, and for the protection of houses and stock\r\nand store from river floods. These villages are as different as it is\r\npossible to conceive from the ordinary European cluster of unattractive\r\ncottages, lining both sides of a street which is filled for one-half of\r\nits width with manure-heaps. It may be naturally assumed that any\r\nadaptation of the village system among us would be governed by the same\r\nrefining influences which have made our few existing agricultural\r\nvillages so beautiful and attractive.\r\n\r\nThat which most distinguishes American people is the general spread of\r\neducation among them; but it is, after all, an education which soon\r\nreaches its limit, and, so far as the district-school of a\r\nsparsely-settled country neighborhood is concerned, it goes little\r\nbeyond the simplest rudiments. An inexperienced young miss holds school\r\nfor not more than one-half the year in an unattractive and inconvenient\r\nroom, in which are gathered together most of the boys and girls of the\r\nschool-going age from all the farms about. The books and other\r\nappliances of instruction are inadequate. There is no grading of the\r\npupils, and the frequent change of teachers prevents the possibility of\r\nexperienced instructions. Even in the meanest peasant village of\r\nGermany, a village always prolific in children, an inexorable law\r\ncompels all between the ages of five and fourteen to attend regularly\r\nthe teaching of a master, an officer of the state, who has generally\r\nadopted his profession for life, and who adds to a certain specified\r\ndegree of capability the advantages of long experience.\r\n\r\nNo thoughtful person can fail to be convinced, after a due consideration\r\nof the argument in its favor, that, if the social influences\r\ninseparable from village-life could be secured to the American farmer,\r\nthe greatest drawback of his life would be done away with. It remains,\r\nunfortunately, a serious question, how far such a radical change is\r\npracticable. There is little doubt that the family would naturally drift\r\ninto some more costly style of living; and the necessity for hauling to\r\na distant home all the crops of the fields, and of hauling out the\r\nmanure made at the homestead, would add somewhat to the expenses of the\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the individual farmer now cultivating land upon which he\r\nlives, it is not unlikely that he would find a certain pecuniary\r\ndisadvantage in the change. But, as a broad question of the future\r\nbenefit of our agriculture, it must be conceded that whatever will tend\r\nto make the occupation more attractive cannot fail, by enlisting the\r\nservices of more intelligent minds, to insure its very decided\r\nimprovement. As the case now stands, the farmer's son will become a\r\nclerk or a mechanic rather than remain a farmer, because clerks and\r\nmechanics live in communities where there is more to interest the mind,\r\nand where, too, the opportunities for enjoyment and amusement are\r\ngreater. The farmer's daughter will marry the clerk or the mechanic\r\nrather than a farmer, because she knows the life of a farmer's wife to\r\nbe a life of dulness and dearth, while she believes that the wife of the\r\nclerk or mechanic will be condemned to less arduous labor, and will have\r\nmuch more agreeable surroundings. I have no means of judging what may\r\nhave been the experience in Deerfield, Mass., for instance; but I am\r\nconfident that many a mechanic's daughter, and indeed many young women\r\nof much higher position in life, would consider her lot a fortunate one\r\nin becoming the wife of a farmer whose homestead lay on the beautiful\r\nstreet of this old village.\r\n\r\nAll that is here said is, to a certain extent, mere theory; but the\r\nsubject is one that has not thus far met any practical solution, and in\r\nwhich, therefore, nothing except theorizing is possible. The broad fact\r\nis that the farming class in this country is degenerating by the\r\nwithdrawal of its best blood; and still more serious injury is being\r\ndone to it by the introduction of the lower class of foreigners. It may\r\nwell be doubted whether it is possible so to modify the manner of life\r\nof the isolated farmhouse as to make it materially more attractive to\r\nAmerican boys and girls. All that can be done is to rob it of its\r\nisolation by withdrawing its people, and placing them under better\r\nconditions of life.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the only way that seems to offer to keep the boys on the farm\r\nis to move everybody off of the farm, bringing them together into snug\r\nlittle communities, where they may secure, without abandoning the\r\nmanifest advantages of their occupation, the greater social interest and\r\nstimulus which they now hope to enjoy by going into other callings whose\r\nnatural advantages are less. That such a course as this would restore\r\nthe farmer to his former position as a leading element in Eastern\r\ncivilization, cannot be questioned. That he will retain even the\r\nrelative influence that he exercises to-day, unless some radical change\r\nis made, is at least very doubtful.\r\n\r\nIn considering the questions here suggested, we must never lose sight of\r\nthe fact that the controlling element is economy. The farmer exists\r\nbecause he is needed. The world demands the products that he produces,\r\nand the world must needs pay him a living compensation for them. No\r\nchange will be possible which disregards this; and all who know the\r\npresent circumstances which control the reward of the farming class know\r\nthat these circumstances would be inadequate to maintain him in a life\r\nof greater ease, while calling for greater expense. This gives the added\r\nembarrassment that we must not only change the mode of life, but must\r\nalso increase the ratio of profit, if this is possible. This is possible\r\nonly through a reduction of the area cultivated, the cultivation of this\r\nreduced area in a more thorough and profitable way, and the turning of\r\nfarming industry into channels better adapted to securing a profitable\r\nreturn.\r\n\r\nTo discuss a modification of the whole system of farming would involve\r\nfar more detail than is possible in this paper, since such a discussion\r\nmust include the consideration of features which would change with\r\nchanging locality; but, by way of illustration, we may take the\r\npreviously supposed case of a farmer owning one hundred acres of land,\r\nand milking a dozen cows, selling the milk as before in the distant\r\ntown. Assume that he and his neighbors within a radius of about a mile\r\nare living in a central village, from which his land is one mile\r\ndistant. During the working season, say from the middle of April until\r\nlate in October, he must, with his teams and assistants, spend the whole\r\nday on the land. The cows are milked and all stable work done before\r\nbreakfast, and some one drives them out to pasture. The men remain\r\na-field until an hour before sunset. They must be content with a cold\r\ndinner, as is the usual custom with mechanics and laborers. The cows are\r\ndriven home in time for the evening milking, and are put into the\r\nbarnyard at night with green fodder brought home by the returning teams.\r\nAfter the \"chores\" are done, and a hearty and substantial supper is\r\neaten,--the principal meal of the day,--all hands will be too weary for\r\nmuch enjoyment of the evening, but not so weary that they will not\r\nappreciate the difference between the lounging places of a village and\r\nthe former dulness at the farm. Other farmers in the neighborhood will,\r\nmany of them, also be milk producers; and, as the stables are near\r\ntogether, they will naturally co-operate, sending their milk to market\r\nwith a single team, employing the services of a single man in the place\r\nof five or six men and teams heretofore needed to market the same milk.\r\nI have recently received an account of this sort of co-operation, where\r\nthe cost of selling was reduced to a fraction over eight cents for each\r\nhundred quarts.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement will have the still further benefit of allowing the\r\nfarmer to remain at home and attend to his more important work, leaving\r\nthe detail of marketing to be done by a person especially qualified for\r\nit and therefore able to do it more cheaply than he could do it in\r\nperson. During the working season there will be enough rainy weather to\r\nallow the work of the stable, the barnyard, and the woodshed to be\r\nproperly attended to. There will of course be sudden showers and\r\noccasional storms, and other inconveniences, which will make the farmer\r\nregret at times that he lives at such a distance from his field work;\r\nbut he will find more than compensation in the advantages that come\r\nnaturally from living in a village.\r\n\r\nFor his wife and children the improvement will be absolute; and it will\r\nbe no slight argument in favor of the change, that both in doors and\r\nout of doors a better class of servants will be available, because of\r\nthe better life that can be offered. It will be easier to secure the\r\nservices of laborers who are married and who live in their own houses,\r\nand so avoid the serious annoyance to the household that attends the\r\nboarding of hired men.\r\n\r\nTo make this radical change in any farming neighborhood as at present\r\nconstituted, would be impracticable. It would probably take a generation\r\nto convince the farmers of a community of its advantages; it would cost\r\ntoo much, even if not entirely impracticable, to move the house and\r\nstables to the central point; and it would involve such a change of\r\nhabits of labor and of living as must necessarily be the work of time.\r\nHowever, if the principle commends itself to the leading men of the\r\nneighborhood, and especially to young men about to marry, the nucleus of\r\na village may be established, and sooner or later the present or the\r\ncoming generation will find a way to come into the fold.\r\n\r\nIf we assume that by this or some other means the more intelligent of\r\nthe young men are induced to remain farmers, it is interesting to\r\nconsider in what way their greater intelligence is to be made to tell on\r\ntheir work so as to secure the necessary improvement. It would not be\r\nunreasonable to suppose that young men of the class we have in mind,\r\nthose who now seek occupations which afford a better field for their\r\nintelligence, and who seek them because of their intelligence, would\r\nestablish such centres of discussion and interest in improved farming as\r\nwould not only mitigate the worthless gossip now so common at the\r\ncountry store, but would awaken a real enthusiasm in better processes\r\nand systems.\r\n\r\nNot only would there be this tendency toward improvement; but where\r\nfarmers are close neighbors, and are able to conduct their interests in\r\nsuch a way as to help each other, there would naturally grow up some\r\nsort of co-operative business. By the establishment of a butter-factory\r\nor cheese-factory, or by the common ownership of a milk-route, or where\r\ntobacco is grown by the undertaking of its manufacture as an employment\r\nfor winter, or by the raising of honey or of poultry, or by the\r\nestablishment of some valuable breed of live stock with a reputation for\r\nexcellence that will cause it to be sought for from abroad, or by some\r\nother combination, they would secure profitable business.\r\n\r\nOf course all the farmers in New England cannot within the next ten\r\nyears move into villages; but what is suggested is that the farmers of\r\nsome one community should try the experiment. Their success might induce\r\nothers to follow the example; and little by little, in proportion to the\r\npromise of a good result, more and more would seek the advantages which\r\nthe system would offer, so that sooner or later the benefits which are\r\nnow experienced in village life in Europe might be felt here in the\r\nhigher degree which greater intelligence and greater freedom would be\r\nsure to produce.\r\n\r\nWhile advancing these suggestions, with much confidence in their\r\npractical value, I would by no means confine the outlook for Eastern\r\nfarming to this single road to success. Co-operative industry may be\r\nlargely adopted among farmers living at some distance from each other.\r\nThe cheese-factory has become an institution. The better quality of the\r\nproduct when made in large quantities, and the better price that its\r\nquality and the improved system for marketing have secured, constitute\r\na very decided success in our agriculture. Butter-factories are coming\r\ninto vogue with a promise of equally good results.\r\n\r\nA very good substitute for the co-operative management of a milk route\r\nis in very general adoption throughout New England, where some single\r\nfarmer who devotes himself to selling milk buys the product of his\r\nneighbor's dairies for a certain fixed price, taking upon himself the\r\nlabor, the risk, and the profit of marketing. The co-operative breeding\r\nof live stock cannot as yet be said to have become well established, but\r\nits possibilities of success are considerable. A community can afford to\r\nbuy and keep a thorough-bred horse, or bull, or boar, or buck, which\r\nwould cost far too much for the means of a single owner, and thus\r\ngradually give to the stock of the whole neighborhood a superiority that\r\nwill secure it a wide-spread reputation and insure good prices. Let us\r\nkeep always in view the important principle of making two blades of\r\ngrass grow where but one grew before; but let us remit no effort which\r\nmay tend to make one blade worth what two were worth before.\r\n\r\nIncidentally, there may be combinations to secure good outlet drainage\r\nfor tracts of land belonging to different owners, and later a provision\r\nfor the general irrigation of these lands.\r\n\r\nIt is not to be hoped, that, either as a whole or in its details,\r\nagricultural improvement is to be advanced with any thing like a rush.\r\nFarmers are generally \"conservative\" in the worst sense of the term.\r\nThey have during the past generation adopted many improvements and\r\nmodifications in the methods of their work, the mere suggestion of which\r\nwould have been scouted by their fathers; but they are themselves as\r\nready as their fathers were to scout any further new suggestion, and it\r\nis only by iteration and reiteration that the shorter steps of tentative\r\nexperiment can be urged upon their acceptance.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing what is written above, the thought arises that the one\r\nimpression that it will surely produce will be that its writer fails to\r\nappreciate the better influences that cluster around the better class of\r\nfarmers' homes. Such an inference would be quite unjust. Knowing as I do\r\nthe intrinsic worth and the charming qualities of very many of these\r\nhouseholds, I appeal to the best of the thoughtful men and women whom\r\nthey include, to confirm my statement that they find many elements of\r\ntheir life to be pinching and hard, and that however admirable they may\r\nnow be, they would be in no way injured, but in many ways improved, by\r\nmore frequent intercourse with their equals, and especially with their\r\nbetters.\r\n\r\nThat the picture I have sketched of the average farmer's family is not\r\noverdrawn, I appeal to every country clergyman and physician to bear\r\nwitness. The truths suggested are patent to all. They are set forth in\r\nno spirit of hypercriticism, and with no other view than to help to\r\nameliorate the condition of those to whom they refer. Knowing the farmer\r\nmore intimately than does the average editor or orator, I am confident\r\nthat my estimate of his character and of his life will strike him as\r\nbeing more just, if not more honest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBY THE SAME AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n~A FARMER'S VACATION.~ Sketches of Travel in Europe; with a very complete\r\nAccount of the Drainage of the Great Haarlem Lake in Holland; Notes on\r\nDutch Farming; a Journey in Normandy and Brittany; and an Elaborate\r\nDescription of the Channel Islands,--their Agriculture, Social Customs,\r\nScenery, &c.
