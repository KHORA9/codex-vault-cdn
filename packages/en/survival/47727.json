Spottiswoode,\r\n  New-Street-Square.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nA considerable interest has been excited in the Horticultural world by\r\nthe experiments of T. A. Knight, Esq. on the culture of the PINE APPLE.\r\nOur _object_ is to add our efforts to those of that eminent\r\nHorticulturist, in promoting the culture of that king of fruits.\r\n\r\nThe _means_ which we consider as most likely to attain our object, is\r\nthe bringing together accounts of all the different modes of treating\r\nthat Plant, which have hitherto been adopted in Europe; and the\r\n_sources_ from which we have drawn the means, are the different\r\n_publications_ which have appeared on the Pine Apple, and our own\r\n_observations_ on its management, by those Gardeners who are its most\r\nsuccessful cultivators.\r\n\r\nThe British publications which treat exclusively, or principally, of the\r\nPine Apple, are:\r\n\r\n1767. _John Giles_, of Lewisham. A Method of raising Pines and Melons,\r\n8vo.\r\n\r\n1769. _Adam Taylor_, Gardener at Devizes, in Wiltshire. A Treatise on\r\nthe Ananas and on Melons, 8vo.\r\n\r\n1779. _William Speechly_, Gardener to the Duke of Portland, at Welbeck,\r\nin Nottinghamshire. A Treatise on the culture of the Pine Apple, and the\r\nmanagement of the Hot-house, &c. 8vo.\r\n\r\n1808. _William Griffin_, Gardener to J. C. Girardot, Esq. at Kelham,\r\nnear Nottingham. A Treatise on the culture of the Pine Apple, 8vo.\r\n\r\n1818. _Thomas Baldwin_, Gardener to the Marquis of Hertford, at Ragley,\r\nin Warwickshire. A Treatise on the culture of the Ananas, &c. 12mo.\r\n\r\nThe Authors who have treated on the Pine Apple, as a part of their\r\ngeneral subject, include nearly all those who have written on\r\nHorticulture since the commencement of the 18th century; the principal\r\nare, Bradley, Miller, Justice, Abercrombie, M’Phail, and Nicol, in their\r\nrespective works; and T. A. Knight, Esq., and Peter Marsland, Esq., in\r\nthe Transactions of the London and Caledonian Horticultural Societies.\r\n\r\nThe Foreign publications on the Pine Apple are few, and of little value;\r\nbecause the Continental Gardeners have never been very successful in its\r\nculture. Professor Thouin and M. Bosc, are the principal French Authors\r\nwho have noticed the subject, and this only in general works, such as\r\nRosier’s Dictionary, &c. Kirchner is almost the only German writer who\r\nhas written on this fruit, in his _Practische Anleitung für\r\nGartenkunst_, published in 1796, and devoted more particularly to the\r\nculture of the Pine and the Grape. Some other foreign tracts on the\r\nsubject in the Banksian Library are merely translations from La Cours\r\nchapter on the subject, and from English authors.\r\n\r\nThe most eminent cultivators of the Pine Apple in England, at the\r\npresent time, are, Mr. Thomas Baldwin, Gardener to the Marquis of\r\nHertford, at Ragley, in Warwickshire; Mr. William Griffin, Gardener to\r\nSamuel Smith, Esq., at Woodhall Park, Hertfordshire; William Townsend\r\nAiton, Esq. Gardener to the King, at Kensington; Mr. James Andrews,\r\nCommercial Gardener, Lambeth; and Mr. Isaac Oldacre, Gardener to Lady\r\nBanks, at Springrove, Middlesex.\r\n\r\nA number of other gardeners might be mentioned, as excelling in the\r\nculture of this fruit; but the above have been first-rate cultivators\r\nfor several years.\r\n\r\nOn the Continent the Pine Apple is cultivated most extensively in\r\nRussia; it occurs but seldom in France or Germany; and only in a few\r\ngardens in Italy. It has happened to us to have visited the principal\r\nContinental Gardens, as well as the English ones alluded to above, and\r\nvarious others; and we mention this to justify the extension of our\r\nremarks, not only to domestic, but foreign practices; and to account for\r\nour not confining ourselves merely to what is contained in books, but\r\ndiscussing also the modes of culture actually practised in different\r\ngardens. We shall first notice the introduction of the Pine Apple into\r\nEurope, and next the different varieties in cultivation; we shall then\r\nglance at the Continental practices, and finally detail those of our own\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _This Day is published_,\r\n\r\n  By Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, & Brown, London,\r\n\r\n  An ENCYCLOPÆDIA of GARDENING;\r\n\r\n  Comprising the Theory and Practice of Horticulture, Floriculture,\r\n  Arboriculture, and Landscape Gardening; including all the latest\r\n  Improvements, a general History of Gardening in all Countries; and a\r\n  Statistical View of its present State, with Suggestions for its\r\n  future Progress, in the British Isles.\r\n\r\n  By J. C. LOUDON, F.L.S. H.S. &c.,\r\n\r\n  Author of “A Treatise on forming and improving Country Residences.”\r\n\r\n  Complete, in One large Volume, 8vo. of 1500 Pages, closely printed,\r\n  with Six Hundred Engravings on Wood, Price £2. 10s.\r\n\r\n  This Work claims the Attention of the Public:\r\n\r\n  1. By the comprehensiveness of its plan, by which, for the first\r\n  time, every part of the subject of Gardening is brought together,\r\n  and presented in one systematic whole.\r\n\r\n  2. By its being the only work which contains all the modern\r\n  improvements in Gardening, foreign as well as domestic.\r\n\r\n  3. By the addition of a _Kalendarial Index_, by which the practical\r\n  part of the work may be consulted monthly, as the operations are to\r\n  be performed; and a copious _General Index_, by which the whole may\r\n  be consulted alphabetically. Thus the work will serve as a\r\n  _Gardener’s Kalendar_, and _Gardener’s Dictionary_: both, it is\r\n  confidently hoped, far more complete than any hitherto presented to\r\n  the public.\r\n\r\n  By means of a copious page, by condensed descriptive tables of\r\n  fruits, culinary vegetables, and flowers, and by the local\r\n  introduction of such illustrative engravings as greatly shorten the\r\n  necessity of verbal description, this immense body of matter has\r\n  been comprised in one thick volume.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

I.\r\n\r\nOF THE PINE APPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Its Culture in the West and East Indies.--Introduction to\r\n  Holland.--To England._\r\n\r\nThe Pine Apple is the Bromelia Ananas of Linneus; of the artificial\r\nclass and order Hexandria Monogynia; and of the natural order of\r\nJussieu, Bromeleæ. The generic name was originally Ananas, from Nana,\r\nits common name in the Brazils; and the Queen Pine is named the Ananas\r\nOvata, in the earlier editions of Miller’s Dictionary; but Linneus\r\nchanged it to Bromelia, in memory of Olaus Bromel, a Swedish naturalist,\r\nand included under it the Karatas, or Wild Pine, till then considered a\r\ndistinct genus. The English name of Pine Apple appears to have taken\r\nits rise from the resemblance of the fruit to the cone of some species\r\nof the Pine tree.\r\n\r\nThere are twelve species of Bromelia, described by Persoon; the fruit of\r\nall which may be considered edible, and is occasionally made use of by\r\nthe natives. Six of these species are naturalized in the West Indies;\r\nand the rest are found wild in Chili, Peru, and other parts of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe Bromelia Ananas is the only species in general cultivation; it is\r\ncultivated abundantly in both the Indies, and in China. It is said to\r\ngrow wild in Africa; but Linneus ascribes it to New Spain and Surinam;\r\nand Acosta (_Histoire Naturelle des Indes_,) says, it was first sent\r\nfrom the province of Santa Croce, in Brazil, into the West, and\r\nafterwards into the East Indies and China. Persoon considers it as a\r\nnative of South America; and Baron Humboldt and the Prince Maximilian\r\nfound it in the Caraccas, in the Brazils.\r\n\r\nWhichever way it was introduced from South America to the West Indies,\r\nits culture in these islands, and particularly in Jamaica, has been\r\ncarried on for an unknown length of time. It is vulgarly supposed in\r\nthis country, that it grows wild there; but, from the best information\r\nwhich we have been able to collect, the true Ananas is only cultivated\r\nin gardens, or grounds under spade culture; and there much in the same\r\nway as cabbages are in this country, and produces its fruit in from\r\nfifteen to eighteen months after planting the crown. The common weight\r\nof the fruit is from half a pound to three pounds; and it abounds\r\nchiefly in the dry season. In the rainy season, which includes nearly\r\nhalf the year, ripe Pine Apples are more scarce in the gardens of\r\nJamaica than in the hot-houses of England.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of Calcutta it is cultivated in the same manner as\r\nin Jamaica, and, when liberally supplied with water, by a system of\r\nsurface-irrigation, the first is said to attain a large size, and to be\r\nin season most months of the year.\r\n\r\nThe first attempts to cultivate the Pine Apple in Europe seem to have\r\nbeen made about the end of the seventeenth century, by M. Le Cour (or\r\n_La Court_, as written by Collinson), a wealthy Flemish merchant, who\r\nhad a fine garden at Drieoeck, near Leyden. Of this garden he published\r\nan account in 1732, and died in 1737.\r\n\r\nIt was visited by Miller and Justice, who speak of its proprietor as one\r\nof the greatest encouragers of gardening in his time; of having curious\r\nwalls and hot-houses; and as being the first person who succeeded in\r\ncultivating the Pine Apple. It was from him, Miller observes,\r\n(_Dictionary_, Art. _Bromelia_,) that our gardens were first supplied,\r\nthrough Sir Matthew Decker, of Richmond, in the year 1719; though, as a\r\nbotanic plant, it had been introduced so far back as 1690, by Mr.\r\nBentick, afterwards Earl of Portsmouth.\r\n\r\n“When I say,” observes Mr. Cowel of Hoxton, in his Curious and\r\nProfitable Gardener, Lon. 1730, p. 27. “that the first Pine Apples that\r\nwere cultivated in England, were in Sir Matthew Decker’s gardens at\r\nRichmond, I mean the first that were cultivated with success, were in\r\nthose gardens; for long before we had plants of them brought to us, but\r\nhad not before that time conveniences for bringing them to fruit, or\r\neven of keeping the plants alive.”\r\n\r\n“The Pine Apple,” he adds, in the same page, “is now (1730) found in\r\nalmost every curious garden.”\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Ananas was sent to Europe, and especially to Holland,\r\nas a preserve, for many years before the Ananas plant was introduced.\r\n\r\nThat it found its way even to England in this state, so early as the\r\nsixteenth century, is evident from what Lord Bacon says of it in his\r\nEssay on Colonies; and also from a picture in the possession of the Earl\r\nof Waldegrave, representing Charles II. in a garden, and Rose, the royal\r\ngardener, presenting his Majesty with a Pine Apple. This picture, Lord\r\nWalpole informs us, was bequeathed by Mr. London, who was Rose’s\r\napprentice, to the Rev. Mr. Pennicott, of Thames Ditton, by whom it was\r\npresented to himself. It does not appear, however, that the Pine was\r\ncultivated either by Rose or London, otherwise it would certainly have\r\nbeen noticed in the publications, which, if not written by, at least\r\npassed under the name, and received the sanction of London and Wise;\r\nand also of Evelyn, Ray, Rea, and other gardening writers of these\r\ntimes. In short, it is evident from Ray’s letters, that the idea of\r\nheating green-houses by fire was quite new in 1684, and first adopted by\r\nMr. Watts, gardener, to the apothecaries at Chelsea in that year; and\r\nMiller states, (_Dict._ Art. _Tan_,) that there were very few tan-beds\r\nused in England before the year 1719. The Pine Apple, therefore, could\r\nnot be cultivated in the seventeenth century in England.\r\n\r\nOf late years the Pine Apple has been sent to England in abundance,\r\nattached to the entire plant, and a cargo has arrived from Providence\r\nIsland, in the Bermudas, in six weeks. This facility of cultivation, and\r\ntheir more general culture, has greatly lessened their price, and\r\nrendered them common. They are sold in fruit-stands in the London\r\nstreets, in one or two places, during the summer months; and\r\nmoderate-sized fruit may be had from half-a-crown to a crown each; or at\r\ntwo shillings a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nOF THE VARIETIES OF THE PINE APPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the Pine Apple, as of most other fruits that have been long in\r\ncultivation, there are many varieties. The principal part of those\r\ncultivated in this country have been obtained from the West India\r\nislands; but some also have been raised in this country from seed.\r\n\r\nSpeechly states, that, in the year 1768, he raised seventy plants from\r\nseeds that were sent to the Duke of Portland from the West Indies, most\r\nof which varied distinctly either in the leaves or fruit, but the\r\nquality of the latter was very inferior.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most esteemed varieties in present cultivation are:\r\n\r\n1. _The Old Queen._ Fruit oval-shaped, and of a gold colour. Esteemed\r\nthe hardiest kind, and fruited in fifteen or eighteen months. The fruit\r\ngrows to a large size, often weighing from three to four pounds. It is\r\nmuch more certain of shewing fruit at a proper age and season than most\r\nof the other sorts, and has a just preference in most hot-houses.\r\n\r\n2. _Ripley’s New Queen._ A sub-variety of the _Old Queen_, with a large\r\nelegant fruit; fruited also in an equally short period.\r\n\r\n3. _Welbeck Seedling_; fruit small, generally broader at the head than\r\nat the base; of a pale yellow, or sulphur colour, with very flat pips;\r\nflesh white and tender, rich in flavour, with less acidity than is found\r\nin most other pines. _Hort. Trans._ iv. 213.\r\n\r\n4. _Pyramidal_, or _Brown Sugar-loaf_. Cone-shaped, and dark coloured\r\ntill it ripens; the leaves brownish, the flesh yellow.\r\n\r\n5. _Prickly Striped Sugar-loaf._ Cone-shaped, the fruit of a golden\r\ncolour, the leaves striped with black or purple lines.\r\n\r\n6. _Smooth Striped Sugar-loaf_; similar to the above, but the leaves not\r\nprickly.\r\n\r\n7. _Havannah._ Tankard-shaped; dark coloured till it ripens.\r\n\r\n8. _Montserrat._ The leaves of a dark brown, inclining to purple in the\r\ninside; fruit middle-sized and tun-shaped, and the pips or protuberances\r\nof the fruit larger and flatter than in the other kinds.\r\n\r\n9. _King Pine_, or _Shining Green_. The leaves of a grass-green, with\r\nfew prickles, the pulp hard and rather stringy, but of good flavor when\r\nripe.\r\n\r\n10. _Green_, or _St. Vincent’s Pine_. A rare variety; when ripe the\r\nfruit is of an olive hue, middle-sized, and pyramidical.\r\n\r\n11. _Black Antigua._ The fruit is shaped like the frustum of a pyramid:\r\nleaves of a brownish tinge, and drooping at the extremities, with strong\r\nprickles, thinly scattered. The pips of the fruit are large, often an\r\ninch over; and it attains a large size, weighing from three to four\r\npounds. It is of a dark colour till it ripens; very juicy, and high\r\nflavoured.\r\n\r\n12. _Black Jamaica._ The fruit is large, and the plant similar in\r\ncharacter and habits to the above.\r\n\r\n13. _Providence Pine._ There are two varieties, the white and green; the\r\nfruit is larger than that of any of the kinds cultivated in this\r\ncountry; the form inclining to pyramidical; the colour, at first,\r\nbrownish grey, but, when mature, of a pale yellow. The flesh yellow and\r\nmelting, abounding with quick lively juice. Speechly produced in the\r\ngardens at Welbeck, in 1794, a fruit that weighed five pounds and a\r\nquarter, or eighty-four ounces, and from a plant that was not a large\r\none. Griffin had, in 1803, two plants placed under his care, which\r\nfruited in July 1804; the fruit of one plant weighing _seven pounds two\r\nounces_, and the other _nine pounds three ounces_, avoirdupois. This\r\nsort, and the two preceding, require generally three years, and\r\nsometimes four or five, to produce their fruit.\r\n\r\n14. _Blood-red_; fruit equal in bulk at both ends. Pips of moderate\r\nsize; colour brick-red; flesh white and opaque; leaves of a changeable\r\nhue; the flavor of the fruit being inferior to that of most others; this\r\nis to be considered merely as a curious variety. _Hort. Trans._ iv. 214.\r\n\r\n15. _Silver-striped Queen._ Leaves beautifully striped with white,\r\nyellow, and red; but the plant, though elegant, is a reluctant fruiter.\r\n\r\n16. _Variegated-leaved Pines._ Besides the _Striped-leaved Queen_, there\r\nare several sorts with beautifully varied leaves and fruits; but in\r\ngeneral they are tardy in fruiting, and more to be considered as\r\nornamental than as useful varieties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo these may be added, as sorts not generally known, or of inferior\r\nvalue:\r\n\r\n  The _Smooth Pine_. Miller.\r\n  The _Smooth Long Narrow-leaved Pine_. Ibid.\r\n  The _Grunda Pine_. Ibid.\r\n  The _Bogwarp Pine_. Ibid.\r\n  The _Surinam Pine_. Ibid.\r\n  The _Antigua Queen_. Speechly.\r\n  The _Green Providence_, or _Old Providence_, from one of the Bermuda\r\n  islands of that name.\r\n\r\n_New Sorts._ Pine plants are frequently imported from the West India\r\nislands, and in this case generally bear their names. In general,\r\nhowever, these plants are far inferior, both as to kinds and condition,\r\nto those grown, and to be procured from nurserymen in this country. They\r\nare generally infested with the bug, and very uncertain in their time\r\nof fruiting, as well as to its flavor. If these were to be enumerated,\r\nthe list of pines known in this country would amount to upwards of forty\r\nsorts. Specimens of above thirty sorts are grown in the gardens of Mr.\r\nGunter, at Earl’scourt.\r\n\r\nThe Pine Apple, as every gardener knows, is propagated in the same\r\nmanner by all those who grow it; that is, by that singular production in\r\nwhich the fruit terminates, called a crown, and by suckers; these are\r\nplanted in small pots, or in beds of rotten tan, earth, or dung, at\r\nfirst, and shifted in regular gradation into pots of different sizes, at\r\nthe discretion of the cultivator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN MODES OF CULTIVATING THE PINE APPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Culture of the Pine Apple in Holland,--France,--Germany,--Italy, &c._\r\n\r\nThe horticulture of the continent is, in general, copied from that of\r\nHolland, as was our culture, and that of every other country two\r\ncenturies ago. Excepting in Holland, therefore, the English gardener\r\nwill find very little to learn in other countries; but it is worth while\r\nto know how little is to be known in one quarter, that we may be the\r\nmore assiduous in our attention to such quarters as are likely to\r\nfurnish us with information.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, we shall take a short view of the culture of the Pine\r\nApple in the principal parts of the Continent.\r\n\r\nWhether Le Cour was the first who imported Pine plants from the West\r\nIndies, is less certain than that he was the first to attempt their\r\nculture with success. Professor Bradley, in his General Treatise of\r\nHusbandry and Gardening for July 1724, p. 206. gives a description of\r\nthe Pine Apple, and the introduction of it into Holland by Mr. Le Cour.\r\nHe says, that there were in the Amsterdam gardens about two hundred\r\nplants, chiefly from Surinam and Curaçao, but some from the Dutch\r\nfactories in the East Indies, which were in good health; but the art of\r\nbringing them to fruit was not known till Mr. Le Cour took them in hand.\r\nMiller says, that after a great many trials, with little or no success,\r\nMr. Le Cour did at length hit upon a proper degree of heat and\r\nmanagement, so as to produce fruit equally good (though not so large),\r\nas that which is produced in the West Indies. About the year 1737, the\r\nyear before his death, Mr. Le Cour published a quarto volume in Dutch,\r\ncontaining the result of his observations on gardens, trees, and\r\nflowers; with explanatory descriptions of his stoves.\r\n\r\nFrom this work, and from the statements of Professor Bradley, (_Treatise\r\non Husbandry and Gardening, for June 1724_, p. 161.) we learn that Le\r\nCour’s mode of treating the Pine plant was very similar to that adopted\r\nat Sir Matthew Decker’s garden at Richmond, to be afterwards described;\r\nbut we shall give this gentleman’s practice, as related by himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple by Mr. Le Cour in the beginning of the\r\n  18th century, at Drieoeck, near Leyden._\r\n\r\nI distinguish, he says, three different species of Pine Apple; the first\r\nand best has green leaves, garnished with fine prickles, fruit of which\r\nI have had seven inches high, and thirteen inches in circumference; this\r\nsort, if it is kept cool before it shows fruit, and then advances slowly\r\nby somewhat more heat, grows larger and more pointed than that which has\r\nbeen kept warmer and in a growing state during winter. The leaves of the\r\nsecond sort are larger and broader, of a darker green mixed with red; it\r\ndoes not produce fruit of so large a size, but its knobs are broader and\r\nlarger, yet flatter; the unripe fruit being of a reddish brown, and when\r\nripe of a deep yellow, with brownish yellow spots on the knobs; this\r\nsort has not so pleasant a taste as the first, which, when unripe, is of\r\na darker green, and when ripe, with lighter yellow knobs, on which\r\naccount I cultivate chiefly the following sort.\r\n\r\nThis is called the Smooth Ananas, on account of its being without\r\nprickles, but the ends of the leaves grow longer, narrower, and more\r\nupright: the fruit is smaller. The Ananas cannot bear the cold of our\r\nwinter, and must have in summer a more permanent warmth and less change\r\nin the winter than we commonly have in our climate; and must therefore\r\nnot only be put during the winter into stoves, but even during the\r\nsummer under glass frames, and the pots placed in a hot-bed of tan.\r\nHowever, it is with these plants, as it is with all others from a warmer\r\nclimate; when they by degrees have been accustomed to our colder\r\nclimate, they become more hardy, and can bear more cold and change of\r\nweather, and therefore produce better fruit than those which are sent to\r\nus from abroad and have been reared in a warmer country more congenial\r\nto their nature. It is therefore necessary that we should try to get\r\nplants that have already been accustomed to our country, by propagation\r\nfrom suckers for a number of years, for in that case they may be reared\r\nwith very little trouble.\r\n\r\nThe most convenient time to take away the suckers is from the middle of\r\nJune to the end of the month. Both suckers and crowns must be put in\r\nsandy earth in little pots, as in this manner they strike their roots\r\nbest; but when the plants have grown larger, they must be transplanted\r\nin the following year in richer and less sandy earth, and in larger\r\npots, care being taken that the earth is not loosened from the roots in\r\nshifting them. The most convenient time for transplanting them is in\r\nMarch, when the plants must be taken from the hot-house and put in a bed\r\nof earth under a frame. Care must be taken in shifting them into other\r\npots, to make the earth adhere well to the roots, and to water them well\r\nafterwards, and not to use too large pots, as they take up more room,\r\nare not so easily handled, and are less proper for growing large fruit\r\nthan those of a moderate size; the most convenient pots for\r\ntransplanting are ten inches in diameter within the rim, seven inches at\r\nbottom, and ten and a half inches deep.\r\n\r\nThe plants, when growing, commonly require a great deal of water, and\r\nmore when they set their fruit. They should then be watered frequently\r\nall over their leaves. Afterwards they must be treated with more\r\ncaution, and be less watered; for too much water would be injurious\r\nabout the time of the ripening of the fruit, which would get watery, and\r\nof a transparent greenish yellow, and be of inferior taste and smell.\r\nToo little water dries them up, and makes the _marrow_ perish in the\r\nleaves, the first signs of which are, when you hold the green leaves\r\ntowards the light, you will perceive them speckled with yellowish spots.\r\nTo produce proper fruit, the plant of a sucker or crown must have grown\r\nwell and bulky, at least for three years; the first sign of setting\r\nfruit is, that its leaves spread a little, and the plant opens a little\r\nin the heart where the fruit soon shews itself like the head of a large\r\nnail. As the fruit and stalk grow higher, the fruit grows rounder, with\r\npointed little leaves like thistles, on some reddish, and on others\r\nwhitish spreading leaves. After the fruit has grown about a month, and\r\nis of the size of a walnut, there appears out of each knob a\r\nthree-leaved pointed little flower, which, in the Common Ananas, is of a\r\npale blue colour; on the Red Ananas, deep blue; and on the third sort,\r\nthe Smooth Ananas, almost violet. This flower does not fall off with the\r\nincrease of the fruit, but shrivels up, and leaves some visible remains\r\nbehind when the fruit has attained its full maturity.\r\n\r\nThe time, from the beginning of the fruit to its perfect maturity,\r\ncannot be limited to a certain number of days and weeks, since it\r\ndepends very much on the weather of two summers following. During the\r\nspring, when the plants are in the hot-house, a very natural growth may\r\nbe obtained by heating the stove, and by the sun shining at right angles\r\non the glass, which growth may be continued during the summer. In autumn\r\nthis cannot be the case, because the sun has less power, and the rains\r\ncommon to that season diminish it still more; therefore, from December\r\nat latest, more and more artificial heat must be given to the plants,\r\nuntil they begin in the middle of February, or at farthest in the\r\nbeginning of March, to show their fruit, which then, with good summer\r\nweather and proper treatment, will attain to maturity in the beginning\r\nof July, and thus are five months ripening; the fruit, which shows\r\nitself in the beginning of March, wants at least a fortnight more to\r\nripen; that which appears in the middle of March wants a month more, and\r\nconsequently is six months coming to maturity; that which shows itself\r\nin April wants still more, and seldom becomes so ripe as to obtain its\r\nproper taste and smell. The agreeable smell which the ripe Ananas emits\r\non lifting up the sashes, is the surest proof of maturity: it is then of\r\na deep yellow, and the knobs have brownish yellow spots.\r\n\r\nThe time for removing the plants from the bark bed into the flued pit,\r\nand hence again into the bark bed, cannot be fixed, as this depends on\r\nthe weather, and on the length of summer or winter. In some years I\r\nhave been obliged to put them in a hot-house in September, and keep them\r\nthere until April; but in common years they are moved into the hot-house\r\non the 10th or 12th of October, and from thence again into the hot-bed\r\nof tan in the middle of March. The flues must be dried by heating them\r\nbefore the plants are brought into the hot-house, not only to remove the\r\ndamp which, on the first heating, is powerful and injurious, but also to\r\ndiscover whether there are any openings by which the smoke may escape\r\ninto the hot-house, for they must be carefully stopped up. This pit or\r\nwintering house may be of any convenient length or breadth; supposing\r\ntwo joined together, then the fire flues (fig. 1. a. a.) may be formed\r\nat the extreme ends; the smoke may first enter and fill a vault of the\r\nwhole width and length of the pit (b.); it may afterwards enter a flue\r\n(c. c.) and pass round the pit, and then out by a chimney in the back\r\nwall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1]\r\n\r\nThe sashes of the pits at Drieoeck are six feet wide, and three and\r\na-half feet broad, and each has a cover of boards which are raised up\r\nand let down by means of cords and pullies, the better to retain the\r\nheat in the winter months (fig. 2.) Their slope forms an angle, with the\r\nhorizon of about twenty degrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2]\r\n\r\nIn these pits a boarded stage is formed, on which the plants are set, so\r\nas to be almost touching the glass during winter; during summer a bed of\r\ntan is substituted for the boarded stage, and no fire-heat is applied,\r\nbut the plants plunged in the tan.\r\n\r\nThe following is the general course of temperature aimed at:--\r\n\r\nTemperature during the first fourteen days in October, when the plants\r\nare removed from the hot-beds of bark to the stages in the flued pits,\r\n87° Fah.\r\n\r\nTemperature from this time till the 20th of the January following, from\r\n55° to 64°.\r\n\r\nTemperature from January to March not under 55°. Lowest degree\r\nadmissible during winter 42°. Highest summer heat 105°.\r\n\r\nTemperature of the bark hot-beds, in which the plants are placed to\r\nfruit when air is given, 103°.\r\n\r\nOrdinary summer heat for the fruiting plants 96°.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn Holland and Flanders, at the present day, the Pine Apple is never\r\ngrown in any other manner than in pits and hot-beds. The crowns and\r\nsuckers are struck and forwarded, from three to six, or nine months, in\r\nhot-beds, and afterwards removed to pits. These pits differ from ours in\r\nbeing rather steeper in the roof, and generally the fruiting pits have a\r\npassage at the back, with a flue against the back wall, and an entrance\r\ndoor to the passage at one end. In some the passage and flue are in\r\nfront, and in others a passage and flue are conducted round the house,\r\nleaving the pit in the middle; but this is rather an uncommon form, and\r\nchiefly to be met with in pits or stoves for ornamental plants. The fuel\r\nin general use is peat, and the glass is well covered with boards and\r\nmatting or canvas or thatch every night after sun-set, excepting in the\r\nwarmest part of the season.\r\n\r\nThe soil used by the Dutch is good garden earth, mixed with a third part\r\nof well-rotten hot-bed dung, or cow dung, and a sufficient quantity of\r\nsand to render it free and pervious to moisture. The gardeners there\r\nare by no means so particular in the article of soil, as many are in\r\nthis country; their object seems to be to make it rich and free; without\r\nbeing very anxious as to employing virgin soil only, or any particular\r\nkind of dung. They generally, however, keep the mixture some time in\r\nheaps, and turn it over once or twice before using it. At the same time\r\nwe have seen them shifting Pines, and using a black rich earth newly dug\r\nout of an adjoining plot of turnips; only mixing it with a little rotten\r\ndung and white sand.\r\n\r\nThey shift their plants in spring, and refresh the surfaces of the pots\r\nin autumn, and they seem on the whole to fruit them in larger pots than\r\nwe do; but they leave off shifting them nine or ten months before the\r\nfruit is expected to appear, wishing to have the pots filled with roots\r\nat this crisis. They seldom fruit a crown plant under two years, and\r\nmore generally three, from the time it is taken from the fruit; large\r\nsuckers they fruit earlier, according to their size when taken off the\r\nmother plant; some which come out from near the bottom of the stem they\r\nearth up, and do not take off at all. These come early into fruit, but\r\nit is not large.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple in Germany._\r\n\r\nThe Germans took their horticulture from the Dutch, as they did their\r\nlandscape gardening from the French. They seem to have tried the\r\nculture of the Pine Apple almost immediately after its introduction to\r\nHolland; for, according to Beckmann, it was ripened by Dr. Kaltschmidt\r\nat Breslaw in 1702, who sent some fruit to the Imperial Court; but he\r\nstates also that its culture was first attempted by Baron Munchausen, a\r\ngreat encourager of gardening, and a botanist who had a fine demesne and\r\ngarden at Schwobber, near Hamelin, in Westphalia. From the account of\r\nthese gardens in the _Neuremberg Hesperides_, they appear to have been\r\ngrown both in pits, and on stages in larger houses.\r\n\r\nThe king of Prussia grew the Pine Apple extensively at Potsdam; he\r\nfollowed the Dutch manner in every thing, and had a gardener from that\r\ncountry who attended exclusively to the forcing department at Sans\r\nSouci. The quantity of glass there was greater than any where else in\r\nGermany: the whole was kept in high order and good culture for many\r\nyears; but after the king’s death, in 1786, it soon fell into neglect;\r\nthe glass of most of the peach-houses and vineries was removed or\r\ndestroyed; the Pine plants were neglected and diminished in numbers,\r\nfrom time to time. In 1813 the royal gardens at Sans Souci contained\r\nonly about two dozen of Pine plants, which were kept in a lofty opaque\r\nroofed conservatory, and these, as may be easily imagined, were by no\r\nmeans in a thriving condition.\r\n\r\nBefore the French Revolution, the Pine Apple was cultivated at most of\r\nthe court gardens in Germany; but in the year 1814, there were very few\r\nin the empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple in Russia._\r\n\r\nThe Pine Apple is extensively cultivated in the imperial gardens in the\r\nneighbourhood of Petersburg and Moscow, and also in those of a few of\r\nthe greatest nobility and mercantile men adjoining those cities. Nothing\r\ncan be more wonderful than to contemplate the resources by which this\r\nplant, requiring not less than from 50 to 70 degrees of heat at all\r\ntimes of the year, is preserved in existence through a winter of seven\r\nmonths, during the whole of which the ground is covered with snow, and\r\nFahrenheit’s thermometer, often for weeks together, at 20° below Zero.\r\n\r\nThe head gardeners of the emperor, and the great nobles of Russia, are,\r\nfor the greater part, Britons; and the sort of houses they erect, and\r\nthe mode of culture they follow, is as nearly as circumstances will\r\nadmit, those of Speechly or Nicol.\r\n\r\nThe culture of the grape is, to a certain extent, combined with that of\r\nthe Pine Apple; the former is trained on the rafters, and the latter\r\ngrown in a pit, surrounded by flues and a path. In addition to the\r\nflues, many of the fruiting-houses have stoves built in them, on the\r\nGerman construction, which are used in the most severe weather.\r\nSometimes there is a double roof of glass; but more generally the roof,\r\nends, and fronts, are covered with boards; which not only prevents the\r\nweight of sudden falls of snow from breaking the glass, but by admitting\r\nof a coating of snow over them, prevents, in a considerable degree, the\r\ninternal heat from escaping. This covering, or a covering of mats or\r\ncanvass, as practised near Moscow, and from which the snow is raked off\r\nas fast as it falls, is sometimes kept on night and day for three months\r\ntogether. The plants being all the while in a dormant state, it is\r\nremarkable how little they suffer.\r\n\r\nThe best ranges of hot-houses in the neighbourhood of Petersburg, have\r\nbeen imported there from Leith, or London. At Moscow, where the same\r\nfacility of importation is not afforded, they are constructed on the\r\nspot, in a very rude manner; in the best of them, the interstices\r\nbetween the sashes and rafters are so large, that they have to be\r\nstuffed with moss. Still it is astonishing how well the Pine Apple is\r\npreserved in them through a long winter, and what excellent peaches and\r\ngrapes they produce during summer. The cause seems to be owing to the\r\ngreat care and skill of the gardeners, in keeping the plants in a\r\ndormant state, when there is but little light; and in applying\r\npowerfully all the agents of growth and culture, during the short, but\r\nwarm Russian summer.\r\n\r\nThere are some German gardeners in Russia, who cultivate the Pine Apple\r\nin pits as in Holland; and crowns and suckers are forwarded in this way\r\nby them, and also by the British gardeners settled in that country.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple in France._\r\n\r\nThe culture of the Pine Apple does not appear to have been commenced in\r\nFrance till after the middle of the eighteenth century, and then only in\r\nthe royal gardens at Versailles, in those of the Duke of Orleans at\r\nMousseaux, and one or two others. It has never been cultivated by above\r\na dozen persons in that country; nor is it grown by so great a number at\r\nthe present time. The best are in the garden of M. Boursault, within the\r\nboundary of Paris; and the next those of the king at Trianon and\r\nVersailles, and of the banker Lafitte, at his country-seat, a few\r\nleagues from the capital.\r\n\r\nM. Boursault grows them in low houses, which may be termed pits, being\r\nwithout glass in the front or ends; the plants are plunged in tan, and\r\nkept as near the glass as possible; and the soil used is good garden\r\nearth, or free soil (_terre-franche_), with about half its bulk of\r\n_poudrette_, or desiccated nightsoil. M. Boursault tried them formerly\r\nin the _poudrette_ alone, but found they did not succeed so well as when\r\na smaller quantity was used. He produces fruit from half a pound to two\r\npounds in weight, and it is said of a good flavour.\r\n\r\nRosier states, that M. Mallet, a curious horticulturist, grew ananas in\r\na peculiarly constructed frame of his own invention (fig. 3.); but we\r\ncould see none of these frames in use in any way, and were informed by\r\ndifferent persons, that they were too expensive in their first cost to\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3]\r\n\r\nThe Pine plants in the royal gardens, did not appear to us so well\r\ncultivated as those of M. Boursault; they were very much drawn, and\r\nseemed too sparingly watered. All the Pine plants which we have seen in\r\nFrance, and also in Italy, had this yellow sickly appearance; and the\r\nfruit produced was universally of small size; one of three pips is\r\nthought worth presenting to table. It is certainly a very singular fact,\r\nand not hitherto explained, that the Pine plant in a climate where it\r\ngets more light than in Germany, Britain, or Russia, should yet be less\r\ngreen than in those countries. Had the reverse been the case, the\r\ncircumstance would not have been surprising; but that more green should\r\nbe produced in the northern hemisphere, and under the torrid zone, than\r\nunder what might be considered as a happy medium between two extremes,\r\nis astonishing, and leads to a suspicion of deficiency of management.\r\nThe cause seems referable to deficiency of water, and too great heat\r\nduring night; for during day they have the precaution to shade them from\r\nthe sun’s direct influence.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. V.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple in Italy._\r\n\r\nThe Pine Apple was grown in Italy before the revolution, by the Pope, at\r\nNaples, and by the king of Sardinia, at Turin. The late king of Sardinia\r\nsent his gardener to England, to study the culture of this fruit; and he\r\nreturned and published in 1777, a pamphlet on the subject. He recommends\r\nit to be grown in pits, much the same as those of the Dutch, but without\r\nflues, which is still the general practice in Italy. After the\r\npossession of Piedmont by the French, the royal palaces and gardens were\r\nneglected, and in 1819, when we saw them, they were not restored.\r\n\r\nAt the royal gardens, and those of Prince Leopold, at Portici, near\r\nNaples, a few Pines are grown in pits, by two German gardeners, that of\r\nPrince Leopold, an intelligent man and a good botanist; but the plants,\r\nnotwithstanding the fine climate, are etiolated, slender, and pale, with\r\nvery small fruit. The pits were entirely sunk in the ground, narrow, and\r\nwithout flues, and they were shaded in the day-time with a net. It\r\nappeared to us, that they were much too tenderly treated; if uncovered\r\nin the night-time, or planted in the open garden, and left exposed all\r\nthe summer, and covered with double glass frames during winter, without\r\nany fire heat; but, if occasion required, surrounded by linings of dung,\r\nwe have no doubt they would succeed much better.\r\n\r\nAt Caserta, a royal palace about eighteen miles from Naples, the Pine\r\nApple is grown in a style much superior. The gardens and grounds there,\r\nwere laid out by M. Græffer, a German gardener, who was formerly a\r\npartner in the firm of Gordon, Thomson, & Co. London nurserymen. The\r\nhot-houses are built exactly in the English style; the Pines raised and\r\nforwarded in pits, and fruited in broad low houses, with vines trained\r\nunder the rafters, in Speechly’s manner. M. Græffer died in 1816, and\r\nhis son has still the care of the royal gardens, and in 1819 had the\r\nPines, in what would be considered in this country, middling good order.\r\nThey were certainly of a much less vivid green than those of England or\r\nHolland, and the fruit was smaller; M. Græffer, jun. never having been\r\nout of Italy, was not aware of the difference; but on enquiring into his\r\nmode of treatment, we were led to suspect a deficiency of water and of\r\nmoisture, by watering the flues and paths of the house, and too great a\r\nheat kept up during the night. The air of Italy is, at most periods of\r\nthe year, much drier than that of the north of Europe; that of France\r\nand Germany is also drier than the air of Holland, Britain, and Russia;\r\nand perhaps this difference in atmospheric moisture, and the\r\noverheating at night, may, in some measure, account for the difference\r\nin the colour of the foliage of the Pine and other plants kept under\r\nglass in France and Italy.\r\n\r\nThere are some Pines grown at Rome, Florence, and Genoa; but they are\r\nnot much better than those of Portici. The greatest number, and the\r\nfinest plants and fruit which we saw in Italy, was in the Vice-regal\r\ngardens at Monza, near Milan, under the management of a most intelligent\r\nItalian gardener, a pupil of Professor Thouin of Paris, Signior Luigi\r\nVilaresi. The treatment is in all respects that of the Dutch; the plants\r\nare forwarded in frames, and sometimes in the open air for a month or\r\ntwo during summer; they are fruited in large pits, with a walk behind,\r\nand when more plants come into fruit than are wanted, they are retarded,\r\nor preserved, by being placed in a division of the pit without bark, and\r\nwhere they receive abundance of air in the day-time, but no water. The\r\nplants here were large and long-leaved, but still not so green and\r\nstocky as those of England, and the fruit did not appear to be above one\r\nand a half, or two pounds in weight. On enquiry, we found no air was\r\never left to the pits in the night-time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VI.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple in other parts of Europe._\r\n\r\nThe Pine Apple has been fruited at Stockholm, and in one or two places\r\nbesides in Sweden; and also in the Court gardens at Copenhagen, and by\r\nDe Conninck, and some of the rich merchants of Denmark; but we could\r\nhear of none being grown in either of these countries, when we visited\r\nthem in 1813 and 1814.\r\n\r\nIt is said to be cultivated in Spain, near the sea coast; and also at\r\nLisbon. We know it was grown by the late M. De Vismes, near the latter\r\ncity; and we believe it is now grown by some English merchants at\r\nSeville; but this is all we know. It does not appear to be grown in\r\nEuropean Turkey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nOF THE DIFFERENT MODES OF CULTIVATING THE PINE APPLE WHICH HAVE BEEN,\r\nAND ARE PRACTISED IN BRITAIN BY PRACTICAL GARDENERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pine Apple plant, as already observed, seems to have been first\r\nintroduced by Mr. Bentick, afterwards re-introduced from Holland in\r\n1719, and then first cultivated for its fruit in Sir Matthew Decker’s\r\ngarden at Richmond. Here, according to Professor Bradley, the gardener,\r\n“Mr. Henry Telende, imitated so successfully M. Le Cour’s newly\r\ndiscovered method of cultivating this delicious fruit, that he is likely\r\nto ripen forty of them in the present (1724) autumn.” (_Husb. and Gard.\r\nfor June 1724_, p. 161.) He elsewhere tells us that “the late instance\r\nof bringing the Ananas or Pine Apple to perfection in England, by the\r\ningenuity of Mr. Telende at Sir Matthew Decker’s, has so far gained upon\r\nthe curious, that already many of our nobility have undertaken the same\r\nimprovement; and ’tis not to be doubted but a year or two more will make\r\nthis undertaking much more general.” He mentions “their being brought to\r\nextraordinary perfection at the garden of the right honourable Spencer\r\nCompton, Speaker of the House of Commons, at Chiswick; and at that\r\ncurious gentleman’s, Mr. John Warner, Rotherhithe.” He informs us that\r\nan excellent stove on a new plan, with a bark pit, was built by William\r\nParker, Esq. near Croydon, in Surry, to make “experiments in ripening\r\nfruits that has not been tried;” and that Mr. Fairchild, in 1722, built\r\none at Hoxton for Pine Apples and other tender plants, in which the fire\r\nflues were raised above the surface of the floor, by which means all\r\ndanger from damps was avoided. Mr. Cowel, as before observed, (p. 4.)\r\nstates that in 1730 Pine Apple stoves were to be found in almost every\r\ncurious garden. Mr. Telende’s mode of cultivating the Pine Apple is\r\ndetailed by Professor Bradley in 1724, and the most generally approved\r\nmode of culture from that time to the middle of the eighteenth century\r\nmay be considered as given by Miller in his Dictionary. The improvements\r\nwhich have since been made by practical gardeners, may be ranged under\r\nthe heads of Justice, Speechly, Abercrombie, M’Phail, Nicol, Griffin,\r\nBaldwin, Andrews, Oldacre, Gunter, Grange, and Aiton. To each of these\r\nnames we shall devote a section; and under each, consider in succession,\r\nthe form of house, soil, general treatment, insects, and fruit produced.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\n  _Mode of cultivating the Pine Apple practised by Mr. Henry Telende,\r\n  in the Garden of Sir M. Decker, at Richmond, 1719, to 1730, or\r\n  later._\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ For the education and ripening of this fruit, Mr.\r\nTelende employed a frame made of deal, closely jointed: the length\r\neleven feet, divided equally into four lights; the width seven feet and\r\na half; three feet high at the back, and about ten inches in front. The\r\npit was somewhat more than five feet deep in the ground; the sides were\r\nlined with brick, and the bottom covered with pebbles.\r\n\r\nThe stove or fruiting-house used was that with iron plates over the\r\nflues; which, for greater warmth, was covered thick with thatch, and the\r\nglasses were well guarded with shutters; and that the fire might be\r\nconstant, he burnt only such turf as is commonly used in Holland,\r\nagreeable to M. Le Cour’s method.\r\n\r\n_General Management._ About the middle of February, he “puts in as much\r\nhot dung or horse-litter as will raise the bed about a foot high, and\r\nthen lays on the tanner’s bark as equally as possible, till the case of\r\nbrick-work is filled, beating down the tan gently with a prong, or\r\npressing it down easily with a board. A bed of this kind will take up\r\nthree hundred bushels of tan, and if it be well made, will heat in about\r\nfifteen days, provided the frame and glasses are set over it. When the\r\nbed breathes a right heat, which we are to judge of by a thermometer,\r\nthe plants are brought from the stove to it, either to have their pots\r\nquite plunged into the bark; or, if upon opening the holes for them, the\r\nbark be found too hot, then to be set in only half way, laying a few\r\npebbles under the bottom of each pot, that the water may pass freely\r\nthrough them. Care must be taken not to remove the pots in frost or\r\nsnow; and to examine the bed from time to time, whether the bark grows\r\nmouldy, musty, or dry, which it will often do in the summer: in such\r\ncase, it must be watered to recover its heat. A bed thus prepared and\r\nmanaged will maintain a constant degree of heat, sufficient to give\r\nthese plants the utmost vigour they require, from the end of February to\r\nthe end of October; and then the plants must be again removed into the\r\nstove or conservatory. In excessive heats the glasses are tilted up at\r\nthe back of the frame; and when the evenings are cool, the bed must be\r\ncarefully covered with substantial mattresses of straw. A bed of this\r\nkind sinks about a foot, which is convenient; for otherwise the plants\r\nwould be too tall for the frame, before the time of housing them.\r\n\r\n“The thermometer used by Mr. Telende had a tube twenty-four inches long,\r\nand one-eighth of an inch in diameter. When the spirit rose only to\r\nfifteen inches, he accounted the air cold for his plants; at sixteen and\r\na half temperate; at eighteen warm, which was his standard for Pine\r\nApple heat; at twenty inches, hot air; and at twenty-one inches,\r\nsultry.”\r\n\r\n_Insects._ Nothing is said on this subject.\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ Mr. Cowel says (_Curious and Profitable Gardener_, p.\r\n27.) that all gentlemen who had eaten Pines abroad allowed those raised\r\nby Mr. Telende to be as good and as large as they found in the West\r\nIndies. Bradley says, forty Pines were likely to ripen in the autumn of\r\n1724.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\n  _Of the Culture of the Pine, as given by Phillip Miller in his\r\n  Gardener’s Dictionary._\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ It was formerly the practice, Miller observes, to build\r\ndry stoves, in which the plants were kept in winter, placed on\r\nscaffolds, after the manner in which orange-trees are placed in a\r\ngreen-house; and in summer, in hot-beds of tanners’ bark, under frames.\r\nBut it is now the practice, he adds, to erect low stoves, called the\r\nsuccession-house, with pits therein for the hot-bed. It is also\r\nnecessary to have a bark-pit under a deep frame, for bringing forward\r\nthe suckers and crowns to supply the succession-house.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller’s fruiting-house has upright glasses in front, high enough to\r\nadmit a person to walk upright on the walk in front of the house. Over\r\nthe upright glasses there must be a range of sloping glasses, “which\r\nmust run to join the roof, which should come so far from the back wall\r\nas to cover the flues and the walk behind the tan-pit; for if the\r\nsloping glasses are of length sufficient to reach nearly over the bed,\r\nthe plants will require no more light: therefore these glasses should\r\nnot be longer than is absolutely necessary, that they may be the more\r\nmanageable.”\r\n\r\nThe difference between this stove and that of Speechly is, that in the\r\nlatter the sloping sashes reach to the back wall, by which means,\r\ninstead of a useless opaque roof over the path, an excellent place is\r\nformed for training a vine; and this being at all times the hottest part\r\nof the house, such vines as are there trained will produce very early\r\nand high-flavoured fruit.\r\n\r\nThe succession-house of Miller has no upright glass, and only a walk at\r\nthe back of the house: the bark-pit may be partly sunk in the ground, if\r\nthe situation be dry; or if wet, kept above it. The flue makes three\r\nreturns against the back wall, beginning from the level of the walk.\r\nMany persons, he says, have made tan-beds, with two flues running\r\nthrough the back wall, and covered with glasses, like common hot-beds;\r\nbut, besides the inconvenience of taking off the glasses when the plants\r\nwant water, the damps rise in winter when the glasses are closely shut,\r\nand there is danger of the tan taking fire.\r\n\r\nThe improvement on this plan consists in detaching the flue from the\r\nback wall, and separating it from the tan by a vacuity of two or three\r\ninches; or, what is still better, placing the flue in front similarly\r\ndetached, and surrounded by air on all sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4]\r\n\r\n_Soil._ “As to the earth in which Pines should be planted, if you have a\r\nrich good kitchen-garden mould, not too heavy, so as to detain the\r\nmoisture too long, nor over light and sandy, it will be very proper for\r\nthem without any mixture: but where this is wanting, you should procure\r\nsome fresh earth from a good pasture, which should be mixed with about a\r\nthird part of rotten neats’ dung, or the dung of an old melon or\r\ncucumber bed, which is well consumed. These should be mixed six or eight\r\nmonths at least before they are used, but if it be a year, it will be\r\nthe better; and should be often turned, that their parts may be the\r\nbetter united, as also the clods well broken. This earth should not be\r\nscreened very fine, but only cleared of the great stones. You should\r\nalways avoid mixing any sand with the earth, unless it be extremely\r\nstiff, and then it will be necessary to have it mixed at least six\r\nmonths or a year before it is used: and it must be frequently turned,\r\nthat the sand may be incorporated in the earth, so as to divide its\r\nparts; but you should not put more than a sixth part of sand, for too\r\nmuch is very injurious to these plants.\r\n\r\n_General Management._ “There are some persons who frequently shift these\r\nplants from pot to pot; but this is by no means to be practised by those\r\nwho propose to have large well-flavoured fruit: for unless the pots be\r\nfilled with the roots by the time the plants begin to show their fruit,\r\nthey commonly produce small fruit, which have generally large crowns on\r\nthem; therefore the plants will not require to be potted oftener than\r\ntwice in a season. The first time should be about the end of April, when\r\nthe suckers and crowns of the former year’s fruit (which remained all\r\nthe winter in those pots in which they were first planted) should be\r\nshifted into larger pots. The second time for shifting them is in the\r\nbeginning of August, when you should shift those plants which are of a\r\nproper size for fruiting the following spring. At each of these times of\r\nshifting the plants, the bark-bed should be stirred up, and some new\r\nbark added, to raise the bed up to the height it was at first made; and\r\nwhen the pots are plunged again into the bark-bed, the plants should be\r\nwatered gently all over their leaves, to wash off the filth, and to\r\nsettle the earth to the roots of the plants. If the bark-bed be well\r\nstirred, and a quantity of good fresh bark added to the bed, at this\r\nlatter shifting, it will be of great service to the plants; and they may\r\nremain in the same tan until the beginning of November, or sometimes\r\nlater, according to the mildness of the season.\r\n\r\n“In the summer season, when the weather is warm, the plants must be\r\nfrequently watered; but you should not give them large quantities at a\r\ntime: you must also be very careful that the moisture is not detained in\r\nthe pots by the holes being stopped, for that will soon destroy the\r\nplants. In very warm weather they should be watered twice or three times\r\na week; but in a cool season, once a week will be often enough; and\r\nduring the summer season, you should once a week water them gently all\r\nover their leaves, which will wash the filth from off them, and thereby\r\ngreatly promote the growth of the plants. During the winter season,\r\nthese plants will not require to be watered oftener than once a week,\r\naccording as you find the earth in the pots to dry: nor should you give\r\nthem too much at each time; for it is much better to give them a little\r\nwater often than to over-water them, especially at this season.”\r\n\r\n_Insects._ After describing the white scale or mealy pine-bug (_coccus\r\nhesperidum_, L.) he says, “wherever these insects appear on the plants,\r\nthe safest method will be to take the plants out of the pots, and clear\r\nthe earth from the roots; then prepare a large tub, which should be\r\nfilled with water, in which there has been a strong infusion of\r\ntobacco-stalks; into this tub you should put the plants, placing some\r\nsticks across the tub, to keep the plants immersed in water. In this\r\nwater they should remain twenty-four hours; then take them out, and with\r\na sponge wash off all the insects from the leaves and roots, which may\r\nbe easily effected when the insects are killed by the infusion; then cut\r\noff all the small fibres of the roots, and dip the plants into a tub of\r\nfair water, washing them therein. Then you should pot them in fresh\r\nearth, and having stirred up the bark-bed, and added some new tan to\r\ngive a fresh heat to the bed, the pots should be plunged again,\r\nobserving to water them all over the leaves (as was before directed),\r\nand this should be repeated once a week during the summer season; for I\r\nobserve these insects always multiply much faster where the plants are\r\nkept dry, than in such places where the plants are sometimes sprinkled\r\nover with water, and kept in a growing state. And the same is also\r\nobserved in America; for it is in long droughts that the insects make\r\nsuch destruction in the sugar-canes. And in those islands, where they\r\nhave had several very dry seasons, they have increased to such a degree\r\nas to destroy the greatest part of the canes in the islands, rendering\r\nthem not only unfit for sugar, but poison the juice of the plant, so as\r\nto disqualify it for making rum; whereby many planters have been ruined.\r\n\r\n“As these insects are frequently brought over from America on the ananas\r\nplants, those persons who procure their plants from thence should look\r\ncarefully over them when they receive them, to see they have none of\r\nthese insects on them; for if they have, they will soon be propagated\r\nover all the plants in the stove where these are placed: therefore,\r\nwhenever they are observed, the plants should be soaked (as was before\r\ndirected) before they are planted into pots.”\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ Miller finds suckers and crowns, if equal in size and\r\nstrength, fruit equally soon; and has seen as good fruit produced from\r\nplants received from the West Indies, as from any he has seen, and some\r\nthree times larger than any he saw in M. Le Cour’s garden.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple, by James Justice, Esq. F.R.S. at\r\n  Crichton, near Edinburgh, in 1732, and for some years afterwards._\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was one of the greatest amateurs of gardening of his\r\ntime, and a most successful cultivator of every thing he attempted. He\r\nhad a fine garden at Crichton, near Edinburgh, and corresponded with\r\nvarious foreign horticulturists of Holland and Italy, as well as with\r\nMiller, Bradley, and other eminent English gardeners of his time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5]\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ Justice, writing in 1754, says, “There have of late\r\nyears been erected in England and Scotland, many sorts of stoves for the\r\nculture of the Pine Apple; but I am sure, after many experiments, that\r\nthe plan here annexed is the best. In this stove, (fig. 5.) with one\r\nfire, I can do the business of two stoves, which must have two fires,\r\nand cultivate the old as well as the young plants.” The front and ends\r\nof this house are of glass, as well as the roof; the flue enters from\r\nbehind at one end, passes along the middle of the house, returns on\r\nitself, and then makes four returns in the back wall. The path-way\r\nenters from behind, at the end opposite to that at which the flue\r\nenters; proceeds to the middle of the house, along the middle, till it\r\nmeets the flue at the opposite; and then it turns round till it meets\r\nthe flue against the back wall, close by the furnace. By this\r\narrangement of the walk, no interruption is given to the flue; which is\r\nof great consequence, where it has so many returns to perform. A furnace\r\ninvented by Mr. James Scot, of Turnham Green, a commercial Pine-grower\r\nof those days, is recommended. It is cast in one piece, and requires a\r\nwrought-iron door and a cast-iron plate to build over the chamber.\r\nJustice agrees with Miller in recommending the furnace to be built\r\nwithin the house, (but supplied from without) in order that no heat may\r\nbe lost.\r\n\r\nThe plan given requires no succession-house; but he describes a frame\r\nused by many persons for growing young Pines, “made in the same manner\r\nas common hot-bed frames, but higher and broader; that is, three feet\r\nhigher at the back, sloping to one and a half in front, and six feet\r\nwide.” These cover a tan-pit causewayed at bottom, and surrounded by a\r\nstone wall. It is very proper, he says, to have these frames at work as\r\nwell as the stoves. He also mentions flued pits, such as are described\r\nby Miller (Sect. 2.) Both stoves and pits he covers with boards,\r\ntarpauling, or mats, at night; and the fuel he uses is coal or peat,\r\navoiding wood as of too rapid consumption.\r\n\r\n_Soil._ Two-thirds of good loamy kitchen-garden mould, one-third of old\r\nrotten cows’ dung, or hot-bed dung, and to every eight barrowfuls of\r\nthis a barrowful of sea-sand. He adds, “If your ground is naturally\r\nsandy, after having mixed it with the dung above mentioned, add thereto\r\na third of good fat marl; which succeeded so well with me, that in this\r\ncompost I had much larger fruit than in any other compound which I used\r\nto give them, which induced me to put, at all times, a good _deal of\r\nmarl_ in the compost I used for these plants.” This mixture should lie\r\nfor six months in those parts of the garden which are airy and least\r\nexposed to the sun; after the first three months, turn it over every\r\nfortnight. _Scots Gardeners’ Directory_, 2d edit. p. 124.\r\n\r\n_General management._ The same as is given by Miller. He tried some\r\nplants turned out of the pots with their balls, and planted in the bark\r\nfor the last nine months before the fruit ripened, and found the fruit\r\nlarger and earlier, but not better flavoured than that of the plants in\r\npots. In shifting, he never cuts off any of the leaves; “for it is\r\ncertain,” he adds, “that the leaves of all plants and trees bear the\r\nsame office to them, as the pulmonary vessels do to human bodies.” He\r\nwaters over the leaves when the plants have shewn fruit; because the\r\nfruit stalks, occupying what in young plants was a hollow tube, no\r\ninjury can happen. P. 129.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ At the first appearance of the bug, he picks off the scale\r\nwith a pin; and if that does not clean the leaves, he washes with a\r\nsponge; and, in extreme cases, uses Miller’s mode.\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ The object of all his directions is, “to have fruit\r\nlarge, good, and early, in a right season; viz. from the middle of June\r\nto the middle of September, but no later; for the rays of the sun, at\r\nthat time, have not strength enough to give them that poignancy of smell\r\nand taste that they ought to have.” P. 134. “Cut fruit when their smell\r\nis strongest and most poignant; if too ripe, they soon turn insipidly\r\nsweet, and have no more taste than an orange. Cut them about ten o’clock\r\nin the forenoon, with about four inches of stalk to them. When the fruit\r\nis to be sent to a distance, cut a day or more before they are ripe,\r\nwith a larger portion of stalk to them, and wrap them very close in\r\npaper, to preserve them from the air; otherwise their flavour will\r\nescape.” P. 132.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IV.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple, by John Giles, at Lewisham, in Kent,\r\n  1767._\r\n\r\nThis author, who was gardener to Lady Boyd, and afterwards foreman in\r\nthe Lewisham nursery, says, he writes after many years’ practice and\r\nobservation; and that his treatise will be found “of more real advantage\r\nto a young unexperienced gardener, than his giving a premium of five or\r\nten guineas to a mercenary old one (who perhaps might have had some\r\npractice, with a trifling degree of success,) to learn--what? why, to\r\nspoil his plants, with the loss of both money and reputation.”\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding the directions of Miller, Hill, (probably alluding to a\r\nletter on the Pine Apple in “Gardener’s New Calendar,” written by Sir\r\nJohn Hill, under his assumed name of Barnes,) Meader, &c. who have\r\nendeavoured to explore the method how the Pine Apple is to be grown;\r\nyet, upon trial, the success has always fallen much short of their\r\nexpectation. For these reasons, Mr. Giles “presents the public with\r\nexplicit directions for managing and bringing to perfection the Pine\r\nApple; in which all the obstacles and difficulties which gardeners have\r\nmet with in raising that fruit are remedied, and the true method pointed\r\nout in a clear and satisfactory manner.” Preface, p. vii.\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ The plants are brought forward in pits, and afterwards\r\nfruited in a stove forty feet long and twelve feet wide, with a pit six\r\nfeet wide, surrounded by a path, and a flue which makes three returns in\r\na flue close under the back wall. The front of the pit is about three,\r\nand the back about five feet from the glass. It will fruit, he says, a\r\nhundred plants annually, they being brought forward in the low pits or\r\nframes, and removed to the fruiting-house in September or October.\r\n\r\nThe obvious objection to the plan of his house is the having no flue in\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n_Soil._ A rich hazely loam from a well-pastured common. This soil alone,\r\nhe says, not only answers well for Pines, but for most vegetables.\r\n\r\n_General Management._ He recommends keeping a moist atmosphere in the\r\nhouse, and giving abundance of air when the plants are in fruit. His\r\nother directions relate to mere routine practices, and offer nothing\r\nelse worth quoting.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ A moist atmosphere, he says, will keep down these. “It is\r\nonly poor plants,” he says, “which are not in a good state of health,\r\nthat are infested with insects. They are encouraged by the warmth and\r\ndryness of the air of the stove, and the bad state of the plants; but\r\nwhere cleanliness and moisture are attended to, there will never be any\r\nworth notice.” P. 36.\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ He fruits the Queen Pine in two years, at the usual\r\nseason; but does not state to what size the fruit attains.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. V.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple, by Adam Taylor, Gardener at Devizes, in\r\n  Wiltshire, 1769._\r\n\r\nThis author, who was gardener to J. Sutton, Esq. at New Park, professes\r\n“to lay down a mode by which the Pine Apple may be produced in higher\r\nperfection, with more ease and less expense than has been hitherto known\r\nin this climate.” He offers his treatise with confidence, as not being\r\nfounded on hypothesis, but on some years’ experience; and it may be\r\ndepended on, as “it admits of the attestation of many persons whose\r\ntaste and judgment are unquestionable.”\r\n\r\n“The present way,” he says, “of raising Pine Apples, is made so\r\nchargeable by the erection of hot-houses, and the consumption of fuel,\r\nthat many, even of tolerable fortunes, have been deterred by the\r\nconsideration of it, from raising this desirable fruit. It is farther\r\nattended with trouble, and much uncertainty; and the fruit itself rarely\r\nanswers the expense either in size, number, or quality. But by the\r\npractice now recommended, these several inconveniences are sufficiently\r\nobviated. There are very few, even of commercial gardeners, who are not\r\nable to accumulate the necessary quantity of horse-dung, which is the\r\nprincipal article for this valuable end. And by such application of it,\r\nthey shall not fail to find their hopes abundantly answered, and their\r\nlabour well repaid.” P. 3.\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ He both rears and fruits them in a pit. This he forms\r\neither of boards, or of brick-work three feet deep, and of any\r\nconvenient length and width; and on the walls or boards, which inclose\r\nthe tan, he places a frame two and a half feet deep in front, and four\r\nfeet high behind. The ends and front are of glass, and the latter is\r\nformed into small sashes, which slide in a groove. The back is formed of\r\ninch boards, and against these he places a powerful lining of dung.\r\n\r\nThe pit he fills with tan, or dung, as may be most convenient; dung, he\r\nsays, does as well as tan, and only requires a little more trouble,\r\nwhich is amply repaid to the gardener by the value of the dung to the\r\ngarden, when no longer in active fermentation.\r\n\r\nAn anonymous annotator (to the copy of Taylor’s book, in the library of\r\nthe Horticultural Society) says, “I find by experience, that the dung of\r\nfour horses is sufficient to work two frames twenty-six feet each in\r\nlength, and six in breadth; one for the fruiting-house, the other for\r\nsuccession plants; and that it may be reasonably expected to cut forty\r\nfruit yearly after the first year, and the dung as valuable for the\r\nfield or garden, as if this use had not been made of it.” P. 3.\r\n\r\n_Soil._ “Take one load of mould from under the turf of a good pasture,\r\nand, if it be very light, add to it the fourth part of a load of good\r\nmellow loam: but if it be of itself of a loamy nature, mix into it two\r\nor three bushels of sea-sand. Then take the fourth part of a load of\r\ndung from a cow-yard, if it can be thence procured; but if not, take the\r\nsame quantity of good rotten dung from your old cucumber or melon beds.\r\nMix these well together, and turn the whole three or four times, that it\r\nmay thoroughly imbibe the air. All the large clods should be well\r\nbroken, but not sifted or screened, as is the practice with many; so\r\nshall you have a compost, which is excellently adapted to the growth and\r\nnourishment of the plants.” P. 15.\r\n\r\n_General Management._ He takes great care to keep his plants in a\r\ndormant state during winter; but about the end of March and April, he\r\napplies linings, and brings them into a growing state, shifting all\r\nthose not intended for fruiting that season. He covers the frames at\r\nnight throughout the year with straw, and a sail-cloth over, excepting\r\nin the warmest part of summer; at that season, during fine showers, he\r\nremoves the sashes entirely, and lets the plants receive a gentle\r\nwatering. He frequently waters over the leaves in the afternoons with a\r\npot having a fine rose, and shuts up early; which he finds produces a\r\nmoist heat, rapid growth, and keeps down insects. In winter he uses a\r\ntin pipe, to keep the water from touching the leaves of the plants; and\r\nas he has a very low temperature at that season, he gives them very\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ These he is not much troubled with; but he says, “Such plants\r\nas are attacked by them, should be immediately taken out of the frame,\r\nand plunged into a moderate hot-bed made of dung; this hot-bed should be\r\ncovered with one or two cucumber-frames, adapted to the height of the\r\nplants. Let these frames be covered with lights; so as to confine the\r\nsteam of the dung. As soon as the plants receive the heat of this bed,\r\nwater them all over the tops of the leaves with cold water. This will\r\neffectually destroy the insects; after which the plants are to be\r\nrestored to the covered frame again. A trial or two of this will\r\nconvince any person of the infallible efficacy of it.” P. 38.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that he destroys them by the operation of the ammoniacal\r\ngas, much in the same manner as does Mr. Baldwin.\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ He says nothing of the weight of the fruit, but he\r\ncalculates on fruiting the plants in two years, and ripening the fruit\r\nonly in summer and autumn, or between July and October inclusive; and he\r\nprefers the Queen Pine to all others.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VI.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple by William Speechly, gardener to his\r\n  Grace the Duke of Portland, at Welbeck, in Nottinghamshire, 1779._\r\n\r\nThe culture of the Pine, Mr. Speechly observes, has already been treated\r\nof by many persons, who have varied much in the methods they have\r\nrecommended. Far from meaning to depreciate their labours, he adds, “my\r\nadvice and pretensions rest solely upon the success which I have met\r\nwith in my experiments.” He went to serve the Duke of Portland in 1767,\r\nand published his book after eleven years’ experience. He continued at\r\nWelbeck till about the year 1800.\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ The great object of Mr. Speechly seems to have been to\r\ncombine the culture of the Pine and Vine; and for this purpose he\r\nadopted one form both for his succession and fruiting-house; training\r\nVines up the rafters, and on the upper part of the back wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6]\r\n\r\nIn many places small stoves of a particular construction (in the which\r\nthe Pines stand very near the glass) are erected solely for the purpose\r\nof _Fruiting-houses_. These, from their being always kept up to a high\r\ndegree of heat, are by gardeners usually termed _Roasters_. (fig. 7.)\r\nWhen there is such conveniency, it is customary, when any Pine-plants\r\nshow fruit in the large stoves, to remove such plants (especially the\r\nmost promising) directly into the fruiting-house; where, from the high\r\ndegree of heat kept, they generally swell their fruit astonishingly.\r\n\r\nIt is observable that Pines always succeed best in stoves that have been\r\nnewly erected; on which account, some of the more curious in the\r\ncultivation of this fruit have judged it expedient to pull down and\r\nrebuild their Pine-stoves every ten or twelve years. Although I cannot\r\nsubscribe to such expensive mode of procedure, I shall here beg to state\r\nthe many advantages that accrue from keeping Pine-stoves in good and\r\nproper repair.\r\n\r\nFirst, by keeping the flues clean from soot, and air-proof, they will\r\nheat the house better, and much less fuel will serve.\r\n\r\nSecondly, by a due attention to keeping the inside of the roof, &c. duly\r\npainted, and by constantly white-washing the walls and flues in every\r\npart of the house, the plants will be greatly benefited, both from\r\nhaving a better reflection and from cleanliness.\r\n\r\nA further advantage in stoves newly built may also here be remarked.\r\nWhere tan only is used, the beds are always filled at the first with new\r\ntan entire; but afterwards, constantly with new and old tan intermixt.\r\n\r\nLastly, it is probable that stoves, newly erected, derive their greatest\r\nbenefit from the good condition of the glass-work; for, however well it\r\nmay be kept in repair afterwards, it is certain that there never is so\r\nmuch light in an old stove as was at the first. Dirt will find its way\r\ninto the cavities between the squares, &c. which, obstructing the sun’s\r\nrays, darkens and gives a gloominess to the stove.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7]\r\n\r\nHe describes a Pine-stove to be heated by steam, in which the vapour is\r\nadmitted to a brick vault, over which is the bed of tan or earth; this\r\nis surrounded by a path and smoke-flues, exactly as in the common form\r\nof hot-house.\r\n\r\nHe also gives a plan of a furnace for burning lime as well as heating\r\nhot-houses, as erected at Billing, in Northamptonshire, and at Lady E.\r\nPonsonby’s, at Bishop’s Court, in Ireland; and, subsequently, at various\r\nother places in that country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8]\r\n\r\nIn these _kiln-furnaces_, (fig. 8.) the heat, after passing through the\r\nlimestone in the kiln or crucible (_a_), enters the flue (_e_), and\r\npasses through it in the usual manner. The grate on which the fuel burns\r\n(_d_) is contrived to draw out by means of a grooved frame (_c_), as\r\nsoon as the lime in the crucible is burned, which then falls into the\r\nash-pit (_b_), and is removed.\r\n\r\n_Soil._ Alter numerous experiments made with mixtures, of cow, deer,\r\nsheep, pigeon, hen, and rotten stable dung, with soot, and other\r\nmanures, in various proportions, with fresh pasture-soil of different\r\nqualities, he says, I can venture to recommend the following:\r\n\r\nIn the month of April or May, let the sward or turf of a pasture, where\r\nthe soil is a strong rich loam, and of a reddish colour, be pared off,\r\nnot more than two inches thick: let it then be carried to the pens in\r\nsheep-pastures, where sheep are frequently put for the purpose of\r\ndressing, which places should be cleared of stones, &c. and made smooth;\r\nthen let the turf be laid, with the grass-side downwards, and only one\r\ncourse thick; here it may continue two, three, or more months, during\r\nwhich time it should be turned with a spade once or twice, according as\r\nthe pen is more or less frequented by the above animals; who, with their\r\nurine and dung, will enrich the turf to a great degree, and their feet\r\nwill reduce it, and prevent any weeds from growing.\r\n\r\nAfter the turf has lain a sufficient time, it should be brought to a\r\nconvenient place, and laid in a heap for at least six months, (if a\r\ntwelvemonth it will be the better,) being frequently turned during that\r\ntime; and after being made pretty fine with a spade, but not screened,\r\nit will be fit for use.\r\n\r\nIn places where the above mode cannot be adopted, the mixture may be\r\nmade by putting a quantity of sheep’s dung (or deer’s dung, if it can\r\nbe got) and turf together. But here it must be observed, that the dung\r\nshould be collected from the pastures when newly fallen; also, that a\r\nlarger proportion should be added, making an allowance for the want of\r\nurine.\r\n\r\n1. Three wheelbarrows of the above reduced sward or soil; one barrow of\r\nvegetable mould from decayed oak-leaves, or leaves of other deciduous\r\ntrees, and half a barrow of coarse sand, make a compost-mould for\r\n_Crowns_, _Suckers_, and _Young Plants_.\r\n\r\n2. Three wheelbarrows of swarth, reduced as above, two barrows of\r\nvegetable mould, one barrow of coarse sand, and one-fourth of a barrow\r\nof soot, make a compost-mould for _fruiting plants_.\r\n\r\nThe above composts should be made some months before they are wanted,\r\nand very frequently turned during that time, that the different mixtures\r\nmay get well and uniformly incorporated.\r\n\r\nIt is observable, that in hot-houses, where Pine-plants are put in a\r\nlight soil, the young plants frequently go into fruit the first season,\r\nand are then what gardeners term _runners_; on the contrary, where\r\nplants are put in a strong rich soil, they will continue to grow, and\r\nnot fruit even at a proper season: therefore, from the nature of the\r\nsoil from whence the sward was taken, the quantity of sand used must be\r\nproportioned; when the loam is not strong, sand will be unnecessary in\r\nthe compost for young plants.\r\n\r\nI conceive that the _urine_ of sheep contains a greater quantity of\r\nmucilage, or oleaginous matter, than the _dung_ of those animals: and\r\nthis opinion is founded upon observations made in sheep-pastures; where,\r\nduring the summer months, the effects of both are easily distinguished.\r\nI also presume that the reduced sward in the pens receives a very\r\nconsiderable degree of fertility from the feet of the sheep.\r\n\r\nWhere oak-leaves are not used in hot-houses instead of bark, the\r\nvegetable-mould may be made by laying a quantity of them together, in a\r\nheap sufficiently large to ferment, as soon as they fall from the trees:\r\nthey should be covered for some time at first, to prevent the upper\r\nleaves from being blown away. The heap should afterwards be frequently\r\nturned, and kept clean from weeds: the leaves will be two years before\r\nthey are sufficiently reduced to be fit for use.\r\n\r\nI shall just observe, that it will be proper to keep the different heaps\r\nof compost at all times clean from weeds, to turn them frequently, and\r\nto round them up in long rainy seasons. If covered, the better: but they\r\nshould be spread abroad in continued frosts, and in fine weather.\r\n\r\n_General Management._ The pots he recommends are:\r\n\r\n                                _Inches diameter  _Inches_\r\n                                  at the top._     _deep._\r\n\r\n  1. Pots for full-sized crowns\r\n      and suckers                      6            5½\r\n\r\n  2. Pots for plants to fruit the\r\n       following season when\r\n       shifted in March                8½           7\r\n\r\n  3. Pots for fruiting plants         11½          10\r\n\r\nI wish it to be understood that the above dimensions are only used for\r\nfull-sized plants, at their different periods: plants below the standard\r\nmust have less-sized pots in proportion.\r\n\r\nSometimes, he observes, hot-beds are made for the suckers. When that is\r\nthe case, they should be prepared at least fourteen days before the\r\nsuckers are taken off, in order that the violence of the heat may be\r\nover: after the bed has been made ten days, it should be levelled, and\r\ncovered eight or ten inches with tan; and after this has lain four or\r\nfive days, in case the heat of the bed should not be violent, the pots\r\nmay be plunged into it.\r\n\r\nIn respect of temperature and water, he advises only a moderate heat,\r\nand not much water, during the winter months; but an increase of both,\r\naccompanied with more air, as the season advances.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing, he says, so prejudicial to the Pine-apple plant,\r\n(insects and an over-heat of the tan excepted,) as forcing them to grow\r\nby making large fires, and keeping the hot-house warm at an improper\r\nseason; which is injudiciously done in many hot-houses. It is\r\ninconsistent with reason, and against nature, to force a tropical plant\r\nin this climate in a cold dark season, such as generally happens here in\r\nthe months of November and December; and plants so treated will in time\r\nshow the injury done them: if large plants for fruiting, they generally\r\nshow very small fruit-buds with weak stems; and, if small plants, they\r\nseldom make much progress in the beginning of the next summer.\r\n\r\nAs the length of the days, and power of the sun increases, the plants\r\nwill begin to grow, and from that time it will be absolutely necessary\r\nto keep them in a regular growing state; for if young plants receive a\r\ncheck afterwards, it generally causes many of them to go into fruit.\r\nFrom the time they begin to grow they will demand a little water: once\r\nin a week or ten days, as the weather may prove more or less favourable,\r\nwill be sufficient till the middle of March, which is the most eligible\r\nseason to shift them in their pots. If that work is done sooner, it will\r\nprevent the plants from striking freely; and if deferred longer, it will\r\ncheck them in their summer’s growth.\r\n\r\nIn this shifting I always shake off the whole of the ball of earth, and\r\ncut off all the roots that are of a black colour, carefully preserving\r\nsuch only as are white and strong. I then put such plants as are\r\nintended to fruit the next season into second-sized pots with fresh\r\nmould entire.\r\n\r\nThe bed at this time should be renewed with a little fresh tan, in order\r\nto promote its heating, and the pots plunged therein immediately. The\r\nhot-house should be kept pretty warm till the heat of the tan begins to\r\narise, as it will be the means of causing the plants to strike both\r\nsooner and stronger. As soon as the heat of the bed begins to arise, it\r\nwill be proper to give the plants a sprinkling of water over their\r\nleaves; and as soon as they are perceived to grow, they will require a\r\nlittle water once a week for a short time, and afterwards twice a week\r\ntill the next time of shifting them in their pots.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer months give the plants plenty of air whenever the\r\nweather is warm, and water properly, as has been described: let the pots\r\nbe kept in a regular constant heat, and clean from weeds; but above all,\r\navoid an over-heat of the tan. Some persons plunge a thermometer in the\r\ntan, with the ball of its tube as deep as the bottom of the Pine-pots;\r\nand by repeated observations, a point is fixed for the spirits in the\r\npart of the tube above the surface of the tan, to show when the pots\r\nshould be raised. Whether the above, or the putting _watch-sticks_ in\r\nthe tan (which is the most common method) is practised, too much\r\nattention cannot be had whenever there is the appearance of too violent\r\na heat in the tan.\r\n\r\nIf the above directions are strictly attended to, the plants will be\r\ngrown to a large size by the beginning of August; when they should be\r\nshifted into the largest-sized fruiting-pots, with their roots and balls\r\nentire.\r\n\r\nBut it will be proper here to observe, that in some hot-houses it is\r\nfound difficult to get plants of the Antigua and Sugar-loaf kinds to\r\nfruit at a proper age; and, in that case, I advise the shaving off the\r\nroots on the outside, and reducing the balls of _them_ at this shifting.\r\nA greater proportion of sand should also be added to the compost, which\r\nwill be the means of bringing them into a fruiting state at a proper\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe disproportion of the second-sized and fruiting-pots is so great, as\r\nto admit of a good quantity of fresh mould at this shifting, which is\r\nabsolutely necessary to support the plants till their fruit becomes\r\nripe: it also affords an opportunity of performing the operation of\r\nshifting the plants without injuring their roots. As there will be a\r\nlarge space between the ball and the side of the pot, the mould may be\r\nput round the ball with great ease; whereas, when plants are shifted\r\ninto pots only a small size larger than those from whence they were\r\ntaken, they are generally much injured by the operation of shifting:\r\nbesides, even with the greatest care, there will frequently be spaces\r\nleft hollow between the ball and the side of the pot.\r\n\r\nA little fresh tan should be added, and the bed forked up, but not to\r\nthe bottom of the pit, as the tan is liable to heat violently at this\r\nseason of the year; of which when there is the least appearance, the\r\npots should be raised immediately. The delay of doing it one day may be\r\nattended with very bad consequences.\r\n\r\nThe plants will continue to grow very fast this and the following month,\r\nand should therefore be watered pretty plentifully, at least twice a\r\nweek; and, in the summer waterings, it should be observed, that it will\r\nbe of great service to the plants to be watered once a fortnight all\r\nover their leaves. If the month of October be wet and cold, the plants\r\nshould not be watered above twice in that month; but if fine and clear,\r\nonce a week: and here ends the watering of the fruiting plants for the\r\nseason. I never give them any water in the months of November and\r\nDecember; and during that time I keep the hot-house in a cold state, but\r\na bottom heat is always required; therefore the tan should have been\r\nrenewed, and the old part of it screened about the end of October or\r\nbeginning of November: from which time the bed will generally retain a\r\nmoderate warmth till the beginning of January, when the tan should again\r\nbe renewed. From that time the hot-house should be kept a few degrees\r\nwarmer; and, as soon as the tan begins to ferment, the plants may have a\r\nlittle water given them.\r\n\r\nIn this month (January) some of the plants will appear set for fruiting,\r\nwhich may be distinguished by the short leaves in their centres; and\r\nfrom that time they should be moderately watered (till the middle of\r\nMarch) and the hot-house should be kept pretty warm; a little air\r\nshould, however, be admitted, whenever the weather will permit.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of March it will be proper to renew the tan-bed, and,\r\nat the same time, the plants should be divested of a few of their bottom\r\nleaves; the mould on the top of the pots should be taken off as deep as\r\ncan be done without injuring the roots, and the pots filled up with\r\nfresh compost-earth, which will add to the vigour of the plants, as well\r\nas give a neatness to the whole when finished.\r\n\r\nIt is very injurious to the plants, and greatly retards the swelling of\r\nthe fruit, to remove them after this season; therefore, in case the heat\r\nof the bed should decline, a fresh heat may be got without moving the\r\nplants, by taking out the tan betwixt the pots as deep as possible, and\r\nfilling that space up with fresh tan.--This method is practised by some\r\neven at an earlier season.\r\n\r\nThe plants at this season will demand a kind, lively bottom heat; and\r\nwhenever the weather will permit, a great quantity of air should be\r\nadmitted into the hot-house, the want of a due proportion of which would\r\ncause the stems of the fruit to draw themselves weak, and grow tall;\r\nafter which the fruit never swells kindly.\r\n\r\nAs the fruit and suckers begin to advance in size, the plants will\r\nrequire plenty of water to support them, which may be given them at\r\nleast twice, and sometimes three times a week; but too much should not\r\nbe given them at one time; it is better to give them less at a time, and\r\noftener.\r\n\r\nSticks should be provided to support the fruit before it is grown too\r\nlarge; and, in tying them, care should be taken to leave bandage-room\r\nsufficient, making allowance for the swelling of the fruit.\r\n\r\nWhen the suckers are grown to about one foot in length, they should be\r\ntaken off in the same manner that has been described; and from that time\r\nthe fruit will swell very fast. As soon as the fruit appears full\r\nswelled, the watering such plants as produce them should cease: but it\r\nis too general a practice (in order to have the fruit as large as can be\r\ngot) to continue the watering too long; which causes the fruit to be\r\nfilled with an insipid, watery, and ill-flavoured juice.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to know when the Pine becomes ripe by its yellow colour; yet\r\nthey do not all change in the same manner, but most generally begin at\r\nthe lower part of the fruit. Such fruit should not be cut till the upper\r\npart also begins to change, which sometimes will be many days after,\r\nespecially in the Sugar-loaf kinds. Sometimes the fruit will first begin\r\nto change in the middle, which is a certain indication of its being\r\nripe: such fruit should be cut immediately.\r\n\r\nHaving thus laid down the culture of the Pine-apple plant, whether\r\nraised from seed, by crowns, or suckers, to its final perfection in the\r\nfruit, I shall now subjoin some hints and observations; most of which, I\r\nhope, will be of use.\r\n\r\nIn treating of the culture of the Pine-apple plant, some persons have\r\nrecommended the shifting of the plants, from first to last, with their\r\nballs entire; also the shifting of them oftener than I have here\r\nrecommended. These methods I disapprove, for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nFirst, it is observable that the Pine-plant begins to make its roots at\r\nthe very bottom of the stem; and, as the plant increases in size, fresh\r\nroots are produced from the stem, still higher and higher, and the\r\nbottom roots die in proportion: so that, if a plant in the greatest\r\nvigour be turned out of its pot as soon as the fruit is cut, there will\r\nbe found at the bottom a part of the stem, several inches in length,\r\nnaked, destitute of roots, and smooth. Now, according to the above\r\nmethod, the whole of the roots which the plant produces being permitted\r\nto remain on the stem to the last, the old roots decay and turn mouldy,\r\nto the great detriment of those afterwards produced.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the first ball, which remains with the plant full two years,\r\nby length of time will become hard, cloddy, and exhausted of its\r\nnourishment, and must therefore prevent the roots afterwards produced\r\nfrom growing with that freedom and vigour which they would do in fresher\r\nand better mould.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the old ball continually remaining after the frequent\r\nshiftings, it will be too large, when put into the fruiting-pot, to\r\nadmit of a sufficient quantity of fresh mould to support the plant till\r\nits fruit becomes ripe, which is generally a whole year from the last\r\ntime of shifting.\r\n\r\nIt is an object of emulation amongst gardeners to try to excel their\r\nneighbours in the size of their Pines. In order to produce very large\r\nfruit, I recommend the following method, which I have often practised\r\nwith great success.\r\n\r\nIn the month of April or May, it is easy to distinguish, in a stove of\r\nPines, which plants promise to produce the best fruit: this is not\r\nalways the case with the largest. A few of the most promising being\r\nmarked, a small iron rod, made with a sharp angular point, may be thrust\r\ndown the centre of the sucker; which, being turned two or three times\r\nround, will drill out the centre, and prevent its growing. This must be\r\nperformed on all the suckers as fast as they appear. Thus the plant\r\nbeing plentifully supplied with water, and having nothing to support but\r\nthe fruit, will sometimes grow amazingly large. But this method should\r\nnot be practised on too many plants, as it is attended with the entire\r\nloss of all the suckers.\r\n\r\nIt being a practice with some to fruit the Pine by setting the _pot_ in\r\nwater; while others produce the fruit by setting the _plant_ only in\r\nwater, (in a similar manner to what is often practised with Hyacinths\r\nand other bulbous roots,) the passing over these methods in silence may,\r\nby some, be deemed an omission: but as neither of these methods can be\r\nreduced to practice with any kind of success, except on fruiting plants,\r\nand just in the hot summer months, when the situation of the plant ought\r\nto be very near to the glass, they do not seem calculated for general\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nHowever, as some persons are inclined to suppose that Pines raised by\r\nthese methods are generally of superior quality, I shall just beg to\r\nsay, that the first method, of setting the _pot_ in water, is greatly to\r\nbe preferred, and that the best time for adopting it is immediately\r\nafter the plants have shown fruit in the spring.\r\n\r\nMr. Speechly is minute in his directions as to air, water, the use of\r\nleaves instead of bark, the application of fire, heat, &c.; but as all\r\nthese instructions are more to be considered as applicable to the\r\ngeneral management of the hot-house, than the particular treatment of\r\nthe Pine-apple, we do not think it advisable to trouble the reader with\r\ntheir perusal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 9]\r\n\r\n_Insects._ Those which more immediately infest the Pine, were first\r\ndescribed in Speechly’s book. They are all species or varieties of the\r\nLinnean order Hemiptera, and genus Coccus. The first is the _brown\r\nturtle bug_, _Coccus hesperidum_ (_Fig. 9._) The female has at first the\r\nappearance of a flat scale (_a_); afterwards, when depositing its eggs,\r\nit becomes fixed and turgid (_b_); these eggs (_c_) are hatched under\r\nthe mother, who soon afterwards dies; the young insects, seen under a\r\nmagnifier, appear like turtles in miniature (_d_). Only the males,\r\n(_e_), which are few in proportion to the females, have wings; these\r\ndevour nothing, and having performed the office of impregnation, die.\r\n\r\nThe _white scaly bug_, _C. hesp. var._ α (_f_ to _l_) bears a\r\nconsiderable resemblance to the above; but the scale (_f_) is somewhat\r\nsmaller; the colour is white, and the males or flies (_l_) not so large\r\nas those of the brown.\r\n\r\nThe _white mealy crimson-tinged bug_, _C. hesp. var._ ϐ (_n_ and _m_)\r\ndiffers from the former in being larger and crimson-coloured. Speechly\r\nconsiders it as viviparous. This and the former species are much the\r\nmost pernicious.\r\n\r\nMr. Speechly’s mode of destroying these and other insects, being much\r\ntoo elaborate for modern practice, it would be a waste of time to repeat\r\nhis processes. Simple modes are always the most effectual, and nothing\r\ncan be more so than M’Phail’s mode of applying the steam of water; or\r\nBaldwin’s, that of horse-dung.\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ Mr. Speechly does not seem to have had a fixed object\r\nas to the production of fruit, unless it was to have it good. Some\r\ncultivators, as Justice, aim at having all the fruit ripe at that season\r\nwhen they will attain the greatest size and most flavour, viz. in August\r\nand September; others aim at having some weekly throughout the year. It\r\nwould appear that the former was Speechly’s object, and that he did not\r\ncontemplate the other as now generally practised. “Large fruiting\r\nplants,” he says, “will sometimes show their fruit in the months of\r\nAugust and September, but these are generally thought of no value, and,\r\nconsequently, thrown away. To prevent this, I frequently take such\r\nplants out of the hot-house as soon as their fruit begin to appear. I\r\nthen set them in a shed or out-house for five or six weeks; at the\r\nexpiration of which time I pot them as in the month of March, after\r\nshaking off their balls. After this I plunge them into the tan.”\r\n\r\nWhat was the common weight of the Queen Pines produced at Welbeck, he\r\ndoes not inform us; but a fruit of the New Providence, produced in the\r\ngardens at Welbeck in 1794, weighed 5¼ lb., or 84 oz. He generally\r\nfruited the Queen Pine in the third season, being under two years of\r\ntime; and the Providence and Antigua in the fourth season.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VII.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple by James M’Phail, gardener to the late\r\n  Earl of Liverpool, at Addiscombe, in Surrey, from 1788 to 1808._\r\n\r\nMr. M’Phail, when in practice, was reckoned one of the first growers of\r\nthe Pine Apple in England; he grew the plants, and also fruited them\r\nchiefly in pits; the pots plunged in bark, and the bark inclosed by a\r\nperforated wall of his invention, and heated by linings of dung. He also\r\ngrew them in larger buildings.\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ No great consequence is attached to the construction of\r\nthe house by this gardener. Where Pines are to be grown in a hot-house\r\nalong with vines in Speechly’s manner, he says, “I think a good method\r\nis to make it into one or more divisions of about forty feet long,\r\nsixteen feet wide;” the back wall thirteen feet, and the front wall nine\r\nfeet, the upper four feet being composed of sliding sashes. The slope in\r\nthe roof will, by these dimensions, be four feet, or about three inches\r\nto a foot. The pit is to be surrounded by a path, which behind will be\r\nfour feet higher than in front, and, consequently, the end paths must\r\nhave steps. The fire-place being placed in the back wall, and supplied\r\nfrom the shed behind, the flue should be carried round about the inside,\r\nstretching from the fire-place across the end and along between the path\r\nand the front wall, leaving a cavity of four or five inches wide between\r\nthe flue and the wall, to admit the heat to rise freely, and to prevent\r\nthe roots and stems of the vines planted in the border against the front\r\nwall from being too much heated. At that end of the division farthest\r\nfrom the fire, after going across the house under the back path, the\r\nflue must rise above the path, and go along close against the back wall\r\ncommunicating with the chimney, which stands at the end corner of the\r\nwall just above the fire-place. The flue from the fire-place along the\r\nfront wall to the opposite end of the house, is to be made nearly three\r\nfeet deep, seven inches wide, and when it riseth above the back side\r\npath against the back wall to the chimney, it should be about three feet\r\nsix inches deep of brick, on edge two inches thick, besides the\r\nplastering, and covered with inch thick tiles closely joined with fine\r\nmortar to prevent the smoke from getting into the house among the\r\nplants. The mouths of the fire-places should be about sixteen inches\r\nwide, twelve inches deep, and the doors and their posts may be made of\r\ncast iron. The grates should be thirty inches long, and their bars of\r\nuncast iron made to take out at will. Some have the fire-places wholly\r\nof cast iron, one or more inches thick, in form of a square funnel about\r\nthree feet in length. This appears to be a good method, because they\r\nkeep in repair several years, whereas the sides of the fire-places built\r\nof brick generally require repairing yearly.\r\n\r\nThe tan-pit need not be deeper than three feet, or three feet six\r\ninches; and the path which surrounds it should not be narrower than\r\ntwenty inches; but two feet, or for the back pit two feet and a half,\r\nwill be better. The vines are introduced under the sill of the front\r\nglasses, and trained up the rafters; and Mr. M’Phail’s practice is not\r\nto withdraw them in the winter season as is done by other gardeners. The\r\nsurface of the tan-bed should not be nearer the glass than five or six\r\nfeet. Two houses, each forty feet in length, joined together, can be\r\nkept warm with two fires, better than one house of forty feet; but in\r\ncold, exposed situations, he would recommend diminishing the length.\r\n\r\nWith respect to pits, M’Phail observes, “Succession Pine plants grow\r\nexceedingly well in pits covered with glazed frames, linings of warm\r\ndung being applied to them in cold frosty weather. The north wall of a\r\npit for this purpose had best be only about four feet above the ground;\r\nand if about two feet high of it the whole length of the wall beginning\r\njust at the surface of the ground four feet below the height of the\r\nwall, be built in the form of the outside walls of my cucumber bed, the\r\nlining will warm the air in the pit more easily than if the wall were\r\nbuilt solid. The linings of dung should not be lower in their foundation\r\nthan the surface of the tan in the pits in which the plants grow (for it\r\nis not the tan that requires to be warmed, but the air among the\r\nplants); and as during the winter the heat of the air in the pit among\r\nthe plants, exclusive of sun heat, is not required to be greater than\r\nfrom sixty to sixty-five degrees, strong linings are not wanted: one\r\nagainst the north side, kept up in cold weather nearly as high as the\r\nwall, will be sufficient, unless the weather get very cold indeed, in\r\nwhich case a lining on the south side may be applied. In cold frosty\r\nweather a covering of hay or of straw, or of fern, can be laid on the\r\nglass above mats in the night-time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 10]\r\n\r\n“The brick bed of my inventing, (fig. 10.) for forcing early cucumbers,\r\nanswers well for growing small succession plants. A pit built on the\r\nsame construction, but of larger dimensions, without cross flues, is a\r\nsuitable one for growing Pine Apple plants of any size; for by linings\r\nof dung the air in it can be kept to a degree of heat sufficient to grow\r\nand ripen the Pine Apple in summer, as well as it can be done with fire\r\nheat, only it will require a little more labour and plenty of dung.\r\n\r\n_Soil._ “The Pine Apple plant will grow very well in any sort of rich\r\nearth taken from a quarter of the kitchen garden, or in fresh sandy loam\r\ntaken from a common, long pastured with sheep, &c. If the earth be not\r\nof a rich sandy quality of darkish colour, it should be mixed well with\r\nsome perfectly rotten dung and sand, and if a little vegetable mould is\r\nput among it, it will do it good, and also a little soot. Though Pine\r\nplants will grow in earth of the strongest texture, yet I have found by\r\nexperience that they grow most freely in good sandy loam not of a\r\nbinding quality.\r\n\r\n_General management._ “The method which I used to cultivate the Pine\r\nApple is the following: The fruit being partly over, and a cucumber\r\nbrick bed prepared for unstruck crowns and suckers, towards the end of\r\nAugust or September, I planted them in rich earth in pots suitable to\r\nthe size of the plants; I then had the pots plunged to their rims in the\r\ntan bed in which there was a good growing heat; the lights were then\r\nshut down close, and as great a heat kept among the plants as the heat\r\nof the tan and sunshine could raise, and when the sun shone long and\r\nvery bright, the plants were shaded a few hours in the middle of the\r\nday. The plants were thus managed till they had struck root and begun to\r\ngrow, when a gentle watering was given to them, and a little air\r\nadmitted daily. About the end of October or beginning of November, if\r\nthe state of the bed required it, a little fresh tan was added, and if\r\nthe plants by growth had become crowded, some of them were removed into\r\nanother place, and the remainder plunged into the tan bed, in which they\r\ncontinued till February or March, when of course the bed required an\r\naddition of fresh tan, which was given it, and the plants plunged again\r\ninto it at such distances one from the other as to give them room to\r\ngrow; here they remained till May or June, at which time they were\r\nshifted into larger pots with the balls of earth about their roots\r\nentire, and at this shifting, if the tan bed wanted it, fresh tan was\r\nadded to and mixed with the old, which in general enabled it to retain a\r\nsufficient heat till the month of August or September, when the plants,\r\nwith their roots unhurt, were shifted into pots large enough to admit\r\nearth easily round their balls between their roots and the sides of the\r\npots. In these pots I let the plants remain in general till the fruit\r\nwas over. At this time of shifting, the rotten part of the tan was taken\r\naway, and a sufficient quantity of new tan added, which generally, with\r\nan addition to the upper part of it, retained its heat till the latter\r\nend of February or beginning of March; at this time the plants were\r\ndivested of a few of their lower leaves, to let young roots spring\r\nfreely out of their stems, the surface of the earth in the pots cleared\r\ndown to the roots, and fresh earth laid on, pressing it close to the\r\nstems of the plants. After this dressing, the plants needed not to be\r\nmoved again till they ripened their fruit, unless they required more\r\nbottom heat. This is the general process which I used, though I found it\r\nnecessary to vary according to occurring circumstances, regarding the\r\nheat of the tan bed, the condition of the plants, and the state of the\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n“Some large kinds of Pine Apple plants require three seasons to grow\r\nbefore they can bring large sized fruit, such as the black Antigua, the\r\nJamaica, the Ripley, &c.; therefore in the month of April or May, after\r\nthey have been planted upwards of a year, it is best to take them out of\r\nthe pots, and to cut off all their roots close to the stem, or leave\r\nonly a few which are fresh and strong, and then plant them again in good\r\nearth in clean pots, and plunge the pots in a tan bed with a lively heat\r\nin it. After this process, a stronger heat than usual must be kept in\r\nthe house, till the plants have made fresh roots and their leaves be\r\nperceived to grow, when a little water may be given to them, which,\r\ntogether with a good bottom and top heat, will make them grow finely.\r\n\r\n“Crowns and suckers taken from the parent plants later than October,\r\nshould not be planted before the month of February or March; for in the\r\nwinter time, probably, they would not strike root, but rot: they may be\r\nhung or laid in a dry part of the hot-house. By some writers on the\r\nculture of the Pine it has been observed, ‘that any off-sets from the\r\nPine will succeed as well when planted in the hour they are taken off,\r\nas if laid by to dry till the wound be healed, provided the parent stock\r\nreceived no water for the ten days preceding.’ If off-sets or suckers be\r\ngrown to such a size, so that they be easily separated from the parent\r\nplant, they may be planted immediately; for, in that case, it may be\r\nseen that they had begun to push forth roots, and required to be taken\r\noff and planted; but withholding water from the mother plant ten, or\r\neven twenty days, will not bring its offspring to a state of maturity\r\nfit for planting the day when taken off. So that it is best to let\r\nunmatured young suckers and crowns lie implanted, till their natural\r\njuices be so exhausted that there may be no danger of their rotting\r\nafter being planted.\r\n\r\n“The brick beds of my inventing, in which I struck and reared Pine Apple\r\nplants many years, were close and warm, the crannies between the\r\nlappings of the glass being filled up with putty; consequently, in these\r\nclose frames, especially in the short days and long nights in winter,\r\nwhen the sun has little influence, the moisture arising out of the tan\r\nlodges on the glass, and drops from it, upon the plants; but, contrary\r\nto the opinion of some authors, who have advised to draw the water out\r\nof the hearts of plants when it falls into them in winter, I find, by\r\nexperience, that it does them no harm, if the heat in the place where\r\nthe plants be, is not too little. Indeed, if plants be kept in a climate\r\nwhich suits their nature, it is only reasonable to suppose that they are\r\npossessed of properties capable of disposing of water which happens to\r\nfall on them by accident or otherwise.\r\n\r\n“No vegetable substance that I know of retains heat so long, and of a\r\nless violent nature, than oak bark after being used by tanners; and, as\r\nthe vapours arising out of it are of a wholesome nature to plants, it is\r\nwell calculated for helping to make the Pine Apple plant grow\r\nvigorously. Where the Pine Apple is wished to be cultivated, and\r\ntanner’s bark cannot be procured, horse-dung well prepared, by shaking\r\nand breaking it small, will do. If plenty of the leaves of trees can be\r\nhad, they are preferable to dung. When leaves cannot be collected\r\nplentifully, dung and leaves may be mixed together, and used\r\nsuccessfully; and if it be ascertained that a good lively heat cannot be\r\nkept in the bed for want of good materials, let the heat of the flues\r\nwarmed by fire, or linings of dung, be close or near to the pit, which\r\nwill cause the heat in the bed to be more brisk and durable.\r\n\r\n“If it be intended to make a bed of leaves, they should be collected as\r\nsoon as they have all fallen from the trees, and in a wet state, and\r\nthrown together in a large heap; and after fermenting a few weeks, they\r\nmay be put into the pit for the pines. They should be well shaken, and\r\ntrodden down gently when they get into a fermentation, which will keep\r\nthem from sinking quickly afterwards, and prevent them from heating\r\nviolently. When the heat in the bed declines much, it may be increased\r\nby turning and shaking the leaves over with a dung-fork.\r\n\r\n“It sometimes happens that tanner’s bark heats too violently; but when\r\nthat takes place, it is either because there is too great a body of it\r\nput together, or because the heat of the flues is too close to the bed.\r\nIf a tan bed get into a violent heat, it will not keep its heat so long\r\nas if it heated moderately; for it must lose its heat as hastily in\r\nproportion as it is deprived of its moisture by violent fermentation.\r\n\r\n“It frequently happens that Pine Apple plants designed to bear fruit do\r\nnot show their fruit early enough in the spring or fore-part of summer,\r\nto ripen their fruit before winter, when there is not sunshine enough to\r\ngive the fruit any flavour. This may happen because the plants have not\r\ncome to a proper growth, or their roots may have been injured by too\r\nviolent a bottom heat, or by being over-watered, or they may have been\r\nshifted too late, or been put into pots too large for their roots to\r\nhave filled them before the end of the growing season. To make Pine\r\nplants shew their fruit at an early time in the spring, some authors\r\nhave recommended the cutting off some of the roots at the autumn\r\nshifting; but long experience has convinced me, that cutting off the\r\nroots, or destroying them by any means, instead of making them show\r\nfruit, is an effectual mean to prevent them from showing fruit, till\r\nthey have again made long roots. The fruit of the Pine Apple is formed,\r\nprobably, not less than seven or eight weeks before it appears among the\r\nleaves; and if a plant be divested partially or totally of its roots,\r\nits growth is stopped till it has made roots of considerable length,\r\nwhen it will grow quickly. And, if before the roots were destroyed, the\r\nfruit had been formed in the hidden secret centre of the plant, the\r\nfruit will grow and show itself when the leaves of the plant, excepting\r\nthose on the stem of the fruit, will make no appearance of growing.\r\nThis, perhaps, may be the reason which induces some persons to think\r\nthat cutting off the roots of the plant causeth it to fruit sooner than\r\nit would do were the roots suffered to remain.\r\n\r\n“If Pine Apple plants, intended for fruiting the following year, be\r\nshifted late in the autumn into pots, which their roots do not fill well\r\nbefore the month of January, they probably will not show fruit till late\r\nin the spring or summer months. For this reason it is advisable, when\r\nthey cannot be shifted early enough in the month of August or beginning\r\nof September, so as to fill the pots with roots before the winter come\r\non, to let them remain unshifted till the fruit appear, and the stem of\r\nit be grown to its full height, and then shift the plants into larger\r\npots, in the manner before directed, disturbing the roots of the plants\r\nas little as can be helped. After the plants are shifted, they must not\r\nget much water till the fresh growth of the roots has somewhat exhausted\r\nthe moisture of the fresh earth put round them. Of two evils, it is\r\nbetter to give the plants too little water than too much. But let it be\r\nremembered, that while the fruit is in blossom, and for some days\r\nafterwards, the plants should not be watered all over their leaves,\r\nneither should the plants be watered all over their leaves nor fruit,\r\nafter the fruit is fully swelled, nor should the earth in which their\r\nroots are, be, after that time, kept very moist, for they do not require\r\nit, because the plant has nearly performed its office, which it never\r\nhas to do a second time--it dies and leaves its offspring to succeed it.\r\n\r\n“Although the Pine Apple plant is of such a nature that it will live\r\nupwards of six months without earth or water, yet to bring its fruit to\r\nperfection, a plentiful supply of both these is required. From the time\r\nthat the plants are set in earth till they perfect their fruit, it\r\nshould be endeavoured to keep them constantly in a clean healthy growing\r\nstate; and when they be thus managed, they will not fail to show fruit\r\nwhen they be grown to a natural size. For these reasons, I would advise\r\nthat no methods contrary to nature, but methods to assist, be used to\r\nmake them fruit at certain periods. If Pine Apple plants be planted in\r\nrich earth, and get a sufficiency of heat and water, they grow\r\nluxuriantly to a great size, and do not show fruit so soon as they do\r\nwhen they are planted in a poor, hungry, or stiff soil.\r\n\r\n“If the roots of Pine Apple plants be not put in too great a heat, it is\r\na difficult matter to raise the heat in a hot-house to such a degree as\r\nis able to destroy the plants. In the brick bed of my inventing, a\r\npowerful heat can be raised by means of the linings of dung and the\r\nsun-beams, and in it the insects on Pine and on other plants may be\r\nshortly destroyed by heat and water.\r\n\r\n“Some persons may think that the Pine Apple cannot bear to be watered\r\nall over its leaves in winter, because it is of a succulent nature, and\r\nable to live long in a hot-house without being planted in earth or set\r\nin water. But, for instance, the common house-leek is of a very\r\nsucculent juicy nature, and will bear the greatest heat of a hot dry\r\nsummer on the warm tiles of a house: but it is well known that this\r\nplant thrives best when it gets occasional showers of rain. The case is\r\nexactly similar respecting the Pine Apple, and several other plants, of\r\na similar nature. In regard, however, to the best method of cultivating\r\nthe Pine Apple, there have been and will be persons who differ in\r\nopinion. I here give my opinion, which is founded on practice, that\r\nthere is not the least danger in watering the plants plentifully all\r\nover their leaves in winter, or in any time of the year, provided there\r\nbe a sufficient heat kept up in the tan bed and in the air of the\r\nhouse. But remember, I do not recommend watering the Pine Apple plants\r\nall over their leaves in winter as a general rule, only when it is\r\nnecessary to free the plants from insects and filth; then the heat in\r\nthe house among the plants must be kept strong, not lower than 70 in the\r\nmorning, and raised to 85 or 90 in the course of the day.\r\n\r\n“It is indeed evident that some of the most able writers on the culture\r\nof the Pine Apple have wanted that experience which may by practice be\r\nobtained. They have asserted, that it is impossible to keep the Pine\r\nApple plant throughout a severe winter without the assistance of fire.\r\nBut ingenious practical gardeners have ascertained, that Pine Apple\r\nplants require nothing more than a gentle heat in the tan bed, in which\r\nthe pots of plants must be plunged, and a medium heat of air of about 60\r\ndegrees, to keep them through the most severe winters in England. To\r\nmaintain this temperature of heat without the assistance of fire, is no\r\ndifficult matter; it can be done by the assistance of horse-dung; for a\r\ndry heat is not at all necessary to preserve the plants, and to keep\r\nthem in good health, in the brick beds, in which I kept Succession Pines\r\nall the year round without the aid of fire heat. The sun for about two\r\nmonths in winter had very little effect to warm or dry the leaves of the\r\nplants, so that during the dull months in winter, the plants were\r\ncontinually in a moist state, and water standing in the hearts of some\r\nof them, and the heat of the air among them was from 55 to about 65;\r\nand I do not recollect of having any of the plants die for want of heat.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ By many experiments which I made, it is evident, I think,\r\nthat in the process of managing and cultivating the Pine Apple, all\r\ninjurious insects may be destroyed, and prevented from breeding on them,\r\nby a judicious application of the elements necessary, though in a less\r\ndegree in regard to heat, for the production of any vegetables or fruits\r\nwhatever. That this is true, may be proved by a reference to the state\r\nof fruits and vegetables growing, either spontaneously or assisted by\r\ncultivation, in every part of the kingdom, without the aid of artificial\r\nheat or impregnated air. For instance, the strawberry, the raspberry,\r\nand some other fruits, which grow naturally in some parts of this\r\ncountry, and peas, beans, cabbage, and cauliflowers in gardens, and the\r\ndifferent sorts of corn and grass in the fields. These, in unkind\r\nseasons, we see affected by blights and by insects of various kinds,\r\nwhich prevent them from coming to good maturity, and make them less\r\nproductive than we wish them to be. But in propitious seasons, the earth\r\nbeing refreshed occasionally by showers of rain, they are preserved from\r\nthe inroads of insects and from blights, and are enabled to produce\r\nabundant crops, for the use of man and beast.”\r\n\r\nMr. M’Phail has thus the merit of being one of the first practical\r\ngardeners who freed themselves from the trammels of receipts and secrets\r\nfor destroying insects. He says, “after having studiously observed the\r\nnature and causes of the vigorous growth and healthfulness of plants,\r\nand of fruit-trees of different kinds, I have been induced to believe\r\nthat a fruit-tree or plant of any sort requires nothing but proper\r\ncultivation in good earth, and in a kindly climate adapted to its\r\nnature, to prevent it from being injured by insects, or by blights of\r\nany kind, and to enable it to produce, of its kind, abundant crops.\r\nHowever, I wish it not to be understood that I disapprove of using means\r\nof any kind to destroy insects which are injurious to plants; but I\r\nconceive that all methods used for that purpose, ought to be such as are\r\nconducive to accelerate the growth of vegetables, by having at least a\r\ntendency to purify the air, and to make the circumambient atmosphere\r\nabout them congenial to their nature, unless when the destruction of the\r\ninsects by the hand is effected.”\r\n\r\n“Every insect has its proper plant, or tribe of plants, which it\r\nnaturally requires for its nourishment, and on which it generally lays\r\nits eggs, and that on the most concealed parts of the plant; and the\r\nplant, and insect which attacks it, are always natives of the same\r\nclimate, and therefore endure the same degrees of heat and cold;\r\nconsequently, when plants are attacked by their natural tribe of\r\ninsects, it is an exceedingly nice and curious operation to exterminate\r\nthem without injuring the plants, or stopping them in their natural\r\ngrowth. But observing that insects increase rapidly in hot dry weather,\r\nand that they appear impatient of moisture, was the means of inducing me\r\ntry which would bear the greatest heat and live.”\r\n\r\n“To ascertain what degree of heat a Pine Apple plant can endure without\r\ndestroying it, I filled four vessels with hot water. The water in the\r\nfirst vessel was 130 degrees hot; that in the second 140; that in the\r\nthird 145; that in the fourth 150. Into each of these vessels I put a\r\nfew Pine plants, divested of their roots, of their fibrous roots, and\r\nsuffered them to remain in the water about an hour. The plants which had\r\nbeen immersed in the water heated to 140 and 145 degrees, were a little\r\nhurt in the extremities of their leaves, but after being dried in the\r\nhot-house, they were planted, and grew as vigorous as if they had not\r\nbeen put into hot water; the plants put into water 130 degrees warm were\r\nnot in the least injured; but those put into water heated to 150 degrees\r\nwere entirely destroyed.\r\n\r\n“By this experiment I ascertained that a vegetable can endure, without\r\nhurting it, 130 degrees of heat, according to the degrees on\r\nFahrenheit’s thermometer. I am inclined to think that no animal is able\r\nto endure such a heat and live. Undoubtedly, insects increase rapidly in\r\nhot weather in the open air, especially on the peach tree, and on other\r\ntrees, against warm walls, both in the spring and summer months; and\r\nthey increase most rapidly in dry weather; but the heat in the open air\r\nagainst walls seldom rises to 100 degrees. And in the hottest countries\r\nin the world, where vegetables and animals exist, the heat in the shade\r\nseldom rises to blood heat, which is about 97. Having considered these\r\nthings, and ascertained that a plant can endure a heat of 130 degrees, I\r\ndetermined to try another experiment, that is, to ascertain whether heat\r\nand water would destroy insects, and keep plants alive. I therefore\r\nthought of, and determined to try, the following method:\r\n\r\n“In the month of June I selected about twenty large Pine plants, some of\r\nwhich had green fruit on them, and their leaves, fruit, and roots, were\r\nalmost covered with insects. These plants I plunged in a tan bed, with a\r\nvery gentle heat in it. The tan bed was in a brick frame designed for\r\nrearing succession plants: it was nearly five feet wide, twenty feet\r\nlong, and the glass frames were close and in good repair. These plants I\r\nwatered frequently and plentifully, sometimes twice a day, with water\r\nnot less than 70 or 80 degrees, and sometimes 100, warm: in short, I\r\nkept the plants constantly in a moist air, by plentiful waterings\r\nwithout measure; and, excepting the time of giving water, I kept the\r\nlights constantly close shut down, even in the hottest sunshine, without\r\nshading the plants. In this frame I had no thermometer, but the heat\r\nwas, I think, sometimes about two or three o’clock in the afternoon,\r\nupwards of 120 degrees. This great heat and much moisture caused the\r\nplants to grow most vigorously; and having subjected them to the said\r\nmode of management for a few weeks, the insects, in the course of that\r\ntime, were totally destroyed, many of them lying dead on the leaves and\r\nfruit. In the spring-time, before this operation, the plants had been\r\nstrewed with sulphur, which, at least, is a harmless dressing to plants\r\nof any kind, and probably may be of use in preventing insects from\r\nbreeding numerously, or the means of depriving them of part of their\r\nnatural food. This circumstance, however, I just here mention, because,\r\nfrom experiments which I have tried since then, it is probable that the\r\neffluvia arising from flour of sulphur, being scattered on the leaves,\r\nor about in the hot-house, in conjunction with heated air and moisture,\r\nmay more suddenly destroy insects than heat and moisture alone; but it\r\nought to be remembered, that if sulphur be by any means set on fire in a\r\nconfined place, among plants of any kind, it will either totally destroy\r\nor greatly injure them.\r\n\r\n“Being satisfied with my success in the above-mentioned experiment, of\r\nhaving totally destroyed the insects on these plants without hurting\r\nthem, I hesitated not to begin to water the whole of the plants under my\r\ncare, whenever they wanted it, all over their leaves and fruit, with\r\nwater about 85 degrees warm. This process I continued to practise for\r\nseveral months, during which time I do not recollect that the\r\nthermometer was ever below 70, and in sunshine it was raised sometimes\r\nto upwards of 110 degrees. I continued this practice longer perhaps than\r\nwas absolutely necessary, but I was determined to destroy the whole of\r\nthe insects in the house, whether on the plants, or in the tan, or in\r\nany part of the house; and this I certainly did accomplish effectually.\r\nThus, by this easy, and not unnatural, mode of management, the plants\r\nbecame perfectly free of insects; they were perfectly cleansed of all\r\nfilth; they grew vigorously; and the fruit swelled fine to a good size.\r\nAfter this I had several times Pine Apple plants from abroad, and out of\r\nhot-houses at home, full of insects, which, by the means that I have,\r\nwithout reserve, described, I effectually destroyed, and made the plants\r\ngrow very fast indeed.”\r\n\r\n“If Pine Apple plants be kept in a strong vigorous growing state by\r\ngiving them plenty of heat, and water applied occasionally all over\r\ntheir leaves, whether they be in frames heated with dung, or in\r\nhot-houses heated by a fire, a few insects will do them little hurt. But\r\nif the methods which I have given for cultivating the Pine Apple plant\r\nbe adopted, I am persuaded all sorts of injurious insects natural to\r\nthese sorts of plants will disappear on them.\r\n\r\n“When we see human creatures lean in body for want of a sufficiency of\r\nwholesome food, or, for want of cleanliness, lice and fleas breed upon\r\nthem; and poverty in cattle for want of food has the same effect on\r\nthem. Similar causes in vegetables has a similar effect, so that when\r\nPine Apple plants are in a state of poverty, for want of a sufficiency\r\nof good earth, or of heat, or of water, insects natural to them, if\r\nthere be any of them in the hot-house, will breed rapidly on them and\r\nhurt them. Those insects which naturally breed and live on the Pine\r\nApple plant, appear to delight in a dry dirty situation. Where Pine\r\nApples grow naturally and produce large fruit, they are not free of\r\ninsects; and though plants be free of insects, they will not grow well,\r\nnor produce fine fruit, unless they get enough of good earth, sufficient\r\nheat, and be watered plentifully.”\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ The green, and some other sorts of Pine, Mr. M’Phail\r\n“ripened in a shorter period of time than two years after planting,”\r\n(_Gard. Rem._ 87.) but some large kinds he found required three seasons,\r\nas the black Antigua, Jamaica, and Ripley. His object was to have his\r\nfruit come in for use between May and October, for he very justly\r\nremarks, that “the fruit of the Pine Apple, if it happen to appear ripe\r\nin winter, will have its flavour insipid.” He therefore recommends, that\r\nsuch plants as show fruit in September or October, had better be cast\r\naway, unless there be plenty of room for them in the hot-house; in that\r\ncase they may be retained by way of experiment, and to obtain young\r\nplants from them. (_Gard. Rem._ 98.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. VIII.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple in Fifeshire, by Mr. Walter Nicol._\r\n\r\nMr. Nicol was from 1790 to 1800, the best grower of the Pine Apple in\r\nScotland; he had afterwards much experience as a constructor of\r\nhot-houses; and extensive observation of the practice of the best\r\ngardeners of the north.\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ “Pineries,” he says, “are, and may be, very differently\r\nconstructed; and we find plants thriving, and plants not thriving, in\r\nall kinds of stoves, pits, &c. The culture of Pine Apples is attended\r\nwith a heavier expense than that of any other fruit under glass;\r\nespecially if they be grown in lofty stoves, the erection of which is\r\nvery expensive, and the keeping up proportionally more so, than that of\r\nhumbler stoves, or flued pits.\r\n\r\n“But, independently of all considerations of expense (which may not be\r\nvalued by some, provided they can obtain good fruit), Pine Apples may\r\ncertainly be produced in as great perfection, if not greater, and with\r\ninfinitely less trouble and risk, in flued pits, if properly\r\nconstructed, than in any other way. I would therefore have the Pinery\r\ndetached from the other forcing-houses, and to consist of three pits in\r\na range; one for crowns and suckers, one for succession, and one for\r\nfruiting plants. The fruiting-pit to be placed in the centre, and the\r\nother two, right and left; forming a range of a hundred feet in length;\r\nwhich would give Pine Apples enough for a large family.\r\n\r\n“The fruiting-pit to be forty feet long, and ten feet wide, over walls;\r\nand each of the others to be thirty feet long, and nine feet wide, also\r\nover walls. The breast-wall of the whole to be on a line, and to be\r\neighteen inches above ground. The back-wall of the centre one to be five\r\nfeet, and of the others, to be four and a half feet higher than the\r\nfront. The front and end flues to be separated from the bark-bed by a\r\nthree-inch cavity, and the back flues to be raised above its level.\r\n\r\n“The furnaces may either be placed in front, or at the back, according\r\nto conveniency; but the strength of the heat should be first exhausted\r\nin front, and should return in the back-flues. The fruiting-pit would\r\nrequire two small furnaces, in order to diffuse the heat regularly, and\r\nkeep up a proper temperature in winter; one to be placed at each end;\r\nand either to play, first in front, and return in the back; but the\r\nflues to be above, and not alongside of one another; as in that latter\r\nway they would take up too much room. The under one to be considered\r\nmerely as an auxiliary flue, as it would only be wanted occasionally.\r\n\r\n“None of these flues need be more than five or six inches wide, and nine\r\nor ten deep. Nor need the furnaces be so large by a third, or a fourth\r\npart, as those for large forcing-houses; because there should be proper\r\noil-cloth covers for the whole, as guards against severe weather, which\r\nwould be a great saving of fuel.\r\n\r\n“The depth of the pits should be regulated so as that the average depth\r\nof the bark-beds may be a yard below the level of the front flues; as to\r\nthat level the bark will generally settle, although made as high as\r\ntheir surfaces, when new stirred up. If leaves, or a mixture of leaves\r\nwith dung, are to be used instead of bark, the pits will require to be a\r\nfoot, or half a yard deeper.\r\n\r\n“It may be thought too much to insinuate, that those who have large\r\nPineries should turn them to other purposes, and erect such as are\r\ndescribed above. There cannot be a doubt, however, respecting the\r\nsatisfaction that would follow, if to have good fruit at an easy rate\r\nwere the object. I have given designs for no other kinds of new Pineries\r\nthese six years past, but such as these; with some variations respecting\r\nextent, however, in order to suit different purses.”\r\n\r\n_Soil._ Vegetable mould, strong brown loam, pigeons’ dung, and\r\nshell-marl, are Mr. Nicol’s ingredients. “The vegetable mould used is\r\nthat from decayed tree-leaves, and those of the oak are to be preferred;\r\nbut when a sufficient quantity of them cannot be had, a mixture with\r\nthose of the ash, elm, birch, sycamore, &c. or indeed any that are not\r\nresinous, will answer very well. In autumn, immediately as the leaves\r\nfall, let them be gathered, and be thrown together into an heap; and let\r\njust as much light earth be thrown over them as will prevent them from\r\nbeing blown abroad by the wind. In this state let them lie till May, and\r\nthen turn them over and mix them well. They will be rendered into mould\r\nfit for use by the next spring; but from bits of sticks, &c. being among\r\nthem, they will require to be sifted before using. Strong brown loam is\r\nthe next article. This should consist of the sward of a pasture, if\r\npossible; which should, previous to using, be well reduced, by exposing\r\nit a whole year to the action of the weather. Pigeon-dung, also, that\r\nhas lain at least two whole years in an heap, has been frequently\r\nturned, and well exposed to the weather, is to be used. Likewise\r\nshell-marl. And, lastly, sea or river gravel, which should be sifted,\r\nand kept in a dry place; such part of it as is about the size of\r\nmarrowfat peas is to be used. This is the proportion: for crowns and\r\nsuckers, entire vegetable mould, with a little gravel at bottom, to\r\nstrike in; afterwards, three-fourths vegetable mould, and one-fourth\r\nloam, mixed with about a twentieth part gravel, and two inches entire\r\ngravel at bottom, till about a year old. For year-olds, and till shifted\r\ninto fruiting-pots, one-half vegetable mould, one-half loam; to which\r\nadd a twentieth part gravel, and as much shell-marl, with three inches\r\nclean gravel at bottom. For fruiting-plants, one-half loam, a fourth\r\npart vegetable mould, and a fourth part pigeon-dung; to which add marl\r\nand gravel as above, and lay three or four inches of clean gravel at\r\nbottom. The above compositions are what I formerly used for Pine-plants\r\nwith much success; and are what may be reckoned good medium soils for\r\nthe production of Pine Apples.”\r\n\r\n_General Management._ Mr. Nicol plants his suckers in summer and autumn\r\nas the fruit is gathered, sticking them into the front part of the\r\nbark-bed, “where they will strike root as freely as any where. If a\r\nlarge proportion of the crop come off early, the crowns and suckers may\r\nbe potted at once, and plunged into the nursing-pit; or they may be\r\ntwisted from off the stocks, and may be laid by, in a dry shed or loft\r\nfor a few days, till the other operations in the Pinery be performed,\r\nand the nursing-pit be ready to receive them and the crowns, (collected\r\nas the fruit have been gathered;) which, if rooted, may be potted, and\r\nmay be placed for the above time, either in a frame, or in a\r\nforcing-house of any kind, as they will sustain no injury, though out of\r\nthe bark-bed for so short a time. Such crowns as have not struck root,\r\nmay be laid aside with the suckers.\r\n\r\n“With respect to the time for taking off the suckers, it is when the\r\nbottom part becomes brown; and they are then easily displaced by the\r\nthumb, after having broken down the leaf immediately under them. But,\r\nindeed, by the time the fruit is ripe, all suckers of the stem are fit\r\nfor taking off, though they will sustain no injury by being left on,\r\neven for a month, but rather improve, if the stock be healthy, and if it\r\nbe well watered. Suckers that rise from the root always have fibres, and\r\nmay be taken off at any time; but, as they are tardy of fruiting, they\r\nshould not be taken into the stock, unless in a case of necessity.\r\n\r\n“Some think it necessary to dry, or win, all crowns and suckers before\r\npotting them, and for that purpose lay them on the shelves, &c. of the\r\nstove for a week or ten days. By this treatment, they certainly may be\r\nhurt, but cannot be improved, provided they have been fully matured\r\nbefore being taken from off the fruit or stocks, and that these have\r\npreviously had no water for about ten days. They will succeed as well,\r\nif planted the hour they are taken off, as if treated in any other way\r\nwhatever; and I only advise their being laid aside as above, as being a\r\nmatter of conveniency.”\r\n\r\nIn preparing the suckers and unstruck crowns for potting, he twists off\r\na few of the bottom leaves, and pares the end of the stump smooth with\r\nthe knife. “Then fill pots of about three or four inches diameter, and\r\nfive or six inches deep, (the less for the least, and the large for the\r\nlargest plants), with very fine, light earth, or with entire vegetable\r\nmould of tree leaves, quite to the brim; previously placing an inch of\r\nclean gravel in the bottom of each, and observing to lay in the mould\r\nloosely. Thrust the large suckers down to within two inches of the\r\ngravel, and the small ones and crowns, two inches into the mould;\r\nfirming them with the thumbs, and dressing off the mould, half an inch\r\nbelow the margin of the pots. Then plunge them into the bark-bed, quite\r\ndown to, or rather below the brim, especially of the smaller pots. If\r\nthe pots be placed at the clear distance of three or four inches from\r\neach other, according to the sizes of the plants, they will have\r\nsufficient room to grow till next shifting.”\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the nursing-pit in January with fire heat, he keeps\r\nas near as possible to 65° mornings and evenings; and in sunshine, on\r\ngood days, it may be allowed to rise to about 70°. In March from 70° to\r\n80°; and after newly potting and plunging, unstruck crowns and suckers\r\nto 80° or 85°.\r\n\r\nTo save fuel, he covers up the Pine pits when fires are used, every\r\nevening after sunset, either with double mats, or with a thick canvas\r\ncover, mounted on rollers. This cover he removes by sun-rise in the\r\nmorning, unless the weather be very severe; in which case he leaves it\r\non during the day. By the judicious use of this cover, he finds “a\r\nconsiderable deal of fuel may be saved.”\r\n\r\nAs to water, he says, “nurse plants require very little, perhaps once in\r\neight or ten days, or even at greater intervals, if the weather be moist\r\nand hazy. It is safer, in winter, to give too little, rather than too\r\nmuch water to Pine-plants; nor should they be watered over head at this\r\nseason. They should be watered in the forenoon of a sunny day, at this\r\ntime of the year, in order that any water spilt on the bark, or in the\r\nhearts of the plants, may be exhaled by the heat of the sun, and by an\r\nextra quantity of air purposely admitted. This precaution, however, is\r\nonly necessary for the sake of such crowns and suckers as have been\r\nstruck late last season, and are not very well rooted; such being more\r\napt to damp off than others that are better established.” In summer he\r\nsupplies water regularly and plentifully once in three days; giving the\r\nproper quantity at root, and then a dewing over the leaves. He waters\r\nfrequently with the drainings of the dunghill.\r\n\r\nAir he admits to the nursing-pits every good day. Even in hard frost,\r\nwhen the sun shines, two or three of the lights should be slipped down,\r\nto let the rarified air escape at top. After potting unrooted offsets,\r\nhe gives no air till the heat begin to rise in the bark-bed; but as the\r\nplants indicate their having made roots, he gives air during sunshine,\r\nso as to keep down the thermometer to 85° or 80°.\r\n\r\nSuckers planted in summer he shifts or re-pots in the following March.\r\nHe says, “Let them be shaked out entirely; the balls be quite reduced;\r\nthe roots be trimmed of all straggling and decayed fibres; and let them\r\nbe replaced in the same, or in similar pots. The proper size of pots,\r\nhowever, in which to put crowns and suckers struck last season, is about\r\nfour inches inside diameter at top, and six inches deep. A little clean\r\ngravel should be laid at the bottom of each pot, in order to drain off\r\nextra moisture; and this should be observed in the potting of\r\nPine-plants of all sorts. I have generally observed, that if the bark\r\nheat be not violent, the plants will push very strong fibres into this\r\nstratum of gravel, in which they seem to delight. I therefore generally\r\nmake it two inches thick in small pots, and three or four in larger\r\nones, less or more, according to their size. From the time I first\r\nadopted this mode of potting, I hardly ever had an instance of an\r\nunhealthy plant; and this very particular, together with that of keeping\r\nthe plants always in a mild bottom-heat, is of greater importance in the\r\nculture of Pines, than all the other rules that have been given\r\nrespecting them, out of the ordinary way. The roots of Pines seem to\r\ndelight in gravel; and I have been careful to introduce it into the\r\nmould for plants of all ages. I generally used small sea-gravel, in\r\nwhich was a considerable proportion of shells, or chips of shells, with\r\nother particles of a porous nature; and I have uniformly observed the\r\nfinest fibres cling to these, and often insinuate themselves through the\r\npores, or embrace the rougher particles. Therefore, if sea gravel can be\r\nobtained, prefer it; and next, river gravel; but avoid earthy pit\r\ngravel, and rather use sharp sand, or a mixture of pounded-stone, chips,\r\nand brick-bats. The plants being re-potted, plunge them in the bark-bed\r\nagain, quite down to the rims of the pots, keeping them perfectly level.\r\nEight or nine inches from centre to centre will be distance sufficient.\r\nWhen they are all placed, give a little aired water, to settle the earth\r\nabout their roots. This need not be repeated till the heat in the bed\r\nrise to the pots, after which, as the plants will now begin to grow\r\nfreely, they must be watered at the root once in four or five days; and\r\nthey may have a dewing over head, from the fine rose of a watering-pot,\r\noccasionally, if the weather be fine.”\r\n\r\nIn May, Nicol again shifts, but the plants are not to be shaked out at\r\nthis time, but are to be shifted, balls entire, into pots of about six\r\ninches diameter, and eight inches deep. “If the roots be anywise matted\r\nat bottom, or at the sides, they must be carefully singled out; and in\r\npotting, be sure that there be no cavity left between the ball and the\r\nsides of the new pot. In order the more effectually to prevent which,\r\nuse a small, blunt-pointed, somewhat wedge-shaped, stick, to trindle in\r\nthe mould with; observing that it be in a dry state, and be sifted fine;\r\nand also to shake the pot well, (potting on a bench or table), the\r\nbetter to settle the earth about the ball. Pots of this size should be\r\nfilled to within half an inch of their brims, (the balls being covered\r\nabout an inch with fresh earth), as the whole will settle about as much,\r\nand so leave a full inch for holding water, which is enough. In\r\npreparing the plants for potting, observe to twist off a few of the\r\nbottom leaves, as they always put out fine roots from the lower part of\r\nthe stem. Also, before letting the plant out of hand, trim off the\r\npoints of any leaves that may have been bruised or anywise injured in\r\nthe shifting. Replunge the pots to the brim, as before, observing to\r\nkeep them quite level, at the distance of fifteen inches from centre to\r\ncentre of the plants on a medium; then give a little water, which need\r\nnot be repeated till the heat rise to the pots.”\r\n\r\nIn November, he shifts such others whose roots have filled their pots,\r\nand have become anywise matted. “Examine any you suspect to be so, and\r\nlet them be shifted into pots of the next size immediately above those\r\nthey are in; keeping the balls entire, and only singling out the netted\r\nfibres at bottom. The rest should be trimmed of any dead leaves at\r\nbottom of their stems, and should have a little of the old mould taken\r\nfrom off the surface of the pots; which replace with fresh earth;\r\nfilling the pots fuller than usual, as but little water will be required\r\ntill next shifting time in the spring. The whole should then be replaced\r\nin the bark-bed as before, and should be plunged quite to the rims of\r\nthe pots; giving a little water to settle the earth about their roots,\r\nwhich need not be repeated till the heat rise in the bed.”\r\n\r\nPlants intended to fruit in the succeeding year, are shifted finally in\r\nthe August of the year preceding. The plants are again looked over in\r\nthe February following, and top dressed; but such as are unhealthy,\r\nfeeble, and do not stand firm in their pots, he shakes out of their\r\nballs entirely, and re-pots in the same, or in smaller pots. “Any\r\nplants,” he says, “that have already started into fruit, should also be\r\nshaken out, and be fresh potted, as above; which, by the check they\r\nreceive, will keep them back to a better season of ripening, and by the\r\nforce of fresh earth, make them swell their fruit larger than they\r\notherwise would have done. I have thus new-potted plants, even in\r\nflower, with very much success, and have swelled the fruit to a size far\r\nbeyond my expectations; of which fact any one may easily satisfy\r\nhimself, by fresh-potting a few plants, and comparing their progress\r\nwith others treated in the ordinary way. Let the plants be re-plunged to\r\nthe brim as before, keeping the pots quite level. If the plants be\r\nfull-sized, and strong, they will require to be set at about twenty\r\ninches apart from centre to centre, on a medium. But they should be\r\nsorted; the smallest placed in front, and the largest at back, as in\r\narranging plants on a stage, that they may have an equal share of sun\r\nand light. As soon as re-placed in the bark-bed, let them have a little\r\nwater, to settle the earth about their roots.” In May he again\r\ntop-dresses, “reducing an inch or two of the earth from off the surface,\r\nand adding some fresh mould, which will invigorate the plants, cause\r\nthem to push surface radicles, and so keep them the more firm and\r\nsteady. This needs not be done, however, to plants whose fruit are\r\nnearly ripe; but chiefly to healthy plants new shown in flower, past the\r\nflower, or with the fruit about half grown. And with respect to any that\r\nare unhealthy, and whose fruit are less than half grown, do not hesitate\r\nto shift them, shaking them out, trimming their roots, and retaining\r\nonly healthy fibres. This is a very great improvement in the culture of\r\nPines, which I formerly practised, have since advised, and have seen\r\nfollowed with much success.”\r\n\r\nThe temperature of the fruiting-pit is kept at the same degree as that\r\nof the succession department in mid-winter. This is from 60° to 65°; but\r\nas spring approaches, he rises gradually to 75°, but not allowing the\r\nthermometer to pass 80°. From 72° to 75° is his temperature for March\r\nand April. In May, June, July, and August, he requires 75° mornings and\r\nevenings, and 80° or 85° at noon. In September, after fire-heat becomes\r\nnecessary, he keeps as nearly to 65° as possible, and in sunshine, by\r\nthe free admission of air, to about 70° or 72°. In October, November,\r\nand December, he lowers the temperature to 60° mornings and evenings,\r\nand 65° in sunshine.\r\n\r\nAir is admitted at all seasons in fine sunshine weather, and freely, as\r\nthe fruit approaches to maturity, in order to enhance its flavour.\r\n\r\nHe gives water seldom in January, and not oftener than once in six or\r\neight days in February. In March, “water may given oftener than\r\nheretofore advised, and also in larger quantities; generally a moderate\r\nwatering at root once in three or four days, and a dewing over head\r\noccasionally, to refresh the leaves, and keep them clean from dust. From\r\nthe time the plants are out of flower, and the fruit begins to swell,\r\nwater must be applied in a very liberal manner once in two or three\r\ndays, always giving the necessary quantity at root, and then a dewing\r\nover head. Watering to this extent, however, if the fruit be not in too\r\nforward a state, will seldom be necessary before the end of the month,\r\nor till April.” In April, “water must be given in a plentiful manner,\r\nonce in two or three days, in order the better to swell off the fruit.\r\nThe roots have now much to do in sustaining it, and also the suckers,\r\nwhich will be fast advancing in growth. For this reason, water\r\nfrequently with dunghill-drainings, or with water of dung, soaked on\r\npurpose; and after each watering at root, give a dewing over the leaves,\r\nas directed above.” In May, June, and July, “from the time the fruit\r\nbegin to colour, however, begin also to lessen the quantity of water;\r\nand towards its being fit for cutting, withhold water entirely, else the\r\nflavour will be very much deteriorated. I shall here observe, with\r\nrespect to the different kinds of Pines, that the Queen and the\r\nSugar-loaf sorts require considerably more water than the King or\r\nHavannah, and the Antigua. The difference in the manner of watering\r\nshould be more particularly attended to as the fruit approach to\r\nmaturity; as the latter-named kinds are naturally more juicy and watery\r\nthan the former.” In August, the plants that have done fruiting being\r\nremoved, the succession stock which replace them are to be watered\r\nfreely at root, and occasionally dewed over top. In October and\r\nNovember, the waterings are gradually lessened; and in December, once in\r\neight, ten, or twelve days, will be sufficient.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ “If Pine plants,” Nicol observes, “by proper culture, be kept\r\nhealthy and vigorous, _insects will not annoy, but leave them_. This\r\nfact I have repeatedly proved, both with respect to the Pine, and to\r\nother plants that are liable to be affected with the coccus, (the only\r\ninsect that materially injures the Pine), which seems to delight in\r\ndisease and decay, as flies do in carrion.\r\n\r\n“I have received into my stock, plants covered with the _pine-bug_,\r\n(coccus hesperidum), without the smallest hesitation; made no effort\r\nwhatever to get rid of them; and by next shifting time, in two or three\r\nmonths, have seen no more of them. This I have not done once, but often;\r\nand I have known my brother do the same thing. In short, I never but\r\nonce in my life have tried any remedy for the _bug_; and as I was\r\ncompletely successful, I shall here give the recipe, which may safely be\r\napplied to Pine plants in any state; but certainly best to crowns and\r\nsuckers at striking them, or to others in the March shifting, when they\r\nare shaked out of their pots at any rate.\r\n\r\n“Take soft soap, one pound; flowers of sulphur, one pound; tobacco, half\r\na pound; nux vomica, an ounce; which boil all together in four English\r\ngallons of soft water to three, and set it aside to cool. In this liquor\r\nimmerse the whole plant, after the roots and leaves are trimmed for\r\npotting; and this is the whole matter. Plants in any other state, and\r\nwhich are placed in the bark-bed, may safely be watered over head with\r\nthis liquor; and as the _bug_ harbours most in the angles of the\r\nleaves, it stands the better chance of being effectual, on account that\r\nit will also there remain longest, and there its sediment will settle.\r\nIn using it in this latter way, however, if repeated waterings be\r\nnecessary, the liquor should be reduced in strength by the addition of a\r\nthird or a fourth part water.\r\n\r\n“The brown scaly insect, also a coccus, is often found on the Pine, and\r\nother stove plants; but I never could perceive that it does any other\r\ninjury than dirty them, and so is of less importance than the other\r\nspecies, which eats or corrodes the leaves, in so far as it leaves them\r\nfull of brown specks or blotches. The above liquor, however, is a remedy\r\nfor either, and indeed for most insects, on account of its strength, and\r\nglutinous nature.\r\n\r\n“Ants are also to be found in the Pinery; but I never could observe that\r\nthey do the plants any harm, though they are generally to be found in\r\nthe pots, and among the bark. They are most frequently to be met with\r\nthere, if the coccus be present; and seem to feed on its larvæ, or\r\nperhaps on its fæces.”\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ He does not state any determinate object as to this\r\nsubject; if the object be to have large fruit, he says, all suckers of\r\nthe root and stem must be twisted off; and to retard the progress of\r\nfruit that is shown too early, he recommends re-potting the plants in\r\nFebruary. He says, “If Pine Apples be not cut soon after they begin to\r\ncolour, that is, just when the fruit is of a greenish yellow, or straw\r\ncolour, they fall greatly off in flavour and richness; and that sharp\r\nluscious taste so much admired, becomes insipid.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. IX.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple, by Mr. William Griffin, Gardener to J.\r\n  C. Girardot, Esq. at Kelham, in Nottinghamshire, and now to Samuel\r\n  Smith, Esq. of Woodhall, in Hertfordshire._\r\n\r\nMr. Griffin has been a most successful cultivator of the Pine Apple;\r\nperhaps more so for the limited means which he possessed at Kelham, than\r\neither M’Phail or Baldwin.\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ This is so nearly that of Speechly, that we do not\r\nconsider it necessary to give the details.\r\n\r\n_Soil._ Mr. Griffin laughs at those who prescribe “many different\r\nstrange ingredients for composts;” adding, that, “after numerous\r\nexperiments made with mixtures of deers’, sheeps’, pigeons’, hens’, and\r\nrotten stable-dung, with soot, and other manures, in various proportions\r\nand combinations with fresh soil of different qualities from pastures\r\nand waste lands, I can venture with confidence to recommend the\r\nfollowing: Procure from a pasture, or waste land, a quantity of brown,\r\nrich, loamy earth, if of a reddish colour the better, but of a fattish\r\nmouldy temperature; that by squeezing a handful of it together, and\r\nopening your hand, it will readily fall apart again: be cautious not to\r\ngo deeper than you find it of that pliable texture; likewise procure,\r\nif possible, a quantity of deers’-dung: if none can be conveniently got,\r\nsheeps’-dung will do, and a quantity of swines’-dung. Let the above\r\nthree sorts be brought to some convenient place, and laid up in three\r\ndifferent heaps ridge-ways, for at least six months; and then mix them\r\nin the following manner, covering the dung with a little soil before it\r\nis mixed: four wheelbarrows of the above earth; one barrow of\r\nsheep’s-dung, and two barrows of swine’s-dung. This composition,” he\r\nadds, “if carefully and properly prepared, will answer every purpose for\r\nthe growth of Pine-plants of every age and kind. It is necessary that it\r\nshould remain a year before applied to use, that it may receive the\r\nadvantage of the summer’s sun and winter’s frost; and it need not be\r\nscreened or sifted before using, but only well broken with the hands and\r\nspade, as when finely sifted it becomes too compact for the roots of the\r\nplants.”\r\n\r\n_General management._ In rearing the young plants, he generally plants\r\nthe crowns in the bark till they have struck root; but the suckers he\r\npots at once, unless they are small and green at bottom, when he treats\r\nthem like the crowns. The pots he uses for both crowns and suckers are\r\nfive inches diameter, and four inches deep, unless the suckers are very\r\nstrong, when he puts them in pots seven inches and a quarter wide, by\r\nsix and a half inches deep. The plants are shifted in the March\r\nfollowing into pots nine inches in diameter, by eight inches deep,\r\n“turning each singly out of its present pot, with a ball of earth entire\r\naround its roots, unless any appear unhealthy or any ways defective,\r\nwhen it is eligible to shake the earth from the roots, and trim off all\r\nthe parts that appear not alive. He plunges them in the bark (refreshed\r\nas at each shifting) eighteen inches from plant to plant in the row, and\r\ntwenty inches distance row from row.”\r\n\r\nMr. Griffin shifts for the last time in the October of the year\r\npreceding them in which the fruit is expected; the pots he uses are\r\ntwelve inches in diameter, and ten inches deep. He plunges them in the\r\nbark-bed, about twenty inches plant from plant, and two feet distance\r\nfrom row to row. He says, “place the first row eighteen inches from the\r\nkirb, angling them in the rows as you go on.”\r\n\r\nIt is of some consequence to remark, that Griffin’s practice in not\r\ndivesting the plants at any one shifting of their balls of earth,\r\ndiffers from that of Speechly, Nicol, and most other practitioners,\r\nexcepting Baldwin. It appears highly probable, that by not disturbing\r\nthe balls of healthy plants, they will produce their fruit both earlier\r\nand of a larger size; for the cutting off the roots must produce a check\r\nin the growth of the plant, and their renewal must occupy its chief\r\nenergies for some time, and thus lessen the vigour of the leaves; since\r\nthe leaves and roots of all plants assist each other alternately as\r\noccasion requires.\r\n\r\nThose who advocate the practice of shaking off the balls of earth, and\r\ncutting off the roots of Pines in the second year’s spring shifting,\r\nsay, that though, at first sight, it has an unnatural appearance, yet,\r\non more minute enquiry, it will be found congenial to nature. In the\r\nfirst place, they say that they only cut away the lower decaying roots,\r\nand preserve all the others, unless they are bruised by the shaking off\r\nthe ball; or injured by disease, or otherwise. In the next place, they\r\nstate, that on attentively examining the Pine-plant, it will be found,\r\nthat, in its mode of rooting, it may be classed with the strawberry,\r\nvine, and crowfoot, which throw out fresh roots every year, in part\r\namong, but chiefly above, the old ones. This done, the old ones become\r\ntorpid and decay, and to cut them clear away, if it could be done in all\r\nplants of this habit, would, it is said, be assisting nature, and\r\ncontribute to the growth of the new roots. At the same time, it is to be\r\nobserved, that encouraging, in any extraordinary degree, the production\r\nof roots, though it will ultimately increase the vigour of the herb and\r\nfruit, will retard their progress to maturity.\r\n\r\nSpeechly has the following judicious observations in allusion to those\r\nwho recommend always shifting with the balls entire.\r\n\r\n“First, It is observable, that the Pine-plant begins to make its roots\r\nat the very bottom of the stem, and as the plant increases in size,\r\nfresh roots are produced from the stem, still higher and higher; and the\r\nbottom roots die in proportion: so that, if a plant in the greatest\r\nvigour be turned out of its pot as soon as the fruit is cut, there will\r\nbe found at the bottom a part of the stem, several inches in length,\r\nnaked, destitute of roots, and smooth: now, according to the above\r\nmethod, the whole of the roots which the plant produces being permitted\r\nto remain on the stem to the last, the old roots decay and turn mouldy,\r\nto the great detriment of those afterwards produced.\r\n\r\n“Secondly, The first ball which remains with the plant full two years,\r\nby length of time will become hard, cloddy, and exhausted of its\r\nnourishment, and must, therefore, prevent the roots afterwards produced\r\nfrom growing with that freedom and vigour, which they would do in\r\nfresher and better mould.\r\n\r\n“Thirdly, The old ball continually remaining after the frequent\r\nshiftings, it will be too large when put into the fruiting-pot, to admit\r\nof a sufficient quantity of fresh mould to support the plant till its\r\nfruit becomes ripe, which is generally a whole year from the last time\r\nof shifting.”\r\n\r\nIn giving air and water, Mr. Griffin differs nothing from Nicol; he\r\nwaters moderately in winter, and more liberally in the growing season,\r\nfrom March till October; want of water to keep the plants moist, he\r\nconsiders one of the reasons of their showing fruit prematurely. He\r\nnever waters over the leaves in any stage, nor gives much at the roots\r\nin damp weather.\r\n\r\nWith respect to temperature, this author differs from most others who\r\nhave written on the Pine, but not from many very successful\r\npractitioners. He recommends 60° as the heat proper for the Pine in\r\nevery stage, not exceeding five or six degrees over or under. The bottom\r\nheat, which he considers proper, is from 90° to 100°. _Treatise on the\r\nPine Apple_, p. 60. and 66.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ After many trials and experiments, he found the following the\r\nmost effectual wash for destroying insects on Pines:--\r\n\r\n“To one gallon of soft rain-water, add eight ounces of soft green soap,\r\none ounce of tobacco, and three table spoonfuls of turpentine; stir and\r\nmix them well together in a watering-pot, and let them stand for a day\r\nor two. When you are going to use this mixture, stir and mix it well\r\nagain, then strain it through a thin cloth. If the fruit only is\r\ninfested, dash the mixture over the crown and fruit, with a squirt,\r\nuntil all is fairly wet; and what runs down the stem of the fruit will\r\nkill all the insects that are amongst the bottom of the leaves. When\r\nyoung plants are infested, take them out of their pots, and shaking all\r\nthe earth from the roots, (tying the leaves of the largest plants\r\ntogether,) and plunge them into the above mixture, keeping every part\r\ncovered for the space of five minutes; then take them out, and set them\r\non a clean place, with their tops declining downwards, for the mixture\r\nto drain out of their centre. When the plants are dry, put them into\r\nsmaller pots than before, and plunge them into the bark-bed.”\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ Mr. Griffin’s object seems to have been to produce\r\nlarge fruit in the proper season. In the year 1802, when gardener to J.\r\nC. Girardot, Esq. at Kelham, near Nottingham, he cut twenty Queen Pines,\r\nwhich weighed together eighty-seven pounds seven ounces. In 1803, one\r\nweighing five pounds three ounces. In July, 1804, one of the New\r\nProvidence kind, weighing seven pounds two ounces. In August, 1804, one\r\nof the same kind, weighing nine pounds three ounces. And in 1805, he cut\r\ntwenty-two Queen Pines, which weighed together one hundred and eighteen\r\npounds three ounces.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. X.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple, by Mr. Thomas Baldwin, Gardener to the\r\n  Marquis of Hertford, at Ragley, in Warwickshire, from 1805 to the\r\n  present time._\r\n\r\nMr. Baldwin is reputed the first Pine cultivator in England; he has\r\ngiven some account of his practice in a tract of a few pages, which,\r\nbeing sold much above the usual price of printed books, never obtained\r\nso much circulation as manuscript copies of it, which were handed about\r\namong the principal Pine-growers near London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 11]\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ The succession, or nursing pits, according to Mr.\r\nBaldwin’s plan (fig. 11.), in which the young plants are to remain both\r\nwinter and summer, should be constructed of timber, seven feet wide, and\r\nseven feet three inches high at the back, the front being in the same\r\nproportion. The method of preparing the bed is as follows:--“Sink your\r\npit (2.) three feet three inches deep, as long as you require, and\r\nsufficiently broad to admit of linings on each side (1, 1.); make a good\r\ndrain at the bottom of the pit to keep it dry; then set posts, about the\r\ndimensions of six inches square, in the pit, at convenient distances,\r\n(say about the width of the top lights,) and case it round with one inch\r\nand a half deal wrought boards, above the surface, and below with any\r\ninferior boards or planks. The dimensions of my succession-bed or frame,\r\nare thirty-nine feet long, and seven feet wide; containing two hundred\r\nand seventy-three square feet, which will hold three hundred and fifty\r\nsuckers, from the end of September till the seventh of April.”\r\n\r\n_Soil._ “From old pasture or meadow ground strip off the turf, and dig\r\nto the depth of six or eight inches, according to the goodness of the\r\nsoil; draw the whole together to some convenient place, and mix it with\r\none-half of good rotten dung; frequently turn it over for twelve months,\r\nand it will be fit for use. This is the only compost dung for young and\r\nold plants.”\r\n\r\n_General management._ The general practice of Mr. Baldwin is to take the\r\nsuckers from the fruiting plants about the end of September, and lay\r\nthem in a warm place for about three days; he then pulls off a few of\r\ntheir bottom leaves, which makes them ready for planting. “In making\r\nyour bed,” he says, “lay three-fourths of new tan at the bottom of the\r\npit, and lay old tan upon that, to reach within three inches of the top;\r\non the surface of this sift old tan to the thickness of three inches,\r\nbeating it down well with the spade, then plant the suckers in the tan\r\nabout four or five inches apart, according to the size of the plants,\r\nplacing the tallest in the backside of the frame, and the shortest in\r\nthe front. In this situation let them remain till the month of April\r\nfollowing; then take up the plants out of the tan-bed, and divest them\r\nof all their root; and remember that at any future transplanting the\r\nroots must not be taken off. Plant them in pots of five, six, and seven\r\ninches diameter, according to the size of the plants, but before\r\nplanting let the pots be filled with the prepared compost already\r\nmentioned. About the middle of June following, when the pots are\r\nbeginning to be filled with roots, take out the plants with their balls\r\nwhole, and plant them in pots about nine inches in diameter, being\r\nfilled with the same rich compost, replanting them into the bed, and let\r\nthem remain there till the end of September. Be careful at each\r\ntransplanting, while the plants are out of the beds, to have the beds\r\nput into a proper state by the addition of fresh tan, &c.\r\n\r\n“When the plants are out of the stoves in the month of September,\r\nprepare the pits in the same manner as directed for the succession-beds,\r\nwith three-fourths of new tan at the bottom, &c.; then shift the plants\r\ninto pots about fourteen inches diameter at the top, and plant them at\r\nsuitable distances for fruiting; plunge the pots at first halfway into\r\nthe tan, till the heat diminishes to a safe temperature, then fill up\r\nthe interstices between the pots with tan, and as the plants are now\r\nstationed, let them so remain till they are fruited off for the table.\r\nThe plants, young and old, had best be near the glass, and small stoves\r\nare to be preferred, because they require less fire. The glass should be\r\nclosely puttied, to keep out the cold air, and to retain the warm.\r\n\r\n“The fruiting-house during the winter should be kept at about seventy of\r\nFahrenheit’s scale. It may be left in the evening about seventy-five,\r\nand it will be found in the morning about sixty-five, so that no\r\nattendance during the night will be necessary.\r\n\r\n“There should be no water given to the young suckers from September till\r\nApril, while they remain in the tan without pots. After they are potted\r\nthey require to be watered two or three times a week during the summer,\r\naccording as the temperature may be. When they are removed into the\r\nfruiting-house in September, they should be watered cautiously till\r\ntowards February, and as the spring advances they will require a large\r\nsupply. Never water the plants in the common broad-cast method, over\r\ntheir heads and leaves.\r\n\r\n“Give air in the stoves and frames, both in summer and winter, when the\r\nweather will permit, from the back and ends, but not from the roof.\r\n\r\n“_Expeditious cultivation._ The New Providence, Black Antigua, Jamaica,\r\nand Enville, and the other large sorts of Ananas, will require the\r\ncultivation of three years to bring them to perfection, but the Old\r\nQueen and the Ripley’s New Queen may be brought to perfection in fifteen\r\nmonths. To effect this, it must be observed, that some of the plants\r\nwill fruit in February, or the beginning of March, and consequently that\r\nthe suckers may be taken off in June, or the beginning of July; make\r\nthen a good bed of tan with linings of litter round the outside to keep\r\nin the tan; make the bed to fit a large melon frame; put the suckers\r\ninto pots of about nine inches diameter, filled with the compost; plunge\r\nthem into the bed prepared in regular order, and throw a mat over them\r\nin hot weather for shade till they have taken root; let them remain till\r\nthe end of September, and then shift them into pots of about twelve\r\ninches diameter, and plunge them in the fruiting-house.” He has had fine\r\ncrops of Pines raised from these suckers, many of them four pounds each,\r\nfrom plants only fifteen months old. “This method, in point both of\r\ntime and expence, has greatly the advantage of the common plan of\r\nraising Pines in three years by fires, when the fruit at last is\r\nfrequently small and ill-flavoured.”\r\n\r\n“It is a peculiar recommendation of this plan, that the plants reared in\r\nframes without fire, the first year seldom or never run to fruit;\r\nwhereas, on the contrary, when stoves are used first for a nursery for\r\nyoung plants, and next for succession plants, and lastly, for plants for\r\nthe fruiting-house, it is seldom that one-third of the plants come to\r\nthe forcing-house, because so many of them have run to fruit; and even\r\nthose that stand are necessarily dried and stunted, being subjected to\r\nthe attacks of various insects; not to mention the enormous care and\r\nexpence attendant upon a three years’ cultivation. The above appears to\r\nme to be the most easy and economical plan to raise Pines; one-third of\r\nthe coals are sufficient, and less than one-half of the labour and\r\nbuildings required for that purpose.” _Culture of the Ananas_, p. 28.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ After, as usual, many fruitless attempts, he at last\r\ndiscovered the following method: “Take horse-dung from the stable, the\r\nfresher the better, sufficient to make a hot-bed three feet high, to\r\nreceive a melon frame three feet deep at the back; put on the frame and\r\nlights immediately, and cover the whole with mats to bring up the heat.\r\nWhen the bed is at the strongest heat, take some faggots, open them,\r\nand spread the sticks over the surface of the bed on the dung, so as to\r\nkeep the plants from being scorched; set the plants or suckers bottom\r\nuppermost on the sticks; shut down your lights quite close, and cover\r\nthem over well with double mats, to keep in the steam. Let the plants\r\nremain in this state one hour, then take out the plants and wash them in\r\ncold water previously brought to the side of your bed, set them in a dry\r\nplace with their tops downwards to drain, and afterwards plant them.\r\nThis treatment is sure to kill every insect. You will observe likewise,\r\nthat if your suckers are kept in the frames all the winter, stuck in the\r\ntan without soil or fire, the effluvia from the linings are sure to kill\r\nall the bugs.” _Culture of the Ananas_, p. 33.\r\n\r\n_Fruit Produced._ The general crop is produced in the usual season, viz.\r\nfrom June to September, or October; but some are produced every month in\r\nthe year. The large sorts, as the New Providence, &c. require three\r\nyears to bring them to perfection, but the Old Queen, and Ripley’s New\r\nQueen, may be brought to perfection in three months; though from the\r\ncircumstances requisite to render this practicable, viz. plants fruiting\r\nin February, or the beginning of March, it must be considered more a\r\nmatter of accident or curiosity than of any real advantage. It is\r\nevident, at all events, that it can never become general; for certainly\r\nno gardener would desire all his plants to come into fruit in February\r\nor March. Mr. Baldwin grows his fruit to a very considerable size even\r\nwhen produced in so short a period. “At a meeting of the Horticultural\r\nSociety of London, held in October, 1817, T. Baldwin, gardener to the\r\nMarquis of Hertford, at Ragley, presented a Queen Pine of great beauty\r\nand superior flavor. It measured sixteen inches in circumference, seven\r\ninches in length, and weighed four pounds. The plant on which it was\r\nproduced was little more than fifteen months old.” _Hort. Tr._ vol. iii.\r\np. 118.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._ The following judicious remarks on Mr. Baldwin’s plan are by\r\nMr. M’Phail. “Mr. Baldwin’s method,” he says, “appears to differ nothing\r\nin principle from the methods I practised; but we differ a little in\r\npractice, that is, in the manner of the application of the elements\r\nnecessary to make the plants grow fast and vigorous, and to produce fine\r\nfruit; and likewise in the mode of disrooting and planting, which\r\ndifference I conceive to be of little consequence. He grows his plants\r\nin good earth, enriched with plenty of well-rotted manure. He keeps the\r\nplants in a strong heat, and gives their roots plenty of water. He sets\r\nhis fruiting plants in a bed of tan in the month of September, and there\r\nit appears they are stationed till the fruit be ripened the following\r\nsummer. Now, I think, a bed made up in September, is not able to retain\r\na sufficient heat for the growth of the Pine Apple plant for so long a\r\nperiod of time.\r\n\r\n“Once, by way of experiment, in a small hot-house, I made up a bed in\r\nthe pit of it in the month of October, and laid upon the surface of the\r\nbed one foot thick of good earth, and turned out of their pots fine Pine\r\nApple plants, intended to fruit the succeeding year, and I set the\r\nplants into the earth on the surface of the bed with the balls of earth\r\nabout their roots undisturbed. In this situation they grew exceedingly\r\nwell, and shewed fruit very strong, but the heat in the bed under them\r\nbecame too faint in the month of April: and with all the atmospherical\r\nheat that I could give them, the fruit did not ripen well for want of\r\nheat to the roots of the plants; and I was not able to contrive any\r\nmethod to recruit it, which required to be done in the month of March or\r\nApril.\r\n\r\n“According to the foregoing account, this celebrated and experienced\r\ngardener plants the suckers of the Pine Apple in the latter end of\r\nSeptember, and he divests them of all their roots in the month of April.\r\nIn this method of process I must differ from him, because the young\r\nplants have only six months (being the slowest growing months of the\r\nyear) to make roots, and then these roots are entirely cut off, which\r\nconsiderably retards the plants in their growth. And, according to his\r\nmethod, and mine also, the queen and some other sorts of the Pine, ripen\r\ntheir fruit in a shorter period of time than two years after planting.\r\nHe says, he never waters his Pine plants in the broad-cast way over\r\ntheir heads and leaves. In this I also differ with him, for I think,\r\ngiving the plants water all over their leaves occasionally, especially\r\nin hot weather, is of service to them, and which indeed is only\r\nimitating nature.\r\n\r\n“I say not that Pine Apple plants will not do well without giving them\r\nwater all over their leaves, for if hot-houses be kept in a good state\r\nof temperature for the growth of the Pine Apple, the great evaporation\r\nof the tan-bed, and of the moist earth about the roots of the plants,\r\nmay supply the leaves sufficiently with water, especially in houses\r\nmanaged in the way this real practical gardener says he manages his Pine\r\nplants; that is, his hot-houses are very close, and he admits no air at\r\nthe roof, so that the moist air which ascends up is thrown back among\r\nthe plants. I would here remark, that when Pine Apple plants are watered\r\nall over their leaves when in fruit, the water should not be suffered to\r\nstand long in the heart of the crowns on the fruit, which it will seldom\r\ndo if the heat in the house be good, but with a little care the plants\r\nmay be watered all over their leaves, without letting it fall on the\r\nfruit, or the crowns of them.\r\n\r\n“He recommends that beds for the culture of the Pine Apple be built of\r\nwood: excepting it be oak, which is dear, other sorts of timber will not\r\nlast long in such a situation; and therefore, for this and other\r\nreasons, (given in Section VII. page 67), I think beds built of brick,\r\nin a similar way to the one I invented, are preferable, and in the end\r\ncheaper than those of wood.\r\n\r\n“With regard to the method which this gardener useth to destroy insects\r\non Pine Apple plants, it is a troublesome operation, and can be\r\npractised only on young plants, and indeed, according to his own\r\naccount, insects on the Pine Apple may be destroyed in the course of\r\ntheir culture, which coincides exactly with the methods I used and\r\nrecommend to be carried into practice by those who have the management\r\nof Pine Apple plants, and are troubled with insects. I have no doubt but\r\nhis method of laying young plants in a hot-bed of rank dung, will\r\neffectually destroy the insects, though I think, however, they had best\r\nremain in the bed longer than one hour; but perhaps remaining even an\r\nhour, or a longer time, in such a dreadful situation, where I conceive\r\nno animal could long exist, might hurt the plants, if not destroy them.\r\nBut let it be remembered, that if Pine plants be perfectly free of\r\ninsects, if they are put into a hot-house where the scale or the bug\r\ninsects are in the tan, or in any part of the house, the insects will\r\nfind their way to creep to the Pines and breed upon them; for these\r\ninsects are natural to the plant.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XI.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple as given in Abercrombie’s Practical\r\n  Gardener, edited by Mr. James Mean, head gardener to Sir Abraham\r\n  Hume, Bart. at Wormleybury, in Hertfordshire._\r\n\r\nThe culture of the Pine Apple was given by John Abercrombie, in his\r\n“Every man his own Gardener,” when that work was originally published\r\nin 1780; but we prefer taking it from the work above cited, as giving\r\nthe modern practice. It is proper to observe, however, that the\r\ndirections in the “Practical Gardener” are much less to be depended on\r\nthan those given by M’Phail and Baldwin; for as the first of these\r\nauthors observes, in his preface to the Gardener’s Remembrancer, the\r\nPractical Gardener has been evidently dressed up, and in some parts\r\nrather affectedly, by some man who knew little of the practice of\r\ngardening. As to what Mr. Mean may have done in revising the book, it is\r\nmore certain that he has not done enough, than that he has done any\r\nthing, for there are many passages, besides those pointed out by\r\nM’Phail, that appear quite ridiculous as coming from a practical\r\ngardener. Notwithstanding these faults, however, which would have\r\nescaped unnoticed in a less valuable book, “The Practical Gardener” is\r\nthe best book of its kind extant.\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ “The fruiting-house,” he says, “need not be higher than\r\nfive feet in front, and eight feet six inches at the back wall; or,\r\nwhatever be the breadth of the house, the difference between the height\r\nin front and in rear, need not exceed one-third of the breadth.” By this\r\nmeans the chamber of air to be heated will be materially reduced. To\r\ngive a full command over the temperature of this air, let the lappings\r\nof the panes of glass be closed with putty.\r\n\r\nThe roof of the succession-house may be four or six inches lower than\r\nthat of the fruiting-house; and the roof of the nursing-pit may be a\r\nfoot lower than that of the fruiting-house.\r\n\r\n_Soil._ The soil recommended is nearly the same as that used by Nicol.\r\nIt consists of:--“1. Vegetable mould; 2. The top-spit earth from an\r\nupland pasture, loamy, friable, and well reduced; 3. Hard-fed dung,\r\nrotted and mellowed by at least a year’s preparation; 4. Small, pearly\r\nriver-gravel; 5. White sea-sand; 6. Shell-marl.\r\n\r\n“If no vegetable mould has been provided, light rich earth, from a\r\nfallowed part of the kitchen garden, may be substituted: there is no\r\ndifference of any account between one and the other, further than this:\r\nThe vegetable mould is sure to be virgin earth, from which no aliment\r\nhas been extracted; the mould from the kitchen garden, however you may\r\ntrench, and rest, and enrich it, cannot but contain many particles which\r\nhave given out their fertilizing qualities to previous crops. Dung\r\nperfectly decomposed comes to the same thing as vegetable mould;\r\ntherefore that one of them which is most attainable, or best prepared,\r\nmay fitly serve instead of the other.\r\n\r\n“Of the first three take equal quantities; making three-fourths of the\r\nintended compost. Constitute the remaining fourth thus: Let\r\nriver-gravel, sea-sand, and shell-marl, furnish each a twelfth part. The\r\nsmall gravel is to afford something for the roots to lay hold of; the\r\nsea-sand, to promote lightness and dryness; the shell-marl, the better\r\nto support the growth of fibres and integuments and parts not pulpy.\r\nMix with the whole a fortieth part soot, to offend and repel worms.\r\nIncorporate the ingredients fully; and turn the heap two or three times\r\nbefore using it.”\r\n\r\n_General management._ “As soon as either crowns or suckers are detached\r\nfrom the parent plant, directions are given to twist off some of the\r\nleaves about the base; the vacancy, thus made, at the bottom of the\r\nstem, is to favour the emission of roots. Pare the stump smooth; then\r\nlay the intended plants on a shelf in a shaded part of the stove, or of\r\nthe green-house, or of any dry apartment. Let crowns and fruit off-sets\r\nlie till the part that adhered to the fruit is perfectly healed; and\r\nroot-suckers, in the same manner, till the part which was united to the\r\nold stock is become dry and firm. They will be fit to plant in five or\r\nsix days. As to the prolonged period for which they may remain out of\r\nculture: Pine-plants have been kept six months without mould, in a\r\nmoderately warm dry state, and the only injury has been loss of time.\r\nCrowns or suckers coming off before Michaelmas should be planted without\r\nany unnecessary delay, to get established before, the winter. When\r\nlate-fruiting plants do not afford off-sets till after Michaelmas, it is\r\nbest to keep them in a dormant state during the months least favourable\r\nto artificial culture: therefore, as you obtain these late off-sets,\r\nhang them up in the house, not too near the flues, to rest till March.”\r\n\r\n_Insects._ Mr. Nicol’s method, and also that by M’Phail, are both quoted\r\nwith approbation. The following wash is directed to be applied\r\nexclusively to the building, and by no means to the plants. “At the\r\nannual cleansing of the house, if insects are supposed to breed in the\r\nbuilding, introduce the wash with a brush into the cracks and joints of\r\nthe wood-work, and the crevices of the wall.\r\n\r\n_Recipe for the Wash._ “Of sulphur vivum take 2 oz. soft soap, 4 oz.\r\nMake these into a lather, mixed with a gallon of water that has been\r\npoured in a boiling state upon a pound of mercury. The mercury will\r\nlast, to medicate fresh quantities of water, almost perpetually.”\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ To ripen eminently large fruit, he directs the removal\r\nor destruction of suckers; to retard the progress of fruit that have\r\nappeared too early, he shifts in Nicol’s manner; and when fruit is\r\nripening too fast, or too many advancing to a ripe state together, he\r\nretards a part of the plants by setting them into a dry airy place,\r\naffording both shade and shelter. “Give no water as long as you wish to\r\nsuspend their progress. For the same purpose, others may be set out\r\ngreen; but whilst the excitement of these is lowered, they must be kept\r\nin a growing state.” _Practical Gardener_, 643.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XII.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple by Mr. James Andrews, commercial\r\n  gardener, Vauxhall._\r\n\r\nMr. Andrews has been considered the best grower of Pines in the\r\nneighbourhood of London for many years; his principal object is to grow\r\nfruit for the market; but the demand for the plants by private\r\ngardeners, and others, has generally been so great, that he can seldom\r\nkeep the plants till the last stage of their growth.\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ Both pits and larger houses are used; but there is\r\nnothing particular in the form of either. Mr. Andrews seldom erects new\r\nwork, but generally purchases old hot-houses and sashes at the sales of\r\ndecayed gentlemen, or bankrupt tradesmen. In this respect he follows the\r\npractice of Mr. Lee of Hammersmith, and both have generally a stock of\r\nold sashes and rafters on hand ready to put up when wanted. But though\r\nthe form of Mr. Andrews’ houses may be said to be in a great degree\r\nmatter of accident, yet the arrangement of the flues within is his own.\r\nThese generally enter at the front corner of one end, pass to the\r\nopposite end, return along the back wall, where they sometimes serve as\r\na path, and at other times are placed at one side of the path,\r\noccasionally a return is made, and the chimney-top is formed in the back\r\nwall, at the opposite end to that in which the fire enters; when this is\r\nnot the case, the smoke passes off by the back wall at the same end.\r\nThe width of the pit depends on the room left by the flue; to increase\r\nit no path is formed at the ends or in front, and that along the back\r\nwall does not exceed two feet in width. The depth of the pits is from\r\ntwo feet and a half to three feet deep, and their distance from the\r\nglass from four to six feet. Vines are trained up the rafters and over\r\nthe back path. The sashes in front open in various ways, and air is\r\ngiven by them, and by the sliding sashes of the roof. On the whole, Mr.\r\nAndrews’ best houses greatly resemble those of Mr. Gunter, to be\r\ndescribed in the following section.\r\n\r\nIn the pits there is nothing uncommon in the construction; they are, in\r\ngeneral, sunk deep in the ground, which being dry at bottom, is a great\r\nsaving of heat. In some the tan is enclosed by brick walls, in others by\r\na frame of wood; some are without flues, but the greater number have a\r\nflue in front, or a steam tube, or both.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1817, Mr. Andrews tried the effect of steam, and was so much\r\nsatisfied with it, that in the following year, he put up an extensive\r\napparatus in the centre of his forcing department, from which\r\nbranch-pipes proceed in all directions, and heat the air in the whole of\r\nhis hot-houses, pits, and frames.\r\n\r\n_Soil._ As near as possible that of Baldwin’s, or M’Phail’s;--a rich\r\nloam, rendered sufficiently free by coarse sand, to admit the ready\r\npassage of the water.\r\n\r\n_General management._ The crowns and suckers, when they are detached at\r\nirregular seasons, as in winter, or very early in spring, are planted in\r\nany spare corner of the bark bed, till a number is collected, when they\r\nare planted in pots, according to their sizes, and plunged in common\r\nhot-beds, or pits. Mr. Andrews has no particular months for shifting, no\r\nfixed sizes of pots, and no predetermined manipulation as to shaking the\r\nplants out of their balls, or otherwise. He is present at every\r\noperation himself, and acts as the case requires. He encourages forward\r\nplants, by giving them larger pots than the rest; sometimes he looks\r\nover the nursing-pits, and selects the most vigorous plants, shifts\r\nthem, and puts them into a stronger heat, leaving the others for some\r\nweeks longer: the balls of earth he does not disturb, if they do not\r\nappear hard, the roots injured, or the plant enfeebled. Sometimes he\r\ntakes off the bottom of the ball, and the bottom roots, paring off any\r\npart of the stump of the plant which may appear decaying; at other\r\ntimes, he contents himself with removing the surface-mould, and\r\ntop-dressing. In general, he places the plants somewhat deeper in the\r\npots at each shifting.\r\n\r\nThe plants which he removes to the fruiting-houses are shifted, for the\r\nlast time, about nine months before the fruit is expected; their pots\r\nare generally twelve or fourteen inches in diameter; but not of the\r\nusual proportion in depth, to lessen the risk of overheating from the\r\ntan. The depth is generally the same as the width. The pots are plunged\r\nup to their rims, unless the heat be very violent, and are liberally\r\nsupplied with heat, air, and water. Mr. Andrews does not fear 90° or\r\n100° degrees of heat in the bark bed, even when the air of the house by\r\nfire-heat is not above 60° or 65°. In summer, he allows the thermometer\r\nto rise to 90° or a 100° before he gives air, and he often leaves some\r\nat the top-lights all night.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ On this subject nothing new can be gathered from the practice\r\nof Mr. Andrews, for he has never had any worth destroying by a regular\r\nprocess. His practice affords an ample proof that regimen and\r\ncleanliness will never allow insects to increase to an injurious degree.\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ We have already noticed the circumstance of Mr.\r\nAndrews’ plants being often sold before they arrive at the stage for\r\nfruiting. His stock, however, has been lately greatly increased by the\r\nerection of additional houses, and the easy mode of heating them from\r\nthe steam apparatus; he now, therefore, sends a number to market, and\r\nchiefly in the winter season, and early in spring, when the price is\r\nhighest. Their fruit weigh from one to four pounds, and are almost\r\nexclusively of the Queen Pine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIII.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple, as practised by Mr. Gunter, at\r\n  Earlscourt, near Kensington; Mr. Grange, at Kingsland; and Mr.\r\n  Wilmot, of Isleworth._\r\n\r\nThe family of Mr. Gunter have long possessed the very extensive gardens\r\nof Earlscourt, and grown in them kitchen vegetables, excellent hardy\r\nfruits, and melons, for the London market; but it is only within the\r\nlast seven years that they have commenced the culture of the Pine Apple\r\nfor the same purpose. This Mr. R. Gunter has done on the most liberal\r\nand extensive scale, and with great and merited success.\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ Like Mr. Andrews, Mr. Gunter uses both pits and large\r\nhouses; in the pits he both nurses the plants, and fruits them, and in\r\nthe large houses he fruits the Pine Apple, and produces very early\r\ngrapes at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 12]\r\n\r\nThe large houses (fig. 12.) are, in what may be called the usual form;\r\nthey differ from M’Phail’s, and the houses built by Speechly, and\r\noriginally by Nicol, in not having a path in front; and from those of\r\nMr. Aiton, erected in the royal gardens at Kensington, in the pit being\r\nfarther from the glass. They are about fourteen feet wide inside\r\nmeasure; the pit is ten feet three inches wide, three feet deep, three\r\nand a half feet from the glass in front (_a_), and about six feet and a\r\nhalf behind (_b_). The back path (_c_) is a border regularly dug and\r\nmanured, to encourage the roots of the vines, which pass under the bark\r\nbed to the front border. Each house is forty feet long, and has a flue\r\nproceeding from the back wall to the front, and along the front to the\r\nopposite end, returning to the back wall in the usual manner. As the\r\nhouses are all heated by steam, however, these flues are erected merely\r\nby way of security, in case of any accident happening to the boiler or\r\nthe pipes (_d_, _e_), and are therefore seldom used. Besides the vines\r\ntrained over the back path, there are others which are led up the\r\nrafters; both root into excellent soil, and their shoots are withdrawn\r\nin autumn to give them three months’ rest in the open air. Those at the\r\nback wall are withdrawn through an opening in the angle of the upper\r\nsash; those in front through an angle of the front sash.\r\n\r\nThe pits are sunk in the ground to the sill of the sashes in front, and\r\nwithin eighteen inches, or two feet of the sill behind. In all of them,\r\nthe tan is inclosed by brick walls; they are generally about seven feet\r\nwide within walls, but some are as wide as fourteen feet, with the front\r\nwall six inches above ground, and the back wall two feet ten inches. The\r\nsashes in these broad pits are in two lengths, as in hot-house roofs;\r\nnone of them have any flues, being all heated together, with the\r\nhot-houses, and various other descriptions of pits, by an extensive\r\nsteam apparatus. This apparatus was erected by Mr. Mainwaring, of\r\nBlackfriars, and is one of the most complete of its kind, excepting in\r\nthe circumstance of the steam-pipes having what are technically called\r\n_spigott_ and _faucet_ joints, which, it is alleged, are more apt, by\r\ntheir contraction and expansion, to allow the escape of the steam than\r\nthe _flanched_ joints. The advantage of the former mode of jointing is,\r\nthat the steam-tube contracts and expands in parts; and, of course, that\r\nthis contraction and expansion must be very trifling on every part;\r\nwhereas, when iron tubes are joined by flanches, they become, in effect,\r\none tube; and the contraction, or expansion, takes place throughout\r\ntheir whole length.\r\n\r\n_Soil._ Good garden earth, enriched with well-rotted hot-bed dung; the\r\nsoil of the open garden at Earlscourt, is a rich black loam, and seems\r\nto suit the Pine Apple as well as virgin earth brought from a distance.\r\n\r\n_General management._ Much the same as that of Mr. Andrews. Mr. Gunter\r\ntried to substitute the heat of steam for that of tan, as a bottom heat,\r\nbut did not succeed. He formed a chamber, or vacuity of about six\r\ninches in depth, and covered it with perforated oak-plank; on this he\r\nplaced the earth, in which, in some cases, he turned the plants out of\r\nthe pots; and, in others, plunged the pots in the earth, or in rotten\r\ntan. The steam was admitted to fill the chamber; the quantity of heat\r\nimparted to the earth was very great, but, contrary to his expectation,\r\nno vapour ascended into the mould, which became excessively dry and\r\nhusky; nor was he able, by frequent waterings, to keep it in a state fit\r\nfor vegetation; the roots of the plants in it, in spite of every\r\nprecaution, become shrivelled and dry.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ None of any consequence have yet appeared at Earlscourt, nor\r\nis it likely they will ever become numerous there, while steam is used.\r\nWere they to become ever so abundant, keeping the air of the house\r\nfilled with steam for two or three days together, would effectually\r\ndestroy them.\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ The object of every commercial gardener is to have\r\nsome fruit ripening in every month of the year, but especially in\r\nwinter, when the price is high. In summer great numbers are imported, or\r\nsent in from the hired-out gardens of country gentlemen, which greatly\r\nreduces the market value below the real value, or actual cost of\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nThe Pine Apple is extensively cultivated by Mr. Grange, of Kingsland,\r\nand Mr. Wilmot, of Isleworth, in nearly the same manner as by Mr.\r\nAndrews and Mr. Gunter. Those of Mr. Wilmot’s are, at present, in the\r\nmost luxuriant and prosperous state; Mr. Grange’s are also in a very\r\nrespectable condition. In both, the plants are grown and fruited in\r\npits, and larger houses, which resemble those of Earlscourt (fig. 12.)\r\nas nearly as possible; in both, also, the heat is communicated by steam.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XIV.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple, by Mr. Isaac Oldacre, gardener to Lady\r\n  Banks, at Spring-grove, Middlesex._\r\n\r\nMr. Oldacre is an excellent kitchen-gardener, and an ingenious and\r\ncurious man. He was several years head-gardener at one of the Emperor of\r\nRussia’s residences near Petersburg, and has the merit of having\r\nintroduced from that country, the German mode of rearing mushrooms.\r\nHaving returned to this country about the year 1813, for his health, he\r\nsome years afterwards became gardener to Sir Joseph Banks, in whose\r\ngardens he has cultivated the Pine Apple with moderately good success,\r\nand we have introduced this Section on purpose to notice some\r\npeculiarities of treatment which he adopts, and some strange opinions\r\nwhich he holds, or lately held.\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ The plants are brought forward in dung, or tan-frames,\r\nor hot-beds, and also in flued-pits; but generally fruited in houses\r\ncombining the culture of the Vine and the Pine. Mr. Oldacre has two of\r\nthese houses, one is built of timber, in the usual way, (fig. 13.) and\r\nthe other is of the same form, but roofed with copper sashes. A full\r\ncommand over the air of these houses is obtained by the returns made by\r\nthe flue in the back path (_a_); the curb of the pit is about three feet\r\nfrom the glass in front (_b_); and about five feet from it behind (_c_);\r\nvines are trained up the rafters, but none are grown in the back path\r\n(_e_), which is paved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the flues, steam is also employed as a medium of\r\ncommunicating heat. But the apparatus was erected chiefly as matter of\r\npatriotism, when steam first came in vogue, and is on a very imperfect\r\nplan, and of little real use. The boilers are placed over the furnaces,\r\nand the same fire which heats the water of the boiler, passes along the\r\nflue; the steam tube of the boiler is laid on the top of the flue, and\r\nextends no farther than it extends. It is evident, therefore, that\r\nscarcely any advantage can result from the use of the boiler, unless it\r\nbe that the heat is thus sent more effectually to the opposite end of\r\nthe house to that at which the fire enters, or that the vapour is very\r\nreadily admitted from the steam-pipe to fill the air of the house. None\r\nof these advantages, however, will compensate the expense of the\r\napparatus; the first is hardly wanted where houses are placed in a\r\nconnected range, as the two outside ends of the houses are kept warm by\r\nthe flues entering there; and in the other houses a warm end is placed\r\nagainst a cold one.\r\n\r\n_Soil._ At first, Mr. Oldacre used good sound loam and dung, with a\r\nlittle sand, when he found it necessary; but he has for the last four\r\nyears grown his fruiting plants chiefly in powdered bones, in which he\r\nthinks they thrive better, and produce more highly-flavoured fruit. We\r\nhave not, however, been able to discover any thing in the appearance of\r\neither fruit or plants, to lead us to suppose that powdered bones are\r\nmore congenial to the Pine plant than good loam and dung; his plants are\r\ncertainly not equal to Mr. Baldwin’s, nor superior to those grown by Mr.\r\nAndrews, or Mr. Aiton. We, therefore, consider their thriving in this\r\ncompost a proof more of the hardy nature of the Pine, than of any thing\r\nelse; we have no doubt it would grow in powdered granite, or coal, or\r\nalmost any powder, not even excepting gunpowder, if a due proportion of\r\nwell-rotted manure were added, and water, heat, light, and air, duly\r\nsupplied.\r\n\r\n_General management._ In this, Mr. Oldacre has nothing particular; he is\r\ncareful not to let the temperature of either frames or pits, containing\r\nPine plants fall under 60° in winter, but is not afraid of a heat of 90°\r\nor 100° in summer. After shifting, and occasionally during very hot\r\nweather, he shades the plants in the frames and succession-pits, well\r\nknowing that the want of abundant and extended roots must lessen that\r\nsupply of moisture essential to the vigour of plants, during high\r\nsunshine, when evaporation is so powerful. His fruiting-plants he keeps\r\nin large pots, rather broad than deep, and so liberally supplies them\r\nwith water, that evaporation and transpiration go on even in the hottest\r\nsun-shine, without injuring the plants. He waters often with liquid\r\nmanure, generally the drainings of dunghills; frequently steams the\r\nhouse by watering the paths and flues when the steam apparatus is not at\r\nwork; sometimes he waters the plants over the top; and at all times he\r\nkeeps up a good bottom heat.\r\n\r\nIt may be further noticed, that in the hottest weather, from June to\r\nSeptember, he permits the temperature of the atmosphere of the house to\r\nrise to upwards of 100 degrees during the day, but leaves sufficient\r\nnumber of sashes open during the night, to lower the heat of the air\r\nwithin very nearly to that of the air without. This is perfectly natural\r\ntreatment, consistent with what takes place in those countries where the\r\nPine Apple is grown in the open air, and consonant with the practice of\r\nMr. Knight.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ These he keeps off by regimen, watering with clear water, and\r\nfilling the house with steam. In short, Mr. Oldacre’s opinions and\r\npractices, as far as circumstances have required practice, are in\r\nperfect unison with Mr. M’Phail’s: and it is not, perhaps, too much to\r\nassert, that experience will bring every gardener to the same result.\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ Mr. Oldacre considers that the fruit he produces in\r\nthe copper-roofed house is never so high-flavoured as that grown in the\r\nother with a timber roof, though the treatment be in all other respects\r\nthe same. This certainly appears a very singular circumstance, and not\r\nto be accounted for in the present state of human knowledge. The bars of\r\niron, or copper sashes, might possibly (but not probably) make some\r\ndifference in the electrical state of the air of the house, but this is\r\nthe utmost degree of variation we can conceive a metallic roof capable\r\nof making. If it admits more light, or abstracts more heat, these are\r\neffects easily counteracted, if desired, and must have been so, if they\r\nexisted in any degree, as Mr. Oldacre asserts the culture in both houses\r\nwas exactly alike.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, we must suspend our opinion on this subject; or rather\r\nconclude that it is more probable, Mr. Oldacre is mistaken in thinking\r\nthe culture he gives to the plants in both houses the same, than that\r\nthe single circumstance of a metallic roof on one of them, should make\r\nsuch difference in its produce. This report, which had been made current\r\nat the Horticultural Society, excited the attention of Sir Thomas\r\nBaring, who, having an extensive range of metallic hot-houses, at East\r\nStratton Park, his seat in Hampshire, soon afterwards sent a very fine\r\nPine Apple to the Society, to be tasted at one of their meetings. At\r\nthis meeting we were present, but though we tasted of this Pine Apple,\r\nyet not having sufficient opportunity of comparing it with any other, we\r\ncould not discern any difference. When a great many fruits are tasted in\r\nrapid succession, and of each such small portions as hardly to afford\r\nits real taste, the impression on the palate is evanescent; or at any\r\nrate, it is not, perhaps, too much to say, that under such\r\ncircumstances, it is difficult to form a solid judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. XV.\r\n\r\n  _Culture of the Pine Apple, by William Townsend Aiton, Esq.,\r\n  gardener to the King, at Kew and Kensington._\r\n\r\nIt is only within the last four years, that the Pine culture, in the\r\nroyal gardens, has been above mediocrity; before 1817, and as far back\r\nas we have had an opportunity of observing, they were in a very poor\r\nstate, those at Kew more particularly. At present, the Pines in both the\r\ngardens mentioned, are equal to any within ten miles of London; and,\r\nwith the exception of the New Providence, Black Antigua, and some other\r\nsorts, are not surpassed, even by those of Mr. Baldwin. The culture\r\npursued in the royal gardens, is as simple as it is successful; and as\r\neconomical as if the fruit were grown for the market by a commercial\r\ngardener. The whole does the highest credit to Mr. Aiton, and those whom\r\nhe employs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 14]\r\n\r\n_Form of House._ The plants are struck, and brought forward in pits, or\r\nframes, (fig. 14.) constructed exactly in Mr. Baldwin’s manner, with\r\nthis difference, that the sub-soil at Kensington being moist, they are\r\nraised on a small platform (_a_..._b_) above the surface, instead of\r\nbeing sunk under it, as Baldwin’s are. They have, also, the addition of\r\na gutter in front (_c_), which, though at first sight it may appear\r\ntrifling, yet, in practice, is of very material consequence, by keeping\r\nthe lining dry, and not chilling and interrupting the heat in the very\r\npart where it should penetrate to the interior of the pit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15]\r\n\r\nOccasionally some plants are fruited in these pits, especially at Kew,\r\nbut, in general, they are removed to a low house (fig. 15.) of a most\r\neconomical and judicious construction, and calculated both for the\r\ngrowth of Pines and Vines. This house is fifteen feet wide within walls;\r\nthe pit (_a_), is nine feet wide; the back path (_b_), forms a border\r\nfor the roots of the Vines; the pit is surrounded by a flue (_c_, _d_);\r\nthe curb, or plate is two feet three inches from the glass in front\r\n(_e_), and four feet eight inches from it behind (_f_); the Vines are\r\nplanted in the back border (_b_), and trained under the roof directly\r\nover it and over the back flue; and others are planted in the front\r\nborder (_g_); and trained up the rafters.\r\n\r\nThe length of the houses in the royal gardens at Kensington, varies from\r\nthirty-three to fifty feet (fig. 16.): each house has two furnaces, one\r\nfor constant use, and another for giving an extra supply of heat in\r\nvery severe weather. The first (_a_), proceeds directly to the front\r\ncorner (_b_), thence along the front to the opposite end (_c_), then\r\nalong the back of the pit (_d_, _e_), passing under the back path, or\r\nborder, and terminating in a chimney (_f_) beside the furnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16]\r\n\r\nThe other furnace is placed at the opposite end of the house (_g_); has\r\na short flue under the back path, which conducts it to the back course\r\nof the principal flue (at _d_), which it joins, and the smoke of the two\r\nfires moves in the same tunnel, (from _d_ to _e_) and passes out by the\r\nsame chimney. When this second furnace is not in use, its connection\r\nwith the flue of the first is cut off by a damper at the point of\r\njunction (_d_). A very small fire made in this furnace in severe\r\nweather, not only adds to the heat of the house by its own power, but by\r\nincreasing the draught, or rate of burning, of the fire in the other\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 17]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the fire heat, a steam apparatus has been lately erected,\r\nand the tubes conducted round the houses on the tops of the flues (fig.\r\n15. _d_, _e_); this is found to give a great command of heat, and also\r\nto admit of filling the house with vapour at pleasure. The height of the\r\nhouse from the ground to the top of the back wall, is only nine feet\r\n(fig. 17.); the rafters of the roof are placed about four feet apart,\r\ncentre from centre; or about twenty-four sashes are given to every\r\nhundred feet; the front sashes (_a_), are only eighteen inches high, and\r\nslide past each other; the middle end sash (_b_), also slides; the sill\r\nof the door (_c_), and the back path, or border, are on a level with the\r\nouter surface of the ground, to admit the easy wheeling in of tan, &c.;\r\nthe front border (_d_), is raised considerably above it, on account of\r\nthe wet bottom; the back sheds are low and neat, and the furnaces sunk\r\nthree feet below the surface (fig. 16, _h_ _h_) to give them a better\r\ndraught; and this also serves to drain the back border.\r\n\r\nThe houses are placed in pairs, the furnaces for general use at the\r\nextreme ends of the range, and the auxiliary ones in the middle, where\r\nthe steam-boiler is also placed, but worked by a fire apart.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, no plan of Pine-stove that has yet appeared, is more\r\nsimple, neat, economical, and complete than this; the only fault we have\r\nto them, is, that owing to the great thickness of wood employed on the\r\nbars of the sashes, they are rather dark and gloomy within; but this\r\nmight easily be remedied by the substitution of light iron rafters, with\r\nwooden framed sashes sliding in them, but the bars of the sashes formed\r\nof iron. It is true, gloomy as these houses are, the Pines thrive in\r\nthem as well as can be wished, but probably by having more light, they\r\nmight thrive, so as to surpass all expectation.\r\n\r\n_Soil._ Good yellow loam, with a third of rotten dung, and some road\r\ngrit to serve as sand. This is well mixed together, and passed through a\r\nwide screen, and the pots are well drained with three or four pieces of\r\npotsherd.\r\n\r\n_General management._ This differs in little or nothing from that of Mr.\r\nAndrews; and only from that of Mr. Baldwin in the crowns and suckers\r\nbeing struck in pots, instead of the bark, as is Mr. Baldwin’s practice.\r\nSupposing the crowns and suckers potted in September, they are not\r\ndisturbed till the following March; such as are very forward, are\r\nshifted at once into large pots, and will show fruit in the course of\r\nthat autumn, or within the year, and ripen their fruit in November or\r\nDecember, very desirable periods for the royal table, equally\r\nexpeditious, as in Mr. Baldwin’s mode, and more so than in Cuba or\r\nJamaica. The plants which are in a less forward state are disrooted\r\nentirely, put into pots according to their sizes, nursed all the summer\r\nin the pits, and moved to the larger houses in autumn, where they show\r\nfruit at various periods, during the winter, and in the following\r\nseason; thus ripening their fruit at different periods, from eighteen\r\nmonths to two and a half years, from the time they were taken from the\r\nparent plants. The pots in which these plants are fruited, seldom exceed\r\ntwelve inches in diameter.\r\n\r\n_Insects._ Various modes of getting rid of these was attempted both at\r\nKew and Kensington; that which was finally successful was steeping for\r\ntwo or three hours in strong tobacco-water, as recommended by Miller;\r\nthen washing in pure water two or three times--drying, planting,\r\nshading, and applying a brisk bottom heat, a moist atmosphere, and\r\ngiving a little air. This recovered the plants, and future regimen\r\ncontinued them in the vigorous state of health in which they now are.\r\n\r\n_Fruit produced._ The object, and it is most successfully attained, is\r\nto have handsome Pines on the royal table every day in the year; they\r\ncannot, of course, be very high-flavoured in the winter and spring\r\nmonths; but appearance, in some cases, is every thing--they look well,\r\nthe golden hue of the Apple, mimic grandeur of the crown, and the\r\npresence of such a rare fruit at an uncommon season, accords well with\r\nthe pomp and splendour of a royal table. As to flavor, indeed, by the\r\ntime the desert appears on great occasions, the palate is generally\r\nseasoned with wine, and a few drops of alcohol are already transferred\r\nto the ventricles of the brain; when that is the case, every fruit has\r\njust what flavor it ought to have; for the fine phrensy of a warmed\r\nimagination knows no degree of merit but the superlative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nIMPROVEMENTS RECENTLY ATTEMPTED IN THE CULTURE OF THE PINE APPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pine Apple has never been so generally cultivated in this country as\r\nit might have been, from an idea that its culture is attended with more\r\ndifficulty and expense than that of all other fruits; and, also, from\r\nthe circumstance of the greater number of gardeners being ignorant of\r\nits cultivation. With respect to the difficulty of cultivating this\r\nfruit, every gardener, who knows any thing about it, knows it is much\r\neasier grown and fruited than the cucumber early in spring, or the melon\r\nat any period of the year. In short, with the single difference of\r\nrequiring an artificial temperature, it is as easy, or easier to grow\r\nthan a common cabbage:--it is not nearly so liable to insects as that\r\nplant is in dry seasons; and of two plantations, the one of crowns or\r\nsuckers of Pines, and the other of seedling cabbages, we may venture to\r\nassert, that more of the former will perfect their fruit than those of\r\nthe latter will perfect their loaf or head.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the expense of cultivating the Pine Apple, it must be\r\nacknowledged that it is greater than that required to cultivate any\r\nother fruit; from the length of time requisite to bring it to\r\nperfection; the keeping up a high temperature during the winter months,\r\nand the unremitting attention required throughout the year. Another\r\nsource of expense, and in some cases of difficulty, has been the\r\nprocuring of tan, or other materials, to supply a bottom heat; and the\r\nlast one that may be mentioned is, that gardeners who undertake to\r\ncultivate the Pine Apple, generally are paid a higher remuneration than\r\nthose who confine themselves to the other fruits.\r\n\r\nThese circumstances have lately induced some amateurs, and also some\r\npractical gardeners, to devise means of simplifying the culture of the\r\nPine Apple, and lessening the expenses attending it. The principal\r\namateurs are T. A. Knight, Esq. the President of the Horticultural\r\nSociety, and Peter Marsland, Esq. of Woodbank, near Stockport; the\r\nprincipal practical gardeners are Mr. Gunter, of Earlscourt, Mr. Hay, a\r\nHorticultural architect in Edinburgh, and some others, who have made\r\nless extensive trials.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. I.\r\n\r\n  _Of the improvements in the culture of the Pine Apple, proposed by\r\n  T. A. Knight, Esq. F.R.S. P.H.S., of Downton-Castle, Herefordshire._\r\n\r\nMr. Knight’s improvements consist chiefly in the disuse of bottom heat,\r\nand in the application of a much higher temperature during sunshine at\r\nall seasons, but especially in the summer season, and a much lower\r\ntemperature during winter, and during the night, at all times, than is\r\ngenerally adopted by gardeners.\r\n\r\nMr. Knight had no experience in the culture of the Pine Apple till the\r\nyear 1819. In that year, he informs us (in a paper published in the\r\nthird volume of the Horticultural Transactions) that he tried the effect\r\nof a very high temperature during the day, in bright weather, and of\r\ncomparatively low temperature during the night, and in cloudy weather. A\r\nfire of sufficient power only to preserve the house in a temperature of\r\nabout 70° during summer, was employed; but no air was given, nor its\r\nescape facilitated, till the thermometer, perfectly shaded, indicated a\r\ntemperature of 95°, and then only two of the upper lights, one at each\r\nend, were let down about four inches. The heat of the house was,\r\nconsequently, sometimes raised to 110°, during the middle of bright\r\ndays, and it generally varied in such days from 90° to 105°, declining\r\nduring the evening to about 80°, and to 70° in the night. Late in the\r\nevening of every bright and hot day, the plants were copiously sprinkled\r\nwith water, nearly of the temperature of the external air. The melon,\r\nwater-melon, Guernsey lily, fig-tree, nectarine, orange and lemon,\r\nmango, Avocado-pear, Mammee-tree, and several other plants, part of them\r\nnatives of temperate climates, grew in this hot-house so managed\r\n“through the whole summer, without any one of them being etiolated, or\r\nany way injured, by the very high temperature to which they were\r\noccasionally subjected; and from these and other facts,” Mr. Knight\r\ncontinues, “which have come within my observation, I think myself\r\njustified in inferring, that in almost all cases in which the object of\r\nthe cultivator is to promote the rapid and vigorous growth of his\r\nplants, very high temperature, provided it be accompanied by bright\r\nsunshine, may be employed with great advantage; but it is necessary that\r\nthe glass of his house should be of good quality, and that his plants be\r\nplaced near it, and be abundantly supplied with sand and water.” In the\r\nabove case liquid-manure was employed.\r\n\r\nIt is added, “My house contains a few Pine Apple plants, in the\r\ntreatment of which I have deviated somewhat widely from the common\r\npractice; and I think with the best effects, for their growth has been\r\nexceedingly rapid, and a great many gardeners, who have come to see\r\nthem, have unanimously pronounced them more perfect than any which they\r\nhad previously seen. But many of the gardeners think that my mode of\r\nmanagement will not succeed in winter, and that my plants will become\r\nunhealthy, if they do not perish in that season; and as some of them\r\nhave had much experience, and I very little, I wish, at present, to\r\ndecline saying more relative to the culture of that plant.” _Hort.\r\nTrans._ iii. 465.\r\n\r\nThe above information, the result of Mr. Knight’s experiments in 1819,\r\nwas communicated to the Horticultural Society in the autumn of that\r\nyear. On the 7th of March following, a paper was read to the Society on\r\nthe same plants, of which the following is a transcript:\r\n\r\nOf those gardeners who doubted whether the plants would stand the\r\nwinter, it is stated, “The same gardeners have since frequently visited\r\nmy hot-house, and they have unanimously pronounced my plants more\r\nhealthy and vigorous than any they had previously seen: and they are\r\nall, I have good reason to believe, zealous converts to my mode of\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n“I had long been much dissatisfied with the manner in which the Pine\r\nApple plant is usually treated, and very much disposed to believe the\r\nbark-bed, as Mr. Kent has stated, (_Hort. Trans._ iii. 288.) ‘worse than\r\nuseless,’ subsequent to the emission of roots by the crowns or suckers.\r\nI therefore resolved to make a few experiments upon the culture of that\r\nplant; but as I had not at that period, (the beginning of October,) any\r\nhot-house, I deferred obtaining plants till the following spring. My\r\nhot-house was not completed till the second week in June (1819,) at\r\nwhich period I began my experiment upon _nine_ plants, which had been\r\nbut very ill preserved through the preceding winter by the gardener of\r\none of my friends, with very inadequate means, and in a very\r\ninhospitable climate. These, at this period, were not larger plants than\r\nsome which I have subsequently raised from small crowns, (three having\r\nbeen afforded by one fruit,) planted in the middle of August, were in\r\nthe end of December last; but they are now beginning to blossom, and in\r\nthe opinion of every gardener who has seen them, promise fruit of great\r\nsize and perfection. They are all of the variety known by the name of\r\nRipley’s Queen Pine.\r\n\r\n“Upon the introduction of my plants into the hot-house, the mode of\r\nmanagement, which it is the object of the present communication to\r\ndescribe, commenced. They were put into pots of somewhat more than a\r\nfoot in diameter, in a compost made of thin, green turf, recently taken\r\nfrom a river-side, chopped very small, and pressed closely, whilst wet,\r\ninto the pots; a circular piece of the same material, of about an inch\r\nin thickness, having been inverted, unbroken, to occupy the bottom of\r\neach pot. This substance, so applied, I have always found to afford the\r\nmost efficient means for draining off superfluous water, and\r\nsubsequently of facilitating the removal of a plant from one pot to\r\nanother, without loss of roots. The surface of the reduced turf was\r\ncovered with a layer of vegetable mould obtained from decayed leaves,\r\nand of sandy-loam, to prevent the growth of the grass-roots. The pots\r\nwere then placed to stand upon brick-piers, near the glass; and the\r\npiers being formed of loose bricks (without mortar), were capable of\r\nbeing reduced as the height of the plants increased. The temperature of\r\nthe house was generally raised in hot and bright days, chiefly by\r\nconfined solar heat, from 95° to 105°, and sometimes to 110°, no air\r\nbeing ever given till the temperature of the house exceeded 95°; and the\r\nescape of heated air was then, only in a slight degree permitted. In the\r\nnight, the temperature of the house generally sunk to 70°, or somewhat\r\nlower. At this period, and through the months of July and August, a\r\nsufficient quantity of pigeons’ dung was steeped in the water, which was\r\ngiven to the Pine plants, to raise its colour nearly to that of porter,\r\nand with this they were usually supplied twice a day in very hot\r\nweather; the mould in the pots being kept constantly very damp, or what\r\ngardeners would generally call wet. In the evenings, after very hot\r\ndays, the plants were often sprinkled with clear water, of the\r\ntemperature of the external air; but this was never repeated till all\r\nthe remains of the last sprinkling had disappeared from the axillæ of\r\nthe leaves.\r\n\r\n“It is, I believe, almost a general custom with gardeners, to give their\r\nPine plants larger pots in autumn, and this mode of practice is\r\napproved by Mr. Baldwin. (_Cult. of Anan._ 16.) I nevertheless cannot\r\navoid thinking it wrong; for the plants, at this period, and\r\nsubsequently, owing to want of light, can generate a small quantity only\r\nof new sap; and consequently, the matter which composes the new roots\r\nthat the plant will be excited to emit into the fresh mould, must be\r\ndrawn chiefly from the same reservoir, which is to supply the blossom\r\nand fruit: and I have found, that transplanting fruit-trees, in autumn,\r\ninto larger pots, has rendered their next year’s produce of fruit\r\nsmaller in size, and later in maturity. I therefore would not remove my\r\nPine plants into larger pots, although those in which they grow are\r\nconsiderably too small.\r\n\r\n“As the length of the days diminished, and the plants received less\r\nlight, their ability to digest food diminished. Less food was in\r\nconsequence dissolved in the water, which was also given with a more\r\nsparing hand; and as winter approached, water only was given, and in\r\nsmall quantities.\r\n\r\n“During the months of November and December, the temperature of the\r\nhouse was generally little above 50°, and sometimes as low as 48°, and\r\nonce so low as 40°. Most gardeners would, I believe, have been alarmed\r\nfor the safety of their plants at this temperature; but the Pine is a\r\nmuch hardier plant than it is usually supposed to be; and I exposed one\r\nyoung plant in December to a temperature of 32°, by which it did not\r\nappear to sustain any injury. I have also been subsequently informed by\r\none of my friends, Sir Harford Jones, who has had most ample\r\nopportunities of observing, that he has frequently seen, in the east,\r\nthe Pine Apple growing in the open air, where the surface of the ground,\r\nearly in the mornings, showed unequivocal marks of a slight degree of\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\n“My plants remained nearly torpid, and without growth, during the latter\r\npart of November, and in the whole of December; but they began to grow\r\nearly in January, although the temperature of the house rarely reached\r\n60°; and about the 20th of that month, the blossom, or rather the future\r\nfruit, of the earliest plant, became visible; and subsequently to that\r\nperiod their growth has appeared very extraordinary to gardeners who had\r\nnever seen Pine plants growing, except in a bark-bed or other hot-bed. I\r\nbelieve this rapidity of growth, in rather low temperature, may be\r\ntraced to the more exciteable state of their roots, owing to their\r\nhaving passed the winter in a very low temperature comparatively with\r\nthat of a bark-bed. The plants are now supplied with water in moderate\r\nquantities, and holding in solution a less quantity of food than was\r\ngiven them in summer.\r\n\r\n“In planting suckers, I have, in several instances, left the stems and\r\nroots of the old plant remaining attached to them; and these have made a\r\nmuch more rapid progress than others. One strong sucker was thus planted\r\nin a large pot upon the 20th of July, (1819;) and that is (March 1820)\r\nbeginning to show fruit. Its stem is thick enough to produce a very\r\nlarge fruit; but its leaves are short, though broad and numerous; and\r\nthe gardeners who have seen it, all appear wholly at a loss to\r\nconjecture what will be the value of its produce. In other cases, in\r\nwhich I retained the old stems and roots, I selected small and late\r\nsuckers, and these have afforded me the most perfect plants I have ever\r\nseen; and they do not exhibit any symptoms of disposition to fruit\r\nprematurely. I am, however, still ignorant whether any advantage will be\r\nultimately obtained by this mode of treating the Queen Pine; but I\r\nbelieve it will be found applicable with much advantage in the culture\r\nof those varieties of the Pine, which do not usually bear fruit till the\r\nplants are three or four years old.\r\n\r\n“I shall now offer a few remarks upon the facility of managing Pines in\r\nthe manner recommended, and upon the necessary amount of the expense. My\r\ngardener is an extremely simple labourer, he does not know a letter or a\r\nfigure; and he never saw a Pine plant growing, till he saw those of\r\nwhich he has the care. If I were absent, he would not know at what\r\nperiod of maturity to cut the fruit; but in every other respect he knows\r\nhow to manage the plants as well as I do; and I could teach any other\r\nmoderately intelligent and attentive labourer, in one month, to manage\r\nthem just as well as he can: in short, I do not think the skill\r\nnecessary to raise a Pine Apple, according to the mode of culture I\r\nrecommend, is as great as that requisite to raise a forced crop of\r\npotatoes. The expense of fuel for my hot-house, which is forty feet\r\nlong, by twelve wide, is rather less than sevenpence a-day here, where I\r\nam twelve miles distant from coal-pits: and if I possessed the\r\nadvantages of a curved iron-roof, such as those erected by Mr. Loudon,\r\nat Bayswater, which would prevent the too rapid escape of heated-air in\r\ncold weather, I entertain no doubt, that the expense of heating a house\r\nforty-five feet long, and ten wide, and capable of holding eighty\r\nfruiting Pine plants, exclusive of grapes or other fruits upon the back\r\nwall, would not exceed fourpence a day. A roof of properly curved iron\r\nbars, appears to me also to present many other advantages: it may be\r\nerected at much less cost, it is much more durable, it requires much\r\nless expense to paint it, and it admits greatly more light.” _Hort.\r\nTrans._ iv. 72.\r\n\r\nMr. Knight adds, “I have not yet been troubled with insects upon my Pine\r\nplants (having only had nine plants for about as many months), and have\r\nnot, of course, tried any of the published receipts for destroying them.\r\nMr. Baldwin recommends the steam of hot fermenting horse-dung: I\r\nconclude the destructive agent, in this case, is ammoniacal gas; which\r\nSir Humphry Davy informed me he had found to be instantly fatal to every\r\nspecies of insect; and if so, this might be obtained at a small expense,\r\nby pouring a solution of crude muriate of ammonia upon quick-lime; the\r\nstable, or cow-house, would afford an equally efficient, though less\r\ndelicate, fluid. The ammoniacal gas might, I conceive, be impelled, by\r\nmeans of a pair of bellows, amongst the leaves of the infected plants,\r\nin sufficient quantity to destroy animal, without injuring vegetable\r\nlife: and it is a very interesting question to the gardener, whether his\r\nhardy enemy, the red spider, will bear it with impunity.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1820, in June, Mr. Knight had such a house as he has hinted\r\nat, erected. Its general appearance (fig. 18.), is simple, and the roof\r\nadmits as much light, as any roof that can be constructed in the present\r\nstate of knowledge, in the combination of wrought iron and common glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 19]\r\n\r\nThe plan of this house, or pit (fig. 19.), is fifty feet in length, and\r\nten feet wide; the furnace (_a_) is placed at one end; the flue\r\nproceeds from it directly to the front parapet (_b_), and passing along\r\nclose under it to the opposite end, there terminates in a chimney (_c_).\r\nInstead of a pit, a curious stage is constructed, by forming cross walls\r\n(_d_), or rather piers, connected by arches, and finished by a gradation\r\nof flat surfaces, or steps, on which the pots are placed, so as to stand\r\nas near the glass as possible (fig. 20.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 20]\r\n\r\nAir is admitted by shutters, which open outwards, immediately under the\r\nstone plinth of the parapet (fig. 20. _a_), in which the lower ends of\r\nthe iron bars are fixed; and allowed to escape by similar shutters,\r\nopening outwards, immediately under the stone coping of the back wall\r\n(_b_), in which the upper ends of the same bars are leaded in. The path\r\nbehind is on a level with the exterior surface; the width of the cross\r\nwalls the length of a brick, or nine inches, and they are finished with\r\nfoot tyles; the width between them is about fifteen inches, by which\r\nmeans, any ordinary sized person may pass from the back path to the\r\nfront flue, and water or examine the plants on each side.\r\n\r\nThis house being finished, was immediately stocked with Pines, some\r\nfigs, and various other plants, all of which, Mr. Knight stated\r\nverbally, in May 1821, to various members of the Horticultural Society,\r\nsucceeded admirably; but by neglect of the gardener, or rather labourer,\r\nwho attended them, they were killed by an over-heat in Mr. Knight’s\r\nabsence from home.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] The poor man had probably overheated himself, and comparing by\r\n  his feelings the temperature of the Pinery with his own, found the\r\n  latter much in its usual state; not knowing “a letter or a figure,”\r\n  of course, he could not take a hint from the thermometer.\r\n\r\nThe house was again stocked with plants, which Mr. Knight, in a paper\r\nread to the Horticultural Society, in November last (1821), stated to be\r\nin a most thriving condition; and a friend of ours who had made an\r\nextensive gardening tour in the North and West of England, and who saw\r\nthe Pine plants at Downton Castle, also in November, declares they\r\nappeared the most magnificent he had seen on his journey; “the plants,”\r\nhe says, “were stocky, and the leaves long, broad, and green; the\r\nlargest were in pots fourteen inches in diameter, and their leaves\r\nreached to the glass.”\r\n\r\nIn the paper alluded to, Mr. Knight goes on to say, “I possess more than\r\nsufficient evidence to enable me to assert with confidence, that, in the\r\nculture of the Pine Apple, the bark bed, or other hot-bed, if the plants\r\nbe plunged into it, is worse than useless, after the scions, or crowns,\r\nhave emitted roots; and that the Pine Apple, when treated in the manner\r\nI have recommended, is a fruit of most extremely easy culture.\r\n\r\n“It is contended, in favour of the bark-bed, that the soil in\r\ninter-tropical climates is warm, and that the bark-bed does no more than\r\nnature does in the native climate of the Pine Apple. And if the bark-bed\r\ncould be made to give a steady temperature of about ten degrees below\r\nthat of the day temperature of the air in the stove, I readily admit\r\nthat Pine plants would thrive better in a compost of that temperature,\r\nthan in a colder. But the temperature of the bark-bed is constantly\r\nsubject to excess, and defect, and I contend, and can prove, that the\r\nabove-mentioned temperature is very nearly given in my stove. For the\r\ntemperature of the day being about 90° or 95°, and that of the night\r\n70°, the mould in the pots will necessarily acquire nearly the\r\nintermediate temperature of 80°. It is true, that two disturbing causes\r\nare in action; the evaporation from the mould, and porous surface of the\r\npots, and the radiant heat of the sun. But these causes operate in\r\nopposition to each other, and probably nearly negative the operation of\r\neach other, as far as respects the temperature of the mould in the pots.\r\n\r\n“A very great number of gardeners have within the last twelve months\r\nvisited my garden. Some of these were at once convinced of the\r\nadvantages of the mode of culture which they saw; others have paid a\r\nsecond, or third visit; but every one has ultimately declared himself a\r\nzealous convert. I have never yet seen plants of the same age equally\r\nstrong, nor any producing fruit better, nor indeed so well swelled; nor\r\nany equal in richness and flavour. But I have never taken off, nor\r\nshortened a root, nor taken any other measures to retard the period of\r\nfructification, with the prospect of obtaining larger fruit; and my\r\nplants have almost always showed fruit when fourteen or fifteen months\r\nold, though propagated from small and young suckers, or crowns. A great\r\npart of my Queen Pines (I have hitherto scarcely ever cultivated any\r\nother varieties) have, however, at that age, shown fruit with eight, and\r\nsome with nine rows of pips; and I often see fruit of less weight\r\ngrowing upon plants of nearly double that age. Whether I shall be able\r\nto retard the period of fructification, or not, I have yet to learn; but\r\nI believe, I shall succeed by crowding my plants close together, so that\r\neach may receive less light.\r\n\r\n“Pine plants will, however, grow perfectly well in composts of different\r\nkinds; but I have found that they have succeeded best when the materials\r\nhave been fresh, and retaining their organic form, particularly if the\r\npots be large, relatively to the size of the plants, which, I think,\r\nthey always ought to be, for the mode of culture recommended. I have\r\nused, with advantage, the haulm of beans cut into lengths of about an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n“Very contrary to the conclusions which I should have been led to draw\r\nfrom writings upon the culture of the Pine Apple, I have constantly\r\nfound that my plants succeed best in the part of my house where the flue\r\nfirst enters, and where the temperature is very high, varying from about\r\n85° to 105°, and the air excessively dry. I have pointed out this\r\ncircumstance to every gardener, whom I have seen in my house, and all\r\nhave expressed their astonishment at the circumstance. I expected that\r\nthis excess of heat would have occasioned the plants to show fruit\r\nprematurely, but this has not occurred in a single instance. What would\r\nbe the quality of the fruit, if it were to be ripened in so high a\r\ntemperature, I have not yet had an opportunity of knowing.\r\n\r\n“In raising young plants, I have deviated from the ordinary mode of\r\npractice by breaking off the suckers when very young; that is, when they\r\nare not more than four or five inches long. The fruit is much benefited\r\nby their absence; and the cuttings, if placed very close together in a\r\nhot-bed, are made to emit roots with little trouble, and afford better\r\nplants than they do when they are suffered to remain long upon the\r\nparent stem. When the whole are removed at an early period, one or more\r\nvery strong suckers usually spring out below the level of the soil; and\r\nfrom these, suffering only one to remain attached to the parent stem,\r\nand preserving the roots as entire as possible, I have propagated with\r\nmuch advantage, and have obtained plants which showed fruit strongly at\r\nseven months, dating from the period at which the sucker appeared, like\r\na strong head of asparagus, at the surface of the soil.\r\n\r\n“The success of my experiments, in the first house which I erected, (and\r\nto which the foregoing account exclusively refers,) led me to erect\r\nanother house (figs. 18. 19. and 20.) in the summer of 1829. In this I\r\nattempted to obtain the greatest possible influence of light, and\r\ncommand of solar heat; inferring, from having observed Pine Apples to\r\nripen tolerably well with very little light, that I should be able to\r\nripen them in perfection late in the autumn, and early in the spring,\r\nparticularly at the latter period, in which, alone, I set a very high\r\nvalue upon the species of fruit. The height of the back wall (fig. 20.)\r\nof this house is eight feet six inches, and that of the front wall is\r\none foot six inches, and its breadth ten feet, inside measure, with an\r\niron curvilinear roof, (fig. 18.) of the kind of bar invented by Mr.\r\nLOUDON, of Bayswater. This house is fifty feet long, (fig. 19.) and\r\ncapable of containing two hundred fruiting Pine plants. The curvature of\r\nthe roof rises just one foot in twelve. The glass is laid in a\r\ncomposition of two parts white lead, with oil, and three of flint sand,\r\nand the overlaps of the glass are closely filled with the same material.\r\nIt is, consequently, very nearly air-tight; and no means are given for\r\nthe air to enter, or escape, except by apertures immediately under the\r\ncopings of the front and back wall, (_a_ and _b_, fig. 20.) which can\r\nbe efficiently closed at any time. It is, consequently, an instrument of\r\nvery great power, and requiring, of course, much attention to\r\nventilation: of which I had rather a lamentable proof in the last\r\nspring, when my plants were all burned, and spoiled in a few hours; the\r\nperson who had the care of them having left them in a bright day closely\r\nshut up. The fault was not, however, in any degree in the house, for the\r\nplants were, previously, much the strongest, and the best I ever saw;\r\nand I believe, they would have afforded most beautiful fruit. I\r\nfurnished the house again with plants as expeditiously as I could,\r\nchiefly in July; and I have since kept the temperature of it nearly\r\nbetween 70° and 95°, with a wish to make the plants show fruit and\r\nblossom in the present month (October.) In this, I have in part\r\nsucceeded, though many of my plants have flowered a fortnight or three\r\nweeks sooner than I wished. The fruit is swelling well, and, I believe,\r\nwill receive sufficient light through the winter to enable it to ripen\r\nin much perfection. The excellence of a few Pine Apples, which ripened\r\nin this house in the last winter, leads me almost to doubt, whether the\r\nfruit in it will not ripen better, early in the spring, than in the\r\nmiddle of the summer, for I have observed that this species of plant,\r\nthough extremely patient of high temperature, is not, by any means, so\r\npatient of the action of very continued bright light, as many other\r\nplants: and much less so than the Fig and Orange tree: possibly, having\r\nbeen formed by nature for inter-tropical climates, its powers of life\r\nmay become fatigued, and exhausted by the length of a bright English\r\nsummer’s day in high temperature. Being a plant of low stature, nature\r\nhas also probably given it the power to ripen its fruit and seed, in the\r\nshade of other plants, in its native climate; and I discovered in the\r\nlast summer, that it possesses the power to ripen its fruit perfectly in\r\na lower temperature than I previously thought it capable of growing in.\r\n\r\n“In the month of June, I gave a couple of Pine plants, which had shown\r\nfruit at six months old, and were of small size, and no value, to a\r\nchild of one of my friends, to be placed in a conservatory, in which no\r\nfires were kept during the summer. In July, a storm of hail destroyed\r\nnearly, or fully, half the glass of the conservatory; and its\r\ntemperature, through the summer and autumn, had been so low, that the\r\nChasselas grapes in it were not ripe in the second week in September. In\r\nthe second week of the present month (October) one of the Pine Apples\r\nbecame ripe, having previously swollen to a most extraordinary size,\r\ncomparatively with the size of the plant; and upon measuring accurately\r\nthe comparative width of the fruit, and of the stem, I found the width\r\nof the fruit to exceed that of the stem in the proportion of seven and\r\nthree-quarters to one. The fruit had, of course, been propped during all\r\nthe latter part of the summer, the stem being wholly incapable of\r\nsupporting it. The taste and flavour of this fruit were excellent, and\r\nthe appearance of the other, which is not yet ripe, and is of a larger\r\nsize, is still more promising. I purpose to profit by this result in the\r\nnext summer; and I hope to be able to communicate some further\r\ninformation to the Society in the autumn. I feel perfectly confident,\r\nthat if the roots of these plants had grown in a hot-bed of any kind,\r\ntheir sap would have been impelled into other channels; and that their\r\nfruit would not have attained, in any degree, the state of perfection\r\nwhich I have described.”\r\n\r\nThis is the latest printed account of Mr. Knight’s experiments on the\r\nPine Apple. It would be premature to draw any general conclusions in so\r\nearly a stage of their progress, and might excite prejudice to\r\nanticipate the final result. That the Pine plant will grow and thrive\r\nwithout what is technically called bottom heat, is an obvious truth,\r\nsince no plant in a state of nature is found growing in soil warmer than\r\nthat of the superincumbent atmosphere. But to imitate nature, is not\r\nalways the best mode of culture; for the more correct the imitation, the\r\nless valuable would be the greater part of her products, at least as far\r\nas horticulture is concerned. What would our celery, cabbage, and apples\r\nbe, if their culture were copied from nature? Though the Pine Apple will\r\ngrow well without bottom heat, it may grow with bottom heat still\r\nbetter; and though the heat of the earth, in its native country, may\r\nnever exceed that of the surrounding atmosphere, it does not follow that\r\nearth heated to a greater degree may not be of service to it, in a state\r\nof artificial culture. But admitting, for the sake of argument, that the\r\nPine plant could be grown equally well with, as without bottom heat;\r\nstill it appears to us that the mass of material which furnishes this\r\nheat, will always be a most desirable thing to have in a Pine stove, as\r\nbeing a perpetual fund of heat for supplying the atmosphere of the\r\nhouse, in case of accident to the flues or steam apparatus. Besides it\r\nappears from nature, as well as from observing what takes place in\r\nculture, that the want of a steady temperature and degree of moisture at\r\nthe roots of plants is more immediately and powerfully injurious to them\r\nthan atmospheric changes. Earth, especially if rendered porous and\r\nspungelike by culture, receives and gives out air and heat slowly; and\r\nwhile the temperature of the air of a country, or a hot-house, may vary\r\ntwenty or thirty degrees in the course of twenty-four hours, the soil at\r\nthe depth of two inches would hardly be found to have varied one degree.\r\nWith respect to moisture, every cultivator knows, that in a properly\r\nconstituted and regularly pulverized soil, whatever quantity of rain may\r\nfall on the surface, the soil is never saturated with water, nor, in\r\ntimes of great drought, burnt up with heat. The porous texture of the\r\nsoil and sub-soil being at once favourable for the escape of\r\nsuperfluous water, and adverse to its evaporation, by never becoming so\r\nmuch heated on the surface, or conducting the heat so far downwards as a\r\nclose compact soil.\r\n\r\nThese properties of the soil relatively to plants can never be\r\ncompletely attained by growing plants in pots, and least of all by\r\ngrowing them in pots surrounded by air. In this state, whatever may be\r\nthe care of the gardener, a continual succession of changes of\r\ntemperature will take place in the outside of the pot, and the compact\r\nmaterial of which it is composed being a much more rapid conductor of\r\nheat than porous earth, it will soon be communicated to the web of roots\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nWith respect to water, a plant in a pot surrounded by air is equally\r\nliable to injury. If the soil be properly constituted, and the pot\r\nproperly drained, the water passes through the mass as soon as poured on\r\nit, and the soil at that moment may be said to be left in a state\r\nfavourable for vegetation. But as the evaporation from the surface and\r\nsides of the pot, and the transpiration of the plant goes on, it becomes\r\ngradually less and less so, and if not soon re-supplied, would become\r\ndry and shrivelled, and either die from that cause, or be materially\r\ninjured by the sudden and copious application of water.\r\n\r\nThus, the roots of a plant in a pot surrounded by air, are liable to be\r\nalternately chilled and scorched by cold or heat, and deluged or dried\r\nup by superabundance or deficiency of water, and nothing but the\r\nperpetual care and attention of the gardener to lessen the tendencies to\r\nthese extremes could at all preserve the plant from destruction.\r\n\r\nTo lessen the attention of the gardener, therefore, to render the plant\r\nless dependent on his services, and, above all, to put a plant in a pot\r\nas far as possible on a footing with a plant in the unconfined soil,\r\nplunging the pot in a mass of earth, sand, dung, tan, or any such\r\nmaterial, appears to us a most judicious part of culture, and one that\r\nnever can be relinquished in fruit-bearing plants with impunity. Even if\r\nno heat were to be afforded by the mass in which the pots were plunged,\r\nstill the preservation of a steady temperature which would always equal\r\nthe average temperature of the air of the house, and the retention, by\r\nthe same means, of a steady degree of moisture, would, in our opinion,\r\nbe a sufficient argument for plunging pots of vigorous growing,\r\nmany-leaved, or fruit-bearing plants.\r\n\r\nSuch are the observations that we think may be made relatively to Mr.\r\nKnight’s plan, without prejudice to whatever new lights he may throw out\r\non the subject. Had it been brought forward by a less eminent\r\nhorticulturist, it would not have claimed so much attention, as the plan\r\nof growing Pines without bottom-heat is generally considered to have\r\nbeen tried first by M. Le Cour, and subsequently by various others, and\r\nabandoned. In Mr. Knight’s hands, however, whether it fail or succeed,\r\nit is certain of doing good, by the observations it will elicit from\r\nthe fertile and ingenious mind of so candid and philosophical a\r\nhorticulturist.\r\n\r\nSir William Edward Rous Boughton has erected a house or pit at Downton\r\nHall, similar to that of Mr. Knight, but rather wider.[2] Pines are\r\ngrown in it on Mr. Knight’s plan, but the plants were not in a thriving\r\nstate in November last. Charles Holford, Esq. of Hampstead, is also a\r\ndisciple of Mr. Knight as to the culture of this fruit, but he has not\r\nyet been very successful.\r\n\r\n  [2] The roofs, both of this house and that of Mr. Knight, were\r\n  furnished by Messrs. W. & D. Bailey, of Holborn, London.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\n  _Of other Improvements in the Culture of the Pine Apple, by\r\n  different persons._\r\n\r\nWe shall first notice the improvements which respect bottom-heat, and\r\nbegin with noticing an attempt made by Mr. Thomas Jenkins, of the\r\nPortman Nursery, London, to warm both the pots in which the plants are\r\ngrown, and the air of the house, by the heat generated by fermenting\r\nstable-dung placed in a vault beneath.\r\n\r\nIt is only within the last three years that Mr. Jenkins has begun to\r\ngrow the Pine Apple to any extent; he brings forward the plants in\r\nhot-beds and deep frames, inclosing beds of tan, and heated by linings\r\nof dung. As an economical part of the construction, we may mention that\r\nhe substitutes wattled hurdles for the lower part of the frame, in\r\ncontact with the tan, by which means a saving in the first cost is\r\neffected, and the heat of the dung penetrates much more readily to the\r\ntan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 21]\r\n\r\nMost of the plants are fruited in these pits, but some are fruited in a\r\nhouse, (_fig. 21._) which “though furnished with flues, yet these have\r\nbeen very little used. The heat imparted to the plants is produced by\r\nthe fermentation of stable-dung in a pit below the plants, the top of\r\nwhich is covered by tiles supported by iron rafters, with the joints\r\nclosely cemented, to prevent the passage of steam into the house. The\r\npots are neither bedded in tan, nor in mould, but stand on the tiles,\r\nand the interstices between them warm the air of the house.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 22]\r\n\r\nThe dung is managed as in West’s pit (_fig. 22._), but with the addition\r\nof being watered after it is thrown in, which is found to promote\r\nfermentation, and the intensity of the heat.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest instances of steam being used as a bottom-heat with\r\nwhich we are acquainted, was that by Mr. Butler, gardener to the Earl of\r\nDerby, at Knowlesly, near Liverpool, in or about 1792. It had been used\r\ntwenty years before, but chiefly for other purposes. Speechly, in 1796,\r\nknew only two instances in which steam was applied as bottom-heat; and,\r\nwith M’Phail, does not think it will finally answer as a substitute for\r\ntan. Instances in which it is adopted, are now much more numerous; but\r\ntime sufficient has not elapsed, and the opinions of gardeners are yet\r\ntoo unsettled on its merits to enable us to recommend it for adoption in\r\ngeneral practice. For heating the atmosphere of hot-houses, there seems\r\nlittle (or at least much less) doubt of its being preferable to\r\nfire-heat.\r\n\r\nCount Zubow, at St. Petersburg, employed steam to heat a pit or cistern\r\nof water, over which, at about three inches distance, a frame, covered\r\nwith faggots, was placed, and on this was laid the earth, in which his\r\nPines and other exotics were planted without being in pots. The plan is\r\nsaid to have succeeded, and a wholesome temperature to have been\r\nobtained and communicated to the mould above the faggots.\r\n\r\nMr. Gunter, as before observed, (Chap. IV. sect. 13.) had already tried\r\nthe use of steam as a bottom heat without success.\r\n\r\nMr. John Hay, horticultural architect, tried the use of steam so early\r\nas 1794, when gardener at Preston Hall, near Edinburgh, and he gives the\r\nfollowing account of his apparatus and success in the Memoirs of the\r\nCaledonian Horticultural Society. “The application of steam to\r\nforcing-houses early caught my attention. The first that I designed and\r\nexecuted in Scotland on this plan, were at Preston Hall in Mid-Lothian,\r\nin the year 1794. The fruiting Pine-stove, which is in the general suite\r\nof houses, with two peach-houses on the west, were originally adapted to\r\nsteam. I entertained the hope, that steam thrown into a chamber, in the\r\nbottom of the plant pit, would act as a proper substitute for bottom\r\nheat in place of tan, as none of that substance was to be found nearer\r\nthan four miles distant, and when wanted was often difficult to be\r\nprocured. Other more general considerations also made me desirous of\r\nprocuring some substitute, particularly the necessity of repeatedly\r\nshifting the plants to renew the heat, when the bark in the plant-pit\r\ngets cold: these shiftings, besides the trouble, often retard the growth\r\nof the plants. Again, if the heat of the fermentation of the tan rise\r\nmuch above ninety-six degrees, (which it often does), and if the pots be\r\nfully plunged in the tan at such a time, many instances have been known\r\nof the roots of the plants being burned, and some of them being\r\ndestroyed altogether. This, indeed, may be considered as one of the\r\nprincipal reasons why so many are unsuccessful in the culture of this\r\nfine fruit. With the view of obviating the above difficulties, the\r\nbottom of the fruiting Pine-pit was constructed with a chamber below,\r\ninto which steam was introduced by means of copper and lead pipes from a\r\nboiler placed in the shades behind: the top of the chamber was\r\nconstructed of rafters, on which were placed broad grey slates, laid on\r\nloose, without filling up the vacancies between them. The not making\r\nthem close, I afterwards found to be an error; for the moisture, from\r\nthe condensation of the steam, penetrating through the openings at the\r\njoining of the slates, communicated too much wetness to the bottom of\r\nthe pots; but I found, that there was a sufficient quantity of heat to\r\nbe obtained from the steam for heating the plant-pit, provided the\r\nbottom were close. I therefore discontinued this plan; and I had not an\r\nopportunity of making any farther experiment on the subject in this\r\nplace. From the same boiler, I conducted into the two peach-houses\r\nadjoining, a range of pipes furnished with steam-cocks. They passed the\r\nwhole length of the houses, (101 f. 6 in.). By means of these, the\r\npeach-houses were regularly steamed near one hour a-day in the evening,\r\nin the time of flowering and of fruit-setting. Steaming, it may be\r\nremarked, is very important at these times. In after periods, when I had\r\nnot an apparatus for the purpose, I always steamed the peach-house with\r\na large piece of cast-iron, made red hot in one of the furnaces, and put\r\ninto a white-iron pail nearly full of water; the whole water thus\r\nevaporating into steam. I was always successful, while in practice as a\r\ngardener, in raising a full crop of peaches; and think that much was\r\nowing to attention to steaming.\r\n\r\n“I afterwards erected Pine-stoves for John Hervey, Esq. of Castlesemple,\r\nto be heated by steam; and one of the plant-pits had a chamber below,\r\nwith a close bottom, into which chamber, steam was thrown by means of\r\ncast-iron pipes. About the same time, I was applied to by Sir Hew\r\nHamilton Dalrymple, Bart. (through Mr. James Dodds, his gardener), to\r\nexamine his Pine-stoves at Bargany, and to report whether I thought they\r\ncould be improved, as he hitherto had not been so successful in\r\nPine-Apples as he expected. One principal cause was, the difficulty of\r\nobtaining tan. Upon my report, it was to be determined, whether to give\r\nup the Pine-Apple culture altogether, or endeavour to improve the\r\nstoves.\r\n\r\n“Upon examining, I advised the heating of the atmosphere of the houses\r\nwith steam; and in place of using tan, the heating of the bottom of the\r\nplant-pit with steam also.” This advice was adopted, and eighteen months\r\nafter the plan was executed, the gardener, Mr. James Dodds, gives the\r\nfollow-account of his success.\r\n\r\n“It is now eighteen months since I first began to heat the Pine-stoves\r\nhere with steam. I have thus been enabled to give it a fair trial, and I\r\nam fully satisfied that it is superior to the old method of heating by\r\nfire-flues. I have found the plants to grow more luxuriantly, and\r\nperfectly clean of any kind of _insects_. The moist heat arising from\r\nsteam is well known to be hostile to all kinds of vermin. It is,\r\nbesides, more economical: our Pine-stoves here are seventy feet long, it\r\nformerly took two fires to keep up the heat of the atmospheric air of\r\nthe house, whereas in the new method of heating by steam, one fire to\r\nheat the boiler is sufficient, except in very cold nights, when I have\r\nfound it necessary to light a very small fire to the flue, to meet the\r\ndecline of the steam in the morning, and this only to the fruiting-house\r\nin the spring months, when the Pines begin to show their fruit. In\r\nshort, I have found no difficulty in keeping up the heat of the house to\r\nsixty degrees, by making up the fire to the boiler at ten o’clock at\r\nnight, and at six o’clock in the morning.\r\n\r\n“With regard to the bottom heat for the Pine-plants, by steam from the\r\nsame boiler, I find, by allowing the steam to remain in the chamber\r\nbelow the plants about two hours a day, the pit is kept constantly at\r\nthe temperature of from ninety to ninety-five degrees, which I have\r\nfound to be as high as the roots of the plants are able to bear. I\r\nwould, therefore, say ninety degrees to be the standard height, which I\r\nhave myself adopted, allowing it to fluctuate down. If our succession\r\nPine-pit had been altered to have been heated by steam, as the fruiting\r\none is, which the boiler is perfectly able to do, the saving in tan\r\nalone would more than pay the interest of all the money laid out on\r\nerecting the whole steam apparatus.\r\n\r\n“The above is my candid opinion on the subject, as far as my practice\r\nhas enabled me to speak. I am, &c.\r\n\r\n  “JAMES DODDS.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe best stoves for combining the culture of the Pine and Vine in\r\nScotland, have been constructed by Mr. Hay, of which fine examples\r\noccur at Lord Duncan’s, Lundie-house, near Dundee, and the Earl of\r\nRoseberry’s, at Dulmeny-park (_fig. 23._), near Edinburgh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 23]\r\n\r\nAs substitutes for tan, leaves are the common resource, but any\r\nvegetable matter of slow putrefaction may be employed, as chopped spray\r\nof hedges or copse, wood-shavings, saw-dust, &c. and in Scotland, it has\r\nbeen found that flax-dressers’ refuse keeps up a moderate heat for a\r\nlonger period than any other material.\r\n\r\nThe mode of employing the vigour remaining in the old stock or plant\r\nafter the fruit is cut, to nourish, for a certain time, the sucker or\r\nsuckers which may be growing on it, was practised by Speechly; but\r\nscarcely to the extent which it has been carried lately. This, we think,\r\na considerable improvement, if kept within certain limits; but, if\r\ncarried too far, what might be gained by the sucker coming earlier into\r\nfruit, would be lost by the retardation of the plant’s own suckers.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 3. 1818. “A Queen Pine, grown by Peter Marsland, Esq. of\r\nWoodbank, near Stockport, was exhibited to the Horticultural Society. It\r\nweighed three pounds fourteen ounces, measured seventeen inches in\r\ncircumference, and was peculiarly well-flavoured. The singularity of\r\nthis Pine was its being the produce of a sucker which had been removed\r\nfrom the parent-root only six months previous to the time the fruit was\r\ncut. The plant on which the sucker grew had produced a fruit, which was\r\ncut in October, 1817; the old stem, with the sucker attached, was\r\nallowed to remain in the Pine-pit till May, 1818; at that time the\r\nsucker was broken off, potted, and plunged into a fresh pit; it soon\r\nafter showed fruit, which, in the course of four months, attained to the\r\nweight and size above stated. Mr. Marsland is in the practice of\r\nproducing Pines in this way with equal success and expedition. His\r\nhouses are all heated by steam.” _Hort. Trans._ iv. 52.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of Oct. 1819, specimens of the New Providence, globe, black\r\nAntigua, and Enville, were exhibited, all which were produced in a\r\nsimilar manner to the above. P. Marsland considers, that “though not of\r\nthe largest description, yet as far as beauty of form and richness of\r\nflavour are concerned, they would not yield to fruit of more protracted\r\ngrowth.” The success which has attended this gentleman’s mode of\r\n“treating the Pine, so as to insure the production of fruit within\r\ntwelve months from the cutting of their previous produce, has been\r\nperfectly satisfactory;” and the following is his account of it. “In\r\nNovember, 1819, as soon as the fruit had been cut from the Pine plants,\r\nwhich were then two years old, all the leaves were stripped off the old\r\nstocks, nothing being left but a single sucker on each, and that the\r\nstrongest on the plant; they were then placed in a house where the heat\r\nwas about sixty degrees, and they remained till March, 1820. At this\r\nperiod the suckers were broken off from the old stocks, and planted in\r\npots from eight to twelve inches in diameter, varying according to the\r\nsize of the sucker. It may be proper, however, to observe, that the\r\nlength of time which the young sucker is allowed to remain attached to\r\nthe mother plant, depends in some degree upon the kind of Pine; the\r\ntardy fruiters, such as the black Antigua, and others, require to be\r\nleft longer than the Queen, and those which fruit readily.\r\n\r\n“After the suckers had been planted, they were removed from the house,\r\nwhere they had remained while on the old stock, to one in which the\r\ntemperature was raised to seventy-five degrees. Immediately upon their\r\nstriking root, the largest of the suckers showed fruit, which swelled\r\nwell, and ripened between August and November, being, on the average,\r\nten months from the time the fruit was cut from the old plant, and\r\nseven months from the time the sucker was planted. The fruit so\r\nproduced, though, as may be expected, not of the largest description, I\r\nhave invariably found to be richer and higher flavoured than that grown\r\non older plants. The suckers of inferior strength will not show fruit in\r\nthe same season, but in the following they will yield good fruit, and\r\nstrong suckers for a succeeding year’s supply. Those suckers are to be\r\npreferred which are produced on plants that have ripened their fruit in\r\nNovember, for those taken from plants whose fruit is cut in August, or\r\nearlier, are apt to show fruit in January or February, while yet\r\nremaining on the mother-plant. But whenever this happens, the sucker\r\nshould be broken off immediately upon being perceived, and planted in a\r\npot so as to form a root of its own, to maintain its fruit.” _Hort.\r\nTrans._ iv. 392.\r\n\r\nThis experiment shows what can be done; though it must be obvious that a\r\nconsiderable part of the saving in time is lost by the small size of the\r\nfruit. Mr. Baldwin, in our opinion, has hit on the proper use of this\r\nmode, the principle of which, as already observed, consists in the\r\nemployment of the otherwise lost vigour of the old stock. He contrives\r\nto produce tolerably sized fruit, and to have such a degree of vigour in\r\nhis suckers, as that they are able, in their turn, to throw out other\r\nvigorous suckers to succeed them. In aid of this, he often earths up the\r\nold stock, so as to cover the lower end of the sucker; and partially\r\nwrenching it off, he, by these means, obtains for it a good stock of\r\nroots before he renders it an independent plant.\r\n\r\nWhere heat is to be supplied from fermenting horse-dung, we should\r\nrecommend for trial a pit invented by J. West, of Castle Ashby, in\r\nNorthamptonshire. (_fig. 22._) Nine years’ experience enable its\r\ninventor to recommend it for neatness of appearance, the power of\r\nregulating the heat to the greatest nicety, and for forcing asparagus,\r\nstrawberries, and the most delicate kinds of cucumbers. By raising the\r\nwalls of the pit higher above the earth, it is evident it would answer\r\nequally well for growing Pines, or forcing shrubs or tall growing\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe dung is placed in a chamber (E) three feet and a half deep, being\r\nabout eighteen inches below the surface-line; the walls (G) which\r\nsurround it are nine-inch brick-work; both on the front and at the back\r\nof the chamber are two openings (A), about two feet six inches square\r\neach, with moveable doors, through which the dung is introduced; the\r\ndoors fit at bottom into grooves (B), and are fastened by a wooden pin\r\nand staple at top. In front of the doors, is a small area (C) sunk in\r\nthe ground, surrounded by a curb of wood, by which the introduction or\r\nremoval of the dung is facilitated. Along the centre of the chamber is a\r\nbar (D), which serves as a guide for packing the dung; and across the\r\ntop, at intervals of twelve inches, are placed, on their edges,\r\ncast-iron bars (H), two inches wide, and three quarters of an inch\r\nthick, to support a layer of small wood, bushes and leaves (I), over\r\nwhich is laid the soil for the plants (K). Just below the level of the\r\nbars all round the dung-chamber, are holes (F), passing in a sloping\r\ndirection through part of the wall into a cavity (G) in the upper part\r\nof the wall at the back front and both ends of the pit. In the exterior\r\npart of the back wall, are holes with plugs (L), to let out the steam\r\nand heat at discretion.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of forcing, half the chamber is filled\r\nlongitudinally with dung, and if the doors are kept shut, this will\r\nafford sufficient heat from twelve to eighteen days. As the heat\r\ndeclines the other half of the chamber is filled, and the temperature is\r\nkept up by additions to the top of the dung, on either or both sides, as\r\nit settles. When the united heat of the two sides ceases to be\r\nsufficient, the side first filled must be cleared out, and mixed with\r\nfresh dung and replaced, and so on, adding and turning as circumstances\r\nrequire. _Hort. Trans._ iv. 220.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 24]\r\n\r\nAs an improvement on the construction of this pit, we would suggest the\r\nperforation of the whole of the side walls (_fig. 24. a_), in order to\r\nadmit the steam more readily than it can find admittance by the single\r\nrange of openings adopted by Mr. West. Where pits on Mr. West’s plan\r\nare already built, a substitute for this perforation in the side walls\r\nmay be found in the application of a wattled hurdle against them (_fig.\r\n24. b_), as has been adopted by Mr. J. B. Mackay, in the Comte de\r\nVande’s garden at Bayswater.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._--All the schemes of improvement detailed in this section, are\r\neither of a nature never to become general, if they do succeed, as that\r\nof Count Zuboff; or not yet sufficiently proved by experience to be\r\nrecommended for adoption, as the application of steam as a bottom heat\r\nby Mr. Hay. We therefore leave them to work their way with the public;\r\nand, in the mean time, till these, as well as Mr. Knight’s experiments\r\nhave established something better, we recommend all those who wish to\r\ngrow the Pine Apple in the first style of excellence, and at a moderate\r\nexpence, to adopt the pits and houses of Mr. Baldwin or Mr. Aiton; and\r\nto imitate their practice, or that of Mr. Andrews.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LONDON:\r\n  Printed by A. & R.
