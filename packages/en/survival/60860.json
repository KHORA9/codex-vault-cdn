It was driven ahead of the\r\nwind like a shred of rags, the car trailing behind at a fearful angle,\r\nfor many of the ropes were broken and all the others were twisted in a\r\nhopeless tangle. Nearly all our ballast had fallen into the angry sea\r\nbeneath us an hour after the storm first caught us in its whirl.\r\n\r\nI could hear the ocean roaring and swashing, where its gigantic waves\r\ntoppled over each other below. The sound must have been tremendous, for\r\nthe wind blew such a howling gale that neither Ford nor I could make\r\neach other hear what we shouted two feet away.\r\n\r\nOur hats were gone; Ford’s face was haggard, whenever the lightning\r\nrevealed him in the gloom. So intense was the darkness that I could not\r\neven see the vast bag above us. When a great flash illuminated the\r\nheavens, directly ahead, I noted the monster globe full of gas,\r\nsilhouetted blackly against the glare, and knew it was slightly leaking.\r\nA small three-cornered dent was in its side already. I also observed\r\nthat the sea was hardly more than fifty feet below, churning milk-white\r\nfoam in its fury out of liquid ebon waves of mountainous size. The sky\r\nseemed like a solid bank of black. The darkness that followed the flash\r\nabsorbed even Ford. Yet I knew that while he clung to the basket with\r\nhis right hand, as I had done for above an hour, he was nevertheless\r\nattempting with his left to heave out the bag of provisions and the\r\nblankets. I helped him at this and we rose perceptibly.\r\n\r\nWhere we were it was absolutely impossible even to guess. That the\r\nballoon was driving ahead at more than sixty miles an hour we had long\r\nbeen convinced. This had been the state of affairs throughout the night.\r\nI had lost all confidence in Ford’s calculations at the end of the\r\nseventeenth hour out from Burma, for the twist which the storm had given\r\nus then threw out or broke every reliable instrument we had, leaving not\r\nso much as a compass. I was not an aeronaut like Ford, yet I knew we\r\nwere doomed, unless some change should occur, and that quickly.\r\n\r\nFord, by the light of a flash, had seen a rope which was sawing open a\r\nseam in the silk, as it slashed and writhed in the tornado. When another\r\nblinding illumination came, I saw him climbing up in the ring to cut\r\nthis rope away. The car tilted more than before; I fully expected to go\r\nhurtling out at every jerk. Suddenly two ropes, worn to a thread, on the\r\nring, parted without the slightest warning. The car gave a lurch and all\r\nbut turned bottom-side up. I heard a cry, as I swung out full length,\r\nsuspended by my arms, and was even slightly struck on the foot, as Ford\r\nwent plunging down. The balloon shot upward, relieved of his weight, and\r\nI was alone.\r\n\r\nHow long I clung there, swinging far out behind the wounded machine, is\r\nmore than I would dare to say. My arms finally ached so intensely I\r\ncould scarcely endure the pain. Dangling ropes beat me like knouts, for\r\na time, and then wrapped and twisted about me like coils of a snake.\r\nObviously these must have supported my weight at the last, for in a\r\nspell of dizziness and weakness I lost my grip and then was conscious\r\nonly a second, when I thought, with the utmost unconcern, my end had\r\ncome. Like a dummy on the tail of a kite, I dragged below the wreck of\r\nthe car and was whirled thus unconsciously on, above the hungry sea.\r\n\r\nIt might have been hours, it might have been days after this last moment\r\nof despair, when my brain began again to work. I can only describe the\r\nsensations which followed as a species of dream. I thought I was dead;\r\nit seemed as if my soul, or something, was at perfect rest in a region\r\nof loveliness. Whereas I had been chilled through and through by the\r\nstorm, I was warm now and filled with comfort. Music, which might have\r\nbeen the rustling of leaves or the songs of birds, made itself heard. I\r\ncould not see for my eyes remained closed; but a sense of delicious\r\nodours pervaded my being; I seemed also to float, as if on the air.\r\n\r\nAt length I opened my eyes. The dream continuing on me still, I lay\r\nperfectly quiet, gazing aloft into a sky of matchless beauty. Doubtless\r\nI remained in this position for more than half an hour. Then a bright\r\nbird flitted across my range of vision, and brought me back to things of\r\nearth. I was still bound about by a piece of rope. Everything came back\r\nto me sharply,—Ford, my friend, the scientist and daring balloonist, our\r\nstart, the storm, his hurtling down to death, my own desperation, and\r\nthen oblivion.\r\n\r\nI was whole and sound, apparently. Removing the rope and attempting to\r\nsit erect, I found myself floundering for a second, in the top of a\r\ntree. The branch I was on let me drop. I fell toward the earth, made a\r\ngrab for a limb, which somewhat broke my fall, and landed plump on the\r\nground, in the midst of a circle of extraordinary beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                           A STRANGE ALLIANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nNeither men nor apes, yet clearly creatures which were nearly the one\r\nand on the verge of being the other, these inhabitants of the place had\r\nevidently been observing my form, in a spirit of cautious curiosity, for\r\na number now came swinging down from trees adjacent to the one I had\r\noccupied, and the ones upon the ground set up a series of singular\r\ncries.\r\n\r\nHaving landed on my feet, hatless, but otherwise stoutly clad, I threw\r\nmy hand to my belt, instinctively, desiring to arm myself against\r\npossible aggression. I found only my knife remaining. This weapon I\r\nmerely hauled around by sliding the belt, to bring the dagger directly\r\nbeneath my hand. The creatures about me were a score or so in number,\r\nstanding erect, apparently much excited, yet threatening no attack.\r\nTheir movements were restless; their roundish, near-together eyes were\r\nconstantly moving, like those of a monkey; they circled about me,\r\nuttering guttural monosyllables, with many inflections. Every one of\r\nthem gripped in a powerful hand the haft of a rude sort of club,\r\nfashioned out of a rock, lashed firmly to the end of a stout piece of\r\nwood.\r\n\r\nThe mutual inspection between us lasted several minutes. I could detect\r\nbut little difference between any two of the beings. They were nearly as\r\ntall as I, averaging about five feet six inches; they were thin, wiry,\r\nentirely naked, long-armed, flat-nosed, big-jawed and covered, on their\r\nlegs and arms, with a thin and somewhat straggling growth of hair. Their\r\nskin was a reddish light-brown in colour; their feet were large, but\r\nmuch like hands, having the great toe set back like a thumb; their legs\r\nwere slender and poorly shaped, but exceedingly muscular; their\r\nshoulders and backs were round.\r\n\r\nOne of the first to drop from a tree was a giant among them, a creature\r\nmore than six feet tall, active as a panther, commanding in aspect, and\r\npossessing arms that reached fully to his knees. He carried a remarkable\r\nclub which was made of a great chunk of rock-crystal, secured at the end\r\nof a polished bone, large and straight. This crystal still had its\r\ngleaming points and facets preserved; it therefore inspired me with a\r\ndread of the jagged hole it could smash in the skull of the largest\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nAmazed as I was by what I saw, my astonishment was instantly increased\r\nwhen I observed the only female creature I had yet beheld. She issued\r\nfrom a copse and took her place beside the giant, who stood leaning on\r\nhis club, eyeing myself nervously. She was a pure albino. Her hair,\r\nwhich was long and coarse, was as white as foam, her eyes were as pink\r\nas a rabbit’s; her complexion was florid red on white. With a\r\nrudimentary modesty, she stood partially concealed behind the giant,\r\nalthough she was “clothed” in a patch of skin from a pure white gull, in\r\naddition to a sort of rude necklace of claws.\r\n\r\nWhat were they? Where was I? What would they do? These questions I asked\r\nmyself rapidly a hundred times, as the creatures continued to edge about\r\nme and to chatter obvious comments. I could only answer what they were,\r\nand my premature conclusion may have been wide of the truth, yet I\r\ndubbed them Missing Links without the slightest hesitation.\r\n\r\nFor a space of at least ten minutes I was subjected to the closest\r\nscrutiny, during which time I kept the keenest possible watch on every\r\nmovement, behind as well as before me. Resistance, however, would have\r\nbeen madness, had they closed in for a battle. There was evident\r\nindecision among these Links as to what they should do, and I was\r\nequally at a loss to determine what I most desired with regard to\r\nthemselves. I now underwent another sensation. Pushing his way through\r\nthe circle came a fat, waddling “fellow,” who afforded as great a\r\ncontrast to the ordinary Links as did the female albino. He was entirely\r\nblack. As if to render him quite grotesque, his legs were thick and\r\nbowed, his stomach was large and glistening, and his head was crowned\r\nwith a skull, securely tied in place with thongs which passed beneath\r\nhis chin. But his face was so irresistibly comical, with its broad,\r\ngood-natured grin, that I smiled in actual forgetfulness of where I was.\r\n\r\nAt this he approached, holding forth in his hand a luscious fruit, the\r\nlike of which I had never seen. A murmur—plainly of dissent, or\r\nwarning—went up from his companions. Two or three made as if to drag him\r\nroughly back by the leg. I fancied I understood him to be an emissary of\r\npeace, and therefore deciding instantly that I preferred to be friendly,\r\nI took a step forward and held out my hand. With a look of gratitude,\r\nmingled with one of suspicious uncertainty, the fat chap gave me the\r\nfruit and capered clumsily away, out of possible reach.\r\n\r\nGrunts of wonder and perhaps also of relief, greeted my acceptance of\r\nthis overture of hospitality. The Links settled in their tracks, to see\r\nwhat would happen next, many of them standing with arms akimbo and\r\nglancing from me to the giant, rapidly, by which I concluded that he was\r\na chieftain to whom they looked for a final decision of the case.\r\nTrusting that the action might create a salutary impression on the\r\naudience, I drew my knife from its scabbard and proceeded to cut away\r\nthe thick, hard rind of the fruit, paying not the slightest attention to\r\nthe exclamations which followed this exhibition of the sharpness and use\r\nof the gleaming blade. When the fruit was peeled, I put the knife away\r\nand ate as delicious and juicy a thing as ever a man has known,\r\nprovoking thereby a feeling of undisguised pleasure in the Links and of\r\napparent ecstasy in the breast of the fat one who had provided the\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\n“Now,” said I, when the thing was gone, “who are you fellows, and what\r\ndo you want?”\r\n\r\nI was surprised at myself for thus addressing this half-ape gathering,\r\nbut they were smitten temporarily dumb at the sound of my voice. I made\r\na gesture of cordiality and turned completely around in the circle,\r\nfinally holding both my hands extended to the giant.\r\n\r\nThe chatter was instantly resumed. One of their “words,” in a language\r\nwhich seemed to me to be exceedingly limited and primitive, was, as\r\nnearly as pen can write it.\r\n\r\n“Tzheck.”\r\n\r\nHaving caught this I attempted to repeat it, pointing to myself meantime\r\nwith my thumb, for it occurred to my mind that they called not only\r\nmyself but also their species by the name, and I desired to assure them\r\nI was “one of themselves,” for at least they were better than no\r\ncompanions in this unknown land.\r\n\r\nMy action evidently met with approval. They advanced, retreated, pushed\r\neach other near and otherwise exhibited a desire to know what I was. But\r\nstill they had a fear of my presence, although they were now in a mood\r\nof timid friendliness. Up to this the chief of the Links had not\r\n“spoken” a word. He now gave a command, or something of the sort, when\r\neach of the others raised his club to rest it on his shoulder, as if in\r\nreadiness to beat me to death in case a necessity should arise. The\r\ngiant then came boldly up and extending a finger, touched my clothing.\r\nThe feeling of the cloth caused him to tell something to his followers,\r\nall of whom were breathless with attention.\r\n\r\nThinking I understood his perplexity, I quickly unfastened my coat and\r\nshirt, exhibiting the whiter portion of my neck, for the part exposed\r\nwas tanned very much the colour of his own. This action begot a great\r\nenthusiasm, responding to which I pulled my coat off entirely, when the\r\namazement of all was complete. I repeated their word “Tzheck” again,\r\nwhereupon they set up a clamorous conversation in monosyllables, among\r\nthemselves, and came yet closer, the better to place their hands upon\r\nme. The impression was borne in upon me that they knew somewhat of what\r\nI was, but were puzzled by the clothing I wore.\r\n\r\nAll this preface to a mutual friendship and understanding, which I much\r\ndesired as a guarantee of my personal safety, was progressing well when\r\na sudden scream threw all into a state of violent alarm. No sooner did I\r\nturn than I beheld the appalling sight of thirty or forty huge, genuine\r\nourang-outangs, descending upon us from the near-by jungle. Two of these\r\nhad swooped upon the albino female and were struggling to carry her off.\r\nI saw the giant nearly smash the head from the shoulders of one, with\r\nhis iridescent club, and rescue his mate in a second. Then a fierce\r\nengagement commenced about me on every side.\r\n\r\nIt was a horrible conflict. The monster ourangs, half erect, appeared\r\nlike so many fiends, as they launched themselves in overwhelming numbers\r\non the Links, their mouths drooling, and bristling with fangs, their\r\nhatred of the more human creatures expressed by the fury with which they\r\nattempted to mangle and murder all the band. The Links, screaming out a\r\nword which thrilled me as a battle cry of a courageous few whose fight\r\nwas all but hopeless, smote lustily with their clubs, sinking the\r\nrock-end in many a skull, breaking arms, legs and ribs, yet wasting\r\nsuperlative effort from lack of skill and discipline. Although they\r\nfought their foe with more acumen than as many undrilled men could have\r\ndone, I thought they must fly or all be killed, for the odds were too\r\nheavy by far.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the uproar and turmoil, of which I had been the centre\r\nfor a time, a singular snarl, as of triumph, issued from one of the\r\nattacking brutes. He had discovered myself. Immediately half a dozen\r\nwould have rushed upon me, had I not been still somewhat surrounded by\r\nthe Links. As it was, two ourangs rushed in, headlong, to do me\r\nviolence.\r\n\r\nI had been about to fight for my “friends,” and therefore held my dagger\r\nin my hand. I plunged it quickly in the throat of the beast that gripped\r\nmy shoulder, nearly severing the creature’s head from its body. As he\r\nfell I stabbed the other to the heart, but felt so great a rib that I\r\nknew I had reached his life by the merest good fortune.\r\n\r\nThat I then grew hot and eager for blood, I admit. I received the next\r\nthat came with a lunge which ripped him open entirely across the\r\nabdomen. My knowledge of boxing and fencing stood me well. I attacked a\r\nmonster who was all but killing my fat, good-natured Link, and crashed\r\nthe steel fairly through the spinal column at the base of his brain. The\r\nsmell of blood and the flash of that gory knife seemed to affect the\r\nattacking brutes with horror. Yet the next ones that came would have\r\nkilled me outright had not the fat Link beaten out the brains of one and\r\nbroken the arm of the other, which then was readily despatched.\r\n\r\nSeeing the advantage of a club, I clutched up one which an overmastered\r\nLink had dropped, and swung it madly. With this and the knife, I not\r\nonly defended myself but became a champion of the Links as well. The\r\nfight, with its din of thuds and animal shrieks and screams of agony,\r\nbegan to concentrate about three Links and myself. A long, hairy arm,\r\nwith an iron-like hand, was thrust across my shoulder and my throat was\r\nin a deadly grip. I dropped the club and slashed my blade across the\r\nwrist, severing the stiff, white cords. Then I swung in a blow that\r\nburied the steel to the hilt. The brute fell heavily, dragging the knife\r\nfrom my hand. Instantly two more great animals were upon me and over I\r\nwent, already scratched and slightly bitten. For a moment I struggled in\r\ndesperation; then a horrible black face came down toward my own, the\r\njaws awide for a fastening on my neck.\r\n\r\nDown swept a gleaming streak. The rock-crystal club knocked the face,\r\nhead and all, away, as if it had been a potato on a stick. Another blow\r\nkilled my second assailant like a fly might be killed on a window. I\r\nbounded up with a club in my hand. The giant Link was beating his way\r\nthrough the foe like a doomsman. With a cry of hatred and fear, the\r\nremaining ourang-outangs, and many of the wounded, suddenly turned and\r\nfled. The battle had been brief and bloody; it had demonstrated a\r\nfierceness and power incredible in the Links, a power which, if\r\nconcentrated and properly employed, would excel that of twice the number\r\nof human savages.\r\n\r\nI found my knife and pulled it forth from its sheath of flesh.\r\nCollecting his following about him with a word, the giant leader touched\r\nme on the arm and pointed toward the jungle. The wounded of “our” force\r\nlimped from the scene; our dead, who were three in number, were carried\r\nby those who were still unhurt. With the albino mate of the chief I\r\nwalked away, surrounded by the chattering Links, whose conduct toward\r\nme, I was sure, was that of a friendly “people.” The fat fellow was next\r\nto idiotic in his gratitude for the stroke which had saved his life.\r\n\r\nI had fought with them, bled with them, eaten of their food and\r\nendeavoured to show them my good intentions and wishes toward\r\nthemselves. They were manifestly aware of all. I felt strongly drawn to\r\nthe singular beings, alone with them and dependent upon them; I felt\r\nthat for weal or woe I was at least a temporary companion to, if not an\r\nintegral part of, a band of Missing Links.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                         THE HOME OF THE LINKS\r\n\r\n\r\nFilled with strange sensations, thus to find myself in the midst of a\r\ncompany so extraordinary, I kept my appointed place in the march,\r\nlooking about me in an effort to discover what manner of country it was\r\ninto which I had dropped. I wondered what I should do to get back to\r\ncivilisation, and how this could be accomplished, and when.\r\n\r\nAbout us the jungle closed in thickly. Huge trees, gigantic flowers and\r\ncreepers, hanging like intertwisted serpents, and with others like the\r\ncables of incompleted suspension-bridges, convinced me at once of the\r\ntropical nature of the land. We were walking in a rude sort of trail,\r\nwhich I concluded had been formed by some ponderous animal, for the\r\ngrowth had been smashed down or beaten and trampled aside.\r\n\r\nThis trail became uncertain, in the gloom, for soon the light was almost\r\nentirely obscured by the super-abundant verdure. Had any of the Links\r\nmeditated treachery, or to take advantage of me while unprepared, this\r\njungle darkness would have afforded an exceptional opportunity; but on\r\nthe contrary my fat friend waddled actively before me, clearing the way\r\nof branches, and the “person” next behind me was the albino female\r\nherself. Nevertheless I was grateful for a glimpse of light, now and\r\nagain, which gave a promise that beyond we should find something less\r\nforbidding. During this march I noted how silently the Links glided\r\nonward, how lightly they stepped and how alert they were at every sound,\r\nin that silent region of growing and prowling things.\r\n\r\nThus we finally emerged from the forest, into an opening of limited\r\nextent. Here I noted fruit-trees and evidence of former occupation on\r\nthe part, I thought, of the Links, but they left the place behind, to\r\nplunge again through the jungle. A shorter trudge brought us out of the\r\ntrees once more, at the foot of a hill of no considerable height. This\r\nhill we commenced to ascend.\r\n\r\nAt last I could see for a distance about me. The prospect was\r\ndisappointing, almost bewildering. Instead of a glimpse of the ocean,\r\nwhich I had thoroughly expected to get, I saw nothing but hills and\r\nvalleys, clothed endlessly with the dense, luxuriant growth peculiar to\r\nthe equatorial zone, all of it seeming to breathe of heavy blossoms,\r\nheat and the moisture from the universal green. The solitary exception\r\nto this condition of verdure was a bare hill, not half a mile away,\r\ngreen in spots, but evidently volcanic in origin.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the forest we had quitted, a thousand monkeys appeared to\r\nswing from the branches, into existence and then to sway back again and\r\ndisappear. A snake glided off in the rank grass; a flock of birds,\r\ndecked in brilliant raiment, arose with a great confusion of flapping\r\nwings and inharmonious cries. I believed myself to be on an island,\r\nperhaps of the greater Sunda group, but there was nothing in the visible\r\nworld, either to confirm or to deny my theory. I felt that the sea,\r\nwhich had swallowed Ford and which had so nearly been a grave for\r\nmyself, was in reality my best friend, but lost completely, and in which\r\ndirection—who should say?\r\n\r\nSoon I observed that the hill we were climbing was a sort of terraced\r\nmountain, low and broad. As we neared its summit it widened out,\r\nrevealing endless features of beauty and natural provision. It was\r\nwooded with trees in great variety, many of them over-laden with fruits\r\nand nuts; springs of water bubbled forth from bowers of vines and ferns;\r\nbirds and game abounded on every side; and its surface “rolled”\r\nsufficiently to comprise not only hummocks and swales but also ravines\r\nand walls of rock as well.\r\n\r\nAs we reached the edge of the largest clearing I had seen, a chorus of\r\ncries arose from the further side. Immediately the woods disgorged a\r\ngreat collection of Links, young, old, male, female, and babies. All\r\nwere similar to those about me, save that the children were more like\r\nlittle chimpanzees, running about frequently on “all fours,” swinging\r\nupward to the branches of the trees and otherwise exhibiting animal\r\nspirits.\r\n\r\nMore than a hundred of these “inhabitants” came running and walking\r\ntoward us. Many of the males bore clubs, of the usual pattern, while the\r\nyouths were to be distinguished not only by their looks of immaturity,\r\nbut also by the undersized weapons in their hands, not a few of which\r\nwere like toys. Of the whole population, none wore the slightest\r\nsuggestion of clothing, excepting the female albino, mentioned before.\r\nWhat a lot of terra-cotta gorilla men and women they were, as they\r\ndashed out to meet us!\r\n\r\nI found it difficult to be calm as they bore down upon us, yet I was\r\nforced to note what magnificent action was shown in their movements. A\r\ntremendous excitement arose among them when they had me surrounded.\r\nEvidently emboldened by what they were told of my nature, by my\r\n“captors,” yet timid and suspicious of what I might do if aroused, they\r\npresented a singular study of primitive curiosity and caution. The\r\n“women” were bolder than the “men,” a condition of fearlessness which I\r\nattribute to the fact that, like the animals, the males never fought\r\nwith the females nor struck them for what they did. These females,\r\nhowever, although to be classified with animals because of this immunity\r\nfrom punishment by the “men,” presently exhibited the rudimentary\r\nmodesty noted before in the conduct of the chief’s mate, which was\r\ndistinctly a human thing. But this diffidence was not so great as their\r\nnatural desire to investigate, and they plucked at my coat and trousers\r\nbefore many of the newly met males among the number dared to come so\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nThe chief having continued to stalk ahead, we all made more or less\r\nprogress toward the place whence the Links had come. In all the chatter\r\nI could occasionally distinguish the word “Tzheck,” and this I again\r\nrepeated, smiling and nodding as I walked. The creatures amused me, for\r\nI now began to note certain characteristics that made a distinction\r\nbetween one and another. Thus, one of the females carried a large baby.\r\nShe was a sharp-featured “person,” who employed one of her hands to\r\nbrush a straggling wisp of hair from her eye, and the baby as constantly\r\ndragged this wisp again from behind her ear. Another was an “old woman,”\r\nobviously deaf, for she placed her hand behind her ear to listen, and\r\nshe nodded and grinned in the way of people who catch but fragments of a\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nWith this chattering, scampering escort I came to what was evidently the\r\ncamp of the tribe. This was marked principally by the trampled condition\r\nof the earth and the number of lively babies about, on the ground and in\r\nthe lower branches of the trees. There was a large cave in a wall or\r\nterrace of rock. This was apparently used for purposes of sleeping under\r\ncover, or of other protection when needed. Into this place, the dead of\r\nthe band were carried. There was no exhibition of grief, however, and\r\nindeed no one seemed to take any special interest in the corpses. There\r\nwere no constructed shelters about, no signs of permanency nor of\r\nprovision for the morrow. Except for one thing I might now have\r\nhesitated to place the creatures above the highest order of animals, but\r\nthis one thing was conclusive.\r\n\r\nThey made fire.\r\n\r\nAnimals may live together in a colony, and even inhabit caves or burrows\r\nof their own digging, but the animal will always be animal until he\r\nstarts a blaze and cooks his food.\r\n\r\nTheir fire at that moment was merely a smouldering heap of ashes and\r\ncharred ends of wood; there were no utensils about, no suggestions of a\r\nmeal in process of cooking. Presently, however, an old female who\r\nmuttered to herself and who paid no attention to me nor to any of the\r\nexcitement, threw fuel on the embers and blew up a flame, after which\r\nseveral Links borrowed a burning brand with which to start other fires\r\nin various places. Soon thereafter a desultory cooking-bee commenced,\r\neach cook providing for himself.\r\n\r\nTheir process was crude; it consisted merely in spitting a raw piece of\r\nmeat on a stick and thrusting it into the blaze, or the coals, according\r\nto the fancy of the chef in question. When this meat began to burn, the\r\nhungry Link blew it, to cool it a trifle, bit out the smoked and barely\r\nheated spot, and ate it greedily, the while he or she thrust the\r\nremaining piece in the heat for another bit of roasting.\r\n\r\nThe interest in myself had in no wise abated. The majority of the Links\r\nwho had not been of the discovering party, having thrown aside their\r\nclubs, surrounded me still and placed their inquisitive hands on my\r\nshoes and clothing. My knife was a source of awe and wonder. Its bloody\r\nhandle only was visible, yet scores of those who had not been present at\r\nthe fight listened with manifest amazement to what I knew to be\r\nprimitive tales of my prowess, and to explanations of the uses to which\r\nI put the weapon. Even the children, the greater part of whom were as\r\nshy as little foxes, gave over their play to stand behind the trees and\r\nbehind their elders, from which places of safety they peered at me with\r\nshifty, bright eyes. One little monkey-like chap gave no heed to\r\nanything but a noise he was making by clattering several small empty\r\nsea-shells together with all his power and possible speed.\r\n\r\nI missed my comical Link, whom I had mentally nicknamed “Fatty.” He now\r\nappeared with an armful of fruits, and laid them down at my feet. There\r\nwere cocoa-nuts, a melon (papaw), mangoes and other things of which I\r\nnever learned the names. Being exceedingly hungry I assailed these\r\nrefreshments with vigour, to the intense delight of all. Fatty\r\ndisappeared again, returning soon with a bird, half plucked, ungutted\r\nand warm. He stabbed it on a stick, borrowed some fire and gave me the\r\nmorsel to cook to my liking.\r\n\r\nWithout thinking, I glanced about for a pot or a skillet. In a second I\r\nrealized the hopelessness of the situation. The incident served to set\r\nme thinking. I was lost in a land of which I knew nothing; I was safe,\r\napparently, in the company of a tribe of Missing Links; I might not be\r\nable to escape from the place very soon and therefore I must rely upon\r\nmyself, if I were to have anything like comforts, either of food or\r\nshelter. It was a situation to be pondered, carefully. It would\r\ncertainly be folly to attempt to leave these creatures, with whom\r\nperhaps I might be able to exist for a time, without first acquiring a\r\nknowledge as to where lay the sea-coast. I should not only be lost in\r\nthe jungle at once, if I started away, but I should doubtless be an\r\nimmediate prey to prowling brutes. Yet already I began to feel as if I\r\nhad stayed there too long and as if I ought to be starting for “home,”\r\nor back to a land peopled by human beings. I could not imagine myself\r\naccepting the company of these creatures seriously, nor of remaining\r\nlong where they were.\r\n\r\nThe present moment, however, was the most immediately important. I was\r\ntoo hungry to be appeased by fruits alone, but I felt no desire to eat\r\nscorched bird. As I looked about, a novel idea was suggested to my\r\nbrain. Striding forward I picked up a fine large shell—which had\r\ndoubtless once been occupied by something like a giant escallop—near the\r\nsmall ones with which the baby Link was playing. This I washed out at a\r\nnear-by spring, and filled with water. Then I placed it on the ground\r\nand propping it up with stones, conveyed some fire beneath it, to heat\r\nthe water. The bird was speedily prepared, and cut into bits, after\r\nwhich I held out my hand for more.\r\n\r\nThe Links had all abandoned their several pursuits to crowd about. They\r\nwere eager to see what would happen. Fatty was inordinately tickled. He\r\nran clumsily off, with others, and brought me three more birds and the\r\nmeat of some small animal, already in the larder. I was not at all sure\r\nthat my shell would do for a kettle, as I feared the heat would make it\r\ncrack or scale off in pieces. It did crackle, as if about to split, but\r\nthe water soon began to sizzle at the edges and was nicely boiling by\r\nthe time I was ready. All my meat went in, and then I longed for a few\r\npotatoes and a bit of salt. However, I was gratified exceedingly by the\r\nwhiffs of steam which floated away, and I thought of numerous things\r\nwhich I must soon devise.\r\n\r\nBefore my dinner was sufficiently done, I speared out pieces and found\r\nthem good, especially the birds. Then to Fatty and also to the chief—who\r\nwith his albino mate had watched proceedings with flattering attention—I\r\ngave pieces of the meat to try. The exclamations had been numerous when\r\nthe water boiled; the Links were silent now until the leader had tasted\r\nand uttered a doubtful verdict, when grunts, eager questions and sounds\r\nof peculiar laughter ensued. Bits of boiled dinner were sought by many\r\nof the bolder fellows, after which I was obliged to laugh myself, for a\r\ndozen new fires were started and over each a Link or two prepared a\r\npiece of meat—in their usual manner. Evidently stew was not to their\r\ntaste.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                             A RECONNOITRE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether the fruit I had eaten produced a soporific effect, or whether I\r\nwas physically exhausted by my recent experience in the balloon and the\r\nsubsequent events, is more than I know, but in the heat of that day, in\r\nthe camp of the Links, I grew so drowsy that sleep was not to be\r\nresisted. For at least forty-eight hours and perhaps for sixty, or more,\r\nI had not so much as taken off my shoes. Feeling confident of the\r\nfriendly attitude of the tribe of creatures, I finally removed nearly\r\nall of my clothing, made a bed in the shade of a tree and sank at once\r\ninto dreamless slumber. The last thing I remembered was that Fatty had\r\ntaken up a position near by, much as a faithful dog might do, to watch\r\nagainst intrusion. Necessarily my every movement had been observed by a\r\nlarge and appreciative audience of Links.\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon I awoke, amazingly refreshed. Such a chattering\r\nand game of chase was in progress that I sat up abruptly. Every stitch\r\nof the clothing with which I had covered myself, had disappeared. In a\r\nmoment I beheld it, then, in fragments. The male Links—all but Fatty—had\r\ngone off on some expedition, but the females were there in force and\r\nthese had appropriated coat, vest, trousers and shoes. My trousers were\r\noccupied by two different “ladies,” one of whom had a half, pulled wrong\r\nside out. She wore it jauntily on her arm, while the other had both her\r\nfeet inside the other portion, and was consequently falling down at\r\nevery movement, thereby furnishing no end of enthusiasm in her efforts\r\nat marching on dress-parade. My vest had become a breech-clout, ripped\r\nup the back. Evidently instinct suggests robing the legs, for my coat\r\nwas employed in this manner by a female of peculiarly thin proportions.\r\nHer inordinate vanity, begotten of the attention she attracted, was\r\nquite human, as also was the savage jealousy of other females who made\r\nineffectual efforts to rip the article off for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe fate of my shoes concerned me more than anything else, for my feet\r\nwere too tender for tramping about without protection, not to speak of\r\nthe risk incurred from the presence of poisonous snakes.\r\n\r\n“Here,” I shouted, “bring me those things, you critters!”\r\n\r\nThey started in alarm at my voice, but none made a move to restore my\r\nproperty. I then discovered one of my shoes suspended on the breast of\r\nthe tall albino “woman,” hung about her neck by the laces. The other had\r\nfallen to the lot of perfidious Fatty, who, having put it on his foot,\r\nheel foremost, was hopping about on one leg only, while he held the\r\nother, more precious, booted leg as high as possible, and pounded on his\r\ngreat glistening stomach as if executing an eccentric dance to his own\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\nI strode over the ground gingerly, clad in a shirt, and the belt with\r\nthe knife about my waist, going first to the dancer, whom I bowled on\r\nhis back and divested of the shoe, literally before he could say Jack\r\nRobinson. After that I jerked the other shoe from the neck of the female\r\nso quickly that she ran away in alarm to the cave. This latter action\r\nincited a show of incipient resentment on the part of the old female who\r\nmuttered to herself. But inasmuch as she beheld some of the other guilty\r\ncreatures divest themselves of sundry pieces of my wardrobe and flee,\r\nleaving them on the ground, she conceived an idea of the respect my\r\nknife had engendered in the tribe. She therefore stood sullenly watching\r\nme as I made shift to put on my shoes, a pair of leggings and a loin\r\ncloth, which I hastily constructed of the pieces left of my pantaloons.\r\n\r\nThe “lady” with my coat had quickly climbed a tree to avoid being\r\nobliged to deliver the garment. Fatty, bearing no resentment and being\r\nobviously devoted to my interests, gave chase. Although the female\r\nproved the more agile of the two, she fell into the clutches of another\r\nof her sex and between them they tore the coat all in shreds many of\r\nwhich Fatty finally brought to my feet with excessive demonstrations of\r\npride.\r\n\r\nBy the time my toilet was complete, nearly all the females were up in\r\nthe trees, looking down upon me with nervous, questioning eyes. I\r\nreflected how fortunate it was that they were at least partially human,\r\nfor their strength was enormous and had they been unreasoning animals,\r\nand therefore ferocious, they might easily have rended me to pieces for\r\nless exasperation than I had already given.\r\n\r\nI felt ill at ease as it was; I began to be restless, worried, eager to\r\nbe gone. Where had the wind-driven balloon landed me, I wondered? What\r\ncourse had I best pursue? What would these Links do, or attempt to do if\r\nI sought to leave? I could not remain here, under any circumstances, I\r\nsaid to myself. Think how absurd it would be to live with a lot of\r\nMissing Links!\r\n\r\nFrom where I stood I could see the peak of the volcanic mountain, less\r\nthan half an hour’s journey away. Instantly I made up my mind to visit\r\nthis eminence and get my bearings. I might be able to see the ocean\r\nitself; if I could, then the sooner I made a bee-line for the coast the\r\nbetter for me.\r\n\r\nThere was considerable excitement among the “women” when I started away.\r\nThey had doubtless been instructed to keep me there in safety till the\r\nreturn of the males. Fatty made an eloquent verbal protest, singularly\r\nplain to comprehend, although the words were the merest gibberish, but\r\nseeing that I intended to be master of my actions, he followed anxiously\r\nat my heels.\r\n\r\nFortunately there was open country between the camp and the volcanic\r\npile. Nevertheless the way was not all of grass and flowers, for we were\r\nobliged to fight our way through narrow belts of trees and vines and to\r\nscale the sides of several chasms, all but one of which had been formed,\r\napparently, by earthquakes of the greatest violence. In the one\r\nexception, which was the bed of an ancient river, I saw much evidence of\r\nmineral deposits, chiefly iron. Strewn along here, in the sand, were\r\nbright, crystalline formations which I recognised presently as being\r\npyrites of iron. Afterward I thought of these, having remembered that\r\nwith this stuff and flint, a spark of fire may be procured quite\r\nreadily. None of the mineral features held my attention above a moment,\r\nhowever, the peak being the objective point of my march.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for me to express the feverish anxiety I felt to mount\r\nthe summit of that hill. It seemed as if everything depended on what I\r\nshould see from the elevation. Half way up the slope, which was not at\r\nall steep, my weight broke away the top of a ledge of crumbling stuff,\r\nwhich proved to be sulphur of great purity. I had never seen a deposit\r\nof natural sulphur before, although I had read of mines of the mineral\r\non volcanoes of Mexico, notably Popocatapetl. I merely placed a bit in\r\nthe pocket of my shirt and went on. Further up, my attention was\r\nattracted by innumerable fragments of glass-like substance, with dark,\r\nsmoky lines woven through, in the form of a rude feather. Such stuff had\r\noften come to my notice on the mountains of Nevada, where, as boys, we\r\ncalled it flint, erroneously, I was afterward informed. A few pieces of\r\nthis I likewise placed in my pocket, but my main desire was to hurry\r\nupward.\r\n\r\nWe reached the summit, from which all traces of the crater had\r\ndisappeared, through lapse of time since the last eruption, and there my\r\nheart sank within me. There was no sight nor sign of the sea on all the\r\nwide horizon. Far and away below me lay the dark, undulating\r\ncloth-of-green, jungle after jungle and range after range of densely\r\nwooded hills. In one direction, about forty miles away, were mountains\r\nof greater height than the one I was on. These tempted me to hurry\r\nonward toward their peaks, but I knew how vain was such a desire. To the\r\neastward I caught a glimpse of a shimmering lake, hedged about with\r\nforest which I knew to be practically impenetrable.\r\n\r\nAll this panorama was marvellously beautiful, but for me beauty was\r\nmockery. I stood as good a chance to fly over the hills and trees to the\r\nsea as I did of reaching the coast by tramping across the country. I\r\nrealized that without a guide and a force of resolute, hard-working men,\r\nloyal, and afraid of nothing, escape was a dream—a hope as fatal as a\r\nwill-o’-the-wisp.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I determined that I would regain the world I had left in\r\nsuch an amazing manner. Wild dreams of enslaving the tribe of Missing\r\nLinks, whom I should make my warriors, and who would then escort me to\r\nthe coast, danced through my brain. Prodigious schemes for accomplishing\r\nsome superhuman feat—which was wholly vague and constructed of air—made\r\nme twitch with nervous energy. It seemed as if I ought to be able to\r\ngrasp something big—to force the marvellous to come to my aid. Then the\r\nreaction of despair succeeded; all my intangible ideas mocked me with\r\ntheir silliness. I felt inconceivably helpless. The enormity of the\r\ntropical hedge by which I was completely surrounded—a hedge alive with\r\nvenomous snakes, doubtless with tigers, with droves of savage beasts,\r\nand with perhaps more savage men,—this arose in my brain as a picture\r\nwhich made me ill with dread.\r\n\r\n“Great Scott!” I finally said aloud, to myself, “are you such a\r\nmiserable coward, then? By gracious—no! There must be some way—there has\r\nto be a way! Hang it, at the worst a man can merely die!”\r\n\r\nThis speech, which startled Fatty not a little, gave me a new sort of\r\ncourage. I began to think of things I must do to live, and of plans I\r\nmust formulate to explore the country. I nearly forgot that my lot had\r\nbeen cast with the singular man-gorillas, but this was presently thrust\r\nupon my notice by Fatty, who made a noise very like to whining, to\r\nindicate his uneasiness and desire to return to the camp. The sun was\r\nnearly set. I fancied I saw something move, in a tangle far below, but\r\nconcluded this something was merely a shadow.\r\n\r\n“All right, Fatty,” said I, and we started down the hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n                           HOSTILE NEIGHBOURS\r\n\r\n\r\nDoubtless I grew absorbed in thinking, as we made our way to the base of\r\nthe hill, for I was startled by a singular cry from the Link.\r\n\r\nWhat I saw confused me for a moment. Three Links, taller than any except\r\nthe chief of the tribe I had joined, were darting toward us with the\r\nwildest of gestures,—three Links as black as tar. Inasmuch as Fatty was\r\nnearly as dark as they, and considering the treatment I had already\r\nreceived, I felt no alarm and failed to comprehend what the situation\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\nLike a leopard for quickness, Fatty darted away, uttering sounds of\r\nfright. Instantly one of the Links approaching started on his trail in\r\nhot pursuit, a club in his hand which was glinting with colour in the\r\nrays of the setting sun. I was surprised and somewhat amused as I saw\r\nthe clever Fatty elude the larger creature and gain the trees. Once in\r\nthe cover he swung himself upward and out of sight with all the agility\r\nof a monkey.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the two I had failed to watch were upon me. I was thrown down,\r\npinioned to the ground a second and then dragged up, hastily. Then the\r\npair began to hustle me off with astonishing force and with method in\r\ntheir frenzy, for they attempted to get me away as nearly unharmed as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\n“Here!” I cried in a moment, endeavouring to check my progress, “let go\r\nof me—you devil!”\r\n\r\nI had hardly noted their faces, but now, as I struggled, I saw that the\r\ntwo were tremendously like a pair of burly Negroes. That they were\r\nLinks, as much as the others were, that indeed they belonged to the very\r\nsame species and genus, there could be no doubt, but they were as widely\r\ndifferentiated from “my” Links as a black ant is from one that is red.\r\n\r\nI jerked myself loose from the grip of one, by losing a part of my\r\nshirt, and struck him a blow on the point of his jaw that laid him flat\r\non his back, stunned and helpless. I was annoyed by the liberties they\r\nwere taking, more than angered or rendered desperate. I therefore kicked\r\nthe other in the stomach and beheld him double like a hinge. A chorus of\r\ncries arose at this and I looked about to discover ten or a dozen more\r\nof the fellows, all black, swarming up the slope to assist their\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the third one, who had ceased pursuing Fatty and\r\nreturned, launched himself upon me from the rear and bore me down. Fight\r\nas I would, he was the equal in strength of three of my build and easily\r\nkept me on the ground till four of the others, quickly followed by their\r\ncompanions, rushed to the scene and secured my arms and legs.\r\n\r\nThere was no resentment, as far as I could determine, for the blows I\r\nhad given the two. The pair, in fact, soon regained their senses and\r\nbreath, respectively, and joined their kind, in a dazed and half-hearted\r\nmanner. I was aware that I was being considerately handled, though\r\nroughly, to be sure, and was quite unable to think of a reason, until\r\nthe fellows began again to convey me away. I realised then that they\r\nwere actually abducting me and proceeding straight away from the camp I\r\nhad left. Had I been a thing of rare value and highly prized by the\r\ncreatures, they could not have acted with more care to avoid inflicting\r\nan injury on my body, nor with more resolution in their obvious plan to\r\ncarry me away to their own retreat.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the Babel of tongues and confusion of getting me across\r\na chasm, to which we came with surprising promptness, a cry resounded\r\nthrough the cleft, and instantly a force of the red Links leaped down on\r\ntop of the Blacks and commenced a furious attack. I was dropped as if I\r\nhad been a cumbersome rock, but landing on my feet and clearing myself\r\nof the scrambling fellows, who shot forward to meet the onslaught of the\r\nReds, I whipped out my knife, prepared to defend myself at any cost and\r\nto fight for my friends, if I mingled at all in the fray.\r\n\r\nThe battle with the huge ourangs had been hot enough, but this present\r\ncombat exceeded all bounds, in the rage of the creatures pitted against\r\neach other. I could see at once that Reds and Blacks were old-time foes,\r\nas sure to fight on contact as are the different coloured ants. They\r\nsmote at one another with the wildest ferocity. Club crashed on stone,\r\nand rock thudded fearfully on skull and ribs, till blood splashed widely\r\nabout the place and heads were pulp.\r\n\r\nIt had all occurred with surprising abruptness. The contending bands\r\nwere inextricably mixed; they surged together and swayed from wall to\r\nwall of the chasm, yelling defiance, snarling in wrath, groaning with\r\nagony. The crunch of bones and the thuds of those terrible clubs against\r\nnaked flesh were awful to hear, yet the fight was such a whirlwind of\r\naction that no one thing could hold the attention a second, where deaths\r\nand mighty actions, and the crude but deadly club-play made a picture of\r\nsuch close-knit battle.\r\n\r\nOne second I noted the great chief of the Reds mow down two of the\r\nBlacks at a single swing of his blood-painted, light-flashing club of\r\ncrystal; the next I noted how like the writhing of a snake was the death\r\ncontraction of one of my friendly Links. Then the flash of a club\r\nswinging quickly to its living cushion of ribs and flesh made a\r\nbrilliant streak against the background of dusky forms. I saw that the\r\nhead of this weapon was a massive nugget of gold. In that second I also\r\ndetected a movement from the corner of my eye where a black creature,\r\nwounded and desperate, was rising up, club in hand, to strike me down.\r\nIt flashed upon me instantly that the Blacks, if they could not possess\r\nme themselves, would rather I were dead than allied with their enemies.\r\n\r\nI was standing with my back to the wall, willing to see fair play, but\r\ntoo wise to become entangled in that medley of physical giants. The\r\ntreachery now revealed made me angry in a second. The smell of fight in\r\nmy nostrils had been working on my animal nature; a pin-prick would have\r\nbeen sufficient to arouse all my human frenzy for slaying. I turned\r\nabout, burning with wrath, and had no more than struck down the wounded\r\nmonster than three others leaped to perform the office in which he had\r\nfailed. A reeking club was swinging in toward my head like a shot from a\r\ncannon. I dived below its line of motion and drove home my knife with\r\nall the lust of vengeance. My falling antagonist tripped and overtoppled\r\nthe second, destroyed the blow he was about to aim and made him an easy\r\nmark for the dripping rock-crystal that crushed his shoulder and part of\r\nhis neck to a boneless mass. The third met another of my friends and\r\nbeat him down, only to be killed himself a second later.\r\n\r\nShrieks of agony had rent the air and screams of rage and yells of\r\ntriumph made discord as a number of the black Links now fled abruptly\r\ndown the chasm to escape. And the fellow with the nugget club turned to\r\nhurl his defiance and to shake his reddened fist at me, as I stood on a\r\nrock in a circle of my friends. The cause of the Reds I had made my\r\ncause; I had slain a Black. The feud between these warring tribes\r\nincluded myself. I had created deadly enemies in the land of Missing\r\nLinks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n                          LANGUAGE AND WEAPONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe darkness had begun to descend before we reached the camp, plainly\r\ncausing anxiety to the Links, who were hindered on the march by the\r\nburden of several dead members of the tribe. Various sounds issued from\r\nthe jungle, where brutes that eat flesh in the night were beginning to\r\nprowl. Doubtless no few of these smelled the blood that laded the wind\r\nwhich was sweeping down through the chasm.\r\n\r\nI thought of all this and meditated much also on my peculiar situation.\r\nWhy these two opposing bands of Missing Links should so desire myself as\r\na prize as to fight with such fatal results, was a puzzle too deep for\r\nsolution, considering that I had been treated by both parties in a\r\nmanner far from being inimical to my safety. Were they cannibals, I\r\nasked myself, did they desire me for a dinner? Manifestly such was not\r\nthe case, inasmuch as no man-eating creatures should be expected to be\r\nso moderate as to permit me to live in freedom as long as I had lived\r\nalready in their settlement. No, their purpose involved something more\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nThere was no end to the chatter as we hastened “home.” Though I failed\r\nto understand this, yet the gestures were easy to interpret. Reason also\r\nmade it plain that Fatty, when he fled from my side and escaped the\r\nBlacks, had darted toward the camp to give the alarm, meeting on the way\r\nthe Links who had come to the rescue, they having started beforehand on\r\ninformation furnished by the females, who had watched us start toward\r\nthe peak.\r\n\r\nI recapitulated the results of my exploration. I was hopelessly lost, as\r\nfar as any human beings were concerned. I was in the hands of friendly\r\ncreatures, more primitive than the lowest mortal. My only chance of\r\nescape lay in cultivating the friendly feelings and in endeavouring to\r\nunderstand my companions, with a view to inducing a force, later on, to\r\naccompany myself on a march across the country to the sea. Incidentally\r\nI had much to do to keep myself partially civilised. I must fashion\r\ntools, in the use of which the Links must be instructed. We were\r\nsurrounded by dangerous animals, and we had a powerful enemy, the force\r\nof whose numbers might be greater than our own. This would mean that I\r\nmust make our tribe superior, and arm them with a better class of\r\nweapons. Fortunately the country promised to be one of great resources.\r\nYet the only tool I had with which to start was my knife.\r\n\r\nI thought of the endless array of implements of war and peace to be had\r\nin the poorest modern community. Such meditation being idle, I reflected\r\nhow glad I would be to hammer out my own requisites from the crude iron,\r\nbut this was equally vain. In short my thoughts came tumbling down the\r\nage of iron and the age of bronze, as if I had fallen back through time\r\nand history, to land at the very age of stone itself. Here I must work\r\nwith stone for hammers, axes, drills and even for an anvil, supposing I\r\nhad my white-hot metal ready to forge into shape, for there was nothing\r\nelse to be had.\r\n\r\nAll this made me excited, eager to be at work. I was forgetful of all\r\nthat it meant, as my brain pictured stage after stage of this new\r\ndevelopment, but when a cool night wind blew across my half-clothed\r\nbody, I was aroused from my reverie and confronted by a pitiless array\r\nof facts. I then foresaw personal suffering, mayhap a miserable death,\r\nand toil and disappointment, before I could wrest even something small\r\nfrom the fist of Nature, while I should have about me a tribe of\r\nsemi-animal beings, fighting constantly for a bare existence. My hope\r\nand fate were rapidly being entangled with the lives and fates of these\r\nextraordinary creatures.\r\n\r\nBefore we reached the camp, the glow of fires shone brightly through the\r\ntrees. The Links had learned the use of a lively blaze in keeping off\r\nthe beasts of prey. I wondered how they had first started their fire,\r\nadmitting that I should doubtless find no end of trouble if I were\r\nobliged to kindle one myself, without a match.\r\n\r\nWe were met by a large and enthusiastic band of the males, with Fatty in\r\ntheir midst. His capers, at seeing me whole and hearty, were enough to\r\nshake an ordinary individual to pieces. He made me ponder on another\r\npeculiar thing. How did it happen that he, being black, was not only\r\nliving among the Reds, but was also at feud with the fellows of his\r\ncolour? I made up my mind that he was either a freak, like the albino,\r\nborn in the tribe, or else that he had been captured when a baby, and\r\nreared away from his kind. It was certain the black Links recognised a\r\nfoe in the fellow, whatever his pedigree and blood.\r\n\r\nHaving conceived an idea, I was glancing about at the trees revealed by\r\nthe glow of the fires, when I discovered a growth of stuff wherein there\r\nwas a large portion dead and dry. Going to this, amid evident protest\r\nand questionings on the part of many Links, I took out my knife and cut\r\naway some likely looking branches. The wood I found to be exceedingly\r\ntough. It was hard work to get what I wanted. On bending it over, in an\r\neffort to break it off, where my cut had been made, I found it to be\r\nexceptionally elastic and stubborn, although I could see it had been\r\ndead and seasoned for many months. Getting out a long straight shaft,\r\nhalf as large as my wrist, and several other straight pieces a trifle\r\nlarger than a pencil, I brought it all to the circle about the fire.\r\n\r\nThe Links, who were much excited over recent events, watched my every\r\nmovement with the gravest concern. I faced them and attempted to convey,\r\nby signs and pantomime that I intended to make a bow and several arrows\r\nwith which I could kill six of the number in the briefest time. They\r\nunderstood enough to be highly amused and delighted. There were an\r\nincredible number of things they did and said of which the meaning was\r\nclear, and with comparative ease I made Fatty understand that I wished\r\nhim to boil me a dinner in the way he had seen me do already.\r\n\r\nFatty, I believe, was one of the most intelligent of all the Links. He\r\nmade blunders enough in doing what I wished, while I tried to keep at\r\nwork on my bow, yet he was insanely anxious to do me any favour and\r\ncrazy with delight at being considered worthy of employment. Dinner\r\ncooking went forward again in the same desultory manner I had noted\r\nbefore, but a large majority of the Links sat or stood about me in the\r\nsemidarkness, seeming more than ever like apes as they glanced about\r\nwith their nervous, round eyes, chattered their monkey-like language,\r\nand released the muscles of their long, uncanny arms. The glow that was\r\ntossed from the fire, making silhouettes of many an astounding red\r\nstatue, painted a weird picture that night beneath the trees.\r\n\r\nAs I looked in their faces, many of them drawn with the first vague\r\nefforts of thinking, I beheld strange, fleeting promise of things to be,\r\ndim lights, as it were, of ambitions—desire to grasp a something just\r\nbeyond their mental capacity. Many seemed awed by the simple sight of\r\nthat knife, cutting away the stubborn wood in thin, smooth shavings, as\r\nit flashed in the light.\r\n\r\nI put my finger on the blade. “Knife,” I said, “knife.”\r\n\r\nA few, including Fatty, attempted to repeat the word. A chorus of\r\npeculiar laughter followed and the spell of awe was gone. As I worked,\r\nthen, I pointed to various things and gave the name in English. There\r\nwas not even one of the Links who failed to comprehend that I was making\r\nan effort to establish a means of communication between us, but a very\r\nfew only tried my easy lessons. Fatty, however, was quite willing to\r\n“make a fool of himself,” for he essayed everything, manfully. But\r\nbetter than this, the fellow attempted to reciprocate the favour. Thus\r\nwhen I had given a name to the blazing pieces of wood he waited a moment\r\nand then pointing to it earnestly said, distinctly:\r\n\r\n“Ouch.”\r\n\r\nThen he pantomimed burning his finger, and jerked it back, saying “Ouch”\r\nagain. He made it plain that the fire would hurt if touched, that a Link\r\nwould cry “ouch” at the smart, and that therefore a fire was named for\r\nthis cry. When I proved that this much Link language was mine beyond a\r\ndoubt, the ecstasy of my fat friend was most extravagant. Gratified with\r\nhis effort, he soon made me acquainted with the names of a number of\r\narticles. These names were invariably chosen in a manner analogous to\r\nthe one by which they had arrived at “ouch” for fire. For instance, a\r\ngurgle, impossible to set down in letters, was the name for water; a\r\nsound like a thud meant a club; an audible breath through the lips,\r\n(wind), signified a tree. Manifestly such “words” as these defy all\r\nefforts at spelling. I found them difficult to imitate, for the throat\r\nwas largely employed to make the noises and my tongue seemed to be very\r\nmuch in the way. I tried my best, as I worked out my first crude bow,\r\nand when I had finished my dinner I felt that no little progress had\r\nbeen made toward a better understanding all around.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as there was more need for haste than there was for finish on\r\nmy weapon, I made short work of tapering off the ends of my bow and\r\ncutting the notches. I then prepared several arrows, somewhat clumsy,\r\nbut still fairly straight, after which I feathered them all, roughly,\r\nand attempted to break some of the glass-like “flints,” I had found that\r\nday, into shapes that would pass for arrow-heads. This was a most\r\nunsuccessful business. An accident formed the only piece which by any\r\nstretch of the imagination could be conceived as what I desired. This I\r\nbound at the tip of a shaft, with cord similar to that which the Links\r\nemployed on their clubs, but it was hopelessly awkward. Being then\r\nprovided with more of their string, I bent my bow and had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing that it was fairly symmetrical in form and\r\namazingly stout. Indeed, it broke the string, and I feared it had split\r\nat the sudden release, but this was not the case. In excitement and\r\nadmiration, the Links now furnished me with a stouter cord, a cleverly\r\ntwisted deer-gut, or tendon, which was nearly perfection for the\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nFitting my pointed arrow on the string and bidding the Links stand\r\naside, I drew it as far as I could and let it drive at the nearest tree.\r\nThe twang that followed gave me a thrill of delight, as always it had\r\ndone in the days of my youth, and I felt a gush of pride in my veins\r\nwhen the shaft stood quivering in the bark, its head so deeply buried\r\nthat the greatest effort to drag it out merely broke it short off in the\r\nhands of the giant chief.\r\n\r\nThe Links knew not whether to be alarmed or delighted. Again I placed a\r\nshaft on the string. This time I signed for silence and turned the arrow\r\nstraight up toward the star-dappled sky, to give my friends a rough idea\r\nof the height to which the wooden messenger would climb. In the absolute\r\nsilence I drew even further than before. With a swish the arrow sprang\r\nfrom the humming string and disappeared like a bullet as it cleaved the\r\nupper darkness, near the trees.\r\n\r\nI threw up my hand for continued silence. In eager expectation we\r\nwaited. Beat, beat, beat, went my heart as the seconds were multiplied,\r\nthe long stillness proclaiming the distance to which the arrow had sped.\r\nLonger became the time; I was thrilled with pleasure and surprise\r\nmyself; it seemed as if the shaft never would return. How still was the\r\nnight for that minute; not a breath was stirring.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a swish—a plunk! as the leaf of a palm was punctured,\r\nand then a quick, incisive plith! as the shaft was driven forcibly home\r\nin the earth. It had come down about ten good strides away!\r\n\r\nWe hastened in a body to find it. There it was, standing straight as a\r\nline, stabbed six inches deep in the sod and roots of grasses,\r\nand—marvel of accidental things!—impaled upon it, half way up its\r\nlength, was a bat, transfixed in action, still holding in its mouth an\r\nunswallowed moth.\r\n\r\nCircumstance had completely eclipsed my humble skill, for this miracle\r\nof chance made me at once a species of god and devil, in the eyes of my\r\nwonder-smitten companions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n                         IMPORTANT DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the morning I witnessed a primitive ceremony, the burial of the dead,\r\nkilled in our latest battle.\r\n\r\nThe ones who had been despatched by the savage ourang-outangs had been\r\nburied the day before, while I lay asleep beneath the trees.\r\n\r\nThe males proceeded, this morning, to a rocky gulch, not far from the\r\ncamp, where the soil was largely of gravel and bits of stuff which I\r\nthought indicated a chalk formation below. Here they began to dig as if\r\ntheir lives depended on their speed, all of them scratching out the dirt\r\nwith powerful, claw-like hands and sending it flying behind them,\r\nbetween their legs. In fact, they dug like so many dogs.\r\n\r\nIt was surprising how soon they had excavated a great hole, but they\r\nkept at it, hard and fast, taking turns, as if they had learned that\r\ndepth was the only virtue of any vault for the dead. Chunks of rock flew\r\nout, with lesser debris, and some of the pebbles being smooth and round,\r\nI gathered half a dozen as large as a mango and pushed off the dampish\r\nsoil adhering about them. This revealed their colour, which was chalkish\r\nwhite. I could not rely upon my limited knowledge of geological\r\nformations, yet I thought the pebbles looked very like chalcedony.\r\n\r\nOn a large rock, with another for a hammer, I struck one of my pebbles,\r\nwhen it split most neatly in twain. The inside had a moist appearance\r\nthe like of which I had never noted before, but it was decidedly like\r\nflint, and I was therefore confirmed in my classification. Well\r\nsatisfied with myself, I struck a half again, when I succeeded in\r\nsplitting off a thin, flat section. Astonished at the manner in which\r\nthis substance broke, I selected a neater “hammer” from among the rocks\r\nand began to knock off chips from my fragment, and almost before I could\r\nbelieve it myself, I had a crude arrow-head of which I felt I need not\r\nbe ashamed. I was thoroughly amazed. Had I discovered a stone which lent\r\nitself peculiarly to chipping, or had I stumbled upon some flint in a\r\nnatural condition for being worked? I remembered to have heard of rock\r\nwhich certain savages—notably those of Alaska—take from the earth while\r\nmoist, in which condition they carve it with ease, and which\r\nsubsequently grows as hard as glass. I wondered if this were not a\r\nsimilar material. Also I reasoned that savages must always have had some\r\nflint which was capable of being worked with the poorest of tools and by\r\npersons of no intellectual attainments, for all had made arrow-heads\r\nfrom the year of one.\r\n\r\nIn my zeal, I split the original pebble into six thin slabs, nearly all\r\nof them as regular as if I had cut them with a knife. These I wrought at\r\nwith feverish eagerness. Too much haste soon ruined one for any purpose,\r\nbut out of the others I got several heads, which should have been\r\nbetter, but which made me ready to dance with joy, for they suggested\r\nsuch wonderful possibilities, when care and patience and better tools\r\nshould be employed.\r\n\r\nI had quite forgotten the burial, but looked up from my hammer-hunting\r\nin time to see the stiffened bodies of the Links, who had given their\r\nlives in the fray, go rolling down to the bottom of the grave where they\r\nlay, looking terribly human. Then without even a moment’s pause, for\r\nregret or touch of reverent feeling, the Links above turned their backs\r\nupon the bodies and began to scratch the dirt once more into place. A\r\npang of sympathy welled up in my breast, for the brave fellows so\r\nlightly considered. I breathed a little hope that their rest might be\r\nthat of peace.\r\n\r\nBefore the hole was full I had gathered together a lot of the pebbles.\r\nLater we all piled rocks on the grave till no animal of the jungle could\r\nhave dug out the bodies in a week. I signified then that I wished my\r\ngeological collection carried to camp, and this was accordingly done.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the cave, I selected a rock for an anvil and others for\r\ntools, for a fit of work was on me. Fruits gave me breakfast enough. I\r\nchipped away rapidly, with never-ending astonishment at the rapid\r\nresults achieved. It was easy even to indicate to Fatty and to one or\r\ntwo others what they could do to promote the manufacture of needed\r\nthings. They were able to cleave the pebbles with reasonable accuracy\r\nand skill. I then made them understand that I wished the smaller pebbles\r\nsplit into thin slices and the larger ones into sections that were\r\nthicker.\r\n\r\nI make no pretence that my arrow-heads were as fine as many a primitive\r\nman has fashioned in ages past, but at least they were sharp and\r\nprovided with shanks for binding them to arrows and, what is more to the\r\npurpose, they accumulated fast. Of the longer pieces of flint I formed a\r\nnumber of spear-heads and knives. Some of these latter would doubtless\r\nhave been as well named had I called them saws. With some pieces I made\r\nwhat I mentally dubbed experimental hatchets. All these things, as fast\r\nas made, were placed in the large sea-shell, which answered well as a\r\nreceptacle.\r\n\r\nWithout interrupting my labours I managed to convey to the marvelling\r\nLinks that I needed more of the wood for bows, arrows and handles. How\r\nthey would manage to cut this material was more than I knew, yet I\r\nreasoned that inasmuch as they must have cut the handles of their clubs,\r\nthey could do the work by some means or other. Their method surprised\r\nme. They built a fire near the place where I had cut the branch for the\r\nbow, and getting a peculiar hard wood into a glowing state, pressed the\r\nincandescent surface against the limbs desired, and then by blowing,\r\nburned them off, not rapidly, but with great neatness. The fiery brand\r\npassed through the wood much as a red-hot iron might in the hands of a\r\nsmith.\r\n\r\nWe were an enthusiastic lot that morning, I directing and working at my\r\nflints, some preparing cords, many scraping handles with bits of the\r\nglass-like material I had found, and with which they were already\r\nfamiliar, while others bound my hatchets to hafts, rudely finished, and\r\nknife blades to smaller odds and ends of wood. It was remarkable how\r\nreadily they grasped the meaning of various things. Their exclamations\r\nof surprise and acknowledgment of the virtue of our growing “arsenal”\r\nfrequently suggested to me a something as if the fellows were surprised\r\nat the real simplicity of all and were wondering why they had never done\r\nthe like before.\r\n\r\nAfter three or four hours the heat of the sun became so great, on my\r\nunprotected head, that I abandoned the pebbles long enough to construct\r\na makeshift for a hat. For this I employed some palm leaves, excellently\r\nsuited to the purpose. The chief eyed all our business with something of\r\na look of sullen disdain. Perhaps it was jealousy beginning to work. He\r\nheld to his precious club of rock-crystal—which certainly gleamed with\r\ngreat beauty in the rays of sunlight piercing through the leaves—as if\r\nit were the all in all that a warrior should require. At his side was a\r\nfawning fellow whom I had marked before as lazy, small-headed and much\r\ntoo fond of grinning, in a manner which conveyed no idea of mirth nor\r\ngood-nature, but which, on the contrary, threw his teeth into disgusting\r\nprominence.\r\n\r\nAt about noon, when I was cramped and tired, from my close application\r\nto the work, I was glad to see a small detachment of our number\r\nreturning from an excursion in quest of meat. It was not until a\r\nsubsequent time that I learned how they drove their game into pits, to\r\nreplenish the larder, but this day I inaugurated a new system of\r\ncooking. It was too great a waste of time for each to cook for himself,\r\nor herself, and the women being employed at nothing more arduous than\r\ngathering fruits and suckling babes, I saw no reason why they should not\r\nbecome the chefs for the tribe.\r\n\r\nAccordingly I soon had two uprights driven in the ground and a lot of\r\nmeat spitted on the green branch of a sapling. With glowing embers from\r\ntwo fires, collected between my uprights, and the wooden spit resting\r\nupon them, I showed a female how to keep the roast turning. Again the\r\nLinks approved of the plan, for they were quick to see that one person\r\nworking in this manner, could cook for all as readily as for one. They\r\nwere restless to be at the meat as soon as the first bit of brown\r\nappeared, but I kept them off, made them replenish the embers from fires\r\nburned down, and then I cut off the places where the meat was done with\r\nmy knife, for general distribution.\r\n\r\nAgain at this meal I was mad for salt. What did these fellows do for\r\nthis requisite seasoning? I asked myself, for I had always understood\r\nthat even savages grow unhealthy, if they lack this mineral, and become\r\nwilling to barter off their souls for a small pinch. There was no\r\nexplanation of the riddle that day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n                         ATTACKED AND BESIEGED\r\n\r\n\r\nWe set to work again in the afternoon, getting out a lot of material to\r\nbe finished later. The following morning I won the regard of all—unless\r\nI except the fawning creature mentioned before—by giving lessons in\r\narchery, another bow and several arrows having been hastily completed.\r\nThe Links proved themselves not only practicable, but most excellent\r\npupils. They were magnificently muscled, to begin with, and therefore\r\nshot with force from the start, while all seemed to possess a natural\r\nknack, as if the weapon had once been theirs and then for long had been\r\nmysteriously lost.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of our “tournament” and while I was walking cautiously\r\nabout, to get a shot at a brilliant bird which had flown into a near-by\r\ntree, a peculiar sound was uttered by many of the Links. The cause of\r\ntheir exclamation was revealed a second later, for moving through a\r\nclearing, not forty yards away, was a large black bear.\r\n\r\nMy heart leaped with excitement. I moved quickly to gain a point of\r\nvantage, raising the bow for a shot, when a dozen of the Links leaped in\r\nalarm between myself and the bear, raising their arms as if in affright\r\nand plainly imploring me not to shoot at the creature. This I thought\r\nabsurd. I believed them to be a pack of cowards who feared the arrow\r\nmight only serve to irritate the brute and so bring down its wrath upon\r\nus all. But in this I was mistaken. As I tried to wave them away—for the\r\nbear would be gone in a minute—they became frantic in their appeals.\r\nThey indicated clearly that if I wished I might try the shaft on any one\r\nof themselves, if only I would spare the beast which had walked thus\r\ndeliberately into camp.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing else for it; the creature disappeared before I could\r\nargue the question. Thereupon a score of males, foremost of whom was the\r\nchief, hurried to the place where the bear had paused a moment and there\r\neach placed his head on the ground with such a show of reverence and\r\nprimitive superstition, that even I could comprehend they attached some\r\ngreat significance to this peculiar visit. When I reasoned how easily\r\ntwo or three with their terrible clubs could have despatched the animal,\r\nI concluded that they all regarded bruin’s visit as an omen of\r\nparticular good fortune.\r\n\r\nI was speculating upon this occurrence when suddenly another cry—this\r\ntime of alarm—startled us all. The males came dashing back from their\r\nadoration of the bear tracks, making a shrill sound of warning and\r\nwaving their arms wildly. The females and scores of others ran pell-mell\r\nfor the cave. Children came swinging down from trees as if the sky were\r\nraining little Links. Mothers fled with babes in their arms. There was\r\nsudden arming of the fighters.\r\n\r\nSomewhat amazed I stood where I was, bow still in hand. Then the reason\r\nfor the visit of the bear was speedily furnished. I was clutched and\r\nhustled off with the others, while with screams of savage\r\nvengeance—which mingled with a war-note, easy to understand,—innumerable\r\nblack monsters swarmed from the woods and charged upon us.\r\n\r\nThe whole fighting tribe of black Missing Links, it appeared, had\r\nsurrounded the camp. They were armed and ferocious, thirsting for\r\nrevenge for the defeat of two days before, and seemed equal to the task\r\nof annihilating all our force. They had frightened the bear there before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIn a time incredibly short, the Reds were in the cave. I was dragged and\r\npushed in among the last. Then I saw my precious new weapons, twenty\r\nfeet away—arrow-heads, spear-heads, knives, hatchets, handles, bows and\r\nall. Tearing away I dashed out to these and brought the sea-shell, with\r\nits contents back to safety. Fatty darted out in my tracks, saving a\r\nnumber of unfinished bows, but the foremost Blacks were almost upon him.\r\nThe chief himself—who thereby testified his high appreciation of the\r\ncollection—leaped from the cave, to get all he could of what we had\r\nmissed. I turned about in time to see him fill his arms and hands. A\r\ngreat black Link bounded swiftly up with brandished club, to smash his\r\nrival’s skull. My whole being thrilled, thus to behold the bravery of\r\nour great red fellow who, leaping like a panther, refused to drop\r\nanything, in such a moment of peril. Cries of warning and of terror went\r\nup from the cave. I jerked up my bow, with a pointed arrow, strung.\r\nLustily I drew against that powerful deer-gut. There was only a foot in\r\nwhich to miss the chief and hit the pursuing Black. The arrow sped like\r\na streak. It struck the murderous creature fairly at the base of the\r\nthroat, crashed clean through his neck and protruded on both sides at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nHe plunged forward, striking such a blow on his face that the arrow was\r\ndriven to the feathers in the hole it had made. A chorus of howls\r\nresulted. The Links immediately on the heels of their fallen companion,\r\nhalted abruptly, in dread and horror, yet on came a hundred behind them,\r\nmad for blood.\r\n\r\nA blunt arrow, shot too high, but which nevertheless struck another\r\nblack Link in the forehead, smashed its way through his skull before it\r\nshattered and split into pieces. Then the crystal club caved in the\r\nchest of the only assailant who had reached the cave, for the chief had\r\nrecovered his fighting position like an elastic spring, and was ready to\r\ndeal a fearful death to any who should dare attempt to enter the\r\nfrowning mouth of the cave. Reinforced by another fighter, the chief\r\ncould almost have stayed the rush of an army, coming in singles and\r\npairs through the open door.\r\n\r\nThis fact the attacking creatures realised quickly. Another of the\r\narrows, which missed the mark for which it had been intended, broke the\r\narm of a powerful Black and compelled him to drop his club. His cry was\r\na signal for all to halt and draw back, to consider what had best be\r\ndone. They had us trapped, but how should they now proceed to beat out\r\nour brains?\r\n\r\nThe last of my arrows was gone too soon, but the visible effect of these\r\nsilent messengers of death was that of terror on the part of the\r\nmystified Blacks. Had we possessed a score of bows, with a quiver full\r\nof arrows for each, in the hands of skillful archers, we should have won\r\na bloody battle and driven the foe away, hopelessly routed, but they had\r\nsurprised us completely, in our unprepared condition, and the situation\r\nwas decidedly theirs in point of advantage.\r\n\r\nBehind me, in the cave, the females and young ones were being sent to\r\nthe rear. There was much excited chatter and much uneasiness of movement\r\namong all the huddled creatures. What the Blacks would do was evidently\r\na matter of great concern.\r\n\r\nOur besiegers decided soon on aggressive measures. They gathered all the\r\nloose rocks, which were practical as missiles, and rushing forward,\r\nhurled them into the cave with tremendous violence. Not a few of our\r\nparty received bruises from the first volley, but many stones missed the\r\ncave entirely and many merely struck the rock walls and so fell\r\nharmlessly down. All that came to hand were immediately gathered, so\r\nthat when the second company advanced to supplement the first fusilade,\r\nthey were met by a fierce return shower of rocks, which stretched two\r\nBlacks on the ground.\r\n\r\nThis business proving unprofitable was not long continued. The Blacks\r\nretired again for consultation the result of which was that more than a\r\ndozen soon lighted brands at our smouldering fires and threw these in\r\nupon us as they darted by the opening of the cavern. No serious injury\r\ncame from this. Our fellows would have flung these fiery spears back\r\nagain, had I not restrained the action. The branches, it occurred to me,\r\nmade torches too good to sacrifice for nothing. I therefore extinguished\r\na number and kept several lighted. These latter we passed to the rear,\r\nin order that our positions might not be revealed to the foe.\r\n\r\nThis throwing in of fire was concluded abruptly when the giant chief,\r\nwatching his opportunity, sprang out, as one of the Blacks was running\r\nby, and battered in his head with the gleaming club. The rage of the\r\nassailants increased momentarily. They saw themselves baffled by a force\r\ninferior to their own, although they had us cornered.\r\n\r\nWith no little anxiety, we watched them detach a company of powerful\r\nfighters and send them off out of sight. This could not indicate\r\nretreat, I knew, for the ones who were left were too expectant. Perhaps,\r\nI thought, this was a blind to make us believe the force was now so\r\nreduced that we could charge them from the cave in safety and drive the\r\ninvaders from the camp. There were, indeed, a few in our party, as I\r\ncould see, who desired to attempt such a sortie, but fortunately the\r\nchief and other wise fellows over-ruled the suggestion.\r\n\r\nWhile we were waiting, restless and worried, the plan of the Blacks was\r\nsuddenly revealed. Amid yells of triumph and hatred, there came a\r\nthundering shower of rocks and boulders from directly above the cave,\r\nfalling down across its mouth, heaping rapidly up, filling the place\r\nwith a stifling dust and obliterating much of the light of day. The\r\nparty detached had gone around and climbed on top of the terrace in\r\nwhich the cave was hollowed out. It would simply have been to court a\r\nsudden death had any of us attempted to dash from the place. Startled,\r\nundecided as to what we ought to do, we stood there paralysed, while the\r\nbewildering Niagara of sand and stone kept rumbling and crashing down.\r\nBefore we realised what was occurring, the barrier had grown to a heap\r\nthat was midway up across the opening of the hole.\r\n\r\nThere were strange cries, roars and howlings, from those behind us.\r\nAbove the din rose the piercing screams of delight from the horde\r\nwithout. All of them now rushed to the spot in a body and began to heap\r\nup all the stones they could gather. Blinded, confused and frightened,\r\nmy friendly Links began to jostle about, in the dread and anguish of the\r\ndoomed.\r\n\r\nIn less than five minutes the last rays of light were being blotted out.\r\nThe sounds of the army still building the barrier higher and thicker\r\ncame dully in. The cave was sealed; we were buried alive in an unknown\r\ntomb!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n                          THE CAULDRON OF GOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the mass of Links in the cavern, the news of the unforeseen\r\ncalamity spread with great rapidity. Some of the females set up a\r\nwailing; the “men” all chattered at once; baby Links caught the\r\ninfection of fear and began to cry. A more demoralised collection of\r\nbeings it would be hard to conceive.\r\n\r\nThe tremendous advantage gained by the Blacks was readily comprehended\r\nby all the older males. They knew, as well as I, that did they attempt\r\nto dig out, the Links in waiting on top of the heap could kill them as\r\nfast as a head appeared; they also seemed to know that their enemies\r\nwould wait outside, long enough to be sure that all of us had starved to\r\ndeath, before they finally decamped.\r\n\r\nSo desperate seemed the prospect that I got in a fever myself. We should\r\nall have been in absolute darkness had not the torches been lifted up,\r\nand these cast so feeble an illumination that the crowded-in mass of\r\nLinks appeared like a great serpent, along the body of which weird\r\nmuscular contractions were flitting. The place was stifling, for the day\r\nwas hot, and here we appeared to get no air. I began to think we should\r\nnever live long enough to starve.\r\n\r\nTo all my attempted questions, by signs and otherwise, concerning the\r\nfurther end of the cave, the chief and others gave answers which were\r\ndecidedly in the negative. They seemed even fearful of the chamber, now\r\nthat we were trapped and unable longer to go out into the light and air.\r\nNevertheless I did not propose to remain there motionless till death\r\nshould bring me to a finish. I therefore made my way through the moving\r\ncrowd, toward the torches. Fatty followed closely. His face was\r\npositively ludicrous in its solemnity, which was oddly mocked by the\r\nskull he wore on his head, for this ghastly thing had slipped rakishly\r\ndown on one side.\r\n\r\nSo helpless and dependent had the Links become, in the face of our\r\ndanger, that it seemed as if they could not bear to let me out of their\r\nsight. In consequence of this all tried to follow where I went, but so\r\ndensely were we packed very soon that this became impossible. The chief,\r\nhowever, thrust himself along in our wake, apparently bidding the others\r\nbe still and remain where they were. Taking one of the torches I worked\r\nmy way past the last of the females and youngsters—the latter like\r\nfrightened little monkeys, unable to escape me and dreading to be\r\ntouched—when I soon came to what seemed to be the wall at the end of the\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\nThe light was so poor that for a moment I failed to discover a small\r\nhole to the right. Into this I thrust the lighted brand. To my great\r\ndelight it cast a glow on the walls of a cavern beyond, quite as wide as\r\nthe one we were in and the end of which was not in view. Believing that\r\nanything was better than stagnation in such a tomb as ours, I attempted\r\nto kick off the edges of the hole, to render it large enough for a man\r\nto pass. I succeeded in breaking away one small fragment only. My knife\r\ncame out and I should have sacrificed its point and edge to widen the\r\naperture, had not the chief pushed me gently aside. With his magnificent\r\nclub he smote the rock a score of giant blows, knocking chunk after\r\nchunk into the gloom beyond.\r\n\r\n“That’s good—that’s enough!” I cried finally, and climbing through with\r\nFatty almost on my back, I beckoned to the chief to follow with all his\r\npeople. I reasoned that nothing could be worse than to remain where we\r\nwere, no matter where this passage might lead—or end.\r\n\r\nMisgivings were rife, but the chief was evidently in undisputed command.\r\nSome of the Links followed eagerly, others with moans of doubt and fear.\r\nNothing so much resembles the sound they made as the uneasy whining of a\r\ndog that is driven or dragged to a place of which it has a terror, but\r\nthis sound was magnified till it filled the place.\r\n\r\n“Ouch,” I said to them, pointing to the torch, “ouch.”\r\n\r\nThey understood and lighted more of the brands from the one just behind.\r\nThe added light gave them added courage. The tunnel we were now in was\r\nspacious, and cooler. The floor was rough with rocks, yet I think we\r\nmade excellent time. The passage wound and its grade was uneven, up for\r\na space, then down, then level.\r\n\r\nIn half an hour I came to a halt, for the rock hall-way divided; a\r\nbranch led off to the right and another went off to the left. In order\r\nto save time, should the wrong one be selected first—if there was a\r\nwrong one,—I determined to go up the left-hand passage alone. If I came\r\nto an exit I could hurry back and bid the Links to follow. If, on the\r\ncontrary, I discovered any barrier which compelled retreat, it would\r\ncertainly be better for one only to be obliged to return, instead of\r\nall, and then we could make a trial of the second tunnel. Enough of this\r\nI was able to convey to the chief to make him content to wait. He\r\ninstructed the Links to sit down on the floor, setting the good example\r\nof patience himself.\r\n\r\nFatty felt privileged to dog my heels. As a matter of fact I was glad\r\nenough to have him go along, for the place was none too cheerful at the\r\nbest. We came upon difficult walking presently, and also the corridor\r\nnarrowed down. I believed it would end in a mere fissure, yet I could\r\nnot afford to condemn it, nor to decide where it went, without a\r\nthorough trial.\r\n\r\nAfter plodding a mile in this stuffy place, we climbed a jagged heap of\r\nfragments and paused abruptly, for the sound of a roaring and rumbling\r\ncame from the darkness in a manner most disagreeably impressive. It\r\ncontinued a brief time only and then the ringing silence of a sepulchre\r\nensued. We resumed the onward march. Passing down an incline, where the\r\nrocks slid under foot, I fell heavily and rolled toward the bottom.\r\nUnable to stop, I dropped the torch and underwent an instantaneous\r\nsensation of fear, as I continued downward toward the abyss of night.\r\nThen Fatty clutched me by the ankle; we slid together a second longer,\r\nand stopped. He lifted the torch. I was on the brink of a yawning\r\nprecipice.\r\n\r\nA chill flashed down my spine. Most cautiously I arose and took the\r\nlight. There appeared to be no bottom to the pit.\r\n\r\n“Gee whizz!” I muttered.\r\n\r\n“Gee wizz!” said Fatty, with remarkable distinctness.\r\n\r\nI looked at the creature in a sort of wonder. Animal or man, my heart\r\nsent a great gush of feeling all through my being toward him, as I saw\r\nhim smiling fondly in my face. He should always have my friendship after\r\nthis. I could almost fancy the old fellow was wagging a tail all to\r\npieces, such a light was in his restless eyes; and yet his face was\r\nalmost that of a fat, good-natured Negro.\r\n\r\nBeing careful where I stepped, I moved along the edge of a great well,\r\ncame to a place where the shelf widened, and found myself facing a short\r\nhall, at the end of which there was light, dim and diffused. We were\r\nsoon at the limit of our journey in this direction, for here also the\r\nprecipice terminated the passage.\r\n\r\nAs I looked below I saw that vapour was rising, as if from heated rocks.\r\nThen I made out fissures in the floor, fifty feet below us; and this\r\nfloor was covered with peculiar excrescences, half-hidden by the steam.\r\nWhen revealed, these resembled stalagmites, melted and slumped down like\r\ngreat nodules, “double-chinned,” I am tempted to write, but “double”\r\nwould not express the multiplicity of “chins.” These nodules appeared to\r\nbe of the brightest yellow colour, but so often were they veiled in the\r\nmist that I could not be sure of anything concerning their appearance\r\nand formation.\r\n\r\nPresently, while I was trying to study the odd features of the place, as\r\nwell as to determine the source of the light, the rumbling and roaring\r\nwe had heard before recommenced. It was louder, more awe-compelling, for\r\nit came from the fissures directly beneath us. It seemed to go booming\r\nupward and through the cavern as if the god of the under world were\r\ngrumbling out a huge complaint. This noise increased, in wave-like\r\nvolumes; the rock gave a tremor, and then with a seething and hissing,\r\nwith a tumble of sound which issued from the depths of the\r\nearth-creature, as if it were growling at having to work, a great geyser\r\nof boiling water and steam shot upward and toppled back to its bed. I\r\nreeled away, with an involuntary movement. Below, the water swashed\r\nabout and foamed in mighty agitation. The cauldron heaved up swirling\r\ntides and the drowned murmur burst forth through bubbles. The giant\r\nbelow gathered anew a mighty strength and blew up a fountain as high as\r\nwhere I was standing.\r\n\r\nI saw a falling blob of the water strike on a small projection near my\r\nfoot. Then the demonstration ceased, the roar became subdued, as if the\r\ngrumbler withdrew to his realm of molten substance, and only great\r\nclouds of the vapour arose as before. The projection where the water had\r\nstruck caught my glance, for assuredly it possessed a remarkable gleam.\r\nStooping I looked at it closely. It was a nodule of something metallic,\r\nshaped somewhat like a small pear. I touched it, finding it barely warm;\r\nthen I grasped it firmly and gave it a wrench. It came away from the\r\nrock in my hand.\r\n\r\nBy its remarkable weight, its colour and its lustre, I knew it instantly\r\nfor gold. It was solid gold, Nature’s own deposit—a nugget most\r\npeculiarly constructed. I knew in that moment that all those massive\r\nnodules below had a right to gleam with yellow colour, for all were\r\ngold—the purest gold, from the great inscrutable laboratory of earth\r\nitself!\r\n\r\nI recalled what I had read and learned of the waters and acids mingled\r\nwith the molten interior of the planet; how they dissolve the precious\r\nmetals, hold them in solution and come with them bubbling to the\r\nsurface, spouting through the fissures in the crust; how through the\r\ncenturies they deposit atom by atom of their rich freightage on the\r\nrocks, permeating the very tissue of stones and porous substances, to\r\nleave them at last all streaked and flaked with gleaming yellow; and\r\nthen how the fluids retire, the earth cools down, and man—ages\r\nafter—comes wandering by and delves day and night to rob the fissures of\r\ntheir hoardings.\r\n\r\nI knew that below us a monster treasure-house was being filled by this\r\nwonderful process, slowly, surely, regularly, hour after hour, while\r\ngeneration after generation of men came and strove and went to their\r\ngraves, willing to bargain off souls to know where to get but a little\r\nof this cold, glinting metal of the earth. We had come upon the hoary\r\nalchemist and caught him at his work.\r\n\r\nBut the pit might as well have been a mile in depth, as far as reaching\r\nthe wealth, or the outside world with which I believe it connected, was\r\nconcerned, for we had no means of getting down in the place and its heat\r\nwould have made this impossible, even if we had possessed the best of\r\nladders or ropes. All the gold in the world, moreover, was worth no more\r\nthan so much dross to me; the dream of emerging again to the light was\r\nvastly more to be coveted. Reluctantly acknowledging that the diffused\r\nlight which was here probably came from the outside world through a cave\r\nwhich I could not by any possibility reach, I placed the small nugget in\r\nmy pocket, and making sure that the passage through which we had come\r\nwas of no value to me or to the party of Links, I retraced my steps,\r\nwith Fatty following noiselessly behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n                            DAYLIGHT AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were many expressions of relief on the part of our waiting friends\r\nwhen again the forward movement was commenced, in the right-hand tunnel.\r\nThose at the rear had become particularly anxious; the darkness was\r\nevidently a source of much vague alarm.\r\n\r\nThe passage we were now in was inclined downward. It wound in a general\r\ndirection at right angles to the one which led to the cauldron of gold.\r\nIn places it became so low that we were obliged to creep on hands and\r\nknees. This condition finally prevailed, so that I began to believe we\r\nwere wedging ourselves into a crack. If this were true, then the case\r\nwould be worse than hopeless—it would be most horrible. The death, one\r\nby one, of all the Links, in such a place as this, would be appalling to\r\nthe last degree.\r\n\r\nI went steadily on, my knees growing tender from contact with the rocks.\r\nPresently Fatty and the chief, directly behind me, gave a low\r\nexclamation of affright. I halted, but heard nothing. Perhaps they were\r\nable to smell some enemy, for certainly their monosyllables gave a\r\nwarning, easy to interpret.\r\n\r\n“What is it?” I said, as if they could understand and let me know.\r\n“What’s the matter?”\r\n\r\nThose behind made low sounds of worry. It made me desperate. If anything\r\nconfronted us now, it was too late to pause; there was no such thing as\r\nturning back. I drew my knife and advanced, feeling cold creepers go\r\ndown my back. It might be the den of a tiger I thought, but surely such\r\na beast would prefer to run out rather than to face so weird a foe as we\r\nwould have seemed to be, proceeding through the cave, for we made a\r\nstrange sound, moving, breathing and expressing our various emotions.\r\n\r\nFatty was halting, whining, coming on and halting again in a most\r\ndisquieting manner. The chief seemed to realise that we might as well\r\ndie in one way as another, yet I noted a look of dread on his face, such\r\nas one often sees in the eyes of a startled horse, when approaching\r\ndangers which he feels by instinct. It occurred to me now that if\r\nanything were in the cave, then the end must be near—an opening to the\r\noutside world!\r\n\r\n“Come on, you fellows,” I said at this, and holding my torch before me,\r\nrounded a corner. Immediately a glimmer of light, through down-hanging\r\nfoliage and vines, revealed the exit we were seeking. Made careless for\r\nthe second, I was suddenly startled most loathsomely. I had placed my\r\nhand on a cold, moving body—a snake which was crawling toward the light.\r\n\r\nElectrified into galvanic action, I plunged my knife into the body of\r\nthe serpent half a dozen times, as fast as I could strike, feeling my\r\nhair “crawling” as I did it. The head of the reptile came backward—a\r\ngreat flat head with bulges of poison-glands making it hideous. I knew\r\nhe was deadly. The knife stabbed clean through his neck and ground on\r\nthe rocks beneath; his jaws stretched open fearfully; his lip receded\r\nfrom the two great fangs, but he was killed, though the body writhed and\r\ntwisted belly upward in powerful muscular contractions.\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” I had said, as I struck.\r\n\r\n“Ugh!” repeated Fatty and the chief.\r\n\r\n“Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!” went echoing back through the cave, as the Links\r\nrepeated the utterance, in dread. I had stumbled on their word for\r\nsnake, or any reptile.\r\n\r\nI thought we should encounter more of the snakes, but not until I had\r\ncome, most cautiously, to the growth which formed a door to the cavern,\r\ndid I see anything move. In the vines a few inches of tail were\r\nintertwined, but before I could deliver a good stab, this serpent\r\nescaped. I now slashed away tendrils and creepers in a sort of frenzy,\r\nfor the darkness and closeness of the cave had oppressed me with a\r\nfeeling which developed into horror. We in the lead were soon out, on a\r\nsmall bluff, overlooking a dense wood; indeed there was jungle all\r\nabout. I heard not a few sounds of crashing branches, where heavy-weight\r\nanimals made away from the neighbourhood and sound of our voices.\r\n\r\nWhat a strange sight it was to see the cave pouring forth that\r\ncollection of ape-like Links. Nearly all were chattering—not\r\ntalking—like so many monkeys, frightened to the point of being crazy. On\r\ngetting out into the light, not a few ran about as if they would leave\r\nus altogether and hide in the trees. The fighters, however, huddled the\r\nfemales and young ones together, and glanced about and at me, with their\r\nround, restless eyes, as if to know what to do next. Left to themselves\r\nthey would doubtless have soon been self-reliant and capable of thinking\r\nand acting for themselves, but having followed me blindly, through an\r\nordeal totally foreign to any previous experience, they were hopelessly\r\ndependent upon me now. This I knew, for even the fawning creature was\r\nhumbled.\r\n\r\nI knew also that our old “home” would have to be abandoned and a new one\r\nmade. I was likewise aware of the necessity of selecting a place which\r\ncould be more easily defended—a point of vantage. This base we must\r\nsecure as speedily as possible, for already the sun was nearly down.\r\nStudying the faces of the calmer Links, as they looked about, I was not\r\nencouraged to believe they knew where we were, with regard to the\r\nabandoned camp. To get my bearings I went up the hill we were on, to the\r\nedge of the jungle. From there I was able to see a portion of the lake\r\nwhich I had seen from the volcanic peak. Above this water, on the summit\r\nof a hill, was a clear space, discernible, with rock formations and\r\nindications of springs. If it had fruit-bearing trees it would be nearly\r\nright for our needs and purposes.\r\n\r\nFatty and several others, including the chief and his albino mate,\r\nhaving followed me up the hill, I indicated the spot to which I desired\r\nthem to lead the way. They comprehended and conveyed the whole plan to\r\nthe tribe in about three separate monosyllables, whereupon we made a\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n                           A CAMP ON THE HILL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe found signs of wild animals in great number and variety, as we forced\r\nour trail through the jungle, but so considerable a concourse of\r\ncreatures as ours was sure to frighten anything and everything from the\r\nline of march. It seemed to me to be a place in which company was\r\nexceedingly desirable.\r\n\r\nA feeling of relief came over me when at length we reached the clearing\r\nwe had selected from afar, and made our way to the rounded summit of the\r\nhill. No sooner had I signed for a halt than half a dozen of the\r\nfighters advanced and laid at my feet the sea-shell receptacle, filled\r\nwith our flints, and everything else which had been saved when we fled\r\ninto the cave, all of which had been carried at great pains through the\r\ntunnel. These things I had quite forgotten in our stress of cares.\r\n\r\nThe place we had reached proved to be ideal for a settlement. Not only\r\nwere fruit and nut-trees abundant, but the forest contained countless\r\nwoods of value, while huge bamboos were flourishing not far away, at a\r\nmarshy spot, and the hills and ravines about us were teeming with birds\r\nand game. We held a commanding position, the rock-formations of which\r\nmade a natural fortification nearly complete. Through the trees, in one\r\ndirection, I could see the lake, a thing which gave me the greatest\r\ndelight, for I thought it might mean almost anything to me, later on.\r\n\r\nAlthough we got the benefit of a cooling breeze, the end of the day was\r\nintensely hot. While we had been out of the tunnels probably no longer\r\nthan about an hour and a half, yet the whole adventure made the day seem\r\nvery long. Thirsting for water, I hastened down the side of our hill to\r\nwhere I saw signs of a spring. Clear water, sure enough, was gushing out\r\nof a fissure, and I hastened to drink. The first mouthful fetched me up\r\nstanding, bitterly disappointed. The water was salt. For a second I was\r\nready to curse the living fountain, and then I fairly danced with\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nSalt! The only thing I really needed, and the rocks and banks of this\r\nlittle stream were white with the precious incrustation! I lost no time\r\nin scraping some off the pebbles at the edge, after which I got some\r\npure, cold water for drinking at another spring a hundred yards away. I\r\nhad known of hot springs and cold springs, almost side by side, in\r\nNevada, and of sulphur springs and iron springs and countless other\r\nvarieties, but it had never before been my fortune to drink from a\r\nspring of brine. This elated me beyond anything yet discovered.\r\n\r\nBefore I could rejoin the main body of my fellows, a few were striking\r\noff hap-hazard, for rations. Some vigorous sign-language, which I found\r\nI could make more forcible if I also talked out what I wanted to convey,\r\nin Anglo-Saxon, begot a show of order. Twenty fellows went after fruit\r\nand nuts for all; as many crept into the woods to dig some pits and\r\nattempt to drive in some game; others fetched wood for the fires, as\r\nwell as for more of the bows and arrows. I had a lot of the females\r\ngather a species of tough reed, much resembling osiers, and although I\r\nknew little of weaving, I succeeded in making a small, clumsy basket,\r\nwhich at least served to initiate the scheme, but it took some time\r\nbefore we achieved any results worth mentioning in this needed line of\r\nutensils.\r\n\r\nAt the head of a gang I began to supplement our natural ridges of rock\r\nwith a wall made of piled-up stones. It would never do to be defenceless\r\nagain. During all our work and hustling about, the chief stood leaning\r\non his rock-crystal club, his albino mate at his side, and the\r\nfawning-fellow—whom I named Grin—smiling maliciously at all I did. The\r\nchief saw a certain amount of usurpation in my ordering the work. The\r\nnew mode of things amazed him, for the Links not only had a keen\r\ncomprehension of what I wanted, but they actually vied with one another\r\nin the zeal with which they laboured to perform my bidding.\r\n\r\nDarkness came on before we had accomplished much in any direction. The\r\nold female who muttered had preserved a glowing coal from the torches, a\r\ntrick made the easier by the wood she employed, for it possessed the\r\nproperty of retaining fire for a time incredibly long.\r\n\r\n“Here, Granny,” I said to her, as if by habit, “make ouch here, ouch\r\nover there, and ouch against the rock.”\r\n\r\nBy the light of the flames, I constructed a rude shelter for myself. The\r\nLinks had a way of massing up in bunches on the ground, to sleep, a\r\nsystem which hardly appealed to my fancy. Already two or three dozen of\r\nthe youngsters were curled on the ground and were doubtless deep in\r\ndreams.\r\n\r\nWe ate no meat that evening, for the hunters came back empty-handed, as\r\nsoon as the light began to fail in the woods. An hour after night had\r\nsettled down, they were all at rest, save Fatty and myself. I sat before\r\na glowing fire, thinking, wondering what would come, out of this strange\r\ncaper of my frolicsome fate. I planned out work, with escape for my\r\nmotive, and builded strange structures in the air, as I looked vacantly\r\ninto the embers. Fatty watched me eagerly, his nervous eyes as lively as\r\nquicksilver. The light shone on half of his face and illuminated the\r\nskull tied on top of his head, with a changeful glow. He tried his best\r\nto remain awake and help me to think it all out, but his head would nod,\r\nand his eye-lids insisted on drooping, till at length he slumped, rather\r\nthan curled down, fast asleep.\r\n\r\nHow long I sat there, getting drowsy myself and intending all the while\r\nto go to my shelter, is more than I know. A scream woke me suddenly at\r\nlast. The moon had nearly set, but still was casting a mellow light on\r\nthe world. A mass of the Links made a singular picture, as they\r\nscrambled about in a great confusion. Then out of their midst leaped a\r\nmonster beast—a long, thin tiger, with a female Link, now flung upward,\r\nnow dragged, now half across his shoulder, held in his mouth, and she\r\nfairly splitting the air with her cries, as he ran away with her bodily.\r\n\r\nI saw the brute clear the ridge of rock and bound down the slope to the\r\nregion of shadows, like a thing of evil; I heard a Babel of affrighted\r\nchattering; I heard roars and howls and death-songs, out in the jungle\r\nwhere the creatures held carnival of blood. I saw the fear of my\r\nmen-children, huddling about me; and I felt a longing to hover them all\r\nfrom harm.\r\n\r\nThey were badly demoralised, but we built up the fires anew, and made\r\nmore, to enclose all the tribe. Then for hour after hour I walked about\r\nthe camp, keeping the fires from dying away, while out in the savage\r\nworld beyond, the prowlers ate, and growled at the “kill.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n                              A DEADLY FOE\r\n\r\n\r\nAt sunrise, when all the Links were actively awake, there appeared to be\r\na strong inclination, on the part of many; to leave this new settlement\r\nand flee to the woods. The visit of the tiger had terrified the females\r\nand not a few of the fighters. The fawning creature, Grin, was the\r\nmoving spirit in this scheme of flight, but the chief could not be\r\nreadily persuaded to leave when he saw that I was strongly opposed to\r\nany such measure of retreat.\r\n\r\nI knew the tribe to be more or less nomadic, and I believed them capable\r\nof finding a clearing wherein we could live, by constantly fighting the\r\njungle brutes, yet I was convinced that the welfare, not only of myself,\r\nbut of all concerned, would be better served by remaining where we were.\r\nAttempting to show them how we could guard ourselves against future\r\nenemies by adopting various measures, I set them the example of working\r\non the wall and of building sheltered dug-outs, succeeding at last in\r\nquieting many fears and convincing the chief that we were the safest on\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\nAll day long we toiled at sundry occupations, but the work to accomplish\r\nwas great and the efforts of my workmen, though the fellows were strong\r\nand willing, were so crude that progress was slow. We needed weapons,\r\nmore than anything else, unless I except the shelters. I worked\r\ncontinuously at making bows and arrows. In this labour I was\r\nconsiderably assisted by three Links whom I finally selected as the most\r\ningenious and teachable fellows of the tribe. To my great delight I\r\nfound that my flints had already become exceedingly hard from being\r\nexposed to the air. This rendered the hatchets and knives remarkably\r\nefficient as tools.\r\n\r\nThe fighters dug seven or eight large, shallow holes in the earth,\r\nduring the day, and a few were covered with branches of trees and\r\nthatched with enormous leaves before evening. What with helping to carry\r\nstones for the wall and wood for various purposes, the females\r\naccomplished but little on the baskets which I had hoped they would\r\nmake. They were not as practical as the males, having never been obliged\r\nto construct so much as a blanket or a string of beads.\r\n\r\nAs a relaxation from my other employment, I busied myself with weaving a\r\nbasket, that night by the fire. The material was none of the best, and I\r\ncould only guess how the work should be done, nevertheless I succeeded\r\nin finishing an awkward affair which would hold above a bushel of fruits\r\nand which required two men to carry it home when filled.\r\n\r\nFor two more days we swarmed that hill-top like a colony of ants. At the\r\nend of that time we had three good fire-places, builded of stone,\r\nthirty-odd bows, more than eighty arrows, four baskets, nine tolerably\r\ndecent dug-outs, and a wall nearly completed about our city. Also we had\r\nplenty of meat, for the hunters had driven some goat-like deer into\r\ntheir pits, after their primitive fashion, not to mention a number of\r\nbirds cleverly captured. In this latter business they utilised a sticky\r\nsubstance procured from a weed-like tree, the stuff being plastered on\r\nthe branches of trees much frequented by the birds, which, alighting,\r\ngot their feet, feathers and wings quickly gummed, so completely that\r\nescape was impossible. I was anxious to have the fighters begin practise\r\nwith the bows, but as yet we had been too busily engaged with work for\r\nany such diversion.\r\n\r\nJust before evening that day I strolled to the edge of the jungle, with\r\nthe faithful Fatty at my heels, to try for a shot with some of our\r\nlatest arrows. The chief being away, at the head of a hunting company, I\r\nwaved back all others who would have followed. We found nothing to shoot\r\nat but a squirrel, and this lively little animal evaded me time after\r\ntime, as I stepped quietly about.\r\n\r\nI was just on the point of raising the bow at last when from almost\r\nunder my feet a fine turtle started to run toward a heap of rocks. He\r\nwas almost round and his back was unusually high, so much like half a\r\nsphere was his shell. Immediately I thought what an excellent bowl or\r\nbasin this would make, and thereupon abandoned the squirrel and started\r\nafter the tortoise.\r\n\r\nHe moved much faster than one might have supposed possible. Nevertheless\r\nI lifted him plump on his back with a movement of my foot, and then I\r\njumped violently away. I had almost trodden on a hooded snake, which\r\nstruck at my foot most viciously and then attempted to escape.\r\n\r\nFatty lost no time in getting too far away to be of any help. I tried a\r\nshot at the reptile with the bow, but missed. The creature would have\r\nescaped in a moment. I dropped everything to gather up some rocks, and a\r\nlarge one of these I succeeded in smashing upon the creature so hard\r\nthat it broke his back and pinned him down, close behind the head.\r\nDespatching my turtle then I hastened back to camp.\r\n\r\nIn the great sea-shell I boiled the turtle, not without the greatest\r\ntrouble. The Links ate the meat, for I felt no hankering after this\r\nspecies after one trial. The shell was all I had expected, when at last\r\nit was clean, for I had felt the need of a basin in which to wash.\r\n\r\nWell satisfied with the work of the day, and having impressed a trio of\r\nLinks into service as guard for the night, I turned in early and soon\r\ndropped off into the heaviest sort of slumber. Sometime in the night a\r\nhideous noise and a violent jerking at my foot brought me suddenly to my\r\nsenses. I rushed out, bowling over Fatty in my haste, to find the Links\r\nagain verging on insanity from fright.\r\n\r\nThe man-eating tiger had crept upon us again and borne off one of the\r\nvery guards themselves, who had gone to sleep promptly, upon my\r\nretiring.\r\n\r\nI believe I cursed the wretches who had slept at the post of duty, for I\r\nhad much to do to restore the slightest resemblance to calm among the\r\nexcited creatures. Then in the morning, as I thoroughly expected, the\r\ntribe was unanimous for deserting the works at once, to go\r\nanywhere—whither they cared nothing at all,—so long as they put the\r\ndeepest jungle between themselves and this dreaded foe. A tiger such as\r\nthis, I could see, created a terror as great as the Links could contain.\r\nThere was no suggestion of a courage sufficient to battle with the\r\nbrute; there was one adequate scheme only, in their minds and this was\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nSituated as we were with that lake below us, on which I had builded a\r\nvague sort of hope, I was determined to go the utmost bounds before I\r\nwould consent to move a yard. I pantomimed in desperation and jabbered\r\nfairly good English and added my few words of bad Linkish (or Lingo), to\r\nmake them understand that I would undertake to kill the man-eater\r\nmyself, that coming night. Even this “announcement” appeared to be in\r\nvain, for a time, especially as I had to work against the wretched\r\ninfluence of Grin, the fawning coward, who had an unmistakable power in\r\n“getting around” the chief. At length, however, my counsel prevailed.\r\nBut I could see that failure to execute my boasted vengeance on the\r\nbrute of the jungle would mean the total overthrow of “my city” and my\r\nhold upon the primitive imaginations of the Links.\r\n\r\nFeeling that if they did leave all behind and plunge anywhere through\r\nthe forest I should be obliged to go along, regardless of the fact that\r\nthis would make my escape even more than ever hopeless, and realising\r\nalso that I had assumed a large contract under any circumstances, I was\r\ndecidedly anxious, the moment after they finally consented to my rash\r\nsuggestion. Indeed, though I kept at the work, as I strove to devise a\r\nplan of attack on the tiger, throughout the morning, I became nervous\r\nand doubtful of my ability to perform the vital deed. My brain seemed\r\ncapable of only the wildest schemes, all of which were as utterly\r\nimpracticable as flying to London for a gun.\r\n\r\nHaving never killed a tiger I knew nothing of his habits, beyond the\r\nfact that he was almost always sure to return to his “kill,” if\r\nundisturbed, on the second night, and even on the third, if there still\r\nremained undevoured portions of his victim sufficient for a meal. I\r\ncould fancy this brute treading silently up to the ghastly remains; I\r\ncould picture him, bloody of muzzle, fierce-eyed, alert and terrible, as\r\nhe dined in his dread loneliness. How I wished that a snake, more silent\r\nthan himself, might glide upon him and strike him deep with its venomous\r\nfangs!\r\n\r\nA snake!—Why a snake to be sure! It suggested just the plan! I had no\r\nweapon reliably stout enough to give him a mortal wound, but I could,\r\nperhaps, bury a poisoned arrow in his blood—a shaft that need but\r\nscratch to do its deadly work. The snake I had killed the day before\r\nmight still be fresh enough to furnish the fatal juice, and then—if I\r\ncould find the mangled body in the jungle, perhaps—perhaps—\r\n\r\nI was more excited and nervous now than before. Three times I was on the\r\npoint of crying quits. Once I was nerved anew by the contemplation of\r\nthe lake and our settlement, which meant that I was working out a plan\r\nof escape, already nicely started. Again, I was hardened to the task by\r\nthe thought that, surrounded as I was in this unknown region, with death\r\nso easy on every hand, I was childish to wish to avoid this one\r\nparticular danger, perhaps only to plunge into others far more awful.\r\nThe third time I was steeled by observing the sneering smile on the face\r\nof Grin, which seemed to mock my show of manhood. This was the thing\r\nwhich made me put all doubt and hesitation away.\r\n\r\nIn the late afternoon, having selected five of the straightest and\r\ntruest of the arrows tipped with flint, and having seen that the\r\nbow-string was stout and reliable, I walked off boldly, alone, and went\r\nto where the hooded snake lay crushed beneath the rock. Until I was out\r\nof sight the Links watched me, narrowly, all of them standing together\r\non the hill. The body of the snake was where I had left it, the tail\r\npartially eaten by something, which must have been desperately hungry.\r\nCutting off the head I pried open the jaws with a stick and my knife,\r\nfinding the poison-glands of great size.\r\n\r\nThe venom flowed thickly out when I tore the sacks open with the point\r\nof an arrow, and although the whole revolting operation made me nearly\r\nill, I fairly bathed the flints in the viscid substance. Holding the\r\narrows carefully from me, to let them dry, I concealed the serpent’s\r\nhead beneath a rock, for I did not wish the Links to know what I had\r\ndone, and so to learn the use of so deadly a creature.\r\n\r\nSkirting the edge of the woods, I came opposite our settlement, at about\r\nthe point where I judged I had seen the tiger disappear, in the jungle,\r\nthe night when he carried away the female from our midst. Here I had not\r\nfar to search before I found trampled grass, vines ripped aside and even\r\nthe tracks of the brute’s massive paws. With a fast-beating heart and\r\nalso with a tremendous desire to turn and run, I stepped noiselessly\r\nalong in this suggestive trail.\r\n\r\nThe stillness, save for the note of a far-away bird, or the quick start\r\nof some porcupine or sloth, frightened from its haunt, was terribly\r\noppressive. I confess to have had a constant feeling as if my hair were\r\nstanding upright on my head, as I slowly made my way into that tangle of\r\ngreenery. The day seemed suddenly to have grown old and dark. I felt\r\nhorribly near to the lair of the man-eater, knowing that he had actually\r\nbeen in the place such a short time before.\r\n\r\nPresently I came upon a clearing which was hardly thirty feet across in\r\neither direction. Approaching the centre of this I started violently,\r\nfor I nearly stumbled across the mangled body of my sentinel Link of the\r\nnight before. I had not believed it could be so near the edge of our own\r\nclearing. The tiger, I thought, had grown thus insufferably impudent,\r\nnot to say indifferent to our nearness to his feast, because he had\r\nnever been hunted, nor even threatened with retaliation.\r\n\r\nThe body was a ghastly sight, so human-looking, so fearfully fresh! I\r\nturned away my head and somewhat retreated. How much I desired to dash\r\nmadly away—out to the sunlight—I can never convey to another mind. I had\r\nno feeling of bravery left; it seemed to me as if the jungle were filled\r\nwith deadly creatures, prowling about me as I stood in the place.\r\n\r\nWhat should I do, now that I had found the spot I had dreaded to find?\r\nWould the tiger come back that night? I felt only too sure that he\r\nwould. Looking about me I saw that a great tree held out a branch which\r\nwas easy to climb. It was such a relief to think of getting off the\r\nground, up out of reach of the creatures which might come creeping or\r\nprowling along, that I waited only long enough to tie the end of a long,\r\ncord-like creeper about my bow and arrows, when I scrambled up in the\r\ntree as if all the fiends of Hades had been upon my track. I make no\r\nexcuse for the lack of courage I felt, for absolutely I could not help\r\nit, strive as I might.\r\n\r\nOnce up on the branch, however, I felt better. Moving along to a bend,\r\nwhere a lot of creepers were thickly interlaced, I found a sort of\r\nnatural seat, not quite directly above the terrible “kill,” below in the\r\ntrodden and red-painted grass. In this seat I could rest my weight, my\r\nposition then being one of half erectness, my feet on the great branch,\r\nmy body leaning against the supporting vines. Drawing up my weapons, I\r\nso disposed four of the arrows that I could easily and safely find them\r\nin the dark—which I tried by closing my eyes. Then I fitted the fifth\r\none to the bow-string and prepared myself for a lengthy wait.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n                        THE NIGHT IN THE JUNGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if I had been in the tree for an age when the sun finally\r\nsank behind the hill. For long the twilight had been dim in the jungle,\r\nand creepers and shadows made a picture of grotesque forms, wrapped\r\nabout and hung as if with serpents, like a weird conception by Doré.\r\nThere was rarely a sound. It seemed like the hour when the day-creatures\r\ncrept stealthily home to caves and covers, afraid they were already too\r\nlate and sure to be overtaken by the prowlers of the darkness.\r\n\r\nOnce I had a fearful up-welling of excitement suddenly flood my being\r\nand make my heart to thump heavily. An armadillo came trotting quietly\r\ninto the open space below me. The movement was what caught my glance,\r\nand for the second I thought only of the tiger. Then the little animal\r\nsniffed that gory object and darted instantly away.\r\n\r\nThe darkness increased. Some early complainer howled out a dismal note.\r\nNow and then there came a rustling sound from the trees or vines. An\r\nhour after the darkness became complete, I heard a pounce, a struggle,\r\nthe quiet moan-cry of something which gave up its life, and it made a\r\nchill go down my back and spread through my nerves. Sounds of birds in\r\nthe air and forest—inhabitants hiding in the trees, came occasionally,\r\nnow, with surprising distinctness. All of this kept me in a high state\r\nof tension. I wished myself anywhere on earth other than where I was. I\r\nconfess the woods at night, where merely bears and owls were at large,\r\nhad awed me earlier in life, and this jungle, alive with poisonous\r\nreptiles and blood-hungry animals, terrified me beyond expression. If I\r\nhad only had a companion, if there had even been another man awaiting my\r\nreturn—somebody to talk to, somebody to think about rejoining, or even a\r\nsoul who would dare to hunt for my body if I never returned,—it would\r\nhave been a little comforting at least.\r\n\r\nI managed, with an effort, to pull myself together a trifle, by thinking\r\nthat it was now too late to meditate retreat. I would not have climbed\r\ndown from my tree and attempted to find my way out of the darksome\r\nforest—taking the chances of starting wrong and getting lost—for the\r\nprice of a mine of diamonds. Thus the hours went by and a score of\r\nthings kept me startled constantly. I feared the tiger would fail to\r\ncome; then I feared he would arrive at any second.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that midnight must have come and gone ages since.\r\nSuddenly my breath came fast, my whole body was rigid with attention as\r\nI noted a dim form, apparently standing in the tangle, directly across\r\nthe clearing. I knew I had become pale; I knew I trembled with\r\nagitation. I was cold and my teeth did their best to chatter, as I\r\nwatched to see if the form moved.\r\n\r\nThere were ample sounds about me, some slight, some heavy, but I think I\r\npaid little heed to anything except that dim, uncertain form. Then I was\r\nsure it moved. While I was still at the height of my excitement I noted\r\na leaf, which became clearly defined. I knew immediately that the form\r\nwas merely a patch of half light, cast through the foliage by the moon.\r\n\r\nThe excitement subsided as if I had pulled out a plug and let it run\r\naway. And while it was going, I heard a wet lapping and chewing, beneath\r\nme, which told me instantly that the man-eater was below and dining at\r\nhis cold and ghastly feast. He had come—unseen and unheard,—while I was\r\nbeing frightened at a patch of light!\r\n\r\nI looked, but so dark was the place that until the monster moved around\r\nI thought his body was exactly on the opposite side of his victim, to\r\nwhich it really was. The excitement had flushed upward in my veins\r\nagain, but not so strongly as before. I was angered, as I have often\r\nbeen to hear a cat lapping at the meat in a cupboard.\r\n\r\nMoving cautiously on the branch, I half stood, half leaned against my\r\nseat and slowly brought my bow into position. I was stiff in my hands\r\nand joints, from sitting so long in one position. Having made a slight\r\nslip and noise, the flood of nervousness leapt upward in me at once; I\r\nperspired coldly; my heart beat a violent measure; in my mouth the\r\nsaliva became like gluey cotton. But the beast below kept on chewing,\r\nwith a horrible noise of drooling chops. I dared not try at him yet,\r\nboth because my hands were too unsteady and because the brute was too\r\nundefined an object to be seen.\r\n\r\nI underwent a trying ordeal for half an hour. While I was watching\r\nbelow, straining my eyes to pierce the gloom, slightly bending the bow\r\nand holding the poisoned arrow in readiness, the tiger shifted about in\r\nhis feeding. Abruptly I saw a patch of his hide, a small irregular\r\ntarget, full in the light of the moon, where a ray shone down through\r\nsome open shaft between leaves and branches. I could see a dark stripe\r\nacross the dusty-looking hide. Even the play of a muscle was visible.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the thrill and ardour of the hunter came to my rescue in that\r\nvital second. I only know that I was eager, steadied, released from all\r\nthat had made me nerveless and cold. I even forgot what a deadly brute\r\nhe was and what he might be capable of doing, if only slightly wounded.\r\n\r\nThe bow became vertical in my fist, at the end of my arm, now as rigid\r\nas oak. I drew the arrow backward to my ear with a strong, confident\r\npull. Then the point came down, toward the lighted patch. I aimed as one\r\naims at the head of a nail with a hammer—with no need to see my shaft.\r\nThen it sprang away like a flash, the twang resounded in my ear, and I\r\nsaw a streak stab straight in the middle of the target.\r\n\r\nInstantly a furious lunge and a roar that all but shook me down made the\r\nplace terrible. I clutched another of the arrows, and fumbled it, so\r\nthat it fell. Another then I got upon the string. All the while a most\r\nawful uproar was continued below. The arrow that had dropped betrayed my\r\npresence. The tiger leaped toward the branch, fell short, leaped again,\r\nthrashed in the grass with frantic force and bellowed a doom-song that\r\nmade my flesh creep on my bones.\r\n\r\nIn his madness the brute was in the patch of light and out again,\r\nconstantly. Once, as he oscillated there for a whole second, making\r\nready to jump toward me, I fired another arrow with all the power of\r\nfear and hatred. It struck him, I could not determine where, and a\r\nmoment later he reached my branch with his two great paws, and hung\r\nthere by his claws, bending the limb so low and shaking all so\r\ntremendously that I clung on for very life. I felt his paw against my\r\nfoot and stamped upon it viciously. He lifted that one; the bark gave\r\nway from beneath the other and down he thudded.\r\n\r\nAgain and again he leaped in his wrath. It sounded as if all the beasts\r\nof the jungle were there in mortal combat. I tried with another poisoned\r\narrow, though I was sick, from my dread that he was proof against the\r\nvenom. This shot I missed. It served to make the brute more furious,\r\nhowever, but finally I thought his ravings began to lose in force.\r\n\r\nOnce more he crouched in the light. This time my last arrow met him just\r\nas he rose in his spring. I failed to notice where it was planted in his\r\nbody, for so tremendous was his leap that his whole head, chest and paws\r\nwere up on the tree. The shock knocked me off; I fell, grasping a\r\ncreeper, that stopped me with a jerk and a painful wrench.\r\n\r\nThe tiger dropped, striking me down the leg with one of his out-thrown\r\npaws; I thought my time had come. With a superhuman effort I chinned\r\nmyself on the creeper, clutched the limb again, got an arm about it,\r\nreached a twig higher up and threw my leg fairly over. I was quickly in\r\nmy old position again, blown, dizzy and wholly unable to believe the\r\ntiger had been evaded by such a clumsy scrambling. He was beating about\r\nin the trampled grass below, but his roar had grown hoarse and guttural;\r\nit seemed no longer so savage. Then I heard his breath blowing froth and\r\nbubbles-of-blood through his nostrils. My heart leaped exultantly—I knew\r\nan arrow had reached his lungs!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n                              AN OLD ROUÉ\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a time incredibly short I heard sounds growing fainter where the\r\ngreat brute stiffened out in the grass. The poison, I knew, had gotten\r\nin its work at last. When the final convulsion had shivered itself out,\r\nwhat a death-silence settled on the jungle! It seemed as if for miles\r\nabout, the lesser beasts had held their breath and fled from that\r\ntheatre of throes and roars of the master-murderer.\r\n\r\nThe hush affected me deeply. I felt so alone with the dead, and yet not\r\nconfident of my safety. My imagination pictured a ring of leopards, cats\r\nand other creatures stealing silently up, like the curious women who\r\nenjoy to look upon a corpse, these all half afraid that the king was not\r\nreally lifeless after all. Probably no creature was then within half a\r\nmile of the spot, for the noise had been sufficient to frighten away\r\neven the snakes, it seemed to me, yet I never for a moment entertained a\r\nthought of climbing down from where I was.\r\n\r\nThe wait, through the midnight and the long chilly hours of morning was\r\nthe harder to bear because of the weakness I felt, after all the\r\nover-wrought emotions I had undergone. It was difficult, moreover, to\r\ncast off the dread of the still brute below me, not to mention the\r\nsounds which recommenced in the animal-haunted jungle. I was exhausted,\r\nfor the strain had been as hard to bear as severe physical labour. In\r\naddition to this, I had performed a good day’s work, before I came to my\r\ntryst with the tiger. How long seemed the time since I left the friendly\r\nLinks, on my quest of vengeance and retribution!\r\n\r\nI may have dozed, as I half lay against the woven creepers, and although\r\nit could not have been for long, dawn had come when I started awake. In\r\nthe forest the shadows were still too deep to be fathomed, yet at last I\r\nmade out the rigid form on the ground. My enemy was almost directly\r\nunder the place where I was sitting. I could see no arrows at all; and\r\nmy mind had pictured him bristling with the shafts.\r\n\r\nSlowly the light increased. What a gaunt, unhandsome form it was in the\r\ngrass! Then the sunlight struck on the tree-tops and bird-notes, not\r\nparticularly musical, began to make more cheerful that dark abode. With\r\na new impulse of courage, I dropped myself down, laid hold of my bow and\r\na leg of the tiger, and dragged with all my strength to get him out of\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nThen I got a good look at the carcass. He was old, wretchedly thin,\r\nscarred about his bleary, dead eyes, nearly toothless and as\r\nworn-looking as an old hearth-rug. I saw where my first shot had struck\r\nhim above the shoulder. The arrow, which was broken off in the wound,\r\nhad jabbed in and plowed along under the skin for six or eight inches.\r\nThe second had ripped through the flesh of his right fore leg, leaving a\r\ngash which the brute had widened when he broke the shaft out, sidewise,\r\nin his thrashing. The last shot had sent the envenomed flint tearing\r\ninto his breast, an inch below the throat, where it had penetrated to a\r\nconsiderable depth. It also was broken, but a tough shred of the wood\r\nstill held the feathered portion dangling from the wound.\r\n\r\nAs I looked on the thin, old reprobate I was silly enough to feel a\r\nlittle pity, so tragic seemed the “poverty” which he had known, as\r\ntestified by his miserable condition. My fears too had been wholly\r\ndissipated by the sun; I wondered why I had been in such a plight of\r\ndread throughout the night.\r\n\r\nA final tug brought the roué of the jungle clear of the undergrowth. The\r\nsecond I emerged to the edge of the hill clearing, a chorus of cries\r\ncame down from the camp. I turned to see the whole drove of Links coming\r\nmadly down the slope from which they had been watching for more than an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nSuch a commotion the simple creatures made, as, crazy with joy and awe,\r\nand still dreading the foe they knew so well, they pressed about me and\r\nchattered and made me a hero and struck at the ground all about the\r\ntiger with their clubs! Fatty went through a sort of blubbering welcome\r\nand got down and licked at my shoes until I felt obliged to give him a\r\ntrifle of a kick. The chief made no effort to conceal his admiration for\r\nmy feat, but he was dignified, after the manner of a great Newfoundland\r\ndog among the lesser canines. His albino mate, however, gazed upon me\r\nfrom her round, pink eyes with a look of worshipping to which I very\r\nmuch objected. At her side the carping Grin was doing his best to\r\nbelittle the tiger and to sneer through his expression of amazement. On\r\nthe whole, one would have thought the tiger a monster and a prince among\r\nhis kind. I began to feel my glory to be somewhat tawdry.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour of tribute, both to the brute and myself, on the part\r\nof the tribe, I rolled the beast over to look for a decent bit of hide.\r\nHe was not worth the skinning, and that is the truth. However, I had my\r\nplan and therefore I whipped out my knife and skinned a part of the\r\nshoulders and back. After this I took off the head, for I meant to have\r\nthe skull for a trophy. Then I directed the Links to dig a grave.\r\n\r\nThey were loth to consign even this partially stripped carcass to\r\noblivion, yet they complied with my wish. Eventually all withdrew to the\r\ncamp above. I immediately set Fatty to work at skinning the head for\r\nboiling,—to rid it of flesh—while I placed my piece of the pelt in the\r\nstream of brine, in order to prepare it for tanning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n                            A GLEAM OF HOPE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I finally fastened the tiger’s skull above my shelter, and girded\r\nmy loins about with the skin, I was conscious of having attained a great\r\nrespect among my primitive friends. Not a few, I soon became aware,\r\nwould have followed me readily in any measure, not requiring too vast a\r\ncourage, even to the point of seceding from the semi-command of the\r\nchief. They attested this feeling, which resembled that evinced from the\r\nfirst by Fatty, in all the work and in various smaller matters, from\r\ndaylight till dark.\r\n\r\nI might have been more flattered than I was at my exaltation among these\r\nhalf-human creatures, had I not easily detected the jealousy of the\r\nchief, which feeling Grin continued constantly to feed. Indeed in spite\r\nof all I could do, a division of parties was growing every day.\r\nUnfortunately the females were more fierce in their partisanship than\r\nwere the males. Moreover a majority of these “ladies” evinced a strong\r\ndesire to ally themselves to the side of which I was becoming the\r\nunwilling leader. Prominent among them was the chief’s albino mate, who\r\nwas far too persistent to give me any peace of mind. I foresaw trouble\r\nto come from this unhappy complication.\r\n\r\nHad all the Links united in considering myself a leader and governor of\r\nthe tribe, I should have enjoyed very much the “recognition of my\r\ntalents,” especially as such an outcome would have furthered the scheme\r\nI had, to make them fit as warriors and then persuade them to march as\r\nmy escort to the coast. Indeed I was planning and working deliberately\r\nto become commander-in-chief. But this division was not at all assuring,\r\nfor although all had a wholesome fear of the Tartar they had caught, yet\r\nany one of the creatures, turning treacherous, could have killed me\r\noutright with a single blow.\r\n\r\nI made no end of attempts to procure the confidence of the chief, and\r\nfrequently thought I was winning him over, but always Grin got in a\r\nstroke which set my endeavours at naught. I could have killed the beast\r\nwith great satisfaction to myself and with profit all around. The albino\r\nfemale I ignored pointedly at every opportunity afforded. This gave some\r\ndegree of satisfaction to the chief, but like Othello, he grew\r\ninsufferably suspicious.\r\n\r\nOur work of providing weapons and utensils, and also of securing a\r\nbetter state of existence and defence, proceeded daily. I worked like an\r\nengine, myself, to employ all my thoughts, which began to be\r\ndisquieting. Although I strove to avert what was slowly coming, the\r\nconviction was borne in upon me more and more that if things continued\r\nas they were going, I should either be obliged to fight a pitched\r\nbattle, backed by my voluntary adherents, against the chief and his\r\nparty, or else abandon my scheme of escape altogether.\r\n\r\nBut if I brought about the internecine strife and even won the battle,\r\nmy force would be utterly inadequate for an escort, (provided I could\r\nget them to leave the wilds to which they were all accustomed), for the\r\nwhole tribe did not muster half the number of fighters which the black\r\nLinks had assembled against us that day at the cave. If we started\r\nthrough the jungle, who should say we might not walk straightway into\r\nthe settlement of our hostile neighbours? Besides this natural enemy,\r\nthe woods were sure to be filled with ourang-outangs, snakes, tigers and\r\nno end of other animals that would snip off man after man, if they did\r\nnot annihilate the party entirely.\r\n\r\nThe situation was trying. If I discontinued the archery practice and the\r\nteaching of “civilized arts,” my Links would never be fit for my “army;”\r\nif, on the contrary, I proceeded to place the fellows on a fighting\r\nequality with myself, they would all be the worse as enemies, if ever a\r\ngenuine rebellion should occur. Having thought and thought till my brain\r\nwas weary, I decided to take my chances on having them understand the\r\nbow, trusting that something might happen which would make us all\r\nunited. I reasoned that if our foe, the Blacks, should swoop upon us\r\nagain, we might all be killed, if they found us unprepared, and then all\r\nschemes of escape would be equally vain.\r\n\r\nOur programme of armament therefore proceeded with all reasonable haste.\r\nWe had frequent practice with the weapons, many of the Links soon giving\r\npromise of great proficiency with this natural weapon of early man.\r\nDuring this time the strained relations were in no wise improved, thanks\r\nto the ceaseless efforts of Grin and to the idiocy of Madame Albino, who\r\nbecame the more zealous as I treated her with greater contempt. I grew\r\ndesperate, for matters were tending toward disruption too plainly for\r\nany concealment.\r\n\r\nOne morning I was drilling the Links in sham fighting, and making them\r\nform in hollow square about me. In the midst of our manœuvres I had an\r\ninspiration, totally foreign to the work. The lake! Why had I not\r\nfigured out before that the lake must have inlets and an outlet, and\r\nthat the latter must eventually reach the sea itself? True the thought\r\ncame quickly that out in that ever-anomalous Nevada there are lakes (or\r\n“sinks”), which have no outlet at all, but I doubted strongly if this\r\nlake belonged to that same peculiar species. By all means I would\r\nexplore it, come what might. I would know what it promised, and no\r\nmatter what manner of outlet I might discover, I would attempt my escape\r\non its bosom, and snap my fingers at Links and all of their ilk.\r\n\r\nFor this business I should require a boat. Perhaps this would be no\r\nbetter than a raft, in the end, if nothing better could be constructed,\r\nbut something floatable would be necessary before I could move a mile\r\ndown or about the sheet of water, for the jungle grew to the very edge\r\nof this shimmering gem, rendering its circum-exploration on the shore as\r\ngood as a physical impossibility.\r\n\r\nIt was easy enough to induce the Links to help me force a path to the\r\nwater’s edge, but I soon discovered that without exception they held the\r\nplace in awe and superstitious dread. It did prove to be generously\r\ninhabited, but this was quite to be expected. For the matter of that,\r\nthe whole country was crawling with deadly reptiles and brutes, so that\r\nchoosing the lesser evil was not too decidedly easy.\r\n\r\nOne would have said that material was plentiful, even had I contemplated\r\nbuilding a fleet, but the growth was so dense that I knew it would be a\r\ngigantic task to cut down any timber. The Links were anxious to leave\r\nthe shore for the safer hill, but I kept them with me and communicated\r\nto several the fact that I was searching for a log. This was an\r\nexcellent move, for Fatty soon underwent a paroxysm of delight at his\r\ncleverness, and at my open satisfaction, when he jerked away a snarl of\r\nvines, already concealing the trunk of a tree which apparently had\r\nsuccumbed to a violent gale.\r\n\r\nWe soon had the log laid bare for more than twenty feet of its length.\r\nIt was twined about by creepers, but it had no low branches to give us\r\ntrouble, while its size was entirely satisfactory. With our tools of\r\nflint we started to cut the thing off in two places, the root end being\r\nin no wise fit to form the prow or the stern of a boat, but our efforts\r\nseemed so feeble and childish that apparently it was next to an\r\ninsurmountable difficulty to perform even this primary office. I felt so\r\ndiscouraged that I nearly gave it up then and there.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of my admirers was willing to run to camp for a brand of\r\nfire, for I had resolved to burn the log in two. This was a task which\r\nopened up large possibilities for the expenditure of time and patience,\r\nalthough we constantly removed the fire, as soon as its flames had eaten\r\ninward, charring the wood, when we chopped away this softened portion\r\nand began again. At the end of the first day we had accomplished so\r\nlittle that the task, merely of getting the log cut off, seemed\r\nhopeless. I determined that if we did get the log free at last I would\r\nhave it rolled into the water and content myself with its plain,\r\nunvarnished bulk for a craft, for digging it out to form a boat I feared\r\nwould be more of a job than my patience could endure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n                         TREACHERY AND A BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe labour at the lake-shore, day after day, somewhat reduced the\r\nparty-feeling brewing between the chief and our respective followers. He\r\nwas with us often, but quite as frequently went hunting in the jungle at\r\nthe head of a dozen fighters.\r\n\r\nOur practice with the bows had proceeded so well that we bagged a good\r\ndeal of our game with the weapons, squirrels, various birds and hogs\r\nproving to be the most abundant and easy victims. Of the skin of one of\r\nthe hogs so secured, I made myself a clumsy sort of quiver, which held\r\nmy arrows to perfection. Of another I fashioned some thick but\r\nserviceable leggings, which afforded me a much-needed protection.\r\n\r\nWhat with sundry interruptions, for needed labours about the camp, it\r\nwas more than a week before we finally completed the burning and hacking\r\noff of the log by the lake. Then we began to roll it and push it toward\r\nthe water, a task requiring more patience than ingenuity, for we had an\r\nabundance of muscle although I found it not always easy to direct this\r\ncrude force to the best advantage. I set my fellows to work getting out\r\nrollers, so that if necessary, later on, I could use a lever and get the\r\nlog in the water alone.\r\n\r\nHaving brought it near the edge, I was tempted to proceed with my\r\noriginal plan of digging it out to form a canoe, trusting that the\r\ntrouble which threatened between our divided forces would merely\r\nsmoulder, at the worst, for a time and that before it broke out\r\ndangerously I might be better prepared to make my explorations and my\r\nattempt to escape. Deciding to try this plan, I had the log lifted up on\r\ntwo rocks, one under each end, after which I had my Links dig me a\r\nquantity of stiff red clay, which we worked up with water and plastered\r\nthickly over the sides and ends of the log, leaving a wide place\r\nuncovered on the under side. We then made fire all along underneath, and\r\nby constantly digging away the portions that were charred, and then by\r\nburning and digging again, we made considerable progress with the work.\r\nThe clay, of course, protected the parts of the boat so covered from\r\nbeing consumed. By plastering more of the clay inside of the sides and\r\nends, as soon as the boat began to be hollowed out, we protected them\r\nalso, and thereby directed the flames in such a manner that they burned\r\ndeeper into the wood all the time, without endangering the portions\r\nwhich I desired to leave stout and thick.\r\n\r\nIt was hot work and hard, to get in under that boat and dig out ash and\r\ncharcoal, but several of my loyal workers conceived a tireless\r\nenthusiasm for the task, although none could have guessed what I was\r\nfashioning, to save his life. Their industry and tractability reminded\r\nme always of the faithful work which dogs will perform for a master.\r\nWhile the burning-out was being done, I hacked and worked away to make\r\nthe bow and stern of the craft a bit more shapely than they were after\r\nour crude log-cutting process. Also I formed a clumsy keel, of straight,\r\nslender saplings, which we fastened firmly in place by boring several\r\nholes straight through them and then hammering plugs into these and into\r\ncorresponding holes made, at the cost of infinite pains, along what\r\nwould be the bottom of the boat when we turned her over for launching.\r\n\r\nThis keel was finally finished, and by that time all along underneath we\r\nhad burned and dug away a foot in depth of the wood, which meant that\r\nafter the log—which was about three feet in diameter—was squared off to\r\nform the open top of the hull, the inside hollowing-out was only three\r\nor four inches deep, and we had still to dig it out fully eighteen\r\ninches more. Altogether I began to feel no little amount of pride in the\r\ngeneral appearance and promise of the craft, hence I worked at it with\r\nfeverish impetuosity.\r\n\r\nMy affairs were still at this stage when, one afternoon, I headed a\r\nlarge party of the Links on a hunt in the jungle to the east of the\r\ncamp. It was a sultry day, peculiarly still, for we nearly always had a\r\ncooling breeze. Doubtless our usual quarry had crawled away to various\r\nplaces of concealment. Certainly we found nothing stirring, and after we\r\nhad tramped unavailingly for more than an hour, I fancied I detected\r\nsigns of uneasiness among our fellows.\r\n\r\nThe chief was along, closely followed by Grin, whose malicious face\r\nseemed particularly wicked in the shadows of the forest. When a cloud\r\nrolled sullenly across the face of the sun, the Links came to a halt, as\r\nif undecided what to do. The chief gave a sign and uttered a word\r\nconveying his intention of returning to the camp. At that moment we\r\nstarted a hog from his wallow near a small marsh, and calling out\r\neagerly to all to follow and surround the animal, I darted ahead, bow in\r\nhand, excited by the prospect of a shot. My enthusiasm carried the main\r\nbody of the Links, who joined me readily enough.\r\n\r\nI noted as I went that the chief brought up the rear, in a sulky mood,\r\nwhile the fawning Grin pointed a finger at myself and laughed in a\r\nmanner fit to make a fiend of a saint, such ridicule did he heap upon\r\nall who would suffer themselves to be led by this power-usurping\r\nstranger.\r\n\r\nThe hog eluded our vigilance completely. We arrived at the base of a\r\nmass of rock which towered up like a heap of ruined masonry. Thinking I\r\ncould command a wider view from its top, while my fellows thrashed the\r\nundergrowth about its neighbourhood, to drive the hog from cover, I\r\nclimbed laboriously up, intent on having a shot if possible.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was I fairly on the peak and moving about to get in sight of\r\nall the Links below, than I noted Grin come dashing out of a jungle,\r\nmaking a noise for all the world like the trumpeting of an elephant.\r\nUndoubtedly this sound must have been their name for the huge pachyderm,\r\nand it was equally certain that the cry was a warning which inspired the\r\ngreatest terror, for without delaying a second for anything, the whole\r\nforce ran madly away from the place, back along the way we had come.\r\n\r\nI bawled out lustily, to halt them, and then to try to make them wait,\r\nbut again Grin sounded the startling trumpet and not a Link—not even\r\nFatty—turned or paused for all my shouting. I scrambled along the rocks\r\nto descend as rapidly as possible. It was not an easy task to regain the\r\nlower level; I was occupied several minutes by the task. I fell the last\r\nfive feet and the vines wherein I landed held me back a time which\r\nbecame exasperatingly long.\r\n\r\nAt length I started away in pursuit of my friends, but not a sign of one\r\ncould I see, not a sound of one could I hear. Soon I began to doubt if I\r\nwere on their trail. However, I felt that I knew my way as well without\r\nas with them, and therefore made what speed I could to overtake the\r\nband.\r\n\r\nPresently I paused to see if they had gone through the vines in the path\r\nI was attempting to follow. A low sound came from the distance; with\r\namazing suddenness the forest began to grow dark and oppressive. I\r\nfancied for a second the sound was made by the elephant. This theory was\r\nabandoned a moment later, for an echo of the rumble proclaimed the noise\r\nas thunder. Like a flash, the thought came in my brain that there was no\r\nelephant—that Grin had purposely given his cry, knowing well what a\r\nterror and consequent flight would ensue, with the deliberate purpose of\r\nleaving me abandoned in the jungle. I remembered the uneasy feeling\r\nwhich had been manifested by all the Links; they had doubtless been\r\naware that a storm was approaching.\r\n\r\nIntent upon defeating this scheme of treachery, and reviling the whole\r\nLink nation for cowards of the most consummate type, I stumbled on,\r\nthrough the gathering gloom and through the vines that tripped my feet,\r\ngrowing a trifle anxious about the approaching shower.\r\n\r\nAlmost before I had gone a hundred yards, the sky was a sea of tempest\r\nand driving clouds of the blackest hue. Gusts of heavy, hot wind shook\r\nthe tops of the trees and crashed through the creepers, swaying them\r\nroughly where they hung. The darkness of night descended like a mist of\r\nink. I floundered forward and fell. A flash of lightning and a crash of\r\nthunder seemed to rip the very firmament in twain. I was blinded and\r\nutterly confused. I ran ahead, only to find myself confronted by an\r\nimpenetrable fabric of vines and creepers. This I strove to go around,\r\nbut it seemed to hedge me nearly all about. In desperation I hastened\r\nthrough the only opening I could find. This appeared to lead me into a\r\ntrail, along which I ran.\r\n\r\nAgain a brain-scorching glare of lightning threw everything into weird\r\nrelief, the trees like living creatures which struggled in the mesh of\r\ncreepers, writhing like snakes, in the bluster of wind. Then a lesser\r\nillumination, when I had torn my way along for some distance, cut out of\r\nthe ebon depths the great mass of rock I had climbed such a short time\r\nbefore. I reeled backward—it seemed preposterous—some enormity of\r\nfate—it could not mean that I was lost—no, no—I would turn about—I knew\r\nthe way—I should reach the camp in an hour. What a child I was to be so\r\nconfused and alarmed by a storm!\r\n\r\nAgain I started. The flashes and the deafening peals of thunder\r\nincreased. In five more minutes I stood still, confused, for the\r\nfearsome play of lightning illuminated the jungle clearly and it looked\r\nall wrong—all unfamiliar about me—and all deadly thick. I must hasten\r\nback to the pile of rocks, I thought, in a sort of despair. I could wait\r\nthere—wait till the storm had passed, and then, when the sky became\r\nclear again of clouds, I could easily find my way to the camp.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen minutes I fought my way through the vines and plants. The\r\nflashes were more intense, and nearer than before, but of rocks or of\r\nanything familiar I saw not so much as a shadow.\r\n\r\n“I’m lost!” I cried at last, “I’m lost!”\r\n\r\nThe confession burst from my lips as if to mock me. The stupendous\r\nmeaning of the truth burst in upon me ruthlessly. I was lost—alone in\r\nthis terrible jungle and night coming on apace! Every horror of my night\r\nin the tree, above that ghastly banquet of the tiger, came vividly back.\r\nEvery thought of the snakes and the prowling beasts, in search of blood\r\nand meat, seemed to burn deeper into my brain with the blinding shimmer\r\nof lightning. I fled in one direction, then in another—then anywhere, at\r\nrandom.\r\n\r\nIt was foolish and weak to race hither and yon as I did in my\r\nsemi-madness, but the dark jungle created an unspeakable dread in my\r\nbrain; its terrors were magnified by my contemplation of one danger\r\nafter another. I foresaw nothing but a dreadful death, which might come\r\nsoon or late. To find the camp of my Links I felt would be quite\r\nimpossible, for I knew absolutely nothing, by this, of one direction\r\nfrom another.\r\n\r\nWildly and thoughtlessly I kept on going. A crash of thunder now split\r\nopen the clouds and let down a deluge of rain. It made no difference to\r\nme, any more than did the darkness. But while I was pushing senselessly\r\nahead, I slipped on a patch of wetted clay and slid to an unseen edge,\r\nover which I shot, going down below like a sack of bolts. I struck on my\r\nfeet, landing on something half soft. Instantly a furious growl of pain\r\nand rage made me leap away forward. A brilliant dance of lightning made\r\nthe spot as bright as day—and I beheld two hideous ourang-outangs, which\r\nhad just been in the act of crawling into a cave, and on the legs of one\r\nof which I had landed. They came quickly toward me, in a frenzy of\r\nanger.\r\n\r\nI dashed away, along a well-beaten path that was made through the\r\ngrowth, the two brutes hotly pursuing. The darkness that followed the\r\nglare of light was of only a second’s duration, so continuous had the\r\nelectric display in the heavens become. The beasts were gaining upon me.\r\nAcross a leaf-hidden log I pitched headlong. The ourangs were nearly\r\nupon me when I sprang again to my feet and raced away. Still they\r\ngained; and the noises they made chilled the blood in my veins, so\r\ndiabolical was the sound. My breath grew short, my bow, which I had\r\ncontinued to hold in my hand, got caught for a second, yet I dared not\r\nlet it drop, though it caused me the greatest of trouble.\r\n\r\nBehind me now I could almost feel my infuriated foes. I dared to dart a\r\nglance across my shoulder. What a snap-shot picture it was, of awful\r\nforms—half erect and fearfully active,—a picture of monsters, suggestive\r\nof most inhuman humans, with fiery eyes, with hideous muzzles, massive,\r\nprognathous jaws,—with terrible open mouths which were filled with\r\ndrooling fangs, and with black, leather-and-iron hands, now on the\r\nground, now up and reaching, as if to clutch and drag me down!\r\n\r\nI knew they would certainly overtake me unless I could do something\r\ndesperate at once. I jerked out my knife—recently whetted on a stone. By\r\nthe continuously fluttering lightning-shimmer, I chose a spot, ahead,\r\nwhich was comparatively clear. Then while my flesh fairly crept for my\r\ndread of being reached, I slacked off my speed a trifle and let the\r\nnearest ourang gain a yard.\r\n\r\nSuddenly leaping aside, when I bounded to the selected clearing, I swung\r\naround with my arm extended, the knife gripped hard, and quickly aiming\r\nat the monster’s throat, stabbed him with all my might. So great was the\r\nimpact of the blow, increased by the brute’s momentum, that his head was\r\nnearly slashed from his body. I saw it lop limberly over on his\r\nshoulder. Then the larger brute behind struck the falling body and both\r\nwere toppled together in a heap.\r\n\r\nAgain like a madman I darted away. In a few seconds on came the now\r\ndoubly raging creature, behind. My breathing had become so painful that\r\nit seemed as if I could taste my own blood in my mouth. I dared not stop\r\nand I dared not attempt my trick a second time. A fearful note of wrath\r\nwas in the sound which the gaining monster now began to utter. I knew he\r\nwas sure he should catch me soon. Before me, abruptly, the growth was as\r\nthick as a hedge. I saw that I must change my course. Baffled, not\r\nknowing what else I could do, I pulled an arrow from my quiver and\r\nnotched it on my bow-string as I ran. Then stopping I turned, drew it\r\nquickly and let it drive point blank at my on-rushing foe. It flew too\r\nlow, for the string was wet and in no fit condition, and struck the\r\nbeast in the fleshy part of the thigh.\r\n\r\nEmitting a scream of agony, the brute snapped the shaft short off in the\r\nwound, with his hand. I took advantage of the opportunity, nearly winded\r\nas I was, and plunged desperately through a maze of vines. It caught me,\r\nbut I tore away a long wire-like creeper that dragged behind for twenty\r\nfeet. And the gnashing ourang, limping on an almost useless leg, came\r\nafter me, relentlessly. It seemed like a nightmare—endless, although,\r\nlike a terrible dream, it had not been of more than a few minutes\r\nduration from the start.\r\n\r\nMy bow-string had apparently stretched, and this effect I had increased\r\nwhen I shot; the weapon was therefore temporarily useless. Had I now\r\nbeen fresh, I believe I could have beaten the wounded brute in the race,\r\nbut I was ready to sink from exhaustion. He got nearer and nearer. What\r\nto do next was more than I could tell.\r\n\r\nPanting and fetching my breath by the most painful of efforts, I\r\nblundered heavily through a net-work of branches—and got my second\r\nsudden fall over a bank. This time I struck sitting down—in a stream of\r\nwater which, swollen by the rain, was a roaring torrent. It swept me\r\ndownward, gasping and battling to keep my head above the surface.\r\n\r\nThen with a splash the ourang-outang landed headlong in the flood. He\r\nalso came rolling and tumbling along with the turbulent volume of water.\r\nBut he clutched an overhanging limb and hauled himself out and up on the\r\nbank, as if he found the plunge exceedingly hateful. Whether he lost the\r\nscent, or whether he was convinced that I also had scrambled out of the\r\nstream, would be hard to determine. Busy as I was to keep from being\r\ndrowned, or dashed to death on the rocks, I yet had a flash of relief\r\nand thankfulness to find myself freed of the terrible pursuer.\r\n\r\nMy bow, to which I had clung with such a desperation, was lost from my\r\nhand when I fell into the torrent. As I righted myself, a trifle, on my\r\ndownward sweep, and tried to mark out a branch or a creeper to clutch, a\r\nterrific bolt of lightning struck a tree not a hundred feet below. As if\r\na thousand cannon had burst, the din and crash of thunder fairly stunned\r\nme for a second where I was. I got a mental photograph of the tree\r\nflying apart in monster splinters, as if a charge of dynamite had rended\r\nit asunder; and then followed a total annihilation of all light and a\r\ndownpour of rain which was simply overwhelming.\r\n\r\nI was bowled downward helplessly, tossed through a drag of vines that\r\nwere growing over the bed of the stream, and then, before I had half\r\ncollected my senses—scattered as they were by the stroke of lightning,—I\r\nwas shot through an agitated run-way and plunged below my depth in what\r\nI thought to be a large pool of water.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately, as I began to swim, on arising to the surface, I\r\npushed against a great piece of timber on the top of which I climbed\r\nwithout a moment’s hesitation. Then came a flicker of lightning a mile\r\naway, illuminating all the scene, when I discovered that I was crouching\r\non a large section of the very tree which the fearful lightning blast\r\nhad shattered, and which was floating on the surface of the sheet of\r\nwater which I had previously dubbed “My Lake.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n                            SAURIANS AS FOES\r\n\r\n\r\nAs if the culmination of the electric discharge in that particular\r\nquarter had come with the bolt which struck so near myself, there was\r\nalmost a complete cessation of pyrotechnics which would have been\r\nvisible from the rain-pelted lake. Distant thunder grumbled incessantly,\r\nbut the gloom which descended over water and jungle was only rendered\r\nmore intense by the fitful glow of light which trembled upward so far\r\naway.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as my log was steady, I sat down as comfortably as possible.\r\nSoaked through as I was, I paid no attention to the drenching shower\r\nwhich continued. It was warm enough, and while it could hardly be\r\npleasant, when thus continued such a time, I felt as if it were less\r\nthan trifling, after all I had recently undergone. Naturally enough the\r\nshore had no immediate attractions which would tend to make me wish to\r\npaddle in. From the sound of my stream, tumbling noisily into the lake,\r\nI concluded the log could not be drifting to any considerable extent. I\r\nwould wait for the light to come before I moved.\r\n\r\nOne usually feels entitled to suppose that a thunder-shower is fleeting,\r\nhere one minute and gone the next, but I was in for a disappointment.\r\nThough the wind had ceased to blow, the lowering clouds continued rank\r\nwith rain and apparently as dense as lead. The darkness of the storm\r\ncontinued till the margin between day and night was passed. I realised\r\nat last that there would be no light till dawn.\r\n\r\n“What shall I do?” I muttered aloud, but I knew as I spoke that I would\r\nsit all night on that floating log, wet, somewhat chilled and ravenously\r\nhungry, to say no word of being alone and lost.\r\n\r\nThe prospect was not exactly bright, but I felt so grateful for my\r\nmiraculous escape, and so much more content to be on the water than\r\nalone again for a night in the jungle, that I entertained no fears for\r\npresent or future. I tried to think of any duties I owed to myself,\r\nwhich I ought in reason to perform, and then the obvious impossibility\r\nof doing anything at all made me smile.\r\n\r\nIt was still early evening when the rain ceased to fall. I laid out full\r\nlength on the log, to see if I thought it safe as a position in which to\r\nsleep. It served to ease my joints directly, though I found it as a bed\r\nrather hard and lumpy. Sleep being about the last thing possible, I\r\nremained on my side, gazing absently at nothing, engaged in reviewing my\r\nown mental panorama of events. From time to time I dabbled my hand in\r\nthe water, as I always had done when in a boat as a child. I was not so\r\npeaceful as this apparent mood of dalliance might imply, for my brain\r\nwas painfully alert, both on the things already done since my memorable\r\nballooning trip with Ford, and concerning what would happen on the\r\nmorrow and the days, weeks and months to come.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this business something gently “nosed” my fingers in the\r\nwater. I jerked them away quickly enough to have startled anything alive\r\nout of all its wits, but nothing dived or swam away in alarm, so that\r\nafter a minute I put my hand downward again and felt it come in contact\r\nwith something which was touching against the log. Exultantly then I\r\ngrasped this something and pulled it aboard.\r\n\r\nIt was simply my bow, which had floated down the stream, when I lost it\r\nby striking in the water, and which had drifted in the only current\r\nthere was. In this current, of course, the log was also drifting, hence\r\nthe coming together.\r\n\r\nA feeling as if an old comrade had rejoined me made me joyous, as I held\r\nthe weapon up to let it drip. Its return to my hand made me think of and\r\nfeel for the arrows. Five were still in my quiver, and having been\r\nprotected as they hung on my back, they were as good as ever, except for\r\nthe wetness of the feathers. The string of the bow was flabby and\r\nuseless. I held this friend in my hand for more than an hour, rubbing\r\nthe wood with my palm till it felt as dry as an idol in a temple.\r\n\r\nThe night advanced. I sat down, lay down and then got up on my feet a\r\ndozen times. Once I fancied the log was drifting in toward the shore.\r\nWith my hands I paddled it slowly away. The stars shone brilliantly at\r\nlast, for the final cloud had disappeared from the sky. From the jungle\r\nissued sounds in plenty, repetitions of what I had heard before, but I\r\nthought myself secure and tried to catch a bit of sleep.\r\n\r\nA night more long than that one on the lake I have never passed. It was\r\nmade more interminable by the five-minute slumbers which came to my\r\nsenses after midnight. I grew uncomfortably chilly. Two things happened\r\nbefore the morning finally dawned. The first was that weary nature\r\nasserted herself and I became lost in dreams of that horrible pair of\r\nourang-outangs; the second was that a breeze sprang up and drifted my\r\nlog where it listed.\r\n\r\nI awoke with a start, for something struck the log such a blow that it\r\nlurched heavily and all but pitched me end-ways in the water. I sprang\r\nup, on my tossing craft, beholding myself less than quarter of a mile\r\nfrom the nearest shore and surrounded by the rings of a great ripple\r\nwhich something had evidently caused on the lake’s surface.\r\n\r\nIt was morning and already warm. My bow string was not only dry, but it\r\nhad shrunk to nearly its old condition. The stream of water down which I\r\nhad tumbled was neither in sight nor hearing. I began slowly to realise\r\nthe truth; I had drifted almost entirely across the lake. I scanned the\r\nscenery on every side. There were jungle-covered hills in front, the\r\nsame, but more distant, behind me, and again the same toward the North,\r\nwhere the shore was two miles away. To the South I saw familiar slopes\r\nand features of the mountains. This meant that I was looking on the lake\r\nas I had when at work on the boat. Plainly my boat and “home” then, were\r\nnorthward a goodly distance.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, while I was looking about, the maker of all the recent\r\ndisturbance appeared—an alligator. He was not very large, but black,\r\nhideous and actively concerned about the log. He must have overlooked me\r\nentirely to have struck such a blow, and then doubtless he had dived for\r\nsafety. Now as he jutted up darkly, dividing the waters which rolled off\r\nhis revolting head, his two little eyes gleamed with a look which made\r\nme think of my weapons in a hurry.\r\n\r\nHe came toward me cautiously, circling slowly about. There was nothing\r\nto do but to get an arrow in readiness, and then to wait, but I\r\nshuddered to think of a fight with such a powerful monster. The\r\ncreature, I am convinced, thought me a larger one of the monkeys on\r\nwhich his kind were fond of dining. He presently headed straight for the\r\nlog. Knowing he would dive in a moment I shot at him quickly. The arrow\r\nstruck him just beneath the eye. It broke and glanced from the tough wet\r\nskin, but a splinter actually struck in his eye-ball and ruined his\r\nsight on that side of his head. He sank like a thing of iron. A second\r\nlater the end of the log went heaving up and I was thrown violently off\r\ninto the lake.\r\n\r\nThe log came down with a force that beat up a fountain of spray. I was\r\nstruck on the foot by the half-blinded reptile as I struggled to get\r\nback to my place and out of his way. He began furiously to lash the\r\nwater as he rammed about in a circle. Rising to the surface like a small\r\nliving island, he turned upon me again and came ahead with all his\r\nspeed, making me think of a deadly torpedo.\r\n\r\nThere was no time for arrow or bow, and the latter was gone again in the\r\nbargain, but it took me only half a second to rip out that ever-needed\r\nknife. Over we went, more abruptly than before, the water churning and\r\nboiling up in foam about my ears. He had calculated poorly and now he\r\nclosed his awful jaws upon the jagged end of the log, not a foot from my\r\nshoulder. I jabbed at him frantically—stabbing at his other eye which\r\nsuddenly popped fairly out of its socket as I pried and gouged with the\r\nend of the blade.\r\n\r\nThe beast raised a snorting noise at this, which made me ill with fear.\r\nWith the power of a whale and the ferocity of a shark he whipped the\r\nwater into froth and snapped his jaws in every direction. He was head\r\non, side on and tail on, alternately, feeling for me and grinding pieces\r\nout of the log whenever he found it. He clawed me once and knocked me\r\nclean over the log with his tail a moment later. I stabbed at him\r\nwildly, but with no effect, a dozen times. I was nearly drowned and the\r\ncreature seemed to be everywhere at once.\r\n\r\nHad he been able to see me, my life could not have been saved by any\r\nchance, in such a whirlpool of wrathful attacking. I was nearly blinded\r\nby the spray which flew from the waves. The log, which was pitching\r\nmadly, with a force only second to the creature’s own, arose abruptly\r\nfrom a plunge and, like a lever, pried the alligator fairly over on his\r\nback and threw me almost upon him.\r\n\r\nI stabbed him twice in the belly, the last blow tearing a deep, wide\r\nhole, as he rolled to right himself, and then to my great astonishment\r\nhe dived like a porpoise. I lost not a second in getting on top of the\r\nlog. But the water grew calm and a deep red dye came floating up, to\r\nweave a strange device in the ripples.\r\n\r\nBreathlessly I waited, for a time that seemed endless. Cautiously I drew\r\nin my bow, which was floating near. At last there came a small commotion\r\nfifteen feet away. The alligator rose, fought a second with the foe\r\nwhich is Death, and sank again from sight. I believed then that my knife\r\nhad reached his heart.\r\n\r\nUp to this moment I had taken not so much as a glance toward the shore.\r\nI did so now and discovered myself to be something like fifty yards off.\r\nThe breeze had drifted me rapidly while the fight was being waged.\r\nLooking hurriedly about, I saw a rude sort of path, leading into the\r\njungle from the shore, made through the growth, which all along was so\r\nthick that I could see no beach in either direction. At the same moment\r\nI beheld another huge alligator some distance away, up toward a jutting\r\npoint of land.\r\n\r\nIt took me about an instant to decide that I had experienced all the\r\nalligator tactics I needed. Quietly pushing my bow downward, to sound\r\nthe water’s depth, I was surprised and glad to have it strike bottom at\r\nthree feet only. Using it then to pole myself and the log forward, I\r\nheaded for the trail on shore.\r\n\r\nThe alligator saw me before I had gone ten feet. He started, full steam\r\nahead, to overhaul my craft. I worked like a maniac; the monster was\r\nclosing up the gap between us with alarming rapidity. My raft was heavy\r\nand deep in the water. Nearer, nearer I drew to the shore, and terribly\r\nnearer came the fierce and hungry saurian.\r\n\r\nI had twenty yards, fifteen, ten to make; the creature was hardly more\r\nthan five away. In a second he would strike the log. Leaping madly into\r\nthe water I dashed to the bank and bounded up a slippery way, less than\r\nsix good feet from the creature’s snout.\r\n\r\nKnowing I could beat him on the land, I dashed along full speed. Forty\r\nfeet up—Lord save me!—it seemed as if the woods were full of the\r\nmonsters, several of which moved sluggishly as they heard me coming.\r\nThese got no chance to be dangerous, for I ran the gauntlet between them\r\nalmost before they were awake. In five minutes more I was clear of the\r\nmarshy border of the lake and up on higher ground. Here a large tree,\r\ntwined in a thousand folds of the creepers, offered an easy retreat. I\r\nclimbed up among its branches and finding a natural seat, where my back\r\nwas supported by the extra growth, sat down, weak and winded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n                             THE ENEMY NEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nIn fifteen minutes after I settled myself in the tree, in a position of\r\ncomparative ease, I fell into a deep and dreamless slumber. I had not\r\nintended to give up in any such manner, but the warmth, the relief to my\r\nmind and my weariness, combined to send me off before I realised what I\r\nwas doing.\r\n\r\nIt might have been a noise and it could have been pangs of hunger that\r\nawakened me finally. The hour was certainly that of noon, if not later.\r\nI felt hazy in my notions; it required no little blinking to get the\r\nwebs from my eyes and brain. Then I heard voices. What was being said\r\nsounded to me like Link language.\r\n\r\nI nearly cried out, thinking some of the tribe were near at hand, but\r\nfortunately I was still too lazy and exhausted to make such an effort.\r\nThen a movement attracted my gaze and I saw several Links, sure enough.\r\n\r\nBut they were black!\r\n\r\nI was wide enough awake in a second. I crouched low and got a mass of\r\nleaves between these vengeful creatures and myself, for I knew it would\r\nbe death, or worse, if once they clapped eyes upon my form. Peering\r\nfurtively down, I saw that all of them were standing perfectly still,\r\njust as if they might have halted abruptly and remained in various poses\r\nof action. There were eight in all, every one of whom was looking\r\nintently at something across the little clearing.\r\n\r\nWithout moving my body I turned my head and discovered a small black\r\nbear, which was sleepily smelling about and moving through the grass and\r\ngiant ferns. Wondering if presently the Links would dart upon the\r\ninoffensive animal and beat it to death with their clubs, I looked them\r\nover carefully. Except that they stood erect, they did certainly look\r\nlike close relations of the savage ourangs. Their ears were large,\r\nforeheads low and receding, and jaws tremendously heavy and protuberant.\r\nTheir noses were flat and broad, while their eyes, like those of my\r\nfriendly Reds, were small, round, near together and nervously watchful.\r\nI was not at all gratified to see them here; I wondered if, being so\r\nnear, they had discovered our settlement on the hill. Our settlement!\r\nWould I ever get back to my barbarous company and that “city” again, I\r\nwondered.\r\n\r\nThe bear shuffled off, with the utmost indifference to anything which\r\nmight be near. Then I beheld those black Links, one of whom possessed\r\nthe club with the nugget of gold on the end, do precisely what I had\r\nseen my Reds do, the day we were driven into the cave. They crept up to\r\nthe tracks which bruin had left in the moist earth and kneeling, as if\r\nin adoration, each placed his forehead down where the bear had trod.\r\nPlainly the creature was held in great reverence and awe by all the\r\nfamily of Links, whatever their colour. This seemed to me a remarkable\r\nand wholly inexplicable thing.\r\n\r\nTwo of the fellows, I noted, had fruits and cocoa-nuts in their hands,\r\nhaving probably gathered them recently for the dinner of the party. They\r\nnow parleyed a moment in monosyllables, with the others, the result\r\nbeing that all of the food was deposited on the ground, doubtless with\r\nthe thought that the bear might return and be pleased to find something\r\nto eat. It was doubtless a primitive “sacred” offering. As silently as\r\nso many snakes, the fellows then withdrew, on the side just opposite to\r\nthat in which their adored one had disappeared. I heard their voices die\r\naway in the jungle.\r\n\r\nIn order to be sure that I incurred no risk, I waited for fully fifteen\r\nminutes. The forest was particularly still. Slipping quietly down from\r\nmy perch, at last, I possessed myself of those fruits in the twinkling\r\nof an eye, and devouring a part then and there, I ascended to my throne\r\nwith all I could carry, and finished a meal, the relish of which\r\nsurpasses all human imagination.\r\n\r\nWhen I had done at last and that craving, inward system was fully\r\ngratified, I heaved a big sigh of content and gazed off listlessly into\r\nthe ocean of endless verdure. A soft wind fanned lazily by; there was\r\nnothing to threaten my life; the tropics were at their loveliest. As\r\nnaturally as it comes to a tired animal, sleep again came creeping\r\nacross my senses. Without even moving into an easier position, I slept\r\naway the whole balmy afternoon.\r\n\r\nI waked at last and found it was night. How drowsy it was, how blissful\r\nto sleep and sleep. My brain was too dull to receive an impression of\r\nalarm at my being alone in the jungle; I felt that I did not care what\r\noccurred. If anything wished to come and eat me up, it was all right,\r\nbut I did wish they might not make me awake while the job was being\r\ndone. Howls, death-screams, roars of the prowlers—all made a lullaby\r\nthat soothed me more. I turned the other way about, heavily, and sank\r\nagain into slumber.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n                           ADORATION SCORNED\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing was fresher nor keener than I when again the sun touched the\r\ntips of the trees. Asleep one second as soundly as a hibernating\r\nsquirrel, I was as sharply awake the next as a ferret in a coop. I shook\r\nmyself and stretched.\r\n\r\n“Great Scott!” I exclaimed, “that was a nap!”\r\n\r\nSwinging down from my berth I ate of the food which was still on the\r\nground, where the bear had neglected it quite, and then taking my\r\nbearings as best I could, from memory of my imaginary map of the lake, I\r\nstruck off through the jungle for “home.”\r\n\r\nOf the hours which it took me to force my way between tangles and around\r\na marsh and over hills and down dales, to accomplish what I thought to\r\nbe something like two miles on an air line, I have anything but pleasant\r\nrecollections. That I met with many creatures, flocks of parrots and a\r\ntroop of apes and monkeys; that I recoiled from a path in which a huge\r\nboa-constrictor was gliding, and that I cursed my luck repeatedly for\r\never having landed in such a place, is all a matter of small account,\r\ncompared to the fact that I stood at last on a hill and saw our very\r\ncamp. I came to it then in less than one more hour of hottest work and\r\ntravel.\r\n\r\nAn excited yell announced my approach before I had walked ten feet on\r\nthe slope of our hill. If the Links had been enthusiastic on the morning\r\nafter my night with the tiger, they were crazy and flabbergasted all at\r\nonce on this occasion. The whole population came tumbling and running\r\ndown the slope. They were worse than a pack of great, rough dogs that\r\nnearly knock one endways with delight. They made me fairly wild, the\r\nidiotic things, for my patience was gone to the winds, after my struggle\r\nto win through the jungle, and besides, it was they who had plunged me\r\ninto all the trouble. I batted them off with rare satisfaction and\r\npunched a couple of heads in the bargain, but the fools were more\r\ntickled than ever, though I would wager that some of them smarted.\r\n\r\nThey fell all over one another as they crowded me up the hill, but my\r\ntemper rather rose than lowered, for I began to pile my accumulated\r\ngrievances up against them. I wanted the whole outfit to understand that\r\nI thought them cowards, for running from a noise, that day in the woods,\r\nand that I now owed nothing to any one in the tribe for my whole skin\r\nand presence once more in “My village.”\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived inside the walls I was made decidedly more angry to find\r\nthat Grin had stolen the tiger-skull off my shelter to fasten it up on\r\nthe one in which he slept at night, and also by the fact that every\r\nblessed arrow we owned had been shot away by the fellows, as a lot of\r\ninconsequent boys might have done, merely to see them fly and to meddle\r\nwith the bows. These bows, by the way, were strewn about on the ground\r\nwhere everyone kicked them carelessly and walked on them with utter\r\nunconcern.\r\n\r\nIt took me about one minute to exhibit a bit of temper that scared the\r\ncreatures so thoroughly that all but Fatty jumped smartly away and stood\r\nat a distance, eyeing me painfully, ready to fall dead, if such act\r\ncould calm me down. Fatty had hastily and exultantly jerked the tiger\r\nrelic off from Grin’s abode and fetched it over to mine, after which the\r\nold idiot clung to me patiently through rain of blows and kicks, content\r\nto receive any amount of punishment, but wholly unwilling to leave the\r\nregion of my feet. I believe he would have smiled affectionately up in\r\nmy face and refused to run away if I had raised my knife to kill him on\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\n“You Grin, there,” I snorted in my wrath, “if ever I catch you in\r\nanother of your beastly, treacherous tricks, I’ll rip you in two and\r\nbeat the pieces on a rock!”\r\n\r\nThe females, seeing in a moment that the fawner was the chief object of\r\nmy anger, and cordially hating the fellow in the bargain, pinched him\r\nand struck him and bit him on the shoulders till he was constrained to\r\nrun away to preserve his miserable hide. Had they killed him at once I\r\nconfess I should have been delighted to witness the deed.\r\n\r\nI moved about, with Fatty, in the fine large circle which the troubled\r\nbut respectful Links maintained, while I drank some water and ate up a\r\nmango which was left in one of the baskets. This was evidently taken as\r\na favourable sign, for immediately old and young, male and female made a\r\ngreat demonstration of procuring me anything and everything that Link or\r\nLink-governor could possibly desire to eat, in hopes of propitiating the\r\ndemon of temper which they readily comprehended was raging within me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n                          THE CHIEF IS PLEASED\r\n\r\n\r\nMy indignation having produced a wholesome effect, I decided not to be\r\nplacated readily by anything, and determined thereafter to maintain a\r\ncertain strictness which should compel a greater respect. It is not\r\nentirely a human characteristic for a creature to grow too familiar when\r\ntreated with easy-going indulgence, for I have often seen dogs and other\r\nanimals impose on good nature with manners almost insolent.\r\n\r\nFor several days I treated the Links somewhat harshly, requiring much\r\nwork on the boat and on more of the arrows. I encouraged also a species\r\nof fear which I found my conduct had created. It was high time, I knew,\r\nto dominate the creatures, unless I was willing that they should\r\ndominate me.\r\n\r\nThey were quick to see that I rarely even threatened physical violence,\r\nhowever, and this soon tended to give them a confidence about\r\napproaching my “sacred” person. I had been in hopes that my gruffness\r\nand show of impatience had so discouraged the albino female that she\r\nwould keep her distance, for she did exhibit a becoming timidity for a\r\ntime, but this gradually wore away. I was exceedingly annoyed to\r\nobserve, not only that her disquieting symptoms were returning, but also\r\nthat she manifested greater ardour than ever before. My efforts to\r\nappear disagreeable were producing an effect exactly the opposite of\r\nwhat I desired.\r\n\r\nThat trouble would be brewed again I felt was inevitable. The chief had\r\nsomewhat manifested a spirit of doubt and alarm, in common with the\r\nothers, when he found me aroused, but this he was daily attempting to\r\novercome. I could see that the fire of jealousy, especially in regard to\r\nthe manœuvres of his fickle and silly mate was getting more assertive.\r\nIt could only be a matter of time till his animal-rage would burst all\r\nbounds, and then—one or the other of us would get hurt, for I had early\r\ndecided that my life was quite as important as his, and I therefore\r\nwatched him narrowly, always.\r\n\r\nThe work on the boat and weapons was progressing, but I was all\r\nimpatience to make things ready for my contemplated flight. In the midst\r\nof this state of affairs, the albino increased her advances, by bolder\r\ndemonstrations. Exasperated beyond endurance, I seemed powerless to\r\nperform anything which should end the matter decisively. Upon coming\r\nfrom my shelter, one morning, after having been to the spring, I saw her\r\ndown the hill, adoring my tracks.\r\n\r\nShe was on “all fours,” worshipping, by placing her forehead on the\r\nground where I had stepped, just as Reds and Blacks had done to the\r\ntracks of the bear. She was obviously in a state of ecstasy which was\r\nmost insane. She had never before proceeded so far as this, to my\r\nknowledge. It made me boil with wrath. I should have liked to box her\r\nears smartly. How alert and “secret” she was in her unseemly behaviour\r\nwas demonstrated by the activity with which she made off when her chief\r\nappeared around the slope.\r\n\r\nTwo days later I was exceptionally provoked to find this female within a\r\nrod of my dug-out, indulging in more of this madness. Moreover she was\r\nbeing observed by the angry chief, although I was not aware of this at\r\nthe moment. So disgusted and desperate did I feel that I stepped quickly\r\nto a rock, whereon my tortoise basin was standing, filled with water in\r\nwhich I had washed, and grabbing it up I jumped toward her and dashed\r\nthe contents all over her head and body, while she was still upon the\r\nground, adoring.\r\n\r\nShe was simply wild. A wet cat could not begin to be half so surprised,\r\nindignant and outraged as her ladyship became, instantly. She leaped to\r\nher feet, gasping, dripping, shuddering at the contact of all that\r\nwater, her mouth wide open, her eyes afire with the light of sudden\r\nhatred and fury. Not even a “woman scorned” could have been so ready to\r\nshred my flesh from my bones. I thought for a second she would fly at my\r\nthroat, in her passion, and gouge out my eyes, but the fiendish laughter\r\nof the chief and of ten or a dozen other females—who, of course, had\r\nseen the whole performance—turned her attention. This derision, however,\r\nmade her face the more diabolical in its expressions of wrath.\r\n\r\nFortunately what the lady said to myself was wholly unintelligible, for\r\nI had mastered hardly as much as twenty of their “words” at the time.\r\nBut I was left no room for doubt that the language was as “burning” as\r\nit was impetuous. I laughed with the others; indeed the whole thing\r\nstruck me as being so comical that I was fairly doubled over with\r\nunrestrained merriment. This acted like oil on a blazing fire, and being\r\nno longer able to control herself at all, the drenched female dashed\r\nmadly off to the edge of the woods, to vent her rage as best she could.\r\nThe chief was immensely pleased.\r\n\r\nIn the immunity from the female’s attentions and the consequent jealousy\r\nof her mate which I now enjoyed, I drove the work with hearty zest. The\r\nboat was all but finished, yet it needed digging out at least two inches\r\nmore, and this I felt to be important, knowing how heavy was the log of\r\nwhich it was made. I had even fashioned a pair of oars, the blades of\r\nwhich were firmly lashed to the handles, but by then our tools of flint\r\nwere almost entirely useless. Many had been lost and all had been more\r\nor less broken. The work actually ceased for lack of these necessary\r\nimplements.\r\n\r\nI set my fellows to digging up the ground, in the hope of unearthing\r\nmore of the pebbles which furnished the flint. In the forest, where the\r\nsoil was damp, we found a white, efflorescent substance in great\r\nabundance, near the surface. This, from its peculiar taste and general\r\nappearance, I knew to be common saltpetre, doubtless of value to the\r\ncommercial world, but of no account to me when I wanted flint. We tried\r\nthe hillsides and various localities, but not one of the precious\r\nchalcedony pebbles could we find.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion occurred to me at once that we could go to the old camp\r\nand dig all we needed, but this presented difficulties which aroused my\r\nimpatience. I desired to get away before additional complications could\r\narise. As a matter of fact, I was watching Grin very closely for\r\nevidence of further duplicity, which I thoroughly expected to detect,\r\nsoon or late. If once I could find the outlet of the lake, I thought, I\r\nwould say good-bye to these half-animal beings without the slightest\r\npang of regret, for they grated on me daily, more and more.\r\n\r\nI determined to launch the boat as it was and begin my explorations.\r\nThis work we undertook one sultry morning. The clay which I had\r\nplastered over the surface of the wood, where I had wished to protect it\r\nfrom the fire, was baked hard. We broke it away in pieces, and when it\r\nwas off and the boat turned bottom downwards, I felt exceedingly proud\r\nof the work and gratified to find the craft in much better shape than I\r\nhad thought to be possible.\r\n\r\nIt was placed on the rollers, after no little amount of pulling and\r\nhauling, and we were all engrossed with the preparations to shove her\r\nacross the intervening beach to the water, when without the slightest\r\nwarning there was a sudden rush and yelling about us, and we were almost\r\ninstantly surrounded by a force of the savage black Links from the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n                          WAR WITH THE BLACKS\r\n\r\n\r\nWholly unprepared as we were for this attack, and with the only clubs we\r\nhad lying about in the grass, it seemed as if we should be overwhelmed\r\nin a moment and killed where we stood. My fellows, however, were not\r\nonly marvellously quick to regain their weapons, but they also set up a\r\nseries of cries which alarmed the camp on the moment.\r\n\r\nA score of fighters had been left in the settlement that morning, to\r\nprepare the skins of animals recently taken, and to point some arrows\r\nwith what flints we had remaining. These now came running down the hill,\r\nnot with the bows and arrows, as I had hoped they might, but with their\r\nusual weapons.\r\n\r\nBefore our reinforcements could arrive, the Blacks rushed in and killed\r\ntwo of my workers as if they had been a pair of helpless worms. We were\r\nin the midst of a mass of the black devils, about three to our one,\r\nmaking terrible sounds of triumphant yelling and snarling. Fortunately\r\nthe chief was with us, and now his great crystal club retaliated on one\r\nof the foremost enemies and cleared a space for a moment, while I\r\nhurriedly pushed my fellows back to back in hollow-square order, and\r\ntried to let them know we must move all we could toward our hill, as we\r\nfought.\r\n\r\nThe Blacks were fiercely impetuous—mad to wipe us out. They dashed upon\r\nus with total lack of order, and therefore we beat down many before they\r\nkilled one more of our number. Had my fellows not been used to obeying\r\nwhat I ordered, I could not have kept them formed together for a moment.\r\nIt was only this condition of semi-order which saved us from total\r\nannihilation, for our mad antagonists rushed the fray with most\r\ninconsequent violence and force.\r\n\r\nThere was singular din of blows—clubs on flesh and clubs on clubs,—cries\r\nof rage and agony and shouted words—both of Linkish and English. It was\r\na spectacle of wildest action, the quick, muscular Blacks, inconceivably\r\nsavage, dancing, leaping about and hurling themselves upon us, their\r\nclubs fairly flaying the air, their faces fiendish with animal ferocity,\r\nteeth revealed and eyes darting fire of hatred, while we were equally\r\nwrought up, vicious and thirsty for blood, smashing them down, waging\r\nwar of defense and war of vindictive aggression.\r\n\r\nThey were winning, crowding us too near together, beating our outside\r\nfighters to death and dragging them feet first into a melee of\r\ndescending clubs, when our mates descended on the rear of the ones\r\nbetween ourselves and camp, and broke the cordon completely. They\r\nscreamed with hideous delight as they bowled over a dozen of the foe,\r\nbut over-confidence would have cost us every life—and the Lord only\r\nknows what after results—had my comrades not understood and obeyed my\r\ncommands to fly, for we were still outnumbered by heavy odds. Pushing my\r\nRed fellows, guiding and endeavouring to retire them in order, I\r\nsuddenly saw a club coming straight for my neck. I dodged, but got a\r\nscrape along the scalp and a thud on the shoulder, when I drove home my\r\nknife for the first time during the fight, and ripped it out from a\r\nthree-cornered wound. Then we darted through the battered-down opening\r\nin the ring and ran as hard as we could drive for the camp.\r\n\r\nUp the hill we surged with the Blacks swarming up behind us. We had\r\ngained fifty yards, owing doubtless to our perfect familiarity with the\r\nground; nevertheless a pair of our wounded fell behind and were\r\novertaken and beaten to a pulp at once. Through the gate in our wall we\r\nscrambled, and then I got my bow in hand at last and flew about\r\nfrantically, shouting and urging my fellows to arm themselves with the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWhile only about twenty of us rushed back to the wall as archers, the\r\nforemost Blacks, outstripping their comrades, bounded through the\r\nopening, or over the wall, insane with the hoarded rage of former\r\ndefeats, and ignorant of what they should find. The chief had halted\r\njust inside, with two of his mightiest fighters. They smashed down Link\r\nafter Link that attempted to rush the gate. Then we with the bows\r\narrived on the scene. The black demons in solid phalanx stormed the wall\r\nand came climbing up over its top.\r\n\r\n“Now! Now!” I cried, “Shoot the pigs!”\r\n\r\nIt made me thrill to see those powerful fellows making crescents of the\r\nbows. My heart leaped exultantly to hear the twangs and to see the small\r\nbut deadly shower of arrows suddenly pierce the air and sink in the\r\nscabbards of flesh. The very first flight toppled five of the creatures\r\nendways.\r\n\r\n“Shoot! Pigs!” I shouted again, for these two words my Links\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\nMore came running to join us with the bows. We spread out in something\r\nof a line. The air became thick with the hurtling arrows. Some struck\r\nthe wall and some flew high, but we mowed down many a Black, dead or\r\nwounded, till the fierce attacking devils were appalled to see us and to\r\nsee this mysterious work of slaughter.\r\n\r\nThey halted; the back-bone of their mad impulse was broken; they could\r\nnot endure to advance in the face of fatalities about them, much less to\r\ncarry the place, over the bodies of their fellows. Yet they were still\r\nmore than we in numbers, and had they known of and adopted the bloody\r\ntactics which sacrifice many, in those heroic, irresistible charges by\r\nwhich men win a fearful battle, they would still have swept us off the\r\nhill to the forest beyond, for our meagre supply of arrows was nearly\r\nexhausted already.\r\n\r\nBelow the wall they rallied. The fellow who was armed with the\r\ngold-nugget club—which was dripping with gore—seemed to be in command.\r\nHe flourished his terrible weapon and fired the Blacks with courage\r\nanew. They came for us, hot and eager to even up the score.\r\n\r\nI saw the great ebon creature head their charge, and notching my last\r\nremaining arrow on my bowstring, I waited for him, in great excitement.\r\nThey paid no attention to the gate, but crying out madly, swarmed up\r\nover the wall again as if nothing on earth could check their career.\r\nThose of my fighters who still had arrows shot with vengeance in every\r\nvibrating muscle. The Black who led, presented a splendid target,\r\npresently, though he was moving quickly. I let the shaft drive straight\r\nfor his breast, but he was leaping downward at the second it arrived,\r\nand it struck him squarely in the top of the left shoulder, near the\r\nneck and just inside the collar-bone. It seemed for a second as if it\r\nhad gone in half its length, but beyond stumbling forward a trifle when\r\nhe landed, the fellow appeared to have received no harm.\r\n\r\nI heard a cry of despair go up from the Blacks when they saw their\r\nleader struck, but I gave no heed to anything, so intent had I become on\r\nwatching this active creature. I was so absorbed, indeed, that before I\r\nrealised what was occurring, the fellow had bounded near enough to swing\r\nhis club to slay me where I stood. Half falling backward to escape, I\r\nlost my footing. The club came swiftly through the air, my arm was\r\nknocked aside and the nugget thumped ponderously on my ribs and bowled\r\nme end over end.\r\n\r\nIt had all happened in a second. I was down and knew I was badly hurt\r\nbefore I could have winked. I thought the furious Black would rush upon\r\nme and batter in my head, for I could not have risen to save myself from\r\nanything. But the savage creature fell dead in his tracks for my arrow\r\nhad found his heart and he had died even as he struck that powerful\r\nblow. Had he not been fatally hit, his blow would have slain me\r\noutright.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, my fellows, having brought down three of the foe with\r\narrows, had grabbed up their clubs again to beat in the heads of the\r\nBlacks who dared jump down in the field of death. Seeing their chief as\r\nhe sank, without so much as the flicker of a movement, the remaining\r\nbesiegers gave a yell of dismay and fled in a panic.\r\n\r\nOur forces—savage and aggressive the moment the tables were\r\nturned—became the hunters instead of the hunted. They descended upon the\r\nflying Blacks, slaying all the wounded who hobbled in the rear of the\r\nwild retreat and all whom they overtook before the jungle received its\r\ndefeated children back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n                         HOME JOYS AND TROUBLES\r\n\r\n\r\nI must have swooned, for I knew no more of anything until I awoke, in a\r\ndazed condition, and found old Fatty bending down above me, while near\r\nat hand nearly all the beings of the tribe stood gazing on my prostrate\r\nform with expressions of grave concern.\r\n\r\nUpon trying to arise I was so shot through with pain in my side and\r\nchest, that I felt things go dizzy directly. Then after a little I\r\nattempted to move to a more comfortable position. This was accomplished\r\nonly at the cost of great agony. I found that my left arm was badly\r\ninjured while all the upper portion of my body seemed quivering with\r\npain. Never had I been so wounded in my life.\r\n\r\nI asked for water, for the Links were but little better than so many\r\nfaithful dogs, who could whine over my helpless carcass, but who had not\r\nthe slightest idea of what to do to relieve my suffering. Never had\r\nmuscular action caused me such pangs as I underwent upon trying to\r\nswallow. The thump I had received, slightly back of the region of the\r\nheart, had come so near to being my pass to the world beyond that I\r\nbelieve another volt of power in the blow would have done the work. As\r\nit was, I refrained from crying out only by exerting my utmost will,\r\nwhen the chief and Fatty carried me bodily and laid me down on the skins\r\nin my shelter.\r\n\r\nMy consciousness went again as soon as my body touched the couch; yet I\r\nrallied soon and attempted to nod my recognition as the chief came back\r\nagain, bearing the great gold-nugget club, which he leaned against the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nIt became manifest early that if I survived the shock to my system and\r\nthe fracture of at least one rib, which I felt sure had resulted from\r\nthe blow, it must be through sheer good luck, backed by a hardy\r\nconstitution, for of lotions, or bandages or skillful attendance there\r\ncould be absolutely none.\r\n\r\nThat night I experienced the most excruciating torture it has ever been\r\nmy lot to endure. Every beat of my heart was like the stab of a dagger,\r\nin feeling. Concussion, even that inflicted by a fist, has proved too\r\nmuch for the great throbbing organ of man full many a time. I thought of\r\nthis afterward, but during that first twenty-four hours, I was utterly\r\nincapable of doing anything except living through the ordeal of pain.\r\n\r\nAll through the day that followed I lay there, feverish, yet too badly\r\nhurt to move on my bed. I ate nothing and drank water only, in single\r\nswallows. Fatty remained at my side as a mother might have done. Fifty\r\ntimes that day he ran to the spring for the fresh, cool water, as that\r\nwhich stood about in a shell for half an hour became too warm to be fit\r\nto drink. After a time he licked one of my burning hands, timidly, as if\r\nuncertain of how this ministration would be received. It felt cool and\r\nnot at all disagreeable; I therefore made no motion to draw the member\r\naway. Presently the worried creature repeated the favour; and after he\r\nhad done this humble office for both hands and wrists, I felt so soothed\r\nand refreshed that I fell asleep at last, and got a natural rest.\r\n\r\nDay after day went by and I was still on my back, though I could see\r\nthat improvement continued steadily. It was fully a week before I was\r\nable to move without suffering agonies, and for some time after that the\r\npain in my ribs was exceedingly sharp. During all this time I was amply\r\nsupplied by Fatty with fruits and with abominably cooked meats, for the\r\nfemales were neglecting all my former instructions, concerning the fire\r\nand the roasting and boiling of game.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was able to sit up, propped against a rock, I worked a\r\nlittle every day at making arrows, and urged my most skillful assistants\r\nto do the same. These shafts could not be pointed, owing to our lack of\r\nflints, but we finished several hundred, as to all but the requisite\r\nheads. I was visited daily by all the tribe, except two individuals,\r\nGrin and the unforgiving Lady Albino. The little Links who had fled in\r\nuncertainty before, even up to the last, now began to make me more of a\r\nregular companion. They were near me, more or less, from dawn till dusk,\r\ncapering about, sitting in groups in the sunlight, to watch me with\r\never-nervous eyes, and rolling over one another in rough, good-natured\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nThe very smallest of these “children” were hairy little scamps most\r\nastoundingly like baby chimpanzees, except for their lighter colour. By\r\nthe hour I watched them at their play and listened to their funny little\r\nwords of talk. It was not an ordinary baby prattle, to be sure, but it\r\nmade me think that all babies are very much alike. Their chief amusement\r\nconsisted in making a noise, by striking any two objects together. The\r\nrarest things they did were crying and laughing.\r\n\r\nThere was one little chap who never rolled on his back with the others,\r\nnever made a noise and rarely spoke. He was the only one that looked in\r\nmy face with eyes that were human-like and steady. I fancied his quaint\r\nlittle face was wistful; it was certainly serious and therein widely\r\ndifferent from those of all his companions. This little creature\r\napproached me most timidly and yet with a certain persistency that\r\nfinally made me look about, in the morning, to see if he had come.\r\n\r\nFor several days he sat near my feet, over which, finally, he laid his\r\nlittle arm. Gradually then he worked nearer and nearer to my head, as I\r\nsat against the rock until at last he cuddled unobtrusively up against\r\nme and permitted my arm to close loosely about his little form.\r\nThereafter this was his one particular place. Hour after hour he would\r\nnestle close in this, his nook, turning his questioning eyes to mine,\r\nnow and again, and blinking as if he tried to think out the great\r\ninscrutable problem of what we are and why we came to partake of the\r\nmystery of life. How foolishly fond of this little creature I became, I\r\nshall not attempt to say.\r\n\r\nThis was a time of laziness for all the tribe. The Links were sun-lovers\r\nof the most ardent description. Secure on our hill, undriven by any\r\ntask-master, provided with food in plenty, they basked for hours, lying\r\nflat on the back, and played exaggerated pranks, sometimes in a languid\r\nspirit of ease and sometimes with the greatest activity of movement.\r\nThey appeared to know nothing of family ties, nor of sorrow for those\r\nwhom they had been obliged to bury. They had no remorse, nor “pricks of\r\nconscience” for any acts ever performed, nor did they seem to have\r\nconceived of anything superior to themselves, except in a purely\r\nphysical manner. Thus they realised nothing of an occult, spiritual\r\npower of control and nothing of mystery, either in life or death. They\r\ntherefore had not the slightest fundamental suggestion of a religion,\r\nand worshipped nothing and feared nothing, save that which they could\r\nsee and which they had discovered, in their animal capacity, to be\r\ndangerous to life or limb. They could be made to feel a certain sort of\r\nawe, but this was one slight degree only above that emotion which in an\r\nanimal would excite the expression “the creature is cowed.”\r\n\r\nI had ample opportunity to become acquainted with the various traits of\r\nmy friends, for I was something of an invalid for more than two weeks. I\r\ncame to the conclusion that the Links were keener than I in every\r\nnatural sense; that is, they could see things more quickly; they could\r\nhear that which escaped my duller ears; they could smell odours which\r\nfailed to convey themselves to me; and they could “feel” dangers by a\r\nsort of unknown sense, or instinct, of which I would always remain in\r\ncomplete ignorance. They were highly organised in the natural\r\nattributes; they were powerful and active above any animal of their size\r\nI have ever seen; but when thought of as humans, they ranked with\r\nchildren who just fail to clutch the ideas of older people and whose\r\nefforts in manufacturing are crude and worthless.\r\n\r\nWhen at last I began to walk about again, performing small labours, I\r\nstill had an occasional dart of pain through my side, which made a\r\nfeeling of illness spread all through my system. However, the weather\r\nwas beautiful, the food simple and wholesome and the work soon began to\r\nlimber me up.\r\n\r\nBefore I was quite myself again, I commenced to be exceedingly annoyed\r\nby the actions of Grin. Although I had been the recognised superior, if\r\nnot the governor, of the tribe at the moment when I laid low the chief\r\nof the Blacks and completed our victory, yet my wound and subsequent\r\nweakness had rendered nearly everything nugatory. Inasmuch as my\r\nnearness to death had robbed me of the power by which I kept the Links\r\nin awe, many had assumed an irreverent air which became positive\r\ninsolence on the part of the fawner.\r\n\r\nHaving allied himself with the resentful female albino, this creature\r\nwas never neglectful of an opportunity to perform some sneaking bit of\r\nmeanness. For a time I was too weak to resent these impositions, and\r\ntherefore the creature grew bolder in the liberties which he dared to\r\ntake. Thus my tiger skull had again disappeared, and I knew he had\r\nstolen it, although I had no means of proving the theft. One morning,\r\nhowever, I caught the scoundrel in the act of smashing my turtle-shell\r\nbasin with a rock. His reason for doing this was two-fold. First, it had\r\ncontained the water with which I had dampened the ardour of Madame\r\nAlbino, and second, it was regarded by all as something uncanny out of\r\nwhich I drew a certain power as I washed my face and hands—an operation\r\nof which none of the tribe was ever guilty. Grin may have thought to\r\ndeprive me of my source of strength.\r\n\r\nThis wanton destruction of my property made me exceedingly angry. Before\r\nhe could leave the scene of his labour I rushed up and gave him a kick\r\nwhich was decidedly swift. It assisted him to rise with great alacrity.\r\nHe turned with a snarl and threw himself upon me. A fight was on in less\r\nthan a second. I had feared this collision for several weeks. It had\r\ncome at a bad time for me, inasmuch as the creature was twice as strong\r\nas I, even when in my normal state, and now I was far from being\r\nrestored to my former condition.\r\n\r\nWe wrestled for a moment, the beast attempting to bite, scratch and\r\nchoke me and to bear me down to the ground. I threw him off for a moment\r\nand Fatty would have jumped him instantly—and killed him, no doubt, with\r\nhis club—had I not waved him off abruptly. I was gratified to know that\r\na friend was near, but I desired to show the Links, who assembled at\r\nonce, that I was master when it came to a battle. This decision nearly\r\ncost me my life, for the brute gave me a wrench that brought back\r\nagonies which were well nigh insupportable, while I was knocking his\r\nhideous head aside from an attempted bite at my cheek.\r\n\r\nFor a second I regretted that Fatty had not batted off his head, for I\r\nfelt as if I should drop from weakness. But when he dug his nails in my\r\narm the smart aroused such a rage that my strength came flooding upward,\r\nlike a gush of something hot in my blood. I had warded off many of his\r\nlunges and was waiting for an opening as if I had been engaged in\r\nboxing. The chance presented itself now. He was leaping toward me\r\nviciously when I “slugged” him with all my might, fairly in the pit of\r\nthe stomach. My fist actually seemed to sink into the fellow’s body. He\r\nwas lifted off his feet, but before he could fall I fetched him a\r\nright-hander under the chin that jolted his head backward abruptly.\r\n\r\nHe fell like an effigy, arms outstretched, so that the back of his skull\r\nwas the first thing to strike the ground. There he lay, limp as a snake\r\nand motionless as a stone, while a referee could have “counted him out”\r\nfor the next twenty minutes. A great howl of satisfaction greeted this\r\nperformance, which placed me again on my pedestal of incomprehensible\r\npower. The truth of the matter was, however, that I was ready to fall\r\nover, myself, so severe had been the strain and the injury done to my\r\nweakened frame. By the greatest of efforts I walked away and washed\r\nmyself at the spring.\r\n\r\nGrin, when at last he again assumed a perpendicular, was dizzy on his\r\nlegs, ill and altogether a sorrowful object. I knew his head was aching\r\nand that his stomach would be morbidly sensitive for several days. He\r\nwas hooted and picked upon also, having been utterly defeated, so that\r\nhe was glad to retire from active service, muttering no end of what I\r\nsupposed were threats and maledictions.\r\n\r\nI was of precious little account to myself, or to any of the tribe, that\r\nday, but on the morrow I was mending rapidly again, and beginning to\r\npick up various threads of the plans I had fashioned before our fateful\r\nday of battle with the Blacks.\r\n\r\nIt was long since anyone from the camp had visited the boat, but my\r\nthoughts had been there much of the time. I had feared, daily, another\r\ninvasion by the enemy, whom I knew to be revengeful and who now\r\nunderstood the nature of our fortifications and means of defense. This\r\nfeeling of alarm increased. Should they come, with a force still greater\r\nthan the last, and find us armed with blunt arrows only, our resistance\r\nwould be short indeed. I dared not contemplate undertaking my\r\nexploration of the lake, much less my escape, while we were possibly\r\nthreatened with another attack and while I was weaponless myself,\r\nexcepting for my trusty knife.\r\n\r\nBeing almost wholly fit again I determined to make an immediate\r\nexcursion to our old cave-camp for the purpose of securing a supply of\r\nchalcedony pebbles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n                       NEEDED MUNITIONS GATHERED\r\n\r\n\r\nMy preparations consisted merely of acquainting a score of the Links\r\nwith my desire and of selecting six of the most suitable of our baskets\r\nfor use in bringing the flints to our village. More of the fighters than\r\nI wanted were eager to be of the party, but I deemed it advisable to\r\nleave a number at home with the females and children.\r\n\r\nWe got an early start and headed in what I had calculated to be the\r\nright direction. In this calculation I had been guided solely by my\r\nmemory of our camp and its position, relatively to the lake, as seen\r\nthat day from the top of the old volcanic peak. Pushing ahead as rapidly\r\nas possible, and spending no time on the game which we naturally\r\nencountered in the jungle, we traversed several miles without coming\r\nupon anything with which my friends were familiar, so that I soon gave\r\nup hoping that they would be of much assistance in finding the former\r\ndwelling place. From what I knew of them now, I was convinced that none\r\never proceeded far from camp in any direction. Their longest marches\r\nwere accomplished when they felt obliged to abandon a settlement, and I\r\nbelieve that even then they rarely travelled more than five or six miles\r\nat the furthest.\r\n\r\nAfter another hour of pushing along we emerged from the forest into a\r\nsmall, low valley which was nearly all a swamp and at the head of which\r\nwas a mountain of considerable height. This place discouraged me deeply\r\nfor I had believed I should really discover some guiding landmark, on\r\nclearing the woods. That we had gone somewhat in the wrong direction\r\nthere could be no doubt, for I was sure we had travelled far enough, by\r\nthis, to have passed the old cave, had it been on our line of march.\r\n\r\nThe day was excessively hot and I was weary and sleepy, being still a\r\nbit soft after my troubles, but I was annoyed at the thought of being\r\nbaffled. I determined to climb the mountain, for the sake of the\r\nenlarged prospect to be had from its summit, and therefore we toiled up,\r\nslowly, through a dense growth that covered the lower part of the slope.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching the summit, I gave a cry of delight. I had recognised the\r\nelevation as being the very same volcanic peak which Fatty and I had\r\nascended together, and which the party of us now had approached from the\r\nopposite side. This gave me my bearings at once. I could all but see the\r\nold camp below, when we had crossed the ancient, filled-in crater. I\r\npointed out the lake, and I made out the true direction of our fortified\r\nsettlement far away on its miniature hill. We started down in a hurry,\r\nfor even the Links knew the way after this. I might have thought of\r\nnothing but the flints we were after had I not fairly stumbled against\r\nthe out-jutting ledge of sulphur which I had discovered on the previous\r\nvisit.\r\n\r\n“Why here,” I said aloud, unthinkingly, “I believe I’ll take a load of\r\nthis to camp. By jingo, boys, I’ll make a lot of gunpowder!”\r\n\r\nSulphur here, saltpetre at home, charcoal to be had for the burning, my\r\nthoughts ran like lightning over the possibilities thrust into my\r\nunwitting hand. Powder? To be sure I could make powder! I would make a\r\nton of it—all we wanted and more! I would provide myself with a keg or\r\ntwo and take it along with me when I left in my boat to escape. But how\r\nI would use it, what I could do with the dangerous stuff, when once I\r\nhad it—having no guns and no cannon—this was more than I could tell.\r\nIndeed this part of the proposition floored me at once, but with a ready\r\nrefuge in postponing the working out of this trifling problem, I\r\ndismissed it from my brain completely and had my fellows assist me in\r\nbreaking off enough of the purest of the mineral to fill two baskets\r\nheaping full.\r\n\r\nTwo Links were required to each basket, when it came to bearing this\r\ncargo away, but I meditated that some wholesome labour was precisely\r\nwhat they needed. We reached the old camp shortly. There were the rocks\r\nthrown up to cover the mouth of the cave, which had threatened to be our\r\ntomb, but the grass and ferns had overgrown the spot and much of the\r\nrock heaps, to such an extent that no one could have guessed that a camp\r\nor a fire had ever been located in or about the clearing.\r\n\r\nThe ravine, where the tribe had buried its dead, presented its former\r\nappearance. We set to work without delay and in less than thirty minutes\r\nthe pebbles were accumulating with gratifying rapidity. I was careful to\r\nselect the ones best suited to our sundry requirements. Those in some of\r\nthe baskets I covered with soil, in order to keep their moisture from\r\ndeparting before we should have the time necessary to split them and\r\nchip out the arrow-heads, axes and knives.\r\n\r\nIt was something of a giant task to convey our baskets away, when I\r\nfinally had them loaded to my satisfaction, but the Links were\r\ntremendously strong, and all were willing to make the greatest possible\r\nexertion, that day, to gratify my wishes. We ate a lunch of fruits and\r\nsome cold meat which I had carried along, after which we made a\r\n“bee-line” for home. But I fear that any self-respecting bee would have\r\nbeen much ashamed of such a line as ours became before we issued forth\r\nfrom the trees, at last, in sight of the hill.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived, a great surprise was in store for all. Grin, the\r\nfawner, had disappeared—run away. The news was received with\r\nindifference by the chief, and with evident gladness by not a few of the\r\nothers. When at last it was made intelligible to me, I knew not whether\r\nto rejoice or to be concerned and suspicious of something impending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n                         EXPERIMENTAL GUNPOWDER\r\n\r\n\r\nOur work of creating things of flint began that same day, although the\r\nafternoon was far advanced when we arrived. I was in a fever to complete\r\nour preparations against any future aggressions on the part of the\r\nenemy, particularly as I had a growing conviction that Grin, the\r\ndeserter and treacherous devil, had gone straight away to hunt for the\r\nBlacks. I believed his sole intention was that of betraying his kind and\r\nthereby of wreaking a vengeance for all the punishments which he had\r\nrightfully undergone.\r\n\r\nAll the questions I could ask about the fellow, through the medium of my\r\nfew words in Linkish and my signs, which were supplemented by my native\r\nlanguage, failed to elicit any satisfactory information. Having too much\r\nto do to spend my time in thinking of the beast, I set my selected\r\nassistants to work at splitting out slabs of flint.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the pebbles, I had my fellows bury in a moist, shady\r\nplace, for, labour as diligently as we might, we could not complete the\r\nwork on a third of the stone, as I knew, before the hot air would begin\r\nto render the stuff as hard as glass and quite unworkable.\r\n\r\nDuring all next day we were at it, hammering, chipping and forming. Four\r\nfellows, clever at binding were heading the arrows already provided, and\r\nlashing hatchets and knives to handles. That night, by way of a pleasant\r\ndiversion, I secured some fragments of charcoal, and reducing this and\r\nsome of my sulphur and nitre to a flour, mixed the three together and\r\nground the grayish substance for a time, between two stones. Such a dust\r\narose that I was obliged to sprinkle the stuff with a few drops of\r\nwater. This seemed to help it in combining, but do my best, I could not\r\nmake the mixture resemble gunpowder in the slightest degree. Having just\r\nabout decided to give the task over, as one presenting difficulties too\r\ngreat for me to cope with successfully, I took a palm-full of my\r\nmaterial and, by way of experiment, threw it on the fire.\r\n\r\nInstantly the well-known hiss resulted and a dense cloud of pungent\r\nsmoke arose with such a quickness that I stumbled backward from the\r\nplace, involuntarily. Only Fatty and one or two others of the Links\r\nbeheld this exhibition, the others being already asleep. The fright\r\ndepicted on the faces of this small but select audience was a wonderful\r\nthing to see. I determined at once to set about burning a quantity of\r\ncharcoal, for already I had conceived an idea that it might be possible\r\nto utilise the explosive to advantage, and I intended at least to give\r\nmy scheme a trial.\r\n\r\nOn the day that followed, the first thing I did was to have the Links\r\ncollect a lot of wood, the softest and driest I could find. This I\r\nheaped up in a conical pile and walled in snugly with turf and a little\r\nof the clay, which was everywhere about us. When it was lighted and\r\nsmoking slightly through various small chinks, I banked it up around the\r\nbottom and returned to the work on the flints.\r\n\r\nBefore we got through with those pebbles we had rough but serviceable\r\narrow-heads by the hundreds, knives in plenty, hatchets for all, with\r\nsome to spare, and sixty or eighty spear-heads, which were bound to\r\nlong, stout hafts, in the regular course of finishing up. I reserved for\r\nmy own personal arsenal two axes, two knives and fifty of the finest\r\narrows in the lot. Also I assumed a general command, as custodian, over\r\nall the weapons and utensils in the tribe’s possession.\r\n\r\nNo sooner were the armaments complete than I went to my powder-making\r\nwith indefatigable vigour, thankful for every day that passed without\r\nbringing the foe, which I dreaded and thoroughly expected to see come\r\nswarming up the slope from the woods. I made my fellows pound up\r\ncharcoal till some were nearly as black as the enemy for whom we were\r\npreparing. The powdered stuff we placed in the baskets, several of which\r\nI plastered inside with clay, which dried hard and firm. The saltpetre,\r\nwhich we dug and brought up the hill, was treated in a similar manner,\r\nas was also the sulphur. Anyone to have seen me directing this business\r\nwould have thought I intended to supply an old-fashioned navy with\r\nexplosives.\r\n\r\nDuring these days I in nowise neglected the archery practice, which\r\nalone could make my warriors capable of using the weapons to advantage.\r\nWe shot at a target the size of a man, which I fashioned out of skins\r\nand heavy palm leaves. This being backed by a sort of hedge, constructed\r\nof bamboo and more of the leaves, we lost but few of the arrows\r\nemployed. And the arrows used were not from our pointed stock, though\r\nthey were whittled sharp on the end, so that many pierced the target as\r\nneatly as a bullet. Thirty of my force grew decidedly efficient, being\r\naccurate, strong shots who could be relied upon to perform good work on\r\nany attacking party. We also used the spears, in the throwing of which\r\nthe Links took great delight. I was sure that come what might, the\r\nfellows would never again be so primitive as they were when first I met\r\nthem in the jungle. Whether I left them or not, they would hereafter\r\npossess weapons which would place them far above the Blacks in point of\r\ncapacity to kill.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest difficulties with which I had to contend, while\r\nmaking my powder, was the frequent coming of rain. This threatened to\r\nmake it all too wet to be of any use. There were also many days when a\r\nthick, damp fog rolled upward from the lower levels, slowly evolving\r\ninto a ponderous cloud which covered all the jungle-world. The baskets\r\ncontaining the pulverized materials were doubly protected, however, by\r\nskins, and the roofs of the special dug-outs which we made, but the\r\nroofs were never entirely water-tight.\r\n\r\nBeing unacquainted with the recognised formulæ for mixing various\r\npowders, I simply took about three parts charcoal to one each of nitre\r\nand sulphur, and set the Links to grinding these substances together,\r\nslightly dampening the whole as before. The grayish stuff, which I\r\nregarded finally as the best product of which we were capable, I stored\r\naway, next to my own shelter. There must have been two hundred pounds of\r\nthis powder, the making of all of which had only occupied us for a short\r\ntime, after the several ingredients in their rough state had been\r\nassembled.\r\n\r\nIn order to impress the tribe with the urgent necessity of keeping all\r\nfire away from the baskets, I dropped a glowing coal into a handful as\r\nit lay on a rock. The vivid flash did so much to accomplish my purpose\r\nthat I could hardly get the Links to approach the dangerous mixture\r\nunder any circumstances whatsoever.\r\n\r\nMy next step now was to visit the swamp where the thicket of bamboo\r\nflourished. In this place, as I had expected, there were all sizes of\r\nthis peculiar tree-reed, but the largest ones appealed to me most\r\nstrongly. I carried off what I thought I should need, and selecting the\r\ndriest of my stock, cut off a large section behind the joint, on one\r\nend, and in front of the next joint on the other. The piece then\r\nresembled quite a cannon, without further ado.\r\n\r\nThis thing I was aware was much too brittle to stand an explosion, but I\r\nmeant to try it, nevertheless. To begin with I bored a vent through the\r\nhard, thick shell, near the end that was naturally plugged. Then I\r\nreinforced that plug by lashing a stone across the end firmly. Next I\r\nsplit some more bamboo and laid the strips lengthwise along the barrel,\r\nthus doubling the thickness, after which I had the whole thing stoutly\r\nwound about with tough, slender creepers, till I was sure it would\r\nresist a powerful tendency to burst.\r\n\r\nWhat to do for a fuse, when at length my piece of mountain artillery was\r\nloaded—with powder and rocks—puzzled me no little.\r\n\r\nThe thing was “mounted” half way down the hill, pointed toward an\r\nimaginary foe, and was amply weighted with rocks at the sides and on the\r\ntop. At length I hit upon a plan for the fuse. It was simply to split a\r\ncreeper, the outside of which we frequently employed, and to pull out\r\nthe smooth, wire-like core inside, and then to fill the space so left\r\nhollow, with powder. In the sun this shell of the creeper dried out\r\nrapidly, rolling up so tightly in the process that it squirmed itself\r\ninto several twists. This “habit” of the thing was exactly what was\r\nrequired, for when the powder was laid along inside, the chances for it\r\nto trickle out were exceedingly meagre.\r\n\r\nAbout thirty feet of this fuse I laid to the “gun,” with stones along\r\nits length to keep it properly in place. Then, with a thumping heart\r\nunder my shirt, I proceeded down the hill, alone, with a fire-brand\r\nglowing hotly in my fist. I looked all about, when I came to the match,\r\nand selected my path back up to the camp. Then I touched the end of the\r\ncreeper—and jerked my fire away, quickly.\r\n\r\nThere was no alarming sputter after all. I tried again. The creeper\r\nsmoked, giving forth a pungent odour, but the powder must have fallen\r\nout for a short distance. I cut off six or seven inches and had the\r\nsatisfaction of seeing powder in plenty. This time it lighted and began\r\nto spit in a hurry. I darted off, stopped, looked back, saw a tiny\r\nsmoke-snake running down the hill, and again I ran as hard as I could,\r\nmomentarily expecting something tremendous to happen behind my back.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise I reached the camp and nothing had occurred. I turned\r\nabout and looked, panting and yet attempting to hold my breath. There\r\nwas nothing to be seen, save the heap of rocks where my “battery” was\r\nplanted. I waited and waited. The seconds slipped by; the Links behind\r\nme were as silent as the grave. My heart ceased its violent jumping; the\r\nthing was going to prove a failure; the Links would think me a fool.\r\n\r\n“I’ll have to go down and see what’s the matter,” I grumbled. “That fuse\r\nis no good.”\r\n\r\nI had taken two steps when suddenly a great flare of fire leaped upward,\r\nthe side of the hill appeared to fly into fragments and a roaring\r\ndetonation split the silence into a thousand ringing reverberations. A\r\ncushion of air gave us all a push, and a huge geyser of smoke went\r\nupward in rolling, billowy gushes. I wondered in that second, how many\r\npounds of that powder I had put in the “piece” in my natural anxiety to\r\ngive it a good, square trial.\r\n\r\nSomething screamed weirdly in the air, while we stood speechless, and\r\npresently it came whirring down, a rod below the wall, striking the\r\nground with a sounding thud.\r\n\r\nYelling in dismay, the second they recovered power to do anything, the\r\nLinks fell over each other helter-skelter, in their great confusion, and\r\ndesire to take to the woods. As for myself, I laughed and laughed like a\r\nveritable maniac, and threw my arms about myself and jumped in the air\r\nrepeatedly, as tickled with my exploit as a boy. Then I ran outside and\r\nfound my cannon, the thing which had whistled as it hurtled back to\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nIt was a “goner” and no mistake. Black as a hat, ripped from muzzle to\r\nbreach, blown to pieces at the plugged-up end, it certainly gave the\r\nappearance of having “gone through the war,” but it pleased me not a\r\nwhit the less.\r\n\r\n“Why that’s all right,” I assured the surrounding stillness, “I’ll go to\r\nwork and make a lot of bamboo bombs.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n                          THE TRIBE FRIGHTENED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spot with the pile of rocks, where my cannon had been planted, bore\r\nample testimony to the high explosive quality of my powder, for nothing\r\nwas left in place and everything which had been in contact with the\r\npiece was beautifully blackened.\r\n\r\nMy frightened Links seemed to be anything but confident that I was not\r\nlikely to burst myself, with a loud report, and scatter devastation\r\neverywhere. They stood off a distance that was more than merely\r\nrespectful and were not to be induced to return to my side by any\r\npersuasion or assurances for more than an hour. I had no doubt they\r\nthought me a bit of a devil, for even Fatty and the children were afraid\r\nto return to my side. The single exception to this unanimity of feeling\r\nwas furnished by my little favourite chap who seemed so human.\r\n\r\nThis tot of a Link had been much neglected of late, so busy had I been\r\nwith work. Now when he came and clung to my leg, as I stood in the camp\r\neating a mango and thinking busily, I looked down in his tiny face and\r\nfelt happy to see him so near. Sitting down against my rock, in the\r\nsun-light, I let him cuddle down in his usual place, and together we\r\nenjoyed a time of peace. It became one of those natural spells of rest.\r\nI felt like easing off on the pressure of work for a time, having\r\naccomplished really all that seemed to be needful by way of making ready\r\nto receive any invaders of our village who might choose to come.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of Tike—as I called my little friend—did much to\r\nre-convince the Links of my normal, pacific intentions. Fatty was the\r\nfirst to return, doubtless actuated by a trifling touch of jealousy.\r\nAfter him the others came edging back, one by one, every individual\r\ninordinately curious to see if I were in any manner altered by the\r\nextraordinary disturbance which I had so recently created. All that day\r\nthey evinced alarm and a readiness to run whenever I stirred about. For\r\nthe powder, carefully stored away, they possessed a profound distrust\r\nand respect.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days I sat around for much of the time, always with\r\nwistful little Tike nestled up under my arm. The tiny chap seemed more\r\nquiet than before, if possible, and somewhat thinner. All the other\r\nlittle Links were as fat, rolly, bright-eyed and lively as so many Pah\r\nUte Indian papooses, and equally red and naked, but Tike was almost a\r\nsad little fellow. He leaned his head against me by the hour, sighing\r\nnow and again, and patting my big, brown hand with his wee, red one, as\r\nif there could be no greater content and happiness in the world.\r\n\r\nThe attack I had daily expected and against the advent of which I had\r\nlaboured with such unremitting zeal, had failed to materialise. Day\r\nafter day went by, with such a stillness and peace over all the world,\r\nthat I began to forget the malignant Grin, who had kept the troubles\r\nsimmering constantly, and to forget my fears of the savage Blacks.\r\nWithout the slightest stir or bother, I kept my fellows in training with\r\nthe bows, accompanied the parties on the hunt, kept the baskets and\r\nother essential properties of the camp in good condition and still found\r\ntime leisurely to work at making my deadly bombs.\r\n\r\nThis labour I made simple and easy by selecting sections of bamboo\r\nwhich, when cut off to form cylinders open at one end only, telescoped\r\ntogether. That is the smaller cylinder, containing a large charge of\r\npowder, slipped inside the larger, and each being provided with a stone\r\nreinforcement, where naturally plugged, I bound the two shells together\r\nfirmly. Five of these bombs were enormous, containing probably\r\ntwenty-five pounds of powder. Some of the others were only about a foot\r\nin length and three inches or less in diameter. These smaller ones I\r\nintended to take with me in my boat, if ever I started on my voyage of\r\nescape. I thought I could throw them at any foe which might approach too\r\nnear. Each was provided with a tube-like fuse, stopped with clay, to\r\nprevent the powder from running out, and which could be broken off at a\r\nmoment’s notice to form a connection with the powder in a longer fuse,\r\nwhich could then be bound upon it. I also provided several coils of the\r\nmatch, made of creepers, each coil at least thirty feet in length. This\r\nbecame dry so that I determined that if occasion should ever arise I\r\nwould make a fresh supply, keeping this other ready for emergencies.\r\n\r\nThe days of peace became weeks. So free from trouble had we become in\r\nthe camp, since the disappearance of Grin, that my feverish desire to\r\nflee had somewhat abated. Moreover the albino female had partaken of\r\nsuch a thorough fright, on the day when my ordnance exploded, that she\r\nleft me severely alone. Yet I did think constantly of the boat and\r\nshould have busied myself more with my half-formed project of getting\r\naway, had I not been bound more closely than I realised to the Links by\r\nlittle Tike, who seemed to me to be fading away.\r\n\r\nHe came every morning to my shelter, often before I was awake, and when\r\nat last I stirred and turned over, there he would be, sitting quietly by\r\nthe side of my couch, looking yearningly into my face with his steady,\r\nthoughtful eyes, and holding his tiny hands together in his “lap.”\r\nAlways he greeted my look with a strange, quiet smile, which made his\r\nwee, homely face the very next thing to divine. I got to carrying the\r\nlittle chap about, as I went from place to place. I found that I missed\r\nhim, when resting out in the jungle, after a hunt with my fellows. It\r\nalso gave me a most unreasonable pleasure to talk to the tiny mite, who\r\nwould answer with a faint, half-crooning sound of pleasure. I called him\r\nfrequently my “Little Man.” At intervals, sometimes of days, he would\r\nrepeat the word “Man” in a way that caused me to feel a peculiar thrill\r\nwhenever it came from his lips.\r\n\r\nAs before, my attitude of comparative passivity begot more or less of\r\nthe symptoms of familiarity on the part of several Links. This did no\r\nlittle in the way of deciding me anew to quit the place, if possible. I\r\nwas doubtful in my mind as to which method would be preferable, that of\r\nattempting to find and utilise the outlet of the lake in my boat, or to\r\nendeavour to induce about fifty of the fighters to escort me across the\r\ncountry to the sea. But one day which we spent in the jungle decided me\r\nwithout further mental debate.\r\n\r\nWe were stalking a pair of hogs, which were unusually clever at evading\r\nthe flanking Links and at penetrating far into the jungle, when suddenly\r\nthe great, dark form of a genuine elephant loomed up, as he smashed his\r\nway through a thicket. Instantly every Link in the party screamed out an\r\nimitation “trumpet” of alarm and fled incontinently, as they had on the\r\nformer occasion. This time I had no intention of being left behind, nor\r\nof giving battle to the brute with my fists and knife. I joined the\r\nrunning fellows, endeavouring to make them halt and retire in at least\r\ndecent order, but this effort was utterly futile; their panic was\r\ncomplete and not to be overcome.\r\n\r\nThankful thus to be reminded of the former incident, which I had been\r\ntoo near to forgetting, I decided, even as we hastened away from the\r\nmonarch of the jungle, that the attempt to perform any long and\r\nhazardous march with such a cowardly “army” as this at my heels would be\r\nmadness. I must launch the boat and proceed alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n                           SPORT AT THE LAKE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not a difficult operation to bore some holes in the gunwale of my\r\nboat and to hammer in four stout pegs for row-locks, and then I put in a\r\nseat, constructed of thin bamboo strips, and all was ready. The craft\r\nwas more than sixteen feet long, three feet in the beam and hollowed out\r\nto a depth of about eighteen inches. The launch was not effected until\r\nafter I had secured a long, stout painter to the bow, the rope being\r\nmade of creeper-fibre, twisted and braided. This was pliable and quite\r\nas enduring as hemp.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Links were manifestly afraid of the lake, they were\r\nintensely interested when the craft upon which we had worked so hard and\r\nlong, went splashing into the water. She righted herself in a second and\r\nfloated high above the surface. But when I hauled her in with the rope\r\nand jumped inside, sat down and got out my sweeps, to row, the\r\nastonishment of the fellows was unbounded. They were frightened for my\r\nsafety, uneasy to the verge of whining, as they ran up and down the\r\nbeach, and still were all so fascinated that not one could look at\r\nanything else. Old Fatty acted precisely like one of those dogs who is\r\ncrazy to join his master and yet dreads the water so greatly as to fear\r\neven wetting his feet. He lifted either foot, and half squatted and gave\r\nlittle jumps, as if about to plunge in and make a bold swim for the\r\nboat, till he appeared too ridiculous for words. Then he ran down the\r\nshore and back again and stood with his comical head on one side making\r\nme laugh uproariously.\r\n\r\nThe boat was great! She was inclined to roll a trifle, owing to the fact\r\nthat she was the same size from stem to stern, and therefore minus the\r\nbroad beam which makes a craft steady, but she was remarkably light to\r\nrow and easily steered. Moreover I found, by throwing my weight to\r\neither side, that she had a powerful tendency to return to an even keel,\r\nwhich rendered her almost impossible to turn bottom upward. This I\r\nattributed to the fact that while her sides were comparatively thin, the\r\nbottom was at least eight inches thick, which made her light on top and\r\nheavy below, an excellent arrangement when to give her a larger belly\r\nwas out of the question. I am bound to admit that she had no “lines,”\r\nthat indeed she looked like the log she was, clumsy and quite\r\nungraceful. Nevertheless I was prouder as I sat in her hold than is any\r\ncaptain of the noblest ship afloat.\r\n\r\nI rowed her this way and that, across to a nearby point and then\r\nstraight away down the middle of the lake for half a mile. When I turned\r\nI made out a floating thing a score of yards from the shore on the\r\nleft—one of my alligator acquaintances, swimming about. I was not afraid\r\nof any attack in so large a boat, especially as my nature could not have\r\nbeen so readily surmised by the hungry saurians, while I was rowing. I\r\nshould not have minded a race anyway, for I felt secure on my own\r\nstamping ground and as saucy as a boy with a toy pistol.\r\n\r\nBefore starting back, I noted particularly the outline against the sky\r\nwhich our hill and its neighbours formed, thinking I might be much in\r\nneed of some such guide when I came to go further from home. Then I\r\ndrove my craft with all the speed I could force. Her prow was slightly\r\nabove the glass-like surface and the water swashed backward from her\r\nkeel with a sound that stirred me to immoderate delight in this my\r\nsupreme achievement.\r\n\r\nThe oars were heavy and the row-locks a trifle awkward; we rolled a bit\r\nto one side and I was obliged to keep fetching her nose about to port at\r\nevery dozen strokes, but I made satisfactory time and just before she\r\nshot across the last fifty feet of water and rammed up high on the\r\nshore, a startled fish of some description, leaped bodily out of the\r\nwater and darted off in affright.\r\n\r\nMy friends gave forth various notes of alarm and fell back quickly to\r\nthe shelter of the trees. I was not at all certain whether they were\r\nmost afraid of the fish or of me and the magic which they seemed to\r\nthink I possessed. Fatty, however, was too glad to get me back to care\r\nfor anything else. He fell headlong over the boat in his crazy endeavour\r\nto get his paws upon me and to roll on top of my feet.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the day was too far advanced to permit of any extended\r\nexplorations, I decided to try for a bit of sport.\r\n\r\n“Boys,” said I, remembering an old-time joke, “which would you rather do\r\nor go fishing?”\r\n\r\nI got them to fetch me a long line, made of thongs tied firmly together,\r\nwhile Fatty got a bird for bait and I cut a tough hard hook out of wood.\r\nFor this I chose a V-shaped crutch, one leg of which became the shank,\r\nwhile the other was cut off shorter, sharpened and formed like a barb.\r\nWith the line tied to this, a rock for a sinker and a piece of the bird\r\nspitted on my hook, I got out at the end of the boat and heaved the\r\ntackle out as far as the cord would permit.\r\n\r\nI pulled it back with no result, save for a nibble when I had taken it\r\nalmost in. I thought the fish must be small and near the shore. However,\r\nI tried again. The result was the same, only that I got two nibbles\r\ninstead of one. The third cast was an aggravation, for some miserable\r\nsprat got my bait. We put on a fresh piece and tied it in place.\r\n\r\n“Now,” I grunted, as I threw the line again, “we’ll see if you young\r\nsardines will—”\r\n\r\nA sudden, hard jerk on the line nearly dragged me overboard, neck and\r\ncrop. I had a bite which felt big enough to indicate a whale.\r\n\r\nBracing, I stopped the line abruptly from running through my hands; and\r\nthen began a tug-o’-war. It was not a scientific fight, for I dared not\r\npermit Mr. Fish to take his head for a second, well knowing that when he\r\nturned and slacked the line, the hook would slip from its hold at once\r\nand let him escape. I therefore hauled at him hard and stubbornly,\r\npanting soon and leaning backward, for he felt as heavy as the bottom of\r\nthe lake and quite as unwilling to be led as a mule. The strain came on\r\nthe line and on the hook. If these held—what would we see?\r\n\r\nI worked backward, inch by inch in the boat, till at last I was out on\r\nthe shore. By that time the craft had been hauled off the bank and was\r\nall but ready to float.\r\n\r\n“Here, Fatty,—come here—and help,” I panted.\r\n\r\nFatty understood and while he was filled with misgivings that made him\r\nactually tremble, he laid hold of the line and together we drew it in,\r\nhand over hand. Presently with a mad whirl our catch came floundering\r\nand slashing upward till it splashed the surface, in violent action,\r\nwhen it disappeared like a piece of lead. A minute later we hauled the\r\nthrashing denizen to shallow water and then clean out on the bank. It\r\nwas a good-sized tortoise, fairly hooked, dripping, fierce-looking and\r\nstruggling with all its might to get away.\r\n\r\nFortunately the Links knew something of turtles. Three plucked up\r\ncourage sufficient to despatch our prize at my third shout of, “Shoot\r\nhim! Pig!”\r\n\r\n“Shoot” meant to slay, in any style or form, and “pig” signified\r\nanything in the way of game or a foe. The catch made my friends so\r\nenthusiastic that they wanted no end of fishing. It also provided a food\r\nof which they were fond, and it gave me a nice new basin. Deep-lake\r\nangling having proved to be hot, hard work, I bethought me of trying for\r\nsomething more quiet. Additional line was soon forthcoming, and a run up\r\nto camp provided a bamboo rod, after which I cut a smaller hook and\r\nbaited as before.\r\n\r\nAt the second cast from the boat, I got a good sharp strike, and without\r\nthe slightest ceremony jerked out a silvery fish a foot in length, of a\r\nspecies wholly unknown in my limited category of the finny tribe. In\r\nfifteen minutes I had seven of these, ranging in weight from one to four\r\npounds, I judged, and all of firmer flesh than I had expected to find in\r\nwater so warm. The enjoyable part of all this play was to hear the\r\nexclamations of wonder on the part of the Links, at every successive\r\ncatch. Had I remained there a day, performing this feat every two\r\nminutes, I believe those child-like creatures would have stayed at my\r\nside, marvelling no less at the very last catch than they did at the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nI created an incredible excitement, finally by making Fatty take the rod\r\nin his hand for a cast. He got a bite so quickly that it made him jump\r\ninside his skin, from toes to crown. The fellow would have fallen down\r\nand rolled away had I not held him fast and compelled him to land his\r\nflopping shiner. At this the Links behind us nearly had a fit.\r\nAmusement, curiosity, timidity and desire to come and do likewise made\r\nthem the most excited and entertaining group in the world. One by one\r\nthey worked themselves up to the frenzy of courage necessary to try\r\ntheir luck, but the ticklish, unique sensation of catching a fish so\r\nquickly dispelled their fears that before we finished they were fairly\r\nscrambling for the chance to be the next to try.\r\n\r\nBeholding the immense satisfaction with which males and females, young\r\nand old, cooked and devoured our catch, I wondered that the Links had\r\nnever progressed sufficiently to fish for themselves. The only\r\nexplanation I was able to give was that owing to their dread of the\r\nlake, about the borders of which were innumerable snakes and alligators,\r\nthey had never discovered this food and therefore knew nothing of the\r\nease of taking all they could wish, by various primitive methods.\r\n\r\nA small quantity of tortoise and one of the smaller shiners satisfied my\r\ncraving for a change of diet, for neither was cooked to my liking, nor\r\nwas the flesh of a flavour to give me any particular delight. However, I\r\nthought the Links deserved the play which the nearness of the lake\r\nafforded, and therefore I cut them a score of hooks, that night by the\r\nlight of the fire, and had them prepare a lot of lines to tie at the end\r\nof some bamboo rods which they fetched before the darkness descended.\r\n\r\nFor myself, I laid out a bit of roasted meat and some fruit, got my bow\r\nand arrows together, and otherwise made ready for an early start on my\r\ntour of exploration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n                             AN EXPLORATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lake was a shimmering mirror, dashed with endless splashes of\r\ncolour, when my boat glided swiftly away in the sunshine of the early\r\nmorning. From the jungles that fringed the shores came many sounds of\r\nbirds, singing, screaming and calling out. The noise made by my oars in\r\nthe crude locks seemed to travel far and to echo back from every side.\r\n\r\nBelieving in systematic investigation, I chose the shore off to the\r\nright, along which I intended to cruise that day. I would try the\r\nleft-hand side the following day, if necessary, and then, if the outlet\r\nI was seeking were still undiscovered, I might be obliged to undertake a\r\nmuch longer trip than either of these would become.\r\n\r\nThe alligators had apparently not begun to stir about on the shady side\r\nof the lake. I skimmed along within fifty yards of the shore, constantly\r\nwatching for any indication of a stream flowing outward through the\r\ntrees. The first hour brought no results; in the second I came to “my”\r\ncreek, the stream down which I had plunged that evening of the storm,\r\nwith the savage ourang behind me. Its volume was normal now, and\r\ntherefore much less than when it had bowled me into the lake,\r\nnevertheless it tumbled over its last rocky leap with a pleasant murmur\r\nwhich sounded familiar enough, and bubbles of silver floated away on the\r\nplacid surface of the water. It was good to recognise this old “friend,”\r\nfor it gave me another guide and cleared up my mental map of the lake\r\nand surrounding country.\r\n\r\nBeyond this point there were miniature bays and tedious windings of the\r\nshore, many of which I felt inclined to ignore, but any one of which\r\nmight have hidden the outlet I felt so eager to discover. In not a few\r\nof the trees, which often overhung the water, I discerned troops of\r\ncurious monkeys. Of these there seemed to be almost endless variety, but\r\nall were particularly shy upon beholding the strange creature out on the\r\nlake, though I had no means of determining whether or not they classed\r\nmy boat and me among the ’gators.\r\n\r\nFrom one rather narrow inlet I escaped as quickly as I could turn my\r\ncraft and drive her back to the main body of water, for I nearly pushed\r\nmy oar against a huge boa-constrictor, half hanging from a tree with its\r\nbody partially submerged beneath the surface. Although I saw this\r\nreptile before approaching so near, I readily mistook it for a portion\r\nof the branch from which it depended. What it might have done, had I\r\nrudely disturbed the sleep in which it was quietly indulging, I did not\r\npretend to know; it was quite enough for me that the creature was there,\r\nand that for all the snake family I have a great aversion.\r\n\r\nThe morning sped away. The heat of the day increased, so that rowing the\r\nboat became an irksome task, particularly as I found nothing but\r\ninconsiderable brooks, all of which flowed into the lake. Floating\r\nquietly, with the oars shipped, I ate my lunch and felt somewhat\r\nrefreshed. A full hour of rest was spent in idly dabbling my feet in the\r\nwater. Later in the afternoon I had a swim, but in this the pleasure was\r\nmarred by a too persistent feeling of uneasiness about the monsters\r\nwhich the place might contain.\r\n\r\nIt must have been as late as four o’clock when at length I rounded a\r\npoint and found a long, irregular estuary, not more than seventy feet in\r\nwidth, rank with grass and giving evidence of being the slack-water of a\r\nlarge stream. From its juncture with the lake, I was quite unable to\r\ndetermine its nature; it could have been either an inlet or an outlet,\r\nas far as I could see. Proceeding up the centre of this, I was not\r\nparticularly gladdened to observe that my boat and oars were frightening\r\nthree medium-sized alligators to the cover afforded by the growth on\r\neither side. Also there were great swarms of pestiferous insects,\r\ndancing above the water in the sunlight. However, if this did mark the\r\noutlet, I had to know it; the gauntlet would have to be run. It would be\r\ncomparatively safe, I thought, as long as it was I who continued to\r\nfrighten the alligators, instead of having them perform the office for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThe place seemed literally alive with these monsters. I think it must\r\nhave been a breeding ground, for there were little ones by the score.\r\nThey all continued to be shy, but I confess I was not inspired with\r\nconfidence in any of the creatures, nor yet with a large pressure of\r\ncourage in myself. The insects settled upon me by hundreds. I slapped at\r\nthem constantly, but in a few minutes I was bitten in no fewer than\r\nfifty places upon my hands, face and body and many of these spots had a\r\ndrop or more of blood oozing out to mark their location.\r\n\r\nMade desperate, I rowed as fast as caution would permit, being afraid\r\nevery moment of incurring the wrath or exciting the hunger of some huge\r\nmother ’gator. The estuary wound away tortuously, into a realm weirdly\r\nluxuriant with creepers, giant exotics and trees overhung with parasitic\r\nvines. It narrowed down, also, which brought me nearer the banks, with\r\ntheir crawling life. I presently noted a number of water-snakes escaping\r\nin all directions, some of them near enough for me to strike them with\r\nthe oars.\r\n\r\nThe sun was down toward the far horizon so that this place was in a\r\ndense shade, amounting to gloom. It was just as much as I could do to\r\nget my own consent to going further. It almost seemed as if I would\r\nprefer to live with the Links forever than to have the nightmarish\r\nfeatures of this place increase or be nearer to me. I do not claim to be\r\na man of bravery and this estuary, I confess, gave me the creeps. I was\r\nenormously relieved, in a moment, to hear a sound like rippling water.\r\nThen I rounded a point on which a brood of alligators had just made a\r\nlanding, and saw where the water was in motion.\r\n\r\nIt was flowing into the lake, not out toward the sea. My investigation\r\nof the place had been time and energy wasted, not to mention nerves. In\r\nhaste I swung my craft about and started back. As it stopped for a\r\nspace, to turn, a water-snake crawled up, near the stern and glided\r\nacross. The reptile was large, glistening and altogether as repulsively\r\nheaded as Nature ever constructs.\r\n\r\nI hit at it viciously, and it dodged and plunged into the slimy water\r\nlike a shot. By that time my prow had drifted against the tail of an\r\nalligator which must have been lying asleep, concealed in the grass. He\r\nwaked and gave the boat a bat with his great caudal extremity that made\r\nher quiver, as he scrambled to shore. There was such a chorus of\r\ndreadful sounds then that the creeps chased from my feet to the hair on\r\nmy head. Added to the maddening torture inflicted by the stinging\r\ninsects—some of which seemed large enough to be classed with\r\nvampires—the place gave forth an animal stench comparable only to that\r\nof a den of serpents. I grew “rattled,” in my frantic endeavour to get\r\nout of the place, and rowed against the shore, in one place, and into a\r\ntangle of reeds and vines at another. All of this added to my own\r\nconfusion as well as to the sounds of hissing, squirming away and\r\nfloundering in the water produced by the creatures whose home I had\r\nrudely invaded. Had the beasts turned upon me in that maze of horrors, I\r\nshould have been wild enough to jump out of the boat and try to dash to\r\nshore and away through the swampy tangle and the jungle.\r\n\r\nAs I neared the exit, I did have the misfortune to strike not only the\r\nedge of a sort of grass island, but also the head of a baby ’gator,\r\ntherein hiding. The mother gave forth an angry snort and started to\r\novertake the boat. An oar got caught for a second but I jerked it loose\r\nand plunged it deep for a stroke that shot me away toward the lake. The\r\nfurious reptile gained for a moment, but then I got down to boat-race\r\nwork and slid away in a desperate mood. Paying too little attention to\r\nwhere I was steering, I forgot the tendency of the craft to yaw about to\r\nstarboard, and therefore sent it fairly through a mass of green drapery\r\nhanging from a tree on the right-hand bank; and the tail of a snake\r\nwhich was climbing hurriedly up in the branches, dragged slimily across\r\nmy neck.\r\n\r\nI shuddered and nearly fell forward, but the boat had gained such\r\nheadway that it pushed through everything and was floating free on the\r\nlake in a second. I bent to the oars anew, but Mrs. Alligator had turned\r\nback, defeated. Without waiting for more experiences I headed for home\r\nand commenced a steady pull.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n                          AMAZING DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was nearly dark when at length I beached the boat and made the\r\npainter fast to a tree. The Links were in a state of great anxiety,\r\nfearing the dread lake had swallowed me down. They had fished, during my\r\nabsence, with such success that they had lost every hook, snarled all\r\nthe lines, broken several rods and procured about a hundred pounds of\r\nshiners for dinner.\r\n\r\nA few of the fellows were attempting to fashion new hooks with the\r\nknives of flint. There was promise, in the work of some, indicating that\r\nin this direction at least there was chance for progress. Old Fatty, who\r\nhad whined on the shore when I left in the morning, romped about me\r\ninsanely, as usual. He and little Tike had occupied my shelter\r\nthroughout the day, awaiting my return. My “Little Man” was asleep there\r\nwhen I entered, a troubled look on his serious little face. I carried\r\nhim off to his mother, but he did not awake, so weary had he grown at\r\nhis vigil that warm, long day.\r\n\r\nHe was crooning “Man, man” beside me in the morning, happily, yet so\r\nwistfully that it played upon every cord in my breast. How thin the\r\nlittle fellow looked as he gazed in my eyes with that dumb affectionate\r\nexpression; how different he appeared from all the other Links, with the\r\ngolden sunlight streaming in on his quaint, childish countenance. When I\r\nhad taken my morning bath, I washed the tiny chap. He caught his breath\r\nin funny little gasps, but I think he liked it immensely. Then we ate my\r\nbreakfast. He ate so small a portion that I shook my head and pushed the\r\nfruits aside before I had taken half my usual quantity.\r\n\r\nHaving vaguely thought of my exploration business as a duty to be\r\ncontinued faithfully, I had half intended to leave, later in the day,\r\nfor a shorter trip. When the wee youngster nestled up to be comforted,\r\nthe plan faded away. We would have a quiet day of rest and peace. The\r\nelders of the tribe, discovering my mood, gave up to the laziest of\r\nlounging and rolling about, playing at indolent games and wrestling,\r\nthrowing bits of twigs and pulling at each other’s feet and toes. The\r\nchief and his white mate sat about in a somewhat superior style, the\r\nlatter eyeing me sullenly from time to time, while her husband gazed by\r\nthe hour into the half-clear depths of the great rock-crystal at the end\r\nof his club. The fellow seemed to adore this stone, as well he might,\r\nfor by its weight and his own overtowering height he had made himself\r\nchief of his fellows.\r\n\r\nHis chieftainship continued, although I had long believed I could\r\noverthrow the fellow and usurp his power to add to my own, did I wish to\r\ncreate a disturbance. But inasmuch as I was in no way hampered, and was\r\nobeyed, my position amounted to that of a ruler, while I gave this giant\r\nLink no offense. As long as he continued to feel himself the master of\r\nthe family, my own sway could never be complete, but for this I cared\r\nnothing as long as I was enabled to proceed with my plans. More than\r\nonce I might have taken advantage of the awe created by natural means to\r\nbring the chief under my rule, but I was waiting to see what he would do\r\nof his own accord. The day when my cannon exploded he had been so ready\r\nto acknowledge my leadership that a look would have brought him cowering\r\nto my feet, but I had turned my back upon him and he had refrained from\r\ndoing anything impulsive.\r\n\r\nIn order to provide entertainment for little Tike, this day of rest, I\r\nselected a slender section of bamboo rod and cut him a whistle. By\r\nplacing a second piece inside of this and sliding it up and down, I had\r\na primitive trombone, which begot a craze of delight among all the\r\nLinks. I played this instrument about an hour during which time the\r\nfellows all came crawling up on all fours, to squat about in a circle\r\nwhere they remained, nodding, blinking and holding their heads on one\r\nside, with the greatest attention and pleasure.\r\n\r\nI bethought me then of a drum and procuring a section of bamboo six\r\ninches or more in diameter, stretched a wetted fish-skin across the end\r\nand let it dry there. This thing produced a fine resonant tone that made\r\nthe creatures jump with astonishment at first and dance with excitement\r\nlater. In point of popularity this instrument eclipsed the whistle\r\ntotally. The Links took to it as naturally as a cat takes to mice.\r\n\r\nHaving pleased little Tike and having rested myself, while providing a\r\nholiday of amusement for the tribe, I decided to go at my navigation\r\nagain in the morning. Agreeable as some of these moments appear to have\r\nbeen, I was fretting constantly to be away from the unclean, semi-animal\r\nbeings, and once more restored to my kind and to civilisation, where I\r\ncould lie on a decent bed, eat a decent meal and listen to something\r\nbesides barbarous language. So desperate did I frequently become to hear\r\nmy native tongue, that I spouted every quotation and sang every song I\r\ncould conjure from my memory. This performance was always attended by a\r\ndemonstration of surprise and unrest on the part of all the Links who\r\nwere close enough to hear.\r\n\r\nThe following morning was the cool, still forerunner of another sultry\r\nday. Fatty waddled behind me to the boat, where he whined again and\r\nstarted convulsively every time I bade him “come along,” but to master\r\nhis fear of the lake sufficiently to enter the boat and trust himself\r\naway from the shore, was quite beyond his power. He wanted to go, but\r\nhad he been thrust in by force, he would have scrambled wildly back to\r\nthe bank, to run up and down and dance, like an unwilling dog who has\r\nbeen thrown in the water whether he would or no. I left him, sad and\r\nanxious, on the beach.\r\n\r\nAccording to my previously formulated scheme, I directed the prow toward\r\nthe left shore this morning, and rowed as before, about fifty yards out\r\nfrom the wall of foliage which marked the boundary of lake and jungle.\r\nIn half an hour I passed the place where I had fought the battle with\r\nthe alligator, while I was floating on the log. On this present occasion\r\nnot a saurian could I see, but I knew the place where I was sure there\r\nwere half a dozen.\r\n\r\nThe day was practically a repetition of the other, except that this\r\nwestern shore had a greater number of small streams, and none that were\r\nlarge, contributing to the body of the lake. I dipped into bays and\r\ninlets without number, many of which were of exceeding beauty. These\r\nwere frequently so large that I travelled many miles without being more\r\nthan three or four from camp, by air line. In the late afternoon, when I\r\nhad worked perhaps two miles further away in actual distance—or about\r\neight as I skirted the edge—I approached what appeared to be a deeper\r\nand narrower bay than any before discovered.\r\n\r\nThis arm of the lake presently curved about a point, which made me think\r\nit might perhaps be another tributary stream, or river, like the one in\r\nwhich I had passed a desperate fifteen minutes. I felt not entirely fond\r\nof such experiences and therefore regarded this place with suspicion. It\r\nwas freer of insects than the other had been, although there were some I\r\ncould have spared; while the alligator population was not numerously\r\nrepresented. There was the grass which I thought indicated flowing\r\nwater, however, and the trees on the banks were like those of the other\r\nplace which I dreaded.\r\n\r\nWhen I had penetrated several hundred yards into the jungle on the bosom\r\nof this winding stream, the shadows from the overhanging trees were\r\nagain exceedingly dense. I confess I had a poor stomach for doing much\r\nof this sort of thing at the end of day. My brain began to invent\r\nexcuses for proceeding home and coming again when the light was better.\r\nA number of scares, to which I had been subjected during the day, had\r\ncontributed largely to this lack of proper enthusiasm. Soon I conceived\r\na brilliant scheme for determining whether this stream were inlet or\r\noutlet to the lake. In either case there would be a slight current. I\r\nwould stop the boat and let it drift. If it went on “up” I could be sure\r\nI had found the outlet which in all reason should flow eventually to the\r\nsea; if I drifted back toward the lake, I must continue my search on the\r\nmorrow.\r\n\r\nPulling slowly to the next turning, I brought the craft to a standstill\r\nand awaited results. For a long time I failed to detect any movement in\r\neither direction, so sluggish was the current. I became absorbed in\r\nstudying a number of stakes, which stood in the water, near the bank.\r\n“Surely,” I thought at last, “we are moving slightly—down the stream.”\r\nWas it then actually the outlet for which I was seeking?\r\n\r\nI grew excited as I watched the stakes. Then I began to comprehend\r\nsomething. These stakes suggested order. Could it be possible they had\r\nbeen planted? I could not see how they could get there at such\r\nsemi-regular intervals, in any natural manner. How far did they extend?\r\nWhere was the first one I had noticed? I looked back. Then I was\r\nconvinced, abruptly, that the boat was drifting down the stream much\r\nmore rapidly that I had suspected.\r\n\r\nIt was the outlet!\r\n\r\nThis truth flashed upon me with all the power of instantaneous\r\nconviction. I forgot the stakes and all the line of speculation which\r\ntheir mysterious presence had engendered. I looked toward that green\r\ngate of deliverance. Mentally I saw myself rowing and drifting down this\r\ngentle, winding current, hastening away from this extraordinary\r\nland—away from this jungle fastness to the great open sea. A thousand\r\nsuggestions came tumbling in upon me, as to how to provision my boat,\r\nhow to leave the Links, how to sleep at night on “Outlet” river, how to\r\nsearch for a village when I should find myself at last free, and how\r\nthen to take a steamer and hasten back to the world which was really a\r\nworld!\r\n\r\n“The outlet!” I muttered in fervent thankfulness. “Freedom—Life—Home!”\r\n\r\nI was wrought to a fever in my excitement of hope; I was all but\r\ntransported, thus to find the gate that let me out of my prison of\r\ngreenery, when suddenly I nearly froze from chills and paralysis of all\r\nmy senses and blood-circulation.\r\n\r\nA voice rose clear in the silence of ended day—a human voice, in that\r\nwilderness of jungle and jungle-creatures,—a voice pronouncing words in\r\nEnglish—a singular mixture of words with no reason. Then presently they\r\nsettled into the musical order of poetry:\r\n\r\n  “There was a sound of revelry by night,\r\n    And Belgium’s capital had gathered then\r\n  Her beauty and her chivalry, and bright\r\n    The lamps shone o’er fair women and brave men,\r\n  And when music arose with its voluptuous——”\r\n\r\nI arose to cry out at the top of my voice. A human being—a man, no\r\ndoubt, was in reach of my voice—a friend, companion, perhaps, to share\r\nmy fate and solitude! I filled my lungs for a mighty halloo—a cry to\r\nthis partner in exile—when out from the trees on the bank, not a spear’s\r\nthrow distant, issued a black, ungainly form—and then another.\r\n\r\nLinks! They were black Missing Links!\r\n\r\nThose stakes were theirs! I had found their camp. The voice—this human\r\nbeing—was he then a prisoner? What did it mean—and what should I do?\r\n\r\nTo cry out meant instant detection—perhaps immediate death. The two had\r\nfailed to see me—they might go back. But I was drifting—drifting toward\r\nthem. One of them turned about.\r\n\r\nA yell went up immediately. I was known. The alarm spread like\r\nprairie-fire, up through the wood. I swung the boat about like mad and\r\nheaded for the lake. A club came whizzing through the air, struck in the\r\nwater beside the boat and splashed me with spray. A score of the\r\nvillainous looking devils came running to join their companions. Along\r\nthe bank they dashed in pursuit, crying out and making crazy\r\ngesticulations. The water foamed where it left the oars and it rippled\r\nand swashed from the prow of my craft. Club after club came hurtling\r\ntoward me, end over end. One of these struck the stern a resounding\r\nthump; the demons cried out savagely and showered more. A small one\r\nwould have dashed out my brains had I not been quick to duck to the\r\nbottom of the boat.\r\n\r\nI shot across the river to the opposite side, but a curve gave my\r\ninfuriated pursuers a slight advantage. It seemed as if the thickets and\r\ntrees were simply bridges over which the creatures hurried the faster.\r\nMaking as if to sweep along below them, I back-watered one of my oars\r\nand pulled with the other, at the turn, spinning the boat clean about to\r\nhard-a-port, and sent her ahead so swiftly that all the clubs, which the\r\ndevils threw at point-blank range, plunged stone-head first into the\r\nripples behind.\r\n\r\n“Never touched me!” I bawled out in derision.\r\n\r\nThey screamed in impotent rage. I rounded the curve and sped away with\r\nall the advantage mine. They gave up the chase. Ten minutes more saw me\r\nout on the lake and well away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n                           A SACRED DISGUISE\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I got home I had ample time in which to think. What a strange\r\nconcatenation of events! The outlet discovered, deliverance almost\r\nassured me, and then to find the camp of my bitterest enemy on the very\r\nbank of my gateway to freedom! But that human voice—what could it mean?\r\n\r\nI began to speculate and to reason from deduction. Inasmuch as I had\r\nlost myself and been found by the red Missing Links, it was evident that\r\nanother man could have met with some accident which would have thrown\r\nhim in contact with the Blacks of the same family or species. The Reds\r\nhad treated me with marked consideration from the first, therefore the\r\nBlacks might do the same for another of my kind. More than this, the\r\nBlacks had manifested not only an extraordinary interest in myself, that\r\nday when first I met them at the volcanic peak, but they had also\r\nattempted to abduct me without injury to my body or feelings. I had made\r\nthem my foes by allying myself offensively and defensively with the\r\nReds, but they might not be savage to one who had not so given them\r\ncause. Undoubtedly, I reasoned, they knew man and what he is and had\r\nrecognised me at once. They had desired also to possess me, an\r\ninclination, I reasoned, which had resulted from association with this\r\nother, mysterious man.\r\n\r\nWhat manner of person was it they held as prisoner in their camp? How\r\nlong had they held him captive? To this latter question I mentally\r\nanswered that they had kept him several months at the least, since I had\r\nbeen a considerable time with the Reds, myself, and they had apparently\r\nbecome acquainted with my species before my arrival in the country. Then\r\nabout his capacity as a man, my thought ran quickly to the conclusion\r\nthat he must be weak or at least a man of no inventiveness and of no\r\nparticular inward resources. I arrived at this from two sources of\r\nargument. First, he had obviously done nothing to arm his fellows, even\r\nwith primitive spears, or bows and arrows, to say nothing of never\r\nhaving headed their hunting or fighting expeditions; and, second, he had\r\ndone nothing to escape, although he must have known that he was living\r\non the very edge of that great outflowing river, which should suggest to\r\nhis mind the sea beyond, as it had done to me.\r\n\r\nAlmost without considering anything, my first conclusion had been that I\r\nmust meet this partner-in-exile, enlist his services and make him my\r\ncomrade in escaping. Indeed I had been conscious of a great elation of\r\nspirits, to think of such an encouraging piece of good fortune. Now,\r\nhowever, when I was sure that he was neither bold, nor alert, nor\r\nsuperior to circumstances, I doubted the wisdom of burdening myself with\r\nsuch a companion, in the midst of my accumulated adversities. This last\r\nselfish thought was hardly complete, however, before I banished it with\r\nscorn, as utterly unworthy of any man in my position.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the poor fellow had been shipwrecked, under conditions that\r\nshattered his nerves; perhaps he was crippled, or otherwise disabled;\r\nperhaps he had undergone severe illness; he might even have been an\r\ninvalid when captured; and it was always possible that the Blacks kept\r\nhim bound or so closely attended that action was rendered impossible. I\r\nrecalled then that his voice had not sounded strong. His recitation of\r\nverses and conning over of words, I could understand precisely, for I\r\nhad done the same myself on many occasions. Whatever it was that made\r\nhim helpless, he was a fellow-being and certainly in more or less\r\ndistress. I felt my heart expanding toward him—my unknown partner! I\r\nwould see him, help him and take him with me—or die at his side,\r\nfighting like a devil!\r\n\r\nMy plans, which had been nearly complete for my own escape, became\r\nimmediately most uncertain and scattered. It was not a matter now merely\r\nof stocking the boat, securing my weapons and then proceeding down the\r\noutflowing river, but of bearding the Blacks in their stronghold, seeing\r\nthis man and getting him away. Then would come the running of the\r\ngauntlet past their camp on the river. The first proposition, that of\r\nentering this village of the hostile Links and interviewing my\r\n“partner,” loomed up, unsolved, for careful consideration. That the\r\nfellows were keenly on the lookout, I had demonstrated fully; they had\r\nseen me and sounded the alarm in a style truly masterful if not\r\nadmirable. That they thirsted somewhat for my unwilling gore, I had\r\nprecious small reason to doubt. If I got away with their captive and the\r\ndemons discovered who it was that engineered the feat, there would be a\r\nwarm jungle-region all about the lake.\r\n\r\nHow much could I count on the man I meant to assist? Not a great deal, I\r\nfeared, for he was probably incapacitated in some important manner.\r\nHowever, he had doubtless superintended the hammering down of those\r\nstakes I had seen in the river, which evidently meant some sort of\r\nfishing operations, so that perhaps, after all, he was more inventive\r\nthan I had previously supposed. All the way up the lake, I racked my\r\nbrain for a suitable plan for invading the enemy’s camp. There were wild\r\nideas in plenty, but no one of these was practical or even worthy of a\r\nmoment’s consideration.\r\n\r\nI gave up thinking, when at last the boat was secured on the beach,\r\nknowing how far away my thoughts would be driven by the welcome of the\r\nLinks. All through my dinner, however, even with little Tike in my arms\r\nand Fatty languishing about my feet, I was lost in pondering over the\r\ndoings of the day. That night, although I was weary, I tossed and rolled\r\nuneasily, catching but snatches of sleep between the spells of being\r\nvividly awake over my new discoveries and their attendant problems. Time\r\nafter time I awoke with a start, thinking I had solved the difficulty,\r\nonly to realise that my brain was indulging in the most fantastic of\r\nworkings. My whole being was dominated and occupied by this scheme of\r\nuniting with that human prisoner on the river.\r\n\r\nSometime in the earliest hours of morning I sat up abruptly, having been\r\ntortured by a sort of nightmare in which there was an inextricable\r\ntangle of Links, alligators and bears. As before, this was intimately\r\nconnected with the man whom I intended to rescue from the Blacks, but\r\nthis time I got an idea out of the chaos and it fairly made me twitch,\r\nso galvanically did it grip my whole nervous system.\r\n\r\nI would visit the hostile camp in safety, because I would go as a bear.\r\n\r\nA bear—yes, a sacred black bear! Those superstitious creatures should\r\nworship my tracks and make themselves fools over my visit, while I spied\r\nupon them, planned against them and robbed them of their captive! I\r\nshould be more than safe, more than free to come and go as I liked, more\r\nrespected than the general of the world’s greatest army.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to get my plans in operation, I must kill a bear, skin\r\nhim and cure the hide. This preliminary business presented no\r\ninconsiderable sum of difficulties, as I was thoroughly aware. “First\r\nfind your bear,” said the funny fellow in my brain. This part I thought\r\nI could manage, for I had seen a bear in the neighbourhood of the place\r\nwhere the one had appeared that morning after my fight with the\r\nalligator. I thought him the same identical animal, which might\r\ntherefore abide in or about that quarter. But having secured my bruin’s\r\npelt, there remained the task of curing it,—a work which I must conduct\r\nalone and away from camp, inasmuch as the Links would be horrified to\r\nknow that I had committed the deed on so sacred a beast.\r\n\r\nThere was no more sleep for me after thinking of this. At the first\r\nsuggestion of dawn I crept out, silently, avoided old Fatty, who was\r\ncurled down beside my door, and glided noiselessly down the hill, armed\r\nwith a club, my knife, bow and quiver of arrows. When I arrived at the\r\nedge of the lake I went a little into the forest and dug some fresh\r\nsaltpetre. With this substance I intended to preserve the skin, for not\r\nonly are its properties well suited to the business, but I was denied\r\nthe use of our spring of brine by the presence of my bear-adoring\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nWith my cargo of stuff thrown down in the end of the boat, I pushed away\r\nfrom the bank and rowed slowly off toward a point around which I meant\r\nto be concealed by the time the Links would begin to stir. The dawn was\r\nbreaking as I neared my destination, but I waited for full day-break\r\nbefore attempting to go ashore. When at length the boat ran up on the\r\nbeach I was a mile from the swampy region in which the alligators had\r\nproved themselves so numerous and hungry. A small clearing afforded an\r\nadequate retreat, where I felt that I could operate without interruption\r\nor likelihood of being observed.\r\n\r\nWith the club and quiver on my back, and the bow in hand, I forced my\r\nway through a stubborn growth, coming presently upon the trail of some\r\njungle creature which had apparently broken this path for the purpose of\r\ndrinking at the lake. I had gone no more than several strides in this\r\nbeaten track when I nearly stepped upon a hooded snake. Though I jumped\r\nback quickly and made ready with speed to hit the reptile with my club,\r\nit glided away before I could fetch it a blow, escaping into a maze\r\nwhere I own I dared not follow. Willing enough to let the creature\r\nalone, if it would do the same by me, I went on my way. Then occurred\r\nthe thought, if only I could have killed it and poisoned my arrows, how\r\nmuch better I should be armed for the bear.\r\n\r\nGoing back I thumped about for several minutes, looking for the venomous\r\nserpent, yet dreading to see it. There was little danger of seeing that\r\nparticular snake again, so I once more resumed my journey. Having the\r\nvenom thought in mind, I decided to search for a serpent deliberately,\r\nfor the sake of its poison.\r\n\r\nSnake hunting is not in my line. I kept an eye open and peered about in\r\nlikely places but the reptiles I saw were not the venomous kind and they\r\nwere often of the constricting variety, so that they and I had nothing\r\nin common. I passed them by frequently, in haste to be about my\r\nbusiness. The whole morning was passed in this half-hearted search for\r\nvenom. In the early afternoon, having worked through a wide belt of\r\ntrees, I issued forth in the largest clearing I had seen since leaving\r\nthe boat. It was hardly more than fifty feet wide by one hundred long,\r\nslightly swampish under foot and overrun with vines, gigantic flowering\r\nplants and the rankest of grass.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of this place I had the luck to see the tail end of what I\r\nthought to be a venomous snake. The reptile was nearly safe from harm\r\nbeneath a mass of interlocking creepers, yet I tried to get at him and\r\nbecame so absorbed while poking about the brush that I clean forgot my\r\nmore important quest. In the midst of this dallying about, I left my\r\nposition to run around to the further side of the tangle, and found\r\nmyself confronted by the creature of all creatures which I regarded as\r\nparticularly mine—a bear as black as soot.\r\n\r\nThis animal was nosing about the trunk of a tree. He was only five or\r\nsix long strides away, paying no tribute of attention whatsoever to me\r\nor my prowess. That he had seen me and heard me I could not possibly\r\ndoubt. I knew at once that the veneration in which he was held by the\r\nLinks grew out of this remarkable inoffensiveness and the grave, knowing\r\nair with which the creature kept about its own concerns. I longed for a\r\nwell-poisoned arrow, but the time being inopportune for regrets, I\r\nsilently fitted my choicest shaft on the bow-string and stepped aside\r\nfor a better chance to shoot.\r\n\r\nThe bear rose partially up on its haunches, to investigate the tree,\r\npresenting an open front, with a bit of white fur at the throat. With\r\nthis white for a target, I raised my weapon and drew the arrow to the\r\nhead. It leaped across the meagre distance like a flash of light and\r\nquivered a second, buried deep in that snowy fur, which was dyed with\r\nred before the creature could drop to a normal position on its feet.\r\n\r\nI expected to hear a roar of rage, and then to be attacked forthwith by\r\nthe infuriated animal, but instead the bear made a sound almost human in\r\nits vivid expression of agony. It staggered slightly and brushing at the\r\nshaft with its paw, started away toward a thicket. Not to be cheated of\r\nmy pelt, I threw down the bow and dashed after the creature, club in\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nIn a second or two I was almost on his back. He half turned about—and\r\nmet the descending club with his head. Simply moaning, this singular\r\nanimal shuddered down in its tracks, breathed heavily a moment and was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nIf I hunt till I kill a thousand creatures I shall never feel so guilty\r\nof murder as I did to see this harmless bear lying motionless there in\r\nthe jungle. If only it had fought me, threatened my life, or shown\r\nitself malignant, I could have done the deed cheerfully. If only the\r\ncreature had growled, or even torn up the grass, I should have felt a\r\nbit of relief; but to see it die as I knew it had lived, unaggressive,\r\ngood-natured and retiring—this made me feel that I was the brute and the\r\nwanton destroyer of life. Even dead, the animal accused me of lust for\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n“No,” I finally said to the body, aloud, “I would never have done this\r\nmerely for fun. I needed your skin,—hang it! there’s a human life at\r\nstake and you ought to be glad!”\r\n\r\nFortunately I was easily consoled. I came to my senses in a\r\nbusiness-like manner. The skinning did much to remove the last vestige\r\nof my sentimentality, for it was a tough, hot job. My knife was none too\r\nsharp, despite its recent honing on a rock, and the bear was heavy to\r\nturn. When at last I had the hide removed, with the feet and head left\r\non, I rolled the whole mass up and got it on my shoulder. It was heavy\r\nand wet; I felt the need of haste, and therefore with my weapons duly\r\ngathered together and so disposed as to cause me the least possible\r\ninconvenience, I strode away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n                             AGAIN BESIEGED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was ready to disappear by the time I reached the boat. Embarking\r\nas soon as I had cut a large quantity of leaves, I rowed until I was\r\nsome distance out on the lake before completing my day’s work. This\r\nlabour consisted of skinning the head of my bear and then of wetting the\r\nwhole hide thoroughly. With a generous hand I spread the saltpetre upon\r\nthe fleshy side, after which I rolled the skin up in a bundle and stowed\r\nit away in the stern, where I covered it over thickly with the leaves,\r\nin order that my fellows might not see the beloved black fur.\r\n\r\nKnowing the beach would be deserted as soon as darkness began to\r\ndescend, I pulled homeward leisurely, reaching the landing after the\r\nstars had begun to twinkle. There I got a lot of clay and placed it on\r\ntop of the leaves which covered the pelt. This I knew would serve the\r\ndouble purpose of hiding my treasure from sharp, inquisitive eyes, and\r\nof keeping the moisture in the skin till the saltpetre could permeate\r\nthe whole mass and convert the perishable and evil-smelling hide into\r\nleather. In order further to insure the skin against anything which\r\nmight be tempted to meddle, I tied a big rock to my painter and dropping\r\nit overboard anchored the boat about forty feet from the shore. After\r\nthis I swam and waded to the bank.\r\n\r\nAs I had left in the morning before any of the Links were awake, I\r\nthoroughly expected a flattering demonstration on my return to the top\r\nof the hill. I was totally unprepared, however, to hear the wildest\r\nimaginable beating of our drum, the moment I shouted to let them know I\r\nhad come. And when I came through the gate and loomed up in the glow of\r\nthe fire, there was more than enthusiasm—there was madness rife in the\r\ntribe.\r\n\r\nThe fellows were nervous, wild-eyed, starting at every sound, chattering\r\ncrazily in their few poor monosyllables, and they showed a readiness to\r\nbury me in a heap of their prostrate bodies, so eager was their\r\nsupplication for something which they much desired. Males, females and\r\nchildren had evidently been huddled together in a trembling mass, at my\r\narrival, but now the whole population was about me, mad to tell me news\r\nof some calamity, I thought, but rendered wholly unintelligible by their\r\nhaste and fear. I pushed them away vigorously, convinced that something\r\nmore than merely my unaccountable absence and safe return had wrought\r\nthis excitement.\r\n\r\n“Fatty,” I demanded of my half-blubbering slave, “what’s the matter?\r\nStand still and tell me like a man. What’s eating all these idiots? What\r\nhas happened?”\r\n\r\nHe made an effort that was truly heroic.\r\n\r\n“Peegs,” he said. “Gee wizz!”\r\n\r\nThe rascal knew I never exclaimed “Gee whizz!” till something\r\nextraordinary occurred. So poignant did the silly words become in this\r\nconnection that I jumped at what he meant to convey at a single mental\r\nbound.\r\n\r\nHe meant that we were again invaded. The black Links had marched upon\r\nthe village in force. I was almost carried to the further side of our\r\nwall, from which place I could see the campfires of the enemy, fitfully\r\ngleaming through the trees, below. The creatures were intrenched at the\r\nedge of the jungle, just at the base of our hill. But they had not yet\r\nattacked our position, that was evident. I was amazed at this and also\r\nat the fact that they dared to remain all night so near the haunts of\r\nthe savage prowlers.\r\n\r\nI worked for an hour endeavouring to calm my fellows sufficiently to get\r\nsome sort of a “statement” of what had really occurred. The words I knew\r\nof their language and the little they tried to comprehend of mine served\r\nonly to aggravate our confusion. By means of signs and various\r\npantomimes I was able to make some guesses. The most important of these\r\nwas that the foe had come there late in the afternoon, whereupon my\r\nfriends had retreated inside the walls and waited, armed with their\r\nclubs, while Fatty made a hideous noise on the drum.\r\n\r\nAttributing little virtue to the power of our musical instrument, and\r\ngroping about for the reason why the invaders had not attacked the camp,\r\nI concluded that something in the way of a deeply laid “plot” was being\r\nformulated by the Blacks, who were perhaps intent upon our total\r\ndestruction, in payment for all the defeats inflicted upon them by us in\r\nthe past. Whether only a portion of their force had come up, or whether\r\nthey reckoned on our disinclination to leave our stronghold and charge\r\nupon them and so intended to surround and starve us out, was a matter\r\nwhich time alone could determine. I thought of Grin, however, and\r\nwondered if the wretch were with them. Also I mentally nodded my\r\nrecognition of the fact that my “visit” to their camp had been largely\r\ninstrumental in bringing about this war-like advance. I thought it\r\nlikely that the creatures concluded I had been spying upon them, with a\r\npossible attack for my object, and that then they had determined to be\r\nthe first to strike. Doubtless, I meditated, they had long contemplated\r\nthis war of retaliation, and my presence in their river had precipitated\r\nmatters, which had been delayed for various reasons of state.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as their reasons and plans could never be known by any man, I\r\ngave up pondering about them and devoted my thoughts to planning my own\r\ncampaign. On the whole I was not exceedingly sorry to have a chance to\r\ntry my bamboo bombs. I entertained no doubt of the dire effect which\r\nthese would produce on our foe. For that night, at least, we were safe\r\nfrom attack; no Link would dare proceed a score of yards from his fire\r\nin the darkness. If they crept up the hill and surprised us in the\r\nmorning, while we were still in bed—then so much the worse for us, for\r\nbeing so extremely luxurious and confident in the noise of our drum.\r\n\r\nI signified my desire for something to eat and then devoured a hearty\r\nmeal, a proceeding which surprised and calmed the Links no little. They\r\nhad been too much alarmed before to do anything but huddle together,\r\nlike so many animals in a corner, ready to fight if pressed another\r\ninch, but more likely to be furious and savage through fear than through\r\nany sort of courage. They were not wholly cowardly, but they were\r\nmortally afraid of the Blacks (who came back so persistently for more\r\npunishment), especially while here on our isolated hill, with neither\r\ncave nor near-by jungle into which to run. They were awed by this\r\nimplacable foe, and having depended on me to defeat the Black army, had\r\nbecome less confident of their own powers than they were when I first\r\ncame into the tribe. However, they had always evinced the greatest\r\nreadiness to attack a force smaller than their own, which fact, coupled\r\nwith their present behaviour, was now as good as an accurate report to\r\nconvince me that the fellows were sure the number of Blacks below was\r\nmuch in excess of our own.\r\n\r\nGratified to find that our supply of arrows had not been wasted again in\r\nmy absence—an indication of sense in my fellows which I attribute to the\r\nwholesome dread they had of the powder magazine, in which the weapons\r\nwere stored—I laid out the shafts, with the bows, and otherwise\r\nexhibited an assuring alertness and desire to be prepared. The Links did\r\nme the honour of picking up a bit of courage, under my influence, making\r\nme feel a half-affectionate regard and sympathy for the poor child-like\r\ncreatures, for it was plain that they strove hard and constantly against\r\ntheir mental limitations. They wished to understand, to enlarge the\r\nscope of their brains, to be like men.\r\n\r\nI felt a certain pride in knowing that my sentries, when I set the watch\r\nand bade the others go to bed, would remain awake and alive to their own\r\nresponsible position; I felt like something of a general, to see my\r\nagitated fellows calmed down and proceeding to rest in an ordinary\r\nmanner. If I could only hold them together, organised as warriors,\r\nshooting steadily in the face of a charge, I knew we could repel those\r\nBlacks much more easily than ever before and inflict upon them such a\r\nloss that they might be completely quelled for years to come.\r\n\r\nEvery personal plan had been driven out of my head by this unexpected\r\nadvent of “war.” I thought of nothing but what might occur in the\r\nmorning and what would be our most effective means of conducting the\r\nhill-top part of the coming engagement. I was undecided, particularly\r\nabout the use to which I had best put the bombs, for I realised that if\r\nI attempted to throw them, I might inflict half the injury on ourselves,\r\nnot to mention the panic sure to be produced within our walls. Under the\r\ninfluence of such a feeling, my fellows might commit the gravest\r\nindiscretions.\r\n\r\nDismissing the whole affair from my weary brain at last, I retired,\r\nsurrounded by my weapons, and was deep in dreamless sleep in a moment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n                           LOST IN THE JUNGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I suddenly sat erect, with a feeling that the battle was on and I\r\ntoo late to assume my part, it took me a second to realise what had\r\naroused me from sleep. It was only little Tike, who had come to my side\r\nin the semi-light of dawn and laid his tiny hand upon my face.\r\n\r\nNot one of all the babies I have known in my life ever made a sweeter\r\nsound of crooning than did my Little Man that morning, as I held him\r\nsnugly cuddled in my arm. It seemed to me the wee chap told how he had\r\nsearched my deserted shelter all the day before, and all the other days,\r\nsince I had been away so much; it seemed as if he forgave me and forgot\r\nthis neglect and made himself a promise that I would not go away and\r\nleave him any more. The light increased, chasing the shadows away from\r\nhis thin, little face, but under his wistful eyes were shadows far too\r\ndeep to be dispelled by any light of earth. I noted this and observed\r\nthat his lip was inclined to tremble; his eye-lids seemed to be heavy as\r\nlead. What a singular little face it was—such a homely, tiny, monkey\r\nface, with phases of child-humanism coming and going across its\r\nlineaments.\r\n\r\n“Man,” he said, “man,” and he patted my hand and gave a little shiver of\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nI carried him out with me when I went to investigate the situation.\r\nBelow me, where I had seen the fires the night before, there was nothing\r\nvisible of any of the foe. I noted a thin wisp of smoke, curling lazily\r\nupward above the lowest trees, and I presently detected the shaking of a\r\nbrush, denoting the presence of one of the black fellows, who was spying\r\nupon us, unobserved. How I longed for a good rifle to rest on top of our\r\nwall with its muzzle aimed down there at the cover of the demons!\r\n\r\nMy fellows stirred about with commendable promptness, sixty of them\r\narmed with the bows, all of them eagerly watching to see what I intended\r\nto do. They commanded a certain thrill of admiration, for they were\r\nimpressively muscular, alert and active. I could almost fancy them\r\nsoldiers, some day, disciplined, efficient and worthy of trust.\r\n\r\nAs the sun began to warm the earth, the invaders below commenced to move\r\nabout more freely. Although they brandished their clubs toward us and\r\nseemed to swarm all through that portion of the jungle, there was no\r\nindication that the creatures intended to make an immediate attack. I\r\nwas soon convinced that they were there in great numbers. What their\r\nplan would be I found myself unable to surmise, but it was plain the\r\nfellows were being held in check for some extraordinary measure. I had\r\nbeen obliged to admit before that these Blacks exhibited certain marks\r\nof superiority over my Reds, in points of aggressiveness and stratagem,\r\nbut this game of waiting and deliberate planning surpassed anything they\r\nhad performed since I first made their honoured acquaintance.\r\n\r\nAs far as anything could be deduced from the position now occupied by\r\nthe besiegers, I concluded they meant to surge up the slope, at this\r\npoint of advantage, where the grade was easy and unobstructed. I own I\r\nshould have felt relieved had the savages commenced the war at once.\r\nThere was something ominous about this deliberation which I in nowise\r\nrelished. While I was attempting to put myself in their place, for the\r\npurpose of thinking what I would do, knowing what they did of the\r\nreception they were likely to meet upon storming the summit, I heard\r\ndistant yelling in the jungle. This drew nearer, after which the sounds\r\nreceded again in the distance.\r\n\r\nWhat might this incident portend? I inquired of myself, but I could\r\nthink of no satisfactory answer. In our larder we had a limited supply\r\nof fruit and no meat fit to cook. I divided everything as equitably as\r\npossible, but none of us had enough for a hearty breakfast. Old Fatty,\r\nwho observed me putting aside a portion of my share, put away the whole\r\nof his, like a faithful dog who refuses to eat while his master is in\r\nany way afflicted.\r\n\r\nDuring our meal, and while I was concerning myself with the question of\r\nhow we should manage to supply the camp with more provisions, I noted a\r\ndistant tumble of mist, arising from the lowlands, like a cloud of smoke\r\nfrom heavy artillery. This grew and spread with great rapidity. I\r\ncomprehended at once that a fog would soon envelope all the world. At\r\nfirst I thought this solved the problem of the Blacks’ new game of war.\r\nI believed they had waited for this to occur, with a knowledge that it\r\ncame reliably often, intending to swoop upon us under its cover and\r\nstrike us down before we could realise the meaning of the charge. A\r\nmoment later, however, I knew they would never dare attack in even\r\nsemi-darkness. The fog was not a thing which a Link would think of\r\nemploying.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I had an idea that fog was exactly a thing of which man would\r\ntake advantage. I would utilise this one to the fullest extent. Watching\r\nits progress now in excitement, for fear it might be too local to\r\ninclude our hill, I was aware of a repetition of the yelling in chorus,\r\nwhich I had noted before, out in the forest. I could think of no reason\r\nwhy a portion of the besieging army should thus be off in the jungle,\r\nmaking such a racket, but the fellows about me began to manifest the\r\ngreatest alarm. The sounds again drew nearer and nearer; the fog rolled\r\nin, apparently on the heels of this party in the jungle. It seemed\r\nalmost like a race between the mist and this battalion of the invading\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nI heard the yelling creatures swerve off to the right. Their very\r\nposition was revealed by the rising of a large flock of parrots, all of\r\nwhich made a considerable noise as they flashed brilliantly in the\r\nsunlight a moment and swept down again, a hundred yards from where they\r\nrose. Just as I began to have an indefinite anxiety about the game being\r\nplayed below us, the fog enveloped that portion of the jungle where the\r\nfoe were conducting their mysterious operations. I fancied a wail of\r\ndisappointment finished their chorus of cries, after which the fog\r\nseemed to blot out all sound as well as all the panorama below our\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nSilently the great pall spread and travelled, till I saw it climbing the\r\nslope between ourselves and the camp of the Blacks.\r\n\r\n“Now we’ll fix ’em,” I cried to my warriors. “They have played their\r\ngame and now we’ll play the joker.”\r\n\r\nGoing to the magazine I hurriedly uncovered all my bombs and took out\r\nall but the smallest three, together with a quantity of fuse. This\r\nlatter had become so dry that I felt the greatest confidence in the\r\ndryness of all the powder. Bidding my most intelligent and obedient\r\nfellows take these up with care, I lifted the two largest myself and led\r\nthe way through the gate and started down and around the hill, toward\r\nthe entrenchment of the Blacks.\r\n\r\nAt once my fighters halted, afraid of the fog and more afraid of the\r\nenemy in waiting. I stormed and coaxed and threatened before I could get\r\nthem to follow, but Fatty came and then another, after which the others\r\nfelt ashamed to remain behind. Thus I got the small force a little more\r\nthan half way down the slope, where I directed them to deposit the bombs\r\non the ground and to dig a long, narrow trench across the path up which\r\nI believed the Blacks intended to come when at last they made their\r\nassault upon the summit.\r\n\r\nIn the bottom of this ditch, which was made two feet deep in a time\r\namazingly brief, I arranged my bombs, about a foot apart, hurriedly\r\nattaching a fuse to each, making the matches as nearly of a length as\r\npossible. The mines extended for so considerable a distance that I\r\ndetermined to lay two series of main fuses. This I did by bringing\r\ntogether the matches of all the bombs on the right, in one bunch, and\r\nall on the left in another. At these junctions I cut each fuse off to\r\ninsure freshness and to guarantee ignition of the powder, after which I\r\nweighted them down with rocks, placed the end of the main fuse in\r\ncontact with them and sprinkled powder plentifully about to unite them\r\nall in one train. A similar arrangement being completed for the second\r\ngroup, I had the whole mine covered carefully, with rocks and earth,\r\nwhen I trailed my main matches up the hill, had them weighted down and\r\nbrought the ends together several rods below our wall.\r\n\r\nThe Links were willing enough to return inside our gate. I had them\r\nremove a few of the stones from the wall at a point just opposite my\r\nfuses, and then we conveyed some embers from the fire with which to\r\nkindle a special blaze wherefrom I intended to snatch a lighted brand\r\nwhen the moment should arrive for touching off the match.\r\n\r\nAll being in readiness I should have been gratified to see the fog roll\r\naway and the enemy starting up the hill in a solid phalanx. We stood on\r\nguard as an extra precaution, in case the Blacks should summon a courage\r\nsufficient to attack us under cover of the mist, but the world was\r\nsilent and the objects about us were ghostly in the vaporous shrouds.\r\nThe hours wore on and the fog continued thick and warm. We had all been\r\nhungry before the mist arose; we were now growing restless and desperate\r\nto satisfy our cravings.\r\n\r\nTo add to my own discomforts I began to worry about the fuse absorbing\r\ndampness. Should it be ruined by the fog the mines would be useless.\r\nWhat might happen then was beyond conjecture, for we should have no\r\nlarge bombs to use, and the small ones left in the magazine could not be\r\nprovided with fuse. In the midst of my troubles, little Tike came\r\nstumbling against my leg. He fell down at my feet, but was up at once\r\nand gazing in my face with his odd little smile playing lightly on his\r\nlips. I took him on my arm and going to my shelter gave him all he would\r\ntake of the fruits. Fatty, on seeing this, fetched his hidden store and\r\nrolled about in ecstasy when he had placed it before me. I ate a piece\r\nof his hoarded fruit to please the old fellow, after which I\r\nendeavoured, vainly, to get him to eat what remained.\r\n\r\nHe was ravenously hungry, so much so that he could not keep his eyes\r\nfrom the tempting mangoes and papaw, nor keep his tongue from lapping at\r\nhis chops, yet he still refused to eat when I signified that I should\r\ntake no more. He concealed the hoard again, returning to his place with\r\nhis stomach empty.\r\n\r\nOnly once, since my advent among the Links, had a fog remained all day\r\nto obscure the hills and forest, but this one threatened to perform a\r\nsimilar feat. From time to time it lifted for a moment from a local\r\narea, only to descend again more quickly than before. I began to believe\r\nthat perhaps it might be possible for a party of us to deploy on a\r\nforaging tour and visit the grove of fruit-bearing trees. Unfortunately\r\nthe Blacks had made their camp in the most accessible “orchard,” which\r\ngave them a great advantage. However, I knew of several cocoanut palms,\r\na little removed from the enemy’s position, which I thought I could\r\nfind, even in the dark. I decided to make an attempt to reach this\r\ngrove.\r\n\r\nIt was well along in the afternoon by this, and the fog still hung\r\nheavily on the country. As before, I had considerable trouble in getting\r\na force of fellows to back me in the enterprise. But the hungriest\r\nbecame the bravest and therefore with ten stout fellows, all armed, I\r\nleft the wall behind and went cautiously down the hill.\r\n\r\nVery soon I found that everything appeared so altered in the mist that\r\npiloting my party was not at all an easy matter. I disliked exceedingly\r\nthe prospect of finding myself in the enemy’s lines, but having started,\r\nI was too proud, or too stubborn, to do such a sensible thing as retreat\r\nand own myself baffled. We therefore proceeded uncertainly along, near\r\nthe edge of the trees, getting deeper and deeper, it seemed, into the\r\nmaze of fog and unfamiliar objects. The mist down here was much more\r\ndense than that which floated about the camp above.\r\n\r\nAs we prowled stealthily ahead, looking aloft at the shadowy trees, the\r\ncurtain of vapour was rended about us, abruptly, leaving us bare—as it\r\nwere—and completely revealed. On the second a cry of alarm broke from a\r\nBlack, not fifteen yards away, and a chorus of yells made answer, as a\r\nscore of the demons rushed out from the cover of trees, to give us\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nMy nimble fellows vanished like shadows, bounding swiftly up the slope\r\nand into the kindly bank of fog, before the Blacks could so much as\r\ncount their heels. I also started to dash away toward the camp, but\r\ntripped over a rolling stone and fell down heavily, my ankle sprained\r\nand pain shooting all through my leg and body. Scrambling on hands and\r\nknees in desperate haste, I made toward the fog, conscious that three or\r\nfour of the Blacks were dashing toward me. I breathed a great sigh of\r\nrelief and thankfulness to see the mist close in upon the place.\r\n\r\nTurning instantly, when this veiling pall was about me, I moved at the\r\ntop of my speed toward the trees and undergrowth of vines. I heard the\r\ncry of triumph which burst from the lips of the creatures who thoroughly\r\nexpected to leap upon me, and I heard even the quick, light tread of\r\ntheir feet as they ran, but the turn had deceived them and diving into\r\nthe tangle of leaves and creepers, pushing my bow and dragging my aching\r\nfoot, I lay at full length, to pant, for a brief time, when I crawled\r\nlaboriously off in the direction which I believed to be opposite the\r\ncamp of the foe.\r\n\r\nMy pursuers raced about at random on the slope, chattering in disgust\r\nand amazement, but they were soon confused by the fog. They searched\r\nabout for several minutes, one of them coming almost upon me, as I lay\r\nbeneath the vines, but at last all returned to their savage companions.\r\nI could now guess the direction of the camp they had formed by the\r\nsounds they made in retiring. This direction seemed entirely contrary to\r\nwhat I had mentally determined to be right. However, I crawled away from\r\nthe vicinity which I now knew bordered on their position, and turned to\r\ngo toward the hill.\r\n\r\nDoubtless the pain in my ankle distracted my attention, but at any rate\r\nwhen I had crept a distance which I thought should have been sufficient\r\nto place me out of the forest and on the slope, there was no hill\r\nvisible and the jungle seemed equally deep on every side. Thinking I had\r\nprobably made a mistake of a point or more, by my mental compass, I\r\nstarted off again, in a slightly different direction.\r\n\r\nThis soon became hopeless. I realised that the fog had confused me a\r\ntrifle, but it seemed too absurd that I should not find the clearing and\r\nthen be able to go to the top of the hill. In fifteen minutes I had\r\nbecome so muddled that I dared not move another yard. It appears\r\nridiculous, but I was lost.\r\n\r\nJungle, I had found before this, was quite sufficiently difficult to\r\ntraverse toward a given point in the brightest light, but enveloped in a\r\nfog it became the most bewildering and maddening maze. To make matters\r\nworse, the day was nearly spent, my ankle pained me exceedingly and my\r\ndread of snakes became a factor which contributed much to my nervous\r\nexcitement. I leaned against a tree, finally, convinced of the\r\ninexpedience of blundering about in a hit-or-miss effort to rectify my\r\nfirst mistake. If I got any deeper in the tangle, I thought, I might not\r\nbe able to find myself, even by the full light of day.\r\n\r\nTo stand there in that inhabited place of horrors, knowing that the sun\r\nwas departing in its race toward the western horizon, feeling anxious\r\nand uncourageous, aching from my foot to my thigh, and angry with myself\r\nfor being such a fool,—this was about as comfortless a thing as I had\r\never undergone. I was sure the fog would lift from the hill while it\r\nstill surrounded me; I was certain the Blacks would swarm up the slope,\r\nstorm the place, murder half my Links and drive the others pell-mell to\r\nthe woods; and I was not at all convinced that I should ever issue forth\r\nfrom that jungle alive.\r\n\r\nI listened, expectantly, but not a sound could I catch, either of\r\nprowling brutes, nor of attack on our village; the silence was\r\nparticularly oppressive. Darker and darker grew the forest. I knew at\r\nlast the sun had set on an ocean of fog. Perhaps the attack had been\r\nrendered impossible, for that day at least, but wherein my condition was\r\nbettered by this descent of night was more than I could discover. My\r\nthoughts were hardly more cheerful when I pictured the breaking of dawn,\r\nthe hill-top clear and distinct in the light, and the blood-hungry enemy\r\nsweeping the summit of every vestige of our work and genius.\r\n\r\nOne hour, two, perhaps three elapsed—a time that seemed a century. I had\r\nremained all the while at the foot of that tree, without attempting to\r\nmove about. I was doomed to remain there, helpless and impotent, it\r\nseemed, for any time which might prove agreeable to the gods of fortune.\r\nMy thoughts had wandered afield, so that doubtless I had forgotten to\r\nlisten to anything but my own meditation. It is certain that I was\r\nconscious for several moments, in an automatic manner, of a dull,\r\nmonotonous sound, before it reached my notice. At last I seemed abruptly\r\nto recognise that a thud and thud was penetrating the silence. Then I\r\nstarted so quickly toward the direction whence this disturbance arose\r\nthat I all but fell, unsupported as I was by the injured foot. But I\r\npulled myself together and feeling my way, hastened forward as rapidly\r\nas possible, crazed with a new delight. I had recognised the sound.\r\n\r\nIt was Fatty, beating on the drum to affright the Blacks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n                            THE BAMBOO BOMBS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my haste to reach the clearing before that electrifying tom-tom\r\nmelody should cease, I took no account of the distance between the edge\r\nof the wood and the place where I had halted. It was not so far as I had\r\nfeared, however, though it was further than I had any business to have\r\nbeen away from home.\r\n\r\nUpon coming to the slope, I got upon my hands and knees to crawl, for my\r\nankle required rest. The fires were burning brightly in our village, but\r\nthe mist was still weaving thickly about the summit.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned up again among my fellows, like the penny which cannot be\r\nlost, they were nearly knocked dumb with astonishment. Hungry, disgusted\r\nand weary, I limped off to bed as soon as I had indicated the need of\r\nsentries throughout the night. Such a war as this made me snort with\r\ncontempt.\r\n\r\nSometime during the night the fog disappeared, as mysteriously as it had\r\ncome. I had rested badly, having been kept awake by the pain in my foot,\r\nso that I arose before morning and sat by the fire. There, after bathing\r\nthe ankle in water from the spring of brine, I bound it up with strips\r\nof squirrel skin, fastened on with cord made of divided creepers. This\r\ntreatment gave me much relief. The only luck I had in the accident was\r\nthat the sprain was not so serious as my facial contortions (when alone)\r\nmight have indicated to a keen observer.\r\n\r\nThe morning broke clear as glass; one could feel that the day meant to\r\nbe hot before it finished. In our settlement we were all somewhat cross,\r\nfrom lack of food, myself in particular, because this game of starving\r\nus out seemed so nonsensical, and also because my relief expedition had\r\nfizzled out to such a miserable end. I began to be anxious to try\r\nresults with our cunning besiegers. If they delayed the fight for the\r\nday again, I meant to carry the issue into their own headquarters, for\r\nwe had to eat!\r\n\r\nThinking I might enrage them to the point of starting the battle, I\r\ncarried the gold-nugget club from my shelter and planted it, nugget end\r\nuppermost, on our ramparts, directly in line with their camp and the\r\nmine of bombs below. Then I induced old Fatty to beat the drum, while I\r\ngot up on top of the wall and paraded, somewhat after the top-loftical\r\nstyle of the American Indians, beating my breast with my fist, shouting\r\nderisively and pointing with maniacal glee to the gleaming club which we\r\nhad taken, as a token of victory worthily won.\r\n\r\nThis bit of vanity produced an immediate effect, for a score of the\r\nfellows down in the trees appeared from the cover, sufficiently furious\r\nto suit the most exacting mind. They screamed shrilly to express their\r\nwrath, they beat the unoffending earth with their clubs, and they danced\r\nabout as if the soil were hot. Nevertheless they advanced hardly as much\r\nas a stone-toss up the slope, being evidently under some powerful\r\nrestraint. I executed the most aggravating evolutions, limping about on\r\nthe wall, but to no apparent purpose. What was the game which the\r\ncreatures played with such assurance that they could wait with this\r\nremarkable patience? I was angry to think they would not attack; I was\r\nannoyed to be obliged to admit that their warfare threatened to be\r\nsubtle and effective. I hated to be starved into retreat, which would\r\ncertainly be disastrous, or into a charge, down hill, against an ambush,\r\nwhich charge would doubtless prove to be an insupportable calamity.\r\n\r\n“Come up, you cowards!” I bawled in a sneering tone of voice. “Lay on,\r\nyou black McDuffers—we can wipe you off the map!”\r\n\r\nMy only answer was an echo of the cries I had heard the morning before,\r\naway in the jungle. This puzzled me again; it made me impatient. My\r\nLinks had surged about me, wrought to a fine frenzy of excitement, eager\r\nto eat up the whole nation of Blacks—as splendid a pack of starving\r\nwolves as one could find. They also heard the cries, where the enemy\r\nappeared to be scouring through the forest, and I noted that many grew\r\nsilent and worried. They reminded me of animals which have an instinct\r\nthat warns them against the dangers which a human being cannot see nor\r\nfeel.\r\n\r\nThe chief stood a little away, aloof from the others, leaning as ever on\r\nhis club. What a brilliant, coruscating spot was made by the great,\r\ndeadly crystal which he wielded so terribly in the fight! His mate, the\r\nindignant albino, stood beside him, eyeing myself with scorn and hatred.\r\nHer round, pink eyes were as nervous as quicksilver; her whole demeanour\r\nexpressed the jealousy she nourished against me for pushing aside the\r\nchief, and the undisguised desire she felt to avenge herself for my\r\nformer repudiation of her serene regard.\r\n\r\nI gave her only a glance, and to the chief a nod of recognition. Below\r\nme little Tike was looking up in my face; near him old Fatty was\r\nstanding, his quick, bright eyes upon me, his arms akimbo and the\r\nbattered old skull on his head pushed aside, revealing hairless spots\r\nwhere, by rubbing, it had worn the growth off his leather-covered pate.\r\n\r\n“Animals or primitive men—what are you all?” I muttered, and I shook my\r\nhead and gave it up.\r\n\r\nAgain came the concerted cries from the jungle. They were nearer; there\r\nseemed to be a great commotion, not far from the edge of the trees, and\r\nthis appeared to increase with every second. I saw several of my fellows\r\nbegin to edge away, as if to make a run to a place of safety from a foe\r\nmost dread. All the Links were making uneasy sounds, comparable only to\r\nthe whimpering of a frightened dog.\r\n\r\n“Here—come back here. Brace up, you fellows!” I cried to stop the\r\nincipient panic. “Pigs coming—pigs to shoot—pigs to kill!”\r\n\r\nI raised my bow and notched an arrow on the string. I jumped down and\r\nstirred up the fire which must furnish me a brand for the fuses. Then\r\nagain I got on the wall and shouted our defiance to all the jungle-world\r\nabout us. Old Fatty began to beat the drum like a fury.\r\n\r\nMy warriors were inflamed; they crowded forward to see what was\r\nhappening below. By this the cries of the enemy had become shrieks as of\r\nmadness. We saw fifty of the Blacks burst quickly from cover, run to\r\nright and left and dash back in the woods, as if to flank an approaching\r\ncavalcade. To my amazement I saw among the fellows the traitor\r\nGrin—miserable coward! The Links observed him, too, and they chattered\r\ntheir rage and their Link maledictions on his head.\r\n\r\nOnce more I got down, this time to arm myself with a glowing brand from\r\nthe flames. With this I shook out our only banner—a banner of smoke.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the screen of trees, vines and creepers, seemed to bulge toward\r\nus, then to break. Two massive dark chunks of the jungle appeared to be\r\nbursting through. Then I saw what they were and realised what the cries\r\nhad meant, what the plan of the Blacks had been from the first—and what\r\na diabolical and clever scheme it was.\r\n\r\nTwo trumpeting elephants, goaded and maddened, smashed ponderously out\r\nof the jungle and headed up the hill—surrounded and driven toward us by\r\nhundreds of the yelling, dancing devils, with Grin in their midst, all\r\nof them incredibly nimble, daring and wrought up to force their\r\nirresistible allies over and through us.\r\n\r\nThe Links behind me, terrified beyond all control, were too stricken\r\nwith panic to know what to do. They fell headlong over and upon each\r\nother; they ran in every direction. Females and children cried out in\r\nfear; chief, fighters, all were seized in the maelstrom of fright, and\r\nall went dashing away. Already we were as good as routed. Flight to the\r\njungle would mean separation, death of all who were lost and murder of\r\nall who were overtaken by the terrible Blacks.\r\n\r\nConfused for a moment, I attempted to call them back, to restore the\r\norder. This was worse than useless.\r\n\r\nThe elephants came unwillingly up the hill; the din of voices and\r\ntrumpeting was appalling to hear. I jumped from my place, unconscious of\r\nmy wounded foot and dashed down the hill as if to meet this oncoming\r\ntumult of death alone—racing toward my fuses. I had dropped my bow. My\r\nonly weapon was the smoking brand of fire.\r\n\r\nShrieks from the Reds, who could not but see me, and screams of delight\r\nfrom the enemy, greeted the sight of a single crazy man, running down to\r\nthe jaws of this living Juggernaut from the wilds.\r\n\r\nI reached my goal, I fell to my knees and fumbled the matches. The\r\nmonstrous battalion was nearly half way up to the trench of bombs. My\r\nfuses failed to ignite. In desperation I broke off the ends and bore\r\nthem down upon my living coal. My thumb was burned, but I felt nothing.\r\nA fierce hiss from the powder electrified my every fibre. I leaped to my\r\nfeet and darted part way back to the wall.\r\n\r\n“Man,” came the cry of a sweet small voice.\r\n\r\nTurning, I saw that my little Tike had followed me down the slope to the\r\nfuses. There he sat beside them—and the serpents of igniting powder were\r\nracing down to the mines, and the thundering horde of foes was racing\r\nupward, toward the little chap and me. Insanely I ran with all my might\r\nto rescue my only loyal Link—the baby who sat in the sunlight.\r\n\r\nHow far away he was! What a time it seemed to take me to reach him! The\r\nelephants—how near and awful they looked! I could see their\r\nwhite-showing eyes. The monsters began to gallop upward, mad to wreak\r\nvengeance on something, for that goading behind their backs. The yells\r\nbecame a din. Already the brutes must be past my trench. It would\r\nfail—it would kill little Tike and myself—anything but the terrible\r\ncreatures pounding the earth as they came upon us!\r\n\r\nI snatched the little fellow up and ran desperately away. Would nothing\r\never happen? I fell—the ankle had gone at the critical moment. I rolled\r\nand saw the dread spectacle crowding up and up the sun-lit hill.\r\n\r\nThen the earth was rent wide open—great castles of earth and elephants\r\nrose toppling in the air, along with a glare of red-and-yellow flames\r\nand a mighty volcano of smoke. The world belched forth a detonation like\r\nthe crack of doom.\r\n\r\nAnother and yet another fearful fan of fire leaped exultantly upward,\r\nhurling Blacks and fragments of Blacks, and soil and rock that blew\r\nthrough the bellies of the elephants and shot away in every direction\r\ntoward the tranquil sky.\r\n\r\nI was deaf with the mighty roar and concussion. From the air the debris\r\ncame raining down. The smoke seemed a fountain of enveloping fog.\r\nShrieks—now of terror and dreadful pain—stabbed through the confusion.\r\nThen a rock whirred down so close to my head that it puffed me with its\r\ncushion of air. I heard a sound and looked for little Tike, whom I had\r\npermitted to slip to the ground as I fell.\r\n\r\nHe was there beside me, his steady, wistful eyes looking up in my face,\r\nhis poor little legs fairly crushed into the earth, beneath that\r\nfragment of adamant, torn from its bed and hurled upon him.\r\n\r\nI was over him instantly heaving away the hunk of stone. But I did not\r\nattempt to lift the little mangled body. I saw he was numbed by the\r\nshock; I knew he was dying. He lay there and smiled, as I bent above his\r\ntiny form. He made no motion with hand or head, but when I placed my\r\nfinger in his wee palm, he closed his baby-like grip upon it and gave me\r\nthe fondest look I have ever beheld.\r\n\r\nThe Blacks could have swooped upon me, the earth could have quivered\r\nwith agony and death, but I should have known nothing of it all, nor\r\nhave cared. All the pangs of wrenched affection darted through my\r\nbreast. I was smitten dumb to see that human look of love, gratitude and\r\nhope. The homely little face became transfigured with a look of inward\r\nbeauty; the promise of a dawning, evolving human being was there,\r\nglowing like the life in a spark. The wistful eyes burned with that\r\nsingular light which makes us hope for things supernal.\r\n\r\nOn my finger the tiny grip fluttered. I felt myself breaking down like a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nThe little chap’s lip quivered a second; his fleeting breath came forth\r\nlightly.\r\n\r\n“Man,” he whispered in the stillness, and smiling, closed his tired\r\nlittle eyes—forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n                              KING AT LAST\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a cloud over my heart; there was a pall of smoke and fumes\r\ndrawing slowly off from the scene of devastation. It seemed as if the\r\nchasm in the hill-side were a ghastly wound of colossal proportions, for\r\nnot only was the earth torn raggedly, but blood was about, and the slope\r\nwas strewn with mangled remains.\r\n\r\nI felt no exultation; I was ill at the sight, and weak and quite\r\nsubdued. It was a pitiful, dreadful picture, with the two elephants like\r\nmounds of butchery, looming large in the middle distance, while down\r\nbelow were numerous wounded creatures creeping away toward the jungle.\r\nAnd the dying made sounds of moaning.\r\n\r\nNot far from where I had fallen, lay part of a long, red arm—Grin’s. The\r\nbombs had flung it nearly to the camp he had sought to betray. He must\r\nhave been among the foremost of the Links who drove the elephants up the\r\nhill. I conjured back my vision of the charging force, at the second\r\nwhen the explosion created its havoc. I remembered the huge wild animals\r\nmost distinctly, their trunks uplifted, their feet in awkward, active\r\nmotion, while to right and left and almost on their heels, the Blacks\r\nsurged up in their dance of death. I knew then that the destruction\r\namong them must have been tremendous, for the whole length of the trench\r\nhad been covered thickly by their numbers, and the lateral force of the\r\nbursting mines, especially down the hill, had evidently swept the slope\r\nfor rods.\r\n\r\nI shook my head as I realised the narrowness of my own escape.\r\n\r\nI believe I was saved only by a sort of half shoulder of the hill and\r\nthe fact that I fell and was flat on my side when the explosion\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nIn my brain a panorama of all the tragedy ran, time after time. It\r\nseemed unbelievable that the Blacks had been able to drive the\r\nelephants. I shall never cease to wonder at this remarkable performance,\r\nfor everything I know of the jungle’s greatest brute leads me always to\r\nsuppose they would turn upon their pigmy tormentors and drive them away\r\nin confusion, no matter how great their numbers. But more incredible\r\nthan even this was the sudden blotting out of all that mad stampede. I\r\nfelt like the last man left on earth.\r\n\r\nIt was quite impossible for me to go down that dread slope as yet. I sat\r\non the ground, dejected, weak from hunger and the strain of all the\r\nexcitement. I rested my chin in my hand and gazed off abstractedly\r\ntoward the endless sea of green. I lost all interest in the world about\r\nme, for all my memories and all my dreams had conveyed me afar from that\r\nisland of singular fates. At length I was aroused from my reverie by\r\nFatty, who came furtively down from the village and crawled in front of\r\nmy feet, to gaze in my face, with his comical, quizzical expression of\r\ndeep anxiety spread thickly on his homely phiz.\r\n\r\n“Hullo,” said I, “did you come back at last to twist the enemy’s tail?”\r\n\r\nThen I saw an amazing line of heads above the wall, where dozens of our\r\nfellows were peering down upon the scene and upon myself. On their faces\r\nI noted every conceivable look of awe and horror. That I sat there,\r\nseemingly calm after all of that day’s fatal work, impressed them a\r\nthousand fold more than as if I had strutted and boasted of the deed.\r\nPerhaps my face betrayed a certain look of grimness, which events had\r\ncompelled in my thoughts; howbeit the creatures were stricken with an\r\noverpowering dread of my presence.\r\n\r\nThe hill-shaking explosion had been infinitely more terrific than my\r\nfirst little celebration with a single bomb, and this had given them all\r\na fright, the memory of which could never be eradicated from their\r\nminds. But if this had rendered them respectful toward me as the\r\nactuating spirit of it all, the sight of the slope simply drowned them\r\nin fathomless awe. The mightiest creatures of the jungle, torn apart\r\nlike things of paper, the hill split open and altered, a yelling army\r\nscattered and blown to atoms—this sum of deeds appalled them so\r\nthoroughly that the strongest might have died of shock had I jabbed him\r\nin the ribs with my thumb.\r\n\r\nFatty, on seeing that I lived, began to grovel on his face and to push\r\nhis head against the soil where my feet had rested, as if he were quite\r\nunfit to abide on the surface of my earth and would therefore worm and\r\nbore his way down and out of sight without further ado.\r\n\r\nOne after another, then, the trembling fellows came crawling down the\r\nhill, many on their stomachs, to adore my tracks, to wriggle about my\r\nfeet and otherwise to endeavour to calm me down and humble themselves in\r\nmy exalted shadow. Even the chief came toward me on hands and knees,\r\ndragging his club and afraid to lift his head. His downfall was\r\ncomplete; there were none more thoroughly overwhelmed than he. On the\r\nground before me the fellow laid his great crystal weapon—at once his\r\nsceptre and his sword—and he, too, adored the turf where my feet had\r\ntrod. The women, with the albino among them, and even the children, got\r\non the ground, prostrate, abject and afraid.\r\n\r\n“Ahem, really, fellow citizens,” said I with a grin, “your attentions\r\nquite overcome me. Pray excuse my unseemly emotion and blushes.”\r\n\r\nI had conducted a large experiment with some success, yet I felt that my\r\nefforts had been far from superhuman, and not even carried out with\r\nwholly unselfish motives. I felt in fact that the whole present\r\nproposition bordered on the lines of comic opera, for I knew that by the\r\ntoken of the chiefs submission I stood there at last, the King of the\r\nMissing Links!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n                            A MOMENT OF REST\r\n\r\n\r\nWe held a mighty funeral-carnival. The heat made it necessary to rush\r\nthis matter as much as possible. My Links took no little of the meat of\r\nthe slaughtered elephants, but as soon as all were fed again I set them\r\nto work deepening the cavern which the mines had excavated in the hill.\r\n\r\nWith creepers for ropes and with rollers to render the task more easy,\r\nwe dragged the huge carcasses into the graves by sheer force of numbers.\r\nCollecting the Blacks was a most unpleasant labour, but it had to be\r\ndone thoroughly, and it was, although my subjects had never before\r\nperformed such an office for enemies of any description. Oddly enough we\r\nwere quite unable to discover the body of Grin.\r\n\r\nIn the pits I had several great fires ignited, to cremate as much as\r\npossible of the flesh, after which the earth was thrown in and heaped up\r\nuntil I was sure that the shallowest portion of the grave was covered\r\nwith at least ten feet of soil.\r\n\r\nI could have rested with a very good grace after all this business of\r\nwar, but I remembered my former plans and the bear-skin waiting to be\r\ntanned, in the boat. I feared the pelt might be ruined already, and\r\ntherefore I took the earliest opportunity of visiting my lake\r\npossessions. When I came in sight of the boat, I had reason to be glad\r\nthat I had moored her away from the bank, for I found abundant evidence\r\nthat the Blacks had been there, undoubtedly intent on doing mischief.\r\nFortunately for me their dread of the water had proved greater than\r\ntheir desire to destroy the boat, and their ingenuity had shown itself\r\ndeficient when they faced the problem of getting the craft ashore\r\nwithout wetting their precious feet. But they had thrown every available\r\nrock at the innocent craft, together with all the loose pieces of burnt\r\nclay.\r\n\r\nThanks to the covering of clay and leaves, which permitted a slight\r\ncirculation of air, while it kept out investigative insects, the skin\r\nwas in excellent condition. Indeed I am inclined to believe the delay\r\nhad been actually beneficial in the curing process. The thing was\r\npliable and as sweet as a hide could possibly be—which, by the way, is\r\nnot extravagant praise. I had rowed away, out of sight of my loyal\r\nsubjects, before uncovering my treasure. Floating on the calm surface of\r\nthe lake I worked at the pelt most arduously. Nearly the whole of that\r\nday I was rubbing it, scrubbing the parts together and otherwise keeping\r\nit soft, while the sun and the air dried out the moisture which made it\r\nheavy and “green.”\r\n\r\nWhen I was finally ready to call it finished, the hide was much like a\r\nsoft, thick robe, such as is commonly employed for a rug, a condition\r\nwhich I knew would be permanent, although in a spot or two the thing\r\nmight be inclined to stiffen. I packed it again in leaves merely to hide\r\nit from sight and proceeded back to our beach, where I anchored the boat\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as I felt that my actual duties were now performed, I\r\ndetermined to rest for a space and enjoy the peace which we had\r\ncompelled so abruptly. I therefore lay about the camp the following\r\nmorning, doing absolutely nothing to “earn my salt.” Now and again I\r\ncaught myself feeling or looking about. There was no little Tike. When I\r\ndozed I fancied I heard his voice, but on starting awake found nothing\r\nbeside me but faithful old Fatty, who always poked his forehead on the\r\nground as soon as he saw me looking upon him. Someway the camp seemed\r\nnot itself. I got no enjoyment from my streak of laziness, and I got but\r\nlittle rest. It did me good to carve a bit of a board, or section of\r\nbamboo, with the inscription:\r\n\r\n                             “LITTLE MAN.”\r\n\r\nThis I planted in the mound of rocks where the tiny chap was buried.\r\n\r\nThe settlement, I thought, would never be the same to me again,\r\nespecially now that I was king. My Links were far too conscious of my\r\nregal attributes; there was less of the feeling of fellowship than we\r\nhad enjoyed before. I had failed to appreciate our previous social\r\nequality, but now that all were rendered so timid and humbled in my\r\npresence, I was bored and somewhat annoyed. The crystal club I kept in\r\nmy shelter, beside the one of the gleaming nugget. Though he seemed, now\r\nand again, to eye me somewhat sullenly and to gaze on the weapon with a\r\nhungering expression of countenance, the ex-chief made himself an\r\nexcellent new bludgeon, with a rock at the end, which was twice the\r\nweight of any other similarly employed in the place.\r\n\r\nThe fellow accepted a bow and a lot of arrows readily enough. We hunted\r\nas before, employing these excellent weapons. Some of the creatures had\r\nlearned by this time to shoot with great force and precision. One sent\r\nan arrow entirely through the belly of a hog, on one of our many\r\nexcursions to the jungle.\r\n\r\nIn a leisurely manner I provided myself with cord and sundry requisites\r\nfor masquerading as a bear. Before my rest was two days old I was weary\r\nof it and restless to be again actively engaged. Once more the malady of\r\ndislike for all the Links and their camp had broken out within me,\r\nwherefore I desired to hasten matters in regard to my unknown friend, on\r\nwhose rescue I was fully determined.\r\n\r\nI began to wonder why I had delayed this important matter for a moment.\r\nI was eager to see this man, grasp his hand and hear him speak the\r\nlanguage so long denied my ears. Why, if he were half a man, we two\r\ncould accomplish anything—everything! Why had I not hastened to reach\r\nhim and to get him away while the Blacks were still demoralised by the\r\nrecent extermination of more than half their number? I would dally no\r\nlonger; I would act at once.\r\n\r\nIn order to proceed with intelligence I had need to formulate my plan.\r\nWhat should I do? Do?—I would simply row my boat to Outlet river, dress\r\nmyself in the bear-skin suit and waddle into the settlement to make my\r\nobservations. This sounded simple enough, but reason told me I should\r\nblunder no little as a bear and appear none too real in the role. I must\r\npractice, I thought as my first sane conclusion, but my second was still\r\nmore rational—I would work the trick in semi-darkness only, when my\r\nfeatures would be rendered somewhat indefinite by the shadows. Should I\r\ngo there in the early morning, or should I try the game in the twilight\r\nof evening? In the morning, I meditated, the light increases rapidly,\r\nand my man might be asleep; daylight could readily overtake me while I\r\nwas crawling about to get my bearings. Clearly the evening would be the\r\nbetter time.\r\n\r\nWell, then, the sooner the business began the sooner I should know what\r\nwas what. I decided to be present in the camp of the Blacks that very\r\nday, when the sun should have disappeared behind the hills.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXV\r\n                             A FELLOW HUMAN\r\n\r\n\r\nGreatly relieved to have something to do—something which might be about\r\nto furnish a turning point in all this unnatural existence of mine in\r\nthe wilds, I set off for the boat at an early hour of the afternoon.\r\nOnce started on the expedition, I was in a fever of haste to be about it\r\nand to try my new conclusions with fortune.\r\n\r\nThe skull of the bear had been boiled free of everything suggesting\r\nmeat. When a mile away, down the lake I replaced this heavy thing in the\r\nskin and sewed the hide roughly about it to give the head a natural\r\nappearance. Then along the edges where I had been obliged to cut the\r\npelt to get it off, I made a series of holes, into which I laced the\r\ncords, provided for the purpose, intending to draw them tight when the\r\ncostume was properly adjusted about me.\r\n\r\nHaving nothing more to prepare, I rowed leisurely for two hours, when I\r\nwent ashore, near the mouth of the outlet, and tried my disguise. This\r\nbusiness discouraged me greatly. I was able to get the neck portion\r\nfastened about my head, in such a manner that I could see easily, and\r\nthe body of the skin about my chest and waist, but my arms and legs were\r\ntoo long for the paws and legs of the bear, while the body part was\r\nlonger than my trunk. Altogether I was about the most extraordinary\r\nlooking freak to be found in the jungle, when I had done my utmost to\r\nmake the costume fit.\r\n\r\nI should quite have appreciated the use of several mirrors at this stage\r\nof my make-up, in order to see if sundry portions were on straight, but\r\nwas denied this pleasure, having failed to provide myself with various\r\narticles of the toilet. It was only by crawling and lolling about on the\r\nground, on knees and elbows that I was enabled to convince myself that I\r\nlooked the slightest bit like the creature whose part I had essayed to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nI have never felt more warm in my life than I did in that skin. The day\r\nwas hot, the hide was heavy, and I had laboured hard to get it on. The\r\nperspiration threatened to make the pelt insupportable. But now that I\r\nhad myself fastened inside it, I dreaded the task of taking it off and\r\nputting it on again later. As an outcome of much agitated mental debate,\r\nI decided to be a bear until my work as a spy was concluded. I therefore\r\nsat me down, in the shade, near my boat, and waited for sunset.\r\n\r\nThe sun becomes very deliberate, I found, when it catches a man in a\r\ntight, hot place. It seemed as if the fiery ball intended to hang in the\r\nwestern sky for several centuries, for my particular delectation. At\r\nlast it got weary of the game and departed.\r\n\r\nA bear can perform several feats with comfort and ease to himself and\r\nwith grace, perhaps, but rowing a boat is not among the number. I grew\r\nhotter, in several ways, directly. I think I wished fervently that my\r\nunknown friend, the prisoner, had never committed the indiscretion of\r\nbeing captured by the Blacks. It being necessary to proceed with\r\ncaution, my torture was much prolonged. At length, however, I noted a\r\nsnug retreat in which my boat could remain, undetected, and which I\r\nhoped would be readily accessible from the camp I was searching in the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nAlready the shadows had begun to be deep, so that I walked erect, in\r\nwhat I thought to be the right direction, moving with the greatest care,\r\nand alert every second for the smallest sound. I had made my way for a\r\nconsiderable distance in this manner, without being able to detect any\r\ndisturbance in the forest, when presently a low rumble, as of something\r\nrolling over stones, beneath a muffling canopy, broke on the air. This\r\nsound increased. It seemed to come from a source not far away, and yet\r\nit was most uncertain and elusive. I was quite at a loss to determine\r\nwhence it proceeded. Growing stronger it made a great ado of grumbling,\r\nreaching a sort of climax in less than a minute, after which it slowly\r\nsubsided and was gone.\r\n\r\nStanding where I was, I listened attentively, for the noise had puzzled\r\nme much. Then through the silence came another sound, which anyone could\r\nhave understood, anywhere on earth. It was a moan. A second later I\r\nheard the rustle of leaves and saw a prowling form—one of the ebon\r\nLinks.\r\n\r\nFalling upon my hands and knees, noiselessly, I waited for the fellow to\r\npass from sight and hearing, after which I crawled laboriously forward,\r\nnearing the sound where something was voicing its pain. My heart was\r\nbeating so tumultuously that I felt obliged to halt frequently, in order\r\nto calm myself as much as the perilous situation would permit. Moving\r\nthus and keeping constantly in the cover of the vines and grasses, I\r\nglanced about me keenly.\r\n\r\nWhen I came upon the clearing in which the Blacks abided, it happened so\r\nabruptly that I started, to find myself so near. Lying out full length,\r\nI endeavoured to quiet the thumping of my heart and to moisten my mouth,\r\nwhich had become dry and gluey. Then I looked about, through the\r\nfriendly screen of creepers.\r\n\r\nThe shadows lay thick enough for all purposes, yet there was light\r\nenough to reveal several incongruous things. First I noted a dozen or\r\nmore of the black Links, some of them moving about, some squatting on\r\nthe ground, monkey-fashion, eating mangoes and melons, one lying flat on\r\nhis back in the agony of death. He it was that moaned; he had received\r\nhis mortal wounds in the great explosion. I saw that his arm was gone,\r\nand then I knew him—Grin.\r\n\r\nAt the back of the clearing was a wall of rock. In front of this stood a\r\nnatural pillar of stone, and fastened up at the top was something which\r\nfor a time presented the greatest mystery. It looked like portions of a\r\nskeleton, disconnected, but it gleamed, even in the twilight. I studied\r\nit closely for the thing compelled my undivided attention. Then I saw\r\nthe skull and knew it had all been, upon a time, the frame work of a\r\nliving creature, but astonishing fact of all things weird—it was plated\r\nall over with something precisely resembling gold!\r\n\r\nI forgot the Links; I forgot my mission to their village. That skeleton\r\ncentered my every thought. I studied it, patched it together mentally,\r\nand attempted to picture it properly straightened out. This process\r\nconvinced me at once that the arms were shorter than those of any Link,\r\nwhile the skull was finely formed on the human pattern. I observed that\r\nthe whole thing, if properly articulated would be taller than I. The\r\nLinks, I told myself, cared nothing for the bones of their kind, and\r\nless for those of their foes. It must be—it had to be the skeleton of a\r\nman!\r\n\r\nBut the gold—or whatever it was,—the plating, how came it on the skull\r\nand on those ribs, those bones of the arms and thighs and all the rest?\r\nWhy was it here? Immediately my brain jumped to the preposterous\r\nconclusion that my “friend,” the man I had come to save, had been killed\r\nsince my former visit, his skeleton plated with something and strung up\r\nhere on the rock to please some strange whims of these incomprehensible\r\ncreatures. I knew, a second later, that this was absurd. My mental\r\nprocess as quickly formed a saner theory. This man had lived among the\r\nBlacks before; they had learned of him—which accounted for many\r\nthings,—like their superiority over my Reds,—they had killed him, later,\r\nand by some singular accident this appearance of plating had come to\r\npass on the bones.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of my conjectures, that weird, low rumble commenced again,\r\nnearer at hand, but still in some locality invisible from where I was.\r\nCrouching, while its mighty tones increased, several Blacks glanced\r\nupward at the skeleton and then put their heads upon the ground in\r\nadoration before the pillar of stone.\r\n\r\nI nearly cried out as I suddenly grasped at a wonderful thought. That\r\nrumbling—it was certainly a sound I had heard before that day—it\r\ncertainly must be that marvellous cauldron of gold, where the geyser\r\nshot upward and boiled in its cavern. The plated skeleton had received\r\nits plating there; the nugget of gold at the end of the club which a\r\nBlack had wielded in war, had come from there; the cavern which I and\r\nold Fatty had seen, on the day we fled in the subterranean passage, was\r\nthere; and these creatures owned it and evidently knew of an opening\r\nleading to its wondrous interior from the outside world!\r\n\r\nWhat was I about to discover? What was here, in and about this\r\nremarkable camp? Would I see it all?—would I get a chance to investigate\r\nthe wonderful cave? Could I rob that cauldron of its treasure? I was\r\nwild with excitement. I wished that I had an overwhelming army behind\r\nme—a force sufficient to drive these creatures anywhere, away in the\r\njungle. I looked about, as if to see my army. Great Scott! I had utterly\r\nforgotten how alone I was! The wretches might discover me, know me and\r\nbeat me to jelly in a second. My breath came hard; I remembered my\r\nbusiness in a manner painfully vivid.\r\n\r\nI must go ahead, for obviously there was nothing here for me, nothing of\r\nthat partner I had come to steal. He must be off, where a pair of Blacks\r\nwere walking as I looked. Still keeping in the cover, I edged about the\r\nclearing and pushed ahead. A tangled isthmus of greenery divided the\r\nsmall open space from another which was considerably larger. In a brief\r\ntime I came in sight of this and beheld another remarkable sight.\r\n\r\nAt the foot of a towering cliff of rocks, surrounded by fruit trees on\r\nthe left, the river down in front, and the isthmus of trees and vines in\r\nwhich I was lying on the right, was a fine flat space, commodious,\r\nstrategically situated and now alive with black Missing Links. Our\r\nexplosion had killed the fighters by the score, but the females and\r\nchildren were exceedingly numerous, while of males there were still\r\nalmost as many as we had in all our tribe.\r\n\r\nThat once the creatures had been directed by a man was plain, for here\r\nwere a score of dugouts, such as we possessed, but the roofs were gone\r\nfrom many, while those of the others showed every sign of neglect and\r\nthe rapid deterioration into which it seemed as if the creatures must\r\nfall, and let everything fall, when abandoned to themselves. Of any\r\nweapons which they might have possessed in the “age” of that man, there\r\nwas not the slightest sign. Looking carefully about, I saw but one\r\nshelter on which the roof appeared to be intact. This one was near the\r\nbase of the cliff, on the left-hand side of the clearing, from me; that\r\nis to say, the same side on which I was now concealed.\r\n\r\nThe light was growing dim. I peered about, in a vain endeavour to see\r\n“my man.” How I wished I might raise my voice and cry out a greeting—a\r\nsomething which would tell this other human being of my nearness! It is\r\nunbelievable how strong was the impulse to commit this indiscretion. I\r\ncurbed the desire, however, and waited to see if anything would happen.\r\n\r\nHere and there, on the campus, the evening fires of the Links were being\r\nkindled, from a “mother” fire smouldering in a natural hollow beneath\r\nthe wall of rock. I could see what I thought were the ruins of a more\r\nconvenient fireplace, near the central fire. It looked as if that former\r\nman had provided a means for a better culinary output, but that the\r\ncreatures had soon gone back to their own original methods, when he was\r\ndead. Then I thought that things were peculiar, for why were there no\r\nmaterial evidences of the presence of the man I had come to seek, about\r\nthe camp? What was the matter with this unseen individual? He must be\r\nweak indeed to do absolutely nothing!\r\n\r\nI remembered his spouting of poetry, and I fear my estimation of a man\r\nwho would give himself over to such effeminate employment as that was of\r\nprecious little account. Poetry indeed! He was evidently a lady’s man\r\nfor his voice had sounded soft and here was proof that he either could\r\nnot, or was not willing to, manufacture the very first thing, either for\r\ncooking, living or fighting. Perhaps such a fellow was hardly worth the\r\nrisk; perhaps I should be wise to retreat, in good order, and let him\r\nwork out his own salvation.\r\n\r\nMy attention was caught, as I scanned the place in this critical frame\r\nof mind, by a flutter of something, near the only decent shelter.\r\n\r\n“Upon my word,” I muttered in huge contempt, “I believe the fellow has\r\ngot out his washing on a line!”\r\n\r\nAbout that moment a bird in the tree above me made a sound like a boy\r\nwhistling. This was my cue. If any man were anywhere about, he would\r\nhear a whistle—and the Links would have no suspicion. I piped up on the\r\nopening bar of “Yankee Doodle.” This I repeated time after time. It\r\nappeared as if the scheme would turn out worthless, as it produced no\r\napparent effect. Growing more bold, I started to whistle my lay a trifle\r\nlouder, but I chopped it off short in the middle, for I beheld a figure\r\nemerge from the decent dug-out and start slowly toward me, walking and\r\nperforming some singular weaving motions with the arms.\r\n\r\nThe dusk had gathered over the scene, yet I saw that this was a white\r\nhuman being!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n                         SURPRISE AND SUSPENSE\r\n\r\n\r\nI held my breath, I shivered with sudden excitement.\r\n\r\nThe figure, slight, beautifully erect, clothed in a skirt-like garment\r\nof skins, came nearer and nearer. I was so thoroughly intent on seeing\r\nwhy the arms were moved in those singular gestures that I clean forgot\r\nto scan the face.\r\n\r\nThe stranger came closer, followed now by scores of the Blacks, who\r\nadored and worshipped in the tracks which were left by the feet. I could\r\nsee the heavy coils of some ornament about the neck and over the slender\r\nshoulders of this human. Suddenly I knew what the hands were doing;\r\nsuddenly the most astounding intelligence broke on my brain.\r\n\r\nThe figure was that of a woman, young, beautiful, clad like Diana, and\r\nthe coils about her maidenly form were those of a monster serpent, the\r\nhead of which she held in her hand while with the other she gently\r\nunwound the wrappings of the tail.\r\n\r\nI whistled again, more softly, my excitement growing at every second.\r\n\r\nOn she came, uncertainly, down along the edge of that open cage in the\r\njungle, her head held finely in a listening poise, her face white, set\r\nand smileless. She moved like a goddess in a dream. In her eyes burned a\r\nhalf-wild light of anxiety; on her lips there was a tense look of\r\nsuppressed emotion. Her beautiful arms seemed marble-white, as they\r\nmoved in those snake-soothing gestures; her whole deportment was that of\r\none who questions, yearns eagerly for a sign on which to build a hope,\r\nbut dares not believe that a cruel fate could possibly relent.\r\n\r\nShe was almost opposite where I was lying. I knew I should speak to\r\nher—do something instantly, before the moment should be gone, but my\r\ntongue now cleaved fast to its sheath in my mouth, my teeth clenched\r\nhard together and my muscles were all but paralysed at that fateful\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nShe was just before me—passing me by—in reach of the slightest sound.\r\n\r\n“Who is it?” she said aloud, in a voice that trembled.\r\n\r\n“It’s me—a man,” I whispered with ungrammatical suddenness, “Don’t\r\nstop—you’ll betray me—Come to-night!”\r\n\r\nHalf prepared as she was, she still started violently. She loosened her\r\nhold on the head of the snake. The horrible thing wrapped itself about\r\nher arm and tightened all its coils. Hastily clutching the serpent by\r\nthe neck again, she twisted and choked it into submission. Her eyes were\r\nablaze with fear and a wild, unbelieving hope! How luminous they were,\r\neven in the meagre light! What a wondering, beseeching face she\r\nrevealed, as she turned for a second in her instinctive effort to see\r\nwhere I was!\r\n\r\nAs she had mastered the snake, so she mastered the womanly instinct to\r\ncry out and dash to the spot where I lay. I saw her weave slightly, as\r\nshe recovered her poise, after which she resumed her singular march\r\ntoward the river.\r\n\r\nThe Blacks came to where she had paused, adoring the trail so near me\r\nthat I could hear them breathing. What hideous brutes they were, now\r\nthat I had seen a beautiful human being! They passed, and I longed to\r\nleap upon their backs and strike them all to death.\r\n\r\nAll about that clearing the goddess-like prisoner led the creatures who\r\nhad made her captive. She was almost lost to sight in the darkness which\r\nwas now enveloping the wood. She was only the faint suggestion of a form\r\nwhen at last I saw her pass again inside her shelter.\r\n\r\nI loosened a thousand tense muscles the second she disappeared, and lay\r\nlimber and all unstrung on the earth. I had not been seen by any Links.\r\nIt had perhaps been foolish and a waste of time to kill the bear and\r\nadopt his hide after all. But it had given me the courage to come—and\r\ngreat Heavens! what a find I had made!\r\n\r\nA woman!—among these monsters! No wonder there were no new houses, no\r\novens, no weapons of war of her making. I had been profoundly stupid. I\r\nshould have been able to guess it was not a man—that soft, clear voice,\r\nthe absence of mannish contrivances, and then that suggestive little\r\nline of her washing—these should have been enough to tell me the story.\r\nA woman—a helpless, beautiful woman—and I had almost thought of giving\r\nup the effort to rescue this friend!—this fellow human!\r\n\r\n“Gee whizz!” said I to myself, for the thing was tremendous.\r\n\r\nThen I wondered what would happen next. Would she come—return to the\r\nplace where she had heard my voice? Would she wait till all the Links\r\nwere safely asleep and then place her trust in a stranger? At what time\r\nwere these black beasts likely to retire? Would they wake and catch her\r\nin the act? Could we find my boat in the dark? But everything else was\r\nas nothing compared to the question, which I repeated over and over,\r\nwould she come?\r\n\r\nI believed she would. I intended to wait, whatever might occur, and to\r\nwait until morning, if she did not sooner appear. A thousand times I\r\nwished we were already in my boat and away on the lake.\r\n\r\n“All these days gone to waste for a bear-skin,” I muttered, “and all the\r\ntime it was easy to sneak into their place under their very noses.”\r\n\r\nI was glad now, however, of the warmth of the skin, for the ground was\r\nmoist. In the clearing the night had descended like a curtain, but five\r\nor six fires somewhat illumined the place. The scene presented was\r\nstrange. About the centres of ruddy light were groups of these weird,\r\nsemi-human creatures, standing and squatting, eating like so many apes.\r\nTheir long, thin arms made their appearance most grotesque, silhouetted\r\nas they were against the light. Here and there the red glow lighted up a\r\nnegro-gorilla countenance, flat-nosed, big-jawed and large-eared, till\r\nit seemed like a region where the imps of darkness breed. And back of\r\nall this, the play of the flames threw monster shadows, on the\r\nbackground of trees and creepers, till it all had a strange appearance\r\nof life, as if incredible snakes and incongruous animals weaved an\r\nendless woof of mystery into the warp of night.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed and I had hardly moved. By groups the creatures slunk\r\naway to their huddling places. The groans of many wounded, unnoted\r\nbefore in the chatter, arose to chorus with the distant sounds of the\r\njungle. Regularly, like a marker of time, came the rumble and grumble\r\nfrom the cauldron of gold.\r\n\r\nAround the largest fire, a grim old warrior hovered for an interminable\r\ntime, after all the others had departed. I had no patience with his\r\npretence of cogitating over all the problems of the universe; I wished\r\nhim safely abed and snoring. He pothered about for an age, and finally\r\nstretched himself near the embers and went to sleep.\r\n\r\nI waited and waited, expecting every moment to be rewarded by a vision\r\nof the prisoner, gliding toward me. The moon arose above the trees\r\nbehind me and made the place altogether too bright for any good. To\r\nallay my impatience I watched the matchless orb sailing above the\r\njungle. Turning at last from the brilliant picture, my heart leaped\r\nwildly. The goddess was almost there!\r\n\r\nSlipping quickly, but noiselessly forth, I emerged from the vines on\r\nhands and knees and started to arise.\r\n\r\nThe girl gave a scream and fled like a startled doe.\r\n\r\n“Don’t be scared,” I half shouted, guardedly, “it’s only a skin,” but my\r\nassurance was then too late.\r\n\r\nOn the instant the Blacks bounded up, alert and alarmed. Club in hand,\r\nthe grim old fighter near the fire came running toward me. The shadows\r\nwere with us, by great good fortune. The girl, moreover, had the\r\npresence of mind to disappear in the trees and emerge further up toward\r\nher shelter.\r\n\r\nRealising that now or never I must act my part, I fell on all fours like\r\na plummet. Browsing about unconcernedly, I moved a little in the grass\r\nat the edge of the growth, and then, having made myself sure that I had\r\nbeen seen by the Links who came dashing excitedly up, I slowly rooted\r\nback into the thicket and disappeared.\r\n\r\nIt worked like magic. Chattering a lot of drivel which was plainly\r\neulogistic of all the bear family and congratulatory to all the black\r\nLinks in existence—who had thus been honoured in the night—the savages\r\nkow-towed on the ground and otherwise wrote themselves down as\r\nunmitigated asses for a longer period by far than they need have done\r\nfor my satisfaction. Indeed it began to look as if they had taken a\r\nnotion to spend the remainder of the night in adoration of the ground I\r\nhad condescended to spurn with my hands and knees. When at last I heard\r\nthem go, I crept silently back to the edge of the growth and watched\r\nthem stir up the fire and blunder off to bed.\r\n\r\n“Confound the skin!” I muttered to myself. “Why didn’t I tell her what a\r\nbeastly old bear I am?”\r\n\r\nSuch a time now went by that I began to fear the girl had missed my\r\nhurried explanation, in her natural fright, when she ran. However, it\r\ndid not seem possible she would give up so easily and be afraid to come.\r\nYet I knew it all depended upon her condition of mind. She had doubtless\r\nbecome more than usually timid while subjected to all that she must have\r\nundergone here among the Links, all alone, and no human being could\r\nentirely eliminate a feeling of dread for the jungle in the dark.\r\n\r\nTrusting that in all the medley of night-sounds, a whistle would not\r\nawaken the Links, I set up my piping on the bar of our Yankee\r\nacquaintance again, repeating it, as before, as often as I deemed it\r\nprudent. More of the endless waiting, in my far from enviable position,\r\nensued. If the moon got another half hour in which to sail before the\r\nprisoner came, she would drive every friendly shadow squarely back to\r\nthe forest.\r\n\r\nI watched till my neck was stiff and my body cramped. “If the goddess\r\ndoesn’t hurry,” I muttered, “the game will be up for the night.” Still\r\nshe lingered in her shelter. I began to grow cross; I vowed she must be\r\ncrimping her hair and putting on a new pair of gloves.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she appeared again, coming out of the trees, not far away. This\r\ntime I whistled, ever so softly. She paused, came silently on a rod, and\r\nhalted as before. Another little whistle brought her almost before me.\r\n\r\n“Now please don’t yell again,” I whispered ungallantly. “Slip into the\r\nwoods as quietly as you can—we’ve got to hurry.”\r\n\r\n“Who is it?” she stopped to answer, below her breath, as I rose to my\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n“It’s just John Nevers, a common, ordinary man—American. If we’re going\r\nto get away, I wish you wouldn’t fool around another minute.”\r\n\r\nI saw that she stood undecided a second, with that evil-looking snake\r\nabout her shoulders; its eyes gleamed like beads in a ray of moonlight\r\nwhich touched on its hateful head. For that brief space of time I felt\r\nsuch a disgust for the serpent and such a growing impatience, that I had\r\na half impulse to trudge away alone. But she moved toward me; the light\r\nwhich had fallen on the head of the snake silvered her pale, beautiful\r\nface. The appeal which was there in her eyes, the trust which was born\r\non the moment, and the helplessness of a maiden, all combined to shame\r\nme and to make me her champion against the terrors of all the world.\r\n\r\n“Come through here,” I whispered, bending back a branch, and she stepped\r\ntoward me, confident and strong in the hope newly kindled in her breast.\r\n\r\nThe branch slipped from my fingers and swished noisily back. I heard a\r\nsnort; the light-sleeping old devil of a Link was up on his feet in a\r\nsecond. He ran toward us again, this time unaccompanied by any of the\r\nothers. We stood there as silent as statues. My knife was out, for I had\r\ninstantly determined to slay this watch-dog of the tribe, if he came a\r\nfoot into the brush.\r\n\r\nHe merely whined about, uneasily, a time, and then returned to his post.\r\nWithout waiting to let him lose himself in sleep, I led and cleared the\r\nway, moving as slowly as a frozen tortoise, for a considerable time,\r\nwhile the goddess followed, as silently as my shadow.\r\n\r\nPast the clearing, where the gilded skeleton hung in the moonlight we\r\nglided. Here I saw the stiffened form of Grin, lying stark on the earth.\r\nThe deep, mysterious rumble of the gold-cauldron began anew.\r\n\r\n“Now hurry, while this racket drowns out all the noise we can make,” I\r\nwhispered.\r\n\r\nWe made no mean bit of progress while the noise continued, after which I\r\nfelt there was no more need of particular care. The jungle thickets were\r\nfearfully dark, as soon as we got away from the clearings, and I was\r\nobliged to forge ahead as best I could, guided only by my sense of\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour went by and although we should have been at the river,\r\nwhere the boat was on the bank, there was no immediate prospect of our\r\ncoming to the proper place. In the midst of my efforts, mental and\r\nphysical, to extricate myself and the girl from the maze, a peculiar\r\nshriek went up in the distance behind us. I paused, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Oh—that is the voice of the horrid old woman,” said the goddess\r\nanxiously. “I think she has found I have gone.”\r\n\r\n“The deuce!” said I. “She has alarmed the whole works, the old villain!”\r\n\r\nJudging by the noise which was raised one would have thought she had\r\nawakened the whole world. I was certain every Link in the camp was up\r\nand dancing about that clearing in the wildest confusion.\r\n\r\n“Come ahead,” said I, calmly enough, “they are all afraid of the woods\r\nat night; they will never catch us now—unless the morning overtakes us\r\nbefore we reach the river.”\r\n\r\nI knew she shuddered, but like a brave, good girl she made no fuss. As\r\nfor the racket, it furnished me with a bearing, as it were. Knowing\r\nwhere their settlement was, I knew the approximate direction in which\r\nthe boat should be found. Indeed before we had travelled another fifty\r\nyards I caught a gleam of reflected moonlight from Outlet river and knew\r\nmy way directly.\r\n\r\n“It’s lucky that beastly old woman didn’t make her discovery sooner,”\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied the trembling voice of the goddess, “that was why I kept\r\nyou waiting so long; she wouldn’t go to sleep.”\r\n\r\n“Um,” was all I muttered. I was thinking about that crimping of her\r\nhair, poor girl, and the putting on of tight, new gloves.\r\n\r\nWe reached the boat, to my intense relief. “Please get in and make\r\nyourself as comfortable as possible,” said I, and ripping off the\r\nbear-skin, I flung it down to make her a seat.\r\n\r\nOut into the limpid stream I shoved my clumsy but beloved craft, and\r\nmanning the oars I swung her about, headed her toward the lake and made\r\nthe liquid silver shiver from the prow.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight fell on the sweet, womanly face. The goddess looked at me\r\ndumbly—almost with the divine expression I had seen on the face of\r\nlittle Tike. Her eyes were eloquent of gratitude, relief and things too\r\ngreat to be expressed. Slowly her head came forward on her breast, away\r\nfrom which she held that ugly serpent, and she sobbed and sobbed like a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\nAh what a night it was! I felt a throb of triumph all through my veins.\r\nRowing steadily and stoutly I said nothing, but let her have her cry. At\r\nlast she looked upon my face again.\r\n\r\n“Where—are we—going?” she faltered.\r\n\r\n“Home,” said I, “to the camp on top of the hill.”\r\n\r\n“Home?” she echoed softly. “To your—people, do you—mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yep,” I agreed. “For a while, at least. But they’re not exactly my\r\npeople. They’re a lot of Missing Links.”\r\n\r\n“Oh—what? Missing Links? You don’t mean things like the horrible\r\ncreatures we have just escaped?”\r\n\r\n“Same species,” I assured her cheerfully, “but mine are red.”\r\n\r\n“Oh—oh,” she moaned with a shudder, “but I’d rather not! Oh I hate them\r\nso; they are all so horrid; they frighten me terribly, and I know they\r\nwill act exactly like the others—”\r\n\r\n“No they won’t,” I interrupted, with a grin, “they’ll get off the earth,\r\nif I say the word, for they know that I am the King!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n                              THE GODDESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pull was a long one, even in the cool of the night. I knew my way,\r\nby the stars, if necessary, but the moonlight made my steering easy.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour the goddess was silent, sighing now and again, and\r\ncrying a bit, as if deliverance had broken down some barrier to all her\r\nemotions, letting floods of pent up feelings free at once.\r\n\r\n“It doesn’t seem possible,” she told me finally.\r\n\r\n“What doesn’t?” said I, though I knew very well what she meant.\r\n\r\n“This boat,” she answered, “and you—a man—in this terrible place. It\r\ndoesn’t seem really true that I have escaped from those awful creatures;\r\nI didn’t believe I should ever get away. Oh, how did you do it?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you’d better tell me first how you got there,” I made answer.\r\n“How long have you been in the place?”\r\n\r\n“I—don’t know,” she faltered. “It must be months and months. I lost all\r\naccount, but it seems like an age. I didn’t seem to care about the\r\ndates, there have been such lots of awful things to think of all the\r\nwhile. What month is it now?”\r\n\r\n“Lord bless you, that’s more than I know,” I admitted shamelessly. “I\r\ncouldn’t keep track; things have been too hot. I should say, though,\r\nit’s probably getting along toward summer.”\r\n\r\nAlthough she was deeply concerned with herself and all the troubles\r\nwhich for long she had endured, she realised that I too had been lost in\r\nthis land of jungle. She made me tell my story first. I boiled it down\r\nto the bones, being anxious to hear how it was she came to be there.\r\nThis she told me, brokenly, before we landed from the boat.\r\n\r\nShe was a cosmopolitan sort of a girl, born and raised in Australia,\r\neducated partially in England and partially in Massachusetts. Her father\r\nwas an Englishman, a scientist, her mother American, of fine old Puritan\r\nstock. This mother had died in Sydney. The father and daughter having\r\nspent much of their time together, had grown to be great companions. She\r\nhad long been interested in all his work, in which she had learned to be\r\nof great assistance. Thus it came about that when he determined to visit\r\ncertain of the smaller Banyac Islands, for the purpose of collecting\r\nflora and fauna for preservation, she accompanied him as a matter of\r\ncourse. From a private steam yacht, placed at the professor’s disposal,\r\nand also from the coast settlements, the two had made daily excursions,\r\nin a ship’s yawl in which they could make a careful survey of all the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nEngaged in their work, one warm afternoon, they had moored the yawl\r\namong a lot of weed-covered rocks. This had been accomplished by\r\nsecuring the painter to one of the oars and wedging this oar down\r\nbetween a pair of boulders. The tide was ebbing when they landed.\r\n\r\nIn a short time her father had secured a medium-sized anaconda, which\r\nhaving recently fed, was dull and half asleep. This serpent he had given\r\nto his daughter, who carried it back to the boat and nailed it in a box\r\nprovided for any such emergency. Feeling slightly fatigued and\r\nunenthusiastic she had then sat down in the yawl, raised her sun-shade\r\nand taken out a book to read.\r\n\r\nShe described the soporific effect of the heat and the lapping of the\r\nwater about the boat, which had begun soon to affect her senses when she\r\nhad settled down to rest. Before she knew it she had gone fast asleep.\r\nShe believed that finally the tide had risen and floated the oar from\r\nbetween the rocks. Then doubtless a breeze had sprung up and the boat\r\nhad been drifted away.\r\n\r\n“Anyway I know I must have slept for hours.” she said, “but when I did\r\nwake up—oh dear! The sky was black, and I couldn’t see any island, or\r\nanything but water, and a terrible storm was coming, and the darkness\r\nwas all about me, and then—well, it was simply the awfullest wind in the\r\nworld that commenced to blow!”\r\n\r\nThe storm which she now described had probably been a regular monsoon.\r\nIt lasted for hours, she said, and the yawl was driven wildly about on\r\nthe angry sea. Like many a yawl, this craft had been broad of beam and\r\nit was therefore as seaworthy as a life-belt. It had ridden like a duck\r\nthroughout the night.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the light returned, the girl had found herself stranded in\r\na singular place. Not a sign could she see of the ocean, but the yawl\r\nhad been driven inland on what had appeared to be a great lagoon. This\r\nwater-way, the edges of which were bordered thickly with a dense,\r\njungle-like growth, had become as calm as a mill-pond.\r\n\r\nWhile she still sat in the boat she had suddenly discovered a score of\r\n“horrid black brutes” descending upon the place. She had found the task\r\nof pushing off to be quite beyond her strength, in addition to which she\r\nhad been so bewildered as not to know in the least where she had\r\narrived. The creatures—the Black Missing Links—had appeared of\r\nthreatening aspect, yet she had soon been made to realise that they were\r\ndelighted to see her among them and that all regarded herself as a prize\r\nbelonging to the tribe.\r\n\r\nWith her snake, of which they had immediately manifested a fear, she had\r\nfollowed where these monsters led, although unwillingly. They had given\r\nher food, but they had appeared to have no thought or consideration of\r\nher weakened condition, nor even of the fact that she was a woman and\r\ntherefore not as strong as themselves. In consequence of this, she had\r\nbeen obliged to march through the jungle till nearly ready to drop from\r\nsheer weariness of body. Her clothing had been torn to tatters on the\r\nbrush; her shoes had been all but ruined, and her flesh had been\r\nscratched and bruised.\r\n\r\n“That is all there is to tell,” she concluded. “It has been a horrid,\r\ndesperate existence ever since. The monsters have never been cruel, but\r\nI have been burned in the sun, and I have shivered in the rain and chill\r\nof night. I have been trembling at the thought of some terrible death,\r\nand then praying that I might really die and end all the wretched\r\nhorror. I couldn’t tell where I was,—you say you don’t even know\r\nyourself,—and day and night I have been in a condition of dread\r\nbordering on insanity. It has all been so terribly hopeless—so\r\nloathsome. Oh how I have suffered! And that horrible old woman has\r\nwatched me like a hawk, and I couldn’t have escaped if I had tried, and\r\nI didn’t know where to get a boat, and I couldn’t make anything—not even\r\nclothes,—and the horrid female creatures stole nearly all I had left,\r\nand I didn’t even have a needle, or a piece of soap, or a toothbrush!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I could make you a comb,” I suggested, to drive away her\r\ndreadful thoughts, if possible, but she appeared not to hear.\r\n\r\n“Poor Papa,” she resumed, “I don’t know what he ever thought, or where\r\nhe is, or anything about anything.”\r\n\r\n“Oh well,” said I, “we’ll soon be getting away from here now, and\r\nperhaps the trip will turn out pretty well after all. You’ll probably be\r\nat home in a month, forgetting all about this expedition to the land of\r\nMissing Links.”\r\n\r\nShe shook her head, the wild look in her eyes came back. “That is too\r\ngood a dream to come true,” she said. “It doesn’t seem as if we can ever\r\nget away,—but oh, Mr. Nevers—I do hope you will never let them get me\r\nback,—oh if only you will take me away—if only you will!” and again she\r\nbroke down and sobbed, as if it had been a thousand times too much to\r\nbear.\r\n\r\n“I’ll do it or bust!” I assured her with much enthusiasm. “I couldn’t\r\nsay more than that if I tried. We’ll come out all right, don’t you\r\nworry.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n                          A PROSPECT OF WEALTH\r\n\r\n\r\nNone of my Links fell dead at the sight of the goddess and myself, when\r\nat last we were “home,” but that was merely because they were too\r\nuncivilised to have any nerves. The poor creatures contracted headache\r\nover the wonder of it all, however, for it utterly surpassed their\r\npowers of speculation.\r\n\r\nI think they were much more frightened of the captive snake than they\r\nhad been at my explosions. For this I blamed them not at all, having\r\nbeen rendered somewhat creepy by the beastly reptile myself. It was much\r\ntoo weird a pet. I was not so indelicate as to mention my feelings on\r\nthe subject to the goddess, but I did hope the abominable thing would\r\ndie, or get away.\r\n\r\nPoor old Fatty was dizzy with concern. For two whole days he could not\r\nhave told whether he was afoot or horseback. He was even suspicious of\r\nmyself. All the child-like creatures seemed to regard me with added awe,\r\nas if it were hopeless to attempt to solve the problem of the magic by\r\nwhich I produced the snake-charming woman. They regarded the boat and\r\nthe lake with more suspicion than before. A strangeness grew upon them;\r\nthey stood away in groups, speaking a monosyllable now and again; they\r\nstirred uneasily about, whenever the girl appeared.\r\n\r\nYet remarkably soon the females of the tribe began to note, with\r\ncuriosity, the costume worn by this stranger. Madame Albino assumed\r\nsundry airs with small delay. She also attempted to clothe her precious\r\nself with various skins; she eyed the interloper with comical disdain;\r\nshe likewise looked at me with unmistakable reproach in those pink,\r\nnervous optics of hers, as if she meant to say that she might have\r\nforgiven me before, but after this—never!\r\n\r\nAs for the girl herself, she was not exactly the same, when seen in the\r\ndaylight. She still had glorious eyes and her soft chestnut hair would\r\nhave been lovely, had it been combed or stabbed full of hardware to\r\nbuild it up in a psyche knot, but her nose was somewhat freckled, she\r\nwas burned a lively red, as to face, neck, shoulders, arms and ankles,\r\nand her great anxiety had made her a trifle thin. Yet she was beautiful,\r\nI still maintain, for her features were fine, her poise splendid and her\r\nhands and feet exquisitely moulded. What was more, her countenance was\r\nlighted from within, by a charm as rare as it is divine; she was lovely\r\nin her nature; she was womanly—and women, true women, are beautiful\r\nforever! I nodded mentally and determined to continue to call her “the\r\ngoddess.”\r\n\r\nIt being essential that we take some needed rest, before embarking for\r\nworlds unknown, I made my shelter as comfortable as facilities would\r\npermit, and abdicated in favour of the snake and the girl. However, my\r\nsubjects dug me a new palace in short order. This I occupied in my\r\ncustomary regal state. I was obliged to construct a wicker bungalo for\r\nhis snakeship, for it seemed the goddess grew weary of holding the\r\nmonster at times, and yet wished to restrain him from his natural desire\r\nto mingle with the creepers. Also I furnished the beast with gastronomic\r\ndelicacies of the season. He had a preference for squirrels, not even\r\nthe skins of which were left for me.\r\n\r\nI made some quiet preparations for the reception of our friends the\r\nBlacks, should they come in search of their former captive, but these\r\nconsisted only of restringing the bows and furbishing up the feathers on\r\nour arrows. I knew the fighting force of the feudal foe to be reduced\r\nand in no wise able to cope with ours, wherefore I deemed extraordinary\r\nmeasures unnecessary. As a matter of fact, no Blacks appeared, which led\r\nme to doubt if they even guessed that the goddess could be harboured in\r\nour village.\r\n\r\nHaving recovered all my energies shortly, I thought the girl would be\r\nready and anxious to leave without further delay. In consequence I began\r\nto lay in a stock of sun-dried meat, weapons and other things needful\r\nfor the cruise to the ocean. It soon became evident, however, that the\r\npoor young woman had suffered so severe a depression of vital forces, in\r\nthe long-continued strain of worry and physical anguish, that immediate\r\ndeparture was quite out of the question.\r\n\r\nWe had long, hopeful talks together, while I manufactured small trifles\r\nfor her greater comfort, or brought her foods to cook at a small\r\nstone-and-clay stove which I managed to construct; and she often related\r\nthe history of her days of trouble. She had been too deeply alarmed all\r\nthe time to give much attention to studying her captors; however, she\r\nthought from what I told her that they must have a similar language to\r\nthat employed by the Reds, and many similar habits. Their attitude\r\ntoward herself had led her to believe that they actually had a great\r\nreverence for human beings.\r\n\r\nOf the man who had evidently once been among them she knew but little.\r\nShe had seen the skeleton, but had only been able to make the merest\r\nguesses as to how it came to be in such a place and in such a remarkable\r\ncondition. She had also seen a linen collar, preserved by having fallen\r\ninto a chink which kept it protected from the elements, and this\r\nindicated, she thought, that the man had been a clergyman. That he had\r\nproduced certain effects upon the creatures, the results of which would\r\nendure, she had no doubt. Though they had no other weapons than their\r\nclubs, they appeared to be more fearless than my fellows. Any fishing\r\noperations which they might once have conducted, guided by the man, were\r\nnow discontinued, she was sure, for she had never seen a fish in the\r\ncamp. The dug-outs were in ruins, as I had thought, though some of the\r\ncreatures employed them still for sleeping purposes. She did not believe\r\nthey utilised any caves. Without telling her of my own theories of the\r\ngold cauldron, I questioned her sufficiently to convince myself that she\r\nknew nothing of its existence in the place.\r\n\r\nAbout the fights and hunting expeditions of the tribe, she possessed\r\nonly the most general information. She had not been able to ascertain\r\nwhat manner of enemies they encountered, but once had seen a wounded\r\nfellow striving to pull out of his leg a piece of wood which she now\r\nknew must have been an arrow. Also she had been aware that some\r\ntremendous calamity had befallen the fighters on their last crusade, for\r\nbarely half the force had returned to camp, and of these many were\r\nshockingly wounded. Fully twenty, she said, had died and been buried\r\nsince the day of the trouble. Beyond these few facts, the goddess told\r\nme very little which differed from the tale of the daily routine of my\r\nown loyal subjects.\r\n\r\nIn the boat, my bear-skin was concealed by a cover of leaves as before.\r\nI was thinking, one morning, of the various things I should take, when\r\nthe moment for leaving should finally arrive, when the two great\r\nclubs—mine by right of conquest—thrust themselves upon my notice. The\r\none which was made of the nugget appealed to my human spirit of\r\nacquisitiveness with great potency. Indeed the thing awakened a train of\r\nthought which bordered somewhat on the wild and not-too-wholesome. I\r\nfound myself coveting my neighbour’s cauldron of gold.\r\n\r\nHeretofore I had given the geyser cavern, where the precious metal was\r\nbeing deposited, not the slightest consideration. I had known of only\r\none way to approach the place, namely, by the long passage, the end of\r\nwhich I might not be able to find, and which at best could only lead me\r\nto a point high above the place of treasure. I knew, also, that snakes\r\nabided in the passage and that getting gold up to the point where Fatty\r\nand I had been that day and then out through the tortuous tunnel was\r\nsimply impossible, as a task. Even the nugget on the club—after the\r\nfirst inevitable thrill which I could not help feeling, to see it and\r\nknow its worth,—had been no more to me than any rock, for what could it\r\npurchase in such a land as this?\r\n\r\nBut now—how things had altered! Not only did I feel the greatest\r\nconfidence in my ability to pilot my boat away from that open prison, to\r\na land where gold would be the “open sesame” to the whole world, but I\r\nknew of an opening—or thought I did—to the cave where the precious metal\r\nwas lying ready to be had for the taking. It was a magic thought—an\r\nintoxicating dream. The precious deposit belonged to no one, for who\r\nwere the Missing Links? I should do no injury to anyone by taking all I\r\nneeded. And why should I not have some remuneration for all this exile,\r\nlabour and suffering?\r\n\r\n“Why,” said I, and half seriously at that, “a king simply has to be\r\nrich!”\r\n\r\nThe task seemed easy, as I dreamed of proceeding to the spot, taking\r\nwhat I wanted and then escaping with it as I had with the goddess. The\r\nidea expanded rapidly; it began to make me feverish. As usual, when I\r\ngave myself over to anything new, I forgot everything else about me.\r\nEven the goddess and her snake became of secondary importance; escape\r\nitself was indefinitely postponed. The premier question was, “When shall\r\nI do it?” I answered aloud:\r\n\r\n“Why—to-day—to-night! What’s the use of waiting?”\r\n\r\nThen it became imperative that I should formulate a plan. The bear-skin\r\nwas the fundamental basis which gave me the courage to think of\r\nattempting the task. I knew how to manage in regard to that, as well as\r\nI knew how nicely it would work, if only the light were not too\r\nsearching. What more might the work require? Obviously I should need a\r\nsack, in which to carry off the plunder; and I ought to have a pick or a\r\nsledge-hammer, or something in the way of a tool with which to detach\r\nthe solid chunks of metal. For the sack, I decided to sew together some\r\nof the skins which were lying on the floor of my shelter. For tools I\r\nwould carry a couple of the stoutest clubs to be had in the camp. In\r\naddition to these requisites, I could think of nothing I should need,\r\nexcept my weapons.\r\n\r\nI lost no time in setting about the preparations for this financial\r\nventure. It seemed a pity to rob the goddess and her snake of the rugs\r\non which they reclined at various times, in my dug-out, but there was\r\nnothing else to do. All the tribe-fellows’ clubs having proved\r\nthemselves to be serviceable, I had no difficulty in selecting two which\r\nI deemed worthy of the great occasion.\r\n\r\nOld Fatty had resumed his faithful attendance on my every movement and\r\ntherefore he followed me down to the boat, carrying both of the clubs\r\nand the skins. He stood on the bank and watched me embark, more crazy\r\nthan ever to go along, but still too frightened to trust himself afloat\r\non the lake. I had no wish to have company. Bidding him “be good,” I\r\npushed away and started on the expedition.\r\n\r\nBy the time I had finished the work of fastening the skins together, the\r\nafternoon was half gone. There was nothing to do, in the way of work\r\nwhich would occupy my time, and I felt no desire to get into the\r\nbear-skin prematurely, as I had done before, so that I was finally\r\nobliged to pull in my oars and drift idly on the water. This was a\r\nsleepy occupation. I nodded drowsily for half an hour, at the end of\r\nwhich time I fell fast asleep.\r\n\r\nThe sun was just disappearing when at last I awoke. Disgusted with\r\nmyself, for having thus overdone the time-wasting business, I rowed\r\nrapidly for Outlet river, to which I came duly. Standing up in the boat\r\nI arrayed myself in my costume; then I worked slowly down the river, as\r\nbefore, and beached the boat in the spot where I had landed on the last\r\nsuccessful venture.\r\n\r\nAlready the dusk made the forest gloomy, but as this was precisely what\r\nI wanted, I struck off without delay, picking a path cautiously through\r\nthe growth. The neighbourhood seemed remarkably still, but finally the\r\nrumble from the cauldron disturbed the quiet and gave me a guide by\r\nwhich I corrected my course.\r\n\r\nLaden as I was, with the necessary things for the labour, I should have\r\npresented a most amazing aspect, had any of the Blacks discovered my\r\npresence. I thought of that, and knew that even if I got down in the\r\nnormal position of a bear, the juxtaposition of my bag and the clubs\r\nmight easily arouse the most dangerous suspicions in the brain of any\r\nLink beholding them and me. However, nothing happened.\r\n\r\n“Why this is going to be a pic-nic,” I muttered. “I couldn’t ask for\r\nanything nicer.”\r\n\r\nIndeed fortune seemed to be smiling upon me, for I came immediately upon\r\na continuation of the cliff of rock, which backed the camp of the\r\nBlacks, and was soon confronted by a jagged heap of stone and quartz, at\r\nthe top of which appeared a dark, irregular cave. Before I could clamber\r\nup the pile to this opening, the mighty roar came belching forth. I knew\r\nI stood on the threshold of the cavern of wealth and wonder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIX\r\n                       STEALING THE ENEMY’S FIRE\r\n\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the demonstration ceased than I hastened up the rock-heap\r\nto the cave. I found the mouth of the place somewhat choked and hard to\r\nenter, but I forced my way over massed-in boulders to a vestibule of the\r\ngreat treasure-house itself. Then suddenly my hopes were blighted and\r\nfailure loomed before me. It was as dark as tar and I had clean\r\nforgotten to fetch a torch!\r\n\r\n“But how could I have fetched a torch?” my brain demanded. I had no\r\ncivilised matches; I could not have carried a brand all day, for the\r\nsake of having it now, and if I had, the smoke might have attracted the\r\nattention of the Blacks. Had they caught a bear with a torch in his hand\r\nthey would unquestionably have desired an explanation. I thought of my\r\nknife, which was steel, and the flints on my arrows. Could I not produce\r\na spark, ignite some tinder and then make some faggots take fire? Yes, I\r\ncould, but the arrows were all in the boat and I had about as much\r\ntinder handy as a fellow could carry in his eye.\r\n\r\nIn desperation I groped ahead for a rod and nearly broke my neck, by\r\njolting down an unseen step in the floor. It was useless to tackle the\r\ncavern in this inky blackness; I might easily get boiled to death by the\r\nfountain of scalding water. In bitter regret, I reproached myself for\r\nhaving come away from camp without consulting the goddess and without\r\nmaturing my plans. But any ass should have known the place would be\r\ndark! I acknowledged that I was a fool, and that after all this bother I\r\nshould have to give it up. Even if I did come again next day, it would\r\nbe no easy matter to fetch a torch, and I might try a hundred times and\r\nnot have the luck I had this evening in avoiding those villains, the\r\nBlacks.\r\n\r\nMore than ready to swear at my folly, mad as a hornet to think of\r\nabandoning all the gold, which was right there, almost within reach of\r\nmy hands, I pinched myself viciously and groped my way out to the heap\r\nof rocks at the entrance.\r\n\r\nAlready a star was shining in the heavens. What good were stars, I would\r\nhave liked to know. It was fire I wanted—fire at the end of a stick. A\r\ncrazy idea of hunting for something highly inflammable, on which to try\r\nmy flint and steel, tried to get started in my brain. I rejected the\r\nnotion with scorn. I might as well begin a search for glow-worms or\r\nincandescent electric globes.\r\n\r\n“Those fools of Links have got plenty of fire,” I grumbled, spitefully.\r\n“For about two cents I’d kick them all out of their camp and take all\r\nthe torches I could carry.”\r\n\r\nThis bit of pleasantry somewhat restored my humour. I started up from\r\nwhere I was sitting on the rocks, abruptly, possessed of a great idea.\r\nWhy not make the trick worth the winning; why not steal their fire to\r\nlight myself in robbing their cave?\r\n\r\nIn my haste to clamber down from the pile, I fell forward and struck my\r\nhand smartly on something which felt like a collected lot of wood. I was\r\nready to kick this thing, for bruising my fingers, when I comprehended\r\nthat wood was exactly what I required. Grasping one of the branches I\r\nlifted a whole bundle of sticks, all dry, cut neatly of an equal length,\r\nand tied about with some sort of cord. Instantly I thought of the gilded\r\nskeleton—the man who had lived in this place. I believed he had come to\r\nthe cavern often, and that doubtless these faggots had been gathered by\r\nhimself for torches.\r\n\r\nThis discovery gave me new enthusiasm. I was calmer, also, and I\r\ntherefore resolved to proceed carefully, do nothing rash, and to wait\r\nuntil the time was propitious before attempting to steal my fire.\r\nNevertheless I was determined not to give up the game until flatly\r\nbeaten. Much luck in the past had made me bolder than I was when I\r\narrived in the country.\r\n\r\nDuring the half hour following, I crept through the woods, toward the\r\nspot where I had waited for the goddess. I thought it would bring me bad\r\nluck to try any other location. My clubs and the sack, I had left at the\r\ncauldron, along with my bundle of wood. Thus I had nothing to impede my\r\nprogress; but the skin in which I was clothed hampered every motion.\r\n\r\nThroughout the jungle, various sounds had commenced, for the darkness\r\nwas rapidly becoming that of full-fledged night. Through the trees, when\r\nI approached their clearing, I caught the gleam of the fires about which\r\nthe Links were cooking their dinner.\r\n\r\nKnife in hand, I edged and pushed through the creepers and vines until I\r\ndared go no further. From where I was, I could see very much the same\r\nsort of groups about the fires which had made the picture weird on the\r\nformer occasion. But I was actually more excited and eager over the\r\npresent enterprise than I had been before, when a fellow-being was in\r\nthe game. Doubtless this arose from the greater risk I expected to take.\r\n\r\nImpatient as I was, the Links seemed to require an interminable time to\r\nget ready for bed. I selected one and then another of the fires as the\r\none from which I would filch a brand, but was finally obliged to wait\r\nand see which would be the most favourable to my task. I desired to\r\nselect the one furthest from the sleeping places, and yet not too far\r\nfrom my cover. The one first abandoned by the Links would have answered\r\nwell. I watched it narrowly and kept an eye on the Blacks, who were\r\nstill lingering about. Long before the fellows had all retired, the fire\r\nbecame hopeless, so few were the embers left aglow. I was obliged to fix\r\nupon another.\r\n\r\nI waited all of two hours, by the end of which time the Links were all\r\nsafely asleep, save that watchful old fiend whose acquaintance I had\r\nmade on my former visit. When at length he laid himself down for the\r\nnight, his position was such that my intended deed had been rendered far\r\nmore difficult than I had expected. It became necessary for me to make a\r\nlong detour, for I deemed it wise that I should be able to make a\r\nbee-line for cover the second I procured my bit of fire.\r\n\r\nIn crawling and walking carefully about the tangle, I consumed a lot of\r\ntime. My position then was such that by creeping bear-like from the\r\nvines and going straight for my original hiding place, I would pass the\r\nremains of a fire, in which only one or two blazing pieces of wood\r\nremained. Again I drew my knife. With a thumping heart, high up in my\r\nneck, I began this desperate experiment.\r\n\r\nA night-bird hooted before I had gone three paces. That alert old\r\nwretch, the sentinel Black, stirred about and turned sleepily over. For\r\nseveral minutes I remained motionless; then again I moved cautiously\r\nforward. Although I expected the worst possible calamities to happen\r\nevery moment, and thought my own breathing would betray my presence, I\r\nneared the fire without arousing the lightest sleeper. Approaching the\r\nburned-out heap, I selected the brand I would take, before I was there.\r\nIn consequence of this, I lost no time, but passed silently on, when I\r\nhad the precious ember in my possession. Transferring it quickly to my\r\nleft hand, in order to conceal its glowing end from any eyes which might\r\nby chance be open, I dragged it on the ground beside me, and headed for\r\nthe shelter, which to reach would mean success.\r\n\r\nA half chuckle escaped me, at the thought of the Links’ stupidity and my\r\nown adroitness, for the vines were now but a dozen feet away. Yet I was\r\nhorribly nervous, not daring to look behind me and fearing that anything\r\nmight be happening, now that my back was turned upon the sleeping foe. I\r\nreached the cover in triumph, however, and even crawled to a small open\r\nspot, when suddenly something gave me a vigorous push with its foot.\r\n\r\nInstantly then that monstrous old watch Link, recognised me, raised his\r\nclub and poised to fetch it down with a blow that should scatter my\r\nbrains. I saw him, knew he had caught me, realised that more silently\r\nthan I he had followed the singular bear that would steal a brand of\r\nfire, and quick as a gun-spring I shot up against him, butted him hard\r\nin the ribs and we closed, in a duel to the death.\r\n\r\nMy only thought was—“Choke him off!” I knew that a single yell would\r\nbring an army of foes upon me; I knew he had made no sound before\r\nbecause of his commendable desire to determine my nature while I was\r\nstill unaware of his presence. Now I swiftly determined that not a sound\r\nshould he make, unless he did it over my dead body. I was thrice as\r\nvicious as he, I verily believe, as I threw myself in against his body\r\nand fastened my clutch on his throat. I was fierce as only a frightened\r\nand desperate man can be; I was strong as three of my kind, in that\r\nmoment of terrible need.\r\n\r\nHis arms had been raised with the club; the weapon had even been\r\ndescending as I thumped him violently backward. Down came the great\r\nrock, but the force of the blow was gone, and the aim was so ruined that\r\nhe struck us both on the leg. He dropped the thing as useless, for he\r\ncould not have raised it again had he tried. But with his long,\r\niron-like arms he fought like a fiend, to shove me off, to gouge out my\r\nribs and to grip my throat as I was gripping his, with all but two of my\r\nfingers. The two fingers gripped the handle of my knife.\r\n\r\nThe length of his arms was for once against him. I was as close up as\r\nflesh can freeze to flesh. His head was thrust far back; already his\r\nbreathing muscles were swelling and labouring beneath my thumbs. We\r\nstruggled about in the darkness hither and thither, wrestling, flinging,\r\ntreading on roots and branches and exerting the utmost of our strength\r\nto win the battle.\r\n\r\nThe monster’s muscles were something prodigious; his activity was simply\r\nincredible. I have choked a man to submission in thirty seconds, but it\r\nseemed as if I could never weaken this brute nor reduce him to a state\r\nwherein I could use my knife. He fought me with his feet, scratched me\r\nand kicked my shins. He got his bone-and-wire arms against my stomach at\r\nlast and clutched me and pushed me till I thought I should shriek with\r\npain. Had I not been protected by the bear-skin, I think he would have\r\nkilled me, in spite of the tremendous advantage I had gained at the\r\noutset. All this time the only sound was what I made in breathing and\r\nwhat we made with our scuffling about. It was an ominously silent duel.\r\n\r\nOver we toppled, tripped by a creeper, and rolled on the ground among\r\nthe vines. He had me under, like a cat with a squirrel, but I felt him\r\nbeginning to quiver all over. My grip had not been broken for a moment,\r\nbut now it nearly gave way; a weakness was stealing over me, for he was\r\ncrushing my ribs where I had received the blow with the nugget club.\r\nThis was the particular time when the bear-skin helped me out.\r\n\r\nSomething smarted my leg then—the brand of fire. I had struck against\r\nit. This made me furious. A gush of hot, new strength welled up in my\r\nveins and along all my sinews. My finger-ends dug in about his wind-pipe\r\ndeeper and deeper. I heaved him over; his arms were becoming like lead;\r\nhis motions were powerless; all the force seemed slipping from his body.\r\nKnowing my time had come, I gave the knife in my hand a sudden turn and\r\npush against the jugular vein, swelling beneath my pressure, and felt\r\nhim shudder in death in a moment.\r\n\r\nUntil I was sure he would move no more, nor raise a sound, I remained\r\nastride his chest. The stillness then was awful. Not a sound could I\r\nhear but that of my own laboured breathing and the trickle and drip of\r\nthis creature’s blood. I admit the dread of it all made me tremble. It\r\nseemed such a ghastly end to my innocent escapade.\r\n\r\nBut having plunged so deeply into the business, for the sake of a bit of\r\nfire, I did not intend to leave the work unfinished because of this\r\nunavoidable incident. Therefore I caught up the glowing branch, which\r\nhad nearly been smothered out as we rolled it in the grass, and blowing\r\nupon it to liven it up, I stole away from that gory arena.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XL\r\n                              COVETED GOLD\r\n\r\n\r\nStill breathing hard, from the effects of the duel, I reached the heap\r\nof stone, outside the cavern and hunted up my bundle of wood. I sat down\r\non a rock to get my torches lighted. This was not an easy matter, for\r\nalthough my brand was a species of wood which retained fire remarkably\r\nlong, I was obliged to gather many small dry twigs and bits of dead\r\ncreeper, to which I added hair from the skins, before I could make a\r\nblaze. Once having accomplished this feat, however, I found that the\r\ntorch-faggots burned with all the fierceness of pitch.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging that the skeleton-man had succeeded in finding a wood\r\nwhich surpassed for torches anything that I had yet discovered, I threw\r\nmy bag and clubs inside the cave and climbed in after, with all the\r\nlight I needed.\r\n\r\nSo far, the getting of treasure had not proved to be the “pic-nic” I had\r\npreviously been led to suppose was about to be enjoyed. Holding my torch\r\nabove my head and carrying both the clubs beneath my other arm, I now\r\nwent along in this wonder-house, waxing momentarily more and more\r\nexcited by the prospect of seeing what was there.\r\n\r\nThe passage was narrow and low, it was likewise crooked, and the floor\r\nwas rough and uneven. On the walls there was not the slightest\r\nindication of anything precious. I have never seen stone more dull. This\r\nmade me doubt if I had come to the cauldron of gold, after all. The\r\ntrend of the tunnel was downward. Presently I came to a “jump off” four\r\nfeet high. The bottom of this secondary gallery sloped rapidly downward.\r\nThen I emerged from the tunnel-like hall, into a larger chamber. The\r\nfirst thing I saw was water, in a crevice. I jumped then like a scared\r\ncat, for a drop of the liquid fell plump on my nose from the ceiling,\r\nwhere steam had condensed.\r\n\r\nA second after this I got a brilliant gleam of reflected light, from an\r\nobject on the floor, a rod away. It was gold. To right and left flashed\r\nsimilar reflections. I hastened onward, and then halted, dizzy with\r\namazement, for below me, in a great basin was ebon water that moved, and\r\nabout it were nodules and drippings of gold, and stuffed into crevices\r\nwas gold on gold. I leaped a ditch, above which the mist was rising, hot\r\nand damp. Beyond this, down in the very cauldron itself, which was\r\ninaccessible and awe-inspiring, I beheld those stalagmites of solid\r\nmetal, those building nuggets and the seething abyss of water and\r\nnatural acid which before I had seen from above.\r\n\r\nThe ascending steam curtained off the mouth of the cave above which I\r\nknew to be over this eerie place, but I was far too eager for what was\r\nabout me, to spend my time in looking upward. It was not a place of\r\ndazzling beauty; on the contrary it was dull, dripping and misty, but\r\nhere, there, in unexpected places I caught that inimitable glitter.\r\nHaving seen one piece of the forming gold-hunks, it seemed as if I were\r\nqualified to see a score. The heat of the place was tremendous, the air\r\nhumid and hard to breathe.\r\n\r\nSo deep was the boiling water that I could see nothing of what was\r\nbelow, yet I knew from seeing the shallows, golden on the bottom, that\r\nthe basin was doubtless plated throughout with the beautiful metal. I\r\nwas wild with enthusiasm; I wanted to knock off tons of nuggets; I began\r\nto wonder if I could take it all. Quickly clambering over jagged piles,\r\nI stepped on a boulder that stood above an apron of rock all seamed with\r\ncracks in which the gold had been stuffed till the places were full.\r\n\r\nWhile I was standing there, the rumble of the mighty giant commenced to\r\nresound in the cavern. Alarmed at the thought that the water might surge\r\nup and engulf me where I stood, I started to flee to a safer retreat. My\r\nheel got caught in a crevice. The harder I tugged, the tighter it became\r\nwedged. Stooping I got my fingers in behind it and slid it forward and\r\nout. The second it cleared, my thumb struck an object full of something\r\nthat felt like nails. Glancing once at the place, I was astonished to\r\nsee the heel of a boot, not unlike my own.\r\n\r\nI leaped away to safety and the marvellous geyser burst upward. The\r\nroaring noises thundered upon the air of the place with deafening\r\nreverberations; the steam rolled away in tremendous volumes. Spray and\r\ndrops of the boiling liquid that splashed, fell all about, some on my\r\nhand, burning me badly. The basin was all a-surge with its seething\r\nbrew; the waters gushed hungrily up, swirling about, filling the cracks\r\nand tossing in extreme agitation.\r\n\r\nDown came the massive column of the fountain, as if the source had been\r\ncut off in an instant. A tidal wave of the boiling stuff swelled up to\r\nthe brink of the cauldron, inundating the golden nodules, stalagmites\r\nand the radiating fissures.\r\n\r\nI knew, then, as much as a man could ever know, who had not been\r\npresent, how that other man had lost his life, and how it came that his\r\nskeleton was gilded. That heel told the story. He had probably caught\r\nhis foot just as I had done, but he had not been able to get away. He\r\nhad doubtless fallen headlong into the basin of boiling liquid, where\r\nhis life must have been forfeited instantly. Then time after time the\r\nwater had risen about him, until all the flesh had been boiled away from\r\nthe bones, and then the process of plating with gold had commenced on\r\nthe skeleton. Poor wretch. It had then been left, I thought, for one of\r\nthe braver spirits among the Links to rescue all that remained and carry\r\nit forth from the dread cavern. I felt somewhat chilly to think how near\r\nI had been to the same dreadful fate.\r\n\r\nThe demonstration having ceased, the water subsided, the rocks and\r\nnuggets dripped, and the steam arose, hotter than before. My zeal for\r\nexploring the place had oozed away. It seemed to me that discretion\r\ncounselled me to complete my work and depart.\r\n\r\n“I’ll only stop for a few hundred pounds,” I told myself with a feeling\r\nof virtuous moderation. “A man should never be a pig.”\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do was to strip off my bear-skin, in which I was now\r\nperspiring like a porpoise. Then I selected a fine, large nodule of\r\ngold, from the vicinity of which I could easily escape when the geyser\r\nbegan to spout, and this I began to batter with one of the clubs. I had\r\nconceived an idea that I would bend these formations over and break them\r\noff with comparative ease. I was in for a large disappointment.\r\n\r\nNot only were the gold masses bended over at the expense of great energy\r\nand perseverance, but they refused to break after quite a number of such\r\nbendings. That first one having been once so bent, refused to be knocked\r\nback in the opposite direction. Also the geyser took its turn very soon\r\nand in the end I humbly abandoned nodule number one and tackled one\r\nwhich was smaller.\r\n\r\nIt was at least an hour before my labours were awarded with any real\r\nsuccess whatsoever. But at last I had a chunk of metal of something like\r\nfive pounds weight. Mopping my head, puffing and losing my temper, I\r\n“picked on” the smaller pieces now with great sagacity. I pounded and\r\npried, grunted and wrenched, waited for the geyser to have its say and\r\nthen went at it again, till I lost all reckoning of time. After several\r\nfailures, however, I got the knack of this mining business better, and\r\nwhat with smashing rocks away to facilitate the work and contenting\r\nmyself with modest chunks, I got loose and heaped up something over a\r\nhundred weight of treasure, according to my estimate by guessing.\r\n\r\n“That’s enough for any man of sense,” I finally assured myself. “I’d be\r\nashamed to take any more.”\r\n\r\nLighting a new torch, from the one I had planted in a chink, I went out\r\ntoward the entrance and secured my bag. To my amazement I discovered\r\nthat the day had broken. I had worked for hours that sped like minutes.\r\nSomewhat concerned about any Links, who might be stirring, I hastened\r\nback, threw my hoard into the skin pouch and staggered with it to the\r\njump-off, where I boosted it up hurriedly. On emerging from the mouth of\r\nthe cave, I was obliged to rest, so weary had I become from my\r\nlong-sustained labours. However, I dared not pause, at so late an hour,\r\nand therefore I shouldered my load again and started away, leaving\r\nbear-skin, torches and clubs behind. My only idea now was to reach the\r\nboat in haste.\r\n\r\nIn spite of my stubbornness, I could walk not more than fifty yards at a\r\ntime with my burden, before putting it down to give myself “a blow.” It\r\nwas such a dead weight, and I had used up my whole reserve of force.\r\nBreathing my great relief, to find myself out at last, within one more\r\ncarry of the boat, I set the sack down in a thicket and leaned against a\r\ntree to rest my muscles. As I turned about to resume the load, a\r\nstartling yell suddenly penetrated the forest.\r\n\r\nJump about as quickly as I could, I was not in time to avoid a furious\r\nonslaught. A hideous female Link, as black as rubber and apparently as\r\nold as the jungle, launched herself upon me and bit me on the shoulder\r\nso severely that I cried out in pain and struck her with my knife before\r\nI could stop to remember that a male should spare a female creature. The\r\nsteel went deep in her side. She wrenched with her jaws where she was\r\nbiting as she fell away, and injured a cord in my neck, which made me\r\nall but collapse with sudden nausea and weakness.\r\n\r\nBefore I could shake her off, after pulling out the knife, the forest\r\nechoed with the yells of countless demons rushing toward me from the\r\ndirection of the cave. Undone, incapable of showing fight with my\r\ndagger, against so large and fierce a mob, I tore myself free from the\r\nclutch of the female and ran as hard as possible toward the river.\r\n\r\nThat terrible female, stabbed only through the fleshy muscles under her\r\narm, made a dive for my feet and hauled me down. I slashed off two of\r\nher fingers with a vicious lunge, and darted away again at the top of my\r\nspeed.\r\n\r\nBy this time many of the demons were hot on my trail, crying out in\r\nfearful monosyllables, tearing through the brush, and attempting to head\r\nme off. The foremost fellow threw his club and the handle of it struck\r\nme on the leg. I snatched it up, well knowing the creature would catch\r\nme before I could go another twenty strides, and leaping behind a tree I\r\nwaited half a moment. He rushed to the spot, headlong and reckless. Down\r\ncame his own weapon, and he fell like a dead bull. But the motion of\r\nstriking nearly killed me, so fearful was the wrench where the female\r\nhad bitten the sinew.\r\n\r\nOnce more I ran dizzily away, at the head of that screaming horde of\r\nLinks. Club after club was hurled to fetch me down, but all went wide. I\r\nwas beating them all—I knew it—I should reach the boat, for none were\r\naware of its presence. It was hardly more than a rod away.\r\n\r\nStumbling and pitching, ready to fall down in my agony, I dived through\r\na hedge of vines and was thrown headlong within reach of the prow I knew\r\nso well. Up and shoving at the boat in a twinkling, I heard the vines\r\nbeing ripped apart behind me. Having held on to the club till I fell\r\nhere, I turned and pounced upon it and swung it back in time to crash it\r\nfairly in the pit of the black devil’s stomach, as he hurtled upon me.\r\n\r\nDropping it instantly, I shoved off the boat with all the strength I\r\nhad, and leaped in, as three or four more of the fiends came dashing\r\nmadly down to the river’s edge. This time when they threw their clubs I\r\nwas struck fairly on the fleshy portion of the back and knocked on my\r\nface across the seat. Hurt by the blow, but strong in my instinct for\r\nself-preservation, I got out the oars in jig-time and drove the good old\r\ncraft up the stream and away from the murderous brutes on the bank, like\r\na madman. Rowing almost straight for the further side, I distanced all\r\nthe clubs speedily. When they realised the utter futility of pursuit,\r\nthe enraged creatures merely yelled their maledictions as I went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLI\r\n                          FAREWELL TO THE CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strength which had risen in my desperation, even against the shock\r\nto my system which had been given by the bite of the female monster,\r\ndeparted before I was out of the river. I trembled from head to foot; I\r\nwas ill all over and nearly as limp as a string.\r\n\r\nHow serious the bite might be I had no means of ascertaining. To my\r\nhand, when I felt of the place, there seemed to be only a raw, smarting\r\nwound, on the top of a great hot swelling. I felt sure that no thews had\r\nbeen actually severed by the terrible teeth, for had any been, I should\r\nnot have been able to row the boat nor to use my arm in any manner\r\nwhatsoever. Nevertheless I knew I was wounded badly, and I all but cried\r\nwith the pain it cost me to move the craft.\r\n\r\nUntil I had reached the lake, the fear of the Blacks made me work,\r\ndespite my physical anguish. When I knew I was comparatively safe, I\r\nsank forward and, I confess, fainted like a girl.\r\n\r\nIt was probably as much as an hour before I recovered my senses fully.\r\nFor the last fifteen minutes or so of this time I was semi-conscious,\r\nbut incapable of motion, while my brain merely whirled in a vortex with\r\nthat female Link, the boat and the nuggets of gold. When at last I again\r\nacquired the power of moving, I filled my hand with water from the lake\r\nrepeatedly and dashed it on my face and on my bitten shoulder. But I\r\ncould not row; I needed further rest.\r\n\r\nMy head was beginning to ache. My brain insisted on revolving the story\r\nof my greed for gold. Again I fought the battle of silence with the\r\nwatch-dog of the tribe; again I worked like a gnome in that steaming,\r\nhot cauldron; again I staggered away with my plunder. Then I saw that\r\nfemale Link, who, searching in the thicket, must have found the body of\r\nthe watch-dog, lying in his gore. He might have been her mate. Crazed,\r\nshe followed on the trail that led from the spot, with the tribe at her\r\nheels. She reached the cauldron and then got again on the tracks I was\r\nmaking to the river. At that I screamed and thought I was crazy myself.\r\n\r\nAroused by this repeated nightmare, I struggled with the oars again. It\r\nseemed as if I could not budge the boat; this made me work like a fury.\r\nThe heat of the sun grew intolerable; I could feel it baking the blood\r\nin my head; it was all on the side of the Blacks. The lake was a sheen\r\nof blinding light and heat; it mocked me and held me back. Again and\r\nagain came the lurid panorama of events. I could see through everything,\r\njungle, thicket and bag made of skin—see those pieces of gold—mine!\r\nmine!—shining like the blazing sun, hot and baking. All that gold on the\r\nground was mine, but it mocked me and cooked my brain with its heat and\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\nI lost all reckoning; I rowed to escape the nightmare and the lake that\r\nheld me back. The sun got up in mid-heaven, and still I was on that\r\nshimmering water. I knew nothing, absolutely, of what I did, except that\r\nI rowed to get away from that female Link, who seemed to bite me times\r\nwithout number, and always in that same burning spot. I must have\r\nfainted half a dozen times; I rowed toward home between these spells by\r\ninstinct only. The distance which I could ordinarily compass in a little\r\nmore than an hour, required no less than seven hours, this fateful day.\r\nWhen I think of the heat, the weight of the boat and my physical\r\ncondition, I wonder I did not die, and drift to the shore.\r\n\r\nAs it was, I have not the slightest recollection of having reached the\r\nbank. I thought that for years and years I strove to get away from that\r\nlast terrible encounter. When at length my brain was clear and I opened\r\nmy eyes, in the slow, weak manner of one who has all but passed to the\r\nfurther side of the dark river, I saw a beautiful, worried face above my\r\nown—the face of the goddess.\r\n\r\n“Thank God!” she whispered fervently, when she saw that I was mad no\r\nlonger, and the poor girl cried as she bathed my head and bade me go to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nI had nearly pegged out, and that is the truth. When I was strong enough\r\nto hear my own story, I learned of things which will never cease to fill\r\nme with wonder, and with many emotions too soft to parade. It was good\r\nold Fatty who had seen me coming; and he it was that finally carried me\r\nbodily up the hill. Then for a nurse I had never lacked for a moment.\r\nThe goddess and Fatty, he her slave, she my guardian angel, had done the\r\nall that could be done, with the poor facilities at hand, for a man in\r\nsuch desperate straits that he raves night and day for a week. But the\r\ngoddess really saved me, when all is said, for she knew the properties\r\nof certain tropical plants and with the crushed leaves of one she drew\r\nthe poison from the bite, reduced the swelling and made it possible for\r\nproper healing to commence. I had done the worst possible thing, in\r\nrowing home through the heat and with such a wound, but if I had not\r\ndone exactly what I did, and when I did, my doctor and nurse would never\r\nhave had the opportunity of proving their skill.\r\n\r\nThey were strange days that followed—strange for me, who had never been\r\ndown on my back with illness before since childhood, for the fever left\r\nme thin, weak, and feeling so helpless that I had no desire to move as\r\nmuch as one of my feet. My first poignant thought was about the Blacks,\r\nand the danger of their swooping down upon us again. When I knew that\r\nfor a week there had been no sign of any foe, I thought they had\r\nprobably undergone too great a fright on the last occasion to require\r\nany more for some considerable time.\r\n\r\nFor another week I lay like a baby, in the shelter, eating fruits and\r\nbits of meat which the goddess prepared as best she could. How I yearned\r\nto see her face, whenever she left me for a moment! Then came the time\r\nwhen I began to mend, and desired to have back my strength and my title\r\nof king.\r\n\r\nWhen I stood up and wobbled about on my pins one day, I made a discovery\r\nwhich did much to hasten a return to my old condition. The crystal club,\r\npresented to me by the ex-chief, in token of my exalted station and\r\nregal attainments, had been stolen. I learned that the ex-chief had\r\ndared to carry this sceptre of power into the jungle; I learned from\r\nFatty that the jealous Madame Albino had been the one to rob me of my\r\ntrophy. She feared the goddess—who in truth was more of a queen of the\r\ntribe than I had even been a king,—but the creature had not feared a man\r\nwho was crazy and likely to die.\r\n\r\nSo wroth did I wax over this outrage to my dignity that I became\r\nunmanageable at once. Thin as a rail, but able to stagger about, next\r\nday, I dug up one of my lesser bombs from the magazine, and waving it\r\nwildly above my head, marched up to the guilty ex-chief, while he had\r\nthe club underneath him, as he sat on the ground, and scared him half to\r\ndeath. He knew the bomb,—no trouble about that. I therefore took the\r\ncrystal club away from him, rudely, and slapped his face. He fell down\r\ninstantly and began to adore my tracks in the proper spirit of\r\nhumiliation, followed without delay by all the tribe. Madame Albino fled\r\nto the woods, though what manner of personal violence the lady expected\r\nI have never been able to guess. This fine, large bluff, of a man as\r\nwhite as paper and thin as a hair-pin, had a most salutary effect. It\r\nmade all the fellows love me more than before, even the chief, for all\r\nwere much like dogs in disposition, and a dog is the better for it when\r\nhe learns that man is the master. I was more of a monarch every day.\r\n\r\nYet I was slow in regaining my old weight, for the heat was increasing\r\nsteadily, and my system had been much depressed by the fever. In\r\nconsequence of this, I did more at playing than at work. With my fellows\r\nI practiced archery in the cooler parts of the days, coaxing back the\r\nstrength to my arms, body and legs, but I made my excursions to the\r\njungle brief.\r\n\r\nDuring this period of convalescence, the goddess reassumed the company\r\nof her snake. But the dear girl followed me about with her gaze, which I\r\nfrequently felt drawing my own. When I would glance toward her, I always\r\nsaw her glorious eyes filled with longing and sympathy and a tenderness\r\nwhich went straight to my heart. But she would blush and look away,\r\nnearly always at the hideous snake.\r\n\r\nWith my returning strength came the recurrent desire to depart from the\r\nplace forever. Also, in spite of all I could do, the thought of my\r\ngold—lying in the thicket, the treasure for which I had laboured so\r\nhard—would persist in returning. I tried to banish the dream of avarice,\r\nbut it is a fearsome clutch which riches maintain on the imagination of\r\npoor, weak man. I felt quite convinced that great as my longing was for\r\nthe world outside, that of the goddess was ten-fold greater. Of this I\r\nspoke, one day, when my restored condition gave promise that I should\r\nnot fail for lack of strength in what I might undertake. Into the eyes\r\nof that faithful girl came a burning light, which would have made the\r\nheart of any man bound with feeling. She spoke, however, with her usual\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n“I should like to leave this place,” she said, “but I prefer to wait\r\nuntil you are strong and masterful, as you were when I saw you first.”\r\n\r\nAt this it was on my tongue to speak of the future, and of certain hopes\r\nwhich had grown in my thoughts, of a home to be and of happiness, but I\r\ncurbed this desire as being untimely while she depended so entirely upon\r\nmyself for deliverance.\r\n\r\nHaving dwelt no little on the prospect of the future in this camp, in\r\nwhich—unless we escaped—I could see my own skeleton hung up on a stump,\r\nand with no fine plating of gold upon it, either, I had small desire to\r\nremain in the land another day. Strangely enough, however, I had no\r\nsooner begun to make our preparations for leaving, than memory dragged\r\nin every happy day I had spent with my Links, every thrill of triumph in\r\nmy puny successes, every faithful or affectionate deed which these\r\nsimple, half-animal creatures had ever performed toward myself. I own I\r\nwas foolishly attached to a number of the poor forest-children, who\r\nwatched me always with such a dumb look of regard, and wonder as to what\r\nI was.\r\n\r\nIt is not a boast to say that I had wrought an ineradicable effect upon\r\nthese less than merely primitive people. In turn they had been my\r\nwilling slaves, my companions—my everything of life. I thought of Little\r\nTike, and blessed his memory for the days of real enjoyment he had given\r\nme when I was mending from a serious injury once before. But after\r\nall—there was that gilded skeleton to think about and to dread. What\r\nprofit was it to a skeleton that sundry Missing Links still adored the\r\nground before it? I preferred to be a man of meat, unadored for the rest\r\nof my life, rather than to be a gold-plated pile of bones, worshipped\r\nmadly throughout the centuries to come.\r\n\r\nThus, taking matters quietly, I made myself and the boat ready for the\r\nlong, uncertain cruise. I was quite aware that we might be leaving a\r\nplace of comparative safety, for waters and lands of which the dangers\r\nmight be innumerable and the chances for escape absolutely nil; I\r\nagreed, mentally, that we might be making a terrible mistake which we\r\nwould recognise when too late for any retreat, but these were the risks\r\nwe were obliged to assume. I believed I could win, in this game with\r\nfates unknown, and virtually I wagered both our lives on the outcome of\r\nthe play.\r\n\r\nOne of my chief concerns, in stocking the boat, was that of providing\r\nwater. As long as we floated on the river we should have this in plenty,\r\nbut if we did reach the sea, matters might be altered. The best I could\r\ndo was to take my tortoise shell, to hold a fair supply. It was an easy\r\nmatter to provision ourselves with meat, for strips which I cut from\r\nvarious kinds of game, dried in the sun in a manner most satisfactory,\r\nfurnishing a palatable supply, which, with salt, was not at all bad to\r\nchew upon by the hour.\r\n\r\nFor weapons I depended on the bow and arrows, a club and a number of\r\ngood flint hatchets, in addition to four small bombs, with complement of\r\nfuse. In order to provide an ever-ready brand of fire for these, should\r\noccasion to use them arise, I selected a goodly quantity of the wood\r\nwhich retained the glow so long, after which I lined all the bow-end of\r\nthe boat with clay, so that I could build my blaze on the bottom and yet\r\ndo no harm to the hull by burning. I meant to carry my fire along, for I\r\nhad experienced all the “pic-nics” I wanted for the lack of this useful\r\nthing. Among sundry other materials, I provided myself with several\r\ncoils of good, stout line, made by braiding together the small, pliable\r\ncreepers. At this work the goddess assisted splendidly.\r\n\r\nAll the skins which had formed my gold bag, had been left behind, in my\r\nflight from the Blacks, of course, but my Links having learned the\r\nprocess of curing pelts in the brine, had worked up some very good\r\npieces. On these I levied a tax—the only one I imposed during my\r\nreign—thereby fitting the craft out in some degree of comfort, for the\r\ngoddess had dressed herself in all the hides I had left in my shelter.\r\nThis seemed to be the concluding ceremony, except that I made sure my\r\noars and thole-pins were staunch, and I cut a long slender pole, to be\r\nused for any purpose which might develope later on.\r\n\r\nMy decision was made to leave in the late afternoon, in order to pass\r\nthe camp of the Blacks after night had rendered them cowards. At the\r\nvery thought of their village, that bag of gold clamoured for another\r\nfling at fortune. I was a poor man, in my own country, howsoever wealthy\r\nI might consider myself in Linkland; the temptation was great. But I\r\nshook my head decisively. I had an undoubted right to risk my own neck,\r\nbut I had not the slightest right to risk the personal safety of a\r\nhelpless woman. No, I must shut my eyes to the glitter, and pass the\r\ntreasure by—like a man!\r\n\r\nAlthough I had made frequent excursions in my boat, many of which had\r\nrequired preparation, the Links seemed to comprehend that on this\r\noccasion the matter was one of much more importance and gravity for all\r\nconcerned. When all was ready and the hour drawing near, I attempted to\r\nconvey to the assembled tribe my intention of going, with the goddess,\r\nso far that I should never return. That they understood, I am positive;\r\nthe poor fellows were greatly affected. They regretted the arrival of\r\nthat day as plainly as if they had said so in a most solemn chorus. Even\r\nthe albino female, weak, inconsequent creature that she was, and like a\r\nwoman, would have forgiven everything and promised to be good all the\r\nrest of her days, to have changed my decision. She wept on the ground,\r\nsincerely. I felt saddened myself; I admit it freely. These rude\r\ncreatures had all seemed like my very own; they were more than faithful\r\nanimals, and yet they commanded a strange sympathy, being less than men.\r\n\r\nWhen ready to go, I carried the great rock-crystal club to the ex-chief\r\nand placed it again in his hand, as he stood there and wondered.\r\n\r\n“Take it back,” I said, as if he could understand every word, “you are\r\nman enough to wield it well. Boys,” I added to the others, “don’t go\r\nbackward again; stick to the bows, and make new ones for yourselves, to\r\nshoot the pigs. Try to be good, manly fellows. And—and I hope you won’t\r\nentirely forget me, when I’m gone.”\r\n\r\nTurning quickly away, I shouldered the gold-nugget club and started for\r\nthe boat, to which the goddess also repaired. Old Fatty was whining, as\r\nhe followed at my heels, and after him trooped every creature in the\r\ntribe, till all stood together on the shore.\r\n\r\nIn the boat was everything we needed, so far as I could plan and\r\nprovide, including a lot of the freshest fruit to be obtained. The\r\ngoddess took her seat in the stern. Seized with an impulse, I turned to\r\nmy loyal fellows and held out my hand to the chief. He was wholly at a\r\nloss to know what I meant, yet so natural is the gesture that he placed\r\nhis hand in mine without even knowing that this shake was the symbol of\r\nfriendship, greeting and farewell. The others followed his example, in\r\nwonder, and with awkward motions, so that I bade good-bye to all the\r\n“men.”\r\n\r\nFatty, who was eyeing the boat and whining and giving little jumps of\r\nindecision, knew not what to do. I stepped in the craft and pushed her\r\ngently off.\r\n\r\n“Come on then, Fatty,” I said to my good, old fellow, and bounding\r\nthrough the tepid water, he did actually leap into the boat and sit\r\nthere, shivering with awe and delight.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, old camp; good-bye, my friends,” I said, as we drifted slowly\r\naway. “God keep you, poor children of the jungle.”\r\n\r\nThe chief and all the others got down on the ground, along the bank, and\r\npaid me such a tribute of genuine esteem as I shall never know again.\r\nThis was their long farewell; this was their voluntary expression of\r\nlove and regret. At that moment, more than any other in my life, I was a\r\nking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLII\r\n                             GOLDEN GLEAMS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs long as we could see them, the Links continued to watch the boat\r\ndeparting. Even the goddess, who had conceived such a hatred and fear of\r\nthe Blacks, felt that these simpler fellows were not wholly savage and\r\nbad; she even waved them good-bye till we passed around the point, after\r\nwhich we were quiet for several minutes.\r\n\r\nOld Fatty was thoroughly frightened. He crouched down and trembled,\r\nraising his head timidly from time to time to look about, but always\r\nducked it back under his arm as if he thought that to shut out the sight\r\nwas to eliminate the imaginary danger. I pitied him, but felt a greater\r\naffection for the old fellow than ever before, to think he preferred to\r\nundergo this torture, rather than to remain behind when I had gone. It\r\nwas a wonderful compliment, and so I shall always think. But I hoped his\r\nfears would soon depart, for I was sorry to see him distressed.\r\n\r\nWhen I turned from the last view of our friends, to smile at the\r\ngoddess, I noticed for the first time that she was minus the anaconda.\r\n\r\n“Why—we’ve forgotten your darling, beastly old snake,” said I. “If it\r\nmakes a lot of difference, why—of course—”\r\n\r\n“I left it purposely,” she interrupted, rosy red.\r\n\r\n“The deuce!” I exclaimed. “I thought the critter was your pet—the one\r\nthing on earth—”\r\n\r\n“My pet! Oh, the horrible, crawling thing!” She shuddered at the memory,\r\nto my great, but secret delight. “I hated the nasty thing—I loathed it!”\r\nshe expostulated fervently. “I hope I’ll never see another snake again!”\r\n\r\nThis was a huge surprise. “Gee whizz!” said I.\r\n\r\n“Gee wizz!” echoed Fatty, and he ducked his head back with a snap.\r\n\r\n“But—er—why, then,” I resumed, “why did you lug it around?”\r\n\r\n“I took it as my only protection,” she replied with dignity. “I had to\r\nbe protected from the outrageous brutes!”\r\n\r\n“That’s so,” I admitted, abashed. “I might have thought of that. Of\r\ncourse—just as plain as day.... You’re right—I’m a donkey.... Yes....\r\nBut—but why have you thrown him away, now?”\r\n\r\n“Because,” she murmured, looking at me timidly, while she blushed again,\r\n“because I don’t need him—any more.”\r\n\r\n“Well—bless my soul!” said I, and that was all.\r\n\r\nSending the boat along steadily, for the sun had set and darkness would\r\nsoon be coming, I thought of many things. My gaze rested on Fatty, who\r\nwas now beginning to look about him a trifle more boldly. What should I\r\ndo with the old fellow, provided we all got safely out of the country\r\nand once more mingled with men? How astonished he would be at the sights\r\nof steamers, railroad trains, cities, and the hurrying crowds of people!\r\nI could fancy his comical face, as he looked in my eyes, like a\r\nbewildered dog. Would it ever be possible to put him in clothes and have\r\nhim about me? I knew he could learn many useful things, and even much of\r\nmy speech, but whether a Missing Link could really be kept, as a\r\nservant, or friend, was a question requiring no little amount of\r\nthought. Of one thing I was certain, I would never under any\r\ncircumstances permit him to become a freak, nor even an object of\r\npeople’s idle curiosity. Poor old, faithful Fatty.\r\n\r\nBy the time we arrived at Outlet river I felt that the darkness was\r\nsufficient to make it possible and safe for me to run the gauntlet past\r\nthe camp of the Blacks. Cautiously I rowed the boat, bidding the goddess\r\nsay nothing till we should be past the clearing.\r\n\r\nI could see that she had become pale and frightened, as we neared the\r\nplace in which for long she had been a prisoner, but also there was\r\nample evidence of her courage. Without a sound, we glided by the bank\r\nwhere twice I had beached the boat, and my heart beat with excitement as\r\nI thought of the gold, lying so short a carry away. “Get it—take it!”\r\nprompted a thought in my brain, “it will only take a moment and then you\r\nwill be rich!” But I conquered; I crushed out the tempting voice and\r\nrowed slowly on.\r\n\r\nProceeding across the river, to the side opposite the clearing of our\r\nfoe, I watched for the camp, eagerly. We came sooner than I had expected\r\nto a point from which we could see the place. I looked, but was struck\r\ndumb with surprise. Not a fire did I see. I rested on the oars and\r\nlistened; there was not a sound of the chattering Blacks. Daring to\r\napproach a trifle nearer, so great is human curiosity, I was still\r\nunable to discover a single sign of inhabitants on the flat where I had\r\nformerly seen them by the hundred.\r\n\r\n“I’m a fish,” said I, “if they haven’t deserted the camp!”\r\n\r\nThey had gone, for a fact. There was not a Link of them left. They had\r\nfled, for what reason I could not even conjecture; and where they were\r\nwas a question which I did not care to propound. It seemed to me that\r\nthis lifted a great burden of worry from my shoulders. But as soon as I\r\nhad made myself sure of the truth, my thoughts went flashing back to the\r\nbag of gold. If the Links were gone, I should run no risk in recovering\r\nthe treasure. So potent did this idea become, that I immediately turned\r\nthe boat back up the steam and began to row with vigour.\r\n\r\nThe goddess asked me at once where I was going. When I told her she\r\nseemed deeply to regret my resolution, but she sat there, grimly, and\r\nmade no comment. Brave girl, I knew she was terribly agitated, but a\r\ngirl could not be expected to do or to know any better. I admired her\r\npluck in restraining her natural impulse to protest and coax and make a\r\nfuss.\r\n\r\nIn the briefest time, the prow was grating on the bank. Fatty leaped\r\nout, wild with delight to find himself again on solid earth.\r\n\r\n“We’ll only be gone a minute,” I told the goddess, and led the way up\r\nthrough the brush and the darkness.\r\n\r\nTo tell the truth I was more than half afraid that something might\r\nhappen, myself. Jungle noises had commenced and the place seemed to\r\nbreathe of my flight, struggles and pains of the time before. Stumbling\r\nabout, as silently as possible, I began to search for the treasure.\r\n\r\nI had pictured myself walking straight to where the gold was lying, but\r\nI now began to realise that to re-discover the particular thicket where\r\nI had dropped it would be a matter involving considerable luck. A\r\nfruitless time elapsed while I plunged about. Fatty was of no\r\nassistance, for he knew nothing of what I was seeking.\r\n\r\nPresently the same old grumble and roar, from the mighty cauldron,\r\ncommenced to roll outward on the air. I knew at once I was off the\r\ntrack, at least twenty yards. Changing my base rapidly, I began the\r\nsearch anew. But it seemed utterly hopeless. A doubt came over me; was\r\nthe bag still there? Might not the Blacks have found it and carried it\r\naway? It seemed as if this must be so. I was worried about the goddess;\r\nif anything should happen to her, how terrible it would be!\r\n\r\nOn the point of giving up the gold, and persuading myself that I did not\r\ncare anyway, I turned to leave, and stumbled heavily over some obstacle\r\nand into a tangle of creepers.\r\n\r\n“Here it is, all the time!” I grumbled.\r\n\r\nMy excitement rose to fever pitch in a second. The bag, exactly as I had\r\ndropped it down, was under my very hand. Lifting it out of the embracing\r\ntendrils, I got it boosted up on my shoulder in a hurry. Then back we\r\nplunged, through the growth.\r\n\r\nIf I live to be a thousand, I shall never see a face so expressive of\r\ndread and fright as was that of the poor, trembling girl in the boat,\r\nwhen at last we came to where she was waiting. I believe that hers had\r\nbeen a more cruel ordeal to endure than had been my own on the former\r\noccasion. I had not even thought to whistle a bit, by way of assurance\r\nthat all was well. She had to cry, dear little woman, when the strain\r\nwas over and the boat once more headed down the stream.\r\n\r\nI spurned the gold with my foot, as it lay in the boat, and hated myself\r\nfor a miserly, greedy fool, yet in spite of myself I felt a tremendous\r\nelation inside, to think of having all this wealth, after all. It seemed\r\ntoo good for me to contain myself over. I wanted to roar out in\r\nlaughter, to sing, and to shout a mad defiance to all the Blacks in\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nFatty had entered the boat again, with more alacrity than before,\r\ndesiring any fate with us rather than to be left alone in an unknown\r\njungle after dark. He made himself small in the bottom of the boat, and\r\nwe glided past the deserted camp of our defeated foe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XLIII\r\n                        SURROUNDED BY THE BLACKS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a strange sensation to skim along that river through the dark,\r\nirregular walls of trees, for the sounds of the jungle came to us\r\nclearly and these were all we could hear. At times we could see but a\r\nshort distance ahead; at many a bend it appeared as if the great silent\r\nwater-way ended abruptly. Then again it would open out and curve away,\r\nlighted only by its own reflections of the stars.\r\n\r\nSo much did this outlet wind that I lost all account of directions, but\r\nI knew we were traversing miles to accomplish but little direct advance.\r\nOur talking amounted to nothing. My mood was not for conversation, while\r\nI am sure the goddess dreaded to speak a word. From time to time some\r\nwater creature splashed its way among the grasses, next the bank. No\r\nmatter how often this sound was repeated, it made me start and breathe\r\nheavily till we were past the place.\r\n\r\nThe hours sped by, bringing no material change that could be noted. The\r\nnight was exceedingly dark, owing in part to the density of the forest\r\nso near on either side. Pausing at length in my rowing, I observed that\r\nwe drifted more rapidly than I had thought the current to be moving.\r\nHaving become a trifle soft, while on my back, I found that my arms had\r\ngrown tired already from the work. Fatty had succumbed to his habit of\r\nsleeping, acquired by going to bed at dark. His fears, however, had kept\r\nhim awake much later than usual. He was curled down in the hold, where\r\nhe twitched his feet and made little noises, like a dog that dreams.\r\n\r\nI whispered to the goddess that she had better try to follow Fatty’s\r\nexample, but I was quite unable to ascertain whether she slept or not,\r\nso still had she been for an hour. Deeming it wise to conserve my\r\nstrength for the daylight rowing, I now permitted the boat to float down\r\nthe river at its own speed, merely keeping her out toward the centre of\r\nthe stream by steering with one or the other of the oars. She swung\r\nabout, broadside on, but as this enabled me to watch ahead easily, I\r\nmade no effort to keep her pointed directly down the current.\r\n\r\nDrifting thus, I kept the lonely vigil, hour after hour. I think I have\r\nnever felt more depressed than I finally became in that heart of the\r\nwilderness. Not that anything threatened, nor that the sounds about me\r\nwere more than usually weird, but simply because there seemed to be no\r\nend in promise; there appeared to be no progress toward anything\r\ndifferent from that interminable jungle, in which the river seemed\r\nmerely to wind without purpose. I felt as if the stream were like a\r\nfigure 8, on which we could float forever and never get out of the maze.\r\nI knew better than this, but everything contributed to make me hopeless.\r\nSleepy and weary, dully aching in the muscles and bones made weak by the\r\nfever, I almost thought the whole business a failure and the life, for\r\nwhich I had fought so persistently, a mockery unworthy of the effort.\r\n\r\nOn and on, winding and curving, drifted the boat with its extraordinary\r\ncargo. Now and again I stirred the embers of fire, which were dully\r\nglowing in my furnace-like receptacle of clay. In this place these\r\nburning sticks appeared like the eyes of some crouching animal. I gave\r\nup all idea of ever seeing dawn. Nodding, jerking myself awake, bathing\r\nmy heavy lids with water, steering my crooked course on this stream of\r\nmystery, I passed the time without a single relieving incident to break\r\nthe deadening monotony of sound, motion and thought.\r\n\r\nEven when the first yellow streaks of morning did make slits in the\r\nclouds, above the horizon of trees, it seemed as if the process of\r\nday-breaking ceased and that the actuator had forgotten the method.\r\nAbout this time, a rain commenced to fall, light, but wet and not\r\ndesired. Fatty and the goddess awoke. I stumbled over the faithful Link\r\nto arrange a protection for the fire, which might otherwise have been\r\nextinguished. Then in my eagerness to get back to the oars and head us\r\noff from the bank, toward which we were gliding, I forgot to cover the\r\nbombs.\r\n\r\nGrateful for the diversion, as well as for the company of my two\r\ncompanions, I picked up my spirits rapidly, becoming actually cheerful.\r\nThis humour seemed to accelerate the coming of morning amazingly. The\r\nriver reflected the pale streaks of light, the trees began to emerge in\r\ndetail from the walls of gloom, and the dismal sounds, of hooting and\r\nhowling things, were abated. Before we knew it, day was upon us, our\r\nwinding course became a ceaseless invitation to hasten on and round the\r\nnext succeeding curve, and we were drifting with a doubled speed.\r\n\r\nThough the rain continued to fall, it was not annoying. I ate a bit of\r\nfruit and manned the oars, soon having us going at an encouraging speed.\r\nWhen the sun peered over the edge of the world, I felt like a boy. I let\r\nout a shout and a roar to relieve the pressure of over exhilaration. The\r\nechoes chased through the jungle madly.\r\n\r\nGlancing ahead I now discovered that the river narrowed down abruptly\r\nbetween rude stairways of rock. On either side were shelves of the\r\nadamant, not more than a foot above the tide; the whole gateway was\r\nbarely more than six feet in width. As might have been expected the\r\ncurrent was fairly being sucked through this chasm, which explained the\r\nextra speed of the current where we were.\r\n\r\nSeeing nothing in or about the place which should make it difficult of\r\nnavigation, I merely kept the boat headed for the centre of the pass and\r\nlet her shoot along with the powerful sweep of waters. The place was not\r\nlong, nor were the rocks high nor difficult of access from the banks\r\nbelow. I remember to have thought how easily a man could cross the river\r\nat this peculiar place by simply jumping.\r\n\r\nThe boat was tossed on the turbulent surface, as we darted through, but\r\nbelow was another broad, smooth expanse, and the ever-inevitable curve\r\nof the river. This latter we reached soon. I was then somewhat surprised\r\nto observe two things: First, that for several hundred feet the stream\r\nwas nearly straight, and second that it narrowed again below us, between\r\nbanks a yard in height on which the growth was dense and which were so\r\nclose together that several slender creepers hung like the cables of a\r\nprojected suspension bridge across the stream, from branch to branch. I\r\nthought the wind must have blown the first slight tendrils over and that\r\nlater they had grown to their present size. I also noted that again the\r\nplacid river became rapids, which tossed and foamed in their agitated\r\nplunge between these banks.\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in what I saw and watching my course narrowly, I gave no heed\r\nto anything else. Therefore I started with galvanic quickness at a\r\nsudden scream from the goddess. In answer, a chorus of yells,\r\ntriumphant, and diabolical enough to curdle the blood in one’s veins,\r\nwent up instantly. Then the jungle below us appeared literally to swarm\r\nwith terrible forms.\r\n\r\nThe black Links, dancing like maniacs, screaming and racing toward the\r\nrapids to intercept us, were surging from every possible space between\r\nthe trees, on the left-hand side of the river. They dashed ahead, fully\r\ncomprehending the situation and their own advantage. I thought I could\r\nbeat them to the rapids, but they were there by the score before we\r\ncould approach within a stone’s throw of its top, a fierce and terrible\r\narray, armed with their clubs with which they could not have missed us\r\nby throwing.\r\n\r\nTo have attempted to run through the narrows would merely have been to\r\ncourt a sudden death. I backwatered quickly and held the boat from\r\ndrifting. Fatty was whining; the goddess was white as paper. I thought\r\nof the rapids above us, against the current of which I could not have\r\npulled the boat to save our souls. I looked about and noted the densely\r\nwooded banks, which made escape in that direction impossible, even if we\r\ncould have landed on the side opposite the foe in the vain hope that\r\nthey could not get across as easily as we.\r\n\r\nWe were trapped!\r\n\r\nThe wild brutes, insane to get the goddess again in their clutches, mad\r\nto tear Fatty in shreds, and crazy to beat me to a pulp, as their\r\narch-nemesis, simply writhed in eager anticipation of bagging us all, in\r\nspite of all we could do.\r\n\r\nIt was maddening; it all but drove me out of my senses. I knew that to\r\nwait for night would mean that when they were goaded sufficiently by\r\ntheir own impatience, the monsters would reach us, even if they had to\r\nswim, in addition to which I should certainly not dare to run the rapids\r\nafter dark. Escape was utterly impossible, turn where I might.\r\n\r\nThe greed for gold had done the trick! The time I had wasted to get it\r\nwould have saved us. Had I not delayed, we should have passed this place\r\nbefore the light had become strong enough to reveal our presence.\r\n\r\nThe demons never ceased for a moment to yell. That they knew we were\r\ncaught I could not doubt. Not only did the males all congregate to smash\r\nus to atoms if we should attempt to shoot the rapids, but the females\r\nalso appeared like magic from the jungle and lined up along the bank, a\r\ncruel looking mob with fingers that itched to tear poor Fatty and me to\r\nstrings of meat. I was alarmed, desperate, and enraged by turns. Keeping\r\noff the boat and attempting to see a way out, I suddenly thought of my\r\nbombs.\r\n\r\nImmediately I conceived a plan by which I meant to scatter the fiends in\r\nutter dismay. Dropping the boat down toward them I stopped it just\r\noutside the range of their clubs and headed it back up the stream.\r\nBefore it had ceased to go forward, under the impulse of a powerful\r\nstroke, I shipped the oars, grabbed up a bomb and darted over Fatty to\r\nthe fire. Snatching up an ember, I applied it to the fuse, meaning to\r\nthrow the deadly explosive into their midst and dart through the rapids\r\nin the instantaneous confusion which would follow.\r\n\r\nBut the rain had dampened the powder!\r\n\r\nThe fuse would not ignite! The trick was worse than a failure!\r\n\r\nWith a curse on my lips, I sprang back to the oars and spun the boat\r\nabout, barely in time to save it from shooting the narrows broadside on.\r\nA dozen clubs, whizzing and hurtling end over end, splashed the water\r\nabout us, as I drove the boat back to a safe position. In despair I\r\nexamined all the bombs, only to find them as useless and harmless as so\r\nmany hunks of cork. All my elaborate work to provide myself with these\r\nweapons and with the fire to make them of use, had been wholly undone in\r\na moment of thoughtless neglect. I might have protected these\r\ninstruments of death, but I had failed at the critical moment.\r\n\r\nThe weight of this calamity nearly overcame me. It seemed as if the\r\nbombs had been our only hope, and that now we were certainly doomed. The\r\nraging Blacks yelled more horribly than ever; they were more assured of\r\ntheir prey. Nothing more ferocious can be imagined than this mass of\r\nfiends, many of them foaming at the mouth, all excitedly moving from\r\nplace to place, and all showing fangs of teeth, as they watched us with\r\nthe nervous, near-together eyes which I knew so well.\r\n\r\nI was rendered so thoroughly unfit by the failure of my bombs, that I\r\ngave up trying to think of any other way of outwitting the monsters. The\r\nrain re-commenced. With a bitter sniff of scorn at myself for the\r\naction, I covered the bamboo explosives with a skin, to prevent them\r\nfrom getting any wetter. As if powder could be any wetter when it has\r\nbecome too damp to ignite!\r\n\r\n“Oh what shall we do? what shall we do?” moaned the goddess.\r\n\r\nI tried to answer cheerfully, but having no sensible reply was denied\r\neven this negative pleasure. I tried to think, in order to make some\r\nrejoinder.\r\n\r\n“There is only one scheme and that is nearly hopeless,” I told her at\r\nlast. “If I can make them believe we are about to land on the opposite\r\nside, up above, perhaps they might abandon their present position and\r\nthen we could make a dash for it and beat them past that narrow\r\nchannel.”\r\n\r\nShe made no comment, but in her eyes there was such an imploring light\r\nthat I deemed no effort too great to make. Somewhat inspirited by the\r\nplan concocted on the spur of a moment, I strung my bow and laid an\r\narrow near and immediately turning the prow up stream began to row away\r\nfrom the waiting Blacks, toward the furthest bank we could see.\r\n\r\nAt first they were undecided, or else they refused to believe we were\r\nleaving. But their wits were keen only within narrow limits. Taking the\r\nbait, in a moment, they seemed suddenly to remember the rock-passage,\r\nover which they doubtless knew they could jump. By the score they chased\r\nup the bank, swinging along in the trees with astonishing agility and\r\ngaining on us every moment.\r\n\r\nI was purposely rowing slowly, but with great show of exertion. As far\r\nas I could determine, from that distance, every demon in the tribe came\r\nchasing up the river, to be in at the death. Dozens of them remained\r\nvisible, marking the position of the main body as it moved up the bank,\r\nbut the great majority were soon hidden in the tangle of verdure,\r\nthrough which they weaved like so many animated black shuttles, playing\r\nin and out through the warp of green.\r\n\r\nSteering now for the bank which was just below the upper rapids, and\r\nappearing to row with all possible haste, I had the extreme satisfaction\r\nof seeing our mad pursuers swarming toward the rocks where the stream\r\ncould be leaped at a bound. So eagerly did they push and crowd, when\r\nthey came to the place, that some, who paused undecided at the brink,\r\nwere shoved headlong into the angry current. But no sooner was I sure\r\nthat the ruse had succeeded than I swung the boat, as if she had been on\r\na pivot, and sent her shooting down the stream with might and main.\r\n\r\nShrieks of rage and dismay burst from a hundred throats as the baffled\r\ndemons suddenly comprehended my game. With all their speed, and in a\r\nfrenzy of fury, they came running and climbing and swinging back. But\r\nthis time I had the double advantage of a shorter, straighter route and\r\nthe force of all the current to sweep me along. I rowed like an engine;\r\nthe race was a race for life or death. Every muscle was strained, every\r\nvolt of the superhuman dynamic, developed by the peril of our position,\r\nsurged upward to drive us onward, toward that narrow gate of safety.\r\n\r\nWe neared it; we were far ahead of the mob; I saw victory smiling in the\r\nsun-lit jungle beyond. Like a hideous black comet, then, athwart my line\r\nof vision, a Link suddenly swung across the river, on one of the\r\ncreepers that spanned the space between the banks. He reached the\r\nbranches on the opposite side. Instantly another one followed. I\r\ngroaned, for evidently they had been left there to guard the pass.\r\nAnother and yet another swung across. They quickly formed a\r\n“monkey-bridge” and hung suspended above the water like a sagging\r\nhammock—not from the creepers, which would have broken, but each from\r\nthe arms of his neighbour. In less than half a minute their line was\r\ncomplete. We were still driving toward them.\r\n\r\n“Oh, the horrible old woman!” cried the girl, in affright.\r\n\r\nI realised then that more than half the creatures in the bridge were\r\nfemales; and out across them came swinging that she-devil who had caught\r\nme with the gold, and whose fingers I had severed, and whose ribs I had\r\nskinned—the harpy who had watched the goddess like a hawk.\r\n\r\nShe meant to lean down over the ones in the bridge and clutch the girl,\r\nas we shot beneath their bodies. Then others quickly joined her who\r\nintended to snatch for Fatty and myself. It was diabolically clever. If\r\never they reached us with those powerful arms, they could hold us\r\nagainst a team of pulling horses.\r\n\r\nTo turn now meant to abandon all hope; the Links who were tearing after\r\nus behind, once fooled could be hoaxed no more; and all would be more\r\nthan ever infuriated and likely to swamp the boat. It looked like a\r\nswift and awful death.\r\n\r\nIn a heat of uncontainable rage myself, I stood up, as we swept toward\r\nthe rapids, and grabbing my bow, strung an arrow in desperate haste and\r\ndrew for a shot, which fury made vicious and fierce. I had become so\r\nangered that I seemed to care nothing for what could happen. The arrow\r\nsprang away like a streak of light. Just at that second the line of\r\nLinks slipped down a foot. In the brief time before the shaft could\r\narrive, my heart sank with dread—the slip of the target had ruined my\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nBut like the angered messenger of hate which it was, the arrow struck\r\nwhere it had not been aimed—in the forearm of a Link who supported the\r\nweight of all the line. It stabbed clean through, tearing the muscles\r\nsavagely as it plowed. Down swung the whole living bridge of demons,\r\nwith the shrieking “old woman” in the melee, for that supporting arm let\r\ngo as if it had been slashed in twain.\r\n\r\nInstantly the dropping fiends struck the stream where the current boiled\r\nlike a mill-race. Splashing, battling, screaming in fright, the\r\nintertwisted monsters went swiftly down, every one trying to climb out\r\non his neighbour, all of them fighting, rolling like rags of waste and\r\ngurgling as they attempted still to yell, with mouths full of water.\r\n\r\nThe boat by this time had been caught in the tow of the torrent. We\r\nswung down into the foam and tossing waves and drifted into the mass of\r\nbrutes as they fought and drowned in the irresistible flood. Two of them\r\nflung an arm across our gunwale. Yelling as madly as themselves, we beat\r\nthem off with the clubs, Fatty fighting like a fury. The hideous old\r\nfemale clutched in desperation and fastened her deadly grip on the wrist\r\nof the goddess. What a scream of malice and triumph she gave! I jumped\r\nacross the seat and struck her arm a blow that smashed the bone and\r\nflesh to a quivering pulp on the edge of the boat. About her neck was\r\nflung the arm of a drowning beast at her side; and down they went\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nYells upon yells now arose from the other Blacks, who had come to the\r\nnarrows. We were slowly revolving in a whirlpool. The creatures could\r\nstill have dashed to positions above us and sunk the boat with their\r\nclubs. I shot out the oars and drove the craft quickly ahead. A monster\r\ncame boiling to the surface; I slashed him hard with my right-hand sweep\r\nand he sank like a rock. One, a rod away was swimming with the inborn\r\nskill and instinct of all wild animals, but the others had fought one\r\nanother, fatally, in that vortex of swirling water, and only this one\r\ngot back to the bank.\r\n\r\nThrough the seething foam to where the turbulent river grew calmer, we\r\nsped away, and at last these implacable demons were far behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLIV\r\n                          VALE, FAITHFUL FATTY\r\n\r\n\r\nHad the Blacks known the country and human ways of cunning, they could\r\nstill have cut across the neck of a loop in the river, and so have\r\novertaken the boat, but this was beyond their sagacity. I feared they\r\nmight have forestalled us thus, so that when we came along to where they\r\nshould have been, in such an event, I was alert for trouble and hugged\r\nthe further side of the stream. Of course we passed the place\r\nunmolested.\r\n\r\nThe sun was shining brightly now, as if in promise of fairer things to\r\ncome. We had been too horrified to speak, but at last we breathed our\r\nrelief, and shuddered as we reviewed the fearful hour which, thank God,\r\nwas now of the past. Then we ate of our food, for all were faint from\r\nhunger, and I stirred up and fed the fire, and laid out the bombs to dry\r\nin the tropical heat. Also I moored the boat from the branch of an\r\noverhanging tree, by means of the rope I had taken along. I needed rest\r\nas much as food.\r\n\r\nThere in the shade we floated quietly for more than an hour, during\r\nwhich time I slept like a worn-out child, in a wretched position, but\r\nyet dreamlessly and without the slightest inconvenience. I awoke much\r\nrefreshed. The goddess would have permitted me to slumber as long as I\r\nlisted, nevertheless she was anxious to be going ahead, seeing which I\r\ncut us loose, and again we were hurrying down toward the sea.\r\n\r\nIt was a long and somewhat tedious day. We shot more rapids, a number of\r\nwhich threatened various dangers, and we rowed through a broad, shallow\r\nlagoon that was almost a lake and in which there were alligators galore.\r\nOf these the goddess had a natural horror, only exceeded by that of poor\r\nFatty. However, the saurians were quite as alarmed as we, having never\r\nbefore seen the like of our floating terror, which the boat with\r\nextended oars seemed to represent, so that we cleared this place without\r\ndelay and without a battle.\r\n\r\nAlong the banks of the river, which presented itself in multitudinous\r\naspects, we beheld troops of monkeys and apes, vast flocks of parrots\r\nand other noisy birds, which made the trees seem to quiver with life.\r\nTortoises were frequently started from a sun-bath, when they plunged\r\ninto the stream with clumsy haste. There were toads in great variety and\r\nof snakes an ample representation. Of these latter reptiles some were\r\nswimming in the water, while others lay upon the banks and others again\r\nhung suspended from the trees, masquerading, it appeared to me, in\r\nimitation of creepers. The insects were exceedingly pestiferous,\r\nespecially where the river became wide, sluggish and grown with rank\r\ngrasses.\r\n\r\nThe changing panorama of jungle, hills, grassy clearings and rocky\r\nravines, was one of unquestionable beauty, yet I felt no joy in\r\nobserving it stretch and unfold so endlessly before us. I waxed\r\nimpatient to be out of the maze. In spite of all I could do, I was\r\nconscious always of the ominous stillness about us, and of a sub-stratum\r\nof fear in myself, as I dwelt upon the thought of things which might\r\noccur. I have said before, and I repeat frankly, I am not a courageous\r\nman. The constant succession of events and the omnipresence of menace to\r\nlife and limb had wrought sad havoc with my nerves. When I fought, it\r\nwas nearly always because I felt so frightened and nervous that I had to\r\ndo something desperate to relieve my feelings. At other times anger had\r\nmade me reckless.\r\n\r\nWe had passed a number of tributary streams, so that the river was now\r\nof much greater volume. Thinking of this, I was deeply puzzled, at noon,\r\nto find that not only had the current ceased to assist me forward, but\r\nthat on the contrary it seemed abruptly to have reversed. Attributing\r\nthis “illusion” to my weakened condition of brain and muscles, I worked\r\nharder than before to drive the boat along. There was no sense in\r\nblaming myself, however, for soon the up current became actually\r\nvisible, as well as strong. Then I was suddenly made glad, and knew I\r\nhad been once more a dunce.\r\n\r\nThe tide from the great sea itself was rising and driving everything up,\r\nagainst the flow of the river. This glorious news I imparted at once to\r\nthe goddess. How she rejoiced! But even then, her feelings were most\r\nexpressed by her lustrous eyes, for she found it difficult to speak of\r\nescape, and I think she dared not hope, for fear a jealous fate would\r\nhear her wish and proceed to shatter every possibility of deliverance\r\nfrom this wide-open prison.\r\n\r\nIt being a useless expenditure of energy to pull against this tide, I\r\nsecured the boat to a vine-covered log, which protruded above the water,\r\nand let her swing as she would. We refreshed ourselves again with the\r\nfruits and a bit of the jerked meat. Already many of the mangoes and\r\npapaws were becoming soft, in the heat. Instructing the goddess to wake\r\nme the moment the tide should turn, I snatched another nap.\r\n\r\nBefore long we were slipping so swiftly downward on the ebb of the\r\ncurrent that I was quite content to steer the boat and let it make its\r\nown pace. Thus we skimmed rapidly along until late in the day, the smell\r\nof the life-giving sea wafting to our nostrils, till it filled us with\r\njoy unspeakable. Building my plan as we rode on the bosom of the river,\r\nI decided to make the camp in the stream, or on the bank, within the\r\nmouth of the outlet, rather than to venture on the ocean with night\r\ndescending. After a needed period of rest, we could explore the coast of\r\nthe land for a village, in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe sky had become a trifle clouded before we resumed the drifting,\r\nafter my slumber; this condition now increased. Having been taught my\r\nlesson before, I did not intend to be caught again. I spoke to the\r\ngoddess, asking her to steer us a bit, but the poor girl had fallen\r\nasleep from exhaustion. Letting the craft take her course, I stretched a\r\nprotection over the fire and then turned about and performed a similar\r\nservice for the bombs, which had been dried thoroughly.\r\n\r\nWhile I was fairly in the midst of this important business, Fatty gave a\r\nsudden cry of alarm. The next instant the boat struck upon the end of a\r\nspit of land which projected out into the stream. I was thrown on my\r\nknees; the craft swung with her bow as a pivot on the sand.\r\n\r\nGetting erect with the thought that no harm was done and that to push\r\noff was only the work of a second, I was amazed to see a troop of\r\ncreatures darting toward us—my old enemies the hideous ourang-outangs!\r\n\r\nThe goddess was jolted awake; she gasped in terror. Reaching for an oar\r\nto push us off I found it caught in the skin that wrapped the bombs. I\r\njerked and wrenched; the delay was fatal. The monsters descended the\r\nbank like an avalanche. Hampered as I was with the oar, I became the\r\neasiest victim. Before I could drop the sweep to make a fight, the\r\nbrutes leaped across the beach which was between themselves and the\r\nboat. Myself, the girl and Fatty were all but surrounded,—hideous murder\r\nloomed before us in a second.\r\n\r\nThen Fatty, the faithful, the frightened, the loving, hurled himself\r\nupon the brutes, defending me from instant capture and death; and the\r\nfierce creatures gathered him to them. They tore him, bit him, fell upon\r\nhim and mangled his body in a manner frightful to see. He was done to\r\ndeath most horribly in less than half a minute.\r\n\r\nThe boat, relieved of his weight and shoved by the backward push of his\r\nfoot, as he leaped, swung off in the stream and began to drift away. I\r\nsprang to where my bombs were lying, mad for vengeance, and tore one out\r\nof the skin. Then scrambling to the fire, I snatched up a flesh-searing\r\ncoal and touched the fuse. It sputtered in swift anger. I threw the\r\ndeadly thing with all my force. While yet in the air, only mid-way\r\nbetween those monsters and ourselves, the bomb exploded with terrific\r\nviolence. I saw a gigantic star of fire; I felt as if the world had\r\nburst against my head. Then I fell forward in the boat and was utterly\r\nblotted out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XLV\r\n                            NO LONGER A KING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe force of the bomb must have been tremendous. I believe it was hours\r\nbefore I regained consciousness. When at last I did revive, I was dizzy\r\nand deafened, the world about me was black, a storm was raging in the\r\nheavens and the boat was heaving with a great commotion. Everything was\r\npuzzling. Finally I remembered something of what had happened and knew\r\nwhere I was.\r\n\r\n“Dearest,” I said, giving the goddess the name which I had only dared to\r\ncall her to myself, “dearest—are you there?” and I crawled toward the\r\nstern.\r\n\r\n“Here—John,” said a faint, sweet voice, and then I found her hand and\r\nknew that she too had been long unconscious, after that moment of\r\nterrible things.\r\n\r\nWe were on the sea! Of that I was soon made sure. The wind was driving\r\nus—the Lord only knew where; the waves were tossing the boat about as if\r\nshe had been but a thimble afloat; and the spray flung across us and\r\ndrenched us both repeatedly. This had doubtless fetched us around, the\r\ngoddess first, for she had been less injured than I by the explosion,\r\nhaving been seated, while I was standing, at the fateful moment. The\r\ntide had carried us straight out to the ocean, as we lay helpless in the\r\ncraft.\r\n\r\nWe crouched in the bottom of the boat and clung to the seat for an age.\r\nThe rain came driving down; the force of the gale appeared to increase,\r\nand we scudded away into the black abyss which had for its limits the\r\nends of mighty ocean.\r\n\r\nWe were out of our prison, adrift on the boundless main. When morning\r\ncame, we raised our heads and searched that wilderness of water—in vain.\r\nNo island—no ship—nothing was there in sight, save tumbling mountains of\r\nwater. We were lost in that trackless jungle of billows.\r\n\r\nOf the day and the night of physical and mental anguish that followed, I\r\nhave no desire to think. Two souls made one by sufferings long endured,\r\nwe sought and found our only consolation in the words of hope and\r\naffection, which each could give to each.\r\n\r\nWhat water remained, or had been collected from the downpour, in the\r\nshell of the tortoise, got slopped out soon in the boat. It mingled with\r\nthe salt water, shipped from time to time, and swashing about, ruined\r\nthe meat and fruits, put out the fire and soaked the skins. Then the sun\r\nand the scorching air played their tricks at parching and burning us up.\r\nHow useless and vain seemed the sack of gold, lying there in the wash!\r\n\r\nI cut and broke the pole I had taken along, and lashing the shorter\r\npiece across the boat, to the oar-lock pins, made the other stand\r\nupright, with a bit of skin flapping idly, for a signal of distress.\r\n\r\nToward the evening of the second day we sighted a steamer. As we were\r\nlow to the water and they were high, this boat was comparatively near\r\nbefore we saw her loom above the horizon. She made us out, at last, and\r\nwe breathed our thanks, to see her put about and bear down toward the\r\ngood old boat which had served so nobly.\r\n\r\nThen it was that a surge of feeling welled up within me, thoughts of my\r\nlong exile, the friendly Links—who had saved my life,—and of poor old\r\nFatty, who had sacrificed himself like a hero at the end—poor old Fatty,\r\nmy loving and beloved friend.\r\n\r\n“What is it, John?” said the goddess tenderly.\r\n\r\n“Oh nothing,” I faltered, swallowing hard at the lump in my throttle,\r\n“I—I was just thinking that now—that now I’m no longer King of the\r\nMissing Links;—I’m just an ordinary man.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Transcriber’s Notes\r\n\r\n\r\n--Copyright notice provided as in the original—this e-text is public\r\n  domain in the country of publication.\r\n\r\n--Silently corrected palpable typos; left non-standard (or amusing)\r\n  spellings, dialect, and idiosyncratic punctuation unchanged.\r\n\r\n--In the text versions, delimited italics text in _underscores_ (the\r\n  HTML version reproduces the font form of the printed book.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Crystal Sceptre, by Philip Verrill Mighels",
