A. Craig, D.V.M.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frontispiece--INSANITARY DAIRY STABLE AND YARDS. DISEASE AND\r\nFINANCIAL LOSS ARE TO BE EXPECTED WHEN FARM ANIMALS ARE KEPT IN FILTHY,\r\nINSANITARY QUARTERS]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\nIn preparing the material for this book, the author has endeavored to\r\narrange and discuss the subject matter in a way to be of the greatest\r\nservice and help to the agricultural student and stockman, and place at\r\ntheir disposal a text and reference book.\r\n\r\nThe general discussions at the beginning of the different sections and\r\nchapters, and the discussions of the different diseases are naturally\r\nbrief. An effort has been made to conveniently arrange the topics for both\r\npractical and class-room work. The chapters have been grouped under the\r\nnecessary heads, with review questions at the end of each chapter, and the\r\nbook divided into seven parts.\r\n\r\nThe chapters on diseases of the locomotory organs, the teeth, surgical\r\ndiseases and castration, although not commonly discussed in books of this\r\nclass, the writer believes will be of value for reference and instructional\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWhen used as a text-book, it will be well for the instructor to supplement\r\nthe text with class-room discussions.\r\n\r\nThe writer has given special emphasis to the cause and prevention of\r\ndisease, and not so much to the medicinal treatment. Stockmen are not\r\nexpected to practise the medicinal treatment, but rather the preventive\r\ntreatment of disease. For this reason it is not deemed advisable to give a\r\nlarge number of formulas for the preparation of medicinal mixtures to be\r\nused for the treatment of disease, but such treatment is suggested in the\r\nmost necessary cases.\r\n\r\nR.

The morbid processes that result in either slight or\r\nmarked modifications of the normal condition are recognized by the\r\ninjurious changes in the structure or function of the organ, or group of\r\nbody organs involved. The increase in the secretion of urine noticeable in\r\nhorses in the late fall and winter is caused by the cool weather and the\r\ndecrease in the perspiration. If, however, the increase in the quantity of\r\nurine secreted occurs independently of any normal cause and is accompanied\r\nby an unthrifty and weakened condition of the animal, it would then\r\ncharacterize disease. Tissues may undergo changes in order to adapt\r\nthemselves to different environments, or as a means of protecting\r\nthemselves against injuries. The coat of a horse becomes heavy and appears\r\nrough if the animal is exposed to severe cold. A rough, staring coat is\r\nvery common in horses affected by disease. The outer layer of the skin\r\nbecomes thickened when subject to pressure or friction from the harness.\r\nThis change in structure is purely protective and normal. In disease the\r\ndeviation from normal must be more permanent in character than it is in the\r\nexamples mentioned above, and in some way prove injurious to the body\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION.--We may divide diseases into three classes: _non-specific,\r\nspecific_ and _parasitic_.\r\n\r\n_Non-specific diseases_ have no constant cause. A variety of causes may\r\nproduce the same disease. For example, acute indigestion may be caused by a\r\nchange of diet, watering the animal after feeding grain, by exhaustion and\r\nintestinal worms. Usually, but one of the animals in the stable or herd is\r\naffected. If several are affected, it is because all have been subject to\r\nthe same condition, and not because the disease has spread from one animal\r\nto another.\r\n\r\n_Specific Diseases._--The terms infectious and contagious are used in\r\nspeaking of specific diseases. Much confusion exists in the popular use of\r\nthese terms. A _contagious_ disease is one that may be transmitted by\r\npersonal contact, as, for example, influenza, glanders and hog-cholera. As\r\nthese diseases may be produced by indirect contact with the diseased animal\r\nas well as by direct, they are also _infectious_. There are a few germ\r\ndiseases that are not spread by the healthy animals coming in direct\r\ncontact with the diseased animal, as, for example, black leg and southern\r\ncattle fever. These are purely infectious diseases. Infection is a more\r\ncomprehensive term than contagion, as it may be used in alluding to all\r\ngerm diseases, while the use of the term contagion is rightly limited to\r\nsuch diseases as are produced principally through individual contact.\r\n\r\n_Parasitic diseases_ are very common among domestic animals. This class of\r\ndisease is caused by insects and worms, as for example, lice, mites, ticks,\r\nflies, and round and flat worms that live at the expense of their hosts.\r\nThey may invade any of the organs of the body, but most commonly inhabit\r\nthe digestive tract and skin. Some of the parasitic insects, mosquitoes,\r\nflies and ticks, act as secondary hosts for certain animal microorganisms\r\nthat they transmit to healthy individuals through the punctures or the\r\nbites that they are capable of producing in the skin.\r\n\r\nCAUSES.--For convenience we may divide the causes of disease into the\r\npredisposing or indirect, and the exciting or direct.\r\n\r\n_The predisposing causes_ are such factors as tend to render the body more\r\nsusceptible to disease or favor the presence of the exciting cause. For\r\nexample, an animal that is narrow chested and lacking in the development of\r\nthe vital organs lodged in the thoracic cavity, when exposed to the same\r\ncondition as the other members of the herd, may contract disease while the\r\nanimals having better conformation do not (Fig. 1). Hogs confined in\r\nwell-drained yards and pastures that are free from filth, and fed in pens\r\nand on feeding floors that are clean, do not become hosts for large numbers\r\nof parasites. Hogs confined in filthy pens are frequently so badly infested\r\nwith lice and intestinal worms that their health and thriftiness are\r\nseriously interfered with. In the first case mentioned the predisposition\r\nto disease is in the individual, and in the second case it is in the\r\nsurroundings (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Side and posterior view of bull showing\r\nconformation favorable to the development of disease.]\r\n\r\n_The exciting causes_ are the immediate causes of the particular disease.\r\nExciting causes usually operate through the environment. With the exception\r\nof the special disease-producing germs, the most common exciting causes are\r\nfaulty food and faulty methods of feeding. The following predisposing\r\ncauses of disease may be mentioned:\r\n\r\n_Age_ is an important factor in the production of disease. Young and\r\nimmature animals are more prone to attacks of infectious diseases than are\r\nold and mature animals. Hog-cholera usually affects the young hogs in the\r\nherd first, while scours, suppurative joint disease and infectious sore\r\nmouth are diseases that occur during the first few days or few weeks of the\r\nanimal's life. Lung and intestinal parasites are more commonly found in the\r\nyoung, growing animals. Old animals are prone to fractures of bones and\r\ndegenerative changes of the body tissues. As a general rule, the young are\r\nmore subject to acute diseases and the old to chronic diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Insanitary yards.]\r\n\r\n_The surroundings or environments_ are important predisposing factors. A\r\ndark, crowded, poorly ventilated stable lowers the animal's vitality, and\r\nrenders it more susceptible to the disease. A few rods difference in the\r\nlocation of stables and yards may make a marked difference in the health of\r\nthe herd. A dry, protected site is always preferable to one in the open or\r\non low, poorly drained soil. The majority of domestic animals need but\r\nlittle shelter, but they do need dry, comfortable quarters during wet, cold\r\nweather.\r\n\r\n_Faulty feed and faulty methods of feeding_ are very common causes of\r\ndiseases of the digestive tract and the nervous system. A change from dry\r\nfeed to a green, succulent ration is a common cause of acute indigestion in\r\nboth horses and cattle. The feeding of a heavy ration of grain to horses\r\nthat are accustomed to exercise, during enforced rest may cause liver and\r\nkidney disorders. The feeding of spoiled, decomposed feeds may cause\r\nserious nervous and intestinal disorders.\r\n\r\n_One attack of a certain disease_ may influence the development of\r\nsubsequent attacks of the same, or a different disease. An individual may\r\nsuffer from an attack of pneumonia that so weakens the disease-resisting\r\npowers of the lungs as to result in a tubercular infection of these organs.\r\nIn the horse, one attack of azoturia predisposes it to a second attack. One\r\nattack of an infectious disease usually confers immunity against that\r\nparticular disease. _Heredity_ does not play as important a part in the\r\ndevelopment of diseases in domestic animals as in the human race. A certain\r\nfamily may inherit a predisposition to disease through the faulty or\r\ninsufficient development of an organ or group of organs. The different\r\nspecies of animals are affected by diseases peculiar to that particular\r\nspecies. The horse is the only species that is affected with azoturia.\r\nGlanders affects solipeds, while black leg is a disease peculiar to cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. What is disease?\r\n\r\n2. How are diseases classified? Give an example of the different classes.\r\n\r\n3. What is a predisposing cause? Exciting cause?\r\n\r\n4. Name the different predisposing and exciting causes of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDIAGNOSIS AND SYMPTOMS OF DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of recognizing or diagnosing the seat and nature of the\r\nmorbid change occurring in an organ or group of organs cannot be\r\noverestimated. Laymen do not comprehend the difficulty or importance of\r\ncorrectly grouping the signs or symptoms of disease in such a way as to\r\nenable them to recognize the nature of the disease. In order to be able to\r\nunderstand the meaning of the many symptoms or signs of disease, we must\r\npossess knowledge of the structure and physiological functions of the\r\ndifferent organs of the body. We must be familiar with the animal when it\r\nis in good health in order to be able to recognize any deviation from the\r\nnormal due to disease, and we must learn from personal observation the\r\ndifferent symptoms that characterize the different diseases. Stockmen\r\nshould be able to tell when any of the animals in their care are sick as\r\nsoon as the first symptom of disease manifests itself, by changes in the\r\ngeneral appearance and behavior. But in order to ascertain the exact\r\ncondition a general and systematic examination is necessary. The examiner,\r\nwhether he be a layman or a veterinarian, must observe the animal\r\ncarefully, noting the behavior, appearance, surroundings, and general and\r\nlocal symptoms.\r\n\r\nBefore making a _general examination_ of the animal it is well, if the\r\nexaminer is not already acquainted with the history of the case (care, feed\r\nand surroundings), to learn as much about this from the attendant as is\r\npossible. Inquiry should be made as to the feeding, the conditions under\r\nwhich the animal has been kept, the length of time it has been sick, its\r\nactions, or any other information that may be of assistance in forming the\r\ndiagnosis and outlining the treatment.\r\n\r\nThe _general symptoms_ inform us regarding the condition of the different\r\ngroups of body organs. A careful study of this group of symptoms enables us\r\ncorrectly to diagnose disease and inform ourselves as to the progress of\r\nlong, severe affections. These symptoms occur in connection with the pulse,\r\nrespirations, body temperature, skin and coat, visible mucous membranes,\r\nsecretions and excretions, and behavior of the animal.\r\n\r\n_The local symptoms_ are confined to a definite part or organ. Swelling,\r\npain, tenderness and loss of function are common local symptoms. A _direct_\r\nsymptom may also be considered under this head because of its direct\r\nrelation to the seat of disease. It aids greatly in forming the diagnosis.\r\n\r\nOther terms used in describing symptoms of disease are _objective_, which\r\nincludes all that can be recognized by the person making the examination;\r\n_indirect_, which are observed at a distance from the seat of the disease;\r\nand _premonitory_, which precede the direct, or characteristic symptoms.\r\nThe _subjective_ symptoms include such as are felt and described by the\r\npatient. These symptoms are available from the human patient only.\r\n\r\nPulse.--The character of the intermittent expansion of the arteries, called\r\nthe pulse, informs us as to the condition of the heart and blood-vessels.\r\nThe frequency of the pulse beat varies in the different species of animals.\r\nThe smaller the animal the more frequent the pulse. In young animals the\r\nnumber of beats per minute is greater than in adults. Excitement or fear,\r\nespecially if the animal possesses a nervous temperament, increases the\r\nfrequency of the pulse. During, and for a short time after, feeding and\r\nexercise, the pulse rate is higher than when the animal is standing at\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the normal rate of the pulse beats per minute:\r\n\r\nHorse  36 to  40 per minute\r\nOx     45 to  50 per minute\r\nSheep  70 to  80 per minute\r\nPig    70 to  80 per minute\r\nDog    90 to 100 per minute\r\n\r\nIn sickness the pulse is instantly responsive. It is of the greatest aid\r\nin diagnosing and in noting the progress of the disease. The following\r\nvarieties of pulse may be mentioned: _frequent, infrequent, quick, slow,\r\nlarge, small, hard, soft_ and _intermittent_. The terms frequent and\r\ninfrequent refer to the number of pulse beats in a given time; quick and\r\nslow to the length of time required for the pulse wave to pass beneath the\r\nfinger; large and small to the volume of the wave; hard and soft to its\r\ncompressibility; and intermittent to the occasional missing of a beat. A\r\npulse beat that is small and quick, or large and soft, is frequently met\r\nwith in diseases of a serious character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--The X on the lower border of the jaw indicates the\r\nplace where the pulse is taken.]\r\n\r\n_The horse's pulse_ is taken from the submaxillary artery at a point\r\nanterior to, or below the angle of the jaw and along its inferior border\r\n(Fig. 3). It is here that the artery winds around the inferior border of\r\nthe jaw in an upward direction, and, because of its location immediately\r\nbeneath the skin, it can be readily located by pressing lightly over the\r\nregion with the fingers.\r\n\r\n_Cattle's pulse_ is taken from the same artery as in the horse. The artery\r\nis most superficial a little above the border of the jaw. It is more\r\ndifficult to find the pulse wave in cattle than it is in horses, because of\r\nthe larger amount of connective tissue just beneath the skin and the\r\nheavier muscles of the jaw. A very satisfactory pulse may be found in the\r\nsmall arteries located along the inferior part of the lateral region of the\r\ntail and near its base.\r\n\r\n_The sheep's pulse_ may be taken directly from the femoral artery by\r\nplacing the fingers over the inner region of the thigh. By pressing with\r\nthe hand over the region of the heart we may determine its condition.\r\n\r\n_The hog's pulse_ can easily be taken from the femoral artery on the\r\ninternal region of the thigh. The artery crosses this region obliquely and\r\nis quite superficial toward its anterior and lower portion.\r\n\r\n_The dog's_ pulse is usually taken from the brachial artery. The pulse wave\r\ncan be readily felt by resting the fingers over the inner region of the arm\r\nand just above the elbow. The character of the heart beats in dogs may be\r\ndetermined by resting the hand on the chest wall.\r\n\r\nRESPIRATION.--The frequency of the respirations varies with the species.\r\nThe following table gives the frequency of the respirations in domestic\r\nanimals:\r\n\r\nHorse    8 to 10 per minute\r\nOx      12 to 15 per minute\r\nSheep   12 to 20 per minute\r\nDog     15 to 20 per minute\r\nPig     10 to 15 per minute\r\n\r\nThe ratio of the heart beats to the respirations is about 1:4 or 1:5. This\r\nratio is not constant in ruminants. Rumination, muscular exertion and\r\nexcitement increase the frequency and cause the respirations to become\r\nirregular. In disease the ratio between the heart beats and respirations\r\nis greatly disturbed, and the character of the respiratory sounds and\r\nmovements may be greatly changed (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Auscultation of the lungs can be practised to an\r\nadvantage over the outlined portion of the chest wall, only.]\r\n\r\nSevere exercise and diseased conditions of the lungs cause the animal to\r\nbreathe rapidly and bring into use all of the respiratory muscles. Such\r\nforced or labored breathing is a common symptom in serious lung diseases,\r\n\"bloat\" in cattle, or any condition that may cause dyspnoea. Horses\r\naffected with \"heaves\" show a double contraction of the muscles in the\r\nregion of the flank during expiration. In spasm of the diaphragm or\r\n\"thumps\" the expiration appears to be a short, jerking movement of the\r\nflank. In the abdominal form of respiration the movements of the walls of\r\nthe chest are limited. This occurs in pleurisy. In the thoracic form of\r\nrespiration the abdominal wall is held rigid and the movement of the chest\r\nwalls make up for the deficiency. This latter condition occurs in\r\nperitonitis.\r\n\r\n_A cough_ is caused by irritation of the membrane lining the air passages.\r\nThe character of the cough may vary according to the nature of the disease.\r\nWe may speak of a moist cough when the secretions in the air passages are\r\nmore or less abundant. A dry cough occurs when the lining membrane of the\r\nair passages is dry and inflamed. This may occur in the early stage of the\r\ninflammation, or as a result of irritation from dust or irritating gases.\r\nChronic cough occurs when the disease is of long duration or chronic. In\r\npleurisy the cough may be short and painful, and in broken wind, deep and\r\nsuppressed. In parasitic diseases of the air passages and lungs, the\r\nparoxysm of coughing may be severe and \"husky\" in character.\r\n\r\nThe odor of the expired air, the character of the discharge and the\r\nrespiratory sounds found on making a careful examination are important aids\r\nin arriving at a correct diagnosis, and in studying the progress of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Fever thermometer.]\r\n\r\nBody Temperature.--The body temperature of an animal is taken by inserting\r\nthe fever thermometer into the rectum. In large animals a five-inch, and in\r\nsmall animals a four-inch fever thermometer is used. It should be inserted\r\nfull length and left in position from one and one-half to three minutes,\r\ndepending on the rapidity with which it registers (Fig. 5).\r\n\r\nThe average normal body temperatures of domestic animals are as follows:\r\n\r\nHorses  100.5\\260 F.\r\nCattle  101.4\\260 F.\r\nSheep   104.0\\260 F.\r\nSwine   103.0\\260 F.\r\nDog     101.4\\260 F.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide variation in the body temperatures of domestic\r\nanimals. This is especially true of cattle, sheep and hogs. In order to\r\ndetermine the normal temperature of an animal, it may be necessary to take\r\ntwo or more readings at different times, and compare them with the body\r\ntemperatures of other animals in the herd that are known to be healthy.\r\n\r\nExercise, feeding, rumination, excitement, warm, close stables, exposure to\r\ncold and drinking ice cold water are common causes of variations in the\r\nbody temperatures of domestic animals.\r\n\r\nVisible Mucous Membranes.--The visible mucous membranes, as they are\r\ntermed, are the lining membranes of the eyelids, nostrils and nasal\r\ncavities, and mouth. In health they are usually a pale red, excepting when\r\nthe animal is exercised or excited, when they appear a brighter red and\r\nsomewhat vascular. In disease the following changes in color and appearance\r\nmay be noted: When inflamed, as in cold in the head, a deep red; in\r\nimpoverished or bloodless conditions of the body and in internal\r\nhaemorrhage, pale; in diseases of the liver, sometimes yellowish, or dark\r\nred; in diseases of the digestive tract (buccal mucous membrane), coated;\r\nif inflamed, dry at first, later excessively moist; and in certain germ\r\ndiseases a mottled red, or showing nodules, ulcers and scars.\r\n\r\nSurface of the Body.--When a horse is in a good condition and well cared\r\nfor, the coat is short, fine, glossy and smooth and the skin pliable and\r\nelastic. Healthy cattle have a smooth, glossy coat and the skin feels\r\nmellow and elastic. The fleece of sheep should appear smooth and have\r\nplenty of yolk, the skin pliable and light pink in color. When the coat\r\nloses its lustre and gloss and the skin becomes hard, rigid, thickened and\r\ndirty, it indicates a lack of nutrition and an unhealthy condition of the\r\nbody. In sheep, during sickness, the wool may become dry and brittle and\r\nthe skin pale and rigid. When affected with external parasites, the hair or\r\nwool becomes dirty and rough, a part of the skin may be denuded of hair,\r\nand it appears thickened, leathery and scabby, or shows pimples, vesicles\r\nand sores.\r\n\r\nDuring fever, the temperature of the surface of the body is very unequal.\r\nIn serious diseases or diseases that are about to terminate fatally, the\r\nskin feels cold and the hair is wet with sweat.\r\n\r\nWhen animals are allowed to \"rough it\" during the cold weather, the coat of\r\nhair becomes heavy and rough. This is a provision of nature and enables\r\nthem, as long as the coat is dry, to withstand severe cold.\r\n\r\nHorses that are in a low physical condition, or when accustomed to hard\r\nwork, if then kept in a stall for a few days without exercise, commonly\r\nshow a filling of the cannon regions of the posterior extremities. This\r\ncondition also commonly occurs in disease and in mares that have reached\r\nthe latter period of pregnancy. Sheep that are unthrifty and in a poor\r\nphysical condition, especially if this is due to internal parasites,\r\nfrequently develop dropsical swellings in the region of the jaw, or neck.\r\n\r\nBody Excretions.--The character of the body excretions, faeces and urine\r\nmay become greatly changed in certain diseases. It is important that the\r\nstockman or veterinarian observe these changes, and in certain diseases\r\nmake an analysis of the urine. This may be necessary in order properly to\r\ndiagnose the case.\r\n\r\nBehavior of the Animal.--When the body temperature is high, the animal may\r\nappear greatly depressed. If suffering severe pain, it may be restless. In\r\ndiseases of the nervous system, the behavior of the animal may be greatly\r\nchanged. Spasms, convulsions, general local paralysis, stupid condition and\r\nunconsciousness may occur as symptoms of this class of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

A knowledge of\r\nfeeds, methods of feeding, care, sanitation and the use of such biological\r\nproducts as bacterins, vaccines and protective serums is of the greatest\r\nimportance to the farmer and veterinarian. We are beginning to realize that\r\none of the most important secrets of profitable and successful stock\r\nraising is the prevention of disease; that the agricultural colleges are\r\ndoing a great work in helping to teach farmers that there are right and\r\nwrong methods of feeding and caring for animals; that the practice of\r\nsanitation in caring for animals is the cheapest method of treating\r\ndisease; and that it is advisable to practise radical methods of control,\r\nwhen necessary, in order to rid the herd of an infectious disease.\r\n\r\n_The ration fed_ and the method of feeding are not only important in\r\nconsidering the causes of diseases of the digestive tract, but diseases of\r\nother organs as well. The feeding of an excessive, or insufficient quantity\r\nof feed, or a ration that is too concentrated, bulky and innutritious, poor\r\nin quality, or spoiled may produce disease.\r\n\r\n_An impure water supply_ is a common cause of disease. A deep well that is\r\nclosed in properly and does not permit of contamination from filth, does\r\nnot insure a clean water supply if the trough or tank is not kept clean.\r\n\r\n_Farm Buildings_.--If stockmen would make a more careful study of the kind\r\nof farm buildings most suitable to their needs, the selection of the\r\nlocation, the proportions, the arrangement of the interior and the lighting\r\nand ventilation, there would be a great saving in losses from disease, and\r\nthe cost of building in many cases would be lessened. Your neighbor's\r\nbuilding that you have taken for your model may not be suitable for your\r\nneeds. It may be more expensive than your financial condition permits. It\r\nmay be poorly lighted and ventilated and not suited to the site that you\r\nhave selected.\r\n\r\n_Biological Products_.--There are a number of biological products that may\r\nbe used in the prevention and control of disease. Some of these products,\r\nsuch as tuberculin and malein, enable the owner to rid his herds of\r\ntubercular cows and glandered horses before these diseases have become far\r\nenough advanced to be recognized by the visible symptoms alone. Black leg,\r\nanthrax and hog-cholera vaccines are valuable agents in the control of\r\ndisease. In the treatment of fistula and infectious abortion, bacterins may\r\nbe used. There are many other germ diseases and infections for which\r\nvaccines and bacterins may be used. However, we must not depend wholly on\r\nthese agents in the control of disease. We must possess a knowledge of the\r\nmanner in which the infection is spread, for without this knowledge we\r\nwould be unable to prevent its dissemination over a wide area.\r\n\r\nMedicinal Treatment.--The average stockman or veterinarian is more familiar\r\nwith the treatment of disease with drugs than he is with the preventive\r\nmeasures just described. This statement does not imply that a knowledge of\r\nmedicinal therapeutics is not of the greatest importance in the treatment\r\nof disease. The ultimate object of all drugs is both to prevent and cure\r\ndisease, but the injudicious use of a drug does neither. A discussion of\r\nthis subject cannot be entered into here, and because of its largeness it\r\nis not advisable to discuss it further than a brief summary of the methods\r\nof administering drugs.\r\n\r\nAdministration of Drugs.--Drugs may be administered by the following\r\nchannels: by way of the mouth, in the feed or as a drench; by injecting\r\ninto the tissues beneath the skin or hypodermically; by rubbing into the\r\nskin; by the air passages and the lungs; and by injecting into the rectum.\r\n\r\nIf the animal is not too sick to eat and the drug does not possess an\r\nunpleasant taste, it may be given with the feed. If soluble, it may be\r\ngiven with the drinking water, or in any case, it may be mixed with ground\r\nfeed if this method is to be preferred. In all cases the medicine must be\r\nwell mixed with the feed. This is especially important if there are a\r\nnumber of animals to be treated, as there is more certainty of each animal\r\ngetting the proper dose and the danger of overdosing is avoided. If the\r\nyoung animal is nursing the mother, we can take advantage of certain drugs\r\nbeing eliminated in the mother's milk and administer the drug to the\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--A good kind of a dose syringe.]\r\n\r\nDRENCHES.--In the larger animals a bulky drench is sometimes difficult to\r\nadminister, and we should, in all cases, count on a portion being wasted.\r\n\r\n_Horses_ are sometimes difficult to drench, and it may be advisable to\r\nconfine the horse in some way. Small drenches can readily be given with a\r\nsyringe (Fig. 6) or a small bottle. In giving bulky drenches it is most\r\nconvenient to use a long-necked, heavy glass bottle. The horse should be\r\nbacked into a narrow stall and the head elevated by placing a loop in the\r\nend of a small rope over the upper jaw, passing the rope back of the nose\r\npiece on the halter and throwing it over a beam, and raising the head until\r\nthe mouth is slightly higher than the throat. If the horse refuses to\r\nswallow, a tablespoonful of clean water may be dropped into the nostril.\r\nThis forces it to swallow. A drench should never be given through the nose,\r\nas it may pass into the air passages and cause a fatal inflammation of the\r\nlungs.\r\n\r\n_Cattle_ can be easily drenched by taking hold of the nostrils with the\r\nfingers, or snapping a bull ring into the partition between the nostrils\r\nand elevating the head.\r\n\r\n_Sheep_ may be drenched either in the standing position, or when thrown on\r\nthe haunches and held between the knees. Care should be exercised in giving\r\nirritating drenches to sheep, especially if the drench be bulky.\r\n\r\n_A herd of hogs_ may be quickly and easily drenched if they are confined in\r\na small pen, and the loop of a small rope placed around the snout, well\r\nback toward the corners of the mouth. A small metal dose syringe should be\r\nused. If the drench is bulky and the hog difficult to hold, it may be\r\nnecessary to elevate the head and raise the forefeet from the ground. The\r\ndrench should not be given until the hog is quiet and well under control,\r\nas there is some danger of the medicine passing into the air passages and\r\ndoing harm. It may be necessary to mark the hogs that have been drenched\r\nwith a daub of paint, or in some other manner in order to be able to\r\ndistinguish them from the untreated animals.\r\n\r\nThe administration of drugs enclosed in a gelatin capsule, or mixing them\r\nwith syrup, honey or linseed oil, and rolling the mass into the form of a\r\ncylinder is commonly practised. The _capsule_ or _ball_ may then be shot\r\ninto the pharynx with a balling gun. A ball may also be given to the larger\r\nanimals by carrying it into the back part of the mouth with the hand, and\r\nplacing it on the back part of the tongue. In the horse this method of\r\nadministration requires some practice. The tongue must be pulled well\r\nforward, the head held up, and the tongue released as soon as the ball is\r\nplaced on the tongue, so that it may pass back into the pharynx.\r\n\r\nThe administration of drugs by _injecting beneath the skin_ (Fig. 7) is\r\nsuitable when the drug is non-irritating and the dose is small. Drugs\r\nadministered in this way act promptly and energetically. The alkaloid or\r\nactive principle of the drug is commonly used. A fold of the skin is picked\r\nup with the fingers and the needle is quickly introduced, care being taken\r\nnot to prick or scratch the muscular tissue, as this causes some pain and\r\nmakes the animal restless. In order to avoid abscess formation at the point\r\nof injection, the skin should be cleansed with a disinfectant and the\r\nsyringe and needle sterilized before using.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Hypodermic syringes.]\r\n\r\nDrugs are not absorbed through the unbroken skin, but when applied with\r\nfriction, or when the outer layer is removed by blistering, absorption may\r\ntake place. Liniments, blisters and _poultices_ are the preparations used.\r\n\r\n_Volatile drugs_, such as chloroform and ether, are absorbed quickly by the\r\nenormous vascular surface of the lungs. This class of drugs is administered\r\nfor the purpose of producing general anaesthesia. _Anaesthetics_ are\r\nindispensable in many surgical operations.\r\n\r\nThe administration of a drug in the form of _medicated steam_ is quite\r\nuseful in combating some respiratory diseases. In steaming large animals a\r\npail about half full of boiling-hot water to which has been added about an\r\nounce of coal-tar disinfectant, or whatever drug is required, is held\r\nwithin about one foot of the animal's nostrils. It is usually advisable to\r\nthrow a light cover over the head and pail in order to direct the steam\r\ntoward the nostrils. Dogs can be placed on a cane-seated chair and a pail\r\nor pan of boiling-hot water placed under it, and a sheet thrown over all.\r\n\r\nDrugs are administered by way of the rectum when the animal can not be\r\ndrenched, or the drug can not be given in any other way and when a local\r\naction is desired. An _enema_ or _clyster_ is a fluid injection into the\r\nrectum and is employed for the following purposes: to accelerate the action\r\nof a purgative; to stimulate the peristaltic movement of the intestines; to\r\nkill intestinal parasites; to reduce body temperature; to administer\r\nmedicine; and to supply the animal with food. An enema may be administered\r\nby allowing water to gravitate into the rectum from a height of two or\r\nthree feet or by using an injection pump. In the larger animals several\r\nfeet of heavy walled rubber tubing carrying a straight nozzle at one end\r\nshould be used. In administering an enema, the rectum should be emptied out\r\nwith the hand and the nozzle of the syringe carried as far forward as\r\npossible. The operator should be careful not to irritate or tear the wall\r\nof the rectum.\r\n\r\nSize of the Dose.--The doses recommended in the treatment of the different\r\ndiseases, unless otherwise stated, are for mature animals. The dose for a\r\ncolt one year of age is about one-third the quantity given the adult, two\r\nyears of age one-half, and three years of age two-thirds. In well-matured\r\ncolts a larger dose may be given. In cattle, the doses recommended are\r\nabout the same. In the smaller animals the size of the dose may be based on\r\nthe development and age of the animal. When the drug is administered at\r\nshort intervals or repeated, the size of the dose should be reduced. The\r\nphysiological action of some drugs may be changed by varying the size of\r\nthe dose.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Give a general description of preventive treatment.\r\n\r\n2.

The development of these organs differs in the\r\ndifferent species of animals. For example, solipeds possess a small, simple\r\nstomach and capacious, complicated intestines. Just the opposite is true of\r\nruminants. The different species of ruminants possess a large, complicated\r\nstomach, and comparatively simple intestines. In swine we meet with a more\r\nhighly developed stomach than that of solipeds and a more simple intestinal\r\ntract. Of all domestic animals the most simple digestive tract occurs in\r\nthe dog. These variations in the development of the different organs of\r\ndigestion, together with the difference in the character of the feed and\r\nmethod of feeding, cause a variation in the kind of diseases met with in\r\nthe different species. The complicated stomach of ruminants predispose them\r\nto diseases of this portion of the digestive tract. Because of their\r\ncomplicated intestinal tract solipeds are prone to intestinal disease.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE MOUTH\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION.--The mouth is the first division of the digestive\r\ntract. It is formed by the lips, cheeks, palate, soft palate, tongue and\r\nteeth. Here the feed is acted on mechanically. It is broken up by the teeth\r\nand moved about until mixed with the saliva and put into condition to pass\r\nthrough the pharynx and along the oesophagus to the stomach. The mechanical\r\nchange that the feed is subject to is very imperfect in dogs. In the horse\r\nit is a slow, thorough process, although greedy feeders are not uncommon.\r\nThe first mastication in the ox is three times quicker than in horses, but\r\nthe process of rumination is slow and thorough.\r\n\r\nSTOMATITIS.--Simple inflammation of the mouth is frequently met with in\r\nhorses. Ulcerative or infectious inflammation commonly occurs in young, and\r\noccasionally in old, debilitated animals. This form of sore mouth will be\r\ndiscussed along with other infectious diseases, and the following\r\ndiscussion will be confined to the non-infectious form of the disease.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ are irritation from the bit, sharp teeth, irritating drenches,\r\nroughage that contains beards or awns of grasses and grains, and burrs that\r\nwound the lining membrane of the mouth. Febrile, or digestive disorders, or\r\nany condition that may interfere with feeding, may cause this disorder. In\r\nthe latter cases the mucous membrane of the mouth is not cleansed by the\r\nsaliva. Particles of feed may decompose and irritating organisms set up an\r\ninflammation. Putrid or decomposed slops, hot feeds, irritating drenches\r\nand drinking from filthy wallows are common causes of inflammation of the\r\nmouth in hogs.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ vary in the different cases and species. Slight or localized\r\ninflammation of the mouth is usually overlooked by the attendant. Lampas of\r\nhorses may be considered a local inflammation involving the palate.\r\nLacerations of the cheek or tongue by the teeth, or irritating feed,\r\nusually result in a slight interference with prehension and mastication and\r\nmore or less salivation. Salivation from this cause should not be confused\r\nwith salivation resulting from feeding on white clover.\r\n\r\nIn generalized inflammation of the mucous membrane, the first symptom\r\nusually noticed is the inability to eat. On examining the mouth we find the\r\nmucous membrane inflamed, hot and dry. A part may appear coated. In a short\r\ntime the odor from the mouth is fetid. Following this dry stage of the\r\ninflammation is the period of salivation. Saliva dribbles from the mouth,\r\nand in severe cases it is mixed with white, stringy shreds of epithelium\r\nand tinged with blood. In less acute forms of the disease, we may notice\r\nlittle blisters or vesicles scattered over the lining membrane of the lips,\r\ncheeks and tongue.\r\n\r\nThe acute form of stomatitis runs a short course, usually a few days, and\r\nresponds readily to treatment. Localized inflammation caused by irritation\r\nfrom teeth, or feeding irritating feeds, does not respond so readily to\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is largely preventive and consists largely in removing the\r\ncause. When the mouth is inflamed, roughage should be fed rather sparingly,\r\nand soft feeds such as slops, mashes, or gruels given in place of the\r\nregular diet. Plenty of clean drinking water should be provided. In the way\r\nof medicinal treatment antiseptic and astringent washes are indicated. A\r\nfour per cent water solution of boric acid may be used, or a one-half per\r\ncent water solution of a high grade coal-tar disinfectant. The mouth should\r\nbe thoroughly irrigated twice daily until the mucous surfaces appear\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nDEPRAVED APPETITE\r\n\r\nA depraved appetite is met with in all species of farm animals, but it is\r\nespecially common in ruminants. It should not be classed as a disease, but\r\nmore correctly as a bad habit, or symptom of innutrition or indigestion.\r\nThe animals affected seem to have an irresistible desire to lick, chew and\r\nswallow indigestible and disgusting objects.\r\n\r\n_The common cause_ of depraved appetite is the feeding of a ration\r\ndeficient in certain food elements. A ration deficient in protein or in\r\nsalts is said to cause this disorder. Lack of exercise, or confinement,\r\ninnutrition, and a depraved sense of taste may favor the development of\r\nthis disease. For example, when sheep are housed closely they may contract\r\nthe habit of chewing one another's fleeces. Lambs are especially apt to\r\ncontract this habit when suckling ewes that have on their udders long wool\r\nsoiled with urine and faeces.\r\n\r\n_The first symptom_ is the desire to chew, lick or eat indigestible or\r\nfilthy substances. Horses and cattle may stand and lick a board for an hour\r\nor more; cattle may chew the long hair from the tails of horses; sheep may\r\nnibble wool; sows may within a short time after giving birth to their pigs,\r\nkill and eat them; chickens may pick and eat feathers. Innutrition may\r\naccompany the abnormal appetite, as very frequently the affected animal\r\nshows a disposition to leave its feed in order to eat these injurious and\r\ninnutritions substances. In ruminants, the wool or hair may form balls and\r\nobstruct the opening into the third compartment, causing chronic\r\nindigestion and death.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in the removal of the cause. Feeding a ration that\r\nmeets the needs of the system, clean quarters and plenty of exercise are\r\nthe most important preventive lines of treatment. In such cases medicinal\r\ntreatment (saline and bitter tonics) may be indicated. It is usually\r\nadvisable to remove the affected animals from the herd or flock in order to\r\nprevent others from imitating them.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE STOMACH\r\n\r\nThere is a remarkable difference in the development of the stomachs of\r\nsolipeds and ruminants.\r\n\r\nThe horse's stomach (Fig. 8) is simple and has a capacity of three or four\r\ngallons. The left portion is lined with a cuticular mucous membrane, and\r\nthe right portion with a glandular mucous membrane that has in it the\r\nglands that secrete the gastric juice. The most important digestive change\r\nin the feed is the action of the gastric juice on the proteids and their\r\nconversion into the simpler products, proteoses and peptones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Photograph of model of horse's stomach: left\r\nportion, oesophagus, right portion, and intestine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Photograph of model of stomach of ruminant: rumen,\r\nreticulum, omasum, and abomasum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--A section of the wall of the rumen and reticulum,\r\nshowing the oesophageal groove: lips of groove; opening from\r\noesophagus; and opening into omasum.]\r\n\r\nRUMINANTS have a compound stomach (Figs. 9 and 10). The capacity of the\r\nstomach of the ox is between twenty and thirty gallons. The four\r\ncompartments into which it is divided are the rumen, reticulum, omasum, and\r\nabomasum or true stomach. The rumen is the largest compartment, with a\r\ncapacity of more than twenty gallons. The reticulum is the smallest, with a\r\ncapacity of about one-half gallon.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief mastication, the food passes directly to the _rumen_. Here it\r\nis subjected to a churning movement that mixes and presses the contents of\r\nthe rumen forward in the direction of the oesophageal opening, where it is\r\nready for regurgitation. It is then carried back to the mouth, remasticated\r\nand returned to the rumen. This is termed rumination. All food material\r\nthat is sufficiently broken up is directed toward the opening into the\r\nthird compartment by the oesophageal grove (Fig. 10), a demi-canal that\r\nconnects this with the oesophageal opening.\r\n\r\nThe third compartment, the _omasum_, communicates anteriorly with the\r\nsecond and first, and posteriorly with the fourth compartment or true\r\nstomach. The interior arrangement of this compartment is most singular. It\r\nis divided by a number of large folds of the lining membrane between which\r\nare smaller folds. It is between these folds that the contents pass.\r\n\r\nThe first three compartments possess no glands capable of secreting a\r\ndigestive juice. However, important digestive changes occur. The\r\ncarbohydrates are digested by means of enzymes contained in the feed. The\r\nmost important function of the rumen and omasum is the maceration of the\r\nfibrous substances, and the digestion of the cellulose. Between sixty and\r\nseventy per cent of the cellulose is digested in the rumen.\r\n\r\n_The abomasum_ is lined by a gastric mucous membrane. The gastric juice\r\nsecreted converts the protein into peptones. In the young a milk curdling\r\nferment is also secreted by the glands of this compartment.\r\n\r\nTHE STOMACH OF THE HOG is a type between the carnivora and ruminant. The\r\ndigestive changes may be divided into four stages. The first period is one\r\nof starch conversion; the second period is the same, only more pronounced;\r\nthe third period, both starch and protein conversion occurs; and the fourth\r\nperiod is taken up mostly with protein digestion.\r\n\r\nACUTE INDIGESTION OF THE STOMACH OF SOLIPEDS.--Diseases of the stomach are\r\nless common in solipeds than in ruminants. The simple stomach of the horse\r\nand the comparatively unimportant place that it occupies in the digestion\r\nof the feed renders it less subject to disease. Only under the most\r\nunfavorable conditions for digestion of the feed does this class of\r\ndisorders occur. Acute indigestion in the form of overloading and\r\nfermentation occurs in the stomach (Fig. 11).\r\n\r\n_The predisposing causes_ that have to do with the development of these\r\ndisorders, are the small capacity of the stomach and the location and\r\nsmallness of the openings leading from the oesophagus and into the small\r\nintestines. Greedy eaters are more prone to indigestion than animals that\r\neat slowly and are fed intelligently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Dilated stomach of horse.]\r\n\r\n_The following exciting causes_ may be mentioned: Sudden changes in ration;\r\nfeeding too much green feed or grain; feeding frozen or decomposed feeds;\r\ndrinking ice-cold water; and violent exercise or work that the animal is\r\nnot accustomed to, immediately after feeding are the common\r\ndisease-producing factors.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ may vary from impaired appetite and slight restlessness to\r\nviolent, colicky pains. In the large majority of cases the attendant is\r\nunable to differentiate between this and other forms of acute indigestion.\r\nThe characteristic symptoms are attempts at regurgitation and vomiting,\r\nassuming a dog-sitting position and finally such nervous symptoms as\r\nchamping of the jaws, staggering movement and extreme dulness.\r\n\r\nThe violent form of gastric indigestion frequently ends in death. Rupture\r\nof the stomach is not an uncommon complication (Fig. 12).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Rupture of stomach of horse.]\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both preventive and medicinal. This digestive disorder\r\ncan be prevented. The feeding of the right kind of a ration and in the\r\nright way, and avoiding conditions that may interfere with the digestion of\r\nthe feed, are the general lines of preventive treatment indicated. Such\r\nmeasures are of special importance in the handling of animals that possess\r\nan individual predisposition toward this class of disease. In mild attacks\r\nthe animal should be subjected to a rigid or careful diet during the attack\r\nand for a few days later.\r\n\r\nIt is advisable to place the animal in a comfortable stall that is well\r\nbedded with straw and plenty large for it to move about in. If a roomy\r\nsick-stall can not be provided, a grass lot or barn floor may be used. If\r\nthe weather is chilly or cold, the body should be covered with a blanket\r\nand roller bandages applied to the limbs.\r\n\r\nBulky drenches should not be given. Stimulants and drugs capable of\r\nretarding fermentation are indicated. Sometimes the administration of a\r\nsedative is indicated. Treatment should be prompt, as in many cases\r\nfermentation of the contents of the stomach occurs and gases form rapidly.\r\nFrom two to four ounces of oil of turpentine may be given in from six to\r\neight ounces of linseed oil.\r\n\r\nACUTE INDIGESTION OF THE STOMACH OF RUMINANTS.--The different forms of\r\nacute indigestion are bloating, overloading of the rumen and impaction of\r\nthe omasum.\r\n\r\nTYMPANITES, \"BLOATING.\"--This disorder is usually caused by animals feeding\r\non green feeds, such as clover, alfalfa and green corn, that ferment\r\nreadily. Stormy, rainy weather seems to favor bloating. The consumption of\r\nspoiled feeds such as potatoes and beets may cause it. The drinking of a\r\nlarge quantity of water, especially if cold, chills the wall of the rumen\r\nand interferes with its movement. Frozen feeds may act in the same way.\r\nSudden changes in the feed, inflammation of the rumen, and a weak\r\nperistaltic movement of the paunch resulting from disease or insufficient\r\nnourishment are frequent causes. It may occur in chronic disease. In\r\ntuberculosis, bloating sometimes occurs.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are as follows: The paunch or rumen occupies the left side\r\nof the abdominal cavity, hence the distention of the abdominal wall by the\r\ncollecting of gas in the rumen occurs principally on that side. The gas\r\nforms quickly and the distended wall is highly elastic and resonant. The\r\nanimal stops eating and ruminating, the back may be arched and the ears\r\ndroop. In the more severe cases the wall of the abdomen is distended on\r\nboth sides, the respirations are quickened and labored, the pulse small and\r\nquick, the eyes are prominent and the mucous membrane congested. Death\r\nresults from asphyxia brought on by the distended paunch pushing forward\r\nand interfering with the movement of the lungs and the absorption of the\r\npoisonous gases.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both preventive and medicinal. This form of acute\r\nindigestion can be largely prevented by practising the following preventive\r\nmeasures: All changes in the feed should be made gradually, especially if\r\nthe ration fed is heavy, or the new ration consists largely of green,\r\nsucculent feed. Cattle pasturing on clover should be kept under close\r\nobservation. It is not advisable to pasture cattle on rank growths of\r\nclover that are wet with dew or a light rain. Bloating can be quickly\r\nrelieved by puncturing the wall of the paunch with the trocar and cannula.\r\nThe operation is quite simple and is not followed by bad results. The\r\ninstrument is plunged through the walls of the abdomen and rumen in the\r\nmost prominent portion of the flank, midway between the border of the last\r\nrib and the point of the haunch (Fig. 13). The trocar is then withdrawn\r\nfrom the cannula. After the gas has escaped through the cannula, the trocar\r\nis replaced and the instrument withdrawn. After using the trocar and\r\ncannula, the instrument should be cleaned by placing it in boiling hot\r\nwater. It is advisable to wash the skin at the seat of the operation with a\r\ndisinfectant before operating. In chronic tympanitis, it is sometimes\r\nadvisable to leave the cannula in position by tying a tape to the flange,\r\npassing it around the body and tying.\r\n\r\nAs a cathartic for cattle, we may give one quart of linseed and from two to\r\nfour ounces of turpentine, or one to two pounds of Epsom or Glauber's\r\nsalts, dissolved in plenty of water. Sheep may be given about one-fourth\r\nthe dose recommended for cattle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--The X indicates the point where the wall of flank\r\nand rumen are punctured with trocar and cannula in \"bloat.\"]\r\n\r\nOVERLOADING THE RUMEN.--This form of indigestion occurs when ruminants have\r\naccess to feeds that they are not accustomed to. As a result, they eat\r\ngreedily and the mass of feed in the rumen becomes so heavy that the walls\r\nof the organ can not move it about, and digestion is interfered with. This\r\nis especially true of succulent feeds. A diseased condition of the animal\r\npredisposes it to this disorder. If after eating an excessive amount of\r\ndry, innutritions fodder, the animal drinks freely of cold water, acute\r\nsymptoms of overloading are manifested.\r\n\r\n_The general symptoms_ occurring in overloading resembles those seen in\r\nbloating. The symptoms may be mild and extend over a period of several\r\ndays, or it may take on a highly acute form, terminating fatally within a\r\nfew hours. The acuteness of the attack depends on the character and\r\nquantity of feed eaten. If a large quantity of green feed is eaten,\r\nfermentation occurs and the animal may die within a few hours. The swelling\r\non the left side has a doughy feel. It is not as elastic and resonant as in\r\nbloat, even when complicated by some gas formation. The animal may stop\r\nruminating, refuse to eat, and act dull. In the more severe cases the\r\nrespirations are hurried and labored, the pulse small and quick and the\r\nexpression of the face indicates pain. Colicky pains sometimes occur. Death\r\nmay occur from shock or asphyxia.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. This disease can be\r\nprevented by using the necessary precautions to prevent animals from\r\novereating. If gas forms, the trocar and cannula should be used. A drench\r\nof from one to two pounds of Epsom or Glauber's salts should be given.\r\nSheep may be given from four to six ounces of Epsom or Glauber's salts. We\r\nshould endeavor to stimulate the movement of the paunch by pressure on the\r\nflank with the hand, throwing cold water on the wall of the abdomen and by\r\nhypodermic injections of strychnine. Rumenotomy should be performed when\r\nnecessary. This operation consists in opening the walls of the abdomen and\r\nrumen, and removing a part of the contents of the rumen. This is not a\r\ndangerous operation when properly performed, and should not be postponed\r\nuntil the animal is too weak to make a recovery.\r\n\r\nIMPACTION OF THE OMASUM.--This disease may occur as a complication of other\r\nforms of acute indigestion and diseases accompanied by an abnormal body\r\ntemperature. Feeds that are dry and innutritions commonly cause it. Other\r\ncauses are an excessive quantity of feed, sudden changes in the diet and\r\ndrinking an insufficient quantity of water.\r\n\r\nAs in other diseases of the stomach, the appetite is diminished, rumination\r\nceases or occurs at irregular intervals, and the animal is more or less\r\nfeverish. Bloating and constipation may occur. The animal may lose flesh,\r\nis weak, walks stiffly and grunts as though in pain when it moves about in\r\nthe stall and at each respiration. In the acute form, marked symptoms are\r\nsometimes manifested. At first the animal acts drowsy; later violent\r\nnervous symptoms may develop.\r\n\r\n_The course_ of this disease varies from a few days to several weeks. Death\r\nfrequently occurs. Frequently a diarrhoea accompanies recovery, a portion\r\nof the faeces appearing black with polished surfaces, as though they had\r\nbeen baked.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in practising the necessary precautions\r\nagainst the development of this disease by avoiding sudden changes in the\r\nfeed, the feeding of dry, innutritions feeds in too large amounts, allowing\r\nanimals plenty of water and providing them with salt. The best purgative to\r\ngive is Glauber's or Epsom salts in from one- to two-pound doses, dissolved\r\nin at least one gallon of water. This physic may be repeated in from twelve\r\nto eighteen hours if necessary. Two drachms of tincture of nux vomica and\r\none ounce of alcohol may be given in a drench three times daily. Hypodermic\r\ninjections of strychnine, eserine, or pilocarpine are useful in the\r\ntreatment of this disease. When recovery begins, the animal should be\r\nallowed moderate exercise and be fed food of a laxative nature.\r\n\r\nFOREIGN BODIES IN THE STOMACH OF RUMINANTS.--Foreign bodies such as hair\r\nballs and wire are very commonly found in the reticulum. This is because of\r\nthe habits of this class of animals. Cattle eat their feed hastily and do\r\nnot pick it over as carefully as does the horse.\r\n\r\nSmooth, round objects do no appreciable harm unless they block the opening\r\ninto the third compartment of the stomach. This frequently occurs in\r\nwool-eating lambs. Sharp-pointed objects may penetrate the surrounding\r\ntissues or such organs as the spleen, diaphragm, and pericardial sack. If\r\nthese organs are injured by the foreign body serious symptoms develop. The\r\n_general symptoms_ are pain, fever, weakness and marked emaciation. It is\r\nvery difficult to form a correct diagnosis, as the disease comes on without\r\nany apparent cause. Sometimes a swelling is noticed in the right and\r\ninferior abdominal region. If the heart becomes injured, symptoms of\r\npericarditis are manifested.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is largely preventive. Special care should be used to avoid\r\ngetting foreign substances into the feed given to cattle. The feed troughs\r\nshould be kept clean; we should avoid dropping nails and staples into the\r\nfeed when repairing the silo or grain bin; and pieces of baling wire should\r\nbe removed from straw or hay. Feeds known to be dirty should be run through\r\na fanning mill before feeding.\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE STOMACH OF SWINE.--Overloading and feeding spoiled feed\r\nare _common causes_ of inflammation of the stomach. Swill-fed hogs are most\r\ncommonly affected with this disorder. Overloading more often results in an\r\ninflammation of the stomach if the overloading follows the feeding of a\r\nlight ration, and the weather is extremely warm. Hogs that are accustomed\r\nto eating salt may eat too much of it when fed to them after it is withheld\r\nfor a week or longer, and a large quantity of water is taken soon\r\nafterwards. Slop containing alkaline washing powders and soaps irritate the\r\nstomach and intestines and cause a serious inflammation.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are loss of appetite, restlessness and sometimes colicky\r\npains. The hog usually wanders off by itself, acts dull, grunts, lies down\r\nin a quiet place or stands with the back arched and the abdomen held tense.\r\nVomiting commonly occurs. Sometimes the animal has a diarrhoea. The body\r\ntemperature may be above normal.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in avoiding irritating feeds and sudden changes in\r\nthe kind or quantity of feed fed. Drenching with hot water, or with about\r\none ounce of ipecacuan may be practised. From one to three ounces of castor\r\noil, depending on the size of the hog, may be given. After recovery the\r\nhogs should be confined in a comfortable pen and fed an easily digested\r\nration.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE INTESTINES\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION.--The intestinal tract of solipeds is the best developed\r\nof any of the domestic animals (Fig. 14). It is divided into two portions,\r\n_small_ and _large_. The _small intestine_ is a little over seventy feet in\r\nlength and about one and one-half inches in diameter. The mucous membrane\r\nlining presents a large absorbing surface and is well supplied with\r\nabsorbing vessels that take up the sugars, proteids and fats, which are\r\nfinally distributed to the body cells by the blood capillaries. In addition\r\nto these absorbing vessels the mucous membrane contains intestinal glands\r\nthat secrete the intestinal juice. Other digestive secretions from the\r\npancreatic gland and the liver are poured into the small intestine near its\r\norigin. These digestive juices act on the proteids, sugars, starches and\r\nfats, changing them into substances that are capable of being absorbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Photograph of model of digestive tract of horse:\r\noesophagus; stomach; liver; small intestine; large intestine; spleen.]\r\n\r\nAfter disengaging itself from the mass of loops lodged in the region of the\r\nleft flank, the small intestine crosses to the region of the right flank,\r\nwhere it terminates in the first division of the large intestine.\r\n\r\n_The large intestine_ is formed by the following divisions: caecum, double\r\ncolon, floating colon and rectum. The caecum is a large blind pouch that\r\nhas a capacity of about seven gallons. The double colon is the largest\r\ndivision of the intestines. It is about twelve feet in length and has a\r\ncapacity of about eighteen gallons. This portion of the intestine\r\nterminates in the region of the left flank in the floating colon. The\r\nlatter is about ten feet in length and about twice the diameter of the\r\nsmall intestine, from which it can readily be distinguished by its\r\nsacculated walls. The rectum is the terminal portion of the intestinal\r\ntract. It is about one and one-half feet in length and possesses heavy,\r\nelastic walls.\r\n\r\nFermentation and cellulose digestion occur in the caecum and double colon.\r\nIt is in the floating colon that the faeces are moulded into balls. The\r\nfaeces are retained in the rectum until defecation takes place.\r\n\r\nThe _intestinal tract of cattle_ is longer than that of solipeds and the\r\ndifferent divisions are not as well defined as in the horse's intestine and\r\nabout one-half its diameter. The large intestine is about thirty-five feet\r\nin length and its capacity six or seven gallons (Fig. 15).\r\n\r\nACUTE INTESTINAL INDIGESTION OF SOLIPEDS.--Acute indigestion is more common\r\nin horses and mules than it is in any of the other domestic animals.\r\nBecause of the difference in the causes and symptoms manifested, we may\r\ndivide it into the following forms: spasmodic, flatulent and obstruction\r\ncolic.\r\n\r\n_The predisposing causes_ are general and digestive debility resulting from\r\nthe feeding of an insufficient or unsuitable ration, and general and\r\nparasitic diseases of the intestine. Nervous, well-bred horses are most\r\nsusceptible to nervous or spasmodic colic.\r\n\r\n_The direct causes_ are improper methods of feeding and watering; giving\r\nthe animal severe or unusual exercise immediately before or after feeding;\r\nthe feeding of spoiled or green feeds and new grains; chilling of the body;\r\nimperfect mastication of feed because of defective teeth; obstruction of\r\nthe intestine by worms.\r\n\r\nThe feeding of grain at a time when the animal is not in fit condition to\r\ndigest it results in imperfect digestion in both the stomach and intestine.\r\nThis leads to irritation of the intestine and abnormal fermentation of its\r\ncontents. The drinking of a large quantity of water immediately after\r\nfeeding grain flushes at least a part of the undigested grain from the\r\nstomach through the small intestine and into the caecum. New grains, such\r\nas new oats, are hurried along the small intestine and reach the large\r\nintestine practically undigested. The two latter conditions are common\r\ncauses of _flatulent_ or _wind colic_. Sudden change in the ration,\r\nespecially to a green feed, may result in intestinal irritation and\r\nflatulence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Photograph of model of digestive tract of\r\nruminant: oesophagus; rumen; reticulum; omasum; abomasum; small intestine;\r\nand large intestine.]\r\n\r\nHorses that are greedy feeders and have sharp, uneven, smooth or diseased\r\nteeth are unable to masticate the feed properly. This results in\r\nunthriftiness caused by imperfect digestion and assimilation of the feed.\r\nSuch animals usually suffer from a catarrhal or chronic inflammation of the\r\nintestine, and may have periodic attacks of acute indigestion or colic.\r\n\r\n_Obstruction colic_ is very often caused by the feeding of too much\r\nroughage in the form of straw, shredded fodder, or hay. Debility often\r\ncontributes to this form of indigestion, and the double colon may become\r\nbadly impacted with alimentary matter.\r\n\r\nWorms may irritate the intestinal mucous membrane and interfere with\r\ndigestion, obstruct the intestine and cause debility and circulatory\r\ndisturbances. The large round worm may form a tangled mass and completely\r\nfill a portion of the double colon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--A yearling colt that died of aneurism colic.]\r\n\r\nSome species attach themselves to the intestinal wall, suck the blood of\r\nthe host and cause anaemia and debility. Colic resulting from _circulatory\r\ndisturbances_ is not common. The female of a certain species of\r\n_strongulus_ deposits eggs in the mucous membrane. On hatching, the larvae\r\nmay enter a blood capillary, drift along in the blood stream and finally\r\ncome to rest in a large blood-vessel that supplies a certain portion of the\r\nintestines with blood. Here the parasite develops. The wall of the vessel\r\nbecomes irritated and inflamed, pieces of fibrin flake off and drift along\r\nthe blood stream until finally a vessel too small for the floating particle\r\nto pass through is reached and the vessel becomes plugged. The loop of\r\nintestine supplied by it receives no blood. A temporary paralysis of the\r\nloop occurs, which persists until a second vessel is able to take over the\r\nfunction of the one that is plugged. This form of colic is most common in\r\nold horses (Fig. 16).\r\n\r\nSuch complications of acute indigestion as _twisting, infolding_ and\r\n_displacement of the intestine_ may occur. It is not uncommon for a\r\nstallion to suffer from strangulated hernia, due to a rather large internal\r\ninguinal ring and a loop of the intestine passing through it and into the\r\ninguinal canal or scrotum. Such displacements are usually accompanied by\r\nsevere colicky pains.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ vary in the different cases. In the mild form, the colicky\r\npains are not prominent, but in the acute form, the animal is restless,\r\ngetting up and down in the stall and rolling over. These movements are\r\nespecially marked when the abdominal pain is severe.\r\n\r\n_In the spasmodic form_ the attack comes on suddenly, the colicky pains are\r\nsevere, and the peristaltic movement of the intestine is marked and\r\naccompanied by loud intestinal sounds. In most cases of indigestion\r\ncharacterized by fermentation and collections of gas in the intestine there\r\nis gastric tympany as well.\r\n\r\nAcute indigestion characterized by _impaction_ of the large intestine\r\npursues a longer course than the forms just mentioned, and the abdominal\r\npain is not severe.\r\n\r\n_Congestion and inflammation_ of the intestine may result from the\r\nirritation produced by the feed. When this occurs, the abdominal pain is\r\nless violent. The animal usually acts dull, the walk is slow and unsteady,\r\nand the respirations and pulse beats may be quickened.\r\n\r\nA large percentage of the cases of acute indigestion terminate fatally. The\r\ncourse of the disease varies from a few hours to several days.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both _preventive_ and _curative_. The preventive\r\ntreatment is by far the most important. This consists in observing right\r\nmethods of feeding and caring for horses. The attendant should note the\r\ncondition of the animal before feeding grain, feed regularly and avoid\r\nsudden changes in feed. If a horse has received unusual exercise, it is\r\nproper to feed hay first, and when the animal is cooled out, water and feed\r\ngrain. Drinking a small quantity of water when tired or following a meal is\r\nnot injurious, but a large quantity of water taken at such times is\r\ninjurious and dangerous to the health of the animal. The feeding of spoiled\r\nor mouldy feeds to horses is highly injurious.\r\n\r\nThe horse should be given a roomy, comfortable stall that is well bedded,\r\nor a clean grass lot. If the attack appears when the animal is in harness,\r\nwe should stop working it and remove the harness immediately. Work or\r\nexercise usually aggravates the case and may cause congestion and\r\ninflammation of important body organs. In cold weather the animal should be\r\nprotected by blankets. If the pain is violent, sedatives may be given. The\r\ngaseous disturbances should be relieved by puncturing the wall of the\r\nintestine with the trocar and cannula. Rectal injections of cold water may\r\nbe resorted to. Fluid extract of cannabis indica in quarter ounce doses and\r\nrepeated in one hour may be given in linseed oil. In all cases it is\r\nadvisable to drench the animal with one pint of raw linseed oil and two\r\nounces of turpentine. Strychnine, eserine and pilocarpine are the drugs\r\ncommonly used by the veterinarians in the treatment of acute indigestion.\r\nSmall and repeated doses of the above drugs are preferred to large doses.\r\nThis is one of the diseases that requires prompt and skilled attention.\r\n\r\nSharp, uneven or diseased teeth should receive the necessary attention. In\r\nold horses, chopped hay or ground feeds should be fed when necessary.\r\nDebility resulting from hard work, wrong methods of feeding and intestinal\r\ndisorders must be corrected before the periodic attacks of indigestion can\r\nbe relieved. If the presence of intestinal worms is suspected, the\r\nnecessary treatment for ridding the animal of these parasites should be\r\nresorted to.\r\n\r\nBitter or saline tonics should be administered in the feed when necessary.\r\nThe following formula is useful as a digestive tonic: Sodium bicarbonate\r\nand sodium sulfate, one pound of each, powdered gentian one-half pound, and\r\noil meal five pounds. A small handful of this mixture may be given with the\r\nfeed two or three times daily.\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE INTESTINES.--The same causes mentioned in inflammation\r\nof the stomach and acute indigestion may cause this disease. It is most\r\nfrequent at times when there are great variations in the temperature.\r\nSudden cold or any influence that chills the surface of the body, or\r\ninternal cold caused by drinking ice water or eating frozen feed, may cause\r\nit. The infectious forms of enteritis are caused by germs and ptomaines in\r\nthe feed. Drinking filthy water or eating spoiled, mouldy feeds are common\r\ncauses. In cattle pasturing in low, marshy places, enteritis may be common.\r\nThe toxic form is caused by irritating poisons, such as caustic acids,\r\nalkalies and meat brine.\r\n\r\n_In the mild form of enteritis_ the appetite is irregular, the animal acts\r\ndull and stupid and may be noticed lying down more than common. Slight\r\nabdominal pains occur, especially following a meal. An elevation in the\r\nbody temperature may be noted and the animal may drink more water than\r\nusual. Constipation or a slight diarrhoea may be present. The feces may be\r\nsoft and foul smelling, coated with mucus, and slightly discolored with\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n_In the severe form of enteritis_ pressure on the abdomen may cause pain,\r\nthe respiration and pulse beats are quickened and the body temperature is\r\nelevated. The abdominal pain may be severe and the animal is greatly\r\ndepressed or acts dull. The movement of the intestines is suppressed at\r\nfirst and constipation occurs. Fermentation and the formation of gas may\r\ntake place. Later the intestinal peristalsis increases and a foul-smelling\r\ndiarrhoea sets in that is often mixed with blood. In the toxic form there\r\nmay be marked nervous symptoms. Spasms, convulsions, stupefaction and coma\r\nmay be manifested.\r\n\r\nIn the mild form recovery usually occurs within a few days. The more\r\nserious forms of the disease do not terminate so favorably. In the toxic\r\nform death usually occurs within a few days.\r\n\r\nThe large majority of cases of enteritis can be prevented by practising the\r\nnecessary _preventive measures_. It is very necessary that animals exposed\r\nto cold be provided with dry sleeping quarters that are free from draughts.\r\nWhere a number of animals are fed a heavy grain ration, or fed from the\r\nsame trough, they should be kept under close observation. This is necessary\r\nin order to detect cases of indigestion or overfeeding early, and resort to\r\nthe necessary lines of treatment, so as to prevent further irritation to\r\nthe intestinal tract. Live stock should not be forced to drink water that\r\nis ice-cold. Low, poorly-drained land is not a safe pasture for cattle and\r\nhorses. Spoiled roots, grains and silage, mouldy, dirty roughage and\r\ndecomposed slops should not be fed to live stock.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in withholding all feed and giving the animal\r\ncomfortable, quiet quarters--warm quarters and protection from the cold,\r\nproviding the animal with a heavy straw bed, or with blankets if necessary,\r\nif the weather is cold. From five to forty grains of calomel may be given,\r\ndepending upon the size of the animal and the frequency of the dose, two or\r\nthree times a day. In case the animal is suffering severe pain, morphine\r\ngiven hypodermically may be indicated. In the mild form and at the very\r\nbeginning of the attack, linseed oil may be administered to the larger\r\nanimals. The dose is about one quart. The smaller animals may be given\r\ncastor oil in from one- to four-ounce doses.\r\n\r\nWhen convalescence is reached the animal should be fed very carefully, as\r\nthe digestive tract is not in condition to digest heavy rations or feeds\r\nthat ferment readily.\r\n\r\nDIARRHOEA.--Diarrhoea occurs as a symptom of irritation and inflammation of\r\nthe intestinal mucous membrane. Sudden changes in the feed, the feeding of\r\na succulent green ration, severe exercise when the animal is not in\r\ncondition for it, and chronic indigestion may cause diarrhoea in the\r\nabsence of an intestinal inflammation.\r\n\r\n_The following symptoms_ may be noted: Animals affected by a diarrhoea act\r\ndull and weak; thirst is increased and the animal may show evidence of\r\nfever; the intestinal evacuations are soft, thin, and sometimes have an\r\noffensive odor. If the diarrhoea continues for several days, the animal\r\nloses flesh rapidly and the appetite is irregular. In such cases weakness\r\nis a prominent symptom.\r\n\r\nRecovery usually occurs when the animal is dieted and rested.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in giving a physic of linseed or castor oil.\r\nHorses and cattle may be given from one-half to one quart of linseed oil;\r\nsheep and hogs from one to four ounces of castor oil. Feed should be\r\nwithheld. Morphine may be given hypodermically to the large animals after a\r\nperiod of six to eight hours following the administration of the physic.\r\n\r\nThe following formula is quite useful in checking diarrhoea: salol one-half\r\nounce, bismuth subnitrate one ounce, and bicarbonate of soda two ounces.\r\nThe dose of this mixture is from one to four drachms, depending on the size\r\nof the animal, three or four times a day.\r\n\r\nWHITE SCOURS OR DIARRHOEA IN YOUNG ANIMALS.--Young animals, when nursing\r\nthe mother or fed by hand, frequently develop congestion and inflammation\r\nof the stomach and intestines. This disorder is characterized by a\r\ndiarrhoea.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ may be grouped under two heads: wrong methods of feeding and\r\ncare, and specific infection.\r\n\r\nThe first milk of the mother is a natural laxative and aids in ridding the\r\nintestine of the young of such waste material (meconium) as collects during\r\nfetal life. If this milk is withheld, the intestine becomes irritated,\r\nconstipation occurs, followed by a diarrhoea or serious symptoms of a\r\nnervous character, caused by the poisonous effect of the toxic substances\r\nabsorbed from the intestine on the nervous system.\r\n\r\nChanges in the ration fed the mother, excitement, unusual exercise and\r\ndisease change the composition of the mother's milk. Such milk is\r\nirritating to the stomach and intestines of the young. This irritation does\r\nnot always develop into a diarrhoea, but may result in a congestion of the\r\nstomach.\r\n\r\nWhen the young are raised artificially or by hand, and fed milk from\r\ndifferent mothers of the same or different species, or changed from whole\r\nto skim milk, acute and chronic digestive disorders that are accompanied by\r\na diarrhoea are common. Feeding calves from filthy pails, allowing them to\r\ndrink too rapidly and giving them fermented milk are common causes of\r\nscours.\r\n\r\nWhite scours caused by irritating germs is a highly infectious disease. The\r\ndisease-producing germs gain entrance to the body by way of the digestive\r\ntract and the umbilical cord.\r\n\r\nInsanitary conditions, such as dark, cold, damp, filthy quarters, lower the\r\nvitality of young animals, and predispose them to digestive disorders as\r\nwell as other diseases.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are as follows: Constipation accompanied by a feverish\r\ncondition precedes the diarrhoea; colicky pains are sometimes manifested;\r\nthe diarrhoea is usually accompanied by depression, falling off in appetite\r\nand weakness. At first the intestinal discharges are not very foul\r\nsmelling; later the odor is very disagreeable. The faeces may be made up\r\nlargely of undigested, decomposed milk that adheres to the tail and hind\r\nparts. If the diarrhoea is severe, the animal refuses to suckle or drink\r\nfrom the pail, and loses flesh rapidly. It is usually found lying down. The\r\nears droop and the depression is marked. The body temperature may vary from\r\nseveral degrees above to below the average normal.\r\n\r\n_The infectious form_ of white scours may be diagnosed by the history of\r\nthe outbreak. In this form of the disease, a large percentage of the young\r\nare affected and the death-rate is very high.\r\n\r\nCalves and lambs frequently die of an acute congestion of the fourth\r\nstomach. In this disease, the symptoms appear shortly after feeding. It is\r\ncharacterized by colicky pains, convulsions and coma.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is largely preventive. Young animals should be provided\r\nwith dry, clean, well-ventilated quarters and allowed plenty of exercise.\r\nColts thrive best if allowed to run in a blue grass pasture with the\r\nmother. If the mother is worked, suitable provisions in the way of quarters\r\nand frequent nursing should be provided. Calves, lambs and pigs are the\r\nmost frequent sufferers from insanitary quarters. In breeding, we should\r\nalways strive to get strong, vigorous, healthy young. The care given the\r\nmother in the way of exercise and feeding is an important factor here.\r\n\r\nThe first milk of the mother should not be withheld from the young,\r\nespecially if the animal is raised by hand. We must also feed it regularly\r\nand not too much at any one time. Any change in the milk should be made\r\ngradually, and it is usually advisable to reduce the ration slightly when\r\nsuch a change is made, so as not to overwork the digestive organs. Pails\r\nand bottles from which the animal feeds should be kept clean.\r\n\r\nColts raised on cow's milk must be fed and cared for carefully. The milk\r\nmust be sweet and made more digestible by diluting it with one-third water.\r\nA little sugar may be added. It is very advisable to add from one-half to\r\none ounce of lime water to each pint of milk fed. Frequent feeding is very\r\nnecessary at first, and we must not underestimate the quantity of milk\r\nnecessary to keep the colt in good condition. It should be taught to eat\r\ngrain as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nBecause of the irritated condition of the stomach and intestine, the animal\r\nsuffering from diarrhoea is unable to digest its feed. For this reason it\r\nis very important to withhold all feed for at least twelve hours. Water\r\nshould be provided. The alimentary tract is relieved of the irritating\r\nmaterial by giving the animal a physic of castor or linseed oil. The dose\r\nvaries from one-quarter to one-half ounce for the lamb and from one to four\r\nounces for the colt or calf. It is advisable in most cases to follow this\r\nwith the following mixture: bicarbonate of soda one ounce, bismuth\r\nsubnitrate one-half ounce, and salol one-quarter ounce. The dose for the\r\ncolt and calf is one teaspoonful three times a day. Lambs and pigs may be\r\ngiven from one-fourth to one-half the above dose.\r\n\r\nIt is usually advisable to give ewes and sows a physic if their young\r\ndevelop a diarrhoea. Mothers that are heavy milkers may be given a physic\r\nthe second or third day following birth. The ration should be reduced as\r\nwell during the first week.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT OF POULTRY\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION.--The digestive tract of poultry is composed of the\r\nfollowing organs: mouth, gullet, crop, stomach, gizzard and intestines,\r\nwith the two large glands, the liver and pancreas. The digestion of the\r\nfeed begins in the crop. Here the feed is held for a short time, mixed with\r\ncertain fluids and softened. On reaching the stomach it becomes mixed with\r\nthe digestive fluid secreted by the gastric glands. This second digestive\r\naction consists in thoroughly soaking the feed in the gastric juice, making\r\nit soft and preparing it for maceration by the heavily muscled gizzard.\r\nFollowing maceration it passes into the intestine. It is here that the\r\ndigestive action is completed and absorption occurs.\r\n\r\nUnder the conditions of domestication, poultry are subject to a great\r\nvariety of intestinal disorders.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE CROP.--Impaction and inflammation are the two common\r\ndiseases of the crop. _Large, impacted crops_ are usually caused by the\r\nfeeding of too much dry feed, fermentation of the contents of the crop and\r\nforeign bodies that obstruct the opening from the organ.\r\n\r\n_Inflammation of the crop_ is caused by excessive use of condiments in the\r\nfeed, putrid or spoiled feeds and eating caustic drugs, such as lime and\r\nrat poison.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are dulness, an indisposition to move about, drooping wings\r\nand efforts to eject gases and liquids. The crop is found greatly distended\r\nand either hard or soft, depending on the quantity of feed present and the\r\ncause of the distention. If fermentation is present the crop usually feels\r\nsoft.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in practising proper methods of\r\nfeeding. The _curative treatment_ of a recent case consists in manipulating\r\nthe mass of feed, breaking it up and forcing it upwards toward the mouth.\r\nIf difficulty in breaking up the mass is experienced, it is advisable to\r\nadminister a tablespoonful of castor oil to the bird.\r\n\r\nIf the above manipulations are unsuccessful, an operation is necessary.\r\nThis consists in making an opening through the skin and the wall of the\r\ncrop and removing the contents with tweezers. The opening must be closed\r\nwith sutures. The proper aseptic precautions must be observed.\r\n\r\nIn inflammation of the crop, the bird should be dieted for at least one\r\nday, and one teaspoonful of castor oil given as a laxative.\r\n\r\nACUTE AND CHRONIC INDIGESTION.--The recognition of special forms of\r\nindigestion in poultry is difficult. A flock of poultry that is subject to\r\ncareless and indifferent care may not thrive and a number of the birds\r\ndevelop digestive disorders. This may be indicated by an abnormal or\r\ndepraved appetite and emaciated condition. Constipation or diarrhoea may\r\noccur. In the more severe cases the bird acts dull, the feathers are\r\nruffled and it moves about very little.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in removing the cause, and giving the flock a\r\ntonic mixture in the feed. The following mixture may be used: powdered\r\ngentian and powdered ginger, eight ounces of each, Glauber's salts four\r\nounces, and sulfate of iron two ounces. One ounce of the above mixture may\r\nbe given in ten pounds of feed.\r\n\r\nWHITE DIARRHOEA OF YOUNG CHICKENS.--White diarrhoea is of the greatest\r\neconomic importance to the poultryman. The loss of chicks from this disease\r\nis greater than the combined loss resulting from all other diseases. It is\r\nstated by some authors that not less than fifty per cent of the chickens\r\nhatched die from white diarrhoea.\r\n\r\nSuch a heavy death-rate as is attributed to this disease can not result\r\nfrom improper methods of handling and insanitary conditions. Before it was\r\nproven that white diarrhoea was caused by specific germs, a great deal of\r\nemphasis was placed on such causes as debilitated breeding stock, improper\r\nincubation, poorly ventilated, overcrowded brooders, too high or too low\r\ntemperatures and filth. Such conditions are important predisposing factors,\r\nand may, in isolated cases, result in serious intestinal disorders.\r\n\r\n_The microorganisms causing_ this disease belong to both the plant and\r\nanimal kingdoms. Infection usually occurs within a day or two following\r\nhatching. Chicks two or three weeks of age seldom develop the acute form of\r\nthe disease. Incubator chicks are the most susceptible to the disorder.\r\n\r\n_The following symptoms occur_: The chicks present a droopy, sleepy\r\nappearance; the eyes are closed, and the chicks huddle together and peep\r\nmuch of the time; the whitish intestinal discharge is noticed adhering to\r\nthe fluff near the margins of the vent, and the young bird is very weak;\r\ndeath may occur within the first few days. After the first two weeks the\r\ndisease becomes less acute. In the highly acute form the chicks die without\r\nshowing the usual train of symptoms.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to differentiate between the infectious and the\r\nnon-infectious diarrhoea. In the latter, the percentage of chicks affected\r\nis small and the disease responds to treatment more readily than does the\r\ninfectious form. The death-rate in the latter form is about eighty per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ of diarrhoea in chicks from any cause is preventive. This\r\nconsists in removing the cause. No person can successfully handle poultry\r\nif he does not give the necessary attention to sanitation. Poultry houses,\r\nruns, watering fountains and feeding places must be constantly cleaned and\r\ndisinfected. The degree of attention necessary depends on the surroundings,\r\nthe crowded condition of the poultry houses and runs, and the presence of\r\ndisease in the flock. If disease is present, we can not clean and disinfect\r\nthe quarters too often. The attendant can not overlook details in handling\r\nthe incubator or brooder and feeding the chicks and be uniformly\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIf the disease is known to be present in the flock, the incubators and\r\nbrooders should be thoroughly disinfected by fumigating them with\r\nformaldehyde gas. If dirty, they should first be washed with a water\r\nsolution of a good disinfectant. For a period of from twenty-four to\r\nforty-eight hours after hatching, the chicks should receive no feed. Dr.\r\nKaupp recommends as an intestinal antiseptic, sulfocarbolate thirty grains,\r\nbichloride of mercury six grains, and citric acid three grains, dissolved\r\nin one gallon of water. This solution should be kept in front of the chicks\r\nall the time. A water solution of powdered copper sulfate (about one-half\r\nteaspoonful dissolved in one gallon of water) may be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n 1.

Because of its physiological influence over\r\nthe functions of the kidneys, intestines, and body in general and the\r\nvaried functions that it possesses, it is frequently affected by functional\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\nAll of the blood that comes directly from the intestine is received by the\r\nliver. It secretes the bile, neutralizes many of the poisonous substances\r\nand end products of digestion that are taken up by the absorbing vessels of\r\nthe intestine, and acts as a storehouse for the glycogen.\r\n\r\nIt can be readily understood from this brief statement of the nature of the\r\nliver functions, that any functional disorder of the liver may be far\r\nreaching in its effect. In many of the diseases that involve other organs,\r\nthe liver may be primarily affected. It is difficult to diagnose functional\r\ndisorders of the liver that are responsible for a diseased condition of\r\nsome other body organ. A knowledge of the physiology and pathology of the\r\nliver is of the greatest importance in the diagnosis of this class of\r\ndisorders.\r\n\r\nIn the larger domestic animals, symptoms of liver diseases are more obscure\r\nthan in the small animals. In certain parasitic diseases and in mixed and\r\nspecific infectious diseases, the liver may show marked pathological\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nCOMMON CAUSES OF LIVER DISORDERS.--Domestic animals commonly live under\r\nvery unnatural conditions. Ill results do not follow unless these\r\nconditions are so extreme as to violate practically all of the health laws.\r\nPampered animals are especially prone to liver disorders. The feeding of\r\ntoo heavy and too concentrated a ration together with insufficient exercise\r\nis one of the most common causes of disorders of the liver. The feeding of\r\na ration that is unsuitable for that particular species is a common source\r\nof disease in animals. For example, the feeding to carnivora of a ration\r\nmade up largely of starchy feed, and the feeding of a ration containing an\r\nexcessive quantity of protein to herbivorous animals may result in\r\nintestinal, liver and nervous disorders. Spoiled feed may prove highly\r\ninjurious. Catarrhal inflammation of the intestine and intestinal parasites\r\nmay obstruct the bile duct, and interfere seriously with the functions of\r\nthe liver.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms_.--In diseases of the liver the appetite is irregular or the\r\nanimal refuses to eat, is constipated, or has diarrhoea. The faeces may be\r\ngrayish colored or foul smelling. Colicky pains are sometimes manifested.\r\nUsually the animal acts dull and weak. A raise in body temperature may be\r\nnoted. The visible mucous membranes may appear yellowish- or brownish-red in\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_.--Animals grazing over well drained pastures that are free from\r\ninjurious weeds and provided with plenty of drinking water, seldom develop\r\ndiseases of the liver. Exercise, a natural diet and plenty of clean water,\r\nas well as preventing liver disorders, may be classed among the most\r\nimportant of all curative agents. Laxatives or cathartics, such as oils,\r\nsalts, aloes, and calomel, in small doses may be given. We prefer the\r\nadministration of oil or aloes to horses, Glauber's or Epsom salts to\r\nruminants, and calomel to dogs. The administration of minimum doses of\r\nthese drugs, and repeating the dose after a short interval, is preferable\r\nto large doses. Alkaline tonics are also indicated. The following mixture\r\nmay be given: bicarbonate of soda, sulfate of soda and common salt, eight\r\nounces of each, and powdered gentian and sulfate of iron, four ounces of\r\neach. Large animals may be given a small tablespoonful of this mixture with\r\nthe feed three times a day. The dose for sheep and hogs is one teaspoonful.\r\nA very light, easily digested ration should be fed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. What can be said of the importance of the liver?\r\n\r\n2. Tell something of its duties as a gland.\r\n\r\n3. In what animals are liver troubles most conspicuous when present?\r\n\r\n4. Give causes of liver disorders.\r\n\r\n5. What are the symptoms?\r\n\r\n6. What are the most important natural cures?\r\n\r\n7. What rule may be given for adapting suitable laxatives to different\r\n   classes of animals?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE URINARY ORGANS\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION.--The urinary apparatus is composed of two glands, the\r\nkidneys and an excretory apparatus that carries the excretion of the\r\nkidneys to the outside.\r\n\r\nThe kidneys are situated in the superior region of the abdominal cavity\r\n(sublumbar) above the peritoneum, and to the right and left of the median\r\nline. They are highly vascular glands, somewhat bean-shaped and of a deep\r\nred color. These glands are capable of removing from the blood a fluid that\r\nis essentially different in composition and which, if retained in the\r\nblood, would be harmful or poisonous to the body tissues.\r\n\r\nThe kidney excretions are carried from the pelvis of the kidneys by the\r\nright and left ureters. These canals terminate in the bladder, an\r\noval-shaped reservoir for the urine. This organ is situated in the\r\nposterior portion of the abdominal cavity and at the entrance to the pelvic\r\ncavity. Posteriorly, it forms a constricted portion or neck. It is here\r\nthat the urethra originates. This canal represents the last division of the\r\nexcretory apparatus. In the female, the urethra is short and terminates in\r\nthe vulva. In the male it is long and is supported by the penis.\r\n\r\nThe urine secreted by the kidneys is a body excretion, and consists of\r\nwater, organic matter and salts. The nitrogenous end-products, aromatic\r\ncompounds, coloring matter, and mucin form the organic matter. The\r\nnitrogenous end-products and aromatic compounds are urea, uric and hippuric\r\nacids, benzoic acid and ethereal sulfates of phenol and cresol. The salts\r\nare sulfates, phosphates and chlorides of sodium, potassium, calcium and\r\nmagnesium. The organic and inorganic matter varies with the ration.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of urine secreted within a given time varies in the different\r\nspecies and at different times in the same individual. In the horse the\r\nquantity secreted in twenty-four hours varies from twelve to fifteen pints;\r\nin cattle from ten to forty pints; in sheep from one-half to one and\r\nthree-quarter pints. The normal color of the urine varies. In the horse it\r\nis yellow or yellowish-red; in cattle and sheep yellowish; and in the dog a\r\nstraw yellow. The specific gravity varies with the quantity secreted and\r\nthe ration fed. When the quantity of urine secreted is above the average,\r\nthe specific gravity is usually low.\r\n\r\nTHE NECESSITY OF EXAMINING THE URINE.--In diseases of the urinary\r\napparatus, a careful examination of the urine is very necessary in order to\r\nbe able to form a correct diagnosis. In domestic animals it is impractical\r\nto attempt to determine the exact amount of urine passed within a certain\r\ntime, but we can make a general estimate of the quantity passed by\r\ncarefully observing the animal and noting the condition of the bedding in\r\nthe stall. The sample of urine to be examined is best taken from urine\r\ncollected at different periods during the day. We should note its color and\r\nconsistency. The different substances in the urine can be determined only\r\nby determining the specific gravity, testing with certain chemical reagents\r\nand by making a microscopic examination of the sediment. Normal urine from\r\nthe horse may be turbid or cloudy and more or less slimy, because of the\r\npresence of mucin. This is less true of other species. In disease the color\r\nof the urine may be changed to a pale yellow, red or brown. For example, in\r\ncongestion of the kidneys the urine is light in color and rather\r\ntransparent; in southern cattle fever it may be red; and in azoturia it may\r\nbe brown.\r\n\r\nEXCESSIVE URINATION.--The horse is the most common sufferer from excessive\r\nsecretion of urine. The most common _causes_ are musty feeds, such as hay,\r\ngrain and shipped feeds. New oats, succulent feeds and acrid plants may\r\nsometimes cause it. In the fall of the year, when the season is changing\r\nfrom warm to cool weather and the horse eliminates less water from the body\r\nby way of the skin, the kidneys may become more active and the quantity of\r\nurine secreted be greatly increased. This, however, is a normal\r\nphysiological condition and should not be confused with this disease.\r\n\r\nThe first _symptom_ noted is the frequent passing of a large quantity of\r\nurine. The animal drinks more water than usual and the appetite is poor.\r\nDulness and a weak, emaciated condition are prominent symptoms. Death\r\noccurs unless the cause of the disease is removed. If the poisonous\r\nsubstance has been acting for some time, it is difficult to cure the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThis disease can be _prevented_ by eliminating spoiled feeds from the\r\nration fed to animals in our care. Early in the attack the necessary\r\nattention to the ration and the feeding of a clean, nourishing ration is\r\nsufficient to correct the disease. The quantity of water drunk by the\r\nanimal should be limited. Complete rest is indicated. Laxatives, stimulants\r\nand tonics should be given if necessary.\r\n\r\nNEPHRITIS.--Congestion and inflammation of the kidneys commonly occur in\r\nmixed and specific infectious diseases, such as septicaemia, pyaemia and\r\ninfluenza. The toxic effect of spoiled feeds, impure drinking water, and\r\nirritating drugs like cantharides and turpentine may so irritate the\r\nkidneys as to cause them to become inflamed. Chilling of the skin and\r\nnervousness or extreme fear may sometimes cause a congestion of these\r\norgans. Inflammation of the kidneys is a common complication of azoturia.\r\nIrritation from parasites should be included among the causes of this\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms_ vary in the different stages of the disease. During the\r\nperiod of active congestion the quantity of urine secreted is increased.\r\nThe scant secretion of urine, dark in color and thick or turbid, is\r\nsuggestive of an inflammation of the kidneys. The animal moves stiffly, the\r\nback may be arched, urination is painful and the urine is passed in very\r\nsmall amounts. The appetite is irregular or suppressed, the pulse strong at\r\nfirst but later small and weak, and the body temperature is elevated. On\r\nmaking a rectal examination we find the bladder empty and the kidneys\r\nenlarged and sensitive.\r\n\r\nWhen the kidneys become so badly diseased that they can no longer perform\r\ntheir function of separating from the blood the nitrogenous end-products of\r\ndigestion, uraemic poisoning occurs. In this later stage of the disease the\r\nanimal staggers about if moved, and finally goes down in the stall and is\r\nunable to get up. Death is usually preceded by convulsions and coma.\r\n\r\n_The prognosis_ is very unfavorable, death occurring in the majority of\r\ncases. In azoturia of horses and in infectious diseases, the inflammation\r\nis nearly always acute. The color of the urine, its high specific gravity\r\nand the small quantity passed are valuable symptoms to consider in the\r\nrecognition of this disease. Chronic inflammation generally develops slowly\r\nand may not give rise to any very prominent symptoms at first.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ of nephritis consists in careful nursing of\r\nanimals affected with acute infectious diseases, a clean water supply and\r\navoiding the feeding of spoiled feeds. The _curative treatment_ is largely\r\ncareful nursing. The animal should be given comfortable, well-ventilated\r\nquarters and complete rest. Chilling of the skin should be especially\r\nguarded against by protecting the body with heavy blankets and applying\r\nroller bandages to the limbs when necessary. The diet must be of such a\r\nnature as not to increase the work of the kidneys. For the first few days\r\nthe animal should receive very little feed or water. Later a sloppy diet of\r\nsweet milk, green feed and mashes should be fed. Such purgatives as aloes\r\nand Glauber's salts are indicated at a very early stage in the disease. We\r\nmust encourage the elimination of waste products by way of the skin in the\r\nlarger animals by vigorous rubbing, blanketing and the administration of\r\nsuch drugs as pilocarpine. If the animal becomes weak, general and heart\r\ntonics may be given.\r\n\r\nCYSTITIS.--Inflammation of the bladder is not an uncommon disease of\r\nhorses. It is commonly _caused_ by retention of the urine, calculi in the\r\nbladder and chilling of the body. Irritating drugs that are eliminated from\r\nthe body in the urine, and infection of the bladder by germs may cause it.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are usually marked. The inflammation is characterized by\r\nmore or less pain, depending on the degree of the inflammation, and\r\nfrequent passing of urine. Only a small amount of urine is passed at each\r\nattempt, and in severe inflammation it may contain pus or blood. Colicky\r\npains sometimes occur. The pain is usually manifested by a stiff,\r\nstraddling gait and tenderness when pressure on the bladder is made by\r\nintroducing the hand into the rectum or vagina, and pressing over the\r\nregion of the bladder. General symptoms, such as elevation in body\r\ntemperature and irregular appetite, may be manifested.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ should be first directed at removing the cause. If a cystic\r\ncalculus is present in the bladder it should be removed. If the retention\r\nof the urine is caused by some local condition, and this is very often the\r\ncase in nervous, well-bred animals, this must first be corrected. It is\r\nbest to feed green and soft feeds, such as bran mash and chopped hay, and,\r\nif the animal will take them, gruels. A physic of castor or linseed oil\r\nshould be given occasionally. It is very necessary that the animal be kept\r\nquiet. Comfortable, clean quarters and a good bed should be provided.\r\nWhenever necessary the animal should be blanketed. The medicinal treatment\r\nconsists in irrigating the bladder with antiseptic solutions, and\r\nadministering drugs that when eliminated by way of the urine may change its\r\ncomposition and render it less irritating. The following mixture may be\r\ngiven: potassium chlorate two ounces, salol one-half ounce, and powdered\r\nnux vomica one ounce. This mixture may be divided into sixteen powders. One\r\nof the powders should be given with each feed.\r\n\r\nRETENTION OF THE URINE.--This may be due to a variety of _causes_. In the\r\nox and ram, small calculi collect in the S-shaped curvature of the urethra,\r\nor at its terminal extremity. In the horse, cystic calculi are more common\r\nthan urethral. In cattle and hogs, fatty secretions from the inflamed\r\nlining membrane of the sheath of the male may accumulate, and obstruct the\r\nflow of urine from the anterior opening. The giving of feed rich in salts,\r\nconcentrated urine resulting from feeding of too dry a ration, insufficient\r\nexercise and inflammation of the bladder are the direct causes of calculi.\r\n\r\nCompression of the urethra by growths or tumors, strictures of the urethra,\r\ndistended bladder, spasm of the neck of the bladder in nervous animals,\r\nparalysis of the bladder and injuries to the penis are common causes of\r\nretention of the urine.\r\n\r\n_The early symptoms in ruminants_ are not usually recognized until a day or\r\ntwo after retention of the urine has occurred. The symptoms are then quite\r\nmarked. The animal acts dull, refuses to eat, rumination is stopped, and\r\nthere is a constant effort to urinate, as indicated by the raising of the\r\ntail and rhythmical contractions of the urinary muscles just below the\r\nanus. Urine may dribble from the sheath or the flow may be completely\r\nsuppressed. The odor of urine may be marked.\r\n\r\n_Horses show symptoms_ of abdominal pain. The animal may move about the\r\nstall, lie down and get up again, or make unsuccessful attempts to urinate.\r\nOn examination the bladder is found to be greatly distended with urine. In\r\nthe horse the retention is recognized at an earlier period than in\r\nruminants, because of the prompt, decided symptom of pain.\r\n\r\nRetention of the urine commonly terminates in rupture of the bladder in\r\nruminants. When this occurs, the symptoms of pain are less evident. Death\r\noccurs from uraemic poisoning and peritonitis. The outcome is less\r\nfavorable in ruminants than in solipeds.\r\n\r\n_Inflammation of the sheath_ can be readily recognized because of the local\r\nswelling.\r\n\r\n_The following lines of treatment_ are recommended: A ration or feed that\r\nfavors the formation of calculi should not be fed to animals; inflammation\r\nof the sheath should receive prompt treatment--this consists in irrigating\r\nthe part with warm, soapy or alkaline water, followed by an antiseptic\r\nwash; we may attempt to work the urethral calculi forward and out of the\r\nS-curve in the urethra; if this is unsuccessful, urethrotomy for their\r\nremoval may be attempted.\r\n\r\nThe retention of the urine in horses, because of spasm or paralysis of\r\ncertain muscles, may be treated by passing the catheter. Sometimes\r\nspreading litter under the horse and keeping it quiet may induce it to\r\nurinate. Hot packs over the region of the back may be used. The treatment\r\nfor calculi is entirely surgical. The operation for the removal of cystic\r\ncalculi in the horse, although difficult, is followed by good results.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Describe the urinary apparatus.\r\n\r\n2. Give the composition of the urine and quantity secreted in the different\r\n   animals.\r\n\r\n3. State method of determining quantity and composition of urine secreted\r\n   by different domestic animals.\r\n\r\n4. Give the causes and treatment of excessive urination.\r\n\r\n5. Give the causes and treatment of congestion and inflammation of the\r\n   kidneys.\r\n\r\n6. Give the causes of cystitis; symptoms; treatment.\r\n\r\n7.

It is only through an understanding of these\r\nfunctions that we can prepare ourselves to correctly recognize, and\r\nsuccessfully treat, or prevent, such diseases as may involve the organs of\r\ngeneration. A knowledge of the structure and function of the generative\r\norgans of the female is of greater importance from the standpoint of\r\ndisease, than is a similar knowledge of the generative organs of the male.\r\nThe female is concerned with the complete reproductive process, which may\r\nbe divided into four stages. These are _copulation_, _fecundation_,\r\n_gestation_ and _parturition_. The male is concerned only with _copulation_\r\nand _fertilization_ of the ovum by the spermatozoa, while the female must\r\nprotect and nourish the embryo and foetus until it has become sufficiently\r\ndeveloped to live independently of the protection and nourishment afforded\r\nit within the womb. When the final stage of gestation is reached, birth or\r\nthe act of parturition occurs.\r\n\r\nGENITAL ORGANS OF THE FEMALE.--The female generative organs are the\r\novaries, fallopian tubules, uterus, vagina, vulva and mammary glands.\r\n\r\n_The ovaries_ are analogous to the testicles of the male. Their function is\r\nto secrete ova. This pair of glands is suspended from the superior region\r\n(sublumbar) of the abdominal cavity by folds of the lining membrane.\r\nLeading from the ovaries, but connected with the surface of these glands\r\nonly during the period of oestrum or heat, are the fallopian tubules. Their\r\nfunction is to carry the ovum from the ovaries to the uterus.\r\n\r\n_The uterus or womb_ is a membranous sack situated in the sublumbar region\r\nand at the inlet to the pelvic cavity. It is held in position by numerous\r\nfolds of the lining membrane of the abdominal cavity. We may divide the\r\nwomb into three divisions, cornua, body and cervix.\r\n\r\nThe cornua or horns are long and cylindrical in shape. This portion of the\r\nwomb is greatly developed in animals, like the sow and bitch, that give\r\nbirth to several young. In the impregnated animal the wall of the cornua\r\nthat contains one or several foetuses, and the body as well, becomes\r\ngreatly thickened and the lining membrane more vascular.\r\n\r\nThe body is short in all domestic animals and connects the horns with the\r\ncervix or neck. The latter is represented by a narrow portion that projects\r\nbackward into the vagina. In the cow the cervix is less prominent than in\r\nthe mare and the tissue that forms it, quite firm. In the cow the opening\r\nin the cervix, the os, is very small.\r\n\r\n_The vagina_ is a musculo-membranous canal that leads from the womb. In the\r\nmare and cow it is about one foot in length. Its function is to take part\r\nin copulation and parturition.\r\n\r\n_The vulva_ is the external opening of the maternal passages. It shows a\r\nvertical slit enclosed by lips, and interiorly it forms a passage that is\r\ncontinuous with the vagina. This passage is about six inches long in the\r\nlarger animals. The different features that should be noted are the\r\nclitoris, a small erectile organ located at the inferior portion of the\r\nopening, the meatus urinaris, the external opening of the urethra, situated\r\nin a depression in the floor of the vulva, and the hymen, an incomplete\r\nmembranous partition that may be found separating the vulva from the\r\nvagina.\r\n\r\n_The mammary glands or udders_ secrete the milk that nourishes the young.\r\nThe glands vary in number. The mare has two, the cow four (Fig. 17), the\r\newe two and animals that give birth to several young, eight or more. Each\r\ngland is surmounted by a teat or nipple. The glandular tissue consists of\r\ncaecal vesicles that form grape-like clusters around the milk tubules. The\r\nmilk tubules from the different portions of the gland converge and form\r\nlarger tubules that finally empty into small sinuses or reservoirs at the\r\nbase of the teat. Leading from these sinuses are one or several milk ducts\r\nthat open at the summit of the teat.\r\n\r\nGENITAL ORGANS OF THE MALE.--The genital organs of the male are the\r\ntesticles, the ducts or canals leading from the testicles, the seminal\r\nvesicles, the glands lying along the urethra, and the penis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Photograph of model of udder of cow: milk duct;\r\nmilk sinuses; and glandular tissue.]\r\n\r\n_The testicles_ are the glandular organs that secrete the spermatozoa, the\r\nessential elements of the seminal fluid. These glands are lodged in the\r\nscrotal sack, situated between the two thighs.\r\n\r\nLying along the superior border of the testicle is a mass of ducts, the\r\n_epididymis_. The _vas deferens_ is the canal or duct that passes\r\nfrom the epididymis to the region of the bladder and terminates near its\r\nneck by emptying into the seminal vesicles.\r\n\r\n_The seminal vesicles_ are two membranous pouches situated just above the\r\nbladder. They act as receptacles for the seminal fluid. Two short ducts,\r\nthe _ejaculatory_, carry the seminal fluid from the seminal vesicles to the\r\nurethra.\r\n\r\n_The prostate gland_ is situated near the origin of the urethra. _Cowper's\r\nglands_ lie along the course of the urethra and near the origin of the\r\npenis. These glands empty their secretions into the urethra and dilute the\r\nseminal fluid.\r\n\r\n_The penis_ is the male organ of copulation. It originates at the arch of\r\nthe ischium and extends forward between the thighs. It may be divided into\r\nfixed and free portions. The free portion is lodged in the prepuce or\r\nsheath, but at the time of erection protrudes from it.\r\n\r\nSTERILITY, IMPOTENCY.--Fecundation does not always follow intercourse of\r\nthe male and female. Impotency in the male and sterility in the female\r\nfrequently occur.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ are quite varied. A normal copulation may be impossible\r\nbecause of injuries to, and deformities of, the parts and tumor growths.\r\nDeformed genital organs and obstructions of the os by growths and scar\r\ntissue are causes of sterility in the female.\r\n\r\nFailure to breed is commonly caused by faulty methods of feeding and care.\r\nOver-feeding and insufficient exercise may result in the body tissues\r\nbecoming loaded with fat. This may cause a temporary sterility, but if\r\npersisted in, as is frequently the case in show animals, the sterility\r\nbecomes permanent because of the genital glands failing to secrete ova and\r\nspermatozoa, or the lack of vitality of the male and female elements. Old\r\nage and debility from disease or poor care may induce loss of sexual desire\r\nand an absence of, or weakened spermatozoa in, the seminal fluid. The\r\nrefusal of the male to serve certain females is sometimes noted.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis may affect the ovaries and cause permanent sterility. In\r\ninflammation of the lining membrane of the womb and vagina, the secretions\r\nare abnormal and may collect in the womb and the passages leading to it.\r\nThese secretions destroy the vitality of the spermatozoa, and this\r\ncondition may be considered a common cause of sterility in the larger\r\nanimals. Many vigorous young males are made impotent by excessive\r\ncopulation. The excessive use of the male at any time may result in failure\r\nto impregnate a large percentage of the females that he serves.\r\n\r\nBarren females do not become pregnant after frequent intercourse with the\r\nmale. Young sterile females may not come in heat. Sometimes unnatural\r\nperiods of heat are manifested, the animal coming in heat frequently or\r\nremaining in heat for a longer period than usual. This sometimes occurs in\r\ntuberculosis of the ovaries. In chronic inflammation of the maternal\r\npassage there is more or less discharge from the vulva. Both sexes may be\r\noverly fat or weakened and debilitated by disease. Deformity of the\r\ngenerative organs and growths may be found on making an examination.\r\nAbsence of, or lack of vitality of the spermatozoa may be determined by\r\nmicroscopic examination of the seminal fluid.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is largely preventive. It is very important that breeding\r\nanimals be kept in proper physical condition by avoiding the feeding of too\r\nheavy or too light a ration, and allowing them sufficient exercise. The\r\nmale is more often affected by the latter cause than the female. This is\r\nbecause the average stockman does not consider exercise given under the\r\nright conditions an important factor in maintaining the vigor of the male.\r\nYoung males should not be given excessive intercourse with the female. Such\r\npractice is certain to seriously affect the potency of the animal. The\r\nexcessive use of the stallion can be avoided by practising artificial\r\nimpregnation of a part of the mares that he is called to serve. Sterility\r\ncaused by growths and closure of the os may be corrected by an operation.\r\n\r\nChronic inflammation of the maternal passages should be treated by\r\nirrigating the parts with a one per cent warm water solution of lysol, or\r\nliquor cresolis compound. The parts should be irrigated daily for as long a\r\nperiod as necessary. Fat animals should be subjected to a rigid diet and\r\ngiven plenty of exercise. Following this treatment a stimulating ration may\r\nbe fed for the purpose of encouraging the sexual desire. In weak and\r\ndebilitated animals, the cause should first be removed and a proper ration\r\nfed. Cantharides and strychnine are the drugs most highly recommended for\r\nincreasing the sexual desire.\r\n\r\nSIGNS OF PREGNANCY.--The signs which characterize pregnancy are numerous\r\nand varied. For convenience we may classify the many signs of pregnancy\r\nunder two heads, probable and positive. Under the head of probable signs,\r\nwe may group the following symptoms of pregnancy: cessation of heat;\r\nchanges in the animal's disposition; increase in the volume of the abdomen\r\nand tendency to put on fat. The positive signs are the change in the volume\r\nof the udder; the secretion of milk; the movement of the foetus and\r\npresence of the foetus in the womb, as determined by rectal examination or\r\nby the feel of the abdomen.\r\n\r\n_The probable signs_ are not reliable, and should be considered only in\r\nconnection with some positive sign. Persons who base their opinion of the\r\ncondition of an animal that is supposed to be pregnant on probable signs,\r\nare frequently mistaken. It has frequently happened that animals whose\r\ncondition was not at all certain have given birth to young, without giving\r\nrise to what may be termed characteristic probable signs.\r\n\r\nThe earliest probable symptom is the cessation of heat. In the large\r\npregnant animals, irregular heat periods may occur, but in the majority of\r\ncases we may safely consider the animal impregnated if several heat periods\r\nare passed over.\r\n\r\nIt has been generally observed that the disposition of the pregnant animal\r\nis changed. They become more quiet and less nervous and irritable. The\r\ntendency of pregnant animals to put on fat is frequently taken advantage of\r\nby the stockman, who may allow the boar to run with the herd during the\r\nlatter period of fattening.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the volume of the abdomen may be considered a _positive_\r\nsign of pregnancy in the small animals, but in the mare and cow it can not\r\nbe depended on. Animals that are pregnant for the first time, do not show\r\nas great an increase in the volume of the abdomen as do animals that have\r\ngone through successive pregnant periods. The volume of the abdomen may\r\nvary greatly in the different individuals, and can not be depended on as a\r\npositive indication of pregnancy during the first two-thirds of the period\r\nof pregnancy in the larger domestic animals.\r\n\r\nComparatively early in pregnancy, the presence of a foetus can be\r\ndetermined by feeling the uterus through the wall of the rectum. In the\r\nsmall domestic animals the feeling of the abdomen gives the best results.\r\nIn the cow this method of diagnosis is practised during the latter periods\r\nof pregnancy. The examiner stands with his back toward the animal's head,\r\nand on the right side of the cow and the left side of the mare. The palm of\r\nthe hand is applied against the abdominal wall, about eight or ten inches\r\nin front of the stifle and just below the flank. Moderate pressure is used,\r\nand if a hard, voluminous mass is felt, or if the foetus moves, it is a\r\nsure sign that the animal is pregnant. It is not uncommon for the foetus to\r\nshow some movement in the morning, or after the animal drinks freely of\r\ncold water. The increase in the volume of the udder occurs at a\r\ncomparatively early period in animals that are pregnant for the first time.\r\nThe secretion of milk and the dropping of the muscles of the quarters\r\nindicate that parturition is near. The Abderhalden test for determining\r\nwhether or not an animal is pregnant is now practised.\r\n\r\nHYGIENE OF PREGNANT ANIMALS.--Pregnant animals that are confined in a\r\npasture that is free from injurious weeds and not too rough or hilly, and\r\nwhere the animals have access to clean water and the necessary shelter,\r\nseldom suffer from an abnormal birth. Here they live under the most\r\nfavorable conditions for taking exercise, securing a suitable diet and\r\navoiding injury. It may not be possible in managing breeding animals to\r\nprovide such surroundings at all times, but we should observe every\r\npossible hygienic precaution, especially if the animal has reached the\r\nlater periods of pregnancy.\r\n\r\nAll pregnant animals are inclined to be lazy, but, if permitted, will take\r\nthe necessary exercise. Pregnant mares are usually worked. Such exercise\r\ndoes no harm, providing the work is not hard or of an unusual character.\r\nCows are usually subject to more natural conditions than other domestic\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nProtecting pregnant animals against injuries resulting from crowding,\r\nslipping and fighting is an important part of their care. Injuries from\r\ncrowding together in the sleeping quarters and about feeding-troughs, or\r\nthrough doors and climbing over low partitions are common causes of injury\r\nin pregnant sows. Crowding together in the stable or yard, or through\r\ndoorways, fighting, and slipping on floors, or icy places sometimes results\r\nin injury. It is rare, however, for cows to abort from an injury, but\r\nparturition may not be completely free from disagreeable complications.\r\nUnder the conditions mentioned retention of the fetal membranes is common.\r\n\r\nEwes frequently suffer from too close confinement during late winter. Sows\r\nare often subject to the most unhygienic conditions. This is shown in the\r\nheavy death-rate in sows and pigs. During the late winter and early spring\r\nthe conditions may be such as not to permit of exercise. Stormy, snowy,\r\nmuddy weather is common at this season of the year. Persons caring for ewes\r\nand sows should see that they take sufficient exercise. It may be necessary\r\nto drive them about for a short time each day. At such times it may be\r\nadvisable to give them a laxative dose of oil, or give a laxative with the\r\nfeed. When there is any indication of constipation, this should be\r\npractised.\r\n\r\nPregnant animals should be fed carefully. We may feed animals that are not\r\nin this condition in a careless fashion, but if pregnant, over-feeding, the\r\nfeeding of a fattening ration, or spoiled feed, and sudden changes in the\r\nfeed can not be practised with any degree of safety. A bulky ration of dry\r\nfeed and drinking impure, or too little, water may cause constipation,\r\nacute indigestion and abortion. The ration fed should contain the necessary\r\ninorganic and organic elements for the building up of the body tissues of\r\nthe foetus.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the parturition period, separate quarters should be provided.\r\nThe mare or cow should be given a comfortable clean stall away from the\r\nother animals. The ewe should be provided with a warm room if the weather\r\nis cold. It is always best to give the sow a separate pen that is dry and\r\nclean, and away from the other animals. All danger from injury to the\r\nmother and young should be guarded against.\r\n\r\nABORTION.--The expulsion of the foetus at any time during the period of\r\ngestation, when it is not sufficiently developed to live independently of\r\nthe mother, is termed abortion. Abortion may be either _accidental_ or\r\n_infectious_. Accidental abortion is more commonly met with in the mare and\r\nsow than the infectious form. In ruminants the opposite holds true.\r\n\r\n_The causes of accidental abortion_ are faulty methods of feeding and care.\r\nInjuries, acute indigestion, mouldy, spoiled feeds, chilling resulting from\r\nexposure and drinking ice-cold water, nervousness brought on by fright, or\r\nexcitement and general diseases are the common causes of abortion.\r\n\r\n_Infectious abortion_ is most common in cows. Other domestic animals that\r\nmay be affected are the mare, sow and ewe.\r\n\r\n_It is caused_ by a specific germ. The _Bacillus abortus_ of Bang is the\r\ncause of abortion in cows, but the specific germ that produces abortion in\r\nother species of animals has not been proven. In this country, Keer, Good,\r\nGiltner and others have proven that the Bang bacillus of abortion is\r\ninfectious for other species of animals, and outbreaks of this disease have\r\nbeen said to occur among breeding ewes pastured and fed on infected\r\npremises. Its infectiousness for the females of other species has never\r\nbeen proven in natural outbreaks.\r\n\r\nThe disease-producing germs are present in the body of the foetus, the\r\nfetal membranes, the discharge from the maternal passages, the faeces and\r\nmilk of aborting animals. The male may carry the infection in the sheath,\r\nurethra and on the penis. The natural avenues of infection are the maternal\r\npassages and digestive tract.\r\n\r\nIt is very seldom that abortion is carried from one herd to another by\r\nmeans other than through the breeding of animals free from abortion to\r\nanimals affected by this disease. The purchase of a bull or cow from an\r\ninfected herd and breeding them to animals that are free from disease, is a\r\ncommon method of spreading the disease. After serving the diseased animal,\r\nthe male may carry the bacillus of abortion into the maternal passages of\r\nthe next cow he serves. There are numerous cases on record where the bull\r\nwas a permanent carrier of the Bacillus abortus and infected nearly every\r\nanimal served. The distribution of the disease in the herd following the\r\nintroduction of a cow, sow, or ewe that has aborted before or after being\r\npurchased, takes place through contact of the other animals with the virus\r\nthat may be present on the floor, or in the manure, or by taking the virus\r\ninto the digestive tract along with the feed and drinking water.\r\nExperimental evidence indicates the latter avenue of infection.\r\n\r\nThe stallion is the most common source of infectious abortion in mares. An\r\ninfected stallion may distribute the disease to a large percentage of the\r\nmares that he serves. For this reason nearly all of the mares in a certain\r\nlocality may abort.\r\n\r\nIn case the infection occurs at the time of service, the abortion usually\r\ntakes place during the first half of the period of pregnancy. Cows that\r\nbecome pregnant without recovering from the inflammation of the lining\r\nmembrane of the genital tract, may abort at a very early period. McFadyean\r\nand Stockman from the artificially inoculated cases of infectious abortion\r\nin cows, showed that the period of incubation averaged 126 days.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms of accidental abortion_ are extremely variable. Animals that\r\nabort during the early periods of pregnancy may show so little disturbance,\r\nthat the animal can be treated as if nothing had happened. During the\r\nlatter half of pregnancy, and especially when the accident is caused by an\r\ninjury, the symptoms are more serious. Loss of appetite, dulness,\r\nrestlessness, abdominal pain and haemorrhage are the symptoms commonly\r\nnoted. If the foetus is dead, it may be necessary to assist the animal in\r\nexpelling it. In the latter case, death of the mother may occur.\r\n\r\nA slight falling of the flanks, swelling of the lips of the vulva and a\r\nretention of the fetal membranes, or discharge from the vulva may be the\r\nonly symptoms noted at the time abortion occurs.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms of infectious abortion_ vary in the different periods of\r\npregnancy. At an early period, the foetus may be passed with so little\r\nevidence of labor that the animal pays little attention to it. The\r\nrecurrence of heat may be the first intimation of the abortion. All cases\r\nof abortion are followed by more or less discharge from the vulva. This is\r\nespecially true if the fetal membranes are retained. In such cases, the\r\ndischarge has a very disagreeable odor. In most cases the foetus is dead.\r\nWhen born alive, it is weak and puny, and usually dies or is destroyed\r\nwithin a few days. When the attendant fails to give the animal the\r\nnecessary attention, or is careless in his manipulation of the parts,\r\ninflammation of the womb, caused by the decomposition of the retained\r\nmembranes, or the introduction of irritating germs on the ropes,\r\ninstruments and hands, may occur. Death commonly follows this complication.\r\n\r\nIt is very important that the infectious form be diagnosed early in the\r\noutbreak. For all practical purposes we are justified in diagnosing\r\ninfectious abortion, if several animals in the herd abort, especially if it\r\nfollows the introduction of new animals. Methods of serum diagnosis, the\r\nagglutination and complement-fixation tests, are now used in the diagnosis\r\nof this disease.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ of the accidental form consists in avoiding\r\nconditions that may result in this accident. Pregnant animals should not be\r\nexposed to injuries from other animals or from the surroundings. Animals\r\nwhich show a predisposition to abort should not be bred. We should see that\r\nall animals receive the necessary exercise and a proper ration.\r\n\r\nIf the animal indicates by her actions that abortion may take place, we\r\nshould give her comfortable, quiet quarters. It is very necessary to keep\r\nher quiet, and if restless, morphine may be given. A very light diet should\r\nbe fed and constipation prevented by administering a laxative. The\r\nnecessary attention should be given in case abortion occurs.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of _preventive_ or _quarantine measures_ is very important\r\nin the control of infectious abortion. This is especially true of breeding\r\nherds and dairy cows. Breeders do not recognize the importance of keeping\r\ntheir herds clean or free from disease. It is a well-known fact among\r\nstockmen that abortion and other infectious diseases have been frequently\r\nintroduced into the herd through the purchase of one or more breeding\r\nanimals. Because of the prevalence of infectious abortion among cows, it is\r\nadvisable to subject newly purchased breeding animals, or a cow that has\r\nbeen bred outside of the herd, to a short quarantine period before allowing\r\nthem to mix with the herd. The breeding of cows from neighboring herds to\r\nthe herd bull is not a safe practice. In communities where there are\r\noutbreaks of this disease, animals that abort, or show indications of\r\naborting, should be quarantined for a period of from two to three months.\r\nThe separation from the herd should be so complete as to eliminate any\r\ndanger of carrying the disease to the healthy animals on the clothing and\r\nfarm tools. If this method of control were practised at the very beginning\r\nof the outbreaks, the disease could be checked in the large majority of\r\nherds.\r\n\r\nThe foetus and membranes should be destroyed by burning. In case the animal\r\ndoes not pass the fetal membranes, they should be completely removed. In\r\nthe cow, it is advisable to wait twenty-four hours before doing this. The\r\nanimal's stall should be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected. It is very\r\nadvisable to give the entire stable a thorough disinfecting. For this\r\npurpose a three or four per cent water solution of liquor cresolis compound\r\nmay be used. It is advisable to apply it with a spray pump. The floor and\r\nfeed troughs should be sprinkled daily with the disinfectant. All manure\r\nshould be removed to a place where the animals can not come in contact with\r\nit. It is not advisable to confine the cows to a small yard. The more range\r\nthey have the easier it is to control the disease.\r\n\r\n_Individual treatment_ is very necessary. In infectious abortion the mucous\r\nlining of the womb and the passages leading to it become inflamed. This\r\nshould be treated by irrigating the parts with a warm water solution of a\r\ndisinfectant that is non-irritating. This treatment should be repeated\r\ndaily for a period of from two to four weeks. We must be very careful not\r\nto irritate the parts. A one-half per cent water solution of liquor\r\ncresolis compound may be used.\r\n\r\nAnimals that abort should not be bred until they have completely recovered.\r\nSmall animals that have no special value as breeding animals should be\r\nmarketed. Cows and mares should not be bred for a period of at least three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nInfected males should not be used for service. The male should receive the\r\nnecessary attention in the way of irrigating the sheath before and after\r\neach service.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGY OF PARTURITION.--Parturition or birth, when occurring in the\r\nmare, is designated as foaling; in the cow, calving; in the sheep, lambing;\r\nand in the sow, farrowing. A normal or natural birth occurs when no\r\ncomplications are present and the mother needs no assistance. When the act\r\nis complicated and prolonged, it is termed abnormal birth. The length of\r\ntime required for different individuals of the same species to give birth\r\nto their young varies widely. It may require but a few minutes, or be\r\nprolonged for a day or more. The cause of this variation in the length of\r\ntime required for different animals to bring forth their young, can be\r\nbetter understood if we study the anatomy of the parts and their functions.\r\n\r\nThroughout the pregnant period the _expulsion of the foetus_ is being\r\nprepared for. As the foetus develops there is a corresponding development\r\nof the muscular wall of the womb. The last period of pregnancy is\r\ncharacterized by the relaxation of the muscles and ligaments that form the\r\npelvic walls, and a relaxation and dilation of the maternal passages. In\r\naddition, degenerative changes occur in the structures that attach the\r\nfoetus to the womb, the normal structures being gradually destroyed by a\r\nfatty degeneration. This results in a separation between the fetal and\r\nmaternal placenta. The contents of the womb begin to affect the organ in\r\nthe same manner as a foreign body, irritating the nerve endings and\r\nproducing contractions of the muscles. These contractions of the muscles\r\nhelp greatly in breaking down the attachments until finally the labor pains\r\nbegin in earnest, and the foetus is gradually forced out of the womb,\r\nthrough the dilated os and into the vagina and vulva.\r\n\r\n_A normal birth_ is possible, only when the expelling power of the womb is\r\nable to overcome the resistance offered by the foetus and its membranes,\r\nthe pelvic walls and the vagina and vulva.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Photograph of model of uterus of cow containing a\r\nfoetus: foetus; umbilical cord; placenta; horn containing foetus; and\r\nopposite horn. Note the difference in the development of the two horns.]\r\n\r\nThe relative size of the foetus to the inlet of the pelvic cavity and its\r\nposition are the most important factors for the veterinarian and stockman\r\nto consider (Fig. 18). On leaving the womb, the foetus passes into the\r\nvagina and vulva. This portion of the maternal passages is situated in the\r\npelvic cavity which continues the abdominal cavity posteriorly. The pelvic\r\nwalls are formed by bones and ligaments that are covered by heavy muscles.\r\nAs previously mentioned, the ligaments and muscles relax toward the end of\r\npregnancy in order to prepare the way for the passage of the foetus. Before\r\nentering the pelvis it is necessary for the foetus to be forced through the\r\ninlet to this cavity. This is the most difficult part of the birth, as the\r\nbones that form the framework of the pelvis completely enclose the entrance\r\nto it. It is only in the young mother that the pelvic bones give way\r\nslightly to the pressure on them by the foetus. It can be readily\r\nunderstood, that when the young is large in proportion to the diameter of\r\nthe pelvic inlet, it is difficult for it to pass through. This occurs when\r\nmothers belonging to a small breed, are impregnated by a sire belonging to\r\na large breed of animals. It may also occur if the mother is fed too\r\nfattening a ration and not permitted sufficient exercise.\r\n\r\nThe part of the foetus that presents itself for entrance into the pelvic\r\ncavity and its position are of the greatest importance in giving birth to\r\nthe young. Either end of the foetus, or its middle portion may be presented\r\nfor entrance. The _anterior_ and _posterior presentations_ may be modified\r\nby the position that the foetus assumes. It may be in a position that\r\nplaces the back or vertebrae opposite the upper portion of the inlet, or\r\nthe floor or sides of the pelvic cavity. These positions may be modified by\r\nthe position of one or both limbs, or the head and neck being directed\r\nforwards instead of backwards. In the _transverse presentations_, the back,\r\nor the feet and abdomen of the foetus may present themselves for entrance\r\nto the pelvic cavity. These presentations may show three positions each.\r\nThe head may be opposite the upper walls of the inlet, the foetus assuming\r\na dog-sitting position, or it may lie on either side.\r\n\r\nIn order to overcome the friction between the foetus and the wall of the\r\nmaternal passages, these parts are lubricated by the fluids that escape\r\nfrom the \"water bags.\" If birth is prolonged and the passages become dry,\r\nbirth is retarded. The hair offers some resistance in a posterior\r\npresentation. Young mares that become hysterical have abnormal labor pains\r\nthat seem to hold the foetus in the womb instead of expelling it.\r\n\r\nCARE OF THE MOTHER AND YOUNG.--Although birth is generally easy in the\r\ndifferent domestic animals, it may be difficult and complicated, and it is\r\nof the greatest economic importance that special attention be given the\r\nmother at this time. It is very necessary for her to be free if confined in\r\na stall. If running in a pasture or lot, the necessary shelter from storms,\r\ncold or extreme heat should be provided. Other farm animals, such as hogs,\r\nhorses and cattle, should not be allowed to run in the same lot or pasture.\r\n\r\nWhen parturition commences, the mother should be kept under close\r\nobservation. If the labor is difficult and prolonged, we may then examine\r\nthe parts and determine the cause of the abnormal birth. Unnecessary\r\nmeddling is not advisable. Before attempting this examination, the hands\r\nshould be cleaned and disinfected, and the finger nails shortened if\r\nnecessary. The different conditions to be determined are the nature of the\r\nlabor pains, the condition of the maternal passages, and the position and\r\npresentation of the foetus. In the smaller animals this examination may be\r\ndifficult. In prolonged labor the parts may be found dry and the labor\r\npains violent and irregular, or weak. The foetus may be jammed tightly into\r\nthe pelvic inlet, it may be well forward in the womb, the head and fore or\r\nhind limbs may be directed backwards, or one or more of these parts may be\r\ndirected forward in such a position as to prevent the entrance of the\r\nfoetus into the pelvic inlet. Sometimes the foetus is in a transverse\r\nposition. The parts that present themselves at the pelvic inlet should be\r\ncarefully examined and their position determined. The necessary assistance\r\nshould then be given. Any delay in assisting in the birth may result in the\r\ndeath of the young or mother, or both. On the other hand, unintelligent\r\nmeddling may aggravate the case and render treatment difficult or\r\nimpossible. There is no line of veterinary work that requires the attention\r\nof a skilled veterinarian more than assisting an irregular or abnormal\r\nbirth.\r\n\r\nThe attendant must guard against infecting the parts with irritating germs,\r\nor irritating and injuring them in any way. The hands, instruments, and\r\ncords must be freed from germs by washing with a disinfectant, or\r\nsterilization with heat. The quarters must be clean in order to prevent\r\ncontamination of the instruments and clothing of the attendant by filth.\r\nExtreme force is injurious. For illustration, we may take a case of\r\ndifficult birth caused by an unusually large foetus. Both presentation and\r\nposition are normal, the forefeet and head having entered the pelvic\r\ncavity, but the shoulders and chest are jammed tightly in the inlet, and\r\nthe progress of the foetus along the maternal passages is retarded. By\r\nusing sufficient force, we may succeed in delivering the young, but by\r\npulling on one limb until the shoulder has entered the pelvis, and\r\nrepeating this with the opposite limb we are able to deliver the young\r\nwithout exposing the mother to injury. It may be necessary to change an\r\nabnormal presentation, or position, to a normal presentation, or as nearly\r\nnormal as possible. This should be done before any attempt is made to\r\nremove the foetus.\r\n\r\nFollowing birth the mother should not be unnecessarily disturbed. The\r\nquarters should be clean, well bedded and ventilated, but free from\r\ndraughts. If the parturition has been normal, a small quantity of easily\r\ndigested feed may be fed. If weak and feverish, feed should be withheld for\r\nat least twelve hours. The mare should be rested for a few weeks. The young\r\nneeds no special attention if it is strong and vigorous, but if weak, it\r\nmay be necessary to support it while nursing, or milk the mother and feed\r\nit by hand. If the mother is nervous and irritable, it may be necessary to\r\nremove the young temporarily to a place where she can hear and see it,\r\nuntil a time when she can be induced to care for it. The principal\r\nattention required for young pigs is protection against being crushed by\r\nthe mother. The cutting off and ligation of the umbilical cord at a point a\r\nfew inches from the abdomen, and applying tincture of iodine or any\r\nreliable disinfectant is very advisable in the colt and calf.\r\n\r\nRETENTION OF THE FETAL MEMBRANES.--The foetus is enveloped by several\r\nlayers of membranes. The _external envelope, the chorion_, is exactly\r\nadapted to the uterus. The _innermost envelope, the amnion_, encloses the\r\nfoetus. Covering the external face of the amnion and lining the inner face\r\nof the chorion is a double membrane, _the allantois_. The envelopes\r\nmentioned are not the only protection that the foetus has against injury.\r\nIt is enveloped in fluids as well. Immediately surrounding it is the\r\n_liquor amnii_, and within allantois is the _allantoic fluid._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Placenta of cow.]\r\n\r\n_The placenta_ is a highly vascular structure spread out or scattered over\r\nthe surface of the chorion and the mucous membrane of the uterus, that\r\nattaches the foetus and its envelopes to the womb (Fig. 19). It is by means\r\nof this vascular apparatus that the foetus is furnished with nourishment.\r\nThe fetal and maternal placentas are made up of vascular villi and\r\ndepressions that are separated only by the thin walls of capillaries, and a\r\nlayer of epithelial cells. This permits a change of material between the\r\nfetal and maternal circulation. The arrangement of the placenta differs in\r\nthe different species. In the mare and sow, the villi are diffused. In\r\nruminants, the villi are grouped at certain points. These vascular masses\r\nare termed cotyledons. The maternal cotyledons or \"buttons\" form appendages\r\nor thickened points that become greatly enlarged in the pregnant animal.\r\n\r\nToward the end of the pregnant period, the attachments between the fetal\r\nand maternal placentulae undergo a fatty degeneration and finally separate.\r\nThis results in contractions of the muscular wall of the uterus, and the\r\nexpulsion of the foetus and its envelopes. In the mare, it is not uncommon\r\nfor the colt to be born with the covering intact. This does not occur in\r\nthe cow. Usually the envelopes are not expelled until a short time after\r\nbirth in all animals, and it is not uncommon for them to be retained. This\r\ncomplication is most commonly met with in the cow.\r\n\r\nIn the mare the _retention of the fetal envelopes_ or \"afterbirth\" is\r\ncommonly due to the muscles of the womb not contracting properly following\r\nbirth. Abortion, especially the infectious form, is commonly complicated by\r\na retention of the fetal membranes. Any condition that may produce an\r\ninflammation of the lining membrane of the womb may result in retention of\r\nthe \"after-birth.\" Injuries to the uterus resulting from the animal\r\nslipping, fighting and becoming crowded are, no doubt, common causes of\r\nfailure to \"clean\" in cows.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are so marked that a mistaken diagnosis is seldom made. A\r\nportion of the membranes is usually seen hanging from the vulva, and the\r\ntail and hind parts may be more or less soiled. The latter symptom is\r\nespecially prominent if the membranes have been retained for several days,\r\nand decomposition has begun. In such case, the discharge from the vulva is\r\ndark in color, contains small pieces of the decomposed membrane and has a\r\nvery disagreeable odor. In the mare, acute inflammation of the womb may\r\nresult if the removal of the \"after-birth\" is neglected. Loss of appetite,\r\nabnormal body temperature, weakness and diarrhoea may follow. Such cases\r\nusually terminate in death. Retention of the fetal membranes is a very\r\ncommon cause of leucorrhoea.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in removing the fetal envelopes before there is\r\nany opportunity for them to undergo decomposition. In the mare, this should\r\nbe practised within a few hours after birth has occurred, and in other\r\nanimals, from one to forty-eight hours. In warm stables and during the warm\r\nweather, treatment should not be postponed later than twenty-four hours.\r\nThe only successful method of treatment is to introduce the hand and arm\r\ninto the uterus, and break down the attachments with the fingers. In the\r\nlarger animals, the use of the arm must not be interfered with by clothing.\r\nEvery possible precaution should be taken to prevent infection of the\r\ngenital organs with irritating germs. It is advisable in most cases to\r\nflush out the womb with a one per cent water solution of liquor cresolis\r\ncompound after the removal of the fetal envelopes.\r\n\r\nLEUCORRHOEA.--This is a chronic inflammation of the mucous membrane lining\r\nthe genital tract, that is associated with more or less of a discharge from\r\nthe vulva. It is common in animals that abort, or retain the \"after-birth.\"\r\n\r\nThe discharge may be white, sticky, albuminous, and without odor, or it may\r\nbe chocolate colored and foul smelling. The tail and hind parts are usually\r\nsoiled with it. In chronic inflammation of the womb the discharge is\r\nintermittent. In mild cases the health of the animal is in no way impaired.\r\nSterility is common. Loss of appetite and unthriftiness occur in severe\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_.--Mild cases readily yield to treatment. This consists in\r\nirrigating the maternal passages with a one-half per cent warm water\r\nsolution of liquor cresolis compound. This treatment should be repeated\r\ndaily and continued for as long a time as necessary.\r\n\r\nMAMMITIS.--Inflammation of the mammary gland or udder is more common in the\r\ncow than in any of the other domestic animals. In all animals it is most\r\nfrequently met with during the first few weeks after birth.\r\n\r\n_A predisposing cause_ in the development of mammitis is a high development\r\nof the mammary glands. The following _direct causes_ may be mentioned:\r\nincomplete milking, or milking at irregular intervals; injury to the udder\r\nby stepping on the teat; blows from the horns and pressure caused by lying\r\non a rough, uneven surface; chilling of the udder by draughts and lying on\r\nfrozen ground; and infection of the glandular tissue by _irritating germs_.\r\nThe latter cause produces the most serious, and, sometimes, a very\r\nextensive inflammation. This form of inflammation may spread from one cow\r\nto another, causing the milk to be unfit for food, and bringing about the\r\nloss of one or more quarters of the udder.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ occurring in the different forms of mammitis differ. The\r\ninflammation may involve one or more of the glands, and may affect either\r\nthe glandular or the connective tissue. In some cases the gland may appear\r\ncongested for a few days before the inflammatory changes occur. The part\r\nbecomes hot, swollen, tender and reddened. It may feel doughy or hard. If\r\nthe connective tissue is involved (interstitial form), there is apt to be a\r\nhigh body temperature, the udder may be much larger than normal, is tender\r\nand pits on pressure. Loss of appetite usually accompanies this form of\r\nmammitis. Very little or no milk is secreted. Sometimes, the milk is\r\ngreatly changed in appearance, is foul smelling and contains pus. In\r\ncongestion of the udder and rupture of the capillary vessels, the milk may\r\ncontain blood.\r\n\r\nMild inflammation of the udder responds readily to treatment. The\r\ninterstitial form may terminate in abscesses and gangrene. The replacement\r\nof the glandular tissue by fibrous tissue in one or more quarters is not\r\nuncommon. Death seldom occurs.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in avoiding conditions that may favor\r\nor cause an inflammation of the gland. Animals that have highly developed\r\nmammary glands should be fed a light diet just before and following\r\nparturition. Following parturition, a dose of Epsom or Glauber's salts may\r\nbe given. If the young does not take all the milk, the udder should be\r\nmilked out as clean as possible. Massaging the udder by kneading or\r\nstroking may be practised.\r\n\r\nThe following _treatment_ is recommended: The application of a thick\r\ncoating of antiphlogistin once or twice daily is a useful remedy. If the\r\nudder becomes badly swollen, it should be supported with a bandage.\r\nExtensive inflammation may be treated by the application of cold in the\r\nform of packs of cracked ice. Irrigating the gland with a four per cent\r\nwater solution of boric acid is an important treatment for certain forms of\r\nmammitis. Abscess formation or suppuration should be promptly treated by\r\nopening and treating the abscesses. If gangrene occurs, it may be necessary\r\nto remove a part, or the whole of the udder.\r\n\r\nThe giving of milk discolored with blood may be treated by applying\r\ncamphorated ointment twice daily.\r\n\r\nSORE AND WARTY TEATS.--Irritation to the teats by filth, cold, moisture and\r\ninjuries cause the skin to become inflamed, sore and scabby.\r\n\r\n_Preventive treatment_ is the most satisfactory. Sore teats may be treated\r\nby applying the following ointment after each milking: vaseline ten parts\r\nand oxide of zinc one part. Pendulous warts may be clipped off with a sharp\r\npair of scissors. Castor oil applied to the wart daily by rubbing may be\r\nused for the removal of flat warts.\r\n\r\n\"MILK-FEVER\" OR POST-PARTUM PARALYSIS.--This is a disease peculiar to cows,\r\nespecially heavy milkers that are in good condition. It most commonly\r\noccurs after the third, fourth and fifth calving. The disease usually\r\nappears within the first two or three days after calving, but it has been\r\nknown to occur before, and as late as several weeks after calving. The\r\ncause is not certainly known. The Schmidt theory is that certain toxins are\r\nformed in the udder, owing to the over activity of the cells of the\r\nglandular tissue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--A case of milk-fever.]\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are characteristic of the disease. At the very beginning of\r\nthe attack the cow stops eating and ruminating, becomes uneasy, switches\r\nthe tail, stamps the feet, trembles, staggers when forced to walk and\r\nfinally falls and is unable to get up. At first she may lie in a natural\r\nposition; later, as the paralytic symptoms become more pronounced, the head\r\nis laid against the side of the body and the animal seems to be in a deep\r\nsleep (Fig. 20). In the more severe form the cow lies on her side,\r\nconsciousness is lost and the paralysis of the muscles is marked. The\r\ndifferent body functions are interfered with; the urine is retained,\r\nbloating occurs, respirations are slow, pulse weak and temperature\r\nsubnormal or normal.\r\n\r\n_Preventive treatment_, such as feeding a spare diet during the latter\r\nperiod of pregnancy, is not always advisable. Heavy milkers should be given\r\none-half pound of Glauber's salts a day or two before calving, and the dose\r\nrepeated when the cow becomes fresh. Cows affected with milk-fever seldom\r\ndie if treated promptly.\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ consists in emptying the udder by milking and injecting air\r\nor oxygen gas into the gland until it is completely distended (Fig. 21).\r\nThe milk-fever apparatus should be clean, and the air injected filtered.\r\nBefore introducing the milking tube into the milk duct, the udder should\r\nfirst be washed with a disinfectant, and a clean towel laid on the floor\r\nfor the gland to rest on. After injecting the quarter, strips of muslin or\r\ntape should be tied around the ends of the teats to prevent the escape of\r\nthe air. If the cow does not show indications of recovery in from four to\r\nfive hours, the treatment should be repeated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Milk-fever apparatus: pump; filter; rubber tubing;\r\nand milk tube.]\r\n\r\nIt is very necessary to give the cow a comfortable stall and protect her\r\nfrom any kind of exposure. No bulky drenches should be administered. If she\r\nlies stretched out, the fore parts should be raised by packing straw under\r\nher. This is necessary in order to prevent pneumonia, caused by\r\nregurgitated feed entering the air passages and lungs. It is very advisable\r\nto give her the following mixture for a few days after the attack: tincture\r\nof nux vomica two ounces, and alcohol six ounces. One ounce of this mixture\r\nmay be given four times daily in a little water.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n 1. Name the generative organs of the female.\r\n\r\n 2.

The anterior group, the\r\n_nostrils, nasal cavities, pharynx, larynx_ and _trachea_, is situated in\r\nthe region of the head and neck. The posterior group, the _bronchial tubes_\r\nand _lungs_, is situated in the chest or thoracic cavity.\r\n\r\n_The nostrils_ are the anterior openings of the air passages. The nasal\r\ncavities are situated in the anterior region of the head, and extend the\r\nentire length of the face. Each cavity is divided into three long, narrow\r\npassages by the two pairs of turbinated bones. The lining membrane is the\r\nnasal mucous membrane, the lower two-thirds or respiratory portion\r\ndiffering from the upper one-third, in that the latter possesses the nerve\r\nendings of the olfactory nerve and is the seat of smell. The five pairs of\r\nhead sinuses communicate with the nasal cavities. Posteriorly and near the\r\nsuperior extremity of the nasal passages, are two large openings, the\r\nguttural, that open into the pharyngeal cavity.\r\n\r\n_The pharynx_ is a somewhat funnel-shaped cavity. The walls are thin and\r\nformed by muscles and mucous membrane. This is the cross-road between the\r\ndigestive and respiratory passages. In the posterior portion of the cavity\r\nthere are two openings. The inferior opening leads to the larynx and the\r\nsuperior one to the oesophagus. All feed on its way to the stomach must\r\npass over the opening into the larynx. It is impossible, however, for the\r\nfeed to enter this opening, unless accidentally when the animal coughs. The\r\ncartilage closing this opening is pressed shut by the base of the tongue\r\nwhen the bolus of feed is passed back and into the oesophageal opening.\r\n\r\n_The larynx_ may be compared to a box open at both ends. The several\r\ncartilages that form it are united by ligaments. It is lined by a mucous\r\nmembrane. The posterior extremity is united to the first cartilaginous ring\r\nof the trachea. The anterior opening is closed by the epiglottis. Just\r\nwithin is a V-shaped opening that is limited laterally by the folds of the\r\nlaryngeal mucous membrane, the vocal chords.\r\n\r\n_The trachea_ is a cylindrical tube originating at the posterior extremity\r\nof the larynx, and terminating within the chest cavity at a point just\r\nabove the heart in the right and left bronchial tubes. It is formed by a\r\nseries of cartilaginous rings joined together at their borders by ligaments\r\nand lined by a mucous membrane.\r\n\r\n_The bronchial tubes_ resemble the trachea in structure. They enter the\r\nlungs a short distance from their origin, where they subdivide into\r\nbranches and sub-branches, gradually decreasing in calibre and losing the\r\ncartilaginous rings, ligaments and muscular layer until only the thin\r\nmucous membrane is left. They become capillary in diameter, and finally\r\nopen into the infundibula of the air cells of the lungs.\r\n\r\n_The lungs_ take up all of the space in the thoracic cavity not occupied by\r\nthe heart, blood-vessels and oesophagus. This cavity resembles a cone in\r\nshape that is cut obliquely downwards and forward at its base. The base is\r\nformed by the diaphragm which is pushed forward at its middle. It is lined\r\nby the pleura, a serous membrane, that is inflected from the wall over the\r\ndifferent organs within the cavity. The median folds of the pleura divide\r\nthe cavity into right and left portions. A second method of describing the\r\narrangement of the pleura is to state that it forms two sacks, right and\r\nleft, that enclose the lungs. The lungs are the essential organs of\r\nrespiration. The tissue that forms them is light, will float in water, is\r\nelastic and somewhat rose-colored. Each lung is divided into lobes, and\r\neach lobe into a great number of lobules by the supporting connective\r\ntissue. The lobule is the smallest division of the lung and is formed by\r\ncapillary bronchial tubes, air cells and blood-vessels. It is here that the\r\nexternal respiration or the exchange of gases between the capillaries and\r\nthe air cells occurs.\r\n\r\nVENTILATION.--It is agreed by all persons who have investigated the\r\nsubject, that unventilated stable air is injurious to animals. At one time\r\nit was believed that the injurious effects resulting from the breathing of\r\nair charged with gases and moisture from the expired air and the animal's\r\nsurroundings, were due to a deficiency in oxygen. It is now believed that\r\nthe ill-effects are mainly due to the stagnation of air, the humid\r\natmosphere, and the irritating gases emanating from the body excretions.\r\n\r\nThe common impurities found in _stable air_ are carbonic and ammonia gas,\r\nmoisture charged with injurious matter and dust from the floor and bodies\r\nof the animals. As a rule, the more crowded and filthy the stable, the more\r\nimpurities there are in the air. If any of the animals are affected with an\r\ninfectious disease, such as tuberculosis or glanders, the moisture and dust\r\nmay act as carriers of the disease-producing germs. Infectious diseases\r\nspread rapidly in crowded, poorly ventilated stables. The two factors\r\nresponsible for this rapid spread of disease are the lowered vitality of\r\nthe animal, due to breathing the vitiated air, and the greater opportunity\r\nfor infection, because of the comparatively large number of bacteria\r\npresent in the air.\r\n\r\n_The purpose of stable ventilation_ is to replace the stable air with purer\r\nair. The frequency with which the air in the stable should be changed\r\ndepends on the cubic feet of air space provided for each animal, and the\r\nsanitary conditions present. The principal factor in stable ventilation is\r\nthe force of the wind. In cold weather it is very difficult to properly\r\nventilate a crowded stable without too much loss of animal heat and\r\ncreating draughts.\r\n\r\nFor practical purposes, the _need of ventilation_ in a stable can be\r\ndetermined by the odor of the air, the amount of moisture present and the\r\ntemperature. It is impossible to keep the air within the stable as pure as\r\nthe atmosphere outside.\r\n\r\nAll dangers from injury by breathing impure air, or by draughts can be\r\neliminated by proper stable construction, attention to the ventilation and\r\nkeeping the quarters clean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--A case of catarrhal cold.]\r\n\r\nCATARRH (COLD IN THE HEAD).--Catarrh is an inflammation of the mucous\r\nmembrane lining the nasal cavities that usually extends to the membrane\r\nlining of the sinuses of the head. It may be acute or chronic. The\r\ninflammation very often extends to the pharynx and larynx. Cold in the head\r\nis more common in the horse than in any of the other animals (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n_The most common causes_ of \"colds\" are standing or lying in a draught,\r\nbecoming wet, and exposure to the cold. \"Colds\" are common during cold,\r\nchangeable weather. Horses that are accustomed to warm stables, are very\r\napt to take \"cold\" if changed to a cold stable and not protected with a\r\nblanket. Most animals are not affected by the cold weather if given dry\r\nquarters and a dry bed. Irritation to the mucous membrane by dust, gases\r\nand germs is a common cause. Influenza and colt distemper are characterized\r\nby an inflammation of the respiratory mucous membranes. In the horse,\r\nchronic catarrh is commonly caused by diseased teeth, and injuries to the\r\nwall of the maxillary sinus. In sheep, the larvae of the bot-fly may cause\r\ncatarrh.\r\n\r\n_The early symptoms_ usually pass unnoticed by the attendant. The lining\r\nmembrane of the nostrils is at first dry and red. During this stage\r\nsneezing is common. In a few days a discharge appears. This is watery at\r\nfirst, but may become catarrhal, heavy, mucous-like and turbid. In severe\r\ncases it resembles pus. The lining membrane of the eyelids appears red and\r\ntears may flow from the eye. Sometimes the animal acts dull and feverish,\r\nbut this symptom does not last longer than one or two days unless\r\ncomplicated by sore throat.\r\n\r\n_Inflammation of the throat_ is a common complication of \"colds.\" It is\r\ncharacterized by difficulty in swallowing and partial, or complete loss of\r\nappetite. Drinking or exercising causes the animal to cough. If the larynx\r\nas well as the pharynx is inflamed, distressed and noisy breathing may\r\noccur. Pressure over the region of the throat causes the animal pain.\r\n\r\nCommon \"cold\" terminates favorably within a week. Chronic catarrh may\r\npersist until the cause is removed and the necessary local treatment\r\napplied. Inflammation of the pharynx and larynx may persist for several\r\nweeks unless properly treated. Abscesses may form in the region of the\r\nthroat. Horses frequently become thick winded as a result of severe attacks\r\nof sore throat.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. \"Colds\" and sore throat\r\ncan be largely prevented by good care, exercise and properly ventilated\r\nstables. Mild cases require a light diet, comfortable quarters and a dry\r\nbed. Allowing the animal to inhale steam three or four times daily is\r\nuseful in relieving the inflammation. Easily digested feeds, and in case\r\nthe animal has difficulty in swallowing, soft feeds and gruels, should be\r\ngiven. The throat may be kept covered with a layer of antiphlogistin and\r\nbandaged. Glycoheroin may be given in from teaspoonful to tablespoonful\r\ndoses, depending on the size of the animal. Chlorate of potassium may be\r\ngiven in the drinking water.\r\n\r\nIf the animal becomes run down in flesh, as sometimes occurs in chronic\r\ncatarrh, bitter tonics should be given. In the latter disease, it is\r\nsometimes necessary to trephine and wash out the sinus or sinuses affected\r\nwith an antiseptic solution. It may be necessary to continue this treatment\r\nfor several weeks.\r\n\r\nBRONCHITIS.--Inflammation of the bronchial tubes may be either acute or\r\nchronic. Acute bronchitis is especially common in the horse, while the\r\nchronic form is more often met with in the smaller animals, especially\r\nhogs. This disease is most common among horses during the changeable\r\nseasons of the years. It is _caused_ by warm, close stables or stalls, and\r\nirritating gases emanating from the floor, or manure in the stall. In\r\ngeneral, the causes are about the same as in cold in the head. In young\r\nanimals and hogs, the inhalation of dust, and bronchial and lung worms\r\ncommonly cause it. Verminous bronchitis usually becomes chronic.\r\n\r\n_In the acute form_ of the disease the _symptoms_ come on very quickly, the\r\nfever is high and the pulse beats and respirations are rapid. Chilling of\r\nthe body occurs, and the animal may appear dull and refuse to eat. The\r\nanimal coughs frequently. Recovery occurs within a few days, unless\r\ncomplicated by sore throat and pneumonia. In the horse, bronchitis is not a\r\nserious disease, but in other animals recovery is delayed and complications\r\nare more common.\r\n\r\n_In chronic bronchitis_ in the horse, the animal coughs frequently, there\r\nis more or less discharge from the nostrils and the respirations may become\r\nlabored when exercised. The animal is usually weak, in poor flesh and unfit\r\nfor work. In other cases, symptoms of broken wind are noticed. Severe\r\ncoughing spells on getting up from the bed, or on moving about are\r\ncharacteristic of bronchitis in hogs. Verminous bronchitis in calves and\r\nlambs is characterized by severe spells of coughing, difficult and labored\r\nbreathing and a weak, emaciated condition.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ is the same as for \"colds.\" In the acute form\r\nthe treatment consists largely in careful nursing. Properly ventilated,\r\nclean quarters that are free from dust should be provided. The animal\r\nshould be covered with a light or heavy blanket, depending on the\r\ntemperature of the stable, and the limbs bandaged. A light diet should be\r\nfed for a few days. It is advisable to give the animal a physic of oil. The\r\ninhalation of steam every few hours during the first few days should be\r\npractised. Glycoheroin may be given three or four times a day.\r\n\r\nAnimals affected with chronic bronchitis should not be exercised or worked.\r\nWe should guard against their taking cold, give nourishing feeds, and a\r\ntonic if necessary.\r\n\r\nCONGESTION OF THE LUNGS.--Pulmonary congestion is generally due to\r\noverexertion and exposure to extreme heat or cold. It may occur if the\r\nanimal is exercised when sick or exhausted. Hogs that are heated from\r\nexercise and allowed access to cold water, may suffer from a congestion or\r\nengorgement of the lungs. It may be present at the beginning of an attack\r\nof pneumonia or pleurisy.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are difficult breathing and the animal fights for its\r\nbreath. The body temperature may be several degrees above the normal. In\r\nthe mild form, the above symptoms are not so marked. The onset and course\r\nof the disease are rapid, recovery, pneumonia, or death often occurring\r\nwithin twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n_Pulmonary haemorrhage_ is not uncommon. The discharge from the nostrils\r\nmay be slightly tinged with blood, or there may be an intermittent\r\ndischarge of blood from the nostrils or mouth. The mucous membranes are\r\npale, the animal trembles and shows marked dyspnoea.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in using the proper judgment in caring\r\nfor, and in working or exercising animals. This is especially true if the\r\nanimal is affected with acute or chronic disease. At the very beginning,\r\nbleeding should be practised. Hot blankets renewed frequently and bandages\r\nto the limbs is a very necessary part of the treatment. In case of severe\r\npulmonary haemorrhage, treatment is of little use.\r\n\r\nPNEUMONIA.--Inflammation of the lungs is more common in horses than in any\r\nof the other domestic animals. The croupous form is the most common. The\r\ninflammation may affect one or both lungs, one or more lobes, or scattered\r\nlobules of lung tissue. The inflammation may be acute, subacute or chronic.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ are very much the same as in other respiratory diseases.\r\nExposure to cold and wet, stable draughts, becoming chilled after\r\nperspiring freely and washing the animal with cold water are the common\r\ncauses of pneumonia. Inflammation of the lungs is especially apt to occur\r\nif the animal is not accustomed to such exposure. Animals affected with\r\nother respiratory diseases are predisposed to pneumonia. Drenching animals\r\nby way of the nostril and irritating drenches, or regurgitated feed passing\r\ninto the air passages and lungs are the traumatic causes of pneumonia.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ vary in the different forms of pneumonia. In case pneumonia\r\noccurs secondarily, the earliest symptoms are confounded with those of the\r\nprimary disease. The first symptoms noticed may be a high body temperature,\r\nas indicated by chills, and refusing to eat. The visible mucous membranes\r\nare red and congested, the nostrils dilated, the respirations quickened and\r\ndifficult, the expired air hot and the pulse beats accelerated. The animal\r\ncoughs, and in the horse, a rusty discharge may be noticed adhering to the\r\nmargins of the nostrils. The horse refuses to lie down if both lungs are\r\ninflamed. In severe cases the expression of the face indicates pain, the\r\nrespirations are labored, the general symptoms aggravated, and the animal\r\nstands with the front feet spread apart. Cattle are inclined to lie down,\r\nunless the lungs are seriously affected. Hogs like to burrow under the\r\nlitter.\r\n\r\n_The course of croupous pneumonia_ is typical, and unless it terminates\r\nfatally in the first stage, the periods of congestion, hepatization and\r\nresolution follow each other in regular manner. Auscultation of the lungs\r\nis of great value in diagnosing and watching the progress of the disease.\r\nIt is more difficult to determine the character of the lung sounds in the\r\nhorse and cow than it is in the small animals. This is especially difficult\r\nif the animal is fat. During the period of _congestion_ which lasts about a\r\nday, one can hear both healthy and crepitating sounds. The period of\r\n_hepatization_ is characterized by an absence of sound over the diseased\r\narea. The inflammatory exudates become organized at the beginning of this\r\nstage, and the air can not enter the air cells. This period lasts several\r\ndays. _Resolution_ marks the beginning of recovery or convalescence. Toward\r\nthe end of the second period, the inflammatory exudate in the air cells has\r\nbegun to degenerate. In the last stage, these exudates undergo liquefaction\r\nand are absorbed, or expelled by coughing, in from seven days to two weeks,\r\ndepending on the extent of the inflammation and the general condition of\r\nthe animal.\r\n\r\n_In the subacute form_ the symptoms are mild and may subside within a week.\r\nSometimes _abscesses_ form in the lung. _Gangrenous inflammation_ of the\r\nlung can be recognized by the odor of the expired air and the severity of\r\nthe symptoms. This form of pneumonia terminates fatally. If the larger\r\nportion of the lung tissue is inflamed, death from asphyxia may occur in\r\nthe second stage.\r\n\r\nThe success in the _treatment_ of pneumonia depends largely on the care.\r\nProperly ventilated, clean, comfortable quarters and careful nursing are\r\nhighly important. Large animals should be given a roomy box stall. Cold\r\ndoes not aggravate pneumonia, providing the animal's body is well protected\r\nwith blankets and the limbs bandaged. Wet, damp quarters and draughts are\r\ninjurious. Hogs should be given plenty of bedding to burrow in. A light,\r\neasily digested diet should be fed. Very little roughage should be fed. If\r\nthe animal does not eat well, it may be given eggs and milk. Weak pulse\r\nbeats should be treated by giving digitalis and strychnine.\r\nCounterirritation to the chest wall is indicated. During convalescence,\r\nbitter tonics may be given. Constipation should be treated by giving the\r\nanimal castor or linseed oil.\r\n\r\nPLEURISY.--Inflammation of the pleura is most common in horses. It occurs\r\nin all farm animals and is frequently unilateral. There are two forms of\r\npleurisy, acute and chronic. Pleuropneumonia is common when the cause is a\r\nspecific germ. This occurs in tuberculosis, pleuropneumonia of horses and\r\npneumococcus infection.\r\n\r\n_The common causes_ are exposure to cold, chilling winds, draughty, damp\r\nquarters, and drinking cold water when perspiring. Injuries to the costal\r\npleura by fractured ribs and punctured wounds may cause it to become\r\ninflamed.\r\n\r\nThe early symptoms of acute pleurisy are chills, rise in body temperature,\r\npain and abdominal breathing. The most characteristic symptom is the ridge\r\nextending along the lower extremities of the ribs (pleuritic ridge). The\r\nanimal does not stand still as in pneumonia, but changes its position\r\noccasionally, its movements in many cases being accompanied by a grunt.\r\nPressure on the wall of the chest causes the animal to flinch and show\r\nevidence of severe pain. Large animals rarely lie down. The cough is short\r\nand painful. On placing the ear against the wall of the chest and listening\r\nto the respirations, we are able to hear friction sounds. After a few days\r\neffusion occurs in the pleural cavity. Although the animal may have refused\r\nto eat up to this time, it now appears greatly relieved and may offer to\r\neat its feed. This relief may be only temporary. If the fluid exudate forms\r\nin sufficient quantity to cause pressure on the heart and lungs and\r\ninterfere with their movement, the pulse beat is weak, the respirations\r\nquick and labored, the elbows are turned out and the feet are spread apart.\r\nAll of the respiratory muscles may be used. The expression of the face may\r\nindicate threatened asphyxia. We may determine the extent of the pleural\r\nexudate by auscultation. There is no evidence of respiratory sounds in that\r\nportion of the chest below the surface of the fluid. Dropsical swellings\r\nmay occur on the under surface of the breast and abdomen.\r\n\r\n_In subacute cases_ evidence of recovery is noted in from four to ten days.\r\n_Acute pleurisy_ very often terminates fatally. Under the most favorable\r\nconditions, recovery takes place very slowly, sometimes extending over a\r\nperiod of several months. It is not uncommon for the horse to continue\r\nhaving \"defective wind.\"\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in good care, well ventilated quarters and careful\r\nnursing, the same as recommended in the treatment of pneumonia. At the very\r\nbeginning, the pain may be relieved by the administration of small doses of\r\nmorphine. If the conditions in the stable permit, a hot blanket that has\r\nbeen dipped in hot water and wrung out as dry as possible, may be applied\r\nto the chest wall and covered with a rubber blanket. This treatment should\r\nbe continued during the first few days of the inflammation. These\r\napplications may be reinforced by occasionally applying mustard paste to\r\nthe sides of the chest.\r\n\r\nThe animal should be allowed to drink but a limited amount of water. The\r\nfeed must be highly nutritious. Milk and eggs should be given if necessary.\r\nA laxative dose of oil should be given. Calomel, aloes, and digitalis are\r\nrecommended when the effusion period approaches in order to increase the\r\nelimination of fluid, and lessen its entrance into the body cavity. If the\r\namount of effusion is large, puncture of the thoracic cavity with a trocar\r\nand cannula may be practised. This operation should be performed carefully,\r\nand all possible precautions used against infection of the wound. During\r\nthe later period of the disease iodide of potassium, iron and bitter tonics\r\nshould be given.\r\n\r\nBROKEN-WIND, HEAVES.--The terms broken-wind and heaves are used in a way to\r\ninclude a number of different diseases of the respiratory organs of the\r\nhorse. The term heaves is applied almost wholly to an emphysematous\r\ncondition of the lungs. Broken-wind may include the following diseased\r\nconditions: obstruction of the nasal passages by bony enlargements and\r\ntumors; tumors in the pharynx; enlarged neck glands; collection of pus in\r\nthe guttural pouches and paralysis of the left, or both recurrent nerves\r\n(roaring).\r\n\r\n_The common causes_ of heaves are pre-existing diseases of the respiratory\r\norgans, severe exercise when the animal is not in condition and wrong\r\nmethods of feeding. Heaves is more common in horses that are fed heavily on\r\ndusty timothy and clover hay and allowed to drink large quantities of water\r\nafter feeding, than in horses that are fed green feeds, graze on pastures\r\nor receive prairie hay for roughage. Chronic indigestion seems to aggravate\r\nthe disease. Over-distention of the stomach and intestines due to feeding\r\ntoo much roughage and grain interferes with respiration. Severe exercise\r\nwhen in this condition may result in over-distention, dilation and rupture\r\nof the air cells. This is the most common structural change met with in the\r\nlungs of horses affected with heaves. It is termed emphysema.\r\n\r\n_The common symptoms_ noted are the double contraction of the muscles of\r\nthe flank with each expiration, a short, dry cough and the dilated\r\nnostrils. The frequent passage of gas is a prominent symptom in\r\nwell-established cases of heaves. Chronic indigestion is commonly present\r\nin heavy horses that are not well cared for, or are given hard work. This\r\ncondition aggravates the distressed breathing.\r\n\r\nHeaves is a permanent disorder, but it may be relieved by climatic changes\r\nand careful attention to the animal's diet.\r\n\r\nThe following _preventive treatment_ is recommended: Dusty hay should not\r\nbe fed to horses. Clover hay is not a safe feed for horses that are worked\r\nhard. When starting on a drive after feeding, the horse should not be\r\ndriven fast, but allowed to go slowly for a few miles.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms can be greatly relieved by careful attention to the diet. A\r\nlimited quantity of roughage should be fed, and this should be good in\r\nquality and fed in the evening. During the warm weather, the animal should\r\nbe watered frequently. After quitting work in the evening the animal may be\r\nallowed to drink as much water as it wants. Plenty of grain, soft feed and\r\nroots may be fed. A small handful of flaxseed meal given with the feed\r\nhelps in keeping down constipation. Fowler's solution of arsenic may be\r\ngiven twice daily with the feed, in half-ounce doses for a period of ten\r\ndays or two weeks. Chronic indigestion should be combated by digestive\r\ntonics.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Name the organs that form the anterior and posterior air passages.\r\n\r\n2. To what conditions are the injurious effects of keeping animals in a\r\n   poorly ventilated stable due?\r\n\r\n3. State the purpose of ventilation.

State the cause of bronchitis; give the treatment.\r\n\r\n6. What are the causes of pneumonia? Describe the symptoms and treatment.\r\n\r\n7. What symptoms are characteristic of pleurisy? Give the treatment for\r\n   pleurisy.\r\n\r\n8. Give the causes and treatment of \"heaves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE CIRCULATORY ORGANS\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION.--The circulatory organs are the heart, arteries, veins\r\nand lymphatics. The _heart_ is the central organ of the circulatory system\r\n(Fig. 23). Its function is to force the blood through the blood-vessels. It\r\nis situated in the thoracic cavity between the lungs, and enclosed by a\r\nspecial fold of the pleura, the pericardial sack. There are two kinds of\r\nblood-vessels, arteries and veins. The _arteries_ leave the heart and carry\r\nthe blood to the many different organs of the body. The _veins_ return to\r\nthe heart and carry the blood from the body tissues. The _capillaries_ are\r\nsmall blood-vessels, microscopic in size, that connect the arteries with\r\nthe veins. The arteries carry the pure blood. The opposite is true,\r\nhowever, of the lesser or pulmonary system. The pulmonary artery carries\r\nthe impure blood to the lungs, and the pulmonary veins carry the pure blood\r\nback from the lungs. The _lymphatic vessels_ carry a transparent or\r\nslightly colored fluid and chyle from the tissues and alimentary canal.\r\nThis system of vessels empties into the venous system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Photograph of model of horse's heart: auricle;\r\nventricle; pulmonary artery; pulmonary veins; posterior aorta; and anterior\r\naorta.]\r\n\r\n_The functions of the blood_ are to nourish the body tissues; furnish\r\nmaterial for the purpose of the body secretions; supply the cells of the\r\nbody with oxygen; convey from the tissues injurious substances produced by\r\nthe cellular activity; and destroy organisms that may have entered the body\r\ntissues. The cellular and fluid portions of the blood are not always\r\ndestructive to disease-producing organisms. In certain infectious diseases,\r\nthe fluid portion of the blood may contain innumerable organisms, and\r\ndestruction of the blood cells occurs.\r\n\r\n_In inflammation_ of tissue the circulation of the blood in the inflamed\r\npart undergoes certain characteristic changes. At the beginning there is an\r\nincrease in the blood going to the part. This is followed by a slowing of\r\nthe blood stream in the small vessels, and the collecting of the blood\r\ncells in the capillaries and veins. These circulatory changes are followed\r\nby the migration of the blood cells, and the escape of the fluid portion of\r\nthe blood into the surrounding tissue. The character of the above\r\ncirculatory changes depends on the extent of the injury to the tissue.\r\n\r\nPALPITATION.--This disturbance in domestic animals seems to be purely\r\nfunctional. It may occur independent of any organic heart disease. A highly\r\nnervous condition, excitement, over-exertion, debility from disease and the\r\nfeeding of an improper ration are the common causes.\r\n\r\nThe heart beats are so violent and tumultuous as to shake the body, and be\r\nnoticed when standing near the animal. The heart sounds are louder than\r\nnormal and the pulse beats small and irregular. It may be differentiated\r\nfrom spasm of the diaphragm by determining the relationship of the heart\r\nbeats to the abrupt shocks observed in the costal and flank regions.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in keeping the animal quiet and avoiding any\r\nexcitement. A quiet stall away from the other animals is best. The\r\ntreatment of palpitation resulting from some organic heart disease must be\r\ndirected largely at the original disease. Morphine is commonly used for the\r\ntreatment of this disorder. Weak, anaemic animals should receive blood and\r\nbitter tonics. If we have reason to believe that the disturbance is caused\r\nby improper feeding, the animal should receive a spare diet for a few days.\r\nIn such cases it is advisable to administer a physic.\r\n\r\nPERICARDITIS.--Inflammation of the pericardial sack is usually a secondary\r\ndisease. It is frequently met with in influenza, contagious\r\npleuropneumonia, hog-cholera and rheumatism. Cattle may suffer from\r\ntraumatic pericarditis caused by sharp, pointed, foreign bodies passing\r\nthrough the wall of the reticulum and penetrating the pericardial sack. The\r\njagged ends of fractured ribs may cause extensive injury to neighboring\r\nparts, and the inflammation spreads to the pericardial sack.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ of pericarditis may not be recognized at the very beginning\r\nwhen the disease occurs as a complication of influenza, or infectious\r\npleuropneumonia. The manifestation of pain by moving about in the stall,\r\nrefusing to eat and the anxious expression of the face are the first\r\nsymptoms that the attendant may notice. The body temperature is higher than\r\nnormal, and the pulse rapid and irregular. On auscultation, friction sounds\r\nthat correspond to the tumultuous beats of the heart are heard. When fluid\r\ncollects within the pericardial sack, the heart beats become feeble and the\r\npulse weak. Labored breathing and bluish discoloration of the lips follow.\r\nThe disease usually runs a very acute course. The prognosis is unfavorable.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ recommended in pneumonia is indicated in this disease.\r\nAbsolute rest and the feeding of an easily digested, laxative diet is a\r\nvery essential part of the treatment. At the very beginning morphine may be\r\ngiven to quiet the tumultuous beats of the heart. Cold applications to the\r\nchest wall in the form of ice packs should be used. Heart tonics and\r\nstimulants such as digitalis, strychnine and alcohol should be administered\r\nwhen the pulse beats weaken. To promote absorption of the exudate, iodide\r\nof sodium may be given. Mustard paste, or a cantharides blister applied\r\nover the region of the heart is useful in easing the pain and overcoming\r\nthe inflammation. If fluid collects in sufficient quantity to seriously\r\ninterfere with the heart action, the sack may be punctured with the trocar\r\nand cannula and the fluid withdrawn. Great care must be used to avoid\r\ninjury to the heart and infection of the part.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--Elephantiasis in horse.]\r\n\r\nACUTE LYMPHANGITIS.--This is an inflammation of the lymphatic vessels of\r\none or both hind limbs. The attack comes on suddenly and usually occurs in\r\nconnection with rest, and in horses that are of slow, quiet temperament.\r\nThe _exciting cause_ is an infection of the part with bacteria, the\r\ninfection probably occurring through some abrasion or small wound in the\r\nskin.\r\n\r\n_The local symptoms_ are swelling, tenderness and lameness in the affected\r\nlimb. The animal may refuse to support its weight on the affected limb. The\r\nlymphatic glands in the region are swollen, and the swelling of the limb\r\npits on pressure. In the chronic form of the disease, the regions of the\r\ncannon and foot remain permanently enlarged, and the swelling is more firm\r\nthan it is in the acute form (Fig. 24).\r\n\r\n_The general symptoms_ are high body temperature, rapid pulse and the\r\npartial or complete loss of appetite.\r\n\r\n_The following treatment_ is recommended: Exercise is indicated in cases\r\nthat are not sufficiently advanced to cause severe lameness, or inability\r\nto use the limb; rest and the application of woollen bandages wrung out of\r\na hot water solution of liquor cresolis compound are recommended; Epsom\r\nsalts in one-half pound doses may be given and repeated in two or three\r\ndays; a very light diet of soft feed should be given; liniments should\r\n_not_ be applied until the soreness in the limb has subsided; iodide of\r\npotassium may be given twice daily with the feed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. What are the functions of the blood and lymph?\r\n\r\n2. State the changes occurring in the circulation in inflamed tissue.\r\n\r\n3. What is palpitation? Give the causes and treatment.\r\n\r\n4. What are the common causes of pericarditis?\r\n\r\n5. Give the causes and treatment of acute lymphangitis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION.--The nervous system may be divided into central and\r\nperipheral portions. The _central portion_ comprises the brain or\r\nencephalon and the spinal cord. These organs are lodged in the cranial\r\ncavity and spinal canal. The nerves and ganglia comprise the _peripheral\r\nportion_. The nerves form white cords that are made up of nerve fibres. The\r\nganglia are grayish enlargements formed by nerve cells and supporting\r\ntissue, situated at the origin of the nerve trunk or along its course.\r\n\r\n_The brain_ is an oval mass of nerve tissue elongated from before to\r\nbehind, and slightly depressed from above to below. It terminates\r\nposteriorly in the spinal cord. It is divided into three portions:\r\n_cerebrum, isthmus_ and _cerebellum_ (Fig. 25).\r\n\r\n_The cerebrum_ forms the anterior portion. It is divided into two lateral\r\nlobes or hemispheres by a deep longitudinal fissure. The surface of the\r\ncerebral hemispheres is gray and roughened by pleats or folds separated by\r\ngrooves or fissures. The gray or cortical layer is distinct from the white\r\nor connecting structure. The cortical layer is made up of nerve cells or\r\nareas which control the voluntary muscles of the body. It is connected with\r\nthe special senses of touch, temperature and muscle-sense. The gray layer\r\nis connected with the posterior portion of the brain, the isthmus or\r\nmedulla oblongata, by the white nerve tissue.\r\n\r\n_The isthmus_ or _medulla oblongata_ is elongated from before to behind and\r\nconnects the cerebral hemispheres with the spinal cord, anteriorly and\r\nposteriorly. It is divided into several different portions, and is made up\r\nlargely of white connecting fibres with nuclei of gray matter scattered\r\nthrough them. The isthmus is hollowed out by a system of small ventricles\r\nthat extend from the cerebral hemispheres to the spinal cord, where they\r\nterminate in a small, central canal. The isthmus is the highway between the\r\nspinal cord and the higher nerve centres. It has in it certain cell centres\r\nthat give origin to six of the cranial nerves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Photograph of model of horse's brain: longitudinal\r\nsection; lateral view; cerebrum; cerebellum; and isthmus.]\r\n\r\nThe third division of the brain is the _cerebellum_. This is a single mass\r\nsupported by the isthmus. It is situated posterior to the cerebrum, from\r\nwhich it is separated by a transverse fold of the membranes covering the\r\nbrain. This mass of nerve tissue is much smaller than the cerebrum. The\r\nwhite nerve tissue forms central nuclei which send out branches that ramify\r\nin every direction. The centre of the muscular sense is said to be located\r\nin this division of the brain. A second function is the maintenance of body\r\nequilibrium through its connection with the nerve of the middle ear.\r\n\r\n_The spinal cord_ commences at the posterior opening (occipital foramen) of\r\nthe cranial cavity, and terminates posteriorly in the lumbar region at the\r\nupper third of that portion of the spinal canal belonging to the sacrum. It\r\nis thick, white in color, irregularly cylindrical in shape, slightly\r\nflattened above and below and reaches its largest diameter in the lower\r\ncervical and lumbar regions. The spinal canal is lined by the outer\r\nmembrane that envelops the cord, which aids in fixing this organ to the\r\nwall of the canal. The spinal cord is formed by white and gray nerve\r\ntissue. The gray tissue is situated within the white, and it is arranged in\r\nthe form of two lateral comma-shaped columns connected by a narrow\r\ncommissure of gray matter. The extremities of the lateral gray columns mark\r\nthe origin of the superior and inferior roots of the spinal nerves. The\r\nwhite tissue of the cord is also divided into lateral portions by superior\r\nand median fissures. The inferior fissure does not extend as far as the\r\ngray commissure, leaving the lateral inferior columns connected by a white\r\ncommissure. There are certain centres in the spinal cord that are capable\r\nof carrying on certain reflex actions independent of the chief centre in\r\nthe brain. The white matter of the cord is made up of paths over which\r\nimpulses to and from the brain are transmitted.\r\n\r\n_There are twelve pairs of cranial nerves_. Two pairs belong exclusively to\r\nthe special senses, smell and sight. Altogether there are ten pairs that\r\nare devoted to functions connected with the head, either as nerves of the\r\nspecial senses or in a motor or sensory capacity (Figs. 26 and 27). There\r\nare two pairs distributed to other regions. These are the tenth and\r\neleventh pairs. The tenth pair or pneumogastric is distributed to the vital\r\norgans lodged within the body cavities.\r\n\r\nThere are forty-two or forty-three pairs of spinal nerves given off from\r\nthe spinal cord. The spinal nerves have two roots, superior and inferior.\r\nThe superior is the sensory root and the inferior is the motor root, both\r\nuniting to form a mixed nerve trunk. The sensory root possesses a ganglion\r\nfrom which it originates.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the cerebrospinal system deals with the special senses,\r\nmovement of skeletal or voluntary muscles and cutaneous and muscular\r\nsensations. In addition to the above there is a distinct system termed the\r\nsympathetic. The _sympathetic system_ consists of a long cord, studded with\r\nganglia, extending from the base of the neck to the sacrum. The ganglia are\r\nconnected with the inferior roots of the spinal nerves. This cord is\r\nconnected with groups of ganglia and nerve fibres in the abdominal region,\r\nand this in turn is connected with terminal ganglia in distant tissues.\r\nThis system of nerves is distributed to the vital organs of the body.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Unilateral facial paralysis caused by injury to\r\nseventh cranial nerve; note position of lip.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Bilateral facial paralysis. This colt was affected\r\nwith facial paralysis when born.]\r\n\r\nCONGESTION AND ANAEMIA OF THE BRAIN.--In congestion of the brain, the\r\nblood-vessels distributed to the nerve tissue become engorged with blood.\r\nIt may be either active or passive.\r\n\r\n_The cause of anaemia_ of the brain is an insufficient blood supply. This\r\nmay be due to an abundant haemorrhage and cardiac weakness caused by shock\r\nor organic heart disease.\r\n\r\n_The causes of congestion_ of the brain are faulty methods of care and\r\nfeeding. It sometimes occurs when horses are shipped in poorly ventilated\r\ncars, or kept in close stables. Climatic changes, or changing the stable\r\nand feed, may cause it. Extremely fat animals and animals that are rapidly\r\nputting on fat are predisposed to this disorder. Improper methods of\r\nfeeding, lack of exercise, constipation and excitement are the most common\r\ncauses. Passive congestion may result from pressure on the jugular vein by\r\nobstructing the flow of blood from the brain, and raising blood pressure in\r\nthe blood-vessels of the brain. It is sometimes caused by organic heart\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ come on very suddenly in congestion of the brain. The\r\ndisease may manifest itself as soon as the animal is moved out of the stall\r\nor bed, or it may come on while it is feeding. In slight cases, the animal\r\nappears excited and restless, the eyes are bright, the pupils are dilated,\r\nand the pulse beats and respirations quickened. If the animal is moving\r\nabout, it may stop suddenly and show marked symptoms of a nervous disorder,\r\nsuch as turning around, running straight ahead and falling down. The period\r\nof excitement is usually brief and may be followed by marked depression.\r\nThe mucous membranes of the head are a deep, red color.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ in anaemic conditions of the brain are loss of\r\nconsciousness, stumbling, falling to the ground and sometimes convulsions.\r\nThe pig and dog may vomit. Favorable cases return to the normal within a\r\nfew hours. Acute inflammatory diseases of the brain and its coverings are\r\nassociated with cerebral hyperaemia or congestion.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ of mild cases is to give the animal quiet, well-ventilated\r\nquarters, where it can not injure itself. The animal should be first\r\nsubjected to a severe diet and later given easily-digested feed. If it\r\nappears greatly excited, bleeding should be practised. Cold applications to\r\nthe head should be used in all cases in the small animals. For internal\r\ntreatment, purgatives are indicated. In cases of anaemia, stimulants,\r\nvigorous massage, artificial respiration and injection of physiological\r\nsalt solution are indicated.\r\n\r\nSUNSTROKE AND HEATSTROKE.--Most writers make no distinction between\r\nheatstroke and sunstroke. The latter is caused by the direct rays of the\r\nsun falling on the animal, and the former from a high temperature and poor\r\ncirculation of air in the surroundings. Under such conditions, the physical\r\ncondition of the animal and exertion play an important part in the\r\nproduction of the nervous disturbance.\r\n\r\n_The first symptoms_ usually noted are rapid, labored breathing, depression\r\nand an anxious expression on the face. The horse usually stops sweating.\r\nThe body temperature is extremely high, the pulse beats weak, the animal\r\ntrembles, falls to the ground and dies in a convulsion. Unless measures\r\ndirected toward relief of the animal are taken early in the attack, death\r\ncommonly occurs. Overheating is rather common in horses that are worked\r\nhard during the extremely warm weather. Horses that have been once\r\noverheated are afterwards unable to stand severe work during the hot months\r\nof the year. Horses in this condition become unthrifty, do not sweat freely\r\nand pant if the work is hard and the weather is warm.\r\n\r\n_The preventive measures_ consist in not exposing animals that are fat, or\r\nout of condition to severe exercise if the day is close and hot, especially\r\nif they are not accustomed to it. When handling or working animals during\r\nhot weather all possible precautions to prevent overheating should be\r\npractised.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in placing the animal in a cool, shady place and\r\nfomenting the body with cold water. The cold packs or cold fomentations\r\nshould be applied to the head and forepart of the body only. Small doses of\r\nstimulants may be given.\r\n\r\nMENINGO-CEREBRITIS.--The discussion of inflammation of the brain and its\r\ncoverings can be combined conveniently, as the causes, symptoms and\r\ntreatment vary but little. This disorder is met with in all species of\r\ndomestic animals, but it is most common in horses and mules. Some writers\r\nstate that meningo-cerebritis is more common during the warm season than it\r\nis in the winter. However, this does not hold true in all sections. In the\r\nmiddle west, this disease is more common in late fall and winter.\r\n\r\n_It is commonly caused_ by taking into the body with the feed and water\r\ncertain organisms and toxins that are capable of producing an inflammation\r\nof the brain. The infectious organism or toxins are taken up by the\r\nabsorbing vessels of the intestines.\r\n\r\nThe secondary form of the disease usually occurs in connection with other\r\ndiseases such as influenza, tuberculosis and acute pharyngitis, or as a\r\nresult of wound infection. Unhygienic conditions, as unsanitary and poorly\r\nventilated stables and filthy drinking places, play a very important part\r\nin the production of the simple or acute form of meningitis.\r\n\r\nSudden changes in the feed and the feeding of rotten, mouldy feeds may\r\ncause it. In the fall and winter it may follow the feeding of too heavy a\r\nration of shredded fodder or any other dry feed. Other exciting causes are\r\noverexertion, changes in climate, excitement, injuries to the head and the\r\nfeeding of too heavy and concentrated a ration.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ vary in the different individuals, but in general they are\r\nthe same. At first the animal is dull, or extremely nervous and sensitive\r\nto sounds. The pupils of the eye are unevenly contracted at first, later\r\ndilated. The eyes may appear staring, or they are rolled about, so that the\r\nwhite portion is prominent. The unusual excitement is manifested in\r\ndifferent ways by the different species. During the dull period the animal\r\nis indifferent to its surroundings. When it is excited, the pulse beats and\r\nrespirations are accelerated. The body temperature is often elevated early\r\nin the disease. There is a partial or complete loss of appetite. Paralysis\r\nmay be the most prominent symptom. The animal lies in a natural position,\r\nor stretched out and lifting the head occasionally and moving the limbs,\r\nbut it is unable to rise. Loss of sensibility may gradually progress until\r\nthe animal becomes semiconscious, or comatose.\r\n\r\nIn case the inflammation is acute and involves the greater portion of the\r\nbrain and its coverings, death occurs within a few days. Occasionally the\r\nanimal survives several weeks. There are few permanent or complete\r\nrecoveries.\r\n\r\n_The principal lines of treatment_ are preventive measures and careful\r\nnursing. This is one of the diseases that can be largely prevented by\r\nobserving all possible sanitary precautions in caring for animals. It is\r\nadmitted by writers that the greater majority of cases of inflammation of\r\nthe brain and its coverings are caused by infection. Proper stable\r\nconstruction, ventilation and disposal of the manure, an occasional\r\ndisinfection of the stable, cleaning and disinfecting the drinking places\r\nand water tanks, and the necessary attention to the ration greatly reduce\r\nthe loss from this disease.\r\n\r\nThe animal should be gotten into a dark, quiet, roomy stall that is well\r\nbedded. A swing may be placed under a large animal if it is able to support\r\nany of its weight, and there is no evidence of nervous excitement. We\r\nshould do nothing to disturb it. If possible, the position of the animal\r\nthat is unable to get up should be changed, and the bed kept clean and dry.\r\nCold in the form of wet or ice packs should be applied to the head during\r\nthe acute stage. Symptoms of excitement must be overcome by large doses of\r\nsedatives. Iodide of potassium and strychnine may help in overcoming the\r\nparalysis. The bowels should be emptied by giving an occasional physic. A\r\nvery light, easily digested diet should be fed.\r\n\r\nPARTIAL OR COMPLETE PARALYSIS OF THE POSTERIOR PORTION OF THE BODY.--This\r\ndisorder is especially common in the small animals. The hog is most\r\nfrequently affected.\r\n\r\n_The following causes_ may be mentioned: Inflammation of the spinal cord\r\ncommonly occurs in influenza, strangles and mixed infections; constipation\r\nbrought on by improper feeding and insufficient exercise is a predisposing\r\ncause; injuries such as strains and blows in the region of the back may\r\nalso cause it; compression of the spinal cord by the vertebrae is no doubt\r\na very common cause; dislocation, enlargement of the disks between the\r\nvertebrae, bony enlargements resulting from strains and injuries, rickets,\r\ntuberculosis and actinomycosis and tumors commonly cause compression of the\r\ncord. It is rarely caused by parasites. Young, fat animals are especially\r\nprone to injuries in the region of the back. Such animals may suffer from\r\nmalnutrition of the bones, and complete fractures of the thigh bones may\r\noccur. Extreme heat from the sun's rays and close, hot quarters are\r\nprobable causes.\r\n\r\n_The symptom_ that is most prominent is the partial or complete loss of\r\ncontrol over the movements of the hind parts. The appetite may be little\r\ninterfered with. The animal may sit on the haunches, with the limbs\r\nprojecting forward, or swing the hind quarters from side to side in walking\r\nor trotting. Irregularity in the animal's movements is especially\r\nnoticeable when turning or backing. In case the animal suffers pain, the\r\nspine is held rigid or arched, and when forced to move, marked evidence of\r\npain occurs. There may be a decrease or increase in the sensibility of the\r\npart. The increase in sensibility is noticed on striking the muscles with\r\nthe hand or rubbing the hair the wrong way. Spasmodic twitching or\r\ncontractions in the muscles sometimes occur. There is frequent elevation of\r\ntemperature. The animal is unable to pass urine or faeces, or there may be\r\nan involuntary passage of the body excretions.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of this disease is unfavorable. Acute inflammation of the\r\ncovering of the cord may subside within a few days. Cases that do not\r\nrecover within a few weeks should be destroyed. Paralysis of the hind parts\r\nshould not be confused with rheumatism, azoturia and other disorders that\r\nmay interfere with the movements of the posterior portion of the body.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is largely along preventive lines. A predisposition toward\r\nrickets, and injuries, may be prevented by feeding a proper ration, and\r\npermitting the animal to take exercise. The quarters and the attendant are\r\nfrequently responsible for injuries. If this is the case, the rough\r\nhandling of the animals should be immediately corrected, and any condition\r\nof the quarters that favors the crowding or piling up of animals should be\r\nchanged. Large animals may be placed in swings if they are able to support\r\na part of their weight on the hind limbs. This is especially indicated at\r\nthe very beginning of the disorder. Small animals should be given a good\r\nbed. A very light, easily digested ration should be fed. An occasional\r\nphysic should be administered. Strychnine and iodide of potassium may be\r\ngiven. Cold applications to the back are indicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. What organs comprise the central portion of the nervous system?\r\n   Peripheral portion?\r\n\r\n2.

The cells of the outer layer or epidermis are of two\r\nkinds. The superficial portion is formed by horny, flattened cells and the\r\ndeeper by softer cells. This layer of the skin varies greatly in thickness\r\nin the different species. The derma is composed of some muscular fibres\r\ninterwoven with the connective-tissue fibres. It contains the roots of the\r\nhair follicles, sweat and oil glands. The external face which is covered by\r\nthe epidermis shows a multitude of little elevations. These are the\r\nvascular and nervous papillae. In addition, it shows openings through which\r\nthe hairs and the skin glands pass. The inner surface is united more or\r\nless closely to the muscular or underlying tissue by a layer of fibro-fatty\r\ntissue.\r\n\r\n_The appendages of the skin_ are the hairs and horny productions. The horny\r\nproductions comprise the horns, chestnuts, ergots, claws and hoofs.\r\n\r\n_The hair varies_ in length, thickness and coarseness in the different\r\nspecies, and the different regions of the body. In addition, breeding,\r\ncare, heat and cold may cause marked variations in the thickness of the\r\ncoat. Exposure to cold causes the coat to thicken. High temperatures cause\r\nthe short hairs to drop out and the coat to become thin.\r\n\r\nDiseases of the skin may be _classified as parasitic_ and _non-parasitic_.\r\nParasitic skin diseases are caused by animal and vegetable parasites.\r\nNon-parasitic skin diseases are caused by irritation to the skin and\r\ninternal causes. Irritation to the skin may be either chemical, thermic or\r\nmechanical. The internal causes may be due to an individual predisposition\r\ntogether with digestive disturbances and the eating of feeds too rich in\r\nprotein. In this chapter parasitic skin diseases produced by insects will\r\nnot be discussed.\r\n\r\nFALLING OUT OF THE HAIR AND FEATHERS.--Falling out of the hair and feathers\r\nfrequently occurs independent of parasitic diseases. This condition does\r\nnot occur as an independent disorder, but as a secondary affection. It is\r\ndue to faulty nutrition, and irritation to the skin. Intestinal diseases,\r\ninsufficient feed and feed of bad quality are common causes. Animals that\r\nare fed a heavy ration, or that lie on dirty, wet bedding frequently lose\r\nlarge patches of hair. Sheep that are dipped in late fall and early winter,\r\nor exposed to wet, cold weather may lose a part of their fleece. It is not\r\nuncommon for animals toward the latter period of pregnancy, or that sweat\r\nfreely, to lose patches of hair.\r\n\r\nFalling out of the hair heals of itself within a few weeks.\r\n\r\n_The preventive measures_ are of special importance in sheep and horses.\r\nThis consists in avoiding conditions that may lead to alopecia and in\r\ncorrecting the diet. In horses the regions of the mane and tail should be\r\nwashed with soap, or rubbed with alcohol and spirits of camphor, equal\r\nparts. Treatment should be persisted in for a long period if necessary.\r\n\r\nURTICARIA, \"NETTLERASH.\"--Urticaria is characterized by roundish elevations\r\nthat appear quickly and become scattered over a part or the whole surface\r\nof the skin. They are caused by an inflammatory infiltration of the deeper\r\nlayers of the skin. Horses and hogs are most frequently affected.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ of urticaria are irritating juices of certain plants,\r\nsecretions of flies, ants and some caterpillars, irritating drugs,\r\nscratching, sweating and the action of cold on a warm skin. It has been\r\nobserved in connection with the feeding of certain leguminous feeds and\r\ndigestive disturbances. Horses that are fat, or putting on flesh rapidly,\r\nseem to be predisposed to this disorder. Urticaria may occur in certain\r\ninfectious diseases.\r\n\r\n_The characteristic symptom_ is the formation on the skin of roundish\r\nelevations or \"hives.\" There may be an elevation of body temperature and\r\npartial loss of appetite. Small animals may act restless and show evidence\r\nof itching or pain. This symptom is very common in hogs. The eruption may\r\nlast only a few hours or a few days, or, because of the animal's scratching\r\nor rubbing the part, the skin may become scabby and small pustules form.\r\n\r\nAn important _preventive measure_ is to avoid the use of agents capable of\r\nirritating the skin and producing urticaria when treating parasitic skin\r\ndiseases. It is very advisable to give the animal a saline cathartic (Epsom\r\nor Glauber's salts). The skin may be washed with cold water, or a weak\r\nwater solution of permanganate of potassium.\r\n\r\nACNE, \"SUMMER RASH.\"--In this skin disease the oil glands and hair\r\nfollicles are inflamed and sometimes infected with pus germs. This results\r\nin skin eruptions varying in size from the point of a pin to about a\r\nquarter of an inch in diameter. This inflammation is most prominent during\r\nthe warm weather.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ are local irritation to the skin from lying on filthy floors,\r\nsweating and irritation from the harness. According to some writers, pus\r\ngerms are the only cause, the mechanical agents merely aiding in the\r\nproduction of the infection.\r\n\r\nThe face, side of the neck, shoulders, back and sides of the trunk and\r\nquarters are the usual seats of disease. The pimples or nodules may\r\ndisappear within a few weeks, or persist throughout the warm season. The\r\neruption may disappear without leaving scars, or suppuration occurs and\r\nsmall bald spots result.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in removing the cause of the disease and cleaning\r\nthe skin with antiseptic washes. The surroundings of the animal must be\r\nkept clean and a good bed provided. If possible, the horse should be laid\r\noff from work as soon as the condition is noted. Washing the part with a\r\nweak water solution of permanganate of potassium may be practised daily.\r\nFowler's solution of arsenic may be given. This may be given with the feed.\r\n\r\nECZEMA.--This is an inflammation of the vascular capillary bodies and the\r\nsuperficial layer of the skin. There may be marked inflammatory exudate,\r\ncausing the surface of the skin to become excessively moist and more or\r\nless itching. Redness, vesicles and pustules may characterize the\r\ninflammation. In the chronic form the skin may become thickened and greatly\r\nchanged in structure.\r\n\r\nEczematous inflammation of the skin may occur in all domestic animals, but\r\nit is most common in the dog. In the horse local eczema (scratches) is\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nThe most frequent _cause_ is external irritation. Accumulations of filth on\r\nthe skin and continual wetting of the part are common causes. Mechanical\r\ncauses are rubbing, pressure, the action of the sun's rays and chemical\r\nirritants. Internal causes, such as catarrhal diseases of the stomach and\r\nweakness and emaciation from disease, may act as direct or predisposing\r\ncauses. Tender-skinned animals seem to be predisposed to the disease.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ vary in the different species of animals. In the horse the\r\nthin skin posterior to the fetlock and knee, in front of the hock and on\r\nthe under side of the body is most commonly inflamed. Moisture and dirt\r\nseem to be the most common causes. Eczema may involve the skin covered by\r\nthe mane and tail in animals that are not properly groomed and inclined to\r\nrub or scratch. Cattle may suffer from eczematous inflammations in the\r\nregion of the forehead, back of neck and base of tail. A very common form\r\nof the disease involves the space between the toes. Sheep frequently suffer\r\nfrom inflammation of the skin over the fetlock region. The skin of animals\r\nhaving long fleeces, or heavy coats of hair that become wet at a time when\r\nthere is no opportunity to dry out quickly, may become inflamed. Dogs are\r\ncommonly affected by the acute and chronic forms of eczema. Eczema of swine\r\nis limited mostly to young hogs. It is rather rare, excepting in hogs that\r\nare pasturing on certain kinds of clover and rape, or on muck lands.\r\n\r\nThe inflammation is accompanied by a marked tenderness and itching, and the\r\nanimal licks and scratches the part. This increases the extent of the skin\r\nlesions. The skin appears moist, later dirty, scabby and thickened. Cracks\r\nand pustules may form. Gangrene and sloughing of the skin may occur.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. Cases of eczema caused by\r\nfilth and wetness can be prevented by giving the necessary attention to\r\nkeeping the skin clean and not allowing animals access to muddy, filthy\r\nplaces. Keeping the bed clean and regulating the diet are important\r\npreventive measures. Before the inflammation can be successfully treated\r\nthe cause must be removed.\r\n\r\nIn acute eczema it is advisable to protect the part against water, filth\r\nand air. Powders and ointments may be used during the early stages of the\r\ninflammation. Two parts boric acid, four parts flour, and one part tannic\r\nacid may be dusted over the moist surface. One part zinc oxide and twelve\r\nparts vaseline is a useful ointment. Scratching the part should be\r\ncontrolled in every case by muzzles, collars and bandages. Dirt and scales\r\nmay be removed from the skin by washing with cotton soaked in lime water or\r\nlinseed oil. The animal should receive laxative doses of Glauber's salts or\r\noil every few days. A simple, easily digested ration should be fed. The\r\nfollowing mixture may be applied in obstinate cases: oil of tar and soft\r\nsoap, two parts each, and alcohol one part.\r\n\r\nCOMMON FEED RASHES.--This title includes inflammation of the skin caused by\r\npasturing on buckwheat, certain clovers and rape, together with moisture\r\nand sunlight.\r\n\r\nGreen, flowering buckwheat is more dangerous as a feed for stock than is\r\nthe grain or straw. Clovers and rape are not as dangerous a feed. The\r\nactual cause of the skin becoming inflamed is not known.\r\n\r\nThe skin in the regions of the face, ears, neck, lower surface of the body\r\nand limbs becomes red and covered with vesicles. Later, scabs and pus may\r\nform.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in changing the ration and keeping the animals out\r\nof the sun, or long grass and weeds for a few days. This is all the\r\ntreatment required in most cases. It may be advisable to administer a\r\nphysic. If pus and scabs form, the part should be cleansed daily with a one\r\nper cent water solution of permanganate of potassium.\r\n\r\nHERPES (FUNGOUS SKIN DISEASE).--This is a contagious disease of the skin\r\ncaused by thread fungi, _Tricophyton tonsurans_ and _epilans_, which\r\ndevelop in the skin in localized areas, causing vesicles, scabs or scales\r\nto appear, and the loss of the hair over the part. This skin disease occurs\r\nin all domestic animals, but it is most commonly met with in cattle. It\r\nusually affects young cattle. It most commonly occurs in the region of the\r\nface and neck. Thick, bran-like crusts form over the scattered areas of the\r\nskin and the hair drops out or breaks off. The animals frequently rub the\r\ninfected area.\r\n\r\n_Prompt treatment_ may prevent the spread of this disease in the herd. It\r\nmay be checked by quarantining the infected animals and scrubbing the\r\nstalls, stanchions and walls with a disinfecting solution. Grooming the\r\ninfected animal should be discontinued. This skin disease responds most\r\nreadily to ointments. Flowers of sulfur one part and lard ten parts is\r\ncommonly used by stockmen. Sulfur-iodide ointment, or tincture of iodine\r\nmay be applied.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Give a general description of the skin.\r\n\r\n2.

The\r\n_orbit_ is lined by fibro-fatty tissues that form a cushion for the eye.\r\nAnteriorly it is protected by the _eyelids_, and in birds by a third eyelid\r\nthat corresponds to the membrana nictitans of quadrupeds. The _lachrymal\r\ngland_ which secretes the tears keeps the above parts moist.\r\n\r\n_The eye_ is the essential organ of vision. It is formed by a spherical\r\nshell which encloses fluid or semisolid parts. The shell is anteriorly made\r\nup of a transparent convex membrane, the cornea, while the remainder of its\r\nwall is formed by three opaque layers or tunics.\r\n\r\nThe external tunic is the _sclerotic_. It is a white, solid membrane,\r\nforming about four-fifths of the external shell. Its external face is\r\nrelated to the muscles and fatty cushion. It receives posteriorly, a little\r\nlower than its middle portion, the insertion of the _optic nerve_, which\r\npasses through the shell and spreads out to form a very thin membrane, the\r\nretina or internal coat.\r\n\r\n_The retina_ lines about two-thirds of the posterior portion of the shell\r\nof the eye. It is made up of seven layers. The essential layer is named\r\nfrom its appearance, rods and cones.\r\n\r\nThe middle coat is the _choroid_. This is a dark, pigmented, vascular and\r\nmuscular membrane. The posterior portion is in contact with the retina.\r\nAnteriorly it forms the ciliary processes and the iris.\r\n\r\n_The media_ of the eye are the crystalline lens, vitreous and aqueous\r\nhumors. The _crystalline lens_ is a transparent, biconvex body sustained by\r\nthe ciliary processes. The _vitreous humor_ is a transparent jelly-like\r\nsubstance that fills all the cavity of the eye posterior to the lens. The\r\n_aqueous humor_ is a liquid, contained in the anterior and posterior\r\nchambers of the eye in front of the lens. This fluid separates the iris\r\nfrom the front of the lens.\r\n\r\nEXAMINATION OF THE EYE.--In examining and treating the eye we should avoid\r\nrough and hasty manipulation. The animal should be approached slowly. It is\r\nbest for the attendant who is familiar with the animal to hold it for the\r\nexaminer. It is advisable on approaching the animal to stroke its face, and\r\nin the horse to brush its foretop away. The hand should be carried slowly\r\nto the front of the eye, and the lids separated with the fingers and thumb\r\nif we wish to obtain a better view of the cornea. In cattle the best view\r\nof these parts can be obtained by taking hold of the nose and lifting the\r\nhead. It is impossible to make a satisfactory examination of the eye\r\noutside of the stable where the light is coming from all directions. The\r\nmost satisfactory conditions under which a general examination can be made\r\nis to stand the animal facing a transom, window or open door. We may then\r\nlook directly into the eye and note the condition of the different\r\nrefracting media.\r\n\r\nThe lens should appear transparent and free from scars. The aqueous humor\r\nfree from any cloudiness or precipitate. Both pupillary openings should be\r\nthe same size, and not too small or too large in the bright light. As we\r\nlook through the pupillary openings, both the lens and the vitreous humor\r\nshould refract the light properly and not appear white or greenish-white in\r\ncolor. The color of the iris should be noted. If it lacks lustre or appears\r\ndull, this may indicate an inflammation. In periodic ophthalmia in horses\r\nthe iris loses its lustre and becomes a rusty-brown color. It is very\r\nimportant to note this change in the appearance of the iris. We should\r\nnote, in addition, the expression of the animal's face, the position of the\r\nears and eyelids and manner of the walk. Horses that have defective sight\r\nmay show a deep wrinkle in the upper eyelid when startled or looking\r\ndirectly at an object. Animals that are blind hold the ears in a\r\ncharacteristic position, and may stumble and walk over, or run into objects\r\nunless stopped. The ophthalmoscope is a very useful instrument for\r\ndetermining the condition of the different structures of the eyes, when in\r\nthe hands of persons who are trained in its use.\r\n\r\nCONJUNCTIVITIS.--This is an inflammation of the mucous membrane lining the\r\neyelids and covering the eyeball. The two forms of conjunctivitis common in\r\ndomestic animals are the _catarrhal_ and _purulent_.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms differ_ in the two forms of conjunctivitis. They may be\r\ndistinguished from each other by the difference in the character of the\r\ninflammatory discharge. In the catarrhal form, there is a discharge of\r\ntears and the lids are held more or less closed. The mucous membrane is\r\nusually brick red in color and swollen. A little later the discharge\r\nbecomes heavier and adheres more to the margins of the lids. The lids\r\ncontinue tender and the inflammation painful. The surface of the cornea may\r\nappear white and the blood-vessels prominent, but it is only in the severe\r\ncases that inflammation of this portion of the eye occurs. In such cases an\r\nelevation in body temperature may occur. This is especially true of\r\npurulent conjunctivitis when primarily caused by an infectious agent. In\r\nthe purulent form the discharge is heavy and pus-like.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. The first object must be\r\nto remove the cause. Irritating gases resulting from stable filth should be\r\nremedied by correcting the unsanitary conditions in the stable. Conditions\r\nfavoring injury to the eye from foreign bodies, such as chaff and a\r\ncareless attendant, should be corrected. Animals suffering from the\r\ninfectious or purulent form of inflammation should be separated from the\r\nother animals. Foreign bodies should be removed promptly before they have\r\nhad an opportunity to set up a serious inflammation. It is necessary to\r\nconfine the animal in some way before attempting to do this. Horses should\r\nbe twitched, cattle held by the nose, and the head of a small animal held\r\nfirmly with the hands. It may be necessary to cocainize the eye before the\r\noperator can remove the foreign object with absorbent cotton or with\r\nforceps.\r\n\r\nIn case of injuries and irritation to the lids by foreign bodies, the eye\r\nmay be flooded with a three per cent water solution of boric acid twice\r\ndaily, or as often as necessary. Such washes or lotions may be applied with\r\na small piece of absorbent cotton, using a fresh piece each time the eye is\r\ndressed. A medicine dropper may also be used. A lotion containing silver\r\nnitrate two to four grains and distilled water one ounce, is useful in\r\ncombating the inflammation. This may be applied twice daily. Irritating\r\nlotions should be avoided, if possible, in the treatment of eye diseases of\r\nhorses, because of the danger of making the animal disagreeable to handle.\r\nBoric acid may be dusted over the ball of the eye of cattle with a powder\r\nblower.\r\n\r\nPERIODIC OPHTHALMIA, \"MOONBLINDNESS.\"--This is a periodic inflammation of\r\none or both eyes of the horse. The internal structures of the eye are\r\ninvolved by the inflammation, but it may appear as a conjunctivitis.\r\n\r\n_The cause_ of this disease is not well understood. Certain local\r\nconditions seem to favor its development. Undrained land, a humid climate,\r\nthe feeding of a one-sided ration or one that does not maintain the\r\nvitality of the animal, and severe work seem to produce it. Heredity must\r\nbe accepted as a prominent accessory cause. A number of different bacteria\r\nhave been mentioned as causative factors for this disease.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ at the very beginning indicate a general inflammation of the\r\neye. The eyelids are swollen, there is an abundant secretion of tears, the\r\neyeball is retracted and the lids are held more or less closed. As the\r\ninflammation progresses, the cornea becomes milky in appearance and the\r\naqueous humor may show a precipitate toward the bottom of the anterior\r\nchamber. The pupil is usually contracted and dilates slowly when the animal\r\nis moved into the light. The acute inflammation gradually subsides, and\r\nabout the tenth to the fourteenth day the lids and cornea may appear\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nThe periods between these acute attacks of ophthalmia may vary from a few\r\nweeks to several months. Severe work, debility and the character of the\r\nration influence their frequency. It is not uncommon for animals that have\r\nbeen given a rest to suffer from a second attack on being put to work. The\r\nattendant may observe a hazy or whitish condition of the margin of the\r\ncornea. The upper lid may show an abrupt bend of its margin and a deep\r\nwrinkle. The color of the iris appears to have lost its lustre, and the\r\naqueous humor and lens may be cloudy. After a variable number of attacks\r\nglaucoma or cataract develops.\r\n\r\n_The history_ of the case will enable the attendant to recognize this form\r\nof ophthalmia.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ is unsatisfactory. Preventive measures consist in avoiding\r\nconditions favorable to the production of the disease. This should be\r\npractised so far as possible. At the time the attack occurs, the animal\r\nshould be given a cathartic. One pound of Glauber's salts in a drench is to\r\nbe preferred. Rest in a darkened stall is indicated. An eye lotion\r\ncontaining three grains of silver nitrate in one ounce of distilled water\r\nshould be applied to the eye three times daily. A water solution of\r\natropine or eserine should be used for the purpose of relieving the\r\nsymptoms of iritis or glaucoma. A very light diet should be fed.\r\n\r\nINFECTIOUS OPHTHALMIA OF RUMINANTS.--This occurs as an acute inflammation\r\nof the eyelids and cornea. The disease is highly infectious, affecting all\r\nof the susceptible animals in the herd. It commonly occurs during the late\r\nsummer and fall.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms appear_ suddenly. The animal is feverish, the eyes closed and\r\nthe cheeks are wet with tears. The cornea becomes clouded, white and\r\nopaque. In severe cases, the blood-vessels around the margin of the cornea\r\nbecome prominent, and ulcers form on its surface. The animal's appetite is\r\nimpaired or lost. There is loss of flesh and temporary blindness. The\r\nblindness in one or both eyes may persist for a period of from two weeks to\r\nseveral months. Permanent blindness is comparatively rare.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in practising the necessary precautions\r\nagainst the introduction of the disease into the herd, and in carefully\r\nquarantining the first cases of the disease that appear. The affected\r\nanimal should be given a darkened stall, and fed a very light ration until\r\nthe acute inflammation has subsided. From one to one and one-half pounds of\r\nGlauber's salts should be given. The _local treatment_ consists in the\r\napplication of antiseptic lotions or powders to the eye. Equal parts of\r\nboric acid and calomel, dusted into the eye twice daily with a powder\r\nblower, is a very effective treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Name the different structures that form the shell of the eye; name and\r\n   describe the different media of the eye.\r\n\r\n2. Give the general method of examining the eyes of horses.\r\n\r\n3.

The bones meet and form _joints_ or\r\n_articulations_. These are divided into three classes: _movable_, _mixed_\r\nand _immovable_. Nearly all of the articulations in the extremities belong\r\nto the movable class. The articulations between the bodies of the vertebrae\r\nbelong to the mixed, and those between the flat bones of the head to the\r\nimmovable class.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Skeleton of horse.]\r\n\r\nThe bony surfaces that meet and form the different types of articulations\r\nare held together by ligaments (Fig. 29). Sometimes the ligament is placed\r\nbetween the bony surfaces, but usually it is attached to the margins of the\r\narticular surfaces that it unites. The _immovable class_ possesses\r\nfibrous-like ligaments that are placed between the margins of the flat\r\nbones that form the articulation. The _mixed articulations_ are united by a\r\nfibro-cartilaginous pad that is firmly attached to the articular faces of\r\nthe bones, and by peripheral ligaments that may be flat or formed by\r\nscattered fibres. All _movable articulations_ are formed by bony surfaces\r\nencrusted with a thin cartilaginous layer that makes them perfectly smooth,\r\nligaments and complimentary cartilages. Sometimes the bony surfaces do not\r\nfit each other, and we find between them _fibro-cartilages_ that complete\r\nthe articulation by adapting the articular surfaces to each other. _Round_\r\nor _flat ligaments_ may extend from one articular surface to the other, and\r\nattached to the margins of the articulation are _membranous, flat_ or\r\n_round ligaments_. Muscles and tendons that cross the articulations should\r\nbe included among the structures binding them together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Photograph of model of stifle joint, showing:\r\nligaments; complementary cartilages; femur; and tibia.]\r\n\r\nMovable joints possess a _synovial membrane_. This membrane lines the\r\nstructures that enclose the articulation and secretes a fluid, _the\r\nsynovia_, that lubricates the surfaces.\r\n\r\n_The muscles_ are the contractile organs that move the body. The movement\r\nof the different parts of the body is rendered possible through the manner\r\nin which the skeletal muscles are inserted into the long bones, by which\r\nthe lever motion is possible. A muscle originating on one bone and\r\nterminating on another either moves both bones toward each other or, if one\r\nattachment is fixed, the movable is drawn toward the fixed part.\r\n\r\nWe may class muscles as _striated_ or _voluntary_ and _unstriated_ or\r\n_involuntary._ A third class, _mixed,_ is represented by the heart muscle.\r\nThe striated is represented by the skeletal muscles, and the unstriated by\r\nthe thin muscular layers that form part of the wall of the stomach,\r\nintestines, bladder and other hollow organs.\r\n\r\nRHEUMATISM.--This is an inflammation of the tissues that form the\r\nlocomotory apparatus. The effect of cold on the muscles and tendons is an\r\nimportant factor in its production. It differs from other inflammations by\r\nshifting from one part to another. It is termed _muscular rheumatism_ when\r\nit affects the muscles, tendons and fascia, and _articular rheumatism_ when\r\nit involves the articulations. A second classification, _acute_ and\r\n_chronic,_ depends on the character of the inflammation. The muscular form\r\nis common in horses, dogs and hogs, while the articular form more commonly\r\naffects cattle.\r\n\r\n_The following causes_ may be considered. Animals that are exposed to cold,\r\nwet, changeable weather, or kept in cold, damp, draughty quarters\r\nfrequently suffer from rheumatism. Under such conditions it is very\r\nprobable that imperfect metabolism of body tissue occurs, and certain toxic\r\nproducts that are capable of irritating the muscles and articulations form.\r\nClinical symptoms, and the presence of bacteria in the inflamed tissue\r\nindicate that bacteria and their toxins play an important part in the\r\ndevelopment of articular rheumatism. Heredity is said to be an important\r\npredisposing factor. One attack always predisposes the animal to a second.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms vary_ according to the severity of the attack. Local\r\nrheumatism is not accompanied by serious symptoms. The regions most\r\ncommonly involved in local, muscular rheumatism are the shoulder, neck and\r\nback. The joints affected in the articular form are the knee, fetlock, hip,\r\nelbow and shoulder. The attack is usually sudden and accompanied by fever,\r\nmore or less loss of appetite and soreness. Loss of control over the\r\nmovement of the hind parts or walking on the knees may occur in the smaller\r\nanimals. The larger animals show a slight or severe lameness. The affected\r\nmuscle or articulation may be swollen, hot and tender. Pressing on the part\r\nwith the hand or forcing the animal to move about may cause severe pain.\r\nWeakness and emaciation may occur in generalized and articular rheumatism,\r\nespecially if suppuration takes place in the affected joint.\r\n\r\n_The prognosis_ is more favorable in muscular rheumatism than in the\r\narticular form. Both forms may become chronic. It is frequently advisable\r\nto destroy animals suffering from the articular form because of their\r\nemaciated, weakened condition and the deformed condition of the joints.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in avoiding conditions favorable to the\r\nproduction of rheumatism. In ventilating the stable we should avoid\r\ndraughts. Practical experience indicates that allowing a horse to stand in\r\na draught after it has been warmed up by exercise is a very common source\r\nof muscular rheumatism and is especially to be avoided. Young hogs and sows\r\nthat are thin are very prone to rheumatism when given wet, draughty\r\nsleeping quarters. Houses having dirt or loose board floors are very often\r\ndraughty. Concrete floors when wet and not properly bedded with straw are\r\nobjectionable. Although we do not fully understand the causative factors,\r\nwe can take advantage of the knowledge we have gained from practical\r\nexperience, and avoid keeping animals under conditions that are favorable\r\nfor the production of the disease. It is almost useless to treat rheumatism\r\nunless the conditions under which it occurred are corrected.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both local and internal. The local treatment consists in\r\napplying a mild liniment to the part, together with massage. If the part is\r\ntender and painful, hot applications may be used. Spirits of camphor ten\r\nparts and turpentine two parts, applied daily, are useful in relieving the\r\nsoreness of rheumatic muscles. Salicylate of soda two ounces, fluid extract\r\nof gentian one ounce, and sufficient water to make an eight-ounce mixture\r\nmay be given internally three times daily after feeding. Of the above\r\nmixture horses and cattle may be given one-half ounce and sheep and swine\r\nfrom one to two drachms. The treatment should be continued for a period of\r\nfrom eight to ten days or longer. It may be repeated in from one to two\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Atrophy of the muscles of the thigh resulting from\r\nan attack of azoturia.]\r\n\r\nIodide of potassium is very useful in the treatment of chronic articular\r\nrheumatism. A very light diet should be fed and the animal given as\r\ncomplete rest as possible. An occasional physic should be given.\r\n\r\nAZOTURIA, HAEMOGLOBINURIA.--This is a disease of solipeds affecting the\r\nmuscles of the quarters. The affected muscles become swollen, hard and\r\nparalyzed. The disease follows a short rest, and rarely occurs when the\r\nanimal is running in pasture or idle for a long period. Animals that are\r\nfat or rapidly putting on fat are predisposed to it. Animals that have had\r\none attack are predisposed to a second.\r\n\r\n_The cause_ of this disease is not positively known. The German\r\nveterinarians attribute it to irritation of the muscles by cold, and\r\nclassify azoturia as a rheumatic disorder. The conditions preceding the\r\nattack are not in favor of this theory, and cold can not be considered an\r\nimportant causative factor. The most acceptable is the auto-poisoning\r\ntheory advanced by Dr. Law.\r\n\r\nAzoturia is common in the country where feed is abundant and wrong methods\r\nof feeding horses are commonly practised. It is a very common practice to\r\nfeed horses accustomed to hard work the same ration when idle for a few\r\ndays as when working. The blood of horses cared for in this way may become\r\nabnormally rich in albuminoids. The suddenness of the attack, occurring\r\nshortly after the animal is given exercise, indicates auto-poisoning. This\r\nmay be due to the blood in the portal vessels and the liver capillaries,\r\ncharged with nutritious and waste products from the overfed animal's\r\nintestines, being suddenly thrown into the general circulation by a more\r\nactive circulation of the blood brought on by exercise.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ of disease are manifested shortly after the animal is moved\r\nout of the stall and given exercise. When the animal is first exercised it\r\nis usually in high spirits. After travelling a short distance it is noticed\r\nto sweat more freely than ordinarily, breathe rapidly, lag and go lame,\r\nusually in the hind limbs. It trembles, shows evidence of suffering severe\r\npain by turning its head and looking around toward the flanks, knuckles\r\nover in the hind pasterns, and may fall down and be unable to get up. The\r\naffected muscles appear to be swollen and feel unusually firm when pressed\r\nupon with the hand. If the horse does not go down recovery may occur within\r\na few hours, and we are able to move the horse to the stable. Dark brown\r\nurine may be passed. At other times, the animal lies in a natural position,\r\npossesses a good appetite, but can not stand. In the severe form, it is\r\nrestless and shows marked nervous symptoms.\r\n\r\n_The prognosis_ is unfavorable in the severe form. When nervous symptoms\r\nare absent recovery usually occurs in from two to ten days. Complications\r\nare common. More or less atrophy of the muscles of the quarters may result\r\n(Fig. 30).\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in avoiding conditions that may favor\r\nthe production of the disease. More attention should be given the feeding\r\nand care of work animals. If it is not possible to permit horses that are\r\nworked to exercise in a lot or pasture when idle, the ration should be\r\nreduced and roots, chopped, or soft feed given.\r\n\r\nCareful nursing is an important part of the _treatment_. As soon as the\r\nhorse shows evidence of an attack, it should be stopped and allowed to\r\nstand until sufficiently recovered to be moved. If paralysis occurs, we\r\nshould make it as comfortable as possible and arrange to move it to a\r\ncomfortable, warm, well-bedded stall. It may be advisable to place the\r\nanimal in slings. This is not advisable in the serious form of the disease\r\nbecause of the extent of the paralysis and the nervous symptoms. A very\r\nlight diet, bran mashes, chopped hay or green feed, should be fed during\r\nthe convalescent period and for several days after complete recovery has\r\noccurred.\r\n\r\nThe following lines of _medicinal treatment_ may be recommended. We should\r\nendeavor to stimulate the elimination of the waste products from the body\r\nby way of the kidneys, intestines and skin. This may be accomplished by\r\nadministering saline cathartics, covering the body with blankets,\r\nencouraging the animal to drink plenty of water and feeding soft feeds.\r\nGlauber's salts may be given as a drench, or eserine may be given\r\nhypodermically. Sedatives such as chloral hydrate may be used to quiet the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Give a general description of the locomotory apparatus.\r\n\r\n2. Give the causes of rheumatism; describe the treatment.\r\n\r\n3. What is azoturia? Give the cause of this disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nSTRUCTURE OF THE LIMBS OF THE HORSE\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL DISCUSSION.--Each limb is formed by a column of bones that rest\r\nupon one another, forming more or less open angles. The bones of the column\r\nmeet and form articulations that are held together by ligaments, and\r\nattached to their faces, borders and extremities are muscles and tendons.\r\nIn the superior portion of the limb the muscles are heavy, tapering\r\ninferiorly, and terminating in the region of the foot in long tendons. Each\r\nlimb is divided into four regions. The regions of the _fore-limb_ are the\r\nshoulder, arm, forearm and forefoot. In the _hind limb_ are the regions of\r\nthe pelvis, haunch, thigh, leg and hind-foot. The feet in turn are divided\r\ninto three sub-regions each. The _forefoot_ is formed by the knee, cannon\r\nand toe, and the _hindfoot_ by the hock, cannon and toe.\r\n\r\nTHE SHOULDER BONE OR SCAPULA is flat and triangular in shape. It is\r\nattached to the trunk by heavy muscles, one of which, together with its\r\nfellow on the opposite side, may be compared to a great, muscular sling\r\nthat supports about two-thirds of the body weight. Attached to the internal\r\nand external faces of the scapula are heavy muscles that pass over the\r\nshoulder-joint, and become attached to the arm bone through the insertion\r\nof their muscular fibres or by a short tendon.\r\n\r\nTHE ARMBONE OR HUMERUS belongs to the class of long bones. Its superior\r\nextremity forms a flattened head that fits rather imperfectly into a\r\nshallow cavity in the humeral angle of the scapula. The inferior extremity\r\nresembles a portion of a cylinder in shape, and fits into shallow\r\ndepressions in the superior extremity of the principal bone of the forearm.\r\nThe muscles here are divided into two regions, anterior and posterior\r\nbrachial. The most of these muscles originate on the posterior border and\r\ninferior extremity of the shoulder bone, and terminate inferiorly on the\r\nsuperior extremities of the principal and second or rudimentary bone of the\r\nforearm. The posterior brachial muscles are heavy and powerful. They are\r\nsometimes termed elbow muscles, because they are attached to the point of\r\nthe elbow.\r\n\r\nTHE REGION OF THE FOREARM is formed by two bones, the _radius_ and _ulna_.\r\nThe radius is the principal bone and is classed among the long bones. The\r\nulna is an elongated flat bone. It is attached to the external portion of\r\nthe posterior face of the radius and extends above the superior extremity\r\nof this bone to form the point of the elbow. The radius articulates with\r\nthe upper row of knee bones. The muscles of this region, the antibrachial,\r\nare divided into two sub-regions, anterior and posterior. They originate\r\nsuperiorly from the lower extremity of the arm bone and the superior\r\nextremities of the bones of the forearm, and terminate toward the lower\r\nextremity of the region in tendons that become attached to the bones of the\r\nknee, cannon and digit.\r\n\r\nTHE KNEE OR CARPAL region is formed by seven short bones that are arranged\r\nin two rows. They form a series of articulations. These are the\r\narticulations between the two rows, between the bones of each row, and\r\nbetween the upper and lower rows and the neighboring regions. Nearly all\r\nthe motion takes place in the articulation between the upper row and the\r\nprincipal bone of the forearm.\r\n\r\nTHE CANNON OR METACARPAL region is formed by three bones. These are the\r\nprincipal metacarpal or cannon bone, and the rudimentary metacarpal or\r\nsplint bones. The latter are attached to the margins of the posterior face\r\nof the cannon bone. The superior extremities of these bones articulate with\r\nthe lower row of carpal bones. The convex extremity of the cannon bone\r\nmeets shallow depressions in the superior extremity of the first digital\r\nbone. This is termed the fetlock joint. The anterior and posterior faces of\r\nthis region are travelled by the long tendons belonging to the extensor and\r\nflexor muscles of the digit.\r\n\r\nTHE DIGIT OR TOE is formed by six bones, three of which are termed\r\naccessory or sesamoids. The digital bones may be given numerical names.\r\n\r\nTHE APPROXIMAL OR THIRD DIGITAL BONE is the shortest long bone in the body.\r\nThe two shallow articular cavities belonging to the superior extremity are\r\ncompleted posteriorly by the two sesamoid bones. The inferior extremity is\r\nsmaller than the superior and resembles the inferior extremity of the\r\ncannon bone in shape, excepting that it shows a middle groove. The anterior\r\nand posterior faces are travelled by the tendons of the digital muscles.\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE OR SECOND DIGITAL BONE is quite short. It articulates superiorly\r\nwith the first, and inferiorly with the third bone of the digit. The\r\nsuperior face shows two shallow cavities, and the inferior two convex\r\nsurfaces separated by a median groove. The latter face articulates with the\r\nthird and navicular bones. The popular name for this articulation is the\r\ncoffin joint.\r\n\r\nTHE THIRD OR DISTAL DIGITAL BONE may be compared to a cone that has been\r\ncut away posteriorly, obliquely downwards and backwards. The superior face\r\nshows two shallow cavities that are completed posteriorly by the superior\r\nface of the coffin or navicular bone. The anterior face is convex and\r\ncribbled by openings, and the inferior face is concave, forming the sole.\r\nTendons belonging to the digital muscles terminate on the summit and\r\ninferior face of this bone.\r\n\r\nTHE PELVIS OR HAUNCH is formed by a single bone, the _coxa_ that in the\r\nfoetus may be divided into three bones. These are the _ilium, pubis_ and\r\n_ischium_. It belongs to the class of flat bones. Anteriorly it is\r\nflattened from before to behind and directed inward and upward. The\r\nexternal angle is rugged and is generally termed the angle of the haunch.\r\nThe internal face of the opposite angle articulates with the sacrum, to\r\nwhich it is firmly attached by ligaments. The middle portion is constricted\r\nand forms a neck. The inferior or posterior portion is flattened from above\r\nto below, and directed inward to meet the border of the opposite bone. Just\r\nbelow the neck and externally, there is a cup-shaped cavity into which the\r\nhead of the thigh bone fits. The two coxa, together with the sacral\r\nligaments (sacrum) and the muscles of the quarter, enclose the pelvic\r\ncavity.\r\n\r\nTHE REGION OF THE THIGH is formed by the _femur_, the largest long bone in\r\nthe body. The superior extremity is formed by a rugged eminence, to which\r\nthe heavy muscles of the quarter are attached, and by an articular head.\r\nThe inferior extremity is formed by two convex articular surfaces that are\r\nseparated by a deep notch, and a third pulley-like articular surface, with\r\nwhich the patella or knee-cap articulates. The pair of condyles articulates\r\nwith the superior extremity of the leg bone. The thigh or femoral region is\r\nheavily muscled.\r\n\r\nTHE LEG is formed by three bones. The patella, a short bone, has already\r\nbeen mentioned as articulating with the thigh bone. The tibia and fibula\r\nare the other two bones in the region.\r\n\r\nTHE TIBIA belongs to the class of long bones and the fibula is quite\r\nrudimentary, being represented by a stylet-shaped bone that lies posterior\r\nto, and along the outer border of the tibia. The superior extremity of the\r\ntibia shows a central spine margined laterally by rather plain articular\r\nfaces. It articulates with the thigh bone. The muscles of this region are\r\ndivided into two sub-regions, _anterior_ and _posterior_ tibial. The\r\nmuscles originate from the lower extremity of the femur and the two bones\r\nin this region, and terminate inferiorly in tendons that are attached to\r\nthe bones of the hock, cannon and digit.\r\n\r\nTHE HOCK OR TARSAL region is formed by six bones. They are described as\r\nforming two rows. In the upper row there are two bones and in the lower\r\nfour. They form a series of articulations, the same as the bones of the\r\nknee. Practically all of the movement occurs in the articulation between\r\none of the large bones in the upper row and the lower extremity of the\r\ntibia. It may be mentioned here that this is the most perfect hinge-joint\r\nin the body. A very large tendon is attached to the summit of the hock.\r\nOther tendons cross and become attached to the hock bones.\r\n\r\nThe regions of the _hind cannon_ and digit are practically the same as the\r\ncorresponding regions of the forefoot.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

This classification is based on the degree to which the\r\ndisease interferes or may interfere with the work that the animal is called\r\non to perform. Unsoundnesses interfere with the use of the part or the use\r\nof the animal for a certain work; blemishes do not. Such a basis for the\r\nclassification of diseases does not enable us to place certain diseased\r\nconditions of the limbs in the unsound, or the blemish class at all times.\r\nA curb may, if it produces lameness, be classed as an unsoundness. If it\r\ndoes not cause the animal to go lame, and the enlargement on the posterior\r\nborder of the hock is small, it is classed as a blemish. A high splint may\r\nplace the animal in the unsound class, but usually a low splint is not\r\nconsidered a serious blemish. This classification is based to a certain\r\nextent on the relative economic importance of the disease, or the influence\r\nthat the disease may have on the value of the animal, as well as any\r\ninterference with the animal's ability to work.\r\n\r\nRECOGNITION OF THE DISEASE.--The seat of the disease may be in a muscle,\r\ntendon, bone or ligament. The general symptom manifested is lameness or\r\npain. The local symptoms are heat, pain, swelling and bony enlargements.\r\nThe degree of lameness and the character of the local lesions vary greatly\r\nin the different cases. When the animal shows a slight lameness and there\r\nis little evidence of any local symptom, it requires the services of a\r\nskilled and experienced person to locate the diseased part. When the part\r\nshows local lesions of disease and the lameness is characteristic,\r\ndiagnosis is not difficult.\r\n\r\nTHE EXAMINATION should be made while the animal is at rest; while standing\r\nin the stall and on level ground; when moved at a walk, or a slow trot on\r\nsoft ground, or a hard roadway; and when moved out after resting a few\r\nhours. While examining the animal under the different conditions mentioned,\r\nthe examiner must be careful and not pass over any part of a limb without\r\ndetermining whether it is normal or not. He should note any abnormal\r\nposition that the animal may take while standing at rest. Every movement\r\nshould be watched closely, as the manner of favoring the part may\r\ncharacterize the lameness. Negative symptoms of lameness in a part may at\r\ntimes prove as valuable in forming a diagnosis as positive symptoms.\r\n\r\nThe resting of either of the front feet, when the horse is standing at\r\nease, indicates that there is some soreness in the rested limb. _Pointing_\r\nor placing one or both feet well in front of the line of support, when the\r\nanimal is standing, usually indicates a diseased condition of the feet. It\r\nis natural for a horse that is standing in a stall to rest the hindfeet\r\nalternately. When the hindfoot is rested because of a soreness in some\r\nportion of the limb, it may be flexed or extended, the weight rested on the\r\ntoe, and the foot flexed and bearing practically no weight. In serious\r\ninflammation of the front feet, both feet may be placed well in front of\r\nthe normal position, and the hindfeet well under the body.\r\n\r\nWHEN EXAMINING A HORSE, the blanket or harness should be removed. The horse\r\nshould have on an open bridle or halter, and the attendant should give it\r\nas much freedom of the head as possible. The examiner should examine each\r\nlimb carefully and note any symptom of disease that may be present. The\r\nattendant should walk the animal straight away from the person making the\r\nexamination, toward, and past him, so that the animal's movements can be\r\nobserved from both sides, from behind and in front. This examination should\r\nbe repeated with the horse at a slow trot.\r\n\r\nThe character of the lameness may enable us to locate the seat of the\r\ndisease. We must first determine in which limb the animal is lame. This\r\npart of the diagnosis is not difficult. The pain suffered every time weight\r\nis thrown on the diseased limb causes the horse to step quickly and shift\r\nas much of the body weight as possible on the well foot. The foot of the\r\nlame limb is jerked up rather quickly after weight is thrown on it. This\r\nfavoring of the part varies in the different diseases. When the foot of the\r\nsound limb comes to the ground, more weight than common is placed on it. If\r\nthe seat of the lameness is in a front limb, there is a decided nodding or\r\nmovement of the head downward when the weight is placed on the well foot.\r\nIf both forefeet are diseased, the animal steps shorter and more quickly\r\nthan common. Lameness in a hind limb is characterized by more or less\r\ndropping of the quarter of the well limb when weight is thrown on it, and\r\nsometimes by a \"hitch\" or elevation of the quarter of the diseased limb\r\nwhen it is carried forward.\r\n\r\nUnless there are _local symptoms of disease_ present, it may be quite\r\ndifficult to locate the seat of lameness. Sometimes local symptoms are\r\nmisleading. After the lameness has been located in a certain limb, its\r\nmovement must be carefully noted in order to detect the part favored. If\r\nthe lameness is not characteristic enough to enable the examiner to locate\r\nthe seat of it, it is then necessary to put the animal through some\r\nmovement that may emphasize the soreness in the part. The animal may show a\r\ncertain reluctance to throw weight on the limb when turned to the right or\r\nleft. Moving the horse in a small circle with the lame limb on the outside\r\nmay cause the animal to use the muscles of the shoulder more freely, and\r\nemphasize any soreness that may be present. If the lame limb is on the\r\ninside, soreness anywhere in the foot may be increased, because of the\r\nextra weight thrown on this portion of the limb. Moving the animal over a\r\nhard driveway may increase the pain resulting from an inflammation of the\r\nfeet. Causing the animal to trot on soft ground, step over high objects,\r\nflexing, extending, abducting and adducting the part may enable the\r\nexaminer to locate the exact group of shoulder or arm muscles involved by\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nIN EXAMINING THE FEET it may be necessary to remove the shoes and practise\r\npercussion and pressure over the region of the sole. In some forms of\r\nlameness it may be necessary to destroy the sensation in the foot by\r\ninjecting cocaine along the course of the nerves that supply the foot\r\nbefore arriving at a definite diagnosis.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Define the term unsoundness and give an example.\r\n\r\n2. Define the term blemish and give an example.\r\n\r\n3. Give the general method of examining a horse for soundness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE FORE-LIMB\r\n\r\n\r\nSPRAINS AND INJURIES IN THE REGION OF THE SHOULDER.--Sprains and injuries\r\nof the structures in the shoulder region are more common in horses that are\r\ncalled on to do heavy work than among driving horses.\r\n\r\nThe following _causes_ may be mentioned: Ill-fitting collars, pulling heavy\r\nloads over uneven streets or soft ground, where the footing is not secure,\r\nand slipping are common causes. Young horses that do not know how to pull,\r\nor horses that are tired out by hard work, are predisposed to muscular\r\nstrain, and are apt to suffer injury if forced to do heavy work. Sore\r\nshoulders, or an ignorant driver, may cause the animal to pull awkwardly\r\nand throw more strain on certain groups of muscles than they can stand.\r\nRheumatism frequently causes shoulder lameness. The muscle usually affected\r\nby rheumatism is the large muscle extending from the region of the point of\r\nthe shoulder to the summit of the head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Shoulder lameness.]\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ of shoulder lameness vary in the different cases. The horse\r\nmay walk without going lame, but when made to trot lameness is quite\r\nnoticeable. The animal may point with the foot of the diseased limb,\r\nholding it forward, but squarely on the floor. In severe strain, little\r\nweight is thrown on the limb and the lameness is marked (Fig. 31). In\r\n\"shoulder slip\" the head of the arm bone pushes outward every time the\r\nanimal throws weight on the limb. This luxation can be noticed best when\r\nstanding in front of the animal. Marked atrophy of the external shoulder\r\nmuscles may occur. Such atrophy may appear and disappear quickly, and may\r\nresult from an injury to the nerve supply of the muscle as well as from\r\nfavoring the part. Atrophy of the shoulder may occur if the animal is lame\r\nin other regions of the limb, especially the feet. The outcome of shoulder\r\nlameness is favorable if the disease causing it is given prompt treatment.\r\n\r\n_Rest_ is a very important part of the _treatment_. It may be advisable to\r\nrestrict the horse's movements by placing it in a single stall, and tying\r\nthe animal so that it can not lie down. This should be continued for at\r\nleast one week. If the horse is restless, it should be given a box-stall or\r\nturned out in a small lot alone. It should be watered and fed in the\r\nquarters where confined. The _local treatment_ consists in applying mild\r\nliniments or blisters to the shoulder. It is not advisable, however, to\r\napply a blister if the muscles feel hot and tender.\r\n\r\nCAPPED ELBOW, \"SHOE-BOIL.\"--Capped elbow is an inflammation of the bursa at\r\nthe posterior surface of the elbow (Fig. 32). The swelling that results is\r\nusually sharply defined. It may feel abnormally warm and doughy, and it may\r\nbe painful. Later, the enlargement may be well defined and hard. Sometimes\r\nthe skin is indurated and lies in folds, or the shoe-boil shows abrasions\r\non its surface and fistulous openings leading from abscess centres. The\r\ncystic or soft tumor is a common form. Such an enlargement fluctuates on\r\npressure, and when opened, a blood-stained fluid escapes. All forms of\r\ncapped elbow tend to become chronic.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both preventive and local. As capped elbow is caused by\r\nbruising the part with the hoof or heel of the shoe, the preventive\r\ntreatment consists in hindering the animal from taking a position that may\r\nfavor injury to the part. Confining the animal in a small stall and tying\r\nit with too short a halter strap favors a sternal position when lying down.\r\nA roomy stall that permits the animal to stretch or change position is an\r\nimportant preventive measure. Shoes that project beyond the quarters should\r\nbe avoided. The elbow may be protected by placing a thick pad over the\r\nheels when the animal is in the stable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Shoe-boil.]\r\n\r\n_Local treatment_ varies according to the character of the enlargement.\r\nSoft, doughy swellings may be treated by application of cold, iodine and\r\nblisters. The cystic form of tumor must be opened, the fluid removed and\r\nthe lining membrane destroyed by the injection of tincture of iodine. Hard,\r\nindurated shoe-boils may be treated by completely removing the diseased\r\ntissue. The surgical treatment of capped elbow requires the service of an\r\nexperienced veterinarian. His efforts may prove a complete failure, unless\r\nthe irritation to the part by the shoe or hoof is prevented.\r\n\r\nINJURIES TO THE KNEE (BROKEN KNEE).--Horses frequently fall and bruise or\r\nlacerate the knee when moving at trot or canter. The injury varies\r\naccording to the force of the fall, and the character of the road that the\r\nanimal is travelling over. Some individuals are more liable to suffer from\r\nthis class of injuries than others. Horses that are weak-kneed because of\r\npoor conformation, or knee-sprung, are inclined to stumble. Careless\r\ndriving, especially if the animal is tired, predisposes it to this class of\r\ninjury. Because of the predisposition toward stumbling on the part of some\r\nhorses, scars on the front of the knee are termed broken knee, and the\r\nanimal is considered unsound.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ vary with the extent of the injury. Slight bruises or\r\nabrasions result in local swelling and soreness that disappear within a few\r\ndays. Laceration of skin interferes with the movement of the knee and the\r\nanimal may be quite lame. The part becomes swollen and painful. In injuries\r\ninvolving the sheaths of the tendons and the synovial membrane, the pain is\r\nsevere and the accompanying inflammation may take on a serious form.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ should not be overlooked. Horses should be\r\ntrained to carry the head at a proper height when moving. The driver should\r\nhandle the reins properly and keep his attention on the horse or horses\r\nthat he is driving. Superficial bruises require no special treatment other\r\nthan rest. Laceration of the skin and underlying tissue requires complete\r\nrest and careful removal of any particles, of dirt and gravel that may be\r\npresent in the wound. Shreds of tissue that may take no part in the healing\r\nshould be cut away. The hair in the region of the wound should be trimmed\r\nshort. Careful and repeated dressings with antiseptics are necessary until\r\nthe inflammation has largely disappeared and healing is rapidly taking\r\nplace. It may be advisable to tie the horse in the stall so that it can not\r\nlie down.\r\n\r\nDISTENDED SYNOVIAL SACS, JOINT SHEATHS AND BURSAE, \"GALLS.\"--Soft\r\nenlargements may occur in the region of the knee and fetlock. They are\r\ncommonly termed \"galls,\" \"wind-galls,\" or \"road-puffs.\" They are usually\r\ndue to the sheaths surrounding the tendons becoming distended with synovia.\r\n\"Galls\" are caused by strains, direct injury to the part and severe,\r\ncontinuous work. Certain individuals may develop this class of blemishes\r\nwithout being subject to any unusual conditions. This condition is seldom\r\naccompanied by lameness.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ may vary in the different cases. If the distended sheath,\r\nor bursal enlargement, is caused by a direct injury or strain, cold\r\nbandages should be applied and the part given as complete rest as possible.\r\n\"Wind-galls\" may be removed by a surgical operation. It is not advisable to\r\nattempt the removal of \"road-puffs.\" Rest, stimulating leg washes and\r\nbandages may temporarily remove the latter.\r\n\r\nSPRUNG KNEES (BUCK KNEES).--This condition of the knee is characterized by\r\nthe partly flexed condition of the region. It is best observed by standing\r\nto one side of the horse (Fig. 33). Instead of the forearm and cannon\r\nregions appearing perpendicular or in line, they are directed forward. This\r\ncondition may exist in varying degrees. Some individuals show it to a\r\nslight degree, the condition being accompanied by a weakness or shakiness\r\nof the knee when standing at rest. Sometimes, but one knee is involved.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ of this unsoundness are hereditary and accidental. Weak knees\r\ndue to faulty conformation seldom escape becoming sprung in animals that\r\nare given hard work. Severe and continuous driving is a common factor in\r\nthe production of this condition. Strains of the flexor muscles of the\r\nregion may cause it. The retraction of the flexor muscles and their tendons\r\nand the aponeurosis of the antibrachial region occurs in this disorder and\r\nprevents the animal from extending the knee.\r\n\r\nThe region is greatly weakened by this condition and the animal may be\r\nunfitted for active work. For this reason the value of the animal is\r\ngreatly diminished.\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ is unsatisfactory. The preventive treatment consists in not\r\nbreeding animals that have poorly conformed knees and using the proper\r\njudgment in working young horses and when driving or riding horses. Certain\r\ncases may be greatly benefited by sectioning the tendons of the external\r\nand middle flexors of the metacarpi. To insure a successful outcome in any\r\ncase that is operated on, a long period of rest is required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Sprung knees.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Splints.]\r\n\r\nSPLINTS.--A splint is a bony enlargement situated along the line of\r\narticulation between the splint and cannon bones (Fig. 34). This blemish is\r\ndue to an inflammation of the periosteum. It is a very common blemish and\r\nis generally located along the splint bones of the forefeet, especially the\r\ninternal ones.\r\n\r\n_Splints are caused_ by strains and rupture of the ligament that binds the\r\nsplint bone to the cannon bone. The result is an inflammation of the\r\nperiosteum. Slipping, or an unbalanced condition of the foot, may cause\r\nthis injury by distributing the weight unequally on the splint bones.\r\nFaulty action and bad shoeing may cause the horse to strike and bruise the\r\nregion.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of lameness_ are not always present. A high splint involving the\r\narticulation between the lower row of carpal, splint and cannon bones may\r\nbe considered an unsoundness, because of the persistent character of the\r\nlameness. The animal may show little or no lameness when walked, but if\r\nmoved at a trot, especially over a hard roadway, it may show marked\r\nlameness. The local inflammation is characterized by a small swelling lying\r\nalong the splint bone, that feels hot and may pit on pressure. After a time\r\nthe inflammation disappears and is replaced by a hard, bony enlargement.\r\nWhen this occurs the lameness disappears.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in keeping the feet of young horses in\r\nproper balance by frequent trimming and proper shoeing. This attention is\r\nvery necessary in young colts that are running in pasture. It is very\r\nadvisable to rest the animal during the period of inflammation. Cold\r\nbandages should be applied. As soon as the inflammation has subsided mild\r\ncounterirritants and absorbents may be used. In. case the lameness\r\npersists, more severe counterirritation is indicated.\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE FLEXOR TENDONS OF THE DIGIT.--The large tendons\r\nposterior to the foot and the suspensory ligament that separates them from\r\nthe cannon bone frequently become inflamed. Sometimes complete rupture of\r\none or more of these structures occurs. The lighter breeds of horses are\r\nthe most frequent sufferers. Because of the greater strain thrown on the\r\ntendons of the forefeet, inflammation of these tendons is far more common\r\nthan it is in the hindfoot. Diseased conditions of the hind tendons are\r\nusually due to other causes than strain.\r\n\r\nThe following _predisposing_ and _accidental causes_ should be considered:\r\nWeak flexor tendons and heavy bodies predispose animals to inflammation of\r\nthe tendons and suspensory ligament; quality, not size, is the factor to\r\nconsider when judging the strength of a tendon; long, slender pasterns\r\nincrease the strain on these structures, and this mechanical strain is\r\nfurther increased by low heels and long toes; the character of the work and\r\nthe condition of the road that the animal travels over are important\r\nfactors to consider; trotting and running horses more often suffer from\r\ninjuries to tendons and ligaments than draft horses; travelling at a high\r\nrate of speed over an uneven road, slipping and catching the foot in a rut\r\nor car track, are common causes; bruises and wounds may result in the\r\ntendons becoming inflamed; inflammation of the tendinous sheaths and the\r\ntendons as well sometimes occurs in influenza.\r\n\r\n_Lameness_ is a prominent _symptom._ The pastern is held in a more upright\r\nposition than normal. When the animal is standing, the foot is rested on\r\nthe toe, and it may take advantage of any uneven place on which to rest the\r\nheel. In severe strains the local symptoms are quite prominent. The tendons\r\nmay be hot and swollen. Pressure may cause the animal pain. In chronic\r\ntendinitis the tendon may be thickened and rough or knotty. Pain is not a\r\nprominent symptom in this class of cases. Shortening of the inflamed tendon\r\nmay occur, causing the animal to knuckle over. Rupture of one or more of\r\nthe tendons and the suspensory ligament can be recognized by the abnormal\r\nextension of the pastern. If the ruptured tendon heals, it always results\r\nin a thickening at the point of the rupture that gives the tendons a bowed\r\nappearance. This is termed bowed-tendon.\r\n\r\nThe lameness resulting from an inflammation of tendons resembles that\r\nresulting from strains and injuries to the fetlock joint, especially in the\r\nregion of the sesamoid bones.\r\n\r\nINFLAMMATION OF THE SESAMOID BONES differs slightly from the former.\r\nPressure over the posterior region of the fetlock may cause the animal\r\npain. The lameness shows a tendency to disappear with rest and reappear\r\nwhen the animal is again worked. Lameness is most prominent in some cases\r\nwhen the animal is first moved out. There may be a lack of local symptoms,\r\nsuch as heat and swelling. It is not uncommon for a bony enlargement to\r\nform on the sesamoid bone after a few months or a year.\r\n\r\nThe following _treatment_ is recommended. Horses that have a poor quality\r\nof tendon and weak fetlocks and pasterns should not be used for breeding\r\npurposes. Careful driving would prevent a large percentage of injuries to\r\ntendons. The most important treatment for all injuries due to strains is\r\nrest. In all cases of severe strain to the structures in this region, it is\r\nvery advisable to apply a plaster bandage. This should be left on for at\r\nleast two weeks. When the acute inflammation has subsided, counterirritants\r\nmay be applied. Either cold or hot applications are recommended. Cold\r\napplications are to be preferred at the beginning of the inflammation.\r\nCovering the tendons with a cold bandage, or with a heavy layer of\r\nantiphlogistin, is recommended. The horse should not be worked until after\r\nthe tendons have had an opportunity to completely recover from the\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nCONTRACTED TENDONS, KNUCKLING-OVER.--New-born foals are sometimes unable to\r\nstand on their front feet because of the excessive knuckling-over. The colt\r\nmay walk on the front of the pastern and fetlock. This sometimes results in\r\nsevere injury to the skin and the underlying tissues.\r\n\r\nKnuckling-over in the mature horse is not always due to contracted tendons.\r\nIt may occur as a symptom of inflammation of the flexor tendons, ligaments\r\nof the fetlock joint and the articulation as well. It may be noticed in\r\nanimals that have ring-bone, or coffin-joint lameness.\r\n\r\nThe most _common cause_ for this unsoundness is inflammation of the muscles\r\nand tendons of the flexors of the digit. As a result of long standing or\r\nsevere inflammation, shortening of these structures occurs in consequence\r\nof the contraction of the inflammatory or cicatricial tissue.\r\nKnuckling-over in the newborn colt is commonly caused by a weakness or lack\r\nof innervation of the extensor muscle of the digit. Judging from the quick\r\nrecovery that usually occurs, other causes for this condition are seldom\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ recommended for the new-born colt is supporting the fetlock\r\nwith a light plaster bandage. This should be applied very soon after birth\r\nin order to prevent bruising of the fetlock. A light cheese-cloth bandage\r\nshould be applied to the limb from the hoof to the knee. The colt is laid\r\non its side, the toe extended as much as possible, and the plaster bandage\r\napplied. This should be removed in about one week and fresh bandages\r\napplied. In about two weeks the young animal is usually able to walk on the\r\ntoe. As soon as it is able to do this a bandage is unnecessary. It is not\r\nadvisable to turn the colt outside if there is any chance for the bandages\r\nto become wet.\r\n\r\nKnuckling-over due to faulty conformation is difficult to correct. Light\r\nwork and careful shoeing are the most valuable preventive measures in young\r\nhorses. Sprains and injuries to the region of the fetlock should receive\r\nthe necessary treatment. The treatment for contracted tendon is largely\r\nsurgical and consists in sectioning it.\r\n\r\nINJURIES CAUSED BY INTERFERING.--Horses that have faulty action may strike\r\nthe opposite fetlock with the moving foot, the inside of the opposite limb\r\nin the region of the knee, and the quarters of the front foot with the shoe\r\nof the hindfoot. It is very common for horses to \"brush\" the inside of the\r\nhind fetlock with the opposite foot when trotting, especially if tired.\r\nInterfering in the front feet is less common. Striking the inside of the\r\nregion of the knee with the opposite foot or \"_speedy cutting_\" occurs in\r\ndriving and speed horses. Both of the latter forms of interfering may be\r\nconsidered unsoundnesses.\r\n\r\nThe most _common cause_ of interfering is faulty conformation, such as\r\nnarrowness of the chest or pelvis, faulty conformation of the limbs and\r\nirregularity in the action of the joints. Shoeing and the condition of the\r\nfeet are also important factors. Animals that have a narrow chest or pelvis\r\ninterfere because the legs are placed too closely together. Turning in of\r\nthe knees or \"knock-kneed,\" winging in or out of the feet, or any other\r\ndefective conformation of the limbs that tends to prevent the animal from\r\nmoving the feet in line, lead to serious interfering. A wide-spreading\r\nhoof, an unbalanced condition of the foot and improper fitting of the shoes\r\nare common causes for interfering in horses that would otherwise move the\r\nfeet in line. Debility from disease and overwork may cause the animal to\r\ninterfere temporarily. An unbalanced gait and shortness of the body are the\r\ncommon causes for injuries to the quarters.\r\n\r\nAll degrees of injury to the part struck by the shoe or wall of the foot\r\nmay be noted. Horses that interfere lightly, wear the hair off and produce\r\nslight abrasions of the skin on the inside of the fetlock. Sometimes the\r\nskin is bruised, inflamed or scarred. Injuries to the inside of the knee\r\nand quarter are the most serious. Lameness, inflammation of the periosteum\r\nand bony enlargement may result from \"speedy cutting.\" Deep wounds in the\r\nregion of the heel or quarter may occur when a horse strikes this part with\r\nthe shoe of the hindfoot in moving at a high rate of speed.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is largely preventive. No doubt many cases of interfering\r\ncould be prevented by careful training and balancing of the foot when the\r\nanimal is growing and developing. The feet of colts should be trimmed every\r\nthree or four weeks. Interfering in the hindfeet may be stopped by noting\r\nthe character of the animal's gait and the portion of the wall that strikes\r\nthe part, and by practising intelligent methods of shoeing. Slight injuries\r\nshould be treated by the application of antiseptic powders. The treatment\r\nfor injuries to the periosteum is the same as that recommended for splints.\r\nAs a last resort boots and button rings may be used for the purpose of\r\npreventing serious injury to that part which is struck by the foot.\r\n\r\nRING-BONE.--Chronic inflammation of the articulation between the first and\r\nsecond bones of the digit is termed ring-bone (Fig. 35). Not all ring-bones\r\ninvolve the articular surfaces. The periarticular, or false ring-bone, is a\r\nchronic inflammation of the bone near the articular surface. The bony\r\nenlargement varies in size. It may form a ring encircling the part, or it\r\nmay be limited to the lateral surface of the joint. The bony enlargement\r\nmay be so small as to be detected only by a careful examination. Ring-bone\r\nmay occur on any of the feet, but it is said to be more common in the front\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Bones of digit, showing side bones and ring-bones,\r\nand normal bones of digit.]\r\n\r\n_The predisposing cause_ of ring-bone is faulty conformation. Long, weak\r\npasterns that are predisposed to strains, upright pasterns, especially if\r\nsmall, and exposed to concussion and jarring, and crooked feet that\r\ndistribute the weight on the part irregularly are important factors in the\r\nproduction of ring-bones. The _external causes_ are sprains or any injury\r\nto the region. _Lameness_ is nearly always present. The degree of lameness\r\nvaries, and does not depend altogether on the size of the bony enlargement.\r\nLarge ring-bones interfere with the movement of the tendon. Lameness is\r\nmost pronounced when weight is thrown on one foot, the later phase of the\r\nstep being shortened and the pastern more upright. Some cases improve with\r\nrest, but the lameness returns when the animal is given hard work.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in giving the necessary attention to\r\nthe feet of young animals, by trimming the wall frequently and keeping the\r\nfeet in balance and the careful selection of breeding stock. Resting the\r\nanimal, keeping the foot that has the ring-bone on it in proper balance and\r\ncounterirritation by means of blisters and cautery (searing) are important\r\nlines of treatment. Shortening the toe and raising the heel, if necessary,\r\ngreatly relieves the lameness in some cases. Sectioning the sensory nerves\r\nthat go to the part should not be practised, unless in exceptional cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n 1.

It may be\r\ndivided into three parts, the insensitive and sensitive structures and the\r\nbony core. The _insensitive foot_ or _hoof_ is divided into wall, sole,\r\nfrog and bars. The _sensitive foot_ is divided into vascular tissue and\r\nelastic apparatus. The vascular tissue is in turn divided into coronary\r\ncushion, laminae and velvety tissue. The elastic apparatus is divided into\r\nplantar cushion and fibro-cartilages. The _bony core_ is formed by the\r\nnavicular and third digital bones. The hoof and vascular tissue in turn\r\nenclose the elastic apparatus and bony core.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Photograph of a model of the foot: wall; sensitive\r\ntissue; plantar cushion, inferior dark portion, sole and frog; lateral\r\ncartilage; and pedal bone.]\r\n\r\nTHE WALL forms that portion of the hoof seen when the foot rests on the\r\nground (Fig. 37). It is covered by a thin layer of horny tissue, the\r\n_peripole,_ that coats over the wall and assists in preventing its drying\r\nout. On lifting the foot and examining its inferior surface, it is noticed\r\nthat the wall at the heels is inflected under the foot and in a forward\r\ndirection. This portion of the wall is termed the _bars._ Within the\r\nbearing margin of the wall and in front of the bars is a thick, concave,\r\nhorny plate that forms the _sole._ At the heels and between the bars is a\r\nwedge-shaped mass of rather soft horny tissue that projects forward into\r\nthe sole. This is the _foot pad_ or _horny frog._ It is divided into two\r\nlateral portions by a medium cleft.\r\n\r\nTHE CORONARY CUSHION projects into the upper border of the wall. It is\r\ncovered with vascular papillae which secrete the horny fibres that form the\r\nwall. The _vascular laminae_ are leaf-like projections, the sides of which\r\nare covered by secondary leaves. _Horny laminae_, arranged the same as\r\nvascular laminae, line the wall. These two structures are so firmly united\r\nthat it is impossible to tear them apart without destroying the tissue. The\r\n_velvety tissue_ covers all of the inferior surface of the foot, with the\r\nexception of the bars. As the name indicates, its surface is covered by\r\nvascular papillae that resemble the ply on velvet. It is firmly united to\r\nthe horny sole which it secretes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Foot showing neglect in trimming wall.]\r\n\r\nThe lateral cartilages are attached to the posterior angles of the pedal\r\nbone. They are flattened from side to side, and the portion that projects\r\nabove the coronary cushion may be felt by pressing on the skin that covers\r\nit. The _plantar cushion_ is a wedge-shaped piece of tissue formed by\r\ninterlacing connective-tissue fibres and fat. It is limited on each side by\r\nthe lateral cartilages. Its inferior face is moulded to the frog.\r\n\r\nTHE BONY CORE formed by the last bone of the digit and the coffin bone was\r\ndescribed briefly with the other foot bones. A very important bursa,\r\nbecause it is so frequently inflamed in coffin-joint lameness, facilitates\r\nthe gliding of the flexor tendon over the navicular bone before it becomes\r\nattached to the inferior face of the pedal or digital bone.\r\n\r\nSIDE-BONES.--This is a chronic inflammation of the lateral cartilages of\r\nthe foot that results in their ossification (Fig. 38). This unsoundness is\r\ncommon in heavy horses, especially if worked on city streets. The\r\ninflammation affects the cartilages of the front feet, rarely those of the\r\nhindfeet.\r\n\r\n_The hereditary tendency_ toward the development of side-bones is an\r\nimportant predisposing factor. It is not uncommon to meet with this\r\nunsoundness in young horses that have never been worked. Low, weak heels,\r\nflat, spreading feet, or any other faulty conformation of the foot are\r\npredisposing factors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--A very large side bone.]\r\n\r\nThe character of the work is an important _exciting cause._ Continuous work\r\nover paved streets, especially if the horse is shod with high-heeled shoes,\r\nincreases the shock received by the elastic apparatus of the foot. This\r\nproduces more or less irritation to the lateral cartilages, which may\r\nresult in their complete ossification. Punctured wounds in the regions of\r\nthe cartilage may cause it to become inflamed and changed to bone.\r\n\r\nThe following _symptoms_ may be noted. Farm horses that have side-bones\r\nseldom show lameness. This is because they are worked on soft ground and\r\nnot on a hard street or road. Driving and dray horses may step short with\r\nthe front feet, or show a stilty action. This may disappear with exercise.\r\nThe lameness is sometimes marked. The local diseased changes are the\r\ngreatest help in the recognition of side-bones. Horses should not be passed\r\nas sound without making a careful examination of the lateral cartilages.\r\nThis examination is made by pressure over the region of the cartilage with\r\nthe thumb or fingers. This is for the purpose of testing its elasticity. If\r\nit feels rigid and rough, the cartilaginous tissue has been replaced by\r\nbony tissue, and the animal should be classed as unsound.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is largely preventive. Horses with side-bones should not be\r\nbred. It is not advisable to use horses with side-bones on the road or city\r\nstreets. Shoeing with rubber pads may help in overcoming the concussion and\r\nrelieve the lameness. Sectioning the sensory nerves going to this portion\r\nof the foot is advisable in driving horses. Rest and counterirritation\r\nrelieve the lameness for a short time.\r\n\r\nNAVICULAR DISEASE.--In navicular disease the bursa, flexor tendon, and\r\nnavicular bone may become chronically inflamed. Because of the seat of the\r\nlameness, it is commonly known as \"coffin-joint\" lameness. This disease\r\naffects standard and thoroughbred horses more often than it does the\r\ncoarser breeds. One or both front feet may be affected (Fig. 39).\r\n\r\n_Hereditary causes_ are largely responsible for navicular disease. The\r\ntendency toward this disease probably depends on such peculiarities of\r\nconformation as narrow, weak, high heels, long pasterns and too long a toe.\r\nThe character of the work is an important factor. Hurried, rapid movements\r\nthrow considerable strain on the navicular region, increasing the danger\r\nfrom injury. This is, no doubt, one reason for \"coffin-joint\" lameness\r\nbeing more common in driving and speed horses than in slow-going work\r\nanimals. Rheumatic inflammation, bad shoeing and punctured wounds in the\r\nregion of the bursa many cause it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--A case of navicular disease involving one front\r\nfoot. The diseased foot is the smaller.]\r\n\r\nThe _first symptom_ usually noted is a tendency to stumble. When standing\r\nin the stable, the animal \"points\" or rests the diseased foot. Sometimes it\r\nrests the heel of the lame foot on the wall of the opposite foot. If both\r\nfeet are affected, the animal may rest them alternately, or take a position\r\nwith both feet well in front of the normal position. The inflamed\r\nstructures are so covered by other tissues that it is difficult to detect\r\nthe local inflammation, or cause the animal to flinch by applying pressure\r\nover the region. As the disease becomes more advanced, the lameness becomes\r\npermanent. The limb is carried forward stiffly and rapidly and the animal\r\nstumbles when travelling over rough ground. In time, because of the little\r\nweight thrown on the posterior portion of the foot, the quarters may become\r\nhigher, contracted and more upright and the frog smaller. If one foot is\r\ndiseased, it becomes smaller than the opposite foot.\r\n\r\nThe following _preventive measures_ may be recommended. We should not use\r\nanimals having faulty conformation of the feet for breeding, because the\r\noffspring of such individuals have an inherent tendency toward navicular\r\nand other foot diseases. Animals that have \"coffin-joint\" lameness should\r\nbe allowed to run in pasture as much as possible, because natural\r\nconditions help to keep down the inflammation and soreness and promote a\r\nmore healthy condition of the foot. In shoeing the horse it is best to\r\nshorten the toe and raise the heel. It is advisable in the more favorable\r\ncases to cut the sensory nerves of the foot. This operation destroys the\r\nsensation in the foot, and should not be performed on feet with weak heels,\r\nor that are wide or spreading.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--An improperly shod foot; note the manner in which\r\nthe wall is cut away at the toe.]\r\n\r\nCONTRACTED QUARTERS.--This condition of the feet is characterized by the\r\nfoot becoming narrow in its posterior portion. One or both of the quarters\r\nmay be affected. It is principally observed in the forefeet.\r\n\r\nThe _causes_ of contraction of the foot may be classed as _predisposing_,\r\n_secondary_ and _exciting_. It may accompany chronic diseases of the foot,\r\nsuch as navicular disease and side-bones. Weak heels is the principal\r\npredisposing factor. Any condition that tends to prevent the hoof from\r\ntaking up moisture, or causes it to lose moisture, may cause the horn to\r\nlose flexibility and contract. This is one of the reasons why horses that\r\nare worked continuously in cities, or used for driving, frequently develop\r\ncontracted feet. Ill-fitting shoes, excessive rasping of the wall and bars,\r\nand allowing the shoes to stay on the foot for too long a time are\r\nresponsible to a very large degree for this disorder of the foot (Fig. 40).\r\n\r\nThe following _local symptoms_ may occur: The wall of the foot at the\r\nquarters may appear drawn in at its superior or inferior portion. Sometimes\r\none or both quarters are perpendicular, or nearly so. The foot then appears\r\ntoo narrow at the heel, too elongated and less rounded than normal. The\r\nchanges in the appearance of the inferior surface of the hoof vary. The\r\nchanges here may be so slight that they are not noticed. In well advanced\r\nand neglected cases the arch of the sole is increased, the frog is narrow\r\nand atrophied and the bars high and perpendicular. Corns may accompany the\r\ncontraction. The foot may feel feverish. The animal may manifest the pain\r\nin the feet when standing at rest by pointing and changing their position.\r\nWhen lameness is present, it may resemble that occurring in inflammation of\r\nlateral cartilages and navicular disease.\r\n\r\n_Preventive treatment_ is of the greatest importance. This consists in\r\ngiving the feet an opportunity to take up moisture when they are exposed to\r\nabnormal conditions and become feverish. Under such conditions, it is\r\nadvisable to occasionally remove the shoes and turn the animal into a\r\npasture or lot. It is best to do this in the fall or winter when the ground\r\nis wet. If this can not be practised, the shoes should be removed and a\r\npoultice of ground flaxseed and bran, equal parts, applied to the feet for\r\na period of eight or ten hours, daily for a week or two. A plank trough six\r\ninches deep, two feet wide and as long as the stall is wide may be filled\r\nwith a stiff clay, and the horse made to stand with its front feet in the\r\nclay bath for ten or twelve hours daily. When grooming the horse, the foot\r\nshould be cleaned with a foot-hook and washed with clean water. Hoof\r\nointments should be avoided so far as possible. The importance of fitting\r\nthe shoe to the foot, avoiding the too free use of the rasp and hoof knife\r\nand resetting or changing the shoe when necessary can not be overestimated.\r\nShoeing the animal with a special shoe is sometimes necessary. It is not\r\nadvisable to attempt the forcible expansion of the quarters. Lowering the\r\nheels by careful trimming of the wall and sole and permitting frog pressure\r\nmay be all the special attention required.\r\n\r\nSAND-CRACK.--A fissure in the wall of the foot running in the same\r\ndirection as the horny fibres, or a seam in the wall resulting from the\r\nhealing of the fissure is termed sand-crack. The position and extent of the\r\nfissure or seam vary. It may involve the wall of the _toe_ (toe-crack)\r\n(Fig. 41) or _quarter_ (quarter-crack) (Fig. 42). It is _superficial_ or\r\n_deep_, according to the thickness of the wall involved; _complete_ or\r\n_incomplete_, depending on whether it extends from the bearing margin of\r\nthe wall to the coronary band or only a portion of the distance; _simple_,\r\nwhen the horny tissue only is involved; and _complicated_, when the\r\nsensitive tissue beneath becomes injured and inflamed. Cracks of long\r\nstanding usually have thick, rough margins.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ of this unsoundness are poor quality of horn, improper care\r\nand injuries. Sand-cracks commonly occur in hoofs that are dry and brittle\r\nand have thin walls. In young horses incomplete cracks due to the wall\r\nbecoming long and breaking off in large pieces are common. Unequal\r\ndistribution of weight, the result of unskilled shoeing, or any other\r\ncondition that may cause the foot to become unbalanced, using the foot rasp\r\ntoo freely, and such diseases as quittor, corns and contracted quarters\r\nsubject the animal to this form of unsoundness. Any injury to the coronary\r\ncushion that secretes the fibres of the horny wall may result in either\r\ntoe- or quarter-crack. Treads and barb-wire cuts are common injuries to the\r\nregion of the coronet.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in preserving a healthy condition of\r\nthe horn by giving the foot the necessary care and attention in the way of\r\nproper trimming and shoeing, and providing it with the necessary moisture\r\nby means of foot-baths, wet clay and poultices. Quarter-cracks respond to\r\ntreatment more quickly than toe-cracks. The treatment is practically the\r\nsame for both. This consists in preventing motion in the margins of the\r\nfissure so far as possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Toe-cracks.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Quarter-crack caused by barb-wire cut.]\r\n\r\n_The treatment for fissures_ in the region of the toe and quarter is as\r\nfollows: The wall should be cut away along the margins of the crack until\r\nit is quite thin; and extra nail holes should be made in the shoe, and a\r\nnail driven into the bearing margin of the wall a little to each side of\r\nthe fissure. The wall at the toe should be shortened and the toe of the\r\nshoe rolled if the animal's work permits the use of this kind of a shoe.\r\n\r\nThe margins of a quarter-crack and the wall just posterior and below it\r\nshould be cut away until quite thin. The bearing margin should then be\r\ntrimmed so that it does not rest on the shoe. A bar shoe that does not\r\npress on the frog may be used. Light blisters to the region of the coronet\r\nhelp in stimulating the growth of the horn. Rest is advisable.\r\n\r\nCORNS.--This term is applied to injuries to the foot caused by bruises or\r\ncontinuous pressure to the posterior portion of the sole. This condition is\r\ncommon in the forefeet.\r\n\r\n_The predisposing causes_ are faulty conformation that favors pressure from\r\nthe shoe on the sole between the bars and wall and weak heels. Corns are\r\ncommonly met with in feet having contracted quarters. The principal\r\n_external causes_ are wrong methods of shoeing and allowing the shoes to\r\nremain on the feet for too long a period.\r\n\r\n_A common symptom_ of corns is lameness. In order to relieve the pressure\r\nover the inflamed part, the animal stands with the foot slightly flexed at\r\nthe fetlock. The lameness is not characteristic. It is only by a local\r\nexamination of the foot, made by pressing on the sole or cutting away the\r\nhorn, that we are able to form a positive diagnosis.\r\n\r\nWe describe the _diseased changes_ by using the terms _dry_, _moist_ and\r\n_suppurative corns_. In the _dry corn_ we find the horn stained and\r\ninfiltrated with blood. In the _moist corn_ the hoof may be colored the\r\nsame as in the former, but in addition there is a space between the\r\nvascular and horny tissue that is filled with a serous-like fluid. If this\r\ncollection of fluid becomes infected with pus organisms and is changed to\r\npus, it is then termed a _suppurative corn_. Sometimes the pus pushes its\r\nway upward and backward between the sensitive laminae and the wall, and\r\nmakes its appearance at the margin of the coronary band in the region of\r\nthe quarters or heels. This usually occurs when the tissues beneath the\r\nhorny frog become bruised or the sensitive tissue pricked by a nail. It is\r\ncommonly termed \"gravelled.\" Pus rarely breaks through the thick horny\r\ntissue, but follows the wall and breaks through the skin where it meets\r\nwith the least resistance. Corns may be considered a serious unsoundness in\r\ndriving horses.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is largely preventive. Trimming the foot and fitting the\r\nshoe properly are important preventive measures. The practice of cutting\r\naway the bars and sole or \"opening up the heels,\" as it is commonly termed,\r\nshould be condemned. This method of trimming the foot instead of preventing\r\ncorns is a very common factor in producing them. The shoe should not be too\r\nshort or too narrow. It should follow the outline of the wall and rest\r\nevenly on its bearing margin. If this is practised, weakening the wall by\r\ncutting off that portion allowed to project beyond the shoe is unnecessary.\r\nFeet that have low heels and large, prominent frogs should be shod with\r\nshoes thick at the heels. The best line of treatment for a horse that is\r\nsubject to corns is to remove the shoes and allow the animal to run in a\r\npasture. If this is impossible, poulticing the feet or standing the animal\r\nin moist clay will help in relieving the soreness. Excessive cutting away\r\nof the horny sole is contra-indicated. Suppurative corns should be given\r\nproper drainage and treatment.\r\n\r\nLAMINITIS, \"FOUNDER.\"--This is an inflammation of the sensitive or vascular\r\nstricture of the foot. The inflammation may be acute, subacute or chronic.\r\nStockmen frequently use a classification for laminitis based on the causes.\r\nFeed, road and water founder are common terms used in speaking of this\r\ndisease. The inflammation is usually limited to the front feet.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ of laminitis are overfeeding, sudden changes in the feed,\r\ndrinking a large quantity of water when the animal is overheated,\r\noverexertion, exhaustion and chilling of the body by standing the animal in\r\na cold draft. It may be associated with such diseases as rheumatism,\r\ninfluenza and colic.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ vary in the different forms of the disease. Pain is the most\r\ncharacteristic symptom. The sensitive or vascular structure of the foot has\r\nan abundant supply of sensory nerves, and, as it is situated between the\r\nhoof and the bony core, the pressure and pain resulting from the\r\ninflammation are severe.\r\n\r\nIn the _acute form_ general symptoms are manifested. The appetite is\r\nimpaired, the body temperature elevated and the pulse beats and\r\nrespirations quickened. If the inflammation is severe, the animal prefers\r\nto lie down. This is especially true if all four feet are inflamed. In most\r\ncases the horse stands with the forefeet well forward and the hind feet in\r\nfront of their normal position and under the body. The affected feet are\r\nfeverish and very sensitive to jarring or pressure. Moving about increases\r\nthe pain in the feet, and it may be very difficult to make the animal step\r\nabout the stall.\r\n\r\nIn the _subacute form_ the symptoms are less severe. The irregularity in\r\nthe gait is especially noticeable when the animal is turned quickly. The\r\nlocal symptoms are less marked than in the acute form and the general\r\nsymptoms may be absent.\r\n\r\n_The chronic form_ is characterized by changes in the shape and appearance\r\nof the hoofs (Fig. 43). The wall shows prominent ridges or rings, the toe\r\nmay be concave, thick and long and the sole less arched than usual, or\r\nconvex. The degree of lameness varies. It is more noticeable when the horse\r\nis moved over a hard roadway than if moved over soft ground. One attack of\r\nlaminitis may predispose the animal to a second attack.\r\n\r\n_The prognosis_ depends on the character of the inflammation and the\r\npromptness and thoroughness of the treatment. Acute laminitis may respond\r\nto prompt, careful treatment in from ten to fourteen days. Subacute\r\nlaminitis responds readily to treatment. The prognosis is least favorable\r\nin the chronic form.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ is very important. Dietetic causes are\r\nresponsible for a large percentage of the cases of this disease. Horses\r\nthat are accustomed to being fed and watered at irregular periods and after\r\nsevere or unusual exercise seem to be able to stand this treatment better\r\nthan animals that are more carefully cared for, but even this class of\r\nanimals do not always escape injury. Stockmen should realize the danger of\r\nproducing an inflammation of the feet by feeding grain and giving cold\r\nwater to horses immediately after severe exercise. Overfeeding should also\r\nbe avoided. Careful nursing may prevent the occurrence of laminitis as a\r\ncomplication of other diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--This foot shows the changes in shape and\r\nappearance of wall and sole occurring in chronic laminitis.]\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ of the inflammation is as follows: The removal of the shoes\r\nand the necessary trimming of the foot should be practised early in the\r\ninflammation; the horse should be placed in a roomy box-stall that is well\r\nbedded with cut straw; during the cool weather it may be necessary to\r\nblanket the animal; if the weather is hot and the flies annoy the patient,\r\nthe stall should be darkened; in serious cases, and when the animal is\r\nheavy, it may be advisable to use a sling; hot water fomentations are to be\r\npreferred; the patient may be stood in a tub of hot water or heavy woollen\r\nbandages that have been dipped in hot water and wrung, out as dry as\r\npossible may be applied to the feet; the temperature of the water should be\r\nno hotter than can be comfortably borne with the hands; the results of this\r\ntreatment depend on the faithfulness with which it is carried out; a\r\npoultice of ground flaxseed should be applied to the foot at night, or\r\nduring the interval between the foot-baths. This treatment may be continued\r\nuntil the acute inflammation has subsided.\r\n\r\nIf the animal is inclined to eat, it should be fed very little roughness\r\nand grain. Soft feeds are to be preferred, and one quart of linseed oil\r\ngiven as a physic. After a period of from ten days to three weeks,\r\ndepending on the tenderness of the feet, the wall at the toe should be\r\nshortened, the sole trimmed if necessary, flat shoes rolled at the toe\r\nplaced on the feet, and the animal allowed to exercise a short time each\r\nday in a lot or pasture. As the hoof grows rapidly, it is necessary to trim\r\nit carefully every three or four weeks and replace the shoes. The wall at\r\nthe toe should be kept short, but excessive thinning of the sole should be\r\navoided.\r\n\r\nThe same line of treatment as recommended for the horse may be used for\r\nlaminitis in cattle. If marked diseased changes occur in the feet, it is\r\nnot advisable to attempt the treatment of chronic laminitis, unless it is\r\nin valuable breeding animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

Such\r\nfractures are due to accidental causes, as striking the point of the haunch\r\non the door frame when hurrying through a narrow doorway and falling on\r\nfrozen ground.\r\n\r\nFractures of the _external angle_ of the ileum or point of haunch are\r\nusually followed by displacement of the fractured portion. The same is true\r\nof fractures of the _neck of the ileum_. The result is a deformity of the\r\nquarter.\r\n\r\nIn making an _examination_ of these parts the examiner should see that the\r\nhorse is standing squarely on its feet, and then compare the conformation\r\nof the two quarters. Fractures of either the external angle or the neck of\r\nthe ileum cause the quarter to appear narrow and low. A close examination\r\nmay enable the examiner to differentiate between the two fractures.\r\nFractures of the neck of the ileum can be recognized by manipulating the\r\npart through the walls of the rectum or vagina.\r\n\r\nThe degree of lameness may vary. In some cases there may be no lameness\r\nwhen the animal walks, but a slight degree of lameness may be noticed when\r\nit trots. For several weeks after the injury the horse may be unable to use\r\nthe limb, but it may eventually make nearly a complete recovery.\r\n\r\nAtrophy of the muscles of the hip or quarter (Fig. 44) should not be\r\nmistaken for fractures of the ileum. This condition involves the heavy\r\ngluteal muscles and may occur as a complication of azoturia, or a lameness\r\nof the hind limb that is usually due to a spavin.\r\n\r\nIt is very seldom necessary to give fractures of the ileum any special\r\ncare. If the animal is very lame, it should be given a narrow stall, and\r\nplaced in a sling until it can support its weight on the limb. The same\r\ntreatment is indicated in cattle. It is not advisable to breed a mare that\r\nhas had the ileum fractured. The bony enlargement that results from the\r\nunion of the broken ends of the bone may interfere with the passage of the\r\nfoetus through the pelvic cavity and cause difficult parturition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Atrophy of the muscles of the quarter.]\r\n\r\nLUXATION OF THE PATELLA, \"Stifle Out.\"--This is a common accident in horses\r\nand mules. Young, immature animals are more prone to displacement of the\r\npatella than when mature. The displacement is usually upward or outward.\r\nOutward displacement is comparatively rare.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ of \"stifle out\" may be described as follows: The patella or\r\nknee-cap rests on a pulley-like articular surface belonging to the inferior\r\nextremity of the thigh-bone. The external lip of this articular surface is\r\nsmaller than the internal lip. The patella is held in place from above by\r\nthe heavy muscles of the anterior region of the thigh, and from below, by\r\nstraight ligaments that attach it to the leg-bone. If the retaining\r\nstructures mentioned become relaxed, the patella may, when the limb is\r\nextended, become so displaced as to rest on the superior portion of the\r\nexternal lip. Laxness of the muscles and ligaments in young animals is a\r\npredisposing factor. Hard work that tires the muscles and causes them to\r\nbecome relaxed, strains, unusual movements, as kicking in the stable and\r\nslipping, may cause this accident. Congenital displacement results from\r\nimperfect development of the external lip of the trochlea. Such a deformity\r\nsubjects the animal to frequent luxations.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms may vary_. The displacement may be first noticed when the\r\nhorse is backed out of the stall or turned quickly. A slight \"hitch\" in the\r\nmovement of the limb is noted, that is followed by more noticeable flexion\r\nof the hock than normal. In case the luxation is more permanent, the horse\r\nstands quietly with the affected leg held stiffly and extended backward.\r\nWhen made to move forward, it hops on the well leg and carries the affected\r\none, or drags it on the toe. If both limbs are affected, the animal is\r\nunable to move. The inability to move the limb is due to the patella\r\nresting on the external lip of the pulley surface, and a locking of the\r\nstifle- and hock-joint.\r\n\r\nThis accident is annoying, and in case the horse is subject to it should be\r\nconsidered an unsoundness.\r\n\r\nThe following _treatment_ may be recommended: The luxation may be reduced\r\nin the large majority of cases by backing or turning the animal. If this\r\ndoes not reduce the displacement, a collar should be placed on the animal,\r\nand a hobble strap fastened to the pastern of the involved limb. One end of\r\na long rope is tied to the collar, passed backward between the front limbs,\r\nthrough a ring in the hobble and back over the outside of the shoulder and\r\nunder the collar. While an attendant pulls the limb a little forward with\r\nthe rope, the operator takes hold of the foot and attempts to flex the\r\nlimb, at the same time pushing inward on the patella. After reducing the\r\nluxation it is advisable to tie the rope to the collar, so that the limb is\r\ncarried forward. This prevents the animal from throwing weight on the foot.\r\nIt may be advisable to tie the animal so that it can not lie down, if the\r\nfoot is to be left hobbled for a few days. A fly blister should be applied\r\nto the front and outside of the stifle and the application repeated in two\r\nor three weeks.\r\n\r\nSTRING-HALT.--This term is applied to a peculiar involuntary movement of\r\none or both hind limbs that is characterized by a sudden, purposeless\r\nflexion of the hock-joint (Fig. 45). Horses that are slightly affected may\r\nshow this movement of the hind limbs when first exercised. Other horses may\r\nbe \"string-halted\" when backed, turned, walked, or trotted, and fail to\r\ndrive out of it. The cause of true \"string-halt\" is not known.\r\n\r\n_The treatment recommended is surgical._ This consists in cutting the\r\ntendon of the peroneus muscle. The seat of the operation is a little below\r\nthe hock and on the external face of the cannon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--String-halt.]\r\n\r\nSPAVIN.--A spavin is a chronic inflammation of the articular faces of the\r\nhock bones, ligaments and synovial membranes. The inflammation may result\r\nin the formation of a bony enlargement on the inner surface of the region,\r\nand a union between the small bones forming the lower portion of the hock,\r\nand the upper extremities of cannon and lower hock bones (Figs. 46 and 47).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--A large bone spavin.]\r\n\r\nThe _predisposing causes_ are of the greatest importance. A spavin is one\r\nof the unsoundnesses of horses that may be transmitted to the offspring.\r\nYoung colts that have heavy bodies and are fed a fattening ration are\r\npredisposed to it. Crooked hind limbs, small hocks and quarters that are\r\nheavily muscled are predisposing factors. The _external causes_ are strains\r\ncaused by slipping, turning quickly, rearing, pulling heavy loads and\r\nkicks. Horses three or four years of age if given work that favors hock\r\nstrain, such as excavating cellars, may develop a spavin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Normal cannon bone and cannon bone showing bony\r\nenlargement and lower hock bones united to superior extremity; this occurs\r\nin bone spavin.]\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ or lameness are more characteristic than in most diseases of\r\nthe limb. At the very beginning of the inflammation, and sometimes for\r\nseveral months afterward, the lameness is intermittent and disappears with\r\nexercise. After a time it is permanent. It is characterized by a stiffness\r\nof the hock. The extension of the hock is incomplete, the step is short and\r\nquick, the animal \"goes on its toe\" and the wall or shoe at the toe shows\r\nconsiderable wear. Because of the stiffness in the hock the animal raises\r\nthe quarter when the limb is carried forward. Turning toward the well side\r\nmay increase the lameness. The _spavin test_ may be of value in diagnosing\r\nlameness. This consists in picking up the foot and holding the hock in a\r\nflexed position for a few minutes. The foot is then dropped to the ground\r\nand the animal moved off at a brisk trot. If the lameness is more marked,\r\nit indicates that the seat is in the region of the hock. This test is of\r\ngreatest value in young animals. The bony enlargement can usually be seen\r\nbest if the examiner stands in front and to one side of the animal. The\r\nhock should be observed from directly behind as well. The hocks of both\r\nlimbs should be compared, and the general conformations of the other joints\r\nas well. This may prevent the examiner from mistaking rough hocks for\r\nspavin enlargements or \"a pair\" of spavins for rough hocks. A bony\r\nenlargement does not always accompany the lameness, and a spavin may be\r\npresent without the horse going noticeably lame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Bog spavins.]\r\n\r\n_The prognosis_ is always uncertain and should be guided somewhat by the\r\nconformation of the limb, character of the work required of the animal,\r\nposition of the bony enlargement and the degree of lameness. The size of\r\nthe enlargement is changed very little by the treatment. Veterinarians\r\nreport recoveries in from fifty to sixty per cent of the cases treated.\r\n\r\n_The object of the treatment_ is to destroy the inflammation and bring\r\nabout a union between the bones. The treatment recommended is\r\ncounterirritation and rest. The most satisfactory method of\r\ncounterirritation is firing followed by blistering. Following this\r\ntreatment, the horse should be placed in a stall and given no exercise for\r\na period of five or six weeks. It is sometimes advisable to repeat the\r\ncounterirritation if the results of the first firing are unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nBOG SPAVIN.--Bog spavin is an extensive distention of the capular ligament\r\nof the hock-joint by synovia (Fig. 48). It is generally due to chronic\r\ninflammation of the synovial membrane. This blemish or unsoundness is most\r\ncommon in young horses. Thorough pin (Fig. 49) involves the sheath of the\r\nlarge tendon only. (Compare Figs. 48 and 49.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Thorough pin. Note the relation of the enlargement\r\nto the tendon, and the freedom of the hocks from bog spavin.]\r\n\r\nCertain conformations of the hock favor the development of bog spavin. This\r\nis especially true of upright and \"fleshy\" hocks. Hard work may cause the\r\nhocks to \"fill\" when followed by a brief period of rest. The common cause\r\nis a sprain due to slipping and pulling heavy loads.\r\n\r\nThe _following symptoms_ may be noted: Lameness is not a common symptom of\r\nbog spavin. If there is inflammation present or the articulation is\r\ninjured, lameness occurs. The soft swelling that characterizes the bog\r\nspavin is most prominent toward the inside and front of the region. In the\r\nupper portion or hollow of the hock, and on the inside and outside, there\r\nmay be a second enlargement. Smaller enlargements may be present in other\r\nregions. All of the swellings feel soft, and pressure on any one of them\r\nmoves the fluid present in the others.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is directed at the removal of the lameness. Acute\r\ninflammation resulting from spavin may be relieved by cold applications and\r\nrest. Chronic lameness should be given the same treatment as recommended\r\nfor bone spavin. The enlargement can be successfully removed in growing\r\ncolts by the repeated application of mild blisters. It may be necessary to\r\ncontinue the treatment for several months. The removal of the enlargement\r\nin adult horses by an operation is recommended. The _greatest caution_ is\r\nrequired in performing this operation.\r\n\r\nCAPPED HOCK.--All swellings on the point of the hock are termed \"capped\r\nhock.\" The swellings may be due to an injury to the skin and the\r\nsubcutaneous tissue, or more important structures may be involved, as the\r\nsubcutaneous bursa, the tendon, or the synovial bursa or sack.\r\n\r\nCapped hock is _caused_ by the animal kicking in the stall or in harness,\r\nshipping in freight cars and lack of bedding in the stall. Unless the\r\ndeeper structures are bruised and inflamed the animal shows no lameness.\r\n\r\n_The character_ of the enlargement varies. When the injury is superficial,\r\nthe swelling feels firm, or pits on pressure. Later it may become more firm\r\nand feel like a loose, thickened, fibrous cap for the hock. Soft,\r\nfluctuating swellings are due to an inflammation of the bursa. Recent\r\ninjuries feel hot.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in hobbling the hind limbs of a horse\r\nthat kicks in the stable. This is usually necessary only at night. It may\r\nbe advisable to pad certain parts of the stall. Horses that are transported\r\nin cars should be protected against injuries during transit by the use of\r\nproper care and such arrangement of the animals in the car as may expose\r\nthem to the least injury. Recent injuries should be treated by the\r\napplication of cold and rest.\r\n\r\nAfter the inflammation has subsided tincture of iodine or blisters may be\r\napplied. The treatment of bursal enlargements is surgical. This consists in\r\nopening the bursa, destroying the lining membrane of the cavity and\r\ntreating the part daily until healed. The operation must be performed\r\ncarefully, as there is danger of infection with irritating organisms. The\r\nanimal should be given complete rest until the part is healed. Tincture of\r\niodine may be applied to the enlargement that may remain after healing has\r\noccurred. This should be continued daily until the skin becomes noticeably\r\nirritated. The treatment may be repeated, if necessary, after an interval\r\nof two weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Curbs.]\r\n\r\nCURB.--This term is applied to all swellings on the posterior border of the\r\nhock (Fig. 50). Thickenings or enlargements in this region may involve a\r\nvariety of structures. Thickening of the skin, tendons and sheath may\r\noccur. The large ligament that extends from the posterior border of the\r\nbone that forms the summit of the hock to the external splint bone, and\r\nacts as a stay for the point of the hock, is the structure usually involved\r\nin curb.\r\n\r\nFaulty conformation is a _predisposing cause_. A narrow base weakens the\r\nhock at this point, and the extreme length of the bone that forms its\r\nsummit gives the powerful muscles attached to it greater leverage than in a\r\nwell-conformed hock. This results in strain to the ligament at the\r\nposterior portion of the region.\r\n\r\n_The exciting causes_ are strains resulting from jumping, slipping,\r\nrearing, heavy pulling and bruising of the part.\r\n\r\n_In examining the hock_ for curb it is necessary to stand to the side and\r\nnote the profile of the posterior border. Excessive development of the head\r\nof the external splint bone should not be mistaken for curb. As viewed from\r\nthe side, the posterior border of the hock should appear straight.\r\n\r\nThe curb appears as a swelling on this straight line. It varies in size. A\r\nrecent curb is usually hot and firm, or may feel soft if enlargement is\r\nformed by fluid, hard if formed by bone. Lameness seldom occurs, but if\r\npresent, resembles spavin lameness.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in selecting for breeding, animals that\r\nhave strong, straight hocks, and using the necessary care in handling and\r\nworking horses. It is not uncommon for young horses at the time they are\r\nbroken to harness to develop a curb. This may be prevented to a large\r\ndegree by careful handling. At the beginning of the inflammation the\r\napplication of cold and hand rubbing is indicated. After the inflammation\r\nhas subsided tincture of iodine or blisters should be applied. Rest is a\r\nnecessary part of the treatment early in the inflammation. If the lameness\r\ndoes not respond to the above treatment, it should be treated the same as\r\nfor bone spavin.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

They\r\nare hard organs, implanted in the superior and inferior jaws in the form of\r\na long and narrow arch that is open posteriorly. The free portions of the\r\nteeth project into the mouth, and present sharp or roughened table surfaces\r\nfor the crushing and tearing of food. In solipeds and ruminants the arch is\r\ninterrupted on each side by the inter-dental space or bars (Fig. 51). The\r\nteeth that form the middle and anterior portion of the arch are termed\r\nincisors (Fig. 52). Posterior to the incisors are the canines or tusks, and\r\nforming the arms of the arch are the molar teeth. Animals have two sets of\r\nteeth, temporary and permanent. The following table gives the number of the\r\ndifferent kinds of temporary and permanent teeth.\r\n\r\n               Temporary Teeth            Permanent Teeth\r\n           Incisors Canines Molars    Incisors Canines Molars\r\n\r\nSolipeds       12             12         12       4      24\r\nOx              8             12          8       0      24\r\nSheep           8             12          8       0      24\r\nHog            12             12         12       4      24\r\n\r\nThe tusks or canine teeth are not always present in the female. Ruminants\r\ndo not have upper incisor teeth.  The temporary teeth are erupted either\r\nbefore or within a few days to a few months after birth. The eruption of\r\nthe permanent teeth and the replacement of the temporary teeth occur at\r\ndifferent periods up to the age of four and one-half years (Fig. 53). It is\r\nwell to keep the following table of dentition in mind when examining the\r\nmouths of animals for the purpose of determining their age.[1]\r\n\r\n                    Horses              Cattle                Hogs\r\nTeeth        Temporary Permanent  Temporary Permanent  Temporary Permanent\r\n\r\nIncisors:              yrs. mos.           yrs. mos.               mos.\r\n  Centrals   At birth   2    6    At birth  1    8     At birth,   12\r\n                                                        or 3-4\r\n                                                        weeks\r\n  First      4-6 wks.   3    6    At birth  2    9     8-12 wks.   18\r\n    laterals\r\n  Second                          5-12 days 3    6\r\n    laterals\r\n  Corners    6-9 mos.   4    6   12-18 days 4    6     At birth     9\r\nMolars:\r\n  First      At birth   2    6    At birth  2    6     7 weeks      5\r\n  Second     At birth   2    6    At birth  1    6     8-28 days   14\r\n  Third      At birth   3    6    At birth  3          8-28 days   13\r\n  Fourth              10-12                 1    6                 13\r\n  Fifth                 2                   2                       5\r\n  Sixth                4-5                  2    6                  9\r\n  Seventh                                                          18\r\nCanines or             4-5                                          9\r\n  tusks\r\n\r\nIN DETERMINING THE AGE of the different domestic animals by the development\r\nand appearance of the teeth, most of the attention is given to the lower\r\nincisor teeth. Up to the fifth year, the age of the horse or ox can be\r\neasily determined by the eruption and replacement of the incisors.\r\n\r\nAt _one year_ of age the colt has a fully developed set of temporary\r\nincisors. The ruminant's incisors at this age all show wear.\r\n\r\n_The two-year-old colt_ shows a well-worn set of incisor teeth, and the\r\nruminant at this age has replaced the nippers or centrals.\r\n\r\n_The third_, _fourth_ and _fifth years_ are indicated by the replacement of\r\nthe temporary nippers, dividers and corners in the horse, and the first and\r\nsecond dividers and corner teeth in ruminants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Longitudinal section of incisor tooth: cup;\r\ncement; enamel; ivory; and pulp cavity.]\r\n\r\nIn the horse the permanent nippers are full grown and in wear at _three\r\nyears_ of age; the permanent dividers are full grown and in wear at _four\r\nyears_ of age; and the permanent corners are full grown and in wear at\r\n_five years_ of age. The table surfaces of the incisor teeth of a\r\nfive-year-old horse show different degrees of wear. At this period in the\r\nanimal's age, the nippers have been in wear two years, the dividers one\r\nyear, and the corners are beginning to show wear. In ruminants, all of the\r\nchisel-shaped table surfaces of the incisors show considerable wear when\r\nthe animal is five years old.\r\n\r\nAfter the animal has a full set of permanent teeth, we judge the age by the\r\ndegree of wear or the appearance of the table surfaces of the incisors,\r\ntheir shape, the angle with which they meet and the general appearance of\r\nthe head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Cross-section of head of young horse showing\r\nreplacement of molar tooth.]\r\n\r\nThere are several different factors that may cause the wear on the teeth,\r\nand the appearance of their table surfaces to vary in the different\r\nindividuals. The two factors that are of the most importance are the\r\nquality of the teeth and the character of feed. Soft teeth wear more\r\nquickly than hard teeth, and the teeth of horses that feed over closely\r\ncropped and sandy pastures wear rapidly because of the dirt and grit\r\npresent on the short grass. This variation in the wear is of little\r\nimportance to the person who must judge the age of a horse that he expects\r\nto purchase by the condition of the teeth. In reality, a horse is just as\r\nold as the wear on the teeth and his general appearance indicate. In order\r\nto stand severe work the animal must be able to masticate the feed, and\r\nprepare it for digestion in the stomach and intestines. The degree of wear\r\non the molar teeth may be indicated by the wear on the incisors. The\r\ngeneral condition of the horse and his ability to stand hard work depend\r\nvery largely on the condition of the table surfaces of the molars.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to judge the age of horses that have deformed mouths\r\nor that are in the habit of crib-biting, because of the irregularity in the\r\nwear of the incisors.\r\n\r\nWhen examining the teeth for the purpose of determining the horse's age,\r\nthe shape of the incisors, the angle with which they meet and the\r\nappearance of their table surfaces should be observed. The teeth of young\r\nhorses show more or less yellowish cement. At about seven years of age the\r\nanterior faces of the teeth are usually white, later a yellowish color. The\r\nteeth of middle-aged horses may be long, and in aged animals, narrow and\r\nshort. The incisors meet at a more acute angle in old than young horses.\r\n\r\n_The free portion of the incisor_ tooth is flattened from before to behind.\r\nAt the level of the gums its two diameters are about the same, but the\r\nportion of the tooth imbedded in the jaw bone is flattened from side to\r\nside. As the tooth becomes worn off, the length of the free portion is\r\nmaintained by a pushing out of the tooth, and a corresponding shortening of\r\nthe portion that is fixed or imbedded in the jaw.\r\n\r\n_The table surface of the unworn incisor_ tooth is covered with enamel, and\r\nin the middle portion the enamel forms a deep cup. After the tooth has\r\nbecome worn the margin of the table portion is then limited by a ring of\r\nenamel. This is termed the encircling enamel ring. The central portion of\r\nthe table shows a second ring, the central enamel ring, that limits the cup\r\nmargin (Fig. 54).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Transverse section of incisor tooth: peripheral\r\ncement; peripheral enamel; ivory; central enamel; and central cement.]\r\n\r\n_As the table surface_ represents a cross section of the tooth, its\r\nappearance and shape will then depend on the portion of the tooth that it\r\nrepresents. From year to year, there is a gradual shortening in the lateral\r\ndiameter, and an apparent increase in the diameter from before to behind.\r\nThese changes in shape are from a long, narrow table surface to an oval,\r\nfrom oval to circular and from circular to triangular (Fig. 55). As the\r\noriginal free portion of the tooth wears off, the cup becomes shallow and\r\nsmaller until the remnant is represented by a mere dot of enamel that\r\nfinally disappears from the posterior portion of the table. After the cup\r\nhas moved from the central portion of the crown and occupies a more\r\nposterior position, the dental star, which represents a cross section of\r\nthe pulp cavity, puts in its appearance. It first takes the form of a brown\r\nor dark streak, and later a circular dark spot which gradually increases in\r\nsize with the wear on the tooth and the age of the animal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--Table surfaces of nippers at different ages: four\r\nyears; six years; nine years, and fifteen years of age.]\r\n\r\nThe following changes in the shape and appearance of the incisor teeth of\r\nthe average horse occur in the different years. Unless otherwise mentioned,\r\nthe statements made regarding the appearance and wear on the table surfaces\r\napply to the lower incisor teeth.\r\n\r\nSIX YEARS.--The table surfaces form the most accurate guide. The cups of\r\nthe nippers tend to an oval form. The corner teeth have been in wear one\r\nyear at this time. The cup is deep and the posterior margin may show little\r\nwear. It is not uncommon to meet with corners that possess irregularly\r\ndeveloped tables, and have cups with posterior margins that are thin and do\r\nnot come into wear until later. For this reason, it is not best to depend\r\non the appearance of the corner teeth alone.\r\n\r\nSEVEN YEARS.--The teeth are usually whiter than the previous year. The\r\nprofile of the upper corner teeth shows a notch in the posterior portion of\r\nthe table surface. This is due to the superior corners overhanging the\r\ninferior corner teeth posteriorly, resulting in this portion not wearing\r\naway. This notch is sometimes slightly in evidence the previous year. The\r\ncups in the corners are smaller and the worn surface larger than at six.\r\nThe nippers show oval table surfaces and the dividers are beginning to take\r\non this shape. The shifting of the cups toward the posterior portion of the\r\ntables of the nippers and dividers is noticeable.\r\n\r\nEIGHT YEARS.--As viewed from the side, the profile of the teeth shows a\r\nvery noticeable increase in the obliquity with which they meet. The\r\nposterior borders of the corners show considerable wear. The notch in the\r\nsuperior corners is still present, but as the teeth come more nearly in\r\napposition it may begin to disappear. All of the inferior tables are level.\r\nThe nippers and dividers are oval in shape, and the cups have become\r\ndecidedly narrow. The nippers show a well-defined dark streak just in front\r\nof the cups. This is the beginning of the dental star.\r\n\r\nNINE YEARS.--The appearance of the table surface is more characteristic at\r\nthis time than the previous year. The cups are less prominent and the\r\nplainness or smoothness of the inferior table is more noticeable. The\r\nnippers are round, the cups triangular and the dark streak narrower and\r\nmore distinct than the previous year. The dividers are becoming round and\r\nthe corner teeth are oval.\r\n\r\nTEN YEARS.--The teeth are more oblique than in the eight-year-old and\r\nnine-year-old mouth. The table surfaces of the inferior nippers are\r\ndecidedly rounded, the cups are small, triangular and situated well toward\r\nthe posterior borders. The dark brown streak or dental star is situated in\r\nthe central portion of the nippers and dividers. The tables of the dividers\r\nare round.\r\n\r\nELEVEN YEARS.--The tables of the corner teeth are rounded. The dark streak\r\nor dental star is present in all of the teeth, and the remnants of the cups\r\nappear as small rings or spots of enamel near to the posterior borders of\r\nthe tables. The notch in the superior corners may reappear at this time.\r\n\r\nTWELVE YEARS.--The profile of the teeth when viewed from the side is quite\r\noblique. The table surfaces of all the incisors are round. But a trace of\r\nthe cup remains in the inferior incisors. The head of the animal is\r\nbeginning to show age. The inferior border of the jaw bone appears\r\nnarrower, or sharper than in the young horse.\r\n\r\nTHIRTEEN YEARS.--All of the specks of enamel or the remnants of the cups\r\nare gone from the lower incisors. A larger notch may be present in the\r\nupper corner teeth than at twelve. The tables of the inferior nippers are\r\nbecoming triangular and show a small, dark spot or dental star.\r\n\r\nFOURTEEN YEARS.--The tables of the inferior nippers are triangular, and the\r\ndental star appears as a dark round spot in both the nippers and dividers.\r\n\r\nFIFTEEN YEARS.--The angle with which the teeth meet is greater than at\r\ntwelve, the teeth are smaller and dental stars are represented by dark\r\nround spots in all of the inferior incisors. The tables of the nippers and\r\ndividers are triangular.\r\n\r\nSEVENTEEN YEARS.--All of the tables of the lower incisor teeth are\r\ntriangular. The teeth are narrower and smaller than at fifteen. The profile\r\nof the incisors, viewed from the side, is quite angular. The dental stars\r\nare prominent.\r\n\r\nNINETEEN YEARS.--All of the signs of the seventeen-year-old mouth are more\r\nprominent. The cups have usually disappeared from the upper incisors.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This table is from dentition tables given in \"Age of the\r\nDomestic Animals,\" by Huidekoper.]\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

These different deformities result in\r\nunequal wear on the table surfaces of the incisors and molars. In both the\r\novershot and undershot jaws, the incisor teeth become abnormally long. In\r\nthe _parrot-mouth_, the wear occurs on the posterior face of the superior\r\nand the anterior face of the inferior incisors, the teeth becoming worn to\r\nrather a sharp edge, depending on the degree of the deformity. In the\r\n_lantern-jaw_, the wear occurs on the posterior face of the lower and the\r\nanterior face of the superior row of incisors, the teeth taking on somewhat\r\nthe same shape as the parrot-mouth. The greater the deformity and the older\r\nthe horse becomes, the more difficult it is for the animal to feed or\r\ngraze on pasture.\r\n\r\nIn all horses, the two rows of molar teeth are wider apart in the superior\r\nthan in the inferior jaw. This results in the external border of the tables\r\nof the superior row of molars becoming longer, or projecting further\r\ndownward than the internal border. The wear on the table surfaces of the\r\ninferior row of molars is just the opposite of the superior row. In the\r\n_scissor-mouth_ the wear takes place largely on the internal face of the\r\nsuperior and the external face of the inferior row of molars. The teeth\r\nbecome worn to more or less of a blunt cutting edge, and after a time the\r\nmolars come together somewhat like the jaws of a pair of scissors. A horse\r\nwith a badly deformed scissor-mouth is unable to grind the feed, and unless\r\ngiven special care, suffers severely from innutrition.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ of deformed mouths consists in removing the irregular or\r\nunworn portion of the teeth by means of the tooth float and cutters. This\r\nattention should be given early before the free portion of the tooth has\r\nbecome excessively long and irregular. This should be followed by dressing\r\nthe teeth every six or twelve months.\r\n\r\nSHARP LATERAL BORDERS ON THE MOLAR TEETH.--This is a very common condition\r\nin horses. The external border of the superior and the internal border of\r\nthe inferior row of molars wear away slowly, and sometimes become quite\r\nsharp. This is objectionable because the sharp points lacerate the mucous\r\nmembrane of the cheek and tongue, and the mastication of the feed is\r\nseriously interfered with.\r\n\r\nThis condition is _caused_ by an excessive difference in the width of the\r\njaws, unusually prominent ridges of enamel on the external face of the\r\nsuperior molars, and any conditions that may limit the movements of the\r\njaw.\r\n\r\nThe following _symptoms_ may be noted. The animal has difficulty in\r\nmasticating the feed because of injury to the cheeks or tongue by the sharp\r\npoints of enamel. This condition may be indicated by holding the head to\r\none side. Salivation is usually present. Acute indigestion and innutrition\r\nmay occur.\r\n\r\nBy examining the teeth, their condition can be determined. The sharp\r\nborders may be removed by dressing or floating the teeth. It is advisable\r\nin the majority of horses to float the teeth at least once in every twelve\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIRREGULARITIES IN THE TABLE SURFACE OF THE MOLAR TEETH.--Horses eight years\r\nof age or older frequently have irregular molars (Fig. 56). This is due\r\nvery largely to the difference in the quality of the teeth. The harder\r\nmolars do not wear off as rapidly as the softer ones. This results in the\r\ntable surfaces of the rows of molars becoming wavy or step-like in outline.\r\nSometimes the first or sixth molar overhangs or projects beyond the\r\ncorresponding tooth of the opposite jaw. When this occurs, the over-hanging\r\nportion may become long and sharp. A molar tooth becomes excessively long\r\nif the opposite one is decayed or removed.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are very much the same as when the borders of the molars\r\nare sharp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--Teeth showing uneven wear occurring in\r\nold horses.]\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in levelling the tables as frequently as necessary\r\nby cutting off the longer projections, and removing the sharp edges with a\r\ntooth float.\r\n\r\nSMOOTH MOUTH.--In old age the tables of the molar teeth may become so\r\nsmooth that the horse cannot grind or masticate the feed. When all of the\r\nmolars are in this condition, a rubbing sound may be noted when the animal\r\nis masticating hay. After attempting to chew the hay, it may be dropped\r\nfrom the mouth. Innutrition always occurs.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in feeding chops and soft feeds.\r\n\r\nDENTAL DISEASES.--Inflammation of the alveolar periosteum is a common\r\ndental disease in domestic animals. This is an inflammation of the alveolar\r\ndental membrane that fixes the tooth in the tooth cavity.\r\n\r\nInjuries to the gums and cracks or fissures in the tooth are the _common\r\ncauses_. Caries or tooth decay is not uncommon. The predisposing factor is\r\na poor quality of enamel and dentine. The process of decay is assisted by\r\nmicroorganisms.\r\n\r\nThe _early symptoms_ may escape notice. Slobbering, masticating on one\r\nside, holding the head to one side, retained masses of food in the mouth\r\nand a disagreeable odor frequently occur. Caries may be indicated at first\r\nby a dark spot on the table of the tooth, later by a cavity. In horses,\r\ninflammation of the alveolar membrane results in a bony enlargement on the\r\nside of the face if the superior molar is involved. A swelling of the jaw\r\nand fistula may result if a lower molar is involved (Fig. 57).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Fistula of jaw. This condition was the result of\r\nneglected treatment of decayed teeth.]\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in the prompt removal of the tooth. This is more\r\ndifficult in young animals than it is in the middle-aged or old. Unless the\r\ntooth is already loosened it may be necessary to remove it by trephining.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

Heat, redness, swelling, pain\r\nand disturbed function are the symptoms which characterize inflammation.\r\n\r\n_The changes in the circulation_ occurring in inflammation are as follows:\r\n(1) An increase in the rate of the blood-flow through the blood-vessels of\r\nthe part and their dilation; (2) diminished velocity followed by the\r\nblood-flow becoming entirely suspended; (3) following the retardation or\r\nsuspension of the blood stream, white blood-corpuscles accumulate along the\r\nwalls of the small veins and capillaries; (4) white and red\r\nblood-corpuscles migrate from the vessels into the neighboring tissue, and\r\nblood-serum transudes through the walls of the vessels, forming the\r\ninflammatory swellings. The red blood-cells do not escape from the\r\nblood-vessels in any numbers unless the walls of the blood-vessels become\r\ninjured or badly diseased.\r\n\r\n_The causes of inflammation_ may be grouped under the following heads:\r\nmechanical, chemical, thermic and infectious. The _mechanical_ or\r\n_traumatic causes_ commonly produce inflammation in domestic animals. These\r\nare kicks, strains of tendons, ligaments or muscles and wounds.\r\nInflammation originating from injuries very frequently changes to an\r\ninfectious form, through the infection of the part by bacteria. Bruised\r\ntissue may become infected with pus-producing organisms, and an abscess or\r\nlocal swelling form. All accidental wounds in domestic animals become more\r\nor less infected by irritating microorganisms.\r\n\r\nThe following _symptoms_ occur in local inflammation. Increased heat in the\r\npart is an important symptom. It is due to the increased blood-flow to the\r\npart. Because of the pigmented, hairy skin of domestic animals, redness is\r\nof little value in locating superficial inflammation. Swelling is a\r\nvaluable local symptom. It is produced by the inflammatory exudates. Pain\r\nresults from the pressure on the sensory nerves by the inflammatory\r\nswelling. For example, the laminae of the foot are imprisoned between the\r\nhorny wall and the pedal bone. This structure is well supplied with sensory\r\nnerves, and when it becomes inflamed and swollen, the tissues are subject\r\nto severe pressure and the pain is severe. Inflammation of a tendon results\r\nin lameness; of the udder, in suspension of milk secretions; and of the\r\nstomach by interference with digestion of the feed. Such symptoms may be\r\ngrouped under the head of disturbed functions.\r\n\r\n_The character of an inflammation_ is largely modified by the nature of the\r\ntissue in which it occurs. A serous inflammation is characterized by\r\nserous, watery exudates. This form occurs in the serous membranes, mucous\r\nmembranes and skin. Blisters on the skin and inflammation of bursae (capped\r\nhock and shoe boil) are examples of this type. Sero-fibrinous\r\ninflammations, such as occur in pleurisy and peritonitis, are common.\r\nChronic inflammation commonly results in new formations of tissue, and it\r\nis named according to the character of the new tissue formed, as ossifying,\r\nadhesive, and fibrous inflammation. Pus-forming bacteria produce\r\nsuppurative inflammation. Such diseases as tuberculosis, glanders and\r\nhog-cholera are specific inflammations. Specific infectious diseases may be\r\nclassed as generalized inflammation, as they usually involve the entire\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nInflammation terminates in resolution when the serum is reabsorbed by the\r\nblood-vessels and lymphatics, the living blood-cells find their way back\r\ninto the circulation and the dead cells disintegrate and are taken up by\r\nthe vessels. The time required for the tissues to return to the normal\r\nvaries from a few hours to several weeks. An acute inflammation may end in\r\nthe chronic form. This may then terminate in new formations, such as\r\nadhesions, fibrous thickenings and bony enlargements. Severe inflammation,\r\nespecially if localized and superficial, may result in death of the part or\r\ngangrene.\r\n\r\nThe following _treatment_ is recommended: The cause of the irritation to\r\nthe tissue must be removed. It is very essential that the part be rested.\r\nThe necessary rest may be obtained in different ways. Inflamed tendons,\r\nligaments, and muscles may be rested by placing the animal in a sling,\r\nstanding it in a stall, or fixing the part with bandages. Rest of the\r\nstomach or intestinal tract may be obtained by feeding a light diet, or\r\nwithholding all feed. Comfortable quarters, special care and dieting the\r\nanimal are important factors in the treatment of inflammation.\r\n\r\nThe agents used in the treatment of superficial and localized inflammation\r\nare _heat, cold, massage_ and _counterirritation_. _Heat_ is indicated in\r\nall inflammations, excepting when of bacterial origin. It stimulates the\r\ncirculation and reabsorption of the inflammatory exudates, and by relaxing\r\nthe tissues helps greatly in relieving pain. _Cold_ is more effective in\r\nthe highly acute and septic (suppurative) inflammation. Its action consists\r\nprincipally in the contraction of the dilated blood-vessels. Continuous\r\nirrigation of the part with cold water is the most satisfactory method of\r\napplying cold. _Massage_ is a very important method of treating superficial\r\ninflammation. Mild, stimulating liniments are usually used in connection\r\nwith hand-rubbing or friction. Chronic inflammation is usually treated with\r\n_counterirritants._ Blistering and firing are the most important methods\r\nof treatment. Such counterirritation makes possible the absorption of the\r\ninflammatory exudates by changing the chronic inflammation to the acute\r\nform.\r\n\r\nWOUNDS.--A wound, in the restricted sense that the term is commonly used,\r\nincludes only such injuries that are accompanied by breaks or divisions of\r\nthe skin and mucous membrane. It is usually an open, hemorrhagic injury.\r\n\r\nIf the tissues are severed by a sharp instrument and the edges of the wound\r\nare smooth, it is classed as an _incised_ or _clean-cut wound_. This class\r\nis not commonly met with in domestic animals outside of operative wounds.\r\n\r\nWhen the tissues are torn irregularly, the injury is classed as a\r\n_lacerated wound_. A barb-wire cut is the best example of this class.\r\n\r\nA _contused wound_ is an injury caused by a blunt object. Such injuries may\r\nbe divided into superficial and deep. Superficial-contused wounds may be an\r\nabrasion to the skin or mucous surface. Deep-contused wounds may be\r\nfollowed by loss of tissue or sloughing, and may present irregular, swollen\r\nmargins. Such injuries are commonly caused by kicks.\r\n\r\n_Punctured wounds_ are many times deeper than the width of the opening or\r\nbreak in the skin or mucous membrane. This class is produced by sharp\r\nobjects, such as nails, splinters of wood, and forks.\r\n\r\nSometimes, wounds are given special names, as gun-shot, poisoned, and open\r\njoint, depending on the nature of the cause and region involved.\r\n\r\nBleeding or hemorrhage is the most constant symptom. The degree of\r\nhemorrhage depends on the kind, number and size of the blood-vessels\r\nsevered. In arterial hemorrhage, the blood is bright red and spurts from\r\nthe mouth of the cut vessel. In venous hemorrhage, the blood is darker and\r\nflows in a continuous stream. In abrasions and superficial wounds capillary\r\nhemorrhage occurs. Death may follow severe hemorrhage. Weak pulse,\r\ngeneral weakness, vertigo, loss of consciousness and death may result if\r\none-third of the total quantity of blood is lost. Unthriftiness and general\r\ndebility may follow the loss of a less quantity of blood.\r\n\r\nThe following _symptoms_ may be noted in the different kinds of wounds: The\r\nsensitiveness to the pain resulting from accidental or operative wounds\r\nvaries in the different individuals and species, and in the kind of tissue\r\ninjured. Injuries to the foot, periosteum, skin and mucous membrane are\r\nmore painful than are injuries to cartilages and tendons. The appearance of\r\nthe wound varies in the different regions and the different tissues.\r\n\r\nIf the tissues are badly torn or bruised, swelling and sloughing may occur.\r\nIf the wound is transverse to the muscular fibres, it gaps more than when\r\nparallel to the muscle. When infected by irritating organisms, open and\r\npunctured wounds (Fig. 58) become badly swollen, discharge pus freely and\r\nheal slowly with excessive granulations. Wounds involving tendons, bursae\r\nand closed articulations become swollen and discharge synovia. Wounds\r\ninvolving muscles, tendons and bursae usually cause lameness, and when\r\ninvolving a special organ, interfere with, or destroy, its function.\r\nExtensive or serious wounds may be followed by loss of appetite. An\r\nabnormal body temperature and other symptoms characteristic of the\r\ndifferent forms of blood poisoning may follow infection of the injured\r\ntissues by certain germs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--A large hock caused by a punctured wound of the\r\njoint.]\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which wounds heal depends upon the kind of tissue injured\r\nand the amount to be replaced, the degree of motion in the part, the kind\r\nand degree of infection and irritation and the general condition of the\r\nanimal. In general, skin and muscles heal rapidly, tendons slowly,\r\ncartilages unsatisfactorily and nerve tissue very slowly. Healing is\r\ngreatly interfered with by movement of the part (Fig. 59). The more nearly\r\nthe part can be fixed or rested, the more quickly and satisfactorily does\r\nhealing occur. Irritation by biting, nibbling, licking, bandaging, wrong\r\nmethods of treatment and filth retard healing and may result in serious\r\nwound complications. An animal in poor physical condition, or one kept\r\nunder unfavorable conditions for healing, cannot recover from the injury\r\nrapidly or satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--A large inflammatory growth following an injury to\r\nthe front of the hock.]\r\n\r\nWOUND HEALING.--The following forms of healing commonly occur in wounds:\r\nFirst and second intention; under a scab, and by abnormal granulation.\r\n\r\n_Healing by first intention_ occurs when the wound is clean cut and there\r\nis very little destruction of tissue, and when there is no suppuration or\r\npus formation. The blood and wound secretions cause the edges of the wound\r\nto adhere. After a few days or a week the union becomes firm. Very little\r\nscar tissue is necessary in this form of healing.\r\n\r\n_Healing by second intention_ is characterized by pus formation and\r\ngranulation tissue. After the first day, the surface of the wound may be\r\nmore or less covered by red, granular-like tissue. Later this granular\r\nappearance is modified by an accumulation of creamy pus and swelling of the\r\npart, and finally scab formation and contraction of the new scar tissue.\r\n\r\nAbrasions and superficial wounds usually _heal under a scab_. The scab is\r\nformed by the blood and wound secretions. This protects the surface of the\r\nwound until finally the destroyed tissue is replaced by the granulations,\r\nand the skin surface is restored.\r\n\r\n_Abnormal granulation_ is not an uncommon form of healing in domestic\r\nanimals. Mechanical and bacterial irritation causes the injured tissue to\r\nbecome swollen and inflamed. In such a wound, excessive and rapid\r\ngranulation occurs, the new tissue piling up over the cut surfaces and\r\nappearing red and uneven. This is termed excessive granulation or \"proud\r\nflesh.\" This tissue may refuse to \"heal over,\" or the scar may be large,\r\nprominent and painful. Abnormal tissue (horny or tumor-like) may sometimes\r\nform.\r\n\r\nWOUND TREATMENT.--Wounds in domestic animals are frequently allowed to heal\r\nwithout special care or treatment. This is unfortunate. The careful and\r\nintelligent treatment of wounds would greatly decrease the loss resulting\r\nfrom this class of injuries. The method of treatment varies in the\r\ndifferent kinds of wounds.\r\n\r\n_The first step_ in the treatment is to _check the haemorrhage_. Heat,\r\nligation, pressure and torsion are the different methods recommended.\r\nBathing the wound with hot water (115\\260-120\\260 F.) is a satisfactory\r\nmethod of controlling haemorrhage from small blood-vessels. Ligation and\r\ntorsion of the cut end of large blood-vessels should be practised.\r\nPressure over the surface of the wound is the most convenient method of\r\nControlling haemorrhage in most cases. Whenever possible, the part should\r\nbe bandaged heavily with clean cheese cloth or muslin. Before applying\r\nthe bandage, it is advisable to cover the wound with a piece of sterile\r\nabsorbent cotton that is well dusted with boric acid. Hemorrhage from\r\nwounds that cannot be bandaged may be temporarily stopped by pressure\r\nwith the hand, or, better, by packing the wound with absorbent cotton\r\nand holding this in place with sutures. This should be left in place for\r\na period of twelve or thirty-six hours, depending on the extent of the\r\nhaemorrhage and character of the wound.\r\n\r\nThe next step is the _preparation of the wound for healing._ The injured\r\ntissues should be carefully examined for foreign bodies such as hair, dirt,\r\ngravel, slivers of wood and nails. The hair along the margins of the wound\r\nshould be trimmed, and all tissue that is so torn and detached as to\r\ninterfere with healing cut away. Drainage for the wound secretions and pus\r\nshould be provided. The advisability of suturing the wound depends on its\r\ncharacter and location. A contused-lacerated wound should not be closed\r\nwith sutures unless it is clean and shows no evidence of sloughing. A badly\r\ninfected wound should be left open unless satisfactory drainage for the pus\r\nand wound secretions can be provided. Wounds across the muscle and in parts\r\nthat are quite movable should not be sutured.\r\n\r\n_The after-treatment_ consists in keeping the animal quiet, if the wound is\r\nin a part that is quite movable, and preventing it from biting, licking or\r\nnibbling the injury. Wounds in the region of the foot become irritated with\r\ndirt and by rubbing against weeds and grass. This makes it advisable to\r\nkeep the animal in a clean stall until healing is well advanced. Local\r\ntreatment consists in keeping the wound clean by washing the part daily, or\r\ntwice daily, with a one per cent water solution of a cresol disinfectant.\r\nLiquor cresolis compositus may be used. It is sometimes advisable to\r\nprotect the granulating surface against irritation by dusting it over with\r\na non-irritating antiseptic powder, or applying a mixture of carbolic acid\r\none part and glycerine twelve parts. After the wound shows healthy\r\ngranulations longer intervals should lapse between treatments.\r\n\r\nIn poorly cared for, and badly infected wounds, the part may become badly\r\nswollen, the granulations pile up and the wound refuse to \"heal over.\" It\r\nmay be advisable in such cases to cut away the excessive granulations and\r\nstop the haemorrhage by cauterization with a red-hot iron, or by\r\ncompression. Unhealthy granulations may be kept down by applying caustic\r\noccasionally.\r\n\r\nABSCESS.--This is an accumulation of pus in the tissues. It may be due to a\r\nsevere bruise or contusion that is followed by the infection of the part\r\nwith some of the pus-producing bacteria. Abscesses occur in certain\r\ninfectious diseases. In strangles, the disease-producing organism may be\r\ncarried to different regions of the body by the circulatory vessels. This\r\nmay result in a number of abscesses forming in the different body tissues.\r\n\r\nThe following _forms of abscess_ are recognized: hot and cold, superficial\r\nand deep, simple and multiple. The hot is the acute, and the cold the\r\nchronic abscess. The terms superficial and deep allude to the relative\r\nposition of the abscess, and simple and multiple to the number present.\r\n\r\nAn abscess may first appear as a hot, painful swelling. If superficial, the\r\nskin feels tense and the contents fluctuate when pressed on. Later the\r\nfever subsides and no pain may occur when the abscess is pressed upon. Deep\r\nabscess may not fluctuate.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in converting the abscess into an open wound\r\nwhenever possible. The incision should extend to the lowest part of the\r\nwall, so as to insure complete drainage. A cold abscess in the shoulder\r\nregion may become lined by a layer of tissue that retards healing. In order\r\nto hasten the healing process, it may be necessary to remove this. Until\r\ngranulation is well advanced, the abscess cavity should be irrigated daily\r\nwith a one per cent water solution of liquor cresolis compositus, or a one\r\nto two thousand water solution of corrosive sublimate. The surface of the\r\nskin in the region of the abscess should be kept clean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Fistula of the withers, showing the effect of\r\nusing caustics carelessly.]\r\n\r\nFISTULOUS WITHERS AND POLL EVIL.--These terms are applied to swellings,\r\nblood tumors, abscesses and pus fistulae that may be present in the region\r\nof the poll and withers (Fig. 60). Pus fistula is the characteristic lesion\r\npresent, and it is the result of a suppurative inflammation of the tissues\r\nin the region. The abscess cavity or cavities are usually deep, and may\r\ninvolve the ligaments and vertebrae.\r\n\r\nBruises or contusions are the most _common causes_. The prominence of these\r\nregions predisposes them to injury in the stable, or when rolling on rough\r\nor stony ground. Bites and bruises to the withers resulting from other\r\nhorses taking hold of the region with the teeth, or striking the part\r\nagainst a hard surface, are frequent causes.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both preventive and surgical. All possible causes should\r\nbe investigated. This is of special importance on premises where several\r\nhorses develop fistulous withers and poll evil. If the cause then becomes\r\nknown, it should be removed.\r\n\r\n_The surgical treatment_ consists in opening up the different abscess\r\ncavities, providing complete drainage for the pus and destroying the tissue\r\nthat lines the walls of the cavities. Horses that are prone to rub the\r\nregion should be prevented from doing this, as such irritation retards\r\nhealing. Autogenous bacterins should be used in addition to the surgical\r\ntreatment. A pus fistula should heal from the bottom, and if the opening\r\nbecomes closed, drainage should be re-established. The daily treatment is\r\nthe same as recommended for abscesses. Excessive cutting and destruction of\r\nthe tissues with caustic preparations result in scarring and deformity of\r\nthe part. Such radical lines of treatment should be discouraged. We should\r\nnot delay the surgical treatment of abscesses in the regions of the poll\r\nand withers.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Name and describe the different forms of inflammation.\r\n\r\n2.

In the dog the largest percentage of fractures occurs in\r\nthe superior regions of the limbs.\r\n\r\nFractures may be classified as _simple_ and _compound, complete_ and\r\n_incomplete, comminuted_ or _splinter_. In the simple fracture the skin\r\nover the region escapes injury, but in the compound fracture the skin is\r\nbroken and the ends of the broken bone may protrude through it. The terms\r\ncomplete and incomplete are used in describing fractures in which the ends\r\nof the bones are not attached to each other, or partially so. In the\r\ncomminuted fracture the bone is broken into a number of pieces. There are a\r\nnumber of other terms that may be used in designating the different kinds\r\nof fractures, such as double, when both bones in the region are broken, and\r\noblique, transverse and longitudinal, depending on the direction of the\r\nbreak.\r\n\r\n_The causes_ of fractures may be divided into external or mechanical, and\r\ninternal. Fractures may result from kicks, blows, muscular strain and\r\ncontusions. Abnormal fragility due to disease, extreme youth and old age\r\nare the internal predisposing factors.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are crepitation, abnormal movement and deformity of the\r\npart. Abnormal movement of the part and inability to support weight occur\r\nin fractures of the bones of the limbs. Crepitation or a grinding, rubbing\r\nsound due to the movement of the ends of the broken bones on one another\r\noccurs when the part is moved or manipulated with the hands. Pain, swelling\r\nand injury to the skin are other local symptoms. The new tissue or bone\r\ncallus is formed by the bone-forming cells in the deeper layer of the\r\nperiosteum and bone-marrow.\r\n\r\n_The prognosis is unfavorable._ The larger percentage of fractures in\r\ndomestic animals are incurable, or make an unsatisfactory recovery. This is\r\ndue to careless treatment, the character of the fracture and the inability\r\nto fix the ends of the broken bone. Fractures in young and small animals\r\nusually heal quickly. Individuals that are healthy and vigorous usually\r\nmake a speedy recovery. Fractures heal very slowly in the aged. Compound\r\nand comminuted fractures are impossible to treat in the larger percentage\r\nof cases.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in fixing the broken bone or bones in a normal\r\nposition by means of bandages and splints. If this is not practised, the\r\nsurrounding tissues become injured by the broken ends of the bone, and the\r\nfracture may become so complicated as to render treatment useless. Motion\r\nretards or prevents the repair of the break.\r\n\r\nHowever, fractures of the ribs, pelvic bones and sometimes long bones that\r\nare well covered by heavy muscles heal naturally or in the absence of any\r\nmeans of retention.\r\n\r\n_Bandaging_.--The attendant must use good judgment in devising means of\r\nfixing the broken bone, and in holding it in its natural position. Whenever\r\npossible, a plaster bandage should be used. This must not be made too\r\nheavy, and it is very necessary to adjust it properly, so that it will stay\r\nin place and not become too tight or too loose. When applied to the limb,\r\nthe bandage should extend as far down as the hoof, and some distance above\r\nthe break. This is necessary in order to keep it from slipping down and\r\nbecoming too loose. A soft bandage should be applied first in order to\r\nequalize the pressure from the plaster cast and protect the skin. Wooden\r\nsplints are not very satisfactory agents for the treatment of fractures.\r\nThick leather that has been made soft by soaking in warm water and then\r\nshaping it to the part makes a more satisfactory splint. In all cases a\r\nsoft bandage should be applied under the splint. The adjustment of the\r\nplaster bandage or splint should be noticed daily, and whenever necessary\r\nit should be removed and readjusted. Injuries to the skin must be carefully\r\ncleaned, disinfected and bandaged before applying the plaster bandage. If\r\nevidence of wound infection occurs later, the bandage must be removed and\r\nthe wound treated. Large animals suffering with a fracture of any of the\r\nbones of the limb should be placed in slings. Incomplete fracture should\r\nreceive the same treatment as simple fracture. If this is practised, the\r\ndanger of its becoming complete is avoided.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--Shoulder abscess caused by loose-fitting harness.]\r\n\r\nHARNESS INJURIES.--This class of injuries is common in horses that are\r\ngiven steady, hard work, or that are not accustomed to work. Young horses,\r\nwhen first put to hard work, are especially prone to injuries from the\r\ncollar. A large proportion of these injuries are due to an ill-fitting\r\nharness or saddle.\r\n\r\nWhen the harness is not adjusted or fitted properly, there is severe\r\npressure on certain parts. This is the common cause of shoulder abscesses\r\n(Fig. 61), sore necks and sit-fasts. Rough, uneven surfaces on the faces of\r\nthe collar and saddle are the common causes of galling. The character of\r\nthe work is an important factor. Work that requires the animal to support\r\nweight on the top surface of the neck is productive of sore neck. Heavy\r\nwork over rough, uneven ground frequently causes shoulder abscesses and\r\nstrained muscles.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and most common harness injuries are galling, sore shoulders\r\nand sore neck. Harness galls first appear as flat, painful swellings. On\r\nraising the collar from the skin the inflamed area appears dry and the\r\nsurrounding hair is wet with sweat. Later, the skin becomes hard and its\r\nouter layer, and sometimes the deeper layer as well, slough, or is rubbed\r\noff by friction of the harness. The surface then appears red and moist.\r\nFluctuating swellings due to small collections of blood and lymph sometimes\r\nform. Sometimes, small areas on the face of the shoulder and that portion\r\nof the back pressed on by the saddle become swollen, indurated and hard and\r\ngive the shoulder a rough appearance. Continuous irritation from the collar\r\nmay cause an inflammatory thickening of the subcutaneous tissue in the\r\nshoulder region, and the skin appears loose and somewhat folded. This\r\nuneven surface is productive of chronic collar galls.\r\n\r\n_A sit-fast_ is characterized by a large swelling at the top of the neck,\r\nfollowed by a deep sloughing of the tissues. A slightly swollen, wrinkled\r\ncondition of the skin over the top of the neck is sometimes present in\r\nhorses that resist the attendant, when he attempts to handle the part or\r\nharness the animal. This form of sore neck is evidently very painful,\r\nalthough little evidence of inflammation is present.\r\n\r\nStrain of shoulder muscles and shoulder abscesses have been discussed under\r\ntheir separate heads.\r\n\r\n_The treatment is very largely preventive_. Too little attention is given\r\nto the proper fitting of the harness and saddle. A well-fitted collar that\r\nproperly distributes the weight on the shoulder, and is neither too small\r\nor too large at the top of the neck, is the best preventive for shoulder\r\nand neck injuries. Old, ill-fitting, lumpy collars should not be used.\r\nNeither should the same collar be used for different horses. Farmers should\r\navoid using sweat pads that are lumpy or soaked with sweat. If soft and\r\ndry, such pads are useful in preventing galling. The surfaces of the collar\r\nor saddle that come in contact with the skin should be kept smooth and\r\nclean. In the spring of the year, it is advisable to bathe the shoulders of\r\nwork horses with cold water twice a day. Bathing the shoulders with the\r\nfollowing preparation is a useful preventive measure: lead acetate four\r\nounces, zinc sulfate three ounces and water one gallon. Smooth leather pads\r\nfor the top of the collar and saddle are useful preventive and curative\r\nagents.\r\n\r\n_Galls are lest treated by rest_. Ointments or \"gall cures\" are usually\r\napplied. The following dry dressing dusted over the red, moist, abraded\r\nsurfaces is quite healing: tannic acid one ounce, boric acid four ounces,\r\nand calomel two ounces. This may be dusted over the part two or three times\r\ndaily. Dry, abraded surfaces may be treated by applying a mixture of\r\nglycerine four ounces, tannic acid one-half ounce and carbolic acid one\r\ndram. In operating for the removal of fibrous enlargements, thickened skin\r\nand abscesses on the front of the shoulder, it is advisable to make the\r\nincision in the skin well to the side of the face of the shoulder in order\r\nto avoid scarring the surface that comes in contact with the collar.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

This operation is of greatest economic importance in dairy and\r\nfeeding cattle. When first practised, the dehorning of mature cattle was\r\ncondemned by some persons who deemed it an inhuman and unnecessary\r\noperation. It is surely a humane act to remove the horns of cattle that are\r\nconfined in small yards and pastures, and prevent them from painfully, or\r\nseriously, injuring one another.\r\n\r\nIn most localities there are men who are well equipped to dehorn cattle,\r\nand able to perform this operation for a very moderate fee. It is not\r\nadvisable to attempt to dehorn a number of adult cattle if the operator is\r\nnot well equipped for the work. Unless a well-constructed dehorning rack is\r\navailable for confining the animals, there is danger of injuring them and\r\nit is very difficult to saw off the horn quickly and satisfactorily. This\r\nincreases the pain that the animal suffers, and horn stubs soon develop.\r\n\r\nGood equipment, such as a chute, saw or clippers, is necessary. A dehorning\r\nchute should be built of plank with a good frame well bolted together, with\r\nstanchion and nose block for confining the head. Most operators prefer a\r\nmeat saw for cutting off the horns. It is preferable to dehorning shears,\r\nas there is danger of fracturing the frontal bone when removing the horns\r\nof mature cattle. The best form of dehorning shears have a wide V in the\r\ncutting edge.\r\n\r\n_The operation is very simple_. The horn should be cut off at a point from\r\none-quarter to one-half an inch below the hair line or skin. If this is not\r\npractised, an irregular horn growth or stub of horn develops. It is usually\r\nunnecessary to apply anything to the wound. If the animal does not strike\r\nor rub the part, the clot that forms closes the blood-vessels and the\r\nhaemorrhage stops. In case of haemorrhage of a serious nature, a small\r\npiece of absorbent cotton may be spread over the surface of the wound, and\r\npushed in to the opening in order to keep it in place. Pine tar may be\r\nsmeared over this dressing. Some operators prefer cauterizing the wound\r\nwith a red-hot iron for the purpose of preventing haemorrhage. During warm\r\nweather, the wound should be washed daily with a two per cent water\r\nsolution of a coal tar disinfectant, until healing is well advanced. A very\r\nnecessary after-treatment is the washing of the part after two or three\r\ndays for the purpose of removing the dried blood.\r\n\r\nThe opening at the base of the horn communicates directly with the frontal\r\nsinus, a large cavity situated between the two plates of the frontal bone.\r\nSometimes the bone is slivered, or the wound becomes infected and inflamed.\r\nThis may be due to a dirty dehorning saw, or getting dirt into the wound.\r\nThe inflammation may extend to the sinus and a heavy discharge from the\r\ncavity occur. This complication may be prevented by placing the saw or\r\ncutters in a disinfectant when not in use, and cleaning and disinfecting\r\nthe wound very carefully for a few days after the operation.\r\n\r\n_The horn buttons of calves_ from a few days to one week of age can be\r\ndestroyed, and the growth of the horn prevented by applying caustic soda or\r\npotash to them. The method of procedure is as follows: Clip away the hair\r\nfrom around the base of the horn tissue and apply a little vaseline to the\r\nskin near, but not close to, the base of the horn; moisten the horn button\r\nand rub it two or three times with the end of the stick of caustic; do not\r\nallow the calf to go out in the rain for a few days after applying the\r\ncaustic. The horns of calves a few weeks of age may be removed with a sharp\r\nknife or calf dehorner.\r\n\r\nCHOKING.--This is a common accident in cattle and horses. The object that\r\ncauses the choke may be lodged in the pharynx or oesophagus. Certain\r\nindividuals are more prone to choke while feeding than others. This is\r\nbecause of their habit of eating greedily, and swallowing hastily without\r\nproperly mixing the bolus with the saliva. For this reason, choking occurs\r\nwhen the animal is eating dry feed. Cattle frequently become choked on\r\npieces of such food as roots and apples that are too large to readily pass\r\ndown the oesophagus. Sharp objects taken in with the food sometimes become\r\nlodged in the oesophagus or pharynx.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ differ in complete and partial choke. In the latter, the\r\nsymptoms are not very characteristic. The animal may stop feeding, but\r\nshows very little evidence of suffering pain. It may be able to swallow a\r\nlittle water. On attempting to drink, a part of the water may be returned\r\nthrough the nose, the same as in complete choke. Ineffectual efforts to\r\nswallow, salivation, coughing, hurried respiration, and an anxious\r\nexpression of the face occur in complete choke. Bloating may complicate\r\nthis accident in ruminants. After partial choke has persisted for a day or\r\ntwo, the animal appears dejected or distressed. Pressure on the trachea by\r\nhard objects may cause difficult respiration.\r\n\r\nMechanical pneumonia sometimes occurs. This is due to the food and water\r\nthat the animal may attempt to swallow, being returned to the pharynx and\r\npassed into the air passages and lungs.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is as follows: Animals that have choked should not be given\r\naccess to feed of any kind. Any attempt to take food or drink water may\r\nresult in pneumonia. It may be necessary to drench the animal with a very\r\nsmall quantity of water for the purpose of diagnosis. The most common form\r\nof choke in horses is that due to accumulation of dry food in the\r\noesophagus. The administration of a drug that stimulates the secretion of\r\nsaliva is a very successful method of relieving this form of choke.\r\nPilocarpine is the drug commonly used. Cheap whips should not be introduced\r\ninto the oesophagus for the purpose of dislodging the foreign body. There\r\nis always danger of the whip becoming broken off, and the broken part\r\nlodging in the oesophagus. Neither should such rigid objects as a broom or\r\nrake handle be introduced, because of the danger from serious injury to the\r\nwalls of the pharynx and oesophagus. The flexible probang, which is usually\r\nmade of spiral wire covered with leather, is a very useful instrument to\r\nrelieve choke when in the hands of an experienced operator. If the object\r\ncausing the choke is situated in the neck portion of the oesophagus, it may\r\nsometimes be moved forward, or toward the stomach by pressure with the\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nCASTRATION.--The castration of the male is a common operation in domestic\r\nanimals. The purpose of the operation is to render the animal more useful\r\nfor work or meat production.\r\n\r\n_The age_ at which the operation is performed varies in the different\r\nspecies. The colt is usually castrated when he is one year old, and the\r\ncalf, pig and lamb when a few weeks or a few months of age. It is not\r\nadvisable to castrate the young at weaning time. The operation and the\r\nweaning together may temporarily check the growth of the animal. Colts that\r\nare undeveloped and in poor flesh, or affected with colt distemper, should\r\nbe allowed to recover before they are operated on. In all animals, it is\r\nadvisable to wait until after they have recovered from disease and become\r\nthrifty and strong.\r\n\r\nThe spring, early summer and fall are the most suitable seasons for\r\ncastrating the young. It may be practised during the hot or cold months of\r\nthe year with little danger from wound infection or other complications,\r\nproviding the necessary after-attention can be given.\r\n\r\n_The preparation of the animal_ for the operation by withholding all feed\r\nfor about twelve hours is very advisable. If this is practised, the stomach\r\nand intestines are not distended with feed, and the young are cleaner,\r\neasier to handle and suffer less from castration. Clean quarters and\r\nsurroundings are very necessary to the success of the operation.\r\n\r\n_The instruments required_ are sharp knives, preferably a heavy scalpel and\r\na probe-pointed bistoury, an emasculator for large and mature animals, and\r\nsurgeon's needles and suture material. Ropes and casting harness are\r\nfrequently used for confining and casting the large and mature animals. Two\r\nclean pans or pails filled with a two per cent water solution of liquor\r\ncresolis compositus, or an equally reliable disinfectant, should be\r\nprovided for cleaning the scrotum and neighboring parts and the\r\ninstruments. Pieces of absorbent cotton or oakum may be used in washing and\r\ncleaning the scrotum. The instruments should be sterilized in boiling water\r\nbefore using.\r\n\r\n_If a number of pigs or lambs_ are to be castrated, it is best to confine\r\nthem in a small, clean, well-bedded pen. This enables the attendant to\r\ncatch them quickly and without unnecessary excitement or exercise. They\r\nshould be taken to an adjoining pen to be castrated. The scrotum should be\r\nwashed with the disinfectant, and the testicles pressed tightly against the\r\nscrotal wall. An incision parallel with the middle line or raphe and a\r\nlittle to one side is made through the skin and the coverings of the\r\ntesticle, and the testicle pressed out through the incision. The testicle\r\nand cords are then pulled well out and the cord broken off with a quick\r\njerk and twist, or scraped off with a knife. The latter method is to be\r\npreferred in large lambs if the operator does not have an emasculator. The\r\nincision in the scrotum should be extended from its base to the lowest\r\npart, in order to secure perfect drainage.\r\n\r\n_Young calves_ may be castrated in the standing position or when cast and\r\nheld on the side. The method of operating is the same as recommended for\r\npigs and lambs.\r\n\r\n_The castration of the colt_ may be performed in either the standing\r\nposition or when cast. The method of operating is the same as practised in\r\nthe smaller animals with the exception of cutting off the cord. The\r\nemasculator is used here. This instrument crushes the stump of the cord and\r\nprevents haemorrhage from the cut ends of the blood-vessels. Careful\r\naseptic precautions must be observed in operating on colts, as they are\r\nvery susceptible to wound infection and peritonitis.\r\n\r\nThe blood-vessels of the testicular cord are larger in the adult animals,\r\nand the danger from haemorrhage is greater than in the young. For this\r\nreason, it is advisable to use an emasculator in castrating all mature\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nComplications Following Castration.--The _haemorrhage_ from the wound and\r\nstump of cord is usually unimportant in the young animals. Serious\r\nhaemorrhage from the vessels of the cord sometimes occur in the adult, and\r\na persistent haemorrhage results when a subcutaneous vein is cut in making\r\nthe incision in the scrotum. This complication is not usually serious, and\r\ncan be prevented and controlled by observing proper precautions in cutting\r\noff the cord, or by picking up the cut ends of the vessel and ligating it.\r\nPacking the scrotal sack with sterile gauze or absorbent cotton, and\r\nclosing the incision with sutures may be practised for the purpose of\r\nstopping this form of haemorrhage. The packing should be removed in about\r\ntwelve hours.\r\n\r\n_The infection of the wound_ always follows castration. If the incision is\r\nsmall and the operation is followed by swelling of the neighboring tissues,\r\nthe clotted blood, wound secretions and pus become penned up in the scrotal\r\nsack. Local blood poisoning or peritonitis follows. This is not an uncommon\r\ncomplication. It can be prevented by aseptic precautions in operating, and\r\ninsuring good drainage by extending the incision to the lowest part of the\r\nscrotal sac. The scrotal sac always contracts down and becomes more or less\r\nswollen within a day or two following castration. We must keep this in mind\r\nwhen enlarging the opening, and be sure and make it plenty large to permit\r\nthe escape of the infectious matter. In castrating sheep, all wool in the\r\nregion of the scrotal sac should be clipped off, as this interferes with\r\ndrainage from the wound.\r\n\r\n_Exercise following castration_ is almost as essential as clean quarters.\r\nLack of exercise leads to _oedematous swelling_ in the region of the\r\nscrotum, and the lips of the incision may become adhered if the animal is\r\nat rest. Colts and all mature animals that are confined in close quarters\r\nshould be examined within forty-eight hours following the operation, and\r\nthe condition of the wound noted. If closed, the hands should be cleaned\r\nand disinfected, and the adhesion broken down with the fingers. It is best\r\nto exercise horses daily.\r\n\r\nIt is unsafe to expose castrated animals to cold, damp, chilly weather. The\r\nshock and soreness resulting from the operation render the animal highly\r\nsusceptible to pleurisy and pneumonia. This is especially true of young\r\ncolts.\r\n\r\n_Inguinal hernia_ or \"_rupture_\" may complicate the operation. This form of\r\nhernia is quite frequently met with in pigs, and only occasionally in the\r\nother animals. This complication is usually overcome by practising what is\r\ncommonly termed the covered operation. The pig is usually held or hung up\r\nby the hind legs. A larger animal is placed on its back. The hernia is\r\nreduced by manipulating the mass of intestines with the fingers, so that\r\nthey drop back into the abdominal cavity. The part is carefully cleaned and\r\ndisinfected and an incision made through the scrotal wall, and the thin\r\ncovering or serous sac in which the testicle is lodged is exposed. The\r\ntesticle with the cord and covering is drawn well out of the scrotum and\r\nheld by an attendant. The operator then passes a needle carrying a strong\r\nsilk thread through the cord and covering, below the point where he intends\r\nsevering it. The needle is removed and the cord and covering ligated at\r\nthis point. The cord is then cut off about one-half an inch from the\r\nligature, and the incision in the scrotum made plenty large in order to\r\ninsure drainage.\r\n\r\nIt is very essential to the success of this operation that the animal be\r\ndieted for twelve or eighteen hours before attempting to operate. The\r\nafter-treatment consists in giving the animal separate quarters and feeding\r\na light diet.\r\n\r\n_Enlarged or scirrhous cords_ follow infection of the wound, usually with\r\nspores of a certain fungus (_Botryomyces_). This complication more often\r\nfollows castration of cattle and pigs than of colts. Wrong methods of\r\noperating, such as leaving the stump of the cord too long and insufficient\r\ndrainage for the pus and wound secretions, are the factors that favor this\r\ncomplication. Scirrhous cords or fibrous tumors should be dissected out and\r\nremoved before they have become large and begun breaking down.\r\n\r\nCASTRATION OF RIDGELING OR CRYPTORCHID ANIMALS.--In the ridgeling animal\r\none or both of the testicles have not descended into the scrotal sac, and\r\nare usually lodged in the inguinal canal or abdominal cavity. If the\r\ntesticle is lodged in the inguinal canal the animal is termed a \"flanker.\"\r\nIn yearling colts the testicular cord is sometimes short, and the testicle\r\nis situated high up in the scrotum and inguinal canal. In examining a\r\nsupposed cryptorchid colt, he should be twitched. This may cause the\r\ntesticle to descend into the scrotum.\r\n\r\nThe castration of a true cryptorchid requires a special operation. When\r\nproperly performed and the animal given special after-care, the operation\r\nis not followed by any serious complications. An abnormally large, diseased\r\ntesticle is sometimes met with that cannot be removed in the usual way, and\r\nwhich complicates and increases the difficulty of operating.\r\n\r\nCAPONIZING.--The castration or caponizing of the male chicken is commonly\r\npractised in certain localities. This operation changes the disposition of\r\nthe cockerel. He becomes more quiet and sluggish, never crows, the head is\r\nsmall, the comb and wattles cease growing and the hackle and saddle\r\nfeathers become well developed. A capon always develops more uniformly and\r\nis larger than the cockerel.\r\n\r\n_The best time to caponize the cockerel_ is when he weighs between two or\r\nthree pounds. If older and heavier, the testicle becomes so large that it\r\nis very difficult to remove, and the danger from tearing the spermatic\r\nartery and a fatal haemorrhage resulting is greater.\r\n\r\nThere are several kinds of _caponizing instruments_. They may be purchased\r\nin sets. Each set should contain an instrument for removing the testicle; a\r\nknife for making the incision through the abdominal wall; a sharp hook for\r\ntearing through the thin membrane; spring spreader for holding the lips of\r\nthe incision apart; a blunt probe for keeping the intestines out of the way\r\nof the operator; and a pair of tweezers for removing clots of blood. The\r\ndifferent instruments for removing the testicles are a spoon-like scoop,\r\nspoon forceps and cannula. The spoon-like scoop is preferred by most\r\noperators.\r\n\r\n_The cockerel_ is confined for the operation by passing a strong noose of\r\ncord around both legs, and a second noose around the wings close to the\r\nbody, that have weights fastened to them. The cords pass through holes or\r\nloops in a barrel or board that is used for an operating table. This holds\r\nthe cockerel firmly and prevents his struggling.\r\n\r\n_The bird should be prepared_ for the operation by withholding all feed and\r\nwater for a period of twenty-four hours or longer, for the purpose of\r\nemptying out the intestine. The operator must have a strong light, in order\r\nto work quickly and safely. Direct sunlight or electric light should be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe instruments should be placed in a two per cent water solution of\r\ncarbolic acid. A second vessel containing a two per cent water solution of\r\nliquor cresolis compound for cleaning the skin is necessary. Absorbent\r\ncotton should be used for washing the wound.\r\n\r\n_The general method of operating_ is as follows: The incision is made\r\nbetween the last two ribs and in front of the thigh. The feathers over this\r\nregion should be removed, and the skin pulled to one side before making the\r\nincision. An incision about one and one-half inches in length is made\r\nthrough the skin and muscles, and the spreader inserted. The sharp hook is\r\nthen inserted and the thin serous membrane over the intestine is torn\r\nthrough. The testicles are situated in the superior portion of the\r\nabdominal cavity or under the back. On pushing the intestines to one side,\r\nboth testicles, which are about the size of a bean and yellowish in color,\r\ncan be seen. The lower one should be removed first. After removing both\r\ntesticles, blood clots, feathers, or any foreign body that may have gotten\r\ninto the wound should be picked up with the tweezers before removing the\r\nspreaders and allowing the wound to close. No special after-treatment is\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n_The most common complication_ is rupture of the spermatic artery. This\r\noccurs at the time the testicle is torn loose and may be due to careless\r\nmethods, or operating on cockerels that are too large. If all of the\r\ntesticle is not removed from the abdominal cavity, the bird is termed a\r\n\"slip.\" Sometimes air puffs form after the operation. These should be\r\npunctured with a sharp knife.\r\n\r\nOVARIOTOMY, \"SPAYING.\"--The removal of the ovaries, or ovariotomy, is\r\npractised for the purpose of rendering the female more useful for meat\r\nproduction, prolonging the period of lactation, overcoming vicious habits\r\nand preventing oestrum or heat. The operation is commonly performed in the\r\nheifer and bitch, occasionally in the mare, and at present rarely in the\r\nsow.\r\n\r\n_Heifers_ are usually spayed between the ages of eight and twelve months;\r\nthe _bitch_ and _sow_ when a few months old, or before the periods of heat\r\nhave begun. The _mare_ is spayed when mature. It is possible to spay the\r\nfemale at any age, but the ages mentioned are the most convenient. Pregnant\r\nanimals should not be operated on. The season of the year makes little\r\ndifference in the results, providing the animal can be kept under close\r\nobservation and given the necessary care and treatment. The spring of the\r\nyear, just before turning the herd on pasture, is the best season to spay\r\nheifers.\r\n\r\n_All animals should be prepared_ for the operation by withholding all feed\r\nfor at least twenty-four hours before they are operated on, and it may be\r\nadvisable to give them a physic. It is easier to operate when the\r\nintestinal tract is comparatively empty, and the death rate is lower than\r\nwhen the animal is not properly prepared for the operation.\r\n\r\n_The method of operating_ is not the same in the different species. In\r\nyoung heifers and sows, the flank operation is preferred, and in mares and\r\ncows, the vaginal operation. The median line operation is practised in\r\nbitches. A spaying emasculator, or ecraseur, are the special instruments\r\nneed for removing the ovaries.\r\n\r\nThe animal must be properly confined for the operation. Heifers are usually\r\nheld in the standing position by fastening the head securely, and crowding\r\nthe left side of the animal against a solid board partition, or side of a\r\nchute. If the vaginal operation is performed, the mare or cow may be\r\nconfined in stocks. The bitch is usually anesthetized and placed on her\r\nback on a table that is inclined, so that the hind parts are elevated.\r\n\r\nOvariotomy cannot be successfully performed by an untrained and\r\ninexperienced operator. The necessary precautions against the infection of\r\nthe part must be observed, in order to promote the healing of the wound and\r\nprevent peritonitis. The seat of the operation should be carefully cleaned\r\nand disinfected.\r\n\r\n_Following the operation_ the animal should be fed a spare diet for a few\r\ndays. This is a very necessary part of the care of the bitch. The general\r\ncondition of the animal should be noted daily until there is no further\r\ndanger from wound infection. Healing is usually completed in from seven to\r\ntwelve days. The sutures should then be removed, and if stitch abscesses\r\noccur, the part should be washed with a disinfectant.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. What is the purpose of dehorning cattle?

Species\r\nthat are unable to live independently of a host and are permanent parasites\r\nare usually the most injurious to the animal. This is especially true of\r\nparasites that are capable of puncturing the skin or burrowing into it.\r\nTemporary parasites may cause fatal forms of disease. This is true of the\r\nlarva? of the sheep bot-fly, which develop in the sinuses of the head,\r\ncausing severe inflammation of these parts, nervous symptoms and death. The\r\ncharacter of the symptoms of a parasitic disease depends on the habits of\r\nthe parasite, and the tissue or organ, that it may attack.\r\n\r\nThe parasitic flies belong to the order _Diptera_, and the families\r\n_Muscidae_ and _OEstridae_. Fleas belong to the sub-order _Pulicidae_. The\r\norder _Hemiptera_ includes the lice, and the most important families are\r\n_Pediculidae_ and _Ricinidae_. Mites and ticks belong to the order\r\n_Acarina_. The most important parasites belonging to this order are the\r\n_Sarcoptidae_ and _Ixodidae_.\r\n\r\nOESTRIDAE.--The three common bot-flies are the _Gastrophilus equi_,\r\n_Hypoderma lineata_ and _OEstrus ovis_. These flies are important because\r\nof the parasitic habits of their larva. They inhabit the stomach and\r\nintestines of horses (Fig. 62); the subcutaneous tissue and skin of cattle;\r\nand the sinuses of the head and nasal cavities of sheep.\r\n\r\n_The common bot-fly of the horse_ (_G. equi_) has a heavy, hairy body. Its\r\ncolor is brown, with dark and yellowish spots. The female fly can be seen\r\nduring the warm weather, hovering around the horse, and darting toward the\r\nanimal for the purpose of depositing the egg. The color of the egg is\r\nyellow, and it adheres firmly to the hair. It hatches in from two to four\r\nweeks, and the larva reaches the mouth through the animal licking the part.\r\nFrom the mouth, it passes to the stomach, where it attaches itself to the\r\ngastric mucous membrane (Fig. 62). Here it remains until fully developed,\r\nwhen it becomes detached and is passed out with the fasces. The third stage\r\nis passed in the ground. This takes place in the spring and early summer\r\nand lasts for several weeks, when it finally emerges a mature fly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--A piece of the wall of the horse's stomach showing\r\nthe bot-fly larvae attached.]\r\n\r\n_The bot-fly of the ox_ (_H. lineata_) is dark in color and about the size\r\nof a honey-bee. On warm days, the female may be seen depositing eggs on the\r\nbody of the animal, especially in the region of the heels. This seems to\r\ngreatly annoy the animal, and it is not uncommon for cattle to become\r\nstampeded. The egg reaches the mouth through the animal licking the part.\r\nThe saliva dissolves the shell of the egg and the larva is freed. It then\r\nmigrates from the gullet, wanders about in the tissue until finally it may\r\nreach a point beneath the skin of the back. Here the larva matures and\r\nforms the well-known swelling or warble. In the spring of the year it works\r\nout through the skin. The next stage is spent in the ground. The pupa state\r\nlasts several weeks, when the mature fly issues forth.\r\n\r\n_The bot-fly of sheep_ (_O. ovis_) resembles an overgrown house-fly. Its\r\ngeneral color is brown, and it is apparently lazy, flying about very\r\nlittle. This bot-fly makes its appearance when the warm weather begins, and\r\ndeposits live larvae in the nostrils of sheep. This act is greatly feared\r\nby the animals, as shown by their crowding together and holding the head\r\ndown. The larva works up the nasal cavities and reaches the sinuses of the\r\nhead, where it becomes attached to the lining mucous membrane. In the\r\nspring, when fully developed, it passes out through the nasal cavities and\r\nnostrils, drops to the ground, buries itself, and in from four to six weeks\r\ndevelops into the mature fly.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF BOT-FLY DISEASES.--The larvae of the bot-fly of the horse do\r\nnot cause characteristic symptoms of disease. Work horses that are groomed\r\ndaily are not hosts for a large number of \"bots,\" but young and old horses\r\nthat are kept in a pasture or lot and seldom groomed may become unthrifty\r\nand \"pot bellied,\" or show symptoms of indigestion.\r\n\r\nCattle suffer much pain from the development of the larva of the _H.\r\nlineata_. During the spring of the year, the pain resulting from the\r\npresence of the larvae beneath the skin and the penetration of the skin is\r\nmanifested by excitement and running about. Besides the loss in milk and\r\nbeef production, there is a heavy yearly loss from the damage to hides.\r\n\r\nThe parasitic life of the bot-fly of sheep results in a severe catarrhal\r\ninflammation of the mucous membrane lining the sinuses of the head, and a\r\ndischarge of a heavy, pus-like material from the nostrils. The irritation\r\nproduced by the larvae may be so serious at times as to result in nervous\r\nsymptoms and death.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF BOT-FLY DISEASES.--The treatment of the different bot-fly\r\ndiseases is largely preventive. This consists in either the destruction of\r\nthe eggs or the larvae.\r\n\r\nThe different methods of destroying the eggs of the bot-fly of the horse\r\nare clipping the hair from the part, scraping off the eggs with a sharp\r\nknife, or destroying them by washing the part infested with eggs with a two\r\nor three per cent water solution of carbolic acid. This should be practised\r\nevery two weeks during the period when the female deposits the eggs.\r\n\r\nHousing the cattle, or applying water solutions of certain preparations to\r\nthe skin that may keep the female from depositing eggs, may be practised\r\nfor the prevention of the ox-warble. The most practical method of ridding\r\ncattle of this pest is to destroy the larvae. This can be done by examining\r\neach animal and locating the swelling or warble and injecting a few drops\r\nof kerosene into the opening in the skin. A better method is to enlarge the\r\nopening in the skin with a sharp knife, squeeze out the grub and destroy\r\nit. This should be practised in late winter and early spring.\r\n\r\nThe application of pine tar to the nostrils of sheep is the most practical\r\nmethod of preventing \"grub in the head.\" This should be practised every few\r\ndays during the summer months. A very good preventive measure is plenty of\r\nshade for the flock. Valuable animals may be treated by trephining into the\r\nhead sinus and removing the \"grub.\"\r\n\r\nLICE.--The sucking lice belong to the genus _Hoematopinus_, and the biting\r\nlice of mammals belong to the genus _Trichodectes_. Different species of\r\nsucking and biting lice occur on the different species of farm animals.\r\nPoultry act as hosts for many different species of biting lice belonging to\r\nthe following genuses: _Lipiurus, Goniodes, Goniocotes_ and _Menopon_.\r\n\r\n_The common sucking lice_ occurring on animals are the large-headed horse\r\nlouse, _H. macrocephalus_; the long-nosed ox louse, _H. tenuirostris_; the\r\nlarge-bellied ox louse, _H. curysternus_; the _H. stenopses_ of sheep; _H.\r\nsuis_ of swine; and the _H. piliferus_ of the dog.\r\n\r\nThe _common biting lice_ (Fig. 63) that are found on domestic animals are\r\nthe _T. pilosus_ and _T. pubescens_ of solipeds, _T. scalaris_ of the ox,\r\n_T. spoerocephalus_ of sheep and goats, _T. latus_ and _T. subrostratus_ of\r\nthe dog and cat. _Menopon palidum, Lipiurus variabilis_ and _Gonoides\r\ndissimilis_ are the common lice found on poultry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--Biting louse.]\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS OF LICE.--The symptoms of lousiness depend on the variety of lice\r\npresent, the degree to which the animal is infested with them, its physical\r\ncondition and the care that it receives. Lice multiply more rapidly and\r\ncause greater loss during the winter months than they do in the summer,\r\nwhen the animals are not housed and the opportunity for infection from the\r\nsurroundings is not so great. The sucking louse (Fig. 64) is the most\r\ninjurious and irritating. The irritation and loss of blood that the animal\r\nmay suffer when badly infested by this parasite may result in marked\r\nunthriftiness. Young and old animals that are not well cared for suffer\r\nmost. The biting louse may bite through the superficial layer of the skin,\r\nand cause the animal to bite and rub the part. This irritation to the skin\r\nprevents the animal from becoming rested, and after a time seriously\r\ninterferes with its thriftiness.\r\n\r\n_Horses and mules_ show a staring, dirty, rough coat. The mane and tail may\r\nbecome broken and matted. The animal rubs against the stall, fences and\r\ntrees, and bites the skin in its efforts to relieve the irritation. On\r\nexamining the coat, nits are found adhering to the hair (Fig. 65). We\r\nshould examine the parts of the skin covered by the long hair for the\r\nsucking lice; and the withers, abdomen and limbs for the biting lice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Sucking louse (much enlarged).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--Nits attached to hair (much enlarged).]\r\n\r\n_The symptoms of lousiness in cattle_ are about the same as occur in\r\nhorses. Licking and rubbing the skin are prominent symptoms in cattle, and\r\nthe coat becomes dirty and rough. The licked part is matted and curled. The\r\nlice may be discovered by parting the hair along the back and rump.\r\n\r\n_The biting louse of sheep_ causes the fleece to become matted and tufts of\r\nwool are pulled out. This is brought about by the sheep rubbing and\r\nnibbling the fleece, and the lice cutting through the wool. The loss due to\r\nthe damage to the fleece is usually greater than that resulting from\r\nunthriftiness.\r\n\r\n_The hog-louse_ is the largest specie known. As well as the largest, it is\r\nthe most common of all lice found on domestic animals. The favorite points\r\nof attack are the under surface of the body, the neck and the inside of the\r\nthighs. The irritation and itching are severe, and the hog rubs and\r\nscratches the skin. Young hogs suffer most from this parasite, and their\r\nthriftiness is greatly interfered with.\r\n\r\nThe long-haired breeds of _dogs_ suffer more from lice than the\r\nshort-haired breeds. The almost constant scratching and biting of the skin\r\nresult in its becoming badly irritated and scabby. The symptoms differ\r\nlittle from irritation to the skin caused by fleas, but the presence of\r\nbiting or sucking lice enables the person making the examination to\r\ndetermine the cause of the irritation.\r\n\r\nLice are the most common parasites of _poultry_. It is uncommon to meet\r\nwith a flock of fowls that are not hosts for one or more of the many\r\ndifferent varieties of bird lice. Restlessness, picking, scratching,\r\nflapping the wings, abandoning the nest and loss of condition are common\r\nsymptoms. Young birds suffer most from lice. This is especially true of\r\nyoung chickens, death frequently resulting. Old fowls may show little\r\ninconvenience unless badly infested. The finding of the lice with the head\r\nimbedded in the skin or on the feathers enables the person making the\r\nexamination to positively diagnose the case. The head, back, region of the\r\nvent and beneath the wings are the parts that should be carefully examined\r\nfor lice.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF LOUSINESS.--The preventive treatment is very important. This\r\nconsists in carefully examining all animals or birds that have been\r\npurchased recently, and if found to harbor lice, excluding them from the\r\nherd or flock until after they have been properly treated.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to rid animals of lice if the quarters are thoroughly\r\ncleaned and disinfected. This is necessary in order to destroy lice that\r\nhave become scattered about by the lousy animals, and prevent the\r\nreinfection of the treated animals. The best method to use in cleaning the\r\nquarters is to remove all litter and manure from the stable or houses and\r\ntheir immediate surroundings. It should be burned, or hauled to a field or\r\nlot where other animals cannot come in contact with it for a few months.\r\nThe walls, floors and partitions should be sprayed with a three per cent\r\nwater solution of liquor cresolis compositus. Lime may be scattered about\r\nthe buildings, yards and runs. The most satisfactory method of destroying\r\nlice on the bodies of animals is by washing or dipping in a water solution\r\nor mixture of some reliable disinfectant or oil.\r\n\r\n_Running hogs through a dipping tank_ that contains a one or two per cent\r\nwater solution of liquor cresolis compositus, or a coal tar disinfectant,\r\nor that has from three-fourths to one and one-half inches of oil on top of\r\nthe water, is the most satisfactory method of destroying the hog louse.\r\nBecause of the thinness of the hog's coat and the danger from irritating\r\nthe skin when strong solutions of a disinfectant are used, most swine\r\nbreeders prefer crude oil as a remedy for lousiness in hogs. Crude oil may\r\nbe applied to the bodies of hogs with a swab. If this method is practised\r\ninstead of dipping, it is advisable to crowd the hogs into a small pen, and\r\napply the oil in front and between the thighs and back of the arms. This\r\nmay be practised during the cold weather when it is impossible to dip the\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n_Horses_ may be washed with a one or two per cent water solution of liquor\r\ncresolis compositus, or a coal tar disinfectant. If the weather is cold, it\r\nis advisable to pick a sunny day, and blanket the animal after rubbing it\r\nas dry as possible in order to prevent chilling and catching cold.\r\n\r\n_Cattle_ may be treated in the same manner as horses. Mercurial ointment\r\nrubbed in small amounts on the skin back of the horns and ears, where the\r\nanimal cannot lick it, is a common remedy. The absorption of a small amount\r\nof this drug does the animal no harm, but a larger quantity may salivate\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Sheep_ are treated by dipping in a water solution of a reliable coal tar\r\ndisinfectant. This should not be practised during cold weather, as the\r\nfleece does not dry out. Insect powder may be dusted into the fleece when\r\nit is impossible to dip the animal.\r\n\r\nA very satisfactory treatment for lousiness in _dogs_ and _cats_ is to wash\r\nthem with carbolized soap. We should wait a few minutes before rinsing off\r\nthe soapy lather and drying the coat.\r\n\r\nA number of different remedies are used for the treatment of lousiness in\r\n_poultry_. Dust baths and insect powder are recommended. Ointments are\r\ncommonly used. One part sulfur and four parts vaseline, or lard, may be\r\nmade into an ointment and applied to the head, neck, under the wings and\r\naround the vent. Mercurial ointment may be applied to the margin of the\r\nvent. Neither of them should be used for destroying lice on young chicks.\r\nMercurial ointment should be used very carefully because of its poisonous\r\neffect. Lard may be used for destroying lice on young chicks. Crude\r\npetroleum may be sprayed among the feathers by a hand-sprayer, while the\r\nfowls are suspended by the feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66--Sheep-tick.]\r\n\r\nNone of the disinfectants and oils recommended for dipping and washing\r\nlousy animals destroy the nits. This makes it necessary to re-treat the\r\nanimal in from eight to ten days after the first treatment.\r\n\r\nTHE SHEEP-TICK.--This is not a true tick. It resembles a fly more than it\r\ndoes a tick, and its right name is _Melophagus ovinus_ (Fig. 66). Louse-fly\r\nis a better name for this parasite than tick, as its entire life is spent\r\non the body of a sheep. The general color of the body is brown. The legs\r\nare stout, covered with hair and armed with hooks at their extremities. The\r\nmouth parts consist of a tubular, toothed proboscis with which the parasite\r\npunctures the skin and sucks the blood. Within a few hours after birth, the\r\nlarvae develop into pupae, which are hard, dark brown in color and firmly\r\nglued to the wool. The young louse-fly emerges from the pupa in from three\r\nto four weeks.\r\n\r\nThe sheep-tick is a very common external parasite. The adult parasites and\r\nthe pupae are large and easily found. When badly infested with ticks, a\r\nsheep will rub, dig and scratch the skin and fleece. This results in pieces\r\nof wool becoming pulled out and the fleece appears ragged. After clipping\r\nthe ticks migrate from the ewes to the lambs, which may become unthrifty\r\nand weak.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ consists in dipping the flock in a one or two per cent\r\nwater solution of a coal-tar dip. Dips containing arsenic are most\r\neffective in ridding sheep of ticks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Sheep scab mite, ventral view. (From Farmers'\r\nBulletin No. 159, United States Department of Agriculture.)]\r\n\r\nSCABIES.--This parasitic disease is one of the oldest and most prevalent\r\ndiseases of the skin. It is commonly known as scab or mange. The animals\r\nmost commonly affected are sheep, horses and cattle.\r\n\r\n_The disease is caused_ by _small mites_ or _acari_ that are naturally\r\ndivided into the _Sarcoptes_, which burrow under the epidermis, forming\r\ngalleries; the _Psoroptes_, which live on the surface of the skin where\r\nthey are sheltered by scabs and scurf; and the _Symbiotes_, which also live\r\non the surface of the skin, but prefer the regions of the hind feet and\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nAcari multiply rapidly and live their entire life on the body of the host.\r\nA new generation is produced in about fifteen days. Gerlach has estimated\r\nthe natural increase in three months at 1,000,000 females and 500,000\r\nmales. Scab and mange are exceedingly contagious diseases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Sheep scab.]\r\n\r\n_Common sheep scab_ is caused by that specie of mites known as the\r\n_Psoroptes communis var. ovis_ (Fig. 67). Any part of the body may become\r\naffected. The bites of the mites greatly irritate the skin, and the animal\r\nscratches, bites and rubs the part in its effort to relieve the intense\r\nitching. The skin becomes inflamed and scabby, the wool is pulled and\r\nrubbed out, and the fleece becomes ragged (Fig. 68). By pulling wool out of\r\nthe newly infested area, or collecting skin scrapings and placing this\r\nmaterial on black paper in a sunny, warm place, the mites may be seen\r\ncrawling over the paper. This method of diagnosis should be resorted to in\r\nall suspicious cases of skin disease, and before the disease has developed\r\nto any great extent.\r\n\r\nThe mite that most commonly causes _mange in cattle_ is the _Psoroptes\r\ncommunis var. bovis_. It may invade the skin in the different regions of\r\nthe body, but it is in the regions of the tail and thighs that the first\r\nevidence of the mange is noticed. The animal rubs, scratches, and licks the\r\npart. The itching is intense. The hair over the part is lost and the skin\r\nappears inflamed, thickened, moist, or covered with white crusts. Cracks\r\nand sores may form in the skin. The examination of scrapings from the\r\ninflamed skin should be practised in order to confirm the diagnosis.\r\n\r\n_Mange in horses_ may be caused by either psoroptic or sarcoptic mites.\r\n_Psoroptes communis var. equi_ seems to be the more common parasite. The\r\nitching is intense. The inflamed areas are small at first and scattered\r\nover the regions of the rump, back and neck (Fig. 69). After a time the\r\nsmall areas come together and form large patches, and further spreading of\r\nthe inflammation results from grooming, scratching and biting the skin.\r\nScattered, elevated eruptions on the skin from which the hair has dropped\r\nout are first noticed. These parts may show yellowish scabs. Later the skin\r\nis thickened, smooth, wrinkled, cracked, or covered with sores. Scrapings\r\nmade from the inflamed areas of the skin may show the psoroptic mites.\r\n\r\n_Mange in hogs_ is comparatively rare. It is caused by one of the sarcoptic\r\nmites. The thin portions of the skin are usually first invaded. There are\r\nviolent itching and rubbing, and small, red elevations occur on the skin in\r\nthe region of the ears, eyelids or inner surface of the thighs, depending\r\non the part first invaded. The skin becomes greatly thickened and covered\r\nwith crusts and scabs. Pus formation and ulceration may occur.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF SCAB AND MANGE.--A careful inspection of recently purchased\r\nanimals that pass through stockyards, or are shipped from sections where\r\nscab and mange are common skin diseases, is an important preventive\r\nmeasure. Infected animals should be completely isolated from the herd, and\r\nkept apart from other animals until after they have been treated. Hogs that\r\nare slightly infected should be quarantined and treated. If badly affected,\r\nthey should be killed, and the carcass disposed of by burning or burying.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--A severe case of mange.]\r\n\r\n_The different remedies used_ in the treatment of the disease may be\r\napplied by dipping, hand dressing or washing, pouring, smearing and\r\nspotting. The first method is the most satisfactory. The last method may be\r\nused when a small area of the skin is involved, and during the cold\r\nweather. Washing or dipping the animal with a two per cent water solution\r\nof liquor cresolis compositus is an effective remedy for the psoroptic\r\nforms of scab and mange. Tobacco, lime and sulfur, and arsenical dips are\r\nrecommended in the treatment of sheep and cattle. Ointments are recommended\r\nfor animals that are slightly affected with mange. Lime and sulfur dips are\r\nrecommended by the Bureau of Animal Industry. Small infected areas of the\r\nskin may be treated by applying sulfur-iodide ointment. The following\r\nointment is commonly recommended: potassium sulfide ten parts, potassium\r\ncarbonate two parts, and lard three hundred parts.\r\n\r\nSheep cannot be safely dipped for scab during the cold weather. If\r\nthickened and scabby, the skin should be scrubbed with the dip, or the\r\nanimal prepared for dipping or washing by first clipping the hair or wool\r\nand scrubbing the skin with water and a good soap. In order to prevent\r\nreinfection, it is necessary to remove the animal to new quarters, or\r\nthoroughly clean and disinfect the old. It is necessary to wash or spray\r\nthe fences, floors, walls, brushes and curry-combs with a disinfecting\r\nsolution. Manure and other litter should be removed to a place where there\r\nis no danger from its distributing the infection.\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF POULTRY CAUSED BY MITES.--Mites or acarina that cause diseases\r\nof poultry may live on the feathers, beneath the skin, and within the body\r\nof the fowl.\r\n\r\n_The small, red mite (Dermanyssus gallinae)_ remains on the surface of the\r\nbody only when feeding, and spends the rest of the time under collections\r\nof filth and in cracks in the roosts and walls of the house. This parasite\r\ncauses the birds to become restless, emaciated and droopy.\r\n\r\n_A very small mite (Sarcoptes mutans)_ is the cause of scaly leg. It lives\r\nunder the skin. The joints of the feet appear affected, and the foot and\r\nleg become enlarged, roughened and scaly.\r\n\r\n_Depluming scabies_ is caused by _Sarcoptes laevis var. gallinae_. This\r\nmite causes the feathers to break off at the surface of the skin. Masses of\r\nepidermic scales may form around the broken ends of the feathers. The\r\ndiagnosis can be confirmed by examining the skin lesions and finding the\r\nmite.\r\n\r\n_The air sac mite_ (_Cytodites nudus_) may cause sufficient irritation to\r\nthe mucous membrane lining the air sacs to seriously obstruct the air\r\npassages with mucus, or produce death from exhaustion. A post-mortem\r\nexamination of a fowl that has died of this disease shows the mites on the\r\nsurface of the lining membrane of the air-sacs. They appear as a white or\r\nyellow dust.\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF POULTRY DISEASES CAUSED BY MITES.--Diseases of poultry caused\r\nby mites may be prevented by quarantining all recently purchased birds for\r\na period of from two to four weeks, and by keeping the poultry houses\r\nclean. Birds that are found infested with parasites should be destroyed or\r\nreturned. In case the bird is valuable and suffering from external\r\nparasites only, it should be given the necessary treatment.\r\n\r\n_Red mites may be destroyed_ by thoroughly cleaning the poultry house, and\r\nspraying the roosts, nests, walls and floor with a three per cent water\r\nsolution of liquor cresolis compositus. This should be repeated twice a\r\nweek for two weeks.\r\n\r\n_Scaly-leg may be treated_ by applying a penetrating oil to the feet and\r\nlower part of the leg. It is advisable to first remove the scales by\r\nscrubbing the part with soap and warm water. Dipping the feet in a mixture\r\nof kerosene one part and linseed oil two parts is recommended. This should\r\nbe repeated as often as necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Describe the different bot-flies.\r\n\r\n2. Give the life history of the bot-fly of the horse; of the ox; of sheep.\r\n\r\n3. Give the symptoms of bot-fly diseases.\r\n\r\n4. Give the symptoms of lousiness.\r\n\r\n5. Give treatment for lousiness of different farm animals.\r\n\r\n6. What is the damage from the sheep-tick? Give treatment.\r\n\r\n7. Describe the injury from scabies and mange.\r\n\r\n8. Give treatments for these diseases.\r\n\r\n9. Mention the several poultry mites and tell how to treat them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nANIMAL PARASITES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common parasitic diseases of domestic animals are caused by the\r\nfollowing groups of worms: _Flukes_ or _trematoides_; _tapeworms_ or\r\n_Cestoides_; _thorn-headed worms_ or _Acanthocephales_; and _round-worms_\r\nor _Nematoids_. Flat worms, such as tapeworms and flukes, require secondary\r\nhosts. The immature and mature forms of tapeworms are parasites of\r\nvertebrate animals, but an invertebrate host is necessary for the\r\ncompletion of the life cycle of the fluke. The hog is the only specie of\r\ndomestic animals that becomes a host for the thorn-headed worm. The\r\nround-worm is a very common parasite. There are many species belonging to\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--Liver flukes.]\r\n\r\nDISTOMA HEPATICUM (COMMON LIVER FLUKE).--Sheep are the most common hosts\r\nfor this parasite. It is present in the gall ducts and livers, and causes a\r\ndisease of the liver known as liver rot. The liver fluke is flat or\r\nleaf-like and from thirteen to fifteen mm. long (Fig. 70). The head portion\r\nis conical. It has an oval and ventral sucker, and the body is covered with\r\nscaly spines. The eggs are oval and brownish in color.\r\n\r\n_The life history_, in brief, is as follows: Each adult is capable of\r\nproducing an immense number of eggs which are carried down the bile ducts\r\nwith the bile to the intestine, and are passed off with the faeces. Under\r\nfavorable conditions for incubation, such as warm, moist surroundings, the\r\nova or eggs hatch and the _ciliated embryos_ become freed. The embryo next\r\npenetrates into the body of certain snails and encysts. The _sporocyst_, as\r\nit is now called, develops into a third generation known as _redia_ which\r\nescape from the cyst. The _daughter redia_ or _cercaria_, as they are now\r\ntermed, leave the body of the snail and finally become encysted on the\r\nstems of grass, cresses and weeds. When taken into the digestive tract of\r\nthe animal grazing over infested ground, the immature flukes are freed by\r\nthe digestive juices. They then pass from the intestine into the bile\r\nducts. The period of development varies from ten to twenty weeks; each\r\nsporocyst may give rise to from five to eight _redia_ and each redia to\r\nfrom twelve to twenty _cercaria_.\r\n\r\nFluke diseases occur among animals pastured on low, wet, undrained land.\r\nDrying ponds and lakes are the homes of the fresh water snails, and in such\r\nplaces there are plenty of hosts for the immature flukes. Wet seasons favor\r\nthe development of this parasite. Cattle and sheep that pasture on river\r\nbottom land in certain sections of the southern portion of the United\r\nStates are frequently affected with fluke diseases.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms of liver rot of sheep_ may be divided into two stages. The\r\nfirst stage is marked by increase in weight and improved condition. In the\r\nsecond stage of the disease, the animal shows a pale skin and mucous\r\nmembrane, dropsical swellings, loss of flesh and weakness. The character of\r\nthe symptoms of the disease depends on the age of the animals and the care\r\nthat they receive. Young, poorly cared for animals suffer severely from the\r\ndisease, and the death rate is usually heavy. The finding of fluke ova in\r\nthe faeces is conclusive evidence of the nature of the disease. It may be\r\nadvisable to kill one of the sick animals, and determine the nature of the\r\ndisease by a post-mortem examination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--Tapeworm larvae in liver (_Echinococcus\r\npolymorphus_).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Tapeworms.]\r\n\r\n_The treatment is preventive_. Drainage water from a pasture infested with\r\nsnails harboring immature flukes is a source of infection, and should not\r\nbe used as a water supply for cattle and sheep. In sections where the\r\ndisease is prevalent, sheep should not be pastured on low, poorly-drained\r\nland. Such land should be used for pasturing horses and cattle, but if\r\npossible, it should be first drained and cultivated. Careful feeding and\r\ngood care may help the affected animals to recover.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Tapeworm larvae in the peritoneum (_Cysticercus\r\ncellulosa_).]\r\n\r\nTAPEWORMS OR CESTOIDES.--Tapeworms are formed by a chain of segments,\r\njoined together at their ends, and are flat or ribbon-shaped (Fig. 71). The\r\nhead segment is small, and possesses either hooks or suckers. It is by\r\nthese that the worm attaches itself to the lining membrane of the\r\nintestine. The anterior segments are smaller and less mature than the\r\nposterior segments. Each segment is sexually complete, possessing both the\r\nmale and female organs, and when mature, one or more of them break off and\r\nare passed out with the faeces. The mature or ripe segments are filled with\r\nova. On reaching the digestive tract of a proper host, usually with the\r\ndrinking water or fodder, the embryo is freed from the egg. The _armed\r\nembryo_ uses its hooklets in boring its way through the wall of the\r\nintestine. It then wanders through the tissues of its host until it finally\r\nreaches a suitable place for development (Figs. 71 and 73). On coming to\r\nrest, it develops into the larva or bladder-worm, which when eaten by a\r\nproper host gives rise to the mature tapeworm.\r\n\r\nThe following tables give the most important tapeworms:\r\n\r\nADULT FORMS\r\n\r\nName                   Host            Organ\r\n\r\nTaenia expansa         Sheep and ox    Intestine\r\nTaenia fimbriata       Sheep           Liver\r\nTaenia denticulata     Cattle          Intestine\r\nTaenia alba            Cattle          Intestine\r\nTaenia perfoliata      Solipeds        Intestine\r\nTaenia mamillana       Solipeds        Intestine\r\nTaenia echinococcus    Dog             Intestine\r\n\r\nLARVAL FORMS\r\n\r\nName                        Host\r\n\r\nCysticercus bovis           Cattle\r\nCysticercus cellulosa       Swine and man\r\nCysticercus tennicollis     Cattle, sheep and swine\r\nCoenurus cerebralis         Cattle and sheep\r\nEchinococcus polymorphus    Cattle, sheep, swine and man\r\n\r\nThe adult tapeworms _Taeniae saginata_ and _soleum_, of which the\r\n_Cysticerci bovis_ and _cellulosa_ are the larvae forms, occur in man. The\r\nlarvae are present in meat and pork, and this form of parasitism is termed\r\nbeef measles in cattle and pork measles in hogs. Man becomes host for these\r\ntwo forms of tapeworms through eating measly pork or beef that is not\r\nproperly cooked.\r\n\r\nThe dog is the host for _Taeniae marginala_, _coenurus_ and _echinococcus_.\r\nThe larvae forms of these _taeniae_ are the _Cysticercus tennicollis_,\r\n_Coenurus cerebralis_ and _Echinococcus polymorphus_. _C. tennicollis_ is a\r\nparasite of the serous or lining membranes of the body cavities. It is not\r\nof great economic importance. _C. cerebralis_ is a parasite of the brain of\r\nsheep, and may cause a heavy death rate in flocks that are infested with\r\nit. _E. polymorphus_ is a parasite of the liver, but it may occur in other\r\norgans.\r\n\r\nTHE THORN-HEADED WORM OR ACANTHOCEPHALE.--This parasite requires a\r\nsecondary host. In this case a particular species of the May-beetle larva\r\nor white grub that is commonly found about manure piles and in clover\r\npastures is the host. The hog eats a white grub that is host for the larval\r\nform. The digestive juices free the larva, it then becomes attached to the\r\nintestinal mucous membrane and develops into the adult thorn-headed worm\r\n(Fig. 74). This parasite is characterized by a hooked proboscis or thorn at\r\nits anterior extremity, and the absence of a distinct digestive tract. The\r\nmale is much smaller than the female. The eggs are passed out of the\r\nintestine with the faeces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Thorn-headed worms.]\r\n\r\nTHE ROUND-WORMS OR NEMATOIDS.--Round-worms are very common parasites of\r\ndomestic animals (Fig. 75). This group of worms is characterized by their\r\ncylindrical form, the presence of a true digestive canal and the separation\r\ninto two sexes, male and female. The life history is more simple than in\r\nthe flat worms. Intermediate hosts are not required for the development of\r\nthe common forms. The eggs and embryos are deposited by the female in the\r\nintestinal tract, air passages, or excretory ducts of the kidneys of the\r\nhost. Development may be completed here, or the eggs and embryos are passed\r\noff with the body excretions. They may live for a short time outside the\r\nanimal body, or undergo certain development and again infest a host of the\r\nsame species from which they came, through the water, grass and fodder that\r\nthe animal may take into its digestive tract.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Large round-worm in intestine of hog.]\r\n\r\nThe following species of nematoids are common parasites of domestic\r\nanimals:\r\n\r\nSOLIPEDS\r\n\r\n  Species                      Organ\r\nAscaris megalocephala        Intestines\r\nSclerostoma equinum          Large intestine and blood-vessels\r\nSclerostoma tetracanthum     Large intestine\r\nOxyrus curvula               Large intestine\r\nOxyrus mastigodes            Large intestine\r\n\r\nCATTLE\r\n\r\n  Species                      Organ\r\nStrongylus convolutus        Abomasum\r\nAscaris vituli               Small intestine (calves)\r\nStrongylus ventricosus       Small intestine\r\nOesophagostomum inflatum     Large intestine\r\nTrichocephalus affins        Large intestine\r\nStrongylus micrurus          Bronchi\r\nStrongylus pulmonaris        Bronchi\r\n\r\nSHEEP\r\n\r\n  Species                      Organ\r\nHaemonchus contortus         Abomasum\r\nAscaris ovis                 Small intestine\r\nStrongylus filicollis        Small intestine\r\nOesophagostomum columbianum  Intestines\r\nUncinaria cernua             Small intestine\r\nTrichocephalus affins        Large intestine\r\nStrongylus filaria           Bronchi\r\nStrongylus rufescens         Bronchi and air follicles\r\n\r\nSWINE\r\n\r\n  Species                      Organ\r\nAscaris suis                 Intestines\r\nOesophagostomum dentatum     Large intestine\r\nTrichocephalus crenatus      Large intestine\r\nTrichina spiralis            Muscles and intestines\r\nStrongylus paradoxus         Trachea and bronchi\r\nSclerostoma pingencola       Renal fat and kidney\r\n\r\nPOULTRY\r\n\r\n  Species                      Organ\r\nAscaris inflexa              Intestine\r\nSpiroptera hamulosa          Gizzard\r\nHeterakis papillosa          Caecum\r\nSyngamus trachealis          Trachea and bronchi\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL WORMS OF SOLIPEDS.--The large round-worms or ascarides and the\r\nsclerostomes are the most injurious intestinal parasites of solipeds. The\r\n_A. megalocephala_ or large round-worm is from 5 to 15 inches (12 to 35\r\ncm.) long. It may be present in the double colon in such large numbers as\r\nto form an entangled mass that completely fills a portion of the loop in\r\nwhich it is lodged. It may interfere with digestion by obstructing the\r\npassage of alimentary matter, and irritating the intestine.\r\n\r\nThe _S. equinum_ and _S. tetracanthum_ are small worms. The former\r\nsclerostoma is from 0.6 to 1.5 inches (18 to 35 mm.) long, and the latter\r\nis from 0.5 to 0.6 inch (8 to 17 mm.) long. Both sclerostomes attach\r\nthemselves to the lining membrane of the intestine by their mouth parts,\r\nand suck blood. The young _S. equinum_ may live in tumor-like cysts that\r\nthey cause to form in the lining membrane of the intestine. The young worm\r\nmay penetrate the wall of a small blood-vessel as well, and drift into a\r\nlarge vessel, where it may become lodged and undergo partial development.\r\nThe irritation to the blood-vessel results in an inflammation and dilation\r\nof the vessel wall. This is termed verminous aneurism. A portion of the\r\nfibrin-like lining of the aneurism may flake off and drift along in the\r\nblood stream, until finally a vessel that is too small for the floating\r\nparticle or embolus to pass through is reached. The vessel is then plugged\r\nor a thrombus is formed. If the vessel involved by the thrombus happens to\r\nbe a mesenteric vessel, then a loop of intestine has its blood supply cut\r\noff, and colicky pains result. Such colics are dangerous, and may terminate\r\nfatally. Intestinal obstruction, thrombo-embolic colics, unthriftiness and\r\na weakened, anaemic condition may be caused by intestinal worms.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both preventive and medicinal. The preventive treatment\r\nconsists in giving young, growing animals the best care possible.\r\nCleanliness about the stable, giving the colt plenty of range when running\r\nin a pasture, and feeding a ration that is sufficient to keep the colt in\r\ngood physical condition are the important preventive measures. Tartar\r\nemetic in one-half to one dram doses may be given with the feed daily until\r\nfive or six doses are given. Turpentine may be given in one to three ounce\r\ndoses in a pint of linseed oil. This may be repeated daily for two or three\r\ndays. Worms located in the posterior bowel may be removed by rectal\r\ninjections of a weak water infusion of quassia chips. The rectum should be\r\nfirst emptied with the hand, and the nozzle of the syringe carried as far\r\nforward with the hand as possible. The injections should be repeated daily\r\nfor several days.\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL WORMS OF CATTLE.--Intestinal worms seldom cause serious losses\r\nfrom unthriftiness or death in cattle. It is in calves only that we are\r\ncalled on to treat this class of disease. The symptoms resulting from the\r\ninvasion of the intestinal tract by the different worms vary in severity\r\naccording to the number, habits of the parasite and care that the animal\r\nreceives. The usual symptoms are unthriftiness, indigestion, diarrhoea and\r\na stunted, anaemic condition. Stiles reported extreme anaemia,\r\nunthriftiness and many deaths among cattle in a certain section of Texas,\r\ndue to extensive infection with the _Uncinaria radialus_.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is largely preventive. Calves and yearlings should be\r\nprovided with plenty of feed at all seasons of the year. Good care and\r\ncareful feeding will keep them in a thrifty, healthy condition and enable\r\nthem to throw off invasions of intestinal worms. Turpentine is the\r\nvermifuge usually administered to calves. The dose is from two to four\r\ndrams given in a milk or raw linseed oil emulsion.\r\n\r\nSTOMACH WORM OF SHEEP.--The twisted stomach worm, _Haemonchus contortus_,\r\nis the most injurious internal parasite of sheep. It is a very small,\r\nhair-like worm from 0.4 to 1 inch (9 to 25 mm.) in length. In the adult\r\nform it attaches itself to the mucous membrane of the fourth stomach or\r\nabomasum, and lives by sucking blood. The blood present in the digestive\r\ntract of the worm gives it a brown color, and the white oviducts which are\r\nwound around the digestive canal cause the body to appear twisted. When the\r\ntwisted stomach worm is present in large numbers, the worms become mixed\r\nwith the contents of the stomach and can be readily found on making a\r\npost-mortem examination.\r\n\r\n_Symptoms of stomach worms_ are first manifest in the lambs (Fig. 76). It\r\nis not until early summer that the disease appears in the flock. The\r\nsymptoms are not characteristic unless we consider an unthrifty, anaemic,\r\nweak, emaciated condition accompanied by diarrhoea, during the summer\r\nmonths characteristic of stomach-worm disease. The sick animals are unable\r\nto keep up with the flock, and they like to stand about in the shade. They\r\nmove slowly, the back is arched, the appetite poor, the mucous membranes\r\nand skin are pale and the hind parts soiled by the diarrhoeal discharge.\r\nMore acute symptoms than the above sometimes occur. The disease may last\r\nfrom a few days to several weeks. A large percentage of the affected\r\nanimals die.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Lamb affected with stomach worm disease.]\r\n\r\nThe _treatment_ is largely preventive. Frequent changing of pastures and\r\ndry lot feeding are common preventive measures. Permanent sheep pastures\r\nlead to heavy losses from stomach worm disease. A very effective preventive\r\nmeasure, as we may term it, is the practice of administering a vermifuge to\r\nthe ewes in the late summer and again in early winter. This may be given in\r\na drench, or with the feed. This prevents the reinfection of the pastures\r\nevery spring, and the young lambs are not exposed to this form of\r\ninfection. The most effective treatment that the writer has ever used is\r\nthe following formula recommended by Dr. Law: Arsenous acid one dram,\r\nsulfate of iron five drams, powdered areca nut two ounces, common salt four\r\nounces. This is sufficient for one dose for thirty sheep. It may be given\r\nwith the salt, or in ground feed. If the flock is apparently healthy, four\r\ndoses given at intervals of three days is sufficient. If symptoms of\r\nstomach worms are manifested the animals should be dosed daily until they\r\nhave received from five to ten doses, depending on the condition of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL WORMS OF SHEEP.--The most widely distributed and seemingly most\r\ninjurious intestinal worm of sheep is the _OEsopliagostomum columbianum_.\r\nIt is a small worm from 0.5 to 0.75 inch (12 to 18 mm.) long. It penetrates\r\nthe lining membrane of the intestines and encysts in the intestinal wall. A\r\ntumor, varying in size from that of a millet seed to a hazelnut, then forms\r\nin the wall of the intestine. These tumors undergo a cheesy degeneration,\r\nand when mature, may appear as greenish, cheesy-like masses, covering a\r\nlarge portion of the lining membrane of the intestine. Diarrhoea and\r\nemaciation may result. These symptoms are most evident during the winter\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ recommended for ridding sheep of this intestinal worm is\r\nlargely preventive. Very little can be done with the medicinal treatment of\r\na sheep whose intestinal tract is badly infested with this parasite. Good\r\ncare and the feeding of a proper ration are the only curative measures that\r\nare effective in such cases. The occasional administration of a vermifuge\r\nfor the purpose of ridding the digestive tract of worms, together with the\r\nfrequent changing of pastures during the spring and summer, are the most\r\neffective preventive lines of treatment. The same treatment recommended for\r\nstomach worms may be used for this disease.\r\n\r\nINTESTINAL PARASITES OF HOGS.--The _Ascaris suis_ or _common round_ worm is\r\nvery commonly found in the small intestine. It is quite frequently found in\r\nlarge numbers, almost filling the lumen of the intestine of an unthrifty\r\npig (Fig. 75). It may also work its way into the bile duct. Sometimes,\r\nafter a hog has died, this parasite migrates forward into the stomach and\r\ngullet. The _A. suis_ is from 4 to 10 inches (10 to 26 cm.) long.\r\n\r\n_The Echinorhynchus gigas_ or _thorn-headed_ worm is the most dangerous of\r\nall intestinal worms (Fig. 74). It is usually found with its proboscis or\r\nthorn imbedded in the wall of the small intestine. The Echinorhynchus is\r\nnot as common a parasite as the Ascaride, and it is not usually present in\r\nlarge numbers. Usually, not more than a half-dozen of these worms are found\r\nin the intestine of a hog, but in some localities and in hogs that are\r\nallowed to root around manure piles and in clover pastures the herd may\r\nbecome badly infected with them and serious losses occur. The average\r\nlength of the male is about 3 inches (8 cm.) and the female 10 inches (26\r\ncm.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Whip-worms attached to wall of intestine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Pin-worms in intestine.]\r\n\r\nThe _Trichocephalus crenatus_ or _whip worm_ (Fig. 77) is slender or\r\nhair-like in its anterior two-thirds and thick posteriorly. It is from 1.5\r\nto 2 inches (40 to 45 mm.) long. It is found in the caecum attached to the\r\nwall by the hair-like portion.\r\n\r\nThe _OEsophagostomum dentatum_ or _pin worm_ is from 0.3 to 0.6 inch (8 to\r\n15 mm.) long. It is found in the large intestine (Fig. 78).\r\n\r\nThe _symptoms_ of intestinal worms are not very evident in the average\r\ndrove of hogs. None of the other farm animals are such common hosts for\r\nintestinal worms as hogs. But it is only in extreme cases of infection by\r\nintestinal worms, and in stunted and poorly-cared-for hogs, that very\r\nnoticeable symptoms of disease are manifested. We must not take from the\r\nabove statement that it is unnecessary to resort to treatment unless in\r\nexceptional cases. Intestinal worms interfere with the growth of young\r\nhogs, and may irritate and inflame the intestine, causing chronic\r\nindigestion, nervous symptoms, and in some cases death. This irritated and\r\ninflamed condition of the intestine is best noted in the abattoir by the\r\nease with which the wall of the intestine that contains large numbers of\r\nworms tears when handling it.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ of intestinal worms in hogs is both preventive and\r\nmedicinal. If the conditions in the pens and houses are such as to enable\r\nthe eggs and embryos to live for a long time, or the surroundings are\r\nfavorable for infection of the animals through their feed and water supply,\r\nthe herd may become badly infested with intestinal parasites. The\r\npreventive treatment consists in keeping hogs in clean, well-drained yards\r\nor pastures, and feeding them from clean troughs and concrete feeding\r\nfloors that can be washed, when necessary, in order to keep them clean.\r\nTurpentine, given in a milk emulsion, is a common remedy for intestinal\r\nworms in hogs. The dose is one teaspoonful for every eighty pounds weight.\r\nThis dose should be repeated daily for three days. The following vermifuge\r\ncan be recommended: Santonin three to five grains, calomel five to eight\r\ngrains. This is sufficient for one hundred pounds weight. If the pigs are\r\nsmall and it requires two or three to weigh one hundred pounds, the large\r\ndose should be given. If the hogs weigh one hundred pounds or more, they\r\nshould receive the small dose. The drove should be divided into lots of ten\r\nor fifteen hogs each. The drugs should be mixed and divided into the same\r\nnumber of powders as there are lots of hogs. Ground feed is placed in the\r\ntrough, dampened with milk, or water and the powder sprinkled evenly over\r\nit. The hogs are then allowed to eat the feed. It is best to dose them in\r\nthe morning after they have been off feed for ten or twelve hours.\r\n\r\nVERMINOUS BRONCHITIS IN CALVES.--The lung worms of cattle, _Strongylus\r\nmicrurus_ and _Strongylus pulmonaris_, may cause heavy losses in calves and\r\nyearlings. Older cattle may harbor these parasites, but they do not seem to\r\nbe inconvenienced by them. The _S. micrurus_ is from 1 to 3 inches (25 to\r\n75 mm.) long. The _S. pulmonaris_ is smaller. It is from 0.4 to 1.3 inches\r\n(10 to 35 mm.) long. They are found in the trachea and small bronchial\r\ntubes, where they are mixed with mucous secretions from the inflamed lining\r\nmembrane of the bronchial tubes.\r\n\r\nWet seasons and low, wet pastures are said to favor the development of lung\r\nworms. Their life history is not fully understood. They do not persist\r\ngeneration after generation in the air passages of an animal, but the eggs\r\nand embryos are expelled and live for a time outside of the animal, when\r\nthey may again become parasites of another or the same host.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are the same as occur in bronchitis and pneumonia. Calves\r\nand yearlings are the only animals in the herd that may show symptoms of\r\nthe disease. The air passages become irritated and inflamed, and the calf\r\nshows a slight cough. As the inflammation increases and the worms and\r\nmucous secretions plug up the small bronchial tubes, the coughing spells\r\nbecome more severe and rattling, wheezing sounds may be heard on\r\nauscultating the lungs. The calf finally loses its appetite, becomes\r\nemaciated and weak, and wanders off alone. It is usually found lying down\r\nand shows labored breathing that is occasionally interrupted by paroxysmal\r\ncoughing. The death rate in poorly-cared-for herds is heavy.\r\n\r\nVERMINOUS BRONCHITIS AND PNEUMONIA OF SHEEP.--The two lung worms of sheep\r\nare the _Strongylus filaria_ and Strongylus_ rufescens_. The former is from\r\n1.3 to 3 inches (33 to 80 mm.) long, and the latter from 0.6 to 1 inch (16\r\nto 25 mm.) long. The _S. filaria_ is thread-like and the _S. refuscens_\r\nhair-like in appearance. For this reason they are termed thread and hair\r\nlung-worms. The thread-worm is found in the trachea and the larger\r\nbronchial tubes, and the hair-worm in the most minute as well as the larger\r\nbronchioli.\r\n\r\nThis disease is most common in wet seasons. Undrained pastures and ponds\r\nare said to favor the spread of the disease. Permanent pastures favor the\r\nreinfection of the flock from year to year. The eggs and embryos are\r\nexpelled in coughing, and live for a time in the pastures, pens and houses.\r\nThe sheep become infected through the dust, drinking water or feed.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms of verminous bronchitis_ and pneumonia are quite\r\ncharacteristic. Lambs suffer most from these diseases. A number of animals\r\nin the flock are affected. Coughing, rapid and labored breathing, loss of\r\nappetite, emaciation and weakness are the usual symptoms noticed. When a\r\nparoxysm of coughing occurs, considerable mucus is expelled. An examination\r\nof the expectorations may result in finding a few lung worms. In\r\npoorly-cared-for flocks, and when complicated by stomach and intestinal\r\nworms, the death rate is usually heavy.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ of lung-worm diseases in lambs and calves is largely\r\npreventive. We should use every possible precaution against introducing the\r\ninfection into the herd or flock. It is not advisable to bring animals from\r\nan infected herd onto the premises, without subjecting them to a careful\r\nexamination and a long quarantine before allowing them to stable or pasture\r\nwith the other animals. Calves or lambs that show marked symptoms of\r\ndisease should be given comfortable quarters, and special care and feeding.\r\nThe entire herd or flock must be given the best care and ration possible.\r\nThis is the only satisfactory method of treatment. Changing the pasture or\r\nlot frequently may help in ridding the premises of the infection.\r\n\r\nVERMINOUS BRONCHITIS IN HOGS.--The lung worm, _Strongylus paradoxus_, is a\r\ncommon parasite of young hogs. It is from 0.6 to 1.6 inches (16 to 40 mm.)\r\nlong. When the infection is light, the worms are found mostly in the\r\nbronchial tubes of the margin and apex of the lung.\r\n\r\nInfection with this parasite does not depend on the humidity of the soil,\r\nor low, wet pastures containing ponds. Probably dusty quarters are\r\nresponsible in large degree for this disease.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms are most evident_ in pigs weighing from forty to eighty\r\npounds. The first symptom is a cough, occurring on leaving the bed, after\r\nexercise and after eating. In badly infected cases the paroxysm of coughing\r\nis quite severe. The appetite usually remains good and the thriftiness of\r\nthe pig is not seriously interfered with. The feeding of a suitable ration,\r\nand the good care that is usually given young hogs, are responsible for the\r\nmildness of the disease.\r\n\r\nThe treatment that is of most importance is clean quarters, and the feeding\r\nof a ration that will keep the pig growing and healthy. The sleeping\r\nquarters should be kept free from dust. Disinfectants should be used freely\r\nabout the quarters.\r\n\r\nTHE KIDNEY WORM OF HOGS.--_Sclerostoma pinguicola_ is the kidney worm of\r\nhogs. It is from 1 to 1.5 inches (25 to 27 mm.) long, and when seen against\r\nthe kidney fat it appears dark or mottled. It is usually found in the fat\r\nin the region of the pelvis of the kidney. Although the kidney worm is\r\ncapable of causing inflammatory changes in the tissues surrounding the\r\nkidney and the pelvis of this organ, the disease cannot be determined by\r\nany noticeable symptom. Paralysis of the posterior portion of the body is\r\nattributed to the presence of kidney worms by stockmen. There are no data\r\nby which we may prove that the kidney worm is responsible for this\r\ndisorder.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is preventive. Clean feed, pens, watering troughs and\r\nfeeding floors are the preventive measures indicated here. It is useless to\r\nattempt treatment with drugs, as the worms are out of reach of any drug\r\nthat may be administered.\r\n\r\nWORMS OF THE DIGESTIVE TRACT OF POULTRY.--Poultry are often seriously\r\ninfested with worms. A small number of the less injurious worms may not\r\ncause any appreciable symptoms of disease; but the fowl that harbors them\r\nis a source of infection to the other fowls. The infectious nature of\r\nparasitic disease caused by worms should be recognized more fully than at\r\npresent by poultrymen.\r\n\r\nThe different species of poultry are hosts for many different species of\r\nround-worms, thorn-headed worms and tapeworms. Dr. Kaupp states that\r\n_Acaris inflexa_ or large round-worm, _Heterakis pipilosa_ or small\r\nround-worm, and the _Spiroptera hamulosa_ or gizzard-worm are frequently\r\nfound in fowls. The common round-worm may be found in the first portion of\r\nthe intestine, and the small round-worm in the caecum. Neither of the\r\nspecies are dangerous unless present in large numbers. They may then\r\nobstruct the intestine, and irritate the intestinal mucous membrane. This\r\nmay cause constipation, catarrhal inflammation of the intestine and\r\ndiarrhoea. The gizzard-worm is the most dangerous of the parasites\r\nmentioned. The gizzard has an important digestive function, and any\r\ncondition that may weaken its muscular walls may cause serious digestive\r\ndisorders. This parasite may encyst in the wall of the gizzard.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ of intestinal worms in poultry is both preventive and\r\ncurative. The preventive measures consist in keeping the houses and runs\r\nclean. Air-slaked lime should be scattered over the runs every few weeks.\r\nThe drinking places should be cleaned and disinfected daily. All possible\r\nprecautions should be taken in order to prevent filth from getting into the\r\ndrinking water. Epsom salts, powdered areca nut and santonin are the\r\nremedies commonly recommended for the treatment of intestinal worms. From\r\ntwenty to forty grains of Epsom salts may be given. Powdered areca nut is\r\nrecommended in from three to ten grain doses. Santonin may be given in from\r\none to two grain doses. Both the areca nut and santonin may be given with\r\nthe feed.\r\n\r\nTHE GAPES IN BIRDS.--The gape-worm, _Syngamus trachealis_, is from 0.2 to\r\n0.8 inch (5 to 20 mm.) long. The male and female are permanently united.\r\nThe male is about one-third as long as the female, and when attached to the\r\nanterior third of the female, gives the pair a forked appearance.\r\n\r\nFowls become infested with the gape-worm by eating the adult parasite that\r\nhas been expectorated, or an earth worm that is host for the immature\r\nparasite. The embryo gape-worm is freed in the intestine, and from here\r\nthey are supposed to migrate into the abdominal air sacs and to the trachea\r\nand bronchi.\r\n\r\n_The symptom_ are most severe in very young fowls. The affected bird opens\r\nits mouth and appears to gasp for breath, sneeze and attempt to swallow. In\r\nthe severe cases the appetite is interfered with, mucus accumulates in the\r\nmouth and the bird is dull and listless. The death rate is quite high in\r\nyoung-chickens and turkeys.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is both preventive and curative. If the gape-worm is known\r\nto be present in the runs, the ground should be covered with lime, and the\r\nfowls moved to fresh runs if possible. The young birds should not be\r\nexposed to the infection until they are well feathered out. Antiseptics may\r\nbe given with the drinking water. Disinfectants should be used freely about\r\nthe poultry houses, and the quarters kept clean. The worms may be snared by\r\ninserting a stiff horse hair that has been twisted and forms a loop into\r\nthe trachea. This may be dipped into camphorated oil or turpentine. This\r\ntreatment should be repeated until the bird has been relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Name the different groups of internal parasites; give examples of each.\r\n\r\n2.

It is characterized by\r\nan inflammation, of the lymphatic glands, kidneys, intestines, lungs and\r\nskin. The inflammation is hemorrhagic in character, the inflamed organs\r\nusually showing deep red spots or blotches.\r\n\r\nHog-cholera is especially prevalent in the corn-raising States which\r\npossess a denser hog population than any other section of the United\r\nStates. In this country the loss from hog-cholera in 1913 amounted to more\r\nthan $60,000,000, and it may be considered of greater economic importance\r\nthan any of the other animal diseases.\r\n\r\nSPECIFIC CAUSE.--The specific cause of hog-cholera is an _ultra-visible\r\norganism_ that is present in the excretions, secretions and tissues of a\r\ncholera hog. De Schweinitz and Dorset in 1903 produced typical hog-cholera\r\nby inoculating hogs with cholera-blood filtrates that were free from any\r\norganism that could be demonstrated by microscopical examination or any\r\ncultural method. The term ultra-visible virus is applied to the virus of\r\nhog-cholera.\r\n\r\n_The ultra-visible virus_ is eliminated from the body of the cholera hog\r\nwith the body secretions and excretions. Healthy hogs contract the disease\r\nby eating feed or drinking water that is infected with the virus. There are\r\nother methods of infection, but field and experimental data show that\r\nhog-cholera is commonly produced by taking the germs into the body with\r\nfood and drinking water.\r\n\r\nACCESSORY CAUSES.--The usual method of introducing hog-cholera into a\r\nneighborhood is through the importation of feeding or breeding hogs that\r\nwere infected with the disease before they were purchased, or became\r\ninfected through exposure to the disease in the public stock-yards and\r\nstock-cars. The shipping of feeding hogs from one section of the country to\r\nanother, and from public stock-yards, has always been productive of\r\nhog-cholera. Dr. Dorset states that more than fifty-seven per cent of the\r\nhog-cholera outbreaks are caused by visiting, exchanging work, exposure on\r\nadjoining farms and harboring the infection from year to year (Fig. 79),\r\nand more than twenty-three per cent to purchasing hogs and shipping in\r\ninfected cars, birds and contaminated streams.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--A hog yard where the disease-producing germs may\r\nbe carried over from year to year.]\r\n\r\nIn neighborhoods where outbreaks of hog-cholera occur necessary precautions\r\nagainst the spread of the disease are not taken. The _exchange of help_ at\r\nthreshing and shredding time in neighborhoods where there is an outbreak of\r\nhog-cholera is the most common method of spreading the disease. _Visiting\r\nfarms_ where hogs are dying of cholera; walking or driving a team and wagon\r\nthrough the cholera-infected yards; stock buyers, stock-food and\r\ncholera-remedy venders that visit the different farms in a neighborhood may\r\ndistribute the hog-cholera virus through the infected filth that may adhere\r\nto the shoes, horses' feet and wagon wheels. _Cholera hogs_ may carry the\r\ndisease directly to a healthy herd when allowed to run at large. _Streams_\r\nthat are polluted with the drainage from cholera-infected yards are common\r\nsources of disease.\r\n\r\n_Pigeons, dogs, cows_ and _buzzards_ that travel about the neighborhood and\r\nfeed in hog yards and on the carcasses of cholera hogs may distribute the\r\ndisease. Because of the active part that dogs, birds and surface drainage\r\ntake in the distribution of hog-cholera, the practice of allowing the\r\ncarcasses of dead hogs to lie on the ground and decompose is responsible\r\nfor a large percentage of the hog-cholera outbreaks.\r\n\r\n_Age_ is an important predisposing factor. Young hogs are most susceptible\r\nto cholera, and this susceptibility can be greatly increased by giving them\r\ncrowded, filthy quarters. Infection with lice, lung and intestinal worms,\r\nthe feeding of an improper ration and sudden changes in the ration lower\r\nthe natural resistance of a hog against disease. Pampered hogs usually\r\ndevelop acute cholera when exposed to this disease.\r\n\r\nHog-cholera is more virulent or acute during the summer and fall months\r\nthan it is during the winter and spring months. After the disease sweeps\r\nover a section of country, it becomes less virulent and takes on a subacute\r\nor chronic form. Outbreaks of hog-cholera usually last two or three years\r\nin a neighborhood. This depends largely on the number of susceptible hogs\r\nthat were not exposed to the infection the first season, and the preventive\r\nprecautions observed by the owners.\r\n\r\nPERIOD OF INCUBATION.--The length of time elapsing between the exposure of\r\nthe hog to the cholera virus, and the development of noticeable symptoms of\r\nhog-cholera, varies from a few days to two or three weeks. The length of\r\nthis incubation period depends on the susceptibility of the animal, the\r\nvirulence of the virus and the method of exposure. An acute form of\r\nhog-cholera indicates a short period of incubation, and a chronic form, a\r\nlong period.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--The symptoms of hog-cholera may differ widely in the different\r\noutbreaks of the disease. The symptoms may be classified under the\r\nfollowing forms: Acute, subacute and chronic. The acute form of hog-cholera\r\nis the most common. The early symptoms are tremors, fever, depressed\r\nappearance, marked weakness, staggering gait, constipation and diarrhoea,\r\nlabored breathing and convulsions. Death may occur within a few hours or a\r\nfew days. Recovery seldom occurs. In the subacute form, the symptoms are\r\nmild and develop slowly. Recovery may take place within a few days, or\r\nafter extending over a week or ten days it may assume the chronic form.\r\nVery often in outbreaks of subacute cholera a large majority of the herd\r\ndoes not show visible symptoms of the disease. In the chronic form, marked\r\nsymptoms of pleuropneumonia and chronic inflammation of the intestine are\r\ncommon. Ulcers and sores form on the skin and the hair may come off. Large\r\nportions of the skin may become gangrenous and slough. Young hogs are\r\nusually stunted and emaciated.\r\n\r\n_The first symptom_ of disease is an elevation of body temperature.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of any outbreak of hog-cholera the _body temperatures_ of\r\nthe apparently healthy animals may vary from 105\\260 to 108\\260 F. After\r\na few days, animals that are fatally sick or recovering from the disease\r\nmay show normal or subnormal body temperature.\r\n\r\n_Loss of appetite_ is the first symptom of disease usually noted by the\r\nperson in charge of the herd. The hog may show a disposition to eat dirt.\r\nThe sick hog is usually found lying in its bed, or off by itself in a quiet\r\nplace. It presents a rather _characteristic appearance_. The back is\r\narched, the hind feet are held close together, or crossed, the abdomen is\r\ntucked up and the hog appears weak in its hind parts. _Diarrhoea_ or\r\n_constipation_ may be present. The color of the diarrhoeal discharges\r\nvaries according to the character of the feed, and it may be more or less\r\ntinged with blood and have a disagreeable odor. The urine is highly\r\ncolored.\r\n\r\n_The respirations and pulse beats_ are quickened and abnormal in character.\r\nThumps sometimes occur. When the mucous membranes lining the throat and\r\nanterior air passages are thickened, the respirations are noisy and\r\ndifficult. The animal may cough on getting up from its bed and moving\r\nabout. There is at times a noticeable discharge from the nostrils. When the\r\n_lungs_ are inflamed the respirations are quickened and labored. In case\r\nthe pleural membrane is inflamed, the respiratory symptoms are more severe,\r\nand the hog shows evidence of pain when the walls of the chest are pressed\r\non. The _pericardium_ may be inflamed. In such cases the hog staggers and\r\nfalls when forced to walk.\r\n\r\n_The central nervous system_ may be involved by the inflammation. The usual\r\nsymptoms occurring in inflammation of the brain and its coverings are then\r\npresent. A sleepy, comatose condition may end in death, or the animal dies\r\nin a convulsion.\r\n\r\n_The secretions of the skin_ and mucous membranes are abnormal. The skin in\r\nthe regions of the ears, inside of the thighs and under surface of the body\r\nis moist, dirty or discolored red. Just before death the skin over the\r\nunder surface of the body becomes a purplish red. In the chronic form, a\r\ndirty, thickened, wrinkled skin is commonly observed. At first the\r\nsecretion from the eyes is thin and watery, but it becomes thick, heavy and\r\npus-like, causing the margins of the lids to adhere to each other.\r\n\r\nThe death rate in hog-cholera varies in the different forms of the disease.\r\nThe average death rate is about fifty per cent.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS.--The diagnosis of hog-cholera in the field must\r\ndepend on the clinical symptoms, post-mortem lesions and history of the\r\noutbreak. The history should be that of a highly infectious disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Carcass of a cholera hog showing different groups\r\nof lymphatic glands; kidneys; and ulcer on caecum.]\r\n\r\n_Abnormal body temperatures_ of a large percentage of the herd indicate the\r\npresence of an acute infectious disease. We should then destroy one of the\r\nsick hogs and make a careful post-mortem examination (Fig. 80). An early\r\ndiagnosis of the disease is necessary, as this enables us to use curative\r\ntreatment when it will do some good, and take the necessary steps toward\r\npreventing the spread of the disease to neighboring herds.\r\n\r\n_Intestinal and lung worms_ are common in young hogs. The presence of these\r\nworms does not always indicate that they are the cause of the sickness and\r\ndeath of the animal. Such parasites are injurious and may cause disease,\r\nbut it is only in rare cases that they cause death.\r\n\r\n\"_Pig typhoid_\" is sometimes spoken of as a highly infectious disease\r\ninvolving the intestines. A disease of hogs that may be termed typhus-fever\r\nsometimes affects a large number of the hogs in the herd. This disease\r\noccurs among hogs kept in small yards and houses that are crowded,\r\nunsanitary and in continuous use, or when the hogs drink from wallows,\r\nponds and creeks.\r\n\r\nThe term swine-plague should not be used in speaking of outbreaks of\r\nhog-cholera, as it is now considered a form of hog-cholera involving\r\nespecially the lungs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Kidneys from hog that died of acute hog-cholera.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Lungs from hog that died of acute hog-cholera.]\r\n\r\nLESIONS.--In _acute hog-cholera_ the inflammation is hemorrhagic in\r\ncharacter. Small, red spots and blotches occur in different organs and\r\ntissues. In the _chronic form_ of the disease ulceration of the intestinal\r\nand gastric mucous membrane, inflammation of the lungs and pleura and\r\nsloughing of the skin are common lesions.\r\n\r\n_The skin_ over the under side of the neck, body and inside of the thighs\r\nmay appear red or purplish-red in color. The different groups of _lymphatic\r\nglands_ are enlarged and softened. They may vary in color from a\r\ngrayish-red to a deep red, depending on the degree of engorgement with\r\nblood. The pleura and pericardium may show small red spots and blotches.\r\nThe _kidneys_ are usually lighter colored than normal, and marked with red\r\nspots and blotches (Fig. 81). The _spleen_ may show no evidence of disease.\r\nIt may be large and soft, or even smaller than normal. The _liver_ may be\r\nenlarged and dark, or mottled and light colored.\r\n\r\nThe _stomach_ and _intestines_ may show hemorrhagic spots and blotches.\r\nSometimes the gastric and intestinal mucous membrane is a brick red.\r\nUlceration of the mucous membrane is common (Fig. 83).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--A piece of intestine from a hog that died of\r\nchronic hog-cholera, showing appearance of intestinal ulcers.]\r\n\r\nSmall, red spots may be present on the surface of the _lungs_ (Fig. 82).\r\nScattered lung lobules or a large portion of the lungs may be inflamed. In\r\nchronic hog-cholera, pleural exudation, adhesions and abscesses in the lung\r\ntissue may occur. Inflammations of the pericardium and heart muscle are\r\nless common lesions.\r\n\r\nPREVENTIVE MEASURES.--Hog-cholera is the most widespread infectious disease\r\nof hogs, and all possible precautions against its distribution to healthy\r\nherds should be practised. Hogs coming from other herds and stock shows\r\nshould be excluded from the home herd until they are positively shown to be\r\nfree from disease. They should be quarantined in yards set off for this\r\npurpose. The hogs should be cleaned by dipping or washing them with a\r\ndisinfectant. The quarantine period should be longer than the average\r\nperiod of incubation. Three weeks is sufficient.\r\n\r\n_The possible introduction of the disease_ into the pens by people, dogs,\r\nbirds and other carriers of the disease should be guarded against,\r\nespecially if cholera is present in the neighborhood. The exchange of help\r\nat threshing and shredding time with a neighbor who has hog-cholera on his\r\nfarm is a common method of distributing the infection. It is not advisable\r\nto allow a stranger to enter your hog-houses and yards, unless his shoes\r\nare first disinfected. Whenever it is necessary for a person to enter yards\r\nwhere the disease is present, the shoes should be cleaned and disinfected\r\non leaving. The wheels of wagons, and the feet of horses that are driven\r\nthrough cholera yards, should be washed with a disinfectant. The feet of\r\nfeeding cattle that are shipped from stock-yards should be treated in the\r\nsame manner. Persons taking care of cholera hogs should observe the\r\nnecessary precautions against the distribution of the disease, and see that\r\nothers practise like precautions.\r\n\r\nHog-yards should be well drained and all wallow holes filled. Pens and\r\npastures through which the drainage from the swine enclosures higher up\r\nflows should not be used for hogs.\r\n\r\nCARE OF A DISEASED HERD.--When an outbreak of hog-cholera occurs on a farm\r\nthe farm should be quarantined. The herd should be moved away from running\r\nstreams, public roads and line fences, so that neighboring herds are not\r\nunnecessarily exposed to the disease. During the hot weather shade and an\r\nopportunity to range over a grass lot or pasture are highly necessary. A\r\nrecently mowed meadow, or a blue grass pasture and a low shed, open on all\r\nsides and amply large for the herd to lie under, give the animals clean\r\nrange and comfortable, cool quarters. Roomy, dry, well-ventilated\r\nsleeping-quarters that are free from drafts and can be cleaned and\r\ndisinfected are best when the weather is cold and wet.\r\n\r\nIn the subacute, and in the early part of an acute outbreak of hog-cholera,\r\nit is advisable to separate the sick from the well hogs. The fatally sick\r\nanimals should be destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Cleaning up a hog lot.]\r\n\r\nA very light ration should be fed and an intestinal antiseptic given with\r\nthe feed. A thin slop of shorts is usually preferred. Four ounces of\r\npulverized copper sulfate may be dissolved in one gallon of hot water, and\r\none quart of this solution may be added to every ten gallons of drinking\r\nwater and slop. Water and slop should not be left in the troughs for the\r\nhogs to wallow in. The troughs should be disinfected and turned bottom side\r\nup as soon as the hogs have finished feeding and drinking. Kitchen slop and\r\nsour milk should not be fed. The care and treatment of the herd require\r\nwork and close attention on the part of the attendant. Indifferent,\r\ncareless treatment is of no use in this disease.\r\n\r\nA disinfectant should be sprayed or sprinkled about the feed troughs,\r\nfloors, pens and sleeping quarters daily.\r\n\r\nDISPOSING OF DEAD HOGS.--The carcasses of the dead hogs should be burned.\r\nBefore placing the carcass on the fire, it should be cut open and several\r\nlong incisions made through the skin. A crematory may be made by digging\r\ntwo cross trenches that are about one foot deep at the point where they\r\ncross, and shallow at the ends. Iron bars or pipe may be laid over the\r\ntrenches where they cross for the carcass to rest upon, or woven wire\r\nfencing securely fastened with stakes may be used in the place of the iron\r\nbars. If the carcass is disposed of by burying, it should be buried at\r\nleast four feet deep and covered with quicklime.\r\n\r\nDISINFECTING THE YARDS AND HOUSES.--If the sick hogs are moved to new\r\nquarters at the beginning of the outbreak, the hog houses and yards should\r\nbe cleaned and disinfected (Fig. 84). The manure and all other litter\r\nshould be hauled away to a field where there is no danger from this\r\ninfectious material becoming scattered about the premises, leaving a centre\r\nof infection in the neighborhood and causing outbreaks of cholera among\r\nneighboring herds. It may be advisable to burn the corn-cobs and other\r\nlitter that have accumulated about the yards. Loose board floors should be\r\ntorn up and the manure from beneath removed. Portable houses should be\r\nremoved. The floors, walls of the house and fences should be first cleaned\r\nby scraping off the filth, and then sprayed with a three per cent water\r\nsolution of a cresol or coal tar disinfectant to which sufficient lime has\r\nbeen added to make a thin whitewash. Three or four months of warm, sunny\r\nweather are sufficient to destroy the cholera infection in well-cleaned\r\nyards.\r\n\r\nANTI-HOG-CHOLERA SERUM.--The credit of developing the first and at present\r\nthe only reliable anti-hog-cholera serum and method of vaccination belongs\r\nto Drs. Dorset and Niles. Anti-hog-cholera serum came into general use in\r\n1908, and all of the swine-producing States have established State\r\nlaboratories for the production of this serum.\r\n\r\nAnti-hog-cholera serum is produced by injecting directly, or indirectly,\r\ninto the blood-vessels of an immune hog a large quantity of cholera virus,\r\nsecured by bleeding a hog that is fatally sick with acute cholera, and\r\nbleeding the injected animal after it has completely recovered from the\r\ninjection. The injection of the cholera blood is for the purpose of\r\nstimulating the production of antibodies by the body tissues, and raising\r\nthe protective properties of the immune hog's blood. An animal so treated\r\nis called a hyperimmune (Fig. 85). The blood from the hyperimmunes is\r\ndefibrinated and a preservative added, and after it has been tested for\r\npotency and freedom from contaminating organisms, it is ready for use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Hyperimmune hogs used for the production of\r\nanti-hog-cholera serum.]\r\n\r\nTHE VACCINATION OF HOGS WITH ANTI-HOG-CHOLERA SERUM.--The vaccination of a\r\nhog by the single method consists in injecting hypodermically or\r\nintramuscularly anti-hog-cholera serum. The immunity conferred may not last\r\nlonger than three or four weeks.\r\n\r\nThe vaccination of a hog by the _double method_ consists in injecting\r\nhypodermically or intramuscularly anti-hog-cholera serum and hog-cholera\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n_The vaccination or treatment_ of a cholera hog showing noticeable\r\nsymptoms, or a high body temperature, consists in injecting hypodermically\r\nor intramuscularly anti-hog-cholera serum (Fig. 87).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Preparing the hog for vaccination by washing the\r\npart where the serum is injected with a disinfectant.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Vaccinating a hog.]\r\n\r\n_The region_ into which the serum and cholera blood may be injected are the\r\ninside of the thigh, within the arm, flank and side of the neck (Fig. 86).\r\nTwo hypodermic syringes, holding about twenty cubic centimetres and six\r\ncubic centimetres, and having short, heavy, seventeen or eighteen-gauge\r\nslip-on needles, should be used. The small syringe is used for injecting\r\nthe virulent or cholera blood which is injected into a different part than\r\nthe serum. The quantity of serum and virus injected varies with the size\r\nand condition of the animal. _Young hogs_ should receive one-half cubic\r\ncentimetre of serum for each pound of body weight, and _cholera hogs_\r\nshould be given one-half more to twice the dose that is recommended for\r\nhealthy animals. The dose of virus recommended varies from one to two cubic\r\ncentimetres for each hog.\r\n\r\nIn vaccinating _small pigs_ not more than five, and in large hogs not more\r\nthan twenty, cubic centimetres should be injected at any one point. The\r\n_body temperature_ of each animal should be taken. A body temperature of\r\n103.5\\260 F. in a mature hog and a body temperature of 104\\260 F. in a\r\nyoung hog may indicate hog-cholera. Exercise, feeding and close\r\nconfinement in a warm place may raise the body temperature above the\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nHogs that are to be vaccinated or treated should not be given feed for at\r\nleast twelve hours before handling them. If possible they should be\r\nconfined in a roomy, clean, well-bedded pen. If this is practised, they are\r\ncleaner and easier to handle and their body temperatures are less apt to\r\nvary. After the treatment or vaccination the hogs should be fed a light\r\ndiet for a period of at least ten days, and the ration increased gradually\r\nin order to avoid causing acute indigestion. This is necessary because of\r\nthe elevation in body temperature resulting from the inability of the\r\nanimal to digest heavy feeds, kitchen slops and sour milk. If poor judgment\r\nis used in caring for the vaccinated hogs, and the person who vaccinates\r\nthem uses careless methods, heavy losses from acute indigestion, blood\r\npoisoning, or hog-cholera may occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

Its contagious character was proven by Villemin in 1865,\r\nwho by experential infection transmitted tuberculosis from man to animals\r\nand from animal to animal. It was in 1882 that Dr. Robert Koch discovered\r\nand proved by inoculation experiments that the disease was caused by a\r\nspecific germ (Fig. 88). Prior to the experiments by Villemin and Koch, the\r\nbelief was that tuberculosis was due to heredity, unsanitary conditions and\r\ninbreeding. Following discovery of the specific germ and conditions\r\nfavoring its development and spread, numerous scientifically conducted\r\nexperiments were made. These resulted in practical methods of control and\r\nelimination of tuberculosis from herds having this disease. By carefully\r\nconducted experiments and other forms of educational work the infectious\r\ncharacter of tuberculosis and the economic importance of preventative\r\nmeasures have been demonstrated. The average stockman is well informed\r\nregarding the character and economic importance of this disease, but there\r\nis no general application of this knowledge, and tuberculosis is increasing\r\nin dairy and breeding herds. The slow development of tuberculosis, and the\r\nabsence of visible symptoms during the early stage of the disease, are\r\nresponsible for this condition and the extensive infection of dairy and\r\nbreeding herds.\r\n\r\nPREVALENCE OF THE DISEASE.--Tuberculosis is very prevalent among cattle and\r\nswine in all countries where intensive agriculture is practised. It is a\r\nrare disease among cattle of the steppes of eastern Europe and the cattle\r\nranges of the western portion of the United States. In countries where\r\ndairying is an important industry, tuberculosis is a common disease of\r\ncattle and hogs. The abattoir reports of Europe and the United States show\r\nthat tuberculosis is on the increase among domestic animals. The Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture reports that\r\nout of 400,008 cattle tested with tuberculin 9.25 per cent reacted. Melvin\r\nstates that the annual loss from tuberculosis in the United States is about\r\n$23,000,000. In dairy herds in which the disease has existed for several\r\nyears, it is not uncommon to find from 25 to 75 per cent tubercular.\r\n\r\nTHE DIRECT CAUSE.--The direct cause of tuberculosis is Koch's _Bacillus\r\ntuberculosis_. This is a slender, rod-shaped microorganisms (Fig. 88)\r\noccurring in the diseased tissues, feces and milk of a tubercular animal.\r\nIt belongs to that small group known as acid-fast bacteria. The tubercle\r\nbacillus is not really destroyed by external influences, and it may retain\r\nits virulence for several months in dried sputum if protected from the\r\nlight. Its vitality enables it to resist high temperatures, changes in\r\ntemperature, drying and putrefaction to a, greater degree than most\r\nnon-spore-producing germs. Direct sunlight destroys the germ within a few\r\nhours, but it may live in poorly lighted, filthy stables for months. A\r\ntemperature of 65\\260 C. destroys it in a few minutes.\r\n\r\nAnimals that, have advanced or open tuberculosis may disseminate the germ\r\nof the disease in the discharge from the mouth, nostrils, genital organs,\r\nin the intestinal excreta and milk. The germs discharged from the mouth and\r\nnostrils are coughed up from the lungs and may infect the feed. Milk is a\r\ncommon source of infection for calves and hogs. Allowing hogs to run after\r\ncattle is sure to result in infection of a large percentage of them, if\r\nthere are any open cases of tuberculosis in the herd.\r\n\r\nPREDISPOSING CAUSES.--Any condition that may lessen the resistance of the\r\nbody or enable the tubercle bacillus to survive the exposure outside the\r\nbody favors the development of the disease and the infection of the healthy\r\nanimals. Crowded, poorly ventilated, filthy stables lower the\r\ndisease-resisting power of the animal, and favor the entrance of the germs\r\ninto the body. Under such unsanitary conditions, tuberculosis spreads\r\nquickly among dairy cattle, and a large percentage of the animals develop\r\nthe generalized form of the disease. Sanitary stables and yards do not\r\nprevent the spread of the disease among animals that live in close contact\r\nwith one another. Fresh air and sanitary surroundings only check the spread\r\nand retard its progress.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION OF TUBERCULOSIS INTO THE HERD.--The common method of\r\nintroducing tuberculosis into the herd is through the purchase of animals\r\nhaving the disease. Such animals may be in apparent good health at the time\r\nof purchase, and be affected with generalized or open tuberculosis.\r\n\r\n_A source of infection_ is by unknowingly buying cows that have reacted to\r\nthe tuberculin test. The indiscriminate use and sale of tuberculin are\r\nlargely responsible for the large number of reacting animals that have been\r\nplaced on the open market. This dishonest practice has resulted in the\r\nrapid spread of the disease in certain localities. For years a large\r\npercentage of the breeding herds have been infected, and the writer has met\r\nwith several herds of dairy and beef cattle that became tubercular through\r\nthe purchase of tubercular breeding animals.\r\n\r\nSYMPTOMS.--There is no one symptom by which we may recognize tuberculosis\r\nin cattle and hogs. None of the symptoms shown by a tubercular animal are\r\ncharacteristic, unless it is in the late stage of the disease. In a\r\nwell-cared-for animal, the lymphatic glands in the different regions of the\r\nbody, the lungs, liver and other organs, may be full of tubercles without\r\ncausing noticeable symptoms of disease (Fig. 89).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--A tubercular cow. This cow was, to all\r\nappearances, in good health, but showed generalized tuberculosis on\r\npost-mortem examination.]\r\n\r\n_Tuberculosis may attack any organ of the body_, and in the different cases\r\nof the disease the symptoms may vary. Enlargement of the glands in the\r\nregion of the throat, and noisy, difficult breathing are sometimes present.\r\nThe udder frequently shows hard lumps scattered through the gland. Bloating\r\nmay occur if a diseased gland in the chest cavity presses on the oesophagus\r\nand prevents the usual passage of gas from the paunch. Chronic diarrhoea\r\nmay occur. If the disease involves the digestive tract, the animal is\r\nunthrifty and loses flesh rapidly. Coughing is not a characteristic\r\nsymptom, and we should not place too much emphasis on it. If the lungs\r\nbecome tubercular the animal usually has a slight, harsh cough. The cough\r\nis first noticed when the cattle get up after lying down, when the stable\r\nis first opened in the morning and when the animals are driven. If the\r\nchest walls are thin, soreness from pressure on the ribs may be noted. By\r\napplying the ear to the chest wall and listening to the lung sounds,\r\nabsence of respiratory murmurs and abnormal sounds may be distinguished,\r\ndue to consolidation of the lung tissue, abscess cavities and pleural\r\nadhesions. In a well-advanced case the hair is rough, the skin becomes\r\ntight and the neck thin and lean. The animal may breathe through the mouth\r\nwhen it is exercised. Weakness may be a prominent symptom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Tubercular spleens.]\r\n\r\nBreeding animals that are well fed and cared for may live for several years\r\nbefore showing noticeable symptoms of tuberculosis. The disease progresses\r\nmore rapidly in milch cows, especially if given poor care. Calves allowed\r\nto nurse a tubercular mother that is giving off tubercle bacilli frequently\r\ndevelop enlarged throat glands and the intestinal form of the disease.\r\n\r\nHogs develop a generalized form of tuberculosis more quickly than cattle,\r\nbut an unthrifty, emaciated condition is seldom noted in hogs under ten\r\nmonths old.\r\n\r\nPOST-MORTEM LESIONS.--The effect of the tubercle bacillus on the body is to\r\nirritate and destroy the tissues. Lumps or tubercles form in the lymphatic\r\nglands, liver, lungs, spleen (Fig. 90), serous membranes, kidneys and other\r\nbody organs (Figs. 91 and 92). The tubercles may be very small at first,\r\nbut as the disease progresses they continue to enlarge until finally a\r\ntubercular mass the size of a base-ball, or larger, is formed (Figs. 93,\r\n94, 95 and 96). Lymphatic glands may become several times larger than\r\nnormal and the liver and lungs greatly enlarged. The pleura and peritoneum\r\nmay be thickened and covered with tubercles about the size of a millet\r\nseed, or larger. Pleural and peritoneal adhesions to the organs within the\r\nbody cavities are common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--The carcass of a tubercular cow. Note the\r\ncondition of the carcass, and the tubercular nodules on the chest wall,\r\nshowing that the disease was well advanced.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--A section of the chest wall of a tubercular cow\r\nshowing a better view of the diseased tissue.]\r\n\r\nThe tubercle usually undergoes a cheesy degeneration. Old tubercles may\r\nbecome hard and calcareous. Sometimes the capsule of the tubercle is filled\r\nwith pus. A yellowish, cheesy material within the capsule of the tubercular\r\nnodule or mass is typical of the disease.\r\n\r\nTHE TUBERCULIN TEST.--The only certain method of recognizing tuberculosis\r\nis by this test. There is no other method of recognizing this disease that\r\nis more accurate than the above test.\r\n\r\nThe substance used in testing animals for tuberculosis is a laboratory\r\nproduct. It is a germ-free fluid prepared by growing the tubercle bacillus\r\nin culture medium (bouillon) until charged with the toxic products of their\r\ngrowth. The culture medium is then heated to a boiling temperature in order\r\nto destroy the germs. It is then passed through a porcelain filter that\r\nremoves the dead germs. The remaining fluid is tuberculin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--A very large tubercular gland that had broken down\r\nin the central portion.]\r\n\r\n_There are two methods of applying_ the tuberculin test. The subcutaneous\r\ntest consists in injecting a certain quantity of tuberculin beneath the\r\nskin, and keeping a record of the body temperature of the animal between\r\nthe eighth and eighteenth hours following the injection. Tubercular animals\r\nshow an elevation in temperature that comes on about the eighth or twelfth\r\nhour of the test. In the _intradermal test_, a small quantity of a special\r\ntuberculin is injected into the deeper layer of the skin. The seat of the\r\ninjection in cattle is a fold of the skin on the under side of the base of\r\nthe tail. In tubercular animals the injection is followed by a\r\ncharacteristic local swelling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--A tubercular gland that is split open.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Caul showing tuberculosis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Foot of hog showing tuberculosis of joint.]\r\n\r\nThe control of tuberculosis is largely in the hands of the breeder and\r\ndairyman. This is a disease that requires the cooperation of stockmen and\r\nsanitary officers in the application of control measures. If there are\r\nseveral open cases of tuberculosis in a herd of cattle, the application of\r\nthe tuberculin test, removal of the reacting animals and disinfection of\r\nthe premises are not sufficient to eradicate the disease. It is necessary\r\nto repeat the tuberculin test within six months, and later at twelve-months\r\nintervals, until none of the animals that remain in the herd react.\r\n\r\nThe most practical method of disposing of dairy cows that react to the\r\ntuberculin test is to slaughter them. Unless a large percentage of the herd\r\nis tubercular, it is not advisable to practise segregation and quarantine.\r\nThis may be advisable if the reactor is a valuable breeding animal, unless\r\nvisible symptoms are shown. The milk from reacting cows may be used if it\r\nis boiled or sterilized. Whenever a calf is born of a reactor, it should be\r\nseparated from the mother and fed milk from a healthy cow.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the tubercular from the healthy cows must be complete.\r\nSeparate buildings, yards and pastures that do not join the quarters where\r\nthe healthy animals are kept should be provided. The person attending the\r\nreactors should not attend the healthy animals, and separate forks,\r\nshovels, pails and other utensils should be provided for the two herds.\r\n\r\nThe best method of controlling tuberculosis in hogs is to slaughter all\r\nreactors, disinfect yards and houses and move the herd. If the old quarters\r\nare free from filth and carefully disinfected, the hogs may be returned\r\nwithout danger of infection after six months. A retest of the herd should\r\nbe made before returning them to the permanent quarters and the reactors\r\nslaughtered.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

The bacteria\r\nthat cause pyaemia are transferred by the blood stream to different organs\r\nand produce multiple abscesses. In septicaemia, the bacteria may occur in\r\nimmense numbers in the blood and produce a general infection of the\r\ntissues, causing a parboiled appearance of the liver, heart, voluntary\r\nmuscles and kidneys, and enlargement of the spleen. The two forms of\r\ninfection are often present at the same time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--_Staphylococcus pyogenes_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--_Streptococcus pyogenes_.]\r\n\r\n_The forms of bacteria_ that may cause blood poisoning are the\r\n_Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus_ and _albus_ (Fig. 97), _Streptococcus\r\npyogenes_ (Fig. 98), _Bacillus pyocyaneus_, _Bacillus coli communis_, and\r\nthe bacillus of malignant oedema (Figs. 99 and 100). The latter is included\r\nwith the bacteria that produce blood poisoning because it is a frequent\r\ncause of wound septicaemia. Subcutaneous, punctured, lacerated, contused\r\nand deep wounds without suitable drainage are the most suitable for the\r\ndevelopment of and infection of the tissues with the above germs. Wound\r\ninfection is most common during hot weather.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms are both general and local_. The tissues in the region of the\r\nwound become swollen and painful. In malignant oedema the swelling pits on\r\npressure, and if the wound is open, the surface becomes soft and may\r\nslough. The body temperature may be several degrees above the normal, the\r\nappetite is impaired or the animal stops eating and acts sleepy. A small\r\namount of highly-colored urine may be passed. Nervous symptoms, such as\r\nmuscular twitching, excited condition, delirium and paralysis, may be\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--Bacillus of malignant oedema, showing spores.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--Bacillus of malignant oedema.]\r\n\r\n_The prognosis is unfavorable_. In pyaemia the animal may live from a few\r\ndays to several months. Septicaemia usually terminates fatally in from two\r\nto ten days.\r\n\r\n_The treatment is largely preventive_. Wounds should be given prompt\r\nattention. They should be freed from all foreign substances and washed with\r\na disinfecting solution. A contused-lacerated wound should not be sutured\r\nif this interferes with the cleansing of it, and the escape of the wound\r\nsecretions. All punctured wounds should be enlarged so as to permit of\r\ntreatment and drainage.\r\n\r\nHEMORRHAGIC SEPTICAEMIA.--An acute infectious disease of ruminants and\r\nswine, characterized by hemorrhages in the different body tissues that\r\nappear as small red spots or blotches.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause of this disease_ is the _Bacillus bovisepticus_ (Fig.\r\n101). This bacillus probably enters the body tissues by way of the lining\r\nmembrane of the intestinal and respiratory tracts. In the northern States,\r\ncattle pasturing on marsh lands and swampy pastures are more often affected\r\nwith the disease in the late summer and fall than at other seasons of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe drinking of contaminated surface water that collects in muddy pools and\r\nponds may cause the disease. Cattle pasturing in stalk fields sometimes\r\nbecome infected in this way. Dusty sleeping quarters and small, crowded,\r\nmuddy yards seem to favor the development of the disease in hogs. Exposure,\r\ninsufficient exercise and careless feeding are the predisposing factors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--_Bacillus bovisepticus_.]\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ vary according to the animal and organ, or organs of the\r\nbody affected and the violence of the attack. The disease may be acute or\r\nsubacute. The brain and its membranes, lungs and air-passages and\r\nintestines may become affected. The symptoms may be classed under the head\r\nof nervous, respiratory and intestinal (Fig. 102), and they may be very\r\nunsatisfactory from the standpoint of diagnosis. The history and\r\npost-mortem lesions are of most value in the recognition of this disease.\r\nThe local conditions, the loss of several animals in the herd and the\r\nfinding of hemorrhagic lesions in the different body tissues may enable\r\nthe examiner to correctly diagnose the disease. It is very advisable in\r\norder to confirm the diagnosis to make a bacteriological examination of the\r\ntissues.\r\n\r\nThe acute form of the disease is very fatal. Animals that have the subacute\r\nform usually recover. The death-rate is between five and fifteen per cent\r\nof the herd. The mortality is heavier than this unless prompt preventive\r\nmeasures are taken.\r\n\r\n_Preventive treatment_ is of the greatest importance. Cattle that become\r\naffected when running on pasture should be moved, or in case a part of the\r\npasture is swampy, we may prevent further loss by fencing off this portion.\r\nDrinking places that are convenient and free from filth should be provided.\r\nWatering troughs and drinking fountains should be cleaned and disinfected\r\nevery few weeks. For this purpose, use a three per cent water solution of a\r\ncresol disinfectant, or a ten per cent water solution of sulfate of iron.\r\nDusty quarters should be cleaned and disinfected. Dirt floors may be\r\nsprinkled with crude oil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--A yearling steer affected with septicaemia\r\nhaemorrhagica, intestinal form.]\r\n\r\nWhen an outbreak of septicaemia haemorrhagica occurs in a herd, both the\r\nwell and sick animals should be given a physic. Cattle may be given\r\none-half pound of Epsom salts, repeated in three or four days; sheep and\r\nhogs from one to four ounces of raw linseed oil. Animals that have the\r\nsubacute form of the disease may be given stimulants, and iron and bitter\r\ntonics.\r\n\r\nANTHRAX, CHARBON.--This is an acute infectious disease affecting many\r\ndifferent species of animals. Anthrax is one of the oldest animal diseases,\r\nand early in the history of the race it existed as a plague in Egypt. It\r\nmost commonly affects cattle, sheep and horses. Man contracts the disease\r\nby handling wool and hides from animals that have died of anthrax, and by\r\naccidental inoculation in examining the carcass of animals that have died\r\nof the disease.\r\n\r\n_Cause_.--Anthrax is caused by a rod-shaped, spore-producing microorganism,\r\n_Bacillus anthracis_ (Fig. 103). It gains entrance to the body by way of\r\nthe intestinal tract, lungs and air-passages and the skin. The bites of\r\ninsects play an important part in the distribution of the disease in some\r\nlocalities, but the most common method of infection is by way of the\r\ndigestive tract, through eating and drinking food and water contaminated\r\nwith the anthrax germs. The spores of the _B. anthracis_ are very resistant\r\nto changes in temperature and drying. They may live for years in rich,\r\nmoist inundated soils. River-bottom and swampy lands that have become\r\ninfected with discharges from the bodies of animals sick with anthrax, and\r\nby burying the carcasses of animals that have died of this disease, retain\r\nthe infection for many years. Anthrax is very widely distributed. It is the\r\nmost prevalent in the southern portion of the United States, especially the\r\nlower portion of the Mississippi Valley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--_Bacillus anthracis_.]\r\n\r\n_The symptoms vary in different cases_, depending on the organs affected,\r\nand the virulence and amount of virus introduced. The _apoplectic form_ is\r\nvery acute. The disease sets in suddenly; the animal trembles, staggers,\r\nfalls and dies in a convulsion. Blood may be discharged from the nose and\r\nwith the urine and faeces.\r\n\r\nIn the _abdominal form_, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, prolapse of the rectum,\r\nbloating and doughy swellings in the region of the abdomen occur.\r\n\r\nIn the _thoracic form_, the symptoms are bloody discharge from the\r\nnostrils, salivation, rapid, difficult breathing and swelling in the region\r\nof the throat. Local or skin lesions may occur in conjunction with, or\r\nindependent of, the above forms of disease. These are carbuncles one or two\r\ninches in diameter that are hot and tender at first, but later become\r\ngangrenous, diffused swellings.\r\n\r\nOn post-mortem examination the blood is found tarry and dark, and bloody\r\nexudates may be found in the abdominal and thoracic cavities. The spleen is\r\nsoft and two or three times larger than normal. The diagnosis should be\r\nconfirmed by finding the _B. anthracis_ in the blood and tissues. The\r\ndeath-rate is very high, usually about seventy-five per cent.\r\n\r\n_The treatment is preventive._ Animals should be kept away from lots and\r\npastures where deaths from anthrax have been known to occur, unless\r\nimmunized against the disease. Marshy, swampy land that is infected with\r\nthe germs of anthrax should be drained and cultivated.\r\n\r\nWhen an outbreak of the disease occurs, all of the animals should be\r\nvaccinated. The carcasses of the animals that die should be cremated at or\r\nnear the place where they die. If hauled or dragged, the necessary\r\nprecautions should be taken against scattering the infectious material from\r\nthe carcass, and plenty of disinfectants used. Persons attending the\r\nanimals should be warned against opening or handling the carcass without\r\nprotecting the hands with rubber gloves.\r\n\r\n_Anthrax vaccine_ should not be used by incompetent persons.\r\n\r\nULCERATIVE STOMATITIS. (ULCERATIVE SORE MOUTH.)--This is an infectious\r\ndisease of young animals. Pigs from a few days to a few weeks of age are\r\nthe most commonly affected.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause_ of ulcerative sore mouths is the _Bacillus\r\nnecrophorus_ (Fig. 104). The infectious agent is distributed by the udder\r\nof the mother becoming soiled with filth from the stable floor and yards,\r\nand by affected pigs nursing mothers of healthy litters. Filth, sharp teeth\r\nand irritation to the gums from the eruption of the teeth are important\r\npredisposing factors.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are, at first, an inflammation of the mucous membrane lining\r\nthe lips and cheeks and covering the gums. The inflamed parts are first\r\nswollen and a deep red color; later, white patches form and the part\r\nsloughs, leaving a deep ulcer. As ulceration progresses, difficulty in\r\nnursing increases until finally the young animal is unable to suckle. If\r\nulceration of the mouth is extensive, the animal may be feverish, dull and\r\nlose flesh rapidly. Portions of the lips, gums and snout may slough off.\r\nThe death-rate in pigs is very high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--_Bacillus necrophorus_.]\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in keeping the quarters and yards in a\r\nsanitary condition, and using all possible precautions against the\r\nintroduction of the disease into the herd. The diseased young and mother\r\nshould be separated from the herd and the quarters disinfected daily. The\r\nmouths of all the young should be examined daily and the diseased animals\r\ntreated. The ulcers should be scraped or curetted and cauterized with lunar\r\ncaustic, and the mouth washed daily with a two per cent water solution of a\r\ncresol disinfectant. Dipping pigs headforemost into a water solution of\r\npermanganate of potassium (one-half teaspoonful dissolved in a gallon of\r\nwater), twice daily, may be practised if the herd is large.\r\n\r\nIt is usually most economical to kill the badly diseased animals, as they\r\nusually die or become badly stunted.\r\n\r\nRABIES, HYDROPHOBIA.--Rabies is an infectious disease affecting the nervous\r\nsystem, that is transmitted by the bite of a rabid animal and the\r\ninoculation of the wound with the virus present in the saliva. It is\r\ncommonly considered a disease of dogs, but because of the disposition of\r\nrabid dogs to bite other animals, rabies is common in domestic animals and\r\nman.\r\n\r\nRabies is widely distributed, being most prevalent in the temperate zone,\r\nand where the population is most dense. It has been excluded from\r\nAustralia, Tasmania and New Zealand by a rigid inspection and quarantine of\r\nall imported dogs.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause of rabies_ is probably a protozoan parasite (the Negri\r\nbodies present in nerve-cells, Fig. 105). The germ spreads from the wounds\r\nthrough the nerves and central nervous system. The disease-producing\r\norganisms are present in great numbers in the nerve-tissue and saliva.\r\n\r\n_The period of incubation_ varies from a few days to several months. It is\r\nusually from ten to seventy days.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ differ in the different species. There are two forms of the\r\ndisease: the _furious_ and the _dumb_. The former is more common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--Negri bodies in nerve-tissue.]\r\n\r\n_In the dog, the symptoms may be divided into three stages_. The first, or\r\n_melancholy stage_, usually lasts from twelve to forty-eight hours. The\r\nanimal's behavior is altered and it becomes sullen, irritable and nervous.\r\nSometimes it is friendly and inclined to lick the hand of its master. An\r\ninclination to gnaw or swallow indigestible objects is sometimes noted.\r\nFrequently a certain part of the skin is rubbed or licked.\r\n\r\nThe second, or _furious stage_, may last several days. Violent nervous or\r\nrabid symptoms are manifested, and the dog may leave home and travel long\r\ndistances. The animal usually shows a strong inclination to bite. It may\r\nmove about snapping at imaginary objects in its delirium, and may bite any\r\nperson or animal with which it comes in contact. The bark is peculiar, the\r\nappetite is lost and the animal becomes weak and emaciated.\r\n\r\nIn the third, or _paralytic stage_, the dog may present an emaciated,\r\ndirty, ragged appearance. The lower jaw may drop, the tongue hangs from the\r\nlips and the eyes appear sunken and glassy. Paralysis of the hind parts may\r\nbe present.\r\n\r\n_In the dumb form_, the paralytic symptoms predominate and the disease\r\npursues a short course. Rabies terminates in death in from four to ten\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n_Furious rabies_ is more common in the _horse_. The animal is very nervous,\r\nrestless and alert. It may attack other animals in a vicious manner,\r\nkicking and biting them. The animal does not seem to care to eat or drink,\r\nand usually shows violent nervous symptoms, such as biting the manger,\r\nrearing and kicking when confined in the stable.\r\n\r\n_Cattle_ butt with the horns and show a tendency to lick other animals.\r\nThey bellow more than common and the sexual desire is increased. Paralytic\r\nsymptoms are manifested early in the disease, and the animal may fall when\r\nmoving about. They soon present a gaunt, emaciated appearance.\r\n\r\nIn dogs the diagnosis is confirmed by a _microscopical examination_ of the\r\nvagus ganglia and that portion of the brain known as Amnion's horn, and the\r\nfinding of Negri bodies in the nerve-cells. In case a person is bitten by a\r\ndog, the animal should be confined until the disease is well advanced and\r\nkilled or allowed to die. The head should then be removed and forwarded to\r\nthe State laboratory, or wherever such examinations are made.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is preventive. Wherever an outbreak of rabies occurs all\r\ndogs should be confined on the owner's premises or muzzled. All dogs\r\nrunning at large without muzzles should be promptly killed. A heavy tax on\r\ndogs, and the killing of all dogs not wearing a license tag, would prevent\r\nthe heavy financial loss resulting from rabies, and the ravages of\r\nwandering dogs in the United States. In countries where the muzzling of\r\ndogs is enforced during the entire year, rabies is a rare disease.\r\n\r\nFOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.--This is a highly contagious and infectious disease\r\nof cattle, sheep, goats and swine. It is characterized by the eruption of\r\nvesicles on the mucous membrane lining the mouth, the lips, between and\r\nabove the claws and in the region of the udder and perineum. Man may\r\ncontract the disease by caring for sick animals; or by drinking raw milk\r\nfrom a sick cow. Babies are most susceptible to infection from milk.\r\n\r\nFoot-and-mouth disease was introduced into eastern Europe from the steppes\r\nof Prussia and Asia near the end of the eighteenth century. It was\r\nintroduced into England about 1839, and in 1870 into Canada through the\r\nimportation of cattle from England. From Canada the disease spread to the\r\nUnited States. Very few animals were infected during the 1870 outbreak, and\r\nthe disease was quickly stamped out in both countries.\r\n\r\nEurope has been unable to eradicate foot-and-mouth disease. The different\r\noutbreaks that occur from time to time cause enormous financial loss. In\r\nthe United States outbreaks of the disease have occurred in the following\r\nyears: 1870, 1884, 1902-'03, 1908 and 1914-'15. In the first two outbreaks\r\nvery few cattle contracted the disease, and the infection was quickly\r\nstamped out. The third and fourth outbreaks were more extensive, and it was\r\nnecessary to slaughter several thousand cattle and hogs in order to\r\neradicate the disease. The first four outbreaks occurred in the eastern\r\nStates, and the disease was prevented from spreading to the principal\r\nlive-stock centers of the country, and the leading stock-raising States by\r\nslaughtering the diseased and exposed animals and by county and State\r\nquarantines. Early in the 1914-'15 outbreak, the disease spread to the\r\nChicago Stock Yards, and from there, through shipments of cattle, to the\r\nprincipal live-stock sections of the country. The financial loss resulting\r\nfrom this outbreak has amounted to several million dollars. The Federal and\r\nState authorities have always been successful in stamping out the disease\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause_ of foot-and-mouth disease is a filterable virus that\r\nis present in the serum from the vesicles, the saliva, milk, and various\r\nbody secretions and excretions from the sick animal. In the early stage of\r\nthe disease it is present in the blood. None of the many investigators have\r\nbeen able to discover the microorganism that produces the disease.\r\n\r\nTwo of the outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease in the United States\r\noriginated from an infected vaccine used for the inoculation of vaccine\r\nheifers. The origin of the 1914-'15 outbreak has not been discovered. When\r\nintroduced into a country, the disease spreads rapidly, through the\r\nmovement of live-stock affected by the disease. Animals recently recovered\r\nmay infect other animals. Dogs, birds, people, vehicles, milk, roughage,\r\ngrains and other material from an infected farm may spread the disease.\r\n\r\n_The period of incubation is short_. Symptoms of disease may be manifested\r\nin from one to six days following exposure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--A cow affected with foot-and-mouth disease. Note\r\nthe accumulation of saliva about the lips. (From report of the Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry.)]\r\n\r\n_The first symptoms_ are fever, dulness, trembling and loss of appetite.\r\nThis is followed by vesicles or blisters forming on the mucous membrane of\r\nthe mouth, lips, between and above the claws and the region of the udder.\r\nThe inflammation of the mouth and feet may be very painful. Long strings of\r\nsaliva may dribble from the mouth and collect about the lips (Fig. 106). A\r\nsmacking or \"clucking\" sound is produced when the animal moves its jaws and\r\nlips. The severe pain resulting from the inflammation of the mouth and\r\nfeet, and the difficulty in moving about and eating and drinking, cause the\r\nanimal to lose flesh and become emaciated. Milk cows may go dry.\r\n\r\n_The death-rate is not heavy_. Some writers place it as low as two or three\r\nper cent. Because of the erosions and sloughing of the tissues of the\r\nmouth, feet and udder it becomes necessary to kill many of the animals.\r\nYoung animals frequently die of inflammation of the digestive tract. The\r\nimmunity conferred by an attack of the disease is not permanent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--Slaughtering a herd of cattle affected with\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease. (Photographed by S. J. Craig, County Agricultural\r\nAgent, Crown Point, Indiana.)]\r\n\r\nThe most economical measures of _prevention and control_ are to buy and\r\nslaughter all diseased and exposed animals, bury the carcasses in\r\nquicklime, disinfect the premises (Figs. 107, 108 and 109) and enforce a\r\ndistrict, county and State quarantine, until after the infection has died\r\nout. This statement may not hold true of methods of control in countries\r\nwhere foot-and-mouth disease is widely distributed.\r\n\r\nTETANUS. LOCKJAW.--This is an acute infectious disease that is\r\ncharacterized by spasmodic contractions of voluntary muscles. The specific\r\ngerm remains at the point of infection, and produces toxins that cause\r\ntetanic contractions of the muscles. It commonly affects horses, mules,\r\ncattle, sheep and swine. The disease is most common in warm, temperate\r\nclimates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--Disinfecting boots and coats before leaving a\r\nfarm where cattle have been inspected for foot-and-mouth disease.\r\n(Photographed by S.

Craig, County Agricultural Agent, Crown Point,\r\nIndiana.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Cleaning up and disinfecting premises where an\r\noutbreak of foot-and-mouth disease has occurred.]\r\n\r\nThe _specific cause_ is a pin-shaped germ, the _Bacillus tetani_ (Fig.\r\n110), that is present in the soil, especially those that are rich and well\r\nmanured. The germ enters the body by way of a wound, especially punctured\r\nwounds. Infection may take place through some wound in the mucous membrane\r\nlining the mouth, or other parts of the digestive tract. Infection may\r\nfollow a surgical operation, such as castration. In any case, the germ\r\nrequires an absence of air (oxygen) for its development.\r\n\r\n_The period of incubation_ varies from one to two weeks, the length of time\r\ndepending on the nearness of the wound to a large nerve trunk or brain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--_Bacillus tetani_.]\r\n\r\nThe first _symptom_ observed is a stiffness of the muscles, especially\r\nthose nearest the point of inoculation or wound. The muscles of the head,\r\nneck, back and loins are often affected first, and when pressed upon with\r\nthe fingers feel hard and rigid. The disease rapidly extends, producing\r\nspasms of other muscles of the body. In breathing, the ribs show less\r\nmovement than normal, the head is held in one position and higher than\r\nusual, the ears are stiff or pricked, the nostrils dilated, the lips rigid\r\nor drawn back and the eyes retracted, causing the \"third eyelid\" to\r\nprotrude over a portion of the eye (Fig. 111). In most cases the muscles of\r\nmastication and swallowing are affected. The animal may be unable to open\r\nits mouth and swallows with difficulty. When standing, the limbs are spread\r\nout so as to increase the base of support, and in acute cases about to\r\nterminate fatally, the pulse is quick and small and the respiration\r\nshallow, rapid and labored. The animal sweats profusely, falls down and\r\nstruggles violently, but remains conscious to the end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--Head of horse affected with tetanus, showing\r\n\"third eyelid\" protruding over the eye.]\r\n\r\nIn the _subacute form_ (Fig. 112) the symptoms are mild, and the animal may\r\nbe able to move about, eat and drink without very great effort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--A subacute case of tetanus.]\r\n\r\n_Treatment_ is largely preventive. All wounds should be carefully\r\ndisinfected. This is especially advisable in punctured wounds of the foot.\r\nIn communities, or on premises where tetanus is a common disease, animals\r\nthat have punctured or open wounds should be given a protective dose of\r\ntetanus antitoxin.\r\n\r\n_The curative treatment_ is largely good care. If a wound is present, it\r\nshould be thoroughly disinfected. The animal may be supported by placing it\r\nin a sling. A comfortable box-stall, where the animal is not annoyed by\r\nnoises or worried by other animals, is to be preferred. A fresh pail of\r\nwater should be given the animal several times daily.\r\n\r\n_The course_ of the disease varies. Death may occur within a few days, or\r\nthe disease may last two or three weeks. Animals that recover from tetanus\r\nmay show symptoms of the disease for several weeks. The death-rate is\r\nhighest in hot climates and during the summer months.\r\n\r\nIf the animal can eat, it is not advisable to feed a heavy ration of\r\nroughage or grain. A very light diet of soft food, such as chops and\r\nbran-mash, prevents constipation and encourages recovery. Drugs that have a\r\nrelaxing effect on the muscles may be given. Tetanus antitoxin may be given\r\nin large doses.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. What is septicaemia and pyaemia?\r\n\r\n2. What is haemorrhagic septicaemia?

DISTEMPER.--This is an acute infectious disease associated with\r\na catarrhal condition of the air-passages and suppuration of the lymphatic\r\nglands in the region of the throat. Colts are the most susceptible to the\r\ndisease. One attack renders the animal immune against a second attack of\r\nthe disease, but the immunity is not always permanent.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause_, _Streptococcus equi_ (Fig. 113), was discovered by\r\nSchutz in 1888. Strangles is commonly spread by exposing susceptible\r\nanimals to diseased animals, either by direct contact, or by exposing them\r\nto the infection in the stable and allowing them to drink or eat food from\r\nwatering and feeding troughs on premises where the disease exists. The\r\npredisposing causes are cold and sudden changes in the weather. For this\r\nreason the disease is most prevalent during the late winter and early\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--Streptococcus of strangles.]\r\n\r\n_The period of incubation varies_, usually from four to eight days.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ at the beginning of the attack are a feverish condition and\r\npartial loss of appetite. The visible mucous membranes are red and dry.\r\nThis is followed by watery nasal secretions that become heavy and purulent\r\nwithin a few days. The inflammation may extend to the larynx and pharynx.\r\n\r\nThe glands in the region of the jaw become hot, swollen and painful, and\r\nthe animal may be unable to eat or drink. The swelling and inflammation of\r\nthe throat, and the heavy, pus-like secretions that accumulate in the nasal\r\ncavities, cause difficult respirations. After a few days the abscesses\r\nusually break, and the symptoms are less severe. If the abscesses break on\r\nthe inside of the throat, the discharge from the nostrils is increased.\r\n\r\nThe disease may be accompanied by an eruption of nodules, or vesicles on\r\nthe skin, or nasal mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nIn severe and chronic cases multiple abscesses may form. This complication\r\nis indicated by emaciation and weakness. Such cases usually terminate in\r\ndeath. Severe inflammation and swelling in the region of the throat may\r\nterminate in strangulation and death. The death-rate is from one to three\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in using all possible precautions to\r\nprevent the exposure of susceptible animals and practising the immunization\r\nof exposed animals. The curative treatment is principally careful nursing.\r\nRest, a comfortable stall, nourishing feed and good care constitute the\r\nnecessary treatment for the average case of distemper. When the abscesses\r\nbecome mature, they should be opened and washed with a disinfectant.\r\nSteaming the animal several times daily relieves difficult breathing and\r\nthe irritated condition of the mucous membranes. In case the abscesses do\r\nnot form promptly and the throat is badly swollen, a blistering ointment or\r\nliniment may be applied. Bitter and saline tonics, the same as recommended\r\nin the treatment of indigestion, may be given with the feed.\r\n\r\nINFLUENZA (CATARRHAL OR SHIPPING FEVER).--This is a well-known acute\r\ninfectious disease of solipeds. It is characterized by depression, high\r\nbody temperature and catarrhal inflammation of the respiratory and other\r\nmucous membranes.\r\n\r\nSeveral epidemics of influenza have occurred in the United States. The most\r\nserious epidemic occurred in the latter part of the '70's, and the last one\r\nin 1900-'01. Influenza is present in the principal horse centers in a\r\nsomewhat attenuated form.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause_ of the disease has never been determined. The virus is\r\npresent in the expired air, nasal secretions and excreta. Close proximity\r\nto a diseased animal is not necessary in order to contract the disease.\r\nStables may harbor the infection, and it may be distributed by such disease\r\ncarriers as blankets, harness, clothing of the attendant and dust.\r\n\r\n_The predisposing causes_ are cold, exposure and changes in climate. When\r\nthe disease appears in a country, it is first present in the large cities,\r\nand from there it is scattered to the outlying districts. The _period of\r\nincubation_ is usually from four to seven days.\r\n\r\n_The early symptoms_ of the disease are a high fever, marked depression and\r\npartial or entire loss of appetite. The horse usually stands in the stall\r\nwith the head down and appears sleepy. The visible and respiratory mucous\r\nmembranes are inflamed, the respirations are quickened and the animal may\r\ncough. The eyes are frequently affected, the lids and cornea showing more\r\nor less inflammation. The digestive tract may be affected. At the\r\nbeginning, colicky pains may be present and later constipation and\r\ndiarrhoea. Symptoms of a serious nervous disturbance are sometimes\r\nmanifested.\r\n\r\nThe limbs usually become swollen or filled. This disappears as the animal\r\nbegins to improve. Pregnant mares may abort. The death-rate is low.\r\n\r\n_The treatment required for the sick animals_ is largely rest, a light diet\r\nand a comfortable, clean, well-ventilated stall, free from draughts.\r\nWindows in the stall should be darkened. If the stable is cold, the body of\r\nthe animal should be covered with a blanket and the limbs bandaged. Two\r\nounces of alcohol and one drachm of quinine may be given three or four\r\ntimes daily. Small doses of raw linseed oil may be given if necessary.\r\n\r\nHorses that are exposed to cold, wet weather or worked after becoming sick,\r\nfrequently suffer from pneumonia, pericarditis, gastro-enteritis and other\r\ndiseases. Such complications should be given prompt treatment.\r\n\r\nIt is very advisable to give a protective serum to horses that are shipped\r\nor transported long distances, and exposed to the disease in sale or\r\ntransfer stables.\r\n\r\nGLANDERS, FARCY.--This is a contagious and infectious disease of solipeds\r\nthat is characterized by the formation of nodules and ulcers on the skin,\r\nnasal mucous membrane and lungs.\r\n\r\nAlthough glanders is one of the oldest of animal diseases, it was not until\r\n1868 that its contagious character was demonstrated. The disease is widely\r\ndistributed. It became more prevalent in the United States after the Civil\r\nWar. The vigorous control measures practised by the State and Federal\r\nhealth officers have greatly decreased the percentage of animals affected\r\nwith glanders. At the present time the disease is more often met with in\r\nthe large cities than in the agricultural sections of the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--_Bacillus mallei_.]\r\n\r\n_The specific cause of glanders is the Bacillus mallei_ (Fig. 114). This\r\nmicroorganism was discovered in 1882. It is present in the discharges from\r\nthe nasal mucous membrane and the ulcers. These discharges may become\r\ndeposited upon the feed troughs, mangers, stalls, harness, buckets,\r\nwatering troughs, drinking fountains and attendants' hands and clothing.\r\nHealthy horses living in the same stable with the glandered animals may\r\nescape infection for months. It is usually the diseased animal's mate, or\r\nthe one standing in an adjoining stall, that is first affected. Catarrhal\r\ndiseases predispose animals to glanders, as the normal resistance of the\r\nmucous membranes is thereby reduced. The most common routes by which the\r\ngerm enters the body are by way of the digestive and respiratory tracts. It\r\nmay enter the body through the uninjured mucous membranes of the\r\nrespiratory tract and genital organs, or through wounds of the skin.\r\n\r\n_The period of incubation_ may be from a few to many days.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ may be _acute_ or _chronic_ in nature. The _acute form_\r\npursues a rapid course. It is frequently seen in mules and asses, and it\r\nmay develop from the subacute or chronic form in horses. When the disease\r\nis acute, the animal has a fever, is stupid, does not eat, and may have a\r\ndiarrhoea. In this form the lymphatic glands suppurate, the animal loses\r\nflesh rapidly and dies in from one to two weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Nasal septum showing nodules and ulcers.]\r\n\r\nThe _chronic form_ is the most common. It develops slowly and lasts for\r\nyears. The early symptoms of the disease (chilling and fever) usually\r\nescape notice. The first visible symptom is a nasal discharge of a dirty\r\nwhite color from one or both nostrils. This is usually scanty at first, and\r\nintermittent, but later becomes quite abundant. The discharge is very\r\nsticky, and adheres to the hair and skin. The most frequent seat of the\r\ndisease is in the respiratory organs, lymph glands and skin. Nodules and\r\nulcers appear on the nasal mucous membrane (Fig. 115), but they may be so\r\nhigh up as to escape notice. The ulcers are very characteristic of the\r\ndisease. They are angry looking, with ragged, raised margins, and when they\r\nheal leave a puckered scar. The submaxillary glands may be enlarged, and at\r\nfirst more or less hard and painful, but later they become nodular and\r\nadhere to the jaw or skin. Nodules and ulcers may form on the skin over the\r\ninferior wall of the abdomen and the inside of the hind limbs and are known\r\nas \"farcy buds.\" Lymphatic vessels near these buds become swollen and hard.\r\nThe animal loses flesh rapidly, does not withstand hard work, and the limbs\r\nusually swell.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes difficult to diagnose the disease. The ulcers on the nasal\r\nmucous membranes and elsewhere are very characteristic, and when present\r\nenable the examiner to form a diagnosis. In cases of doubt, a\r\nbacteriological examination of the nasal discharge may be made, or we may\r\nresort to one or several of the various diagnostic tests. The Mallein test\r\nis quite commonly used. The sterilized products of a culture of the _B.\r\nmallei_ are injected beneath the skin of the suspected animal. This causes\r\na rise in body temperature and a hot, characteristic swelling at the point\r\nof injection in glandered animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--_Streptococcus pyogenes equi_.]\r\n\r\n_Treatment is not recommended_ at the present time. Nearly all of the\r\nStates have laws which aim to stamp out the disease wherever found by\r\nkilling all affected animals, and thoroughly disinfecting the stables,\r\nharness and everything which has been near the animal. Diseased animals\r\nshould be carefully isolated until slaughtered, and all animals exposed to\r\nthem should be subsequently tested for glanders.\r\n\r\nCONTAGIOUS PLEUROPNEUMONIA (STABLE PNEUMONIA).--This is an infectious\r\ndisease of solipeds that usually results in a fatal inflammation of the\r\nlungs and pleural membrane.\r\n\r\nMany writers have described this disease as associated with influenza, but\r\nit is frequently seen as a separate disease, usually involving only the\r\nlungs and pleurae. It is prevalent in several parts of the United States,\r\nmore particularly the horse centers or large markets, where it appears in\r\nthe form of epidemics. In several of these localities it is known as\r\nwestern or stable fever.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause is not definitely known_. The _Streptococcus pyogenes\r\nequi_ (Fig. 116) is very commonly present. This germ grows in the diseased\r\ntissues. The disease is spread by direct or indirect contact, as when well\r\nor susceptible animals are placed in the same stable with an animal\r\naffected with the disease, or in stalls which have recently held diseased\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n_The period of incubation_ is from four to ten days following exposure.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are those commonly seen at the beginning of an attack of\r\nsimple pneumonia and pleurisy. They consist of chills, high fever, cough,\r\ndepression, difficult and labored breathing and loss of appetite. The\r\ndisease usually runs a course of from one to three weeks. The death-rate is\r\nthirty per cent or more.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is mainly preventive. Stables where horses having\r\npleuropneumonia have been kept should be cleaned and disinfected by\r\nspraying the floors, stalls and walls with a four per cent water solution\r\nof a cresol disinfectant. It is advisable to subject all newly-purchased\r\nanimals to a short quarantine period before allowing them to mix with the\r\nother animals in the stable. Exposed animals may be given a protective\r\nserum.\r\n\r\n_The curative treatment_ is the same as recommended for the treatment of\r\nsimple pneumonia and pleurisy.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. What is the specific cause of distemper? Give the symptoms and\r\n   treatment.\r\n\r\n2. What are the different methods of spreading influenza? Give the symptoms\r\n   and treatment.\r\n\r\n3.

The disease is common in cattle and\r\nusually affects the bones and soft parts of the head. In the United States,\r\nwhere the disease is known as \"lumpy jaw\" the jawbone is commonly affected.\r\nIn European countries the disease frequently involves the tongue, and the\r\nterm \"wooden tongue\" is applied to it. The disease may affect regions of\r\nthe body other than the head. Actinomycosis of the lungs sometimes occurs.\r\nSwine and horses may be affected by this disease.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause_ of actinomycosis is commonly known as the ray fungus\r\n(Fig. 118). This fungus grows on certain plants, and the animal usually\r\ncontracts the disease by eating plants or roughage that have the fungus on\r\nthem. Grasses having awns that are capable of wounding the mucous membrane\r\nof the mouth and penetrating the gums are most apt to produce the disease.\r\nYoung cattle that are replacing and erupting their teeth are most prone to\r\n\"lumpy jaw.\" Conditions that favor bruising of the jaw and external wounds\r\nfavor the development of actinomycosis.\r\n\r\nThe fungus grows in the tissues, causing an inflammatory reaction and\r\ndestruction of the tissue. The ray fungus can be seen in the diseased\r\ntissue or the pus as yellowish, spherical bodies about the size of a grain\r\nof sand. Each of these bodies is formed by a large number of club-like\r\nbodies arranged about a central mass of filaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--The ray fungus.]\r\n\r\n_The local symptoms_ are characteristic (Fig. 117). The tumor may involve\r\nthe soft tissues of the head. If the jawbone is affected the tumor feels\r\nhard and cannot be moved about. Sometimes it is soft and filled with pus.\r\nTumors of long standing may possess uneven, nodular surfaces and fistulous\r\nopenings. When the tongue is affected, it is swollen and painful, and\r\nprehension and mastication of the food may be impossible. When the pharynx\r\nis the seat of disease, breathing and swallowing are difficult and painful.\r\nActinomycosis of the lungs may present the appearance of a chronic\r\npulmonary affection. If the disease involves the head and lungs, the animal\r\nmay become unthrifty and emaciated. In doubtful cases a microscopic\r\nexamination of a piece of the tumor, or some of the pus, may be necessary.\r\n\r\n_The treatment is surgical and medicinal_. Small, external tumors may be\r\nremoved by an operation. Sometimes an incision is made into the diseased\r\ntissue and a caustic preparation introduced.\r\n\r\nThe most desirable method of treatment is the administration of large doses\r\nof iodide of potassium in a drench, or in the drinking water. The dose is\r\nfrom one to three drachms daily for a period of seven to fourteen days. The\r\nsize of the dose depends on the size of the animal and its susceptibility\r\nto iodism. An animal weighing 1000 pounds may be given two drachms. The\r\ntreatment is kept up until the symptoms of iodism develop. The condition is\r\nindicated by a loss of appetite and a catarrhal discharge from the eyes and\r\nnostrils. When this occurs, the treatment should be stopped, and the animal\r\ndrenched with one-half pound of Epsom salts, and the dose repeated after\r\nthree or four days. After an interval of two weeks, the iodide of potassium\r\ntreatment should be repeated if the growth of the tumor is not checked.\r\n\r\nEMPHYSEMATOUS ANTHRAX, \"BLACK LEG.\"--\"Black leg\" is an acute infectious\r\ndisease of cattle that is characterized by lameness and superficial\r\nswellings in the region of the shoulder, quarter or neck. The swellings are\r\nhot and painful and usually contain gas.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause_ of \"black leg\" is a rod-shaped, spore-producing germ,\r\nthe bacillus of emphysematous anthrax (Fig. 119). This germ possesses great\r\nvitality, and may live indefinitely in the soil. It has been known to live\r\nfor years in clay and undrained soils. Young animals that are in high\r\ncondition are predisposed to the disease.\r\n\r\nThe germ enters the body through abrasions in the skin and mucous membrane\r\nof the mouth and intestines.\r\n\r\n\"Black leg\" is a common disease of young cattle in all sections of the\r\ncountry where cattle-raising is engaged in extensively. Outbreaks of the\r\ndisease are most prevalent in the early spring after the snow has melted,\r\nand in the late summer in localities where cattle graze over the dried-up\r\nponds and swampy places in the pasture. The germs of black leg may be\r\ncarried from a farm where the disease is prevalent to non-infected premises\r\nby surface water. The opening up of drainage ditches through stock-raising\r\ncommunities may be followed by outbreaks of the disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--Bacillus of emphysematous anthrax.]\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ of black leg develop quickly and may terminate fatally in a\r\nfew hours. These are general dulness, stiffness, prostration and loss of\r\nappetite. Lameness is a prominent symptom. The animal may show a swelling\r\nin the regions of the shoulder and hindquarters or on other parts of the\r\nbody. The swelling is very hot and painful at first, but if the animal\r\nlives for a time, it becomes less tender, crackles when pressed on and the\r\nskin may feel cold and leathery. Fever is a constant symptom. In the highly\r\nacute form of the disease nervous symptoms, such as convulsions and coma,\r\noccur.\r\n\r\n_The tissue changes_ in the region of the swelling are characteristic. An\r\nincision into the swelling shows a bloody, dark exudate and the surface of\r\nthe muscular tissue is dark. Frothy, bloody liquid escapes from the mouth,\r\nnose and anus.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in thoroughly draining pastures and\r\nyards where cattle run. This measure does not insure cattle against the\r\ndisease. Cattle that die of \"black leg\" should be cremated. This should be\r\ndone at the spot where the animal dies. If the carcass is moved or opened,\r\nthe ground should be thoroughly wet with a four per cent water solution of\r\na cresol disinfectant and covered with lime.\r\n\r\n_Vaccination_ of the exposed or susceptible animals should be practised. On\r\nfarms where the disease exists it may be necessary to vaccinate the young\r\nanimals (less than two years of age) once or twice every year in order to\r\nprevent the disease. Medicinal treatment is unsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nTEXAS OR TICK FEVER.--Tick fever is an infectious disease of cattle. It is\r\ncaused by an animal organism that is present in the blood, and is conveyed\r\nfrom the animal that is host for the tick fever parasite to the\r\nnon-infected animal by a tick (Figs. 120 and 121).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--Cattle tick (male).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--Cattle tick (female).]\r\n\r\nTick fever was introduced into the southern portion of the United States\r\nthrough importation of cattle by the Spaniards. Previous to the\r\nestablishing of a definite quarantine line between the permanently infected\r\nand the non-infected sections, heavy losses among northern cattle resulted\r\nthrough driving and shipping southern cattle through the northern States.\r\nThe specific cause and the part taken by the tick in its distribution were\r\nnot discovered until 1889-'90. Smith recognized and discovered the specific\r\ncause of the disease, and Kilborn and Salmon proved by a series of\r\nexperiments that the cattle tick was responsible for the transmission of\r\nthe disease from animal to animal.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause_ of tick fever is a protozoan parasite, _Piroplasma\r\nbigeminum_ (Fig. 122). It is present in the blood of cattle that are\r\naffected with this disease. The natural method of entrance into the body is\r\nthrough the bite of the cattle tick. The disease may be transmitted by\r\ninoculating blood containing the parasite into a susceptible animal.\r\n\r\nThere are two forms of the disease, the _acute_ and _chronic_.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms of the acute form_ of the disease are a high fever,\r\ndepression, loss of appetite, diarrhoea, dark or bloody urine, staggering\r\ngait and delirium. Death may occur within a few days from the time the\r\nfirst symptoms are manifested.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms of the chronic form_ of the disease resemble the acute form,\r\nbut are more mild. The animal is unthrifty and loses flesh rapidly. The\r\nbloodless condition of the body is manifested by the pale, visible mucous\r\nmembrane. Death seldom occurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--Blood-cells with _Piroplasma bigeminum_ in them.]\r\n\r\nThe most characteristic _diseased changes_ found on post-mortem examination\r\noccur in the liver and spleen. The liver is enlarged, and a yellowish,\r\nmahogany-brown color. The gallbladder is filled with a very thick bile. The\r\nspleen may be several times the normal size and dark colored. When it is\r\ncut into, the pulpy tissue may resemble thick, dark blood. The kidneys are\r\npale and the bladder may contain dark or reddish-colored urine.\r\n\r\nIn the northern States and outside of the quarantined area, the direct or\r\nindirect exposure of the affected cattle to southern cattle, and the\r\npresence of the cattle tick, _Margarophus annulatus_, are sufficient\r\nevidence to confirm the diagnosis of this disease.\r\n\r\n_The prevention and control_ depend on destruction of the cattle tick. In\r\nthe early history of the disease, shipping and driving of southern cattle\r\ninto and through the northern States caused outbreaks of tick fever and\r\nheavy losses among northern cattle. This finally resulted in the locating\r\nof the infected district, and the establishment of the Texas-fever\r\nquarantine line in 1891 by Dr. D. E. Salmon.\r\n\r\nPrevious to this time Kilborne and Salmon proved that the cattle tick was\r\nessential to the spread and production of the disease. A further study of\r\nthe life history of the tick resulted in the discovery that it could not\r\nmature unless it became a parasite of horses, mules, or cattle. This has\r\nled to the eradication of the tick in certain sections of the South, by not\r\nallowing cattle access to a pasture or lot for a certain period, and by\r\nfreeing the animals from ticks by hand-picking, dipping and smearing.\r\n\r\nThe immunization of cattle that are shipped into an infected district for\r\nbreeding purposes is often practised. Immunity is obtained by introducing\r\nthe P. bigeminun into the blood, either by placing a few virulent young\r\nticks upon the animal, or by repeated inoculation with a very small\r\nquantity of virulent blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1.

This microorganism is transmitted to the healthy birds by the feed,\r\nor water becoming contaminated with the discharges from the diseased birds.\r\nAccording to Salmon, the period of incubating varies from four to twenty\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n_The early symptoms_ are a falling off in appetite, high fever, dulness,\r\ndiarrhoea and weakness. The affected bird becomes drowsy, the head is drawn\r\ntoward the body, and it may remain asleep for long periods at a time.\r\nSalmon states that the general outline of the sick bird becomes spherical\r\nor ball-shaped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--_Bacillus avisepticus_.]\r\n\r\nThe disease is usually highly fatal. In the acute form the larger portion\r\nof the flock may die off within a week. In the subacute and chronic forms,\r\nthe birds become greatly emaciated, and a few die off weekly through a\r\nperiod of a month or longer.\r\n\r\n_The tissue changes_ occurring in the disease are inflammation of all or a\r\nfew of the internal organs. Ward states that the most characteristic lesion\r\nof fowl cholera is the severe inflammation of that portion of the small\r\nintestine nearest to the gizzard. Small hemorrhagic spots may be found on\r\nthe heart and other organs.\r\n\r\n_The treatment is both preventive and curative_. The preventive treatment\r\nconsists in quarantining newly purchased birds until we are satisfied that\r\nthey are free from disease. The occasional disinfection of the poultry\r\nhouses and runs is highly important. Cleaning the poultry house by removing\r\nthe floor, roosts, or any part of the house for the purpose of removing all\r\nfilth, and spraying the interior with a three per cent water solution of a\r\ncresol disinfectant, should be practised. Lime should be scattered over the\r\nruns, or the yards immediately about the house. The above preventive\r\nmeasures form an important part of the care and management of the flock.\r\nThe carcasses of the dead birds should be burned. It is advisable to kill\r\nall birds that are fatally sick.\r\n\r\nAll of the flock should be given antiseptics with the feed and water. Four\r\nounces of a water solution of copper sulfate, made by dissolving\r\none-quarter pound of this drug in one gallon of hot water, may be added to\r\neach gallon of drinking water. Frequent disinfection of the drinking\r\nfountains, feeding places and houses should be practised.\r\n\r\nDISEASES RESEMBLING FOWL CHOLERA.--There are a few diseases, such as\r\nsepticaemia, limber neck and infectious enteritis, that are sometimes\r\nmistaken for fowl cholera. These diseases are caused by different\r\nmicroorganisms that may be found in the digestive tract and air-passages of\r\nhealthy birds, insanitary conditions and decomposed feed, especially meat.\r\nIt seems that under certain conditions, such as insanitary quarters and\r\nbirds that are low in constitutional vigor and weakened from other causes,\r\ncertain germs may become disease-producers. The death rate from mixed\r\ninfections is very heavy in poultry.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ vary in the different cases. The disease may be highly\r\nacute, as in limber neck, or chronic, extending over a period of a week or\r\nmore. Diarrhoea is not a prominent symptom in the majority of cases.\r\n\r\nThe post-mortem lesions vary from a hemorrhagic to a chronic inflammation\r\nof the different body organs and serous membranes.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is preventive. A frequent cleaning and disinfecting of the\r\npoultry house and surroundings, avoiding the feeding of spoiled feed, or\r\nallowing the drinking fountains and feeding places to become filthy, are\r\neffective preventive measures. Sick birds should be either isolated and\r\nquarantined, or destroyed. Antiseptics may be given with the feed and\r\ndrinking water.\r\n\r\nAVIAN DIPHTHERIA (ROUP).--This infectious disease of poultry is especially\r\ncommon in chickens. It is characterized by a catarrhal and diphtheritic\r\ninflammation of the mucous membranes of the head.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause of roup_ has not been determined. The disease-producing\r\ngerms are present in the discharges from the nostrils, eyes and mouth, and\r\nthe body excretions of sick birds. Birds having a mild form of roup, or\r\nthat have recently recovered from it, are common carriers of the disease.\r\nThe disease is usually introduced into the flock by allowing birds exposed\r\nat poultry shows, or recently purchased breeding stock from an infected\r\nflock, to mix with the healthy birds.\r\n\r\n_The predisposing causes_ are very important factors in the development of\r\nroup. Cold, damp, draughty, poorly ventilated poultry houses cause the\r\ndisease to spread rapidly and become highly acute.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ differ in character in the different outbreaks of the\r\ndisease. Usually the first symptoms noticed are sneezing, dulness,\r\ndiminished appetite and a watery discharge from the nostrils and eyes.\r\nLater the eyelids may become swollen and the nostrils plugged by the\r\ndischarge from the inflamed membranes. If the mouth is examined at this\r\ntime, an accumulation of mucus and patches of diphtheritic or false\r\nmembranes are found. In the acute form of roup the false membranes and\r\nyellowish, cheesy-like material accumulate on the different mucous\r\nmembranes, and interfere with vision, breathing and digestion. The affected\r\nbird becomes thin and weak. The death rate is very high in this form of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\n_The preventive treatment_ consists in quarantining birds that have been\r\npurchased from other flocks, and that have been exhibited, for a period of\r\nthree weeks. A careful examination of the mouth should be made. If a\r\ncatarrhal discharge from the nostrils and false membranes is present,\r\nprompt treatment should be used. A sick bird should be held in quarantine\r\nfor several weeks after it has recovered, and receive a thorough washing in\r\na two per cent water solution of a cresol disinfectant before allowing it\r\nto mix with the healthy birds.\r\n\r\nThe medicinal treatment consists in removing the discharges from the\r\nnostrils and eyes with pledgets of absorbent cotton that are soaked with a\r\nfour per cent water solution of boric acid. Among the common treatments\r\nmentioned are boric acid and calomel, equal parts by weight, blown into the\r\nnostrils and eyes with a powder blower. Water solutions of boric acid,\r\npotassium permanganate and hydrogen peroxide are recommended. Liquid\r\npreparations are applied with pledgets of cotton, oil cans, or atomizers.\r\n\r\nMany recoveries can be obtained with careful treatment. It is usually most\r\neconomical to kill the severely affected birds. Many poultrymen dispose of\r\nthe entire flock as soon as the disease makes its appearance, and clean and\r\ndisinfect the premises before restocking.\r\n\r\nCHICKENPOX.--In some sections the disease appears in another form, known as\r\n_chickenpox_ (contagious epithelioma), in which nodules form on the skin\r\nalong the base of the comb and other parts of the head, or both forms may\r\nbe met with in the same flock. The nodules should be treated with vaseline,\r\nor glycerine ointments containing two per cent of any of the common\r\nantiseptics or disinfectants.\r\n\r\nENTERO-HEPATITIS. \"BLACKHEAD.\"--This is a very fatal disease of young\r\nturkeys. Grown turkeys and other fowls are not so susceptible to the\r\ndisease. It is characterized by an inflammation of the liver and\r\nintestines, especially the caeca.\r\n\r\n_The specific cause_ is a protozoan microorganism, _Amoeba meleagridis_.\r\nAdult fowls and turkeys may act as carriers of the germ, and the young\r\nturkeys become infected at an early period.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are diminished or lost appetite, dulness, drooped wings,\r\ndiarrhoea, weakness and death. When the disease becomes well advanced, the\r\nhead and comb become dark.\r\n\r\n_The course of the disease_ is from a few weeks to three months. Very few\r\nof the young turkeys survive.\r\n\r\n_The treatment_ is almost entirely preventive. The same precautionary\r\nmeasures for the prevention of the introduction of disease into the flock,\r\nrecommended in other infectious diseases, should be practised. Turkeys that\r\nsurvive should be disposed of. As chickens may harbor the disease-producing\r\ngerms, we should not attempt to raise turkeys in the same quarters with\r\nthem. Eggs should be obtained from disease-free flocks. Wiping the eggs\r\nwith a cloth wet with fifty per cent alcohol may be practised. The same\r\nrecommendations regarding the cleaning and disinfecting of the quarters\r\ndescribed in the treatment of fowl cholera should be practised.\r\n\r\nIf an outbreak of the disease occurs in the flock all of the sick birds\r\nshould be killed, and their carcasses cremated. Moving the flock to fresh\r\nruns and the administration of intestinal antiseptics are the only\r\neffective lines of treatment.\r\n\r\nAVIAN TUBERCULOSIS.--Tuberculosis of poultry is a serious disease in some\r\ncountries. Poultry usually contract tuberculosis by contact with a\r\ntubercular bird, and not from other domestic animals and man.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms_ are of a general character, such as emaciation, weakness,\r\nwasting of muscles and lameness. Tubercular growths may appear on the\r\nsurface of the body.\r\n\r\nIf we suspect the presence of the disease, it is advisable to kill one of\r\nthe sick birds and make a careful examination. The finding of yellowish,\r\nwhite, cheesy nodules or masses in the liver, spleen, intestines and\r\nmesenteries is strong evidence of tuberculosis. A bacteriological\r\nexamination of the tissues may be necessary in order to confirm the\r\ndiagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe same _methods of treatment_ as recommended in tuberculosis of other\r\ndomestic animals may be used in eliminating the disease from the premises\r\nand flock. This consists in killing and cremating all birds showing visible\r\nsymptoms, moving the apparently healthy portion of the flock to new\r\nquarters and wiping the eggs with alcohol. The old quarters should be\r\ncleaned, disinfected, and then allowed to stand empty for several months,\r\nwhen we should again spray with a disinfectant, and scatter lime over the\r\nruns. If the cleaning and disinfecting have been thorough, we may safely\r\nturn young or healthy birds into the old quarters. All possible precautions\r\nagainst carrying the infection to the healthy flock must be observed.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. Give the cause and treatment for fowl cholera.\r\n\r\n2.
