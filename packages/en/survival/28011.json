Again and again I have undertaken the work, only to lay it\r\naside because I felt the need of greater experience and wider knowledge.\r\nI do not now feel that this deficiency has been by any means fully\r\nsupplied, but in some directions it has been removed through the\r\nkindness of Dr. F. H. Chittenden of the Bureau of Entomology, who wrote\r\nthe chapter on insect enemies, and of W. A. Orton of the Bureau of Plant\r\nIndustry, United States Department of Agriculture, who wrote the chapter\r\non diseases of tomatoes.\r\n\r\nI have made free use of, without special credit, and am largely indebted\r\nto, the writings of Doctor Sturtevant and Professor Goff, Professor\r\nMunson of Maine, Professor Halsted of New Jersey, Professor Corbett of\r\nWashington, Professor Rolfs of Florida, Professor Bailey of New York,\r\nProfessor Green of Ohio, and many others. I have also found a vast\r\namount of valuable information in the agricultural press of this country\r\nin general. I am also indebted to L. B. Coulter and Prof. W. G. Johnson\r\nfor many photographs. My thanks are also due B. F. Williamson, who made\r\nthe excellent drawings for this book under Professor Johnson's\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nTomatoes are among the most generally used and popular vegetables. They\r\nare grown not only in gardens, but in large areas in every state from\r\nMaine to California and Washington to Florida, and under very different\r\nconditions of climate, soil and cultural facilities, as well as of\r\nrequirements as to character of fruit. The methods which will give the\r\nbest results under one set of conditions are entirely unsuited to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nI have tried to give the nature and requirements of the plant and the\r\neffect of conditions as seen in my own experience, a knowledge of which\r\nmay enable the reader to follow the methods most suited to his own\r\nconditions and requirements, rather than to recommend the exact methods\r\nwhich have given me the best results.\r\n\r\nWILL W.

The name from _lykos_, a\r\nwolf, and _persica_, a peach, is given it because of the supposed\r\naphrodisiacal qualities, and the beauty of the fruit. The genus\r\ncomprises a few species of South American annual or short-lived\r\nperennial, herbaceous, rank-smelling plants in which the many branches\r\nare spreading, procumbent, or feebly ascendent and commonly 2 to 6 feet\r\nin length, though under some conditions, particularly in the South and\r\nin California, they grow much longer. They are covered with resinous\r\nviscid secretions and are round, soft, brittle and hairy, when young,\r\nbut become furrowed, angular, hard and almost woody with enlarged\r\njoints, when old. The leaves are irregularly alternate, 5 to 15 inches\r\nlong, petioled, odd pinnate, with seven to nine short-stemmed leaflets,\r\noften with much smaller and stemless ones between them. The larger\r\nleaflets are sometimes entire, but more generally notched, cut, or even\r\ndivided, particularly at the base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2--TOMATO FLOWERS ENLARGED ABOUT 2-1/2 TIMES.\r\nSECTION OF FLOWER SHOWN AT RIGHT (Drawn from a photograph by courtesy of\r\nProf. L. C. Corbett)]\r\n\r\n=The flowers= are pendant and borne in more or less branched clusters,\r\nlocated on the stem on the opposite side and usually a little below the\r\nleaves; the first cluster on the sixth to twelfth internode from the\r\nground, with one on each second to sixth succeeding one. The flowers\r\n(Fig. 2) are small, consisting of a yellow, deeply five-cleft,\r\nwheel-shaped corolla, with a very short tube and broadly lanceolate,\r\nrecurving petals. The calyx consists of five long linear or lanceolate\r\nsepals, which are shorter than the petals at first, but are persistent,\r\nand increase in size as the fruits mature. The stamens, five in number,\r\nare borne on the throat of the corolla, and consist of long, large\r\nanthers, borne on short filaments, loosely joined into a tube and\r\nopening by a longitudinal slit on the inside, and this is the chief\r\nbotanical distinction between this genus and _Solanum_ to which the\r\npotato, pepper, night shade and tobacco belong. The anthers in the\r\nlatter genus open at the tip only. The two genera, however, are closely\r\nrelated and plants belonging to them are readily united by grafting. The\r\nPhysalis, Husk tomato or Ground cherry is quite distinct, botanically.\r\nThe pistils of the true tomato are short at first, but the style\r\nelongates so as to push the capitate stigma through the tube formed by\r\nthe anthers, this usually occurring before the anthers open for the\r\ndischarge of the pollen. The fruit is a two to many-celled berry with\r\ncentral fleshy placenta and many small kidney-shaped seeds which are\r\ndensely covered with short, stiff hairs, as seen in Figs. 3 and 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3--TWO-CELLED TOMATO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4--THREE-CELLED TOMATO]\r\n\r\nIt is comparatively easy to define the genus with which the tomato\r\nshould be classed botanically, but it is by no means so easy to classify\r\nour cultivated varieties into botanical species. We have in cultivation\r\nvarieties which are known to have originated in gardens and from the\r\nsame parentage, but which differ from each other so much in habit of\r\ngrowth, character of leaf and fruit and other respects, that if they had\r\nbeen found growing wild they would unhesitatingly be pronounced\r\ndifferent species, and botanists are not agreed as to how our many and\r\nvery different garden varieties should be classified botanically. Some\r\ncontend that all of our cultivated sorts are varieties of but two\r\ndistinct species, while others think they have originated from several.\r\n\r\n=Classification.=--The author suggests the following classification,\r\ndiffering somewhat from that sometimes given, as he believes that the\r\nlarge, deep-sutured fruit of our cultivated varieties and the distinct\r\npear-shaped sorts come from original species rather than from variations\r\nof _Lycopersicum cerasiforme_:\r\n\r\n=Currant tomato, Grape tomato, German or Raisin tomato= (_Lycopersicum\r\npimpinellifolium_, _L. racemiforme_) (Fig. 5).--Universally regarded as\r\na distinct species. Plant strong, growing with many long, slender, weak\r\nbranches which are not so hairy, viscid, or ill-smelling, and never\r\nbecome so hard or woody as those of the other species. The numerous\r\nleaves are very bright green in color, leaflets small, nearly entire,\r\nwith many small stemless ones between the others. Fruit produced\r\ncontinuously and in great quantity on long racemes like those of the\r\ncurrant, though they are often branched. They continue to elongate and\r\nblossom until the fruit at the upper end is fully ripened. Fruit small,\r\nless than 1/2 inch in diameter, spherical, smooth and of a particularly\r\nbright, beautiful red color which contrasts well with the bright green\r\nleaves, and this abundance of beautifully colored and gracefully poised\r\nfruit makes the plant worthy of more general cultivation as an ornament,\r\nthough the fruit is of little value for culinary use. This species, when\r\npure, has not varied under cultivation, but it readily crosses with\r\nother species and with our garden varieties, and many of these owe their\r\nbright red color to the influence of crosses with the above species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5--CURRANT TOMATO AND CHARACTERISTIC CLUSTERS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6--RED CHERRY TOMATO]\r\n\r\n=Cherry tomato= (_L. cerasiforme_) (Fig. 6).--Plant vigorous, with stout\r\nbranches which are distinctly trailing in habit. Leaves flat or but\r\nslightly curled. Fruit very abundant, borne in short, branched\r\nclusters, globular, perfectly smooth, with no apparent sutures. From 1/2\r\nto 3/4 inch in diameter and either red or yellow in color, two-celled\r\nwith numerous comparatively small, kidney-shaped seeds. Many of our\r\ngarden varieties show evidence of crosses with this species, and by many\r\nit is regarded as the original wild form of all of our cultivated sorts.\r\nThese, when they escape from cultivation and become wild plants, as they\r\noften do, from New Jersey southward, produce fruit which, in many\r\nrespects, resembles that of this species in size and form; but they are\r\ngenerally more flattened, globe-shaped, with more or less distinct\r\nsutures on the upper side, and I have never seen any fruit of these wild\r\nplants which could not be readily distinguished from that of the true\r\nCherry tomato.\r\n\r\nProf. P. H. Rolfs, Director of the Florida experiment station, reports\r\nthat among the millions of volunteer, or wild, tomatoes he has seen\r\ngrowing in the abandoned tomato fields in Florida, he has never seen a\r\nplant with fruit which could not be easily distinguished from that of\r\nthe true Cherry tomato. Again, one can, by selection and cultivation,\r\neasily develop from these wild forms plants producing fruit as large and\r\noften practically identical with that of our cultivated varieties, while\r\nI have given a true stock of Cherry tomato most careful cultivation on\r\nthe best of soil for 20 consecutive generations without any increase in\r\nsize or change in character of the fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7--PEAR-SHAPED TOMATO]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8--YELLOW PLUM TOMATO, SHOWING MOST USUAL FORM OF\r\nCLUSTER]\r\n\r\n=Pear (not Plum) tomato= (_L. pyriforme_) (Fig. 7).--Plant exceptionally\r\nvigorous, with comparatively few long, stout stems inclined to ascend.\r\nLeaves numerous, broad, flat, with a distinct bluish-green color\r\nnoticeable, even in the cotyledons. Fruit abundant, borne in short\r\nbranched or straight clusters of five to ten fruits. It is perfectly\r\nsmooth, without sutures, and of the shape of a long, slender-necked\r\npear, not over an inch in transverse by 1-1/2 inches in longitudinal\r\ndiameter. When the stock is pure the fruit retains this form very\r\npersistently. The production of egg-shaped or other forms is a sure\r\nindication of impure stock. They are bright red, dark yellow, or light\r\nyellowish white in color, two-celled, with very distinct central\r\nplacenta and comparatively few and large seeds. The fruit is inclined to\r\nripen unevenly, the neck remaining green when the rest of the fruit is\r\nquite ripe. It is less juicy than that of most of our garden sorts but\r\nof a mild and pleasant flavor. This is considered, by many, to be\r\nsimply a garden variety, but I am inclined to the belief that it is a\r\ndistinct species and that the contrary view comes from the study of the\r\nimpure and crossed stocks resulting from crosses between the true Pear\r\ntomato and garden sorts which are frequently sold by seedsmen as\r\npear-shaped. Many garden sorts--like the Plum (Fig. 8), the Egg, the\r\nGolden Nugget, Vick's Criterion, etc.--are known to have originated from\r\ncrosses of the Pear and I think that most, if not all, the garden sorts\r\nin which the longitudinal diameter of the fruit is greater than its\r\ntransverse diameter owe this form to crosses with _L. pyriforme_.\r\n\r\n=Cultivated varieties= (_L. esculentum_).--This is commonly used as the\r\nbotanical name of our cultivated varieties, rather than as the name of a\r\ndistinct species. In western South America, however, there is found\r\ngrowing a wild plant of Lycopersicum which differs from the other\r\nrecognized species in being more compact in growth, with fewer branches\r\nand larger leaves, and carrying an immense burden of fruit borne in\r\nlarge clusters. The fruit is larger than that of the other species but\r\nmuch smaller than that of our cultivated sorts; is very irregular in\r\nshape, always with distinct sutures, and often deeply corrugated and\r\nbright red in color. The walls are thin; the flesh is soft, with a\r\ndistinct sharp, acid flavor much less agreeable than that of our\r\ncultivated forms of garden tomatoes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9--ONE OF THE FIRST ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE TOMATO\r\n_Poma amoris_, (_Pomum aureum_), (_Lycopersicum_), 1581]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10--AN EARLY ILLUSTRATION OF THE TOMATO (From\r\nMorrison's \"Historia Universalis,\" 1680)]\r\n\r\nThis has commonly been regarded by botanists as a degenerate form of our\r\ngarden tomatoes, rather than as an original species, but I find that,\r\nlike _L. cerasiforme_ and _L. pyriforme_, it is quite fixed under\r\ncultivation, except as crossed with other species or with our garden\r\nvarieties, and I believe it to be the original species from which our\r\ncultured sorts have been developed, by crossing and selection. Such\r\ncrosses probably were made either naturally or by natives before the\r\ntomato was discovered by Europeans. The earliest prints we have of the\r\ntomato (Figs. 9 and 10) are far more like the fruit of this plant than\r\nthat of _L. cerasiforme_, and the prints of many of the earliest garden\r\nvarieties and of some sorts which are still cultivated in southern\r\nEurope, for use in soups, are like it not only in size and form, but in\r\nflavor. These facts make it seem far more probable that our cultivated\r\nsorts have come, by crossing, between this and other species rather than\r\nby simple development from _L. cerasiforme_.\r\n\r\nProf. E. S. Goff, of Wisconsin, who has made a most careful study of the\r\ntomato, expressed the same opinion, writing that it seemed to him that\r\nour cultivated sorts must have come from the crossing of a small, round,\r\nsmooth, sutureless type, with a larger, deep-sutured, corrugated fruit,\r\nlike that of the Mammoth Chihuahua, but smaller. However this may be, I\r\nthink that it is wise to throw all of our cultivated garden sorts,\r\nexcept the Pear, the Cherry, and the Grape--which I regard as distinct\r\nspecies--together under the name of _L. esculentum_, even when we know\r\nthey have originated by direct crosses with the other species; and it is\r\nwell to classify the upright growing sorts under the varietal names, _L.\r\nvalidum_, and the larger, heavier sorts, as _L. grandifolium_, as has\r\nbeen done by Bailey. (Cyclopedia of Horticulture.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHistory\r\n\r\n\r\nThe garden vegetable known in this country as tomato and generally as\r\ntomate in continental Europe, is also known as Wolf-peach and Love Apple\r\nin England and America, and Liebesapfel in Germany, Pomme d'Amour in\r\nFrance, Pomo d'oro in Italy, Pomidor in Poland.\r\n\r\n=Origin of name.=--The name tomato is of South American origin, and is\r\nderived from the Aztec word _xitomate_, or _zitotomate_, which is given\r\nthe fruit of both the Common tomato and that of the Husk or Strawberry\r\ntomato or Physalis. Both vegetables were highly prized and extensively\r\ncultivated by the natives long before the discovery of the country by\r\nEuropeans, and there is little doubt that many of the plants first seen\r\nand described by Europeans as wild species were really garden varieties\r\noriginated with the native Americans by the variation or crossing of the\r\noriginal wild species.\r\n\r\n=Different types now common=, according to Sturtevant, have become known\r\nto, and been described by Europeans in about the following order:\r\n\r\n     1. Large yellow, described by Matthiolus in 1554 and called\r\n        Golden apple.\r\n\r\n     2. Large red, described by Matthiolus in 1554 and called Love\r\n        apple.\r\n\r\n     3. Purple red, described by D'el Obel in 1570.\r\n\r\n     4. White-fleshed, described by Dodoens in 1586.\r\n\r\n     5. Red cherry, described by Bauhin in 1620.\r\n\r\n     6. Yellow cherry, described by Bauhin in 1620.\r\n\r\n     7. Ochre yellow, described by Bauhin in 1651.\r\n\r\n     8. Striped, blotched or visi-colored, described by Bauhin in\r\n        1651.\r\n\r\n     9. Pale red, described by Tournefort in 1700.\r\n\r\n    10. Large smooth, or ribless red, described by Tournefort in\r\n        1700.\r\n\r\n    11. Bronzed-leaved, described by Blacknell in 1750.\r\n\r\n    12. Deep orange, described by Bryant in 1783.\r\n\r\n    13. Pear-shaped, described by Dunal in 1805.\r\n\r\n    14. Tree tomato, described by Vilmorin in 1855.\r\n\r\n    15. Broad-leaved, introduced about 1860.\r\n\r\nThe special description of No. 10 by Tournefort in 1700 would indicate\r\nthat large smooth sorts, like Livingston's Stone, were in existence\r\nfully 200 years ago, instead of being modern improvements, as is\r\nsometimes claimed; and a careful study of old descriptions and cuts and\r\ncomparing them with the best examples of modern varieties led Doctor\r\nSturtevant in 1889 to express the opinion that they had fruit as large\r\nand smooth as those we now grow, before the tomato came into general use\r\nin America, and possibly before the fruit was generally known to\r\nEuropeans. Even the production of fine fruit under glass is not so\r\nmodern as many suppose. In transactions of the London Horticultural\r\nSociety for 1820, John Wilmot is reported to have cultivated under glass\r\nin 1818 some 600 plants and gathered from his entire plantings under\r\nglass and in borders some 130 bushels of ripe fruit. It is stated that\r\nthe growth that year exceeded the demand, and that the fruit obtained\r\nwas of extraordinary size, some exceeding 12 inches in circumference and\r\nweighing 12 ounces each. Thomas Meehan states in _Gardeners' Monthly_\r\nfor February, 1880, that on January 8, of that year, he saw growing in\r\nthe greenhouses on Senator Cannon's place near Harrisburg, Pa., at\r\nleast 1 bushel of ripe fruits, none of which were less than 10 inches in\r\ncircumference,--a showing which compares with the best to be seen\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nThroughout southern Europe the value of the fruit for use in soups and\r\nas a salad seems to have been at once recognized, and it came into quite\r\ngeneral use, especially in Spain and Italy, during the 17th century; but\r\nin northern Europe and England, though the plant was grown in botanical\r\ngardens and in a few private places as a curiosity and for the beauty of\r\nits fruit, this was seldom eaten, being commonly regarded as unhealthy\r\nand even poisonous, and on this account, and probably because of its\r\nsupposed aphrodisiacal qualities, it did not come into general use in\r\nthose northern countries until early in the 19th century.\r\n\r\n=First mention= in America, I find of its being grown for culinary use,\r\nwas in Virginia in 1781. In 1788 a Frenchman in Philadelphia made most\r\nearnest efforts to get people to use the fruit, but with little success,\r\nand similar efforts by an Italian in Salem, Mass., in 1802, were no more\r\nsuccessful. The first record I can find of the fruit being regularly\r\nquoted in the market was in New Orleans in 1812, and the earliest\r\nrecords I have been able to find of the seed being offered by seedsmen,\r\nas that of an edible vegetable, was by Gardener and Hipburn in 1818, and\r\nby Landreth in 1820. Buist's \"Kitchen Gardener\" says: \"In 1828-9 it (the\r\ntomato) was almost detested and commonly considered poisonous. Ten years\r\nlater every variety of pill and panacea was 'extract of tomatoes,' and\r\nnow (1847) almost as much ground is devoted to its culture as to the\r\ncabbage.\" In 1834 Professor Dunglison, of the University of Virginia,\r\nsaid: \"The tomato may be looked upon as one of the most wholesome and\r\nvaluable esculents of the garden.\"\r\n\r\nYet, though the fruit has always received similar commendation from\r\nmedical men, there has been constant recurring superstition that it is\r\nunhealthy. Only a few years ago there was in general circulation a\r\nstatement that an eminent physician had discovered that eating tomatoes\r\ntended to develop cancer. This has been definitely traced to the playful\r\nquestion, asked as a joke by Dr. Dio Lewis, \"Didn't you know that eating\r\nbright red tomatoes caused cancer?\" In more recent years an equally\r\nunfounded claim has been made that tomato seeds were responsible for\r\nmany cases of appendicitis and that it was consequently dangerous to eat\r\nthe fruit.\r\n\r\nI give some quotations for tomatoes in Quincy Hall Market, Boston, with\r\nsome for other vegetables, for comparison. The records show that during\r\nthe week ending July 22, 1835, tomatoes were quoted at 50 cents per\r\ndozen, cabbage at 50 cents per dozen. For the week ending September 22,\r\n1835, tomatoes were quoted at 25 cents per peck, lima beans, 12-1/2\r\ncents per quart shelled, with comment that tomatoes are in much demand\r\nand a far greater quantity has been sold than in previous years. During\r\nthe week ending July 22, 1837, tomatoes were quoted at 25 and 50 cents\r\nper peck, and the note that they are of good size and were well ripened\r\nand came from gardens in the vicinity would indicate that they had at\r\nthat time early maturing varieties and knew how to grow them. From about\r\n1835 till the present time the cultivation and use of tomatoes have\r\nconstantly increased both in this country and in Europe, so that now\r\nthey are one of the most largely grown of our garden vegetables.\r\n\r\nA suggestion as to the extent they are now grown in America is the fact\r\nthat a single seed grower saved in 1903 over 20,000 pounds of tomato\r\nseed--an amount sufficient to furnish plants for from 80,000 to 320,000\r\nacres, according to the care used in raising them, the larger quantity\r\nnot requiring more care than the best growers commonly use. A careful\r\nestimate made by the _American Grocer_ shows that in 1903 the packing of\r\ntomatoes by canners in the United States amounted to 246,775,426\r\nthree-pound cans. In addition to the canned tomato, between 200,000 and\r\n250,000 barrels of catsup stock is put up annually, requiring the\r\nproduct of at least 20,000 acres.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the area required to produce the fruit that is used\r\nfresh at least equals that devoted to the production for preserving,\r\nwhich give us from 400,000 to 500,000 acres devoted to this crop each\r\nyear in America alone. The fruit is perhaps in more general use in\r\nAmerica than elsewhere, but its cultivation and use have increased\r\nrapidly in other countries, particularly with the English speaking\r\nraces. Large quantities are grown in Australia, and immense and\r\nconstantly increasing quantities are grown under glass in England and\r\nadjacent islands, while _The Gardeners' Chronicle_ states that in 1903\r\nbetween 600,000 and 800,000 pounds of fresh fruit were imported into\r\nEngland from other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nGeneral Characteristics of the Plant\r\n\r\n\r\n=In the native home= of the tomato, in South America, the conditions of\r\nthe soil, both as regards composition and mechanical condition, of the\r\nmoisture both in soil and air, and those of temperature and sunlight,\r\nare throughout the growing season not only very favorable for rapid\r\ngrowth, but are uniformly and constantly so. Under such conditions there\r\nhas been developed a plant which, while vigorous, tenacious of life,\r\ncapable of rapid growth and enormously productive, is not at all hardy\r\nin the sense of ability to endure untoward conditions either in the\r\ncharacter of soil, of water supply, or of temperature. A check in the\r\ndevelopment because of any unfavorable condition is never fully\r\nrecovered from, but will inevitably affect the total quantity and\r\nquality of the fruit produced, even if subsequent favorable conditions\r\nresult in the rapid and vigorous growth of the plant.\r\n\r\nI know of an instance where two adjoining fields belonging to A and B\r\nwere set with tomatoes, using plants started in the same hotbed from the\r\nsame lot of seed. The soil was of equal natural fertility and each field\r\nreceived about the same quantity of manure, though that given A's was\r\nall well decomposed and worked into the soil, while that given B's was\r\nfresh and raw and simply plowed in. A's field was put into the best\r\npossible tilth before setting the plants, and the management of the\r\nplants and their cultivation were such as to secure unchecked growth\r\nfrom the time they were pricked out into cold-frames and set in the\r\nfield until the crop was matured. As long as the plants would permit,\r\nthe soil was cultivated every few days and kept in a state of perfect\r\ntilth.\r\n\r\nB's field when the plants were set out was a mass of clods, as it had\r\nbeen plowed, when wet, some time before and never harrowed but once.\r\nThe plants had been crowded forward as rapidly as possible in the\r\ncold-frame, and when set in the field were much higher than A's, but so\r\nsoft that they were badly checked in transplanting and a great many of\r\nthem died and had to be reset. The field received but one or two\r\ncultivations during the entire season. The growth of the plants in B's\r\nfield was irregular and uneven instead of steady and uniform as in A's,\r\nand though some of the fruits were quite as large, they were not as\r\nuniform as A's while the yield per acre was not more than half as much\r\nnor the fruit of as good general quality. B had difficulty in disposing\r\nof his crop and often had to sell below the market, while A had no\r\ntrouble in disposing of his at the highest prices for the day. B's crop\r\nwas a financial loss, while A's returned a most satisfactory profit.\r\n\r\nThe key to the most successful culture of the tomato is the securing,\r\nfrom the start to finish, of an unchecked uniform growth, though it need\r\nnot necessarily be a rapid one. The failure to do this is, in my\r\nopinion, the principal reason for the comparatively small yield usually\r\nobtained, which is very much less than it would be with better cultural\r\nmanagement. The tomato under conditions which I have repeatedly found it\r\npracticable to secure, not only in small plantings but in large fields,\r\nhas proved capable of producing from 1,000 to 1,200 or even more bushels\r\nto the acre, and the possible yield per plant is enormous.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1818 the Royal Horticultural Society of London reports the\r\nobtaining of over 40 pounds of fruit of marketable character from a\r\nsingle vine. An acre of such plants would give a yield of over 1,800\r\nbushels of fruit, and many similar yields, and even greater ones, have\r\nbeen recorded for single plants. The yield commonly obtained, even in\r\nfavorable locations, and by men who have grown tomatoes all their lives,\r\nis more often less than 200 bushels to the acre than more. The way to\r\nsecure a better yield is to study carefully the nature and requirements\r\nof the plants and the adaptation of our cultural practice to them.\r\n\r\n=Life habit of the plant.=--The tomato could be described as a\r\nshort-lived perennial, but its span of life is somewhat variable. Under\r\nfavorable conditions it will develop from starting seed to first ripe\r\nfruit in from 85 to 120 days of full sunshine with a constant day\r\ntemperature of from 75 to 90° F., and with one from 15 to 20° F. lower\r\nat night. The plants will ordinarily continue in full fruit for about 50\r\nto 60 days, after which they generally become so exhausted by excessive\r\nproduction of fruit and the effects of diseases to which they are\r\nusually subject that their root action and sap circulation become weaker\r\nand weaker until they die from starvation. From Philadelphia southward\r\ngardeners expect that spring set plants will thus exhaust themselves and\r\ndie by late summer, and they sow seed in late spring or early summer for\r\nplants on which they depend for late summer and fall crops.\r\n\r\nUnder some conditions, particularly in the Gulf states and in\r\nCalifornia, tomato plants will not only grow to a much greater size than\r\nnormal, but will continue to thrive and bear fruit for a longer time.\r\nSuch a plant grown in Pasadena, Cal., was said to have been in constant\r\nbearing for over 10 months. Again, sometimes plants that have produced a\r\nfull crop of fruits will start new sets of roots and leaves and produce\r\na second and even a third crop, each, however, being produced on new\r\nbranches and as a result of a fresh set of roots, those which produced\r\nthe preceding crop having died and disappeared. The period of\r\ndevelopment, 85 to 120 days of full sunshine at a temperature above 75°\r\nF., has been given. The full sunshine and high temperature are essential\r\nto such rapid development, and in so far as there is a lack of sunshine\r\nfrom clouds or shade, or the day temperature falls below 75° F. the\r\nperiod will be lengthened, so that in the greater part of the United\r\nStates the elapsed time between starting seed to ripened fruit is\r\nusually as much as from 120 to 150 days and often even longer.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of the root.=--The roots of the tomato plant, while\r\nabundant in number, are short and can only gather food and water from a\r\nlimited area. A plant of garden bean, for instance, is not more than\r\nhalf the size of one of the tomato, but its roots extend through the\r\nsoil to a greater distance, gather plant food from a greater bulk of\r\nsoil, seem better able to search out and gather the particular food\r\nelement which the plant needs than do those of the tomato. This\r\ncharacteristic of the latter plant makes the composition of the soil as\r\nto the proportion of easily available food elements of great importance.\r\nTomato roots are also exceedingly tender and incapable of penetrating a\r\nhard and compact soil, so that the condition of the soil as to tilth is\r\nof greater importance with regard to tomatoes than with most garden\r\nvegetables.\r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of the tomato roots is that the period of their\r\nactive life is short. When young they are capable of transmitting water\r\nand nutritive material very rapidly, but they soon become clogged and\r\ninefficient to such an extent as to result in the starvation and death\r\nof the plant. If the branches of such an exhausted plant be bent over\r\nand covered with earth they will frequently start new roots and produce\r\na fresh crop of fruit, or if plants which have made a crop in the\r\ngreenhouse be transplanted to the garden and cut back, a new set of\r\nroots will often develop and the plant will produce a second crop of\r\nfruit which, in amount, often equals or exceeds the first one. But such\r\ngrowths come only from new roots springing from the stem--never from an\r\nextension of the old root system.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of the stem and leaves.=--The growth of the stem, and\r\nleaves of the young tomato plant is very rapid and, the cellular\r\nstructure coarse, loose and open. A young branch is easily broken and\r\nwhen this is done it shows scarcely any fibrous structure--simply a mass\r\nof coarse cellular matter which while capable, when young, of\r\ntransmitting nutritive matter rapidly, soon becomes dogged and inert.\r\nThis structure not only makes the active life of the leaves short, like\r\nthat of the roots, but necessitates a fresh growth in order to continue\r\nthe fruitfulness of the plant and renders the leaves very susceptible to\r\ninjury from bacterial and fungous diseases. The rapid growth also\r\nnecessitates an abundance of sunlight.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of the blossom.=--The inflorescence of the tomato is\r\nusually abundant and it is rare that a plant does not produce sufficient\r\nblooms for a full crop. The flowers are perfect as far as parts are\r\nconcerned (Fig. 2) and in bright, sunny weather there is an abundance of\r\npollen, but sunlight and warmth are essential to its maturing into a\r\ncondition in which it can easily reach the stigma. The structure and\r\ndevelopment of the flower are such that while occasionally, particularly\r\nin healthy plants out of doors, the stigma becomes receptive and takes\r\nthe pollen as it is pushed out through the stamen tube by the elongating\r\nstyle, it is more often pushed beyond them before the pollen matures, so\r\nthat the pollen has to reach the stigma through some other means.\r\nUsually this is accomplished by the wind, either directly or through the\r\nmotion of the plants.\r\n\r\nUnder glass it is generally necessary to assist the fertilization either\r\ndirectly by application or by motion of the plant, this latter only\r\nbeing effective in the middle of a bright sunny day. In the open ground\r\nin cold, damp weather the flowers often fail of fertilization, in which\r\ncase they drop, and this is often the first indication of a failing of\r\nthe crop on large, strong vines. I have known of many cases where the\r\nyield of fruit from large and seemingly very healthy vines was very\r\nlight because continual rains prevented the pollenization of the\r\nflowers. Such failures, however, do not always come from a want of\r\npollen but may result from an over or irregular supply of water either\r\nat the root or in the air, imperfectly balanced food supply, a sapping\r\nof the vitality of the plants when young, or from other causes. Insects\r\nrarely visit tomato flowers and are seldom the means of their\r\nfertilization.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics of the fruit.=--The fruit of the original species from\r\nwhich our cultivated tomatoes have developed was doubtless a\r\ncomparatively small two to many-celled berry, with comparatively dry\r\ncentral placenta and thin walls. In some species the cells were\r\nindicated by distinct sutures, forming a rough or corrugated fruit. It\r\nhas improved under cultivation by increase in size, the material\r\nthickening of the cell walls, the development of greater juiciness and\r\nricher flavor and a decrease in the size and dryness of the placenta, as\r\nwell as the breaking up of the cells by fleshy partitions resulting in\r\nthe disappearance of the deep sutures and an improvement in the\r\nsmoothness and beauty of the fruit. (Fig. 11.)\r\n\r\nThe quality of the fruit is largely dependent upon varietal differences,\r\nto be spoken of later, but it is also influenced by conditions of\r\ngrowth--such as the proportion of the nutritive elements found in the\r\nsoil, the proper supply of moisture, the degree and uniformity of\r\ntemperature and, most of all, the amount of sunlight. Sudden changes of\r\ntemperature and moisture often result in cracks and fissures in the skin\r\nand flesh, which not only injure the appearance but affect the flavor of\r\nthe fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11--TYPICAL BUNCH OF MODERN TOMATOES Contrast with\r\nFigs. 9 and 10]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nEssentials for Development\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sunlight.=--Abundant and unobstructed sunlight is the most essential\r\ncondition for the healthy growth of the tomato. It is a native of the\r\nsunny South and will not thrive except in full and abundant sunlight. I\r\nhave never been able to grow good tomatoes in the shade even where it is\r\nonly partial. The entire plant needs the sunlight. The blossoms often\r\nfail to set and the fruit is lacking in flavor because of shade, from\r\nexcessive leaf growth, or other obstruction.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty in winter forcing tomatoes under glass in the North\r\ncomes from the want of sunlight during the short days of the winter\r\nmonths. Were it not for the short winter days of the higher latitudes\r\nlimiting the hours of sunshine, tomatoes could be grown under glass in\r\nthe northern states to compete in price, when the better quality of\r\nvine-ripened fruits is considered, with those from the Gulf states.\r\nGrowers are learning that tomatoes can be profitably grown under glass\r\nduring the longer spring days, and consumers are beginning to appreciate\r\nthe superior quality of fruit ripened on the vine over that picked green\r\nand ripened in transit. At no time is this need of abundance of light of\r\ngreater importance than when the plants are young and, if they fail to\r\nreceive it, no subsequent favorable conditions will enable them to\r\nrecover fully from its ill effects. It is not so much the want of room\r\nfor the roots as of light for the leaves that makes the plants which\r\nhave been crowded in the seed-beds so weak and unprofitable.\r\n\r\nI once divided 100 young tomato plants, about 2 inches high, into four\r\nlots of 25 each, numbering them 1, 2, 3 and 4. The plants of lots No. 1\r\nand 2 were set equal distance apart in box A, and those of lots No. 3\r\nand 4 in the same way in box B; both boxes being about 16 inches wide,\r\n40 inches long and 4 inches deep. The two boxes were set together across\r\nthe side bench of a greenhouse with the outer edge against a board wall\r\nsome 2-1/2 feet high, so that the plants at the end of the box near the\r\nwall received much less light than those at the other end. They remained\r\nthere about five weeks and then were taken out and the plants set in the\r\nopen ground. During the five weeks box A, containing lots No. 1 and 2,\r\nwas changed, end for end, every day so that those two lots of plants\r\nreceived nearly an equal amount of sunlight, but box B was not changed\r\nso that lot No. 3, at one end of the box, was constantly near the walk\r\nand in the full light, while lot No. 4, at the other end of the box, was\r\nconstantly near the wall and in partial shade. The effect on the growth\r\nof the plants was very marked. The plants of lot No. 4 were nearly twice\r\nas high, but with much softer stems and leaves than those of lot No. 3.\r\nThe plants received equal care when set side by side in the open ground\r\nand at the time the first fruit was gathered seemed of equal size and\r\nvigor, but the total yield of fruit of lots No. 1, 2 and 3 was very\r\nnearly the same and in each case at the rate of over 100 bushels an acre\r\nmore than that from lot No. 4. This is but one of the scores of\r\nexperiences which have led me to appreciate, in some degree, the\r\nnecessity of plenty of sunlight for the best development of the tomato.\r\n\r\n=Heat.=--The plant thrives best out of doors in a dry temperature of 75\r\nto 85° F., or even up to 95° F., if the air is not too dry and is in\r\ngentle circulation. The rate of growth diminishes as the temperature\r\nfalls below 75° until at 50° there is practically no growth; the plant\r\nis simply living at a poor dying rate and if the growth, particularly in\r\nyoung plants, is checked in this way for any considerable time they will\r\nnever produce a full crop of fruit, even if the plants reach full size\r\nand are seemingly vigorous and healthy. The plant is generally killed by\r\nexposure for even a short time to freezing temperature, though young\r\nvolunteer plants in the spring are frequently so hardened by exposure\r\nthat they will survive a frost that crusts the ground they stand in; but\r\nsuch exposure affects the productiveness of the plant, even if it\r\nsubsequently makes a seemingly vigorous and healthy growth. Under glass,\r\nplants usually do best in a temperature somewhat lower than is most\r\ndesirable out of doors. I think this is due to the inevitable\r\nobstruction of the sunlight and the lack of perfect ventilation.\r\n\r\n=Moisture.=--Although the tomato is not a desert plant and needs a\r\nplentiful supply of water, it suffers far more frequently, particularly\r\nwhen the plants are young, from an over-supply than from the want of\r\nwater. Good drainage at the root and warm, dry, sunny air, in gentle\r\nmotion, are what it delights in. Good drainage is essential not only to\r\nthe best growth of the plant but to the production of any fruit of good\r\nquality. So important is this feature that though it can be readily\r\nproved that, other things being equal, the tomato will give larger yield\r\nand better fruit on well drained clay loam than on sandy soil, yet it is\r\nmore generally and more successfully planted on sandy lands simply\r\nbecause they are usually better drained and on this account give better\r\ncrops. While excess of water in the soil is most injurious to the young\r\nand growing plant, an abundance of it at the time the fruit swells and\r\nripens is very essential, and a want of it at that time results in small\r\nand imperfect fruit of poor flavor. Excessive moisture in the air is\r\njust as injurious as at the root. In my personal experience I have known\r\nof more failures in tomato crops, at least in the northern states, to\r\ncome from a season of persistent rains and damp atmosphere at the time\r\nwhen the plants should be in bloom and setting fruit than from any other\r\nclimatic cause.\r\n\r\n=Food supply.=--The tomato is not a gross feeder nor is the crop an\r\nexhaustive one, but the plant is very particular as to its food supply.\r\nIt is an epicure among plants and demands that its food shall not only\r\nbe to its taste in quality but that it be well served. In order for the\r\nplant to do its best, or even well, it is essential that the food\r\nelements be in the right proportions and readily available. If there is\r\na deficiency of any single element there will be but a meager crop of\r\nfruit, no matter how abundant the supply of the others. An over-supply\r\nof an element, especially nitrogen, is hardly less injurious and will\r\nactually lessen the yield of fruit though it may increase the size of\r\nthe vine. Not only must the food be in right proportions but in such\r\ncondition as to be readily available. Tomato roots have little power to\r\nwrest plant food from the soil. The use of coarse, unfermented manure is\r\neven more unsatisfactory with this than with other crops. The enormous\r\nyields sometimes obtained by English gardeners from plants grown under\r\nglass result from a supply of food of the right proportions and in\r\nsolution, instead of incorporating it in a crude condition with the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n=Cultivation.=--The tomato is grown in all parts of the United States\r\nand under very different conditions, not only as to climate and soil but\r\nas to the facilities for growing and handling the crop and the way in\r\nwhich it is done. What would be ideal conditions of soil and the most\r\nadvantageous methods under some conditions would not be at all desirable\r\nin others. In some cases the largest possible yield an acre, in others\r\nfruit at the lowest cost a bushel, or at the earliest possible date, or\r\nin a continuous supply and of the best quality, is the greatest\r\ndesideratum. It is impossible to give specific instructions which would\r\nbe applicable to all these varying conditions and requirements; so I\r\ngive general cultural directions for maximum crops with variations\r\nsuggested for special conditions and requirements, and then the reader\r\nmay follow those which seem best suited to his individual conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSelection of Soil for Maximum Crop\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge yields of tomatoes have been, and can be, obtained from soils of\r\nvarying composition, from a gumbo prairie, a black marsh muck, or a\r\nstiff, tenacious clay, to one of light drifting sand, provided other\r\nconditions, such as drainage, tilth and fertility are favorable. The\r\nConnecticut experiment station and others have secured good results from\r\nplants grown under glass in a soil of sifted coal ashes and muck, or\r\neven from coal ashes alone, the requisite plant food being supplied in\r\nsolution. But a maximum crop could never, and a full one very seldom, be\r\nproduced on a soil, no matter what its composition, which could not be,\r\nor was not put into and kept in a good state of tilth, or on one which\r\nwas poorly drained, sodden or sour, or which was so leachy that it was\r\nimpossible to retain a fair supply of moisture and of plant food.\r\n\r\nOf the 10 largest yields of which I have personal knowledge and which\r\nran from 1,000 to 1,200 bushels of fruit (acceptable for canning and at\r\nleast two-thirds of it of prime market quality) an acre, four were grown\r\non soils classed as clay loam, two on heavy clay--one of which was so\r\nheavy that clay for making brick was subsequently taken from the very\r\nspot which yielded the most and best fruit--one on what had been a black\r\nash swamp, one on a sandy muck, two on a sandy loam and one on a light\r\nsand made very rich by heavy, annual manuring for several years. They\r\nwere all perfectly watered and drained, in good heart, liberally\r\nfertilized with manures of proved right proportions for each field, and\r\nabove all, the fields were put into and kept in perfect tilth by methods\r\nsuited to each case; while the plants used were of good stock and so\r\ngrown, set and cultivated that their growth was never stopped or hardly\r\nchecked for even a day. These conditions as to soil and culture,\r\ntogether with seasons of exceptionally favorable weather, resulted in\r\nuniformly large crops on these widely different soils.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12--TOMATOES TRAINED TO STAKES ON A GEORGIA FARM]\r\n\r\nThe composition of the soil, then, as to its proportions of sand or clay\r\nis of minor importance as regards a maximum yield or as to quality of\r\nthe fruit, except as it affects our ability to put and keep the soil in\r\ngood physical condition. The tomato crop, however, particularly when the\r\nplants are trimmed and trained to stakes, as is the usual practice in\r\nthe South, as seen in Fig. 12, with crops grown for early shipment,\r\nnecessitates in the trimming and training of the plants and the\r\ngathering of the fruit when it is in the right degree of maturity for\r\nshipment a great deal of trampling of the surface regardless of whether\r\nit is wet or dry. Consequently if the surface soil has any considerable\r\nproportion of clay there is danger of compacting and even puddling it by\r\nworking when wet, to the great detriment of the crop. Again, a more or\r\nless sandy surface soil can be much more easily worked than one with a\r\nlarge proportion of clay. For these reasons our choice of a soil for the\r\nlowest cost a bushel and probably for a maximum yield should be a rich\r\nsandy or sandy loam surface soil overlying a well-drained clay\r\nsub-soil. I would prefer one which was originally covered with a heavy\r\ngrowth of beech and maple timber, though I should want it to be \"old\r\nland\" at the time. Tomatoes do not succeed as well on prairie soils,\r\nparticularly if they are at all heavy, as they do on timbered lands, but\r\none need not despair of a profitable crop of tomatoes on any soil which\r\nwould give a fair crop of corn or of cotton.\r\n\r\n=For early-ripening fruit.=--Sometimes the profit and satisfaction from\r\na tomato crop depend more largely upon the earliness of ripening than\r\nupon the amount of yield or cost of growing. In such cases a warm, sandy\r\nloam, or even a distinctly sandy soil, is to be preferred, as this is\r\napt to be warmer and the fruit will be matured much earlier on it than\r\non a heavier soil. It is essential, however, that it be well drained and\r\nwarm. Often lands classed as sandy are really colder than some of those\r\nclassed as clay, and such soils should be carefully avoided if early\r\nmaturity is important.\r\n\r\n=For the home garden.=--Here we seldom have a choice, but no one need\r\ndespair and abandon effort, no matter what the soil may be, for it is\r\nquite possible to raise an abundant home supply on any soil and that,\r\ntoo, without inordinate cost and labor. Some of the most prolific plants\r\nand the finest fruits I have ever seen were grown in a village lot which\r\nfive years before had been filled in to a depth of 3 to 10 feet with\r\nclay, coal ashes and refuse from a brick and coal yard. In another\r\ninstance magnificent fruit was grown in a garden where the soil was\r\noriginally made up chiefly of sawdust mixed with sand, drawn on a\r\nfoundation of sawmill edgings so as to raise it above the water of a\r\nswamp. Where one has to contend with such conditions he should make an\r\neffort to create a friable soil with a supply of humus by adding the\r\nmaterial needed. A very few loads, sometimes even a single load, of clay\r\nor sand will greatly change the character of the soil of a sufficient\r\narea to grow the one or two dozen plants necessary for a family supply.\r\nIn the two cases mentioned, the owner of the first named garden used\r\nboth sand and sawdust to lighten his soil, while the second drew a great\r\nmany loads of clay on his.\r\n\r\n=Growing under glass.=--I would make up a soil composed of about three\r\nparts rotted sod, two or three parts of well-rotted stable manure (and\r\nit is very important that it be well decomposed) and one part either of\r\ncoarse, sharp sand, sandy loam or clay loam, according as the sod soil\r\nis light or heavy, the aim being to form a rich, light, open soil rather\r\nthan one which is as heavy and compact as desirable for some plants. If\r\nsod soil is not available, of course, garden loam can be substituted,\r\nbut it is very important that the soil be thoroughly mixed, and\r\ndesirable that it be prepared sometime before it is to be used. Some\r\ngrowers use the same soil for several crops, simply adding some fresh\r\nmanure; but, if so used, it is important that it be stirred and\r\nthoroughly re-mixed and sterilized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nExposure and Location\r\n\r\n\r\nIn sections where there is danger of the plants being killed by early\r\nfall frosts before they have ripened their entire crop, exposure of the\r\nfield is sometimes of importance in determining the marketable yield.\r\n\r\nA gentle inclination to the south, with a protection of higher land or\r\ntimber on the sides from which frost or high winds are most likely to\r\ncome, is the best. A steep descent to the south, shut in by high land to\r\nthe east and west, so as to form a hot pocket, is not favorable for a\r\nmaximum crop although it may give a smaller yield of early ripening\r\nfruit; nor is a small field entirely surrounded by forest desirable.\r\n\r\nI once knew of a field, of about two acres, sloping to the south and\r\nentirely surrounded by heavy timber, on which two or three tomato crops\r\nwere failures when other fields on the same farm gave large yields, but\r\nafter the timber on the south and east had been cut away this field\r\ngenerally gave the largest yield in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n=Location.=--While exposure is in some cases an important factor in\r\ndetermining the total yield an acre, and so the cost, the location of\r\nthe field as regards distance from marketing point and the character of\r\nthe roads between them is of far greater importance in determining the\r\ncost and profit of crop, but one which is very often disregarded. The\r\nmarketable product of an acre of tomatoes weighs from 3 to 30 tons,\r\nwhich is not only more than that of most farm crops, but the product is\r\nof such character that its value is easily destroyed by long hauls over\r\nordinary roads. It has to be marketed within a day or two of the time it\r\nis in prime condition, regardless of the conditions of the roads or\r\nweather; so that it is quite deceptive to estimate the cost of delivery\r\nat the same rate a ton, as for potatoes or wheat, for it always costs\r\nmore, and sometimes several times more, to deliver tomatoes than it\r\nwould to deliver the same weight of less perishable crops. In most cases\r\nthe cost of picking and delivery is one of the most important factors in\r\ndetermining profit and loss, particularly when the crop is grown for\r\ncanning factories, where one often has to wait for hours for his team to\r\nunload. These conditions make it very important that the field be\r\nlocated within a short distance of, and connected by good roads with the\r\npoint of delivery.\r\n\r\n=Early maturing fruit.=--Where early maturity is the great desideratum\r\nthe exposure of the field is often very important. It should, first of\r\nall, be such as to secure comparative freedom from spring frosts so as\r\nto permit of early setting of the plants and the full benefit of the\r\nsunshine as well as protection from cold winds. There is often a great\r\ndifference in these respects between fields quite near each other.\r\nProfessor Rolfs, of Florida, mentions a case where the tomatoes in a\r\nfield sloping to the southeast and protected on the north and west by a\r\nstrip of oak timber were uninjured by a spring frost that killed not\r\nonly all the plants in neighboring fields, but those in the same field\r\nfarther away from the protecting timber. Such spots should be sought out\r\nand utilized, as often they can be used to great advantage. Immediate\r\nproximity to large bodies of water is sometimes advantageous in the\r\nSouth, but in the North it is often disadvantageous for early fruit\r\nbecause of the chilling of the air and the increased danger of spring\r\nfrosts, although affording protection from those of early fall. Here,\r\ntoo, proximity of field to shipping point and distance and\r\ntransportation rate to market are very important factors affecting\r\nprofit on the crop.\r\n\r\n=The home garden.=--The south side of buildings or of tight fences and\r\nwalls often furnishes a most desirable place for garden tomatoes, but\r\nthe plants should be set at least 6 to 10 feet from the protection and\r\nnot so as to be trained upon or much shaded by them, as the disadvantage\r\nof shutting off the light and circulation of the air, even from the\r\nnorth, would more than overbalance anything gained by the protection.\r\n\r\n=Growing under glass.=--In this country tomatoes are seldom grown under\r\nglass except during the darker winter months and the exposure of the\r\nhouse; the form of the roof and the method of glazing which will give\r\nthe greatest possible light, are of importance, for tomatoes can not be\r\nprofitably grown in a dark house. Just how the greatest amount of light\r\nmay be made available in any particular case will depend upon local\r\nconditions, but every effort should be made to secure the most\r\nunobstructed sunlight possible and for the greatest number of hours each\r\nday.\r\n\r\n=Previous crop and condition.=--In field culture tomatoes should not\r\nfollow tomatoes or potatoes. Both of these crops make use of large\r\nquantities of potash, and although a small part of that used by the\r\nplants is taken from the field in the crop, they inevitably reduce the\r\nproportion of this element in the soil--that is, in such condition as to\r\nbe readily available for the succeeding crop. It is true that the\r\ndeficiency in potash may be supplied, but it is not so easy to supply it\r\nin a condition in which it is possible for the roots of the tomato to\r\ntake it in. Unlike potatoes, tomatoes do not do well on new land,\r\nwhether it be newly cleared timber lands or new breaking of prairie.\r\nClover leaves the land in better condition for tomatoes than any other\r\nof the commonly grown farm crops, while for second choice I prefer one\r\nof peas, beans, corn, or wheat in the order named.\r\n\r\nOne of the most successful tomato growers I know of, whose soil is a\r\nrich, dark clay loam, prepares for the crop, as follows: Very late in\r\nthe fall or early in the spring he gives a clover sod a heavy dressing\r\nof manure and plows it under. In the spring he prepares the ground by\r\nfrequent cultivation and plants it with early sweet corn or summer\r\nsquash. At the time of the last cultivation of these crops he sows\r\nclover seed, covering it with a cultivator having many small teeth, and\r\nrarely fails to get a good stand and a good growth of young clover\r\nbefore the ground freezes. In the spring he plows this under, running\r\nthe plow as deep as possible and following in the furrow with a\r\nsub-soiler which stirs, but does not bring the sub-soil to the surface.\r\nHe then gives the field a heavy dressing with wood ashes and puts it\r\ninto the best possible tilth before planting his tomatoes. This grown\r\nusually harvests at least 500 bushels to the acre and has made a crop of\r\nover 1,000 bushels.\r\n\r\n=Early market.=--In some sections of the South where the soil is light\r\nand the growers depend almost wholly on the use of large quantities of\r\ncommercial fertilizer, they seem to meet with the best success by using\r\nthe same field for several successive crops, but in some places they\r\nsucceed best with plantings following a crop of cowpeas or other green\r\nsoiling crops plowed under, with a good dressing of lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFertilizers\r\n\r\n\r\nThe experiences and opinions of different gardeners and writers vary\r\ngreatly as to the amount and kind of fertilizer necessary for the\r\nproduction of the maximum crop of tomatoes. If the question were as to\r\nthe growth of vine all would agree that the more fertilizer used and the\r\nricher the soil, the better. Some growers act as if this were equally\r\ntrue as to fruit, while others declare that one can easily use too much\r\nfertilizer and get the ground too rich not only for a maximum but for a\r\nprofitable crop of fruit. I find that the amount an acre recommended by\r\nsuccessful growers varies from 40 tons of well-rotted stable manure,\r\nsupplemented by 1,000 pounds of complete fertilizer and 1,000 pounds of\r\nunleached ashes, to one of only 300 pounds of potato fertilizer.\r\n\r\nIn my own experience the largest yield that I can recall was produced on\r\nwhat would be called rich land, and the application of fertilizer for\r\nthe tomato crop was not in excess (unless possibly of potash) of that of\r\nthe usual annual dressing. I think that in preparing a soil for\r\ntomatoes, as in selecting social acquaintances, the \"new rich\" are to be\r\navoided. A soil which is rich because of judicious manuring and careful\r\ncropping for many years can scarcely be too rich, while one that is made\r\nrich by a single application of fertilizer, no matter how well\r\nproportioned, may give even a smaller yield of fruit because of its\r\nexcessive use. Again, the proportions of the various food elements vary\r\ngreatly in different locations.\r\n\r\nProfessor Halstead finds that in his section of New Jersey the liberal\r\nuse of nitrate of soda increases the yield and improves the quality,\r\nwhile in some localities of New York, Ohio, and the West, growers find\r\nthat the yield of first-class fruit was actually lessened by its use. In\r\nsome sections of the South liberality in the use of phosphates\r\ndetermines the amount and the quality of the crop, while at other points\r\nit seems to be of little value. In my own experience the liberal\r\napplication of potash, particularly in the form of wood ashes, has more\r\noften given good results than the application of any other special\r\nfertilizer.\r\n\r\nIf called upon to name the exact quantity and kind of manure for\r\ntomatoes, without any knowledge of the soil or its previous condition, I\r\nwould say 8 to 10 tons of good stable manure worked into the soil as\r\nlate as possible in the fall or during the winter and early spring and\r\n300 to 600 pounds of commercial fertilizer, of such composition as to\r\nfurnish 2 per cent. nitrogen, 6 per cent. phosphoric acid and 8 per\r\ncent. potash scattered and worked into the row about the time that the\r\nplants are set. The use of a large proportion of nitrogen tends to rank\r\ngrowth of vine and soft, watery fruit. The use of a large proportion of\r\nphosphoric acid tends to produce soft fruit with less distinctly acid\r\nflavor; of potash, to smaller growth of vine and firm but more acid\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\nI think that even more than with most crops it will be well for the\r\nfarmer to experiment to determine the best and most economical\r\nfertilizer for his soil, setting aside five to ten plots of 1 to 4\r\nsquare rods each and apply nitrate of soda, muriate of potash, wood,\r\nashes, and phosphate alone and in different combinations. The results\r\nwill suggest the combination which he can use to best advantage. In the\r\nmajority of cases, however, where the soil is reasonably rich,\r\nexpenditures for putting the ground in the best possible state of tilth\r\nwill give larger returns than those for manures in excess of that which\r\nthe land has usually received in the regular rotation for ordinary farm\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\n=For the home garden.=--Usually a dressing of wood ashes up to a rate of\r\n1 bushel to the square rod, well worked into the soil before the plants\r\nare set, and occasionally watering with liquid manure, will generally\r\ngive the best returns of any special fertilization, it being assumed\r\nthat the garden has been well enriched with stable manure.\r\n\r\n=Tomatoes under glass.=--Some growers recommend frequent waterings with\r\nliquid manure; others a surface dressing of sheep manure; still others a\r\nmulch of moderately well decayed stable manure. Plants growing under\r\nglass, particularly in pots or boxes, seem to be benefitted by so heavy\r\na dressing that if applied to plants growing outside it would be likely\r\nto give excessive growth of vine with but little fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPreparation of the Soil\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proper preparation of the soil before setting the plants is one of\r\nthe most essential points in successful tomato culture. The soil should\r\nbe put into the best possible physical condition and to the greatest\r\npracticable depth. How this can be best accomplished will vary greatly\r\nwith different soils and the facilities at the command of the planter.\r\nMy practice on a heavy, dry soil is to plow shallow as early in the\r\nspring as the ground is fit to work, and then work and re-work the\r\nsurface so as to make it as fine as possible.\r\n\r\nIf I am to use any manure which is at all coarse, it is well worked in\r\nat this time. A week or 10 days before I expect to set the plants I\r\nagain plow, and to as great a depth as practicable, without turning up\r\nmuch of the sub-soil, and if this has not been done within two years,\r\nfollow in the furrows with a sub-soil plow which loosens, but does not\r\nbring the sub-soil to the surface. Then I work and re-work the surface,\r\nat the same time working in any dressing of well-rotted manure, ashes or\r\ncommercial fertilizer that I want to use. I never regret going over the\r\nfield again, if by so doing I can improve its condition in the least. On\r\na lighter soil it might be better to compact rather than loosen as much\r\nas would give the best results with clay, but always and everywhere the\r\nsoil should be made fine, friable and uniform in condition, to the\r\ngreatest depth possible.\r\n\r\nOne of the most successful growers has said that if he could afford to\r\nspend but two days' time on a patch of tomatoes he would use a day and a\r\nhalf of the two days in fitting the ground before he set the plants. It\r\nis my opinion that any working of the ground that serves to get it into\r\nbetter mechanical condition, if done economically, will not only\r\nincrease the yield, but to such an extent as to lower the cost a bushel.\r\nT. B. Terry's teaching of the necessity for working and re-working the\r\nsoil, if one would have the largest crops of potatoes of the best\r\nquality, is even more applicable to the culture of tomatoes.\r\n\r\n=Home garden.=--Here there is no excuse for setting plants in hard,\r\nlumpy soil. It should be worked and re-worked, not simply once or twice,\r\nbut once or twice after it has been thoroughly worked. In short, the\r\ntomato bed should be made as friable as it is possible to make it and to\r\nas great a depth as the character of the sub-soil will permit.\r\n\r\n=Under glass.=--I would strongly advise that soil for tomatoes, whether\r\nit is to be used in solid beds or in pots or boxes, be thoroughly\r\nsterilized by piling it not over 15 inches deep or wide over iron pipes\r\nperforated with two lines of holes about one-sixteenth inch in diameter\r\nand 2 inches apart and filled with steam for at least a half hour. It\r\ncan be sterilized, but far less effectively, by thorough wetting with\r\nboiling water. It should always be well stirred and aired before the\r\nplants are set in it.\r\n\r\n=Starting plants.=--From about the latitude of New York city southward,\r\nit is possible to secure large yields from plants grown from seed sown\r\nin place in the field, and one often sees volunteer plants which have\r\nsprung up as weeds carrying as much or more fruit than most carefully\r\ngrown transplanted ones beside them. In many sections tomatoes are grown\r\nin large areas for canning factories, and as a farm rather than a market\r\ngarden crop, individual farmers planting from 10 to 100 acres; and to\r\nstart and transplant to the field the 25,000 to 30,000 plants necessary\r\nfor a ten-acre field seems a great undertaking. Tomato plants, however,\r\nwhen young, are of rather weak and tender growth, and need more careful\r\nculture than can be readily given in the open field; and, again, the\r\ndemand of the market, even at the canning factories, is for delivery of\r\nthe crop earlier than it can be produced by sowing the seed in the\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons it is almost the universal custom of successful\r\ngrowers to use plants started under glass or in seed-beds where\r\nconditions of heat and moisture can be somewhat under control. I\r\nbelieve, however, that the failure to secure a maximum yield is more\r\noften due to defective methods of starting, handling and setting the\r\nplants than to any other single cause. In sections where tomatoes are\r\nlargely grown there are usually men who make a business of starting\r\nplants and offering them for sale at prices running from $1 or even as\r\nlow as 40 cents, up to $8 and $10 a 1,000, according to their age and\r\nthe way they are grown; but generally, it will be found more\r\nadvantageous for the planter to start his plants on or near the field\r\nwhere they are to be grown.\r\n\r\n=Tomato plants from cuttings= may be easily grown, but such plants, when\r\nplanted in the open ground, do not yield as much fruit as seedlings nor\r\nis this apt to be of so good quality; so that, in practice, seedlings\r\nonly are used for outside crops. Under glass, plants from cuttings do\r\nrelatively better and some growers prefer them, as they commence to\r\nfruit earlier and do not make so rank a growth.\r\n\r\nSeedlings can be most easily started and grown, at least up to the time\r\nof pricking out, in light, well-ventilated greenhouses, and many large\r\ngrowers have them for this specific purpose. Houses for starting tomato\r\nplants should be so situated as to be fully exposed to the sun and not\r\nshaded in any way; be provided with heating apparatus by which a night\r\ntemperature of 60 and up to one of 80° F. in the day can be maintained\r\neven in the coldest weather and darkest days likely to occur for 60 to\r\n90 days before the plants can be safely set out in the open field; and\r\nthe houses should be well glazed and ventilated.\r\n\r\nHouses well suited for this purpose are often built of hotbed sash with\r\nno frame but a simple ridge-board and sides 1 or 2 feet high, head room\r\nbeing gained by a central sunken path and the sash so fastened in place\r\nthat they may be easily lifted to give ventilation or entirely removed\r\nto give full exposure to sunshine, or for storing when the house is not\r\nneeded. Hotbed sash 3×6 feet with side-bars projecting at the ends to\r\nfacilitate fastening them in place are usually kept by dealers, who\r\noffer them at from $1.50 to $3 each, according to the quality of the\r\nmaterial used.\r\n\r\nA hot water heating apparatus is the best, but often one can use a\r\nbrick furnace or an iron heating stove, connected with a flue of sewer\r\nor drain-pipe that will answer very well and cost much less. It requires\r\nbut 6 to 10 square feet of bench to start plants enough for an acre, and\r\na house costing only from $25 to $50 will enable one to grow plants\r\nenough for 20 acres up to the stage when they can be pricked out into\r\nsash or cloth-covered cold-frames in which they can be grown on to the\r\nsize best suited for setting in the field. When a grower plants less\r\nthan 5 acres it is often better for him to sow his seed in flats or\r\nshallow boxes and arrange to have these cared for in some neighboring\r\ngreenhouse for the 10 to 20 days before they can be pricked out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHotbeds and Cold-frames\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants can be advantageously started and even grown on to the size for\r\nsetting in open ground in hotbeds. In building these of manure it is\r\nimportant to select a spot where there is no danger of standing water,\r\neven after the heaviest rains, and it is well to remove the soil to a\r\ndepth of 6 inches or 1 foot from a space about 2 feet larger each way\r\nthan the bed and to build the manure up squarely to a hight of 2 to 3\r\nfeet. It is also very important that the bed of manure be of uniform\r\ncomposition as regards mixture of straw and also as to age, density and\r\nmoisture, so as to secure uniformity in heating. This can be\r\naccomplished by shaking out and evenly spreading each forkful and\r\nrepeatedly and evenly tramping down as the bed is built up. Unless this\r\nwork is well and carefully done the bed will heat and settle unevenly,\r\nmaking it impossible to secure uniformity of growth in different parts.\r\n\r\nHotbed frames should be of a size to carry four to six 3×6-foot sash,\r\nand made of lumber so fastened together that they can be easily knocked\r\napart and stored when not in use. They should be about 10 inches high in\r\nfront and 16 or 18 inches at the back, care being taken that if the back\r\nis made of two boards one of them be narrow and at the bottom so that\r\nthe crack between them can be covered by banking up with manure or\r\nearth. In placing them on the manure short pieces of board should be\r\nlaid under the corners to prevent their settling in the manure unevenly.\r\nI prefer to sow the seed in flats or shallow boxes filled with rich but\r\nsandy and very friable soil, and set these on a layer of sifted coal\r\nashes covering the manure and made perfectly level, but many growers sow\r\non soil resting directly on the manure; if this is done the soil should\r\nbe light and friable and made perfectly level. A perspective view of a\r\nthree-sash hotbed is given in Fig. 13, and of a cross-section in Fig.\r\n14.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13--THREE-SASH HOTBED]\r\n\r\nIn some sections, particularly in the South, it is not always easy to\r\nprocure suitable manure for making hotbeds, so these are built to be\r\nwarmed by flues under ground, but I think it much better where a fire is\r\nto be used that the sash be built into the form of a house. A hotbed of\r\nmanure is preferred to a house by some because of its supplying uniform\r\nand moist bottom heat--and one can easily give abundant air; but the\r\nsash can be built into the form of a house at but little more expense,\r\nand it has the great advantage of enabling one to work among the plants\r\nin any weather, while, if properly built, any desired degree of heat and\r\nventilation can be easily secured. Except when very early ripening fruit\r\nis the desideratum, plants started with heat but pricked out and grown\r\nin cold-frames without it, but where they can be protected during cold\r\nnights and storms, will give better results than those grown to full\r\nsize for the field in artificial heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14--CROSS-SECTION OF HOTBED]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15--COLD-FRAMES ON HILL-SIDE]\r\n\r\n=Cold-frames.=--In locations where tomatoes are much grown large areas\r\nare devoted to cold-frames covered either by sash or cloth curtains.\r\nSash give much better protection from cold and on this account are more\r\ndesirable, particularly where very early fruiting is wanted, but their\r\nfirst cost is much greater and the labor of attending to beds covered by\r\nthem is much more than where cloth is used. Sash-covered beds should be\r\nof single width and run east and west, but if the beds are covered with\r\ncloth it is better that they be double width (12 feet) and run north and\r\nsouth. The front of the single and the sides of the double width beds\r\nshould be 8 to 10 inches high, held firmly erect by stakes and perfectly\r\nparallel, both horizontally and vertically, with the back or with the\r\ncentral support. This should be 6 inches higher than the front. The\r\ncross strips, when sash are used, should be made of a 3-inch horizontal\r\nand a 1-1/2-inch vertical strip of 1-inch lumber nailed together very\r\nfirmly in the form of an inverted T, the vertical pieces projecting 1\r\ninch at each end and resting on the front and back of the bed and\r\nforming supports and guides for the sash. Some growers use vertical\r\nstrips as heavy as 2×3 or 4 inches for stepping across the beds. When\r\nthe plants are to be taken to the field, the sash and guides can be\r\neasily removed. (Fig. 15.)\r\n\r\nGround to be covered with cold-frames should be made very friable and\r\nrich by repeated plowing and working in of a liberal dressing of\r\nwell-rotted stable manure and wood ashes. In southwestern New Jersey,\r\nwhere immense areas of early tomatoes are grown, the soil of the beds\r\nfor a depth of about 6 inches is removed and a layer 3 to 5 inches deep\r\nof well-rotted stable manure is placed in. That made of a mixture of\r\nmanure from horses, cattle and hogs is preferred. It is important that\r\nthe manure be so well rotted that it will not heat, and so dry that it\r\nwill not become pasty when tramped into a firm, level layer. On this\r\nthey place a layer of nearly 3 inches deep of rich, friable, moderately\r\ncompact soil and prick out the plants into this. The roots soon bind the\r\nmanure and soil together and by cutting through the manure so as to form\r\nblocks one can carry the plants to the fields with but very little\r\ndisturbance of the root.\r\n\r\n=Cloth covers for beds= should be made of heavy, unbleached sheeting or\r\nlight duck, and it is better that the selvage run up and down the bed\r\nrather than lengthwise. The cloth is torn into lengths of about 13 feet\r\nand then sewn together with a narrow double-stitched flat seam so as to\r\nform a sheet 13 feet wide and about 8 inches longer than the bed. The\r\nedges are tacked every foot to the strips about 2 inches wide by 7/8\r\ninch thick with beveled outside edges and laid perfectly in line. A\r\nsecond line of strips is then nailed to the first so as to break joints\r\nwith it and so that the two will form a continuous roller about a foot\r\nlonger than the bed with the edge of the curtain firmly fastened in its\r\ncenter. The center of the curtain is secured to the central ridge of the\r\nbed by strips of lath. When rolled up, the rollers are held in place by\r\nloops of rope around their ends and when they are down they are held by\r\nsimilar loops to the notched tent-pins driven into the ground or to\r\nwooden buttons fastened to the sides and ends of the frame as shown in\r\nFig. 16.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16--TRANSPLANTING TOMATOES UNDER CLOTH-COVERED\r\nFRAMES (Photo by Prof. W. G. Johnson)]\r\n\r\nCloth covers are sometimes dressed with oil, but this is not to be\r\nrecommended, though it is an advantage to have them wet occasionally\r\nwith a weak solution of copper sulphate or with sea water as a\r\npreservative and to prevent mildew. Such covers, well cared for, may\r\nlast five years or be of little use after the first, depending upon the\r\ncare given them. They can be made from 50 to 200 feet long and two men\r\ncan roll them up or down very quickly.\r\n\r\nWhen cloth covers are used the supporting cross-strips should not be\r\nover 3 inches wide nor more than 3 feet apart; sometimes the strips are\r\nmade to bind the sideboard and ridge together by means of short pieces\r\nof hoop iron or of barrel hoop. These are so placed and nailed as to\r\nhold the upper edge of sideboards and of the central ridge flush with\r\nthe cross-strips, thus forming a smooth surface for cloth to rest on and\r\nenabling one easily to \"knock down\" and remove the frames to facilitate\r\nthe taking of the plants from the bed to the field and the storing of\r\nthe frames for another season.\r\n\r\n=Flats for starting seeds.=--Any shallow box may be used or the plants\r\nsown directly in the beds without them, but flats of a uniform size are\r\nto be preferred--these will pack well on the greenhouse shelves; or in\r\nthe hotbed we make them with 7/8 inch thick ends and 1/2 inch thick\r\nsides and bottom, the latter if of a single board having four half-inch\r\nholes for drainage and in any case having two narrow strips about 1/4\r\ninch thick nailed across their bottoms so as to allow drainage water to\r\nescape freely when the boxes are set on hard, cool floors. Two or three\r\nsuch boxes, 35-1/2 inches long, 12 inches wide and 3 inches deep, will\r\nbe sufficient to start plants enough for an acre. I like to use similar\r\nboxes only 4 inches deep for growing the plants after they are pricked\r\nout, particularly if this is to be done in a greenhouse, as by turning\r\nthem we can equalize exposure to light and thus distribute the plants in\r\nthe field where they are to be set with the least possible disturbance.\r\nOne would need nearly 60 such boxes for plants enough for an acre. On\r\naccount of the lessened necessity for watering when plants are set in\r\nbeds rather than in boxes, many growers prefer to grow their plants in\r\nthat way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nStarting Plants\r\n\r\n\r\nThis has been the subject of a vast amount of horticultural writing, and\r\nthe practice of different growers, and in different sections, varies\r\ngreatly. I give the methods I have used successfully, together with\r\nreasons for following them, but it may be well for the reader to modify\r\nthem to suit his own conditions and requirements.\r\n\r\n=Largest yield.=--Some 45 to 50 days before plants can be safely set in\r\nthe open field the flats in which the seed is to be sown should be\r\nfilled with light, rich, friable soil, it being important that its\r\nsurface be made perfectly level, and that it be compact and quite moist,\r\nbut not so wet as to pack under pressure. Sow the seed in drills 3/8\r\ninch deep and 2 to 3 inches apart at the rate of 10 to 20 to the inch;\r\npress the soil evenly over them, water and place in the shade in an even\r\ntemperature of 80 to 90° F. As soon as the seeds begin to break soil,\r\nwhich they should do in three to four days, place in full light and\r\ntemperature of 75 to 80°, keeping the air rather close so as to avoid\r\nnecessity of watering. After a few days reduce the temperature to about\r\n65° and give as much air as possible. Some growers press a short piece\r\nof 2-inch joist into the soil of the benches, so as to form trenches 2\r\ninches wide and about 3/8 inch deep, and so spaced as to be under the\r\ncenter of each row of glass, their sash being mostly made of five-inch\r\nglass. In this, by using a little tin box with holes in the top, like\r\nthose of a pepper-box, they scatter seeds so that they will be nearly\r\n1/8 to 1/4 inch apart, over the bottom of the 2-inch wide trench, and\r\nthen cover. This has the advantage of evenly spacing the plants and so\r\nlocating the rows that the plants will be little liable to injury from\r\ndrip.\r\n\r\nYoung tomato plants are very sensitive to over-supply of water and some\r\nof the most successful growers do not water at all until the plants are\r\nquite large and then only when necessary to prevent wilting. In 10 to 15\r\ndays, or as soon as the central bud is well started, the plants should\r\nbe pricked out, setting them 3 to 6 inches apart, according to the size\r\nwe expect them to reach before they go into the field; 5 inches is the\r\nmost common distance used. I think it better to set the full distance\r\napart at first, not to transplant a second time. It is very important\r\nthat this pricking out should be done when the plants are young and\r\nsmall, though many successful growers wait until they are larger. The\r\nsoil in which they are set, whether it be in boxes or beds, should be\r\ncomposed of about three parts garden loam, two parts well-rotted stable\r\nmanure and one part of an equal mixture of sand and leaf mold, though\r\nthe proportion of sand used should be increased if the garden loam is\r\nclayey. The soil in the seed-boxes or in the beds, when the seedlings\r\nare taken up, should be in such condition, and the plants be handled in\r\nsuch a way that nearly all the roots, carrying with them many particles\r\nof soil, are saved. The plants should be set a little, and but a little,\r\ndeeper than they stood in the seed-box and the soil so pressed about\r\nthe roots, particularly at their lower end, that the plants can not be\r\neasily pulled out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17--SPOTTING-BOARD FOR USE IN COLD-FRAMES]\r\n\r\nWhere plants are set in beds the work can be facilitated by the use of a\r\n\"spotting-board\" (Fig. 17). This should be about 1 foot in width, and\r\nhave pegs about 3 inches long, 3/4 inch in diameter at the base and\r\ntapering to a point, fastened into the board the distance apart the\r\nplants are to be set. It should also have narrow projections carrying a\r\nsingle peg nailed to the top of board at each end, so that when these\r\npegs are placed in the end holes of the last row the first row of pegs\r\nin the \"spotting board\" will be the right distance from the last row of\r\nholes or plants. By standing on this, while setting plants in one set of\r\nholes, holes for another set are formed. If the conditions of soil, air\r\nand plants are right and the work is well done, the plants will show\r\nlittle tendency to wilt, and it is better to prevent their doing so by\r\nshading, rather than by watering, though the latter should be resorted\r\nto if necessary. When plants are set in beds, some growers remove the\r\nsoil to a depth of about 6 inches and put in a layer of about 2 inches\r\nof sifted coal ashes, made perfectly level, and then replace the soil.\r\nThis confines the roots to the surface and enables one to secure nearly\r\nall of them when transplanting. The plants should be well established\r\nin 24 hours and after this the more light and air that can be given,\r\nwithout the temperature falling below 40° F. or subjecting the plants to\r\ncold, dry wind, the better.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18--SPOTTING-BOARD FOR USE ON FLAT (From W. G.\r\nJohnson)]\r\n\r\nOne can hardly overstate the importance to the healthy growth of the\r\nyoung tomato plant of abundant sunshine, a uniform day temperature of\r\nfrom 60 to 80° F., or of the ill effects of a variable temperature,\r\nparticularly if it be the result of cold, dry winds, or of a wet, soggy\r\nsoil, the effect of over-watering. These points should be kept in mind\r\nin caring for the plants, and every effort made to secure, as far as\r\npossible, the first named conditions and to avoid the latter. The\r\nframes, whether they be covered with sash or cloth, but more\r\nparticularly if with sash in sunshine and with curtains in dull days,\r\nshould be opened so as to prevent their becoming too hot, and so as to\r\nadmit air. And in a greenhouse full ventilation should be given\r\nwhenever it is possible to do so without exposure to too low a\r\ntemperature. If the plants are in boxes and on greenhouse shelves, it is\r\nimportant that these be turned end for end every few days to equalize\r\nexposure to light and give full exposure to the sun. The plants should\r\nbe watered only when necessary to prevent wilting, and the beds should\r\nbe covered during heavy rains. A \"spotting-board\" for use on flats is\r\nseen in Fig. 18.\r\n\r\nThe most unfavorable weather conditions are bright sun combined with a\r\ncold wind, and cold storms of drizzling rain and frosty nights. Loss\r\nfrom the latter cause may often be prevented by covering the beds with\r\ncoarse straw, which should always be provided for use in an emergency.\r\nMany growers provide a second curtain--an old one answers very well--to\r\nthrow over the straw-covered beds. Beds so covered will protect the\r\nplants from frost in quite severe weather. Watering should especially be\r\navoided for nearly three days before setting in fields; but six to\r\ntwelve hours before it is well to water thoroughly, though not so as to\r\nmake the soil at all muddy. About five days after pricking out and again\r\nabout five days before the plants are to go into the field and five days\r\nafter they are set, they should be sprayed with Bordeaux mixture.\r\n\r\n=Early ripening fruit.=--Here the aim is to secure, by the time they can\r\nbe set in the field, plants which have come by an unchecked but\r\ncomparatively slow rate of growth to the greatest size and maturity\r\nconsistent with the transplanting to the field without too serious a\r\ncheck. The methods by which this is accomplished vary greatly and\r\ngenerally differ materially from those given above. The seed is planted\r\nmuch earlier and 60 to 90 days before it is at all safe to set plants in\r\nthe open field; while a steady rate of growth is desirable, it should be\r\nslow and the plants kept small by a second and even third and fourth\r\ntransplanting, and especial care taken to avoid the soft and irregular\r\ngrowth resulting from over-watering or over-heating. Any side shoots\r\nwhich may appear should be pinched out and a full pollination of the\r\nfirst cluster of the blossoms secured, either by direct application of\r\npollen or by staking or jarring the plants on bright days; and finally,\r\nspecial efforts made to set the plants in the field as early and with as\r\nlittle check as possible. Growers are often willing to run considerable\r\nrisk of frost for the sake of early setting.\r\n\r\nWhen one has sandy land a very profitable crop can sometimes be secured\r\nby sowing the seed very early, and growing the plants on in beds until\r\nthe first cluster of fruit is set, then heeling them in, much as nursery\r\ntrees are, but so close that they can be quickly covered in case of\r\nfrost. As soon as it is at all safe to do so, they are set in the open\r\nground, very closely, on the south side of ridges, so that only the\r\nupper one-third of the plant is exposed, the remainder being laid nearly\r\nlevel and covered with earth.\r\n\r\nSo treated the plants will ripen the upper one or two clusters very\r\nearly but will yield little more until late in the season, and it is\r\ngenerally more profitable to plow them up and put in some other crop as\r\nsoon as the first clusters of fruit have ripened. Others pinch out the\r\ncentral bud as soon as it is well formed, usually within 10 days from\r\nthe sowing of the seed. When this is done a great proportion of the\r\nplants will start branches from the axils of the cotyledons; these\r\nusually develop blossoms in the third to the fifth node and produce\r\nfruit much lower than in a normal plant. It is questionable if there is\r\nany gain in time from seed to fruit by this method, but it enables one\r\nto get older plants of a size which it is practicable to transplant to\r\nthe field.\r\n\r\nIn most cases it will be found more profitable and satisfactory so to\r\ngrow the plants that by the time they can be safely set out of doors\r\nthey will be in vigorous condition, about 6 to 10 inches tall, stout,\r\nhealthy and well hardened off. Such plants will ripen fruit nearly, and\r\noften quite as early as older ones and will produce a constant\r\nsuccession of fruit, instead of ripening a single cluster or two and\r\nthen no more until they have made a new growth.\r\n\r\n=For late summer and early fall.=--It is generally true in the South and\r\noften equally so in the North, that there is a more eager local demand\r\nfor tomatoes in the late summer and fall months, after most of the\r\nspring set plants have ceased bearing, than in early summer. In Michigan\r\nI have often been able to get more for choice fruit in late October and\r\nin November than the best Floridas were sold for in May or early June,\r\nand certainly in the South the home use of fresh tomatoes should not be\r\nconfined to spring set plants. For the fall crop in the South seed may\r\nbe sown in late spring or up to the middle of July, in beds shaded with\r\nframes, covered with lath nailed 3 to 4 inches apart and the plants set\r\nin the field about 40 days from sowing, the same care being taken to\r\nput the ground into good condition as is recommended for the spring\r\nplanted crop.\r\n\r\nA second plan, which has sometimes given most excellent results, is to\r\ncut back spring set plants which have ripened some fruit but which are\r\nnot completely exhausted, to mere stubs, and spade up the ground about\r\nthem so as to cut most of the roots, water thoroughly and cover the\r\nground with a mulch of straw. Most of the plants so treated will start a\r\nnew and vigorous growth and give most satisfactory returns.\r\n\r\n=Fruit at least expenditure of labor.=--When this is the great\r\ndesideratum, many growers omit the hotbed and even the pricking out,\r\nsowing the seed as early as they judge the plants will be safe from\r\nfrost, and broadcast, either in cold-frames or in uncovered beds, at the\r\nrate of 50 to 150 to the square foot and transplanting directly to the\r\nfield. Or they may be advantageously sown in broad drills either by the\r\nuse of the pepper-box arrangement suggested on page 60, or a garden\r\ndrill adjusted to sow a broad row. In Maryland and the adjoining states,\r\nas well as in some places in the West, most of the plants for crops for\r\nthe canners are grown in this way and at a cost of 40 cents or even less\r\na 1,000. The seed should be sown so that it will be from 1/4 to 1/2 inch\r\napart and the plants thinned as soon as they are up so that they will be\r\nat least 1/2 inch apart. Where seed is sown early with no provision for\r\nprotection from the frost it is always well to make other sowings as\r\nsoon as the last begins to break ground in order to furnish reserve\r\nplants, if the earlier sown lots be destroyed by frost. Others even sow\r\nthe seed in place in the field, thinning out to a single one in a hill\r\nwhen the plants are about 2 inches high. Some of the largest yields I\r\nhave ever known have been raised in this way, but the fruit is late in\r\nmaturing and generally the method is not so satisfactory as starting the\r\nplants where they can be given some protection, and transplanting them\r\nto the field.\r\n\r\n=Plants for the home garden.=--These may be grown in pots or boxes set\r\nin the sunniest spot available and treated as has been described. In\r\nthis way plants, equal to any, may be grown without the aid of either\r\nhotbed or greenhouse. It will generally be more satisfactory, however,\r\nto secure the dozen or two plants needed from some one who has grown\r\nthem in quantity than to grow so small a lot by themselves. In selecting\r\nplants, take those which are short, stiff, hard, and dark green in\r\ncolor with some purple color on the lower part of the stem rather than\r\nthose which are softer and of a brighter green, or those in which the\r\nfoliage is of a yellowish green; but in selection it must be remembered\r\nthat varieties differ as to the color of foliage, so that there may be a\r\ndifference in shade which is not due to conditions.\r\n\r\n=Plants under glass.=--If to be grown in pots or boxes, \"prick out,\"\r\nwhen small, into three-inch pots and as they grow re-pot several times\r\nso that when set in the pots or beds in which they are to fruit, they\r\nare stout plants 12 to 16 inches high. Plants propagated from cuttings\r\ngive much better returns relatively under glass than out of doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nProper Distance for Planting\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best distance apart for the plants to be set in the field varies\r\ngreatly with the soil, the variety, the methods of cultivation and other\r\nconditions. Plants set as close in rich clay soil as would give the best\r\nresults in a warm, sandy one, or those of a strong growing sort, like\r\nBuckeye State, set as close as would be desirable for sorts, like\r\nAtlantic Prize or Dwarf Champion, would give little but leaves and\r\ninferior fruit. In field culture I like to space the plants so as to\r\nfacilitate gathering the fruit, and recommend the following arrangement:\r\nSet the plants according to soil and the variety 2-1/2 to 4 feet apart\r\nin the row, omitting two or three in every 75 or 100 plants so as to\r\nform driveways across the rows. Set the first and second and the third\r\nand fourth rows, etc., 2-1/2 to 3-1/2 and the second and third and the\r\nfourth and fifth rows 5-1/2 to 6 feet apart. As the plants grow, those\r\nof the first and second and those of the third and fourth rows, etc.,\r\nare thrown together and in many cases it will pay to have a pair of\r\nnarrow horizontal strips or wires nearly 18 inches from the ground upon\r\nwhich they can be thrown.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement of the plants allows us to continue to cultivate the\r\nwider spaces between the second and third and fourth and fifth, etc.,\r\nrows, much longer, and tends to confine the necessary tramping and\r\npacking of the soil when gathering the fruit chiefly to these rows--an\r\nimportant point in case the soil is wet. The rows can be marked out the\r\nday before, but it is better to set the plants in the cross-rows and\r\nthat these be marked out just ahead of the setters. In this arrangement\r\nthe distances are equivalent to from 2-1/2×4 feet, requiring 4,300\r\nplants to the acre, to 4×5 feet, requiring but about 2,100 plants. The\r\nlatter distance is that most commonly used by New Jersey growers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19--TOMATOES SOWN AND ALLOWED TO GROW IN HOTBEDS]\r\n\r\n=In the home garden.=--It will usually be more satisfactory to give each\r\nplant plenty of space, setting them 5 or 6 feet apart each way, except\r\nin the case of the dwarf sorts, which should be from 3-1/2 to 3 feet\r\napart. A few plants at these distances will usually be much more\r\nsatisfactory than more set nearer together, but the larger growing\r\nsorts should have at least 3 feet and the dwarf sorts 2 feet. When one\r\nhas a hotbed or cold-frame it is often an advantage to set a row of\r\ntomato plants nearly 18 inches apart at the back end much earlier than\r\nthey could be safely set in the open ground, and if these are allowed to\r\ngrow on in place, as shown in Fig. 19, being pruned and tied to stakes,\r\nthey will give some very early fruit.\r\n\r\n=In the greenhouse.=--Experience and practice differ as to the most\r\ndesirable distance apart for plants under glass. But 2 feet apart, where\r\nquality is the main consideration, and 18 inches when quantity, if fair,\r\nis of more importance than extra quality.\r\n\r\n=Setting plants in the field.=--The economical and successful setting of\r\nplants in the field is an important element of successful tomato culture\r\nand is very dependent upon soil and weather conditions. It is assumed\r\nthat the soil of the field has been put into the best possible condition\r\nof tilth, but its condition as to moisture is also very important. The\r\nworst condition is when it is wet and muddy, especially if it is at all\r\nclayey--not only is the cost of setting greatly increased, but plants\r\nset in such soil can seldom, by any amount of care, be made to do well,\r\nespecially if a heavy beating rain or dry windy weather follows\r\nimmediately; the condition is less unfavorable if a warm gentle rain or\r\nstill moist weather follows. A dry cold wind, even if the day is cloudy\r\nand the soil in good condition, is also unfavorable, particularly if the\r\nroots of the plants are exposed.\r\n\r\nWet soil, cold, dry air and wind are the conditions to be avoided.\r\nMoist, not wet, soil and still, warm air are to be desired; whether the\r\nday is sunny or not is less important. There is a certain definite time,\r\nwhich does not usually extend beyond a few days, when any lot of plants\r\nis in the best condition for setting in the field. It is hardly possible\r\nto describe this condition more than to say it is when the plants are as\r\nlarge as they can be without crowding and are in a state where they can\r\nbest stand the shock of removal.\r\n\r\nIt will always be a matter of judgment as to how long it is best to hold\r\nplants, which are in condition for setting, for favorable weather\r\nconditions. They can sometimes be held a few days, by scant watering and\r\nfull exposure, or in some cases by taking from the bed and heeling in,\r\nas nurserymen do trees; but it is better to set when the weather is\r\nunfavorable or to run some risk from frost rather than to hold them in\r\nthis way too long. The wise selection of time for setting is an\r\nimportant factor in securing a good and profitable crop.\r\n\r\nThe South Jersey growers, to whom early ripening fruit is the great\r\ndesideratum and who have a very warm soil, and grow plants so they are\r\nquite hardy and can be transplanted with little check, set them in the\r\nfield very early, some seasons by the last of April; and if the plants\r\ncan be got out so as to have two or three days of favorable weather to\r\nget established before it comes, they seem to be little hurt even by a\r\nquite severe frost. The first essential to successful transplanting is\r\nto have well-grown, healthy, hardy plants; the second is that they be in\r\ngood condition for setting, which can be secured by giving them, for a\r\nfew days before planting, a scant supply of water and fullest possible\r\nexposure to air and sun, and then a thorough wetting a few hours before\r\nthey are to be set.\r\n\r\nThe South Jersey plan of growing and setting plants gets them into the\r\nfield in the best condition of any method I know. Two to five days\r\nbefore they expect to plant, the growers go over the beds and, by means\r\nof a hoe that has been straightened and sharpened to form a sort of\r\nspade, they cut through the soil and manure so as to divide the plants\r\ninto blocks of six. A few hours before they are to plant, they saturate\r\nthe bed with water. By means of a flattened shovel they can take up the\r\nblocks of plants and place them in a cart or low wagon so the soil is\r\nscarcely disturbed at all, the roots in the manure serving to bind the\r\nwhole together. In the meantime furrows are opened along the rows and\r\nthe cart driven to the field; the plants in the blocks are cut apart\r\nwith a butcher knife placed in the furrow and the earth drawn about\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nPlants set in this way often do not wilt at all, even in hot sunshine.\r\nWhen plants are grown in boxes these can be taken to the field and\r\nplants taken from them in much the same way and so that they will be\r\ndisturbed but little. In setting the plants it should always be borne in\r\nmind that while sunshine on the leaves of a plant rarely does any\r\ninjury, it is very injurious to the roots, and the exposure of the roots\r\nto the sun or to cold, dry wind, should be avoided in every practicable\r\nway, such as by carrying the plants to the field laid on the sides of a\r\nbox, which is then carried with its bottom toward the sun so as to have\r\nthe plants in the shade, always handling the plant in the shade of one's\r\nbody, etc. It is well worth while to walk to the end of the row to\r\ncommence work in order to secure this. It is attention to such details\r\nthat distinguishes one whose plants nearly always do well from one who\r\nloses a large proportion of those he handles.\r\n\r\n=Fruit at the least expenditure of labor.=--The plants are prepared for\r\nsetting by scant watering, and are taken up so as to secure as much root\r\nas possible with little soil adhering to them. Great care should be\r\ntaken in taking the plants from the bed, and in handling them, _to avoid\r\ntwisting the stems_, as to do so very seriously injures the plants,\r\noften to such an extent that they will fail to grow, no matter how\r\ncarefully set out. Some growers dip the roots in a very thin clay mud,\r\nhardly thicker than thin cream, but I have not found this of advantage\r\nexcept, sometimes, when the roots are to be exposed for a longer period\r\nthan usual and I do not recommend it for general use. In setting, holes\r\nare made either with a long dibble, in the hands of the one who\r\ndistributes the plants, or by a short one, in the hands of the setter;\r\nthe plants are dropped into them a little deeper than they had stood in\r\nthe bed, the earth closed about the roots, by pressure from the side.\r\nEspecial care should be taken that this is well done, particularly at\r\nthe bottom; the earth should be so firmly pressed to the root that the\r\nplant cannot be easily pulled from the soil. In some sections\r\ntransplanting machines (Fig. 20) are used and liked, but most planters\r\nprefer to set by hand and the additional cost is not great. An expert\r\nwith one or two boys to assist in handling the plants can put out as\r\nmany as 5,000 plants in a day. A machine requiring more help to run it\r\ncan set from 15,000 to 20,000.\r\n\r\n=In the home garden=, when but a few plants are to be set, it will be\r\nbetter to put them in after 4 P. M. and use water in setting, but the\r\nwet soil should be covered with some dry earth to prevent its caking.\r\n\r\n=In the greenhouse.=--Plants are better set in the places where they are\r\nto fruit just before their first blossoms open and should be set in\r\naccordance with the suggestions given for transplanting to the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20--PLANTING TOMATOES ON A DELAWARE FARM (Photo by\r\ncourtesy of _American Agriculturist_)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCultivation\r\n\r\n\r\n=For maximum crop.=--As soon as plants are set the ground should be well\r\ncultivated to the greatest depth practicable. We should remember that\r\nthe tomato needs for its best development a very friable soil, while the\r\ntramping necessary in setting out the plants and gathering the fruit\r\ntends to compact and harden the soil. Often transplanting has to be done\r\nwhen the soil is wet, and we need to counteract the injury from tramping\r\nby immediate cultivation; but, at the same time, we must avoid the\r\ndisturbing of the plants any more than is necessary, and all of our\r\ncultivation should be done with these points in mind. Just how it can be\r\ndone best will vary not only with the location and the facilities\r\navailable, but with the weather conditions, so that it is not well to\r\nattempt to give explicit directions any further than that one can hardly\r\ncultivate too deeply for the first seven days nor too often for the\r\nfirst 30 days after the plants are set, provided he avoids turning the\r\nsoil when it is too wet. Even walking through the field when the soil is\r\nwet is injurious and should be avoided, in proportion as the soil is a\r\nclayey one.\r\n\r\n=At least expenditure of labor.=--I hardly need add to or change the\r\nsuggestions given above for tomatoes at least cost, for any cultivation\r\nwisely given will probably do as much to reduce cost per bushel by\r\nincreasing the yield per acre as any other expenditure. _In the garden_\r\nit is advisable that from the time the plants are set until the fruit\r\nripens, the surface soil about them be stirred every evening when it is\r\nnot actually wet.\r\n\r\n=In the greenhouse.=--The surface of the soil should be kept open by\r\nfrequent stirring or, as is the practice of some successful growers, it\r\nmay be covered with a mulch of partially rotted manure. The plants\r\nshould be watered only as needed to prevent wilt, and special pains\r\ntaken to guard against too much moisture either in the soil or in the\r\nair, particularly on dark days. The night temperature should be\r\nuniformly about 60° F. while in the day it should be 75°, and if it be\r\nbright and sunny it may go to 90° or even higher. Air should be given\r\nfreely whenever feasible to do so without too greatly reducing\r\ntemperature. A moderate degree of moisture should be maintained in the\r\nair, care being taken that it does not become too moist, especially\r\nduring dark days. There is more danger from the air becoming too moist\r\nthan from its becoming too dry, though either extreme is injurious.\r\n\r\n=Pollinating.=--The structure and relations of the parts of the tomato\r\nflower are such that while perfect pollination is possible, and in\r\nplants grown in the open air usually takes place without artificial\r\nassistance, it is not so likely to occur when plants are grown under\r\nglass, particularly in the winter months, and it is usually necessary to\r\nsecure it by artificial means. With vigorous, healthy plants and on\r\nlight, sunny days, it can be accomplished by jarring the plants near\r\nmidday. This generally throws enough pollen into the air so that an\r\nabundance of it reaches each receptive stigma. With less vigorous plants\r\nand on dark days it is necessary to hand pollinate the flowers. This is\r\ndone by gathering the pollen by means of jarring the plants, so that it\r\nfalls into a watch crystal or other receptacle secured at the end of a\r\nwand, and then pressing the projecting pistils of other flowers into it\r\nso that they may become covered with the pollen.\r\n\r\nSome growers transfer the pollen with a camel's-hair-brush; others by\r\npulling off the corolla and adhering anthers and rubbing them over the\r\nstigma of other flowers. Fruit rarely follows flowers that are not\r\npollinated, and if it is incomplete the fruit will be unsymmetrical and\r\nimperfectly developed. As tomato flowers secrete but very little, if\r\nany, honey and are not attractive to insects, it is of no advantage to\r\nconfine a hive of bees in the tomato house in the way which is so useful\r\nin one where cucumbers or melons are growing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nStaking, Training and Pruning\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder favorable conditions of soil and climate, plants of most varieties\r\nof tomatoes will, in field culture, yield as much fruit if allowed to\r\ngrow naturally and unpruned as if trained and pruned. This is especially\r\ntrue of the sorts of the Earliana type and on warm, sandy soils, while\r\nit may not be true of the stronger growing sorts, or on rich clay lands\r\nor where the fertilizer used contains an excess of nitrogen. In any case\r\nmore fruit can be grown to the acre on pruned and staked plants because\r\nmore of them can be gotten on an acre; and it is an advantage to grow\r\nthem in that way because it enables us, by later cultivation, to keep\r\nthe ground in good tilth longer; also it facilitates the gathering of\r\nthe fruit; and last, but not least, it generally enables us to produce\r\nbetter ripened and flavored fruit.\r\n\r\nStaking and pruning used to be the almost universal practice in the\r\nSouth, but in many sections growers have abandoned it, claiming that\r\nthey get as good or better results without it. In the North it is rarely\r\nused in field culture, though often used in private gardens and by some\r\nmarket gardeners, and both staking or tying up and pruning are essential\r\nto the profitable growing of tomatoes under glass. In the South, stout\r\nstakes from 1 to 2 inches in diameter and 4 to 5 feet long are driven\r\ninto the ground so that they can be depended upon to hold the plants\r\nerect through the heaviest storms, as seen in Fig. 21. This is generally\r\nand wisely done as soon as the plant is set, though some growers delay\r\ndoing so until the fruit is well set, claiming that the disturbance of\r\nstaking, tying and pruning tends to hasten the ripening of the fruit.\r\nThe plant is then tied up, the tying material being wrapped once about\r\nthe stake and then looped about the plant so as to prevent slipping on\r\nthe stake or choking the stem of the plant as it enlarges. Raffia is\r\nlargely used and is one of the best tying materials, but short pieces of\r\nany soft, cheap string can be used. The tying up will need to be\r\nrepeated as the stem elongates, which it will do very rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn pruning the tomato we should allow the central shoot of the young\r\nplant to grow, and remove all of the side shoots which spring from the\r\naxils of the leaves and sometimes even from the fruit clusters, as seen\r\nin Fig. 22. It is very desirable that this be done when the branches are\r\nsmall, as there is then less danger of seriously disturbing the balance\r\nof the growing forces of the plant, and also because there is less\r\ndanger of careless workmen cutting off the main shoot in place of a\r\nlateral, which would seriously check the ripening of the fruit. It is\r\nespecially important that any shoots springing from the fruit cluster be\r\nremoved as early as possible. For these reasons it is important that, if\r\nthe plants are to be pruned at all, the field be gone over every few\r\ndays. If the pruning is not well done it is a disadvantage rather than a\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21--TRAINING TOMATOES IN FLORIDA TO SINGLE STAKE\r\n(Photo by courtesy of Prof. P. H. Rolfs, Director Florida Experiment\r\nStation)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22--TOMATO PLANT TRAINED TO SINGLE STAKE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23--METHOD OF TRAINING TO THREE STEMS IN\r\nFORCING-HOUSE AND OUT OF DOORS]\r\n\r\nSome growers allow two or three (Fig. 23) instead of one shoot to grow,\r\nselecting for the second the most vigorous of the shoots starting from\r\nbelow the first cluster of fruit. In some locations they stop or pinch\r\nout the main shoot just above the first leaf above the third or fourth\r\ncluster; in some soils it is an advantage and in others rather a\r\ndisadvantage to do this. I have seldom practiced it. When fruit at the\r\nlowest cost a bushel is the desideratum, neither pruning nor staking is\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24--METHOD OF TRAINING ON LINE IN GREENHOUSE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25--READY TO TRANSPLANT IN GREENHOUSE (Redrawn from\r\nphoto by New York Experiment Station)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26--TRAINING YOUNG TOMATOES IN GREENHOUSE AT NEW\r\nYORK EXPERIMENT STATION (Photo by courtesy Prof. U. P. Hedrick)]\r\n\r\n=For home gardens.=--In the home garden trellising and pruning are often\r\nvery desirable, as they enable us not only to produce more fruit in a\r\ngiven area but of better quality. Many forms of trellis, have been\r\nrecommended. Where the plants are to be pruned as well as supported, as\r\nthey should always be in gardens, there is nothing better than the\r\nsingle stake, as described above. For a trellis without pruning, one\r\nto three stout hoops supported by three stakes so as to surround the\r\nplant which is allowed to grow through and fall over them, or two or\r\nmore parallel strips supported about a foot from the ground on each side\r\nof a row of plants answer the purpose, which is simply to keep the plant\r\nup from the ground and facilitate the free circulation of the air among\r\nleaves and fruit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27--TOMATOES IN GREENHOUSE AT OHIO EXPERIMENT\r\nSTATION (Photo by courtesy of C. W. Waid)]\r\n\r\nI have seen tomatoes grown very successfully by the side of an open\r\nfence. Two stakes were driven into the ground about 6 inches from the\r\nfence and the plant, but slanting outward and away from each other. The\r\ntops of the stakes were fastened to the fence by wooden braces, and then\r\nheavy strings fastened to the fence around the stakes and back to the\r\nfence, the whole with the fence forming a sort of inverted pyramidal\r\nvase about 3 feet across at the top. In this the plant was allowed to\r\ngrow, but it would be essential to success that the fence be an open\r\none.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28--FORCING TOMATOES IN GREENHOUSE AT NEW HAMPSHIRE\r\nEXPERIMENT STATION. NOTE CHARACTER OF BED ON THE GROUND FLOOR. (Photo by\r\ncourtesy of Prof. H. F. Hall)]\r\n\r\n=In the greenhouse.=--Here pruning and training are essential. The\r\nplants may be supported by wires or strings (a coarse wool twine will\r\nanswer), twisting the string about the plant as it grows. The growth is\r\nusually confined to a single shoot, though some growers allow two (Fig.\r\n24); the method of pruning does not differ from that given for field\r\nculture, but it is more important that the plants be gone over often\r\nand the branches removed when small. If allowed to do so, branches would\r\nspring from the axil of each leaf and the plant would become a perfect\r\nthicket of slender branches and leaves and produce but little fruit. The\r\nmain stem is sometimes pinched out after three or four clusters of fruit\r\nare set and the branch from the axil of the first leaf above is allowed\r\nto take its place. This tends to hasten the maturing of the fruit\r\nclusters already set. After several clusters have matured, or the main\r\nstem reaches the top of the house, some growers allow a shoot from the\r\nbottom to grow and as soon as fruit sets on it the first stem is cut\r\naway and this takes its place. Others prefer to remove the old plant\r\nentirely and set in young ones. A plant ready for transplanting is shown\r\nin Fig. 25. In figures 26, 27 and 28 are shown interior views of\r\ngreenhouses at the New York station at Geneva, the Ohio station at\r\nWooster, and the New Hampshire station at Durham. Note the strong,\r\nvigorous plants in Fig. 26; the method of utilizing tile for watering in\r\nFig. 27; and the ground-floor bedding in Fig. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nRipening, Gathering, Handling and Marketing the Fruit\r\n\r\n\r\nTomatoes ripen and color from within outward and they will acquire full\r\nand often superior color, particularly about the stems, if, as soon as\r\nthey have acquired full size and the ripening process has fairly\r\ncommenced, they are picked and spread out in the sunshine. The point of\r\nripeness when they can be safely picked is indicated by the surface\r\ncolor changing from a dark green to one of distinctly lighter shade with\r\na very light tinge of pink. Fruit picked in this stage of maturity may\r\nbe wrapped in paper and shipped 1,000 or 2,000 miles and when unwrapped\r\nafter two or ten days' journey will be found to have acquired a\r\nbeautiful color, often even more brilliant than that of a companion\r\nfruit left on the vine. Enclosing the fruit while on the vine and about\r\nhalf grown in paper bags has been recommended, and it often results in\r\ndeeper and more even coloring and prevents injury from cracking, but the\r\nfruit so ripened, while more beautiful, is not so well flavored as that\r\nripened in the sun. But Americans are said to taste with their eyes, so\r\nthat in this country, fruit of this beautiful color will often out-sell\r\nthat which is of better flavor though of duller color.\r\n\r\nThe tomato never acquires its full and most perfect flavor except when\r\nripened on the vine and in full sunlight. Vine and sun-ripened\r\ntomatoes, like tree-ripened peaches, are vastly better flavored than\r\nthose artificially ripened. This is the chief reason why tomatoes grown\r\nin hothouses in the vicinity are so much superior to those shipped in\r\nfrom farther south. After it has come to its most perfect condition on\r\nthe plant the fruit deteriorates steadily, whether gathered or allowed\r\nto remain on the vine, and the more rapidly in proportion as the air is\r\nhot and moist. That it be fresh is hardly less essential to the first\r\nquality in a tomato than it is to such things as lettuce and cucumbers.\r\n\r\n=Gathering.=--As is the case with most horticultural products, the best\r\nmethods of gathering, handling and marketing the fruit vary greatly with\r\nthe conditions under which the fruit was grown and how it is to be used,\r\nand it requires the best of judgment to gather it in the stage of\r\nmaturity in which it will give the best satisfaction, under the\r\nconditions and for the purposes for which it is to be used. It is\r\nimpossible to give exact rules for determining when the fruit is in the\r\nbest condition. This can only be learned by experience, guided by a\r\nknowledge of the ripening habit of the fruit, which not only varies\r\nsomewhat in different localities, but with different varieties. In the\r\nextreme South, fruit is picked for shipment before it shows more than\r\nthe slightest tint of color at the blossom end; the depth of color which\r\nis considered as indicating shipping condition deepens as we go north\r\nand nearer market.\r\n\r\nGenerally the fruit should be left on the vine no longer than will\r\npermit of its becoming fully ripe by the time it reaches its\r\ndestination and is exposed for sale. When the fruit is to be shipped any\r\ndistance the field should be gone over frequently, as often as every\r\nsecond or third day or even every day in the hight of the season, and\r\ncare taken to pick every fruit as soon as it is in proper condition.\r\nWhen it is to be sold in nearby markets or to a cannery the exact stage\r\nof maturity, when picked, is not so important, although it is always an\r\nadvantage not to gather until the fruit is well colored and before it\r\nbegins to soften. Some growers for canneries make but three or four\r\npickings, but in this case it is well to gather the ripest fruit\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nIn picking and handling great care should be taken not to mar or bruise\r\nthe fruit, and the stems should be removed as the fruit is picked to\r\nprevent bruising in handling. A bruise or mar may not be as conspicuous\r\nin a tomato as in a peach, but it is quite as injurious. It is a great\r\ndeal better for pickers to use light pails rather than baskets, the\r\nflexibility of the latter often resulting in bruises. It is an advantage\r\nto have enough of these so that the sorting can be from the pail, but if\r\nthis is not practical the fruit should be carefully emptied on a sorting\r\ntable for grading. It should first of all be separated with regard to\r\nits maturity. A single fruit which is a little riper or greener than the\r\nremainder may make the entire package unsalable. It should also be\r\ngraded as to freedom from blemishes or cracks, and as to size, form and\r\ncolor. It is assumed that the fruit for each package is to be of the\r\nsame variety, but often there is quite a variation in different fruits\r\nfrom even the same vine; the more uniform in all respects the fruit in\r\na package is the more attractive and salable it becomes. There is no\r\nfruit where careful grading and packing have more influence on the price\r\nit will command.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29--FLORIDA TOMATOES PROPERLY WRAPPED FOR LONG\r\nSHIPMENT (Photo by courtesy of _American Agriculturist_)]\r\n\r\nI know of a certain noted peach-grower in northern Michigan who grew,\r\neach year, some 2 to 5 acres of tomatoes for the Chicago market. It was\r\nhis custom to pick out about one-tenth of the best of the fruit, putting\r\nit into small and attractively labeled packages; the remainder of the\r\ncrop was sorted over and from one-tenth to one-fifth of it rejected and\r\nfed to stock or sold to a local cannery. The remainder was sent to\r\nChicago with his selects, but as common stock, and usually brought more\r\nthan his neighbors received for unsorted fruit; but the check he\r\nreceived for his selects was usually as large as that for his commons,\r\nthus giving him about 33-1/3 per cent. more for his crop than his\r\nneighbors received for their equally good, but unsorted, fruit--to say\r\nnothing of what he received for the rejected fruit and the saving of\r\nfreight which, he said, was usually enough to pay the actual cost of\r\nsorting.\r\n\r\nTomatoes are usually classed as vegetables but, when ripe, they require\r\nas careful handling as the most delicate fruits and are as easily and\r\nseriously injured by bruising and jarring. Just how this can be avoided\r\nand the fruit gotten from the vine to the possibly distant consumer in\r\nthe best condition will vary in different cases. Tomatoes from the South\r\n(Fig. 29) are generally marketed in carriers which, though varying\r\nsomewhat, are essentially alike and consist of an open basket or boxes\r\nof veneer holding about 10 pounds of fruit. When shipped, two, four or\r\nsix of these are packed in crates made of thin boards, so as to protect\r\nthe fruits but give them plenty of air.\r\n\r\n=Packing.=--Most of the fruit sent to New York and Philadelphia markets\r\nfrom New Jersey and other northern states is in boxes or crates holding\r\nabout 5/8 of a bushel and so made as to facilitate ventilation when\r\npiled in cars or warehouses. Fruit for the canneries is usually picked\r\nand handled in bushel crates of lath. These various packages are usually\r\nsold in the flat and the grower puts them together as is convenient\r\nbefore the crop comes on; but in many sections where there are large\r\nshipments they are often put together by the package dealers. Fig. 30\r\nshows tomatoes as packed by the Ohio experiment station.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30--GREENHOUSE TOMATOES PACKED FOR MARKET (By\r\ncourtesy Ohio Experiment Station)]\r\n\r\n=Fruits after frost.=--Sometimes when there is a great quantity of\r\npartially ripe and full grown green fruit on the vines which is liable\r\nto be spoiled by an early fall frost, it can be saved by pulling the\r\nvines and placing them in windrows and covering them with straw. Of\r\ncourse the vines should be handled carefully to shake off as little\r\nfruit as possible. If the freeze is followed by a spell of warm, dry\r\nweather the fruit will ripen up so as to be quite equal to that shipped\r\nin from a distance. A second plan is to pull the vines and hang them up\r\nin a dry cellar or out-house, or lay them on the ground in an open\r\ngrove of trees, or beneath the trees of an adjoining orchard.\r\n\r\nStill another plan is to gather the green fruit and spread it not more\r\nthan two to four fruits deep in hotbed frames, which are then covered\r\nwith sash. Local grocers are usually glad to pay good prices for this\r\nlate fruit, and in seasons of scarcity I have known canners to buy\r\nthousands of bushels so ripened at better prices than they paid for the\r\nmain crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nAdaptation of Varieties\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may be their botanical origin, the modern varieties of\r\ncultivated tomatoes vary greatly in many respects, and while these\r\ndifferences are always of importance their relative importance differs\r\nwith conditions. When the great desideratum is the largest possible\r\nyield of salable fruit at the least expenditure of labor, the qualities\r\nof the vine may be the most important ones to be considered, while in\r\nprivate gardens and for a critical home market and where closer\r\nattention and better cultivation can be given, they may be of far less\r\nimportance than qualities of fruit.\r\n\r\n=Habits of growth.=--Whether it be standard or dwarf, compact or\r\nspreading, is sometimes of great importance as fitting the sorts for\r\ncertain soils and methods of culture. On heavy, moist, rich land, where\r\nstaking and pruning are essential to the production of fruit of the best\r\nquality, it is of importance that we use sorts whose habits of growth\r\nfit them for it; while on warm, sandy, well-drained land, staking and\r\npruning may be of little value, and a different habit of growth more\r\ndesirable. We have sorts in which the vine is relatively strong growing\r\nwith few branches, upright, with long nodes and small fruit clusters\r\nwell scattered over the vine. They are usually very productive through a\r\nlong season but generally late in maturing. Stocks of this type are\r\nsometimes sold, I think improperly, as giant climbing, or Tree tomato.\r\nThe Buckeye State is a good type of these sorts. (Fig. 31.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31--BUCKEYE STATE, SHOWING LONG NODES AND DISTANCE\r\nBETWEEN FRUIT CLUSTERS]\r\n\r\nOther varieties make a stout and vigorous but shorter growth, with more\r\nand heavier branches, shorter nodes and many small medium-sized clusters\r\nof fruit well distributed over the plant and which mature through a\r\nfairly long season. These sorts are usually very productive and our most\r\npopular varieties generally belong to this type, of which the Stone\r\n(Fig. 32) is a good representative of the more compact and the Beauty of\r\nthe more open growing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32--STONE, AND CHARACTERISTIC FOLIAGE]\r\n\r\nOther varieties form many short, weak, sprawling branches, with\r\nusually large and sometimes very large clusters of fruit produced\r\nchiefly near the center of the plant and which mature early and all\r\ntogether. Plants of this type will often mature their entire crop and\r\ndie by the time those of the first type have come into full crop. The\r\nAtlantic Prize (Fig. 33) and Sparks Earliana are examples of this type.\r\n\r\nIn sharp contrast with the above is the tomato De Laye, often called\r\nTree tomato. This originated about 1862 in a garden at Chateau de Laye,\r\nFrance. In this the plant rarely exceeds 18 inches in hight, is\r\nsingle-stemmed or with few very short branches, the nodes very short,\r\nthe fruit clusters few and small. From this, by crossing with other\r\ntypes, there has been developed a distinct class of dwarf tomatoes which\r\nare of intermediate form and character and are well represented by the\r\nDwarf Champion (Fig. 34). Early maturity is sometimes the most important\r\nconsideration of all, though, because of increasing facilities for\r\nshipping from the South, it is less commonly so than formerly. For\r\nshipping and canning it is generally, though not always, desirable that\r\nthe crop mature as nearly together as possible, that it may be gathered\r\nwith the fewest number of pickings and advantage taken of a favorable\r\nmarket; while for the home garden and market a longer season is\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33--ATLANTIC PRIZE, AND ITS NORMAL FOLIAGE]\r\n\r\n=Foliage.=--Abundant, broad and close, or scanty cut and open foliage is\r\nsometimes of importance, according to whether the location, season and\r\nother conditions make it desirable that the foliage protect the fruit\r\nfrom the sun or admit the sunlight, with as little obstruction as\r\npossible, to the center of the plant. In different sorts, we have\r\ngradations from those in which the leaves are so deeply cut as to have a\r\nfern-like appearance, to those like the Magnus, or potato-leaved, in\r\nwhich the margin of each leaflet is entire, and from those in which the\r\nleaflets are so few and small as to scarcely shut out the light at all\r\nto those in which they are so numerous that the light can hardly\r\npenetrate to the center of the plant. The Atlantic Prize is an\r\nillustration of the scanty foliaged sorts, and the Royal Red or Buckeye\r\nState of those in which it is more abundant. As to color, the foliage\r\nvaries from the dark blue-green of the Buckeye State to the light,\r\ndistinctly yellowish-green of the Honor Bright.\r\n\r\n=Varietal differences as to fruit.=--These are often more important than\r\nthose of vine. For canning, for forcing, and some other uses and for\r\ncertain markets, a medium and uniform size is a very important quality,\r\nwhile in other cases uniformity is not important and the larger the\r\nindividual fruits, provided they be well formed, the better. We have\r\ndifferent sorts in which the size of the fruit varies from that of the\r\nCurrant, which is scarcely 1 inch in circumference, to that of\r\nPonderosa, of which well-formed specimens over 20 inches in\r\ncircumference have been grown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34--DWARF CHAMPION. NOTE CHARACTER OF FOLIAGE]\r\n\r\n=Shape.=--It is always desirable that the outline of the vertical\r\nsection shall be a flowing line with a broad and shallow, or no\r\ndepression at the stem end and as little as possible at the opposite\r\npoint; but the relative importance of this, or whether the general\r\noutline shall be round or oval, either vertically or horizontally,\r\nforming a round, long or flat fruit, is largely determined by how the\r\nfruit is to be used, and by individual taste. A round fruit is best\r\nfor canning; a long one is the most economical for slicing, though some\r\nprefer a flat one for this purpose. It is always desirable that the\r\noutline of the horizontal section shall be smooth, flowing and\r\nsymmetrical, and if there be any distinct sutures that they shall be\r\nshallow and broad; but the relative importance of this, and whether the\r\noutline be round or oval, is wholly a matter of individual taste. Some\r\npeople and markets prefer one shape and others a very different one.\r\nSize and smoothness of fruit are the factors which control price in some\r\nmarkets, while in others these points are quite secondary to color and\r\ncharacter of flesh.\r\n\r\nWe have sorts which vary from the perfectly spherical ones of the grape\r\nand cherry, to those in which the vertical diameter is less than a third\r\nof that of the horizontal section; and the pear-shaped in which the\r\nvertical diameter is twice or thrice that of the longest horizontal\r\nsection, and from those in which the outline of both the vertical and\r\nhorizontal sections is smooth and flowing to those in which the vertical\r\nsection has a deep indentation at both the stem and opposite ends, and\r\nthose in which the horizontal section is broken by deep indentures and\r\nsutures often disposed with great irregularity.\r\n\r\nFor shipping long distances, for the rough handling, and for the easy\r\npreparation for the fruit for canning, a thick, tough skin is desirable,\r\nwhile for home use it is objectionable. Freedom from blemish or skin\r\ncrack is also often an important quality, and we have sorts which vary\r\ngreatly in these respects. The color of the skin, whether purple, red,\r\nyellow or white, is a matter of taste. In some markets the choice is\r\ngiven to purple fruit, like the Beauty, while in others it can only be\r\nsold at a reduced price. There are few who would care to use either\r\nyellow or white fruit for canning or cooking in any way, but many prefer\r\nthem for slicing, or like to use them with the red for this purpose; we\r\nhave sorts showing every gradation from white or light yellow in color\r\nthrough shades of red to dark purple-red, and still others which show\r\ndistinct colors in splashings and shadings.\r\n\r\n=Character of flesh.=--Many consider that the greater the number of cells\r\nand the larger the proportion of flesh to that of pulp and seed the\r\nbetter. This may be true of itself, but the fruit-like acid tomato\r\nflavor which most people value is found chiefly in the pulp, and the\r\nfruit which has not a due proportion of pulp and flesh seems to be\r\ninsipid and tasteless. Again, the division into many small cells is\r\noften connected with a large and pithy placenta and unevenness in\r\nmaturity and coloring, which faults often more than overbalance any\r\nadvantage from small cells and thick flesh. The size and character of\r\nthe placenta are important qualities.\r\n\r\nIn some sorts it is large, dry, pithy and hard, extending far into the\r\nfruit even to below the center; and sometimes seems to divide into\r\nsecondary or branch placentas or masses of hard cellular matter, while\r\nin other varieties it is small and so soft and juicy as scarcely to be\r\ndistinguished from the flesh. Usually, but not invariably, the large and\r\npithy placenta is correlated with large-sized fruit having many cells;\r\nwhere this is the case it practically necessitates the cutting away and\r\nwasting of a large proportion of the fruit in preparing it for canning,\r\nso that the canners usually prefer round, medium-sized fruits.\r\n\r\nThe character of the interior of the fruit varies greatly in different\r\nvarieties. Both the exterior and divisional walls vary in thickness and\r\nin consistency. In some varieties they are comparatively thin, hard and\r\ndry; in others, thicker, softer and more juicy. In some cases there is\r\nbut little interior wall, the fruit being divided into but few--even but\r\ntwo--cells of even size and shape, while in others there are many cells\r\nof varying size and shape. Varieties also differ greatly as to the\r\namount, consistency and flavor of the pulp and the number of seeds. It\r\nrequires from 300 to 500 pounds of ripe fruit to furnish a pound of seed\r\nof Ponderosa, while with some of the smaller, earlier sorts one can get\r\na pound of seed from 100 to 200 pounds of fruit.\r\n\r\n=Coloring and ripening.=--Uniformity and evenness in coloring and\r\nripening are an important quality. Tomatoes generally color and ripen\r\nfrom within outward, and from the point opposite the stem upward, but\r\nvarieties differ in the evenness and rapidity with which this takes\r\nplace. It is always desirable that the ripening be as even as possible\r\nand that there be no green and hard spots either at the surface or in\r\nthe flesh, but often perfection in this respect is correlated with such\r\nlack of size and solidity as to counterbalance it. Rapidity in ripening,\r\nin a general way, is desirable for fruit to be used at home, and\r\nundesirable in that which is to be shipped.\r\n\r\nThe time a tomato fruit will remain in usable condition and the amount\r\nof rough handling it will endure without becoming unsalable are most\r\nimportant commercial qualities depending largely upon the combined\r\neffects of the form and structure of the fruit, solidity and firmness of\r\nthe flesh and ripening habit. In all these respects we have varieties\r\nwhich differ greatly, from the Honor Bright, which requires as much time\r\nto ripen, and when ripe is firm-fleshed and will remain usable as long\r\nas a peach, to those which 24 hours after reaching their full size are\r\nfully colored and ripe, and in 24 hours more are so over-ripe and soft\r\nthat they will break open of their own weight.\r\n\r\nThese are only some of the varietal differences of the tomato. Are such\r\ndifferences of practical importance? I think they are, and that a wise\r\nselection of the type best suited to one's own particular conditions and\r\nrequirements is one of the most essential requisites of satisfactory\r\ntomato culture. How important it seems to practical tomato growers may\r\nbe illustrated by an actual case.\r\n\r\nIn a certain section of New Jersey the money-making crop is early\r\ntomatoes, and they are grown to such an extent that from an area with a\r\nradius of not exceeding 5 miles they have shipped as much as 15,000\r\nbushels in one day, and the shipments will often average 8,000 bushels\r\nfor days together. They have tried a great number of sorts, but have\r\nsettled upon a certain type of a well-known variety as that best suited\r\nto their conditions and needs. Seeds of this variety which are supposed\r\nto produce plants of the exact type wanted can be bought from seedsmen\r\nfor 10 cents an ounce and at much lower rates for larger quantities,\r\nbut when one of the most successful growers of that locality, because of\r\nchange of occupation, offered seed selected by him for his own use for\r\nsale at auction, it brought $3 an ounce. This price was paid because of\r\nthe confidence of the bidders that the seed could be depended upon to\r\nproduce plants of the exact type wanted for their conditions; and I was\r\nassured that the use of this high-priced seed actually added very\r\nlargely to the profits from every field in that vicinity in which it was\r\nused, but the use of some of the same lot of seed by planters in Florida\r\nresulted in financial loss because the type of plant produced was not\r\nsuited to their conditions and requirements.\r\n\r\nA wise answer can only be given after a study of each case, and no one\r\ncan do this so well as the planter himself. He should know, as no one\r\nelse can know, his own conditions and requirements, and should be able\r\nto form very exact ideas of just what he wants, and the doing so is, in\r\nmy opinion, one of the most important requisites for satisfactory tomato\r\ngrowing. I also believe that it is as impossible for a man to answer\r\noffhand the question, \"What is the best variety of tomato?\" as for a\r\nwise physician to answer the question, \"What is the best medicine?\"\r\n\r\n=Varietal names= and descriptions mean something quite different in the\r\ncase of plants like the tomato, which are propagated by seed, from what\r\nthey do with plants like the apple and strawberry, which are propagated\r\nby division. In the latter case all the plants of the variety are but\r\nparts of the primal origination, and so are alike. A description is\r\nsimply a more or less complete and accurate definition of what a\r\ncertain immutable thing really is, but in the case of plants propagated\r\nby seed the variety is made up of all the plants which accord with a\r\ncertain ideal. Bailey says, \"Of all those which have more points of\r\nresemblance than of difference,\" and a description of the variety is of\r\nthat ideal which in common practice is not fixed, but may and generally\r\ndoes vary not only with different people but from time to time. The only\r\nfoundation for varietal names in plants of this class is an agreement as\r\nto the ideal the name shall stand for. Under modern horticultural\r\npractice when anyone has been able to secure seed most of which he is\r\nreasonably sure will develop into plants of a distinct type different\r\nfrom that of any sort known to him, he has a distinct variety, so that\r\nit is not surprising that we should find that American seedsmen offer\r\ntomato seed under more than 300 different names, and those of Europe\r\nunder more than 200 additional, so that we have more than 500 varietal\r\nnames, each claiming to stand for a distinct sort. Now it is quite\r\npossible--indeed, it is certain--that we might have 500 tomato plants\r\neach different in some respect, either of vine, leaf, habit of growth,\r\nor character of fruit, from any of the others and that these differences\r\nmight make plants of one type better suited to certain conditions and\r\nuses than any other; but it is very certain that these 500 names do not\r\nstand for such differences. It is doubtless true that a portion--though\r\nI think but a small portion--of these different sorts exist simply as a\r\nmatter of commercial expediency; but by far a greater part of them exist\r\nbecause one has found that plants of a certain character were better\r\nsuited to some set of conditions and requirements than any sort with\r\nwhich he was acquainted, and having secured seed which he thought would\r\nproduce plants of that character, has offered it as of a distinct sort.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that a better acquaintance with sorts already in\r\ncultivation would have prevented the naming of many of these stocks as\r\ndistinct varieties. What is of far more practical importance, the same\r\nname does not always stand for precisely the same type with different\r\nseedsmen, or even with the same seedsmen in different years; nor are the\r\nseedsmen's published descriptions such as would enable any one to learn\r\nfrom them just what type he will receive under any particular name, or\r\nwhich sort he should buy in order to get plants of any desired type.\r\nSeedsmen's catalogs are published and distributed gratuitously at great\r\nexpense, and are issued, primarily, for the sake of selling the seeds\r\nthey offer. They answer the purpose for which they are designed, in\r\nproportion as they secure orders for seeds. Will this be measured by the\r\naccuracy and completeness of their descriptions? I think that it needs\r\nbut slight acquaintance with the actual results of advertising to answer\r\nin the negative, and whatever your answer may be, the answer given by\r\nthe catalogs themselves is an emphatic no.\r\n\r\nIn a recent case I looked very carefully through the catalogs of 125\r\nAmerican seedsmen who listed a certain variety which is very markedly\r\ndeficient in a certain desirable quality, and found that but 37 of the\r\n125 mentioned the quality in connection with the variety at all and of\r\nthese but 7 admitted the deficiency, while 30 told the opposite of the\r\ntruth. Even if a complete, exact and reliable description of a variety\r\nwas published by disinterested persons, one could not be sure of getting\r\nseed from seedsmen which would produce plants of that exact type, since\r\nthere is no agreement or uniformity among them as to the exact type any\r\nvarietal name shall stand for.\r\n\r\nOne way of getting seed of the exact type wanted is to do as the South\r\nJersey growers did: go to work and breed up a stock which is uniformly\r\nof the type wanted; but this involves more painstaking care than many\r\nare willing to give, though I think not more than it would be most\r\nprofitable for them to expend for the sake of getting seed just suited\r\nto their needs.\r\n\r\nA second and easier way is to secure samples of the most promising sorts\r\nand from the most reliable sources and grow them on one's own farm;\r\nselect the stock which seems best for him and buy enough of that exact\r\nstock for several years' planting, and in the meantime be looking for a\r\nstill better one. Tomato seed stored in a cool, dry place will retain\r\nits vitality for from three to seven years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSeed Breeding and Growing\r\n\r\n\r\nThe potentialities of every plant and its limitations are inherent,\r\nfixed and immutable in the seed from which it is developed and are made\r\nup of the balanced sum of the different tendencies it receives in\r\nvarying degree from each of its ancestors back for an indefinite number\r\nof generations. A very slight difference in the character or the degree\r\nof any one of the tendencies which go to make up this sum may make a\r\nmost material difference in the balance and so in the resulting\r\ncharacter of the plant produced. Different plants, even of the same\r\nancestry, vary greatly in prepotency or in the relative dominance of the\r\ninfluence they have over descendants raised from seed produced by them.\r\n\r\nIn some cases all the plants raised from seed produced by a certain\r\nplant will be essentially alike and closely resemble the seed-bearing\r\nplant, while seed from another plant of the same parentage will develop\r\ninto plants differing from each other and seemingly more influenced by\r\nsome distant ancestor or by varying combinations of such influences than\r\nof those of the plant which actually produced the seed from which they\r\nwere developed. Successful seed breeding can only be accomplished by\r\ntaking advantage of these principles of heredity and variation, and by a\r\nwise use of them it is possible to produce seed which can be depended\r\nupon to produce plants of any type possible to the species.\r\n\r\n=The first essential for breeding= is to have a clear and exact\r\nconception of precisely what, in all respects, the type shall be and\r\nthen the securing of seed which has come from plants of that exact\r\ncharacter for the greatest possible number of generations, carefully\r\navoiding the introduction by cross-pollination of tendencies from plants\r\ndiffering in any degree from the desired type. Secondly, seed should be\r\nused from plants which have been proven to produce seed, which will\r\ndevelop into plants like themselves or are strongly prepotent. A\r\npractical way to accomplish this in the tomato is as follows:\r\n\r\nBy experiment and observation form a very clear conception of precisely\r\nthe type of plant and fruits which is best suited to your needs. This\r\nmay be done by the study of available descriptions of sorts, by\r\nconference with those who have had experience in your own or similar\r\nclimatic and soil conditions and in raising fruit for the same purposes\r\nand, best of all, by trials of samples of different sorts and stocks on\r\nyour own grounds. Having formed such a conception, write out the\r\nclearest possible description of exactly what you want and the ideal\r\nplant you are aiming at, stating as fully and minutely as possible every\r\ndesirable quality and also those to be avoided. I consider not only the\r\nformation of an exact ideal, but the writing out of a most minute and\r\nexact description of precisely what in every particular the ideal plant\r\nshould be and the rigid adherence to that exact ideal in selection, as\r\nthe most important elements of successful seed breeding. Without it one\r\nis certain to vary from year to year in the type selected and in just so\r\nfar as he does this, even if it be toward what might be called\r\nimprovements or in regard to an unimportant quality, he undermines all\r\nhis work and makes it impossible to establish a strain which can be\r\nrelied upon to produce an exact type.\r\n\r\nWith this description in hand, search out one or more plants which seem\r\nthe nearest to the ideal. In doing this it should be kept in mind that\r\nthe character of the seed is determined by the plant rather than by the\r\nindividual fruit. Therefore, a plant whose fruit is most uniformly of\r\nthe desired type should be chosen over one having a small proportion of\r\nits fruits of very perfect type, the others being different and\r\nvariable. Save seed from one or more fruits from each of the selected\r\nplants, keeping that from each fruit, or at least each plant, separate.\r\nGive it a number and make a record of how nearly, in each particular,\r\nthe plant and fruit of each number come to the desired ideal. I regard\r\nthe saving of each lot separately and recording its characters as very\r\nimportant, even when all have been selected to and come equally close to\r\nprecisely the same ideal. Quite often the seed of one plant will produce\r\nplants precisely like it, while that of another, equal or superior, will\r\nproduce plants of which no two are alike and none like that which\r\nproduced the seed, so that often the mixing of seed from different\r\nplants of the same general type, and seemingly of equal quality,\r\nprevents the establishment of a uniform type.\r\n\r\nThe next year from 10 to 100 plants raised from each lot are set in\r\nblocks and labeled. As they develop the blocks are studied and compared\r\nwith the original description of the desired type and that of each plant\r\nfrom which seed was saved, and the block selected in which all the\r\nplants come the nearest to the desired type, and which show the least\r\nvariation. From it plants are selected in the same way and to the same\r\ntype as the previous year. It is better to make selections from such a\r\nblock than to take the most superior plants from all of the blocks, or\r\nfrom one which produced but one or but a few superlative ones, the rest\r\nbeing variable.\r\n\r\nIt is also well to consider the relative importance of different\r\nqualities in connection with the degree to which the different lots\r\napproach the ideal in these respects. Such a course of selection\r\nintelligently and carefully carried out will give, in from three to five\r\nyears, strains of seed greatly superior and better adapted to one's own\r\nconditions than any which it is possible to purchase. A single or but a\r\nvery few selections may be made each year, and the superior value of the\r\nseed of the remainder of the seed blocks for use in the field will be\r\nfar more than the cost of the whole work.\r\n\r\n=Growing and saving commercial seed.=--The ideal way is for the seedsman\r\nto grow and select seed as described above and give this stock seed to\r\nfarmers who plant in fields and cultivate it, much as is recommended for\r\ncanning, and save seed from the entire crop, the pulp being thrown away.\r\nOnly a few pickings are necessary and the seed is separated by machines\r\nworked by horse power at small cost, often not exceeding 10 cents a\r\npound. They secure from 75 to 250 pounds per acre, according to the\r\nvariety and crop, and the seedsmen pay them 40 cents to $1 a pound for\r\nit. Some of our more careful seedsmen produce all the seed they use in\r\nthis way; others buy of professional seed growers, who use more or less\r\ncarefully grown stock seed. In other cases when the fruit is fully ripe\r\nit is gathered, and the seeds, pulp and skins, are separated by\r\nmachinery; the seed is sold to seedsmen, the pulp made into catsup, and\r\nonly the skins are thrown away. Still others get their supply by washing\r\nout and saving the seed from the waste of canneries. Such seed is just\r\nas good as seed saved _from the same grade of tomatoes_ in any other\r\nway, but the fruit used by the canneries is, usually, a mixture of\r\ndifferent crops and grades, and even of different varieties, and\r\nconsequently the seed is mixed and entirely lacking in uniformity and\r\ndistinctness of type.\r\n\r\nGenerally from 5 to 20 per cent. of the plants produced by seed as\r\ncommonly grown either by the farmer himself or the seedsmen, though they\r\nmay be alike in more conspicuous characteristics, will show varietal\r\ndifferences of such importance as to affect more or less materially the\r\nvalue of the plant for the conditions and the purposes for which it is\r\ngrown. In a book like this it is useless to attempt to give long\r\nvarietal descriptions even of the sorts commonly listed by seedsmen,\r\nsince such descriptions would be more a statement of what the writer\r\nthought seed of that variety should be rather than of what one would be\r\nlikely to receive under that name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nProduction for Canning\r\n\r\n\r\n=Growing for canning= has many advantages over growing for market. Some\r\nof these are that it is not necessary to start the plants so early, that\r\nthey can be grown at less cost, and set in the field when smaller and\r\nwith less check, and on this latter account are apt to give a large\r\nyield. It is not necessary to gather the fruit so often, nor to handle\r\nit so carefully, while practically all of it is saleable. For these\r\nreasons the cost of production is lower and it is less variable than\r\nwith crops grown for market. Still farmers and writers do not agree at\r\nall as to the actual cost. It is claimed by some that where the factory\r\nis within easy reach of the field the cost of growing, gathering and\r\ndelivering a full yield of tomatoes need not exceed $12 to $18 an acre,\r\nwhile others declare they cannot be grown for less than $40. Nearly\r\none-third of this cost is for picking and delivering, and varies more\r\nwith the facilities for doing this easily and promptly and with the\r\nyield than with crops grown for market. A large proportion of the crops\r\ngrown for canning are poorly cultivated and unwisely handled, so that\r\nthe average yield throughout the entire country is very low, hardly\r\nexceeding 100 bushels an acre. But where weather and other conditions\r\nare favorable, and with judicious cultivation, a yield of 300 to 800\r\nbushels an acre can be expected. I have known of many larger ones.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the tomatoes grown for canning are planted under\r\ncontract, by which the farmer agrees to deliver the entire yield of\r\nfruit fit for canning, which may be produced on a given area, at the\r\ncontract price per bushel or ton. The canner is to judge what fruit is\r\nfit for canning and this often results in great dissatisfaction. To the\r\ngrower it seems in many cases as though the quantity of acceptable fruit\r\npaid for was determined quite as much by the abundance or scarcity of\r\nthe general crop as by the weight hauled to the factory. The prices paid\r\nby the factories for the past 10 years run from 10 to 25 cents a bushel,\r\nwhile canning tomatoes in the open market for the same period have\r\nbrought from 8 to 50 cents a bushel, which, however, are exceptional\r\nprices. In all but two of the past 10 years uncontracted tomatoes could\r\ngenerally be sold, in most sections, for more than was paid on contract.\r\nI have given the price a bushel, though canning tomatoes are usually\r\nsold by the ton. The cost of the product of a well-equipped cannery is\r\ndivided about as follows: fruit, 30 per cent.; handling, preparing and\r\nprocessing the fruit, 18 per cent.; cost of cans, labels, cases, etc.,\r\n43 per cent.; labeling, packing and selling, 0.035 per cent.;\r\nincidentals, 0.055 per cent.\r\n\r\n=Canning on the farm.=--While as a general proposition such work as\r\ncanning tomatoes can usually be done at less cost in a central plant,\r\nyet in many cases the grower can profitably do this on the farm, thus\r\nsaving not only the expense of delivery at the factory, but the\r\ndissatisfaction with weights credited and delays in receiving the fruit.\r\nBut very little special apparatus or machinery (more than some form of\r\nboiler for supplying steam) is needed, and this and the cans can be\r\nreadily obtained of dealers in canners' supplies. In Maryland and\r\nneighboring states many dealers furnish all necessary machinery, cans\r\nand other requisites and contract for the crop delivered in cans.\r\n\r\nCanning on the farm where the fruit is grown would be more generally\r\npracticed except for the popular demand that the canned product shall be\r\nbrighter colored than it is possible to produce from fruit alone, and\r\nthe necessary dyeing and other doctoring can be more easily and\r\nskilfully done at a central factory, though it is always at the\r\nsacrifice of flavor and healthfulness for the sake of appearance.\r\nAnother advantage of canning on the farm is that it can be done with\r\nless waste of fruit. The hauling to the factory and delay in working the\r\nfruit result in a great deal of waste. The average cannery does not\r\nobtain more than 1,200 pounds of product from a ton of fruit, there\r\nbeing 800 pounds of waste, while with sound, ripe, perfectly fresh\r\nfruit, it is entirely practical to secure from 1,600 to 1,800 pounds of\r\ncanned goods from a ton, and this saving in waste would more than\r\ncounterbalance the gain from the use of the better machinery possible in\r\nthe factory.\r\n\r\n=The process of canning= is simple and consists first of rinsing off the\r\nfruit, then in wire baskets or pails dipping it into boiling hot water\r\nto start the skins, which will require but two to four minutes. While\r\nthey are still hot they should be peeled and imperfections cut out,\r\nthen promptly placed in the cans, which should be fully filled; it is\r\nwell to do this by adding the juice which has escaped while peeling,\r\ninstead of water, as is done in the larger factories. This will give the\r\ncanned fruit better color and lessen the need of dye. Place in a hot box\r\nfor three to five minutes until heated through, wipe top of can clean\r\nand drop perforated cap in place, add flux and solder, seal cap in place\r\nwith round capper, close perforation in cap with drop of solder. Place\r\nin box or kettle and steam or boil for 20 to 40 minutes. If the tomatoes\r\nwere all ripe and none over-ripe, and have been kept hot from the time\r\nthey went into the scalding kettle until the sealed cans are in the\r\nkettle, 20 minutes' cooking will make them surer to keep than 40 minutes\r\nwould with fruit such as is commonly received at factories, or that\r\nwhich has been allowed to cool once or twice while in process.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nCost of Production\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are a few vegetables or fruits where the cost of production and\r\nthe price received are more variable than with the tomato. The cost per\r\nacre for raising the fruit varies with the conditions of soil,\r\nfacilities for doing the work economically and with the season, while\r\nthat of marketing the product varies still more. Under usual conditions,\r\nthe growing of an acre of tomatoes and the gathering and marketing of\r\nthe fruit will cost from $18 to $90, of which from 15 to 40 per cent. is\r\nspent in fertilizing and preparing the ground, 5 to 10 per cent. for\r\nplants, 20 to 30 per cent. for cultivation, and 25 to 40 per cent. for\r\ngathering and handling the fruit. The last item, of course, varies\r\nsomewhat with, but not in proportion to, the amount of the crop, as it\r\ncosts proportionately less to gather a large than a small crop, and for\r\ncanners' use than for market.\r\n\r\nThe expense of shipping and marketing the crop varies so greatly\r\naccording to the conditions and methods that I do not attempt to state\r\nthe amount. The total yield of fruit runs from 200 to 600 or 700 bushels\r\nto the acre, a 200-bushel crop of tomatoes comparing as to amount with\r\none of 25 bushels of wheat and a 700-bushel crop of tomatoes with one of\r\n60 bushels of wheat; with the best and wisest cultivation and under the\r\nmost favorable conditions one can as reasonably hope for one as for the\r\nother. Of this total yield, from 10 to 25 per cent. of the fruit should\r\nbe such as, because of earliness and quality, can be sold as extras, and\r\nthere is usually from 5 to 10 per cent., and sometimes a much larger per\r\ncent., which should be rejected as unsalable. The selected fruit should\r\nnet from $1 to $5 a bushel, the common from 30 to 75 cents--making the\r\nreturns for a 200-bushel yield well sold in a nearby market $70 to $350,\r\nand proportionately larger, for a better yield. In practice I have known\r\nof crops which gave a profit above expenses of over $1,000 an acre. This\r\ncame, however, from exceptionally favorable conditions and skilled\r\nmarketing, and I have known of many more crops where, though the fruit\r\nwas equally large and well grown, the profit was less than $100.\r\n\r\nIn this country a greenhouse is seldom used solely for the growing of\r\ntomatoes, but other crops--such as lettuce--are grown in connection with\r\nthe tomatoes, so that it is impracticable to give the cost of\r\nproduction. As grown at the Ohio state experiment station--and the crop\r\nripened in late spring or early summer and sold on the market of smaller\r\ncities--greenhouse tomatoes have yielded about two pounds a square foot\r\nof glass and brought an average price of 12 cents per pound. In other\r\ncases yields as high as 10 pounds a foot of glass and an average price\r\nof 40 cents a pound have been reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nInsects Injurious to the Tomato\r\n\r\n    By DR. F. H. CHITTENDEN\r\n    Bureau of Entomology, U. S. Department of Agriculture\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time tomato plants are set in the field until the fruit has\r\nripened they are subject to the attacks of insects which frequently\r\ncause serious injury. On the whole, however, the tomato is not so\r\nsusceptible to damage as are some related crops--such as the potato.\r\n\r\n=Cutworms.=--Of insects most to be feared and of those which attack the\r\nplants when they are first set out are cutworms of various species. The\r\ngrower is as a rule quite too familiar with these insects, and no\r\ndescription of their methods is necessary, beyond the statement that\r\nthey cut off and destroy more than they eat and re-setting is frequently\r\nnecessary. The best remedy is a poisoned bait, prepared by dipping\r\nbunches of clover, weeds, or other vegetation in a solution of Paris\r\ngreen or other arsenical, 1 pound to 100 gallons of water. These baits\r\nare distributed in small lots over the ground _before_ the plants are\r\nset, the precaution being observed that the land is free for two or\r\nthree weeks from any form of vegetation. This will force the hungry\r\n\"worms\" to feed on the baits, to their prompt destruction. A bran-mash\r\nis also used instead of weeds or clover, and is prepared by combining\r\none part by weight of arsenic, one of sugar, and six of sweetened bran,\r\nwith enough water added to make a mash. The baits are renewed if they\r\nbecome too dry, or they can be kept moist by placing them under shingles\r\nor pieces of board.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35--CUTWORM AND PARENT MOTH (_Feltia subgothica_)\r\n(From Chittenden, U. S. Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\n=Flea-beetles= attack the plants soon after they are set, and their\r\ninjuries can be prevented by dipping the young plants before setting in\r\na solution of arsenate of lead, about 1 pound to 50 gallons of water, or\r\nParis green, 1 pound to 100 gallons. If this precaution has not been\r\nobserved a spray of either of these arsenicals used in the proportion\r\nspecified will suffice, repeating if the insects continue on the plants.\r\nIn the preparation of the spray a pound of fresh lime to each pound of\r\nthe arsenical should be added; or, better yet, Bordeaux mixture should\r\nbe employed as a diluent instead of water. This mixture has some\r\ninsecticidal value, is a most valuable fungicide, and is also a\r\npowerful deterrent of flea-beetle attack, acting to a less degree\r\nagainst other insects which are apt to be found on the tomato. In\r\napplying any spray a sprayer costing not less than $7 is a positive\r\nnecessity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36--FLEA-BEETLE Does great injury to young plants.\r\nMuch enlarged. Actual size shown by line at right. (From Chittenden)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37--MARGINED BLISTER BEETLE (From Chittenden)]\r\n\r\n=The Colorado potato beetle=, or \"potato bug,\" sometimes injures\r\ntomatoes, but not as a rule when potatoes are available. This suggests\r\nthe use of potatoes as a trap crop, planted in about three rows\r\ncompletely around the field of tomatoes. The arsenicals used in the same\r\nproportion as for flea-beetles will destroy the potato beetle. It is\r\nnecessary to keep the trap potatoes well sprayed to prevent them from\r\nbreeding on these plants and migrating to the tomatoes. Potato beetles\r\ncan also be controlled by jarring them from the affected plants into\r\nlarge pans containing a little water on which a thin scum of kerosene is\r\nfloating.\r\n\r\n=Blister beetles= may be controlled, under ordinary circumstances, by\r\nthe same method employed against the Colorado beetle. When they are\r\npresent in great numbers a good remedy consists in driving them with the\r\nwind from the cultivated fields into windrows of straw or similar dry\r\nmaterial previously prepared along the leeward side of the field, where\r\nthey will congregate and can be burned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38--TOMATO WORM (_Protoparce sexta_) (_a_) Adult\r\nmoth; (_b_) full-grown larva; (_c_) pupa--all reduced. (After Howard, U.\r\nS. Dept. Agr.)]\r\n\r\n=The tomato worms=, of which there are two common species closely\r\nresembling each other, are often abundant and destructive on tomato\r\nfoliage, particularly southward. The arsenicals will kill them, or they\r\ncan be held in check by hand-picking, a little experience enabling one\r\nto detect their presence readily. Turkeys are utilized in destroying\r\nthese worms in the South.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39--TOMATO STALK-BORER (_Papaipema nitela_)\r\n(_a_) Female moth; (_b_) half-grown larva; (_c_) mature larva in injured\r\nstalk; (_d_) lateral view of abdominal segment; (_e_) pupa--all somewhat\r\nenlarged. (From Chittenden, U. S. Dept. Agr.)]\r\n\r\n=The stalk-borer=, as its name implies, attacks the stalk, and is an\r\nintermittent pest, though quite annoying at times. It is difficult to\r\ncombat, but its injuries may be prevented by care in keeping down, and\r\nby _promptly_ destroying, the weeds after they are pulled or hoed out\r\nduring the growing season. If weeds are left to dry the striped\r\ncaterpillar of this species will desert them and enter cultivated\r\nplants. Ragweed and burdock are the principal foods of this insect, and\r\nspecial attention should be given to eradicate them where tomatoes are\r\nplanted. Crop rotation is advisable where this can be conveniently\r\npracticed, and such plants as cabbage, radish and the like, onions,\r\nbeets, asparagus and celery are suggested as alternates. When the plants\r\nare sprayed with arsenicals for other insects this will operate to a\r\ncertain extent against the stalk-borer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40--CHARACTERISTIC WORK OF THE TOMATO FRUIT WORM\r\n(_Heliothis obsoleta_) (Redrawn by Johnson from C. V. Riley)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41--ADULT MOTH, OR PARENT OF TOMATO FRUIT WORM\r\n(From Chittenden, U. S. Department of Agriculture)]\r\n\r\n=The tomato fruit worm= (Fig. 40) known as the bollworm of cotton and the\r\near worm of corn, is frequently the cause of serious trouble to tomato\r\ngrowers, especially in the southern states, due to its pernicious habit\r\nof eating into and destroying the green and ripening fruit. For its\r\ncontrol it is advisable not to plant tomatoes in proximity to old corn\r\nor cotton fields, nor should land be used in regions where this species\r\nis abundant until it has been fall or winter plowed. Sweet corn planted\r\nabout the field before the tomatoes are set will serve as a lure for the\r\nparent moths to deposit their eggs, corn and cotton being favorite foods\r\nof this species and preferred to tomatoes. The fruit worm feeds to a\r\ncertain extent on the foliage before penetrating the fruit, and it is\r\npossible to keep it in subjection by spraying with arsenicals as advised\r\nfor the flea-beetles. It is suggested that arsenate of lead, being more\r\nadhesive than other arsenicals, should be used for the first sprayings,\r\nbeginning when the fruit commences to form, repeating once or twice as\r\nfound necessary, and making a last spraying with Paris green within a\r\nfew days of ripening. This last poison will readily wash off and there\r\nis no danger whatever of poisoning to human beings, as has been\r\nconclusively proved in numerous similar cases. For the perfect success\r\nof this remedy the last spraying is essential, as those who have\r\nsprayed with an arsenical and have reported only partial good results\r\nhave discontinued within about two weeks of the time of the ripening of\r\nthe first fruit.\r\n\r\n=White fly or aleyrodes.=--These minute insects are familiar to most\r\ngrowers who raise tomatoes under glass. They can be held in control by\r\nvaporization or fumigation with tobacco or nicotine extracts, or by\r\nspraying with kerosene emulsion or the so-called whale-oil (fish-oil)\r\nsoap. Care is necessary in using the extracts that the smudge does not\r\nbecome too dense and injure the plants. Before applying this remedy on a\r\nlarge scale a preliminary trial should be made following the directions\r\non the packages, and reducing the amount if any ill results follow.\r\nHydrocyanic acid gas, properly used, is also an excellent remedy for\r\naleyrodes, aphides, \"mealy-bug,\" and other soft-bodied insects which are\r\nsometimes troublesome on greenhouse tomatoes.\r\n\r\n    For a complete account of the methods of making and handling\r\n    hydrocyanic acid gas, see Professor Johnson's book entitled\r\n    \"Fumigation Methods,\" published by Orange Judd Company, of New\r\n    York.

Department of Agriculture\r\n\r\nDISEASES NOT CAUSED BY FUNGI OR INSECTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe health of tomato plants is to a large extent dependent on the\r\nconditions under which they are being grown. The character and physical\r\ncondition of the soil, the supply of water and plant food, the\r\ntemperature and amount of sunlight, are all factors of the greatest\r\nimportance in the growth and development of the crop. When there are\r\nvariations from the normal in the case of any of these the plant adapts\r\nitself to the change as far as possible, but its functions may be so\r\ndisturbed as to result in ill health or disease. It is in many cases\r\ndifficult to draw a line between a natural re-action of the plant to its\r\nenvironment and a state of disease. For example, the trouble described\r\nin the next paragraph seems to fall into the first class.\r\n\r\n=Shedding of blossoms.=--The tomato is very liable to drop its buds and\r\nblossoms and in some instances partial or total crop failures have\r\nresulted. The principal causes are an over-rapid growth, due in many\r\ncases to an excess of nitrogenous fertilizers, unfavorable weather\r\nconditions, especially cold winds, continued rainy or moist weather,\r\nwhich hinders pollination, lack of sunlight, or extremely hot weather.\r\nSuch shedding can be partially controlled by pruning away the lateral\r\nbranches as soon as formed and topping the plants after the third\r\ncluster of fruit has set, and by a reduction in the use of nitrogenous\r\nfertilizers. A failure to set fruit in the greenhouse is often due to\r\nlack of pollination, which must be remedied by hand pollination.\r\n\r\n=Cracking of the fruit.=--The formation of cracks or fissures in the\r\nnearly mature fruit is due to variations in the water supply and other\r\nconditions affecting growth at this stage. If after the development of\r\nthe outer portion of the fruit has been checked by drought there follows\r\na period of abundant water supply and rapid growth, the fruit expands\r\nmore rapidly than its epidermis and the latter is ruptured. Some\r\nvarieties of tomatoes are much less subject to this trouble than others\r\nand should be given preference on this account. The grower, so far as\r\nlies in his power, should seek to maintain an uninterrupted growth by\r\nthorough preparation of the land, by cultivation or by mulching. If the\r\nhalf-grown fruits are enclosed in paper bags, cracking may be prevented,\r\nbut at the risk of loss of flavor in the ripened fruit.\r\n\r\n=Leaf curl.=--The effect of pruning is to stimulate growth and to\r\nincrease the size of the leaves, the effort of the plant being to\r\nmaintain a balance between roots and foliage. With rapidly growing\r\nplants, especially in the greenhouse and garden where both high manuring\r\nand pruning have been practiced, more or less curling and distortion of\r\nthe leaves may result without developing into serious trouble if the\r\ngrower takes the hint and modifies his methods so as to permit a more\r\nbalanced growth. On the other hand, the ill effects of over-feeding and\r\npruning may reach a point where the plant is seriously crippled.\r\n\r\n=Edema.=--Under certain conditions plants in greenhouses or even in the\r\nopen field, may absorb water through the roots faster than it can be\r\ntranspired through the leaves, with the result that dropsical swellings\r\nor blisters occur on the leaves and more succulent stems. There is also\r\na deformation of the foliage, much like the leaf-curl produced by\r\nover-feeding. This trouble, known as edema, occurs when the soil is\r\nwarmer than the air, or during periods of moist, warm, cloudy weather,\r\nwhich checks transpiration. The grower should cease pruning, and\r\nwithhold water, and in the field cultivate deeply. In the greenhouse,\r\nadequate ventilation should be given, keeping the house dry rather than\r\nmoist.\r\n\r\n=Mosaic disease.=--The tomato is occasionally subject to a trouble allied\r\nto the mosaic disease of tobacco. It is characterized by a variegation\r\nof the leaves into light and dark green areas, usually accompanied by\r\ndistortion and reduction in size. In severe cases a whole field may\r\nbecome worthless. While the nature of this malady is not fully\r\nunderstood, it is known to be due to a disordered nutrition of the young\r\nleaf-cells. It can be produced by severe pruning or by mutilation of the\r\nroots in transplanting, both of which should be carefully avoided. It is\r\nmore likely to occur in seedlings that have made a soft, rapid growth on\r\naccount of an excess of nitrogenous fertilizer or too high temperature.\r\nClose, clayey soils, on account of their poor physical condition, also\r\nfavor the development of the disease after transplanting.\r\n\r\n=Western blight (Yellows).=--In the North Pacific and Rocky Mountain\r\nstates, serious losses are annually caused by a disease apparently\r\nunlike any eastern trouble. It is marked by a gradual yellowing of the\r\nfoliage and fruit. Development is checked, the leaves curl upward and\r\nthe plant dies without wilting. The nature and cause of this disease is\r\nas yet unknown. It appears to be worst on new land. Experiments that\r\nhave been made indicate that in older cultivated fields thorough\r\npreparation of the soil, manuring and cultivation, combined with care in\r\ntransplanting to avoid injuring the roots and checking growth, will\r\ngreatly restrict the spread of this blight.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES CAUSED BY PARASITES\r\n\r\nThere are several fungous parasites of tomatoes, which, for the readers\r\nconvenience, may be briefly mentioned and the treatment of all discussed\r\ntogether. The first three are indeed somewhat difficult to tell apart\r\nwithout a microscope, as they produce a similar effect on the leaves and\r\nall yield to the same treatment--thorough spraying with Bordeaux\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\n=Leaf spot= (_Septoria lycopersici_ Speg.) has been widely prevalent and\r\ninjurious during recent years. It produces small, roundish dark-brown\r\nspots on leaves and stems. The lower leaves are attacked first and\r\ngradually curl up, die and fall off. The vitality of the plant is\r\nreduced and it is only kept alive by the young leaves formed at the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nThe fungus that causes early blight of potatoes (_Alternaria solani_ (E.\r\n& M.) J. & G.) occurs on tomatoes also, sometimes doing much injury. The\r\nspots formed are at first small and black, later enlarging and\r\nexhibiting fine concentric rings.\r\n\r\nA somewhat similar leaf-blight results from a species of\r\n_Cylindrosporium_, and other fungi may occur on diseased leaves.\r\n\r\n=Leaf mold= (_Cladosporium fulvum_ Cke.) is quite distinct from the\r\nforegoing in appearance. It does not cause such distinct spots but\r\noccurs in greenish brown, velvety patches of irregular outline on the\r\nunder side of the leaves. The lower leaves are first attacked, and as\r\nthe disease progresses they turn yellow and drop off. This is the\r\nprincipal fungous enemy of greenhouse tomatoes, but also does injury in\r\ngardens, particularly in Florida and the Gulf region. It is readily\r\ncontrolled by spraying. In the greenhouse care should be taken to\r\nventilate well, without, however, allowing cold drafts to strike the\r\nplants.\r\n\r\n=Downy mildew= (_Phytopthora infestans_ DeBy.), the cause of the late\r\nblight of potatoes, will attack tomatoes during cool and very moist\r\nweather, which greatly favors its development. Such outbreaks sometimes\r\noccur to a limited extent in New England and serious losses are reported\r\non the winter crop in southern California, but the disease has never\r\nbeen troublesome in other sections of the country, as it cannot develop\r\nin dry or hot weather. It affects the tomato as it does the potato,\r\nforming on the leaves dark, discolored spots, which spread rapidly under\r\nfavorable conditions, killing the foliage in a few days. The fruit is\r\nalso attacked and becomes covered with the mildew-like spore-bearing\r\nthreads of the fungus. Bordeaux mixture properly applied is an efficient\r\npreventive.\r\n\r\n=Spraying tomatoes.=--It should be the invariable practice of the tomato\r\ngrower to spray with Bordeaux mixture to prevent injury from any of\r\nthese leaf-blights. This should be done while the plants are still\r\nhealthy, as if put off until the disease appears the battle is half\r\nlost. Make the first application to the young plants in the seed-bed a\r\nfew days before transplanting. Spray again within a week after the\r\nplants are set in the field, and repeat at intervals of ten days or two\r\nweeks until the fruit is full grown. Success in spraying depends mainly\r\non the thoroughness of the work. The aim should be to cover every leaf\r\nwith a fine mist. Do not drench the foliage but pass to the next plant\r\nbefore the drops run together and off the leaf. Use a nozzle that gives\r\na fine spray and maintain a high pressure at the pump.\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Bordeaux mixture._--Formula: Copper sulphate\r\n(bluestone), 5 pounds; lime, 5 pounds; and water, 50 gallons. The copper\r\nsulphate may be either in crystals or pulverized. Dissolve by suspending\r\nthe required amount in a coarse sack near the top of the water a few\r\nhours before it will be needed. The lime must be fresh stone lime of\r\ngood quality. Slake thoroughly by the addition of small quantities of\r\nwater at a time as needed, stirring until all small lumps are slaked.\r\nStrain both the lime milk and the copper sulphate or bluestone solution\r\nthrough a brass strainer of 18 meshes per inch and dilute each with half\r\nthe water before mixing together. Do not use Bordeaux left over from\r\nthe previous day. An old mixture or one made from the concentrated\r\nsolutions has a poor physical condition. It settles more quickly, tends\r\nto clog the nozzle and does not adhere so well to the foliage. Failure\r\nto use the strainer results in endless trouble in the field from clogged\r\nnozzles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42--PROPER WAY TO MAKE BORDEAUX (From W. G.\r\nJohnson)]\r\n\r\nWhen much spraying is to be done it is more convenient to keep the\r\nbluestone and lime in separate permanent stock solutions, as shown in\r\nFig. 42, containing 2 pounds to the gallon of their respective\r\ningredients. These will keep indefinitely, if the water evaporated is\r\nreplaced, and may be used from as needed.\r\n\r\n_Spraying apparatus._--Tomato growers having only a small area to spray\r\nmay use one of the numerous forms of hand-pumps or bucket sprayers now\r\non the market. For larger fields it will be necessary to employ a\r\nbarrel sprayer. This consists of a hand-pump mounted in a barrel or tank\r\nand equipped with two leads of 3/8 inch hose 25 feet long, each with a\r\nfour-foot, extension made from 1/4 inch gas pipe, and a double Vermorel\r\nnozzle. The barrel should be carried in an ordinary farm wagon. Three\r\nmen do the work. One is expected to drive and pump, while the other two\r\nmanipulate the nozzles. The outfit is stopped while the plants within\r\nreach are sprayed, then driven forward about 30 feet and stopped again.\r\nOn an average in actual field practice 3 to 4 acres a day can be sprayed\r\nin this way, applying 100 to 200 gallons of Bordeaux per acre. To keep\r\nthe long hose off the plants two poles about 10 feet long may be pivoted\r\nto the bed of the wagon so as to swing at an angle over the wheel and\r\ncarry the hose. The pump for this outfit should be of good capacity,\r\nwith brass valves. A \"Y\" shut-off discharge connection on the pump is a\r\nconvenience for stopping the spray at any time. The most satisfactory\r\nnozzles are those of the Vermorel type. It is cheapest in the long run\r\nto buy the best grades of pumps on the market. This outfit is\r\nexcellently adapted for spraying small fields of potatoes and for\r\ngeneral orchard work, and is invaluable on the average farm.\r\n\r\n=Phytoptosis.=--This disease is known to occur only in Florida, where it\r\nis sometimes common enough to require remedial treatment. The affected\r\nportions of the foliage are more or less distorted and covered with an\r\nashy white fuzz. The general vigor and fruitfulness of the plants are\r\ngreatly reduced. The name applied to this trouble denotes its cause, an\r\nextremely small mite (_Phytoptus calacladophora_ Nal.), which by its\r\npresence on the leaves or stems so irritates them as to result in the\r\nabundant development of modified plant hairs, which shelter the mites\r\nand form the fuzzy covering characteristic of the disease. A remedy for\r\nphytoptosis is available in the sulphur compounds. The following one is\r\nparticularly recommended by Prof. P. H. Rolfs, to whom our knowledge of\r\nthe disease is due:\r\n\r\n_Preparation of sulphur spray._--Place 30 pounds of flowers of sulphur\r\nin a wooden tub large enough to hold 25 gallons. Wet the sulphur with 3\r\ngallons of water, stir it to form a paste. Then add 20 pounds of 98 per\r\ncent. caustic soda (28 pounds should be used if the caustic soda is 70\r\nper cent.) and mix it with the sulphur paste. In a few minutes it\r\nbecomes very hot, turns brown, and becomes a liquid. Stir thoroughly and\r\nadd enough water to make 20 gallons. Pour off from the sediment and keep\r\nthe liquid as a stock solution in a tight barrel or keg. Of this\r\nsolution use 4 quarts to 50 gallons of water. Apply with a spray pump\r\nwhenever the disease appears, and repeat if required by its later\r\nreappearance. The use of dry sulphur is also recommended.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE FRUIT\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43--POINT-ROT DISEASE OF THE TOMATO (Redrawn from\r\nN. Y. Expr. Sta. No. 125)]\r\n\r\n=Point-rot.=--This trouble, called also \"blossom-end rot,\" and\r\n\"black-rot,\" occurs on the green fruit at various stages of development,\r\nas shown in Fig. 43. It begins at the blossom end as a sunken brown\r\nspot, which gradually enlarges until the fruit is rendered worthless.\r\nThe decayed spot is often covered in its later stages by a dense black\r\nfungous growth (_Alternaria fasciculata_ (C. & E.) J. & G. syn.\r\n_Macrosporium tomato_ Cke.), formerly thought to be the cause of the\r\nrot, but now known to be merely a saprophyte. Point-rot sometimes occurs\r\nin greenhouses, but is more common in field culture. It is one of the\r\nmost destructive diseases of the tomato, but its nature is not fully\r\nworked out, and a uniformly successful treatment is unknown. It has been\r\nthought to be due to bacterial invasion, but complete demonstrations of\r\nthat fact have not yet been published. The physiological conditions of\r\nthe plant appear to be important. The disease is worst in dry weather\r\nand light soils, where the moisture supply is insufficient, and\r\nirrigation is beneficial in such cases. Spraying does not control\r\npoint-rot so far as present evidence goes.\r\n\r\n=Anthracnose--ripe-rot=--(_Colletotrichum phomoides_ (Sacc.) Chest.), is\r\ndistinguished from the point-rot by the fact that it occurs mainly on\r\nripe or nearly ripe fruits, producing a soft and rapid decay. Widespread\r\nlosses from this cause are not common, but when a field becomes infected\r\na considerable proportion of the crop within a limited area may be\r\ndestroyed if humid or rainy weather prevails. Preventive measures only\r\ncan be employed. These should consist in collecting and destroying\r\ndiseased fruit and in staking and trimming the vines to admit light and\r\nair to dry out the foliage. Bordeaux mixture applied after the\r\ndevelopment of the disease would be of doubtful efficiency and would be\r\nobjectionable on account of the sediment left on the ripe fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES OF THE ROOT OR STEM\r\n\r\n=Damping off.=--Young plants in seed-beds often perish suddenly from a\r\nrot of the stem at the surface of the ground. This occurs as a rule in\r\ndull, cloudy weather among plants kept at too high a temperature,\r\ncrowded too closely in the beds or not sufficiently ventilated. Several\r\nkinds of fungi are capable of causing damping off, under such\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n_Preventive measures_ are of the first importance. Since old soil is\r\noften full of fungous spores left by previous crops, it is the wisest\r\nplan to use sterilized soil for the seed-bed. When the young plants are\r\ngrowing, constant watchfulness is required to avoid conditions that will\r\nweaken the seedlings and favor the damping off fungi.\r\n\r\n_Watering and ventilation_ are the two points that require especial\r\nskill. Watering should be done at midday, to allow the beds to drain\r\nbefore night, and only enough water for the thorough moistening of the\r\nsoil should be applied. Ventilation should be given every warm day as\r\nthe temperature and sunshine will permit, but the plants must be\r\nprotected from rain and cold winds. Work the surface of the soil to\r\npermit aeration and do not crowd the plants too closely in the beds. If\r\ndamping off develops something can be done to check it by scattering a\r\nlayer of dry, warm sand over the surface, and by spraying the bed\r\nthoroughly with weak Bordeaux or by applying dry sulphur and air-slaked\r\nlime.\r\n\r\n=Bacterial wilt= (_Bacterium solanacearum_ Erw. Sm.).--This disease,\r\nwhich also attacks potatoes and eggplants and some related weeds, is one\r\nof the most serious enemies of the tomato. It is known to occur from\r\nConnecticut southward to Florida and westward to Colorado, but is most\r\nprevalent in the Gulf States, where it has greatly discouraged many\r\ngrowers.\r\n\r\n_Its most prominent symptoms_ are the wilting of the foliage and a\r\nbrowning of the wood inside the recently wilted stems. An affected plant\r\nwilts first at the top, or a single branch wilts, but later the entire\r\nplant yellows, wilts and dies. Young plants wilt more suddenly and dry\r\nup. The disease progresses more rapidly in plants that have made a\r\nsucculent, luxurious growth, while those with hard, woody stems resist\r\nit somewhat.\r\n\r\n_The disease is due_ to the invasion of bacteria, which enter the leaves\r\nthrough the aid of leaf-eating insects, or through the roots. They plug\r\nthe water-carrying vessels of the stem, shutting off the water and food\r\nsupply of the plant. If the stem of a plant freshly wilted from this\r\ndisease be severed, the bacteria will ooze out in dirty white drops on\r\nthe cut surface.\r\n\r\n=Remedial measures= entirely satisfactory for the control of bacterial\r\nwilt have not yet been worked out. The best methods to adopt at present\r\nare the following:\r\n\r\n(1) _Rotation of crops._--The field evidence is that this disease is in\r\nmany cases localized in old gardens or in definite spots in the field.\r\nIt appears also that the infection left by a diseased crop can remain in\r\nthe soil for some time. It is therefore advised that tomato growers\r\nshould always practice a rotation of crops, whether any disease has\r\nappeared or not, and that in case bacterial wilt develops they should\r\nnot plant that land in tomatoes, potatoes, or eggplants for three or\r\nfour years. The length of rotation necessary to free the soil is not\r\nknown, but will have to be worked out by the individual grower.\r\n\r\n(2) _Destruction of diseased plants._--The bacteria causing wilt not\r\nonly spread through the soil but are carried by insects from freshly\r\nwilted to healthy plants. Diseased plants thus become dangerous sources\r\nof infection, and it is evident that all such should be pulled out and\r\nburned. This is particularly important at the beginning of the trouble\r\nwhen the eradication of a few wilting plants may save the remainder.\r\n\r\n(3) _Control of insects._--To lessen the danger from spread of wilt by\r\ninsects, the measures advised in the next chapter for the control of\r\nleaf-eating insects should be adopted. In this connection it should be\r\nmentioned that the use of Bordeaux mixture for leaf blights, as\r\npreviously recommended, has an additional value in that the coating on\r\nthe leaves is distasteful to insects and helps to keep them away.\r\n\r\n(4) _Seed selection._--Work done at the Florida experiment station\r\nindicates that resistant varieties may be secured, but there are as yet\r\nnone in commercial use. This is an important line for experimenters to\r\nfollow up. There is no proof that the disease is spread through seed\r\nfrom diseased plants.\r\n\r\n=Fusarium wilt.=--This disease and the one following resemble the\r\nbacterial wilt so closely, as far as external characters go, that they\r\nare difficult to tell apart. The parasites, however, differ so\r\nmaterially in their nature and life history that the field treatment is\r\nquite different. There are also differences in geographical distribution\r\nthat are important, for while the Fusarium wilt occurs occasionally\r\nthroughout the southern states, it is known to be of general commercial\r\nimportance only in southern Florida and southern California.\r\n\r\n_The symptoms of the disease_ are a gradual wilting and dying of the\r\nplants, usually in the later stages of their development. Young plants\r\ndie, however, when the soil infection is severe. There is a browning of\r\nthe woody portions of the stem, and when a section of this is examined\r\nunder a compound microscope the vessels are found to be filled with\r\nfungous threads, which shut off the water supply.\r\n\r\n_The infection_ in the Fusarium wilt appears to come entirely from the\r\nsoil. Little is known of its manner of spread, except that the\r\ncultivation of a tomato crop in certain districts appears to leave the\r\nsoil infected so that a crop planted the next year will be injured or\r\ndestroyed. The fungus does not remain in the soil for a very long time\r\nin sufficient abundance to cause serious harm. A rotation of crops that\r\nwill bring tomatoes on the land once in three years has been found in\r\nFlorida to prevent loss from Fusarium wilt.\r\n\r\n_This fungus does not attack any other crop_ than tomatoes, so far as\r\nknown, though it is very closely related to species of Fusarium\r\nproducing similar diseases in cotton, melon, cowpea, flax, etc. Fusarium\r\nwilt has not been found in fields and gardens in the northern states,\r\nbut tomatoes in greenhouses there are sometimes attacked by it or a\r\nrelated Fusarium, which also occurs in England. When greenhouse beds are\r\ninfected the soil for the next crop should be thoroughly sterilized by\r\nsteam under pressure.\r\n\r\n=Sclerotium wilt.=--This disease resembles the two preceding in its\r\neffect on the plant, which wilts at the tip first, and gradually dies.\r\nIts geographical range is more restricted. It seems to be confined to\r\nnorthern Florida and the southern part of Georgia and Alabama, where it\r\noccurs in gardens and old cultivated fields. The fungus causing this\r\nwilt attacks the root and the stem near the ground, working in from the\r\noutside. There is not the browning of the wood vessels characteristic of\r\nthe two preceding diseases. If an affected stem is put in a moist\r\nchamber made from a covered or inverted dish, there will develop an\r\nexceedingly vigorous growth of snow-white fungous mycelium which, after\r\na few days, bears numerous round shot-like bodies, at first\r\nlight-colored, then becoming smaller and dark-brown. These are the\r\nsclerotia or resting bodies of the fungus. This fungus, called\r\n_Sclerotium_ sp., or \"Rolf's Sclerotium,\" is noteworthy because it\r\nattacks potatoes, squash, cowpea, and a long list of other garden\r\nvegetables and ornamental plants. The only satisfactory means of control\r\nis rotation of crops, using corn, small grain, and the Iron cowpea, a\r\nvariety immune to this and other diseases. Susceptible crops should be\r\nkept from infected fields for two or three years.\r\n\r\n=Root-knot= (_Heterodera radicicola_ (Greef) Mül.) attacks tomatoes in\r\ngreenhouses and is in some cases an important factor in southern field\r\nculture. It is caused by a parasitic eelworm or nematode, of minute\r\nsize, which penetrates the roots and induces the formation of numerous\r\nirregular swellings or galls, in which are bred great numbers of young\r\nworms. The effect on the plant is to check growth and diminish\r\nfruitfulness, in advanced cases even resulting in death.\r\n\r\n_The remedy in greenhouse culture_ is thorough soil sterilization. In\r\nthe open field this is impracticable and recourse must be had to a\r\nrotation with immune crops, which will starve out the root-knot. It must\r\nnow be borne in mind that the root-knot worm can attack cotton, cowpea,\r\nokra, melons and a very large number of other plants. The only common\r\ncrops safe to use in such a rotation in the South are corn, oats,\r\nvelvet beans, beggar weed, peanuts, and the Iron cowpea. The use of\r\nother varieties of cowpea than the Iron is particularly to be avoided,\r\non account of the danger of stocking the land with root-knot.\r\nFortunately, the disease is serious only in sandy or light soils.\r\n\r\n=Rosette= (_Corticium vagum_ (B. & C.) var. _solani_ Burt.) is a disease\r\nof minor importance, which occurs in Ohio, Michigan, and scatteringly in\r\nother states. The fungus causing it (_Rhizoctonia_) attacks the roots\r\nand base of the stem, forming dark cankers. The effect on the plant is\r\nto dwarf and curl the leaves and to restrict productiveness. The potato\r\nsuffers more severely from the same trouble. Rotation of crops and\r\nliberal application of lime to the soil are advised for the control of\r\nrosette in tomatoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PAGE\r\n\r\n
