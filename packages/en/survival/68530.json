In the main the sequence is that of the author’s\r\nevening discourse to the British Association at their meeting at\r\nWinnipeg in the summer of 1909. It is hoped, however, that the book\r\ncombines the advantages of sufficient amplification of the story there\r\ntold to make it an adequately detailed account of the development of the\r\nsubject, and of the immense progress which has been made in it during\r\nrecent years, with a full description of the numerous experimental\r\nillustrations given in the lecture, involving some of the most beautiful\r\nphenomena displayed by crystals in polarised light. Such an account has\r\nnot been otherwise published, the brief abstract appearing in the Report\r\nof the British Association for 1909 giving no account of the\r\nexperiments, which were a feature of the lecture, owing to the\r\nemployment of a fine projection polariscope of more or less novel\r\nconstruction, and including two magnificent large Nicol prisms, a pair\r\nof the original ones made by Ahrens. The author has been frequently\r\nrequested to publish a fuller account of this discourse, and as the\r\ngeneral plan of it so fully embodies the present aspect of this\r\nfascinating science, it was determined, when invited by the publishers\r\nto write a generally readable book on “Crystals,” to comply with these\r\nrequests.\r\n\r\nThere is also included an account of the remarkable work of Lehmann and\r\nhis fellow workers on “Liquid Crystals,” and the bearing of these\r\ndiscoveries on the nature of crystal structure is discussed in so far as\r\nthe experimental evidence has gone. Similarly, the theory of Pope and\r\nBarlow, connecting crystalline structure with the chemical property of\r\nvalency, is referred to and explained, as this theory has called forth\r\ndeep and widespread interest. In both cases, however, the author has\r\nbeen careful to avoid any expression of opinion on purely theoretical\r\nquestions for which there is as yet no definite experimental evidence,\r\nand has confined himself strictly to indicating how far such interesting\r\ntheories are supported by actual experimental facts.\r\n\r\nNo forbidding mathematical formulæ and no unessential technical terms\r\nwill be found in the book, the aim of the author being to make any\r\nordinarily cultured reader feel at the conclusion that the story has\r\nbeen readily comprehensible, and that crystallography is not the\r\nabstruse and excessively difficult subject which it has so generally\r\nbeen supposed to be, but that, on the contrary, it is both simple and\r\nstraightforward, and full of the most enthralling interest, as well for\r\nthe exquisite phenomena with which it deals, as for the exceedingly\r\nimportant bearing which it has on the nature, both chemical and\r\nphysical, of solid matter.\r\n\r\nIf any of its readers should be so impressed with the value of work in\r\nthis domain of science as to be desirous of joining the very thin ranks\r\nof the few who are engaged in it, they will find a guide to practical\r\ngoniometry and to the experimental investigation of crystals in all its\r\nbranches and details, as well as the necessary theoretical help, in the\r\nauthor’s book on “Crystallography and Practical Crystal Measurement”\r\n(Macmillan & Co., 1911), and also an account of the author’s own\r\ncontributions to the subject in a monograph entitled “Crystalline\r\nStructure and Chemical Constitution” (Macmillan & Co., 1910).\r\n\r\n                                                        A.

Moreover, when a\r\ncrystal is broken, and then surrounded with this proper environment, it\r\ngrows much more rapidly at the broken part than elsewhere, repairing the\r\ndamage done in a very short space of time and soon presenting the\r\nappearance of a perfect crystal once more. In this respect it is quite\r\ncomparable with animal tissue, the wonderful recuperative power of which\r\nafter injury, exhibited by special growth at the injured spot, is often\r\na source of such marvel to us. Indeed, a crystal may be broken in half,\r\nand yet each half in a relatively very brief interval will grow into a\r\ncrystal as large as the original one again. The longevity and virility\r\nof the spores and seeds of the vegetable kingdom have been the themes of\r\nfrequent amazement, although many of the stories told of them have been\r\nunable to stand the test of strict investigation. The virility of a\r\ncrystal, however, is unchanged and permanent.\r\n\r\nA crystal of quartz, rock-crystal, for instance—detached, during the\r\ncourse of the disintegration of the granitic rock of which it had\r\noriginally formed an individual crystal, by the denuding influences at\r\nwork in nature thousands of years ago, subsequently knocked about the\r\nworld as a rounded sand grain, blown over deserts by the wind, its\r\ncorners rounded off by rude contact with its fellows, and subjected to\r\nevery variety of rough treatment—may eventually in our own day find\r\nitself in water containing in solution a small amount of the material of\r\nwhich quartz is composed, silicon dioxide SiO_{2}. No sooner is this\r\nfavourable environment for continuing its crystallisation presented to\r\nit, than, however old it may be, it begins to sprout and grow again. It\r\nbecomes surrounded in all probability by a beautiful coating of\r\ntransparent quartz, with exterior faces inclined at the exact angles of\r\nquartz, although no sign of exterior faces had hitherto persisted\r\nthrough all the stages of its varied adventures. Or it may grow chiefly\r\nat two or three especially favourable places, and in the course of a few\r\nweeks, under suitable conditions, at each place a perfect little quartz\r\ncrystal will radiate out from the sand grain, composed of a miniature\r\nhexagonal prism terminated by the well-known pyramid, really consisting\r\nof a pair of trigonal (rhombohedral) pyramids more or less equally\r\ndeveloped, and together producing an apparently hexagonal one. Four such\r\ngrains of sand, from which quartz crystals are growing, are shown in\r\nFig. 1, as they appear under a microscope magnifying about fifty\r\ndiameters. One of them shows a perfectly developed doubly terminated\r\ncrystal of quartz growing from the tip of a singly terminated one,\r\nattached to and growing directly out of the grain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 1.—Sand Grains with Quartz Crystals growing from them.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis marvellously everlasting power possessed by a crystal, of silent\r\nimperceptible growth, that is, of adding to its own regular structure\r\nfurther accretions of infinitesimal particles, the chemical molecules,\r\nof its own substance, is one of the strangest functions of solid matter,\r\nand one of the fundamental facts of science which is rarely realised,\r\ncompared with many of the more obvious phenomena of nature.\r\n\r\nA crystal in the ordinary sense of the word is solid matter in its most\r\nperfectly developed and organised form. It is composed of the chemical\r\nmolecules of some definitely constituted substance, which have been laid\r\ndown in orderly sequence, in accordance with a specific architectural\r\nplan peculiar to that particular chemical substance. The physical\r\nproperties of the latter are such that it assumes the solid form at the\r\nordinary temperature and pressure, leaving out of consideration for the\r\npresent the remarkable viscous and liquid substances which will be\r\nspecially dealt with in Chapter XVI. of this book, and which are\r\ncurrently known as “liquid crystals.” This term is not perhaps a very\r\nappropriate one. For the word “crystal” had much better be left to\r\nconvey the idea of rigidity of polyhedral form and internal structure,\r\nwhich is the very basis of crystal measurement.\r\n\r\nThe solid crystal may have been produced during the simple act of\r\ncongealment from the liquid state, on the cooling of the heated\r\nliquefied substance to the ordinary temperature. Sulphur, for instance,\r\nis well-known to crystallise in acicular crystals belonging to the\r\nmonoclinic system under such conditions, a characteristic crop being\r\nshown in Fig. 2 (Plate I.); they were formed within an earthenware\r\ncrucible in which the fusion had occurred, and became revealed on\r\npouring out the remainder of the liquid sulphur when the crystallisation\r\nhad proceeded through about one-half of the original amount of the\r\n“melt.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE I._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 2.—Monoclinic Acicular Crystals of Sulphur produced by\r\n    Solidification of Liquid.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 3.—Octahedral Crystals of Arsenious Oxide produced by\r\n    Condensation of Vapour.\r\n\r\n  CRYSTALS FORMED BY DIFFERENT PROCESSES.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE II._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 4.—Cubic Octahedral Crystals of Potash Alum growing from\r\n    Solution.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 10.—Micro-Chemical Crystals of Gypsum (Calcium Sulphate) produced\r\n    by Slow Precipitation (see p. 14).\r\n\r\n  CRYSTALS FORMED BY DIFFERENT PROCESSES.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOr the substance may be one which passes directly from the gaseous to\r\nthe solid condition, on the cooling of the vapour from a temperature\r\nhigher than the ordinary down to the latter, under atmospheric pressure.\r\nOxide of arsenic, As_{2}O_{3}, is a substance exhibiting this property\r\ncharacteristically, and Fig. 3 (Plate I.) is a reproduction of a\r\nphotograph of crystals of this substance thus produced. The white solid\r\noxide was heated in a short test tube over a Bunsen flame, and the\r\nvapour produced was allowed to condense on a microscope glass slip, and\r\nthe result examined under the microscope, using a 1½ inch objective.\r\nFig. 3 represents a characteristic field of the transparent octahedral\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\nOr again, the crystal may have been deposited from the state of solution\r\nin a solvent, in which case it is a question of the passage of the\r\nsubstance from the liquid to the solid condition, complicated by the\r\npresence of the molecules of the solvent, from which the molecules of\r\nthe crystallising solid have to effect their escape. Fig. 4 (Plate II.)\r\nrepresents crystals of potash alum, for instance, growing from a drop of\r\nsaturated solution on a glass slip placed on the stage of the\r\nmicroscope, the drop being spread within a hard ring of gold size and\r\nunder a cover-glass, in order to prevent rapid evaporation and avoid\r\napparent distortion by the curvature of an uncovered drop. The crystals\r\nare of octahedral habit like those of oxide of arsenic, but many of them\r\nalso exhibit the faces of the cube.\r\n\r\nIn any case, however it may be erected, the crystal edifice is produced\r\nby the regular accretion of molecule on molecule, like the bricks or\r\nstone blocks of the builder, and in accordance with an architectural\r\nplan more elaborate and exact than that of any human architect. This\r\nplan is that of one of the thirty-two classes into which crystals can be\r\nnaturally divided with respect to their symmetry. Which specific one is\r\ndeveloped, and its angular dimensions, are traits characteristic of the\r\nsubstance. The thirty-two classes of crystals may be grouped in seven\r\ndistinctive systems, the seven styles of crystal architecture, each\r\ndistinguished by its own elements of symmetry.\r\n\r\nA crystal possesses two further fundamental properties besides its style\r\nof architecture. The first is that it is bounded externally by plane\r\nfaces, arranged on the definite geometrical plan just alluded to and\r\nmutually inclined at angles which are peculiar to the substance, and\r\nwhich are, therefore, absolutely constant for the same temperature and\r\npressure. The second is that a crystal is essentially a homogeneous\r\nsolid, its internal structure being similar throughout, in such wise\r\nthat the arrangement about any one molecule is the same as about every\r\nother. This structure is, in fact, that of one of the 230 homogeneous\r\nstructures ascertained by geometricians to be possible to crystals with\r\nplane faces. The first property, that of the planeness of the crystal\r\nfaces, and their arrangement with geometrical symmetry, is actually\r\ndetermined by the second, that of specific homogeneity. For, as with\r\nhuman nature developed to its highest type, the external appearance is\r\nbut the expression of the internal character.\r\n\r\nWhen nature has been permitted to have fair play, and the crystal has\r\nbeen deposited under ideal conditions, the planeness of its faces is\r\nastonishingly absolute. It is fully equal to that attained by the most\r\nskilled opticians after weeks of patient labour, in the production of\r\nsurfaces on glass or other materials suitable for such delicate optical\r\nexperiments as interference-band production, in which a distortion equal\r\nto one wave-length of light would be fatal. In all such cases of ideal\r\ndeposition, those interfacial angles on the crystal which the particular\r\nsymmetry developed requires to be equal actually are so, to this same\r\nhigh degree of refinement. This fact renders possible exceedingly\r\naccurate crystal measurement, that is, the determination of the angles\r\nof inclination of the faces to each other, provided refined measuring\r\ninstruments (goniometers), pure chemical substances, and the means of\r\navoiding disturbance, either material or thermal, during the deposition\r\nof the crystal, are available.\r\n\r\nThe study of crystals naturally divides itself into two more or less\r\ndistinct but mutually very helpful branches, and equally intimately\r\nconnected with the internal structure of crystals, namely, one which\r\nconcerns their exterior configuration and the structural morphology of\r\nwhich it is the eloquent visible expression, and another which relates\r\nto their optical characters. For the latter are so definitely different\r\nfor the different systems of crystal symmetry that they afford the\r\ngreatest possible help in determining the former, and give the casting\r\nvote in all cases of doubt left after the morphological investigation\r\nwith the goniometer. It is, of course, their brilliant reflection and\r\nrefraction of light, with production of numerous scintillations of\r\nreflected white light and of refracted coloured spectra, which endows\r\nthe hard and transparent mineral crystals, known from time immemorial as\r\ngem-stones, with their attractive beauty. Indeed, their outer natural\r\nfaces are frequently, and unfortunately usually, cut away most\r\nsacrilegiously by the lapidary, in order that by grinding and polishing\r\non them still more numerous and evenly distributed facets he may\r\nincrease to the maximum the magnificent play of coloured light with\r\nwhich they sparkle.\r\n\r\nAn interesting and very beautiful lecture experiment was performed by\r\nthe author in a lecture a few years ago at the Royal Institution, which\r\nillustrated in a striking manner this fact that the light reaching the\r\neye from a crystal is of two kinds, namely, white light reflected from\r\nthe exterior faces and coloured light which has penetrated the crystal\r\nsubstance and emerges refracted and dispersed as spectra. Two powerful\r\nbeams of light from a pair of widely separated electric lanterns were\r\nconcentrated on a cluster of magnificent large diamonds, kindly lent for\r\nthe purpose by Mr Edwin Streeter, and arranged in the shape of a crown,\r\nit being about the time of the Coronation of His late Majesty King\r\nEdward VII. The effect was not only to produce a blaze of colour about\r\nthe diamonds themselves, but also to project upon the ceiling of the\r\nlecture theatre numerous images in white light of the poles of the\r\nelectric arc, derived by reflection from the facets, interspersed with\r\nequally numerous coloured spectra derived from rays which had penetrated\r\nthe substance of the diamonds, and had suffered both refraction and\r\ninternal reflection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n    THE MASKING OF SIMILARITY OF SYMMETRY AND CONSTANCY OF ANGLE BY\r\n  DIFFERENCE OF HABIT, AND ITS INFLUENCE ON EARLY STUDIES OF CRYSTALS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 5.—Natural Rhombohedron of Iceland Spar with Subsidiary Faces.\r\n]\r\n\r\nNothing is more remarkable than the great variety of geometrical shapes\r\nwhich the crystals of the same substance, derived from different\r\nlocalities or produced under different conditions, are observed to\r\ndisplay. One of the commonest of minerals, calcite, carbonate of lime,\r\nshows this feature admirably; the beautiful large rhombohedra from\r\nIceland, illustrated in Fig. 5, or the hexagonal prisms capped by low\r\nrhombohedra from the Bigrigg mine at Egremont in Cumberland, shown in\r\nFig. 6, appear totally different from the “dog-tooth spar” so\r\nplentifully found all over the world, a specimen of which from the same\r\nmine is illustrated in Fig. 7. No mineral specimens could well appear\r\nmore dissimilar than these represented on Plate III. in Figs. 6 and 7,\r\nwhen seen side by side in the mineral gallery of the British Museum\r\n(Natural History) at South Kensington. But all are composed of similar\r\nchemical molecules of calcium carbonate, CaCO_{3}; and when the three\r\nkinds of crystals are investigated they are found to be identical in\r\ntheir crystalline system, the trigonal, and indeed further as to the\r\nsubdivision or class of that system, which has come to be called the\r\ncalcite class from the importance of this mineral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE III._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 6.—Hexagonal Prisms of Calcite terminated by Rhombohedra.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 7.—Scalenohedral Crystals of Calcite, “Dog-tooth Spar.”\r\n\r\n  CRYSTALS OF CALCITE FROM THE SAME MINE, ILLUSTRATING DIVERSITY OF\r\n    HABIT.\r\n\r\n  (Photographed from Specimens in the Natural History Department of the\r\n    British Museum, by kind permission.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nMoreover, many of the same faces, that is, faces having the same\r\nrelation to the symmetry, are present on all three varieties, the\r\n“forms” to which they equally belong being the common heritage of\r\ncalcite wherever found. A “form” is the technical term for a set of\r\nfaces having an equal value with respect to the symmetry. Thus the\r\nprismatic form in Fig. 6 is the hexagonal prism, a form which is common\r\nto the hexagonal and trigonal systems of symmetry, and the form\r\n“indices” (numbers[1] inversely proportional to the intercepts cut off\r\nfrom the crystal axes by the face typifying the form) of which are\r\n{2̄1̄1}; the large development of this form confers the elongated\r\nprismatic habit on the crystal. The terminations are faces of the flat\r\nrhombohedron {110}. The pyramidal form of the dog-tooth spar shown in\r\nFig. 7 is the scalenohedron {20̄1}, and it is this form which confers\r\nthe tooth-like habit, so different from the hexagonal prism, upon this\r\nvariety of calcite. But many specimens of dog-tooth spar, notably those\r\nfrom Derbyshire, consist of scalenohedra the middle portion of which is\r\nreplaced by faces of the hexagonal prism {2̄1̄1}, and the terminations\r\nof which are replaced by the characteristic rhombohedron {100} of\r\nIceland spar; indeed, it is quite common to find crystals of calcite\r\nexhibiting on the same individual all the forms which have been\r\nmentioned, that is, those dominating the three very differently\r\nappearing types. The author has quite recently measured such a crystal,\r\nwhich, besides showing all these four forms well developed, also\r\nexhibited the faces of two others of the well-known forms of calcite,\r\n{3̄1̄1} and {310}, and a reproduction of a drawing of it to scale is\r\ngiven in Fig. 8. Instead of indices the faces of each form bear a\r\ndistinctive letter; _m_ = {2̄1̄1}, _r_ = {100}, _e_ = {110}, _v_ =\r\n{20̄1} (the faces of the scalenohedron are of somewhat small dimensions\r\non this crystal), _n_ = {3̄1̄1}, and _t_ = {310}.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 8.—Measured Crystal of Calcite.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is obviously then the “habit” which is different in the three types\r\nof calcite—Iceland spar, prismatic calc-spar, and dog-tooth\r\nspar—doubtless owing to the different local circumstances of growth of\r\nthe mineral. Habit is simply the expression of the fact that a specific\r\n“form,” or possibly two particular forms, is or are much more\r\nprominently developed in one variety than in another. Thus the principal\r\nrhombohedron _r_ = {100}, parallel to the faces of which calcite cleaves\r\nso readily, is the predominating form in Iceland spar, while the\r\nscalenohedron _v_ = {20̄1} is the habit-conferring form in dog-tooth\r\nspar. Yet on the latter the rhombohedral faces are frequently developed,\r\nblunting the sharp terminations of the scalenohedra, especially in\r\ndog-tooth spar from Derbyshire or the Hartz mountains; and on the former\r\nminute faces of the scalenohedron are often found, provided the\r\nrhombohedron consists of the natural exterior faces of the crystal and\r\nnot of cleavage faces. In the same manner the prismatic crystals from\r\nEgremont are characterised by two forms, the hexagonal prism _m_ =\r\n{2̄1̄1} and the secondary rhombohedron _e_ = {110}, but both of these\r\nforms, as we have seen on the actual crystal represented in Fig. 8, are\r\nalso found developed on other crystals of mixed habit.\r\n\r\nThis illustration from the naturally occurring minerals might readily be\r\nsupplemented by almost any common artificial chemical preparation,\r\nsulphate of potash for instance, K_{2}SO_{4}, the orthorhombic crystals\r\nof which take the form of elongated prisms, even needles, on the one\r\nhand, or of tabular plate-like crystals on the other hand, according as\r\nthe salt crystallises by the cooling of a supersaturated solution, or by\r\nthe slow evaporation of a solution which at first is not quite\r\nsaturated. In both cases, and in all such cases, whether of minerals or\r\nchemical preparations, the same planes are present on the crystals of\r\nthe same substance, although all may not be developed on the same\r\nindividual except in a few cases of crystals particularly rich in faces;\r\nand these same planes are inclined at the same angles. But their\r\nrelative development may be so very unlike on different crystals as to\r\nconfer habits so very dissimilar that the fact of the identity of the\r\nsubstance is entirely concealed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 9.—Crystal of Gypsum.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA further example may perhaps be given, that of a substance, hydrated\r\nsulphate of lime, CaSO_{4}.2H_{2}O, which occurs in nature as the\r\nbeautiful transparent mineral gypsum or selenite—illustrated in Fig. 9,\r\nand which is found in monoclinic crystals often of very large size—and\r\nwhich may also be chemically prepared by adding a dilute solution of\r\nsulphuric acid to a very dilute solution of calcium chloride. The\r\nradiating groups of needles shown in Fig. 10 (Plate II.) slowly\r\ncrystallise out when a drop of the mixed solution is placed on a\r\nmicroscope slip and examined under the microscope, using the one-inch\r\nobjective. These needles, so absolutely different in appearance from a\r\ncrystal of selenite, are yet similar monoclinic prisms, but in which the\r\nprismatic form is enormously elongated compared with the other\r\n(terminating) form.\r\n\r\nThis difference of facial development, rendering the crystals of one and\r\nthe same substance from different sources so very unlike each other, was\r\napparently responsible for the very tardy discovery of the fundamental\r\nlaw of crystallography, the constancy of the crystal angles of the same\r\nsubstance. Gessner, sometime between the years 1560 and 1568, went so\r\nfar as to assert that not only are different crystals of the same\r\nsubstance of different sizes, but that also the mutual inclinations of\r\ntheir faces and their whole external form are dissimilar.\r\n\r\nWhat was much more obvious to the early students of crystals, and which\r\nis, in fact, the most striking thing about a crystal after its regular\r\ngeometric exterior shape, was the obviously homogeneous character of its\r\ninternal structure. So many crystals are transparent, and so clear and\r\nlimpid, that it was evident to the earliest observers that they were at\r\nleast as homogeneous throughout as glass, and yet that at the same time\r\nthey must be endowed with an internal structure the nature of which is\r\nthe cause of both the exterior geometric regularity of form, so\r\ndifferent from the irregular shape of a lump of glass, and of the\r\npeculiar effect on the rays of light which are transmitted through them.\r\nFrom the earliest ages of former civilisations the behaviour of crystals\r\nwith regard to light has been known to be different for the different\r\nvarieties of gem-stones.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1600 Cæsalpinus observed that sugar, saltpetre, and alum,\r\nand also the sulphates of copper, zinc and iron, known then as blue,\r\nwhite and green vitriol respectively, separate from their solutions in\r\ncharacteristic forms. Had he not attributed this to the operation of an\r\norganic force, in conformity with the curious opinion of the times\r\nconcerning crystals, he might have had the credit of being the pioneer\r\nof crystallographers. The first two real steps in crystallography,\r\nhowever, with which in our own historic times we are acquainted, were\r\ntaken in the seventeenth century within four years of each other, one\r\nfrom the interior structural and the other from the exterior geometrical\r\npoint of view. For in 1665 Robert Hooke in this country made a study of\r\nalum, which he appears to have obtained in good crystals, although he\r\nwas unacquainted with its true chemical composition. He describes in his\r\n“Micrographia” how he was able to imitate the varying habits of the\r\noctahedral forms of alum crystals by building piles of spherical musket\r\nbullets, and states that all the various figures which he observed in\r\nthe many crystals which he examined could be produced from two or three\r\narrangements of globular particles. It is clear that the homogeneous\r\npartitioning of space in a crystal structure by similar particles\r\nbuilding up the crystal substance was in Hooke’s mind, affording another\r\ntestimony to the remarkably prescient insight of our great countryman.\r\n\r\nFour years later, in 1669, Nicolaus Steno carried out in Florence some\r\nremarkable measurements, considering the absence of proper instruments,\r\nof the angles between the corresponding faces of different specimens of\r\nrock-crystal (quartz, the naturally occurring dioxide of silicon,\r\nconcerning which there will be much to say later in this book), obtained\r\nfrom different localities, and published a dissertation announcing that\r\nhe found these analogous angles all precisely the same.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1688 the subject was taken up systematically by Guglielmini,\r\nand in two memoirs of this date and 1705 he extended Steno’s conclusions\r\nas to the constancy of crystal angles in the case of rock-crystal into a\r\ngeneral law of nature. Moreover, he began to speculate about the\r\ninterior structure of crystals, and, like Hooke, he took alum as his\r\ntext, and suggested that the ultimate particles possessed plane faces,\r\nand were, in short, miniature crystals. He further announced the\r\nconstancy of the cleavage directions, so that to Guglielmini must be\r\nawarded the credit for having, at a time when experimental methods of\r\ncrystallographic investigation were practically _nil_, discovered the\r\nfundamental principles of crystallography.\r\n\r\nThe fact that a perfect cleavage is exhibited by calcite had already\r\nbeen observed by Erasmus Bartolinus in 1670, and in his “Experimenta\r\nCrystalli Islandici” he gives a most interesting account of the great\r\ndiscovery of immense clear crystals of calcite which had just been made\r\nat Eskifjördhr in Iceland, minutely describing both their cleavage and\r\ntheir strong double refraction. Huyghens in 1690 followed this up by\r\ninvestigating some of these crystals of calcite still more closely, and\r\nelaborated his laws of double refraction as the result of his studies.\r\n\r\nThere now followed a century which was scarcely productive of any\r\nfurther advance at all in our real knowledge of crystals. It is true\r\nthat Boyle in 1691 showed that the rapidity with which a solution cools\r\ninfluences the habit of the crystals which are deposited from it. But\r\nneither Boyle, with all his well-known ability, so strikingly displayed\r\nin his work on the connection between the volume of a gas and the\r\npressure to which it is subjected, nor his lesser contemporaries Lemery\r\nand Homberg, who produced and studied the crystals of several series of\r\nsalts of the same base with different acids, appreciated the truth of\r\nthe great fact discovered by Guglielmini, that the same substance always\r\npossesses the same crystalline form the angles of which are constant.\r\nEven with the growth of chemistry in the eighteenth century, the opinion\r\nremained quite general that the crystals of the same substance differ in\r\nthe magnitude of their angles as well as in the size of their faces.\r\n\r\nWe begin to perceive signs of progress again in the year 1767, when\r\nWestfeld made the interesting suggestion that calcite is built up of\r\nrhombohedral particles, the miniature faces of which correspond to the\r\ncleavage directions. This was followed in 1780 by a treatise “De formis\r\ncrystallorum” by Bergmann and Gahn of Upsala, in which Guglielmini’s law\r\nof the constancy of the cleavage directions was reasserted as a general\r\none, and intimately connected with the crystal structure. It was in this\r\nyear 1780 that the contact goniometer was invented by Carangeot,\r\nassistant to Romé de l’Isle in Paris, and it at once placed at the\r\ndisposal of his master a weapon of research far superior to any\r\npossessed by previous observers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 11.—Contact Goniometer as used by Romé de l’Isle.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn his “Crystallographie,” published in Paris in 1783, Romé de l’Isle\r\ndescribed a very large number of naturally occurring mineral crystals,\r\nand after measuring their angles with Carangeot’s goniometer he\r\nconstructed models of no less than 500 different forms. Here we have\r\nwork based upon sound measurement, and consequently of an altogether\r\ndifferent and higher value than that which had gone before. It was the\r\nknowledge that his master desired to faithfully reproduce the small\r\nnatural crystals which he was investigating, on the larger scale of a\r\nmodel, that led Carangeot to invent the contact goniometer, and thus to\r\nmake the first start in the great subject of goniometry. The principle\r\nof the contact goniometer remains to-day practically as Carangeot left\r\nit, and although replaced for refined work by the reflecting goniometer,\r\nit is still useful when large mineral crystals have to be dealt with. An\r\nillustration of a duplicate of the original instrument is shown in Fig.\r\n11, by the kindness of Dr H. A. Miers. This duplicate was presented to\r\nProf. Buckland by the Duke of Buckingham in the year 1824, and is now in\r\nthe Oxford Museum.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that measurement of an accurate description was possible\r\nby means of the contact goniometer, progress in crystallography became\r\nrapid. Romé de l’Isle laid down the sound principle, as the result of\r\nthe angular measurements and the comparison of his accurate models with\r\none another, that the various crystal shapes developed by the same\r\nsubstance, artificial or natural, were all intimately related, and\r\nderivable from a primitive form, characteristic of the substance. He\r\nconsidered that the great variety of form was due to the development of\r\nsecondary faces, other than those of the primitive form. He thus\r\nconnected together the work of previous observers, consolidated the\r\nprinciples laid down by Guglielmini by measurements of real value, and\r\nthrew out the additional suggestion of a fundamental or primitive form.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Werner was studying the principal forms of different\r\ncrystals of the same substance. The idea of a fundamental form appears\r\nto have struck him also, and he showed how such a fundamental form may\r\nbe modified by truncating, bevelling, and replacing its faces by other\r\nderived forms. His work, however, cannot possess the value of that of\r\nRomé de l’Isle, as it was not based on exact measurement, and most of\r\nall because Werner appears to have again admitted the fallacy that the\r\nsame substance could, in the ordinary way, and not in the sense now\r\ntermed polymorphism, exhibit several different fundamental forms.\r\n\r\nBut a master mind was at hand destined definitely to remove these doubts\r\nand to place the new science on a firm basis. An account of how this was\r\nachieved is well worthy of a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                  THE PRESCIENT WORK OF THE ABBÉ HAÜY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe important work of Romé de l’Isle had paved the way for a further and\r\nstill greater advance which we owe to the University of Paris, for its\r\nProfessor of the Humanities, the Abbé Réné Just Haüy, a name ever to be\r\nregarded with veneration by crystallographers, took up the subject\r\nshortly after Romé de l’Isle, and in 1782 laid most important results\r\nbefore the French Academy, which were subsequently, in 1784, published\r\nin a book, under the auspices of the Academy, entitled “Essai d’une\r\nThéorie sur la Structure des Crystaux.” The author happens to possess,\r\nas the gift of a kind friend, a copy of the original issue of this\r\nhighly interesting and now very rare work. It contains a brief preface,\r\ndated the 26th November 1783, signed by the Marquis de Condorcet,\r\nperpetual secretary to the Academy (who, in 1794, fell a victim to the\r\nFrench revolution), to the effect that the Academy had expressed its\r\napproval and authorised the publication “under its privilege.”\r\n\r\nThe volume contains six excellent plates of a large number of most\r\ncareful drawings of crystals, illustrating the derivation from the\r\nsimple forms, such as the cube, octahedron, dodecahedron, rhombohedron,\r\nand hexagonal prism, of the more complicated forms by the symmetrical\r\nreplacement of edges and corners, together with the drawings of many\r\nstructural lattices. In the text, Haüy shows clearly how all the\r\nvarieties of crystal forms are constructed according to a few simple\r\ntypes of symmetry; for instance, that the cube, octahedron, and\r\ndodecahedron all have the same high degree of symmetry, and that the\r\napparently very diverse forms shown by one and the same substance are\r\nall referable to one of these simple fundamental or systematic forms.\r\nMoreover, Haüy clearly states the laws which govern crystal symmetry,\r\nand practically gives us the main lines of symmetry of five of the seven\r\nsystems as we now classify them, the finishing touch having been\r\nsupplied in our own time by Victor von Lang.\r\n\r\nHaüy further showed that difference of chemical composition was\r\naccompanied by real difference of crystalline form, and he entered\r\ndeeply into chemistry, so far as it was then understood, in order to\r\nextend the scope of his observations. It must be remembered that it was\r\nonly nine years before, in 1774, that Priestley had discovered oxygen,\r\nand that Lavoisier had only just (in the same year as Haüy’s paper was\r\nread to the Academy, 1782) published his celebrated “Elements de\r\nChimie”; and further, that Lavoisier’s memoir “Reflexions sur le\r\nPhlogistique” was actually published by the Academy in the same year,\r\n1783, as that in which this book was written by Haüy. Moreover, it was\r\nalso in this same year, 1783, that Cavendish discovered the compound\r\nnature of water.\r\n\r\nConsidering, therefore, all these facts, it is truly surprising that\r\nHaüy should have been able to have laid so accurately the foundations of\r\nthe science of crystallography. That he undoubtedly did so, thus\r\nsecuring to himself for all time the term which is currently applied to\r\nhim of “father of crystallography,” is clearly apparent from a perusal\r\nof his book and of his subsequent memoirs.\r\n\r\nThe above only represents a small portion of Haüy’s achievements. For he\r\ndiscovered, besides, the law of rational indices, the generalisation\r\nwhich is at the root of crystallographic science, limiting, as it does,\r\nthe otherwise infinite number of possible crystal forms to comparatively\r\nfew, which alone are found to be capable of existence as actual\r\ncrystals. The essence of this law, which will be fully explained in\r\nChapter V., is that the relative lengths intercepted along the three\r\nprincipal axes of the crystal, by the various faces other than those of\r\nthe fundamental form, the faces of which are parallel to the axes, are\r\nexpressed by the simplest unit integers, 1, 2, 3, or 4, the latter being\r\nrarely exceeded and then only corresponding to very small and altogether\r\nsecondary faces.\r\n\r\nThis discovery impressed Haüy with the immense influence which the\r\nstructure of the crystal substance exerts on the external form, and how,\r\nin fact, it determines that form. For the observations were only to be\r\nexplained on the supposition that the crystal was built up of structural\r\nunits, which he imagined to be miniature crystals shaped like the\r\nfundamental form, and that the faces were dependent on the step-like\r\narrangement possible to the exterior of such an assemblage. This brought\r\nhim inevitably to the intimate relation which cleavage must bear to such\r\na structure, that it really determined the shape of, and was the\r\nexpression of the nature of, the structural units. Thus, before the\r\nconception of the atomic theory by Dalton, whose first paper (read 23rd\r\nOctober 1803), was published in the year 1803 in the Proceedings of the\r\nManchester Literary and Philosophical Society, two years after the\r\npublication of Haüy’s last work (his “Traité de Minéralogie,” Paris,\r\n1801), Haüy came to the conclusion that crystals were composed of units\r\nwhich he termed “_Molécules Intégrantes_,” each of which comprised the\r\nwhole chemical compound, a sort of gross chemical molecule. Moreover, he\r\nwent still further in his truly original insight, for he actually\r\nsuggested that the _molécules intégrantes_ were in turn composed of\r\n“_Molécules Elémentaires_,” representing the simple matter of the\r\nelementary substances composing the compound, and hinted further that\r\nthese elementary portions had properly orientated positions within the\r\n_molécules intégrantes_.\r\n\r\nHe thus not only nearly forestalled Dalton’s atomic theory, but also our\r\nrecent work on the stereometric orientation of the atoms in the molecule\r\nin a crystal structure. Dalton’s full theory was not published until the\r\nyear 1811, in his epoch-making book entitled “A New System of Chemical\r\nPhilosophy,” although his first table of atomic weights was given as an\r\nappendix to the memoir of 1803. Thus in the days when chemistry was in\r\nthe making at the hands of Priestley, Lavoisier, Cavendish, and Dalton\r\ndo we find that crystallography was so intimately connected with it that\r\na crystallographer well-nigh forestalled a chemist in the first real\r\nepoch-making advance, a lesson that the two subjects should never be\r\nseparated in their study, for if either the chemist or the\r\ncrystallographer knows but little of what the other is doing, his work\r\ncannot possibly have the full value with which it would otherwise be\r\nendowed.\r\n\r\nThe basis of Haüy’s conceptions was undoubtedly cleavage. He describes\r\nmost graphically on page 10 of his “Essai” of 1784 how he was led to\r\nmake the striking observation that a hexagonal prism of calcite,\r\nterminated by a pair of hexagons normal to the prism axis, similar to\r\nthe prisms shown in Fig. 6 (Plate III.) except that the ends were flat,\r\nshowed oblique internal cleavage cracks, by enhancing which with the aid\r\nof a few judicious blows he was able to separate from the middle of the\r\nprism a kernel in the shape of a rhombohedron, the now well-known\r\ncleavage rhombohedron of calcite. He then tried what kinds of kernels he\r\ncould get from dog-tooth spar (illustrated in Fig. 7) and other\r\ndifferent forms of calcite, and he was surprised to find that they all\r\nyielded the same rhombohedral kernel. He subsequently investigated the\r\ncleavage kernels of other minerals, particularly of gypsum, fluorspar,\r\ntopaz, and garnet, and found that each mineral yielded its own\r\nparticular kernel. He next imagined the kernels to become smaller and\r\nsmaller, until the particles thus obtained by cleaving the mineral along\r\nits cleavage directions _ad infinitum_ were the smallest possible. These\r\nminiature kernels having the full composition of the mineral he terms\r\n“_Molécules Constituantes_” in the 1784 “Essai,” but in the 1801\r\n“Traité” he calls them “_Molécules Intégrantes_” as above mentioned. He\r\nsoon found that there were three distinct types of _molécules\r\nintégrantes_, tetrahedra, triangular prisms, and parallelepipeda, and\r\nthese he considered to be the crystallographic structural units.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 12.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHaving thus settled what were the units of the crystal structure, Haüy\r\nadopted Romé de l’Isle’s idea of a primitive form, not necessarily\r\nidentical with the _molécule intégrante_, but in general a\r\nparallelepipedon formed by an association of a few _molécules\r\nintégrantes_, the parallelepipedal group being termed a “_Molécule\r\nSoustractive_.” The primary faces of the crystal he then supposed to be\r\nproduced by the simple regular growth or piling on of _molécules\r\nintégrantes_ or _soustractives_ on the primitive form. The secondary\r\nfaces not parallel to the cleavage planes next attracted his attention,\r\nand these, after prolonged study, he explained by supposing that the\r\ngrowth upon the primitive form eventually ceased to be complete at the\r\nedges of the primary faces, and that such cessation occurred in a\r\nregular step by step manner, by the suppression of either one, two, or\r\nsometimes three _molécules intégrantes_ or _soustractives_ along the\r\nedge of each layer, like a stepped pyramid, the inclination of which\r\ndepends on how many bricks or stone blocks are intermitted in each layer\r\nof brickwork or masonry. Fig. 12 will render this quite clear, the face\r\nAB being formed by single block-steps, and the face CD by two blocks\r\nbeing intermitted to form each step. The plane AB or CD containing the\r\noutcropping edges of the steps would thus be the secondary plane face of\r\nthe crystal, and the _molécules_ _intégrantes_ or _soustractives_ (the\r\nsteps can only be formed by parallelepipedal units) being\r\ninfinitesimally small, the re-entrant angles of the steps would be\r\ninvisible and the really furrowed surface appear as a plane one. Haüy is\r\ncareful to point out, however, that the crystallising force which causes\r\nthis stepped development (or lack of development) is operative from the\r\nfirst, for the minutest crystals show secondary faces, and often better\r\nthan the larger crystals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 13.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn instance of a mineral with tetrahedral _molécules intégrantes_ Haüy\r\ngives in tourmaline, and the primitive form of tourmaline he considered\r\nto be a rhombohedron, conformably to the well-known rhombohedral\r\ncleavage of the mineral, made up of six tetrahedra. Again, hexagonal\r\nstructures formed by three prismatic cleavage planes inclined at 60° are\r\nconsidered by him as being composed of _molécules intégrantes_ of the\r\nform of 60° triangular prisms, or _molécules soustractives_ of the shape\r\nof 120° rhombic prisms, each of the latter being formed by two\r\n_molécules intégrantes_ situated base to base. This will be clear from\r\nFigs. 13 and 14, the former representing the structure as made up of\r\nequilateral prismatic structural units, and the latter portraying the\r\nsame structure but composed of 120°-parallelepipeda by elimination of\r\none cleavage direction; each unit in the latter case possesses double\r\nthe volume of the triangular one, and being of parallelepipedal section\r\nis capable of producing secondary faces when arranged step-wise, whereas\r\nthe triangular structure is not. The points at the intersections in\r\nthese diagrams should for the present be disregarded; they will shortly\r\nbe referred to for another purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 14.\r\n]\r\n\r\nProbably, the most permanent and important of Haüy’s achievements was\r\nthe discovery of the law of rational indices. At first this only took\r\nthe form of the observation of the very limited number of rows of\r\n_molécules intégrantes_ or _soustractives_ suppressed. In introducing it\r\non page 74 of his 1784 “Essai” he says: “_Quoique je n’aie observé\r\njusqu’ici que des décroissemens qui se sont par des soutractions d’une\r\nou de deux rangées de molécules, et quelquefois de trois rangées, mais\r\ntrès rarement, il est possible qu’il se trouve des crystaux dans\r\nlesquels il y ait quatre ou cinq rangées de molécules supprimées à\r\nchaque décroissement, et même un plus grand nombre encore. Mais ces cas\r\nme semblent devoir être plus rares, à proportion que le nombre des\r\nrangées soutraites sera plus considérable. On conçoit donc comment le\r\nnombre des formes secondaires est néçessairement limité._”\r\n\r\nThe essential difference between Haüy’s views and our present ones,\r\nwhich will be explained in Chapter IX., is that Haüy takes cleavage\r\nabsolutely as his guide, and considers the particles, into which the\r\nultimate operation of cleavage divides a crystal, as the solid\r\nstructural units of the crystal, the unit thus having the shape of at\r\nleast the _molécule intégrante_. Now every crystalline substance does\r\nnot develop cleavage, and others only develop it along a single plane,\r\nor along a couple of planes parallel to the same direction, that of\r\ntheir intersection and of the axis of the prism which two such cleavages\r\nwould produce, and which prism would be of unlimited length, being\r\nunclosed.\r\n\r\nAgain, in other cases cleavage, such as the octahedral cleavage of\r\nfluorspar, yields octahedral or tetrahedral _molécules intégrantes_\r\nwhich are not congruent, that is to say, do not fit closely together to\r\nfill space, as is the essence of Haüy’s theory. Hence, speaking\r\ngenerally, partitioning by means of cleavage directions does not\r\nessentially and invariably yield identical plane-faced molecules which\r\nfit together in contact to completely fill space, although in the\r\nparticular instances chosen from familiar substances by Haüy it often\r\nhappens to do so. Haüy’s theory is thus not adequately general, and the\r\nadvance of our knowledge of crystal forms has rendered it more and more\r\napparent that Haüy’s theory was quite insufficient, and his _molécules\r\nintégrantes_ and _soustractives_ mere geometrical abstractions, having\r\nno actual basis in material fact; but that at the same time it gave us a\r\nmost valuable indication of where to look for the true conception.\r\n\r\nThis will be developed further into our present theory of the\r\nhomogeneous partitioning of space, in Chapter IX. But it may be stated\r\nhere, in concluding our review of the pioneer work of Haüy, that in the\r\nmodern theory all consideration of the shape of the ultimate structural\r\nunits is abandoned as unnecessary and misleading, and that each chemical\r\nmolecule is considered to be represented by a point, which may be either\r\nits centre of gravity, a particular atom in the molecule (for we are now\r\nable in certain cases to locate the orientation of the spheres of\r\ninfluence of the elementary atoms in the chemical molecules), or a\r\npurely representative point standing for the molecule. The only\r\ncondition is that the points chosen within the molecules shall be\r\nstrictly analogous, and similarly orientated. The dots at the\r\nintersections of the lines in Figs. 13 and 14 are the representative\r\npoints in question. We then deal with the distances between the points,\r\nthe latter being regarded as molecular centres, rather than with the\r\ndimensions of the cells themselves regarded as solid entities. We thus\r\navoid the as yet unsolved question of how much is matter and how much is\r\ninterspace in the room between the molecular centres. In this form the\r\ntheory is in conformity with all the advances of modern physics, as well\r\nas of chemistry. And with this reservation, and after modifying his\r\ntheory to this extent, one cannot but be struck with the wonderful\r\nperspicacity of Haüy, for he appears to have observed and considered\r\nalmost every problem with which the crystallographer is confronted, and\r\nhis laws of symmetry and of rational indices are perfectly applicable to\r\nthe theory as thus modernised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n               THE SEVEN STYLES OF CRYSTAL ARCHITECTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is truly curious how frequently the perfect number, seven, is endowed\r\nwith exceptional importance with regard to natural phenomena. The seven\r\norders of spectra, the seven notes of the musical octave, and the seven\r\nchemical elements, together with the seven vertical groups to which by\r\ntheir periodic repetition they give rise, of the “period” of\r\nMendeléeff’s classification of the elements, will at once come to mind\r\nas cases in point. This proverbial importance of the number seven is\r\nonce again illustrated in regard to the systems of symmetry or styles of\r\narchitecture displayed by crystals. For there are seven such systems of\r\ncrystal symmetry, each distinguished by its own specific elements of\r\nsymmetry.\r\n\r\nIt is only within recent years that we have come to appreciate what are\r\nthe real elements of symmetry. For although there are but seven systems,\r\nthere are no less than thirty-two classes of crystals, and these were\r\nformerly grouped under six systems, on lines which have since proved to\r\nbe purely arbitrary and not founded on any truly scientific basis. It\r\nwas supposed that those classes in any system which did not exhibit all\r\nthe faces possible to the system owed this lack of development to the\r\nsuppression of one-half or three-quarters of the possible number, and\r\nsuch classes were consequently called “hemihedral” and “tetartohedral”\r\nrespectively. As in the higher systems of symmetry there were usually\r\ntwo or more ways in which a particular proportionate suppression of\r\nfaces could occur, it happened that several classes, and not merely\r\nthree—holohedral (possessing the full number of faces), hemihedral, and\r\ntetartohedral—constituted each of these systems.\r\n\r\nThanks largely to the genius of Victor von Lang, who was formerly with\r\nus in England at the Mineral Department of the British Museum, and to\r\nhis successor there, Nevil Story Maskelyne, we have at last a much more\r\nscientific basis for our classification of crystals, and one which is in\r\ncomplete harmony with the now perfected theory of possible homogeneous\r\nstructures. Victor von Lang showed that the true elements of symmetry\r\nare planes of symmetry and axes of symmetry. A crystal possessing a\r\nplane of symmetry is symmetrical on both sides of that plane, both as\r\nregards the number of the faces and their precise angular disposition\r\nwith respect to one another.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible, and even the usual case, that the relative\r\ndevelopment of the faces, that is their actual sizes, may prevent the\r\nsymmetry from being at first apparent; but when we come to measure the\r\nangles between the faces, by use of the reflecting goniometer, and to\r\nplot their positions out on the surface of a sphere, or on a plane\r\nrepresentation of the latter on paper, the exceedingly useful\r\n“stereographic projection,” we at once perceive the symmetry perfectly\r\nplainly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 15.—Crystal of Potassium Nickel Sulphate.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 16.—Projection of Potassium Nickel Sulphate and its Isomorphous\r\n    Analogues.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThus in Fig. 15 is represented a crystal of the salt potassium nickel\r\nsulphate, K_{2}Ni(SO_{4})_{2}.6H_{2}O, belonging to the monoclinic\r\nsystem of symmetry, and which, therefore, possesses only one plane of\r\nsymmetry. In Fig. 16 its stereographic projection is shown, in which\r\neach face in one of the symmetrical halves is represented by a dot, the\r\nplane of symmetry, parallel to the face _b_, being the plane of the\r\npaper, so that each dot not on the circumference really represents two\r\nsymmetrical faces, one above and one below the paper, while the\r\ncircumferential dots represent faces perpendicular to the symmetry plane\r\nand paper. The mode of arriving at such a useful projection, or plan of\r\nthe faces, will be discussed more fully later in Chapter VI. But for the\r\npresent purpose it will be sufficient to note that the right and left\r\nhalves of the crystal shown in Fig. 15 are obviously symmetrical to each\r\nother, and that the plan of either half, projected on the dividing plane\r\nof symmetry itself, may be taken as given in Fig. 16; that is, we may\r\nimagine the crystal shown in Fig. 15 to be equally divided by a section\r\nplane which is vertical and perpendicular to the paper when the latter\r\nis held up behind the crystal and in front of the eye, this section\r\nplane being the plane of symmetry and parallel to the face _b_ = (010).\r\nIt may thus be imagined as the plane of projection of Fig. 16.\r\n\r\nAn axis of symmetry is a direction in the crystal such that when the\r\nlatter is rotated for an angle of 60°, 90°, 120°, or 180° around it, the\r\ncrystal is brought to look exactly as it did before such rotation. When\r\na rotation for 180° is necessary in order to reproduce the original\r\nappearance, the axis is called a “digonal” axis of symmetry, for two\r\nsuch rotations then complete the circle and bring the crystal back to\r\nidentity, not merely to similarity. When the rotation into a position of\r\nsimilarity is for 120°, three such rotations are required to restore\r\nidentity, and the axis is then termed a “trigonal” one. Similarly, four\r\nrotations to positions of similarity 90° apart are essential to complete\r\nthe restoration to identity, and the axis is then a “tetragonal” one,\r\neach rotation of a right angle causing the crystal to appear as at\r\nfirst, assuming, as in all cases, the ideal equality of development of\r\nfaces. Lastly, if 60° of rotation bring about similarity, six such\r\nrotations are required in order to effect identity of position, and the\r\naxis is known as a “hexagonal” one.\r\n\r\nNow, there is one system of symmetry which is characterised by the\r\npresence of a single hexagonal axis of symmetry, and this is the\r\n_hexagonal system_. A crystal of this system, one of the naturally\r\noccurring mineral apatite, which has been actually measured by the\r\nauthor, is shown in Fig. 17. There is another system, the chief property\r\nof which is to possess a tetragonal axis of symmetry, and which is\r\ntherefore termed the _tetragonal system_. A tetragonal crystal of\r\nanatase, titanium dioxide, TiO_{2}, which has likewise been measured on\r\nthe goniometer by the author, is shown in Fig. 18. And there is yet\r\nanother system, the trigonal, the chief attribute of which is the\r\npossession of a single trigonal axis of symmetry, and which is\r\nconsequently named the trigonal system. In Fig. 19 is shown a crystal of\r\ncalcite, within which the directions of the three rhombohedral\r\ncrystallographic axes of the trigonal system, and that of the vertical\r\ntrigonal axis of symmetry, are indicated in broken-and-dotted lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 17.—Measured Crystal of Apatite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 18.—Measured Crystal of Anatase.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut there is one system of symmetry, the highest possible, and which has\r\nalready been referred to as the _cubic system_, which combines in itself\r\nall but one (the hexagonal axis) of the elements of symmetry. Indeed,\r\nnot only does it possess a tetragonal, a trigonal, and a digonal axis of\r\nsymmetry, but also ten other symmetry axes; for these three\r\nautomatically involve altogether the presence of no less than three\r\ntetragonal, four trigonal, and six digonal axes of symmetry, together\r\nwith nine planes of symmetry, twenty-two elements of symmetry being thus\r\npresent in all.\r\n\r\nThe perfections of the cube, the simple lines of which are illustrated\r\nin Fig. 20, as the expression of the highest kind of symmetry, with\r\nangles all right angles and sides and edges all equal, were so fully\r\nappreciated by the geometrical minds of the ancient Greek philosophers,\r\nimbued with the innate love of symmetry characteristic of their nation,\r\nthat to them the cube became the emblem of perfection. We are reminded\r\nof this interesting fact in the Book of Revelation, which, in describing\r\nin its inimitable language the wonders of the Holy City, speaks of it as\r\n“lying foursquare,” and attributes to it the properties of the cube,\r\nthat “The length and the breadth and the height of it are equal.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 19.—Crystal of Calcite.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 20.—The Cube.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 21.—The Hexakis Octahedron.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe full symmetry of the cubic system is not realised, however, by a\r\nstudy of the cube alone; we only appreciate it when we come to examine\r\nthe general form of the cubic system, that which is produced by starting\r\nwith a face oblique to all three axes, and with different amounts of\r\nobliquity to each, and seeing how many repetitions of the face the\r\nsymmetry demands. The presence of such a face involves as a matter of\r\nfact, when all the elements of symmetry are satisfied, the presence also\r\nof no less than forty-seven others, symmetrically situated, the\r\nforty-eight-sided figure produced being the hexakis octahedron shown in\r\nFig. 21, and which is occasionally actually found developed in nature as\r\nthe diamond. All diamonds do not by any means exhibit this form so\r\nwonderfully rich in faces, but diamonds are from time to time found\r\nwhich do show all the forty-eight faces well developed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 22.—Measured Crystal of Topaz.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBesides these four more highly symmetrical systems or styles of crystal\r\narchitecture, a fifth, the _monoclinic system_, characterised by a\r\nsingle plane of symmetry and one axis of digonal symmetry perpendicular\r\nthereto, has already been alluded to, and a typical crystal illustrated\r\nin Fig. 15. A sixth, the _rhombic system_, perhaps in some ways the most\r\ninteresting of all, and certainly so optically, possesses three\r\nrectangular axes of symmetry, identical in direction with the\r\ncrystallographic axes, and three mutually rectangular planes of\r\nsymmetry, coincident with the axial planes and intersecting each other\r\nin the axes. The lengths of the three crystal axes are unequal, however,\r\nand herein lies the essential difference from the cube. A very typical\r\nrhombic substance is topaz, a crystal of which, about three millimetres\r\nin diameter, is shown very much enlarged in Fig. 22. Every face on this\r\ncrystal has been actually investigated on the goniometer, and the\r\ninterfacial angles measured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 23.—Measured Crystal of Copper Sulphate.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLastly, there is the seventh, the _triclinic system_, in which there are\r\nneither planes nor axes of symmetry, but, even in its holohedral class,\r\nonly symmetry about the centre, each face having a parallel fellow.\r\nSulphate of copper, blue vitriol, CuSO_{4}.5H_{2}O, shows this type of\r\nsymmetry, or rather lack of it, very characteristically, and a crystal\r\nof this beautiful deep blue salt, measured by the author, is represented\r\nin Fig. 23.\r\n\r\nHence, we have arrived logically at seven systems of symmetry or styles\r\nof crystal architecture, distinguished by the nature of their essential\r\naxes of symmetry, and the planes of symmetry which may accompany them.\r\nNow the full degree of symmetry of each system may be reduced to a\r\ncertain minimum without lowering the system, and in all the systems but\r\nthe triclinic there are several definite stages of reduction before the\r\nminimum is reached, each stage corresponding to one of the thirty-two\r\nclasses of crystals. Thus in the cubic system there are four classes\r\nbesides the holohedral, in the tetragonal six, in the hexagonal four, in\r\nthe trigonal six, in the rhombic and monoclinic two each, and in the\r\ntriclinic one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE IV._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 24.—Octahedra of Potassium Cadmium Cyanide.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 25.—Octahedra of Cæsium Alum.\r\n\r\n  CUBIC CRYSTALS GROWING FROM SOLUTION.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe have thus attained at length to a truly scientific classification of\r\ncrystal forms, by using axes and planes of symmetry as _criteria_. There\r\nis no occasion whatever to imagine suppression of faces in the classes\r\nof lower than the holohedral or highest symmetry of any system. In these\r\nclasses it is simply the fact that less than the full number of elements\r\nof symmetry possible to the system are present and characterise the\r\nclass, which still conforms, however, to the minimum symmetry absolutely\r\nessential to the system.\r\n\r\nThe drawings of crystals of the seven systems in the foregoing\r\nillustrations will have given a correct idea of the nature of the\r\nsymmetry in each case. But now it may be much more interesting to\r\npresent a series of reproductions of photographs of some actual crystals\r\nof the different systems. Such a series is given in Figs. 24 to 33,\r\nPlates IV. to VIII. They were taken with the aid of the microscope, the\r\nsubstances being crystallised from a slightly supersaturated solution in\r\neach case, on a microscope slip. A ring of gold size was first laid on\r\nthe slip, and allowed to dry for several days. The drop of solution, in\r\nthe metastable supersaturated condition (corresponding to the region of\r\nsolubility which lies between the solubility and supersolubility curves,\r\nFig. 98, page 240), was placed in the middle of the ring, and\r\ncrystallisation just allowed to start, either owing to evaporation and\r\nconsequent production of the labile condition for spontaneous\r\ncrystallisation, or by access of a germ crystal from the air. It was\r\nthen covered with a cover-glass, which had the desired effect of\r\nenclosing the solution in a parallelsided cell, a film of the thickness\r\nof thick paper, suitable for undistorted microscopic observation and\r\nphotomicrography, and also the effect of arresting evaporation and\r\ntherefore the rapidity of the growth of the crystals, so that a\r\nphotomicrograph taken with the minimum necessary exposure was quite\r\nsharp.\r\n\r\nThe crystals shown in the accompanying photographic reproductions, Figs.\r\n24 to 33 (Plates IV. to VIII.), as well as Fig. 4 (Plate II.), already\r\ndescribed, were thus photographed in the very act of slow growth,\r\nemploying a one-inch objective very much stopped down. Such photographs\r\nare infinitely sharper and more beautifully and delicately shaded than\r\nthose taken of dry crystals.\r\n\r\nFig. 24, Plate IV., represents cubic octahedra of the double cyanide of\r\npotassium and cadmium, 2KCN.Cd(CN)_{2}, a salt which crystallises out in\r\nrelatively large and wonderfully transparent and well-formed single\r\noctahedra on a micro-slip, and is particularly suitable for\r\ndemonstrating the character of this highest system, the cubic, of\r\ncrystal symmetry. Special development of the pair of faces of the\r\noctahedron parallel to the glass surfaces has occurred, owing to greater\r\nfreedom of growth at the boundaries of these faces, as is usual in such\r\ncircumstances of deposition, but the other pairs of faces are quite\r\nlarge enough to show their nature clearly.\r\n\r\nFig. 25, on the same Plate IV., shows a slide of cæsium alum,\r\nCs_{2}SO_{4}.Al_{2}(SO_{4})_{3}.24H_{2}O, in which the octahedra are\r\nsmaller, and some of them, notably one in the centre of the field, are\r\nperfectly proportioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE V._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 26.—Octahedra of Ammonium Iron Alum crystallising on a Hair.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 27.—Tetragonal Crystals of Potassium Ferrocyanide.\r\n\r\n  CRYSTALS GROWING FROM SOLUTION.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE VI._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 28.--Rhombic Crystals of Potassium Hydrogen Tartrate.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 29.--Rhombic Crystals of Ammonium Magnesium Phosphate, showing\r\n    Special Growth along Line of Scratch.\r\n\r\n  RHOMBIC CRYSTALS GROWING BY SLOW PRECIPITATION.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 26, Plate V., represents octahedra of ammonium iron alum (formula\r\nlike that of cæsium alum, but with NH_{4} replacing Cs and Fe replacing\r\nAl) crystallising on a hair. It illustrates the interesting manner in\r\nwhich crystallisation will sometimes occur, under conditions of\r\nquietude, when some object or other on which the crystals can readily\r\ndeposit themselves is present or introduced, such as a silk or cotton\r\nthread, or a hair as in this case.\r\n\r\nFig. 27, on the same Plate V., represents tetragonal crystals of\r\npotassium ferrocyanide, K_{4}Fe(CN)_{6}, composed of tabular crystals\r\nparallel to the basal pinakoid, bounded by faces of one order, first or\r\nsecond, of tetragonal prism, the corners being modified at 45° by\r\nsmaller faces of the other order of tetragonal prism.\r\n\r\nFig. 28, Plate VI., is a photograph of large rhombic crystals of\r\nhydrogen potassium tartrate, HKC_{4}H_{4}O_{6}, obtained by addition of\r\ntartaric acid to a dilute solution of potassium chloride. They are\r\nrectangular rhombic prisms capped by pyramidal forms, and also modified\r\nby other prismatic and domal forms.\r\n\r\nFig. 29, also on Plate VI., represents another rhombic substance,\r\nammonium magnesium phosphate, NH_{4}MgPO_{4}.6H_{2}O, obtained by very\r\nslow precipitation of a dilute solution of magnesium sulphate containing\r\nammonium chloride and ammonia with hydrogen disodium phosphate. It\r\nillustrates in an interesting manner how, when a saturated solution is\r\nkept quiet, and then the surface of the vessel containing it is\r\nscratched by a needle point, a line of small crystals at once starts\r\nforming along the line of scratch, even although the latter has made no\r\nactual impression on the glass itself. Such a line of crystals will be\r\nobserved running across the middle of the slide.\r\n\r\nFig. 30, Plate VII., shows a monoclinic substance, ammonium magnesium\r\nsulphate (NH_{4})_{2}Mg(SO_{4})_{2}.6H_{2}O, which crystallises out\r\nsplendidly on a micro-slip. The field includes several very well-formed\r\ntypical crystals of the salt, which is one of the same exceedingly\r\nimportant isomorphous series to which potassium nickel sulphate, Fig.\r\n15, belongs; it is obtained by mixing solutions containing molecularly\r\nequivalent quantities of ammonium and magnesium sulphates. The primary\r\nmonoclinic prism is the chief form, terminated by clinodome faces and\r\nsmaller strip-faces of the basal plane, the latter, however, being\r\noccasionally the chief end form. Small pyramid faces are also seen here\r\nand there modifying the solid angles.\r\n\r\nAnother beautifully crystallising monoclinic substance is shown in the\r\nnext slide, Fig. 31, on the same Plate VII., namely, potassium sodium\r\ncarbonate, KNaCO_{3}.6H_{2}O, obtained from a solution of molecular\r\nproportions of potassium and sodium carbonates. Numerous forms of the\r\nmonoclinic system are developed, on relatively large and perfectly\r\ntransparent and delicately shaded individuals.\r\n\r\nA triclinic substance is represented in Fig. 32, Plate VIII., potassium\r\nferricyanide, K_{6}F_{2}(CN)_{12}. The triply oblique nature of the\r\nsymmetry is clearly exhibited by this salt, the absence of any right\r\nangles being very marked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE VII._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 30.—Monoclinic Crystals of Ammonium Magnesium Sulphate.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 31.—Monoclinic Crystals of Sodium Potassium Carbonate.\r\n\r\n  MONOCLINIC CRYSTALS GROWING FROM SOLUTION.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE VIII._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 32.—Triclinic Crystals of Potassium Ferricyanide.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 33.—Tetrahedral Crystals of Sodium Sulphantimoniate, Cubic Class\r\n    28.\r\n\r\n  CRYSTALS GROWING FROM SOLUTION.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 33, also on Plate VIII., illustrates more particularly a class of\r\none of the systems, the cubic, which is of lower than holohedral (full)\r\nsystematic symmetry. This is the case also with hydrogen potassium\r\ntartrate and ammonium magnesium phosphate, but the forms shown of those\r\nsalts on the slides represented in Figs. 28 and 29 are chiefly those\r\nwhich are also common to the holohedral classes of their respective\r\nsystems, and the lower class symmetry is not emphasised. But here in\r\nFig. 33, representing Schlippe’s salt, sodium sulphantimoniate,\r\nNa_{3}SbS_{4}.9H_{2}O, we have very clear development of the\r\ntetrahedron, belonging to the lowest of the five classes (class 28) of\r\nthe cubic system. The crystals are almost all combinations of two\r\ncomplementary tetrahedra, one of which is developed so very much more\r\nthan the other that the faces of the latter only appear as minute\r\nreplacements at the corners of the predominating tetrahedron.\r\n\r\nThis is the last for the present of these fascinating growths of\r\ncrystals under the microscope, but three more will be given\r\nsubsequently, in Figs. 99 and 100, on Plate XXI., and Fig. 101, Plate\r\nXI., to illustrate crystallisation from metastable and labile solutions.\r\n\r\nFig. 34, Plate IX., represents another kind of phenomenon, equally\r\ninstructive. It shows a field in a crystal of quartz, as seen under the\r\nsame power of the microscope, a one-inch objective with small stop and\r\nan ordinary low power eyepiece. Just above and to the left of the centre\r\nof the field is a cavity, the shape of which is remarkable, for it is\r\nthat of a quartz crystal, a hexagonal prism terminated by rhombohedral\r\nfaces. The cavity is filled with a saturated solution of salt, except\r\nfor a bubble of water vapour, and a beautiful little cube of sodium\r\nchloride which has crystallised out from the solution. This slide,\r\ntherefore, gives us an example of a natural cubic crystal, and also an\r\nindication of the shape of quartz crystals, the cavity itself being a\r\nkind of negative quartz crystal. The crystal in which it occurs must\r\nhave been formed very deep down in a reservoir of molten material\r\nbeneath a volcano, under the great pressure of superincumbent rock\r\nmasses. It was probably one of the quartz crystals of a granite rock\r\nwhich had crystallised under these conditions. Almost every crystal of\r\nquartz found in such granite rocks displays thousands of small cavities\r\nfilled with liquid and a bubble, although it is very rare to find one\r\nwith so good a cube of salt and having the configuration of a quartz\r\ncrystal for the shape of the cavity. Many such cavities, however,\r\ncontain as the liquid compressed carbonic acid, the very fact of the\r\ncarbonic acid being in the liquefied state affording ample evidence of\r\nthe pressure under which the crystal was formed. The proof that the\r\nliquid is carbonic acid in these cases is afforded by the fact that when\r\nthe crystal is warmed to 32°C., the critical temperature of carbon\r\ndioxide, under which it can no longer remain liquid, but must become a\r\ngas, the bubble disappears and the cavity becomes filled with gas.\r\nCarbonic acid cavities are readily recognised, inasmuch as the bubble is\r\nextremely mobile, and is normally in a state of movement on the very\r\nslightest provocation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE IX._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 34.—Liquid Cavities in quartz Crystal (Trigonal) containing\r\n    Saturated Solution and Cubic Crystals of Sodium Chloride.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 36.—Two characteristic Forms of Snow Crystals (Trigonal).\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 35.—Negative Ice Crystals, or “Water Flowers,” in Ice.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe liquid cavity in the remarkable quartz crystal illustrated in Fig.\r\n34, and the bubble of vapour formed on cooling, and consequent\r\ncontraction of the liquid more than the solid quartz (the thermal\r\ndilatation of liquids being usually greater than that of solids) when it\r\nwas no longer able to fill the cavity, remind one of the beautiful water\r\nflowers formed for the contrary reason in ice on passing a beam of light\r\nthrough a slab, owing to the warming effect of the accompanying heat\r\nrays. Water crystallises like quartz, in the trigonal system, its normal\r\nforms being the hexagonal prism and the rhombohedron. A slab of lake ice\r\nis generally a huge crystal plate perpendicular to the trigonal axis, or\r\nin the case of disturbed growth an interlacing mass of such crystals,\r\nall perpendicular to the optic axis, the axis of the hexagonal prism and\r\nof trigonal symmetry. When the heat rays from the lantern pass through\r\nsuch a slab of ice, the surface of which is focussed on the screen by a\r\nprojecting lens, they cause the ice to begin to melt in numerous spots\r\nin the interior of the slab simultaneously; and the structure of the\r\ncrystal is revealed by the operation occurring with production of\r\ncavities taking the shape of hexagonal stars, which when focussed appear\r\non the screen as shown in Fig. 35. They are filled with water except for\r\na bubble (vacuole), which contains only water vapour. For the liquid\r\nwater occupies less room than did the ice from which it was produced,\r\nowing to the well-known fact that water expands on freezing. This\r\nabnormal expansion with cooling begins at the temperature of the maximum\r\ndensity of water, 4° C., and proceeds steadily until the freezing point\r\n0° is reached, when, at the moment of crystallisation, the mass suddenly\r\nincreases in volume by as much as 10 per cent. This expansive leap when\r\nthe molecules of water marshal themselves into the organised order of\r\nthe homogeneous structure, that of the space-lattice of the trigonal\r\n(rhombohedral) system, is one of the most remarkable phenomena in\r\nnature, and its exceptional character, so contrary to the usual\r\ncontraction on solidification of a liquid, is of vital moment to aquatic\r\nlife. For the layer of ice formed, being lighter than water, floats on\r\nthe surface of the latter, and thus forms a protective layer and\r\nprevents to a large extent further freezing, except as a slow thickening\r\nof the layer, the total freezing of the water of a lake or river being\r\nrendered practically impossible, an obvious provision for the security\r\nof life of the piscatorial and other inhabitants of the waters.\r\n\r\nHence, as the molecules of the substance H_{2}O are one by one detached\r\nfrom their solid assemblage as ice, and become more loosely associated\r\nas the less voluminous liquid water, they cannot occupy the whole of the\r\ncavity formed in the solid ice, and a small vacuous space, occupied only\r\nby water vapour at its ordinary low tension corresponding to the low\r\ntemperature, is formed and appears as the bubble. Moreover, the cavity\r\nitself takes the shape of a hexagonal star-shaped flower, the bubble\r\nshowing at its centre, the cavity being thus a kind of negative ice\r\ncrystal, like the negative quartz crystal shown in Fig. 34. Apparently\r\nin the production of these cavities, just as in the production of the\r\nwell-known etched figures on crystal faces by the application of a\r\nminute quantity of a solvent for the crystal substance, the crystal\r\nedifice is taken down, molecule by molecule, in a regular manner,\r\nresulting in the formation of a cavity showing the symmetry of the\r\nspace-lattice which is present in the crystal structure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE X._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 37.—Piz Palü and Snow-field of the Pers Glacier, from the\r\n    Diavolezza Pass, Upper Engadine.\r\n\r\n  (From a Photograph by the author.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe water flowers of Fig. 35 remind one very much of snow crystals, two\r\nof which, re-engraved from the wonderfully careful drawings of the late\r\nMr Glaisher, are represented in Fig. 36, Plate IX. They all exhibit the\r\nsymmetry of the hexagonal prism, which is equally a form of the trigonal\r\nsystem as it is of the hexagonal system. The snow crystals, being formed\r\nfrom water vapour condensed in the cold upper layers of the atmosphere,\r\nappear more or less as skeleton crystals, owing to the rarity of the\r\nsemi-gaseous material condensed, compared with the extent of the space\r\nin which the crystallisation occurs. Indeed the exquisite tracery of\r\nthese snow crystals appears to afford a visual proof of the existence of\r\nthe trigonal-hexagonal space-lattice as the framework of the crystal\r\nstructure of ice. When one considers the countless numbers of such\r\nbeautiful gems of nature’s handiwork massed together on an extensive\r\nsnow-field of the higher Alps—such as that of the Piz Palü in the Upper\r\nEngadine, shown in Fig. 37, Plate X., as seen from the Diavolezza\r\nPass—produced in the pure air of the higher regions of the atmosphere,\r\nand frequently seen by the early morning climber lying uninjured in all\r\ntheir beauty on the surface of the snow-field, one is lost in amazement\r\nat the prodigality displayed in the broadcast distribution of such\r\npeerless gems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n   HOW CRYSTALS ARE DESCRIBED. THE SIMPLE LAW LIMITING THE NUMBER OF\r\n                            POSSIBLE FORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most wonderful of all the laws relating to crystals is the one\r\nalready briefly referred to which limits and regulates the possible\r\npositions of faces, within the lines of symmetry which have been\r\nindicated in the last chapter. Having laid down the rules of symmetry,\r\nit might be thought that any planes which obey these laws, as regards\r\ntheir mode of repetition about the planes and axes of symmetry, would be\r\npossible. But as a matter of fact this is not so, only a very few planes\r\ninclined at certain definite angles, repeated in accordance with the\r\nsymmetry, being ever found actually developed. The reason for this is of\r\nfar-reaching importance, for it reveals to us the certainty that a\r\ncrystal is a homogeneous structure composed of definite structural units\r\nof tangible size, probably the chemical molecules, built up on the plan\r\nof one of the fourteen space-lattices made known to us by Bravais, and\r\nto be referred to more fully in Chapter VIII. In order to render this\r\nfundamental law comprehensible, it will be essential to explain in a few\r\nsimple words how the crystallographer identifies and labels the numerous\r\nfaces on a crystal, in short, how he describes a crystal, in a manner\r\nwhich shall be understood immediately by everybody who has studied the\r\nvery simple rules of the convention.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that the mathematical geometrician\r\ndefines the position of any point in space with reference to three\r\nplanes, which in the simplest case are all mutually at right angles to\r\neach other like the faces of a cube, and which intersect in three\r\nrectangular axes _a_, _b_, _c_, the third _c_ being the vertical axis,\r\n_b_ the lateral one, and _a_ the front-and-back axis. The distances of\r\nthe point from the three reference planes, as measured by the lengths of\r\nthe three lines drawn from the point to the planes parallel to the three\r\naxes of intersection, at once gives him what he calls the “co-ordinates”\r\nof the point, which absolutely define its position. In the same way we\r\ncan imagine three axes drawn within the crystal, by which not only the\r\nposition of any point on any face of the crystal may be located, but\r\nwhich may be used more simply still to fix the position of the face\r\nitself. The directions chosen as those of the three axes are the edges\r\nof intersection of three of the best developed faces.\r\n\r\nIf there are three such faces inclined at right angles they would be\r\nchosen in preference to all others, as they would certainly prove to be\r\nfaces of prime significance as regards the symmetry of the crystal. If\r\nthere are no such rectangularly inclined faces developed on the crystal,\r\nthen the three best developed faces nearest to 90° to each other are\r\nchosen, the two factors of nearness to rectangularity and excellence of\r\ndevelopment being simultaneously borne in mind in making the choice of\r\naxial planes, and discretion used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 38.—The Cube and its Three Equal Rectangular Axes.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 39.—Tetragonal Prism and its three Rectangular Axes.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIf the crystal belong to the cubic, tetragonal, or rhombic systems, for\r\ninstance, three faces meeting each other rectangularly are possible\r\nplanes on the crystal, and will very frequently be found actually\r\ndeveloped; such would obviously be chosen as the axial planes. The edges\r\nof the cube, or of the tetragonal or rectangular rhombic prism, will be\r\nthe directions of the crystallographic axes in this case, and we can\r\nimagine them moved parallel to themselves until the common centre of\r\nintersection, the “origin” of the analytical geometrician, will occupy\r\nthe centre of the crystal, and the faces of the latter be built up\r\nsymmetrically about it. When the crystal is cubic, the three axes will\r\nbe of equal length as shown in Fig. 38; if tetragonal, the two\r\nhorizontal axes will be equal, but will differ in length from the\r\nvertical axis, as represented in Fig. 39. If the crystal be rhombic, all\r\nthree axes will be of different lengths, as indicated in Fig. 40, which\r\nrepresents the axes and axial planes of an actual rhombic substance,\r\ntopaz, for which the lateral axis _b_ and vertical axis _c_ are nearly\r\nbut not quite equal, while the front-and-back axis _a_ is very\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nWhen the crystal is of monoclinic symmetry, as in Fig. 41, three axes\r\nwill similarly be found as the intersection of three principal parallel\r\npairs of faces, but two of them will be inclined at an angle other than\r\n90° to each other, while the third, the lateral one in Fig. 41, will be\r\nat right angles to those first two and to the plane containing them;\r\nmoreover, all three are unequal in length. In the case of a triclinic\r\ncrystal, shown in Fig. 42, however, there can be no right angles, and\r\nthe intersections of three important faces meeting each other at angles\r\nas near 90° as possible are chosen as the axes, regard being had to both\r\nfactors of approximation to rectangularity and importance of\r\ndevelopment. These triclinic axes are the most general type of crystal\r\naxes, for not only are the angles not right angles, but the lengths of\r\nthe axes are also unequal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 40.—Axial Planes of a Rhombic Crystal.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 41.—Axial Planes of a Monoclinic Crystal.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 42.—Axial Planes of a Triclinic Crystal.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 43.—Hexagonal Prism of the First Order and its Four Axes.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 44.—Hexagonal Prism of the Second Order.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 45.—The Rhombohedron and its Three Equal Axes.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cases of the hexagonal and trigonal systems are somewhat special.\r\nThe hexagonal has four such axes, as represented in Fig. 43, the lines\r\nof intersection of the faces of the hexagonal prism closed by a pair of\r\nperpendicular terminal planes, namely, one vertical axis parallel to the\r\nvertical edges, and three horizontal axes inclined at 120° to each\r\nother, and parallel to the pair of basal plane faces, equal to each\r\nother in length, but different from the length of the vertical axis. The\r\nhexagonal axial-plane prism shown in Fig. 43 is known as one of the\r\nfirst order. The hexagonal prism corresponding to the tetragonal one of\r\nFig. 39, in which the axes emerge in the centres of the faces, is said\r\nto be of the second order, and is shown in Fig. 44. The trigonal system\r\nof crystals is best described with reference to three equal but not\r\nrectangular axes, parallel to the faces of the rhombohedron, one of the\r\nprincipal forms of the system, so well seen in Iceland spar, and\r\nillustrated in Fig. 45. The rhombohedron may be regarded as a cube\r\nresting on one of its corners (solid angles), with the diagonal line\r\njoining this to the opposite corner vertical, and the cube then deformed\r\nby flattening or elongating it along the direction of this diagonal. The\r\nedges meeting at the ends of this vertical diagonal are then the\r\ndirections of the three trigonal crystallographic axes.\r\n\r\nIn this last illustration the vertical direction of the altered diagonal\r\nis that of the trigonal axis of symmetry, for the rhombohedron is\r\nbrought into apparent coincidence with itself again if rotated for 120°\r\nround this direction. But although a symmetry axis, this is not a\r\ncrystallographic axis of reference. It is not shown in Fig. 45,\r\ntherefore, but is given in Fig. 19. On the other hand, the singular\r\nvertical axis of reference of the tetragonal and hexagonal systems is\r\nidentical with the tetragonal or hexagonal axis of symmetry of these\r\nsystems, and the three crystallographic axes of reference of the cube\r\nare identical with the three tetragonal axes of symmetry of the cubic\r\nsystem. In the rhombic system also, the three rectangular axes of\r\nreference are identical with the three digonal axes of symmetry, and in\r\nthe monoclinic system the one axis of reference which is normal to the\r\nplane of the two inclined axes is the unique digonal axis of symmetry of\r\nthat system.\r\n\r\nHaving thus evolved a scientific scheme of reference axes for the faces\r\nof a crystal, it is necessary in all the systems other than the cubic\r\nand trigonal, in which the axes are of equal lengths, to devise a mode\r\nof arriving at the relative lengths of the axes; for on this depends the\r\nmode of determining the positions of the various faces, other than the\r\nthree parallel pairs (or four in the case of the hexagonal system)\r\nchosen as the axial planes. This is very simply done by choosing a\r\nfourth important face inclined to all three axes, when one of this\r\ncharacter is developed, as very frequently happens, as the determinative\r\nface or plane fixing the unit lengths of the axes. When no such face is\r\npresent on the crystal, two others can usually be found, each of which\r\nis inclined to two different axes, so that between them all three axial\r\nlengths are determined. The faces of the octahedron, of the primary\r\ntetragonal pyramid and the primary rhombic pyramid, and of the\r\ncorresponding forms of the other systems, are such determinative planes,\r\nfixing the lengths of the axes. This fact will be clear from the typical\r\nillustration of the most general of these primary or “parametral” forms,\r\nthe triclinic equivalent of the octahedron, given in Fig. 46, the faces\r\nbeing obviously obtained by joining the points marking unit lengths of\r\nthe three axes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 46.—Triclinic Equivalent of the Octahedron.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHaving thus settled the directions of the crystallographic axes and\r\ntheir lengths, it is the next step which reveals the remarkable law to\r\nwhich reference was made at the opening of this chapter. For we find\r\nthat all other faces on the crystal, however complicated and rich in\r\nfaces it may be, cut off lengths from the axes which are represented by\r\nlow whole numbers, that is, either 2, 3, 4, or possibly 5, and very\r\nrarely more than 6 unit lengths. By far the greater number of faces do\r\nnot cut off more than three unit lengths from any axis. Prof. Miller of\r\nCambridge, in the year 1839, gave us a most valuable mode of labelling\r\nand distinguishing the various faces by a symbol involving these three\r\nvalues, employed, however, not directly but in an indirect yet very\r\nsimple manner. If _m_, _n_, _r_ be the three numbers expressing the\r\nintercepts cut off by a face on the three axes, _a_, _b_, _c_\r\nrespectively, and if the Millerian index numbers be represented by _h_,\r\n_k_, _l_, then—\r\n\r\n                _m_ = _a_/_h_, _n_ = _b_/_k_, _r_ = _c_/_l_,\r\n            or, _h_ = _a_/_m_, _k_ = _b_/_n_, _l_ = _c_/_r_.\r\n\r\nEach figure or “index” of the Millerian symbol is thus inversely\r\nproportional to the length of the intercept on the axis concerned. The\r\nintercepts themselves are used as symbols in another mode of labelling\r\ncrystal faces, suggested by Weiss, but this method proves too cumbersome\r\nin practice.\r\n\r\nThe Millerian symbol of a face is always placed within ordinary curved\r\nbrackets (  ), but if the symbol is to stand for the whole set of faces\r\ncomposing the form, the brackets are of the type {  }. Thus the\r\nMillerian symbol of the fourth face (that in the top-right front\r\noctant), determinative of the unit axial lengths, is (111), as shown in\r\nFig. 46, the face in question being marked with this symbol; while the\r\nsymbol {111} indicates the set of faces of the whole or such part of the\r\ndouble pyramid as composes the unit form. In the triclinic system this\r\nform only consists of the face (111) and the parallel one (̄1̄1̄1), but\r\nin the case of the regular octahedron of the cubic system it embraces\r\nall the eight faces. The triclinic octahedron, Fig. 46, is thus made up\r\nof four forms of two faces each. A negative sign over an index indicates\r\ninterception on the axis _a_ behind the centre, on the axis _b_ to the\r\nleft of the centre, or on the vertical axis _c_ below the centre.\r\n\r\nTo take an actual example, suppose a face other than the primary one to\r\nmake the intercepts on the axes 4, 2, 1; in this case _h_ = _a_/4, _k_ =\r\n_b_/2, and _l_ = _c_/1, that is, when referred to the fundamental\r\nprimary form for which _a_, _b_, _c_ are each unity, _h_ = ¼, _k_ = ½,\r\n_l_ = 1, or, bringing them to whole numbers by multiplying by 4, _h_ =\r\n1, _k_ = 2, _c_ = 4, and the symbol in Millerian notation is (124).\r\nAgain, suppose we wish to find the intercepts on the three cubic axes\r\nmade by the face (321) of the hexakis octahedron shown in Fig. 21. To\r\nget each intercept we multiply together the two other Millerian indices,\r\nand if necessary afterwards reduce the three figures obtained to their\r\nsimplest relative values. For the face (321) we obtain 2, 3, 6. This\r\nmeans that the face (321) in the top-right-front octant of the hexakis\r\noctahedron cuts off two unit lengths of axis _a_, three unit lengths of\r\naxis _b_, and six unit lengths of axis _c_. No fractional parts thus\r\never enter into the relations of the axial lengths intercepted by any\r\nface on a crystal, and the whole numbers representing these relations\r\nare always small, the number 6 being the usual limit.\r\n\r\nThis important law is known as the “Law of Rational Indices,” and is the\r\ncorner-stone of crystallography. A forecast of it was given in Chapter\r\nIII., in describing how it was first discovered by Haüy, and it was\r\nshown how impressed Haüy was with its obvious significance as an\r\nindication of the brick-like nature of the crystal structure. What the\r\n“bricks” were, Haüy was not in a position to ascertain with certainty,\r\nas chemistry was in its infancy, and Dalton’s atomic theory had not then\r\nbeen proposed.\r\n\r\nThat Haüy had a shrewd idea, however, that the structural units were the\r\nchemical molecules, and that while the main lines of symmetry were\r\ndetermined by the arrangement of the molecules its details were settled\r\nby the arrangement of the atoms in the molecules, is clear to any one\r\nwho reads his 1784 “Essai” and 1801 “Traité,” and interprets his\r\n_molécules intégrantes_ and _élémentaires_ in the light of our knowledge\r\nof to-day.\r\n\r\nBefore we pass on, however, to consider the modern development of the\r\nreal meaning of the law of rational indices, as revealed by recent work\r\non the internal structure of crystals, it will be well to consider\r\nfirst, in the next chapter, a few more essential facts as to crystal\r\nsymmetry, and the current mode of constructing a comprehensive, yet\r\nsimple, plan of the faces present on a crystal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\nTHE DISTRIBUTION OF CRYSTAL FACES IN ZONES, AND THE MODE OF CONSTRUCTING\r\n                          A PLAN OF THE FACES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will have been clear from the facts related in the previous chapters\r\nthat the salient property possessed by all crystals, when ideal\r\ndevelopment is permitted by the circumstances of their growth, and the\r\nsubstance is not one of unusual softness or liable to ready distortion,\r\nis that the exterior form consists of and is defined by truly plane\r\nfaces inclined to each other at angles which are specific and\r\ncharacteristic for each definite chemical substance; and that these\r\nangles are in accordance with the symmetry of some particular one of the\r\nthirty-two classes of crystals, and are such as cause the indices of the\r\nfaces concerned to be rational small numbers.\r\n\r\nIt will also be clear that, given the presence of any face other than\r\nthe three axial planes, the symmetry of the class—supposing the crystal\r\nto exhibit some development of symmetry and not to belong to class 32,\r\nthe general case possessing no symmetry—will require the repetition of\r\nthis face a definite number of times on other parts of the crystal. Such\r\na set of faces possessing the same symmetry value we have already learnt\r\nto call a “Form,” and the faces composing it will have the same\r\nMillerian index numbers in their symbols, but differently arranged and\r\nwith negative signs over those which relate to the interception of the\r\nback part of the _a_ axis, the left part of the _b_ axis, or the lower\r\npart of the vertical _c_ axis; that is, parts to the front and right,\r\nand above, the centre of intersection of the three crystal axes are\r\nconsidered as the positive parts of those axes.\r\n\r\nA form, if of general character, that is, if composed of faces each of\r\nwhich is inclined to all three axes, will comprise more faces the higher\r\nthe symmetry. Thus, in the cubic system, the form shown in Fig. 21, the\r\nhexakis octahedron, comprises as many as forty-eight faces, all covered\r\nby the form symbol {321}; while in the rhombic system the highest number\r\nof faces in a form is eight, in the monoclinic only four, and in the\r\ntriclinic system two. It will also have become clear that the law of\r\nrational indices limits the number of forms possible of any one type.\r\nFor instance, very few hexakis octahedra are known, the most frequently\r\noccurring ones besides {321} being {421}, {531}, and {543}. Forms, of\r\nany class, possessing higher indices than these are very rare,\r\nespecially in the systems of lower symmetry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 47.—The Spherical Projection.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe next come to a further very interesting fact about crystals. Let us\r\nimagine a crystal, on which the faces are fairly evenly developed, to be\r\nplaced in the middle of a sphere of jelly, as indicated in Fig. 47\r\n(reproduced from a Memoir by the late Prof. Penfield), so that the\r\ncentre or origin of the axial system of the crystal and the centre of\r\nthe sphere coincide. Let us now further imagine that long needles are\r\nstuck through the jelly and the crystal, one perpendicular to each\r\ncrystal face, and so as to reach the centre. The crystal represented in\r\nFig. 47 is a combination of the cube _a_, octahedron _o_, and rhombic\r\ndodecahedron _d_. If such a thing as we have imagined were possible, we\r\nshould find that the needles would emerge at the surface of the sphere\r\nin points which would lie on great circles, that is, on circles which\r\nrepresent the intersection of the sphere by planes passing through the\r\ncentre. Moreover, the points would be distributed along these circles at\r\nregularly recurring angular positions, corresponding to the symmetry of\r\nthe crystal. If the crystal belonged to one of the higher systems of\r\nsymmetry, it would happen that four of the points on at least one of\r\nthese great circles, and possibly on three of them, would be 90° apart,\r\nthat is, would be at the ends of rectangular diameters, which would most\r\nlikely be the axes of reference. The other points would be distributed\r\nsymmetrically on each side of these four points.\r\n\r\nThe great circles on which the points are thus symmetrically\r\ndistributed—and they may legitimately be taken to represent the faces,\r\nfor tangent planes to the sphere at these points would be parallel to\r\nthe faces—are known as “zone circles,” and the faces represented by the\r\npoints on any one of them form a “zone.” Now a zone of faces has this\r\npractical property, that when the crystal is supported so as to be\r\nrotatable about the zone axis—which is parallel to the edges of\r\nintersection of all the faces composing the zone, and is the normal to\r\nthe plane of the great circle representing the zone—and a telescope is\r\ndirected towards the crystal perpendicularly to the zone axis, while a\r\nbright object such as an illuminated slit is arranged conveniently so as\r\nto be reflected from any face of the crystal into the telescope, an\r\nimage of it being thus visible in the latter, then it will be found that\r\non rotating the crystal a similar image will be seen reflected in the\r\ntelescope from every face of the zone in turn. Moreover, when the\r\ncrystal is mounted on a graduated circle, the angle of rotation between\r\nthe positions of adjustment to the cross-wires of the telescope of any\r\ntwo successive images, reflected from adjacent faces of the crystal, is\r\nactually the angle between the two points representing the faces\r\nconcerned on the zone circle, and is the supplement of the internal\r\ndihedral angle between the two crystal faces themselves. It is, in fact,\r\nthe angle between the normals (perpendiculars) to the two faces, the\r\nangle which is measured on the goniometer.\r\n\r\nThis is, indeed, the very simple principle of the reflecting goniometer,\r\ninvented by Wollaston in the year 1809, and which in its modern improved\r\nform is the all-important principal instrument of the crystallographer’s\r\nlaboratory. The work with it consists largely in the measurement of the\r\nangles between the faces in all the principal zones developed on the\r\ncrystal. The very fact, however, that crystal faces occur so absolutely\r\naccurately in zones immeasurably lightens the labours of the\r\ncrystallographer, and is one of prime importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 48.—The Reflecting Goniometer.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe most accurate and convenient modern form of reflecting goniometer,\r\nreading to half-minutes of arc, and provided with a delicate adjusting\r\napparatus for the crystal, is shown in Fig. 48. It is constructed by\r\nFuess of Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe graduated circle _a_ is horizontal and is divided directly to 15′,\r\nthe verniers enabling the readings to be carried further either to\r\nsingle minutes, which is all that is usually necessary, or to\r\nhalf-minutes in the cases of very perfect crystals. The divided circle\r\nis rotated by means of the ring _b_ situated below, and the reading of\r\nthe verniers is accomplished with the aid of the microscopes _c_. The\r\ncircle which carries the verniers is not fixed, except when this is done\r\ndeliberately by means of the clamping screw _d_, but rotates with the\r\ntelescope _e_ to which it is rigidly attached by means of an arm and a\r\ncolumn _f_. A fine adjustment is provided with the clamping arrangement,\r\nso that the telescope can be adjusted delicately with respect to the\r\ndivided circle. Both telescope and collimator are rigidly fixed at about\r\n120° from each other during the actual measurements. The collimator _g_\r\nis carried on a column _h_ definitely fixed to one of the legs (the back\r\none in Fig. 48) of the main basal tripod of the instrument. The signal\r\nslit of the collimator is carried at the focus of the objective about\r\nthe middle of the tube _g_, the outer half of the latter being an\r\nillumination tube carrying a condensing lens to concentrate the rays of\r\nlight from the goniometer lamp on the slit. The latter is not of the\r\nusual rectilinear character, but composed of two circular-arc jaws, so\r\nthat, while narrow in the middle part like an ordinary spectroscope\r\nslit, it is much broader at the two ends in order to be much more\r\nreadily visible; the central part is narrow in order to enable fine\r\nadjustment to the vertical cross-wire of the telescope to be readily and\r\naccurately carried out. The shape of this signal-slit will be gathered\r\nfrom the images of the slit shown in Fig. 61 (page 126) in Chapter X.\r\nThe telescope carries an additional lens _k_ at its inner, objective,\r\nend, in order that when this lens is rotated into position the telescope\r\nmay be converted into a low power microscope for viewing the crystal and\r\nthus enabling its adjustment to be readily carried out.\r\n\r\nThe crystal _l_ is mounted on a little cone of goniometer wax (a mixture\r\nof pitch and beeswax) carried by the crystal holder. The latter fits in\r\nthe top of the adjusting movements, which consist of a pair of\r\nrectangularly arranged centring motions, and a pair of cylindrical\r\nadjusting movements; the milled-headed manipulating centring screws of\r\nthe former are indicated by the letters _m_ and _n_ in Fig. 48, and\r\nthose which move the adjusting segments are marked _o_ and _p_. The top\r\nscrew fixes the crystal holder.\r\n\r\nThe crystal on its adjusting apparatus can be raised or lowered to the\r\nproper height, level with the axes of the telescope and collimator, by\r\nmeans of a milled head at the base of the instrument, there being an\r\ninner crystal axis moving (vertically only) independently of the circle.\r\nMoreover, a second axis outside this enables the crystal to be rotated\r\nindependently of the circle, the conical axis of which is outside this\r\nagain. The two can be locked together when desired, however, by a\r\nclamping screw provided with a fine adjustment _q_. Freedom of movement\r\nof the crystal axis, unimpeded by the weight of the circle, is thus\r\npermitted for all adjusting purposes, the circle being only brought into\r\nplay when measurement is actually to occur. With this instrument the\r\nmost accurate work can be readily carried out, and for ease of\r\nmanipulation and general convenience it is the best goniometer yet\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nThe idea of regarding the centre of the crystal as the centre of a\r\nsphere, within which the crystal is placed (Fig. 47, page 62), gives\r\ncrystallographers a very convenient method of graphically representing a\r\ncrystal on paper, by projecting the sphere on to the flat surface of the\r\npaper, the eye being supposed to be placed at either the north or south\r\npole of the sphere, and the plane of projection to be that of the\r\nequatorial great circle. The faces in the upper hemisphere are\r\nrepresented by dots which are technically known as the “poles” of the\r\nfaces, corresponding to the points where the needles normal to the faces\r\nemerge from the imaginary globe, and all these points or poles lie on a\r\nfew arcs of great circles, which appear in the projection either also as\r\ncircular arcs terminating at diametrically opposite points on the\r\ncircumference of the equatorial circle, which forms the outer boundary\r\nof the figure and is termed the “primitive circle,” or else, when the\r\nplanes of the great circles are at right angles to the equatorial\r\nprimitive circle, they appear as diametral straight lines passing\r\nthrough the centre of the primitive circle.\r\n\r\nSuch a stereographic projection offers a comprehensive plan of the whole\r\nof the crystal faces, which at once informs us of the symmetry in all\r\ncases other than very complicated ones. A typical one, that of the\r\nrhombic crystal of topaz shown in Fig. 22 (page 40), is given in Fig.\r\n49.\r\n\r\nIt will happen in all cases of higher symmetry, as in that of topaz, for\r\ninstance, that the poles in the lower hemisphere will project into the\r\nsame points as those representing the faces in the upper hemisphere; but\r\nin cases of lower symmetry, where they are differently situated, they\r\nare usually represented by miniature rings instead of dots. From the\r\ninterfacial angles measured on the goniometer the relative lengths and\r\nangular inclinations (if other than 90°) of the crystal axes can readily\r\nbe calculated, by means of the simple formulæ of spherical trigonometry;\r\nand the stereographic projection constructed from the measurements as\r\njust described proves an inestimable aid to these calculations, by\r\naffording a comprehensive diagram of all the spherical triangles\r\nrequired in making the calculations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 49.—Stereographic Projection of Topaz.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe relative axial lengths _a_ : _b_ : _c_ (in which _b_ is always\r\narranged to be = 1), and the axial angles α (between _b_ and _c_), β\r\n(between _a_ and _c_), and γ (between _a_ and _b_), form the “elements”\r\nof a crystal. These, together with a list of the “forms” observed, and a\r\ntable of the interfacial angles, define the morphology of the crystal,\r\nand are included in every satisfactory description of a crystallographic\r\ninvestigation. They are preceded by a statement of the name and chemical\r\ncomposition and formula of the substance, the system and the class of\r\nsymmetry, and the habit or various habits developed by crystals from a\r\nconsiderable number of crops. An example of the mode of setting out such\r\na description will be found on pages 157 to 160.\r\n\r\nHaving thus made ourselves acquainted with the real nature of the\r\ndistribution of faces on a crystal, and learnt how the crystallographer\r\nmeasures the angles between the faces by means of the reflecting\r\ngoniometer, plots them out graphically on a stereographic projection,\r\nand calculates therefrom the “elements” of the crystal, it will be\r\nconvenient again to take up the historical development of the subject so\r\nfar as it relates to crystal forms and angles, and their bearing on the\r\nchemical composition of the substance composing the crystal, by\r\nintroducing the reader to the great work of Mitscherlich, whose\r\ninfluence in the domain of chemical crystallography was as profound as\r\nthat of Haüy proved to be as regards structural crystallography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n  THE WORK OF EILHARDT MITSCHERLICH AND HIS DISCOVERY OF ISOMORPHISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the height of the French Revolution, which caused the work of the\r\nAbbe Haüy to be suspended for a time, although he was fortunately not\r\none of the many scientific victims of that terrible period, there was\r\nborn, on the 7th of January 1794, in the village of Neuende, near Jever,\r\nin Oldenburg, the man who was destined to continue that work on its\r\nchemical side. Eilhardt Mitscherlich was the son of the village pastor,\r\nand nephew of the celebrated philologer, Prof. Mitscherlich of\r\nGöttingen. His uncle’s influence appears to have given young\r\nMitscherlich a leaning towards philological studies, for during his\r\nlater terms at the Gymnasium at Jever, where he received his early\r\neducation, he devoted himself with great energy to the study of history\r\nand languages, for which he had a marked talent, under the able\r\ndirection and kind solicitude of the head of the Gymnasium at that time,\r\nthe historian Schlosser. He eventually specialised on the Persian\r\nlanguage, and when Schlosser was promoted to Frankfort young\r\nMitscherlich accompanied him, and there prosecuted these favourite\r\nstudies until the year 1811, when he went to the university of\r\nHeidelberg.\r\n\r\nFor some time now he had cherished the hope of proceeding to Persia and\r\nconducting philological investigations on the spot, and in 1813, an\r\nopportunity presenting itself in the prospect of an embassy being\r\ndespatched to Persia by Napoleon, he transferred himself to the\r\nuniversity of Paris, with the object of obtaining permission from\r\nNapoleon to accompany the embassy. This visit to Paris must have been\r\none of Mitscherlich’s most exciting and interesting experiences. For\r\nNapoleon had just returned from the disastrous Russian campaign of 1812,\r\nand was feverishly engaged in raising a new army wherewith to stem the\r\ngreat rise of the people which was now re-awakening patriotic spirit\r\nthroughout the whole of Germany, and which threatened to sweep away, as\r\nit eventually did, the huge fabric of his central European Empire.\r\n\r\nIndeed Mitscherlich appears to have been detained in Paris during the\r\nexciting years 1813 and 1814, and with the abdication of Napoleon on\r\nApril 4th of that year, he was obliged to give up all idea of proceeding\r\nto Persia. He decided that the only way of accomplishing his purpose was\r\nto attempt to travel thither as a doctor of medicine. He therefore\r\nreturned to his native Germany during the summer of 1814, and proceeded\r\nto Göttingen, which was then famous for its medical school. Here he\r\nworked hard at the preliminary science subjects necessary for the\r\nmedical degree, while still continuing his philology to such serious\r\npurpose as to enable him to publish, in 1815, the first volume of a\r\nhistory of the Ghurides and Kara-Chitayens, entitled “Mirchondi historia\r\nThaheridarum.” It is obvious from the sequel, however, that he very soon\r\nbegan to take much more than a merely passing interest in his scientific\r\nstudies, and he eventually became so fascinated by them, and\r\nparticularly chemistry, as to abandon altogether his cherished idea of a\r\nvisit to Persia. Europe was now settling down after the stormy period of\r\nthe hundred days which succeeded Napoleon’s escape from Elba,\r\nterminating in his final overthrow on June 18th, 1815, at Waterloo, and\r\nMitscherlich was able to devote himself to the uninterrupted prosecution\r\nof the scientific work now opening before him. He had the inestimable\r\nadvantage of bringing to it a culture and a literary mind of quite an\r\nunusually broad and original character; and if the fall of Napoleon\r\nbrought with it the loss to the world of an accomplished philologist, it\r\nbrought also an ample compensation in conferring upon it one of the most\r\nerudite and broad-minded of scientists.\r\n\r\nIn 1818 Mitscherlich went to Berlin, and worked hard at chemistry in the\r\nuniversity laboratory under Link. It was about the close of this year or\r\nthe beginning of 1819 that he commenced his first research, and it\r\nproved to be one which will ever be memorable in the annals both of\r\nchemistry and of crystallography. He had undertaken the investigation of\r\nthe phosphates and arsenates, and his results confirmed the conclusions\r\nwhich had just been published by Berzelius, then the greatest chemist of\r\nthe day, namely, that the anhydrides of phosphoric and arsenic acids\r\neach contain five equivalents of oxygen, while those of the lower\r\nphosphorous and arsenious acids contain only three. But while making\r\npreparations of the salts of these acids, which they form when combined\r\nwith potash and ammonia, he observed a fact which had escaped Berzelius,\r\nnamely, that the phosphates and arsenates of potassium and ammonium\r\n_crystallise in similar forms_, the crystals being so like each other,\r\nin fact, as to be indistinguishable on a merely cursory inspection.\r\n\r\nBeing unacquainted with crystallography, and perceiving the importance\r\nof the subject to the chemist, he acted in a very practical and sensible\r\nmanner, which it is more than singular has not been universally imitated\r\nby all chemists since his time. He at once commenced the study of\r\ncrystallography, seeing the impossibility of further real progress\r\nwithout a working knowledge of that subject. He was fortunate in finding\r\nin Gustav Rose, the Professor of Geology and Mineralogy at Berlin, not\r\nmerely a teacher close at hand, but also eventually a life-long intimate\r\nfriend. Mitscherlich worked so hard under Rose that he was very soon\r\nable to carry out the necessary crystal measurements with his newly\r\nprepared phosphates and arsenates. He first established the complete\r\nmorphological similarity of the acid phosphates and arsenates of\r\nammonium, those which have the composition NH_{4}H_{2}PO_{4} and\r\nNH_{4}H_{2}AsO_{4} and crystallise in primary tetragonal prisms\r\nterminated by the primary pyramid faces; and then he endeavoured to\r\nproduce other salts of ammonia with other acids which should likewise\r\ngive crystals of similar form. But he found this to be impossible, and\r\nthat only the phosphates and arsenates of ammonia exhibited the same\r\ncrystalline forms, composed of faces inclined at similar angles, which\r\nto Mitscherlich at this time appeared to be identical. He next tried the\r\neffect of combining phosphoric and arsenic acids with other bases, and\r\nhe found that potassium gave salts which crystallised apparently exactly\r\nlike the ammonium salts.\r\n\r\nHe then discovered that not only do the acid phosphates and arsenates of\r\npotassium and ammonium, H_{2}KPO_{4}, H_{2}(NH_{4})PO_{4},\r\nH_{2}KAsO_{4}, and H_{2}(NH_{4})AsO_{4} crystallise in similar\r\ntetragonal forms, but also that the four neutral di-metallic salts of\r\nthe type HK_{2}PO_{4} crystallise similarly to each other.\r\n\r\nHe came, therefore, to the conclusion that there do exist bodies of\r\ndissimilar chemical composition having the same crystalline form, but\r\nthat these substances are of similar constitution, in which one element,\r\nor group of elements, may be exchanged for another which appears to act\r\nanalogously, such as arsenic for phosphorus and the ammonium group\r\n(although its true nature was not then determined) for potassium. He\r\nobserved that certain minerals also appeared to conform to this rule,\r\nsuch as the rhombohedral carbonates of the alkaline earths, calcite\r\nCaCO_{3}, dolomite CaMg(CO_{3})_{2}, chalybite FeCO_{3}, and dialogite\r\nMnCO_{3}; and the orthorhombic sulphates of barium (barytes, BaSO_{4}),\r\nstrontium (celestite, SrSO_{4}), and lead (anglesite, PbSO_{4}).\r\nWollaston, who, in the year 1809, had invented the reflecting\r\ngoniometer, and thereby placed a much more powerful weapon of research\r\nin the hands of crystallographers, had already, in 1812, shown this to\r\nbe a fact as regards the orthorhombic carbonates (witherite,\r\nstrontianite, and cerussite) and sulphates (barytes, celestite, and\r\nanglesite) of barium, strontium, and lead, as the result of the first\r\nexact angular measurements made with his new instrument; but his\r\nobservations had been almost ignored until Mitscherlich reinstated them\r\nby his confirmatory results.\r\n\r\nWhile working under the direction of Rose, Mitscherlich had become\r\nacquainted with the work of Haüy, whose ideas were being very much\r\ndiscussed about this time, Haüy himself taking a very strong part in the\r\ndiscussion, being particularly firm on the principle that every\r\nsubstance of definite chemical composition is characterised by its own\r\nspecific crystalline form. Such a principle appeared to be flatly\r\ncontradicted by these first surprising results of Mitscherlich, and it\r\nnaturally appeared desirable to the latter largely to extend his\r\nobservations to other salts of different groups. It was for this reason\r\nthat he had examined the orthorhombic sulphates of barium, strontium,\r\nand lead, and the rhombohedral carbonates of calcium, magnesium, iron,\r\nand manganese, with the result already stated that the members of each\r\nof these groups of salts were found to exhibit the same crystalline\r\nform, a fact as regards the former group of sulphates which had already\r\nbeen pointed out not only by Wollaston but by von Fuchs (who appears to\r\nhave ignored the work of Wollaston) in 1815, but had been explained by\r\nhim in a totally unsatisfactory manner. Moreover, about the same time\r\nthe vitriols, the sulphates of zinc, iron, and copper, had been\r\ninvestigated by Beudant, who had shown that under certain conditions\r\nmixed crystals of these salts could be obtained; but Beudant omitted to\r\nanalyse his salts, and thus missed discovering the all-important fact\r\nthat the vitriols contain water of crystallisation, and in different\r\namounts under normal conditions. Green vitriol, the sulphate of ferrous\r\niron, crystallises usually with seven molecules of water of\r\ncrystallisation, as does also white vitriol, zinc sulphate; but blue\r\nvitriol, copper sulphate, crystallises with only five molecules of water\r\nunder ordinary atmospheric conditions of temperature and pressure.\r\nMoreover, copper sulphate forms crystals which belong to the triclinic\r\nsystem, while the sulphates of zinc and iron are dimorphous, the common\r\nform of zinc sulphate, ZnSO_{4}.7H_{2}O, being rhombic, like Epsom\r\nsalts, the sulphate of magnesia which also crystallises with seven\r\nmolecules of water, MgSO_{4}.7H_{2}O, while that of ferrous sulphate,\r\nFeSO_{4}.7H_{2}O, is monoclinic, facts which still further complicate\r\nthe crystallography of this group and which were quite unknown to\r\nBeudant and were unobserved by him. But Beudant showed that the addition\r\nof fifteen per cent. of ferrous sulphate to zinc sulphate, or nine per\r\ncent. to copper sulphate, caused either zinc or copper sulphate to\r\ncrystallise in the same monoclinic form as ferrous sulphate. He also\r\nshowed that all three vitriols will crystallise in mixed crystals with\r\nmagnesium or nickel sulphates, the ordinary form of the latter salt,\r\nNiSO_{4}.7H_{2}O, being rhombic like that of Epsom salts.\r\n\r\nThe idea that two chemically distinct substances not crystallising in\r\nthe cubic system, where the high symmetry determines identity of form,\r\ncan occur in crystals of the same form, was most determinedly combated\r\nby Haüy, and the lack of chemical analyses in Beudant’s work, and the\r\naltogether incorrect “vicarious” explanation given by von Fuchs, gave\r\nHaüy very grave cause for suspicion of the new ideas. The previous\r\nobservations of Rome de l’Isle in 1772, Le Blanc in 1784, Vauquelin in\r\n1797, and of Gay-Lussac in 1816, that the various alums, potash alum,\r\nammonia alum, and iron alum, will grow together in mixed crystals or in\r\novergrowths of one crystal on another, when a crystal of any one of them\r\nis hung up in the solution of any other, does not affect the question,\r\nas the alums crystallise in the cubic system, the angles of the highly\r\nsymmetric forms of which are absolutely identical by virtue of the\r\nsymmetry itself.\r\n\r\nIt was while this interesting discussion was proceeding that\r\nMitscherlich was at work in Berlin, extending his first researches on\r\nthe phosphates and arsenates to the mineral sulphates and carbonates.\r\nBut he recognised, even thus early, what has since become very clear,\r\nnamely, that owing to the possibility of the enclosure of impurities and\r\nof admixture with isomorphous analogues, minerals are not so suitable\r\nfor investigation in this regard as the crystals of artificially\r\nprepared chemical salts. For the latter can be prepared in the\r\nlaboratory in a state of definitely ascertained purity, and there is no\r\nchance of that happening which Haüy was inclined to think was the\r\nexplanation of Mitscherlich’s results, namely, that certain salts have\r\nsuch an immense power of crystallisation that a small proportion of them\r\nin a solution of another salt may coerce the latter into crystallisation\r\nin the form of that more powerfully crystallising salt. Mitscherlich\r\nmade a special study, therefore, of the work of Beudant, and repeated\r\nthe latter observer’s experiments, bringing to the research both his\r\ncrystallographic experience and that of a skilful analyst. He prepared\r\nthe pure sulphates of ferrous iron, copper, zinc, magnesium, nickel and\r\ncobalt, all of which form excellent crystals. He soon cleared up the\r\nmystery in which Beudant’s work had left the subject, by showing that\r\nthe crystals contained water of crystallisation, and in different\r\namounts. He found what has since been abundantly verified, that the\r\nsulphates of copper and manganese crystallise in the triclinic system\r\nwith five molecules of water, CuSO_{4}.5H_{2}O and MnSO_{4}.5H_{2}O; in\r\nthe case of manganese sulphate, however, this is only true when the\r\ntemperature is between 7° and 20°, for if lower than 7° rhombic crystals\r\nof MnSO_{4}.7H_{2}O similar to those of the magnesium sulphate group are\r\ndeposited, and if higher than 20° the crystals are tetragonal and\r\npossess the composition MnSO_{4}.4H_{2}O. The Epsom salts group\r\ncrystallising in the rhombic system with seven molecules of water\r\nconsists of magnesium sulphate itself, MgSO_{4}.7H_{2}O, zinc sulphate\r\nZnSO_{4}.7H_{2}O, and nickel sulphate NiSO_{4}.7H_{2}O. The third group\r\nof Mitscherlich consists of sulphate of ferrous iron FeSO_{4}.7H_{2}O\r\nand cobalt sulphate CoSO_{4}.7H_{2}O, and both crystallise at ordinary\r\ntemperatures with seven molecules of water as indicated by the formulæ,\r\nbut in the monoclinic system. Thus two of the groups contain the same\r\nnumber of molecules of water, yet crystallise differently. But\r\nMitscherlich next noticed a very singular fact, namely, that if a\r\ncrystal of a member of either of these two groups be dropped into a\r\nsaturated solution of a salt of the other group, this latter salt will\r\ncrystallise out in the form of the group to which the stranger crystal\r\nbelongs. Hence he concluded that both groups are capable of\r\ncrystallising in two different systems, rhombic and monoclinic, and that\r\nunder the ordinary circumstances of temperature and pressure three of\r\nthe salts form most readily the rhombic crystals, while the other two\r\ntake up most easily the monoclinic form. Mitscherlich then mixed the\r\nsolutions of the different salts, and found that the mixed crystals\r\nobtained presented the form of some one of the salts employed. Thus even\r\nso early in his work Mitscherlich indicated the possibility of\r\ndimorphism. Moreover, before the close of the year 1819 he had satisfied\r\nhimself that aragonite is a second distinct form of carbonate of lime,\r\ncrystallising in the rhombic system and quite different from the\r\nordinary rhombohedral form calcite. Hence this was another undoubted\r\ncase of dimorphism.\r\n\r\nDuring this same investigation in 1819, Mitscherlich studied the effect\r\nproduced by mixing the solution of each one of the above-mentioned seven\r\nsulphates of dyad-acting metals with the solution of sulphate of potash,\r\nand made the very important discovery that a double salt of definite\r\ncomposition was produced, containing one equivalent of potassium\r\nsulphate, one equivalent of the dyad sulphate (that of magnesium, zinc,\r\niron, manganese, nickel, cobalt, or copper), and six equivalents of\r\nwater of crystallisation, and that they all crystallised well in similar\r\nforms belonging to the monoclinic system. Some typical crystals of one\r\nof these salts, ammonium magnesium sulphate, are illustrated in Fig. 30\r\n(Plate VII., facing page 44). This is probably the most important series\r\nof double salts known to us, and is the series which has formed the\r\nsubject of prolonged investigation on the part of the author, no less\r\nthan thirty-four different members of the series having been studied\r\ncrystallographically and physically since the year 1893, and many other\r\nmembers still remain to be studied. An account of this work is given in\r\na Monograph published in the year 1910 by Messrs Macmillan & Co., and\r\nentitled, “Crystalline Structure and Chemical Constitution.”\r\n\r\nThis remarkable record for a first research was presented by\r\nMitscherlich to the Berlin Academy on the 9th December 1819. During the\r\nsummer of the same year Berzelius visited Berlin, and was so struck with\r\nthe abilities of Mitscherlich, then twenty-five years old, that he\r\npersuaded him to accompany him on his return to Stockholm, and\r\nMitscherlich continued his investigations there under the eye of the\r\ngreat chemist. His first work at Stockholm consisted of a more complete\r\nstudy of the acid and neutral phosphates and arsenates of potash, soda,\r\nammonia, and lead. He showed that in every case an arsenate crystallises\r\nin the same form as the corresponding phosphate. Moreover, in 1821 he\r\ndemonstrated that sodium dihydrogen phosphate, NaH_{2}PO_{4},\r\ncrystallises with a molecule of water of crystallisation in two\r\ndifferent forms, both belonging to the rhombic system but with quite\r\ndifferent axial ratios; this was consequently a similar occurrence to\r\nthat which he had observed with the sulphates of the iron and zinc\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nIt was while Mitscherlich was in Stockholm that Berzelius suggested to\r\nhim that a name should be given to the new discovery that analogous\r\nelements can replace each other in their crystallised compounds without\r\nany apparent change of crystalline form. Mitscherlich, therefore, termed\r\nthe phenomenon “isomorphism,” from ἰσός, equal to, and μορφή, shape. The\r\nterm “isomorphous” thus strictly means “equal shaped,” implying not only\r\nsimilarity in the faces displayed, but also absolute equality of the\r\ncrystal angles. The fact that the crystals of isomorphous substances are\r\nnot absolutely identical in form, but only very similar, was not likely\r\nto be appreciated by Mitscherlich at this time. For the reflecting\r\ngoniometer had only been invented by Wollaston in 1809, and accurate\r\ninstruments reading to minutes of arc were mechanical rarities. It will\r\nbe shown in the sequel, as the result of the author’s investigations,\r\nthat there _are_ angular differences, none the less real because\r\nrelatively very small, between the members of such series. But\r\nMitscherlich was not in the position to observe them. It must be\r\nremembered, moreover, that he was primarily a chemist, and that he had\r\nonly acquired sufficient crystallographic knowledge to enable him to\r\ndetect the system of symmetry, and the principal forms (groups of faces\r\nhaving equal value as regards the symmetry) developed on the crystals\r\nwhich he prepared. His doctrine of isomorphism, accepted in this broad\r\nsense, proved of immediate and important use in chemistry. For there\r\nwere uncertainties as to the equivalents of some of the chemical\r\nelements, as tabulated by Berzelius, then the greatest authority on the\r\nsubject, and these were at once cleared up by the application of the\r\nprinciple of isomorphism.\r\n\r\nThe essence of Mitscherlich’s discovery was, that the chemical nature of\r\nthe elements present in a compound influences the crystalline form by\r\ndetermining the number and the arrangement of the atoms in the molecule\r\nof the compound; so that elements having similar properties, such for\r\ninstance as barium, strontium, and calcium, or phosphorus and arsenic,\r\ncombine with other elements to form similarly constituted compounds,\r\nboth as regards number of atoms and their arrangement in the molecule.\r\nNumber of atoms alone, however, is no criterion, for the five atoms of\r\nthe ammonium group NH_{4} replace the one atom of potassium without\r\nchange of form.\r\n\r\nThis case of the base ammonia had been one of Mitscherlich’s greatest\r\ndifficulties during the earlier part of his work, and remained a\r\ncomplete puzzle until about this time, when its true chemical character\r\nwas revealed. For until the year 1820 Berzelius believed that it\r\ncontained oxygen. Seebeck and Berzelius had independently discovered\r\nammonium amalgam in 1808, and Davy found, on repeating the experiment,\r\nthat a piece of sal-ammoniac moistened with water produced the amalgam\r\nwith mercury just as well as strong aqueous ammonia. Both Berzelius and\r\nDavy came to the conclusion that ammonia contains oxygen, like potash\r\nand soda, and that a metallic kind of substance resembling the alkali\r\nmetals, potassium and sodium, was isolated from this oxide or hydrate by\r\nthe action of the electric current, which Seebeck had shown facilitated\r\nthe formation of the so-called ammonium amalgam. Davy, however, accepted\r\nin part the views of Gay-Lussac and Thénard, who, in 1809, concluded\r\nfrom their experiments that ammonium consisted of ammonia gas NH_{3}\r\nwith an additional atom of hydrogen, the group NH_{4} then acting like\r\nan alkali metal, views which time has substantiated. But their further\r\nerroneous conclusion that sodium and potassium also contained hydrogen\r\nwas rejected by him. Berzelius, however, set his face both against this\r\nlatter fallacy and the really correct NH_{4} theory, and it was not\r\nuntil four years after Ampère, in 1816, had shown that sal-ammoniac was,\r\nin fact, the compound of the group NH_{4} with chlorine, that Berzelius,\r\nabout the year 1820, after thoroughly sifting the work of Ampère,\r\naccepted the view of the latter that in the ammonium salts it is the\r\ngroup NH_{4}, acting as a radicle capable of replacing the alkali\r\nmetals, which is present.\r\n\r\nThe fact that this occurred at this precise moment, four years after the\r\npublication of Ampère’s results, leads to the conclusion that the\r\nobservation of Mitscherlich, that the ammonium compounds are isomorphous\r\nwith the potassium compounds, was the compelling argument which caused\r\nBerzelius finally to admit what has since proved to be the truth.\r\n\r\nWhile still at Stockholm Mitscherlich showed that the chromates and\r\nmanganates are isomorphous with the sulphates, and also that the\r\nperchlorates and permanganates are isomorphous with each other. Although\r\nthese facts could not be properly explained at the time, owing to the\r\ninadequate progress of the chemistry of manganese, it was seen that\r\npotassium chromate, K_{2}CrO_{4}, contained the same number of atoms as\r\npotassium sulphate, K_{2}SO_{4}, and that potassium permanganate\r\nKMnO_{4} and perchlorate KClO_{4} likewise resembled each other in\r\nregard to the number of atoms contained in the molecule.\r\n\r\nAs a good instance of the use of the principle of isomorphism, we may\r\nrecall that when Marignac, in 1864, found himself in great difficulty\r\nabout the atomic weights of the little known metals tantalum and niobium\r\nwhich he was investigating, he discovered that their compounds are\r\nisomorphous; the pentoxides of the two metals occur together in\r\nisomorphous mixture in several minerals, and the double fluorides with\r\npotassium fluoride, K_{2}TaF_{7} and K_{2}NbF_{7} are readily obtained\r\nin crystals of the same form. The specific heat of tantalum was then\r\nunknown, so that the law of Dulong and Petit connecting specific heat\r\nwith atomic weight could not be applied, and the vapour density of\r\ntantalum chloride, as first determined by Deville and Troost with impure\r\nmaterial, did not indicate an atomic weight for tantalum which would\r\ngive it the position among the elements that the chemical reactions of\r\nthe metal indicated. Yet Marignac was able definitely to decide, some\r\ntime before the final vapour density determinations of Deville and\r\nTroost with pure salts, from the fact of the isomorphism of their\r\ncompounds, that the only possible positions for tantalum and niobium\r\nwere such as corresponded with the atomic weights 180 and 93\r\nrespectively. Time has only confirmed this decision, and we now know\r\nthat niobium and tantalum belong to the same family group of elements as\r\nthat to which vanadium belongs, and the only difference which modern\r\nresearch has introduced has been to correct the decimal places of the\r\natomic weights, that of niobium (now also called columbium, the name\r\ngiven to it by its discoverer, Hatchett, in 1801) being now accepted as\r\n92.8 and that of tantalum 179.6, when that of hydrogen = 1.\r\n\r\nApplying the law of isomorphism in a similar manner, Berzelius was\r\nenabled to fix the atomic weights of copper, cadmium, zinc, nickel,\r\ncobalt, iron, manganese, chromium, sulphur, selenium, and chlorine, the\r\nnumbers accepted to-day differing only in the decimal places, in\r\naccordance with the more accurate results acquired by the advance of\r\nexperimental and quantitative analytical methods. But with regard to\r\nseveral other elements, owing to inadequate data, Berzelius made serious\r\nmistakes, showing how very great is the necessity for care and for ample\r\nexperimental data and accurate measurements, before the principle of\r\nisomorphism can be applied with safety. Given these, and we have one of\r\nthe most valuable of all the aids known to us in choosing the correct\r\natomic weight of an element from among two or three possible\r\nalternatives. We are only on absolutely sure ground when we are dealing\r\nnot only with a series of compounds consisting of the same number of\r\natoms, but when also the interchangeable elements are the intimately\r\nrelated members of a family group, such as we have since become familiar\r\nwith in the vertical groups of elements in the periodic table of\r\nMendeléeff.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Stockholm Mitscherlich showed, from experiments on the\r\ncrystallisation of mixtures of the different sulphates with which he had\r\nbeen working, that isomorphous substances intermix in crystals in all\r\nproportions, and that they also replace one another in minerals in\r\nindefinite proportions, a fact which has of recent years been\r\nwonderfully exemplified in the cases of the hornblende (amphibole) and\r\naugite (pyroxene) groups.\r\n\r\nIn November 1821 Mitscherlich closed these memorable labours at\r\nStockholm and returned to Berlin, where he acted as extraordinary\r\nprofessor of the university until 1825, when he was elected professor in\r\nordinary. His investigations for a time were largely connected with\r\nminerals, but on July 6th, 1826, he presented a further most important\r\ncrystallographic paper to the Berlin Academy, in which he announced his\r\ndiscovery of the fact that one of the best known chemical elements,\r\nsulphur, is capable of crystallising in two distinct forms. The ordinary\r\ncrystals found about Etna and Vesuvius and in other volcanic regions\r\nagree with those deposited from solution in carbon bisulphide in\r\nexhibiting rhombic symmetry. But Mitscherlich found that when sulphur is\r\nfused and allowed to cool until partially solidified, and the still\r\nliquid portion is then poured out of the crucible, the walls of the\r\nlatter are found to be lined with long monoclinic prisms. These have\r\nalready been illustrated in Fig. 2, Plate I., in Chapter I.\r\n\r\nHere was a perfectly clear case of an element—not liable to any charge\r\nof difference of chemical composition such as might have applied to the\r\ncases of sodium dihydrogen phosphate, carbonate of lime, and iron\r\nvitriol and its analogues, which he had previously described as cases of\r\nthe same substance crystallising in two different forms—which could be\r\nmade to crystallise in two different systems of symmetry at will, by\r\nmerely changing the circumstances under which the crystallisation\r\noccurred. His explanation being thus proved absolutely, he no longer\r\nhesitated, but at once applied the term “dimorphous” to these substances\r\nexhibiting two different forms, and referred to the phenomenon itself as\r\n“dimorphism.” The case of carbonate of lime had given rise to prolonged\r\ndiscussion, for the second variety, the rhombic aragonite, had been\r\nerroneously explained by Stromeyer, after Mitscherlich’s first\r\nannouncement in 1819, as being due to its containing strontia as well as\r\nlime, and the controversy raged until Buchholz discovered a specimen of\r\naragonite which was absolutely pure calcium carbonate, so that\r\nMitscherlich’s dimorphous explanation was fully substantiated.\r\n\r\nDimorphism is very beautifully illustrated by the case of the trioxide\r\nof antimony, Sb_{2}O_{3}, a slide of which, obtained by sublimation of\r\nthe oxide from a heated tube on to the cool surface of a glass\r\nmicroscope slip, is seen reproduced in Fig. 50, Plate XI. The two forms\r\nare respectively rhombic and cubic. The rhombic variety usually takes\r\nthe form of long needle-shaped crystals, which are shown in Fig. 50\r\nradiating across the field and interlacing with one another; the cubic\r\nvariety crystallises in octahedra, of which several are shown in the\r\nillustration, perched on the needles, one interesting individual being\r\npoised on the end of one of the needles. The two forms occur also in\r\nnature as the rhombic mineral valentinite and the cubic mineral\r\nsenarmontite, which latter crystallises in excellent regular octahedra.\r\nAntimonious oxide, moreover, is not only isomorphous, but isodimorphous\r\nwith arsenious oxide, a slide of octahedra of which has already been\r\nreproduced in Fig. 3, Plate I., in Chapter I. For besides this common\r\noctahedral form of As_{2}O_{3} artificial crystals of arsenious oxide\r\nhave been prepared of rhombic symmetry, resembling valentinite. Hence\r\nthe two lower oxides of arsenic and antimony afford us a striking case\r\nof the simultaneous display of Mitscherlich’s two principles of\r\nisomorphism and dimorphism.\r\n\r\nThus the position in 1826 was that Mitscherlich had discovered the\r\nprinciple of isomorphism, and had also shown the occurrence of\r\ndimorphism in several well-proved specific cases, and that he regarded\r\nat this time isomorphism as being a literal reality, absolute identity\r\nof form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XI._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 50.—Rhombic Needles and Cubic Octahedra of Antimony Trioxide\r\n    obtained by Sublimation.

Mitscherlich, however, soon expressed doubts as to the\r\nabsolute identity of form of his isomorphous crystals, and saw that it\r\nwas quite possible that in the systems other than the cubic (in which\r\nlatter system the highly perfect symmetry itself determines the form,\r\nand that the angles shall be identically constant), there might be\r\nslight distinctive differences in the crystal angles. For he caused to\r\nbe constructed, by the celebrated optician and mechanician, Pistor, the\r\nmost accurate goniometer which had up till then been seen, provided with\r\nfour verniers, each reading to ten seconds of arc, and with a telescope\r\nmagnifying twenty times, for viewing the reflections of a signal,\r\ncarried by a collimator, from the crystal faces. Unfortunately in one\r\nrespect, he was almost at once diverted, by the very excess of\r\nrefinement of this instrument, to the question of the alteration of the\r\ncrystal angles by change of temperature, and lost the opportunity, never\r\nto recur, of doing that which would at once have reconciled his views\r\nwith those of Haüy in regard to this important matter, namely, the\r\ndetermination of these small but real differences in the crystal angles\r\nof the different members of isomorphous series, and the discovery of the\r\ninteresting law which governs them, a task which in these later days has\r\nfallen to the lot of the author.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable piece of crystallographic work, this time in the\r\noptical domain, which has rendered the name of Mitscherlich familiar,\r\nwas his discovery of the phenomenon of crossed-axial-plane dispersion of\r\nthe optic axes in gypsum. (The nature and meaning of “optic axes” will\r\nbe explained in Chapter XIII., page 185.) During the course of a lecture\r\nto the Berlin Academy in the year 1826 Mitscherlich, always a brilliant\r\nlecturer and experimenter at the lecture table, exhibited an experiment\r\nwith a crystal of gypsum (selenite) which has ever since been referred\r\nto as the “Mitscherlich experiment.” He had been investigating the\r\ndouble refraction of a number of crystalline substances at different\r\ntemperatures, and had observed that gypsum, hydrated calcium sulphate,\r\nCaSO_{4}.2H_{2}O, was highly sensitive in this respect, especially as\r\nregards the position of its optic axes. At the ordinary temperature it\r\nis biaxial, with an optic axial angle of about 60°, but on heating the\r\ncrystal the angle diminishes, until just above the temperature of\r\nboiling water the axes become identical, as if the crystal were\r\nuniaxial, and then they again separate as the temperature rises further,\r\nbut in the plane at right angles to that which formerly contained them;\r\nhence the phenomenon is spoken of as “crossed-axial-plane dispersion.”\r\nMitscherlich employed a plate of the crystal cut perpendicularly to the\r\nbisectrix of the optic axial angle, and showed to the Academy the\r\ninterference figures (see Plate XII.) which it afforded in convergent\r\npolarised light with rising temperature. At first, for the ordinary\r\ntemperature, the usual rings and lemniscates surrounding the two optic\r\naxes were apparent at the right and left margins of the field; as the\r\ncrystal was gently heated (its supporting metallic frame being heated\r\nwith a spirit lamp) the axes approached each other, with ever changing\r\nplay of colour and alteration of shape of the rings and lemniscates,\r\nuntil eventually the dark hyperbolic brushes, marking by their well\r\ndefined vertices the positions of the two optic axes within the\r\ninnermost rings, united in the centre of the field to produce the\r\nuniaxial dark rectangular cross; the rings around the centre had now\r\nbecome circles, the lemniscates having first become ellipses which more\r\nand more approximated, as the temperature rose, to circles. Then the\r\ndark cross opened out again, and the axial brushes separated once more,\r\nbut in the vertical direction, and the circles became again first\r\nellipses and then lemniscates, eventually developing inner rings around\r\nthe optic axes; if the source of heat were not removed at this stage the\r\ncrystal would suddenly decompose, becoming dehydrated, and the field on\r\nthe screen would become dark. If, however, the spirit lamp were removed\r\nbefore this occurred, the phenomena were repeated in the reverse order\r\nas the crystal cooled.\r\n\r\nThis beautiful experiment is now frequently performed, as gypsum is\r\nperhaps the best example yet known which exhibits the phenomenon of\r\ncrossed-axial-plane dispersion by change of temperature alone. A\r\nconsiderable number of other cases are known, such as brookite, the\r\nrhombic form of titanium dioxide TiO_{2}, and the triple tartrate of\r\npotassium, sodium, and ammonium, but these are more sensitive to change\r\nof wave-length in the illuminating light than to change of temperature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 51.—The Mitscherlich Experiment with Gypsum.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XII._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 52.—Appearance of the Interference Figure half a Minute after\r\n    commencing the Experiment.

The convergence of the rays is so true on a single spot in\r\nthe centre of the crystal plate about two millimetres diameter, that a\r\ncrystal plate not exceeding 6 mm. is of adequate size, mounted in a\r\nminiature holder-frame of platinum or brass with an aperture not more\r\nthan 3 mm; the thickness of the crystal should remain about 2 mm., in\r\norder that the rings round the axes may not be too large and diffuse,\r\nthe crystal being endowed with very feeble double refraction, which is\r\none of the causes of the phenomenon. Such a small crystal heats up so\r\nrapidly in the heat rays accompanying the converging light rays—even\r\nwith the essential cold water cell two inches thick between the lantern\r\ncondenser and the polarising Nicol, for the protection of the balsam of\r\nthe latter—that any extraneous heating by a spirit or other lamp is\r\nentirely unnecessary. The moment the electric arc of the lantern is\r\nswitched on, the optic axial rings appear at the right and left margins\r\nof the screen, when the crystal is properly adjusted and the arc\r\ncorrectly centred, and they march rapidly to the crossing point in the\r\ncentre, where the dark hyperbolæ unite to produce the rectangular St\r\nAndrew’s cross, the rings, figure-eight curves, and other lemniscates\r\npassing through the most exquisite evolutions and colour changes all the\r\ntime until they form the circular Newton’s rings, around the centre of\r\nthe cross; after this the cross and circles again open out, but along\r\nthe vertical diameter of the screen, into hyperbolæ and rings and\r\nloop-like lemniscates surrounding two axes once more. It is wise as soon\r\nas the separation in this plane is complete and the first or second\r\nseparate rings have appeared round the axes, to arrest the heating by\r\nmerely interposing intermittently a hand screen between the lantern and\r\npolariser, or by blowing a current of cool air past the crystal, which\r\nwill cause the axes to recede again, and the phenomena to be reversed,\r\nthe crossing point being repassed, and the axes brought into the\r\noriginal horizontal plane again. By manipulation of the screen, or\r\nair-current, the axes can thus be caused to approach or to recede from\r\nthe centre at will, along either the horizontal or vertical diameter.\r\nFour characteristic stages of the experiment are shown in Figs. 52 to\r\n55, Plate XII. Fig. 52 exhibits the appearance just after commencing the\r\nexperiment, the optic axes being well in the field of view. Fig. 53\r\nshows the axes horizontally approaching the centre. Fig. 54 shows the\r\nactual crossing, which occurs for different crystals at temperatures\r\nvarying from 105°.5 to 111°.5 C.; and Fig. 55 represents the axes again\r\nseparated, but vertically.\r\n\r\nThe experiment as thus performed is one of the most beautiful\r\nimaginable, and it can readily be understood how delighted were\r\nMitscherlich’s audience on the occasion of its first performance by him.\r\nThe author has since discovered no less than six other cases of\r\nsubstances which exhibit crossed-axial-plane dispersion of the optic\r\naxes, in the course of his investigations, one of which is illustrated\r\nin Plate XIII., facing page 108; and, moreover, has arrived at a general\r\nexplanation of the whole phenomenon, the main points of which are that\r\nsuch substances, besides showing very feeble double refraction (the two\r\nextreme of the three refractive indices being very close together), also\r\nexhibit very close approximation of the intermediate refractive index β\r\nto either the minimum index α or the maximum index γ. Also, change of\r\ntemperature, or of wave-length, or most usually both, must so operate as\r\nto bring the two indices closest together into actual identity and then\r\nto pass beyond each other, these two indices thus exchanging positions,\r\nthe extreme one becoming the intermediate index. In other words, the\r\nuniaxial cross and circular rings are produced owing to two of the three\r\nrefractive indices (corresponding to the directions of the three\r\nrectangular axes of the ellipsoid which, in general, expresses the\r\noptical properties of a crystal) becoming equal at the particular\r\ntemperature at which the phenomenon is observed to occur, and for light\r\nof the specific wave-length in question. The ellipsoid of general form\r\nwhich represents the optical properties of a biaxial crystal thus\r\nbecomes converted into a rotation ellipsoid corresponding to a uniaxial\r\ncrystal. Brookite and the triple tartrate are excellent examples of the\r\npredominance of the effect of change of wave-length, for the optic axes\r\nare separated in both cases widely in one plane for red light and almost\r\nequally widely in the perpendicular plane for blue light. The new cases\r\nobserved by the author are sensitive both to change of wave-length and\r\nto change of temperature, and so fall midway between the cases just\r\nquoted and the case of gypsum. The cause of it, in four of these new\r\ninstances, is a very interesting one, connected with the regular change\r\nof the refractive indices in accordance with the law of progression in\r\nan isomorphous series according to the atomic weight of the alkali metal\r\npresent, which will be discussed in Chapter X.\r\n\r\nA further most important discovery was made by Mitscherlich in the year\r\n1827, which also profoundly concerns the work of the author, namely,\r\nthat of selenic acid, H_{2}SeO_{4}, analogous to sulphuric acid, and of\r\nthe large group of salts derived from it, the selenates, analogous to\r\nthe sulphates. He showed first that potassium selenate, K_{2}SeO_{4}, is\r\nisomorphous with potassium sulphate, K_{2}SO_{4}, and subsequently that\r\nthe selenates in general are isomorphous with the corresponding\r\nsulphates; consequently it followed that selenium is a member of the\r\nsulphur family of elements. This element selenium had only been\r\ndiscovered ten years previously by his friend Berzelius, and doubtless\r\nMitscherlich had seen a great deal of the work in connection with it\r\nduring the two years which he spent in the laboratory of Berzelius at\r\nStockholm, and was deeply interested in it.\r\n\r\nThe discovery has proved a most fruitful one, for the selenates are\r\nbeautifully crystalline salts, particularly suitable for\r\ncrystallographic researches, and their detailed investigation has\r\nafforded a most valuable independent confirmation of the important\r\nresults obtained for the sulphates.\r\n\r\nAgain in 1830 Mitscherlich, following up the preliminary work already\r\nreferred to, definitely established another fact bearing on the same\r\nseries, namely, the isomorphism of potassium manganate K_{2}MnO_{4} with\r\nthe sulphate and selenate of potash; moreover, on continuing his study\r\nof the manganese salts he further substantiated the isomorphism of the\r\npermanganates with the perchlorates, and isolated permanganic acid. This\r\nalso proved a most important step forward, as these salts likewise\r\nafford admirable material for crystallographic investigation, and such\r\nan examination, carried out by Muthmann and Barker, has yielded most\r\nvaluable results.\r\n\r\nMuch later in his career Mitscherlich also described the dimorphous\r\niodide of mercury, HgI_{2}, one of the most remarkable and interesting\r\nsalts known to us, the unstable yellow rhombic modification being\r\nconverted into the more stable red tetragonal form by merely touching\r\nwith a hard substance. Also we are indebted to him at the same later\r\nperiod for our knowledge of the crystalline forms of the elements\r\nphosphorus, iodine, and selenium, when crystallised from solution in\r\nbisulphide of carbon.\r\n\r\nFrom the record of achievements which has now been given in this chapter\r\nit will be obvious how much chemical crystallography owes to\r\nMitscherlich. The description of his work has taken us into almost every\r\nbranch of the subject, morphological, optical, and thermal, and although\r\nit has consequently been necessary to refer to phenomena which have not\r\nyet been explained in this book, it has doubtless proved on the whole\r\nmost advantageous thus to present the life work of this great master as\r\na complete connected story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n               MORPHOTROPY AS DISTINCT FROM ISOMORPHISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been shown in the last chapter how Mitscherlich discovered the\r\nprinciple of isomorphism, as applying to the cases of substances so\r\nclosely related that their interchangeable chemical elements are members\r\nof the same family group; and also how the principle enabled him to\r\ndetermine the chemical constitution of two hitherto unknown acids which\r\nhe isolated, selenic H_{2}SeO_{4} and permanganic HMnO_{4}. For he\r\nobserved that the selenates were isomorphous with the sulphates, and the\r\npermanganates with the perchlorates. It was further made clear that the\r\nprinciple as bequeathed to us by Mitscherlich was only defined in very\r\ngeneral terms, and its details have only recently been precisely\r\ndecided.\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further (in Chapter X.) with the elucidation of the\r\ntrue nature of isomorphism, however, some important crystallographic\r\nrelationships between substances less closely related than family\r\nanalogues must be referred to, as the outcome of a series of\r\ninvestigations by von Groth, chiefly between the derivatives of the\r\nhydrocarbon benzene. Also, some suggestive results obtained by the\r\nauthor from an investigation of an organic homologous series, that is,\r\none the members of which differ by the regular addition of a CH_{3}\r\ngroup, may be briefly referred to.\r\n\r\nThe interval between the work of Mitscherlich and that of von Groth was\r\none of doubt, discouragement, and somewhat of discredit for chemical\r\ncrystallography. The chemists Laurent[3] and Nicklès[4] carried out\r\nduring the years from 1842 to 1849 measurements of numerous organic\r\nsubstances and of some inorganic compounds, the former chiefly halogen\r\nor other derivatives of particular hydrocarbons or salts of homologous\r\nfatty acids. Laurent, for instance, found that naphthalene\r\ntetrachloride, C_{10}H_{8}.Cl_{4}, and chloronaphthalene tetrachloride,\r\nC_{10}H_{7}Cl.Cl_{4}, crystallise in different systems, the former in\r\nthe monoclinic and the latter in the rhombic system. Yet the primary\r\nprism angles of the two are less than a degree different, namely, 109°\r\n0′ and 109° 45′. Laurent named this kind of similarity “hemimorphism,” a\r\nmost unfortunate term as it was already employed in crystallography in\r\nits other well-known geometrical significance, that is, to denote a\r\ncrystal differently terminated at the two ends of an axis. Many other\r\nlike similarities were discovered by Laurent, and he again coined an\r\nobjectionable term, now discarded, to represent the cases of similarity\r\nextending over more than the same system, namely, “isomeromorphism.”\r\n\r\nNicklès observed similar facts in connection with the barium salts of\r\nthe fatty acids, which crystallise in different systems with different\r\namounts of water of crystallisation. But their prism angles are all\r\nwithin a couple of degrees of each other, varying from 98° to 100°. Thus\r\nthe phenomenon of “isogonism,” a term much less objectionable than those\r\ninvented by Laurent, appears to be a common observance not only for\r\ndifferent kinds of derivatives of the same original hydrocarbon or other\r\norganic nucleus, but also for the case of homologous series. But Nicklès\r\nmissed the real point by including salts with different amounts of\r\nwater, which, it will be shown later, entirely upset the crystalline\r\nstructure. When this is eliminated the resemblance between true\r\nsimilarly constituted homologues, differing by regular increments of\r\nCH_{3}, is very much closer than would appear from Nicklès’ results.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, some of the work of Laurent and Nicklès was not carried\r\nout with the care and accuracy which is indispensable for researches\r\nwhich are to retain permanent value, and critics were not slow to arise.\r\nKopp,[5] in 1849, unmercifully exposed these failings, so that the real\r\nkernel of the work, which was of considerable value, came into\r\ndiscredit.\r\n\r\nPasteur,[6] however, in 1848, besides the important observations\r\nregarding enantiomorphism, to be described in Chapter XI., had noticed\r\nsimilar zonal likenesses between related tartrates, amounting only\r\ntherefore to isogonism and not to isomorphism; for here again the system\r\noften differed, particularly when the members of a series compared\r\ndiffered in their water of crystallisation. Thus there was ample\r\nevidence of a really significant series of facts in the work of these\r\nauthors, but they were not properly arranged and explained.\r\n\r\nSo high was the feeling against the whole subject carried, however,\r\nafter Kopp’s memoir, that had it not been for the steadying influence of\r\nRammelsberg and Marignac, who themselves carried out many\r\ncrystallographic measurements as new substances continued to be\r\ndiscovered with great rapidity, the science would have suffered a\r\nserious set-back. Moreover, even Rammelsberg was led astray in the\r\ndirection of the views of the chemists of the time, that isomorphism\r\ncould be extended over the crystal system. Frankenheim, whose discovery\r\nof the space-lattice, to be referred to in the next chapter, will ever\r\nrender his name famous, strongly opposed this view. Delafosse, on the\r\nother hand, recognised some truth in both views, and assumed that there\r\nwere two kinds of isomorphism, that of Mitscherlich on the one hand, and\r\nthe broader one of Laurent on the other hand, and that in the case of\r\nthe latter kind the overstepping of the system is no bar.\r\n\r\nHjortdahl,[7] in the year 1865, supported the views of Delafosse more or\r\nless, at any rate so far as to assume the possibility of the existence\r\nof partial isomorphism, that is, of isogonism. He was very definite,\r\nhowever, against accepting the proposition that any general law could be\r\napplied. He himself discovered a partial similarity of angles in several\r\nhomologous series of organic compounds.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Sella[8] uttered a warning which is one worthy of being\r\nprominently posted in every research laboratory, namely, that _It is\r\nunwise to make hasty generalisations from the results of a small number\r\nof observations_. Were this principle more generally followed, much\r\ngreater progress would in the end be achieved, and without the\r\ndiscouragement and discredit which inevitably follows the detection of\r\nerrors due to lack of broad experimental foundation. It is certainly an\r\nincontrovertible fact that only such generalisations as find themselves\r\nin accordance with all new but well-verified experimental facts as they\r\nare revealed can stand the test of time and become accepted universally\r\nas true laws of nature. And it is unreasonable to expect any\r\ngeneralisation to be of such a character unless it is already based on\r\nso large a number of facts that there is little fear of other new ones\r\nupsetting them.\r\n\r\nSome order was, however, introduced into this chaotic state of chemical\r\ncrystallography in the year 1870 by P. von Groth.[9] He investigated\r\nsystematically the derivatives of the hydrocarbon benzene, C_{6}H_{6},\r\nmany of which are excellently crystallising solids suitable for\r\ngoniometrical measurement. He showed that although the crystal system\r\nmay be and often is altered, yet there is a striking similarity in the\r\nangles between the faces of certain zones, which for the purposes of\r\ncomparison he arranged to be parallel to each other in his descriptions\r\nof the crystals, so that the relationship would then consist in an\r\nelongation or a shortening of this particular zone axis, which was\r\nusually a crystallographic axis. He recognised that this was a totally\r\ndifferent phenomenon from isomorphism, and called it “morphotropy.”\r\nAlthough it may possibly be permissible from one point of view to regard\r\nisomorphism as a particular case of complete morphotropy along all\r\nzones, such a course is not advisable, as morphotropic similarities are\r\nfrequently of a comparatively loose and often indeed of a somewhat vague\r\ncharacter, while isomorphous relationships are governed by very precise\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThus von Groth showed first that benzene, C_{6}H_{6}, crystallises in\r\nthe rhombic system with axial ratios _a_ : _b_ : _c_ = 0.891 : 1 :\r\n0.977. Next, that when one or two of the hydrogen atoms are replaced by\r\nhydroxyl OH groups the substances produced, phenol C_{6}H_{5}.OH and\r\nresorcinol C_{6}H_{4}(OH)_{2}, are found also to crystallise in the\r\nrhombic system, and in the second case, for which alone the axial ratios\r\ncould be determined, the ratio _a_ : _b_ proved to be very similar, but\r\nthe ratio _c_ : _b_ was different, the actual values being _a_ : _b_ :\r\n_c_ = 0.910 : 1 : 0.540. Pyrocatechol, the isomer of resorcinol, also\r\ncrystallises in the rhombic system, but the crystals have not been\r\nobtained sufficiently well formed to enable any deductions to be made\r\nfrom any measurements carried out with them.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the nitro-derivatives of phenol, orthonitrophenol\r\nC_{6}H_{4}.OH.NO_{2}, dinitrophenol C_{6}H_{3}.OH.(NO_{2})_{2}, and\r\ntrinitrophenol C_{6}H_{2}.OH.(NO_{2})_{3}, also crystallise in the\r\nrhombic system, and with the following respective axial ratios: 0.873 :\r\n1 : 0.60; 10.933 : 1 : 0.753; 0.937 : 1 : 0.974. Again, the value for\r\nthe ratio _a_ : _b_ is not very different from that of benzene itself,\r\nwhile the ratio _c_ : _b_ differs considerably in the first two cases.\r\nSimilar relations were also found to hold good in the cases of\r\nmeta-dinitrobenzene, C_{6}H_{4}(NO_{2})_{2}, axial ratios 0.943 : 1 :\r\n0.538, and trinitrobenzene, C_{6}H_{3}(NO_{2})_{3}, which possesses the\r\naxial ratios 0.954 : 1 : 0.733.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a chlorine or bromine atom or a CH_{3} group in\r\nplace of hydrogen was found by von Groth to produce more than the above\r\neffect, the symmetry being often lowered to monoclinic, a fact which had\r\nalso been observed to occur in the cases of certain isomers of the\r\nsubstances quoted above, ortho-dinitrobenzene for instance. But it was\r\nnevertheless observed that the angles between the faces in the prism\r\nzone remained very similar, the angles between the faces of the primary\r\nprism (110) and (1̄10), for instance, only varying in eight such\r\nderivatives of all three types, whether rhombic or monoclinic, from 93°\r\n45′ to 98° 51′.\r\n\r\nThe crystallographic relationships of organic substances, however, are\r\nvery much complicated by the possibilities of isomerism, the ortho,\r\nmeta, and para compounds—corresponding to the replacement of the two\r\nhydrogen atoms attached to two adjacent, alternate, or opposite carbon\r\natoms respectively, of the six forming the benzene ring—generally\r\ndiffering extensively and sometimes completely in crystalline form.\r\nConsequently, the phenomenon of morphotropy is best considered quite\r\nindependently of isomorphism.\r\n\r\nAn interesting intermediate case between morphotropy and true\r\nisomorphism was investigated by the author in the year 1890, namely, a\r\nseries of homologous organic compounds differing by regular increments\r\nof the organic radicle CH_{3}. They were prepared by Prof. Japp and Dr\r\nKlingemann, and consisted of the methyl, CH_{3}, ethyl, C_{2}H_{5}, and\r\npropyl, C_{3}H_{7}, derivatives of the substance triphenyl pyrrholone,\r\nall of them being solids crystallising well. The problem was somewhat\r\ncomplicated by the development of polymorphism, the methyl, ethyl, and\r\npropyl compounds having each been found to be dimorphous, and not\r\nimprobably trimorphous, but only two varieties of each salt were\r\nobtained in crystals adequately perfect for measurement. That the\r\nproduction of these different forms was due to polymorphism and not to\r\nchemical isomerism (different arrangement of the chemical atoms in the\r\nmolecule) was shown by the fact that one variety could be obtained from\r\nthe other by simply altering the conditions of crystallisation from the\r\nsame solvent. Their identical chemical composition was established by\r\ndirect analysis.\r\n\r\nThe methyl (CH_{3}) compound crystallised in rhombohedra and in\r\ntriclinic prisms. The ethyl (C_{2}H_{5}) derivative was deposited in\r\ntriclinic prisms exactly resembling those of the methyl compound in\r\nhabit and disposition of faces. A crystal of the triclinic methyl\r\nderivative which would represent equally well the ethyl compound is\r\nshown in Fig. 56. The angles also of the crystals of the two substances\r\nare so similar that one might infer the existence of true and complete\r\nisomorphism. The actual angular differences rarely exceeded three\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 56.—Crystal of Methyl Triphenyl Pyrrholone.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBesides the triclinic form the ethyl derivative was also obtained in\r\nmonoclinic crystals, one of which is represented in Fig. 57. This\r\nillustration might serve equally well, however, for a corresponding\r\nmonoclinic form of the propyl (C_{3}H_{7}) derivative, and the angles of\r\nthese two monoclinic ethyl and propyl compounds are even closer than\r\nthose of the triclinic methyl and ethyl derivatives, the closeness\r\nincreasing with the advent of symmetry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 57.—Crystal of Ethyl Triphenyl Pyrrholone.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis similarity of angles in the cases of the two pairs of triclinic and\r\nmonoclinic compounds is not only true about particular zones, but about\r\nall the zones, so that it is a case isomorphism rather than of isogonism\r\n(morphotropy). The similarity of optical properties is also very close,\r\nand so much so in the cases of the monoclinic crystals of ethyl and\r\npropyl triphenyl pyrrholone that both exhibit very high dispersion of\r\nthe optic axes. In the case of the propyl derivative the difference\r\nbetween the apparent angle of the optic axes for red lithium light and\r\nfor green thallium light amounts to 11°. In the case of the ethyl\r\ncompound this difference is enhanced so considerably that the crystals\r\nafford a remarkable instance of dispersion of the optic axes in crossed\r\naxial planes, resembling the case of gypsum discovered by Mitscherlich\r\nand described in the last chapter, except that the sensitiveness is to\r\nchange of wave-length in the illuminating light rather than to change of\r\ntemperature. The optic axial plane is perpendicular to the symmetry\r\nplane for lithium and sodium light, as it is also in the case of the\r\npropyl compound; but in the ethyl derivative it crosses over for\r\nthallium light and rays beyond that towards the violet, into a plane at\r\nright angles to the former plane, namely, the symmetry plane itself. The\r\ntotal dispersion between the two axes as separated in the one plane for\r\nred light, and as separated in the other perpendicular plane for blue\r\nlight, is more than 70°. Fig. 58, Plate XIII., shows the nature of the\r\ninterference figures afforded in convergent polarised light of different\r\nwave-lengths by a section-plate perpendicular to the first median line.\r\nThe figure at _f_ represents what is observed in white light, as far as\r\nis possible by a drawing in black and white. It consists of a series of\r\nconcave coloured curves, falling in between the arms of the cross, and\r\nlooping round the axes, a figure very much like that afforded by\r\nbrookite and triple tartrate of ammonium, potassium, and sodium, the\r\nsubstances already mentioned in Chapter VII. as being similarly very\r\nsensitive to change of wave-length. The figure in red monochromatic\r\nlithium light is shown at _a_ in Fig. 58, and that for yellow sodium\r\nlight at _b_, the axes being now much closer together. On changing to\r\ngreen thallium light the line joining the optic axes becomes vertical\r\ninstead of horizontal, as shown at _d_.\r\n\r\nWhen, instead of employing monochromatic flames, the spectroscopic\r\nmonochromatic illuminator (Fig. 75, page 193), described by the author\r\nsome years ago to the Royal Society, is employed to illuminate the\r\npolariscope, the source of light being the electric arc, the change of\r\nthe figure from that given by the extreme red of the spectrum to that\r\nafforded by the violet may be beautifully followed, and the exact\r\nwave-length in the greenish yellow determined for which the crossing\r\noccurs and an apparently uniaxial figure of circular rings and\r\nrectangular cross is produced. For it is possible with the aid of this\r\nilluminator directly to observe the production of the uniaxial figure.\r\nThe wave-length is either directly afforded by the graduation of the\r\nfine-adjustment micrometric drum or is obtained from a curve of\r\nwave-lengths, constructed to correspond to the circle readings of the\r\nilluminator. The appearance of the interference figure for this critical\r\nwave-length is shown at _c_ in Fig. 58. The remaining figure at _e_\r\nrepresents the appearance when a mixture of sodium and thallium light is\r\nemployed, which clearly indicates the four extreme axial positions, and\r\nassists in elucidating the nature of the figure _f_ exhibited in white\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe second form of the propyl derivative belongs to the rhombic system,\r\nand a similar rhombic form of the ethyl compound was once obtained, but\r\nlost again on attempting to recrystallise.\r\n\r\nThese interesting relationships of the homologous methyl, ethyl, and\r\npropyl derivatives of triphenyl pyrrholone thus appear to form a\r\nconnecting link between cases of isogonism or morphotropy and of true\r\nisomorphism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XIII._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 58.—Interference Figures in Convergent Polarised Light of\r\n    different Wave-lengths afforded by the Monoclinic Variety of Ethyl\r\n    Triphenyl Pyrrholone; _a_, in Red Lithium Light; _b_, in Yellow\r\n    Sodium Light; _c_, in Greenish-Yellow Light of the Critical\r\n    Wave-length for Production of the Uniaxial Figure; _d_, in Green\r\n    Thallium Light; _e_, in mixed Sodium and Thallium Light; and _f_, in\r\n    White Light.\r\n\r\n  (Reproductions of Drawings by the author.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe are now, therefore, in a position to approach the question of true\r\nisomorphism, and as leading up to the fuller treatment of the subject in\r\nChapter X. we may conclude this chapter by referring first to one\r\nimportant investigation in which the necessity for extreme accuracy of\r\nmeasurement and perfection of material was fully appreciated. This was\r\nan admirable research carried out in the years 1887 and 1888 by H. A.\r\nMiers[10] on the red silver minerals, proustite, sulpharsenite of\r\nsilver, Ag_{3}AsS_{3}, and pyrargyrite, the analogous sulphantimonite of\r\nsilver, Ag_{3}SbS_{3}, which afforded a further indication of the\r\nexistence of real small differences of angle between the members of\r\ntruly isomorphous series. These two minerals form exceptionally\r\nbeautiful crystals belonging to the trigonal system, the hexagonal prism\r\nbeing always a prominent form, terminated by the primary and other\r\nrhombohedra, scalenohedra and various pyramidal forms, many of the\r\ncrystals being exceedingly rich in faces. When the crystals are freshly\r\nobtained from the dark recesses of the silver mine they are very\r\nlustrous and transparent, but they are gradually affected by light, like\r\nmany silver compounds, and require to be stored in the dark in order to\r\npreserve their transparency. A magnificent crystal of proustite from\r\nChili is one of the finest objects in the British Museum at South\r\nKensington, but is rarely seen on account of the necessity for\r\npreservation from light. Pyrargyrite is generally dark grey in\r\nappearance, and affords a reddish-purple “streak” (colour of the powder\r\non scratching or pulverising). Proustite, however, possesses a beautiful\r\nscarlet-vermilion colour, and affords a very bright red streak.\r\n\r\nNow these two beautiful minerals are obviously analogous compounds of\r\nthe same metal, silver, with the sulpho-acid of two elements, arsenic\r\nand antimony, belonging strictly to the same family group, the\r\nnitrogen-phosphorus group, of the periodic classification of the\r\nelements according to Mendeleéff. Consequently, they should be perfectly\r\nisomorphous. Miers has shown in a most complete manner that they are so,\r\nthat they occur in very perfect crystals of similar habit belonging to\r\nthe same class of the trigonal system, the ditrigonal polar class, both\r\nminerals being hemimorphic, that is, showing different forms at the two\r\nterminations, in accordance with the symmetry of the polar class of the\r\ntrigonal system. But the angles of the two substances were not found to\r\nbe identical, although constant for each compound within one minute of\r\narc, there being slight but very real differences, which are very well\r\ntypified by the principal angle in each case, that of the primary\r\nrhombohedron. In the case of proustite it is 72° 12′, while the\r\nrhombohedron angle of pyrargyrite is 71° 22′.\r\n\r\nThis interesting and beautiful investigation of Miers thus gave us an\r\ninkling of the truth, that small angular differences do exist between\r\nthe members of isomorphous compounds. It paved the way for, and indeed\r\npartly suggested, the author’s systematic investigation of the\r\nsulphates, selenates, and double salts of the alkali series of metals, a\r\nbrief account of the main results of which will be given in Chapter X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n     THE CRYSTAL SPACE-LATTICE AND ITS MOLECULAR UNIT CELL. THE 230\r\n            POINT-SYSTEMS OF HOMOGENEOUS CRYSTAL STRUCTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe interval between the morphotropic work described in the last chapter\r\nand the present time has been remarkable for the completion of the\r\ngeometrical and mathematical investigation, and the successful\r\nidentification, of all the possible types of homogeneous structures\r\npossessing the essential attributes of crystals. It has now been\r\ndefinitely established that there are 230 such types of homogeneous\r\nstructures possible, and the whole of them conform to the conditions of\r\nsymmetry of one or other of the thirty-two classes of crystals. This\r\nfact is now thoroughly agreed upon by all the authorities who have made\r\nthe subject their special study, and may truly be considered as\r\nfundamental.\r\n\r\nThere has long been a consensus of opinion that the crystal edifice is\r\nbuilt up of structural units which can be likened to the bricks or stone\r\nblocks of the builder, but which in the case of the crystal are so small\r\nas to be invisible even under the highest power of the microscope. The\r\nconceptions of their nature, however, have been almost as numerous as\r\nthe investigators themselves, everyone who has thought over the subject\r\nforming his own particular ideas concerning them. We have had the\r\n“Molécules intégrantes” of Haüy, the “Polyhédres” of Bravais, the\r\n“Fundamentalbereich” of Schönflies, the “Parallelohedra” of von Fedorow,\r\nand the fourteen-walled cell, the “Tetrakaidecahedron” of Lord Kelvin,\r\nand again the “Polyhedra” of Pope and Barlow. Ideas have thus been\r\nextremely fertile, and indeed almost every variety of speculation has\r\nbeen indulged in as to the shape and nature of the unit of the structure\r\nwhich can exhibit such remarkable evidences of organisation and such\r\nextraordinary optical and other physical properties as those of a\r\ncrystal.\r\n\r\nThere is one inherent difficulty, however, which renders all such\r\nspeculations more or less chimerical, until we know very much more as to\r\nthe structure of the chemical atom, and the organisation of the\r\ncorpuscles composing it. Such speculations, however, are deeply\r\ninteresting, and the difficulty alluded to accounts largely for the\r\ngreat variety of conception possible. It is this, that the matter of the\r\nmolecules, and again that of the atoms composing them, is not\r\nnecessarily, nor even probably, continuous and in contact throughout,\r\nbut that on the contrary the space which may legitimately be assigned to\r\nthe unit of the structure is partly void. How much of this unit space is\r\nmatter and how much is unoccupied, and how the one is related to the\r\nother as regards its position or distribution in space, we have yet no\r\nmeans of knowing, although there are signs that the day is not far\r\ndistant when we shall know at least something concerning it. The recent\r\nbrilliant work of Sir J. J. Thomson and his school of physicists has\r\nrendered it clear that the chemical atom is composed of cycles of\r\nelectronic corpuscles, the orbital motions of which determine its\r\nboundaries.\r\n\r\nIn this condition of our knowledge obviously the only safe course is\r\nto consider each atom of the chemical molecule as occupying a “sphere\r\nof influence,” within the limits of which the material parts of the\r\natom, the corpuscles in organised motion, are confined. The\r\n“Fundamentalbereich” of Schönflies and the “Sphere of Influence” of\r\nBarlow, are the conceptions which in all probability have the greatest\r\nvalue in the present state of our knowledge, and if we adopt the\r\nlatter we shall not be committing ourselves to anything more than the\r\nexperimental facts fully warrant.\r\n\r\nIt may be quite definitely stated, however, that there is a considerable\r\namount of experimental evidence that the unit of the space-lattice of\r\nthe crystal structure is certainly not more complex than the chemical\r\nmolecule, the idea of an aggregation of chemical molecules to form a\r\n“physical molecule” acting as a structural unit having proved to be a\r\nmisleading myth.\r\n\r\nFortunately, however, there is no necessity whatever to introduce the\r\nsubject of the actual shape of the unit, and the greatest progress has\r\nbeen effected by disregarding it altogether, and agreeing to the\r\nrepresentation of the unit by a point. This leads us at once to perceive\r\nthe importance of the brilliant work of the geometricians, who have now\r\ncompleted their theory of the homogeneous partitioning of space into\r\npoint-systems possible to crystals, the structural units of the latter\r\nbeing regarded as points. The investigations extend from those of\r\nFrankenheim in the year 1830 to the finishing touches given by Barlow in\r\n1894, and prominently standing forth as those of the greatest\r\ncontributors to the subject, besides the two investigators just\r\nmentioned, are the names of Bravais, Sohncke, Schönflies and von\r\nFedorow.\r\n\r\nBravais, perfecting the work of his predecessor Frankenheim, made us\r\nacquainted with the fourteen fundamentally important space-lattices, or\r\nsame-ways orientated arrangements of points. If we regard each chemical\r\nmolecule as represented by a point, disregarding the separate atoms of\r\nwhich it is composed, then these fourteen space-lattices represent the\r\npossible arrangements of the molecules in the crystal in all the simpler\r\ncases; three of these lattices have cubic symmetry; the tetragonal,\r\nhexagonal, trigonal, rhombic and monoclinic systems claim two\r\nspace-lattices each; while one space-lattice conforms to the lack of\r\nsymmetry of the triclinic system.\r\n\r\nThe fourteen space-lattices of Bravais thus represent the arrangement of\r\nthe chemical molecules in the crystal, and determine the systematic\r\nsymmetry. The points being taken absolutely analogously in all the\r\nmolecules, and the whole assemblage being homogeneous, that is, such\r\nthat the environment about any one spot is the same as about every\r\nother, the arrangement is obviously a same-ways orientated one, the\r\nmolecules being all arranged parallel-wise to each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 59.—Triclinic Space-Lattice.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut the fact that the structure is that of a space-lattice also causes\r\nthe crystal to obey the law of rational indices. To enable us to see how\r\nthis comes about it is only necessary to regard a space-lattice. In Fig.\r\n59 is represented the general form of space-lattice, that which\r\ncorresponds to triclinic symmetry. It is obviously built up of\r\nparallelepipeda, the edges of which are proportional to the lengths of\r\nthe three triclinic axes, and their mutual inclinations are those of the\r\nlatter. As we may take our representative point anywhere in the\r\nmolecule, so long as the position chosen is the same for all the\r\nmolecules of the assemblage, we may imagine the points occupying the\r\ncentres of the parallelepipeda instead of the corners if we choose, for\r\nthat would only be equivalent to moving the whole space-lattice slightly\r\nparallel to itself. Hence, each cell may be regarded as the habitat of\r\nthe chemical molecule.\r\n\r\nNow the faces of the crystal parallel to each two of the three sets of\r\nparallel lines forming the space-lattice will be the three pairs of\r\naxial-plane faces, and any fourth face inclined to them must be got by\r\nremoving parallelepipedal blocks in step-wise fashion, precisely like\r\nbricks, as already shown in Fig. 12 (page 28) in Chapter III., in order\r\nto illustrate the step by step removal of Haüy’s unit blocks. It will\r\nreadily be seen that if one more cell be removed from each row than from\r\nthe row below it, the line of contact touching the projecting corner of\r\nthe last block of each row will be inclined more steeply than if two\r\nmore cells were removed from each row. Moreover, the angle varies\r\nconsiderably between the two cases, and if three blocks are removed at a\r\ntime the angle gets very small indeed. Hence, there cannot be many such\r\nplanes possible, and we see at once why the indices of the faces\r\ndeveloped on a crystal are composed of low whole numbers and why the\r\nforms are so relatively few in number. Owing to the minuteness of a\r\nchemical molecule, all the irregularities of such a surface are\r\nsubmicroscopic, and the general effect to the eye is that of a smooth\r\nplane surface.\r\n\r\nThe space-lattice arrangement of the molecules in the crystal structure\r\nthus causes the crystal to follow the law of rational indices, by\r\nlimiting and restricting the number of possible facial forms which can\r\nbe developed. It also determines which one of the seven systems of\r\nsymmetry or styles of crystal architecture the crystal shall adopt. It\r\ndoes not determine the details of the architecture, however, that is, to\r\nwhich of the thirty-two classes it shall conform, this not being the\r\nfunction of the molecular arrangement but of the atomic arrangement that\r\nis, of the arrangement of the cluster of atoms which form the molecule,\r\nand this leads us to the next step in the unravelling of the internal\r\nstructure of crystals.\r\n\r\nThe credit of this next stage of further progress is due to Sohncke,\r\nwhose long labours resulted in the discrimination and description of\r\nsixty-five “Regular Point-Systems,” homogeneous assemblages of points\r\nsymmetrically and identically arranged about axes of symmetry, which are\r\nsometimes screw axes, that is, axes about which the points are spirally\r\ndistributed. Sohncke’s point-systems express the number of ways in which\r\nsymmetrical repetition can occur. Moreover, the points may always be\r\ngrouped in sets or clusters, the centres of gravity of which form a\r\nBravais space-lattice.\r\n\r\nThis latter fact is of great interest, for it means that Sohncke’s\r\npoints may represent the chemical atoms, and that the stereometric\r\narrangement of the atoms in the molecule is that which produces the\r\npoint-system and determines the crystal class, while the whole cluster\r\nof atoms forming the molecule furnishes, as above stated, the\r\nrepresentative point of the space-lattice.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is not the whole story, for the sixty-five Sohnckian\r\nregular point-systems only account for twenty-one of the thirty-two\r\ncrystal classes, the remaining eleven being those of lower than full\r\nholohedral systematic symmetry, and which are characterised by showing\r\ncomplementary right and left-handed forms. In other words, they exhibit\r\ntwo varieties, on one of which faces of low symmetry are developed on\r\nthe right, while on the other symmetrically complementary faces are\r\ndeveloped on the left; that is, these little faces modify on the right\r\nand left respectively the solid angles formed by those faces of the\r\ncrystal which are common to both the holohedral class of the system and\r\nto the lower symmetry class in question. In some cases, moreover, these\r\ntwo complementary forms are known to exist alone, without the presence\r\nof faces common to both the holohedral class and the class of lower\r\nsymmetry. The two varieties of the crystals are the mirror images of\r\neach other, being related as a right-hand glove is to a left-hand one.\r\n\r\nFurther, the crystals of these eleven classes very frequently exhibit\r\nthe power of rotating the plane of polarised light to the right or to\r\nthe left, and complementarily in the cases of the two varieties of any\r\none substance, corresponding to the complementariness of the two crystal\r\nforms. The converse is even more absolute, for no optically active\r\ncrystal has yet been discovered which does not belong to one or other of\r\nthese eleven classes of lower than holohedral symmetry.\r\n\r\nThe final step of accounting for the structure of these highly\r\ninteresting eleven classes of crystals was taken simultaneously by a\r\nGerman, Schönflies, a Russian, von Fedorow, and an Englishman, Barlow,\r\nwho quite independently and by totally different lines of reasoning and\r\nof geometrical illustration showed that they were entirely accounted for\r\nby the introduction of a new element of symmetry, that of mirror-image\r\nrepetition, or “enantiomorphous similarity” as distinguished from\r\n“identical similarity.” These three investigators all united in finally\r\nconcluding that when the definition of symmetrical repetition is thus\r\nbroadened to include enantiomorphous similarity, 165 further\r\npoint-systems are admitted, and the whole 230 point-systems then account\r\nfor the whole of the thirty-two classes of crystals.\r\n\r\nSchönflies’ simple definition of the nature of the structure is that\r\nevery molecule is surrounded by the rest collectively in like manner,\r\nwhen likeness may be either identity or mirror-image resemblance. Von\r\nFedorow finds the extra 165 types to be comprised in “double systems”\r\nconsisting of two “analogous systems” which are the mirror images of\r\neach other. Barlow proceeds to find in how many ways the two\r\nmirror-image forms can be combined together, there being in general\r\nthree distinct modes of duplication, including the insertion of one\r\ninside the other. He also shows that all homologous points in a\r\nstructure of the type of one of these additional 165 point-systems\r\ntogether form one of the 65 Sohnckian point-systems, the structure being\r\ncapable of the same rotations or translations, technically known as\r\n“coincidence movements” (movements which bring the structure to exhibit\r\nthe same appearance as at first), as those which are characteristic of\r\nthat point-system.\r\n\r\nThis fascinating subject of mirror-image symmetry, and the optical\r\nactivity connected with it, will be reverted to and the latter explained\r\nin Chapter XI.\r\n\r\nWe have thus seen how satisfactorily the geometrical theory of the\r\nhomogeneous partitioning of space has been worked out, and how admirably\r\nit agrees with our preliminary supposition that a crystal is a\r\nhomogeneous structure. The fact that the 230 homogeneous point-systems\r\nall fall into and distribute themselves among the thirty-two classes of\r\ncrystals, the symmetry of which has also now been fully established,\r\naffords undeniable proof that as regards this branch of the subject\r\nsomething like finality and clearness of vision has now been arrived at.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\nLAW OF VARIATION OF ANGLES IN ISOMORPHOUS SERIES. RELATIVE DIMENSIONS OF\r\n                UNIT CELLS. FIXITY OF ATOMS IN CRYSTAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to approach the conclusion of the long\r\ncontroversy as to the constancy or otherwise of crystal angles in\r\nthe cases of greatest similarity, those of isomorphous substances,\r\nand to appreciate how the conflicting views of Haüy and Mitscherlich\r\nand their schools of thought have at length been reconciled. As the\r\nresult of a comprehensive study, on the part of the author, of the\r\nsulphates and selenates of the rhombic series R_{2}S/SeO_{4}, and of\r\nthe double sulphates and selenates of the monoclinic series\r\nR_{2}M(S/SeO_{4})_{2}.6H_{2}O, in which R represents the alkali\r\nmetals, potassium, rubidium and cæsium, and in which M may be\r\nmagnesium, zinc, iron, nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper or cadmium,\r\nfour facts of prime significance have been definitely established.\r\n\r\n(1) The crystals of the different members of an isomorphous series\r\nexhibit slight but real differences in their interfacial angles, the\r\nmagnitude of the angle changing regularly with the alteration of the\r\natomic weight of the interchangeable metals or negative elements of the\r\nsame family group which give rise to the series, as one metal or\r\nacid-forming element is replaced by another. The amount of the\r\ndifference increases as the symmetry of the system diminishes. Thus the\r\nmaximum difference for the more symmetrical rhombic series of sulphates\r\nand selenates is 56′, which occurs in the case of one angle between\r\npotassium and cæsium selenates, and it is usually much less than this;\r\nin the case of the less symmetrical monoclinic series of double salts\r\nthe maximum angular difference observed was 2° 21′, between potassium\r\nand cæsium magnesium sulphates.\r\n\r\n(2) The physical properties of the crystals, such as their optical and\r\nthermal constants, are also functions of the atomic weights of the\r\nelements of the same family group which by their interchange produce the\r\nseries.\r\n\r\n(3) The dimensions of the elementary parallelepipedon of the\r\nspace-lattice, or in other words, the separation of the molecular\r\ncentres of gravity, the points or nodes of the space-lattice, along the\r\nthree directions of the crystal axes, also vary with the atomic weight\r\nof the interchangeable elements.\r\n\r\n(4) Specific chemical replacements are accompanied by clearly defined\r\nchanges in the crystal structure along equally specific directions.\r\nThus, when the metal, say potassium, in an alkali sulphate or selenate\r\nis replaced by another of the same alkali-family group, rubidium or\r\ncæsium, there is a marked alteration in the crystal angles and in the\r\ndimensions of the space-lattice, corresponding to elongation of the\r\nvertical axis; and when the acid-forming element sulphur is replaced by\r\nselenium, its family analogue, a similar very definite change occurs,\r\nbut the expansion in this case takes place in the horizontal plane of\r\nthe crystals.\r\n\r\nConfirmatory results have also been obtained as regards the\r\nmorphological constants, the investigations not extending to the optical\r\nor thermal properties, by Muthmann for the permanganates, and by Barker\r\nfor the perchlorates, of the alkali metals. Hence, there can be no doubt\r\nwhatever that, as regards the various series investigated, which are\r\nsuch as would be expected to afford the most definite results owing to\r\nthe electro-positive nature of metals being at its maximum strength in\r\nthe alkali group, the above rules are definite laws of nature.\r\n\r\nThus it is clear that in the cases of isomorphous substances, which were\r\nthe only possible exceptions to the generalisation that _to every\r\nchemically distinct solid substance of other than perfect cubic symmetry\r\nthere appertains a specific crystalline form, endowed with its own\r\nparticular angles and morphological crystal elements, which are\r\nabsolutely constant for the same temperature_, the law does really hold,\r\nand isomorphous substances are no exceptions. The law of progression of\r\nthe crystal properties according to the atomic weight of the\r\ninterchangeable elements affords indeed at the same time both an\r\namplification of the generalisation and a precise explanation of its\r\nmode of operation in these cases.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the local effect produced by the two kinds, positive\r\nand negative, of chemical replacement, has a profound bearing on crystal\r\nstructure. For it is thereby rendered certain that the atoms are fixed\r\nin the crystal edifice, and therefore in the molecule in the solid\r\nstate. It becomes obvious that the atoms—in their stereometric positions\r\nin the molecule, being thus fixed in the solid crystal when the\r\nmolecules set themselves rigidly in the regular organisation of the\r\nspace-lattice—form the points of the regular point-system of the crystal\r\nstructure, which determines to which of the thirty-two classes of\r\nsymmetry the crystal shall belong. Any movement of the atoms in the\r\ncrystal, other than that which accompanies change of temperature, and\r\npossibly change of pressure, is thus improbable; and this experimental\r\nproof of their fixity, afforded by the fact that definitely orientated\r\nchanges accompany the replacement of particular atoms, also doubtless\r\nindicates that the latter are located in the particular directions along\r\nwhich the changes of exterior angle and of internal structural\r\ndimensions are observed to occur. Stereo-chemistry, which has made such\r\nenormous advances during the last few years, thus becomes of even\r\ngreater importance than Wislicenus and its other originators ever dreamt\r\nof.\r\n\r\nWithin the atoms in the crystal the constituent electronic corpuscles\r\nmay be and probably are in rapid movement, and such physical effects as\r\nhave hitherto been ascribed to movement of the atoms within the crystal\r\nare doubtless due to movement of the electronic corpuscles within them,\r\nthe sphere of influence of the atom itself being fixed in space in the\r\nsolid crystal, and being doubtless defined by the area within which the\r\ncorpuscular movements occur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 60.—Diagram illustrating Progressive Change of Crystal Angles in\r\n    Isomorphous Series.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThree illustrations of the law of change of the crystal properties with\r\nvariation of the atomic weight of the determinative elements of an\r\nisomorphous series may be given, and will serve to render the practical\r\nmeaning of the generalisation clearer. The first is a diagrammatic\r\nrepresentation, in Fig. 60 (in a very exaggerated manner as the real\r\nchange would be inappreciable on the scale drawn), of the change of\r\nangle on replacing the potassium in potassium sulphate, K_{2}SO_{4}, or\r\nselenate, K_{2}SeO_{4}, by rubidium or cæsium. The inner crystal\r\noutline, a vertical section, is that of the potassium salt. The vertical\r\nlines represent the intersections of the two faces of the brachypinakoid\r\n_b_ = {010} with a vertical plane parallel to the macropinakoid _a_ =\r\n{100}; the horizontal lines represent the intersection of the two faces\r\nof the basal plane _c_ = {001} with the same vertical plane; and the\r\noblique lines represent the intersection of the vertical plane with the\r\nfour faces of the dome form _q_ = {011}, which are inclined to both _b_\r\nand _c_ planes. The diagram is thus designed to show the variation of\r\nthe inclination of these latter dome faces to the two rectangular axial\r\nplane faces _b_ and _c_. The outer crystal outline represents a similar\r\nsection of a crystal of the corresponding cæsium salt, and the middle\r\noutline that of a crystal of the rubidium salt.\r\n\r\nThe progressive alteration of the angle of the q-face will be obvious,\r\nthe direction of the change being correct, but the amount of change, as\r\nalready stated, being much exaggerated; in reality it never reaches a\r\ndegree between the two extreme (potassium and cæsium) salts. It will be\r\nremembered that the respective atomic weights of potassium, rubidium,\r\nand cæsium are 38·85, 84·9 and 131·9, when hydrogen equals 1, that of\r\nrubidium being almost exactly the mean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 61.—Diagram illustrating Progressive Change of Double Retraction\r\n    in Isomorphous Series.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe second illustration is taken from the optical properties. Fig. 61\r\nrepresents graphically the regular diminution of double refraction (the\r\ndifference between the two extreme indices of refraction α and γ) which\r\naccompanies increase of the atomic weight of the metal present. The\r\ndiagram exhibits the closing up of the two spectra afforded by three\r\nanalogously orientated 60°-prisms, one of each of the three salts, such\r\nas was used in determining two of the refractive indices of the salt.\r\nEach prism produces two refracted rays from the single ray furnished by\r\nthe collimator of the spectrometer, and consequently two images of the\r\nsignal-slit of the collimator when monochromatic light is used, or two\r\nspectra if white light be employed. The Websky signal-slit is narrow at\r\nthe centre to enable an accurate allocation to the vertical cross-wire\r\nof the telescope to be made, but wide at its top and bottom ends, in\r\norder to transmit ample light, and Fig. 61 shows four images of this\r\nsignal produced by each prism, namely, one R in red C-hydrogen light and\r\nanother B in greenish-blue F-hydrogen light belonging to each of the two\r\nspectra, in order to locate the two ends of each of the latter, coloured\r\nmonochromatic light of each of the two colours in turn and of the exact\r\nC and F wave-lengths having been fed to the spectrometer from the\r\nspectroscopic illuminator. It will be observed in the case of the top\r\nrow that the two spectra, each indicated by the adjacent red and\r\ngreenish-blue images, are well apart, the relative distance being about\r\nthat actually observed in the case of potassium sulphate. They are\r\nnearer together, however, in the second row, which indicates what is\r\nobserved in the case of the analogous rubidium salt, and in the lowest\r\nrow representing the relative distances of the two spectra apart in the\r\ncase of the cæsium salt, they are so close together as to overlap; for\r\nin this latter case the greenish-blue image of the left-hand spectrum,\r\ncorresponding to the a index of refraction, occupies the same position\r\nas the image for yellow sodium light of the right-hand spectrum\r\ncorresponding to γ would occupy in the case of cæsium sulphate, the a\r\nrefractive index for F-light being 1·5660 and the γ index for Na-light\r\nbeing 1·5662. The progression of the alteration of the amount of the\r\ndouble refraction is thus very striking, as the atomic weight of the\r\nmetal is varied.\r\n\r\nThe third illustration of the law of progression with atomic weight is\r\nalso an optical one, and is taken from the monoclinic series of double\r\nsulphates and selenates. It indicates the rotation, with increase of the\r\natomic weight of the metal, of the ellipsoid which graphically\r\nrepresents the optical properties, about the unique axis of symmetry,\r\nwhich is likewise an axis of optical symmetry, of the crystal. In the\r\npotassium salt the ellipsoid occupies the position indicated by the\r\nellipse drawn in continuous line in Fig. 62, the section of the\r\nellipsoid by the symmetry plane; the outline of a tabular crystal\r\nparallel to the symmetry plane is also given, as well as the axes of the\r\ncrystal and of the ellipsoid lying in that plane.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 62.—Diagram illustrating Progressive Rotation of Optical\r\n    Ellipsoid in Monoclinic Isomorphous Series.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn the rubidium salt the ellipsoid has rotated over to the left, as\r\nindicated by the dotted ellipse, for a few degrees, the number of which\r\nvaries slightly for the different groups of double salts; while in the\r\ncæsium salt it has swung over much more still, to the place marked by\r\nthe ellipse drawn in broken line. In both this and the last illustration\r\nit will be remarked that the optical change is greater between the\r\nrubidium and cæsium salts than it is between the potassium and rubidium\r\nsalts, the reason being that the optical properties are usually\r\nfunctions (of the atomic weight of the interchangeable elements) which\r\nare of an order higher than the first corresponding to simple\r\nproportionality.\r\n\r\nThese three ocular illustrations may serve to render this interesting\r\nlaw of progression, according to the atomic weight of the\r\ninterchangeable elements which give rise to the isomorphous series,\r\nclearer to the mind, by placing before it concrete instances of the\r\noperation of the law.\r\n\r\nThe generalisation itself may be very concisely expressed in the\r\nstatement that:\r\n\r\n_The whole of the properties, morphological and physical, of the\r\ncrystals of an isomorphous series of salts are functions of the atomic\r\nweights of the interchangeable chemical elements of the same family\r\ngroup which give rise to the series._\r\n\r\nThe fact that this law extends to the structural dimensions, equally\r\nwith all other morphological properties, as stated under (3) at the\r\nbeginning of this chapter, is of especial interest. For it has actually\r\nbeen found possible to determine the relations of the dimensions of the\r\nunit parallelepipeda of the space-lattices of the various salts, that\r\nis, the separation of the molecular points of the space-lattice in the\r\ndirections of the three crystal axes, for the various salts of the\r\nisomorphous series. This is achieved by combining in suitable formulæ\r\nthe volume of the unit cell of the space-lattice with the relative\r\nlengths of the three crystal axes, _a_, _b_, _c_.\r\n\r\nThe axial ratios _a_ : _b_ : _c_ are calculated from the measurements of\r\nthe crystal angles, as explained in Chapter VI., page 68, and the volume\r\nis the physical constant long known as “molecular volume,” but now for\r\nthe first time understood as regards its meaning in the case of solid\r\nsubstances. It is the quotient of the chemical constant molecular weight\r\n(the sum of the atomic weights, taking into account the number of atoms\r\nof each element present) by the specific gravity of the substance, here\r\nthe solid crystal. Very great care has been taken to obtain absolutely\r\naccurate determinations of the specific gravities of the salts, as much\r\ndepends on this now very valuable physical constant, and all the values\r\nobtained were reduced to the constant reference temperature of 20°, as\r\nthe density notoriously alters rapidly with change of temperature.\r\n\r\nWe have thus arrived at morphological constants of very considerable\r\nimportance, which are best termed “_Molecular Distance Ratios_,” as they\r\nexpress the relative distances apart in the three directions of space of\r\nthe centres of gravity or other representative points of contiguous\r\nchemical molecules. They are dependent on three experimental\r\ndeterminations, atomic weight, specific gravity, and crystal angles, all\r\nof which have now been brought to the highest pitch of refinement and\r\naccuracy; hence the molecular distance ratios are particularly\r\ntrustworthy constants. If it were only known how much is matter and how\r\nmuch is space in the molecular parallelepipedal cell, we should actually\r\nhave in these constants a relative measure of the sizes of the\r\nmolecules. They do give us, however, the relative directional dimensions\r\nof the molecular unit parallelepipedal cells of the space-lattices of\r\nthe various members of the isomorphous series, just as the molecular\r\nvolumes give us the relative volumes of these cells. For in an\r\nisomorphous series we are absolutely sure that the plan on which the\r\nspace-lattice is constructed, its style of architecture, is identical\r\nfor all the members of the isomorphous series. Hence, the molecular\r\ndistance ratios are in these cases absolutely valid and strictly\r\ncomparable. The ratios are generally expressed by the Greek letters χ :\r\nψ : ω.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the molecular distance ratios for a potassium, a rubidium,\r\nand a cæsium salt of any of the series of sulphates, selenates,\r\npermanganates, perchlorates, double sulphates or double selenates\r\ninvestigated, we invariably find that the values of χ, ψ, and ω for the\r\nrubidium salt (rubidium having the intermediate atomic weight) lie\r\nbetween the analogous sets of three values for the potassium and cæsium\r\nsalts respectively, in complete accordance with the law.\r\n\r\nFor the generalisation to apply absolutely it is essential that the\r\ninterchangeable elements shall belong strictly to the same family group\r\nof the periodic classification of Mendeleéff. Potassium, rubidium, and\r\ncæsium fulfil this condition absolutely, and so the law of progression\r\nof the crystal properties with the atomic weight of the interchangeable\r\nelements applies rigidly to their salts. Now there are two bases, the\r\nmetal thallium and the complex radicle group ammonium NH_{4}, which are\r\nnot thus related to the group of three alkali metals just mentioned, but\r\nwhich are yet capable of replacing those metals isomorphously in their\r\ncrystals without more change of angle or of structural constants than is\r\nprovoked by the replacement of potassium by cæsium; and often indeed the\r\namount of change has been singularly like the lesser amount observed\r\nwhen rubidium has been interchanged for potassium. But although this is\r\nso, the directions of the changes are irregular, being sometimes the\r\nsame as when rubidium or cæsium is introduced, and sometimes\r\ncontrariwise, and in the case of thallium there are also striking\r\noptical differences, the thallium salts being exceptionally highly\r\nrefractive. Still, morphologically the ammonium and thallium salts may\r\nlegitimately be included in the same isomorphous series with the salts\r\nof potassium, rubidium, and cæsium, and a somewhat wider interpretation\r\nhas to be given to the term “isomorphism” in order to admit these cases.\r\nTo distinguish the inner group formed by family analogues, that is, the\r\nmore exclusive group obeying the law of progression according to the\r\natomic weight, the term “eutropic” is employed.\r\n\r\nThus the “isomorphous series” of rhombic sulphates, selenates,\r\npermanganates, and perchlorates, and the monoclinic series of double\r\nsulphates and double selenates, comprise the potassium, rubidium,\r\ncæsium, thallium and ammonium salts and double salts of sulphuric,\r\nselenic, permanganic, and perchloric acids, while the inner more\r\nexclusive “eutropic series,” following the law absolutely, comprises in\r\neach case only the salts containing the family analogues, potassium,\r\nrubidium, and cæsium.\r\n\r\nIn this beautiful manner has the controversy between the schools of Haüy\r\nand Mitscherlich now been settled, the interesting law described in this\r\nchapter having definitely laid down the true nature and limitations of\r\nisomorphism, while at the same time absolutely proving as a law of\r\nnature the constancy and specific character of the crystal angles of\r\nevery definitely chemically constituted substance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n       THE EXPLANATION OF POLYMORPHISM, AND THE RELATION BETWEEN\r\n                 ENANTIOMORPHISM AND OPTICAL ACTIVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polymorphism._ It has been shown in Chapter VII. that Mitscherlich had\r\nin several instances proved the possibility of the occurrence of the\r\nsame substance in two different forms, notably sodium dihydrogen\r\nphosphate NaH_{2}PO_{4}.H_{2}O, calcium carbonate CaCO_{3} (as calcite\r\nand aragonite), the metallic sulphates known as vitriols, and the\r\nchemical element sulphur, and that he gave to the phenomenon the name\r\n“dimorphism.” Since that time large numbers of dimorphous substances\r\nhave been discovered, and several which occur in three forms and even a\r\nfew in no less than four totally distinct forms. Until the establishment\r\nof the geometrical theory of crystal structure, as expounded in Chapter\r\nIX., this phenomenon of polymorphism gave rise to endless fruitless\r\ndiscussion. It was most generally attributed to the different nature of\r\nthe so-called “physical molecule,” which was supposed to be an aggregate\r\nof chemical molecules and the unit of the space-lattice determining the\r\ncrystal system; the different polymorphous varieties were supposed to be\r\nbuilt up of structural units or physical molecules consisting of an\r\naggregation of a different number of chemical molecules. Several\r\nattempts were made by various investigators, notably by Muthmann and by\r\nFock, to determine the number of chemical molecules constituting the\r\nphysical molecule.\r\n\r\nAll these efforts, however, ended unsatisfactorily, and in the year 1896\r\nthe author showed, in a memoir[11] on “The Nature of the Structural\r\nUnit,” that in general the physical molecule is a myth, and that the\r\nchemical molecule is the only structural unit possessing the full\r\nchemical composition of the substance in question; and that its centre\r\nof gravity, or better, any representative point within it, such as a\r\nparticular atom, is the unit point of the Bravais space-lattice of the\r\ncrystal structure, while the atoms of which the chemical molecule are\r\ncomposed, arranged stereometrically identically similarly in all the\r\nmolecules, are the points of the individual point-systems which make up\r\nthe combined point-system. This does not imply a necessarily parallel\r\nand identically orientated arrangement of all the molecules, as at first\r\npostulated by Sohncke and which is a fact for his sixty-five\r\npoint-systems; for in accordance with the conclusions of Schönflies, von\r\nFedorow, and Barlow discussed in Chapter IX., cases are possible in\r\nwhich alternate molecules may be arranged as each other’s mirror images.\r\nSuch are the cases of external molecular compensation or molecular\r\ncombination, two oppositely enantiomorphous sets of molecules balancing\r\neach other within the structure, but by exterior compensation as regards\r\nthe molecule itself. Moreover, the principle of mirror-image symmetry\r\nenters, as stated in Chapter IX, altogether into the constitution of no\r\nless than 165 of the 230 types of homogeneous structure possible to\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\nHence the conception of a physical molecule is totally unnecessary and,\r\nmoreover, erroneous. The alkali sulphates and selenates exhibit\r\ndimorphism, one member of the series, ammonium selenate, having only\r\nhitherto been observed in the pure state in the second, monoclinic,\r\nform, and never in the ordinary rhombic form; and the author has\r\nconclusively proved for these salts, and also for the double salts which\r\nthey form with the sulphates and selenates of magnesium, zinc, iron,\r\nnickel, cobalt, manganese, copper, and cadmium, that the chemical\r\nmolecule is the only kind of molecule present, and that its\r\nrepresentative points are, as just stated, the nodes of the Bravais\r\nspace-lattice of the crystal structure, determining both the system of\r\nthe crystal and its obedience to the law of rational indices.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of polymorphism thus proves, in the light of the results\r\nwhich have now been laid before the reader, to be a remarkably simple\r\none. Special pains were taken in explaining those results to show that\r\nthe temperature had a great deal to do with the conditions of\r\nequilibrium of the crystal structure, for it determines the\r\nintermolecular distances, that is, the amount of separation of the\r\nmolecules, and thus controls their possibility of movement with respect\r\nto one another. Now the behaviour of the chemical molecules on the\r\nadvent of crystallisation is undoubtedly largely influenced by the\r\nstereometric arrangement of the atoms composing them, and it is possible\r\nfor the latter to be such that the molecules may take up several\r\ndifferent parallel or enantiomorphously related positions; or as we have\r\njust seen, a regular alternation within the crystal structure of such\r\nmirror-image positions may be taken up. These different arrangements,\r\nwhether parallel or enantiomorphously opposite, may be, and probably\r\nwill be, of different degrees of stability, each of these different\r\nforms finding its maximum stability of equilibrium at some particular\r\ntemperature, which is different for the different varieties. Hence, at a\r\nseries of ascending or descending temperatures, assuming the pressure to\r\nremain the ordinary atmospheric, these different types of homogeneous\r\ncrystal structures will be most liable to be produced, each at its own\r\nparticular temperature, for which stable equilibrium of that crystal\r\nstructure occurs.\r\n\r\nThese different assemblages are as a rule quite dissimilar, certainly in\r\nthe crystal elements, often in class and not infrequently in system.\r\nGenerally two such different crystalline forms are all that are possible\r\nwithin the life-range of temperature of the substance. But occasionally\r\nthree or even as many as four such different forms are found to be\r\ncapable of existence within the temperature life-limits of the\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nPolymorphism is thus completely and simply explained as a direct result\r\nof the establishment of the geometrical theory of crystal structure as\r\nlaid down in Chapter IX. The equilibrium of the homogeneous structure is\r\na function of the temperature, and the stereometric arrangement of the\r\natoms in the chemical molecule of a substance may be such as permits of\r\ntwo or more homogeneous arrangements of the molecules in assemblages of\r\nvarying degrees of stability, but each of which has a maximum stability\r\nat a particular temperature. Hence, within any given range of\r\ntemperature such a substance will assume that type of homogeneous\r\narrangement of its molecules in a crystal which corresponds to the\r\nstablest equilibrium within these temperature limits, assuming the\r\npressure constant within the bounds of the usual atmospheric variations.\r\nEmploying the language of physical chemistry, such a substance will thus\r\npresent two or more different solid “phases,” each characterised by its\r\nspecific crystalline form, the elementary parallelepipedon of which is\r\nquite a distinct one. Each phase possesses also its own specific optical\r\nand other physical properties, such as melting point, solubility,\r\nthermal expansion, and elasticity.\r\n\r\nIt would appear as if the element sulphur is also polymorphous in this\r\nsense, for the monoclinic prismatic form (Fig. 2, Plate I.)—the best\r\nknown and most easily prepared, from the state of fusion, of all the\r\nforms other than the common rhombic form, in which sulphur is found in\r\nthe neighbourhood of volcanoes and in which it is also deposited from\r\nsolution in carbon bisulphide—is of distinctly lower stability, the\r\ncrystals passing in a few days into powder composed of minute crystals\r\nof the stable rhombic variety. But in the case of carbon, with its\r\ntotally different and apparently at ordinary temperatures equally stable\r\nvarieties of octahedral-cubic diamond (Fig. 82, Plate XVI.) and\r\nhexagonal graphite, there is some doubt; for although the diamond is\r\nconverted into graphite at a red heat in the electric arc, it is\r\ndoubtful whether we are not in the presence of a case of chemical\r\npolymerism or allotropy, like the case of ozone, where three atoms of\r\noxygen compose the molecule, instead of the two atoms in the molecule of\r\nordinary oxygen. The fact that the negatively electrified electronic\r\ncorpuscles of the Crookes tube cause the same conversion of diamond into\r\ngraphite, producing according to Parsons and Swinton a temperature of\r\n4,890° C. in the act, is evidence in favour of allotropy, as the charged\r\ncorpuscles are a very likely agent for breaking down such atomic\r\ncombinations. Moreover, diamond is volatilised out of contact with air\r\nat 3,600° C. without liquefaction, and the vapour when cold condenses as\r\ngraphite. But there is reason to believe, from experiments by Sir Andrew\r\nNoble and Sir William Crookes, that under great pressure carbon does\r\nliquefy at 3,600° C., and that the liquid drops on cooling crystallise\r\nas diamond.\r\n\r\nThe yellow and red varieties of phosphorus may also be due to a similar\r\ncause, the yellow variety, which forms excellent crystals, corresponding\r\nto P_{4}, while the red variety may correspond to a molecule composed of\r\na different number of atoms than four.\r\n\r\nAnother view of the nature of polymorphism has lately been brought\r\nforward by Lehmann, as the result of his remarkable experimental\r\ndiscovery of “liquid crystals,” to which fuller reference will be made\r\nin Chapter XVI. This new view is, however, but an amplification of the\r\nforegoing explanation of polymorphism, indicating the possible mode in\r\nwhich the stereometric position of the atoms in the molecule does\r\nactually influence and even determine the particular homogeneous\r\nstructure which shall be erected, and explains why the temperature plays\r\nsuch an important rôle. Lehmann’s theory is that any one definitely\r\nstereometrically constituted chemical molecule can only display one\r\nparticular homogeneous structure and form of crystal, and that when at a\r\nparticular temperature the system or class of symmetry is altered, this\r\noccurs because the stereometric arrangement of the atoms within the\r\nmolecule is altered, that is, a new form of molecule is produced, which\r\nnaturally gives rise to a new form of crystal. As far as the author\r\nunderstands it, this does not mean an isomeric change from the chemical\r\npoint of view, the chemical compound remaining the same, but that the\r\nstereometric positions of the atoms have been changed, without altering\r\ntheir chemical attachments, but sufficiently to change the nature of the\r\npoint-system which they produce. A significant fact in support of this\r\nview is that the molecules of the substances forming liquid crystals are\r\nusually very complicated and extended ones, comprising a large number of\r\natoms, the molecules, in fact, corresponding in length with the long\r\nnames of the organic substances of which they are generally composed.\r\n\r\nLehmann’s work has certainly proved that the molecule is endowed\r\nwith more individuality than has hitherto been ascribed to it, and\r\nhe even shows that there is some ground for believing that his\r\nliquid crystals are such because this directive orientative force\r\nresident in the molecules themselves maintains them in their\r\nmutually crystallographically orientated positions even in the\r\nliquid state, which may be and sometimes is as mobile as water. It\r\nthus appears that any general acceptance of Lehmann’s ideas will\r\nonly tend to amplify and further explain the nature of polymorphism\r\non the lines here laid down, the temperature of conversion of one\r\nform into another being merely that at which either a different\r\nhomogeneous packing is possible, or that at which the stereometric\r\nrelations of the atoms in the molecule are so altered as to produce\r\na new form of point-system without forming a new chemical compound.\r\n\r\n_Enantiomorphism of Crystalline Form and Optical Activity._ It has\r\nalready been stated that two supplementary forms which are similar but\r\nnot identical, the one being the inverse or mirror-image reflection of\r\nthe other, as a right-hand glove is to a left-hand one, are termed\r\n“enantiomorphous.” Also it has been shown that all those crystal forms\r\nwhich have no plane of symmetry, either of simple symmetry or\r\nalternating symmetry (which is equivalent to saying that no centre of\r\nsymmetry is present in addition to no plane of symmetry), are\r\nenantiomorphous, and that such forms belong to eleven specific classes.\r\nIt has further been shown that the introduction of this principle of\r\nmirror-image symmetry or enantiomorphism into the conditions already\r\nlaid down by Bravais and Sohncke for a homogeneous structure, by von\r\nFedorow, Schönflies, and Barlow, enabled those investigators to derive\r\nthe remaining 165 of the 230 possible types of homogeneous structures\r\ncompatible with crystal structure, over and above the 65 already\r\nestablished by Bravais and Sohncke, and thus to complete the geometry of\r\ncrystal structure, when the units of such structure are represented by\r\npoints. Sohncke subsequently accepted the new principle, and modified\r\nhis own theory so as to bring it into line with it. He exhibited some\r\ndisinclination, however, at first, to accept the idea—which is a part of\r\nthe assumption of the other three authors just referred to, and which\r\nappears to be absolutely necessary to explain one or two of the most\r\ncomplicated of the crystal classes—of the possibility of two\r\nenantiomorphous kinds of molecule being present in the crystal of the\r\nsame single substance, the balancing of the two sets having the effect\r\nof producing mirror-image symmetry of the whole crystal, that is, the\r\ndevelopment of a plane of symmetry.\r\n\r\nNow the whole subject is of deep interest, both physical and chemical as\r\nwell as crystallographical, inasmuch as it is precisely such substances\r\nas show enantiomorphism,—and can thus exist in two forms, one of which\r\nis the mirror-image of the other and not its identical counterpart, the\r\ntwo being like a pair of gloves,—which are found to possess the property\r\nof rotating the plane of polarised light and which are therefore said to\r\nbe “optically active.” Moreover, the property may be displayed by both\r\nthe crystals and their respective solutions, or by the crystals only.\r\nIf, therefore, two optical antipodes of the same substance are known,\r\none rotating the plane of polarisation to the right and the other\r\nrotating it to the same extent to the left, their crystals invariably\r\nexhibit mirror-image symmetry with respect to each other. The converse\r\ndoes not necessarily hold good, however, that a crystal possessing the\r\nsymmetry of one of these eleven classes will always exhibit optical\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nPasteur[12] was the first to recognise this important relation between\r\nenantiomorphous crystalline form and optical activity, in the case of\r\ntartaric acid, which has the empirical formula C_{4}H_{6}O_{6} and the\r\nconstitution:\r\n\r\n                                  COOH\r\n                                  |\r\n                                  CHOH\r\n                                  |\r\n                                  CHOH\r\n                                  |\r\n                                  COOH\r\n\r\nTartaric acid was isolated by Scheele in 1769, and its discovery was\r\ndescribed in the very first memoir of that distinguished chemist.\r\nAnother very similar acid, as regards some of its more apparent\r\nproperties, was afterwards, in 1819, described by John of Berlin, and\r\ninvestigated by Gay-Lussac in 1826; the latter obtained it from the\r\ngrape juice deposits of the wine manufactory of Kestner at Thann in the\r\nVosges. It was still more fully investigated by Gmelin in 1829, who\r\ncalled it racemic acid (Traubensäure). But it needed the genius of\r\nBerzelius to prove that it really had the same composition as tartaric\r\nacid, although so different to that acid in some of its properties.\r\n\r\nWe have here as a matter of fact, the first instance brought to light\r\ninvolving the principle of isomerism, the existence of two or more\r\ndistinct compounds having the same chemical composition as regards the\r\nnumbers of atoms of the same elements present, but differing in chemical\r\nor physical properties, or both, owing to the different arrangement of\r\nthose atoms within the molecule. The “isomers” may be chemical or purely\r\nphysical; the latter involves no alteration of the linking of the atoms,\r\nbut merely of their disposition in space, and is the kind met with in\r\nthe case of the tartaric acids.\r\n\r\nBiot, so noted for his optical researches, showed afterwards that\r\ntartaric and racemic acids behave optically differently in solution, an\r\naqueous solution of the former rotating the plane of polarisation to the\r\nright whilst that of racemic acid is optically inactive, not rotating\r\nthe plane of polarisation at all. That is, if the dark field be produced\r\nin the polariscope, by crossing the polarising and analysing Nicol\r\nprisms at right angles, tartaric acid solution will restore the light\r\nagain, and the analyser will have to be rotated to the right in order to\r\nreproduce darkness. In the case of tartaric acid, the crystals\r\nthemselves also rotate the plane of polarisation, the amount being as\r\nmuch as 11°.4 in sodium fight for a plate of the crystal one millimetre\r\nthick. On the other hand, neither the solution nor the crystals of\r\nracemic acid rotate the plane of polarisation at all.\r\n\r\nPasteur’s discovery, made in the year 1848, consisted in finding that\r\nracemic acid is really a molecular compound of two physical “isomers,”\r\nnamely, of ordinary tartaric acid, which, as we have seen, rotates the\r\nplane of polarisation to the right, and of another variety of tartaric\r\nacid which rotates the beam of polarised fight to the same extent to the\r\nleft. The latter and ordinary tartaric acid he therefore distinguished\r\nas lævo tartaric acid and dextro-tartaric acid respectively. Pasteur\r\nwent even further than this, in discovering yet a fourth variety of\r\ntartaric acid, which is optically inactive like racemic acid, but which\r\ncannot be split up into two optically active antipodes.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it has since been shown that there are three varieties of this\r\ntruly inactive tartaric acid; they are cases of isomerism of the\r\nchemical molecule itself, that is, the stereometric arrangement of the\r\natoms in the molecule is different in the three cases. For the molecule\r\nof tartaric acid—in common with the molecules of all carbon compounds\r\nthe solutions of which, or which themselves in the liquid state, rotate\r\nthe plane of polarisation—possesses an asymmetric carbon atom, an atom\r\nof carbon which is linked by its four valency attachments to four\r\ndifferent kinds of atoms or radicle groups; indeed, the molecule of\r\ntartaric acid contains two such asymmetric carbon atoms, namely, the two\r\nin the pair of CHOH groups. For each of these carbon atoms is linked by\r\none attachment to the carbon atom of the outer COOH group, by another to\r\nan atom of hydrogen, by a third to the oxygen of the group OH, and by\r\nits fourth attachment to the carbon atom of the other group CHOH, which\r\ncarries the rest of the molecule, that is, this attachment is to the\r\nother half-molecule CHOH.COOH. Hence, it is quite obvious that there can\r\nbe two different dispositions of the atoms in space, one of which would\r\nbe the mirror-image of the other, while leaving the arrangement of the\r\natoms about the two asymmetric carbon atoms dissimilar and not\r\nsymmetrical in mirror-image fashion. That is, the two dispositions would\r\nrender the molecules in the two cases enantiomorphous with respect to\r\neach other, and these two would be the arrangements respectively in the\r\ntwo optically active varieties. That this is the correct explanation of\r\nthe ordinary dextro variety and the lævo variety of tartaric acid can\r\nnow admit of no doubt.\r\n\r\nBut if the groups round the two asymmetric carbon atoms are symmetrical\r\nin mirror-image fashion, there will be compensation within the molecule\r\nitself, and the substance will be optically inactive from internal\r\nreasons. This is the explanation of the optically inactive variety which\r\nis unresolvable into any components. The different varieties of this\r\ninactive form are doubtless due to the different possibilities of\r\narrangement of the atoms in each half, while leaving the two halves\r\nround each asymmetric carbon atom symmetrical to each other.\r\n\r\nWe now know that the decomposable inactive variety, racemic acid, may\r\nbe readily obtained by· dissolving equal weights of the ordinary\r\ndextro and lævo varieties in water and crystallising the solution by\r\nslow evaporation at the ordinary temperature. For further\r\ninvestigation has fully borne out the conclusion of Pasteur, that\r\nracemic acid simply consists of a molecular compound of the two active\r\nvarieties. It is thus itself inactive because it is externally\r\ncompensated, the two kinds of enantiomorphous molecules being\r\nalternately regularly distributed throughout the whole crystal\r\nstructure, the very case which von Fedorow, Schönflies, and Barlow\r\nassumed to be possible, and which Sohncke only tardily admitted. The\r\ncrystalline form of racemic acid is, as was to be expected, quite\r\ndifferent from the monoclinic form of the active tartaric acids, being\r\ntriclinic; and indeed it is not crystallographically comparable with\r\nthe active form, inasmuch as the crystals of racemic acid contain a\r\nmolecule of water of crystallisation, whereas the active varieties\r\ncrystallise anhydrous.\r\n\r\nOrdinary dextro and lævo tartaric acids crystallise in identical forms\r\nof the sphenoidal or monoclinic-hemimorphic class of the monoclinic\r\nsystem, the class which is only symmetrical about a digonal axis, the\r\nunique symmetry plane of the monoclinic system, which also operates when\r\nfull monoclinic symmetry is developed, being absent in this class. Hence\r\nthe interfacial crystal angles, the monoclinic axial angle, and the\r\naxial ratios are identical for the two varieties. But the crystals are\r\nhemimorphic, owing to the absence of the symmetry plane, and\r\ncomplementarily so, the dextro variety being distinguished by the\r\npresence of only the right clino-prism {011}, while the lævo variety is\r\ncharacterised by the presence only of the left-clino-prism {0̄11}, these\r\ntwo complementary forms, each composed of only two faces and which on a\r\nholohedral crystal exhibiting the full symmetry of the monoclinic system\r\nwould both be present as a single form of four faces, being never both\r\ndeveloped on the same optically active crystal.\r\n\r\nThis hemimorphism of the two kinds of crystals will be rendered clear by\r\nFigs. 63 and 64, representing typical crystals of dextro and lævo\r\ntartaric acids which are obviously the mirror images of each other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 63.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 64.\r\n\r\n  Crystals of Dextro and Lævo Tartaric Acids.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA remarkable discovery was made by Pasteur in connection with one\r\nof the salts of racemic acid, sodium ammonium racemate,\r\nNa(NH_{4})C_{4}H_{4}O_{6}, or\r\n\r\n                               COONH_{4}\r\n                               |\r\n                               CHOH\r\n                               |\r\n                               CHOH\r\n                               |\r\n                               COONa\r\n\r\nwhich is obtained by adding ammonia to the readily procurable salt\r\nhydrogen sodium racemate. Sodium ammonium racemate was found by Pasteur\r\nto be decomposable into the salts of dextro and lævo tartaric acids, on\r\ncrystallisation of a solution saturated at 28° C. by inoculation with a\r\ncrystal of either of those active salts. The solution on cooling being\r\nin the state of slight supersaturation, which we now know from the work\r\nof Ostwald and of Miers as the metastable condition, corresponding to\r\nthe interval between the solubility and supersolubility curves (see Fig.\r\n98), if a crystal say of sodium ammonium lævo-tartrate be introduced,\r\nthis variety crystallises out first and can be separated from the\r\nresidual dextro-salt, which can then be subsequently crystallised.\r\nMoreover, in certain direct crystallisations of sodium ammonium racemate\r\nwithout such specialised inoculation, Pasteur found all the crystals\r\nhemimorphic, some right-handed and some left-handed, and he was actually\r\nable to isolate from each other crystals of the two varieties. On\r\nseparate recrystallisation of these two sets of crystals, he found them\r\nto retain permanently their right or left-handed character, indicating\r\nthat the molecules themselves composing these crystals were\r\nenantiomorphous. Their solutions correspondingly rotated the plane of\r\npolarisation of light in opposite directions. Pasteur afterwards\r\nobtained from the dextro-salt pure ordinary (dextro) tartaric acid, and\r\nfrom the lævo-salt the lævo-acid, by converting them first into the lead\r\nsalts and then precipitating the lead as sulphide by sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen.\r\n\r\nIn the case of lævo tartaric acid, this was its first isolation, as it\r\nhad hitherto been unknown. Gernez afterwards independently found that a\r\nsaturated solution of sodium ammonium racemate affords crystals of the\r\nlævo-salt just as readily as of the dextro-salt; if a crystal of either\r\nsalt be introduced, crystals corresponding to that variety are produced.\r\n\r\nAnother most fruitful observation of Pasteur, the principle of which has\r\nsince been the means of isolating one of the two constituents of many\r\nracemic compounds, was that when the spores of _Penicillium glaucum_ are\r\nadded to a solution of racemic acid containing traces of phosphates the\r\nordinary dextro component is destroyed by the organism, while the lævo\r\ncomponent is unattacked so long as any dextro remains; hence, if the\r\nfermentation operation be stopped in time the lævo-acid may be isolated\r\nand crystallised. Why a living organism thus eats up by preference one\r\nvariety only, possessing a particular right or left-handed screw\r\nstructure, of a compound containing the same elementary constituents\r\nchemically united in the same manner, remains a most interesting\r\nbiological mystery.\r\n\r\nThe crystals of both dextro and lævo tartaric acids prove to be\r\npyro-electric, that is, develop electric excitation when slightly\r\nheated. The end which exhibits the development of the clinodome develops\r\npositive electricity in each case, when the crystal is allowed to cool\r\nafter warming, so that the two varieties are oppositely pyro-electric,\r\njust as they are oppositely optically active. The most convenient method\r\nof demonstrating the fact is to dust a little of Kundt’s powder, a\r\nmixture of finely powdered red lead and sulphur, through a fine muslin\r\nsieve on to the crystal as it cools. The sulphur becomes negatively\r\nelectrified and the red lead positively by mutual friction of the\r\nparticles in the sifting, and the sulphur thus attaches itself to the\r\npositively electrified part of the crystal and the red lead to the\r\nnegatively electrified end. This phenomenon of the development by the\r\ntwo varieties of an optically active substance of opposite electrical\r\npolarity has since been shown to be a general one.\r\n\r\nFinally, on mixing concentrated solutions containing equivalent weights\r\nof dextro and lævo tartaric acid Pasteur observed that heat was evolved,\r\na sign of chemical combination, and the solution afterwards deposited on\r\ncooling crystals of racemic acid. Hence, the only conclusion possible is\r\nthat racemic acid must be a molecular compound of the two oppositely\r\noptically active tartaric acids. It thus partakes of the character of a\r\ndouble salt, analogous to potassium magnesium sulphate for instance.\r\nConsequently the crystal structure is one in which alternating molecules\r\nof the two acids are uniformly distributed, and the case is actually\r\npresented of two oppositely enantiomorphous sets of molecules producing\r\na homogeneous structure.\r\n\r\nThis interesting pioneer case of tartaric acid has been the cause of\r\nthe term “racemic” being applied to the inactive form of a substance\r\nwhen it is decomposable into two oppositely optically active\r\nenantiomorphous varieties of the substance. No well authenticated\r\nexception has been found, in all the many instances which have been\r\nobserved of the phenomenon since Pasteur’s time, to the fact that\r\noptically active substances exhibit what was formerly termed\r\nhemihedrism; that is, expressing the case in accordance with our later\r\nmore accurate ideas of crystal structure as elucidated in previous\r\nchapters, such substances invariably belong to classes of symmetry\r\npossessing less than the full number of elements of symmetry possible\r\nto the system to which the class belongs. These classes are eleven in\r\nnumber, those possessing no plane of symmetry; they are, namely, the\r\nasymmetric class of the triclinic system, the sphenoidal class of the\r\nmonoclinic system (to which the two tartaric acids, dextro and lævo,\r\nbelong), the bisphenoidal class of the rhombic system, the pyramidal\r\nand trapezohedral classes of the trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal\r\nsystems, and the tetrahedral-pentagonal-dodecahedral and\r\npentagonal-icositetrahedral classes of the cubic system.\r\n\r\nThe optical activity has been proved by Le Bel and Van t’Hoff to be due\r\nin most cases to enantiomorphism of the chemical molecules, that is, to\r\nthe enantiomorphous stereometric arrangement of the atoms in the\r\nmolecules, and therefore also,—as we have just seen, in accordance with\r\nthe geometrical theory of crystal structure,—of the combined\r\npoint-system in the case of each of the two varieties.\r\n\r\nThe point-systems are probably of a spiral screw-like character, either\r\nright-handed or left-handed, as has been shown by Sohncke to be the case\r\nfor the two varieties of quartz, which crystallises in the trapezohedral\r\nclass of the trigonal system, one of the eleven classes just enumerated.\r\nThe example afforded by quartz will be developed fully in the next two\r\nchapters, as this beautifully crystallised mineral enables us to study\r\nand to demonstrate the phenomena of optical activity in a unique manner\r\nand on the large scale.\r\n\r\nThe solutions as well as the crystals are usually optically active in\r\nthe cases where, as in the instance of the tartaric acids, the\r\nsubstances are soluble in water or other solvent. Occasionally, however,\r\nthe optical activity is lost by dissolving in a solvent, and in such\r\ncases it is the point-system only, and not the molecules themselves,\r\nwhich is enantiomorphous. Sodium chlorate, NaClO_{3}, is an instance of\r\nthis kind. Moreover, a crystal can belong, as already mentioned, to one\r\nof the eleven above enumerated classes of symmetry without displaying\r\noptical activity, as all the point-systems possessing the symmetry of\r\nthese eleven classes do not exhibit screw-coincidence movements. Barium\r\nnitrate, Ba(NO_{3})_{2}, is such a case.\r\n\r\nThe two “optical antipodes,” as the dextro and lævo varieties are\r\nconveniently termed, of an optically active substance thus possess an\r\nenantiomorphous crystal structure; but they are alike in their physical\r\nproperties such as density, melting point, optical refraction and optic\r\naxial angle, cleavage, and elasticity. The crystal angles are identical\r\nfor the forms which are developed in common by them, and which are\r\nusually those which the particular low class of symmetry possesses in\r\ncommon with the holohedral class of the system. The crystallographic\r\ndifference between the two varieties comes in with respect to the\r\nspecific forms characteristic of the particular class of lower than full\r\nsystematic symmetry, and these forms are never displayed in common by\r\nthe two varieties, this being the essence of the enantiomorphism. When\r\nthe crystals are not rich in faces, however, it frequently happens that\r\nonly the common forms of higher symmetry just referred to are developed\r\non the crystals, and the two varieties are then indistinguishable in\r\nexterior configuration; it is only on testing their rotatory power,\r\neither by means of a section-plate of the crystal or by means of a\r\nsolution, or their pyro-electric properties, or, lastly, their\r\netch-figures afforded by a trace of a solvent (which etchings on the\r\ncrystal faces are enantiomorphous and an excellent indication of the\r\ntrue symmetry), that their real character can be ascertained. Many\r\nmistakes have been made in the past, and crystals assigned to a higher\r\nthan their true class of symmetry, owing to the investigation of only a\r\nsingle crop of crystals fortuitously poor in the number of forms\r\ndisplayed.\r\n\r\nIn the racemic form, if one should be deposited from the mixed solutions\r\nof the two optical antipodes as a molecular compound of the latter, we\r\nhave an occurrence akin to polymerism, that is, the combination into a\r\nsingle whole entity of a number of molecules, essentially two in the\r\ncase of racemism. Just as polymeric varieties of organic substances are\r\nalways found to have quite different crystalline forms, so an optically\r\ninactive racemic form of a substance is generally quite different\r\ncrystallographically to the dextro and lævo varieties. But there is\r\nusually some similarity along specific zones of the crystals, a kind of\r\nisogonism or morphotropy being developed, such as has been shown to\r\noccur, for instance, by Armstrong and Pope in the case of the substance\r\nsobrerol.[13]\r\n\r\nBesides the true racemic form it is often observed that under certain\r\nconditions crystals are obtained which appear to combine the characters\r\nof both the dextro and lævo varieties, exhibiting both series of\r\ndistinguishing hemimorphic or hemihedral forms on the same crystal; that\r\nis, they show the full, holohedral, symmetry of the system. This has\r\nbeen shown by Kipping and Pope[14] to be due to repeated twinning, thin\r\nlayers of the right and left-handed varieties being alternated, just, in\r\nfact, as in the interesting form of quartz known as amethyst, to which\r\nreference with experimental demonstration will be made in Chapter XIV.;\r\nthe whole structure assumes in consequence the simulated higher symmetry\r\nwhich usually accompanies laminated twinning. Such forms have been\r\ntermed “pseudo-racemic.” In their memoir (_loc. cit._, p. 993) Kipping\r\nand Pope summarise a large amount of highly interesting work on this\r\nchemico-crystallographic subject which has been carried out by them, and\r\nit may be useful to quote their precise definition of the relationship\r\nbetween racemic and pseudo-racemic substances. They say:\r\n\r\n“We define a pseudo-racemic substance as an intercalation of an equal,\r\nor approximately equal, proportion of two enantiomorphously related\r\ncomponents, each of which preserves its characteristic type of\r\ncrystalline structure, but is so intercalated with the other as to form\r\na crystalline individual of non-homogeneous structure. A solid racemic\r\ncompound, on the other hand, may be defined as a crystalline substance\r\nof homogeneous structure which contains an equal proportion of two\r\nenantiomorphously related isomerides.\r\n\r\n“The relations holding between a mere mixture of optical antipodes, a\r\npseudo-racemic substance, and a racemic compound, are closely parallel\r\nto those existing between a crystalline mixture, an isomorphous mixture,\r\nand a double salt. The crystallographic methods, by which a double salt\r\ncan be distinguished from an isomorphous mixture, may be directly\r\napplied to distinguish between racemic and pseudo-racemic substances.\r\nThus, according as the crystalline substance obtained from a mixture of\r\ntwo salts resembles or differs from either of its components\r\ncrystallographically, it is regarded either as an isomorphous mixture or\r\na double salt; similarly, an inactive externally compensated substance,\r\nwhich closely resembles its active isomerides crystallographically, is\r\nto be considered as pseudo-racemic, whereas when the contrary is true,\r\nit is to be regarded as racemic.”\r\n\r\nThe work of Kipping and Pope may be regarded as having finally\r\nvindicated and substantiated the law of Pasteur, that substances of\r\nenantiomorphous molecular configuration develop enantiomorphous\r\ncrystalline structures, and that the crystal structures assumed by\r\nenantiomorphously related molecular configurations are themselves\r\nenantiomorphously related.\r\n\r\nThis subject, the main results and principles of which have now been\r\nelucidated, may well be closed with a reference to an interesting case\r\nof enantiomorphism and optical activity which the author has himself\r\ninvestigated,[15] and which is very similar to the case of the tartaric\r\nacids. It had been previously shown[16] by P. F. Frankland and W. Frew,\r\nthat when calcium glycerate was submitted to the fermenting action of\r\nthe _Bacillus ethaceticus_ one-half only of the glyceric acid was\r\ndestroyed, and that the remaining half was optically active, rotating\r\nthe plane of polarisation to the right.\r\n\r\nNow glyceric acid,\r\n\r\n                               CH_{2}.OH\r\n                               |\r\n                               CH.OH,\r\n                               |\r\n                               COOH\r\n\r\nhas manifestly one so-called asymmetric carbon atom (that is, a carbon\r\natom the four valencies of which are satisfied by attachment to four\r\ndifferent monad elements or groups), that belonging to the CHOH group.\r\nThere are consequently two possible arrangements of the molecule in\r\nspace, probably corresponding to the two optically active varieties,\r\nnamely, those represented, as far as is possible in one plane, as below,\r\nthe asymmetric carbon atom (not shown in the graphic representation)\r\nbeing supposed to be at the centre of the tetrahedron, which is usually\r\ntaken to represent a carbon atom with its four valencies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDextro-glyceric acid itself proved to be an uncrystallisable syrup, but\r\nthe calcium salt, Ca(C_{3}H_{5}O_{4})_{2}.2H_{2}O, was obtained in\r\ncrystals sufficiently well-formed to permit of a complete\r\ncrystallographic investigation, which the author undertook by friendly\r\narrangement with Prof. Frankland. Although the acid itself is\r\ndextro-rotatory, aqueous solutions of the calcium salt are lævo-rotatory\r\nto the extent of –12.09 units of “specific rotation” for sodium light.\r\n\r\nThe crystals were colourless well-formed prisms which proved to be of\r\nmonoclinic symmetry, the best individuals being formed by very slow\r\nevaporation of the aqueous solution. They were terminated at both ends\r\nby pyramid and dome faces, and sometimes grew to the length of a\r\ncentimetre. The actual crystal elements found after a full series of\r\nmeasurements were as under:—\r\n\r\n\r\n                       CALCIUM DEXTRO-GLYCERATE.\r\n\r\n_Crystal system_: monoclinic.\r\n\r\n_Class of Monoclinic System_: sphenoidal or monoclinic-hemimorphic.\r\n\r\n_Habit_: prismatic.\r\n\r\n_Monoclinic axial angle_: β=69° 6′.\r\n\r\n_Ratio of axes_: _a_ : _b_ : _c_ = 1.4469 : 1 : 0.6694.\r\n\r\n_Forms observed_:\r\n\r\n          _a_ = {100}, _c_ = {001}, _r′_ = {̄201}, _p_ = {110},\r\n          _m_ = {011}, _o_ = {111}  _s_ = {̄1̄11},  _n_ = {̄2̄11}.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that the system and the class are precisely those\r\nof the two active tartaric acids, which renders the case the more\r\ninteresting. The usual appearance of the crystals is shown in Fig. 65,\r\nand the stereographic projection is given in Fig. 66, which will\r\nelucidate the symmetry more clearly, the plane of projection being the\r\nplane of symmetry The latter, however, in this class is inoperative, the\r\ntwo ends of the digonal symmetry axis, which runs perpendicularly to the\r\nplane of the paper, being differently terminated, as in the tartaric\r\nacids. The faces of the forms _o_ = {111} and _m_ = {011} were never\r\nfound developed on the left side of the symmetry plane, that is, on the\r\nleft side of the crystal as drawn in Fig. 65, the symmetry plane running\r\nperpendicularly to the paper vertically from front to back; they were\r\nonly present on the right. Conversely, the faces of _s_ = {̄1̄11} and\r\n_n_ = {̄2̄11} were never found developed on the right, but only on the\r\nleft of the plane of possible symmetry.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it was frequently observed that the right-hand faces (110) and\r\n(̄110) of the primary prismform _p_ were much more brilliant and truly\r\nplane than those on the left hand, (1̄10) and (̄1̄10), which were\r\nusually dull and often curved, as were also frequently the faces of the\r\nleft-hand forms _s_ and _n_. The right-hand distinguishing forms _m_ and\r\n_o_, on the contrary, were generally most brilliant and gave admirable\r\nreflections of the goniometer signal-slit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 65.—Crystal of Calcium Dextro-Glycerate.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 66.—Stereographic Projection of Calcium Dextro-Glycerate.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe following table represents the results of the angular measurements,\r\ntwelve different well-formed individual crystals having been employed.\r\nThe angles marked with an asterisk were the important angles the mean\r\nobserved values of which were accepted as correct, being the best\r\nmeasured angles, and which were therefore used as the basis of the\r\ncalculations.\r\n\r\n            _Table of Interfacial Angles of Calcium Glycerate._\r\n\r\n  Angle measured.

And it was conclusively demonstrated by the goniometrical part\r\nof the investigation that the exterior symmetry was not such as agreed\r\nwith holohedral monoclinic symmetry, but with that of the sphenoidal\r\nclass, in which the only one of the two elements of monoclinic symmetry\r\n(the plane of symmetry and the digonal axis of symmetry) in operation is\r\nthe digonal axis, thus leaving the two terminations of that axis, at\r\nopposite sides, right and left, of the possible symmetry plane,\r\nunsymmetrical. And this is precisely the symmetry which is\r\ncharacteristic of an enantiomorphous optically active substance.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the corresponding lævo-salt has not yet been obtained in\r\nmeasurable crystals, but there can be no doubt that whenever such are\r\nforthcoming they will display enantiomorphism in the precisely opposite\r\nand complementary sense, the facial forms characteristic in this\r\ndextro-salt of the right termination of the digonal axis being absent on\r\nthat side of the systematic symmetry plane but developed on the left\r\nside instead, and _vice versa_, and that the two enantiomorphous forms\r\nwill together make up the whole of the faces required by the full\r\nsymmetry of the monoclinic system.\r\n\r\nA concrete instance like this, worked out practically in the laboratory,\r\nbrings home the precise nature of this interesting relationship, between\r\ncrystallographic and molecular enantiomorphism on the one hand and\r\noptical activity on the other hand, in a particularly clear and forcible\r\nmanner. It is hoped that this brief account of it will also consequently\r\nhave been of assistance to the reader, in more clearly appreciating the\r\nmain points of this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\nEFFECT OF THE SYMMETRY OF CRYSTALS ON THE PASSAGE OF LIGHT THROUGH THEM.\r\n                QUARTZ, CALCITE, AND GYPSUM AS EXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action of transparent crystals on the rays of light which they\r\ntransmit is a subject not only of the deepest interest, but also of the\r\nutmost importance. For it is immediately possible to detect a cubic\r\ncrystal, and to discriminate between two groups, optically uniaxial and\r\nbiaxial respectively, of the other six systems of symmetry, three\r\nsystems going to each group, by this means alone. For a cubic crystal is\r\nsingly refractive in all directions. A 60°-prism, for instance, cut from\r\na cube of rock-salt, for the purpose of obtaining the refractive index\r\nof the mineral by the ordinary method of producing a spectrum and\r\narranging it for minimum deviation of the refracted rays, affords but a\r\nsingle spectrum, or a single sharp image of the spectrometer slit when\r\nthe latter is fed by pure monochromatic light instead of ordinary white\r\nlight. This is true however the prism may have been cut, as regards its\r\norientation with respect to the natural crystal faces.\r\n\r\nBut a 60°-prism cut from a crystal belonging to the optically biaxial\r\ngroup, composed of the rhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic systems of\r\nsymmetry, will always afford two images of the slit or two spectra,\r\ncorresponding to two indices of refraction; and, when the orientation of\r\nthe prism is arranged so that the refracting angle is bisected by a\r\nprincipal plane of the ellipsoid which represents the optical\r\nproperties, and the refracting edge is parallel to one of the principal\r\naxes of the optical ellipsoid, the prism, when arranged for minimum\r\ndeviation of the light rays, will at once afford two of the three\r\nrefractive indices, α, β, γ, corresponding to light vibrations along two\r\nof the three principal axial directions of the ellipsoid. The two\r\nindices which the prism affords will be (1) the one which corresponds to\r\nvibrations parallel to the refracting edge, and (2) that which\r\ncorresponds to undulations perpendicular to the edge and to the\r\ndirection of transmission of the light through the prism (the third axis\r\nof the ellipsoid). For the vibrations of the light in the two rays into\r\nwhich the beam is divided on entering the crystal are both perpendicular\r\nto the direction of transmission and to each other; the two images or\r\nspectra produced owing to the double refraction, that is, owing to the\r\ndifferent velocities of the two mutually rectangularly vibrating rays,\r\nthus correctly afford the means of determining two of the three\r\nprincipal (axial) refractive indices.\r\n\r\nGypsum, the monoclinic hydrated sulphate of lime, CaSO_{4}.2H_{2}O,\r\nalready referred to in connection with the Mitscherlich experiment in\r\nChapter VII., is an excellent substance to employ for the demonstration\r\nof this fact, by cutting and polishing a 60°-prism out of a clear\r\ntransparent crystal of the mineral as above described; and if a Nicol\r\nprism be introduced in the path of the rays, one spectrum or\r\nmonochromatic image will be extinguished when the Nicol is arranged at\r\nits 0° position, and the other when the Nicol is rotated 90° from this\r\nposition. This proves that the two rays affording the two refractive\r\nindices are polarised in planes at right angles to each other, and,\r\nmoreover, enables us to verify that the planes in which the vibrations\r\nof the two rays occur are actually parallel and perpendicular\r\nrespectively to the refracting edge of the prism. For the two\r\nextinctions occur when the vibration plane of the Nicol is either\r\nvertical, parallel to the prism edge, or horizontal, perpendicular\r\nthereto.\r\n\r\nIf a second prism be cut complementarily to the first, that is, so that\r\nthe refracting edge is parallel to the third axis of the ellipsoid (the\r\ndirection of transmission through the first prism) and the bisecting\r\nplane again parallel to one of the three axial planes of the ellipsoid,\r\nsuch a prism will also yield two refracted images corresponding to two\r\nindices; one of them, that particular image the vibrations of which are\r\nparallel to the refracting edge, will correspond to that one of the\r\nthree principal indices which was not given by the first prism, while\r\nthe other one will afford a duplicate determination of one of the two\r\nindices afforded by the first prism. Hence, a couple of such axially\r\norientated prisms of a rhombic, monoclinic, or triclinic crystal will\r\nenable us to determine all three refractive indices, and one of them in\r\nduplicate, which latter fact will enable us to check the accuracy of our\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIf the 60°-prism be cut from a crystal of the uniaxial group, that is,\r\nfrom a hexagonal, tetragonal, or trigonal crystal—quartz or calcite\r\nbeing admirable examples of the latter and particularly suitable for\r\ndemonstration purposes—it will generally afford two spectra in the same\r\nmanner as a crystal of the three birefringent systems of lower symmetry.\r\nBut there is one special mode of cutting which results in the prism\r\nexhibiting only a single spectrum, namely, when the hexagonal,\r\ntetragonal, or trigonal axis of symmetry, which is also the unique\r\n“optic axis” of the crystal along which there is no double refraction,\r\nis arranged to be perpendicular to the bisecting plane of the 60°-prism.\r\nFor then the light is transmitted along this unique axial direction when\r\nthe prism is arranged for the minimum deviation of the refracted rays\r\nout of their original path, and as it may vibrate in any direction\r\nperpendicular thereto with equal velocity there is no separation into\r\ntwo rays, that is, no double refraction, and thus only a single spectrum\r\nis afforded by such a prism in white light, or a single image of the\r\nslit in monochromatic light, and this latter will at once yield the\r\nrefractive index which is generally indicated conventionally by the\r\nletter ω, corresponding to light vibrations perpendicular to the axis.\r\n\r\nSpectroscopists take advantage of this interesting fact, when they\r\nemploy a train of quartz prisms so cut in order to explore the violet\r\nand ultra-violet region of the spectrum; for quartz transmits many of\r\nthe ultra-violet rays which glass absorbs. Each prism gives only a\r\nsingle image like glass, whereas if it were otherwise cut it would give\r\ntwo spectra, which would so complicate matters as to render quartz\r\nuseless for the purpose.\r\n\r\nWhen the prism of quartz or calcite, or of any hexagonal, tetragonal, or\r\ntrigonal substance, is cut so that the rays of light are transmitted\r\nthrough it perpendicularly to the axis, and so that the refracting edge\r\nis parallel to the axis, the light is broken up into two rays, one of\r\nwhich is composed of light vibrating parallel to the edge and therefore\r\nto the axis, and the other of light vibrating perpendicularly to the\r\naxis. Such a prism consequently affords the two principal extreme\r\nrefractive indices of the crystal, ω and ε, the latter letter being\r\nalways assigned to the refractive index of a uniaxial crystal\r\ncorresponding to vibrations parallel to the axis.\r\n\r\nA uniaxial crystal, one belonging to the hexagonal, tetragonal, or\r\ntrigonal systems, has thus two principal refractive indices, ω and ε,\r\nwhile a biaxial crystal, one belonging to the rhombic, monoclinic, or\r\ntriclinic systems of symmetry, has three, α, β, γ, corresponding to\r\nvibrations respectively parallel to the three rectangular axial\r\ndirections of the optical ellipsoid, which are also the crystallographic\r\naxial directions in the case of a rhombic crystal. The index α is the\r\nminimum, and γ the maximum refractive index,the β index being\r\nintermediate; when the latter lies nearer to α in value, the crystal is\r\nsaid to be a positive one, but when nearer to γ the crystal is\r\nconventionally supposed to be negative. Similarly, when in a uniaxial\r\ncrystal ε is the greater, as it is in the case of quartz, the crystal is\r\ntermed positive, but if ω be the greater index, as happens in the case\r\nof calcite, then the crystal is by convention considered negative.\r\n\r\nJust as in the case of gypsum, which is a positive biaxial crystal (the\r\nreason for the term biaxial will presently be more fully explained),\r\nwhen the two spectra afforded by a prism of calcite or quartz cut to\r\nafford both ε and ω are examined in plane polarised light, by\r\nintroducing a Nicol prism somewhere in the path of the light, the two\r\nimages corresponding respectively to ε and ω will be found to be\r\nproduced by light polarised in two planes at right angles to each other.\r\nFor when the Nicol is at its 0° position one will be extinguished, and\r\nwhen it is at 90° the other will be quenched. At the 45° position of the\r\nNicol both images will be visible with their partial intensities, as\r\nhappens also in the cases of biaxial prisms.\r\n\r\nThis behaviour of 60°-prisms of crystals belonging to the seven\r\ndifferent styles of crystal architecture, as compared with a prism of\r\nglass or other transparent non-crystalline substance, is extremely\r\ninstructive. For not only is the optical constant refractive index—the\r\nmeasure of the power exhibited by the crystal of bending light,\r\ncorresponding to its effect in retarding by the nature of its internal\r\nstructure the velocity of the light vibrations—the most important of all\r\nthe optical constants, but also in the course of its determination we\r\nlearn more of the behaviour of crystals towards light than from any\r\nother type of optical experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 67.—Experiment to show Rectangular Polarisation of the two\r\n    Spectra afforded by a 60°-Prism of a Doubly Refracting Crystal cut\r\n    to afford two Indices of Refraction.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 67 is shown a convenient mode of demonstrating the experiment\r\nwith the aid of the electric lantern and one of the large Nicol prisms\r\nof the projection polariscope, already briefly described in Chapter VII.\r\nin connection with the Mitscherlich experiment. The 60°-prism is\r\narranged on a small adjustable stand nearest the screen; then comes the\r\nNicol polarising prism of 2½ to 3 inches clear aperture, behind which is\r\nthe projecting lens, at the focus of which is placed the adjustable slit\r\non a separate stand. The slit is filled with light from the condenser of\r\nthe electric lantern, and in the lantern front a thick water cell is\r\narranged, in order to remove sufficient of the heat rays which accompany\r\nthe light beam to avoid damage to the balsam joint of the calcite Nicol.\r\nWhen all the parts are properly arranged a sharp image of the slit\r\nshould first be thrown on the screen directly, in the temporary absence\r\nof the 60°-prism, and then on replacing the latter at the proper angle\r\nfor minimum deviation, when the light traverses the prism parallel to\r\nits third unused side, a spectrum or pair of spectra—according to the\r\nposition of the Nicol and to the nature of the 60°-prism as explained in\r\nthe foregoing discussion of the possibilities—will be projected on a\r\nsecond screen (or the same one if movable) arranged at the proper angle\r\nto receive the refracted rays.\r\n\r\nIf a single spectrum be afforded, which remains single on rotation of\r\nthe Nicol, the prism is of glass or of a uniaxial crystal cut so that\r\nthe light passes along the optic axis. If two spectra be shown when the\r\nNicol is arranged in the neighbourhood of its 45° position, the crystal\r\nis a doubly refracting one, and if orientated so that the single optic\r\naxis, if the crystal be uniaxial, is parallel to the refracting edge,\r\nor, if the crystal be biaxial, so that the refracting edge is parallel\r\nto one of the three principal axes of the optical ellipsoid and its\r\nbisecting plane is parallel not only to this but also to a second\r\nprincipal axis, then one spectrum, corresponding to one principal\r\nrefractive index, will extinguish when the Nicol is rotated to its 0°\r\nposition, and the other spectrum, corresponding to a second principal\r\nrefractive index, will be quenched on rotation of the Nicol to its 90°\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThe separation of the two spectra on the screen depends on the amount of\r\nthe double refraction, and in the case of calcite this is exceptionally\r\nlarge, so that the two spectra are widely separated on the screen. They\r\ndiffer also considerably in dispersion. In the case of quartz the double\r\nrefraction is very small, and the spectral images of the slit are\r\nconsequently so close together as almost to touch one another. The pair\r\nof spectra afforded by gypsum are similarly very close together, owing\r\nalso to weak double refraction. The amount of the double refraction is\r\nmeasured by the difference between the uniaxial indices ε and ω, or that\r\nbetween the minimum and maximum biaxial indices α and γ. The two spectra\r\ngiven by quartz and calcite will correspond to ε and ω, and the greatest\r\nseparation of spectra occurs in the case of gypsum when the spectra are\r\nthose corresponding to α and γ, and not to α and β or β and γ.\r\n\r\nIt will now be useful and very helpful to examine more closely into the\r\nnature of the beautiful mineral quartz, in order that a series of\r\ninteresting experiments may be described with it, which will assist\r\nlargely in rendering the optical characters of crystals clear to us.\r\n\r\n_Quartz_, rock-crystal, although perhaps the commonest and best known of\r\nall crystallised substances, the naturally occurring dioxide of silicon\r\nSiO_{2}, is yet one of the most remarkable and fascinatingly\r\ninteresting. To begin with, as explained in the last chapter, quartz\r\nbelongs to one of the eleven enantiomorphous classes of lower than full\r\nsystematic symmetry, those which exhibit two mirror-image forms related\r\nto one another like a pair of gloves. The particular class of the eleven\r\nto which quartz belongs is the trapezohedral class of the trigonal\r\nsystem, and two typical left-handed and right-handed crystals are shown\r\nin Fig. 68 and Fig. 69 respectively.\r\n\r\nThere is one principal form which is common to both the hexagonal and\r\ntrigonal systems, namely, the hexagonal prism, and this is the chief\r\nform exhibited by quartz crystals. They are terminated by an apparently\r\nhexagonal pyramid, but which really consists of a pair of complementary\r\nrhombohedra, which are purely trigonal forms; three upper faces of each\r\nrhombohedron are developed at one end of the prism which may be regarded\r\nas the upper, and the three lower faces of each of the two individual\r\nrhombohedra likewise at the lower end of a fully developed doubly\r\nterminated crystal. The rhombohedron is the characteristic form of the\r\ntrigonal system of crystal symmetry, the systematic crystallographic\r\naxes being parallel to its edges. It is like a cube deformed by\r\nextension or compression along a diagonal, which latter is arranged\r\nvertically, and becomes the trigonal axis of symmetry (not a\r\ncrystallographic axis), as shown in Fig. 70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 68.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 69.\r\n\r\n  Left-handed and Right-handed Crystals of Quartz.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen two rhombohedra are equally developed, one being rotated with\r\nrespect to the other 60° round the vertical trigonal axis of symmetry,\r\nthey together resemble a hexagonal pyramid, and crystals of quartz thus\r\nterminated at both ends are not uncommon, so that at first sight a\r\nquartz crystal might be mistaken for a hexagonal prism doubly terminated\r\nby the hexagonal pyramid, and the mineral considered, in error, to\r\nbelong to the hexagonal system.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 70.—The Rhombohedron and its Axes.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut one alternate set of three faces of the hexagonal pyramid at one\r\nend, and the oppositely alternate set of three similar faces at the\r\nother end, will usually be found to be much less brilliant (indeed often\r\nquite dull) than the other alternate three, and very frequently also the\r\namount of development is markedly different, both facts indicating that\r\nthe terminal faces belong to two different but complementary\r\nrhombohedral forms, and that the system of symmetry is the trigonal and\r\nnot hexagonal.\r\n\r\nBut there is much stronger evidence than this for trigonal symmetry. For\r\nthe little faces marked _s_ and _x_ on Figs. 68 and 69 are\r\ncharacteristic of the trapezohedral class of the trigonal system, and it\r\nwill be observed that on one crystal, Fig. 68, these faces occupy and\r\nmodify a left-hand corner or solid angle on the crystal, while on the\r\nother crystal, Fig. 69, they occupy and replace a right-hand solid\r\nangle. Now, if a plate be cut out of the former crystal perpendicularly\r\nto the axis of the hexagonal prism, that is, to the optic axis of the\r\ntrigonal uniaxial crystal, it will be found to rotate the plane of\r\npolarisation to the left, the direction in which the small faces are\r\nsituated; while if a similar plate be cut out of the right-handed\r\ncrystal shown in Fig. 69, that is, one which has the small faces on the\r\nright, it will be observed to rotate the plane of polarisation to the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nAs quartz possesses the symmetry of the trigonal system and is thus\r\noptically uniaxial, its optical properties are expressed, in common with\r\nthose of all trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal crystals, by an\r\nellipsoid of revolution, an ellipsoid the section of which perpendicular\r\nto the principal axis—that of revolution, the maximum or minimum\r\ndiameter of the ellipsoid—is a circle. The optical properties are\r\nconsequently the same in all directions round this axis, which has\r\nalready been referred to by its common appellation of the “optic axis.”\r\n\r\nThe optic axis is identical in direction with the trigonal axis of\r\nsymmetry in the case of quartz or other trigonal crystal, and in the\r\ncases of hexagonal and tetragonal crystals with the axes of hexagonal\r\nand tetragonal symmetry, these three axes of specific symmetry being the\r\ndistinctive property of these three respective systems, which are thus\r\nknown in common as optically “uniaxial.”\r\n\r\nConsequently, no double refraction is suffered by a ray transmitted\r\nparallel to the optic axis, and the refractive index is equal in all\r\ndirections perpendicular to the optic axis, that is, for all rays\r\nvibrating perpendicularly to the axis; hence the value of the refractive\r\nindex obtained along any such direction is one extreme value for the\r\nwhole crystal, and as already mentioned is distinguished by the letter\r\nω. The refractive index along the direction of the axis itself is the\r\nother extreme value, and is labelled ε. It must be clearly appreciated,\r\nhowever, that it is not the direction of transmission but that of\r\nvibration perpendicular thereto, that is meant when it is said that, for\r\ninstance, the direction of the axis corresponds to the index ε. That is\r\nto say, a ray the _vibrations_ of which occur parallel to the optic axis\r\nof a uniaxial crystal is refracted to an amount which corresponds to the\r\nrefractive index ε, while a ray the vibrations of which occur\r\nperpendicularly to the axis affords ω. The difference between ε and ω is\r\nthe measure of the double refraction of the crystal.\r\n\r\nIn the case of quartz ε is the greater, being 1.5534 for sodium light,\r\nquartz being thus positive according to the convention already alluded\r\nto; while ω is the smaller, namely, 1.5443. In the case of the other\r\nwidely distributed trigonally uniaxial mineral calcite, carbonate of\r\nlime CaCO_{3}, the opposite is the case, ω being the greater, having the\r\nvalue 1.6583 for sodium light, and ω the less, namely, 1.4864, calcite\r\nbeing thus a negatively uniaxial substance. The amount of the double\r\nrefraction in the cases of the two minerals is very different, ε-ω for\r\nquartz being 0.0091, and ω-ε for calcite being as much as 0.1719.\r\nCalcite is indeed a mineral endowed with an especially large amount of\r\ndouble refraction, a property which renders it so eminently suitable for\r\nuse in demonstrating the phenomenon, and for the construction of the\r\nNicol polarising prism, in which one of the two mutually perpendicularly\r\npolarised rays, that which affords the index ω, is got rid of by total\r\nreflection at a balsam joint, a large rhomb of calcite being cut in half\r\nalong a particular diagonal plane and the two halves cemented together\r\nagain with Canada balsam; the other ray, which affords ε (but not at its\r\nminimum value), is transmitted as a beam of perfectly polarised light.\r\n\r\nThe result of this difference in the amount of the double refraction of\r\nthe two minerals quartz and calcite is very interesting as regards their\r\nbehaviour with polarised light. A thin plate of quartz, such as is often\r\nfound in the slices of rock sections employed for microscopic\r\ninvestigation, of muscovite granite or quartz porphyry for instance, and\r\nwhich is usually about one-fiftieth of a millimetre in thickness, shows\r\nbrilliant colours in a parallel beam of polarised light, the Nicol\r\nprisms of the polarising microscope being crossed for the production of\r\nthe dark field before the introduction of the section-plate on the\r\nstage. This is only true, however, when the plate has not been cut\r\nperpendicularly to the axis, for such a thin plate thus cut does not\r\nperceptibly affect the dark field, there being no double refraction of\r\nrays transmitted along the axis, and the interference colours afforded\r\nby crystal plates in polarised light being due to the interference of\r\nthe two rays produced by double refraction, one of which is retarded\r\nbehind the other so as to be in a different phase of vibration. Also,\r\nthe plate, even when cut obliquely, and best of all parallel, to the\r\naxis, has to be rotated in its own plane (perpendicular to the optical\r\naxis of the microscope), to the favourable position for the production\r\nof the most brilliant colour. This especially favourable position is\r\nhalfway between (at 45° to) the positions at which darkness is afforded\r\nby the plate. For on rotating the plate between the crossed Nicols it\r\nbecomes four times dark during a complete revolution, and at places\r\nexactly 90° apart, known as the “extinction positions,” whenever, in\r\nfact, that plane perpendicular to the plate which contains the optic\r\naxis is parallel to the plane of polarisation of either the polarising\r\nor analysing Nicol. At the intermediate 45° positions the maximum colour\r\nis produced.\r\n\r\nThe colour owes its origin, as already mentioned, to the interference of\r\nthe two rays, corresponding to the two refractive indices, into which\r\nthe light is divided on entering the crystal in any direction except\r\nalong the axis. For one of the rays is retarded behind the other owing\r\nto the difference in velocity which is expressed reciprocally\r\n(inversely) by the refractive indices, and thus a difference of phase is\r\nproduced between the two light-wave motions, with the inevitable result\r\nof interference when the vibrations have been reduced to the same plane\r\nby the analyser; light of one particular wave-length is then\r\nextinguished, and the plate therefore exhibits a tint in which the\r\ncomplementary colour to that extinguished predominates. The light which\r\nleaves the polarising Nicol is vibrating in one plane, but on reaching\r\nthe crystal this is resolved into two rays vibrating at right angles to\r\neach other, and at 45° on each side of its previous direction of\r\nvibration, supposing the crystal to be arranged for the production of\r\nmost brilliant colour. On reaching the analysing Nicol, the function of\r\nwhich is to bring the two vibrations again into the same plane, these\r\ntwo rays are each separately resolved back to the planes of vibration of\r\nthe two Nicols, and that pair (one from each ray) vibrating parallel to\r\nthe analysing Nicol are transmitted, while the other pair are\r\nextinguished. The two former rays thus surviving, one individual ray of\r\nthe two having one refractive index and the other individual the other\r\nindex, are thus in a position to interfere; for they are composed of\r\nvibrations in the same plane and of practically the same intensity, and\r\ndiffer only in phase. Extinction occurs when this amounts to half a\r\nwave-length, or an odd multiple of this, to which, however, requires to\r\nbe added half a wave difference of phase which is introduced by the\r\noperation of the analyser. This explanation is a general one, applicable\r\nto thin plates of crystals belonging to all the six systems of symmetry\r\nother than the cubic. For plates of the latter, unless they are in an\r\nabnormal condition of strain, do not polarise.\r\n\r\nWhen we take a plate of calcite of the same small thickness as that of\r\nthe quartz in a rock section, thinner than a sheet of thin paper, we\r\nfind that the calcite does not polarise. So great is the retardation of\r\none of the two rays behind the other in calcite, that a plate\r\nexcessively thin is required in order that colour shall be observed. For\r\nthe colours of crystal plates under the polariscope, due to double\r\nrefraction, are subject to the same laws as the colours of thin films,\r\nnamely, that as the thickness increases—introducing more and more\r\nretardation in the case of a crystal, just as in a thin film greater\r\nlength of path is introduced with increase of thickness—the various\r\ntints of all the seven orders of Newton’s spectra are exhibited in turn,\r\neach spectrum differing by one further wave-length of retardation, and\r\nafter the seventh the white of the higher orders (white light mixed with\r\ncolour, the latter thus appearing only as a faint tint) gives place to\r\ntrue white light, colour being no longer perceptible. Hence with\r\ncalcite, owing to the extremely powerful double refraction, and\r\ntherefore very considerable retardation of the slower ray behind the\r\nquicker, a plate a fiftieth of a millimetre only in thickness already\r\nshows the white of the higher orders, that is, appears only very feebly\r\ntinted with colour, and a plate of calcite very much thinner still is\r\nrequired to show brilliant colours. A plate of calcite, therefore, cut\r\nobliquely or parallel to the optic axis, of the thickness of a rock\r\nsection or thicker, simply appears four times dark and four times light\r\nalternately, at positions 45° apart, as the section-plate is rotated in\r\nits own plane perpendicular to the axis of the polariscope.\r\n\r\nWhen a plate of either quartz or calcite one-fiftieth of an inch thick,\r\ncut perpendicularly to the optic axis, is examined under the polariscope\r\nor polarising microscope, the dark field is unaffected by its\r\nintroduction on the stage, remaining dark on a complete rotation of the\r\ncrystal plate in its own plane. Moreover, the calcite plate continues to\r\nbehave similarly however much the thickness is increased, the field\r\nremaining dark. But when quartz is examined as regards the effect of\r\nthickness an extraordinary thing happens. As the plate is thickened,\r\nthat is, as a series of plates of gradually increasing thickness are\r\nsuccessively placed on the stage, the dark field begins to brighten, and\r\neventually colour makes its appearance. Moreover, rotation of the plate\r\nin its own plane—supposing the latter to be strictly perpendicular to\r\nthe axis of the polariscope and the plate itself to have been truly cut\r\nperpendicularly to the optic axis of the quartz crystal—produces no\r\nchange whatever, the colour remaining the same and evenly distributed\r\nover the plate, thus differing from the previous phenomena of\r\ninterference due to double refraction. When monochromatic light is\r\nemployed, yellow sodium light for instance, it is found that if the\r\nplate be not too thick, say a millimetre in thickness, the dark field is\r\nrestored when the analyser is rotated in a particular direction, either\r\nto the right or to the left, for a specific angle, which is 21° 42′ for\r\na plate of quartz one millimetre thick. Moreover, if the plate has been\r\ncut from a crystal showing the distinctive trapezohedral-class faces s\r\nand x on the right (Fig. 69) the analysing Nicol requires to be rotated\r\nto the right; whereas if the plate has been cut from a crystal showing\r\nthese little determinative faces on the left (Fig. 68) the analyser has\r\nto be rotated to the left in order to quench the light.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, therefore, that the colours of these thicker plates of\r\nquartz are due to the phenomenon of “optical activity.” The original\r\nplane of polarisation of the light received from the polarising Nicol is\r\nrotated by the quartz plate, and to an extent which is directly\r\nproportional to the thickness. When white light is used a particular\r\ncolour is extinguished for each position of the analyser, and the\r\ncomplementary colour therefore predominates in the tint actually\r\nexhibited. Now the most intensely luminous part of the spectrum is about\r\nwave-length 0.000550 millimetre in the yellow, and in the case of a\r\nplate of quartz 7.5 millimetres thick this colour is extinguished when\r\nthe Nicols are crossed, while a plate of half this thickness, 3.75 mm.,\r\nactually exhibits the colour under crossed Nicols and extinguishes it\r\nunder parallel Nicols. For the angle of rotation of the plane of\r\npolarisation for light of this wave-length is 90° for a plate 3.75 mm.\r\nthick, so that the analyser has to be turned through a right angle from\r\nthe crossed position, that is, placed parallel to the polariser, in\r\norder to extinguish this colour. A plate of double the thickness, 7.5\r\nmm., will require the analyser to be rotated through 180°, the angle of\r\nrotation for this thickness of plate, in order to extinguish this yellow\r\nray. But 180° rotation simply brings the Nicol again to the crossed\r\nposition, so that no rotation is really necessary at all.\r\n\r\nNow the complementary colour to the yellow of wave-length 0.000550 mm.\r\nis the transition violet tint, the well-known “tint of passage” between\r\nthe brilliant red end of the first order spectrum of Newton and the deep\r\nblue of the beginning of the second order. Hence, this violet tint is\r\nafforded by a plate of 7.5 mm. thickness when the Nicols are crossed,\r\nand by a plate of 3.75 mm. thickness when they are parallel. When,\r\ntherefore, these plates are examined respectively under crossed and\r\nparallel Nicols, and the analysing Nicol is turned ever so little, the\r\ntint changes remarkably rapidly into brilliant red or blue, according to\r\nthe direction of the rotation of the Nicol and the nature, whether right\r\nor left-handed, of the quartz. Moreover, when two complementary plates\r\nof each thickness are thus examined, one of each pair being cut from a\r\nright-handed crystal and the other from a left-handed one, the colour\r\nwill be red in one case and blue in the other for the same direction of\r\nrotation of the analyser.\r\n\r\nA composite plate is frequently found very useful in work in connection\r\nwith optical rotation, and is known as a “biquartz,” two plates of\r\nopposite rotations being cemented together by Canada balsam, the plane\r\nof junction being made perpendicular to the plate so as to be almost\r\ninvisible when the plate is examined normally. When polarised light is\r\nemployed, the least rotation of the analyser from exact crossing with\r\nthe polariser, for which the violet transition tint is evenly produced\r\nover the whole composite plate, causes the half on one side of the plane\r\nof junction (appearing as a fine line) to turn red and the other half to\r\nturn blue or green.\r\n\r\nThis, in essence, is the nature of the optical activity of quartz, and\r\nthe secondary effects derived from it influence all the optical\r\nphenomena afforded by this interesting mineral. Owing to the fact that\r\nquartz crystals are practically unendowed with any facility for\r\ncleavage, the natural rhombohedral cleavage being very imperfectly\r\ndeveloped and rarely seen, it is possible to cut, grind, and polish\r\nlarge plates of this beautiful, colourless, and limpidly transparent\r\nmineral without a trace of flaw. Such quartz plates of large size,\r\nadequate to fill the field of a large projection polariscope, the stage\r\naperture of which is nearly 2 inches in diameter, form magnificent\r\npolarising objects for the projection on the screen of the effects\r\nobserved in polarised light. As many of the optical properties of\r\ncrystals may be illustrated with their aid, it is proposed in the next\r\ntwo chapters to describe a few of the more interesting screen\r\nexperiments which can be performed with quartz, first (Chapter XIII.) in\r\nconvergent polarised light, and then (Chapter XIV.) in parallel\r\npolarised light, and thus to illustrate the facts relating to the\r\nconnection between optical activity and the internal structure of\r\ncrystals in a manner which will at the same time be interesting and will\r\nlead to their much clearer comprehension.\r\n\r\nThe experiments described are largely those with which the author\r\nillustrated his lecture to the British Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science during their 1909 meeting at Winnipeg.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\nEXPERIMENTS IN CONVERGENT POLARISED LIGHT WITH QUARTZ, AS AN EXAMPLE OF\r\n      MIRROR-IMAGE SYMMETRY AND ITS ACCOMPANYING OPTICAL ACTIVITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been shown that crystals are optically divisible into two\r\nclasses characterised respectively by single and by double refraction.\r\nSingly refractive crystals belong exclusively to the system of highest\r\nsymmetry, the cubic. They afford obviously only one index of refraction,\r\nwhich is generally symbolised by the Greek letter μ, the value of this\r\nconstant being the same for all directions throughout the crystal.\r\nCrystals of the other six systems of symmetry are all doubly refractive.\r\nThose of the trigonal, tetragonal, and hexagonal systems have been shown\r\nin the last chapter to possess two refractive indices, a maximum and a\r\nminimum, one represented by ε corresponding to light vibrating parallel\r\nto the singular axis of the system, the trigonal, tetragonal, or\r\nhexagonal axis of symmetry, and another signified by ω corresponding to\r\nlight vibrations perpendicular to that axis. For the properties are\r\nidentical in all directions around this axis, which is thus the optic\r\naxis as well as the predominating crystallographic one. Such crystals\r\nare consequently known as “uniaxial.” When ε is the larger refractive\r\nindex the crystal is positive, while if ω be the maximum the crystal is\r\nsaid to be negative. It has been shown in the last chapter that quartz\r\nbelongs to the positive category, while calcite is negative. Along the\r\none direction of the optic axis these uniaxial crystals behave like\r\nsingly refractive crystals do in all directions.\r\n\r\nCrystals of the rhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic systems of symmetry\r\nhave also a minimum refractive index, symbolised by α, and a maximum\r\nindex indicated by γ, corresponding to light vibrating parallel to two\r\ndirections at right angles to each other; the third direction\r\nperpendicular to both these and normal to their plane does not afford an\r\nindex of refraction equal to either of these, however, as in the case of\r\na uniaxial crystal, but one of an intermediate value, for which the\r\nsecond letter β of the Greek alphabet is reserved. Whether this value β\r\nis nearer to the minimum α or to the maximum γ determines the\r\nconventional optical sign of the crystal, whether positive or negative.\r\nIn the case of the rhombic system the three rectangular directions in\r\nquestion are identical with the three rectangular crystallographic axes.\r\nIn the monoclinic system the single symmetry axis normal to the unique\r\nplane of symmetry is identical in direction with either the α, β, or γ\r\noptical direction, but in the triclinic system there are no coincidences\r\nbetween the crystal axes and those of the optical ellipsoid. Along none\r\nof these axial directions of the optical ellipsoid which can be imagined\r\nto express graphically the refractive index—an ellipsoid known as the\r\noptical “indicatrix,” and which has been shown by Fletcher to be a more\r\nconvenient mode of expressing the optical characters of a crystal than\r\nthe vibration-velocity ellipsoid of Fresnel—do the optical properties\r\nresemble those of a uniaxial crystal along the optic axis, or of a cubic\r\nsingly refractive crystal, the crystal being doubly refractive along all\r\nthree axes.\r\n\r\nBut it is a remarkable fact, nevertheless, that there are two directions\r\nin such a crystal along which the latter is apparently singly\r\nrefractive, and these two directions are known as the “optic axes,” and\r\nthe crystals of the three systems of lower symmetry are consequently\r\nsaid to be “biaxial.” These two singular directions are symmetrical to\r\ntwo of the three rectangular axes of the ellipsoid, those corresponding\r\nto the extreme indices α and γ, in the plane containing which two axes\r\nthey lie, and they are perpendicular to the third β. For if we draw the\r\nellipse of which the minimum and maximum axes are represented in length\r\nby α and γ, there will obviously be four symmetrical positions on the\r\ncurve where a line drawn to the centre of the ellipse would be equal to\r\nthe intermediate value β. If we join opposite pairs of these four points\r\nby diameters (lines passing through the centre of the ellipse) we have\r\ntwo directions each of which, together with the perpendicular direction\r\nof the β axis, lies on a circular section of the ellipsoid, for all\r\nradii from the centre lying in each of these sections are alike equal to\r\nβ. Consequently, light transmitted along the two directions in the\r\ncrystal normal (perpendicular) to these two circular sections will\r\nsuffer no apparent double refraction, the refractive index being the\r\nsame, namely β, and the velocity of vibration equal in all directions in\r\nthe crystal parallel to the two circular sections. Hence, we have two\r\ndirections in biaxial crystals in which the optical properties are\r\nsimilar to those of uniaxial crystals along their singular optic axis.\r\nBut the optical properties along the two optic axes of a biaxial crystal\r\nare advisedly stated to be “similar” to, and not “identical” with those\r\nalong the optic axis of a uniaxial crystal; for although they are\r\nidentical to all ordinary experimental tests, they are not quite so when\r\nwe come to ultimate details, which, however, are beyond the purview of\r\nthis book, but an account of which will be found in the author’s\r\n“Crystallography and Practical Crystal Measurement” (Macmillan & Co.,\r\n1911).\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 71.—Projection Polariscope arranged for Convergent Light.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWith these prefatory theoretical remarks, which are necessary in order\r\nthat the experiments now to be described should be understood, we may\r\nproceed to consider a graduated series of experimental demonstrations\r\nwhich it is hoped will render clear some of the more important features\r\nof crystal structure which have been dealt with in previous chapters.\r\nOur principal agent will be polarised light, that is, light which has\r\nbeen reduced to vibration in a single plane by means of the well-known\r\nNicol’s prism. This latter is a rhomb of calcite which has been cut in\r\ntwo parts along a specific diagonal direction, and the two parts of\r\nwhich have been re-cemented together with Canada balsam, in such a\r\nmanner that one of the two rays, known as the “ordinary” and which\r\ncorresponds to the ω refractive index, into which the doubly refracting\r\ncalcite crystal divides the ordinary light which it receives from the\r\nlantern or other source of light, is totally reflected at the layer of\r\nbalsam, while the other ray, known as the “extraordinary” and\r\ncorresponding to a refractive index of intermediate value between ω and\r\nε, and composed of vibrations at right angles to those of the totally\r\nreflected ray, is alone transmitted, as a ray of plane polarised light.\r\n\r\nWe employ a pair of such Nicol prisms (a very large pair being shown in\r\nFig. 71), together with a convenient system of lenses for focussing\r\neither the object-crystal or the phenomena displayed by it, as a\r\n“polariscope,” which is the most powerful weapon of optical research on\r\ncrystals which has ever been invented. When the two prisms are arranged\r\nso that the vibration planes of the polarised light which they would\r\nsingly transmit are parallel, we speak of them as “parallel Nicols,” and\r\nlight is transmitted unimpeded through the pair thus placed in\r\nsuccession; but when one of them is rotated the light diminishes, until\r\nwhen the vibration planes are at right angles no light escapes at all if\r\nthe Nicols are properly constructed, there being produced what is known\r\nas the “dark field” of the “crossed Nicols.” For the plane polarised\r\nlight reaching the analyser from the polariser cannot get through the\r\nformer, its plane of possible light vibration being perpendicular to\r\nthat of the already polarised beam.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena exhibited by crystals in polarised light are of two kinds,\r\nnamely, those observed when a parallel (cylindrical) beam of fight is\r\npassed through the crystal, and those exhibited when a converging\r\n(conical) beam of fight is employed and concentrated on the crystal, the\r\ncentre of which should occupy the apex of the cone. The disposition of\r\napparatus in the former case of parallel light will be described in the\r\nnext chapter and illustrated in Fig. 79. The arrangement for convergent\r\nlight, as employed for projections on the screen, has already been\r\nreferred to in connection with the Mitscherlich experiment with gypsum,\r\nand illustrated in Fig. 51 (page 92). The arrangement is shown again\r\nhere for convenience, in Fig. 71. The parts of the apparatus are briefly\r\nas follows: (1) the electric lantern with self-adjusting Brockie-Pell or\r\nOliver arc lamp and a 4½ or 5–inch set of condensers; (2) the water\r\ncell; (3) the polarising Nicol with a parallelising concave lens at its\r\ndivided-circle end; (4) a condensing lens; (5) the convergent system of\r\nthree lenses closely mounted in succession; (6) the crystal; (7) the\r\ncollecting system of three lenses equal and similar to the convergent\r\nsystem; (8) the field lens; (9) the projection lens; and (10) the\r\nanalysing Nicol. The ten parts are separately mounted in the author’s\r\napparatus, which confers greater freedom in experimenting and more power\r\nof varying the conditions; the converging and collecting lens systems,\r\nhowever, are mounted in a separately adjustable manner on a common\r\nstandard, which carries in the centre complete goniometrical adjustments\r\nfor the crystal.\r\n\r\nWhen we place on the stage of the polariscope, the Nicols being crossed,\r\na plate of a uniaxial crystal cut perpendicularly to the optic axis, and\r\nsubsequently a similar plate of a biaxial crystal cut perpendicularly to\r\nthat axis of the optical ellipsoid, either α or γ, which is the\r\nbisectrix of the acute angle between the two optic axes, and use the\r\nsystem of lenses which converges the light rays received from the\r\npolarising Nicol prism on the crystal, as shown in Fig. 71, we observe\r\nin the two cases quite different and very beautiful interference\r\nphenomena, which at once distinguish a uniaxial from a biaxial crystal.\r\nThe two appearances are illustrated in Plate XIV., by Figs. 72, 73, and\r\n74, which are reproductions of the author’s direct photographs. Fig. 72\r\nshows the interference figure afforded by uniaxial calcite, which is the\r\nsame for all positions of the crystal plate when rotated in its own\r\nplane by the rotation of the stage. Figs. 73 and 74 represent the\r\ninterference figures given by biaxial aragonite, the orthorhombic form\r\nof carbonate of lime, calcite and aragonite being the two forms of this\r\nsubstance, which has been shown in Chapter VII. to be dimorphous. The\r\neffect shown in Fig. 73 is afforded when the line joining the two optic\r\naxes is parallel to the plane of vibration of either of the crossed\r\nNicols, and the interference figure represented in Fig. 74 is given when\r\nthe stage and crystal (or the two Nicols simultaneously) are rotated\r\n45°.\r\n\r\nThe uniaxial calcite figure (Fig. 72) consists of circular\r\nspectrum-coloured rings resembling the well-known Newton’s rings, but\r\nwith a dark cross, fairly sharp near the centre but shading off towards\r\nthe margin of the field, marking the directions of the vibration planes\r\nof the Nicols.\r\n\r\nThe biaxial aragonite figures (Figs. 73 and 74) show two series of rings\r\nsurrounding the two optic axes and thus locating the positions of their\r\nemergence, equidistant from the centre of the field, where the bisectrix\r\nemerges. They are not circular, but are curves known as lemniscates,\r\nwhich are complete rings nearest to the two optic axes, but soon pass\r\ninto figure-of-eight loops, and eventually into ellipse-like lemniscates\r\nenveloping both optic axes, and more and more approaching circles in\r\ntheir curvature as the margin of the field is approached. Moreover, when\r\nthe direction of the fine joining the two optic axes is parallel to the\r\nvibration plane of either of the Nicols, as was the case when Fig. 73\r\nwas produced and photographed, a black rectangular cross is seen, one\r\nbar, which is much the sharper one, passing through the optic axes and\r\nthe other lying between them at right angles to the first bar, the\r\ncentre of the cross being in the middle of the field.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XIV._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 72.—Crystal Plate cut perpendicularly to the Axis.\r\n\r\n  Uniaxial Interference Figure afforded by Calcite (Trigonal) in\r\n    Convergent Polarized Light, with Crossed Nicols.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 73.—Crystal Plate cut perpendicularly to the Bisectrix of the\r\n    Acute Optic Axial Angle.\r\n\r\n  Biaxial Interference Figure afforded by Aragonite (Rhombic) in\r\n    Convergent Polarised Light, with Nicols crossed and parallel to the\r\n    Vibration Directions of the Crystal.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 74.—The same Plate as for the previous Figure.\r\n\r\n  The same when the two Nicols have been rotated in the same direction\r\n    for 45°, still remaining crossed.\r\n\r\n  CHARACTERISTIC UNIAXIAL AND BIAXIAL INTERFERENCE FIGURES IN CONVERGENT\r\n    POLARISED LIGHT.\r\n\r\n  (Reproductions of direct Photographs by the author.)\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn rotating the crystal plate in its own plane, while no change occurs\r\nwith the calcite, the aragonite figure changes as regards the black\r\ncross, which breaks up into hyperbolic curves currently spoken of as\r\n“brushes,” until when the plate has been rotated 45° the appearance is\r\nthat shown in Fig. 74, the eye being supposed to have followed the\r\nrotation. Or, keeping the eye still, the effect shown in Fig. 74 is\r\nequally produced by the simultaneous rotation of both Nicols for 45°.\r\nThe vertices of the hyperbolæ now mark the positions of the optic axes,\r\nand the angle between them is the apparent angle of the optic axes as\r\nseen in air, which is considerably different from the true angle between\r\nthe optic axes within the crystal, owing to the very different\r\nrefraction of light in air and in the crystal substance.\r\n\r\nNow some crystals exhibit a very different optic axial angle at\r\ndifferent temperatures, and one of the most beautiful experiments which\r\nhave ever been performed is the Mitscherlich experiment with gypsum,\r\nwhich has already been described in Chapter VII. in connection with the\r\nwork of Mitscherlich, and illustrated in Plate XII., Figs. 52 to 55.\r\nOther substances, on the other hand, show a marked change of optic axial\r\nangle as the wave-length of the light is changed, and such a case has\r\nalready been described in Chapter VIII. and illustrated in Plate XIII.,\r\nFig. 58. The figure afforded by such a substance in ordinary white light\r\nis, however, a complicated one, quite different from the normal one of\r\nFig. 73 afforded by aragonite, as will be clear on reference to the\r\ninterference figure shown at _f_ in Fig. 58, which represents the figure\r\ngiven by ethyl triphenyl pyrrholone in white light.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand such biaxial interference figures thoroughly,\r\nthey should be studied in monochromatic light, when one obtains a clear\r\nand sharp figure consisting of black curves as well as the cross or\r\nbrushes, and very sharp vertices to the brushes when the crystal is\r\narranged as in Fig. 74. The optic axial angle can then be measured for\r\neach important wave-length of light in turn, and the variation for\r\nwave-length followed throughout the whole spectrum. For this purpose it\r\nis very convenient to have a source of monochromatic light of any or\r\nevery wave-length always at hand, and the author some years ago devised\r\na spectroscopic monochromatic illuminator,[17] for use with any\r\nobserving instrument, and which is particularly convenient for use with\r\nthe polariscopical goniometer which is employed in practice for the\r\nmeasurement of optic axial angles. It is shown, along with the latter\r\ninstrument, in Fig. 75. The spectroscope has a single but very large\r\nprism of heavy but colourless flint glass, and the spectrum produced—the\r\nelectric lantern being the source of light, its rays being concentrated\r\non the slit—is filtered through a second slit at the other end of the\r\nspectroscope, where the detachable eyepiece is situated when the\r\ninstrument is used as an ordinary spectroscope, and for the calibration\r\n(with the Fraunhofer solar lines) of the circle on which the prism is\r\nmounted. The escaping narrow slit of monochromatic light includes only\r\nthe 250th part of the spectrum, so is monochromatic in a high sense of\r\nthe word. It impinges on a little ground glass diffuser carried in a\r\nvery short tube in front of this exit slit, and the optic axial angle\r\npolariscope is brought up almost into contact with the ground glass, and\r\nis thus supplied with an even field of pure monochromatic light. With\r\nthis apparatus it is easy to observe the exact crossing wave-length in\r\nall cases of crossed-axial-plane dispersion such as that illustrated in\r\nFig. 58; for the reading of the graduated circle on which the prism is\r\nmounted, and which is rotated in order to cause monochromatic light of\r\nthe different wave-lengths in turn to stream through the exit slit,\r\naffords the exact wave-length with the aid of the calibration curve once\r\nfor all prepared. This calibration of the graduations is readily carried\r\nout by using sunlight, and determining the readings corresponding to the\r\nadjustment of the principal Fraunhofer lines in the middle of the exit\r\nslit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 75.—Optic Axial Angle Goniometer and Spectroscopic Monochromatic\r\n    Illuminator.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHaving thus rendered clear the nature of ordinary interference figures\r\nafforded by crystals of the two types, uniaxial and biaxial, in\r\nconvergent polarised light, we may pass on to see what happens when we\r\ntake a number of plates of quartz of different thicknesses, cut\r\nperpendicularly to the optic axis in all cases, instead of a plate of\r\ncalcite. We will examine first a fine pair of hexagonal quartz plates so\r\ncut, each 1 millimetre thick exactly, and about 2 inches in diameter.\r\nOne was cut from a right-handed hexagonal prism, and the other from a\r\nsimilar left-handed one.\r\n\r\nEmploying the lantern projection polariscope shown in Fig. 71, arranged\r\nfor convergent light just as for the Mitscherlich experiment, and with\r\nthe Nicols crossed, we will now see what happens when each of these\r\nplates in turn is placed at the focus of the light rays, between the two\r\nconvergent systems of lenses. On the screen we observe in each case a\r\nsomewhat similar interference figure to that given by calcite, a black\r\ncross and rainbow coloured circular rings, the smallest ring, however,\r\nbeing very large relatively to the innermost ring given by calcite, and\r\nthe other rings being also further separated from each other. Moreover,\r\nthe black cross appears broadened out, this spreading of both rings and\r\ncross being due to the thinness of the plate combined with the low\r\ndouble refraction of quartz. Further, the right-handed and left-handed\r\nplates both afford apparently identical figures. In order to obtain a\r\nsharp figure like that of calcite we require to add a fourth lens, kept\r\nin reserve for such cases, to each of the two similar convergent lens\r\nsystems, one on each side of the crystal plate, in order to increase the\r\nconvergence of the light rays. The figure then obtained with one of the\r\ntwo plates is reproduced in Fig. 76, Plate XV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XV._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 76.\r\n\r\n  Interference Figure afforded by a Quartz Plate, 1 Millimetre thick, in\r\n    strongly Convergent Polarised Light.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 77.\r\n\r\n  Interference Figure afforded by a Quartz Plate, 3·75 Millimetres\r\n    thick, in moderately Convergent Polarised Light.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 78.\r\n\r\n  Interference Figure (Airy’s Spirals) afforded by two superposed Quartz\r\n    Plates, 3·75 Millimetres thick, one of Right-handed Quartz and the\r\n    other of Left-handed Quartz, in moderately Convergent Polarised\r\n    Light.\r\n\r\n  INTERFERENCE FIGURES IN CONVERGENT POLARISED LIGHT AFFORDED BY QUARTZ\r\n    PLATES CUT PERPENDICULARLY TO THE AXIS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLet us now observe, however, what occurs when a thicker plate of quartz\r\nis used. Taking one of 7.5 mm. thickness, and placing it in the focus of\r\nthe converging rays, after removing the two extra lenses, we see on the\r\nscreen quite a different effect, an attempt to reproduce which\r\nphotographically in black and white is made in Fig. 77 on the same Plate\r\nXV. The rings are closer together (using the same degree of\r\nconvergence), and the innermost is smaller; moreover, within it all\r\nsigns of the central part of the black cross have disappeared, and\r\ninstead a brilliant violet colour is shown, which alters to bright red\r\nof the first order spectrum with the least rotation of the analysing\r\nNicol in one direction from its crossed position with respect to the\r\npolarising Nicol, while if the rotation be in the opposite direction the\r\ndeep blue of Newton’s second order is produced. The arms of the cross,\r\nhowever, appear towards the margin of the field. The violet colour shown\r\nfor the exact position of crossing of the Nicols is the tint of passage\r\nbetween the first and second orders of Newton’s spectra, and this\r\nillumination of the central part of the interference figure is obviously\r\nthe effect of the optical activity of quartz, for the tint is the same\r\nas is produced with the plate in ordinary parallel plane polarised\r\nfight, and is, in fact, due to the central axial rays of the convergent\r\ncone being practically parallel.\r\n\r\nOn rotating the analysing Nicol for a few more degrees to the right we\r\nobserve that the innermost ring widens out and that the red passes into\r\norange and yellow, the quartz plate being a right-handed one. But when a\r\nsimilar plate cut from a left-handed quartz crystal is used instead, the\r\ninner ring closes up somewhat for the same rotation of the analyser,\r\nmoving inwards instead of outwards, and the blue colour given with the\r\nfirst slight rotation passes into green and yellow as the rotation is\r\ncontinued. Moreover, the circular character of the rings is altered, and\r\nso much so that when the rotation has proceeded as far as 45° the shape\r\nof the rings has changed almost to a square. These alterations in the\r\ninterference figure are characteristic of the two varieties of quartz\r\ncrystals. A useful rule to remember is, that for a right-handed crystal\r\nrotation of the analyser to the right causes the colours to appear in\r\nthe order of their refrangibility, namely, the least refrangible red\r\nfirst, then orange, yellow, green, blue and violet in their order; while\r\nfor a left-handed crystal the converse is true when the direction of\r\nrotation of the analyser is the same, that is, to the right, clockwise;\r\nobviously also the colours appear in the opposite order when the\r\nrotation of the analyser is to the left.\r\n\r\nIt will now prove of interest to examine the effects produced by two\r\nplates of opposite varieties of quartz of half this thickness, namely,\r\n3.75 mm. The phenomena are very similar to those just described, but the\r\nrings are a little wider, and the larger area within the innermost ring\r\nis now filled with yellow light instead of violet, when the analyser is\r\nexactly crossed to the polariser. It passes into a bright green when the\r\nanalyser is rotated slightly on one side, and into orange when the Nicol\r\nis rotated in the reverse direction. But the most interesting thing of\r\nall is to observe what occurs when these two plates of 3.75 mm.\r\nthickness, one of right-handed quartz and the other of left-handed, are\r\nsuperposed and placed in contact together as one plate, of double the\r\nthickness, 7.5 mm., at the convergent focus. A beautiful spiral figure\r\nis produced on the screen, composed of the celebrated “Airy’s spirals”\r\nas if the black cross were being reproduced in the central part, but\r\nwith each of its bars distorted into the shape of the letter S, as shown\r\nin Fig. 78 at the foot of Plate XV. The contrary effects of the two\r\nopposing rotations are thus extraordinarily indicated visually in the\r\ninterference figure afforded by the composite plate.\r\n\r\nNow, it is of great practical interest that certain quartz crystals are\r\nfound in nature which show Airy’s spirals directly, on cutting a plate\r\n7.5 mm. thick or thereabouts, perpendicular to the optic axis. For\r\ninstance, one in the author’s collection of quartzes, a single plate of\r\nan apparently homogeneous and perfectly limpid crystal, shows the\r\nspirals exceedingly well and clearly defined. As a matter of fact, it is\r\na twin, a right and a left-handed crystal being twinned together with an\r\ninvisible plane of composition, which is only revealed on examining the\r\ncrystal in polarised light, as will be demonstrated in the next chapter\r\nby the use of parallel polarised light. The fact of such a plate of\r\nquartz affording Airy’s spirals in convergent polarised light is,\r\nhowever, of itself an excellent proof of the twinning of two crystal\r\nindividuals of the opposite varieties.\r\n\r\nNow the very shape of these spiral figures suggests screw action of the\r\nmolecular structure of the crystals on the waves of light passing\r\nthrough them, and moreover, of the action of two screws of opposite\r\ndirections of winding, one clockwise and the other anti-clockwise, thus\r\nremarkably confirming the supposition that the point-systems of the\r\nstructure of the right and left-handed varieties of quartz are of a\r\nhelical nature and respectively of opposite modes of winding.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment, devised by Reusch, which still further enhances the\r\nprobability that this supposition as to the structure of quartz crystals\r\nis correct, may next be introduced. A thin film of biaxial mica has been\r\ncut into twenty-four narrow strips, which have been laid over each other\r\nat angles of 60°, so that a screw-shaped pile has been formed of the\r\ncentral overlapping parts, consisting of four complete rotations; that\r\nis, there are four repetitions of the “pitch” of the screw, each\r\ncomposed of six films. On placing this composite plate of mica at the\r\nconvergent focus of the lantern polariscope, so that the overhanging\r\nends of any four identically superposed strips occupy the focus, the\r\nordinary biaxial interference figure of mica—two sets of rings and\r\nhyperbolic brushes, very much like Fig. 52, Plate XII.—is observed on\r\nthe screen. But when the plate is moved so that the central part comes\r\ninto the focus, where all the twenty-four films overlap in their six\r\ndifferent orientations 60° apart, and so that all the light rays have to\r\ntraverse the whole helical pile of the twenty-four films, a uniaxial\r\nfigure exactly like that of quartz is produced, namely, one composed of\r\ncircular rings, with a black cross only visible, however, at the\r\nmarginal part, and with the inner ring filled with brightly coloured\r\nlight. Moreover, on slightly rotating the analysing Nicol the innermost\r\nring moves outwards or inwards and the colour changes to blue or red,\r\naccording to the direction in which the helix had been wound, in exact\r\naccordance with the rule stated above for quartz.\r\n\r\nIf now a second such helical pile of mica films, but one for which the\r\nopposite manner of winding has been adopted, anti-clockwise if the first\r\nhad been clockwise, be examined at the convergent focus, precisely the\r\nsame appearance will be observed with crossed Nicols, but the opposite\r\nchanges will occur on rotating the analyser. Finally, to complete the\r\ninteresting proof of the helical nature of quartz crystals, when these\r\ntwo oppositely wound composite mica plates are superposed—each being\r\nmarked carefully to indicate the direction of the helix and the proper\r\nmode of superposition in order to effect precise oppositeness of\r\narrangement, mirror-image symmetry, in fact, about the plane of\r\ncontact—and placed in the convergent beam near its focus, there is at\r\nonce seen on the screen a magnificent display of Airy’s spirals, as\r\nperfect as those afforded by the fine natural twin last experimented\r\nwith. Hence, there can be no doubt whatever that the remarkable optical\r\nbehaviour of quartz is due to its point-system being of a helical\r\nnature, a right or a left-handed screw structure being apparently\r\nproduced in nature with equal facility. The circumstances of environment\r\nduring the formation of the crystal probably determine which variety\r\nshall be produced, and when the nature of the environment becomes\r\nchanged during the operation of formation either twins are produced of\r\nthe two varieties, or separate individual crystals.\r\n\r\nThis may well conclude our experiments in convergent polarised light,\r\nwhich—including the beautiful Mitscherlich experiment described in\r\nChapter VII., of exhibiting the crossing of the optic axial plane in the\r\ncase of gypsum, and the production of all the types of interference\r\nfigures in succession, as the crystal becomes warmed by the heat rays\r\naccompanying the beam of convergent light—will have introduced the\r\nreader to a typical series of such experiments, and such as were\r\nactually exhibited by the author to the British Association at Winnipeg.\r\nWe may pass, therefore, in the next chapter to the consideration of an\r\nequally interesting series in which a parallel beam of polarised light\r\nwill be used, which will still further elucidate the internal structure\r\nin the especially instructive case of quartz crystals, and that of\r\ncrystals in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\nEXPERIMENTS WITH QUARTZ AND GYPSUM IN PARALLEL POLARISED LIGHT. GENERAL\r\n             CONCLUSIONS FROM THE EXPERIMENTS WITH QUARTZ.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to rearrange the projection polariscope for experiments in\r\nparallel light, we simply remove the three lenses on separate stands\r\n(Fig. 71), and the convergent systems of lenses on their special\r\nadjustable stand with goniometrical crystal holder, from between the two\r\nNicol prisms, and replace them by two other separately mounted lenses,\r\nacting together as an achromatic projecting objective, and a rotatable\r\nobject stage. The whole arrangement as thus altered for experiments in\r\nparallel polarised light is shown in position in Fig. 79. The change is\r\nreadily made, a gap in the plinth-bed guides near the analysing Nicol\r\nenabling it to be effected without removing either of the prisms, the\r\nanalyser being simply drawn along a few inches nearer the end in order\r\nto expose the changing gap. The pair of lenses consists of a\r\nplano-convex lens of 5 inches focus and 2¼ inches diameter, and another\r\nplano-convex lens of 8½ inches focus and 2 inches aperture, with their\r\nconvex faces turned towards each other. Together they produce on the\r\nscreen an excellent image of the object on the stage, and the size of\r\nthe image can be varied at will by regulating the relative positions of\r\nthe two lenses with respect to each other and to the object stage. If\r\nfound more suitable for the particular screen distance available, the\r\n5–inch lens may be replaced by a 6–inch lens also provided as an\r\nalternative.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 79.—Projection Polariscope arranged for Parallel Light.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the analysing Nicol is arranged with its vibration direction\r\nparallel to that of the polariser, we obtain bright light on the screen\r\non actuating the electric lantern, and the image of an object on the\r\nstage can thus be projected on the screen on a bright ground. But when\r\nthe analyser is crossed to the polariser, that is, rotated to the\r\nposition 90° from this parallel position, the two planes of vibration of\r\nthe Nicols being then at right angles, the screen is quite dark. Before\r\ncontinuing in this dark field our experimental study of quartz, which is\r\nobviously a type of the more exceptionally behaving substances owing to\r\nits special structure, it will be wise to examine a more ordinary kind\r\nof crystalline substance. For this purpose gypsum—better known in\r\noptical work as selenite, hydrated sulphate of lime, CaSO_{4}.2H_{2}O,\r\ncrystallising in beautifully transparent and often large crystals\r\nbelonging to the monoclinic system, a typical one of which has been\r\nillustrated in Fig. 9 (page 14), and which we have already referred to\r\nin connection with the Mitscherlich experiment described in Chapter\r\nVII.—is especially suitable, on account of its clear and colourless\r\ntransparency, the large size of crystals available, and the brilliancy\r\nof the polarisation colours which they afford when adequately thin. A\r\nvery perfect cleavage being developed parallel to the symmetry plane,\r\nthe clinopinakoid {010}, such thin films, of even thickness throughout,\r\ncan be readily prepared.\r\n\r\nSuch a very thin cleavage plate, about 1½ inches in its longest\r\ndimension, is mounted with Canada balsam between a pair of circular\r\nglass plates 1⅞ inches in diameter, the standard size of object plates\r\nfor the projection polariscope; the double plate is then supported in a\r\nmahogany frame also of the standard size—4 by 2¼ inches, with clear\r\naperture of 1⅝ inches diameter and supporting rabbet for the plate 1⅞ to\r\n2 inches diameter—on the rotating stage by a pair of spring clips. The\r\nNicols being arranged with their vibration directions parallel, in order\r\nto permit light to travel to the screen, and the lenses being arranged\r\nproperly for a sharply focussed picture of suitable size, the outline of\r\nthe crystal plate will be seen on the screen, and the whole area of the\r\ncrystal will either at once appear coloured, or will do so on more or\r\nless rotation of the stage carrying the crystal, which rotates the\r\nlatter in its own plane. The crystal outline is of the character shown\r\nin Fig. 80, which also gives the positions of the crystal axes a and c,\r\nand a simple stereographic projection of the faces of the crystal, from\r\nwhich the nature of the faces bounding the section-plate will be clear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 80.—Section of Gypsum Crystal showing the Extinction Directions.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn rotating the Nicol analyser the colours change, and appear at their\r\nmaximum brilliancy when the field is dark and the Nicols crossed.\r\nLeaving the analyser crossed to the polariser, and rotating the stage\r\nand therefore the crystal, the colours again change, and at certain\r\npositions 90° apart during the rotation, marked by the two strong lines\r\nin Fig. 80, they disappear altogether, and the crystal becomes dark like\r\nthe rest of the field, while the positions of maximum brilliancy of\r\ncolour are found to be situated at the 45°-positions intermediate\r\nbetween these positions of “extinction.” When the quenching occurs the\r\nvibration planes of the two rays, travelling by virtue of double\r\nrefraction through the crystal, are parallel to the planes of vibration\r\nof the rays transmitted through the two Nicols, and the fact is a very\r\nimportant one, enabling us to determine the directions of light\r\nvibration in the crystal. In the case of our gypsum plate, the cleavage\r\nof gypsum being parallel to the unique plane of symmetry of the\r\nmonoclinic crystal, these two positions are the directions of the two\r\naxes of the optical ellipsoid which lie in the symmetry plane, and they\r\ncorrespond to the vibration directions of rays affording the refractive\r\nindices α and γ. The direction corresponding to γ is that of the “first\r\nmedian line,” the bisectrix of the acute angle between the optic axes;\r\nwhile α corresponds to the obtuse bisectrix or “second median line.”\r\nThese directions are clearly marked by the strong lines in Fig. 80. The\r\nthird axis of the optical ellipsoid is obviously perpendicular to the\r\nplate and to the symmetry plane, and corresponds to the intermediate\r\nrefractive index β. Thus this simple observation of the extinction\r\ndirections in such a case as gypsum enables us at once to fix completely\r\nthe orientation of the optical ellipsoid, a fundamental optical\r\ndetermination.\r\n\r\nA second thin plate of gypsum may next be examined, similarly prepared\r\nand mounted. It is clearly a composite one, being composed of a pair of\r\ntwins. For when placed on the stage in the dark field of the crossed\r\nNicols, and rotated to the position for maximum brilliancy of colour, it\r\nshows different colours in the two halves, as indicated by different\r\nshading in Fig. 81. If, however, the analysing Nicol prism be withdrawn\r\nfrom the plinth-bed and removed altogether the crystal appears in its\r\nnatural colourless condition as a single one, with no indication\r\nwhatever of any line of division.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 81.—Twin of Gypsum as seen in Parallel Polarised Light.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSome exceedingly brilliant polarisation effects are afforded by a number\r\nof objects exhibited by the author in his lecture at Winnipeg, composed\r\nof selenite (gypsum) twins and triplets, some arranged to cross one\r\nanother like the mica films of Reusch described in the last chapter, but\r\nonly for a single rotation, three twin strips going to a rotation, at\r\nangular distances of 120°; others are arranged in geometrical patterns,\r\nand in circles overlapping one another, and the whole series afford the\r\nmost gorgeous and variegated display of colour imaginable, the colours,\r\nmoreover, altering either on rotation of the stage or of the analysing\r\nNicol, and thus passing through every tint conceivable.\r\n\r\nHaving thus demonstrated the usual effect afforded by a doubly\r\nrefracting crystal plate in parallel polarised light, we may next\r\nillustrate two special cases, which will lead us up to the case of\r\nquartz once more. The first relates to a crystal belonging to the cubic\r\nsystem, which is theoretically singly refractive or “isotropic”; the\r\nsecond concerns a plate of a uniaxial crystal cut perpendicularly to the\r\noptic axis, the unique direction of single refraction of such a crystal.\r\nA plate of fluorspar affords a good example of the first case. When\r\nplaced on the stage of the polariscope it shows no colour at all in\r\npolarised light, whatever be the position of the two Nicols with respect\r\nto each other, and the field remains dark when they are crossed, the\r\ncrystal, in fact, behaving just like so much glass.\r\n\r\nA word of caution, however, is here necessary, for natural mineral\r\ncrystals are not infrequently formed under conditions of considerable\r\nstrain, at high temperatures or under great pressure, as in the case of\r\nthe diamond for instance. So that we must be careful to choose a normal\r\nand well-formed crystal of fluorspar for our experiment. This point may\r\nbe well illustrated by placing on the stage a thick circular plate of\r\nglass, an inch or more in diameter, which has been purposely heated and\r\nthen suddenly cooled in order to evoke such a condition of strain.\r\nCrossing the Nicols so as to obtain the dark field, there is at once\r\nproduced on the screen a black cross and circular concentric\r\nspectrum-coloured rings, resembling with wonderful simulation the\r\ninterference figure, shown in Fig. 72, Plate XIV., afforded by calcite\r\nor other uniaxial crystal in convergent polarised light. Artificial\r\ndouble refraction has been produced in the glass by the strained\r\nconditions, in a fashion concentrically symmetrical to the axis of the\r\ncylinder, an interference figure being afforded symmetrical about the\r\naxis of the cylinder as if it were an optic axis.\r\n\r\nThe diamond crystallises in the cubic system, in octahedra, hexakis\r\noctahedra, or hexakis tetrahedra, and should, therefore, theoretically\r\nbe without effect on polarised light. Yet it is rare to find a diamond\r\nwhich does not show more or less colour in the dark field, owing to the\r\ncondition of strain in which it exists. It is notorious that the strain\r\nis occasionally so great that a diamond explodes into powder shortly\r\nafter removal from its enveloping matrix of blue clay. The author, by\r\nthe great kindness of Sir William Crookes, was enabled to show on the\r\nscreen, both in a lecture at the Royal Society and in the Evening\r\nDiscourse to the British Association at Winnipeg, the images of ten\r\nmagnificent large diamonds, natural, perfectly formed crystals uncut and\r\nunspoilt by the lapidary. They were mounted between two circular glass\r\nplates of the usual 1⅞ inches diameter, the diamonds being attached by\r\nbalsam to one of them; each plate was held in a mahogany frame of 1⅝\r\ninches circular aperture, the two frames being then attached face to\r\nface to form a single one, an enclosing cell, which could be placed on\r\nthe rotating stage as an object-slide for the projection polariscope.\r\nThe appearance of the diamonds on the screen in ordinary light is\r\nreproduced in Fig. 82, Plate XVI., as well as is possible without their\r\nnatural colour, for while several of them are brilliantly colourless,\r\nothers are tinted, one being a bright green diamond. On producing the\r\ndark field by crossing the analysing Nicol with respect to the\r\npolariser, the darkness was dispelled by brilliant polarisation colours,\r\nat once revealing the diamonds and outlining them clearly against the\r\ndark background. On rotating the analyser the colours changed in the\r\nusual manner of polarising objects, and bright colours were shown by all\r\nthe diamonds even when the Nicols were parallel.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious, then, that both a transparent non-crystalline substance\r\nsuch as glass, and a cubic crystal, must be free from strain in order\r\nthat it shall exhibit no colour in polarised light and, indeed, no\r\npolarisation effects whatever, and behave as an isotropic substance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XVI._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 82.—Ten Diamonds exhibiting Natural Faces, mounted for the\r\n    Lantern Polariscope, to show Polarisation Colours due to Internal\r\n    Strain.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 121.—Doubly Refracting Liquid Crystals of Cholesteryl Acetate,\r\n    projected on the Screen in the Act of Growth (see p. 281).\r\n\r\n  TWO FIGURES ILLUSTRATING THE HARDEST (DIAMOND) AND THE SOFTEST (LIQUID\r\n    CRYSTALS) OF CRYSTALS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe second special case to which attention may be called, that of a\r\nplate of an ordinary uniaxial crystal such as calcite, cut\r\nperpendicularly to the optic axis, is also obviously subject to the same\r\nproviso, that the crystal must be free from strain in order to exhibit\r\nthe normal phenomena. Such a perfectly normal plate remains quite\r\nobscure in the dark field in parallel light, producing neither colour\r\nnor interference figure, even on rotation of the object stage with the\r\ncrystal, in its own plane. For the light traverses the crystal along the\r\noptic axis, the axis of single refraction, and the vibrations occur with\r\nequal velocity in all directions perpendicular to it. Hence there is no\r\ndivision into two rays, one retarded behind the other on account of less\r\nvelocity of vibration, and therefore no interference colour.\r\n\r\nAnd now this leads us back to quartz, for this mineral is also uniaxial,\r\nand we will investigate in the same manner in parallel polarised light\r\nthe plates of the mineral cut perpendicularly to the optic axis, which\r\nhave already been referred to in connection with the experiments\r\nconcerning the interference figures produced in convergent polarised\r\nlight. Suppose we take first the large plate of quartz 7.5 mm. thick and\r\nover 2 inches in diameter. Placing it on the stage—instead of finding\r\nthe dark field to be unaffected by the introduction of the plate, and to\r\nremain so on rotation of the latter in its own plane, as should\r\ntheoretically be the case if quartz were a normal uniaxial crystal, and\r\nas calcite has been actually shown to do—we observe that it polarises in\r\nbrilliant colour, the whole hexagonal outline of the plate, clearly\r\nfocussed on the screen, being filled with an evenly brilliant violet\r\ntint, the tint of passage, just as the central part of the interference\r\nfigure, within the innermost ring, had been coloured in the convergent\r\nlight experiment with the same plate. The colour changes with the\r\nslightest rotation of either of the Nicols, passing into red for one\r\ndirection of rotation and into blue and green when the Nicol is rotated\r\nin the other direction. The tint also alters when the section-plate is\r\nrotated about its vertical diameter, by rotating the upper adjustable\r\npart of the supporting column of the stage within its outer fixed\r\ntubular column; this latter change is equivalent to a thickening of the\r\nplate, the light beam having to traverse a longer path through the\r\nquartz during such oblique setting of the plate.\r\n\r\nThis colour is due to the same fact which produced colour in the central\r\npart of the interference figure, namely, the optical activity of quartz,\r\nthe fact that the plane of vibration of a beam of plane polarised light\r\ntransmitted along the axis of quartz is rotated to the right hand or to\r\nthe left. The amount of this rotation is precisely equal, although\r\nopposite in direction, for the two varieties of quartz, but the rotation\r\nvaries very considerably for different rays of the spectrum. It also\r\nvaries directly proportionally to the thickness of the plate. A plate\r\none millimetre thick cut perpendicularly to the axis rotates the plane\r\nof polarisation for red hydrogen light (C of the spectrum) to the extent\r\nof 17° 19′, for yellow D sodium light 21° 42′, and for greenish-blue F\r\nhydrogen light 32° 46′. The rotation is a maximum for plates\r\nperpendicular to the axis, and the effect is inappreciable in directions\r\nat right angles thereto. It is clearly due to the oppositely spiral\r\nwinding of the regular-point-system of the crystal structure, round the\r\ndirection of the optic axis, the trigonal axis of symmetry of the\r\ncrystal, a structure which we have proved to be characteristic of quartz\r\nby the beautiful experiments with the helical piles of mica plates,\r\nabsolutely reproducing the polarisation effects with quartz, as\r\ndescribed in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe opposite optical rotation of the two varieties of quartz can be well\r\nshown by constructing a “biquartz.” Two plates of equal thickness,\r\npreferably either 7.5 mm. or 3.75 mm., are cut, one from a right-handed\r\nand the other from a left-handed crystal, each exactly perpendicular to\r\nthe optic axis. The two edge-surfaces to be subsequently joined together\r\nare also cut, ground and polished as true planes perpendicular to the\r\nplate surfaces, and the two plates are then cemented together with\r\nCanada balsam by these two prepared edge-surfaces, taking care that the\r\nbroad plate-surfaces of the two halves are absolutely continuous as if\r\nthe whole were a single parallel-surfaced plate of quartz. Such a\r\ncomposite plate or “biquartz,” is one of the most useful aids to the\r\nstudy of optical activity, being much used for enhancing the\r\nsensitiveness of the determination of the angle of rotation.\r\n\r\nWhen the image of such a 7.5 mm. biquartz, mounted in the usual mahogany\r\nframe and placed on the object stage of the projection polariscope, is\r\nthrown on the screen—the Nicols being crossed for production of the dark\r\nfield, and the stage and crystal plate being strictly perpendicular to\r\nthe parallel beam of polarised light—the whole of the screen covered by\r\nthe image of the plate appears uniformly coloured with the violet tint\r\nof passage. But the moment the analysing Nicol is rotated for a very few\r\ndegrees, one-half turns red and the other blue and then green. If the\r\nNicol be turned back again to the crossing position with the polariser,\r\nand then rotated further in the opposite direction to the former\r\nrotation, the appearances on the two sides of the sharply focussed fine\r\nline of demarcation between the two halves are inverted, the side which\r\nformerly turned red now becoming green, and _vice versa_. The two\r\nvarieties of quartz are thus oppositely affected, and it will be obvious\r\nthat the biquartz is a very delicate test for the exact crossing of a\r\npair of polarising prisms, or for the determination of the mutual\r\nextinction of two rectangularly polarised beams of light in general.\r\n\r\nA very striking and beautiful mode of exhibiting this opposite and equal\r\nrotation of the plane of polarisation by the two varieties of quartz may\r\nnext be described, an experiment which we owe to Prof. S. P. Thompson. A\r\ncomposite plate of mica is constructed out of 24 sectors of 15° angle\r\neach, the whole making up a complete circular plate. They are cemented\r\nbetween two circular glass plates of the usual 1⅞ inch size, with\r\nbalsam; the sectors are laid down in succession on one of the plates\r\nfirst, side by side, with the edge of every one in turn in close contact\r\nwith the edge of the next in order, so as to radiate from a common\r\ncentre. The second glass plate is only cemented after the arrangement\r\nhas been allowed to set for some days, when there is less risk of\r\ndisturbing the mounting of the sectors. The latter have all been cut\r\nfrom the same film of mica, which has a thickness corresponding to a\r\nretardation of one of the two rays produced by the double refraction of\r\nthe crystal behind the other equal to one and a half waves. Each sector\r\nis so cut that the line bisecting the 15° angle is parallel to the line\r\njoining the positions of emergence of the two optic axes of the crystal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 83.—A Disc _b_ of 24 Mica Sectors under Crossed Nicols, showing\r\n    Effects at _a_ and _c_ of Introduction of Left and Right-handed\r\n    Quartz Plates.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn placing this wheel of mica on the polariscope stage, the Nicols being\r\ncrossed, the effect shown at _b_ in Fig. 83 is observed on the screen.\r\nThe four sectors 90° apart, the bisecting lines of which are vertical\r\nand horizontal respectively, parallel to the vibration planes of the\r\nNicols, appear as a jet black cross; the sectors next to them appear\r\npale brown, and the next again a still paler delicate shade of sepia,\r\nwhile the central diagonal ones of each quadrant, at 45° to the black\r\ncross, are brilliantly white.\r\n\r\nOn now introducing behind or in front of the stage a right-handed quartz\r\nplate one millimetre thick, one of the pair of large ones described in\r\none of the convergent light experiments of the last chapter, the black\r\ncross is observed to be deflected one sector to the right, as shown at\r\n_c_ in Fig. 83; whereas when the left-handed companion plate is\r\nintroduced in like manner the cross moves over one sector to the left,\r\nas indicated at _a_ in Fig. 83. The two quartz plates are mounted on the\r\nsame mahogany object frame, a specially long one with two large\r\napertures carrying the quartzes, so that first one and then the other\r\ncan be placed in or out of position, and when this is done rapidly the\r\nmovement of the cross from right to left and back again is very marked.\r\n\r\nOccasionally a natural biquartz is obtained, on cutting a plate out of a\r\ncrystal of quartz perpendicularly to the axis. For it is not uncommon to\r\nfind a crystal which, while apparently a single crystal, is really a\r\ntwin, the two right and left individuals being joined by an invisible\r\nplane of contact, or “plane of composition” as it is called, so\r\nbeautifully have the two grown together. Figs. 84 and 85 show two kinds\r\nof twins of quartz. The former consists of two obviously different\r\nindividuals, with the little _s_ and _x_ faces indicating right or\r\nleft-handedness clearly developed in an opposite manner. The crystal\r\nshown in Fig. 85, however, appears to be a single individual, yet\r\ndiffers from either a right-handed or a left-handed crystal in showing\r\nthe _s_ and _x_ faces developed on both right and left solid angles. It\r\nis a case of complete interpenetration.\r\n\r\nIn both cases the plane of twinning is parallel to the optic axis, and\r\nto a pair of faces of the hexagonal prism of the second order,\r\nperpendicular to a pair of the actual first order prism faces shown by\r\nthe crystal. They are examples of the well-known “Brazilian twinning” of\r\nquartz, so called because many quartz crystals found in Brazil display\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 84.—Pair of Brazilian Twins of Quartz.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 85.—Completely Interpenetrated Brazilian Twins of Quartz.\r\n]\r\n\r\nA natural biquartz of 3.75 millimetres thickness cut from such a crystal\r\nas is shown in Fig. 85, the plate having a hexagonal outline just as if\r\nthe crystal were really a single one, may next be projected on the\r\nscreen. The Nicols being crossed, the outline of the crystal is seen\r\nsharply defined, the whole area of the crystal being coloured a uniform\r\nyellow, there being absolutely no trace of any dividing line. But the\r\nmoment one commences to turn the analysing Nicol different shades,\r\norange and green respectively, begin to develop on the two sides of the\r\nline indicating the plane of composition of the twin, the hexagon being\r\ndivided by a diametral line joining two corners, which have been\r\narranged in mounting the plate in its carrier frame to be above one\r\nanother, so as to bring the line of composition vertical, as will be\r\nclear from Fig. 86. On rotating the analyser further the difference is\r\nstill more marked, and we have blue on one side and orange red on the\r\nother, developing still deeper into red and purple as the analyser\r\napproaches the parallel position with respect to the polariser; when\r\nthis latter position is attained the transition violet tint is developed\r\nevenly over the whole plate, and the dividing line has again\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 86.—A Natural Biquartz in Parallel Polarised Light.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother natural biquartz, also shown in the author’s lecture at\r\nWinnipeg, introduces us to a new phenomenon. For when the Nicols are\r\ncrossed we observe a black band down the centre of the plate, marking\r\nthe line of division of the twins. When the analyser is rotated until it\r\nis parallel to the polariser this black band changes to a white one, the\r\nsequence of colours on the different sides of the band, that is, in each\r\nhalf of the plate, being the same as just described. The effect with\r\ncrossed Nicols is more or less simulated in Fig. 87, Plate XVII., which\r\nis a reproduction of a direct photograph of the screen picture. The\r\nreason for this black band in the dark field, and for the white one in\r\nthe bright field, is that the two halves of the twin overlap at the\r\ncentre, the plane of junction of the two individual crystals being\r\noblique to the plate, instead of exactly perpendicular thereto as was\r\nthe case with the first natural biquartz. We are, in fact, beginning to\r\nget the effect of two superposed wedges of quartz.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XVII._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 87.—Natural Biquartz exhibiting the Black Band (Nicols crossed)\r\n    at the Oblique Junction of the Right-handed and Left-handed Parts.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 88.—Artificial Biquartz, the two parts being obliquely joined in\r\n    order to produce the Black Band.\r\n\r\n  DIRECT PHOTOGRAPHS OF PICTURES PROJECTED ON THE SCREEN BY THE LANTERN\r\n    POLARISCOPE, USING PARALLEL LIGHT.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the obliquity is greater, or the crystal thicker, a white band\r\nappears on each side of the black central one, the Nicols being crossed,\r\nand when the thickness is as great as 6 to 7.5 mm. a spectrum band\r\nappears on each side of the white one.\r\n\r\nThat this obliquity of the surface of contact of the two intergrown\r\nindividuals (not the plane of twinning, which remains parallel to a pair\r\nof faces of the hexagonal prism of the second order) is the true\r\nexplanation can be readily proved by reproducing the effect\r\nartificially. A thick double plate of quartz is constructed, as shown in\r\nFig. 88, composed of two halves of respectively right-handed and\r\nleft-handed quartz, each 6 to 7 millimetres thick, and each of which has\r\nhad the edge-face of junction ground and polished obliquely at an angle\r\nof 30° or so, and oppositely so, instead of perpendicularly to the\r\nplates; the two halves are then cemented together in the usual manner\r\nfor a biquartz, with Canada balsam, in order to make a continuous plate.\r\nOn placing the plate of this construction possessed by the author on the\r\nstage of the projection polariscope, the two halves exhibit on the\r\nscreen respectively brilliant red and green colour, with a vertical\r\ncentral black band, and on each side of it first a white strip and then\r\na spectrum band, all the bands being parallel to each other, and the\r\nwhole effect being precisely what was observed with the thickest natural\r\nbiquartz.\r\n\r\nThus, we have imitated the oblique junction of the twin parts of the\r\nsecond and third biquartzes, and proved that this obliquity is the\r\nreason for the phenomena of bands, the black band occupying the centre\r\nwhere the two opposite rotations of the right and left quartz are\r\nprecisely neutralised. The dark field of the crossed Nicols consequently\r\nprevails along this central strip, for the rotatory effect of the first\r\nindividual crystal on the light passing through it is exactly undone by\r\nthe subsequent passage of the rays through the other individual. On\r\neither side of this neutral strip there is a little preponderance of\r\nright-handed quartz on one side, and of left-handed quartz on the other,\r\nand the usual effect of a thin plate of quartz is therefore seen,\r\nnamely, no colour but a little light, while further accretions of\r\nthickness of the preponderating variety give all the colours of the\r\nspectrum in turn, as with growing thicknesses of ordinary single quartz\r\nplates, thus producing the spectrum band.\r\n\r\nThe black band is also afforded when the plate is cut somewhat\r\nobliquely, out of a twin crystal with a junction plane truly\r\nperpendicular to the equatorial section, instead of cutting it truly\r\nperpendicularly to the axis, the junction plane being then oblique to\r\nthe plate. The polarisation colours are not so strong, however, unless\r\nthe plate be made thicker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XVIII._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 89.—Black Central Band and equidistant Spectrum Bands on each\r\n    side, afforded by Babinet’s Composite Plate of two Quartz Wedges,\r\n    one parallel and the other perpendicular to the Axis. (Direct\r\n    Photograph of Screen Picture as projected by Lantern Polariscope.)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 94.—Section-plate of Amethyst, natural size, as seen directly in\r\n    Ordinary Light, showing Alternate Violet Sectors (see p. 223).\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis effect of a black band with flanking spectra is very similar to\r\nthat obtained, due to double refraction and not to optical activity,\r\nwhen two thin wedges of quartz are cemented together to form a parallel\r\nplate, one wedge being cut so that the optic axis is parallel to the\r\nedge of the wedge, and the other with the optic axis perpendicular to\r\nthe edge. When such a composite plate of quartz, often known as a\r\nBabinet plate from the name of its first constructor, is placed on the\r\nstage of the polariscope, and rotated to the 45° position with respect\r\nto the planes of vibration of the crossed Nicols, there is observed on\r\nthe screen a deep black band in the centre parallel to the edge of the\r\nwedge, and a number of spectrum bands on each side, separated by white\r\nequal interspaces, the rainbow coloured bands showing the orders of\r\nNewton’s spectra. The effect, as seen on the screen, is reproduced\r\nphotographically in black and white in Fig. 89, Plate XVIII.\r\n\r\nThese experiments lead us naturally to the study of a great variety of\r\nquartz twins, involving some of the most beautiful and gorgeously\r\nchromatic phenomena which it is possible to produce on the screen with\r\nthe projection polariscope. They will eventually bring us to the study\r\nof amethyst quartz, in which the twinning is repeated so often that the\r\nlaminations of alternate right and left quartz are sometimes countless,\r\nand almost approach molecular dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe Brazilian twinning of quartz, parallel to a pair of faces of the\r\nsecond order hexagonal prism {11̄20}, often occurs in a very erratic\r\nmanner, as regards the arrangement of the portions of the composite\r\ncrystal belonging to the two varieties, the surfaces of contact and\r\ncharacter of the interpenetration being frequently very irregular, and\r\noften remarkably so. Thus Fig. 90, the upper figure of the coloured\r\nfrontispiece, gives some faint idea of the appearance presented on the\r\nscreen by a very beautiful quartz plate, one-half of which is entirely\r\ncomposed of left-handed quartz, giving a rich even rose-red colour when\r\nthe Nicols are crossed, not very far from the violet transition tint,\r\nthe plate being nearly 7.5 mm. thick, while the other half consists of\r\nan alternation of strips of right and left-handed quartz, joined\r\nobliquely to the surface of the plate, the black band and its\r\naccompanying white ones and spectrum bands being repeated two or three\r\ntimes before the edge is reached. This is a very instructive case, for\r\nit shows in this half of the plate, on a large scale, what occurs in\r\namethyst in a more minutely structural manner, the broad strips, the\r\nsections of plates upwards of a quarter of an inch thick, of alternating\r\ncharacter becoming in amethyst thin lines, the sections of laminæ or\r\nfilms of microscopic tenuity, their number being correspondingly\r\nenormously increased.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to state how this Fig. 90, and the lower Fig. 97\r\nof the frontispiece representing the projection on the screen of benzoic\r\nacid in the act of crystallisation, were produced. The pictures on the\r\nscreen were directly photographed on the latest Lumière autochrome\r\nplates, a transparency in the actual natural colours being thus obtained\r\nin each case. These transparent colour-photographs were then used as\r\noriginals wherewith to reproduce the effects on paper by the most recent\r\nimproved three-colour photographic process.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XIX._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 91.—Sectorial 60° or 120° Intrusive Twinning of Right and\r\n    Left-handed Quartz, showing Ribbons with Central Black Band where\r\n    Oblique Overlapping occurs.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 92.—Irregular Intrusive Twinning of Right and Left-handed Quartz.\r\n\r\n  DIRECT PHOTOGRAPHS OF REMARKABLE SCREEN PICTURES AFFORDED IN PARALLEL\r\n    POLARISED LIGHT BY SECTIONS OF TWINS OF RIGHT AND LEFT QUARTZ.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTwo other typical cases of irregular quartz twinning may also with\r\nadvantage be demonstrated. The first is a plate in which there are\r\nrepeated 60° V-shaped or 120° wedge-shaped intrusions of one variety\r\ninto a greater mass of the other variety. The border of the V or 120°\r\nwedge is composed of a ribbon, the outer edges of which are\r\nspectrum-coloured and the central line of which is formed by the deep\r\nblack band, which is separated on each side from the spectra by a white\r\nstrip. Some idea of the beauty of this quartz plate, which was\r\ngenerously lent to the author by Prof. S. P. Thompson, as projected on\r\nthe screen under crossed Nicols, may be gathered from Fig. 91, Plate\r\nXIX., the upper homogeneous part of the plate being coloured a brilliant\r\ngreen, and the lower part red.\r\n\r\nThe second is an irregular interpenetration of one variety into the\r\nother, in repeated V-shapes occupying the lower half of the image of the\r\nplate as seen on the screen in the dark field of the projection\r\npolariscope, like a range of sharp mountain peaks, the black bands being\r\nso rapidly repeated as to be nearly continuous. These darker portions\r\nthus appear to form the bulk of the mountains, while the upper untwinned\r\nhalf of the crystal shows a clear and even sky blue; to make the\r\nresemblance to a range of Alpine mountains even more complete, the wavy\r\nline of demarcation between the twinned and non-twinned portions of the\r\nplate is bordered by a white ribbon, of varying width, giving the\r\nappearance of a snow-cap to each peak, which shows up clearly against\r\nthe blue sky. It will be obvious that this quartz plate affords an\r\naltogether very beautiful series of phenomena in parallel polarised\r\nlight on the screen, for the colours change with every movement of the\r\nanalysing Nicol from the crossed position, the appearance for which has\r\njust been described. Fig. 92, Plate XIX., gives only the faintest idea\r\nof the beauty of the screen picture afforded by this section-plate. The\r\neffect chosen as best for photographic reproduction purposes is one\r\nafforded when the analysing Nicol is rotated somewhat away from the\r\ncrossed position with respect to the polariser.\r\n\r\nAnd now we arrive finally at amethyst quartz, three very beautiful\r\nhexagonal plates of which—cut perpendicularly to the optic axis as usual\r\nfor quartzes intended to display optical activity, from an apparently\r\nsingle hexagonal prism in each case—will be taken as typifying the\r\nphenomena exhibited by this especially interesting variety of quartz on\r\nthe screen in parallel polarised light. The smaller one affords a screen\r\npicture, with Nicols not quite crossed, such as is portrayed in Fig. 93,\r\nPlate XX. We observe that the area of the hexagon is roughly divisible\r\ninto six 60°-sectors, and that alternate ones are uniformly coloured,\r\nindicating that they belong to wholly right-handed or left-handed\r\nquartz; whereas the other alternate sectors are most beautifully marked,\r\nas if by line shading parallel or inclined at 30° to the edges of the\r\nhexagon, by a considerable number of equally spaced dark or slate\r\ncoloured bands, close together but separated by white bands, with a\r\ntrace of spectrum colours along the middle of the latter. If we rotate\r\nthe analysing Nicol somewhat we can readily find a position, which is\r\nnot always that of crossed Nicols, for which these parallel bands of\r\nlaminar twinning are most clearly defined, as shown in the illustration,\r\nthe colours of the other sectors ever changing during the rotation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XX._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 93.—Section-plate of Amethyst Quartz, showing Sectorial Repeated\r\n    Twinning of the Right and Left Varieties.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 95.—Section-plate of large Amethyst Quartz Crystal, showing\r\n    relatively large Area of Sectorial Repeated Twinning of Right and\r\n    Left-handed Quartz (see p. 225).\r\n\r\n  DIRECT PHOTOGRAPHS OF SCREEN PICTURES OF AMETHYST PROJECTED BY THE\r\n    LANTERN POLARISCOPE IN PARALLEL LIGHT.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that we have here to do with the same phenomenon as was\r\nillustrated by the parallel bands shown on the large scale by the\r\nsection illustrated in Fig. 90 of the coloured frontispiece, the black,\r\nwhite, and spectrum-coloured bands being simply repeated very many more\r\ntimes in the same space, and in alternate sectors of the crystal.\r\n\r\nThe twinning of amethyst in 60°-sectors is very characteristic of this\r\nvariety of quartz, and it is an interesting fact that the sectors which\r\nshow the laminar bands in polarised light often appear purple coloured\r\nin ordinary light, the tint from which amethyst derives its name. This\r\nis not necessarily or always so however, and the section just described\r\nand illustrated in Fig. 93 appears quite colourless throughout on casual\r\ninspection in ordinary light, in fact as a clear colourless hexagonal\r\nsection of ordinary simple quartz; a trace of the amethyst colour\r\nbecomes, however, apparent on closer examination when held obliquely, in\r\nthe sectors where the bands become visible in polarised light.\r\n\r\nThe second plate of amethyst is a magnificent section 9 millimetres\r\nthick and 2½ inches in diameter, of which alternate 60°-sectors are\r\ndeeply amethyst coloured, the tint being a pure violet of about the\r\nwave-length of the hydrogen line near G of the spectrum. Moreover, even\r\nto the naked eye when the specimen is held in the hand up to the light,\r\nin certain positions the laminæ become visible as more deeply shaded\r\nviolet line markings. On placing it on the stage of the polariscope but\r\nwith the analysing Nicol removed, so as to observe the natural\r\nappearance of the section in white light (for, although polarised by the\r\npolarising Nicol, being unanalysed the section exhibits no polarisation\r\neffects), these facts become clear to everyone in the room. The violet\r\nstaining of alternate sectors appears very deep, and traces of\r\nlamination in the violet parts are just apparent on close scrutiny, the\r\nother alternate sectors appearing colourless and unmarked except by a\r\nfew flaws almost always present in so large a section-plate of amethyst.\r\nThe natural appearance of this plate is shown in Fig. 94, Plate XVIII.\r\n(facing page 218), as far as is possible photographically, the violet\r\nsectors being clearly demarcated.\r\n\r\nOn replacing the analysing Nicol the colourless sectors are seen to\r\npolarise uniformly in brilliant colours, indicating a homogeneous\r\nvariety of quartz in each, either right or left-handed. Moreover,\r\nwhenever two of these naturally colourless parts touch each other, which\r\nthey do as the margin of the plate is approached, an irregular ribbon is\r\nproduced, composed of the black band in the centre, with first white and\r\nthen spectrum-coloured flanking strips on each side, the spectra forming\r\nthe edges of the ribbon. The violet sectors show the laminated twinning,\r\nbut, owing to the great thickness of this plate, in too complicated\r\n(overlapping) a manner to be easily followed, a thinner plate being\r\nrequired to show such fine laminations clearly.\r\n\r\nFinally, the third section is such a thinner plate, about 3.5 mm. thick\r\nand nearly 1½ inches in diameter. This section of amethyst is probably\r\nthe most beautiful of all, for it not only shows the laminated twinning\r\nto perfection, in three alternate 60°-sectors and in all six in the\r\nmiddle part of the plate, but also these alternate sectors are\r\ndistinctly violet even to the eye when the specimen is held in the hand\r\nagainst a white background; and the laminations are likewise also\r\nclearly visible on holding the section obliquely up to the light. In\r\npolarised light, either with crossed or parallel or anyway arranged\r\nNicols, the phenomena on the screen are of the most superb character.\r\nThe whole of the middle part of the plate appears made up of six\r\nsectors, _all_ showing the fine laminar bands parallel to the edges of\r\nthe second order hexagonal prism {11̄20}, that is, at 30° to the edges\r\nof the section, the crystal being a first order hexagonal prism {10̄10}.\r\nSome idea of the arrangement will be afforded by Fig. 95, Plate XX. The\r\nmarginal parts develop into alternately right and left-handed sectors or\r\nhalf-sectors, polarising in different and very brilliant colours, and\r\nshowing the ribbon bands at every junction. On rotating the analysing\r\nNicol the changes are remarkably beautiful, particularly for the\r\npositions of the analyser when the laminar bands take on their deep\r\nslate colour, with white and marginally spectral interstrips. The whole\r\nphenomena, indeed, afforded by this plate of amethystine quartz, are the\r\nmost magnificent which the author has ever seen on the screen, in the\r\nwhole of his crystallographic experiences.\r\n\r\nThe Brazilian twinning law of quartz, according to which the plane of\r\ntwinning is parallel to a pair of faces of the second order hexagonal\r\nprism {11̄20}, appears capable of explaining all these varieties of\r\nright and left-handed twins, the interpenetration of the intimate kind\r\nshown in Fig. 85 (page 215) usually resulting in sectorial portions of\r\nspace being occupied by each kind, the surfaces of junction of\r\noppositely optically active parts being, however, very varied in their\r\ndistribution and character. Where they happen to be more or less\r\nhorizontal, a plate cut perpendicularly to the axis to include both\r\nkinds would show Airy’s spirals in convergent polarised light, as may\r\nreadily be demonstrated by such a plate, one of several, in the author’s\r\ncollection. Where they are oblique, a plate cut at right angles to the\r\naxis would, as we have seen experimentally, afford the black, white and\r\nspectral ribbon bands in parallel polarised light. Where, however, the\r\nmode of interpenetration is still more intimate, we have the rapidly\r\nalternating laminæ of the two varieties, right and left-handed, building\r\nup the beautiful structure of amethyst in thin layers. A section-plate\r\nof such an intimate blending of the two varieties, cut as usual\r\nperpendicular to the axis in order that any phenomena of optical\r\nactivity shall be exhibited at the maximum, affords no indication\r\nwhatever of optical rotation, the two varieties simply neutralising each\r\nother’s effects, and the plate behaves as an ordinary uniaxial crystal,\r\naffording in convergent polarised light a black cross like calcite,\r\ncomplete to the centre. In parallel polarised light it shows of course\r\nthe laminated structure, but the tendency to remain dark under crossed\r\nNicols is shown by the fact that the tints exhibited by the laminations\r\nare slates, greys, and even black, when the Nicols are crossed, the\r\ndelightful other colours only making their appearance when the analysing\r\nNicol is rotated. Thus the simple law of Brazilian twinning is quite\r\ncapable of explaining the whole of the phenomena exhibited by composite\r\ncrystals of the two varieties of quartz, and such an explanation is the\r\none accepted by von Groth, in the excellent description of quartz in the\r\nlast edition of his _Physikalische Krystallographie_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 96.—Plan of Amethyst Crystal.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn interesting crystal of amethyst very similar to the third of those\r\njust described, the one illustrated in Fig. 95, was described by Prof.\r\nJudd in the year 1892 to the Mineralogical Society.[18] The plan of the\r\ncrystal is given in Fig. 96. The wedges marked _x_, _y_, _z_, are of a\r\npale yellow colour, as are also the three strips, sections of plates,\r\nproceeding from the wedges and meeting at the centre _o_. The wedge _y_\r\nexhibits left-handed polarisation, and the wedge _z_ right-handed. The\r\nlarge wedge _x_ is composite, the part marked _x__{r} being right-handed\r\nand that marked _x__{l} left-handed. The surface of junction of the two\r\nparts is not perpendicular to the plate, so where the two varieties\r\noverlap, the part marked _x__{rl}, a ribbon band is shown in parallel\r\nlight and Airy’s spirals in convergent polarised light. The yellow parts\r\nof the crystal exhibit ordinary rotatory polarisation colours, even\r\ntints; but in the remaining sectors of the crystal, the lines of\r\ndivision of which are indicated by the radial lines A, B, C, no trace of\r\ncircular polarisation is displayed, and the central part, where the\r\nlamellæ are very well developed, gives the ordinary calcite-like\r\nuniaxial interference figure. The more marginal portions, however, show\r\ncomplicated interference figures, somewhat resembling those of biaxial\r\ncrystals, owing to irregular distribution of the two varieties of\r\nquartz, and probable displacement of the optic axis by distortion.\r\n\r\nAn ingenious theory of the formation of the lamellæ is put forward by\r\nProf. Judd in the same memoir. He had already shown that quartz is\r\nendowed with planes of gliding, parallel to the rhombohedral faces, and\r\nsuggests that the lamellation is the result of the effect of high\r\npressure and possibly high temperature on the quartz crystal after its\r\nformation. The lamellæ appear to be frequently parallel to the\r\nrhombohedral terminal faces of the crystal, as if they were indeed glide\r\nplane effects. It is quite conceivable that the gliding of layers of\r\nmolecules, which when permanent usually involves rotation and inversion\r\nof the molecules, might result in alternately right and left structural\r\narrangements, and there is considerable evidence that the development of\r\nthe purple tint occurred subsequently to the growth of the crystal. It\r\nis probably due to change in the state of oxidation of the trace of\r\nmanganese present as a minute impurity in the quartz crystal, and which\r\nis concentrated between the lamellæ, just as the yellow tint is due to a\r\nslight trace of iron (ferric) oxide. The theory is an interesting one,\r\nand throws considerable light on the possible nature of intimate\r\nlamellar twinning.\r\n\r\nOne last experiment may now be referred to, the concluding experiment of\r\nthe Winnipeg lecture, and which is very reminiscent of the beautiful\r\nslate colour of the lamellæ of amethyst. It is the actual\r\ncrystallisation, projected on the screen, of a thin film of melted\r\nbenzoic acid, which affords radiating closely packed long and narrow\r\ncrystals, shooting out on the screen from centres near the margin of the\r\nfield, very much like the individual crystals of repeatedly twinned\r\nquartz in the beautiful amethyst crystal illustrated in Fig. 95.\r\nProvided the film of melted benzoic acid be thin enough, the crystals\r\nappear on the screen in parallel polarised light, under crossed Nicols,\r\ntinted with the same beautiful shades of slate colour as amethyst, the\r\nintermediate low-order tint between the black and the grey of Newton’s\r\nfirst order spectrum. Some idea of the appearance on the screen is\r\nafforded by Fig. 97, the lower of the two coloured figures in the\r\nfrontispiece. As in the case of Fig. 90, the screen picture was\r\nphotographed directly on a Lumière autochrome plate, and the\r\ntransparency in the actual colours thus obtained was employed as an\r\noriginal wherewith to reproduce the picture on paper by the latest\r\nthree-colour photographic process.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out the experiment a few of the flaky crystals of benzoic\r\nacid are placed on one of the circular glass object plates of the\r\nstandard 1⅞-inch size for the projection polariscope; they are covered\r\nby a second similar one, and the two plates are then held in a pair of\r\ntongs and gently warmed over a small spirit lamp, or miniature Bunsen\r\nlamp. As soon as the crystals have fused, and the melted substance is\r\nevenly spread as a thin film between the two glass plates, the latter\r\nare rapidly transferred to a special mahogany object frame, fitted with\r\na side slide to press the double-plate edge just sufficiently to hold it\r\nin position in the frame, which is then at once placed on the rotating\r\nstage of the polariscope. The screen appears quite dark at first, the\r\nNicols being crossed, but in a second or two as the slide cools the\r\nbenzoic acid begins to crystallise out at the sides, brilliant colours\r\nand the deep greys being both developed, the former chiefly near the\r\nedges of the crystals, rendering the crystallisation wonderfully\r\ndistinct and beautiful on the black background. Then long needle\r\ncrystals shoot out from various quarters one after another or\r\nsimultaneously, in lovely shades of slate or grey tinted with brilliant\r\ncolours at the margins and tips, the growing point cutting its way along\r\nlike a sharp brilliantly coloured arrowhead. Eventually an arch is\r\nformed of such acicular crystals, radiating simultaneously from many\r\ncentres, gorgeously coloured in parts, but showing the yet more æsthetic\r\nslates and greys in the main. Finally, the whole screen picture fills up\r\nwith a mass of interlacing yet ever distinct crystals, the last few to\r\ncrystallise in the centre usually doing so with a burst of especially\r\nbright colour, as the thickness increases adequately for the double\r\nrefraction retardation to reach the more brilliant second order\r\nspectrum, a concluding effect which evokes the emphatic delight of even\r\nthe most phlegmatic philosopher, inured to scenes of beauty in natural\r\nphenomena.\r\n\r\nThe series of experiments with quartz described in this and the previous\r\nchapter, culminating with those revealing the alternate repetition of\r\nextremely fine layers of right and left-handed quartz in amethyst, will,\r\nit is hoped, have illustrated and rendered intelligible the important\r\nstructural principle of enantiomorphism or mirror-image symmetry. We\r\nhave only to imagine the layers to become thinner and thinner until we\r\napproach ultimately the neighbourhood of the minute dimensions of the\r\nchemical molecule, without as yet penetrating within the range of the\r\nmolecular forces; the two such oppositely constructed and intimately\r\nblended structures, built up by atoms arranged oppositely screw-wise,\r\nclockwise and anti-clockwise, will now form an ultramicroscopic mixture\r\nof the two varieties in equal quantities, that is, in equal molecular\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nSuch a structure will exhibit the symmetry of the system to which the\r\ntwo individuals belong, but instead of only displaying that of the\r\nenantiomorphous class of that system, possessing lower than the full\r\nsymmetry, as each variety does when crystallised alone, it will now\r\ndisplay the full holohedral symmetry of the system. That is, the\r\nsymmetry is enhanced by this intimate blending of the two complementary\r\nenantiomorphous forms, the two together supplying all the possible\r\nelements of symmetry of which the system is capable. Moreover, as we\r\nhave seen in the case of the lamellar portion of the amethyst crystals\r\nrepresented in Figs. 95 and 96, there will now be no sign of optical\r\nactivity, for the two opposite rotations are equal and destroy each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nHence, such a compound crystal shows the holohedral symmetry of the\r\nsystem, and is optically inactive. In such cases we are, in fact,\r\nconfronted with the phenomenon of pseudo-racemism, as defined in Chapter\r\nXI. For we know that the two varieties are still present intact,\r\npolarised light revealing them in the case of their grosser development\r\nsuch as is found in amethyst, and the system of symmetry being clearly\r\nthe same, the forms developed being merely the sum of those of the two\r\nindividual varieties.\r\n\r\nAmethyst thus affords us a gross demonstration of the nature of\r\npseudo-racemism, and as such has proved an exceedingly illuminating\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\nWe can carry the process further, however, in imagination, until the two\r\ndifferently helical molecules are themselves juxtaposed face to face,\r\nright molecule to left molecule. When, however, this occurs, we have\r\nentered into that most fascinatingly interesting region, the range of\r\nmolecular forces, a mysterious sphere of activities of which we are only\r\njust beginning to learn something. Within this region of larger activity\r\nthe two oppositely constructed molecules are often known to combine\r\nchemically to produce a molecular compound, just as potassium sulphate\r\nmolecules, for instance, will combine with those of magnesium sulphate\r\nto form the well-known double salt. The double molecule now furnishes\r\nthe representative point of the space-lattice, in other words, a new\r\nspace-lattice is now erected, the units of which may be taken to be the\r\nrepresentative points of the double molecules. Such a space-lattice will\r\nof necessity be of a totally different character to the old one\r\ncorresponding to the single molecule of either variety (for each variety\r\nhas the same space-lattice, the points, however, representing\r\ndifferently, enantiomorphously, orientated atomic details). That is to\r\nsay, we shall have an entirely new kind of crystal produced, in all\r\nprobability belonging to a different crystal system. It is known as a\r\nracemic compound, as described in Chapter XI.\r\n\r\nThis is exactly what happens in the case of tartaric acid, the two\r\nvarieties, dextro or right-handed tartaric acid and lævo or left-handed\r\ntartaric acid, not forming pseudo-racemic crystals of like but enhanced\r\n(holohedral) symmetry, but a truly molecular compound, the well-known\r\ninactive racemic acid, in which the phenomenon of “racemism” was first\r\ndiscovered and from which it took its name.\r\n\r\nNow a molecular compound is notoriously regarded by chemists as a type\r\nof chemical compound of low stability, molecular attraction or affinity\r\nnot being nearly so powerful as atomic affinity. Hence, under suitable\r\nconditions it may be possible to induce the two component varieties to\r\ncrystallise out separately from the solution of the racemic compound. In\r\nthe case of racemic acid itself this does not readily happen, but in the\r\ncases of certain of its metallic salts, sodium ammonium racemate, for\r\ninstance, specific conditions are known under which the two varieties of\r\ncrystals, right and left-handed respectively, may be separately\r\ncrystallised out from the solution, some of which conditions were\r\nreferred to in Chapter XI. Racemic acid itself, however, crystallises\r\nquite differently to the two tartaric acids, namely, in triclinic\r\nprismatic crystals. These are, in fact, absolutely different from the\r\nmonoclinic crystals of the dextro and lævo varieties of ordinary\r\ntartaric acid, for racemic acid takes up also a molecule of water of\r\ncrystallisation on separating from its aqueous solution. There are\r\ncertain chemical differences also, due to the chemical union of the two\r\nenantiomorphous molecules into a single double molecule, such, for\r\ninstance, as greater facility of reduction by hydriodic acid to succinic\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nThus our experiments with quartz have afforded us the means of acquiring\r\na clear idea of the nature of this most interesting type of crystal\r\nstructure which involves the principle of mirror-image symmetry. Racemic\r\nacid and its similar structures, racemic compounds in general, are known\r\nas “externally compensated” structures, the reflective principle here\r\nacting externally to the single enantiomorphous molecule. It is but\r\nanother step, however, to imagine internal compensation of\r\nenantiomorphous parts of a molecule, by mirror-image combination of such\r\nparts, such as in all probability occurs in the case of the truly\r\ninactive fourth variety of tartaric acid, in order to comprehend how the\r\nprinciple enabled the 165 types of homogeneous structure involving this\r\nkind of repetition to be arrived at, and thus, together with the 65\r\nregular point-systems already known, to afford us the complete set of\r\n230 types of homogeneous structures possible to crystals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n                  HOW A CRYSTAL GROWS FROM A SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most deeply interesting aspects of a crystal, especially from\r\nthe point of view of the history of crystallographic investigation,\r\nconcerns the mysterious process of its growth from a solution (in a\r\nsolvent) of the substance composing it. The story of the elucidation, as\r\nfar as it has yet been accomplished, of the nature of crystallisation\r\nfrom solution in water is one of the most romantic which the whole of\r\nscientific progress can furnish. Again we are struck with the\r\nparallelism between crystals and living objects. For just as the\r\ndiscovery of bacteria, the infinitesimal germs of life, has given an\r\nimmense impetus to our knowledge of disease and been blessed with most\r\nbeneficent effects in combatting the ravages of the latter, so the\r\ndiscovery that crystal-germs of most common crystallised substances, of\r\nno larger size than bacteria, are floating about in our atmosphere, and\r\nready at any time to drop into our solutions and, if the latter are in\r\nthe proper receptive condition, to set them crystallising, is little\r\nless marvellous, and has had as profound an effect on our knowledge of\r\nthe process of crystallisation. A true story, told to the Royal Society\r\nthe other day, may serve to illustrate the point. A new chemical\r\ncompound had been discovered, and at the time there could obviously be\r\nno crystal-germs, minute crystallites of the dimensions of possibly only\r\na comparatively few chemical molecules, of this hitherto unknown\r\nsubstance floating about in the air. It was found impossible to obtain\r\nthe deposition of crystals in the ordinary way, from solutions of the\r\nsubstance in its ordinary solvent, although they were in the condition\r\nof proper receptivity above referred to, on account of the absence of\r\nsuch germs in the air. But later on, when the air of the laboratory had\r\nbecome impregnated with such germs, on account of the daily handling of\r\nthe substance in the laboratory, no difficulty was any longer found in\r\nobtaining good crystals quite readily from these solutions.\r\n\r\nWe are at first inclined to wonder whether such extraordinary statements\r\ncan possibly be sober facts. Yet such is, indeed, the case, and it will\r\nbe very well worth devoting a chapter to the story of how we have at\r\nlength arrived at definite knowledge concerning the process of\r\ncrystallisation from the state of solution in water. For water is the\r\nordinary solvent from which we obtain our crystals, that is, such as are\r\nprepared artificially in the laboratory. The laws which have been\r\ndiscovered to hold for aqueous solutions are, however, equally\r\napplicable to the cases where other solvents are used, such for instance\r\nas the usual organic solvents like alcohol, ether, chloroform, and\r\nbenzene.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which crystallisation occurs from the liquid state,\r\nor from solution of the substance in a solvent, have been accurately\r\ndetermined experimentally by H. A. Miers,[19] and they bear out in the\r\nmain the predictions from theoretical considerations which were made by\r\nOstwald.[20] Taking first the case of crystallisation from solution,\r\nthere are two distinct curves representing the degree of solubility of\r\nthe solid substance and of supersolubility. The well-known ordinary\r\nsolubility curve is obtained by taking the temperature for abscissæ and\r\nconcentration for ordinates, so that any point on the curve indicates\r\nthe amount of the solid substance which the solvent can hold in solution\r\nat that particular temperature. Now the fact that supersaturation may\r\noccur has long been established, the phenomenon being of frequent\r\noccurrence; and it is common knowledge that a supersaturated solution\r\nmay be preserved for a long time without crystals being deposited from\r\nit, provided the liquid be maintained quietly at rest. Obviously,\r\ntherefore, this condition of supersaturation ought to be represented by\r\na second curve a few degrees lower as regards temperature than the\r\nsolubility curve, and its conditions were fairly fully predicted by\r\nOstwald, after collecting together and analysing the results of the\r\nexperiments of Gernez, Lecoq de Boisbaudran, J. M. Thomson, de Coppet,\r\nLefebvre, and Roozeboom. It was reserved for Miers, however, to discover\r\na means of experimentally tracing this curve, by observations of the\r\nrefractive index of the solution. The point at which the deposition of\r\ncrystals from the supersaturated solution occurs is immediately\r\nindicated by a sudden change in the refraction of the liquid, the\r\nrefractive index attaining its maximum value at the temperature of\r\nspontaneous crystallisation, and then dropping suddenly the moment the\r\ncrystals begin to fall. Moreover, the solution at the same time records\r\nits own strength, for the refractive index varies directly as the amount\r\nof salt dissolved. The determination of the strength of the solution at\r\nthe critical moment itself had previously proved an impossibility by\r\nordinary methods.\r\n\r\nFig. 98 gives a general diagrammatic representation of Miers’ results\r\nfor a typical crystalline substance soluble in water. S is the ordinary\r\nsolubility curve, which may also be termed the “curve of crystallisation\r\nby inoculation.” For as soon as the solution reaches this condition of\r\nnormal saturation it is liable to be caused to commence crystallising if\r\na germ crystal, that is, a miniature crystallite floating in the air as\r\ndust, of the substance itself or of one isomorphous with it or capable\r\nof forming parallel growths with it, fall into the solution from the\r\nair. It has been a revelation to us that such minute crystallites of all\r\ncommon substances are scattered broadcast in our atmosphere, and that\r\nsooner or later one will introduce itself into any solution set to\r\ncrystallise which is not sealed up or placed in a vessel with a\r\nfiltering plug of cotton-wool in its neck or other aperture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 98.—Diagram illustrating the Conditions for Crystallisation from\r\n    Solution or the Liquid State.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSS is the supersolubility curve, situated approximately 10° to the left\r\nof the solubility curve as regards temperature, but about as much above\r\nas regards concentration, so that the two curves usually run diagonally\r\nand more or less parallel to each other across the diagram. This\r\nsupersolubility curve may be also called the “curve of spontaneous\r\ncrystallisation,” for it represents the conditions under which alone\r\ncrystals may begin to form without the initiating impulse of inoculation\r\nby a germ-crystallite. On the suggestion of Ostwald it is also termed\r\nthe “metastable limit,” and the whole area between the solubility and\r\nsupersolubility curves is named the area of metastability, that which\r\nrepresents the “metastable” condition of the solution. Within this area\r\nthe conditions are those for the start of crystallisation by\r\ninoculation. The area beyond the supersolubility curve represents the\r\n“labile” state, in which the conditions are those for spontaneous\r\ncrystallisation, inoculation being no longer necessary. These precise\r\nresults will, it is hoped, be quite clear with the aid of Fig. 98.\r\n\r\nHence, when a cooling solution not quite saturated at the higher\r\nstarting temperature is stirred in an open vessel a slight shower of\r\ncrystals, started by inoculation, appears when the saturation point is\r\nreached, which Miers calls a “metastable shower,” corresponding to the\r\nordinary solubility curve; the liquid then goes on cooling without\r\ndepositing the main bulk of the excess which that curve indicates ought\r\nto be deposited, if it represent the whole truth. But when the\r\ntemperature of the supersolubility curve about 10° lower is reached, a\r\nmuch more copious shower falls by spontaneous crystallisation, the\r\n“labile shower.”\r\n\r\nIn a closed vessel, such for instance as a glass tube sealed with the\r\naid of the blowpipe after the introduction of the solution, on cooling\r\nafter heating to a temperature superior to that of saturation, the first\r\nshower never falls at all, no amount of shaking inducing the deposition\r\nof crystals at the ordinary saturation point, proving that the slight\r\nshower of the experiment in the open vessel is due to crystal-germs\r\nintroduced from the atmosphere. The second shower of crystals falls at\r\nthe lower temperature just as before, however, at the temperature of the\r\nsupersolubility curve, indicating that this shower is due in both cases\r\nto spontaneous crystallisation. Solutions thus enclosed in sealed tubes,\r\nto which inoculating dust crystals cannot have access, can never be made\r\nto crystallise at any temperature higher than that given by the\r\nsupersolubility curve, however agitated, although they immediately do\r\ncrystallise, if shaken, as soon as that temperature is reached during\r\nthe cooling. If allowed to remain absolutely quiet, however, the\r\ntemperature may fall considerably lower before any crystallisation\r\noccurs, the labile region being frequently well penetrated before this\r\nhappens. When crystallisation does supervene, the temperature usually\r\nrises somewhat. After the labile shower has been deposited, the crystals\r\ncontinue to grow steadily further, until the metastable region has been\r\ntraversed, and the saturation state is eventually reached, when final\r\nequilibrium is produced.\r\n\r\nThe proof that the crystals deposited in the metastable condition were\r\nstarted by the advent of atmospheric germ crystals—that is, by\r\ninfinitesimal but perfectly structurally developed crystals, carried by\r\ntheir very lightness like the particles of dust which are only revealed\r\nin the path of a sunbeam as seen against a dark background—was afforded\r\nby a series of experiments with a mixture of two rare organic chemical\r\npreparations, salol (phenyl salicylate) a substance melting at 42.5°,\r\nand betol (β-naphthol salicylate) another melting at 92°, which Miers\r\nassumed were not likely to be present in ordinary air. The assumption\r\nproved well grounded, and the first shower never fell at all in the\r\nearlier experiments in which mixtures of these two substances were\r\nallowed to cool in open vessels, from the state of fusion. But very soon\r\nthe air of the laboratory became impregnated with crystallites of both\r\nsubstances, due to the very operations themselves being carried on in\r\ncontact with the air, and in the later experiments the first shower of\r\ncrystals did fall. The experiments were really designed to effect the\r\ndetermination of the solubility curve for salol and betol in each other,\r\nthat is, the freezing-point curve of their mixtures, and the discovery\r\nof the so-called “eutectic” point at which a mixture of constant\r\ncomposition solidifies at a definite temperature. But incidentally the\r\nexperiments also served to establish similar laws for the production of\r\ncrystals from the liquefied state, by cooling below the melting point,\r\nto those applying to crystallisation from solution. In the case of the\r\nmixtures of the substances the one of lower melting point acted as a\r\nsolvent for the one of higher melting point, just as water does for\r\nsalt. Two curves corresponding to the ordinary freezing point and to the\r\nlimit of superfusion were established, analogous to the solubility and\r\nsupersolubility curves. Pure salol alone proved to crystallise\r\nspontaneously at 33°, 9½° below its melting point, and the refractive\r\nindex attained a maximum for this temperature. Betol spontaneously\r\ncrystallised at 79°, 13° below its melting point.\r\n\r\nTwo general cases of crystallisation are shown by the dotted curves ABCD\r\nand ABE in Fig. 98. The first, represented by ABCD, is the case of a\r\nsupersaturated solution, made by adding the salt to hot water, being\r\nallowed to cool slowly while stirred. The solution cools from A to B\r\nwithout anything visibly happening, no crystal-germ falling into the\r\nsolution until B is reached, somewhere well within the metastable\r\nregion. When the germ has fallen in, however, crystals begin to appear\r\nas a slight shower at B, and from B to C they continue to grow slowly.\r\nOn reaching the labile condition at C a cloud of crystals, the heavy\r\nshower, is deposited, and the concentration falls rapidly to D on the\r\nsolubility curve, generally with slight rise of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe second case is the important one employed by the author in the\r\ninvestigations which will be found described in his “Crystalline\r\nStructure and Chemical Constitution” (Macmillan & Co., 1910), for the\r\npurpose of producing crystals of high perfection for goniometrical\r\ninvestigation. The method can be confidently recommended as the one best\r\nadapted to afford good measurable crystals, and is of quite general\r\napplication. The solution is made up so as to be in the metastable\r\ncondition, that is, only slightly supersaturated for the ordinary\r\ntemperatures. Eventually, while the solution is at rest in a protected\r\nplace, free from draughts or vibration, and after it has cooled to the\r\ntemperature of the air, a crystal-germ enters, followed probably by\r\nothers; each forms a centre of crystal growth, which proceeds very\r\nslowly and deliberately, keeping pace with the evaporation in such a\r\nmanner that the labile condition is never reached. The natural result is\r\nthe production of very well-formed crystals bounded by excellent faces,\r\ntruly plane and free from striation or distortion.\r\n\r\nWhen the operation is arranged to occur during the night, as will\r\nusually be the case, the solution being set out to crystallise in a\r\nquiet and protected place on the previous afternoon or evening, the\r\nslight fall of temperature during the night gently assists the process\r\nand almost ensures a good crop of a few well-formed crystals large\r\nenough for goniometrical purposes next morning. They should be removed\r\nbefore the temperature begins to rise again with the advent of the sun,\r\ndried with blotting paper and by air exposure for a short time, and\r\nstored in a miniature bottle labelled with the name or formula of the\r\nsubstance and the date of collection of the crop. In such cases the\r\nlabile state is never reached, and the course of the crystallisation is\r\nrepresented by the curve BE. The whole conditions for the curve ABE,\r\nhowever, would correspond to much lower temperatures, such as those\r\ngiven at the foot of the diagram below the word “temperature,” rather\r\nthan to the upper row of temperature abscissæ suitable for the other\r\npurposes of the diagram already referred to. Crystallisation might well\r\nbegin about 13° or 14°, as shown at B, and the liquid would cool a\r\ncouple of degrees or more during the night while crystallisation was\r\nsteadily proceeding, until equilibrium was reached at E on the\r\nsolubility curve.\r\n\r\nThe diagram does not represent any substance in particular, but is a\r\nperfectly general one, corresponding to the facts observed with most of\r\nthe very varied salts worked with by Miers and those of which the author\r\nhas had experience. The exact temperatures and concentrations will, of\r\ncourse, differ for each substance.\r\n\r\nA beautiful experimental demonstration of crystallisation from the\r\nmetastable and labile conditions of solution respectively is afforded by\r\npotassium bichromate, K_{2}Cr_{2}O_{7}. When deposited slowly from a\r\nmetastable solution under conditions of quietude, this salt is slowly\r\ndeposited in bright orange coloured and excellently formed crystals,\r\noften of considerable size, belonging to the triclinic system of\r\nsymmetry; they are bounded by good pinakoidal (pairs of parallel) faces\r\nintersecting in sharp edges. But when the crystallisation occurs from a\r\nlabile solution, being much more rapid, it takes the form of feathery or\r\narborescent branching skeletal growths, there being inadequate time for\r\nthe formation of well-developed crystals.\r\n\r\nFig. 99, Plate XXI., is a photographic reproduction of well-formed\r\ncrystals of potassium bichromate, grown from a solution in the\r\nmetastable condition on a microscope slip, just as they are seen through\r\nthe microscope in the slow act of formation, employing a 1½ inch\r\nobjective. The crystallisation had been started by germ crystals of the\r\nsalt falling in from the air, after which the drop, placed within the\r\nring of hardened gold size on the slide, had been covered with a\r\ncover-glass, under which the crystallisation had proceeded with\r\nsufficient slowness to enable a successful photograph to be taken, when\r\nthe camera was subsequently attached above the vertically arranged\r\nmicroscope. An upright micrographic apparatus had been designed by the\r\nauthor specially for this photography of growing crystals, many of the\r\nresults of which are reproduced in this book.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XXI._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 99.—Potassium Bichromate slowly crystallising from a Metastable\r\n    Solution.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 100.—Potassium Bichromate rapidly crystallised from a Labile\r\n    Solution.\r\n\r\n  CHARACTERISTIC DIFFERENCE IN THE CRYSTALS DEPOSITED FROM METASTABLE\r\n    AND LABILE SOLUTIONS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 100 is the reproduction of another photograph taken under similar\r\nconditions, but employing a hot and somewhat more concentrated solution\r\nof potassium bichromate, and making the exposure at the moment when, in\r\nthe particular field chosen, a rapid labile crystallisation was just\r\ncompleting itself, the rapidity of growth of the feathery skeletal\r\ncrystals having just become arrested. Indeed, the branches are\r\nfrequently terminated by small well-formed crystals, the rapid growth\r\nhaving been succeeded by a final slow crystallisation where the solution\r\nhad discharged its labile excess and attained once more the metastable\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThis experiment with potassium bichromate lends itself admirably to\r\nlantern demonstration with the projection microscope. When the drop of\r\nhot concentrated solution is first placed on the warmed microscope slip,\r\nand the latter laid on the stage, nothing visible on the screen happens\r\nfor a minute or two, the solution becoming, however, more or less\r\nrapidly cooled. But suddenly, the drop having cooled sufficiently to\r\nbring the solution to the labile condition of supersaturation\r\ncorresponding to the conditions for spontaneous crystallisation\r\nindicated by the supersolubility curve, arborescent or feathery growths\r\nbegin to shoot out from various points in the field, often near the\r\nmargin, and traverse the screen so rapidly that in a moment or two it is\r\nfilled with them. The crystallisation then slows down once more, the\r\nlabile shower of excess having become exhausted, and the terminations of\r\nthe branches and ramifications begin to develop into good little\r\ncrystals, which thus hang like fruit on a tree. The experiment is\r\nrendered the more brilliant and beautiful by the bright orange colour of\r\nthe crystals.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 101, Plate XI., facing page 88, a reproduction of a photograph\r\nof a similar crystallisation from a labile solution of ammonium chloride\r\nis given. This salt is also particularly suitable for screen\r\ndemonstrations. The beautiful skeletal ramifications follow the axial\r\ndirections of the cubic axes, ammonium chloride crystallising in the\r\npentagonal-icositetrahedral class of the cubic system. Good crystals\r\nmay, however, be very slowly grown from metastable solutions, and they\r\nusually exhibit as the principal forms the icositetrahedron\r\n(predominating), cube, octahedron, rhombic dodecahedron, and the\r\nclass-distinguishing pentagonal icositetrahedron. The rapid growths by\r\nspontaneous crystallisation of labile solutions, however, invariably\r\ntake the form of the rectangularly branching feathery crystals shown in\r\nFig. 101.\r\n\r\nFurther light has been thrown on the act of crystallisation by another\r\nmost interesting research of Miers concerning “vicinal faces,”[21] such\r\nas the three very low pyramid faces (forming a very flat triakis\r\noctahedron) which often replace each octahedron face on a crystal of\r\nalum which has been grown somewhat rapidly. The author has frequently\r\nobserved this phenomenon in the course of the numerous crystallisations\r\nrequired for the investigation of the sulphates and selenates. It may be\r\ndescribed in general terms as the replacement of primary faces\r\npossessing the simplest rational indices by faces having such high\r\nindices that it is doubtful whether they ought really to be represented\r\nby indices at all. The number of such vicinal faces which replace the\r\nsimple face depends on the symmetry of the crystal, to which, of course,\r\nthey conform. Thus, while three such vicinal faces replace an octahedral\r\nface, and two replace the face of a tetragonal prism, the simple primary\r\nprism face of a rhombic or monoclinic crystal would only be replaced by\r\none, which may have a deformation of as much as even 30′ from the\r\ncorrect position of the prism face, and on either side of it. Indeed it\r\nis possible for a whole succession of such vicinal faces to be developed\r\nwithin the degree of arc which may in extreme cases separate the\r\nlimiting values on each side of the prism face, and such are often seen\r\nand make up the well-known bundle of images afforded on the goniometer\r\nby a bad face, a face which would cause the author at once to reject the\r\nwhole crystal for measurement purposes. One of the faces, even in cases\r\nsuch as alum or a tetragonal crystal, where three or two might have\r\nequal values as regards the symmetry, generally predominates, and\r\naffords a very much more brilliant image of the goniometer signal than\r\nthe others in the bundle, so that an unwary observer might easily come\r\nto the conclusion that this was the really valid image corresponding to\r\nthe octahedron face or to the simple primary prism face, or whatever\r\nparticular face was expected in the neighbourhood indicated by the\r\nbundle of images. Obviously, however, it might only be one of three or\r\ntwo equally valid faces of a vicinal form, which had grown\r\npredominatingly during the last period of growth previous to removal\r\nfrom the mother liquor.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this interesting phenomenon of the production of\r\nvicinal faces is one intimately connected with the structure of\r\ncrystals, and it forms one of the strongest confirmations of the\r\ncorrectness of the theory of crystal structure the basis of which is the\r\nmolecular space-lattice. Miers is in full agreement with the author in\r\nemphasising the importance of the space-lattice formed by the “points”\r\nrepresentative of the molecules, and analogously chosen in the\r\nmolecules. He says: “Whatever structures may be necessary to account for\r\nother features of crystals, there is little doubt that we are justified\r\nin regarding their faces as the planes of a space-lattice.”[22] Now\r\nWulff,[23] who has contributed very considerably to our knowledge of the\r\nnature of the act of crystallisation, has proved, from his own\r\ninvestigations and those of Weyberg, carried out at his suggestion in\r\nhis laboratory at Warsaw,[24] that faces of greatest reticular density,\r\nthat is, those along which the points of the space-lattice are most\r\nthickly strewn, are those which grow the most slowly, and therefore are\r\nthe best developed. This latter will be obvious on a little\r\nconsideration, for the faces of less reticular density which grow more,\r\ntend in doing so to extend the boundaries of the faces of greatest\r\nreticular density, and thus to enlarge those faces. Hence the usual\r\nplanes on a crystal must be those of high reticular density; and these\r\nare such as are represented by the simplest indices, the faces most\r\ndense of all in points being the primary ones.\r\n\r\nBut it has been shown from the researches of Miers that vicinal faces\r\nare often produced in preference to these simple index planes of high\r\ndensity, and such vicinal faces, although the nearest (in angular\r\nposition) of all possible faces to those simple index planes, are\r\nthemselves of excessively low reticular density, so much so that if\r\nrepresented by indices at all they can only be indicated by very high\r\nnumbers, not such as we are accustomed to consider as in keeping with\r\nthe simple spirit of the law of rational indices. Taking the example\r\nworked out most fully by Miers, the octahedral crystals of alum, it is a\r\nfact that the cubic faces of highest reticular density are those of the\r\ncube itself, then come in order those of the rhombic dodecahedron and\r\nthose of the octahedron. Hence, the density of octahedral faces is very\r\nhigh. But those of the very low triakis octahedron, which Miers finds to\r\nreplace the octahedron faces so frequently as vicinal faces, are of\r\nexcessively low reticular density.\r\n\r\nMiers explains the appearance of the latter instead of octahedral faces\r\nby assuming that the supersaturated liquid in contact with the growing\r\ncrystal consists of the particles (molecules) of salt uniformly mingled\r\nwith those of water, the solvent, and that the act of crystallisation\r\nconsists of the escape of the water and solidification of the salt.\r\nConsequently, the salt particles just before crystallisation cannot be\r\nso dense as they are along primary planes of the crystal, as they are\r\nseparated by the water particles, which are presumably much more\r\nnumerous. Hence it is that they are not deposited along the planes of\r\nhigh reticular density, but along vicinal planes of low density of\r\npoints. For instance, he shows that the shower of salt particles upon a\r\ncube face would have to be so dense that there would be insufficient\r\nroom for the water particles. The density in a cube face is 114 times as\r\ngreat as that in one of the vicinal planes observed. Now, 100 cubic\r\ncentimetres of solid alum weigh 172 grammes, and 100 c.c. of the\r\nsolution depositing crystals contain 9·74 grammes of alum. Thus the\r\ndensity of the growing crystal of alum is nearly 18 times that of the\r\nalum in the adjacent saturated solution.\r\n\r\nConsequently the deposition of the salt particles, in a moderately quick\r\ncrystallisation, when insufficient time is afforded for the deliberate\r\nescape of the water particles and for the orderly rearrangement of the\r\nsalt particles, occurs along vicinal planes instead of along the primary\r\nplanes. For it must not be forgotten that whenever it has the\r\nopportunity of coming into operation there is a directive molecular\r\nforce of some kind, which controls the operation of crystallisation, and\r\nwhich undoubtedly attempts to cause, and given adequate time and scope\r\nsucceeds in causing, the production of faces of high reticular density,\r\nthe fundamentally important primary faces of lowest indices, and which\r\nare often those along which cleavage occurs. Wulff emphasises this in\r\nsaying (_loc. cit._, p. 461): “Bei der Krystallisation orientiren sich\r\ndie Molekeln auf den Flächen des Krystalles ganz gleichförmig durch den\r\nEinfluss der Richtkraft der Krystallisation.” The more rapidly the\r\ncrystallisation occurs, however, the less chance is there for this force\r\nto attain its ultimate object. More will be said about this directive\r\nforce in the next chapter, after we have studied the remarkable “liquid\r\ncrystals” discovered by Lehmann.\r\n\r\nThis highly interesting explanation of Miers, supported as it is by the\r\nwork of Wulff, and confirmed also in many respects by the observations\r\nof the author, whose great aim throughout his investigations has been to\r\navoid the production of such vicinal faces, throws an important light on\r\nthe nature of the act of crystallisation. It renders the reason clear\r\nwhy crystals which are very slowly grown from solutions only feebly\r\nsupersaturated and under conditions of absolute rest, protected from\r\neither air currents or preventable earth tremors—conditions which the\r\nauthor has taken quite exceptional pains to procure for the preparation\r\nof the crystals used in the investigation of the sulphates and selenates\r\nof the rhombic simple salt series and monoclinic double salt series—are\r\noccasionally obtained quite free from any sign of such vicinal faces.\r\nThey are small perfect individuals exhibiting primarily the faces of\r\nhigh reticular density, that is, the faces of the simple forms of low\r\nrational indices; and these faces are absolutely plane, affording one\r\nsingle brilliant image of the goniometer signal, which can be adjusted\r\nwith great precision to the cross-wires of the telescope. For the slower\r\nthe growth, the more time is afforded for the escape of the water\r\nmolecules, and for the salt molecules to deposit themselves as directed\r\nby the molecular guiding force of crystallisation, along the planes of\r\nhigh reticular density. In many of his experiments Miers expressly\r\nstirred the solution, to prevent concentration currents, which had been\r\nconsidered by Wulff of importance in the process, from coming into play\r\nand causing unknown effects. Hence his experiments in which vicinal\r\nfaces were produced are not comparable with the author’s slow growths.\r\n\r\nThe work of Miers assists in the proof that the constancy of angle to\r\nwithin one or two minutes of arc is a real property of the crystals of a\r\nsubstance. For previously the frequent presence of vicinal faces rather\r\nthan the simple forms of high reticular density, and which had been\r\nmistaken for the latter, had caused Pfaff in 1878[25] and others to\r\nconclude that variations from the true crystal angle amounting to as\r\nmuch as 30′ were of common occurrence as the result of strain during\r\ndeposition.\r\n\r\nBrauns[26] in 1887 made a careful series of measurements of very good\r\noctahedral crystals of lead nitrate, and found 13′ 20″ the largest\r\ndeviation of a good image from the theoretical position. He imputed it\r\nto the action of gravity as a disturbing cause during deposition. The\r\nresearches of Miers have cleared away all this misconception, in proving\r\nthat the bright images referred to, taken for those of the simple\r\nprimary form, are not such at all, but vicinal faces of very low\r\nreticular density.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n                            LIQUID CRYSTALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the foregoing pages that a crystal is usually a solid,\r\nhighly organised in a homogeneous manner, and, unless the symmetry be\r\ndeveloped to its highest extent, the crystal then belonging to the cubic\r\nsystem, it is also in general anisotropic, that is, it exhibits double\r\nrefraction. Section-plates of it, more or less thin according to the\r\nstrength of the double refraction, exhibit colours in parallel polarised\r\nlight, and show the phenomenon of a single optic axis, or of two optic\r\naxes, in convergent polarised light. Every variety of hardness, however,\r\nis displayed, from that of the diamond down to that of a crystal as soft\r\nas gypsum, and even softer. Moreover, many of the softer crystallised\r\nsubstances develop the property of permitting one layer to glide over\r\nanother by gentle side pressure with a knife blade, when inserted in an\r\nedge or face in an attempt to cut the crystal. Calcite and ice, for\r\ninstance, both possess such planes of gliding of the structural units\r\nover one another in layers. There are also the border line cases of\r\ncrystals so soft as to be readily bent, and many well-known viscous\r\nsubstances crystallisable only with great difficulty, some of which form\r\npliable crystals.\r\n\r\nBut in the year 1876 Lehmann discovered a new property in an already\r\nremarkable substance, iodide of silver, AgI, namely, that at\r\ntemperatures superior to 146° C. it can flow like a viscous liquid,\r\nwhile exhibiting several of the properties which are characteristic of\r\ncrystals. Silver iodide is dimorphous, exhibiting a hexagonal form at\r\nthe ordinary temperature, which persists up to 146°. But during the\r\nheating to the latter temperature a regularly accelerating diminution of\r\nvolume occurs, the feeble expansion in directions perpendicular to the\r\naxis being overbalanced by a considerable contraction along the axis,\r\nboth quantities having been accurately measured so long ago as the year\r\n1867 by Fizeau, by means of his delicate interference dilatometer. This\r\ncontraction, so unusual an occurrence with increase of temperature,\r\nculminates at 146°, according to Mallard and Le Chatelier, in a sudden\r\nchange of condition into a cubic modification, accompanied by absorption\r\nof heat. Now Lehmann, studying this cubic modification of silver iodide\r\nunder a microscope which he had devised—specially adapted for\r\nobservations at temperatures higher than the ordinary, by being supplied\r\nwith the means of heating the object under observation—found that it was\r\nnot only plastic, but actually a liquid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 102.—Lehmann’s Crystallisation Microscope.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe form of Lehmann’s “Crystallisation Microscope,” as now constructed\r\nby Zeiss, is shown in Fig. 102. Its essential features are that the\r\nglass object-plate, which is somewhat wider than the usual microscope 3\r\nby 1 inches slip, is supported by little metallic columns at a height an\r\ninch or more above the ordinary stage, and may be heated from below by a\r\nminiature Bunsen burner, which is provided with a delicate graduated\r\ngas-tap and is adjustable for its position, swinging in or out as\r\ndesired. The small Bunsen flame may be converted into a blowpipe flame\r\nif necessary, an air-blast attachment to a mixing reservoir being\r\nprovided, to which the arm of the burner is hinged. Two cooling blasts,\r\nconnected with a gas-holder of air, are also provided, and are\r\nadjustable to the most suitable symmetrical positions above the slide\r\nfor directing the cooling air on the part of the latter where the liquid\r\nis situated. These arrangements enable the substance on the slide to be\r\nrapidly or slowly heated or cooled at will. Electric connections are\r\nalso provided, in the event of the observer desiring to study the\r\nbehaviour of the liquid crystals under the influence of the electric\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nConsiderably later, in the year 1889, the attention of Lehmann was\r\ncalled by Reinitzer to another similarly singular substance, cholesteryl\r\nbenzoate, which appeared to consist of an aggregate of minute crystals\r\nwhich flow as readily as oil, while preserving many of the characters of\r\ncrystals.\r\n\r\nIn the next year, 1890, the substance para-azoxyphenetol, then recently\r\ndiscovered by Gattermann, was observed by Lehmann to form a turbid\r\n“melt” on fusion, which consisted of an aggregate of crystals flowing\r\nwith a mobility equal to that of water, and which take the form of\r\nspherical drops showing a dark kernel inside, as shown at _a_ in Fig.\r\n103, quite unlike a drop of ordinary liquid. The kernel disappears on\r\nshaking, but reappears on coming to rest again. In polarised light the\r\ndrops show dichroism, that is two different colours in different parts\r\nor directions, being divided into white and yellow parts, the yellow as\r\na pair of opposite approximately 60°-sectors, as indicated at _c_ in\r\nFig. 103. Under crossed Nicols they show a black cross, as represented\r\nat _d_ in Fig. 103.\r\n\r\nNow obviously these drops are doubly refractive, and their whole optical\r\nbehaviour corresponds to the arrangement of the molecules in concentric\r\ncircles, such as that suggested at _b_ in Fig. 103.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 103.—Liquid Crystals of Para-azoxy-phenetol arranged in Spherical\r\n    Drops.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAnother substance of like character, para-azoxy-anisol, was subsequently\r\nfound to behave similarly, and forms an excellent substance to use for\r\ndemonstration purposes. A reproduction of a photograph, kindly sent to\r\nthe author by Prof. Lehmann, of a slide of this substance is given in\r\nFig. 104, Plate XXII. It shows a characteristic field of such drops,\r\nexhibiting white parts and yellow sectorial parts which photograph dark,\r\nof para-azoxy-anisol mixed with a little para-azoxy-phenetol, oil and\r\nresin (colophony), as seen under the polarising microscope with crossed\r\nNicols.\r\n\r\nThe next and possibly most interesting step in this remarkable series of\r\ndiscoveries was made by Lehmann himself in the year 1894. He alighted on\r\nthe fact that ammonium oleate, crystallised from solution in alcohol,\r\naffords a splendid example of flowing crystals, which are sufficiently\r\nlarge to enable their habits to be studied in detail. The individuals\r\nare almost invisible in ordinary light, owing to the refractive index of\r\nthe crystals and of the mother liquor being approximately the same. But\r\nin polarised light, using crossed Nicols, they are clearly revealed as\r\nsteep double pyramids with more or less rounded edges. Their section is\r\nnearly circular in consequence, and they exhibit optical properties of a\r\nuniaxial character, the optic axis being that of the double cone or\r\nbipyramid. A characteristic individual is shown at _e_ in Fig. 105. When\r\ntwo of these flowing crystals approach each other, as at _a_ in Fig.\r\n105, they coalesce to form a larger single individual, as is indicated\r\nin stages at _b_, _c_, and _d_ in the illustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 105.—Liquid Crystals of Ammonium Oleate.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the cover-glass, under which they are growing on a microscope 3 by\r\n1 inch slip, is moved to and fro so as to distort these remarkable\r\nbodies, which we may well hesitate to call crystals, the singular effect\r\nis produced of causing them all to become similarly orientated, for the\r\nextinction directions follow the direction of the pressure. They at once\r\nseek to regain their original form, however, on cessation of the\r\ndisturbance. A slide of the bipyramids under pressure is shown in Fig.\r\n106. In the black extinguished portions of the field the flowing\r\ncrystals are flattened, according to Lehmann, and arranged so that the\r\noptic axis is in all cases perpendicular to the tabular crystals and the\r\nglass plates and parallel to the axis of the microscope. The black parts\r\nare separated by oily strips, as shown in another slide under\r\nconsiderable pressure, represented in Fig. 107, which are composed of\r\nthe tabular crystals standing on end, with their optic axes parallel to\r\nthe plates. These strips polarise the more brightly the more truly the\r\ncrystals stand perpendicularly to the plates. The two conditions are\r\nshown diagrammatically at _a_ and _b_ in Fig. 108.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 106.—Liquid Crystals of Ammonium Oleate under slight pressure.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 107.—Ammonium Oleate under considerable pressure.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 108.—Diagrammatic Representation of Arrangement of Molecules.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLehmann believes the explanation of these singular phenomena to be that\r\nthe “liquid crystals” of ammonium oleate are composed of piles or layers\r\nof thin plates perpendicular to the optic axis. Disturbance detaches the\r\nplates from their piled positions over one another, and sets them\r\nparallel to the glass plate, except in places, the oily strips, where\r\nthe plates stand upright, perpendicularly to the micro-slip and\r\ncover-glass. Lehmann, indeed, goes further, and asserts that the\r\nmolecules themselves are anisotropic, and probably take the form of\r\nplates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 109.—A Crystal of Ammonium Oleate A, broken at B, each part\r\n    repairing itself at C, perfect again at D.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAn extremely interesting experimental observation of Lehmann’s with the\r\nbipyramids of ammonium oleate is, that if one of them, for instance A in\r\nFig. 109, be broken into two parts, as at B, each part grows again and\r\ncompletely repairs itself, becoming once more a perfect double pyramid,\r\nas indicated in stages at C and D in the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 110.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 111.\r\n\r\n  Cruciform, Boomerang, and Arrow-head Twins of Ammonium Oleate.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XXII._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 104.\r\n\r\n  Dichroic Crystal Drops of Para-azoxy-anisol.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 112.\r\n\r\n  Rectilinear Liquid Prisms of Para-azoxy-benzoic Acid.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 115.—Tetragonal Astatic Magnet-system.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 116.—Cubic Astatic Magnet-system.\r\n]\r\n\r\nTwins of ammonium oleate are also shown in Figs. 110 and 111, the former\r\nfigure representing a twin of cruciform character, and the latter\r\nexhibiting twins resembling a boomerang and an arrowhead respectively.\r\n\r\nThis substance, ammonium oleate, thus appears to be one of the most\r\nremarkable and interesting of all the bodies yet observed to afford\r\nliquid crystals. Many other oleates produce liquid crystals also, but\r\nthe ammonium salt is by far the most striking, and very convincing as to\r\nthe reality of Lehmann’s discovery.\r\n\r\nAnother substance of a different nature was discovered by Vorländer in\r\nthe year 1904, namely, the ethyl ester of para-azoxy-benzoic acid. A\r\ncharacteristic microscope slide of it in ordinary light is shown in Fig.\r\n112, Plate XXII., which is a reproduction of an actual photograph most\r\ngenerously sent to the author by Prof. Lehmann.\r\n\r\nThe individuals are described by Lehmann, who further studied the nature\r\nof the substance, as almost perfectly rectilinear prisms with nearly\r\nsharply defined basal plane end faces. A singular fact about this\r\nsubstance is, that when two individuals approach each other they arrange\r\nthemselves parallel with a jerk, and then flow into each other,\r\nproducing a single larger liquid crystal, and often with such rapidity\r\nthat the eye can scarcely follow the movements. These coalescences\r\nappear to be occurring all over the field at once, with the production\r\nof larger and larger crystals. Indeed, Lehmann likens it to a struggle\r\nbetween the innumerable individuals, in which the smaller ones are being\r\ncontinually eaten up by the larger.\r\n\r\nVorländer also prepared the ethyl ester of para-azoxy-cinnamic acid, and\r\nLehmann found it to be similarly interesting. The substance separates\r\nfrom a solution in monobromonaphthalene in uniaxial prisms or\r\nhemimorphic pyramids, the edges and solid angles of which are more or\r\nless rounded, and which appear colourless in the direction of the axis\r\nand yellow in all other directions. When pressed between the cover-glass\r\nand the micro-slip on which the crystallisation is proceeding,\r\nextinction of the light occurs throughout the whole mass when polarised\r\nlight is being employed and the Nicols are crossed. For throughout the\r\nentire substance the particles—whether they are the molecules themselves\r\nas Lehmann asserts or aggregations of them in the form of\r\nultramicroscopic crystals—arrange themselves with their optic axes (the\r\ncrystals being uniaxial) perpendicular to the cover-glass and\r\nmicro-slip, as in the case of ammonium oleate. Lehmann’s theory is that\r\nthe molecules themselves are tabular perpendicular to the axis, as in\r\nthe case just referred to, and that they are thus readily coerced by the\r\npressure of the flat cover-glass to take up positions parallel to it.\r\n\r\nTwo further reproductions of photographs, taken in polarised light, of a\r\nsomewhat remarkable character, which have been placed at the author’s\r\ndisposal by the courtesy of Prof. Lehmann, are given in Figs. 113 and\r\n114, Plate XXIII. Fig. 113 represents numerous doubly refractive and\r\ndichroic strips marking the boundaries of elongated individual crystals\r\nof the substance dibenzal benzidine, and affords a graphic idea of the\r\nreal character of the double refraction displayed by liquid crystals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XXIII._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 113.—Elongated Liquid Crystals of Dibenzal Benzidine, showing\r\n    Double Refraction and Dichroism.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 114.—Spherical Liquid Crystals of Para-azoxy-anisol, showing\r\n    Interference Colours under Crossed Nicols as the Effect of\r\n    Compression.\r\n]\r\n\r\nFig. 114 represents the effect of compression on para-azoxy-anisol, and\r\ndemonstrates very clearly the distribution of the interference colours\r\ndue to double refraction.\r\n\r\nWe are thus face to face in these remarkable experiments with some new\r\nfacts concerning the nature of crystals. For we pass here into the\r\nborderland between ordinary liquids—singly refractive and structureless,\r\nin which the molecules are rolling over each other with every possible\r\norientation—and solid true crystals possessing homogeneous structure,\r\nand the basis of which is a space-lattice arrangement of the chemical\r\nmolecules, determinative of the system of symmetry displayed. In this\r\nwonderful borderland we certainly have had revealed to us, by the genius\r\nand persistency of Lehmann, liquids which possess many of the attributes\r\nof crystals, such as definite orientation of the ultimate particles,\r\ndouble refraction, and optic axes. These are undoubtedly solid facts\r\nwhich require to be faced.\r\n\r\nWhether Lehmann’s theory is to be accepted in full can only be decided\r\nafter much more investigation by several independent investigators. We\r\nare now becoming familiar with the phenomena, as they have naturally\r\nexcited immense interest in all scientific circles, and demonstrations\r\nof many of the experiments of Lehmann have been given in this country by\r\nDr. Miers, Prof. Pope, and others, and particularly by Messrs Zeiss,\r\nwith their new high temperature microscope, a description of the use of\r\nwhich for the projection of liquid crystals on the screen will presently\r\nbe given. Prof. Lehmann himself has described the phenomena so clearly\r\nand fully that it is quite easy for others to repeat his experiments,\r\nand doubtless time would often be much better spent in doing so than in\r\ncriticising points of theory without observing the phenomena at first\r\nhand. It frequently happens, in the inevitable march of scientific\r\nprogress, that striking new facts, such for instance as the discovery of\r\nthe composite nature of the chemical atom, are apt to cause either\r\nalarm, even panic, as to cherished theories, or else unreasoning\r\nscepticism. The happy mean between these two modes of receiving such\r\nfacts, the open philosophic mind, ever ready to widen the scope of the\r\nhorizon when a novel supposition is indubitably proved to be a real\r\nfact, and to assimilate that truth into the theory, widening\r\ncorrespondingly the scope of the latter if needful, is obviously the\r\nideal thing to cultivate, and one which eventually finds itself in\r\nharmony with the authenticated final results of the new discoveries. It\r\nusually happens that too sweeping conclusions are at first drawn from\r\nsuch new facts, but time, with its further wealth of experience,\r\nespecially the accumulation of experimental _data_ which it brings in\r\nits train, soon levels these down and relegates the facts to their\r\nproper positions in the great scheme of natural knowledge.\r\n\r\nLehmann’s view is that the ordinary effect of surface tension to cause\r\ntruly liquid particles to assume the spherical “drop” form is resisted\r\nby a special force, which he terms “Gestaltungskraft,” and which we may\r\nperhaps translate “Configuration-determining force.” This force he\r\nconsiders is not identical with that of elasticity, but is that force by\r\nvirtue of which a “flowing crystal” continually seeks, while freely\r\nswimming in the mother liquor or fused liquid, to take up its normal\r\nconfiguration. Even if a spherical drop could be cut out of it, the\r\nsphere would at once become a rod, prism, or pyramid or whatever the\r\nnormal configuration of the flowing crystals of the substance in\r\nquestion might be.\r\n\r\nThe much debated term “liquid crystal” has been given by Lehmann to the\r\nnormal configuration of each of the now considerable number of\r\nsubstances which have been discovered to exhibit the phenomena of\r\nflowing crystals. The latter appellation “flowing crystal,” which\r\nLehmann also uses, appears to the author to be in many ways more\r\nsuitable, however, and would avoid much of the criticism which has been\r\nlevelled at the term “liquid crystal.”\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, Lehmann attributes the whole phenomena to a\r\nfundamental cause, namely, anisotropy (optical dissimilarity in\r\ndifferent directions) of the molecules themselves, which he considers\r\nmust cause self-restoration of the structure after disturbance, a\r\nprocess which he terms “spontaneous homœotropy.” He considers that it is\r\nthe molecular configuration-producing force, connected with the tabular\r\nform of, and directionally differentiated distribution of energy and\r\nforce in, the single chemical molecules, which maintains the inner\r\nstructure of the flowing crystal in position. The polyhedral outward\r\nform thus appears to be a necessary consequence of the inner structure,\r\non this basis that it is a force resident in the molecules themselves\r\nwhich produces the structure.\r\n\r\nNow the revelation of new facts, as startling as those which are now\r\nexperimentally fully confirmed concerning flowing crystals, must\r\ninevitably cause searching reflection as to whether the magnificent\r\ngeometrical work on the 230 homogeneous structures, and their\r\ndevelopment in actual fact in the 32 classes of crystals, is to stand or\r\nto be seriously affected. Again the author ventures to express the\r\nopinion, that just what happened in regard to the historic differences\r\nbetween the schools of Haüy and Mitscherlich, will in all probability\r\nagain occur, namely, both extreme views will be shown to depend more or\r\nless on real facts, and other connecting facts will eventually be\r\nrevealed which will completely reconcile the two series with each other.\r\nIn the author’s opinion, the geometrical work will stand, as the grand\r\ngeneralisation it really is. But it will be interpreted in the future\r\nwithout the somewhat arbitrary assumptions which have more or less\r\naccompanied it. From these it will be freed, and then rise purified and\r\nelevated to its real dominating position in regard to crystal\r\nmorphology.\r\n\r\nLehmann, with the natural enthusiasm of the discoverer of one of the\r\nmost remarkable facts for which the last few decades have been famous,\r\nmay have carried his theory too far, and particularly in that part of\r\nhis work, to which the author has not hitherto referred, in which he\r\ndescribes certain phenomena of flowing crystals as akin to the movement\r\nof living organisms such as bacteria, and thus brought even some of the\r\nsound facts under the criticism of the sceptic more than might otherwise\r\nhave been the case. He may also have made his theory far more\r\nrevolutionary than is essential. But the one incontrovertible thing\r\nstands out plainly, namely, that the “flowing crystals” with which he\r\nhas made us acquainted are an indubitable experimental fact. Flowing\r\ncrystals are produced, however, by a relatively few substances of very\r\ncomplex molecular constitution, involving a large number of atoms in the\r\nmolecule; they are mostly compounds of carbon, and in number possibly\r\nnot one per cent. of the innumerable substances known to produce\r\nordinary solid crystals. That the theory of crystal structure can\r\neventually be made to include these few remarkable substances is highly\r\nprobable, when many more facts have been accumulated.\r\n\r\nLehmann would appear to have made one point very clear, which at once\r\nremoves an objection long felt by the author to the theory of crystal\r\nstructure as it stands at present, namely, that the chemical molecule is\r\nendowed with a directive orientative force, which is certainly concerned\r\nin crystallisation. To assume, as has been done, just because it is not\r\nnecessary from the point of view of the geometrician in developing his\r\npossible homogeneous structures, that no directive force is operative in\r\ncrystallisation, and that all is a mere question of the most convenient\r\nmechanical packing of the molecules, is, in the author’s opinion, going\r\nbeyond what the experimental facts justify. If Lehmann’s discovery of\r\nflowing crystals does nothing more than return to the molecule the\r\nproperty always hitherto attributed to it, of possessing in itself some\r\ndirective force by reason of which it arranges itself homogeneously by\r\nmutual accommodation with its similarly endowed fellow molecules, when\r\nits motion in the liquid state has been sufficiently arrested by its\r\napproach to its fellows within the range of molecular action (four or\r\nfive molecular diameters), either by cooling or the falling out of\r\npreviously separating solvent molecules, it will have achieved a notable\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nWhat does occur at the moment of crystallisation is at the present time\r\none of the most interesting unsolved questions in crystallography, and\r\none calling most urgently for solution. Attention was directed to the\r\nproblem in the last chapter, in connection with the suggestive work of\r\nMiers on vicinal faces. It was shown that it was only when the directive\r\nforce had time to come properly into operation that the primary faces of\r\nfundamental importance were produced, and that when the crystallisation\r\nwas rapid vicinal faces formed instead. Lehmann believes that a single\r\nkind of chemical molecule is only capable of producing a single specific\r\nspace-lattice, and that polymorphism is due to alteration of the\r\nmolecules themselves at the critical temperature of transformation. He\r\nshowed so far back as 1872 that this limit could be actually observed\r\nunder the microscope, as a definite line of demarcation between the two\r\nvarieties as the temperature fell, one side of the field attaining the\r\ncritical temperature slightly before the other, and the defining line\r\nbetween the two kinds thus travelling over the field. Internal friction\r\ndid not appear to Lehmann to enter into the question at all, as he\r\nconsidered it would have done if a rearrangement of the molecules were\r\nthe sole cause of the change. The molecules themselves, he states, must\r\nhave been undergoing change, and such rearrangement of them as occurred\r\nmust have been due to that fact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  _PLATE XXIV._\r\n\r\n  FIG. 117.—Arrangement of Astatic Magnet-systems in a Plane.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 118.—Arrangement of Astatic Magnet-systems in Space.\r\n]\r\n\r\nLehmann suggests a very interesting explanation of the molecular\r\norientative force of configuration, namely, that it is due to the action\r\nof the electronic corpuscles (forming the elementary atoms) rotating in\r\nthe molecule. For the molecules of flowing crystals behave like freely\r\nsuspended astatic systems of magnets, which are constantly setting\r\nthemselves, even while moving about, in a crystalline space-lattice. He\r\nsuggests that the molecules are really magnets the poles of which\r\nmutually attract and repel one another; that two equal magnetic\r\nmolecules are arranged alongside with opposite poles against each other,\r\nthus mutually binding each other, or that four horse-shoe magnets may be\r\narranged with opposite poles together, in a tetragonal astatic system,\r\nas shown in Fig. 115, Plate XXII. The latter may be grouped in space in\r\na cubic astatic system, as represented in Fig. 116 on the same Plate;\r\nwhile Figs. 117 and 118, Plate XXIV., are further suggestive of how a\r\nhomogeneous structure of such astatically distributed molecules can be\r\nbuilt up, Fig. 117 representing a single plane of them, and Fig. 118 the\r\ncomplete arrangement in space.\r\n\r\nAn astatic system of molecules of this nature would have lost all power\r\nof attraction by a magnet, and the fact would thus be accounted for that\r\nno striking crystallographic results have ever attended experiments on\r\ncrystallisation in a magnetic field. Astatic systems, however, such as\r\nthat shown in Fig. 115, would certainly arrange themselves in\r\nspace-lattices. For such parallel arrangements would, in general,\r\ninvolve differences in different directions, with regard both to\r\ninternal friction and to the power of thermal expansion and of such\r\nregular dilatational or other deformational changes as we know are\r\nprovoked by different physical conditions of environment. These\r\ndifferences would naturally, in turn, give rise to external polyhedral\r\nform.\r\n\r\nLehmann then goes on to point out that either electric currents or\r\nmechanically moved quantities of electricity, such as moving negative\r\nelectronic corpuscles, can give rise to just such magnetic effects, and\r\nhe suggests that these corpuscles are the true cause. He supposes that\r\nthe directive forces result in astatic combinations which find their\r\nequilibrium when the latter have taken up their positions at the eight\r\ncorners of a cube or other elementary parallelepipedon of one of the\r\nfourteen possible space-lattices, the positive atoms being encircled\r\nspiral-wise by the negative electronic corpuscles in alternately\r\nopposite directions. Such parallelepipeda would seek homogeneous\r\nrepetition by virtue of the fact of the corners exhibiting alternating\r\npolarity.\r\n\r\nThese theoretical ideas of Lehmann have naturally called forth much\r\ndiscussion, criticism, and scepticism. But, so far, his experimental\r\nfacts have been fully substantiated by further investigation. Much more\r\npractical work is urgently required, however, before the subject can be\r\nconsidered as laid on a secure foundation. So much may be said, however,\r\nthat it is clear that we must concede the existence of a directive force\r\nof crystallisation, and not be led by the pure geometry of the subject\r\nof crystal structure to ignore facts of such interest and undoubted\r\nimportance as have been brought into prominence by the remarkable work\r\nof Lehmann.\r\n\r\nA further interesting contribution has recently been made by\r\nVorländer[27] to the facts regarding the relationship between chemical\r\nconstitution and the formation of liquid crystals. It must have already\r\nstruck the reader that most of the substances which exhibit liquid\r\ncrystals are composed of a large number of chemical atoms, being either\r\nlong-chain compounds of the fatty acids or complex derivatives of the\r\nhydrocarbon benzene, C_{6}H_{6}; also that many of the latter are “para”\r\ncompounds, that is, derivatives in which the substitution groups are\r\ninserted in the benzene ring of six carbon atoms in the “para” position,\r\nwhich is that at the opposite corner of the hexagon to the carbon atom\r\nto which a substitution group has already been attached. This renders\r\nthe para compounds the most extended in a straight line of all the\r\nbenzene derivatives. Now Vorländer finds that a particularly favourable\r\ncondition for the production of liquid crystals is a linear structure of\r\nthe molecule. As the para substitution products of benzene derivatives\r\npossess this elongated structure, many of them exhibit the development\r\nof liquid crystals. The more linearly extended the structure becomes,\r\nthat is, the longer the straight chain of atoms is, the more favourable\r\nbecome the conditions. The advent of a third substitution group,\r\nhowever, which would have the effect of producing a kink in the chain,\r\nor of bending it, appears to destroy the possibility of the production\r\nof liquid crystals. This interesting observation may afford the key to\r\nmany of the extraordinary phenomena of liquid crystals which have been\r\ndescribed, and is undoubtedly one of prime importance. Further\r\nfavourable conditions for the formation of liquid crystals, according to\r\nVorländer,[28] are the aromatic character, and the presence of the\r\ndoubly-linked carbon and nitrogen groups C:C, C:N, and N:N, which are\r\nusually so rich in energy.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the formation of a specific crystalline homogeneous\r\nstructure, merely because the mechanical fitting-in of the molecules\r\noccurs with the minimum of trouble or maximum of ease for this\r\nparticular type of all the 230 possible types, is certainly not\r\napplicable to the case of Lehmann’s liquid crystals. With this,\r\nmoreover, is also connected the question of softness or hardness of\r\ncrystals, which was referred to at the opening of this chapter. For the\r\nso-called liquid crystals are extreme cases of softness, and yet in\r\nthese cases the molecules must still be arranged in accordance with the\r\ninternal structure of a crystal, either parallel or enantiomorphously\r\ndefinitely orientated with respect to each other, for otherwise it is\r\nnot possible to account for the optical properties resembling the\r\norientated ones of a crystal. Yet the condition being that of a liquid,\r\nthe molecules must be able readily to pass and roll over each other, and\r\nhence cannot be at the close quarters where mere “fitting-in” comes into\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nAgain, as has been pointed out earlier, many soft crystals, even such as\r\ncalcite, which are only relatively soft, attaining the position of as\r\nmuch as four in the scale of hardness, readily exhibit the property of\r\nbeing deformable upon glide-planes. The molecules in these cases have\r\nbeen shown to undergo a movement which has two components, a\r\ntransference and a rotation, a fact which has been thoroughly\r\nsubstantiated by optical investigations of the parts of the crystal\r\nconcerned before and after gliding. There cannot, therefore, have been\r\nmerely “fitting-in” of the molecules, but their orientated positions\r\nmust have been determined and maintained by the organising force, which\r\nis probably purely physical and not chemical, but is nevertheless the\r\ncause of crystallisation; it draws the molecules within a certain range\r\nof each other, corresponding to and dependent upon the temperature,\r\ncauses or enables them to arrange themselves in the marshalled order of\r\nthe particular type among the 230 possible arrangements, and keeps them\r\nat the same time from approaching nearer to each other than within these\r\nprescribed limits corresponding to the temperature. It is doubtless\r\nwithin these limits that gliding can occur parallel to such planes as\r\nleave the molecules most room for the purpose, and which are directions\r\nof least resistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 119.—Lehmann’s Crystallisation Microscope arranged for\r\n    Projection.\r\n]\r\n\r\nConnected with this important question is the principle enunciated by\r\nBravais, as a result of his discovery of the space-lattice, that\r\ncleavage occurs most readily parallel to those net-planes of the\r\nspace-lattice which are most densely strewn with points. The force just\r\nreferred to, whether we term it cohesion or otherwise, is obviously at a\r\nmaximum within such a plane, and at a minimum in the perpendicular\r\ndirection where the points are further off from each other. Moreover, it\r\nhas been fairly well proved also, from the experiments of Wulff,\r\ndescribed in the last chapter, that the direction or directions of\r\nmaximum cohesion are those of slowest growth of the crystal; so that\r\nfaces parallel to those directions become relatively more extended owing\r\nto the more rapid growth of other faces on their boundaries, and thus\r\nbecome the most largely developed and confer the “habit” on the crystal.\r\nAll these are facts so important as evidences of a controlling force at\r\nwork in crystallisation, that a _purely_ geometrical theory of the\r\nformation of crystals which would make “facility of fitting-in” of the\r\nmolecular particles its chief tenet, obviously does not tell us the\r\ncomplete story. Hence the author desires to utter a warning against\r\ngoing too far with the pure geometry of the subject. The geometricians\r\nhave done a grand work in providing us with the thoroughly well\r\nestablished 230 types of homogeneous structures, as a full and final\r\nexplanation of the 32 classes of crystals, and so far their results are\r\nwholly and unreservedly acceptable.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of “liquid crystals” lend themselves admirably to screen\r\ndemonstration, for which purpose an excellent improved form of the\r\ncrystallisation microscope of Lehmann, shown in Fig. 119, is constructed\r\nby Zeiss, and its actual use in the projection, with the aid of the\r\nwell-known Zeiss electric lantern, but specially fitted for the purpose,\r\nis shown in Fig. 120.\r\n\r\nA magnification of 600–700 diameters on the screen is very suitable,\r\nemploying a Zeiss 8–millimetre objective without eyepiece. This\r\nobjective affords directly a magnification of 30 diameters. For ordinary\r\neye observation an eyepiece magnifying 6–8 times is added, thus\r\naffording to the eye a magnification of about 200 diameters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FIG. 120.—Zeiss Apparatus for the Projection of Liquid Crystals.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe lantern is supplied with a self-feeding electric arc lamp, ensuring\r\na steady light. A collective lens of extra light-gathering power is\r\nfitted in front as condenser, and from it proceeds a light-tight tube\r\nprovided with a water cell to filter out most of the heat rays which\r\naccompany the light. The electric lantern with Brockie-Pell or Oliver\r\nself-feeding arc lamp, shown in Figs. 71 and 79 (pages 186 and 202), is\r\nalso equally suitable, and with the water cell, and parallelising\r\nconcave lens removed from the large Nicol polariser, affords a parallel\r\nbeam of the same character as the Zeiss apparatus. The microscope stands\r\non a sole plate provided with levelling screws, and is naturally\r\nemployed in the vertical position for such work with fused substances. A\r\nmirror inclined at 45° at the foot of the microscope directs the\r\nparallelised rays from the optical lantern through the microscope, and\r\nanother above the optical tube reflects them to the screen.\r\n\r\nThe heating apparatus consists of a form of miniature Bunsen burner\r\nfitted with blowpipe blast, the respective pressures of gas and air\r\nbeing regulated by means of two taps with graduated arcs for obtaining\r\ngreater delicacy of adjustment. The tabular plate seen to the left in\r\nFig. 119 is the graduated semi-circle of the two taps; below it is seen\r\nthe cylindrical mixing chamber for gas and air, in the event of the\r\nnecessity for using the Bunsen as a blowpipe. There are two separate\r\nattachments for indiarubber tubes to this cylinder, conveying\r\nrespectively gas and air. Above the object stage a double air-blast is\r\nfitted, each tube of which is hinged with a universal joint, so that it\r\ncan be readily adjusted to any desired position on either side of and\r\nabove the glass plate (supported on little metallic uprights) on which\r\nthe experiment is being conducted. A polarising Nicol prism and an\r\nanalysing Nicol, both constructed in a manner which protects them from\r\nthe effects of heat more effectually than is the case with the usual\r\nform, are provided for obtaining the projections in polarised light. The\r\nobjective and analysing Nicol, as well as the substage condenser, are\r\nalso specially protected from injury by heat, by being surrounded with a\r\nwater jacket, supplied with running water, and a disc-like screen just\r\nabove the objective assists in deflecting the heat rays from the optical\r\ntube and its Bertrand lens and other usual fittings. The miniature\r\nBunsen flame is usually brought about an inch below the object-plate,\r\nand the size of the flame can be regulated with the utmost precision, so\r\nthat a fairly constant temperature can be obtained for a considerable\r\ntime. With the aid of the blowpipe air-blast temperatures up to 700° C.\r\ncan be safely employed.\r\n\r\nThe microscope shown in position on the projection apparatus in Fig. 120\r\nis a still more recent form introduced by Zeiss, embodying several\r\nfurther conveniences and improvements.\r\n\r\nThe following substances lend themselves particularly well to projection\r\npurposes. Para-azoxy-anisol with resin, which exhibits the phenomenon of\r\nrotating drops; cholesteryl acetate, which affords a fine example of\r\nspherical liquid crystals; paraazoxy-phenetol with resin, which gives\r\nbeautiful interference colours; and the acetyl ester of\r\npara-azoxy-benzoic acid with resin, which shows the uniting of crystals\r\nto form larger and larger individuals.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most interesting and beautiful of all is cholesteryl\r\nacetate, a characteristic field of which is shown in Fig. 121 on Plate\r\nXVI., facing page 208. It is interesting that on this Plate XVI. there\r\nare represented the very hardest and the softest of crystals, namely,\r\ndiamonds and liquid crystals. In order to obtain the finest effect the\r\nheating and cooling should be carried out very slowly. The little Bunsen\r\nburner, with a very minute flame, is first placed under the slide, and\r\nallowed to act until the substance melts and forms a clear liquid. The\r\ngas jet is then removed and the air-blasts, both of which are\r\nsimultaneously actuated when the tap controlling them is turned, are\r\nvery gently brought into operation, one on each side of the centre of\r\nthe slide, there being a good working distance of a quarter of an inch\r\nor more between the slide and the objective. The cooling is thus brought\r\nabout very slowly. The Nicols should be crossed, and at this time the\r\nfield is quite dark, the liquid substance being at this temperature\r\n(well above 114.5° the ordinary melting point) an ordinary singly\r\nrefractive liquid.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the temperature has become reduced to that at which the\r\nparticular modification of cholesteryl acetate is produced which forms\r\nliquid crystals, spots of light make their appearance at various points\r\nin the field, and each expands into a beautiful circular and more or\r\nless coloured disc marked by a rectangular sectorial black cross, which\r\nlatter is well shown in the illustration (Fig. 121). These beautiful\r\napparitions continue to occur, and each to expand to a certain size,\r\nwhich is rarely exceeded, until the whole field becomes filled with the\r\nwheels or crossed discs, the general effect very much in some respects\r\nresembling that afforded by a slide of the well-known polarising\r\nsubstance salicine. These discs, however, are liquid, being spherical\r\ndrops, of the structure already described and illustrated in Fig. 103,\r\nand that this is so is at once made apparent on touching the cover-glass\r\nwith a pen-knife or other hard pointed substance, which immediately\r\ncauses them to become distorted. They recover instantly their shape\r\nagain when the pressure is removed. When the cooling, moreover, has\r\nproceeded still further, there is a sudden change, and acicular solid\r\ncrystals shoot over the screen, tinted with all the colours of the\r\nspectrum, until the field is full of them, the ordinary solid\r\nmodification of the substance having then been produced. The experiment\r\nmay be repeated with the same specimen of the substance, mounted on the\r\nsame slide, covered with the usual thin cover-glass, time after time for\r\nmonths, at reasonable intervals.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this chapter it may be mentioned that absolute proof of\r\nthe double refraction of the liquid crystals of several different\r\nsubstances, derivatives of cinnamic acid, has been afforded during the\r\nyear 1910. For direct measurements have been carried out by two\r\nindependent investigators, Dorn and Stumpf, of the two refractive\r\nindices corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary rays in each\r\ncase, the crystals being uniaxial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n  THE CHEMICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF CRYSTALLOGRAPHY. THE THEORY OF POPE AND\r\n                           BARLOW—CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing in connection with the subject of crystallography is more\r\nsurprising than the neglect and apathy with which it has been for long\r\ntreated by the chemical world. That crystalline structure is intimately\r\nrelated to chemical constitution will have been made abundantly plain\r\nduring the course of this book. Yet in spite of the great work of\r\nMitscherlich, essentially a chemist, and of a large amount of striking\r\nwork which has been steadily accumulating during the last thirty years,\r\nwith results of vital importance to chemistry, it is only at the\r\neleventh hour that chemists are really awakening to the vast\r\nsignificance which crystal structure has for them.\r\n\r\nThe explanation undoubtedly is, that the long interregnum of conflicting\r\ninvestigations, doubt, and controversy, which followed the work of Haüy\r\nand Mitscherlich, and preceded the beginning of really accurate and\r\npainstaking investigation of an organised and systematic character, had\r\ncaused chemists to regard with more or less of indifference the work of\r\nthe crystallographers. Added to this we must remember that the subject\r\nof crystallography has hitherto been taught, when taught at all, merely\r\nas an appanage of mineralogy, although the pure chemical substances\r\nwhich crystallise well infinitely outnumber the naturally occurring\r\nminerals, and the results afforded by them frequently possess a much\r\ngreater value by reason of the purity of the substances and their more\r\ndefinite chemical constitution. Also the mathematical and geometrical\r\nside has usually been unduly emphasised, and carried on in lectures\r\nwithout any practical goniometrical work at all. Moreover, the current\r\ntext-books have often proved forbiddingly full of calculations and\r\nformulæ, and of the obsolete and unenticing symbols of Naumann.\r\n\r\nAt last we have come to see that the subject is one of fascinating\r\ninterest when its study is commenced in a practical manner from the\r\nbeginning, armed from the very first lesson with the goniometer. The\r\ncrystal itself is then our main and highly interesting study; its\r\nexterior form unravels itself in a most delightfully simple manner when\r\nwe follow the arrangement of its faces in zones on the goniometer\r\nitself; and its symmetry becomes immediately patent to our eyes in all\r\nordinary simple cases, when we construct for ourselves its plan in a\r\nstereographic projection, drawn at first in freehand while still at the\r\ngoniometer. The calculations also become perfectly simple when we have\r\nlearnt that only the simplest of the very easy formulæ of spherical\r\ntrigonometry are required, and which a knowledge of only elementary\r\nplane trigonometry enables us to apply. Aided by a few very helpful\r\nrules, such as those of Napier for calculating right-angled spherical\r\ntriangles, and the rule of the anharmonic ratio of four poles in a\r\nzone—which, when the positions of three crystal faces of the zone are\r\nknown, at once enables us to calculate the situation of any fourth face\r\nof the zone—we have at once a stock-in-trade which carries us over all\r\ndifficulties in the way of calculation, and relegates this side of the\r\nwork to an altogether subordinate position, although accuracy in\r\ncarrying it out is, of course, absolutely essential and even vital.\r\n\r\nEspecial interest has recently been attracted on the part of chemists to\r\nthe bearing of crystallography on their science by a remarkable theory\r\nwhich has been advanced by Pope and Barlow, connecting the internal\r\nstructure of crystals with chemical valency, the power which the atom of\r\na chemical element possesses of combining with the atoms of other\r\nelements, and which is generally expressed by the number of atoms of a\r\nmonad element, such as hydrogen or chlorine, with which it is capable of\r\ncombining chemically. Thus the electro-positive metal potassium is said\r\nto have monad valency because it is capable of combining with one atom\r\nof the electro-negative element chlorine to form the salt potassium\r\nchloride, KCl; calcium possesses dyad valency because it can unite with\r\ntwo atoms of chlorine to form calcium chloride, CaCl_{2}; aluminium is\r\ntriadic as it can combine with three atoms of chlorine producing\r\naluminium chloride, AlCl_{3}; carbon is a tetrad because it can take up\r\nfour chlorine atoms, forming carbon tetrachloride, CCl_{4}, and\r\nphosphorus a pentad as it can fix five with production of phosphorus\r\npentachloride, PCl_{5}; while sulphur is a hexad because it can take up\r\nas many as six atoms of chlorine, forming sulphur hexachloride, SCl_{6}.\r\n\r\nOccasion has already been taken in Chapter XI. to refer to the able work\r\nof Prof. Pope with regard to optically active carbon compounds, and in\r\nChapter IX. the important contribution of Mr Barlow to the completion of\r\nthe theory of the homogeneous partitioning of space has likewise been\r\ndiscussed. In collaboration these two investigators have now propounded\r\na theory which connects the chemical and geometrical sides of\r\ncrystallography in a somewhat startling manner, which has naturally\r\naroused very considerable discussion, and which, whether right or wrong,\r\ncannot fail to have the best results in attracting investigators to the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nStarting from the facts which have now been laid down in this book as\r\nhaving been firmly established by the most careful measurement and\r\nexperimental investigation—notably the constancy of the interfacial\r\nangles of the crystals of the same substance, the fixed positions of the\r\natoms or their spheres of influence in the molecule and in the crystal,\r\nand the arrangement of the molecules in space-lattices and the atoms in\r\npoint-systems—Pope and Barlow assume that valency, the expression of the\r\nrelative combining power of the chemical elements, is a question of the\r\nsize of the sphere of influence of the atom of an element, and that the\r\nrelative sizes of such spheres of influence determine the modes in which\r\nthey can be packed, that is, the nature of the homogeneous crystal\r\nstructure which they can build up. The theory consequently renders the\r\nchemical phenomenon of valency and the physical phenomenon of\r\ncrystalline form mutually interdependent.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be apparent that the essence of their conception is that\r\nthe chemical molecule may be considered as made up of a number of\r\nspheres corresponding to, and representing, the spheres of influence of\r\nthe atoms composing it, and that the volume of each sphere is roughly\r\nproportional to the valency of the atom which it represents. They then\r\nassume that the sum of the valencies of the atoms present in the\r\nmolecule may be substituted for the molecular volume, and the quantity\r\nthus arrived at is termed by them the “valency volume.” By using the\r\nvalency volume instead of the molecular volume in the author’s formulæ\r\nfor calculating the molecular distance ratios, which have been shown in\r\nChapter X. to afford the relative dimensions of the unit cell of the\r\nspace-lattice, and the distances of separation of the centres of gravity\r\nof the molecules from each other along the directions of the crystal\r\naxes, Pope and Barlow arrive at new ratios, which they term equivalence\r\nparameters. By the use of these latter they have attempted to account\r\nfor the crystalline structure of a number of substances—chiefly organic\r\ncompounds, in the investigation of which Prof. Pope has proved so\r\nadept—which are connected morphotropically in the manner described in\r\nChapter VIII., and of others which are still less intimately connected.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the equivalence parameters do not make clear the\r\nrelationships in an isomorphous series, as do the molecular distance\r\nratios; for they are, from their very nature and mode of derivation,\r\nalmost identical for all the members of an isomorphous series, the\r\nvalencies of the interchangeable elements being the same. The molecular\r\ndistance ratios have also the great advantage of being derived from the\r\nthree measurements which have now been brought to the highest pitch of\r\nexperimental accuracy, namely, atomic weight determinations, density\r\ndeterminations by the Retgers immersion method, and goniometrical and\r\nphysical measurements (optical and thermal) with instruments now\r\navailable of the utmost refinement. Structural constants thus derived\r\nare obviously of especial value. It would thus appear that the theory\r\nrequires modification so as to take account of the experimentally proved\r\nregular increase in volume and in the directional dimensions of the\r\nstructural unit cell of the crystal space-lattice, when one element of\r\nthe same family group and of the same valency is interchanged for\r\nanother. Indeed, as the theory stands at present it entirely ignores and\r\nfails to offer any explanation of the highly important physical property\r\nof density, specific gravity. That this physical constant, and the\r\nequally important constant molecular volume, derived by dividing the\r\nmolecular weight by the density, possess a real and significant meaning\r\nin isomorphous series, formed by the interchange of elements of the same\r\nfamily group, has been clearly proved in Chapter X. This fact is,\r\nindeed, so obvious that any further development of the theory must of\r\nnecessity take account of it.\r\n\r\nA precise statement of their conception has recently been made by Prof.\r\nPope in an excellent Report on the Progress of Crystallography, issued\r\nby the Chemical Society early in the year 1909. He states that they\r\n(Pope and Barlow) “regard the whole of the volume occupied by a\r\ncrystalline structure as partitioned out into polyhedra, which lie\r\npacked together in such a manner as to fill the whole of that volume\r\nwithout interstices. The polyhedra can be so selected that each\r\nrepresents the habitat of one component atom of the material, and are\r\ntermed the spheres of atomic influence of the constituent atoms. Up to\r\nthis point no assumption is made other than that clearly indicated by\r\nthe result of crystallographic measurements, namely, that each atom\r\npresent in a crystalline structure exerts a distinct morphological\r\neffect—or, what is the same thing, appropriates a certain definite\r\nvolume. The assumption is next made that the crystalline structure,\r\nwhich is resolvable into individual molecules and ultimately into\r\nindividual atoms, exists as such by reason of equilibrium set up between\r\nopposing attractive and repulsive forces operating between the component\r\natoms, and that this equilibrium results in the polyhedra representing\r\nthe spheres of atomic influence assuming shapes which are as nearly as\r\npossible spherical.... The polyhedra thus arrived at may be regarded as\r\nderived by compression of a close-packed assemblage of deformable,\r\nincompressible elastic spheres,[29] the compression sufficing for the\r\npractical extinction of the interstitial space. When such an assemblage\r\nis released from pressure it is evident that in place of polyhedra, the\r\nshapes of which approximate as closely as possible to the spherical,\r\nclosely packed spheres are presented; the distances between the sphere\r\ncentres can be substantially in the same ratios as the distances between\r\nthe centres of the corresponding polyhedra in the unexpanded mass, and\r\nthe equilibrium condition of maximum sphericity of the polyhedra will be\r\npresented in the expanded mass of spheres by the existence of the\r\nmaximum number of contacts between spheres. The whole method of treating\r\nthe primary assumption thus resolves itself into finding close-packed\r\nassemblages of spheres of various sizes representing by their relative\r\nvolumes the spheres of influence of the component atoms of any\r\nparticular crystalline structure.”\r\n\r\nSome very interesting evidence of the validity of their fundamental\r\nassumption of spheres of influence of the component atoms as the\r\nultimate structural units is brought forward. They show that there are\r\ntwo modes of closely packing equal spheres, which give rise respectively\r\nto a cubic and a hexagonal crystal structure, the latter having a\r\nspecific axial ratio of the vertical to the three equal equatorial\r\nhorizontal axes; and that the chemical elements which are solids and\r\ncrystallise, and the structural units of which can naturally be assumed\r\nto be equal spheres, being those of the similar atoms of the same\r\nchemical element, do practically all crystallise either in the cubic\r\nsystem or in the hexagonal system with the specific axial ratio\r\nindicated by them. The theory as it concerns chemical valency is\r\nobviously not affected by these interesting facts, as the spheres of\r\ninfluence present are those of the identically similar atoms of the same\r\nelement. But the theory has received considerable support from the\r\nresults of the investigation of a number of carbon compounds, chiefly\r\nderivatives of benzene.\r\n\r\nThus, in spite of the very wise decision of Barlow at the time of\r\ndeveloping his theory of the homogeneous partitioning of space, to keep\r\nquite clear of attributing shape to the structural unit atoms or\r\nmolecules, and to consider them as points, he, in common with the other\r\ncontributors to that splendid geometrical work, appears driven to\r\nconsider the question of shape when, in collaboration with his chemical\r\ncolleague, he endeavours to apply his geometrical results to the\r\npractical problems of chemistry. It may be inevitable that we cannot get\r\naway from the idea of shape of the fundamental structural units. Yet the\r\nmoment we do admit the idea, and begin to talk of polyhedra, or even of\r\nspheres, in close or any other packing, we enter the debatable land,\r\nconcerning which the experimental evidence is as yet but shadowy and\r\nliable to many interpretations. Hence it is that we have the\r\nparallelohedra of Von Fedorow, having volumes proportional to the\r\nmolecular volumes, the more general plane-faced cell of fourteen faces,\r\nthe tetrakaidecahedron of Lord Kelvin and its deformed derivatives, and\r\nnow the polyhedra of Pope and Barlow. The more indefinite\r\n“Fundamentalbereich” of Schönflies appears to be left behind, and we\r\nhave embarked on a definite course of attributing shape to the component\r\natoms or their regions of influence in the crystal structure. Von\r\nFedorow has developed his particular theory in a very masterly manner,\r\nand with the aid of it professes, and with very considerable success in\r\nmany cases, to determine the correct mode of setting up a crystal for\r\ntruly comparative descriptive purposes, and has derived therefrom a\r\nremarkable method of crystallochemical analysis.\r\n\r\nMoreover, there is yet another view, that of Sollas,[30] that the\r\npacking of the molecules is a more open one altogether, a view to which\r\nhe has been guided by consideration of the molecular volume. Sollas has\r\noffered some remarkable explanations of crystal structure, notably in\r\nthe case of the dimorphous forms of silver iodide. The abnormal\r\ncontraction which occurs on heating this interesting substance, and its\r\nsudden transformation at 146° from the ordinary hexagonal into a cubic\r\nmodification as discovered by Lehmann, appear capable of very clear\r\nexplanation on the basis of his theory. According to this theory of\r\nSollas the volumes of the spheres of influence of the atoms of the\r\ndifferent elements of the same family group, such as those of the group\r\nof alkali metals or those of the halogens, chlorine, bromine, and\r\niodine, vary progressively in a manner which is dependent on the atomic\r\nvolumes of the elements, which have a real comparative significance when\r\nthe elements belong to the same family group.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that there is a considerable substratum of truth behind\r\nthese various apparently conflicting views, and what is now required is\r\nthat the germ of real fact shall be winnowed from the husk of fallacious\r\nspeculation, just as occurred in the happy recent settlement of the old\r\nissue between Haüy and Mitscherlich. As in that case, moreover, it will\r\nbe experimental work of superlative accuracy which can alone offer the\r\ndesirable evidence on which a satisfactory arbitration can be founded.\r\n\r\nIt is thus obvious that we have now arrived at a stage in the history of\r\ncrystallography when more experimental data, and many more measurements\r\nof the most carefully conducted character, on pure materials and\r\nexcellently developed crystals, are most urgently needed, in order to\r\ndecide these important, indeed fundamental, questions, the present state\r\nof which the author has endeavoured to present with judicial\r\nimpartiality. When one looks around, and sees the almost complete lack\r\nof opportunities for the training of investigators in this rapidly\r\ngrowing branch of science, the importance of which to chemistry and\r\nphysics is increasing every day, while the field is ripe for the\r\nharvesters, one is inclined to feel depressed with the thought of the\r\nopportunities which are being lost. Our country has, in this science at\r\nany rate, a fine record, having with few breaks led the van of progress\r\nfrom the time of Wollaston, the inventor in the year 1809 of the\r\nreflecting goniometer, and of Miller, the originator of our method of\r\ndescribing crystals and the pioneer of accurate experimental work, down\r\nto the present day. It may be, also, that our country’s reputation is\r\nsafe at this moment. But it is in the hands of a band of investigators\r\nso small, and often of the private and not professional nature, carrying\r\non the work for sheer love of it and deep interest in it, that the\r\nwonder is that so much has been done, and it is the provision for\r\ncarrying on our national tradition of leadership in crystallography in\r\nthe future that is a matter for the deepest concern.\r\n\r\nIf the perusal of this book should have awakened sufficient interest in\r\nthe minds of some of its readers to prompt them to offer themselves as\r\nrecruits to this small band of investigators, and especially if it\r\nshould have inspired the zeal and enthusiasm of a few young students\r\nlooking around for a promising and fascinating field of work, and,\r\nfinally, if it should prove to be of assistance in obtaining the means\r\nof training such recruits with the help of the best and most accurate\r\nexperimental apparatus which can be obtained, the author’s main objects\r\nin writing it will have been attained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n Airy’s spirals, 197\r\n\r\n Alpine snow-field, 49\r\n\r\n Alum, ammonium iron,
