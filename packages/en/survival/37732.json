Human affections, if they were permitted to act freely, as they\r\nspontaneously arise in the breast of mankind, are designed to bind all\r\nthe human race in one bond of brotherhood.\r\n\r\nOur own parents and near relatives first call these affections into\r\nactive exercise.  Their care and attention to our welfare, the interest\r\nthey take in preserving us in a state of safety and health, and in\r\nteaching us also the duties we owe both to our Creator and\r\nfellow-creatures, tend to give the first impetus to the germs of our\r\naffections; and it is by the exercise of these very affections that we\r\nderive a continual source of happiness, which becomes hereafter the\r\nchief means by which the refinement of the senses may be effected.\r\nThus it is, that when death, or other causes, deprive us of our\r\nimmediate parental guidance, the affections as naturally seek for new\r\nobjects, on which to exert their influence, as the operations of any\r\nother well recognised principles proceed in the works of nature.\r\n\r\nThe author and hero of the following narrative, was called upon to\r\nexperience the sudden deprivation of not only his parents, but of all\r\nhis dearest friends; and that at an age when the heart first expands to\r\nthe relations of our existence, and is most sensitive to the emotions\r\nof grief; when, unexpectedly and unprepared, it is cut off from all\r\nsympathy or communication with human kind.  At the age of thirteen he\r\nwas lost in an almost boundless Guiana forest, where he remained for\r\nseveral years, dependent solely upon his own resources, mental and\r\nphysical--that is, on the one hand, to bear the mind up against the\r\nshock it received in being thrown suddenly into solitude; and, on the\r\nother, to provide for his daily wants.  That man never was intended to\r\nlive in what is denominated \"a state of nature,\" is manifest by his\r\nlong infancy and the tardy development of his mental powers.  No animal\r\nis so long after its birth before it can support the body on its legs\r\nas man; in none is the period of complete adult stature so long\r\nprotracted.  When born into the world he is entirely defenceless, his\r\ngreat distinctions from other animals are reason and speech: these,\r\nhowever, are germs which are not developed of themselves, but are\r\nbrought to maturity by extraneous assistance, cultivation, and\r\neducation; hence we must infer that man was intended for social union,\r\nand that his imaginary state of nature, which some writers have spoken\r\nof, never has existed.\r\n\r\nMan, however, in his nature, is limited in no respect; being fitted for\r\nevery kind of life, every climate, and every variety of food.  The\r\nDeity has given him the whole earth for his abode, and the produce\r\nthereof for his nourishment.  With the advantages, however, of an early\r\nmoral and religious education, together with an excellent constitution,\r\nour juvenile exile from man was enabled, under the direction of a\r\nwatchful Providence, to preserve his life, protect his mind against\r\ndespondency, and procure a subsistence in the midst of dangers.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties he encountered, the manner in which he overcame them,\r\nand the scenes which were brought under his view in the extended field\r\nof observation into which he was thrown, it is the object of the\r\nfollowing narrative to lay before the reader.  To those whose knowledge\r\nextends not beyond the world of man to the boundless fields of nature,\r\nit may appear that such a life must have been one of monotonous\r\nlistlessness, from which few materials could be gathered to impart\r\nknowledge or interest to the general reader.\r\n\r\nOur hero, however, found employment for the mind in every moment of his\r\nwaking hours, and was furnished with objects for study in the forest,\r\nthat might engage the longest period of life allotted to man to\r\ncatalogue or enumerate.\r\n\r\nHappily for the exile, his mind was formed to seek for knowledge in the\r\nonly sources open to man for the full development of the intellectual\r\npowers; namely, observation and reflection.\r\n\r\nDenied the aid of books, in the far woods that \"steeped in their\r\nmoonbeams lie,\" he called upon his Maker, and the echo of the floor of\r\nthe forest recognised his presence.  Acquiring confidence from this\r\nassurance, and relying on Providence for protection, he converted the\r\nscenes around him into a school of study, and realized in the woods a\r\nlife of activity instead of one of solitude.  He soon discovered, when\r\nleft to draw deductions from his own experience in the scenes of\r\nNature, that there is nothing but what is beautiful, nothing unworthy\r\nof admiration.  \"The disregard,\" he says, \"which by many is paid to her\r\nproductions, reflects no honour on those who evince it, and little\r\ncredit on a system of education that does not at once lead its pupils\r\nto the grand fountain of all knowledge.  While the majority,\" he adds,\r\n\"of my youthful contemporaries were engaged in committing to memory a\r\nvocabulary of words, I was busily engaged in studying the things\r\nthemselves.\"  While others were spending their time in acquiring a\r\nknowledge of the customs and forms of artificial society, our exile had\r\nthe great book of nature widely spread open before him, Throughout that\r\nperiod of life which is usually devoted, by the majority of\r\nindividuals, to study the purposes of social life, he was conversing\r\nonly with the trees; or with the birds, and insects, and other tribes,\r\nof the animal kingdom, all the works of God, and to which his\r\nattachment was ardent and sincere.  Now that he is again in the society\r\nof his fellow-men, the recollections of his sylvan probation are as\r\nvividly depicted on his mind as at the moment when he first received\r\nthe impressions.  Trees which supplied him with food, or shelter from\r\nthe heat of the sun or the rains of the climate, are still dear to his\r\nrecollection, and he often reverts to them with feelings of gratitude\r\nand respect, from which he would not, if he could, estrange the\r\naffections of his heart.\r\n\r\nThere is no music so sweet to his ear as the breezes that animated the\r\nlofty cloud-aspiring monarchs of the forest, with which he claims a\r\npeculiar acquaintance, or the murmuring of the brook, where he was wont\r\nto slake his thirst; no concert to his sense of sound so grateful as\r\nthe wild notes of the birds that chanted, morning and evening, their\r\nMaker's praise, as he offered up his own prayers of gratitude for the\r\nprolongation of his existence, or the hummings of the myriads of\r\ninsects, that every hour, in his woodland rovings, arrested his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nIt was while listening to these voices of the Creator that his heart\r\nwas first touched with feelings of admiration and wonder at the\r\nmultifarious and exquisitely organized beings that everywhere, whether\r\nin tranquil meditation or in active search of his food, met his sight.\r\nHe saw nature everywhere teeming with life, and proclaiming in language\r\nintelligible to every one the presence of an All-directing Power.  It\r\nwas in the forest, too, in the midst of the wonders of the creation,\r\nthat the lost youth first aspired to lift up his thoughts to heaven,\r\nand mentally exclaim--\"These are thy works, oh God!\"  It was also in\r\nthe lonely wilderness he first cherished the hope, in the language of\r\nthe Indian, that the Great Spirit had provided for him a higher state\r\nof happiness; and then it was he offered up a prayer, that this hope\r\nmight, in his Maker's own time, be realized.  It was also in the\r\nwilderness, communing with his own thoughts, that he first received an\r\nassurance that he possessed a soul to be saved, and became imbued with\r\na firm conviction that the wise Creator, in his infinite beneficence,\r\ndesigned the happiness of his creatures, and that nothing can deprive\r\nthe human race of his blessings but a connexion with sin.\r\n\r\nWith an undivided mind, intent only on examining and admiring the works\r\nof creation, the youth, in his lonely wayfaring, everywhere found the\r\npresence of his Maker.  At the earliest moment of incipient vegetation,\r\nhe was busy watching the indications of bursting nature preparing to\r\nre-robe the trees; and in a prospective vista he beheld the joyous\r\nmovements of the various tribes of birds and insects providing for the\r\nwants of themselves and their progeny.  Not less busily was his mind\r\nengaged when these labours actually commenced, in noting the\r\nconstruction of their habitations, and in admiring the wonderful\r\ningenuity each displayed in providing for its own peculiar wants and\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nThus engaged in almost continual observation, he was enabled to trace\r\nthe manner in which numbers of the feathered and insect tribes worked\r\nout the purposes of their existence.  As the multifarious branches of\r\nthe trees of the forest expanded themselves into fulness of leaf, he\r\nsaw nations after nations of living things on the move to claim his\r\nattention, all pouring forth to seize on their share of the abundance\r\nof nature.  As each revolving season hastened the decay of or imparted\r\nnew vigour to the monarchs of the forest, the exile from man had an\r\nopportunity, abstracted as he was from the busy affairs of human life,\r\nto distinguish the various characteristics of the tribes of insects\r\nthat took possession of the trees, differing from those which,\r\napparently innoxiously, fed on their fulness of vegetable youthfulness,\r\nand the insects that came to prey only on the trunk or branches of\r\nthose that age or disease had brought to decay.  He saw the leaves of\r\nthe forest come into life, witnessed their gradual expansion into\r\nverdant beauty; he was there, likewise, at their decline and\r\nfall--recurring symbols of the succession of the races of mankind,--and\r\nwhen, the biting north winds denuded of their leaves many of these\r\nmighty monarchs of the forest, he collected them to form his woodland\r\nbed.  No season passed without adding to his store of information in\r\nreference to the works of nature, which knowledge, as we have already\r\nsaid, it is the design of this work to impart to others.  It is the\r\nnatural history of the forest, or so much of it as has been seen by one\r\nindividual during a period of six years' sojourn in its solitude.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated, the reader will not expect to find any\r\nclassified arrangement of subjects in this work; things are spoken of\r\nas they were seen, either in the stillness of the shade at one time, or\r\nin the raging of the storm at another.  Forest trees, in general, are\r\ndescribed; those which may afford food to man are more frequently\r\nmentioned.  Of quadrupeds, birds of the air, and insects, those that\r\nmost excited his attention are more especially noticed.  Those whose\r\nferocity or whose shyness rendered it hazardous or difficult to\r\napproach them, are less spoken of.  The details of the author's\r\nhistory, in reference to his probation in the wilds of nature, he has\r\nendeavoured to relate in a most familiar manner, and in the simplest\r\nlanguage; and when describing scenes and events, faithfully to impart\r\nthe impressions made on his own mind as they occurred.\r\n\r\nReasoning from the convictions arising from his experience,--that is,\r\nthe effects wrought upon his own mind--he thinks that the study of\r\nnatural objects, used as a means for the improvement of the religious\r\nand moral character of mankind, has been much overlooked by the\r\nphilanthropist, and neglected by those who are sincere in their desire\r\nto improve their own species.\r\n\r\nWhen the author was restored to society, nothing more excited his\r\nsurprise than the total absence of a system of education which should\r\nat once direct the mind of youth to the fountain of all knowledge; and,\r\nin consequence, to persons he met with who took any lively interest in\r\nthe study of natural objects, he remarked, \"Your system of education\r\nappears more designed to exercise the mere verbal memory, than to\r\nexcite observation or reflection;\" adding, \"that an acquaintance with\r\nthe works of the Deity, as they are seen remote from the haunts of men,\r\nnot only expands and elevates the thought, but spiritualises the soul.\"\r\nThe contemplation of nature's works, while it subdues the pride of man,\r\nharmonizes the feelings of social life, and in a peculiar manner\r\nprepares the mind for the reception of revealed truths.  It is only\r\nnecessary to add that, the education of the \"Emigrant's Son,\"\r\npreviously to his exclusion from the world of man, had not in any way\r\nbeen of a peculiarly religious tendency; nor had he evinced any\r\npredilection for discussing religious topics.  Yet, when he was brought\r\nto contemplate the works of the Deity on an extended scale, he\r\neverywhere found the indications of the presence of a superior and\r\nall-wise Creator in those scenes.  It is therefore natural that he\r\nshould feel a desire that others should seek and find Him at the same\r\npure fountain of knowledge.  \"The voice of my beloved; behold he cometh\r\nleaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills.\"  (Solomon, ii. 9.)\r\n\r\nTrue it is, that the student who once enters the portals of natural\r\nhistory, seldom thinks of returning.  Strolling from object to object,\r\nhis appetite is never satiated.  St. Pierre aptly remarked, that\r\n\"nature invites to the cultivation of herself.\"  Should the perusal of\r\nthe following page direct the mind of the youthful reader to the study\r\nof nature, the object of publishing this narrative will have been\r\nattained.\r\n\r\nG. H. W.\r\n\r\nHARRINGTON COTTAGE,\r\n  BROMPTON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMIGRANT'S LOST SON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF LEAVING ENGLAND AND ARRIVAL AT THE FOREST.\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"On the bosom, lone and still,\r\n  Of nature east, I early sought to stroll\r\n    Through wood and wild, o'er forest, rook, and hill,\r\n  Companionless; without a wish or goal,\r\n    Save to discover every shape and voice\r\n  Of living thing that there did fearlessly rejoice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs it is my object to lay before my readers only that portion of my\r\nlife which was passed in the wilds of nature, it will be unnecessary\r\nfor me to detain them with a lengthened account of the genealogy of my\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nMy father occupied a small farm in the west of England, situate near a\r\npeaceful village, the curate of which superintended the education of\r\nmyself and some fourteen or fifteen of the neighbouring youths.  I was\r\nbetween ten and eleven years of age, when a stranger arrived at our\r\nhouse, informing the family that, in consequence of the death of my\r\nfather's elder brother, he, together with two surviving brothers, had\r\njointly become the proprietors of a tract of land situate in the\r\nsouth-western part of Guiana.\r\n\r\nIt subsequently appeared that my deceased uncle had speculated in the\r\npurchase of the land in question, intending to have invited his three\r\nbrothers to join him in the cultivation of it.  Death frustrated these\r\nintentions, the land became the joint property of the survivors, and\r\nafter using every effort to dispose of it in this country, being\r\nunsuccessful in meeting with a purchaser, the three brothers came to\r\nthe resolution of going out, together with their families, and sharing\r\ntheir newly-acquired property.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First leaving home]\r\n\r\nWhen the order was finally given to prepare for the voyage, it operated\r\non my mind almost as a penal sentence; expatriation presented itself to\r\nmy imagination as the climax of all evils.  It now suddenly occurred to\r\nme that I had a thousand local attachments, all of which were to be\r\nbroken asunder; my imagination passing in review a painful parting with\r\nmy schoolfellows and other intimates; when all the early and recent\r\nscenes of my short career poured in on the memory, and seemed to bind\r\nme to the immediate locality of my existence and its environs.  I then\r\ndiscovered that I had a real attachment for my teacher, the good pastor\r\nof a small flock; indeed, every person known to me, I thought had, in\r\nsome way, been peculiarly kind, and a torrent of gratitude overflowed\r\nthe heart; while the idea of quitting the scenes of my childhood, and\r\nall I then knew of the world, presented itself as the annihilation of\r\nevery object from which I had hitherto derived pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe young heart is generally thought to bound with joyousness at the\r\nprospect of a change of scene, but it was otherwise with me: the world,\r\nin the map of my microcosm, excepting the circumscribed view I had\r\ntaken of it, was an entire desert, where there was no one to love or be\r\nloved.  In this state of mind the agitation of my feelings nearly\r\nchoked me, till I sought the favourite arm of a tree in the orchard,\r\nwhere, unobserved, I found relief in a flood of tears.  Still\r\noppressed, as the evening advanced I crept to bed without speaking to\r\nany one,--not even to my sister, whose buoyant joyfulness at the time\r\nexcited my surprise.  I spent the night in a state of half-dreamy\r\nstupor, being neither asleep nor awake; whilst the imagination was\r\nengaged in endeavouring to contrast the retrospection of the past with\r\nthe prospects of the future.  Every act of kindness which had been\r\nbestowed upon me, stood out in strong relief in my memory, as a vista\r\nof other days, and into which I had not previously been permitted to\r\nlook; whilst the little village-world was presented to my view as a\r\nbright speck in creation--an oasis in a desert, all around which was a\r\nmass of confusion and darkness.\r\n\r\nThe placid countenance of the curate, monarch of his locality, with all\r\nthe scholastic paraphernalia, were brought vividly under review; the\r\nform on which I was wont to sit, with every cut I had made on the\r\nwell-marked desk with my knife--an instrument with which boys early\r\nprove themselves tool-loving animals--were all objects of endearment to\r\nme.  My fancy then roamed into the little churchyard, where I took a\r\nview of each mouldering heap, with the tombstones at the head and foot,\r\nevery epitaph on which I had committed to memory.  I then stood under\r\nthe brave old Hercules, as we designated an oak tree where four of us\r\nhad met most days to proceed together to school.  Here I distinctly\r\nnoted--such is the power of memory when the feelings are excited--each\r\nabrupt rising of its rugged roots, and marked the boundary of its\r\nshadows at different hours of the day, as described by its broad,\r\nout-spreading limbs on the greensward.\r\n\r\nI wandered to the copse, entered by a well-defined gap at the angular\r\npoint; noted each spot where I had taken eggs or young ones from birds\r\nthat had been incautious enough to attract my attention; paused to take\r\na last look at the hazel from which I had gathered the largest cob-nut;\r\nlingering at every step, and sighing as I passed each object of\r\nremembrance.  The following morning, sleepless and weary, I arose with\r\nthe sun, and collected all my little stock of property--bows and\r\narrows, fishing-tackle, bats, balls, and other juvenile valuables;\r\nthese I labelled as presents to my intimates.  My heart then knew how\r\nhighly it was susceptible of friendship; it had yet to learn how\r\nreadily, after the lapse of a few years, such attachments are\r\nforgotten.  The desire in after life to meet with an old schoolfellow\r\nis seldom prompted by a higher motive than a curiosity to learn his\r\nsuccess in the world.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that my parents had associations and connexions from\r\nwhich they were about to separate, and deeper feelings of regret to\r\nstruggle with, than myself, when parting from attached friends.  It is\r\nfresh in my memory that our calls were very numerous, and that many\r\nreasons were adduced to dissuade my father from emigration.  The Sunday\r\npreviously to our departure, the curate, from the pulpit, mentioned the\r\nintention of the families to emigrate, and offered up a prayer for the\r\nrealization of their prospects of success.  I shall ever remember the\r\nday I left the kind preceptor of my youth and the companions of my\r\nboyish days.  My father had sent a chaise to fetch me and my valuable\r\nstock of personal property a day before our final departure.  I think I\r\nsee now the mild old curate shaking my hand and giving me his blessing\r\nand friendly advice, while around the gate of the old house were\r\nassembled my school companions, to take a last sight of me before I\r\ntook my leave of home and of them.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Voyage to Demerara]\r\n\r\nOur journey to the coast, and voyage to Demerara, a _ci-devant_ Dutch\r\nsettlement, was unattended by any circumstance of peculiar interest.  I\r\ntherefore take up the narrative from the period of our landing.  My\r\nfather was purely a business man, never permitting pleasure or\r\ncuriosity to divert him from his pursuits.  Immediately, therefore, on\r\nour arrival at Demerara, preparations were made for us to proceed on\r\ntowards our destination, regarding the situation and name of which I\r\nhad not up to that time taken any interest, I had, however, heard that\r\nwe had to travel some hundreds of miles over a country where there were\r\nno roads, as in England.  I also remember a long discussion between my\r\nfather and my two uncles, whether we should travel with a waggon or\r\npurchase horses and mules to carry our luggage and relieve the females\r\nwhen fatigued.  As our course was through an extensive wooded country,\r\nwhere carriages could not conveniently pass, the latter mode of\r\ntravelling was ultimately adopted.  Our party consisted of nine\r\npersons, namely, my father, mother, sister, and self; one uncle, with a\r\ngrown-up son (his father being a widower); the other uncle, his wife,\r\nand son (a youth three years older than myself).\r\n\r\nMy father provided himself with a horse and mule; the latter to carry\r\nour personal necessaries, and the former to alternately relieve my\r\nmother, and my sister, who was a healthy girl of sixteen years of age,\r\nwhen either was fatigued with walking.  One other horse was purchased\r\nfor the use of my aunt and the party in general.  We were provided with\r\ntwo painted cloths, to be used as a covering when we should halt for\r\nrest, and no better accommodation could be obtained.  I remember my\r\nfather making a pen-and-ink sketch of the route, marking down, with the\r\nassistance of a traveller, the stages we were daily to accomplish.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Crossing the savanna]\r\n\r\nThus prepared and equipped, as all of us were in excellent health and\r\nspirits, we commenced our journey over the plantations of the settlers,\r\nproceeding onwards till we reached the extended savannas--open plains.\r\nHere the scene was altogether so new and striking, that it was with\r\ndifficulty I could be prevented from running after every living thing\r\nthat came under my view.  At one moment I was lost in wonder at the\r\nmultitudes of creeping creatures which, at every step, crossed my path,\r\nwhile the birds of the air in numbers, variety, and plumage, fixed me\r\nwith astonishment.  My excitement was so great that I actually screamed\r\nwith delight; at another moment I ran from object to object with such\r\neagerness, that, my mother became alarmed for my intellect, affirming\r\nthat no one in their senses could sustain so much unnatural excitement.\r\n\r\nOn the third day of our journey I began to be seriously fatigued, and\r\nmy father placed me across the back of our mule.  This, however, was a\r\nmeasure against which the animal at once entered his protest, by\r\nrefusing to move forward the moment I threw my legs across him; his\r\nconduct seemed to imply that at starting a contract had been made with\r\nhim to carry the baggage, and he would not consent to its infringement;\r\nand it would appear that the mere attempt to overburden him soured his\r\ntemper for the whole journey; for a more obstinate or perverse mule was\r\nnever crossed by man or boy.  At length we entered into a compromise,\r\nby removing a portion of his baggage to one of our horses; and he then\r\nallowed me to ride in peace, as he proceeded sulkily along.  He was,\r\nhowever, faithful to his second bargain, never evincing any more\r\ndiscontent.  This third day of our journey was the longest we had yet\r\nhad, and we were all of us anxiously looking for some habitation\r\ntowards its close, where we might rest for the night.  The sun soon\r\npromised to hide his golden beams behind the hills which formed the\r\nhorizon, and we all showed signs of fatigue.  We were much delighted\r\nwhen my father informed us that we were approaching the house of a\r\nsettler, where he hoped to obtain shelter for the night.  We proceeded\r\nup a steep declivity to the house in question, forming rather a\r\npicturesque party.  My sister was first, mounted on a heavy dappled\r\ngrey horse, with my father and mother by her side.  I followed on my\r\nmule; while the remainder of the party were some fifty yards in the\r\nrear.  As we halted before the house, my father informed us that, in\r\nall probability, this would be the last time we should find\r\naccommodation, even in the outhouse of a settler; and that in future we\r\nshould have to resort to our painted cloths for shelter during the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nWe all retired to rest, therefore, with a determination to lay in a\r\ngood stock of sleep.  Notwithstanding this determination, and the\r\nfatigue I had endured in the excessive heat of the day, the novelty of\r\nmy new existence resisted every effort to close my eyes for rest; and I\r\narose in the morning but very little refreshed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The blessing of rain]\r\n\r\nDuring the first five days of our journey the intense heat of the sun,\r\nto which we were unseasoned, annoyed us all exceedingly; while the\r\nscorching earth so much blistered my feet that, on the sixth morning, I\r\nlingered behind, and divested myself of both stockings and shoes,\r\nhanging them upon the mule's baggage.  In the school of experience\r\nnature is head master.  The relief was almost instantaneous; and,\r\nduring that day, I surprised my fellow-travellers with my pedestrian\r\nperformances, which induced them all to follow my example.  Early the\r\nsame afternoon, the rain began to fall in torrents, or rather in\r\nsheets, previously to which, during our journey over the plains, the\r\nextreme dryness of the weather had occasioned one of those vegetable\r\nconflagrations so common in hot countries.  Hitherto the scene had been\r\narid, the land being hard to the feet, and painfully dry to the eye.\r\nThe following morning, we had an opportunity of observing with what\r\nsurprising rapidity nature, in these climates, clothes the earth.  Our\r\ncourse was now on a wide-expanded green carpet, every where soft and\r\ncooling to the feet, and deliciously refreshing to the sight.  Birds of\r\nevery hue, gems of the air, glittered in our pathway; a vast number of\r\nthe cormorant species were busy in gobbling up frogs, toads, and\r\nsnakes; the eagle and the vulture, too, were soaring over our heads,\r\nlooking out for the prey these regions afford them in such abundance.\r\nEvery step we took frightened up flocks of the smaller feathered tribe,\r\nand brought to view myriads of other living things, such as slugs,\r\nsnails, and insects of every variety.\r\n\r\nOn the tenth day of our journey, we approached a country covered, as\r\nfar as the eye could reach, with dense foliage, variegated with every\r\nknown or imaginable hue, the groundwork of which was one wide-spreading\r\nmass of every shade of green.  There were browns of all tints, yellow,\r\norange, purple, and brilliant scarlets, so intermingled as to present\r\none uninterrupted view of nature in glorious beauty, spreading over an\r\nundulating mass of waving forest-green, while, in appearance, reaching\r\nfrom the high heavens to the earth, into which the lower sweeps seemed\r\nto dip, conveying the idea of eternal spring, summer, and autumn,\r\nharmoniously blended into one.  As we skirted the forest, the charming\r\nvariety of the blossoms, and their shades of colour, presented a still\r\nmore enlivened appearance--the tops of the trees being covered with\r\nbloom, some standing erect towards the light of the sun, others bending\r\ndown, with a profusion of fruit and seed.\r\n\r\nYet, even here, in this enchanting scene, was man admonished, and\r\nreminded of mortality: as we passed the margin of the wood, here and\r\nthere was seen some former giant of the forest, whose head had been\r\nbared by time or the thunder blast, painfully, in the midst of nature's\r\nprodigal luxuriance, intimating that all things have their period of\r\nbirth, maturity, and decay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Meeting with natives]\r\n\r\nPenetrated with surprise and admiration at the scene, it was some time\r\nbefore we discovered that we were approaching a party of natives, who,\r\nit was evident, had been watching our movements.  When they first\r\nattracted our notice, the sound of what we took for a village bell fell\r\nupon the ear; whereupon my father flattered himself that we were\r\napproaching a civilized settlement; while both my uncles were of\r\nopinion that a signal of alarm was given at our approach, and, in\r\nconsequence, prepared for defence.  The bell, however, sounded only at\r\nintervals of four or five minutes; and as there was no increase of\r\nnumbers in consequence, we at once went forth to meet the natives.\r\nThey consisted of a party of six, besides an old negro, who seemed to\r\nbe the patriarch of his race.  To our surprise and delight, he spoke\r\nEnglish remarkably well, as did also a young man who appeared to be his\r\nson.  Probably, they were runaway slaves.  They proved, however, to be\r\nfriendly disposed; and when we spoke of the bell, and the negro had\r\nexplained the nature of our enquiry, they all broke out into a most\r\nimmoderate fit of laughter.  The negro, almost convulsed, said, \"White\r\nbird, ding dong--ding, dong! a great way off; for white man here, white\r\nbird, ding, dong--ding, dong!\"  The bird that sends forth this peculiar\r\nsound is named the campanero, and is snow white; it may be heard at\r\nthree miles' distance; and during my sojourn subsequently in the wilds\r\nof nature, it was the only sound that daily recalled to my recollection\r\nthe tones of my native village church bell.\r\n\r\nAs we were all attention to the negro, who was very lively and\r\ngarrulous, a flock of birds passed over our heads, emitting sounds that\r\nmight be mistaken for those of a trumpet; when the old man pointed up,\r\nand laughingly said--\"Red-coats, red-coats!\" meaning to ask,\r\nironically, if we took the birds for soldiers?  These birds are\r\nproperly called Waracaba, and are frequently rendered domestic, when\r\nthey exhibit the attachment of a dog to their master, following him in\r\nthe same spirit of fidelity; their spirit, also, appears to exceed that\r\nof the game cock--although unarmed with spurs for defence, they will\r\nfly at a dog; and, in a domestic state, seldom fail to browbeat and\r\nlord it over the dunghill cocks living in the same yard.\r\n\r\nWhile my father was consulting with the negro regarding our bivouac for\r\nthe night, the latter suddenly seized his foot, exclaiming, \"_Chegoe_\r\nin toe,\" then forcing him to the ground, and taking from his pocket a\r\nknife, proceeded to extract one of those formidable insects, which had\r\nbecome embedded in the skin of the foot.  This insect, had it been\r\nallowed to remain, would have, no doubt, produced inflammation, from\r\nits bite, and, in all probability, caused my father lameness for some\r\nweeks.  The negroes treated us with the greatest possible kindness and\r\nrespect; and the old man, who appeared the orator of his party,\r\ninsisted upon our sharing their hospitality, by partaking of their\r\nevening meal, which we readily accepted, producing, at the same time,\r\nour own provisions; and such an interchange of delicacies took place,\r\nthat I am sure it would puzzle me now to recollect or enumerate them.\r\nI know it was the cause of some considerable share of merriment among\r\nus all.  Their food, if I remember rightly, appeared to me to consist\r\nmore of vegetables and fruit than ours, and was of a simpler nature.  I\r\nfancy if some of our worthy civic authorities had been present as\r\npartakers of this repast, they would have been more surprised at the\r\nviands than delighted.\r\n\r\nBut man is of a ductile nature--a creature of habit, and may almost\r\nhabituate himself to anything.  In civilized cities, where thousands\r\nare taxing their energies in the pursuit of wealth and position in\r\nsociety, an artificial state of existence is the consequence; and the\r\nprimitive fare of our forefathers is superseded by something of a more\r\nstimulating nature.  I have seen, in my experience in forest life, how\r\nlittle man can subsist upon, and how healthy and strong he may continue\r\nin a simple state of existence.  Civilization brings with it a host of\r\nimaginary and fictitious wants.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The repast with the negroes]\r\n\r\nWe accepted the offer of our newly-made friends to share with them\r\ntheir small huts for the night, and they being plentifully provided\r\nwith various skins of animals, a more agreeable resting-place could\r\nhardly be desired.  The old negro, without being obtrusively\r\ninquisitive, was anxious to know our object in crossing the country;\r\nand my father informed him of our route, and produced the rough chart\r\nhe had made upon our first starting upon the expedition.  A long\r\nconsultation was the result, and a doubtful shake of the head was given\r\nby the old man as to the possibility of our accomplishing the task; at\r\nthe same time he gave an incredulous look at my mother and sister, who,\r\nhe seemed to consider, would hardly be able to endure the journey and\r\nthe hardships attending it.  To say the truth, my mother looked but\r\nvery weak, and I remember being struck myself with her appearance.  My\r\nsister was of such a buoyant temperament, that her joyous spirit would\r\ncarry her through almost any temporary difficulties; but still we were\r\nall considerably jaded.  And I remember I thought the rude habitation\r\nof our entertainers a most delightful place of refuge, compared to\r\nbeing obliged to bivouac in the woods; and, indeed, I dreaded leaving\r\nthe following morning.  I believe we were all of us impressed with the\r\nsame idea.  When we at first met with them, I was overcome with\r\nsurprise, and was afraid that some calamity was about to befal us.  By\r\ndegrees, however, the feeling wore off, and by that strong and\r\nundefined species of discernment which most possess in discovering\r\nthose kindly disposed towards us, I became on most familiar terms with\r\nour friends.  The young man, whose name was Rangal, I discovered, was\r\nthe only son of the elder negro.  He was very solicitous in his\r\nattentions to me, and his peculiar manners considerably amused me\r\nduring our evening's sojourn.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: More negroes]\r\n\r\nUpon our retiring to rest, the two negroes, father and son, took up\r\ntheir station in the apartment we had at first entered; this they did\r\nto keep watch that no one should harm us; not that there was any\r\nabsolute necessity for their so doing, but it was an attention meant to\r\nimpress us with confidence as to our safety.  Early the following\r\nmorning, after a refreshing and undisturbed sleep, I accompanied Rangal\r\nto take a survey of the surrounding country, calling at a neighbouring\r\nhabitation where the remaining portion of the negroes had located.\r\nThey conversed with my guide a great deal, two or three speaking at the\r\nsame time; but it was in a dialect entirely new to me, and beyond my\r\ncomprehension.  They evidently, by their gestures, referred to us; but\r\nin what way, I was at a loss to understand.  There were also a female\r\nand three children, the latter varying from seven to eleven years old.\r\nThey looked at me in perfect amazement, and the three children retired,\r\nwhispering, to a corner at the darkest part of the room; but I could\r\nsee by the whites of their eyes in the gloom, that their gaze was\r\nrivetted upon me, in which a feeling of curiosity was mingled with\r\ndread.  For myself, I was only struck with their comical appearance,\r\nand fairly laughed outright, in which I was joined by the negroes, one\r\nof whom, I supposed their father, brought them forward and introduced\r\nthem in due form.\r\n\r\nUpon returning to our habitation of the previous night, we found our\r\nparty taking their morning's repast; and I learned that the old negro\r\nhad insisted upon accompanying us, with his son Rangal, on our journey\r\nduring the day.  He had also arranged where we should halt for the\r\nfollowing night  which was at the habitation of a friend of his,\r\nsituate many miles on our road.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The forest]\r\n\r\nAll being got in readiness, we again commenced our pilgrimage.  There\r\nhad been a heavy fall of rain in the night, and it was comparatively\r\ncool and refreshing to what it had been, but still the heat was intense\r\nto us.  We, however, proceeded on our journey with tolerable spirits.\r\nMy father and uncle shot several birds in the early part of the day,\r\nwhich afforded us an excellent repast.  We shortly arrived at a thick\r\nand apparently impenetrable forest.  Through this we had to travel\r\nbefore reaching our destination for the night.  Once having fairly\r\nentered its precincts, there appeared to my mind an impossibility of\r\never again emancipating ourselves from it.  The sun, which had been so\r\nscorching to our aching sight, was now no longer visible, save here and\r\nthere, where a few rays would find a passage through the otherwise\r\nimpenetrably dense foliage, to remind us of the world beyond our sight.\r\nThe luxuriance of the foliage, the variety of tropical plants which in\r\nthe fecundity of nature spring up in a few hours--so rapid is their\r\ngrowth in these climates,--the busy hum of myriads of insects, the\r\nreptiles, and occasionally the howling of the fiercer animals of prey,\r\ncan hardly be appreciated by description.  Ever and anon we paused, as\r\na rustling of the foliage would give notice of the passage of some\r\nfierce animal, who was, as he stole along, unconscious of the presence\r\nof man in his domains.  We proceeded most watchfully on our way, my\r\nfather and uncle with guns across their shoulders, ready for immediate\r\nservice, if required; so, what with our number, and the caution used,\r\nwe felt ourselves tolerably secure; the more so, as it is a remarkable\r\nfact that no species of animal, however fierce, is ever very willing to\r\nattack man in open combat, without provocation.\r\n\r\nWaterton, the celebrated naturalist, who has travelled through the\r\nwoods in search of animals for scientific purposes, says, speaking on\r\nthis subject, \"Time and experience has convinced me that there is not\r\nmuch danger in roving amongst snakes and wild beasts, provided you have\r\nself-command.  You must never approach them abruptly; if so, you are\r\nsure to pay for your rashness, because the idea of self-defence is\r\npredominant in every animal; and thus the snake, to defend himself from\r\nwhat he considers an attack upon him, makes the intruder feel the\r\ndeadly effect of his poisonous fangs.  The jaguar flies at you, and\r\nknocks you senseless with a stroke of his paw; whereas, if you had not\r\ncome upon him too suddenly, it is ten to one but that he had retired,\r\nin lieu of disputing the path with you.\"  Secure, however, as we might\r\nfeel ourselves, it was a matter of surprise to us how the two negroes\r\nwould fare upon their return, without our party.  They would, however,\r\nin spite of every persuasion to the contrary, persist in accompanying\r\nus, and we were fain to let them have their own way.  Presently an\r\nincident occurred which made us see the necessity of caution.  As I was\r\nwalking by the side of my uncle Henry, I discerned, glaring from a\r\nneighbouring clump of foliage, two fierce-looking eyes.  I impulsively\r\ncaught my uncle by the arm, and pointed in breathless terror to the\r\nspot.  He paused, and raising his gun, would have fired, had not my\r\nfather precipitately intervened, and motioned him to be passive.  \"Do\r\nnot venture to fire,\" he whispered, \"till there is a greater\r\nnecessity.\"  At the same time he raised his gun, and both kept guard\r\ntill the other members of our party passed the point where danger was\r\nto be feared.  The animal did not move, but appeared ready to spring\r\nforth; which had it done, the pieces must then have been discharged.\r\nWhen we had got some little distance from the object of our dread, my\r\nfather and uncle gradually retreated, with their faces and guns\r\ndirected towards the animal, until they had got sufficiently out of\r\ndanger; and we had the satisfaction of observing the animal bound off\r\nin another direction.  It appeared to be a tolerably large-sized puma,\r\nas well as we could discern.  This little incident made us doubly\r\ncautious, and all were loud in praising the presence of mind evinced by\r\nmy father; for had my uncle fired so incautiously, it is very\r\nimprobable that he would have wounded the animal mortally, but it might\r\nhave incited him to a desperate attack upon us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The negro's daughter]\r\n\r\nAfter one or two false alarms, we arrived again in the open country.\r\nThe darkness of the forest had led us to believe that the day was on\r\nthe decline; but on emerging into the plain we were greeted again with\r\nthe rays of the sun.  We had still, however, some distance to journey\r\nbefore we arrived at our proposed destination, and my mother, who\r\nappeared wearied, was again seated on the back of one of the mules.\r\nBut even this mode of conveyance was fatiguing to one unaccustomed to\r\nsuch long journeys, in a country so different to our own.  The negroes\r\nwere the most fresh of the party; indeed, heat, and long hours of\r\nfatigue or anxiety, seemed to have no effect upon them, for they\r\nretained under these trials their good temper and loquacity.  The elder\r\nof the two seemed, as indeed he always had been, to be of a reflective\r\ntemperament; and as he was walking by the side of my father, somewhat\r\nahead of the rest, he turned round, and gazing at my sister, said,\r\n\"Make me think of de ole day--de ole day.\"  \"How so?\" said my father.\r\n\"Had a little girl once myself.  Long ago, now! long ago!\"  And he\r\nagain lapsed into silence, ruminating, in rather an abstracted\r\nmelancholy mood, for some minutes.  \"You lost her, then, did you?\" said\r\nmy father.  The old man shook his head sorrowfully, and placing his\r\nhand upon my father's shoulder, confidentially, exclaimed, \"De white\r\nman!\"  He then promised to tell us the history of the affair before\r\nleaving.  Arriving shortly at the point he had originally proposed when\r\nwe commenced our journey in the morning, we discerned two or three\r\nhabitations, even more rude than those we had left, and our guides\r\nexpressed much surprise and chagrin at finding them uninhabited.  We,\r\nhowever, determined upon taking possession of them for the night, and\r\nat once proceeded to make the necessary preparations for our stay.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The story of the negro]\r\n\r\nAgreeably to his promise, the old negro took an opportunity of relating\r\nhis history.  Our first surmise proved to be correct; he was indeed a\r\nrunaway slave.  Some years previously he and his family were sold to a\r\nnew owner, who proved to be a cruel and unfeeling taskmaster, the very\r\nopposite in character to the former owner, who was a kind-hearted, mild\r\ndisposed man.  His wife was so affected by the change and hard usage,\r\nthat she sunk into a desponding state, and eventually died, leaving him\r\nwith a son and daughter.  The cruel treatment evinced by their overseer\r\ntowards the latter, a little girl then of ten years old, was a constant\r\nsource of trouble and misery to the father, and eventually led to an\r\nopen revolt.  One day, when the brutality of this man was beyond all\r\nendurance, the father of the girl, in a fit of rage and disgust, struck\r\nhis superior to the earth.  Conscious of what he had done, and the\r\nfearful penalty attached to it, he fled frantically from the spot,\r\nwhither he knew not.  His feelings had been wound up to such a state of\r\nexcitement, that he was scarcely conscious of what he was about; but he\r\nhad soon left the scene of his suffering many miles distant.  His son,\r\nit appeared, who was at a remote part of the plantation, hearing of the\r\naffair, fled after his father, and they eventually, after enduring\r\nnumberless hardships, both succeeded in escaping; and notwithstanding\r\nthe large rewards offered for their capture, they were never betrayed.\r\nHis daughter he had learned nothing of for many years.  He had\r\nendeavoured to rescue her soon after his escape from the hands of her\r\ntormentor, but did not succeed.  Afterwards he learnt that she had left\r\nthe plantation, and had been passed into the hands of a new master at\r\nanother remote part of the country.  She was dangerously ill at that\r\ntime, and was not expected to recover.  The poor old negro grew very\r\nmournful as he concluded his narrative.  He had not heard of his\r\ndaughter for so long a period that he seemed to think it improbable he\r\nshould ever behold her again.  His story, I remember, called forth a\r\nlong discussion upon the horrors of slavery, the truth of which is now\r\nhappily made sufficiently manifest, and so universally acknowledged,\r\nthat it hardly needs repetition here.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning we parted with our two negro guides of the\r\nprevious day, but it was with the greatest unwillingness that they\r\ncould be persuaded to return to their home; eventually, however, we\r\ntook leave of them after presenting them two or three remembrances for\r\ntheir kindness.  We now journeyed on much the same as before, without\r\nany incident occurring worthy of notice, when, on the following day, we\r\nmet with two English gentlemen, both naturalists, on their way to the\r\nforest, to collect specimens for the advancement of scientific\r\nknowledge.  Their party comprised six, namely, themselves, two English\r\nattendants, and two negroes, whom they had purchased, with a promise of\r\nemancipation if they conducted themselves to their masters'\r\nsatisfaction.  These gentlemen were much delighted to meet with us, and\r\nagreed to journey our road, for the sake of company.  I was much\r\npleased with their society.  I was soon made sensible of the advantages\r\nof a system in studying the works of nature.  My senses had before been\r\nquite captivated and gratified with the general aspect of the scenes\r\nthrough which we had passed; but now I was taught to examine objects\r\nmore closely and in detail; to compare, arrange, and, above all, to\r\nstudy the uses and purposes of vegetable and animal constituents, with\r\ntheir mechanical construction, tracing, in some measure, the designs of\r\nthe Creator in all his works.  I was now awakened to an intellectual\r\ngratification exceeding that of the mere senses.  I learned how to\r\ncollect and store up knowledge in the memory, which elevated my notions\r\nof the human species and considerably augmented my self-respect.  The\r\nmore I found opportunities to bring the intellect into play, the more\r\napparent became the advantages which the civilized and cultivated man\r\npossessed over the mere savage or uninformed; and, in consequence, my\r\ndelight in receiving instruction was unbounded.\r\n\r\nUnlike myself, however, the gentlemen whom we accompanied did not\r\nappear to me to enjoy or appreciate my natural enthusiasm for varied\r\nscenery.  They carried on their researches with surprising ardour; and\r\nwhen in pursuit of an abstract or particular object, their attention\r\nwas wholly absorbed; nor were they in any way sparing of the lives of\r\nanimals, birds, or insects, when selecting their specimens from the\r\nabundance before them.  Their recklessness, too, in destroying what\r\nthey considered obnoxious animals, somewhat surprised me, so much so as\r\nto induce me to enquire what caused them to have antipathies, like unto\r\nchildren and some females, especially against spiders, beetles, &c.\r\nThe only answer I received was, \"We destroy only such things as are of\r\nno use to us, and those which come in our way when in search of our\r\nobject.\"  They soon, however, explained to me that the reason of their\r\nshooting such a number of birds was that they were in want of all the\r\nvarieties, and could not always distinguish, until they had them in\r\nhand, whether they had such a one amongst their collection.\r\n\r\nTo watch the young of animals, whether those species born with sight or\r\nclosed eyes, and note their progress towards perfection, and the\r\ncelerity with which some of them, birds especially, will remove\r\nthemselves, even while unfledged, from danger to security, is to see\r\nGod watching over all his creatures.  To be near when the cry of danger\r\nis started in the wood, and hear the whole flock, though composed of\r\ndifferent kinds of birds, each in their own peculiar note, cry \"Hush!\"\r\nto their young ones before they leave the nest,--to ascertain the\r\ncause, and then to have the satisfaction of removing that cause of\r\ndanger,--is to be an agent of the Deity in the work of benevolence.\r\n\r\n\"All are agents,\" said one of the gentlemen, \"in carrying out the\r\nbenevolent purposes of the Deity.  Direct your mind towards the various\r\nprovisions which nature has devised for the dispersion, of the seeds of\r\nplants, and introducing them, into proper situations for germination.\r\nEvery class of beings,\" he continued, \"is useful as a means to promote\r\nthe spread of seeds: man, beasts, birds, reptiles, and probably even\r\nfish, by consuming, cause the propagation of the _algae_ in the depths\r\nof the ocean; and the multiplied contrivances of hooks, awns, wings,\r\n&c., with the elastic and hygrometric power with which seeds are\r\nfurnished, manifest what infinite provision has been made for the\r\ndispersion of seeds, and successive productions of nature.\"\r\n\r\nIt was thus that they would tutor me, and relieve the tedium of the\r\nday, by instilling into my youthful mind the first rudiments of a\r\nknowledge respecting the works of the Deity, and the uses to which they\r\nwere applied; and I became aware of the wonders an all-bounteous\r\nProvidence has in store for an enquiring mind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rattlesnake]\r\n\r\nBut I now approach a period which proved an epoch in my existence.  It\r\nwas towards the evening of a very long and fatiguing day's journey,\r\nperhaps the most wearisome we had yet had, that we halted to refresh\r\nourselves, and consult where we should bivouac for the night.  We were\r\nall jaded, and scarcely knew how to proceed any further.  My sister was\r\nreclining on a bank, and had, unobserved by us, fallen fast asleep,\r\nfairly overcome with the fatigues of the day.  Her head was resting on\r\na small package of tightly compressed woollen cloths.  We had not\r\nnoticed her for some minutes, when one of the gentlemen who accompanied\r\nus was the first to observe her dangerous situation.  It was fortunate\r\nhe did so.  Taking my father by the arm, and leading him quietly away\r\nfrom the party, he directed his attention to my sister.  My father\r\nstood almost petrified with fear and horror, on observing a large\r\nrattlesnake moving from side to side on my sister's chest.  Upon the\r\nimpulse of the moment, he was incautiously about to rush to her rescue;\r\nbut was detained by his companion.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think it means any mischief,\" he whispered.  \"Make no noise,\r\nand I fancy it will merely cross your child's body, and go away.\"\r\n\r\nIn this, however, he was mistaken, for on reaching my sister's left\r\nshoulder the serpent deliberately coiled itself up; and although it\r\nmade no immediate attack, it did not appear at all likely to leave the\r\nside of the sleeper.\r\n\r\n\"Leave it to me,\" said my father's companion, \"to rescue the poor girl\r\nfrom her terrible position.  I know best the habits of these creatures,\r\nand how to treat them.  Make no noise, on your life, or your child may\r\nbe lost; but follow me.\"\r\n\r\nMy father obeyed; and our friend then determined that two of us should\r\nadvance in front, to divert the attention of the snake, while he should\r\nnoiselessly steal behind my sister, and, with a long stick, remove the\r\nreptile from her body.  The snake, on observing the approach of the two\r\nintruders in front of him, instantly raised its head, and darted out\r\nits forked tongue, at the same time shaking its rattles,--all\r\nindications of anger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Anxiety]\r\n\r\nEvery one of our party was in a state of fearful suspense and agitation\r\nfor the fate of my poor sister; who lay like a beautiful statue,\r\nsleeping the calm sleep of innocence, unconscious of her danger.  Our\r\nfriend advanced stealthily behind, with a stick of seven feet long he\r\nhad procured for the purpose.  In an instant, almost before we had time\r\nto observe it, he succeeded in cautiously inserting one end of the\r\nstick under one of the reptile's coils, and flung the creature some\r\nyards from my sister's body.  A wild scream of joy was the first\r\nindication my sister received of her danger and providential escape.\r\nIn the meantime, her preserver pursued the snake, and killed it.  It\r\nwas three feet seven inches long, and eleven years old; the age, our\r\nfriend said, was always to be ascertained by the number of rattles.  He\r\nalso informed us that there is no danger attending the destruction of\r\nthe rattlesnake, provided a person has a long pliant stick, and does\r\nnot approach nearer than the reptile's length; for they cannot spring\r\nbeyond it, and seldom act but upon the defensive.  We discovered, on\r\nsearching about, a nest of these snakes near to where my sister had\r\nbeen lying; and, after this incident, were a little more cautious in\r\ntaking our way along.  We could not shake off the alarm that it had\r\noccasioned; and it was with anxious thoughts and heavy hearts that we\r\nagain proceeded to seek repose from the day's troubles and fatigue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nI AM LOST IN THE FOREST--MY SITUATION AND FEELINGS DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Existence may be borne, and the deep root\r\n  Of life and sufferance make its firm abode\r\n  In bare and desolate bosoms: mute\r\n  The camel labours with the heaviest load,\r\n  And the wolf dies in silence.  Not bestow'd\r\n  In vain should such examples be; if they--\r\n  Things of ignoble or of savage mood--\r\n  Endure and shrink not, we of nobler clay\r\n  May temper it to bear; it is but for a day.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn arranging our watch for the night every precaution was taken to\r\nguard against intrusion; then most of the party composed themselves for\r\nsleep; indeed, the previous day had been one of peculiar fatigue and\r\ndisappointment--opiates much less injurious than those issued from a\r\ndruggist's shop.  I alone, and for the first time, became restless\r\nafter the approach of night--usually having fallen asleep as soon as I\r\nhad eaten my supper,--and became insensible to the busy hum of night,\r\nwhich in tropical countries is very noisy.  I lay down with the\r\nadventure of the snake on my mind, my reflections on which kept me\r\nawake till the nocturnal insects of the wood were all in full chorus,\r\nand the reptiles began to move.  Up to this hour I had no idea--so\r\nsoundly had I hitherto slept--that the night was as rife with sounds\r\nand animated nature as the day; differing not in their variety but only\r\nin their peculiar kinds.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Fireflies]\r\n\r\nAs I have in another place, under the head of a natural day in the\r\nforest, spoken of this hour, it will be unnecessary for me to describe\r\nit in this place; suffice it to say, that my ear being once engaged in\r\nattending to the succession of sounds which addressed it, sleep, for\r\nthe night, became hopeless.  About midnight I suddenly sprang to nay\r\nfeet with the surprise of being surrounded, as I thought, with flakes\r\nof fire, or rather with similar lights to those emitted by a jet of gas\r\nin the centre of glass drops.  Finding myself uninjured in the midst of\r\nmyriads of these dancing lights, I moved forward, as they moved, to\r\nexamine the phenomenon.  They were fireflies, whose light would have\r\nenabled me to see the hour by a watch.  They suddenly, however, left me\r\nin darkness, and that as rapidly as if they had really been gas-lights\r\nextinguished by the turning of the stop-cock.\r\n\r\nPausing for some minutes, and censuring my own conduct for having moved\r\nfrom the spot of our bivouac, my attention was again attracted by\r\nsounds of something in pain, close to my feet; it was evidently a bird,\r\nand I stooped with a view of taking it up, when the note proceeded from\r\nmy right, and then from the left, \"Crek-crek-crek!\"  Whether I was\r\nambitious to capture the bird, or whether I was moved by feelings of\r\ncompassion I know not, I acted on the impulse, and continued to turn\r\nfrom side to side till I had advanced some distance in the underwood in\r\na zig-zag direction.  At length, being vexed at my disappointment, I\r\nlost my temper, and rushed forward again with renewed determination to\r\ntake the wounded bird, which was always at my feet but never in my hand.\r\n\r\nHe who does not command his temper can scarcely fail to do wrong; and\r\nnever was indiscretion perhaps more severely punished than in my case.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Bewildered in the wood]\r\n\r\nI had committed an unpardonable act of imprudence in suffering my\r\ncuriosity regarding the light emitted by the firefly to lead me one\r\nyard from the bivouac; but afterwards to lose my presence of mind in\r\nsuch a situation and at such an hour, in the mere attempt to possess a\r\nwounded bird, was an act of puerility inexcusable in a boy many years\r\nmy junior.  Need I inform the reader that I was the dupe of a watchful\r\nparent, or perhaps there were two of them, who, with a view of\r\nprotecting their young ones, beguiled me from the spot where they were\r\nbeing reared.  The bird was a species of quail, which, like the plover\r\nin England, will pretend to be lame, to draw stragglers from its\r\nhiding-place.  When the cry of the quail ceased, without doubt I had\r\nbeen led a sufficient distance to place her progeny out of danger; I\r\nwas now enshrouded in all but utter darkness, and then bean to shout\r\nout to my uncle John, who was on watch, as loudly and as frequently as\r\nthe power of my lungs enabled me; but there was no response.  The\r\naphorism says, \"Do not halloo till you are out of the wood;\" and truly\r\nI might have spared my lungs, for calling was of no avail.  Errors and\r\nblunders generally run in sequences; had I remained on the spot when I\r\nfound myself first lost, the probability is that I should, when the\r\nmorning dawned, have been near enough to my friends to have been\r\ndiscovered.  But no! having been guilty of one act of folly, I must\r\nrepair it by committing a second.  My impatience impelled me to make an\r\neffort to retrace my steps; while a moment's reflection might have\r\nshown me, that as there was but one road back, so there were many which\r\nmight lead me farther into trouble.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this night was spent in exhausting my strength in vain\r\nand useless efforts to retrace my steps; and ere the sun rose, I was so\r\nfatigued and hoarse as to abandon every hope of making myself heard.\r\nExhausted nature alone brought conviction of the fruitlessness of such\r\nefforts.  I sat down on a blasted tree, and there relieved my harassed\r\nand affrighted spirits by a flood of tears, the shedding of which did\r\nindeed bring alleviation; for previously I felt as if my heart was\r\nbursting.  A heavy load of grief, however, still pressed with a leaden\r\nweight on my mind; but as the heart lightened, the reflective powers\r\nbegan to operate, and the full sense of my desolation was presented to\r\nmy view.  I was horror-stricken and paralysed; but as these paroxysms\r\npassed away, I gradually brought my mind to contemplate calmly my\r\nisolated situation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First sensation of solitude]\r\n\r\nI first reflected on the inestimable value of parental affection, the\r\nblessings conferred on us by friends, the pleasures of social life, and\r\nthe advantages mankind derive by forming communities.  At that moment\r\nthere was no sacrifice I would not have made to have been restored to\r\nmy family, and become again entitled to all these advantages.  Out of\r\nthis comparative state of calmness, I was roused by murmuring sounds\r\nwhich my excited imagination converted into human voices.  Oh, how my\r\nheart bounded, and with what intensity did the ear strain itself to\r\ncatch assurance that there was truth in its first impression.  But the\r\norgan had prejudged, and was not readily open to conviction.  I\r\ntherefore proceeded, with what haste my weary limbs would permit, to\r\nexercise the sense of sight.  Alas! it was but the murmuring of waters,\r\na gentle confluence of which was precipitated over an elevated rock of\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to conceive a more enchanting scene than that which\r\nnow met my anxious eye.  Through several ravines the water, pouring\r\nover moss-grown stones, fell in miniature cascades, with a musical\r\nmurmur, over rocks shaded by low trees, and grey with variegated mosses\r\nand the elegant maiden's hair.  Large trunks of trees, thrown down by\r\nthe hand of time, lay covered with fungi waved with various hues.  The\r\nscene was altogether such as might for a time engage the attention and\r\nabstract the mind of one plunged into the abyss of grief.  I was deeply\r\nimpressed with its beauty, and it powerfully excited sensations of\r\ndelight; but as I continued to contemplate it, a sense of loneliness\r\ncrept over me; there was no one near to hear me exclaim, \"How\r\nexquisitely enchanting! how sublime! yet how soft and harmonizing is it\r\nto the feelings.\"\r\n\r\nTurning from this scene I found my grief considerably modified in its\r\nintensity; and I began now to look on my case only as that of a lost\r\nchild in society, whom the parents would be certain of finding on\r\ndiligent search.\r\n\r\n\"God tempers the wind to the shorn lamb,\" and in a thousand mysterious\r\nways prepares the minds of his creatures to meet the burdens they are\r\ncalled upon to bear.  Of this truth I was early convinced.  Had the\r\nnight of my first day's loneliness closed on me in the full\r\nconsciousness of my desolation and self-dependence for preservation, it\r\nis impossible to say what dreadful effects might have been wrought on\r\nthe mind of one so young, and so tenderly brought up.  But it was\r\nordered otherwise.  The want of sleep the previous night, together with\r\nagonised moments of distress, and fears which returned with redoubled\r\nforce as the day progressed and no relief came, all contributed so much\r\nto the exhaustion of my frame, that long ere the curtains of night were\r\ndrawn over the forest, I involuntarily fell into a profound sleep,\r\nunconscious at what hour, or where I had lain myself.  I was thus\r\nspared those feelings of dread which, if night had overtaken my waking\r\nmoments, might have overshadowed my reason while I was watching the\r\nfinal departure of daylight.\r\n\r\nWhen I awoke the next morning, it was broad day; and nothing, while\r\nmemory retains her seat, can obliterate or weaken the impressions I\r\nreceived on opening my eyes.  There was presented to my view the most\r\nmagnificent scene perhaps ever beheld in this world of nature's\r\nproductions.  For a time I imagined myself dreaming of fairy-land.\r\nBefore me, as I reclined on a mossy bed of green herbage, as soft as\r\neider-down, there was an opening in the wood, shaped like an\r\namphitheatre, with the sun's rays throwing a flood of light into it.\r\nTrees rich with foliage and blossoms waved like a galaxy of\r\nparti-coloured flags or banners at a jubilee of nature; brilliant\r\ncolours, varied in endless hues, all beautifully harmonising, so that\r\neach was seen without any being predominant.  Here arose upright\r\nflowers on stupendous branches, towering aloft as if aspiring to reach\r\nthe sun; there others hung pendulously, as if seeking to hide\r\nthemselves amidst the rich foliage that cradled their birth, and were\r\nanxious in their modest delicacy, to avoid the god of day.  Birds of\r\never-varied plumage, sizes, and habits, were congregated in immense\r\nnumbers, forming an orchestra of thousands of vocalists, as if met to\r\ncelebrate the hour of creation.\r\n\r\nA small glassy lake in the centre of the glade, peopled with\r\nwater-fowl, served the songsters for a grace-cup, each quitting the\r\nsprays to dip its beak into it, and again resume its perch to pour\r\nforth a torrent of musical notes.  I know not how long I might have\r\nlain rapt with delight, had not some husks fallen on my face, and\r\nroused me.  I have reason to think that I was pelted by monkeys, whose\r\njealousy at the appearance of a stranger in their territories had\r\naroused their indignation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The nut-hatch in the gum tree]\r\n\r\nEntranced as I had been by the scene, the grosser appetite admonished\r\nme that food was necessary for the sustenance of the body; I had not\r\ntasted it for upwards of twenty-four hours, and the demands of the\r\nstomach now became imperative.  Without allowing myself time to\r\nreflect, the horror of starvation presented itself to my imagination,\r\nand I was again relapsing into despondency, when I saw several small\r\nbirds running up and down the trunk of a large tree, in a spiral\r\ncourse; their movement was so rapid, that I could not distinguish\r\nwhether their heads or tails were uppermost.  Curious to obtain a\r\nnearer view of them, I advanced, and observed that they frequently\r\ntapped the bark with their beaks, and then inserted them into the\r\ninterstices; this led me to examine the tree more closely, when I\r\ndiscovered large masses of gum protruding from the bark.  This\r\ndescription of bird is named the nuthatch.  They were in search of\r\ninsects and their eggs, not of the gum.  I however filled my pocket\r\nwith it, and putting piece after piece into my mouth, as it dissolved,\r\nit allayed for the present the cravings of hunger.\r\n\r\nFrequently when distant dreaded danger is more nearly approached, our\r\nfears vanish, and it often happens that a supposed coming evil turns\r\nout to be a benefit.  At all times, however, the mind is soon\r\nfamiliarised to those dangers that partake of the inevitable.  The very\r\nworst had now passed away from me--the first night's sleep alone in the\r\nforest.  I was safe, unhurt, refreshed, and even cheerful: perhaps\r\nbecause I was still full of the hope of being sought for and found by\r\nmy father and friends.\r\n\r\nIt was the will of Divine Providence that I should for several weeks\r\ncherish this hope; nor did I abandon the flattering solace till I had\r\nbecome fully initiated into the ways of providing for myself.  Indeed,\r\nI may affirm that hope never left me--hope, if not of meeting directly\r\nwith my friends, of emancipating myself from the intricacies of the\r\nforest.  Hope, Memory, and Imagination, three lovely sisters, were my\r\ncompanions, and even in the wilds of a forest,\r\n\r\n  \"Hope enchanted, smiled, and waved her golden hair.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMemory, a visionary slumber, with half-closed eyes, was frequently\r\ndispelled by the hard necessity there was to be up and stirring for\r\nimmediate self-preservation.  Imagination came with lamp-like eyes, a\r\nbright and bold beauty, seating me at one bound or flight in the midst\r\nof my family, enjoying all the comforts of civilized life, throwing me\r\ninto the arms of my mother, indulging in her warm embrace.  Remorse\r\nwould then supervene--remorse for the pain and anguish I had occasioned\r\nmy fond and worthy parents, and for the misery my waywardness had\r\nbrought upon myself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Efforts to escape]\r\n\r\nMy first meal, as I have stated, when left to cater for myself,\r\nconsisted of gum, of which I had a store in my pocket.  As soon,\r\ntherefore, as I had satisfied myself with the surrounding objects of\r\nadmiration, I thought of making another effort to regain the spot where\r\nI had left my parents: it was a vain hope, but I pursued it throughout\r\nthe day, during which I must have travelled many miles.  In the course\r\nof my peregrinations, I found abundance of fruit and nuts, which lay\r\nstrewed in my way.  Late in the day, I met with a mass of the\r\nbush-rope, and, ignorant of its abundance, I at once jumped to the\r\nconclusion that I had arrived at the identical spot which our party had\r\nbefore passed.  This barrier, as it is designated, to my view was\r\nconsiderably extended; and then my heart, after being elevated with\r\nhope, again sunk within me.  Still, however, disinclined to relinquish\r\nhope, my only solace, I soon persuaded myself that I might not, on the\r\nformer occasion, have accurately surveyed it; and I resolved, as night\r\nwas fast approaching, to remain on the spot till the following morning,\r\nand from thence to make a fresh start, to find, if possible, the track\r\nin which the party were travelling.\r\n\r\nIn social life, provident thoughts rarely trouble a youth of thirteen\r\nyears of age; his parents, or others, think for him, and generally\r\nevery night provide a bed for his resting-place.  Such had been\r\npreviously my case; the reader will, therefore, not be surprised that,\r\nup to this moment, I had not bestowed a thought on how I was to pass\r\nthe ensuing night in security.  I was, however, now fairly inducted\r\ninto the school of hard necessity; and as the day was fast waning, I\r\nhad no time to lose.  Acting on impulse, I commenced climbing the\r\nbush-rope, intending there to make my bed, but the dread of falling\r\ncame over me, and checked my resolution.  I then thought of a hollow\r\ntree, many of which I had seen in the course of my perambulations.\r\nFollowing this suggestion of the mind, I immediately began a search for\r\none, and fortunately met with it on the spot.  Night was, however,\r\nsetting in so rapidly, that I had no time to be nice in my choice.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The jaguar]\r\n\r\nThe tree that seemed most to invite me to enter into its interior was\r\npartly uprooted, leaning its head towards the earth, so that I could\r\nrest in a sloping position; but thinking the opening of the decayed\r\npart too wide for perfect security, I stripped off the bark on the\r\nreverse side, of which to form a shutter, or loose door, which I might\r\npull towards the opening when fairly ensconced within the hollow.\r\nHaving thus prepared my bed, I instinctively cast a look round, as an\r\nundefinable sense of danger crept over me; the first movement brought\r\nmy eyes in contact with those of a large jaguar, the tiger of that\r\ncountry.  He was standing upright, about eight yards distant,\r\napparently surveying me from head to foot.  I was paralyzed with fear,\r\nand remained fixed to the spot; the animal gave me a second and third\r\nlook, then took two or three bounds, and was out of sight in an\r\ninstant.  It is to this moment my fixed opinion, one confirmed by\r\nsubsequent experience, that I owe my life to the passive manner in\r\nwhich I stood, and which was occasioned by fright; the slightest\r\nmovement on my part would have occasioned alarm in the jaguar, and\r\nproved fatal.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the jaguar's prowess, he is little less formidable than\r\nthe Bengal tiger: cows and young bulls he destroys with ease and\r\navidity; but the horse is his favourite prey.  All these large animals\r\nhe kills by leaping on their backs, placing one paw upon their head,\r\nanother on the muzzle, and thus contriving, in a moment, to break the\r\nneck of his victim.  The jaguar, although as ferocious as the tiger,\r\nrarely attacks man unprovoked, or unless very hungry; but in general he\r\nfinds no scarcity of food in the regions in which I was located.\r\n\r\nI now debated with myself whether I should enter the tree, foolishly\r\nimagining that the animal designed to take me asleep.  At length the\r\ngloominess of the night enshrouded me in darkness, and left me no\r\nalternative but to spring into my cabin, and pull the pieces of bark\r\nbefore the aperture.  I will not attempt to describe the fearful\r\ntrepidation in which I was placed: the darkness of the night rendered\r\nthe hollow of the tree like a tomb, and I viewed it as a coffin; every\r\nmovement of a twig was, to my imagination, the jaguar removing my\r\nbarricade with an intention of clawing me out for prey.  The scene was\r\nrendered more horrible by the contrast with that of the morning, to\r\nwhich the mind would revert, in spite of surrounding horrors--one was\r\nthe reality of the fabled Elysium, the other that of the Tartarean\r\nfields.  Just as I had thought I had now experienced the acme of\r\nterrors, my fright was augmented by something fluttering round my head,\r\nthe noise from which seemed as if an animal was struggling to\r\ndisentangle itself from a snare.  Shakspere, describing the effects of\r\nfright, speaks of its causing\r\n\r\n  \"Each particular hair to stand on end,\r\n  Like quills upon the fretful porcupine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI will not affirm that the hairs of my head rose to that height, but I\r\nmay safely aver that no mortal had ever more cause for exhibiting all\r\nthe known symptoms of extreme fright.  In a second or two after I heard\r\nthe fluttering, I received repeated blows on the head and face,\r\nindubitable proofs that I had a quarrelsome fellow lodger.  Present and\r\nimmediate dangers chase all others.  I kicked away my temporary\r\nshutter; but before I could make my exit I felt, by the motion of the\r\nair, that a living thing had passed me in rapid flight.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The terrors of night in the forest]\r\n\r\nWhen the sharer of my tenement had flown, I began to consider that it\r\nmust have been some night-bird; and as the jaguar was still uppermost\r\nin my thoughts, I lost no time in repossessing myself of my lodging.\r\nWorn out as I now again was with the fatigues of the day and the\r\nterrors of the night, after a time I was dropping to sleep, when I was\r\nonce more roused by the growl of the jaguar, as if he had just seized\r\nhis prey, and half the beasts of the forest, from the noise there was,\r\nhad collected to contend and fight for the carnage.  A short interval\r\nelapsed, and then the growling changed gradually into death-groanings.\r\nI was now in the midst of a scene of horror and darkness that may well\r\nbe said to elude the power of verbal description.  Only a few hours\r\npreviously my mind had been harmonized by the soft and elegant forms of\r\nnature's richest beauties, under a clear blue sky.  How changed was now\r\nthe scene! how deformed and disfigured was the aspect!  It was a\r\ntransition from Paradise to Erebus; environed by all the real and\r\nconceivable monsters in nature.  I had before been alarmed--I now\r\nabandoned myself to the one sensation of unmitigated despair, the\r\nextremity of which was so intense, that it is a miracle reason held her\r\nplace, or that I survived to write this narrative.\r\n\r\nIndeed, nothing but the turn my thoughts took at this crisis could have\r\npreserved me.  I had already undergone all the horrors of an agonizing\r\nand protracted death, and was well nigh insensible to grief or pain,\r\nwhen, providentially, in the last extremity, I was inwardly admonished\r\nto appeal to my God.  And now, with suppliant accents and upraised\r\nhands, I prayed to Heaven for a blessing, for short I still thought was\r\nthe space between life and death.  Praying with fervency of soul, I\r\ngradually became inspired with confidence; my mind became more tranquil\r\nand fitter for calm consideration.  It occurred to me, notwithstanding\r\nthe horrible din of noises around, that I was still unhurt; that if the\r\njaguar had really selected me for his prey, he would have seized me\r\nwhen within his reach, and not have restrained his appetite for the\r\nmere gratification of tearing me from the hollow of a tree.  Then, in\r\nreference to the sharer of my apartment, I began to look on myself as\r\nthe real aggressor.  Had I not ejected some native of the forest, whose\r\nnatural home it was, both by right and possession; had I not most\r\nunwarrantably intruded on his privacy, and frightened an inoffensive\r\nmember of the sylvan community.\r\n\r\nThus, through the medium of prayer, was I at once enabled and taught\r\nhow to face danger; and whilst looking it steadfastly in the\r\ncountenance, to ascertain correctly its magnitude, and banish\r\nchimerical fears.  That I was surrounded with danger, I was still\r\nconscious; but now I offered up thanks to God for preserving me in the\r\nmidst of them; for having directed me to a place of security, and\r\nprovided me with a strong tower, where I might almost defy enemies.\r\nThus recovering my self-possession, I began really to enjoy the\r\ninterior of the tree as a very comfortable resting-place and a complete\r\nsnuggery.  Very soon after this state of mind was brought about, I fell\r\nasleep, and awoke refreshed and tranquil.  Morning was announced to my\r\nglad eyes by lines of light passing from the lofty trees, scintillating\r\nthrough the holes of my worm-eaten shutter--lines of light which were\r\ndelicately drawn by the golden fingers of Phoebus, the most famed of\r\nartists.  A very considerable portion of the sufferings of mankind have\r\ntheir source in ignorance: nearly all that I encountered, even from\r\nthis memorable night to the hour of my emancipation from the forest,\r\nwas the result of my want of experience.  Had I known that the noises\r\nwhich had disturbed my rest were but the imitations of the red monkey,\r\nI might have slept in quietude.  These animals assemble, and at times\r\namuse themselves throughout the night by making the most horrible\r\nnoises, more especially mimicking the growlings and roarings of the\r\nmore ferocious animals.  I say amuse themselves; but at the same time I\r\nmay remark that all sounds given out by quadrupeds, birds, or reptiles,\r\nare designed to effect some of nature's especial purposes.  Some, for\r\ntheir own protection; others, to caution weaker animals against\r\napproaching danger.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Monkey tricks]\r\n\r\nThe gift and propensity the red monkey has of imitating the beasts of\r\nprey, may deter some enemy from attacking him in the dark; for it is\r\nobserved they cease their mocking habits when daylight appears.  They\r\nmay also warn the timid animals when others of a formidable nature and\r\nferocious appetite are in their vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe jaguar, as we have said, was in the immediate neighbourhood that\r\nnight.  Among the general community of the monkey tribes, morning and\r\nevening are periods they generally select to settle their public\r\naffairs, for the noises they make at these times are absolutely\r\nstunning, and to strangers very alarming.  The forest is their citadel,\r\nwhere, mounted on lofty trees waving in the breeze, they confabulate,\r\nand, as naturalists have often described, arm themselves with sticks\r\nand stones, and in conscious independence defy all intruders.\r\n\r\nThe red monkey, however, is the most pugnacious of the whole species;\r\nand it was some months before I was permitted to walk the woods in\r\npeace, for these animals frequently assailed me with a stick or a\r\nstone.  Policy led me to take all their insults patiently; and in the\r\nend, I imagine, they passed an act of naturalization, for I was\r\nultimately permitted to range the forest without molestation.\r\n\r\nI once witnessed a peculiar instance of their tenaciousness in regard\r\nto their territory.  An European boat was passing down a river on the\r\nside of a wood, when, on a signal being given by one of these animals,\r\nothers crowded to the spot in such numbers as literally to cover the\r\ntrees, bending with their weight the branches to the water's edge.\r\n\r\nAt first they appeared as if amused with the sight of the movement of\r\nthe rowers; then deeming them intruders, they commenced a general\r\npelting, discharging showers of stones and broken sticks.  The people\r\nin the boats fired; when the monkeys pelted more furiously than before,\r\nand though numbers fell wounded, or dead, still they continued the\r\ncontest till the boats passed beyond their domain.\r\n\r\nI now entered on the third day of my sylvan probation, and upon the\r\nwhole, felt more self-possession than I had any right to expect, under\r\nall the circumstances of my forlorn case.  This day, like all others,\r\nwaned with a quick and silent foot, while I again rambled round the\r\nimmediate locality of my resting-place, fearing I might, if I strayed\r\nfar away, be constrained to face the perils of a night in the open air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The blood-sucker]\r\n\r\nThis night I took possession of my lodging in good time, and, as I\r\nthought, carefully fenced myself with an impregnable barrier; and, as I\r\nthought so, it was the same as if it had been a high stone-wall, for it\r\nremoved my perturbation, and occasioned me to sleep soundly.  When I\r\nawoke the following morning, I was surprised to find my stocking matted\r\nwith coagulated blood; I hastened to a rill of water, where I had the\r\nday before previously allayed my thirst, to draw it off and cleanse the\r\nfoot.  To my utter astonishment and dismay, I discovered that my shoe\r\nwas in every part stained with blood, and that the toes and the sole of\r\nthe right foot were stiff with coagulum.\r\n\r\nDivesting myself of the covering of my foot, I observed a small wound\r\non the instep, not unlike the mark made by a leech.  Imagining that I\r\nhad been bitten by some formidable insect, such as I had seen in the\r\ncourse of our journey, when I had washed myself and recovered my\r\nfright, I hastened back to scrape out the interior of my chamber with a\r\nstick.  In performing this work I disturbed myriads of small insects\r\nwith which I had rested, but nothing that could account for the bite on\r\nmy foot.  Pleased, however, at having discovered the necessity there\r\nwas for cleanliness in my apartment.  I was resolved to give it a\r\nthorough scouring; and for this purpose thrust the stick up a hollow\r\narm of the tree above my head, when out flew an extraordinary large\r\nbat.  It was some satisfaction to become acquainted with those who are\r\nlikely to become the sharers of your lodging, and I had no doubt the\r\nbat was the animal that flew against my face when endeavouring to set\r\nout the previous evening on his usual nocturnal rambles.\r\n\r\nStill I remained in a state of ignorance as to the cause of the wound\r\nin my foot.  It requires much study and considerable experience, even\r\nto ascertain the causes of only a few effects in the phenomena of\r\nnature's workshop.  Unwilling to leave the uninformed reader in doubt,\r\nnot only in this particular instance, but in numerous others that will\r\nbe met with in the course of this narrative, I shall anticipate, as it\r\nwere, my own subsequent experience, and explain, when I can, the causes\r\nof certain effects that occurred to me while living alone in the\r\nforest.  It was a species of bat, named by naturalists the vampire,\r\nthat I had ejected, and he it was who had bled me so freely in the foot.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that this bloodsucker, when once he has fastened on an\r\nanimal, is allowed to satiate his appetite unmolested, as its victims\r\nall remain quiet and unresisting during the time he makes his meal.  It\r\nis said that vampires flap their wings and produce a cooling sensation\r\nthat lulls their prey to sleep while they suck their fill.\r\n\r\nIn the instance of myself, I had not awoke the whole night, and was\r\nperfectly unconscious of the attack, until morning; but, as I have\r\nalready said, I was in nature's great school, and soon learnt that, as\r\nin the moral world, so it is in the woods, there is more to dread from\r\ninsidious attacks, than from open and declared enemies.\r\n\r\nWhen I had satisfied my appetite, on leaving my resting-place, with\r\nnuts and fruit, I sat down by the rill of water, to consider more\r\ndeterminately than I had hitherto done, what were my prospects, and\r\nwhat course of conduct I should pursue for my own protection.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The battle of the snakes]\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged in thought, my attention was attracted to a snake,\r\nonly a few yards' distance from where I sat; it was near a patch of\r\nbrushwood, and was apparently trembling with fear.  Almost as soon as I\r\nhad noticed its state of alarm, another snake, with astonishing\r\ncelerity, sprung upon it, and seized it by the neck, then encircled\r\nitself about six folds round the body of its victim, like the worm of a\r\nscrew.  The assailant then, leaning its head over the other, looked its\r\ngasping foe in the face, to ascertain the effect of the coils round the\r\nbody; and seeing that its prey was still alive, it multiplied the coils\r\nthree or four times, and evidently tightened the screw, watching all\r\nthe time to see the effect of the extra coils.  The attacking party was\r\nan animal designated the black snake, and the victim was a rattlesnake,\r\nabout three and a half feet long, its enemy being about the same\r\nlength.  The former, however, had perfect command over the latter; but\r\nI was surprised at the length of time the executioner took to satisfy\r\nhimself that his work of death was performed.  The black snake remained\r\nthree-quarters of an hour coiled round the other, and then very slowly\r\nand cautiously slackened one coil at a time, narrowly watching if any\r\nsigns of life yet remained, ready to resume the screw again, if\r\nnecessary, to complete the destruction of the victim.\r\n\r\nDriving the live snake away, I obtained possession of the dead one: it\r\nwas four years old, which I scarce need mention was known by the number\r\nof rattles in its tail, which make a rattling noise when these reptiles\r\nare in motion.\r\n\r\nThe rattlesnake is not among the most active of the species of snakes:\r\nit never springs a greater distance than its own length, which rarely\r\nexceeds four feet.  It is owing to this that the black snake has the\r\nadvantage, being able to spring from a greater distance on its prey,\r\nand, from its rapid motion and method of seizure to deprive it at once\r\nof the power of injecting its venom.\r\n\r\nI have since seen the rattlesnake destroyed by bucks in the open plain,\r\nand that without risk of suffering from the fatal effects of its bite.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The buck and the rattlesnake]\r\n\r\nA buck, when he discovers a rattlesnake, immediately prepares to attack\r\nit as a dreaded enemy, while he will pass other snakes unnoticed.  The\r\nbuck, depending on his sharp bifurcated hoofs, with which to sever the\r\nbody of his adversary, is very skilful in his manoeuvre.  He approaches\r\nthe snake to within about ten feet, and then makes a bound, cutting the\r\nsnake down with his hoofs with such unerring celerity and fatality as\r\nrarely leaves any chance of escape.\r\n\r\nThe two incidents of the vampire and the snakes threw my mind into a\r\nstate of reflection on the system of nature which makes the existence\r\nof one animal depend on another for its subsistence.  Then my thoughts\r\nreverted to the number of living things I had myself to dread,\r\nseparated as I was from society where men unite for mutual protection.\r\nI had seen in the case of the chegoe, that a very small insect could\r\ninflict a severe injury on the human frame, and I had narrowly escaped\r\nbeing carried off by the jaguar.  Snakes, serpents, and enormous\r\nlizards, crossed my path at almost every step, and the monkeys pelted\r\nme.\r\n\r\nUneasy and restless, I rose on my feet, to wander I knew not whither; I\r\nproceeded forward as if running from danger, yet dreading it at every\r\nstep as I advanced.  Presently my progress was impeded by a broad piece\r\nof expanded network, such as, from appearance, might have been\r\nmanufactured by the hand of man,--it was spread from tree to tree.  In\r\nthe network was a small bird struggling to free itself from the toil\r\nwhich had ensnared it.  Thinking I had now crossed the path of fowlers,\r\nmy heart leaped with joy, and I flattered myself that deliverance was\r\nat hand; yet, fearing to spoil their sport, I drew back, and took up a\r\nposition behind a tree.  My mind was soon disabused of the error into\r\nwhich I had fallen.  Several spiders of enormous size approaching the\r\ncaptive, I sprang forward to release the bird, and then perceived that\r\nthe netting was the work of insects.  The captive proved to be a\r\nhumming bird, one of those beautiful little creatures that are fabled\r\nto feed on the nectar of plants.  They however feed on insects, those\r\nwhich are attached to the nectarium of plants: these they seize for\r\nfood with their long bills.\r\n\r\nThe spiders that weave these extraordinary webs from one tree to\r\nanother, are not, like those of Europe, of solitary habits, but live in\r\ncommunities; they mutually share in the labour of forming the web, and\r\ndivide the prey they catch.  It is worthy of notice that all animals\r\nwho unite their labour, possess infinitely more ingenuity in their\r\nproceedings than those who work individually.  The weak, however, are\r\ngenerally provided with some compensating, self-protecting secret, that\r\nenables them to rear their young in as much security as the strong.\r\nMany insects that execute their buildings in trees, and there collect\r\nprovisions for their infant colony in fear of the depredations of\r\nbirds, cover the extremity of their store with substances of nauseous\r\ntaste.  Having saved the elegant little bird from the voracious\r\nspiders, I could not resist giving it freedom.\r\n\r\nThe web which had impeded my progress brought to my recollection the\r\nbush-rope, which I had previously proposed to examine by daylight, in\r\nthe hope of falling into the original track my family had taken through\r\nthe forest.  After having spent the whole of the subsequent part of the\r\nday in surveying the barrier and its approaches, I was reluctantly\r\nconstrained again to take up my position in the hollow of the tree,\r\nunder the firm conviction that I had no clue by which I could, for the\r\npresent, at least, emancipate myself from the mazes of the forest.  I\r\nretired to rest much depressed, and half disposed to abandon myself to\r\ndespair.  I, however, got some sleep at intervals, notwithstanding the\r\nrenewal of the frightful noises heard the first night; and, upon the\r\nwhole, on the approach of morning, found myself somewhat resigned to my\r\nfate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Preparations for defence]\r\n\r\nPossessing an excellent pocket-knife, I now thought of cutting a good\r\nstaff, and, if occasion should render it necessary, of defending myself\r\nwith it against any assailant.  How it happened that I had not thought\r\nof this before surprised me; and I acquired new confidence from the\r\nconsideration that I possessed some means of defence.  While trimming\r\nmy staff, the history of Crusoe occurred to my recollection; and I then\r\nresolved to adopt his mode of registering time by making notches on the\r\nstick; and this employment brought home to my recollection that I had\r\nnow been lost four days, and, while so engaged, that the present day\r\nwas a Sabbath.\r\n\r\nThe last notch I cut longitudinally, that I might mark the Sundays, and\r\nthus chronicle the return of the one day to be kept holy.  Having\r\nalways been accustomed religiously to observe the Sabbath, the current\r\nof my thoughts now took another turn.  My first act was to offer up\r\nprayers, and to petition God to infuse into my breast courage to face\r\nthe trials I must necessarily undergo in the wilderness, and ask for\r\nhis guiding finger in all my wanderings.\r\n\r\nAlter performing this duty, I sat down on a fallen tree to court\r\nreflection, and presently heard a humming noise close to my ear.\r\nTurning round, to see from whence it proceeded, I thought I recognised\r\nthe identical bird that I had, a short time before, liberated from the\r\nspider's web.  It appeared, at first, to be stationary in the air, and\r\nI marvelled how it was supported; it then occurred to me that it was a\r\nspiritual messenger, sent in the form of the little creature I had been\r\nkind to, as an assurance of divine protection.  Full ten minutes I\r\ncontemplated the bird in this light, when it flew away, leaving me in a\r\nmuch happier state of mind than I had hitherto felt myself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Utility of birds]\r\n\r\nThe fixed position of the bird I afterwards found to be its habit when\r\nhovering over certain flowers in search of insects.  There are a great\r\nvariety of the humming-bird tribe; the one I had caught was very\r\nbeautiful, and moved its wings with such astonishing rapidity in flight\r\nas to elude the eye; and when poising itself over a flower, waiting to\r\nattack insects as they enter between the petals, the wings moved with\r\nsuch celerity as to become almost invisible, like a mist.  The habits\r\nof these birds may be denominated fly-like:--\r\n\r\n  \"When morning dawns, and the blest sun again\r\n  Lifts his red glories from the eastern main,\r\n  Then round our woodbines, wet with glittering dews,\r\n  The flower-fed humming-bird his round pursues,--\r\n  Sips with inserted tube the honied blooms,\r\n  And chirps his gratitude as round he roams.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBirds, throughout my sojourn in the forest, were my chief and most\r\ncheerful companions.  They seem to be sent by Heaven as the peculiar\r\nassociates of man; they exhilarate him in his labour, and brighten his\r\nhours of leisure by their melody.  They also, in an especial manner,\r\nserve man, by preventing the increase of those insects that would\r\nconsume the products of his industry.  Whatever the uninformed farmer\r\nor gardener may say on this head, I beg to assure them that the\r\ndepredations birds commit are more than compensated by their\r\ninsectivorous habits.\r\n\r\nThere is not a vegetable production, cultivated or of spontaneous\r\ngrowth, from the forest tree to the most tender garden-flower, that is\r\nnot liable to attacks from myriads of insects, though small in form and\r\nweapons, yet insidious in their mode of attack, and fatal to the plant.\r\nBirds are the natural enemies of insects, and were sent as a check upon\r\ntheir increase.  Man persecutes the bird for plundering his fruits,\r\nseeds, and grain crops, but he does not enquire whether he would have\r\nany of these productions if the bird did not free the ground and buds\r\nfrom insects.  The late Professor Bradley ascertained that a pair of\r\nsparrows, during the time they had young ones, destroyed on an average\r\n3360 caterpillars every week, besides butterflies.\r\n\r\nMan, when he clears and cultivates the land, destroys the winter food\r\nof birds, cutting down the trees that nature intended should supply\r\nthem with berries during a season when their insectivorous habits are\r\nsuspended.  It would be an advantage to those who are engaged in\r\ncultivating the earth, if they studied the harmony of nature a little\r\nmore than they now generally do.  The farmer will say that a hard and\r\nlong frost is good for the land, because it kills the insects; so\r\nlikewise do the birds die off in severe seasons of cold, thus reducing\r\nthe number of his auxiliary agriculturists to the proportion in which\r\nthey will be required, on the return of spring, to keep the land clear\r\nfrom insects, and secure a crop to the cultivator.  Birds in general\r\nreturn tenfold to man, in the services they render him, for all they\r\ntake from his store; while they,\r\n\r\n          ----\"With melody untaught,\r\n  Turn all the air to music, within hearing,\r\n  Themselves unseen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe humming-bird's visit, together with the peculiar associations of my\r\nmind at the time, produced in me a calmness that partook of heaven.\r\nThe scene--a picture, too,--which was before me, was one of those\r\nbeautiful instances of nature's chaste compositions that combined all\r\naround in harmony.  Lovely were the sylvan flowers, fresh with\r\nblossoms, rising amidst the soft and matted growth beneath; and how\r\nexquisite the structure of the moss and lichen within my reach; how\r\ncalm, how clear and serene was the air--how deepened were the\r\nshadows--how perfect was the quiet--how eloquent the silence!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Solitary reflections]\r\n\r\nMy meditations were painfully broken in upon by the mind reverting to\r\nthe jaguar that I thought at times was lurking about to devour me; then\r\nto the snakes, and the captive humming-bird.  \"Has God,\" I\r\ninvoluntarily exclaimed, \"made all his creatures that they may devour\r\neach other?  Yes, yes! he has.\"  I continued, as I rose with disturbed\r\nfeelings; \"I see the scheme of destruction at every step, and behold it\r\nat every turn; both day and night, every hour, yea, every moment,\r\nmillions are struggling in the death-grasp of their foes.\"\r\n\r\nThese reflections almost melted my heart, when, casting up my eyes to\r\nheaven, as if to ask for some light to shine on my mind and explain the\r\nsubject, I saw a falcon, in the act of flying, seize a bird of the\r\npigeon kind, and fly off with it into the woods.  Tears came to my\r\nrelief.  Goldsmith says, \"The mere uninformed spectator passes on in\r\ngloomy silence; while the naturalist, in every plant, in every insect,\r\nand in every pebble, finds something to entertain his curiosity and\r\nexcite his speculation.  In the animal kingdom alone there exists\r\nnearly one hundred thousand of known different subjects, and half that\r\nnumber of different plants.  The discovery of almost every vegetable\r\nbrings with it the knowledge of a new insect.  In the mineral kingdom\r\nthe compositions and forms are almost endless.\"  And Dr. Priestley\r\nsays, of scientific pursuits \"The investigation of nature cannot fail\r\nto be valuable.  It engages all our intellectual faculties to the\r\ngreatest extent, and in its pursuit the general stock of useful\r\nknowledge is increased.  The field for inquiry is rational, extensive,\r\nand profitable, beyond conception.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what right have I, a poor, short-sighted mortal,\" I then\r\nexclaimed, \"to seek for the motives that actuate an all-wise Deity?  It\r\nis not only vain but wicked in man to scrutinize the ways of\r\nProvidence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nI BUILD MYSELF A HUT--THE SCENERY THROUGHOUT A DAY IN THE FOREST\r\nDESCRIBED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"O may I with myself agree,\r\n  And never covet what I see;\r\n  Content me with a humble shade--\r\n  My passions tamed, my wishes laid;\r\n  For while our wishes wildly roll,\r\n  We banish quiet from the soul.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Projects of building]\r\n\r\nAs the first Sabbath-day in the woods closed upon me, I felt more\r\nresigned to my fate, and more composed, than I had been at any previous\r\nperiod since the separation from my parents.  I now looked on myself as\r\na denizen of the forest; and as I slowly repaired to the hollow tree,\r\nthe thought possessed me that I could construct some kind of\r\ndwelling-place.  During the night I formed and rejected fifty plans for\r\ncarrying this scheme out.  At length, just as morning dawned, a simple\r\nmethod suggested itself to me of effecting my purpose; and, with my\r\nusual ardour, I commenced the work forthwith.  Before the evening set\r\nin I had collected, and trimmed with my pocket-knife, a considerable\r\nnumber of stakes, about four feet long, at which work I continued for\r\nfour days, when it occurred to me that I had not yet given the\r\neligibility of site a thought, and had been much too hasty in my\r\nproceedings.  Ashamed of my own impetuosity and want of consideration,\r\nI crept to rest, very weary and ill at ease with myself; and as I took\r\na retrospective view of the results of my impulsive mode of acting on\r\nthe thought, together with the ills I had brought on my own head, I did\r\nnot spare self-reproach.  Considering my numerous wants, it was\r\nclearly, where I had collected the stakes, a very inconvenient spot to\r\nchoose for a permanent place of residence.  Weighing in my judgment the\r\nkind of locality suited to the purpose, I decided on an open space or\r\nglade in the forest, where I might have a clear view all around, and be\r\nout of the way of uprooted or falling timber.  But for this last\r\nconsideration I should at once have selected the spot where I awoke\r\nafter my first night's sleep in the forest.  The recollection of that\r\nbeautiful scene reminded me of another thing I had not hitherto thought\r\nof, namely, that my house must be built near to a supply of water, and\r\nalso of fruit.  The next day, therefore, was spent in searching for a\r\nsite on which I might commence my building speculation.  There was no\r\nlack of space, or of glades; but in the resolution I had now made to\r\nbecome thoughtful, and act with caution, I fear I became too nice and\r\nfastidious.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The forest stream]\r\n\r\nOne open plot of ground I traversed many times with the eye of a\r\ngovernment surveyor: it was the very thing itself; but there was no\r\nwater to be seen.  Presently, I caught the sound of trickling water;\r\nand my new friend, caution, forsook me.  I was so heedless in running\r\nto satisfy myself that there actually was a stream fit to drink, that I\r\nwas precipitated headlong into the gill, or chasm, which formed the\r\nchannel for its course.  It was so covered with wood that the eye could\r\nnot see it.  Fortunately I met with this rent in the earth near to the\r\ncommencement of the fissure, where it was comparatively narrow and\r\nshallow.  At any other part, its steepness and depth might have\r\nendangered life.  It was the birthplace of a native stream.  I\r\nsubsequently learned to track it by the soothing harmony of this\r\ninvisible torrent, the notes from which sounded like innumerable broken\r\nfalls, and were softened by ascending through branches which hung over\r\nit.  These sounds were extremely harmonious.\r\n\r\nAt the spot where I had fallen the water might with some difficulty be\r\nobtained, and near to this, at length I determined to build my villa--a\r\nsylvan mansion.  This site, on one side, was flanked by a morass, or\r\nbog, which even then, in the driest season, was only passable with care\r\non tufts of grass, which here and there sprung from the moisture of the\r\nsoil.  Proceeding to lay out my ground-plan, which was a circle, and to\r\nprepare for the morrow, I stayed at work till it was too late to find\r\nmy way back to my lodging; leaving me no alternative but either to\r\nstretch myself on the ground, exposed to numberless dangers, or remain\r\nawake, and protect myself as I might.  In this extremity I thought of\r\nthe chasm, and groping my way to it, found its extreme end, where it\r\nwas a mere slit, into which I rolled, and laid till the return of day.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The hut commenced]\r\n\r\nThe morning opened with its usual bustle of animals, birds, and insects\r\nsummoning me to my labour, and, having commenced, I was surprised to\r\nhear a cry of, \"Who are you?  Who--who are you?\" I had scarcely\r\nrecovered from the astonishment which these words occasioned, when they\r\nwere followed by, \"Work away!--work away!--work away!\" and a mournful\r\ncry of \"Willy come!--go, Willy!  Willy--Willy--come!  Go Willy!\"\r\nLooking up, and being now in an open space, I could plainly see the\r\nbirds fly over my head that uttered these notes.  Not aware that these\r\ncalls are common to certain birds, and my Christian name being William,\r\nthe reader may imagine the effect and surprise with which they were\r\nheard.  I instantly discontinued my labour, conceiving that the birds\r\nhad been influenced by supernatural agency, and that they portended\r\nomens which had a peculiar reference to myself.  This impression filled\r\nme with fears and fantasies of all kinds; it seemed as if some spell\r\nwas on me, and I sat down in melancholy moodiness for the rest of the\r\nday.  Irresolute, the following morning I rather dragged myself than\r\nwalked to the same spot; but as I went, another bird over my head\r\ndistinctly cried out, \"Whip-poor-Will!  Whip-poor-Will!\r\nWhip-poor-Will!\"  Yes! I exclaimed (as my spirits threw off the burden\r\nwhich had oppressed them) I am indeed ashamed of my folly in attending\r\nto the omens of birds.  They are winging their way to the business of\r\nthe day, and why should I neglect mine?  I then returned, and took a\r\nbundle of the prepared stakes on my back to my new settlement.  Need I\r\napologise to the reader for mentioning the trifling incidents which\r\ndepressed me at times, and the manner in which the paroxysms were\r\ndispelled.  My motive in naming them is to illustrate the alternations\r\nmy feelings underwent during my early days of probation in the\r\nwilderness.  I know not whether I had taken a cold, but for some days\r\npast I had now suffered from a pain in my limbs, which I at the time\r\nattributed to the cramped position in which I rested at night.  I\r\ntherefore became extremely anxious to possess a place in which I might\r\nstretch myself at length.  It, however, took seven days to construct\r\nthe internal shell of the hut; for, being determined to sleep in\r\nsecurity, I ultimately doubled the frame of the building.  Having\r\ndriven stakes into the earth, about a foot apart, forming a circle of\r\nabout eight feet in diameter, I interlaced these with the limber\r\nbranches of trees, fastening them to the stakes with tough fibres,\r\nstripped from the bark of lianes.  These shrubs, of which there are a\r\ngreat variety, all comprised under that term, sometimes grow to the\r\nsize of a man's leg round trees, making the trunks look like a mast of\r\na ship furnished with rigging.  They support the trees against the\r\nhurricanes, in the same manner as spurs are placed in the ground to\r\nprop posts; cords are made of their bark stronger than those\r\nmanufactured of hemp.  In woods where timber is felled, it is sometimes\r\nthe practice to cut several hundred trees near their roots, where they\r\nremain till the lianes, which hold them, are also cut.  When this is\r\ndone, one whole part of the wood seems to fall at once, making an\r\nastounding crash.  By the means of the lianes and stakes, I formed a\r\ncircular strong hurdle-kind of fence; on this I fastened a number of\r\nother sticks, like wands, tapering at the top, which, when bound\r\ntogether, met over the centre part of the floor of the hut, and formed\r\na conical roof.  These I also interlaced in the same manner as the\r\nupright stakes; covering the whole with leaves of the parrasalla tree,\r\nwhich the wet does not injure; binding these also down with my most\r\nexcellent substitute for cordage--fibres of the bark of the lianes.  In\r\nthe roof I left a hole for ingress and egress; so that, with two steps\r\nup, and then a jump, I was in the centre of my habitation, where, with\r\ndried grass, I made a most comfortable bed.  This, after all, was a\r\nfrail affair.  My next object was to erect another frame over it, at\r\nabout two feet distance from the interior shell, filling up the space\r\nbetween the upright stakes with stones and dry earth.  The aperture was\r\nsecured at night, leaving only a space for air, with a piece of bark\r\nhung on with the before-named fibres.  With the same material (bark) I\r\nalso formed a kind of stage before the opening into the hut, where I\r\ncould sit, and survey the surrounding scenery.  Some time subsequently\r\nI wove myself a grass hammock, which I found more cleanly than the\r\ndried grass, and less liable to be infested with insects.  Finding\r\nmyself lonely in this structure, I took the resolution of increasing my\r\nfamily; and, with this view, I devoted a portion of the interior for\r\nbirds, that I might not be wholly companionless.  These I took young,\r\nand reared them up in an aviary which I constructed immediately under\r\nmy hammock, letting them out to hop about me when the aperture of the\r\nhut was closed.  Many of my associates repaid me for my care with\r\nstrong proofs of docility and affection.  I also caught two land\r\ntortoises, to occupy the floor of the dwelling, and make me conscious\r\nof other living things besides myself breathing the same air.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The dwellers in the hut]\r\n\r\nIn the foolishness of my heart I thought that when I possessed a hut,\r\nin which I might repose in security, I should be happy.  But alas! in\r\nthe city or in the forest, worldly acquisitions are not always attended\r\nwith contentment.  Man everywhere sighs for something more than he\r\npossesses.\r\n\r\nI had now a hut, one, too, that was impregnable against the attacks of\r\nthe jaguar, or any of the animals of the forest; and, as I thought, in\r\nevery way compactly built to be impervious to noxious insects; but\r\nhappiness or contentment did not abide in it.\r\n\r\nI now wanted a gun, that I ought, man-like, slay, and play the tyrant\r\nover the living things around me.  I grew tired of my vegetable diet,\r\nand daily lamented the want of a fire to cook the eggs, which now began\r\nto form a considerable portion of my food.  These wants gradually, as\r\nthe mind dwelt upon them, became sources of anxiety, and disturbed my\r\nrest.  The animal propensities of my nature began to stir within me.  I\r\nlonged to kill at my pleasure, and live on prey, as did the other\r\nanimals of the forest.  At length I determined on making the best\r\nsubstitute I could for a gun--namely, a bow and arrow; and, like Robin\r\nHood, practise till I could hit the shaft of an arrow placed upright in\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nIt was many weeks subsequently to this resolution before I succeeded in\r\neven procuring the materials I deemed suited for my purpose.  My knife\r\nhaving become blunted with frequent use, it took a length of time to\r\nfashion the bow, and no less than four snapped in two as soon as I\r\nattempted to use them; proving that, choice as I had been in the\r\nselection of my wood, my judgment was defective in this particular.\r\nWhen I had succeeded in forming one of these primitive warlike weapons,\r\nI fastened large butterflies against the hut, and commenced the\r\npractice of archery.\r\n\r\nI have informed the reader that the entrance of the new dwelling was\r\nthrough the roof, where, as I have said, I erected a seat, or\r\nstanding-place; a sort of balcony, or rather, more like a dormer\r\nwindow.  On this, every morning, during the dry season, at daybreak, I\r\ntook my stand to discharge my arrows at any unwary bird that might come\r\nwithin my reach.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Early morning in the forest]\r\n\r\nThis early rising at length grew into a habit, and to watch the opening\r\nof the day gave me unspeakable pleasure; and up to the last day of my\r\npilgrimage it was the most interesting hour to me.  It was an hour when\r\nthe littleness of life did not present itself; the mind being refreshed\r\nwith rest, was prepared to be filled with enlarged ideas.\r\n\r\nThe labourers of the night--for nature has her two sets of working\r\nanimals--were then all on their way to seek retirement and rest during\r\nthe day, from the fatigues of the night; while those that had rested\r\nduring that period were all preparing to hail the morn with innumerable\r\ncries.\r\n\r\nAs twilight glimmers in the east, the tiger-cats are stealing into\r\ntheir holes.  The owl and the goat-sucker cease their mournful lament,\r\nand as streaks of light appear the \"Ha! ha! ha! ha!\" of the latter,\r\neach note lower than the last, sounding like the voice of a murdered\r\nvictim, entirely ceases.  The crickets, also, at this hour begin to\r\nslacken the violence of their chirping, though sometimes in cloudy\r\nweather they will continue their notes for four-and-twenty hours\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe partridge is the first of the birds to give signal of the rising of\r\nthe sun, even before he appears on the horizon; while the mist of the\r\nmorning, that precedes the day, is dispelling, numerous tribes of\r\ninsects are creeping to their hiding-places, as others are issuing\r\nforth to enjoy the day.  Lizards of sparkling lustre, from two inches\r\nto two feet and a-half long, cross the paths of the forest; and the\r\nchameleon has begun to chase the insects round the trunks of trees.\r\nGaudy serpents steal from out of holes or decayed trees.\r\n\r\n  \"Each rapid movement gives a different dye;\r\n  Like scales of burnished gold they dazzling show,\r\n  Now sink to shade, now like a furnace glow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe houton, a bird so called from the sound he gives out, distinctly\r\narticulates \"houton, houton,\" in a plaintive note, as he erects his\r\ncrown, and cuts and trims his tail, with his beak, in the most,\r\nartistical manner, then flies off with a short jerk.\r\n\r\nAt the same period the maam whistles; and when the sun is seen above\r\nthe horizon, the hanaquoi, pataca, maroucli, and all the parrots and\r\nparoquets are prepared to announce his arrival.  Every hour from this\r\nmoment, excepting noon, calls into action new races of animals; and he\r\nwho spends a day in the scene that environed my existence, when seated\r\nat my door, would not know which most to admire,--the forms, hues, or\r\nvoices of the animals presented to his observation; as at intervals,\r\nwonder, admiration, and awe of the power that created them, are forced\r\non the mind.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Forest animals]\r\n\r\nWith the morning's dawn, the monkeys send forth their howl, the\r\ngrasshoppers and locusts chirp, the frogs and toads give out their\r\nnotes.  The hanging pendant wasps' nests, most curious in form, send\r\nforth their inhabitants; myriads of ants issue from their clay-built\r\ntenements, in some places colonized so densely as to cover the foliage\r\nall around.  These, like the species of ants called the termites, that\r\ncast up the earth in mounds, commence their day's journey on roads\r\nconstructed by themselves, some of which are covered, and others open.\r\n\r\nMyriads of the most beautiful beetles buzz in the air, and sparkle like\r\njewels on the fresh and green leaves, or on odorous flowers.  Other\r\ntribes, such as serpents and agile lizards, creep from the hollow of\r\ntrees, or from holes beneath the herbage; many of them exceeding in\r\nsplendour the hue of the flowers.  The major part of these are on their\r\nway to creep up the stems of trees or bushes, there to bask in the sun,\r\nand lie in wait for birds and insects.\r\n\r\nThe most brilliantly coloured butterflies, rivalling in hues the\r\nrainbow, begin to flutter from flower to flower, or collect in parties\r\non the most sunny banks of cooling streams.  There was the blue-white\r\nidia, the large eurilochus with its ocellated wings, the hesperite, the\r\nLaertes, the blue shining Nestor, and the Adonis; these, like birds, in\r\nmost places hovered between the bushes.  The feronia, with rustling\r\nwings, flew rapidly from tree to tree; while the owl, the largest of\r\nthe moth species, sat immovable, with out-spread wings, waiting the\r\napproach of evening.\r\n\r\nAs the day progresses, the life of the scene increases.  Troops of\r\ngregarious monkeys issue from the depths of the forest, their\r\ninquisitive countenances turned towards the verge of their wooded\r\ndomain, making their way for the plantations; all leaping, whistling,\r\nand chattering as they progress from tree to tree.\r\n\r\nParrots, some blue, red, or green, others, parti-coloured, assemble in\r\nlarge groups on the tops of the forest-trees; and then, flying off to\r\nthe plantations, fill the air with their screams.  The toucan, perched\r\non an extreme branch, rattles his large, hollow bill; and in loud,\r\nplaintive notes, calls for rain.  The fly-catcher sits aloof, intent on\r\nwatching insects as they dart from branch to branch, seizing them as\r\nthey heedlessly buzz by him in their giddy and unsteady career.  Other\r\nbirds, of singular form, variety, and superb plumage, flutter by, in\r\nlarge or small parties, or in pairs, and some singly, peopling\r\neverywhere the fragrant bushes.  On the ground are gallinaceans,\r\njacuses, hocuses, and pigeons, that have left the perch to wander under\r\nthe trees, in the moisture, for food.\r\n\r\nIn the tones of the nightingale the manikins are heard in all places,\r\namusing themselves by their sudden change of position, and in\r\nmisleading the sportsman; while the woodpecker makes the distant forest\r\nresound as he strikes the trees.  Super-noisy, above all, is the\r\nuraponga, who, perched on the highest tree he can find, gives out\r\nsounds resembling the strokes of a sledge-hammer on the anvil, deluding\r\nthe wanderer, as it once did me, into a belief that a blacksmith's shop\r\nis near at hand.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mocking-bird]\r\n\r\nEvery living thing, by its action and voice, is seen greeting the\r\nsplendour of the day; while the delicate humming-bird, rivalling, in\r\nbeauty and lustre, diamonds, emeralds, and sapphires, hovers with\r\ninvisible wings over the brightest flowers.  The bird colibri repairs\r\nto the tree called _bois immortel_, when the wild guava ripens its\r\nfruit; and there, also, will be found the Pompadour, both the\r\npurple-breasted and the purple-throated.  At the same hour (day-break),\r\nthe crowing of the hanaquoi sounds like a village-clock, for all to set\r\nto work in the great shop of nature.  Then the cassique, or\r\nmocking-bird, gives out his own short but sweet song, preparatory to\r\nvisiting the plantations, being fond of the haunts of man, where he\r\nremains till evening, making all kinds of noises, from the crowing of a\r\ncock, and the barking of dogs, to the grunting and squeaking of pigs.\r\nThese birds weave their nests near together, in a pendulous manner.\r\nTheir bodies are black, having the rump and half-tail yellow; other\r\nspecies have the rump a bright scarlet.  In form they are a model of\r\nsymmetry.\r\n\r\nAs the feathered tribes, one after the other, adjust their plumage, and\r\ntune their throats, squirrels, in rapid spiral speed, as quick as\r\nthought, are seen descending trees, then darting upon others in\r\nopposite directions, flinging themselves from tree to tree, with\r\namazing exactness; pursuing their mates or their rivals among the mazy\r\nbranches of the trees, with a velocity that eludes the sight.\r\n\r\nEverywhere is nature's secretary, with his pen dipped in intellect,\r\nbusy in writing down the invisible agency of Infinite Wisdom and\r\nAlmighty Power.\r\n\r\n  \"How dazzling is thy beauty! how divine!\r\n  How dim the lustre of the world to thine!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sublimity of the scene, when first beheld, produced unlimited\r\nastonishment; viewed again and again, all was softened down into\r\nharmonious shades of beauty, imparting a pleasure that cannot be\r\nunderstood by mere dwellers amidst the works of man.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Noon in the forest]\r\n\r\nIn the forest, every hour of the night and day is the Creator present\r\nto the eye.  Surrounded by the works of man, we sometimes lose sight of\r\nour Maker, and do not always properly appreciate his attributes.  I\r\nhave said that the morning gives life and activity to myriads of his\r\ncreatures, who declare his power; but not less expressive is the hour\r\nof tranquillity--the hour of noon.  At that hour, all is suddenly\r\nhushed into solemn silence.  Stillness, as if by general consent,\r\nconcert, or word of command, influences all the sylvan communities--a\r\nstillness illumined and made more manifest by the dazzling and burning\r\nbeams of a meridian sun.\r\n\r\nCreation at that hour appears wearied, fatigued, and overcome with the\r\nsplendour of the day; it is as the face of God himself, before whose\r\nglory all things are struck with awe, and pause to acknowledge His\r\nmajesty.  Nothing moves--it is the hour of nature's siesta--yet the\r\nstillness speaks.\r\n\r\n  \"Thy shades, thy silence, now be mine,\r\n    Thy charms my only theme;\r\n  My haunt the hollow cliff whose pine\r\n    Waves o'er the gloomy stream.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quietness is that of a pause in the running stream of time; the air\r\nis motionless, the leaves hang pendant, as waiting in the presence of a\r\ndeity for permission to resume the business of growth.  The silence\r\nthat reigns at the hour of noon is peculiarly of a religious character;\r\nthere is nothing to which it can be compared but itself.  From the\r\nnobles of the forest to the minutest insect, all appear to be at their\r\ndevotions--the propensity to kill, for the time being, is forgotten or\r\nsuspended,--\r\n\r\n  \"The passions to divine repose alone\r\n  Persuaded yield; and love and joy are waking.\"\r\n\r\nIt is as if the naiads and fairies had deserted the sunbeams and fallen\r\nasleep.  Oh! there is a harmony in nature wonderfully attuned to the\r\nintelligence of man, if he would but listen to it.  The hour of noon,\r\nin the woods, is an hour of intellectual transcendentalism; it lifts\r\nthe thoughts beyond the world, and peoples the grove with spirits of\r\nanother world.  Yet is there nothing in motion but the beams of the sun\r\npenetrating the foliage to the base of the trees--\r\n\r\n  \"The chequered earth seems restless as a flood\r\n  Brushed by the winds, so sportive is the light\r\n  Shot through the boughs; it dances as they dance,\r\n  Shadow and sunshine intermingling quick,\r\n  And dark'ning and enlight'ning (as the beams\r\n  Play wanton) every part.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nEverything speaks of the Deity, and the fall of a leaf passes as a\r\nphantom of the dead.\r\n\r\n        ----\"not a tree,\r\n  A plant, a leaf, a blossom, but contains\r\n  A folio volume.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fitful meanings of the wind, in the more boisterous moments of\r\nAEolus, through the branches, speak not louder of God than the whisper\r\nof his breath that plays with the foliage.  The low and broken murmurs\r\nof the water in the gill are as audibly eloquent as the lashing of the\r\nwaves of the ocean in a storm, or the wild roar of the cataract.  The\r\nvoice of nature, come in what form it may, brings unutterable thoughts\r\nof the majesty of the creation.  Whether it is in the deep, delicious\r\ntones of the happiness of the wood-dove, the melting, graceful notes of\r\nthe nightingale, the thrilling melody of other sylvan songsters, or the\r\ntwitterings of the swallow, all compel us to exclaim, \"Oh! there is\r\nharmony in nature.\"\r\n\r\n  \"Sounds inharmonious in themselves, and harsh,\r\n  Yet heard in scenes where peace for ever reigns,\r\n  ... Please highly for their sake.\r\n  ... Kites that swim sublime\r\n  In still-repeated circles, screaming loud,\r\n  ... Have charms for me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Evening]\r\n\r\nBut the hour of stillness, like all other hours, passes away.  The\r\ninsects again give out their sounds; wasps and bees buzz in every\r\ndirection; the talk of birds is clamorously resumed; the king-vulture\r\nand the kite soar high in the hair, like fugle-birds, as signals for\r\nthe resumption of the business of the day.  The chattering manikins\r\nagain rustle among the fig-leaves; the armadillo, and other burrowing\r\nanimals, are seen cautiously peeping from their holes; the horned\r\nscreamer opens wide his throat, and one by one, the whole of the sylvan\r\nfeathered community join in concert.\r\n\r\nThe porcupine moves in the trees; the long grass is observed to give\r\nway as creeping things pursue their prey, or escape from foes; all\r\nindications that the earth and air again are full of animated life.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two elapses, and a gentle breeze rises to cool the air and\r\ngive motion to the trees, as troop after troop of birds and monkeys\r\nwend their way back into the interior of the forest, indicating the\r\ngradual decline of the day.  General preparations are being made for\r\nrest; only the slender deer, the peccari, the timid agouti, and the\r\ntapir, will still graze.  The opossum, and some sly animals of the\r\nfeline race skulk through the obscurity of the wood, stealthily\r\nprowling for prey.  Finally, the last troop of howling monkeys are\r\nheard, as if performing the duty of drovers to those that have preceded\r\nthem; the sloth cries as if in much distress with pain; the croaking of\r\nfrogs, and monotonous chirps of large grasshoppers, bring on the close\r\nof day.\r\n\r\nThe tops of the forest now appear to be on fire, in the midst of which,\r\nthe toucan, on a blasted mora tree, is uttering his evening cry, as\r\ndarker shades are gradually cast into the forest, and the sun's disc\r\nsinks into the horizon.\r\n\r\nThe sky, which a moment since was bright as burnished gold, has already\r\nchanged to a dusky grey, with here and there streaks of purple hue.  A\r\nsolitary bird, truant to its mate, or perhaps a mourner for its loss\r\nduring the day's excursion, is seen like a wayfarer, with tired flight,\r\nwearily labouring to reach the wood ere nightfall.\r\n\r\nTwilight is still lingering in the west, bringing on the night with a\r\nsoft and sweet touch of delicacy, but still approaching, till\r\nsurrounding objects become more and more obscure and confused, though\r\nundiminished in their beauty and effect.  The cries of the macue, the\r\ncapaiera, the goat-sucker, and the bass tones of the bullfrog, are now\r\nheard.  Myriads of luminous beetles fly in the air, resembling the\r\nignes fatui, and announce the departure of the day; when the\r\nnight-moths and numerous other insects start on the wing, the bats flit\r\nbetween the branches of trees, the owls and vampires, like phantoms,\r\nsilently pursue their course in search of prey, reserving their hollow\r\ncries for the ominous hour of midnight.\r\n\r\nThe stars, one after another, are lighted up as the moon rises on the\r\nhorizon, with a modest countenance, to intimate to man that there is\r\nstill a ruling power over the world.  She tinges with silver streaks of\r\nlight the tops and edges of the forest, till\r\n\r\n  \"Lo! midnight, from her starry reign,\r\n  Looks awful down on earth and main,\r\n  The tuneful birds lie hush'd in sleep,\r\n  With all that crop the verdant food,\r\n  With all that skim the crystal flood,\r\n  Or haunt the caverns of the rocky steep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this hour the spectral owl quits the hollow tree, and with his\r\nshriek makes the boldest birds shrink away in fear, though in the\r\nsunshine hour they would hunt him.\r\n\r\n  \"So when the night falls, and dogs do howl,\r\n  Sing Ho! for the reign of the horned owl!\r\n      We know not alway\r\n      Who are kings by day;\r\n  But the king of the night is the bold brown owl!\"\r\n\r\n  \"Mourn not for the owl, nor his gloomy plight!\r\n    The owl hath his share of good;\r\n  If a prisoner he be in the broad daylight,\r\n    He is lord in the dark greenwood.\r\n  Nor lonely the bird, nor his ghastly mate,\r\n    They are each unto each a pride;\r\n  Thrice fonder, perhaps, since a strange dark fate,\r\n    Hath rent them from all beside.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The bow and arrows]\r\n\r\nI made but little progress in archery, which was a great source of\r\nmortification to me, although I spent every leisure hour I could spare\r\nafter obtaining food, in practice.  I was on the verge of despair of\r\never being able to make anything like a shot, when an incident occurred\r\nthat enabled me to kill, in a few weeks, almost any bird on the wing,\r\nif within the range of my bow.  Returning home from a long and\r\nfatiguing ramble (for I had extended my surveys of the forest as I\r\nacquired confidence of finding my way home at night), I one day was\r\nastonished to see a bow and a quiver of arrows suspended from the\r\nbranch of a tree.\r\n\r\nThis was a sight which occasioned feelings that are indescribable.  I\r\nwas both rejoiced and alarmed.  At first I thought my deliverance was\r\ncertain; the next moment I crouched behind a bush to hide myself, as\r\nfrom a most deadly foe.  When I reflected on the loneliness of my\r\nexistence, I longed to join society; yet, whenever society appeared to\r\nbe available, I instinctively shrunk back, as if about to lose my\r\nindependence or be carried into slavery.  Operated on by mingled\r\nimpulses, the dread of man seemed for a long time to prevail.  Might\r\nthey not be savages, and take my life?  Or might they not lead me into\r\ncaptivity, and make a slave of me?  They would at least have the\r\nChristian's practice to urge as a plea, in extenuation of such a\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\nConfident that human beings were in the neighbourhood, I at length\r\nresolved to secrete myself in a bush and wait their return.  I fixed my\r\neyes on the bow and quiver, expecting their owner would return for\r\nthem; but the tones of the toucan were heard, by which I was as well\r\ninformed of the approach of evening, as the partridge's call announces\r\nthe coming day.  Still unwilling to quit the spot, I remained\r\nthroughout the night; but no owner came to claim the weapons.  All this\r\ntime I feared to touch them as if they were a trap laid to ensnare me.\r\nAbout noon the next day, I thought of possessing myself of them, and\r\nthen made a circuit to reassure myself that no one was at hand.  With\r\nfear and trembling I then, like a thief, took the bow and quiver from\r\nthe tree, and hastened back to my hut to examine them.  The whole\r\nsecret of my inability to shoot birds was now at once explained.  I had\r\nnot feathered my arrows, nor was my bow long enough.\r\n\r\nStill anxious to know their owner, the following morning I repaired\r\nagain to the spot, and hung my own rudely formed weapons on the same\r\ntree from which I had taken the others.  My motives were, first, to\r\nascertain whether any person would yet come to remove them, and also to\r\ninform those who might come for that purpose, that another human being\r\nwas in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nThe bow and arrows hung there a month, when I gave up all hopes of\r\nseeing any person in the woods; still the event caused me much\r\nuneasiness, and ever afterwards occasioned me to tread the paths around\r\nwith extreme caution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Flint and steel]\r\n\r\nBeing now furnished with well-made arms, I soon brought down my birds,\r\nand might have fared sumptuously, could I have procured a fire.  All my\r\nwaking hours were, therefore, spent in bewailing this want, when one\r\nmorning, as I was digging with my stick to come at a land tortoise that\r\nhad crept into a hole, I raked out a piece of flint, and the tinder-box\r\noccurring to my mind, I struck it on the back of my knife, and\r\ninstantly produced sparks, which actually made me leap for joy.  My\r\ndelight, however, was but of short duration.  How were the sparks to be\r\ncollected?  I had no tinder--no matches.  I then thought of my shirt,\r\nwhich I had long cast off; but then I had no matches, and must have\r\nfire before I could make tinder.\r\n\r\nMy joy was soon turned into despondency.  I threw down the flint, and\r\nin the bitterness of my disappointment, apostrophised it, as the cock\r\nin the fable did, when scratching on a dunghill he found a jewel\r\ninstead of a grain of corn.  \"Are all my days to be spent,\" I\r\nejaculated, \"in hopes that delight me only to make me more miserable?\"\r\nSuddenly it occurred to my memory, that when at school, our small\r\npieces of artillery were fired with lighted decayed wood, what the boys\r\ncalled touch-wood.  Repossessing myself of the flint, I flew to my old\r\nsleeping-place, and in my impatience, struck a light on my former\r\nbed--the soft wood in the interior--it ignited, and smouldered.  I was\r\nin an ecstacy of delight, and clapped my hands with exultation.  Still\r\nI had no flame.  I then collected some dried leaves, and holding them\r\nloosely over the spot that was alight, I blew with my mouth; a severely\r\nburnt hand soon informed me that I had succeeded.\r\n\r\nMy first fire was indeed a bonfire: heaping more leaves and dried\r\nsticks on to it, the tree was entirely consumed, and a number of others\r\nso damaged as very soon to become touch-wood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The thunder-storm]\r\n\r\nA terrible thunder-storm succeeded this exploit.  So wholly absorbed\r\nhad I been with the fire, that when it expended itself, I found myself\r\nin total darkness, the moon having been suddenly obscured.  All the\r\ninhabitants of the wood were restless and uneasy in their beds.  I\r\ncould hear the stag startle, and again lay himself down.  Flashes of\r\nlightning showed the birds, lifting their heads at intervals, then\r\nreturning them hastily again under their wings.  The storm had for some\r\ntime been gathering on the tops of the forest, and had now spread its\r\nblack mantle over the moon, while I, like a school-boy on the fifth of\r\nNovember, had been exulting over a blaze.\r\n\r\nOn the storm advanced, in the majesty of darkness, moving on the wings\r\nof the blast, which my imagination pictured as uprooting the trees\r\naround me.  The thunder rolled over the crown of the forest in the rear\r\nof the lightning.  Rifted clouds continued to pass over my head.  An\r\nowl left its dirge unfinished, and fitted its ruffled feathers into a\r\ncleft of a blasted tree over my head.  The wild animals that prowl by\r\nnight, with famished stomachs, sought shelter in their dens.\r\n\r\nI alone stood bared to the fury of the storm, incapable of reaching my\r\nhut in the darkness of that awful night.  The thunder rolled as with\r\nten thousand voices, and the lightning at intervals set the whole\r\nforest in a blaze of light.  One of the flashes brought down a mora\r\ntree near to where I stood, crushing the limbs of other trees as it\r\nfell.  The crash was terrific.  Examining it the next morning by\r\ndaylight, there was a wild fig-tree growing out of its top, and on the\r\nfig grew a wild species of vine.  The fig-tree was as large as a common\r\napple-tree, yet owed its growth to an undigested seed, dropped by birds\r\nthat resort to the mora to feed on its ripe fruit.  Such seeds the sap\r\nof the mora raises into full bearing, when they, in their turn, are\r\ncalled on to support and give out their sap to different species of\r\nseeds, also dropped by birds.  In this case the usurpation of the fig\r\non the mora, and the vine on the fig, brought all to an early end.  A\r\ndead sloth was lying near to the prostrate timber, probably brought\r\ndown, by the force of its fall, from the branch of another tree.\r\n\r\nIt was a night of devastation in the wilds of nature.  The storms of\r\ndestruction blew piercingly on every quarter.  The destroying blast\r\nclapped his wings over many a tree, and laid prostrate numerous\r\ncreatures that had life as the sun went down the previous evening.  To\r\nthe things that can be shaken, belong all that is earthly.  However\r\ndurable they may appear, however they may glitter, or stable they may\r\nappear, age, or the storm, will bring them to oblivion.  Mutability is\r\nwritten on all the works of nature.  It is an inscription that meets\r\nevery eye, whether turned on the foundations of a city, a nation, or\r\nthe works of the creation.  Awe-struck with the dilapidations the\r\nmorning made visible, I hastened to my hut, anxious to see if all was\r\nsafe there, and prepare to cook myself a dinner.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The sloth]\r\n\r\nMan is essentially a cooking animal, and though omnivorous in his\r\nappetite, is nine parts out of ten carnivorous.  I had abundance of\r\nvegetable food around me, of which I ate freely, and was in good\r\nhealth; yet my desire to taste animal food was so strong that I would\r\nat the time have made almost any sacrifice to obtain it.  I had reached\r\nmore than half the distance towards my residence, thinking all the way\r\nonly on the means that I possessed of making a fire, before it occurred\r\nto me that I had no flesh to cook.  I then turned back, and with my\r\nknife cut off the hind-quarter of the sloth, being resolved to try the\r\nquality of the flesh.\r\n\r\nHaving collected a small heap of the dried rotten wood, to use as\r\ntinder, I succeeded in making a fire outside my hut, where I broiled\r\nsome pieces of the sloth's flesh, and from it made a tolerable meal,\r\nthough it was not so good as beef or mutton.\r\n\r\nWhenever I subsequently met with the sloth, he always excited my pity,\r\nand I forbore from doing such a helpless creature any injury.  The\r\nnatives say that by his piteous moans he will make the heart of a tiger\r\nrelent, and turn away from him.  The sloth is a solitary animal; he has\r\nno companion to cheer him, but lies on the branches of trees almost\r\nstationary, having no means of defence or escape, if you intend him any\r\nharm; his looks, his gestures, and his cries declare it; therefore do\r\nnot kill him.  He subsists wholly on the leaves of trees, and does not\r\nquit one branch till there is nothing left for him to eat, and he then\r\nmoves evidently with much pain to himself.  He preys on no living\r\nanimal, and is deficient and deformed, when compared with other\r\nanimals, though in some other respects he is compensated in the\r\ncomposition of his frame.  His feet are without soles, nor can he move\r\nhis toes separately; he therefore cannot walk, but hooks himself along\r\nby means of the claws which are at the extremity of the fore-feet.  He\r\nhas no cutting teeth; he has four stomachs, and yet wants the long\r\nintestinal canals of ruminating animals.  His hair lies flat on his\r\nbody, like long grass withered by the frost.  He has six more ribs than\r\nthe elephant, namely, forty-six, the latter having only forty; his legs\r\nstrike the eye as being too short, and as if joined to the body with\r\nthe loss of a joint.  On the whole, as a quadruped, the sloth is of the\r\nlowest degree.  He never quits a tree until all the leaves are eaten.\r\n\r\nThe day after I had made a meal from the sloth, I shot my arrow through\r\nthe head of a horned screamer, which brought him within my grasp; this\r\nwas a great feat for me to accomplish, the screamer being a majestic\r\nbird, as large as a turkey-cock, having on the head a long slender\r\nhorn, each wing being armed with a sharp, strong spur, of an inch long.\r\nI had seated myself behind a tree, where I had been, for several hours,\r\nwatching the movements of the ants that build their nests on those\r\ntrees, when the bird came within a few yards of me.  This incident\r\npractically exemplified to me that, like other animals that seek for\r\nprey, I must use patience, and be wary in my movements.  It taught me\r\nto reflect and to know that it was not rambling over much space that\r\nwould ensure success, and that every spot in the world was available,\r\neither for the study of the things of creation or for procuring food.\r\n\r\nIt is a great error some fall into when they imagine that travelling\r\nover much ground will give knowledge; those who observe and reflect may\r\ngain more information when examining a puddle of water, than the\r\ncareless will in traversing the globe.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The ants]\r\n\r\nOf the insect tribe, the ants early attracted my attention, and I spent\r\nmuch time in watching their movements; indeed, from the first hour I\r\nturned my thoughts to the study of insects, I never afterwards spent a\r\ndull one.  The tree ants' nests are about five times as large as those\r\nmade by rooks, from which they have covered ways to the ground; these\r\nways I frequently broke down, but as often as I did so, they were\r\nquickly under repair, a body of labouring ants being immediately\r\nsummoned for that purpose.  Ants have the means of communicating with\r\neach other in a very rapid manner.  I am of opinion that the antennae\r\nare the medium through which they receive and convey orders to each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nI have seen a troop of ants a mile long, each one carrying in its mouth\r\na round leaf about the size of a sixpence, which appeared to have been\r\ntrimmed round to the shape.  Wasps do the same; and after twisting them\r\nup in the shape of a horn, deposit their eggs in them.  When on their\r\nmarch, or engaged at work, nothing deters them from progressing; they\r\nseem to have no fear either of injury or death.  I have broken their\r\nline at different points, and killed thousands of them; the others go\r\nover the same ground, as if perfectly unconscious of danger, while a\r\nbody of them are instantly detached to remove the dead, and clear the\r\nway.  It matters not how often the experiment is repeated, or what\r\nnumber are slain, others come on as if their forces were unlimited.  It\r\nwould seem that they live under an absolute monarchy, and dare not\r\ndisobey orders.  When accompanying them on a march, I have seen a\r\nmessenger arrive from the opposite direction to that they were going,\r\nand the whole line, as I have said, of sometimes a mile long,\r\nsimultaneously brought to a halt.  One of the ants belonging to the\r\nbody went forward, and applied its antennae to those of the messenger,\r\nafter which, the latter returned the way he came, and the main body\r\nimmediately altered its course of march.\r\n\r\nAt one time, I fell in with an unusually large body of these\r\npersevering labourers, and being resolved, if possible, to stop them, I\r\nformed a ditch in their way, and filled it with water; while the ditch\r\nwas being made, they continued their course up and down the ridges of\r\nthe loose earth, as if nothing had happened, although hundreds were\r\nevery instant buried.  When, however, the water was turned into the\r\nchannel, there was a momentary halt; but as the ant must never be idle,\r\nit was but for an instant, to receive orders to take the margin of the\r\nearth, and travel round the head of the channel.  How the nature of the\r\ndisaster they had met with was made known, so as to stop the whole body\r\nsimultaneously, may be difficult to ascertain; but at the moment of\r\nmaking these experiments I have distinctly seen the antennae of one ant\r\nstrike the tail of the one immediately before it, and the same movement\r\nrepeated by all the others in rapid succession as far as my observation\r\nextended.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Wasps]\r\n\r\nAll insects that live in communities are, I should imagine, in\r\npossession of language.  One day I saw a wasp fly into my hut, and\r\nrecollecting that I had a small collection of honey wrapped in some\r\nplantain leaves, I went to close the shutter as it again flew out; but\r\nobserving the wasp immediately fly towards another of his species, and\r\nthen to a second and a third, and those instantly fly off in opposite\r\ndirections, I said to myself, the discovery of my depot of honey is\r\nbeing advertised throughout the community of wasps.  Thinking I would\r\ndisappoint the depredators, before I left home I was very careful in\r\nfastening the entrance, and stuffing every crevice up with long grass.\r\nAbout a hundred yards from my hut I met a swarm of wasps, which induced\r\nme to return and ascertain whether my conjectures were confirmed; and\r\nthere I found an immense number seeking an entrance, evidently with a\r\nview of plundering me of my honey.  It was not long ere they found\r\nadmission through some of the apertures in the roof.  Knowing that my\r\nhoney must go,--for a swarm of wasps is not to be molested with\r\nimpunity,--I turned away to pursue my walk with the reflection that\r\nthey only took what they could get, and suited their appetites, the\r\nbusiness of my own every-day life.\r\n\r\nBoth in society and in the forest it is wise at all times to avoid\r\nbeing an aggressor.  The stings of mankind, and of insects, are most\r\nfrequently the result of our own imprudence.  In the forest I have\r\ndaily been surrounded with myriads of wasps and large stinging bees,\r\nand never received an injury but when I was committing depredations on\r\ntheir store.\r\n\r\nBut of all plunderers in nature, the ant exceeds the whole.  I had\r\nbecome acquainted with five species of bees in my immediate\r\nneighbourhood, not one of which could secure their combs from the\r\nvoracious appetites of the ant.  They came in such numbers, as\r\nsometimes, in my view, to threaten the undermining of the forest; and\r\nwere to be seen of all sizes and colour.  One sort is so large, that\r\nthe natives make a considerable article of food of them when fried.\r\n\r\nThe termites, or white ants, are very destructive; neither fruit,\r\nflowers of plants, or food of any kind, escapes them.  When they appear\r\nin the dwellings of man, they will undermine a house in a few hours, if\r\nthe wood of which it is built suits their taste.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Voracity of the ants]\r\n\r\nThe whole of the ant tribes are, however, essentially carnivorous, and\r\nare useful in repressing a too rapid increase amongst reptiles much\r\nlarger than themselves; and I have often thought, when watching their\r\nmovements, and observing that there is nothing, from the smallest\r\nwinged insect to the carcase of a bullock, that comes to the ground,\r\nbut they instantly assemble in millions to devour it, that they were\r\nintended by nature to prevent the corruption of the air from the decay\r\nand putrefaction of animal matter.  If an enormous spider accidentally\r\nfalls to the ground, they give it no time to recover itself; thousands\r\nare instantly on it; and although the spider, in its struggles to\r\nescape, will kill and crush numbers, still others continue to crawl up\r\nhis legs and thighs, and there hang on in quietness, till their victim\r\nis exhausted by fatigue, when a few seconds serve to remove all traces\r\nof its heretofore existence.  As I grew older, and acquired more\r\nexperience in hunting for my food, I frequently killed large animals,\r\nof whose flesh I could only eat as much as served me for a meal, before\r\nthe remainder would be spoiled by the heat of the weather: this the\r\nants generally cleared away.\r\n\r\nAt length I learned to go out by moonlight, to kill deer and the\r\npeccari,--a time that they like to browse, and may be approached with\r\nmore ease.  I generally dragged the remains of a carcase I did not want\r\nin the way of the ants, and watched them at their feast.  A few hours\r\nserved to leave the bones of the largest animal perfectly clean, and as\r\na skeleton for study, fit for an exhibition.\r\n\r\nWhen the termites, or white ant, is seen in the neighbourhood of man,\r\nthe antipathies of the species are rendered available.  As soon as they\r\nare observed, sugar is strewed in such a direction as to lead the brown\r\nor black ants to the spot, who, it is known, will immediately attack\r\nand put the white party to the rout, much to the amusement of the\r\nnegroes, who cheer on the blacks to kill the whites.  I have often\r\nawoke with my body covered with ants, when I generally ran to the\r\nnearest water, and plunging into it, freed myself from them; though I\r\nnever could discover for what purpose they spread themselves over my\r\nframe, unless it were in expectation of my becoming a corpse.  When,\r\nhowever, I did rouse myself, they seldom exhibited much alacrity in\r\nacknowledging their error by making a speedy retreat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nAN ADVENTURE WITH A BEAR--AN EXTRAORDINARY ECHO--I AM ATTACKED WITH A\r\nFEVER, AND SUBSEQUENTLY DRIVEN FROM MY HUT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Give me, indulgent gods--with mind serene,\r\n  And guiltless heart--to range the sylvan scene;\r\n  No splendid poverty, no smiling care,\r\n  No well-bred hate, or servile grandeur there.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI had now become a sportsman--a Nimrod--my chief delight being found in\r\nthe use of my bow and arrows.  Thus armed, I ranged the forest, or laid\r\nin covert, to destroy any game which might come in my way.  My\r\npropensity for killing, however, soon led me into a scrape, the escape\r\nfrom which nearly cost me my life; yet the lesson was thrown away on\r\nme, for it in no way abated my desire to shoot and eat the flesh of\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\nEarly one morning I had taken my station behind a large tree, from\r\nwhich I discharged an arrow at a mocking-bird.  No sooner had the arrow\r\nquitted the string, than I descried a bear, feeding on ants' nests, and\r\nthat in a direct line between myself and the bird shot at.  The arrow\r\npassed close by his ear; it might have struck him: be this as it may,\r\nthe bear instantly began to descend the tree, showing evident signs of\r\nhis intention to revenge the insult.\r\n\r\nNot being disposed to confront such an enemy in an angry mood, I\r\ninstantly took to my heels; but had not proceeded far, before the\r\nshaggy monster was near overtaking me.  In this extremity I ascended a\r\ntree, confident of being as good a climber as Bruin was.  I had,\r\nhowever, scarcely reached the lowest extending branch, before the\r\nenraged beast was close on me.  Fortunately, I had in my flight\r\nretained possession of my stick; and as the bear had no means of\r\nsupporting himself but by clinging to the trunk of the tree with his\r\nclaws, I applied my staff with so much vigour to his feet, that he was\r\nconstrained to drop to the ground, whereupon his rage was great.  He\r\nthen took a turn or two round the base of the tree to cool himself,\r\ngave a growl, and seated himself under it, fixing his eyes on me.  In\r\nthis position the disappointed monster remained, on his hind-quarters,\r\nseven hours, watching my movements; till at length, growing weary of\r\nhis presence, and having read somewhere of the effect of the human\r\nvoice, I cried out loudly, mentioning several names, as if calling for\r\nassistance.  When speaking of the storm, I said that the thunder rolled\r\nwith ten thousand voices.  The cause, however, of its multiplied tones,\r\nwas reserved for this adventure to make known.  As I called out, I was\r\nutterly astonished to hear my own words repeated several times in\r\nsuccession;--the bear started on his feet; and after looking round, as\r\nif in fear of an attack, took himself off at his utmost speed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An alarming echo]\r\n\r\nAssured that I had heard human voices, I became more agitated than when\r\nin company with the bear.  It may appear anomalous; it is nevertheless\r\ntrue, that the prospect, or thought, of meeting with human beings in\r\nthese wilds, always elicited agitation, or, more properly, terror.\r\n\r\nThe joy that hope brought of my emancipation was always mixed with an\r\nalloy of indefinable dread of some coming evil.  I remained in the tree\r\nabout an hour after the bear had departed, continuing to amuse myself\r\nwith the exercise of the voice, and listening to the repetitions of its\r\nsounds.  At length, when assured that the bear did not contemplate a\r\nrenewal of the attack, I descended from the tree, and again raised my\r\nvoice, and was again surprised to find that I had no response.  This\r\nstruck me as very mysterious; and instead of seeking for natural causes\r\nof the phenomena, I abandoned myself to superstitious fears, and\r\npersuaded myself that I was on enchanted ground, while my mind indulged\r\nin endless chimeras.  Every effect is preceded by a cause, was a\r\nsentence I had often heard my father repeat; and as it recurred to my\r\nmemory, I again ascended the tree, and repeated the experiments,\r\nalternately, for some time, on the ground and in the tree.  The result\r\nwas always the same, the voice being reverberated when in the tree, and\r\nnot so when on the ground.  Again and again.  I turned the matter over\r\nin the mind, and could come to no other conclusion than that there were\r\npersons somewhere in the neighbourhood, who could hear me from the\r\ntree, but were too far off to hear my voice when surrounded with the\r\nunderwood on the ground.  I now thought it my duty to find out the\r\npersons from whom I supposed the sounds came, and was actually\r\npreparing to start in search of them, when it suddenly flashed on my\r\nmind that I had heard a similar phenomenon under a bridge near my own\r\nnative village, which the boys called an echo; yet as that gave only\r\none response, or echo, I was still perplexed to make out a cause for\r\nhearing so many.  This phenomenon, however, soon became a considerable\r\nsource of amusement to me, and by shifting my positions I found several\r\nseries of echoes: in some places the reverberations were six and\r\nsevenfold, and in others they were so numerous as to run into\r\nindistinctness.  For a considerable time subsequently it was my wont,\r\non a Sunday, to ascend a tree after my devotions, and sing a line or\r\ntwo, or a verse of a psalm which I knew, when the effect was something\r\nlike a number of voices in a place of worship, though the ear could not\r\ncompass the innumerable combination of reverberations.  When the echo\r\nwas peculiarly distinct and near, and then taken up and repeated at a\r\ndistance, it conveyed to my imagination the idea of aerial spirits\r\nanswering each other.  It was thus that the astonishing multiplied\r\nreverberations of the thunder in this region were accounted\r\nfor--namely, the transmission of its sound from point to point.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The honey-bear]\r\n\r\nI saw no more of the ant-bear; but the honey-bear, which was more\r\ncommon, and a fellow-depredator of the bees' nests with myself, often\r\ncrossed my path; and it required the exercise of much ingenuity and\r\ncaution to successfully compete with him.\r\n\r\nIn all countries where the collection of honey is made a profit,\r\nvarious devices have been resorted to for deterring or entrapping the\r\nrugged depredators.  To enumerate them all would be a digression from\r\nmy narrative.  The following are, however, among other successful modes\r\nof dealing with bears who have a taste for honey.\r\n\r\nThe trees in which the bees are found the inhabitants lop close to the\r\ntrunk, up to the home of the bees, so that the bear has nothing but the\r\nmain trunk to assist him in climbing.  These trees they sometimes stick\r\nwith spikes, and blades of knives, with the points upwards.  These,\r\nhowever, offer but small impediments to the bear in ascending the tree,\r\nbut as he cannot descend with his head foremost, he is compelled to\r\nslide down, when the points are not so easily avoided, generally\r\nlacerating him in such a manner as to deter him from making any future\r\nattempt to rob hives situated in trees.\r\n\r\nThe experienced bear will, however, sometimes, as he ascends the tree,\r\nbreak off the points, and secure himself a safe retreat.  Entrapping\r\nthem is, therefore, a more successful practice.\r\n\r\nIn lopping the tree the peasants are careful to leave a branch that\r\nextends out from the trunk above the hole where the bees have\r\nconstructed their hive.  From such a branch they suspend, with four\r\nropes, a flat board, forming one scale of a pair, such as are commonly\r\nused in open markets; when this is hung up it hangs pendant at a\r\ndistance from the trunk of the tree.  When, however, it is prepared as\r\na trap, it is brought close to the body of the tree by means of a bark\r\nrope, upon which it is fastened over the entrance of the hive.\r\n\r\nThe bear having climbed the tree, with difficulty maintains himself\r\nwith his claws while he commits the depredation, and is, therefore,\r\nglad to find a seat so conveniently placed for him to sit on; but\r\nseeing the entrance of the hole nearly covered with the bark-rope, he\r\nimmediately commences tearing it away, and, in so doing, liberates\r\nhimself from the tree, and becomes suspended in the air.  In this\r\nsituation he sits contemplating the alternatives of remaining to be\r\nkilled when discovered, or venturing a leap to the ground; both,\r\nhowever, lead to the same end, as stakes are placed to receive him on\r\ntheir points, should he hazard a leap.\r\n\r\nIn cold countries, it is by no means uncommon for bears to attack human\r\nbeings; but in forests, within the tropics, where redundant nature\r\npours out her horn of plenty, and food is found in abundance throughout\r\nthe year, man, if he is not himself quarrelsomely disposed, may pass\r\nwithout molestation.  Both the ant and the honey-hear occasionally\r\nvisited my hut, having frequently detected them sniffing round my\r\nbarricade; but when I made my appearance, either on the roof, or in\r\nreturning from a ramble, they always walked away without manifesting\r\ndecided hostile intentions.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The rains of Guiana]\r\n\r\nI had now passed ten months in the forest, and had learned to dispense\r\nwith shoes, stockings, linen, and, indeed, with every kind of covering\r\nfor the body, excepting a wrapper for the loins, which I contrived to\r\nmake out of the remaining rags collected from the worn-out habiliments\r\nI possessed when lost to my family.  I had also combated with a wet\r\nseason, and this season was now again approaching, that is, January and\r\nFebruary, when the rains fall heavily; indeed, rain is no proper term\r\nfor a fall of water in a Guiana forest.  Rain conveys the idea of water\r\nfalling in drops; there, the water comes bodily upon the earth in wide\r\nsheets.  And before they come, no notice is given; they send no _avant\r\ncourier_ of a few scattered drops to warn you of what is to follow;\r\nthey are their own messengers.  In the intervals between every such\r\nfall, the fervid sun resumes its influence, operating with such\r\nintensity as to effectually envelope all things in hot steam.  A\r\ncontinuation of rain and excessive heat produces exuberant vegetation;\r\nand these in turn, by the exhalations of its ripeness and corruption,\r\nfurnish back to the atmosphere an accumulating fund of distempering\r\nmiasma, or cause of malignant fever.\r\n\r\nWhen the destructive effects of these influences are considered, in a\r\nlocality amongst the rankest productions of nature, and where in a\r\nthousand places the water is pent up and sluggish,--prolific producers\r\nof reptiles and noisome vapours--nothing but a miracle, through the\r\ninterposition of Providence, could have preserved me in health so long.\r\nBut my day of sickness was not to be altogether remitted, it was only\r\npostponed, and then inflicted in kindness, to teach me prudence, and\r\nthe necessity there was for adopting proper precautions against evil\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nMy hut, notwithstanding the complacency with which I had selected the\r\nsite, was, after all, situated in the very worst place I could have\r\nfound in the entire forest.  The former rainy season had inundated the\r\nmorass that lay in the rear of my dwelling, and had, indeed, threatened\r\nme with submersion; yet I continued to remain there, as if nothing of\r\ndanger had occurred, and the air, impregnated with the fermentations of\r\ncollected vegetation for ages, was as healthful as that on hilly lands.\r\nIt is the province of experience to calculate or anticipate results;\r\nhow then could one so young as I was know that too frequently the\r\nbeauty which redundant nature presents to the eye, is but an indication\r\nof its treachery to the constitution.\r\n\r\nI had not then reflected on the condition on which mortals receive\r\nlife, namely, that of being associated with an inseparable companion\r\ncalled care; a companion which never quits their side till they resign\r\nup their souls.\r\n\r\nIn my isolated situation, it was natural I should seek to indulge the\r\nsentiment of friendship with such companions as the locality afforded.\r\nThe interior of my hut was therefore a kind of aviary; and it was my\r\npractice every morning to devote a couple of hours to teaching, and in\r\nthe amusement of feeding my companions; after which, I indulged, by\r\nturns, the most docile with a walk into the interior of the wooded\r\nparts of the forest.  A land-tortoise had become so tame, that when, in\r\nmy rambles, I sat down to rest, I allowed him to seek his own food in\r\nthe immediate neighbourhood, and that without any fear of his wandering\r\nfar, even if unwatched.\r\n\r\nThe rainy season had commenced about three weeks, when one morning I\r\narose with an intense headache, excessive thirst, and a burning skin.\r\nI hastened to the stream, drank copiously of cold water, bathed for\r\nupwards of an hour, and then returned with my usual supply of water,\r\nconveyed in a clay vessel, which I had baked in the sun.  This, as were\r\nsimilar vessels, was chiefly for the use of my family of birds, &c.\r\n\r\nI remember perfectly well, the following morning, that, as was my\r\ncustom, I caressed the whole family; and, to avoid jealous bickerings,\r\nto which some were prone, I bestowed on each an equal portion of\r\nattention; and that subsequently I took up a tortoise and a\r\nmocking-bird for my companions during a walk.  I also remember, that as\r\nI reached the aperture under the roof, the rays of the sun affected my\r\nsight in a peculiar manner, and that a giddy sensation came over me;\r\nbut from that moment I lost all remembrance of what followed, being\r\nunconscious of passing circumstances; until I found myself reduced in\r\nflesh, and so weak and feeble, as to be incapable of rising from the\r\nfloor of the hut where I was lying.  Under the opening, from whence I\r\nmust have fallen, lay a dead tortoise, the shell being crushed.  The\r\nsticks of which my aviary was composed were all torn asunder, and the\r\nbroken fragments strewed about the place.  Several of my favourite\r\nbirds, with their necks wrung, were on the ground; the others were\r\nabsent.  The vessel in which I had brought the water was broken into\r\npieces, and many parts of the hut exhibited proofs of an attempt having\r\nbeen made to pull up the stakes of which it was formed.  These were all\r\nevidences that I had fallen down when attempting to leave the hut,\r\nprobably from giddiness or vertigo; that a violent fever had\r\nsupervened, and in that condition I had lost my reason, and the\r\nconsequent command of my actions--whence the devastation around me, and\r\nthe debilitated state in which I found the body when reason returned.\r\nSoon after consciousness had made me sensible of my condition, I fell\r\nasleep, in which I was carried into all kinds of illusory imaginations.\r\nAmong other fantasies, I dreamed that I was on the sea--walking--yet\r\nbounded on either side with rows of myrtles in full blossom, intermixed\r\nwith jessamines; and that thousands of Cupids and Fauns preceded me,\r\nstrewing flowers in my way.  These figures, carrying baskets, were\r\nfollowed by Zephyrs, which supplied the flowers.  I was in a state of\r\nenchantment with the scene, yet every moment suffered from the dread of\r\nsinking into the depths of the sea, until I thought the water would no\r\nlonger support me, when I awoke in the fright of being drowned.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The power of prayer]\r\n\r\nThe fever had entirely left me, and I was in a measure refreshed by the\r\nsleep I had had.  I was now reflecting on the phenomena of dreams, and\r\nthe length of time the impressions they leave remain on the mind--for I\r\nstill heard the action of the water--when, after several efforts to\r\ndisengage myself from the illusion, as I thought, I was roused from\r\nimaginings to a sense of the reality of what I heard.  Plash, plash,\r\nwent the water against the exterior of my hut; and these sounds were\r\ncontinuous and audible, so much so as to be unmistakable.  Still I was\r\nincapable of reaching the exterior to see what was the cause.  My state\r\nof alarm and agitation may therefore be better conceived than\r\ndescribed.  Too feeble to use my limbs, I had no resource but in\r\nprayer.  Most sincerely did I offer the Supreme Being thanks for having\r\npreserved me through my illness.  I then prayed, that after such a\r\nmiraculous dispensation of Divine goodness, I might not be left to\r\nperish in my helplessness.  I believe that no one ever prayed from the\r\nheart without acquiring some additional knowledge or strength of\r\npurpose.  May not this be because prayer is both an inquiry of the\r\nintellect and of the affections; the one seeking for the truth, and the\r\nother for what is good?  Besides, pure devotion is thought, which\r\nimproves, at least, and helps the judgment.\r\n\r\nAfter some time spent in this manner, I felt the perturbation of my\r\nmind much abated, and in a frame to contemplate steadily surrounding\r\ncircumstances, and consider how they might be best dealt with.  A short\r\ntime since, and I had looked on death as inevitable, either by drowning\r\nor starvation; now, I reflected, that if the water had been very high,\r\nit must have, ere this, penetrated my frail creation; and, if very\r\npowerful, it would have swept the whole away without giving me any\r\nnotice whatever.  It also occurred to me that I ought to have some\r\ndozen or two of cocoa-nuts and a store of honey within my reach, as I\r\nlay on the floor.\r\n\r\nAs I had not previously, on any occasion, made a store, I could not but\r\nsee the hand of Providence directing me to prepare for my present\r\nextremity.  These supplies were placed in a hole which I had made in\r\nthe ground for their reception, being covered with a piece of bark, and\r\na stone to keep it in its place.  Fortunately, I had only to drag\r\nmyself a few yards, and take the nourishment I so much needed; although\r\nit was not calves'-foot jelly and port wine, yet, in my then weak\r\nstate, it proved a very gratifying refreshment.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible for me to make any rational estimate of the length\r\nof time I was under the influence of the fever, or of the period\r\nemployed in sleeping during my recovery.  It is probable that it had\r\nbut a short, though a violent career; but the present exigencies were\r\ntoo pressing to admit of much time being expended over the past.\r\nPlash, plash, continued the water against the hut, and the floor began\r\nto exhibit signs of its entrance into the interior.  My situation was\r\nnow one of real peril.  I made an effort to raise myself up to the\r\nopening through which I mast pass to escape, but as I had first to\r\nmount a stool formed of pieces of bark, and then to raise my body\r\nseveral feet with my arms, before my head could reach the aperture, I\r\nfound my strength insufficient for the task.  My distress was\r\nconsiderably augmented by the impossibility of my taking any more rest\r\nin a reclining position, as the water was rapidly covering the floor,\r\nand the probability there was of the structure giving way on a sudden,\r\nand submerging me in an instant of time.  I seated myself on the\r\nbefore-mentioned stool, with my feet and legs stretched over a\r\nbird-coop that had not been entirely broken up.\r\n\r\nSingular to relate, in this position I fell into a profound sleep, with\r\nmy back against the lining of the hut; the extreme of distress,\r\ncontemplated for a length of time, I believe has a tendency to produce\r\nthis effect.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Perils of water]\r\n\r\nI had fallen asleep as the moon went down, about an hour after\r\nmidnight; it was daylight when I awoke; the first object that caught my\r\nattention being the staff, on which were the notches that formed my\r\ncalendar; this was floating on the water, now a foot or more in depth.\r\nIt is said drowning men catch at straws; the idea immediately came\r\nacross my mind that, with the support of the stick, I should be enabled\r\nto effect my escape.  I succeeded; and after wading about fifty yards\r\nup to my knees in water, reached a dry spot of land, on which my first\r\nact was to kneel, and offer up prayers of gratitude for my deliverance.\r\nAs a period of unconsciousness had occasioned a breach in my calendar,\r\nand the true Sabbath was lost to me, I made the day of my deliverance a\r\nSunday, from which hereafter to reckon the days of the week.\r\n\r\nAttenuated in frame, with weak limbs, but possessing a healthy stomach,\r\nI dragged myself to a half-natural cave, at a short distance, which I\r\nhad previously cleared out as a place where I might find shelter from\r\nthe heavy rains, and where I could lie in wait to kill a head of game\r\nwithout the fatigue of hunting for it.  In this retreat I lived for two\r\ndays, solely on cocoa-nuts and honey; the third, I caught an armadillo,\r\nwhich I dressed for dinner, and then resumed the practice of taking a\r\ndessert in the afternoon, having abundance of fruit at my command.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the miseries inseparable from the condition of man, that\r\ngood and evil are presented under different forms; misery often\r\nappearing to us under the mask of happiness, and prosperity under the\r\nimage of misfortune, teaching us to leave all in the hands of Him who\r\nknows best what is good for his creatures.\r\n\r\nI had no reason to complain, having within my reach blossoms, green and\r\nripe fruit, all on the same trees, and those in abundance throughout\r\nthe year, new soil for their growth being constantly formed by the\r\nexuviae of the forest, which here keeps her sabbath in silence.  But\r\neven here, in the midst of plenty, man must not be idle.  \"The crab,\"\r\nsay the negroes, \"that does not leave his hole, never gets fat.\"  As my\r\nstrength returned, my wants increased; and as animal food appeared to\r\nbe needed for the renovation of the frame, I was constantly engaged in\r\nthe pursuit of it; while, what leisure time I possessed became irksome,\r\nfrom the want of a domestic establishment such as I had formed in the\r\nhut.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The first night in the cave]\r\n\r\nAlthough my specimen of sylvan architecture was at no time more than\r\nhalf submerged in water, and that without being broken up, I abandoned\r\nit as being unsafe as a residence.  Finding myself not only more secure\r\nfrom the heavy rains, but much more cool in the cave, I now began to\r\nfortify its entrance, to guard against night intrusions.  In effecting\r\nthis object, the only one I kept in view while at work, I fell into the\r\nerror of neglecting to provide for the admission of sufficient air to\r\nsustain life.  The first night I passed in the cave, after completing\r\nmy barricade of bark, which served the purpose of planks of deal, I\r\ncould get no rest, turning and rolling about with an uneasiness I could\r\nin no way account for, till the morning came, when the admission of air\r\nmade me sensible of breathing with more freedom, and at once explained\r\nthe cause of my previous uneasiness.  The next day was spent in cutting\r\nholes through the bark fence, to remedy so serious an evil as the want\r\nof air.\r\n\r\nAccustomed as I had been to the intimate society of birds and other\r\nanimals, their loss was too severely felt for me to remain long without\r\nthem; I therefore commenced the construction of a new aviary on the\r\noutside of the cave, with a space beneath, to confine any of the small\r\nkind of animals which might fall into my hands.  One surviving tortoise\r\nfrom the hut I had already brought into the cave.  It was not long\r\nbefore the entrance to my retreat somewhat resembled the display made\r\nby a metropolitan dealer in animals, on the pavement before the steps\r\nwhich lead to his lodgings in the cellar.  Contentment is in no station\r\nthe lot of mankind.  Although my new residence had many advantages,\r\nnothing could compensate me for the loss of the security in which I had\r\nevery morning obtained a survey of the movements of the inhabitants of\r\nthe forest from the roof of the hut.  I did not, however, indulge in\r\nidle regrets, continuing to work on in constructing snares and traps,\r\nto people my new dwelling-place; and when it happened that I wounded a\r\nbird or animal, I derived a peculiar pleasure in attending to it till\r\nits recovery was effected.  When I had again collected a tolerable\r\nnumber of friends, and formed some new attachments, a catastrophe\r\nhappened which occasioned me more regrets than any circumstance which\r\nhad previously befallen me in the woods.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Slaughter of the pet birds]\r\n\r\nEarly in the day I had left my family all safe and well; they were of\r\ncourse confined, but plenty of air and light was admitted through the\r\nbars into their dwellings.  I had the satisfaction of thinking they\r\nwere happy, even in their captivity; they were, however, all carried\r\noff at one fell swoop, and I returned only to witness the desolation of\r\nthe scene.  There is a small animal of the weasel species, having the\r\nbump of destructiveness so strongly developed, that it seeks the\r\ndestruction of all other animals that cannot defend themselves from its\r\nattacks; it is called the crabbodaga.  One of these--or there may have\r\nbeen an accomplice in the murderous business--crept between the bars of\r\nthe cage, and killed every bird and animal I possessed, excepting a\r\nmocking-bird I happened to have out with me.\r\n\r\nNone but those who have reared birds from the callow state and have\r\ngiven them a place in their affections, can appreciate my distress at\r\nthis disaster.  The birds had been my companions--had dined, some of\r\nthem, at the same table every day, and over the dessert had amused me\r\nwith their conversation, or delighted me with their music.  Reflecting\r\non this domestic tragedy, I resolved to convert the entire of the\r\nabandoned hut into one large aviary, that is, as soon as the dry season\r\nhad entirely freed the place from water.\r\n\r\nI had very little difficulty in trimming sticks, and binding them\r\ntogether for fences, to confine the birds; but it was not so easy to\r\nrepair the loss of attached friends, who had reposed their confidence\r\nin me, or to teach strangers an agreeable method of conversation upon a\r\ngiven signal.  I could now no longer give dinner-parties at home; I\r\ntherefore intruded on the entertainments given by others, for I did not\r\nenjoy my meals alone.  I did not often take a meal with gregarious\r\nbirds--those who moved in flocks,--yet many of these were excellent\r\ncompanions in private; in a body they were generally too noisy and\r\nfickle in flight to be depended on, except in the morning or evening.\r\n\r\nThe birds usually called social, were my favourites; these are such as\r\nlive in pairs, but assemble in parties at certain hours of the day to\r\ndine on the same tree, sing in concert for an hour, and then part as\r\nthey came, each attended by its mate.  At many of these entertainments\r\nI was permitted to remain, without causing any surprise or confusion;\r\nbut then I behaved with proper decorum, and above all, did not forget\r\nthe manners and habits of those I visited.\r\n\r\nObserving the monkeys to be very fond of the seeds that grew on a tree\r\ncalled the _vanilla_, the Spanish name for scabbard, which the seeds of\r\nthe plant resemble, I one day presumed to join one of their parties at\r\nmeal time, and climbed a tree for that purpose, but was received so\r\nvery uncourteously, that I gave them up as incorrigible boors.  That\r\nthey have no soul for music I have had frequent proofs while listening\r\nto the song of the thrush in the breeding season; a period when these\r\nbirds select an elevated spot, generally the same every day, and pour\r\nforth strains of peculiar melody.  These songs the monkeys not only\r\ndisregard, but continually interrupt with their monotonous howls.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Habits of birds]\r\n\r\nThe habits of birds are very peculiar, and distinctively marked; the\r\nthrush sings to its mate, delighted with the prospect of rearing up a\r\nnew progeny; the nightingale, on the contrary, only ceases to sing when\r\nhis mate arrives to join him; being migrating birds, the male precedes\r\nthe female in making its passage from one country to another, and pours\r\nforth his notes only while waiting for the arrival of the female.\r\n\r\nIf this bird is caught and caged before he is joined by his mate, he\r\nwill continue to sing in confinement, if afterwards, he will be mute.\r\nNothing is more remarkable in birds, or has perhaps been less noticed,\r\nthan their affection for each other, and for callow birds in general.\r\nThe cries from any one nest of birds will set all the old ones within\r\nhearing into a state of extreme agitation, all flying up and down\r\nanxious to inquire what is the matter, and what assistance they can\r\noffer.  He who walks through the woods, and can imitate the cries of\r\nyoung birds, may at all times be certain of collecting old ones around\r\nhim, that is, in the breeding season.\r\n\r\nThe cry of young birds in the nest is in the forest what the cry of\r\nfire or murder is in a city; it alarms all the neighbourhood; and the\r\nknowledge of an enemy to their young being in the vicinity of their\r\nhomes, is to them much the same as going to bed next door to an\r\nincendiary.\r\n\r\nI have seen a blue jay--a very noisy and chattering bird--discover an\r\nowl sitting in his hiding-place, and immediately summon a flock of his\r\nfeathered fraternity to his assistance.  These surrounded the winking\r\n_solitaire_, and opened a fire of abuse on him that might at a distance\r\nbe mistaken for a general disturbance in Billingsgate Market.  The owl\r\nopened and then shut his eyes, as if at first unconscious of the\r\nmeaning of the attack, and asking, \"Can it be me you mean?\"  He,\r\nhowever, was soon made sensible that he would not be suffered to remain\r\nwithin their jurisdiction; and off he went, followed by a mob of birds,\r\nwho hunted him out of the bounds of their district.  Clamorous as the\r\njay is against the owl for eating young birds, he himself I have\r\ndetected in tearing the callow young out of the eggs belonging to other\r\nbirds; yet he never fails to unite with the other feathered inhabitants\r\nof the wood at the cry of danger.\r\n\r\nThe tender assiduities of birds in their attachments is no less\r\nremarkable than their courage in defence of their mates and young ones.\r\nThe male, solicitous to please, uses the tenderest expressions, as\r\nevinced by his manner; sits by his mate as closely as he can; caresses\r\nher with a thousand endearing movements of the body and head: sings to\r\nher his most enchanting warblings; and, as they are seated together, if\r\nhe espies an insect more agreeable to her taste than another, he takes\r\nit up, flies to her with it, spreads his wings over her, and genteelly\r\nputs it into her mouth.  And if a rival or an enemy appear, his courage\r\nin attack soon proves the ardour of his love.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The mocking-bird and snake]\r\n\r\nDuring incubation, the female is no less the object of his solicitude;\r\nas birds have many enemies, the males feel that it is their duty to\r\nwatch over and protect their mates and young ones.  I had every waking\r\nhour opportunities of witnessing their courage, frequently seeing very\r\nsmall birds attack the black snake, darting at its head, and pecking\r\nthe eyes till they either killed or drove away that enemy to their\r\nbrood.  When these contests became doubtful, the females would leave\r\ntheir nests, and hasten to the scene of action to render their mates\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThe mocking-bird seldom fails to kill the snake single-handed,\r\ninstantly afterwards mounting the bush, to pour forth a torrent of song\r\nin token of victory.  These birds mount and descend as their song\r\nswells or dies away; at times darting up with the celerity of an arrow,\r\nas if to recover or recall the last strain of expiring melody.  While\r\nthe mocking-bird thus exerts himself, a bystander, destitute of sight,\r\nwould suppose that the whole of the feathered tribes had assembled to\r\nvie with each other in singing and in deceiving the sportsman, by\r\nimitating the birds of which he was in pursuit.  Their talent at\r\nimitation is so extraordinary, that they can call the mates of almost\r\nevery other bird around them at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe fascinating power ascribed to the black snake is an error.  When a\r\nsnake is discovered in the vicinity of a nest, the male bird mounts a\r\nspray, and in great agitation flutters his wings in a threatening\r\nmanner, till an opportunity offers of flying down to the attack.  In\r\nthese encounters the snake sometimes succeeds in biting the bird, and\r\nin injecting its venom, when the effect of the poison is so sudden, as\r\nto paralyse the further efforts of the latter; hence has arisen the\r\nsupposed power of fascination, and the story of birds flying into the\r\nsnake's jaws.  Instances of this nature I have witnessed, and if I had\r\nnot followed up my observations further, might have fallen into the\r\npopular error of supposed fascination: but my experience informs me,\r\nthat when the bird is said to be spellbound, it is preparing to destroy\r\nan enemy, in which encounter it generally comes off victorious.\r\n\r\nBirds, as a class, possess as much intelligence, and more courage than\r\nany of God's creatures lower in the scale of animals than man.  The\r\ninstincts, or the propensities and precautions of animals, as in birds\r\ndeveloped, are as multifarious and as striking, if not more so, as in\r\nother animals, not excepting the elephant and dog.\r\n\r\nA thrush that I caught in a trap used to catch wasps, and after\r\nplucking the wings off to prevent their escape, pressed the abdomen\r\nwith his bill, to force out the poison of the sting before he swallowed\r\nit.  I have frequently seen birds seize mice and reptiles, and after\r\nexamination reject them.  In all such cases I have found that the prey\r\nthus cast aside was sickly, or infested with lice.  The birds seem to\r\nreason thus: \"If I take this sickly thing to my nest, I shall not only\r\ncarry my young ones unwholesome food, but shall carry a nuisance to\r\nthem, also.\"  Another bird I had in my aviary, would carry food that\r\nwas too hard for his taste to his water, and there let it remain till\r\nit was soaked to his palate.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Departure from the cave]\r\n\r\nLooking over my notched calendar, and transferring it in weeks and\r\nmonths to another stick I was suddenly struck with the length of time I\r\nhad been shut out of society, and how wonderfully the Almighty had\r\npreserved me.  It then occurred to me that I had not exerted myself as\r\nI ought to have done, to free myself from the intricate mazes of the\r\nforest.  Then, reflecting on the regular inundations of the morass, I\r\nthought it was probable that the waters might come from a river, or the\r\nsea; and as they had just then retired, I determined to start off\r\nimmediately, and pursue the margin to its source.  Hitherto, security\r\nat night had induced me to linger about favourite spots; I had now\r\nsurmounted childish fears; still I was sensible of the great risk I\r\nshould run of sleeping, night after night, in the open air; and this\r\nreflection for a time deterred me from carrying out my plan.  At length\r\nI thought of the gipsies I had seen in the green lanes in England, and\r\nthen set to work to manufacture a substitute for the covers they use to\r\nthrow over the hooped sticks at night, with which they were wont to\r\nform low booths.  This I effected by platting and weaving long dried\r\ngrass, and when it was completed, I cut some poles of the lacaria; but\r\nstill doubting my own resolution to break up my establishment, I one\r\nday, with a kind of spasmodic effort, liberated all my newly-collected\r\ndomestic friends and companions, some of which accepted of freedom\r\nrather reluctantly.  My attachments being thus dissolved, the following\r\nmorning I commenced my lonely journey, on the second day of which I\r\nmade a fire near to some shallow water, and was broiling a jay I had\r\nkilled for my supper, when the earth on which I sat began to move, and\r\ninstantly afterwards the embers were scattered about.  Starting to my\r\nfeet with alarm, a crocodile about four feet long showed itself as it\r\nplunged a few yards further off into a pool of mud and water.  The\r\nplace on which I had lighted my fire, was a part of the swamp, crusted\r\nover, probably, by the heat of that day's sun only.  Every hour,\r\nindeed, now brought me in contact with enemies, and exposed me to\r\nprivations I had avoided by making a home in one spot.  But then I had\r\nan object to attain, and I persevered for twenty days, at the end of\r\nwhich I had the mortification to find that I had, like many others in\r\nthe world, progressed not a step, having travelled in a circle, which\r\nbrought me to the very threshold of my recent home.  My chagrin was so\r\npoignant, that I thought the very trees waved in derision at my folly;\r\nand the same day I set out in another direction, which proved to be\r\ndirectly south.\r\n\r\nEvery step I took informed me that I was a trespasser; the scene that I\r\nhad quitted appeared to have been ceded to me by the inhabitants of the\r\nforest, who were willing for me to occupy it without molesting me, or\r\nexhibiting any signs of alarm; but, as I moved from place to place, all\r\nseemed in arms against me.  My insatiable curiosity, too, was\r\neverywhere offensive; nothing escaped my prying propensity, and I even\r\nregretted that I had suffered the crocodile to escape that I might have\r\nintercepted, had I been cool, and have driven to the land for\r\nexamination; I often, indeed, pushed my inquiries beyond the line of\r\nprudence.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An unpleasant nocturnal visitor]\r\n\r\nOne moonlight night I was favoured with a splendid view of the jaguar\r\nunder the influence of a hungry stomach, and in that state I saw him\r\nseize his prey.  I had spread my matting at the lower end of a tree\r\nthat had been torn up by the roots, between which I could creep and\r\nhide myself; at the other end the branches extended into a small glade\r\nor open space; when about midnight I was awaked by a tremendous roar.\r\nAlarmed for my own safety.  I crept between the roots of the tree,\r\npulling the covering after me, and in this situation raised my head so\r\nas to look along the shaft of the fallen timber, about ten yards from\r\nthe end of which I could distinctly discern the jaguar, pacing up and\r\ndown, in a space of not more than thirty yards.  His step was quick and\r\nhurried, but so light that he appeared not to touch the ground; his\r\nswollen and stiffened tail swept the ground, as it moved from side to\r\nside.  I instantly became anxious to ascertain whether his eyes were\r\ndirected towards any particular object, and more especially in the\r\ndirection where I was hid.  I had the satisfaction of seeing their\r\nfierce glance furtively cast in every direction but towards me; indeed,\r\nI must have been invisible to him through the broken branches and\r\nroots, at the distance he was from the tree, and amid the shade that\r\nsurrounded me.\r\n\r\nThe spot he had chosen for his nocturnal promenade was, I have no\r\ndoubt, a deer track, on which he had before in all probability snatched\r\nmany meals.  His impatience evidently increased as his expectations\r\nwere delayed; he quickened, if possible, his step at every turn, till\r\nat length he suddenly paused, and assumed a most exciting attitude.\r\nHis tail for a moment stood out perfectly horizontal, in a line with\r\nhis back; making gentle sweeps, as if of immediate expectation.\r\nSuddenly he crouched on his belly, still moving his tail very gently;\r\nat length the moment arrived: he gave one roar of horrid delight, and\r\nthe next, a deer was in his jaws, and growling, he seized and\r\ndispatched it by twisting the head downwards with his paw.  Finally he\r\ngave the deer a shake, as if to assure himself that life was extinct,\r\nand then, with a fling of the head threw the dead animal across his\r\nback, and was lost in the thicket, depriving me of the satisfaction of\r\nwitnessing his manner of finishing the repast.\r\n\r\nStrong in my resolution to arrive if possible at the extremity of the\r\nforest, I continued to proceed, as I thought, in the same direction;\r\nbut I could not travel every day, being compelled sometimes to watch\r\nthrough the night, and being frequently unable, while moving forward,\r\nto obtain a sufficiency of nutritious food.  When, therefore, I met\r\nwith a convenient retreat, I stayed and refreshed myself till I\r\nacquired strength to undertake new labours.\r\n\r\nSome scenes would irresistibly detain me, and if any one express\r\nsurprise that they should do so when journeying to seek the society of\r\nmy fellow-creatures, I reply that I did not at any time abandon the\r\nhope of success; yet when the uncertainty of my course, without a\r\ncompass or guide, is considered, I never had a right to be very\r\nsanguine in my expectations, use whatever efforts I might.  In a\r\njourney of such a doubtful nature, oftentimes worn down with fatigue of\r\nbody and despair of mind, it was natural to linger on and to rest in an\r\noasis longer than in a desert.\r\n\r\nIn a hot climate, cool retreats have peculiar charms, such as are\r\nunappreciable by those who live in cold countries.  The mere\r\ntopographical traveller may measure a lake, or a river, give the height\r\nand angle of a projecting rock, describe the rush of falling waters\r\ninto an estuary, and trace the course of rivers from their rise to\r\ntheir mouth, but he is unable to give the living tints of nature,\r\ntogether with all their form and colour.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Beauties of the forest]\r\n\r\nNeither the pen nor the pencil can describe the feelings of those who\r\nsympathize with nature in her secret homes of grandeur.\r\n\r\nWhen I first entered the forest, the effect of the sublimity of the\r\nscene was astonishment, in which the beauties were lost; but as\r\nsurprise wore off, these beauties, one by one, stood out to view; and\r\noperating on the senses, produced pleasure in its highest state of\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nIn scenes where bignonias, passifloras, and a thousand other flowers\r\npresented an unceasing display throughout the year, surrounded with\r\nbirds and insects of surpassing beauty, who, possessed of sympathy of\r\nsoul, or an ear for the sweet sounds of nature, would not for a time\r\nforget mortality and live in imaginary eternal bliss; for the charm of\r\nsuch scenes is only dispelled by awakening to the wants and necessities\r\nof the corporeal man.\r\n\r\nMy existence was of such a nature,--one of alternate enjoyment in\r\ncommuning with lonely and enchanting scenes, and of fears lest I should\r\nfall a sacrifice to the dangers that environed my everyday movements.\r\nSometimes I sallied forth to face dangers, and again paused to breathe,\r\nand, for a time, escape them.\r\n\r\nAt length I reached a new scene, consisting of sand-hills, out of which\r\nissued springs of water, uniting at a short distance, where they formed\r\na stream, which appeared to wind over an open country.  In comparison\r\nwith my solitude in the woods, this was a cheering change; and\r\nrecollecting the geographical axiom in my school-books, that all\r\nsprings and rivers ultimately find their way into the sea, I rejoiced\r\nat the chance I had of being extricated from the labyrinth in which I\r\nhad been so long bewildered.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Following the stream]\r\n\r\nIt is the fate of mortals to see the birth of pleasure only to witness\r\nher destruction.  Her commencement is always very nearly connected with\r\nher end.  The instant that gives her birth is generally the same in\r\nwhich she expires.  I had not proceeded far before the waters spread\r\nthemselves over the land, and were lost to the sight.  In one or two\r\nplaces their course terminated as if they were cut off with a knife,\r\none edge being visible and the other in obscurity, exhibiting the\r\nphenomenon of rivers which suddenly take a subterraneous course, to\r\nrise again at another point, leaving the space between perfectly dry.\r\nBeing now in an open country, I ascertained that the course I had\r\ntravelled was directly southward, or towards that part of the horizon\r\nwhich was cut by the sun's culminating, or meridian line; and this\r\ncourse I continued to pursue.  A day and a half again brought me to the\r\nstream, for, as yet, it was not entitled to be called a river.  It now,\r\nhowever, took a direction leading into the wood, among the foliage of\r\nwhich it was lost to the eye.  The emancipation from the forest had\r\ngiven me the greatest possible delight, I therefore could not but\r\nhesitate before I again entered it; yet it was my only certain source\r\nof subsistence in the open country.  I suffered both from hunger and\r\nthirst.  I had, therefore, no alternative but to follow the stream; and\r\non I went, its course winding so much that I began to fear I was\r\ntraversing another circle.  At length, after giving me much wearisome\r\ntoil, it was lost in an impenetrable thicket of wood.  I was now\r\nconstrained to make a very considerable and extended _detour_, in the\r\nhope of again reaching its banks at some merging point.  Three days I\r\njourneyed round an impervious mass of wood, so closely matted that I\r\ncould at no point obtain an entrance.  At the end of that time, I\r\nsuddenly lighted upon the spot where I supposed the waters met in one\r\nbroad reservoir.  Various tributary streams flowed into this spot, and\r\ncontinued their meandering course for many miles.  I hailed the sight\r\nof it with considerable delight, as I had begun to be fearful that I\r\nwas about to lose sight of its course altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nI WITNESS A GRAND CONVULSION IN NATURE, OF WHICH I HAVE A WONDERFUL\r\nESCAPE--AM RESCUED IN THE LAST EXTREMITY, AND ADMITTED INTO A TRIBE OF\r\nINDIANS.\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"Look round and see\r\n  How Providence bestows on all alike\r\n  Sunshine and rain, to bless the fruitful year\r\n  Of different nations, all different faiths;\r\n  And though by several names and titles worshipp'd,\r\n  Heav'n takes the various tribute of their praise.\r\n  Since all agree to own, at least to mean,\r\n  One best, one greatest, and one Lord of all.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A useful hollow tree]\r\n\r\nWhen I arrived at the confluence, as I took it to be, of the streams,\r\nit was Saturday night,--that is, according to my new calendar.  As I\r\ndid not think it lawful to travel on the Sunday, I sought for an\r\neligible place of security, where I might rest, and start thoroughly\r\nrefreshed on the Monday, to solve the problem of the opposing currents.\r\nWith this view I ascended an isolated blasted tree, where I might seat\r\nmyself, and find protection from insidious enemies.  I was delighted to\r\nfind that the trunk was hollow, the only entrance being from the top.\r\nThe tree leaned to the horizon at about an angle of 45 degrees.  After\r\ncarefully examining it, I thought I had satisfied myself that it was\r\nnot pre-occupied by any obnoxious inhabitant; I then dropped into it,\r\nas it were, down a chimney.  Crouching, I was out of sight, but when I\r\nstood erect I had a view of my own desolate situation.\r\n\r\nA species of frogs had just commenced to send forth their peculiar\r\nnoise, which resembles the sound from a stonemason's yard, when I was\r\nannoyed by a number of green frogs, such as dwell in trees; and\r\nendeavouring to brush these from my immediate locality, I discovered a\r\nnumber of the _scolopendra_, or centipedes, from five to eight inches\r\nin length.  Perceiving a hole in the side of the tree, I proceeded to\r\nexpel these formidable insects with my stick, by which means I\r\ndisturbed, in the pulpy part of the decayed wood, a nest of\r\n_scorpions_.  Things in motion soon catch my eye, and in another second\r\nI had regained the earth.  Indisposed, however, to give up such a\r\ncomfortable apartment, I cleared out the whole of the interior, and\r\nthen regained the top of the tree, where I sat for a considerable time\r\nin doubt whether I should retire to rest or keep watch through the\r\nnight.  It was a beautiful evening, and the air was strongly\r\nimpregnated with the aromatic fragrance of the different species of the\r\n_rubiaceae_, the _andiocera_, and _aenothera_.  Moonlight is a thoughtful\r\nperiod in all climates.  I had almost, while watching my own shadow,\r\nforgotten the process of time, when suddenly Cynthia extinguished her\r\nlamp.  Wearied, both in a mental and physical sense, I again, reckless\r\nof consequences, dropped into my cylindrical apartment.  How long I\r\nslept I cannot tell; I was, however, awaked to scenes as remarkable as\r\nthey were terrible and rapid in succession.  A flood of light was\r\nstreaming into my skylight, and I became conscious of a rocking\r\nsensation.  For a moment I concluded that I was again seized with the\r\nvertigo in my head.  A violent sound of rushing waters soon roused me\r\nto a sense of my real danger, and, standing erect, I beheld all the\r\nfirm earth, on which but a few hours previously I had stood, now\r\ncovered with water.  An immense number of aquatic birds were floating\r\non its surface, while others were springing up to branches of the trees\r\nabove, to escape from the enormous serpents, and other monsters of the\r\ndeep, that infest temporary lakes caused by sudden inundations.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An inundation]\r\n\r\nAs I surveyed the scene the waters were still rising, and the tree on\r\nwhich I sat rose with them in an upright position.  Presently it became\r\nstationary, and the water began, gradually to cover its trunk.  I have\r\nsaid that it was an isolated spot: it was a small area in the midst of\r\nthe wood, which appeared to have been cleared by the blast of\r\nlightning, the nearest tree being fifty yards, or more, distant.  Among\r\nother things struggling for life was a fawn, which swam beneath me, and\r\nwas seized by a cayman; while as another monster of the same species,\r\nat least thirty feet long, paused to survey me, with my feet then\r\nnearly touching the water, I impulsively raised my stick in\r\nself-defence, and at this juncture the trunk of the tree suddenly swung\r\nround, and by its action nearly threw me off into the jaws of the\r\ncayman.  The principal part of the roots were torn from the earth, but\r\nmost providentially the only remaining branch on the tree remained\r\nuppermost, which presented me with the opportunity of climbing five or\r\nsix feet higher.  Still, as I could not now turn round with facility, I\r\nremained for a full hour, every moment expecting the monster would\r\nseize me from behind; for the cayman continued to show himself at\r\nintervals, as if certain, in the end, of his prey.  At length the roots\r\nof the decayed tree parted entirely from the earth, and it was carried\r\nforward with the current.  Fortunately the branch, which was my only\r\nchance of escape, still remained elevated.  The cayman did not abandon\r\nhis intended victim till my bark conveyed me among the standing trees,\r\nwhen I seized the opportunity of climbing up one of considerable\r\nheight.  Up to this period all other dangers had been merged in the\r\nimmediate dread of the monster of the deep, but I was now at liberty to\r\ntake a more extended view of the scene, from a fixed position, and I\r\nfound myself in the midst of congregated wild beasts and powerful\r\nreptiles.\r\n\r\nIn the next tree to the one I occupied was an ant-bear, and a little\r\nfarther off I could discern several others.  Monkeys and apes were\r\nswinging and chattering over my head in large numbers; serpents, from\r\nfive to thirty feet long, were crawling on the branches and round the\r\ntrunks of trees, to escape from the flood; tiger-cats, beautifully\r\nstriped, were springing from branch to branch of the green and\r\npurple-heart trees, which here grew to the height of seventy feet;\r\nlizards were seen in such numbers as in many places literally to cover\r\nthe branches of the trees.  All the birds were sending forth sounds of\r\ndissonance, as if stricken with terror; while the shrill voice of the\r\nbird called the pi-pi-yo roused me to the consciousness that the hour\r\nof noon had arrived.\r\n\r\nThe lofty _panax_, _Bignonia_, _copaiva_, rising to a hundred feet in\r\nheight, were peopled with living things, all in apparent consternation\r\nat the sudden changes of the scene.  It was a grand, though an awful\r\nsight for a human being to behold.  Animals of various natures, habits,\r\nand antipathies, were all crowded together in one common place of\r\nrefuge, shaken by the wind, and dreading contact with each other, as\r\nthe violent rushing of the waters bore on their surface numberless\r\nproofs of the havoc made, and still threatening to sweep away and\r\nswallow up every vestige of animal and vegetable creation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Hope in desolation]\r\n\r\nBut let the soul be set on the highest mount of distress, and view the\r\nmost spacious prospect of misery, if the eye be turned towards God\r\ncomfort may be found beyond the horizon, when human strength is vain.\r\n\r\nI lifted up my voice in the wilderness, and lo!  God was there, and I\r\ntook courage, exclaiming, \"The Almighty is the architect of all I see,\r\nHis power stretches over the whole earth and the empty space; He hangs\r\nthe earth and all the ethereal globes upon nothing; and is He not able\r\nto save me?\"  \"I will uphold thee with the right hand of my\r\nrighteousness,\" saith the Lord.  \"The hand which fixes the stars and\r\nguides the planets in their courses is stretched out to preserve His\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\nWith these reflections did I trust in my position, and bid my soul to\r\ntake courage and rely on divine succour.  Fortunately, I had the\r\nremains of a cooked bird in my wallet, which always hung at my back;\r\nand _murucuja_, fruit of one of the passion-flowers, was within my\r\nreach, which I gathered and ate.  The fish also forsook their ordinary\r\nfood, for I could plainly see them feeding on the fruit and berries of\r\nshrubs through which they swam.\r\n\r\nAt length night overtook me, and the moon, I thought, rose with a more\r\nspeaking yet angry countenance than usual, frowning blood-coloured rays\r\non the surface of the water and through the foliage of the wood, still\r\nrendering my fellow-lodgers immediately around me visible, while the\r\nvampire and other species of bats flitted wildly round, like spirits of\r\nthe air; and occasional splashings beneath indicated that the larger\r\ntyrants of the flood were making prey of the weaker inhabitants, or the\r\nlatter were exerting themselves to escape from the jaws of the former.\r\n\r\nThe terrestrial animals seemed, for the most part, in providing for\r\ntheir own safety, to have suspended all operations of warfare, the\r\nscene above the flood in the evening wearing much the same appearance\r\nas throughout the day, excepting that the reptiles were not so\r\nnumerous, the serpents and lizards having found hiding-places in the\r\nholes of the trees or under thick foliage.  After a few hours the moon\r\nwent down and left me\r\n\r\n  \"In the populous solitude of bees and birds,\r\n  And fairy-form'd and many-colour'd things.\"\r\n\r\nIt was now that, like Job, I had to \"gird up my loins like a man;\" for,\r\nas darkness shrouded me, my thoughts naturally reverted to the bear in\r\nthe next tree; I could not but speculate on his movements, and the\r\nprobability of his descending and swimming to invade my territory.\r\nImpressed with this fear, the master one of the hour, I took up a\r\nposition to command the trunk of the tree, where, armed with my stick,\r\nI might oppose him to an advantage.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: A night on the water]\r\n\r\nIt would be futile were I to attempt to describe my sensations during\r\nthe night.  Could words be found expressive enough for the purpose,\r\nthey should have been penned at the instant they were felt; feelings\r\nunder such extraordinary circumstances cannot be recalled, or\r\nappreciated only at the time they were excited.  Words, in description,\r\nstand for general ideas in Nature's chart; ten thousand sensations and\r\nforms enter of themselves into the sanctuary of the mind.  I can only\r\nsay that I spent the night in prayer for the coming morn.  It, however,\r\npassed without involving me in any encounter.  \"Now, men see not the\r\nbright light which is in the clouds; but the wind passeth and cleareth\r\nthem away.\"\r\n\r\nI thought it was an interminable night, and long before morning dawned,\r\nas the first glimmer of light tinged the eastern horizon, I strained my\r\neyes to assure myself of its actual approach; yet what hope could it\r\nbring me?--none, in prospect; notwithstanding which, latent hope was\r\nnot wholly extinct.  A vague idea possessed me that I might find some\r\nfloating tree to carry me to the nearest shore.  At length, indolently,\r\nas I thought, the morning did appear, rendering surrounding objects\r\nvisible.  The bear was still in the tree, coiled up like a cat, in a\r\nforked branch, apparently asleep.  His bearship had not even the\r\npoliteness to pass the compliment of the day by noticing me; and noon\r\nagain arrived, bringing with it utter despair.  For some time I had\r\nbeen watching a log of timber, in the hope that it would float within\r\nmy reach, when I distinctly heard the sound of human voices.  My heart\r\nleaped up with joy; and the coincidence of the appearance of a rainbow\r\nat the same instant, operated like a reprieve to a malefactor in the\r\nhands of the executioner.\r\n\r\nI was so much elated, that I actually should have neglected to have\r\ncalled out for assistance, had not the same voices again addressed my\r\near more distinctly, when I used my vocal powers with all my might; but\r\nI had no response, and my heart was again, sinking within me, when I\r\nobserved a canoe approaching.  It contained two Indians; one was using\r\nthe paddle, the other directing his attention to the spot from whence\r\nmy voice proceeded.  A few seconds brought them under the tree, and an\r\ninvitation, by signs, for me to descend, and accept of my emancipation\r\nfrom their hands.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The charms of solitude]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the terrors and privations of my wild life, there\r\nwas a charm in it which is inexplicable; and I paused ere I parted with\r\nit.  Men whose whole life has been identified with civilization may not\r\nunderstand this feeling; but long association with nature in her own\r\nscenes of unlimited grandeur and profuse bounty, cannot be broken off\r\nwithout a struggle.  In return for all the blessings nature bestows on\r\nher children of the woods, she requires no sacrifice of liberty; free\r\nand unconstrained she permits them to roam throughout her domains; to\r\nrobe or unrobe, as their taste may dictate; to rest when fatigued, and\r\nto rise when refreshed.  Nature does not mask misery with the face of\r\nhappiness, nor dress misfortune in the guise of prosperity; free and\r\nuncontrolled, her children are invited to help themselves at her\r\nmunificent board; while in the narrow paths of civilized life, even the\r\nboasted reason of man is incapable of conferring happiness on society.\r\nBut with the green grass and soft moss for a carpet, umbrageous trees\r\nfor a shade, the murmuring stream for the ear, together with the sound\r\nof the breeze amongst the leaves to woo reflection, the syrens of\r\nvicious pleasure may be avoided, and the disquietudes of life be\r\nforgotten.  Like a true citizen of the world, I had become enamoured\r\nwith liberty, and with the instinct of a denizen of the forest, I\r\nshrank from the presence of man.  My situation was perilous, death\r\nbeing inevitable if I remained in the tree; for in a short time sleep\r\nmust overcome me, and in that state, I must fall into the waters\r\nbeneath.  Reluctantly, therefore, I dropped into the canoe, with the\r\nfeelings of a bird who darts into a cage to escape the talons of the\r\nhawk--an incident, by the way, which once brought both the fugitive and\r\nthe hawk into my trap.  No captured African slave could feel the loss\r\nof liberty more than I did when the Indians assigned me a seat in the\r\ncanoe, which proceeded to join a company consisting of eleven persons.\r\nThey were a fishing party that had left their wonted haunts to avail\r\nthemselves of the flood, a period when their efforts were generally\r\nrewarded with great success.  One canoe was nearly filled with the\r\nproduct of the first draught, and they were in the act of drawing\r\nanother as I appeared amongst them.\r\n\r\nThey were all well-grown men, nearly naked, like myself, very placid in\r\ntheir demeanour, and showed great anxiety to relieve my distress,\r\noffering me food and drink.  Indeed, their manners were so urbane and\r\npleasing, that in a very short time I recovered from my depression of\r\nspirits, and congratulated myself on my good fortune in falling into\r\ntheir company.  They wore large grass-platted hats to defend the head\r\nfrom the heat of the sun, and had each a hammock made of the same\r\nmaterials, which as night approached, they slung from the branches of\r\ntrees, and calmly laid themselves down to survey the confusion of\r\nnature which the sudden inundation had occasioned.\r\n\r\nWith the party was a youth about my own age, who at once attached\r\nhimself to me; he manifested his disappointment and concern that he\r\ncould not make himself understood by words, and in a very short time\r\nintimated his intention of undertaking my education by showing me the\r\nimplements in use and calling them by name, till I not only recollected\r\nthem, but acquired accuracy of pronunciation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Indian village]\r\n\r\nTwo days subsequently to my rescue from the tree, I was taken to the\r\nIndian village, about ten miles from the border of the forest.  It\r\nconsisted of fifteen huts on an elevated spot, distant a half-mile from\r\na fine river, which ebbed and flowed with the tide.  It was this\r\ncircumstance that had occasioned my embarrassment when following the\r\nstream and suddenly meeting with a contrary current.\r\n\r\nOn my arrival at the village I was struck with the absence of curiosity\r\nor surprise which a stranger from another race generally excites, even\r\nin civilized localities.  Neither men, women, or children appeared to\r\nbestow on me any peculiar notice, nor did they, as far as I could\r\nlearn, express any desire to know how I came amongst them, or from\r\nwhence I came.  No overseer or other parish officer was called in to\r\nprovide me with food and then dispute my right to eat.  I was at once\r\nled to the hut of the father of my young friend, and received as one of\r\nthe family, in which there were two wives and two families--one mother\r\nwith three, and another with four children.  Plurality of wives was the\r\ncustom of this Indian community, and yet they lived in perfect harmony;\r\nthere were no jealousies or bickerings; the progeny of each shared\r\nalike the affection and care of both mothers, who laboured with equal\r\nzeal in the culture of cassava or manioc, the roots of which they\r\ngrated and made into bread.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous tribes of these Indians, but they all spoke the\r\nsame language.  The tribe I was with were called Galibis; they were\r\nremarkable alike for their humanity and intelligence.  Indeed, they\r\npossessed all the moral qualities of civilized society, without its\r\nforms and most of its vices, especially the one of coveting their\r\nneighbours' goods.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Habits of the Indians]\r\n\r\nDuring the time I was with them, a period of eighteen months, I never\r\nheard of a charge of theft.  Land was as plentiful as air and water;\r\nthere could not, therefore, be any motive to steal, if we except\r\nidleness,--a vice which prevails more in cities than in the wilds of\r\nnature.  Numerous families sometimes live in one common large hut; yet\r\nthere are no quarrels to disturb their harmony; and such is their\r\nhospitality that he who is fatigued with hunting may always depend on\r\nrepose in the nearest dwelling.\r\n\r\nTheir language is peculiarly harmonious, rich with synonyms, and is\r\nrepresented by those who have studied its grammatical construction, to\r\nbe complicated and ingenious in syntax.  Intelligent as they are, they\r\nhave at all times rejected the arts and all instruction, from their\r\ngreat love of independence.  The countenances of all are stereotyped\r\nwith benevolence, and their conversation is fraught with maxims that\r\ninculcate the practice of charity to all the human race.  They are not\r\nwithout a sense of pride, yet discourage it in practice.  It requires\r\nno broker to make a written catalogue of their household furniture:\r\ntheir weapons are bows and arrows, and a short dart which they force\r\nthrough a reed with the breath, bringing down birds on the wing with\r\nsurprising dexterity.  A flat stone on which the women bake bread, and\r\na rough one on which to grate the root of cassava; a hammock, a\r\nhatchet, a comb, and a broken piece of looking-glass in a rude frame,\r\ncomprise the whole of their furniture.  What few vessels they had were\r\nill made,--not any improvement on those I formed from clay for the use\r\nof my aviary when in the woods.\r\n\r\nThey have no code of laws, nor have they a word in the language by\r\nwhich to convey the idea of laws; yet they have the same word as in\r\nHebrew to express God, by which they understand supreme master.  They\r\nhave a magistrate or elder, to whom any matter of disputation is\r\nreferred, and by him summarily and finally settled.  Fire they obtain\r\nby rubbing two pieces of wood together; and for cooking, this is made\r\non the ground, over which they suspend their vessels in the rudest\r\nmanner.  Although these people wear no clothes, properly so called,\r\nthey are very fond of ornaments; as amulets and charms, those obtained\r\nfrom the ivory-billed woodpecker were most in vogue.  No people in the\r\nworld, perhaps, are more remarkable for acute observation.  If you name\r\nany kind of bird, or other animal, to them, that is to be found in this\r\npart of the globe, instantly they imitate its action and tones of\r\nvoice.  The notes of birds they give with surprising accuracy.  They\r\nare very expert swimmers, and some of the women and children spend the\r\nchief of their time in the water.  The men fish, and hunt, and when not\r\nso employed, which happens three or four days in the week, they remain\r\nin their hammocks, and amuse themselves with their implements, in the\r\nrepairs of which, and in conversation, all their leisure is spent.\r\nThey possess all the qualities to form good sportsmen, and to take the\r\ncommand of others--having great presence of mind and promptitude of\r\naction.  I know not which most to admire, their skill in discovering\r\ngame, or their manner of taking it.  They entertain the loftiest\r\nsentiments of chivalrous honour, and their courage always rises with\r\nincreasing difficulty; it \"smiles in danger stern and wild,\" and is\r\nsuperior to circumstances.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day after my emancipation from the loneliness of the\r\nforest I accompanied a fishing party to the same spot from whence I had\r\nbeen taken.  It was a favourite locality for hunting the ant-bear, and\r\nwhen the waters were out, for taking crabs and oysters, which were\r\ncaught in large numbers among the trees and shrubs that were more or\r\nless covered by the flood.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Great Spirit of the Indians]\r\n\r\nUnder the assiduous tuition of my young friend, whose name was _Pecoe_,\r\nI rapidly progressed in a knowledge of his language, and could not\r\nrefrain from making many reflections on his method of teaching as\r\ncompared with my European schoolmaster's.  Pecoe, I considered, had\r\nadopted a natural mode of instruction, while the system of the other\r\nwas wholly artificial, and tedious in practice.  My teacher was as\r\nanxious to be taught himself as to teach me, and when we were able to\r\nconverse, asked ten thousand questions relative to my country and the\r\nstate of society in it.  Whether my long residence in the woods had\r\ndisqualified me to be an advocate for the cause of civilization I know\r\nnot, but at all my descriptions of it, Pecoe shook his head, and was\r\nevidently under an impression that my countrymen must be a very unhappy\r\nrace of people.  On one occasion, when conversing on our difference of\r\ncolour, and on the human races generally, he said, \"I will tell you how\r\nit happened: you know that there are three great spirits, all good,\r\nthough each is greater than the other.  The great spirit of all one day\r\nsaid to the lowest spirit, 'make a man, and let me see him.'  The\r\nspirit took some clay and made a man; but when the Great Spirit saw\r\nhim, he shook his head, and said he was too white.  He then ordered the\r\nspirit next to himself in goodness to make a man, who tried his skill\r\nwith charcoal--burnt wood; but the Great Spirit again shook his head,\r\nand said he was too black.  The Great Spirit then determined to try\r\nhimself, and taking some red earth, made the Indians, which pleased him\r\nvery much.\"  When I told him that the Great Spirit in his great\r\ngoodness had so ordered it that every one should think his own colour\r\nthe best, he replied, that it was not possible for either a black or a\r\nwhite man to be so stupid as to be satisfied with the colour of his\r\nskin, stigmatized as he, Pecoe, thought both races were, by\r\nbarbarities.  When I explained to him the various grades of civilized\r\nsociety, his quick apprehension broke out in the most indignant terms,\r\ndenouncing the system as one dictated by a demon.  Rich and poor!\r\n\"What good,\" he asked, \"could arise from allowing one to take all, and\r\ngiving nothing to the other?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pecoe's ideas of society]\r\n\r\nI replied, that the wisdom of the Great Spirit (God) was recognised in\r\nhis anticipation of the wisdom of man, by providing him with original\r\nprinciples of his own, which were given to regulate, not excite\r\ndesires.  Thus the sense of property is germinated in very early\r\nchildhood, which sense I maintained generated a moral feeling, and a\r\nprinciple of justice and equity.  My young friend, after a moment's\r\nthoughtful pause, stoutly gave the negative to my premises,--that the\r\nsense of property was developed in early life; he argued that the\r\ndesire exhibited by children to handle things, and which we erroneously\r\ncall a desire to possess them, is nothing more than a natural desire to\r\nexercise the physical senses on objects of the external world, through\r\nwhich only could they educate the powers of the body for healthful and\r\nmanly purposes of life.  Those things which some call children's\r\nplaythings, he held to be _bona fide_ tools, without which, whether\r\nthey were wooden horses, paper boats, a doll's head, or a piece of\r\nstick, they could no more rise out of a state of childhood than a man\r\ncould go to sea without a canoe.  He therefore denied the inference,\r\nthat because children manifest a disposition to snatch or handle\r\neverything they can reach, it is an indication of natural\r\nacquisitiveness.  The mind, he said, was wholly disengaged from these\r\nmatters at an early age; employment for the organs of the five senses,\r\ntogether with an instinctive desire to promote their development, were\r\nthe true causes of children quarrelling for possessions.  He instanced\r\ntheir having no abiding attachment for any one particular toy, however\r\nexpensive or attractively constructed, always casting away one thing to\r\nhandle another, the various forms of which gave exercise to different\r\nmuscles, and imparted new sensations of pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe object I have in presenting my readers with a few of Pecoe's\r\nopinions is to illustrate the different ideas elicited in the minds of\r\nmen by diverse circumstances of life and education.  I scarcely need\r\ninform them that, in committing to paper my friend's notions, I have\r\ndressed them up in my own language.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion Pecoe closed the conversation by remarking that the\r\nnature of society, such as I had depicted in England, appeared to\r\ncharge the Great Spirit with having at some early period thrown upon\r\nthe earth all His gifts in a heap, for a general scramble, on the\r\ncondition that the posterity of those who succeeded in first picking\r\nthem up should for ever live in idleness, and become the masters of the\r\nposterity of those whose ancestors had been unsuccessful in snatching\r\nfrom their fellow-men more than their own share.  He continued: \"It was\r\nhard to believe such a state of society could exist, and thought the\r\nEvil Spirit must have put it into my head;\" meaning that I had drawn\r\nupon my own imagination for the sketch.  The incomprehensible part of\r\nthe system to Pecoe was, that some could be luxuriating in plenty and\r\nothers be starving at the same time in one country.\r\n\r\nWarfare was unknown to his race, because the practice of good-will and\r\nthe friendly offices of mutual assistance were universal among them,\r\nand annihilated every motive to aggrandisement, and consequently the\r\ndisposition was never brought out.  Bear in mind, reader, that I am\r\ndescribing no Utopia.  When, therefore, I spoke of our numerous wars,\r\nand explained that it was those who had been unfortunate at the first\r\ngeneral scramble, as he designated it, who risked their lives in\r\nbattle, fighting for their wealthy masters, his incredulity rose so\r\nhigh as to doubt my veracity, and for some time subsequently I thought\r\nhe seemed to shun my society, appearing very pensive and lonely in his\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pecoe as a nurse]\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight after the above conversation I was suddenly taken\r\nwith violent symptoms of fever, when Pecoe was immediately by my side,\r\nassiduously attending to all my wants with the tenderness of a nurse.\r\nThe physician, or pee-ay-man, was applied to, who offered up prayers to\r\nthe Bad Spirit for my recovery;--for it is a part of their creed that\r\nthe Good Spirit is too good to do any one harm, and therefore it is the\r\nMalicious Spirit that must be conciliated.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose a number of incantations were performed, after which\r\nthe physician continued to parade from hut to hut, howling and\r\nperforming another series of incantations throughout the night, at\r\nintervals calling to see if any improvement had taken place in the\r\nhealth of his patient.  As it was the practice of every family to burn\r\na fire through the night, I could from my hammock see this juggler\r\nstalking to and fro, looking more like a demon than a minister of\r\ncomfort in sickness.\r\n\r\nPecoe proved the best physician.  He never left me, continuing to\r\nadminister comfort to me in every possible way and manner.  Among other\r\nservices he relieved me, at my request, from the mummeries of the\r\npee-ay-man, aptly urging that, as the spirits of my country were not\r\nthe same as theirs, he might by his interference make them angry\r\ninstead of conciliating them.  But the women, who really felt an\r\ninterest in my fate, were not so easily satisfied, they placed implicit\r\nreliance on the skill of the pee-ay-man, and were angry with Pecoe for\r\nsending him away.  \"Never mind,\" said he, coolly, to some remarks that\r\ncensured his conduct, \"I am as good a doctor as he is; and if I am hot,\r\ndon't the Great Spirit brush away the flies from the animal without a\r\ntail?\"\r\n\r\nMy disease grew worse, and rapidly hastened to its crisis.  Pecoe in\r\nevery stage sought for new sources of comfort: he collected silk-grass,\r\nand daily made new pillows for my head, when they were wetted with the\r\ncold water he applied to my temples.  He constantly moistened my lips\r\nwith slices of pineapple, only occasionally leaving me, to go in search\r\nof the jelly cocoa-nut, which in an unripe state has but a thin skin,\r\nbut contains more liquor.  As the fever subsided, these grateful\r\ndraughts contributed much towards my recovery, and without doubt\r\nhastened the period of final restoration to health, when I said to my\r\nfriend, \"You may now set up as physician to the tribe, and supersede\r\nthe pee-ay-man.\"  The remark brought a smile from his lips, as he\r\nreplied, \"I have not such a mean spirit as to endure to be laughed at\r\nby all the people.  Do you, then, really believe that these pretenders\r\nto superior knowledge are esteemed, or that any in the place have faith\r\nin their arts?\"\r\n\r\n\"If not,\" said I, \"why tolerate them, and why not apply to the Great\r\nand Good Spirits themselves for help?\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Pecoe's prudence]\r\n\r\n\"Why!\" rejoined Pecoe, \"because too many like deception more than\r\nhonesty, and prefer listening to falsehood rather than to truth.  My\r\nfather and all his friends have secretly laughed at the impostor all\r\ntheir days, yet in public give him countenance, and also frown on the\r\nchildren who would doubt the efficacy of his tricks, or his ability to\r\nsolve dreams and foretell events.  I myself,\" he continued, \"sometimes\r\ndoubt my right to disregard the proffered services of these men.  This\r\narises, perhaps, from the general countenance they have from all the\r\ntribes, and the force of custom; for I seldom give myself the trouble\r\nto investigate their claim to respect; I endure their arts, because the\r\nmajority patronise them, though I never open my lips in their defence.\r\nIt is an ungracious task to make yourself more wise than your\r\nneighbours; even if you should be successful, you must inevitably make\r\nenemies without gaining new friends, people do not like to be told that\r\nthey have been in error all their lives, or to believe that their\r\nforefathers were foolishly credulous.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE INDIANS--I ARRIVE AT MY FATHER'S FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"What fancied zone can circumscribe the soul,\r\n  Who, conscious of the source from whence she springs,\r\n  By Reason's light, or Resolution's wings,\r\n  Spite of her frail companion, dauntless goes\r\n  O'er Libya's deserts, and through Zembla's snows?\r\n  She bids each slumb'ring energy awake,--\r\n  Another touch, another temper take;\r\n  Suspends th' inferior laws that rule o'er clay.\r\n  The stubborn elements confess her sway;\r\n  Man's little wants his low desires refine,\r\n  And raise the mortal to a height divine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the darkness in which my friend Pecoe had been brought\r\nup, I was impressed with the notion that his soul was sufficiently\r\nalive to receive the great truths of Christianity.  I therefore\r\nresolved again to introduce the subject, and make an effort to engross\r\nhis attention.  I commenced by impressing on his mind that my\r\ncountrymen were a race acknowledged to be inferior to none other, and\r\nthat they worshipped only One Great Spirit, the Maker of the heavens\r\nand the earth, together with all things visible and invisible.  He\r\nsurprised me by admitting that these things had engaged much of his\r\nattention, and that his mind was now made up on the question; his\r\nconviction being that the heavens and the earth had existed from\r\neternity, and would continue the same to eternity.\r\n\r\nI explained to him that nothing endured for ever but the power of God;\r\nthat all things were constantly undergoing a process of change; that\r\nthe globe we inhabited had a beginning, and, consequently, like\r\ninferior bodies, would have an end; that God permitted the dissolution\r\nof one body, and the birth of another, at periods appointed, to the end\r\nthat the whole of his designs might arrive at perfection, and no\r\nabsolute loss be sustained.  Pecoe heard me out with great patience,\r\nthen shook his head, and enquired how it came that my father should\r\nknow better than his?  When, however, I spoke of the existence of the\r\nsoul in another and better world, and endeavoured to illustrate that\r\ncertainty by saying, in the dissolution of bodies nothing perished but\r\ntheir forms, and that the soul when it abdicated its decaying vessel,\r\nthe body, was translated to another, and a purer state of existence, he\r\nevidently looked on me as being insane.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Attempts at conversion]\r\n\r\nI was disappointed,--was vexed at my inability to awaken him to a sense\r\nof what all mankind, more or less, in some form, have acknowledged,\r\nnamely, a future state of existence.  I now urged that all human beings\r\nwere sensible of relations not subject to the senses, and therefore\r\npossessed sensibilities distinct from the body.  That they could\r\ncompare, and therefore had judgment; that they retained, and therefore\r\nhave memory; that they possessed freedom of choice, and therefore have\r\nwill.  I then said, if to these we add instinct, there are five\r\nfaculties of the soul; adding, Reason compares those ideas immediately\r\ntransmitted to the memory; imagination is the same faculty exercised on\r\nthe same objects differently combined, having no similitude in nature.\r\n\r\n\"These,\" replied Pecoe, \"are all your own thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nHaving from early infancy been accustomed, both morning and evening, to\r\noffer up my prayers to God, and having, when in the wilds of nature,\r\nfound in this practice much solace, I did not fail while with the\r\nIndians to continue the custom; yet none of the people had hitherto\r\ntaken any notice of my devotion.  At length Pecoe inquired my motives,\r\nasking what I expected to gain by the practice.\r\n\r\nI replied, that we had all daily wants, and that in the morning I\r\npetitioned the Great Spirit--my God---to supply them, and that in the\r\nevening I returned thanks for the protection and supplies I had\r\nreceived.  I further explained, that prayer was the voice of sin to Him\r\nwho alone can pardon it; that it was the petition of poverty, the\r\nprostration of humility, the confidence of trust, the feeling of\r\nhelplessness, and the compunctions of the soul.  All this I put in the\r\nmost simple form of language, and I have reason to think that he fully\r\nunderstood the feeling I endeavoured to convey.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, he asked me whether I had not food enough to eat, and\r\nwhat it was the Evil Spirit had made me do that troubled me so much?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Conversation on prayer]\r\n\r\nIn vain did I labour to impress his mind with a sense of the necessity\r\nthere is for all to worship the Giver of life and all other blessings,\r\nand that by intreating the One God to protect us, the value of his\r\ngifts was enhanced, and that there was an inexpressible delight in\r\ncommitting ourselves to the care and guidance of one who is infinitely\r\nable to protect us in the right path.\r\n\r\n\"The Spirit,\" said he, \"is good, and will do nothing wrong--he will not\r\nlisten to what you tell him.\"\r\n\r\nI replied by saying that we could not tell God of anything that he did\r\nnot already know, and that prayer and thanksgiving were due from us all\r\nto one so beneficent.  I then explained to him that his condition of\r\ndarkness in religious matters was once the condition of all mankind,\r\nand that it was only by reflection, and the intercommunication of\r\nminds, that the little light our forefathers possessed was obtained,\r\nuntil at length God sent his only Son to reveal the truth to us.  I\r\nthen repeated the Lord's Prayer, and promised to teach it to him in his\r\nown language if he would use it.\r\n\r\nHe replied that he must have time to consider of it.  A few days after\r\nhe requested that I would not talk in that way any more to him, adding,\r\nthat they were all my own sayings, meaning they were things of my own\r\ninvention.\r\n\r\n\"You have consulted your father,\" said I.  He acknowledged that he had,\r\nlaughing at the same time, as if I had been a subject of their\r\nridicule.  Up to that moment I had flattered myself that I should have\r\nbeen spiritually of service to him, and perhaps through him, to more of\r\nhis race.  His father, however, was an enemy to civilized man, and\r\ninimical to innovations of every kind.\r\n\r\nIt appeared from a traditional story, which Pecoe subsequently related\r\nme, that at some former period these people had been visited by a party\r\nof missionaries, the particulars of which I an induced to give, as a\r\ncaution to gentlemen who labour in such arduous undertakings as those\r\nof converting heathens to Christianity.\r\n\r\n\"Some white men,\" said Pecoe, \"came here a long time since, and brought\r\nstrange talk about the Great Spirit and his Son, (that is, about our\r\nblessed Saviour), to which our people agreed to listen, upon condition,\r\nthat every time they attended they should receive a bottle of rum.\r\nThey did attend,\" continued Pecoe, \"but in a short time the white men\r\nwanted them to come and listen for nothing, and so broke their\r\ncontract.\"  Scrupulously punctual to their own engagements, the\r\nIndians, immediately on the withholding of the rum, took a prejudice\r\nagainst the missionaries, which no subsequent conduct on the part of\r\nthe latter could remove, or perhaps will ever efface from the memory of\r\nthe former.  Thus has a stumblingblock been placed in the way of all\r\nfuture adventurers among them in the cause of Christianity.  As soon as\r\nI was made acquainted with these particulars, I resolved to undertake\r\nthe defence of the missionaries' conduct, and at least, lessen the\r\nprejudice against them.  With this view, I availed myself of the first\r\nlarge assemblage of the natives, and opened the subject by inquiring\r\nhow long it was since the white men had visited them, which way they\r\ncame, and lastly, by what road they returned? suggesting, that perhaps\r\nthe same road might lead me to a European colony, where I might have a\r\nchance of hearing from my friends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Defence of the missionaries]\r\n\r\nAn aged Indian replied to these inquiries, adding, that he had no great\r\nopinion of the white men who came there; and on asking how they had\r\nconducted themselves, he related the story in nearly the same words as\r\nI had heard it from Pecoe.  I then explained the good intentions of the\r\npersons who subscribed money to spread the truths of the gospel, and\r\nthe great sacrifices made by those who consented to give up the charms\r\nof civilized life for the good of the poor unenlightened heathen.  I\r\nthen went on to say, that with respect to the presents of rum, it was\r\nnatural, after the missionaries had taken the trouble to study their\r\nlanguage, and to travel so far, to adopt any means to secure a hearing,\r\nwithout which, no good could possibly accrue to the objects of their\r\nmission.  Although, I continued, they might at first hold out some\r\ninducement to be heard, yet it was unreasonable to expect that persons\r\nso far away from home and their resources could continue to find the\r\nmeans of making repeated presents in order to tempt persons to their\r\nown good.\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished, some of the Indians laughed, others shook their\r\nheads, indicating disapprobation, and a hint that I had better be\r\nsilent.  Upon the whole, though I pushed the matter somewhat strongly,\r\nI failed in making any impression on the auditors.\r\n\r\nWith regard to natural objects, I question if there be a more acute and\r\nobserving people in the whole world; yet they are wholly a people of\r\nfeelings, being evidently deficient in intellect.  Their imagination\r\nand understanding are both at a low ebb, as I could never extend their\r\nideas beyond their own path of life.  At times I gave Pecoe credit for\r\npossessing a more lively imagination than others of his tribe; but as I\r\nknew more of him, this impression died away.  In the highly cultivated\r\nwalks of society, manhood is the period when the feelings are\r\npredominant.  Imagination prevails in youth, and the understanding in\r\nold age.  These people are in the middle stage of progress; and as they\r\npossess the purest moral notions of right and wrong, cannot be\r\nincapable of receiving the truths of revealed religion.  The highest\r\ndegree of moral elevation can only be attained by carefully cherishing\r\nthe more benevolent and kindlier feelings of nature; that is, by\r\ncultivating the good passions, and throwing into disuse the bad ones.\r\nThe Indians with whom I lived, effected these objects in a very high\r\ndegree; for I never saw an instance of any violent exhibition of temper\r\namong them, and it was always a matter of astonishment to me to see how\r\nexceeding tractable their children were without severity on the part of\r\nthe parents.\r\n\r\nIn the moral sense of the word, they were good; and if they had been\r\nChristians, would have been deemed examples for more refined nations.\r\n\r\n  \"A good man, and an angel! these between,\r\n  How thin the barrier?  What divides their fate?\r\n  Perhaps a moment, or perhaps a year;\r\n  Or, if an age, it is a moment still.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote will not only illustrate the kind feelings of\r\nthe Indian's heart, but also exhibit his delicacy in bestowing a\r\nfavour.  I had for some time been uneasy at not being able to\r\ncontribute, by my exertions, a fair share towards the provisions of the\r\ncommon stock of those with whom I resided; and this uneasiness was\r\nfrequently expressed to Pecoe, the principal difficulty being the want\r\nof a canoe--for these vessels were not constructed in general to carry\r\nmore than one person; I was thus precluded from sharing in the daily\r\nexcursions on the water.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Gift of a canoe]\r\n\r\nPecoe, as I have said, knew that I felt this want, and one morning\r\nsurprised and delighted me, after a walk in the woods, where he pointed\r\nout the silk cotton tree as the material out of which they made canoes.\r\n\"Why,\" exclaimed he, as he took a turn towards an inlet of the great\r\nriver, \"here is a canoe already made for you; come, help me to launch\r\nit, and let us see how it fits you when afloat.\"  I had recently, for\r\nseveral long intervals, missed him, and having, when inquiring the\r\ncause of his absence, received equivocal replies, I thought it was\r\noccasioned by some duty connected with his family, and had in\r\nconsequence forborne to notice it again.  He had, however, been in the\r\nwood, fashioning a canoe for my use, being the most valuable present he\r\ncould, at that juncture, have made me; and the manner in which he\r\nconducted the matter, considerably enhanced its value.  I was now as\r\nrich in property as any of the natives, whose ambition seldom soars\r\nbeyond the possession of a canoe and a stock of hunting and fishing\r\nimplements, which my friend Pecoe did not forget to provide with the\r\ncanoe.\r\n\r\nMy health being perfectly restored, I now joined in all the sports\r\nfollowed by the natives, having previously, at Pecoe's earnest\r\nsolicitation, learned to swim.  Time ran on smoothly, the morning\r\ninvited me to the woods (my natural home) to hunt for game.\r\n\r\n  \"On a sweet shining morning, thus drawn out,\r\n    It seem'd what man was made for, to look round\r\n  And trace the full brook, that, with clamorous route,\r\n    O'er fallen trees and roots, black curling, wound\r\n  Through glens, with wild brakes scatter'd all about.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe days did not linger in their progress, nor did night arrive too\r\nsoon, the changes being all attended with enjoyments.\r\n\r\n    \"Night bringeth sleep\r\n    To the forest deep,\r\n  The forest bird to its nest,\r\n    To care, bright hours,\r\n    And dreams of flowers,\r\n  And that balm to the weary--rest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscontent is man's great enemy.  I believe that, constitutionally, I\r\nwas fitted to enjoy any station to which the Almighty, in his wisdom,\r\nmight call me; yet even contentment may be carried to an extreme, and\r\ndegenerate into apathy, or the want of a healthful spirit into\r\nindolence.\r\n\r\nSoft leisure hath her charms, and the bliss of her votaries is to bask\r\nin summer rays through the day under the greenwood tree; but however\r\nsoothing or pleasant this may be to the reflective mind, the common\r\nduties of life should not be neglected.  I had parents, relations, and\r\nfriends, all of whom had more or less been rendered unhappy by my loss\r\nin the woods; and I now became impressed with a notion that I had not\r\nbeen sufficiently active in using means for my restoration.\r\n\r\nI had indeed escaped the mazes of the forest by the inundation--an\r\nevent in which the hand of Providence was conspicuous; for had not the\r\nflood-gates of the firmament been opened, I might still have remained\r\nin my forest prison.  I now asked myself why I did not stir and exert\r\nall the energies the same Providence had bestowed on me, to reach the\r\nnearest European colony and seek advice as to the proper mode of\r\nproceeding to discover the home of my parents.  All my moments of\r\nleisure were now filled up with self-reproaches.  The deep solitude of\r\nthe woods, I thought, had enchanted me, and now the wild charm of a\r\nfree and roving life was weaning me from duty.  These were errors\r\nwhich, I thought, demanded a rigid retribution; yet at intervals I was\r\nin no want of excuses to extenuate my conduct.  I reflected on the\r\nextraordinary flexibility of our nature, which accommodates and adapts\r\nitself to all circumstances; and, that the reality of our existence is\r\nthe present moment, the exigencies of which are inimical to prudent\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\nOf man's generic character there is much yet to be written; the change\r\nof climate, food, scenery, society, together with a thousand contingent\r\ncircumstances that follow in their train, all produce effects\r\nunappreciable by those whose lives have been bounded by one circle.  Of\r\nall animals, man best endures the changes of food and climate.  It\r\ntherefore follows that his physical construction is more changeable;\r\nbut in proportion as the body undergoes a change, and adapts itself to\r\nthe circumstances of its situation, so will the feelings, temper, and\r\nmind also undergo some change, and more or less affect the character of\r\nthe individual.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Forgetfulness of home]\r\n\r\nIn reference to my own case, and the experience derived from it, this\r\nis the best solution I can give of the passive submission with which I\r\naccommodated myself to the manner of life into which my waywardness had\r\ncast me.  If we pass from man to the influence of climate on other\r\nanimals, the effect on dogs is very remarkable.  In Kamtschatka,\r\ninstead of the dog being faithful and attached to his master, he is\r\nfull of deceit and treachery; he does not bark in the hot parts of\r\nAfrica, nor in the extreme cold countries of the north; in Greenland he\r\nloses his fitness for hunting and his character for docility.  If this\r\nsubject were pursued, it might be added that the African slaves, when\r\nremoved from their own country to the West Indies, undergo a marked\r\nchange of character.  The American settlers too, have changed in\r\ncharacter since their first settlement in that country, as also have\r\nthe Anglo-New Hollanders.  The temperate zones appear to be the most\r\nfavoured regions for the full development of the human powers, whether\r\nphysical or moral, especially of the principle of sympathy, that\r\nvicegerent of the divine benevolence in our world, which is capable of\r\nbinding up all the wounds that sin and death have introduced into it.\r\n\r\nAs we are all, however, too much swayed by the considerations of\r\npleasure and pain, it is probable, that had I been cast into regions\r\nsubject to a rigorous winter, I should have been more anxious to have\r\nescaped from the forest.  Perpetual summer, however, beguiled me from\r\nmy resolution, and being unprovided with a defence against ease and\r\nindolence, years passed on while I was only dreaming of home and\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe hand of Providence, notwithstanding, continued over me, and in a\r\nmiraculous manner took me from savage life.\r\n\r\nThe sun's departing red rays were shining on the surface of the river,\r\nas Pecoe, myself, and three other youths were hastening in our canoes\r\nto reach home before night should set in, when I heard the stroke of\r\noars, that indicated the approach of a boat's crew.  I have before said\r\nthat an inexplicable feeling came over me whenever I thought that I was\r\nin approximation with those who might be the means of conveying me\r\nagain into civilized life.  On this occasion I was for the moment\r\nparalysed.  Pausing to assure myself of the reality of the sounds, I\r\nheard Pecoe and his companions calling to me to pull towards the\r\nopposite shore, from whence the sounds proceeded, and turning round to\r\nascertain the direction they were pursuing, I caught sight of a\r\nlong-boat, manned with ten sailors, just turning a point of land which\r\nhad hitherto screened them from my view.  The Indians were still\r\ncalling to me, but it was too late.  With the usual celerity of British\r\nsailors, the boat in a few seconds was abreast of my canoe.  The\r\nofficer who commanded the crew pulled my canoe aft, and after\r\nscrutinizing my countenance, ejaculated, \"The boatswain is right--an\r\nEuropean; but not, as he supposed, a runaway convict; it's the wrong\r\nlatitude for that kind of fish;\" continuing, \"Come, young man, step\r\ninto our boat: we are in want of some information with which you may\r\nfurnish us.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Impressed on board an English ship]\r\n\r\nI hesitated, then made some reply in English, when one of the sailors\r\nexclaimed, \"I told Tom that he was a Briton.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad I have met with a countryman,\" resumed the officer, who held\r\nthe canoe fast as he offered his hand to assist me into his own boat;\r\nbut as I still hesitated, he affected to stumble, and in the action\r\ndrew me over the bow of the canoe, which constrained me either to jump\r\ninto the ship's boat or fall into the river.  When seated beside the\r\nlieutenant, I had in some measure recovered from my surprise; I\r\ninquired whether the practice of pressing in the British navy was\r\nrevived.\r\n\r\n\"It is not,\" replied the lieutenant, \"but I shall feel myself justified\r\nin detaining you until I have the particulars of your history, and\r\nlearn especially what brought you into this part of the world.\"\r\n\r\nAll this time the boat was proceeding down the river, and had carried\r\nme out of sight of my Indian friends.  When I informed the officer that\r\nI had been lost when a boy, he replied--\r\n\r\n\"Then you are now found; but have you a knowledge of this river?\"\r\n\r\n\"From hence upwards I have,\" said I.  \"having accompanied the Indians\r\nin their farthest migrations.\"\r\n\r\n\"Make your mind easy,\" rejoined the officer, \"I shall introduce you to\r\nthe captain of our brig.\"\r\n\r\nIt appeared that the boat had been sent out by a government brig which\r\nwas on a survey in the river Amazon, to ascertain the course of one of\r\nits tributaries.  Late in the evening of the following day we reached\r\nthe ship, and when my story had been heard by the captain, he at once\r\ndetermined on taking me with him, saying that he should find means of\r\nsending me to Berbice, the point, he judged, from which my father had\r\nstarted, and to which place he thought it probable my father would in\r\nthe first instance transmit an account of my having been lost; and\r\nwhere also it was likely some arrangement had been made for providing\r\nme with the means of finding my way to his residence.\r\n\r\nThe brig remained two months on the survey, and then sailed for\r\nHalifax, crossing the Mexican bay, where I had an opportunity of\r\nwitnessing the extraordinary phenomena produced by a large body of fish\r\nthat at one time surrounded the vessel.  The sea was like one field of\r\nfireworks, all sparkling with serpents and silver spangles; the mind,\r\nwhen contemplating such scenes, is lost in amazement at the prodigious\r\nnumber of living things the regions of the sea contain.  But whether\r\nthe naturalist turns to the woods and the water, or explores the\r\ncloud-capt mountains, the sequestered cave, or the rocky cliffs, he\r\nwill at first be embarrassed at the sight of the variety of objects\r\nthat claim his attention; and it is only by learning how to distinguish\r\nthem in a methodical manner that the mind can be brought to contemplate\r\nthem in detail.\r\n\r\nOn board the vessel I was supplied with a sailor's dress, but the force\r\nof habit was so strong that for a considerable time I could not wear it\r\nwith any comfort to myself.  The captain was faithful to his promise,\r\nand from Halifax sent me in a merchant vessel to Demerara, with a\r\nletter addressed to the British consul at that station.  On my arrival\r\nI presented myself before that authority, who the next day produced a\r\ncolonial newspaper in which I had seven years previously been\r\nadvertised, and a reward offered for my recovery, and in which also the\r\nname of an agent was mentioned who would defray any costs incurred on\r\nthe occasion.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Return to society]\r\n\r\nFortunately that gentleman was still in the colony, who, after\r\nsatisfying himself of my identity, promised to avail himself of the\r\nearliest opportunity to restore me to my family.  The location of my\r\nfather's property was on the remote banks of a branch of the Amazon\r\nriver, to which few vessels traded, there was therefore no possibility\r\nof reaching it otherwise than overland, as the family had previously\r\ndone.  For some time after my arrival in Demerara, I found myself an\r\nobject of interest, receiving invitations from most of the respectable\r\ninhabitants; while my appearance in the streets excited a sensation.\r\nAlthough I was much pleased with the opportunity of attending public\r\nworship, where I might collect and concentrate the scattered ideas I\r\nretained of my father's faith, yet the ceremonies and forms of society\r\nappeared ridiculous to me, and were very irksome.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: First sight of home]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The brother and sister]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Rengal]\r\n\r\nI received marked attention and kindness from the gentleman who had\r\nbeen advertised as my father's agent, and an opportunity soon occurred\r\nfor him to place me under safe escort to my home.  Two gentlemen were\r\nabout to journey near to where my father resided, and they kindly\r\nundertook my safe conveyance.  They were entrusted with a letter from\r\nthe agent to my father, which was to be delivered into no other hands\r\nbut his own.  I can scarcely describe my delight when all was in\r\nreadiness for our departure and we set out on our journey.  My feelings\r\nof impatience grew more uncontrollable every day.  The thoughts of home\r\nand the prospect of again beholding all I held dear on earth made my\r\npassage appear a lifetime;--tedious and protracted as it was I shall\r\npass it over now, as it had no incident that was at all attractive to\r\nme--until we arrived at the Amazon River, whose clear surface I hailed\r\nwith indescribable delight, as I knew then we were not far from my\r\nfather's estate.  Following its course for a day we arrived towards the\r\nafternoon at a plantation of cotton, the proprietor of which informed\r\nme that we were within two miles of my father's house.  He had heard\r\nthe particulars of my absence, but declined to comply with my request\r\nto go and inform the family of my arrival.  The reason he assigned was\r\nthat he had lately been engaged in a dispute with my father, and\r\ntherefore could not undertake my mission--adding that the alteration in\r\nmy appearance, living as I had from the age of thirteen to twenty in\r\nthe wilderness, would be sufficient to prevent them from recognising me\r\nat first.  I then inquired for my uncles, and was informed that one had\r\nsold his land and returned to England, and that the other (the widower)\r\nwas dead.  This unchristian man also informed me that, in his opinion,\r\nI had been given up as entirely lost by my family.  As the day was\r\nadvancing, I waited no longer to hold converse with him, but abruptly\r\nturned away, disgusted with his apathy and want of feeling.  As we\r\nproceeded towards my home, I consulted with the two gentlemen who were\r\nmy guides what course to adopt in breaking the intelligence of my\r\nreturn, to my family, as I felt a dread of presenting myself too\r\nprecipitately after so long an absence, being naturally fearful that\r\nthe shock would be more than my mother could sustain.  We deemed it\r\nprudent, therefore, to send the letter by one of my guides, while I\r\nwaited the result close by.  Our precautions, however, were not carried\r\ninto effect, as an incident occurred which rendered them unnecessary.\r\nI had arrived in sight of my father's habitation, and paused on a\r\nslight eminence to contemplate with mingled feelings of surprise,\r\ndelight, and fear, the spot made sacred by the affections which were\r\ncentred there, with all the ties which bound me to the world--that spot\r\nwhich, from the meanest to the noblest in every land, is the only haven\r\nof refuge from the troubles and travail in this life, and which finds a\r\nready response in every heart by the one magic word--home!  I had not\r\nfelt its cheering influence for now more than six years.  An outcast\r\nand a wanderer for that period, how often in the loneliness of my\r\nforest life had I yearned to be again restored to it, and to find, like\r\nthe dove of old, a place of refuge and rest--an ark, and a covenant.\r\nBut now, as the fruition of my hopes appeared to be realized, I paused,\r\nspell-bound and overpowered by the many conflicting feelings which the\r\nsight of it had conjured up.  The memory of all the incidents of my\r\nearly life--the days of childhood--the school-boy troubles--the many\r\nacts of parental kindness evinced in a thousand ways--were all pictured\r\nto my sight in one rapid glance.  And then the terrible foreboding\r\npresented itself, that I might not find my family circle as I had left\r\nthem--alive and in health.  In the history of the world six years is\r\nbut a speck of time; but with individuals the case is widely different.\r\nI had lost one uncle, and the fear came across me that my loss might\r\nnot be ended thus.  I almost dreaded to make the inquiry, as I felt\r\nincapable of bearing such a calamity.  It was a beautiful mansion which\r\nlay before me.  The large and well-built house, surrounded with thick\r\nfoliage--the carefully cultivated grounds surrounding it--the broad and\r\nextensive landscape beyond of richly wooded hill and dale--the wide and\r\nmeandering river by whose banks I had been guided thither--gave to the\r\nscene a lofty grandeur.  While standing thus irresolute, a young man of\r\nsome five or six and twenty was advancing towards us; he had on his arm\r\na female, with whom he appeared to be chatting familiarly.  I watched\r\nthem as they came near us, and from the young man's appearance judged\r\nhim to be one of the settlers here.  As they approached, I heard their\r\nvoices more distinctly.  That of the female fell upon my ear in well\r\nremembered tones.  There could be no mistaking them, I knew it to be\r\nthe voice of my sister.  But ah! how changed she was.  The laughing\r\nmerry girl had grown into a staid and matronly woman.  I could hardly\r\nbelieve it possible; but to assure myself, I inquired of her companion\r\nif that was the residence of Mr. Howard.  My sister started as I spoke,\r\nturned pale, and looked at me intently.  I suppose I was changed;\r\nindeed, there was but little doubt of that--but changed as I was, she\r\ncould not be deceived.  She trembled, and would have fallen, had I not\r\ncaught her in my arms in a fond embrace.  The first surprise over, she\r\nlaughed and cried by turns, and overwhelmed me with caresses.  Then the\r\nnumberless inquiries she had to make!  One after the other in such\r\nrapid succession, without waiting for replies.  I know not what the\r\nthree spectators of the scene must have thought; but no doubt they\r\ndeemed her frantic, and, indeed, for the time, I believe she was.  My\r\nfirst inquiry was about my parents.  They were both well.  She had left\r\nthem a few minutes previously.  Her companion she introduced to me as\r\nher husband.  She told me, also, that she had two children, a little\r\nboy and girl.  We arranged our plan, if it could be called arrangement,\r\nwhere all was mad delight; she insisted that my two guides should go\r\nhome with her husband for that evening, as his house was close by, and\r\ndeliver the letter in the morning, while she and myself went home to\r\nour parents.  When we had arrived at the house, I detained her from\r\nentering until I had peeped in at the window to take a glance at its\r\ninmates.  There was a light in the interior, and I could observe all\r\ndistinctly.  I saw my father seated in a comfortable apartment, quite\r\nunconscious of any one observing them.  My father was reading aloud one\r\nof the local papers.  He wore spectacles; I remember to have been\r\nstruck with this, otherwise, my mother and he were not at all changed.\r\nThe same as I had left them--the old familiar faces, remembered from\r\nearliest childhood--the old familiar faces, it made a child of me again\r\nto gaze on them.  Presently my sister entered, and from her hurried\r\nmanner and sudden return, they seemed surprised.  She said something, I\r\ndid not know what, but my father rose, and hastily throwing down the\r\npaper, gazed wonderingly on my sister.  I waited no longer--another\r\nmoment--I was on my knees before my mother, buried in her embrace.  She\r\nwept over me, her truant boy, tears of joy.  Who of us has not felt the\r\ndepth and purity of a mother's love?  Who hath not found, be his errors\r\nwhat they might, that there was one gentle spirit to turn to, ever\r\nready to pardon, protect, and solace?  I felt the force of this doubly\r\nthen.  And now, when past the meridian of my life, I look back through\r\nthe long vista of the past, the self-devotedness of a mother's love\r\nshines forth as something \"which lighted up my way of life,\" never to\r\nbe forgotten.  My father could scarcely find utterance, from excess of\r\njoy at my return.  I recounted to him a brief summary of all I had gone\r\nthrough since I had been lost, and half that night was passed in the\r\ndetails of my story.  My sister did not return to her own home till the\r\nfollowing morning, when I accompanied her.  Another surprise awaited\r\nme.  I saw Rengal and his father working on our estate.  They had\r\nbecome devoted and trustworthy servants of the family, being employed\r\nas free labourers.  It seemed that my father had instituted a vigorous\r\nsearch for me, and had engaged them many months for that purpose,\r\nbelieving their acquaintance with the country would be of infinite\r\nservice in the undertaking.  Their labours, however, proved fruitless,\r\nas my reader already knows.  Ultimately, pleased with their faithful\r\nconduct, and evident anxiety to accomplish my restoration, he engaged\r\nthem as assistants on his farm, where they had remained ever since.\r\nTheir surprise and extravagant delight when I made myself known,\r\nexceeded all bounds; and although, perhaps, I compromised my dignity, I\r\nwas obliged, in spite of myself, to burst out into a fit of immoderate\r\nlaughter.  There was a degree of comicality about these people which\r\nwas perfectly irresistible, the more so, as they could not at all\r\ncomprehend it themselves.  The old negro informed me that he had\r\ndiscovered his daughter, and my sister's husband had purchased her\r\nfreedom, and engaged her as a domestic in his house.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nMany years have rolled on since the incidents described in this\r\nnarrative occurred.  Time has been busy with his ceaseless works and\r\nwondrous changes.  Our little settlement has now sprung up into a large\r\nand thriving city, in whose streets are seen a throng of busy men.  Our\r\nriver bears upon its bosom many argosies freighted with the merchandise\r\nof every clime.  Our meadows are ploughed into furrows by the hand of\r\nthe skilful husbandman, and returning autumn sees them laden with the\r\nproducts of cultivated nature.  The giant, steam, is made a slave to\r\nman.  and is seen at work on the mill--the mine--the forge--and rail;\r\nand everywhere marks of the master spirit, industry, are visible in our\r\ntown.  For myself, I am rich in the possession of all the blessings of\r\ndomestic life, with an amiable and loving partner and dutiful children.\r\nI am respected as a thriving merchant, and I hope as a worthy friend.\r\nMy parents, I am happy to say, still cheer me with their presence and\r\nadvice; and if this, the narrative of my earlier years, should awaken\r\nthe youthful mind to a sense of self-reliance and dependence under all\r\ntrials and vicissitudes, and make manifest the bounteous providence of\r\na wise and beneficent Creator, my labours will not have been spent in\r\nvain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Transcriber's note: In this etext, the source book's variant page\r\nheadings have been converted to sidenotes and positioned where most\r\nlogical.]",
