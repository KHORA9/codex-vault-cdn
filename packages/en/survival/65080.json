A. with whom I was boarded,\r\nof the Vice Provost, and other functionaries, I had, unfortunately\r\nand unwisely, spent too much of my time with the boxing gloves and\r\nfencing foils; at cricket in the playing fields; in rowing on the\r\nriver--that old traditional amusement of our Etonians; in training\r\nfor the great 4th of June, the College Regatta day; and in erratic\r\nexcursions to Windsor and elsewhere--to hope for transference to\r\nCambridge.\r\n\r\nThis had long been the dearest wish of my father, poor man! but in\r\nhis letters to me the names of Walpole, Canning, Fox, Wellington,\r\nHallam, and other _alumni_ of our great seminary, were rehearsed\r\nagain and again without effect; and he never failed to remind me, in\r\nthe words of old Lembarde, that it is always to Cambridge \"the scole\r\nof Eton sendeth her ripe fruite.\"\r\n\r\nI had earned the unpleasant reputation of being an idler, though by\r\nno means one; and this was oddly enough confirmed, when one day I\r\nnarrowly escaped drowning in the same pool, if not among the same\r\nweeds, where George, Earl Waldegrave, an Eton boy in his tenth year,\r\nperished so long ago as 1794, when bathing in the Thames, near a\r\nfield called the Brocas.\r\n\r\n\"Existence,\" says a certain writer, \"appears to me scarcely\r\nexistence, without its struggles and its successes.  I should ever\r\nlike to have some great end before me, for the striving to attain\r\namid a crowd of competitors, would make me feel all the glory of\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\nWith such vague ideas floating before me, I returned from Eton _last\r\nyear_, and found myself at my father's house, the old and secluded\r\nRectory of Erlesmere, in a very undecided frame of mind as to the\r\nfuture, and the profession I should adopt.\r\n\r\nMy father, as before, urged King's College as a proper preparation\r\nfor any profession.\r\n\r\nMy mother hinted that our name had shone in the navy, and cast a\r\nglance at a large portrait which hung in the dining-room.  It\r\nrepresented George Lord Rodney, the castigator of the Spaniards, in a\r\nfull bob-wig and white satin breeches, boarding the leading ship of\r\nthe Caracca fleet, amid a whirlwind of torn rigging, smoke, and\r\ncannon-balls, forming a background by no means hilarious.\r\n\r\nBut my father pooh-poohed this.  I was already far too old for the\r\ntime at which the navy is entered--to wit, the mature years of\r\nthirteen.\r\n\r\nThen my aunt Etty, who still curled her hair in the fashion of thirty\r\nyears ago, recommended the army with a pensive air; for she had been\r\nengaged to a young sub, who was killed at--I must not say _where_,\r\nfor it was a great many years ago, and Aunt Etty is unmarried still;\r\nbut her views, though warmly seconded by sisters Dot and Sybil (who\r\nsaw military balls and pic-nics in perspective), did not accord with\r\nmine, for I had spent two years or more in our Eton rifle corps, and\r\nthe monotony of the drill--especially that boring _curriculum_ of\r\nHythe position (I went through the musketry class), worried me, as I\r\nwilfully deemed myself able to sight my weapon and bring down either\r\na Frenchman or a pheasant without it.\r\n\r\nAt Aunt Etty's suggestion, my father would shake his white head, and\r\nsay, quoting the author of Ecclesiasticus,--\r\n\r\n\"'There are two things which grieve my heart to see: a man of war\r\nthat suffereth from poverty, and men of understanding that are not\r\nset by.'  The sword, Etty, is but a poor inheritance; better send\r\nDick to the counting-house of his uncle, Rodney and Co., in London.\"\r\n\r\nBut I trembled at this suggestion, as it did not accord with my own\r\nbrilliant views in any way and so months passed idly away.\r\n\r\nI missed the manly amusements of Eton, and the hilarity of my\r\nclass-fellows; and though loving well my home and family, when the\r\nnovelty of my return and of perfect freedom passed away, I longed for\r\na change of scene--a stirring occupation--an active employment.\r\n\r\nIs destiny stronger than intention?\r\n\r\nI should hope not; yet for a time I was almost inclined to think so,\r\nafter the terrible episode by which I was suddenly torn from my home,\r\nand cast upon that world which, hitherto, I had viewed through the\r\nsunny medium of my day-dreams and romances alone.\r\n\r\nOur Rectory is situated a mile distant from the sea, of which an\r\nample view can be had from the upper windows.  Behind the house grows\r\na coppice of mighty oaks, the gnarled arms of which bear loads of\r\nrustling foliage that form long leafy dells, through which the sun\r\ncan scarcely penetrate in summer,--trees so old that the mind becomes\r\nlost in attempting to conceive what was there before they grew, or\r\n_who_ planted them, and of all that has passed in the changing world,\r\nof all that have been born, have lived long lives, died, and been\r\nlaid in their silent graves, since these old oaks were acorns, twigs,\r\nand saplings!\r\n\r\nThe Rectory of Erlesmere is an antique mansion, with projecting oriel\r\nwindows, the mullions of which are almost hidden by ivy, woodbine,\r\nand honeysuckle.  One portion terminates in a steep dove-cot gable,\r\nthe other in a kind of tower, wherein, says tradition, an old rector\r\nof former times defended himself against the puritans, and valiantly\r\nblazed away with a matchlock through some narrow slits, in which the\r\nmartins now built their nests in peace, and over which the China\r\nroses grew undisturbed; while against the strong old wall my sisters\r\nSybil and Dot had their fernery, to them an object of great\r\nsolicitude and interest, as they were very learned in the science of\r\nall manner of leaves, blades, and twigs, and knew their mysterious\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nClose by is our old Rectory church, with its brass-mounted tombs of\r\nthe Middle Ages, and its black oak pews of the Puritan times, where\r\nevery Sunday and holiday the rays of light fell through the painted\r\nwindows on the bowed heads of the country people while my father\r\npreached.\r\n\r\nBeyond the house and church stretches a fair green English lawn,\r\nwhereon a herd of deer are grazing, with the summer sunshine falling\r\non their smooth dapple coats as they toss their antlers; and, when\r\nscared by the whistle of the distant railway train, they glide away\r\nto the oak coppice, that is older than the days of the Tudors or\r\nStuarts.\r\n\r\nThat coppice and the sea-shore, but especially the latter, were my\r\nfavorite resorts.  Daily I wandered by the beach, listening to the\r\nsurge that chafed upon the layers of pebbles, shells, and seaweed,\r\nthinking of Danish Canute and his servile courtiers, or filled by\r\nthose vague, solemn, and pleasing thoughts, which the sight of an\r\nobject so mighty and mysterious as the boundless ocean creates within\r\nus.\r\n\r\nThe monotonous sound of wave after wave, as they broke on the flat\r\nbeach, made me think of lands and shores, of people, cities, and\r\nadventures far, far away from our quiet old ivy-clad Rectory and its\r\ndaily routine.  Thus, every piece of drift wood, every strange\r\nfishbone and mouldered piece of timber which the ocean cast at my\r\nfeet, became a source of interest for the mind to ruminate upon.\r\n\r\nI remember the masts of a sunken vessel being discovered one morning,\r\nabout two miles from the shore, and they were long a source of\r\nspeculation to me.  A mystery hovered about these rotting spars,\r\nthese slimy ropes that waved in the sea breeze, and the hull that lay\r\namid the rocks and weeds so far down below.\r\n\r\nWhat was her story, what the fate of her crew, none could guess, as\r\nno bodies ever came ashore with the tide.\r\n\r\nWhen a ship appeared at the horizon, my eye followed her until her\r\nsails melted into the distant haze, and then it seemed as if spirit\r\nand fancy pursued her together upon the world of waters.\r\n\r\nGenerally we saw only coasters creeping along, or colliers bound for\r\nthe Thames, with their dingy canvas, their black sides, and\r\nencumbered decks; but more than once we were favored by seeing a\r\nBritish line-of-battle ship in all her glory--one of the channel\r\nsquadron, no doubt--with her squared yards, her flush decks, her\r\nsnow-white hummocks in the nettings--the ports triced up, and the\r\ntriple tier of sixty-eights or thirty-twos peering through them; the\r\nscarlet ensign floating at her gaff peak; the officers lounging on\r\nthe poop, the red-coated marines at their posts; and high over all,\r\nthe long whip-like pennant streaming on the air, from the mainmast\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nSuch a sight, under a splendid sunshine, when the summer sea was only\r\nrippled by a gentle breeze, to catch which every inch of canvas was\r\nspread to the yard-heads, might make the coldest heart quicken; and\r\nit certainly made me think of my mother's wishes, and of old Rodney\r\nin his bob-wig and ruffles, scrambling at the head of his boarders,\r\nsword in hand, up the carved and gilded side of the Spanish\r\ngalleon--of Boscawen and Benbow, Captain Cook, and Robinson Crusoe;\r\nfor the real and the ideal were all blended together in my wayward\r\nmind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN ZEERVOGEL.\r\n\r\nTwo miles from the Rectory is the village or small seaport of\r\nErlesmere.\r\n\r\nIt is a sunshiny little place, having a row of fishermen's houses,\r\nthat are covered by woodbine and honeysuckle, amid which, and over\r\nwhich, are quantities of brown nets and black bladders, drying in the\r\nbreeze.\r\n\r\nGarlands of red-floats are tossed upon the same breeze, as they are\r\nstrung in lines across the little street; and others, that are\r\npainted yellow, nestle, like great pumpkins, amid the luxuriant\r\nmasses of leaves which cover the picturesque little dwellings.  Boats\r\nof all sizes and rusty anchors encumber the little street, which is\r\npaved with round stones; while oars, spare yards, and masts stand\r\nagainst the walls and eaves in all directions.\r\n\r\nSwarms of red-cheeked children gambol amid this nautical _débris_;\r\nand they bring such quantities of shells and pebbles from the\r\nsea-beach that there are as many in the street as on the shore.\r\n\r\nOne of the leading features in the fisher-village of Erlesmere is a\r\nlittle public house, at the ivy-covered porch of which a group of\r\nburly weather-beaten fellows in long boots, striped shirts, and red\r\nnightcaps, and constantly smoking, drinking, and \"taking squints to\r\nseaward\" through an old battered telescope, \"served\" round with\r\nspun-yarn.  Near it is a small dock-yard, where their boats are\r\nbuilt, tarred, and painted, and where a passing coaster may have a\r\ntrivial repair effected, and occasionally be hove down.\r\n\r\nThis dock is inclosed by a low ruinous wall, but, of course, is open\r\ntoward the sea.  It is full of well-seasoned logs, queer odds and\r\nends of trees--it is redolent of tar and bilge, and is knee-deep in\r\nchips and shavings.  Its only ornament is a flag-staff, whereon an\r\nold union jack is displayed on national holidays; for we are very\r\nloyal people in Erlesmere, no penny newspaper having ever found its\r\nway there to create disunion among us.  We have no traditions that go\r\nbeyond the days of Nelson, Howe, and Duncan; and one old fellow, the\r\npatriarch of the village, remembers well that sunny morning in the\r\nlast days of 1805, when a great squadron was seen standing slowly\r\nup-channel, with all their ensigns half hoisted, for the hero of\r\nTrafalgar lay dead in the cabin of the _Victory_!\r\n\r\nIt happened, only _last year_, that a small Dutch schooner of some\r\nfifty tons was laid down on the gridiron at Erlesmere dock, for the\r\npurpose of being repaired.  This was an event of some importance, and\r\nthe whole nautical population cheerfully lent a hand in unloading\r\nher, and securing the cargo, which consisted of apples and Tergou\r\ncheeses; while her skipper, Captain Zeervogel, and the six men who\r\ncomposed his crew, became for the time the lions and oracles of the\r\nsmoking-room and porch of the ivy-covered tavern, where it was\r\ntacitly agreed that nothing should be said about Lord Duncan, or \"the\r\nlicking he gave these Dutch lubbers off the Texel,\" in our\r\ngrandfathers' days.\r\n\r\nI had never seen a Dutch craft before; thus the quaint aspect of this\r\nschooner, with her deep waist, her bow and stern which were so clumsy\r\nin their form and strength, so exactly alike, and tilted up till she\r\nresembled a cheese cut in half--her leeboards, her brown oak planks,\r\nall bright with varnish, and her little cabin windows encircled by\r\nalternate stripes of red, green, and white paint, all made her, to\r\nme, a source of wonder; and I was daily on board, having obtained a\r\nfree entry, after the bestowal of some schnaps (_i.e._, gin and\r\nwater) upon the captain, Jan van Zeervogel, who told me many a\r\nstrange tale of the North Sea, for he was a pleasant and\r\ncommunicative old fellow, having, as he told me, a wife and children,\r\nwho kept his farm on the isle of Wolfersdyck, near South Beveland,\r\nwhile he tempted the dangers of the ocean to dispose of its\r\nagricultural produce.\r\n\r\nOne night, while the schooner was still on the gridiron, but when her\r\nrepairs were nearly completed, I was with him in the little dungeon\r\nwhich he called his cabin; darkness had set in, and the hour was\r\nlate--later than I ought to have been aboard--for we kept early hours\r\nat the Rectory; but the novelty of the situation, the old Dutchman's\r\nstories, the fumes of his meerschaum, and the effect of some peaches,\r\nwhich he gave me from a large gallipot, wherein his wife had\r\npreserved them in brandy, rendered me careless as to how the time\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n\"So, Captain Zeervogel,\" said I, \"you are a farmer as well as a\r\nmariner?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a schiffer as well as a boor, a plougher alike of the land and\r\nsea,\" he replied, in good English.  \"I have a farm\" (he pronounced it\r\n_varrm_, and so on, using consonants in a mode with which I shall not\r\nafflict the reader), \"at Wolfersdyck, which is one of the most\r\npleasant of the Zealand isles, and is about six miles long.  It was\r\nlarger once, but when the dykes broke, the sea swallowed up a great\r\nportion of it.  About three hundred years ago the sea burst over all\r\nBeveland, and for many a year nothing of it was visible above the\r\nwater, but the vanes and tops of the church steeples, with the\r\nsea-gulls and petrels perching on them.* So, you see, master, as soon\r\nas we come to anchor in the Zuid-vliet, and have our fore and aft\r\ncanvas in the brails, my horses come from their stables, we run a\r\nhawser ahead, and thereby they tow the schooner through a little\r\ncanal right into my own farm-yard, where my wife, my children, my\r\nhouse-dog--even the pigs, cocks and hens await and welcome us.  There\r\nwe load her, and victual the crew forward and the cabin aft, with the\r\nproduce of my own land.  My brother, who kept the Schiffer Huys on\r\nthe shore of the Zuid-vliet, used to manage all that for me.  But\r\ngood Adrian is gone now--he died under strange and terrible\r\ncircumstances, heaven rest him!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n* This was in 1532.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe usually jolly Dutch captain emitted a sigh and a mighty puff of\r\nsmoke together.  He applied once more to a square-case bottle of\r\nschiedam, and then became silent--even sad.\r\n\r\n\"Strange circumstances?\" said I, echoing his words; \"may I inquire\r\nwhat they were?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh, myn brooder!  I almost shudder when I think of them!\"\r\n\r\nMy curiosity was naturally excited, and I added--\r\n\r\n\"Was he drowned?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no--worse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Killed?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say; he died by my hand on that cabin floor; and yet he did\r\nnot, for he perished of a marsh fever ashore.\"\r\n\r\nI thought that the brain of Captain Jan Van Zeervogel was disordered,\r\nor at least was becoming affected by the contents of his bottle of\r\nschiedam; but he resumed:\r\n\r\n\"Though I am not one who is much used to looking astern in the voyage\r\nof life, or back through the mists of time and memory, I will tell\r\nyou this strange story, Mr. Rodney, as it happened to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain carefully refilled the brown bowl of his large pipe, lit\r\nit with equal deliberation, and after a few whiffs, during which his\r\nkeen, gray eyes were bent on the cabin floor, he fixed them on the\r\nrudder case, and then commenced his tale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE THREE WARNINGS.\r\n\r\n\"I must preface my story by telling you that my brother Adrian and I\r\nwere twins, and possessed to the full that mysterious affinity and\r\naffection which are said to exist between those who are born thus.\r\nWhen Adrian's arm was broken by the sail of a windmill, I was\r\ncruising off the coast of Mexico, yet I was sensible of a shock and\r\nof a benumbed feeling in my right elbow which puzzled the doctors for\r\nmany days; yet it passed away as Adrian's hurt became well, and until\r\nmy return home I knew not what had affected me.\r\n\r\n\"It happened also that when I was nearly drowned by falling from the\r\nforetopsail yard, in a dark night during a gale in the Pentland\r\nFirth, Adrian was almost choked in his sleep through dreaming that\r\nthe dykes had broken, and that the waves were suffocating him.  I\r\nmerely mention these two instances out of many that occurred, to\r\nillustrate what I mean.\r\n\r\n\"Our brotherly love for each other was strong; all the stronger,\r\nperhaps, because of this strange mystery, which we could neither\r\naccount for, nor escape from--nor had we the desire to do so.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I had been with this schooner on what we considered an\r\nunusually long voyage--so far as Bristol, with a cargo of my own\r\ngrain, cheese, and apples.  I sold them well, but failed to get a\r\nreturn freight; and after being damaged in a gale, which forced us to\r\nrun under a jury foremast into Havre de Grace for repairs, we bore up\r\nfor home, and after a six months' absence came to anchor, in a dark\r\nnight, when the wind was blowing fresh, in the Zuid-vliet.\r\n\r\n\"We were close in shore--so close that I could see over the level\r\nland the light that burned in my own comfortable kitchen; and long I\r\nremained on deck looking at it, for I knew that my dear wife and all\r\nour little ones were there, and that in the corner of the deep-arched\r\nfireplace my brother Adrian would be smoking his long pipe, and\r\ngiving our youngest boy, little Jan, a ride on his foot.\r\n\r\n\"They would be talking of me--of the schooner and her crew, who were\r\nall neighbors,--little thinking we were so near them, and that our\r\nanchor had fast hold of the soil of Wolfersdyck.\r\n\r\n\"My heart yearned to join them; but the hour was late, the night was\r\ndark, and there was a heavy sea rolling round the point of North\r\nBeveland and meeting the East Scheldt, so there was such a swell,\r\nthat every time the schooner's head was lifted, I thought the chain\r\ncable would part, or we would drag our anchor.\r\n\r\n\"I abandoned all intention of going ashore for that night.  I smoked\r\na pipe, took a glass of schiedam, saw all made snug aloft and on\r\ndeck, and read a chapter of the Bible to my crew.  We returned thanks\r\nto Him who holds the great deep in the hollow of his hand, for\r\nbringing us safely home--for we are pious in our own quiet way, we\r\nDutch folks--and then, save the watch, we all turned in for the night.\r\n\r\n\"I had been asleep in the larboard berth, _there_, for about an hour,\r\nwhen I awoke suddenly with an undefinable sensation of terror, and\r\nthe conviction that some one was in the cabin near me.\r\n\r\n\"'Who is there?' I called aloud; but receiving no answer, and hearing\r\nonly the creaking of the ship's timbers as she strained on the chain\r\ncable, and the gurgle of the sea alongside, I dropped asleep, but\r\nonly to wake again with a start, a shiver, and the same conviction\r\nthat some one was near me!\r\n\r\n\"Drawing back that little curtain on the brass rod, I looked out.\r\n\r\n\"Through the two little stern windows the moon was shining, but with\r\nsudden gleams of weird, wan light, as the schooner rose and sunk on\r\nthe long rollers of the heavy ground swell.  The cabin lamp swung to\r\nand fro in the skylight, thus I could see plainly enough the figure\r\nof a man clad like a Dutch peasant, standing near the table at which\r\nwe are now seated, but I could not discern his features, as his back\r\nwas toward me.\r\n\r\n\"My first thought was of thieves, and that some schelms from the\r\nshore had ventured on board, and overpowered the anchor watch.\r\n\r\n\"Snatching a cutlass from the cleat at the bulkhead, I sprang out of\r\nbed; but at that moment the figure disappeared like a shadow!\r\n\r\n\"Surprised and disordered by this incident, I hastened on deck.  All\r\nwas still on board.  The fore and aft canvas was tight in its brails;\r\nthe chain-cable was taut as the schooner's head lay to the slow, deep\r\ncurrent of the Scheldt; the watch were walking to and fro; the wind\r\nwas yet blowing freshly, and the moon was on the wane behind the\r\nslender spires, the great windmills, and the flat, dark shore of\r\nBeveland; but I could see at Wolfersdyck the ruddy light that still\r\nshone from the window of my own farm-kitchen.\r\n\r\n\"At such a time this seemed strange.  Why were they not all a-bed?\r\n\r\n\"I looked at my watch.  The hour was eleven; so, believing that the\r\nfigure I had seen was merely the effect of fancy, I descended to the\r\ncabin, once more turned in, and fell asleep, the more readily that I\r\nhad sniffed the night breeze which came from the land and sea\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\"But I could not have been sleeping more than ten minutes when I\r\nawoke with a nervous start, and with the same undefinable sensation\r\nof terror.  Again I looked into the cabin, and there, in the\r\nmoonlight, stood the same man, or figure of a man, near the table!\r\n\r\n\"Anger now replaced my first emotion of alarm; and starting from bed,\r\nI hurled an iron marlin spike at the person, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"'Take _that_, whoever you are!'\r\n\r\n\"The man seemed to fall just as the light in the cabin lamp sank low.\r\nI rushed toward him, and then, as his prostrate form turned slowly\r\nround, the dim light of the waning moon fell steadily through the\r\ncabin window on his face; and oh, what saw I then?\r\n\r\n\"The features of Adrian--of my brother--but pale, ghastly, pinched,\r\nand damp with the dews of death; his eyes glazing with a terrible\r\nexpression of combined affection and _reproach_, as they met mine,\r\nand then the whole seemed to melt away; the lamp went out, and the\r\nmoonlight passed away too, as the schooner's stern fell round with\r\nthe _ebb_ tide--the usual time of death.\r\n\r\n\"I was alone--alone in the dark cabin--with terror in my heart, and a\r\ncold perspiration on my brow.\r\n\r\n\"I rushed on deck.  The light _still_ burned in the kitchen window,\r\nbut to me it seemed brighter than before.\r\n\r\n\"'Lower the boat,' I exclaimed, 'for I must instantly go ashore.\r\nThere is something wrong at home, lads.'\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately the sea and wind had gone down together, and we might\r\nventure to land safely now; thus the boat with two men in her, was\r\nready almost before I was dressed.\r\n\r\n\"I was soon ashore, and hastened to my own house, where, as none knew\r\nwe were at anchor in the Zuid-vliet, my arrival was quite unexpected.\r\n\r\n\"I found my household astir--the rooms all lighted up as for a\r\nfestival; but, alas, what a festival it was!  My wife threw herself\r\ninto my arms, and wept, and our red-cheeked little ones clung about\r\nme in their night dresses, as I was led to the room of my good\r\nbrother Adrian, who was then in his death agony.\r\n\r\n\"'Adrian,' I exclaimed, throwing myself on my knees at his bedside,\r\n'tell me how fares it with you?'*\r\n\r\n\r\n* This story is nearly similar to one which a friend related to me as\r\nhaving occurred in his own family not long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"He turned his ghastly face toward me with the same expression of\r\naffection and reproach, which I had seen in the face of the vision in\r\nmy cabin, and at that moment his last breath passed away; the jaw\r\nfell, his head turned on one side, and a mortal pallor spread over\r\nhis features.\r\n\r\n\"How such things come to pass I can no more say than where a\r\nhurricane begins, or where it _ends_; I relate but the events as they\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\n\"My brother was dead, and I became stupefied!\r\n\r\n\"I was afterwards told that a fatal fever had seized him, and that he\r\nhad been given over by the doctor to the grim king at the very time\r\nwe had come to anchor in the Zuid-vliet.  On a further comparison of\r\nnotes, we found that he had fallen into a trance at _each_ time I had\r\nbeen awakened in my cabin; and that at the moment I had thrown the\r\nmarlinspike (you may see the mark of it there on the cabin floor), he\r\nhad uttered my name with a cry of agony; but Heaven rest him,\" added\r\nthe captain, once more filling the bowl of his meerschaum, \"he lies\r\nat rest now in the old burying-ground of Smouts Kerk.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after Captain Zeervogel concluded his narrative, I proposed to\r\nleave the schooner and return home; but he said, that as he intended\r\nto sleep that night on board, and as the crew were all ashore, he\r\nbegged that I would have the kindness to remain in the cabin for a\r\nfew minutes until he returned from the little tavern where they were\r\nlocated, as he had some orders to give.\r\n\r\n\"The tide will rise higher to-night than usual,\" he added.  \"I must\r\nhave the schooner made more secure by additional warps, else there is\r\nno knowing what may happen.\"\r\n\r\nI could not in courtesy refuse, though in no way disposed to remain\r\nin that gloomy little cabin, after the ghostly narrative I had just\r\nheard; but he trimmed the lamp anew, as if to make the place more\r\ncheery, and, without waiting for an answer, went on deck.  I heard\r\nhim descend the side-ladder; and, as he passed away, stumbling among\r\nthe logs and chips of the little dockyard, I had the unpleasant\r\nconviction of being alone--alone in the confined scene of his wild\r\nstory.\r\n\r\nMy watch told me it was now the time for supper and prayers at the\r\nRectory, from which I had been too long absent.  Then a vague emotion\r\nof alarm came over me, as I expected every instant to hear some\r\nunaccountable sound, or to see something that might terrify me; so,\r\nto gather \"Dutch courage,\" I very unwisely took one or two more of\r\nCaptain Zeervogel's peaches, which, as already stated, were preserved\r\nin brandy, and consequently were more potent in effect than the\r\nspirit itself.\r\n\r\nDearly did I pay the penalty of that act of indiscretion!\r\n\r\nI listened intently, but heard no sound indicative of the captain's\r\nreturn.  Once, there seemed to come a cry from a distance.  My head\r\nbegan to swim and my eyelids to droop.  The fumes of Zeervogel's long\r\npipe, which pervaded and made closer the atmosphere of the little\r\ncabin, together with the effect of the peaches, proved too much for\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI started to reach the companion ladder and ascend on deck; but my\r\nlimbs seemed to become powerless--to yield under me, and I fell into\r\na drowsy doze, with my head and arms on the cabin table.\r\n\r\nThe captain never returned; and long after, I ascertained that the\r\npoor man had been knocked down by some unruly \"navvies,\" that the cry\r\nI heard had been his, that he had been robbed and left senseless in\r\nthe street of the village, while I lay asleep in the cabin of the\r\nempty schooner, with the flood-tide rising rapidly about her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHOW I GOT ADRIFT.\r\n\r\nI had been asleep nearly four hours, when a fall on the cabin floor,\r\nas I slipped from the table, awoke me.\r\n\r\nStiff, cold, and benumbed, I started up, confused to find myself in\r\nthe dark, and at first I knew not _where_.\r\n\r\nI reeled, and fell twice or thrice in efforts to keep my feet for now\r\nthe schooner was rolling from side to side--rolling and afloat!\r\n\r\n\"Home--let me hasten home,\" was my first thought.  I scrambled up the\r\ncompanion ladder and reached the deck, to find water around me on\r\nevery side, while the schooner being without ballast and light as a\r\ncork, lay almost on her beam ends, as she was careened by a heavy\r\nbreeze that blew from the shore, the lights of which, probably\r\nErlesmere, I could see about three miles distant.\r\n\r\nA deadly terror filled my heart!\r\n\r\nTo swim so far was impossible; I dared not leave the schooner, even\r\nwith a spar or any thing else that would float, as the wind and sea\r\nwere evidently rising together, and to remain on board was almost as\r\ndangerous and hopeless.  I had the risk of drowning by her capsizing,\r\nor lying on her beam ends in the water, and so foundering and going\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nA plank might start in her sheathing--she might even then be filling\r\nby some uncaulked leak!  I had no idea of the state of her hold, and\r\nfrom many reasons feared she might sink before daybreak, and before\r\nmy perilous situation could be discovered from the shore.\r\n\r\nThe waves were black as ink; the sky was moonless overhead, but the\r\npale, white stars winked and twinkled, and were reflected in the\r\ntrough of the ocean.  Now, I could perceive foam cresting the tops of\r\nthe waves, and knew that the breeze was increasing to a gale--a gale\r\nthat was blowing _from_ the land.\r\n\r\nThis added to my despair, for the lights I had seen soon disappeared,\r\nand the dark outline of the coast seemed to sink lower and to blend\r\nwith the sea.  Clutching the weather rigging, I could scarcely keep\r\nmy feet, so slippery was the now wetted deck, and so cold and\r\nbenumbed were my hands and arms by the chill atmosphere of the ocean,\r\nand by the salt spray which ever and anon flew over me in bitter\r\nbriny showers.\r\n\r\nI shouted, but the mocking wind bore my voice away to seaward.  With\r\ndespairing eyes I swept the dusky water, in the hope of seeing a\r\nvessel, a fishing boat, or the light of a steamer near; but gazed,\r\nwith haggard glance, in vain.\r\n\r\nI had no hope now but to wait for dawn of day; and when it came,\r\n_where_ might I and the empty schooner be?  Fortunately, her topmasts\r\nwere struck, her fore-yard was lowered, and all her gear made\r\ntolerably snug.  Her canvas, however, was only in the brails, and a\r\nportion of the fore-and-aft foresail having got loose, it was swelled\r\nout by the blast, and kept her head partially before the wind, thus\r\naccelerating the rate at which she was borne _from_ the land, and\r\nbeing without trimming or ballast, she danced over the waves, as I\r\nhave said, like a cork, but in momentary danger of capsizing and\r\nfoundering.  As dawn drew near, the cold increased so much, that\r\nthough at the risk of being passed unseen by some coaster, I was fain\r\nto creep on my hands and knees to the companion hatch, and descend\r\ninto the cabin.\r\n\r\nIt was darker now than ever, for the lamp had gone out.\r\n\r\nThe memory of the captain's weird story made me shudder.  His words,\r\n\"I was lying in the larboard berth--_there_, on the cabin floor, I\r\nstruck the figure down,\" seemed ever in my ears, and the pale,\r\nspectral face he had portrayed, with the moonbeams streaming on its\r\nghastly features and glazing eyes, were ever before me in the dark\r\nfilling my young heart with a chilling horror.\r\n\r\n\"Oh to be ashore!\" I exclaimed passionately, with clasped hands;\r\n\"ashore, and free from this floating prison!\"\r\n\r\nI thought of my gentle and loving mother, and my soul seemed to die\r\nwithin me.  The schooner would be missed by daybreak--the alarm would\r\nbe given; _her_ alarm would rapidly become irrepressible anxiety,\r\nwhich would soon turn to a despair that nothing could alleviate.\r\n\r\nSounds like thunder, or like tremendous blows, at times made me\r\nstart.  These were caused by billets of wood, mallets, or pieces of\r\npig-iron, pitching about in the hold of the schooner, as she rolled,\r\nand lurched, and righted herself, to roll and lurch again.\r\n\r\nFor a time I cowered miserably in the dark cabin, until my childish\r\nfears overmatched reason, and I crept once more upon deck.\r\n\r\nA regular gale was blowing now, and the schooner careened fearfully\r\nbeneath it on her starboard side, while the bellying of that portion\r\nof the fore-and-aft foresail which had got loose aided in hurrying\r\nher faster out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe light of the coming day was spread in dull gray over the sky,\r\nimparting the same cold tint to the whitening waves.  Land was still\r\nvisible, but it seemed like a dark bank at the horizon.  I supposed\r\nit to be about ten miles distant, but what part of the coast, or how\r\nfar from Erlesmere, I knew not.\r\n\r\nNow I began to be assailed by that illness, which terror and anxiety\r\nhad hitherto but partially repressed--a violent sea-sickness in all\r\nits horror.  Afraid of being washed from the deck over which the\r\nwaves were breaking now, once more I crept in wretchedness below.\r\n\r\nBefore descending, I cast a despairing glance at the loosening sail\r\nwhich still caught the wind it was a source of increasing danger\r\nwhich dared not attempt to remedy, even had I strength to have done\r\nso, for the wet deck was now sloping like the roof of a house, and I\r\nwould assuredly have fallen into the sea to leeward.  After several\r\nfeeble efforts, I succeeded in partially closing the companion hatch,\r\nfor warmth and security, and descending, threw myself on the cabin\r\nfloor, sick and despairing.\r\n\r\nThe lurching of the vessel, the closeness of the atmosphere, and\r\ngeneral odor of the cabin, overpowered me at last; I became fearfully\r\nill, and from being so, lapsed into unconsciousness, after enduring\r\nall the wretchedness induced by that ailment of the ocean.  For the\r\ntop of my head seemed about to fly off, its sides to be crushed in;\r\nthere was a singing in my ears, an ache in my eyeballs; and then came\r\nthat awful sinking of the pulses, of the body, of the soul itself,\r\nwhich thousands have endured in cases of aggravated sea-sickness, but\r\nnone have been able to depict.\r\n\r\nIn short, after a paroxysm of illness and tears, I became totally\r\nunconscious of the peril and horror of my situation, and found a\r\nrefuge in sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nUSELESS REGRETS.\r\n\r\nI must have lain long thus.  On recovering, I rose more stiff and\r\nmore benumbed than ever, and with feeble steps ascended the companion\r\nladder, and then a cry of despair escaped me.\r\n\r\nThe sky was clear and sunny, but whether with the light of a rising\r\nor a setting sun, I could not at first determine, morning and evening\r\non the ocean being so much alike to an unpractised eye.  Not a\r\nvestige of land was visible!\r\n\r\nSea and sky were around me; not a sail was in sight, and nothing\r\nliving was near, save a few petrels tripping over the water,\r\nalongside of the fatal schooner.\r\n\r\nHad I slept all night, and was this the dawn of a new day?  Had I\r\nslept all day, and was this the approach of another night?  I\r\ndevoutly hoped not, as I most dreaded night upon the ocean; but the\r\ngradual sinking of the sun, and the increasing redness of the sky,\r\nere long informed me that the time was evening.  I now knew the west,\r\nand turned my haggard eyes to the south, for there the land and my\r\nhome lay; but still the envious wind, though lighter now seemed to\r\nblow _from_ that quarter.\r\n\r\nOh! how deeply and earnestly, by thoughts unuttered, I prayed in my\r\nheart that it would change and blow toward the shore--any shore--or\r\nany part of the coast of England, and bring me so near that I might\r\nhave a chance of escape of life and preservation by swimming--by\r\nputting to the test that skill and those powers of activity I had\r\nacquired at Eton, in the waters of the Thames.\r\n\r\nThe sea was comparatively smooth, but still the empty schooner rolled\r\nand lurched fearfully; the more so, that the fore-and-aft foresail\r\nwas hanging so loosely in the brails.\r\n\r\nA hundred years seemed to have elapsed since I had heard the dear\r\nvoices and seen the loved faces of those I had left at home--of my\r\nfather, my mother, of Dot, and of Sybil; while the events of my early\r\nschoolboy days seemed to have occurred but yesterday.\r\n\r\nAll time was chaos and confusion!\r\n\r\nIn my sorrow and despair, I never thought, unless with anger, of Jan\r\nvan Zeervogel, the poor Dutch skipper, whose interests were so much\r\ninvolved with the loss or safety of his little schooner, with which\r\nthe flood-tide had made so free.  I thought only of my own danger,\r\nand my mother's sorrow for the mystery that would overhang my fate.\r\n\r\nNow hunger assailed me, creating a new terror lest I should perish by\r\nwant of food; and all I had read or heard of wrecks, rafts, and\r\ncastaways crowded on my memory, to aggravate the real perils which\r\nsurrounded me.\r\n\r\nOnce more I sought the cabin, and on finding an axe broke open what\r\nappeared to be a press or locker.  Therein were several cups,\r\nbottles, and drinking glasses, placed in perforated shelves; but\r\nnothing eatable save a single hard and mouldy biscuit, which the rats\r\nabandoned on my approach, and nothing drinkable save the remains of\r\nthe brandy in which the peaches had been preserved--and I viewed the\r\njar with horror, as the primary cause of all my sufferings and\r\ndangers;--I say the remains, for it had fallen from the table and\r\nbeen broken to pieces; so nothing remained of its contents, except\r\nabout a gill in a fragment, and the peaches which lay in the lee or\r\nlower side of the cabin.\r\n\r\nWhat would I not have given for a single drop of pure cold water, to\r\nalleviate that choking thirst which is ever the sequel to sickness,\r\nexcitement, and sorrow!  But there was not a drop on board, as the\r\nscuttle-butt had broken its lashings, in one of the lurches of the\r\nschooner, and fallen overboard to leeward.  So I soaked the mouldy\r\nbiscuit in the brandy, ate it, and went on deck, in time to see the\r\nsun set at the watery horizon, from whence he cast a long and\r\ntremulous line of yellow splendor along the dancing waves, to where\r\nthe schooner floated in her loneliness.\r\n\r\nNight followed, and one by one the stars appeared in the mighty blue\r\ndome overhead; there was no moon as yet, and I thought of hoisting a\r\nlight at the mainmast head, but where were a lantern and matches to\r\nbe found?\r\n\r\nI thought also of lifting the fore-hatch, to explore the fore-part of\r\nthe schooner, but I felt too feeble and sick at heart; and now with\r\nthe gloom of night the ghost-story of the Dutch skipper recurred to\r\nme.\r\n\r\nThirst was now becoming an agony, and I inhaled the dewy atmosphere\r\nin vain, for its property was saline, and seemed to make my\r\nsufferings greater; but happily it induced a drowsiness.  I crept\r\nbelow, and seeking the bed in the captain's berth, drew the clothes\r\nover me and strove to sleep--and so weary was I, that sleep came.\r\n\r\nI had now been two nights and a day on board this fatal craft.  My\r\nparents and my sisters--what would their thoughts, their fears, their\r\nsorrow be!\r\n\r\nIn my sleep their voices came to my ear, and I felt my mother's kiss\r\nupon my cheek so palpably, that I started and nearly awoke.\r\n\r\nThen old Eton came before me, with its sombre brick quadrangles, its\r\nbronze statue of King Henry the Sixth; the ancient college, with its\r\nrich buttresses and carved pinnacles, and the great window, past\r\nwhich the Thames sweeps on to London, between its green and lovely\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\nThe old monastic hall, and then the Playing Fields in all their sunny\r\ngreenness, shaded by their solemn old elm trees, recurred to me; then\r\nthe seclusion of the library where I had spent many an hour; then\r\ncame the voices of my old companions at cricket, or shouting as they\r\nurged their trim-built skiffs, with the murmur of the river, the\r\nfamiliar toll of the chapel bell, and the voices of the choristers,\r\nall mingling in my dreaming ear, as with a \"drowsy hum.\"\r\n\r\nAnon I seemed to hear the merry English chime of bells ringing in the\r\nold square tower of Erlesmere Rectory; but they sunk amid the hiss\r\nand gurgle of the bitter surf and the moan of the midnight sea.\r\n\r\nNow, I thought how rapturously I could have clasped my dear mother's\r\nneck!  How gladly I would have obeyed my poor father and gone\r\nwherever he wished me--even to my uncle's dingy counting-house in the\r\nCity, there to spend the remainder of my existence, if fate so willed\r\nit, on a tripod stool, chin-deep among red-edged ledgers, invoices,\r\ntelegrams, and dockets of papers.\r\n\r\nI endeavored to remember all my parents had taught me in their\r\nprayers and precepts, and how often I had been reminded by the good\r\nold Rector that without the knowledge of Heaven not even a sparrow\r\ncould fall to the ground; and I thought that surely I must be worth a\r\nwhole army of sparrows.\r\n\r\nFrom these dreams and ideas--I must have been half awake--I was\r\nroused by a violent lurch of the schooner.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the deck, I found that a gale had again come on, and that\r\nthe sea was whitened with foam, amid which the sea-birds were blown\r\nwildly hither and thither; that the moon was now on the wane, and\r\nshed a cold, weird light between the black masses of flying scud,\r\nupon the tumbling billows and the empty schooner, which yet floated\r\nbuoyantly enough.  But she now careened fearfully to port.  I foresaw\r\nthat unless the masts were cut away, a capsize was inevitable, for\r\nthe wild wind howled over the waste of seething water, and the\r\nschooner groaned and trembled as wave after wave thundered on her\r\nempty and resounding hull.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my weakness, I endeavored to tighten the brailing of\r\nthe fore and aft foresail; but how vain was the attempt!  The moment\r\nI removed the rope from the belaying pin, it was torn from my hand;\r\nthe whole sail fell heavily loose, and swelled out upon the wind.  It\r\nflapped with a sound like thunder in the blast, and in a moment, the\r\ndeck seemed to pass from under my feet, and I was struggling alone in\r\nthe midnight sea.\r\n\r\nTo the horror of being drowned was now added that of being devoured\r\nby the fishes.\r\n\r\nA cry to heaven escaped me, as I rose panting and almost breathless,\r\nand struck out to prolong existence.  The sea repelled and buoyed me\r\nup, for it is by no means so easy to sink as many persons imagine.\r\n\r\nThe schooner, was lying now completely on her beam ends to port; her\r\nmasts and half her deck, were in the water.  It had filled the belly\r\nof the loosened sail, and served to keep her steady; but still the\r\nwaves washed wildly over the hull.  I knew she must soon fill and go\r\ndown; yet so strong is the instinct of self-preservation, that I soon\r\nreached the foremast, climbed into the now horizontal rigging, and\r\nseated myself on the row of dead-eyes, through which the shrouds are\r\nrove, clutching them with wild tenacity, while drenched, cold, and\r\ndespairing.\r\n\r\nThe spray flew over me, thick as rain, but bitter, heavy, and\r\nblinding.\r\n\r\nHow long I could have survived, I know not; but I felt as one in a\r\ndreadful dream, and acted with the decision and firmness with which\r\nwe often seem to acquit ourselves amid the most fantastic situations\r\ncreated by the fancy in sleep.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, amid the stupor that was coming over me, I heard a voice\r\nand saw a large brig looming between me and the pale waning moon.\r\nShe was close by, with her courses, topsails, jib, and fore-and-aft\r\nmainsail set, but with her foreyard laid to the wind as she lay to.\r\nThen I heard the rattle of the blocks and tackle, as a boat descended\r\nfrom the stem davits with a splash into the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Cheerily, now, my lads, give way!\" cried the voice I had heard\r\nbefore; \"pull to windward round this craft, and overhaul her.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a man in the fore-rigging!\" cried another.\r\n\r\n\"Then stand by in the bow with the boat-hook.\"\r\n\r\nI strove to speak, to shout; but my voice was gone.\r\n\r\n\"Spring into the sea,\" cried a voice; \"do you hear me, you sir--you\r\nin the fore-rigging there?  Jump in; we cannot sheer alongside a\r\ncraft that pitches about like a cork in such a sea as this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't fear, my lad,\" cried others; \"we'll pick you up.\"\r\n\r\nBut I was powerless, blinded by spray; and though unable to respond,\r\nclutched the rattlins with fatuous energy.  Then strong hands were\r\nlaid upon me, and I felt myself dragged into the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Shove off, shove off--give way! this craft will sink in a minute,\"\r\ncried some one; \"give way for the brig!\" and just as they turned the\r\nhead of the boat toward their vessel, the Dutch schooner appeared to\r\nright herself; there was a crash as her deck burst up, and then a sob\r\nseemed to mingle with the air that was expelled from her hold as she\r\nfilled and went down like a stone.\r\n\r\nThough I had been so long unseen, I afterwards learned that at this\r\ntime there were not less than fifteen sail in sight of the vessel\r\nwhich picked me up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE EUGENIE.\r\n\r\nAfter being conveyed on board, hot brandy punch was readily\r\nadministered to me; all my wet clothes were taken off, and I was put\r\ninto a snug berth, the cosy warmth of which, together with the effect\r\nof the steaming punch--\"a stiff nor'-wester,\" as I heard it\r\ncalled--and the toil and misery, mental and bodily, I had undergone,\r\nall conduced to give me a long and almost dreamless slumber.  Thus\r\nthe noon of the next day was far advanced before I awoke to the\r\nrealities of life and a consideration of the awkward predicament in\r\nwhich I was placed.\r\n\r\nI had been picked up by the _Eugenie_, a new brig of two hundred and\r\nfifty tons register, \"coppered to the bends, and standing A1 at\r\nLloyds,\" as I was informed by Samuel Weston, her master.  He added\r\nthat she had a crew of twelve hands, men and boys, exclusive of Marc\r\nHislop, the mate, and Tattooed Tom, his assistant, and that the brig\r\nhad the reputation of being one of the best sailing vessels out of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nThe morning was fine and warm; the skylight was open, and a pleasant\r\ncurrent of air passed through the clean wainscotted cabin.  A\r\nspotless white cloth was on the table, across which there were lashed\r\ncertain bars of wood, technically termed a fiddle, to keep the plates\r\nand glasses from falling to leeward; and on looking from my curtained\r\nberth (for I was not permitted to rise), I saw the captain and mate\r\nat lunch over brandy and water, biscuits and cheese; and busy the\r\nwhile with charts and compasses, as they were comparing their\r\nnautical notes and observations.\r\n\r\nThe brig seemed to be running steadily through the water upon the\r\nstarboard tack, and I could hear the gurgle of the sea under her\r\ncounter, as it bubbled away in the wake astern--in fact, the sound\r\nseemed to be just a foot above my ear, realizing the terrible idea\r\nthat there was \"only a plank between me and eternity.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Samuel Weston was a well-made man of the middle height, and\r\nsomewhere about forty years of age.  He was rather grave than jovial\r\nin manner, but pleasant, kind, and gentlemanly.  There was nothing\r\nabout him that particularly indicated the seaman, and he never used\r\nstartling adjectives, or according to the proverbial idea interlarded\r\nhis conversation with obscure nautical phraseology.\r\n\r\nHe wore a short pea-coat with brass buttons, and a straw hat.  A\r\nhandsome gold ring secured his necktie, and the fag-end of a cheroot\r\nwas between his teeth.  He was exactly portrayed thus in his colored\r\ncalotype, which was framed and screwed into the bulkhead.  Close by\r\nit was another of a lady, with a little boy, standing at the base of\r\na column, which of course had a crimson curtain festooned behind it;\r\nand they, I had no doubt, were his wife and child.  So Captain\r\nSamuel--or as he preferred to call himself--Sam Weston was more\r\ndomestic in his tastes than those who usually live by salt water are\r\nsupposed to be.\r\n\r\nNeither was there any thing particularly nautical in the appearance\r\nof the mate, who was a smart and athletic young fellow, about\r\nfive-and-twenty years of age, with somewhat of a Glasgow accent, keen\r\ngray eyes, and sandy-colored hair; and he it was (though I was not\r\naware of it then, or for long after) who boldly plunged into the\r\nstormy sea, and swam to the foundering schooner, and finding that I\r\ncould neither understand nor obey his instructions, had made a line\r\nfast to my waist, and thus conveyed me safely into the boat; so to\r\nthis young Scotsman I owed my life and a debt of gratitude.\r\n\r\nOn perceiving that I was awake, a hand-bell was rung by the captain,\r\nand hot coffee, accompanied by the last slice of shore-bread that\r\nremained was brought to me by Billy, the cabin-boy, and then, after a\r\ntime, I was requested to state what craft that was from which I had\r\nbeen taken, my name, and so forth, that Mr. Hislop might enter all\r\nthe particulars among the \"remarks\" in his log-book.\r\n\r\nI soon satisfied them as to all this.\r\n\r\n\"And where am I now?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty far out upon the open sea, my lad,\" replied the captain with\r\na smile, as he threw the end of his cheroot into the empty grate.\r\n\r\n\"The open sea--_still_ the open sea!\" I reiterated with dismay, which\r\nI cared not to conceal.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; we saw the last glimpse of the rugged Start on the day before\r\nyesterday, and this morning, just an hour before picking you up, we\r\nbade good-by to old England, for the Lizard Light was bearing--you\r\nhad the dead watch, Hislop; how did it bear?\"\r\n\r\n\"About twelve miles off, on the weather quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\"How shall I return home?\"\r\n\r\nThey both laughed as I despairingly made this inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"By the way you left it, I suppose; that is by water,\" said Captain\r\nWeston.\r\n\r\n\"You spoke of the Start; what is that?\"\r\n\r\n\"A cape of the Channel, on the south-east coast of Devonshire, about\r\nnine miles to the southward of Dartmouth,\" he replied, while casting\r\na casual glance at a chart which lay on the table.\r\n\r\nI had thus, before being rescued so providentially, drifted more than\r\na hundred miles from Erlesmere, and it was marvellous that the\r\nschooner had floated so far unseen.\r\n\r\n\"That lubberly old Dutchman, Zeervogel, should have made his craft\r\nsecure, by mooring her so that the flood-tide could not have floated\r\nher off shore.  But,\" added the captain, laughing, \"he may have a\r\nclear case of barratry against you, if you ever return to England.\"\r\n\r\n\"Barratry--what is that?\" I asked, with a bewildered air.\r\n\r\n\"A landshark's phrase for running away with a ship--carrying her out\r\nof her course--sinking or deserting her; or doing any thing by which\r\nshe may be arrested, detained, or lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the schooner ran away with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the sea with you both.  Well, what is to be done now?  We are\r\nbound for the West Indies, but we may put you aboard the first craft\r\nthat passes us, homeward-bound; or you are free to remain, if we\r\ncannot do better for you.\"\r\n\r\nI thought of my mother, of my father, my two sisters; and my heart\r\nwas so full of gratitude to Heaven for preserving me to the end, that\r\nI might see and embrace them all again, that I had no words to reply.\r\nAfter a time I exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Home, home!--let me go home to Erlesmere!\"--weeping as I spoke, for\r\nthe thought of them all made me a very child again.\r\n\r\nThe captain and mate exchanged glances of inquiry.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use piping your eye now, my lad,\" said the former, coming\r\ntoward my berth; \"but answer me quietly.  You said that your name was\r\nRodney?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you spoke of Erlesmere; are you a son of old Dr. Rodney, the\r\nrector?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know my father, then?\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Can't say exactly that I have the honor of being known to him; but I\r\nknow of him, right well.  Why, Master Rodney, I have sailed your\r\nuncle's ships many a time, and know his gloomy old office in the\r\ncity, as well as the buoy at the Nore; so you are as safe and as\r\nwelcome aboard the _Eugenie_ as if in the old Rectory-house at home.\"\r\n\r\nThis was pleasant intelligence, at all events; but my earnest desire\r\nwas to return--a design which was not fated to be speedily gratified.\r\n\r\n\"The pain which is first felt when the infant branch is first torn\r\nfrom the parent tree,\" says Southey, in a passage of great beauty,\r\n\"is one of the most poignant we have to endure through life; there\r\nare other griefs which wound more deeply, which leave behind them\r\nscars never to be effaced, which bruise the spirit and sometimes\r\nbreak the heart,--but never, never do we feel so much the want of\r\nlove, and the keen necessity of being loved, as when we are _first_\r\nlaunched from the haven of our boyhood, into the wide and stormy sea\r\nof life!\"\r\n\r\nI felt the _wrench_ of this separation in all its intensity for a\r\ntime, and longed for the means of returning home; but for several\r\ndays we passed only outward bound vessels, or others which were at\r\nsuch a distance that the task of signalling and speaking with them\r\nwould have delayed the _Eugenie_ longer than Captain Weston could\r\nrisk.  Two that passed near us, when we showed our ensign, replied by\r\ndisplaying the tricolor of France or the red and yellow bars of\r\nSpain; so there was nothing for me now but to remain contentedly on\r\nboard the _Eugenie_, which was bound for Matanzas with a solid cargo\r\nof steam machinery and coal.\r\n\r\nThe master had no doubt of getting a return freight direct for\r\nLondon; thus six or eight months might elapse before I could return\r\nto Ellesmere.\r\n\r\nMy wardrobe was now in the most deplorable condition; but Weston and\r\nHislop, the first mate, kindly supplied me with all that was\r\nrequisite--\"clothes and shirts for running rigging,\" as the latter\r\nsaid, \"with twenty sovereigns for mainstays, which were sure to be\r\nwell kept, as we were on board ship.\"\r\n\r\nI gradually became reconciled to the novelty of my situation; I\r\nlooked forward hopefully to the time when the sorrow of those I had\r\nleft behind would be alleviated, and began to enjoy to the utmost the\r\nprospect of a voyage in a spanking brig to the shores of Cuba.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE SCOTCH MATE'S YARN.\r\n\r\nCould I have anticipated all that was still before me, in the form of\r\nsuffering and of peril--suffering enough to shatter a stronger frame\r\nand shake a stouter heart than mine--I would have returned in any\r\nvessel bound for any part of Europe, and trusted to Providence for\r\nthe means of again reaching home, rather than have remained in the\r\n_Eugenie_.\r\n\r\nBut who can lift the veil which so happily hides the future from us?\r\n\r\nSo I turned my thoughts toward the West Indies with pleasure; I\r\nresolved not to be an idler or loblolly boy, and was allowed by\r\nCaptain Weston to take my watches and share of deck duty with the\r\nrest of the crew; and at intervals, I worked hard at a Spanish\r\ngrammar with Marc Hislop, who could read _Don Quixote_ in the\r\noriginal, with a fluency that even my old tutor at Eton might have\r\nenvied.\r\n\r\nWe were now clear of the Channel; and, after a hard battle with the\r\nwind and sea, we felt the long roll of the mighty Atlantic.\r\n\r\nOn the third night after my rescue, we encountered dark and cloudy\r\nweather, with a strong gale, which set all the cabin afloat.  My\r\nwatch was over, and I had just turned in, when I heard the voice of\r\nCaptain Weston who was on deck, shouting through his trumpet to\r\n\"close reef the maintopsail, hand the mainsail, foresail, and fore\r\ntopsail.  Look alive there, lads,\" he added, \"or as sure as my name\r\nis Sam Weston, I'll give the colt to the last man off the deck!\"\r\n\r\nThis threat, so unusual in one so good-natured, together with the\r\nbellowing of the wind, the flapping of the wetted canvas, the rattle\r\nof the blocks and cordage, and the laboring of the brig, which was so\r\ndeeply laden that every timber groaned, all gave such indications of\r\na rough night, that I sprang from my berth, and proceeded to dress\r\nagain in haste.\r\n\r\nTo my astonishment, at that moment I heard the hoarse rattle of the\r\nchain cable, as it rushed with a roaring sound through the iron mouth\r\nof the hawse hole; then I was sensible of a violent shock, which made\r\nthe brig stagger, and tumbled me headlong against the panelled\r\nbulk-head which separated the cabin from the after-hold.\r\n\r\nHislop, who had been dozing on the cabin-locker in his storm jacket,\r\nstarted up with alarm in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Have we come to anchor?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Anchor in more than three hundred fathoms of water?\" he exclaimed,\r\nas he rushed on deck, whither I followed, and found that a very\r\nstrange incident had occurred.\r\n\r\nIn the murky obscurity of the stormy night, a large Dutch lugger, in\r\nballast apparently, and running right before the wind, with steering\r\ncanvas set, came suddenly athwart us, and hooked the anchor from the\r\ncathead on our larboard bow--by some unwonted neglect it was not yet\r\non board, nor had the cable been unbent--with her starboard\r\nfore-rigging, and thus bore away with it, until the chain came _to\r\nbear_, when there was a tremendous shock.  Several feet of our\r\nbulwark were torn away, and two seamen, Tattooed Tom, and an old\r\nman-o'-war's man named Roberts, were nearly swept into the sea,\r\nwhere, in such a night, and amid the confusion of such an incident,\r\nthey would inevitably have perished unaided.\r\n\r\nThen we heard a shout, mingled with a crash upon the bellowing wind,\r\nas the Dutchman's foremast snapped by the board, and then,\r\nfortunately, our anchor tumbled from his side into the sea, where it\r\nswung at the whole length of the chain cable.\r\n\r\nWe manned both windlass and capstan--got the anchor, which was\r\ndrifting, roused to the cathead, hoisted it on board, unbent the\r\ncable, and stowed it in the tier; but long ere all this was done, we\r\nhad lost sight of our lubberly friend, who, when last seen, was\r\ntossing about like a log in the darkness, and drifting far astern of\r\nus.  But for some defect in the pawls and notches of the windlass\r\ncollar, I am doubtful if the chain would have run out so freely; but\r\nas to this I cannot say.\r\n\r\nWe had hard squalls and a sea that ran high until daybreak; there was\r\nlightning too; red and dusky, it seemed at times to fill the whole\r\nhorizon.  We could see for an instant the black summits of the waves\r\nas they rose and fell between us and the glare; and when it passed\r\naway, all again would be obscurity and gloom.\r\n\r\n\"More canvas must be taken off the brig, sir,\" suggested Hislop,\r\nlooking aloft and then over the side, where the foam-flecked sea\r\nwhirled past us.\r\n\r\n\"Well, in with the trysail, foretopsail, and maintopsail,\" ordered\r\nWeston.\r\n\r\nAs the light of dawn stole over the angry sea, through clouds of\r\nmingled mist and rain, the gale abated, and all but the watch went\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n\"That lugger making off with our anchor,\" said Hislop, \"reminds me of\r\nhow, after we failed to run off with a whale, he fairly ran off with\r\n_us_.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said I, my teeth chattering as I tucked myself into bed again.\r\n\r\n\"You must know, that about ten years ago I was an apprentice aboard a\r\nsmall whaler, a ninety-ton schooner, out of Peterhead.  We were\r\nreturning in very low spirits after an unsuccessful voyage, and, by\r\nstress of weather, were forced toward the rocky and dangerous coast\r\nof Norway, where we came to anchor one evening in a solitary bay,\r\namong the rugged islets which stud the mouth of the Hardanger-fiord,\r\nto repair some trifling damages.  As day broke, there was a shout\r\nraised by the watch on deck.\r\n\r\n\"'A whale!--a whale!--in the shoal water!'\r\n\r\n\"And there, sure enough, far up the bay, we saw one sporting and\r\ngambolling, blowing and diving; and though it was a kind of robbery,\r\nperhaps, we resolved to make a dash at him, for the place was lonely,\r\nand not a Norwegian eye upon us--not a house upon the shore, nor a\r\nman upon the mountains, so far as we could discern by our glasses.\r\n\r\n\"The boats were cleared, the harpoons prepared, the lines were coiled\r\naway in the tubs, and the schooner was hove short on her anchor; but\r\njust as we lowered the whaling-punts, down dived our fish, tail\r\nuppermost, and then we knew that he was searching for his favorite\r\nfood, of which plenty is to be found in these Norwegian fiords.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"A kind of small salt-water snail, and the _medusa_, or sea-blubber.\r\nAs you have been at Eton, you must have read all about it in\r\n_Linnæus_,\" continued our learned Scotch mate.  \"Just as the first\r\nboat was lowered, the schooner received a shock so violent that her\r\nmasts strained almost to snapping; her bows were dragged down till\r\nher billet-head dipped in the water, and every thing and everybody on\r\ndeck went toppling and tumbling forward in a heap about the windlass\r\nbitts.  Then a shower of bloody spray fell over us as the craft\r\nrighted again, but with such violence that the water splashed under\r\nthe counter and over the quarter.  Then she was torn through the sea\r\nat the rate of thirty knots an hour!\r\n\r\n\"We had scarcely time to form an idea, or to utter an exclamation,\r\neither of surprise or fear, when we saw, a cable's length right\r\nahead, an immense whale, the same fish we were preparing to attack,\r\nrushing through the waves with railway speed, and dragging us after\r\nhim by our anchor, of the flukes of which he had somehow run foul in\r\nhis gambols down below.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! do you mean to say that the whale ran off with the schooner?\"\r\nI exclaimed, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"Just as a scared dog runs away with a kettle at his tail.  It was\r\none of the blunt-headed cachalots, about sixty feet long.  They are\r\nthe most hideous fish of the whole whale species, having a head that\r\nis enormously thick, and one third of their entire size, the\r\nspout-hole being at the fore end of it.\r\n\r\n\"In less time than I have taken to tell you all this, we were dragged\r\nout of the fiord; its rocks of black basalt and its sombre pine woods\r\nlessened astern; its entrance seemed to close like a gate as it\r\nblended with the coast; and the schooner, with her loose foretopsail\r\nall aback against the mast, was dragged in the wind's eye (whales\r\nusually swim so) for more than twenty miles out to sea.  Then the\r\ncachalot raised its mighty head about ten feet from the water,\r\nspouted a jet of froth into the air, and disappearing, sunk, leaving\r\nour anchor swinging or drifting in the deep water, at the full length\r\nof the chain cable.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how came all this about?\" I asked, dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"Incredible as it may appear, this monstrous cachalot, while running\r\nalong the sandy bottom of the bay, with mouth distended, in search of\r\nsea-blubber, had by some means uprooted our anchor, though five\r\nhundred weight, by his nether jaw, and so carried it off with eighty\r\nfathoms of cable, and us at the other end of it.  And now, Dick\r\nRodney, what do you think of _that_ for a yarn?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think with Polonius, in _Hamlet_,\" said I, yawning, and turning\r\nwearily in my berth, through the yolk or bull's-eye of which the gray\r\nlight of day was now struggling.\r\n\r\n\"That it is very like a whale, eh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so do I,\" said Hislop, laughing; \"but though a close laid yarn,\r\nit is a true one, nevertheless.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE CONTINUED.\r\n\r\nI found the captain and mate of the _Eugenie_ both pleasant and\r\ninstructive companions.\r\n\r\nThe latter, like the generality of his countrymen, was well educated;\r\nhe was tolerably read in classical lore, and knew all the current\r\nliterature of the day; thus his little state-room was so crammed with\r\nbooks, that he had scarcely room to move in it.  Like many other\r\nScotchmen of humble birth or limited means, Marc Hislop had educated\r\nhimself, beyond what schools or teachers could have done.  Though\r\nusually quiet in disposition, he was sometimes impatient, and more\r\nthan once I have seen him snatch from his pocket a colt (a piece of\r\nknotted rope eighteen inches long) for the special benefit of the\r\nship-boys, of whom we had three on board.\r\n\r\nHe was so learned on the theory and law of storms, with the practical\r\nexposition thereof, and could talk so fluently about straight,\r\ncircular, and parallel winds, storm-waves, and storm-focuses, the\r\nheight of a cyclone, and speed of a hurricane, that honest Sam\r\nWeston, the captain and Tom Lambourne, the second mate, wondered what\r\nit was all about; as they had weathered many a gale without ever\r\ncaring a jot about the theory or law of them, or without ever\r\ntroubling their brains about where the wind came from, and still less\r\nabout where it _went to_.\r\n\r\nAmong other things, Hislop had a photographic apparatus, by which he\r\ntook the aspect of the sea by moonlight and daylight, and all our\r\nlikenesses, in groups or otherwise.  Tattooed Tom Lambourne, who had\r\nonce been adrift in the bush somewhere, and been decorated with\r\ncertain ineffaceable marks by the natives, came out famously in these\r\nartistic efforts, as he was all over stripes, like a zebra or a New\r\nZealander.\r\n\r\nCalm weather and heavy rains succeeded the gale I have mentioned; but\r\nthe _Eugenie_ steadily kept her course, and two days after, when\r\nspanking along before a fine topgallant breeze, we picked up a\r\nbottle, which was descried by the watch, floating and bobbing in the\r\nwater a few fathoms distant from the brig.  She was at once hove in\r\nthe wind, and Hislop went in the stern boat to bring the bottle on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nAs the most trivial incident becomes of interest on board of ship,\r\nwhere the daily occurrences are so few, and the circle of society so\r\nlimited, considerable concern was excited by the appearance of this\r\nbottle, which seemed to have been freshly corked; and on its being\r\nbroken, we found a scrap of paper--torn apparently from a\r\nnotebook--whereon a hurried and agitated hand had pencilled this\r\nbrief notice:\r\n\r\n\"The _Mary_, clipper ship, of Boston, 20th Nov., 1861, momentarily\r\nexpected to go down--pumps worn out, and the leaks gaining--Captain\r\nand first mate, with _all_ the boats, washed away--God help us!\"\r\n\r\n\"The 20th of November?  It was on that night we encountered the heavy\r\ngale,\" said Weston.\r\n\r\nWe had been on the _skirt_ of the tempest, as Hislop maintained,\r\nwhile the Yankee ship had probably suffered all the fury of it.  From\r\nthe main-cross-trees Captain Weston swept the sea with his telescope,\r\nin vain, for any trace of her; so if that melancholy scrap of paper\r\ntold truth, all was doubtless over long since with the _Mary_ and her\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nIn the cabin that night, a conversation on the probabilities of her\r\ndestruction or escape, led to a recurrence to the miraculous manner\r\nin which the unlucky Dutch schooner had floated so long with me; and\r\nI mentioned to Weston and Hislop the additional terrors I had endured\r\nby the effect of imagination, and a recollection of the strange\r\nincidents told me by Captain Zeervogel; but they ridiculed the story\r\nof the poor man, chiefly, I thought, because \"it was the yarn of a\r\nHollander.\"\r\n\r\n\"Though I am a Scotchman,\" began Hislop----\r\n\r\n\"And come of a people naturally superstitious,\" suggested Weston,\r\nparenthetically----\r\n\r\n\"As all large-brained races are,\" retorted the mate, while filling\r\nhis clay pipe with tobacco.\r\n\r\n\"Well, what were you about to say?\" asked Weston.  \"But first fill\r\nyour glass and pass over the tobacco bag.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was simply about to reiterate that I don't believe in ghosts, or\r\nvalue them any more than I do the Yankee sea-serpent, a rope's end,\r\nor a piece of old junk; I never saw one, or knew a man who had seen\r\none; but every one has heard of a man, that knew _another_ man who\r\nsaw, or believed he saw a ghost.  It is at variance with the laws of\r\nnature, which are so ordered that no such erratic spirit can be.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that,\" replied Weston; \"earth and water have their\r\ninhabitants, so why not the air also?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not the fire?\"\r\n\r\n\"There you go, right before the wind into the troubled sea of\r\nargument--you Scotchmen are all alike.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ghosts are at variance with the workings of Divine wisdom, and we\r\nall know what Jones of Nayland says thereupon.\"\r\n\r\n\"No we don't,\" said Weston; \"who the deuce was _he_--what port did he\r\nhail from?\"\r\n\r\n\"'He who cannot see the workings of a Divine wisdom in the order of\r\nthe heavens, the change of the seasons, the flowing of the tides, the\r\noperations of the wind and other elements, the structure of the human\r\nbody, the circulation of the blood, the instinct of beasts, and the\r\ngrowth of plants, is sottishly blind and unworthy the name of man.'\"\r\n\r\n\"You hear him, Mr. Rodney,\" said Weston; \"now he has got both his\r\nanchor and topsails a-trip; he can pay out whole speeches in this\r\nfashion, all at a breath, as fast as the chain-cable running through\r\nthe hawse-pipe.\"\r\n\r\nBeing fresh from Eton, I was not going to let our learned Scotch mate\r\nhave it all his own way, when Weston resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"If you will listen, you shall hear a strange story in which I bore a\r\nprominent part.\"\r\n\r\n\"As the ghost?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No; but you will soon acknowledge whether or not I had cause for\r\nfear.\"\r\n\r\nAnd after he had replenished his glass and pipe, Captain Sam Weston\r\nbegan in this manner:\r\n\r\n\"About fifteen years ago, I found myself at Matanzas, in Cuba, the\r\nsame port we are bound for now--adrift, without a ship, and almost\r\nwithout a penny in my pocket, among foreigners, Spaniards, and\r\nmulattoes, mestees and quadroons, black, white, and yellow.  I had\r\ngone there as second mate of a ship from Boston, but the tyranny of\r\nour skipper wellnigh drove me mad.  During the voyage he had nearly\r\nkilled three of our men for being slow in sending down the\r\ntop-gallant yards on a squally night.  He beat them till they were\r\nblack and blue with a handspike, and kept them for forty-eight hours,\r\nlashed to ringbolts in the lee-scuppers, that the sea might break\r\nover them, as he said, and cure their sores.\r\n\r\n\"When I interfered to save a poor cabin boy, whom he had hung by the\r\nheels from the main-boom, and was scourging with a heavy colt till\r\nhis back was covered with blood, he produced a bowie knife and\r\nrevolver, threatening to 'shoot or rip me up.'\r\n\r\n\"Just at that moment we were passing a Spanish ship of war which was\r\nat anchor in the bay, about half a mile from us, and had the red and\r\nyellow jack of Castile and Leon flying at his gaff peak.  One of the\r\npoor fellows who had been so severely beaten was then in the foretop,\r\nso I hailed him to make a signal of distress to the Spaniard.\r\n\r\n\"In a moment his blue shirt was off and placed on the lift of the\r\nforeyard.  This meant, Mr. Rodney, that as merchant seamen we\r\nappealed to the man-o'-war for protection, and wanted an armed boat's\r\ncrew.  Thank Heaven, such an appeal is never made in vain by a poor\r\nJack of any country to a British man-o'-war, but the lubberly\r\nSpaniards never noticed the signal, or if so, never heeded it.\r\n\r\n\"The Yankee skipper uttered a fierce laugh.\r\n\r\n\"'Douse that shirt and come down, you sir,' he thundered out; 'down\r\ninstantly, or I will shoot you like a coon.'\r\n\r\n\"But, desperate with fear, the poor fellow now stood upon the yard,\r\nand while one hand grasped the topping lift, with the other he waved\r\nhis shirt to the Spaniards.  I heard the crack of a pistol, and next\r\nmoment he fell a quivering mass upon the deck, stone dead, shot by\r\nthe revolver.\r\n\r\n\"'_That_ will teach you to make signals from my ship, you varmint,'\r\nsnivelled the merciless skipper, giving the body a kick; 'and as for\r\n_you_,' he continued, addressing me, and ramming home his words with\r\nan oath; but before he could get further, I levelled him on the deck\r\nby a blow from a handspike, and tossed his knife and revolver\r\noverboard.\r\n\r\n\"His right arm was broken.  There was a great row about all this\r\nbefore the Alcalde when we got into harbor; our bell was unshipped\r\nand our canvas unbent by a party of Spanish marines; but the captain\r\ncrossed the Alcalde's hand with silver or gold, and there was an end\r\nof it.  There was an end of my engagement too; for the Yankee\r\nweathered me about my salary, seized my chest, my quadrant, even an\r\nold silver watch which my mother gave me to make me comfortable, when\r\nI first went to sea, and then turned me out of the ship.\r\n\r\n\"So with nothing except a Mexican dollar in my pocket, but followed\r\nby my Newfoundland dog Hector, I found myself on a wet and dusky\r\nevening on the great quay of Matanzas, which faces the bay that opens\r\ninto the Gulf of Florida.\r\n\r\n\"Low alike in spirit and funds, I had to endure being jostled by\r\nnegro porters, scowled at by alguazils, ordered about by redcapped\r\nand blackbearded Spanish sentries, who were shirtless and tattered,\r\nand whose brown uniforms and red worsted epaulettes tainted the very\r\nsea-breeze with the odor of garlic and coarse tobacco.\r\n\r\n\"The sun had set behind clouds as red as blood.  The bay was all of a\r\ndeep brown tint, and the shores were black or purple.  I was very sad\r\nat heart, and thought it hard that I, a British seaman, should be\r\nthere an outcast, and all my kit reduced to the clothes on my back,\r\nin the very place where the same flag that Pococke and Albemarle\r\nhoisted on Havana, had brought all the Don Spaniards on their knees\r\nin old King George's time.\r\n\r\n\"However, that would neither find me supper or a bed.  I lost or\r\nmissed my Newfoundland dog Hector, and in the bitterness of my heart\r\nI banned the poor animal for ingratitude in leaving me.  Just as I\r\nwas looking about for a humble posada, where a moiety of my dollar\r\nmight procure me a bed, a man stumbled against me.\r\n\r\n\"'Look alive, cucumber shanks,' said he angrily, in English.\r\n\r\n\"'Do you take me for a negro?' I asked, fiercely.\r\n\r\n\"'You are grimy enough for any thing,' said he; and after being a\r\nnight in the Alcalde's lock-up house, I certainly was not the\r\ncleanest of men; but now it seemed as if the voice of the stranger\r\nwas familiar to me.  I examined his features.\r\n\r\n\"'What,' I exclaimed, 'Hislop--Jack Hislop, is this you?'\r\n\r\n\"''Tis I, Jack Hislop, certainly,' replied the other, who proved to\r\nbe my old friend, Marc's father; 'but who the deuce are you?'\r\n\r\n\"'Your old shipmate, Sam Weston, who sailed with you for many a day\r\nin the _Good Intent_ of Port Glasgow.'\r\n\r\n\"For a moment his tongue seemed absent without leave.\r\n\r\n\"'What, you Sam Weston--English Sam, as we called you--adrift here at\r\nMatanzas among these Spanish land-crabs?'\r\n\r\n\"'Aye, adrift sure enough,' said I, as we shook hands heartily, and\r\nthen adjourned to a taberna, when I told him all about my quarrel\r\nwith the Yankee and my present hopeless condition, over a glass of\r\nnor'-nor'-west.\r\n\r\n\"'I have a brig here on the gridiron, repairing, for we lost some of\r\nher copper in scraping a rock near the Tortugas shoal.  All my crew\r\nare of course ashore, and at present I am residing with a friend,'\r\nsaid Hislop; 'but I can find permanent quarters for you till you get\r\na berth.  Do you see that craft out there in the bay?'\r\n\r\n\"'The polacca brig, about a mile off?'\r\n\r\n\"'Yes.  Well, she is consigned to my owner, but was found adrift,\r\nabandoned by all her crew except two, about fifty miles off, half way\r\nbetween this and the Salt Key Bank.  I have charge of her now, and\r\nthere you may sleep every night if you choose.  What say you to that?'\r\n\r\n\"'That I thank you, old shipmate, with all my heart, but--but--'\r\n\r\n\"'What?'\r\n\r\n\"'I have heard of that polacca, and that the two of her crew who\r\nremained on board--'\r\n\r\n\"'Were dead; yes, true enough.  They were found in their berths, one\r\non the starboard, and the other on the port side of the cabin.  But\r\nwhat of that?  I buried them off the point of Santa Cruz, and there\r\nthey sleep sound enough, believe me, each with a couple of cold shot\r\nat his heels.  Here is the key of the companion hatch, and take my\r\nrevolver with you, for picaros are pretty common hereabout.'\r\n\r\n\"'Thanks, Hislop,' said I; 'but how am I to get on board?'\r\n\r\n\"'Scull over to her in the punt that is moored beside the quay.  When\r\non board make yourself quite at home, for the agent and I left plenty\r\nof grog, beef, biscuits, and tobacco in the cabin.  On the morrow\r\nI'll overhaul you, in the forenoon watch.  Till then, good-by;' and\r\nbefore I could say any thing more, old Jack was gone, and I found\r\nmyself alone on the stone mole, with the key of the polacca's\r\ncompanion in my hand.\r\n\r\n\"There seemed nothing for me but to accept the temporary home thus\r\noffered; so, in the hope that it might lead to something better, I\r\nstepped into the light punt, cast loose the painter, and after a few\r\nminutes' vigorous sculling found myself on the lonely deck of the\r\nsilent polacca.\r\n\r\n\"Her canvas was unbent; most of the running rigging had also been\r\ntaken off her and stowed away,--so her tall and taper spars stood\r\nnakedly up from the straight flush deck, with a sharp rake aft.\r\n\r\n\"Thick banks of dark-blue cloud were coming heavily up from the Gulf\r\nof Florida.  The air was hot and sulphureous; some drops of rain,\r\nwarm, and broad as doubloons, began to plash upon the deck and to\r\nmake circles on the sea; while at the far edge of the horizon a\r\nnarrow streak of bright moonlight, against which the waves were seen\r\nchasing each other, glittered through the flying scud, the bottom of\r\nwhich was uplifted in the offing, like a dark curtain that was\r\ntattered and rent.\r\n\r\n\"Then a flash of red lightning, tipping the waves with fire, shone,\r\nbut to be replaced by instant darkness, and all became black chaos to\r\nseaward, save where a pale-green beacon burned steadily at Santa\r\nCruz, on the western side of the bay.\r\n\r\n\"These signs prognosticated a rough night, but I was glad to perceive\r\nthat the polacca was well moored at stem and stern; so I unlocked the\r\ncompanion door and descended, not without a shudder, into the dark\r\nand cold cabin, where the dead men had been found, and where all was\r\nsilence and gloom.\r\n\r\n\"I struck a lucifer match; my teeth chattered; and while groping\r\nabout for a candle, to make myself comfortable for the night, I began\r\nto wish I had remained on shore.\r\n\r\n\"I found a ship-lantern with the fag-end of a candle in it, and this,\r\nwhen lighted, enabled me to take a survey of the cabin; but I first\r\napplied to the jar of right Jamaica which stood on the table; and\r\nwhen looking about, found my eyes wander so incessantly to the side\r\nberths in which the dead Spaniards had been found, that at last I\r\nalmost fancied their pale sharp profiles and rigid figures were\r\nvisible in the flickering light of the candle.\r\n\r\n\"'Come,' said I, 'Sam Weston--this will never do!  Are you a man, or\r\nhave you become a child again?'\r\n\r\n\"Another application--a long one, too--to the rum jar, and I wrapped\r\nsome bunting, a rug, and a pea-jacket that lay on the locker, round\r\nme, and lay down on the cabin floor to sleep; and scarcely had I\r\nstretched myself there when the candle flared up, and, after casting\r\nsome strange kaleidoscopic figures on the beams overhead, through the\r\nperforated lantern-top--went out!\r\n\r\n\"I was in total darkness now, but more awake than ever.\r\n\r\n\"I felt as if in a great floating coffin, but heard no sound except\r\nthe gurgle of the sea under the counter, or the splash of the stern\r\nwarp, as it whipped the water occasionally.\r\n\r\n\"I kept my eyes closed resolutely, and determined, perforce, to\r\nsleep, and not to wake till morning; but still I could not help\r\nthinking of the two poor fellows who had died in the berths of that\r\ncold, dark, and silent cabin, and been tossed to and fro so long upon\r\nthe sea before they received Christian burial.\r\n\r\n\"Which had died first,--the man in the larboard, or he in the\r\nstarboard berth?  Why were they thus abandoned?  What had they said\r\nto each other?  What messages had they sent to wife, to father, or\r\nmother?  What tale of love to repeat.--of guilt to reveal?--messages\r\ngiven by the dead to the dead, and never delivered!\r\n\r\n\"These thoughts crowded upon me till I almost imagined the dead men\r\nlay there still, and that they might rise and give their last\r\nmessages to me.\r\n\r\n\"Then I heard a sound in the forehold.  It made my blood curdle!  Was\r\nit caused by rats?  Perhaps they had fed on the dead Spaniards and\r\nnow were come to take a nibble at me.  Rats were bad enough, but\r\nghosts were worse.  I took a third and last pull at the Jamaica jar;\r\nsaid my prayers over again, with more than usual devotion, adding\r\nthereto the wish that I should soon have a spanking craft of my own.\r\n\r\n\"Still the idea of the two dead men, with their pale faces and\r\nunclosed eyes, _would_ come before me again and again; and I could\r\nhave groaned but for dread of some similar response that might make\r\nmy heart wither up and my flesh creep.  And creep it soon did; for,\r\njust as this horrid idea of an overstrained fancy, fostered by\r\nimagination and fashioned out of the silence and darkness, became\r\nstrongest within me, what were my emotions,--how painful the\r\nthrobbings of my heart,--on beholding a strange, green ghastly light\r\nglimmering about, and playing _within_ each of the side berths.\r\n\r\n\"While shrinking into a corner of the cabin, with eyeballs straining,\r\nI gazed at them alternately with a species of horrid fascination.\r\nThe two lights were weird, wavering, and pale; they seemed to me as\r\n_two_ warnings from the land of spirits, for they played upon the\r\ncurtains and in the recess of each berth, port, and starboard, in\r\nwhich a dead man had been found.  And while these lights shone, there\r\ncame upon my ear the palpable sound of a heavy breathing and\r\nsnorting, as from the oppressed chest of some one close by me.\r\n\r\n\"I placed my hands upon my eyes and on my ears, to shut out these\r\nhorrid lights and sounds; but when I looked again the former had\r\ndisappeared, and all was opaque darkness.\r\n\r\n\"On putting forth my hand to rise, a cry of uncontrollable terror\r\nescaped me,--a yell that rang in wild echoes through the silent\r\npolacca,--when my fingers came in contact with something icy, and\r\nthen a cold, clammy, and wet head of hair!\r\n\r\n\"Then two glistening eyes seemed to peer and to glare into mine!\r\n\r\n\"In horror and bewilderment, and followed by _something_, I knew not\r\nwhat, I sprang up the companion, and, half fainting, reached the deck\r\nof the polacca.  Then I turned to find that the object which had\r\nexcited so much dismay was no other than my poor dog Hector, which\r\nhad swam off to the brig in pursuit of me.\r\n\r\n\"The eyes that in the dark seemed to glare into mine, were his; the\r\nicy object, from which my fingers shrunk, was his honest black nose;\r\nand what seemed a wet head of hair, was his own curly front; while\r\nthe lights--the mysterious lambent lights--that had flickered about\r\nthe dead men's berths, proved to be nothing more than the green\r\nbeacon on the promontory of Santa Cruz, which shone at times through\r\nthe two stern windows of the polacca.\r\n\r\n\"Being moored with the chain cable ahead, and a manilla warp from her\r\nport quarter to a buoy astern, she swung to and fro a little with the\r\nebb and flow of the tide; hence the oscillation which caused the\r\nmoving gleams that terrified me.\r\n\r\n\"'Ha! ha!' said I, on descending into the cabin, a wiser and a more\r\nsleepy man, 'scared by my own dog Hector!  I have been as great a\r\ngull as ever touched salt water.'\r\n\r\n\"A fortnight afterwards, I shipped with old Jack Hislop as second\r\nmate, and the fifteenth day saw us running before a smart topgallant\r\nbreeze into the Gulf of Florida, bound with a cargo of rum, sugar,\r\nand molasses for the Clyde.\r\n\r\n\"So that is my ghost yarn.  It conveys a moral, does it not?  Order\r\nthem to strike the bell forward.  Hislop, call the watch; see how her\r\nhead bears, and let us turn in.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nA HURRICANE DRIVES US TO THE FORTUNATE ISLES.\r\n\r\nSome days after this we passed a carraca, as the Portuguese name\r\nthose large and round-built vessels which they send to Brazil and the\r\nIndies, and which are alike adapted for burden, fighting, and sailing.\r\n\r\nOn exchanging the bearings--which, when vessels pass each other, are\r\nusually chalked on a blackboard hung over the quarter--Weston and\r\nHislop found a considerable difference between the Portuguese and\r\nours; but never doubting that we were correct, they bore on without\r\nhailing the carraca, as we passed each other on opposite tacks under\r\na press of sail.\r\n\r\nThe weather continued cloudy, and an increased difference was found\r\non exchanging the latitude and longitude with another vessel next\r\nmorning.  Then, after an observation at noon.  Weston found that for\r\nmore than fifty hours the _Eugenie_ had been going several miles to\r\nthe south-east of her due course.\r\n\r\nThe compass was immediately overhauled by Hislop, who found that the\r\nstandard of the needle was loose.\r\n\r\nOn that night there commenced a long course of head winds and foul\r\nweather, during which the compass never worked properly, and the\r\ncaptain and mate found, by the first solar observation, that we had\r\ndrifted so far to leeward as to be somewhere between the parallels of\r\n28° and 28° 35' north.\r\n\r\nTattooed Tom and old Roberts, the man-o'-war's-man, were\r\nsuperstitious enough to give me the entire blame of all this, in\r\nconsequence of having fired one day at some of Mother Cary's\r\nchickens; an action, they averred, which never failed to give the\r\ncraft of the perpetrator a head wind for the remainder of her\r\nvoyage--if she ever finished it at all.\r\n\r\n\"If this foul weather holds for another day,\" said Weston, as he trod\r\nthe deck with a sulkiness quite professional under the circumstances,\r\n\"we shall see land sooner than I wished.\"\r\n\r\n\"Land!\" I reiterated, brightening at the idea more than he relished.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, some part of the Canaries--Santa Cruz de la Palma, most likely;\r\nbut we shall have very rough weather before another sun rises.  I\r\nknow well the signs, Mr. Rodney.  Don't you see what is brewing\r\nyonder, Hislop?\" he said in a low voice to his mate.\r\n\r\n\"You say just what old Roberts, Tattooed Tom, and I were observing\r\nforward,\" replied Hislop.  \"We have not all of us seen a hurricane\r\noff the west coast of Africa, a tornado in the Windward Isles, and a\r\nregular roaring pampero off the Rio de la Plata, without learning\r\nsomething--eh, Captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not; so remember that this gloomy weather, with the wind\r\nlulling away and then coming again in hot gusts with a moaning\r\nsound--in my part of England we name it 'the calling of the sea'--are\r\nalways signs of a coming squall.\"\r\n\r\nAs the night closed in, the canvas on the brig was reduced; the\r\nroyals were struck and the yards sent on deck; the dead lights were\r\nshipped on the stern windows; the quarter boat was hoisted within the\r\ntaffrail, and there lashed hard and fast, for there were increasing\r\ntokens of a coming tempest, and ere midnight it came with a vengeance.\r\n\r\nThe sky at first was all a deep, dark blue, wonderfully dark for that\r\nregion, and the stars, especially the planets, shone with singular\r\nclearness and beauty; but in the north-west quarter of the heavens we\r\ncould see the coming blast.\r\n\r\nFrom the horizon to the zenith, there arose with terrible rapidity a\r\nmighty bank of sable cloud, forming a vast and gloomy arch, at the\r\nbase of which a pale and phosphorescent light seemed to play upon the\r\nheaving sea.\r\n\r\nThis light brightened and sunk alternately.  Now it would shoot\r\ndownward with a lurid glare, steadily and brilliantly, under the\r\nflying vapor, and then it died away with an opal tint.\r\n\r\nSheet lightning, of a pale and ghastly green, extending over ten or\r\ntwelve points of the horizon, flashed and played upon it.  Then we\r\nheard the rush of rain, as if a great lake had been falling from a\r\nvast height into the sea, and next the roar of the mighty blast;\r\nwhile furrowing up the ocean in its passage, the tempest came\r\nswooping down upon us and _around_ us, in a species of whirlwind.\r\n\r\nBravely the _Eugenie_ met it, for her captain and men handled her\r\nnobly.\r\n\r\nShe had her topgallant sails furled, her courses up, the topsails\r\nlowered upon the cap, and the reef-tackles close out; but she swayed\r\nfearfully when careening beneath the hot breath of the mighty blast,\r\nand riding over those black mountains of water, which in fierce\r\nsuccession it impelled toward her.  High she went over a sloping\r\nsheet of foam one moment, and the next saw her plunging into a deep,\r\nblack valley of that midnight sea; so deep, that the wind seemed to\r\npass over us, the canvas flapped to the mast, and we only caught its\r\nweight and power when rising quickly on the crest of the next mighty\r\nroller.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the green-forked lightning flashed so brightly that at\r\ntimes we could see every rope in the vessel, our own blanched and\r\npale faces, as we held on by ringbolts and belaying-pins to save\r\nourselves from being washed overboard by the blinding sheets of\r\nmingled foam and rain that deluged the deck, over which the sea was\r\nalso breaking heavily every instant.\r\n\r\nEach time the _Eugenie_ rose in her buoyancy, her decks were half\r\nfull of water, and the longboat amidships filled so fast that a man\r\nwith a bucket could scarcely keep it baled.\r\n\r\nFollowing the whirlwind, we went round _five_ times in _thirty-five_\r\nminutes, with the after-yards _squared_ and the head-yards braced\r\n_sharp up_.\r\n\r\nThen the black mass of sulphureous cloud in which we were enveloped\r\nseemed to ascend, and with the same rapidity with which it\r\napproached, passed away into the sky; \"the chamber of the thunder,\"\r\nas the Bard of Cona names it, became again clear, blue, and starry,\r\nthough marked by occasional masses of flying vapor.  The rain ceased,\r\nand the _Eugenie_ heaved upon a foam-covered sea, over which there\r\npassed, from time to time, short squalls, compelling us to lower the\r\ndouble-reefed topsails and run before the wind.\r\n\r\nNow a stiff glass of grog was served round to all, and by turns we\r\ncontrived to get some dry clothing.\r\n\r\nIn the end of the middle watch--about four o'clock, A.M.--there was\r\nsuddenly visible, upon our larboard bow, a faint and vapory light\r\nthat shot upward in the sky, from time to time, like jets of steam.\r\n\r\nThis singular appearance was high above the horizon, and first caught\r\nthe anxious eye of Captain Weston.\r\n\r\n\"Hah! do you see that?\" said he to me.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Peak of Adam,--Teneriffe.\"\r\n\r\n\"The great volcanic peak in the Fortunate Isles!\"\r\n\r\n\"Old Tenny Reef in the Canaries, we calls it, sir,\" said Tattooed\r\nTom, who was at the wheel.  \"It ain't a volcano now; but it can't\r\ngive over its old trade o' smoking altogether, and blows up steam\r\nlike a screw propeller, or just as a whale does water through his\r\nspiracles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tom means what the Spaniards term the ventas, or nostrils, of the\r\npeak, through which the aqueous vapors come with a buzzing sound, and\r\nthese cause a species of light,\" said Hislop.\r\n\r\n\"Well, thank Heaven, though we are far out of our course, that blast\r\nhas done no more than wet our storm jackets, and scrape some of our\r\npaint off.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have come out of it uncommon well, sir,\" said Tom, as he stood\r\nwith his feet planted firmly apart on the deck, his hard brown hands\r\ngrasping the wheel, with the helm amidships, as we were still before\r\nthe wind, and the light of the binnacle flaring upward on his\r\nweather-beaten face, with its strange zebra-like stripes,--at least,\r\non so much of his grim visage as the peak of his sou'-wester and a\r\nscarlet cravat that was round his throat and jaws permitted us to\r\nsee.  \"The last time I was in such a breeze was a pampero off the\r\nmouth of the Rio de la Plata, but then we had our foresail split to\r\nribbons, and the ship was canted over on her beam ends almost.  The\r\nmainsail was blown right out of the men's hands, and flapped in the\r\nsky like thunder, while the craft--a five-hundred ton ship she was,\r\nand all copper-fastened--was just on the point of capsizing, when\r\nwith a crash that made our hearts ache, snap went the jibboom and\r\ntopmasts off at the caps, just as you'd break a 'bacca-pipe at the\r\nbowl.  She righted after _that_; but four of our best men were swept\r\naway to leeward, and never seen again.  And now, Master Rodney, with\r\nall your book-learning, or you, Master Hislop, with all yours, can\r\nyou tell me why such things as tornadoes, hurricanes, pamperos, and\r\nthe like, are sent to torment poor hard-working fellows such as me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can,\" said Hislop, turning his handsome but wet and weather-beaten\r\nface to the steersman.\r\n\r\n\"You can, sir?\" reiterated Tom, loudly and incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, in four lines.  Listen,--\r\n\r\n  \"'Perhaps _this_ storm was sent with healing breath,\r\n  From distant climes to scourge disease and death;\r\n  'Tis ours on Thine unerring laws to trust;\r\n  With Thee, great Lord,--whatever _is_ is _just_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Faith, you are right, sir,\" said honest Tom Lambourne, touching his\r\ntarry hat in respect to the mate, mingled with that piety which, in\r\nhis own rugged way, a seaman is never without.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nI GO ASHORE.\r\n\r\nThe wind lulled away into a gentle breeze; reef after reef was shaken\r\nout until a full spread of canvas once more covered the spars of the\r\n_Eugenie_; and to repair some trifling damages of the night we crept\r\nin shore.\r\n\r\nAs day brightened through clouds half rain, half mist, and wholly\r\ngray or obscure, we saw the land looming high and dark.  Beyond it in\r\nthe distance there was a space of vivid light; in the foreground,\r\nsurf white as snow was breaking on the beach, and high over all, in\r\nmid-air, towered the wondrous Peak of Adam, on the eastern side of\r\nwhich the sun (as yet _unrisen_ to us) was shining brightly when we\r\ncame to anchor in the harbor of Santa Cruz.\r\n\r\nWe moored in thirty-three fathoms water, about half a mile from the\r\nshore, which in most places is steep, with green and lovely slopes\r\nrising high above it.  As Captain Weston proposed to weigh next\r\nmorning, he allowed me to go ashore, but sent with me, to be a guide\r\nand companion, Tom Lambourne, the tattooed sailor, who had been\r\nfrequently before at the Grand Canary, and in whom he reposed great\r\ntrust.\r\n\r\nHe gave me a courier-bag containing some provisions, a flask of\r\nspirits, and a telescope; and thus provided, old Tom and I, with such\r\nemotions of pleasure as two newly-escaped schoolboys might feel,\r\nlanded on the shore, which seemed to heave, sink, and rise under my\r\nfeet--for after the late storm I still felt that which is termed \"the\r\nroll of the ship.\"\r\n\r\nIt was in this harbor of Santa Cruz that the famous old English\r\nAdmiral Blake encountered, and within six hours burned and sunk,\r\nseven great Spanish galleons, though they were anchored under the\r\nprotecting cannon of seven forts and a strong castle, in the walls of\r\nwhich some of his shot were shown imbedded for many years after.\r\n\r\nI cast longing eyes to the summit of the mighty Peak of Adam.  It\r\nseemed to rise sheer from the sea, over which, literally _piercing_\r\nthe clouds, it towers to the height of more than twelve thousand\r\nfeet; but the idea of attempting to climb it within so short a space\r\nof time as we had to spend on shore never occurred to me; but what a\r\nfeat it would have been to relate when I returned to Erlesmere!\r\n\r\nThe morning was early yet; the sun was barely above the now cloudless\r\nhorizon; so the shadow of this stupendous cone was cast not only over\r\nthe whole island, which seems to form merely its base, but to the far\r\nhorizon, perhaps beyond it; for there are writers who assert that in\r\nclear weather Cape Bojadore, that dreary and barren promontory of\r\nAfrica, ninety miles distant, is visible from its summit.\r\n\r\nDid the waves of the sea ever overflow that mighty Peak?  At such a\r\nquestion the mind becomes lost in conjecture.\r\n\r\nAs I am not writing a descriptive book of travels, but merely a plain\r\nnarrative of my own very recent adventures, I need not detail at\r\ngreat length either the magnitude or the aspect of this great\r\nisland-mountain of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nFrom cliffs of dark-brown basalt, against which the ocean pours in\r\nvain its foam and fury, we ascended the steep slope of the volcano\r\nfor a few miles.  Then at our feet, as it were, we could see that\r\nfertile island, where a perpetual spring seems to smile, and where\r\nthe fragrant myrtle, the golden orange-trees, and the dark funereal\r\ncypress form the mere hedgerows of those plantations where the\r\nsugar-cane, the broad-leaved plantain, the luscious Indian fig, the\r\ntrailing vine, the fragrant cinnamon, and the pretty coffee-bush,\r\nwere all flourishing in a luxuriance that filled us with wonder and\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\nFurther off was the boundless sea, of that deep blue which it\r\nborrowed from the sky above and mirrored in its depth were the\r\nshipping in the roadstead, with their white canvas hanging loose to\r\ndry in the sun; the green woods and dark rocks reflected downward,\r\nand the old turreted castle of Santa Cruz, with the scarlet and\r\nyellow banner of Castile and Leon on its time-worn ramparts.\r\n\r\nThe summit of the great cone, on the clothed sides of which we never\r\ntired of gazing, soon became lost in vapor; far above the dark-green\r\nbelt of many miles, named the Region of Laurels, and that other belt\r\nor forest of timber, where pines, chestnuts, and oaks of vast size\r\nmingle their varied foliage together, the mountain seemed all of a\r\nviolet tint, which paled away into faint blue as its apex mingled and\r\nbecame lost amid the gossamer clouds.\r\n\r\nThe vines, in luxuriance, bordered the pathway as we ascended, and it\r\nis said that for years after the wine has been taken from these isles\r\nto England or elsewhere, it always ferments and becomes agitated when\r\nthe vineries from whence it came are in bloom; but this tale may\r\nperhaps be as true as the accounts of those mighty ruins which Pliny\r\navers once covered all the Fortunate Islands, but of which no trace\r\nremains now.\r\n\r\nTom Lambourne and I, after a ramble of some hours, found ourselves in\r\na wild and solitary place, where blocks of lava and heaps of\r\nyellow-pumice dust were lying among shattered masses of basalt, which\r\nwere studded with spars and chrystals that glittered as the sunshine\r\nstreamed through a ravine upon them.\r\n\r\nThe sides of this ravine were clothed with rich copsewood and little\r\nthickets of the _retamablanca_, which there grows about ten feet\r\nhigh, and is covered with tufts of odoriferous flowers.  The distant\r\nsea, the waves of which seemed to bask or sleep in the sunshine,\r\nclosed the perspective of this ravine; and there we could see the\r\n_Eugenie_ at anchor, with her snow-white courses loose and her other\r\ncanvas neatly handed.  Being warmed by our walk, we sat down within\r\nthe mouth of a species of natural grotto, formed by masses of lava\r\nand basalt, which in some past age the throes of the volcano had\r\nthrown and heaped together.  There a clear spring gurgled joyously\r\nfrom a fissure in the rocks; and now, opening the courier-bag, we\r\nproceeded to make our breakfast on the viands I had brought from the\r\nship--to wit, Bologna sausage and biscuits, with brandy-and-water.\r\n\r\nThe air was deliciously clear, and over the brow of the rocky chasm\r\nin which we sat, there fell a natural screen of the wild Indian fig\r\nand vine creepers, and these shaded us from the increasing heat of\r\nthe morning sun.  All was still there.\r\n\r\nWe heard only the coo of the great wood-pigeons among the gorgeous\r\nfoliage, or the sweet notes of the little golden-colored canary\r\nbirds, as they twittered about us when we scared them from their\r\nnests, which they usually build in the barrancas or watercourses,\r\nsuch being the coolest places in that volcanic isle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nHOW TOM WAS TATTOOED.\r\n\r\nMy companion was a short and thick-set sailor, about forty years of\r\nage, and whose figure was suggestive of great muscular strength; his\r\nhair was cut short, but his whiskers were of the most voluminous\r\ndescription, as he was anxious to conceal as much as possible of the\r\nstrange circles, stripes, and grotesque designs with which his\r\nsun-burned face was covered, and which by their form and blackness,\r\nimparted a hideous aspect to features that otherwise were rather good\r\nand pleasing.\r\n\r\nHe was an intelligent man, and well read, for the humble class to\r\nwhich he belonged.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, Master Rodney,\" said he, on perceiving that I was still\r\nsurveying him with something of wonder (and his face was a point on\r\nwhich he was particularly sensitive); \"you see what a precious\r\nfigure-head those 'tarnal niggers on the coast of Africa made for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"How did this happen, Tom?\" said I, filling his drinking-horn.\r\n\r\n\"About twenty years ago, Master Rodney, I belonged to the _Arrow_, a\r\nsmart Liverpool bark of two hundred and twenty tons register.  I made\r\nmany voyages in her to South America, but at last, as bad luck, or my\r\ndestiny (as men say in the play) would have it, she was chartered for\r\nthe West Coast of Africa, to trade with the natives, but _not_ in\r\nblack cattle, for slavery was never our line of business.\r\n\r\n\"We sailed from the Mersey in June, and early in August found\r\nourselves at the mouth of the Congo river, after a prosperous voyage;\r\nbut on the night we made the land, a heavy gale came on, and it\r\nveered round all the points of the compass in an hour.  The sea and\r\nsky were as black as they could be, and every thing else was black\r\ntoo, except the breakers on the shore to leeward, and heaven knows\r\nthey were white enough,--too white and too near to be pleasant.\r\n\r\n\"Our skipper handled the _Arrow_ well, and she obeyed every touch of\r\nthe helm as a horse might do its bridle; she was sharply built, but\r\nheavily sparred, and no other square-rigged craft upon the sea could\r\nbeat her on a wind.\r\n\r\n\"I think I see her yet, Master Rodney, for she was the first vessel I\r\nshipped on board of, and hang me if I didn't love her as if she had\r\nbeen my old mother's house, near Deptford docks.\r\n\r\n\"Her hull was long and low, and sat like a swan in the water, only\r\nthat she was not white, like a swan, but as black as paint could make\r\nher.  Aloft, the masts tapered away like fishing-rods, crossed by the\r\nsquare yards, while stays, shrouds, halyards, and hamper, were always\r\ntaut, as if made of cast-iron; but for all this, she failed to\r\nweather that gale off the Congo river.  She missed stays and got\r\nsternway, so you see, sir, it was soon all over with her after that.\"\r\n\r\n\"How--I do not understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't you know what sternway is?  What do they teach folks ashore?\r\nShe was taken aback in the hurricane--the most dangerous thing that\r\ncan happen to any vessel--a sudden shift of wind threw her on her\r\nbroadside in the trough of the sea, and with her deck _toward_ the\r\nstorm, so her hatches were soon beaten in,--all the sooner that she\r\nwas driven on a coral reef near the Shark's Nose, where the sea was\r\nlike a sheet of foam around her.\r\n\r\n\"Five poor fellows were washed away and drowned; but when day broke,\r\nand the storm abated a little, the captain, six men and I, got ashore\r\nin the long boat just as the poor _Arrow_ began to break up, for we\r\ncould see the waves beating into her and rending asunder the decks,\r\nthe inner and outer sheathing, as if they couldn't scatter the cargo\r\nfast enough far and wide.\r\n\r\n\"Well, there we were, shipwrecked in a wild place on the West Coast\r\nof Africa, at a part of the Congo river where the mangrove trees grow\r\ninto the water, and have their lower branches covered with oysters\r\nand barnacles.\r\n\r\n\"We could see high blue hills in the distance when the sun came up\r\nfrom the cane swamps and the wild woods which bordered the river, and\r\nwe sat on the beach for a while looking ruefully at the wreck, of\r\nwhich little now remained but a few timbers, till the increase of the\r\nmorning heat drove us for shelter into a grove of oil-palms, and\r\nthere, Master Rodney, we found tulips, lilies, and hyacinths growing\r\nwild, and six times larger than any you ever saw in England.\r\n\r\n\"Some of our men proposed that we should repair the longboat--she was\r\npartly stove in--and put to sea, or creep in her along the coast\r\nuntil we were picked up.  We were without carpenter's tools; but the\r\ncaptain had a case of surgical instruments, and the first use we made\r\nof the saw was to cut into halves an iron buoy which had floated\r\nashore from the wreck.\r\n\r\n\"Thus we had two kettles, in which we boiled some seabirds and their\r\neggs, and made a mess whereon we breakfasted.  Exhausted by the late\r\nstorm, the birds were easily knocked down by stones as they sat with\r\ndrooping wings upon the rocks near the sea; but scarcely was our\r\nmiserable meal over, when we heard loud yells, and attracted by the\r\nsmoke of our fire, down came a whole gang of ugly darkies, all\r\nMussolongos wild and naked, with rings or fishbones in their long\r\nears and flat noses,--all streaked with war-paint and all shouting\r\nlike madmen as they brandished their muskets and spears.\r\n\r\n\"They fired a volley which stretched on the earth the poor captain\r\nand all my shipmates dead or dying.  The latter they soon despatched\r\nwith their knives and spears, and left them to be eaten by wild\r\nanimals; but on finding that I had escaped their bullets, they\r\nsupposed that their Fetish had protected me, and so for a time I was\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\n\"For a whole week I was forced to help these savages in the work of\r\ntaking all that remained of the wreck to pieces, though hundreds came\r\nfrom the interior, and they wrought hard, some men using even their\r\nfiled teeth, to get all the iron and copper bolts, which they prized\r\nmore than the cargo, sails, or spars, as they could fashion them into\r\nweapons and the heads of spears and arrows.  But with every thing\r\nthey could lay their dingy hands upon, myself included, they made off\r\ninland, just as a vessel, which proved to be a King's ship, came\r\nround the Shark's Nose, and thus, with help, protection, and liberty\r\nat hand, I was more than ever a prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"I was in very low spirits, you may be sure, fearing they only\r\nintended to fatten me up, like a stall-fed ox, or a turtle in a tub,\r\nbefore cooking and eating me, or making me a sacrifice to some idol\r\ncarved of wood; for many times I saw the whole 'tarnal tribe on their\r\nknees before the figure head of the _Arrow_, which had been washed\r\nashore, and was pronounced to be a great Fetish.\r\n\r\n\"For three days we travelled among deep and slimy-green swamps, thick\r\nwild woods, and immense pathless canebrakes, where in an hour I saw\r\nmore tree-leopards and zebras, howling jackals and antelopes,\r\ngrinning monkeys and chattering paroquets, than ever were seen in all\r\nthe shows at Greenwich fair, till we arrived at a kraal of a hundred\r\nhuts, for all the world like pigsties, surrounded by a high palisade\r\nof bamboos, and situated in a forest of palms.\r\n\r\n\"I was now the slave of a chief, whose rigging was rather queer, for\r\nit consisted only of a deep fringe, or kilt, of unplaited grass, a\r\nnecklace of lion's teeth and fish-bones, and a cap of leopard's skin,\r\non which towered a plume of feathers, above a row of human teeth and\r\nsea-shells.\r\n\r\n\"Being rope-ended by an inch-and-half colt--aye, or keelhauled once a\r\nday from the foreyardarm--were jokes when compared to all this\r\nAfrican nigger made me undergo, while working for him under a blazing\r\nsun, in pestilent swamps, where the very air choked me, as if I had\r\nbeen in a ship with a foul hold, for the slime in these canebrakes\r\nwas as thick as tar and black as old bilge-water.\r\n\r\n\"One day he was soothing his excitement by beating me with a heavy\r\nbamboo, till my back and arms were covered with blood.  Close by were\r\na whole gang of the tribe squatted under a palm-tree, smoking\r\nhubble-bubbles made of nut shells, looking on and laughing at the\r\ntorture was undergoing; but in the midst of their sport we heard a\r\nroar that made our hearts tremble, and all ready to scamper off.\r\n\r\n\"There was a mighty crashing and swaying of the wild canes in the\r\nadjacent brake, and then a great square-headed and tawny-haired lion,\r\nas large as a good-sized pony, and with a tuft like a swab at the end\r\nof his switching tail, came plunging forward, with eyes flashing and\r\nhis red mouth open.\r\n\r\n\"Souse as a sheet anchor goes into the sea, he sprang upon my owner,\r\nand in the time I take to turn this quid, Master Rodney, that\r\ntroublesome personage was borne off into the jungle a bruised mass of\r\nbones and blood, dangling in his jaws.\r\n\r\n\"The whole thing passed like a flash of lightning!\r\n\r\n\"At first the niggers were about to pursue the lion, but upon\r\nreflection they thought it less dangerous to fall upon me and kill me\r\noutright, saying that my stupid cries had brought the wild animal\r\nupon them.  Then an old fellow, whose wool had become white with age,\r\nwho was coiled up in the root of a tree, where he generally berthed\r\nhimself, and who was considered a wise man, came forward and demanded\r\ntheir attention.  He had been a brave fellow in his time, for he wore\r\na row of human teeth at his neck, all strung on a lanyard, with a bit\r\nof an old quart bottle which he had found upon the beach, and wore as\r\na 'great medicine,' or order of the Garter perhaps.  He saved me by\r\nsaying, in their outlandish gibberish, that I was evidently under the\r\nprotection of the great Fetish, in honor of whom I should be made\r\nlike themselves, and handsomely tattooed.\r\n\r\n\"I might as well have hallooed to the wind in a tearing pampero or a\r\nstiff reef-topsail breeze, Master Rodney, as have attempted to oppose\r\nthis piece of Congo kindness.  In a minute I was hove down under the\r\nnasty black paws of five-and-forty howling and jabbering niggers, all\r\nsmearing me with palm-oil out of calabashes and old gallipots, and\r\nthey persisted in rubbing it into me till all my skin was nearly\r\npeeled off.\r\n\r\n\"Then the old Fetish-man who lived in the root of the tree, after\r\nmaking three summersets and uttering six howls, ornamented all my\r\nface, hands, and arms in this fashion, using a kind of knife, which\r\nhe dipped from time to time in some black stuff that he carried in a\r\ncocoanut-shell.  In ten minutes I was all over serpents and circles,\r\nstripes, pothooks and hangers!\r\n\r\n\"It went to my heart to have my beauty spoiled, but I was far past\r\nmaking any opposition, and so I have had to go through life in all\r\nweathers, with a face like the clown's in a pantomime.\r\n\r\n\"They made me so like a nigger that they scarcely knew me from one of\r\nthemselves.  This so favored my escape, that I soon found an\r\nopportunity of giving the Mussolongos the slip in the night, and made\r\na shift, after many a break-heart adventure, to reach a British\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n\"I remember well when, from a wild forest, I saw before me a long\r\nblue ridge.  It was the Sierra Leona--or the Mountain of the Lioness,\r\nas the niggers thereabout call it--the highest in North or South\r\nGuinea.  Glad was I, Master Rodney, to see the flag of Old England\r\nwaving on the fort and in the bay.  There was a sloop of war at\r\nanchor there, the _Active_; and when she fired the evening gun you\r\nwould have thought a whole fleet was saluting, there are so many\r\nechoing caves and dens in the mountains and along the shore.\r\n\r\n\"I soon made my way home to England, but was more laughed at than\r\npitied for my queer figure-head, which frightened some folks, my old\r\nmother especially, for she banged the door right in my face, and\r\ncalled for the police when I went to her old bunk at Deptford.\r\n\r\n\"However, I got used to all that sort of thing; but as folks are so\r\nill-bred and uncharitable ashore, I have left Deptford forever, and\r\nkeep always afloat, to be out of harm's way.  So that's the yarn of\r\nhow I became tattooed, Master Rodney.\"\r\n\r\n\"Finish the brandy-and-water, Tom,\" said I; \"and now we shall make a\r\nstart for the brig--noon is past, and the atmosphere cooler than it\r\nwas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your very good health.  Next time we splice the main-brace ashore, I\r\nhope it will be in Cuba,\" said Tom, finishing the contents of my\r\nflask, and then becoming so jovial that he broke at once into an old\r\nsea-song, the last two verses of which were somewhat to this purpose:\r\n\r\n  \"I learned to splice, to reef, and clew,\r\n  To drink my grog with the best of the crew,\r\n        And tell a merry story;\r\n  And though I wasn't very big,\r\n  Aloft I'd climb; nor care a fig\r\n  To stand by my gun, or dance a jig,\r\n        And all for Britain's glory!\r\n\r\n  \"When home I steered again, I found\r\n  My poor old mother run aground,\r\n        And doleful was her story;\r\n  She had been cheated by a lawyer elf,\r\n  Who married her for her old dad's pelf,\r\n  But spent it all, then hanged himself.\r\n        Hooray for Britain's glory.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nJust as Tom concluded this remarkable ditty, with tones that made the\r\nvolcanic grotto echo to \"glory,\" a voice that made us start,\r\nexclaimed close by us--\r\n\r\n\"Bueno!  Ha! ha!  Los Inglesos borrachios!\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing chis impertinent reflection on our sobriety, we both\r\nlooked up and saw--what the next chapter will tell you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nDANGEROUS COMPANY.\r\n\r\nBehind us stood eight fellows, five of whom had muskets, and three\r\nheavy bludgeons.  They were apparently Spanish seafaring men; but\r\nwhether contrabandistas of the lowest class, a portion of a slaver's\r\ncrew, or merely drunken brawlers, we could not at first determine.\r\nHowever, they soon made us aware that robbery was their object, and\r\nthat they were no way averse to a little homicide also, if we\r\ninterfered with their plans in the least.\r\n\r\nSome had their coarse, but glossy and intensely black hair, confined\r\nby nets or cauls; others had only Barcelona handkerchiefs round their\r\nheads.  The spots of blood upon these, together with several patches\r\nand discolored eyes, showed us that these modern Iberians had been\r\nfighting among themselves.  Their attire, which consisted only of red\r\nor blue shirts and dirty canvas trousers, was rather dilapidated; but\r\nsomething of the picturesque was imparted to it by the sashes of\r\nglaring red and yellow worsted which girt their waists, and in which\r\nthey had long knives stuck conspicuously.\r\n\r\nBy their bearing, their dark glaring eyes, their muscular figures,\r\ntheir bare arms, chests, and feet, their bronzed, sallow, and ugly\r\nvisages,--and more than all, by their rags, which were redolent of\r\ngarlic and coarse tobacco, it was evident that we had fallen into\r\nunpleasant society.  Several had silver rings in their ears, and on\r\nthe bare chest of one, I saw a crucifix marked either with ink or\r\ngunpowder.\r\n\r\nThese fellows had come from the inner or back part of the cavern,\r\nwhere they had evidently been observing us for some time before they\r\nso suddenly appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Acqu'ardiente,\" said one, approvingly, as he applied his fierce\r\nhooked nose to my empty flask, and then placed it in his pocket.  A\r\nsecond snatched away my courier-bag, and a third appropriated my\r\ntelescope, which he stuck in his sash.\r\n\r\nTaking up a stone which lay at hand, I was about to hurl it at the\r\nhead of the latter when the muzzle of a cocked musket pointed to my\r\nbreast, and the butt of another applied roughly to my back,\r\nadmonished me that discretion was the better part of valor.\r\n\r\n\"El page de escoba--ha, ha!\" (the cabin boy), said one\r\ncontemptuously, as he examined my attire--a smart blue jacket, with\r\ngilt anchor buttons, which Hislop had given me.  My porte-monnaie,\r\nwhich contained only a few shillings, and my gold watch, a present\r\ngiven to me by my mother when I went to Eton, were soon taken from\r\nme.  As for poor Tom, he possessed only a brass tobacco-box, a short\r\nblack pipe, and one shilling and sixpence; yet he was speedily\r\ndeprived of them by one who seemed to be the leader of the gang.\r\n\r\n\"You rascally Jack Spaniard!\" said Tom, shaking his clenched fist in\r\nthe robber's face, \"if ever I haul alongside of you elsewhere, look\r\nout for squalls!\"\r\n\r\nAt this they all laughed; and seizing us by the arms, dragged us into\r\nthe back part of the cavern or fissure in the rocks, leaving one of\r\ntheir number, armed with a musket, as sentinel, at the entrance,\r\nwhere he lit a paper cigar, and stretching himself on the grassy\r\nbank, placed his hands under his head, and proceeded leisurely to\r\nsmoke in the sunshine.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings filled us with great alarm; now that they had\r\nrobbed us of everything save our clothes, what could their object be?\r\n\r\nOne of them produced two pieces of rope, with which our hands were\r\ntied.  Dragged by some, and receiving severe blows and bruises from\r\nthe clenched hands and musket-butts of others--accompanied by the\r\nimprecations and coarse laughter of all--we were conveyed through a\r\nlow-roofed grotto, or natural gallery in the rocks, the echoes of\r\nwhich repeated their voices with a thousand reverberations.\r\n\r\nThe only light here was by the reflection of the sunshine at the\r\nentrance, where the basalt was coated by a white substance, the\r\n_débris_ of some old volcanic eruption; for _the slope_, up which we\r\nhad been ascending all the morning, formed a portion of the great\r\nPeak.  And now we became sensible of a strange sound and a strange\r\nodor pervading all the place.\r\n\r\nThrough a rent in the rocky roof of the grotto there fell a clear\r\nbright stream of sunlight, that revealed the terrors of the place\r\ntoward which our captors dragged us.\r\n\r\nOn one side there yawned a vast black fissure or chasm in the sombre\r\nmasses of glassy obsidian and red blocks of lava which composed the\r\nfloor of that horrid cavern; and from this fissure there ascended,\r\nand doubtless still ascends at times, a hot sulphureous steam, which\r\nrendered breathing difficult, and induced an inclination to sneeze.\r\n\r\nFrom the depth of that hideous chasm, the profundity of which no\r\nmortal eye could measure, and no human being could contemplate\r\nwithout awe and terror, we heard a strange, buzzing sound, as if from\r\nthe bowels of the inner earth, far--heaven alone knew how far--down\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nIn fact, we were upon the verge of one of those natural spiracles\r\nwhich the natives term \"the Nostrils,\" or avenues through which the\r\nhot vapors of that tremendous Piton ascend; and the buzzing sound\r\nthat made our hearts shrink, we scarcely knew why, was caused by some\r\nvolcanic throe at the bottom of the mountain, whose base is many a\r\nmile below the waters of the sea.\r\n\r\nThis fissure was almost twelve feet broad, and across it there lay a\r\nplank, forming a species of bridge.\r\n\r\nTwo of our captors crossed, and then ordered us to follow them.\r\n\r\nI obeyed like one in a dream; but my heart was chilled by a terror so\r\ndeadly that I had no power or thought of resistance.  My first fear\r\nwas that the plank might be trundled from under our feet, and that we\r\nwould be launched into the black abyss below; but such was not the\r\nobject of these Spaniards, as Tom and I were permitted to pass in\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the thieves followed, and we found ourselves in\r\nanother grotto, the roof of which was covered by stalactites, that\r\nglittered like gothic pendants of alabaster in the light that fell\r\nfrom the upper fissure, which formed a natural window, and through it\r\nwe could see the thin white steam ascending and curling in the\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nNow, supposing that they had us in perfect security, our captors\r\nproceeded to hold a consultation as to what they should do with us;\r\nand imagining that we were both ignorant of their language, or what\r\nis more probable, caring little whether we knew it or not, they\r\ncanvassed the most terrible resolutions with perfect coolness and\r\nfreedom of speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE VENTANA.\r\n\r\nTom Lambourne's face wore somewhat of a blanched hue, through which\r\nthe stripes of his tattooing seemed blacker than ever.  A severe cut\r\non his forehead, from which the blood was oozing, did not add to his\r\npersonal appearance.  He scarcely knew a word of Spanish, but seemed\r\ninstinctively aware that we had fallen into hands nearly as dangerous\r\nas his former acquaintances the Mussolongos, for he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Master Rodney, I fear we have run our last knot off the log-line,\r\nand our sand-glass won't run again, unless heaven gives the order _to\r\nturn_.  Yet, if I could but get one of these muskets, to have a shot\r\nat the rascally cargo-puddlers before it's all over with us, I would\r\nbe content.  As it is, I am all over blood from clew to ear-ring, and\r\nthey have wellnigh choked me by shaking a quid down my throat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush, Tom,\" said I, for I was listening to a discussion which took\r\nplace among the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\"Do you understand their lingo?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are they saying?\" he asked, with growing interest.\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you immediately.\"\r\n\r\nBut as they all spoke at once in the sonorous Spanish of the\r\nCatalonian coast, mingled with obscure slang and nautical phrases,\r\nsome time elapsed before I could understand them.  Meanwhile, how\r\nterrible were the thoughts that filled my mind.\r\n\r\nIf these fellows murdered and cast us into that awful chasm, the deed\r\nwould never be known; until the day of doom, our fate and our remains\r\ncould no more be traced than the smoke that melts into the sky.  Even\r\nif we escaped unhurt, but were detained so long that the brig sailed\r\nwithout us, what would be our condition, penniless, forlorn, and\r\nunknown, in that foreign island?  But this was a minor evil.\r\n\r\nThen I burned to revenge the lawless treatment to which we were\r\nsubjected, and the blows and bruises their cowardly hands had dealt\r\nso freely.\r\n\r\n\"Companeros,\" I heard one say, \"one of these fellows is tattooed, and\r\nwould sell very well to the South American planters with the rest\r\nthat will soon be under hatches.  He is worth keeping, if he cannot\r\nransom himself; as for the _other_----\"\r\n\r\n\"_El muchaco!_\" (the boy) said they, glancing at me.\r\n\r\n\"Si--el page de escoba--if he is allowed to return, a complaint may\r\nfind its way to the Senor Alcalde, whose alguazils may come and\r\nborrow our topsails and anchor for a time; whereas, if we heave him\r\nwhere the others went yesterday----\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Into the ventana, hombre!\" was the fierce response; \"and then no\r\nmore will be heard of the affair.\"\r\n\r\nMy blood grew cold at these words, and I scarcely knew what followed,\r\ntill the first man who spoke came forward and addressed us.\r\n\r\n\"Inglesos,\" said he, \"we have decided that one of you, after swearing\r\nnot to reveal our present hiding-place, shall return within four\r\nhours, bearing a fitting ransom for both, else, so surely as the\r\nclock strikes, he who is left behind goes into the ventana of the\r\nmountain, where never did the longest deep-sea line find a\r\nbottom--not that I suppose any man was ever ass enough to try.\r\nSantos! do you hear?\" he added, striking his musket-butt sharply on\r\nthe rocks, when perceiving that Tom was ignorant of all he said, and\r\nthat I was stupefied by it.\r\n\r\n\"Si, senor,\" said I, and translated it to Tom Lambourne, who twirled\r\nhis tarry hat on his fore-finger, stuck his quid in his cheek,\r\nslapped his thigh vigorously, and gave other nautical manifestations\r\nof extreme surprise and discomposure.\r\n\r\n\"Ransom, Master Rodney?\" he reiterated; \"in the name of old Davy, who\r\nwould ransom a poor Jack like me?\"\r\n\r\n\"The whole crew would table their month's wages on the capstan\r\nhead--aye, in a moment, Tom,\" I replied with confidence.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure they would, and the Captain and Master Hislop, too, for the\r\nmatter o' that, rather than poor shipmates should come to harm;\r\nbut----\"\r\n\r\n\"As for _me_,\" said I, with growing confidence, \"I am, as you said,\r\nsenores, only the page de escoba.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said the Spaniard, grinning, and showing a row of sharp white\r\nteeth, under a dirty and sable moustache; \"though I said so, I knew\r\nbetter.  A shipboy seldom has a watch like _this_,\" he added,\r\ndisplaying my gold repeater.  \"Now, we shall keep _you_; and if this\r\nseaman--after he has first sworn that he will not betray us--does not\r\nreturn to us here with five hundred dollars within two hours after\r\nsunset, _par el_\"--(here he made a dreadful vow in Spanish), \"we will\r\ntoss you like a dead dog into the ventana of the mountain.  Look\r\ndown, and see what a journey is before you,\" he added, with a\r\ndiabolical smile, as he dragged me to the beetling edge of the chasm,\r\nand forced me to look into it.\r\n\r\nOur eyes had now become so accustomed to the light of the gallery or\r\ngrotto, that the rays of sunshine falling through the fissure above\r\nus were sufficient to disclose a portion of the vast profundity on\r\nthe verge of which we stood.\r\n\r\nFrom the earth's womb, far, far down below, there came upward a\r\nchoking steam, with a hollow buzzing sound, which deepened at times\r\nto a rumble.\r\n\r\nThis steam or mist rose and fell on the currents of air; sometimes it\r\nsank so low that nothing but a black and dreary void met the eye,\r\nwhich ached in attempting to pierce it.  Anon the steam would rise in\r\nspiral curls from that gloomy bed below, where doubtless the fires of\r\nthe now almost extinct volcano seethe their embers in the waves of\r\nthe ocean.\r\n\r\nThe words \"have mercy,\" were on my lips, but I could not utter them;\r\nnor would they have availed me.  Ignorant of what the ruffian said,\r\nand believing he was about to thrust me in, poor Tom Lambourne, in\r\nthe fulness of his heart, uttered a howl of dismay; and at that\r\nmoment the sentinel, whom the gang had left at the entrance to their\r\nlurking-place, came hurriedly in, with alarm expressed in his\r\nglittering eyes, and a finger placed, as a warning, on his hairy lip.\r\n\r\n\"Para!  Paz!  Silenzio!\" (hold--peace--silence), he exclaimed, and\r\nadded that four officers from the garrison of Santa Cruz had\r\ndismounted in the ravine, unbitted their horses, and had seated\r\nthemselves under a tree to smoke.\r\n\r\nThis information was received by the band with oaths and mutterings\r\nof impatience; and by us with mingled emotions of hope and\r\nagony--hope that they might be the means of our escape or rescue; and\r\nagony to know that such means were so near, and yet could avail us\r\nnothing; for on the slightest sound being made by either of us, there\r\nwere the Albacete knives of our captors on one hand, and the\r\nventana--that awful ventana--on the other, to insure forever the\r\nsilence and oblivion of the grave.\r\n\r\nNot the least of my sufferings was from the cord which secured my\r\nwrists.  Already the skin was swollen, cut, and bleeding in\r\nconsequence of the tightness with which these wretches had bound me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO OUR ADVENTURE.\r\n\r\nFor two hours--they seemed an eternity to me--it would appear, the\r\nfour Spanish officers lingered over their wine-flasks and cigars in\r\nthe wooded ravine, their movements being duly reported from time to\r\ntime by one of the outlaws, who stole to the cavern mouth and peeped\r\nout.\r\n\r\nAt last, they mounted and rode off, when a fresh cause for wrath and\r\ndelay was produced by the announcement that a wagon, drawn by mules\r\nand attended by several laborers and negroes, had broken down on the\r\nroad about a mile distant.\r\n\r\nThe irritation of our Spaniards--some of whom spoke of having a ship\r\nto join--was now so great, that I feared they might end the whole\r\naffair by disposing of us in a summary manner.\r\n\r\nThis wagon being heavily laden caused a delay for several hours.  The\r\nsun's rays ceased to shine through the fissure above us; the grotto\r\ngrew dark by the increase of imperceptible shadows; the dingy faces\r\nof our olive-skinned detainers grew darker still; and their\r\nimpatience was only surpassed by ours, for we, too, had a ship to\r\nrejoin.\r\n\r\nEvery minute of these hours--every second of every minute--passed\r\nslowly, like a pang of agony in my heart; and every feature of that\r\nnatural vault, through which the dying daylight stole--with the faces\r\nand voices of the men whose victims we were, and more than all, the\r\nceaseless and eternal buzz in the dark chasm that yawned close\r\nby--the ventana, or nostril of the Piton--are yet vividly impressed\r\nupon my memory.\r\n\r\nAt last the darkness was so great, that a lantern was lighted, and\r\nits wavering gleams, as they fell on the crystals, the spar, quartz,\r\nand glassy blocks of black obsidian and ruddy lava which formed the\r\nwalls and arch of the cavern, on the dark ferocious visages, the\r\ngaudy sashes, the naked arms and feet, the scrubby black beards, and\r\nbrass-mounted knives, and muskets of the taciturn Spaniards, who sat\r\nin a sullen group smoking paper cigaritos,--all added to the gloomy\r\nbut picturesque horror of the place and of the incident.\r\n\r\n\"Antonio, que hora es?\" I heard one say, inquiring the time.\r\n\r\n\"Las neuve y media, companero mio\" (half-past nine), replied the\r\npossessor of my gold watch, which he consulted with considerable\r\ncomplacency.\r\n\r\n\"Maldita!\" growled the others, knitting their brows, for the dusk was\r\nrapidly becoming darkness, and they had no desire for killing us, if\r\nwe could be made profitable.  I have often thought since, that had\r\nTom actually procured and returned with the required ransom of five\r\nhundred dollars, they would have pocketed it and then killed us\r\nboth--me most certainly, as they seemed to have other views for poor\r\nTom in the Southern States.\r\n\r\n\"We have had a long spell of this,\" said he, in a low voice.  \"I am\r\ngoing to escape, if I can.\"\r\n\r\n\"Escape! but how?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know exactly _how_, yet; but we must first have our lashings\r\ncast off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would to Heaven they were, Tom.  My hands are so swollen, and my\r\nwrists so cut and benumbed, that my arms are wellnigh powerless,\" I\r\nwhispered in a low voice, like a groan.\r\n\r\n\"Sit with me here, in the shadow of this angle of rock; and now, as\r\nthe darkness is fairly set in, I shall soon make you free.\"\r\n\r\nBy a rapid and skilful application of his strong teeth to the cord\r\nwhich bound my wrists, he untwisted the knot and freed my hands; and\r\nthen in the suddenly-given luxury of being able to stretch my arms, I\r\nalmost forgot the necessity for concealing the fact that I was now\r\nunbound.\r\n\r\nI soon found an opportunity for untying Tom's fetters.  Then we kept\r\nour hands clasped before us, as if still manacled, and watched,\r\nwaited, and hoped--we scarcely knew for what--while in the further\r\nend of this inner cave, our detainers sat sullenly smoking, and, by\r\nthe dim lantern light, making up cigaritos from their\r\ntobacco-pouches, and those little rice-paper books which are now\r\nprocurable nearly everywhere.\r\n\r\nFrom the conversation of our captors, I could gather that our brig,\r\nthe _Eugenie_, was visible at anchor in the roadstead of Santa Cruz,\r\na mile or so distant.\r\n\r\nThree of these Spaniards had placed their muskets against the wall of\r\nrock, and seemed disposed to doze off asleep.\r\n\r\nClose by us lay the plank which crossed that dread ventana, like the\r\ninfernal bridge of Poulsherro, which the Mahommedans believe crosses\r\nthe sea of fire that on the day of doom shall separate Good from\r\nEvil.  Tom and I looked at it, and exchanged glances of intelligence\r\nfrom time to time, but the attempt to rush across might prove doubly\r\nfatal to one or both.  A slip of the foot would hurl us into\r\neternity; and if the passage were achieved, we would be exposed to\r\nthe fire of those we fled from, and met by that of the armed man at\r\nthe mouth of the grotto.\r\n\r\nThus our position and its perils were somewhat complicated.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the distant report of a piece of ordnance, coming from the\r\nseaward, made us all look up and listen.\r\n\r\n\"El ruido que hace el canon!\" (the crack of a gun), exclaimed a\r\nSpaniard, scrambling up to the lower end of the fissure in the arch\r\nof the grotto, and looking out.\r\n\r\n\"We all know that well enough; but what does it mean?\" asked the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\"The English brig at the anchorage has fired it.  I see a light\r\nglittering on her deck; and now away it goes up to the foremast head.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is the _Eugenie_, Master Rodney,\" whispered Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Can the captain be about to sail to-night,--and without us?\" said I,\r\nwith growing dismay.\r\n\r\n\"No; but he is impatient for us to come off.  He knows well what a\r\n'tarnal slippery set of imps these Jack Spaniards are, and has shown\r\na light, and fired a gun as a hint for us to look sharp.\"\r\n\r\n\"Companero,\" said one of the Spaniards to the other who was looking\r\nout, \"are you sure that it is the English brig, and not ours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but by St. Paul! there is a light burning now on the Castello\r\nde Santa Cruz; so our craft had better get her sweeps out, and put to\r\nsea, even without us.  Can the Senor Gobernador have smelt a rat?\"\r\n\r\nThis announcement, though we knew not what it referred to, had an\r\nevident effect on our captors, who were probably part of a slaver's\r\ncrew; for they all scrambled up to the opening in the rocks to look\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\"Now, now is the time to slip our cables and run.  Follow me!\" said\r\nTom Lambourne, in a hoarse but determined whisper, as he sprang\r\nforward--snatched up two of the muskets, and rushed across the plank,\r\ntripping as lightly as he would have done along a boom or yard,\r\nthough it crossed a gulf so terrible.\r\n\r\nLess steadily, but not less rapidly, you may be assured--yet with a\r\nfrozen heart--I followed him, and his hard tarry hand was ready to\r\ngrasp mine and drag me forward into safety, while with a violent kick\r\nhe tossed the plank away, and surging down it went, into the black\r\ngulf we had crossed.\r\n\r\nIt vanished in a moment, and no sound ever ascended, for it seemed to\r\nhave fallen into a pit that was dark as it was bottomless!\r\n\r\n\"Take this musket, and see that you can use it, sir,\" said Tom, as an\r\nemotion of bravado seized him.  \"And so, you Spanish greenhorns,\" he\r\nshouted, \"you thought to sell me for a nigger to the Yankees, did\r\nyou?  Whoop--hurrah!\"\r\n\r\nA volley of Spanish oaths followed this rash outburst, which drew\r\ntheir attention at once upon us.  Some rushed to the dark brink and\r\npaused, I suppose, for neither Tom nor I could see distinctly, as\r\nthere was a double explosion which filled the cavern with echoes like\r\nthose of rolling thunder, and a momentary glare of smoky light, while\r\ntwo musket-balls whistled past us; and I felt one like a hot cinder,\r\nas it grazed my left ear.  Then came an Albacete knife, which was\r\nhurled by no erring hand, for it wounded Tom's right knee.\r\n\r\n\"Give them a shot, Mr. Rodney,\" said he, furiously; \"I'll reserve my\r\nfire for the sentry,--and here he is already!\"\r\n\r\nAnd just as the eighth fellow, who was on the watch, alarmed by the\r\nfiring, came rushing in with his piece at full cock, Tom fired at him.\r\n\r\n\"Saints and angels!\" yelled the Spaniard, as he bounded into the air,\r\nand then fell flat on his face, where he lay beating the earth with\r\nhis feet and hands.\r\n\r\n\"Fire! fire!  Master Rodney, and then run for it, before they can\r\nreload,\" cried Tom, who saw that I was irresolute; \"give 'em a stern\r\nchaser!\"\r\n\r\nMy blood was now fairly up.  Wheeling round, I levelled full at the\r\ngroup, one of whom was in the act of _taking aim at me_; while I saw\r\nthe steel ram-rod of the other, who had a musket, glitter in the\r\nlantern light as he reloaded.\r\n\r\nI fired!  I know not whether the ball hit; but one of the ruffians\r\nsprang wildly forward, and fell headlong into the ventana!\r\n\r\n\"That will do!\" cried Tom; \"away now, as fast as we can--stretch\r\nout--bear away for the harbor and the brig!\"\r\n\r\nGrasping our newly-acquired weapons, which we never thought of\r\nrelinquishing, we rushed out, and descending the ravine, favored by\r\nthe starlight, instinctively took the path which led directly to the\r\nharbor.\r\n\r\nWith a heart that beat wildly, a head in a whirl of thoughts, and\r\nevery pulse quickened by the whole affair--by the ferocious treatment\r\nto which we had been subjected for so many hours; by the perils which\r\nhad menaced us; by the narrow escapes we had made from bullets, and\r\nwhen twice crossing that awful chasm; by the wild and disastrous\r\ntragedy which closed the adventures of a long and exciting day,--I\r\nran beside Tom Lambourne; on, on, without a breath to spare or a word\r\nto utter.\r\n\r\nHeadlong we stumbled over piles of old lava, now we sank ankle deep\r\namong soft pumice dust; anon we rolled, fell, or scrambled through\r\nwild vines and creepers; then through fields of growing maize and\r\nwheat, or plantations of coffee and apple trees; but never paused\r\nuntil we reached the base of the mighty Piton, where, breathless,\r\ngasping, panting, and bathed in perspiration, we lay down in a little\r\nthicket of cinnamon bushes by the wayside, to rest for a short space.\r\n\r\nDuring this flight I had never spoken, but Tom from time to time\r\nindulged in disjointed remarks expressive of an exultation in which I\r\ncould not share, being only thankful to heaven for my escape.  But\r\npoor Tom had seen more of a rough life, and of many a violent death,\r\nthan it could possibly have been my lot to witness.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha! you Spanish swabs!  We've slung two of your hammocks in a\r\nhot place--before the time, perhaps!\" said he.  \"What a row they\r\nmade, like so many niggers clearing a cargo, when we sheered off!\r\nLucky it was that I eased off our tow-lines in time!  I have a good\r\nmind to put about, stand for the cave, and pot another of those\r\nSpanish gorillas!\"\r\n\r\nWhether he meant _guerillas_ I did not inquire, but was happy when we\r\nreached the harbor, and I felt the cool breeze of the ocean fan my\r\nthrobbing temples and my hands, which, from being so long and so\r\ntightly tied with rough cords, and having the blood afterwards driven\r\nthrough them by rapid exertion, felt literally burning _hot_.\r\n\r\nAll was dark and still when we ran along the stone mole of Santa\r\nCruz.  Fortunately, at that late hour, there were no officials to\r\nquestion or molest us; and we could see the brig anchored about half\r\na mile distant, with the lantern still burning at the foremasthead.\r\nThe light on the Castle had disappeared.\r\n\r\nWe soon found a small punt at the landing stairs, and taking\r\npossession of it without leave, cast loose the painter and shoved off.\r\n\r\nSilently and steadily, with all our remaining strength we pulled for\r\nthe brig, and were soon alongside.\r\n\r\n\"Well, this spree is over, Master Rodney,\" said Tattooed Tom, wiping\r\nhis brow with his sleeve when we stood on the deck, where the\r\nwondering crew gathered round us; \"but catch me having another in\r\nthis deuced Tenny Reef,--that's all!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE ANCHOR A-PEAK.\r\n\r\nAlarmed by the foregoing narrative, which was fully corroborated by\r\nour excitement, by the two muskets we had brought on board as\r\ntrophies, by the state of our hands and wrists, and the numerous cuts\r\nand bruises we had upon us; and fearing the consequent detention of\r\nthe brig for some legal inquiry, Captain Weston prepared at once for\r\nputting to sea.\r\n\r\nI was happy when finding myself on the deck of the _Eugenie_, but\r\nstill more supremely happy on hearing Weston's resolution to get\r\nunder way, as I possessed very vague but decidedly unpleasant ideas\r\nof Spanish justice, and had visions of alcaldes, alguazils, wheels,\r\ngarottes, and even the masked familiars of the Inquisition itself,\r\nfloating before me.\r\n\r\nMy heart beat responsive to the clank of the windlass pawls, as the\r\n_Eugenie_ was hove short on her anchor, and the hands started aloft\r\nto cast loose the topsails.\r\n\r\nWeston threw our two muskets into the sea, lest their discovery on\r\nboard might cause suspicion or annoyance.\r\n\r\nThe morning was clear, cool, and starry; and yet no vestige of dawn\r\nwas visible, and all was still and quiet on shore; but I was in\r\nmomentary expectation of seeing a boat dash off toward us, though\r\nthose from whom we had escaped could have no just cause of complaint.\r\n\r\nSuddenly I heard the sound of oars, and saw a long, low boat shoot\r\nout from the obscurity of the harbor.  My heart stood still for a\r\nmoment as this craft was steered in our direction, but to my infinite\r\nrelief it boarded a Costa Rican that lay near us.\r\n\r\nAs yet the shadows of night were on land and sea,--on every thing\r\nsave the cone of the Peak that towered above the clouds, and there\r\nshone the light of the yet unrisen sun, yellow deepening into\r\nsaffron, purple, blue, and then indigo, blending with the blackness\r\nof night as the eye descended to the shore.\r\n\r\nSo Weston gave the order to brace the foreyards aback and the\r\nmainyards full; another wrench at the windlass and the anchor was\r\ntripped.\r\n\r\n\"Heave and a-wash!\" cried Tom Lambourne, cheerily, giving the usual\r\ncall of encouragement, when the dripping anchor-ring is just out of\r\nthe water, and the stock is seen to stir the surface.\r\n\r\nThe courses were let fall and the gib was hoisted; her head fell\r\nrapidly round and she payed off bravely.  Then the fiery cone of the\r\nPiton and the lights of Santa Cruz which had glittered in tremulous\r\nlines along the water on our beam were shining upon our lee quarter.\r\n\r\n\"Fill away the headyards--handsomely now!\" cried Weston, and just as\r\nthe first streak of day, coming on with tropical rapidity, began to\r\nbrighten the horizon, and shed long shiny ripples on the sea, the\r\ncanvas swelled out, the reef points began to patter on the taut bosom\r\nof every snow-white sail, and the loose rigging was blown out in\r\ngraceful bends.\r\n\r\nThere was a fine breeze rising; the white water rippled under the\r\nforefoot of the _Eugenie_, and soon it boiled in foam as we sheeted\r\nhome the topsails and ran along the western shore of the mountain\r\nisle.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Costa Rican brig which was at anchor nearer\r\nthe shore (a smart craft she was, straight in the bends and all\r\nblack, save a yellow streak), also got ready for sea with great\r\nexpedition and worked out of the harbor; and when the hot sun, which\r\nerewhile had lit up the vast continent of Africa to the eastward of\r\nus rose from the ocean, we saw her black hull and white canvas\r\nshining in his morning rays about a mile astern.\r\n\r\n\"You say, Marc, that craft is a Costa Rican?\" said Weston, doubtfully.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Hislop.\r\n\r\n\"She may be, but she is also a Spanish dealer in black cattle,\" said\r\nWeston, who was looking at her through a powerful double-barrelled\r\nglass.  \"I am certain if you could only see her deck when she careens\r\na bit, you would make out the ring-bolts for lashing the slaves to in\r\nfine weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, and perhaps those for the carronades too,\" added Hislop; \"she\r\nlooks rather rakish.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are just of my mind, sir,\" added Tom Lambourne, who was at the\r\nwheel.  \"She'll see the Shark's Nose and the Congo river before she\r\nsees the Mosquito creeks or the hills of Costa Rica; and I have a\r\nshrewd notion that the pirates we escaped from last night are part of\r\nher crew, if one may judge from what Master Rodney, who knows their\r\nlingo, overheard them say.\"\r\n\r\nExcept across the Peak of Teneriffe, where a cloud of white vapor\r\nfloated in mid-air like a permanent cymar or girdle, and above which\r\nsome thousand feet of the mighty cone towered into the blue immensity\r\nof space, mellowing from green and purple to a faint-gray tint, the\r\nsky was without a cloud.\r\n\r\nThe waves danced and sparkled in the morning sunshine, the fresh\r\nbreeze swept pleasantly over their whitening tops and whistled\r\nthrough our rigging, as we ran along the shore with considerable\r\nspeed; and now our hearts beat lightly, for the broad free ocean was\r\naround us, and on clearing the dangerous rocks at Punta de Anaga by\r\ngiving them a wide berth, we felt the heavier swell of the Atlantic\r\nas we brought the larboard tacks on board, and ran, close-hauled, on\r\na taut bowline between the Isles of Teneriffe and Palma, keeping the\r\nweathergage of the Costa Rican, and leaving her at the same time fast\r\nand far astern.\r\n\r\nWe had a delightful run through the fertile Archipelago of the\r\nFortunate Isles, and after clearing San Josef, found the wind come\r\nmore aft.  Long after night had closed in, and darkness had enveloped\r\nall the sea and the isle of Teneriffe, the cone of the Peak shone\r\nredly in mid-air, with the light of the sun that had set in the\r\nwestern waters of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nFor the whole of that day we had run fast through the water, making\r\nat least seven knots an hour off the log-line, but midnight came\r\nbefore we saw the last of the mighty Peak of Adam.\r\n\r\nBy that time the wind was fair, and we bore merrily away for the\r\nIsles of the West.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nAN INCIDENT.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had been a month at sea, having applied myself\r\nassiduously to work, I picked up a little knowledge of seamanship.  I\r\ntook my turn of watch with the rest; I learned to go aloft and to lay\r\nout upon a yard in a stiff topgallant breeze.  I acquired all the\r\nmysteries of knotting and splicing, of serving a rope with spun-yarn,\r\nand to know the technical difference between the _rope_ itself and a\r\nline.  I could heave the log, box the compass, and take my \"trick\" at\r\nthe helm with the best man on board, and thus gained the golden\r\nopinions of those among whom a rough turn of the wheel of fortune had\r\nso strangely and so suddenly cast me.\r\n\r\nSome days after leaving the Canaries, we found ourselves passing\r\nthrough what seemed to be immense meadows of green stuff adrift.  By\r\nmoonlight the branches, leaves, and fibres of this uprooted marine\r\nforest,--for such it was, being wrack and seaweeds of wondrous length\r\nspringing from the lowest depths of the ocean--sparkled, flashed, and\r\nwhirled in the foaming eddies astern of the brig as she cleft or\r\nbrushed down the yielding masses with her rushing keel.\r\n\r\nI was never weary of surveying this scene, which was so marvellous in\r\nits beauty, when the moon was shining on the sea.\r\n\r\nThese vast broad leaves and long snaky tendrils that danced upon the\r\nsurface of the sea were the Florida gulf-weed.\r\n\r\n\"The tropical grape of the sailors,\" said Hislop, as we leaned over\r\nthe lee-quarter one evening.  \"These plants grow upon the two great\r\nbanks of the Atlantic, and were known to the Phoenicians, who named\r\nthem the Weedy Sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember,\" said I; \"and that the seamen of Columbus thought they\r\nwere sent by heaven to stay their course.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" replied the mate, with an approving smile.  \"It is\r\npleasant to meet one like you, Rodney, who has read that which is\r\nworth reading and remembers it.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Gulf Stream,\" said Weston, joining in the conversation, \"is a\r\ngreat current about sixty miles broad, caused by the trade winds,\r\nwhich always blow from east to west.  It issues from the Gulf between\r\nCape Florida and Cuba, and runs at the rate of three knots an hour\r\nalong the shores of South and North America, till the Newfoundland\r\nbank turns it to the south-east; so everywhere its track is known by\r\nthat gulf-weed which you now see floating past.\"\r\n\r\nIt is by this mysterious current--this mighty river that traverses\r\nthe ocean--that the timber logs of the St. Lawrence, the wrecks of\r\nthe old plate argosies, and the carved idols of older Mexico and the\r\nCaribbean Isles, all covered with the weeds and barnacles of long\r\nimmersion, have been cast upon the western shores of Scotland and the\r\nHebrides.\r\n\r\nEvery morning the weather became warmer--the sea and sky more\r\nclear--the atmosphere more rarefied.  The wind was so steady that\r\nscarcely a sheet or tack were altered.  Thus for several days we bore\r\non with both sheets aft, as the phrase is, when running right before\r\nthe wind.\r\n\r\nShoals of porpoises plunged across the bows of the brig in the\r\nsapphire-colored sea, and when it was smooth a whole fleet of the\r\nlittle nautilus passed us with purple sails up; nor were the dark and\r\ngliding shark and the silvery flying-fish wanting at times to keep my\r\nattention excited; and the tiny petrels, as they came tripping along,\r\nhalf in water and half in air; kept pace with the _Eugenie_, as she\r\ncracked on under a press of sail, dashing the waves around her,\r\nploughing so freely and so fearlessly the deep waters that hide a\r\nfinny world, and wash the dark and unknown basements of the earth.\r\n\r\nOne glorious morning, when we were within a few days' sail of\r\nHispaniola, there occurred a circumstance which was afterwards a\r\nsource of the deepest regret to us all; how and why, will be shown\r\nduring the progress of my story.\r\n\r\nThe day was fine, even for that region of fine days.  The _Eugenie_\r\nwas running smoothly before the wind, and Hislop, with considerable\r\nanimation, was detailing to the captain and me the appearance of that\r\nrare phenomenon, a lunar rainbow, which by singular good fortune he\r\nhad once seen in these latitudes, and which Aristotle declares is\r\nnever seen but at the time of the full moon,--a declaration which our\r\nlearned Scotch mate treated with contempt; for he was a strange\r\nfellow, this Marc Hislop, and could with equal facility dilate on the\r\nApology of Plato, and the method of club-hauling a square-rigged\r\nvessel, or sheering her to her anchor in a gale of wind; on the\r\nPrometheus of Æschylus, or the proper mode of lying too in a\r\nhurricane, with every thing struck aloft, and topsail yards on the\r\ncap; and now, on the subject of the lunar rainbow, he was proceeding\r\nto quote from the Portuguese Pilot of Ramusio, when Weston\r\ninterrupted him by hailing aloft.\r\n\r\n\"Fore-top--there!\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, aye, sir,\" was the usual response from Ned Carlton, a seaman\r\nwho was perched in the top.\r\n\r\n\"What are you about?\" asked Weston, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Greasing the sling of the fore-yard, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh--I thought you were making hay, you are so slow about it.  You\r\nhave been staring ahead for the last twenty minutes at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I think I see something,\" said the seaman, annoyed by the\r\nnautical taunt.\r\n\r\n\"Something,\" reiterated Weston, \"what is it? a church, or a windmill\r\ngoing before the wind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Neither, sir,--but a boat adrift.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does it bear, Ned?\" asked Hislop, starting into the rigging.\r\n\r\n\"On the starboard bow, about two miles off.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this the telescope was resorted to, and we could plainly\r\nenough see a white object, which the intervening waves, as they rose\r\nand fell, hid from us at times; and there was a great diversity of\r\nopinion, for one of the crew maintained it was a harbor buoy adrift.\r\n\r\n\"It must have drifted a long way to have come here,\" retorted\r\nCarlton; \"and if you have your grandmother's spectacles about you,\r\nwipe them clean, put them on, and look again,--for I can see plainly\r\nenough that it is a boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we shall overhaul it,\" said Weston; \"Hislop, prepare to lower\r\nours, and to lay the fore-yard aback.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Eugenie's_ course was shaped toward it, and when within a\r\nquarter of a mile, the foresail was laid to the mast, the brig hove\r\nin the wind, and the stern boat lowered; Hislop, Tom Lambourne, two\r\nother hands, and I, manned her, and put off to inspect and report\r\nupon what we could discover.  And so, with many surmises as to\r\nwrecks, boats getting adrift or being washed away from their davits,\r\nand so forth, we pulled swiftly toward her, all stripped to our\r\nshirtsleeves, for a hot West Indian sun was blazing in a cloudless\r\nsky, and the air seemed still and breathless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nANTONIO EL CUBANO.\r\n\r\nAs the strange boat pitched about on the waves some of our men\r\nasserted that, at times, they could see a man's head above the\r\ngunwale.  Others expressed their doubts of this, and in the midst of\r\nsuch discussions we sheered alongside.  Hislop caught its bow by the\r\nboat-hook, and while retaining his hold, fended off, to prevent her\r\nbeing dashed against ours.\r\n\r\nIn the bottom of this boat, which was evidently the clinker-built\r\nskiff of a merchant vessel, and was all painted yellow, as a\r\npreservation from the sun in a warm climate, there lay under the\r\nthwarts a man, either asleep, in a stupor, or dead,--at first we knew\r\nnot which; but he was pale enough to have passed for the last.\r\n\r\nBy his tawny visage and coal-black beard, his long scarlet cap and\r\nsash, in which a sheathed knife was stuck, and also by the rings in\r\nhis ears, we recognized him to be a Spanish seaman.  He was a man\r\nnaturally of a tall and powerful frame, but of forbidding aspect,--of\r\ngreat personal strength, but wasted apparently by toil, by exposure\r\nand famine.\r\n\r\nA dark and coagulated crust of something like blood appeared on his\r\nbaked lips and thick moustaches, on the blackness of which, the\r\nsaline particles of the sea foam, dried by the tropical sun,\r\nglittered white as hoar frost on a bush in winter.\r\n\r\nAs we roused him, he grasped his knife instinctively and repulsively,\r\nbut relinquished it, and then stared wildly at us, muttering in\r\nimploring tones,\r\n\r\n\"Aqua, aqua, por amor de Dios!\"--(water, for the love of God).\r\n\"Misericordia!  O senores,--O Ave Maria, misericordia!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here, Jack Spaniard, ship a drop o' this; it is the real Jamaiky,\"\r\nsaid Tattooed Tom, pouring between the parched lips of the Spaniard\r\nsome rum from a bottle, which most likely had been put in the boat by\r\nthe foresight of Hislop.\r\n\r\nThe black eyes of the castaway dilated and flashed as the spirit\r\nrevived him, restoring his wasted energies, and bringing a hectic\r\ncolor to his cheek.\r\n\r\n\"Belay now,\" said Tom; \"you must get some Thames water from the brig\r\nbefore you take more of this.\"\r\n\r\n\"Muchos gracias--many, many thanks,\" said the Spaniard, in tones of\r\nthankfulness.\r\n\r\n\"Enough o' that;--stow your slack, and come on board if you can,\"\r\nsaid Tom, testily, as he had sulky recollections of our adventures at\r\nthe Grand Canary.\r\n\r\nRestored by the mouthful of alcohol, the Spaniard staggered up, but\r\nwith difficulty; and then we perceived that gouts of blood, dried and\r\nencrusted by the sun, were on his person, and on the inside of the\r\nboat, especially on one of the thwarts.\r\n\r\n\"What is this--blood?\" asked Hislop, with an imperceptible shudder.\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard started, and became, if possible, paler at the question,\r\nas he nervously clutched the gunwale of his boat with both hands, and\r\nsaid, in broken accents,--\r\n\r\n\"My dog, senores; I killed a dog that was with me, because--because\r\nit went mad in the hot sunshine, and being without water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why did you not throw it into the sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have bitten me, senor, and might perhaps have come into the\r\nboat again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Likely enough,\" muttered one of our men.\r\n\r\n\"You could have knocked it over with an oar,\" said Hislop; \"but did\r\nyour dog wear _this_!\" he added, fishing up with the boat-hook a cap\r\nthat lay in the bilge water under the stern sheets of the skiff.\r\n\r\n\"That cap is mine,\" said the Spaniard, in a husky voice, while\r\nclosing his eyes, as if wearied or appalled.\r\n\r\n\"Have you two heads?\" asked Hislop, sternly\r\n\r\n\"No, senor; but--but--\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"A man may have _two_ caps for all that.\"\r\n\r\nPerceiving that he was on the point of sinking again, Tom Lambourne\r\npoured some more of the rum into his mouth, and we dragged him into\r\nour boat, setting the skiff, which was quite useless to us, adrift\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\n\"What was your ship?\" asked Hislop, who spoke Spanish fluently.\r\n\r\n\"The _Marshal Serrano_--a Spanish brig from Cadiz.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the Canaries last?\" I inquired hastily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; bound to Costa Rica.\"\r\n\r\nTom Lambourne gave me a rapid glance, as he spat on his hands and\r\npushed his oar through the rowlock.\r\n\r\n\"She foundered and went down with all hands on board,\" continued the\r\nfamished Spaniard, in a broken voice and with quivering hips.\r\n\r\n\"_All?_\" reiterated Hislop, sternly and dubiously.\r\n\r\n\"All, save myself, senor,\" replied the other, hesitatingly, and\r\nlowering his hollow eyes; \"I escaped in the skiff.\"\r\n\r\n\"With your dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"Si, Senor.\"\r\n\r\n\"In what latitude did this take place?\"\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation, the Spaniard gave us the latitude and\r\nlongitude.\r\n\r\n\"I can't make out this fellow's story in any way,\" said Hislop, in\r\nEnglish.  \"By the theory and law of storms, we should have had a\r\ntouch of the same gale which foundered his brig--if such a gale\r\nexisted.  He has deserted, or been marooned.  I don't believe a word\r\nhe says.  What is your name?\" he asked in Spanish.\r\n\r\n\"Antonio.\"\r\n\r\nI started on hearing it, for my suspicions were becoming more and\r\nmore confirmed.\r\n\r\n\"Antonio.  What more?\"\r\n\r\n\"El Cubano, or the Cuban; for so my shipmates termed me, and I have\r\nno other name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Quick, my lads,\" said Hislop; \"lay out on your oars.\"\r\n\r\nWe were soon alongside the _Eugenie_, and had our castaway hoisted on\r\nboard, when, for a time, an end was put to our queries, but not to\r\nour surmises, by his becoming insensible.  We had questioned him\r\nalready perhaps too much, considering the weakness of his condition.\r\n\r\nHe adhered to his original story in every particular when examined by\r\nWeston and Hislop a day or two after; that he belonged to the Spanish\r\nmerchant brig, _Marshal Serrano_, the same craft which had worked\r\nwith us out of the road stead of Santa Cruz; that she had foundered\r\nin a storm, being overmasted and overladen, and that he alone had\r\nescaped of all the crew; that when his dog became mad, he had slain\r\nthe animal and cast the carcase into the sea; and that he had been a\r\nweek floating about in an open boat, without food and without aught\r\nto cool his parched tongue, save the heavy tropical dew of heaven,\r\nwhen we found him; and to the truth of all this, he was ready to\r\nswear over two crossed knives, in the fashion of his country.\r\n\r\nIn short, we were obliged to content ourselves with his narrative,\r\nwhich Hislop duly engrossed in the ship's log, while expressing great\r\ndisbelief as to its authenticity.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, our mate denied that any such storm as that in\r\nwhich the Cuban alleged his brig perished had ever existed; and he\r\ndeduced from his favorite theory that we were, and had been, in the\r\ndirect _track_ of such a storm, and must have felt its influence long\r\nere this.\r\n\r\nHence he thought it more probable that the man had deserted in the\r\nnight, perhaps in consequence of committing some crime, or for the\r\nsame reason had been marooned and set adrift.\r\n\r\nThe crew were divided in opinion, and Tom Lambourne openly expressed\r\nhis disbelief that the blood which covered the clothes of the Cuban\r\nand the thwart of the boat ever came from the veins of a dog; and\r\nothers asserted that he must have quarrelled with an unfortunate\r\nshipmate, and killed him; or had perhaps assassinated him in sleep\r\nfor the horrible purpose of prolonging his own existence.\r\n\r\nAmid these unpleasant surmises as to his character and position, in a\r\nfew days the Spaniard joined the crew in working the ship, and proves\r\nhimself to be a steady, industrious, and able seaman; and as three of\r\nour hands were on the sick list, his services were the more valuable.\r\n\r\nOn remarking this to Tom Lambourne,\r\n\r\n\"It is all very true, sir,\" he replied; \"but I don't like a seaman\r\nwho cannot look his shipmate right in the face.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a physiognomist,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Don't know what kind of a _mist_ that may be, Master Rodney; but\r\nthis I know--there is always something cunning and dangerous in a\r\nfellow who looks over your shoulder, as that Spaniard does, when he\r\nshould look at your eyes.\"\r\n\r\nAntonio had an excessive dislike for deck duty by night.  He\r\nexhibited a strange dread of being left alone, and could scarcely be\r\nprevailed upon to look over the vessel's side, always shrinking back,\r\nas if he expected to see something hideous rise out of the sea.\r\nWeston suggested that perhaps his recent suffering had unmanned and\r\nrendered him nervous; but the crew thought otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn his sleep, Antonio frequently disturbed the men in the forecastle\r\nbunks by his mutterings, his wild dreams, outcries, and sonorous\r\nSpanish maledictions.\r\n\r\nI was at the wheel on a calm and lovely night (it was the 13th of\r\nJanuary), when we were off the beautiful shore of Hispaniola.  I\r\nremember well that Cape Samanna bore west by south, and Cape Cabron\r\nwest by north; for my task of steering was new to me, and Weston's\r\norders were \"to keep her full and by,\"--that is, as close to the wind\r\nas possible without making the canvas shiver.\r\n\r\nI could see the lights that glittered in the distant villages that\r\nstudded the low but fertile peninsula of Samanna.  All was still and\r\nquiet in the ship and around it.  Soothed by the solemnity of the\r\nhour and the vast solitude of the sea, my heart was full, and busy\r\nmemory brought before me loved faces and voices, places and scenes,\r\nthat were far, far away in dear Old England.\r\n\r\nThe brig was gliding through the water rapidly but imperceptibly, and\r\nalmost without a sound; the men of the watch were leaning over the\r\nbulwark to leeward; and the air, the sea, and all aloft and below,\r\nseemed to sleep in the moonlight; not a reef point pattered on the\r\ntaut canvas, and scarcely a wavelet rippled, save in the dead-water\r\nastern that marked the white wake of the _Eugenie_.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a shrill and piercing cry rang out upon the night, and\r\nAntonio the Cubano rushed from the forecastle with the wildest terror\r\nexpressed in his black eyes; his visage was pale and ghastly, and the\r\nperspiration glittered like bead drops on his clammy brow.  With his\r\nbare feet, he stumbled over the chain cable, which lay coiled on the\r\ndeck, for on that afternoon we had hauled it up, and bent it to the\r\nworking anchor.\r\n\r\nHe came running aft in his shirt, brandishing a knife in his hand,\r\nand exclaiming, in fierce and then imploring accents--\r\n\r\n\"Who says I did it?--who dares to say so?\"\r\n\r\nThen letting his arms drop as he slunk back to his bunk, we heard him\r\ngroan out--\r\n\r\n\"_El cuchillo--el cuchillo!_\" (the knife--the knife).\r\n\r\nHence, under such circumstances, it may easily be supposed that among\r\nthe crew there floated strange and dark surmises as to the past life\r\nof Antonio el Cubano.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE WATER-SPOUT.\r\n\r\nAs the sun increased in heat, notwithstanding the season of the year,\r\nI was soon sensible of the comfort of white clothing, when contrasted\r\nwith dark woollen or broadcloth, as the latter absorbs, and the\r\nformer repels the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nMarc Hislop illustrated this to me by igniting paper with a\r\nburning-glass; whenever the focus was brought to bear upon dark\r\nplaces, such as the printed letters, they were instantly consumed.\r\n\r\nWe ran along the coast of Hispaniola, and saw the wavy ridges of its\r\nmountains that tower into the clouds; we sighted Tortuga, a rocky\r\nisland covered with palm-trees and sandal-wood, but surrounded by\r\nreefs and shoals; and rounding Cape St. Nicholas, stood to the\r\nsouthward between the great islands of Jamaica and Cuba, but without\r\nseeing either of them at that time.\r\n\r\nFor three days we had dark and cloudy weather.\r\n\r\nAbout three P.M. on the 24th of January, a small speck, which\r\nappeared to the westward on our weather beam, grew rapidly into a\r\ngloomy cloud, and swiftly, as if on the wings of a destroying angel,\r\nit traversed the thickening air and the agitated sea, which darkened\r\nbeneath its shadow; and so this speck came on, until it grew an awful\r\nthunder-cloud.\r\n\r\n\"Bear a hand fore and aft!  Hurrah, my lads!--make all snug before\r\nthe tempest breaks!\" were the cheering orders of Weston, Hislop, and\r\nLambourne, as the brig was prepared to encounter a heavy squall.\r\n\r\nThe rain soon fell in torrents, impeding the men at their work of\r\nclose reefing, furling, and stowing some of the heavier canvas, and\r\nin tightly belaying the running rigging; for when loose ropes are\r\nflying about in a tempest, and cracking in men's faces like\r\ncoach-whips, they become sufficiently bewildering to impede the\r\nworking of the ship.\r\n\r\nUnder the lower edge of the approaching cloud, when about twelve\r\nmiles distant, we beheld an object which filled us with wonder and\r\nawe.\r\n\r\nIt was a tremendous spout, or column of water, connected with the\r\ncloud above, and the sea below (the sea, from which a circular wind\r\nhad sucked it upward), that was now visible.\r\n\r\nThis column was like a solid mass of white breakers, approaching with\r\nincredible speed over waves that began to rise in short and pyramidal\r\npeaks.\r\n\r\nHislop was too busy clewing up canvas, sending yards down from aloft,\r\nbelaying and ordering, and so lost a famous opportunity for\r\nexpatiating--as no doubt he would have done--on the _theory_ of these\r\nspouts; for this phenomenon filled us with the greatest alarm, lest\r\nit might swoop down upon the _Eugenie_, dismast and destroy her like\r\na child's toy-ship.\r\n\r\nAntonio el Cubano, being the most powerful and muscular man on board,\r\nwas ordered to the wheel.\r\n\r\nAcross the sea this column seemed to pass with the cloud, boiling,\r\nfoaming, and with the sound of a mighty cascade pouring into a deep\r\nvalley, but yet maintaining a position quite perpendicular.  Around\r\nits base the waves seemed in dreadful commotion, rising and falling,\r\nseething and glittering in the lightning which shot at times from the\r\ngloomy bosom of the cloud that floated over them.\r\n\r\nAs this terrible phenomenon approached from the westward, Captain\r\nWeston conceived that we might escape its influence by altering the\r\nbrig's course, and so passing it.  I have heard of water-spouts being\r\ndissipated by the effect of heavily-shotted guns; but we had no such\r\nappliances--at least we had no shot on board.\r\n\r\nThe breeze which was blowing fresh, and had not as yet become a gale\r\n(to us at least), veered north-westerly; so we shook the reefs out of\r\nour topsails and trimmed sharp by the wind.\r\n\r\n\"Luff, luff--keep your luff--keep her to,\" were the incessant orders\r\nof Weston; and the _Eugenie_ flew through the water like a\r\nrace-horse; held by the powerful hands of Antonio, she never yawed an\r\ninch; and by especial Providence she got _to windward_ of that\r\ndreadful phenomenon, which passed us, cloud and all, about six miles\r\nastern, when as it changed color, from grayish green to white, it\r\npresented a scene so sublime and terrible, that \"the boldest held his\r\nbreath for a time;\" and Antonio, who was blanched white with terror,\r\nthough he had frequently seen such spouts in these, his native seas,\r\nassured me, with chattering teeth, that he had never beheld one of\r\nsuch magnitude; and it was long before he could be certain of our\r\nsafety, and ceased to mutter,--\r\n\r\n\"O mala ventura--mala ventura!\" (literally, bad luck.)\r\n\r\nFrom white, the water-spout became dusky purple, when a gleam of the\r\nsetting sun fell on it, and the waves at its base glittered in all\r\nthe colors of the rainbow.\r\n\r\n\"Thank heaven! that is past,\" said Weston.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, sir,\" said old Roberts, the man-o'-war's man, \"it is enough to\r\nmake one's hair stand on end for a week.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had we been twenty minutes' sail _astern_, we could not have escaped\r\nit!\" said Hislop; \"but we have handled the brig beautifully.  That\r\nugly Spaniard at the wheel was worth his weight in gold just now!\"\r\n\r\nFor nearly an hour the sea was greatly agitated; but as the\r\n_Eugenie_, still braced sharp to the wind, flew from one long roller\r\nto another, we rapidly got into smooth water.  The barometer rose\r\nquickly; the vapors dispersed; and when the setting sun gave us a\r\nparting smile from the far horizon, the storm-cloud and its\r\nwater-spout had disappeared together, or melted away in the distant\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe little eddies of wind, which on a fine summer morning may be seen\r\nwhirling up the dust and dry leaves in circles on a road, are exactly\r\non the same principle as those mighty phenomena which become\r\ntornadoes, cyclones, and water-spouts, when they reach the ocean,\r\nwhere they may easily dismast and perhaps sink the largest\r\nline-of-battle ship.\r\n\r\nThose spouts rise from the sea exactly like the moving pillars of\r\nsand, which the whirlwinds sweep from the hot and arid deserts of\r\nAfrica and Arabia.\r\n\r\nAbout six bells (_i.e._, seven P.M.), this escape was followed by a\r\ndead calm, which lasted till midnight, and during that time we talked\r\nof nothing but the skill with which we had got the weathergage of\r\nthat column of foam.  As the sun set, with a rapidity peculiar to\r\nthese latitudes, the brilliant tints he shed on sea and sky changed\r\nwith equal speed from gold to saffron, from these to vivid purple,\r\nand from thence to the hue of sapphire.\r\n\r\nThe sensation of loneliness which the departure of the sun excites in\r\nthe breast of a landsman at sea is peculiar; but this was soon chased\r\nfrom mine by the splendor of the rising moon, which changed the\r\nsapphire tints of sea and sky to liquid silver and the clearest blue.\r\n\r\nAbove, no cloud, nor even the tiniest shred of vapor was visible.\r\nSea blended with sky at the horizon, and seemed to melt into each\r\nother, so that no line was traceable.  Save a planet or two,\r\ntwinkling with less light than usual, there seemed to be no stars in\r\nheaven, for the glory of the full-orbed moon eclipsed them all; her\r\nlight fell brightly on the white sails of the _Eugenie_, and in it\r\nthe features of our faces were distinct as at noon-day, and now it\r\nwas the noon of night.\r\n\r\nAbout twelve o'clock a fresh breeze sprung up, and the ship's course\r\nwas resumed.\r\n\r\n\"By keeping the weathergage, and beyond the circle of the spout's\r\nattraction, we escaped without shipping a drop of water!\" said\r\nWeston, for the twentieth time.  \"Let me see how you enter all this\r\nin the log, Hislop.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is no uncommon thing for a craft at sea to be deluged by a spout\r\nof _fresh_ water, which the whirlwind has torn up from an inland\r\nlake,\" said Hislop; \"and houses, far in-shore, have in the same\r\nfashion been deluged by salt water absorbed from the sea;--and hence\r\nthe showers of dried herrings, of which we have heard so much at\r\ntimes.  Now, Rodney, you will perhaps be surprised when I tell you,\r\nthat it is the winds which produce a calm like that we have had\r\ntonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"The winds!\" I reiterated, surprised at such a paradox from our\r\ntheorist.\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  The opposition of winds will at times produce a perfect calm,\r\nand then when rain falls it is always gentle and equable; but when\r\nclouds seem to move _against_ the lower winds, or when streams of air\r\ndenote a variety of the aerial current, and consequently the approach\r\nof rain----\"\r\n\r\n\"What strange sound is that ahead, or at least, forward?\" said\r\nWeston, interrupting Hislop, who would perhaps have theorized for an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n\"It is Antonio, groaning in his sleep in the forecastle,\" said Ned\r\nCarleton, who was at the wheel.\r\n\r\n\"I wish the ship were rid of him and his dreams,\" added Hislop,\r\ntestily.  \"Well, as I was saying, when the adverse movements of the\r\nclouds seem to denote----\"\r\n\r\n\"Light a-head!\" cried a voice from the bow.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, Roberts?\" asked Weston, while Hislop stamped with\r\nvexation at the second interruption.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"How does it bear?\"\r\n\r\n\"East-north-east.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then it is Cape St. Antonio Light, the most western point of Cuba,\"\r\nsaid Weston, with confidence and pleasure in his tone.  \"I thought I\r\ncould smell the land with the first cat's paw, before the breeze\r\nfreshened.\"\r\n\r\nThe light, dim and distant like a star, was now seen to twinkle among\r\nthe waves at the horizon.\r\n\r\nFor more than an hour I remained on deck with my eyes fixed upon that\r\nfeeble but increasing beacon, which indicated a foreign shore; then I\r\nwent below and turned in, with a sigh of pleasure that the voyage was\r\nnearly over, and a hope that when I traversed those waves again, I\r\nshould be on my return home--home to my father and mother, to Sybil\r\nand Dot,--to the old Rectory, with its shady oak-grove, its green\r\nlawn, and the masses of ivy, woodbine, and honeysuckle that shaded\r\nits time-worn walls.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCUBA.\r\n\r\nWhen day dawned we had rounded Caybo San Antonio, and were running\r\nalong the northern shore of Cuba.\r\n\r\nI was up early, by eight bells--or a little after four A.M.--for I\r\nhad the morning watch; and with deep interest I surveyed the coast of\r\nthat beautiful island, which lay about ten miles distant,--the first\r\nand now the _last_ portion of that vast empire beyond the seas which\r\nColumbus bequeathed to Castile and Leon.\r\n\r\n\"Dat is mi country, senor,\" said Antonio, who was at the wheel; and\r\nthis remark, with the repulsive aspect of the Spaniard and his\r\nmysterious character, served to dissipate my momentary enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n\"That is Caybo Bueno Vista,--and the breakers on the weather-bow,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"mark the Collorados, a long reef of rocks.  The blue\r\nsharks are as thick there as the stars in the sky.\"\r\n\r\nWe were now in the Gulf of Florida.\r\n\r\nThe sky was cloudless and blue; and now it seemed as if the welkin\r\nabove and the almost waveless sea below were endeavoring to outvie\r\neach other in calmness, in beauty, and in the glory of their azure\r\ndepths.  The wind was off the land and rather a-head; but the sails\r\nwere trimmed to perfection, and we ran through the Gulf on a taut\r\nbowline.\r\n\r\nI have so much more to narrate than my limited space permits me to\r\ngive in full detail, that I must compress into one chapter all that\r\nrelates to my visit to Matanzas.\r\n\r\nOur run through the Gulf was delightful; and on the 29th of January,\r\njust as a rosy tint was stealing over all the sea and the rocky shore\r\nof Cuba, after the sun had set beyond the waters of the Gulf of\r\nMexico, we saw Havana light, bearing south by west, and distant about\r\nfourteen miles.  So we passed in the night the wealthy capital of\r\nCuba, so famed in the annals of our victories--_La Habana_, or the\r\nharbor--of which, from our being so far to seaward, we could see\r\nnothing but the great revolving light, which burns so brightly on the\r\nhigh rock of the Morro, or Castello de los Santos Reyes; and before\r\ndawn we descried the light of Santa Cruz on our weather-bow.\r\n\r\nWeston drew my attention to it, adding \"that is the beacon which so\r\nscared me when it shone through the stern windows of the empty\r\npolacca brig.\"\r\n\r\nNext day, the 29th, after encountering a head wind, against which we\r\ntacked frequently between the Pan de Matanzas and the wooded point of\r\nSumberella, at ten in the morning, a Spanish mulatto pilot came on\r\nboard and took the brig in charge.\r\n\r\nWe ran safely into the harbor, and by eleven o'clock came to anchor\r\nat a place recommended by Antonio, half a cable's length from the\r\ncastle of St. Severino.  In half an hour after, the sails were all\r\nunbent and stowed below, and preparations were made for \"breaking\r\nbulk,\"--to unload the vessel, whose cargo, I have stated, consisted\r\nof steam machinery and coals for the sugar and coffee mills.\r\n\r\nGangs of Spanish mulattoes, negro porters, and lumpers, in red shirts\r\nand white drawers, with broad straw hats, and nearly all with rings\r\nin their ears, came on board in quest of employment; and then all was\r\nconfusion, garlic, dirt, jabbering in Spanish and Congo, singing,\r\nswearing, and smoking cigaritos.\r\n\r\nI was now at liberty to go ashore, and after the first bustle was\r\nover, Weston left Hislop in charge of the brig and accompanied me.\r\nMatanzas presented nothing new to him, but I surveyed with interest,\r\nnot unmixed with wonder, the New World in which I found myself.\r\n\r\nThe city of Don Carlos de Matanzas occupies a gentle eminence between\r\nthe rivers San Juan and Yumuri, which roll into the bay from the\r\nmountainous ridge that traverses all Cuba.  Its name, Matanzas,\r\nsignifies the place of murder, because in that bay some of the\r\nSpaniards of Columbus were slain by the native Indians.\r\n\r\nMost of the houses are built of good stone, but have all their\r\nwindows iron-barred without and barricaded within, for the population\r\n(of which our shipmate Antonio was a striking specimen) consists of\r\nabout thirty thousand olive-skinned Spaniards, and double that number\r\nof slaves and free mulattoes, all loose, reckless, fiery, and apt to\r\nuse their knives on trivial occasions.\r\n\r\nThere was not a ship lying there for England, or any other craft by\r\nwhich Weston could have sent me home.  A Spanish steam-packet was on\r\nthe eve of departing for Cadiz; but being wearied by the monotony of\r\nmy long voyage, I was scarcely in a mood for the sea again, and\r\nwished to spend a little time on shore instead of leaving with her.\r\n\r\nHowever, I wrote to my family by the Spanish mail, acquainting them\r\nof my safety--with the strange accident which had so suddenly torn me\r\nfrom them, and adding that I would return by the first ship bound for\r\nany part of England; if possible, with the _Eugenie_, which would\r\nprobably be freighted for London.\r\n\r\nAfter the packet sailed with my letter in her capacious bags, I\r\nexperienced an emotion of greater happiness and contentment than I\r\nhad ever done since leaving home; for the sorrow which I knew all\r\nthere must have suffered, and would still be suffering, hung heavily\r\non my heart.\r\n\r\nAs we were returning to the brig, which had now been warped alongside\r\nthe mole, when passing through the street which contains the great\r\nhospital, we heard the sound of trumpets, and saw the glittering of\r\nlances with long streamers above the heads of a dense crowd of people\r\nof all shades of color, black, yellow, and brown; and we had to doff\r\nour hats with due respect as they passed, for in the midst,\r\nsurrounded by a staff of officers, epauletted and aiguletted, their\r\nbreasts sparkling with medals and crosses, and each of them riding\r\nwith a cocked hat under his right arm, came the present\r\nCaptain-General of Cuba, a marshal of the Spanish army, Don Francisco\r\nSerrano de Dominguez, attended by an escort of mulatto lancers, all\r\nmounted on Spanish horses.\r\n\r\nHe was a fine-looking man, and though aged, had all the bearing of\r\nwhat he was, or I should say _is_--a grandee of Old Castile.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the _Eugenie_ we found Antonio, the Cuban, working\r\namong the crew as lustily and actively as any man on board.  Weston\r\nnow offered him remuneration for the time he had been with us, with a\r\nhint that he might find a berth elsewhere; but our castaway evinced\r\nthe greatest reluctance to leave the brig, and begged that he might\r\nbe permitted to remain on board, as three of our best hands had been\r\nsent ashore sick to the hospital.\r\n\r\nSo short-sighted is man, that Captain Weston, despite the dislike of\r\nthe crew, and the advice of Marc Hislop, ordered that the name of\r\nAntonio be entered on the ship's books as a foremast-man.\r\n\r\nThree weeks after our arrival, the brig was careened to starboard,\r\nwhen clear of all the cargo, and had her copper scraped and cleaned,\r\nan operation which the constant rains of the season greatly retarded.\r\n\r\nThere was much in Cuba to feed an imaginative mind, and mine was full\r\nof the voyages, the daring adventures, and the vast discoveries of\r\nColumbus, with the exploits of the buccaneers, whose haunts were amid\r\nthese wild, and, in those days, savage shores.\r\n\r\nI thought of the gaily plumed and barbarously armed caciques whom\r\nColumbus had met in their fleet _piroguas_, or had encountered in the\r\ndense forests which clothe the Cuban mountains--forests, old,\r\nperhaps, as the days of the deluge--of the yellow-skinned women with\r\ntheir long, flowing black hair, and with plates of polished gold\r\nhanging at their ears and noses, of the fierce warriors streaked with\r\nsable war-paint, and armed with cane arrows shod with teeth or\r\npoisoned fish-bones, that fell harmless from the Spanish coats of\r\nmail; of the wild Caribs who devoured their prisoners--with whom a\r\nbattle was but a precursor of a feast; and of the famous fighting\r\nwomen--the terrible Amazons of Guadaloupe.\r\n\r\nI thought of the story of Columbus writing the narrative of his\r\nwonderful discoveries, his perils and adventures, on a roll of\r\nparchment, which he wrapped in oil-cloth covered over with wax,\r\ninclosed in a little cask, and then cast into the sea, with a prayer,\r\nand the hope that if _he_ and his crew perished, this record of their\r\nachievements might be cast by the ocean on the shore of some\r\nChristian land.\r\n\r\nAs I sat by the sounding sea that rolled into the bay of Matanzas,\r\nwhat would I not have given to have seen the waves cast that old\r\ncask, covered with weeds and barnacles, at my feet!\r\n\r\nBut now the plodding steam-tug and the rusty merchant trader ploughed\r\nthe waters of the bay, instead of the gilded Spanish caravels, or the\r\nlong war-piroguas of the Indian warriors; and where they fought their\r\nbloodiest battles on the wooded shore, or in the green savanna, where\r\nthe painted cacique and the mailed Castilian met hand to hand in\r\nmortal strife, the smoke of the steam-mill, grinding coffee, or\r\nboiling sugar, darkened the sky, and the songs of the negroes were\r\nheard as they hoed in the plantations, or in gangs of forty trucked\r\nmahogany logs, each drawn by eight sturdy oxen, to the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in a creek of the bay--the same place where the Dutch Admiral\r\nHeyn sunk the Spanish plate fleet--I was wont to sit dreamily for\r\nhours, with the murmur of the waves in my ears, with the buzz of\r\ninsects, and the voice of the mocking-birds among the palmettoes,\r\nwhile watching the sails that glided past the headlands of the bay,\r\non their way to the Bahama Channel, or the great Gulf of Florida.\r\n\r\nThis was my favorite resort.  A wood of cocoa-nut and other trees\r\nshaded the place, and made it so dark that I have seen the fire-flies\r\nglance about at noon.  The cocoas are about the height of Dutch\r\npoplars, and are covered with oblong leaves, which, when young, are\r\nof a pale red.  As spring drew on, the branches became covered with\r\nscarlet and yellow flowers.\r\n\r\nOver these, the vast coral-tree spread its protecting foliage, whence\r\nthe Spaniards, in their beautiful language, name it La Madre del\r\nCocoa, the smallest of which has at times a thousand lovely scarlet\r\nblossoms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nAN EVIL SPIRIT.\r\n\r\nWe sailed from the bay of Matanzas at two A.M., on the 3d of April,\r\nbound for the Cape of Good Hope, which we were fated never to reach.\r\n\r\nThe _Eugenie_ had been freighted for that colony with a rich cargo of\r\nmolasses, sugar, coffee, and tobacco; and arrangements had been made\r\nthat from Cape Town she would be chartered for London; thus I had a\r\nfair prospect of seeing nearly a half of this terrestrial globe\r\nbefore I repassed my good old father's threshold at Erlesmere.\r\n\r\nI earnestly hoped that we might encounter no more water-spouts or\r\ntornadoes, as they were not at all to my taste; but from other causes\r\nthan phenomena or the war of the elements, it was my fortune, or\r\nrather misfortune, to undergo such peril and suffering as were far\r\nbeyond my conception or anticipation.\r\n\r\nBy eight o'clock on the morning of our departure, the light on\r\nPiedras Key was bearing south by east, sinking into the waves astern,\r\nand going out as we bade a long farewell to the lovely shores of Cuba.\r\n\r\nThree of our men had died of yellow fever in hospital, so we sailed\r\nfrom Matanzas with ten able-bodied hands, exclusive of three\r\nship-boys, the captain, first and second mates.\r\n\r\nIn these waters, after the rainy season, the sky is so cloudless in\r\nthe forenoon that the heat of the sun becomes almost insupportable;\r\nthus we were soon glad to resort to the use of windsails rigged down\r\nthe open skylight to an awning over the quarter-deck for coolness,\r\nand to skids for the prevention of blisters on the sides of the brig;\r\nbut in the starry night the land-wind which comes off these fertile\r\nisles, laden with the rich aroma of their spice-growing savannas, is\r\nbeyond description grateful and delicious.\r\n\r\nWithout any incident worth recording we ran through the sea of the\r\nWindward Isles, thence along the coast of South America; and when we\r\napproached the calm latitudes, as that tract of ocean near the\r\nEquator is named, we became sensible of the overpowering increase of\r\nheat, while the breezes were but \"fanning ones,\" as the sailors term\r\nthose which, under the double influence of the air and motion of the\r\nhull, are just sufficient to make the lighter canvas collapse and\r\nswell again.\r\n\r\nWe were soon aware of other annoyances than mere heat; for now it\r\nseemed as if there was an evil spirit on board the _Eugenie_, and\r\nthat nothing went right within or about her.\r\n\r\nThe crew sulked and quarrelled among themselves as if the demon of\r\nmischief lurked in the vessel, and daily something unfortunate\r\noccurred.  Halyards or braces gave way, by which the yards were\r\nthrown aback; and in one instance the brig nearly lost her mainmast.\r\nStanding and running rigging were found to be mysteriously fretted,\r\nand even cut, as if by a knife; and then the crew whispered together\r\nof Antonio el Cubano,--that horrid, dark, and mysterious fellow,\r\nwhose character none of us could fathom.\r\n\r\nTwice our compasses went wrong, and remained so for days; and before\r\nthe cause was discovered, the _Eugenie_ had drifted far from her\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThis varying was inexplicable, until Hislop, who set himself to\r\nwatch, and frequently saw Antonio hovering near the binnacle at\r\nnight, unshipped the compass-box, and found there were concealed near\r\nit an iron marlinspike on one side, and a lump of tallow on the\r\nother, either of which was sufficient to affect the magnetic needle.\r\n\r\nAfter their removal the compass worked as well as before.  The crew\r\nwere strictly questioned; all vowed total ignorance of the\r\ntransaction, and Antonio summoned every saint in the Spanish calendar\r\nto attest his innocence, but none, however, appeared.  The crew now\r\nfelt convinced that, inspired by some emotion of malice or mischief,\r\nhe alone was the culprit; and if not loud, their wrath was deep\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nThese variations of our compass set the busy brain of Marc Hislop to\r\nwork; and in a day or two he declared that he had discovered a plan\r\nfor preventing the repetition of tricks so dangerous, by _insulating_\r\nthe needle, so as to protect the compass from attractions false or\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nI am uncertain whether he perfected this experiment, but Antonio soon\r\nwent to work another way; for one day, when he was supposed to be\r\nbusy in the maintop, he shouted, \"Stand from under!\" and ere Hislop,\r\nwho was just beneath, could give the usual response, \"Let go,\" a\r\nheavy marlinspike, the same which had been found in the binnacle,\r\nslipped from the hand of Antonio, and fell through the topgrating.\r\n\r\nThe iron bar crashed into the deck at the feet of Hislop; whether\r\nthis occurred by inadvertence or design we knew not, but the Scotsman\r\nthought the latter.\r\n\r\n\"That rascally Spanish picaroon will work us some serious mischief\r\nbefore we overhaul our ground-tackle or see the Cape,\" said Weston,\r\nwho was enraged by this new incident, and the narrow escape of\r\nHislop, for whom he had a great regard.\r\n\r\n\"Aye, he has a hang-dog look about him that I never liked,\" replied\r\nthe latter.  \"He seems to be always down by the head, somehow.  We\r\nshould have left him in his skiff, just as we found him, like a bear\r\nadrift on a grating, or a pig in a washing-tub.\"\r\n\r\nOn another occasion he injured Will White, one of the crew, by\r\nletting the topmaul fall from the foretop, where it usually lay, for\r\ndriving home the fid of the mast.\r\n\r\nHis dreams again became a source of annoyance to all in the\r\nforecastle bunks; and on being closely and severely questioned by\r\nCaptain Weston and the men, as to whether he had ever killed any one,\r\nby accident or otherwise, after being long badgered, he half drew his\r\nugly knife from its shark-skin sheath, and replied, sullenly,--\r\n\r\n\"Only a Chinaman or so, when in California.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wish you would clap a stopper on your mouth when you go to\r\nsleep, or turn in out of ear-shot in a topgallant studding sail,--as\r\nfar off as you choose, and the further off the better,\" said old\r\nRoberts, sulkily, after the ravings of the Cubano had kept him awake\r\nfor several nights.\r\n\r\n\"You seem to dream a great deal, Antonio,\" said Weston, with a keen\r\nglance, beneath which the Spaniard quailed.\r\n\r\n\"Si, Senor Capitano,\" he stammered.\r\n\r\n\"How is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am very fond of dreams,\" he replied, with a bitter smile on his\r\nlip and a scowl in his dark eye.\r\n\r\n\"Have you pleasant ones?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say that they are always so, but I should like to procure\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall I tell you how to do so, shipmate?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you please, Senor,\" growled the Spaniard.\r\n\r\n\"Go to sleep, if you can, with that which is better than the formula\r\nof prayers, which at times you pay out like the line running off a\r\nlog-reel.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is it you mean, mio Capitano?\"\r\n\r\n\"_A good conscience_,\" replied Weston, with a peculiar emphasis.\r\n\r\nA black scowl came over the Spaniard's swarthy visage, as he touched\r\nthe rim of his hat, darted a furious glance at his chief accuser, the\r\nwhite-haired seaman Roberts, and to end the examination, walked\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nSoon after this, when evening came on we heard a noise in the\r\nforecastle, and the voice of Hislop, exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"Stand clear--sheer off, Antonio!  If you come athwart me, I'll knock\r\nyou down with a handspike!  What! you grip your knife, do you?  Well,\r\njust do it again, and I'll chuck you overboard like a bit of old\r\njunk.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter now?\" said I, hastening forward.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this rascally Spanish Creole has been swearing at the men again,\r\nand threatening old Roberts.\"\r\n\r\n\"He vows, sir, he will burn the ship,\" said Roberts, who seemed\r\nconsiderably excited.\r\n\r\n\"Burn the ship,\" reiterated Weston.  \"I have a great mind to put him\r\nin the bilboes for the remainder of the voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Twere best for all concerned, sir,\" said Tom Lambourne, touching\r\nhis forelock with his right hand, and giving the deck a scrape with\r\nhis left foot; \"or set him adrift with some provisions in the\r\njolly-boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, come, Antonio,\" said Weston, with greater severity than I had\r\nhitherto seen expressed in his open and honest countenance, \"you must\r\nhaul your wind--for some time you have been going too far.  I can't\r\nspare my jolly-boat, and, thank heaven! the days of marooning are\r\npast among British sailors, but beware you, shipmate, or the bilboes\r\nit shall be, and we have a pretty heavy pair below.  And as for you,\r\nMarc Hislop,\" he added, in a low voice, when we walked aft, \"take\r\ncare of yourself, for these Spanish Creoles are as slippery and\r\ntreacherous as serpents.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll keep my weather eye open,\" said Hislop.\r\n\r\n\"You will require to do so, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do?\" exclaimed the Scotsman, with growing anger.  \"If he\r\nproceeds thus, I'll break either his heart or his neck.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning, Roberts the old man-o'-war's man, who had always been\r\nAntonio's chief accuser concerning his dreams, was nowhere to be\r\nfound on board!\r\n\r\nAll the hands were turned up; the whole brig was searched, the\r\nforecastle berths, the cable-tier, and every place below from the\r\nfore to the after peak, but there was no trace of Roberts, save his\r\nold tarpaulin-hat, lying crushed and torn in the lee scuppers.\r\n\r\nHe was last seen when turned up to take the middle watch, which\r\nextends from twelve to four o'clock A.M., and Antonio was then in his\r\nhammock.\r\n\r\nRoberts was entered in the log as \"having fallen overboard in the\r\nnight;\" but his loss cast a terrible gloom over all in the ship.\r\nSuspicion grew apace, and seemed to become confirmed, as open war was\r\nsoon declared between the crew and Antonio.\r\n\r\nEvery man was ready to take _his_ \"trick\" at the wheel, rather than\r\ntrust the _Eugenie_ to his steering in the night, lest he might let\r\nher broach to, and lose her spars, or do some other mischief; and no\r\nman, if he could avoid it, would lay out on the yard _beyond_ him.\r\nNo man would walk on the same side of the deck with him, or exchange\r\na word, or a light for a pipe, or use the same cup or plate; so he\r\nwas generally to be seen, leaning moodily and alone, against the\r\nwindlass-bitts, with his black eyes fixed on the horizon, as if he\r\nexpected a sail or something else to heave in sight.\r\n\r\nWe shall soon see how all this ended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nWE CROSS THE LINE.\r\n\r\nWe were now in the latitudes of burning days, of starry nights, and\r\nbright blue seas.  The winds were light, and, as usual near the line,\r\nthere was a tremendous swell upon the ocean, which rose in long and\r\nslowly-heaving hills, without foam or ripple--smooth, glassy, and\r\nwithout sound.\r\n\r\nOn a lovely night, when the ocean seemed to sleep in the moonshine,\r\nwe crossed the equator.\r\n\r\nThe _Eugenie_ was running with the lee clews eased off--_i.e._, with\r\na flowing sheet--when Father Neptune came on board, and the usual\r\nunpleasant pranks were played on those who had never passed the\r\ngirdle of the world before.\r\n\r\nGreat preparations had been in progress all day in the forecastle,\r\nand these were perfected under cloud of night.  All the crew were on\r\ndeck save Antonio, who turned in, having probably a dread of what was\r\nabout to ensue, and knowing that he was any thing but a favorite.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by the shouts of the crew, and preceded by Will White,\r\nplaying \"Rule Britannia\" on a violin, old Father Neptune was drawn on\r\na species of hurdle aft to the quarter-deck, where Weston stood ready\r\nto receive him, with his hat in one hand, and a case-bottle of brandy\r\nin the other.\r\n\r\nUnder an old swab, which had been well dried and curled to make a wig\r\nfor the son of Saturn and Vesta, I recognized the\r\ngrotesquely-tattooed visage of my friend Tom Lambourne.  A cutlass\r\nwas stuck in his girdle, and he wore a huge paunch of canvas stuffed\r\nwith oakum.\r\n\r\nIn a gown made by the sailmaker, Ned Carlton officiated as\r\nAmphitrite; and both deities were armed with harpoons, as emblems of\r\ntheir dominion over the sea.\r\n\r\nThe attendant Tritons were got up in the same fashion, and all wore\r\nfalse noses of singular size and great brilliance, with tow wigs, and\r\nlong tails.\r\n\r\nOn Neptune and his goddess receiving a dram, and questioning the\r\ncaptain about his crew, it was discovered that Antonio and I were the\r\nonly two on board who had never crossed the line before; whereupon\r\nthe Tritons whooped and danced as they laid violent hands on me.  I\r\nsubmitted to the usual shaving and so forth with a good grace, and\r\ncompounded, to avoid other annoyances, for two bottles of brandy, and\r\nascending to the main-cross-trees, without going through the lubber's\r\nhole.  But for the Cubano there was neither ransom, escape, or\r\noutlet; and the poor wretch, in consequence of his mysterious\r\nantecedents, was very roughly handled, the more so that he had\r\nthreatened to use his knife if molested.\r\n\r\nIt was soon trundled out of his hand by one body of Tritons, while\r\nanother soused him well with salt water, as he was conveyed past the\r\nlong boat, which was lashed amidships, and in which they were\r\nstationed with buckets ready filled.\r\n\r\nHeld fast on every side, he was brought before the \"goddess-born\" and\r\ninexorable monarch of the main, who ordered \"the Lord Chief Barber at\r\nonce to shave him.\"\r\n\r\nNow, as Antonio had rather a luxuriant beard and moustache, the\r\nplentiful application thereto of a compound of tar and slush, such as\r\nwe used for greasing the masts, was the reverse of agreeable; but the\r\nstern orders of Neptune, which were bellowed hoarsely through a tin\r\ntrumpet, were faithfully and elaborately obeyed, and the contents of\r\na dirty iron-pot were smeared over the cheeks, beard, and mouth of\r\nthe Cubano, by Billy, a mischievous shipboy, with an unsparing hand.\r\n\r\n\"Demonio!  Maldita!\" were heard at intervals, and greeted with\r\nlaughter; but when he attempted to storm, or swear, the brush--a\r\nreeking tuft of oil, tar, and every horrid grease--was thrust into\r\nhis mouth.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chief Barber was now commanded to remove this noisome mess\r\nwith his razor, and he scraped it off with a piece of hoop, which had\r\nbeen carefully notched for the purpose--a process which, as it\r\nuprooted sundry thick portions of Antonio's coal-black bristles,\r\ncaused him to yell and sputter out hoarse Spanish oaths alternately.\r\n\r\nHe was again deluged with salt water; and greater severities were\r\nabout to be practised upon him, as some of the Tritons cried for \"the\r\nghost of Roberts to come out of the sea;\" others, to \"smoke him, by\r\nputting his head in the hood of the cook's funnel,\" when Weston\r\nransomed him for two bottles of brandy, and he was permitted to slink\r\naway to his bunk, breathing vengeance against all his tormentors.\r\n\r\nGrog was again served round, the deck was cleared for a dance, and\r\nthe crew footed the hours away in a succession of hornpipes, while\r\nthe grim Cubano lay growling in the forecastle.  Three cheers for the\r\nCaptain, and three more for Marc Hislop, terminated the fun, and all\r\nbut the watch retired below.\r\n\r\n\"They have gone too far with that fellow, as some of us may discover\r\nbefore the voyage comes to a close,\" said Hislop, when we were having\r\na parting glass in the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied Weston; \"he is a dark dog, and though I am not very\r\nrich, I would give a hundred pounds to fathom the mystery of old\r\nRobert's disappearance.  Well, here's to our wives and sweethearts at\r\nhome.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have neither sweetheart nor wife,\" said Hislop, as he tossed off\r\nhis glass; \"but I have a poor old mother who loves me as well as\r\neither could do.\"\r\n\r\nWeston's eye wandered to the portraits of his wife and child, to whom\r\nhe was tenderly attached, and for whom all his savings, by salary,\r\ntonnage, and hat-money,* were carefully hoarded; for whom, poor\r\nfellow, he tempted the dangers of the great deep, the war of the\r\nelements, and endured the hardships of a sailor's life--his wife, his\r\nlittle one, and their home--\"his all; his sheet-anchor in this world,\r\nand his guide to the next,\" as I once heard him say, forcibly and\r\nstrangely.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Primage, or \"hat-money,\" is a small allowance paid to the master of\r\na vessel for the care he takes of the goods with which she is laden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE CUBANO UNMASKED.\r\n\r\nAs we kept the coast of South America well aboard, a few days after\r\nwe saw Cape San Roque, or, as it is sometimes named, Point Pelinga,\r\nthe north-eastern extremity of Brazil, rising from the blue water\r\nlike a purple cloud.  But it diminished to a low black streak on our\r\nweather quarter when the sun set, and we found ourselves ploughing\r\nthe waves of the Southern Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThere fell a calm for a whole day after this, and while the _Eugenie_\r\nrolled lazily on the long glassy swells, with her topsails flapping,\r\nand her courses hauled up, the sole amusement of the crew consisted\r\nin catching albatrosses, or in killing them, undeterred by the old\r\nsuperstition that it was a bird of \"good omen,\" or by the story of\r\nthe \"Ancient Mariner,\" of which they were probably ignorant.\r\n\r\nA flock of these gigantic sea-birds congregated under our stern,\r\nwhere they gobbled up every thing that was thrown over to them; so\r\nHislop and I proceeded methodically to fish them on board.\r\n\r\nWe procured strong lines, baited the hooks with pieces of pork,\r\nlashing thereto a buoy formed of a common cork, and lowered four of\r\nthese over the stern.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely touched the water, when amid a furious flapping of\r\nheavy pinions, they were eagerly swallowed; the hooks and lines began\r\nto bear tautly, and we soon had four gigantic albatrosses splashing\r\nthe water into froth in their ineffectual efforts to escape.\r\n\r\nWe towed them in, hand over hand, and after measurement found the\r\nsmallest to be eleven feet from the tip of one wing to the tip of the\r\nother.  Though rank and fishy in flavor, the flesh of these birds was\r\nmade into sea-pies, on which the crew were regaled for two days\r\nafter, and they partook of it with great apparent relish.  But Jack\r\nis not very particular, especially when at sea.\r\n\r\nThough none of the crew shared the superstition connected with the\r\ndestruction of an albatross, and probably none, save Hislop and\r\nmyself, knew the splendid ballad written by Coleridge, it would seem\r\nas if our misfortunes commenced with _that_ day's wanton sport!\r\n\r\nThe huge sea-birds became shy and left us.  The sun set amid\r\nsaffron-colored waves, and the western sky was all aflame, when the\r\nsails began to fill and collapse as the wind came in heavy puffs,\r\ncausing the masts to sway from side to side, and the bellying courses\r\nto crack and flap with a sound like thunder.\r\n\r\nAt last there came a steady breeze; the courses were let fall, and\r\nwith both sheets aft, for the wind was fair, the _Eugenie_ once more\r\nwalked through the shining water.\r\n\r\nFull, round, and silvery the moon arose, and tipped with liquid light\r\nevery wave, that seemed to dance onward with the brig, which in half\r\nan hour had the snow-white foam flying in sheets over her catheads.\r\n\r\nIt was about the hour of one in the morning that the horrible events\r\nwhich I am about to relate occurred.\r\n\r\nI was in the middle watch, relieving Weston, who, as the tropical\r\ndews were heavy, always ordered Billy the cabin boy to give me a\r\nglass of brandy-and-water before going on deck, for fear of ague, and\r\nthen he turned in.\r\n\r\nThe sullen Spaniard Antonio was at the wheel.  Tom Lambourne, Ned\r\nCarlton, and I, were walking to and fro, loitering at times, and\r\nlooking at the compass to see how she headed,--now aloft to observe\r\nhow the sails drew,--anon over the side, where the water bubbled\r\nmerrily past, or ahead at the patch of blue and star-studded sky\r\nwhich was visible under the leach of the forecourse, as the brig's\r\nbow lifted every now and then, and she rolled heavily from side to\r\nside, as all vessels do when running before the wind.\r\n\r\nAll was very still, for save the bubble of the water in the wake\r\nastern, or a gurgle as it surged up in the rudder-case, the creaking\r\nof a block, or the iron slings of the lower yards, not a sound stole\r\nupon the first hour of the silent morning.\r\n\r\nTwo of the albatrosses we had caught, were hanging by the legs from\r\nthe gallows-top abaft the foremast, where their great extended wings\r\nswung somewhat mournfully to and fro in the wind and by the motion of\r\nthe ship.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" said Tom Lambourne, suddenly looking aloft, as the topsails\r\nflapped and shivered; \"she's yawing or steering wild; what is that\r\nSpaniard about?\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is he?\" added Carlton, as we now missed Antonio from the\r\nwheel; \"Antonio, where are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone overboard, I hope,\" exclaimed the second mate, with something\r\nmore that need not be repeated, as he rushed to the wheel, and after\r\nmaking it revolve a few turns rapidly, he filled the sails and\r\nsteadied the brig.  This was done just in time, for the _Eugenie_ had\r\na press of canvas on her, and had she been taken aback, the\r\nconsequences might have been most serious.\r\n\r\n\"Look about for the skulking lubber,\" said Lambourne, in great wrath,\r\n\"and souse him well with a slush-bucket; another moment and the craft\r\nwould have broached to!\"\r\n\r\n\"He must have crept behind the longboat, and got into the\r\nforecastle,\" suggested Carlton.\r\n\r\n\"I'll bring him up with a round turn for playing this trick!\"\r\ngrumbled Lambourne.\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" said I, as a strange sound fell upon my ear.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked the others, listening.\r\n\r\n\"A cry!--did you not hear it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,--nonsense!\" said they, together.\r\n\r\n\"It was a cry that came from somewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did hear something,\" said Will White; \"but it was a sheave\r\ncreaking in a block aloft, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said I, pausing just by the capstan, as a terrible\r\nforeboding seized me; \"it came from the cabin.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no one there but the Captain, Hislop, and the boy Bill, who\r\nsleeps in the steerage, and they are all three sound enough by this\r\ntime,\" said Lambourne.\r\n\r\n\"But the sound _was_ from the cabin,\" I persisted, hastening aft.\r\n\r\nAt that moment another cry, loud and piteous,--a cry that sank into a\r\nhoarse moan, echoed through the brig, \"piercing the night's dull\r\near,\" and ringing high above the welter of the sea alongside, the\r\nbubble at the stem and stern, or the hum of the wind through the taut\r\nrigging.\r\n\r\nWe all rushed aft to the companion, and at that instant Antonio\r\nsprang up the cabin stair.  By the clear splendor of the tropical\r\nmoonlight, we could see that his usually swarthy visage was pale as\r\ndeath, while his black eyes blazed like two burning coals.  He\r\ngrasped his unsheathed knife, the blade of which, as well as his\r\nhands and clothes, were covered with blood!\r\n\r\nMy heart grew sick with vague apprehension, and my first thought was\r\nfor a weapon; but none was near.\r\n\r\n\"What have you been about, you rascally picaroon,--and why did you\r\nleave the wheel?\" shouted Lambourne, becoming greatly excited; \"the\r\nmasts might have gone by the board,--what devil's work have you been\r\nafter below?\"\r\n\r\nThen the dark Spanish Creole grinned, as the blood dripped from his\r\nhands on the white and moonlit deck.\r\n\r\n\"Knock him down with a handspike, Carlton,\" added Lambourne, who\r\ncould not leave the wheel; \"knock him down,--the shark-faced swab!\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Antonio drew from his breast a revolver pistol, one\r\nof a pair which we knew always hung loaded in Weston's cabin, and\r\nfired straight at the head of Carlton, who dodged the shot, which\r\nkilled the seaman, named Will White, who stood behind him.\r\n\r\nThe ball pierced the brain of the poor fellow, who bounded\r\nconvulsively, nearly three feet from the deck; he fell heavily on his\r\nface, and never moved again, for he was dead,--dead as a stone!\r\n\r\nIn its suddenness, this terrible deed paralyzed us with horror, not\r\nunmixed with fear, as we were all unarmed and completely in the power\r\nof this Spanish demon, the report of whose pistol brought all the\r\nstartled crew, tumbling over each other, out of the forecastle.\r\n\r\n\"Aha, maldita!  Santos y Angeles!\" said the Spaniard, waving the\r\npistol, the muzzle of which yet smoked, toward us in a half circle,\r\nas a warning for all to stand back; \"did you think to run your rigs\r\nupon me?  I am Antonio el Cubano, and don't value you all a\r\nrope's-end or a rotten castano, as you shall find.  I am now the\r\ncaptain of this ship, and shall force you all to obey me, or\r\nelse\"--here he swore one of those sonorous and blasphemous oaths\r\nwhich run so glibly from a Spanish tongue--\"I will shoot you all in\r\nsuccession, till I am the last man left on board; and when I am tired\r\nof the ship I can burn or scuttle her.  Do you understand all this?\"\r\n\r\nDead silence followed this strange address, the half of which was\r\nscarcely understood by our men, as it was said in Spanish.\r\n\r\n\"Basta!\" (avast) \"I see that you _do_ understand,\" he resumed; \"and\r\nnow begin by obedience.  Throw this carrion--this _bestia\r\nmuerta_--overboard.\"\r\n\r\nBut perceiving how we all shrunk back,--\r\n\r\n\"Overboard with him,\" he added, brutally kicking the inanimate body\r\nof poor Will White; \"or demonio, I shall send the first who disobeys\r\nme to keep him company!\"\r\n\r\nHe grasped me by the arm, his hateful clutch was firm as a smith's\r\nvice; and then he levelled his pistol at the head of Ned Carlton.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the latter stood irresolute, and then seeing the black\r\nmuzzle of the revolver within a foot of his head, he muttered a deep\r\nmalediction, stamped his foot with rage on the deck, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Rodney, bear a hand with me to launch this murdered man,--this\r\npoor fellow overboard!\"\r\n\r\n\"Obey!\" thundered Antonio.\r\n\r\nLike one in a dream I bent over the dead man, on whose pale face,\r\nglazed eyes, and relaxed jaw, the bright moonlight was shining, and\r\nin my excitement and bewilderment, I nearly slipped and fell in the\r\npool of blood which flowed from his death wound.\r\n\r\nI had never touched a corpse before, and an irrepressible shudder ran\r\nthrough all my veins.  But that emotion once over, I could have\r\nhandled a dozen, with perhaps indifference; and there are few who,\r\nafter touching the dead, have not experienced this change of feeling.\r\n\r\nNed Carlton, with a sound like a sob in his honest breast--a sob of\r\nmingled rage and commiseration--raised the yet warm body; I took the\r\nfeet, and through one of the quarter-boards, which was open, we\r\nlaunched it into the great deep, and as the brig flew on, rolling\r\nbefore the early morning wind, there remained no trace of poor Will\r\nWhite but his blood, a dark pool upon the deck; and the crew stood\r\nstaring at it and at each other with blank irresolution, horror, and\r\ndismay expressed in all their faces.\r\n\r\nEmpty-handed and defenceless as we all were, each was afraid to speak\r\nor act, lest he might be the next victim whom the merciless Cubano\r\nwould shoot down.\r\n\r\nWith a growl of defiance Antonio now turned away, and brandishing the\r\nrevolver in token of the obedience he meant to exact, he descended\r\nslowly into the cabin, where we soon heard him smashing open the\r\nlockers, and busy with the case-bottles in the steward's locker, or\r\nBilly the cabin-boy's pantry.\r\n\r\nHis departure seemed a relief to all, but in half a minute after he\r\nwas gone below, little Billy, or \"boy Bill,\" as he was usually\r\ntermed, whose sleeping place was the steerage, rushed up the cabin\r\nstair in his shirt, and ran among us, sobbing with fear and dismay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nCONFERENCE OF THE CREW.\r\n\r\nSome time elapsed before the poor boy became sufficiently coherent to\r\nbe understood, but it would seem that on hearing the first cry, which\r\nhad alarmed me, he sprang out of his berth, which was at the foot of\r\nthe companionway, and on looking into the cabin, he saw by the night\r\nlamp which swung in the skylight, the Cubano armed with a bloody\r\nknife, rush from the captain's state-room into that of the mate,\r\nwhich was opposite.\r\n\r\nAnother choking cry acquainted him that Antonio had stabbed Hislop in\r\nhis sleep; and fearing that his own turn would come next, he had\r\ncrept into an empty cask which lay below the companion-ladder, and\r\nremained there, trembling with dread, until he took an opportunity of\r\nrushing on deck and joining us.\r\n\r\nThis terrible revelation added to our dismay.\r\n\r\nWe were now in a desperate predicament, without a captain or mate to\r\nnavigate the brig, and at the mercy of a well-armed desperado, to\r\nwhom homicide was a pastime; thus, all who had handled him so\r\nseverely on the night we crossed the line began to feel no small\r\ndegree of alarm for their own safety, being certain that more blood\r\nwould be shed the moment he came on deck.\r\n\r\nAll dressed themselves with the utmost expedition, and it was\r\nresolved to hold a council of war.  Lambourne was still at the wheel;\r\nand to be prepared for any emergency, he resolved to reduce the\r\ncanvas on the brig.  So the royals were sent down, all studding-sails\r\ntaken in, and the topsails were handed: all this was done as quietly\r\nas possible, lest any sound might rouse the fiend who seemed now to\r\npossess the _Eugenie_.\r\n\r\nLambourne ventured to peep down the skylight, when he saw Antonio\r\ndrinking brandy from a case-bottle, without troubling himself with a\r\nglass.  Then the Spaniard proceeded to attire himself in the best\r\nclothes of Captain Weston; he forced open several lockfast places,\r\nand took from them money and jewelry, which he concealed about his\r\nperson.  What his ultimate object could be in performing these acts\r\nof plunder on the open sea, we could neither conceive nor divine, but\r\non chancing to glance upward, he caught a glimpse of Tom's eyes\r\npeering down.\r\n\r\nThere was an explosion, a crashing of glass, and a ball from a\r\nrevolver, fired upward, grazed Tom's left ear and pierced the rim of\r\nhis sou'-wester as a hint that our Cubano had no intention of being\r\noverlooked in his operations below.\r\n\r\nWe heard him close the cabin door with a bang, and after locking it,\r\nthrow himself on the floor behind it, with the intention of sleeping\r\nprobably, but with the full resolution that no one should enter\r\nwithout disturbing him; and in this way, after examining his pistols,\r\nhe reposed every night afterwards while on board.\r\n\r\n\"By jingo!  I thought the killing o' them birds would lead to bad\r\nluck somehow,\" said Henry Warren, an old foremast man, with a\r\nreproachful glance at me, as he threw the two albatrosses overboard.\r\n\r\nWe now held a solemn conference to meet the emergency which was\r\ncertain to come anon, and to consider the best means of subduing and\r\ndisarming the culprit.\r\n\r\n\"Whoever goes nigh him in the cabin, either by the door or the\r\nskylight, risks being stabbed or shot,\" said Tattooed Tom; \"so we\r\nmust go to work some other way, shipmates, and that other way must be\r\nconsidered.\"\r\n\r\n\"We might close and batten the skylight and companion, and then\r\nstarve or smoke him out,\" suggested one of the crew, Francis Probart,\r\nour carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"Smoke him out?\" echoed Tom.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, as we do rats.\"\r\n\r\n\"By what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fill a bucket with spun-yarn, and greased flax, with sulphur and\r\nbilge-water--ain't that the medical compound for rats----\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" said Tom; \"you would burn the ship----\"\r\n\r\n\"As he has often threatened to do,\" said Carlton, \"and may do yet.\"\r\n\r\nA most extraordinary scheme was proposed by one man, that we should\r\nlaunch the longboat, throw into her some bags of bread and gang-casks\r\nof water, unship the compass, double-bank the oars, and shove off for\r\nthe coast of South America, after scuttling the brig and leaving\r\nAntonio to his fate.\r\n\r\nWe were in a horrible state of perplexity, and I seemed to see\r\nconstantly before me the gashed bodies of my two kind, brave, and\r\nhospitable friends--Captain Weston and Marc Hislop--lying in their\r\nberths dead and unavenged, with their destroyer beside them!\r\n\r\nWe had the capstan-bars, and with these it was proposed to assail him\r\nwhen next he came on deck.  Then we had the carpenter's tools, among\r\nwhich a hand-saw, an auger, an adze, and a hatchet, made very\r\navailable weapons, and these, with the old cutlass and harpoons which\r\nfigured on the night we crossed the line, were speedily appropriated.\r\nI was armed with a heavy claw-hammer, and, vowing firmly to stand by\r\neach other, we resolved to lynch Antonio the moment he came out of\r\nhis den.\r\n\r\nWhile we were thus employed in devising the means of punishment, the\r\ndark shadows of night passed away; the morning sun came up in his\r\ntropical splendor, and the blue waves of the southern sea rolled\r\naround us in light, but not a sail was visible on their vast expanse.\r\n\r\nThe crew seemed pale and excited, as they might well be, and by\r\nbuckets of water we cleansed the deck from the blood that stained it.\r\n\r\nThe morning advanced into noon, and the vessel was steered her due\r\ncourse, for the wind was still fair.  Ned Carlton was at the wheel,\r\nand the men were all grouped forward, when suddenly Antonio appeared\r\non deck with a knife in his sash and a revolver in each hand.\r\n\r\nHe was so pale that his olive face seemed almost a pea-green, and a\r\nblack crust upon his cruel lips showed the extent of his potations in\r\nthe cabin.  He glanced into the binnacle, and perceiving that the\r\nbrig was still being steered her old course, he cried, in a hoarse\r\nvoice,--\r\n\r\n\"Hombres, allegarse a la cuesta!\" (men, bear toward the land), and\r\npointing to the direction in which he knew the vast continent of\r\nSouth America--from which we were probably four or five hundred miles\r\ndistant--must be, he added orders in English to shape the brig's\r\ncourse due west, and stamped his right foot on the deck to give his\r\nwords additional force.\r\n\r\nHe took us so suddenly by surprise, that, although we had been\r\nwaiting and watching for him since dawn, his resolute aspect and the\r\narms he wielded controlled us all, and we stared at each other with\r\nirresolution in our purpose and in our faces.  No man, apparently,\r\ncared to act as leader.\r\n\r\n\"Presto!\" roared the Cubano; \"obey and keep quiet, or, demonio! as\r\nthere are so many, I have a great mind to shoot one half, that I may\r\nbe able to control the rest.  Cast loose those topsails, and up with\r\nthe royals again--set the flying-gib, and main trysail--quick,\r\nperros, or I'll make shark's meat of some more of you!\"\r\n\r\nThe crew seemed to lack either resolution or the power of\r\ncombination, and no man appeared anxious to incur the sure penalty of\r\ninstant death by acting in opposition to his peremptory orders in\r\nsetting an example to the rest.  So, sullenly and silently the sail\r\ntrimmers stood by the tacks and braces; the wheel revolved in the\r\nunwilling hands of Ned Carlton, who was compelled to obey, for the\r\ncold muzzle of a six-barrelled revolver, capped and cocked, was held\r\nclose to his left temple.\r\n\r\nThe head of the _Eugenie_ payed off in obedience to her helm, the\r\nyards swung round and were braced sharp up; and with the starboard\r\ntacks on board, in three minutes we were steering as due westward as\r\nher head would lie for the coast of South America.\r\n\r\nThis alteration of our course furnished the crew with a new source of\r\nspeculation.  It was evidently the intention of Antonio, if he could\r\nreach the coast of Seguro, or that of Bahia, to escape with all his\r\nvaluables and his vengeance; and to this end, if ships passed without\r\nsuccoring or overhauling us, and if we did not destroy him, he might\r\ncertainly destroy us, by scuttling the brig, or setting her on fire.\r\n\r\nThe noon passed over without an \"observation,\" for there was no one\r\nto work it, to estimate the latitude or longitude, to keep a\r\nreckoning, or take note of our variation and leeway; and lest we\r\nshould signal any passing ship, Antonio, who was a most thoughtful\r\nscoundrel, threw every color we had overboard.  He did not come on\r\ndeck again for some time, as he had plenty of spirits and provisions\r\nbelow, and the tell-tale compass in the skylight afforded him\r\nconstant information as to whether the brig was steered in the\r\ndirection he wished.\r\n\r\nHe was constantly drinking, but never became so intoxicated as to be\r\nunwary.\r\n\r\nAnd so the fated brig glided over the hot sea, under the blazing sun.\r\nThe albatrosses came round us again, with tripping feet, flapping\r\nwings, and open bills; but no one molested them now--we had other\r\nthings to think of; and as I sat on the anchor stock in the weather\r\nbow, watching them floating in the water, or skimming over it with\r\ntheir vast wings outspread, I thought of the \"Ancient Mariner,\" and\r\nall that he had suffered for killing \"the bird of good omen.\"\r\n\r\nI felt a strange dread creeping over me while these verses seemed on\r\nmy tongue--they were so descriptive of the atmosphere and of our\r\nsituation:\r\n\r\n  \"All in a hot and copper sky,\r\n    The bloody sun at noon,\r\n  Right up above the mast did stand,\r\n    No bigger than the moon.\r\n\r\n  * * * *\r\n\r\n  \"I closed my lids, and kept them close,\r\n    And the balls like pulses beat,\r\n  For the sea and sky, and the sea and sky,\r\n  Lay like a load on my weary eye,\r\n    And the dead were at my feet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nI CONFRONT THE CUBANO.\r\n\r\nFrom the wild thoughts and fancies which the horrors of that early\r\nmorning, our strange situation, and my own rather active imagination,\r\nwere suggesting, I was roused by Ned Carlton, who, on being relieved\r\nfrom the wheel, came forward to the bows, where most of the crew were\r\nseated on the windlass, or were lounging against the bitts,\r\nspeculating on what might turn up next.\r\n\r\nIn an excited and impressive manner, he reported that he had heard,\r\nfrom time to time, the sound of moans, as from some one in great pain\r\nin the cabin; that he believed that either the captain or mate yet\r\nsurvived; and if we could get down by any means we might be in time\r\nto save one or other.  If he was bleeding to death, the victim could\r\nnot last long,--a little time, and we should be too late!\r\n\r\nThis information increased our anxiety, and greatly excited us.\r\n\r\nRemembering the manner in which Antonio first came on board--the\r\nmystery of his being alone in the blood-stained boat--his dreams--the\r\ndisappearance of Roberts--the occurrences of the morning--and though\r\nlast not least, the rough treatment to which the crew had subjected\r\nhim on the night we passed the line,--none were very willing to enter\r\nthe cabin where this savage Cubano, flushed with brandy, bloodshed,\r\nand ferocity, sat with loaded pistols in his hands.  But all felt\r\nthat something must be done; that, while a doubt remained, it should\r\nbe solved, and a life so important to us saved, even though others be\r\nrisked for it.\r\n\r\nI volunteered to become the envoy of the crew.\r\n\r\n\"No, no, Master Rodney,\" said Tattooed Tom; \"this will never do!\r\nWhat, do you think we will let you venture into that murderer's den\r\nwhile so many able-bodied fellows hang astern?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I know his language, which none of you do.\"\r\n\r\n\"He speaks the Queen's English now as well as any of us,\" said\r\nCarlton; \"and if I had only a pistol or a musket to give me but one\r\nchance for my life, I would have made _it_ speak to him long ago, in\r\nthe lingo such pirates know best.\"\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, as I did not molest him on the night we crossed the line,\r\nhe has no particular grudge at _me_?\" I urged.\r\n\r\n\"There is some sense and truth in that,\" muttered several of the crew.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go--it is settled,\" said I, anxious to solve the mystery of the\r\ngroans, while feeling a glow of triumph at the applause I should gain\r\nfor the risk I ran, which assuredly was not a small one.\r\n\r\n\"It is a shame for us lubberly fellows to stand by here and see that\r\nlad risk his life,\" said Probart, one of the crew; \"and if so be that\r\nCreole picaroon falls foul of him----\"\r\n\r\n\"If he does,\" exclaimed Tom Lambourne through his firmly set teeth,\r\nwhile striking his clenched right hand on the hard palm of the left,\r\n\"may I never see England again if we don't attack him both at stem\r\nand stern at once!  I'll drop down the skylight, with as many as will\r\nfollow me, while you, Ned, will dash down the companionway with the\r\nrest, and then at him with hatchet, handsaw, and capstan-bar.  He\r\ncan't kill us _all_, shipmates, that's one comfort--he can't kill us\r\nall!\"\r\n\r\nThe prospect of an early demise was neither soothed nor encouraged by\r\nthis promise of the bloody scene that was to follow.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter gave me a small but very sharp tomahawk.  I concealed\r\nit in my breast, and resolved to use it to some purpose if molested\r\nin the cabin.  The idea flashed upon me that by one determined blow I\r\nmight disable him forever, and perhaps do an act of justice by\r\ndispatching him outright.\r\n\r\nWith a vague sense that I was about to face a terrible danger, and\r\nthat the sooner it was faced and past, the better, I walked hastily\r\naft, and on descending the companion-ladder, paused when half-way\r\ndown, and after knocking on the bulkhead called out distinctly and\r\nboldly,--\r\n\r\n\"Antonio!  Hallo, Cubano!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what do you want?\" asked he, sulkily.\r\n\r\n\"To speak with you; may I come down?\"\r\n\r\n\"Enter companero; you have not yet harmed me, thus I bear you no\r\nmalice.\"\r\n\r\nPutting a hand in my breast to ascertain that my little hatchet was\r\nsecure, I entered the cabin, where the Cubano, with his broad back\r\nplaced against the rudder-case, was seated on the stern-locker at the\r\ntable, which he had covered with bottles, biscuits, cheese, and\r\npolonies, while papers, dockets, broken desks and boxes, lay\r\nscattered about him.  He was clad, as I have stated, in the poor\r\nskipper's best shore-going suit of clothes, which he wore open and\r\nloose, for the atmosphere of the cabin, notwithstanding the shattered\r\nskylight, was oppressively hot, as the sun was now almost vertical;\r\nthe flies were in noisy swarms, and the cockroaches were crawling\r\nover all the beams and bulkhead panels.\r\n\r\nOn first hearing a foot on the companion-ladder, he had evidently\r\nsnatched up a revolver, and cocked it; but on finding that his\r\nvisitor was only me, he put it down, threw away the fag-end of a\r\ncigarito, and said, with a ferocious grin and ironical politeness,--\r\n\r\n\"Buenos dias (a good day), senor; to what am I indebted for this\r\nvisit?\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first time I had ever looked in the face of a man who had\r\ncoolly destroyed a fellow-being as he had done, and my flesh seemed\r\nto creep with an indescribable loathing; but I had a purpose to\r\nachieve, and determined to do it.\r\n\r\nI was about to enter Weston's state-room, when the Cubano cocked his\r\nrevolver and cried, in a voice of thunder,--\r\n\r\n\"Come back, or I will shoot you as dead as he is!  Ha, ha! _por\r\ngrados_\" (by degrees) \"I shall get rid of you all.\"\r\n\r\nI paused and looked at him; my young heart beat wildly; I felt that I\r\nwas facing death, and what would I not have given had my hatchet been\r\na pistol, even with _one_ barrel, though my opponent was master of\r\ntwelve charges.\r\n\r\n\"He is dead then?\" said I, in a husky voice.\r\n\r\n\"Who--which?\" asked the Cubano, with a fresh cigarito between his\r\nstrong white teeth.\r\n\r\n\"Captain Weston.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye, dead as Judas!\" said he, laughing hoarsely.\r\n\r\n\"But I understand that Hislop--\" I stammered.\r\n\r\n\"El contra-maestre--well?\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment, a low moan which went through my heart, came from the\r\nstate-room or little side cabin of Marc Hislop.\r\n\r\n\"Well, hombre, what of him?\" growled Antonio.\r\n\r\n\"He is bleeding to death, and I wish to remove him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do as you please, he will be food for the fish before the sun sets.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will allow me to take him on deck?\" said I, earnestly, almost\r\nimploringly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; you have done me no harm;\" (he repeated this very often) \"woe\r\nto those who have done so!\"\r\n\r\nA gleam of suspicion flashed in the eyes of Antonio as he said--\r\n\r\n\"True; but not a man shall enter here, and leave alive.  The\r\nship-boys may assist you; but I will shoot the whole crew down like\r\ndogs, if they venture to approach me; so I give you five minutes to\r\ncarry the contra-maestre to the forecastle bunks, or to pitch him\r\noverboard, whichever you please, though the last would please _me_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Five minutes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, five by this watch,\" he added, pulling out of his fob a gold\r\nrepeater, which, even in the excitement of the moment, I recognized\r\nto be mine, the same which my mother gave me, when I first left home\r\nfor Eton, and of which I had been robbed at Teneriffe.  There was no\r\ndoubting the little rings and charms which my sisters Dot, Sybil, and\r\none of their female friends had appended to it; and thus I discovered\r\nanother black link in the life of Antonio.\r\n\r\nI dared not appear to recognize it when his strong, brown, hairy\r\nhand, the bloody spots on which made me shudder, held it toward me,\r\nlest he might shoot me down, but summoned Billy Wilkins, the cabin\r\nboy, by desiring the man at the wheel, \"to pass word forward for him\r\nand another apprentice.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys came, but not without great fear and reluctance; and while\r\nAntonio proceeded leisurely to make another paper cigar, keeping his\r\nears open for every sound, and his black eyes fixed keenly on us the\r\nwhile, we entered the little state-room of Marc Hislop, and beheld a\r\nsight which filled us with the deepest commiseration and dismay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nI RESCUE THE MATE.\r\n\r\nPale as marble, with his lower jaw relaxed and his eyes almost\r\nclosed, motionless as if dead, but, nevertheless, still breathing\r\nslowly and heavily, poor Marc Hislop lay in his bed, the clothes and\r\npillows of which were saturated with blood; for he seemed to be\r\ncovered by wounds, and the crimson current had flowed over the piles\r\nof his favorite books, which were scattered upon the cabin floor,\r\nwhere they had been trod under foot by Antonio while overhauling the\r\nrepositories of the unfortunate proprietor.\r\n\r\nShuddering, and in haste, we lifted him from the bed, muffled him in\r\na blanket, and conveyed him, passive as a child, in our hands, from\r\nthe cabin.\r\n\r\nAs we passed out, for a moment it seemed as if the ruffianly Spaniard\r\nrepented of his temporary clemency; for when he saw the pale, bloody,\r\nand insensible form of the poor fellow trailed past, he made an\r\nominous stride toward us, and threateningly clutched the haft of the\r\nAlbacete knife in his sash.  Then waving his hand, almost\r\ncontemptuously, he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Basta--go, go--it matters little now, either to him or to me.\r\nDemonio!  I always strike deep.\"\r\n\r\nAlarm and pity endowed us with unusual strength, and we bore the\r\nspeechless victim of Antonio up the steep stair to the deck, where\r\nour crew, with muttered oaths of vengeance, and expressions of\r\ncommiseration, bore him into the forepart of the vessel.  There a bed\r\nwas made up for him on deck; for coolness, an awning was rigged over\r\nit, and we had his wounds examined.\r\n\r\nWe found a deep stab in the neck, most dangerously near the jugular\r\nvein; a second in the breast, a third between the bones of the right\r\nforearm, and a fourth in the left thigh; all had evidently been dealt\r\nthrough the bedclothes, and with a savage energy of purpose.\r\n\r\n\"The poor lad is dying for lack of a doctor,\" said old Tom, who knelt\r\nbeside Hislop, handling his wounds with the tenderness of a woman;\r\n\"and if the whole British navy hove in sight, we haven't a rag of\r\nbunting to shake out as a signal, since that rascally picaroon, the\r\nCubano, has cast every color and signal overboard.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Tom, he shan't die this bout,\" said Ned Carlton, hopefully;\r\n\"let us tie up his wounds as best we can, to belay the bleeding, and\r\ngive him something as a reviver.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a blessing his old mother in Scotland don't see all this,\"\r\nadded rough Tom Lambourne, with a tear in his eye; \"poor Marc Hislop\r\nis her only support, and a sister's too.\"\r\n\r\nI thought now with compunction, how often his theories and pedantry\r\nhad bored me, and I resolved to be unremitting in my care of him.\r\n\r\nThe united medical skill of those honest souls, our crew, was very\r\nsmall; however, the wounds were carefully washed in clean water;\r\ntheir best shirts were torn into bandages, or folded into pads to\r\nstop the bleeding; and in this they were quite successful.\r\n\r\nA breaker of New England rum was hoisted out of the forehold, and its\r\nhead was instantly started.  The liquor was very redolent of treacle;\r\nbut a glass of it mixed with water--the readiest stimulant that\r\noccurred to the minds of the seamen--was poured between the parched\r\nlips of the sufferer, who at last slept, in the pleasant atmosphere\r\nformed by the awning which shaded him from the fierce sun, and in the\r\nbreeze that whistled past the bows as the _Eugenie_ still bore on her\r\nnew course, close hauled, with all her fore-and-aft canvas set, and\r\nthe white glittering spray flying over her cat-heads and dolphin\r\nstriker.\r\n\r\nThe terrible Cubano still kept possession of the cabin.  His two\r\nsix-barrelled revolvers gave him twelve shots, and we were but nine\r\nin all, as the captain, Roberts, and Will White had already perished\r\nby his hand, and Hislop to all appearance was dying; thus Antonio\r\nkept us all in subjection by his weapons, just as half a dozen\r\nwell-armed soldiers may control a mob of thousands.\r\n\r\nSo passed the night; the crew grouped forward, full of schemes for\r\nvengeance, and he aft, full of triumph, ferocity, and cognac.\r\n\r\nNext morning, I was on the quarter-deck, and when day broke, I became\r\naware, by a plashing sound astern, that we were towing something in\r\nthe dead water of the brig's wake.  On looking over the taffrail,\r\nwhat were my emotions on beholding the body of my kind friend\r\nWeston--our good and hospitable captain--towed by the neck at the end\r\nof a line!\r\n\r\nAround the poor corpse, which was in its night-dress, the green waves\r\ndanced merrily in the golden light of the morning sun that was now\r\nbeaming over the sea, \"refreshing the distant shores and reviving all\r\nbut him.\"  Antonio in the night had cast it from one of the cabin\r\nwindows on the port side of the rudder-case, and through that\r\naperture the line to which it was attached was now run.\r\n\r\nBy the smoke of a cigar which ascended to the taffrail at times, I\r\ndiscovered that the atrocious Cubano was sitting at the open cabin\r\nwindow below me, watching and waiting to see the body devoured by\r\nsharks; and I knew that he would shoot all who attempted to cross his\r\npurpose, or who came within reach of his pistol.  This prevented any\r\nman from lowering himself over the stem, either to haul in the line\r\nor cut it adrift.\r\n\r\n\"Demonio!\" we heard him exclaim, when, by a sudden lurch of the ship,\r\nthe line parted, and the poor corpse went rolling and surging to\r\nleeward.\r\n\r\n\"There he goes, and God bless him, although he's cut adrift without a\r\nprayer or a sailor's winding-sheet,\" said Tom Lambourne, taking off\r\nhis hat, as the body bobbed like a fisherman's float on the waves for\r\na little space, and then disappeared in the long white track made by\r\nthe _Eugenie_, through the dark apple-green of the morning sea.\r\n\r\nAll the stories I had heard or read of Spanish revenge seemed\r\neclipsed by the atrocities of this fiendish Cubano.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHE REQUITAL.\r\n\r\nThree days and nights passed after this without finding us able to\r\nsurprise or dislodge the demon who was in possession of the cabin;\r\nwithout our knowing where the ship was driving or drifting to, and\r\nwithout a sail appearing.  A man-of-war belonging to any country we\r\nshould have hailed as a protector; but on the wide waters of the\r\nSouthern Atlantic ships are few and far between.\r\n\r\nHislop rallied a little, and was removed into one of the forecastle\r\nberths.  He could tell us only that he had been surprised when\r\nasleep, and been stabbed again and again--that he became insensible,\r\nand remembered nothing more.  His distress was great when we related\r\nthe story of the captain's fate, the death of Will White, and that\r\ntheir destroyer was still in possession of the ship, and the arbiter\r\nof all our lives.\r\n\r\nHe writhed on his bed of pain, and sighed bitterly on finding how\r\nstiff and sore, how weak and almost blind he had become by loss of\r\nblood; but a crisis was now at hand with our Cubano.\r\n\r\nThe evening of the fourth day after we had saved Hislop found the\r\nbrig still lying a westerly course; but whether in the latitude of\r\nCape San Roque or of the Rio Grande, we knew not; and, I suppose, it\r\nwas all the same to Antonio.\r\n\r\nI was at the wheel.  The sunset was gorgeously beautiful.  The\r\n_Eugenie_ was running with both tacks aft; and under the arched leech\r\nof her courses I could see the blood-red disk of the sun right ahead\r\nsetting in the waves, which shone in all the colors of the dying\r\ndolphin; while against the flaming orb, the black outline of the\r\nmasts, the figure-head, and the taper end of the jibboom, with its\r\ncap, guys, and gear, were clearly and distinctly defined.\r\n\r\nThe waves ahead rose and fell between me and the sun, as slowly and\r\nimperceptibly he sank at the flaming horizon, from a quarter circle\r\nto a segment; then the last vestige of that also disappeared, but the\r\nlingering rays of his glory played upward on the light clouds that\r\nfloated above.  Even they paled away and died out, and twilight stole\r\nover the silent sea, which changed from gold to a transparent blue.\r\n\r\nWith the increasing twilight came a change of wind, and before it a\r\ngreat bank of cloud rolled from the horizon on our starboard bow.\r\nUnder its shadow the sea was darkened, and its broken water flecked\r\nwith white.  The new breeze came first upon our quarter, then rapidly\r\nit was abeam, and three great albatrosses were seen to whip the sea\r\nwith their wings, while a whole shoal of brown porpoises surged past\r\nour bows, plunging joyously from wave to wave.\r\n\r\nTacks and braces were instantly manned, and the sails were trimmed\r\nanew for our desultory course.\r\n\r\n\"Sail ho--to windward!\" said one of the crew, in a low but excited\r\nvoice, lest the sound might reach the cabin; and as the dense bank of\r\npurple cloud opened, a large bark came out of it, and her form became\r\nmore and more defined as she left the vapor astern.  She was going\r\nfree--that is, with her head further off the wind than\r\nclose-hauled--and had a press of snow-white canvas, which shone in\r\nthe last light of the west.\r\n\r\n\"She is four miles off,\" said Carlton.\r\n\r\n\"We must signal her,\" added Lambourne.\r\n\r\n\"With what?\" asked Carlton, in the same sharp but low voice; \"every\r\ncolor is overboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Any thing will do--a blue shirt at the foremast head; quick!--the\r\nsky will be quite dark in ten minutes.  Run it up in a ball with a\r\nslipping loop, man-o'-war fashion,\" said Lambourne in a loud whisper;\r\n\"get ready a ship's lantern some of you, for the night darkens so\r\nfast that we shall scarcely be visible when she is abeam of us.  Ned,\r\nget into the fore-channel, and wave the light as a signal that we\r\nwant a boat.\"\r\n\r\nThese orders were rapidly obeyed, and preparations made to throw the\r\nbrig in the wind.  While one man hastily got the lantern from a\r\nlittle round house, in which certain stores and tools were kept on\r\ndeck, Ned Carlton pulled off his shirt, and was in the act of binding\r\nit to the signal halyards, when the Spaniard, whose quick ears\r\ndetected some commotion, sprang on deck, armed as usual.\r\n\r\nOn seeing Carlton busy with the halyards, he looked round, caught\r\nsight of the ship, which was running with the white foam boiling\r\nunder her forefoot, and thus in a moment divined what we were about.\r\n\r\nMuttering a terrible imprecation in Spanish, he fired at Carlton, but\r\nmissed him as before, and shot dead a poor apprentice who was close\r\nby.\r\n\r\n\"'Tarnal thunder, flesh and blood can't bear this!\" shouted Tom\r\nLambourne, whose fury was boundless, and who snatched up a\r\ncapstan-bar.  \"Bear down on him all hands: there is neither sea law\r\nnor land law can help us here!\"\r\n\r\nSnatching whatever came nearest to hand, we all rushed upon the\r\nCubano, who stood boldly at bay, and keeping the binnacle between us\r\nand him, fired over it five or six shots from his revolver with\r\nterrible rapidity; but so unsteady had his hand become in consequence\r\nof his free potations below, that every bullet missed, though one cut\r\nthe knuckles of Tom Lambourne's right hand, and another tore away the\r\nrim of my straw hat.\r\n\r\nHe drew a second revolver from his sash, but Lambourne, by one lucky\r\nblow with the capstan-bar, knocked it out of his hand.  It went\r\ntwenty feet into the air, and fell overboard.\r\n\r\nQuick as lightning, Antonio placed the other in his breast, drew his\r\nknife, stooped his head, and darting through us like an eel, gave\r\nCarlton a gash in the thigh as he passed.\r\n\r\nHe then made for the main-rigging, and sprang on the bulwark, no\r\ndoubt with the intention of running up aloft to some secure perch,\r\nwhere he might reload his remaining pistol, and shoot us all down at\r\nleisure; but he missed his hold of the rattlins, and fell overboard!\r\n\r\nThere was a shout of furious joy.\r\n\r\n\"The sea will rob the gallows of its due!\" said Carlton; \"but he'll\r\nbe shark's meat, any way.\"\r\n\r\nBut Antonio was not gone yet, for in falling he caught one of the\r\nlower studding-sail booms, and clutched it with deadly tenacity, for\r\nhe knew that if once he was fairly launched into the ocean his fate\r\nwould be sealed.\r\n\r\nHis face was pale with combined fear and fury; his black eyes blazed\r\nwith the fire of hatred; the perspiration oozed in drops upon his\r\ntemples.  Tom Lambourne sprang forward to beat off his fingers; but\r\nat that moment, the boom, a slender spar, broke from its lashings\r\nalongside and swung out at a _right angle_ from the brig, with the\r\nwretch at the extreme end of it, dangling over the waves, like a\r\nherring at the point of a ramrod.\r\n\r\nAgain and again he writhed his body upward in wild struggles to get\r\nastride the boom, or to reach it with his knees, but in vain!\r\n\r\nInstead of exciting pity, his terrible situation drew forth a shout\r\nof derision, mingled with expressions of hatred and satisfaction,\r\nfrom the line of avenging faces that surveyed him over the bulwark.\r\nHe hung thus for fully five minutes, for he was a powerful man, of\r\ngreat strength, muscle, and bulk.\r\n\r\nI have no doubt this man was as brave as it is possible for a ruffian\r\nto be; but the prospect of an immediate death--a death, too, from\r\nwhich there was no escape--terrified him.\r\n\r\nHis glance of hate toward us turned to one of wild and earnest\r\nentreaty.\r\n\r\n\"Mercy!--pardon!--in the name and for the love of the Almighty!\" he\r\nexclaimed in Spanish, in a tone of intense earnestness; but he was\r\nheard by us with fierce derision in that moment of just triumph and\r\ntoo long delayed vengeance.\r\n\r\nTwice the _Eugenie_ gave a lee lurch, and each time the feet and\r\nknees of the wretched Cubano were immersed in the waves.\r\n\r\nBeneath him was the abyss of water that rushed past the side of the\r\nbrig.  He panted rather than breathed; and through the dusk we could\r\nsee how his aching hands turned white as his face; and that the\r\npoints of his fingers were blood-red.  His eyes grew wild and haggard\r\nas terror chilled his coward heart and agonized his soul; and yet\r\nthrough the surge the fleet craft flew on!\r\n\r\nEvery moment increased the weight of his body and the weakness of his\r\nhands and wrists.\r\n\r\nAt last it was evident that his powers of endurance could be no\r\nlonger taxed; he uttered a half-smothered shriek, and closed his eyes\r\nas he clung to that slender spar, and it swayed to and fro while the\r\nclose-hauled brig flew on!\r\n\r\nThere was a crash!\r\n\r\nThe iron hook in the bulwark on which the studding-sail boom was\r\nhung, gave way under the double weight of the spar and of his body.\r\nThere was a shrill cry of despair, like the parting shriek of an evil\r\nspirit, on the skirt of the gusty blast, as the boom, and the wretch\r\nwho clung to it in blind desperation, vanished into the black trough\r\nof the sea, and, like a cork or a reed, were swept amid the salt foam\r\nto leeward.\r\n\r\nThe _Eugenie_ rose like a duck upon the water, and, as if freed at\r\nthat moment from a load of crime, seemed to fly forward with\r\nincreased speed.\r\n\r\n'Twas night now, and the ship which we had first seen upon our\r\nweather bow, was a mile astern and to leeward of us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE THUNDERBOLT.\r\n\r\nAn emotion of mingled freedom and satisfaction possessed the whole\r\ncrew on being rid of our tormentor, and Lambourne now took charge of\r\nthe brig, which he was perfectly able to handle and work, though\r\nignorant of navigation as a science, and having but a vague idea of\r\nthe course to steer for the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nShe was hove in the wind, while in the moonlight, about two hours\r\nafter the exciting scene which closes the last chapter, we committed\r\nto the deep the body of Antonio's last victim, the poor apprentice,\r\nwhom the sailmaker sewed up in his hammock, to which, being without\r\nshot or other suitable weights, we tied a sack of coals to sink the\r\ncorpse.\r\n\r\nThe head-yards were filled again, and as if anxious to leave that\r\nportion of the sea as far as possible astern, we hauled up for the\r\nCape.  Tom Lambourne ordered every stitch of canvas that the spars\r\nwould hold, to be spread upon the _Eugenie_, that she might, as he\r\nsaid, \"walk through the water in her own style.\"\r\n\r\nAll he could do, at first, was to keep her in the course we had been\r\nsteering on the night these disasters began, for as yet we knew not\r\nto what degree of latitude, south or north, we might have been\r\ndrifting; however, we calculated that Hislop, weak as he was, might\r\nbe able to take a solar observation, and prick off our place on the\r\nchart, in the course of six or seven days.\r\n\r\nWe had the usually snug little cabin cleansed and cleared from the\r\n_débris_ created by the outrageous proceedings of Antonio, who must\r\nhave gone to the bottom with all Weston's valuables and money about\r\nhim, as we could find neither; and the sweet expression of the poor\r\nwidow's face, as it seemed to smile on us from the miniature on the\r\nafter-bulkhead, contrasted strangely with all the wild work that had\r\nso lately taken place on board.\r\n\r\nHislop and I were restored to our former berths, and then more than\r\nonce in my dreams the pale olive-green visage and glaring eyes of the\r\nCubano came before me, and again I seemed to see him clinging\r\nunpitied, and in desperation, to the slender boom which swung above\r\nthe seething sea,--for his death and all its concomitant horrors\r\nhaunted me and made me unhappy.\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the heat in that season suggested the idea that we\r\ncould not have drifted far south of the line.\r\n\r\nSo great was it, that the upper spars of the _Eugenie_ appeared to\r\nwriggle or vibrate like serpents aloft in the sunshine; while so hot,\r\nso clear, and so rarefied was the atmosphere between decks, that it\r\nwas suffocating, especially in the lullings of the faint breeze.  A\r\nwhite heat seemed to make sea and sky grow pale, and the former cast\r\nupward a reflection from its glassy surface and long smooth swells,\r\nthat was hot,--hot beyond all description.\r\n\r\nThough ever and anon the upper deck was drenched with salt water, it\r\ndried immediately, emitting a strong odor of wet wood, while the\r\nskids over the side failed to keep the paint, tar, and rosin from\r\nrising in large burnt blisters.\r\n\r\nAbout the time when we hoped that Hislop would have been well enough\r\nto make an observation, even by being placed in a chair on deck, the\r\nweather became so rough that he was unable to leave his berth, and\r\nduring all that day the brig drove before a heavy gale, with her\r\ncourses hauled close up, the fore and main-topsail yards lowered on\r\nthe caps, and their canvas close reefed.\r\n\r\nAfter the heat we had endured, the reader may imagine this gale would\r\nbe refreshing and a relief.  Not so.  The atmosphere, as it became\r\ndark with gathering clouds, increased in density, closeness, and\r\nheat; thus about the time we should have had clear twilight, the hour\r\nwas gloomy as a northern midnight,--so dark that the men in the tops,\r\nor those lying out along the foot-ropes at the yard-arms, when under\r\nclose-reefed topsails, could not be seen from the deck, while the\r\nbreeze that swept over the ocean was breathless,--hot as the simoom\r\nof the desert; and our men knew not whether they were most drenched\r\nby perspiration or the spoondrift torn from the warm wave tops by the\r\nincreasing blast.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar appearance of this black gale alarmed and bewildered\r\nTattooed Tom, who could make nothing of it, while poor Marc Hislop,\r\nwhose skill would have been invaluable to us, when he heard the\r\nsinging out on deck, the thunder of the bellying courses struggling\r\nwith their brails, the roar of the wind through the half-bared masts\r\nand rigging, the clatter of blocks and feet overhead, writhed in his\r\nbed, and mourned his own inactivity, or rather incapacity; but he\r\nsent me to tell Lambourne to cover up the anchors with wetted canvas,\r\nas it was not improbable, by the state of the atmosphere, that it was\r\nfull of electricity, and thus we might be in a dangerous way.\r\n\r\n\"Tell Tom,\" he whispered, \"it is a trade-wind gale,--I know it to be\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" I asked, \"when you are lying here below.\"\r\n\r\n\"By the barometer, which remains high, while the wind is steady,\"\r\nreplied Hislop in a low voice, for he was still very weak; \"if the\r\nbarometer _fall_, be sure it will become a typhoon, and then, with a\r\nshort-handed craft, heaven help us!  But assure Tom it is only as yet\r\na trade-wind gale,--to take as much canvas off her as he can, and to\r\nmake all snug aloft.  We'll have thunder directly, Dick,--such\r\nthunder as you can only hear in the tropics.\"\r\n\r\nHe sank back, exhausted even by these few words, while I hurried on\r\ndeck with his orders.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely conveyed them to Lambourne, who was keeping a look-out\r\nforward, when, amid the dusky obscurity of sea and sky, there burst a\r\nsudden gleam of wondrous light.\r\n\r\nThe men, who were spreading some old wetted sails over the sheet and\r\nworking anchors; the steersman at the wheel; the watch, and all hands\r\nwho were crouching to leeward, or holding on by ropes and\r\nbelaying-pins to windward, seemed for a moment to become\r\nwhite-visaged spectres, amid a sea of pale-blue flame,--a sea whereon\r\nthe flying brig with her brailed courses and reefed topsails, her\r\nhalf naked masts and black cordage, were all distinctly visible as at\r\nnoonday, while the polished brass on funnel, binnacle, and skylight,\r\nall flashed and shone, as ship and crew, with all their details of\r\nform and feature,\r\n\r\n  \"Were instant seen and instant lost.\"\r\n\r\nFor a broad and blinding sheet of electric flame burst upon the\r\ndarkness of the night, and passed away as rapidly, when the livid\r\nbrand burst in the welkin or in the wave, we knew not which.\r\n\r\nThen came the roar of thunder--the stunning and appalling thunder of\r\nthe tropics, every explosion of which seemed to rend earth, sea, and\r\nsky, as they rolled like a palpable thing, or like the united salvo\r\nof a thousand cannon overhead, to die away in rumbling echoes at the\r\nfar horizon.\r\n\r\nAfter a sound so mighty and bewildering, the bellowing of the wind\r\nthrough the rigging, the hiss and roar of the sea as wave broke\r\nagainst wave, the flapping of the brailed courses, the creaking and\r\nstraining of the timbers, seemed as nothing--the very silence of\r\ndeath--while the _Eugenie_ tore on, through mist and spray, through\r\ndarkness and obscurity, with the foam flying white as winter drift\r\nover her bows and martingale.\r\n\r\nAgain there was a pale-green gleam overhead, right above the truck of\r\nthe mainmast, where the chambers of the sky seemed to open.  The\r\nclouds divided in the darkness of heaven, and out of that opening\r\ncame the forked lightning, zigzag, green, and ghastly.\r\n\r\nThere was a dreadful shock, which knocked every man down, except\r\nCarlton, who was at the wheel, and an exclamation of terror escaped\r\nus all.\r\n\r\nA thunderbolt had struck the _Eugenie_!\r\n\r\nWith all its wondrous speed--instantaneous as electric light could\r\nbe--it glided down the maintop gallant mast, rending the topmast-cap\r\nand the framed grating of the top to pieces; thence it ran down the\r\nmainmast, burst through the deck, and spent its fury in the hold.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the main-topmast, with all its yards, gear, and\r\ncanvas, fell about the deck in burning brands, and the brig was hove\r\nright in the wind's eye, while the sea twitched the helm out of the\r\nhands of Ned Carlton, who became bewildered on finding the compasses\r\nlose all their polarity, by the influence of the electric fluid, the\r\nnorth point of one heading south-east, and of the other south-west.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after this there was a cry of \"Fire!\"--that cry so\r\nterrible, so appalling on board ship; and then thick white smoke was\r\nseen to issue from the crevices of the battened main-hatchway.\r\n\r\nAll hands rushed to this point.  The long-boat was unshipped from its\r\nchocks and dragged aft; some stood by with buckets of water, while\r\nothers struck off the padlocks and iron bars; the tarpaulin was torn\r\naway--the hatch lifted--and lo!\r\n\r\nA column of fire ascended in a straight line from the body of the\r\nhold, lurid, red, and scorching, as the casks of molasses and bales\r\nof cotton burned and blazed together.  A column that rose up between\r\nthe masts, scorched through the main-stay, all the braces of the fore\r\nyards, and filled the whole vessel with light, announced that all was\r\nover!\r\n\r\n\"It is a doomed ship!\" cried Tom Lambourne; \"we must leave her at\r\nlast.  Clear away the longboat.  Be cool, lads; be cool and steady!\r\nYour lives depend upon your conduct now, and your obedience to\r\norders!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nCAST AWAY.\r\n\r\nNot a moment was lost in getting the longboat over the side, and with\r\na heavy splash, by which it was nearly swamped, we got it afloat.\r\n\r\nNed Carlton and Probart the carpenter sprang in, to fend off and keep\r\nit from being stove or dashed to pieces by the sea, against the\r\nbrig's side.\r\n\r\nBy the wild weird glare that rose in frightful columns from the main\r\nand fore hatchways, we had plenty of light, as it shone far over the\r\nhuge billows of that dark and tempestuous sea, to which we were about\r\nto commit our fortunes; and now a pale and half-dressed figure\r\napproached us.\r\n\r\nIt was Marc Hislop, whom the terrible odor had roused from his berth\r\nin the cabin; and he now came forward, supporting his feeble steps by\r\nclutching the shrouds and belaying-pins.\r\n\r\nI rushed below and brought up a blanket and great coat to wrap him\r\nin, and he was promptly swung over into the boat, where Carlton\r\nreceived and supported him.\r\n\r\nThree bags of bread, with a tarpaulin to cover them, two kegs of rum,\r\nfour casks of water, with oars, sails, and blankets, were thrown\r\npell-mell into the boat.  A hatchet and a bundle of spun-yarn\r\ncompleted our stores.\r\n\r\nThe compasses were considered now to be useless, or were omitted, I\r\nforget which.\r\n\r\nThe wind still amounted to a gale, though less violent, and it fanned\r\nthe growing flames, so that the fated brig burned fast.  The\r\nlightning still flashed, but at the horizon, and the thunder was\r\nheard to grumble above the hiss of the sea; yet we heeded them not,\r\nthough they added to the terror and the grandeur of the scene; and,\r\nmost providentially for us, the fury of the storm was past.\r\n\r\nTattooed Tom was the last man who left the brig, and the moment he\r\nwas in the boat, he exclaimed, with a loud voice, that rang above the\r\nroaring of the flames, which now gushed through every hatchway and\r\naperture, above the howling of the wind and the breaking of the\r\nfrothy sea,--\r\n\r\n\"Shove off!--out oars, there, to starboard--pull round her\r\nstern--pull with a will to windward--keep the boat's bow to the break\r\nof the sea!\"\r\n\r\nWe pulled silently and vigorously, and soon got clear of the brig,\r\nthrough the four stern windows of which four lines of light glared\r\nredly on the ocean.\r\n\r\nAll our strength was required to achieve this, for the brig, being\r\nthe larger body, attracted the boat toward her.  However, we got\r\nsafely to windward, which was absolutely necessary, for to leeward\r\nthere fell hissing into the sea a torrent of sparks and burning\r\nbrands from the rigging, which was all in flames now.\r\n\r\nResting upon our oars, or only using them to keep the boat's head to\r\nthe break of the sea, and to prevent her being swamped--an operation\r\nduring which they were as often flourished in the air as in the\r\nocean, when we rose on the crest of one vast heaving wave, or sank\r\ninto the dark vale of water between two--resting thus, we gazed in\r\nsilence and with aching hearts at the destruction of our home upon\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nWe could _feel_ the heat of the conflagration even to windward.  In a\r\nquarter of an hour she was enveloped from stem to stern in a sheet of\r\nfire, that rose skyward in the form of a pyramid.  By this time every\r\nvestige of her spars, sails, and rigging had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThe entire deck had been consumed; the bulwarks and moulded\r\nplank-sheer rapidly followed, and through the flames that roared\r\nfiercely from the hollow of her hull, we could see the black\r\ntimberheads standing upward like a row of fangs.\r\n\r\nRents appeared next in her sides, as the flames burst through the\r\ninner and outer sheathing, and with a hissing sound as they met the\r\nwaves of the briny sea.  Then a salt steam rose, and its strange\r\nodor, with that of the burning wood, was wafted at times toward us.\r\n\r\nAt last she gave a sudden heel to starboard, and with a sound unlike\r\nany thing I ever heard before--a deluge of water extinguishing a\r\nmighty fire--the waves rushed tumultuously in on all sides.  She\r\nvanished from our sight in mist and obscurity, and a heavy darkness\r\nsuddenly replaced the glare that for a time had lit up the heaving\r\nsea, dazzling our eyes and sickening our hearts.\r\n\r\n\"All's over now,\" said Tom Lambourne, as he grasped the tiller with a\r\nfirm hand, after carefully wrapping a blanket round poor Hislop, who\r\ndrooped beside him in the stern-sheets.\r\n\r\n\"Which way shall we pull?\" asked the bow-man, as we paused with our\r\noars in the rowlocks.\r\n\r\n\"It matters little, mates,\" cried Tom, in a loud voice, with his left\r\nhand at the side of his mouth, to send what he said forward above the\r\nroar of the wind and sea.  \"We must be many hundred miles from\r\nBrazil, the nearest land, and we can do nothing now but keep our boat\r\nalive by baling and steering till daybreak.  Now, Master Hislop,\" he\r\nadded, lowering his voice, \"how do you feel, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"I feel that I am quite in your way, my lads--a useless hand aboard,\r\nto consume your food and water, replied Hislop, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir,\" said Probart, the stroke-oarsman, \"you don't think we\r\ncould have left you to burn in the poor old brig?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not exactly; still, I am of no use to you, and I feel----\"\r\n\r\n\"What, sir, what?\" asked Tom, anxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Heart sick and despairing,\" moaned Hislop letting his chin drop on\r\nhis breast.\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk so, sir,\" said Lambourne, stoutly; \"despair never found a\r\nplace in the heart of a British sailor!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Tom; and perhaps I'll gather headway, and get to\r\nwindward yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you will,\" replied Tom, cheerfully; \"but here's a sea\r\ncoming--together, lads--pull together!\"\r\n\r\nDespair might well have found a place in all our breasts at that\r\nawful crisis; but Tom's bluff and cheerful way prevented our hearts\r\nfrom sinking, though the hours of that awful night seemed dark and\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nWell, without compass, chart, or quadrant, there we were, ten in\r\nnumber, in an open boat, tossing upon a dark and stormy sea,\r\nenveloped in clouds, with the red lightning gleaming through their\r\nragged openings, or at the far and flat horizon--ignorant of where we\r\nwere, where to steer for, or what to do, and full of terrible\r\nanticipations for the _future_!\r\n\r\nWe were silent and sleepless.\r\n\r\nMy heart was full of horror, grief, and vague alarm, when I thought\r\nof my home--the quiet, the happy, and peaceful old Rectory, with all\r\nwho loved me there, and whom I might never see again.\r\n\r\nThe hot tears that started to my eyes mingled with the cold spray\r\nthat drenched my cheeks, and there seemed but one consolation for me,\r\nthat my father, my affectionate and gentle mother and sisters, dear\r\nDot and little Sybil, could never know all I had endured, or how I\r\nperished by hunger or drowning, if such were to be my fate.\r\n\r\nAll the stories I had heard or read of shipwrecked men--their\r\nsufferings, their endurance of gnawing hunger and burning thirst,\r\ntheir cannibalism, their mortal struggles with their dearest friends\r\nfor the _last_ morsel of food, for the _last_ drop of water, and how\r\nthe weak perished that the strong might live--crowded upon my memory\r\nto augment the real terrors of our situation.\r\n\r\nSo suddenly had this final catastrophe come upon us that we had\r\nconsiderable difficulty in assuring ourselves of its reality, and\r\nthat it was not a dream--a dream, alas! from which there might be no\r\nawaking.\r\n\r\nSo hour after hour passed darkly, slowly, and silently on.\r\n\r\nThe turbulence of the wind and waves abated, the lightning passed\r\naway, the scud ceased to whirl, the vapors were divided in heaven,\r\nand a faint light that stole tremulously upward from the horizon\r\nserved to indicate the east and the dawn of the coming day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nDISCOVER LAND.\r\n\r\nThe following are the names of those who escaped with me in the\r\nlongboat:\r\n\r\n  Marc Hislop, mate,\r\n  Thomas Lambourne, second mate,\r\n  Francis Probart, carpenter,\r\n  John Thomas Burnett, ship's cook,\r\n  Edward Carlton,\r\n  Henry Warren,\r\n  Hugh Chute,\r\n  Matthew Hipkin,\r\n  William Wilkins, usually called \"Boy Bill.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the morning light came in, there appeared to the south-westward a\r\nvast bank of mist or cloud which shrouded half the sky, and assumed a\r\nvariety of beautiful tints when the rising sun shone on it--yellow\r\nand saffron, deepening into purple and blue as its masses changed in\r\nthe contrary currents of air; while to the eastward, in the quarter\r\nof the sun's ascension, the rippling ocean shone as if covered with\r\ntremulous and glittering plates of mingled gold and green.\r\n\r\nA ration of rum-and-water in equal proportions was now served round\r\nto each man--the leathern cover of a bung being our only cup, as we\r\nhad omitted a drinking vessel among our hastily-collected stores.\r\nHalf of a biscuit given to each constituted our breakfast, and with\r\nhope dawning with the day in our hearts, we shipped our oars and\r\npulled stoutly toward the west.\r\n\r\nTom Lambourne steered: the sea was smooth, the wind light, and in our\r\nfavor; so ere long the mast was shipped, and a sail hoisted to lessen\r\nthe labor of the rowers.\r\n\r\nWe were anxious for the dense bank of purple cloud to clear away,\r\nthat we might have a more extensive view of the horizon, and perhaps\r\ndiscover a sail, but the envious vapor seemed to darken and to roll\r\nbefore us, or rather before the wind that bore us after it.\r\n\r\nAbout mid-day, when we were pausing on our oars, breathless and\r\npanting with heat, drenched with perspiration, which ran into our\r\neyes and trickled down our breasts; and when visions of iced water\r\nand bitter beer came tantalizingly to memory--for sea and sky were\r\nequally hot, as the former seemed to welter and become oily under the\r\nblaze of the latter--a sharp-winged bird that skimmed past us\r\nsuddenly caught the hollow eye of Hislop, who, I thought, was\r\nsleeping.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that bird, Tom,\" he exclaimed, half starting up from the\r\nstern-sheets; \"it is a man-of-war bird!\"\r\n\r\n\"What then, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"We must be near land,\" replied the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Land!\" reiterated every one in the boat, their voices expressing\r\njoy, surprise, or incredulity.\r\n\r\n\"Is it Brazil?\" asked Tattooed Tom, with amazement in his singular\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"I do not think so,\" said Hislop, passing a hand wearily and\r\nreflectively over his pale forehead.  \"Brazil--it is impossible, by\r\nthe last reckoning I made before that Spaniard wounded me.  But\r\nHeaven only knows where we may have drifted to since then!\"\r\n\r\n\"The wind and currents may have taken us many hundred miles from\r\nwhere the last observation was made,\" added Carlton.\r\n\r\n\"But I am convinced that we are near land--look at the sea-wrack that\r\npasses us now; and we must be out of the track of the Gulfweed,\"\r\ncontinued the mate with confidence.\r\n\r\n\"And may I never see the Nore again, if _that ain't land now_,\r\nlooming right a-head through the fog-bank!\" exclaimed Tom, starting\r\nup, and shading his eyes from the sun with both hands as he peered\r\nintently westward.\r\n\r\nAs the reader may imagine, we all gazed anxiously enough in the\r\ndirection indicated by the old seaman, and a swell of rapture rose in\r\nthe breasts of all when something in the form of a headland or bluff\r\ncould be distinctly seen right ahead, bearing due west, about seven\r\nmiles distant, standing out from the bank of vapor, or looming like a\r\ndarker shadow _within_ it.\r\n\r\nThis appearance never changed in outline, but remained stationary,\r\nand every moment became more defined and confirmed.\r\n\r\nExclamations of joy now broke from us, and we congratulated each\r\nother on making the land so soon and so unexpectedly, without\r\nenduring the miseries which so frequently fall to the lot of those\r\nwho are cast away, as we were, in an open boat at sea.\r\n\r\n\"But what land is it?\" was the general inquiry.\r\n\r\nAnother allowance of grog was served round; the oars were again\r\nshipped, we bent our backs and breasts sturdily to the task, and at\r\nevery stroke almost lifted the boat clean out of the shining water in\r\nour eagerness to reach this suddenly discovered shore.\r\n\r\nThis had such an effect upon Marc Hislop, that though weak and\r\nsinking as he had been, he begged that he might be allowed to steer\r\nthe boat a little way, while Tom Lambourne kept a bright look-out\r\nahead, to watch for any ripple or surf that might indicate the\r\nlocality of a treacherous coral reef, as such might prove dangerous\r\nto a large and heavily laden craft like ours.\r\n\r\nWith every stroke of the bending oars the land seemed to rise higher\r\nand more high.\r\n\r\nEre long we could make out its form clearly.  It was bold, rocky, and\r\nmountainous, and as the mist dispersed or rose upward into mid air,\r\nwe could see the dark brown of the bluff, and some trees of strange\r\naspect, with drooping foliage on its summit, were clearly defined, as\r\nthey stood between us and the blue sky beyond.\r\n\r\nWe soon made out distinctly that it was a large island.  The shore\r\nwas somewhat level to the north-east, and in the centre towered an\r\nalmost perpendicular mountain of vast height, the sides of which\r\nseemed covered with furze, gorse, and brushwood.\r\n\r\nElsewhere its dusky and copper-colored rocks started sheer out of the\r\nsea, whose waters formed a zone of snow-white surf around their base.\r\n\r\nWe headed the boat to the north-east, where the shore seemed more\r\napproachable, and as we pulled along it, but keeping fully three\r\nmiles off, when the land opened, we saw high crags, deep ravines,\r\nshady woods and dells in the interior, though no appearance of\r\nhouses, of wigwams, or of inhabitants.\r\n\r\nMany speculations were now ventured as to what island this might be.\r\n\r\n\"May it not be land that has never before been discovered?\" I\r\nsuggested with a glow of pleasure, in the anticipation of being among\r\nthe first to tread an unexplored and hitherto unknown shore.  Hislop\r\nsmiled and shook his head.\r\n\r\nHenry Warren, who had been an old South-sea whaler, suggested that it\r\nwas the island Grando, but Hislop assured us that this was\r\nimpossible.  In the first place, by the position of the sun, he could\r\nsee that we were not so far south as the parallel of Port San Giorgio\r\non the Brazilian shore; and in the second, the existence of such an\r\nisland was doubted.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be Trinidad Island--Tristan da Cunha, or the Rocks of Martin\r\nVaz?\" asked Tom Lambourne.\r\n\r\n\"If the latter,\" replied Hislop, \"we should now be in south latitude\r\n20° 27', but this land in no way answers to the aspect of the Martin\r\nVaz Rocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever see them, sir?\" asked several.\r\n\r\n\"No; but they are described by La Perouse as appearing like _five_\r\ndistinct headlands.\"  After pausing and pondering for a moment, he\r\nsuddenly added, with confidence, \"It is the Island of Alphonso de\r\nAlbuquerque!\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know?\" I inquired.\r\n\r\n\"By the appearance of that cliff, and the mountain inland.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been here before?\" asked Probart.\r\n\r\n\"Never; but I know it to be Alphonso by that cliff on the north, and\r\nthe mountain too, which were particularly described in a Spanish book\r\nI lost in the _Eugenie_.  The mountain is a peak which the author\r\nsays resembles--did any of you ever see a place like it before?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is as like Tenny Reef from the port of Santa Cruz, as one egg is\r\nlike another!\" exclaimed Tom Lambourne.\r\n\r\n\"Exactly, Tom, that is what the Spanish author likens it to, though\r\nhe does not use the simile.  So if it is the island of Alphonso, we\r\nare now somewhere in south latitude 37° 6', and west longitude 12°\r\n2'.  Pull southward, my lads, the shore opens a bit beyond that\r\nheadland.  We shall find a smooth beach probably within the bight\r\nyonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyway we're not in pilot's water,\" added Tom, laughing; \"give way,\r\nmates--stretch out.\"\r\n\r\nWe pulled with a hearty will, and ere long were close in shore--so\r\nclose that our larboard oars seemed almost to touch the rocks which\r\nrose sheer from the sea, like mighty cyclopean walls, but covered\r\nwith the greenest moss; they overhung and overshadowed the dark, deep\r\nwater that washed their base, and as they shielded us from the fierce\r\nnoonday heat of the sun, we found the partial coolness refreshing and\r\ndelightful.\r\n\r\nAs Hislop had foreseen, on rounding the bluff, the shore receded\r\ninward, and through a line of white surf, like that which boils over\r\nthe bar at a river's mouth, we dashed into a beautiful little bay,\r\nthe sandy beach of which was shaded by groves of bright green trees.\r\n\r\nStill we saw no trace of inhabitants; but selecting a small creek\r\nwhich was almost concealed by trees that grew, like mangroves, close\r\nto the edge of the water, we ran our boat in, moored her securely,\r\nwhere none were likely to find her save ourselves, and then all\r\nsprang joyously ashore--at least all save Hislop and Billy the cabin\r\nboy, who remained to attend him, while we went on an exploring\r\nexpedition in search of natives or whatever might turn up next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND OF ALPHONSO.\r\n\r\nWe had some dread of savages, and being totally unarmed, we\r\npenetrated inland with more anxiety than pleasure at first; but ere\r\nlong we became convinced that the island was totally destitute of\r\nhuman inhabitants.\r\n\r\nNo vestige of wigwam or hut, of road or path, nor even of the\r\nsmallest track or trail (save such as the wild goats made) was\r\nvisible anywhere, and thus we became impressed with new emotions of\r\nwonder and awe, in treading a soil where man lived not--where no\r\nhuman foot seemed to have trod, and where only the hum of insect life\r\nstirred the solitude of that wild island of the South Atlantic.\r\n\r\nFor a considerable distance we traversed flat ground that was covered\r\nwith sedge grass, interspersed by shrubs of bright green.  Beyond\r\nthis level plain rose a series of ridges covered by trees, and those\r\nridges formed the first slope of the great mountain, which was some\r\nthousand feet in height, and also of the great bluff we had first\r\ndescried at sea.\r\n\r\nWe found Alphonso to be the largest of a group of three islands.  It\r\nis a mass of rock nearly twelve miles in circumference.  The other\r\ntwo are cavernous and inaccessible, and every approach to them is\r\ndangerous and difficult, in consequence of the foaming of the sea\r\nabout them, so that during the weary days of our sojourn there, we\r\nmade no attempt to explore them, lest the longboat--in our\r\ncircumstances a priceless property--might be swamped or dashed to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nHislop informed me that he had read somewhere that in the month of\r\nMarch, 1506--the same year in which the great Columbus died--two\r\nadventurers of Spain or Portugal, named Tristan da Cunha and Alphonso\r\nde Albuquerque, sailed for the Indies on a voyage of discovery, with\r\nfourteen great caravels.\r\n\r\nDuring this expedition they found three great islands which they\r\nnamed after Tristan da Cunha, and elsewhere three others, which were\r\nnamed from Alphonso, who, after their fleet had been scattered by a\r\ngreat tempest, sailed through the Mozambique channel.  He discovered\r\nmany seas, isles, and channels hitherto unknown to the Portuguese or\r\nSpaniards, and ultimately reached the Indies, of which he became\r\nviceroy for Ferdinand the Catholic, and died in 1515, holding that\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nIt is very strange that since that remote period, no European country\r\nhas turned these islands to any account, as they do not lie more than\r\nfifty leagues from the general track of the shipping bound for the\r\ncoast of Coromandel or the Chinese seas, and in time of war would\r\nform a useful and important rendezvous for a fleet.\r\n\r\nThey lie exactly in that portion of the wide and mighty ocean where\r\nit was fabled and believed a great continent would yet be found.\r\n\r\nThe three isles of Tristan da Cunha, which lie some hundred miles\r\ndistant, have now a mixed some hundred miles distant, have now a\r\nmixed population of English, Portuguese, and mulattoes; and a strong\r\ngarrison was maintained there during the captivity of the Emperor\r\nNapoleon at St. Helena.\r\n\r\nBeing thus cast away upon a shore so far from the general track of\r\nships, we resolved to make preparations for a probable residence of\r\nsome time--to build a hut wherein to store our provisions, and to use\r\nevery means for adding to our stock, by angling in the creeks, which\r\nseemed to abound with fish, and by hunting in the woods, which teemed\r\nwith goats and boars running wild; by collecting birds' eggs, as the\r\ncliffs seemed to be literally alive with petrels, albatrosses, and\r\nsea-hens; and all these exertions were the more necessary as none\r\ncould foresee the probable length of our sojourn there.\r\n\r\nA ship might heave in sight to-morrow; but a year _might_ pass before\r\none came near enough to be attracted by our signs.\r\n\r\nWe resolved to have a signal-post erected on the mountain top, a\r\nbeacon-fire prepared, and amid these and many other deliberations,\r\nthe night closed in and found us tolerably contented with our island,\r\nand even disposed to be merry over misfortunes that we could not\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nBut considerable speculation was excited when Billy Wilkins the cabin\r\nboy, who had been in pursuit of a little kid along the beach,\r\nreturned to us, dragging after him a long spar which he had found\r\namong the layers of shingles, bright shells, and dusky weeds,\r\ndeposited by the sea; and on examination this spar proved to be one\r\nof the lower studding-sail booms of the _Eugenie_, and the same which\r\nhad parted from the brig and fallen overboard with Antonio on the\r\neventful evening of his punishment!\r\n\r\n\"It is our own property,\" said Billy, \"and may be useful when we have\r\na fire to light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Boy Bill, we have a better use for it than burning,\" said Tattooed\r\nTom; \"'tis the mast for our signal-post, already made to hand, and\r\nwe'll step it on the hill-top to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nFor that night we bivouacked under a large tree, the name and genus\r\nof which were alike unknown to us.  At times some were conversing,\r\nsome slept, others lay waking and thinking, with the murmur of the\r\nshining sea, close by, in their ears; and I could see the stars of\r\nthe Southern Cross shining with wonderful brilliance at the verge of\r\nthe watery horizon.\r\n\r\nThe novelty of our situation kept me long awake, and with my head\r\npillowed on a bundle of dry seaweed, with the sail of the longboat\r\nspread over us as an impromptu tent and for protection from the dew,\r\nI lay in meditation and full of melancholy thoughts ere sleep came\r\nupon me, and with it confused dreams of the burning ship, of my\r\nsecluded home, and of\r\n\r\n                \"----the schoolboy spot,\r\n  We long remember, though there long forgot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain I was at Eton!  Again I saw the smooth green playing-fields\r\nalive with ardent schoolboys in the merry summer sunshine; and again\r\nI heard the clamor of their young voices and the balls rattling on\r\nbat and wicket; again I heard the pleasant green leaves rustle in the\r\nold woods of the Tudor times; or again I was in the shady quadrangles\r\nwhere the monotonous hum of many classes poring over their studies\r\nstole through the mullioned windows on the ambient air; and in my\r\ndreaming ear that \"drowsy hum\" seemed strangely to mingle with the\r\nchafing of the surge upon \"th' unnumbered pebbles\" of the lonely\r\nshore close by.\r\n\r\nAt last overcome by weariness, by lassitude and toil, I slept soundly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nWE BUILD A HUT.\r\n\r\nMy old tutor at Eton used to say, quoting some \"wise saw,\" that \"a\r\nlazy boy made a lazy man, just as a crooked sapling makes a crooked\r\ntree.\"\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for me, however, while on the island of Alphonso,\r\nthat my habits were those of activity, and that I was never lymphatic\r\nby nature.\r\n\r\nAfter dawn next morning we set about the erection of a hut, though we\r\nhad no other tools than a small hatchet and our clasp-knives.  With\r\nthese we cut or tore down a great number of large branches, and stuck\r\nthem in the earth, selecting a place where two angles of impending\r\nrock conveniently enough formed two solid walls for our edifice,\r\nleaving us but two others to erect.\r\n\r\nAs Tom Lambourne said, \"the fellow who cannot use a hammer or axe, is\r\nonly _half a man_,\" so we all worked hard with such implements as we\r\nhad, until our hut was complete.\r\n\r\nWe left an entrance next the rocks by which to creep in and out, and\r\nthen thatched or built over the intertwisted branches with turf, torn\r\nup by our hands, and with broad plantain leaves, creepers, and all\r\nkinds of tendrils that had toughness and consistency woven to form a\r\nroof.\r\n\r\nAt the erection of this most primitive wigwam we toiled the whole\r\nday, save during the scorching interval of noon, and ere nightfall it\r\nwas complete, with piles of dried leaves and seagrass for couches and\r\nbedroom furniture.\r\n\r\nTherein we placed all our provisions--the three bags of bread, two\r\nkegs of rum (which by unanimous consent were placed under the sole\r\nsupervision of Hislop); our four casks of water were also brought\r\nashore, though there was no lack of pure springs on the island.\r\n\r\nIn this wigwam were also placed our blankets, the sails and tackle of\r\nthe longboat, and then the succeeding days were spent in accumulating\r\nprovisions (as we looked forward with dread to our last biscuit), and\r\na signal-post was erected on the mountain.\r\n\r\nWith Probart the carpenter, and Henry Warren (two of our stoutest\r\nhands), Tom Lambourne and I went upon this duty.\r\n\r\nAlternately carrying on our shoulders or dragging in our hands the\r\nstudding-sail boom, we toiled through wild and untrodden wastes,\r\ntoward the summit of the great and yet nameless conical mountain that\r\nrears its lonely scalp to the height of five thousand feet above the\r\nwaves of the Southern sea.\r\n\r\nThe hope that on reaching its summit we _might_ descry a sail, was an\r\nadditional incentive to toil up the steep slope without lingering by\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nOn leaving a flat savanna of sedge-grass we reached a series of\r\nwooded ridges which form the base of the mountain, at every step\r\nrousing clouds of birds, especially a species of blackcock, and twice\r\nin the jungle we came upon the lair of wild boars of great size and\r\nsuch ferocity of aspect that we were glad to shrink astern of\r\nTattooed Tom, who carried the hatchet.\r\n\r\nThis jungle was exceedingly difficult of penetration, owing to its\r\ndensity, the number of wild aloes, with creeping plants, prickly\r\npears, and other tropical weeds, of what kind I know not, twined\r\nabout them.  It was a literal wilderness of serrated grass blades,\r\nyellow gourds, and great squashy pumpkins like gigantic vegetable\r\nmarrows, all woven into an inextricable network of leaves, tendrils,\r\nand branches.\r\n\r\nIn other places we had to force a passage through thickets of richly\r\nflowered shrubs and tall plants with mighty leaves, the general\r\ngreenery of the landscape being increased by the many runnels of fine\r\nspring water which poured down the fissures of the mountain into the\r\nplain we had left.\r\n\r\nBy the sides of these runnels, we frequently paused, and making a cup\r\nof a large leaf, filled it with the cool, limpid water that gurgled\r\nover the rocks, to quench our constant thirst; and for a time such\r\nvegetable cups were the only drinking vessels we had while on the\r\nisland of Alphonso.\r\n\r\nAt last we gained the summit of the mountain, and with mingled\r\nsatisfaction and anxiety in our hearts, swept the horizon with eager\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nNot a sail was in sight!\r\n\r\nFar as our eyesight could reach around us, in a mighty circle, rolled\r\nthe waters of the Southern Atlantic, almost tepid with heat, and pale\r\nand white, as they seemed to palpitate under the rays of the\r\nunclouded sun.\r\n\r\nAt our feet lay the whole isle of Alphonso and its two rocky\r\nappendages, with the encircling sea boiling in the narrow chasms\r\nbetween them, with a fury which was the result of contrary currents,\r\nand which formed a singular contrast to its calmness elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief rest we prepared to set up the signal-post.\r\n\r\nTom took off his shirt, and drawing from his pocket a piece of\r\nspunyarn, which a seaman is seldom without, he lashed his\r\nunder-garment to the end of the studding-sail boom, and by the aid of\r\nthe hatchet and our hands, we scraped a hole sufficiently deep in\r\nwhich to erect the spar, and then jammed it hard and fast with\r\nstones.  As the shirt was blown out flag fashion upon the wind, we\r\nhoped it would prove a sufficient indication to a vessel approaching\r\nfrom any quarter that there were people on the island in want of\r\nsuccor.\r\n\r\nFor some hours we lingered on the mountain-top, in the fond hope of\r\nseeing a sail, and then returned slowly downward to the beach, where\r\nour shipmates awaited us at the wigwam which now formed our home, and\r\nwhich we jocularly designated the capital city of Alphonso.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nA WILD BOAR.\r\n\r\nWe felt very much the want of firearms.  The air seemed alive with\r\nbirds--the woods with game of several kinds; and now an old musket\r\nwith a few charges of powder would have proved more useful to us than\r\nthe treasure of the Bank of England.\r\n\r\nHislop recovered strength rapidly, and his convalescence inspired our\r\nlittle band of castaways with new confidence and vigor, as they had\r\nimplicit reliance in his superior knowledge and intelligence.\r\n\r\nWe were never idle; for, unarmed as we were, the task of procuring\r\nfood for our general store was by no means a sinecure to those who\r\nundertook it.\r\n\r\nTom Lambourne and John Burnet, the cook, first brought us a valuable\r\ncontribution in the shape of a great sea-lion, which was furnished\r\nwith a rough and shaggy mane, that added greatly to its terrible\r\naspect, for it was an unwieldy brute, as large as a small-sized cow.\r\n\r\nThey had fallen in with it when it lay basking on the beach.  Burnet\r\ncourageously attacked it with one of the stretchers of the\r\nlong-boat,* and dealt it a severe stroke on the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Stretchers are pieces of wood placed across the bottom of a boat,\r\nwhereon the oarsmen place their feet that they may have additional\r\npurchase in rowing.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe animal uttered a hoarse grunt and turned upon him open-mouthed,\r\nwhen he thrust the staff down its throat, and held it there till\r\nLambourne hewed off the head with his hatchet.\r\n\r\nOne or two others were afterwards despatched in the same way; but we\r\nhad to lie long in wait, and could catch them only by cutting off\r\ntheir retreat to the water.\r\n\r\nTheir hearts and tongues were considered the best food by the\r\nsailors, who broiled them over a fire which we kindled by striking\r\ntwo stones together, and letting the sparks fall upon a heap of dry\r\nleaves; and to the discovery of these _impromptu_ flints we were\r\nindebted to Ned Carlton.\r\n\r\nAs for salt, I found plenty of it, baked in the crevices of the rocks\r\nupon the beach, where the spray had dried it in the hot sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe wild boars that lurked in the woods, baffled our efforts for a\r\nlong time.  By the edge of the hatchet we possessed, I fashioned for\r\nmy own use a kind of spear, about six feet long, hewn out of a piece\r\nof fine teak wood, which I found upon the beach.\r\n\r\nThis weapon I made and pointed with great care, and armed with it\r\nfrequently lay in watch for the sea-lions, but without success.\r\n\r\nOn the shore, at this season, when the sunshine was reflected from\r\nthe sloping faces of the volcanic rocks and from the surface of the\r\nsea, the heat was beyond all description--intense, breathless, and\r\nsuffocating, so that the lungs would collapse painfully, in the\r\ndifficulty of respiration.\r\n\r\nTo breathe was like attempting it at the mouth of a newly opened\r\nfurnace, and so I usually retired inland and sought the cool solitude\r\nof the deep thickets, or wandered through groves of solemn,\r\nimpressive, and majestic old trees; for some were there so old, that\r\nthey must have cast the shadows of their foliage on Alphonso de\r\nAlbuquerque, or Tristan de Cunha, and their bearded followers.\r\n\r\nHow many ocean storms had swept their leaves into the waste of waters\r\nsince then!\r\n\r\nWe had now been five days on the island without a sail being seen,\r\nthough more than half our time was spent in watching the horizon; and\r\nso Tom Lambourne's old shirt still waved in vain from the boom-end on\r\nthe mountain-top.\r\n\r\nOn the fifth day, however, to our surprise, the signal was no longer\r\nvisible, so we supposed that a gust of wind had overthrown it in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nLambourne, Carlton, and Probart started for the mountain-top to\r\nrestore it, while Hislop and I rambled into the woods, where we had a\r\nview of the shining sea to the westward.  The waves came in long\r\nrollers, as there was a fresh breeze blowing from the west, and the\r\nfoam rose white and high on the tremendous bluffs of the Inaccessible\r\nIsles, as we named them.\r\n\r\nAll the water between them was a sheet of sparkling and snowy froth,\r\namid which, had we been nearer, we should doubtless have seen the\r\nblack heads of the sea lions, as they sported in the spray and\r\nsunshine.\r\n\r\nOn asking Hislop how far he thought we were from the continents of\r\nAfrica and South America, he replied without hesitation,--\r\n\r\n\"We are about fifteen hundred miles from the mouth of the Rio de la\r\nPlata on the westward, and twelve hundred odd from the Cape of Good\r\nHope on the east; but there is land nearer to us----\"\r\n\r\n\"Land nearer!\" I reiterated.\r\n\r\n\"There are the three isles of Tristan da Cunha, and about five\r\nhundred miles south-west of us a desolate rock called the Isle of\r\nDiego Alvarez; and fortunate it is indeed for us that we were not\r\ncast away _there_, as it yields only mossy grass, and now and then a\r\nfew seals or sea-elephants may be seen upon the reefs about it.  But,\r\nDick Rodney, does it not make one long to be afloat again, with a\r\ngood ship underfoot, both tacks and the breeze too, aft?--a cloud of\r\ncanvas, carrying the three masts into one when seen astern--the lower\r\nstudding-sail booms rigged out and dipping in the flying spray as she\r\nrolls from side to side--does it not, I say, bring all this to mind,\r\nwhen from here we can watch the waves that rose, perhaps, upon the\r\nshores of Mexico rolling in foam between these rocky isles?  Do you\r\nremember Homer's description of the curling wave?\"  And without\r\nwaiting my reply he began to recite from the _Iliad_, with wonderful\r\nfacility:\r\n\r\n  \"As on the hoarse resounding shore, when blows the stormy west,\r\n  The billowy tide comes surging wide, from ocean's dark blue breast;\r\n  First in mid-sea 'tis born, then swells and rages more and more,\r\n  And rolling on with snowy back, comes thundering near the shore;\r\n  Then rears its crest, firm and sublime, and with tumultuous bray\r\n  Smites the grim front of the rugged rock, and _spits_ the briny spray.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHow far Hislop in his classical enthusiasm might have pursued his\r\nfree translation, till we had all the deeds of Agamemnon and others\r\non that tremendous day before the walls of Troy, I cannot say, had\r\nnot a crashing sound in the adjacent thicket roused and alarmed us.\r\n\r\nWe started up, and had just time to conceal ourselves behind the\r\ntrunk of a tree, when a herd of seven wild boars came plunging out of\r\nthe thicket to drink at a runnel which flowed toward the sea.\r\n\r\nThey were unlike any of the swinish race we had ever seen before; and\r\nbut for our vague sensations of alarm we could have watched them with\r\npleasure, as they inserted their long fierce snouts in the water that\r\nsparkled under the forest leaves.\r\n\r\nThey were all broad-shouldered animals, with high crests and thick\r\nbristly manes; and all were black in color or darkly brindled.\r\n\r\nUnlike those of the sty-fed hogs to which we had been accustomed at\r\nhome, their erected bristles shone like silver or polished steel in\r\nthe rays of sunshine that fell through the waving branches; their\r\neyes were flashing and clear, and their skins were all clean as if\r\nwashed for a show of prize pigs.\r\n\r\nThin flanked, active, and strong, they began to grunt and gambol, and\r\nto splash up the glittering water, till suddenly they caught sight of\r\nus, and all fled save one, a fierce old boar, which, after tearing up\r\nthe grass with his hind feet, came resolutely forward, showing a pair\r\nof tusks that made me tremble for the calves of my legs if I ventured\r\nto run off, and still more for those of poor Hislop, who was alike\r\nunable to escape or confront him.\r\n\r\nFortunately I had my teak-wood spear.\r\n\r\nWhile keeping a tree between me and the boar, he prepared for the\r\noffensive by whetting his terrible tusks against a stone and grunting\r\nhoarsely.\r\n\r\nExcited and bewildered, as he came on at a quick run, I charged my\r\nweapon full at him, and by the mercy of Providence, the point entered\r\none of his fierce glittering eyes, which made him rear and recoil,\r\nwhile in his rage and pain the bristles on his ridgy back rose up\r\nlike little blades of steel.\r\n\r\n\"Into his throat with your spear!\" cried Hislop; but I anticipated\r\nthe suggestion, for ere the words had left his lips, I had\r\nburied--thrusting deep with all the force that excitement and terror\r\ngave me--the pointed teak-wood shaft down his red and gaping throat.\r\n\r\nChoking in blood, in foam and fury, the great boar writhed upon his\r\nback, and in doing so twitched from my hands the weapon, which still\r\nremained wedged in his throat and tongue, and rendered him almost\r\npowerless.  I knew not what to do now, for if he snapped it through,\r\nand thus released himself, we, or I at least, would be lost.\r\n\r\nBut as he lay there on his back and sides alternately, snorting,\r\nroaring, and covering the grass with bloody froth, and tearing it by\r\nhis bristles, Hislop sprang forward, and though weak with many\r\nhalf-healed wounds, drove a clasp-knife repeatedly into the throat\r\nand stomach of the monster, which soon lay still enough.\r\n\r\nWhen it was quite dead, I drew out my teakwood spear, and found the\r\npoint almost uninjured, for I had hardened it in fire.\r\n\r\nWe thrust two crooked branches through the tendons of the boar's\r\nhind-legs, and by these drew it to our hut, which was about half a\r\nmile distant; there our prize caused great congratulation among our\r\ncrew, and I obtained no little praise for performing so hardy a feat.\r\n\r\nOur return diverted for a time some excitement and surprise which had\r\nbeen caused by the return of Tom Lambourne, Probart, and Carlton from\r\nthe mountain-top, with tidings that the studding-sail boom had\r\nvanished, and that not a trace of it was to be found anywhere!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nA NEW PERPLEXITY.\r\n\r\nThe disappearance of the boom and of Tom's old striped shirt, which\r\nhad waved from it like a banner, excited considerable speculation and\r\nsomething of alarm.\r\n\r\nIf simply overturned by the wind, it must have lain where it fell; at\r\nall events, it could not have rolled far from the cairn, or pile of\r\nstones, in the centre of which we had wedged it.  By what agency had\r\nthis disappearance come to pass?\r\n\r\nThat it was the work of wild animals could not for a moment be\r\nconceived; so the event filled us with vague but very alarming\r\nconjectures.\r\n\r\nWith his hatchet, Probart the carpenter cut down and prepared a long\r\nand slender tree to replace the lost boom on the top of the Devil's\r\nMountain, as we now termed it; and while one portion of us assisted\r\nhim in this, the other set about the capture of some of the wild\r\ngoats with which the woods of the island abounded, as we were anxious\r\nto procure the milk of the females, and the flesh of their kids.\r\n\r\nThis was a most arduous task, as they were so fleet of foot; and when\r\npursued, or when in search of those bitter and astringent plants of\r\nwhich they are so fond, they could gain the most dangerous pinnacles\r\nand ledges of rock that overhung the sea.  In such places there grew\r\na kind of wild laburnum, and Hislop did not fail to remind me that\r\nTheocritus described it as the favorite food of the goat.\r\n\r\nWe often saw these agile quadrupeds spring, without pause, fear, or\r\nhesitation, from pinnacle to pinnacle, or from ledge to ledge of\r\nrock, where, had they missed footing, they must have fallen a\r\nthousand feet or more, either into the ocean on one side, or some\r\nravine on the other; and there, perched far aloft, they would remain,\r\nlooking at us quietly, and reminding me of the couplet:\r\n\r\n  \"High hung in air the hoary goat reclined,\r\n  His streaming beard the sport of every wind.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBy great industry, and the exertion of incredible labor and activity,\r\nwe succeeded in capturing five, by isolating them from their flocks\r\nand chasing them into chasms and corners from which they had no means\r\nof escape, and then we secured them by the running rigging of the\r\nlongboat.\r\n\r\nSome of the females afforded milk, a rarity and nourishment to us who\r\nhad been so long at sea.  The flesh of a kid we thought delicious;\r\nand lest we should tire of roasted and broiled, Jack Burnet, the\r\nship's cook, contrived to boil some pieces of a goat in its own skin,\r\nstretched upon sticks, with a fire underneath, salt for a spice, and\r\nsliced pumpkin for vegetables.\r\n\r\nOf the horns, when carefully scraped and cleaned, we made very\r\nefficient drinking-cups, in which our rum, duly mixed with water, was\r\ndoled out to us by Hislop, the keeper of our provision-store.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the sea-birds were a constant object of search, and being\r\nan expert climber, I frequently collected great numbers of those laid\r\nin the crevices of the rocks by the sea-gull and storm-finch.\r\n\r\nOur life was one of perpetual exposure and daily activity.  Though\r\noverpoweringly hot at noon, the atmosphere of the morning and evening\r\nwas delightful; and as these portions of the day were spent in\r\nhunting for food, the time passed rapidly; but Hislop's chief fear\r\nwas, that if we were not taken off by some ship before the rainy\r\nseason set in, our discomforts and danger from agues would become\r\nvery great.\r\n\r\nBy the time we had been fourteen days on the island, he was recovered\r\nso far as to be able to join me in making an exploration of it, or\r\nrather in walking all round it.\r\n\r\nThe circumference of the largest isle is only four leagues; but its\r\nshores are so steep and rocky in some places, that traversing them\r\nproved a most arduous task.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side we found a great cascade pouring from a brow of\r\nrock upon the beach.  The latter was covered almost everywhere by a\r\nbroad-leaved seaweed, the dark and slimy tendrils of which were\r\nseveral yards in length, and were termed by Hislop \"the gigantic\r\nfucus.\"\r\n\r\nSo day after day passed, and amid our various means of procuring\r\nfood, we never failed to keep a keen look-out to seaward for a\r\npassing sail; but none came near that lonely islet of the southern\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nOne morning I found there had drifted ashore near our hut a mass of\r\nthat mysterious substance, the origin of which has puzzled so many\r\nnaturalists--ambergris.  It must have weighed more than a hundred\r\npounds in weight; and and when we threw some of it into the fire, it\r\nmelted and diffused around a most agreeable perfume.  This marine\r\nproduction, which is only to be found in the seas or on the shores of\r\nAfrica and Brazil, is alleged by some to be a concretion formed in\r\nthe stomach of the spermaceti whale.\r\n\r\nOn the fifteenth morning after our landing, a seaman named Henry\r\nWarren, who went to milk our goats, which had been tethered to a\r\nlarge tree near the hut, returned in haste to announce that the ropes\r\nwhich had secured them were cut, apparently by a sharp\r\ninstrument--cut clean through--and that the goats, the capture of\r\nwhich had cost us so much labor, were gone.\r\n\r\n\"Cut?  By whom?\" asked every one.\r\n\r\nBefore we had time to consider this, Hislop came out of the hut, and\r\nstated that one of our three bread bags had also been cut open, by a\r\nslash from a knife apparently, and that several pounds of biscuit had\r\nbeen abstracted.\r\n\r\nThe strange alarm, and what was worse, the doubt of each other, which\r\nthese discoveries excited, were painful and bewildering.\r\n\r\nWe examined the place where the goats had been tethered, but could\r\ndiscover no traces of feet, and nothing remained but the ends of the\r\nropes (the longboat sheets and halliards) tied to the stem of a tree.\r\n\r\nWhoever among us had done this was guilty of wanton malice and\r\ntreason to the rest of his friends--for friends we hoped we were, as\r\nwell as brothers in misfortune.\r\n\r\nWe also examined the mutilated bread bag.  In the side thereof was a\r\nclean slash a foot in length, made by some sharp instrument, and by\r\nthis aperture the biscuits had been abstracted by some one who had\r\ninserted his hands through the fragile wall of our hut, which, as I\r\nhave stated, was composed only of turf and branches.\r\n\r\nThis theft had been committed in the night; but by whom?\r\n\r\nWas the thief one of ourselves?  The eyes of each seemed to ask the\r\nhateful question of the others, and to repel their inquiring glances;\r\nbut soon after three of our missing biscuits were discovered by Tom\r\nLambourne, lying a few yards apart among the long grass, as if the\r\nabstractor had dropped them during a hasty flight toward the woods or\r\nthe Devil's Mountain.\r\n\r\n\"In addition to ourselves there is some one else on this island,\"\r\nexclaimed Hislop, emphatically; \"and this accounts for the loss of\r\nthe studding-sail boom; and without delay, this some one else must be\r\ndiscovered.\"\r\n\r\nWe dreaded lest savages might be concealed in some of the caverns or\r\nwoods, and that they might come upon us in the night and slay all, or\r\nthat they might make off with or destroy the longboat, our most\r\nvaluable possession.\r\n\r\nIt was at once resolved that one of our number (to be regularly\r\nrelieved) should remain in it day and night, armed with the hatchet,\r\nour only weapon, and that he should be well flogged if he slept, or\r\nneglected the double duty of watching the hut and boat, which were\r\nclose by each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY INCREASES.\r\n\r\nAn immediate search was resolved upon.  Lots were cast for the one\r\nwho was to remain behind to guard our property, and the duty fell\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\nArmed with the boat stretchers, or with clubs which they had\r\ncarefully selected and cut from the trees, Hislop departed with all\r\nmy companions; and after proceeding over the grassy plain, they soon\r\ndisappeared in the woods that covered all the lower slope of the\r\ngreat mountain.\r\n\r\nI cannot describe the sensations of loneliness that came over me on\r\nfinding myself for the first time single, alone, and left entirely to\r\nmy own reflections and resources.\r\n\r\nThe carpenter's hatchet was my only weapon; and armed with it I sat\r\non a grassy slope mid-way between the hut and sea, gazing anxiously\r\ninland, listening for any passing sound; but all remained still save\r\nthe chafing of the waves on one hand, and the loud buzz of tropical\r\ninsect life in the thickets or among the long grass on the other.\r\n\r\nWhat, I asked myself, if savages were actually lurking in the woods,\r\nand on seeing that all my companions were gone, they should come\r\ntumultuously down upon the hut and boat?  I would at once become\r\ntheir victim.\r\n\r\nOr what would be my fate if my friends fell into an ambush, or\r\nperished in detail?\r\n\r\nCould any human beings be lurking in the two adjacent isles? was my\r\nnext surmise.\r\n\r\nWe had never seen any thing alive on them--not even wild goats or\r\nboars; and if there were other inhabitants, the steepness of the\r\nrocks, which rose sheer from the water, and the fury of the surf that\r\nrolled between, forbade any attempt to cross.\r\n\r\nSo in such painful surmises, and in keen watching, I passed the most\r\nof the day alone.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, one by one, all my shipmates returned to our little\r\nheadquarters on the shore, weary and jaded--torn by briars and\r\nbrambles in the thickets--and all had the same tale to tell.  They\r\nhad seen and heard of nothing save wild boars, wild goats, and\r\nsea-birds.\r\n\r\nHislop now directed that one of our number should guard the hut by\r\nnight, and a second the boat, with orders to hail each other in this\r\nfashion:\r\n\r\n\"Boat, ahoy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hut, ahoy!\"\r\n\r\nThis was to insure a watchful look-out; but with all these\r\nprecautions, wise and necessary though they were, our feeling of\r\nsecurity, and even of reliance on each other, was gone for the time.\r\n\r\nAs these occurrences excited the imagination of our companions, some\r\nof those who watched the hut and boat by night, asserted that when\r\nall our party, save themselves, were safely lodged and asleep,\r\nsomething like the figure of a very tall man had appeared for an\r\ninstant on the bluffs that overhung the sea, between them and the\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\nBut of this mysterious personage, if such existed anywhere, except in\r\nthe overstrained imagination of a lonely midnight watcher, we could\r\ndiscover no trace during day.\r\n\r\nOne night, when Francis Probart and Ned Carlton were on watch, a\r\nsound like the distant report of a pistol was heard by them, and at\r\nthe same instant, both saw a flock of petrels and storm-finches rise\r\nup in the moonlight from the face of a bluff, where they revolved\r\nabove the breakers, like a swarm of gnats in a sunbeam.\r\n\r\nSo if Ned and the carpenter were mistaken in the sound, the birds\r\nwere also roused and alarmed.\r\n\r\nMarc Hislop ridiculed their story, but he was considerably\r\nbewildered, and so were we all when two days after, a seaman named\r\nHugh Chute, when rambling in the woods, found one of our goats, which\r\nwe knew by the fragment of rope still tied round its neck, lying\r\ndead, with a _bullet_ in its throat!\r\n\r\nHe brought it to the hut, where the wound was cut open, and the\r\nbullet extracted.  It was small, and had evidently been fired from a\r\npistol; this event caused the most exciting speculations, amid which\r\nthe carcass was hastily buried, as not one of us would eat of it.\r\n\r\nWhat or who could this person be? were the prevailing questions; and\r\nwhat was his reason for concealing himself from us in the thick woods\r\nof the island?\r\n\r\nIn the thorough exploration of the latter, caused by these episodes,\r\nour people fortunately discovered a fine grove of banana trees, and\r\nreturned laden with their yellow and luscious fruit.\r\n\r\nAt the same time Tattooed Tom found some letters \"in a foreign\r\nlingo,\" as he said, cut on the face of a steep rock, overhanging the\r\nriver, which formed the cascade at the beach.  To this rock he\r\nconducted Hislop and me next day, and after tearing aside some masses\r\nof creepers and scraping off a rich coating of moss, we found this\r\nold legend on the smoothed face of the basalt:\r\n\r\n  EL NOBLE CABALLERO, D. ALPHONSO DE ALBUQUERQUE;\r\n  A. D. 1506.\r\n  RVGVEN A DIOS FOR EL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The year of the discovery of the island!\" said Hislop.\r\n\r\n\"Have other eyes ever seen this inscription since?\" added I.\r\n\r\n\"It is very doubtful.  This Alphonso also discovered the Albuquerque\r\nKays, as he named the three islets which lie off the Mosquito shore\r\nin the Caribbean Sea.\"\r\n\r\nHislop copied the inscription into his notebook, and just as we\r\nturned to leave the spot, a large stone about sixty pounds in weight,\r\ncame crashing down the cliff, hurled apparently from its summit, and\r\nif so, by no inexpert hand, for it struck the rock of the legend\r\nwithin a foot of where Hislop stood, and was shivered into a hundred\r\npieces, covering him over with dust.\r\n\r\nHad it struck him instead, he had been slain and mangled on the spot.\r\nHad a fragment broken any of his limbs, in how miserable a plight\r\nwould he have been on that desolate island, without proper shelter or\r\nsurgical aid!\r\n\r\nLooking up to the summit of the cliff, which was about a hundred and\r\nfifty feet in height, I perceived among the dense fringe of wild\r\ngourds, shrubs, leaves, and plantain trees, then waving in the wind,\r\nsomething like a human face, that, after peering over at us, was\r\nsuddenly withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\"That stone was never dislodged either by goats or by accident,\" said\r\nHislop; \"there is not a vestige of clay upon the fragments--besides,\r\nall the face of the cliff is smooth and solid rock!\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is the only place we did not overhaul yesterday, master\r\nHislop,\" said Tom Lambourne.\r\n\r\n\"Then _there_ must be the thief of our biscuits--of our goats----\"\r\n\r\n\"Of our stun'sail boom and my old guernsey.  Let us have all hands\r\nturned up for a hunt again,\" exclaimed Tom.\r\n\r\nI now mentioned what I had seen.\r\n\r\n\"A man!--do you think it was a man's head?\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot be certain, Hislop,\" said I; \"it seemed a face of some\r\nkind, and a very hairy one too.\"\r\n\r\n\"It might be an old pumpkin,\" suggested Tom, in his matter-of-fact\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\"Or a goat--at all events, it could not have been a baboon?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No, no; there is no such animal hereabout, master Rodney,\" replied\r\nTom.\r\n\r\n\"Man or monkey, goat or devil, we'll overhaul the place this very\r\nafternoon.\"  exclaimed Hislop, with increasing energy and anger; \"but\r\nfirst we shall return with all expedition to the hut.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nTHE MYSTERY SOLVED.\r\n\r\nAll day the air had been unusually sultry and breathlessly hot, even\r\nfor the tropics at that season; but when the sun sank westward, when\r\nthe air became cooler, and the shadows of the island, with its wooded\r\nbluff and towering blue mountain, across the slope of which the light\r\ngossamer clouds lay floating half-way up, were thrown far eastward\r\nover that lonely sea which no keel seemed ever to furrow, we prepared\r\nfor a further exploration, or as Hugh Chute said, \"to overhaul that\r\nere cliff from truck to keelson.\"\r\n\r\nChute and Carlton were despatched to its base, by the way of the\r\nriver bank, and to where the cascade poured over the rocks, waking\r\nthe solemn echoes of the otherwise silent ravine.\r\n\r\nTheir instructions were, to station themselves near the rock which\r\nbore the Spanish legend--to keep a sharp look-out on the face of the\r\ncliff and all the way up to the grove of banana trees that grew on\r\nits summit.\r\n\r\nBilly the cabin boy was left in charge of the hut and boat, while\r\nHislop, with the rest of us advanced toward the cliff, up the sloping\r\nbank of which--its only accessible point--we proceeded to climb.\r\n\r\nIt was, or is (twelve months can make no change) a hundred and fifty\r\nfeet in height, as I have stated, rising sharply up from the side of\r\nthe great mountain, and is covered by a jungle of wild shrubs that\r\nmust have been growing there since the days of the deluge.\r\n\r\nThe creepers with gummy branches, the sharp serrated grass, the\r\nyellow gourd vines, the wild tendrils and plants of which we knew\r\nneither the names nor the nature, were there interwoven as closely as\r\na herring net, to the depth of seven or eight feet from their roots.\r\n\r\nAmid this jungle the hum of the myriads of great insects which we\r\nroused and dislodged was deafening; while the black clouds of\r\ngadflies and cockroaches were very bewildering, and, to say the\r\nleast, annoying.\r\n\r\nWe floundered and fell as we waded through this sea of leaves and\r\nverdure, but rose and scrambled on again, pausing ever and anon,\r\nbreathless and exhausted, to sit and fan ourselves, or to aid in\r\npulling each other out of this jungly network, for it resembled that\r\nwhich sprang by magic spell around the palace of the sleeping beauty\r\nin the old fairy tale, to baffle all intruders for a hundred years.\r\n\r\nHislop, who had not yet recovered his strength, was among the first\r\nto give in, and declare, when half way up, that \"he could climb no\r\nfurther!\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three took advantage of this admission to remain with him for\r\na time; but I, refreshed by a ripe banana which had fallen from the\r\ntrees at the top, and which I found just at hand, pushed on, and\r\nbeing lighter than any of my companions, got ahead of them all.\r\n\r\nAfter half an hour's severe toil, during which my hands and knees\r\nwere lacerated and torn by sharp blades of gigantic grass, and by the\r\ngummy creepers to which one's very flesh adhered at times, I reached\r\nat last the banana trees, the foliage of which waved like a gigantic\r\nplume on the summit of this isolated rock.\r\n\r\nThe banana rises with a stem which is about six or seven inches in\r\ndiameter at the root, and from thence tapers upward to the height of\r\neighteen or twenty feet, to where the leaves spring like a bright\r\ngreen tuft, broad, wavy, feathery, and drooping, as those of the palm\r\ndo.\r\n\r\nI uttered a shout--an \"_Io pœan!_\"--to my companions, announcing\r\nthat I had gained the summit before them, and armed with my only\r\nweapon, the teak-wood spear, pushed my way forward between the smooth\r\nstems of the bananas, till I reached the abrupt brow of the cliff,\r\nfrom the verge of which I saw, far down below, the bright blue stream\r\nthat rose on the slopes of the great mountain, running through the\r\nheart of the isle and glittering in the setting sun among groves and\r\nravines, to where it poured in foam upon the white sandy beach, and\r\nmingled with the mighty Southern Sea.\r\n\r\nI saw also the figures of Chute and Carlton, as they stood near the\r\nrock which bore the inscription, but they could neither distinguish\r\nme nor hear my shout, which gave fresh ardor to those whom I had left\r\nhalf-way down, and who now resumed their ascent.\r\n\r\nI looked keenly and cautiously about me on every side, but saw only\r\nthe slender and countless stems of the tall bananas, whose broad\r\nleaves, as they spread under or over each other, interrupted the rays\r\nof the sun, and formed a shade that was pleasing and gloomy.\r\n\r\nNow, when about to cross what seemed a hole or hollow in the jungle,\r\nby stepping from the strong tendril of one creeper to another, a\r\nnaked arm and great human hand came up from amid the mass of leaves!\r\n\r\nI was seized by the right foot, and in an instant found myself\r\ndragged down through foliage and intertwisted plants--down--down--I\r\nknew not where; and before I had time or breath to cry or resist, I\r\nlay prostrate on my back in a hole--a lair _under_ the matted\r\njungle--with a man above me, his knees planted on my breast, his\r\nstrong hands upon my bare throat, and his fierce wild eyes glaring\r\nlike those of a hyæna into mine.\r\n\r\nThen, how terrible were my emotions on recognizing in the light that\r\nfell through the mass of foliage above, as through a vine-covered\r\ntrellis--now overspread with hair, as beard and whiskers all were\r\nmatted into a mass--the dark and ferocious face of Antonio, whom I\r\nbelieved to be drowned and lying at the bottom of the sea--Antonio el\r\nCubano!\r\n\r\n\"Silenzio!\" said he, in a low voice, like the hiss of a serpent in my\r\near; but the injunction was unnecessary, for so completely was I\r\ntaken by surprise--so utterly at his mercy, and so destitute alike of\r\nbreath or weapon--that resistance was impossible.\r\n\r\nPerceiving that I was almost strangled he relaxed his fierce grasp a\r\nlittle, but still kept the sharply pricking point of his knife at my\r\nthroat, as a hint to remain quiet.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible for me to describe the emotions of my soul\r\nduring this time, which seemed an eternity to me!  Utter fear was\r\none, for I thought the fellow had something supernatural--something\r\ntruly of the _demon_--about him; that he could neither be drowned nor\r\ndestroyed; and I lay still in that dark hollow, panting in his fierce\r\nclutch without a thought of resistance.\r\n\r\nNow I heard my name shouted repeatedly.\r\n\r\n\"Rodney--Mr. Rodney--Dick Rodney--where are you?\"\r\n\r\nIt was Tom Lambourne and others, my companions, who had now attained\r\nthe summit of the rock, and were scrambling over the jungle, and\r\npushing between the stems of the bananas, searching for me, rather\r\nthan for the first object of such mystery.\r\n\r\nMy disappearance alarmed them.\r\n\r\n\"Can he have gone adrift over the bluff,\" I heard Tom Lambourne say,\r\n\"or is he only having a game with us by hiding himself?'\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes!--that is it,\" replied Probart, the carpenter; \"he can't have\r\ngone aloft into one of these bananas, for they are as clear of\r\nbranches as a spare topmast; so let us sheer off to the mate, and Mr.\r\nRodney will soon come down after us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, my lads, there are neither wild men nor wild beasts here,\"\r\nsaid Lambourne; \"so we shall return back to Master Hislop, who is\r\nhanging in the wind halfway down, and then be off to the hut.  We've\r\nearned a stiff glass of grog by this bout, anyhow.\"\r\n\r\nMy emotions became almost suffocating, when I heard them turn away to\r\ndescend and rejoin Hislop without me.\r\n\r\nI saw and heard them pass and repass over us, the creepers of the\r\njungle yielding with their weight.\r\n\r\nThe leg and foot of one, named Henry Warren, came down through the\r\ngreen network of leaves, and actually touched me.\r\n\r\nI drew a long gasping breath, and the atrocious Cubano, believing I\r\nwas about to cry aloud, compressed my throat so tightly with his\r\nmuscular hands, that a thousand lights seemed to flash before my\r\neyes, and I must have become senseless for some minutes, as the next\r\nincident that dwells in my memory, is seeing him sitting in a\r\ncrouching attitude, with his elbows on his knees; his black-bearded\r\nchin resting in the hollow of his right hand, and with his knife--his\r\nmurderous Albacete _cuchillo_--clenched in his white teeth, while he\r\nsurveyed me with a strange and sardonic smile in his deeply-set black\r\neyes, which glittered like those of a snake in the rays of sunlight\r\nthat struggled through the woven roof of leaves above us.\r\n\r\nI heard no more the voices of my shipmates.  They were gone, and I\r\nwas left alone and unarmed with this man or devil,--as yet I knew not\r\nwhich he was; but I knew that if he had the will, he had assuredly\r\nthe power, to kill and leave me in his lair, or to cast me, a mangled\r\nheap, to the bottom of the cliff whereon he lurked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nA TERRIBLE INTERVIEW.\r\n\r\nHe perceived the fear or horror he excited, and it seemed to amuse or\r\nflatter him.\r\n\r\nI remembered his dreams, his outcries, and midnight terrors, when in\r\nthe forecastle bunks; I thought of poor Captain Weston, of old\r\nRoberts the man-o'-war's man, who disappeared so mysteriously in the\r\nnight, and of others whose blood was upon this man's hands and on his\r\nsoul, and my flesh crept with loathing at our proximity.\r\n\r\nWhat must his thoughts have been amid the awful solitude of that\r\nlonely isle before our arrival?  I dared not attempt to imagine or to\r\nanalyze them.\r\n\r\nWhy were the waves so sparing--why was Fate so favorable to a wretch\r\nlike this?  How came it to pass that a life so vile had been so\r\nmarvellously protected? and when would the day of retribution come?\r\n\r\nAll these thoughts came upon me with rapidity.  Antonio seemed almost\r\nto read my heart, for he laughed, and said in Spanish,--\r\n\r\n\"El diabolo! so we meet again.  Ha! ha!  I suppose you thought--_Oho\r\nJuan bobo_--it was all over with the Cubano when the studding-sail\r\nboom parted, and amid the laughter of these English dogs I fell away\r\nto leeward--to drown--to die in the trough of the sea--eh?\"\r\n\r\nI did not reply to the mocking question, as I was not yet in\r\npossession of all my faculties.\r\n\r\n\"Aha!  Antonio el Cubano does not die so easily,\" resumed the Spanish\r\nCreole; \"but now what am I to do with you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You will release me, I hope, as I have never harmed you.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose did you come up these rocks, hombre?\" he asked,\r\nwith a keen glance.\r\n\r\n\"Only to survey the island from a new point of view,\" I replied,\r\nevasively.\r\n\r\n\"The top of the mountain would be a better place for that purpose,\"\r\nhe replied, grimly.\r\n\r\n\"But it is a much more laborious ascent.\"\r\n\r\n\"So the _Eugenie_ has been cast away?\"\r\n\r\n\"She was struck by lightning, took fire, and was burned to the water\r\nedge.\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this, Antonio ground his sharp teeth, and said, with a\r\nsavage malediction,--\r\n\r\n\"Por grados, as I said before, I will rid the world of you all!\"\r\n\r\n\"For myself,\" I began, with some agitation----\r\n\r\n\"If I permit you to return alive to these men,\" he replied, sternly,\r\n\"you will enable them to track me out.  But see you _this_,\" he\r\nadded, showing me a revolver; \"I will make them all food for the\r\nsea-gulls and the wild boars if they attempt to molest me.\"\r\n\r\nIt was one of those which had hung in Captain Weston's cabin.  It\r\nappeared to be loaded and capped; and though very rusty, was still\r\nsufficiently dangerous.  I remembered that he had put it in his\r\nbreast before he fell overboard.\r\n\r\n\"As for you,\" he resumed, and paused.\r\n\r\n\"I never harmed _you_, as you have frequently said.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you _laughed_ as I swung at the end of the studding-sail boom.\r\nIt was a fine joke to see a spar, with the world at one end and a\r\npoor devil holding on at the other!  I can remember that, senor,\r\nthough you may find it convenient to forget it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not aware, Antonio, that I did laugh,\" said I, in my most\r\nconciliatory tone.\r\n\r\n\"But I am quite aware of it, demonio,\" said he, furiously.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! why am I always doomed to meet this man?\" I exclaimed bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"True,\" said he, with another malevolent grin, \"I am a very horrid\r\nfellow; but we have met before we had the good luck to sail together.\"\r\n\r\n\"Before--I know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"At Teneriffe,\" said he; \"up among the mountains.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were the sentinel who stood at the mouth of the cavern?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was _not_, muchacho.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who or which, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He who was shot,\" said he, grinning.\r\n\r\n\"And who fell into the ventana?\"\r\n\r\n\"Si, hombre!\" (yes, man) replied the Cubano, with a shout of fierce\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\nAbsurd as this statement was, it was not without a horrid effect upon\r\nme for a moment, as he added,--\r\n\r\n\"Par los Santos! it is not so easy to kill Antonio!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I actually met you on the mountain side in Teneriffe?\"\r\n\r\n\"So it would seem.  A few of us had been ashore from the Costa Rican\r\nbrig, the _Marshal Serrano_, in search of a diamond which is said to\r\nshine at night in the rocks there; but as our search was vain, we\r\nthought of raising a few silver dollars on you and your companions,\r\nas all our trouble had gone for nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you reach this island?\" I asked, willing, if possible,\r\nby conversing with him to gain his better mood.\r\n\r\n\"I was swept astern of the brig when the studding-sail boom parted,\r\nbut I clung to it with a death clutch, and the waves, as they rose\r\nand fell, soon hid the _Eugenie_ from me; but before that, every time\r\nI rose, half blinded, winking and spluttering on the summit of a\r\nwave, and saw her sails and spars and cabin windows glittering and\r\nlooming large in the clear twilight, I sent a bitter malediction\r\nafter her.  However, I soon wearied of that, as it spent my breath,\r\nand when that went, the water always closed over my head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had you no fear, Antonio?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear--of what?\" he asked, scornfully.\r\n\r\n\"Of death--of drowning,\" said I, earnestly.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell what I felt; at least I had no thought of swimming,\r\nfor there was no land that I knew of to swim to nearer than Brazil,\r\nwhich was perhaps fifteen hundred miles distant; so as life is dear,\"\r\n(I thought of the lives he had destroyed) \"I clung to the spar in the\r\nhope of being picked up by some passing ship.\r\n\r\n\"I slipped off a coat, two waistcoats, and a pair of boots which had\r\nbelonged to the captain, and every nook of which I had crammed with\r\nmoney, watches, and other valuables of his and Hislop's\" (and my\r\nmother's parting gift--thought I), \"and with another malediction, I\r\nlet them go to the bottom of the sea, or the bellies of the sharks, I\r\ncared not which.\r\n\r\n\"The red sun had set, and night, with all its stars, came on.  The\r\nsilvered sea was pleasant, warm, and smooth.  I felt certain I could\r\nfloat by the spar all night, but my sole fear was for a blue shark,\r\nand every thing that sparkled in the water near me, made me draw my\r\nknees up to my chin, and my heart leap to my mouth, as I expected to\r\nbe bitten in two or have all the flesh torn off my legs at a mouthful.\r\n\r\n\"By my necktie, I lashed my left arm tightly to the spar, so that if\r\nweariness came over me, even for a moment, it might not be swept from\r\nme, because, if such an accident happened in the night, I might never\r\nrecover it again.  So there were the studding-sail boom and I\r\nfloating, adrift and alone, in the middle of the South Atlantic.\r\n\r\n\"I found that we were borne by a current due eastward, and I hoped\r\nthat it would carry me near some ship that might be running with it\r\ntoward the Cape.\r\n\r\n\"Day dawned.\r\n\r\n\"And there, about a Spanish league off, I saw this island, with the\r\nlight clouds floating midway between its blue summit and the\r\ngolden-colored sea.  It was so like Teneriffe that I could have sworn\r\nI saw the white houses of Santa Cruz, with the ships at anchor in the\r\nbay, the dark Valley of the Diamond opening inland, and the Spanish\r\nflag flying on the old castle; and so strong is fancy, that _par\r\ntodos santos!_ I _did_ see them all for a time.  But some hours\r\nafter, I was thrown by the waves with a shock upon the beach, where I\r\nlay long--I cannot tell how long--in a stupor, exhausted, worn-out,\r\nand all but dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a strange story,\" said I, as the Cubano, who told it in very\r\ngood Spanish, paused--\r\n\r\n\"As I came back to the world,\" he resumed, \"savage and bloody\r\nthoughts occurred to me!  Again I was swinging above the waves at the\r\nboom-end; again I saw all your exulting faces line the bulwark of the\r\n_Eugenie_; again I was in the sea!\r\n\r\n\"Then, horrid monsters, red-eyed and covered with shining bristles,\r\nwere about to devour me.  I felt their cold noses and their hot\r\nbreaths upon my face; and with a yell of terror, I half rose up to\r\nfind myself lying high and dry above the tide-mark, but among the\r\nsea-weed and shingle, blubber, star and jelly-fish of a warm beach,\r\non which the evening sun was shining; and that the bristly monsters\r\nof my dreams were a herd of wild boars in council (_consejo_) about\r\ndevouring me; but they scampered into the woods when slowly and\r\nfeebly I staggered up, like one after a long debauch.\r\n\r\n\"My left arm was still lashed to the boom, from which I now released\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"As I stood erect, shore and cliff, sea and mountain, swam round me,\r\nand then I became assailed by thirst and hunger.\r\n\r\n\"The nearest spring fully relieved one longing, and a wild gourd,\r\nwhich I nearly devoured, satisfied the other.  I remained long in\r\nthought, considering where I had been cast, and as night came on, and\r\nthe moon arose, the fear of savages or wild animals made me climb\r\ninto a tree.\r\n\r\n\"I had no clothes but what you see; a pair of tattered calziones de\r\nmarinero (sailor's trousers), and my sash; but, diabolo! did I not\r\nutter a shout, when, on examining it, I found that in the folds there\r\nwere still my knife--my old Albacete knife--and one of the captain's\r\nrevolvers, with a little tin case, which I had taken from his cabin.\r\nI then conceived that it might contain jewellery--_now_ I hoped it\r\nwas food--a case of sardines at the least!\r\n\r\n\"It was soldered and water-tight, so I forced the lid with my knife,\r\nand found that it contained caps and ammunition for the revolver!\r\n\r\n\"Thus, without fear, I supplied myself with food, until the arrival\r\nof your crew upon the island.  I was hidden among some mangroves on\r\nthe day when the long-boat came into the creek.  I knew you all, and\r\nmy heart swelled with rage as I covered you in succession with this\r\npistol; but as every charge was, perhaps, a day's food to me, and I\r\nvalued my scanty ammunition more than your wretched lives, I spared\r\nthem, intending to cut you off otherwise, when any straggler came\r\nwithin reach of my knife; and, as you know, with a large stone, I\r\nnearly marred forever the seamanship of the contra-maestre.  So\r\nthat's all my yarn, and what do you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think that when Heaven has so miraculously spared you, Antonio,\r\nyour mind should have other thoughts than vengeance now.\"\r\n\r\nThe dark Cubano gnashed his white teeth, and laughed bitterly; but\r\nnow, by his story, the disappearance of the boom from the\r\nmountain-top, the thefts from our bread-bag, the alleged pistol\r\nreports, and those appearances of a human figure on the bluffs in the\r\nmoonlight, the wounded goat, and every thing else which had so\r\ngreatly perplexed us of late, was completely accounted for; and\r\nfortunately for me, in the relation of his adventures, the Cubano had\r\ntalked himself into a state of comparative equanimity.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said I, rising, \"you will permit me to go, Antonio; and if you\r\ndo, I promise to leave you a dozen of biscuits to-morrow on the rock\r\nat the foot of the cliff.\"\r\n\r\n\"As a ransom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, biscuits are more valuable than golden doubloons here; but\r\nmight they not be a snare?\" he asked, with a savage gleam in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I swear it is not!\" I exclaimed, with the greatest earnestness.\r\n\r\n\"Bueno--very well--you may go.  You see how I am armed; so tell the\r\ncontra-maestre and his men that if they attempt to molest me, they\r\nshall share the fate of those who died in the brig.  So\r\n_vaya_--begone!\"\r\n\r\nThis was all said in Spanish--he had spoken nothing else--and not\r\nwithout a wild dignity of manner that was rather impressive.\r\n\r\nI lost no time in creeping or clambering out of his hiding-place.\r\n\r\n\"Buenos noches,\" said I, for the sun was now set; and not without\r\nfear that Antonio might change his wayward mind, and send a bullet\r\nthrough my back, I scrambled, rolled, ran, and went at times headlong\r\nand endlong down the back of the cliff in my anxiety to get beyond\r\nhis reach, and rejoin my companions, whom I found debating on my\r\ndisappearance and assembled in solemn conclave near the hut, where\r\nBurnet, the ship-cook, was roasting a kid for supper, and where I was\r\nreceived by a shout of welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE FATA MORGANA.\r\n\r\nThe former horror of my companions for Antonio was now revived and\r\nincreased by the mystery of his almost supernatural escape, and their\r\neyes wandered upward to the brow of the steep cliff whereon he\r\nlurked.  It was visible about two miles from where we were assembled\r\non the beach, and presented a rugged and savage outline.\r\n\r\nSome of them, among whom were Hislop and Probart the carpenter, urged\r\nthat at all hazards we should still attempt to storm his nest, and\r\npunish him by lynch law.\r\n\r\n\"With his revolver, rusty as it is,\" said I, \"he is as strong as he\r\nwas when on board the _Eugenie_, and when he held the cabin against\r\nus all; he could shoot each of us down at leisure, and with his knife\r\nfinish what the bullet might leave undone.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can fire the jungle,\" said Tattooed Tom, \"and burn him out like a\r\nrat.\"\r\n\r\nOthers proposed that we should act as we had hitherto done--keeping a\r\nstrict watch upon our boat and property, and permitting Antonio to\r\nremain unmolested until the arrival of a ship, to whose captain we\r\nshould commit the whole affair.\r\n\r\nWe came to no decision, but talked a great deal while supping on the\r\nroasted kid in the moonlight at the door of the hut; but ere long\r\nthere occurred an incident so strange, and apparently so\r\nunaccountable, that it soon decided the intentions of our crew.\r\n\r\nThe moon had risen, as it only rises in these latitudes, with the\r\nbrilliance of day, and with a white light that is dazzlingly pure.\r\nFrom where we were squatted among the sea-grass that bordered the\r\nshore, the whole sweep of the bight or bay which we had first\r\nentered, and on the margin of which we had built our hut beside the\r\nrocks, could be seen vividly in all its details.\r\n\r\nIt was an opening of about two miles from headland to headland.  Each\r\nof these were bold and rugged bluffs of great height--one being that\r\nstupendous rock which was tufted with trees, and which (with the\r\nmountain now shrouded in light clouds) we had first descried from the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe beach between was a complete bow of white sand, beyond which were\r\nthick groves of trees, and some wild palmettoes that tufted the dark\r\nrocks which formed the horns of the bay.\r\n\r\nIn a straight line from each of these horns ran a slender ridge of\r\nsnow-white surf, that was forever boiling up, rolling and breaking\r\nover a hidden coral reef, or sandbank.  Within it the bay, and\r\nwithout it the sea, were, on this night, smooth, waveless, and calm\r\nas the cloudless sky, whose deep immensity of blue was mirrored in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere was scarcely a breath of wind to stir the pendent forest leaves.\r\n\r\nI have been somewhat minute in describing all this, in consequence of\r\nthe phenomenon which occurred on this night, and thus fixed the\r\nfeatures of the scene in my memory.\r\n\r\nIt might have been about the hour of ten, and we were still loitering\r\non the moonlit beach, when the cry of \"A sail in sight!\" made every\r\nheart leap wildly and with hope.\r\n\r\n'Twas Tom Lambourne who spoke, but every eye caught the ship at once,\r\nand even those who had been dozing on the warm sand or within the hut\r\nwere awake and on the beach in a moment, stretching their hands\r\ntoward her with joy and exultation, but the aspect of the ship\r\ngradually changed all this into suspense and utter bewilderment.\r\n\r\nShe was a large square-rigged vessel--a ship running close-hauled on\r\nthe port-tack (to use a man-o'-war phrase) and with nearly all her\r\ncanvas set.\r\n\r\nShe was about four miles off the reef at the entrance of the bay, and\r\nwas bearing directly toward it.  Her canvas glimmered like snow in\r\nthe moonshine, and we could see the red lights of her cabin windows\r\nflash at times upon the sea astern, and the whiteness of her long\r\nflush deck, as she careened before the breeze.\r\n\r\nYet how was it, we all asked, that there was not a breath of wind\r\nwith us?\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps she brings it with her,\" suggested Hislop.\r\n\r\n\"And how came it to pass that she appeared right in the offing and\r\noutside the bay _all at once_?\" asked Tom Lambourne.\r\n\r\n\"She must have rounded the high bluff while we were all palavering,\"\r\nsaid Probart.\r\n\r\nNothing more was said for a time, but whether it was the effect of\r\nimagination or of an overstrained eyesight, I know not, she seemed to\r\nmelt as it were in the brightness of the moonshine--to become so\r\nindistinct that we could see the line of the horizon through her\r\ntopsails; and next it seemed as if her hull, her spars, and rigging,\r\nwere edged with bright prismatic hues.\r\n\r\nBut on she came, right for the bay, braced sharp to the wind; and now\r\nwe saw her sail-trimmers set the flying jib and haul the spanker\r\nfurther aft to steady her steerage.\r\n\r\nAt that moment the sea assumed a singularly luminous aspect; and now\r\nshe was but a mile off the surf-beaten reef.\r\n\r\nOn came the large ship, with every thing set aloft and alow--a cloud\r\nof white canvas from her deck to her trucks; but that which puzzled\r\nus most and silenced us all, was the circumstance that although there\r\nwas not a breath of wind to stir the leaves on shore, as she\r\napproached she careened well over, like a vessel under the influence\r\nof a fine spanking breeze--rising and falling regularly and\r\ngracefully, as if she rode over the heaving of a succession of long\r\nwaves--her courses, top-sails, topgallant-sails, royals, headsails,\r\nand spanker, all bellying out--the leaches forming complete arcs over\r\nher deck, her loose rigging all blown out in bends, and yet there was\r\nnot an inch of foam under her forefoot, and she left no wake astern\r\nupon the sea.\r\n\r\nWhat mystery was this?\r\n\r\nShe was like the mere reflection of a ship cast by a magic lantern on\r\na wall, save that she seemed instinct with life, for we had seen\r\nfresh canvas set upon her, while her royals and topgallant-sails\r\nshivered at times, as if the breeze we could not feel failed with her\r\nsomewhat aloft, or the hand at her wheel was unsteady, and unable to\r\nkeep her full and by.  Then, just as she approached the entrance of\r\nthe little bay, all her cabin fights went out!\r\n\r\n\"She will be ashore on the reef if she draws deep!\" cried every\r\nvoice.  But no! she glided over it or through it, without shivering,\r\nshock, or hindrance, and ran into the bay.\r\n\r\n\"Her false keel must have gone through it like a knife,\" said\r\nLambourne, with amazement.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps her draught of water is small,\" suggested the carpenter,\r\nwhile the excitement of our men increased every moment.\r\n\r\n\"Why don't the lubbers take some canvas off her?\" exclaimed one.\r\n\r\n\"Or heave her in the wind?\" added another.\r\n\r\n\"There's the jib-sheet let fly: down royals and in topgallant-sails!\r\nWhy don't you heave her in the wind?  Ready your anchors!\" cried\r\nHislop loudly in his astonishment, as he shouted to those on board,\r\nand rushed mid-leg into the water.  \"Heavens!\" he added, \"she still\r\nbears on, cracking under every thing!  She will be ashore in a\r\nminute, and then all her sticks will snap by the board like\r\ntobacco-pipes!\"\r\n\r\nA cry escaped us all as her flying jib-boom appeared right over a\r\ngrove of little trees; then her bow touched the white sandy beach;\r\nbut there was neither shock nor pause as she seemed to sail right on\r\nand inland, still careening over and still rising, falling, and\r\nheaving, as if upon the sea.\r\n\r\nAs I gazed upon her a strange and paralyzing sensation came over me,\r\nand all my faculties became frozen.  The profound silence of the\r\nscene, the calm landscape of the moonlit isle, and the noiselessness\r\nof the ocean, made us stare at her and at each other as men in a\r\ntrance.  My breath became suspended, my heart seemed to stand still\r\nin all its pulses, while this mysterious--this most spectral\r\nship--passed before us like a living thing, and then melted away in\r\nthe moonshine, apparently right under the cliff of Antonio, leaving\r\nus to gaze at each other, in doubt as to whether we were mad or not.\r\n\r\nHislop was the first to recover himself, and striking his hands\r\ntogether, with the air of one to whose astonishment had succeeded the\r\nbitterness of a deep disappointment, he exclaimed,--\r\n\r\n\"It is only the phenomenon called Fata Morgana!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nMAROONED.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible for me to describe the blank astonishment, or rather\r\nthe intense consternation, of our men on the disappearance of this\r\nvessel, which was the object of so many hopes and wishes.\r\n\r\nSome time elapsed before the poor fellows rallied sufficiently to\r\nspeak on the subject; and meanwhile, there flashed upon my memory,\r\nsome strange and weird old Celtic tales, which a Highland boy at Eton\r\nwas wont to tell us, of ships which in the days of Ossian, traversed\r\nthe steep hills and the salt lochs of Morven with equal facility.\r\n\r\n\"It is a ship--or rather the representation of a veritable\r\nship--which cannot be far off the island, and is making for it at\r\nthis moment,\" said Hislop, emphatically.\r\n\r\n\"How far off do you think she is, sir?\" asked Hugh Chute, mockingly.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps twenty miles--perhaps a hundred--it is impossible to say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps ten thousand?\" queried Tom Lambourne, with great irritation.\r\n\r\n\"It was the ship of the Flying Dutchman!\" said Probart, the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"I've seen many a queer thing in my time, but never the like of this\r\nbefore!\" exclaimed Carlton.\r\n\r\n\"Though foul weather don't matter much to us here, it will be sure to\r\nfollow;--so I say, mates,\" resumed Probart, \"it was the Flying\r\nDutchman and nought else!\"\r\n\r\n\"Vanderdecken or the devil come for Antonio,\" added Ned Carlton; \"and\r\nwhether he has shipped aboard that craft or not, hang me shipmates,\r\nif we should stay another hour on the island with it, or with him, or\r\nwhere such things are seen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said all the rest; \"let us take to the long-boat again,\r\nand sheer off.\"\r\n\r\n\"For where?\" asked Hislop, coming forward.\r\n\r\n\"Anywhere,\" replied Lambourne, sulkily.\r\n\r\n\"Stuff!  You must hang on by the island, or it will be the worse for\r\nyou,\" responded the wary mate.\r\n\r\n\"How will it be worse for us?\" asked Probart.\r\n\r\n\"In more ways than one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.  And moreover, it is my orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lookee, now, Master Hislop,\" said Henry Warren, our oldest seaman,\r\nwith great gravity, \"in everything that is reasonable, I have obeyed\r\nyou, and I will still obey you all the same as if the deck of the\r\n_Eugenie_ was under our feet, and the blue water round us; but as for\r\nliving on this here 'chanted island for a longer spell, with a\r\nmurdering villain like the Spaniard Antonio, who can make ships sail\r\non sea and land alike, for all the world like pictures in a lantern\r\nor a penny show, is more than flesh and blood can bear; so I say,\r\nmates, let us embark all our provisions, set sail, clap dry nippers\r\non our oars, and make out Gough's Island, or Tristan da Cunha,\r\nleaving the devil and Antonio to keep company here as long as they\r\nplease--and that is likely to be long enough, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tristan da Cunha can't be above three hundred miles off,\" added\r\nProbart; and the proposition met with such universal approbation,\r\nthat Marc Hislop became seriously alarmed.\r\n\r\nHe begged the crew to listen to him; but they did so with evident\r\nreluctance and impatience, muttering the while, and twitching their\r\nhats and trousers.\r\n\r\nHe said every thing he could think of to assure them that the ship\r\nthey had seen was quite an optical illusion; and his arguments,\r\nthough they might have been convincing enough to the old Dominican\r\nfriar, Antonio Minasi, who thrice saw the Fata Morgana in the Straits\r\nof Messina, or to Sir David Brewster, they totally failed to assure\r\nTattooed Tom, old Probart our carpenter, Jack Burnet the cook, and\r\nothers, that it was merely a natural phenomenon, to be accounted for\r\nthrough some form of dioptrical refraction, by means of which a ship\r\nsailing on one part of the ocean might be reflected on _another_, or,\r\nas we had just seen, even on the land itself.\r\n\r\n\"I assure you, my lads,\" he continued, \"she was the representation of\r\na vessel now under sail elsewhere.  You all saw that the sea and bay\r\nwere calm as glass, that the ship was braced sharp to the wind, with\r\nher port tacks aboard, while we had none, not even a catspaw on the\r\nwater, or a leaf stirring on shore.  You saw that she careened, as if\r\nbeneath its influence, and rose and fell as if running through a\r\nheavy sea.  You saw the cabin lights go out, and the flying-jib\r\nhoisted.  Thus it was quite evident that by something indescribable\r\nin the state of the atmosphere, her form and motions were taken up\r\nelsewhere, and mirrored _here_.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand all this fine talk,\" said Tom Lambourne, sulkily,\r\n\"and I don't care if I never do.  I ain't a scholar, but a\r\nhardworking foremast-man, that has seen every land under the sun.  So\r\nby your leave, or without it, we shall make the long-boat ready for\r\nsea.  Come, my lads; we shall fill the watercasks at the spring\r\nyonder, and get what remains in the bread bags, with all the other\r\nstuff we've collected, aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah!\" cried the crew, \"hurrah for blue water!\"\r\n\r\n\"Get the mast stepped, and all the gear ready; we'll be at sea in an\r\nhour, or my name ain't Tattooed Tom Lambourne.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rodney,\" said Hislop, turning to me, bitterly, \"Goethe says that\r\npainting and tattooing are natural symptoms--the savage hankering\r\nafter the brute--and faith, I begin to think so.\"\r\n\r\nOld Tom Lambourne only half understood the remark; but it stung him\r\ndeeply.\r\n\r\n\"I don't deserve this at your hands, Master Hislop,\" said he; \"and it\r\nain't manly to upbraid a poor fellow with his misfortunes when\r\nshipwrecked among savages, and I tell you so--for all your\r\nbook-learning,\" he added, bitterly.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Tom, and I am wrong.  Pardon me, old ship-mate,\" said\r\nHislop, as they shook hands.\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly were our companions scared by the recent spectral\r\nappearance, which they connected in some way with the dreadful\r\ncharacter of Antonio el Cubano, that they at once commenced with\r\nalacrity the preparations for putting to sea.\r\n\r\nIt may be that somewhat of the professional restlessness of sailors\r\nconfirmed their resolution.\r\n\r\nThey were already tired of their sojourn on the island, and inspired\r\nby the desire of reaching Tristan da Cunha, which is inhabited by\r\nabout eighty families of Portuguese, English, and mulattoes, among\r\nwhom Hislop assured them they might linger long enough before they\r\nwere taken off by a passing ship--quite as long as if they remained\r\non the Isle of Alphonso--and where, for subsistence, they would be\r\nforced to work as day laborers in the savannas and on the highways.\r\n\r\nAs for the Island of Diego Alvarez, our Scotch mate, who seemed to\r\nknow every thing, assured them that it produced only moss and\r\nsea-grass, and that if cast there they would die of starvation.\r\nMoreover, without chart or compass, how could they hope to steer with\r\ncertainty in any direction?\r\n\r\nThey might all perish in detail by the most dreadful deaths in their\r\nopen boat, gasping with unquenched thirst under the blaze of a\r\ntropical sun.  He said much more; but they would listen to nothing\r\nsave their own fears and restless impulses.\r\n\r\nI, too, was weary of the island; and though feeling all the\r\ndespondency that follows a severe disappointment on the disappearance\r\nof the illusory ship, I in no way shared the wild and ill-regulated\r\nwishes of the crew, though assured that I would be compelled to\r\nfollow their desperate fortunes.\r\n\r\nHislop made a last effort to convince them that all they had seen was\r\nonly the reflection of a real object produced by natural causes, such\r\nas the dead calm that prevailed upon the sea--the moon shining from a\r\npoint where its incident ray formed an angle of 45° on the water--the\r\ninfluence of saline and other effluvia suspended in the air,\r\nproducing, as in a catoptric theatre, a vision by reflection; but\r\nfinding that they heeded all this no more than the wind, he fairly\r\nlost his temper, and bade them \"go and be hanged for stupid dolts.\"\r\n\r\nIt was perfectly natural that all this should sound strange to\r\nunlettered seamen; so they continued their preparations with all\r\nspeed and in silence, for they all loved Hislop, and were loth to\r\noffend him.\r\n\r\nTwo bags of bread which still remained, the kegs of rum, and four\r\ncasks newly filled with fresh water, were put on board the longboat,\r\ntogether with all our arduously collected store of kids' flesh,\r\nboars' hams, and sea-fowls' eggs.\r\n\r\nThe oars, boat tackle, and blankets were also shipped, and the whole\r\ncrew embarked at the mangrove creek, where the boat lay.\r\n\r\nHislop and I still lingered; so we were told peremptorily that if we\r\ndid not come on board at once, they would shove off without us.  Thus\r\ncompelled, we stepped in most reluctantly and seated ourselves in the\r\nstern, and he assumed the tiller.  The oars were run through the\r\nrow-locks, and Lambourne was about to shove off, when Probart, who\r\nhad the bow oar, suddenly remembered that he had left his hatchet\r\nnear our wigwam, and asked me to get it.\r\n\r\nI jumped ashore, and was proceeding along the beach for it, when\r\nsuddenly I was confronted by Antonio, who from a thicket had been\r\nwatching our operations and departure.\r\n\r\nHis tawny skin--for he was naked to the waist--his ferocious aspect,\r\nhis head of matted hair, his colossal strength, and atrocious\r\ncharacter were not without a due effect upon the boat's crew at this\r\ncrisis.\r\n\r\n\"Shove off--shove off!\" I heard several voices cry in the boat; \"here\r\ncomes that dog of a Cubano.\"\r\n\r\nI struggled with Antonio; but he laughed loudly, and drew his pistol\r\nwith the air of one who would enforce obedience; besides, his eyes,\r\nwhich the tangled masses of his hair overhung, were flashing with\r\nmalignant fire, as all the slumbering devil was roused within him.\r\n\r\nThe whole crew saw this, and I perceived that Marc Hislop made an\r\nattempt to rise up and spring overboard to my succor; but as all\r\ntheir hopes of reaching Tristan da Cunha depended entirely upon his\r\nskill and knowledge of navigation, he was seized by Warren, Chute,\r\nand others, roughly thrust down in the stern sheets, and forcibly\r\nheld there.\r\n\r\nI saw now that the fear and selfishness of the rest prevailed over\r\nall that Hislop, Lambourne, and Carlton could urge; for amid a storm\r\nof contending tongues, I perceived the oars dipping in the water\r\nagain and again, and flashing like silver blades in the moonlight as\r\nthey were feathered; and the longboat with all my companions, shot\r\nfrom the creek into the bay, and bore away to seaward about two in\r\nthe morning, leaving me on the beach alone--_marooned_ with the\r\nfiendish Cubano!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nA NEW DANGER.\r\n\r\nHad not Antonio held me fast, and menaced me with his pistol, I would\r\nhave sprung into the water, and undeterred by the sharks that were\r\nforever gliding stealthily about in the bay, would have swam after\r\nthe boat; for desperate though the fortune of those who were there, I\r\nwould rather have shared it than live on the island of Alphonso with\r\nsuch a companion.\r\n\r\nHis fierce mocking laugh grated harshly in my ear, but I heeded him\r\nnot, and continued to gaze after the boat and the lessening forms of\r\nthose who had abandoned me, not without a fond and desperate hope\r\nthat they would return for me.  Every moment I expected to see her\r\nput about; but no! she held steadily on, till hull, and sail, and\r\ncrew were blended into one little dark spot, which ere long could\r\nscarcely be discerned on the moonlit morning sea.\r\n\r\nHer course was trimmed north-east, for where they supposed the isle\r\nof Tristan da Cunha lay.  She had caught a breeze, and before four\r\no'clock in the morning, the last vestige of her had disappeared.\r\n\r\nStill I did not entirely despair!\r\n\r\nWhen day dawned, while my eyes were almost blinded by tears of rage\r\nand bitterness, I clambered in haste to the summit of the great\r\nbluff, and gazed eagerly to seaward, in the hope that the arguments\r\nor wishes of Hislop, of Carlton, and of blunt old Tom Lambourne\r\n_might have prevailed_, and that I should see her returning; but\r\nalas! there was nothing visible save a lonely albatross skimming\r\nlazily between me and the rising sun.\r\n\r\nExcept for the sake of Marc Hislop and one or two others, who in our\r\nparting interview had acted as my friends, I hoped--but this was in\r\nthe intense bitterness of my heart, at an abandonment so cruel--that\r\nthe longboat might swamp, founder, or perish, how I cared not.\r\n\r\nWhat was to become of me now?\r\n\r\nThe boat might fall in with some ship, and thus afford me a double\r\nchance of being taken off the island.  But would the captain of this\r\nsupposed ship bear up for the land if it lay far from his course?\r\n\r\nAmid these perplexing thoughts and surmises, my greatest source of\r\nannoyance was the odious companionship of the Cubano.\r\n\r\nI felt neither hunger nor sleep, though all the preceding night I had\r\nnever closed an eye; but now I remained upon the bluff, gazing on the\r\nsunlit sea, from under the shadow of a broad-leaved plantain, until I\r\nwas roused in the afternoon by Antonio, who joined me.\r\n\r\n\"_Hola! mio muchacho!_\" (hallo! my boy), he exclaimed; \"you promised\r\nme a dozen of biscuits if I released you from my hiding hole in\r\nyonder rock.  Now, biscuits are biscuits here, so where are those for\r\nwhich I ransomed you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gone in the boat with every thing else,\" I replied, sulkily and\r\nsternly.\r\n\r\n\"What!--all?\"\r\n\r\n\"Every thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do when my powder is done?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not, and I care not.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are but ten charges left,\" said he, gloomily, as he opened the\r\ntin case.\r\n\r\n\"What is that to me?\" I asked, with growing anger.\r\n\r\n\"It is this much to you, that if provisions fall short, I shall _eat\r\nyou_!\" he replied, with a fiendish grin, accompanied by an emphatic\r\noath.  \"Now, my fine fellow, what do you think of _that_?\"\r\n\r\nThe words of the wretch, his herculean frame and ferocious aspect,\r\nwhich the wild life he had lately spent among the woods of Alphonso\r\nhad not improved, made me shudder.\r\n\r\nOn remembering the manner in which we first found him floating in the\r\nopen boat at sea, the suspicions of Weston, Hislop, and Lambourne\r\nregarding the disappearance of a companion who had probably been with\r\nhim--suspicions which all his future conduct seemed to confirm, and\r\nknowing all he was capable of committing, my heart sickened with\r\ndisgust and apprehension; but the imminence of my own danger made me\r\ndissemble.\r\n\r\nWhile pretending to smile and to disbelieve him, I mentally\r\nconsidered how to arm myself, or how to deprive him of those weapons\r\nwhich, when added to his muscular strength and singularly brutal\r\nnature, rendered him an enemy so formidable.\r\n\r\nThe idea of swimming to one of the adjacent isles occurred to me; but\r\nthe straits between were full of foaming breakers and sharks; the\r\nrocks, moreover, were inaccessible, and wherever I might go Antonio\r\ncould easily follow.\r\n\r\nI remembered the carpenter's little hatchet, which was still lying\r\nupon the beach, and resolved to possess myself of it, to conceal it\r\nabout me, and to use it without mercy if occasion served or required.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear me speak, you English heathen?\" shouted Antonio,\r\nstriking me on the shoulder.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said I, shuddering again; for in addition to the load of crime\r\nwhich covered Antonio, I loathed him as the primary cause of all our\r\nmisfortunes, and of my present misery.\r\n\r\n\"Bueno--then look to it!\" said he, nodding.\r\n\r\n\"Look to what!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must take to kid-catching, and boar-hunting, else I may feed\r\nmyself, as I have done before, with whatever comes most readily to\r\nhand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall we not place a signal again on the mountain?\"\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose?\" he asked with a grimace.\r\n\r\n\"To attract a passing ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what shall we make it?\"\r\n\r\n\"The studding-sail boom--where is it concealed?\"\r\n\r\nAt the mention of the boom, the revengeful Cubano gnashed his teeth,\r\nand replied,--\r\n\r\n\"I have cast it where man's hand shall never get it, into a chasm on\r\nthe other side of the mountain; but voto! let us go down and repair\r\nthe hut those ladrones have left, and you,\" he added, with a grin,\r\n\"shall be my camarada de casa.\"\r\n\r\nThe sun was now setting beyond the sea, and the shadow of the great\r\nmountain was falling eastward over the island as we began to descend\r\nfrom the bluff, where I had lingered so long, by one of the narrow\r\nand winding tracks made through the gorse by the wild goats.\r\n\r\nHunger now assailed me, and saying I would hasten forward and procure\r\nsome bananas, I reached the beach before Antonio was half-way down\r\nthe rocks, and found Probart's hatchet where--so unfortunately for\r\nme--he had left it in the hurry of embarkation.\r\n\r\nI snatched it up, and as the handle was short, and the blade, though\r\nsharp, was small, I secured it in the waistband of my trousers, and\r\nbuttoned my now tattered jacket over it, determined to prove\r\ntherewith the hardness of Antonio's head on the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nAn emotion of security now filled my heart, as I felt that I had a\r\nweapon with which to strike at least one blow in defence of my life,\r\nif it was assailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLVER AGAIN.\r\n\r\nAs it was alike dangerous and uncomfortable to sleep under the dews\r\nthat descended after sunset, for two nights after the departure of\r\nthe boat, I was compelled to share the wigwam with Antonio, but did\r\nso with dread and loathing, and kept as far away from him as possible.\r\n\r\nHis dreams, which were full of oaths, ejaculations, and frequently\r\ncries of \"_El aparicion!  El espectro!_\" came on him as of old; and\r\nas sleep to me became an impossibility, I resolved to leave him to\r\nhis own devices.  Certainly the island was large enough for us both.\r\n\r\nMoreover, he had become so sparing of his ten charges of powder, that\r\nhe would not fire a single shot at either bird, or goat, or wild\r\nboar.  I have since believed that he saved them with the resolution\r\nof defending himself to the last, if Hislop ever returned to arrest\r\nhim; and now, being lord and master of the whole island, and of me\r\ntoo, he exhibited a new phase of character.\r\n\r\nHe became too lazy to procure food, and forced me to find it for him,\r\nunder threats of shooting me.  Thus for two days after the departure\r\nof the boat, being totally incapable of catching one of the fleet\r\ngoats alone, and being in no way disposed to encounter singly one of\r\nthe wild boars, I had to climb the steep rocks above the breakers to\r\nsteal the sea-birds' eggs.\r\n\r\nThis feat I achieved with considerable peril, for the birds, when\r\nroused from their eyries, whooped, screamed, and wheeled in flocks\r\nand circles about me, flapping their huge wings; so that once I\r\nbecame so bewildered, that instead of clambering again to the summit\r\nof the cliff, I began a descent toward the foaming sea below.\r\n\r\nIn reascending, my hat was blown away, and with it the wretched eggs\r\nfor which I had risked my life and limbs.\r\n\r\nAfter this event I resolved to procure food for myself alone, and\r\ninstead of returning to Antonio, who usually loitered about the hut\r\nour men had left, I went to the opposite side of the island, and\r\nfound a banana grove, wherein I took up my quarters.\r\n\r\nThe fruit, as it fell ripe from the trees, formed my food, and of the\r\nbroad leaves and some branches I made a little gipsy-like hut,\r\nwherein I might sleep at night without being drenched by the baleful\r\ntropical dew; for of it, and its subsequent fevers and ague, I had a\r\ngreat dread, for to become ill would ensure a death of hunger and\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\nIn that place, which resembled the lair of a wild animal, though I\r\nhad no fear of the awful solitude around me, I lay awake for half the\r\nnight, listening to the chafing of the surge, and shedding many a\r\nbitter tear for my home and those who were there--those whom I might\r\nnever see again--and longing, oh, how earnestly, how eagerly, and how\r\nprayerfully, for a passing ship!\r\n\r\nAnon, I would start up and rush forth to look about me and to listen,\r\nfearing that some craft might heave in sight on the other side of the\r\nisle, take off Antonio, and leave me!\r\n\r\nSuch a catastrophe would, I am assured, have driven me distracted.\r\n\r\nIn the wild life I led there, on the Island of Alphonso, it was\r\nstrange how sharp, how keenly acute every sense became, but more\r\nespecially those of touch and hearing.\r\n\r\nI had been thirty-six hours without seeing my pleasant chum, the\r\nCubano, or being near him with food.  I knew that his rage would be\r\ngreat, and feeling myself unusually weak, after all the mental\r\nexcitement and bodily exposure I had undergone, necessity now\r\ncompelled me to avoid him strictly, as I was totally incapable of\r\ncontending with him in any way.\r\n\r\nIf he found me, to plead that I had lost my way or had missed him, in\r\na space so small as our island, though wild and wooded, would\r\nscarcely prove an excuse.\r\n\r\nAnother dread haunted me, that if a ship of any nation, but more\r\nespecially of Spain, hove in sight, Antonio, to provide for his own\r\nfuture safety, might deem it necessary to dispose of me forever, lest\r\nI should accuse him of the many crimes he had committed.\r\n\r\nWithout the evidence of Hislop and others, such accusations, if made\r\nby me alone, would have no great weight; but he might not think of\r\nthat; and, moreover, was no doubt a steady believer in the old\r\nbuccaneer maxim, \"that dead men tell no tales.\"\r\n\r\nWhen searching for berries, about sunrise, on the western side of the\r\nisle, and while the sun, though up, was yet below the great mountain,\r\nand cast its shadow to the extreme horizon of the hazy morning sea, I\r\nencountered Antonio at last.\r\n\r\nStooping on my hands and knees, I was turning over the great leaves\r\nof some creeping plants that were unknown to me in search of some\r\nwild berries, which, as I had seen the birds eat them, must, I knew,\r\nbe harmless, when a severe blow on the head almost stunned me.\r\n\r\nOn looking up, there stood Antonio bending over me, with a savage\r\nscowl on his face, and his pistol clubbed as if about to repeat the\r\nassault.  His intentions were evidently hostile, as he placed a foot\r\nupon my hatchet, which lay near, and his left hand grasped his knife.\r\n\r\nEvery way I was totally at his mercy!\r\n\r\nHunger, apparently, had rendered him furious; but feeling certain in\r\na moment that timidity would do me no service, I started back and\r\nsaid in Spanish,--\r\n\r\n\"Villain! for what have you dared to strike me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dared,\" he reiterated; \"ha! ha! much daring there is about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, you dog of a picaro!\"\r\n\r\n\"For what reason did you desert me, you raterillo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I could scarcely procure food for myself, and still less for\r\na lazy ruffian like you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha! I told you what would happen when I wanted food,\" said he,\r\nfeeling the point of his knife.\r\n\r\nMy blood ran cold at these words, and I cast a longing eye upon my\r\nlost hatchet; he saw the glance, and trampled upon the weapon with a\r\nmocking laugh.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Cubano?\" I asked, in an almost breathless voice.\r\n\r\n\"Simply this: that as self-preservation is the first law of nature, I\r\nam bound to kill you.\"\r\n\r\nHe had the revolver in his hand, and while he cast a glance at the\r\ncaps on the breech, as if to see that they were all right, and\r\nsheathed his knife, I made a bound aside, and placed a banana-tree\r\nbetween us.  The dastard fired, and the ball, as it whistled past,\r\nstripped off a piece of bark.\r\n\r\nIn the same manner, I escaped a second shot, so Antonio, finding that\r\nhis much-prized ammunition was likely to be expended fruitlessly,\r\nrushed forward to use his knife.\r\n\r\nThe tendril of a pumpkin caught his left foot; he fell heavily, and\r\nhurt himself severely.  Then, darting past, I secured my hatchet, and\r\nrendered furious by all that had occurred, and by the imminent danger\r\nwhich menaced me, a light seemed to flash before my eyes, I trembled\r\nwith rage, and felt as if endued by a supernatural strength.\r\n\r\nI was about to spring upon Antonio, with hands, feet, and teeth,--to\r\nhew at him with the hatchet as I would have hewn at a tree--when a\r\nnew object suddenly caught my eye.\r\n\r\nIt was a ship--but a ship ashore!\r\n\r\n\"Cubano,\" I exclaimed, in a husky voice, \"look there!\"\r\n\r\nAntonio looked in the direction indicated, and pausing in his\r\nmurderous intention, uttered a fierce laugh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nIn the rocky channel which opened between the inaccessible island and\r\nours, there lay the wave-beaten hull of a dismasted vessel, which\r\nmust have been drifted in over night, as it was certainly not there\r\nyesterday, and it was now jammed hard and fast upon a reef of rock\r\nthat connected them.\r\n\r\nThis new object changed at once the terrible current of the Cubano's\r\nideas.  A grim smile passed over his olive countenance; he shook back\r\nthe elf-like masses of coal-black hair which, in Skye-terrier\r\nfashion, overhung his wild dark eyes, and sheathing his knife, said,--\r\n\r\n\"Mio muchacho--come; I was only joking.  Yonder we shall find food,\r\nperhaps, and who knows what more?  Come, it is a bargain; and if you\r\ndon't desert me, I shall not molest you again.\"\r\n\r\nHe proceeded at once toward the beach, and I was hungry enough, and\r\nperhaps reckless enough now, to be glad of a truce, and to follow\r\nhim, in the hope of finding something eatable on board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nA WATERLOGGED VESSEL.\r\n\r\nDescending the rocks, which were steep and rugged, we reached their\r\nbase, where a dangerous and treacherous beach sloped abruptly down\r\ninto the deep water.  It was covered with frothy sea-weed,\r\nbright-colored shells, strange-looking pieces of blubber, and decayed\r\nfish of many kinds.\r\n\r\nOver some large misshapen rocks, which were covered by masses of\r\nbarnacles and long tangles of sea-weed that waved in the water, but\r\nwhich adhered to the stone with the tenacity of steel bands, we\r\nreached--but not without considerable difficulty, and being partly\r\nimmersed in the foam that boiled over the reef connecting the\r\nislands--the wreck that lay hard and fast upon it.\r\n\r\nBy her build she was evidently a new Spanish brig of somewhere about\r\none hundred and fifty tons burden, and straight as an arrow in her\r\nsheer stroke, which had been painted yellow.\r\n\r\nHer masts were gone by the board, and her bowsprit had been snapped\r\noff near the cap.  Every vestige of the bulwarks had long since been\r\ntorn away by the waves that had swept over her; and the skeleton row\r\nof her timber-heads, the windlass-bitts, and the booby-hatch, alone\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nHer hull had been swept of every thing else.\r\n\r\nShe had evidently been long tossing to and fro, perhaps for six\r\nmonths, exposed to wind and weather.  Nearly every vestige of paint\r\nhad long since been washed from her hull by the waves, or scorched\r\nfrom it by the sun.\r\n\r\nHer copper was thickly encrusted with barnacles, and coated with long\r\ntrailers of sea-weed.\r\n\r\nSingularly lonely, silent, and desolate she looked, as she lay on the\r\nreef, heeled over to starboard, with the bleached or washed ends of\r\nher shrouds and rattlins hanging from the dead-eyes over the side\r\nchannel-boards in the water; and then, to add to the effect of the\r\nwhole, three huge and lazy albatrosses gorged with star-fish and\r\nblubber, alighted on her taffrail, and flapped their dusky wings with\r\na melancholy booming sound.\r\n\r\nAs we clambered on board by the ruins of the main-rigging, which hung\r\npendent over the port-side, an exclamation of disgust escaped even\r\nAntonio when we saw the miserable remains of a poor human being,\r\nhanging by the wasted and bony legs, which were jammed in the iron\r\ngear about the fore-channel; it had, when in life, been lashed\r\nthereto, and now hung pendent, with the head, arms, and body immersed\r\nin the water; and these relics had evidently been dragged about with\r\nthe wreck exposed to the waves, the sun, the fish, and the sea-birds\r\nfor many months.\r\n\r\nOf the crew we saw no other traces, and their probable fate was left\r\nto gloomy conjecture.\r\n\r\nRemoving the booby-hatch, we descended into her cabin, and found it\r\nhalf full of water, amid which the débris of the lockers had been\r\nlong washed to and fro.  There were blankets and clothing, cushions\r\nand pillows, bottles, glasses, cigar-boxes, Spanish packs of cards\r\nhaving cudgels for clubs, _espados_ for spades; and there, too, were\r\ncharts and books reduced to mere pulp by long immersion.\r\n\r\nThe skylight was gone; but on the cabin-windows we still saw the\r\ndead-lights, as those ports or shutters are named which are usually\r\nshipped in rough weather to prevent high seas from breaking in.\r\n\r\nThe place had a chill feeling--a dreary and desolate aspect; for many\r\nmonths the water had been washing there from bulkhead to bulkhead and\r\nfrom stem to stern.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of my hatchet we forced a passage into the bread-room,\r\nas the locker wherein bread or biscuit is usually kept is named.  It\r\nwas entirely lined with tin, to exclude rats; but this had failed to\r\nexclude water, for the bags of biscuit, which to us would have been\r\nmore valuable than sacks of diamonds or doubloons, had all been\r\nreduced to mouldy pulp and paste long ago.\r\n\r\nAntonio seemed in his element; his eyes sparkled with a lurid glare;\r\nhis limbs appeared to dilate and strengthen as he hewed and hacked\r\naway at the panels and bulkheads in quest of food and plunder, so he\r\nsoon forced his way through the fore and after holds, and, indeed,\r\nover all the wreck; while the blows of the hatchet, and the sound of\r\nhis voice, as he shouted and swore to himself, sounded hollow and\r\nstrange in the hitherto long-abandoned ship.\r\n\r\nA little examination proved her to be a Spanish brig, timber laden,\r\nprincipally with mahogany, and completely waterlogged.  Thus she\r\ncould never sink.\r\n\r\nShe was probably from the Bay of Honduras.  We found several coils of\r\nManilla rope on board, and some cocoa-nuts entire.  She was\r\noak-built, copper-fastened, and coppered to the bends.\r\n\r\n\"She had not made the land in her last voyage,\" said Antonio; \"and a\r\nstorm must have overtaken and dismasted her at sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know this?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Because one anchor--her best bower--still remains in the bow, and\r\nthe cables have not been bent, but are stowed in the tier below.  Her\r\nworking anchor and kedge have both gone or been sent overboard to\r\nlighten her.\"\r\n\r\nAnd then, as if he had wasted time enough, Antonio descended to renew\r\nthe ransacking of the vessel; and ere long I heard him utter a shrill\r\nhowl of delight.\r\n\r\nHe had discovered a square box, entirely filled with case-bottles of\r\nJamaica rum!  To one who, like him, had been so long deprived of his\r\nfavorite stimulants, this discovery was more valuable than a gold\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nI cannot say that I shared his delight in this matter, knowing well\r\nthat the wretch would drink to excess, and then there would be\r\ngreater reason than ever to dread his presence.\r\n\r\nOur investigation had occupied almost the entire day, and it was\r\nabout the time of sunset when Antonio found his prize.  Knowing well\r\nthe danger of getting ashore in the dusk along the ridge of the reef\r\nand up the weed-covered rocks of the island, I urged the Cubano to\r\nreturn at once, as I had a dislike of remaining all night in a\r\nwaterlogged wreck, which any rise of the wind or sea might take off\r\nthe coast again; but Antonio only mocked me, and was deaf to my\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nHe drank at least a pint of rum in a few minutes, and this prostrated\r\nhis energies for the time; so, leaving him half-seated in the water\r\nthat washed and gurgled about the cabin, with his back propped\r\nagainst the after bulkhead, the spirit box placed between his legs,\r\nand a square case-bottle in each hand, I prepared to sheer off and\r\nget ashore ere worse came to pass.\r\n\r\nAll the plunder I brought away with me consisted of a book, which I\r\nfound, half defaced by water, on a shelf, and a small sword, like a\r\n_couteau de chasse_, that hung on a hook in one of the cabin berths,\r\nand which, unseen by Antonio, I concealed in my trousers, as he had\r\nlost my hatchet somewhere in the fore-hold, and I had no other weapon\r\nwith which to defend myself if attacked.\r\n\r\nI had eaten nothing but half a cocoa-nut all day, and felt weak and\r\ngiddy when lowering myself off the wreck by the main-chains.\r\n\r\nIn the tropics the sun sets rapidly, and already the reef was\r\ndarkened by the shadows of the two islands between which it lay.\r\nTheir rocks were black as marble; but the sea, and all the surf\r\nbetween them, were white as milk by the reflection of the snowy\r\nclouds on which the rising moon was shining.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene of the silent and waterlogged wreck was solemn and\r\nimpressive; and a gloomy horror was added to it by the ghastly\r\nremains of the dead man, which hung and were washed to and fro\r\nalongside, head downward, from the fore-channel--swaying with a\r\ngurgling sound, as if he was essaying to rise from the water.\r\n\r\nShudderingly I turned away, and wading through the surf, clambered\r\nover the piles of slippery and weedy boulders, to regain the higher\r\nportion of the Island of Alphonso.\r\n\r\nAs I ascended, the voice of Antonio, now somewhat cracked and\r\nwavering, reached me, as he put his head above the booby-hatch, and\r\nsung a Spanish ditty, one verse of which ran thus:\r\n\r\n  \"Companero, companero,\r\n    She is gone that ruled my heart!\r\n  Companero, companero,\r\n    That was sorrow's deepest smart.\r\n  But companero, companero,\r\n    Here's the bota, drink your fill;\r\n  For companero, companero,\r\n    Wine's the cure for every ill!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point of his song he suddenly vanished.  Probably his foot\r\nslipped, and if so, he would fall souse into the water, which flooded\r\nall the cabin and companion-way.  If stunned by the fall, or\r\nstupefied by the rum of which he had partaken so freely, he might lie\r\nthere and drown.\r\n\r\nBut what was the fate of such a wretch to me?  If I returned on\r\nboard, could I save him?  No; it was more than probable that in his\r\nintoxication he would assail me, and I might perish by his hand; so\r\nleaving the Cubano to his fate, I continued my ascent, until I\r\nreached the banana thicket, where my little hiding-place lay.  There\r\nI placed the sword I had found beside me for security, and coiling\r\nmyself up on my bed of dry leaves, strove to sleep, and dream of\r\ndeliverance and of home.  But the idea of Antonio perishing there in\r\nthe wreck haunted me, and kept me long miserable and awake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD SPANISH BOOK.\r\n\r\nNext morning my doubts about Antonio were dispelled, when, from my\r\nplace of concealment (which was on the brow of a wooded rock), I\r\nheard him shouting for me; and once or twice I obtained a glimpse of\r\nhim, stumbling about as if intoxicated, with the box of case-bottles\r\nslung over his back in a Manilla rope.\r\n\r\nHow he had got either the box or himself ashore was a mystery, the\r\npassage along the reef, and the ascent from thence to the upper part\r\nof the island being so difficult and so dangerous; but heedless of\r\nhis invitations to join him, and of his threats for absenting myself,\r\nI remained close in my place of concealment, being well aware that if\r\nthe Cubano was a hateful and perilous companion when sober, he would\r\nbe doubly so in his present state.\r\n\r\nThe morning was clear and bright in all its tropical loveliness.  My\r\nfirst glance was turned to the sea, where its waters blended in the\r\nfaintest blue with the flat horizon; but no sail was in sight.\r\n\r\nSo long had this been the case--so often had I swept the sea at\r\nsunrise and at sunset with haggard eyes in vain,--that I repressed\r\nthe usual sigh; and placing the book I had found open in the\r\nsunshine, that its damp leaves might dry, I selected a ripe banana,\r\nbrought some water in a large leaf from a spring, and proceeded to\r\nmake my breakfast like a hermit of old.\r\n\r\nConcealed by thick shrubs and beds of gigantic tulips, I was certain\r\nthat Antonio could neither discover nor molest me--at least, that he\r\ncould not take me by surprise, which was somewhat consoling; for the\r\nevents of yesterday morning had given me a greater terror of him.\r\n\r\nAt my feet apparently lay the bay, on the margin of which stood the\r\nrude wigwam built by the men of the _Eugenie_; and it made me think\r\nsadly of good Marc Hislop and others who were gone.\r\n\r\nThere lay the rocks which formed the horns of that beautiful bay,\r\ntufted with feathery trees, and between them extended the long white\r\nline of the coral reef, over which the shadowy vessel had appeared to\r\nsail on that eventful night.\r\n\r\nOn my right towered through the clouds the great mountain, which is\r\nyet unnamed; and on my left rose, sheer from the water, the mighty\r\nbluff we had first descried at sea.\r\n\r\nI took up the book, the leaves of which the warm sunshine had dried\r\nand crisped, and its pages made me think of home and of that\r\ncivilization from which I was exiled--of Eton and other times; and\r\nfor nearly an hour my eyes were full, my heart sick and heavy, with\r\nintense longing for relief, and a weariness of the life I was passing\r\non this lonely island.\r\n\r\nAfter a time I began to read, and in this new or old (it was both to\r\nme) sense of pleasure, I forgot all my sorrow and peril.\r\n\r\nIt was a Spanish book, the title-page of which was gone, but proved\r\nto be the first volume of a collection of the voyages and discoveries\r\nmade by the Spaniards in the olden time.\r\n\r\nIt related* the adventures of Alphonso de Albuquerque, detailing how\r\nhe and Tristan da Cunha, each with seven caravels, had sailed from\r\nEurope and touched at Teneriffe, while there was an eruption from the\r\ncrater of the great peak, during which a mighty mass of rock fell\r\ndown, and brought to light the great diamond, which had since shone\r\nat times with such wondrous brilliance in the night, but the exact\r\nlocality of which baffled all search during day.\r\n\r\n\r\n* I subsequently learned from Marc Hislop that the work was probably\r\na volume of the _Collection de los Viages y Descubrimientos de los\r\nEspanoles en Indias_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSailing from thence to the isles named Tristan da Cunha, a storm\r\ndispersed the fleet; but Alphonso, after being separated from Don\r\nTristan discovered the island, which he named from himself, and had\r\nhis name cut on one of the rocks, in the year in which Philip, King\r\nof Castile and Emperor of Austria, died; and this was the rock which\r\nwe had discovered.\r\n\r\nThen, in the following year, he sailed to India, of which he became\r\nviceroy, for Ferdinand the Catholic.  It detailed how, thereafter, he\r\nwent from the city of Cochin unto the Straits of Malacca, and sent a\r\ncertain valiant Portuguese knight, named Ruy Nunnez da Cunha, as\r\nambassador to the king of the Seguiers: how he sailed to Java, where\r\nhe found the wonderful birds of paradise, that came in flights from\r\nthe southern isles of India, and were fabled to be always on the wing\r\nwithout the power of alighting, till they found some that were drunk\r\nwith the strength of the nutmeg, which always intoxicates them.\r\n\r\nIn that sea huge lampreys adhered to the keels of his caravels, and\r\nfor a time retarded their progress, which was deemed to be\r\nenchantment.\r\n\r\nSailing thence, Alphonso discovered an island where the sea-serpent\r\ncoiled up his monstrous length for certain seasons, guarding caverns\r\nthat were filled with piles of golden ingots, and casks of orient\r\npearls, rubies, and diamonds; and in this isle were deep bights and\r\nbays, where ships with all their crews lay spell-bound by\r\nnecromancers.\r\n\r\nOn another island he found a white nation, whose cavaliers were\r\narrayed in fine shirts, slashed doublets of taffeta, and trunk hose,\r\nwith long swords and short mantles, exactly like the Portuguese; and\r\nhaving money of silver, with many other incredible statements, all\r\ntending to assure the reader that this settlement was one of the\r\nseven Christian colonies that, under seven bishops, had fled from the\r\nSpanish Peninsula when the cross was trampled under the feet of the\r\nMoors, and when the churches of Christ were converted into mosques\r\nfor the worship of Mohammed, as a punishment for the wickedness of\r\nRoderick the Last of the Goths.\r\n\r\nReturning westward from this wonderful voyage, in 1513, Don Alphonso\r\nwent from the city of Goa to the straits of Mecca, and passing with\r\ntwenty caravels through the narrow Gate of Tears into the Red Sea, he\r\nbombarded the city of Aden, after which a cross appeared in heaven,\r\nshining before his ship, like the pillar of fire that shone before\r\nthe children of Israel; and two years after, this worthy cavalier,\r\njust as he was about to make Shah Ishmael, king of Persia, pay\r\ntribute to his master the king of Castile, \"passed away to the\r\ncompany of the saints,\" dying like a true Hidalgo, with his armor on,\r\nand his toledo at his girdle.\r\n\r\nThe real and the marvellous were so curiously blended in these\r\nvoyages, that I read on, forgetful of all about me, and charmed in\r\nspite of my deplorable situation.\r\n\r\nAt last I came to the history of a valiant mariner who invented a\r\n_steamship_ in the time of Charles V.--a narrative which seemed to\r\nillustrate the old aphorism, that there is nothing new under the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen Charles the First of Spain and Fifth of Germany was emperor,\r\nthere lived in the busy town of Barcelona, a certain Blasco de Garay,\r\ncaptain of a merchant ship.\r\n\r\nIn his youth, Blasco had been one of the mariners of Columbus, whom\r\nhe accompanied in all those voyages which gave to Castile and Leon a\r\nnew realm beyond the seas of the southern and western world.  He was\r\nwith him when he landed in Guana Bay, and erected the standard of\r\nFerdinand and Isabella on a shore never before trod by a Christian\r\nfoot; so this land, which is one of the Bahamas, by the suggestion of\r\nBlasco, he named San Salvador; and he was also with him at the\r\ndiscovery of Cuba, of Hispaniola, and the discovery of that mighty\r\ncontinent, the nominal honor of which was robbed from Columbus, by\r\nAmerigo Vespucius, the Florentine.\r\n\r\nBut all this was when Blasco was a boy; so fifty-one years after,\r\nthat is, in the year of grace 1543, he conceived the idea \"of an\r\nengine able to move large vessels in calm weather without the use of\r\noars or sails.\"\r\n\r\nSo coldly were his proposals met at home, that he was on the point of\r\napplying to James V. of Scotland, a monarch then far in advance of\r\nany other in Europe, in the cultivation of the arts, of commerce,\r\nmusic, architecture, and painting; but unfortunately he died of a\r\nbroken heart, and, moreover, his mariners were the scourge of the\r\nshores of Portugal and Spain.\r\n\r\nBut Blasco did not lose heart, for after enduring torrents of\r\nridicule, and experiencing incredible abuse, with threats from the\r\nDominicans that they would burn him as a sorcerer, the Emperor agreed\r\nto permit a trial of his great invention, and it took place in\r\npresence of a mighty concourse, at Barcelona, on the 17th of June,\r\n1543.\r\n\r\nThe harbor there is formed by a kind of bight, which lies between the\r\ncitadel of Monjuich and the city; all the shore of this bay was\r\ncovered with spectators; the battlements of the governor's palace,\r\nand those of the palaces of the counts of Barcelona and of the kings\r\nof Arragon, with the spire of St. Mary-of-the-Sea, were also covered\r\nby a multitude.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was on horseback, surrounded by his courtiers, the\r\ncommanders of St. Jago of Calatrava, of Alcantara, and other\r\nreligious and military orders, wearing their crosses and mantles, and\r\nall the officials of his splendid household, while his guard of\r\narchers, the guards of Monteros de Espinosa, and the old German\r\nLanzknechts, lined the beach with their great gilded partisans, the\r\nstaves of which were covered with crimson velvet and tasselled with\r\ngold.\r\n\r\nOn beholding all these preparations, and such a concourse of the\r\nnoble, the wealthy, and great around the Emperor, Blasco de Garay\r\nbelieved that the fortunate hour--\"the hour which, according to the\r\ngeneral saying, presents itself to every man _once_ in his life for\r\nmaking fame and fortune,\" had now arrived.\r\n\r\nHe had spent the night in prayer, at Montserrat, for the success of\r\nhis invention--dreamt of in youth, studied in manhood, and now\r\nmatured in age--the ship that would be alike independent of wave and\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nMontserrat is a few miles from Barcelona, and had then a famous\r\nabbey, which was much frequented in consequence of a miraculous image\r\nof the Virgin, which was kept in a chapel on the summit of a rock;\r\nand in this chapel ninety lamps of solid silver, filled with perfumed\r\noil, burned night and day, and on each was engraved the name and arms\r\nof Alphonso de Albuquerque, who brought them from the mosques of the\r\nEast, beyond the realms of Prester John.  In the caverns beneath\r\ndwelt many aged hermits and others who wished to seclude themselves\r\nfrom the world; so there did Blasco de Garay spend the night\r\npreceding the 17th of June, in meditation and prayer for the success\r\nof his wonderful scheme.\r\n\r\nA vessel of two hundred tons, named _La Trinidad_, commanded by\r\nCaptain Pedro de Scarza, was then passing the high bar which is\r\nformed at the entrance of the bay by the waters of the Bezos, and the\r\nLlobregat mingling with the sea; and when she caught the eye of the\r\nEmperor, he ordered Blasco to try his experiment on _her_.\r\n\r\nShe was laden with corn, and had just come from Monte Colibre or the\r\nColumbretes islets, which lie near the coast of Valencia, and poor\r\nPedro de Scarza, in his ignorance and fear of what was about to be\r\ndone to his ship, rent his beard and tore his slashed doublet as he\r\nstamped about her deck and gave himself up for lost, when ordered to\r\nfurl every thing aloft as _La Trinidad_ was to sail without canvas,\r\nor as he believed, about to be bewitched.\r\n\r\nBlasco told his secret to none; but it was observed that he placed\r\nacross the vessel's deck, and bolted thereto an axle, at each end of\r\nwhich was a large wooden wheel.  Amidships were several other\r\nmysterious wheels with bands and bars, and a necromantic-looking iron\r\nboiler of great size, which he filled, however, with water from the\r\nholy well of Montserrat.\r\n\r\nThe moment this water attained boiling heat, by means of a fire which\r\nburned in a grating underneath, the wheels revolved, and again Pedro\r\nde Scarza rent his beard, while most of his crew jumped overboard;\r\nfor now the vessel ran right across the Bay of Barcelona _against_\r\nthe wind which was blowing fresh, to the great astonishment and\r\nterror of the people.\r\n\r\nCharles V., whose mind was more occupied by wars and conquests, by\r\nbattles and sieges, than the arts of science and peace, ordered his\r\ntreasurer to inspect this strange machine and report upon it.\r\n\r\nThe treasurer, in doing so, got his trunk breeches torn by a portion\r\nof the machinery, by which accident about three pecks (Spanish) of\r\nfine cedar sawdust, which formed the bombasting thereof, were spilled\r\non the deck of _La Trinidad_; so being a solemn, proud, and pompous\r\ngrandee of Old Castile, he justly considered himself insulted by a\r\nvile mechanical contrivance, which he loudly denounced, stating \"that\r\nit was not worth adopting, as the vessel did not go more than eight\r\nmiles in two hours, which any caravel might do; and that the boiler\r\nwas a Satanic affair, which was liable to burst and scald good\r\nChristians.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, who was on the eve of departing from Spain to invade\r\nFrance, thus forbade Blasco to think more of his invention; but he\r\nbestowed upon him forty thousand maravedis, and created him a knight\r\nof the Dove of Castile--an order instituted in 1379, by Henry II.,\r\nKing of Castile and Lord of Biscay--the same who was poisoned by a\r\nhandsome pair of buskins sent to him by Mohammed II., the Red-faced\r\nking of Granada.\r\n\r\nBut Blasco de Garay, on seeing no further hope of success with his\r\nlong-cherished steam engine, in the bitterness of his heart dashed it\r\nto pieces with a hammer, thus destroying in an instant all that the\r\nfond hopes, the deep thoughts, and the labor of a lifetime had\r\ndeveloped and constructed.\r\n\r\nDisgusted with the world and weary of it, he retired to one of the\r\nlittle hermitages in the Rock of Montserrat, only in time to prevent\r\nthe Inquisition from burning him as a sorcerer, and there he died, in\r\nthe year of the Emperor's abdication, 1555.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nSANGRE POR SANGRE.\r\n\r\nSeated under a banana tree, with my back resting against its trunk, I\r\nhad read thus far; and lulled by the ceaseless hum of insects among\r\nthe leaves, and by the equally monotonous chafing of the sea on the\r\nbeach far down below, I permitted the book, so valuable under the\r\ncircumstances in which I was placed, to drop from my hands, and I was\r\nabout to sleep, when the appearance of a distant object on the waters\r\ngave me a species of electric shock.\r\n\r\nA SHIP!\r\n\r\nUnder a cloud of canvas, she was running direct for the island from\r\nthe west, and must have been some hours visible before she caught my\r\neye.\r\n\r\nI started up as if I would have met her half way, and then seated\r\nmyself again, and watched her in a species of ecstasy.\r\n\r\nAh! how my heart leaped at this sight!   My emotions were\r\nsuffocating, and with them there was a nervous fear that it might\r\nprove another optical delusion--another Fata Morgana--another ship\r\nthat would melt away on a nearer approach.\r\n\r\nBut no!  On she came--on and on, with the white foam curling under\r\nher sharp bows, a long wake weltering under the counter, and running\r\nfar astern, every thing set upon her that would draw, from deck to\r\ntrucks; even her studding-sails were rigged out from the lower, the\r\ntopsail, and top-gallant yards.\r\n\r\nShe seemed a very large vessel, ship-rigged, and apparently about\r\nfifteen miles distant.\r\n\r\nHow I dreaded that she might change her course!  How I longed for\r\nsome means of attracting her, ere evening came on.  How I panted.  I\r\nrose, and in an incredibly short space reached the summit of the\r\ngreat bluff which overhangs the sea.\r\n\r\nThere, under a blazing sun, I exhausted myself by waving my tattered\r\njacket, and by shouting as if her crew could have heard me.\r\n\r\nThen I felt my brain almost boiling in the heat, and sat down in the\r\nshade of a thicket to fan myself with a large leaf, and lave water\r\nfrom a spring upon my face and head.\r\n\r\nForgetting all about Antonio, or what his views or purposes might now\r\nbe, I descended to the beach, and stood upon the white stripe of\r\nsand, in the hope that some one on board who might be using a\r\ntelescope would distinguish me; and about two hours after she came in\r\nsight, I supposed this was the case, for when the wind veered more\r\nupon her quarter, I saw her ensign floating as it was run up to the\r\ngaff peak; but my eyes failed to make out its color or nation.\r\n\r\nAnd now her hull became black and all her canvas assumed a purple hue\r\nas the sun set; but her sails grew white again when the shadow of the\r\nmountain fell across the sea she sailed on.\r\n\r\nShe was about three miles off, when the wind became light, and ere\r\nlong almost died away.  I felt as if bursting with impatience--with\r\nexcited hope, with joy to behold her, and with desire for\r\ndeliverance.  All this created a delirium in my head and heart, like\r\nintoxication or fever.\r\n\r\nDuring the day, I had seen nothing of Antonio, whom I supposed to be\r\neither on board the wreck, or employed with his beloved case of\r\nJamaica rum in some thicket on the other side of the island.  Indeed\r\nI forgot all about him, and thought only of the approaching ship.\r\n\r\nI felt certain that I had been seen; why else would she have shown\r\nher colors?\r\n\r\nThe sunset was followed by a deep and solemn crimson, which\r\noverspread the western quarter of the sky and sea.  The line of the\r\nhorizon could no longer be distinguished, so softly did cloud and\r\nwater blend together in the distance.\r\n\r\nIn the dark blue vault above, the diamond stars were sparkling.  No\r\nsound met the ear but the gurgle of a spring from a rock plashing on\r\nthe pebbled channel, and the ceaseless chafing of the sea upon the\r\nlonely shore.\r\n\r\nThe passing breeze stirred the pendent leaves of the palms, and then\r\ndied away, for it came in puffs that caused the canvas of the coming\r\nship to shiver aloft; so ere long her courses were brailed up, as\r\nthey collapsed against the masts.\r\n\r\nSlowly and imperceptibly the large and stately craft came on.  There\r\nwas a trim squareness in her hamper aloft, and a clean, flush run in\r\nher hull that gave her somewhat the aspect of a man-o'-war; but she\r\nwas not one, evidently.\r\n\r\nNearer and nearer she came.  The look-out ahead evidently saw the bar\r\nor coral reef, with the ridge of white foam that boiled at the\r\nentrance of the bay, for now a leadsman was busy in the forechains to\r\nleeward.\r\n\r\nAnon her cloud of canvas, topsails, topgallantsails, and royals,\r\nseemed to tower between me and the sky.  I could see every sail and\r\nrope distinctly, and could count the men upon her deck.\r\n\r\nNow her royals were hauled down, and the fore-yards slewed round as\r\nher head was thrown in the wind; then the rushing sound of the great\r\nchain cable, as it roared hoarsely through the iron hawse-pipe,\r\nreached my ear over the ripples within the bay, as she came to anchor\r\noutside the reef; and I saw her crew swarming up aloft, and laying\r\nout upon the yards to hand her canvas, and in a few minutes she was\r\nbared of every thing.\r\n\r\nI panted with eagerness for the next movement in the drama of my\r\ndeliverance, and laughed exultingly when one of her quarter boats was\r\nlowered and manned.\r\n\r\nFor a time, it hung off the larboard quarter, as the great ship swung\r\nround at her moorings, and the bow-man held on to the mizzen channels\r\nby a boat-hook, while the men kept their oars up-ended.\r\n\r\nDuring this delay, I endured an agony of impatience.  At last a smart\r\nfellow slid down the falls to the stern sheets, seated himself,\r\nseized the tiller rope, and the oars dipped in the water as she was\r\nshoved off with her bow pointed to the shore.\r\n\r\nThey were pulling for a part of the beach where a ledge of rock\r\nformed a kind of natural pier within the northern horn of the bay,\r\nand I was about to run in that direction, when the voice of Antonio,\r\nrendered husky by his recent potations, reached me.\r\n\r\n\"Hola!  Stop, or it may be the worse for you,\" said he.\r\n\r\nI turned, and saw him start from behind some large boulders which lay\r\non the beach to my right.  There he had evidently been lurking and\r\nobserving the ship's approach; and now he stood, with bare knife in\r\nhand, between me and the coming boat.\r\n\r\nThe pile of weedy boulders concealed us both at that moment from the\r\nship, and from those in her boat; and by the light of the moon, I\r\ncould read the fell intention of Antonio in his dark and deep-set eye.\r\n\r\nIn tangled masses, his black hair fell over a low and narrow brow,\r\nand met the equally black whiskers that mingled with the beard which\r\ngrew like a furze-bush over his chin and cheeks.  Naked to the waist,\r\nhe resembled in every way a brawny savage.  Inflamed by alcohol, the\r\nexpression of his eye was terrible, and he seemed to tremble with the\r\nferocity of his emotions, as he grasped his knife, with the thumb of\r\nhis right hand placed firmly over the pommel.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight shone brightly on the beach; so whatever he meant to\r\ndo, he resolved should be done behind the screen formed by the\r\nboulders among which he had been concealed.\r\n\r\nI had still the sword which had been taken from the wreck, and I drew\r\nit with the resolution of defending my life to the last.  Antonio\r\nstarted on beholding me armed so unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n\"You see the boat which is making for the shore?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"I do, and am on my way to meet it; so stand aside, Cubano,\" I\r\nreplied, firmly.\r\n\r\n\"And you will tell her crew of all that happened in the _Eugenie_,\r\nand cry _sangre por sangre_!\" said he, grinding his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"That is as may be,\" said I, without consideration.\r\n\r\nThen uttering a howl like a wild animal, he rushed upon me with his\r\nknife uplifted; but quite undaunted I met him half-way, and thrust\r\nthe sword under his right arm-pit.  Springing back, before the great\r\nlumbering ruffian could renew the attack, I gave him another\r\ndangerous wound in the breast, which tumbled him down on his face;\r\nand without looking to see whether or not he moved again, I ran along\r\nthe moonlit beach, and reached the boat, which had just sheered\r\nalongside the ledge of rock already mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nTHE SAN ILDEFONSO.\r\n\r\nThe bowman held the boat's-head to the shore by the hook, which he\r\ngrasped with his left hand, while stretching out his right to me.\r\n'Twas old Tom Lambourne; there was no mistaking that quaint and\r\ntattooed visage of his!\r\n\r\n\"Hilloah, Master Rodney, here we are again, come back for you, after\r\nall;\" he exclaimed, joyfully.\r\n\r\n\"Tom, Tom!\" I gasped, while seizing his hard brown hand, and leaping\r\nwithout invitation, into the boat, where my hands were immediately\r\ngrasped by Hislop, who had been steering.  \"Oh, Hislop, Marc Hislop!\"\r\nI added, in a breathless voice, and nearly sank down overcome by\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't think _I_ would leave you there, my boy, if I could help\r\nit?\" said he.  \"Thank heaven, we have come in time.  I have counted\r\nevery day, every hour, aye, every moment, and have scarcely ever\r\nslept for thinking of you, and the wretched condition in which you\r\nwere left.\"\r\n\r\nI could not reply, but, completely overcome by the revulsion of\r\nfeeling, seated myself in the stern-sheets, and wept.\r\n\r\n\"What is this in your hand?\" said Hislop, with astonishment; \"a\r\nsword, and blood on it too!  Where did it,--where did this come from?\"\r\n\r\n\"Antonio,\"--I began.\r\n\r\n\"The villanous Cubano?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" my voice sank into a whisper, I was so weak.\r\n\r\n\"What of him?--where is he?\"\r\n\r\n\"He tried to kill me when he saw the boat approaching, and--and--\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"I ran him through the body.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is he now?\" continued Hislop.  \"Our work in rescuing you\r\nwill be but half done if we leave him unhanged.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is lying wounded, dying, perhaps, on the beach.  Oh, Hislop, it\r\nis horrible!  For pity's sake, for heaven's sake, go some of\r\nyou--behind those rocks,\" I added, incoherently, for in my joy at\r\nescaping, I felt it possible even to compassionate and forgive\r\nAntonio.\r\n\r\n\"Remain here,\" said Hislop, and leaping ashore, followed by Tom\r\nLambourne, he went at once to the place I indicated.\r\n\r\nI now looked at the boat's crew, eight in number and to my surprise\r\nfound they were all Spaniards; bearded, mustachioed, and armed with\r\nsheath-knives in their sashes; some wore red nets on their heads,\r\nothers red night-caps, and they might all have passed--especially\r\nthose with earrings--for blood relations of the Cubano.\r\n\r\nI had scarcely made this unpleasant discovery when Hislop and\r\nLambourne appeared, half supporting and half dragging Antonio toward\r\nthe boat, into the bow of which they thrust him with very little\r\nceremony; and there he lay in a heap, as it were, with his eyes\r\nclosed and his bare and hairy chest covered with blood and sand.\r\n\r\nHis right hand still clenched his Albacete* knife, the weapon with\r\nwhich he had committed so many crimes; so Hislop tore it from him,\r\nand cast it into the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Albacete is a town of Murcia, where the cutlers manufacture a great\r\nnumber of sheath-knives.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe moaned heavily, and the Spanish oarsmen looked at each other, and\r\nthen at me, with eyes the reverse of friendly in expression; but now\r\nHislop seated himself, assumed the tiller-lines, and said, in their\r\nown language,--\r\n\r\n\"Shove off for the ship, marineros.  We must have the wounds of this\r\npicaro looked to at once; so give way with a will.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat's head fell round, her stern lay to the beach of that\r\ndetested island of Alphonso, and the sturdy _Espanoles_, with their\r\nbare feet planted firmly on the stretchers, bent their backs at every\r\nstroke, and made the boat fly through the moon-lit bay, toward the\r\nship, which lay more than a mile distant outside the coral reef.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes I related to Hislop, how my time had been spent\r\nsince his departure, and how I had feared that the desperate sequel\r\nof to-night would assuredly ensue when Antonio found a ship off the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\"He will dangle from the yard-arm now, if ever a rascally pirate\r\nswung there!\" said Hislop, through his clenched teeth.\r\n\r\nAfter my loneliness on the island, I cannot describe how pleasant his\r\nvoice--the voice of a valued and trusted friend--sounded in my ear!\r\n\r\nHe told me that the boat's crew soon repented of their selfishness\r\nand folly in leaving the island, and next day would have returned,\r\nbut they had lost all idea of its bearings, and being without compass\r\nor chart, were compelled to run in what they believed to be the\r\ndirection of Tristan da Cunha.\r\n\r\nA sea half swamped the boat, and washing away the tarpaulin which\r\ncovered the bread-bags, soaked and destroyed their contents; yet,\r\nhaving no other food, they were compelled to eat these salt-sodden\r\nbiscuits, and thus their thirst became excited to agony, as they were\r\nunder a vertical sun, and their supply of fresh water was rapidly\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\nFor six days and nights they endured unspeakable misery; and just\r\nwhen they were sucking the last putrid drops from the barrel-staves,\r\na large vessel hove in sight, running due west, under a cloud of\r\ncanvas.  She saw their signal, bore down, and picked them up.\r\n\r\nShe proved to be the _San Ildefonso_, a Spanish merchant-ship of\r\nsixteen hundred tons, bound from Java to Cadiz, with a mixed crew of\r\nSpaniards and Lascars, and with a few cabin passengers; in all about\r\nsixty souls.\r\n\r\nHer skipper, the Captain José Estremera was very unwilling to add to\r\nthe number of his crew, lest provisions should run short, and flatly\r\nrefused at first to haul up for the island, and take me off.\r\n\r\nFor two days he resisted all the entreaties of Hislop and others,\r\ntill the former found one ally in a Portuguese friar, who was\r\nreturning from his mission in Java, and another in a wealthy Dutch\r\npassenger.\r\n\r\nFra Anselmo held the terrors of Pandemonium before the capitano, and\r\nthe Dutch planter held a handful of guilders, so the yards were\r\ntrimmed anew, the charts were consulted carefully, and in two days\r\nmore the look-out man in the fore-cross-trees of the _San Ildefonso_\r\nsighted the great mountain of the island.\r\n\r\nHislop had many doubts whether he would find me alive, fearing that I\r\nmight perish of hunger, of despair, or by the hand of the Cubano.\r\n\r\nJust as he concluded his narrative, I found myself under the towering\r\nside of the Spanish merchant-ship.\r\n\r\nShe had a long flush deck: was pierced for and carried twelve brass\r\nnine-pounders, and had top-gallant bulwarks aft.  Over these and\r\nalong her side was a row of faces, surveying us in the moonlight with\r\nexpressions of wonder and interest.\r\n\r\nI sprang up the rope-ladder, and on reaching the deck my hands were\r\ncaught and shaken by Ned Carlton, old Probart, Burnet the cook, Boy\r\nBill, and others of our crew, who all expressed in various fashions,\r\nbut chiefly by swearing at themselves, their contrition for having so\r\nselfishly abandoned me; but that was all over now, and I desired them\r\nto forget it.\r\n\r\nAntonio was next hoisted on board.  His appearance and his wounds\r\nexcited great astonishment; and now, surrounded by a crowd of dark\r\nand grim-looking Spanish seamen, and darker leathery-visaged Lascars,\r\nwe were conducted aft to the quarter-deck, where Captain José\r\nEstremera awaited us, together with a number of passengers, whose\r\ncuriosity was excited by the whole affair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nWE SAIL FOR EUROPE.\r\n\r\nEstremera was a smart little Andalusian, with large whiskers, which\r\nhe curled with great care, and he wore his black hair shorn short.\r\nHe had little gold rings in his ears, and the red point of a cigarito\r\nperpetually gleamed between his teeth.  He wore a broad-brimmed\r\nstraw-hat, from which a scarlet ribbon floated, and he was entirely\r\nclad in a spotless suit of white linen--jacket, waist-coat, and\r\ntrousers.  The ample collar of a shirt that was broadly striped with\r\nred and white was folded over his shoulders.  He was about to speak,\r\nwhen Antonio, who was supported by two of the crew, suddenly\r\nexclaimed to one of them--\r\n\r\n\"Benito Ojeda--hah!  Don't you remember me, Benito?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, Antonio, is this you?\" replied the seaman; \"the best Cubano\r\nthat ever sailed past the Morro light.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know this man, Benito?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Right well, senor, and will bear witness to his character,\" replied\r\nthe sailor bluntly.\r\n\r\n\"Much value your evidence will be,\" said Estremera, contemptuously,\r\n\"when you are known to be the greatest picaroon on board.  Come,\r\nesta, senor,\" he added to me, \"you are welcome.\"\r\n\r\n\"Muchos gratias, senor capitano,\" replied I, bowing low, as I stepped\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n\"But what in the name of mischief am I to do to provision you all?\"\r\nsaid Estremera, with perplexity.\r\n\r\n\"After what I have endured, senor capitano, a very little food will\r\nsuffice for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Were you ever in Spain?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, senor.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, then----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! one may speak Spanish without having been in Spain,\" said I,\r\nsmiling.\r\n\r\n\"Of course--of course.  But what is this?\" he added, on perceiving\r\nthe wounds of Antonio; \"Caramba! have you been fighting--killing one\r\nanother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Senor,\" said Hislop, \"this is the picaroon of whom I told you--he\r\nwho slew our captain and shipmates, and whom we thrust overboard; but\r\nwho, as if by a miracle, reached the island of Alphonso before us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bueno!  And what more?\"\r\n\r\n\"On seeing your ship come to anchor outside the reef,\" said I, with\r\nsome anxiety for the issue of the affair, \"he endeavored to kill me;\r\nand but for the sword with which I was armed, he had assuredly done\r\nso.\"\r\n\r\n\"To kill you--santos!--and why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lest I should accuse him of those crimes which he had committed in\r\nthe _Eugenie_, and which so many of her surviving crew, now here on\r\nboard, are ready to substantiate.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now in the name of justice, senor capitano, I demand that he be\r\nstrung up at once at the foreyard-arm!\" said Hislop.\r\n\r\n\"Demonio!  I have neither the power nor the will to do that, before\r\nall these accusations have been inquired into and proved; and there\r\nis no chance of our meeting with a Spanish ship of war in these\r\nseas,\" replied the captain.\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which José Estremera scratched his right\r\near with an air of perplexity; and the aspect of Antonio, as he\r\ndrooped between his friend, Benito Ojeda, and another seaman, was\r\ntruly ghastly in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n\"Take that man below, and have his wounds looked to,\" said Captain\r\nEstremera to some of the crew.  \"Senor Hislop, I wish to speak with\r\nyou alone on these matters; and meanwhile, Senor el Gobernador,\" he\r\nadded, to the Dutch gentleman, \"will excuse us.\"\r\n\r\nHe and Marc Hislop now retired aft to the taffrail, over which they\r\nleant and conversed, while the most of the crew went below with\r\nAntonio, who would no doubt give them his version of the story; while\r\nI remained near the binnacle, anxiously waiting the result of this\r\nconference, and watching the changing features of the fertile shore,\r\nthe curved bay, the foam-covered coral reef, and every thicket with\r\nwhich I was so familiar--the palms, the chestnuts, and bananas--as\r\nthe great Spanish merchantman swung slowly round at her anchor, when\r\nthe soft night wind veered from east to south.\r\n\r\nSilence soon reigned fore and aft, for there was none on deck but\r\nsome of the passengers, smoking over the taffrail, the anchor-watch\r\namid ships, and some of the _Eugenie's_ men loitering about the\r\nforecastle-bitts, that they might have an opportunity of speaking\r\nwith me before turning in.\r\n\r\nIt would appear that, being loath to add to the number of his crew,\r\nwho were a mixed and somewhat mutinous band of Spaniards, Cuban\r\nCreoles, and lascars, and having still a long voyage before him, he\r\noffered to rid us of Antonio, and supply us with muskets and\r\nammunition, some medicines and cooking utensils, some old sails and\r\nspars wherewith to erect a comfortable hut, and to leave us all on\r\nthe island of Alphonso, to the chance of being taken off by the next\r\npassing ship, which very possibly might be a British one.\r\n\r\nMy heart died within me on hearing this strange and most unexpected\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\n\"How would you rid us of Antonio, senor?\" asked Hislop, gravely; \"do\r\nyou mean by hanging him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh no!--by taking him with me to Spain.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what purpose?\"\r\n\r\n\"To have him tried before the regidores at Cadiz.\"\r\n\r\n\"While all the witnesses are left behind?\" resumed the Scotchman,\r\nwith surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Demonio--that is true!\" said the captain, scratching his ear again,\r\nfor a partiality to his countryman was evident, and a little use of\r\nthe knife is not deemed a very heinous crime in the land of Don\r\nQuixote.\r\n\r\n\"You can all work?\" said he, in another tone.\r\n\r\n\"All--all can hand, reef, and steer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bueno--one English sailor is worth a dozen Lascars; so if it were\r\nnot for breaking an agreement, I would maroon them all ashore there.\r\nHanging your Cubano might be very useful to terrify some of my crew\r\nwho are very discontented; but I have not the authority to do so--and\r\nthe greater is the pity, as I shall have to feed him, and there is no\r\nuse in feeding up a fellow merely to hang him.  Caramba! there is\r\nnothing for it but keeping you all until we reach Teneriffe;--I shall\r\nbe compelled to run into Palma or Santa Cruz for fresh water, at all\r\nevents; and when there, I shall leave the whole affair in the hands\r\nof Senor, the Captain-General of the Canaries.\"\r\n\r\n\"And meanwhile the Cubano----\"\r\n\r\n\"Shall be put in the bilboes in the cable-tier, as he must be too\r\ndangerous a picaroon to leave afloat among a ship's company like\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\nA berth was prepared for Hislop and me in the steerage, while the\r\nrest of our shipmates were berthed among the Spaniards and dirty\r\nLascars, neither of whom were much to their liking.\r\n\r\nFood and wine were immediately provided for me.  I partook of them\r\ngreedily, and believe that, but for the new strength they gave me, I\r\nshould have sunk altogether.\r\n\r\nOld Tom Lambourne, Ned Carlton, and Probart, the carpenter, now\r\nrejoined me and expressed great discontent that Antonio was not \"run\r\nup at once,\" adding the satisfaction with which they would all have\r\n\"walked aft with the line, had he been at the other end of it,\" and\r\nprophesying evil to the ship and her crew if he was kept aboard.\r\n\r\n\"But what is the captain to do?\" asked Probart; \"'tain't no use\r\nattempting to kill that Cubano--he is either Davy Jones or the Devil!\"\r\n\r\n\"Or Whirlwind Tom, as puts maggots into the midshipmen's nuts,\" said\r\nLambourne, \"and makes a sound ship leak, nobody knows how or why;\r\nsours the burgoo forward and the wine aft; makes many a poor fellow\r\nlose his hold when laying out on the yard-arm in a dark night, and\r\nworks all manner o' mischief aboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he ain't Whirlwind Tom, out and out,\" added Probart, solemnly,\r\nand with increasing energy, as if by describing their own fears they\r\nwished to apologize for their desertion of me, \"if he ain't Whirlwind\r\nTom, I say he's something as bad, and I wish I was clear o' this here\r\ncraft, before he works us all a mischief.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he's the ghost of some old buccaneer that's been hung at\r\nPort Royal, or marooned on the Albuquerque Keys long ago,\" said\r\nLambourne.  \"He has already found an old shipmate aboard, and may I\r\nnever see the Nore again if they won't be up to something sly before\r\nlong: for that fellow has sin enough on his soul to sink a\r\nseventy-four!\"\r\n\r\nThe _San Ildefonso_ was a beautiful ship, and very man-o'-war-like in\r\nher general aspect.\r\n\r\nHer decks were clean and spotless.  Every rope was tidily belayed and\r\ncoiled away in its place, and the brass mountings of her binnacle\r\nlamps, of her wheel and capstan, were all polished till, like the\r\ntwelve brass nines she carried, they shone with the brightness of\r\nburnished gold.\r\n\r\nShe was thoroughly Spanish, though--for all the food on board, even\r\nto the cabin biscuits, had the flavor of garlic; and every thing\r\nelse, even to the red and yellow flag at the gaff peak, was redolent\r\nof Havana cigars.\r\n\r\nHer cargo was valuable, and consisted of the most choice productions\r\nof Java, such as sugar, coffee, pepper, indigo, and tobacco, with\r\nspices of all kinds.\r\n\r\nAmong her cabin passengers she had the Dutch Governor of Surabaya, a\r\nprovince of Java, which is bounded on the north by the sea of that\r\nname, and on the east by the Straits of Madura.  He was a retired\r\nsoldier, and latterly had been a planter, and was now returning home\r\nto Holland with a vast quantity of luggage, in which, as Hislop\r\ninformed me, according to the rumor current about the forecastle, an\r\nalmost fabulous amount of guilders was packed in canvas bags.\r\n\r\n\"And with a crew so mixed as ours,\" he added, \"it is the reverse of\r\npleasant to have such constant whispering about it, when we have to\r\nrun along the wildest portion of the west coast of Africa.\"\r\n\r\nFor three days the _San Ildefonso_ remained at anchor a few fathoms\r\noff the reef, while her crew took every thing of value from the\r\nwaterlogged brig that lay on the western shore.\r\n\r\nHer iron cables and remaining anchor, her copper bolts, and a log or\r\ntwo of mahogany, with some coils of Manilla rope, were brought on\r\nboard.  The poor fellow whose bones were hanging at the fore-channel,\r\nfound a Christian grave, for he was buried near the rock which had\r\nthe Spanish legend carved on it; and there Fra Anselmo, the\r\nPortuguese missionary, performed the funeral services of his church;\r\nand solemnly for the unknown dead, the prayer seemed to go up to\r\nHeaven from that lonely islet in the South Atlantic.\r\n\r\nThen, to my joy, the boats were hoisted on board,--the topsails were\r\ncast loose, and preparations made for leaving Alphonso.\r\n\r\nThe windlass was manned, and I saw Marc Hislop with the rest,\r\nhandspike in hand, heaving short on the anchor, in his anxiety to get\r\nunder way.\r\n\r\n\"Heave, my lads,--_heave and rally_!\" I heard him shout, as if he had\r\nan English crew under his orders, and wished them to work briskly.\r\n\r\nThe anchor was soon tripped, and the headyards were filled as she\r\npayed off; but too slowly for Hislop's sailor eyes, for he shouted\r\nagain in English, which he was safe to use,--\r\n\r\n\"Sheet home, you lubbers!  Oh, Rodney, how slow these jack-Spaniards\r\nare!  I would rather have one of our own sort than a hundred of them.\r\nNever mind--all's one for that!  I'll have my foot on a deck of good\r\nBritish oak ere long.  Now the canvas fills--she's under way at last,\r\nand walks through the water like a brave and handsome craft as she\r\nis!\"\r\n\r\nNow the island of Alphonso began to recede; the tall trees lessened\r\nto shrubs, the great bluffs to little tufted rocks, while the arms of\r\nthat old familiar bay seemed to close and blend with the shore, as we\r\nbore away to the northward before a fresh, fair southern breeze.\r\n\r\nThough I detested the island and all its features, yet I could not\r\nbut watch them with interest, for it was a shore I should never see\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe evening was lovely, and the blue waves of the ocean rolled in\r\nshining ripples which seemed to flow along with us.\r\n\r\nHislop and I stood on the forecastle leaning over the lee bow, and\r\nwatching the white foam bubbling under her forefoot, as the sharp\r\ncutwater cleft the sea, till the rising spray began to sparkle about\r\nthe catheads; then the brine-dripping anchors were fished up to the\r\ngunwale, and finally hoisted on board.\r\n\r\nFresher came the breeze, and now, as the studding-sail booms were\r\nrigged out to port and starboard, the ship flew through an ocean\r\ncrimsoned by the setting sun, and I heard Hislop, as he sat on the\r\nbowsprit, singing in the lightness of his heart,--\r\n\r\n  Gaily we go o'er the salt blue seas,\r\n    And the waves break white before us;\r\n  Our canvas aloft swells out in the breeze;\r\n    And _home_ points the pennant o'er us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nTHE HOMEWARD VOYAGE.\r\n\r\nMy heart beat happily; I was no longer a lonely maroon, but on the\r\nhigh road to home and Old England.\r\n\r\nWe had several days of the finest tropical weather, and they passed\r\nunmarked by a greater incident than seeing a shoal of dolphins,\r\nsparkling as they surged through the brine; the silvery flying-fish\r\nleap from one green watery slope to another, while the dark crooked\r\nfin of the stealthy shark glided as usual in the trough of the sea\r\nbetween; a piece of weedy drift-wood with Mother Cary's chickens or\r\nalbatrosses floating near it, or perhaps at the horizon, the topsails\r\nof a vessel hull-down, appearing for a time like white or dusky\r\nspecks, according to the position of the sun.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the _San Ildefonso_ perceiving that Marc Hislop and I\r\nwere great friends kindly placed us in the same watch.\r\n\r\nAs for Antonio the Cubano, we never went near him if we could avoid\r\nit.  He was placed in the cable tier, and for more complete security,\r\nin the bilboes, which are iron shackles that confine the feet.\r\nHowever, we daily heard from the surgeon, and from Fra Anselmo, who\r\nwas somewhat skilled in surgery, and who undertook his cure bodily\r\nand mentally, that the wound under the right armpit had proved\r\nslight, though the lung had escaped narrowly, but that the other in\r\nthe breast had penetrated the fleshy portion of the heart, and was a\r\nvery dangerous one.  The friar added, \"that the Cubano was not one of\r\nthose men who are easily killed, and thus he would recover rapidly.\"\r\n\r\nWe also heard that Antonio was well cared for, as he had discovered\r\none or two friends among the crew, such as the seaman Benito Ojeda, a\r\nmost villainous-looking, beetle-browed, and squat little Catalonian,\r\nwho seemed to be the worst character on board, and was engaged in\r\nperpetual quarrels.\r\n\r\n\"As we approach land,\" said the friar, \"it will be necessary to have\r\nboth these fellows well watched.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked Captain Estremera.\r\n\r\n\"Lest they plot an escape or mischief for some of their companeros de\r\nviage.\"\r\n\r\nHislop gave me a quick glance as the old Portuguese padre said this;\r\nfor, of all the persons on board, we had the most reason to dread\r\nthis fettered fiend getting his hands and feet loose again.\r\n\r\nThus, in our berth in the steerage, I was frequently haunted by\r\nvisions of wreck and danger--of sharks opening their jaws to devour\r\nme--of being thrown overboard--of being again marooned on that wild\r\nand lonely island, where no sound of life met the ear, save the\r\nchafing of the waves upon the shore, the hum of insects, and the\r\nrustle of the falling leaves in the solitary woods.\r\n\r\nBut chiefly Antonio was ever before me, like a tormenting spirit or\r\nthe monster-man of \"Frankenstein.\"\r\n\r\nI was ever engaged in fighting with him, or escaping from him; and so\r\nstrong was this idea, that I always kept by my side, at night, the\r\nsword with which I had wounded him when he attempted to cut me off\r\nbefore reaching Hislop's boat.\r\n\r\nThen I would lie awake for hours thinking of the home to which the\r\nship was bearing me, but which I might be fated never to see, and\r\nwatching from my berth the square patch of blue and star-studded sky\r\nthrough the open hatchway, listening the while to the hum of the wind\r\nthrough the mizzen rigging, the pattering of the long rows of\r\nreef-points on the sails, and at times, when looking up, I could see\r\nthe little round trucks that seemed to pierce the starry welkin.\r\nThen, when about to drop asleep, I would start to instant\r\nwakefulness, lest the feet of some one, coming down the ladder close\r\nby, might be those of Antonio--of the assassin escaped from the\r\nbilboes!\r\n\r\nOne evening Hislop and I were in the second dog-watch; we had just\r\nhad our coffee below with the captain, the old Dutch Governor of\r\nSurabaya, Fra Anselmo, and other passengers, and had come on deck as\r\nfour bells struck.\r\n\r\nThere was merely wind enough to keep the canvas full aloft, and not a\r\ncloud was in the sky.  The sea around us had a strange tint like\r\napple green, that paled off into faint blue at the horizon, and the\r\nstately Spanish ship, when the wind came in puffs upon the beam,\r\ncareened gracefully under her cloud of canvas, between us and the\r\nsky, as we walked to and fro aft the mainmast.\r\n\r\nSeated under an awning which was rigged above the topgallant bulwarks\r\naft, the passengers were enjoying their cigars, the men were all in\r\ngroups about the deck forward, knotting, splicing, and conversing.  A\r\ngang of the copper-colored Lascars were squatted on their hams near\r\nthe hawse-hole in the weather bow, all smoking one hubble-bubble,\r\nwhich was made of a large cocoa-nut, and which they passed from one\r\ndingy moustachioed mouth to another in the most free-and-easy way\r\nimaginable.\r\n\r\nEach wore a dirty turban or fez; their blue tunics and brick-red\r\ntrousers were girt at the waist by a tattered sash, in which the\r\ndeadly and double-edged Malay creese was stuck; and this costume gave\r\nthem an aspect as picturesque as the swarthy groups of muscular\r\nSpanish seamen, in their brightly-striped linen shirts, and with\r\ntheir heads furnished with Barcelona handkerchiefs, long scarlet\r\ncaps, or twine nets to confine the masses of their coal-black hair.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a shout forward, and we found that the squat\r\nlittle sailor, Benito Ojeda, when engaged in raising the\r\nforetopmast-staysail out of the bowsprit netting, in which it is\r\nusually stowed, had fallen overboard.  Three sharks, which had been\r\nfollowing the vessel for a week past, would soon have sealed his\r\nfate, but fortunately he caught hold of one of the martingale back\r\nropes, and holding on desperately, swung above the spray that boiled\r\nunder the bows.\r\n\r\nHislop skilfully caught him in the bight of a rope, and he was hauled\r\nin hand over hand, heels foremost, looking alternately as white as a\r\nsheet and as red as a boiled lobster.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you've done the ship much service, Master Hislop, in\r\nfishing that ere customer aboard again,\" said Tom Lambourne, in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Why so, Tom?\" asked the mate.\r\n\r\n\"Because he's the chum of that ugly Cubanny; and a down-headed dog he\r\nis, that is always skulking fore-and-aft when off duty, whispering to\r\none, twisting cigarittys with another, and brewing mischief among the\r\nwhole crew.\"\r\n\r\nHislop looked round at the squat and forbidding little _Espanol_,\r\nwhose head, shoulders, and general bulk were so great that he looked\r\nlike a big man cut off by the knees; but Benito turned sullenly away,\r\nand, without a word of thanks to his preserver, joined a gang who\r\nwere hoisting the flying jib.\r\n\r\nBy the association of ideas, this sail made Hislop and me think of\r\nthe spectral ship we had seen when on the island of Alphonso, and\r\nwhich had so terrified our men.\r\n\r\n\"I have not a doubt,\" said he, \"that it was but the shadow of this\r\nvessel--the _San Ildefonso_--we saw on that night.  The captain\r\npermitted me to examine the ship's log, and I found that at the same\r\nhour she was running upon a wind, and close hauled; that her cabin\r\nlamp was broken by an accident, that the watch on deck had just\r\nshaken out her jib, and by some accident let the jib-sheet fly, and\r\nthat the mate ordered the spanker to be hauled more aft, that she\r\nmight answer her helm better.  Could we have stronger proofs of what\r\nI then asserted, that what we saw was but the dioptrical refraction\r\nof a vessel under canvas elsewhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a startling episode,\" said I, though his meaning was not very\r\nclear to me; \"thus we need not be surprised that foremast-men like\r\nTom Lambourne and others will maintain to the end of their days that\r\nit was the Flying Dutchman they saw, and nothing else!\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely; but according to tradition, Vanderdecken is seldom seen\r\nin these seas,\" replied Hislop, laughing; \"he is always cruising in\r\nTable Bay, or knocking about in the seas off the Cape of Good Hope,\r\nas any old salt will readily tell you.  He may generally be known by\r\nhis carrying a press of sail, royals, sky-scrapers, and every thing,\r\nwhen other craft can scarcely carry steering canvas or double-reefed\r\ncourses; and he always sends off a boat with letters for Amsterdam,\r\naddressed to people who have been in their graves for two hundred\r\nyears or more.  Some of these letters are addressed to William II.,\r\nPrince of Orange (father of our William III.), who died in 1660, and\r\nare offering him five thousand guilders and as many Indian mohurs,\r\npayable at the bank of Amsterdam, if he will grant them a pardon.\"\r\n\r\n\"For what?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Crimes committed on board.  Other letters are addressed by the crew\r\nto their relations, in places that no longer exist, such as the\r\nHaarlem gate and Cinghel-street; and these letters are alike\r\ndangerous to take or refuse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they bring mischief if left on board, and if refused, a\r\ntyphoon comes on and sinks you.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a pleasant craft to be overhauled by, certainly!\"\r\n\r\n\"No one knows the origin of the legend,\" said Hislop; \"some say she\r\nwas a Dutch Indiaman, returning laden with great wealth, when her\r\nvoyage was arrested by dreadful acts of piracy and murder which were\r\ncommitted by her crew.  To punish them, Heaven sent on board a\r\npestilence, which reduced them to a small number of wasted and worn\r\nspectres, who sailed from port to port offering all their ill-gotten\r\ngold as the price of rest, of shelter, of prayers for their sinful\r\nsouls, and burial for their shrunken bodies; but they can never die;\r\nand thus from every haven and harbor, from every shore and town,\r\ntheir dreadful aspect, and the unexplained plague which devoured,\r\nwithout destroying them, even as the vulture preyed upon the vitals\r\nof Prometheus without their being consumed, always procured their\r\nexpulsion, till finding they were shunned by all the world, they were\r\ncompelled at last to cruise off Table Bay, the scene of their crimes,\r\nwhere their spectre ship, always the precursor of a storm, must haunt\r\nthat sea until the day of doom; as Scott has it,--\r\n\r\n  \"----that phantom ship, whose form\r\n  Shoots like a meteor though the storm,\r\n  When the dark scud comes driving hard,\r\n  And lowered is every topsail yard,\r\n  And canvas wove in earthly looms\r\n  No more to brave the storm presumes;\r\n  THEN, 'mid the war of sea and sky,\r\n  Top and top-gallant hoisted high,\r\n  Full spread and crowded every sail,\r\n  The Dæmon Frigate braves the gale;\r\n  And well the doomed spectators know\r\n  The harbinger of wreck and woe!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have often thought,\" continued Hislop, whose memory was singularly\r\nretentive, \"that the story may have originated in the queer old\r\nnautical idea of a _downhill current_, by which any kind of craft\r\nthat doubled Cape Bojadore, on the western coast of Africa, could\r\nnever return; for such was the fixed idea of all mariners prior to\r\nthe voyage of Bartolomeo Diaz, in 1486, and the discovery of the Cape\r\nof Good Hope.  For this downhill current was supposed to run south\r\n_from_ the equator; and hence ships, however close-hauled, might beat\r\nand tack against it in vain; for an adverse wind blew forever in the\r\nsame direction, till their spars rotted, their sails were frittered\r\ninto rags, and their rigging wasted away--till their seams gaped and\r\nopened, and they sank into the sea a worn-out wreck.\"\r\n\r\nWith conversations such as these, combining amusement with\r\ninstruction, this intelligent young sailor was wont to beguile our\r\nwatches, while the _San Ildefonso_ sped on her homeward track.\r\n\r\nWe recrossed the line, and each successive morning I hailed the sun\r\nwith fresh pleasure, as we drew nearer the latitude of Europe; but we\r\ncould still sniff the hot wind that came from the deserts of Africa;\r\nand, ere long, the more experienced eyes on board began to discover\r\nto the eastward a _blink_ in the sky, as that peculiar appearance of\r\nthe atmosphere which indicates the locality of land is named by\r\nseamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nA MUTINY.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time Lambourne made Hislop and me rather uneasy, by\r\nexpressing suspicions of a collusion among the men forward.\r\n\r\nThe whispers of the treasure alleged to be in possession of the old\r\nex-Governor of Surabaya, and the desire of Ojeda and one or two\r\nothers to save Antonio from the punishment that would certainly\r\novertake him, if we reached Teneriffe or signalled a Spanish ship of\r\nwar, formed an unpleasant conjunction of ideas.\r\n\r\nWe, the survivors of the crew of the poor _Eugenie_, knew that if any\r\nrevolt broke out among this mixed gang of dingy rascals, Spaniards,\r\nCreoles, and Lascars, our fate would be sealed.  We were among the\r\nfirst who would assuredly be knocked on the head.\r\n\r\nThere must be great truth in the maxim, that \"no human being ever\r\ncame near another without influencing them for good or for evil.\"\r\n\r\nOn board the _San Ildefonso_ it would seem that Antonio found all the\r\nmaterials for evil ready to his hand, as more than half the crew were\r\nragamuffins \"engaged by the run,\" as the phrase is at sea.  But the\r\nsurmises of Lambourne were much too vague for us to give them any\r\ntangible form as yet; and Antonio, our chief object of dread, was\r\nstill secure in the bilboes in the cable-tier.\r\n\r\nHe had nearly recovered from his wounds.  I saw him only once below,\r\nand, in his impotent wrath, he ground his teeth and spat at me like a\r\nbaited polecat.\r\n\r\nWe saw nothing of the island of St. Mathew, so the next land we\r\nexpected to sight would be the isles off the Cape de Verd; but the\r\nwind continued to blow freshly and steadily from the west, and as\r\nJosé Estremera made no allowance for current-sailing, the setting in\r\nof the sea carried us nearer the coast of Africa than was either\r\nnecessary or desirable.\r\n\r\nThus one evening, we heard the cry of \"_Tierra!_\" from the look-out\r\nman in the crow's nest, and, soon after, a low blue and wavy streak\r\non the lee-bow was declared to be the coast of Africa.\r\n\r\nThough sea and sky were reddened by the setting sun, the rising coast\r\nwore a tint of the deepest indigo.  It seemed rather flat and low;\r\nbut, as we crept in shore, its features changed and became more\r\nbroken.  Thickets of strange trees were discernible along the\r\nsea-margin, and then mountains rose in the distant background, with\r\nthe sunset lingering in gold on their summits.\r\n\r\nNight fell, and the ship's head was kept away a few points more to\r\nthe west; and when day broke we were all on deck betimes to greet the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nWe found the ship off Poison Island, which lies far northward of\r\nSierra Leone, and adjoins the territory of the Felletahs.  Many of\r\nthe natives came off in their carved and painted canoes (which were\r\npropelled by paddles shaped like shovels), offering fruit,\r\nvegetables, and bananas for sale; and these Africans would\r\ncourageously shoot their light boats right across the forefoot of the\r\nship while still under way.\r\n\r\nAt last the mainyard was backed for a few minutes, while José\r\nEstremera bought the entire contents of a large canoe for a few empty\r\nbottles, some iron rings, and the links of an old chain.\r\n\r\nSome of these craft were rowed by Felletah women, and I could\r\nperceive that though deeply tanned by the sun, their faces were\r\npleasant and oval, their noses aquiline, and their hair black and\r\nglossy.\r\n\r\nAll these tawny rowers wore striped cloth tunics, which reached to\r\ntheir ankles, and had their necks and arms loaded with beads of glass\r\nor coral, and many of them had Spanish dollars attached to their\r\near-rings.\r\n\r\nA gun was fired as a warning for all boats to keep off, lest some\r\naccident might ensue; and it was amusing to see the consternation of\r\nthe poor Felletahs, and with what speed they paddled away toward the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nOrders were now issued to lay the ship's head nearer the wind for the\r\nCape de Verd, and to bend the cable to the working anchor, that it\r\nmight be ready for any emergency; and these directions had the\r\nunexpected effect of bringing matters to a crisis between our captain\r\nand the friends of Antonio.\r\n\r\nThey assembled in sullen groups about the deck, and clustered out\r\nupon the booms, where they muttered and whispered, and frequently\r\npointed to the shore and to the native boats that were paddling into\r\nthe sandy coves and wooded creeks.\r\n\r\nTom Lambourne, whom Captain Estremera soon discovered to be one of\r\nthe best seamen on board, had gone below, with one or two more, to\r\nrouse the cable out of the tier, when, to his surprise, he found the\r\nplace filled with Spanish sailors and Lascars, all talking at once,\r\nand in full conference with the fettered Cubana!\r\n\r\nHe was roughly ordered to sheer off and let the cable lie, while one\r\nor two drew their knives in a threatening manner.\r\n\r\n\"They are up to something at last!\" said he to Carlton; \"so it is\r\nhigh time for the captain and his cabin passengers to look out for a\r\nsquall, or that old Dutchman's dollars may change hands at the\r\ncapstan-head before night.\"\r\n\r\nHislop and I had dined with the captain, and were lingering over some\r\nwine of Alicant, fruit, and cigars, listening to a dispute about some\r\nvery irrelevant matter between the old Governor of Surabaya and Fra\r\nAnselmo, when the ship's steward came to say that a sailor wished to\r\nspeak with us in haste.\r\n\r\nTom was admitted, and bluntly stated at once his conviction that a\r\nplot had been laid by Antonio and others to seize the ship and run\r\nher ashore.  If such were not their intentions, why had they refused\r\nto let him bend the cable to the working-anchor?\r\n\r\nHislop hurriedly repeated Tom's statement in Spanish, adding thereto\r\nhis own ideas and suspicions on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe old priest and the rich Dutchman became seriously alarmed; while\r\nthe olive visage of Captain Estremera grew dark as night with anger.\r\n\r\n\"Ave Maria!\" said the priest, closing his snuffbox, and putting it\r\nhastily in his pocket.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Dutch Governor started up to look for his sword.\r\n\r\n\"Seize my ship!--A mutiny!--What can their object be?\" stammered the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"With some,\" replied Hislop, \"merely to have a buccaneering ramble\r\nashore among the Felletahs--with others, to marry and settle for a\r\ntime; but with all, to have a scene of plunder and devastation, to\r\naid in the escape of Antonio, and to murder his English shipmates.\"\r\n\r\nAt first the captain was inclined to doubt the whole affair; but a\r\nstrange noise was now heard in the forepart of the ship, and Manuel\r\nGautier, the chief mate, came hurriedly down to report that some of\r\nthe men had taken the iron balls from the shot-rack at the\r\nmain-hatchway, and were rolling them about the deck; and that, when\r\nhe remonstrated with Benito Ojedo, there was a rush made aft, with\r\ncries of \"Throw him overboard!\"\r\n\r\nOn hearing this sudden confirmation of Tom's statement, Estremera\r\nstarted from the table, and buckled on a cutlass that hung on the\r\nafter-bulkhead; and then, with the brevity, but characteristic\r\ntaciturnity of a Spaniard, he proceeded to act with promptitude and\r\ndetermination, and instantly breaking open a case of ball-cartridges,\r\nbegan to distribute them.\r\n\r\n\"If so be there is a breeze on board, I'll make that Antonio dance\r\nOld Nick's hornpipe before it is over!\" said Tom Lambourne, angrily.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately, all the ship's muskets are below, I believe?\" remarked\r\nHislop.\r\n\r\n\"Si, senor.  Twenty stand are on a rack in the steerage,\" replied\r\nEstremera.  \"Santos! gentlemen, we must work hard.  Get all those\r\narms into the cabin and load them.  We have not a moment to lose!\"\r\n\r\n\"Run on deck, Tom; they don't know that we are alarmed yet.  Order\r\nall the _Eugenie's_ men, all others you can depend on, aft.  I fear\r\nours are the only lads this poor Spanish skipper can rely on now!\"\r\n\r\nIn less than _five_ minutes we had all the muskets conveyed from the\r\nrack in the steerage into the cabin.  We provided ourselves with\r\nball-cartridges; and then Hislop and I, with Manuel Gautier, the\r\nmate; the old Dutch governor, the captain, and even Fra Anselmo, in\r\nhis long black soutan (quoting \"that the end justified the means\")\r\nproceeded with all speed to load and cap the fire-arms.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the rolling of the loose shot upon the deck overhead still\r\ncontinued, and to that noise was now added the hallooing of the\r\nSpanish crew and the screaming of the Lascars, as they proceeded\r\ntogether from one act of open insubordination and outrage to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nSEQUEL TO THE MUTINY.\r\n\r\nThere were on board the _San Ildefonso_ ten survivors of the\r\n_Eugenie_, including myself; and fortunately for the ship at this\r\ncrisis, one of us, Francis Probart, the carpenter, was at the wheel,\r\nand remained steadily at his post during all that ensued; for had the\r\nsteering been relinquished for a moment, the vessel would have\r\nbroached to, and her masts must have gone overboard.\r\n\r\nThe captain, with his three mates, his surgeon, and cabin passengers,\r\nand our men, made up twenty in all; so we prepared at once for\r\ndefensive operations.\r\n\r\nThe wild hallooing increased with the thundering of the iron shot\r\noverhead, as they were bowled aft along the quarter-deck, smashing\r\nthe grated stern seats, and rebounding against the taffrail, over\r\nwhich some of them tumbled into the sea.\r\n\r\n\"We're all here, sir,--Ned Carlton, Jack the cook, Warren, Chute, and\r\neven boy Bill; but we want arms,\" cried Tom Lambourne down the\r\nskylight.\r\n\r\n\"On deck, and at them!\" said Hislop; and we rushed up the cabin\r\nstair, supplied each with two loaded muskets to arm our friends above.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the ship was running with a fine breeze, which was\r\npretty well aft.  She had several studding-sails set; and the\r\nextremely wide spread of her white canvas, which caught the\r\nsea-breeze one way, and the full yellow blaze of an African sunset\r\nthe other, made me think--but the idea only flashed on me and was\r\ngone instantly--that _if_ a tropical squall came on, while in\r\ncontention with our own crew, our fate would soon be sealed by the\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nShe had every thing set, even to little triangular scrapers, rigged\r\nto a skysail pole above her royals; and all this cloud of canvas was\r\nglittering in the red and yellow light reflected from the sun and\r\nclouds.\r\n\r\nBut the evening was lovely; the waves were in reality shining in\r\nliquid light on the western quarter of the ocean, as the sun,\r\n\"blood-red,\" to use a hackneyed term, dipping down past a succession\r\nof straight and horizontal crimson bars, sank slowly beyond what\r\nappeared to be the flaming edge of a watery world.\r\n\r\nBut we had no time for poetry, or for surveying the scene around us.\r\nThat which was about to ensue _within_ the bulwarks of the _San\r\nIldefonso_ was impressive and terrible enough!\r\n\r\n\"Hand us the muskets, gentlemen,\" said Ned Carlton, as we rushed up\r\nthe companion ladder.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for the tools and the men to use them!\" added Tom Lambourne,\r\nquoting some proverb, as the arms were promptly distributed; and to\r\nthe number of twenty we formed a line across the quarter-deck, a\r\nlittle way aft the mizzenmast.\r\n\r\nThis was achieved just in time, for with loud yells of \"Perros y\r\nladrones!\" (dogs and thieves!) \"Muera José Estremera!  Mueran los\r\nInglesos!\" a gang of yellow-visaged Spaniards armed with knives and\r\nhandspikes, and yellower Lascars with their terrible creeses, rushed\r\naft in two parties, one on the weather side of the ship, and another\r\non her lee; but, on being suddenly confronted by the levelled barrels\r\nof twenty muskets, they paused and wavered, though continuing to\r\nshout and brandish their weapons.\r\n\r\n\"Here goes for a shot at Antonio!\" said Lambourne, taking a\r\ndeliberate aim at that person; but Fra Anselmo laid a hand on his\r\narm, and besought him to pause.\r\n\r\n\"Don't spoil him outright for hanging,\" said Hislop; \"I would rather\r\nhave him with a rope at his neck, and all bearing a hand to run him\r\nup to the foreyard-arm, than shot dead like a sparrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on,\" shouted our men; \"come on, muzzle to muzzle!  None of your\r\nlubberly stand-off work!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fire at their legs, and simply disable as many of them as possible,\r\nbut spare life,\" said Fra Anselmo, in broken English.\r\n\r\n\"Fire at their heads, kill as many as possible, and spare none,\r\nthough you should leave the ship unmanned!\" said Estremera, in\r\nSpanish.\r\n\r\nLambert fired!\r\n\r\nHe missed; and the ball, after shaving the side of the long-boat\r\namidships, whistled into the sea far ahead, and Antonio uttered a\r\nfierce and derisive laugh, while the Lascars shrunk back with fear.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had not a single missile, for, most fortunately, all the\r\nloose shot for the ship's guns had been rolled aft, and lay in our\r\nrear.\r\n\r\nWhile both parties paused, one irresolute to advance, the other to\r\npour in their volley, I--being an old Eton bowler--resolved to make a\r\nwicket of the Cubano's legs.  I took up a nine-pound shot, which lay\r\nwith a score of others in the lee scuppers, and hurled it at him with\r\nall my strength.\r\n\r\nHe leaped aside nimbly, and escaped, while the shot bowled harmlessly\r\nalong the deck.  He rushed after it, doubtless with the intention of\r\nreturning it to me with compound interest; but fortunately for me, at\r\nthat moment Hislop, who had lost all patience, and was no doubt\r\nsmarting under the memory of his wounds and of Antonio's past\r\noutrages, cried,--\r\n\r\n\"Fire a volley and fall on them, my lads, with the butt ends of your\r\nmuskets!\"\r\n\r\nIt might have been better policy, considering the superior number of\r\nthe mutineers, for ten of us to have fired, and ten to have reserved\r\ntheir fire until the former reloaded; but Hislop's order was promptly\r\nresponded to.\r\n\r\nWe all poured in a confused volley, and then rushed on, in the smoke,\r\nwith clubbed muskets and a hearty English cheer.\r\n\r\nThere was a brief struggle, during which our men laid about them\r\nmercilessly, and knocked over the Spaniards like nine-pins; while I\r\nencountered one active and wiry old villain, the _tindal_ of the\r\nLascars, who rushed on me with his creese in his right hand, his body\r\ndoubled, and his head bent down.\r\n\r\nCharging him breast-high, the muzzle of my piece came crash upon the\r\ncrown of his caput, which a scarlet fez failed to protect, and so I\r\ntumbled him against one of the brass nines to leeward.\r\n\r\nOn seeing this the whole of the Lascars, instead of coming to his\r\nrescue, fled down the fore-hatchway.\r\n\r\nI gave the _tindal_ another tap on the head to enforce quietness, and\r\ntook away his creese.\r\n\r\n\"Help me to secure this rascal,\" cried I to our men; \"he will be a\r\nsurety for the other Lascars.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have him, sir, hard and fast, as if clenched in the dry nippers of\r\na Jamaica land-crab,\" said Tom Lambourne; and, in a few seconds, he\r\nhad the old copper-colored rogue seized by the hands and feet to one\r\nof the aftmost guns.\r\n\r\nThen we rushed forward to share in the scuffle, which was soon ended;\r\nfor just as Antonio, on seeing the turn matters had taken by the\r\nforce of our superior arms, was about to spring overboard, Hislop\r\nstruck him senseless by a blow from the butt-end of his musket, and\r\nflung him, like a bale of wool, upon the top of the Lascars, who\r\ncrowded about the bottom of the fore-hatchway ladder.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, porpoise-face!\" said he, fiercely, \"I have brought _you_ up with\r\na round turn at last!\"\r\n\r\nOne or two Spaniards now fled up the fore-rigging, whence they\r\nimplored us not to shoot them; but the squat _marinero_, Benito\r\nOjeda, and all the rest, were driven down the fore-hatch, where they\r\ncrowded at the foot of the ladder, treading the Lascars under foot,\r\ngrowling and menacing us with their knives and creeses, and\r\nthreatening to set fire to the ship,--a threat which they were quite\r\ncapable of fulfilling.\r\n\r\nOn the deck lay one Lascar dead, and two Lascars and one Spaniard who\r\nwere wounded in the legs.  In his death agony the first had driven\r\nthree inches of his sharp creese into the deck, when the blade broke\r\noff.\r\n\r\nProbart was still at the wheel, steering the ship so steadily that\r\nnot a cloth shivered aloft; but night was coming on, and as she was\r\ncovered with canvas, to reduce it was necessary, but first the\r\nmutinous crew must be crushed.  To Probart, as a spectator, the\r\nconflict must have presented an exciting scene; for, had we been\r\nbeaten, his fate as an Englishman would soon have been sealed.\r\n\r\nJosé Estremera, who had long been captain of a Spanish slaver, was\r\ninexorable!\r\n\r\n\"Manuel Gautier,\" cried he to the chief mate, \"cast loose that gun in\r\nthe weather-bow!\"\r\n\r\nManuel, a smart and handsome young fellow, with the surgeon and two\r\nothers, soon cast loose the lashings of the gun, and in a twinkling\r\nit was loaded, not with round shot, but with some thirty or forty\r\nball cartridges.\r\n\r\n\"Now, forward with it to the coaming of the hatchway,\" ordered the\r\ncaptain.\r\n\r\n\"But the bottom of the ship?\" urged Gautier.\r\n\r\n\"Blow these rascals through it!\" was the stern answer.\r\n\r\n\"Madre de Dios and all the saints keep us!\" implored Fra Anselmo,\r\ncrossing himself; \"senor, you do not mean to destroy them thus?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--like rats, padre mio,\" replied the Spanish captain.  \"Depress\r\nthe muzzle, hombres--up with the breech; clap a handspike under it,\r\nGautier.  Ready the fuse--a lucifer match or any thing will do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Miserecordia--O miserecordia!\" cried one fellow, looking up the\r\nhatchway with hands clasped, for the aspect of the round muzzle of\r\nthe depressed cannon filled them all with terror, and made the\r\nmiserable Lascars scream like children.\r\n\r\n\"Have mercy on us, senores!\" howled the Spaniards in chorus, again\r\nand again.\r\n\r\n\"And what then?\" asked Manuel Gautier, who was preparing a gun-match,\r\nas coolly as he might have made a paper cigarito.\r\n\r\n\"We shall return to our duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! no doubt, when we have got the weather gauge of you; but we mean\r\nto keep it, you cowardly picaroon!\" said Estremera.  \"Up yet with the\r\nbreech of the gun--cover as many of the wretches as you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"For pity's sake, senor,\" said Fra Anselmo, laying one hand on the\r\ncaptain's arm and the other on the trunnion of the brass cannon.\r\n\r\nOn looking down the hatch way, at that moment, my heart sickened when\r\nI beheld so many cowards crouching in a cold sweat beneath; so many\r\nuplifted hands; so many olive faces turning livid with terror; so\r\nmany dark and expressive eyes glaring upward to one point,--the\r\nmuzzle of the brass gun, which was to belch down death and mutilation\r\namong them; but there too lay Antonio el Cubano, covered with blood,\r\nand gazing at us with something like the smile of a mocking fiend in\r\nhis countenance.\r\n\r\n\"We are ready to surrender, senores,\" said Benito Ojeda; \"so, if you\r\nfire, our blood be upon your heads, and on that of El Cubano, who\r\nlured us into mischief!\"\r\n\r\nTheir united cries for mercy became so appalling, that, though they\r\nwould have yielded no mercy to us had the circumstances of the case\r\nbeen reversed, Estremera consented to withdraw the cannon on three\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\nFirst, that they would surrender every thing they possessed in the\r\nshape of a weapon.\r\n\r\nSecond, that they would handcuff and deliver up all their ringleaders.\r\n\r\nThird, that they would swear to be faithful to him and his mates for\r\nthe remainder of the voyage.\r\n\r\nTo these offers they agreed, and about forty Albacete knives and\r\ncreeses were thrown upon deck.\r\n\r\nHislop and I selected one or two as trophies of our victory, but\r\nManuel Gautier tossed all the rest overboard.\r\n\r\nTen pairs of handcuffs were then thrown down.  On this a tremendous\r\nrow ensued among the culprits, who were only quelled on seeing the\r\nmuzzle of the brass nine appear again; and in a few minutes Antonio,\r\nOjeda, and eight others were forced up the hatchway, and dragged aft\r\nto the quarter-deck.\r\n\r\nThe mutineers then came sullenly up, and the number of cuts and\r\nbruises about them showed how severely they had been handled.\r\n\r\nOn their knees, before Fra Anselmo, the Spaniards made a solemn\r\npromise of peaceful and good behavior for the future; as for the\r\nLascars, it was deemed advisable to keep their _tindal_ as a hostage\r\nfor their conduct in time to come.\r\n\r\nWhen I went aft I found him lying prostrate over the gun to which he\r\nwas bound, incapable of speech, and literally foaming at the mouth\r\nwith impotent rage.\r\n\r\nTom Lambourne laughed, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"Master Rodney, always tie the hands of a Lascar, if you wish to make\r\nhim hold his tongue.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they are like a Chinese; they can never speak when their\r\nhands are tied.  They can only sputter and choke like this old\r\nmountebank here.\"\r\n\r\nThose who returned to their duty received bandages, wadding, &c., for\r\ntheir cuts and bruises, and even a tot of wine each, in token of\r\namity.  The three wounded men were placed under the care of the\r\nsurgeon, and the dead Lascar was buried by his countrymen, who cast\r\nhim over to leeward, when a couple of sharks soon took care of him;\r\nfor we saw a black crooked fin on one side, and the white belly of a\r\nsecond monster on the other, as he turned up open-mouthed.\r\n\r\nThen the body vanished in a whirlpool, with a downward _jerk_ that\r\nmade our hearts shudder!\r\n\r\nThe prisoners were ropes-ended without mercy by Manuel Gautier and\r\nthe other two mates; they were also repeatedly drenched by buckets of\r\nsalt water, and we stood by with cocked muskets until the whole--ten\r\nSpaniards and one Lascar--were secured in the cable tier, where an\r\narmed sentinel watched them day and night during the remainder of the\r\nvoyage, a duty that frequently came to my turn, as I was a kind of\r\nwaister on board, and was seldom sent aloft.\r\n\r\nSo ended this exciting and most deplorable affair, which might have\r\nproved the destruction of the ship and of every well-disposed person\r\non board.\r\n\r\nThe twilight was passing with tropical rapidity, and when all was\r\nover, the hands were sent aloft to reduce the canvas.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by the studdingsail-halyards,\" shouted Manuel Gautier, in his\r\nown language.  These sails were soon taken in, and the lower spars\r\nboom-ended alongside, while the royals and skysails were sent on\r\ndeck, the loose shot were replaced in the rack round the coaming of\r\nthe main-hatch, all loose ropes were tightly belayed or coiled away;\r\nand now, as the freshening breeze came more and more aft, the stately\r\nSpanish merchant ship bade good-night to the shores of Poison Island,\r\nand bore away through the silent sea toward the Cape de Verd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nTHE COAST OF AFRICA.\r\n\r\nAll these scenes made a terrible impression upon me.  It seemed now\r\nindeed that the boyish \"dream of life was at an end, and that its\r\n_action_ had begun.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole affair, in all its details, furnished ample scope for\r\nconversation in the cabin for some time after; and too well we knew\r\nwhat our fate would have been, but for the promptitude of Estremera,\r\nand the courage of Marc Hislop and his Englishmen.\r\n\r\nTo each of the latter, the Dutch governor of Surabaya, grateful for\r\nhis preservation from a cruel death, gave a gold doubloon, and José\r\nEstremera added five dollars per man.\r\n\r\nTo Hislop and me he presented each a pair of handsome brass-barrelled\r\nSpanish pistols, and from the governor we received each a valuable\r\ndiamond ring; but Marc was quite the lion of the cabin passengers\r\nduring the remainder of the voyage.\r\n\r\nFra Anselmo was greatly surprised by the extent of his scholarship\r\nand varied knowledge, which far exceeded the acquirements of most\r\nyoung seamen; but Hislop, who was a modest fellow, considered them as\r\nquite a matter of course, education being so generally diffused in\r\nhis country.\r\n\r\nAmong our men, when any point was in dispute, it was common to hear\r\nthem say,--\r\n\r\n\"Ask Master Hislop, he knows every thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he does,\" added Tattooed Tom, one day; \"blowed if I didn't\r\nhear him beat that Portuguese friar all to nothing at talking in\r\nthree different lingoes the other afternoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, Tom, I am very far from knowing every thing,\" answered\r\nHislop; \"I am only a hard-working seaman like yourself; but I have\r\npicked up some knowledge of different matters.  You must know many a\r\nthing that I don't know, for even the greatest men in the world can\r\nonly learn a part of what can be known, and thus, at times, are as\r\nignorant as those poor Lascars.  But I have to thank my good mother\r\nat home, in old Scotland, for sparing nothing on me when a boy, and\r\nsince then I have made myself,--as any man, indeed, who has the will\r\nmay do.\"\r\n\r\nAnd it seemed to me that there was much sound sense in what the\r\nScotchman said.\r\n\r\nOn the morning, after the extinction of the mutiny, we came to anchor\r\na league to the northward of Warrang, for what reason I know not\r\nunless it was that the wind blew hard and the land was on our lee.\r\n\r\nIt was my _trick_ at the helm (as the two hours usually allotted to\r\nthat duty are named), and when, for the purpose of stopping the\r\nship's way, and bringing her head to the wind, and making the canvas\r\nshake prior to furling up, Manuel Gautier sang out in Spanish,--\r\n\r\n\"Timonero, luff and touch her!\"  I did not understand him, and nearly\r\nhad the wheel twitched out of my hands.\r\n\r\nThe anchor was let go, and the great ship swung round with her head\r\nto the wind, which blew from the westward, and with her carved and\r\npainted stern to the green and wooded isle of Warrang, which is the\r\nmost northerly of those that compose the archipelago of the Bissagos,\r\na group of twenty little isles, lying near the mouth of the Rio\r\nGrande, in West Africa.\r\n\r\nBanks of mud and sand render all these isles dangerous on the\r\nseaward.  With the exception of Warrang, they are all inhabited by a\r\nwild and robust race of savages called the Bijaguas, who are of great\r\nstature, and are warlike and intrepid.\r\n\r\nThough thirty miles in length, Warrang, with all its fertility, is\r\ndestitute of inhabitants, being totally without springs or water.\r\n\r\nWhile at anchor, we saw a dark savage, in a canoe, floundering about\r\nin the apple-green shoal water that lay between us and the land.\r\nWithout fear he paddled close to the ship, and on signs being made\r\nthat he might come on board, he moored his canoe under the mizzen\r\nchains, and sprang up the side with ease and confidence.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall and powerfully made man, with features of the lowest\r\nAfrican type, and close curly wool on his head, but without a vestige\r\nof clothing, unless a string of beads were to be considered as such,\r\nand a little paint like ochre in color.\r\n\r\nHe pointed to the sea and then to his parched mouth, implying that he\r\nhad been fishing, and was thirsty.\r\n\r\nSome water was brought from the scuttle-butt; he drank of it\r\ngreedily, and then patted his breast in token of gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe tattooing on Lambourne's face particularly attracted his\r\nattention, and seemed to excite his admiration; but poor Tom, with\r\nwhom this unwished for decoration was a tender point, had no desire\r\nto fraternize with our sable visitor, and walking forward he leant\r\nagainst one of the windlass bitts and smoked his pipe sulkily.\r\n\r\nThe Bijagua now offered us his fish, which were strung upon a green\r\nwithe, and Estremera presented him in return a gaudy old muleteer's\r\njacket, which, being covered with brass buttons and red braid, would\r\nthus, he conceived, please the eye of a savage.\r\n\r\nThe Bijagua turned it round and viewed it in various ways, as if it\r\npuzzled him, upon which Hislop showed him how to put it on, and then\r\nattempted to persuade him to run his arms through the sleeves.\r\n\r\nWhat idea occurred to the savage I know not; whether he conceived\r\nhimself insulted, or that his personal liberty was in danger, but\r\nuttering a yell, he overthrew both Hislop and Estremera, and\r\nspringing down the ship's side with the agility of a monkey, reached\r\nhis canoe, and in half a minute was clear of the _San Ildefonso_ and\r\npaddling vigorously in-shore.\r\n\r\n\"This reminds me,\" said Hislop, when he had gathered himself up and\r\nregained his breath, \"of an old voyager of whom I once read.  About a\r\nhundred years ago, a Captain Weddel, who commanded the ship _Royal\r\nCharles_, was at anchor in Augustine Bay, off the coast of\r\nMadagascar, and there he insisted on clothing a savage in a complete\r\nsuit of clothes, including a bob-wig and three-cornered hat.\r\n\r\n\"'They will keep you warm,' said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"'But I am warm enough without them,' replied the savage, writhing\r\nand perspiring in attire so unusual to him.\r\n\r\n\"'They will defend your skin.'\r\n\r\n\"The savage laughed scornfully, saying,--\r\n\r\n\"'With my smallest arrow I can pierce them through and through.'\r\n\r\n\"He was in an agony of fear, and felt as if fettered with irons, and\r\nentreated so earnestly to be set on shore, that his wish was granted.\r\nThe moment his foot was on the land, with every expression of rage\r\nand fury, he was seen to cast his hat one way, the wig another.  Then\r\nhe rent the coat and shirt from his back, the breeches soon followed,\r\nand he spat and danced upon them, in mingled contempt for attire, and\r\njoy that he was once more free.  Our friend, the Bijagua, seems\r\ncertainly to have shared his spirit and ideas.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening, on the wind veering round and becoming more\r\nsoutherly, we prepared again for sea, and Hislop was directed to\r\nweigh the anchor, by _underrunning_ the cable in the longboat, as the\r\ntide had ebbed, and we were in exceedingly shallow water, which was\r\ncovered with green and slimy stuff, probably the inland débris of the\r\nRio Grande.\r\n\r\nThis mode of weighing our Scotch mate performed skilfully, by placing\r\nthe chain cable over the davit-head of the boat, and underrunning it\r\ntill the anchor was apeak, when it was tripped by means of a\r\nbuoy-rope.\r\n\r\nThere was a great length of cable out, for the water was so low that\r\nthe ship could not have been hove to the anchor without danger.\r\n\r\n\"We'll make sailors of these Spanish lubbers before this voyage is\r\nover,\" I heard Lambourne say to Hislop, as they scrambled on board,\r\nand then the boat was hoisted in.\r\n\r\nThe evening sun was burning hot, and shed a red glare upon the green\r\nslime of the shallow sea, till it seemed to swelter in its heat,\r\nemitting an oppressive miasma that would have been deadly had we\r\nlingered long there.\r\n\r\nThe strange trees that fringed the shore were seen to toss their\r\ngreat cabbage-like leaves on the rising wind; but, as we speedily\r\nreceded from the coast, they gradually lessened to the size of\r\nshrubs, and from shrubs to the size of little weeds, until they\r\nfinally disappeared, when Warrang melted into the waves astern, as\r\nthe _San Ildefonso_ soon made a good offing and bore away to sea.\r\n\r\nOur prisoners were now very effectually subdued.\r\n\r\nMore heavily ironed than the rest, Antonio sat ever silent and\r\nsullen, with his black-bearded chin sunk upon his breast; and\r\nfrequently when it came to my turn to be posted as sentinel over him\r\nand the others in the cable tier, I could see, by the dim light of\r\nthe horn lantern, which swung from the beam above (serving chiefly\r\n\"to make the darkness visible\"), his keen, fierce eyes fixed on me\r\nwith a rattlesnake glare, which seemed to say, if a glance of hate\r\nand spite could kill, he would slay me.\r\n\r\nAfter he became used to having his hands fettered, the old _tindal_\r\nof the Lascars was by far the most lively and conversable of the\r\ndingy gang, who all sat in a row, with their feet locked in the iron\r\nbilboes.\r\n\r\nOne day I gave this old fellow some wine and water, when he was\r\nalmost sinking amid the stifling atmosphere of the den in which he\r\nwas confined.\r\n\r\nHis gratitude was unbounded, and in a burst of confidence--which\r\nbrought upon him the maledictions of the rest--he informed me in\r\nbroken English (of which he had picked up a smattering during a\r\nvoyage in one of our old Indiamen), that had the mutiny been\r\nsuccessful, every one of us would have been made to walk the plank to\r\nleeward, and then the ship was to have been run ashore in some\r\nconvenient creek, dismasted there, to conceal her from the seaward,\r\nand then to be completely plundered;--on the whole, unfolding a\r\nstrange and incomprehensible project.\r\n\r\nWhen he concluded, I smiled significantly, and tapped the butt of my\r\nloaded musket, as much as to say,--\r\n\r\n\"It is all very well, old boy, but we weathered you fairly!\"\r\n\r\nAs we approached the Cape de Verd, Estremera issued strict orders\r\nthat no man was to sleep on deck at night, for fear of moon\r\nblindness--an ailment not uncommon in the tropics.  An old voyager,\r\nSir Richard Hawkins, relates that the moon's rays off the African\r\ncoast have a singularly pernicious effect upon the human body, and\r\nthat \"he knew a person who, sleeping one night in his cabin on the\r\ncoast of Guinea, with the moon shining upon him, had such a violent\r\npain burning in his shoulder, that for above twenty hours he was like\r\na madman, and was not freed from it at last without a great many\r\napplications and abundance of suffering;\" though what this ailment\r\nwas, would now greatly puzzle one to discover.\r\n\r\nAfter a delightful run, on one of the last days of autumn, we sighted\r\nthe Cape de Verd and the Isle of Goree.\r\n\r\nThose rose on our starboard bow, rapidly and abruptly, for the ship\r\nwas running before the wind at the rate of nine knots an hour, with\r\nall her studding-sails rigged out.\r\n\r\nIt was about dawn when land was first discovered from aloft, and by\r\nmidday the Isle of Goree bore about three miles off on our starboard\r\nbeam.\r\n\r\nThe wind now fell light, and, as the ship crept along, we had a good\r\nopportunity for observing the coast by our telescopes.\r\n\r\nFra Anselmo, who had once resided there as a missionary, drew my\r\nattention to the sea of floating weeds, called the _sargasso_,\r\nthrough which we were sailing,--weeds which are so brilliant and so\r\ngreen as to impart a peculiar hue to the water, and thereby gave the\r\npromontory its name,--the Cape de _Verd_.\r\n\r\nAlong the shore we could see groves of the orange, the lemon, the\r\npomegranate, and the citron tree, with their ripe golden fruit\r\nstudding the green foliage like golden balls.\r\n\r\nOn the almost inaccessible isle of Goree, Fra Anselmo showed to us\r\nthe old castle of St. Michael, which was built by the Dutch in 1617,\r\nand stormed forty-six years after by the English, under Admiral\r\nHolmes.  In 1664 it was retaken by Adrian de Ruyter, after a little\r\nband of sixty British soldiers, under a Scotsman, named Sir George\r\nAbercrombie, made a defence so protracted and so resolute, that they\r\nonly surrendered after the walls were battered to ruin, and all their\r\nammunition was expended.\r\n\r\nIt was not without deep interest that we viewed these scenes and\r\nheard those forgotten fragments of our past history, when so far from\r\nold England, and while sailing along a shore so wild and vast as\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nWe used soundings while skirting the dangerous shoal known as\r\nCompan's Bank, _over_ which it is alleged a famous buccaneer, named\r\nNicholas Compan, sailed his galley; and by sunset the Cape de Verd\r\nwas far astern, and nothing but the blue sea around us again; for now\r\nthat wondrous shore receded eastward, far away toward the mouth of\r\nthe Senegal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\nSANTA CRUZ.\r\n\r\nA few days after crossing the tropic of Cancer, on a lovely\r\nafternoon, we again saw the Peak of Teneriffe lighted up by the\r\nwestern sunshine, and rising like a cone of red flame from the blue\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThe clouds seemed to rise with it, and ere long we saw its base\r\nspreading out beneath them.\r\n\r\n\"Tennyreef again!\" I heard old Tom Lambourne muttering, as he leaned\r\nover the lee bow with a short pipe in his mouth; \"Dash my wig!  I\r\nhave had a spell enough of Tennyreef before this!\"\r\n\r\nManuel Gautier and Hislop now came with a party of seamen to get the\r\nanchors off the forecastle to her bows.  This was no light task, the\r\nreader may be assured, for they were each about forty-five hundred\r\nweight; and now the ponderous cables rattled along the deck as they\r\nwere bent to the iron rings.\r\n\r\nWe approached this singular island from a point that was new to me;\r\nbut still its great and most familiar features were the same as when\r\nI first saw them from the deck of the _Eugenie_.\r\n\r\nEstremera now reminded us that, when at Teneriffe, we should not fail\r\nto visit the two great sights of the island--the Valley of the\r\nDiamond and the old Dragon-tree of Caora.\r\n\r\nThe wind was fresh and fair, but fell light after sunset; and when\r\nthe high land of the Grand Canary was on our starboard beam, it\r\nalmost died away.  As we crept on we saw the lighthouse at the base\r\nof La Montana Roxo, sparkling like a star above the waves of the sea,\r\nwhich in the warm sunset seemed to have turned into blood or\r\nport-wine, so deeply crimson was the glow that lingered on the clouds\r\nand on the shore; and then the vast peak--save where girdled in mid\r\nair by a light floating vapor--seemed all of a deep violet tint,\r\ndotted at its base by the white walls of houses, or of sugar-mills,\r\nand by groves of cocoa and rosewood trees.\r\n\r\nDarkness was soon there, but still the sunset lingered in rays of\r\nfire upon the mighty Peak of Adam, on which the eye never tired of\r\ngazing.\r\n\r\nBy midnight we were abreast of it, and all was darkness at last, save\r\nwhere the millions of stars were sparkling in the wide blue dome of\r\nthe sky.\r\n\r\nHislop and I were in the morning watch when the ship arrived off the\r\nmouth of the harbor of Santa Cruz--that pretty town, which Humboldt\r\ntermed the grand caravanserai between Spain and the Indies.\r\n\r\nA flash that broke upon the darkness, with a light puff of smoke\r\nfloating away from the old castle walls, indicated the morning gun,\r\nand that dawn was visible.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if it were but yesterday when the _Eugenie_ and the\r\nCosta Rican brig had worked out of the same harbor together, in the\r\nsame species of dull twilight, and that all which had passed since\r\nthat time had been a dream.\r\n\r\nWe beat in with the breeze ahead.  The light of another day was\r\nrapidly _descending_ from the summit of the peak, and already that\r\ngreen girdle, named the Region of Laurels, was shining in the\r\nsunbeams; so ere long we saw the windows of the custom-house, which\r\nstands above the long mole, and all the shaded lattices of the\r\nterraced streets of Santa Cruz, glittering in gold and purple sheen.\r\n\r\nThe anchors were ready to be let go; the chain-cables were ranged\r\nupon deck in long coils that ran fore and aft; we tacked repeatedly;\r\nand each time the tacks became shorter and more frequent.\r\n\r\n\"Ready about!  Presto! down with the helm,--let fly the head-sheets!\"\r\nwere the orders heard incessantly from Estremera and Manuel Gautier.\r\n\r\nThe yards slewed round sharply, and the canvas flapped with a sound\r\nlike the cracking of musketry; at last, the anchor was let go about a\r\nhalf-mile from the shore in thirty fathoms water and the ship swung\r\nround head to wind as her courses were brailed up, and the men\r\nhurried aloft to hand the topsails and topgallant-sails; so she was\r\nsoon denuded of her canvas.\r\n\r\nWhen the anchor plunged into the frothy water, making a thousand\r\nconcentric ripples run from the ship; and when I felt, by the instant\r\nstrain upon the cable, that she had firm hold of the ground, my heart\r\nswelled with unalloyed happiness; for to be in Teneriffe was to be\r\nfar on the watery high road to my home.\r\n\r\nSanta Cruz, being the capital of these isles, is the residence of the\r\nCaptain-General of the Canaries, the seat of the supreme court of\r\nlaw, and of all the consuls and commissaries of foreign powers, whose\r\nvarious flags, when displayed upon their houses, make the handsome\r\nstreets as gay in aspect as the harbor, which is always crowded by\r\nthe shipping of every nation.\r\n\r\nA custom-house boat, with the Spanish ensign floating at the stern,\r\ncame promptly off with an official, a dandified Creole in uniform,\r\nwith a sombrero on his curly head, a sabre at his side, and a cigar\r\nin his mouth.  To him Captain Estremera made a full report of the\r\nmutiny which had broken out in his ship when off the African coast,\r\nand the stern mode of its suppression.\r\n\r\nHence, in two hours after, we had the satisfaction of seeing Antonio\r\nel Cubano, Benito Ojeda, the old tindal of the Lascars, and eight\r\nother rascals, taken off to the Castle of Santa Cruz, in a large open\r\nboat, guarded by twelve Spanish soldiers, in charge of a lieutenant,\r\nDon Luiz Pineda.\r\n\r\nI can still recall the glance of impotent and baffled malignity that\r\nAntonio bestowed on us as he went down the ship's side.  It combined\r\nall the worst emotions of his angry heart, and somewhat reminded me\r\nof his face in that terrible moment when he swung at the end of the\r\nstuddingsail-boom, with despair in his clutch and death at his heart.\r\n\r\nWe watched the boat till it reached the long stone mole, and then we\r\nsaw the fixed bayonets of the escort flashing, as the whole party\r\nascended the great stair toward the custom-house, and surrounded by a\r\nmob of those nautical idlers who usually make a pier their lounge,\r\ndisappear in the interior of the town, as they marched toward the\r\ncastle.\r\n\r\nTwo episodes more will close the story of Antonio,--his trial and\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD DRAGON-TREE OF CAORA.\r\n\r\nThe trial came on in a couple of days after, and proceeded with a\r\ncelerity unknown in England or Scotland either.  We were all\r\nexamined, and previously were sworn, not on a Bible, but over two\r\nsword-blades held in the form of a cross,--for such is the old\r\nchivalric custom in a Spanish court of law.\r\n\r\nWithout hesitation the judges found Antonio guilty; he was sentenced\r\nto die by the _garotte_; and heard his doom with apparent apathy.\r\n\r\nThe _tindal_ of the Lascars was released, as it would appear that he\r\nhad acted under compulsion; but Benito Ojeda and eight other Spanish\r\nseamen were sentenced to work in the fortifications or on the\r\nhighways for ten years, in chains, as felons or galley-slaves.\r\n\r\nThe trial over, Hislop and I gladly left the crowded hall of justice,\r\nand made our way through the streets of Santa Cruz, passing a mingled\r\npopulation of yellow mulattoes, Spanish laborers, negro\r\nwater-carriers, mercantile men, old ecclesiastics, and importunate\r\nbeggars, till we reached our hotel, the windows of which faced the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nThere we resolved to dine, and then ride over to Orotava, to see the\r\nwonderful tree which grows near it, taking care, however, to provide\r\nourselves with rifles and ammunition for our protection as the\r\nadventures of Tom Lambourne and myself were too recent to be\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nOn our return we hoped to be able to visit the Valley of the famous\r\nDiamond, which was only visible in the night.\r\n\r\nI have little more to relate now than what would seem more suitable\r\nto a traveller's commonplace book than the conclusion of adventures\r\nso wild as mine have been; and so must hasten on.\r\n\r\nAt the posada in the main street of Santa Cruz we procured horses;\r\nand leaving the fertile plain in which the little city stands,\r\ntraversed a bleak and barren mountain-track for some leagues, until\r\nwe reached the town of Orotava, or Caora, as it was named of old when\r\nthe Dragon-tree was a sapling.  It is built on the western side of\r\nthe isle, and is both pretty and picturesque.\r\n\r\nThe mighty force of the Atlantic was breaking on the shore, in\r\nbillows so vast, so white, so over-arching, and with a sound so\r\nthundering, that they exceeded all we had ever heard before.  The sky\r\nwas becoming black to the northwest, and he could see the ships at\r\nanchor near Porto de la O getting under way, and shaking out their\r\ncourses with all speed, to make a safe offing in case a squall came\r\non.\r\n\r\nOrotava, a pretty little town, clean and neatly built, stands upon\r\nthe green slope of a beautiful hill, and faces the Atlantic.  Ruins\r\nof sugar-mills and wine-presses were to be seen here and there among\r\nthe corn and maize-fields, the vineyards and gardens; for these\r\nremains, now almost covered by creepers and luxuriant plants, are the\r\nruined fragments of the edifices destroyed by the great hurricane of\r\n1826.\r\n\r\nWe reached an inn, gave our horses to the stable-boy, dined on a\r\ngalina stewed with beans (and garlic of course); we had some native\r\nwine, and for a shilling might have had a sackful of pineapples.\r\n\r\nFrom the windows of the posada, as we sat at dinner, we watched the\r\nwaves rolling in mountains of snowy foam, before the wind, in-shore;\r\nand all the craft weighing or slipping their cables, and beating\r\nclose-hauled under topsails and courses to attain good sea-room, lest\r\nthey might be driven on the rocks.  It was a lively sight, and a\r\nstirring one.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, for a fair wind when we sail again!\" said I.  \"I would beg,\r\nborrow, or steal one, if I knew where such commodities were to be\r\nhad.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis a pity you are not a subject of King Eric-with-the-Windy-Cap,\"\r\nreplied Hislop, while making up a cigarito.  \"See how clumsily those\r\nlubbers sheer that brig to her anchor!  Why the deuce don't they keep\r\nthe current right ahead, and lessen the strain on the chain-cable?  I\r\nshouldn't like to have my fingers between it and the hawse-pipe just\r\nnow.  Why, she's forging broadside on!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was King Eric-with-the-Windy-Cap?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Did you ever read _Olaus Magnus_?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; the name would seem enough for me.  Moreover, we don't read\r\nScotch poetry at Eton.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was one of the oldest annalists of Scandinavia, and you lose a\r\ndeal in not reading him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but this Eric----\" I resumed.\r\n\r\n\"Was King of Sweden.  He was surnamed _Waderhat_, and was deemed in\r\nhis time a great sorcerer,--so great, that he ranked second to none\r\nin that kind of craft.  He was on the most familiar terms with all\r\nkinds of goblins and evil spirits, and constructed a peculiar cap,\r\nwhich by spells he endowed with such extraordinary power that the\r\nwind would blow from whichever way he chose to turn it.  Our old\r\nScotch fishermen in Orkney and Shetland, who are half Norsemen, can\r\nspin yarns by the hour about King Eric Waderhat; and it was by his\r\naid, says Olaus, and thus being able to have always a fair wind, that\r\nthe great pirate, Regner, King of Denmark, who was his nephew,\r\ncarried the terror of his name to the uttermost parts of Europe.  But\r\nnow, Dick, as the bones of the galina are picked clean, as the wine\r\nis drunk, and the sun in the west, let us be off to see this famous\r\nold bit of arboriculture,--the Dragon Tree of Caora.  Ah! that brig\r\nhas got her anchor apeak at last; the port-tacks are close aboard,\r\nand the jib hoisted, and--by George! if her stupid fiddle-head is\r\nlong in paying off she'll be foul of that polacca!  But here comes\r\nthe senor de casa.\"\r\n\r\nWe asked the landlord, who entered at that moment, where the famous\r\ntree stood; on which he politely offered to accompany us; and\r\ncertainly our visit was not time wasted.\r\n\r\nIn the garden of a Senor Franqui (whose father showed it to\r\nHumboldt), we saw this gigantic specimen of the many-headed palm, the\r\naged Dragon Tree of Caora.\r\n\r\nIts stem is forty-eight feet in diameter, and ascends like a solid\r\npillar to the height of sixty feet, from whence an incredible number\r\nof strangely twisted and fantastic branches shoot off in every\r\ndirection, but all bearing flowers and fruit.\r\n\r\n\"This, senores,\" said the hostalero, \"is said by a learned\r\ntraveller----\"\r\n\r\n\"Aye,\" interrupted Hislop; \"you mean Humboldt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Si, senor,--to be the oldest tree in the world.  Documents exist in\r\nthe town of Santa Cruz which prove that in the fifteenth\r\ncentury--that is, when the Spaniards first came here under Don\r\nAlphonso, Ferdinand of Lugo, and others--it was just the size we see\r\nit now, and not a twig more or less.\r\n\r\n\"This is very likely, Dick,\" said Hislop, in English, turning to me;\r\n\"but for all that, it is not the oldest tree in the world.  Europe\r\nand Asia are full of trees with doubtful or fabulous ages; but M. de\r\nCandolle, of Geneva, asserts that the most ancient tree in the\r\nworld--one which was in full bloom when our Saviour was born--is the\r\nold yew of Fortingall, at the mouth of Glenlyon, in Scotland.  Well,\r\nsenor,\" he resumed, in Spanish, \"and this palm?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alphonso de Lugo struck it thrice with his sword, in token that\r\nTeneriffe and all the adjacent isles belonged to Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, to Castile, and to the Catholic Church.\"\r\n\r\n\"What wonders, and how many changes has the world seen since _then_!\r\nAnd this old tree is in bloom and bearing yet!\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" added Hislop, as we turned to leave the garden of Senor\r\nFranqui, \"that Humboldt says this species is very slow in growth; and\r\nthat the Dragon Tree required a thousand years to attain its present\r\nmaturity.\"\r\n\r\n\"A thousand years!\" I repeated, looking at it with that vague emotion\r\nof interest which is generally excited by the knowledge that we are\r\nlooking on what we, in all probability, shall never see again.\r\n\r\nIt was near evening when we returned to the posada; and after giving\r\na \"consideration\" to the hostalero, who was a very pleasant and\r\nintelligent Spanish colonist from the old city of Iaen, in Andalusia,\r\nwe mounted to return; on which he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Senores Inglesos, you should not leave Teneriffe without visiting\r\nthe Valley of the Diamond.\"\r\n\r\n\"We had some thoughts of doing so,\" said Hislop; \"but is it far from\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\n\"About a league and half.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where away?\"\r\n\r\n\"Among the mountains, on the northern slope of the great peak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! the scenery looks rather wild thereabout,\" replied Hislop; \"but\r\n'twere a pity to leave without having a look at it, after all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may remember, Marc,\" said I, \"that this diamond is particularly\r\nmentioned in the old volume of voyages which I found in the\r\nwater-logged brig at Alphonso.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to be sure I do,\" replied Hislop; \"and that book, I think, must\r\nform part of _La Collection de Viages y Discubrimientos_.  The\r\ndiamond was first seen by Albuquerque and Tristan da Cunha, senor\r\nhostalero.  I believe that it shines only in the night,\" said Marc,\r\nturning to the landlord.\r\n\r\n\"But then it beams like a star in heaven, senores,\" replied the\r\nSpaniard, crossing himself.\r\n\r\n\"You have seen it then?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! senor, a hundred times and more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it supposed to be worth much?\"\r\n\r\n\"From its light and size, many millions of duros.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet it has been allowed to glitter away there for more than\r\nthree hundred and fifty years!\" I exclaimed, with incredulity.\r\n\r\n\"Because, senor, its exact locality can never be discovered, even by\r\nthe most active searchers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"On their approach it gradually fades, and finally disappears.\"\r\n\r\n\"But in daylight?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a trace of it can be found among the rocks, though a thousand\r\nmen have searched for it a thousand times, till their fingers were\r\nworn and their hearts grew sick.\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" we exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Many an illustrious senor who has been captain-general of the\r\nCanaries for his Most Catholic Majesty has offered a thousand duros\r\nfor its discovery, and many a dog of a Jew has almost lost his senses\r\nin the rocky valley; others have nearly died of starvation rather\r\nthan quit the search; but it always seems to melt away on being\r\napproached or as day dawns, so there are many who aver that it is no\r\ndiamond at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\"\r\n\r\n\"An enchanted light,\" replied the hostalero.\r\n\r\nHislop seemed to ponder for a moment; then a bright smile spread over\r\nhis jovial and sunburnt face, and he asked,--\r\n\r\n\"Will this be a good night for seeing it, think you, senor hostalero?\"\r\n\r\n\"The innkeeper turned to the north-west, where the clouds were still\r\nbanking up in heavy masses.\r\n\r\n\"Si, senor; I should say so.\"\r\n\r\n\"At what distance is this diamond visible, and from what spot?\"\r\n\r\nThe Spaniard now gave us a knowing glance; his keen black eyes\r\nglittered, and he laughed aloud.\r\n\r\n\"Par todos santos, if _you_, senor, have any desire for getting it,\r\nyou may find it easier to call down one of the blessed stars that are\r\nnow beginning to twinkle in the heavens above us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind what I wish; but say, where is it to be seen?\"\r\n\r\n\"If you ride fast, senores, the light will yet enable you to reach\r\nthe valley,\" replied the hostalero, still smiling,--almost grinning,\r\nin fact.\r\n\r\n\"Pursue the way from this to the eastward for nearly a league,\r\npassing on your left La Montanza de Centejo, and so on, till you\r\nreach a well shaded by three old rosewood trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"What next?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wheel off by a narrow path that lies to the right, and pass between\r\ntwo rocks; you will then see the summit of the great peak before you;\r\nand after proceeding about a mile, you will come to a flat stone, and\r\nfrom there you will perceive the diamond (if the atmosphere serves)\r\nshining like a light in the face of the rock, about fifty yards or so\r\nbefore you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Muchos gratios, senor,\" said Hislop; \"these directions seem very\r\nclear.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad senor is pleased,\" replied the hostalero, removing his\r\nbroad straw hat.\r\n\r\n\"Could you oblige me with a piece of hard chalk?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hard chalk,\" reiterated the hostalero; \"certainly, senor,\" and in a\r\nsecond he brought a piece from his kitchen.\r\n\r\nHislop thanked him, placed it in his pocket, and we rode off just as\r\nthe clear twilight began to deepen with the most magnificent effects\r\nof lingering light and purple shadow on land and sea, on mountain,\r\nisle, and shore.\r\n\r\n\"What are you about to do with that piece of chalk?\" asked I; \"for\r\nassuredly there is something veiled under the request.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall soon learn,--that is, if we see this real or enchanted\r\ndiamond,\" said Hislop, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I shall put this diamond, if such indeed it is, into my old\r\nmother's lap, when I go home to Scotland!\" said he, with a boisterous\r\nlaugh, in which I could not resist joining.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nTHE VALLEY OF THE DIAMOND.\r\n\r\nWe rode due eastward by a narrow path that traversed mountains of\r\nrock, covered by wild laurels, rosewood trees, and vines.  Far away\r\non our left, wearing the deepest indigo tint, spread the ocean, the\r\nhorizon line of which was distinctly seen against a sky of coppery\r\nred that appeared beneath the bank of squally clouds, which were fast\r\ndispersing now, or whirling upward into mid air and melting away.\r\n\r\nIn a valley on our left some lights were seen to glitter as if from\r\nthe windows of houses.\r\n\r\n\"That is Montanza de Centejo, no doubt,\" said Hislop.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more we saw the three rosewood trees, and then the\r\nwayside well beneath the shadow of their branches.  It was a simple\r\nand rude arch of stone, from a wooden duct in which the water flowed\r\ninto a stone basin.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the fountain,\" said I; \"and now our path to the right--\"\r\n\r\n\"Lies through a gap in these rocks.\"\r\n\r\n\"An ugly place!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is your rifle loaded, Dick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,--and capped too,\" said I.\r\n\r\nPassing through a gorge in the piles of rock that rose on our right,\r\nwe found ourselves in a large and rugged ravine, through which, under\r\nmasses of creepers, there brawled a rough black mountain torrent, and\r\nby its side there wound a narrow path.\r\n\r\nThis ravine had been formed by that convulsion of nature which took\r\nplace during the visit of Alphonso de Albuquerque and Tristan de\r\nCunha, when the famous diamond was said to have first become visible.\r\n\r\nThe stupendous cone of the great Piton rose before us at the end of\r\nthe ravine.  In some places the latter was dark as blackest night\r\ncould be, while the former, for some thousand feet of its height,\r\nbelow even the region of laurels, was bathed in a pure white flood of\r\nsilver sheen, for a splendid moon had now arisen from the sea.\r\n\r\nAfter proceeding with our horses at a walk for about a mile, looking\r\ncarefully for the next landmark mentioned by the hostalero, Hislop\r\ndrew up and dismounted, saying,--\r\n\r\n\"Here it is, Dick.\"\r\n\r\nI also dismounted, and found near the pathway a stone which had\r\nevidently once stood upright, but now it lay flat among the long\r\ngrass and wild flowers that grew there.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the gloom which yet enveloped us I could make out an\r\ninscription, partly by feeling with my fingers.  It was deeply cut,\r\nand ran thus:\r\n\r\n\"_Aqvi mataron a Juan Hererro_.  1850.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here they slew John Smith,\" said Hislop, echoing, or rather, freely\r\ntranslating the legend.\r\n\r\n\"They,--who were _they_?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some robbers, no doubt; perhaps, like us, he came in search of the\r\ngreat diamond.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then is he buried here, think you?\" asked I, instinctively stepping\r\nback from the stone.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot say.  It is lively this, and not a bit of moonshine here\r\nyet!\"\r\n\r\nEagerly and anxiously we gazed about us, but saw not a ray of light\r\nin the dark valley or ravine; and though neither of us said so at the\r\ntime, we were not without vague suspicions of having been fooled, or,\r\nit might be, lured into some awkward trap; for our ideas of the\r\nSpanish character had by no means improved upon acquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see the diamond yet, Dick?\" asked my friend for the third\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\"Not I.  Are you sure that we are on the spot from which it is\r\nvisible.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Here_, by this flat stone, we were to stand.  Try a little more to\r\nyour right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see nothing yet.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause, during which we walked about, peering into the\r\nobscurity.\r\n\r\n\"Stay,--I see something!\" I exclaimed, in an excited tone.  \"Come\r\nthis way--a yard or so--it _shines now_!\" I added, when, after\r\nstepping a pace or two to the left, a faint gleam, like the first ray\r\nof a small and very distant revolving beacon--a tiny one\r\nindeed--stole upon the gloom; and then a steady sparkle, like that of\r\na star, shone through the pitchy blackness that enveloped the whole\r\nlength and breadth of the hollow.\r\n\r\nThe hostalero of Orotava had not deceived us, for the diamond was now\r\nbefore us, shining visibly.\r\n\r\nLike a star, it seemed to shrink and tremble while we gazed at it,\r\nwhich Hislop did, long and steadily.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Dick Rodney,\" said he, \"you have first seen the diamond, and\r\nshall have the largest share, if we get it.\"\r\n\r\nI laughed at this, and asked,--\r\n\r\n\"How does it shine thus in the dark?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the diamond is a gem possessing a greater refractive power\r\nthan any other precious stone, and reflects every atom of light which\r\nfalls upon it at an angle of incidence greater than twenty-four and a\r\nhalf degrees, even before being cut.  I remember that Benvenuto\r\nCellini, in his _History of Jewelry_, mentions a magnificently\r\ncolored carbuncle, which was found in a vineyard near Rome simply by\r\nits shining in the night.  Stand steadily where you are, Dick, and\r\ndon't lose sight of it, while I advance up the ravine.\"\r\n\r\nHe did so thrice, and each time found that on proceeding about twenty\r\nyards, it faded away altogether.\r\n\r\n\"It is very probably a mere rock crystal,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"No rock crystal ever shone with a brilliance like that!\" replied\r\nHislop, vehemently; \"but whether it is a diamond of the purest water\r\nor a will-o'-the-wisp--a spunkie, as we call it in Scotland--I'll\r\ngive it a touch with a short Enfield, point-blank.\"\r\n\r\nHislop's rifle was already capped and loaded, but with his knife he\r\nshaped an oblong bullet of the hard white chalk which he had procured\r\nat Orotava, and carefully rammed it down the barrel.\r\n\r\nHaving some matches about him, he touched the knob of the foresight\r\nand the _notch_ of the back-sight with phosphorus, and thus bringing\r\nthe two lights in a line with the diamond, he took a long and steady\r\naim from his left knee, and _fired_!\r\n\r\nThe dark valley and the steep mountains rang with a thousand\r\nreverberations, as they seemed to toss the sharp report from echoing\r\nrock to rock, until it died away in mid-air; but still the diamond\r\nshone as brightly as ever, and our horses plunged so wildly that they\r\nnearly broke away from us.\r\n\r\n\"If my aim is true, and the chalk bullet has struck the rock, it will\r\nindicate the bearings of the diamond, and we may unship it somehow in\r\nthe morning,\" said the practical Scotchman, as he quietly reloaded.\r\n\r\n\"Morning?  Must we wait here till then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Dick, it is worth waiting for; and after all we have gone\r\nthrough since that day when we picked you up adrift in the chops of\r\nthe Channel, we may sleep here pleasantly enough in one of the\r\nthickets.\"\r\n\r\nAfter lingering a little time and observing the strange sparkle, the\r\nactual origin of which we could scarcely realize, we found a thick\r\ngrove of laurels; and securing our horses to two branches by the\r\nbridles, we unstrapped from each the large coarse horse-cloth, which\r\nis frequently folded and placed under the saddle by riders in Spain\r\nand its colonies, and in these rugs we wrapped ourselves for warmth\r\nand protection from the dew and mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nThere we lay, each with a loaded rifle by his side, and his horse\r\npicketed near.  Sailor-like, Hislop went off to sleep at once, as\r\nsound as a timber-head; but for hours I found it impossible to follow\r\nso pleasant an example, and lay watching the light of the moon,\r\nwhich, as she rose higher in the sky, descended the vast side of the\r\nPeak of Teneriffe, and at last filled the volcanic ravine with a\r\nflood of liquid silver.\r\n\r\nThe loveliness of the night, the solemnity of the scenery, the lonely\r\nposition in which I found myself, and the strange errand on which we\r\nhad come, all conduced to fill me with contemplation and many\r\nthoughts that banished slumber.\r\n\r\nIn all the vast expanse of heaven, into which that wondrous peak\r\nascended to the height of more than twelve thousand feet, no cloud\r\nwas visible; but there were millions upon millions of stars,\r\nrivalling and almost eclipsing the splendor of the moon.\r\n\r\nThe silver light was poured aslant into the valley through every rent\r\nand fissure in the crags, causing masses of shadow between them;\r\nwhile the wild vines and the cocoa-nut trees were covered with\r\nprismatic gems as the dew gathered on their pendant leaves and fruit.\r\nSo splendid was the moonshine, and so mild was the atmosphere, that\r\nthe wild canaries, like golden birds in some fairy valley, were\r\ntwittering about us as if day had broken.\r\n\r\nAt last I grew weary and slept.\r\n\r\nWith the first peep of day Hislop roused me.  It was well to be up\r\nand doing before others, who might observe us, came out of the\r\nravine, though it had all the aspect of a lonely and unfrequented\r\nplace.  About two miles of the mountain peak were gilded by the yet\r\n(to us) unrisen sun; but in the valley there was only twilight when\r\nwe folded our rugs, saddled our horses, and proceeding to the stone\r\nwhich bore the name of Juan Hererro, went from thence in a straight\r\nline toward the rocky cliff, which closed in the end of the hollow,\r\nat the distance of somewhat more than fifty paces.\r\n\r\nWe reached a sloping bluff of rugged basalt, faced by strange\r\nlava-like columnar masses that might easily be dislodged by a\r\ncrowbar, and all were spotted by luxuriant lichens, which in the wet\r\nseason would ripen into velvety moss, while long green trailers,\r\ncovered with gorgeous wild-flowers grew in every cleft and chasm.\r\n\r\nThis rocky bluff was about sixty feet in height, and, by the\r\nincreasing light, Hislop scanned it with a keen nautical eye, that\r\nhad been accustomed to detect sight and signs in every state of the\r\natmosphere and elements.\r\n\r\nIn a minute or less an exclamation of satisfaction escaped him, and\r\npointing upward,--\r\n\r\n\"Dick,\", he added, \"do you see _that_?\"\r\n\r\nI looked in the direction indicated, and saw a small white star\r\nformed by the chalk bullet upon the face of the rock.\r\n\r\n\"I do,\" said I; \"I do!\"\r\n\r\n\"There or thereabout must be this diamond, which is never visible by\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we have neither hammer, chisel, nor crowbar,\" said I; \"and our\r\nfingers, I fear, won't avail us much.\"\r\n\r\nHislop threw the bridle of his horse over a laurel-bush; I did the\r\nsame; and in a few minutes we had climbed to the spot indicated by\r\nthe chalk mark; and there also we found the conical bullet of his\r\nEnfield rifle, flattened out like a florin, and adhering to the face\r\nof the rock.\r\n\r\nFor nearly twenty minutes we examined all the locality of these\r\nmarks, and at last I discovered something that appeared to be a dull\r\ngray piece of rock crystal, half sunk and half projecting from the\r\nface of the basalt, and led Hislop to it.\r\n\r\nUttering an exclamation of joy, he declared that, beyond a doubt, _it\r\nwas the diamond_!\r\n\r\nWe were almost breathless at this sudden discovery, and looked about\r\nus on every hand, like the perpetrators of a robbery, lest we might\r\nbe observed; but, except our horses cropping the grass, and the\r\ngolden canary birds that sang on every twig and tree, there appeared\r\nno living thing on the mountain above or in the ravine beneath us.\r\n\r\nBut how were we to extract our treasure, if a treasure indeed it was?\r\n\r\nVainly we used our knives, till the blades bent and broke; vainly we\r\npunched it with the butts and ramrods of our rifles.  It remained\r\nsolid, hard, fast, and immovable.\r\n\r\nHislop's aim had been a true one, under the circumstances, for the\r\ncrystal was situated just three inches from his shot-mark.\r\n\r\nAt last he, being fertile in resources, on finding a sloping rent in\r\nthe rock, about eight inches above the object of our solicitude\r\nbethought him of blowing it out by gunpowder.\r\n\r\nAll our cartridges, about thirty in number, were at once opened, and\r\ntheir contents rammed hard or pounded in, with a piece of stick and a\r\nstone in lieu of a mallet.  The rent was small, and seemed about a\r\nfoot deep.  This impromptu mining was a laborious affair, for it\r\nrequired to be carefully done, and occupied more than two hours, as\r\nwe had to plug up the aperture tightly, leaving only a very small\r\ntouchhole.\r\n\r\nWhen all was complete, some cigar fusees and wetted powder were\r\nprepared together as a slow-match; they were inserted and a light\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n\"Sheer off, Dick,--give it a wide berth!\" cried Hislop.\r\n\r\nThe fusee smoked as it consumed, but slowly, and breathlessly we\r\nlooked on, at ten yards' distance.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to die out, for the smoking ceased, and the last puff,\r\nafter curling among the green trailers passed away.\r\n\r\nHislop was about to ascend and to examine the powder, when there was\r\na loud and sharp explosion; a little cloud of dust rose, and\r\ndisengaged from the cliff some fragments of rock, six in number,\r\nabout the size of half bricks, fell on the bank below.\r\n\r\nUttering a shout, we rushed down, and in a moment Hislop found the\r\ndiamond adhering to a piece of stone larger than itself!\r\n\r\nSome time elapsed before we could fully realize our good fortune or\r\nbelieve in the wealth we had so suddenly acquired.\r\n\r\nIt seemed like a mere lump of rock crystal, but larger than a\r\ngoose-egg, and not unlike the Koh-i-Noor--the fabled Light of the\r\nWorld--that mysterious palladium of the destinies of India, before it\r\nwas cut, polished, and in some degree mutilated, that it might figure\r\nin the Exhibition of 1851--as ours may do, perhaps, in that of 1871.\r\n\r\nTime will show.\r\n\r\nIf a pure diamond, this stone was worth nearly seventy thousand\r\npounds!\r\n\r\n\"Let us keep our own counsel, Dick, about this, till we find\r\nourselves in London,\" said Hislop, as he consigned it to his\r\nbreast-pocket, together with the piece of stone which adhered to it;\r\n\"and now we must make a good offing while all is quiet here.\"\r\n\r\nIn a minute more, and just as a group of horsemen--farmers and\r\nsugar-millers--entered the valley, we had mounted, and were galloping\r\ntoward Santa Cruz as fast as our horses' heels could carry us.*\r\n\r\n\r\n* By a note from Hislop, he informs me that the idea of marking with\r\na chalk bullet the locality of the diamond was given him by an old\r\nScottish legend which he heard, of a precious stone, of great size,\r\nthat shone, but by night only, amid the rocks on the beautiful hill\r\nof Kinnoul.  There it had long tantalized the citizens of Perth, till\r\nan ingenious fellow fired a ball of camstone at it, and by thus\r\nmarking the place picked the gem out at his leisure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LAST OF ANTONIO EL CUBANO.\r\n\r\nAs we entered Santa Cruz we found a great crowd of colonists,\r\ncitizens, mulattoes, Creoles, and negroes, all in motley and\r\ngaudily-striped linen jackets and trousers, assembled in the Plaza,\r\nwhere a guard of Spanish infantry, with muskets shouldered and\r\nbayonets fixed, kept back the people in the form of a hollow square,\r\nabout a raised wooden platform, which was covered with black cloth,\r\nand whereon was placed the garotte.\r\n\r\n\"What is all this about?\" we asked.\r\n\r\n\"It is for the execution of Antonio, a Cuban pirate, who is to die by\r\nthe _garotte_,\" replied a soldier.\r\n\r\nThis instrument of the law was simply an upright wooden post rising\r\nfrom the platform.  At its base was a low stool, on which the\r\ncondemned are seated; and about three feet above that appears an iron\r\nring with a handle and screw, by the compression of which they are\r\nstrangled, instantly or slowly, according to sentence.\r\n\r\nThe crowd was very impatient; the hour at which the grim scene was to\r\nhave taken place was now long past.  Loud murmurs rose from the\r\npeople, who had heard most exaggerated stories of Antonio's stature,\r\nstrength, and ferocity, and glances of anger and impatience were\r\ndarted at the gilt dial of the town-house, on which a black banner\r\nwas hoisted but half-mast high.\r\n\r\nWe recognized nearly all the crew of the _San Ildefonso_ in front of\r\nthe mob; and there, too, were a number of British sailors of H.M.'s\r\nsteam sloop-of-war _Active_, which had anchored in the harbor that\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nSeveral priests in long gray robes were hurrying to and fro, begging\r\na \"peseta\" to pay for masses for the soul of the condemned man.\r\n\r\nAs neither Hislop nor I had any desire to witness a scene so\r\nbarbarous and revolting as an execution, we hastened to our posada to\r\nbreakfast, where we were joined by Captain José Estremera, who had\r\njust come from the Castle of Santa Cruz, where the culprit was\r\nconfined, and where a most extraordinary scene had taken place.\r\n\r\nThe little Spanish skipper was quite excited; his black eyes were\r\nround as saucers; his olive cheek was flushed crimson; and he spoke\r\nso fast and said so much that he nearly choked himself over his eggs\r\nand scalding-hot coffee.\r\n\r\nHis narrative was as follows, and it presented a singular instance of\r\nmad ferocity, of cowardice, and despair.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, probably about the same time that Hislop and I were\r\nbusy with our diamond, the bastonero, or turnkey, of the Castle of\r\nSanta Cruz, which is at once a prison, a barrack, and fortress,\r\nopened the door of Antonio's cell to announce to him, in the usual\r\nform, that Senor the Judge of the First Instance, accompanied by an\r\nEscribano of the Court, had arrived to read over his sentence again,\r\nand to convey him to the Chapel of the Doomed, where Fra Anselmo\r\nwould confer and pray with him prior to his execution.\r\n\r\nOn entering, the bastonero found Antonio whistling cheerfully, and\r\ndeliberately using a sharp file, which he had procured no one knew\r\nhow, but with the aid of which, he had released one of his ankles\r\nfrom the fetterlocks, by which his feet had been secured to a\r\nponderous iron bar that traversed his cell.  But though still held\r\nfast by one leg, he flung himself bodily, like a wild animal, on the\r\nunsuspecting bastonero, tore the heavy keys from his leather girdle,\r\nand after dealing him a deadly blow on the head, dashed him, bleeding\r\nand senseless, against the wall outside the cell door.\r\n\r\nHe then closed the latter, locked it on the inside, and resumed the\r\nuse of the file, which was heard rasping on the steel, while he sang\r\nhis favorite \"Companero, companero,\" &c.\r\n\r\nAware that the crowd were waiting in the Plaza, and that Spanish\r\ncrowds were not to be trifled with, in vain did the commandant of the\r\nCastle of Santa Cruz, the judge, the escribano, and Fra Anselmo\r\nentreat Antonio to cease his fruitless resistance, as his fate was\r\nsealed now beyond the reach of pardon even from the captain-general.\r\n\r\nResolved to die as he had lived, like a tiger, Antonio fiercely\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nThe priest next implored him to pass the keys through the iron\r\ngrating in the cell door.\r\n\r\nHe uttered a shout of laughter.\r\n\r\nThe armorer of the castle was now summoned to force the lock; but the\r\nmechanism of it resisted all his strength and skill.  Senor the\r\ncommandant was furious!\r\n\r\nThe pioneers of the garrison were next ordered in with their iron\r\ncrowbars and sledge-hammers to beat down the door.\r\n\r\nIt was small but enormously thick, being built of bars of oak and\r\niron bolted together, and curiously inserted in a groove formed in\r\nthe massive wall of the old castle.\r\n\r\nFor an hour they toiled at it, and in the intervals of their labor\r\nthe sound of Antonio's file was heard at work, together with his\r\nmaledictions, his songs, and fierce derisive laughter.\r\n\r\n\"Ho! ho! my fine fellow,\" said the Commandant, rattling his sabre,\r\n\"we shall soon see the end of this fine game!\"\r\n\r\nAt last the door fell in fragments, but unfortunately one strong iron\r\nbar still remained across the aperture; the daylight streamed into\r\nthe vault, and now, like a baited wild beast, Antonio, who was still\r\nfettered to the iron bar, dragged himself toward the doorway, armed\r\nwith the large key, which was about a foot long.\r\n\r\nWhen another bastonero attempted to enter by stooping, a blow from\r\nthe key fell like a thunderbolt upon his defenceless head, and he was\r\ndragged out by the heels, apparently in a dying state.\r\n\r\nSeveral others who ventured in met with the same fate; the whole\r\nplace became splashed with blood; the consternation increased, and\r\nthe authorities were at their wits' end, for the doorway was so small\r\nthat one person alone could enter at a time, and then only when\r\nstooping low,--a position which placed them completely at the mercy\r\nof Antonio.\r\n\r\nFor another hour did that frenzied ruffian keep all at bay, replying\r\nto the threats of the Commandant, the entreaties of Fra Anselmo, and\r\nthe suave legal rhetoric of the Judge of the First Instance with\r\nlaughter and derision.\r\n\r\nTired at last of wielding his large key, or finding that none would\r\ncome within reach of it, he flung it at the group outside, and broke\r\nthe nether jaw of the escribano, who left the field of battle with\r\ngreat precipitation.\r\n\r\nThe commandant now summoned a party of soldiers, and twelve men of\r\nthe castle guard came, under the orders of the lieutenant, Don Luiz\r\nPineda, who at once ordered them to load with ball-cartridge.\r\n\r\nOn seeing these dire preparations, which he could no longer\r\nwithstand, Antonio ceased in his untimely ribaldry.  Great drops of\r\nperspiration poured over his low but narrow temples.  His dark brow\r\nwas furrowed deeper, as if by baffled rage and futile ferocity; his\r\nblack eyes glistened with a fearful glare, and his vast bulky form\r\nseemed to dilate in muscular strength and size; the blue pallor of\r\ndeath passed over his thin and cruel lips, but still they were\r\nwrithed by a mocking smile.\r\n\r\n\"Senor Don Luiz,\" said Fra Anselmo, \"I entreat you not to have him\r\nshot dead----\"\r\n\r\n\"What then, Senor Padre?\"\r\n\r\n\"But merely wounded, that he may have time for repentance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Buena,--then wounded he shall be.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment Antonio struck the young lieutenant on the face, by\r\nhurling the file at him, and inflicted a severe wound.\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\" cried Pineda, mad with rage.\r\n\r\nA musket was levelled and fired; and while the vaults of the castle\r\nrang with a hundred echoes the loud laugh of Antonio was heard.  He\r\nhad crawled along the iron bar into a dark corner of his prison,\r\nwhere, coiled up at the extreme length of his chain, he escaped the\r\nbullet, which was flattened on the masonry.\r\n\r\nAgain and again the soldiers fired in succession, but missed him, and\r\nthe vault became full of smoke.\r\n\r\n\"Basta!\" said they; \"what is the use of wasting powder on a picaroon\r\nwho is bullet-proof?\"\r\n\r\nPineda now took a musket, and aiming very deliberately, fired.  Then\r\nAntonio's chain was heard to rattle as he sprang from the iron bar\r\nwith a wild bound, for the ball had broken his right thigh-bone.\r\n\r\nNow he howled, bellowed, and literally foamed at the mouth, as he\r\nrolled about on the floor, encumbered by his iron chain, his broken\r\nleg, and fettered foot.  Two other shots were fired; by one an arm\r\nwas broken, and by the other a collar-bone.  On this he lay still,\r\nand called out in a husky voice,--\r\n\r\n\"Senores, I surrender--have mercy!\"\r\n\r\nThen the pioneers rushed in and dragged him out.  But the spirit of\r\nthe fiend was yet strong within him, for as he was borne past Don\r\nLuiz, bleeding from three wounds, he clenched the hand which yet\r\nretained power, and struck him a violent blow.\r\n\r\nOn that instant the sword of the fiery young lieutenant would have\r\nbeen passed through his heart, had not Fra Anselmo arrested the blade\r\nby grasping it.\r\n\r\nJust as José Estremera had reached this point in his narrative of the\r\nmorning's proceedings, we heard a tremendous hubbub, and on hurrying\r\nto the front windows of the posada, saw a vast crowd running after a\r\nlow hurdle that was drawn by two mules past the end of the street\r\nwhich led straight toward the great Plaza.\r\n\r\nIt bore the miserable and half-dead form of Antonio el Cubano to the\r\nfinal scene of his crimes and recent sufferings,--_the garotte_.\r\n\r\nSo perished this sinner!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nI have but little more to add, for with this last episode the course\r\nof wild adventures upon which I had been so strangely hurried, nearly\r\ncloses.\r\n\r\nA few hours after the death of Antonio, when Hislop and I, with\r\nLambourne, Carlton, and other survivors of the _Eugenie_ were waiting\r\nin the office of the British Consul to make some arrangements for\r\nrewarding José Estremera for his great kindness to us all, we met\r\nCaptain the Hon. Egerton B----, of H.M. ship _Active_, who was so\r\nstruck with our story that he offered us all a passage to England, an\r\noffer which we accepted with gratitude.\r\n\r\nHis ship was leaving the African squadron, and returning home to be\r\nrepaired.\r\n\r\n\"Rodney--Rodney,\" said he, ponderingly, when the Consul introduced\r\nme; \"you ought to have been a sailor, for your name is well known in\r\nthe service;\" and his words brought the memory of my poor mother's\r\nambition back to me, and I thought of the old picture which hung in\r\nthe dining-room at home.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief conference with his shipmates Tattooed Tom now came\r\nforward, and twirling his fragment of a hat, said that \"if the noble\r\ncaptain had no objection, as he, Ned Carlton, Probart, and the other\r\npoor fellows of the _Eugenie_ were out of a berth, and at uncommon\r\nlow water, they would gladly ship aboard the _Active_, and enter her\r\nMajesty's service.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain B----, who saw at a glance that they were all first-class\r\nseamen, readily accepted the offer, and promised them the usual\r\nbounty; on which they gave three loud cheers for the Queen, and it\r\ncame from their throats not the less heartily that they were far away\r\nfrom her and in a foreign land, all tattered as they were, with\r\nscarcely a shirt to their backs.\r\n\r\n\"Heaven bless you, my lads,\" said Hislop; \"this is the best thing you\r\ncan do; and believe me, Captain B----, you will find my old shipmates\r\nneither waisters nor green-hands, but thorough A.B.'s.\"\r\n\r\nAs they all loved him, another cheer for Hislop followed, and while\r\nthe captain went off to the _Active_ in his gig, we all adjourned to\r\na posada to have a last friendly glass together.\r\n\r\nSoon after, as the war steamer was to sail that evening, a boat under\r\na midshipman came off for us, and then we bade farewell to José\r\nEstremera, to his mate, Manuel Gautier, to Fra Anselmo, and the old\r\nGovernor of Surabaya.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Dick--we have no time to lose,\" said Hislop; \"let us be off to\r\nthe ship while daylight lasts; these fellows in Teneriffe haven't\r\nmissed their diamond yet!\"\r\n\r\nI shall never forget my emotions of joy when the boat with Hislop and\r\nthe rest of us came sheering alongside the _Active_.\r\n\r\nShe was so clean, so trig, so square aloft; with the bright copper\r\ngleaming in the water below; her black bulwarks and red portholes,\r\nthrough which her sixty-eights and thirty-twos peered above the\r\nbrine; the snow-white hammock cloths, with the gold epaulets of the\r\nlieutenant of the watch glittering above them; the red-coated marines\r\non her poop and forecastle; the great scarlet ensign of \"Old England\"\r\nfloating at the gaff-peak:--and that no part of the illusion might be\r\nwanting, a little marine fifer, playing shrilly but sweetly \"Home,\r\nsweet home,\" in one of the boats that lay alongside by the guess-warp\r\nboom.\r\n\r\nShe was so thoroughly British in her aspect, so unlike any thing we\r\nhad seen in the seas we had traversed, that we felt _at home_ the\r\nmoment our feet were on her deck of good old English oak--ay, as much\r\nat home as if we stood upon the chalky South Foreland, and saw the\r\ngreen hop-fields of fertile Kent at our feet, with the gray towers of\r\nDover and the white spires of Deal in the distance.  Old Lambourne\r\nuttered a shout, and pointed to the Union Jack.\r\n\r\nOne must be abroad and far away to feel to the full the emotions that\r\nare excited, and the confidence which is inspired on seeing the old\r\nflag, that has swept every sea and shore, waving in its pride from\r\nthe gaff-peak of a British man-of-war!\r\n\r\nIt is then that we feel \"what a sway _one little island_ has\r\nexercised over this mighty earth.\"\r\n\r\nHislop and I dined with Captain B----, who was anxious to hear our\r\nstory in detail.\r\n\r\nOur shipmates were told off to their several divisions, and we were\r\nplaced in the ward-room mess for the remainder of the voyage.\r\n\r\nWe sailed that night, and under steam and canvas, as we bore away to\r\nthe north, we soon saw the Peak of Adam sinking into the dark blue\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\"Adieu to the Canaries,\" said Hislop, waving his hat; \"the next shore\r\nwe see will be Europe,--the white cliffs of Old England, perhaps.\"\r\n\r\nBut next day we sighted the great pitons of the Salvage Islands, a\r\ngroup of uninhabited rocks which are claimed by the Portuguese\r\n(perhaps because no one else cares about them), and which are\r\nsurrounded by dangerous shoals.  One of these isles closely resembles\r\nthe fantastic rocks of the Needles, at the west end of the Isle of\r\nWight.\r\n\r\nOn the Salvages the canary birds are so numerous, that an old voyager\r\nsays, \"it is impossible to walk without crushing their eggs.\"\r\n\r\nWe touched at Madeira, and after a delightful voyage of about sixteen\r\ndays, ran up the Channel, and came to anchor in the Downs on the 20th\r\nof October.\r\n\r\n* * * * *\r\n\r\nI had been absent from home more than a year, when I found myself in\r\nLondon--in mighty London, with its dark forests of masts and its\r\ndarker cathedral dome, that meets the eye from every point of\r\nview:--a wondrous and bewildering change, after traversing so long\r\nthe wide and lonely sea!\r\n\r\nWith a heart swollen by anxiety to learn tidings of my father, my\r\nmother, and sisters, I reached the counting-house of my uncle's firm,\r\nRodney and Co., in the city, but there was something so peculiar in\r\nmy aspect, which pertained neither to sea nor shore, and was\r\nunmistakably outlandish, that old John Thomas, the porter, seemed\r\ninclined to shut the door in my face.\r\n\r\nA short explanation, however, soon overcame his scruples, and I was\r\nthen admitted.\r\n\r\nMy uncle was at Erlesmere; but his head clerk assured me that my\r\nfamily were all well, though they had long since given me up for\r\ndead, as a handsome (he assured me it was very handsome) white marble\r\ntablet erected to my memory in the Rectory church remained to testify.\r\n\r\nMy letters from Cuba had never reached home!\r\n\r\nAs I had no desire to shock my parents by a sudden surprise, a\r\ntelegram preceded me, and in less than an hour I was off by the\r\nexpress-train for Erlesmere.  But with all its speed, the express\r\nseemed too slow for me.  Marc Hislop accompanied me until he could\r\nget a ship; but before looking for that he meant to visit his old\r\nmother, who lived somewhere in Scotland.\r\n\r\nAfter all that we had undergone, all that I had to show my family\r\nwere the sword and old book found in the water-logged brig, the\r\ncreese of a mutinous Lascar, the ring given me by the Governor of\r\nSurabaya, and though mentioned last not esteemed the least, our\r\ndiamond, of which Marc Hislop and I have not yet ascertained the\r\nvalue, or I should rather say its proper claim to the designation of\r\na diamond.\r\n\r\nFor Marc Hislop's sake, more than my own, I trust that our sanguine\r\nexpectations may be realized, and that it may, at all events, furnish\r\nhim, out of his share of the prize, with the means of providing\r\ncomfortably for the mother who so admirably trained him up to a love\r\nof knowledge and to a sense of duty.\r\n\r\nI have now realized the truth of Goethe's maxim: \"He that looks\r\nforward sees one way to pursue; but _he who looks backward sees\r\nmany_.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so, tempered by a year of adversity, enlightened by its\r\nexperience and suffering, I have returned, more than ever determined\r\nto make up for lost time, and to work my way manfully to King's\r\nCollege, Cambridge; after which, the reader who has accompanied me so\r\nfar, may perhaps hear of me again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
