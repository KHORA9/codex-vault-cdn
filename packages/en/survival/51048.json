In\r\nthe 1930’s virtually all the vast canyon country between Moab, Utah, and\r\nGrand Canyon, Ariz., was studied for a projected Escalante National\r\nPark. But Escalante failed to get off the ground, even when a second\r\nattempt was made in the 1950’s. Not until another proposal had been made\r\nand legislative compromises had been worked out did the park\r\nmaterialize, this time under a new name—Canyonlands. Among the many\r\ndignitaries who witnessed the signature on September 12 was one of the\r\nmen most responsible for the park’s creation, park superintendent Bates\r\nE. Wilson, who did the pioneer spade work in the field.\r\n\r\nThe newborn park covered 400 square miles[1] at the junction of the\r\nGreen and Colorado Rivers in Utah. It included such magnificent features\r\nas Island in the Sky, The Needles, Upheaval Dome, and the two great\r\nstone formations, Angel Arch and Druid Arch. On November 16, 1971,\r\nPresident Richard M. Nixon signed an act of Congress enlarging the park\r\nby 125 square miles in four separate parcels of land, so the area now\r\ntotals 525 square miles, all in southeastern Utah, as shown on the map\r\n(fig. 1). The northern boundary was extended to include parts of Taylor\r\nand Shafer Canyons. The addition at the southeast corner takes in the\r\nheadwaters of Salt and Lavender Canyons and part of Davis’ Canyon. The\r\nlargest addition, at the southwest corner, includes grotesquely carved\r\nareas bearing such colorful names as The Maze, Land of Standing Rocks,\r\nThe Fins, The Doll House (fig. 36), and Ernies Country (named after\r\nErnie Larson, an early-day sheepman). The fourth parcel lies about 8\r\nmiles west of the northwest corner and encompasses much of Horseshoe\r\nCanyon, whose walls are adorned by striking pictographs (fig. 2).\r\n\r\nAt this writing (1973) the park is still in its infancy, with most of\r\nthe planned developments and improvements awaiting time and money, but a\r\ngood start has been made. In 1960 my family and I first traversed Island\r\nin the Sky to Grand View Point over a rough jeep trail; now it is\r\nreached with ease over a good graded road which eventually will be\r\npaved. A temporary trailer-housed entrance station near The Neck will be\r\nreplaced by permanent headquarters for the Island in the Sky district\r\nafter water is piped up from wells drilled near the mouth of Taylor\r\nCanyon.\r\n\r\nIn August 1965, when the Park was but 11 months old, we drove the family\r\ncar over a two-track dirt “road” from Dugout Ranch to Cave\r\nSpring—temporary headquarters for the Needles district of the park,\r\nwhose personnel were housed partly in trailers and partly in the cave.\r\nNow a modern paved highway, built by the State (Utah Highway 11) for 19\r\nmiles to Dugout Ranch and by San Juan County, the State of Utah, and the\r\nNational Park Service for the next 18 miles, extends a total of 38 miles\r\nfrom U.S. Highway 163 to a new modern campground at Squaw Flat (fig.\r\n39). The entrance station and housing for park personnel are now in\r\ntrailers about 2 miles west of Cave Spring, but the trailers will be\r\nreplaced by permanent structures. A shallow well near temporary\r\nheadquarters supplies the only water available to the campground 1.5\r\nmiles to the west, but a new supply is to be developed for the\r\ncampground and permanent headquarters. Groceries, gasoline, trailer\r\nhookups, and charter flights are available at Canyonlands Resort, just\r\noutside the eastern park boundary. The old cowboy line camp at Cave\r\nSpring has been restored so that visitors can see this phase of colorful\r\nCanyonlands history (fig. 6). Except for 2½ miles of partly graded road\r\nwest from Squaw Flat, all travel to the west and south is by\r\nfour-wheel-drive vehicle or on foot. In order to reach the confluence of\r\nthe Green and Colorado Rivers, The Grabens, and Chesler and Virginia\r\nParks, drivers must conquer formidable Elephant Hill, with its 40\r\npercent grades and backup switchbacks. SOB Hill and the Silver Stairs\r\nalso tax the skill and patience of jeepsters. Parts of this area will\r\neventually be reached by graded roads, possibly by about 1977, but many\r\nhope that much of it will be kept accessible only by jeep or foot\r\ntrails.\r\n\r\nBates Wilson, recently retired superintendent not only of Canyonlands\r\nNational Park but also of nearby Arches National Park and of Natural\r\nBridges National Monument about 80 miles to the south, is one of the few\r\nmen in the park service who has guided a national park through all\r\nphases—location, promotion, establishment, and initial development. He\r\nretired in June 1972 to a ranch along the Colorado River north of Moab.\r\n\r\nUnless credited to others, for which grateful acknowledgment is made,\r\nthe color photographs were taken by me. Most of these were taken on 4-\r\nby 5-inch film in a tripod-mounted press camera using lenses of several\r\nfocal lengths, but a few were taken on 35-millimeter film. Unless\r\ncredited to others, the black and white photographs were kindly loaned\r\nfrom the Moab and Arches files of the National Park Service. The points\r\nfrom which most of the photographs were taken are shown in figure 19.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor Powell’s River Expeditions\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Major John Wesley Powell was not the first geologist to view\r\nthe canyon lands, his two daring boat trips down the Green and Colorado\r\nRivers in 1869 and 1871 made history by bringing to light the first\r\ndescriptions of the geography and geology of what was then the largest\r\nremaining uncharted wilderness in the United States. Many landmarks\r\nalong the canyons in the park were named by Powell and his men during\r\nthose explorations. J. S. Newberry is thought to have been the first\r\ngeologist to view the canyon lands—at least he seems to have been the\r\nfirst one whose observations were recorded (1861), but the more\r\ncomprehensive findings of Powell (1875) were the ones that made history.\r\n\r\nThe 100th anniversary of Major Powell’s pioneer exploration of the Green\r\nand Colorado Rivers was commemorated in 1969 by a national centennial\r\nsponsored jointly by the U.S. Department of the Interior, the\r\nSmithsonian Institution, the National Geographic Society, and many other\r\norganizations. This touched off many magazine and newspaper articles,\r\nseveral commemorative programs and dedications, and several publications\r\nof lasting interest. Noteworthy among the latter is U.S. Geological\r\nSurvey Professional Paper 669 entitled “The Colorado River Region and\r\nJohn Wesley Powell.” Of its four separate parts, two are of special\r\ninterest to our Canyonlands story: part A, “John Wesley Powell: Pioneer\r\nStatesman of Federal Science,” by Rabbitt (1969) and part C, “Geologic\r\nHistory of the Colorado River,” by Hunt (1969). An interesting history\r\nof the National Park Service by Everhart (1972) was published as part of\r\nthe national park centennial effort. The Powell Society, Ltd., of\r\nDenver, Colo., was founded mainly to publish four “River Runners’ Guides\r\nto the Canyons of the Green and Colorado Rivers, with Emphasis on\r\nGeologic Features,” covering five reaches of the two rivers from Flaming\r\nGorge Dam, Utah, to Grand Canyon, Ariz. One of these by Mutschler (1969)\r\ncovers Labyrinth, Stillwater, and Cataract Canyons, all in Canyonlands\r\nNational Park. Another guidebook by Baars and Molenaar (1971) covers the\r\nColorado River from about Potash, Utah, to the confluence with the\r\nGreen, and Cataract Canyon. It is difficult to realize that thousands of\r\npeople annually now boat down the canyons Powell dared to explore\r\nwithout knowledge of the dangers that lay ahead.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1968 a U.S. Geological Survey expedition led by\r\nEugene M. Shoemaker retraced the historic 1869 and 1871 river voyages of\r\nMajor Powell, in order to reoccupy the camera stations of the 1871\r\nvoyage and rephotograph the same scenes nearly 100 years later.\r\nRemarkably enough, about 150 camera stations were recovered, many\r\nrequiring considerable search, and official photographer Hal G. Stephens\r\nrephotographed the scenes taken with cumbersome wet-plate cameras nearly\r\n100 years earlier by E. O. Beaman (above the site of Lees Ferry) and by\r\nJ. K. Hillers (below the site). A report containing these remarkable\r\nsets of before and after photographs hopefully will be published\r\neventually as a delayed part of the Powell centennial. A few pairs have\r\nbeen published by others (Baars and Molenaar, 1971, p. 90-99), and two\r\npairs are shown herein as figures 62 and 67. As these photographs show,\r\nin most places the rocks and even the vegetation remain virtually\r\nunchanged after nearly a century, but a few other pairs not included\r\nherein show catastrophic changes resulting from local floods or\r\nrockfalls.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK, showing location in Utah,\r\n    Lake Powell, Dead Horse Point State Park, boundaries, streams,\r\n    roads, trails, landforms, and principal named features. There was\r\n    insufficient room to show all named features; some not shown are\r\n    related in text by distance and direction to named ones, and some\r\n    additional names are given in figures 7, 51, and 59.

Visitors also can obtain pamphlets at\r\n    the entrance stations to the Needles and Island in the Sky districts\r\n    of the park or at the National Park Service office in Moab; these\r\n    contain up-to-date maps of the park and the latest available\r\n    information on roads, trails, campsites, and picnic sites. (Fig. 1)]\r\n\r\nOn June 26, 1969, state and local officials met along the Green River at\r\nthe mouth of Split Mountain Canyon, in Dinosaur National Monument, to\r\ndedicate a monument to Major Powell, commemorating the 100th anniversary\r\nof his first river trip, and to dedicate the Powell Centennial Scenic\r\nDrive, also known as the Powell Memorial Highway. In the absence of any\r\nroads closely paralleling the Green and Colorado Rivers except for short\r\ndistances, this route is virtually the only means of approach to the\r\nrivers and comprises parts of several state and federal highways\r\nconnecting Green River, Wyo., and Grand Canyon, Ariz. A segment of it,\r\nU.S. Highway 163, connects Crescent Junction, Moab, Monticello, and\r\nBlanding, all in Utah, and provides the principal access routes to\r\nCanyonlands and Arches National Parks and Natural Bridges National\r\nMonument.\r\n\r\nThe ceremonies at the mouth of Split Mountain Canyon began with the\r\nlanding of the official party flotilla of four boats similar to the ones\r\nused 100 years earlier by Powell, who was impersonated by a bearded man\r\ndressed to resemble the one-armed major. After the dedication, the four\r\nboats resumed the voyage down the Green River for another ceremony.\r\n\r\nOn June 29 a second monument was dedicated at the head of Desolation\r\nCanyon, some 50 miles southwest of Vernal, Utah, where the 1869 Powell\r\nexpedition first ventured into the then unknown wilderness. The bronze\r\nplaque identifies Desolation Canyon, named by Powell, as a national\r\nhistoric landmark that comprises 58,000 acres in an area 1 mile wide on\r\neach side of a 95-mile reach of the Green River.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly History\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Prehistoric people\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that the canyon lands were inhabited by cliff\r\ndwellers centuries before the explorations of Powell or the earlier\r\nvisits of the Spanish explorers and the fur trappers. Projectile points\r\nand other artifacts found in the nearby La Sal and Abajo Mountains\r\nindicate occupation by aborigines from about 3,000-2,000 B.C. to about 1\r\nA.D. (Hunt, 1956).\r\n\r\nArcheologists have found evidence of two occupations by prehistoric\r\npeoples in and near Canyonlands National Park—the Fremont people around\r\n850 or 900 A.D. and the Pueblo or Anasazi people from about 1075 to\r\ntheir departure in the late 12th century (Jennings, 1970). Within the\r\npark, the most densely populated area was along Salt Canyon and its\r\ntributaries in the Needles district, but many prehistoric dwellings and\r\ngranaries are also found just south of the park in Beef Basin and Ruin\r\nPark.\r\n\r\nThe Fremont people, who were mainly hunters, seemingly left no\r\nartifacts, but they did leave beautiful pictographs, or rock paintings,\r\nsuch as the group of ghostly human figures on the sandstone wall of\r\nHorseshoe Canyon (fig. 2), in the detached unit northwest of the park\r\nproper (fig. 1). The All American Man (fig. 3), a most unusual “Humpty\r\nDumpty” figure painted in red, white, and blue on the wall of a cave\r\nabout 3⅓ miles above the cable across the east fork of Salt Canyon, is\r\nbelieved to have been done in the Fremont style, but as shown in the\r\nphotograph, it is next to one of three dwellings in the same cave that\r\nwere built later by the Anasazi people. Tower Ruin (fig. 4) is one of\r\nmany well-preserved granaries built by the Anasazi, who farmed the flood\r\nplains of creeks such as Salt and Horse Canyons. According to Jennings\r\n(1970),\r\n\r\n  There is some evidence that these early Utah people practiced a form\r\n  of irrigation, using shallow ditches to carry water to their crops.\r\n  There is also evidence that a change in climate sometime around the\r\n  late 12th century brought about summer flash flooding and induced the\r\n  cliff dwellers to abandon their Canyonlands homes and farms.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PICTOGRAPHS ON WALL OF HORSESHOE CANYON, believed to\r\n    have been made by Fremont people about 1,000 years ago.

(Fig. 4)]\r\n\r\nVisitors to the Needles district pass through Indian Creek State Park 12\r\nmiles west of U.S. Highway 163. The principal attraction, which is\r\nvisible at the base of the Wingate Sandstone cliff on the right (north),\r\nis Newspaper Rock (fig. 5), one of the best preserved and most\r\nintriguing petroglyphs, or rock inscriptions, in the canyon lands. Many\r\nof the older cliff faces of the Wingate and Navajo Sandstones are\r\ndarkened or blackened by desert varnish, a natural pigment of iron and\r\nmanganese oxides. The prehistoric inhabitants of the canyon country\r\nlearned that effective and enduring designs could be created simply by\r\nchiseling through the thin dark layer to reveal the buff or tan\r\nsandstone beneath. According to Jesse D. Jennings (letter of Mar. 20,\r\n1962, to Utah Div. Parks and Recreation),\r\n\r\n  There are at least three periods of workmanship visible on the rock.\r\n  The last is quite recent since it shows men mounted on horses [brought\r\n  in by Spanish explorers]. These are probably less than 200 years old\r\n  and are probably the work of Ute tribesmen. The others cannot be\r\n  identified with any specific cultural group, although the earliest may\r\n  be as much as one thousand years old and are probably the work of the\r\n  so-called “Fremont” peoples * * *\r\n\r\nIn addition to the designs by the Fremont, Anasazi, and Ute artists, you\r\nwill note a few names and dates as late as 1954.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NEWSPAPER ROCK, petroglyphs cut in Wingate Sandstone\r\n    cliff in Indian Creek State Park. Inscriptions probably span about\r\n    1,000 years and include figures by Fremont, Anasazi, and Ute people\r\n    (mounted horsemen) and by a few early white settlers. (Fig. 5)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Late arrivals\r\n\r\nThe modern history of Canyonlands is as colorful as the canyons\r\nthemselves, and involves Indians, cattlemen, bank robbers, cattle\r\nrustlers, and horsethieves, followed by oil drillers, uranium hunters,\r\npotash miners, jeepsters, boaters, and tourists. A brief summary of\r\ntheir activities is taken mainly from a recent account by Maxine Newell\r\n(1970), to whose work you are referred for further details.\r\n\r\nBands of Ute and Navajo Indians roamed the canyons and mesas until the\r\nlate 1800’s, but gradually they were driven out and succeeded by pioneer\r\ncattlemen, the first of whom were George and Silas Green in 1874-75,\r\nfollowed by the Taylor brothers in 1880-81. Cowboys named many of the\r\nnatural features of the area, and the Needles country provided the\r\nscenic background for some of Zane Grey’s western tales and for David\r\nLavender’s “One Man’s West.” Lavender Canyon, whose headwaters were\r\nrecently annexed to the park, was named for him. Visitors to the Needles\r\ndistrict pass the Dugout Ranch about 7 miles northwest of Newspaper\r\nRock. The earliest ranch dwellings were dirt houses built by the\r\nSomerville and Scorup brothers, who bought the huge Indian Creek spread\r\nfor $426,000 from the Carlisle Co. in 1918. In 1973 the ranch was\r\noperated by Robert and Heidi Redd, whose line camp at Cave Spring served\r\nas temporary park headquarters and later was restored to a typical line\r\ncamp (fig. 6) as part of the Cave Spring Environmental Trail.\r\n\r\nRobbers Roost Canyon and Spring some 30 miles west of the park was the\r\nhangout of a horsethief named Cap Brown in the seventies. From 1884\r\nuntil about 1900 it was the hiding place for the notorious Butch Cassidy\r\nand his Wild Bunch, who robbed banks, trains, and mine payrolls and\r\nstole or traded horses and cattle from the ranchers. Cassidy and his\r\ngang managed to get along with the cattlemen by either replacing or\r\npaying for most of the horses and cattle, but the law finally drove them\r\nout, and Butch, the Sundance Kid, and a woman named Etta Place moved to\r\nBolivia. According to the movie version, Butch and the Sundance Kid were\r\nhunted down and shot by Bolivian soldiers for robbing banks and mine\r\npayrolls, but according to Baker (1971) Butch returned safely to the\r\nUnited States and died in the Northwest in 1943 or 1944, and the\r\nSundance Kid is reported to have died in Casper, Wyo., in 1958 at age\r\n98. Art Ekker (Findley, 1971, fig. 3), present owner of Robbers Roost\r\nRanch, which contains the former hangout, commented: “A lot of people\r\nare sure that Butch and his gang buried some money around Robbers Roost.\r\nEvery so often somebody turns up with a map or a metal detector and\r\nwants to start digging. They’ve found a lot of rusty tin cans and old\r\nhorseshoes.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CAVE SPRING LINE CAMP. Above, line-camp exterior,\r\n    showing entrance and corral; below, interior, showing furnishings\r\n    and staple food items kept in stock. Served as regular cowboy line\r\n    camp for many years, then as part of temporary park headquarters;\r\n    later restored as part of Cave Spring Environmental Trail. A nearby\r\n    cave, also in Cedar Mesa Sandstone, contains a spring. (Fig. 6)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 6, lower image]\r\n\r\nThe uranium boom of the 1950’s, touched off by Charlie Steen’s fabulous\r\nMi Vida mine south of La Sal, Utah, temporarily skyrocketed the\r\npopulation of Moab and sent uranium hunters into every nook and cranny\r\nof the canyon lands. Many of the jeep trails were first made then, and\r\nlanding strips and prospect holes of that period are plentiful. Most of\r\nthe prospects were in the Chinle Formation, particularly in the Moss\r\nBack Member at the base, but some were in rocks older than the Chinle,\r\nand some were in younger rocks. The uranium mines in the park are no\r\nlonger operating, but production has been resumed in a few mines just\r\nnorth and east of the park. Information on some of these mines, obtained\r\nfrom E. P. Beroni (U.S. Atomic Energy Comm., oral commun., Feb. 14,\r\n1973) is given at appropriate places below.\r\n\r\nThe number of boaters or floaters on the Colorado and Green Rivers is\r\nincreasing steadily, and trips by jet boat and other power boats are\r\navailable from Moab. Tourist travel over good roads on Island in the Sky\r\nand Hatch Point and by paved road to The Needles also is increasing\r\nsteadily. Travel west of the Green River and main stem of the Colorado\r\nRiver is still restricted largely to a few jeep trails and to hiking or\r\nhorseback riding.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeographic Setting\r\n\r\n\r\nGeologists have divided the United States into many provinces, each of\r\nwhich has distinctive geologic and topographic characteristics that set\r\nit apart from the others. One of the most intriguing and scenic of these\r\nis the Colorado Plateaus province, referred to in this report simply as\r\nthe Colorado Plateau, or the Plateau. This province, which covers some\r\n150,000 square miles and is not all plateaus, as we shall see, extends\r\nfrom Rifle, Colo., at the northeast to a little beyond Flagstaff, Ariz.,\r\nat the southwest and from Cedar City, Utah, at the west nearly to\r\nAlbuquerque, N. Mex., at the southeast. Canyonlands National Park\r\nappropriately occupies the heart of the Canyon Lands section, one of the\r\nsix subdivisions of the Plateau. As the names imply, the Canyon Lands\r\nsection of the Plateau comprises a high plateau, generally ranging in\r\naltitude from 5,000 to 7,000 feet, which has been intricately dissected\r\nby literally thousands of canyons.\r\n\r\nCanyonlands National Park is drained entirely by the Colorado and Green\r\nRivers, whose confluence is an important and scenic central feature of\r\nthe park (figs. 59, 60). Individual canyons traversed or drained by\r\nthese rivers are discussed in later chapters.\r\n\r\nWhen Major Powell reached the confluence in 1869, the river flowing in\r\nfrom the northeast to join the Green River was called the Grand River,\r\nand the Green and Grand joined there to form the Colorado River. The\r\nGrand River was renamed Colorado River by act of the Colorado State\r\nLegislature approved March 24, 1921, and by act of Congress approved\r\nJuly 25, 1921. But the old term still remains in names such as Grand\r\nCounty, Colo., the headwaters region; Grand Valley, a town 16 miles west\r\nof Rifle, Colo.; Grand Valley between Palisade and Mack, Colo.; Grand\r\nMesa, which towers more than a mile above the Grand and Gunnison River\r\nvalleys; Grand Junction, Colo., a city appropriately located at the\r\nconfluence of the Grand and Gunnison Rivers; Grand County, Utah, which\r\nthe river traverses after entering Utah; and Grand View Point, the\r\nsouthern terminus of Island in the Sky.\r\n\r\nWhen viewed at a distance of 1 foot, the shaded relief map (fig. 1)\r\nshows the general shape of the land surface in and near Canyonlands\r\nNational Park to the same horizontal scale as it would appear to a\r\nperson in a spacecraft flying at a height of 250,000 feet, or about 48\r\nmiles. This map was prepared by artist John R. Stacy from parts of the\r\nreverse sides of four plastic relief maps[2]—Salina, Moab, Cortez, and\r\nEscalante quadrangles, at a scale of 1:250,000—using a simple time- and\r\nmoney-saving method he devised (Stacy, 1962).\r\n\r\nAn image of Canyonlands National Park and vicinity from a satellite at a\r\nheight of about 570 miles is shown in figure 7. Note white clouds and\r\nblack cloud shadows on right.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK AND VICINITY, from NASA’s\r\n    unmanned Earth Resources Technology Satellite (ERTS-1), at height of\r\n    about 570 miles. The space image map was prepared from simultaneous\r\n    scanning in three color bands—blue green, red, and near\r\n    infrared—that were combined to produce a false-color image in which\r\n    vigorous green vegetation (forests and irrigated areas) appears\r\n    bright red, water dark blue, and soils and bare rocks various shades\r\n    of blue, blue green, or yellow green. Bright-blue area on west bank\r\n    of Colorado River about 10 miles southwest of Moab is the group of\r\n    large evaporation ponds of Texas Gulf, Inc., shown in figures 31 and\r\n    71. Images were taken at 10:31:10 a.m., Aug. 23, 1972, during the\r\n    432d orbit, telemetered to Alaska, videotaped, then photographed.\r\n    Sun elevation was 53 degrees above horizon from azimuth of 130\r\n    degrees. Image covers an area about 100 miles square. (See scale.)\r\n    Location of Monticello is approximate; that of other towns is\r\n    believed to be correct. Park boundaries are not shown because of\r\n    difficulty in locating them accurately, but features such as\r\n    Colorado and Green Rivers can easily be compared with those in\r\n    figure 1. (Fig. 7).]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRocks and Landforms\r\n\r\n\r\nThe vivid and varied colors of the bare rocks and the fantastic canyons,\r\nbuttes, spires, columns, alcoves, caves, arches, and other erosional\r\nforms of the canyon country result from a fortuitous combination of\r\ngeologic and climatic circumstances and events unequaled in most other\r\nparts of the world.\r\n\r\nFirst among these events was the piling up, layer upon layer, of\r\nthousands of feet of sedimentary rocks under a wide variety of\r\nenvironments. Sedimentary rocks of the region are composed of particles\r\nranging in size from clay and silt through sand and gravel carried to\r\ntheir resting places by moving water, silt and sand particles\r\ntransported by wind, and some materials precipitated from water\r\nsolutions, such as limestone (calcium carbonate), dolomite (calcium and\r\nmagnesium carbonate), gypsum (calcium sulfate with some water),\r\nanhydrite (calcium sulfate alone), common salt (sodium chloride), potash\r\nminerals such as potassium chloride, and a few other less common types.\r\nSome of the materials were laid down in shallow seas that once covered\r\nthe area (fig. 8) or in lagoons and estuaries near the sea. Some beds\r\nwere deposited by streams in inland basins or plains, a few were\r\ndeposited in lakes, and some, like the Navajo Sandstone, were carried in\r\nby the wind. The character and thickness of the sedimentary rocks, and\r\nthe names and ages assigned to them by geologists, are shown in the rock\r\ncolumn in figure 9 and in the cross sections in figures 10 and 15, and\r\nthe history of their deposition is discussed in the chapter “Summary of\r\nGeologic History.” The rock column was compiled mainly from generalized\r\nstratigraphic sections given by Baker (1933, 1946), McKnight (1940),\r\nHinrichs and others (1967, 1971b), and F. A. McKeown and P. P. Orkild\r\n(U.S. Geol. Survey, unpub. data, Mar. 16, 1973).\r\n\r\nNot exposed in the area but present far beneath the sedimentary cover,\r\nand exposed in a few surrounding places, are examples of the other two\r\nprincipal types of rocks: (1) igneous rocks, solidified from molten rock\r\nforced into or above younger rocks along cracks, joints, and faults and\r\n(2) much older metamorphic rocks, formed from other pre-existing rock\r\ntypes by great heat and pressure at extreme depths. The particles\r\ncomprising the sedimentary rocks were derived by weathering and erosion\r\nof rocks of all three types in the headwater regions of the ancestral\r\nColorado River basin. Igneous rocks of Tertiary Age (fig. 80) form the\r\nnearby La Sal, Abajo, and Henry Mountains (fig. 7).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SHALLOW INLAND SEA which covered Canyonlands and\r\n    vicinity during Middle Pennsylvanian time. (Fig. 8)]\r\n\r\nSecond among the main events leading to the formation of the canyon\r\ncountry was the raising and buckling of the Plateau by earth forces so\r\nthat it could be vigorously attacked by various forces of erosion and so\r\nthat the rock materials thus pried loose or dissolved could eventually\r\nbe carted away to the Gulf of California by the ancestral Colorado\r\nRiver. Some idea of the enormous volume of rock thus removed is apparent\r\nwhen you look down some 2,000 feet to the river from any of the high\r\noverlooks, such as Dead Horse Point (fig. 15) or Green River Overlook\r\n(fig. 23), or when you lay a straightedge across the three high mesas in\r\nfigure 10 and note the large volume of missing rocks below. Not so\r\napparent, however, is the fact that some 10,000 feet of younger Mesozoic\r\nand Tertiary rocks that once overlay this high plateau also has been\r\nswept away. In all, the river has carried thousands of cubic miles of\r\nsediment to the sea and is still actively at work on this gigantic\r\nearthmoving project. In an earlier report (Lohman, 1965, p. 42) I\r\nestimated that the rate of removal may have been as great as about 3\r\ncubic miles each century. For a few years the bulk of it was dumped into\r\nLake Mead, but now Lake Powell is getting much of it. When these and\r\nother reservoirs ultimately become filled with sediment, for reservoirs\r\nand lakes are but temporary things, the Gulf of California will again\r\nbecome the burial ground.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ROCK COLUMN OF CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK.

A wetter climate would have produced a far\r\ndifferent and smoother landscape in which most of the rocks and land\r\nforms would have been hidden by vegetation. In the canyon lands the\r\nvegetation is mainly on the high mesas and on the narrow flood plains\r\nbordering the rivers, but scanty vegetation does grow on the gentle\r\nslopes or flats.\r\n\r\nThe desert climate has combined with the nearly flat lying layers of\r\nsediments of different character, hardness, and thickness to produce\r\nsteep slopes having many cliffs and ledges and generally sharp to\r\nangular edges rather than the subdued rounded forms of more humid\r\nregions. This has led geologists to refer to such terrain as having\r\n“layer-cake geology,” and this is brought out by the profile in the rock\r\ncolumn (fig. 9), by the cross section (fig. 10), by figure 15, and by\r\nmany of the other photographs. But the baker of this cake was rather\r\ncareless—not only do the layers range widely in thickness and character,\r\nbut some are wedge shaped, thick on one side of the cake but thin or\r\nabsent on the other. Then too, when he ran out of icing in the midst of\r\na layer, he was apt to finish with a different kind or color, for no\r\ninspector was on the job to insure orderly construction.\r\n\r\nIf all the rock strata in the park were present at one locality, their\r\nsequence and thickness would be those shown on the right-hand side of\r\nthe graphic section in figure 9. However, because of the lateral changes\r\nin thickness and character and the wedging out of certain beds, such as\r\nthe White Rim Sandstone Member of the Cutler Formation, no two sections\r\nof the strata are exactly alike. This will be brought out in photographs\r\nof different exposures of rocks in various parts of the park.\r\n\r\nAn often-asked question is, why are most of the rocks so red? This can\r\nbe answered by one word—iron, the same pigment used in rouge and in\r\npaint for barns and boxcars. Various oxides of iron, some including\r\nwater, produce not only brick red but also pink, salmon, brown, buff,\r\nyellow, and even green or bluish green. This does not imply that the\r\nrocks could be considered as sources of iron ore, for the merest trace\r\nof iron, generally only 1 to 3 percent, is enough to produce even the\r\ndarkest shades of red. The only rocks in the park that contain virtually\r\nno iron are white sandstones of the White Rim Sandstone Member of the\r\nCutler Formation (figs. 21-24) and the Navajo Sandstone.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 10, first section]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SECTION ACROSS CANYONLANDS NATIONAL PARK from North\r\n    Point at west (left), via Grand View Point in middle, to Needles\r\n    Overlook at east (right), showing the three principal topographic\r\n    levels and character of the rock strata. Line of section bends at\r\n    Grand View Point, which is northernmost part. (Fig. 10)]\r\n\r\nAs pointed out by Stokes (1970, p. 3), microscopic examination of the\r\ncolored grains of quartz or other minerals shows the pigment to be\r\nmerely a thin coating on and between white or colorless particles. Sand\r\nor silt weathered from such rocks soon loses its color by the scouring\r\naction of wind or water, so most of the sand dunes and sand bars are\r\nwhite or nearly so.\r\n\r\nThe map (fig. 1) and cross section (fig. 10) of the park show that in\r\ngeneral the major features of the landscape lie at three different and\r\ndistinctive levels. A recently erected plaque on Grand View Point\r\nappropriately refers to these levels as the “Three Worlds.” The high\r\nplateaus, or mesas, in and adjoining the park dominate the skyline—in\r\nfact, the central one, between the Green and Colorado Rivers, is\r\nappropriately named Island in the Sky. If you stand on either the east\r\nor the west shore of this towering cliff-bordered island, you can look\r\nacross a sea of fantastic erosional forms to a similar cliff-bordered\r\nshore at about the same level. Closer inspection of the sea of rocks on\r\neither side shows relatively flat benches or platforms about halfway to\r\nthe bottom; below these are the generally steep sided or cliff-bordered\r\ncanyons of the two rivers and their larger tributaries. From some\r\nvantage points along the shore, such as Dead Horse Point (fig. 15) or\r\nGreen River Overlook (fig. 23), you can see the deepest level of all—the\r\nchannels and flood plains of the Green and Colorado Rivers.\r\n\r\nWhat caused the “Three Worlds” and the formidable cliffs supporting the\r\nhigh mesas or forming towering monoliths like Angel Arch or Druid Arch\r\n(figs. 43, 54)? Differences in the composition, hardness, arrangement,\r\nand thickness of the rock layers determine their ability to withstand\r\nthe forces of fracturing and erosion and hence their tendency to form\r\ncliffs, ledges, or slopes. Most of the cliff- or ledge-forming rocks are\r\nsandstones consisting of sand grains deposited by wind or water and\r\nlater cemented together by silica (SiO₂), calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), or\r\none of the iron oxides (such as Fe₂O₃), but some hard, resistant ledges\r\nare made of limestone (calcium carbonate). The rock column (fig. 9)\r\nshows in general how these rock formations are sculptured by erosion and\r\nhow they protect underlying layers from more rapid erosion. The nearly\r\nvertical cliffs supporting the highest mesas consist of the\r\nwell-cemented Wingate Sandstone protected above by the even harder\r\nsandstone of the Kayenta Formation. To borrow from an earlier report of\r\nmine (Lohman, 1965, p. 17),\r\n\r\n  Vertical cliffs and shafts of the Wingate Sandstone endure only where\r\n  the top of the formation is capped by beds of the next younger rock\r\n  unit—the Kayenta Formation. The Kayenta is much more resistant than\r\n  the Wingate, so even a few feet of the Kayenta * * * protect the rock\r\n  beneath.\r\n\r\nIn some places remnants of the overlying Navajo Sandstone make up the\r\ntopmost unit of the cliff.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow to See the Park\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of how to see the park has no simple answer, for the park\r\nis too vast and complex to comprehend by a quick visit to any one of its\r\nmany and varied parts or by any one means of transportation. Some, as\r\ndid Major Powell, view it only from the rivers—by boat plus a few\r\nback-breaking climbs up the bordering canyon walls. Others see only the\r\nsmall parts reachable by passenger cars. The more venturesome see vastly\r\nmore by jeep, foot, or horseback. And a few prefer to view it as the\r\nbirds do—from the air. Many, those who put aside their magazines long\r\nenough, get bird’s-eye views without half trying, for Canyonlands is\r\nbeneath the principal air routes connecting Los Angeles with Grand\r\nJunction and Denver. Actually, a full appreciation of all the wonders\r\nand beauties of the park is possible only by combining all these\r\napproaches and methods of locomotion, but only a few fortunate souls\r\nsuch as Bates Wilson have thus been able to inspect virtually every\r\nsquare foot of it.\r\n\r\nThe task clearly before me, then, is how best to present such a complex\r\nwonderland to you, the reader. The method I selected, after considerable\r\nthought and a few false starts, is to begin at the top—the high\r\nmesas—and work my way downward much as the rivers have done in carving\r\nout this fantastic area, to some of the broad benchlands beneath the\r\nmesas and eventually to the river channels and deep canyons. Although\r\nthe approach I selected may not be the best, and admittedly is but one\r\nof several that comes to mind, I hope it gets the job done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             The High Mesas\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though the “peninsular” mesas east and west of Island in the Sky,\r\nknown respectively as Hatch Point and the Orange Cliffs, lie outside the\r\npresent boundaries, they provide breathtaking views of important\r\nfeatures within the park, so brief descriptions of them are included\r\nbelow. But first, let us take a closer look at Island in the Sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Island in the Sky\r\n\r\nAs the map (fig. 1) shows, Island in the Sky is really a fork of a\r\nwedge-shaped peninsula extending southward between the two rivers. An\r\noutlier to the south named Junction Butte has already been severed from\r\nthe main peninsula by erosion and now is a true island. (See\r\nfrontispiece and fig. 22.) A large chunk of Island in the Sky south of\r\nThe Neck was about to be severed by erosion from the main peninsula to\r\nbecome a true island, when recent widening and grading of the road gave\r\nit a temporary reprieve. When my family and I first squeaked over this\r\nnarrow neck in 1960 by jeep, furtive glances to right or left showed the\r\ntwo canyons perilously close, and complete severance seemed imminent.\r\nThe road builders have staved off disaster for a few thousand years, but\r\nultimately the large section to the south will become another island,\r\nand a bridge will be required to connect it to the mainland. Its\r\nappearance from the air before the road widening is shown in figure 11.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: AERIAL VIEW OF THE NECK AND SHAFER TRAIL, looking\r\n    southwest, taken before rebuilding of park road on mesa top.\r\n    Cliff-walled canyon to right of The Neck, in middle, drains westward\r\n    to the Green River; south fork of Shafer Canyon to left drains\r\n    eastward to Colorado River. This is the narrowest part of Island in\r\n    the Sky. Photograph by National Park Service. (Fig. 11)]\r\n\r\nThe entrance road to Island in the Sky intersects U.S. Highway 163 at a\r\npoint 10 miles northwest of Moab, or 21 miles southeast of Crescent\r\nJunction on Interstate Highway 70. From U.S. 163 a paved road climbs\r\ncolorful Sevenmile Canyon past sandstone cliffs of the Wingate, Kayenta,\r\nand Navajo Formations to reach the high mesa. There, just “offshore” to\r\nthe north, are anchored the “battleships” that guard the island—Merrimac\r\nand Monitor Buttes (fig. 12). These landmarks are composed of the\r\nEntrada Sandstone—the same rock that forms Church Rock at the entrance\r\nto the Needles district (fig. 37) and that shapes the spectacular arches\r\nin Arches National Park. All three members of the Entrada (Wright and\r\nothers, 1962), as noted in the figure 12 caption, are present here as\r\nwell as at Church Rock. Eleven miles from the junction with U.S. Highway\r\n163 a graded road to the right, called Horsethief Trail, goes 16 miles\r\ndown to the Green River, where it connects with roads following the\r\nriver both upstream and downstream. The road upstream leads to two\r\nuranium mines in the lower part of Mineral Canyon which were reactivated\r\nin 1972 and 1973. The switchbacks are quite spectacular and are\r\nreminiscent of the Shafer Trail. Three miles south of the Horsethief\r\nTrail turnoff is a fork in the road—to the left the pavement continues\r\nto Dead Horse Point, and straight ahead a graded road leads southward to\r\nthe Island in the Sky district of Canyonlands National Park.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MERRIMAC (LEFT) AND MONITOR BUTTES guard north\r\n    entrance to Island in the Sky. White rock near middle is Navajo\r\n    Sandstone. Buttes comprise all three members of Entrada Sandstone:\r\n    remnant white top of Moab Member, vertical cliffs of Slick Rock\r\n    Member, and sloping base of Dewey Bridge Member. (Fig. 12)]\r\n\r\nMost of Island in the Sky has a scattered growth of piñon and juniper\r\ntrees, but several large flat areas, such as Grays Pasture, contain\r\nsufficient sandy soil to support a mantle of grass and weeds, which is\r\nused for grazing; however, grazing in this part of the park will be\r\ndiscontinued in 1975.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DEAD HORSE POINT STATE PARK\r\n\r\nLet us follow the paved road from U.S. Highway 163 all the way to Dead\r\nHorse Point, which was set aside as a state park in 1957. The park has a\r\nvisitor center, museum, modern campgrounds and picnic facilities, and\r\npiped water, which is hauled all the way from Moab. An entrance fee of\r\n$1 permits us to drive across the narrow neck to a parking area near the\r\npoint proper, which is protected by stone walls and is provided with a\r\nramada, benches, paths, and sanitary facilities. From Dead Horse Point\r\nwe get breathtaking views in several directions, including a loop of the\r\nColorado River called the Goose Neck, 2,000 feet nearly straight down.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CANE CREEK ANTICLINE, looking northeast toward the La\r\n    Sal Mountains from Dead Horse Point. Colorado River cuts across\r\n    crest at middle right, above which is Anticline Overlook. (See fig.\r\n    31.) Jeep trail and part of Shafer dome lie below. (Fig. 13)]\r\n\r\nHow did such a magnificent viewpoint get such a macabre name? Dead Horse\r\nPoint was named for a sad but colorful legend concerning a band of wild\r\nhorses that once roamed the high mesas. The point is really an embryo\r\nisland separated from the mainland by a narrow neck barely wide enough\r\nfor the present road. In the early cowboy days the island was used as a\r\nnatural corral in which wild mustangs were penned up behind a short\r\nfence across the neck so that the better ones could be sorted out and\r\ndriven to mines in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. A band of horses\r\ncorralled too long without water allegedly died of thirst within sight\r\nof the river 2,000 feet below, hence the name of the point, or at least\r\nso one version of the story goes. Some versions allude to the wranglers\r\nas cowboys; others, as horsethieves.\r\n\r\nTo the northeast we can see the Cane Creek anticline—an upward fold of\r\nthe rocks—behind which loom the La Sal Mountains (fig. 13). A cutaway\r\nview of a typical anticline is shown in figure 14. A better view of the\r\nCane Creek anticline can be seen from Anticline Overlook, as shown in\r\nfigure 31. From our vantage point at Dead Horse Point, we can see much\r\nof Hatch Point, including Anticline Overlook, by looking east and\r\nsoutheast. Spectacular views of the northern part of Canyonlands\r\nNational Park lie to the south, southwest, and east. Looking southwest\r\n(fig. 15), we see most of the rock formations exposed in\r\nCanyonlands—more than can be seen from any other vantage point in or\r\nnear the park. The names of the visible rock units shown in figure 15\r\ncan be compared with the complete list in the rock column (fig. 9).\r\nParts of Shafer dome, a “closed” rounded anticline, are visible in the\r\nlower left of figure 15 and in the lower right of figure 13. Its general\r\ndomelike shape is outlined by the bluish-white Shafer limestone, a\r\nmarker bed which also caps the bench on the peninsula within the Goose\r\nNeck of the river. This limestone, which here forms the top of the Rico\r\nFormation, is not shown in the rock column (fig. 9) because its exposure\r\nis limited to the Shafer dome and the Cane Creek anticline and its name\r\nis used only locally by prospectors for oil and gas.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CUTAWAY VIEW OF ANTICLINE, or upfold of the rocks.\r\n    From Hansen (1969, p. 31).

(Compare with fig. 9.)\r\n    (Fig. 15)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Fig. 15, cont.]\r\n\r\nNote that the White Rim Sandstone Member of the Cutler Formation,\r\nreferred to hereinafter simply as the White Rim Sandstone, becomes\r\nthinner toward the right (northeast) in figure 15 but is absent entirely\r\nin figure 13, just a short distance to the northeast. The gradual\r\ndisappearance of recognizable beds of this type toward the northeast,\r\nincluding the disappearance of some limestone beds containing marine\r\nfossils, are examples of what geologists call facies changes. Here the\r\nchanges result from the fact that while strata were being deposited in\r\nor near ancient seas that lay to the southwest, beds of different\r\ncharacter were being laid down on land by streams emanating from the\r\nnortheast. This will be gone into in more detail in discussions that\r\naccompany illustrations to follow, particularly figure 27, fig. 31, and\r\nfig. 35.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             NORTH ENTRANCE\r\n\r\nThe north entrance to the Island in the Sky district of Canyonlands\r\nNational Park used to be 6 miles south of the junction with the paved\r\nroad to Dead Horse Point, but since the land additions of November 1971,\r\nit is only 4½ miles south of this junction. A temporary trailer-housed\r\nentrance station marks the old boundary.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      SHAFER AND WHITE RIM TRAILS\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1950’s a remarkable but hair-raising road known as\r\nShafer Trail was cut down the face of the cliffs below The Neck to reach\r\nthe C Group of uranium claims near the head of Lathrop Canyon. It\r\nbranches southward from the park road a mile south of the new entrance,\r\nthen descends in a series of switchbacks. The aerial view (fig. 11)\r\nshows the upper trail and The Neck before the park road was graded and\r\nwidened, and a view from near The Neck (fig. 16) shows the precipitous\r\ncliffs the trail descends. It follows the general route of an old foot\r\ntrail.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SHAFER TRAIL, from just south of The Neck (fig. 1,\r\n    fig. 11). Navajo Sandstone is above road at left, Kayenta Formation\r\n    forms upper half of cliff below road, and Wingate Sandstone forms\r\n    lower, vertical half of cliff; lower part of road is in Chinle\r\n    Formation. (Fig. 16)]\r\n\r\nShafer Trail connects with the White Rim Trail, which, as the name\r\nsuggests, is built mainly on the White Rim, after which the White Rim\r\nSandstone was named. The White Rim Trail can be followed northeastward\r\nto join the pavement at Potash, or it can be followed southward along\r\nthe Colorado River canyons to Junction Butte, thence northward along\r\nStillwater and Labyrinth Canyons of the Green River to and beyond the\r\nnorthern boundary of the park. At Horsethief Bottom, you can leave the\r\ncanyon by Horsethief Trail and rejoin the paved road leading northward\r\nto U.S. 163. At Lathrop Canyon, 8 or 10 miles south of where Shafer\r\nTrail meets the White Rim Trail, a branch of the White Rim Trail leads\r\ndownward to the Colorado River, where picnic tables and sanitary\r\nfacilities are provided. This is used as a lunch stop by some boating\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nAlthough some two-wheel-drive cars or trucks have traversed the White\r\nRim and Shafer Trails, they may encounter trouble with deep sand,\r\nwashouts, or fallen rocks, so four-wheel-drive vehicles are recommended.\r\nIn the summer these trails should not be attempted without plenty of\r\nwater, and two vehicles traveling together provide an added margin of\r\nsafety. All vehicles should carry emergency equipment including a\r\nshovel, tow chain or rope, jack, tire tools, and other necessary items.\r\nGeologists and uranium prospectors working along the White Rim Trail\r\nhave obtained good drinking water from small springs that flow from the\r\nbase of the White Rim Sandstone in many places (Neal Hinrichs, U.S.\r\nGeol. Survey, oral commun., Feb. 1973). After rains, runoff gathers in\r\nlarge potholes in the White Rim Sandstone in some places and affords\r\nemergency drinking water. Several such potholes filled with water are\r\nshown in figure 17. Some potholes occur also in the Cedar Mesa Sandstone\r\nin the Needles district.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            GRAND VIEW POINT\r\n\r\nAbout a mile southwest of The Neck, the road crosses Grays Pasture—the\r\nwidest and flattest part of Island in the Sky. The drive over this flat\r\ngrassland yields not the slightest hint of the awesome cliff-walled\r\nchasms on either side of the island. Some 5 miles southwest of The Neck,\r\nboth the island and the road branch like a Y. At a point 0.4 mile north\r\nof the Y, Mesa Trail leads one-quarter mile east to Canyon Viewpoint\r\nArch, which frames the Colorado River canyon and the La Sal Mountains\r\n(fig. 18). This arch, at the very top edge of the cliff, is composed of\r\nthe lower part of the Navajo Sandstone. The only other arch of Navajo\r\nSandstone in or near the park that I know of is the small one shown in\r\nfigure 33, but of course there may be others.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NATURAL TANKS, filled with runoff from rain, serve as\r\n    emergency sources of drinking water. Largest tank in foreground\r\n    contains 4 feet of water and small fresh-water shrimp. So-called\r\n    tanks, or potholes, are formed partly by water dissolving the\r\n    calcium carbonate cement and partly by wind or water removing the\r\n    resulting loose sand grains. View is north toward Junction Butte\r\n    from point about a mile south of the White Rim Trail. Red rocks in\r\n    hill on right are in lower part of Moenkopi Formation. Photograph by\r\n    E. N. Hinrichs. (Fig. 17)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CANYON VIEWPOINT ARCH, framing Colorado River canyon\r\n    at east end of Mesa Trail 0.4 mile north of Y in Island in the Sky\r\n    road.

Numbers refer\r\n    to figure numbers. (Fig. 19)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE WHITE RIM, looking northeast toward La Sal\r\n    Mountains from overlook 3 miles north of Grand View Point. White Rim\r\n    Sandstone here is thicker than near Dead Horse Point (fig. 15) but\r\n    thinner than in Monument Basin and Stillwater Canyon (fig. 21, fig.\r\n    23). (Fig. 20)]\r\n\r\nLet us now take the branch south of the Y and follow the narrow crest of\r\nGrand View Point for about 6 miles to the main overlook. About 0.9 mile\r\nsouth of the Y, a short walk to the west over the lower part of the\r\nNavajo Sandstone affords a magnificent view of Stillwater Canyon of the\r\nGreen River, including Turks Head (fig. 23, fig. 24). Half way to the\r\npoint is a parking area and overlook, from which we get a spectacular\r\nview of canyons cutting the White Rim and of the La Sal Mountains beyond\r\n(fig. 20). Note that the White Rim Sandstone, which forms the broad\r\nbench appropriately named the White Rim, is here much thicker than where\r\nseen near Dead Horse Point (fig. 15).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MONUMENT BASIN FROM GRAND VIEW POINT, Needles\r\n    Overlook on left skyline, Abajo Mountains on right skyline. Red\r\n    spires and cliffs in basin are Organ Rock Tongue of Cutler\r\n    Formation. (Fig. 21)]\r\n\r\nThree more miles southward takes us to Grand View Point and its nearby\r\npicnic area. Though named after the former Grand River some 2,000 feet\r\nbelow, Grand View Point has a double meaning, for we see from here a\r\ntruly grand view (fig. 21)! At our feet is spectacular Monument Basin,\r\ncut below the White Rim into the brick-red Organ Rock Tongue of the\r\nCutler Formation. The White Rim Sandstone here is slightly thicker than\r\nto the northeast (fig. 20) but thinner than to the west (fig. 23),\r\nbecause it forms a wedge-shaped body that thickens westward. In the\r\ndistance southeastward are the Abajo Mountains, just west of Monticello,\r\nUtah. The prominent projection on Hatch Point on the left skyline is\r\nNeedles Overlook, from which the photograph in figure 27 was taken. A\r\ncloseup view of Monument Basin, showing Junction Butte and Grand View\r\nPoint in the background, is shown in figure 22. The slender spire in the\r\nforeground has a measured height of 305 feet (Findley, 1971, p. 78).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: MONUMENT BASIN FROM THE AIR, looking north to\r\n    Junction Butte and Grand View Point.

Photograph by National Park Service (Fig. 22)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          GREEN RIVER OVERLOOK\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter mile west of the Y, a left fork of the road goes about a\r\nmile and a half to Green River Overlook, which provides a superb view of\r\nStillwater Canyon of the Green River, the Orange Cliffs beyond, and the\r\nHenry Mountains in the extreme distance (fig. 23). Note that here the\r\nWhite Rim Sandstone is much thicker than in preceding views. The\r\nprominent butte enclosed by the loop of the river is known as Turks Head\r\nand is better seen from the air (fig. 24). The light-colored band near\r\nthe base of the cliffs in the background of figure 24 is characteristic\r\nof the bleached upper part of the Moenkopi Formation in this part of the\r\npark. According to F. A. McKeown and P. P. Orkild (U.S. Geol. Survey,\r\nunpub. data, Feb. 16, 1973), petroliferous material or odor generally\r\noccurs in this bleached zone and in the basal beds of the Moenkopi.\r\n\r\nThe campground just north of Green River Overlook has no water at this\r\nwriting (1973), but water from wells in Taylor Canyon will eventually be\r\npiped to nearby parts of Island in the Sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             UPHEAVAL DOME\r\n\r\nFive miles northwest of the Y we come to Upheaval Dome, one of the most\r\nunusual geographic and geologic features of the park. Viewed from the\r\nair (fig. 25), it resembles somewhat a volcanic or meteor crater and has\r\nbeen called such by some. Because beds of salt are known to underlie the\r\npark, some have suggested that the salt may have thickened and welled\r\nupward to form a salt dome, similar to domes along the Gulf Coast\r\n(Mattox, 1968). However, only 1,470 feet of salt was encountered in an\r\noil test just east of Upheaval Dome (Robert J. Hite, U.S. Geol. Survey,\r\noral commun., Feb. 13, 1973); so although salt may have played a role,\r\nUpheaval Dome clearly is not a salt dome with dimensions similar to the\r\nGulf Coast types. It may be related to a mound on the deep-seated\r\nPrecambrian rocks (Joesting and Plouff, 1958, fig. 3; Joesting and\r\nothers, 1966, p. 13, 14, 17), but the exact origin of the dome is not\r\nclear.\r\n\r\nThe central part has the structure of a dome, in that the strata dip\r\ndownward away from the middle. A ringlike syncline, or downward fold in\r\nthe rock layers (fig. 26), surrounds the dome, beyond which the strata\r\nresume their nearly flat position. The white rock in the bottom of the\r\ncraterlike depression is not salt, but jumbled large fragments of the\r\nWhite Rim Sandstone. Surrounding that are slopes of the Moenkopi and\r\nChinle Formations, cliffs of the Wingate Sandstone, a circular bench of\r\nthe Kayenta Formation, and outer ramparts of the Navajo Sandstone.\r\nUpheaval Canyon leads to Stillwater Canyon of the Green River at the\r\nupper left.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: STILLWATER CANYON AND GREEN RIVER, looking southwest\r\n    from Green River loop of river.

(Fig. 25)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CUTAWAY VIEW OF SYNCLINE, or downfold of the rocks.\r\n    From Hansen (1969, p. 108). (Fig. 26)]\r\n\r\nOne mile before the road ends, a well-marked foot trail leads to the top\r\nof Whale Rock, a prominence on the Navajo Sandstone that forms the outer\r\nring of the dome. At the end of the road, another foot trail ascends\r\nfrom the picnic area to the foot of the Wingate Sandstone cliffs around\r\nthe central part of the dome. The views of the dome from these trails\r\nare interesting, but you are really too close to get a true picture of\r\nthe unusual feature, which is obtainable only from the air, as shown in\r\nfigure 25.\r\n\r\nJust west of Upheaval Dome, Bighorn Mesa is connected to Steer Mesa by a\r\nneck only 15 feet wide flanked by 300-foot vertical cliffs, as pointed\r\nout by McKnight (1940, p. 12). I later learned from Ed McKnight (oral\r\ncommun., June 6, 1973) that during his field work in this area in 1926\r\nhe was riding a mule across this narrow neck when the half-asleep mule\r\nsuddenly became aware of the dropoff on one side and began to turn\r\naround and head back. Ed hastily but cautiously dismounted and led the\r\nmule across! When this neck is finally breached by erosion, Bighorn Mesa\r\nwill be just as isolated and inaccessible as Junction Butte, now cut off\r\nfrom Grand View Point. (See frontispiece and fig. 27.)\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Hatch Point\r\n\r\nThe high mesa east of Canyonlands National Park and the Colorado River\r\ncanyons, called Hatch Point, contains several vantage points ideally\r\nsuited for viewing scenic features of the park and adjacent areas. Hatch\r\nPoint is part of the vast public domain administered by the Bureau of\r\nLand Management—a sister agency of the Geological Survey and the\r\nNational Park Service, all in the U.S. Department of the Interior. The\r\nBureau, hereinafter referred to simply as the B.L.M., has made many\r\nimprovements on Hatch Point, including fine roads, two modern\r\ncampgrounds with sanitary facilities and piped water from wells, and two\r\noverlooks with protective fences, benches, paths, sanitary facilities,\r\nand ramadas containing panels that describe the features visible from\r\nthe viewpoints. Because of these improvements, the B.L.M. has\r\nappropriately named this area “Canyon Rims Recreation Area.”\r\n\r\nGeologically, Hatch Point is similar to Island in the Sky. Both are\r\nbordered by towering cliffs of the Wingate Sandstone capped by the\r\nresistant Kayenta Formation, and rounded remnants of the overlying\r\nNavajo Sandstone rise above the otherwise-flat mesa surface in many\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nAccess to this high tableland is by a good paved road leading west from\r\nU.S. Highway 163 at a point 32 miles south of Moab and 22 miles north of\r\nMonticello. About 5 miles west of the highway we pass Windwhistle\r\nCampground, nestled in an attractive cove of Entrada Sandstone cliffs,\r\nand 16 miles from the highway we reach an intersection. From here it is\r\n7 miles west by paved road to Needles Overlook, 10 miles north to\r\nAnticline Overlook. Like the other high mesas, Hatch Point contains\r\nperipheral areas of scattered piñon and juniper trees and large flat\r\ngrasslands used for grazing. Grain tanks here and there store winter\r\nfeed for the cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            NEEDLES OVERLOOK\r\n\r\nLet us follow the pavement to Needles Overlook, from which fine morning\r\nviews of Canyonlands National Park can be seen to the south and west.\r\nNorthwestward (fig. 27) we look 10 miles across the Colorado River\r\ncanyon to Junction Butte and Grand View Point. (This view is along the\r\nline of the east half of the cross section in fig. 10.) The feather edge\r\nof the White Rim Sandstone caps the White Rim west of the Colorado\r\nRiver, but the White Rim is absent on the east side of the canyon and in\r\nthe entire Needles district to the southwest, where the important scenic\r\nfeatures are carved from the underlying Cedar Mesa Sandstone Member of\r\nthe Cutler Formation, referred to hereinafter simply as the Cedar Mesa\r\nSandstone. Both these sandstones are missing in the foreground of figure\r\n27—their place being taken by thin beds of red siltstone, mudstone, and\r\nsandstone similar to those that comprise the Organ Rock Tongue shown\r\nbetween the two sandstones in figure 22. These are additional examples\r\nof facies changes mentioned earlier (p. 34).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: JUNCTION BUTTE AND GRAND VIEW POINT, looking\r\n    northwest from Needles Overlook. (Fig. 27)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CANYONLANDS OVERLOOK\r\n\r\nTurning north from the intersection 7 miles east of Needles Overlook, we\r\ntraverse a nearly flat grassy tableland to Hatch Point Campground. In\r\nfigure 1 the campground is shown west of the old road; the new road is\r\nwest of the campground, but no map of the new route was available for\r\nplotting in figure 1. About a mile before we reach the campground a jeep\r\ntrail heads west then northwest about 5½ miles to Canyonlands Overlook,\r\na scant mile from, but some 1,400 feet above, the eastern border of\r\nCanyonlands National Park. This overlook affords fine views of the\r\nColorado River canyons and the eastern shore of Island in the Sky, but\r\nat present (1973) there are no plans to improve the trail for\r\npassenger-car travel.\r\n\r\nTwo miles north of the campground we cross a minor drainage leading\r\nnortheastward into the north fork of Trough Springs Canyon. The B.L.M.\r\nplans a road down this canyon to Kane Springs Canyon, 1,100 feet below,\r\nwhere it will connect both with a scenic drive to Moab, the lower part\r\nof which is paved, and with the jeep trail going west over Hurrah Pass\r\n(fig. 30) and thence south along the eastern benches of the canyons of\r\nthe Colorado River to the Needles district of the park. E. Neal Hinrichs\r\n(U.S. Geol. Survey, oral commun. Feb. 16, 1973) reported specimens of\r\nblue celestite (strontium sulfate, SrSO₄) and barite (barium sulfate,\r\nBaSO₄) in the Cutler Formation at a point where a sharp bend of this\r\njeep trail crosses a fault, or fracture (fig. 56), in the northeast fork\r\nof Lockhart Canyon (shown in fig. 1 as the easternmost loop of the trail\r\nabout 6 miles northeast of Lockhart Basin). Farther south, the trail\r\nswings west of Lockhart Basin, whose center exposes part of a syncline\r\n(fig. 28).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SYNCLINE IN CORE OF LOCKHART BASIN, near Needles\r\n    Overlook.

(Fig. 28)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                U-3 LOOP\r\n\r\nTwo and a half miles farther north, or about 2 miles south of Anticline\r\nOverlook, a short road leads to the west and entirely around a small\r\nconical butte of the Navajo Sandstone. This new circular drive has not\r\nyet been formally named and is simply called the U-3 loop, as designated\r\nin the surveyor’s notebook. It affords splendid views to the west and is\r\nto be equipped with picnic tables. Looking west (fig. 29) we see a\r\nW-shaped loop of the Colorado River, Dead Horse Point on the right\r\nskyline, and Island in the Sky on the distant skyline. The strata\r\ncurving over Shafer dome appear in the right middle background.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: VIEW WESTWARD FROM U-3 LOOP. Dead Horse Point on\r\n    right skyline, Island in the Sky capped by Navajo Sandstone in\r\n    extreme distance, Kayenta Formation in foreground at left. Cliffs\r\n    topping ridge at left are Wingate Sandstone protected by caprock of\r\n    the Kayenta Formation; red slopes beneath cliffs are Chinle\r\n    Formation, with dark ledge of Moss Back Member at base; steep slopes\r\n    and ledges beneath are Moenkopi Formation, lower part of which is\r\n    Hoskinnini Tongue; reddish gentle slopes below are Cutler Formation;\r\n    nearly flat benches above Colorado River are Rico Formation, with\r\n    Shafer limestone at top. (Fig. 29)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           ANTICLINE OVERLOOK\r\n\r\nTwo more miles takes us to Anticline Overlook for the most sublime views\r\nin this part of the area. To the north (fig. 30) we look across the\r\nnortheast flank of the Cane Creek anticline, an upfold of the rocks\r\n(figs. 13, 14). Hurrah Pass straddles the narrow wall separating the\r\nColorado River and its canyon at the left from Kane Springs Canyon on\r\nthe right. The Colorado River appears again in the right background,\r\nwhere it leaves Moab Valley. The Kings Bottom syncline, or downfold\r\n(fig. 26), seen in the middle distance between the Cane Creek anticline\r\nand the Moab anticline, exposes a wide area of the Navajo Sandstone. The\r\nridge on the right skyline, composed of the Entrada Sandstone, is The\r\nWindows Section of Arches National Park, and the left skyline shows\r\nfaintly the distant Book Cliffs.\r\n\r\nOn the east wall of Kane Springs Canyon just to the right of figure 30\r\nis the Atomic King mine in the Cutler Formation, from which uranium ore\r\nhas been mined at intervals during the last 2 or 3 years.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LOOKING NORTH FROM ANTICLINE OVERLOOK, across axis of\r\n    Cane Creek anticline. Unimproved road crosses Hurrah Pass in\r\n    foreground. Colorado River at left is near Potash and in right\r\n    background is at Moab. For description of strata, see caption for\r\n    figure 31. (Fig. 30)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CANE CREEK ANTICLINE, looking northwest from\r\n    Anticline Overlook. Colorado River is cutting into limestone of\r\n    unnamed upper member of Hermosa Formation in lower bench at crest of\r\n    fold; Rico Formation, with bluish-white Shafer limestone at top,\r\n    forms upper curved bench; remainder of formations are as given in\r\n    caption for figure 29. Potash mine (right) and evaporation ponds\r\n    (left) are operated by Texas Gulf, Inc. Merrimac and Monitor Buttes\r\n    on right skyline are shown in figure 12. (Fig. 31)]\r\n\r\nTo the northwest (fig. 31; see also fig. 13) is a textbook example of a\r\nrock fold—the Cane Creek anticline—laid bare by the Colorado River\r\ncutting directly across its crest (fig. 1). Anticlines are noted as\r\nsources of or at least hunting grounds for oil and gas, and this one is\r\nno exception, although production has been relatively small and was\r\nstopped altogether in about 1963. Some oil and gas was produced also\r\nfrom wells on the north flank of Shafer dome, just beneath Dead Horse\r\nPoint (figs. 1, 15), but other favorable-looking structures farther\r\nsouth that were tested, such as Lockhart anticline, Rustler dome, and\r\nGibson dome (fig. 1), failed to yield commercial amounts (Baker, 1933,\r\np. 80-84). Some of the colorful events in the early days of wildcatting\r\nare noted on page 100.\r\n\r\nExploration for oil and gas led to the discovery of potash beneath\r\nseveral anticlines in eastern Utah and western Colorado. According to\r\nHite (1968, p. 325), the Cane Creek anticline is underlain by about\r\n5,200 feet of salt-bearing rocks in the Paradox Member of the Hermosa\r\nFormation (fig. 9), of which about 84 percent is halite (common salt,\r\nsodium chloride) and associated potash salts (sylvite, potassium\r\nchloride). The potash mine of Texas Gulf, Inc., is shown at the right in\r\nfigure 31. The white area to the left of the mine is waste common salt,\r\nwhich is recovered with the potash salts, and the white area with dark\r\nstripes at the left is a small part of more than 400 acres of\r\nevaporation ponds built to separate the salts. These ponds also can be\r\nseen from Dead Horse Point. The dark stripes are the visible parts of\r\nplastic membranes lining the ponds. Mining of an 11-foot bed of ore\r\nbegan by usual underground methods from the bottom of a shaft 2,788 feet\r\ndeep but became too difficult because of intense and intricate folding\r\nof the salt beds. Now the salts are being extracted by a method\r\ninvolving solution, wherein river water is introduced into the former\r\nworkings and allowed to stand long enough to dissolve the salts, then\r\nthe brine is pumped out to evaporation ponds, and the valuable potash\r\nsalts are separated from the sodium salts. Closeup views of the mine and\r\nevaporation ponds are seen in figures 70 and 71.\r\n\r\nAs noted earlier, most of the readily recognizable thin beds, such as\r\nthe White Rim Sandstone, pinch out south of here, and figure 31 marks\r\nthe northeasternmost exposure of the Shafer limestone at the top of the\r\nRico Formation. Northeast from here the Rico and overlying Cutler\r\nFormation are not readily separable and are included in the so-called\r\nCutler Formation undifferentiated. This land-laid unit of red sandstone,\r\nsiltstone, and shale is as much as 8,000 feet thick just southwest of\r\nthe ancient Uncompahgre highland (present Uncompahgre Plateau, in\r\nwestern Colorado and eastern Utah), from which it was derived by erosion\r\nduring the Permian Period (fig. 80).\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Orange Cliffs\r\n\r\nThe high mesas west of Canyonlands National Park do not form as distinct\r\na mainland as does Hatch Point, but rather are broken up into a maze of\r\npeninsulas and islands, as shown in figure 1. Owing to the gentle\r\nnorthwestward dip of the rock strata, the altitude of the mesas declines\r\nfrom about 7,000 feet in the south to about 5,300 feet in the north and\r\nnorthwest, where the whole aspect of the country becomes more rounded\r\nand subdued. As shown on the map (fig. 1), however, the name Orange\r\nCliffs is applied to much of the eastward-facing cliffs, which are made\r\nof the Wingate Sandstone capped by the Kayenta Formation. Remnants of\r\nthe Navajo Sandstone increase in number to the north and west, where\r\nremnants of the next two younger rock units—the Carmel Formation and the\r\nEntrada Sandstone—also occur. Thus, the cliff-forming units dip downward\r\nbeneath younger rocks that form the relatively flat Green River Desert\r\nto the northwest, also referred to as the San Rafael Desert. Figure 32\r\nis a view southeastward from The Spur, shown on the map (fig. 1) as the\r\nnorthern section of the Orange Cliffs.\r\n\r\nAt present (1973), the areas west of the Green River and the main stem\r\nof the Colorado River are the least accessible of any in the park and in\r\nthis respect have not changed much since Butch Cassidy and his Wild\r\nBunch roamed the area, except that the former main horse trails are now\r\njeep trails. A secondary road south from the town of Green River goes\r\npast the north side of the Horseshoe Canyon Detached Unit (figs. 1, 2)\r\nand connects with another secondary road to the west, which joins Utah\r\nHighway 24 at Temple Junction, 20 miles north of Hanksville; near\r\nHorseshoe Canyon a jeep trail leads south to the Orange Cliffs. Owing to\r\nblowing sand, these “roads” are not considered reliable for passenger\r\ncars and are best negotiated by four-wheel-drive vehicles or horses.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: VIEW SOUTHEASTWARD FROM THE SPUR, in northern section\r\n    of Orange Cliffs.

Photograph by Parker Hamilton, Flagstaff, Ariz.\r\n    (Fig. 33)]\r\n\r\nAccording to Baker (1971, p. 12), the road leading eastward along North\r\nPoint was used by the Wild Bunch in traveling to French Spring, whence\r\nthey dropped down Millard Canyon (fig. 33) and crossed the Green River\r\nat Bonita Bend, which is just east of Buttes of the Cross (fig. 64).\r\nThey also followed the Old Spanish Trail from the Henry Mountains\r\neastward across the Dirty Devil River, up North Hatch Canyon, across\r\nSunset Pass, and down across the Land of Standing Rocks to Spanish\r\nBottom on the Colorado River (fig. 1). After crossing the river, they\r\nfollowed the trail up Lower Red Lake Canyon (fig. 59) and eastward\r\nthrough The Needles to Monticello.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Benchlands\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White Rim, a broad benchland some 1,000-1,200 feet below the\r\nsouthern half of Island in the Sky, and some of the associated\r\nbenchlands west of the Green River and between the Colorado River and\r\nHatch Point have already been discussed as viewed from Island in the\r\nSky, the White Rim Trail, or Hatch Point. There remain for consideration\r\nseveral other prominent benchlands.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  The Maze and Land of Standing Rocks\r\n\r\nThe Maze, an intricately carved series of canyons and gullies, has been\r\ncalled a “Thirty-square-mile puzzle in sandstone” (Findley, 1971, p.\r\n71-73), and one can readily visualize a king-sized rat struggling in\r\nvain to find a way out. The rock is the Cedar Mesa Sandstone, which here\r\nunderlies red shales beneath the White Rim Sandstone. South of The Maze\r\nan area containing tall spires was appropriately named by the Indians\r\n“_Toom’-pin wu-near’ Tu-weap’_,” or “Land of Standing Rocks” (Powell,\r\n1875, p. 154).\r\n\r\nWest of The Maze is Elaterite Basin, so named because of a dark-brown\r\nelastic mineral resin called elaterite, which seeps from the White Rim\r\nSandstone. One of these seeps is shown in figure 34, and a wedge-shaped\r\nlayer of the sandstone is shown in figure 35. In the Range Canyon area\r\nshown in figure 35, sand was being laid down in an offshore bar at the\r\nleft, while red silts and muds were being deposited on land to the\r\nright. The dark bed just above the White Rim near the middle of the\r\nphotograph is the Hoskinnini Tongue of the Moenkopi Formation, which\r\nintertongues with and pinches out in beds of the Moenkopi Formation to\r\nleft. These are excellent examples of what geologists call facies\r\nchanges.\r\n\r\nSouth of the Land of Standing Rocks are equally colorful areas known as\r\nThe Fins and Ernies Country (named after Ernie Larson, an early-day\r\nsheep man). A prominent row of spires near Cataract Canyon is known as\r\nThe Doll House (fig. 36).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ELATERITE SEEPING FROM WHITE RIM SANDSTONE in\r\n    Elaterite Basin west of The Maze.

(Fig. 36)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Needles district\r\n\r\nThe Needles district is currently (1973) the most highly developed part\r\nof the unfinished park as the result of design, not accident, for this\r\ndistrict includes the greatest number and widest variety of spectacular\r\nfeatures—The Needles proper, The Grabens (pronounced gräbǝns), colossal\r\narches and other erosional forms, large meadows such as Squaw Flat and\r\nChesler and Virginia Parks, a wide variety of prehistoric ruins and\r\npictographs, and Confluence Overlook for viewing the joining of two\r\nmighty rivers—the Green and the Colorado. Like the White Rim and The\r\nMaze, the Needles district is another of the broad benchlands about\r\nmidway between the high mesas and the deep canyons.\r\n\r\nUtah Highway 211, as mentioned already, is a 38-mile-long paved road\r\nleading to the Needles district from U.S. Highway 163 at a point 15\r\nmiles north of Monticello and 18 miles south of La Sal Junction. The\r\nintersection is well marked by Church Rock (fig. 37), a butte of the\r\nEntrada Sandstone. Highway 211 gradually climbs an eastward-dipping\r\nslope of the Navajo Sandstone dotted with a few buttes and patches of\r\nthe Entrada Sandstone, such as Church Rock, and reaches the first of two\r\nsummits 3 miles west of Highway 163. The road crosses a broad gentle\r\nvalley in the Navajo Sandstone, reaches the second summit about 10 miles\r\nfrom the highway, then descends steeply through the Navajo Sandstone and\r\npart of the Kayenta Formation to Indian Creek, 1½ miles below, and\r\nfollows this creek nearly to The Needles. Half a mile down the canyon\r\ntakes us to the top of the cliff-forming Wingate Sandstone, and another\r\nhalf mile brings us to Indian Creek State Park and its striking\r\nNewspaper Rock (fig. 5). Another 1¾ miles takes us to the base of the\r\nWingate and top of the underlying Chinle Formation, which forms the red\r\nslope beneath the cliffs.\r\n\r\nHistoric Dugout Ranch (p. 14) is 19 miles west of the highway, and from\r\nhere a dry-weather road leads southward up north Cottonwood Creek 37\r\nmiles to Beef Basin and connects with roads to Elk Ridge and the Bears\r\nEars, both just west of the Abajo Mountains. Just west of the ranch we\r\nget a good view ahead of two historic landmarks—North and South\r\nSix-Shooter Peaks (fig. 38), so named because of their resemblance to a\r\npair of revolvers pointing skyward. The guns are sculptured from slivers\r\nof Wingate Sandstone resting upon conical mounds of the Chinle. These\r\ncan be seen from a wide area; both appear in figures 38 and 40, and the\r\nnorth one is seen in figure 77.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CHURCH ROCK, standing guard at the intersection of\r\n    U.S. Highway 163 and the east end of Utah Highway 211 leading to the\r\n    Needles district. Rock is Entrada Sandstone: red foundation is Dewey\r\n    Bridge Member; yellowish smooth rounded body of church is Slick Rock\r\n    Member; white steeple is Moab Member. La Sal Mountains at left.\r\n    (Fig. 37)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: NORTH AND SOUTH SIX-SHOOTER PEAKS, looking west from\r\n    entrance road to The Needles. (Fig. 38)]\r\n\r\nA mile west of Dugout Ranch we descend to the top of the Moss Back\r\nMember of the Chinle, a ledge of gray-green sandstone forming the base\r\nof this generally red formation, and reach the base of the member at the\r\ntop of the Moenkopi Formation in the next mile and a half. The Moss Back\r\nis uranium bearing in nearby areas.\r\n\r\nAt 3.8 miles west of Dugout Ranch a poorly marked road on the left\r\ncrosses Indian Creek, then forks; the left-hand fork follows the bed of\r\nLavender Canyon, and the right-hand fork goes into Davis Canyon.\r\nHeadwaters of both these canyons are new additions to the park.\r\n\r\nThe red Organ Rock Tongue of the Cutler Formation is seen about 3 miles\r\nbeyond the turnoff, or about 6 miles west of Dugout Ranch. Another 1½\r\nmiles takes us down in the rock column (fig. 9) to the top of the Cedar\r\nMesa Sandstone. The White Rim Sandstone, which forms such a prominent\r\nbench around the southern part of Island in the Sky (figs. 20-23) and\r\nwest of the Green River, is missing from the Needles district, its place\r\nin the rock column being taken by red shales and sandstones of the\r\nCutler Formation. South of Indian Creek other underlying red beds of the\r\nCutler are gradually replaced in turn by the thick Cedar Mesa Sandstone.\r\nErosion has reduced the general level of the Needles district to or into\r\nthe Cedar Mesa Sandstone, but many streams have cut into the underlying\r\nRico Formation, and the Colorado River has cut also into, and in places\r\nthrough, the limestones of the unnamed upper member of the Hermosa\r\nFormation. Our first view of The Needles is another 4 miles, and 1 more\r\nmile takes us to the park boundary, nearly 32 miles from the U.S.\r\nHighway 163. We pass a road on the right leading to Canyonlands Resort,\r\nand on the left is a new line camp which replaces the restored one at\r\nCave Spring (fig. 6).\r\n\r\nThe unusual features of the Needles district are due in some part to the\r\ncharacter and thickness of the underlying rocks but in large part to\r\nerosion along joints and faults. Joints are fractures along which no\r\ndisplacement has taken place, and faults are fractures along which there\r\nhas been displacement of the two sides relative to one another (fig.\r\n76). The Cedar Mesa Sandstone comprises 500 to 600 feet or more of hard\r\nwell-cemented buff, white, and pink beds of massive sandstone. On the\r\nbasis of the type and amount of deformation and erosion of the Cedar\r\nMesa Sandstone and underlying rocks, the Needles district can be divided\r\ninto three differing areas: (1) an eastern area where the rocks are\r\nrelatively undeformed but are carved into an intricate series of\r\ncanyons, including Salt Canyon and the upper reaches of Davis and\r\nLavender Canyons—the section of the district that contains most of the\r\narches and Indian ruins; (2) The Needles proper, where tensional forces\r\nhave cracked the brittle Cedar Mesa Sandstone into a crazy-quilt pattern\r\nof square to rectangular blocks separated by joints widened by erosion,\r\ncreating a myriad of spires and pinnacles; and (3) The Grabens, where\r\nthe previously jointed rocks were later subjected to additional\r\ntensional forces that produced a series of nearly parallel faults that\r\ntrend northeastward and separate downdropped blocks of rock, called\r\ngrabens, from intervening stationary or upthrown blocks of rock, called\r\nhorsts.\r\n\r\nLet us examine each of these areas in the order named. For traveling to\r\nmost features a four-wheel-drive vehicle is strongly recommended. Some\r\nvisitors negotiate the jeep trails with dune buggies or motorcycles, but\r\nfour-wheel-drive vehicles are considered safer and generally more\r\nreliable. A few trails can be traveled only on foot.\r\n\r\nSquaw Flat, in the western part of the relatively undeformed area, is a\r\nnearly flat area of lower Cedar Mesa Sandstone covered here and there by\r\na thin layer of sparsely vegetated soil and surrounded by generally low\r\nhilly erosional forms in the upper part of the sandstone. Short canyons\r\nand alcoves in the sandstone hills along the west side afford excellent\r\nsemi-private campsites, each of which has its own paved access road,\r\npicnic table, and trash can (fig. 39). Moreover, ground water at shallow\r\ndepth in the underlying sandstone has encouraged the growth of\r\nexceptionally large piñon and juniper trees that provide welcome shade.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SQUAW FLAT CAMPGROUND, in the Needles district, in\r\n    Cedar Mesa Sandstone. Large piñon and juniper trees draw ground\r\n    water from this sandstone. (Fig. 39)]\r\n\r\n\r\n                   SALT, DAVIS, AND LAVENDER CANYONS\r\n\r\nA glance at the southeast corner of the map (fig. 1) shows that most of\r\nthe arches and prehistoric ruins in the park are in Salt Canyon and its\r\nmain tributary, Horse Canyon. A few are in adjacent Davis and Lavender\r\nCanyons, whose headwaters were recently annexed to the park. These\r\ncanyons are accessible only by negotiating the streambeds on\r\nfour-wheel-drive vehicles, horseback, or foot. Salt or Horse Canyons are\r\nbest conquered by four-wheel-drive vehicles plus short hikes in the\r\nnorthern part and long hikes in the southern part.\r\n\r\nAn aerial view (fig. 40) eastward across Salt Canyon shows that erosion\r\nhas produced an intricate series of meandering canyons separated by\r\nrather narrow walls of the Cedar Mesa Sandstone, resembling somewhat The\r\nMaze, west of the Green River.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: AERIAL VIEW EASTWARD ACROSS SALT CANYON. Note narrow\r\n    walls and pinnacles between canyons and alcoves. Six-Shooter Peaks\r\n    are in left background. Photograph by Wayne Alcorn, National Park\r\n    Service. (Fig. 40)]\r\n\r\nThe massive sandstone beds of the Cedar Mesa are composed of sand grains\r\ncemented together by calcium carbonate (CaCO₃), which also forms the\r\nmineral called calcite and the rock known as limestone. Limestone and\r\ncalcite are soluble in acid, even weak acid such as carbonic acid\r\n(H·HCO₃), formed by solution of carbon dioxide (CO₂) in water. Ground\r\nwater, found everywhere in rock openings at differing depths beneath the\r\nsurface, contains considerable dissolved carbon dioxide derived from\r\ndecaying organic matter in soil, from the atmosphere, and from other\r\nsources. Even rain water and snow contain small amounts absorbed from\r\nthe atmosphere—enough to dissolve small amounts of limestone or of\r\ncalcite cement in sandstone. The calcite cement in the Cedar Mesa and\r\nmany other sandstones is unevenly distributed, so the cement is removed\r\nfirst from places that contain the least amounts, and once the cement is\r\ndissolved, the loose sand grains are carried away by gravity, wind, or\r\nwater. Thus, relatively thin walls of sandstone containing irregularly\r\ndistributed patches of soluble cement are prime targets for the\r\nformation of potholes (fig. 46), alcoves, and caves. Once a breakthrough\r\noccurs, weakened chunks from the ceiling tend to fall off, and arches of\r\nvarious shapes are produced, because an arch is naturally the strongest\r\nform that can support the overlying rock load. Man, from the ancient\r\nGreeks, Romans, and Egyptians to modern day, has long made use of arches\r\nin building bridges, aqueducts, temples, cathedrals, and other enduring\r\nedifices. All the spectacular arches we are about to see were carved\r\nfrom the Cedar Mesa Sandstone.\r\n\r\nLet us begin our tour of Salt and Horse Canyons by driving a\r\nfour-wheel-drive vehicle eastward from the fine campground at Squaw\r\nFlat. After about a mile we pass the Wooden Shoe (fig. 41) capping a\r\nridge south of the highway; it contains one of the smallest arches we\r\nwill encounter. Three quarters of a mile east of the temporary ranger\r\nstation we come to Cave Spring, an old restored cowboy line camp\r\npictured in figure 6. This and an adjacent cave containing a spring are\r\npart of the interesting well-marked Environmental Trail, well worth the\r\nhalf hour or so it requires.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WOODEN SHOE, near temporary ranger headquarters, the\r\n    Needles district. Carved in Cedar Mesa Sandstone. (Fig. 41)]\r\n\r\nThe jeep trail up Salt Canyon lies mostly in the sandy bed of Salt Creek\r\nbut includes a few shortcuts across goosenecks and some rough rocky\r\nstretches around rapids or waterfalls. It is best traveled when the\r\ncanyon bottom is moist but not soaked. When the sand is soft and dry, a\r\nshift into four-wheel drive is generally necessary. Signs warn of\r\nquicksand, which occurs when the sand is fully saturated; hence, summer\r\nthundershowers sometimes require delaying or postponing the trip. When\r\nin doubt, consult a park ranger for expected weather and trail\r\nconditions. Thundershowers sometimes occur so suddenly and violently as\r\nto cause serious floods, and the “road” is closed when heavy rain is\r\nexpected. However, if an unexpected storm occurs while you are up in the\r\ncanyon, try to reach high ground and wait until the flood subsides. If\r\nyou do not have time to get your vehicle out of the flood’s path, at\r\nleast get yourself and passengers to a safe spot.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PAUL BUNYANS POTTY, on east wall of Horse Canyon.\r\n    (Fig. 42)]\r\n\r\nTwo and a half miles south of Cave Spring we reach the confluence with\r\nHorse Canyon, marked by a sign at the Y giving distances to points of\r\ninterest up each canyon. Let us try Horse Canyon first. After about a\r\nmile we pass Paul Bunyans Potty on the left—one of the most aptly titled\r\nfeatures of the park (fig. 42). Two miles south of the Y is Keyhole\r\nRuin, nestled in a cleft high on the cliff to our left—a granary built\r\nby the Anasazi. Here we face another Y. The left fork leads half a mile\r\neast to Tower Ruin (fig. 4), one of the largest and best preserved\r\nAnasazi granaries in the park. The right fork takes us on up Horse\r\nCanyon, and in about 2 miles we pass Gothic Arch on the right. In 2 more\r\nmiles, 4 miles from Salt Canyon, a short hike up the tributary to the\r\nright leads to Castle Arch and Thirteen Faces. Assuming we have taken\r\nphotographs of the important features along the way, it probably is\r\nabout time to return to camp at Squaw Flat, unless we choose to spend\r\nthe night at Peek-a-boo Spring and primitive campground in Salt Canyon,\r\nabout 1.2 miles above the confluence with Horse Canyon.\r\n\r\nAnother drive takes us up Salt Canyon 8½ miles past the confluence with\r\nHorse Canyon to another confluence and Y, which has a primitive campsite\r\nwithout water. One mile up the left, or southeast, tributary is a\r\nparking area where we begin the ½-mile walk to Angel Arch, considered by\r\nmany people to be the most beautiful and spectacular arch in the park if\r\nnot in the entire canyon country. Angel Arch was drawn for the front\r\ncover by John R. Stacy and is pictured in figure 43.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ANGEL ARCH, along tributary of Salt Canyon. (Fig.\r\n    43)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: FISHEYE ARCH, along upper Salt Canyon, looking north.\r\n    Photograph by National Park Service. (Fig. 44)]\r\n\r\nFrom the last Y we can proceed only about 2½ miles farther up main Salt\r\nCanyon by vehicle, and the remaining features shown on the map (fig. 1)\r\ncan be reached only on foot. The All American Man, a unique pictograph\r\nreferred to earlier (fig. 3), is about 3½ miles up the canyon. Those\r\nhardy souls who wish to hike many additional miles to the head of Salt\r\nCanyon will be rewarded with views of four additional arches and several\r\nruins. Two of these arches are shown in figures 44 and 45.\r\n\r\nThe more adventuresome may wish to explore upper Lavender and Davis\r\nCanyons by driving up the sand washes in a four-wheel-drive vehicle, but\r\ninquiry should be made from a park ranger regarding access to the canyon\r\nmouths and condition of the washes. Hand Holt Arch (fig. 46) and Cleft\r\nArch (fig. 47) are two of the rewarding sights in Lavender Canyon, and\r\nfigure 48 shows one of the arches in Davis Canon.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WEDDING RING ARCH, along upper Salt Canyon.\r\n    Photograph by National Park Service.

(Fig.\r\n    49)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CHESLER PARK IN THE NEEDLES, aerial view looking\r\n    northeast. Photograph by Walter Meayers Edwards, © 1971 National\r\n    Geographic Society. (Fig. 50)]\r\n\r\nThe northeastern edge of The Needles proper can be seen from Squaw Flat\r\n(fig. 49), but the true character of The Needles can be appreciated\r\nbetter from the air (fig. 50). You cannot get far into The Needles\r\nwithout traversing part of The Grabens, so we will consider them\r\ntogether. An aerial oblique view (fig. 51) shows The Needles in the\r\nforeground and The Grabens in the middle background. As shown on the map\r\n(fig. 1), you can hike into The Needles and The Grabens from Squaw Flat,\r\nbut let us make the trip using a four-wheel-drive vehicle and several\r\nshort hikes.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE NEEDLES AND THE GRABENS, aerial oblique view\r\n    looking west over Chesler Park in foreground, The Grabens to the\r\n    right, and Cataract Canyon behind. Photograph by U.S. Army Air\r\n    Force. (Fig. 51)]\r\n\r\nOrdinary passenger cars now can go 2¾ miles west of Squaw Flat to Soda\r\nSpring, at the east base of Elephant Hill, but beyond Soda Spring\r\nfour-wheel-drive vehicles should be used. Some people conquer the hill\r\nin dune buggies or on motorcycles, but this is considered quite\r\ndangerous. Both sides of this short (1¼ miles) but formidable hill have\r\nswitchback curves too sharp to negotiate in the regular manner, so\r\nspecial driving techniques must be followed. On the east side, you must\r\ndrive out on a flat rock, jockey back and forth until turned completely\r\naround, then proceed up the hill. On the west side, you descend a\r\n40-percent grade to a shelf, _back_ down a narrow stretch of about\r\n30-percent grade and back sharply to the left onto a flat rock, then go\r\nforward again. On the return trip the whole procedure is carried out in\r\nreverse order.\r\n\r\nWest of Elephant Hill, the road reaches a Y, at which you must turn left\r\non a one-way road; the right-hand road is for later one-way return to\r\nthe Y. Why the left-hand fork is one way soon becomes apparent, for the\r\nroad leads into a narrow shallow graben, called Devils Pocket (fig. 51),\r\nbetween rock walls, and is barely wide enough for one car. After about 2\r\nmiles the graben widens out into a beautiful spot called the Devils\r\nKitchen, which contains several picnic tables tucked into shady recesses\r\nin the sandstone walls. This is the starting point for two trails\r\nleading southward by different routes to Chesler Park, from which other\r\ntrails lead to Druid Arch or back to Squaw Flat.\r\n\r\nFrom the Devils Kitchen, the road turns abruptly westward for about half\r\na mile to another Y in about the middle of Devils Lane, one of the\r\nlarger grabens and one of two whose entire length is traversed by roads,\r\nas shown on the map (fig. 1). Only the left fork is a two-way road, so\r\nlet us take the left fork 2¾ miles southwestward to the next road\r\njunction. About halfway down Devils Lane, a fault crossing the graben\r\nhas created a narrow steep ridge appropriately called SOB Hill, because\r\nthe road over it creates a challenge that some vehicles fail to meet on\r\nthe first attempt!\r\n\r\nThe next road intersection is now shown on the map (fig. 1) as a sharp\r\nturn leading southwest to Ruin Park and Beef Basin. The abandoned left\r\nfork (not shown) leads east into Chesler Park. This park, shown in\r\nfigure 50 and near the bottom of figure 51, is a beautiful natural\r\nmeadow of several hundred acres fenced by a natural wall of needles and\r\ncontaining a central island of needles. Because of vehicular damage to\r\nmeadow vegetation, the National Park Service found it necessary to close\r\nthe road. To reach Chesler Park now, vehicles must go right a short\r\ndistance to the Chesler Canyon turnoff, then left about half a mile to a\r\nparking area. From here, a ½-mile hike east through the narrow Joint\r\nTrail gets us to the south side of Chesler Park, where we join the\r\nabandoned road to reach the northeast corner of the park and the trails\r\ninto The Needles proper (fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThis change adds 1¾ miles (one way) to the hike to Druid Arch, making\r\nthe round trip about 11½ miles. At the old trailhead, near the northeast\r\ncorner of Chesler Park, is a sign proclaiming the need for rubber-soled\r\nshoes and water, and I strongly support these admonitions, for much of\r\nthe hike is on bare smooth sandstone and includes steep slopes and\r\n_generally_ dry waterfalls. The hike should not be attempted by anyone\r\nnot in good physical condition, and it should not be undertaken alone;\r\ntwo or more people should travel together.\r\n\r\nAs shown in figure 52, the trail to Druid Arch from Chesler Park starts\r\nout on bare Cedar Mesa Sandstone marked by a succession of rock cairns,\r\ntwo of which are visible and without which the trail would soon be lost.\r\nThe trail drops rapidly down into Elephant Canyon, which is then\r\nfollowed southward 2 miles to the arch. This canyon has cut through the\r\nCedar Mesa into the underlying Rico Formation, and much of the canyon is\r\nquite narrow and steep sided, as shown in figure 53. Although much of\r\nthe Rico consists of red beds laid down above sea level by ancient\r\nstreams, the trail crosses several thin beds of dark-gray hard limestone\r\ncontaining fossil marine seashells and ancient sea anemones whose\r\noriginal calcium carbonate parts have been locally replaced by jasper\r\n(red iron-bearing silica). When at last the weary hiker makes the steep\r\nclimb out of the canyon and rounds the final bare-rock curve, the sudden\r\nand striking view of Druid Arch (fig. 54) seems worth every bit of the\r\neffort—at least it was to me and my hiking companion.\r\n\r\nAfter my friend and I hiked to Druid Arch and after the length of this\r\nroute was increased to a round-trip distance of 11½ miles, a new route\r\nwas constructed having a round-trip length of only 8½ miles. This new\r\ntrail starts at the end of the passenger-car road at the east edge of\r\nElephant Hill, goes 1¼ miles southwest to join an older trail in\r\nElephant Canyon, then follows this canyon 3 miles south to the arch.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: TRAIL TO DRUID ARCH, near its beginning at northeast\r\n    corner of Chesler Park, marked only by rock cairns, two of which are\r\n    visible. (Fig. 52)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: UPPER ELEPHANT CANYON, containing trail to Druid\r\n    Arch. (Fig. 53)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: DRUID ARCH, from end of arduous trail shown in\r\n    figures 52 and 53. (Fig. 54)]\r\n\r\nAfter returning to our vehicle west of Chesler Park and backtracking\r\nover SOB Hill to the intersection in the middle of Devils Lane, let us\r\nproceed northward on a one-way road to and beyond the Silver Stairs for\r\na closer look at Devils Lane and other grabens to the west and for a\r\nlook at the confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers. But first let\r\nus pause and reflect upon the possible origin of The Grabens.\r\n\r\nGeologists have different opinions as to just how grabens and complex\r\nsystems of joints have formed, but all seem to agree that tensional\r\nforces were involved. Some think that solution of salt and gypsum from\r\nthe Paradox Member of the Hermosa Formation by ground-water movement\r\nallowed the brittle Cedar Mesa Sandstone and other overlying rocks to\r\nsag, producing tension cracks and faults. Others believe that removal of\r\nthe salt and gypsum occurred by plastic flowage toward the Meander\r\nanticline (see p. 108 and fig. 61), whose axis follows the Colorado\r\nRiver southwest from The Loop, past the confluence, and to and beyond\r\nSpanish Bottom. Some suppose that compaction due to the weight of the\r\nabnormally thick pile of sedimentary rock underlying the area may have\r\ncaused the sagging, cracking, and faulting. The rock deformation may\r\nhave resulted from a combination of these and possibly other things, of\r\ncourse, but whatever the cause, the resulting features are very\r\nstriking. There was room to show only two of the named grabens within\r\nthe park on the map (fig. 1), but all are shown in figure 51, and\r\nseveral appear in figure 59. A diagramatic cross section of a typical\r\ngraben is shown in figure 55. The tension faults shown in figures 55 and\r\n56 are called normal faults, in contrast to faults formed by horizontal\r\ncompression, which are called reverse faults (figs. 75, 76).\r\n\r\nThe Grabens range in width from about 7 or 8 feet at the north end of\r\nDevils Pocket to nearly 2,000 feet at the south end of Red Lake Canyon,\r\nbut the average width is about 500 feet. The floors of The Grabens are\r\ncovered by soil and grass, but the displacement along the faults is\r\nbelieved to approximate the height of the walls—nearly 300 feet. That\r\nThe Grabens are of fairly recent origin is attested by the fact that\r\nmost of the walls are vertical fault faces showing little sign of\r\nerosion (fig. 57); that no through drainage has yet been established in\r\nCyclone Canyon, which is a series of basins with low divides between;\r\nand that several pre-existing streams were interrupted or diverted by\r\nthe faulting.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: A SIMPLE GRABEN, formed by tension in directions\r\n    indicated by horizontal arrows. Downdropped central block is the\r\n    graben; stationary or uplifted blocks on sides are called horsts.\r\n    From Hansen (1969, p. 123). See also figure 76. (Fig. 55)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: CUTAWAY VIEW OF NORMAL FAULT, resulting from tension\r\n    in and lengthening of the earth’s crust. Note amount of displacement\r\n    and repetition of strata. Compare with figure 76. From Hansen (1969,\r\n    p. 116). (Fig. 56)]\r\n\r\nNow let us continue our journey northward along Devils Lane. Just before\r\nreaching the Silver Stairs we may wish to pause long enough to take in\r\nthe distant view to the northwest toward Junction Butte and Grand View\r\nPoint. (See frontispiece.) After descending the steep Silver Stairs in a\r\nnarrow cleft between rock walls, we reach another intersection: a\r\ntwo-way road continuing northwest goes to our destination, and a one-way\r\nroad turning right returns to Elephant Hill via part of Elephant Canyon\r\n(fig. 58).\r\n\r\nAbout 2 miles to the northwest we cross the north end of Cyclone Canyon,\r\nthe largest graben. It contains a road 3½ miles long and is well worth\r\nseeing. About one-half mile from the south end, an old trail follows Red\r\nLake and Lower Red Lake Canyons to the Colorado River across from\r\nSpanish Bottom (figs. 1, 61).\r\n\r\nFrom near the north end of Cyclone Canyon (figs. 1, 59), we drive west\r\nthree-fourths mile to a parking area and hike one-half mile to an\r\noverlook for a spectacular view of the confluence of the Green and\r\nColorado Rivers (figs. 59, 60) and of the northern part of Cataract\r\nCanyon (fig. 61). These and other canyons are discussed in the next\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: WEST WALL OF CYCLONE CANYON GRABEN, a nearly vertical\r\n    fault face showing little sign of erosion.

(Fig. 61)]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCanyons of the Green and Colorado Rivers\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have discussed two of the three major topographic divisions of the\r\npark—the high mesas and the benchlands—and there remains to consider the\r\nthird division—the canyons of the mighty Green and Colorado Rivers and\r\nsome of their tributaries. After we discuss a few features common to\r\nboth rivers, we will take up the details of each river.\r\n\r\nA glance at the map (fig. 1) shows that above the confluence both rivers\r\nare very crooked and contain many loops, or meanders, the most striking\r\nof which are Bowknot Bend of the Green River (fig. 62), several miles\r\nnorth of the park, and The Loop of the Colorado River (fig. 74). In\r\ncontrast, the main stem of the Colorado River below the confluence is\r\nconsiderably straighter. Not apparent on the map are the facts that the\r\ncrooked rivers above the confluence have very gentle grades and are free\r\nfrom rapids or falls, whereas a few miles south of the confluence the\r\nmain stem plunges into Cataract Canyon—the steepest and wildest reach of\r\nthe river, containing 64 rapids. These differences are partly explicable\r\non the basis of the geologic structure and character of the rocks\r\nthrough which the rivers have cut. Above the confluence, the soft strata\r\ndip gently northward, so in flowing generally southward the two rivers\r\nare cutting “against the grain,” which tends to impede their flow and\r\nthus reduce their grades. Below the confluence, the hard limestones of\r\nthe Hermosa Formation lie relatively flat for several miles and then\r\nbegin to dip gently southward, thus allowing the river to cut “with the\r\ngrain” and therefore drop more rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe quiet, smooth waters above the confluence permit power boating\r\nbetween the towns of Green River, Utah, and Moab during part of the\r\nyear, whereas the rapids below Spanish Bottom, 3½ miles below the\r\nconfluence, restrict river travel to float trips using sturdy boats or\r\nrafts.\r\n\r\nAbove the confluence, a so-called Friendship Cruise is run each year\r\nduring the Memorial Day weekend. Participants tow their own power boats\r\non trailers to the town of Green River, and after the boats are\r\nlaunched, facilities are available at nominal cost for transporting cars\r\nand boat trailers to Moab to await the arrival of the boats. Although\r\nsome high-powered speedboats are reported to have made the run down the\r\nGreen River to the confluence then up the Colorado River to Moab in a\r\nfew hours, the trip for most boats requires 2 to 7 days.\r\n\r\nTrips by power boats, including jet boats, can be arranged from either\r\nGreen River or Moab. Some passengers from Moab return by jeep from\r\nLathrop Canyon via the White Rim Trail, and some from Green River return\r\non land via the Horsethief Trail. Many prefer the quieter float trip\r\ndown to the confluence, with return to either town by a prescheduled\r\npower boat, and some more adventurous souls float through the rapids of\r\nCataract Canyon all the way to Lake Powell.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1972, a 93-foot 150-passenger stern-wheeler (fig. 69)\r\nbegan passenger service on the Colorado River from just above Potash to\r\nthe foot of Dead Horse Point and return (Lansford, 1972).\r\n\r\n\r\n                     Entrenched and cutoff meanders\r\n\r\nMeanders such as those above the confluence generally are formed by\r\nstreams flowing in soft alluvium consisting of clay, silt, and sand,\r\nsuch as along the Mississippi River below Cairo, Ill. But there is no\r\nsoft alluvium along the Colorado and Green Rivers, so how did these\r\nmeanders form? They probably attained their serpentine shape while\r\ncutting in softer, younger material, which long ago was removed by\r\nerosion, and then continued to cut their crooked channels down, until\r\nthey created the deep rock-walled canyons in which they now flow as\r\n“entrenched” meanders.\r\n\r\nMeandering streams tend to shorten their lengths from time to time by\r\ncutting through narrow walls between adjacent loops, leaving abandoned\r\nhorseshoe-shaped channels or lakes. In most of the United States these\r\nare known as oxbows or cutoff meanders, but in the desert Southwest they\r\nare commonly called by the Spanish term “rincon.” Cutoffs are common\r\nalong soft alluvial channels such as the lower Mississippi River valley\r\nbut are rare along channels whose meanders are entrenched into hard\r\nrock. Thus, there have been many natural (and several manmade) cutoffs\r\nalong the lower Mississippi during historic times, but the most recent\r\nones along the Green and upper Colorado Rivers probably occurred a\r\nmillion or so years ago, during the Pleistocene Epoch (figs. 65, 80).\r\n\r\nMark Twain served several years as an expert riverboat pilot on the\r\nMississippi River during which several cutoffs took place. Chapter 27 of\r\nhis “Life on the Mississippi” contains sage references to both natural\r\nand artificial cutoffs and concludes with a few good-natured jibes at\r\ngeologists in particular and scientists in general:\r\n\r\n  Therefore the Mississippi between Cairo and New Orleans was twelve\r\n  hundred and fifteen miles long one hundred and seventy six years ago.\r\n  It was eleven hundred and eighty after the cutoff of 1722. It was one\r\n  thousand and forty after the American Bend cut-off. It has lost\r\n  sixty-seven miles since. Consequently, its length is only nine hundred\r\n  and seventy-three miles at present.\r\n\r\n  Now, if I wanted to be one of those ponderous scientific people, and\r\n  “let on” to prove what had occurred in the remote past by what had\r\n  occurred in a given time in the recent past, or what will occur in the\r\n  far future by what has occurred in late years, what an opportunity is\r\n  here! Geology never had such a chance, nor such exact data to argue\r\n  from! Nor “development of species,” either! Glacial epochs are great\r\n  things, but they are vague—vague. Please observe:\r\n\r\n  In the space of one hundred and seventy-six years the Lower\r\n  Mississippi has shortened itself two hundred and forty two miles. That\r\n  is an average of a trifle over one mile and a third per year.\r\n  Therefore, any calm person, who is not blind or idiotic, can see that\r\n  in the Old Oölitic Silurian Period, just a million years ago next\r\n  November, the Lower Mississippi River was upward of one million three\r\n  hundred thousand miles long, and stuck out over the Gulf of Mexico\r\n  like a fishing rod. And by the same token any person can see that\r\n  seven hundred and forty-two years from now the Lower Mississippi will\r\n  be only a mile and three-quarters long, and Cairo and New Orleans will\r\n  have joined their streets together, and be plodding comfortably along\r\n  under a single mayor and a mutual board of aldermen. There is\r\n  something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns\r\n  of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              Green River\r\n\r\nMuch more has been written about the Green River and the main stem of\r\nthe Colorado than about the Colorado above the confluence (the former\r\nGrand River), because all but one of the early float trips began on the\r\nGreen. The first reports concerning Powell’s memorable voyages of 1869\r\nand 1871 were his articles published in Scribners Monthly during 1874\r\nand 1875 followed by his formal 1875 report “Exploration of the Colorado\r\nRiver of the West and Its Tributaries.” As pointed out by Porter (1969,\r\np. 21), however, Powell’s narrative\r\n\r\n  is written _as if_ everything chronicled therein occurred during the\r\n  first trip. Events which actually occurred in 1871 and 1872 are\r\n  reported as happening in 1869. There is no mention of the personnel of\r\n  the 1871-72 party, nor is there an indication that there even _was_ a\r\n  second trip. The engravings illustrating the report were made from\r\n  photographs taken by Beaman and Hillers between 1871 and 1874, but\r\n  this fact is not noted.\r\n\r\nFor these reasons, Porter’s account contains Powell’s diary of the first\r\n(1869) trip and many of the missing photographs, plus his own beautiful\r\ncolor prints. Much more complete and accurate accounts of the 1871\r\nvoyage than those of Powell, including many of the photographs taken by\r\nBeaman and Hillers, were given by Dellenbaugh (1902, 1962), who was a\r\nmember of Powell’s 1871 expedition.\r\n\r\nNumerous river trips were undertaken in the years following Powell’s\r\npioneering expeditions. The ill-fated Brown-Stanton voyage of 1889-90\r\nincluded starts on both the Grand and the Green Rivers. (See section on\r\n“Colorado River.”) More successful were Nathan Galloway and William\r\nRichmond, trappers who left Henrys Fork, Wyo., late in 1896 and reached\r\nNeedles, Calif., on February 10, 1897 (Kolb, 1927, p. 338). Trappers\r\nCharles S. Russell, E. R. Monette, and Bert Loper left Green River,\r\nUtah, in three steel boats on September 20, 1907; Russell and Monette\r\nreached Needles in one boat in February 1908, but Loper was drowned.\r\nDellenbaugh’s 1902 book was carried by the Kolb brothers as a guide for\r\ntheir 1911 trip down the river (Kolb, 1927). In addition to making\r\nsuperb still photographs, the Kolb brothers took the first moving\r\npictures in the canyons, and these are still being shown in the Kolb\r\nStudio on the South Rim of the Grand Canyon. Julius F. Stone and party\r\ntraversed the canyons in 1909, and his account (1932) also contains\r\nexcellent photographs. E. C. La Rue, of the U.S. Geological Survey, and\r\nassistants made two trips down the Green and Colorado Rivers in 1914 and\r\n1915 and additional trips from 1921 through 1924. Their comprehensive\r\nhydrographic findings and studies, plus excellent photographs, are given\r\nin two reports (La Rue, 1916, 1925). The 1916 report also contains (p.\r\n16-22) a good condensed account of earlier explorations and voyages from\r\n1531 through 1911, taken in part from Dellenbaugh (1902).\r\n\r\nAs noted earlier, a modern river runners’ guide by Mutschler (1969),\r\nwhich logs the Green and Colorado Rivers from Green River, Utah, to Lake\r\nPowell, is now available. River mileages in this log were taken from\r\ndetailed topographic maps of both rivers prepared under the direction of\r\nHerron (1917). We will visit only a few notable features of the canyons;\r\nthe mile-by-mile details for the Green River can be obtained from\r\nMutschler (1969), and those for the Colorado River, from Baars and\r\nMolenaar (1971, p. 61-99). Several other references are given below, and\r\nadditional ones are given by Rabbitt (1969, p. 20-21).\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BOWKNOT BEND, of Green River, looking east from west\r\n    end of narrow intervening saddle. Upper photograph was taken by E.\r\n    O. Beaman on September 10, 1871, during second voyage of Major John\r\n    Wesley Powell and his party. Lower photograph was taken from same\r\n    camera station on August 19, 1968, by Hal G. Stephens, U.S.\r\n    Geological Survey, on expedition led by E. M. Shoemaker to recover\r\n    camera stations of the 1871 voyage and rephotograph the scenes to\r\n    record changes during the nearly 100 year interval. Note that almost\r\n    no changes occurred in the bedrock, or even in the loose rocks, but\r\n    that considerable change occurred in the vegetation along the river.\r\n    Although salt cedar (tamarisk) had been introduced into this country\r\n    from the Mediterranean area long before 1871, it had not yet spread\r\n    to this area, but the bare islands shown in the earlier photograph\r\n    are covered by salt cedar in the 1968 photograph. (Fig. 62)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Figure 62, lower image]\r\n\r\nAll travelers down the Green River embarking from Green River, Utah, or\r\nabove, were impressed with Bowknot Bend (fig. 62), so named by Powell\r\nand his men (1875, p. 54) near the beginning of Labyrinth Canyon, which\r\nthey also named for its deeply entrenched meanders. The upper photograph\r\nin figure 62 was taken by Beaman on September 10, 1871, looking eastward\r\nfrom the west end of the narrow saddle separating the upper and lower\r\nreaches of the river; the lower photograph was taken from the same point\r\non August 19, 1968, by Hal G. Stephens nearly 97 years later. Although\r\nthere are changes in the vegetation, as described in the caption, there\r\nare virtually no visible changes in the bedrock. Nevertheless, the\r\ndistant future will likely see a breakthrough, whereby Green River will\r\nshorten itself by about 7 miles (Herron, 1917, pl. 15C). It is\r\ninteresting to note that the vertical cliffs of Wingate Sandstone in and\r\nwest of Bowknot Bend are only a few hundred feet above the river,\r\nwhereas, because of the gentle northward dip of the beds and the gentle\r\nsouthward grade of the rivers, the Wingate cliffs are more than 2,000\r\nfeet above the two rivers at Grand View Point and Junction Butte, at the\r\nsouthern tip of Island in the Sky.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of Horseshoe Canyon, about 3 miles below Bowknot Bend, we\r\npass a large rincon where the Green River shortened its course by about\r\n3 miles. Some idea of the rincon’s antiquity is gained from the facts\r\nthat the river is now some 350 feet lower than at cutoff time, whereas\r\nBowknot Bend (fig. 62) has shown no visible deepening in 97 years. This\r\nrincon was not noted by Powell or other early voyagers, seemingly\r\nbecause they did not happen to climb the banks at this point, but it is\r\nquite noticeable on modern topographic maps and on aerial photographs.\r\nThis rincon and Jackson Hole along the Colorado River may be as old as\r\nlate Tertiary (fig. 80).\r\n\r\nAt a point reported to be 350 yards above the mouth of Hell Roaring\r\nCanyon, which enters from the east about 3½ miles below the rincon, an\r\nearly day trapper named Julien left his mark. Stone (1932, p. 69, pl.\r\n39A) seems to have been the first river runner to find (from a\r\ndescription given him by a Mr. Wheeler at Green River), record, and\r\nphotograph the inscription shown in figure 63. Mutschler (1969, p. 31)\r\nindicated that this inscription is carved on a massive Moenkopi\r\nsandstone bed about 40 feet above the canyon floor. A similar\r\ninscription by Julien was found in Cataract Canyon, 31 miles below the\r\nconfluence, but it is now covered by Lake Powell (Mutschler, 1969, p.\r\n65).\r\n\r\nSome boaters are met by car and taken out to Moab or Green River via the\r\nHorsethief Trail (fig. 1), just north of the park. The road along the\r\nriver here continues south for 6½ miles to the mouths of Taylor and\r\nUpheaval Canyons, where it becomes the White Rim Trail.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: INSCRIPTION BY JULIEN, near mouth of Hell Roaring\r\n    Canyon, thought to have been carved by Dennis Julien, an early day\r\n    trapper. Photograph by K. Sawyer, August 1914, member of expedition\r\n    led by E. C. La Rue (1916). (Fig. 63)]\r\n\r\nComing down the Green River, we enter Canyonlands National Park where\r\nthe Grand-San Juan county line meets the Emery-Wayne county line (fig.\r\n1), about 2¼ miles north of Taylor and Upheaval Canyons. The National\r\nPark Service had three successful test wells put down in Taylor Canyon,\r\nand water under artesian pressure was found in the White Rim Sandstone\r\nat depths of 373 to 482 feet. When funds become available, they hope to\r\ncomplete one or more of these wells and pump the water up to Island in\r\nthe Sky, where two dry holes were drilled earlier.\r\n\r\nAbout 5½ miles below Upheaval Canyon is an interesting ruin on a hill in\r\nthe middle of a large nearly closed loop of the river enclosing Fort\r\nBottom. This was noted by Dellenbaugh (1902) during Powell’s 1871 trip\r\nand was described in more detail by Mutschler (1969, p. 33-34):\r\n\r\n  The ruin consists of two, two-story, interconnected, crudely circular\r\n  towers, and a third separate, completely collapsed tower, built on the\r\n  summit of the bluff with a commanding view downriver and of Fort\r\n  Bottom. Other collapsed structures are present on the summit, and a\r\n  slab-lined cist is present beneath the Moss Back ledge west of the\r\n  towers. The ruin was built of dry laid masonry and most of the mud\r\n  plaster on the inside has been washed away, leaving the structure in\r\n  danger of imminent collapse. Please do not climb the walls!\r\n\r\nFort Bottom also contains a cabin believed to have been used by Butch\r\nCassidy and the Wild Bunch (Baker, 1971, p. 198).\r\n\r\nAt about the mouth of Millard Canyon, we leave Labyrinth Canyon and\r\nenter Stillwater Canyon, aptly named by members of the 1869 Powell\r\nvoyage (Dellenbaugh, 1902, p. 276). The beginning of Stillwater Canyon\r\nis marked by vertical walls of the White Rim Sandstone. From here\r\nPowell’s men observed a butte to the southwest thought to resemble a\r\nfallen cross and named it “Butte of the Cross.” Farther downstream they\r\nrealized they had been looking at two buttes, a small one in front of a\r\nlarger one, so the feature was renamed “Buttes of the Cross.” An aerial\r\nview of Buttes of the Cross is shown in figure 64.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: BUTTES OF THE CROSS, looking southwest from the air.\r\n    Millard Canyon enters Green River in foreground, North Point is in\r\n    right middle ground, Orange Cliffs are in background, and Henry\r\n    Mountains form right skyline. White Rim Sandstone forms White Rim\r\n    near mouth of Millard Canyon and near Anderson Bottom at left\r\n    middle. (See fig. 65.) Buttes are Wingate Sandstone capped by\r\n    Kayenta Formation; slopes down to prominent ledge are Chinle\r\n    Formation, Moss Back Member forming the ledge; steep and gentle\r\n    slopes between ledge and White Rim are Moenkopi Formation.\r\n    Photograph by National Park Service. (Fig. 64)]\r\n\r\nAbout 2 miles below the mouth of Millard Canyon, at Anderson Bottom, we\r\nreach one of the most interesting features on the river—the most recent\r\nrincon of a major river in the park, if not in the entire canyon\r\ncountry. Although some rincons are more recent, they are along minor\r\ntributaries such as Indian Creek (fig. 73). The cutoff at Anderson\r\nBottom probably took place during the Pleistocene Epoch, whereas most of\r\nthe others along the main rivers probably occurred during the Tertiary\r\nPeriod (fig. 80). An aerial view of the Anderson Bottom rincon is shown\r\nin figure 65, and a sketch of the drainage change is shown in figure 66.\r\nThis feature was noted and correctly interpreted by Powell and his men,\r\nwho applied the name Bonita Bend to the sharp new course the river took\r\nafter the cutoff.\r\n\r\nContinuing through Stillwater Canyon, we pass Turks Head (figs. 23, 24)\r\nand head for the confluence of the Green River with the Colorado River.\r\nFigure 67 shows the canyon just west of the confluence. The lowest and\r\nlargest cliff above the river is the upper member of the Hermosa\r\nFormation, overlain by the slopes and thin ledges of the Rico Formation.\r\nThe massive sandstone at the top of the canyon wall is the Cedar Mesa.\r\nJunction Butte and Grand View Point are on the right skyline.\r\n\r\nWe have already viewed the confluence and Cataract Canyon from the land\r\nand from the air (figs. 59-61); soon we will see them from the Colorado\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Petroglyph]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: ANDERSON BOTTOM RINCON, aerial view looking\r\n    southeast.

The Grand (Colorado) River above the confluence was\r\nneglected for some 18 years after Powell’s second voyage, until, in\r\n1889, Frank M. Brown organized a company for construction of the\r\nproposed Denver, Colorado Canyon, and Pacific Railway. This railroad was\r\nto carry coal from mines in Colorado over a “water-level” line through\r\nthe canyons of the Colorado River to the Gulf of California some 1,200\r\nmiles away; from there the coal would presumably be shipped to ports as\r\nfar north as San Francisco (Dellenbaugh, 1902, p. 343-369). On March 26,\r\n1889, Brown, president, F. C. Kendrick, chief engineer, and T. P.\r\nRigney, assistant engineer, drove the first stake for a survey of the\r\nnew line at Grand Junction, Colo., then Brown left for the East to\r\nobtain financing, and the other two plus some hired hands took off down\r\nthe Grand River. After reaching the confluence they towed the boat up\r\nthe Green River, thus becoming the first to make this trip upstream.\r\nThey nearly ran out of food, but thanks to the hospitality of some\r\ncattlemen, they replenished their stock and after about 9 days reached\r\nthe railroad at Green River, Utah. Brown, who had returned from the\r\nEast, his newly appointed chief engineer, Robert Brewster Stanton, and\r\n14 others in six ill-designed boats of cedar, rather than oak, left\r\nGreen River on May 25, 1889. Against the advice of Major Powell and A.\r\nH. Thompson, Powell’s topographer on the 1871 trip, they carried no life\r\npreservers. After many mishaps, Brown and two others were drowned near\r\nthe head of Marble Canyon, and the ill-fated expedition was temporarily\r\nhalted. However, the indefatigable Stanton contracted for new boats\r\nbuilt of oak and, with a reorganized party of 12, left the mouth of the\r\nFremont (Dirty Devil) River on November 25. After many further mishaps,\r\nthe party finally reached the Gulf of California on April 26, 1890.\r\nNeedless to say the proposed railway was not built.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Colorado River enters Canyonlands National Park about 33\r\nriver miles below Moab, most boaters or floaters begin their voyage\r\neither at Moab or near Potash, and most travelers of the White Rim Trail\r\nbegin at Moab, so we will start our trip at Moab. No logs or river\r\nrunners’ guides are available as yet for the reach from Moab to Potash,\r\nbut below Potash some details of the geology have been described by\r\nBaars in Baars and Molenaar (1971, p. 59-87).\r\n\r\nAs noted at the beginning of this chapter, above the confluence both the\r\nGreen and Colorado Rivers are very crooked, have very low grades, and\r\nare free from rapids. As with the Green, the soft rocks along the\r\nColorado have a generally low northward dip that partly explains the\r\nriver’s gentle grade and its southward flow through increasingly lower\r\nand older strata. Unlike the Green, however, the gentle dips of the\r\nstrata in the canyons of the Colorado are interrupted by several gentle\r\nanticlinal (fig. 14) and synclinal (fig. 26) folds and by at least one\r\nfault. The most important of these geologic structures and other\r\nfeatures will be noted as we journey down the river.\r\n\r\nThe first 14 miles from Moab Valley to Potash can be made either by\r\nriver or by paved Utah Highway 279. This highway leaves U.S. Highway 163\r\nnear the uranium ore-reduction plant several miles northwest of Moab,\r\nleaves Moab Valley through The Portal (fig. 68), and follows the west\r\nbank of the river. A paved secondary road from Moab follows the east\r\nbank of the river through The Portal and through Kings Bottom, where it\r\ncrosses the Kings Bottom syncline, to the mouth of Kane Springs Canyon,\r\nthen becomes a gravel road that ascends this canyon southward to and\r\nbeyond Hurrah Pass (fig. 30). High above this road north of Kings Bottom\r\nare petroglyphs and a few cliff dwellings in the vertical cliffs of\r\nWingate Sandstone. A ranch “house” at Kings Bottom has been excavated\r\nentirely into the Wingate cliff. Convenient turnouts have been provided\r\nat several places along Highway 279 for viewing petroglyphs or other\r\npoints of interest. Small viewing tubes welded to vertical steel posts\r\nhaving signs help visitors locate and see the features described.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE PORTAL, in south wall of Moab Valley, through\r\n    which the Colorado River, Utah Highway 279 (on right), and a paved\r\n    secondary road (on left) leave the valley to enter the canyons in\r\n    and above Canyonlands National Park. Rounded remnants on top are\r\n    Navajo Sandstone; cliffs are Kayenta Formation and Wingate\r\n    Sandstone; red slopes are Chinle and Moenkopi Formations, and\r\n    perhaps a little of the Cutler Formation at the base. Light-colored\r\n    patches at base of slope behind trees on left are contorted\r\n    intrusions of Paradox Member of Hermosa Formation. (Fig. 68).]\r\n\r\nThe Kings Bottom syncline (fig. 30) southwest of Moab Valley brings the\r\nNavajo Sandstone down to and slightly below water level, whereas at The\r\nPortal (fig. 68) the Navajo caps the southwest wall of Moab Valley.\r\nSeveral anticlines at or near the river from Potash to and beyond the\r\nconfluence (fig. 1) bring up strata as old as the Rico or the unnamed\r\nupper member of the Hermosa. Between these extremes, much of the river’s\r\ncourse lies in strata of the Cutler Formation.\r\n\r\nAbout 7 miles below The Portal, Highway 279 is joined on the right by a\r\nbranch line of the Denver and Rio Grand Western Railroad completed in\r\n1962 to haul potash 36 miles from the mine at Potash north to the main\r\nline at Crescent Junction. The railroad emerges from a tunnel at the\r\nhead of Bootlegger Canyon. Two natural arches near the mouth of the\r\ntunnel—Pinto and Little Rainbow Bridge—can be reached by trail. About 3\r\nmiles farther down the Colorado is a temporary dock from which jet boats\r\nand the _Canyon King_, a 93-foot 150-passenger stern-wheeler, take off\r\nfor points downriver during the spring and early summer, when water\r\ndepth permits. The _Canyon King_ (fig. 69), a small replica of a\r\nMississippi River stern-wheeler, carries passengers about 30 miles\r\ndownriver to the foot of Dead Horse Point and returns (Lansford, 1972).\r\n\r\nAbout 12 miles below The Portal we reach Potash—the potash “mine” (fig.\r\n70) of Texas Gulf, Inc. (See fig. 31 and its associated text for\r\ndescription of operation.) Travelers down the jeep trail below Potash\r\npass the evaporation ponds (fig. 71) used to separate the potash from\r\ncommon salt.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE _CANYON KING_, a 93-foot 150-passenger\r\n    stern-wheeler which hauls passengers some 30 miles below Potash and\r\n    returns.

(Fig. 71)]\r\n\r\nAcross the river east from Potash is Jackson Hole, a large rincon. Since\r\nabandonment, which shortened the river by about 3½ miles, the river has\r\ncut its channel nearly 200 feet deeper. It is comparable in size to the\r\nlarge rincon along Green River below Bowknot Bend (p. 90) but probably\r\nis somewhat younger. Both rincons may be as old as late Tertiary (fig.\r\n80). Just below Potash we cross the axis of the huge Cane Creek\r\nanticline (fig. 31) and also leave Grand County to enter San Juan\r\nCounty. A mile east of this point, high on the canyon wall, is the\r\nSchool Section 13 uranium mine, which has yielded considerable ore and\r\nis expected to resume production sometime during 1973. It can be seen\r\nfrom the river or the trail, and some of the tailings are visible on the\r\nleft flank of the anticline in figure 13.\r\n\r\nVoyagers who cross the axis of the Cane Creek anticline may observe on\r\nthe right-hand (west) bank a protruding oil-well casing, some drill\r\nbits, and several shacks—all that remain of the Frank Shafer No. 1 oil\r\ntest started during the winter of 1924-25 and completed by the Midwest\r\nExploration Co. (Baker, 1933, p. 81). As described by Maxine Newell\r\n(U.S. Natl. Park Service, written commun., 1970),\r\n\r\n  The well blew in in December 1925, caught fire, and spewed burning oil\r\n  300 feet into the air. * * * The local Times-Independent newspaper\r\n  called it “Mother Nature’s Christmas Gift to Grand County.” The gusher\r\n  burned down the rig, a barge of equipment, and it took three months to\r\n  get it under control. Then it didn’t produce.\r\n\r\nVarious 1925 and 1926 issues of the Moab Times-Independent reported that\r\ndespite many efforts to plug the well, it continued to flow from 1,000\r\nto several thousand barrels of oil per day for 6 months or more, all of\r\nwhich floated down the river. The last blowout occurred in 1937, after\r\nwhich the well was plugged with an additional 180 tons of cement.\r\n\r\nMrs. Newell added,\r\n\r\n  The stories told of the early-day exploration are endless and\r\n  delightful. Equipment and supplies were barged down the Colorado River\r\n  by the old Moab Garage Company; in winter months materials were\r\n  carried by team and sled over the river ice. They would take a couple\r\n  of rig timbers and pile a lot of lumber on them (they could take\r\n  10,000 feet), then we’d give them a start with a crowbar and the mules\r\n  would trot all the way downhill to the well. When they’d get there\r\n  they had a little trouble stopping sometimes; they would turn into the\r\n  bank, unload, then put the double trees on one mule, ride the other,\r\n  and head back for a new load of rig lumber.\r\n\r\nThe evaporation ponds shown in figures 31 and 71 are in Shafer Basin, a\r\nsynclinal basin separating the Cane Creek anticline and Shafer dome. We\r\ncross the axis of Shafer Basin about 2 miles below the county line.\r\n\r\nFurther downstream is Shafer dome, a closed anticlinal bulge just beyond\r\nthe W-shaped bend in the river as shown in figure 29. Parts of the dome\r\nalso show up in the lower right of figure 13 and the lower left of\r\nfigure 15. From almost anywhere in the Goose Neck, the sharp bend of the\r\nriver shown in figure 15, we get an excellent view of Dead Horse Point\r\nsome 2,000 feet above.\r\n\r\nRobert R. Norman (oral commun. Feb. 27, 1973) described to me a small\r\npetrified forest—which he said resembles a log jam—in the eastern part\r\nof the Shafer dome, at mileage 39 (Baars and Molenaar, 1971, p. 65),\r\njust north of this point about half way between the river and the jeep\r\ntrail below Dead Horse Point. He estimated that there probably are 20 to\r\n30 logs, some of which are as large as 18 inches in diameter and more\r\nthan 20 feet long, and also described a stump about 3 feet in diameter.\r\nThey occur in red beds at about the middle of the Rico Formation, hence\r\ncould be either Pennsylvanian or Permian in age (figs. 9, 80). The\r\noriginal wood has been replaced by silica (SiO₂) and stained a dark\r\nreddish brown, as shown in figure 72.\r\n\r\nMr. Norman and his brother also discovered many teeth of a primitive\r\nsharklike fish in the Rico Formation at the same general locality as the\r\npetrified wood and also in the Rico on the Cane Creek anticline. I\r\nsubmitted two of the teeth to Dr. David H. Dunkle, curator of the\r\nCleveland Museum of Natural History, who reported them to be “one tooth\r\nof the cochliodont ‘shark’ _Deltodus_, and one tooth of the petalodont\r\n‘shark’ _Petalodus_” (written commun., May 22, 1973).\r\n\r\nAbout 4 miles below the Goose Neck, we enter Canyonlands National Park\r\nand remain in the park almost to the north end of Lake Powell.\r\n\r\nAbout 6½ miles into the park, at the north end of a bend much like the\r\nGoose Neck, is the mouth of Lathrop Canyon, where many boaters stop for\r\nlunch and where a side road connects with the White Rim Trail (fig. 1).\r\n\r\nSix and one half miles below Lathrop Canyon is the mouth of Rustler\r\nCanyon, which is joined near its mouth by Indian Creek—the creek\r\nfollowed by the highway leading to The Needles from U.S. 163. Within an\r\nairline distance of only 3 miles, the lower reach of Indian Creek, an\r\nintermittent stream, flows past four small rincons, three of which (fig.\r\n73) are within an airline distance of only 0.8 mile. The stream has cut\r\nits new channel into the red sandstones and shales of the Cutler\r\nFormation only 15 to 20 feet deeper than the abandoned ones in the two\r\nrincons at the left in figure 73 and only about 25 feet deeper than the\r\none on the right. These figures suggest, at least to me, that these\r\ncutoffs probably occurred sometime during the Holocene Epoch, or age of\r\nman—that is, probably within the last 10,000 years (fig. 80). A detailed\r\nstudy of these rincons might change this estimate, particularly if, say,\r\nburied driftwood or other carbonaceous material could be found for an\r\nage determination by the radiocarbon method.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: PETRIFIED LOG, near middle of Rico Formation, about 1\r\n    mile southeast of Dead Horse Point.

Aerial photograph by U.S. Geological Survey.\r\n    (Fig. 74)]\r\n\r\nAbout 5 miles below the mouth of Rustler Canyon and Indian Creek, and\r\nalso about 5 miles above the confluence, is The Loop—an even sharper and\r\nmore symmetrical figure eight than Bowknot Bend of the Green River (fig.\r\n62). An aerial view of The Loop (fig. 74) shows that the channels on the\r\nsouth loop are only about 500 feet apart and that those on the north\r\nloop are only about 1,700 feet apart. At the narrowest places, both\r\nsaddles are considerably eroded—the southern one is only about 150 feet\r\nabove the river, but the northern one is still about 350 feet above.\r\nErosion of both saddles has been hastened by the facts that the axis of\r\nthe Meander anticline (see p. 108) passes through each saddle and that\r\nan interesting reverse fault (fig. 75) passes through the lower and\r\nthinner southern saddle. The differences between reverse and normal\r\nfaults are shown by comparing figures 56 and 76. It seems inevitable\r\nthat some day the small saddle will be cut through by the Colorado\r\nRiver, and a new rincon will result. Eventually, the other loop also\r\nprobably will be abandoned. As one of my colleagues remarked, how\r\nwonderful it would seem, to be present at the proper moment to witness\r\nsuch an event, particularly if one had a time-lapse movie camera to\r\nrecord it for posterity!\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: REVERSE FAULT in southern saddle of The Loop, looking\r\n    northwest from boat in river.

(Fig.\r\n    76)]\r\n\r\nAbout a mile and a half below the south saddle of The Loop we meet the\r\nmouth of Salt Creek, which drains a large part of the Needles district.\r\nFigure 77 was taken in Salt Creek canyon about 2 airline miles above the\r\nmouth looking southeast toward Six-Shooter Peaks and Shay Mountain,\r\nnorthernmost of the Abajo Mountains, on the horizon.\r\n\r\nA mile and a half above the confluence is The Slide, a jumbled mass of\r\nangular blocks of rock that fell from the northwest canyon wall and\r\noriginally probably extended all the way to the southeast bank of the\r\nriver. As shown in figure 78, it still extends nearly across the river,\r\nleaving only a narrow deep chute along the southeast bank. Just after\r\nthe photograph was taken, we hit rough fast water in the chute, with\r\nwaves about 2 feet high. At higher stages of the river, progressively\r\nmore of The Slide is covered by water, and there is less tendency for\r\nwaves to form. The date of this landslide is not known, but it is shown\r\non a map by Herron (1917, pl. 22A) made prior to 1917 and may well have\r\noccurred during prehistoric times.\r\n\r\nSoon we reach the confluence of the Green and Colorado Rivers (figs. 59,\r\n60). This important junction of two mighty rivers was noted by all\r\nprevious voyagers, but their impressions of it differed considerably.\r\nPowell (1875, p. 56) remarked:\r\n\r\n  These streams unite in solemn depths, more than one thousand two\r\n  hundred feet below the general surface of the country. The walls of\r\n  the lower end of Stillwater Cañon are very beautifully curved [see\r\n  fig. 67], as the river sweeps in its meandering course. The lower end\r\n  of the cañon through which the Grand comes down, is also regular, but\r\n  much more direct, and we look up this stream, and out into the country\r\n  beyond, and obtain glimpses of snow clad peaks, the summits of a group\r\n  of mountains known as the Sierra La Sal [La Sal Mountains]. Down the\r\n  Colorado, the cañon walls are much broken.\r\n\r\nDellenbaugh (1902, p. 277) gave a fuller description but concluded: “In\r\nevery way the Junction is a desolate place”—an appraisal with which I\r\ndisagree. The most colorful account I have read is that of Captain\r\nFrancis Marion Bishop, a member of Powell’s 1871 expedition, who\r\nrecorded in his journal for September 15, 1871 (1947, p. 202):\r\n\r\n  Well, we are at last, after many days of toil and labor, here at the\r\n  confluence of the two great arteries of this great mountain desert. No\r\n  more shall our frail boats dash through thy turbid waters, Old Green,\r\n  and no more shall we press on to see the dark flood from the peaks and\r\n  parks of Colorado. Grand and Green here sink to thy rest, and from thy\r\n  grave the _Colorado de Grande_ shall flow on forever, and on thy bosom\r\n  henceforth will we battle with rock and wave. One can hardly tell\r\n  which is the largest of the two rivers. Neither seems to flow into the\r\n  other, but there seems to be a blending of both, and from their union\r\n  rolls the Colorado River.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SALT CREEK CANYON, looking southeast from point on\r\n    rim 2 miles above mouth.

(Fig. 77)]\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: THE SLIDE, which partly blocks the Colorado River\r\n    about 1½ miles above the confluence. View downstream. (Fig. 78).]\r\n\r\nCataract Canyon heads at the confluence, but the rapids do not appear\r\nuntil we leave Spanish Bottom some 3½ miles below. Between The Loop and\r\nSpanish Bottom, the Colorado River follows closely the axis of an\r\nanticline. Along this reach the rock strata dip downward away from the\r\nriver, as shown in figure 61. This fold was noted by Powell and some of\r\nhis men, and Bishop (1947, p. 203) reported in his journal for September\r\n16, 1871:\r\n\r\n  He [Steward] is at a loss how to account for the folded appearance of\r\n  the strata here. But doubtless will find some explanation. Says the\r\n  dip recedes from the river cañon, and thinks it is a fissure. Maj.\r\n  [Powell] thinks it is owing to an upheaval, and that the beds next to\r\n  the river have broken up from the mass, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nForty-four years later Harrison (1927) named this structure the Meander\r\nanticline and concluded that the weight of the rocks on each side of the\r\nriver had squeezed underlying beds of salt in the Paradox Member of the\r\nHermosa Formation and caused them to move upward along the river, where\r\nthe confining strata had been removed by erosion. Harrison’s theory was\r\naccepted by Baker (1933) and most later workers in the area. Thus we\r\nhave what may be termed an erosional anticline, whose axis, or crest,\r\nfollows the river. Erosional anticlines also occur elsewhere, as along\r\nthe Eagle and Roaring Fork valleys of central Colorado. Mutschler and\r\nHite (1969) suggested that this zone of weakness in Canyonlands overlies\r\nand follows a break in the hard Precambrian (fig. 80) rocks that\r\nunderlie the area at great depth. At any rate, Powell was on the right\r\ntrack even though he was totally unaware of the underlying salt or the\r\ndeep-seated fault.\r\n\r\nSmooth water continues from the confluence to Spanish Bottom, where the\r\nOld Spanish Trail comes down to the river from the west and continues up\r\nLower Red Lake Canyon to the east. As mentioned earlier, this is about\r\nthe south end of the Meander anticline, and an intruded chunk of the\r\nParadox Member, mostly gypsum, occupies part of the mouth of Lower Red\r\nLake Canyon, as shown in figure 79.\r\n\r\nThe remaining 10 miles or so of Cataract Canyon within Canyonlands\r\nNational Park contains many rapids and should be traversed only under\r\nthe leadership of experienced river guides. If and when Lake Powell\r\nreaches its maximum level, it will extend to within about a mile of the\r\npark, but at present (1973) it heads near the mouth of Gypsum Canyon,\r\nabout 5 miles below the park.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: GYPSUM PLUG of Paradox Member, intruded along south\r\n    end of Meander anticline at mouth of Lower Red Lake Canyon.

The rock layers\r\nthemselves—like pages in a long and complicated History—record the\r\nsurface-shaping events of the past, and buried within them are traces of\r\nlife—the plants and animals that evolved from organic structures that\r\nexisted perhaps three billion years ago.\r\n\r\nAlso contained in rocks once molten are radioactive elements whose\r\nisotopes provide earth scientists with an atomic clock. Within these\r\nrocks, “parent” isotopes decay at a predictable rate to form “daughter”\r\nisotopes. By determining the relative amounts of parent and daughter\r\nisotopes, the age of these rocks can be calculated.\r\n\r\nThus the results of studies of rock layers (stratigraphy), and of the\r\nprogressive development of life (paleontology), coupled with the ages of\r\ncertain rocks as measured by atomic clocks (geochronology), attest to a\r\nvery old Earth!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Summary of Geologic History\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving finished our geologic ramble through Canyonlands National Park,\r\nlet us see how this pile of eroded rocks fit into the bigger scheme of\r\nthings—the geologic age and events of the earth as a whole, as depicted\r\nin figure 80. As shown in figure 9, the rock strata still preserved in\r\nthe park range in age from Pennsylvanian to Jurassic, or from about 300\r\nto 175 million years ago, a span of about 125 million years. This seems\r\nan incredibly long time, until you note that the earth is some 4.5\r\nbillion years old and that our rock pile is but one twenty-fifth, or 4\r\npercent, of the age of the earth as a whole. Thus, in figure 80 the\r\nrocks exposed in the park occupy only about the left-hand third of the\r\ntop whorl of the spiral.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the whole story. As indicated earlier, about 10,000 feet\r\nof younger Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks that once covered the area have\r\nbeen carried away by erosion, and if we include these, the span is\r\nincreased to about 250 million years, or nearly a full whorl of the\r\nspiral.\r\n\r\nDeep tests for oil and gas tell us that much older rocks underlie the\r\narea, and we have seen that some of these rocks played a part in shaping\r\nthe park we see today—note the breaks in the deep-seated Precambrian\r\nrocks and the salt in the Paradox Member. In addition to the Precambrian\r\nigneous and metamorphic rocks, there are about 2,000 feet of Paleozoic\r\nsedimentary rocks older than the Pennsylvanian Paradox Member. Most of\r\nthese sedimentary rocks were laid down in ancient seas during Cambrian,\r\nOrdovician, Devonian, Mississippian, and Pennsylvanian times (fig. 80).\r\nThere are some gaps in the rock record caused by temporary emergence of\r\nthe land above sea level and erosion of the land surface before the land\r\nagain subsided below sea level so that deposition could resume. Silurian\r\nrocks are absent altogether, presumably because here the Silurian Period\r\nwas dominated by erosion rather than deposition.\r\n\r\nWhile Pennsylvanian and Permian sediments were being deposited in and\r\nsouthwest of the park, a large area to the northeast—called by\r\ngeologists the Uncompahgre highland, because it occupied the same\r\ngeneral area as the present Uncompahgre Plateau—rose slowly above sea\r\nlevel. Whatever Paleozoic rocks there were on this rising land, plus\r\npart of the underlying Precambrian rocks, were eroded and carried by\r\nstreams into deep basins to the northeast and southwest. Thus, while\r\nmostly marine or nearshore deposits were being laid down in and near the\r\npark, thousands of feet of red beds were being laid down by streams in\r\nan area between the park and the Uncompahgre Plateau. During part of\r\nMiddle Pennsylvanian time a large area including the park and known as\r\nthe Paradox Basin was alternately connected to or cut off from the sea,\r\nso the water evaporated during cutoff periods and was replenished during\r\nperiods when connection with the sea resumed. In this huge evaporation\r\nbasin were deposited the layers of salt and gypsum plus some potash\r\nsalts and shale that now make up the Paradox Member.\r\n\r\nThe old Uncompahgre highland continued to shed debris into the bordering\r\nbasins until Triassic time, when it began to acquire a veneer of red\r\nsandstone and siltstone of the Chinle Formation (Lohman, 1965). The area\r\nremained above sea level during the Triassic Period and most if not all\r\nthe Jurassic Period, although the Jurassic Carmel Formation was laid\r\ndown in a sea that lay just to the west.\r\n\r\nLate in the Cretaceous Period a large part of central and southeastern\r\nUnited States, including the eastern half of Utah, sank beneath the sea,\r\nas shown in figure 81, and received thousands of feet of mud, silt, and\r\nsome sand that later compacted into the Mancos Shale. This formation and\r\nall the younger and some older strata have long since been eroded from\r\nthe park area but are present in adjacent areas, such as the lower\r\nslopes of the Book Cliffs north of Green River, Crescent Junction, and\r\nCisco (fig. 7).\r\n\r\nThe land rose above the sea at about the close of the Cretaceous and has\r\nremained above ever since, although inland basins and lakes received\r\nsediment during parts of the Tertiary Period. Compressive forces in the\r\nearth’s crust produced some gentle folding of the strata at the close of\r\nthe Cretaceous, but more pronounced folding and some faulting occurred\r\nduring the Eocene Epoch, when most of the Rocky Mountains took form.\r\nDuring the Miocene Epoch molten igneous rock welled up into the strata\r\nto form the cores of the nearby La Sal, Abajo, and Henry Mountains (fig.\r\n7). Additional uplift and some folding occurred in the Pliocene and\r\nPleistocene Epochs.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LATE CRETACEOUS SEA, which covered parts of central\r\n    and southeastern United States. (Fig. 81)]\r\n\r\nMuch of the course of the Colorado River was established in the Miocene\r\nEpoch, with some additional adjustments in the late Pliocene and early\r\nPleistocene Epochs (Hunt, 1969, p. 67). Erosion during much of the\r\nTertiary Period and all of the Quaternary Period, combined with some\r\nsagging and breaking of the crust brought on by solution and lateral\r\nsqueezing of salt beds beneath The Needles, The Grabens, and the Meander\r\nanticline, produced the landscape as we now see it.\r\n\r\nThe Precambrian rocks beneath the area are about 1.5 billion years old,\r\nso an enormous span of time is represented by the rocks and events in\r\nand beneath Canyonlands National Park.\r\n\r\nIf we consider the geologic formations that make up the Colorado\r\nPlateau—including national parks (N.P.), national monuments (N.M.)\r\n(excluding small historical or archeological ones), Monument Valley, San\r\nRafael Swell, and Glen Canyon National Recreation Area—certain\r\nformations or groups of formations play starring roles in some parks or\r\nmonuments, some play supporting roles, and in a few places the entire\r\ncast of rocks gets about equal billing. Let us compare them and see how\r\nand where they fit into the geologic time spiral (fig. 80).\r\n\r\nDinosaur N. M., with exposed rocks ranging in age from Precambrian to\r\nCretaceous, represents the greatest time span (nearly 2 billion years)\r\nbut has one unit—the Jurassic Morrison Formation—in the starring role,\r\nfor this unit contains the many dinosaur fossils that give the monument\r\nits name and fame; several older units have supporting roles. Grand\r\nCanyon N. P. and N. M. are next, with rocks from Precambrian through\r\nPermian (excluding the Quaternary lava flows in the N. M.), but here\r\nthere is truly a team effort, for the entire cast gets about equal\r\nbilling. Canyonlands N. P. stands third in size of cast, with rocks\r\nranging from Pennsylvanian to Jurassic, but we would have to give top\r\nbilling to the Permian Cedar Mesa Sandstone Member of the Cutler\r\nFormation, from which The Needles, The Grabens, and most of the arches\r\nwere sculptured; the Triassic Wingate Sandstone and Kayenta Formation\r\nget second billing for their roles in forming and preserving Island in\r\nthe Sky and other high mesas.\r\n\r\nNow let us consider those with only one or few players in the cast,\r\nbeginning at the bottom of the time spiral. Black Canyon of the Gunnison\r\nN. M., cut entirely in rocks of early Precambrian age (except for only a\r\nveneer of much younger rocks), obviously has but one star in its cast.\r\nColorado N. M. contains rocks ranging from Precambrian to\r\nCretaceous—equal to Dinosaur in this respect—but it is unique in that\r\nall the rocks of the long Paleozoic Era and some others are missing from\r\nthe cast; of those that remain, the Triassic Wingate and Kayenta are the\r\nstars, with strong support from the Jurassic Entrada Sandstone.\r\n\r\nAll the bridges in Natural Bridges N. M. were carved from the Permian\r\nCedar Mesa Sandstone, also the star in Canyonlands N. P. In Canyon de\r\nChelly (pronounced “dee shay”) N. M. and Monument Valley (neither N. P.\r\nnor N. M., as it is owned and administered by the Navajo Tribe), the de\r\nChelly Sandstone Member of the Cutler Formation—a Permian member younger\r\nthan the Cedar Mesa—plays the starring role.\r\n\r\nWupatki N. M., near Flagstaff, Ariz., stars the Triassic Moenkopi\r\nFormation. Petrified Forest N. P. (which now includes part of the\r\nPainted Desert) also has but one star—the Triassic Chinle Formation,\r\nwith its many petrified logs and stumps of ancient trees. The\r\nTriassic-Jurassic Glen Canyon Group (fig. 9), which includes the\r\nTriassic Wingate Sandstone and Kayenta Formation and the\r\nTriassic-Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, receives top billing in recently\r\nenlarged Capitol Reef N. P., but the Triassic Moenkopi and Chinle\r\nFormations enjoy supporting roles.\r\n\r\nThe Triassic-Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, erosional remnants of which are\r\nfound on the high mesas of Canyonlands N. P., is the undisputed star of\r\nZion N. P., Rainbow Bridge N. M., and Glen Canyon National Recreation\r\nArea, despite the fact that the latter is the type locality of the\r\nentire Glen Canyon Group (fig. 9). The Navajo also forms the impressive\r\nreef at the eastern edge of the beautiful San Rafael Swell (a dome, or\r\nclosed anticline, fig. 7), now crossed by Highway I-70 between Green\r\nRiver and Fremont Junction, Utah.\r\n\r\nAs we journey upward in the time spiral (fig. 80), we come to the\r\nJurassic Entrada Sandstone, which stars in Arches N. P., with help from\r\nthe underlying Navajo Sandstone and a supporting cast of both older and\r\nyounger rocks. The Entrada also forms the grotesque erosional forms\r\ncalled “hoodoos and goblins” in Goblin Valley State Park, north of\r\nHanksville, Utah.\r\n\r\nMoving ever upward in the spiral, we come to the Cretaceous—the age of\r\nthe starring Mesaverde Group, whose caves in Mesa Verde N. P. now house\r\nbeautifully preserved ruins once occupied by the Anasazi, the same\r\nancient people who once dwelt in Canyonlands N. P.\r\n\r\nThis brings us up to the Tertiary Period, during the early part of which\r\nthe pink limestones and shales of the Paleocene and Eocene Wasatch\r\nFormation were laid down in inland basins. Beautifully sculptured\r\ncliffs, pinnacles, and caves of the Wasatch star in Bryce Canyon N. P.\r\nand nearby Cedar Breaks N. M. This concludes our climb up the time\r\nspiral, except for Quaternary volcanoes and some older volcanic features\r\nat Sunset Crater N. M., near Flagstaff, Ariz.\r\n\r\nThus, one way or another, many geologic units that formed during the\r\nlast couple of billion years have performed on the stage of the Colorado\r\nPlateau and, hamlike, still lurk in the wings eagerly awaiting your\r\napplause to recall them to the footlights. Don’t let them down—visit and\r\nenjoy the national parks and monuments of the Plateau, for they probably\r\nare the greatest collection of scenic wonderlands in the world.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: Dinosaur]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional Reading\r\n\r\n\r\nMany reports covering various aspects of the area have been cited in the\r\ntext by author and year, and these plus a few additional ones are listed\r\nbelow under “Selected References.” A few of general or special interest\r\nshould be mentioned, however.\r\n\r\nBetween 1926 and 1931 virtually the entire area now included in the park\r\nwas mapped geologically in three classic reports—two by Baker (1933,\r\n1946) and one by McKnight (1940). These men and their field assistants\r\nmapped the area by use of the plane table and telescopic alidade without\r\nbenefit of modern topographic maps or aerial photographs, except for\r\ntopographic maps of narrow stretches along the Green and Colorado Rivers\r\nmade under the direction of Herron (1917). Only small sections could be\r\nreached by automobile, so nearly all the area was traversed using horses\r\nor by hiking.\r\n\r\nDuring the uranium boom of the early and middle 1950’s, the U.S.\r\nGeological Survey remapped the topography of most of the area at a scale\r\nof 1:24,000 and also remapped the geology of much of the area at this\r\nsame scale. The southern part of the Needles district was mapped by\r\nLewis and Campbell (1965). The geologic mapping west of the Green and\r\nColorado Rivers was done by F. A. McKeown, P. P. Orkild, C. C. Hawley,\r\nand others; that east of the Colorado River and a little between the two\r\nrivers was done by E. N. Hinrichs and others. Only four of the geologic\r\nmaps have been published (Hinrichs and others, 1967, 1968, 1971a, b),\r\nbut all this work and the older reports were used by Williams (1964) in\r\ncompiling the 1:250,000-scale geologic map of the Moab quadrangle, by\r\nWilliams and Hackman (1971) in compiling a similar map of the Salina\r\nquadrangle, and by Haynes, Vogel, and Wyant (1972) in compiling a\r\nsimilar map of the Cortez quadrangle. These three maps show the geology\r\nof the entire park.\r\n\r\nThe 1970 issue of the Naturalist in which the cited papers by Jennings,\r\nNewell, and Stokes appear also contains other papers on Canyonlands\r\nNational Park, including one on the plants.\r\n\r\nSeveral early reports on the Green and Colorado Rivers and their\r\npotential utilization contain a wealth of information and many fine\r\nphotographs—two reports on the Colorado River by La Rue (1916, 1925),\r\none on the Green River by Wooley (1930), and one on the upper Colorado\r\nRiver (above the confluence) by Follansbee (1929).\r\n\r\nFor those who wish to learn more about the science of geology, I suggest\r\nthe textbook by Gilluly, Waters, and Woodford (1968).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Acknowledgments\r\n\r\n\r\nMy deep appreciation goes to Bates Wilson, former superintendent of\r\nCanyonlands National Park, and to Joe Carithers, former assistant\r\nsuperintendent, for their splendid cooperation in supplying data and\r\ninformation and for making available four-wheel-drive vehicles. I also\r\nwish to thank Chuck Budge, former chief ranger; Dave May, assistant\r\nchief ranger; Joe Miller, former maintenance engineer; Bob Kerr, new\r\nsuperintendent; Maxine Newell, park historian and member of the staff at\r\nArches National Park; Jerry Banta, park ranger at Arches; and Dave\r\nMinor, district ranger for the Needles district, for their many favors.\r\n\r\nI am grateful to several colleagues and friends for the loan of\r\nphotographs, for geologic help and data, and for reviewing this report.\r\nI am also deeply grateful to my wife Ruth for accompanying me on all the\r\nfield work and for her help and encouragement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          Selected references\r\n\r\n\r\n  Baars, D.
