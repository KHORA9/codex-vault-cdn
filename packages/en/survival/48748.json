To succeed in obtaining the public ear, is as difficult\r\nas it is important. This success is perhaps most efficiently\r\npromoted, by listening with attention to every remark of criticism,\r\nwhether good-natured or severe;--by then adopting the counsels of\r\nwisdom, and leaning on the solid column of experience. If these\r\npapers should fail to acquire popularity, and, like many of their\r\npredecessors, sink into _undeserved_ oblivion; it shall not be from\r\nthe want of a disposition to please, but from the absence of higher\r\npowers. It is the peculiar province of genius to render prolific\r\nthe most sterile soil, to invest with interest the most intractable\r\ntopic, and to mould into the form of beauty the most unpromising\r\nmaterials. For this rare and brilliant endowment, no adequate\r\nsubstitute can be found.\r\n\r\nShould every public speaker, or public writer, be required to\r\nconfine themselves to what is absolutely original, or strictly\r\nrelevant to their subject; what would become of a vast majority\r\nof the tribe of authors, and ninety-nine out of a hundred of our\r\norators in Congress? Of a speech of three or five hours in length,\r\none effect may be confidently predicted; that those of the audience\r\nwho do not fall asleep, will be fatigued and justly irritated, by\r\nsuch an unwarrantable trespass on their time and patience. Our\r\nnational character is not yet completely formed; but some features\r\nof it are assuming a permanent shape. Among these, there is one,\r\nby no means calculated to elevate us in the estimation of the rest\r\nof the world. Instead of that simplicity and Spartan brevity, by\r\nwhich republicans should be distinguished, we habituate ourselves\r\nto the unnecessary use of a multitude of words. WE ARE GIANTS IN\r\nPROFESSION, BUT PIGMIES IN ACTION. It has been confidently asserted,\r\nthat the speeches of one of the members of our federal legislature,\r\nfrom Tennessee, have actually cost the United States more money,\r\nthan would defray the entire expense of completing the Delaware and\r\nChesapeake canal. Now that the Missouri discussion is terminated,\r\nhow _honourable_ to the nation, it is not my present purpose to\r\ninquire; it would be desirable to ascertain whether the vote of a\r\nsolitary member was changed, by the endless speeches which were\r\ndelivered on the subject. If not, I should presume it was a pretty\r\nclear point, that they cost the PEOPLE much more than they were\r\nworth; and that such a prodigal waste of the time and treasure of\r\nthe nation, is highly reprehensible. But instead of arraigning the\r\nconduct of others, and exposing their weakness and defects, it may\r\nperhaps be the part of prudence to spare our censure for errors to\r\nbe met with much nearer home. By giving publicity to the following\r\ncommunication, I trust I shall not trespass on the indulgence of\r\nmy readers; while at the same time I shall evince a spirit of no\r\nfictitious candour, by which I wish at all times to be actuated.\r\n\r\n  \"HARRISBURG, _March 20._\r\n\r\n  \"_To the Desultory Remarker._\r\n\r\n\"SIR--You will pardon the liberty which, as a perfect stranger,\r\nI take of addressing you. I have long cultivated a taste for\r\nliterature; not that which abounds in circulating libraries, but\r\nthat which is met with in those \"_founts of English undefiled_,\"\r\nthe classical poets and essayists of Great Britain. Of the latter,\r\nI have a decided preference for ADDISON; because his humour is as\r\ninnocent as it is exquisite; and because his sincere and fervid\r\npiety is diametrically opposed to every thing like monastic gloom\r\nand austerity. He was a benefactor to mankind during the course\r\nof his life; and left them his example in the hour of death--\"_See\r\nhow a Christian can die!_\" I have not trimmed the midnight lamp,\r\nin perusing the pages of sentimental and mischievous nonsense; but\r\nderive the highest gratification from those books which have long\r\nenjoyed the united suffrages of virtue. But to my purpose. You have\r\nembarked in an honourable undertaking, and one in which very few\r\nhave been successful. You should profit, not merely by the wisdom\r\nof those that have gone before you, but also by their mistakes. I\r\nhave read your two first numbers; and unless some improvement shall\r\ntake place, either in your matter or manner, you will never be a\r\nfavourite of mine.--There is too much unvaried gravity, and studied\r\nelaboration, in them.--When we take up a newspaper, or magazine,\r\nwe do not expect to meet with a sermon, however well disposed we\r\nmight be to welcome it on a proper occasion. Permit me to observe,\r\nthat a long, prosing, lifeless essay, _will never be read_; and, if\r\nfrequently met with, will create a distaste for the journal itself,\r\nin which it may appear. Being friendly to your success, you will\r\nindulge me in repeating, that should you fail to impart a greater\r\ndegree of vanity and interest, to your future numbers; if you do not\r\nmore frequently smooth the wrinkled brow of care, and assume the\r\naspect of cheerfulness, you will lose many of the female readers you\r\nhave at present, and among the rest,\r\n\r\n  \"Your humble servant,\r\n\r\n  \"STELLA.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a sensible, well written letter; and, if it would not be\r\nindecorous to express an opinion as to another feature of it, not\r\noverburthened with compliment. I am aware of the force and truth of\r\nsome of STELLA's observations; and will endeavour _occasionally_ to\r\nprofit by them. Though considerably advanced in the vale of years, I\r\nhope never to be insensible to the good opinion of that sex, which\r\ncan successfully prefer claims to excellence, in every department\r\nof virtue; and whose influence on the well-being of society, is so\r\nincalculably important. What if my temples be encircled with the\r\nfrosts of many winters, and the wings of my fancy be enfeebled,\r\nby that incurable malady, old age; I still shall be delighted to\r\nminister to the pleasure of those, whose approbation is worth\r\ndesiring--\r\n\r\n  The wise and the learned, the witty and the fair.\r\n\r\nAn outline of the female character has been thus happily and\r\naccurately sketched, by the pencil of a poet.--The last couplet is\r\ndescriptive of a trait in this character, which is as amiable as it\r\nis true.\r\n\r\n    Oh! Woman, in our hours of ease\r\n    Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,\r\n    And variable as the shade\r\n    By the light, quivering aspen made;\r\n    _When pain and anguish wring the brow,\r\n    A ministering angel thou_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nTHE VILLAGE TEACHER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my younger days, I passed a considerable time in the pleasant\r\nvillage of G----. The society was lively and agreeable; and, as\r\nit consisted chiefly of ladies, our usual place of meeting was at\r\nthe tea table and the evening circle. Literature, the news of the\r\nday, and our little amusements, furnished the principal subjects\r\nof conversation; and although the society was elegant and well\r\neducated, yet the frequency of our meetings often drove us, for\r\nvariety, to the intrigues and petty scandal of the neighbourhood.\r\nThe disposition for this kind of entertainment became at last so\r\nstrong, that we grew ashamed of it; and resolved one evening to\r\ncreate a \"Court of Scandal,\" by which all offences against the\r\ngood breeding and charity of speech should be tried, and whose\r\ndecisions we bound ourselves to obey. When I observe how strong is\r\nour propensity for scandal, and with what greediness evil-speaking\r\nis listened to, I cannot help wishing that there were such a\r\ntribunal in every one's bosom. Did it exist, or rather did we\r\nsuffer the voice which there speaks, to be heard; we should often\r\nbe humbled at its decisions. If we unmask our actions and our\r\nmotives, we shall find this propensity at the bottom of much of\r\nwhat is called--virtuous indignation. At one time, it assumes the\r\nmock appearance of charity; at another, it tries to hide itself in\r\nsallies of wit, or lurks beneath a half whispered insinuation, or\r\na kind doubt, or a malicious inquiry. Its seeds are deeply sown,\r\nand take still deeper root in the human breast; and it requires the\r\nstrictest self-examination, and the greatest candour, to avoid being\r\noverrun, if I may so express myself, with this nightshade.\r\n\r\nI know of nothing more despicable, than the little mincing scandal\r\nwhich buzzes about in our polite circles. Always on the wing, with\r\nhoney in its mouth, and poison and bitterness in its trail, it\r\nspreads the injurious aspersion, and the doubtful insinuation; and\r\nfastens them, like mildew, upon the fairest and purest characters.\r\nIt is a vice essentially grovelling, and low-minded, and which\r\ngrows upon us at unawares. It advances imperceptibly through all\r\nits various degrees; from idle curiosity to the deep and settled\r\nmalignity, which has no pleasure but in the weaknesses, the errors,\r\nand misfortunes, of those around it. Beware, reader! lest while\r\ngiving to my description a local habitation in the person of thy\r\nneighbours, thou indulgest the disposition thyself, and turnest my\r\ncounsel into food for thy propensity.--But I have wandered from\r\nmy original plan, which was, to give some account of our court of\r\nscandal, and of the decisions which it pronounced.\r\n\r\nThe first cause that came before it, was, a complaint from Julia\r\nManners against Miss Busy, who had circulated a report that Julia\r\nwas about to be married.\r\n\r\nMiss Busy lived opposite to Julia's father's; and generally took\r\nher morning and afternoon station at the parlour window. She one\r\nday espied from thence, a well dressed young man escorting Julia\r\nhome. Her curiosity was immediately excited; and she sallied out\r\nto the next neighbour's, to inquire who the stranger was, and to\r\nwonder if he was not a suitor. The answer, _It is like enough_, was\r\nsufficient. She continued her walk, discovered his name at the next\r\nplace where she inquired, and received some trivial confirmation\r\nof her conjecture at a third. From that time forward, she asked\r\nall whom she visited, or received, if they had seen Miss Manners'\r\nsuitor. Conjecture was built upon conjecture, till at last poor\r\nJulia was to be married and sent off in the space of a fortnight.\r\nAfter a patient hearing of an hour, the court decreed, that Miss\r\nBusy should be interdicted any of our circle for two weeks, and that\r\nher parlour windows should be kept closed for as many months.\r\n\r\nMiss Lively happening to mention at the tea table, one afternoon,\r\nthat Maria Harwood had jilted Captain Jones, was immediately called\r\nto an account. She blushed, and said it was common rumour, and that\r\nshe knew nothing but what she had heard. The court decided that\r\nthis circumstance would not excuse her, for that she thus lent the\r\nauthority of her name to an idle story which she confessed she had\r\nno reason to believe was true. It was declared, that the person who\r\nassisted in circulating what was mere rumour, shared in the guilt\r\nof the fabricator; and that as Miss Lively was Maria Harwood's\r\nparticular friend, she had in this instance doubly offended. Miss\r\nLively was therefore examined again as to her authority for what she\r\nhad said. After much inquiry and prevarication, it turned out, that\r\nher mother's chamber-maid had heard Mr. Harwood's cook say, that\r\nit would serve such a proud thing right, if Miss Maria would turn\r\nhim off. The court ordered the fair offender to be reprimanded. The\r\npunishment had the proper effect; and for six weeks she could not\r\nmention an article of doubtful intelligence, without being asked if\r\nit came from Mr. Harwood's cook.\r\n\r\nThe next cause which I recollect, was of rather a more intricate\r\nnature. Julia Manners and Emma Harwood were near neighbours, and\r\nlived on terms of close intimacy. Julia was unconcealing, generous,\r\nand frank; free in her expressions, and warm in all her feelings.\r\nEmma was amiable and correct, but jealous of her dignity; and rather\r\neager in listening to the opinions of others respecting her. Such\r\na disposition always finds some one ready to gratify it; and Emma\r\nheard much to excite her jealousy, and alarm her pride. A young\r\nlady, _a mutual friend_, wondered to Emma that she should be so\r\nintimate with Miss Manners, and was sure she did not know all that\r\nJulia said about her. _What?_ eagerly exclaimed Emma. \"She could not\r\nsay: it was told in confidence, and she did not like to hurt any\r\none's feelings.\" This only excited more curiosity, and Emma at last\r\nforced her half willing friend to confess, that Julia had called her\r\nproud and touchy; and said she did not like her half so well as she\r\ndid her sister. Miss Harwood felt much hurt; and behaved very coolly\r\nto her old friend for several weeks. Julia at last complained to the\r\ncourt, and the affair was investigated. We found out, upon examining\r\nthe witnesses, that Julia had only tacitly assented to these\r\nopinions, which had been expressed by the fair informer herself; and\r\nhad never suffered them to influence her conduct. Emma was thereupon\r\nordered to kiss her old companion, and make an acknowledgment before\r\nthe company of the injustice she had committed; and we unanimously\r\nagreed to banish their mutual friend from our circle.\r\n\r\nI had intended to give some further decisions of our court, in which\r\nthe gentlemen are particularly interested; but my good friends, the\r\nEditors, are already looking askance for the end of my paper. _In\r\npublica commoda peccem_--if I longer take up the room devoted to my\r\nworthy neighbours, the farmers.\r\n\r\nI shall only add, that we found our court of scandal so efficacious,\r\nthat it restored our conversation in a few weeks to its former tone,\r\nand entirely banished the spirit of which I have complained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOR THE RURAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\"THE STORY OF RUTH.\"\r\n\r\n     \"And, behold, Boaz came from Beth-lehem, and said unto the\r\n     reapers, The Lord be with you. And they answered him, The Lord\r\n     bless thee.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are moments in the life of every virtuous man, when the vices\r\nand the enormities by which he is surrounded, and above all, the\r\nglaring deficiencies which he is compelled to remark, even in those\r\n\"whom he hath delighted to honour,\" come back upon the mind with an\r\noverpowering force, and spread their disheartening influence over\r\nthe whole train of his reflections. At such moments, when we have\r\nturned with disgust from the corruptions of human nature, and have\r\nalmost been tempted to seek in \"some boundless contiguity of shade,\"\r\na retreat from their contaminating influence; it is peculiarly\r\ndelightful to recur to some scene of virtuous enjoyment, or to\r\ndisperse the gloom which has gathered around us by a reference\r\nto the simplicity of other times. While dwelling upon the records\r\nof ancient purity, we become conscious of a joyous complacency;\r\nthe mind is elated in the contemplation of its own capability of\r\nhappiness, and reposes with delight upon the recollection of those\r\npeaceful pleasures, which can only exist among a virtuous people.\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no narrative to be found among the works of\r\nancient or modern authors, upon which the man who has become\r\nweary of the follies of the world, can dwell with more soothing\r\nsensations, than upon the story of Ruth. It is not to the\r\nunrivalled beauty of its style, nor to the pathetic eloquence\r\nwhich it contains, nor to the affecting nature of its incidents,\r\nthat it is indebted for its principal attractions. But it is in\r\nthe delineations of the peculiar practices of a people, who, as\r\nyet, had not forgotten the characteristic simplicity of their\r\nfathers; and in the striking allusions to their habits of social\r\nintercourse, that we feel ourselves most deeply interested. Many\r\nhave delighted to paint the pleasures of rural life in all their\r\nmost glowing colours; they have dilated upon its real and its\r\nfancied enjoyments; and have laboured to represent it as divested\r\nof all that shall darken the lustre of native purity, or detract\r\nfrom the reverence of virtue. But it may well be doubted whether\r\nthey have ever presented us with so engaging, and yet so perfectly\r\nnatural a picture, as that which is to be found in the simple and\r\nunlaboured narrative of inspiration. In the very salutations between\r\nBoaz and his reapers, we seem to have an evidence of that happy\r\nequality, and that habitual piety, which are alike the concomitants\r\nof untainted simplicity, and the victims of luxury and corruption.\r\n\"The Lord be with you,\" was the address of \"a mighty man of wealth\"\r\nto his reapers; \"and they answered him, The Lord bless thee.\" These\r\nare doubtless to be considered as the accustomed salutations of\r\nthe people; and they may frequently have carried with them nothing\r\nmore than the idea of mere ceremony. But they were salutations\r\nwhich must have originated among a religious people; and it was a\r\nceremony which must have been associated with all that is helpless\r\nand dependant in man, and all that is merciful and omnipotent in his\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\n  C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of our readers will probably recollect the amiable and\r\nenterprising ELIZABETH FRY, who has been for some time past, like\r\nthe celebrated Howard, engaged in visiting the prisons of England.\r\nThe peculiarity of the undertaking, for a female, and her unexpected\r\nsuccess in drawing the attention of the wretched objects of her\r\ncare, to something like their native dignity, have excited much\r\ninterest in the public mind. A copy of the following letter, giving\r\nsome account of her proceedings in Glasgow, was handed to us, with\r\nthe privilege of publishing it.--ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Communicated for the Rural Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Letter to Mrs. Fletcher, from a\r\n  friend in Glasgow._\r\n\r\nMrs. Fry's manner and voice are delightful; her communications,\r\nfree and unembarrassed.--She met, by appointment, several of the\r\nmagistrates, Mr. Erving, and a number of ladies, at Bridewell. She\r\ntold them, with much simplicity, what had been done at Newgate; and\r\nproposed something similar, if practicable, in Glasgow.\r\n\r\nShe entered into very pleasant conversation with every one. All were\r\ndelighted when she offered to speak a little to the poor women:\r\nbut the Keeper of Bridewell said he feared it was a dangerous\r\nexperiment; for that they never, but by compulsion, listened to\r\nreading, and were generally disposed to turn all into ridicule. She\r\nsaid she was not without fear of this happening; but she thought\r\nit would give pleasure to some, and would serve to show the ladies\r\nwhat she meant. The women, about a hundred, were then assembled in\r\na large room; and when she went in, seemed astonished, misdoubting,\r\nand lowering. She took off her little bonnet, and sat down on a\r\nlow seat, fronting the women; and looking round with a kind and\r\nconciliating manner, but with an eye that met every one, she\r\nsaid--\"I had better just tell you what we are come about.\" She said\r\n\"she had had to do with a great many poor women, sadly wicked; more\r\nwicked than any now present, and how they had recovered from evil.\"\r\n\r\nHer language was often Biblical, always referring to our Saviour's\r\npromises, and cheering with holy hope those desolate beings. \"Would\r\nyou like to turn from that which is wrong? Would you like if ladies\r\nwould visit you, and speak comfort to you, and help you to be\r\nbetter? Would you tell them your griefs? for they who have done\r\nwrong have many sorrows.\"\r\n\r\nAs she read them the rules, asking them always if they approved,\r\nthey were to hold up their hands if they acceeded. At first we saw\r\nthem down, and many hands were unraised; but as she spoke, tears\r\nbegan to fall. One beautiful girl near me, had her eyes swimming\r\nin tears; and her lips moved as if following Mrs. Fry's. An older\r\nwoman, who had her Bible, we saw pressing upon it involuntarily,\r\nas she became more and more engrossed. The hands were now almost\r\nall ready to rise at every pause; and these callous and obdurate\r\noffenders were, with one consent, bowed before her. At this moment,\r\nshe took the Bible, and read the parables of the _lost sheep_, and\r\nthe _pieces of silver_, and the _prodigal son_.--It is not in my\r\npower to express the effect of her saintly voice, speaking such\r\nblessed words. She often paused, and looked at the \"poor women,\" as\r\nshe named them, with such sweetness, as won all their confidence,\r\nand she applied with a beauty and taste such as I had never before\r\nwitnessed, the parts of the story--_His father saw him when he was\r\nafar off_, &c.--A solemn pause succeeded the reading. Then, resting\r\nthe large Bible on the ground, we saw her on her knees before the\r\nwomen. Her prayer was soothing and elevating; and her musical voice,\r\nin the peculiar recitative tone of her sect. I felt it like a\r\nmother's song to a suffering child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunicated for the Rural Magazine.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BRANDYWINE, _2d mo. 3, 1820._\r\n\r\n  REUBEN HAINES,\r\n\r\n_Esteemed friend_--I avail myself of a leisure hour to communicate\r\nmy opinion on the subject on which we had some conversation when\r\nthou wast at my house. I allude to the importance of a more general\r\nuse of mill feed for cattle in the neighbourhood of cities and\r\ntowns, where hay almost always commands a high price.\r\n\r\nWe will, in the first place, view the subject at the cost of the\r\nrespective articles in your market at this time.--Shorts can now be\r\nhad at 30 cents per double bushel, weighing about 35 lbs.\r\n\r\n  100 bushels of shorts, weighing 3500 lbs. neat,\r\n  will cost                                           D.30 00\r\n\r\n  3500 wt. of hay, at 25 dolls. per ton, will cost      39 12\r\n                                                       ______\r\n\r\n                           Difference,                D. 9 12\r\n\r\nHere there is a difference of $9, 12 cents, in favour of shorts,\r\nin a given weight of each; but I am quite confident, in my own\r\nopinion, that, taking an equal weight of each, there is _double the\r\nsustenance_ in the shorts; and if this opinion be correct, it shows\r\nthe following important result:\r\n\r\n  7000 lbs. of hay, at 25 dls. per ton, would cost    D.78 25\r\n\r\n  While 3500 lbs. of shorts, in which there is\r\n  equal if not greater nutriment, would cost only       30 00\r\n                                                       ______\r\n\r\n              Gain in favour of shorts,               D.48 25\r\n\r\nBut it appears to me there is another important saving would result\r\nto the farmer, from the introduction of mill feed. It would enable\r\nhim to keep his stock of horses at a great deal less expense than he\r\nnow keeps them. They would be more healthy, and _all his hay_ might\r\nbe saved for the horned cattle. By a very slight mixture of shorts\r\nwith cut straw, or cut corn-stalks, it would make very palatable\r\nfood; and the result in this method, compared with foddering on hay,\r\nwould be as follows.\r\n\r\nOne hundred bushels of shorts would be ample to mix with two tons of\r\nstraw, and two tons of stalks.\r\n\r\n  The shorts, as heretofore stated, would cost        D.30 00\r\n  2 tons of wheat, barley, or oat straw, at 5 dolls.\r\n  per ton,                                              10 00\r\n\r\n  The corn-stalks are now generally put in the\r\n  barn-yard: allow what paid for hauling\r\n  them, say D.2 50 per ton,                              5 00\r\n\r\n  Allow also for trouble in cutting the straw and\r\n  stalks,                                               10 00\r\n                                                       ______\r\n\r\n                                                        55 00\r\n\r\n_The Weight of the foregoing as follows_, viz.\r\n\r\n  The shorts,        3500 lbs.\r\n\r\n  2 tons of straw,   4480\r\n\r\n  2 tons of stalks,  4480\r\n                   ______\r\n\r\n                   12,460 lbs.\r\n\r\n  An equal weight of hay, at the present price,\r\n  25 dolls. would cost                                 139 25\r\n                                                       ______\r\n\r\n                           Difference,                D.84 25\r\n\r\nThou wilt readily perceive, without my dwelling on it, that the\r\nabove method would answer equally well for store cattle as for\r\nhorses. By the present mode the corn stalks are almost wholly\r\nlost, and a great proportion of the straw trodden under foot in\r\nthe barn-yards. One benefit that would result from the change of\r\nfeeding, and which must be obvious to every one, would be its\r\nenabling every farmer to keep a larger stock; and thus _increase his\r\nmanure_,--the grand secret, after all is said, in farming well, and\r\ndoing it to advantage.\r\n\r\nIf it is alleged that my calculation of hay is too high, it may be\r\nobserved, that the shorts are also estimated at a price higher than\r\nthey often command in the Philadelphia market. I have known them as\r\nlow as 20 cents; and 25 cents is a very common price in the fall of\r\nthe year. They may safely be put in bulk in the 11th mo. and will\r\nkeep sweet until the ensuing spring.--I have thus hastily thrown my\r\nideas together on this subject. If thou canst glean from them any\r\nthing of importance, I shall be glad.\r\n\r\nThy assured friend,\r\n\r\nJAMES CANBY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Treatise on Agriculture_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. II.\r\n\r\nOf the actual state of Agriculture in Europe.\r\n\r\n12. The climate and soil of _Great Britain_ and _Ireland_, are\r\nparticularly favourable to husbandry; nor is her geographical\r\nposition less auspicious--placed, as she is, on the longest line,\r\nand amidst the most important markets of the continent of Europe.\r\nIf to these advantages be added the laborious, enlightened, and\r\nenterprising character of the nation, we cannot but expect results\r\nthe most favourable to agriculture: yet is the fact notoriously\r\notherwise. To show that this opinion is neither hasty nor unfounded,\r\nwe must enter into details, which may not be unprofitable.\r\n\r\nThe surface of England is estimated at 37,265,853 acres, which are\r\ndistributed as follows:\r\n\r\n  In pasturage,                  18,796,458\r\n\r\n  In tillage,                    11,350,501\r\n\r\n  In cities, roads & canals,      3,454,740\r\n\r\n  Lands fit for pasturage\r\n  or tillage not cultivated,      3,515,238\r\n\r\n  Lands unfit for cultivation,    2,148,921\r\n\r\nOf the arable land the following annual disposition is made:\r\n\r\n  Lands unfit for cultivation,    2,148,921\r\n\r\n  In wheat and rye,               2,000,000\r\n\r\n  In peas, beans, and buckwheat,  2,000,000\r\n\r\n  In barley and oats,             4,000,000\r\n\r\n  In fallow, or in turnips or\r\n  cabbages,                       3,400,000\r\n\r\nThe lands, in wheat and rye, yield on an average of ten years,\r\n_three quarters_ per acre, or 6,000,000 quarters; yet there is an\r\nannual deficit in England of 1,820,000 quarters, which must be drawn\r\nfrom foreign markets.[1]\r\n\r\n  [1] A _quarter_ is equal to six bushels, and the average produce\r\n  in wheat and rye 18 bushels per acre. For the whole kingdom the\r\n  deficit is 2,820,000 quarters. See Geographic Mathematic, art. Great\r\n  Britain.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly nothing very flattering in this view of\r\nEnglish agriculture; but it may be said to be one of statists and\r\npoliticians, and probably underrated. Let us then see what their own\r\nmost eminent agriculturists, their Young and Sinclair, and Dickson\r\nand Marshall, say on this subject--\"_A very small portion of the\r\ncultivated parts of Great Britain, is to this day, submitted to a\r\njudicious and well conducted system of husbandry; not in fact more\r\nthan four counties_, (Norfolk, Sussex, Essex, and Kent:) _while\r\nmany large tracts of excellent soil are managed in a way the most\r\nimperfect and disadvantageous_.\"[2]\r\n\r\n  [2] See the introduction to Dickson's Practical Agriculture, 2d vol.\r\n  quarto.\r\n\r\nNor is her management of cattle better. \"Considering the domestic\r\nanimals in a general way, we find each species, and almost every\r\nrace, capable of great improvement, and, with a few exceptions, the\r\nsheep much neglected. In some districts are whole races of cattle\r\nincapable of improvement (within a reasonable time) in the three\r\ngreat objects which they are expected to yield, viz. milk, flesh,\r\nand labour.\"[3] We now add _some_ of the causes to which this\r\ndefective husbandry has been ascribed: \"to enumerate all would be\r\nimpossible, from their number and complication.\"[4]\r\n\r\n  [3] Marshal, vol. iv. p. 575.\r\n\r\n  [4] Dickson's Practical Agriculture.\r\n\r\n\"1st. The _commons_, or unenclosed grounds, which in many places\r\namount to near one half of the whole arable land, and which are\r\nsubmitted to the most absurd and ruinous system of culture.\"[5]\r\n\r\n  [5] Idem.\r\n\r\n\"2d. The _terms_ (amounting to personal servitude) under which many\r\nof the lands are held.\"\r\n\r\n\"3d. The _shortness of leases_ given by corporations (civil and\r\nreligious) and by individuals, and which seldom exceed _three_,\r\n_five_, or _seven_ years, excepting in the counties of Norfolk,\r\nSussex, Essex, and Kent, where (with great advantage to both\r\nlandlord and tenant) they are frequently extended to twenty-one\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\n\"4th. The _tithes in kind_, paid by the farmers to the church; a tax\r\nhighly vexatious in its character, and oppressive in its effects: and\r\n\r\n\"5th. The _poor tax_, which has become enormous, and of which the\r\nyeomanry pay three fourths. Of this tax it has been truly said, that\r\nit is a powerful instrument of depopulation--a barbarous contrivance\r\nfor checking all national industry.\"[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] Young's Tour through Ireland, vol. ii. p. 302.\r\n\r\nTo these causes, assigned by British writers, may be added the\r\n_increase_ of _population_, common to every nation of Europe, and\r\nwhich in Great Britain is beyond all proportion greater than the\r\nprogress of agriculture; the _augmentation_ of _cattle_, which\r\noccasions that of pasturage, and the diminution of tillage;[7] the\r\n_establishment_ of _great farms_ at the expense of _small_ ones, and\r\nthe _multiplication_ of _parks_ and _pleasure grounds_; and lastly,\r\nthe _attraction of great cities_, and the _continual drafts_ made\r\nupon the agricultural population, for the army and navy, and for\r\ncommerce and manufactures.\r\n\r\n  [7] Mr. Hume quotes with approbation an author, who complains of\r\n  the decay of tillage in the reign of Elizabeth, and who ascribes\r\n  it to the increase of pasturage, in consequence of the restraints\r\n  imposed on the exportation of grain, while that of butter, cheese,\r\n  &c. was free. The history of Europe, if read with an eye to public\r\n  economy, furnishes an abundant proof, that the greatest obstructions\r\n  to agriculture have arisen from the interference of government. We\r\n  have here no sly allusion to our own projects of a state board of\r\n  agriculture, of a chymico agricultural professorship, nor even of\r\n  an agricultural college, if the treasury in its wealth, and the\r\n  legislature in its wisdom, should deem such institutions useful or\r\n  necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECT. III.\r\n\r\nTheory of Vegetation.\r\n\r\nVegetables may be regarded as the intermediate link in the great\r\nchain of creation, between animals and minerals. The latter grow by\r\nmere chymical affinity, and by additions, sometimes analogous and\r\nsometimes foreign from their own nature; while plants, like animals,\r\nhave an organization that enables them to receive their food, digest\r\nand assimilate it to their own substance, reproduce their species,\r\nand maintain an existence of longer or shorter duration. Thus far\r\nthe learned are agreed, but at the next step they differ.\r\n\r\nWhat is this food that gives to plants their developement, and\r\nmaturity, and powers of reproduction? Lord Bacon believed that\r\n_water_ was the source of vegetable life, and that the earth was\r\nmerely its home, its habitation, serving to keep plants upright,\r\nand to guard them against the extremes of heat and cold. Tull, on\r\nthe other hand, (and after him Du Hamel) pronounced _pulverized\r\nearth_ the only pabulum of plants, and on this opinion built his\r\nsystem of husbandry. Van Helmont and Boyle opposed this doctrine\r\nby experiments: the former planted and reared a cutting of willow\r\nin a bed of dry earth, carefully weighed and protected against\r\naccretion by a tin plate, so perforated as to admit only rain and\r\ndistilled water, with which it was occasionally moistened. At\r\nthe end of five years the plant was found to have increased _one\r\nhundred and sixty-four pounds_, and the bed of earth to have lost,\r\nof its original weight, only _two ounces_. Boyle pursued a similar\r\nprocess with gourds, and with a similar result. Notwithstanding\r\nthe apparent conclusiveness of these experiments, their authority\r\nwas shaken, if not subverted, by others made by Margraff, Bergman,\r\nHales, Kirwan, &c. &c. The first of these showed, that the rain\r\nwater employed by Van Helmont, was itself charged with saline\r\nand other earthy matter; Bergman demonstrated this by analysis,\r\nwhile Kirwan and Hales proved that the earth in which the willow\r\ncutting was planted, could absorb these matters through the pores\r\nof the wooden box which contained it, and that a glass case could\r\nalone have prevented such absorption. Hunter, finding that oil and\r\nsalt entered into the composition of plants, concluded that these\r\nformed their principal food, and accordingly recommended, as the\r\ngreat desideratum in agriculture, an _oil compost_. Lord Kaimes\r\nattempted to revive the expiring creed of Lord Bacon, but finding\r\nfrom Hales' statics, that one third of the weight of a green pea was\r\nmade up of carbonic acid, he added _air_ to the watery aliment of\r\nthe English philosopher--but entirely rejected _oil_ and _earth_,\r\nas too gross to enter the mouths of plants, and _salt_ as too acrid\r\nto afford them nourishment. Quackery, which at one time or other,\r\nhas made its way into all arts and sciences, could not easily be\r\nexcluded from agriculture. Hence it was, that the Abbe de Valemont's\r\n_prolific liquor_, and De Hare's and De Vallier's _powders_, &c.\r\n&c. were believed to be all that was necessary to vegetation, and\r\nfound the more advocates, as they promised much and cost little.\r\nBut before the march of modern chymistry, quackery could not long\r\nmaintain itself; and from the labours of Bennet, Priestly, Saussure,\r\nIngenhouz, Sennebier, Schæder, Chaptal, Davy, &c. &c. few doubts\r\nremain on this important subject.--These will be presented in the\r\ncourse of the following inquiry.\r\n\r\n1st. Of _earths_, and their relation to vegetation.\r\n\r\nOf six or eight substances, which chymists have denominated\r\n_earths_, four are widely and abundantly diffused, and form the\r\ncrust of our globe. These are _silica_, _alumina_, _lime_, and\r\n_magnesia_.--The first is the basis of quartz, sand and gravel;\r\nthe second, of clay; the third, of bones, river and marine shells,\r\nalabaster, marble, limestone and chalk; and the fourth, of that\r\nmedicinal article known by the name of calcined magnesia.--In a\r\npure or isolated state,[8] these earths are wholly unproductive;\r\nbut when decomposed and mixed,[9] and to this mixture is added\r\nthe residuum of dead animal or vegetable matter,[10] they become\r\nfertile, take the general name of _soils_, and are again specially\r\ndenominated, after the earth that most abounds in their compositions\r\nrespectively. If this be silica, they are called _sandy_; if\r\nalumina, _argillaceous_; if lime, _calcareous_; and if magnesia,\r\n_magnesian_. Their properties are well known: a _sandy_ soil is\r\nloose, easily moved, little retentive of moisture, and subject\r\nto extreme dryness; an _argillaceous_ soil is hard and compact\r\nwhen dry, tough and paste-like when wet, greedy and tenacious of\r\nmoisture; turns up, when ploughed, into massive clods, and admits\r\nthe entrance of roots with great difficulty. A _calcareous_ soil is\r\ndry, friable and porous; water enters and leaves it with facility;\r\nroots penetrate it without difficulty, and (being already greatly\r\ndivided) less labour is necessary for it than for clay. _Magnesian_,\r\nlike calcareous earth, is light, porous and friable; but, like clay\r\nwhen wet, takes the consistency of paste, and is very tenaceous of\r\nwater. It refuses to combine with oxygen, or with the alkalies; is\r\ngenerally found associated with granite, gneiss, and schiste, and is\r\nprobably among the causes of their comparative barrenness.[11]\r\n\r\n  [8] See Gisbert's experiments on _pure earths_ and _their mixtures_.\r\n  See also Davy's Elements of Agricultural Chemistry, p. 156.\r\n\r\n  [9] In this respect nature has been neither negligent or niggardly,\r\n  if (as Fourcroy asserts) the purest sand be a mixture of quartz,\r\n  alumina, and sometimes of calcareous matter. _Speculative geology_\r\n  is romance, and does not merit the name of science; yet is science\r\n  obliged to borrow her theory of soils. The alternation of heat\r\n  and cold, moisture and dryness, decomposed the mountains of\r\n  primitive, secondary and tertiary formation; rains, and the laws\r\n  of gravity, brought these from places of more, to places of less\r\n  elevation--where, by mechanical mixture and chymical combination,\r\n  the present substrata were formed. But these were yet naked and\r\n  unproductive, when the Cryptogamia family (mopes and lichens) took\r\n  possession of them, and in _due time_ produced that vegetable\r\n  matter, which made the earth productive and the globe habitable!\r\n\r\n  [10] Dead animal and vegetable matter, in the last stage of\r\n  decomposition, give a black or brown powder, which the French\r\n  chymists call _terreau_ or _humus_, and which Mr. Davy calls an\r\n  _extractive matter_; _this_ is the fertilizing principle of soils\r\n  and manures.\r\n\r\n  [11] The opinion is general among the chymists of Europe, that\r\n  magnesian earth is not only barren itself, but the cause of\r\n  barrenness in other soils in which it may abound, unless saturated\r\n  with carbonic acid. See Base, Tennant, and Davy.\r\n\r\nIn these qualities are found the _mechanical relations_ between\r\nearths and vegetables. To the divisibility of the former it is\r\nowing, that the latter are enabled to push their roots into the\r\nearth; to their _density_, that plants maintain themselves in an\r\nerect posture, rise into the air, and resist the action of the\r\nwinds and rains; and to their _power_ of _absorbing_ and _holding_\r\nwater, the advantage of a prolonged application of moisture,\r\nnecessary or useful to vegetable life. But besides performing these\r\nimportant offices, there is reason to believe that they contribute\r\nto the _food_ of vegetables. This opinion rests on the following\r\nconsiderations and experiments:\r\n\r\n1. If earths do not contribute directly to the food of plants, then\r\nwould be all soils alike productive; or in other words, if air and\r\nwater _exclusively_ supply this food, then would a soil of pure sand\r\nbe as productive as one of the richest alluvion.\r\n\r\n2. Though plants may be made to grow in pounded glass, or in\r\nmetallic oxides, yet is the growth, in these, neither healthy nor\r\nvigorous; and,\r\n\r\n3. All plants, on analysis, yield an earthy product;[12] and this\r\nproduct is found to partake most of the earth that predominates in\r\nthe soil producing the analyzed plant; if _silica_ be the dominant\r\nearth, then is the product obtained from the plant _silicious_;\r\nif _lime_ prevail, then is the product _calcareous_, &c. &c. This\r\nimportant fact is proved by De Saussure.\r\n\r\n  [12] Davy says this never exceeds one fiftieth of the whole product.\r\n\r\n\r\n_1st Experiment._\r\n\r\nTwo plants (the pinus abies) were selected, the one from a\r\ncalcareous, the other from a granitic soil, the ashes of which gave\r\nthe following products;\r\n\r\n                          Granitic    Calcareous\r\n                            soil.        soil.\r\n\r\n  Potash                    3 60           15\r\n\r\n  Alk. and mu. sul          4 24           15\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of lime        46 34           63\r\n\r\n  Carbonate of magnesia     6 77           00\r\n\r\n  Silica                   13 49           00\r\n\r\n  Alumina                  14 86           16\r\n\r\n  Metallic oxides          10 52           00\r\n\r\n\r\n_2d Experiment._\r\n\r\nTwo Rhododendrons were taken, one from the calcareous soil of Mount\r\nde la Salle, the other from the granitic soils of Mount Bevern. Of\r\na _hundred_ parts, the former gave fifty-seven of carbonate of lime\r\nand five of silica; the latter, thirty of carbonate of lime, and\r\nfourteen of silica.\r\n\r\n\r\n_3d Experiment._\r\n\r\nThis was made to determine whether vegetables, the product of a soil\r\nhaving in it no silica, would, notwithstanding, partake of that\r\nearth.--Plants were accordingly taken from Reculey de Thoiry, (a\r\nsoil altogether calcareous) and the result was a very small portion\r\nof silica.\r\n\r\nThese experiments, says Chaptal, leave little if any doubt, but that\r\nvegetables derive the earthy matter they contain from the soil in\r\nwhich they grow.[13]\r\n\r\n  [13] Shæder maintains the doctrine, that the earths found in\r\n  plants are created there by the process of vegetation. His essay\r\n  on this subject was crowned by the academy of Berlin, in 1801. His\r\n  experiments were the first to determine the different quantities of\r\n  silica found in different kinds of grain.\r\n\r\n2. Of _water_, as an agent in vegetation.\r\n\r\nSeeds placed in the earth, and in a temperature above the freezing\r\npoint, and _watered_, will develope; that is, their lobes[14] will\r\nswell, their roots descend into the earth, and their stems rise into\r\nthe air. But without humidity, they will not germinate; or deprived\r\nof humidity after germinating, they will perish. When germination\r\nis complete, and the plant formed, its roots and leaves are so\r\norganized as to _absorb water_. The experiments of Hales prove,\r\nthat the weight of plants is increased in wet and diminished in dry\r\nweather; and that in the latter, they draw from the atmosphere (by\r\nmeans of their leaves)[15] the moisture necessary to their well\r\nbeing.--Du Hamel (and after him Sennebier) has shown, that the\r\nfilaments that surround the roots of plants, and which has been\r\ncalled their hair, perform for them in the _earth_, the office that\r\nleaves perform in the atmosphere, and that if deprived of these\r\nfilaments the plants die.\r\n\r\n  [14] Moisten a bean in warm water, and detach the skin that covers\r\n  it, and it readily divides into two parts; these are called _lobes_.\r\n\r\n  [15] Bonnet's experiments show, that it is the under surface of the\r\n  leaf that performs this function, The upper surface has a different\r\n  office.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy, but useless, to multiply facts of this kind\r\ntending to establish a doctrine not contested, but which after\r\nall does not assert, that water makes part of the food of plants.\r\nOn this point two opinions exist--the one, that this liquid is a\r\nsolvent and conductor of alimentary juices: the other, that is\r\nitself an aliment and purveyor of vegetable food at the same time.\r\nThe first opinion is abundantly established. Water when charged\r\nwith oxygen, supplies to germinating seeds the want of atmospheric\r\nair, and saturated with animal or vegetable matter in a state of\r\ndecomposition, or slightly impregnated with carbonic acid, very\r\nperceptibly quickens and invigorates vegetation. The second opinion\r\nis favoured by some of De Saussure's experiments. On these, Chaptal\r\nmakes the following remark, which expresses very distinctly an\r\napprobation of the doctrine they suggest:--\"The enormous quantity of\r\nhydrogen (which makes so large a part of vegetable matter) cannot\r\nbe accounted for but by admitting (in the process of vegetation)\r\nthe _decomposition_ of _water_, of which hydrogen is the principal\r\nconstituent; and that though there is nothing in the present state\r\nof our experience that directly establishes this doctrine, yet that\r\nits truth ought to be presumed, from the analysis of plants and the\r\nnecessary and well-known action of water on vegetation.\r\n\r\n  (To be continued.)\r\n\r\n_Correction._--In copying the second section, page 55, an error\r\nescaped in relation to the _Tuscan_ plough; the passage should have\r\nread thus--\"The plough of the north of Europe, like that of this\r\ncountry, has the power of a wedge, and acts horizontally--that that\r\nof Tuscany has the same direction, but very different form. With the\r\noutline of a shovel, it consists of two inclined planes, sloping\r\nfrom the centre, and forms a gutter and two ridges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReview for the Rural Magazine.\r\n\r\n     _An Expose of the Causes of Intemperate Drinking, and the means\r\n     by which it may be obviated. By Thomas Herttell of the city of\r\n     New York. Published by order of the New York society for the\r\n     promotion of internal improvement_.--New York, 1819.--pp. 56.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is an ingenious and interesting pamphlet. It is written with\r\nmuch force and originality; and we think we shall do the public a\r\nservice by laying before our readers some of the author's remarks.\r\nThere is no vice which steals upon us in so many attractive and\r\ndeceitful shapes as that of intemperate drinking. In this country it\r\nis a national sin and infects every class of society. We meet its\r\ntemptations in our social intercourse, at our public festivals--in\r\nthe resorts of business; we see it indulged in by men of eminent\r\ncharacter; spirituous liquors are kept in every sideboard, and\r\nbrought forth upon almost every occasion. One class of society\r\nimitates the practice of another, and habitual drunkenness has\r\nbecome the stigma and disgrace of our country.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet before us, remarks (page 6) that \"the existence of\r\nthis vice is now generally acknowledged, its progress marked, and\r\nits effects deplored. It is traced to the grog-shop where many of\r\nits most degrading _effects_ are discovered, and _mis_taken for\r\n_causes_, and the remedy attempted to be applied.\"\r\n\r\n\"Though I am not disposed to become the advocate of grog-shops, or\r\nto avert from them any portion of merited animadversion--or inclined\r\nto become the apologist of those who, under colour of keeping a\r\ntavern, follow the business of dram-selling; I am not willing\r\nthat these places should be considered either as the _primary_ or\r\n_principal cause_ of the evil under review. The current opinion that\r\nsuch is the case, is incorrect, as I shall endeavour to shew. And\r\nI am induced to do this, from the conviction that the mistake is\r\ncalculated to stop investigation short of the true source, and thus\r\nprevent the remedies from reaching the fountain-head of the evil.\r\nIt happens in this, as in too many other instances, that the little\r\nsinners become the subjects of censure, while those whose crimes\r\ndiffer from them only in magnitude, are overlooked, or treated with\r\ncomplaisance. Is it _wrong_ to sell liquor by the _glass_, to those\r\nwho drink it--and is it _not wrong to sell it by the hogshead_, for\r\nthe purpose of being so disposed of? Are both these culpable, and\r\nshall those who import and sell it by the cargo, escape obloquy?\r\nAnd does the distiller differ from all those, in any other respect,\r\nthan that he makes while they sell the poison for the purpose of\r\nits being drank? It is not my intention to censure the latter any\r\nmore than the former class of dealers in ardent drink; and justice\r\nforbids that blame should attach itself exclusively to either. They\r\nare all _particepes criminis_, inasmuch as they all contribute\r\nfacilities to the practice of intemperate drinking, and thus aid the\r\ncontinuance and increase of the evil. But its most prolific sources\r\nare not to be found among those classes of our fellow-citizens,\r\nconsidered in the _business character_. They only conform to the\r\n_customs_ and _habits_ of the community in which they live. They\r\nfind their neighbours in the practice of using ardent drink, and\r\nprofit by their folly. No one would be so weak as to invest his\r\nmoney in ardent liquor with the expectation of _learning_ people\r\nto drink. It is the _already acquired habit_, which constitutes\r\nthe basis of his calculations of profit. So far, therefore, from\r\ngrog-shops being the _primary_ or _principal cause_ of intemperate\r\nhabits, the reverse of the position approaches nearer the truth. The\r\nhabit of _intemperance is the cause of grog-shops_.\r\n\r\n\"As the vice under consideration did not originate at those places,\r\nit is not limited to the class of people who drink there. The\r\ncustomers of coffee houses, hotels, and other taverns, and the\r\nsideboards and wine-cellars of private houses, prove the truth of\r\nthis position. The landlords of those establishments would take\r\nit in dudgeon, to be told that their customers were of the lowest\r\ngrade of society; and the proprietors of well stored sideboards\r\nand wine-cellars, would be highly offended at the imputation of\r\ndrinking, or learning to drink, at grog-shops. If the practice of\r\ntippling was confined to the lower order of society, it could not\r\nwith any propriety be regarded as a national sin. The character and\r\nhabits of that class of the community can never alone constitute\r\nnational character. Admitting, therefore, that intemperate drinking\r\nis justly attributed to us as a feature of our national character,\r\nit follows irrefutably, that the _causes_ which produce that\r\n_effect_ are not confined to the purlieus of bar or tap-rooms. The\r\nupper classes of society never follow the examples of the lower: but\r\nthe latter do, as far as they are able, imitate the customs of the\r\nformer. Had the habit of intemperance originated in the lower class,\r\nit would not, in all probability, have extended beyond it. As its\r\nprevalence is so general as to become a reproach to the nation, the\r\ninference is conclusive, that it is the progeny of higher parentage\r\nthan grog-shops.\"\r\n\r\n\"The radical sources of the evil\" says judge Herttell, \"are _in the\r\nfashions, customs, and examples, of what are called the upper or\r\nwealthy classes of the community_.\"\r\n\r\nAfter remarking the common practice that intoxicating liquors are\r\nuniversally used as a table drink, he proceeds, \"Such being the\r\npractice, the parents of a family must, of necessity, adopt one\r\nof the two following measures:--The children must be permitted to\r\npartake of the common table beverage, or they must not. In the\r\nfirst case they are reared from their childhood to the _habitual\r\nuse of ardent drink_. If the other course is pursued, and the use\r\nof the liquor interdicted to the children, while the parents daily\r\ndrink it in their presence, he is very little acquainted with\r\nhuman nature, who does not know, that the value of the article\r\nis thereby arbitrarily enhanced--the disposition to enjoy it\r\nincreased,--and, that as soon as the restraints of the parents are\r\nremoved, and an opportunity presents, the forbidden fruit will be\r\ntasted, with as much avidity as if both conscience and justice\r\ndemanded satisfaction for lost time and pleasures. Under such\r\ncircumstances, how vain is it to hope that children will not acquire\r\nthe habit of intemperance--and how weak is it to wonder at their\r\nbecoming drunkards! Parents can hardly be said to have arrived\r\nto years of discretion, who shall expect that their admonitions\r\nagainst intemperance will be heeded, while their daily example is\r\ncounteracting their influence. How ridiculous is it for them, while\r\ndrinking wine and brandy in the presence of their children, to\r\nattempt to persuade them, that it is not good for them! Should it\r\nhappen, that in a family of half a dozen sons, there should be a\r\nsober man, the merit is his, and not his parents'; nor are they to\r\nbe pitied, except for their folly, should they all be drunkards; and\r\nsuch is frequently the result. Thus, almost every family becomes a\r\nschool for intemperance, and a nursery of customers for taverns and\r\ngrog-shops.\r\n\r\n\"Again; inebriating liquors have become the medium _universally\r\nadopted by society for manifesting friendship and good will, one\r\nto another_. It need only to be mentioned to be admitted, that it\r\nis the common practice, when friends or even strangers visit each\r\nother, they have scarcely time after being seated, to make the usual\r\ninquiries about health, and the common place remarks on the weather,\r\nbefore they are invited to drink intoxicating liquors. The welcome\r\nis deemed kind and sincere, in proportion to the frequency, and\r\nearnestness of the importunities to drink--liberal in proportion\r\nto the variety of the liquors; and their richness and profusion\r\nadd to the other temptations to drink. Not to offer them would be\r\ndeemed unfriendly, mean, or unmannerly. Not to accept them, would\r\nbe attributed to ill-nature, or a want of politeness. Hence, the\r\nvisitor drinks to reciprocate good will for the proffered kindness,\r\nor in self-defence against the imputation of ill-breeding. And the\r\nvisited, takes a glass for the company's sake, as it is called;\r\nand to evince his satisfaction on seeing his hospitality accepted\r\n_in the spirit_ in which it is offered. In this way do the laws of\r\n_fashion_ and _custom constrain people to drink_, who otherwise\r\nwould have no inclination, or who have acquired that inclination,\r\nfrom the frequent if not daily occasions which occur, for tendering\r\nand reciprocating through the customary channel, sentiments of\r\nhospitality and good will to their associates, friends, and\r\nstrangers. _Thus is the vice of intemperate drinking ingrafted on\r\nthe virtue of hospitality_; and so long as that virtue is cherished,\r\nand ardent liquors continue to be tendered as evidence of its\r\nexistence, so long will the use of that article as a drink continue,\r\nand the vice of intemperance grow out of it. _This unnatural\r\nblending of virtue and vice, together with the practice of using\r\ninebriating drink as a table beverage, are the radical sources of\r\nthat intemperance, which is said to be \"the crying and increasing\r\nsin of the nation.\"_ It is at the family table, the first rudiments\r\nof intemperance are taught; the first examples set, and the first\r\nessays at tippling attempted. The practice is continued by the\r\nfrequent display of hospitality and politeness, through the medium\r\nof ardent drink. The _acquired habit_, shows itself on holy-days, at\r\ndining and other parties, and on all convivial occasions--is pursued\r\nat taverns, and at last, descends to, and terminates its career at\r\ngrog-shops. Look at the catalogue of family misfortunes, and few\r\nwill be found to have escaped the direful disease of intemperance;\r\nfew which have not had their prosperity and happiness blighted by\r\nthe extreme of that vice, in some one or more of their members.\"\r\nNo doubt it is in the opulent that many of the vices of society\r\noriginate. Their weaknesses and errors are palliated; their example\r\nimitated and their indulgences eagerly craved by the poor. While\r\ntherefore, the general practice of using ardent spirit continues\r\namong them, our author reasons that the popular remedy of curtailing\r\nthe number of grog-shops, though it would lessen the _practice_\r\nwould not _destroy_ the habit of intemperance. Should there\r\nremain a solitary place where liquor can be procured, the sin of\r\nintemperance will continue to be committed, and its associate vices\r\nand immorality entailed on society.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" says he, \"it may be asked by the reader, are we required to\r\nrelinquish the use of wine and ardent spirits, in order to prevent\r\ntheir abuse by others? Shall we deny ourselves the _reasonable\r\nenjoyment_ of them, because others become _intemperate_? Are we to\r\nbe interdicted the _moderate_ use of them, because others drink to\r\nexcess and get drunk? As well say the querists, might it be expected\r\nthat we should extract our tongues, because others back-bite their\r\nneighbours!\r\n\r\n\"In the first place, permit me to remark, that I have not uttered a\r\nword against the _moderate_ or _reasonable_ use of ardent liquors.\r\nBut before we go farther, it may be proper to analyze the terms,\r\n_moderation_ and _intemperance_, as they relate to the use of\r\ninebriating drink. There can be no objection to its _reasonable_,\r\n_necessary_, and _moderate_ use. But I do contend, that the use\r\nof it by any person _in a full state of health, is at all times\r\nunnecessary_. The effect of strong drink, is to excite the animal\r\nspirits to a preternatural action.--When taken by a person in full\r\nhealth, it raises the animal spirits above the healthy standard.\r\nThis is _unnecessary_--and inasmuch as it creates a deviation\r\nfrom a state of real health, it produces _disease_, and hence\r\nits use is _immoderate_, _intemperate_. The _indirect debility_\r\nwhich succeeds the exhausted stimulant, is another and a worse\r\nstate of _disorder_, which goes to confirm the truth, that the\r\n_first_ draught of ardent drink taken by those in full health,\r\nis _unnecessary_, _unreasonable_, and _excessive_. Nor is this\r\nall--this indirect debility prompts a repetition of the draught--and\r\nnow the _practice_ of drinking has commenced. The animal spirits\r\nhaving sunk as far below as they have been raised above the healthy\r\nstandard, an _increased_ quantity is required to raise them as\r\nhigh as before. Thus the habit of intemperance _progresses_. The\r\nspirits, now ebbing lower than before, demand increased support, the\r\nyielding to which demand, _confirms the habit of intemperance_. But\r\nit unfortunately happens, that the term _moderate_, when applied\r\nto intoxicating drink, by those who use it, is as unmeaning as the\r\nword _enough_ in the mouth of a miser, when speaking of his money.\r\nEach drinks according to his taste and strength of habit, and calls\r\nit _moderate_. Thus every grade of drinking, from the single glass\r\nof the novice, to the full bottle of the initiated, is termed\r\n_moderate_. And every degree of excitement, from _moderately merry_\r\nto _moderately drunk_, is honoured with the same name. The real\r\ntruth is, it is a poor apology for a bad practice; and a _moderate_\r\ndegree of reflection would lead those not slaves to the habit, to\r\nview it in that light.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have the authority of distinguished physicians for remarking,\r\nthat next to _intemperate eating_, intemperate _drinking_ engenders\r\nmore bodily diseases, than any other single cause. That _more die_\r\nof disorders occasioned by drinking, _before they become drunkards_,\r\nthan _live to extend their intemperance to that extreme_. That the\r\nconstant exercise of the labouring class, _procrastinates_, while\r\nthe want of exercise tends to _facilitate_ the fatal effects of\r\nintemperance in the other class of society--and hence it is, that\r\nthe _moderate drinking_, as it is modestly termed, of the _latter_,\r\ndestroys at least as many as the _drunkenness of the former_, and\r\nin that ratio is as injurious to the community. The reason these\r\nfacts are not subjects of general observation, is, that when people\r\nwho are not reputed drunkards, die of complaints brought on by\r\ndrinking, their death is imputed to the disorder, while that escapes\r\nbeing attributed to its true cause--whereas, reputed drunkards\r\nstand little or no chance of dying by any other means; for be they\r\ndrowned by accident or hanged for murder, their end is generally,\r\nand perhaps too often, correctly ascribed to intemperate drinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is really wonderful to witness how fertile is the love of\r\nardent liquor, in excuses and pretences for its gratification. It\r\nis drank at one time, _because the weather is warm_--at another,\r\n_because it is cold_. It is drank with enemies \"to _reconcile\r\nthem_\"--with friends, \"_because they don't meet every day_\"--on\r\nall festive, anniversary and other holydays, \"_because they\r\nonly come once a year_.\" And if at any or on all those times,\r\nthe bounds of _moderation_ are exceeded, it is allowed to be\r\n_excusable_, \"_because they are all extraordinary occasions!_\" Real\r\nor _pretended_ disorders are also often plead as an apology for\r\ndrinking ardent liquor; and instances are not rare where, though\r\nit may have been regularly prescribed for medical purposes, and\r\nmay have cured the disorder, it has finally killed the patient. It\r\nis doubtless for this reason, that distinguished gentlemen of the\r\nfaculty have admitted, that the internal use of ardent liquor, even\r\nin cases in which it is indicated as a medical remedy, is often\r\nproductive of far more hurt than good.\r\n\r\n\"The most common pretence, however, is, that _the water is bad_, and\r\nrequires a _little spirits to qualify it_; and hence it is infused\r\nwith a poison of a more deleterious quality than any it naturally\r\npossessed. This _qualifying_ of the water, has been the means of\r\n_disqualifying_ many a valuable man, for nearly every purpose,\r\nexcept to bring disgrace, ruin, and misery on himself, his family\r\nand connexions.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have taken no pains to ascertain the authority by which retailers\r\nof ardent drink are permitted to fix stands and booths at the Park\r\nand other places, on days of public parade and festivity. The\r\nconcentrating of so many grog-shops at times and places of the\r\ngreatest collection of people, tends rather to produce tumult and\r\nconfusion, than to preserve good order. These places not only tempt\r\nmen to indulge to excess, but boys are often seen in them following\r\nthe example--and it has been remarked, that more of this youthful\r\nclass are seen disguised with liquor on those days, than in all the\r\nyear beside. Indeed, it very rarely occurs that a boy is seen thus\r\ndegraded on any other occasion. Should these travelling taverns\r\nbe permitted only on condition that ardent spirits should not be\r\ncarried to them, or sold, or given gratis there, it would remove\r\nthe greatest objection which can be urged against them. The public\r\nwould then be accommodated with every necessary refreshment, without\r\njeopardizing their peace by means of intemperate drinking.\r\n\r\n\"It would essentially benefit the community, should the _inducements\r\nto frequent taverns be lessened_. This may be done in a variety of\r\ninstances. It is usual in the country towns, to muster the militia\r\nat or in the immediate vicinity of taverns. This practice tends\r\nneither to improve the morality or discipline of the men--and if\r\nthey must continue as now to be mustered at those places or _not\r\nmustered at all_, I have no hesitation in saying, that the public\r\nwould sustain no material injury, should the latter course be\r\nadopted; for it is certainly true, and the reason is obvious, that\r\nmany of the men, at the close of their exercise on those parade\r\ndays, are not so well qualified to serve their country, as when they\r\ncome to the rendezvous. Much of the evil of the present practice\r\nwould be obviated, should military officers, vested with power to\r\nmuster any corps of militia, in the country towns, for the ordinary\r\npurposes of exercise or inspection, be bound by law to locate the\r\nparade ground at least a mile from any tavern or retail grocery. The\r\ncarrying of ardent liquor to the rendezvous, and the selling it\r\nthere, or giving it gratis to any person, especially the soldiers,\r\nshould be interdicted, under proper penalties, and provision made\r\nfor due execution of the law. Other refreshments than ardent drink,\r\nbeing as usual permitted, all the reasonable conveniences of taverns\r\nwould be enjoyed, and many of those disgusting instances of riot and\r\ndisturbance, occasioned by intemperate drinking, and which often\r\nconvert our militia parades in the country, into scenes of disorder\r\nand insubordination, rather than schools for military instruction\r\nand discipline, would be done away.\r\n\r\n\"The legislature should prohibit justices' courts being held at\r\ntaverns. The disgraceful scenes which are too often the consequences\r\nof trials at those places, would thereby be prevented, and the cause\r\nof _morality_, and not unfrequently, that of _justice_, essentially\r\nbenefited. The same objection lies, though perhaps not with equal\r\nforce, against sheriff's courts being held at those places. If the\r\nCourt House is not at hand, it must be a beggarly office which would\r\nnot afford the appropriating of a room for the performance of its\r\nduties in the dwelling of its incumbent, or pay for the use of a\r\nconvenient place elsewhere for the purpose. The practice of holding\r\ntrials at taverns, before referees, appointed by order of the court,\r\nis not exempt from serious objections.--These, however, being less\r\nfrequent, are not so productive of evil, and, perhaps, are more\r\ndifficult to be obviated.\r\n\r\n\"The holding of auction sales at taverns, as is frequently the case\r\nin the country, is pregnant with mischief sufficient to justify\r\nlegislative interposition.--Those who have witnessed, can best\r\ndescribe them--I only know them by description. On these occasions,\r\nthe number who go to buy, is but small, compared to those who attend\r\nfrom other motives. The owner of the property for sale, is seldom\r\nbackward in circulating the glass freely at his own expense,\r\nbecause he is like to receive more than cent. per cent. profit\r\nfrom the consequent indiscretion of those who become affected with\r\nthe _spirit of bidding_. Many are thus led on to buy unnecessarily\r\nand dear; and frequent instances occur, where people bid off more\r\nthan they have means to pay for--and thence law-suits, trials, at\r\ntaverns, family distress, the insolvent act, and perhaps poverty\r\nand pauperism close the account. These are only the outlines of the\r\npicture, which those who have seen the original, are best qualified\r\nto fill up with neglect of _domestic concerns_--_horse-racing_ and\r\n_jockeying_--_profane swearing_--_drunkenness_--_quarrelling_, and\r\nsometimes _fighting_, and a variety of other _amusements_, not\r\nunusual on such occasions.\r\n\r\n\"The lamentable consequences of holding the polls of our political\r\nelections at public houses, are too generally known to require\r\nparticular description. Suffice it to say, that the noise and\r\ntumult--the heated, irritating and useless discussions which\r\nfrequently occur, and which go to impair the respectability of the\r\nelectors, and the credit of the elective franchise, are oftner the\r\nresult of the _spirit of liquor_ than the _spirit of patriotism_.\r\nAs far as legislative provisions can obviate the evil, it ought to\r\nbe done. The expense would be small and the benefit great, should\r\neach ward in the cities, and each town in the country, build a house\r\nor room for the purpose of elections. The profit which might accrue\r\nfrom its use on other occasions, would, in many instances, more\r\nthan pay the interest on its cost. It is a little remarkable, that\r\nthe sagacity which prompted the interdiction of military parades on\r\nthe days of election, as dangerous to the freedom of the elective\r\nfranchise, did not foresee and guard against the evils consequent on\r\nlocating the election polls at public houses.\r\n\r\n\"It is hoped that the good sense of the community will operate to\r\nabolish the custom of giving extravagant entertainments, on any\r\noccasion, in honour of distinguished characters. This practice,\r\nby leading many to taverns, and tempting them to indulge freely,\r\nis productive of more mischief than benefit to society. As an\r\nexample, it is bad. People, in the lower walks of life, cannot be\r\ntaught, that it is wrong to get drunk in company with, and out\r\nof mere good humour to their friends, while they see too many of\r\nthe upper circles retire from those feasts, not exactly sober. I\r\nhumbly conceive it would be manifesting far higher respect for a\r\ngreat man, to compliment him with a written address, approbating\r\nhis character and conduct, accompanied with a medal, a piece of\r\nplate, or other present, embellished with appropriate insignia and\r\ninscriptions.--These would be lasting testimonials of character and\r\nworth. Being always visible, they would act continually as a stimuli\r\nto urge others to emulate the honourable course by which they were\r\nacquired;--whereas, those public entertainments are scarcely noticed\r\nbeyond the day they are _puffed_ in the newspapers--and if they\r\nwere, the honoured guest could derive no great satisfaction in the\r\nreflection, that his friends had _eaten_ and _drank immoderately_,\r\nin _honour of his virtues_. There is a strong family likeness\r\nbetween these dinners and those _eaten ex-officio_ by our city\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\n\"The meetings of self-created societies at taverns, cannot, perhaps,\r\nat all times, be well avoided. There doubtless are many of those\r\ninstitutions which are useful--but that there are many which do\r\nmore hurt than good, is equally true. They ought, indeed, to be\r\nproductive of great benefit, to counterbalance the evil tendency\r\nthey have, to draw their members to taverns at night. Many a good\r\ncitizen has, in this way, unwarily contracted irregular habits--and\r\nmany a deserving wife, and family of innocent babes, have had reason\r\nto lament the truth of this remark. It will be a great pity, if\r\nthose societies cannot be prevailed on, to procure places at which\r\nto hold their meetings.--This might easily be effected, unless too\r\nstrong a predeliction for tavern meetings should counteract so\r\nreasonable a proposition.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the year 1740, Admiral Vernon commanded the British fleet in\r\nthe West Indies. His undress coat was made of _grogram_, a cloth\r\nfabricated of silk and worsted. He was very unpopular in the fleet,\r\nand the sailors, in allusion to his coat, nick-named him _Old\r\nGrogram_; and afterwards, by way of shortening it, they called him\r\n_Old Grog_. When ardent liquor was first given to sailors, and until\r\nthe time above-mentioned, it was drank _raw_--but being found to\r\nproduce many fatal bodily diseases, and the naval service thereby\r\nmuch injured, the Admiral directed that the rum should be weakened\r\nwith water. The men were highly displeased at having their drink\r\nthus _spoiled_, and in derision of the admiral, called it by his\r\nabbreviated nick-name, \"_Grog._\" This is the reason that rum, mixed\r\nwith water, bears that name. Let it be observed, _because_ the\r\n_raw_ rum was found to produce deleterious effects on the health\r\nof the sailors, the Admiral ordered that it should be mixed with\r\nwater. Now, as it probably could not require many years to make that\r\ndiscovery, it is fair to conclude, that the first use of ardent\r\nspirits, as a daily drink on ship-board, could not have been a very\r\ngreat length of time anterior to the year 1740.\"\r\n\r\n\"On another occasion, I have mentioned, and will here repeat,\r\nthat the baleful practice of giving ardent liquor to labourers,\r\nought to be exploded. This custom has so powerfully aided other\r\ncauses of intemperance, that there is scarcely to be found among\r\nthe labouring class, any who do not drink, and drink too much. It\r\nis unquestionably owing, in a great measure, to this, that the\r\napprentices to many mechanical branches, are initiated into the\r\nhabit of intemperance, before they acquire a knowledge of their\r\ntrade; and it is certainly owing to the same cause, that many do\r\nnot gain a perfect knowledge of their business. Here, too, we see a\r\npowerful objection operating, to prevent many respectable parents\r\nfrom putting their sons to mechanical occupations. Hence, many a\r\npromising mechanical genius is smothered in the warehouse, or doomed\r\nto add a useless member to the already over-run and over-rated\r\nlearned professions. This serves to degrade the honourable calling\r\nof mechanics, which suffers another depression from the necessity\r\nwhich these circumstance create, of taking apprentices from the\r\nlower circles of society, whose want of the requisite education\r\ndisqualifies them for attaining an adequate knowledge of their\r\ntrade. In addition to this, the master mechanic, growing wealthy\r\nby his business, too often becomes infected with the follies\r\nand _fashions_ of upper life--in which sphere some are fitted\r\nonly to appear ridiculous. Their sons, forsooth, must be _above_\r\ntheir fathers' business. They must be brought up gentlemen--and,\r\nof course, reared in idleness and extravagance, or become\r\n_professionable_ men or _merchants_.--Thus, by their conduct,\r\nthey give countenance to those whose weakness may dispose them to\r\nundervalue mechanical occupations.\r\n\r\n\"The great number of public holy-days (as they are termed) which\r\nare generally observed, are not without their pernicious influence\r\non the morals of society.--Was the manner of their celebration\r\nsuch as to honour the events they are intended to commemorate,\r\ntheir observance, if not useful, would at least be innocent in\r\ntheir consequences. But were we to judge their objects solely by\r\nthe manner in which they are kept, and the effects they produce,\r\nwe might be led to the erroneous conclusion, that they were\r\ninstituted to subserve the causes of vice and immorality. The\r\ngeneral suspension of useful employment on those days, is followed\r\nby an increased indulgence in drinking; and this accounts for\r\nthere being more crimes committed on those days, than in any other\r\nequal period of time. On the authority of a gentleman who was on\r\nthe Grand Jury which sat in the present year, I state, that far\r\nthe greatest portion of the business of that Jury, grew out of\r\ncrimes and disorders committed during the Christmas and New-Year\r\nholy-days. When it is observed, that the court for the trial of\r\ncriminals is held once a month, and crowded with business, it would\r\nbe superfluous to add arguments to such facts.\r\n\r\n\"The custom of giving wine and other liquors at funerals, is not at\r\nall calculated to increase the solemnity of those occasions. The\r\npractice is bad, and ought to be discountenanced by those whose\r\nexample may influence others to follow it. Instances have happened,\r\nwhere the _effects_ of this _ill-timed hospitality_, have been very\r\njustly lamented. How such an absurd custom was first introduced, is\r\nnot, perhaps, so evident as the impropriety of its continuance.\r\n\r\n\"To conclude--'To what purpose,' an inconsiderate though\r\nwell-intentioned friend, has said, and others as thoughtless,\r\nmay say, 'do you attempt to write down the use of ardent drink?\r\nNotwithstanding all you have said, or may say, people will continue\r\nto drink as usual.' In the first place, I answer, _I am not sure\r\nof that_--and in the next place, _I am sure_, that if they will\r\ncontinue to use spirituous liquor as _a daily table drink_, and\r\ngive and receive it as the _token_ of _friendship_ and _good will_,\r\nthereby associating the _vice_ of _drinking_ with the _virtue_ of\r\n_hospitality_--if they will _accustom their children to the use_ or\r\n_witness_ the use of ardent drink, and rear them in _idleness_ and\r\n_extravagance_, with the mistaken idea of thus making them _ladies_\r\nand _gentlemen_--if they will continue to 'have wine in their\r\n(public) feasts,' and license taverns by thousands, and create a\r\nthousand temptations to frequent them--if they will persist in the\r\npractice of giving strong drink to the working class of society,\r\nand _thereby contribute to degrade their character, and bring\r\nuseful industry_ into contempt--if they will continue to celebrate\r\ntheir anniversaries by a course of unrestrained intemperance--then,\r\nI again repeat, _I am sure_, that notwithstanding all their\r\nprofessions of patriotism, morality, philanthropy and religion, they\r\ncannot escape the imputation of loving ardent spirits more than the\r\nwork of reformation: and moreover, cannot avert, and will merit all\r\nthe ills which are flowing, and must continue to flow, from the\r\ndemoralizing influence of intoxicating drink. Intemperance, the\r\nreigning sin of the nation, will go on 'increasing to increase,'\r\ntill immorality, spreading far and wide, shall debase the people,\r\ncorrupt their rulers, and destroy the liberties of our country.\r\nThen dark illimited despotism, with its genial concomitant, blind\r\nsuperstition, weak-minded bigotry, and black-hearted fanaticism;\r\nwhile forging the chains, preparing the wheel, and igniting the\r\nfaggots of unholy and merciless persecution, will rear its head, and\r\nimpiously exult in the downfall of the only government on earth,\r\nthe existence of which, is not a reproach to the common sense of\r\nmankind.\"\r\n\r\n  \"_New York, January, 1819._\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A view of Botany Bay._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 63d number of the Edinburgh Review, for July last, we find an\r\ninteresting account of the settlement called Botany Bay in New South\r\nWales, discovered by the Dutch in 1616, and taken possession of by\r\nthe British in 1770. On the close of the war by which the United\r\nStates obtained their independence, the government of Great Britain,\r\nat a loss for a receptacle for convicts sentenced to banishment, at\r\nlast selected this remote country, and made the first settlement\r\nthere in 1778. This colony, now a very flourishing one, was thus\r\nplanted with the rogues of England, Ireland and Scotland, sent\r\nthither, in exile, as a punishment for their crimes--transportation\r\nto that distant and savage land being more dreaded there, perhaps,\r\nthan our penitentiary is here, from which escapes are made with\r\nso much facility--the _certainty_ of punishment deterring from\r\nthe commission of crime more than its _severity_. The criminals\r\nlanded in this southern clime, finding themselves placed in a\r\nnew situation, where little could be got by theft, and having a\r\nbetter chance than in the mother country of earning a comfortable\r\nsubsistence, often changed their habits, and became industrious, if\r\nnot honest men. They are probably destined to be a great nation,\r\nhaving an abundant scope of territory, 2,700 miles in length, and\r\n2,000 in breadth, (three-fourths the extent of Europe,) and will,\r\nat a future day, in imitation of America, cast off the shackles of\r\ncolonial subjection, and assert the prerogative of self-government.\r\n\r\nThe climate of Botany Bay is represented to be equal to any in\r\nEurope, but rather Asiatic than European--Favourable on the whole\r\nto health and longevity. December, January, and February, are the\r\nsummer months of that country, and then the heat, which at noon is\r\nat 80 deg. is tempered by a strong sea-breeze. The winter months,\r\nJune, July, and August, have very cold nights, and fire through the\r\nday is comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe Reviewer humorously calls this colony \"a land of convicts and\r\nkangaroos,\" and sportively observes, that, \"in this remote part of\r\nthe earth Nature (having made horses, oxen, ducks, geese, oaks,\r\nelms, and all regular and useful productions, for the rest of the\r\nworld) seems determined to have a bit of play, and to amuse herself\r\nas she pleases. Accordingly, she makes cherries with the stone on\r\nthe outside; and a monstrous animal, as tall as a granadier, with\r\nthe head of a rabbit, a tail as big as a bed-post, hopping at the\r\nrate of five hops to a mile, with three or four young kangaroos\r\nlooking out of its false uterus to see what is passing. Then comes\r\na quadruped as big as a large cat, with the eyes, colour, and skin\r\nof a mole, and the bill and web-feet of a duck--'puzzling Dr. Shaw'\r\nand rendering the latter half of his life miserable, from his utter\r\ninability to determine whether it was a bird or a beast. Add to this\r\na parrot, with the legs of a sea-gull; a skate with the head of a\r\nshark, and a bird of such monstrous dimensions that a side bone of\r\nit will dine three real carnivorous Englishmen; together with many\r\nother productions that agitate Sir Joseph, and fill him with mingled\r\nemotions of distress and delight.\"\r\n\r\nThe colony has made the following progress:\r\n\r\n                      In 1778.             1817.\r\n  Horned cattle            5              44,753\r\n  Horses                   7               3,072\r\n  Sheep                   29             170,920\r\n  Hogs                    74              17,842\r\n  Land cultivated    _none_ acres,          47,564\r\n  Inhabitants          1,000              20,379\r\n\r\nSydney, the principal town and seat of government, has a population\r\nof 7000 souls; it has a newspaper, a bank, and many public\r\nand private buildings, that would not disgrace the best parts\r\nof London--So says Mr. Wentworth, a native of Botany Bay, who\r\nhas lately published a statistical, historical, and political\r\ndescription of the country.\r\n\r\nThe attention paid to the education of the children, by their\r\n\"larcenous forefathers,\" is worthy of commendation and of imitation\r\nin other parts of the world, where the morals of the parent stock\r\nare less depraved. \"The town of Sydney contains 2 good public\r\nschools, for the education of 224 children of both sexes. There\r\nare establishments also for the diffusion of education in every\r\npopulous district throughout the colony: the masters of these\r\nschools are allowed stipulated salaries from the Orphans' fund. Mr.\r\nWentworth states, that one-eighth part of the whole revenue of the\r\ncolony is appropriated to the purposes of education: this eighth he\r\ncomputes at 2500_l._ Independent of these institutions, there is an\r\nAuxiliary Bible Society, a Sunday School, and several good private\r\nschools. This is all as it should he: The education of the poor,\r\nimportant every where, is indispensable at Botany Bay. Nothing but\r\nthe earliest attention to the habits of children can restrain the\r\nerratic finger from the contiguous scrip, to prevent the hereditary\r\ntendency of larcenous abstraction. The American arrangements\r\nrespecting the education of the lower orders, is excellent. Their\r\nunsold lands are surveyed, and divided into districts. In the centre\r\nof every district, an ample and well selected lot is provided for\r\nthe support of future schools. We wish this had been imitated in\r\nNew Holland; for we are of opinion that the elevated nobleman,\r\nLord Sidmouth, should intimate what is good and wise, even if the\r\nAmericans are his teachers. Mr. Wentworth talks of 15,000 acres set\r\napart for the support of the Female Orphan schools; which certainly\r\ndoes sound a little extravagant; but then 50 or 100 acres of this\r\nreserve are given as a portion to each female orphan; so that all\r\nthis pious tract of ground will be soon married away. This donation\r\nof women, in a place where they are scarce, is amiable and foolish\r\nenough. There is a school also for the education and civilization\r\nof the natives, we hope not to the exclusion of the children of\r\nconvicts, who have clearly a prior claim upon public charity.\"\r\n\r\nGreat exertions have been made in public roads and bridges. Toll\r\ngates have been established on all the principal roads. The general\r\naverage of unimproved land in the neighbourhood of the town is 5_l._\r\nsterling per acre. The inhabitants of New South Wales have suffered\r\ngreatly from the tyranny and caprice of the rulers placed over them\r\nby Britain. There is no sufficient check on the Governor of the\r\ncolony--far from the parent country, there is no Council to restrain\r\nhis excesses, nor any Colonial Legislature to assert the rights of\r\nthe people. There is no trial by jury. The Governor imposes what\r\ntaxes he pleases.\r\n\r\n  [_Geo. Journal._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTELLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDied, at Windsor Castle, George William Frederic Guelph on the 29th\r\nof January.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty George the Third, was born on the 24th of May, 1738,\r\nwhich since the alteration of the style, has become the 4th of\r\nJune. At his death, therefore, he had reached the advanced age of\r\neighty-one years seven months and twenty-six days. He was proclaimed\r\nking on the 25th of October, 1760.--On September 8th, 1761, he was\r\nmarried to her late majesty, and had issue seven sons and five\r\ndaughters, of whom six of the former and four of the latter survive\r\nhim. His royal highness the Prince of Wales was appointed Regent\r\non the 6th of Feb. 1811, and from that time he has been virtual\r\nsovereign, acting in the name and on the behalf of his majesty. His\r\nmajesty, from the appointment of the Regent, remained in retirement\r\nat Windsor Castle, under the guardianship of a council, who met\r\nevery month, or more frequently as occasions might require, and\r\nissued a report of the state of his indisposition.\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his late majesty had been formally announced, the\r\nfollowing instrument was prepared and signed.\r\n\r\n\"Whereas, it hath pleased the Almighty God, to call to his mercy\r\nour late sovereign lord, king George the 3d. of blessed memory, by\r\nwhose decease the imperial crown of the united kingdom of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland, is solely and rightfully come to the high and\r\nmighty prince, George prince of Wales: We, therefore, the lords\r\nspiritual and temporal of this realm, being here assisted with those\r\nof his late majesty's privy council, with numbers of other principal\r\ngentlemen of quality, with the lord mayor, aldermen and citizens\r\nof London, do now hereby, with one voice and consent, of tongue\r\nand heart, publish and proclaim, that the high and mighty prince,\r\nGeorge, prince of Wales, is now, by the death of the late sovereign,\r\nof happy memory, become our only lawful and rightful liege, lord\r\nGeorge the 4th. by the grace of God, king of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, defender of the faith, &c. to whom we do acknowledge all\r\nfaith and constant obedience, with all hearty and humble affection;\r\nbeseeching God, by whom kings and queens do reign, to bless the\r\nroyal prince, George the 4th with long and happy years, to reign\r\nover us.\r\n\r\nGiven at the court at Carlton-house, this 30th day of January, 1820.\r\n\r\n  GOD SAVE THE KING.\"\r\n\r\nThen follows the signature of the Privy councillors, &c. present.\r\n\r\nThe king's fourth son, Edward Guelph, duke of Kent, &c. died at\r\nSidmouth, after a short but very severe illness on the 23d of\r\nJanuary. He was born November 2, 1767.\r\n\r\nThe interment of the king of England, took place on the 16th of\r\nFebruary; and on the following day, both houses of parliament\r\nconvened according to adjournment. A message from the new king\r\nwas received and read, and _an address of condolence and\r\ncongratulation_ was adopted in the house of lords.\r\n\r\nA new parliament is to be summoned; and great activity every where\r\nprevails in preparing for the approaching general election.\r\n\r\n_Ancient Custom._--On the day that the present King was to be\r\nproclaimed as George the Fourth, a procession was formed fronting\r\nthe Palace of Carlton-house, and proceeded for the city, when, on\r\nthe cavalcade arriving at Temple-bar they found the gates, according\r\nto ancient custom, closed. \"The City Marshall was sent forward to\r\nthe gate, intimation having been given to the lord Mayor that there\r\nwas a loud knocking at the gate, and a demand of admittance from\r\nsome persons outside. The Marshall went to the gate, and asked, 'Who\r\nknocks,' and was answered, 'The Herald King at Arms. I attend with\r\na warrant to proclaim King George the Fourth. Open your gates.' The\r\nCity Marshall answered, 'I shall inform the Lord Mayor that you are\r\nwaiting at the gate.' The Marshall then rode back to the Lord Mayor,\r\nand having informed him that the Herald King at Arms was in waiting\r\nfor admission, to proclaim George the Fourth, King of England, was\r\ndirected by his Lordship to give the admission required, which was\r\nto be limited to the Herald King at Arms. The Marshall upon going\r\nto the gates, said to the officers, 'Open one side of the gates\r\nand admit the Herald King at Arms, and him alone.' The Herald then\r\nrode in, supported by his guards, and was accompanied by the City\r\nMarshall to the Lord Mayor. The Herald King at Arms presented\r\nthe warrant.--The Lord Mayor immediately said, 'admit the whole\r\nprocession into our city of London.'\"\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Heard, the Garter-King-at-Arms, is 90 years of age.\r\n\r\nGeorge the 4th was proclaimed as King, at Liverpool, without parade,\r\non the 31st of Jan. but was proclaimed there again on the 19th\r\nof Feb. with much pomp and ceremony.--There was a grand military\r\nand civil procession; and among the latter, all the mechanic\r\nprofessions, each with appropriate standards.\r\n\r\nThe late King is said to have given between 60 and $70,000 a year in\r\ncharities.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _London_, Feb. 18.\r\n\r\nWe have received this morning the Paris papers of Tuesday. They\r\nare, of course, painfully interesting, for they communicate a\r\nvariety of facts connected with the assassination of his Royal\r\nHighness the Duke de Berri. Among the most important of these is\r\nthe undeniable one, that the atrocious crime was committed from\r\npolitical motives. This alarming truth was distinctly admitted,\r\nnot only by the Members of the two Chambers, who met to address\r\nhis Majesty, upon the mournful occasion but it is recognized by\r\nthe King himself, in the concluding sentence of his answer to the\r\nAddress of the Deputies.--\"The Chamber cannot doubt,\" said his\r\nMajesty, \"that, feeling as a man, and acting as a king, I shall\r\nadopt every necessary measure to preserve the _State from dangers,\r\nof which I am but too forcibly forewarned by the crime of this\r\nday_.\" The assassin himself, indeed, according to the letter of our\r\nprivate correspondent, upon being interrogated, avowed that he had\r\nexterminated the Duke, as the youngest of the Royal Family, \"knowing\r\nthat nature would soon relieve him from the necessity of abridging\r\nthe days of the King.\"\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Berri was in his 42d year, and was, next to his aged\r\nfather, Count d'Artois, heir to the throne.\r\n\r\n\"The assassin is about 30 years of age; his name is Louvel. It\r\nappears he was one of those who went and returned with Bonaparte\r\nfrom Elba, and has since been employed, up to the very time of the\r\nfatal deed, in his Majesty's hunting establishment.\r\n\r\nA vessel has arrived at Portsmouth from St. Helena, which place\r\nshe left on the 10th of December. Bonaparte, at that time, was\r\nwell, and continued his out-door exercise, in the grounds attached\r\nto Longwood. \"His new house was nearly ready for his reception,\r\nand it is in every respect a most spacious and commodious mansion;\r\ncontaining, with a ball room, 17 excellent rooms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom a late report of the Secretary of the Treasury it appears that\r\nthe banking capital of the United States, including the United\r\nStates' bank, and excluding all banks incorporated since 1817,\r\namounts to $125,000,000.\r\n\r\nA curious circumstance occurred on Monday week at Market Levington,\r\nWilts. A person named Jane Webb attended divine service attired\r\nprecisely in the same suit of mourning for our late sovereign George\r\nIII. as was worn by her for king George II. The singularity of its\r\nmake, attracted much notice. This venerable and frugal spinster has\r\nattained her 76th year.\r\n\r\nAn oil spring has been discovered in the county of Morgan, Ohio,\r\nwhich is stated to yield an inexhaustible quantity of this liquid.\r\nIt sells for fifty cents a gallon. It is used for lamps, for\r\ncurrying leather, for mixing in medicines, &c. Whether it is\r\ncalculated for mixing in paints had not been ascertained.\r\n\r\n_Worm in a Horse's eye._--Dr. William Scott, of Madras, has\r\nextracted a worm from the aqueous humour of a horse's eye to which\r\nhe gave the name of _Accaris pellucidus_.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of New Jersey has passed a law for incorporating a\r\ncompany for the purpose of embanking and draining the salt marsh on\r\nBarbadoes neck in that state.\r\n\r\nIn the British Quarterly Review, mention is made of a British\r\nstatute now in force, in which the punishment of a certain offence\r\nis _transportation_ for 14 years; and on conviction, one half\r\nthereof is to go to the _informer_, and the other half to the\r\n_king_! Did ever an Irish parliament make such a blunder as this?\r\n\r\n_Virginia_ is much engaged in laying out works of internal\r\nimprovement; especially with a project of uniting the waters of\r\nJames river with those of Kenawha.\r\n\r\n_The Bordeaux ship of discovery_, (says a New York paper) has\r\narrived at Bordeaux, after an absence of three years and a half.\r\nThis ship has traversed the Pacific Ocean, and collected at the\r\nSandwich Islands, some interesting accounts of the fate of _La\r\nPeyrouse_ and his companions. A London paper states, that the\r\naccount will soon be published.\r\n\r\n  _Shawneetown, Illinois, Feb. 17._\r\n\r\n_Arrival from New York!_--The Steam Boat Manhattan, from New\r\nYork, arrived here this day, 30 days from New Orleans.

Both\r\ndistricts of country are admitted into the Union, as states; the\r\nformer, from its population, requiring no restriction of slavery;\r\nand the latter admitted on the same terms--4 majority in the house\r\nof representatives in favour of the bill as it has passed. The bill,\r\nhowever, excludes slavery from all the territory North of 36-1/2\r\ndeg. of N. latitude, Missouri excepted.\r\n\r\nFrom a respectable correspondent in Pauling, Duchess county, we\r\nhave the following singular case. Mr. Luther Brownwell of Beekman,\r\nin that county having, in the month of April 1815, a sow with a\r\nlitter of five pigs, and she dying when they were only two days\r\nold, he appropriated the milk of one of his new milch cows for\r\ntheir support. The cow was milked four or five times a day for this\r\npurpose, and the pigs were learned to drink the milk. When pasturing\r\ntime came, they were put in the field where the cow with nine others\r\nwas kept. At the age of two months, the pigs had the sagacity to\r\nsingle out this cow from the rest, and when hungry would come round\r\nher, root at her legs, squeak, and exhibit the usual signs of their\r\nwants. The cow at length learned to lay down, and let them suck what\r\nthey wanted. In this way they grew very rapidly until some time in\r\nSeptember, when they were put up to fatten, and were killed the\r\nNovember following. Their average weight was _240lbs._ or _1200lbs._\r\nof pork, which he sold for $8,50 a hundred.\r\n\r\nAside from the singularity of this case, the inquiry naturally\r\npresents itself, could the milk of the cow have been put to a more\r\nprofitable use? Is it not probable that her milk made an addition of\r\nat least _600lbs._ to the quantity of pork? [_Plough Boy._\r\n\r\nAn apprentices' library is about to be established in New York, on\r\nthe same plan as the one in this city and in Boston. The library in\r\nBoston consists of about 1000 volumes, principally of books on the\r\nmechanic arts, of history, travels, and other useful knowledge, and\r\non moral and religious subjects.\r\n\r\n_Steam Boats._--Among many interesting articles in the second number\r\nof the German Correspondent, published in New York, we find the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"The steam boat Blucher was lately launched at Potsdam. Several\r\nmembers of the royal family were present, and Prince Albseeth\r\nconferred the name. This is probably the largest steam boat in\r\nEurope, the whole length being 200 feet. It draws but 20-1/2\r\ninches of water. The boat contains _two_ engines, which perform\r\nexceedingly well. The utmost precaution is used against accidents by\r\nfire. As this vessel will carry merchandize of great value, and in\r\nlarge quantities, the hold has been divided into nine compartments\r\nby water proof partitions, so that, in case it should spring a leak,\r\nthere is every probability that the vessel would not fill--besides,\r\nby means of tubes there is a communication between these chambers\r\nand the locations of the engines, which are so arranged as to pump\r\nany quantity of water out of the divisions where the leak may exist.\r\nThis improvement appears to be well calculated for the steam boats\r\non the Mississippi.\"\r\n\r\n_Sagacity of a bear._--A bear which had stolen a sheep, being\r\nclosely persued by several dogs, promptly resorted to a most\r\ningenious expedient. He tore the sheep in pieces, and threw the\r\ndogs one of the hinder legs; and while they were partaking of this\r\nrepast, had full time to escape.\r\n\r\nThis fact is formally certified, by a game-keeper in Transylvania,\r\nwhere there are a great many bears. The most remarkable circumstance\r\nwas, that from that time the dogs would never attack any of these\r\nanimals, but on the contrary, received them in the most friendly\r\nmanner, as if they expected a dinner. The owner of the flock was\r\nobliged to have the dogs shot, that he might not have those hungry\r\nguests always about him. [_German Paper._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHENOMENON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the Literary Gazette._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\nI lately read an account of the figure, which, under some peculiar\r\nstate of the atmosphere, appears on the Hartz mountain, in Germany.\r\nIt reminds me of an extraordinary illusion to which I was once\r\nexposed; if it have interest enough for publication, it is at your\r\nservice. About seven years since, I was one evening, in the month of\r\nOctober, returning late from a friend's house in the country, where\r\nI had dined, to the neighbouring town, about a mile distant: the\r\nnight was exceedingly dark, and I had been requested to take with\r\nme a lantern; a pocket one could not be found, and I was provided\r\nwith that which the servants generally carried swung in the hand. I\r\nhad to pass through some fields over high ground: soon after I had\r\nentered the second of these, I observed something large moving along\r\nwith me. I placed the lantern on the ground, and walking toward it,\r\nsaw a gigantic figure retiring with astonishing speed. I immediately\r\nperceived it was my own shadow on a fog, which I had not before\r\nobserved. The appearance of retiring was phantasmagoric, and arose\r\nfrom my interruption of the rays of light from the lantern, at a\r\nlesser angle, as my distance from the light increased. My return\r\nto the light was terrific; the figure appeared to advance upon me\r\nwith frightful rapidity, till it seemed forty feet high. If I had\r\nbeen ignorant of the cause of this appearance, the effects might\r\nhave much alarmed me, and led to my telling such stories as I should\r\nnot have gained credit by relating: but aware of the cause, I was\r\ndelighted with the singularity of my situation; and might have\r\nbeen thought mad by an observer, for every fantastic attitude and\r\naction I could assume I did, to be mimicked by my new and shadowy\r\nacquaintance. I am, sir, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\nW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_English vegetables._--In the former part of the reign of king Henry\r\nVIII. there did not grow in England a cabbage, carrot, turnip, or\r\nother edible root--and even Queen Catherine could not command a\r\nsallad for dinner, till the king brought over a gardener from the\r\nNetherlands.--The artichoke, apricot, and damask rose, then made\r\ntheir first appearance in England.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coaches._--Coaches were introduced in 1585; before which time,\r\nQueen Elizabeth rode, on public occasions, behind her Lord\r\nChamberlain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ladies' Charity._--In the letters of Madame D. upon England, which\r\nhave just been published, we find the following passage, which shows\r\nhow little a woman used to the coteries of Paris can appreciate\r\nthe purest of our Christian charities.--\"The most elegant women\r\nin London have a certain day, upon which they go to a large room\r\nsurrounded with counters, at the end of Argyle Street; they go in\r\nperson, to sell, for the profit of the poor, the trifles, which they\r\namuse themselves in making during the course of the year. You may\r\nimagine that a young gentleman who pays his court to a young lady,\r\nis not permitted to hesitate at the price of the work of her fair\r\nhands. In fact, I saw several who were really foolishly extravagant,\r\nand the bank-notes were showered down on the counters of these\r\nladies.\r\n\r\n\"I observed in this assembly the prettiest young women I ever saw in\r\nmy life; all the men loiter delighted before her counter, and it was\r\nshe whose stock was the soonest disposed of.\r\n\r\nThe last man who stopped at it took a handful of bank-notes, and\r\nexchanged them for a watch-ribbon. I departed, enchanted with this\r\nscene.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chimnies._--In the age next preceding Queen Elizabeth, there were\r\nfew chimnies, even in capital towns: the fire was laid to the wall,\r\nand the smoke issued at the roof, or door, or window. The houses\r\nwere wattled, and plastered over with clay; and all the furniture\r\nand utensils were of wood. The people slept on straw pallets, with a\r\nlog of wood for a pillow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_The wisdom of Catwg_--The seven questions proposed by Catwg the\r\nwise to seven wise men in his college at Llanfeithin, with their\r\nanswers.\r\n\r\n\"1.

They are as\r\nblack as ebony, but the heart is firm wood, notwithstanding the\r\ntrees are believed to have been deposited for several thousand\r\nyears. The conjecture formed by those best qualified for considering\r\nthe subject of similar discoveries in other situations is, that they\r\nexisted before Noah's flood.\r\n\r\n_Nugæ Antiquæ._--From a household book of the Earl of Northumberland\r\nin the reign of Henry VIII. it appears, that his family, during\r\nwinter, fed mostly on salt fish and salt meat, and with that view\r\nthere was an appointment of 160 gallons of mustard. The Earl had two\r\ncooks, and more than 200 domestics.\r\n\r\nHolinshed says, that merchants, when they gave a feast, rejected\r\nbutchers' meat as unworthy of their table: having jellies of all\r\ncolours, and in all figures, representing flowers, trees, beasts,\r\nfish, fowl and fruit.\r\n\r\nThe streets of Paris, not being paved, was covered with mud; and yet\r\nfor a woman to travel those streets in a cart was held an article\r\nof luxury, and prohibited by Philip the Fair.\r\n\r\nAn old tenure in England binds the vassal to find straw for the\r\nKing's bed, and hay for his horse.\r\n\r\nIt was a luxurious change of wood platters for pewter plates, and\r\nfrom wooden spoons to those of tin.\r\n\r\nHolinshed says, \"when our houses were built of willow, then had we\r\noaken men? but now that our houses are made of oak, our men are not\r\nonly become willow but, many, through Persian delicacy, crept in\r\namong us, altogether of straw, which is a sore alteration.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reproof._--A person was remonstrating with a friend, inclined\r\ntoo much to dandyism, on the absurdity of following such foppish\r\nfashions. \"They are really contemptible, (said he,) and I am sure\r\nall who see you must think you ridiculous.\" \"I don't value the\r\nopinion of the world, (answered he,) I laugh at all those who think\r\nme ridiculous.\" \"Then you can never give over laughing,\" drily\r\nobserved his mentor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anecdote._--When the English Court interfered in favour of the\r\nprotestant subjects of Louis XIV. and requested his majesty to\r\nrelease some who had been sent to the gallies, the king asked\r\nangrily, \"What would the king of Great Britain say were I to demand\r\nthe prisoners of Newgate from him?\" Sir, (replied the ambassador,)\r\nmy master would give every one of them up to your majesty, if, as we\r\ndo, _you reclaim them as brothers_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you think this little anecdote worth a place in the _Rural\r\nMagazine_, you may be assured of its authenticity.\r\n\r\nA. B.\r\n\r\n  \"A guilty conscience needs no accuser.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA singular instance of the truth of this saying occurred a few days\r\nago, in Market Street. A sharper, under pretence of buying some\r\nsmall article in a store, managed to take from a countryman present,\r\nhis pocket book, and having secured, as he supposed, his booty,\r\npaid his little bill and retired. The honest storekeeper discovering\r\nhe had given him too little change, immediately went to the door and\r\ncalled him to stop. The fellow supposing himself detected, took, to\r\nhis heels. The croud in the street observing the circumstances cried\r\nstop thief! stop thief! He was soon overtaken and brought back, when\r\nthe pocket book, which had not been missed by the owner, was found\r\non him, and he taken before the proper authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommunicated for the Rural Magazine.\r\n\r\n_A Newly discovered, cheap and durable Paint._\r\n\r\n\r\nI send you for publication in the Rural Magazine, a receipt for a\r\nnewly discovered paint, it is cheap and will no doubt be useful to\r\nsome of your readers.\r\n\r\nD.\r\n\r\nTo a common 3 gallon pail of whitewash, add 1 pint of cheap\r\nmolasses and 1 pint of white table salt. The best store lime\r\nshould be selected and boiling water used in slaking it. It should\r\nbe frequently stirred as you put it on. Two thin coats will be\r\nsufficient to cover the weatherboards of out-buildings. It will not\r\nwash or scale off like common whitewash and is beautifully white.\r\nFor other colours mix ochres of various kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Air Jacket._--Mr. Charles Kendal lately made an experiment on the\r\nThames, of the efficacy of his jacket, or Life-preserver, which\r\ncompletely succeeded. He went from the southwark Bridge through\r\nLondon Bridge with great ease and on to the London Docks in 20\r\nminutes, walking upright in the water accompanied by his man all the\r\nway.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A new and cheap conductor of lightning and fluid._--Mr. Capostolle,\r\nProfessor of Chemistry in the departments of the Somme, affirms\r\nthat a rope of straw supplies the place of the expensive metal\r\nconductors. The experiments, which he has made in the presence of\r\nmany learned men and which have been repeated by them, confirms as\r\nhe says that the lightning enters a rope of straw placed in its\r\nway and passes through it into the ground so gently that the hand\r\nof a person holding the rope at the time does not perceive it. Mr.\r\nCapostolle brings the following proof of this assertion. It is\r\nwell known says he that a severe shock is received by a person who\r\nimmediately touches the Leyden vial. But if a person takes a rope of\r\nstraw, only seven or eight inches long, in his hand, and touches,\r\nwith the end of this rope a Leyden vial, so strongly charged that\r\nan ox might be killed by it, he will neither see a spark, or feel\r\nthe slightest shock. According to Mr. Capostolle's opinion, such\r\nconductor made of straw, which would not cost alone three francs,\r\nwould be able to protect an extent of sixty acres of ground from\r\nhail; and if the houses and fields were protected in this manner,\r\nneither hail nor lightning could do any damage to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Economy of Nature._--In the sunshine vegetables decompose the\r\n_carbonic acid gas_ of the atmosphere, the _carbon_ of which is\r\nabsorbed, and becomes a part of their organized matter, but the\r\n_oxygen gas_, the other constituent is given off; thus the economy\r\nof vegetation is made subservient to the general order of the system\r\nof nature. Again, _Carbonic acid gas_ is formed in the respiration\r\nof animals, and as yet no process is known in nature by which it can\r\nbe consumed, except vegetation. Animals thus produce a substance\r\nwhich appears to be a necessary food for vegetables;--vegetables\r\nevolve a principle necessary to the existence of animals: the two\r\nkingdoms seem to be thus connected together in the exercise of their\r\nfunctions, and, to a certain extent, made to depend upon each other\r\nfor their existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Legible Writing._--The Grand Duke of Baden has issued an ordinance,\r\nenjoining all public functionaries in his dominions, who sign their\r\nnames in an illegible manner, through _affectation_, to write them\r\nin future so that they can be read, under the pain of having any\r\ndocument illegibly signed, thrown back on their hands.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Samuel Chandler was boring for salt near Zanesville,\r\nOhio, he found a metallic substance six feet three inches thick,\r\nwhich being analysed, was found to be silver, nearly as pure as\r\nthe common coin. This singular account is attested in the National\r\nIntelligencer by a member of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Square Mile._--It may be thought wonderful that the whole\r\npopulation of this country could stand on considerably less than\r\na square mile. Allowing six men to a square yard, the mile would\r\naccommodate _eighteen millions five hundred and eighty five thousand\r\nsix hundred men!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Latitude of Trees in Sweden._--From the researches made in Sweden\r\non the different kinds of wood indigenous to the country, it has\r\nbeen ascertained that the birch reaches the farthest north, growing\r\nbeyond the 70th degree; the pine reaches to the 69th; the fir tree\r\nto the 68th; the ozier, willow, aspen and quince, to the 66th; the\r\ncherry and apple tree to the 63d; the oak to the 60th; and the beech\r\nto the 57th; while the lime tree, ash, elm, poplar and walnut, are\r\nonly to be found in Scavia.\r\n\r\n  [_Lond. Journ. of Science._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Singular Anecdote of the Spider, by Capt. Bagnold._--Desirous of\r\nascertaining the natural food of the scorpion, I enclosed one (which\r\nmeasured three fourths of an inch from the head to the insertion\r\nof the tail) in a wide mouthed phial, together with one of those\r\nlarge spiders so common in the West Indies, and closed it with a\r\ncork, perforated by a quill, for the admission of air: the insects\r\nseemed carefully to avoid each other, retiring to opposite ends of\r\nthe bottle, which was placed horizontally. By giving it a gradual\r\ninclination, the scorpion was forced into contact with the spider,\r\nwhen a sharp encounter took place, the latter receiving repeated\r\nstings from his venomous adversary, apparently without the least\r\ninjury, and with his web, soon lashed the scorpion's tail to his\r\nback, subsequently securing his legs and claws with the materials.\r\nIn this state I left them some time, in order to observe what effect\r\nwould be produced on the spider by the wounds he had received. On\r\nmy return, however, I was disappointed, the ants having entered and\r\ndestroyed them both.\r\n\r\n  [_Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spontaneous Combustion._--_From the Baltimore Morning\r\nChronicle._--At my mills there was an iron kettle used for holding\r\nashes--it had remained with ashes in from the 5th to the 9th month\r\nat which time flaxseed oil was by accident spilled into the ashes;\r\nin about 24 hours the ashes were found to be on fire, and wishing to\r\nhave it fully ascertained, whether it was the oil which occasioned\r\nthe ashes to take fire, I filled a kettle with cold dry ashes, in\r\nwhich I poured a pint of flaxseed oil, and in 24 hours I examined\r\nit, and found that, as far as the oil had penetrated the ashes were\r\nin a state of combustion, and, applying some shavings and chips of\r\nwood, it immediately caused them to blaze.\r\n\r\nFrom an apprehension that many buildings have been consumed by fires\r\nfrom the foregoing cause, I have been induced to give publicity to\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\nJOSEPH ATKINSON.\r\n\r\n  _Ellicot Patapsco Mills_, }\r\n         _1 mo. 22d. 1820._ }\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spontaneous Combustion._--SIR I observe, in your paper of yesterday\r\nthat your correspondent _Davyana_ has made an _unsuccessful_\r\nexperiment, to verify the account given by Mr. Atkinson of a\r\n_Spontaneous Combustion_, produced some time ago, at his mills near\r\nBaltimore, by the accidental mixture of linseed oil and wood ashes.\r\n\r\nAn experiment has also been made, with a similar view, at the _Mint_\r\nof the United States. The ashes employed were chiefly from hickery\r\nwood, well sifted, and cold; and the quantity of linseed oil, one\r\npint. No change of temperature was perceived, till about 46 hours\r\nafter the oil had been poured on the ashes, when the mixture was\r\nfairly ignited, and in a short time emitted flame, which continued\r\nupwards of an hour. After the flame had ceased, the ignition\r\ncontinued for about 18 hours, and the ashes were then poured out of\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\nR. P.\r\n\r\n  [_Poulson's Am. Daily Adv._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gas lights._--The number of gas lights already in use in the\r\nmetropolis of London amounts to upwards of 51,000. The total length\r\nof mains in the streets through which the gas is conveyed from the\r\ngas light manufactories into the houses now measure 288 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Seed Potatoes._--It has been recently ascertained from the most\r\ndecisive experiments, that late potatoes, or such as are not ripe,\r\nwere the best seed, and that planting such restores a degenerated\r\nvariety to its original qualities. The discoverer of this fact\r\nrecommends the planting of seed from cold and late situations,\r\nand to plant so late as June and July, taking up those unripe,\r\nand preserving them as seed for the following year.\r\n\r\n[_Vermont Intelligencer._.\r\n\r\n\r\n_London._--The consumption of sheep and lambs in London, during the\r\nlast twelve months, amounted in number to one million, sixty-two\r\nthousand, seven hundred. The number of horned cattle slaughtered,\r\nwas one hundred and sixty-four thousand--and by the inspector's\r\nreturn, it appears, that the number of horse hides produced at\r\nLeadenhall market, amounted to twelve thousand nine hundred.\r\n\r\n\r\nBORING _legalized_.--Last week we mentioned that a silver mine was\r\nsaid to have been discovered near Zanesville, in Ohio. By the last\r\nColumbus papers we are informed that the bill incorporating the\r\n\"Muskingum Silver Mining Company\" has passed the legislature.\r\n\r\nIt is said that the rock about twenty feet below the surface of\r\nthe earth, extends under nearly the whole territory of Ohio; that\r\nthe silver was found after penetrating the rock about 100 feet;\r\nand that, therefore, there is an even chance that this stratum of\r\nsilver, near 7 feet in thickness, is as extensive as the state.\r\n\r\nVerily, should this prove to be the case, what an alteration would\r\nit make in our affairs! Neighbouring states would supply Ohio\r\nwith corn and whiskey--her keen speculators would become lazy\r\nnabobs--Yankee pedlars might venture to drive their trade there,\r\nwithout danger of being _bitten_--her rag banks, notwithstanding\r\nall that has been said to the contrary, would prove to have had at\r\nall times, a _specie foundation_: and Owl Creek and Cincinnati bank\r\nnotes command a premium over eastern funds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCapt. SYMMES has long expressed great anxiety _to get into the\r\nearth_, and, as it is a long journey to the north pole, (where there\r\nis certainly a hole big enough for Capt. Symmes to get in) and\r\nthe Captain says he cannot undertake the journey for the want of\r\n\"disposable means,\"--now, therefore, this may be entirely a manoevre\r\nof the captain's, or of his friends, to get a cheap passage into\r\nthe earth, whereby he may embark near home, and without expense\r\nin the outfit. At any rate, we hope the company will persevere in\r\n_boring_--it is a good subject--for should they either find silver\r\nor provide a passage for Capt. Symmes, they will silence the hungry\r\ncomplaints of many speculators--both in real estate and in the\r\nlearned and fashionable _ologies_ of the day.

The thermometer at\r\nSt. Petersburg, stood at 35-1/2 below Zero.\r\n\r\nThe frost has been severe in France and England. At Paris on the\r\n11th, the thermometer of the engineer Chevalier, stood at 11 below\r\n0. The Seine was frozen over.\r\n\r\nPetitions are getting up in Ireland, in favour of a dissolution of\r\nthe union with Great Britain!\r\n\r\nIt had been colder in the month of January in England, than was ever\r\nknown before in that country. In the city of London the thermometer\r\nstood twenty-three degrees below the freezing point.

MARCH 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Accident._--On Thursday last, the chain bridge over Dunlap's creek,\r\nbetween Brownsville and Bridgeport broke down with a wagon and\r\nsix horses upon it. The wagon fell on the bank, this side of the\r\nstream, the horses in the water. The driver, who was on the saddle\r\nhorse, was pitched between the two middle horses, where he was held\r\nentangled in the gears, until relieved by the citizens. He received\r\nno material injury, but two of the horses were killed. The team,\r\nwe understand, was the property of a person named Hackney, near\r\nWinchester, (Va.) The distance from the floor of this bridge to the\r\nsurface of the water, must have been at least 30 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leeches._--The Montrose (English) Review of January 1st, states\r\nthat a gentleman examining two bottles containing 3 leeches each,\r\nfound the water a complete mass of ice, with the leeches frozen.

Barclay &. Co. is\r\none of the most considerable. A steam engine, of the power of 30\r\nhorses, does the greatest part of the work; for although there are\r\nnearly two hundred men employed, and a great number of horses,\r\nthese are mostly for the out-door work; the interior appears quite\r\nsolitary. Large rakes with chains moved by an invisible power,\r\nstir to the very bottom the immense mass of malt in boilers 12\r\nfeet deep; elevators which nobody touches, carry up to the summit\r\nof the building 2500 bushels of malt a day, thence distributed\r\nthrough wooden channels to the different places where the process\r\nis carried on.--Casks of truly gigantic sizes are ready to receive\r\nthe liquors. One of them contains 3000 barrels. Now, at 8 barrels\r\nto a ton, this is equal to a ship of 375 tons. By the side of this\r\nare other enormous vessels, the smallest of which, containing about\r\n800 barrels, are worth when full 3000 pounds sterling each. All this\r\nimmense apparatus is so arranged that every part is accessible,\r\nand the whole is contained under one roof. The stock of liquor\r\nis estimated at 300,000 pounds; the barrels alone in which it is\r\ncarried about to customers cost 80,000 pounds; and the whole capital\r\nis not less than half a million sterling; 250,000 barrels of beer\r\nare sold annually, which would load a fleet of 150 merchantmen, of\r\nthe burden of 200 tons each.

Belzoni_, that he has recently performed a journey\r\ninto the deserts of Lybia, to examine there the environs and ruins\r\nof the temple Jupiter Ammon. This journey lasted 50 days, during\r\nwhich time he saw different ruins, several temples and other\r\nremarkable objects. After having traversed the desert, he arrived at\r\nthe place where the temple is supposed to have existed. The country\r\nwas fertile, and he found some villages, but the inhabitants of\r\nthe country, where, perhaps, for several centuries a European had\r\nnot been seen, were very savage, and would not suffer him to pass,\r\nbecause they imagined that he was looking for treasures in their\r\ncountry. The ruins of the temple he discovered had been employed\r\nin the construction of another temple, which is already in part\r\ndestroyed, and in forming the foundation of the cabins of a village.\r\nThe most remarkable thing, however, discovered by _M. Belzoni_ in\r\nthose environs is a spring of living water, of which _Herodotus_\r\nmakes mention, warm in the morning and evening, cold at noon, and\r\nboiling hot at midnight. _M. Belzoni_ has brought away some of this\r\nwater for the purpose of analysing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Hint to Smokers._--The city of New York, is said to contain\r\n130,000 inhabitants. Let 50,000 of them smoke only three Spanish\r\nsegars a day, and it will amount in the year to the enormous sum of\r\n$1,095,000; a sum sufficient to pay the salary of the President and\r\nVice-President of the United States, the Secretaries of State, of\r\nthe Treasury, of war, and of the Navy, and of the Attorney, General,\r\nfor 20 years, 10 months, and 8 days.\r\n\r\n  [_N.

It is well known,\r\nthat in this branch of our humble duties, the greatest difficulty\r\narises from our poultry houses being so much infested with _vermin_;\r\nor, to be more plain, in the slang of the poultry yard, with\r\n_chicken lice_. Now, I have proved, by long experience, that they\r\nwill not resort to houses wherein the roots, nest boxes, &c. &c. are\r\nmade of _sassafras wood_. You may smile, and ask me, the _reason\r\nof it_: I am no philosopher, but I tell you, _sassafras wood_ will\r\nkeep lice out of hen houses: I know it to be a fact, and when you\r\nwill tell me _why it is_ that chips of cedar wood or tobacco will\r\nkeep woollen free from _moth_, then I will endeavour to tell you\r\n_why_ it is, that sassafras wood will keep away chicken lice--one is\r\nuniversally known to be true, the other no less true, though less\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n  A SPINSTER.

This kind of request is sometimes very\r\ndifficult for an editor to comply with. In the present instance, we\r\nfeel much obliged to our correspondent for his intention of serving\r\nus, and did we know him personally, would give him our reasons for\r\nomitting his pieces.\r\n\r\nWe have anticipated the request of \"AGRICOLA\" of Susquehannah\r\ncounty, by inserting in our last number the address of _Judge\r\nTilghman_. \"AGRICOLA's\" remarks upon, and large quotations from it,\r\ncould not with so much propriety be now admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHILADELPHIA,\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED MONTHLY BY\r\n\r\nRICHARDS & CALEB JOHNSON,\r\n\r\n_No. 31, Market Street_,\r\n\r\nAt $3.00 per annum.\r\n\r\nGriggs & Dickinson--_Printers_, _Whitehall_.",
