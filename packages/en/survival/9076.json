In 1879 the first conference of what was termed the\r\nInternational Polar Congress was held at Hamburg. Delegates from eight\r\nnations were present--Germany, Austria, Denmark, France, Holland,\r\nNorway, Russia, and Sweden.\r\n\r\nThe congress then settled upon a programme whose features were: 1. To\r\nestablish general principles and fixed laws in regard to the pressure\r\nof the atmosphere, the distribution and variation of temperature,\r\natmospheric currents, climatic characteristics. 2. To assist the\r\nprediction of the course and occurrence of storms. 3. To assist the\r\nstudy of the disturbances of the magnetic elements and their relations\r\nto the auroral light and sun spots. 4. To study the distribution of\r\nthe magnetic force and its secular and other changes. 5. To study the\r\ndistribution of heat and submarine currents in the polar regions. 6. To\r\nobtain certain dimensions in accord with recent methods. Finally, to\r\ncollect observations and specimens in the domain of zoology, botany,\r\ngeology, etc.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the various nations had several conferences\r\nlater, and by the 1st of May, 1881, there were sufficient subscribers to\r\njustify the establishment of eight Arctic stations.\r\n\r\nFrance entered actively in this work later, and its first expedition was\r\nto Orange Bay and Cape Horn, under the surveillance and direction of\r\nthe Academy of Sciences, Paris, and responsible to the Secretary of the\r\nNavy. On the 6th of September, 1882, this scientific corps established\r\nitself in Orange Bay, near Cape Horn, and energetically began its\r\nserious labors, and by October 22 the greater part of their preliminary\r\npreparations was completed, comprising the erection of a magnetic\r\nobservatory, an astronomic observatory, a room for the determination of\r\nthe carbonic anhydride of the air, another for the sea register, and\r\na bridge 92 feet long, photographic laboratory, barometer room, and\r\nbuildings for the men, food, and appurtenances, together with a\r\nlaboratory of natural history.\r\n\r\nIn short, in spite of persistent rains and the difficulties of the\r\nsituation, from September 8 to October 22 they erected an establishment\r\nof which the different parts, fastened, as it were, to the flank of a\r\nsteep hill, covered 450 square meters (4,823 square feet), and rested\r\nupon 200 wooden piles.\r\n\r\nFrom September 26, 1882, to September 1, 1883, night and day\r\nuninterruptedly, a watch was kept, in which the officers took part, so\r\nthat the observations might be regularly made and recorded. Every four\r\nhours a series of direct magnetic and meteorological observations was\r\nmade, from hour to hour meteorological notes were taken, the rise and\r\nfall of the sea recorded, and these were frequently multiplied by\r\nobservations every quarter of an hour; the longitude and latitude were\r\nexactly determined, a number of additions to the catalogue of the fixed\r\nstars for the southern heavens made, and numerous specimens in natural\r\nhistory collected.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus employed by the expedition for the registration of the\r\nmagnetic elements was devised by M. Mascart, by which the variations\r\nof the three elements are inscribed upon a sheet of paper covered with\r\ngelatine bromide, inclination, vertical and horizontal components, with\r\na certainty which is shown by the 330 diurnal curves brought back from\r\nthe Cape.\r\n\r\nThe register proper is composed of a clock and a photographic frame\r\nwhich descends its entire length in twenty-four hours, thus causing the\r\nsensitized paper to pass behind a horizontal window upon which falls the\r\nlight reflected by the mirrors of the magnetic instruments. One of those\r\nmirrors is fixed, and gives a line of reference; the other is attached\r\nto the magnetic bar, whose slightest movements it reproduces upon the\r\nsensitized paper. The moments when direct observations were taken were\r\ncarefully recorded. The magnetic _pavilion_ was made of wood and copper,\r\nplaced at about fifty-three feet from the dwellings or camp, near the\r\nsea, against a wooded hill which shaded it completely; the interior\r\nwas covered with felt upon all its sides, in order to avoid as much as\r\npossible the varying temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe diurnal amplitude of the declination increased uniformly from the\r\ntime of their arrival in September up to December, when it obtained\r\nits maximum of 7'40\", then diminished to June, when it is no more than\r\n2'20\"; from this it increased up to the day of departure. The maximum\r\ndeclination takes place toward 1 P.M., the minimum at 8:50 A.M. The\r\nnight maxima and minima are not clearly shown except in the southern\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe mean diurnal curve brings into prominence the constant diminution\r\nof the declination and the much greater importance of the perturbations\r\nduring the summer months. These means, combined with the 300 absolute\r\ndeterminations, give 4' as the annual change of the declination.\r\n\r\nM. Mascart's apparatus proved to be wonderfully useful in recording the\r\nrapid and slight perturbations of the magnet. Comparisons between the\r\nmagnetic and atmospheric perturbations gave no result. There was,\r\nhowever, little stormy weather and no auroral displays. This latter\r\nphenomenon, according to the English missionaries, is rarely observed in\r\nTierra del Fuego.\r\n\r\nThe electrometer used at the Cape was founded upon the principle\r\ndeveloped by Sir William Thomson. The atmospheric electricity is\r\ngathered up by means of a thin thread of water, which flows from a\r\nlarge brass reservoir furnished with a metallic tube 6.5 feet long. The\r\nreservoir is placed upon glass supports isolated by sulphuric acid, and\r\nis connected to the electrometer by a thread of metal which enters a\r\nglass vessel containing sulphuric acid; into the same vessel enters a\r\nplatinum wire coming from the aluminum needle. Only 3,000 observations\r\nwere given by the photographic register, due to the fact that the\r\ninstruments were not fully protected against constant wet and cold.\r\n\r\nBesides these observations direct observations of the magnetometer were\r\nmade, and the absolute determination of the elements of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism attempted.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of November, 1882, a severe magnetic disturbance occurred,\r\nlasting from 12 M. until 3 P.M., which in three hours changed the\r\ndeclination 42'. The same perturbation was felt in Europe, and the\r\ncomparison of the observations in the two hemispheres will prove\r\ninstructive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ELECTRIC RAILWAY AT VIENNA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total length of this railway, which extended from the Eiskeller in\r\nthe Schwimmschul-Allee to the northern entrance of the Rotunda, was\r\n1528.3 meters; the gauge was 1 meter, and 60 per cent. of the length\r\nconsisted of tangents, the remaining 40 per cent. being mostly curves\r\nof 250 meters radius. The gradients, three in number, were very small,\r\naveraging about 1:750.\r\n\r\nTwo generating dynamos were used, which were coupled in parallel\r\ncircuit, but in such a manner that the difference of potential in both\r\nmachines remained the same at all times. This was accomplished by the\r\nwell known method of coupling introduced by Siemens and Halske, in which\r\nthe current of one machine excites the field of the other.\r\n\r\nAlthough the railroad was not built with a view of obtaining a high\r\nefficiency, an electro-motive force of only 150 volts being used, a\r\nmechanical efficiency of 50 per cent. was nevertheless obtained, both\r\nwith one generator and one car with thirty passengers, as well as with\r\ntwo generators and two cars with sixty passengers; while with two\r\ngenerators and three cars (two of them having motors) the same result\r\nwas shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ELECTRIC RAILWAY AT VIENNA.]\r\n\r\nThe curves obtained by the apparatus that recorded the current showed\r\nvery plainly the action within the machines when the cars were started\r\nor set in motion; at first, the current rose rapidly to a very high\r\nfigure, and then declined gradually to a fixed point, which corresponded\r\nto the regular rate of speed. The tractive power, therefore, increases\r\nrapidly to a value far exceeding the frictional resistances, but this\r\nsurplus energy serves to increase the velocity, and disappears as soon\r\nas a uniform velocity is reached.\r\n\r\nThe average speed, both with one and three cars, was 30 kilometers per\r\nhour.--_Zeitsch. f.

THURSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer has often been asked by correspondents interested in\r\nthe matter of technical and trade education to outline a course of\r\ninstruction in mechanical engineering, such as would represent his\r\nidea of a tolerably complete system of preparation for entrance into\r\npractice. The synopsis given at the end of this article was prepared\r\nin the spring of 1871, when the writer was on duty at the U.S. Naval\r\nAcademy, as Assistant Professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy,\r\nand, being printed, was submitted to nearly all of the then leading\r\nmechanical engineers of the United States, for criticism, and with a\r\nrequest that they would suggest such alterations and improvements as\r\nmight seem to them best. The result was general approval of the course,\r\nsubstantially as here written. This outline was soon after proposed as a\r\nbasis for the course of instruction adopted at the Stevens Institute of\r\nTechnology, at Hoboken, to which institution the writer was at about\r\nthat time called. He takes pleasure in accepting a suggestion that its\r\npublication in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN would be of some advantage to\r\nmany who are interested in the subject.\r\n\r\nThe course here sketched, as will be evident on examination, includes\r\nnot only the usual preparatory studies pursued in schools of mechanical\r\nengineering, but also advanced courses, such as can only be taught in\r\nspecial schools, and only there when an unusual amount of time can be\r\ngiven to the professional branches, or when post graduate courses can be\r\ngiven supplementary to the general course. The complete course, as here\r\nplanned, is not taught in any existing school, so far as the writer is\r\naware. In his own lecture room the principal subjects, and especially\r\nthose of the first part of the work, are presented with tolerable\r\nthoroughness; but many of the less essential portions are necessarily\r\ngreatly abridged. As time can be found for the extension of the course,\r\nand as students come forward better prepared for their work, the earlier\r\npart of the subject is more and more completely developed, and the\r\nadvanced portions are taken up in greater and greater detail, each year\r\ngiving opportunity to advance beyond the limits set during the preceding\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nSome parts of this scheme are evidently introductory to advanced courses\r\nof study which are to be taken up by specialists, each one being adapted\r\nto the special instruction of a class of students who, while pursuing\r\nit, do not usually take up the other and parallel courses. Thus, a\r\ncourse of instruction in Railroad Engineering, a course in Marine\r\nEngineering, or a course of study in the engineering of textile\r\nmanufactures, may be arranged to follow the general course, and the\r\nstudent will enter upon one or another of these advanced courses as his\r\ntalents, interests, or personal inclinations may dictate. At the Stevens\r\nInstitute of Technology, two such courses--Electrical and Marine\r\nEngineering--are now organized as supplementary of the general course,\r\nand are pursued by all students taking the degree of Mechanical\r\nEngineer. These courses, as there given, however, are not fairly\r\nrepresentative of the idea of the writer, as above expressed, since the\r\ntime available in general course is far too limited to permit them to be\r\ndeveloped beyond the elements, or to be made, in the true sense of the\r\nterm, advanced professional courses. Such advanced courses as the writer\r\nhas proposed must be far more extended, and should occupy the whole\r\nattention of the student for the time. Such courses should be given in\r\nseparate departments under the direction of a General Director of the\r\nprofessional courses, who should be competent to determine the extent of\r\neach, and to prevent the encroachment of the one upon another; but they\r\nshould each be under the immediate charge of a specialist capable\r\nof giving instruction in the branch assigned to him, in both the\r\ntheoretical and purely scientific, and the practical and constructive\r\nsides of the work. Every such school should be organized in such a\r\nmanner that one mind, familiar with the theory and the practice of the\r\nprofessional branches taught, should be charged with the duty of giving\r\ngeneral direction to the policy of the institution and of directing\r\nthe several lines of work confided to specialists in the different\r\ndepartments. It is only by careful and complete organization in this, as\r\nin every business, that the best work can be done at least expense in\r\ntime and capital.\r\n\r\nIn this course of instruction in Mechanical Engineering it will be\r\nobserved that the writer has incorporated the scheme of a workshop\r\ncourse. This is done, not at all with the idea that a school of\r\nmechanical engineering is to be regarded as a \"trade school,\" but that\r\nevery engineer should have some acquaintance with the tools and the\r\nmethods of work upon which the success of his own work is so largely\r\ndependent. If the mechanical engineer can acquire such knowledge in the\r\nmore complete course of instruction of the trade school, either before\r\nor after his attendance at the technical school, it will be greatly to\r\nhis advantage. The technical school has, however, a distinct field; and\r\nits province is not to be confounded with that of the trade school.\r\nThe former is devoted to instruction in the theory and practice of a\r\nprofession which calls for service upon the men from the latter--which\r\nmakes demand upon a hundred trades--in the prosecution of its designs.\r\nThe latter teaches, simply, the practical methods of either of the\r\ntrades subsidiary to the several branches of engineering, with only so\r\nmuch of science as is essential to the intelligent use of the tools and\r\nthe successful application of the methods of work of the trade taught.\r\nThe distinction between the two departments of education, both of which\r\nare of comparatively modern date, is not always appreciated in the\r\nUnited States, although always observed in those countries of Europe\r\nin which technical and trade education have been longest pursued as\r\nessential branches of popular instruction. Throughout France and\r\nGermany, every large town has its trade schools, in which the trades\r\nmost generally pursued in the place are systematically taught; and every\r\nlarge city has its technical school, in which the several professions\r\nallied to engineering are studied with special development of those to\r\nwhich the conditions prevailing at the place give most prominence and\r\nlocal importance.\r\n\r\nA course of trade instruction, as the writer would organize it, would\r\nconsist, first, in the teaching of the apprentice the use of the tools\r\nof his trade, the nature of its materials, and the construction and\r\noperation of the machinery employed in its prosecution. He would next be\r\ntaught how to shape the simpler geometrical forms in the materials of\r\nhis trade, getting out a straight prism, a cylinder, a pyramid, or a\r\nsphere, of such size and form as may be convenient; getting lines and\r\nplanes at right angles, or working to miter; practicing the working of\r\nhis \"job\" to definite size, and to the forms given by drawings, which\r\ndrawings should be made by the apprentice himself. When he is able to\r\ndo good work of this kind, he should attempt larger work, and the\r\nconstruction of parts of structures involving exact fitting and special\r\nmanipulations. The course, finally, should conclude with exercises in\r\nthe construction and erection of complete structures and in the making\r\nof peculiar details, such as are regarded by the average workman\r\nas remarkable \"_tours de force_.\" The trade school usually gives\r\ninstruction in the common school branches of education, and especially\r\nin drawing, free-hand and mechanical, carrying them as far as the\r\nsuccessful prosecution of the trade requires. The higher mathematics,\r\nand advanced courses in physics and chemistry, always taught in schools\r\nof engineering, are not taught in the trade school, as a rule; although\r\nintroduced into those larger schools of this class in which the aim is\r\nto train managers and proprietors, as well as workmen. This is done in\r\nmany European schools.\r\n\r\nAs is seen above, the course of instruction in mechanical engineering\r\nincludes some trade education. The engineer is dependent upon the\r\nmachinist, the founder, the patternmaker, and other workers at the\r\ntrades, for the proper construction of the machinery and structures\r\ndesigned by him. He is himself, in so far as he is an engineer, a\r\ndesigner of constructions, not a constructor. He often combines,\r\nhowever, the functions of the engineer, the builder, the manufacturer,\r\nand the dealer, in his own person. No man can carry on, successfully,\r\nany business in which he is not at home in every detail, and in which he\r\ncannot instruct every subordinate, and cannot show every person employed\r\nby him precisely what is wanted, and how the desired result can be best\r\nattained. The engineer must, therefore, learn, as soon and as thoroughly\r\nas possible, enough of the details of every art and trade, subsidiary\r\nto his own department of engineering, to enable him to direct, with\r\nintelligence and confidence, every operation that contributes to the\r\nsuccess of his work. The school of engineering should therefore be so\r\norganized that the young engineer may be taught the elements of every\r\ntrade which is likely to find important application in his professional\r\nwork. It cannot be expected that time can be given him to make himself\r\nan expert workman, or to acquire the special knowledge of details and\r\nthe thousand and one useful devices which are an important part of the\r\nstock in trade of the skilled workman; but he may very quickly learn\r\nenough to facilitate his own work greatly, and to enable him to learn\r\nstill more, with rapidity and ease, during his later professional life.\r\nHe must also, usually, learn the essential elements and principles of\r\neach of several trades, and must study their relations to his work, and\r\nthe limitations of his methods of design and construction which they\r\nalways, to a greater or less extent, cause by their own practical or\r\neconomical limitations. He will find that his designs, his methods of\r\nconstruction, and of fitting up and erecting, must always be planned\r\nwith an intelligent regard to the exigencies of the shop, as well as to\r\nthe aspect of the commercial side of every operation. This extension of\r\ntrade education for the engineer into several trades, instead of its\r\nrestriction to a single trade, as is the case in the regular trade\r\nschool, still further limits the range of his instruction in each. With\r\nunusual talent for manipulation, he may acquire considerable knowledge\r\nof all the subsidiary trades in a wonderfully short space of time, if he\r\nis carefully handled by his instructors, who must evidently be experts,\r\neach in his own trade. Even the average man who goes into such schools,\r\nfollowing his natural bent, may do well in the shop course, under good\r\narrangements as to time and character of instruction. If a man has not a\r\nnatural inclination for the business, and a natural aptitude for it, he\r\nwill make a great mistake if he goes into such a school with the hope of\r\ndoing creditable work, or of later attaining any desirable position in\r\nthe profession.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction, at the Stevens Institute of Technology,\r\nincludes instruction in the trades to the extent above indicated. The\r\noriginal plan, as given below, included such a course of trade education\r\nfor the engineer; but it was not at once introduced. The funds\r\navailable from an endowment fund crippled by the levying of an enormous\r\n\"succession tax\" by the United States government and by the cost of\r\nneeded apparatus and of unanticipated expenses, in buildings and in\r\norganization, were insufficient to permit the complete organization\r\nof this department. A few tools were gathered together; but skilled\r\nmechanics could not be employed to take up the work of instruction in\r\nthe several courses. Little could therefore be done for several years in\r\nthis direction. In 1875 the writer organized a \"mechanical laboratory,\"\r\nwith the purpose of attaining several very important objects: the\r\nprosecution of scientific research in the various departments of\r\nengineering work; the creation of an organization that should give\r\nstudents an opportunity to learn the methods of research most usefully\r\nemployed in such investigations; the assistance of members of the\r\nprofession, and business organizations in the attempt to solve such\r\nquestions, involving scientific research, as are continually arising in\r\nthe course of business; the employment of students who had done\r\ngood work in their college course, when they so desire, in work of\r\ninvestigation with a view to giving them such knowledge of this peculiar\r\nline of work as should make them capable of directing such operations\r\nelsewhere; and finally, but not least important of all, to secure, by\r\nearning money in commercial work of this kind, the funds needed to carry\r\non those departments of the course in engineering that had been, up\r\nto that time, less thoroughly organized than seemed desirable. This\r\n\"laboratory\" was organized in 1875, the funds needed being obtained\r\nby drawing upon loans offered by friends of the movement and by the\r\n\"Director.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until the year 1878, therefore, that it became possible to\r\nattempt the organization of the shop course; and it was then only by the\r\nwriter assuming personal responsibility for its expenses that the plan\r\ncould be entered upon. As then organized--in the autumn of 1878--a\r\nsuperintendent of the workshop had general direction of the trade\r\ndepartment of the school. He was instructed to submit to the writer\r\nplans, in detail, for a regular course of shop instruction, and was\r\ngiven as assistants a skilled mechanic of unusual experience and\r\nability, whose compensation was paid from the mechanical laboratory\r\nfunds, and guaranteed by the writer personally, and another aid whose\r\nservices were paid for partly by the Institute and partly as above. The\r\npay of the superintendent was similarly assured. This scheme had been\r\nbarely entered upon when the illness of the writer compelled him to\r\ntemporarily give up his work, and the direction of the new organization\r\nfell into other hands, although the department was carried on, as above,\r\nfor a year or more after this event occurred.\r\n\r\nThe plan did not fall through; the course of instruction was\r\nincorporated into the college course, and its success was finally\r\nassured by the growth of the school and a corresponding growth of its\r\nincome, and, especially, by the liberality of President Morton, who met\r\nexpenses to the amount of many thousands of dollars by drawing upon his\r\nown bank account. The department was by him completely organized, with\r\nan energetic head, and needed support was given in funds and by a force\r\nof skilled instructors. This school is now in successful operation.\r\nThis course now also includes the systematic instruction of students in\r\nexperimental work, and the objects sought by the writer in the creation\r\nof a \"mechanical laboratory\" are thus more fully attained than they\r\ncould have possibly been otherwise. It is to be hoped that, at\r\nsome future time, when the splendid bequest of Mr. Stevens may be\r\nsupplemented by gifts from other equally philanthropic and intelligent\r\nfriends of technical education, among the alumni of the school and\r\nothers, this germ of a trade school maybe developed into a complete\r\ninstitution for instruction in the arts and trades of engineering, and\r\nmay thus be rendered vastly more useful by meeting the great want, in\r\nthis locality, of a real trade school, as well as fill the requirements\r\nof the establishment of which it forms a part, by giving such trade\r\neducation as the engineer needs and can get time to acquire.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of advanced courses of special instruction in\r\nthe principal branches of mechanical engineering may, if properly\r\n\"dovetailed\" into the organization, be made a means of somewhat\r\nrelieving the pressure that must be expected to be felt in the attempt\r\nto carry out such a course as is outlined below. The post-graduate\r\nor other special departments of instruction, in which, for example,\r\nrailroad engineering, marine engineering, and the engineering of cotton,\r\nwoolen, or silk manufactures, are to be taught, may be so organized that\r\nsome of the lectures of the general course may be transferred to them,\r\nand the instructors in the latter course thus relieved, while the\r\nsubjects so taught, being treated by specialists, may be developed more\r\nefficiently and more economically.\r\n\r\nOutlines of these advanced courses, as well as of the courses in trade\r\ninstruction comprehended in the full scheme of mechanical engineering\r\ncourses laid out by the writer a dozen years ago, and as since recast,\r\nmight be here given, but their presentation would occupy too much space,\r\nand they are for the present omitted.\r\n\r\nThe course of instruction in this branch of engineering, at the Stevens\r\nInstitute of Technology, is supplemented by \"Inspection Tours,\" which\r\nare undertaken by the graduating class toward the close of the last\r\nyear, under the guidance of their instructors, in which expeditions they\r\nmake the round of the leading shops in the country, within a radius of\r\nseveral hundred miles, often, and thus get an idea of what is meant by\r\nreal business, and obtain some notion of the extent of the field of work\r\ninto which they are about to enter, as well as of the importance of\r\nthat work and the standing of their profession among the others of the\r\nlearned professions with which that of engineering has now come to be\r\nclassed.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the course of instruction, as originally proposed, and\r\nas now carried out, the student prepares a \"graduating thesis,\" in which\r\nhe is expected to show good evidence that he has profited well by the\r\nopportunities which have been given him to secure a good professional\r\neducation. These theses are papers of, usually, considerable extent, and\r\nare written upon subjects chosen by the student himself, either with or\r\nwithout consultation with the instructor. The most valuable of\r\nthese productions are those which present the results of original\r\ninvestigations of problems arising in practice or scientific research\r\nin lines bearing upon the work of the engineer. In many cases, the\r\nwork thus done has been found to be of very great value, supplying\r\ninformation greatly needed in certain departments, and which had\r\npreviously been entirely wanting, or only partially and unsatisfactorily\r\ngiven by authorities. Other theses of great value present a systematic\r\noutline of existing knowledge of some subject which had never before\r\nbeen brought into useful form, or made in any way accessible to the\r\npractitioner. In nearly all cases, the student is led to make the\r\ninvestigation by the bent of his own mind, or by the desire to do work\r\nthat may be of service to him in the practice of his profession. All\r\ntheses are expected to be made complete and satisfactory to the head\r\nof department of Engineering before his signature is appended to the\r\ndiploma which is finally issued to the graduating student. These\r\npreliminaries being completed, and the examinations having been reported\r\nas in all respects satisfactory, the degree of Mechanical Engineer is\r\nconferred upon the aspirant, and he is thus formally inducted into the\r\nranks of the profession.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURSE OF INSTRUCTION IN MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert H.

An ingenious method of avoiding this difficulty has\r\nbeen devised, we believe in Germany, and has been put into practice with\r\na certain amount of success. It consists in lining the iron boiler with\r\na covering of lead, caused by fusion to unite firmly to the walls of the\r\nboiler, and thus to protect it from the action of the acid. No trouble,\r\nit is stated, is found to arise from the difference in expansion of the\r\ntwo metals, which, moreover, adhere fairly well; but, on the other hand,\r\nwe believe it does actually occur that the repairs to this lead lining\r\nare numerous, tedious, and costly of execution, so that the system can\r\nscarcely be regarded as meeting the requirements of the manufacturer.\r\nIt is to secure all the advantages possessed by a lead-lined vessel,\r\nwithout the drawback of frequent and expensive repairs, that the\r\ndigester, of which we annex illustrations, has been devised by Mr.\r\nGeorge Knowles, of Billiter House, Billiter Street. It consists of a\r\nclosed iron cylindrical vessel suitable for boiling under pressure, and\r\ncontaining a second vessel open at the top, and of such a diameter as to\r\nleave an annular space between it and the walls of the outer shell. This\r\ninner receiver, which may be made of lead, glass, pottery, or any\r\nother suitable material, contains the substance to be treated and the\r\nsulphurous acid or other solution in which it is to be boiled. The\r\nannular space between the two vessels is filled with water to the same\r\nlevel as the solution in the receiver, and the latter is provided with\r\nsuitable pipes or coils, in which steam is caused to circulate for\r\nthe purpose of raising the solution of the desired temperature, and\r\neffecting the digesting process. At the same time any steam generated\r\ncollects in the upper part of the boiler, and maintains an equal\r\npressure within the whole apparatus. Figs. 1 to 3 show the arrangement\r\nclearly. Within the boiler, a, is placed the receiver, b, of pottery,\r\nlead, or other material, leaving an annular space between it and the\r\nboiler; this space is filled with water. The receiver, b, is furnished\r\nwith a series of pipes, in which steam or hot water circulates, to heat\r\nthe charge to the desired temperature. These pipes may be arranged\r\neither in coils, as shown at d, Fig. 1, or vertically at d, Fig. 3. The\r\nlatter are provided with inner return pipes, so that any condensed water\r\naccumulating at the bottom may be forced up the inner pipes by the\r\nsteam pressure and escape at the top. The vessel is charged through the\r\nmanhole, e, and the hopper, c, provided with a perforated cover, and is\r\ndischarged at the bottom by the valve, f, shown in Figs. 2 and 3. The\r\nupper part of the boiler serves as a steam dome, and the pressure on the\r\nliquid in the receiver and on the water in the annular space is thereby\r\nmaintained uniform. The necessary fittings for showing the pressure\r\nin the vessel, water level indicator, safety valve, cocks for testing\r\nsolutions, etc., are of course added to the apparatus, but are not\r\nindicated in the drawing. The arrangement appears to us to possess\r\nconsiderable merit, and we shall refer to it again on another occasion,\r\nafter experiments have been made to test its efficiency.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IMPROVED DOUBLE BOILER.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GARDNER MACHINE GUN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--SINGLE BARREL GARDNER MACHINE GUN.]\r\n\r\nThe mechanism by which the various functions of loading, firing, and\r\nextracting are performed is contained in a rectangular gun metal case,\r\nvarying in dimensions with the number of barrels in the arm. In the\r\nsingle barrel gun the size of this case is 14 inches in length, 5½\r\ninches in depth, and 2½ inches in width. The top of the box is hinged,\r\nso that easy access can be had to the mechanism, which consists of a\r\nlock, the cartridge carrier, and the devices for actuating them. In the\r\nmultiple barrel guns, the frames which, with the transverse bar at the\r\nend, hold the barrels in place, form the sides of the mechanism chamber,\r\nin the front end of which the barrels are screwed. The mechanism is\r\nactuated by a cam shaft worked by a hand crank on one side of the\r\nchamber. By this means the locks are driven backward and forward,\r\nthe latter motion forcing the cartridges into place, and the former\r\nwithdrawing the empty cartridge case after firing. The extractor hook\r\npivoted to the lock plunger rises, as the lock advances, over the rim of\r\nthe case, but is rigid as the lock is withdrawn, so that the action is\r\na positive one. The cartridges, which are contained in a suitable\r\nframe attached to the forward part of the breech chamber, pass through\r\nopenings in the top plate of the latter, an efficient distribution being\r\nsecured by means of a valve having a transverse motion. Each cartridge\r\nas it falls is brought into the axis of the barrel and the plunger,\r\nwhile the advance motion of the lock forces them into position. In the\r\nfive-barrel gun illustrated by Fig. 3 the cartridge feeder contains 100\r\ncartridges, in five Vertical rows of 20 cartridges each, and these are\r\nkept supplied, when firing, from supplementary holders. Fig. 1 shows the\r\nportable rest manufactured by the Gardner Gun Company. It consists of\r\ntwo wrought iron tubes, placed at right angles to each other; the front\r\nbar can be easily unlocked, and placed in line with the trail bar, from\r\nwhich project two arms, each provided with a screw that serves for the\r\nlateral adjustment of the gun. These screws are so arranged as to allow\r\nfor an oscillating motion of the gun through any distance up to 15 deg.\r\nThe tripod mounting, used for naval as well as land purposes, is shown\r\nin Fig. 2, which illustrates the two barrel gun complete. The five\r\nbarrel gun, Fig. 3, is shown mounted on a similar tripod. The length of\r\nthis weapon over all is 53.5 inches, the barrels (Henry system) are 33\r\ninches long, with seven grooves of a uniform twist of one turn in 22\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.--TWO BARREL GARDNER GUN.]\r\n\r\nGardener's five barrel gun in the course of one of the trials fired\r\n16,754 rounds with only 24 jams, and in rapid firing reached a maximum\r\nof 330 shots in 30 seconds. The two barrel gun fired 6,929 rounds\r\nwithout any jam; the last 3,000 being in 11 minutes 39 seconds, without\r\nany cleaning or oiling.--_Engineering_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--FIVE BARREL GARDNER GUN.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLIMBING TRICYCLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cycle trade is one which has been developed with great rapidity\r\nwithin the last ten years, and, like all new industries, has called\r\nforth a considerable amount of ingenuity and skill on the part of those\r\nengaged in it. We cannot help thinking, however, that much of this\r\ningenuity has been misplaced, and that instead of striving after new\r\nforms involving considerable complication and weight, it would have\r\nbeen better and more profitable if manufacturers had moderated their\r\naspirations, and aimed at greater simplicity of design; for it must\r\nbe remembered that cyclists are, as a rule, without the slightest\r\nmechanical knowledge, while the machines themselves are subject to very\r\nhard usage and considerable wear and tear in traveling over the\r\nordinary roads in this country. We refer, of course, more especially to\r\ntricycles, which in one form or another are fast taking the place of\r\nbicycles, and which promise to assume an important position in every\r\nday locomotion. Hitherto one of the chief objections to the use of the\r\ntricycle has been the great difficulty experienced in climbing hills, a\r\nvery slight ascent being sufficient to tax the powers of the rider to\r\nsuch an extent as to induce if not compel him in most instances to\r\ndismount and wheel his machine along by hand until more favorable ground\r\nis reached. To obviate this inconvenience many makers have introduced\r\nsome arrangement of gearing speeds of two powers giving the necessary\r\nvariation for traveling up hill and on the level. We noticed, however,\r\none machine at the exhibition which seemed to give all that could be\r\ndesired without any gearing or chains at all. This was a direct action\r\ntricycle shown by the National Cycle Company, of Coventry, in which the\r\npressure from the foot is made to bear directly upon the main axle, and\r\nso transmitted without loss to the driving wheels on each side, the\r\nposition of the rider being arranged so that just sufficient load is\r\nallowed to fall on the back wheel as to obtain certainty in steerage.\r\nThe weight of this machine is much less than when gearing is used, and\r\nthe friction is also considerably reduced, trials with the dynamometer\r\nhaving shown that on a level, smooth road, a pull of 1 lb. readily\r\nmoved it, while with a rider in the seat 4 lb. was sufficient. On this\r\ntricycle any ordinary hill can, it is stated, be ascended with great\r\nease, and as a proof of its power it was exhibited at the Stanley show\r\nclimbing over a piece of wood 8 in. high, without any momentum whatever.\r\nWe understand that at the works at Coventry a flight of stairs has been\r\nerected, and that no difficulty is experienced in ascending them on one\r\nof these machines.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBMARINE EXPLORATIONS.\r\n\r\nVOYAGE OF THE TALISMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was but a few years ago that the idea was prevalent that the seas at\r\ngreat depths were immense solitudes where life exhibited itself under no\r\nform, and where an eternal night reigned. To-day, thanks to expeditions\r\nundertaken for the purpose of exploring the abysses of the ocean, we\r\nknow that life manifests itself abundantly over the bottom, and that\r\nat a depth of five and six thousand meters light is distributed by\r\ninnumerable phosphorescent animals. Different nations have endeavored to\r\nrival each other in the effort to effect these important discoveries,\r\nand several scientific missions have been sent to different points of\r\nthe globe by the English and American governments. The French likewise\r\nhave entered with enthusiasm upon this new line of research, and for\r\nfour consecutive years, thanks to the devoted aid of the ministry of the\r\nmarine, savants have been enabled to take passage in government vessels\r\nthat were especially arranged for making submarine explorations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRENCH SCIENTIFIC STEAMER TALISMAN.]\r\n\r\nThe first French exploration, which was an experimental trip, was made\r\nin 1880 by the Travailleur in the Gulf of Gascogne. Its unhoped\r\nfor results had so great an importance that the following year the\r\ngovernment decided to continue its researches, and the Travailleur was\r\nagain put at the disposal of Mr. Alph. Milne Edwards and the commission\r\nover which he presided. Mr. Edwards traversed the Gulf of Gascogne,\r\nvisited the coast of Portugal, crossed the Strait of Gibraltar, and\r\nexplored a great portion of the Mediterranean. In 1882 the same vessel\r\nundertook a third mission to the Atlantic Ocean, and as far as to the\r\nCanary Islands. The Travailleur, however, being a side-wheel advice-boat\r\ndesigned for doing service at the port of Rochefort, presented none\r\nof those qualities that are requisite for performing voyages that are\r\nnecessarily of long duration. The quantity of coal that could be stored\r\naway in her bunkers was consumed in a week, and, after that, she could\r\nnot sail far from the points where it was possible for her to coal up\r\nagain. So after her return Mr. Edwards made a request for a ship that\r\nwas larger, a good sailer, and that was capable of carrying with it a\r\nsufficient supply of fuel for remaining a long time at sea, and that\r\nwas adapted to submarine researches. The Commission indorsed this\r\napplication, and the Minister of Instruction received it and transmitted\r\nit to Admiral Jauréguiberry--the Minister of the Marine--who at once\r\ngave orders that the Talisman should be fitted up and put in commission\r\nfor the new dredging expedition. This vessel, under command of Captain\r\nParfait, who the preceding year had occupied the same position on the\r\nTravailleur, left the port of Rochefort on the 1st of June, 1883, having\r\non board Mr. Milne Edwards and the scientific commission that had been\r\nappointed by the Minister of Public Instruction. The Talisman explored\r\nthe coasts of Portugal and Morocco, visited the Canary and Cape Verd\r\nIslands, traversed the Sea of Sargasso, and, after a stay of some time\r\nat the Azores, returned to France, after exploring on its way the Gulf\r\nof Gascogne (Fig.).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG.1.--CHART OF THE TALISMAN'S VOYAGE.]\r\n\r\nThe magnificent collections in natural history that were collected\r\non this cruise, and during those of preceding years made by the\r\nTravailleur, are, in a few days, to be exhibited at the Museum of\r\nNatural History. We think we shall be doing a service to the readers of\r\nthis journal, in giving them some details as to the organization of the\r\nTalisman expedition as well as to the manner in which the dredgings were\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG.2.--PLAN OF THE VESSEL.]\r\n\r\nThe vessel, as shown by her plan in Fig. 2, had to undergo important\r\nalterations for the cruise that she was to undertake. Her deck was\r\nalmost completely freed from artillery, since this would have encumbered\r\nher too much. Immediately behind the bridge, in the center of the\r\nvessel, there were placed two windlasses, one, A, to the right, and the\r\nother, B, to the left (Fig. 2). These machines, whose mode of operation\r\nwill be explained further along, were to serve for raising and lowering\r\nthe fishing apparatus. A little further back there were constructed\r\ntwo cabins, G and HH. The first of these was designed to serve as a\r\nlaboratory, and the second was arranged as quarters for the members of\r\nthe mission.\r\n\r\nThe sounding apparatus, the Brothergood engine for actuating it, and the\r\nelectric light apparatus were placed upon the bridge. The operating\r\nof the sounding line and of the electric light was therefore entirely\r\nindependent of that of the dredges. On the foremast, at a height of\r\nabout two meters, there was placed a crane, F, which was capable of\r\nmoving according to a horizontal plane. Its apex, as may be seen from\r\nthe plan of the boat, was capable of projecting beyond the sides of the\r\nship, to the left and right. To this apex was fixed a pulley over which\r\nran the cable that supported the dredges or bag-nets, which latter were\r\nthus carried over the boat's sides.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG.3.--DIAGRAM OF THE THIBAUDIER SOUNDING APPARATUS.]\r\n\r\nThe preliminary operation in every submarine exploration consists in\r\nexactly determining the depth of the sea immediately beneath the vessel.\r\nTo effect this object different sounding apparatus have been proposed.\r\nAs the trials that were made of these had shown that each of them\r\npossessed quite grave defects, Mr. Thibaudier, an engineer of the navy,\r\ninstalled on board the Talisman last year a new sounding apparatus which\r\nhad been constructed according to directions of his and which have given\r\nresults that are marvelous. The apparatus automatically registers the\r\nnumber of meters of wire that is paid out, and as soon as the sounding\r\nlead touches bottom, it at once stops of itself. This apparatus is shown\r\nin Fig. 4, and a diagram of it is given in Fig. 3, so that its operation\r\nmay be better understood. The Thibaudier sounding apparatus consists of\r\na pulley, P (Fig. 3), over which is wound 10,000 meters of steel wire\r\none millimeter in diameter. From this pulley, the wire runs over a\r\npulley, B, exactly one meter in circumference; from thence it runs to a\r\ncarriage, A, which is movable along wooden shears, runs up over a fixed\r\npulley, K, and reaches the sounding lead, S, after traversing a guide,\r\ng, where there is a small sheave upon which it can bear, whatever be the\r\ninclination of the boat. The wheel, B, carries upon its axle an endless\r\nscrew that sets in motion two toothed wheels that indicate the number\r\nof revolutions that it is making. One of these marks the units and the\r\nother the hundredths (Fig. 5). This last is graduated up to 10,000\r\nmeters. As every revolution of the wheel, B, corresponds to one meter,\r\nthe number indicated by the counter represents the depth. Upon the axle\r\nof the winding pulley there is a break pulley, p. The brake, f, is\r\nmaneuvered by a lever, L, at whose extremity there is a cord, C, which\r\nis made fast to the carriage, A. When, during the motions due to\r\nrolling, the tension of the steel wire that supports the lead diminishes\r\nor increases, the carriage slightly rises or falls, and, during these\r\nmotions, acts more or less upon the brake and consequently regulates the\r\nvelocity with which the wire unwinds. When the lead touches bottom, the\r\nwire, being suddenly relieved from all weight (which is sometimes as\r\nmuch as 70 kilos), instantly stops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--GENERAL VIEW OF THE SOUNDING APPARATUS IN THE\r\n\"TALISMAN:\"]\r\n\r\nThe maneuver of this apparatus may be readily understood. The apparatus\r\nand its weights are arranged in the interior of the vessel. A man bears\r\nupon the lever, L (Fig. 3), and the counter is set at zero. All being\r\nthus arranged, the man lets go of the break, and the unwinding then\r\nproceeds until the lead has touched bottom. During the operation of\r\nsounding, the boat is kept immovable by means of its engine, so that the\r\nwire shall remain as vertical as possible. The bottom being reached, the\r\nunwinding suddenly ceases, and there is nothing further to do but read\r\nthe indication given by the differential counter, this giving the depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--APPARATUS FOR MEASURING THE LENGTH OF THE WIRE\r\nPAID OUT.]\r\n\r\nNear the winding pulley, there is a small auxiliary engine, M, which\r\nis then geared with the axle of the said pulley, and which raises the\r\nsounding apparatus that has been freed from its weight by a method that\r\nwill be described further along.\r\n\r\nWe have endeavored in Fig. 4 to show the aspect of the bridge at the\r\nmoment when a sounding was about being made. From this engraving (made\r\nfrom a photograph) our readers may obtain a clear idea of the Thibaudier\r\nsounding apparatus, and understand how the wheel over which the wire\r\nruns is set in motion by the Brothergood engine.--_La Nature_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCABLE GRAPNEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome improvements have recently been made by Mr. Alexander Glegg and the\r\ninventor in the well-known Jamieson grapnel used for raising submerged\r\nsubmarine cables. The chief feature of the grapnel is that the flukes,\r\nbeing jointed at the socket, bend back against a spring when they catch\r\na rock, until the grapnel clears the obstruction, but allow the cable\r\nto run home to the crutch between the fluke and base, as shown in the\r\nfigures. In the older form the cable was liable to get jammed, and cut\r\nbetween the fixed toe or fluke and the longer fluke jointed into it.\r\nThis is now avoided by embracing the short fluke within the longer one.\r\nThe shank, formerly screwed into the boss, is now pushed through and\r\nkept up against the collar of the boss, by the volute spring, which at\r\nthe same time presses back the hinged flukes after being displaced by\r\na rock. The shank can now freely swivel round, whereas before it was\r\nrigidly fixed.

In your paper in December last you copied a short article\r\non \"Conscience in Boilermaking,\" in which the writer, after speaking\r\nof the tricks of the boilermaker in using thinner iron for the center\r\nsheets than for the others, and in \"upsetting\" the edges of the plates\r\nto make them appear thicker, goes on to say: \"We call attention to this,\r\nbecause the discovery of such practice has made serious trouble between\r\nthe boilermaker and the steam user. We would not believe that there were\r\nmen so blind to the duties and obligations which rest upon them as\r\nto resort to such practice, but the careful inspector finds all such\r\ndefects, and in time we come to know whose work is carefully and\r\nhonestly done, and whose is open to suspicion. In States and cities\r\nwhere inspection laws are in force that give the methods and rules by\r\nwhich the safe working pressure of a boiler is calculated, there is no\r\nalternative except to follow the rules; and if certain requirements\r\nregarding construction are a part of the law, there is no authority or\r\nright to depart from it, and yet there are boilermakers who try to force\r\ntheir boilers into such localities when their work is not up to the\r\nrequirements of the law.\"\r\n\r\nNow, if some boilermakers are so dishonest as to try and impose upon the\r\nlocomotive engineer, who they know will carefully examine every part of\r\nhis boiler, and who is able to detect any flaw, it is not to be expected\r\nthat the farmer will escape. Nor does he. The great number of explosions\r\nof boilers used in thrashing and in other farm work proves that there\r\nare boilermakers who \"force their boilers into such localities\r\nwhen their work is not up to the requirements of the law.\" And the\r\nboilermaker, if he be dishonest, is doubly tempted if the broad width of\r\na continent intervenes between him and the farmer for whom his work is\r\nintended, and if in the place where the boiler is to be used there are\r\nno inspection laws in force. The farmer who lives many miles from a\r\ncity, and who has no means of testing any boiler he may purchase,\r\nis wholly at the mercy of the boilermaker, and must run it until it\r\nexplodes or time proves it to have been honestly made. Then, again,\r\nthere are boilermakers who, although making boilers of good iron and of\r\nthe proper thickness, finish them off so badly that the farmer is put to\r\ngreat inconvenience and expense to put them in working order. Two years\r\nago I purchased a straw-burning engine and boiler made by an Eastern\r\nfirm. Before it had run ten days the boiler began to leak at the\r\nsaddle-bolt holes. The engineer tightened the nuts as far as possible,\r\nbut could not stop the leaks, which at last became so bad that we had to\r\nstop work and take the engine to the shop. Upon taking off the saddle\r\nand taking out the bolts it was discovered that they were too small for\r\nthe holes in the boiler, and that they had been wrapped with candle wick\r\nand white lead to make them fill the holes, and that a light washer had\r\nbeen put on each bolt between the head and the inside of the boiler.\r\nThis washer kept the lead in its place, and prevented the boiler from\r\nshowing a leak when first fired up. The water pipes in the fire-box soon\r\ngave out and became utterly useless. Upon inquiring of the patentee of\r\nthis straw-burning device, who was supposed to have put it in my boiler,\r\nhe stated that he had had nothing to do with it, but that it was put in\r\nby the firm selling these engines, and \"as cheaply as possible.\" Before\r\nI got this boiler and engine in fair running order I had spent hundreds\r\nof dollars and had to do entirely away with the water grates.\r\n\r\nLast summer, needing another tharshing engine, I was induced to buy\r\none of the same make as my old one, but with a different straw-burning\r\ndevice. The firm who sold it to me agreed that it should have none of\r\nthe faults of the old one. Well, I got it, and, upon hauling it out to\r\nmy ranch, and getting up steam, I found it to be much worse than the\r\nfirst one I had bought. The boiler leaked at nearly every hole where\r\na tap had been screwed into it. It took an engineer, a boilermaker, a\r\nblacksmith, and a fireman several days to get it in shape so that we\r\ncould use it at all; and after we did start up, the boilermaker had\r\nto be sent for several times to stop new leaks that were continually\r\nshowing themselves.\r\n\r\nI send you by this mail for your inspection one of the saddle bolts and\r\none of the bolts taken out of the piston, and also the certificates of\r\nthe engineer, boilermaker, and machinist who repaired the boiler. In\r\njustice to my fellow-farmers I ought to publish these certificates and\r\nthe names of these boilermakers to the world, but, for the present at\r\nleast, I refrain from so doing. These boilermakers will see this article\r\nand they will know, if the public does not, for whom it is intended. If\r\nit has the effect of making them exercise more care in the construction\r\nand fitting up of their engines and boilers, I have not written in vain.\r\n\r\nD. FREEMAN.\r\n\r\nLos Angeles, Cal., March 7,1884.\r\n\r\n[The two bolts and the certificates above referred to accompany the\r\nletter of Mr. Freeman. We can only wonder how it was that, after having\r\nbeen treated as he relates in the first instance, he should have had any\r\nfurther business with parties who would send out such boilers, for the\r\ntestimony of the engineer and workmen make the case even stronger than\r\nMr. Freeman has put it.--ED.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA THREADED SET COLLAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are cases where a long screw must be rotated with a traversing nut\r\nor other threaded piece traveling on its thread a limited and variable\r\ndistance. At one time the threaded nut or piece may be required to\r\ngo almost the entire length of the screw, and at another time a much\r\nshorter traverse would be required. In many instances the use of side\r\ncheck nuts is inconvenient, and in some it is impossible. One way of\r\nutilizing the nut as a set collar is to drill through its side for a set\r\nscrew, place it on its screw, pour a little melted Babbitt metal, or\r\ndrop a short, cold plug of it into the hole, tap the hole, and the tap\r\nwill force the Babbitt into the threads.\r\n\r\nInsert the set screw, and when it acts on the Babbitt metal it will\r\nforce it with great friction on to the thread without injuring the\r\nthread; and when the set screw tension is released, the nut turns\r\nfreely. A similar and perhaps a better result may be obtained by\r\nslotting the hole through the nut as though for the reception of a key.\r\nSecure a key (preferably of the same material as the nut) by slight\r\nupsetting at its ends, and then thread the nut, key, and all. Place\r\na set screw through the nut over the threaded key, and the job is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPNEUMATIC MALTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lethargy in the malting trade, and in all matters relating to\r\nmalting processes, induced by two centuries of restrictive legislation,\r\nis being gradually shaken off by the malting industry under the new law.\r\nFor many years nearly all improvements in malting processes originated\r\nabroad, as numberless Acts of Parliament fettered every process and the\r\nuse of every implement requisite in a malt-house in this country. The\r\nentire removal of these legislative restrictions gives an opportunity\r\nfor improved processes, which promises to open up a considerable\r\nfield for engineering work, and to develop a very backward art by the\r\napplication of scientific principles. The present time is, therefore,\r\none of more material change than malting has ever experienced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PNEUMATIC MALTING AT TROYES. Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\nOf the numerous improvements effected in the past few years, those made\r\nby M. Galland in France, and more recently by M. Saladin, are by far the\r\nmost prominent. M. Galland originated what is known as the pneumatic\r\nsystem eight or nine years ago. This system is carried out at the\r\nMaxéville brewery, near Nancy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PNEUMATIC MALTING AT TROYES. Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nSince that time further improvements have been made by M. Galland; but\r\nmore recently great advances have been made in the system by M.\r\nSaladin. He has developed the practice of the leading principle, and in\r\nconjunction with Mr. H. Stopes, of London, has added improved kilns and\r\nvarious mechanical apparatus for performing the work previously done by\r\nhand. He has also devised a very ingenious machine for cooling the moist\r\nair by which the process is carried on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--ECHANGEUR AND TURNING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nAt the recent Brewery Exhibition, some of the machinery used in these\r\nnew maltings was shown in action by Messrs. H. Stopes & Co., together\r\nwith drawings of a malting constructed at Troyes for M. Bonnette under\r\nM. Saladin's instructions. This malting is the third constructed for the\r\nsame firm, the others being at Nancy. That at Troyes we now illustrate.\r\nWe will not occupy space by a general description of the pneumatic\r\nsystem, one great feature in which is the continuous manufacture of malt\r\nthroughout the year instead of only from five to eight months of the\r\nyear, as it will be gathered from the following description of the\r\nTroyes malting:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--ECHANGEUR, AXIAL SECTION.]\r\n\r\nIn our engravings, Figs. 1, 2, and 3, the letter A indicates the\r\ngerminating cases; B, Saladin's patent turning screws; C A, air\r\nchannels; D, passages; E R, main driving shafts; e, pulleys; F, metal\r\nrecesses to fit turning screws; G, elevators; H, trap doors; I, air\r\nchannels; J, openings to growing floor for air; K S, engines and fan\r\nroom; L N, fans, supply and exhaust; T, boiler; U, chimney; f, well. The\r\ncapacity of the malting is 130 qr. malt every day. This is equivalent to\r\nan English house of 520 qr. steep. The whole space occupied is the area\r\nnecessary for kilns, malt and barley stores, engine and boiler house,\r\nand fans. No additional area is required for germinating floors, as ten\r\ngerminating cases, A, are placed in the basement below the kilns and\r\nstores. The building is of brick, with the internal walls below the\r\nground line resting upon cast iron columns and rolled joists. The\r\ngerminating cases, A A, are of iron; the bottoms are double. One of\r\nperforated plate is placed 6 inches above the bottom. These plates admit\r\nof draining the corn if the germinating case is used as a steeping\r\ncistern also. Their chief object is, however to admit of ready\r\ncirculation of the air by the means presently to be described. Large\r\nchannels, A a, serve as drains for moisture and to convey the air to or\r\nfrom the growing corn. Between each case is a passage, D, enabling the\r\nmaltster to have free access to the corn at all points.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--ECHANGEUR TRANSVERSE SECTION.]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the driving shaft, E, all the machinery is in\r\nduplicate, so that the possibility is remote of any breakdown that would\r\nseriously affect the working of the house. This is necessary, as should\r\nthe fans, L N, be stopped for twenty-four hours the corn germinating\r\nat a depth exceeding 30 inches would heat and impair its vitality. The\r\nboilers, T, and engines, S, are of the common type of 20 horse power\r\nnominal. The fans, L N, are the Farcot patent, illustrated a short time\r\nsince in our pages. The lower floors of the kilns are provided with\r\nthe Schlemmer patent mechanical turners. The turners, Fig. 4, in the\r\ngerminating cases are Saladin's patent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--ECHANGEUR, SECTIONAL PLAN.]\r\n\r\nThe germination of the grain is effected by means of cool moist air\r\nprovided by the fan described and the cooler and moistener--Figs. 5, 6,\r\nand 7, herewith--known as an _echangeur_. As the germinating grain has\r\na depth of from 30 inches to 40 inches some pressure is required, and\r\nmechanical means are necessary for efficient and economical turning.\r\nThe _echangeur_ is a very ingenious application of the well understood\r\nrapidity of evaporation of any liquid when spread out in very thin\r\nlayers over large surfaces and exposed to a current of air. It consists\r\nof a cylinder, or series of cylinders, of increasing diameter, placed\r\none within another. Each consists of finely perforated sheet iron. They\r\nare placed in a trough of water, just sufficiently immersed to insure\r\ncomplete wetting. When rotated at a slow speed, the surfaces of all the\r\ncylinders are kept just wetted. A volume of air is either driven or\r\ndrawn through, as may be required for any particular purpose. In the\r\nmodel malting, as shown at Fig. 4, taken from that shown at the Brewery\r\nExhibition, the air was driven through the _echangeur_ and thence\r\nthrough the germinating barley. Here or as employed in the malting\r\nillustrated, the air in its passage comes first into contact with the\r\nmoistened cylinders, and if hot and dry it becomes moist and cool, for\r\nthe constant evaporation upon the cylinders has a very considerable\r\nrefrigerating effect.\r\n\r\nThis was well known to the Egyptians over four thousand years ago, and\r\nthe porous bottle--_gergeleh_--of Esnch has been made until the present\r\nday, to keep the drinking water cool and fresh. The _echangeur_ is\r\nlike a gigantic gergeleh, and by increasing the size and number of the\r\ncylinders, and causing the water in the moistening trough to circulate,\r\nany volume of air can be wetted to the saturation limit corresponding to\r\nits temperature. It will be seen that this apparatus gives the maltster\r\ncomplete control of the humidity and heat as well as volume of the air\r\ndriven through germinating corn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe turning apparatus is shown by Fig. 4, and consists, as will be seen,\r\nof a cylindrical frame provided with rollers which run on rails at the\r\nedge of the germinating cases. It is carried to and fro from either end\r\nof the case by compensating rope gearing which at the same time gives\r\nmotion to the gearing actuating the turning screws. These screws do not\r\nquite touch the bottom of the germinating case, but are provided with a\r\npair of small brushes, as shown in the annexed engraving, Fig. 8, which\r\njust skim it. The apparatus shown has but three of these screws, but the\r\ncases are generally made wide enough for six. The kilns are double,\r\neach possessing two floors, and worked upon the Stopes' system. The\r\nconstruction of the furnaces is of the ordinary French pattern. The\r\narrangement of the house permits of great regularity in working. Every\r\nday 130 qrs. of barley is screened, sorted, cleaned, and passed into a\r\nsteeping cistern. When sufficiently steeped it runs through piping into\r\nthe germinating case, which, in the natural order of working, is empty.\r\nHere it forms the couch. When it is desirable to open couch a small\r\namount of air is forced through the grain by opening the trap door\r\nconnected with the main air channel. This furnishes the growing corn\r\nwith oxygen, removes the carbonic acid gas, and regulates temperatures\r\nof the mass of grain. Later the Saladin turner is put in motion about\r\nevery eight to twelve hours. The screws in rotating upon their axes are\r\nslowly propelled horizontally. They thus effectually turn the grain and\r\nleave it perfectly smooth. This turning prevents matting of the roots,\r\nthe regulation of temperature and exposure to air being effected\r\nby means of the cold air from the _echangeur_. When the grain is\r\nsufficiently grown it is elevated to the kilns. For forty hours it\r\nremains upon the top floor. It is then dropped upon the bottom floor, a\r\nfurther charge of green corn following upon the top floor. The benefit\r\nis mutual. The bottom floor is maintained at an even temperature, being\r\nvirtually plunged in an air bath; free radiation of heat is prevented;\r\nthe top surface of the malt is necessarily nearly as warm as that next\r\nthe wires, which in its turn is subject to lower heats than would be\r\nnecessary if free radiation from the surface was allowed. The top floor\r\nis by the intervention of the layer of malt between it and the fire\r\nprevented it from coming into direct contact with heat of a dangerous\r\nand damaging degree. The same heat which is used to dry one floor, and\r\nin an ordinary kiln passes at once into the air as waste, is the best\r\npossible description of heat, namely, very slightly moistened heated\r\nair, to remove the moisture from the second layer of malt at a low\r\ntemperature. It is of vital importance to retain this green malt at a\r\nlow heat so long as any percentage of moisture exceeding, say, 15 per\r\ncent, is retained by the corn.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of temperature is shown by the diagrams, Figs. 9 and 10:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the heated air in the kiln is rarely as uniform as\r\nis supposed, the temperature of the malt on drying floor being very\r\ndifferent at different parts. In illustration of this, the following may\r\nbe taken from a statement by Mr. Stopes of the results of an examination\r\nof the temperatures at different parts of a drying floor in a kiln in\r\nNorfolk: \"A malting steeping 105 qr. every four days has a kiln 75\r\nfeet by 36 feet; an average drying area of under 26 feet per qr. The\r\nconsequent depth of green malt when loaded is over 10 inches. The total\r\narea of air inlets is less than 27 feet super. The air outlet exceeds\r\n117 feet, a ratio of 13 to 3. The capacity of head room equals 44,550\r\nfeet cube. The area of each tile is 144 inches, with 546 holes, giving\r\nan effective air area of some 32 inches. The ratio of non-effective\r\nmetallic surface to air space is thus 9 to 2.\" The Casella anemometer\r\ngave no indications at several points, and fluctuating up and down\r\ndraughts were observable at many others, especially at two corners and\r\nalong the center. \"The strongest upward draught pulsated with the gusts\r\nof wind and ranged from 30 feet to 54 feet per minute, a down draught of\r\nequal intensity occurring at intervals at the same spot, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that the air was rushing in at the inlets below the floor at\r\nthe high velocity of 785 feet per minute. The temperatures of the drying\r\nmalt and superimposed air consequent upon the conditions thus indicated\r\nwere naturally as follows: At B, the place supposed to be hottest: Heat\r\nof malt touching tiles, 216 deg.; heat of malt 1 inch above tiles, 167\r\ndeg.; heat of malt 3 inches above tiles 154 deg.; heat of malt 4 inches\r\nabove tiles, 152 deg.; heat of malt 5 inches above tiles, 142 deg.; heat\r\nof malt on surface, 112 deg. At A, the place supposed to be coldest:\r\nHeat of malt next tiles, 174 deg.; heat of malt 2 inches above tiles,\r\n143 deg.; heat of malt 4 inches above tiles, 135 deg.; heat of malt on\r\nsurface, 104 deg.; the heat of the air 3 feet above tiles, 84 deg.; the\r\nheat of the air 5 feet above tiles, 82 deg. Fig. 9 shows the temperature\r\nat twenty-six points close to the tiles, taken with twelve registered\r\nand accurate thermometers in the space of fifteen minutes.\" These and\r\nother similar tests have led to the conclusion that the best malt drying\r\ncannot be done on a single floor.\r\n\r\nFig. 10 is a similar diagram showing the temperatures on a drying floor\r\nof kiln at Poole, Dorset, altered to Stopes' system of drying. The\r\ntemperature at different depths of the drying grain was as follows: Malt\r\nat surface of tiles, 142 deg.; malt at 1 inch above tiles, 142 deg.;\r\nmalt at 2 inches above tiles, 142 deg.; malt at 4 inches above tiles,\r\n141 deg.; malt on surface, 140 deg.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the Saladin system over that hitherto working in\r\nBritain are numerous, and are thus enumerated by Messrs. Stopes & Co.\r\nwho are agents for M. Saladin: The area occupied by the building does\r\nnot equal one-third of that otherwise required. The actual growing-floor\r\nspace is only about one-seventh, and the number of workmen is ruled\r\nnecessarily by the size of the house, but on an average is reduced\r\ntwo-thirds; but the employment of much more power is necessary, and the\r\npower is used at more frequent intervals. The use of plant and premises\r\nis continuous, the processes of malting being equally well performed\r\nduring the summer months. The further advantage of this is that brewers\r\nsecure entire uniformity in age of malt. By the English system the\r\nstocks of finished malt necessarily fluctuate largely. All grain is\r\nsubjected to the same conditions of surrounding air, exposure, and\r\ntemperature. The volume of air supplied to the germinating corn is\r\nentirely under control, as are also its temperature and humidity. When\r\ngermination is arrested and the green malt is drying, the double kilns\r\ninsure control of the temperatures of the corn in the kilns. The\r\ninfrequency of turning the germinating grain benefits the growth of the\r\nroots and the development of the plumule, besides saving much labor. No\r\ngrains are crushed or damaged by the feet or shovels of workmen. The air\r\nsupplied to the corn can be inexpensively freed from disease germs\r\nand impurities. The capital needed for malting can be reduced by the\r\ndiminished cost of installation, and the reduced stocks of malt on hand.\r\nThe quality of the malt made is considerably improved. The percentages\r\nof acidity are much reduced. The stability of the beer is increased,\r\nand a greater percentage of the extractive matter of the barley is\r\nobtainable by the brewer.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNON-SPARKING KEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfs. Ayrton and Perry lately described and exhibited before the\r\nPhysical Society their new ammeters and voltmeters, also a non-sparking\r\nkey. The well known ammeters and voltmeters of the authors used for\r\nelectric light work are now constructed so as to dispense with\r\na constant, and give the readings in amperes and volts without\r\ncalculation. This is effected by constructing the instruments so\r\nthat there is a falling off in the controlling magnetic field, and a\r\nconsiderable increase in the deflecting magnetic field. The deflections\r\nare thus made proportional to the current or E.M.F. measured. The\r\ningenious device of a core or soft iron pole-piece, adjustable between\r\nthe poles of the horseshoe magnet, is used for this purpose. By means of\r\nan ammeter and voltmeter used conjointly, the resistance of part of the\r\ncircuit, say a lamp or heated wire, can be got by Ohm's law.

R. E. CROMPTON and GISBERT KAPP.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Paper read before the Society of Telegraph Engineers, 14th\r\nFebruary, 1884.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the rapid development of that part of electrical\r\nscience which may be termed \"heavy electrical engineering,\" reliable\r\nmeasuring instruments specially suitable for the large currents\r\nemployed in lighting and transmission of energy have become an absolute\r\nnecessity. As usual, demand has stimulated supply, and many ingenious\r\nand useful instruments have been invented, the manufacture of which\r\nforms at the present day an important industry. Mr. Shoolbred, in a\r\npaper which he recently read before this Society, gave a full and\r\ninteresting account of the labors of our predecessors in this field.\r\nTo-day we add to the list then given a class of instruments invented by\r\nus, examples of which are now before you on the table. We have preferred\r\nto call them current and potential indicators in preference to meters,\r\nconsidering that the latter term, or rather termination, ought to be\r\napplied rather to integrating instruments, which the necessities of\r\nelectric lighting, we believe, will soon bring into extensive use. The\r\nprincipal aim in the design of these indicators has been to obtain\r\ninstruments which will not alter their calibration in consequence of\r\nexternal disturbing forces. If this object can be attained, then it will\r\nbe possible to divide the scale of each instrument directly into amperes\r\nor volts, as the cause may be, and thus avoid the use of a coefficient\r\nof calibration by which the deflection has to be multiplied. This is an\r\nimportant consideration when it is remembered that in many cases\r\nthese instruments have to be used by unskilled workmen, to whom a\r\nmultiplication involving the use of demical fractions is a tedious and\r\nin some cases even an impossible task.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nAll measurements are comparative. We measure weights or forces by\r\ncomparison with some generally known and accepted unit standard\r\nweights, lengths, areas, and volumes, by comparison with a unit length,\r\nresistance by a standard ohm, and so forth. In the same way currents\r\ncould be measured by comparison with a standard current: but this\r\nwould be a troublesome process, not only on account of the apparatus\r\nnecessary, but also because it would be a matter of some difficulty to\r\nhave a standard current always ready for use. In general, measurement\r\nby direct comparison with a standard unit is discarded for the more\r\nindirect method of measuring not the current itself, but its chemical,\r\nmechanical, or magnetic effect. The chemical method is very accurate if\r\na proper density of current through the surface of the electrodes be\r\nused,[1] but since it requires a considerable time, and, above all, an\r\nabsolutely constant current, its use is almost entirely restricted\r\nto laboratory work and to the calibration of other instruments. For\r\npractical ready use, instruments employing the mechanical or magnetic\r\neffect of the current are alone suitable. We weigh, so to speak, the\r\ncurrent against the force of a magnet, of a spring, or of gravity.\r\nThe measurement will be exact if the thing against which we weigh or\r\ncounterbalance the current itself retains its original standard value.\r\nWhere permanent magnets or springs are used as a balancing force, this\r\ncondition of constancy in our weights and measures is not always fully\r\nmaintained, and to make matters worse, there is no visible sign by which\r\na change, should it have occurred, can be readily detected. A spring\r\nmay have been overstrained or a steel magnet may have become weakened\r\nwithout showing the least alteration in outward appearance. To overcome\r\nthis difficulty, the obvious remedy is not to use springs or steel\r\nmagnets at all, but to substitute for these some other force which\r\nshould be either absolutely constant, such as the force of gravity, or\r\nat least should, vary only within narrow limits, and this in accordance\r\nwith a definite law. This latter condition can be fulfilled by the\r\nemployment of electro-magnets.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: According to recent experiments made by Dr. Hammerl, the\r\ndensity of current in a copper voltameter should be half an ampere per\r\nsquare inch of surface.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 3.]\r\n\r\nTo imitate with an electro magnet as nearly as possible a permanent\r\nmagnet, so that the former can be used to replace the latter, it is\r\nnecessary that the magnetism in the iron core should remain constant.\r\nThis could, of course, be done by exciting the electro magnet with a\r\nconstant current from a separate source. (In a recent note to the Paris\r\nAcademy of Science, M.E. Ducretet described a galvanometer with steel\r\nmagnet, which is surrounded by an exciting coil. When recalibration\r\nappears necessary, a known standard current from large Daniell cells is\r\nsent through this coil during a certain time, and thus the magnet is\r\nbrought back to its original degree of saturation. M. Ducretet also\r\nmentions the use of a soft iron bar instead of a steel magnet, in which\r\ncase the current from the Daniell cells must be kept on during the time\r\nan observation is taken.) But such a system would appear to be too\r\ncomplicated for ready use. Moreover, some sort of indicator would be\r\nrequired by which we could make sure that the exciting current has the\r\nnormal strength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 4.]\r\n\r\nThe plan we adopt is to excite the electro magnet by the whole or a part\r\nof the current which is to be measured. Since this current varies, the\r\npower exciting the core of the electro magnet must also vary; and since\r\nwe require the core to have as nearly as possible a permanent magnetic\r\nforce, we are brought face to face with the question, whether an electro\r\nmagnet can be constructed that has a constant moment under varying\r\nexciting currents. This question has been answered by the well known\r\nexperiments of Jacobi, Dub, Mueller, Weber, and others. To get an\r\nabsolutely constant magnetic moment, is not possible, but between\r\ncertain limits we can get a very near approximation to constancy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe relation between exciting power and magnetic moment is very\r\ncomplicated, depending not only on the dimensions and shape of the core\r\nand the manner of winding, but also on the chemical constitution of the\r\niron of the core. It is not possible, or at least it has hitherto not\r\nbeen found possible, to embody all these various elements into an exact\r\nmathematical formula, which would give the magnetic moment as a function\r\nof the exciting current; but the above mentioned experiments have shown\r\nthat within certain limits, and in the neighborhood of the point of\r\nsaturation, the relation between the two is that of an arc to its\r\ngeometrical tangent. It will be seen that for large angles the arc\r\nincreases much slower than the tangent; that is, for strongly excited\r\ncores, a very large increase of the exciting current will produce only\r\na slight increase of magnetic moment. If Mueller's formula were correct\r\nfor all currents, absolute saturation could only be reached with an\r\ninfinite current. Whether this be the case or not, it is certain that\r\nthe greater the exciting current the less will a variation in it affect\r\nthe magnetic moment of the core. To imitate as nearly as possible\r\npermanent steel magnets, it is therefore necessary to use electro\r\nmagnets, the cores of which are easily saturated. The core should be\r\nthin and long and of the horseshoe type; the amount of wire wound round\r\nit should be large in comparison with the size of the core.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHere is a magnet partly wound which was used in one of our earliest\r\nexperiments, but which was a failure on account of having far too much\r\nmass in the core in comparison with the amount of copper wire wound\r\nround it. Since then we have greatly diminished the iron and increased\r\nthe copper. The cores of the instruments on the table are composed of\r\ntwo or three No. 18 b.w.g. charcoal iron wires, and are wound with one\r\nlayer of 0'120 inch wire in the case of the current indicators, and\r\neighteen layers of 0.0139 inch wire in the case of the potential\r\nindicator. If from the diagram, Fig. 1, we plot a curve the abscissae of\r\nwhich represent exciting current, and the ordinates magnetic moment of\r\nthe soft iron core, we find that a considerable portion of the curve\r\nis almost a straight and only slightly inclined line. If it, were a\r\nhorizontal straight line the core would be absolutely saturated, but\r\nsuch as it is, it answers the purpose sufficiently well, for with a\r\nvariation of exciting current from 10 to 100 amperes the magnetic moment\r\nvaries but slightly. If a small soft iron or magnetic steel needle, _n\r\ns_, be suspended between the poles, S N, of an electro magnet of such\r\nproportions as described above, and the current, after exciting the\r\nelectro magnet, _e e_, be lead round the coils, DD, it will be found\r\nthat for all currents between 10 and 100 amperes the needle, _n\r\ns_, shows a definite deflection for each current. Here we have a\r\ngalvanometer with permanent calibration. In this case the deflection of\r\nthe needle will not strictly follow the law of tangents, because the\r\ndirecting power of the electro magnet is not absolutely constant; but\r\nwhatever the exact ratio between deflection and current may be, it must\r\nalways remain the same, and to each angle of deflection corresponds one\r\ndefinite strength of current.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe force with which the electro magnet tends to keep the needle in its\r\nzero position, that is, in line with the poles, S N, is due partly to\r\nthe magnetism of the core, which is nearly constant, and partly to the\r\nmagnetic influence of the coils, _ee_, themselves, which is, of course,\r\nsimply proportional to the current. The total magnetic force acting on\r\nthe needle is, therefore, represented by the sum of these two forces,\r\nand consequently not nearly so constant as might be desired in order to\r\nget a good imitation of a tangent galvanometer with a permanent magnet.\r\nIn the diagram, Fig. 2, the curve, O A B, represents the magnetic moment\r\nof the iron core, the straight line, ODE, that of the exciting coils per\r\nse, and the dotted line, O F M, the sum of the two, obtained by adding\r\nfor every current, O C, the respective ordinates, CD and C A.\r\n\r\n  CF = CD + CA\r\n\r\nThe rise of this curve shows that the force which tends to bring the\r\nneedle back to its zero position increases with the current, though at a\r\nslower ratio than the deflecting force of the current. It follows from\r\nthis that for large currents the increment in the angle of deflection is\r\ncomparatively small, and the divisions on the scale whereon the current\r\nis to be read off would come too near together to allow accurate\r\nreadings to be taken. In other words, the range of accurate reading in\r\nan instrument so constructed would only be limited. But it is very easy\r\nto eliminate the magnetic effect of the coils of the electro magnet on\r\nthe needle, by introducing an opposite magnetic effect, so that only\r\nthat part of the force remains which belongs to the soft iron core\r\nproper. One way of doing this is by surrounding the needle with a coil,\r\nthe plane of which is at right angles to the line, S N, and coupling\r\nthis coil in series with the deflecting coil, D D. If the proportions\r\nof this transverse coil and the direction of the current through it\r\nbe properly chosen, its magnetic effect can be made to exactly\r\ncounterbalance that of the exciting coils, _e e_, without perceptibly\r\nweakening the magnetism of the iron core. But instead of employing two\r\ncoils, one parallel and the other transversely to the zero position of\r\nthe needle, we can obtain the same result in a more simple manner with\r\none coil only, if this be placed at such an angle that its magnetic\r\neffect can be substituted for the combined effects of the two coils. In\r\nother words, we set the deflecting coil, D D, at a certain angle to the\r\nzero position of the needle.\r\n\r\nA similar arrangement, though not precisely for the same purpose, has\r\nalready been suggested and tried by Messrs. Deprez, Carpentier, Ayrton,\r\nand Perry, in galvanometers with permanent steel magnets. If the coil,\r\nD D, be so placed, the deflecting force which now acts obliquely can be\r\nconsidered as the resultant of two forces, one acting at right angles to\r\nthe line, S N, as in an ordinary galvanometer, and the other parallel to\r\nthis line, but in a sense opposed to the action of the electro magnet\r\nand its exciting coils. If the angle of obliquity be so chosen that this\r\nlatter component exactly equals the magnetic effect of the exciting\r\ncoils _per se_, an equality which holds good for all currents, then we\r\nshall have an almost perfect imitation of a tangent galvanometer with\r\npermanent magnets. But we can go a step further than this; we can\r\noverbalance the exciting coils by setting the deflecting coil at a\r\ngreater angle than necessary for the mere elimination of the former, and\r\nthus attain that an increase of current results in a slight weakening of\r\nthe field in which the needle swings, thus allowing the increment of the\r\nangle of deflection to be comparatively large even for large currents.\r\nIn this way it is possible to obtain a more evenly divided scale than\r\nin the case when the deflection follows the law of tangents, as in an\r\nordinary tangent galvanometer. This principle of overbalancing the\r\nexciting coils is shown on diagram, Fig. 2. The straight line, O G,\r\nrepresents the magnetic effect on the needle of that component of the\r\ndeflecting force which is parallel, but in sense opposed to S N;\r\nas mentioned above, the magnetic effect of the exciting coils is\r\nrepresented by the straight line, O E. The combined effect of these two\r\nforces on the needle is represented by the line, O K, the ordinates\r\nof which must be deducted from those of the curve, O A B, in order to\r\nobtain the total directing force due to each current. This is shown by\r\nthe curve, O P Q, shown in a thick full line. This curve shows how\r\nthe directing force or strength of field in which the needle swings\r\ndecreases with an increasing current. That this does actually take place\r\ncan easily be proved by experiment.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 shows two curves; the one drawn in a full line is obtained\r\nby plotting the deflection in degrees of the needle of a potential\r\nindicator as abscissae, and the corresponding electromotive forces\r\nmeasured simultaneously on a standard instrument as ordinates; the\r\ndotted line shows what this curve would be with an ordinary tangent\r\ngalvanometer.\r\n\r\nThe needle of the potential indicator is mounted at the lower end of\r\na steel axle, to the upper end of which is fastened a light aluminum\r\npointer, whereby the deflection of the needle can be read off on a scale\r\ndivided directly into volts. The scale is placed within a circular dial\r\nplate with glass cover, giving sufficient room for the pointer to swing\r\nall round, and the needle is placed within a central tube fitting it\r\nclosely, which acts as a damper and so makes the instrument almost\r\ndead beat. Tube and dial are in one casting. The electro magnet is of\r\nhorseshoe form fastened to a central tubular stand, which also serves\r\nto support the two deflecting coils, one on either side of it. The tube\r\nwithin which the magnetic needle swings is inserted into the stand,\r\nwhich is bored out to the external diameter of the tube. The electro\r\nmagnet and deflecting coils are wound with from 50 to 100 ohms of fine\r\ninsulated copper wire, and an additional resistance coil of from 450\r\nto 900 ohms of German silver is added, which can, however, be short\r\ncircuited by depressing a key when the instrument has to be used for\r\nreading low electromotive forces. In this case the indication of the\r\npointer must be divided by ten. If a current be sent through the\r\ninstrument the wrong way, the needle turns through an angle of 180°, and\r\nthus brings the pointer to the side of the dial opposite to where the\r\nscale is. In this position no reading can be taken, and to facilitate\r\nthe sending of the current in the right direction a commutator is added,\r\nand the same is so coupled up that when the pointer stands over the\r\nscale the handle on the commutator points to the positive terminal\r\nscrew. There is a limit of electromotive force below which the indicator\r\nfails to give reliable readings. For instance, an instrument wound with\r\n100 ohms of copper wire and 900 ohms of German silver can be used for\r\nelectromotive forces varying between 300 and 3 volts, but would not be\r\nreliable for measuring less than 3 volts.\r\n\r\nFor very exact measurements the instrument should be placed north and\r\nsouth, in the same position in which it was calibrated. Two different\r\npatterns of current indicators are on the table; one with double needles\r\nsuspended on a point in the way compass magnets are suspended, the other\r\nwith one lozenge shaped needle mounted on an axle and pivoted on jewels,\r\nin every way similar to the needle of the potential indicator first\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nFor measurements of currents from 10 amperes upward, there is no need\r\nto employ a complete coil as the deflecting agent; one half-coil or one\r\nstrip passing close under the needle gives sufficient deflecting force,\r\nand thus the construction of the instrument is rendered extremely\r\nsimple. The current, after entering at one of the flat electrodes,\r\nsplits in two parts, each part passing round the winding of an electro\r\nmagnet of horseshoe form, the similar poles of both magnets pointing\r\ntoward each other and toward the needle. After traversing the winding,\r\nthe current unites again, and passes through a metal strip close under\r\nthe needle, and finally out of the instrument by the other electrode,\r\nwhich lies close under that at which the current entered, but is\r\ninsulated from it by a sheet of fiber. The metal strip is set at an\r\nangle, to balance or overbalance, as may be preferred, the magnetic\r\ninfluence of the exciting coils. The effect of this overbalancing is\r\nshown in Fig. 5, where the full curve represents the current as a\r\nfunction of the deflection--obtained by comparison with a standard\r\ninstrument--and the dotted curve shows what that relation between\r\ndeflection and current would be if the law of tangents held good for\r\nthese instruments. It will be seen that, about the middle of the scale,\r\nthe dotted line coincides nearly with the full line, while at the\r\nextreme end of the scale the dotted line is higher. From this follows,\r\nthat if we compare our indicator from which this curve was taken with\r\nany form of tangent instrument showing an equal angle of deflection at\r\nthe medium reading, it will be seen that the needle of our indicator\r\nwill be deflected to a greater angle at high readings than that of the\r\ntangent galvanometer. Consequently, the divisions on the scale will\r\nbe widest apart in our instruments, which greatly facilitates high\r\nreadings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECONDARY BATTERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Consolidated Electric Light Company has now completed the secondary\r\nbattery which has for some time engaged the attention of its officers,\r\nand their regular manufacture and use for electric lighting stations\r\nhave been fairly entered upon. Among other places to which the batteries\r\nhave been sent and put into work is Colchester, where the company\r\nhas for some time had an installation at work, chiefly employing\r\nincandescent lamps. The battery consists of lead electrodes, anode and\r\ncathode being of the same character. They are constructed of narrow\r\nribbons of lead, each element being made from long lengths of the ribbon\r\nabout or nearly 0.20 in. width, rolled together into a flat cake like\r\nrolls of narrow webbing, as illustrated by the annexed diagram, Fig.\r\n1, the greater part of the ribbon being very thin and flat; but\r\nintermediate thicker ribbons are also employed, as in Fig. 2, this\r\nthicker ribbon being corrugated as shown, and affording passage room\r\nfor the circulation of the electrolyte. From four to eight coils of the\r\nplain ribbons are between every pair of corrugated ribbons. They are\r\nwound up together tightly, and pressed into the nearly rectangular form\r\nshown. The bar for suspending the coil plates so made in the cells is\r\nsoldered to the coil. The object of this construction is of course to\r\nobtain large lead surface, and of course a much larger surface is so\r\nobtained than could be practically obtained from plain lead plates in\r\nthe same compass. A battery thus made may be seen at the offices of the\r\ncompany, 110 Cannon Street.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1. FIG. 2.]\r\n\r\nA very ingenious device for cutting the battery out of circuit when\r\ncharged as much as is thought desirable is used by the company. In a\r\ncell is an element which has a determined lower capacity than those in\r\nthe rest of the battery. Over this element is placed a gas-tight chamber\r\nin which is a diaphgram, this diaphragm being of very flexible material\r\nplaced in the cover of the box of cells. When charging has proceeded as\r\nlong as is desirable, or proceeds too fast, hydrogen is evolved, and\r\nthis collecting in the chamber referred to acts upon the diaphragm, and\r\nby means of a rod connected thereto, switches the current, which is\r\nsupplied to an electro-magnet and by which circuit is made through the\r\nmedium of mercury contacts. The object, of this is to save the\r\nbattery from destruction by over-charging or charging by too large a\r\ncurrent.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACETYLENE FROM IODOFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nP. CAZENEUVE publishes in the _Comptes Rendus_ a new method for the\r\npreparation of acetylene, which consists in mixing iodoform intimately\r\nwith moist and finely divided silver. An abundant evolution of acetylene\r\ntakes place without heating. The reaction is represented by the\r\nfollowing formula: 2CHI_{3} + 6Ag = C_{2}H_{2} + 6 AgI. The\r\ndecomposition of the iodoform is hastened if the silver is mixed with\r\nfinely divided copper, such as can be obtained by precipitating it from\r\nits sulphate by means of zinc.\r\n\r\nCazeneuve also observed that most metals which have any affinity for\r\niodine will decompose iodoform in the presence of water, forming\r\nacetylene and an iodide of the metal. By the use of zinc he obtained a\r\nliquid having a pleasant ethereal odor, and a gas mixture that contained\r\nbesides acetylene an iodine compound which burned with a purple-edged,\r\nfawn-colored flame.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN DOES AN ELECTRICAL SHOCK BECOME FATAL?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this age of electricity and electric wires carrying currents of\r\nvarious intensity, the question of danger arising from contact with them\r\nhas caused considerable discussion. An examination into the facts as\r\nthey exist may therefore enlighten some who are at present in the dark.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we often hear the question asked--why is it that certain\r\nwires carrying very large currents give very little shock, whereas\r\nothers, with very small currents, may prove fatal to those coming in\r\ncontact with them? The answer to this is--that the shock a person\r\nexperiences does not depend upon the current _flowing in the wires_, but\r\nupon the current _diverted from them_ and _flowing through the body_.\r\n\r\nThe muscular contraction due to a galvanic current, which was first\r\nobserved in the frog, gives a good illustration of the fact that it\r\nrequires only a very minute current to flow through the muscles in order\r\nto contract them. Thus the simple contact of pieces of zinc and copper\r\nwith the nerves generated current sufficient to excite the muscles--a\r\ncurrent which would require a delicate galvanometer for its detection.\r\nWhat is true of the muscles of the frog holds good also for the human\r\nmuscles; they too are very susceptible to the passage of a current.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the current which proves fatal we need only to\r\napply the formula which expresses Ohm's law, viz., C=E/R, or the current\r\n(ampere) equals the electromotive force (volt) divided by the resistance\r\n(ohm).\r\n\r\nAccording to the committee of Parliament investigation, the\r\nelectromotive force dangerous to life is about 300 volts; this then is\r\nthe quantity, E, in the formula. There remains now only to determine the\r\nresistance in ohms which the body offers to the passage of the current.\r\nIn order to obtain this, a series of measurements under different\r\nconditions were made. On account of the nature of the experiment a high\r\nresistance Thomson reflecting galvanometer was used, with the following\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nWhen the hands had been wiped perfectly dry, the resistance of the body\r\nwas about 30,000 ohms; with the hands perspiring ordinarily it fell to\r\n10,000 ohms; whereas when they were dripping wet it was as low as 7,000\r\nohms. Our readers can judge this resistance best when we state that the\r\nAtlantic cable offers a resistance of 8,000 ohms.\r\n\r\nTaking an ordinary condition of the body, with the hands perspiring as\r\nusual, we would have the resistance equal to 10,000 ohms. Applying the\r\ntwo known quantities in the formula, we get:\r\n\r\n  C = (300 / 10,000) - (1 / 33.333+)\r\n\r\nThis means, therefore, that when the electromotive force or potential is\r\ngreat enough to send a current of 1/33 ampere through the body, fatal\r\nresults will ensue. This current is so minute that it would deposit only\r\nabout 6 _grains_ of copper in _one hour_, a grain being 1/7,000 of a\r\npound.\r\n\r\nLet us now compare these figures with some actual cases, taking as\r\nan example a system of incandescent lighting. In these systems the\r\ndifference of potential between any two points of the circuit outside of\r\nthe lamps does not exceed 150 volts. Taking this figure, therefore, it\r\nwill be seen that under no circumstances can the shock received from\r\ntouching these wires become dangerous--not even by touching the\r\nterminals of the dynamo itself; because in neither case can a current be\r\ndriven through the body, sufficient to cause an excessive contraction of\r\nthe muscles.\r\n\r\nIn a system of arc lighting, however, we have to deal with entirely\r\ndifferent conditions; for, while in the incandescent system the adding\r\nof a lamp, which diminishes the resistance, requires no increase of\r\nelectromotive force, the contrary is the case in the arc light system.\r\nHere every additional lamp added to the circuit means an increase in\r\nresistance, and consequent increase in electromotive force or potential.\r\nTaking for example a well known system of arc lighting, we find that the\r\nlamps require individually an electromotive force of 40 volts with a\r\ncurrent of 10 amperes. In other words, the difference in potential at\r\nthe two terminals of every such lamp is 40 volts. Consequently, if the\r\ncircuit were touched in two places, including between them only one\r\nlamp, no injurious effects would ensue. If we touch the circuit so as\r\nto include two lamps between us, the effect would be greater, since the\r\npotential between those two points is 2 x 40 volts. We might continue\r\nin this manner touching the circuit until we had included about 7 or\r\n8 lamps, when the shock would become fatal, since the point would be\r\nreached at which the difference of potential is great enough to send a\r\ndangerous current through the body.\r\n\r\nUp to this point we have assumed that, while touching two points in the\r\nwire, the rest of the circuit is perfectly insulated, so that no current\r\ncan leak, in other words, that the circuit is nowhere \"grounded.\" If\r\nthis is not the case we may, under suitable conditions, receive a\r\nshock by touching only _one_ point of the wire. This becomes clear\r\nby considering the current to leak from another spot of different\r\npotential, to pass through the ground and into the body; thus, on\r\ntouching the wire the body virtually makes a connection between the\r\ntwo points of the circuit. In clear dry weather such leaks are\r\ninsignificant; but in damp and rainy weather, and with poor insulation,\r\nthey may rise to such a point at which it would be dangerous to touch\r\nthe circuit even with one hand, the leaks being sometimes so great as\r\nto cause the lamps to burn in a fitful, desultory manner, and to go out\r\nentirely.\r\n\r\nThere is still another factor which enters into the discussion of the\r\ndanger of electric light wires. This must be looked for in the fact that\r\nthe physiological effects are greatest at the moment of the opening or\r\nthe closing of the circuit; or in a closed circuit they are the more\r\nmarked when the flow of current stops and starts, or diminishes and\r\nincreases. In dynamo electric machines the current is not absolutely\r\ncontinuous or uniform, since the coils on the armature being separated a\r\ndistance cause a slight break or diminution of the current between each.\r\nThis break is so short that it does not interfere with the practical\r\nwork for lighting; in some constructions, nevertheless, the distances\r\napart is so great that, while not interfering with light, its effects\r\nupon the muscles are greatly increased over those of other constructions\r\nwhich give a more uniform current.\r\n\r\nAll these statements might lead to the conclusion that arc light wires\r\nare dangerous under any circumstances; but this is not the case. The\r\nfirst and only requisite is, that they be perfectly insulated. When thus\r\nprotected accidents from them are impossible, and all mishaps that have\r\noccurred through them can be traced directly to the lack of insulation.\r\nNevertheless, we would warn our readers against experimenting upon arc\r\nwires by actual trial, because unforeseen conditions might lead to\r\ndisagreeable results.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROBERT CAUER'S STATUE OF LORELEI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe statue of Lorelei, the mythical siren of the Rhine, represented in\r\nthe annexed cut, which is taken from the _Illustrirte Zeitung_, was\r\nmodeled by Robert Cauer, of Kreuglach on the Rhine. He was born at\r\nDresden in 1831, and is the son of the well-known sculptor Emil Cauer,\r\nand a brother of the sculptor Karl Cauer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORELEI STATUE BY ROBERT CAUER.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREDUCING AND ENLARGING PLASTER CASTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinary casts taken in plaster vary somewhat, owing to the shrinkage of\r\nthe plaster; but it has hitherto not been possible to regulate this\r\nso as to produce any desired change and yet preserve the proportions.\r\nHoeger, of Gmuend, has, however, recently devised an ingenious method\r\nfor making copies in any material, either reduced or enlarged, without\r\ndistortion.\r\n\r\nThe original is first surrounded with a case or frame of sheet metal or\r\nother suitable material, and a negative cast is taken with some elastic\r\nmaterial, if there are undercuts; the inventor uses agar-agar. The usual\r\nnegative or mould having been obtained as usual, he prepares a gelatine\r\nmass resembling the hektograph mass, by soaking the gelatine first, then\r\nmelting it and adding enough of any inorganic powdered substance to give\r\nit some stability. This is poured into the mould, which is previously\r\nmoistened with glycerine to prevent adhesion. When cold, the gelatine\r\ncast is taken from the mould, and is, of course, the same size as the\r\noriginal. If the copy is to be reduced, this gelatine cast is put in\r\nstrong alcohol and left entirely covered with it. It then begins to\r\nshrink and contract with the greatest uniformity. When the desired\r\nreduction has taken place, the cast is removed from its bath. From\r\nthis reduced copy a cast is taken as usual. As there is a limit to the\r\nshrinkage of the gelatine cast, when a considerable reduction is desired\r\nthe operation is repeated by making a plaster mould from the reduced\r\ncopy, and from this a second gelatine cast is taken and likewise\r\nimmersed in alcohol and shrunk. It is claimed that even when repeated\r\nthere is no sacrifice of the sharpness of the original.\r\n\r\nWhen the copy is to be enlarged instead of reduced, the gelatine cast is\r\nput in a cold water bath, instead of alcohol. After it has swollen as\r\nmuch as it will, the plaster mould is made as before. For enlarging,\r\nthe mould could also be made of some slightly soluble mass, and then by\r\nfilling it with water the cavity would grow larger, but it would not\r\ngive so sharp a copy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRIPPING THE FILM FROM GELATINE NEGATIVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have frequent inquiries as to the best means of removing a\r\ngelatino-bromide negative from its glass support so that it can be used\r\neither as a direct or reversed negative, and it does not appear to be\r\nvery generally known that about two years ago Mr. Plener described a\r\nmethod which answers well under all circumstances, whether a substratum\r\nhas been used or not.\r\n\r\nIf a negative is immersed in extremely dilute hydrofluoric acid\r\ncontained in an ebonite dish, say half a teaspoonful to half a pint of\r\nwater, the film very soon becomes loosened, and floats off the glass,\r\nthis circumstance being due to the solvent action which the acid\r\nexercises upon the surface of the plate as soon as it has penetrated the\r\nfilm. If the floating film be now caught upon a plate which has been\r\nslightly waxed, and it is allowed to dry on this plate, it will become\r\nquite flat and free from wrinkles. To wax the plate, it should be held\r\nbefore the fire until it is moderately hot, after which it is rubbed\r\nover with a lump of wax, and the excess is polished off with a piece\r\nof flannel. When the film is dry, it will leave the waxed glass\r\nimmediately, if one corner is lifted by means of a penknife. The film\r\nwill become somewhat enlarged during the above-described operation; but,\r\nby taking suitable precautions, this enlargement may be avoided. It is\r\nalso convenient to prepare the hydrofluoric acid extemporaneously by the\r\naction of sulphuric acid on fluoride of sodium; and, in many cases, it\r\nis advisable to thicken up the film by an additional layer of gelatine.\r\n\r\nThe following directions embody these points. The negative, which must\r\nbe unvarnished, is leveled, and covered with a layer of warm gelatine\r\nsolution (one in eight) about as thick as a sixpence. This done, and\r\nthe gelatine set, the plate is immersed in alcohol for a few minutes\r\nin order to remove the greater part of the water from the gelatinous\r\nstratum. The next step is to allow the plate to remain for five or six\r\nminutes in a cold mixture of one part of sulphuric acid with twelve\r\nparts of water, and in the mean time two parts of sodium fluoride are\r\ndissolved in one hundred parts of water, an ebonite tray being used. A\r\nvolume of the dilute sulphuric acid equal to about one-fourth of the\r\nfluoride solution is next added from the first dish, and the plate\r\nis then transferred to the second dish, when the film soon becomes\r\nliberated. When this is the case, it is placed once more in the dilute\r\nsulphuric acid. After a few seconds it is rinsed in water, and laid on a\r\nsheet of waxed glass, complete contact being established by means of a\r\nsqueegee, and the edges are clamped down by means of strips of wood held\r\nin position by American clips or string. All excess of sulphuric acid\r\nmay now be removed by soaking the plate in methylated alcohol, after\r\nwhich it is dried. It is as well to add a few drops of ammonia to the\r\nlast quantity of alcohol used.\r\n\r\nThe plate bearing the film negative is now placed in a warm locality,\r\nunder which circumstances a few hours will suffice for the complete\r\ndrying of the pellicular negative, after which it may be detached\r\nwith the greatest ease by lifting the edges with the point of a\r\npenknife.--_Photo.

SPRING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author asks in the first place, What is the cause of the different\r\nspecific gravities of one and the same metal according as it has been\r\ncast, rolled, drawn into wire, or hammered? Does the difference observed\r\nprove a real condensation of the matter under the action of pressure, or\r\nis it merely due to the expulsion by pressure of gases which have been\r\noccluded when the ingot was cast? According to well-known researches,\r\nmetals such as platinum, gold, silver, and copper, which have\r\nbeen proved to occlude gases on fusion, and to let them escape,\r\n_incompletely_, on solidification, are precisely those which are\r\nmost increased in their specific gravity by pressure. The author has\r\nsubmitted to pressures of about 20,000 atmospheres metals which possess\r\nthis property, either not at all, or to a very trifling extent, and he\r\nfinds that though a first pressure produces a slight permanent increase\r\nof density, its repetition makes little difference. Their density is\r\nfound to have reached a maximum. Hence the density of solids, like that\r\nof liquids, is only really modified by temperature. Pressure effects\r\nno permanent condensation of solid bodies, except they are capable of\r\nassuming an allotropic condition of greater density. The author's former\r\nresearches tend to show that solid matter, in suitable conditions of\r\ntemperature, takes the state corresponding to the volume which it is\r\ncompelled to occupy. Hence there is an analogy between the allotropic\r\nstates of certain solids and the different states of aggregation of\r\nmatter. Possibly the different forms of matter may be due to a single\r\ncause--polymerization. The limit of elasticity of a solid body is the\r\ncritical moment when the matter begins to flow under the action of the\r\npressure to which it is submitted, just as, e.g., ice at or below 0° may\r\nbe liquefied by strong pressure. A brittle body is simply one which does\r\nnot possess the property of flowing under the action of pressure.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDROGEN AMALGAM.\r\n\r\n\r\nHydrogen, although a gas, is recognized by chemists as a metal, and when\r\ncombined with any solid metal--as in the case known to electricians as\r\nthe polarization of a negative element,--the compound may correctly be\r\ntermed an alloy; while any compound of hydrogen with the fluid metal\r\nmercury may with equal correctness be termed an amalgam of hydrogen, or\r\n\"hydrogen amalgam.\" The efforts of many chemists and mining engineers\r\nhave for many years been devoted to a search for some effective and\r\neconomical means for preventing the \"sickening\" of mercury and its\r\nconsequent \"flouring\" and loss. Some sixteen or more years ago,\r\nProfessor Crookes, F.R.S., discovered and, after a series of\r\nexperiments, patented the use of an amalgam of the metal sodium for this\r\npurpose. He made the amalgam in a concentrated form, and it was added\r\nin various proportions to the mercury used for gold amalgamation. Water\r\nbecoming present, it will readily be understood that the sodium, in\r\nbeing converted into the hydrate (KHO) of that metal, caused a rapid\r\nevolution of hydrogen. The hydrogen thus evolved was the excess over a\r\ncertain proportion which enters into combination with the mercury. While\r\nthe mercury retained the charge of hydrogen, the \"quickness\" of the\r\nfluid metal was preserved; but upon the loss of the hydrogen the\r\n\"quickness\" ceased, and the mercury was acted upon by the injurious\r\ncomponents contained in the ore.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of the sodium amalgam, many attempts have been\r\nmade, more especially in America, to overcome the tendency of mercury to\r\n\"sicken\" and lose its \"quickness.\" The greater number of these efforts\r\nhave been made by the use of electricity as the active agent in\r\nattaining this end; but such efforts have been generally of a crude and\r\nunscientific character. Latterly Mr. Barker, of the Electro-amalgamator\r\nCompany, Limited, has introduced a system--already detailed in these\r\npages--by which the mercury is \"quickened.\" In his method the running\r\nwater passing over the tables, or other apparatus of a similar\r\ncharacter, is used as the electrolyte. In this arrangement, the mercury\r\nbeing the cathode, plates or wires of copper constituting anodes are\r\nbrought into contact with the water passing over the mercury in each\r\n\"riffle.\" Both the cathode and the anodes are, of course, maintained in\r\ncontact with the poles of a suitable source of electrical supply. The\r\ncurrent then passes from the copper anode through the running water\r\nto the mercury cathode, and so on to the negative pole of the\r\nelectro-motor. As a consequence of this arrangement, hydrogen is evolved\r\nfrom the water, and has the effect of reducing any oxide or other\r\ndetrimental compound of the metal; in other words, it \"quickens\" and\r\nprevents \"sickening\" of the fluid metal, and consequent \"flouring\" and\r\nloss. While the hydrogen is evolved at the cathode, oxygen enters into\r\ncombination with the copper constituting the anodes. This to some extent\r\nimpairs the conductivity of the circuit.\r\n\r\nThe latest process, however, is that of Mr. Bernard C. Molloy, M.P.,\r\nwhich we have already characterized as highly scientific and effective,\r\nthe production of a suitable amalgam being obtained under the most\r\neconomical and simple conditions. This process has the advantage of\r\nproducing not only a hydrogen amalgam, but also at will an amalgam of\r\nhydrogen combined with any metal electro-positive to this latter. Thus\r\nhydrogen potassium or hydrogen sodium can be obtained, as will be seen\r\nby the following description.\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy's effort appears to have been, in the first place, directed\r\nto a system which could be adapted to any existing apparatus, and in\r\ncertain cases where water was scarce, to avoid altogether the use of\r\nthat, in some districts, rare commodity. For the purpose of explanation\r\nwe select an ordinary amalgamating table fitted with mercury riffles.\r\nThe surface of the table is in no way interfered with or disturbed. The\r\nbed of the riffle, however, is constructed of some porous material, such\r\nas leather, non-resinous wood, or cement, which serves as the diaphragm\r\nupon which the mercury rests, and separates the fluid metal from the\r\nelectrolyte beneath. Running the full length of the table is a thin\r\nlayer of sand, supported and pressing against the diaphragm, and lying\r\nin this sand is the anode, formed preferably of lead. A peroxide of\r\nthat metal is formed by the action of the currents, and may be readily\r\nreduced for use over and over again after working for from one to three\r\nmonths. The peroxide of lead, as is well known, is a conductor of\r\nelectricity, and this fact constitutes an important advantage in the\r\nworking of the process. The thin layer of sand is saturated with an\r\nelectrolyte, such as dilute sulphuric acid (H_{2}SO_{4} + 20H_{2}O)\r\nto give a simple hydrogen amalgam; (Na_{2}SO_{4} + xH_{2}O) to give a\r\nhydrogen sodium amalgam; or (K_{2}SO_{4} + xH_{2}O) to give a hydrogen\r\npotassium amalgam. Numerous other electrolytes constituted by acids,\r\nalkalies, and salts can be used to form an amalgam permanently\r\nmaintained in a condition of \"quickness\" and freed from all liability\r\nto \"sicken,\" whatever the components of the ore may be. The mercury\r\nis connected with the negative pole of the voltaic battery or other\r\nelectro-motor, and the lead made with the positive pole of the same\r\nsource. When the current passes there is formed according to the nature\r\nof the electrolyte, a hydrogen amalgam, or an amalgam of hydrogen with a\r\nmetal electro-positive to hydrogen. The electrolyte, which, it will be\r\nunderstood, is distinct and apart from the body of water passing over\r\nthe table, will last almost indefinitely, there being no consumption of\r\nany of its constituents, excepting hydrogen and oxygen from the water\r\nof solution. The quantity of acid or saline material contained in the\r\nelectrolyte is so very small that there can be no difficulty in finding\r\na supply in any district. The question of the supply of electricity is\r\none which in many mining districts involves considerations of practical\r\nimportance, since a large supply would necessitate water or steam power.\r\nIt has been found that two cells having an electromotive force of about\r\ntwo volts each will in this process suffice; if preferred, however,\r\na very small dynamo machine can be used. In connection with the\r\nelectro-motive force it is requisite to use, it may be observed that an\r\namalgam of sodium containing only a small quantity of this metal would,\r\nwhen constituting a positive element in conjunction with a lead negative\r\nand on an aqueous electrolyte, give an opposing electro-motive force of\r\nless than three volts. Such an amalgam could therefore be obtained under\r\nan electro-motive force of about four volts. The electrical resistance\r\nin the circuit constituted by the apparatus being very small, no\r\nelectrical power is wasted. When water constitutes the electrolyte, as\r\nin Barker's system, then the electro-motive force required to obtain a\r\ngiven current would be very much greater than that above specified.\r\nThe conditions assured under this process appear to be all that can\r\nbe required, while the amalgams obtained are those most calculated to\r\npreserve the \"quickness\" and prevent the \"sickening\" of the mercury.\r\n\r\nMr. Molloy has designed a special form of amalgamating machine to be\r\nused in conjunction with the above process, and with or without the aid\r\nof water. By the employment of this machine, each particle of the ore\r\nis slowly rolled in the quickened mercury for from fifteen to thirty or\r\nmore seconds.\r\n\r\nWhen the extent of the gold and silver mining industries is considered,\r\nand when it is borne in mind that a considerable percentage of the\r\nprecious metal present in the ore is, in the ordinary process of\r\nextraction, lost through defective amalgamation--due to insufficient\r\ncontact with the mercury or to a total absence of contact, as in the\r\ncase of float gold--it is obvious that the introduction of any system\r\nobviating such loss is a matter of very great importance to those who\r\nare interested in the above mentioned industries. We expect shortly to\r\nhear of the practical introduction on a large scale of Mr. Molloy's\r\nprocess, and we look forward with interest to the results which may be\r\nobtained from it.--_The Engineer_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF ORES BY ELECTROLYSIS.\r\n\r\nBy M. KILIANI.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe author lays down general principles for electrolytic metallurgy.\r\nOres must be distinguished as good and bad conductors; the former\r\nmay serve directly as anodes, and are easily oxidized by the\r\nelectro-negative radicals formed at their contact, and dissolve readily\r\nin the electrolyte. The bad conductors have to be placed in contact\r\nwith a conducting anode, formed of an inoxidizable substance, such as\r\nplatinum, manganese peroxide, or coke. In laboratory experiments a good\r\nconducting ore is electrolyzed by suspension from a platinum wire in\r\nconnection with the source of electricity, and is then immersed in the\r\nbath. On an industrial scale the ore, coarsely broken up, is placed in\r\none of the compartments of a trough divided by a diaphragm.\r\n\r\nOn the fragments of the ore which extend up outside of the electrolytic\r\nbath is laid a plate of copper connected with the positive wire. Care\r\nmust be taken that this plate does not plunge into the bath, otherwise\r\nthe current would not traverse the ore at all. The cathode is preferably\r\nformed of the same metal which is to be obtained. The bath should\r\nnot contain organic acids. In practice the common mineral acids are\r\nemployed, or their salts, selecting by preference a salt of the metal\r\nwhich is to be isolated. It is convenient to pass the current through\r\nthe greatest possible number of small decomposition troughs, taking care\r\nthat the resistance in each is not too great. With a current of one and\r\nthe same intensity we obtain in n troughs n times as much metal as in a\r\nsingle one. To keep down the resistance of the circuit we employ poles\r\nof a large surface, i.e., plenty of ore and baths which are as good\r\nconductors as possible.\r\n\r\nThe state in which the metal is deposited at the negative pole depends\r\non the secondary actions undergone by the electrolyte, and especially of\r\nthe escape of gas. This is a function of the _density_, of the current,\r\ni.e., the proportion of its intensity to the surface of the cathode. If\r\nthe density is too great there is an escape of hydrogen, and the metal\r\nis deposited in a spongy condition. If the density of the current falls\r\nbelow a certain minimum, an oxide is deposited in place of metal. The\r\nelectrolytic treatment of ores often renders it possible to separate\r\nthe different metals which may be present. These are deposited in\r\nsuccession, and are sharply separated if the electromotive power is not\r\ntoo great.\r\n\r\n1. _Zinc_.--The zinciferous compounds--calamine, blende, and zinc\r\nash--are all poor conductors. They are first dissolved, and the salts\r\nobtained are electrolyzed, employing anodes of coke. Blende should be\r\nroasted before it is dissolved. The electrolytic bath should be as\r\nconcentrated as possible to avoid sponginess of the metal and an escape\r\nof hydrogen. In a saturated solution the formation of hydrogen decreases\r\nas the density of the current augments.\r\n\r\n2. _Lead_.--Galena is a good conductor, and may be directly\r\nelectrolyzed. The best bath is a solution of lead nitrate. The\r\narborescent crystallizations extend rapidly, and must be broken from\r\ntime to time to prevent the formation of a metallic connection between\r\nthe anode and the cathode. The sulphur of the galena falls to the bottom\r\nof the bath, and may be separated from the gangue by solution in carbon\r\ndisulphide.\r\n\r\n3. _Copper_.--Native copper sulphide, though a good conductor, cannot\r\nbe directly electrolyzed en account of the presence of iron sulphide,\r\nwhence iron would be deposited along with the copper. The copper pyrites\r\nare roasted, dissolved in dilute sulphuric acid, and the liquid thus\r\nobtained is submitted to electrolysis.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA PEOPLE WITHOUT CONSUMPTION, AND SOME ACCOUNT OF THEIR COUNTRY--THE\r\nCUMBERLAND TABLELAND.\r\n\r\nBy E. M. WIGHT, M.D., Chattanooga, Tenn., Late Professor of Diseases\r\nof the Chest and State Medicine, Medical Department University of\r\nTennessee; Late Member of the Tennessee State Board of Health, and\r\nex-President of the Tennessee State Medical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the ten years that I have practiced medicine in the neighborhood\r\nof the Cumberland Tablelands, I have often heard it said that the\r\npeople on the mountains never had consumption. Occasionally a traveling\r\nnewspaper correspondent from the North found his way down through the\r\nCumberlands, and wrote back filled with admiration for their grandeur,\r\ntheir climate, their healthfulness, and almost invariably stated that\r\nconsumption was never known upon these mountains, excepting brought\r\nthere by some person foreign to the soil, who, if he came soon enough,\r\nusually recovered. Similar information came to me in such a variety of\r\nways and number of instances, that I determined some four years ago,\r\nwhen the attempt to get a State Board of Health organized was first\r\ndiscussed by a few medical men of our State, that I would make an\r\ninvestigation of this matter. These observations have extended over that\r\nwhole time, and have been made with great care and as much accuracy\r\nas possible, and to my own astonishment and delight, I have become\r\nconvinced that pulmonary consumption does not exist among the people\r\nnative and resident to the Tablelands of the Cumberland Mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the performance of the work which has enabled me to arrive at this\r\nconclusion, I have had the generous assistance of more than twenty\r\nphysicians, who have been many years in practice in the vicinity of\r\nthese mountains. Their knowledge of the diseases which had occurred\r\nthere extended over a, period of more than forty years. Some of these\r\nphysicians have reported the knowledge of the occurrence of deaths from\r\nconsumption on the Tablelands, but when carefully inquired into they\r\nhave invariably found that the person dying was not a native of the\r\nmountains, but, a sojourner in search of health. In answer to the\r\nquestion: \"How many cases of pulmonary consumption have you known to\r\noccur on Walden's Ridge, among the people native to the mountains?\"\r\neleven physicians say, \"Not one.\" All of these have been engaged in\r\npractice there more than three years, four of them more than ten years,\r\none of them more than twenty, and one of them more than forty years. All\r\nthe physicians of whom inquiries have been made are now residents, or\r\nhave been, of the valleys contiguous to Walden's Ridge, and know the\r\nmountain people well. Four other physicians in answer to the same\r\nquestion say, that they have known from one to four cases, numbering\r\neleven in all, but had not ascertained whether five of them were born\r\nand raised on the mountains or not. The names and place of death of all\r\nthese cases were given, and I have traced their history and found that\r\nbut three of them were \"natives,\" or had lived there more than five\r\nyears, and that one of these was 57 years of age when she died, and had\r\nsuffered from cancer for three years before her death. The two others\r\ndied within six months after returning home from long service in the\r\narmy, where both contracted their disease.\r\n\r\nAll these investigations have been made with more particular reference\r\nto that part of the Cumberlands known as Walden's Ridge than to the\r\nmountains as a whole. This ridge is of equal elevation and of very\r\nsimilar character to the main Cumberland range in the southern part of\r\nTennessee, northwest Georgia, and northwest Alabama, and what is true of\r\nthis particular part of the great Cumberland table is, in the main, true\r\nof the remainder.\r\n\r\nSequatchee Valley lies between Walden's Ridge and what is commonly known\r\nin that neighborhood as the Cumberland Mountains, and separates it from\r\nthe main range for a distance of about one hundred miles, from the\r\nTennessee River below Chattanooga to Grassy Cove, well up toward the\r\ncenter line of the State. Grassy Cove is a small basin valley, which\r\nwas described to me there as a \"sag in the mountains,\" just above the\r\nSequatchee Valley proper. It is here that the Sequatchee River rises,\r\nand flowing under the belt of hills which unites the ridge and the main\r\nrange, for two miles or more, rises again at the head of Sequatchee\r\nValley. Above Grassy Cove the mountains unite and hold their union\r\nfirmly on their way north as far as our State reaches.\r\n\r\nTopographically considered as a whole, the Cumberland range has its\r\nsouthern terminus in Alabama, and its northern in Pennsylvania. It\r\nis almost wholly composed of coal-bearing rocks, resting on Devonian\r\nstrata, which are visible in many places in the valleys.\r\n\r\nBut a small portion of the Cumberland lies above a plane of 2,000 feet.\r\nWalden's Ridge and Lookout Mountain vary in height from 2,000 to 2,500\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nNorth of Grassy Cove, after the ridges are united, the variation from\r\n2,000 feet is but little throughout the remainder of the State, and\r\nthe general character of the table changes but little. The great and\r\nimportant difference is in the climate, the winters being much more\r\nsevere in these mountains in the northern part of the State than in the\r\nsouthern, and the summers much more liable to sudden changes of weather.\r\nScott, Fentress, and Morgan counties comprise this portion of the table,\r\nand these have not been included in my examination, excepting as to\r\ngeneral features.\r\n\r\nIn all our southern country, and I may say in our whole country, there\r\nis no other large extent of elevated territory which offers mankind\r\na pleasant living place, a comfortable climate--none too cold or too\r\nhot--and productive lands. We have east of the upper waters of the great\r\nTennessee River, in our State, and in North Carolina and Georgia, the\r\ngreat Blue Ridge range of mountains, known as the Unaka, or Smoky,\r\nChilhowee, Great and Little Frog, Nantahala, etc., all belonging to the\r\nsame family of hills. This chain has the same general course as the\r\nCumberlands. It is a much bolder range of mountains, but it is vastly\r\nless inhabitable, productive, or convenient of access. The winters there\r\nare severely cold, and the nights in summer are too cold and damp for\r\nhealth and comfort, as I know by personal experience of two summers on\r\nNantahala River. But the trout fishing is beyond comparison, and that\r\nis one inducement of great value for a stout consumptive _who is a good\r\nfellow_. These mountains are much more broken up into branches, peaks,\r\nand spurs than the Cumberlands. They afford no table terrritory of\r\nany extent. There are some excellent places there for hot summer\r\nvisits--Ashville, Warm Springs, Franklin, and others.\r\n\r\nThe Cumberland Mountains, as a whole, are flat, in broad level spaces,\r\nbroken only by the \"divides,\" or \"gulfs,\" as they are called by the\r\ninhabitants, where the streams flow out into the valleys.\r\n\r\nWalden's Ridge, of which we come now to speak particularly, is the best\r\nlocated of any part of the Cumberlands as a place for living. From the\r\nseparation of this ridge from the main range of Grassy Cove to its\r\nsouthern terminus at the Tennessee River, it maintains a remarkably\r\nuniform character in every particular. From it access to commerce is\r\neasy, having the Tennessee River and the new (now building) Cincinnati\r\nSouthern Railroad skirting its entire length on the east. It rises very\r\nabruptly from both the Tennessee and Sequatchee Valleys, being from\r\n1,200 to 1,500 feet higher than the valleys on each side. Looking from\r\nbelow, on the Tennessee Valley side, the whole extent of the ridge\r\nappears securely walled in at the top by a continuous perpendicular wall\r\nof sandstone, from 100 to 200 feet high; and from the Sequatchee side\r\nthe appearance is very similar, excepting that the wall is not so\r\ncontinuous, and of less height.\r\n\r\nThe top of the ridge is one level stretch of plain, broken only by the\r\n\"gulfs\" before mentioned and an occasional prominent sandstone wall or\r\nbowlder. The width on top is, I should judge, 6 or 7 miles. The soil is\r\nof uniform character, light, sandy, and less productive for the ordinary\r\ncrops of the Tennessee farmer than the soil of the lowlands. The grape,\r\napple, and potato grow to perfection, better than in the valleys, and\r\nare all never failing crops; so with rye and buckwheat. Corn grows\r\nwell, very well in selected spots, and where the land is made rich\r\nby cultivation. The grasses are rich and luxuriant, even in the wild\r\nforests, and when cultivated, the appearance is that of the rich farms\r\nof the Ohio or Connecticut Rivers, only here they are green and growing\r\nthe greater part of the year; so much so that sheep, and in the mild\r\nwinters the young cattle, live by the wild grasses of the forests the\r\nwhole year. The great stock raisers of the Sequatchee and Tennessee\r\nValleys make this the summer pasture for their cattle, and drive them to\r\ntheir own farms and barns or to market in winter. The whole Cumberland\r\ntable, with the exception of that small part which is under cultivation,\r\nis one great free, open pasture for all the cattle of the valleys.\r\nThousands of cattle graze there whose owners never pay a dollar for\r\npasturage or own an acre of the range, though, as a rule, most of the\r\nwell-to-do stock farmers in the valleys own more or less mountain lands.\r\nThese lands have, until quite recently, been begging purchasers at from\r\n12½ to 25 cents per acre in large tracts of 10,000 acres and upward, and\r\nperhaps the same could be said of the present time, leaving out choice\r\ntracts and easily accessible places, which are held at from 50 cents to\r\n$2 per acre, wooded virgin lands.\r\n\r\nThe forest growth of Walden's Ridge is almost entirely oak and chestnut.\r\nHickory, perhaps, comes next in frequency, and pine after. There is but\r\nlittle undergrowth, and where the forests have never been molested there\r\nare but few small trees. This is due to the annual fires which occur\r\nevery autumn, or some time in winter, almost without exception, and\r\noverrun the whole ridge. It does not rage like a prairie fire. Its\r\nprogress is usually slow, the material consumed being only the dry\r\nforest leaves and grasses. The one thing essential to its progress is\r\nthese dry leaves, hence it cannot march into the clearings. Nearly all\r\nthe small shrubs are killed by these fires, otherwise they are harmless,\r\nand are greatly valued by the stock men for the help they render in the\r\ngrowth of the wild grasses. The free circulation of air through these\r\ngreat unbroken forests is certainly much facilitated by these fires,\r\nsince they destroy every year what would soon become impediments. The\r\ndestruction of this undergrowth leaves the woods open, and the lands are\r\nmainly so level that a carriage may be driven for miles, regardless of\r\nroads, through the forests in every direction.\r\n\r\nThe shrubs about the fields and places where the forests have\r\nbeen interrupted by civilization and other causes are blackberry,\r\nhuckleberry, raspberry, sumac, and their usual neighbors, with the\r\nazalia, laurel, and rhododendron on the slopes and in the shade of the\r\ncliffs.\r\n\r\nThe kinds of wild grasses, I regret to say, I have not noted, and the\r\nsame of the rich and varied display of wild flowers.\r\n\r\nThe whole ridge is well supplied with clean, soft running water, even\r\nin the driest of the season. There are no marshes, swamps, or bogs, no\r\nstill water--not even a \"puddle\" for long--for the soil is of such a\r\ncharacter, that surface water quickly filters away into the sands and\r\nmingles with the streams in the gulfs. Springs of mineral water are\r\nabundant everywhere. Probably there is not a square mile of Walden's\r\nRidge which does not furnish chalybeate water abundantly. Sulphur\r\nsprings with Epsom salts in combination are nearly as common.\r\n\r\nThe entire extent of Walden's Ridge is underlaid with veins of coal, and\r\niron ore is plentiful, especially in the foot hills. The coal and iron\r\nare successfully mined in many places on the eastern slope; on the\r\nwestern they are nearly untouched for the want of transportation. I find\r\nthat the impression prevails that the minerals of the Cumberlands are\r\nlargely controlled by land agents and speculators. This is only true as\r\napplied to a very small part of the whole, not more than 1 per cent. The\r\nmineral ownership remains with the lands almost entirely.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing winds on Walden's Ridge are from the southwest; northers\r\nand northeasters are of rare occurrence. One old lady who had resided\r\nthere for forty years, in answer to my query upon this subject, said:\r\n\"Nine days out of ten, the year round, I can smell Alabama in the air.\"\r\nThis was the usual testimony of the residents. Winds of great velocity\r\nnever occur there. In summer there is always an evening breeze,\r\ncommencing at 4 to 6 o'clock, and continuing until after sunrise\r\nthe next morning. In times of rain, clouds hang low over the ridge\r\noccasionally, but they never have fogs there.\r\n\r\nThe range of the thermometer is less on the Tablelands than in the\r\nadjacent valleys. I have had access to the carefully taken observations\r\nof the Lookout Mountain Educational Institute, such published accounts\r\nas have been made by Professor Safford, State Geologist, Mr. Killebrew,\r\nthe thorough and painstaking private record of Captain John P. Long,\r\nof Chattanooga, and many more of less length of time. From all these I\r\ndeduce the fact that the summer days are seven or eight degrees cooler\r\non the mountains than in the Tennessee Valley at Chattanooga, and five\r\nor six degrees cooler than in the Sequatchee Valley, as far up as Dunlay\r\nand Pikeville. The nights on the table are cooler than in the lower\r\nlands by several more degrees than the days; how much I have thus far\r\nnot been able to state. The late fall months, the winter, and early\r\nspring are not so much colder than the valleys as the summer months, the\r\ndifference between the average temperature of the mountains and valleys\r\nbeing at that time four or five degrees less than in the summer. There\r\nis no record of so hot a day ever having occurred on the Cumberladd\r\nMountains as to cause mercury to run so high as 95° F., or so cold a day\r\nas to cause it to run so low as 10° below zero.\r\n\r\nIn the average winter the ground rarely freezes to a greater depth than\r\n2 or 3 inches, and it remains frozen but a few days at a time. Ice has\r\nbeen known to form 8 inches thick, but in ordinary winters, 3 or 4\r\nis the maximum. Snow falls every winter, more or less, and sometimes\r\nremains for a week. Old people have a remembrance of a foot of snow\r\nwhich lasted for a week.\r\n\r\nWalden's Ridge has a total population of a little more than 4,000,\r\nscattered over 600 square miles of surface. The number of dwellings is\r\nabout 800. Ninety per cent. of these are log houses; 70 per cent. of\r\nthem are without glass windows; light being furnished through the\r\ndoorways, always open in the daytime, the shuttered window openings, and\r\nthe open spaces between the logs of the walls. Less than 2 per cent. of\r\nthese houses have plastered walls or ceilings, and less than 5 per cent.\r\nhave ceiled walls or ceilings. About 20 per cent. of them are fairly\r\nwell chinked with clay between the logs, the remainder being but\r\nindifferently built in that particular. Fully 90 per cent. of these\r\nabodes admit of free access of air at all times of day and night,\r\nthrough the floors beneath as well as the walls and roof above. It is\r\nthe custom of the people to guard against the coldest of days and nights\r\nby hanging bed clothes against the walls, and many good housewives have\r\na supply of tidy drapery which they keep alone for this purpose.\r\n\r\nWood, always at hand, is the only fuel in use. The whole heating\r\napparatus consists in one large open fireplace, built of stone,\r\ncommunicating with a large chimney outside the house at one end, and\r\nfrequently scarcely as high as the one story building which supports it.\r\nThis chimney is constructed in such a manner as to be a great ventilator\r\nof the whole room, quite sufficient, it would be thought, if there were\r\nno other means of ventilation. It is usually made of stone at the\r\nbase, and that part above the fire is of sticks laid upon one another,\r\ncobhouse fashion, and plastered over inside and between with similar\r\nclay as that with which the house walls are chinked.\r\n\r\nVery few of these houses are more than one story high. They are all\r\ncovered with long split oak shingles--the people there call them\r\n\"boards\"--rifted from the trunks of selected trees. There is no\r\nsheathing on the roof beneath these shingles. They are nailed down upon\r\nthe flat hewn poles running across the rafters, at convenient distances.\r\nLooking up through the many openings in the roof in one of these house,\r\none would think that this would be but poor protection against rain, but\r\nthey rarely leak.\r\n\r\nNot one family in fifty is provided with a cooking stove. They bake\r\ntheir bread in flat iron kettles, with iron covers, covered with hot\r\ncoals and ashes. These they call ovens. The meat is fried, with only the\r\nexception of when accompanied by \"turnip greens.\"\r\n\r\nThe question, \"What is the principal food of the people who live on\r\nthese mountains?\" has been asked by me several hundred times. The\r\nalmost invariable answer has been, \"Corn bread, bacon, and coffee.\"\r\nOccasionally biscuits and game have been mentioned in the answers. All\r\nfood is eaten hot. Coffee is usually an accompaniment of all three\r\nmeals, and is drunk without cream and often without sugar. Some families\r\neat beef and mutton for one or two of the colder months in the year on\r\nrare occasions, though beef is commonly considered \"onfit to go\r\nupon,\" as I was told upon several occasions, and mutton sustains less\r\nreputation. Chickens are used for food while they are young and tender\r\nenough to fry, on occasions of quarterly meetings, visits of \"kinfolks\"\r\nor the \"preachers\" and the traveling doctors. Fat young lambs are plenty\r\nin many settlements from March to October, and can be had at fifty cents\r\neach, but I could not learn that one was ever eaten.\r\n\r\nA large majority of the adult population use tobacco in some shape--the\r\nmen by chewing or smoking, the women by smoking or dipping snuff. They\r\nnever have dyspepsia, nor do they ever get flesh, after they pass out of\r\nchildhood, though nearly all the children are ruddy in appearance, and\r\nwell rounded with fat.\r\n\r\nOne physical type prevails among the people in middle life, and carries\r\nalong into old age but little change; and old age is common there.\r\nNearly every house has its old man or old woman, or both. Everybody,\r\nfather and mother, and frequently grandfather and grandmother, is still\r\non hand, looking as brisk and moving about as lively as the newer\r\ngenerations. After they pass their forty years, they never seem to\r\ngrow any older for the next twenty or thirty, and the grandfathers and\r\ngrandmothers can scarcely be selected, by comparison, from their own\r\nchildren and grandchildren. The men are taller than the average, and\r\nthe women, relatively, taller than the men. They are all thin featured,\r\nbright eyed, long haired, sharp looking people, with every appearance of\r\nstrength and power of endurance.\r\n\r\nI think the men who live on Walden's Ridge can safely challenge the\r\nworld as walkers--aborigines and all; and unless the challenge should be\r\naccepted by their own women folks, I feel quite sure they would \"win the\r\nboots.\" They go everywhere on foot, and never seem to tire.\r\n\r\nNearly all the people of the Tablelands are employed in the pursuits of\r\nagriculture. Very few of them seem to be hard workers. The men are all\r\ngreat lovers of the forest sports, much given to the good, reliable, old\r\nfashioned long rifles. The women and children are much employed in out\r\ndoor occupations, and live a great portion of their time in the open\r\nair. The clothing of all classes is scanty. The use of woolen fabrics\r\nfor underwear has not yet been introduced, and coarse cotton domestic\r\nis the universal shirting, and cotton jeans, or cotton and wool mixed,\r\nconstitute the staple for outer wearing apparel. The men wear shoes\r\nthroughout the year much more commonly than boots. They never wear\r\ngloves, mittens, scarfs, or overcoats, and they scorn umbrellas.\r\nProbably this whole 4,000 people do not possess two dozen umbrellas or\r\ntwice as many overcoats. The women go about home with bare feet a great\r\npart of the summer. They never wear corsets or other lacing.\r\n\r\nI have learned by careful inquiry that very few of the people of the\r\nRidge have ever had the diseases of childhood. Scarlet fever I could\r\nhear of in but two places, and I suppose that not one person in fifty\r\nhas had it. Whooping cough and measles have occurred but rarely, and the\r\nlarge majority have not yet experienced the realities of either. Very\r\nfew people there have ever been vaccinated, nor has smallpox ever\r\nprevailed. Typhoid, typhus, and intermittent fevers are unknown. In the\r\ngreat rage of typhoid fever which took place ten or twelve years ago in\r\nthe Tennessee and Sequatchee Valleys, not a single case occurred on the\r\nMountains, as I have been informed by physicians who were engaged in\r\npractice in the neighborhood at the time. Diphtheria has never found a\r\nvictim there; so of croup. Nobody has nasal catarrh there, and a cough\r\nor a cold is exceedingly rare.\r\n\r\nI have said that these observations refer more particularly to Walden's\r\nRidge than to the Cumberland Tablelands in our State as a whole. This\r\nridge was chosen by me for this examination, mainly for the reason of\r\nits convenience, but partly owing to its being more generally settled\r\nthan any other equal portion of the table which lies in Tennessee.\r\nLookout Mountain is not as well located; it is on the wrong side of the\r\nTennessee River, and but a few acres of it belong in this State. Sand\r\nMountain is altogether out of the State, but it is perhaps nearer like\r\nWalden's Ridge in its physical features than Lookout. That part of the\r\nCumberlands west of Sequatchee Valley is Walden's Ridge in duplicate,\r\nexcepting that it is further west, and nearer the Middle Tennessee\r\nbasin. There are some small towns, villages of miners, and summer\r\nresorts there, which interferes with that evenness of the distribution\r\nof population which Walden's Ridge has, rendering it more liable to\r\nvisitations of epidemic and contagious diseases. The tablelands north\r\nof the center line of the State, above Grassy Cove, are very similar\r\nto Walden's Ridge, as far up as Kentucky, with the exception before\r\nmentioned--that of climate--it being from one to ten degrees colder in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThis whole Cumberland Table is no small country. It comprises territory\r\nenough to make a good sized State. At present, it is almost one great\r\nwilderness, in many particulars as unknown as the Black Hills. It is\r\ncoming into the world now, and will be well known in a few years. The\r\ngreat city of Cincinnati has determined to build a railroad through\r\nthe very center of this great table in the north part of the State,\r\nconnecting with Chattanooga in the southern part. This road is nearly\r\nbored through, and in another year or two the Cumberland Tablelands in\r\nTennessee will be much heard of at home and abroad.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me this country has merits. It is located in the latitude of\r\nmild climate; not so far south as to be scorched by the hot summer sun,\r\nor visited by the great life destroying epidemics; not so far north as\r\nto meet the severe and lengthened winters.\r\n\r\nClimate, we know, is a fixture; it has a government; it has rules; the\r\nweather may change, but climate does not; it is a permanent out-door\r\naffair, and what is true of to-day was true centuries ago, and will\r\nbe true forever, in the measure of any practical scope, at least. The\r\npeople of the world are beginning to know that the greatest destroyer of\r\nhuman life has its remedy in climate.\r\n\r\nMr. Lombard, in his famous exhibit in relation to the prevalence of\r\nconsumption among the people of different occupations, circumstances of\r\nlife, and place of dwelling, gives the lowest number of deaths from this\r\ncause to those who live in the open air. He found the people who lived\r\nmost in the open air, as would be readily conjectured, in the mild\r\nlatitudes, not in the countries of hot sands or cold snows.\r\n\r\n[The above article, in regard to which we have noticed frequent\r\nallusions in many of our exchanges, all erroneously attributing it to\r\n_Dr. Wright_, of Tennessee, and for which we have received repeated\r\nrequests quite recently, was read by the lamented Dr. E.M. Wight at\r\nthe 43d annual meeting of the Tennessee State Medical Society, held\r\nat Nashville, April 4, 5, and 6, 1876. Its distinguished and talented\r\nauthor will long be remembered as one of the most active, earnest, and\r\nzealous members of the State Society. At this meeting he also read a\r\nvery admirable paper on \"The Microscopic Appearance of the Blood in\r\nSyphilis,\" and prepared the report of the Committee on State Board\r\nof Health, to which report may be ascribed the honor of securing the\r\nnecessary legislation organizing the Board. A true, upright, honest man,\r\nan earnest, devoted and zealous physician, universally esteemed and\r\nbeloved by all who knew him; himself the subject of tuberculosis, dying\r\nin the prime of a brilliant manhood. He had but few equals in the\r\nglorious profession he honored and loved so well.\r\n\r\nFrom a careful reading of his paper, we find that he describes a large\r\narea of territory, free, absolutely free, from subsoil moisture, a\r\nclimate mild and equable, a soil capable of producing nearly everything\r\nnecessary for the comfortable maintenance of human life, surroundings\r\nthat tempt, nay, compel the greatest possible amount of open air\r\nlife. His description is exceedingly accurate of a plain, primitive,\r\nsimple-minded people with but few wants, many of the virtues and few\r\nof the vices of humanity. With their surroundings, soil, climate,\r\nresidence, and mode of living, need we be surprised that \"there is\r\na people,\" or a land \"free from consumption\"?--ED.]--_Southern\r\nPractitioner_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TREATMENT OF HABITUAL CONSTIPATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. F.P. Atkinson thus writes in the _Practitioner_, January, 1884: I\r\nsuppose there is no derangement of the system we are more frequently\r\ncalled upon to treat than habitual constipation; and though all kinds of\r\nmedicines are suggested for its relief, they rarely produce more than\r\ntemporary benefit--and it is difficult to see how the result can well be\r\notherwise, while the root of the evil remains untouched. Now by far the\r\nmore numerous subjects of this disorder are women; and as they do not\r\nseem to know that regularity is essential to the performance of every\r\none of nature's operations, they appoint no stated times for trying to\r\nget the bowels relieved, but trust to receiving intimation when the\r\nrectal accumulation and distension can be borne no longer. This method\r\nof action may and does answer fairly well for a time; but nature\r\ngradually gets upset, the sensation of the lower bowel becomes blunted,\r\nand at last it ceases to respond to the ordinary stimulus. Then\r\naperients are regularly resorted to, and although these act fairly\r\nwell for a time, they gradually have to be increased in strength\r\nand frequency. Now, as regards the treatment, the first thing to be\r\naccomplished is of course to get the rectum well relieved; the next,\r\nto get the actions to take place at fixed times; and lastly, it is\r\nnecessary to get more tone imparted to the muscular tissue of the\r\nbowels, so that the regularity of action may be helped and also\r\nmaintained. In order, then, to get the bowels relieved in the first\r\ninstance, it is well to give five grains of both compound colocynth and\r\ncompound rhubarb pill at bed-time (this rarely requires to be repeated),\r\nthen to take a tumblerful of cold water the next morning on waking, and\r\nrepeat it regularly at the same time each day. Should the bowels remain\r\nsluggish for some time, the same quantity of water may be taken daily\r\nbefore each meal. Supposing no action takes place on rising or shortly\r\nafter, a small injection of warm water may be resorted to. After each\r\nmovement of the bowels, a small hand-ball syringeful of _cold_ water\r\nshould be thrown into the rectum and retained. A soup plateful of coarse\r\noatmeal porridge (made with water and taken according to the Scotch\r\nmethod, viz., by filling half the spoon with the hot porridge and the\r\nother with cold milk) each night at bed-time, or even every night and\r\nmorning for a time, is often a very great help. But above all things,\r\nit is necessary for the patient to _try_ and get relief at a certain\r\n_fixed_ time regularly every day. If these directions are strictly\r\ncarried out in their entirety, the evil, even if it has been of long\r\nstanding, will generally be corrected, and the patient will improve in\r\nhealth and appearance. Of course where the constipation results from\r\nexhaustion of the nervous system (such, for instance, as is brought\r\nabout by self-abuse), the special cause has to be taken into\r\nconsideration, and such treatment adopted as is suited to the particular\r\nnecessities of the case.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PYRAMIDS OF MEROE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout fifty miles from the mouth of the Atbara, and, of course, on the\r\neastern bank of the Nile, stand the pyramids of Meroe. They consist\r\nof three groups, and there are, in all, about eighty pyramids. The\r\npresumption is that they represent the old sepulchers of the kings of\r\nMeroe. Candance, Queen of the Ethiopians, mentioned in Acts, chap.\r\nviii., v. 27, is supposed to have belonged to Meroe, that being the name\r\nalso of the capital, which is understood to have been somewhere not far\r\ndistant from the sepulchers. These pyramids of Meroe possess one marked\r\nfeature, distinguishing them from the pyramids of Egypt proper--that is,\r\nthey have an external doorway or porch. As there is no entrance to the\r\npyramid at these porticoes, it is quite possible that they were temples\r\nfor worship or making offerings to the dead. By comparing them with\r\nthe pyramids of Ghizeh, it will be seen that they are also taller in\r\nproportion to their base. Another important point in these porches\r\nor temples is the existence of the arch; and that, too, an arch in\r\nprinciple, with a keystone.--_Illustrated London News_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PYRAMIDS OF MEROE, ON THE NILE.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROLIFICNESS OF THE OYSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an article by Prof. Karl Mobius on \"The Oyster and Oyster Culture,\"\r\nreproduced in the recently issued report of the U. S. Commissioner of\r\nFish and Fisheries, the author says:\r\n\r\nA mature egg-bearing oyster lays about one million of eggs, so that\r\nduring the breeding season there are upon our oyster beds at least\r\n2,200,000,000,000 young oysters, which surely would suffice to transform\r\nthe entire extent of the sea-flats into an unbroken oyster bed; for if\r\nsuch a number of young oysters should be distributed over a surface 74\r\nkilometers long by 22 broad, 1,351 oysters would be allotted to every\r\nsquare meter. But this sum of 2,200,000,000,000 young oysters is\r\nundoubtedly less than that in reality hatched out, for not only do those\r\nfull-grown oysters which are over six years of age spawn, but they begin\r\nto propagate during their second or third year, although it is true that\r\nthe young ones have fewer eggs than those which are fully developed. At\r\na very moderate estimation, the total number of three to six year old\r\noysters which lie upon our beds will produce three hundred billions of\r\neggs. This number added to that produced by the five millions of full\r\ngrown oysters would give for every square meter of surface not merely\r\n1,351 young oysters, but at least 1,535. In order to determine how\r\nmany eggs oysters produce, they must be examined during their spawning\r\nseason. This begins upon the Schleswig-Holstein beds in the middle of\r\nJune, and lasts until the end of August or beginning of September. The\r\nspawning oyster does not allow its ripe eggs to fall into the water, as\r\ndo many other mollusks, but retains them in the so-called beard, the\r\nmantle, and gill-plates until they become little swimming animals. The\r\neggs are white, and cover the mantle and gill-plates as a semi-fluid,\r\ncream-like mass. As soon as they leave the generative organs the\r\ndevelopment of the germ begins. The entire yolk-mass of the egg divides\r\ninto cells, and these cells form a hollow, sphere-like body, in which an\r\nintestinal canal arises by the invagination of one side. Very soon the\r\nbeginnings of the shell appear along the right and left sides of the\r\nback of the embryo, and not long afterward a ciliated pad, the velum, is\r\nformed along the under side. This velum can be thrust out from between\r\nthe valves of the shell at the will of the young animal, and used by the\r\nmotion of its cilia as an organ for driving food to the mouth, or\r\nin swimming as a rudder. During these transformations the original\r\ncream-white color of the germ changes into pale gray, and finally into a\r\ndeep bluish-gray color. At this time they have a long oval outline, and\r\nare from 0.15 to 0.18 of a millimeter in breadth. Over 300,000 can find\r\nroom upon a square centimeter of surface. If an oyster in which the\r\nembryos are in this condition is opened, there will be found upon its\r\nbeard a slimy coating thickly loaded with grayish-blue granules. These\r\ngranules are the embryo oysters, if a drop of the granular slime be\r\nplaced in a dish with pure sea water, the young animals will soon\r\nseparate from the mass, and spread swimming through the entire water.\r\nWhen the embryos are at this stage their number may be estimated in the\r\nfollowing manner: The whole mass of embryos is carefully scraped from\r\nthe beard of the mother oyster by means of a small hair brush. The whole\r\nmass is then weighed, and afterward a small portion of the mass. This\r\nsmall portion is then diluted with water or spirits of wine, and the\r\nembryos portioned out into a number of small glass dishes, so that they\r\ncan be placed under the microscope and counted. Thus, knowing the weight\r\nof the small portion and the number of embryos in it by count, we can\r\nestimate the total number of embryos from the weight of the entire mass,\r\nwhich is also known. In this manner I estimated the number of embryos\r\nin each of five full grown Schleswig-Holstein oysters caught in August,\r\n1869, and found that the average number was 1,012,956.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this great fecundity, but an extremely small proportion\r\nof the young oysters produced during the course of the summer arrive\r\nat maturity, 421 only out of 500,000,000 escaping destruction. The\r\nimmolation of a vast number of young germs is the means by which nature\r\nsecures to a few germs the certainty of arriving at maturity. In order\r\nto render the ideas of germ-fecundity and productiveness more easily\r\nunderstood, Prof. Mobius makes the following comparison between the\r\noyster and man:\r\n\r\nAccording to Wappaus, for every 1,000 men there are 347 births.\r\nAccording to Bockh, out of every 1,000 men born 554 arrive at maturity,\r\nthat is, live to be twenty years or more of age; thus, on an average,\r\n347 children are produced from 554 mature men, or 626 children from\r\n1,000 mature men. Since 1,000 full-grown oysters produce 440,000,000 of\r\ngerms, then the germ fecundity of the oyster is to the germ fecundity of\r\nman as 440,000,000 to 6.26, or as 7,028,754 to 1. On the other hand, the\r\nnumber which arrive at maturity is 579,002 times as great with mankind\r\nas with the oyster; for of 1,000 human embryos brought into the world\r\n554 arrive at maturity, or of 440,000,000 newly born 243,760,000 would\r\nlive to grow up, while of 440,000,000 young oysters only 421 ever become\r\ncapable of propagating their species. The proportion is then 421 to\r\n243,760,000, or as 1 to 579,002. I am fully persuaded that these figures\r\nrepresent the number of oysters which arrive at maturity more favorably\r\nthan is really the case, since from every thousand of full grown oysters\r\nit is certain that, on an average, more than 440,000,000 young are\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED SKY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe beautiful red sky which has been so frequent of late, morning as\r\nwell as evening, has excited much comment. The comment, however, has\r\nconsisted more of description, statement of fact, theory, and wonder as\r\nto cause, rather than as to satisfactory explanation.\r\n\r\nFacts in the case which would reveal the secret of this beautiful\r\ndisplay of nature are not complete and numerous enough at present to\r\nestablish the cause of this phenomenon on a sure basis; yet enough\r\nfacts, it would seem, have been obtained to satisfy the strong mind\r\ncapable of bridging over a wide expanse.\r\n\r\nFacts in an argument are like piers to a bridge-the more we have of\r\nthem, c. p., the more substantial the structure. When the facts are\r\n_legion_, the structure becomes a causeway, and there is no need of\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nArgument is a bridge--the fewer the facts, the more the necessity for\r\nthe bridge; the less the facts, the more argument necessary to connect\r\nthe few we have, and the more skill is required to make substantial\r\nconnecting links between the few solid piers (facts) that exist.\r\n\r\nOne of the queer things in connection with this is, the public have\r\nlooked chiefly, if not wholly, to the astronomers for an explanation\r\nof this phenomenon, when it is not their special province to explain\r\nmatters in this department of nature.\r\n\r\nThe explanation belongs to the department of meteorology, and not to\r\nastronomy. But the fact of having looked to the astronomers shows how\r\nlittle the world knows of meteorology and how few meteorologists\r\nthere are able, ready, and willing to rise and explain in face of the\r\nopposition of the public, who seem to think that the explanation must\r\nnecessarily belong to astronomy. Astronomy proper deals with the\r\nposition of the earth in space and its relation to the other heavenly\r\nbodies, whether suns, fixed stars, planets, satellites, comets, or other\r\nbodies in the vast space about us. Meteorology deals with the atmosphere\r\nof the globe, in all its forms. Astronomy could be studied in the early\r\nages; its grand facts were not wholly dependent upon the advanced\r\ncondition of the mechanic arts; it could be studied even without the aid\r\nof telescopes, though telescopes have added much to its advancement.\r\nMeteorology, on the contrary, depended on the advancement of the arts\r\nand sciences; they must first be perfected ere we could know much about\r\nthis branch of science. To one unfamiliar with the advancement and\r\nperfection of meteorology within the past ten years, this statement\r\nmay seem strange, yet it is an undisputable fact that, prior to the\r\nestablishment of the daily weather reports, the knowledge on this\r\nsubject amounted to very little, and was not even worthy of being\r\ndesignated a science. Prior to the advent of the weather map the world\r\nwas in absolute ignorance of the laws governing the atmosphere. Sure, we\r\nhad had large volumes on the laws of storms, but the later revelations\r\nleave them shelved high and dry on the shores and as useless as a wreck\r\nin a similar condition; with the daily weather map before us we have no\r\nneed to even open these huge volumes; they are completely circumvented,\r\nand only negative in value--to show how little was known of the subject\r\nwithout the full and complete facts daily collected and spread before us\r\non the map published by the Weather Bureau.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the color of our sky, we must understand the\r\nsubject which is so immediately connected with it and its creation.\r\n\r\nThe earth is a sphere in space; generally speaking, it is composed of\r\nland and water. These are two factors; the heat that it derives from\r\nthe sun forms a third factor; the three--land, water, and heat--are\r\nessential to life, at least the higher conditions of life which\r\nculminate in man. The old physical geography taught us this much, but\r\nit was not able to go further and tell us why it was cold or warm\r\nindependent of the seasons; it could not explain why it was at times as\r\nwarm, and even warmer, half-way to the pole than at the equator; why it\r\nwas at times very warm in the extreme northeast while very cold in\r\nthe Southern States; cold in the northwest when it was warm in the\r\nnortheast, and warm in the northwest when cold all along the upper\r\nAtlantic seaboard; it could not forewarn us of storms. These and a\r\nhost of other facts, which the weather map makes as plain as astronomy\r\ndemonstrates that Jupiter is a planet, the new revelation, through the\r\ninstrumentality of the perfected telegraph system, makes exceedingly\r\nplain to us if we will but seek the easily obtained information.\r\n\r\nThe principal revelations of the weather map are the facts in regard to\r\nthe areas of high and low barometer, and the influence they exert upon\r\nthe climate of the globe.\r\n\r\nThese conditions--high and low barometer--move on general lines from the\r\nwest towards the east, or towards the rising sun, and around the world\r\nin irregular belts. The centers of low barometer are various distances\r\napart, from a thousand to two thousand and even more miles apart--call\r\nthe average about two thousand miles.\r\n\r\nThe clouds are formed from the moisture present by the action of the\r\nsun's heat. The direction of the wind is from the area of high barometer\r\nto that of low. The nearer the winds approach the center of \"low\" (low\r\nbarometer), the more they partake of the lines of the volute curve, or\r\ncurve of the sea shell or water in a whirlpool. High barometer is the\r\natmospheric hill; low barometer is the atmospheric valley. But time at\r\npresent will not permit more than these general statements; a close\r\nstudy of the weather map for a season will reveal the beautiful minor\r\ndetails.\r\n\r\nTo the reader it may seem a long way round, yet in order to fully\r\nunderstand the nature of the atmosphere which surrounds our globe we\r\nmust pay due attention to these newly discovered physical laws.\r\n\r\nThe red sky which was so noticeable, in the fall of 1883, the\r\nastronomers have told us was due to \"meteoric dust\" which was produced\r\nby the volcanic eruption on the island of Java, August 27, 1883.\r\n\r\nThis \"meteoric dust\" they say combined with the atmosphere, followed it\r\naround the earth, and caused the beautiful redness of the sky at morning\r\nand evening. For one, I do not believe dust of any description in the\r\natmosphere would produce such an effect.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing luminous, transparent, or delicate about dust. Dust\r\nwould not remain in the atmosphere for months, it would settle in a very\r\nshort time, and if thick enough in the atmosphere to obstruct the light\r\nof the sun it would be visible, discernible, to the eye, and manifest\r\non the face of nature. Years ago, before the age of the weather map, we\r\nmight have thought that the atmosphere followed the surface of the earth\r\nlike the water on a grindstone, but it does not. As already seen, the\r\nwind is from the area of high barometer to that of low, and there are\r\nmany of these \"low centers.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the best calculation we can make at present, there would be at\r\nleast some six centers on an average between the center of the United\r\nStates and the island of Java. In addition to this there would also be\r\na number of belts of \"low\" centers, which would complicate the thing\r\nthreefold at least. At all these different centers the winds would be\r\nblowing from all points of the compass at the same time. Such winds\r\nwould not be apt to bring the \"meteoric dust\" from Java to the United\r\nStates, either in an easterly or westerly direction. But, it is said,\r\n\"dust\" has been gathered.\r\n\r\nHow high from the surface of the ground has this _dust_ been\r\ngathered--at what elevation?\r\n\r\nThere is undoubtedly a little dust in the air most of the time, but I do\r\nnot think that it extends very high. Where it would be the highest and\r\nmost perceptible would be on the arid plans of Africa and Asia, when\r\nthe _simoom_ is passing, or in the track of a tornado. But from the\r\nmultiplicity of these storm centers and the varied winds they would\r\nproduce even this dust could not travel from Java to America.\r\n\r\nAgain, all clouds, no matter how high or how low, are affected by the\r\nlow centers, as the movement of clouds prove, and travel from the \"high\"\r\nto the \"low,\" from and to all points of the compass. High authority\r\ngives the heights of the clouds as follows: lower clouds, 16,000 feet;\r\nupper clouds, 23,000 feet.\r\n\r\nAs all clouds, from the highest to the lowest, are affected by the\r\ncenters as above referred to, it follows that if this \"meteoric dust\"\r\nfollows the earth around, as it would have to do in order to make good\r\nthis theory, it would have to travel suspended in the atmosphere above\r\nthe upper clouds, or at a height of more than 23,000 feet, or at an\r\nelevation of over four miles!\r\n\r\nNow, is it reasonable to believe that dust, however fine, will remain in\r\nthe atmosphere at that elevation for over six months?\r\n\r\nAs a side argument it is suggested that the smoke of the burning woods,\r\nor few years ago in Michigan, caused as peculiar condition of the\r\natmosphere. This extensive fire was on a day when the area of low\r\nbarometer was on a high line of latitude and passing to the eastward.\r\nThis naturally took the smoke, which is far lighter than dust, along\r\nwith it. It mingled with the muggy condition of an extensive \"low,\" and\r\nproduced a yellowness of the atmosphere. This however was of only a few\r\nhours' duration, and was only visible in favorable localities.\r\n\r\nHere again we see the advantage of the weather maps; but for this map we\r\nwould never have been able to have satisfactorily explained the peculiar\r\nphenomenon produced by the great Michigan fire.\r\n\r\nIf the delicate redness of the sky is not caused by dust, what is it\r\ncaused by?\r\n\r\nBut for the weather map, I think we should still be in the dark in\r\nregard to it.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, this redness is nothing new, only the conditions\r\nare more favorable sometimes than at others. It has always existed and\r\nalways will exist, independent of earthquakes, volcanoes, etc. Nature\r\nis ever changing; the movements of the atmosphere more resemble the\r\nkaleidoscope than any thing else.\r\n\r\nThe summer and fall of 1883, the movements of \"high\" (high barometer)\r\nover the United States were quite central and extensive, causing this\r\npeculiar phenomenon over a wide extent of territory.\r\n\r\nWe have no information of the condition of the barometer over the other\r\npart of the world; we speak move particularly of the United States; yet\r\nif certain conditions produce certain effects here, it is quite safe to\r\nsay that the same effects are produced by the same cause elsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs now well established by the map, the surface wind is from the area\r\nof high barometer to that of low--from the atmospheric hill to the\r\natmospheric valley.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of this is to free \"high\" of all clouds and moisture; but\r\nthen it is impossible to free \"high\" entirely of moisture; a little\r\nwill remain, and it is just this little, which is highly rarefied, that\r\nproduces the result. We look around us and above, we see little or no\r\nevidence of evaporation, yet it is the while going on. When the sun is\r\nimmediately below the horizon, where it will shine horizontally through\r\nthe mass of light, suspended moisture, the delicate presence of vapor\r\nheretofore unnoticed is revealed. The action of the sun's rays is the\r\nsame as when illuminating a well formed cloud--it is an embodiment\r\nof the same principle, but the material is much more expanded. The\r\nparticles of suspended moisture are very fine, few and far between,\r\ntherefore the effect of the light upon it is more diffused and\r\ntransparent. It is much like looking through a piece of window glass\r\nflatwise and endwise; flatwise we do not perceive any color; endwise,\r\nfrom seeing through a greater mass, the glass has a very perceptible\r\ngreen color.\r\n\r\nWe see the same idea also in the rising and setting sun and moon. On\r\na clear, cloudless night, when nothing seems to interfere with the\r\nbrightness of the stars, we cannot, by looking upward, perceive any\r\nmoisture present in the atmosphere; but if we cast our eyes to the\r\nhorizon, whereby we see through the mass of atmosphere endwise, as it\r\nwere, and note the appearance of the stars there, or the rising or\r\nsetting moon, we will see that the atmosphere there gives a redness\r\nto the rising body, which it does not have when it has ascended to\r\nmid-heaven. On a clear night, which is caused by the presence of the\r\narea of high barometer, the moon when in mid-heaven is of a clear,\r\nsilver-white, and it is the same moon that at the horizon was a deep\r\nred. The color of the moon has not changed; it is simply the medium\r\nthrough which it is seen that produces the difference in color.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, on a clear, bright (\"high\") night, when the moon is full,\r\nprior to rising, when just below the horizon, it will so illuminate this\r\nlower strata of atmosphere as to appear like a great fire; the moon\r\nrises red, but its deep color gradually fades as it rises, and when well\r\nup in the heavens we perceive that this deep coloring was an illusion\r\nand merely the influence of its surroundings. I never, though, knew of\r\nany one to attempt to account for this by \"meteoric dust;\" and yet it is\r\nan embodiment of the same principle. Place the sun where the moon is,\r\nand from its far superior abundance of light we have a much grander\r\ndisplay.\r\n\r\nUnder no other conditions or relations of the sun and earth is it\r\npossible to have this phenomenon of the delicate red sky but when a\r\npositive area of high barometer is passing and extends over us. In\r\norder to produce this effect we must have the clear atmosphere of high\r\nbarometer, when there is a minimum of moisture present. The action of\r\nthe sun's rays upon this extensive area of slightly moist rarefied\r\nair is unconfined by clouds, and reaches far and wide, and produces\r\na delicacy of color which from no other source or condition can be\r\nrealized.\r\n\r\nISAAC P.

It was not, however, until January of\r\nthe present year that I sent a brief communication to the _Brooklyn\r\nEagle_, which was published Feb. 3, giving my views in relation to\r\ncometary phenomena. With this I might remain satisfied, were it not\r\nthat the interesting paper by G. D. Hiscox, published in the SCIENTIFIC\r\nAMERICAN SUPPLEMENT, Feb. 16, impressed me with the idea that the theory\r\nI advanced might assist in explaining others, if brought to the notice\r\nof those interested through the columns of your valuable journal.\r\n\r\nThe theory that I advance to account for the several phenomena relating\r\nto comets' tails is, that comets are non-luminous, transparent bodies;\r\nthat they transmit the light of the sun; that the transmitted light\r\nreflected by the particles of matter in space constitutes the tails of\r\ncomets. \"Like causes produce like effects.\" By contraries, then, like\r\neffects must be produced by similar causes; for, if an effect produced\r\nby a cause which is known is similar to an effect produced by a cause\r\nwhich is not known, the cause which is known must be similar to the\r\ncause which is not known. This is true or not.\r\n\r\nI submit the following experiments to substantiate the theory advanced.\r\n\r\nPartially fill a vial or a tumbler with water, hold it by the rim,\r\nand move it around a lighted candle placed upon a table. A shadow\r\nsurrounding the transmitted light will be cast upon the table. As the\r\ntumbler approaches the light, the shadow follows the tumbler, and when\r\nreceding the tumbler follows the shadow; and as the tumbler is moved\r\naround the light, the shadow will swing round from one side to the\r\nother. If the tumbler be held so that a puff of smoke can be blown\r\ninto the transmitted rays, the particles of smoke will reflect the\r\ntransmitted light, and will illustrate my idea of what constitutes a\r\ncomet's tail. A dark band may be observed in this stream of light, as\r\nalso in the light cast upon the table.\r\n\r\nIn these experiments, we see the effects produced by a cause which is\r\nknown; the effects are similar to those observed in the tails of comets,\r\nthe cause of which we do not know; but is it not reasonable to assume\r\nthat the cause is similar?\r\n\r\nAssuming now that comets are transparent, can any other phenomena\r\npeculiar to comets be accounted for upon this hypothesis? Next to\r\nthe tail itself, the curve is the most noticeable feature, and if we\r\nconsider the extraordinary length of these appendages, the astounding\r\nvelocity at which comets move in their orbits, and the time that would\r\nelapse before a ray of light, emitted from the nucleus, would reach the\r\nend of the tail, perhaps the curve--which, if I am not deceived in my\r\nobservations, always dips toward its orbit--can be accounted for. If a\r\ncomet moved in a direct line toward the center of the sun, there would\r\nbe no curve to the tail. But taking Donati's comet of 1858 as an\r\nexample, the tail of which was said to be about 200,000,000 miles long,\r\na ray of light traveling at the rate of 192,000 miles per second would\r\nbe about twenty minutes in going from the nucleus to the end of the\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nBut during that time the comet would move in its orbit, say, 50,000\r\nmiles, and as light moves in a straight line, and other rays are\r\nconstantly emerging from the nucleus as it moves along in its course,\r\nthe result is that the tail has a curved appearance.\r\n\r\nI have no data at hand regarding this comet, but what I have said will\r\nserve to illustrate my ideas. Again, referring to this comet, I remember\r\nto have read the statement of an astronomer that, after passing round\r\nthe sun, a new tail was formed opposite the original one. Now, it seems\r\nto me that that is just what would happen, for in moving round the sun\r\nthe comet would travel say 3,000,000 miles; the greater portion of the\r\ntail then, would extend millions of miles upon one side of the sun,\r\nwhile from the nucleus upon the opposite side of the sun a new tail\r\nwould appear to be formed.\r\n\r\nUpon this hypothesis, the extraordinary length of their tails and the\r\nfact that stars are visible through the densest portion of them is\r\nexplained; as also the fact that they so rapidly disappear from view\r\nwhen moving from the sun, the light received by them from the sun\r\nbeing in proportion to their distance from it, and but little of that\r\nreflected.\r\n\r\nJOHN M. HUGHES.\r\n\r\nBrooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[FOR THE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON COMETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we see a comet approaching the sun with its tail following in the\r\norbit of the nucleus, we have no great difficulty in believing the\r\ncommon theory that a comet consists of nucleus attracted toward the sun,\r\nwhile the tail is repelled; and that we see the whole of it. But as it\r\napproaches the sun, difficulties arise that make us doubt whether the\r\ntheory be true.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose a comet with a tail 50,000,000 miles in length, and that\r\nit will require two days to pass round the sun. Now the tail, being\r\nalways in a line drawn through the center of the sun and center of the\r\nnucleus, will, when it reaches the long axis of the elliptical orbit,\r\nstand perpendicularly to the orbit of the nucleus. That is, the\r\nextremity of the tail farthest from the sun, in addition to its onward\r\nmotion, has acquired a lateral motion that has lifted it 50,000,000\r\nmiles in the first day of its perihelion. The velocity of the extremity\r\nhas been vastly accelerated over that of the nucleus, and it has\r\nmoreover a sheer lift above the orbit of the nucleus. Now this lift is\r\nin opposition to gravity; neither is it in consequence of any previous\r\nmomentum, for its velocity is accelerated and its previous momentum\r\nwould be a hindrance; nor is the lift in consequence of any repelling\r\nforce from the sun, for such force would be diminished in proportion to\r\nthe square of the distance, and the far end would be acted on less than\r\nthe nucleus end of the tail, whereas the velocity of the former is\r\nincreased a hundred fold over that of the latter. A polar force in the\r\ncomet would merely draw the comet into the sun. We therefore find no\r\nforce adequate for such a lift, but on the contrary all the forces are\r\nopposed to it.\r\n\r\nBut if the first day of the perihelion overwhelms us with difficulty,\r\nthe second day will prove disastrous to the common theory. For the\r\nextremity of the tail farthest from the sun will be required to pass\r\nwith lateral motion from its perpendicular 100,000,000 miles, so that it\r\nmay be in advance of the nucleus and again rest on its orbit. This orbit\r\nis an impassable line, and therefore instantly arrests the prodigious\r\nlateral velocity of the tail. That impassable orbital line is to it\r\nas solid and inflexible as a wall of adamant. The motion so instantly\r\narrested would be disastrous to any tail, whether composed of gas,\r\nmeteorites, or electricity, whatever that may be.\r\n\r\nHaving shown that the common theory of comets is filled with insuperable\r\ndifficulties, I will again call attention to a theory proposed about\r\neighteen months ago in the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN.\r\n\r\nAccording to this theory, a comet consists of a nucleus and an\r\natmosphere, for the most part invisible, surrounding it on all sides to\r\nan extent at least equal to the length of the tail. The rays of the sun\r\nin passing through or near the nucleus are so modified as to become\r\nvisible in their further progress through the cometic atmosphere, while\r\nall the rest remain invisible. What we call the tail is merely a radius\r\nof the cometic atmosphere made visible, and as the comet moves through\r\nspace, only different portions of the atmosphere come in sight, in\r\nobedience to the ordinary laws of light. There is no difficulty in\r\naccounting for the rise and fall of the tail at perihelion, nor for the\r\ntail preceding the nucleus afterward.\r\n\r\nThe spherical theory accounts easily for the different forms of tail\r\nseen in different comets. The sword shaped tails, at variance with the\r\ncommon theory, can be accounted for by supposing a slight difference in\r\ndensity or material in the cometic atmosphere, which will deflect the\r\nlight as seen. The comet of 1823, which cannot be explained on the\r\ncommon theory, is very easily explained on the spherical. That comet\r\nshowed two tails, apparently of equal length, which moved opposite to\r\neach other, and perpendicularly to the orbit of the nucleus, and showing\r\nno signs of repulsive force from the sun. On the spherical theory it is\r\nonly necessary to suppose such an arrangement of the nucleus as would\r\nreflect the rays of the sun laterally; a slight modification of the\r\nnucleus would give not only two but any number of tails pointing in\r\ndifferent directions.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected to the spherical theory that a tail 50,000,000 miles\r\nlong would call for a sphere 100,000,000 miles in diameter, and that\r\nwould be too vast for our solar system. But it is claimed for this\r\nsphere that it consists of the same material as the so-called tail, and\r\nthat it has the same capability of moving among planets without manifest\r\ndisturbance to either.\r\n\r\nThe sphere at the perihelion would envelop the sun, and as a noticeable\r\nreduction is sometimes found in its so-called tail, the cometic\r\natmosphere may impart to the sun at that time whatever is necessary to\r\nits use.\r\n\r\nThat there is something in common between the sun's corona and cometary\r\nmatter was shown by the last solar eclipse observed in South Pacific\r\nOcean, where the spectrum of sun's corona was found to be the same as\r\nthat of a comet's tail. Are we to attribute in any degree the different\r\nappearances of the sun's corona to the presence or absence of a comet\r\nat its perihelion? At the eclipse of the sun seen in Upper Egypt two or\r\nthree years ago, a comet was seen close to the sun, but I have seen no\r\naccount of the appearance of the corona at that time.\r\n\r\nFURMAN LEAMING, M.D.\r\n\r\nRomney, Tippecanoe Co.

A good long\r\nstretch of wall covered with a selection of the best green-leaved kind\r\nis always interesting, and never more so than during the winter months,\r\nespecially if at intervals the golden Japanese jasmine is planted among\r\nthem or a few plants of pyracantha or of Simmon's cotoneaster for the\r\nsake of their coral fruitage. The large-leaved golden ivy is also very\r\neffective here and there along a sunny wall, especially if contrasted\r\nwith the small-leaved kind--atropurpurea--which has dark purple or\r\nbronzy foliage at this season. Of the large-leaved kinds, one of the\r\nmost distinct is canariensis, or large-leaved Irish ivy, and Raegner's\r\nvariety, with leathery, heart-shaped foliage, is also handsome. The\r\nbirdsfoot ivy (pedata) is curious, as it clings to the stones like\r\ndelicate leaf embroidery, and for shining green leafage but few equal\r\nto the one called lucida. The two other kinds sketched are hastata and\r\ndigitata, both free growing and distinct sorts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VARIOUS FORMS OF IVY. Heart-leaved Ivy (Hedera\r\nRaegenerana). Glossy Ivy (H. lucida).

Of all the different forms of ivy, I think\r\nthe large-leaved golden one of the best; certainly the best of the\r\nvariegated kinds. Raegner's variety is also very bold, its great glossy,\r\nheart-shaped leaves most effective. Algeriensis is another fine-leaved\r\nkind, the form dentata producing foliage even still larger when well\r\ngrown. For making low evergreen edgings on the turf, for carpeting\r\nbanks, the covering of bare walls and the old tree stumps, we have no\r\nother evergreen shrub so fresh and variable, or so easily cultivated as\r\nare these forms of the ivy green. Perhaps one reason why the finer kinds\r\nof ivy are comparatively uncommon is the fact that a strong prejudice\r\nexists against ivy in many minds. It is an erroneous notion that ivy\r\ninjures buildings against the walls of which it is planted; it never\r\ninjures a good wall, nor a sound house, but on the contrary, hides and\r\nsoftens the stony bareness of the one and adds beauty and freshness to\r\nthe other.--_The Garden_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VARIOUS FORMS OF IVY.

After stating that out of a case\r\ncontaining 310 cuttings only five failed to root, the article proceeds:\r\nThe case or box is made of common rough deal boards. It is five feet\r\nsix inches long and one foot in depth. Within half an inch of the top a\r\ngroove is cut inside the box, into which the glass is slid, after the\r\nmanner of a sliding box lid. In the end of the third week in July the\r\nbox was placed in the kitchen garden under the shadow of a high north\r\nwall; it was then about half filled with good turfy loam, to which had\r\nbeen added a little leaf mould and a good sprinkling of sharp sand. The\r\nsoil was then pressed down very firmly (the box being nearly half full\r\nwhen pressed), and then thoroughly well soaked with rain water, and\r\nallowed to stay uncovered until the next day. The next day good stout\r\ncuttings were taken of all the roses, both tea and hybrid perpetual,\r\nwhich it was desired to add to the stock. They were then inserted\r\nclosely and firmly in the soil, just over the bottom leaf, the glasses\r\nwere slipped on and puttied down; the grooves in which the glass slid,\r\nand even the joints in the glass, being filled with putty, so as to\r\nexclude the air. The whole thing completed, nothing more remained to be\r\ndone but to leave the box in its cool, shady nook for five or six weeks,\r\nwhen the growing points of the free starting kinds gave notice that the\r\nglasses might be removed, a bit at a time, with safety. Nothing could be\r\nmore simple, or demand less skill, and the operation may be carried out\r\nsuccessfully by an amateur at any time during the season, when good firm\r\ncuttings can be got, and when six weeks' tolerably fine weather may be\r\ncounted on. The success of the whole thing depends on having the glasses\r\nfixed so that they may not be removed until the cuttings are rooted, and\r\nin placing the boxes in a shady place. So treated, carnations and many\r\nof our shrubs and herbaceous perennials may be propagated by unskilled\r\npersons with certainty, and without much trouble.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW OF THE BEST INULAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the fifty-six species of Inula described in scientific works,\r\nprobably not more than thirty are at present in cultivation in\r\nthis country, and those are chiefly confined to botanic gardens,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that many of them are useful garden plants.\r\nThey are principally distributed throughout Southern Europe, although we\r\nfind them extending to Siberia and the Himalayas; indeed, it is to the\r\nHimalayas we are indebted for the kinds that are most ornamental. Some\r\nof the low-growing species are extremely useful for the rockery, such\r\nas I. montana (the Mountain Inula), a fine dwarf plant with woolly\r\nlanceolate leaves and dense heads of orange-colored flowers, resembling\r\nin habit and general appearance some of the creeping Hieraciums. It is a\r\nhandsome and desirable plant for the decoration of old walls and similar\r\nplaces, where it can be a little sheltered from rain and drip. Another\r\nvery useful species for this purpose is I. rhizocephaloides, found\r\nplentifully in the Himalayas. It is one of the prettiest Alpine\r\ncomposites we have. It seldom attains more than from one inch to two\r\ninches in height, forming a dense rosette of short, hairy, oval leaves,\r\nin the center of which the bright purple involucres, in the form of a\r\nball, are extremely interesting. It is easily cultivated, requiring,\r\nhowever, a rather snug nook, where it will not be allowed to become too\r\ndry. It is best propagated from seed. Then there is the woolly Inula (I.\r\ncandida), a pretty plant with small oval leaves, covered with a thick,\r\nsilky down, and much in the way of the white-leaved I. limonifolia, both\r\nof which are very effective when grown in masses, which should always\r\nbe low down near the front of a rockery, or as an edging for a mixed\r\nborder. The glandular-leaved Inula (I. glandulosa), of which a good\r\nrepresentation is here given, is a beautiful hardy perennial. It is a\r\nnative of Georgia and the Caucasian Alps, near the Caspian Sea. It is\r\na rather robust-growing species, with large, bright, orange-yellow\r\nflowers, varying from three to five inches in diameter, the narrow and\r\nvery straggly ray florets contrasting nicely with the rather prominent\r\ndisk. The leaves, although quite entire, seem notched, owing to large\r\nblack glands which form on their margins. They are lanceolate, and clasp\r\nthe stem. The plant is very variable, both as regards robustness and\r\nsize of flowers, and this may in a measure account for the confusion\r\nexisting between it and I. Oculus-Christi.\r\n\r\nThe soil most suitable for the full development of I. glandulosa is a\r\nstrong, clayey, retentive loam; it does not thrive well in the light\r\nshallow soils in the neighborhood of London, except in shady positions.\r\nI. Hookeri is a free-flowering perennial, with pointed lanceolate\r\nleaves, of a delicate texture, bright green, and very finely toothed.\r\nThe flowers, which are sweet-scented, are not so large as those of I.\r\nglandulosa, and are produced singly, the ray florets being, however,\r\nmuch more numerous, rarely numbering less than thirty. It is found in\r\nabundance in rocky places in Sikkim, where it replaces the nearly allied\r\nI. grandiflora, a dwarfer species, with much shorter, shining leaves;\r\nboth are very desirable plants either for rockery or flower border work.\r\nThe Elecampane (I. Helenium) is an imposing, robust-growing species,\r\nhaving large, broad leaves a foot or more in length. It grows from four\r\nfeet to five feet in height, and its thick, shaggy branches are crowned\r\nwith large yellow flowers. For isolating in woods this plant, is very\r\nuseful, and with the exception of Telekia cordifolia, it would be hard\r\nto find a rival to it. It is, I believe, pretty extensively used for\r\nplanting in shrubberies, but unless they are thin and open it is seldom\r\nseen to advantage. It is found wild or naturalized in some parts of\r\nEngland. It flowers in June and July, and even into August when the\r\nseason has been favorable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INULA GLANDULOSA (_flowers deep yellow_.)]\r\n\r\nFor naturalizing in woods the following will be found useful, _viz_., I.\r\nsalicina, I. Oculus-Christi, I. squarrosa, I. britannica, and many more,\r\nthe true beauty of which can only be realized in this way. With the\r\nexception of I. rhizocepbaloides, they are all propagated by division\r\nwith the greatest ease, or by seed, which is best sown as soon as it is\r\nripe.--_D.K., The Garden_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUIT GROWING.\r\n\r\nBy P.H. FOSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the first place, if you contemplate appropriating a portion of your\r\nland for the raising of fruits, you should have the orchard so situated\r\nthat no large animals can run at large on the grounds. Prepare your soil\r\nin the most thorough manner; underdrain, if necessary, to carry off\r\nsurplus water; dig deep, large holes; fill in the bottom with debris;\r\nin the very bottom put a few leaves, clam and oyster shells, etc., then\r\nsods; above and below the roots put a good garden or field soil; do not\r\ngive the trees fresh manure at the time of setting, but the following\r\nfall manure highly with any kind on top of the ground; dig it in the\r\nfollowing spring; keep the soil frequently worked during the summer,\r\nand, if convenient, mulch with hay, straw, or leaves.\r\n\r\nNow you are on the road to progress, provided you have made no mistake\r\nin the selection of your trees. The purposes for which you intend your\r\nfruit is highly important. You should well consider at the outset if\r\nfor family or market use. This is a business which requires a long look\r\nahead, for it is said, \"He who plants pears looks ahead for his heirs.\"\r\n\r\nCaution should be used in procuring your stock; little should be planted\r\nthat is not fairly tested on the Island, purchased of parties who can be\r\nfully relied upon to give you what you want. Do not buy your stock of\r\nparties who carry labels in their pockets to make to order what you want\r\nout of the same bundle of trees.\r\n\r\nNow, having your trees set out in a proper manner, of such varieties\r\nas you desire, the next important step is to bring the trees into\r\nusefulness. My plan is to use bone--fine bone--very freely about every\r\nthree years. Another important matter is that of trimming. \"Fire\r\npurifies,\" and the knife regulates the grand balance or equilibrium\r\nbetween roots and tops. In most cases the top outgrows the roots, the\r\nconsequence of which is an ultimate weakness of the tree. It is thrown\r\ninto excessive fruiting, disease, and premature decay. To avoid this\r\nresult, use the knife when required. Thin out the inside branches when\r\nsmall, and if the tree does not make a satisfactory growth, cut back\r\nhalf way to the ground.\r\n\r\nWe will suppose that you have got your trees growing nicely, and they\r\nhave begun to bear fruit. There are other important steps to be taken,\r\nwhich will be of little cost to you. Provide a wind-break for the\r\norchard. Evergreens answer the purpose, being a protection against the\r\nwind. Having this matter attended to, there are other enemies with which\r\nwe must contend. I refer to the apple and peach tree borers. The former\r\nwill live in the tree for three years, if unmolested; the latter, one\r\nyear only. They are very easily destroyed by looking over the trees and\r\ntaking them out with a knife; or maybe prevented from touching the trees\r\nby wrapping a piece of felt paper, 8 inches wide, around the tree near\r\nthe ground, the bottom being covered with dirt and the top tied tightly\r\nabove. The pear is not generally disturbed by these insects--only the\r\napple, peach, and quince. We have another insect very destructive to the\r\nplum, peach, cherry, and apple--the _curcutio_, or plum weavel. This\r\nseason for the first time in twenty years we have gathered a small\r\ncrop of that very desirable plum, the Purple Favorite. We simply threw\r\nair-slaked lime over the trees nearly every morning for from four to six\r\nweeks, from the time the tree was out of bloom. Peach trees should be\r\ntreated in the same manner. Another method of fighting this insect is to\r\nspread a sheet under the tree, and with a blow jar off the little Turk\r\nand secure him on the sheet. But I consider the lime procedure the less\r\ntrouble and more effective. The tent caterpillar, which is easily seen,\r\nshould be destroyed at once. We have yet another insect to contend with\r\nwhich infests the apple and pear, commonly called the Coddling Moth,\r\nand the larva, the apple-worm (_Garpocapsa pomonella_). The loss by the\r\nravaaes of this insect alone to the fruit growers of the United States\r\nfan hardly be estimated, as in many cases the whole crop is rendered\r\nworthless. Such a vast destruction of two of the most valuable fruits\r\nthe world produces should stimulate scientists in this age of progress\r\nto discover an effectual remedy against such a gigantic evil.\r\n\r\nI have never yet discovered nor tried an effectual remedy against this\r\ninsect. The nearest I have approached his extermination is in the\r\nfollowing manner: After it has entered the fruit and accomplished its\r\ndamage, the time arrives when it has to leave the fruit and hide itself\r\nin a quiet, secure position to undergo the transition from the larva to\r\nthe pupa state, which requires, in the early part of the season, eight\r\nor ten days; after this time the miller is hatched and is again ready to\r\nbesiege the fruit with its sting. The insect, being two-brooded in this\r\nclimate at least, if not disturbed, has an aggregating force to do\r\nmischief the second time. The progeny for the succeeding year have alone\r\nto depend on the security of this second generation of larvæ. As they\r\nmay often be found in bark of apple trees during winter, my plan of\r\ndestruction is, about the first of July to take woolen rags long enough\r\nto wrap around the trees, and say four inches wide. Each week I look\r\nover the trees, and destroy the worms secreted under the rags and\r\nwherever I find them until the fruit is off the trees. I have all the\r\ngreen fruit, of every kind, carefully picked up as soon as it falls,\r\nthereby destroying many of the curculio as well as the apple-worms.\r\n\r\nOne word upon the grape--the insect part of the question. The\r\n_Phylloxera vastatrix_, or grape-vine louse, is already at work on Long\r\nIsland. It is found very difficult to raise many of our fine, new grapes\r\nwith us in consequence of the depredations of this very minute insect,\r\nit being almost too small to be seen by the naked eye. There has lately\r\nbeen discovered a remedy which is entirely chemical and as yet but\r\nlittle disseminated. Very soon, no doubt, a discovery will be made that\r\nwill stay the progress of this destructive enemy.\r\n\r\nWe should plant aplenty of cherry and small fruit trees to yield feed\r\nfor birds. In return they will assist us in our efforts to preserve a\r\nbountiful supply of this health producing element.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOARSE FOOD FOR PIGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA recent subscriber wants advice how to feed pigs of 25 to 35 pounds\r\nweight, that are to be kept over winter and fitted for sale at about six\r\nmonths old--whether coarse food will not help them as much in winter as\r\nin summer. How roots and pumpkins will answer in lieu of grass, and what\r\ncan be fed when this green food is gone? He has had poor success in\r\ngrowing young pigs on corn alone. He has a reasonably warm pen for\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nThe question of food is constantly recurring, and this is one of the\r\nbest evidences of the advancement of the country in the feeder's\r\nart. When people are making no inquiry as to improved methods in any\r\ndirection, no progress can be made. There has been more progress made\r\nin the philosophy of feeding during the last thirty years than in the\r\ncentury and a half previous.\r\n\r\nIn pig feeding in the dairy districts, young pigs generally grow up in\r\na very healthy condition, owing to the refuse milk of the dairy, which\r\nfurnishes the principal food of young pigs. Skim-milk contains all the\r\nelements for growing the muscles and bones of young pigs. This gave them\r\na good, rangy frame, and, when desired, could be fed into 400 or 500\r\npounds weight. But the fault attending this feeding was, that it was too\r\nscanty to produce such rapid growth as is desired. It took too long to\r\ndevelop them for the best profit. It had not then been discovered by the\r\nfarmer that it costs less to put the first hundred pounds on the pig\r\nthan the second, and less for the second than the third, etc.; that it\r\nwas much cheaper to produce 200 pounds of pork in six months than in\r\nnine and twelve months. When it became evident that profit required more\r\nrapid feeding, then they began to ply them continually with the most\r\nconcentrated food--corn meal or clear corn. If this was fed in summer,\r\non pasture, no harm was observed, for the grass gave bulk in the\r\nstomach, and the pigs were were healthy and made good progress. But if\r\nthe young pigs were fed in pen in winter upon corn meal or clear corn,\r\nthe result was quite different; this concentrated food produced feverish\r\nsymptoms, and the pigs would lose their appetite for a few days,\r\ndrinking only water, which, after a while, would relieve the stomach,\r\nand the pigs would eat vigorously again. Now, had they been fed a few\r\nquarts of turnips, carrots, beets, or pumpkins, to give bulk to the\r\nstomach, and separate the concentrated food, no harm would have come.\r\nThis gives the gastric juice a free circulation through the contents of\r\nthe stomach, the food is properly digested and applied to the needs of\r\nthe body instead of causing fever by remaining in the stomach.--_Live\r\nStock Journal_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMETE KINGI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur engraving is a portrait of a familiar character in New Zealand,\r\nchief Mete Kingi, who recently died at the age of one hundred years.\r\nHe was a fine specimen of the Maori race, the native New Zealanders, a\r\nbranch of the Malayo-Polynesian family. The New Zealanders surpassed\r\nall other people in the art of tattooing, to which their chiefs gave\r\nespecial attention. Mete Kingi, as our picture shows, was no exception.\r\nTattooing on the face they termed _moko_. The men tattoo their faces,\r\nhips, and thighs; the women their upper lips; for this purpose charcoal\r\nmade from kauri gum is chiefly used. It has the blue color when pricked\r\ninto the skin, growing lighter in shade in the course of years. The\r\nsubject of our illustration embraced Christianity, and was much\r\nrespected. Our engraving is from the _Illustrated Australian News_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LATE MAORI CHIEF METE KINGI.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAKE TAHOE.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome very interesting information by Prof. John Le Conte, is given in\r\nthe _Overland Monthly_, being the result of some physical observations\r\nmade by the author at Lake Tahoe, in 1873. Lake Tahoe, also called Lake\r\nBigler, is situated at an altitude of 6,247 feet in the Sierra Nevada\r\nMountains, partly in California, partly in Nevada. The lake has a length\r\nof 22 and a width of 12 miles. As regards its origin, the author regards\r\nit as a \"plication hollow,\" or a trough produced by the formation of two\r\nmountain ridges, afterward modified by glacial agency. The depth of the\r\nlake is remarkable; the observations taken at ten stations along the\r\nlength of the lake gave the following depths in feet: 900, 1,385, 1,495,\r\n1,500, 1,506, 1,540, 1,504, 1,600, 1,640, 1645. This depth exceeds that\r\nof the Swiss lakes proper--Lake Geneva, for example, has a maximum depth\r\nof 1,096 feet--but is considerably less than that of Lakes Maggiore and\r\nComo, on the Italian side of the Alps. A series of observations of the\r\ntemperature of the water were taken between the 11th and 18th of August.\r\nThe average corrected results are as follows:\r\n\r\n   Depth in feet.                               Temp. (C.)\r\n     0(surface).................................19.4\r\n    50..........................................17.2\r\n   100..........................................12.8\r\n   150..........................................10.0\r\n   200.......................................... 8.9\r\n   250.......................................... 8.3\r\n   300.......................................... 7.8\r\n   330 (bottom)................................. 7.5\r\n   400.......................................... 7.2\r\n   480 (bottom)................................. 6.9\r\n   500.......................................... 6.7\r\n   600.......................................... 6.1\r\n   772 (bottom)................................. 5.0\r\n  1506 (bottom)..............,.................. 4.0\r\n\r\nThe temperature, therefore, diminishes with increasing depth to about\r\n700 or 800 feet, and below this remains sensibly the same down to 1,506\r\nfeet; or in other words, a constant temperature of 4° C. prevails at all\r\ndepths below about. 820 feet. This is in accordance with the theory, the\r\ntemperature named being that of the maximum density of water, and it\r\nconfirms the recent observations of Prof. Forel in Switzerland; he\r\nfound, for example, that a constant temperature of 4° C. was reached in\r\nLake Zurich at a depth of nearly 400 feet, the lake being then covered\r\nwith 4 inches of ice. The explanation of the observed fact that Lake\r\nTahoe does not entirely freeze over even in severe winters is found in\r\nthe extreme depth; and the fact that the bodies of drowned persons do\r\nnot rise to the surface after the lapse of the usual time is explained\r\nby the low temperature prevailing near the bottom, which does not allow\r\nthe necessary decomposition to go forward so as to produce the ordinary\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nThe water of Lake Tahoe is remarkable both for its transparency and\r\nbeauty of color. A series of observations made at the close of August or\r\nbeginning of September showed that a horizontally adjusted dinner plate\r\nof about 9½ inches diameter was visible at noon at a depth of 108 feet.\r\nThe maximum depth of the limit of visibility as found by Prof. Forel, in\r\nLake Geneva, was 56 feet. He showed, moreover, that this limit is much\r\ngreater in. winter than in summer, as explained in part by the greater\r\nabsence of suspended matter and in part by the fact that increase of\r\ntemperature increases the absorbing power of water for light. The\r\nmaximum depth of visibility in the Atlantic Ocean, as found by Count\r\nde Pourtales, was 162 feet, and Prof. Le Conte states his belief that\r\nwinter observations in Lake Tahoe would place the limit at even a\r\ngreater depth than this. The author gives a detailed and interesting\r\ndiscussion in regard to the blue color of lake waters, reviewing in full\r\nthe results of previous writers on the subject, and concludes that while\r\npure water unquestionably absorbs a larger part of the red end of the\r\nspectrum, and hence appears blue by transmitted light, the color seen by\r\ndiffuse reflection is mainly due to the selective reflection from the\r\nfine particles suspended in it.\r\n\r\nThe last subject discussed by the author is that of the rhythmical\r\nvariations of level, or \"seiches,\" of deep lakes; he applies the usual\r\nformula to Lake Tahoe, and calculates from it the length of a complete\r\nlongitudinal and of a transverse \"seiche;\" these are found to be\r\neighteen or nineteen minutes in the first case and thirteen minutes in\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA catalogue, containing brief notices of many important scientific\r\npapers heretofore published in the SUPPLEMENT, may be had gratis at this\r\noffice.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN SUPPLEMENT.\r\n\r\nPUBLISHED WEEKLY.\r\n\r\nTERMS OF SUBSCRIPTION, $5 A YEAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nSent by mail, postage prepaid, to subscribers in any part of the United\r\nStates or Canada.
