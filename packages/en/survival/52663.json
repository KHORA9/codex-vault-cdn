This is\r\nplainly impossible, unless every article should be very short and\r\nimperfect. All that the Public are entitled to expect is, that in\r\nthe progress of the Journal, the various subjects mentioned may\r\noccupy such an extent as our communications and resources shall\r\npermit.\r\n\r\nWe have been honoured by such a list of names of gentlemen who are\r\nwilling to be considered as contributors to this Journal, that the\r\npublication of it would afford us no ordinary gratification, did we\r\nnot feel that it is more decorous to allow their names to appear\r\nwith their communications, without laying them under a previous\r\npledge to the Public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN OF THE WORK.\r\n\r\nThis Journal is intended to embrace the circle of THE PHYSICAL\r\nSCIENCES, with their application to THE ARTS, and to every useful\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIt is designed as a deposit for _original American communications_;\r\nit will contain also occasional selections from Foreign Journals,\r\nand notices of the progress of Science in other countries. Within\r\nits plan are embraced\r\n\r\nNATURAL HISTORY, in its three great departments of MINERALOGY,\r\nBOTANY, and ZOOLOGY.\r\n\r\nCHEMISTRY and NATURAL PHILOSOPHY, and their various branches: and\r\nMATHEMATICS, pure and mixed.\r\n\r\nIt will be a leading object to illustrate AMERICAN NATURAL HISTORY,\r\nand especially our MINERALOGY and GEOLOGY.\r\n\r\nThe APPLICATIONS of these sciences are obviously as numerous as\r\n_physical arts_, and _physical wants_; for no one of these arts or\r\nwants can be named which is not connected with them.\r\n\r\nWhile SCIENCE will be cherished _for its own sake_, and with\r\na due respect for its own _inherent_ dignity; it will also be\r\nemployed as the _hand-maid to the Arts_. Its numerous applications\r\nto AGRICULTURE, the earliest and most important of them: to\r\nMANUFACTURES, both mechanical and chemical; and, to DOMESTIC\r\nECONOMY, will be carefully sought out, and faithfully made.\r\n\r\nIt is within the design of this Journal to receive communications\r\nlikewise on MUSIC, SCULPTURE, ENGRAVING, PAINTING, and generally on\r\nthe fine and liberal, as well as useful arts;\r\n\r\nOn Military and Civil Engineering, and the art of Navigation;\r\n\r\nNotices, Reviews, and Analyses of new scientific works; accounts of\r\nInventions, and Specifications of Patents;\r\n\r\nBiographical and Obituary Notices of scientific men; essays on\r\nCOMPARATIVE ANATOMY and PHYSIOLOGY, and generally on such other\r\nbranches of medicine as depend on scientific principles;\r\n\r\nMeteorological Registers, and Reports of Agricultural Experiments:\r\nand interesting Miscellaneous Articles, not perhaps exactly\r\nincluded under either of the above heads.\r\n\r\nCommunications are respectfully solicited from men of science, and\r\n_from men versed in the practical arts_.\r\n\r\nLearned Societies are invited to make this Journal, occasionally,\r\nthe vehicle of their communications to the Public.\r\n\r\nThe Editor will not hold himself responsible for the sentiments and\r\nopinions advanced by his correspondents: he will consider it as an\r\nallowed liberty to make slight _verbal alterations_, where errors\r\nmay be presumed to have arisen from inadvertency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                                                              Page\r\n\r\n  INTRODUCTORY Remarks                                           1\r\n\r\n  Art.

The utility of such Journals has thus become\r\ngenerally evident; they are the heralds of science; they proclaim\r\nits toils and its achievements; they demonstrate its intimate\r\nconnexion as well with the comfort, as with the intellectual and\r\nmoral improvement of our species; and they often procure for it\r\nenviable honours and substantial rewards.\r\n\r\nIn England the interests of science have been, for a series of\r\nyears, greatly promoted by the excellent Journals of Tilloch and\r\nNicholson; and for the loss of the latter, the scientific world has\r\nbeen fully compensated by Dr. Thomson's Annals of Philosophy, and\r\nby the Journal of Science and the Arts, both published in London.\r\n\r\nIn France, the Annales de Chimie et de Physique, the Journal des\r\nMines, the Journal de Physique, &c. have long enjoyed a high and\r\ndeserved reputation. Indeed, there are few countries in Europe\r\nwhich do not produce some similar publication; not to mention the\r\ntransactions of learned societies and numerous medical Journals.\r\n\r\nFrom these sources _our_ country reaps, and will long continue\r\nto reap, an abundant harvest of information: and if the light of\r\nscience, as well as of day, springs from the east, we will welcome\r\nthe rays of both; nor should national pride induce us to reject so\r\nrich an offering.\r\n\r\nBut can we do nothing in return? In a general diffusion of\r\nuseful information through the various classes of society, in\r\nactivity of intellect, and fertility of resource and invention,\r\ncharacterizing a highly intelligent population, we have no reason\r\nto shrink from a comparison with any country. But the devoted\r\ncultivators of _science_, in the United States, are comparatively\r\nfew; they are, however, rapidly increasing in number. Among them\r\nare persons distinguished for their capacity and attainments,\r\nand notwithstanding the local feelings nourished by our state\r\nsovereignties, and the rival claims of several of our larger\r\ncities, there is evidently a predisposition towards a concentration\r\nof effort, from which we may hope for the happiest results, with\r\nregard to the advancement of both the science and the reputation of\r\nour country.\r\n\r\nIs it not, therefore, desirable to furnish some rallying point,\r\nsome object sufficiently interesting to be compassed by common\r\nefforts, and thus to become the basis of an enduring, common\r\ninterest? To produce these efforts, and to excite this interest,\r\nnothing, perhaps, bids fairer than a SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL. Hitherto\r\nnearly all our exertions, of this kind, have been made by medical\r\ngentlemen, and directed primarily to medical objects. We are\r\nneither ignorant nor forgetful of the merits of our various MEDICAL\r\nJOURNALS, nor of the zeal with which, as far as consistent with\r\ntheir main object, they have fostered the physical sciences. We are\r\naware, also, that Journals have been established, _professedly_\r\nderiving their materials principally from foreign sources; that our\r\nvarious literary Magazines and Reviews have given, and continue to\r\ngive, some notices of physical and mathematical subjects, and that\r\nsome of them seem even partial to these branches of knowledge: that\r\nvarious limited efforts have been made, and are still making, to\r\npublish occasional or periodical papers, devoted to mathematical or\r\nphysical subjects, and that even our newspapers sometimes contain\r\nscientific intelligence. We are aware, also, that some of our\r\nacademies and societies of natural history, either in Journals of\r\ntheir own, or through the medium of existing magazines, communicate\r\nto the public the efforts of their members in various branches of\r\nnatural science.\r\n\r\nBut all these facts go only to prove the strong tendency which\r\nexists in this country towards the cultivation of physical science,\r\nand the inadequacy of the existing means for its effectual\r\npromulgation.\r\n\r\nAlthough our limits do not permit us, however much inclined, to be\r\nmore particular in commemorating the labours and in honouring the\r\nperformances (often marked by much ability) of our predecessors and\r\ncotemporaries, there is one effort which we are not willing to pass\r\nby without a more particular notice; and we are persuaded that no\r\napology is necessary for naming the Journal of the late Dr. Bruce,\r\nof New-York, devoted principally to mineralogy and geology.\r\n\r\nNo future historian of American science will fail to commemorate\r\nthis work as our earliest _purely scientific_ Journal, supported by\r\n_original American communications_.\r\n\r\nBoth in this country and in Europe, it was received in a very\r\nflattering manner; it excited, _at home_, great zeal and effort\r\nin support of the sciences which it fostered, and, _abroad_, it\r\nwas hailed as the harbinger of our future exertions. The editor\r\nwas honoured with letters on the subject of his Journal, and with\r\napplications for it from most of the countries in Europe; but\r\nits friends had to regret that, although conducted in a manner\r\nperfectly to their satisfaction, it appeared only at distant\r\nintervals, and, after the lapse of several years, never proceeded\r\nbeyond the fourth number.\r\n\r\nThe hopes of its revival have now, unhappily, become completely\r\nextinct, by the lamented death of Dr. Bruce.[1]\r\n\r\nThis gentleman, with an accomplished education, with extensive\r\nacquirements in science, and great zeal for promoting it in his\r\nown country; advantageously and extensively known in Europe, and\r\nfurnished with a correct and discriminating mind, and a chaste,\r\nscientific taste, was so well qualified for the task which he had\r\nundertaken, that no one can attempt to resume those scientific\r\nlabours which he has now _for ever_ relinquished, without realizing\r\nthat he undertakes an arduous enterprise, and lays himself under a\r\nheavy responsibility. American science has much to lament in the\r\ndeath of Dr. Bruce.\r\n\r\nNo one, it is presumed, will doubt that a Journal devoted to\r\nscience, and embracing a sphere sufficiently extensive to allure\r\nto its support the principal scientific men of our country, is\r\ngreatly needed; if cordially supported, it will be successful, and\r\nif successful, it will be a great public benefit.\r\n\r\nEven a failure, in so good a cause, (unless it should arise from\r\nincapacity or unfaithfulness,) cannot be regarded as dishonourable.\r\nIt may prove only that the attempt was _premature_, and that our\r\ncountry is not yet ripe for such an undertaking; for _without the\r\nefficient support of talent, knowledge_, and _money, it cannot\r\nlong proceed_. No editor can hope to carry forward such a work\r\nwithout the active aid of scientific and practical men; but, at\r\nthe same time, the public have a right to expect that he will not\r\nbe sparing of his own labour, and that his work shall be generally\r\nmarked by the impress of his own hand. To this extent the editor\r\ncheerfully acknowledges his obligations to the public; and it will\r\nbe his endeavour faithfully to redeem his pledge.\r\n\r\nMost of the periodical works of our country have been short-lived.\r\n_This_, also, _may_ perish in its infancy; and if any degree\r\nof confidence is cherished, that it will attain a maturer age,\r\nit is derived from the obvious and intrinsic importance of the\r\nundertaking; from its being built upon permanent and momentous\r\nnational interests; from the evidence of a decided approbation of\r\nthe design, on the part of men of the first eminence, obtained in\r\nthe progress of an extensive correspondence; from assurances of\r\nsupport, in the way of contributions, from men of ability in many\r\nparts of the union; and from the existence of _such a crisis_ in\r\nthe affairs of this country and of the world, as appears peculiarly\r\nauspicious to the success of every wise and good undertaking.\r\n\r\nAs regards the subjects of this work, it is in our power to do\r\nmuch in the department of the natural history of this country. Our\r\nZoology has been more fully investigated than our mineralogy and\r\nbotany; but neither department is in danger of being exhausted. The\r\ninteresting travels of Lewis and Clark have recently brought to\r\nour knowledge several plants and animals before unknown. Foreign\r\nnaturalists frequently explore our territory; and, for the most\r\npart, convey to Europe the fruits of their researches, while but\r\na small part of our own productions is examined and described by\r\nAmericans: certainly, this is little to our credit, and still less\r\nto our advantage. Honourable exceptions to the truth of this remark\r\nare furnished by the exertions of some gentlemen in our principal\r\ncities, and in various other parts of the Union.[2]\r\n\r\nOur botany, it is true, has been extensively and successfully\r\ninvestigated; but this field is still _rich_, and rewards every\r\nnew research with some interesting discovery. Our mineralogy,\r\nhowever, is a treasure but just opened. That both science and\r\nart may expect much advantage from this source, is sufficiently\r\nevinced by the success which has crowned the active efforts of a\r\nfew ardent cultivators of this science: several new species of\r\nminerals have been added to it in this country; great numbers of\r\nAmerican localities discovered, and interesting additions made to\r\nour materials, for the useful and ornamental arts. The science\r\nof mineralogy is now illustrated by courses of lectures, and by\r\nseveral good cabinets in the different states. Among the cabinets,\r\nthe splendid collection of Colonel Gibbs, now in Yale College,\r\n(a munificent DEPOSIT for the benefit of his country,) _stands\r\npre-eminent_: it would be considered as a very noble cabinet in\r\nany part of Europe: and its introduction into the United States,\r\nand its _gratuitous_ dedication to the promotion of science, are\r\nequally advantageous to the community, and honourable to its\r\npatriotic and enlightened proprietor. Mineralogy is most intimately\r\nconnected with our arts, and especially with our agriculture.\r\n\r\nSuch are the disguises worn by many most useful mineral substances,\r\nthat an unskilful observer is liable to pass a thing by, as\r\nworthless, which, if better informed, he would seize with avidity;\r\nand, still more frequently, a worthless substance, clothed\r\nperhaps in a brilliant and attractive exterior, excites hopes\r\naltogether delusive, and induces expense, without a possibility of\r\nremuneration. A diffusion of correct knowledge on this subject is\r\nthe only adequate remedy for either evil.\r\n\r\nOur geology, also, presents a most interesting field of inquiry.\r\nA grand outline has recently been drawn by Mr. Maclure, with a\r\nmasterly hand, and with a vast extent of personal observation and\r\nlabour: but to fill up the detail, both observation and labour\r\nstill more extensive are demanded; nor can the object be effected,\r\ntill more good geologists are formed, and distributed over our\r\nextensive territory.\r\n\r\nTo account for the formation and changes of our globe, by\r\nexcursions of the imagination, often splendid and imposing, but\r\nusually visionary, and almost always baseless, was, till within\r\nhalf a century, the business of geological speculations; but this\r\nresearch has now assumed a more sober character; the science of\r\ngeology has been reared upon numerous and accurate observations\r\nof _facts_; and standing thus upon the basis of induction, it\r\nis entitled to a rank among those sciences which Lord Bacon's\r\nPhilosophy has contributed to create. Geological researches are now\r\nprosecuted, by actually exploring the structure and arrangement of\r\ndistricts, countries, and continents. The obliquity of the strata\r\nof most rocks, causing their edges to project in many places above\r\nthe surface; their exposure in other instances, on the sides or\r\ntops of hills and mountains; or, in consequence of the intersection\r\nof their strata, by roads, canals, and river-courses, or by the\r\nwearing of the ocean; or their direct perforation, by the shafts\r\nof mines; all these causes, and others, afford extensive means of\r\nreading the interior structure of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe outlines of American geology appear to be particularly grand,\r\nsimple, and instructive; and a knowledge of the important facts,\r\nand general principles of this science, is of vast practical use,\r\nas regards the interests of agriculture, and the research for\r\nuseful minerals. Geological and mineralogical descriptions, and\r\nmaps of particular states and districts, are very much needed in\r\nthe United States; and to excite a spirit to furnish them will form\r\none leading object of this journal.\r\n\r\nThe science of natural philosophy, with its powerful auxiliary,\r\nmathematics, and the science of chemistry, the twin sister of\r\nnatural philosophy, are of incalculable importance to this country.\r\nA volume would not suffice to trace their applications, and to\r\nenumerate the instances of their utility.\r\n\r\nAs one which may be allowed to stand, _instar omnium_, we may\r\nmention the steam engine; that legitimate child of physical and\r\nchemical science--at once more powerful than the united force\r\nof the strongest and largest animals, and more manageable than\r\nthe smallest and gentlest; raising from the bowels of the earth\r\nthe massy treasures of its mines, drawing up rivers from their\r\nchannels, and pouring them, in streams of life, into the bosom of\r\ncities; and, above all, propelling against the currents, the winds,\r\nand the waves of the ocean, those stupendous vessels, which combine\r\nspeed with certainty, and establish upon the bosom of the deep the\r\nluxuries and accommodations of the land.\r\n\r\nThe successful execution of this magnificent design was first\r\nwitnessed upon the waters of the Hudson, but is now imitated in\r\nalmost every civilized country; and it remains to be seen whether\r\nthey will emulate us by transporting, by the same means, and\r\nagainst the same obstacles, the most formidable trains of artillery.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical inventions of this country are numerous; many of\r\nthem are ingenious, and some are highly important. In no way can\r\na knowledge of them be so readily and extensively diffused as in\r\na scientific journal. To this object, therefore, a part of our\r\nlabours (should there be a call for it,) will be devoted, and every\r\nnecessary aid will be given by plates and descriptions.\r\n\r\nScience and art mutually assist each other; the arts furnish facts\r\nand materials to science, and science illuminates the path of the\r\narts.\r\n\r\nThe science of mathematics, both pure and mixed, can never cease\r\nto be interesting and important to man, as long as the relations\r\nof quantity shall exist, as long as ships shall traverse the\r\nocean, as long as man shall measure the surface or heights of the\r\nearth on which he lives, or calculate the distances and examine\r\nthe relations of the planets and stars; and as long as the _iron\r\nreign of war_ shall demand the discharge of projectiles, or the\r\nconstruction of complicated defences.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the whole circle of physical science is directly\r\napplicable to human wants, and constantly holds out a light to the\r\npractical arts; it thus polishes and benefits society, and every\r\nwhere demonstrates both supreme intelligence, and harmony and\r\nbeneficence of design in THE CREATOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. I. _Essay on Musical Temperament._[3]\r\n\r\nBy Professor FISHER, of Yale College.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is well known to those who have attended to the subject of\r\nmusical ratios, that a fixed scale of eight degrees to the octave,\r\nwhich shall render all its concords perfect, is impossible. It\r\nhas been demonstrated by Dr. Smith, from an investigation of all\r\nthe positions which the major, the minor, and the half-tone can\r\nassume, that the most perfect scales possible, of which there are\r\ntwo equally so, differing only in the position of the major and the\r\nminor tone above the key note, must have one Vth and one 3d too\r\nflat, and consequently the supplementary 4th and VIth too sharp,\r\nby a comma. In vocal music, and in that of perfect instruments,\r\nthis defect in the scale is not perceived, because a small change\r\nmay be made in the key, whenever the occurrence of either of those\r\nnaturally imperfect intervals renders such a change necessary\r\nto perfect harmony. But in instruments with fixed scales, such\r\nas the guitar, the piano-forte, and the organ, if we begin with\r\ntuning as many concords as possible perfect, the resulting chords\r\nabove-mentioned will be necessarily false in an offensive degree.\r\nHence it is an important problem in practical harmonics, to\r\ndistribute these imperfections in the scale among the different\r\nchords, in such a manner as to occasion the least possible injury\r\nto harmony.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the only nor the principal difficulty which\r\nthe tuner of imperfect instruments has to encounter. In order\r\nthat these instruments may form a proper accompaniment for the\r\nvoice, and be used in conjunction with perfect instruments, it is\r\nnecessary that music should be capable of being executed on them,\r\nin all the different keys in common use; and especially that they\r\nshould be capable of those occasional modulations which often occur\r\nin the course of the same piece. Now only five additional sounds\r\nto the octave are usually inserted for this purpose, between those\r\nof the natural scale, which, of course, furnish it with only three\r\nsharps and two flats. Hence, when a greater number of flats or\r\nsharps is introduced, the music can be executed only by striking,\r\nin the former case, the sharp of the note next below; and, in\r\nthe latter, the flat of the note next above. But as the diatonic\r\nsemitone is more than half the major, and much more than half the\r\nminor tone, if the additional sounds in the common artificial\r\nscale be made perfect for one of the above employments, they must\r\nbe extremely harsh for the other. Hence arises the necessity of\r\nadjusting the position of these five inserted sounds so that they\r\nmay make tolerable harmony, whichever way employed. A change in\r\nthese will require corresponding changes in the position of the\r\nseveral degrees of the natural scale; so that it is highly probable\r\nthat the best scheme of temperament will leave no concord, either\r\nof the natural or artificial scale, absolutely perfect.\r\n\r\nIn adjusting the imperfections of the scale, the three following\r\nconsiderations have been usually taken into view.\r\n\r\nI. One object to be aimed at is, to make the sum of the\r\ntemperaments of all the concords the least possible. Since\r\nexperience teaches us that the harshness of a given concord\r\nincreases with its temperament, it is obvious that of two systems\r\nwhich agree in other respects, the best is that in which the sum of\r\nthe temperaments is least.\r\n\r\nII. When other things are equal, the best adjustment of the\r\nimperfections of the scale is that which diminishes the\r\nharmoniousness of all the different concords proportionally. The\r\nsuccession of a worse to a better harmony, is justly regarded\r\nby several of the best writers on this subject, as one of the\r\nprincipal causes of offence to the ear, in instruments imperfectly\r\ntuned.\r\n\r\nIII. When different chords of the same kind are of unequally\r\nfrequent occurrence, there is an advantage, _cæteris paribus_, in\r\ngiving the greatest temperament to that which occurs most seldom.\r\nThis important consideration has indeed been neglected by Dr.\r\nSmith, in the systems which he recommends, both for his changeable\r\nand the common fixed scale; as it is, also, by the numerous\r\nadvocates of the system of equal semitones. But many authors on\r\ntemperament, and most instrument-makers, pay a vague regard to it.\r\nTheir aim has been, although in a loose and conjectural manner,\r\nto make the prominent chords of the simplest keys the nearest to\r\nperfection, whilst a greater temperament is thrown upon those\r\nwhich occur only in the more complex keys. Thus Dr. Young, in\r\nthe Philos. Trans. for 1800, recommends a scheme which increases\r\nthe temperament of the IIIds, on the key note of the successive\r\nkeys, as we modulate by fifths from C, nearly in arithmetical\r\nprogression. Earl Stanhope assigns as a reason for the small\r\ntemperament which is given to several of the IIIds in his system,\r\nthat they are on the tonic of the simpler keys. The irregularities\r\nin Mr. Hawkes's scheme may be traced to the same cause. And, with\r\nthe instrument-makers, it is a favourite maxim to lay the wolf, as\r\nthey term it, where it will be most seldom heard.\r\n\r\nBut if the above consideration deserves any weight at all, it\r\ndeserves to be accurately investigated. Not only ought the relative\r\nfrequency of different chords to be ascertained with the greatest\r\naccuracy, of which the nature of the subject is susceptible, but\r\nthe degree of weight which this consideration ought to have, when\r\ncompared with the two others above-mentioned, should be determined:\r\nfor it is plain that neither of them ought to be ever left out of\r\nview.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the principal design of the following propositions\r\nwill be to investigate the actual frequency of occurrence of\r\ndifferent chords in practice; and from this and the two other\r\nabove-mentioned considerations united, to deduce the best system of\r\ntemperament for a scale, containing any given number of sounds to\r\nthe octave, and particularly for the common Douzeave, or scale of\r\ntwelve degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION I.\r\n\r\n  All consonances may be regarded, without any sensible error in\r\n  practice, as equally harmonious in their kinds, when equally\r\n  tempered; and when unequally tempered, within certain limits, as\r\n  having their harmoniousness diminished in the direct ratio of\r\n  their temperaments.\r\n\r\nAs different consonances, when perfect, are not pleasing to the\r\near in an equal degree, some approaching nearer to the nature of\r\ndiscords than others, so a set of tempered consonances, _cæteris\r\nparibus_, will be best constituted when their harmoniousness\r\nis diminished _proportionally_. Suppose, for example, that the\r\nagreeable effects of the Vth, IIId, and 3d, when perfect, are as\r\nany unequal numbers, _a_, _b_, and _c_; the best arrangement of a\r\ntempered scale, other things being equal, would be, not that in\r\nwhich the agreeable effect of the Vth was reduced to an absolute\r\nlevel with that of the IIId, or 3d, but when they were so tempered\r\nthat their agreeable effects on the ear might be expressed by\r\n(_m_/_n_)_a_, (_m_/_n_)_b_, and (_m_/_n_)_c_.\r\n\r\nThat different consonances, in this sense, are equally harmonious\r\nin their kinds, when equally tempered, or, at least, sufficiently\r\nso for every practical purpose, may be illustrated in the following\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLet the lines AB, _ab_, represent the times of vibration of two\r\ntempered unisons. Whatever be the ratio of AB to _ab_, whether\r\nrational or irrational, it is obvious that the successive\r\nvibrations will alternately recede from and approach each other,\r\ntill they very nearly coincide; and, that during one of these\r\nperiods, the longer vibration, AB, has gained _one_ of the shorter.\r\nLet the points, A, B, &c. represent the middle of the successive\r\ntimes of vibration of the lower; and _a_, _b_, &c. those of the\r\nhigher of the tempered unisons. Let the arc AGN..VA be a part of a\r\ncircle, representing one period of their pulses, and let the points\r\nA, _a_, be the middle points of the times of those vibrations which\r\napproach the nearest to a coincidence. It is obvious that the\r\ndislocations _b_B, _c_C, &c. of the successive pulses, increase\r\nin a ratio which is very nearly that of their distances from A,\r\nor _a_. Now if the pulses exactly coincided, the unisons would be\r\nperfect; and the same would be equally true, if the pulses of the\r\none bisected, or divided in any other constant ratio, those of\r\nthe other; as clearly appears from observation. It is, therefore,\r\nnot the absolute magnitude, as asserted by Dr. Smith, but the\r\n_variableness_ of the successive dislocations, B_b_, C_c_, &c.\r\nwhich renders the imperfect unisons discordant; and the magnitude\r\nof the successive increments of these dislocations is the measure\r\nof the degree of discordance heard in the unisons.\r\n\r\nIf now the time of vibration in each is doubled, AC, _ac_, &c. will\r\nrepresent the times of vibration of imperfect unisons an octave\r\nbelow, and the successive dislocations will be C_c_, E_e_, &c.\r\nonly half as frequent as before. But the unisons AE, _ae_, will be\r\nequally harmonious with AB, _ab_; because, although the successive\r\ndislocations are less frequent than before, yet the coincidences\r\nC′_c′_, E′_e′_ of the corresponding perfect unisons are less\r\nfrequent in the same ratio.\r\n\r\nSuppose, in the second place, that the time of vibration is\r\ndoubled, in only one of the unisons, _ab_; and that the times\r\nbecome AB and _ac_, or those of imperfect octaves. These will also\r\nbe equally harmonious in their kind with the unisons AB, _ab_. For,\r\nalthough the dislocations C_c_, E_e_, &c. are but half as numerous\r\nas before, the coincidences of the corresponding perfect octaves\r\nwill be but half as numerous. The dislocations which remain are\r\nthe same as those of the imperfect unisons; and if some of the\r\ndislocations are struck out, and the increments of successive ones\r\nthus increased, no greater change is made in the nature of the\r\nimperfect than of the perfect consonance.\r\n\r\nIf, thirdly, we omit two-thirds of the pulses of the lower unison,\r\nretaining the octave _ac_ of the last case, we shall have AD,\r\n_ac_, the times of vibration of imperfect Vths, to which, and to\r\nall other concords, the same reasoning may be applied as above.\r\nIt may be briefly exhibited thus; since the intermission of the\r\ncoincidences C′_c′_, E′_e′_ of the perfect unisons, an octave\r\nbelow A′B′, does not render the Vth A′D′G′ _a′c′e′g′_ less perfect\r\nthan the unison A′_c′_  _a′c′_, each being perfect in its kind; so\r\nneither does the intermission of the corresponding dislocations\r\nC_c_, E_e_, of the tempered unisons, in the imperfect Vth, ADG,\r\n_aceg_, render it less harmonious in its kind than the tempered\r\nunison AB, _ab_, from which it is derived in exactly the same\r\nmanner that the perfect Vth is derived from the perfect unison.\r\n\r\nThe consonances thus derived, as has been shown by Dr. Smith,\r\nwill have the same periods, and consequently the same beats, with\r\nthe imperfect unisons. It is obvious, likewise, that they will\r\nall be equally tempered. Let _m_ AB, and _n_ _ab_, be a general\r\nexpression for the times of vibration of any such consonance. The\r\ntempering ratio of an imperfect consonance is always found by\r\ndividing the ratio of the vibrations of the imperfect by that of\r\nthe corresponding perfect consonance. But\r\n\r\n(mAB)/(nab) ÷ m/n = AB/ab;\r\n\r\nwhich is evidently the tempering ratio of the imperfect unisons.\r\n\r\nHence, so far as any reasoning, founded on the abstract nature\r\nof coexisting pulses can be relied on, (for, in a case of this\r\nkind, rigid demonstration can scarcely be expected,) we are led\r\nto conclude that the harmoniousness of different consonances is\r\nproportionally diminished when they are equally tempered.\r\n\r\nThe remaining part of the proposition, viz. that consonances\r\ndifferently tempered have their harmoniousness diminished, or their\r\nharshness increased, in the direct ratio of their temperaments,\r\nwill be evident, when we consider that the temperament of any\r\nconsonance is the sole cause of its harshness, and that the effect\r\nought to be proportioned to its adequate cause. We may add, that\r\nthe rapidity of the beats, in a given consonance, increases very\r\nnearly in the ratio of the temperament; and universal experience\r\nshows, that increasing the rapidity of the beats of the same\r\nconsonance, increases its harshness. This is on the supposition\r\nthat the consonance is not varied so much as to interfere with any\r\nother whose ratio is equally simple.\r\n\r\n_Cor._ We may hence infer, that in every system of temperament\r\nwhich preserves the octaves perfect, each consonance is equally\r\nharmonious, in its kind, with its complement to the octave, and its\r\ncompounds with octaves. For the tempering ratio of the complement\r\nof any concord to the octave, is the same with that of the concord\r\nitself, differing only in its sign, which does not sensibly affect\r\nthe harmony or the rate of beating; while the tempering ratio of\r\nthe compounds with octaves is not only the same, but with the same\r\nsign.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scholium 1._\r\n\r\nThere is no point in harmonics, concerning which theorists have\r\nbeen more divided in opinion than in regard to the true measure of\r\nequal harmony, in consonances of different kinds. Euler maintains,\r\nthat the more simple a consonance is, the less temperament it\r\nwill bear; and this seems to have ever been the general opinion\r\nof practical musicians.[4] Dr. Smith, on the contrary, asserts,\r\nand has attempted to demonstrate, that the simpler will bear a\r\nmuch greater temperament than the more complex consonances. The\r\nforegoing proposition has, at least, the merit of taking the middle\r\nground between these discordant opinions. If admitted, it will\r\ngreatly simplify the whole subject, and will reduce the labour of\r\nrendering all the concords in three octaves as equally harmonious\r\nas possible, which occupies so large a portion of Dr. Smith's\r\nvolume, to a single short proposition. Dr. Smith's measure of\r\nequal harmony, viz. equal numbers of short cycles in the intervals\r\nbetween the successive beats, seems designed, not to render the\r\ndifferent consonances proportionally harmonious, but to reduce\r\nthe simpler to an absolute level, in point of agreeableness, with\r\nthe more complex; which, as has been shown, is not the object to\r\nbe aimed at in adjusting their comparative temperaments. But,\r\nin truth, his measure is far more favourable to the complex\r\nconsonances than equal harmony, even in this sense, would require;\r\nand, in a great number of instances, leads to the grossest\r\nabsurdities. Two consonances, according to him, are equally\r\nharmonious, when their temperaments are inversely as the products\r\nof the least numbers expressing their perfect ratio. If so, the\r\nVIII + 3d, whose ratio is 5/12, when tempered 1/20 of a comma, and\r\nthe unison, whose ratio is 1/1, when tempered 3 commas, are equally\r\nharmonious. But all who have the least experience in tempered\r\nconsonances will pronounce, at once, that the former could scarcely\r\nbe distinguished by the nicest ear from the corresponding perfect\r\nconcord, while the latter would be a most offensive discord. One\r\ninstance more shall suffice. The temperaments to render the VIII +\r\nVth, and the VIII + 6th equally harmonious, are laid down in his\r\ntables to be as 80 : 3. We will now suppose an instrument perfectly\r\ntuned in Dr. Smith's manner, and furnished with all the additional\r\nsounds which constitute his changeable scale. In this system,\r\nthe IIIds, and consequently the VIII + 6ths, are tempered 1/9 of\r\na comma; which, so far from being offensive, will be positively\r\nagreeable to the ear. This cannot be doubted by those who admit\r\nthat the VIII + 6ths in the common imperfect scales, when tempered\r\nat a medium nearly seven times as much, make tolerable harmony.\r\nYet, according to the theory which we are opposing, the VIII + Vth\r\nwill be equally harmonious when tempered nearly a minor semitone.\r\nNow let any one, even with the common instruments, whenever an VIII\r\n+ Vth occurs, strike the semitone next above or below: for example,\r\ninstead of playing C, _g_, let him play C, _g_♯; instead of A, _e_,\r\nlet him play A, _e_♭, &c. and compare the harmony of these with\r\nthat of the VIII + 6ths, if he wants any farther evidence that Dr.\r\nSmith's measure of equal harmony is without foundation.\r\n\r\nIt may be thought, that even the measure of equal harmony laid\r\ndown in the proposition, is more favourable to the complex\r\nconsonances than the conclusions of experience will warrant. But\r\nwhen it is asserted by practical musicians, that the octave will\r\nbear less tempering than the Vth, the Vth less than the IIId, &c.,\r\nthey doubtless intend to estimate the temperament by the rate of\r\nbeating, and to imply, that when different consonances to the same\r\nbase are made to beat equally fast, the simpler are more offensive\r\nthan the more complex consonances. This is entirely consistent\r\nwith the proposition; for when equally tempered, the more complex\r\nconsonances will beat more rapidly than the more simple; if on the\r\nsame base, very nearly in the ratio of their major terms. (Smith's\r\nHar. Prop. XI. Cor. 4.) If, for example, an octave, a Vth, and a\r\nIIId on the same base were made to beat with a rapidity which is\r\nas the numbers 2, 3, and 5, no unprejudiced ear would probably\r\npronounce the octave less harmonious in its kind than the IIId.\r\n\r\nTo those, on the other hand, who may incline to a measure of equal\r\nharmony between that laid down in the proposition and that of\r\nDr. Smith, on account of the rapidity of the beats of the more\r\ncomplex consonances, it maybe sufficient to reply, that if the\r\nbeats of a more complex consonance are more rapid than those of a\r\nsimpler one, when both are equally tempered, those of the latter,\r\ncæteris paribus, are more _distinct_. It is the distinctness of the\r\nundulations, in tempered consonances, which is one of the principal\r\ncauses of offence to the ear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scholium 2._\r\n\r\nIt will be proper to explain, in this place, the notation of\r\nmusical intervals, which will be adopted in the following pages.\r\nIt is well known that musical intervals are as the logarithms\r\nof their corresponding ratios. If, therefore, the octave be\r\nrepresented by .30103, the log. of 2, the value of the Vth will be\r\nexpressed by .17509; that of the major tone by .05115; that of the\r\ncomma by .00540, &c. But in order to avoid the prefixed ciphers,\r\nin calculations where so small intervals as the temperaments of\r\ndifferent concords are concerned, we will multiply each of these\r\nvalues by 100,000, which will give a set of integral values having\r\nthe same ratio. The octave will now become 30103, the comma 540,\r\n&c.; and, in general, when temperaments are hereafter expressed by\r\nnumbers, they are to be considered as so many 540ths of a comma.\r\nHad more logarithmic places been taken, the intervals would have\r\nbeen expressed with greater accuracy; but it was supposed that the\r\nadditional accuracy would not compensate for the increased labour\r\nof computation which it would occasion. This notation has been\r\nadopted by Dr. Robinson, in the article Temperament, (Encyc. Brit.\r\nSupplement;) and for every practical purpose, is as much superior\r\nto that proposed by Mr. Farey, in parts of the Schisma, lesser\r\nfraction and minute,[5] as all decimal measures necessarily are, to\r\nthose which consist of different denominations.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION II.\r\n\r\n  In adjusting the imperfections of the scale, so as to render\r\n  all the consonances as equally harmonious as possible, only the\r\n  simple consonances, such as the Vth, IIId, and 3d, with their\r\n  complements to and compounds with the octave, can be regarded.\r\n\r\nIt has been generally assigned as the reason for neglecting the\r\nconsonances, usually termed discords, in ascertaining the best\r\nscheme of temperament, that they are of less frequent occurrence\r\nthan the concords. This, however, if it were the only reason, would\r\nlead us, not to neglect them entirely, but merely to give them a\r\nless degree of influence than the concords, in proportion as they\r\nare less used.\r\n\r\nA consideration which seems not to have been often noticed, renders\r\nit impossible to pay them any regard in harmonical computations.\r\nAll such computations must proceed on the supposition that within\r\nthe limits to which the temperaments of the different consonances\r\nextend, they become harsher as their temperaments are increased.\r\nIt is evident that any consonance may be tempered so much as to\r\nbecome better by having its temperament increased, in consequence\r\nof its approaching as near to some other perfect ratio, the terms\r\nof which are equally small; or perhaps much nearer some perfect\r\nratio whose terms are not proportionally larger. For example,\r\nafter we have sharpened the Vth more than 3 commas, it becomes\r\nmore harmonious, as approaching much nearer to the perfect ratio\r\n5/6. In this, however, and the other concords, the value of the\r\nnearest perfect ratios in small numbers, varies so much from the\r\nratios of these concords, and the consequent limits within which\r\nthe last part of Prop. I. holds true, are so wide that there is no\r\nhazard in making it a basis of calculation. And if there be a few\r\nexceptions to this, in some systems, in which the temperaments of a\r\nfew of the concords become so large as to approach nearer to some\r\nother perfect ratio, whose terms are nearly as small as those of\r\nthe perfect concord, although they might become more harmonious, by\r\nhaving their temperament increased, yet their effect in _melody_\r\nwould be still more impaired; so that the concords may all be\r\nconsidered as subjected to the same rule of calculation.\r\n\r\nBut the limits within which the second part of Prop. I. holds\r\ntrue, with regard to the more complex consonances, are much more\r\nlimited. We cannot, for instance, sharpen the 7th, whose ratio is\r\n9 : 16 more than ½ a comma, without rendering it more harmonious,\r\nas approaching nearer another perfect ratio which is simpler; that\r\nof 5 : 9. Yet the difference between these two 7ths is so trifling\r\nthat they have never received distinct names; and, indeed, their\r\neffect on the ear in melody would not be sensibly different.\r\n\r\nAgain, the 5th, whose perfect ratio has been generally laid down as\r\n45 : 64, but which is in reality 25 : 36,[6] cannot be sharpened\r\nmore than ⅓ of a comma, before it becomes more harmonious by\r\nhaving its temperament increased, as approaching nearer the simpler\r\nratio 7 : 10. At the same time, the effect of this interval in\r\nmelody would not be sensibly varied. The limits, within which the\r\nharmoniousness of the IVth is inversely as its temperament, are\r\nstill narrower.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that no inference can be drawn from the\r\ntemperaments of such consonances as the 7th, 5th, IVth, &c.\r\nrespecting their real harmoniousness. The other perfect ratios\r\nwhich have nearly the same value with those of these chords,\r\nand which are in equally simple terms, are so numerous that by\r\nincreasing their temperament they alternately become more and\r\nless harmonious; and in a manner so irregular, that to attempt to\r\nsubject them to calculation, with the concords, would be in vain.\r\nEven when unaltered, they may be considered either as greater\r\ntemperaments of more simple, or less temperaments of more complex\r\nratios. Suppose the 5th, for example, to be flattened ⅕ of a comma:\r\nshall it be considered as deriving its character from the perfect\r\nratio 25 : 36, and be regarded as flattened 108; or shall it be\r\nreferred to the perfect ratio 7 : 10, and considered as sharpened\r\n239? No one can tell.--On the whole, it is manifest that no\r\nconsonances more complex than those included in the proposition,\r\ncan be regarded in adjusting the temperaments of the scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION III.\r\n\r\n  The best scale of sounds, which renders the harmony of all the\r\n  concords as nearly equal as possible, is that in which the Vths\r\n  are flattened 2/7, and the IIIds and 3ds, each 1/7 of a comma.\r\n\r\nThe octave must be kept perfect, for reasons which have satisfied\r\nall theoretical and practical harmonists, how widely soever\r\ntheir opinions have differed in other respects. Admitting equal\r\ntemperament to be the measure of equal harmony, the complements\r\nof the Vth, IIId, and 3d, to the octave, and their compounds with\r\noctaves will be equally harmonious in their kinds with these\r\nconcords respectively; according to the corollary of Prop I.\r\n\r\nHence we have only to find those temperaments of the Vths, IIIds,\r\nand 3ds, in the compass of one octave, which will render them all,\r\nas nearly as possible, equally harmonious. The temperaments of the\r\ndifferent concords of the same name ought evidently to be rendered\r\nequal; since, otherwise, their harmony cannot be equal. This can\r\nbe effected only by rendering the major and minor tones equal, and\r\npreserving the equality of the two semitones. If this is done, the\r\ntemperament of all the IIIds will be equal, since they will each\r\nbe the sum of two equal tones. For a similar reason the 3ds, and\r\nconsequently the Vths, formed by the addition of IIIds, and 3ds,\r\nwill be equally tempered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    x - c     x    (3c - 5x)/2   x - c     x    x - c    (3c - 5x)/2\r\n  |--------|-----|-------------|--------|-----|--------|-------------|\r\n  C        D     E             F        G     A        B             c\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the octave to five equal and variable tones, and\r\ntwo equal and variable semitones, we will suppose the intervals of\r\nthe untempered octave to be represented by the parts CD, DE, &c.\r\nof the line C_c_. Denoting the comma by _c_, we will suppose the\r\ntone DE, which is naturally minor, to be increased by any variable\r\nquantity, _x_; then, by the foregoing observations, the other minor\r\ntone, GA, must be increased by the same quantity. As the major\r\ntones must be rendered equal to the minor, their increment will be\r\n_x_ - _c_. As the octave is to be perfect, the variation of the two\r\nsemitones must be the same with that of the five tones, with the\r\ncontrary sign; and as they are to be equally varied, the decrement\r\nof each will be (5_x_ - 3_c_)/2; or what amounts to the same thing,\r\nthe increment of each will be (3_c_ - 5_x_)/2.\r\n\r\nThe several concords of the same name in this octave are now\r\naffected with equal and variable temperaments. The common increment\r\nof the IIIds will be 2_x_ - _c_; that of the 3ds ½ · (_c_ -\r\n3_x_); and consequently that of the Vths ½ · (_x_ - _c_).\r\n\r\nIn adjusting these variable temperaments, so as to render the\r\nharmony of the concords of _different_ kinds, as nearly equal as\r\npossible, we immediately discover that, as the Vth is composed\r\nof the IIId and 3d, the temperaments of the three cannot all be\r\nequal. When the temperaments of the IIId and 3d have the same\r\nsign, that of the Vths must be equal to their sum; and, when they\r\nhave contrary signs, to their difference. Hence the temperament\r\nof one of these three concords is necessarily equal to the sum\r\nof that of the other two. This being fixed, the temperaments,\r\nand consequently, (by Prop. I.) the discordance of the different\r\nconsonances is the most equably divided possible, when the two\r\nsmaller temperaments, whose sum is equal to the greater, are made\r\nequal to each other. The problem contains three cases.\r\n\r\n1. When the temperaments of the IIId and 3d have the same sign,\r\nthey ought to be equal to each other. Making\r\n\r\n2x - c = ½ · (c - 3x), we obtain x = 3/7 c,\r\n\r\nwhich, substituted in the general expressions for the temperaments\r\nof the Vth, IIId, and 3d, makes their increments equal to -2/7 _c_,\r\n-1/7 _c_, -1/7 _c_, respectively.\r\n\r\n2. Let the temperaments of the IIId and 3d have contrary signs: and\r\nfirst, let that of the IIIds be the greater. Then the former ought\r\nto be double of the latter, in order that the temperament of the\r\nVths and and 3ds may be equal. Hence we have\r\n\r\n2x - c = - 2 · ½ · (c - 3x); whence x is found = 0;\r\n\r\nand by substitution as before, the required temperament of the IIId\r\n= - _c_; of the Vth - ½_c_, and of the 3d ½_c_.\r\n\r\n3. Let the temperaments of the IIId and 3d have contrary signs, as\r\nbefore; and let that of the 3d be the greater.\r\n\r\nMaking ½ · (c - 3x) = -2 · (2x - c), we obtain x = 3/5 c;\r\n\r\nwhich gives, by substitution, the temperaments of the 3d, Vth, and\r\nIIId - 2/5 _c_, - 1/5 _c_, and 1/5 _c_, respectively.\r\n\r\nEach of these results makes the harmony of all the consonances as\r\nnearly equal as possible; but as the sum of the temperaments in\r\nthe first case is much the least, it follows that the temperaments\r\nstated in the proposition constitute the best scheme of intervals\r\nfor the natural scale, in which the harmony of all the different\r\nconsonances is rendered as nearly equal as possible.\r\n\r\n_Cor. 1._ In the same manner it may be shown that these\r\ntemperaments are the best, among those which approach as nearly as\r\npossible to equal harmony, for the _artificial_ scale; provided\r\nthat it is furnished with distinct sounds for all the sharps and\r\nflats in common use. By inserting a sound between F and G, making\r\nthe interval F♯G equal to either of the semitones found above,\r\nthe intervals, reckoned from G as a key note, will be exactly the\r\nsame in respect to their temperaments, as the corresponding ones\r\nreckoned from C. The same thing holds, whatever be the number of\r\nflats and sharps. It is supposed, however, that the flat of a note\r\nis never used for the sharp of that next below, or the contrary;\r\nand hence this scheme of temperament would only be adapted to an\r\ninstrument, furnished with all the degrees of the enharmonic scale;\r\nor, at least, with as many as are in common use.\r\n\r\n_Cor. 2._ This scale will differ but little in practice from the\r\none deduced, with so much labour, by Dr. Smith, from his criterion\r\nof equal harmony; which flattens the Vths 5/18, the IIIds 1/9, and\r\nthe 3ds 1/6 of a comma. The several differences are only 1/126,\r\n2/63, and 1/42 of a comma. Hence, as his measure of equal harmony\r\ndiffers so widely from that of Proposition I. we may infer that\r\nthe consideration of equalizing the harmony of the concords of\r\ndifferent names can have very little practical influence on the\r\ntemperaments of the scale. Should it, therefore, be maintained that\r\nthe criterion laid down in Prop. I. is not mathematically accurate;\r\nyet, as it must be allowed, in the most unfavourable view, to\r\ncorrespond far better with the decisions of experience than that\r\nof Doctor Smith, the chance is, that, at the lowest estimate,\r\nthe temperaments deduced from it approach much more nearly to\r\ncorrectness. Hence it is manifest that equal temperament may be\r\nmade, _without any sensible error in practice_, the criterion of\r\nequal harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scholium 3._\r\n\r\nAlthough the foregoing would be the best division of the\r\nmusical scale, if our sole object were to render the harmony\r\nof its concords as nearly equal as possible, yet the two other\r\nconsiderations, stated at the beginning of the essay, must by no\r\nmeans be neglected, as has been done by Dr. Smith. It seems to\r\nbe universally admitted, that the sum of the temperaments may be\r\nincreased to a certain extent, in order to equalize the harmony\r\nof the concords; otherwise the natural scale of major and minor\r\ntones, which makes the sum of the temperaments of the Vths, IIIds,\r\nand 3ds but 2 commas, ought to be left unaltered. Yet how far\r\nthis principle ought to be carried, may be a matter of doubt. If\r\nwe make the IIIds perfect, and flatten the Vths and 3ds each ¼\r\n_c_, according to the old system of mean tones, we shall have the\r\nsmallest aggregate of temperaments which admits of the different\r\nconcords of the same name being rendered equally imperfect; but\r\nthis amounts to 2½ commas. Thus far, however, it seems evidently\r\nproper to proceed. If we go still farther, and endeavour to\r\nequalize the harmony of the concords of _different_ names, it may\r\nbe questioned whether nearly as much is not lost as gained; for\r\nthe aggregate temperaments are increased, in Dr. Smith's scale,\r\nto 2⅔ _c_, and in that of the above proposition to 2-5/7 _c_. The\r\nsystem of mean tones, although more unequal in its harmony when\r\nbut two notes are struck at once, yet when the chords are played\r\nfull, as they generally are on the organ, never offends the ear by\r\na transition from a better to a worse harmony. For every _triad_ is\r\nequally harmonious; being composed of a perfect IIId, and a Vth and\r\n3d, tempered each ¼ _c_, or of their complements to, or compounds\r\nwith octaves, which, in their kinds, are equally harmonious.\r\n\r\nAgain, if different chords, in practice, vary in the frequency of\r\ntheir occurrence, this will be a sufficient reason for deviating\r\nfrom the system of equal temperament. Suppose, for example, that\r\na given sum of temperament is to be divided between two Vths, one\r\nof which occurs in playing ten times as often as the other: there\r\ncan be no doubt that the greater part of the temperament ought to\r\nbe thrown upon the latter. Hence it becomes an important problem to\r\nascertain, with some degree of precision, the relative frequency\r\nwith which different consonances occur in practice. Before\r\nproceeding to a direct investigation of this problem, it may be\r\nobserved, in general, that such a difference manifestly exists. In\r\na given key, it cannot have escaped the most superficial observer,\r\nthat the most frequent combination of sounds is the common chord\r\non the tonic; that the next after this is that on the dominant,\r\nand the third, that on the subdominant. Perhaps scarcely a piece\r\nof music can be found, in which this order of frequency does not\r\nhold true. It is equally true that some signatures occur oftener\r\nthan others. That of one sharp will be found to be more used, in\r\nthe major mode, than any other; and, in general, the more simple\r\nkeys will be found of more frequent occurrence than those which\r\nhave more flats or sharps. These differences are not the result\r\nof accident. The tonic, dominant, and subdominant, are obviously\r\nthe most prominent notes in the scale, and must always be the\r\nfundamental bases of more chords than either of the others; while\r\nthe greater ease of playing on the simpler keys will always be a\r\nreason with composers for setting a larger part of their music on\r\nthese, than on the more difficult keys. It is observable, that the\r\ngreater part of musical compositions, whether of the major or minor\r\nmode, is reducible to two kinds: that in which the base chiefly\r\nmoves between the tonic and its octave, and that in which the base\r\nmoves between the dominant and subdominant of the key. The former\r\nclass, in the major mode, are almost universally set on the key of\r\none sharp; the latter, generally on the natural key, or that of\r\ntwo sharps. In the minor mode, the former class have usually the\r\nsignature of two flats, or the natural key; the latter, that of one\r\nflat. Hence the three former keys will comprise the greater part\r\nof the music in the major mode, and the three latter, of that in\r\nthe minor mode, in every promiscuous collection. But if we were\r\neven to suppose each of the chords in the same key, and each of\r\nthe signatures, of equally frequent occurrence, some chords would\r\noccur much oftener, as forming an essential part of the harmony of\r\n_more keys_ than others. The Vth DA, for example, forms one of the\r\nessential chords of six different keys; while the Vth G♯D♯ forms a\r\npart only of the single key of four sharps.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION IV.\r\n\r\n  To find a set of numbers, expressing the ratio of the probable\r\n  number of times that each of the different consonances in the\r\n  scale will occur, in any set of musical compositions.\r\n\r\nThis can be done only by investigating their actual frequency\r\nof occurrence in a collection of pieces for the instrument to\r\nbe tuned, sufficiently extensive and diversified to serve as a\r\nspecimen of music for the same instrument in general. This may\r\nappear, at first view, an endless task; and it would be really\r\nsuch, were we to take music promiscuously, and count all the\r\nconsonances which the base makes with the higher parts, and the\r\nhigher parts with each other. But it appears, from Prop. I. Cor.\r\nthat all the positions and inversions of a chord, when the octaves\r\nare kept perfect, are equally harmonious with the chord itself. The\r\nVth, for example, which makes one of the consonances in a common\r\nharmonic triad, is equally harmonious in its kind, with the V +\r\nVIII, which takes its place in the 3d position of this triad, and\r\nwith the 4th in its second inversion. Hence, instead of counting\r\nsingle consonances, we have only to count chords; and this is done\r\nwith the greatest ease, by means of the figures of the thorough\r\nbase. The labour will be still farther abridged by reducing the\r\nderivative chords, such as the 6, the 6/4, &c. to their proper\r\nroots, as they are taken down. But even after these reductions,\r\nthe labour of numbering the different chords in a sufficiently\r\nextensive set of compositions, to establish, with any degree of\r\ncertainty, the relative frequency of the different signatures,\r\nwould be very irksome. A method, however, presents itself, which\r\nrenders it sufficient to examine the chords in such a set of pieces\r\nonly as will give their chance of occurrence in _two_ keys--a\r\nmajor, and its relative minor.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident to all who are much conversant with musical\r\ncompositions, that the _internal structure_ of all pieces in the\r\nsame mode, whatever be their signature, is much the same. There is\r\nscarcely more difference, for example, in the relative frequency\r\nof different chords in the natural key, and in that of two sharps,\r\nor two flats, than there is in different pieces on the same key.\r\nIf the Vth CG on the tonic has to the Vth EB on the mediant in\r\nthe natural key, any given ratio of frequency _m_ : _n_, the\r\nrelative frequency of the Vth DA on the tonic, and the Vth F♯ C♯\r\non the mediant in the key of two sharps, will not sensibly differ\r\nfrom that of _m_ : _n_. Hence, if we examine a sufficient number\r\nof pieces to establish the relative frequency of the different\r\nconsonances in one major and its relative minor key, and, by a much\r\nmore extensive investigation, ascertain the relative frequency\r\nof occurrence of the different signatures, it is evident, that\r\nby multiplying this last series of numbers into the first, and\r\nadding those products which belong to chords terminated by the same\r\nletters, we shall have a series of numbers expressing the chance of\r\noccurrence in favour of each of the consonances of the scale, when\r\n_all_ the keys are taken into view.\r\n\r\nIt was judged that 200 scores, taken promiscuously from all the\r\nvarieties of music for the organ,[7] would afford a set of numbers\r\nexpressing, with sufficient accuracy, the chance that a given\r\nconsonance will occur in a single major, and its relative minor\r\nkey. Accordingly 200 scores were examined, 150 in the major, and\r\n50 in the minor mode, (as it will appear hereafter that this is\r\nnearly the ratio of their frequency) of the various species of\r\nmusic for the organ, comprising a proper share both of the simpler\r\nand of the more rapid and chromatic movements. As the selecting and\r\nreducing to their proper keys all the occasional modulations which\r\noccur in the same piece would render the labour of ascertaining\r\nthe relative frequency of different signatures very tedious, it\r\nwas thought best to consider all those modulations which are too\r\ntransient to be indicated by a new signature, as belonging to the\r\nsame key. This will account for the occurrence of the chords in the\r\nfollowing table, which are affected by flats and sharps.\r\n\r\nThe minim, or the crotchet, was taken for unity, according to the\r\nrapidity of the movement. Bases of greater or less length had their\r\nproper values assigned them; although mere notes of passage, which\r\nbore no proper harmony, were generally disregarded. The scores were\r\ntaken promiscuously from all the different keys; and were reduced,\r\nwhen taken down, to the same tonic; the propriety of which will\r\nevidently appear from the foregoing remarks. The following table\r\ncontains the result of the investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE I.\r\n\r\n  +-------+---------------++---------------+---------------++-------------+\r\n  |       | Common Chords.||  Flat Fifths. |     7ths.     || 9-sevenths. |\r\n  |       +-------+-------++-------+-------+-------+-------++------+------+\r\n  |Bases. | Major | Minor || Major.| Minor.| Major.| Minor.||Major.|Minor.|\r\n  |       | mode. | mode. ||       |       |       |       ||      |      |\r\n  +-------+-------+-------++-------+-------+-------+-------++------+------+\r\n  |B III  |    5  |    8  ||   --  |   --  |    7  |   --  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |B      |    3  |   --  ||  163  |   55  |   11  |   17  ||   2  |  --  |\r\n  |B♭    |    4  |    4  ||   --  |   --  |   --  |   --  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |A VII  |   --  |   --  ||   --  |   --  |   --  |   --  ||   3  |  --  |\r\n  |A III  |   19  |    8  ||   --  |   --  |    7  |    2  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |A      |  166  |  588  ||    2  |    1  |   26  |    5  ||   2  |  --  |\r\n  |G♯     |   --  |   --  ||    3  |   38  |   --  |   --  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |G 3    |   18  |   15  ||   --  |   --  |   --  |   --  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |G      |  965  |   93  ||   --  |   --  |  178  |   15  ||   3  |  --  |\r\n  |F♯     |   --  |   --  ||   46  |    4  |   11  |    2  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |F      |  352  |   60  ||   --  |   --  |   11  |   12  ||   7  |   3  |\r\n  |E III  |   26  |  271  ||   --  |   --  |    1  |   25  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |E      |   32  |   25  ||    5  |    1  |    8  |   --  ||   1  |   4  |\r\n  |D♯ III |   --  |   --  ||    2  |    1  |   --  |   --  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |D♯     |   --  |   --  ||   --  |    4  |   --  |   --  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |D III  |   29  |    4  ||   --  |   --  |   49  |    7  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |D      |  120  |  129  ||   --  |   --  |   55  |   18  ||   6  |   1  |\r\n  |C♯     |   --  |   --  ||    2  |    4  |    1  |   --  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |C 3    |    2  |   --  ||   --  |   --  |   --  |   --  ||  --  |  --  |\r\n  |C      | 1769  |  275  ||   --  |   --  |    5  |    1  ||   4  |   1  |\r\n  +-------+-------+-------++-------+-------+-------+-------++------+------+\r\n\r\nThe following anomalous chords were found in the major mode, and\r\nare subjoined, to make the list complete:\r\n\r\n  8 ♯5ths on C, and 1 on D.\r\n  5 5/4ths on D, 2 on E, and 1 on G.\r\n\r\nThe left hand column of the foregoing table contains the\r\nfundamental bases of the several chords. When any number is annexed\r\nto the letter denoting the fundamental, it denotes the quality of\r\nsome other note belonging to the chord. E III, for example, denotes\r\nthat the various chords on E, which stand against it, have their\r\nthird sharped; G 3, that the third, which is naturally major, is\r\nto be taken minor, &c. Of the two columns in each of the four\r\nremaining pairs, the left contains the number of chords belonging\r\nto each root, of the kind specified at the top, which were found\r\nin 150 scores in the major mode; and the right, the corresponding\r\nresults of the examination of 50 scores in the minor mode. The\r\ndiminished triad, which is used in harmonical progression like the\r\nother triads, has its lowest note considered as its fundamental.\r\nThe diminished 7th, in the few instances in which it occurred, was\r\nconsidered as the first inversion of the 9/7th, agreeably to the\r\nFrench classification, and was accordingly reduced to that head.\r\n\r\nFrom this table, the number of times that each consonance of two\r\nnotes would actually occur, were the 200 scores played, is easily\r\ncomputed. We will suppose three notes, besides octaves, to be\r\nplayed to each chord. The octaves played it is unnecessary to\r\ntake into the computation, as it would only multiply the number\r\nof consonances whose temperament is the same, in the same ratio,\r\nand would have no effect on the _ratio_ of the numbers expressing\r\nthe frequency of the different consonances. In the chord of the\r\n7th, which naturally consists of four notes, we will suppose, for\r\nthe sake of uniformity, that one is omitted; and as the 7th ought\r\nalways to be struck, we will suppose the Vth and IIId of the base\r\nto be omitted, each half the number of times in which this chord\r\noccurs. Considered as composed of three distinct notes, neither\r\nof which is an octave of either of the others, each chord will\r\ncontain three distinct consonances. The common chord on C, for\r\nexample, will contain the Vth CG, the IIId CE, and the 3d EG. The\r\n9/7 on C will contain the VII CB, the IX, or (which must have the\r\nsame temperament) the IId CD, and the 3d BD. Reducing all these\r\nconsonances to their proper places, and adding those of the same\r\nname which have the same degree for their base, we obtain the\r\nfollowing results:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE II.\r\n\r\n  +--------++------------------++------------------++------------------+\r\n  |        || Vths, 4ths, and  || IIIds, 6ths, and || 3ds, VIths, and  |\r\n  | Bases. ||     Octaves.     ||      Octaves.    ||     Octaves.     |\r\n  |        |+------------------++------------------++------------------+\r\n  |        || Major. | Minor.  || Major.  | Minor. || Major. | Minor.  |\r\n  +--------++--------+---------++---------+--------++--------+---------+\r\n  |B       ||     8  |     8   ||    10   |     8  ||  1141  |   214   |\r\n  |B♭     ||     3  |      6  ||    22   |    19  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |A       ||   195  |   607   ||    22   |    10  ||   626  |   663   |\r\n  |G♯      ||  ----  |  ----   ||  ----   |  ----  ||    32  |   310   |\r\n  |G       ||  1088  |   116   ||  1090   |   125  ||    22  |    23   |\r\n  |F♯      ||  ----  |  ----   ||  ----   |  ----  ||    78  |    10   |\r\n  |F       ||   395  |    78   ||   486   |   301  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |E       ||    59  |   308   ||    40   |   284  ||  1828  |   308   |\r\n  |E♭     ||  ----  |  ----   ||     2   |  ----  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |D♯      ||  ----  |  ----   ||  ----   |  ----  ||     7  |     9   |\r\n  |D       ||   197  |   156   ||    60   |     7  ||   403  |   213   |\r\n  |C♯      ||  ----  |  ----   ||  ----   |  ----  ||    26  |    12   |\r\n  |C       ||  1807  |   278   ||  1959   |   870  ||     4  |     1   |\r\n  +========++========+=========++=========+========++========+=========+\r\n  |        || 5ths, IVths, and || 7ths, IIds, and  || VIIths, 2ds, and |\r\n  | Bases. ||     Octaves.     ||     Octaves.     ||     Octaves.     |\r\n  |        |+--------+---------++---------+--------++--------+---------+\r\n  |        || Major. | Minor.  || Major.  | Minor. || Major. | Minor.  |\r\n  +--------++--------+---------++---------+--------++--------+---------+\r\n  |B       ||   256  |   265   ||    25   |    17  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |B♭     ||  ----  |  ----   ||  ----   |  ----  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |A       ||     2  |     1   ||    34   |     7  ||     3  |  ----   |\r\n  |G♯      ||    10  |    53   ||  ----   |  ----  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |G       ||  ----  |  ----   ||   188   |    20  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |F♯      ||    74  |     7   ||     1   |     2  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |F       ||  ----  |  ----   ||  ----   |  ----  ||    17  |    16   |\r\n  |E       ||    10  |     1   ||    20   |    27  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |E♭     ||  ----  |  ----   ||  ----   |  ----  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |D♯      ||     7  |     5   ||  ----   |  ----  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |D       ||  ----  |  ----   ||   123   |    27  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |C♯      ||     9  |    10   ||     1   |  ----  ||  ----  |  ----   |\r\n  |C       ||  ----  |  ----   ||     5   |     1  ||    10  |     1   |\r\n  +--------++--------+---------++---------+--------++--------+---------+\r\n\r\nBesides the following chromatic intervals:\r\n\r\n               { 8 extreme sharp 5ths on C\r\n  Major mode.  { 1 --------------------- D\r\n               { 1 extreme flat 7th ---- G♯\r\n\r\n               { 4 extreme sharp 6ths on F\r\n  Minor mode.  { 4 extreme  flat 7ths on C♯\r\n               { 3 --------------------- G♯\r\n\r\nIt was thought best to exhibit a complete table of all the\r\nconsonances which occurred in the 200 scores examined; although\r\n(Prop. II.) only the concords in the upper half of the table can\r\nbe regarded in forming a system of temperament. For the more\r\nfrequent consonances, this table may be regarded as founded on a\r\nsufficiently extensive induction to be tolerably accurate. For the\r\nmore unfrequent chords, and especially for those which arise from\r\nunusual modulations, it expresses the chance of occurrence with\r\nvery little accuracy; and it is doubtless the fact that a more\r\nextensive investigation would include some chords not found at all\r\nin this list. But it must be recollected, on the other hand, that\r\nthe influence of these unusual chords on the resulting system of\r\ntemperament would be insensible, could their chance of occurrence\r\nbe determined with the greatest accuracy.\r\n\r\nBut none of the numbers in the foregoing table by any means\r\nexpresses the chance that a given interval will occur, considering\r\n_all_ the keys in which it is found. For example, the Vth CG on the\r\ntonic of the natural key, in music written on this key, is the one\r\nof most frequent occurrence, its chance being expressed by 1807;\r\nbut in the key of two flats, it becomes the Vth on the supertonic,\r\nand its chance of occurrence is only as 197. Hence the problem can\r\nbe completed only by finding a set of numbers which shall express,\r\nwith some degree of accuracy, the relative frequency of different\r\nsignatures.\r\n\r\nAn examination of 1600 scores, comprising four entire collections\r\nof music for the organ and voice, by the best European composers,\r\nbesides many miscellaneous pieces, afforded the results in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE III.\r\n\r\n  +-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n  | Signatures. | Major Mode. | Minor Mode. |\r\n  +-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n  |4♯_s_        |        42   |         2   |\r\n  |3♯_s_        |        95   |         6   |\r\n  |2♯_s_        |       200   |        13   |\r\n  |1♯           |       322   |        72   |\r\n  |♮            |       176   |       121   |\r\n  |1♭          |       180   |        97   |\r\n  |2♭_s_       |        70   |        77   |\r\n  |3♭_s_       |       116   |         8   |\r\n  |4♭_s_       |         0   |         3   |\r\n  +-------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n  |Ratio of their sums 1201   :       399   |\r\n  +-----------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThe chance of occurrence for any chord varies as the frequency\r\nof the key to which it belongs, and as the number belonging to\r\nthe place which it holds, as referred to the tonic, in Table II.,\r\njointly. Hence the chance of its occurrence in all the keys in\r\nwhich it is found, is as the sum of the products of the numbers in\r\nTable III., each into such a number of Table II. as corresponds to\r\nits place in that key. To give a specimen of the manner in which\r\nthis calculation is to be conducted, the numbers belonging to the\r\nmajor mode in the three first divisions of Table II. are first\r\nto be multiplied throughout by 176, which expresses the relative\r\nfrequency of the major mode of the natural key. They are then to\r\nbe multiplied throughout by 322, which expresses the frequency\r\nof the key of one sharp. But the first product, which expresses\r\nthe frequency of the Vth on the tonic, now becomes GD, and must\r\nbe added, not to the first, but to the fifth, in the last row of\r\nproducts. The product into 59, expressing the frequency of the\r\nVth on the mediant, becomes BF♯, an interval not found among the\r\nessential chords of the natural key. In general, the products\r\nof the numbers in Table III. into those in Table II. are to be\r\nconsidered as belonging, not to the letters against which these\r\nmultipliers stand, but to those which have the same position _with\r\nregard to their successive tonics_, as these have with regard to\r\nC. Whenever an interval occurs, affected with a new flat or sharp,\r\nit is to be considered as the commencement of a new succession of\r\nproducts. The IIId C♯E♯, for example, does not occur at all till\r\nwe come to the key of two sharps, and even then only in occasional\r\nmodulations, corresponding to the IIId on B in the natural key,\r\nwhose multiplier is 10. In the key of 3 sharps it becomes another\r\naccidental chord, answering to the IIId on E in the key of C, and\r\nconsequently has 40 for its multiplier. It is only in the key of\r\n6 sharps, that it becomes a constituent chord of the key; when if\r\nthat key were ever used, it would correspond to the IIId GB on the\r\ndominant of the natural key.\r\n\r\nAfter all the products have been taken and reduced to their proper\r\nplaces, in the manner exemplified above, a similar operation must\r\nbe repeated with the numbers in the second column of Table III. and\r\nthose in the second columns in the three first divisions of Table\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of keeping the major, and its relative minor key,\r\ndistinct, will be evident, when we consider that the several keys\r\nin the minor mode do not follow the same law of frequency as in the\r\nmajor; as is manifest from the observations in Schol. Prop. III.\r\nand as clearly appears from an inspection of Table III.\r\n\r\nBut in order to discover the relative frequency of the different\r\nchords on _every_ account, the results of the two foregoing\r\noperations must be united. Now, as the numbers in the two columns\r\nof Table II. at a medium, are as 3 : 1, and those in Table III.\r\nare in the same ratio, although the factors are to each other\r\nin only the simple ratio of the relative frequency of the two\r\nmodes, yet their products will, at a medium, be in the _duplicate_\r\nratio of that frequency. Hence, to render the two sets of results\r\nhomologous, so that those which correspond to the same interval may\r\nbe properly added, to express the general chance of occurrence for\r\nthat interval in all the major and minor keys in which it is found,\r\nthis duplicate ratio must be reduced to a simple one, either by\r\ndividing the first, or by multiplying the last series of results,\r\nby 3. We will do the latter, as it will give the ratios in the\r\nlargest, and, of course, the most accurate terms. Then adding those\r\nresults in each which belong to the same interval, and cutting off\r\nthe three right hand figures, (expressing in the nearest small\r\nfractions those results which are under 1000) which will leave a\r\nset of ratios abundantly accurate for every purpose; the numbers\r\nconstituting the final solution of the problem will stand as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IV.\r\n\r\n  +--------+----------+-----------+---------+\r\n  |        | Vths and | IIIds and | 3ds and |\r\n  | Bases. |   4ths.  |   6ths.   |  VIths. |\r\n  +--------+----------+-----------+---------+\r\n  |F♯      |      67  |       29  |    1072 |\r\n  |F       |     639  |      924  |      66 |\r\n  |E♯      |    ----  |     ----  |      12 |\r\n  |E       |     548  |      323  |    1151 |\r\n  |E♭     |     265  |      363  |       ½ |\r\n  |D♯      |       ⅓  |        ½  |     144 |\r\n  |D       |    1166  |      943  |     569 |\r\n  |D♭     |       1  |        6  |    ---- |\r\n  |C♯      |      25  |       12  |     581 |\r\n  |C       |     816  |     1131  |     180 |\r\n  |B♯      |    ----  |     ----  |       4 |\r\n  |B       |     221  |      135  |    1161 |\r\n  |B♭     |     418  |      654  |       5 |\r\n  |A♯      |    ----  |      ---- |      29 |\r\n  |A       |     870  |       568 |    1085 |\r\n  |A♭     |      52  |        78 |       ⅕ |\r\n  |G♯      |       5  |         4 |     365 |\r\n  |G       |    1207  |      1197 |     567 |\r\n  |F♯♯     |    ----  |      ---- |       ¼ |\r\n  |G♭     |    ----  |         ½ |    ---- |\r\n  +--------+----------+-----------+---------+\r\n\r\nNOTE. In this table, as well as the last, the Vths, IIIds, and\r\n3ds are to be taken _above_, and the 4ths, 6ths, and VIths, their\r\ncomplements to the octave, _below_ the corresponding degrees in\r\nthe first column. And, in general, whenever the Vths, IIIds, and\r\n3ds are hereafter treated as different classes of concords, each\r\nwill be understood to include its complement to the octave and its\r\ncompounds with octaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scholium._\r\n\r\nThe foregoing table exhibits, with sufficient accuracy, the ratio\r\nof the whole number of times which the different chords would\r\noccur, were the 1600 scores, whose signatures were examined,\r\nactually played in succession, on the keys to which they are set,\r\nand with an instrument having distinct sounds for all the flats\r\nand sharps. Had the examination been more extensive, the results\r\nmight be relied on with greater assurance as accurate; but the\r\ngeneral similarity, not only in the structure of different musical\r\ncompositions, but in the comparative frequency of the different\r\nkeys in different authors; is so great, that a more extensive\r\nexamination was thought to be of little practical importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART.

To this state of things\r\nwe are now fast approximating. The ardent curiosity regarding\r\nthese subjects, already enkindled in the public mind, the very\r\nrespectable attainments in science which we have already made, and\r\nour rapidly augmenting means of information in books, instruments,\r\ncollections, and teachers, afford ground for the happiest\r\nanticipations.\r\n\r\nThose sciences which require no means for their investigation\r\nbeyond books, teachers, and study--those which demand no physical\r\ndemonstrations, no instruments of research, no material specimens:\r\nwe mean those sciences which relate only to the intellectual\r\nand moral character of man, were early fostered, and, in a good\r\ndegree, matured in this country. Hence, in theology, in ethics,\r\nin jurisprudence, and in civil policy, our advances were much\r\nearlier, and more worthy of respect, than in the sciences relating\r\nto material things. In some of these, it is true, we have made\r\nvery considerable advances, especially in natural philosophy and\r\nthe mathematics, and their applications to the arts; and this\r\nhas been true, in some good degree, for very nearly a century.\r\nNatural history has been the most tardy in its growth, and no\r\nbranch of it was, till within a few years, involved in such\r\ndarkness as mineralogy. Notwithstanding the laudable efforts of a\r\nfew gentlemen to excite some taste for these subjects, so little\r\nhad been effected in forming collections, in kindling curiosity,\r\nand diffusing information, that only fifteen years since, it was\r\na matter of extreme difficulty to obtain, _among ourselves_,\r\neven _the names_ of the most common stones and minerals; and one\r\nmight inquire earnestly, and long, before he could find any one\r\nto identify even _quartz_, _feldspar_, or _hornblende_, among the\r\nsimple minerals; or _granite_, _porphyry_, or _trap_, among the\r\nrocks. _We speak from experience_, and well remember with what\r\nimpatient, but almost despairing curiosity, we eyed the bleak,\r\nnaked ridges, which impended over the valleys and plains that were\r\nthe scenes of our youthful excursions. In vain did we doubt whether\r\nthe glittering spangles of mica, and the still more alluring\r\nbrilliancy of pyrites, gave assurance of the existence of the\r\nprecious metals in those substances; or whether the cutting of\r\nglass by the garnet, and by quartz, proved that these minerals were\r\nthe diamond; but if they were not precious metals, and if they were\r\nnot diamonds, we in vain inquired of our companions, and even of\r\nour teachers, what they were.\r\n\r\nWe do not forget that Dr. Adam Seybert, in Philadelphia; Dr.\r\nSamuel L. Mitchill, in New-York; and Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse, in\r\nHarvard University, began at an earlier period to enlighten the\r\npublic on this subject; they began to form collections; Harvard\r\nreceived a select cabinet from France and England; and Mr. Smith,\r\nof Philadelphia, (although, returning from Europe fraught with\r\nscientific acquisitions, he perished tragically near his native\r\nshores,) left his collection to enrich the Museum of the American\r\nPhilosophical Society.\r\n\r\nStill, however, although individuals were enlightened, no serious\r\nimpression was produced on the public mind; a few lights were\r\nindeed held out, but they were lights twinkling in an almost\r\nimpervious gloom.\r\n\r\nThe return of the late Benjamin D. Perkins, and of the late Dr.\r\nA. Bruce, from Europe, in 1802 and 3, with their collections,\r\nthen the most complete and beautiful that this country had ever\r\nseen; the return of Colonel Gibbs, in 1805, with his extensive\r\nand magnificent cabinet; his consequent excursions and researches\r\ninto our mineralogy; the commencement, about this time, of\r\ncourses of lectures on mineralogy, in several of our colleges,\r\nand of collections by them and by many individuals; the return\r\nof Mr. Maclure, in 1807; his Herculean labour in surveying the\r\nUnited States geologically, by personal examination; and the\r\ninstitution of the American Journal of Mineralogy, by Dr. Bruce,\r\nin 1810;--these are among the most prominent events, which, in\r\nthe course of a few years, have totally changed the face of this\r\nscience in the United States.\r\n\r\nDuring the last ten years, it has been cultivated with great\r\nardour, and with great success: many interesting discoveries in\r\nAmerican mineralogy have been made; and this science, with its\r\nsister science, Geology, is fast arresting the public attention.\r\nIn such a state of things, books relating to mineralogy would of\r\ncourse be eagerly sought for.\r\n\r\nNo work, anterior to Kirwan, could be consulted by the student with\r\nmuch advantage, on account of the wonderful progress, which, within\r\nforty or fifty years, has been made in mineralogy. Even Kirwan,\r\nwho performed a most important service to the science, was become,\r\nin some considerable degree, imperfect and obsolete; the German\r\ntreatises, the fruitful fountains from which the science had flowed\r\nover Europe, were not translated; neither were those of the French;\r\nand this was the more to be regretted, because they had mellowed\r\ndown the harshness and enriched the sterility of the German method\r\nof description, besides adding many interesting discoveries of\r\ntheir own. It is true we possessed the truly valuable treatise\r\nof Professor Jameson, the most complete in our language. But the\r\nexpense of the work made it unattainable by most of our students,\r\nand the undeviating strictness with which the highly respectable\r\nauthor has adhered to the German mode of description, gave it an\r\naspect somewhat repulsive to the minds of novices, who consulted no\r\nother book. We are, however, well aware of the value of this work,\r\nespecially in the improved edition. It must, without doubt, be in\r\nthe hands of every one who would be master of the science; but\r\nit is much better adapted to the purposes of proficients than of\r\nbeginners.\r\n\r\nThe mineralogical articles dispersed through Aikin's Dictionary are\r\nexceedingly valuable; but, from the high price of the work, they\r\nare inaccessible to most persons.\r\n\r\nThe most recent of the French systems, that by Brongniart, seemed\r\nto combine nearly all the requisites that could be desired in an\r\nelementary treatise; and a translation of it would probably, ere\r\nthis, have been given to the American public, had we not been\r\nled to expect the work of Professor Cleaveland, which, it was\r\nanticipated, would at least possess one important advantage over\r\nthe work of Brongniart, and every other; it would exhibit, more\r\nor less extensively, _American localities_, and give the leading\r\nfeatures of our natural mineral associations.\r\n\r\nThus it appears[8] that the work of Professor Cleaveland was\r\neminently needed; the science, at large, needed it; and to American\r\nmineralogists it was nearly indispensable. It appeared too at a\r\nvery opportune moment. Had it come a few years sooner, it might\r\nnot have found many readers. Now it is sustained by the prevailing\r\ncuriosity, and diffused state of information regarding mineralogy;\r\nand, in turn, no cause could operate more effectually to cherish\r\nthis curiosity, and to diffuse this information still more widely,\r\nthan this book. Professor Cleaveland is therefore entitled to our\r\nthanks for undertaking this task; and, in this age of book-making,\r\nit is no small negative praise if an author be acquitted of\r\n_unnecessarily_ adding to the already onerous mass of books.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the PLAN of this work, Professor Cleaveland has,\r\nwith good judgment, availed himself of the excellencies of both the\r\nGerman and French schools.\r\n\r\nMr. Werner, of Fribourg, in some sense not only the founder of\r\nthe modern German school of mineralogy, but almost of the science\r\nitself, is entitled to our lasting gratitude for his system of\r\nexternal characters, first published in 1774. In this admirable\r\ntreatise he has combined precision and copiousness, so that exact\r\nideas are attached to every part of the descriptive language, and\r\nevery character is meant to be defined.\r\n\r\nIt is intended that a full description of a mineral upon this\r\nplan shall entirely exhaust the subject, and that although many\r\nproperties may be found in common among different minerals, still\r\nevery picture shall contain _peculiar_ features, not to be found\r\nin any other. It would certainly appear, at first view, that this\r\nmethod must be perfect, and leave nothing farther to be desired. It\r\nhas, however, been found in practice, that the full descriptions of\r\nthe Wernerian writers are heavy and dry; they are redundant also,\r\nfrom the frequent repetition of similar properties; and from not\r\ngiving due prominence to those which are peculiar, and therefore\r\ndistinctive, they frequently fail to leave a distinct impression\r\nof any thing on the mind, and thus, in the midst of what is called\r\nby the writers of this school a full _oryctognostic picture_, a\r\nstudent is sometimes absolutely bewildered.\r\n\r\nSome of the modern French writers, availing themselves of Mr.\r\nWerner's very able delineation of the external characters of\r\nminerals, have selected such as are most important, most striking,\r\ndistinctive, and interesting; and drawing a spirited and bold\r\nsketch, have left the minuter parts untouched: such a picture,\r\nalthough less perfect, often presents a stronger likeness, and more\r\neffectually arrests the attention.\r\n\r\nThis is the method of description which has been, as we think,\r\n_happily_ adopted, to a great extent by Mr. Cleaveland.\r\n\r\nMr. Werner, availing himself of the similarities in the external\r\nappearance of minerals, has (excepting the metals) _arranged_\r\nthem also upon this plan, without regard to their constitution;\r\nthat is, _to their real nature_, or, at least, making this wholly\r\nsubservient to the other: this has caused him, in some instances,\r\nto bring together things which are totally unlike in their\r\nnature, and, in other instances, to separate those which were\r\nentirely similar. Whatever may be said in favour of such a course,\r\nconsidered as a provisional one, while chemical analysis was in its\r\ninfancy, the mind can never rest satisfied with any arrangement\r\nwhich contradicts the real nature of things; in a word, the\r\ncomposition of minerals is the only correct foundation for their\r\nclassification. This classification has been adopted by several of\r\nthe ablest modern French writers.\r\n\r\n\"It is believed,\" (says Professor Cleaveland, Preface, p. 7.) \"that\r\nthe more valuable parts of the two systems may be incorporated, or,\r\nin other words, that the peculiar descriptive language of the one\r\nmay, in a certain degree, be united to the accurate and scientific\r\narrangement of the other.\r\n\r\n\"This union of descriptive language and scientific arrangement has\r\nbeen effected with good success, by BRONGNIART, in his System of\r\nMineralogy--an elementary work, which seems better adapted both to\r\ninterest and instruct, than any which has hitherto appeared. The\r\nauthor of this volume has, therefore, adopted the _general_ plan of\r\nBrongniart, the more important parts of whose work are, of course,\r\nincorporated with this.\"\r\n\r\nA happier model could not, in our opinion, be chosen; and we\r\nconceive that Professor Cleaveland is perfectly consistent, and\r\nperfectly perspicuous, when, adopting the chemical composition of\r\nminerals as the only proper foundation of arrangement, and, of\r\ncourse, rejecting the principle of Mr. Werner, which arranges them\r\nupon their external properties, he still adopts his _descriptive_\r\nlanguage as far as it answers his purpose. For to elect a principle\r\nof arrangement, and to classify all the members of a system so as\r\nto give each its appropriate place, is obviously quite a different\r\nthing from describing each member, after its place in a system is\r\nascertained. In doing the latter, characters may be drawn from any\r\nsource which affords them.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Introduction to the Study of Mineralogy,\" the author\r\nhas given a view at once copious, condensed, and perspicuous,\r\nof all that is necessary to be learned previously to the study\r\nof particular minerals. He begins with definitions and general\r\nprinciples, which are laid down with clearness.\r\n\r\nBy way of engaging the attention to the study of this department of\r\nnature, he remarks:\r\n\r\n\"From a superficial view of minerals in their natural depositories,\r\nat or near the surface of the earth, it would hardly be expected\r\nthat they could constitute the object of a distinct branch of\r\nscience. Nothing appears farther removed from the influence of\r\nestablished principles and regular arrangement, than the mineral\r\nkingdom when observed in a cursory manner. But a closer inspection\r\nand more comprehensive view of the subject will convince us, that\r\nthis portion of the works of nature is by no means destitute of the\r\nimpress of the Deity. Indications of the same wisdom, power, and\r\nbenevolence, which appear in the animal and vegetable kingdoms, are\r\nalso clearly discernible in the mineral.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may also be remarked,\" continues the author, \"that several\r\narts and manufactures depend on mineralogy for their existence;\r\nand that improvements and discoveries in the latter cannot fail\r\nof extending their beneficial effects to the aforementioned\r\nemployments. In fine, the study of mineralogy, whether it be viewed\r\nas tending to increase individual wealth, to improve and multiply\r\narts and manufactures, and thus promote the public good; or as\r\naffording a pleasant subject for scientific research, recommends\r\nitself to the attention of the citizen and scholar.\"\r\n\r\nThis introductory view of the importance and interest of the\r\nscience cannot be charged with the fault of exaggeration, since it\r\nis most evident that neither civilization, refinement in arts, nor\r\ncomfort, can exist where the properties of mineral substances are\r\nbut imperfectly understood.\r\n\r\nAs regards this country, the argument admits of much amplification.\r\nThe more our mineral treasures are explored, the more abundantly\r\ndo they repay the research; and we trust that the period is not\r\nfar distant, when we shall no longer ignorantly tread under our\r\nfeet minerals of great curiosity and value, and import from other\r\ncountries, at a great expense, what we, in many instances, possess\r\nabundantly at home.[9]\r\n\r\nBut to return to the plan of the author's work. Few persons,\r\nunacquainted with the science of mineralogy, would suspect that\r\nmere brute matter could exhibit many strong marks, capable of\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\nIt may, however, be confidently affirmed, that there is no mineral\r\nwhich, if carefully studied, may not be distinguished by characters\r\nsufficiently decisive from every other mineral; an account of these\r\ncharacters ought, therefore, to precede every system of mineralogy.\r\nProfessor Cleaveland has, with entire propriety, included them\r\nunder the heads of crystallography, physical and external\r\ncharacters, and chemical characters.\r\n\r\nHe has given a clear view of the Abbé Haüy's curious discoveries\r\nregarding the six primitive figures or solids which form the bases\r\nof all crystals--the three integrant particles or molecules which\r\nconstitute the primitive forms, and of the theory by which it is\r\nshown how the immensely numerous and diversified secondary or\r\nactual forms arise out of these few elementary figures.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly one of the most singular and acute discoveries\r\nof our age. It is true, there is a difference of opinion among\r\nmineralogists as to the practical use of crystallography in the\r\ndiscrimination of minerals. Some dwell upon it with excessive\r\nminuteness, and others seem restless and impatient of its details.\r\nThe truth seems to be, that those who understand it, derive from\r\nit (wherever it is applicable) the most satisfactory aid; and it\r\nrequires only a moderate knowledge of geometry to understand its\r\nprincipal outlines. On the other hand, it is no doubt possible,\r\nin most instances, to dispense with its aid, and to discriminate\r\nminerals by their other properties.\r\n\r\nOf the external and physical characters of Mr. Werner, Mr.\r\nCleaveland has given a clear account, combining into the same\r\nview the fine discriminations of the French authors, particularly\r\nregarding refraction, phosphorescence, specific gravity,\r\nelectricity, chatoyement, and magnetism. The same may be said of\r\nthe chemical characters. We do not know a more satisfactory and\r\nable view of the characters of minerals than Professor Cleaveland\r\nhas exhibited.\r\n\r\nWe would however ask, whether, in enumerating the kinds of lustre,\r\nthe term _adamantine_ should not be explained, as it is not\r\nunderstood by people in general, while the terms denoting the other\r\nkinds are _generally_ intelligible; whether in the enumeration of\r\nimitative forms, _lenticular_ and _acicular_ should not rather be\r\nreferred to the laws of crystallization; whether _reniform_ and\r\n_mamillary_ are synonymous; whether _sandstone_, as being a mere\r\naggregate of _fragments_, is a good instance of the _granular_\r\nfracture; whether in its natural state (at least the common ore of\r\nnickel) is _ever_ magnetic, till _purified_, and whether cobalt is\r\n_ever_ magnetic unless _impure_.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cleaveland's remarks on _fracture_ are uncommonly\r\ndiscriminating and instructive, and would lead a learner to a just\r\ncomprehension of this important point in the characters of minerals.\r\n\r\nThe section relating to the _chemical characters_ is concise,\r\nand professedly proceeds upon the principle of selection. It\r\nmight perhaps have been, to some extent, advantageously enlarged;\r\nalthough, it is true, the author refers us to the particular\r\nminerals for individual instances; still it might have been well\r\nto have illustrated the general principles by a few well-chosen\r\ninstances, _e. g._ how, by the blowpipe, _galena_ is distinguished\r\nfrom _sulphuret of antimony_; _carbonat of lead_ from _sulphat\r\nof barytes_, or _carbonat of lime_; _garnet_ from _titanium_;\r\n_plaster of Paris_ from _soapstone_, &c.; and, among trials in\r\nthe moist way, how by nitric acid and ammonia, _iron pyrites_ is\r\ndistinguished from _copper pyrites_; and how, by acids, _sulphat\r\nof lime_ is known from _carbonat of lime_. As the acids are used\r\nprincipally for trials on the effervescence of carbonats, most of\r\nwhich form with sulphuric acid, insoluble compounds, we should\r\ndoubt whether sulphuric acid is so advantageously employed as the\r\nnitric or muriatic, in such cases, on account of the clogging of\r\nthe effervescence by the thick magena, produced by a recently\r\nprecipitated and insoluble sulphat.\r\n\r\nAccording to our experience, the nitric or muriatic acid, diluted\r\nwith two or three parts of water, is most eligible.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the blowpipe: it is _a convenience_ to have a\r\nmouth-piece of wood, or ivory, joined to a tube of metal, as\r\nMr. Cleaveland recommends; and some authors direct to have the\r\ntube attached to a hollow ball, for the sake of condensing the\r\nmoisture of the breath; but every thing which adds to the expense\r\nand complication of the instrument will tend to discourage its\r\nuse; we have never found any difficulty in performing every\r\nimportant experiment with the common goldsmith's brass blowpipe;\r\nand are confident, that, after the learner has acquired the art,\r\nor _knack_, of propelling a continued stream of air from his\r\nmouth, by means of the muscles of the lips and cheeks, while his\r\nrespiration proceeds without embarrassment through the nostrils,\r\nhe will need no other instrument than the common blowpipe. Indeed\r\nit is a truly admirable instrument, instantly giving us the effect\r\nof very powerful furnaces, the heat being entirely under command,\r\nthe subject of operation and all the changes in full view, and the\r\nexpense and bulk of the instrument being such that every one may\r\npossess it, and carry it about his person.\r\n\r\nThe chapter on the principles of arrangement is worthy of all\r\npraise. This difficult subject is here discussed with such\r\nclearness, comprehensiveness, and candour, as prove the author to\r\nbe completely master of his subject; and we are persuaded, that,\r\non this topic, no author can be studied with more advantage.\r\nWe forbear to extract, because the whole should be attentively\r\nperused in connexion, and scarcely admits of abridgement. We\r\nentirely agree with Professor Cleaveland, as we have already\r\nsaid, that the chemical composition of minerals is the only just\r\nfoundation of their arrangement; that next in importance is the\r\ncrystalline structure, including a knowledge of the primitive\r\nform, and integrant molecule; and last and least important, _in\r\nfixing the arrangement_, are the external characters: these\r\nlast should be only provisionally employed, where the two first\r\nare not ascertained, or the second is not applicable. When the\r\narrangement is once made, we _may_, however, and we commonly\r\n_shall_, in _describing_ minerals, pursue precisely the reverse\r\norder; the external characters will usually be mentioned first,\r\nthe crystalline characters next, and the chemical last of all. In\r\ndescription, the external characters are often the most valuable;\r\nif judiciously selected and arranged, they will always prove of the\r\nmost essential service, and can rarely be entirely dispensed with.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the NOMENCLATURE of minerals, we feelingly unite\r\nwith Professor Cleaveland in deploring the oppressive redundancy\r\nof synonymes. Few minerals have only one name, and usually they\r\nhave several. With Count Bournon we agree, that the discoverer of\r\na mineral has the exclusive right of naming it, and that the name\r\nonce given should not be changed without the most cogent reasons.\r\nWhat then shall we say of the ABBÉ HAÜY, of whom, whether we\r\nspeak of his genius, his learning, his acuteness, his discoveries,\r\nhis candour, and love of truth, or his universally amiable and\r\nvenerable character, we can never think without sentiments of the\r\nhighest respect and admiration? More than any modern writer he has\r\nadded to the list of synonymes, often exchanging a very good name,\r\nderived perhaps from the locality or discoverer of a mineral, for\r\none professedly significant, but connected with its subject by a\r\nchain of thought so slight, that considerable knowledge of Greek\r\netymology, and still more explanation, is necessary to comprehend\r\nthe connexion; and thus, after all, it amounts, with respect to\r\nmost readers, only to the exchange of one arbitrary name for\r\nanother. What advantage, for instance, has _grammatite_, alluding\r\nto a line often obscure, and still oftener wholly invisible,\r\nover the good old name _tremolite_, which always reminds us of\r\nan interesting locality; how is _pyroxene_ better than _augite_,\r\n_amphibole_ than _hornblende_, _amphigene_ than _leucite_, or\r\n_disthene_ than _sappar_. Some of the Abbé Haüy's names are,\r\nhowever, very happily chosen, especially where new discriminations\r\nwere to be established, or errors corrected, or even a redundant\r\ncrop of synonymes to be superseded by a better name. _Epidote_\r\nis an instance of the latter, and the new divisions of the old\r\n_zeolite family_ into four species, _mesotype_, _stilbite_,\r\n_analcime_, and _chabasie_, afford a happy instance of the\r\nformer. It were much to be wished, that by the common consent of\r\nmineralogists, one nomenclature should be universally adopted: for\r\nits uniformity is of much more importance than its nature.\r\n\r\nIn expressing our approbation of the principles of arrangement\r\nadopted by Professor Cleaveland, we have of course espoused those\r\nof his TABULAR VIEW, which is perhaps as nearly as the state of\r\nscience will admit, erected upon a chemical basis, like that of\r\nBrongniart, to which it bears a close resemblance. Some of the\r\nsubordinate parts, we could have wished had been arranged in a\r\nmanner somewhat different. In the genus lime, it appears to us\r\nbetter to describe the species carbonat first; because, being very\r\nabundant, and its characters clear, it forms a convenient point\r\nof departure and standard of comparison, in describing the other\r\nspecies which have lime for their basis, and some of which are\r\ncomparatively rare. The same remark we would make upon quartz, and\r\nits concomitant, pure silicious stones. There appears to us a high\r\nadvantage in making these minerals clearly known first, before we\r\nproceed to those which are much more rare, and especially which\r\nare much harder, and possess the characters of gems. For example,\r\nif a learner has become acquainted with quartz, chalcedony, flint,\r\nopal, chrysoprase, and jasper, he will much more easily comprehend\r\nthe superior hardness, &c. and different composition of topaz,\r\nsapphire, spinelleruby, chrysoberyl, and zircon, which we should\r\nmuch prefer to see occupying a later, than the first place in a\r\ntabular arrangement; and, although topaz, by containing fluoric\r\nacid, appears to be in some measure assimilated to saline minerals,\r\nit is in its characters so very diverse from the earthy salts,\r\nthat we have fair reason to conclude that the fluoric acid does\r\nnot stamp the character; and, as it bears so close a resemblance\r\nto the ruby and sapphire, which evidently derive their principal\r\ncharacters from the argillaceous earth, we perhaps ought to infer\r\nthat this (the topaz,) does so too. Indeed Professor Cleaveland has\r\nsufficiently implied his own opinion, by giving these minerals a\r\njuxtaposition in his table, although the same reasons which induced\r\nthe placing of the topaz next to the earthy salts, could not have\r\njustified the placing of the sapphire there. On these points we are\r\nnot, however, strenuous; they are of more importance if the work\r\nbe used as a text-book for lectures, than as a private companion.\r\nWith respect to the _completeness_ of Professor Cleaveland's\r\ntabular view, we have carefully compared it with the third edition\r\nof Jameson's mineralogy; and although a few new species, or\r\nsub-species, and varieties have been added in this last edition,\r\nthey are in general of so little importance, that Professor\r\nCleaveland's work cannot be considered as materially deficient; and\r\nthe few cases in which it is so, are much more than made up by his\r\nentirely new and instructive views of American mineralogy, to which\r\nno parallel is to be found in any other book, and which give it\r\npeculiar interest to the American, and even to the European, reader.\r\n\r\nIn another edition, (which we cannot doubt will speedily be called\r\nfor,) he will of course add whatever is omitted in this, and we\r\nshould be gratified to see a good article on the subject of the\r\nærolites or stones which have fallen from the atmosphere. This\r\nsubject is one, in our view, of high interest; and although _in\r\nstrictness_ it may not claim a place in a tabular view of minerals,\r\n(we must confess, however, that we see no important obstacle to its\r\nbeing treated of under the head of native iron,) there can be no\r\nobjection to its being placed in an appendix. The fall of stones\r\nfrom the atmosphere is the most curious and mysterious fact in\r\nnatural history.\r\n\r\nIt may seem perhaps too trivial to remark, that the annexation of\r\nnumbers, referring to the pages, would be a serious addition to\r\nthe utility of the tabular view. Very few inadvertencies have been\r\nobserved--the following may be mentioned: _Amenia_, in the State of\r\nNew-York, is printed (by a typographical error we presume) Armenia;\r\nand _Menechan_, where the menechanite is found, is mentioned as\r\noccurring in Scotland, but it is in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nAuthors seem agreed that the black-lead ore is an altered carbonat,\r\nbut they seem not to have been so well agreed as to the nature\r\nof the blue-lead ore. In the cabinet of Colonel Gibbs, there are\r\nspecimens which appear satisfactorily to illustrate both these\r\nsubjects. The black-lead is by the blowpipe alone reducible to\r\nmetallic lead; there is one specimen in the cabinet referred\r\nto, which is blackened on what appears to have been the under\r\nside, and seemingly by the contact of sulphuretted hydrogen gas;\r\nthat which was probably the upper part remains unaltered, and is\r\nbeautiful white carbonat of lead; this appearance is the more\r\nstriking, because the piece is large and full of interstices, by\r\nwhich the gas appears to have passed through. The blue ore is in\r\nlarge six-sided prisms of a dark blue or almost black colour; where\r\nthe prisms are broken across, they present an unequal appearance;\r\nsometimes they are _invested_; and sometimes slightly, and at\r\nother times deeply, _penetrated_ by sulphuret of lead, having\r\nthe usual brilliant foliated fracture. The part which looks like\r\nsulphuret of lead is easily reducible by the blowpipe, but not the\r\nwhole crystal, as authors appear to imply; for if that part of the\r\ncrystal which does not present the appearance of galena is heated\r\nby the blowpipe flame, it is not reduced, but congeals into the\r\ngarnet dodecahedron, with its colour unaltered: these crystals\r\nare therefore phosphat of lead, and they appear to be either an\r\noriginal mixture of phosphat and sulphuret of lead, or the phosphat\r\nhas somehow in part given up its phosphoric acid, and assumed in\r\nits stead sulphur, perhaps from the decomposition of sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cleaveland will, of course, add new localities, even\r\nforeign ones, where they are interesting, and domestic ones, where\r\nthey are well authenticated. Among the former, we trust he will\r\nmention the lake of sulphuric acid contained in the crater of\r\nMount Idienne, in the Province of Bagnia Vangni, in the eastern\r\npart of Java, and also the river of sulphuric acid which flows\r\nfrom it and kills animals, scorches vegetation, and corrodes the\r\nstones.[10] Among American localities, we beg leave to mention\r\nviolet fluor spar, abundant and very handsome, near Shawnee Town,\r\non the Ohio, in the Illinois Territory, and galena, of which this\r\nfluor is the gangue;--sulphat of magnesia, perfectly crystallized,\r\nin masses composed of delicate white prisms, in a cave in the\r\nIndiana Territory, not very remote from Louisville, in Kentucky;\r\nit is said to be so abundant that the inhabitants carry it away by\r\nthe wagon load;--pulverulent carbonat of magnesia, apparently pure,\r\nfound by Mr. Pierce at Hoboken, in serpentine, where the hydrate of\r\nmagnesia was found;--chabasie, agates, chalcedony, amethyst, and\r\nanalcime, at Deerfield, by Mr. E. Hitchcock;--agates in abundance\r\nat East-Haven, near New-Haven, in secondary greenstone, like\r\nthe above-named minerals at Deerfield;--saline springs, covered\r\nwith petroleum, and emitting large volumes of inflammable gases,\r\nnumerous in New-Connecticut, south of Lake Erie;--magnetical\r\npyrites, abundant in the bismuth vein, at Trumbull,\r\nConnecticut:--very brilliant fine-grained micaceous iron, in large\r\nmasses near Bellows' Falls; yellow foliated blende, in Berlin,\r\nConnecticut, and near Hamilton College--the latter discovered by\r\nProfessor Noyes; it is in veins in compact limestone;--red oxid\r\nof titanium, often geniculated, at Leyden, in Massachusetts,\r\ndiscovered by Mr. E. Hitchcock;--red oxid of titanium, in very\r\nlarge crystals and geniculated, imbedded in micaceous schistus, at\r\nOxford, 20 miles north from New-Haven;--silicious petrifactions of\r\nwood, abundant in the island of Antigua, recently brought by Mr.\r\nPelatiah Perit, of New-York;--sulphuret of molybdena, at Pettipaug,\r\nand at East-Haddam, Connecticut;--prehnite abundant and beautiful,\r\nin secondary greenstone, at Woodbury, 24 miles north of New-Haven,\r\ndiscovered by Mr. Elijah Baldwin;--black oxid of manganese, in\r\ngreat abundance, and of an excellent quality, near Bennington,\r\nVermont, and plumose mica, in a very fine graphic granite, in a\r\nhill two miles north of Watertown, Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThe introduction to the STUDY OF GEOLOGY, deserves a more extended\r\nseries of remarks than it would now be proper to make, after so\r\nfull a consideration of the previous parts of the work.\r\n\r\nProfessor Jameson's elaborate exposition of the Wernerian system,\r\nis too full, and too much devoted to a particular system, for\r\nbeginners: the sketches of geology contained in the systems of\r\nChemistry by Murray and Thomson, and in Phillips's mineralogy,\r\nare too limited, although useful: the excellent account of\r\nthe Wernerian system, contained in an Appendix to Brochant's\r\nMineralogy, has, we believe, never been translated; and we need\r\nnot say that Professor Playfair's illustrations of the Huttonian\r\nTheory, De Luc's Geology, and Cuvier's Geology, are not well\r\nadapted to the purposes of a beginner; neither is Delametherie's,\r\nnor has it been translated. An introduction to geology was,\r\ntherefore, hardly less needed than one to mineralogy. Professor\r\nCleaveland has performed this difficult duty with great ability,\r\nand has brought this interesting branch of science fairly within\r\nthe reach of our students.\r\n\r\nAlthough adhering substantially to the Wernerian arrangement of\r\nrocks, he has, so to speak, blended Werner's three classes of\r\nprimitive, transition, and secondary rocks, into one class; and\r\nwhere the same rock occurs in all the three classes, or in two of\r\nthem, he mentions it in giving the history of the particular rock.\r\nThis method simplifies the subject very much to the apprehensions\r\nof a learner. A rigid Wernerian would probably revolt at it, but\r\nthe distinctions of Mr. Werner may still be pointed out, and, we\r\nshould think, ought to be, at least by all teachers.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Cleaveland's account of the trap rocks, we should almost\r\nimagine that some typographical error had crept into the following\r\nparagraph:\r\n\r\n\"But in modern geological inquiries, the word trap is usually\r\nemployed to designate a _simple mineral_, composed of hornblende\r\nnearly or quite pure, and also those aggregates in which\r\n_hornblende_ predominates. Hence, the _presence_ of hornblende, as\r\na predominating ingredient, characterizes those MINERALS to which\r\nmost geologists apply the name _trap_.\"\r\n\r\nNow, it is not accordant with our apprehensions that trap is ever\r\nat the present time employed to designate a _simple mineral_, nor\r\nhas Professor Cleaveland himself used it in his tabular view, or\r\nin his description of simple minerals. In our view, it is the\r\n_classical_ word of modern geology, to designate that description\r\nof rocks in which hornblende predominates, and perhaps a few others\r\nof minor importance usually associated with them. It is true, a\r\nrock composed of pure hornblende may be called trap, but it is not\r\ntrue, _vice versa_, that this rock, considered in its character of\r\na simple mineral, is called trap. If our views are correct, the\r\nsection which is headed _trap_ or _hornblende_, should be _trap_ or\r\n_hornblende rocks_, and greenstone should come in as a subdivision,\r\nand not form a distinct section. With these alterations, and with\r\nthe substitution of rock in the _first_, and rocks in the _second_\r\ninstance, in the paragraph above quoted, instead of _mineral_ and\r\n_minerals_, we apprehend the view of this family of rocks would\r\nbe much more clear, and a degree of confusion, which learners now\r\nexperience from the paragraph, would be prevented. If we are wrong,\r\nwe are sure Professor Cleaveland will pardon us; if right, his\r\ncandour will readily admit the correction.\r\n\r\nAs to the manner in which the work of Professor Cleaveland is\r\nexecuted, the remarks which we already made, have in a good degree\r\nanticipated this head.\r\n\r\nWe cannot, however, dismiss the subject without adding that, in our\r\nopinion, this work does honour to our country, and will greatly\r\npromote the knowledge of mineralogy and geology, besides aiding\r\nin the great work of disseminating a taste for science generally.\r\nOur views of the plan we have already detailed. The manner of\r\nexecution is masterly. Discrimination, perspicuity, judicious\r\nselection of characters and facts, and a style chaste, manly,\r\nand comprehensive, are among the characteristics of Professor\r\nCleaveland's performance. It has brought within the reach of\r\nthe American student the excellencies of Kirwan, Jameson, Haüy,\r\nBrochant, Brongniart, and Werner; and we are not ashamed to have\r\nthis work compared with their productions. In our opinion Professor\r\nCleaveland's work ought to be introduced into all our schools of\r\nmineralogy, and to be the travelling companion of every American\r\nmineralogist.\r\n\r\nWe trust that all cultivators of mineralogy and geology in this\r\ncountry, will willingly aid Professor Cleaveland in enlarging his\r\nlist of American localities for a second edition; and we hope\r\nthat he will repay them, at a future day, by giving us a distinct\r\ntreatise on geology, with as particular a delineation as possible\r\nof the geological relations of the great North American formations.\r\nMr. Maclure has, with great ability, sketched the outline; but much\r\nlabour is still needed in filling up the detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. III. _New Locality of Fluor Spar, or Fluat of Lime and of\r\nGalena, or Sulphuret of Lead._\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Joseph Baldwin, formerly of Connecticut, now residing near\r\nShawnee Town, in the Illinois Territory, has given us some\r\ninteresting specimens of fluor spar. They are found not far from\r\nShawnee Town, on the banks of the Ohio; and a few miles below\r\nwhere the Wabash joins the Ohio. The fluor forms the gangue of\r\na lead vein, and we have pieces in which the lead and fluor\r\nare intimately blended. The lead ore is the common galena, or\r\nsulphuret, with a broad, foliated, or laminated fracture, and a\r\nhigh degree of metallic splendour. We reduced it to the metallic\r\nstate, and it yielded a large product of very soft lead. On\r\ndissolving it in nitric acid, and applying the muriatic acid till\r\nprecipitation ceased, the precipitate formed was _all redissolved_\r\nby boiling water; nor, when submitted to cupellation did the lead\r\nleave any thing upon the cupel. We, therefore, conclude that it\r\ncontained no appreciable quantity of silver. It is said to be very\r\nabundant at Shawnee Town.\r\n\r\nThe fluor spar is very beautiful. Its colours, chiefly, very deep\r\npurple and violet; but still highly translucent; one specimen was\r\nentirely limpid. Both kinds, when thrown in coarse powder, on a\r\nred-hot shovel, in a dark place, phosphoresced, and the violet\r\nspecimens in a very striking manner. Of the violet kind, we have a\r\nspecimen nearly as large as a man's fist, which is perfectly pure\r\nand sound, and appears to have been a single crystal; the natural\r\nfaces and angles were unfortunately obliterated by grinding on a\r\ncommon grindstone. We have others which are decidedly crystals\r\nof perfect regularity; cubes, and passages between the cube and\r\noctahedron. In some of the specimens, the disposition of colours,\r\nand the transmission of light is such as to show very clearly that\r\nthe octahedron lies in the centre, as the nucleus or primitive form.\r\n\r\nThe size and beauty of the specimens, and the abundance of this\r\nmineral near Shawnee Town, (provided there is no mistake in the\r\ncase) clearly entitle this to be considered as the most interesting\r\nAmerican locality of this beautiful mineral. Measures have been\r\ntaken to investigate the subject more fully, and to obtain a supply\r\nof specimens.\r\n\r\nQuartz crystals appear to abound at the same place, besides various\r\nother minerals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. IV. _Carbonate of Magnesia, and very uncommon Amianthus,\r\ndiscovered near New-York.--Extract of a Letter from Mr. James\r\nPierce to the Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _New-York, May 18, 1818._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI forward you specimens of straw and rose-coloured amianthus I\r\nrecently met with on Staten-Island, which I detached, in strips,\r\nfrom a rock; it not appearing, as is usual, in veins. It breaks up\r\nlike flax, and may be spun and wove without the aid of moisture;\r\nand in respect to tenacity, flexibility, and length of fibre, it\r\nmay be considered the best found in this country, and perhaps equal\r\nto any hitherto discovered. Staten-Island exhibits many minerals\r\nworthy of examination. I subjoin, as requested, the following\r\ngeological description, &c.\r\n\r\nHoboken, where I discovered native carbonate of magnesia, is\r\nsituated opposite the city of New-York, on the western or\r\nNew-Jersey bank of the Hudson. It is a primitive, insulated\r\nelevation, with a nucleus of serpentine; the ground gradually\r\ndescends in every direction except on the river side, where mural\r\nprecipices of serpentine rock are observed, extending about 100\r\nrods parallel with the water, and elevated from 60 to 100 feet\r\nabove its level. The carbonate of magnesia I found in horizontal\r\nveins of nearly two inches in breadth, and of unknown depth, in a\r\nmidway region of this serpentine ledge; I extracted a considerable\r\nquantity with a spoon. When first taken out it was soft, white, and\r\nvery slightly adhesive, from a little moisture; but, when dry, fell\r\nto powder without friction. The nature of the mineral I immediately\r\nconjectured, and treated it with diluted sulphuric acid, in which\r\nit entirely dissolved with effervescence, forming a bitter fluid,\r\nand leaving no sediment. Upon evaporation, well-defined crystals of\r\nEpsom salts were formed. It differs little from the manufactured\r\ncarbonate of magnesia of the shops; but is rather a super than\r\na sub-carbonate. It has been analyzed by Professor Mitchill,\r\nwho found it exclusively composed of magnesia and carbonic acid.\r\nCarbonates of magnesia, hitherto discovered, have been, I believe,\r\nfound impure, and in a state of rock, requiring chemical process to\r\nrender them serviceable; this is, perhaps, fit for immediate use.\r\nWhen I first mentioned the discovery to mineralogists, they were\r\nincredulous, supposing it did not natively exist in this state, but\r\nI convinced them by uniting it with sulphuric acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nThe specimen of amianthus, referred to in Mr. Pierce's\r\ncommunication, is uncommon. The fibres measure from 12 to 15 inches\r\nin length, and are as soft and flexible as fine human hair.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered, that in the rocks at Hoboken, Dr. Bruce\r\ndiscovered the hydrate of magnesia, or magnesia combined with\r\nnothing but water, in the proportion of about 70 per cent. of\r\nmagnesia. This discovery gave a new and interesting species to\r\nmineralogy; it is now admitted in the systematical works on\r\nmineralogy.\r\n\r\nMr. Pierce's discovery is not less interesting; and we presume he\r\nwill be deemed correct in the opinion, that pure native carbonate\r\nof magnesia has not been discovered before. The serpentine of\r\nHoboken, then, is memorable for affording these two new species.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. V. _Native Copper._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Bruce's Journal, (Vol. I. p. 149.) mention is made of a\r\nremarkable piece of native copper, found near New-Haven many years\r\nago, and weighing about 90lbs.\r\n\r\nWe have now to add, (and the fact is, indeed, mentioned in\r\nCleaveland's Mineralogy,) that another piece has been recently\r\nfound half a mile west of the Hartford turnpike road, opposite the\r\ntown of Wallingford, and twelve miles from New-Haven. It was turned\r\nup in ploughing to repair a road. The country is of the secondary\r\ntrap formation, and the rocks, at the particular place, are the\r\nold red sandstone of Werner, which here occupies the plains, and\r\nruns under the trap. The piece weighs almost six pounds; it is\r\nfine virgin copper, with rudiments of large octahedral crystals of\r\nnative copper upon its surface, which is more or less incrusted\r\nwith green carbonate of copper and ruby oxid, very much resembling\r\nthat of Cornwall: the ruby oxid is particularly remarkable in the\r\ncavities of the piece.\r\n\r\nAs it was found within three or four miles of the place where the\r\nlarge piece of ninety pounds weight was discovered, and as copper\r\nis known to exist in many places in these hills, the facts should\r\nbe kept in view, and may lead to something of importance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. VI. _Petrified Wood from Antigua._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mineralogy and geology of the West-India islands has been,\r\nas yet, but little explored. The scientific world has, however,\r\nbeen favoured with some interesting articles from the pen of Dr.\r\nNugent; and we are informed that he has described also the geology\r\nof the island of Antigua. We have recently become acquainted with\r\none interesting production of this island, and without waiting for\r\nDr. Nugent's account, (which we believe has not yet reached this\r\ncountry) we shall lay it before our readers.\r\n\r\nWe are under obligations to Mr. Pelatiah Perit, of New-York, for\r\na collection of specimens of silicious petrifactions of wood from\r\nAntigua. Their characters are indubitable; the distinct ligneous\r\nlayers corresponding with the annual growth, the medullary\r\nprolongations, the knots formed by branches, the cracks and the\r\nbark, are all distinctly visible. Some of the pieces are ponderous\r\nportions of large trees.\r\n\r\nAs to the mineralizing matter, it is evidently silicious, and the\r\nspecimens are principally the holzstein of Werner; crystals of\r\nquartz are apparent in the cavities; some parts are agatized, and\r\nveins of chalcedony occasionally pervade the fissures: they are\r\nnot impressible by steel, and give fire with it. According to the\r\ninformation of Mr. Perit, they are scattered over the surface of\r\nthe Island of Antigua, with a profusion hardly less than that which\r\nHorneman observed of the same mineral during his travels over the\r\neastern part of the great African desert.\r\n\r\nIt is much to be wished that our numerous intelligent navigators\r\nand travelling merchants would, in imitation of this and of a\r\nsimilar example, mentioned below, bestow some share of their\r\nattention on the natural productions of the countries which they\r\nvisit. In this way they might, on their return, render very\r\nessential services to the science of their own country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. VII. _Porcelain and Porcelain Clays._\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the kind offices of a friend, we have been furnished,\r\nfrom one of the great porcelain manufactories in the vicinity of\r\nParis, with a series of specimens, to illustrate the elegant art of\r\nfabricating porcelain. The specimens begin with the raw materials,\r\nand exhibit them in all their principal stages of advancement up\r\nto the perfect vessel, including the materials for the glazing,\r\nand the colours for the painting, and the application of both.\r\nAt the request of the manufacturer, through whose liberality we\r\nwere indulged with this gratification, we transmitted to Paris\r\nvarious specimens of American porcelain clays. This gentleman has\r\ncaused them to be subjected to trials in the porcelain furnaces,\r\nand he finds that some of them are equal to the French porcelain\r\nclays, and some superior. As our specimens were all labelled with\r\nthe names of the places, in this country, from which they were\r\nobtained, we hope soon to learn where to look for porcelain clays,\r\nequal or superior to those celebrated ones from which the superb\r\nFrench porcelain is manufactured.\r\n\r\nAs this subject is one of much practical importance to the rising\r\narts of this country, and as much interest has been excited in\r\nParis concerning our porcelain clays, we should feel greatly\r\nobliged by the transmission to us of any specimens of American\r\nporcelain clays, with memoranda of the place, the quantity,\r\nthe depth at which obtained, the difficulty of obtaining, and,\r\ngenerally, all the peculiar circumstances. We will take care that\r\ntheir value shall be ascertained, if they appear promising, and a\r\nproper return shall be made to the proprietor.\r\n\r\nTo those of our readers who may not be familiar with this subject,\r\nwe would however take the liberty to remark, that porcelain clays\r\ngenerally arise from the decomposition of granite, and particularly\r\nof that kind which is denominated graphic granite, and which\r\nabounds with feldspar. It is, therefore, in the primitive countries\r\nthat we are chiefly to expect them--such as New-England, and part\r\nof the high country of the middle and southern states.\r\n\r\nIt should be observed, that if a clay, otherwise apparently good,\r\nburns red, it contains iron, and is unfit for porcelain; although\r\nit may serve well enough for more common and coarse earthen ware.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. VIII. _Native Sulphur from Java._\r\n\r\n\r\nThrough the kindness of Mr. I. Huntington, recently returned from\r\nJava, we have received from that Island some fine specimens of\r\nnative sulphur. They are very pure, of an orange yellow, slightly\r\nshaded with white, and occasionally with red; some of the cavities\r\nare lined with delicate crystals. What gives them particular\r\ninterest is, that they are believed to be from that \"large, and\r\nnow nearly extinct, volcano, about sixty miles from the town\r\nof Batavia, at the bottom of which (of the crater) lie large\r\nquantities of native sulphur, even many hundred tons.\" It is in\r\nthe crater of this volcano that the famous lake of sulphuric acid\r\nexists, and from which it flows down the mountain, and through the\r\ncountry below, a river of the same acid. (See Tilloch's Phil.\r\nMag. Vol. XLII. p. 182.) It is a most curious phenomenon, and we\r\nbelieve entirely without a parallel. Another river, called the\r\nWhite River, unites with this some miles below its origin: this\r\nriver, which is so called from the turbidness of its waters, its\r\nsalutary to men and animals; fishes live in it, and vegetation is\r\nnourished by its waters; but after the junction it becomes clear;\r\nthe acid dissolving the earthy particles which discoloured it, and\r\nit now becomes fatal to living beings: kills the fish, destroys the\r\nvegetation, and corrodes the stones in its channel. This remarkable\r\nriver flows from Mount Idienne, in the province of Bagnia Vangni,\r\nin the eastern part of Java.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. IX. _Productions of Wier's Cave, in Virginia._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to the Reverend Elias Cornelius, and to Mr. John H.\r\nKain, for a collection of the calcareous incrustations of Wier's\r\nCave, in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe stalactites, and stalagmites, and various incrustations, are of\r\nuncommon size and beauty. Some of the stalactites have a delicate\r\nwhiteness, and a brilliancy arising from their crystallized\r\nstructure, which, with the regularity of their forms, give them a\r\nfair title to rank with those of the famous caverns in the Peak of\r\nDerbyshire, in the island of Antiparos, &c.\r\n\r\nIn these stalactites, the structure is most remarkably distinct,\r\nboth in the fibrous and concentric lamellar form. In this\r\ncollection were observed many forms of the crystallized hard\r\ncarbonates of lime, of Count Bournon.\r\n\r\nFor a description of the cavern from which these specimens came, we\r\nrefer to the succeeding memoir, by Mr. Kain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. X. _Remarks on the Mineralogy and Geology of the Northwestern\r\npart of the State of Virginia, and the Eastern part of the State of\r\nTennessee._ By Mr. JOHN H. KAIN, of Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most prominent as well as the most beautiful feature of this\r\ncountry, is that succession of mountain and valley, ridge and vale,\r\nwhich we meet with in traversing its surface. The grand range of\r\nAlleghany mountains enters Virginia about the 39th degree of north\r\nlatitude; and, pursuing a southwestern course, spreads out upon the\r\neast end of Tennessee, and terminates near the southern boundary\r\nline of that state, in the Alabama territory; and about the 34th\r\nparallel of north latitude. In this view are included the Blue\r\nMountains, the North Mountains, the Allegheny, (properly so called)\r\nthe Cumberland, Clinch, Iron, and Smoky mountains, together with\r\na variety of smaller mountains, spurs, and ridges, all running\r\nparallel to each other, from the northeast to the southwest; and\r\nall, I believe I may say, covered with forests, and presenting to\r\nthe eye of the naturalist a most interesting field for speculation\r\nand improvement.\r\n\r\nWith a few exceptions, the geologist meets with none of those\r\nremarkable appearances which indicate the changes and convulsions\r\nwhich have been wrought by time, the great enemy of nature.\r\nOccasionally we are presented with a view of a sublime precipice,\r\nformed by a section which a river appears to have made for itself\r\nthrough an opposing mountain; and the large masses of ruins, which\r\nlie scattered around such a place, seem, to the imagination of the\r\nsolitary traveller, the historical records of commotions, awful\r\neven in retrospect. Most commonly, however, the mountains seem to\r\nhave lain for ages in undisturbed repose; and the streams of water,\r\nwhen they have crossed them, have sought an easy passage through\r\nthe ravines, which do not so often divide a mountain, or ridge, at\r\nright angles, as wind between the ends of two opposing spurs, which\r\npass each other, gradually declining into the champaign country at\r\ntheir mutual base. Through this whole extent of country we rarely\r\nmeet with any remarkable falls of water; the obvious reason of\r\nwhich is, that the rocks are so soft that they are easily worn down\r\nto the level of the beds of rivers. But shoals, or shallows, are\r\nfrequent, and are formed by beds of rounded sandstone, spread out\r\ninto a broad base, over which the water often rushes with no small\r\nviolence and noise.\r\n\r\nThe mountains are generally, though not always, sterile, and\r\nproduce nothing but forest trees; but the valleys are, with hardly\r\nan exception, rich, and productive of every variety of \"grass and\r\nherb yielding seed, and fruit-tree yielding fruit.\" Nor are they\r\nless favoured in the mineral kingdom; possessing the greatest\r\nabundance of all the most useful and necessary minerals, of which\r\nwe shall now proceed to speak in order.\r\n\r\nAll the country included under the boundaries mentioned above,\r\nwith the exception of some primitive ranges of mountains on the\r\nsoutheastern side, is apparently _transition_. This, it will be\r\nseen by a reference to Mr. Maclure's excellent map, will extend the\r\nboundary of his transition class considerably farther northwest,\r\nand make it include Cumberland Mountain and all East Tennessee.\r\nThis would be evident from comparing the northwestern part of\r\nVirginia, which Mr. Maclure has included in his transition tract\r\nwith all East Tennessee. Every mineralogist must observe the\r\nidentity of the minerals of the two countries as well as that of\r\ntheir stratification and general formation. The limestone in the\r\nvalleys, and the sandstone on the mountains, lie in strata which\r\nmake an angle of from 25 to 45 degrees with the horizon. The\r\nlimestone bears the impressions of shells, but rarely, if ever, of\r\nvegetables, and contains beds of hornstone, but not of flint, or\r\nwhat can properly be called flint.\r\n\r\nThe rock which lies in the lowest valleys, and often rises into\r\npretty high hills, and is seen forming bluffs on the banks of the\r\nrivers, is _limestone_: it is of a dark blue, approaching to a\r\ngray, as it is exposed to the air, and often appearing quite white.\r\nIts fracture is compact in one direction; in another it is more\r\nor less slaty in its structure. It is interspersed with veins of\r\nthe crystallized carbonate of lime, more or less perfect, and of a\r\npure but opaque white. Another variety of this limestone, not so\r\nabundant, is that which is white and red, having the white and red\r\nspots intimately mingled. Its structure is similar to the other\r\nkind.\r\n\r\nLying in beds of this limestone, parallel to, and imbedded in, its\r\nstrata, is a stone, which, from its globular form, its hardness,\r\nand its colour, has been usually mistaken for flint. On comparing\r\nit with the flint of chalk-beds, we find it much less translucent,\r\nits colour darker, and its hues duller; and its rough and irregular\r\nfracture, compared with the easy, smooth, and conchoidal cleavage\r\nof the true flint, decides it to be hornstone. It is found also\r\nforming considerable distinct beds on the hills; and is seen in\r\ndetached pieces, and irregular pebbles, covering many of the ridges.\r\n\r\nAlternating with the beds of limestone, and possessing the same\r\nformation, is a soft _clay slate_. _Soapstone_ is found in it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we ascend the mountains, we meet with a slaty sand-stone\r\nof various compactness, as it possesses more or less iron, often\r\nforming an excellent iron ore. A variety of this iron ore has been\r\nlately turned to a good use, in the manufacture of a red paint,\r\nnear Knoxville, Tennessee. Different varieties of this sandstone\r\npossess different qualities. It is converted by the inhabitants\r\ninto millstones, grindstones, and whetstones. Interspersed among\r\nthe sandstone of the mountains we often find very beautiful and\r\ninteresting specimens of hornstones, assuming a resemblance to all\r\nthe silicious stones, from the chalcedony to the jasper. In this\r\nextensive range of mountains, many other minerals exist, of which\r\nwe shall treat more particularly hereafter. The limestone, slate,\r\nand sandstone, as far as the writer's knowledge extends, so to\r\nspeak, _form the country_; the limestone and clay slate dipping\r\nunder the sandstone. Gypsum, coal, sulphate of barytes, &c. are\r\nfound in these, and we shall now speak of their localities.\r\n\r\n_Gypsum._--This valuable mineral production exists in Washington\r\nCounty, Virginia, 20 miles north of Abingdon, in the vicinity of\r\nSaltville. It is similar, in every respect, to the plaster of Nova\r\nScotia, and devoted by the farmers of that part of Virginia, and\r\nTennessee, to similar purposes.\r\n\r\n_Coal_ is said to exist in immense quantities in the Cumberland\r\nMountain. A bed of it is wrought near Knoxville, Tennessee. It is\r\nof an excellent quality; but wood is so abundant that it is used\r\nonly in forges.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Barytes._--This mineral is found in Bottetourt County,\r\nVirginia, near Fincastle; and in Sevier County, Tennessee.\r\n\r\n_Hard Carbonates of Lime._--Stalactitical concretions abound in\r\nall the caves so often described as existing in this country.\r\nThose of Virginia are more perfectly crystallized than those of\r\nTennessee. Under the head of _hard carbonates_ should be mentioned\r\nan extensive bed or vein in Montgomery County in the State of\r\nVirginia, near the seat of Colonel Hancock. It appears to have\r\nbeen formed in a chasm, in the common limestone of the country,\r\nby a calcareous deposition which resembles, exactly, in all its\r\ncharacters, the calcareous concretions which are found forming in\r\nthe caves of the country. The whole bed may, in fact, be regarded\r\nas a cave which has been filled up in the progress of time, by this\r\ncurious process. Its width is various, from two feet to ten, or\r\nmore, extending along the side of a very steep ridge, for at least\r\n50 yards, and it is said to be continued seven miles farther.\r\n\r\n_The silicious carbonate of lime_ may be worth distinguishing from\r\nthe common limestone. It is found in a bed near Colonel Hancock's,\r\nand was supposed to be gypsum. It phosphoresces beautifully; it is\r\nwhite, and confusedly crystalline in its structure, and much harder\r\nthan the common limestone. Indeed the limestone generally, on the\r\neast of the Alleghany, is somewhat harder than that on the west.\r\n\r\n_Lead._--There are several localities of this mineral. A mine of it\r\nis wrought near New River, 15 miles from Wythe, Virginia. Another\r\nlocality of the ore of lead is said to have been discovered in\r\nGranger County, Tennessee, on land belonging to General Cocke.\r\nIt exists also, very near the surface, on the plantation of the\r\nRev. Mr. Craighead, near Nashville; which, however, is out of our\r\nboundary.\r\n\r\nOther metallic ores are said to have been found among these\r\nmountains, and particularly those of gold and silver; but the\r\naccounts are vague and uncertain, and not to be credited.\r\n\r\nThe numerous _Caves_ of this country present attractions to every,\r\nthe least curious, traveller; and, in an eminent degree, to the\r\nmineralogist. They are crevices, or large chasms, probably worn\r\nin the rocks by the passage of water. This will, at first view,\r\nperhaps appear a bold assertion; but if it be recollected that they\r\noccur only in limestone, which is a soft rock, and (under certain\r\ncircumstances,) soluble in water; that the rocks bear every mark\r\nof having been worn by water; and that streams of water are always\r\nfound in them, it will not appear an improbable hypothesis. It is\r\nby no means difficult to believe that a stream, after having worn\r\nsuch a chasm as a cave presents, in the solid rock, may have found\r\nanother channel; and, forsaking the old, have left room for nature\r\nto display some of her most beautiful works. A description of one\r\nof these caves will be a description of all; and we shall select\r\n_Wier's Cave_, in Rockingham County, Virginia, as it is the most\r\ncurious of any with which we are acquainted.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the cave is narrow and difficult. When the cave was\r\nfirst discovered, the passage into it was impeded by stalactites,\r\nwhich had formed perpendicular columns across it; but these are now\r\nremoved. As we advance, our course is at first horizontal, but we\r\nsoon descend fifteen or twenty feet by a ladder, and find ourselves\r\nin a large echoing cavern. Stalactites of a silvery whiteness\r\nare suspended from above, and pillars of stalagmites are rising\r\naround us. Ledges of rocks form our floor, and the uneven walls\r\nare incrusted over with a beautiful brown spar, which is sometimes\r\nsuspended from the canopy in thin, shining, and translucent sheets.\r\nIn passing on over the rugged rock of our pathway, our attention\r\nis divided between a care for our safety, and an admiration of the\r\nsurrounding wonders.\r\n\r\nProceeding on through a narrower crevice in the rocks, we are soon\r\nintroduced into other apartments, differing in shape and size\r\nfrom the first, but resembling it in the irregularity of its\r\nwalls, floor, and covering, and in the calcareous incrustations\r\nand concretions, which, assuming a thousand fantastic shapes, and\r\ndisplaying a sparkling lustre, the more vivid as the light is\r\nstronger, give to this whole grotto the power of charming every\r\nbeholder.\r\n\r\nThe cave is a mile and a half in extent, and extremely irregular in\r\nits course and shape. Its perpendicular height varies from three\r\nto forty feet, and its breadth from two to thirty. Its dividing\r\nbranches are numerous, forming a great variety of apartments. The\r\nblue limestone appears frequently enough to satisfy us that it is\r\nthe groundwork of the whole; but it is almost every where covered\r\nwith incrustations of the hard carbonates. These hang from the\r\narched vault above in clusters, and often reach the ground, forming\r\nmassive columns. Stalagmites again rise from the floor like so\r\nmany statues; the irregular sides of the ledges of rocks are often\r\nincrusted over with white crystals of the carbonate of lime, and\r\nhave the appearance of banks of salt: at times we seem to walk on\r\ndiamond pavements; again our footway is of rounded pebbles, and\r\nseems the bed of a river which had deserted its channel. Often we\r\npass small streams of water; and the water is continually dripping\r\nfrom the ends of the stalactites, the echoing sound of which, when\r\nit drops, forms the only interruption to the profound silence which\r\nreigns throughout the cavern.\r\n\r\nTo give an idea of the diversified shapes which these concretions\r\nassume in the progress of their formation, (and they are constantly\r\nforming,) would be impossible. Suffice it to say, that there is\r\nscarcely any thing on earth to which they may not be supposed to\r\nform a resemblance; and yet, in fact, they are unlike any thing but\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIt is generally known that the earth in these caves contains the\r\nnitrates of lime, and potash, and other salts. The numerous caves\r\nwhich have been found in the Cumberland mountains and other parts\r\nof Tennessee, have been very productive of the nitrate of potash.\r\nIn the investigation of the causes which have given origin to these\r\nsalts, it may be recollected, that wild animals burrow in these\r\ncaves; that when pursued by the hunter, they make them the places\r\nof their retreat, and probably die there; that the aborigines have\r\nmade them a place of burial; and that the streams of water which\r\nflow through them in wet weather, carry with them not only great\r\nquantities of leaves but many other vegetable productions.\r\n\r\nThe _natural bridge_ is celebrated as one of the greatest\r\ncuriosities of the world. Viewed by a geologist, it would probably\r\nbe considered as a cave (so to speak) _unroofed_ in all but one\r\nplace. It seems improbable that if the ravine had been made by a\r\nconvulsion, which had split and separated the rock to the distance\r\nof fifty or sixty feet, any part of it, and particularly so large\r\na mass as that which forms the bridge, should have been left,\r\nwithout exhibiting any marks of violence. The rock is limestone.\r\nIt is known that this rock wears away rapidly under the attrition\r\nof water; and the supposition does not appear improbable, that, in\r\nthe lapse of ages, so large a creek as that which flows below the\r\nbridge, may have worn as deep a ravine as that which now strikes\r\nus with so much surprise, In short, may not a cave have been\r\noriginally formed where the ravine is now, and the pending portion\r\nof it have fallen in at every place except that which now forms\r\nthis celebrated natural curiosity?\r\n\r\n_Mineral Springs._--The mineral springs of this region are numerous\r\nand diversified. Chalybeate springs are promiscuously scattered\r\nover the whole of it; and springs impregnated with sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen are quite common. Salt springs and licks are found more\r\nin the western than the eastern range of mountains. That which was\r\nfirst wrought by William King, is well known. The salt here is\r\nassociated with gypsum. In the same range of mountains, farther to\r\nthe southwest, there are now several other salt-works, and also\r\none to the west, on Goose Creek, in Kentucky, which has been very\r\nproductive.\r\n\r\n_The Warm Springs._--These springs are situated in a country\r\nwhich presents many attractions to the travelling geologist; and\r\nmuch light, it is hoped, will yet be thrown on the geology of our\r\ncountry, by a more minute and accurate examination of it than has\r\nyet been made.\r\n\r\nThe warm springs ooze through the sand on the south bank of the\r\nFrench Broad river, in the mountains which divide the state\r\nof Tennessee from her parent state, about the 36th parallel of\r\nlatitude. The temperature of the water is about 95° of Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nOn the opposite side of the river from the springs is a geological\r\ncuriosity. A limestone rock is seen dipping under the sandstone\r\nwhich forms the country. Limestone is nowhere else to be seen\r\nwithin six miles of this place. In this limestone rock is a cave\r\nsimilar to others already described.\r\n\r\n_Paint Rock_, in the vicinity of the Warm Springs, is interesting\r\non many accounts. It is a bold precipice on the bank of French\r\nBroad river. At this place the river passes with a very rapid\r\ncurrent directly across the course of a mountain, which terminates\r\nabruptly, and forms the precipice on the north bank of the river.\r\nOn looking at the rock, the opposite end of the mountain, and\r\nthe ruins around it, the mind is insensibly carried back to the\r\ncontemplation of some dreadful commotion in nature, which probably\r\nshook these mountains to their bases.\r\n\r\nThe rock is composed of a _clay slate_; and it is here again\r\nremarkable, that this stone is not to be seen in any other\r\nplace within some miles. It has received its name from some red\r\npaintings, (probably left on it by the Indians,) which have the\r\nappearance of hieroglyphics.\r\n\r\nTo conclude. It will be seen from the above observations, that this\r\ncountry presents a vast field of most interesting research, and\r\nclaims the attention of every traveller who is interested at all in\r\ngeological inquiries. If what has been said will at all contribute\r\nto the enlargement of the general stock of our knowledge on these\r\nsubjects, the writer will be much gratified; and it is his sincere\r\nwish, that the accuracy of his remarks may be tried, and his\r\nmistakes corrected, by the researches of succeeding travellers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XI. _Notice of Professor Mitchill's Edition of Cuvier's Essay\r\non the Theory of the Earth._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American scientific public are under obligations to Professor\r\nMitchill for bringing this book within their reach. It is one of\r\nthe most eloquent, impressive, and instructive works on this grand\r\nbut obscure subject, with which the world has ever been favoured.\r\nThe reader is no sooner drawn within the current of Cuvier's\r\neloquence, than he is borne along almost without the power or wish\r\nto escape. It is believed there are few intelligent and enlightened\r\npersons, whether geologists or not, who would fail to be gratified\r\nby a book which secures the understanding by a strict course of\r\nreasoning from facts, and delights the taste by a style bold,\r\nterse, and lucid, but at the same time rich and flowing.\r\n\r\nThe analysis of this work has been ably performed in Europe, and\r\nthere is, therefore, the less necessity to attempt it here. While\r\nwe take the liberty thus to recommend it, we do not hold ourselves\r\nstrictly bound to the admission of _every one_ of Cuvier's\r\ndoctrines; and might, perhaps, wish that in a few instances he had\r\nbeen somewhat more explicit, or somewhat more qualified.\r\n\r\nThe additions by Professor Jameson, of Edinburgh, are valuable and\r\ninteresting, and are retained in the present edition.\r\n\r\nThose by Professor Mitchill will be perused with pleasure and\r\nadvantage. The learned author has assembled, in one view, a\r\ngreat mass of facts, partly resulting from his own journeys and\r\nobservations, and partly deduced from other respectable sources.\r\nWe have no doubt that most of these facts will be considered by\r\nthe scientific world as very interesting, whatever views they\r\nmay entertain of the conclusions built upon them. The author has\r\noccupied himself principally upon those portions of the United\r\nStates, which, by the organized remains both of animals and\r\nvegetables, with which they more or less abound, exhibit the most\r\ndecisive and interesting evidence of changes and catastrophes,\r\nwhose history is to be sought in the memorials entombed in the\r\nstrata themselves.\r\n\r\nWe give no opinion regarding the theories of Professor Mitchill,\r\nnot intending to review the work, but merely to aid, as far as\r\nin our power, in drawing the public attention to the interesting\r\nsubjects about which it is occupied.\r\n\r\nIf we have any remark to add, it is, that an adherence to the\r\ntechnical precision with which most rocks are at the present day\r\ndescribed, appears desirable in mineralogical and geological\r\ndescriptions. When in the valuable additions before us we read\r\nof schorl rock, we gain only the idea of a rock containing that\r\nmineral; but as it occurs occasionally in several of the primitive\r\nrocks, we are at a loss which is intended; we believe it never\r\nforms a rock by itself. So with the slate rocks: there are several\r\nvarieties of them--mica slate, clay slate, greenstone slate, &c.\r\nbesides some subdivisions; and the mere word slate does not always\r\ngive us the precise idea. But we are aware that, in the present\r\ncase, it was less in view to go into all the details of geological\r\ndescription, than to give a view of our organized remains and of\r\ntheir supposed origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XII. _Notice of Eaton's Index to the Geology of the Northern\r\nStates, together with a Transverse Section of the Catskill Mountain\r\nto the Atlantic._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extensive collection of facts in this little book of fifty-four\r\npages, is creditable to the author's industry and discernment:\r\nhe informs us that he has travelled 1000 miles on foot, while\r\ninvestigating the geology of the district concerning which he\r\nhas written. This district is certainly interesting, and every\r\nattempt to diffuse correct information concerning it, deserves\r\nencouragement. Mr. Eaton's account of the regions he has explored,\r\nhas every mark of verisimilitude; and we commend his efforts to\r\ndiffuse geological information, by short courses of lectures, in\r\ndifferent towns. In his arrangement of rocks, he has deviated from\r\nWerner--has adopted some views of Bakewell, and some of his own.\r\nWerner's arrangement of rocks has, undoubtedly, its imperfections\r\nand its redundancies; and yet it may be questioned how far his\r\nsystem has been really improved by its different emendators. If\r\nWerner, by mentioning argillaceous schistus only in the primitive\r\nclass of rocks, left us to dispose of it where we might, when\r\nwe find it at one time, covering or sustaining anthracite, with\r\nimpressions of ferns, and at another with impressions of fish and\r\nvegetables, and in contact with bituminous coal; still those who,\r\nwith Mr. Eaton, throw argillaceous slate into the transition class,\r\nand omit it in the primitive and secondary, embarrass us with\r\nan equal difficulty; for we find argillaceous slate in contact,\r\nand alternating with, mica slate, and without any impressions of\r\norganized bodies, when we must, without a doubt, call it primitive.\r\n\r\nThis is the fact with the clay slate of the Woodbridge hills,\r\nnear New-Haven, which is primitive; that of Rhode-Island, with\r\nanthracite, is transition; and that at Middlefields, west of\r\nMiddletown, with impressions of fish, is secondary. Slate then\r\nappears to belong to all these three great classes of rocks.\r\n\r\nAs to the _metalliferous_ limestone, we do not so much object to\r\nthe introduction of this term by Bakewell, although it appears\r\nto us quite as well to say that certain limestones, those of the\r\ntransition class for example, are metalliferous. But is Eaton\r\ncorrect in referring such limestone as that of which the New-York\r\nCity-Hall is built, to a metalliferous class? Is not that limestone\r\ndecidedly primitive? The fact mentioned of its containing pyrites,\r\nhardly proves it to be metalliferous; since most rocks contain more\r\nor less of pyrites. Some other remarks of less importance we might\r\nadd, but we prefer concluding by recommending this tract to the\r\nperusal of those who wish for information respecting the geological\r\nstructure of New-England; and we think that Mr. Eaton is seriously\r\naiding the progress of geology in the interior of New-England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XIII. _Notice of M. Brongniart on Organized Remains._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis distinguished mineralogist, so advantageously known by his\r\nexcellent work on mineralogy--his researches in company with\r\nCuvier, into the subterranean geography of the environs of Paris,\r\nand his superintendence of the great porcelain manufactory at\r\nSevres, is attempting to form an extensive collection of organized\r\nremains.\r\n\r\nThrough Professor Cleaveland, we have received from him the\r\nfollowing\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTICE\r\n\r\n_Concerning the method of collecting, labelling, and transmitting\r\nspecimens of fossil organized bodies, and of the accompanying\r\nrocks, solicited by_ M. BRONGNIART.\r\n\r\nThe study of fossil organized bodies appears to be of the utmost\r\nimportance in determining the relations of different formations,\r\none of the principal objects of geology.\r\n\r\nIn order more effectually to appreciate the value of this method\r\nof investigation, it is necessary to multiply observations--to\r\nendeavour to render them exact and precise--and especially to make\r\nthem upon a general plan.\r\n\r\nM. Brongniart has been long occupied in such researches. The essay\r\npublished by M. Cuvier and him, upon the geology of the environs of\r\nParis, has afforded an example of their use.\r\n\r\nHe has laboured since this period to apply this method to other\r\nformations, which contain the relics of organized bodies; but he\r\nstands in need of much assistance, and he presumes to ask it, not\r\nonly of naturalists, but even of all persons interested in the\r\nsciences. By means of the following instructions, he endeavours to\r\navail himself of the kindness of persons the least conversant in\r\nthe discrimination of fossils.\r\n\r\n1. To collect all the fossil organized bodies which can be\r\nobtained; especially _the distinguishable impressions and remains\r\nof vegetables_ from coal countries, and beds of wood, coal, and\r\nothers. The _shells_, _crustaceæ_, _madrepores_, _fishes_, &c.\r\nIt is not necessary that these bodies should be either large or\r\nentire, but they must be sufficiently characterized to be capable\r\nof being recognized.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to transmit large unmeaning pieces, which are\r\nrecommended only by their size--such as large ammonites--large\r\nmadrepores--large pieces of petrified wood--fragments of the one,\r\nor small individuals of the other, are often sufficient. We may\r\navoid also collecting the inner moulds (\"des moules interieurs\")\r\nof shells, because they are almost invariably incapable of being\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\n2. Petrifactions, isolated and detached from their rock, are the\r\nmost convenient in the determination of species; but when they\r\ncannot be separated from the rock, we need not hesitate to send\r\nthem engaged; it is sufficient if a portion large enough for\r\ndiscrimination is visible.\r\n\r\nAmong shells, those are preferable which have the mouth or hinge\r\nin view; among madrepores, those on whose surface the figures (les\r\nétoiles) are distinguishable; among vegetables, those whose leaves\r\nare distinctly expanded, (expalmées.)\r\n\r\n3. Upon the objects transmitted it is desirable to have, at least\r\nin part, the following notices:\r\n\r\n1. The exact place from which the object comes: this is the most\r\nimportant circumstance, and the easiest to obtain.\r\n\r\n2. The kind of formation in which it is found, and a specimen of\r\nthe stratum, or at least of the rock, which contained it. It is\r\ndesirable that this rock exhibit remains of petrifactions similar\r\nto those found in the stratum from which it has been drawn.\r\n\r\n3. The nature of the formation of which this stratum or rock\r\ncomposes a part, and specimens of as many of the superior and\r\ninferior strata as can be obtained, designating the order of\r\nsuperposition of the strata.\r\n\r\n4. It is important to designate, by the same mark, all the\r\npetrifactions _unquestionably_ found in the same stratum, or at\r\nleast in the same formation. The specimens ought to be almost\r\nsquare--about three inches or more on a side, and one and a half\r\nthick.\r\n\r\n5. It is equally important not to mix petrifactions found in\r\ndifferent formations, or in different strata of the same formation;\r\nor if they are packed together, to distinguish them by numbers,\r\nmarks, or labels.\r\n\r\nWhen the preceding notices cannot be obtained, the first will\r\nsuffice.\r\n\r\nIn order to collect the petrifactions, and to render them useful,\r\nit is not necessary to know them, nor to be perplexed to find them\r\nout; nor to be afraid of sending objects already known or of little\r\nnote. A part of the preceding indications, connected with the most\r\ncommon petrifactions, will always render them useful. The important\r\npoint then is, not to mix those which are found separate, nor to\r\nseparate those which are found associated in the same stratum.\r\n\r\nThis is easily attained, by designating by a common number, letter,\r\nor any sign whatever, one particular formation or stratum, and\r\nby marking with the same sign all the petrifactions which are\r\nevidently found together.\r\n\r\nThe labels designating the place or the geological situation, may\r\nbe placed in the papers which envelope the specimens, or a number,\r\nreferring to an explanatory catalogue, may be attached to each\r\nspecimen.\r\n\r\nAs far as possible, it is necessary to stick the labels or numbers\r\nto the pieces, by pasting; and the surest way is, to write upon the\r\npiece itself, 1st, the place where it is found; 2d, the number by\r\nwhich it is indicated in the historical notes above requested.\r\n\r\nIf there is not time to make out as many numbers or labels as there\r\nare pieces, it will be sufficient to unite in one box or packet all\r\nthe petrifactions of one particular stratum, and to designate them\r\nby a general label.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to pack the shells and other fragile pieces in\r\nseparate boxes, and to wrap each piece in a separate paper.\r\n\r\nM. Brongniart cannot allow himself to prefer such requests, except\r\nunder the express condition, that a memorandum of all the expenses\r\nwhich the transportation and packing of the specimens may create\r\nshall accompany the letter of advice.\r\n\r\nThe objects destined for him may be sent by the common modes of\r\nconveyance, with a letter of advice, to the following address:\r\n\r\nMr. A. BRONGNIART, Member of the Royal Academy of Sciences,\r\nEngineer of Mines, etc. Rue Saint-Dominique, Faubourg\r\nSaint-Germain, No. 71, Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XIV. _Observations on a species of Limosella, recently\r\ndiscovered in the United States, by Dr. Eli Ives, Professor of\r\nMateria Medica and Botany, in the Medical Institution of Yale\r\nCollege._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis small plant was observed in flower in July, 1816, by Mr.\r\nHoratio N. Fenn (now of Rochester, State of New-York) in company\r\nwith Dr. Leavenworth. The plant and the seeds have been preserved\r\nby me, in a flower-pot, from that time to the present. The plant\r\nwas taken a few rods south of Mr. Whitney's gun manufactory, on the\r\nmargin of the river, where it was covered by every tide. I have\r\nsince observed the plant in great abundance on the margin of the\r\nHousatonuck, in Derby, and in those small streams in East Haven,\r\nBranford, and Guilford, which empty into Long-Island Sound.\r\n\r\nA specimen of the limosella (with some specimens of the tillea)\r\nwas sent to Z. Collins, Esq. of Philadelphia, who wrote me that\r\nMr. Nuttall had found the same plant, a few days previous to the\r\nreceipt of my letter, and that they had no question on the subject\r\nof the generic character, but that it would probably prove to be a\r\nnew species.\r\n\r\nIn the transactions of the Medico-Physical Society of New-York,\r\npage 440, it is described under the name of limosella subulata.\r\nA description of the plant was published about the same time, by\r\nMr. Nuttall, in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of\r\nPhiladelphia. (See Vol. I. No. 6. p. 115.)\r\n\r\nIn the paper written by Mr. Nuttall is the following query: \"Does\r\nthis plant, with a lateral mode of growth and alternate leaves,\r\ngerminate with two cotyledons?\" The following observations were\r\nmade in answer to this question. In the winter of 1816-17 this\r\nplant was kept in a situation exposed to severe frost; yet whenever\r\nthe weather became warm for two or three days, it became quite\r\ngreen, but for the last winter there was no appearance of life in\r\nthe plant. In March 1818, the vessel in which the limosella had\r\nbeen preserved for two summers preceding, and in which were a great\r\nquantity of seeds, was exposed in a warm situation to the sun.\r\nThere was no appearance of vegetation until the last of March, when\r\nwere observed several cylindrical leaves, some of them evidently\r\narose from bulbs which had formed the last summer, on account of\r\nthe dryness of its situation, which frequently occurs when plants\r\nare removed from a moist to a dry situation. In other instances\r\nsingle cylindrical leaves arose from the earth, where no bulbs\r\nwere to be found; these cylindrical leaves were thought to arise\r\nfrom seeds, which, if it was a fact, would prove that the plant\r\nvegetated with but one cotyledon. In a short time the vessel was\r\ncrowded with the seeds of the limosella raised by the cotyledons.\r\nThese were carefully observed, and in every instance, when the coat\r\nof the seed was cast off, two linear cotyledons were observed, soon\r\na cylindrical leaf arose from the centre of the cotyledons, and\r\nwhen this leaf had grown to the length of half an inch, a leaf of a\r\nsimilar kind arose laterally to a line made by the first leaf and\r\nthe cotyledons.\r\n\r\nFrom the facts above stated, it is thought to be proved that the\r\nlimosella vegetates with two cotyledons. This was the fact in every\r\ninstance where the husk of the seeds was obviously attached to the\r\ncotyledons, and in the few instances where the plants appeared to\r\nvegetate with but one cotyledon, it is probable that it arose from\r\na bulb or some portion of the old plant, in which life had not been\r\nextinguished, during the past winter, which was made more probable\r\nby the fact that several of the leaves arose obviously from bulbs.\r\nThis limosella,[11] with its congeners, hence will take its place\r\nin the natural order of Jussieu lysimachiæ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART.

It evidently affords an excellent\r\ncriterion of the actual temperature, on a scale more extensive than\r\nit is practicable to obtain from thermometrical registers.\r\n\r\nFloral Calendars kept in various parts of the United States would\r\nafford very interesting information, as to the changes of climate\r\nin particular places; a common topic of popular remarks but\r\ngenerally with few and inaccurate data.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XVI. _A Journal of the Progress of Vegetation near\r\nPhiladelphia between the 20th of February and the 20th of May,\r\n1816, with occasional Zoological Remarks._ By C. S. RAFINESQUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of observations on the annual progress of vegetation\r\nis obvious, and, as connected with agriculture, gardening, &c.,\r\neminently useful. Comparative observations acquire a particular\r\ndegree of interest, when made by skilful observers, at the same\r\ntime, but at different places. Dr. Bigelow, of Boston, issued a\r\ncircular, proposing that such contemporaneous observations should\r\nbe made in the spring of 1817; and I wish that his request may\r\nhave been attended to, when the collection of those observations\r\nmay afford valuable materials for an American Calendar of Flora.\r\nThe blossoming of plants is easily watched, but their foliation\r\nand budding ought not to be neglected. Having been prevented, by\r\nvarious causes, from keeping an exact record of the progress of\r\nvegetation near New-York in 1817, I submit an accurate journal\r\nwhich I had kept the year before, at Philadelphia, in which I hope\r\nthat some interesting facts may be noticed. Dr. Benjamin Barton has\r\npublished a sketch of a Calendar of Flora for Philadelphia, in his\r\nFragments on the Natural History of Pennsylvania; by comparing it\r\nwith mine, many material differences may be traced, which evince\r\na gradual change of temperature, although the spring of 1816 was\r\nremarkably cold and late. The greater quantity of species observed\r\nby me may, besides, render this journal a sort of vernal Flora of\r\nthe neighbourhood of Philadelphia; and many species found by me are\r\nnot to be met in the _Flora Philadelphica_ of Dr. William Barton.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February_ 20. The _Hyacinthus orientalis_ begins to show its\r\nflowers, and on the\r\n\r\n24. In full blossom, as well as _Convallaria majalis_, in rooms.\r\n\r\n25. The grass begins to look greenish in some parts.\r\n\r\n26. Seen the first larva of insect in a pond.\r\n\r\n27. The _Motacilla sialis_, or bluebird, is heard for the first\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n28. The first shad (_Clupea sapidissima_) is taken in the Delaware,\r\nwhile on the same day, the first smelt (_Salmo eperlanoides_) was\r\ntaken in the Raritan, at New-Brunswick.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March_ 1. The _Tulipa gesneriana_, and _Hesperis matronalis_, are\r\nin blossom at the windows: the suckers (_genus Catostomus_) appear\r\nin the fish-market.\r\n\r\n2. The catkins of the _Alnus serrulatus_ begin to swell.\r\n\r\n3. Those of _Salix Caprea_ begin to appear.\r\n\r\n4. The grass looks green by patches in the country.\r\n\r\n5. The leaves of _Veronica officinalis_, _Plantago virginiana_,\r\n_Saxifraga virginica_, &c. are quite unfolded.\r\n\r\n6. The new leaves of _Kalmia latifolia_ begin to appear.\r\n\r\n7. The spathas of _Spathyema fetida_, or _Fothos fetida_, begin to\r\nappear in blossom.\r\n\r\n8. The _Alnus serrulatus_ is in full blossom.\r\n\r\n10. Found several mosses and ferns in blossom; these last were\r\ncovered with capsules or old fructification: they were _Asplenium\r\nebeneum_, _Aspidium marginale_, _Asp. acrostichoides_, _Polypodium\r\nmedium_, N. Sp., &c.\r\n\r\n11. Seen the first spider, in the country, brown, oblong, walking.\r\nA fall of snow at night.\r\n\r\n12.

XVII. _Description of a New Species of North American Marten_,\r\n(_Mustela vulpina_) by C. S. RAFINESQUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe regions watered by the Missouri are inhabited by many animals,\r\nas yet unknown to the zoologists, although many have been noticed\r\nby travellers. A species of marten has lately been presented to\r\nthe Lyceum of Natural History in New-York, which was brought from\r\nthat country, and appears to belong to a peculiar species, very\r\ndifferent from the common martens of Europe, Asia, and America,\r\nalthough it has, in common with it, the character of the yellow\r\nthroat; but the head, feet, and tail, afford so many peculiar\r\ncharacters, that no doubt can be entertained of its diversity. I\r\nhave, therefore, given to it the name of _Mustela vulpina_, or Fox\r\nMarten, owing to its head and tail being somewhat similar to that\r\nof a fox.\r\n\r\n_Mustela Vulpina._ Definition--Brown, three large yellowish spots\r\nunderneath on the throat, breast, and belly; cheeks, inside of\r\nthe ears, and a spot on the nape, white; tail tipped with white\r\none-third of total length; feet blackish, toes white.\r\n\r\n_Description._--This animal is of a fine shape: its size is rather\r\nabove mediocrity, being about half a foot high, and the total\r\nlength being twenty-seven inches, whereof nine form the tail. The\r\ngeneral colour of the fur is of a drab brown, and it is neither\r\ncoarse nor very fine. The head is elongated, oblong, about four\r\ninches long, shaped like that of a fox; the snout is narrow; the\r\nnose is black, notched, and granulated, furnished on each side with\r\nblack whiskers, two inches long: there are three long black hairs,\r\nor _vibrissa_, above each eye, and a few shorter ones scattered\r\nbehind them on the cheeks, chin, and tip of the lower jaw, which\r\nis white: the cheeks are whitish, and there is a white spot on the\r\nnape of the neck: the ears are large, broad, and white inside.\r\nThere are three large, oblong spots, on the throat, breast, and\r\nbelly; this last is the largest; that on the breast the smallest.\r\nThe fore legs are shorter than the hind ones, and have, behind,\r\nthree very long hairs or vibrissa: the feet and toes of all the\r\nlegs are covered with long fur; the former have a dark brown or\r\nblackish ring, and the latter are of a dirty white: there are five\r\nlong toes to all the feet, of which the inner one is the shortest;\r\nthe nails are white, retractible, and shorter than the fur. The\r\nteeth are as in the genus _Mustela_, and white; those of the lower\r\njaw are larger and stronger: the grinders are four on each side;\r\nthey are broad, trifid, with the middle lobe sharp and very long:\r\nthe tusks, or dogteeth, are very strong, curved, and approximated,\r\nleaving a very small place for the incisores, which are very\r\nsmall, very short, and flat; the two lateral ones on each side are\r\nsituated diagonally, the second behind, and the two middle ones are\r\nonly half the size of the others. The tail is bushy, particularly\r\nat the top, where there is a white pencil of long hairs; the brown\r\nof the remainder is darker than on the body.\r\n\r\nFrom the above accurate description, it will appear evident that\r\nthis animal is very different from the common marten of North\r\nAmerica. It must be a ferocious little animal, and very fierce;\r\nwhich is indicated by the strength of the teeth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XVIII. _Natural History of the Scytalus Cupreus, or\r\nCopper-head Snake._ By C. S. RAFINESQUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the rattlesnake, the copper-head snake is the most dreaded\r\nin the northern states, being the next largest venomous snake: he\r\nis also more common in the cold parts, where the former is very\r\nrare. Strange as it may seem, this conspicuous and dangerous animal\r\nhas escaped the notice of naturalists, and is not found described\r\nin Shaw nor Lacepede. Having seen two of them near Fishkill, in\r\nthe summer of 1817, I endeavoured to describe them completely, and\r\ninvestigate their history. They were both killed in a meadow, and\r\none of them while sleeping coiled up near a fence; a slight stroke\r\nof a rod was sufficient, as usual with venomous snakes. It appears\r\nthat they are killed much easier than the innocent snakes; these\r\nare often seen to revive after an apparent death, and do not really\r\ndie until the next sunset; while venomous snakes do not easily\r\nrevive, particularly if the head is slightly bruised.\r\n\r\nThis snake is known by a variety of names in different parts of\r\nthe State of New-York, since he has every where attracted the\r\nattention of the inhabitants: these names are, _copper-head_,\r\n_copper-snake_, _chunk-head_, _copper-adder_, _copper-viper_,\r\n_copper-belly_, _pilot-snake_, _deaf-adder_, _deaf-snake_; and in\r\nNew-England, by the names _rattlesnake's mate_ and _red adder_, &c.\r\nThey have all been given in reference to his colour, or to some\r\npresumed peculiarities in his manners, &c. _Chunk-head_ is a vulgar\r\nexpression, meaning thick-head or blunt-head. He has been called\r\nsometimes _pilot-snake_, on a false supposition that he was the\r\npilot or guide of the rattlesnake; and he has been considered as\r\ndeaf, because he is easily surprised, and does not appear to hear\r\nthe noise of your approach.\r\n\r\nIt belongs to the genus _scytalus_ of Daudin, &c., which differs\r\nfrom the _Boa_ of Linnæus, as the genus _Vipera_ does from\r\n_Coluber_, being provided with fangs. I have given to it the name\r\nof _Scytalus Cupreus_, which means coppered scytalus. The following\r\ndefinition of the species may be considered as comparative and\r\ncharacteristic.\r\n\r\n_Scytalus Cupreus._ Tail one-eighth of total length, with 45 caudal\r\nplates entirely brown; 150 abdominal plates, the last very broad;\r\nhead oval, coppered above, yellow underneath; scales carinated on\r\nthe back, which is coppered, with reddish brown rings cross-shaped;\r\nbelly variegated of brownish.\r\n\r\n_Description._ Total length about three feet; body thicker than in\r\nthe innocent snakes. Head large, broad, oval, obtuse, very distinct\r\nfrom the neck, nearly two inches long, flattened, coppered brown\r\nabove, and covered with large, smooth scales; yellow underneath,\r\nas well as the neck, and with rhomboidal smooth scales. Mouth very\r\nlarge; fangs yellowish white. Back flattened anteriorly, a little\r\nangular in the middle, covered with small rhomboidal, obtuse,\r\nkeeled scales; those of the sides larger and smooth, not keeled;\r\ncentre of the back of a brownish copper colour; sides of a bright\r\ncopper; broad bands or rings, becoming forked on each side, and\r\nassuming nearly the shape of a St. Andrew's cross; they are of a\r\nreddish brown: there is a round spot opposite to the sinusses, and\r\nthe scales of the sides are minutely dotted of brown. The abdominal\r\nplates are 150, beginning under the head; the last, covering the\r\nvent, is very broad, double the other: they are of a shining, pale\r\ncopper colour, with two longitudinal and lateral rows of great,\r\nirregular, brown spots, with some light brownish clouds between\r\nthem, and each plate is marginated of whitish. The belly is very\r\nflat and broad, about 1¼ inch in diameter; and the skin may be\r\ndistended on the sides, when, the animal is not fed. Tail short,\r\ntapering gradually, about four inches long, cylindrical, brown,\r\nwithout spots, with 45 plates underneath, and having at the end a\r\nsmall, obtuse, horn claw, of an oblong, compressed, obtuse shape,\r\nand carinated underneath.\r\n\r\nThis snake has many of the habits of the rattlesnake; he is very\r\nslow in his motions, rather clumsy, owing to his thick shape and\r\nshort tail. He retires in winter into caves, hollow rocks, and\r\ntrees, where he lies, in a torpid state, from November to April;\r\nseveral have been found coiled up together, the head lying over the\r\nback: it is in the same situation he sleeps in the fields. When\r\nfound in the torpid state, they may be carried without waking; but\r\nmight wake in a warm room. They do not eat during all that time:\r\ntheir food consists of birds, frogs, mice, and even squirrels,\r\nwhich they catch by surprise, as they do not climb on trees. They\r\nkill their large prey by breathing a poisonous effluvia, crushing\r\nit in their folds, and they swallow it whole after covering it with\r\ntheir clammy saliva. They can remain a very long time without a\r\nmeal, and one meal is a long time digesting.\r\n\r\nThey are generally found in meadows, pastures, and the edge of\r\nwoods. They creep slovenly through the grass, and if surprised by\r\nthe sight of man, they assume an erect and threatening posture,\r\ndarting their tongue and swelling their head; but they do not\r\nattack men, unless alarmed and struck. They are considered more\r\ndangerous than the rattlesnake, because they do not give notice of\r\ntheir vicinity, and lie concealed in the grass; but they are easily\r\nkilled, when assuming the threatening posture, by a slight touch\r\nof a cane, spade, or any other instrument. The effects of their\r\nbite is similar to that of the rattlesnake, and cured in the same\r\nway, by the prompt application of the _Aristolochia serpentaria_,\r\n_Polygala senega_, _Prenanthes serpentaria_, _Macrotry\r\nserpentaria_, &c. and other plants, bearing in consequence the name\r\nof snakeroots.\r\n\r\nThis snake is found in New-England, New-York, New-Jersey,\r\nPennsylvania, &c., and perhaps all over the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XIX. _On a Method of Augmenting the Force of Gunpowder._\r\n\r\nExtract of a Letter to the Editor, from Colonel GEORGE GIBBS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI employed, the last year, a man in blowing rocks, and having seen\r\nan account of a method of substituting a portion of quick lime for\r\na part of the gunpowder usually employed, I was induced to make\r\na number of experiments upon it. I now send you the results in\r\nthe certificate of the person employed, whose statement might be\r\nrelied on, even if I had not superintended myself a number of the\r\nexperiments.\r\n\r\n\"_Sunswick Farms, Oct. 19, 1817._--I certify that, having been\r\nemployed by Colonel Gibbs in blasting rocks on his farm, I, by his\r\norders, made use of a composition of one part quick lime and two\r\nparts gunpowder, and uniformly found the same charge to answer\r\nequally well with a like quantity of gunpowder. I made upwards\r\nof fifty blasts in this manner, as well as several hundreds in\r\nthe usual way, and can therefore depend upon the accuracy of this\r\nstatement. I found, however, that when the powdered lime was mixed\r\nwith the gunpowder the day before, that the effect was diminished.\r\nIt should be always used the day it is mixed.\r\n\r\n  (Signed)        T. POMEROY.\"\r\n\r\nThis preparation was made generally in the morning, put in a\r\nbottle and well corked, to prevent the access of the external air.\r\nThe rationale of the process was not explained in the original\r\nrecommendation, but it soon occurred to me, that it must be owing\r\nto the desiccation of the gunpowder by the lime.\r\n\r\nThe attraction of moisture by gunpowder, is known to be very great:\r\naccording to Rees's Cyclopedia, upwards of 16 per cent. has been\r\nabsorbed, and that the removal, simply, from near the fire to the\r\ncorner of the room, produces a considerable change in its weight.\r\nI presume, therefore, that the lime, which in its caustic state\r\nhas also a great affinity to water, attracts a portion of it from\r\nthe powder, and leaves it in a state of dryness best fitted for\r\ninflammation. But if the lime should remain too long mixed with\r\nthe powder, it would probably attack the water of crystallization\r\nof the saltpetre, and, according to Count Rumford's idea, destroy\r\na great part of the power. If also left exposed, attractions of\r\nmoisture would take place from the atmosphere, the gunpowder would\r\nremain surcharged with humidity as before, and the lime would be\r\nonly an inert mass.\r\n\r\nThe examination of this subject led me to consider the increase\r\nof the power of gunpowder in various situations, and of its use\r\nin the field. It is well known that after a few discharges a\r\ncannon becomes heated, and the range is much greater, as well as\r\nthe recoil. The charge of powder is therefore reduced about one\r\nquarter, to produce the original effect. As I have not heard or\r\nseen any explanation of this fact I shall take this opportunity of\r\nmentioning, that it appears to arise from the same cause as the\r\nfirst explained, viz. the desiccation of the powder. No person will\r\ndispute the heat acquired by a cannon, or even a musket, after\r\nrepeated discharges; and this heat must volatilize or destroy a\r\ngreat portion of the moisture combined with the powder, assist its\r\nspeedy inflammation, and perhaps add to its power, by causing a\r\nmore perfect combustion of the inflammable parts of the gunpowder.\r\nThis would cause a much greater volume of gas to be produced, and\r\nthe high temperature would also greatly augment its elasticity;\r\nand it is well known that the effects of gunpowder depend upon the\r\nrapid production and high degree of elasticity of a great quantity\r\nof aeriform fluids or gases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XX. _On The Connexion between Magnetism and Light._ By Col.\r\nGIBBS.\r\n\r\n_Extract from a Letter to the Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\nI visited, the last year, the mine of magnetic iron at Succassunny,\r\nbelonging to Governor Dickerson of New-Jersey. The mine had\r\nnot been worked for a year past, and I did not descend it. The\r\nproprietor, a gentleman of distinguished science, informed me of\r\na singular circumstance attending it, which was too important to\r\nbe left unnoticed. The mine is worked at the depth of 100 feet;\r\ndirection of the bed, northeast and southwest; inclination nearly\r\nperpendicular. The ore in the upper part of the bed is magnetic,\r\nand has polarity; but that raised from the bottom has no magnetism\r\nat first, but acquires it after it has been some time exposed to\r\nthe influence of the atmosphere. This fact, of which there is\r\nno doubt, struck me as most singular. I could not recollect any\r\nsimilar observation; and it is only lately that I have found that\r\nWerner had observed, that iron sand, raised from the depth of 100\r\nfeet, had no magnetism. See Rees's Cyclopedia, Art. Sand.\r\n\r\nI could only account for this circumstance by supposing that\r\nmagnetism existed not in the interior of the earth, as was\r\nsupposed, but only on the surface, and in such bodies as received\r\nthis principle from atmospheric, or celestial influence.\r\n\r\nThe late discovery of the magnetic influence of the violet rays\r\nof light, by M. Morechini, a notice of which has since reached\r\nus in the journals, connected with the above fact, leads me to\r\nbelieve that light is the great source of magnetism. A learned\r\nforeigner,[13] whose residence in this country has contributed much\r\nto its scientific improvement, has also informed me that other\r\nsubstances than metallic have been found, by compression, to be\r\nmagnetic.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the violet ray is the most refrangible, or\r\nhas the most attraction to matter. But there are other rays, which\r\nHerschel, who some years since discovered them, calls invisible\r\nrays, which are still more refrangible, are next beyond the violet,\r\nwhen refracted, and partake of most of its properties, except\r\nthat they are invisible. I have not yet seen any account of the\r\nexperiments of M. Morechini, other than the notice in the journal;\r\nbut I trust I shall soon be able to determine whether those\r\ninvisible rays do not possess the magnetic power as well as the\r\nviolet; or, perhaps, possess it exclusively.\r\n\r\nAs the refraction of the atmosphere in the polar circles, is at\r\nleast ten times greater than in the tropics, a greater quantity\r\nof the magnetic rays will there be separated and combined than\r\nelsewhere; and of course arises excess of magnetism. Hence the\r\ndirection of magnetic bodies towards the northern and southern\r\nextreme regions. The great absorption and emission of light in the\r\npolar regions, by the ice and snow, may cause the extraordinary\r\nillumination of that country during the absence of the sun, and the\r\nemission of the magnetic rays with electricity may, perhaps, give\r\nus the aurora borealis.\r\n\r\nThe coincidence of the diurnal variation of the compass with\r\nthe solar influence, deserves particular notice, and will have\r\nconsiderable weight on this subject.\r\n\r\nThat there are many facts which cannot readily be explained by\r\nthe theory of light, I shall not deny; but in the infancy of\r\nthis system we may be allowed to hope that future observations\r\nmay enable us to remove present difficulties. One thing must be\r\nadmitted, that no theory has heretofore been published relating to\r\nmagnetism, which has received or seems entitled to much confidence.\r\nIn your next number I hope to be able to furnish you with further\r\nremarks on this subject; but, I have no doubt that philosophy\r\nwill finally determine that we owe to the solar ray light, heat,\r\nelectricity, and magnetism.\r\n\r\n  G.

Sullivan, Esq. of Boston._\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOSTON, May 7, 1818.\r\n\r\n  _To Professor Silliman._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\nIf the following account of a method of using tar and steam as\r\nfuel, recently invented by Mr. Samuel Morey, should be found\r\nsufficiently interesting to occupy a place in the Journal of\r\nScience, I am sensible its usefulness will be much extended through\r\nthat medium of information.\r\n\r\nThe inventor, not unskilled in chemistry, and aware of the\r\nattraction of oxygen for carbon, conceived it practicable to\r\nconvert the constituents of water into fuel, by means of this\r\naffinity.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the fact, chemically considered, the operation,\r\nin various experiments, promises to afford a convenient method of\r\napplying to use several of the most combustible substances, not\r\nhitherto employed as fuel. By the process I shall briefly describe,\r\n_all carbonaceous fluids_ may be conveniently burnt, and derive\r\ngreat force from their combination with the oxygen and hydrogen\r\ngases of water or steam, before or at the moment of ignition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW FIRE APPARATUS.\r\n\r\nFig. 1.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.]\r\n\r\nA tight vessel, cylindrically shaped, was first employed,\r\ncontaining rosin, connected with a small boiler by a pipe which\r\nentered near the bottom, and extended nearly its length, having\r\nsmall apertures, over which were two inverted gutters, inclining\r\nor sloping upwards over each other; the upper one longer than the\r\nother, intended to detain the steam in the rosin, in its way to\r\nthe surface. The rosin being heated, _carburetted hydrogen gas_\r\nwould issue from the outlet, or pipe, inserted near the top of the\r\nvessel, and being ignited, afforded a small blaze, about as large\r\nas that of a candle; but, when the steam was allowed to flow, this\r\nblaze would instantly shoot out many hundred times its former bulk,\r\nto the distance of two or three feet.\r\n\r\nIt is presumed the steam was decomposed, and carburetted hydrogen\r\nand carbonic oxide, or carbonic acid, produced as the steam passed,\r\nvery near the hot bottom of the vessel.\r\n\r\nAnother apparatus was constructed, consisting of two vessels, one\r\nwithin the other, having a cover common to both; the inner one to\r\ncontain _tar_, (as a more convenient substance than rosin;) the\r\nouter vessel to contain water, which surrounds the other, and lies\r\nunder its bottom; or, in other words, a vessel of tar set into a\r\nvessel of boiling water. The boiler has a lining of sheet copper,\r\nor tin, to promote the ebullition. The tar vessel being riveted to\r\nthe cover, holes are made through its sides, near to the cover,\r\nto allow the steam to pass in, and act on its surface. The cover\r\nbeing secured on, a safety valve is provided for the steam vessel,\r\nand two cocks; one over the tar, the other over the water, are\r\nfixed contiguously; the first has a tube, or is elongated to reach\r\nnearly to the bottom of the tar, which ascends, and is driven out\r\nby the pressure of the steam on its surface. Both cocks conduct\r\nto a pipe, wherein is placed a large wire, or metallic rod, which\r\nabout fills the tube, and is perforated obliquely, or zig zag, to\r\nincrease the length of the passage, and to mingle the tar and steam\r\nmore intimately. The gases, or vapours, issue from a small orifice\r\nat the end of the pipe; and, being ignited by a little fire, into\r\nwhich it is directed, an intense and voluminous blaze is produced,\r\nand continues as long as the materials remain unexhausted. A hot\r\nbrick, instead of the fire, answers the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus contained but about one quart of tar, (which must\r\nalways be nicely strained,) and it lasted one and a half hour,\r\nand the flame was sufficient to fill a common fireplace, if not\r\nallowed to escape, by its violence, up the chimney. Its force will\r\nbe according to the elasticity of the steam. I regret being unable,\r\nsince, to make more exact and varied experiments, to demonstrate\r\nthe economy of this fuel. This point, however, and the chemical\r\nfacts, will be the subject of a future communication. And probably\r\na form of a stove may be devised, wherein it may be used for the\r\npurposes of warmth, light, and cooking; and another apparatus to\r\nlight streets.\r\n\r\nBut this invention will be of more special use _as fuel for steam\r\nengines applied to navigation_--the purpose principally for which I\r\nhave purchased the patent right.\r\n\r\nThis may be the subject of another communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XXII. _On the Changes which have taken place in the Wells of\r\nWater situated in Columbia, South-Carolina, since the Earthquakes\r\nof 1811-12._ By EDWARD DARRELL SMITH, M. D., _Professor of Chemical\r\nand Experimental Philosophy and Mineralogy in the South-Carolina\r\nCollege_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To Professor Silliman._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIn answer to your inquiry respecting the changes in our wells,\r\nsince the memorable period of the earthquakes, I would make the\r\nfollowing observations:\r\n\r\nThese tremendous convulsions of nature commenced in December, 1811,\r\nand were continued, at intervals, until the latter end of the\r\nsucceeding month of March, with different degrees of violence, in\r\nthis and some of the adjacent states. In November, 1812, I visited\r\nthis town, and then understood that the wells, which are generally\r\nvery deep, had an abundance of water in them. This continued to\r\nbe the case for about one year after; and in the College well, in\r\nparticular, which was a remarkably fine one, there were always\r\nabout twelve feet of water, notwithstanding its daily consumption\r\nby more than two hundred persons. Shortly after this time, many\r\nof the wells in the town began to fail in their usual supply of\r\nwater, although they were frequently cleaned out and occasionally\r\ndeepened. Their state became worse every year, until, at length,\r\nabout three years since, some of them proved to be entirely dry,\r\nand most of the others had their water turbid, and diminished\r\nto the depth of only two or three feet. A little anterior to\r\nthis period, what were called the dry years had commenced, and\r\nthere were, comparatively, very scanty falls of rain until the\r\nlast spring; since when there has been a very large quantity. To\r\nelucidate the subject more fully, it may not be amiss to give some\r\ntopographical account of the town of Columbia. About a mile from\r\nthe eastern bank of the Cogaree the town begins to be thickly built\r\nup, and at this distance the elevation of ground is supposed to\r\nbe one hundred feet above the level of the river in its ordinary\r\nstate. The hill is then tolerably level for the space of a mile or\r\nmore in its western extent, and its soil is principally composed of\r\na loose, porous sand, with which few, if any, stones are intermixed\r\nat any depth that has yet been penetrated. In attempting to account\r\nfor the failure of the well-waters, it was supposed by some that\r\nthe earthquakes had produced such changes in the loose texture of\r\nthe soils, that the veins of water which used to supply the wells,\r\nhad sunk beneath the level of these reservoirs; but on this head it\r\nis to be observed, that there was no remarkable failure of water\r\nfor one or two years after these changes were supposed to have\r\nbeen effected. Others again, connecting the greatest failure of\r\nwater with the concurring dearth of rain, conceived that the fact\r\nmight be explained by the droughts occasioning a deficiency in the\r\nriver-water, and thus cutting off the supply which they supposed\r\nhad heretofore percolated from the margin of the river into the\r\nwells. If their hypothesis was correct, it was believed that the\r\ndifficulty would be removed, either by deepening the wells, or by\r\nsubsequent large supplies of rain. Many wells were immediately\r\ndeepened from two to eight or ten feet, but the remedy proved\r\nvery inadequate. And since the great falls of rain, within a year\r\npast, although there are somewhat larger supplies of water in some\r\nwells, yet there is not the half as much as existed before the\r\nearthquakes. The College well, although deepened several feet, does\r\nnot now contain generally more than four or five feet of water. I\r\nmust not omit to remark, that two wells, situated in a longitudinal\r\nline from north to south, with regard to each other, and also\r\nin a lower spot of ground, never failed entirely, although they\r\ndiminished considerably, and now yield more copious supplies than\r\nany others.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the cause of this phenomenon, the effects are so\r\ninconvenient, and it is so generally believed that they are likely\r\nto be permanent, that the inhabitants of the town are beginning to\r\nbuild cisterns, in order to accumulate artificial reservoirs of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XXIII. _Respiration of Oxygen Gas._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not extraordinary, when oxygen gas was first discovered, and\r\nfound to be the principle of life to the whole animal creation,\r\nthat extravagant expectations should have been formed as to its\r\nmedicinal application. Disappointment followed of course, and\r\nnaturally led to a neglect of the subject; and, in fact, for some\r\nyears, pneumatic medicine has gone into discredit, and public\r\nopinion has vibrated to the extreme of incredulity. Partaking in\r\na degree in this feeling, we listened with some reluctance to a\r\nvery pressing application on this subject during the last summer. A\r\nyoung lady, apparently in the last stages of decline, and supposed\r\nto be affected with hydrothorax, was pronounced beyond the reach of\r\nordinary medical aid. As she was in a remote town in Connecticut,\r\nwhere no facilities existed towards the attainment of the object,\r\nwe felt no confidence that, even if oxygen gas were possessed of\r\nany efficacy in such cases, it would _actually_ be applied in this\r\ncase, in such a manner as to do any good. Yielding, however, to\r\nthe anxious wishes of friends, we furnished drawings for such an\r\napparatus as might be presumed attainable, and also written and\r\nminute directions for preparing, trying, and administering the gas.\r\nIt was obtained from nitrate of potash, (saltpetre,) not because it\r\nwas the best process, but because the substance could be obtained\r\nin the place, and because a common fire would serve for its\r\nextrication. The gas obtained had, of course, a variable mixture of\r\nnitrogen or azot, and probably on an average, might not be purer\r\nthan nearly the _reversed_ proportions of the atmosphere--that is,\r\n70 to 80 per cent. of oxygen to 20 or 30 nitrogen; and it is worthy\r\nof observation, whether this circumstance might not have influenced\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\nContrary to our expectations, the gas (as we are since informed\r\nby good authority) was skilfully prepared and perseveringly used.\r\nFrom the first, the difficulty of breathing and other oppressive\r\naffections were relieved: the young lady grew rapidly better,\r\nand in a few weeks entirely recovered her health. A respectable\r\nphysician, conversant with the case, states, in a letter now before\r\nus, \"that the inhaling of the oxygen gas relieved the difficulty of\r\nbreathing, increased the operation of diuretics, _and has effected\r\nher cure_. Whether her disease was hydrothorax, or an anasarcous\r\naffection of the lungs, is a matter I believe not settled.\"\r\n\r\nShould the revival of the experiments on the respiration of oxygen\r\ngas appear to be desired, it would not be difficult to simplify the\r\napparatus and operations so as to bring them within the reach of an\r\nintelligent person, even although ignorant of chemistry: and this\r\ntask, should there be occasion, we would cheerfully undertake to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nThis interesting class of experiments ought to be resumed, not with\r\nthe spirit of quackery, or of extravagant expectation, but with the\r\nsobriety of philosophical research; and it is more than probable\r\nthat the nitrous oxyde which is now little more than a subject of\r\nmerriment and wonder, if properly diluted and discreetly applied,\r\nwould be productive of valuable effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XXIV. _On the Compound Blowpipe. Extract from the Journal de\r\nPhysique, of Paris, for January 1818._[14]\r\n\r\nCONCERNING HEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Heat, considered as one of the most important agents, especially\r\nin relation to chemistry, and even to mineralogy, has also been\r\nthe subject of numerous labours, both with regard to the means of\r\naugmenting and of diminishing its effects.\r\n\r\n\"To the former belong the numerous experiments made, especially in\r\nEngland, with the blowpipe, supplied by a mixture of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen gases. Mr. Clarke has evidently been more extensively\r\nengaged in these researches than any other person, as our readers\r\nhave perceived in the extracts which we have given from the labours\r\nof this learned chemist; but it is proper also to give publicity to\r\nthe protest (réclamation) made to us in favour of Mr. Silliman.\r\n\r\n\"We have already stated that Mr. Hare, of Philadelphia, first\r\nconceived the idea of forming a blowpipe with explosive gas; but\r\nas we have not been conversant with the memoirs of the Society of\r\nArts and Sciences of Connecticut, we have not made mention of Mr.\r\nSilliman.\r\n\r\n\"The fact is, that this chemist, Professor at New-Haven, published,\r\non the 7th of May,[15] 1812, a memoir containing the results of\r\nexperiments made upon a very great number of bodies, until that\r\ntime reputed to be infusible; and, among others, upon the alkaline\r\nearths, the decomposition of which he effected.\r\n\r\n\"The experiments of Mr. Clarke were therefore subsequent; but,\r\nhaving been made upon a still more extensive list of substances,\r\nthey are scarcely less interesting.\r\n\r\n\"It results then, from the experiments of Messrs. Hare, Silliman,\r\nClarke, Murray, and Ridolfi, that there is really no substance\r\nwhich is infusible in the degree of heat produced by this kind of\r\nblowpipe.\r\n\r\n\"In this new department of physics, it is attempted not only to\r\napply the blowpipe to a very great number of bodies, but so to\r\nmodify the instrument or apparatus as to give it the highest degree\r\nof convenience, and especially to obviate the danger of explosion.\"\r\n\r\n  pp. 38 & 39.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nAs the results produced by Mr. Hare's Compound Blowpipe, fed by\r\noxygen and hydrogen gases, continue to be mentioned in Europe,\r\nin many of the Journals, without any reference to the results\r\nlong since obtained in this country, we republish the following\r\nstatement of facts, which was, in substance, first published in\r\nNew-York, more than a year since. It should be observed, that\r\nMr. Tilloch has since published, in the Philosophical Magazine\r\nin London, the memoir which contained the American results, and\r\nthere have been some other allusions to it in different European\r\nJournals, and to Mr. Hare's previous experiments; but still this\r\ninteresting class of results continue to be attributed to others\r\nthan their original discoverers.\r\n\r\n  _Yale College, April 7, 1817._\r\n\r\nVarious notices, more or less complete, chiefly copied from English\r\nnewspapers, are now going the round of the public prints in this\r\ncountry, stating that \"_a new kind of fire_\" has been discovered\r\nin England, or, at least, new and heretofore unparalleled means\r\nof exciting heat, by which the gems, and all the most refractory\r\nsubstances in nature, are immediately melted, and even in various\r\ninstances dissipated in vapour, or decomposed into their elements.\r\nThe first glance at these statements, (which, as regards the\r\neffects, I have no doubt are substantially true,) was sufficient\r\nto satisfy me, that the basis of these discoveries was laid by\r\nan American discovery, made by Mr. Robert Hare of Philadelphia,\r\nin 1801. In December of that year, Mr. Hare communicated to the\r\nChemical Society of Philadelphia his discovery of a method of\r\nburning oxygen and hydrogen gases in a united stream, so as to\r\nproduce a very intense heat.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, he published a detailed memoir on the subject, with\r\nan engraving of his apparatus, and he recited the effects of\r\nhis instrument; some of which, in the degree of heat produced,\r\nsurpassed any thing before known.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, and 1803, I was occupied with him, in Philadelphia, in\r\nprosecuting similar experiments on a more extended scale; and a\r\ncommunication on the subject was made to the Philosophical Society\r\nof Philadelphia. The memoir is printed in their transactions;\r\nand Mr. Hare's original memoir was reprinted in the Annals of\r\nChemistry, in Paris, and in the Philosophical Magazine, in London.\r\n\r\nMr. Murray, in his System of Chemistry, has mentioned Mr. Hare's\r\nresults in the fusion of several of the earths, &c. and has given\r\nhim credit for his discovery.\r\n\r\nIn one instance, while in Europe, in 1806, at a public lecture, I\r\nsaw some of them exhibited by a celebrated Professor, who mentioned\r\nMr. Hare as the reputed author of the invention.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1811, I instituted an extended course of experiments\r\nwith Mr. Hare's blowpipe, in which I melted lime and magnesia, and\r\na long list of the most refractory minerals, gems, and others, the\r\ngreater part of which had never been melted before, and I supposed\r\nthat I had decomposed lime, barytes, strontites, and magnesia,\r\nevolving their metallic basis, which burnt in the air as fast as\r\nproduced. I communicated a detailed account of my experiments to\r\nthe Connecticut Academy of Arts and Sciences, who published it in\r\ntheir Transactions for 1812; with their leave it was communicated\r\nto Dr Bruce's Mineralogical Journal, and it was printed in the 4th\r\nnumber of that work. Hundreds of my pupils can testify that Mr.\r\nHare's splendid experiments, and many others performed with his\r\nblowpipe, fed by oxygen and hydrogen gases, have been for years\r\npast annually exhibited, in my public courses of chemistry in Yale\r\nCollege, and that the fusion and volatilization of platina, and\r\nthe combustion of that metal, and of gold and silver, and of many\r\nother metals; that the fusion of the earths, of rock crystal, of\r\ngun flint, of the corundum gems, and many other, very refractory\r\nsubstances; and the production of light beyond the brightness of\r\nthe sun, have been familiar experiments in my laboratory. I have\r\nuniformly given Mr. Hare the full credit of the invention, although\r\nmy researches, with his instrument, had been pushed farther than\r\nhis own, and a good many new results added.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore with no small surprise that, in the Annales de\r\nChimie et de Physique, for September, 1816, I found a translation\r\nof a very elaborate memoir, from a Scientific Journal, published\r\nat the Royal Institution in London, in which a full account is\r\ngiven of a very interesting series of experiments performed by\r\nmeans of Mr. Hare's instrument; or rather one somewhat differently\r\narranged, but depending on the same principle. Mr. Hare's invention\r\nis slightly mentioned in a note, but no mention is made of his\r\nexperiments, or of mine.\r\n\r\nOn a comparison of the memoir in question with Mr. Hare's and with\r\nmy own, I find that very many of the results are identical, and all\r\nthe new ones are derived directly from Mr. Hare's invention, with\r\nthe following differences.--In Mr. Hare's, the two gases were in\r\ndistinct reservoirs, to prevent explosion; they were propelled by\r\nthe pressure of a column of water, and were made to mingle, just\r\nbefore their exit, at a common orifice. In the English apparatus,\r\nthe gases are both in one reservoir, and they are propelled by\r\ntheir own elasticity, after condensation, by a syringe.\r\n\r\nProfessor Clarke, of Cambridge University, the celebrated\r\ntraveller, is the author of the memoir in question; and we must\r\npresume that he was ignorant of what had been done by Mr. Hare and\r\nmyself, or he would candidly have adverted to the facts.\r\n\r\nIt is proper that the public should know that Mr. Hare was the\r\nauthor of the invention, by means of which, in Europe, they are now\r\nperforming the most brilliant and beautiful experiments; and that\r\nthere are very few of these results hitherto obtained there, by the\r\nuse of it, (and the publication of which has there excited great\r\ninterest,) which were not, several years ago, anticipated here,\r\neither by Mr. Hare or by myself.\r\n\r\nAs I have cited only printed documents, or the testimony of living\r\nwitnesses, I trust the public will not consider this communication\r\nas indelicate, or arrogant, but simply a matter of justice to the\r\ninterests of American science, and particularly to Mr. Hare.\r\n\r\n  BENJAMIN SILLIMAN,\r\n  _Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy in Yale College._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XXV. _The Northwest Passage, the North Pole, and the Greenland\r\nIce._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn looking over the foreign journals, we find no articles of\r\nintelligence so interesting as those which respect the three\r\nsubjects mentioned above. Indeed, as they have found their way into\r\nmost of our newspapers, it is now generally known in this country,\r\nthat, in consequence of the reported breaking up of the Greenland\r\nice, an expedition has already left England, in two divisions,\r\nthe one for the purpose of exploring a northwest passage to Asia,\r\naround the North American continent, by the way of Davis's Straits;\r\nthe other, for effecting the same object _by passing over the north\r\npole_.\r\n\r\nIf Horace thought that man almost impiously daring who first\r\nadventured upon the open sea, what shall we say of the hardihood of\r\nthe attempt to visit THE POLE?--the pole, which it is impossible\r\nto contemplate without awe--which, in all probability, has never\r\nbeen visited by any living being--where the dreary solitude has\r\nnever been broken by human voice--where the sound of war has never\r\nbeen heard, and darkness and cold exert an almost undisputed\r\ndominion! What must be the emotions of that man who first stands\r\nupon the point of the earth's axis! Who, no longer partaking of the\r\nrevolution, in circles of latitude, slowly revolves on the axis of\r\nhis own body, once in twenty-four hours--to whom the sun does not\r\nrise or set, but, moving in a course very oblique to the horizon,\r\nmakes scarcely a perceptible progress in twenty-four hours, and at\r\nthe end of three months, when he has attained his noon, is only 23°\r\n28′, on the arc of a vertical circle, above the horizon--to whom\r\nlongitude is extinct, and who can move in no possible direction but\r\nsouth--to whom the stars are a blank, and to whom the polar star,\r\ncould he see it, would appear in the zenith. Such are some of the\r\nmost obvious results of a position on the pole. The man who first\r\nestablishes himself on this sublime point, will have more reason\r\nfor self-congratulation than he who led the Persian myriads into\r\nGreece, or he who pushed the Macedonians to the Indus.\r\n\r\nOn these interesting subjects, we beg leave to refer our readers to\r\na very able treatise in the Quarterly Review for February, 1818,\r\nwhere all the topics at the head of this article are discussed with\r\nmuch learning and ability.--We extract the following passage:\r\n\r\n\"If an open navigation should be discovered across the polar basin,\r\nthe passage over the pole or close to it, will be one of the most\r\ninteresting events to science that has ever occurred. It will be\r\nthe first time that the problem was practically solved with which\r\nthe learners of geography are sometimes puzzled--that of going the\r\nshortest way between two places lying east and west, by taking\r\na direction of north and south. The passage of the pole will\r\nrequire the undivided attention of the navigator. On approaching\r\nthis point, from which the northern coasts of Europe, Asia, and\r\nAmerica, and every part of them, will bear _south_ of him, nothing\r\ncan possibly assist him in determining his course, and keeping on\r\nthe right meridian of his destined place, but a correct knowledge\r\nof the _time_: and yet no means of ascertaining that time will\r\nbe afforded him. The only _time_ he can have, with any degree of\r\ncertainty, as long as he remains on or near the pole, must be that\r\nof Greenwich, and this he can know only from good chronometers;\r\nfor, from the general hazy state of the atmosphere, and\r\nparticularly about the horizon, and the sameness in the altitude of\r\nthe sun at every hour in the four-and-twenty, he must not expect to\r\nobtain an approximation even of the apparent time, by observation,\r\nand he will have no stars to assist him. All his ideas respecting\r\nthe heavens and the reckonings of his time will be reversed, and\r\nthe change not gradual, as in proceeding from the east to the west,\r\nor the contrary, but instantaneous. The magnetic needle will point\r\nto its unknown magnetic pole, or fly around from the point of the\r\nbowl in which it is suspended, and that which indicated north will\r\nnow be south; the east will become the west, and the hour of noon\r\nwill be that of midnight.\r\n\r\n\"These curious circumstances will probably be considered to mark\r\nthe passage by the pole, as the most interesting of the two, while\r\nit will perhaps be found equally easy. We have, indeed, very little\r\ndoubt, that if the polar basin should prove to be free from land\r\nabout the pole, it will also be free of ice. A sea of more than\r\ntwo thousand miles in diameter, of unfathomable depth, (which\r\nis the case between Greenland and Spitzbergen,) and in constant\r\nmotion, is not likely to be frozen over at any time. But if all\r\nendeavours to discover a passage to the Pacific by either route\r\nshould prove unavailing, it will still be satisfactory to have\r\nremoved every doubt on this subject by ascertaining the fact. In\r\nmaking the attempt, many objects interesting and important to\r\nscience will present themselves to the observation of those who\r\nare engaged in the two expeditions. That which proceeds up Davis's\r\nStraits, will have an opportunity of adjusting the geography of the\r\nnortheast coast of America, and the west coast of Greenland; and of\r\nascertaining whether the latter be not an island or an archipelago\r\nof islands; and much curious information may be expected from both.\r\n\r\n\"They will ascertain, what is as yet but very imperfectly known,\r\nthe depth, the temperature, the saltness, and the specific gravity\r\nof the sea-water in those high latitudes--the velocity of the\r\ncurrents, the state of atmospherical electricity in the arctic\r\nregions, and its connexion, at which we have glanced, with the\r\ninclination, declination, and intensity of force of the magnetic\r\nneedle; on which subject alone, a collection of facts towards the\r\nupper part of Davis's Straits would be worth a voyage of discovery.\r\nIt has, indeed, been long suspected that one of the magnetic\r\npoles will be found in this neighbourhood, as in no part of the\r\nworld have such extraordinary phenomena been observed, or such\r\nirregularities in the vibration and the variation of the needle.\r\n\r\n\"A comparison of the magnetic influence near the pole, with what\r\nit has been observed to be on the equator, might lead to important\r\nresults; and the swinging of a pendulum as near the pole as can\r\nbe approached, to compare with the oscillations observed in the\r\nShetland Islands, and in the southern hemisphere, would be a great\r\npoint gained for science.\"\r\n\r\nWe have no room in this Number to consider the probability of\r\nsuccess in this attempt, nor the question, whether the breaking\r\nup of the Greenland ice, and its passage to, and dissolution in,\r\nthe south, have been attended with a chilling influence on the\r\ncontinents. That such a chilling effect might be extensively\r\nexerted, is certainly credible. Approaching some of the icebergs,\r\nin April 1805, on the shoals of Newfoundland, we were rendered very\r\nsensible of the vicinity of such dangerous neighbours, by the great\r\nchill in the air, long before they were visible; and when we had\r\npassed them, the weather again grew milder.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it militates against the probability of finding the\r\nnorthern polar basin free of ice, that Captain Cook, in his\r\napproximation to the southern pole, in January, 1773, when in\r\nlatitude 67° 15′ south, \"could proceed no farther; the ice being\r\nentirely closed to the south, in the whole extent from east to\r\nwest-southwest, without the least appearance of any opening.\"\r\nThe advanced season of the year did not, however, permit Captain\r\nCook to ascertain whether he could coast around this ice--whether\r\nit was ultimately attached to land, or was a part of a vast\r\nfield extending to the south pole. This last is however highly\r\nimprobable, because being found about 23° from the pole, it is\r\nhardly credible that it would occupy so extensive a region as to\r\nembrace the pole, and, perhaps extend as much farther beyond;\r\nespecially as in similar latitudes in the opposite hemisphere,\r\nnavigation is comparatively free, and has been pushed even to more\r\nthan 80° of north latitude.\r\n\r\nThe scientific, as well as the commercial world, will wait with\r\nno small impatience for the termination of the two grand arctic\r\nexpeditions, which are among the most original and daring, and may\r\nbe among the most interesting and momentous hitherto undertaken by\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] I trust the public will pardon me for stating, that various\r\nscientific friends, despairing of the revival of the Journal of Dr.\r\nBruce, had, for some time, pressed me to undertake the editing of a\r\nJournal of Science. Considerations of personal friendship prevented\r\nme from listening to such proposals till the decline of Dr. Bruce's\r\nhealth, attended by the most alarming symptoms, rendered it very\r\nobvious that his Journal would not be revived. Towards the close of\r\nlast November, in a personal interview, I communicated to him the\r\ndesign of the present work, at the same time offering to waive it,\r\nprovided he considered it as probable that his own Journal would\r\nbe resumed. Of this, however, he gave no encouragement; but, on\r\nthe contrary, expressed his warm approbation of my undertaking,\r\nauthorized me to consider him as a contributor, and to make public\r\nuse of his name as a patron. It was not till after this that the\r\nannunciation of this work took place; and it is certain that\r\nhad not all hope of the resumption of Dr. Bruce's Journal been\r\ncompletely cut off, _this_ would not have appeared.\r\n\r\n[2] The efforts of Stephen Elliott, Esq. of South Carolina, in\r\nregard to the botany of the Southern States, are particularly\r\nworthy of imitation and praise.\r\n\r\n[3] From the MS. papers of the Connecticut Academy, now published\r\nby permission.\r\n\r\n[4] See Kollmann's Harmony, p. 13, &c.\r\n\r\n[5] Tilloch's Phil. Mag. Vol. XXVIII. p. 140.\r\n\r\n[6] The propriety of making 25 : 36 the true ratio of the 5th will\r\nbe manifest, when it is considered that this is the value of that\r\ninterval as sounded by voices and perfect instruments; when the\r\n3ds which compose it are made perfect. This interval, as found in\r\nthe scale which has the fewest tempered concords possible referred\r\nto at the beginning of this essay, ought to be regarded as the\r\ntrue 5th, flattened by a comma, in the same manner as one of its\r\ncomponent 3ds will be allowed by all to be flattened.\r\n\r\n[7] The propriety of this limitation will be manifest, when we\r\nconsider that in organ music, the chords are generally played\r\nmore full, and are more protracted, than in music for other keyed\r\ninstruments. It is harmony which constitutes its character, in\r\na higher degree than in music for other instruments. Hence the\r\nharmony of the organ ought not to be impaired by including in our\r\ncomputations any music not adapted to it. If a similar examination\r\nof music for the piano-forte would afford a set of results\r\nessentially different from those of this proposition, this is no\r\nproof that it ought to have any concern in a system of temperament\r\ndesigned primarily for the organ, but merely that the same\r\ntemperament cannot be equally adapted to different instruments. If,\r\nas is probable, such an examination would give essentially the same\r\nresults, to introduce them would be superfluous.\r\n\r\n[8] The smaller works of Phillips and Aikin were not then\r\npublished; had they been, they could not have superseded\r\nCleaveland; the same may be said of the respectable work of\r\nProfessor Kidd, of Oxford University.\r\n\r\n[9] A vast region in the interior of New-York and Pennsylvania is\r\nnow fertilized by inexhaustible beds of sulphat of lime, (plaster\r\nof Paris,) which, till a very few years since, were not even known\r\nto exist.\r\n\r\nNear New-Haven immense beds of green marble were discovered in\r\n1811, during a mineralogical excursion: this beautiful material,\r\nclosely resembling the _verd antique_, is now, on the spot,\r\nwrought into tables, fireplaces, and many other ornamental forms;\r\nand although the farmers had made fences of it for 150 years, no\r\none suspected what it was till the study of mineralogy, in Yale\r\nCollege, brought it to light.\r\n\r\n[10] See Tilloch's Phil.

I. _Remarks on the Geology and Mineralogy of a Section of\r\nMassachusetts on Connecticut River, with a Part of New-Hampshire\r\nand Vermont; by_ EDWARD HITCHCOCK, A. M. _Principal of Deerfield\r\nAcademy_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe geology of this tract, from a few miles south of Northampton in\r\nMassachusetts, to the north boundary of Brattleborough in Vermont,\r\nand of Chesterfield in New-Hampshire, is shown on the subjoined\r\nmap. The primitive formation, except the argillite, is coloured\r\nvermilion; the secondary, blue; and the alluvial, gamboge yellow,\r\naccording to Cleaveland. The alluvial part is elevated above\r\nthe bed of Connecticut river from 10 to 100 feet, and, in most\r\nplaces, reposes on red sandstone. The soil in the northern part is\r\ngenerally argillaceous; but in the southern more siliceous. The\r\nsecondary formation consists chiefly of detached eminences that\r\nrise abruptly from the plain, and are composed of red sandstone and\r\npuddingstone alternating, except the elevations A and B, (Holyoke\r\nand Tom) and a part of the range CD, passing through Deerfield\r\nand Greenfield, which are greenstone. The part coloured rose-red\r\nconsists of argillite, sometimes alternating with mica slate,\r\nsiliceous slate, or chlorite slate. It is thus coloured to show\r\nthe extent of the argillite, and not from a belief that this rock\r\nis of the transition class; for in this region the argillite is\r\nundoubtedly primitive. Some quarries of this rock have been opened\r\nin Massachusetts; and in Vermont are extensively wrought. I have\r\nnot learnt how far the argillite extends northward in Vermont and\r\nNew-Hampshire. Its strata are almost perpendicular, inclining a few\r\ndegrees to the west.\r\n\r\nThe primitive region on the west side of Connecticut river,\r\nincluded by the map, is made up of mica slate, as a prevailing\r\nrock, particularly in the northern part. Hornblende slate sometimes\r\nalternates with this, and sienite appears in various places, though\r\nits strata are generally thin. Limestone also occurs in Deerfield,\r\nConway, Colrain, &c. of a dull brown colour. It contains so large\r\na proportion of silex that it is often but little removed from\r\ngranular quartz. Lime for building has sometimes been obtained from\r\nit. A range of granite, containing veins of lead ore, appears at\r\nSouthampton, and proceeds to Hatfield. North of this, the other\r\nrocks cover it, and it does not again rise within the limits of the\r\nmap.\r\n\r\nSienite is the prevailing rock on the east side of Connecticut\r\nriver in the primitive region, more particularly in the southern\r\npart. In some places a narrow stratum of mica slate lies next\r\nto the conglomerate of the secondary formation, and a low range\r\nof graphic and common granite has been observed in Amherst and\r\nLeverett, lying next to the mica slate. Other veins of granite\r\nalso traverse the sienite; and gneiss occurs in many places. The\r\nproportion of hornblende in the sienite is generally small, and\r\nmica is often present in considerable proportion. Porphyritic\r\nsienite is common in this quarter, and steatite occurs in its\r\neastern part.\r\n\r\nMost of the primitive region on the map is broken and mountainous,\r\nbeing made up of parallel ridges and detached eminences. The\r\nstrata run nearly north and south, and dip to the east at angles\r\nbetween 20° and 60°. It would be easy to extend the map on the\r\nwest to the top of Hoosack mountain, since the country is all\r\nprimitive; and on the east the primitive continues, with a few\r\nexceptions, to the ocean. The map might also be extended to the\r\nboundary of Connecticut, by prolonging the primitive ranges with\r\nsome divergency, and colouring the intermediate space secondary,\r\nexcept a narrow tract on the east side of Connecticut river, which\r\nis alluvial. These extensions were not thought necessary.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Gill, at E, there is a cataract in Connecticut\r\nriver, from 30 to 40 feet in height; and it is believed that\r\nthe alluvial region, and part of the secondary shown on the map\r\nfrom this fall to the place where the river passes between mount\r\nHolyoke and Tom, was formerly the bed of a lake: for the logs are\r\nstill found undecayed in many places, from 10 to 20 feet below the\r\nsurface; the river has evidently worn a passage between Holyoke and\r\nTom: many of the hills on the northern part, and the sandstone on\r\nthe plain, bear the marks of having been washed by water, and the\r\nchannels of two rivers are still visible in Deerfield, the one 30,\r\nand the other 100 feet above the present bed of Connecticut river.\r\nBetween mount Tom and the mountains west, there is a secondary\r\nplain of sufficient height to throw back the water over the\r\nsupposed bed of the lake, before a passage was worn between Holyoke\r\nand Tom. South of these hills commences another alluvial and\r\nsecondary tract, extending on both sides of the river to Haddam, in\r\nConnecticut, where the river passes between mountains, and perhaps\r\nthis region also was the bed of a lake.\r\n\r\nThe plain on which the village of Deerfield stands, with the\r\nadjoining meadows, is sunk 50 or 60 feet below the general alluvial\r\ntract, and was undoubtedly the bed of a pond, or small lake, that\r\nremained after the larger one of which we have spoken had subsided.\r\nWhen this larger lake decreased, Deerfield river was cut off from\r\na communication with the Connecticut by the mountain CD, and the\r\nplain extending westward from this mountain. There is a tradition,\r\nderived from the aboriginals of Deerfield, that the passage in\r\nwhich Deerfield river now runs through the mountain CD, was begun\r\nby a squaw with a clam-shell.\r\n\r\nOn the margin of these meadows, at considerable elevation,\r\nnumerous small conical excavations appear. On digging below the\r\nsurface, stones are found calcined by fire. These are probably the\r\nspots where Indian wigwams formerly stood. Many vestiges of the\r\naboriginals are frequently found in Deerfield, such as beads, stone\r\npots, mortars, pipes, axes, and the barbs of arrows and pikes. Near\r\nthe village they had a burial-ground, where many skeletons have\r\nbeen uncovered. A roll of human hair was lately found here, by Mr.\r\nJ. C. Hoyt of Deerfield, three-fourths of an inch in diameter, and\r\nthree inches long, closely tied by a string made of the hide of\r\nsome animal, which string was encircled by brass or copper clasps\r\ngreatly oxidized; but the hair and string were in a good state of\r\npreservation, though they must have lain there more than a century.\r\nIn the meadows, logs, leaves, butternuts, and walnuts are found\r\nundecayed, 15 feet below the surface; and stumps of trees have been\r\nobserved at that depth standing yet firmly where they once grew.\r\nIn the same meadows, a few years since, several toads were dug up\r\nfrom 15 feet below the surface, and three feet in gravel. They soon\r\nrecovered from a torpid state, and hopped away.\r\n\r\nThe small range of hills beginning at the south line of\r\nDeerfield, and terminating in Gill, deserves description. At its\r\ncommencement on the south, a conical hill, called Sugar Loaf,\r\nof red conglomerate, rises abruptly from the plain 500 feet.\r\nThe appearance of this hill, as you come from the south, is\r\npicturesque, and it is an interesting feature of the country.\r\nThe range becomes higher for three miles, where, at its greatest\r\nelevation, it is 730 feet above the bed of Deerfield river. The\r\nwest side of the mountain is precipitous, and in some places naked.\r\nThe ascent on the other side is gentle.\r\n\r\nBoth sides of this hill are sandstone and puddingstone, frequently\r\nalternating: though these are most extensive on the west side, and\r\nas we rise the puddingstone predominates. The strata dip to the\r\neast about 10 degrees. Near the centre of this range is a ridge of\r\ngreenstone, with a mural face on the west, and amorphous masses\r\nlying at the base, half way up to its summit. This ridge does\r\nnot rise so high as the puddingstone on the west of it, as may be\r\nseen in the view of strata with the map. It commences on the west\r\nbank of Connecticut river, about a mile north of the hill C, and\r\nincreases in elevation nearly to the spot where it disappears at\r\nthe fall of the river in Gill. This rock does not appear to rest on\r\nsandstone, but to descend through it, where there is an opportunity\r\nfor observation. Deerfield river has worn a passage through the\r\nsandstone and greenstone 150 feet deep, and the greenstone passes\r\nunder its bed, and the sandstone, at a few rods distant lies on\r\neach side of the greenstone. A similar fact has been noticed at\r\nthe fall in Connecticut river, in Gill. Yet I have coloured this\r\ngreenstone secondary on the map; for it is certain that Mount Tom\r\nrests on sandstone, and it is stated by Professor Silliman, that\r\nthe same rock does in Connecticut. Could we penetrate deeper below\r\nthe surface, it is probable the same would be found to be the case\r\nwith this greenstone.\r\n\r\nAs stated above, this rock disappears near the cataract in Gill,\r\nand it is succeeded by puddingstone. But four miles farther north,\r\nit again emerges in Bernardstone, though it rises but little above\r\nthe surface. Here its character is changed. The hornblende is\r\nmore crystalline, and the rock becomes decidedly primitive, as\r\nyou approach a mountain of argillite and mica slate, into which\r\nit passes, and no greenstone has been observed north of this. It\r\nterminates not far from the line of Vermont. The red sandstone and\r\nconglomerate also terminate on the opposite side of the river in\r\nNorthfield.\r\n\r\nThe greenstone in the above described range, is of a finer texture\r\nthan the same rock in Connecticut; and the feldspar, in some\r\nspecimens, is scarcely discernible with a microscope. Indeed, in\r\nmany instances, the eye would decide the rock to be basalt. Much\r\nof it is fissile, the laminæ varying from half an inch to a foot\r\nin thickness. This is most perceptible among the loose masses;\r\nbut it exists also in that in place. Whether this circumstance be\r\naccidental, I will not attempt to decide.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of the greenstone of our vicinity constitutes\r\nthe base of amygdaloid. The imbedded substances are calcareous\r\nspar, quartz, chalcedony, analcime, prehnite, &c. as will be\r\nmore particularly mentioned hereafter. Globular concretions of\r\ngreenstone are common in this amygdaloid, several inches in\r\ndiameter, and of greater specific gravity than the other parts\r\nof the rock. A great number of columns occur in the same range,\r\nhaving from three to six sides. Some of them are quite regular,\r\nand are well articulated, exhibiting at their joints considerable\r\nconcavities and convexities. They are from one to thirty feet long,\r\nand, in their natural position, incline a few degrees to the east,\r\nas may be seen in the view of strata with the map; A few have been\r\nnoticed that make lateral curves. One of these hexagonal columns\r\nmeasures at one end as follows:--Diagonals, 27, 29, and 29½ inches;\r\nsides, 16½, 13¼, 11½, 17, 11½, and 16½ inches. The convexity of\r\nthis column is a little more than an inch. The best instances of\r\nthese prisms occur one mile east from the village of Deerfield.\r\n\r\nMasses of greenstone are found at considerable distance from the\r\nrange, among the puddingstone. One has been noticed weighing\r\nmany tons, a hundred rods from the range of greenstone, and on\r\nmuch higher ground. Some of these scattered fragments contain\r\nchalcedony. A specimen of petrosiliceous porphyry has been found\r\namong the same puddingstone, and also a mass of singular, though\r\nnot well defined, amygdaloid, whose base is similar to wacke, and\r\nimbedded substances are calcareous spar, chlorite, and green earth.\r\n\r\nThe elevation in the north part of Sunderland, called Toby, from\r\n800 to 900 feet high, is chiefly conglomerate, red, brown, or\r\ngreenish, which, in some parts, alternates with chlorite slate,\r\nsecondary argillite, and a sandstone that seems to be passing into\r\ngray wacke slate. Some of the imbedded masses in this puddingstone\r\nare quite large, its cement is frequently calcareous, its aspect\r\nis singular, and it is very different from the puddingstone before\r\ndescribed, On the opposite side of the river. At the foot of this\r\nmountain, in the bottom of Connecticut river, distinct impressions\r\nof fish are found on a schistose rock, like the one above mentioned\r\nas passing into gray wacke slate. This same species of slate occurs\r\nin several other places at the bottom of Connecticut river, as at\r\nthe fall in Gill. In this last place bituminous shale has been\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nIn Mount Toby, in Sunderland, is a cave nearly 150 feet above the\r\nbed of Connecticut river. It opens to the north and west, forming\r\na quarter of a circle, is 130 feet in extent, 60 feet deep, and\r\nfrom 3 to 20 wide. A little to the south of it, is a fissure in\r\nthe puddingstone, formed by a separation of the rock, ten feet\r\nwide, and as deep as the cave. So perfect is this division, that it\r\nappears as if cloven down by the sword of some Titan. Perhaps this\r\ncave and fissure were formed by the washing of the waters of the\r\nlake we have mentioned on the sandstone and conglomerate beneath;\r\nthus causing the superincumbent rock to fall and separate. There\r\nis no appearance of any other convulsion. Imperfect, calcareous\r\nstalactites are found in this cave.\r\n\r\nThe falls in Connecticut river, at E, are not unworthy of notice.\r\nThe river here is about 40 rods wide, and the height of the main\r\ncataract, raised considerably by an artificial dam, is 30 feet. The\r\nfall continues two miles. On the north bank you view the cataract\r\nfrom elevated ground, and can see the river nearly a mile above\r\nand below--above, perfectly smooth and calm, below, forming a\r\nquarter of a circle, and tumbling among the broken rocks. On the\r\nopposite side of the river are a few buildings, the commencement\r\nof a canal, and, behind these, moderately elevated hills, covered\r\nwith woods. Two rocky islands near the middle of the descending\r\nsheet, and another thirty rods below, add much to the beauty of the\r\nview. Looking from the southeast shore, you have a partial prospect\r\nof the falls, and a view of an amphitheatre of greenstone hills,\r\nthrough which a small river empties. The pleasure derived from the\r\nview proceeds more from its wildness than its sublimity.\r\n\r\nThe position of the hills, boundaries, and rivers, on the\r\naccompanying map, may not, in all cases, be precisely correct. The\r\ngeneral outlines were enlarged by a pentegraph from Carleton's\r\nmap of Massachusetts, and the intermediate objects were placed\r\nchiefly by the eye; their relative situations being determined\r\nby travelling over the ground, and viewing them from different\r\nelevations. The boundaries of the several formations have not been\r\nso carefully noticed near the angles of the map as in the central\r\nparts. Of their correctness generally, however, I am confident. The\r\nlatitude and longitude of Deerfield, from which those on the map\r\nwere marked, were obtained by taking a mean of the observations\r\ngiven by Gen. E. Hoyt, in the Transactions of the American Academy\r\nof Arts and Sciences, and of twelve lunar observations since made.\r\nThe result is, Lat. 42° 32' 32\". Long. 72° 39' from Greenwich.\r\n\r\nWith the map is given a view of the strata of rocks from Hoosack\r\nmountain to eleven miles east of Connecticut river, on a line\r\nnearly east and west, passing through Deerfield. The horizontal\r\ndistances are laid down from a scale: the elevations are assumed.\r\nThe principal rocks only are coloured; for it is very difficult\r\nto determine the breadth of many, since they frequently alternate\r\nwith one another. I have not examined the country on the east side\r\nof Connecticut river with sufficient care to be able to extend the\r\nsection on that side more than a few miles.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to mention, that Mount Holyoke, so much\r\ncelebrated for the delightful view from its top, has been found,\r\nwith a sextant, to be 830 feet above Connecticut river. Its height\r\nhas been frequently overrated.\r\n\r\nThe mineralogy of this section of the country has been but\r\nimperfectly explored. I shall mention those minerals only of which\r\nI have obtained specimens, and whose localities have not been\r\nnoticed by mineralogists.\r\n\r\n_Quartz_--several varieties.\r\n\r\n  1. _Rock Crystal_--abundant. Some good specimens are found\r\n  in Conway, on feldspar, with the usual hexagonal, prismatic\r\n  crystals, and these crystals cross each other in all directions.\r\n\r\n  2. _Irised Quartz_--found in Leyden.\r\n\r\n  3. _Granular Quartz_--in Deerfield.\r\n\r\n  4. _Radiated Quartz_--in Whately and Shelburne.\r\n\r\n  5. _Blue Quartz_--in rolled masses on the banks of Deerfield\r\n  river.\r\n\r\n  6. _Greasy Quartz_--in same place.\r\n\r\n  7. _Pseudomorphous Quartz_--in greenstone, Deerfield.\r\n\r\n  8. _Lamellar Quartz_--in same place. The laminæ sometimes\r\n  penetrate crystals of common quartz.\r\n\r\n  9. _Tubular_, or _Pectinated Quartz_--in same place.\r\n\r\n  10. _Quartz Geodes_--in same place.\r\n\r\n_Prase_--in the north part of Sunderland. (Not good specimens.)\r\n\r\n_Amethyst_--in Greenstone, Deerfield: the colour is not deep, but\r\ndelicate.\r\n\r\n_Chalcedony_--in same place--considerably abundant, but generally\r\nin small masses.\r\n\r\n_Carnelian_--in same place, not plenty. The chalcedony, in some\r\nspecimens, seems to be passing into cacholong, and the carnelian\r\ninto sardonyx.\r\n\r\n_Agate_--in same place. It is made up of chalcedony, carnelian, and\r\nquartz. They are generally small, but some are elegant.\r\n\r\n_Jasper_, red, and yellow--found in rolled masses on the banks of\r\nDeerfield river and in Leyden. Some have been found imperfectly\r\nstriped. It occurs frequently as it was formed by the aboriginals\r\ninto barbs for pikes and arrows.\r\n\r\n_Petrosilex_--on the banks of Deerfield river--not good specimens.\r\n\r\n_Feldspar_--the red variety occurs in puddingstone, Deerfield. It\r\nis not necessary to mention any other locality of a mineral so\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\n_Hornblende_--very abundant--mostly black in this vicinity.\r\n\r\n_Mica_--this is very abundant on the east side of Connecticut\r\nriver. Some crystals of it have been found in Amherst.\r\n\r\n_Talc_--in Shutesbury.\r\n\r\n_Steatite._ The localities of this are seen on the section. The\r\naboriginals formed many articles from this mineral, as pots, pipes,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\n_Chlorite_--in Shutesbury: also in amygdaloid, Deerfield. In\r\nDeerfield academy there are some Indian pipes of this mineral, well\r\nwrought.\r\n\r\n_Green Earth_--in small quantities, in amygdaloid, Deerfield.\r\n\r\n_Schorl_--the black variety occurs in Pelham, Shutesbury, and\r\nOrange, Mass., and in Brattleborough, Vermont.\r\n\r\n_Epidote_--in Deerfield, Shutesbury, Leyden, and Pelham, and in\r\nAthol, Worcester county. The specimens poor.\r\n\r\n_Tremolite_--in the west part of Leyden, near Green river. The rock\r\nin this region is chiefly mica slate, and the quantity of tremolite\r\nis very great. Tons of it might be easily collected.\r\n\r\n_Cyanite_, or _Sappare_--in Deerfield, in mica slate; discovered by\r\nDr. S. W. Williams.\r\n\r\n_Actynolite_--rare, found in Shutesbury.\r\n\r\n_Serpentine_--found in Leyden in rolled masses. Some of the\r\nspecimens admit a fine polish, and the ground is handsomely\r\nvariegated. It has not been noticed _in situ_.\r\n\r\n_Asbestus_--compact, in Pelham.\r\n\r\n_Garnets_--very plenty in Conway, Deerfield, Shelburne, &c. Good\r\nspecimens of the melanite occur in Conway.\r\n\r\n_Native Alum_--in Leyden, in small quantities, efflorescing on\r\nargillaceous slate.\r\n\r\n_Sulphur_--in Conway, Shelburne, and Warwick, efflorescing on mica\r\nslate.\r\n\r\n_Prehnite_--in greenstone, Deerfield, encrusting the columns and in\r\nradiated masses, but rarely crystallized. The veins of it, when in\r\nplace, are nearly perpendicular.\r\n\r\n_Zeolite_--in same place, not abundant. Some good specimens of the\r\nradiated variety are found.\r\n\r\n_Chabasie_--in same place, considerably abundant. No crystals have\r\nyet been found whose sides exceed a quarter of an inch. It occurs\r\nin the veins of the greenstone, in geodes, on balls of zeolite, on\r\nchalcedony, on lamellar quartz, &c.\r\n\r\n_Stilbite_--in same place, not abundant. It is commonly associated\r\nwith chabasie, and the crystals, though small, are well defined.\r\n\r\n_Analcime_--in same place, very abundant, and is associated with\r\nquartz and amethyst, which are sometimes enclosed by analcime. It\r\ngenerally occurs in cylindrical, reniform, and radiated masses. A\r\nfew perfect crystals only have been observed.\r\n\r\n_Laminated Calcareous Spar_--in the same place, not uncommon.\r\n\r\nChalcedony, carnelian, agate, amethyst, prehnite, zeolite,\r\nchabasie, stilbite, and analcime, have been found nearly in the\r\nsame place; and it may not be amiss to observe, that this spot is\r\ndistant from Deerfield Academy about one mile, and bears from the\r\nsame, by a true meridian, E. 2°, 15′ S.\r\n\r\n_Iron Sand_--found in considerable quantity near the falls in\r\nConnecticut river, on the Montague shore.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Iron_--in Conway, in small quantities, efflorescing on\r\nmica slate.\r\n\r\n_Sulphuret of Iron_--in Halifax, Vermont, in abundance; also in\r\nCharlemont, Mass., Deerfield, &c.\r\n\r\n_Magnetic Oxide of Iron_--very common in the region west of\r\nConnecticut river. I have observed it in Athol, Worcester county.\r\n\r\n_Specular Oxide of Iron_--some veins of this ore occur in Hawley,\r\nBernardstown, and Warwick, and have been wrought to a small extent.\r\n\r\n_Micaceous Oxide of Iron_--in the iron mine in Hawley.\r\n\r\n_Green Carbonate of Copper_--in greenstone, in Greenfield. This\r\nore constitutes a vein on the bank of Connecticut river, passing\r\ninto the hill on one side, and under the river on the other. It has\r\nnever been wrought, nor, indeed, is its locality publicly known.\r\n\r\n_Copper Pyrites_--in the same vein, not abundant, at the surface.\r\n\r\n_Sulphate of Barytes_--in the same place, constituting the\r\nimmediate walls of the vein. Its breadth on the wall varies from an\r\ninch to a foot, and the breadth of the vein is 6 or 8 feet.\r\n\r\n_Galena_--in Whately. This is probably from a continuation of the\r\nvein of this ore that appears at Montgomery, Southampton, and\r\nHatfield. A single crystal has been found in the same range, in\r\nGreenfield, twelve miles north of Whately; but it was not in place.\r\n\r\n_Red Oxyde of Titanium_--in Leyden, crystallized on quartz and\r\ntremolite, chiefly on the latter; colour brownish red--specific\r\ngravity 4.232; scratches glass, handsomely geniculated, and\r\nsometimes several geniculations in the same specimen; in one as\r\nmany as six could be perceived.\r\n\r\n_Eagle Stone_, or _Nodular argillaceous Oxide of Iron_--one\r\nspecimen on the banks of Deerfield river.\r\n\r\n_Rose-red Quartz_--a loose mass in alluvial soil, Deerfield.\r\n\r\n_Red Oxide of Titanium_--in Shelburne.\r\n\r\nI would acknowledge my peculiar obligations to Professor Silliman,\r\nof New-Haven, and to Dr. David Hunt, of Northampton, Mass. for\r\nthe very generous assistance they have given me in a commencement\r\nof the study of mineralogy, and for their liberal aid in this\r\nparticular communication. Their kindness, it is believed, will\r\nnot soon be forgotten. To several others, also, I am indebted for\r\ncommunicating facts of importance.\r\n\r\n_Deerfield, October, 1817._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. II. _On the Prairies and Barrens of the West, by_ CALEB\r\nATWATER, ESQ. _in Letters to the Editor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CIRCLEVILLE, Ohio, May 28, 1818.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Sir_,\r\n\r\nI send you for publication in the Journal of Science, an Essay on\r\nthe Prairies and Barrens found in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Description of the Prairies._\r\n\r\n_Prairie_ is a French word, signifying a meadow, but is here\r\napplied only to natural meadows. They are found in all the states\r\nand territories west of the Allegany mountains, more or less\r\nnumerous, of greater or less extent. They are covered with a\r\ncoarse kind of grass, which, before the country is settled in\r\ntheir vicinity, grows to the height of six or seven feet. After\r\nthese natural meadows are fed upon by domestic animals, the grass\r\ndoes not grow to a greater height than it does in common pastures.\r\nSometimes this grass is intermixed with weeds and plum-bushes.\r\nSome of those prairies are dry, while others are moist. Pickaway\r\nPlains, in Pickaway county, in the State of Ohio, lying a small\r\ndistance south of this place, are nearly seven miles in length, and\r\nabout three miles in width, on ground considerably elevated above\r\nthe Scioto river, almost perfectly level, and, in their native\r\nstate, were covered with a great quantity of grass, some weeds and\r\nplum-bushes; and in the most elevated places, there were a few\r\ntrees. This was one great prairie.\r\n\r\nSandusky Plains, lying on the high ground between the head waters\r\nof the Whetstone branch of the Scioto river, and the waters of\r\nstreams running into Lake Erie, are still more extensive than\r\nthose of Pickaway, covered with a coarse, tall grass, intermixed\r\nwith weeds, with here and there a tree, presenting to the eye a\r\nlandscape of great extent.\r\n\r\nThe moist prairies generally lie along some stream, or at the head\r\nof one, on level land, or on that which gently descends. The moist\r\nprairies are too wet for trees to grow on them; and whether moist\r\nor dry, the soil, for a greater or less depth, is always alluvial,\r\nresting on pebbles and sand, such as are found at the bottom of\r\nrivers, ponds, and lakes. In some instances, the writer is credibly\r\ninformed, that the shells of muscles are found imbedded in the\r\npebbles and sand. That these shells, such as abound in our rivers,\r\nponds, and lakes, should be found in low prairies along the banks\r\nof waters which frequently overflow them, excites no wonder, nor\r\neven surprise; but that these shells should be found thus imbedded\r\nin pebbles and sand underneath several feet of alluvial soil, in\r\nsituations more than one hundred feet above the waters of any\r\nstream now in existence, is calculated to perplex the mind of the\r\nsuperficial observer. These prairies are found in the western half\r\nof the State of Ohio, and north of the hills adjacent to the river\r\nof that name. They are also found in every state and territory west\r\nof the Alleganies, from the great northern lakes on the north,\r\nto the Mexican Gulf on the south; from the western foot of the\r\nAllegany mountains, to the eastern one of the Rocky mountains, up\r\nthe Missouri. In summer, the grass which spontaneously covers them,\r\nfeeds immense herds of cattle; in winter, the hay that is cut on\r\nthem, with a little Indian corn or maize, feeds and fattens the\r\nsame herds. Some of these prairies extend as far as the eye can\r\nreach; others contain only a few perches of ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Description of the Barrens._\r\n\r\nBut besides these prairies, there are also extensive tracts of\r\ncountry in this part of the Union which deserve and shall receive\r\nour notice; they are called \"_Barrens_.\" From their appellation,\r\n\"barrens,\" the person unacquainted with them is not to suppose\r\nthem thus called from their sterility, because most of them are\r\nquite the reverse. These barrens are found in a level country,\r\nwith here and there a gentle rise, only a few feet higher than the\r\nland around it. On these little rises, for they are not hills,\r\ntrees grow, and grass also; but grass and weeds are the only\r\noccupants of the soil where there is no rise of ground. The soil\r\nis alluvial to greater or less depth in these barrens, though on\r\nsome of the highest rises there is little or none; the lower the\r\nground the deeper the alluvion. On these gentle rises, where there\r\nis no alluvion, we find stiff, blue clay, and no pebbles. Under\r\nthe alluvial black soil, in the lower grounds, we find pebbles\r\nsimilar to those in the prairies, owing to similar causes. On the\r\nlittle ridges, wherever the land is not too moist, the oak or the\r\nhickory has taken possession, and there grows to a moderate height,\r\nin clusters. It would seem, that whenever the land had become\r\nsufficiently dry for an acorn or a hickory-nut to sprout, take\r\nroot, and grow, it did so; and from one or more of these trees,\r\nin time, others have grown around them in such clusters as we\r\nnow behold. Where the land is lower, the soil deeper, more moist\r\nand more fertile, the grass was too thick, and the soil too wet,\r\nfor such kind of trees to grow in as were found in the immediate\r\nvicinity. Imagine, then, natural meadows, of various dimensions,\r\nand of every figure which the imagination can conceive, with here\r\nand there a gentle rise of ground, decked with a few scattering\r\ntrees or a thick cluster of them, and bearing a tall, coarse\r\ngrass, which is thin on the rises, but on the lower grounds thick\r\nand luxuriant; imagine, also, a rill of a reddish colour scarcely\r\nmeandering through ground a little lower than the surrounding\r\nplain, and you will have a very correct idea of the appearance of\r\nthese barrens. They are _generally_ (not always) found on what,\r\nin our western dialect, is called _second bottom_, and not on a\r\nlevel with any streams of magnitude, but rather at their sources.\r\nTo mention all the counties of this State where these prairies and\r\nbarrens are found, would be too tedious, and illy comport with the\r\nobject which we have in view. We shall therefore content ourselves\r\nwith describing those found in the north half of Fayette county,\r\nand the adjoining county of Madison, which may be said to be almost\r\nentirely one great barren of more than forty miles extent from\r\nnorth to south, and generally half as much in breadth from east to\r\nwest. The great barren in Fayette, Madison, and, we may add, in\r\nthe counties still north of them, is on land elevated from fifty\r\nto one hundred feet above the level of the Scioto river, into\r\nwhich the streams that have their sources in this tract of country\r\ngenerally run. This land lies so level that the waters stand on it\r\ntoo long for grain to thrive equally with grass, unless, indeed,\r\nthe farmer should dig a long drain, which is easily effected by the\r\nplough, with a little assistance from the hoe and the spade. But as\r\nnature seems to have intended this tract of country for the raising\r\nof cattle instead of grain, the husbandman has listened to the\r\nsuggestion, and in this great barren are found some thousands of\r\nthe finest cattle which the State affords. Here the horse, the ox,\r\nand the swine feed, thrive, and fatten with little expense to their\r\nowner; but sheep do not, and never will, thrive on prairie grass,\r\nor wet grounds. Fruit-trees, the peach, the apple, the plum, &c.\r\ndo very well when planted on the gently rising grounds, where the\r\nhickory or the oak had once stood. Fruit-trees, such as have been\r\nnamed, thrive very well also on the dry prairies. On the eastern\r\nside of the Allegany mountains there neither is, nor was there\r\never, any thing like these prairies and barrens, if we except those\r\nfound in the western part of New-York, in the Genesee country, and\r\nin the vicinity of the lakes in that quarter. These, the writer of\r\nthis saw nearly thirty years since, and before that country was\r\nmuch settled. Those prairies were similar in appearance to ours in\r\nthe west, and were, beyond doubt, formed by similar means.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Speculations on the Origin of the Prairies and Barrens._\r\n\r\nWhat were the causes which contribute to form these natural\r\nmeadows? That water was the principal agent in their formation, we\r\nvery little doubt; but this is not the common opinion. According\r\nto that opinion, our prairies and barrens, and especially the\r\nlatter, were occasioned entirely by the burning of the woods by the\r\nIndians, in order to take the wild game. Let us try this opinion by\r\nthe indubitable appearances exhibited by these prairies and barrens.\r\n\r\nThey are invariably found in a level country, or in one which is\r\nnearly so; and the soil is generally, if not always, more moist\r\nthan that which is uneven and hilly. Would not the leaves, where\r\nthe land is dry, burn over with as great facility, or even with\r\ngreater facility, than the grass would where the land is wet? Would\r\nthere not be more wild game where they could find their food in\r\nplenty, such as acorns and hickory nuts, on which they feed in\r\nwinter, than on land where no food, except dry grass and weeds,\r\nwere to be found? It is well known that these prairies and barrens\r\ncould not be burnt over when the vegetable productions which cover\r\nthem were growing. At the only season when it is possible to burn\r\nthem, that is in winter, to what kind of regions do the wild\r\nanimals resort? Is it not to the thick woods? Every hunter will\r\nanswer in the affirmative. For the space of twenty-five years,\r\nthe writer of this lived in the vicinity of Indians, and from\r\ninformation on which he relies, as well as from his own actual\r\nobservation, he confidently avers that the Indians neither are,\r\nnor ever were, in the habit of firing the woods in order to take\r\ngame. Erroneous information first propagated such an opinion,\r\nand blind credulity has extended it down to us. Another opinion,\r\nequally groundless, prevails to a considerable extent; and that\r\nis, that these prairies have all been heretofore cultivated by the\r\naborigines, and that the grass having overspread these plains,\r\nprevented the growth of trees on them. The Indians, it is to be\r\npresumed, never cultivated any other grain than maize, or Indian\r\ncorn, and yet we see few or no corn-hills in any part of this\r\ncountry. In the western part of New-York, before it was settled by\r\nits present inhabitants, thousands and thousands of acres were to\r\nbe seen, where the trees were as large as any in the forest, and\r\nyet the rows of corn-hills were plainly discernible. I refer in a\r\nparticular manner to what is now called Cayuga county. There the\r\ngrowth of grass had not prevented the growth of trees, nor did it\r\nhere. We know that some of these prairies were cultivated by the\r\nIndians, but never to any very considerable extent. This country\r\nnever was thickly settled by Indians, like the shores of the\r\nAtlantic and the banks of the rivers running into it. No, it was\r\nthe ancestors of the Peruvians and the Mexicans who lived here in\r\ngreat numbers, before they migrated to South America.\r\n\r\nThe question then recurs, by what powerful means were these\r\nprairies and barrens formed?\r\n\r\nThat water was the principal agent, we infer from the fact, that\r\nthe soil is always alluvial to greater or less depth; the former we\r\ncall prairie, the latter barren. But how could the country from the\r\nsouthern shore of Lake Erie to Chillicothe, a distance of more than\r\none hundred and fifty miles from north to south, ever be covered\r\nwith water long enough to form alluvial soil, in many places from\r\nfour to six feet in depth? I answer, that the Niagara river, the\r\npresent outlet of Lake Erie, has worn away several hundred feet,\r\nand in that way the lake is lowered in the same proportion. The\r\nhigh land, composed entirely of sand, originally extending from the\r\nOhio northerly upwards of forty miles, to Chillicothe, has been\r\nworn through by the Scioto river; and the waters which once for\r\nages covered the whole country north of the hills along the Ohio\r\nriver have been drained off, and the dry land appears where once\r\nstood the waters of lakes Erie and Michigan, then forming but one\r\ngreat lake. I am fully impressed with the belief, that were the\r\nbottom of Niagara river as high as it once was, the upper lakes\r\nwould now, as formerly, empty themselves into the Ohio by the\r\nScioto and Miami rivers, and into the Mississippi by the Illinois.\r\nI might proceed to examine every part of the country where prairies\r\nand barrens are found; but they have all been formed by the same\r\nagent, and that is water. An objection to this opinion may be\r\nraised by some, that these prairies and barrens are frequently\r\nfound in the counties of Delaware, Champaign, Madison, Fayette,\r\n&c. on ground considerably elevated. Are they higher than the\r\nhills near Chillicothe? From a careful inspection, but without any\r\ninstruments, I am convinced that they are none of them as high.\r\n\r\nThere is no perpendicular fall of water, but merely a gradual\r\ndescent, from Columbus to the Ohio; nay, there is no fall from the\r\nvery source of the Scioto to its mouth. Every one acquainted with\r\nhydrostatics, knows that water will run briskly where the descent\r\nis only a few inches in a mile. The writer believes that the\r\nScioto, from its source to the Ohio river, does not descend more\r\nthan one hundred feet, and that the present surface of Lake Erie\r\nis about on a level with the Ohio in a freshet; that before the\r\nchannel of Niagara river was deepened, as it evidently has been, by\r\nthe attrition of that mighty stream; and before the hills adjacent\r\nto the Ohio were worn down by the waters of the Scioto, the whole\r\ncountry north of Chillicothe, where these hills commence, to Lake\r\nErie inclusive, was covered with water, except the very highest\r\nhills in the counties of Greene, &c. which were then islands. What\r\ntends to corroborate this opinion is, that on these high grounds we\r\nfind limestone and other rocks, and indications of gypsum; but no\r\nalluvion, and none of those fragments and ruins which are produced\r\nby water acting mechanically upon a country for a long space of\r\ntime. We might mention other parts of country where prairies and\r\nbarrens abound, and which have been formed by water. Those along\r\nGreene river, in Kentucky, have evidently been covered by the\r\nwaters of that river. The bed of that stream has been deepened by\r\nthe constant flowing of the water along its channel; the water is\r\ndrained off, and the prairies and barrens now occupy the soil which\r\nthe water had made and formerly covered. The prairies above the\r\nfalls of Hockhocking, along that river, have evidently been formed\r\nin the same way, and owe their origin and appearances to similar\r\ncauses. There is near Lancaster, on the last-mentioned river in the\r\nState of Ohio, and near the great road, a gentle rise of ground in\r\nthe prairie, which has every appearance of having been an island,\r\nand is so called by the people of the vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn fine, wherever prairies and barrens are found, there, for a\r\nlong space of time, water once stood, but was gradually drained\r\noff. Else why alluvial soil to such a depth, in low situations,\r\nand growing thinner as we ascend on ground more elevated? Else why\r\ndo we find rocks in more elevated tracts of country, and not in\r\nprairies or barrens? Else why do we find no alluvion, no grass, but\r\na thick growth of ancient forest-trees on the higher lands? Else\r\nwhy do we find beneath the alluvion of the prairies, pebbles and\r\nshells similar to those at the bottom of lakes and ponds? Else why\r\ndo the higher grounds to this moment present the appearances of\r\nso many islands? And all these indications where no stream now in\r\nexistence could by possibility have reached them?\r\n\r\nThat the waters which once covered so great a part of this State\r\n(Ohio) were drawn off gradually, we infer from the fact, that\r\nthere is not a single indication of the effects of an earthquake\r\nor volcano, from the foot of the Allegany to the banks of the\r\nMississippi: in this region not a stone nor a layer of earth has\r\nbeen misplaced, nor its position changed.\r\n\r\nBut an interesting inquiry here presents itself. Were the hills\r\nalong the Ohio, before they were worn away by the streams which\r\nnow empty themselves into that river, ever high enough to raise\r\nthe water to the north of them to such a degree that it would\r\noverspread the country where the prairies and barrens are now\r\nfound? Although the height of these hills has not been ascertained\r\nby the proper instruments, yet from appearances, not to be mistaken\r\nby any person who examines them and the country towards Lake Erie,\r\nthese hills are much higher than any land between them and that\r\nlake. And from certain indications, (as already remarked,) had not\r\nthe bed of the Niagara been deepened by the running of that mighty\r\nriver, Lake Erie, as formerly, would empty itself into the Ohio by\r\nthe Scioto and Miami; and the great northern lakes would once more\r\ndischarge themselves into the Mississippi by the Illinois. Lake\r\nOntario, from some cause, (possibly an earthquake, or the wearing\r\naway of its outlet, or both,) is considerably lower than it was\r\nformerly: in that way the land along its banks, once covered by its\r\nwaters, is drained, presenting appearances exactly similar to those\r\nseen in many of our prairies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous Remarks on the Prairies and Barrens relative to\r\ntheir Picturesque Features, and to Agriculture and Health, as\r\naffected by the peculiarities of these Tracts._\r\n\r\nTo the traveller, who for several days traverses these prairies\r\nand barrens, their appearance is quite uninviting, and even\r\ndisagreeable. He may travel from morning until night, and make good\r\nspeed, but on looking around him, he fancies himself at the very\r\nspot whence he started. No pleasant variety of hill and dale, no\r\nrapidly running brook delights the eye, and no sound of woodland\r\nmusic strikes the ear; but, in their stead, a dull uniformity of\r\nprospect \"spread out immense.\" Excepting here and there a tree,\r\nor a slight elevation of ground, it is otherwise a dead level,\r\ncovered with tall weeds and coarse grass. The sluggish rivulets, of\r\na reddish colour, scarcely move perceptibly, and their appearance\r\nis as uninviting to the eye, as their taste is disgusting to the\r\npalate. Such are the prairies and barrens of the west; but, in\r\norder to make ample amends for any deficiency, nature has made them\r\nexuberantly fertile. The farmer who settles upon them, by raising\r\ncattle, becomes rich with little labour. He ditches those which\r\nare too moist for grain; he ploughs and fences them, and raises\r\nfrom seventy to one hundred bushels of maize or Indian corn to the\r\nacre, without ever hoeing it. The United States own thousands\r\nand thousands of acres of such land in these western States and\r\nterritories, which, for prompt payment, may be purchased for one\r\ndollar and sixty-two and a half cents an acre. One objection to\r\nthese lands is, the want of timber for fuel and other purposes;\r\nand another is, that they are unhealthy: but in many places there\r\nis an abundance of peat in the wet prairies, and cultivation will\r\nevery year render them more and more healthy. Some of them have\r\nbeen cultivated for fifteen or twenty years past with grain, and\r\nare as fertile as they ever were. As M. Volney says, \"They are the\r\nFlanders of America.\"\r\n\r\n  Yours, &c.      C. A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. III. _Account of the Coal Mines in the vicinity of Richmond,\r\nVirginia, communicated to the editor in a letter from Mr._ JOHN\r\nGRAMMER, _Jun._\r\n\r\n\r\n  PETERSBURGH, _Virg. Jan. 28th, 1818_.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Sir_,\r\n\r\nIn compliance with your request, that I would send you some account\r\nof the Virginia coal pits, I paid a visit to them soon after my\r\nreturn, in company with Mr. R. W. Withers, and I will now proceed\r\nto give you the account proposed.\r\n\r\nThe pits, which we made the particular object of our visit, are\r\nsituated in the county of Chesterfield, about 14 miles distant,\r\nin a direction W. S. W. from Richmond, and 3 miles south of\r\nJames' River. The country rises gradually from Richmond to the\r\npits; and, from its sandy appearance, is evidently an alluvial\r\ndeposit, although its substratum is the granite mentioned by Mr.\r\nM'Clure, as extending through this state from S. S. W. to N.\r\nN. E. The coal is found on the western or upper surface of the\r\ngranite, coincident with it both in direction and inclination;\r\nbut whether they come immediately in contact or not, has not yet\r\nbeen ascertained. The 'bed' of coal is supposed by the miners to\r\nbe coextensive with the granite, and I can discover no very good\r\nreason for disagreeing with them in this particular; but, on the\r\ncontrary, many circumstances concur to strengthen the opinion that\r\nit is really coextensive with the granite. The coal is now procured\r\nfrom at least 25 different pits, opened at convenient distances\r\nthrough an extent of from 50 to 70 miles. It every where commences\r\nat the upper surface or termination of the body of granite. Some\r\nsuppose that it is imposed on the granite; and others, that a thin\r\nstratum of slate is interposed between the coal and granite. It is\r\nalways found covered by the slate. The granite is inclined to the\r\nhorizon at an angle of 45°, and the coal has the same inclination.\r\nAnd since the coal, as far as it has been discovered, is found to\r\naccompany and correspond with the granite, why may we not suppose\r\nthat it continues to accompany the granite, where it has not\r\nyet been discovered? At Heth's pits, the coal is 50 feet thick,\r\nmeasured on a line perpendicular to the surfaces of the extreme\r\nstrata. At some of the pits between Heth's and James' River, it\r\nis 30 feet thick; and at the river, not more than 25 feet. The\r\nthickness of the coal on the north side of James' River, at the\r\npits in Henrico and Hanover counties, is variable, but at no place\r\ngreater than 25 feet; and to the south of Heth's, in the pits\r\nextending to the Appomatox river, it is still less thick. These\r\nfacts would induce the supposition, that the coal was deposited\r\nin a bed, near the centre of which Heth's pits were sunk. But, on\r\nthe other hand, the coal is distinctly stratified, and the number\r\nof strata increases as the coal proceeds from the surface of the\r\nearth; of course, therefore, the farther you proceed from the outer\r\nextremity of the coal, the thicker the body of it will be found;\r\nand from the inclination of the coal, the farther you are from\r\nits outer extremity the deeper it must be under the surface of\r\nthe earth. Heth's pits are 100 feet deeper than any that have yet\r\nbeen sunk; and all the pits, that I have seen, appear to be nearer\r\nto the outer extremity of the coal. We may conclude, therefore,\r\nthat if the others had been sunk as far from the outer extremity,\r\nthey would have been as deep, and the coal would have been found\r\nas thick in them as in Heth's. Heth's pits, now so called, were\r\nfirst opened about 30 years since, and worked to some considerable\r\nextent. Experiencing, however, much inconvenience from the near\r\napproach of the works to a part of the coal which was on fire; and\r\nfinding, from their unskilful mode of mining, that the business\r\nwas not profitable, they abandoned the works, and filled up their\r\nshaft. Some few years after, Mr. Heth obtained possession of the\r\nland; and, having imported two Scotch miners, commenced working\r\nthe coal again. He has now three shafts open, in a line with each\r\nother, in the direction of the vein. They are sunk near the brink\r\nof a steep hill, which rises about 180 feet from the western bank\r\nof a small brook. The depth of one of the shafts is 350 feet.\r\nThe other two are about 300 feet deep, each. A steam-engine,\r\nconstructed by Bolton & Watt, is erected at the middle and deepest\r\nshaft. It is used exclusively for pumping out water; but I will not\r\ntrouble you with an account of the _modus operandi_, as it would\r\nbe only a repetition of your own description of the same operation\r\nat the Cornwall mines. The coal is raised in a box, called by the\r\nminers a _cowe_. These cowes contain about two bushels each, and\r\ntwo of them are alternately rising and descending in each shaft.\r\nThey are raised by means of ropes, fastened to a simple wheel and\r\ncrank, which is turned by mules. In sinking their shafts, they cut,\r\nin the first place, perpendicularly (i. e. to the surface of the\r\nearth) through the coal, to its lower surface; and then turning\r\nwestwardly, they open a horizontal gallery through the inclination\r\nof the vein, to its upper surface; by this means, to use their\r\nown terms, \"gaining a double cut on it.\" Their principal gallery\r\npasses (in the direction of the vein,) by the mouth of each shaft.\r\nIts length is 1350 feet, and it is terminated at each end by a\r\nhitch or dyke of hard sandstone. (The passage was stopped with\r\nrubbish in such a manner as to prevent me from seeing the stone\r\nmyself, and the gentleman who escorted me through the mines is my\r\nauthority for its being sandstone; he might possibly, however,\r\nhave been mistaken, as it is difficult to ascertain what a stone\r\nis, in such a place, until it is broken.) When I was at the pits,\r\nthey were preparing to blast through this rock. At right angles to\r\nthe principal gallery, they have opened, at convenient distances\r\napart, shorter galleries, running westwardly, and these are again\r\nconnected by passages parallel to the first or principal gallery.\r\nPickaxes are the only tools used in working the coal, as it breaks\r\nvery readily, in the direction of the strata. The roofs of some of\r\nthe passages are perfectly smooth; and in such, the light of the\r\nlamps, reflected from the great variety of colours in the coal,\r\npresents a very brilliant sight. The gloomy blackness, however, of\r\nmost of the galleries, and the strange dress and appearance of the\r\nblack miners, would furnish sufficient data to the conception of\r\na poet, for a description of Pluto's kingdom. A strong sulphurous\r\nacid ran down the walls of many of the galleries; and I observed\r\none of the drains was filled with a yellowish gelatinous substance,\r\nwhich I ascertained, on a subsequent examination, was a yellow, or\r\nrather a reddish, oxide of iron, mechanically suspended in water.\r\n\r\nI mentioned above that a part of the coal was on fire: I could not\r\nascertain when this fact was first observed to exist; and it is\r\nnot impossible that the coal may have been burning a century, or\r\nmore. It is highly probable, however, that a comparatively small\r\nquantity of the coal is consumed, as the combustion must be greatly\r\nretarded by the absence of a sufficient portion of atmospheric\r\nair. A strong sulphurous fume issues from an irregular hole in the\r\nside of the hill of about 2 feet diameter. The hole appears to be\r\nonly 4 or 5 feet deep, and the smoke rises into it from cracks,\r\npartly filled with loose clay. The earth is very much cracked\r\naround the hole, to the distance of 12 or 15 feet; and these cracks\r\nare from 1 to 4 inches wide. The mouth of the hole is encrusted\r\nwith acicular crystals of pure sulphur. Attempts were formerly\r\nmade to extinguish the fire, by turning water into this hole;\r\nand, after every attempt, there was a temporary disappearance of\r\nthe smoke for several weeks; but never longer than three months.\r\nFor several years, however, they have desisted from such vain\r\nattempts, and have taken advantage of the facility afforded, by\r\nthe existence of this fire, for ventilating the mines, in the\r\nfollowing manner:--They opened a passage from their present, to\r\nthe old deserted, works; this they can open or shut, by means of\r\na close door. As the old works are very near the fire, the air\r\nin them becomes very much rarified by the heat; and probably a\r\nconsiderable portion of it is consumed (as the principal pabulum\r\nfor the combustion,) and a partial vacuum is produced. When the air\r\nin their present works, therefore, becomes impure, they open the\r\ndoor, and a strong current rushes into the old works; its place\r\nis again supplied with fresh air through the shafts. Previous to\r\nthe adoption of this mode of ventilation, they experienced great\r\ninconvenience from carbonic acid gas; and some of the workmen had\r\nbeen killed by an explosion of carburetted hydrogen gas. Since\r\nthis mode has been adopted, they have experienced no inconvenience\r\nat all from noxious gases. On inquiry, I was told that the\r\nsubstances passed through, in getting to the coal, varied in the\r\ndifferent pits. As far, however, as I could learn by inquiry, and\r\nan examination of the heaps of rubbish, the following substances,\r\nin the order in which they stand, have been found in Heth's\r\npits:--mould, clay, gravel, fuller's earth, sandstone, (at first\r\nextremely coarse and friable, but becoming more compact and hard,\r\nand having an appearance somewhat stratified as they descended,)\r\ngray and bluish clay slate, hard bluish sandstone, shale, or, as\r\nthey term it, shiver, white micaceous sandstone, extremely hard;\r\nblue slate and shale intermixed, black slate, and then the coal.\r\nThe depth of these strata differed so much in different pits, that\r\ntheir individual thickness could not be ascertained. Vegetable\r\nimpressions are very common in the slate next the coal; and they\r\nhave found the impression of a fish. Pieces of pure charcoal, in\r\nthe form of sticks, or logs, are frequently found in or on the\r\ncoal. In sinking one of the pits they met with a perpendicular\r\ncolumn, 8 inches in diameter, extending through the slate into the\r\ncoal; in all about 50 feet. Its surface was distinctly serrated,\r\nand at intervals of about 2 inches it appeared jointed, breaking\r\neasily at the joints. For the want of a better name I must call\r\nit a \"lusus naturæ;\" for it is neither clay-slate nor mica-slate,\r\nnor shale, nor sandstone; but appears to be composed of them all.\r\nMasses of a black oxide of iron are sometimes found in the slate;\r\nand from its weight and hardness the miners very properly call it\r\nironstone. Iron pyrites are very abundant in the slate, and the\r\nheaps of rubbish are white with the sulphate of alumine; yellow\r\nochre is found among the rubbish, but I could not ascertain its\r\nrelative position with any precision. The side of the hill at\r\nthe pits is covered with quartz pebbles; some of which are as\r\ntransparent and beautiful as I ever saw. The country, for several\r\nmiles around the pits, (i. e. as far as I have seen,) appears to\r\nbe entirely destitute of rocks or pebbles, and is covered with\r\na light sandy soil. I am unable to inform you of the number of\r\nhands employed at, or of the quantity of coal annually furnished\r\nfrom, these pits, as a part of my notes has, by an accident, been\r\nrendered illegible.\r\n\r\nThus, sir, I have endeavoured to comply with my promise of giving\r\nyou an account of the coal pits.[17] In doing this, I have _only_\r\nattempted to state facts as they existed; although I have no doubt\r\nthat my imperfect acquaintance with geology has occasioned many\r\nomissions which might have been interesting. To the same cause must\r\nbe attributed the use of language not always strictly scientific,\r\nand a method less exact than might have been desired. With all\r\nits imperfections, however, if you can, from the mass of facts,\r\ncull any one which may be useful or interesting, I shall be fully\r\ncompensated by the pleasure of having furnished it, for any trouble\r\nI may have been at in doing so. And, if at any time I should be\r\nable to furnish you with any information relative to the mineralogy\r\nor geology of this part of the country, I hope you will let me know\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. IV. _Sketch of the Geology and Mineralogy of a part of the\r\nState of Indiana, communicated in a letter to the Editor, by Mr._\r\nW. B. STILSON.\r\n\r\n\r\n  LOUISVILLE, (Ken.) August 11, 1818.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Sir_,\r\n\r\nI have employed a short period of leisure in passing over a portion\r\nof the state of Indiana. Among other objects, I was not wholly\r\ninattentive to the mineralogical and geological features of the\r\ncountry. I now, with diffidence, transmit to you the result of my\r\ninquiries.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKETCH, &c.\r\n\r\nThe secondary formation of the state of Indiana is abundantly\r\nevident. The surface of the soil is undulating, and marked with\r\nfew elevations which deserve the name of mountains. The rocks are\r\nsandstone, limestone, and clay-slate; all of which are disposed in\r\nhorizontal strata. The sandstone presents nothing remarkable in\r\nits appearance. Its colours are various shades of gray and brown.\r\nThe principal hills are of this formation. The principal colours\r\nof the limestone are blue and gray, and their various mingled and\r\nintermediate shades. Its secondary formation is very manifest\r\nfrom its almost earthy appearance. In innumerable instances, the\r\nlimestone rocks contain immense quantities of imbedded shells, of\r\ngreat similarity in form and appearance, and having considerable\r\nresemblance, to the common escallop-shell of the ocean. Owing to\r\nthe easy decomposition of these rocks, and the horizontal position\r\nof their strata, they afford many subterranean passages for water.\r\nA considerable stream, called Lost River, runs into a cave in the\r\nside of a precipitous hill; and, after a passage of 6 or 7 miles\r\nunder the earth, again makes its appearance, with a large accession\r\nto its waters. The traveller's attention is continually excited by\r\ncavities in the earth, where the temporary rivulets, proceeding\r\nfrom rains, make a sudden exit through perpendicular perforations\r\nin the upper stratum of the rock. There are many such cavities,\r\nwhich do not receive any water from the surface. Some of them are\r\nmany yards in diameter, forming a regular circular concave, of\r\nconsiderable depth towards the centre. They are vulgarly known\r\namong the inhabitants by the name of \"_sink-holes_.\" The localities\r\nof slate are few, and present nothing uncommon.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the particular minerals. On Sand Creek, 60 miles\r\nfrom White River, is an interesting locality of that variety\r\nof silex, commonly called burrstone. It has been examined by\r\nseveral practical millers, who do not hesitate to pronounce the\r\nspecimens which it affords, equal, if not superior, to the French\r\nburrs. The locality is twenty acres in extent, and appears to be\r\ninexhaustible. The mineral varies very much in its appearance; it\r\nis generally porous, and appears to have been puffed up by the\r\nescape of some gas, while it was in a state of fusion. A mass of\r\nwell-raised bread gives no inadequate idea of its configuration.\r\nIt produces most vivid sparks with steel. Some labourers are\r\nemployed in procuring millstones from this place; and, such is\r\nthe size of the siliceous rocks, that they are under no necessity\r\nof constructing them of detached masses. They form, of a single\r\nrock, millstones of five and a half feet in diameter, which are\r\nnot defaced by any irregularity, or even earthy cavity. These\r\nmillstones may be carried down the White, Wabash, Ohio, and\r\nMississippi rivers, to New-Orleans, with great facility. And if\r\nthey should prove as excellent as it is expected they will, this\r\ndiscovery will shed new lustre upon the accumulating evidence of\r\nthe mineralogical resources of this republic.\r\n\r\nMany other varieties of silex are common: rock crystal, agate,\r\nand chalcedony, are often found in the beds of rivulets. I passed\r\na considerable distance upon the banks of a small stream, called\r\nLeather-wood creek: the bottom of the creek was covered, the whole\r\ndistance, with siliceous masses, shaped like oblate spheroids,\r\nand of every size, from that of a large melon downwards. On being\r\nbroken, they presented beautiful geodes of crystallized quartz,\r\namethyst, &c. The outside was often fine chalcedony, and sometimes\r\nthe interior was the same substance, in the form of balls; all\r\nthese were sometimes combined, forming agates of great beauty.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime, crystallized, is sometimes found; and many of\r\nthe caves afford fine stalactites.\r\n\r\nThere is a large cave near Corydon, celebrated for the production\r\nof sulphate of magnesia, or Epsom salts. It has been explored\r\nfor the distance of several miles. When it was first discovered,\r\nthe bottom, in many places, was covered to the depth of several\r\ninches, with pure, brilliant, needle-shaped crystals of sulphate of\r\nmagnesia. By some mysterious process of nature, or rather of Divine\r\nbenevolence, the production of this useful salt is continually\r\ngoing on. This cave also produces some other salts in small\r\nquantities: nitrate of lime, nitrate of magnesia, sulphate of lime,\r\n&c.\r\n\r\nWhere the basis of the country is limestone, the waters always\r\ntake up a great quantity of lime, and some of them possess great\r\npetrifying powers. I saw many specimens of petrifactions: a tuft of\r\nmoss, the form perfectly preserved; leaves, bark, and branches of\r\ntrees; insects, and many others.\r\n\r\nMany of the springs are strongly impregnated with sulphur, and\r\nsome of them are saturated with sulphuretted hydrogen. I found\r\nthe opinion universally prevalent among the people of this state,\r\nthat the first appearance of these sulphur springs was immediately\r\nsubsequent to the earthquakes of 1812. They say, that then new\r\nsprings, impregnated with sulphur, broke out, and the waters of\r\nsome old springs, for the first time, gave indications of this\r\nmineral. A sensible farmer, who has a large sulphur-fountain,\r\nboiling up from the bottom of a river near its bank, assured me,\r\nthat there was no trace of this spring until after the period to\r\nwhich I have alluded. He could have no interest in deceiving me;\r\nand if he did deceive me, his conduct could originate only in that\r\nlove of the marvellous which is so characteristic of the human\r\nmind. He moreover assured me that the \"water had been growing\r\nweaker, (to use his phrase) ever since its first appearance.\" I\r\nhave room only to mention, among the minerals of Indiana, many\r\nvarieties of clay, ochres, gypsum, alabaster, muriat of soda, (very\r\ncommon,) iron ore, and antimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. V. _New localities of Agate, Chalcedony, Chabasie, Stilbite,\r\nAnalcime, Titanium, Prehnite, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nDeerfield, &c. In the account of the Mineralogy and Geology of\r\nDeerfield, by Mr. Hitchcock, in the present Number, it will be\r\nseen, that these interesting minerals (with the exception of\r\ntitanium) exist in the secondary greenstone of that place. We have\r\nspecimens, (through the kindness of Mr. Hitchcock,) and observe\r\nthat the agates, chalcedony, analcime, and prehnite, are imbedded\r\nin the trap; the agates are in some instances very delicate in the\r\ndisposition of their bands, and need nothing but polishing to make\r\nthem beautiful; the same is true of the chalcedony. The chabasie\r\nand stilbite occupy cavities, and the chabasie is often distinctly\r\ncrystalized in a rhomboid, so nearly approaching a cube, in the\r\nquantity of its angles, that the mistake is easily committed of\r\nsupposing them to be cubes; the crystals are sometimes transparent,\r\nand the largest a quarter of an inch in diameter. Titanium is found\r\nin Leyden; it is the red oxide--very well characterized--in reddish\r\nbrown crystals as large as a common goose quill,[18] and, in some\r\ninstances, perfectly geniculated. It is rare to see finer specimens.\r\n\r\n_East-Haven._ It will be observed, that the great ranges of\r\nsecondary greenstone, which cut Connecticut and Massachusetts in\r\ntwo, terminate at New-Haven, on the one hand, and some way above\r\nDeerfield on the other. By comparing the account of the termination\r\nat New-Haven (Bruce's Journal, v. i. p. 139.) with that now\r\npublished, of the termination at or near Deerfield, it will be\r\nseen that the geology and imbedded minerals are very similar. At\r\nEast-Haven, (one of the branches of the greenstone of New-Haven,\r\nand within from three to four miles of the latter town,) chalcedony\r\nis often found, sometimes imbedded in the trap, (but perhaps more\r\nfrequently loose among the fallen stones,) which, although in\r\nsmall pieces, is as perfect in its characters as the chalcedony\r\nof the Feroe Islands. It is of a delicate gray, translucent,\r\nmamillary, botryoidal, stalactitical, or impressed by crystals of\r\nquartz, which have usually fallen out; sometimes these crystals\r\nincrust the chalcedony.\r\n\r\nAgates also are found in considerable numbers, both imbedded and\r\nloose. They usually consist of bands of chalcedony and quartz, and\r\nsometimes of the latter only, variously striped or spotted, or\r\ninterlaced with jasper, carnelian, and cacholong.\r\n\r\nThe form of the imbedded agates at East-Haven is commonly ovoidal,\r\nor egg-shaped, and frequently it is conical. Some portions of pure\r\nchalcedony occur, which are shaped like a long, slender carrot\r\nor parsnip, and the situation of the latter in the ground would\r\nexactly represent that of the chalcedony or agate in the rock.\r\n\r\nThe imbedded masses are frequently altogether quartz, and then\r\nthey are most commonly geodes or hollow balls lined with crystals,\r\ncommonly very perfect and brilliant, although rarely large. These\r\ncrystals are commonly transparent and colourless--but they exhibit\r\nalso most of the varieties of colour which quartz assumes--the\r\namethyst--the smoky--yellow, &c., and occasionally they are tipped\r\nand spotted with red jasper.\r\n\r\nThe spontaneous decay of these trap rocks causes many specimens to\r\nbe found among their ruins, and many more are imbedded in the solid\r\nrock; but the industry of successive classes from the neighbouring\r\ncollege, issuing from Col. Gibbs's cabinet, has now made specimens\r\nmore scarce.\r\n\r\n_Woodbury._ Twenty-four miles from New-Haven, N.W.\r\n\r\nIn a geological sketch of parts of the counties of New-Haven\r\nand Litchfield, which may appear in a future Number, it will be\r\nseen that prehnite, stilbite, and agate are found at Woodbury,\r\nin the little basin of secondary greenstone which exists there;\r\nthe prehnite is abundant--it is not known whether the agates are\r\nso, although it is asserted to be the fact; the stilbite was not\r\nobserved to be abundant, although it was well characterized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. VI. _Account of the Strata perforated by, and of the Minerals\r\nfound in, the great adit to the Southampton Lead Mine. Communicated\r\nto the Editor by Mr._ AMOS EATON, _Lecturer on Geology, Botany, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Professor Silliman._\r\n\r\nAfter a laborious geological excursion along M'Clure's Springfield\r\nsection, for about one hundred miles, I visited Dr. D. Hunt, at\r\nNorthampton. He observed that you had expressed an opinion, that\r\nan attentive examination of all the strata constituting the walls\r\nof the artificial avenue or drift at the Southampton mines, would\r\nbring facts to knowledge, which might, in some degree, subserve the\r\ncause of geological science. I am now at the mouth of the drift,\r\nhaving just completed the labour which you had marked out.\r\n\r\nI employed two miners to commence with me, at the termination of\r\nthe drift, which is now extended 800 feet into the hill. We broke\r\noff large specimens, at very short intervals, throughout the\r\nwhole extent of the drift. We arrived at its mouth with almost\r\na boat load of specimens. I kept a memorandum of every thing\r\nwhich occurred, while under ground; and I have now arranged the\r\nspecimens, before the mouth of the drift, in the same order in\r\nwhich they were situated in the earth.\r\n\r\nFatigued as I am, I will make my remarks here, in the field, lest\r\nsomething should hereafter escape me, which is now fresh in my\r\nrecollection. Beginning with the greatest distance to which the\r\nminers have penetrated, I will set down my remarks, in fact, in\r\nreversed order.\r\n\r\n800 feet. The rock is fine-grained gray granite, traversed\r\nby veins, lined with quartz crystals, and mostly filled with\r\ncalcareous spar, often beautifully crystallized. In the same veins\r\nblue and purple fluate of lime and copper pyrites frequently occur.\r\n\r\n790 feet. The same fine-grained granite is continued, occasionally\r\ntraversed by veins lined with crystals of quartz; but containing no\r\nother minerals.\r\n\r\n774 feet. A narrow vein of sulphuret of lead, with walls lined\r\nwith crystals of quartz. The fairest cubic crystals are slightly\r\nattached to the points of the quartz crystals. Yellowish crystals\r\nof carbonate of lime are often interspersed among the lead.\r\nSulphate of barytes occurs here also; sometimes in plates meeting\r\nat various angles, and forming chambers lined with minute crystals\r\nof quartz. Minute crystals of copper pyrites and a little fluate of\r\nlime have been found here; also fine specimens of bitter spar. The\r\nwalls are very compact, fine-grained granite.\r\n\r\n760 feet. Coarse, parti-coloured granite. The felspar is\r\nflesh-coloured and white; the quartz often bluish or greenish; the\r\nmica silvery, greenish, or purplish.\r\n\r\n725 feet. A stratum of gray-wacke slate. Texture less firm than\r\nof the same rock at the west of Pittsfield. This stratum is very\r\ndistinct, and about two feet thick.\r\n\r\n723 feet. A stratum of serpentine rock, containing very red quartz\r\nimbedded in various directions. It is very compact, and mostly\r\ngreen. Here it is but about three feet thick. About ten miles south\r\nof this place, on Maclure's Springfield section, near the line\r\nbetween Westfield and Russel, and four miles west from Westfield\r\nAcademy, I found this same stratum of very great breadth. I say the\r\nsame stratum, because it is situated in the granitic hill, east of\r\nthe highest ridge of granite, which is evidently a continuation of\r\nthis range. Perhaps I may, hereafter, give you an account of my\r\nexcursion along that section of Maclure, in which I may give you a\r\nmore particular description of the Westfield serpentine.\r\n\r\n720 feet. Coarse granite, with white and flesh-coloured felspar,\r\nblack and silvery mica.\r\n\r\n700 feet. A stratum of red mica slate, about four feet thick.\r\n\r\n694 feet. Coarse, flesh-coloured granite. This is the handsomest\r\ngranite in the whole drift. Here we find the most beautiful\r\nspecimens of graphic granite, both flesh-coloured and gray.\r\n\r\n680 feet. A stratum of Kirwan's stell-stein. That is, an aggregate\r\nof fine-grained quartz and mica, without any felspar. The quartz is\r\nmostly greenish, probably coloured by the next stratum.\r\n\r\n670 feet. Beautiful green soapstone. Very compact, but rather\r\nsofter than that kind in common use for inkstands.\r\n\r\n666 feet. A green, granular aggregate. It seems to be made up of\r\nfine fragments of quartz, soapstone, and mica, rarely a little\r\nfelspar, slightly compacted together.\r\n\r\n_Remark._ All the strata, from the inner termination of the drift\r\nto this place, a distance of one hundred and thirty-four feet, are\r\nnearly vertical, or a very little inclined. Here they begin to\r\napproach a horizontal position.\r\n\r\nThe green aggregate continues as far as the air-well, a distance of\r\n66 feet, with some trifling variations in the size and proportions\r\nof the aggregated fragments.\r\n\r\n500 feet. A granulated, schistose aggregate, chiefly of quartz and\r\nmica. Though the constituents and the form of the rock correspond\r\nvery nearly with mica slate, it cannot be considered as the\r\nprimitive mica slate rock. It is so slightly compacted that it can\r\nscarcely be kept from falling to pieces. Its position is nearly\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\n480 feet. A stratum of coal, half an inch thick. This stratum may\r\nbe traced, at different intervals, one hundred and eighty feet\r\nalong the drift towards its mouth. It lies between the strata of\r\nthe last described schistose aggregate.\r\n\r\n400 feet. An aggregate appears, alternating with the loose\r\nschistose rock, which resembles the red sandstone, but is of a less\r\nfirm texture.\r\n\r\nFrom this place all the strata, east of the soapstone, occasionally\r\nappear, for the distance of about three hundred feet. This is\r\nprobably on account of their undulatory forms and horizontal\r\nposition. Most of the way we find the lower part of the walls to\r\nconsist of a kind of semi-indurated puddingstone. Sometimes a thin\r\nstratum of fine, loose sand occurs. At 300 feet the coal stratum\r\ndisappears, passing below the bottom of the drift.\r\n\r\nThe last hundred feet is chiefly gravel, which is now supported by\r\ntimbers.\r\n\r\n_Southampton, Aug. 26, 1818._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. VII. _On the Peat of Dutchess County--read before the Lyceum\r\nof Natural History, in New-York, by the Rev._ F. C. SCHAEFFER, _of\r\nNew-York, and by him communicated to the Editor_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May, 1817, I brought specimens of marl and _peat_ from Dutchess\r\ncounty, which were taken from a fen or bog occupying an area of\r\nsome acres. These fens occur frequently in the towns of Rhinebeck,\r\nNortheast, Clinton, &c. in Dutchess county. During a part of the\r\nyear they are covered with water.\r\n\r\nA pit was dug in the bog from which I procured the specimens. The\r\norder and depth of the well-defined strata which were exhibited\r\nby this excavation, I noted in my memorandum book, from which I\r\nextract the following:\r\n\r\nAfter clearing away the fresh sod and recent vegetable mould, there\r\nappeared,\r\n\r\n  1. A stratum or bed of _peat_ commonly called _turf_, varying in\r\n  depth from three to four feet.\r\n\r\n  2. A stratum of peat and marl commingled; depth two feet.\r\n\r\n  3. A stratum of pure marl, from two to three feet. Below these\r\n  there was an appearance of sand and blue clay.\r\n\r\nThe first, or upper stratum, consists of _compact peat_. This\r\nsubstance, when first taken up, is of a dark brown colour, soft,\r\nand rather viscid. Some vegetable fibres and vacuous seeds\r\nare distributed throughout the mass. It may be moulded to any\r\nconvenient form. When perfectly dry, the texture of this variety,\r\nof which there is a specimen before you, acquires a high degree of\r\nsolidity. Its fracture is earthy; the colour is lighter.\r\n\r\nI should not have offered more on this subject than the labelled\r\nspecimen, had I not made a most satisfactory experiment with this\r\nkind of fuel, which may be obtained in great abundance in our own\r\nState. It is easily kindled; burns with a bright flame; yields a\r\nbluish smoke, and produces an odour similar to that which attends\r\nthe combustion of gramineous substances. But this is momentary.\r\nWhen thoroughly kindled, it burns with less flame, yields a\r\nsmall proportion of blackish smoke, and sulphurous acid gas is\r\nevolved, though I cannot discover any pyrites. It burns for a\r\nlong time, and emits a great body of heat. It leaves a very small\r\nproportion of light, grayish white ashes; on which I have as yet\r\nmade no experiments, having this day, for the first time, paid\r\nparticular attention to this substance, attracted by the unusual\r\nhardness which it acquired since it is in my possession: and not\r\nmany hours have elapsed since I subjected it to combustion. The\r\nattempt succeeded so well, that I cannot refrain from expressing\r\nmy opinion, that this variety of peat will answer as an excellent\r\nsubstitute for the best Liverpool coal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. VIII. _Notices of Geology in the West-Indies._\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nIn the former Number of this work, a notice was published\r\nrespecting siliceous petrifactions of wood, from Antigua. We now\r\npublish a geological sketch of the island, with notices of some\r\nother parts of the West Indies. This communication is made by a\r\nfriend, with permission to publish it. It is a production of the\r\npen of Dr. NUGENT, of St. Johns, Antigua, a gentleman of eminent\r\nscientific acquirements, who, it is hoped, will continue his\r\nlaudable and able efforts to illustrate the natural history of the\r\nWest-Indies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Memorandum concerning the Geology of Antigua, &c._\r\n\r\nThe southern and more mountainous part of the island consists of\r\n_trap_ rocks; more particularly of trap breccia and wacké-porphyry.\r\nOn these beds rests a series of very peculiar stratified\r\nconglomerate rocks. These strata vary exceedingly in colour and\r\nthickness, but all dip, at a considerable angle, to the northwest.\r\nThe more usual character of this rock, is that of a clayey basis,\r\nwith minute particles of felspar, and small spots of _grünerde_[19]\r\n(or chlorite Baldogée.) This latter is frequently diffused over the\r\nwhole, and gives it a green tinge: the colour has been thought by\r\nsome to proceed from the impregnation of copper, but I am rather\r\nof opinion that is owing to manganese and iron. The conglomerate\r\ncharacter of this rock, is derived from its having imbedded in\r\nit, or incorporated with it, numerous fragments, of all sizes, of\r\npetrified wood, chert, with and without coralline impressions,\r\nagate, jasper, amygdaloid, greenstone, hornstone, porphyry,\r\nporphyry slate, and other substances.\r\n\r\nOn this singular class of strata, reposes an extensive calcareous\r\nformation, occupying the northern and eastern part of the island,\r\nhaving _subordinate_ to it, and at its lowest part, where it is in\r\ncontact with the conglomerate, large beds and patches of chert,\r\nwhich contains also a vast variety of petrified woods, several\r\nof which are of the palm tribe, with silicified shells, chiefly\r\n_cerithea_; though at the Church-hill, at St. Johns, formed of\r\nthis chert, casts of bivalve and ramose madrepores are likewise\r\nfound. The calcareous beds are principally of a friable marl,\r\nwith blocks and layers of limestone irregularly included. In this\r\n_formation_[20] are many fossil shells, both in the calcareous and\r\nsiliceous state; and there appear to be some beds, wherein is a\r\nmixture of shells of marine, and others of a fresh water, or at\r\nleast a terrestrial origin. The coralline agates found in nodules\r\nand patches therein, and which may readily be distinguished from\r\nthe coralline chert of the previous beds, are the most beautiful\r\nwhich have any where been yet noticed; and when well selected and\r\npolished, make very pleasing ornaments.\r\n\r\nThe island, as well as Barbuda, thirty miles to the northward,\r\nthe Grande Terre part of Guadaloupe, at a similar distance to the\r\nsouthward and eastward, with several others of the West-India\r\nIslands, give proof of an extensive formation, more recent than\r\nthose to which naturalists have heretofore principally confined\r\ntheir' attention; and which is, perhaps, contemporaneous with, if\r\nnot later than, the Paris Basin, so well described by Cuvier and\r\nBrongniart.\r\n\r\n  _April 10th, 1818._      N.

IX. _Discovery of Native Crystallized Carbonate of Magnesia on\r\nStaten-Island, with a Notice of the Geology and Mineralogy of that\r\nIsland, by_ JAMES PIERCE, ESQ. _of New-York, in a Letter to the\r\nEditor_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  NEW-YORK, October 19, 1818.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI forward you a few mineral specimens characteristic of\r\nStaten-Island, including native carbonate of magnesia, in acicular\r\ncrystals. I discovered this new form and locality of magnesia in\r\nexamining the strata exhibited in an excavation now making, under\r\nthe delusive expectation of finding gold, about three miles from\r\nthe Quarantine. In descending the shaft, sunk perpendicularly in\r\nsteatite, magnesite, veins of talc, and green translucent asbestus\r\nwere observed at depths from six to thirty-five feet. The magnesite\r\nwas found to embrace veins and cavities containing native carbonate\r\nof magnesia, in very white acicular crystals, grouped in minute\r\nfibres radiating from the sides, but not always filling the veins\r\nand cavities. The crystals were, in some instances, suspended,\r\nassuming a stalactical form. This carbonate of magnesia dissolves\r\nentirely in diluted sulphuric acid, with considerable effervescence\r\nand chemical action, producing a bitter compound, from which salts\r\nof easy solution are formed by evaporation. The magnesite in which\r\nthese crystals are found, appears to be composed of carbonate of\r\nmagnesia, steatite, and talc, disintegrating readily upon exposure\r\nto air and moisture: it effervesces considerably in sulphuric acid,\r\nforming a very bitter fluid that soon exhibits crystals, indicating\r\nthat magnesia enters in large proportion into its constitution.\r\nMagnesite may perhaps be found at this place in quantity sufficient\r\nfor a successful manufacture of Epsom salts. Small regular\r\nhexaedral crystals of mica, were noticed in steatite. Chromate of\r\niron was sparingly diffused through the different minerals raised\r\nfrom various depths.\r\n\r\nA few remarks and facts respecting the geology and mineralogy of\r\nStaten-Island, may, perhaps, give some additional interest to the\r\nspecimens presented.\r\n\r\nStaten-Island (which constitutes Richmond county) is situated\r\nabout seven miles southwest of the city of New-York, extends\r\nfrom northeast to southwest about fifteen miles, in a straight\r\nline, with an average width of six. It exhibits a considerable\r\ndiversity of surface. The eastern part is composed principally of\r\nelevated ground: a mountain chain is observed to take its rise\r\nin the vicinity of a narrow sound called the Kills, and sweep,\r\nin a semicircular form, near the eastern shore; it then ranges\r\nsouthwest, parallel with, and distant from Amboy Bay, about two\r\nmiles, terminating near the centre of the island, and forming, with\r\nthe exception of some passages, a continued chain, which, on the\r\neastern and southern sides, is very steep, but not precipitous;\r\nit gradually declines to the west and north, and, in some places,\r\nit presents on its summit table land of considerable extent. A\r\nprominent ridge crosses the island, connecting the elevated ground\r\nof the south, with the hills of the northern part. A species of\r\nsteatite, containing veins of common, indurated, and scaly talc,\r\namianthus, and most of the varieties of asbestus, and some chromate\r\nof iron, constitutes the nucleus of the whole mountain range and\r\nelevated ground of the eastern division, stamping it as primitive.\r\nThis steatite approaches, in most places, within a foot and a half\r\nof the surface, and appears in small angular loose blocks, wherever\r\nthe soil has been removed. Its colour is a greenish yellow; it is\r\nbrittle, very adhesive to the tongue, but little unctuous, and\r\nprobably contains more alumine and less magnesia than steatites in\r\ngeneral. Much of it decomposes when exposed to air and moisture,\r\nand forms a good mould, whenever the descent of ground permits an\r\naccumulation of earth. It is not improbable, that in most places of\r\nthe Staten-Island hills, when magnesia constitutes a considerable\r\ningredient of the rock, it will be found saturated with carbonic\r\nacid, obviating the objection to common magnesian minerals in\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nThe minerals observed on the surface of the northeast part of this\r\nchain of hills are, secondary greenstone, asbestoid, sandstone,\r\ngranite, and gneiss, sparingly scattered in rolled masses. In\r\naddition to these rocks, in the middle and western part of the\r\nchain, a mineral of uncommon appearance is observed. It is composed\r\nprincipally of quartz, rough, with numerous cells of various\r\nforms, in which small siliceous crystals are generally found:\r\nthe veins or plates of quartz that intersect each other, often\r\nembrace talc and oxide of iron, which, decomposing, gives some\r\nspecimens the appearance of volcanic origin. Associated with this\r\ncellular ferruginous quartz, brown hæmatite is often observed;\r\nthis valuable ore often yields eighty per cent. of iron of best\r\nquality; its fibres assume a variety of shapes; they were observed\r\nat Staten-Island, straight and curved, radiating from a centre, and\r\nexhibiting the stalactical, cylindrical, and botryoidal forms,\r\noften displaying a black polished surface and glistening lustre.\r\nFerruginous minerals are abundant on the mountain for several\r\nmiles. A granular oxide, called by miners shot-ore,[21] from its\r\nbeing principally composed of spherical grains of various sizes,\r\nwas often noticed, and appears in some places in extensive beds:\r\nit is easily fused, and affords a large per centage of good iron\r\nfor castings. A heavy ore, with a smooth surface and some lustre,\r\nbearing a considerable resemblance to native iron, is sometimes\r\nseen. Banks of white sand, resembling the siliceous particles of\r\nthe seashore, are noticed on the mountain tops, containing masses\r\nof compact, heavy ferruginous sandstone, similar to the rocks of\r\nour alluvial seaboard. Large beds of water-worn siliceous pebbles,\r\nin no way differing from those washed by the ocean, are seen on\r\nthe height of the ridge, in which excavations have been made\r\nseveral feet, leaving the depth of the mass uncertain. On some of\r\nthe eminences, for a considerable extent, vegetation is entirely\r\nexcluded by an iron-bound soil. Iron ore, imbedded in an earth\r\ncoloured by, and partly composed of, oxide of iron, occupies the\r\nsurface; and chalcedony and radiated quartz are sometimes observed\r\non the primitive ridge. Prospects from many of these eminences\r\nare extensive and diversified. On one side, the ocean and a great\r\nextent of coast are in view; on the other, a rich landscape of\r\nhills and plains, the eye resting on the highland-chain and the\r\nmountains bordering Pennsylvania; the harbour, at your feet,\r\npresents a busy, ever-varying scene, and the city of New-York\r\nappears to great advantage from this point of observation.\r\n\r\nThe district between the mountain and the narrows, the thickly\r\nsettled and well-cultivated plain bordering Amboy bay, and much\r\nof the western division of the island, are decidedly alluvial.\r\nAdjacent to Fort Tompkins, detached pieces of copper ore have been\r\nfound. I have observed petrifactions of marine shells in rocks\r\nexcavated in that neighbourhood, twenty feet from the surface, and\r\nsixty above the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe western part of the island presents moderate elevations; the\r\nsoil, a good medium of sand and clay, is in general fertile; but\r\na tract near the termination is sandy and barren. Some creeks\r\npenetrate to near the centre of the island, and are bordered by\r\nextensive salt meadows. Except at the primitive range, I have\r\nobserved in no part of the island large beds of rock that can\r\nbe called in place; but rolled masses of greenstone, sandstone,\r\ngneiss, granite, red jasper, and indurated clay, appear in general\r\nsparingly, but sometimes in abundance, on the surface. Lignite has\r\nbeen found in small quantities in the western part of the island. A\r\nchalybeate spring, of no great strength, is the only mineral water\r\nmet with in Richmond county. The ponds, wells, and streams, contain\r\na soft water, holding no lime in solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nWe have already published (p. 54.) Mr. Pierce's discovery of\r\nthe pulverulent carbonate of magnesia, and have pointed out its\r\nconnexion with Dr. Bruce's previous discovery of the hydrate of\r\nmagnesia, or pure magnesia combined with water only. Mr. Pierce\r\nhas now added another important link to this chain, and future\r\nmineralogists may quote the vicinity of New-York as affording,\r\n\r\n  1. Pure magnesia, crystallized and combined with water only.\r\n\r\n  2. Carbonate of magnesia, pulverulent and white.\r\n\r\n  3. Carbonate of magnesia, in very delicate and perfectly white\r\n  acicular crystals.\r\n\r\nWe possess specimens of them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. X. _On a curious substance which accompanies the native Nitre\r\nof Kentucky and of Africa. Communicated in a letter to the Editor,\r\nfrom_ SAMUEL BROWN, M. D. _late of Kentucky, now of the Alabama\r\nTerritory_.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nThe scientific public were several years ago laid under obligations\r\nto Dr. Brown, for a very interesting and instructive account of\r\nthe nitre caverns, &c. of Kentucky, published in the Transactions\r\nof the Philosophical Society, in Philadelphia, Vol. VI., and in\r\nBruce's Journal, Vol. I. p. 100. The following communication arose\r\nfrom a conversation on that subject between Dr. Brown and the\r\nEditor.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _New-Haven, July 27, 1818._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI have just found the passage I referred to the other day, relative\r\nto the existence of native or sandrock nitre in the interior\r\nof Southern Africa. It is in Barrow, and not in Vaillant, as I\r\nthought when I had the pleasure of conversing with you concerning\r\nit. I am much obliged to you for recalling my attention to that\r\ncurious subject, as it has brought to my recollection a fact,\r\nwhich I believe I omitted to mention in my memoir, (viz.) the\r\nexistence of a black substance in the clay under the rocks, of a\r\nbituminous appearance and smell. This I remember to have seen in\r\na rock-house, near the Kentucky river, where very considerable\r\nquantities of sandrock nitre had been obtained. This substance was\r\nfound in masses of a few ounces weight, and in the crevices of the\r\nrocks near the basis of the side walls. The smell was not wholly\r\nbituminous, but resembled that of bitumen combined with musk. I\r\nam quite unable to account for the formation of the nitre, or the\r\nproduction of this black substance which sometimes accompanies it,\r\nboth in Africa and America. Had I seen Mr. Barrow's travels, when\r\nI noticed the bitumen, I should certainly have paid more attention\r\nto it. But perceiving no relation between the rock nitre and\r\nthe masses of this substance, my examination of it was much too\r\nsuperficial. I do not very well understand what Mr. Barrow means by\r\nsaying, that many wagon loads of animal matter lay on the _roof_\r\nof the caverns in Africa. I saw no such matter on the _roof_ of\r\nthe rock-houses in Kentucky. Certainly the caverns have been the\r\nhabitations of wild beasts, and great quantities of leaves, &c.\r\nhave been mixed with the debris of the superincumbent rocks, but it\r\ndoes not seem probable, that much animal matter could be filtrated\r\nthrough a roof of rock, perhaps forty or fifty feet in thickness.\r\nThe subject, however, is very curious, and deserves much more\r\nattention than any of us have bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract from Barrow's Southern Africa, p. 291. New-York edition._\r\n\r\n\"About 12 miles to the eastward of the wells, (Hepatic wells,) in a\r\nkloof of the mountain, we found a considerable quantity of _native\r\nnitre_. It was in a cavern similar to those used by the Bosgesmans\r\nfor their winter habitations, and in which they used to make the\r\ndrawings above mentioned. The _under surface_ of the projecting\r\nstratum of calcareous stone, and the sides that supported it, were\r\nincrusted with a coating of _clear, white saltpetre_, that came\r\noff in flakes, from a quarter of an inch to an inch or more in\r\nthickness. The fracture resembled that of refined sugar, it burnt\r\ncompletely away without leaving any residuum; and if dissolved in\r\nwater, and thus evaporated, crystals of _pure prismatic nitre_ were\r\nobtained. This salt, in the _same_ state, is to be met with _under_\r\nthe sandstone strata of _many_ of the mountains of Africa; but,\r\nperhaps, not in sufficient quantities to be employed as an article\r\nof export. There was also in the same cave, running down the sides\r\nof the rock, a black substance, that was apparently bituminous.\r\nThe peasants called it the urine of the das. The dung of this\r\ngregarious animal was lying upon the roof of the cavern to the\r\namount of many wagon loads. The putrid animal matter, filtrating\r\nthrough the rock, contributed, no doubt, to the formation of\r\nthe nitre. The Hepatic wells and the native nitre rocks were in\r\nthe division of Agster Sneuwberg, which joins the Tacka to the\r\nsouthwest.\"\r\n\r\nShould I ever visit Kentucky again, I hope that I shall be able to\r\ngive a better account of these caverns, which certainly are highly\r\ndeserving of the attention of naturalists.\r\n\r\nIn Philadelphia you may have an opportunity of seeing some small\r\nspecimens of the sandrock, containing nitre, now in the cabinet of\r\nthe Philosophical Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XI. _Descriptions of species of Sponges observed on the shores\r\nof Long-Island. By_ C. S. RAFINESQUE, _Esq._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sponges are one of the most singular productions of nature;\r\nand, even to this time, naturalists are divided in opinion\r\nrespecting their real rank in the scale of organized beings. Some\r\nbelieve that they are animals, belonging to the class of polyps,\r\nnext to the genus of _alcyonium_, while many contend that they\r\nare not animals, but plants, of the tribe of _fuci_, or marine\r\nvegetables. I am inclined to adopt this latter opinion, since in\r\nall those which I have seen, in Europe and America, no perceptible\r\nmotion nor sensibility was to be discerned in any stage of their\r\nexistence; and those who have acknowledged their animality, bring\r\nno stronger proof thereof than an occasional slight shrinking under\r\nthe hand, and an animal smell, which are common to some marine\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nWhatever be the truth on the subject, these doubtful opinions\r\nprove that they are of the many connecting links between animals\r\nand plants. This is not a proper place to decide this controversy;\r\nI mean merely to make known new species of this tribe of beings,\r\nwhich I observed last year, on the shores of Long-Island. Such a\r\nfragment will be, perhaps, the first attempt of the kind; when more\r\nspecies shall be known, the subject may be investigated with more\r\ncertainty and accuracy.\r\n\r\n1. _Spongia albescens_, Raf. (Whitish sponge.) Effuse, compressed,\r\nirregular, perforated, somewhat branched, unequally lobed, whitish,\r\nsmooth; lobes truncated; cells porose, very minute, nearly equal;\r\nsmall unequal cells inside.\r\n\r\nFound near Bath and Gravesend, in sandy bottoms. A large species,\r\nsometimes over a foot broad, of quite an irregular shape, rather\r\nflattened, about one inch thick; partly gibbose; concave now and\r\nthen, and with large, irregular openings, as if large branches\r\nwere anastomosed; circumference branched or lobed, very jagged,\r\nsinus obtuse, lobes elongated obtuse, truncate or flat, unequally\r\ndivided. The substance is entirely of a cinereous white, outside\r\nand inside, of a soft and brittle nature, rather friable; covered\r\noutside with minute pores of an oblong or round shape, and full of\r\nsmall unequal cells inside.\r\n\r\n2. _Spongia ostracina_, Raf. (Oyster sponge.) Very branched, erect,\r\nred, papillose; branches unequal, often dichotome, obtuse; cells\r\nporose, oblong, nearly equal.\r\n\r\nIt is often found on the common oyster. (_Ostrea virginica._)\r\nIt rises from four to six inches, the colour is a fine red, it\r\nbranches from the base; the branches are unequal, straight,\r\ncylindrical, or compressed. Substance stupose. Surface covered with\r\nsmall papilla and small oblong unequal pores.\r\n\r\n3. _Spongia cespitosa_, Raf. (Bushy sponge.) Branched, cespitose,\r\nyellowish, rough, papillose; branches fasciculated, upright,\r\nunequal, flexuose, compressed, slightly anastomosed, nearly\r\ndichotome upwards; cells porose, oblong, nearly equal, margin\r\nlacerated.\r\n\r\nFound also on the oyster, but more seldom than the foregoing;\r\nthe specimens which I saw was found on the Bluepoint oysters, by\r\nDr. Eddy. It becomes brown by drying. It rises from four to six\r\ninches, the margin of the cells or pores is torn into papillar,\r\nstiff processes, which produce a rough surface. Substance stripose.\r\nInternal cells oblong, very small.\r\n\r\n4. _Spongia cladonia._ (Cladonian sponge.) Branched effuse, smooth,\r\npale fulvous, stem procumbent, branches distichal, one-sided,\r\nerect, simple or divided, obtuse; cells porose, minute; some larger\r\nround.\r\n\r\nI have found this species at Bath and at Sandy-Hook, on Sandy\r\nbottoms. Length about six inches. Stem and branches cylindrical\r\nor compressed. Substance fibrose, anastomed, branches divaricate,\r\nascendent, semi dichotomose or simple, unequal, thicker towards the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\n5. _Spongia virgata._ (Slender sponge.) Nearly branched, smooth,\r\nfulvous, stem divided, slender, cylindrical, knobby, branches\r\nerect, slender, nearly heads acute; pores unequal, irregular, small.\r\n\r\nA small species, three inches high, found at Oysterbay, on rocky\r\nbottoms, rare; stem with few branches, and imperfect ones, like\r\nknobs. Substance stupose. Branches round, alternate, small. Pores\r\nwithout any determinate shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XII. _Memoir on the Xanthium maculatum, a New Species from the\r\nState of New-York, &c. by_ C. S. RAFINESQUE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nPursh and Michaux mention only one species of American _Xanthium_,\r\nthe _X. strumarium_, while there are three noticed in the catalogue\r\nof Dr. Muhlenberg, the above species, and the _X. orientale_, and\r\n_X. spinosum_. The first and the last are natives of Europe, and\r\nhave been naturalized in the United States, with many other plants.\r\nThe species called _X. orientale_ by Dr. Muhlenberg, appears\r\nhowever to be a native; but the _X. orientale_ of Linnæus, is a\r\nnative of Siberia, Japan, and the East-Indies; and when plants are\r\nfound to grow in such opposite quarters of the globe, a strong\r\npresumption arises that they are not identical species, which\r\npresumption has been confirmed by experience in many instances,\r\nwhenever the plants of both countries have been accurately\r\nexamined. Decandolle, in the French Flora, (2d edit, of 1815.) vol.\r\n6. p. 356, describes, under the name of _X. macrocarpon_, a species\r\nfound in France, and which he takes to be the real _X. orientale_\r\nof Linnæus. He has changed its name, because, he says, that it is\r\nnot certain that the _X. orientale_ grows in Asia; or, if any grows\r\nthere, that it is identic with his species; which, however, is\r\nreally the _X. orientale_ of Linnæus, Son, Lamark, and Gaertner. He\r\nadds, that he possesses in his herbarium, a species from Canada,\r\ndifferent from his _X. macrocarpon_ which has been figured by\r\nMorison, on whose authority some authors have asserted that the _X.\r\norientale_ grew in Canada, mistaking his figure for that plant.\r\n\r\nFrom the above statement, it appears that much obscurity\r\nand difficulty arises in botany, when errors creep into the\r\ndistinction of species: to detect those errors, and to ascertain\r\nthe synonyme of obscure species, is not one of the least useful\r\nbotanical labours. Having found, last year and this year, in the\r\nneighbourhood of New-York, a species of _Xanthium_ different from\r\nany described by the authors, and intermediate between the _X.\r\nstrumarium_ and _X. orientale_ of Linnæus, I presume that it may\r\nbe the _X. orientale_ of Muhlenberg, Leconte, and Morison, and the\r\n_Xanthium_ of Canada, mentioned by Decandolle, Dumont, &c. I have\r\ngiven to it the name of _X. maculatum_, since the stem is spotted\r\nlike the _Conium maculatum_. None of those authors having described\r\nit, I suppose that its description will be acceptable, and will\r\nserve to fix this new species among the American botanists.\r\n\r\nTherefore it will appear, that the _X. orientale_, which had been\r\nconsidered as a native of Asia, Europe, and America, is composed of\r\nat least three species; the European species, which has been called\r\n_X. macrocarpon_ by Decandolle, the American species, which I have\r\ncalled _X. maculatum_, and the Asiatic species, to which the name\r\nof _X. orientale_ ought to remain; but which ought to be better\r\ndescribed, and more fully distinguished from the _X. macrocarpon_\r\nby those who may chance to meet with it. I even suspect that many\r\nspecies grow in Asia, since that of Ceylon may be different from\r\nthe Chinese and Siberian species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Xanthium Maculatum._\r\n\r\n_Definition._ Stem flexuous, round, rough, spotted with black;\r\nleaves long-petiolate, cuneate-reniform, nearly trilobe,\r\nsinuate-toothed, obtuse, rough, and thick; fruits elliptic, obtuse\r\nmuricate; thorns rough.\r\n\r\n_Description._ The root is annual, thick, and white. The stem rises\r\nfrom one to two feet; it is upright, without thorns, very thick,\r\nand with few branches; it is covered with oblong, black, and rough\r\nspots. The leaves are few, but large, with very long petiols; they\r\nare nearly reniform, with an acute base, and have three nerves;\r\nthe teeth are unequal, large, and obtuse. The flowers and fruits\r\nare disposed as in _X. strumarium_; but the fruits are generally\r\nsolitary; they are half an inch long, nearly cylindrical obtuse,\r\nwith the two beaks scarcely perceptible and bent in, covered with\r\nshort, thick, and rough thorns, rather soft, and not uncinate. The\r\nwhole plant has a peculiar smell, not unpleasant, somewhat between\r\nthe camphorate and gravulent odour, but weaker than in _Conysa\r\ncamphorata_, &c.\r\n\r\n_History._ This plant grows on Long-Island, near the seashore and\r\nmarshes. I have found it common near Bath, on the downs, and in\r\nNew-Jersey, near Bergen, and Powles Hook, on the margin of marshy\r\nmeadows. According to Dr. Mulenberg, it grows also in Pennsylvania;\r\nMessrs. Torrey and Leconte found it on the island of New-York; and\r\nby Morison and Decandolle's account, it is found as far north as\r\nCanada. It blossoms in August and September, but the fruits remain\r\non the plant till the severe frosts of December.\r\n\r\n_Observations._ This species differs from the _X. macrocarpon_ of\r\nDecandolle, by having smaller fruits, without horns, and whose\r\nthorns are neither hooked nor hispid; by not having an angular\r\nstem, but a round, spotted one, and by its leaves being broader,\r\nand not serrate, &c. Nearly all those differences exist between it\r\nand the _X. orientale_ of Asia, which has not yet been isolated\r\nfrom the _X. macrocarpon_. The _X. edrinatum_ differs from this by\r\nhaving oval fruits, with aggregated, echinate, and hooked thorns;\r\nand the _X. strumarium_, by having cordate hirsute leaves, the\r\nfruits aggregated, with hooked thorns and horned tops. The _X.\r\nspinosum_, and _X. fruticosum_, ate so totally different that they\r\nneed not be compared.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZOOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XIII. _Description of the Phalaena Devastator, (the Insect\r\nthat produces the Cut-worm,) communicated for the American Journal\r\nof Science, &c. by_ Mr. JOHN P. BRACE, _of Litchfield, Conn._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis moth, whose larva is one of our most destructive enemies,\r\nbelongs to the Linnæan family noctua, in the genus phalaena. Its\r\nspecific characters are as follow: Wings incumbent and horizontal,\r\nwhen at rest; body long and thin; thorax thick, but not crested;\r\nhead small; eyes prominent and black; antennæ setacious, gradually\r\nlessening towards extremities, and slightly ciliated; palpi two,\r\nflat, broad in the middle, and very hairy; tongue rolled up between\r\nthem, not very prominent; clypeus small, legs long, small and\r\nhairy; wings long as body; under wings shortest; colour a dark\r\nsilvery gray, with transverse dotted bands of black on upper wings.\r\nThe insect lays its eggs in the commencement of autumn, at the\r\nroots of trees and near the ground: they are hatched early in May.\r\nThe habits of the cut-worm have been often and fully detailed. They\r\neat almost all kinds of vegetables, preferring beans, cabbages,\r\nand corn. They continue in this state about four weeks; they then\r\ncast their skin and enter the _pupa_ state, under ground. This is a\r\ncrustaceous covering, fitted to the parts of the future insect. In\r\nthis they continue for four weeks longer, and come out in the fly,\r\nor insect state, about the middle of July. All those chrysalids\r\nthat I exposed to the sun, died; and all those that were kept cool\r\nunder earth, produced an insect: hence I infer, that the heat of\r\nthe sun will kill the chrysalids. If, then, the ground be ploughed\r\nabout the first of July, many of those insects might be destroyed,\r\nand the destruction of the productions of the next year prevented;\r\nfor the _pupa_ is never more than a few inches under ground.\r\n\r\nThe phalaena devastator is never seen during the day; it conceals\r\nitself in the crevices of buildings, and beneath the bark of trees.\r\nAbout sun-down it leaves its hiding-place, is constantly on the\r\nwing, and very troublesome about the candles in houses. It flies\r\nvery rapidly, and is not easily taken.\r\n\r\nSuch is the description of this formidable enemy to vegetation. No\r\nefficacious method has yet been taken to prevent its ravages, but\r\nthe one who could accomplish it, would do the cause of agriculture\r\nan essential service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XIV. _Description of a New Genus of North American Fresh water\r\nFish, Exoglossum, by_ C. S. RAFINESQUE, ESQ.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Lesueur has published, in the 5th Number of the Journal of\r\nthe Academy of Sciences of Philadelphia, for September, 1817, the\r\ndescription of a new fish, which he calls _Cyprinus maxillingua_:\r\nhe considers it as a very singular and anomalous species, owing to\r\nthe peculiar structure of its lobed lower jaw and tongue, which\r\nis external, and situated as an appendage to the former. It was\r\ndiscovered in Pipe-creek, Maryland, in June, 1816, by said author,\r\nwho confesses that he does not consider it as properly belonging to\r\nthe genus _Cyprinus_, and presumes that when other species shall\r\nbe discovered, possessing the same character, they will constitute\r\na separate genus. Although this principle and presumption is\r\ncorrect, it was wrong to delay the formation of such a distinct\r\ngenus, because only a species was then known, since so many genera\r\nare composed of single species. However, Mr. Lesueur's expectation\r\nwas verified even before he wrote it, since in May, 1817, I had\r\ndiscovered in the Fishkill, State of New-York, another, species,\r\nevidently congenerous with the _Cyprinus maxillingua_, having the\r\nsame structure of the mouth, &c. I therefore venture to establish\r\na separate genus for those two species, having no doubt that many\r\nmore will hereafter be added to it by accurate observers, and I\r\ngive to it the name of _Exoglossum_, meaning _outside tongue_.\r\nIt will belong to the same natural order and family of the genera\r\n_Cyprinus_, _Catostomus_, &c.\r\n\r\nEXOGLOSSUM. _Generic Definition._--Body oblong, thick, and scaly;\r\nhead without scales, mouth without lips or teeth, upper jaw longer,\r\nentire; the lower trilobed, middle lobe longer, performing the\r\noffice of tongue; dorsal fin opposite to the abdominal fins; three\r\nrays to the branchial membrane.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._ Besides the above characters, the two species known at\r\npresent have, in common, the lateral line ascending upwards at the\r\nbase, the tail forked, &c.\r\n\r\n1.

For\r\nfurther particulars, see Lesueur's description, p. 85. cum. ic. I\r\nhave been obliged to change the specific name of _maxillingua_,\r\nsince it has the same meaning as the generic name.\r\n\r\n2. Species. _Exoglossum annulatum_, Raf. Head black above, cheeks\r\nand gills olivaceous, back blackish olive, sides olivaceous, lower\r\nparts olive gray; a black ring at the base of the tail; lateral\r\nline ascending upwards at the base, tail forked, dorsal and anal\r\nfins with nine rays.\r\n\r\n_Remarks._ Length from three to six inches; vulgar name, _Black\r\nchub_.

XV. _On the Revolving Steam-Engine, recently invented by_\r\nSAMUEL MOREY, _and Patented to him on the 14th July, 1815, with\r\nfour Engravings_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To Professor Silliman._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\nThe successful employment of the steam-engine, in navigating the\r\nrivers and inland waters of the United States, and the probable\r\nextension of this mode of conveyance of persons and property, makes\r\nthose improvements desirable which adapt the steam-engine to this\r\npurpose with less complication and expense, placing it more within\r\nreach of individual enterprise, and rendering it even useful on our\r\nsmall rivers and canals.\r\n\r\nThe steam-engine, though often seen in operation, is not readily\r\nunderstood by an observer, without an acquaintance with the\r\nfacts in natural philosophy on which its power depends: and it\r\nmay elucidate the subject of this communication to advert, for\r\na moment, to the gradations by which this important machine has\r\nattained its present perfection.\r\n\r\nIt will be recollected that as early as 1663, the Marquis of\r\nWorcester published some obscure hints of a mechanical power\r\nderived from the elastic force of steam.\r\n\r\nIn 1669, Savary, availing himself of the suggestion, and pursuing\r\nthe subject more scientifically, invented his engine, consisting\r\nof an apparatus to cause a vacuum by the condensation of steam, so\r\nthat the water to be raised would thereupon, by the external weight\r\nof the atmosphere, rise into the chamber of the apparatus, which\r\nthe steam had occupied.\r\n\r\nAs caloric becomes latent in the steam which it forms at 212° of\r\nFahrenheit, and the steam thus formed occupies 1800 times the bulk\r\nof the water composing it; and as it returns instantly to a state\r\nof water on losing its heat, by contact with any thing cold, Savary\r\neasily produced his vacuum by the injection of a little cold water.\r\n\r\nHe also used (though in a very disadvantageous manner) the\r\nexpansive force of steam to drive the water out of the chamber,\r\nthrough a pipe different from that by which it entered.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether this kind of engine was ever erected on\r\na scale of any magnitude; for, a few years later, Newcomen and\r\nCrawley invented the first engine with a cylinder and piston; and\r\nSavary, abandoning his own, united with them in bringing their\r\nengine into use.\r\n\r\nAs steam drives out air, the principle of this engine was to let\r\nsteam into the cylinder beneath the piston, where (the piston\r\nhaving risen to the top of the cylinder) a jet of cold water[22]\r\ncondensed the steam, produced a vacuum, and the piston, working air\r\ntight, descended by the pressure of the atmosphere upon it, this\r\npressure being a weight of nearly fifteen pounds to each square\r\ninch; so that if the cylinder were two feet diameter, it would\r\namount to a weight of three tons.\r\n\r\nThis mode of operation prevailed for about fifty years, and though\r\nmuch used to pump water from mines, was found to have great\r\ninconveniences and defects; till, in the year 1762, Mr. Watt, being\r\nemployed to repair a working-model of an engine at the University\r\nof Glasgow, was led to direct his mind to the improvement of the\r\nmachine; and from his experiments sprung the most essential change,\r\nviz. the condensation of the steam in the cylinder, by opening a\r\ncommunication with a separate vessel, into which the injection of\r\ncold water was made, thus allowing the cylinder to remain hot.\r\n\r\nOn opening that communication, the steam instantly rushes to the\r\ncold, or rather is destroyed by the instant loss or reduction of\r\nits heat, and the vacuum thus made allows the piston to descend as\r\nbefore mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pl. I._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pl. II._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pl. III._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pl. IV._]\r\n\r\nMr. Watt soon added the airpump to the condenser, to extract the\r\nair extricated from the water in boiling, together with the water\r\ninjected.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to close the upper end of the cylinder, the\r\npiston-rod working through a tight packing to exclude the air,\r\nletting the steam in above, as well as below the piston, by an\r\nalternate communication, and then condensing it in both cases\r\nalternately, thus producing a double stroke; at the same time\r\nderiving some aid from the expansive force of the steam on the\r\nside of the piston opposite to the vacuum. This is essentially the\r\nform of all the engines in use at the present day. The minor parts\r\ndevised by Mr. Watt, as the working of the valves, &c. were such as\r\nwould readily occur to a scientific mechanician.\r\n\r\nWhile he was bringing the engine to its present perfection,\r\nand furnishing it for the numerous mines, manufactories, and\r\nbreweries in Great Britain, variations were devised by Cartwright,\r\nby Hornblower, Woolf, and others in England, and more recently\r\nby Evans and by Ogden in America, evincing much ingenuity, but\r\n(with the exception of Evans's, which is a simple engine of high\r\npressure) making the machine more complex.\r\n\r\nWatt and Bolton's engine, as most generally used, being properly\r\nan atmospheric engine, or working with steam so low as merely to\r\nproduce a vacuum in the cylinder, became of enormous dimensions,\r\nwhen the power required was that of an hundred horses: a scale\r\nof estimate adapted to the comprehension of those who had before\r\nused the labour of that animal, and preferred to substitute the\r\nsteam-engine.\r\n\r\nIt had not, however, escaped the notice of Mr. Watt, that\r\nthere existed in steam another source of power besides that of\r\natmospheric pressure. The experiments of his learned friend, Dr.\r\nBlack, of Glasgow, as well as those of the French chemists, and\r\nof Papin, in the instance of his digester, had ascertained the\r\nlaws of its expansive force, and amongst other interesting facts,\r\nthose subservient to our present purpose; viz. That after water has\r\nreached the boiling point, 212° of Fahrenheit, the caloric which\r\nenters it no longer becomes latent, but sensible in the steam,\r\nwhich thereupon acquires expansive force to an unlimited degree:\r\nthat this force increases geometrically; or, that every accession\r\nof about 30° of heat, nearly doubles its power at those stages\r\nof progression; that when the pressure at a high temperature is\r\ntaken off, or the steam allowed to flow, there is an instantaneous\r\nand rapid production of steam; a fact which proves there can be\r\nno necessity of a large space for the steam to form in above the\r\nwater, provided it be sufficient to prevent water from issuing with\r\nthe steam, and, therefore, that boilers of a small cylindrical form\r\nare best.\r\n\r\nIt may be a fair question, why Mr. Watt did not further employ this\r\nprinciple of expansive force? We may readily conceive of several\r\nmotives to the contrary. Watt and Bolton's engines were in great\r\ndemand; they gave entire satisfaction, and the work they performed\r\nsaved so much labour as to afford the purchase at a high price. The\r\npublic had gained immensely by this better form of the engine, and\r\nMr. Watt enjoyed the benefits of the patent he had obtained; and,\r\nat a later period, this preference was increased by an accident\r\nwhich happened to Trevethick's engine, though caused by gross\r\nmismanagement, that would have been equally fatal to any other.\r\n\r\nFrom an investigation, by a committee of parliament, into the\r\ncauses of the several fatal explosions of steam-engine boilers\r\nwithin a few years, published in Tillock's Magazine, vol. 1., it\r\nappears that in every instance the accident was fairly attributable\r\nto neglect or mismanagement. Many competent persons were summoned\r\nto give their opinions; and through the contrariety of their\r\ntestimony, the prevalent opinion appears to have been, that\r\ncast-iron boilers cannot be safe; that as many engines of high\r\nsteam as of low are now used in England, but that the high are much\r\nthe most economical in fuel and cost; that they are more safe, if\r\nproperly constructed; it being argued by some, that boilers for\r\nsteam of 100 pounds to the inch, are easily made of strength to\r\nsustain 500 pounds; this excess being much greater than in those\r\nconstructed for low steam, makes them comparatively the safest, as\r\nthe safety valves are less liable to be accidentally prevented from\r\nventing the steam.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, instances are not wanting of the successful\r\noperation of high steam; of which the engine at the mint is a\r\nconspicuous example. There can, indeed, be no good reason why\r\nthis great power should not be employed to an extent within the\r\nlimits of safety, if more economical and convenient. If boilers\r\ncan bear (as they are usually made of iron) 500 pounds, there can\r\nbe no danger in using them with fifty; and this gives an increase\r\nof power, with a condenser, fourfold, or makes a ten horse power\r\nforty. The economy, therefore, of high steam, hardly admits of a\r\nquestion. It seems unphilosophical to neglect a power so great,\r\nmerely because it is so.\r\n\r\nMr. Watt was desirous of an improvement by which to obtain a direct\r\nrotatory motion. His experiments, resembling those of Curtis, at\r\nNew-York, were not found permanently practicable.\r\n\r\nIt was probably perceived to be a great object to get rid of\r\na reciprocating movement of large masses, on the well-known\r\nmechanical principle, that it consumes power to check momentum, as\r\nwell as to give it--to drag an inert mass into motion rapidly, in\r\nopposite directions. And in engines for navigation this is more\r\ndisadvantageous than for land uses, as the foundation of the engine\r\ncannot be perfectly substantial.\r\n\r\nAn engine, therefore, that possesses the cylinder and other\r\nmembers of Watt's engine, working with or without a condenser,\r\nat pleasure--having a rotatory movement--requiring no ponderous\r\nbalance-wheel--adapted to high steam--attended by no inconvenience\r\nfrom the rapidity of its stroke or movement--having no inert mass\r\nof machinery to move reciprocally--more powerful, proportionately,\r\nfrom its using steam as strong as that in the boiler--of a simple\r\nand durable construction, and by a combination of two similar\r\nmachines attached to the same common intermediate axis, operating\r\nso as to give nearly an equal power at every moment of its\r\noperation, seems to combine every thing desirable in an engine for\r\nthe purposes of navigation. Such appears to be the revolving engine\r\ninvented by Mr. Morey.\r\n\r\nWhen those who are acquainted with steam-engines of the atmospheric\r\nkind only, are told that Morels cylinder revolves, their\r\nimaginations may suppose a moving mass as large as the enormous\r\ncylinders they have been accustomed to see: but it is not so; the\r\nelastic force of steam requires machinery but of comparatively\r\nsmall dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe revolving engine makes up in activity what in other engines is\r\nsupplied by magnitude.\r\n\r\nWe will take for example the engine working at the glass\r\nmanufactory, in this vicinity, the cylinder of which has one foot\r\nstroke and nine inches diameter, and is at least a ten horse power,\r\nworking with fifty pounds--or, the engine now building for the\r\nHartford boat. This engine will have two cylinders of seventeen\r\ninches diameter and eighteen inch stroke; they will revolve fifty\r\ntimes a minute. The area of the piston in each being 227 inches,\r\nsteam at fifty pounds will give an hundred horse power.\r\n\r\nThis boat is seventy-seven feet long, twenty-one feet wide, and\r\nmeasures one hundred and thirty-six tons. The engine, with its\r\nboilers, will occupy sixteen feet by twelve, or one-eighth only\r\nof the boat; the cylinders being hung on the timbers of the deck\r\nover the boilers. She is principally intended to tow vessels up the\r\nriver to Hartford.\r\n\r\nIn towing, it is of importance that the engine admit of any\r\ninferior velocity or power, till some momentum is had. An engine\r\nworking by atmospheric pressure does not admit of this. And as the\r\nboat herself, at the moment of commencing the operation, may have\r\nno steerage-way, by placing two blade-rudders at the sides, behind\r\nthe water-wheel, where a current is occasioned by them, the boat is\r\nkept in her relative position.\r\n\r\nThe application of the steam-engine to the towing of other vessels\r\nwas fully appreciated by the late Mr. Fulton, whose conspicuous\r\nlabours and enterprise, in the establishment of steam-boats,\r\nthe public duly honours. His active mind had conceived of its\r\nutility; and he would have obtained a patent, had not the previous\r\nemployment of steam in this way, and the award of arbitrators\r\non the question been in my favour; which I mention merely in\r\nreference to the supposed utility of this mode of operation, in\r\nconnexion with Morey's engine.\r\n\r\nMorey's engine should rather be denominated a revolving engine than\r\na rotatory one, especially as it is essentially different from one\r\nso called invented by Mr. Curtis.\r\n\r\nPlate I. Fig. 5, represents the arrangement of a double engine\r\nfor a boat, with its cylinders in different positions. _a a\r\na_, boilers; _b b_, tar-vessel; _c_, valve-box; _d_, cylinders\r\nin different positions; _e_, piston-rod; _f_, pitman; _h_,\r\ncentre-piece; _i i_, shaft; _k_, valve; _l_, steam-pipe; _m_,\r\nescape-pipe; _n_, condensers; _t_, water-wheel; _v_, face of the\r\nvalves; _x_, tar-fire. The frame, holding the cylinder (_d_) is, by\r\nits opposite sides, so hung as to revolve. To the end of the axis\r\nof one side, extended over the cylinder, is fixed the centre-piece\r\n(_h_) resembling a crank, from which the bar or pitman (_f_)\r\ncommunicates to the cross-piece of the piston-rod. On this same\r\naxis, but outside the frame, is placed two circular pieces, one\r\nof brass, the other of iron, (_k_) which we may call the valves.\r\nOne is fixed on the axis, the other moves, and accompanies the\r\nframe and cylinder in its revolution; from it, at opposite sides,\r\npipes lead the steam to each end of the cylinder. It has a smooth\r\nface, which applies, and is kept by springs close to that of its\r\ncounterpart fixed on the said axis. Steam-pipes lead from the\r\nboilers through the counterpart into the moving valve. On the\r\nopposite side of the fixed piece the eduction-pipe (_o o_) leads to\r\nthe condensers.\r\n\r\nThe condensers (_p_) are upright vessels, two to each cylinder,\r\nconnected at top by a sliding valve box, so that the steam enters\r\nthem alternately. At bottom are two valves, kept closed by weights.\r\nA stream of water is injected into the condensers, which escapes by\r\nthe bottom valves (_p p_) by which also the air is blown out, at\r\nevery stroke, in the same manner the engine is cleared of air at\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nThere are also two cocks and cross-pipes seen, Plate III. Fig. 4,\r\nto change the steam from one side to the other of the valve, to\r\ngive a reversed motion of the engine.\r\n\r\nThe power is communicated to its object from the opposite side of\r\nthe frame by the axis attached thereto, and supported on bearings.\r\nThis axis (_i i_) may be of any length; may terminate in a crank\r\nor cog-wheel, or another cylinder (as here represented) may be\r\nattached thereto at right angles to the first, to co-operate and\r\nproduce, at every moment, equal power.\r\n\r\nPlate II.

Profile of the above. _a a_, the boiler; _c_,\r\nvalve; _d e g_, cylinder and frame; _f_, valve; _h h_, cog-wheels;\r\n_i_, cog-wheels to move the pumps; _k k_, condensers; _m m_,\r\ncoverings in; _o o_, gas-fire flue.\r\n\r\nFig. 1. _a_, steam-pipe; _b_, escape-pipe; _c_, fixed valve; _d_,\r\nmoving valve; _e_, axis; _f_, a washer; _g_, section of frame; _h_,\r\na washer; _i_, centre-piece; _l l_, steam-pipe; _k k_, springs to\r\nkeep the valves together.\r\n\r\nThe canal-boat has her wheel in the stern. (See Plate IV.) The\r\nmotion is given by a cog-wheel upon its axis (_g_) played upon\r\nby another, upon a shaft, at right angles, to which the engine\r\ncommunicates motion. The wheel being divided by a space of two or\r\nthree inches, into two parts, to allow room for this shaft, and for\r\nthe support of its end.\r\n\r\nFig. 3, represents the arrangement of the machinery, occupying\r\nthe after-part of the boat. An engine of twenty horse power may\r\nthus occupy half a canal-boat, can tow a number of others at such\r\nrate as may be proper on canals.[23] _b b_, the boilers; _c_,\r\ntar-vessel; _d_, the cylinder; _f_, water-wheel.\r\n\r\nThe supply of water to the boilers is either by a pump, in usual\r\nform, or by the _supply-chamber_ of my invention, (Plate III. Fig.\r\n2.) which consists simply of a pipe having two stop-cocks, one end\r\nin a reservoir, the other opening into the boiler at top, sloping\r\ndownward for a foot or two. The cocks are in the sloping point. The\r\noperation commences, by opening the cock nearest the boiler, the\r\nsteam drives the air out of the pipe through the water into the\r\nreservoir; shut the cock, and the water rises from the reservoir\r\nto fill it; shut the second cock, and open the first, the water\r\ndischarges from the chamber into the boiler; repeated by a movement\r\nfrom the engine, when in motion, the supply continues with more\r\ncertainty than by a pump, because it is difficult to pump hot\r\nwater, on account of the elasticity of the steam arising from it,\r\nwhich obstructs the operation of the valves. And it is important\r\nnot to have to pump against the pressure of high steam.[24]\r\n\r\nPlate III. Fig. 4.

Fig. 1 shows the side-rudders, _d_,\r\n_e_, &c.\r\n\r\nTo this engine is conveniently applied the gas-fire, in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\nThe boilers being cylindrical, with an inside flue for fuel, two or\r\nthree are placed close together, and set in the following manner:\r\nFirst, cross-bars of iron are laid on the timbers, a platform of\r\nsheet-iron is laid on these bars, coated over with clay mortar,\r\nor cemented, to keep out the air. Upon the sheet-iron, and over\r\nthe bars below, are placed cast-iron blocks in shape to fit the\r\ncurve of the boiler, so as to raise it three or four inches above\r\nthe platform. The sheet-iron is continued up the outsides of the\r\nouter boilers, so as to enclose them; and at one end, between the\r\nboilers, there are small grates for coal or other fuel.\r\n\r\nThe tar vessel or vessels, as the case may be, are lodged in the\r\nspace between and upon the boilers, and a small fire may be made\r\nunder them, if necessary. A pipe leads steam in at one end, two\r\npipes at the other; one near the bottom, and one near the top, lead\r\nout the tar and steam. These pipes unite below; the steam and tar,\r\nthus mingled in suitable proportions, flow to the main fire, or the\r\nflues of the boilers, as well as to the coal-fire below, where\r\nthe gas and tar are ignited. The fireman judges of the proportion\r\nof each, by the effect; the object being to produce a nearly white\r\nflame without appearance of tar. Thus flame is applied to the\r\ngreatest possible surface, and the apparatus adds very little to\r\nthe cost of the engine.\r\n\r\nThere are also two improvements in the boiler, which I deem it\r\nimportant to mention. First, the lining or covering of the flue\r\nwithin with sheet-iron or copper, _perforated with small holes_,\r\nreaching down its sides, nearly to the bottom. Plate III. Fig. 2.\r\n_a_ the boiler; _b_ the flue; _d_ the grate; _c c_ the lining.\r\n\r\nThis causes the water to circulate rapidly between them to the top\r\nof the flue, and protects it from being run dry, or heated red hot,\r\nwhen the water gets, by accident, too low. The lining also _causes\r\nthe steam to form much faster, in consequence of this circulation_.\r\n\r\nThe other is the interior boiler. A vessel occupying the back part\r\nof the flue. Plate II. Fig. 8. (_d_) communicating downwards with\r\nthe water, and upwards with the steam of the main boiler. The fire\r\nacts upon it very forcibly, surrounding it on all sides.\r\n\r\nI have said there is no reciprocating movement in Morey's engine.\r\nShould it be objected that the piston moves in the cylinder as\r\nusual, it must be apparent that it also moves circularly; it is\r\nin fact the cylinder that moves, carrying the piston with it,\r\nwhich gives and keeps up the motion, by drawing and pressing on\r\nthe centre-piece, and communicating the resistance thence to the\r\n_guides_ of the cross-piece on the insides of the frame, which thus\r\nreceives its motion.\r\n\r\nIn fact, this form of the engine seems divested of all the usual\r\ndrawbacks on its power, and leaves it to act freely with any\r\nvelocity, according to the strength of the steam in the boilers.\r\n\r\nSuch it appears in principle, and such thus far in practise. I have\r\ntherefore preferred it for the purposes of navigation, and have\r\npurchased the patent right. But, though interested to recommend it,\r\nI cannot expect it to be preferred by the intelligent, if there is\r\nnot merit in the invention, and great economy in its use. It may be\r\nconsidered the most direct application of the power, and the most\r\nunexceptionable mode of using the expansive force of high steam.\r\nAnd from the nature of its movement the most applicable to boats\r\nand vessels.\r\n\r\nYour Journal being the intended medium of information to promote\r\nthe useful arts, I hope it may be consistent with this object\r\nto explain the manner in which these improvements may be made\r\nextensively useful.\r\n\r\nIt being necessary to supply the engines at a reasonable rate,\r\nI have established a manufactory for this kind only. The great\r\nexpense of steam-boats hitherto, has confined their use too\r\nexclusively to the accommodation of passengers. There is a wide\r\nfield opening for their use, in freighting, on all our waters; and\r\nit is often of importance to a community, when great savings can be\r\nmade, that large capitalists should be induced to engage that such\r\nsavings may be greater. Where companies are formed for an extensive\r\noperation, the legislature may, with propriety, grant an extension\r\nof the time for patents to run, that such persons may be duly\r\nremunerated for their enterprise, by the duration of the service.\r\n\r\nOur laws do not yet make a proper distinction between patents of a\r\nlarge and expensive kind and those requiring little or no capital\r\nto go into operation. The period of fourteen years remunerates the\r\ninventor of those improvements only that require no capital, and\r\ninvolve no risk.\r\n\r\nOn this ground several of the State legislatures have, with good\r\npolicy, given encouragement to this kind of enterprise. They\r\nsuspend the free use of the invention a few years, rather than\r\nloose its immediate operation on a large scale of public benefit.\r\n\r\nThe constitutionality of the measure plainly appears by its not\r\ninterfering with the laws of the United States. It is not an act\r\nexclusive of, or in opposition to, patents, but acknowledging\r\nand confirming them. It is furthering and giving effect to the\r\nintentions of the general government, in the encouragement of\r\nuseful inventions. For their own particular section of the union,\r\na State legislature may thus provide for the protection of capital,\r\nengaged in enterprise of uncommon risk, as well as of uncommon\r\nusefulness, without excluding other and better inventions, should\r\nthey arise.\r\n\r\nI shall ask leave to communicate, for some future Number, the\r\nresults of experiments, now making, with the gas fire applied to\r\nengines.\r\n\r\n  I am your most respectful humble servant,\r\n\r\n  JOHN L.

A small quantity of\r\nthe fulminating powder, at the distance of a few feet, was merely\r\nflashed, by a coal of fire, but without explosion. In a manner, not\r\neasily understood, the whole quantity of powder under the large\r\nglass instantly exploded with an astounding report; _but the glass\r\nwas not exploded_--it was merely thrown up a little; in its fall\r\nit was shattered, and broke a glass which it hit, but no fragment\r\nwas _projected_, and none of the other contiguous tubes and glasses\r\nwere even overset, nor were any of a large audience, and some of\r\nthem very near, even scratched; _but the plank, one and a half inch\r\nthick, on which the powder lay, had a hole blown quite through,\r\nalmost as large as the palm of one's hand_. This is a striking\r\ninstance to prove that the _initial_ force of this powder, when\r\nexploded, is very great, but that it extends but a very little way.\r\nIf it be strewed through a glass tube of three-fourths of an inch\r\nin diameter, and exploded by a coal of fire or hot iron, the tube\r\nmay be held in the naked hand, and the powder only flashes without\r\nbreaking the tube, and merely coats it over inside, and that very\r\nprettily, with the revived quicksilver.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fulminating Silver._\r\n\r\nChemists are too well acquainted with the tremendous energy of\r\nthis preparation, to make any comment upon its powers necessary.\r\nUnhappily, however, it is now made a subject of amusement; it is\r\nprepared for sale by those who know nothing of it, except as a\r\nnostrum, and it is bought by others who have not even this degree\r\nof knowledge. It is true it is put up in small quantities, in the\r\nlittle toys called torpedoes, and, if exploded one by one, they\r\nwill ordinarily do no harm; but as they fall into the hands of\r\nchildren, we can never be secure that they will be discreetly used.\r\n\r\nA very severe accident, from the unexpected explosion of\r\nthis substance, occurred some years since in the laboratory\r\nof Yale College. (See Bruce's Journal, Vol. I. p. 163.) And,\r\nnotwithstanding that this occurrence was well known in New-Haven,\r\nthe same accident, only under a severer form, has again occurred in\r\nthat town.\r\n\r\nA man who had bought the secret of making fulminating silver, had\r\nprepared as much as resulted from the solution of one ounce and\r\na half. Apparently, in a great measure, unaware of the nature of\r\nthe preparation, he had placed it, unmixed with any thing, on an\r\nearthen plate, which stood on a table; his wife and children being\r\naround, he sat down to distribute the powder upon several papers\r\nwhich he had prepared for the purpose; sand and shot are mixed\r\nwith the powder in the papers for the purpose of giving momentum,\r\nand of producing attrition when the torpedo is thrown, in order\r\nto ensure its explosion. Probably also the sand, looking not very\r\nunlike the powder, may be intended to screen it from view, and thus\r\nto preserve the secret, should the papers be opened. The unhappy\r\nman no sooner touched the fulminating silver with a knife, than it\r\nexploded with its usual violence; the table was split in two; blood\r\nissued copiously from every part of his face, not from wounds, for\r\nit does not appear that the fragments hit him, but, according to\r\nthe opinion of a competent judge, the blood was actually forced\r\nthrough the pores of the skin by the power of the explosion, which\r\nvery nearly destroyed his eyes. He suffered immensely, but now, at\r\nthe end of eight months, sees partially with one eye, but the other\r\nis nearly, if not quite, destroyed.\r\n\r\nShould not the tampering with such dangerous substances by ignorant\r\npeople be prevented by law?\r\n\r\nIn a late lecture in the laboratory of Yale College, some\r\nfulminating silver, on the point of a knife, was in the act\r\nof being put upon a copper-plate connected with one pole of a\r\ngalvanic battery in active operation, the other pole was not\r\ntouched by the experimenter; but it seems that the influence which\r\nwas communicated through the floor of the room was sufficient\r\ninstantly to explode the powder, as soon as the knife touched the\r\ncopper-plate; the knifeblade was broken in two, and one half of it\r\nthrown to a distance among the audience.\r\n\r\nRecently also, we are informed, in one of the foreign journals,\r\nthat a man in England, who accidentally trod on a quantity of\r\nfulminating silver, had his foot nearly destroyed by the explosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUSEFUL ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART.

Communicated to the Editor by\r\nMr._ ISAAC DOOLITTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Paris, 16th May, 1818._\r\n\r\n  MY DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nA few days since I visited the very interesting establishment of M.\r\nRobert, for the extraction of the gelatinous matter from bones.\r\n\r\nThe bones used for this purpose are those only which answered\r\nno useful purpose (except for the fabrication of phosphorus or\r\nammoniac) before this discovery, such as those of the head, the\r\nribs, &c. &c., the legs of sheep and calves, &c. Those formerly\r\nused by _toysmen_ (_Tabletiers_) are still used for that purpose,\r\nafter extracting so much of the gelatine as can be done by\r\nebullition.\r\n\r\nWhen the heads of oxen are to be operated upon, they begin by\r\nextracting the teeth, (these are reserved for the fabrication of\r\nammoniac, as affording a greater proportion of that alkali than any\r\nof the other bones,) they then break the skull, in such manner as\r\nto preserve all the compact parts in as regular forms as possible;\r\nthese pieces present a surface of 20 to 30 square inches, and are\r\nput to soak in a mixture of muriatic acid and water. The muriatic\r\nacid used bears about twenty-three degrees o£ the _aeromètre_,\r\nand is diluted by water to about six degrees--four parts of the\r\nliquor is used to one part of bones. They are left in this state,\r\nin open vessels, until a complete solution of the phosphate of\r\nlime has taken place, and the gelatinous part of the bone remains\r\nin its original shape and size, and is perfectly supple. When this\r\noperation is finished, which commonly lasts six or eight days, the\r\ngelatine is put into baskets, being first drained, and immersed\r\na short time in boiling water, in order to extract any small\r\nremains of grease, which would deteriorate the gelatine, and also\r\nto extract any of the acid which might be lodged in the pores. It\r\nis then carefully wiped with clean linen, and afterward washed in\r\ncopious streams of cold water, to whiten it, and render it more\r\ntransparent; it is then put to dry in the shade.\r\n\r\nTwo ounces of this gelatine are said to be equal to three pounds of\r\nbeef in making soup--that is, three pounds of beef and two ounces\r\nof gelatine will make as much soup, and of as good quality, as six\r\npounds of beef. It is constantly used in some of the hospitals of\r\nthe capital, particularly in the lying-in-hospital.\r\n\r\nThe ends of the bones, and such parts as from their porosity might\r\nstill retain a portion of the acid, are separated, and used for\r\nmaking glue of a very superior quality.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the bones of sheep's legs furnish a sort of\r\nmembranous glue, which supplies, with advantage, the place of\r\nisinglass in the fabrication of silk stuffs.\r\n\r\nI give you these particulars, not because I think they contain any\r\nthing new to you, _in principle_, but because I may have hit upon\r\nsome _details_ with which you were unacquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XX. _Experiments made in France upon the Use of Distilled\r\nSeawater for domestic purposes, and its Effects on the\r\nConstitution, when taken as a Beverage._[25]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn consequence of the great want of good fresh water in many of\r\nthe maritime parts of France, the government some time since\r\nordered some experiments to be made, upon an extensive scale, in\r\norder to ascertain how far seawater, when distilled, could be used\r\nwith success. Little or no use had hitherto been made of water so\r\nprepared, except in long voyages, and chiefly then only as a matter\r\nof necessity. There are above two hundred leagues of seacoast in\r\nFrance, where, to the breadth of many miles, the inhabitants are\r\ncompelled to make use of bad and impure water, which, in many\r\ncases, is injurious to the health of themselves and their animals.\r\nIn similar cases, it was the custom of the ancients to construct\r\ncisterns; but these are not only expensive in themselves, but\r\ntheir utility depends upon the quantity of rain that falls; while\r\nupon the shores of the most barren places, nature has supplied a\r\nvariety of vegetable matter, which, when dried, would not only\r\nserve as a fuel for the purposes of distillation, but from the\r\nashes of which might be obtained a saline substance, sufficient to\r\nrepay the expense of collecting, drying, and burning. Thus the fuel\r\nfor the distillation of seawater would, in reality, cost nothing,\r\nwhile its preparation would employ many individuals, particularly\r\nwomen and children. Before, however, erecting any apparatus for\r\nthis purpose, it was necessary to ascertain both the utility and\r\nsalubrity of the water thus prepared.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Bougainville, Phipps, Homelin, &c. had\r\nemployed this water with much success; but they, like most of the\r\nchemists of the last age, did not endeavour to imitate the process\r\nof nature in all its simplicity, but mixed various substances\r\nwith the seawater, in order to take away or lessen the effect of\r\nthe empyreuma arising from the distillation, and which was so\r\nunpleasant to the smell and taste. And it is this which in general\r\nrenders sailors so averse to it, and excites a prejudice very\r\nunfavourable to the salubrity of distilled seawater. One of the\r\ngreat objects to be ascertained was, whether this disagreeable\r\nsmell and taste was peculiar to seawater or arose from the act of\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\nIn the month of July, last year, the king ordered some experiments\r\nto be made, upon a large scale, at the three ports of Brest,\r\nRochefort, and Toulon. The instructions given were as follows: That\r\na sufficient quantity of seawater should be distilled to prepare,\r\nfor the space of a month, bread and other food for a certain number\r\nof criminals, who were employed on the works of these ports, and\r\nalso to supply them with drink, keeping from them during that\r\nperiod every other liquid. Ten or twelve persons at each part\r\nvoluntarily came forward and offered themselves for the experiment.\r\n\r\nThe persons employed by government first distilled a sufficient\r\nquantity of seawater, without the admixture of any other substance.\r\nThis produce dissolved soap, dressed vegetables, produced the same\r\nappearances, with the aerometer, as that distilled from spring\r\nwater. There was no difference between the one and the other. But\r\nthe distilled seawater had always that empyreumatic taste and\r\nsmell, of which we have before spoken; and it was so strong, that\r\nthe commission at Toulon called it _odeur de marine_, and _odeur de\r\nmarecage_. But this is not peculiar to seawater, for the result of\r\na distillation of fresh water had always the same taste and smell.\r\nNeither of these liquids immediately loses this by being filtered\r\nthrough charcoal; but by being exposed for some time to the air,\r\nthe distilled seawater loses this unpleasant quality, and then it\r\ndoes not differ from fresh water derived from the purest source;\r\nand both have equally stood every chemical test to which they have\r\nbeen exposed. The chemical properties of this water having thus\r\nbeen determined, it remains to give an account of the effects\r\nupon the individuals who underwent the experiment. These are the\r\nprincipal results:\r\n\r\n_Brest._ During the first days, those who drank the water\r\ncomplained of a weight upon the stomach. This indisposition, which\r\nwas the only one they experienced, soon decreased upon taking\r\nexercise, and totally went off by an additional ounce of biscuit\r\nadded to their common ration. One of them, on the 29th day, had a\r\nfew symptoms, but which he himself attributed to an indigestion,\r\nfrom some bacon he had eaten. Eight individuals drank twenty-five\r\npints a day, rather more than three pints each,--(N. B. The French\r\npint contains very near fifty-seven cubic inches of English\r\nmeasure, and is the regulation size for the claret or Bordeaux\r\nbottle; but in general the bottles are rather smaller. The French\r\npint is therefore equal to rather more than nineteen-twentieths of\r\nan English quart, wine measure.)\r\n\r\n_Toulon._ The results obtained at the arsenal of this town, were\r\nnot less decisive or satisfactory. The six persons who made\r\nthe experiment acquired a greater degree of freshness in their\r\nappearance, and were much fatter. Their daily consumption of\r\ndistilled water was nine pounds (_poids de marc_) for drink,\r\nand eleven pounds for cooking. This is nearly the same relative\r\nquantity as those at Brest.\r\n\r\n_Rochefort._ The experiments here have not been made with the same\r\nregularity; because the fifteen persons fixed upon had all agreed\r\nto say that they were very ill. The two principal ones complained\r\nof violent cholics and diarrhœas: but the plot was discovered,\r\nand upon being put upon the sick-list, (_à la diète_,) they\r\nwere laughed at by their companions. No one of them was really\r\nindisposed; on the contrary, many thought they experienced some\r\ngood effect in regard to some infirmities under which they had long\r\nlaboured.\r\n\r\nThe above are not, however, the only experiments which have been\r\nmade upon this beverage. Several persons wishing to ascertain\r\nits effects by individual experience, have voluntarily confined\r\nthemselves to its use; and the members of the commission of inquiry\r\nare almost in the daily practice of taking it. The captain of the\r\nDuclat has taken it every day at his meals for twenty days, and\r\nhas experienced not the smallest inconvenience from its use. M. M.\r\nVasse, and Chatelain, apothecaries to the marine at Brest, have\r\noccasionally kept the water in their mouths for four hours, by\r\nconstantly renewing it, and have not found either the sharp taste,\r\nor other caustic qualities, which have been said to be peculiar\r\nto it. And here it may be proper to state, that the mouths of\r\nall the individuals who had taken the water for a length of time\r\nwere examined, without the detection of any thing in them either\r\nof a swollen or inflammatory appearance. Such are the reports of\r\ncommissioners employed to investigate the effects of distilled\r\nseawater, who, although separated at a great distance from each\r\nother, and having no communication, all agree in the inference,\r\nthat it may be employed without any injury to the health, both as\r\na beverage and in cookery, for the space of at least a month; and\r\nthe fair presumption is, that it may be employed for a much longer\r\ntime; and that in consequence, it must be considered as a very\r\nhappy resource in long voyages of discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINE ARTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART.

By Professor_ FISHER, _of\r\nYale College_.\r\n\r\n[_Concluded from page 35._]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION V.\r\n\r\n  To determine that position of any degree in the scale, which will\r\n  render all the concords terminated by it, at a medium, the most\r\n  harmonious; supposing their relative frequency given, and all the\r\n  other degrees fixed.\r\n\r\nThe best scheme of temperament for the changeable scale, on\r\nsupposition that all the concords were of equally frequent\r\noccurrence, is investigated in Prop. III. But it is shown, in\r\nthe last Proposition, that some chords occur in practice far\r\nmore frequently than others. Hence it becomes necessary to\r\nascertain what changes in the scale above referred to, this\r\ndifferent frequency requires. Any given degree, as C, terminates\r\nsix different concords; a Vth, IIId, and 3d above, and the same\r\nintervals below it. Let the numbers denoting the frequency of\r\nthese chords below C be denoted by _a_, _b_, and _c_, and their\r\ntemperaments, before the position of C is changed, by _m_, _n_,\r\nand _p_: and let the frequency of the chords above C be denoted by\r\n_a′_, _b′_, and _c′_, and their temperaments by _m′_, _n′_, and\r\n_p′_, respectively. If, now, we regard any two of these 6 chords,\r\nwhose temperaments would be diminished by moving C opposite ways,\r\nand of which the sum of the temperaments is consequently fixed, it\r\nis manifest that the more frequent the occurrence, the less ought\r\nto be the temperament. Were we guided _only_ by the consideration\r\nof making the aggregate of dissonance heard in them in a given\r\ntime, the least possible, we should make the one of most frequent\r\noccurrence perfect, and throw the whole of the temperament upon the\r\nother. Let, for example, _a_ be greater than _a′_, and let _x_\r\nbe any variable distance to which C is moved, so as to diminish\r\nthe temperament _m_, of the chord whose frequency is expressed by\r\n_a_. Then the temperament of _a_ will become = _m_ ~ _x_, and that\r\nof _a′_ = _m′_ + _x_. Hence, as the dissonance head in each, in a\r\ngiven time, is in the compound ratio of its frequency of occurrence\r\nand its temperament, their aggregate dissonance will be as\r\n\r\n  a · (m ~ x) + a′ · (m′ + x);\r\n\r\na quantity which, as _a_ is supposed greater than _a′_, evidently\r\nbecomes a minimum when _x_ = _m_, or the chord, whose frequency is\r\n_a_, is made perfect. But in this way we render the harmony of the\r\nchords very unequal, which is, cæteris paribus, a disadvantage.\r\nAs these considerations are heterogeneous, it must be a matter\r\nof judgment, rather than of mathematical certainty, what precise\r\nweight is to be given to each. We will give so much weight to the\r\nlatter consideration, as to make the temperament of each concord\r\n_inversely as its frequency_. We have then\r\n\r\n  a : a′ :: 1/(m - x) : 1/(m′ + x);\r\n\r\nwhich gives x = (am - a′m′)/(a + a′).\r\n\r\nBut there are six concords to be accommodated, instead of two; and\r\nit is evident that all the pairs cannot have their temperament\r\ninversely as their frequency, since the numbers _a_, _b_, &c.\r\nand _m_, _n_, &c. have no constant ratio to each other. This,\r\nhowever, will be the case, at a medium, if _x_ be made such, that\r\nthe _sum_ of the products of the numbers expressing the frequency\r\nof those chords whose temperaments are increased by _x_, into\r\ntheir respective temperaments, shall be equal to the sum of the\r\ncorresponding products belonging to those chords whose temperaments\r\nare diminished by _x_. Applying this principle to the system of\r\ntemperament in Prop. III, which flattens all the concords, it\r\nis plain that raising any given degree by _x_ will increase the\r\ntemperaments of the concords above that degree, and diminish those\r\nof the concords below it. Hence it ought to be raised till\r\n\r\n  (m - x) a + (n - x)b + (p - x)c = (m′ + x)a + (n′ + x)b′ +\r\n  (p + x)c′;\r\n\r\nfrom which _x_ is found\r\n\r\n  = (am - a′m′ + bn - b′n′ + cp - c′p′) /\r\n        (a + a′ + b + b′ + c + c′)\r\n\r\nShould either of the temperaments be sharp, the sign of that term\r\nof the numerator, in which it occurs, must be changed; and should\r\nthe total value of the expression be negative, _x_ must be taken\r\nbelow C.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION VI.\r\n\r\n  To determine that system of temperaments for the concords of\r\n  the changeable scale, which will render it, including every\r\n  consideration, the most harmonious possible.\r\n\r\nWe can scarcely expect to find any direct analytical process, which\r\nwill furnish us with a solution of this complicated problem, at\r\na single operation. We shall therefore content ourselves with a\r\nmethod which gradually approximates towards the desired results.\r\nThe best position of any given degree, as C, supposing all the rest\r\nfixed, is determined by the last proposition. In the same manner\r\nit is evident that the constitution of the whole scale will be the\r\nbest possible, when no degree in it can be elevated or depressed,\r\nwithout rendering the sums of the products there referred to,\r\nunequal. We can approximate to this state of the scale, by applying\r\nthe theorem in Prop. V. to each of the degrees successively. It\r\nis not essential in what order the application is made; but for\r\nthe sake of uniformity, in the successive approximations, we will\r\nbegin with that degree which has the greatest sum _a_ + _a′_ +\r\n_b_ + &c. belonging to it, and proceed regularly to that in which\r\nit is least. Making the equal temperament of Prop. III., (in\r\nwhich the Vths, IIIds, and 3ds are flattened, 154, 77 and 77,\r\nrespectively.) the standard from which to commence the alterations\r\nin the scale required by the unequal frequency of different chords,\r\nand beginning with D, the theorem gives _x_ = 5. Hence supposing\r\nthe rest of the degrees in the scale unaltered, it will be in the\r\nmost harmonious state, when D is raised 5/540 of a comma. For by\r\nthe last proposition, the temperament of the six concords affected\r\nby changing the place of D is best distributed, and that of the\r\nother concords is not at all affected. We will now proceed to the\r\nsecond degree in the scale, viz. A; in which the application of\r\nthe theorem gives _x_ = 13. In this application, however, as D was\r\nbefore raised 5, _m_, the temperament of the Vth below A, must be\r\ntaken 154 + 5; and in all the succeeding operations, when the\r\nexterior termination of any concord has been already altered, we\r\nmust take its temperament, not what it was at first, but what it\r\nhas become, by such previous alteration. In this manner, the scale\r\nis becoming more harmonious at every step, till we have completed\r\nthe whole succession of degrees which it contains.\r\n\r\nLet us now revert to D, the place where we began. As each of the\r\nouter extremities of the chords which are terminated by D has\r\nbeen changed, a new application of the theorem will give a second\r\ncorrection for the place of D; although, as the numbers _a_, _a'_,\r\n_b_, &c. continue the same, it will be less than before. Continue\r\nthe process through the whole scale, and a second approximation to\r\nthe most harmonious state will be obtained. In this manner let the\r\ntheorem be applied, till the value of _x_ is exhausted, for every\r\ndegree; and it will then be in the most harmonious state possible.\r\nThree operations gave the following results:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE V.\r\n\r\n  +------+-----------+-----+-----+\r\n  |      |    1st    | 2d. | 3d. |\r\n  |Bases.| Operation.|     |     |\r\n  +------+-----------+-----+-----+\r\n  |  F♯  |    +18    |  +5 |  +1 |\r\n  |  F   |    -20    |  -6 |  -1 |\r\n  |  E♯  |    +18    |  +5 |   0 |\r\n  |  E   |    +14    |  +5 |   0 |\r\n  |  E♭ |    -69    |  -8 |  -1 |\r\n  |  D♯  |    +19    |  +5 |  +1 |\r\n  |  D   |     +5    |  +2 |  +1 |\r\n  |  D♭ |    -45    |  -7 |  -2 |\r\n  |  C♯  |    +18    |  +6 |   0 |\r\n  |  C   |     -5    |  -5 |  -2 |\r\n  |  B♯  |    +18    |  +5 |   0 |\r\n  |  B   |    +19    |  +5 |   0 |\r\n  |  B♭ |    -23    | -10 |  -1 |\r\n  |  A♯  |    +18    |  +7 |   0 |\r\n  |  A   |    +13    |  +4 |  +1 |\r\n  |  A♭ |    -71    |  -7 |  -2 |\r\n  |  G♯  |    +17    |  +5 |   0 |\r\n  |  G   |    -14    |   0 |   0 |\r\n  |  F♯♯ |    +44    |  +5 |   0 |\r\n  |  G♭ |    -46    |  -5 |   0 |\r\n  +------+-----------+-----+-----+\r\n\r\nThe sign _plus_ denotes that the degree to which it belongs is to\r\nbe raised, and _minus_, that it is to be depressed. The corrections\r\nin each succeeding operation are to be added to those in the\r\npreceding. The errors, in the 3d approximation, are so trifling,\r\nthat a 4th would be wholly useless.\r\n\r\nNOTE. The foregoing calculations will be rendered much more\r\nexpeditious and sure, by reducing the theorem, in some sense, to a\r\ndiagram, as in the first of the following figures; and by applying\r\nthe successive corrections to the circumference of a circle divided\r\ninto parts proportioned to the intervals of the enharmonic scale,\r\nas in the second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION VII.\r\n\r\n  To determine the temperaments and beats of all the concords,\r\n  together with the values of the diatonic and chromatic intervals,\r\n  and the lengths and vibrations per second of a string producing\r\n  all the sounds, of the system resulting from the last proposition.\r\n\r\nThe temperaments of all the concords are easily deduced from Table\r\nV. The Vth CG, for example, has its lower extremity lowered 12, and\r\nits upper extremity 14. Hence it is flatter by 2 than at first,\r\nand consequently its temperament=156. The temperaments of all the\r\nconcords, thus calculated, will be found in the 2d, 3d, and 4th\r\ncolumns of Table VII.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained the temperaments, the value of the diatonic and\r\nchromatic intervals may be found. The Vth CG being flattened 156,\r\nand the Vth FC 139, the major tone FG must be diminished 156 +\r\n139, or be = 4820. By thus fixing the extent of one interval after\r\nanother, from the temperaments of either of the different kinds of\r\nconcords, as is most convenient, the intervals in question will be\r\nfound to have the values exhibited in Table VI.\r\n\r\nLet the numbers in this table be added successively, beginning at\r\nthe bottom, to the log. of 240, the number of vibrations per second\r\nof the tenor C, (see Rees's Cyc. Art. Concert Pitch,) and the\r\nnumbers corresponding to these logarithms will be the vibrations in\r\na second, of a string sounding the several degrees of the scale.\r\nThey are shown in col. 6, Table VII.\r\n\r\nSince the length of a string cæteris paribus is inversely as its\r\nnumber of vibrations, the lengths in col. 5 may be deduced from\r\nthe vibrations in col. 6; or more expeditiously, by subtracting\r\nthe numerical distances from C of the several degrees in Table VI.\r\nfrom O, and taking the corresponding numbers, from the table of\r\nlogarithms. These numbers, when used as logarithms, must be brought\r\nback to the decimal form, agreeably to Scholium 2. Prop. I.\r\n\r\nTo find the number of beats made in a second by any concord, it\r\nis only necessary to take from col. 5 the numbers belonging to\r\nthe degrees which terminate that concord, and to multiply them\r\ncrosswise into the terms of its perfect ratio. The difference of\r\nthe products will be the number of beats made in a second. The 3\r\nlast columns contain the beats made by each of the concords, in 10\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VI.\r\n\r\n  C  +------+------+------+ C\r\n     | 2998 | 2998 +------+ B♯\r\n     |      |      | 1772 |\r\n  B  +------+------+------+ B\r\n     | 1831 |      | 3033 |\r\n  B♭|------+ 4813 |      |\r\n     |      |      +------+ A♯\r\n     | 2982 |      | 1780 |\r\n  A  +------+------+------+ A\r\n     | 1871 |      | 3030 |\r\n  A♭+------+ 4839 |      |\r\n     |      |      +------+ G♯\r\n     | 2968 |      | 1809 |\r\n  G  +------+------+------+ G\r\n     | 1814 |      +------+ F♯♯\r\n     |      |      | 1798 |\r\n  G♭+------+ 4820 +------+ F♯\r\n     |      |      |      |\r\n     | 3006 |      | 1824 |\r\n  F  +------+------+------+ F\r\n     |      |      +------+ E♯\r\n     | 2988 | 2988 |      |\r\n     |      |      | 1777 |\r\n  E  +------+------+------+ E\r\n     | 1870 |      | 3028 |\r\n     |      |      |      |\r\n  E♭+------+ 4818 |      |\r\n     | 2948 |      +------+ D♯\r\n     |      |      | 1790 |\r\n  D  +------+------+------+ D\r\n     | 1835 |      | 3018 |\r\n  D♭+------+ 4827 |      |\r\n     |      |      +------+ C♯\r\n     | 2992 |      | 1809 |\r\n  C  +------+------+------+ C\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VII.\r\n\r\n  +-----+-------------------++-------+----------++---------------------+\r\n  |     |Temperaments of the||Lengths|Vibrations||Beats in 10 S. of the|\r\n  |Bases+-------------------+|   of  |   in a   |+-------+------+------+\r\n  |     |Vths♭|IIIds♭|3ds♭||String.| Second.  || Vths. |IIIds.| 3ds. |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | B♯  |      |      |  77 || 51431 |  466,64  ||       |      | 43,4 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | B   | 154  |  76  |  93 || 53574 |  447,98  ||  47,4 | 39,0 | 57,8 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | B♭ | 147  |  35  |  97 || 55880 |  429,49  ||  43,5 | 17,7 | 57,4 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | A♯  | 156  |      |  78 || 57448 |  417,77  ||  45,1 |      | 46,2 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | A   | 153  |  71  | 107 || 59852 |  400,99  ||  42,5 | 33,5 | 59,4 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | A♭ | 154  |   9  |     || 62487 |  384,08  ||  40,4 |  4,0 |      |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | G♯  | 151  |  76  |  75 || 64177 |  373,97  ||  39,1 | 32,9 | 39,2 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | G   | 132  |  39  |  97 || 66907 |  358,71  ||  32,9 | 16,3 | 48,1 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | F♯♯ |      |      | 101 || 68778 |  348,95  ||       |      | 48,5 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | G♭ |      |  56  |     || 69760 |  344,03  ||       | 21,9 |      |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | F♯  | 154  |  76  |  83 || 71685 |  334,80  ||  36,0 | 29,2 | 38,5 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | F   | 139  |  32  | 130 || 74760 |  321,03  ||  30,9 | 11,9 | 57,8 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | E♯  | 154  |      |  78 || 76874 |  312,20  ||  33,2 |      | 33,5 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | E   | 149  |  74  | 110 || 80085 |  299,68  ||  30,8 | 25,2 | 45,3 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | E♭ | 110  |  13  |  54 || 83608 |  287,05  ||  21,7 |  4,1 | 21,5 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | D♯  | 154  |  53  |  78 || 85868 |  279,50  ||  29,6 | 17,0 | 30,0 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | D   | 144  |  61  | 112 || 89480 |  268,21  ||  26,5 | 18,5 | 41,1 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | D♭ | 180  |  50  |     || 93342 |  257,12  ||  32,0 | 14,8 |      |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | C♯  | 156  |  78  |  82 || 95920 |  250,20  ||  26,6 | 22,0 | 28,0 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n  | C   | 156  |  46  | 143 ||100000 |  240,00  ||  25,8 | 12,8 | 47,5 |\r\n  +-----+------+------+-----++-------+----------++-------+------+------+\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION VIII.\r\n\r\n  To compare the harmoniousness of the foregoing system with that\r\n  of several others, which have been most known and approved.\r\n\r\nThe aggregate of dissonance, heard in any tempered concord, is as\r\nits temperament (Prop. I.) when its frequency of occurrence is\r\ngiven, and as its frequency of occurrence, when its temperament\r\nis given: hence, universally, it is as the product of both. The\r\nwhole amount of dissonance heard in all the concords of the same\r\nname must consequently be as the sum of the products of the numbers\r\ndenoting their temperaments, each into the number in Table IV.\r\ndenoting its frequency. These products, for the scale of Huygens\r\nwhich divides the octave into 31 equal parts, of which the tone is\r\n5 and the semi-tone 3; for the system of mean tones, and for Dr.\r\nSmith's system of equal harmony, compared with the scale of the\r\nlast proposition, (cutting off the three right-hand figures) stand\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE VIII.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------+---------+------------+-----------+----------+\r\n  |      Systems.      |Huygen's.|Dr. Smith's.|Mean Tones.|New Scale.|\r\n  +--------------------+---------+------------+-----------+----------+\r\n  | Dissonance { Vths  |   825   |     945    |    850    |   786    |\r\n  | of the     { IIIds |   121   |     382    |      0    |   240    |\r\n  |            { 3ds   |  1049   |     629    |    944    |   683    |\r\n  +--------------------+---------+------------+-----------+----------+\r\n  |       Total        |  1995   |    1956    |   1794    |  1709    |\r\n  +--------------------+---------+------------+-----------+----------+\r\n\r\nWere we to adhere to Dr. Smith's measure of equal harmony, the rows\r\nof products belonging to the Vths, IIIds, and 3ds, must be divided,\r\nrespectively, by ⅓, 1/10, and 1/13 (the reciprocals of half the\r\nproducts of the terms of their perfect ratios,) before they could\r\nbe properly added to express the whole amount of dissonance heard\r\nin all the concords; but, according to Prop. I. the simple products\r\nought to be added, and the sums at the bottom of the table will\r\nexpress the true ratio of the aggregate dissonance of the systems\r\nunder which they stand. The last has decidedly the advantage\r\nover the first, both in regard to the aggregate dissonance, and\r\nthe equality of its distribution among the different classes of\r\nconcords. It has nearly an equal advantage over the second in\r\nregard to the first of these considerations; although in regard\r\nto the equality of distribution, the latter has slightly the\r\nadvantage. It has, in a small degree, the advantage over the third,\r\nin regard to the aggregate dissonance; while, as it respects the\r\nequality of its distribution, it has the decided preference. It is\r\ntrue that the temperaments of the concords of the same name, in the\r\nnew scale, are not as in the others, absolutely equal; but no one\r\nof them is so large as to give any offence to the nicest ear. The\r\nlargest in the whole scale exceeds the uniform temperament of Dr.\r\nSmith's Vths by only 1/18 of a comma.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scholium_ 1.\r\n\r\nThe above system may be put in practice on the organ, by making the\r\nsuccessive Vths CG, GD, DE, &c. beat flat at the rate contained in\r\nTable VII., descending an octave, where necessary, and doubling\r\nthe number of beats belonging to any degree in the table, when\r\nthe Vth to be tuned has its base in the octave above the treble\r\nC. The tenor C must first be made to vibrate 240 in a second, the\r\nmethods of doing which are detailed at length in various authors.\r\nWhenever a IIId results from the Vths tuned, its beats ought to be\r\ncompared with those required in the table, and the correctness of\r\nthe Vths thus proved. This system is as easy, in practice, as any\r\nother; for no one can be tuned correctly except by counting the\r\nbeats, and rendering them conformable to what that system requires.\r\nThe intervals of the first octave tuned ought to be adjusted with\r\nthe utmost accuracy, by a table of beats. When this is done, the\r\nlabour of making perfect the other octaves of the same stop, and\r\nthe unisons, octaves, Vths, &c. of the other stops, is the same\r\nin every system. This last, indeed, is so much the most laborious\r\npart of the tuning of the organ, that if even much more labour\r\nwere required than actually is, in adjusting the intervals of the\r\noctave first tuned it would occasion little difference in the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scholium_ 2.\r\n\r\nThe harmony of the IIIds and 3ds in any of the foregoing systems\r\nfor the changeable scale is so much finer than it can possibly be\r\nin the common Douzeave, that it seems highly desirable that this\r\nscale should be introduced into general use. But the increased bulk\r\nand expense attendant on the introduction of so many new pipes or\r\nstrings, together with the trouble occasioned to the performer, in\r\nrectifying the scale for music in the different keys, have hitherto\r\nprevented its becoming generally adopted. To multiply the number\r\nof finger keys would render execution on the instrument extremely\r\ndifficult; and the apparatus necessary for transferring the action\r\nof the same key from one string or set of pipes to another, besides\r\nbeing complicated and expensive, requires such exactness that\r\nit must be continually liable to get out of order. This latter\r\nexpedient, however, has been deemed the only practicable one,\r\nand has been carried into effect, under different forms, by Dr.\r\nSmith, Mr. Hawkes, M. Loeschman, and others. But Dr. Smith's plan\r\n(which is confined to stringed instruments) requires only one of\r\nthe unisons to be used at once; while those of the two latter\r\nnearly double the whole number of strings or pipes. It deserves an\r\nexperiment, among the makers of imperfect instruments, whether a\r\nchangeable scale cannot be rendered practicable, at least on the\r\npiano forte,[26] without increasing the number of strings, and at\r\nthe same time allowing both the unisons to be used together--either\r\nby an apparatus for slightly increasing the tension of the strings,\r\nor by one which shall intercept the vibrations of such a part of\r\nthe string, at its extremity, as shall elevate its tone, by the\r\ndiesis of the system of temperament adopted. Were only 4 degrees to\r\nthe octave, furnishing the instrument with 5 sharps and 4 flats,\r\nthus rendered changeable, there is little music which could not be\r\ncorrectly executed upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scholium_ 3.\r\n\r\nIn the same general manner, may be found the best system of\r\nintervals, for a scale confined to a less number of degrees than\r\nthat of the complete Enharmonic scale. In such an investigation,\r\nthe numbers in Table IV. expressing the frequency of all such\r\nadjacent degrees as have but one sound in the given scale, must be\r\nunited; and the temperaments _m_, _n_, &c. of the theorem, when\r\nbelonging to concords whose terminating degrees are united to\r\nthose adjacent, must be taken, not what they were in the complete\r\nscale, but what they become, considering them as terminated by the\r\nsubstituted adjacent degree.\r\n\r\nIf, for example, the best temperaments were required for a scale of\r\n15 degrees to the octave, such as is that of some European organs,\r\nor in other words, having no Enharmonic intervals except D♯ E♭,\r\nand G♯ A♭,--the numbers in Table IV. belonging to C♯ and D♭, E♯\r\nand F, F♯ and G♭, &c. must be united, and their sums substituted\r\nwhen they occur, for _a_, _a′_, _b_, &c. in the theorem; while the\r\ntemperament, for example, of the IIId on C♯ must not be reckoned\r\n77 as in the complete scale, but 1261 - 77 sharp, since its upper\r\ntermination has become F, instead of E♯. With these variations let\r\nthe same theorem be applied as before, till no value of _x_ can\r\nbe obtained, and the temperaments for that scale will be the best\r\nadjusted possible.\r\n\r\nBut as the scale which contains but 13 degrees, or 12 intervals, to\r\nthe octave, is in much more general use than every other, we shall\r\ncontent ourselves with stating _how_ the problem may be solved for\r\nscales containing any intermediate number of degrees, and proceed\r\ndirectly to the consideration of that which is so much the most\r\npractically important.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEMMA.\r\n\r\n  No arrangement of the intervals in the common scale of 12\r\n  degrees, which renders none of the Vths or 3ds sharp, and none of\r\n  the IIIds flat, can make any change in the aggregate temperaments\r\n  of all the concords of the same name.\r\n\r\nWe will conceive the 12 Vths of the Douzeave scale to be arranged\r\nin succession, as CG, GD, DA, &c. embracing 7 octaves. Let them\r\nat first be all equal: they will each be flattened 49. I say that\r\nno change in these Vths which preserves the two extreme octaves\r\nperfect, and renders none of them sharp, can alter the sum of their\r\ntemperaments. Let _a_, _b_, _c_, &c. be any quantities, positive\r\nor negative, by which the points C, G, D, &c. may be conceived to\r\nbe raised above the corresponding points, belonging to the scheme\r\nof equal Vths. Then as the mean temperament Vth = V - 49, the\r\nfirst Vth in the supposed arrangement will be V - 49 + _a_. The\r\ndistance from C to D will be, in like manner, 2 · (V - 49) + _b_;\r\nand consequently the Vth GD will be V - 49 + _b_ - _a_. In the same\r\nmanner the third Vth DE will be V - 49 + _c_ - _b_, &c. Hence the\r\ntemperament of CG = -49 + _a_, of GD = -49 + _b_ - _a_, of DA = -49\r\n+ _c_ - _b_, &c. Adding the 12 temperaments together, we find their\r\nsum\r\n\r\n  = -12 × 49 + a + b + &c. - a - b - &c.\r\n\r\nin which all the terms except the first destroy each other, and\r\nleave their sum = -12 × 49 which is the aggregate temperament of\r\nthe twelve equal Vths in the scheme of equal semitones.\r\n\r\nThe same reasoning holds good if we bring these Vths within the\r\ncompass of an octave; since, if the octave be kept perfect, all\r\nthe Vths on the same letter, in whatever octave they are situated,\r\nmust have the same temperament.\r\n\r\nThe reasoning is precisely the same for the IIIds and 3ds,\r\nconsidering the former as forming 4 distinct series of an octave\r\neach, beginning with C, C♯, D and E♭; and the latter as forming 3\r\ndistinct series of an octave each, beginning with C, C♯ and D. If\r\nthe former be made all equal, each will be sharpened 343; if the\r\nlatter be made equal, each will be flattened 392. In every system\r\nwhich renders none of the former flat, and none of the latter\r\nsharp, the sum of their temperaments will be 12 × 343, and 12 ×\r\n392, respectively.\r\n\r\n_Cor._ The demonstration holds equally true, whatever be the\r\nmagnitude of _a_, _b_, _c_, &c.: only if they be such that the\r\ndifference -_a_ + _b_, -_b_ + _c_, &c. of any two successive ones\r\nbe greater than the temperament of the corresponding concord in\r\nthe system of equal semitones, the temperament of that chord must\r\nbe reckoned negative, and the _sum_, in the enunciation of the\r\nproposition, must be considered as the excess of those temperaments\r\nwhich have the same sign with those of the same concords in the\r\nsystem of equal semitones, above those which have the contrary\r\nsign. Hence it is universally true that the excess of the flat\r\nabove the sharp temperaments of the Vths is equal to 12 × 49; that\r\nthe excess of the sharp above the flat temperaments of the IIIds\r\nis equal to 12 × 343; and that the excess of the flat above the\r\nsharp temperaments of the 3ds is 12 × 392. Hence likewise we have a\r\nvery easy method of _proving_ whether the temperaments of any given\r\nsystem have been correctly calculated. It is only to add those\r\nwhich have the same sign; and if the differences of the sums be\r\nequal to the products just stated, the work is right.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION IX.\r\n\r\n  If all the concords of the same name, in a scale of twelve\r\n  intervals to the octave, were of equally frequent occurrence, the\r\n  best system of temperament would be that of equal semitones.\r\n\r\nIt is evidently best, so far as the concords of the same name\r\nare concerned, that if of equal frequency, they should be\r\nequally tempered, unless by rendering them unequal, their medium\r\ntemperament could be diminished; but this appears, from the Lemma,\r\nto be impossible. By tempering them unequally, the aggregate\r\ndissonance heard in a given time, by supposition of their equal\r\nfrequency, would not be diminished, whilst the disadvantage of a\r\ntransition from a better to a worse harmony would be incurred.\r\nSome advocates of irregular systems of temperament have, indeed,\r\nmaintained this irregularity to be a positive advantage, as giving\r\nvariety of character to the different keys. But this variety\r\nof character is obviously neither more nor less than that of\r\ngreater and less degrees of dissonance. Now, what performer on a\r\nperfect instrument ever struck his intervals false, for the sake\r\nof variety? Who was ever gratified by the variety produced in\r\nvocal music by a voice slightly out of tune? If this be absurd,\r\nwhen applied to instruments capable of perfect harmony, it is\r\nscarcely less so to urge variety of character as being of itself\r\na sufficient ground for introducing large temperaments into the\r\nscale. For these large temperaments will have nearly the same\r\neffect, compared with the smaller ones, that small temperaments\r\nwould have, when compared with the perfect harmony of voices and\r\nperfect instruments. Possibly a discordant interval, or a concord\r\nlargely tempered, might, in a few instances, add to the resources\r\nof the composer. But when an instrument is once tuned, the\r\nsituation of these intervals is fixed beyond his control, and by\r\noccurring in a passage where his design required the most perfect\r\nharmony, it might as often thwart as favour the intended effect.\r\n\r\nSince, then, the proposition is true in reference to the Vths,\r\nIIIds, and 3ds, when separately considered, it will be equally true\r\nwhen they are considered jointly, that is, as formed into harmonic\r\ntriads, unless, by rendering the concords of the same name unequal\r\nin their temperament, the mean temperament of the Vths could be\r\nincreased, and that of the IIIds and 3ds proportionally diminished.\r\nCould this be done, it might be a question whether the more equal\r\ndistribution of the temperament among the concords of different\r\nnames, might not justify the introduction of some inequality among\r\nthose of the same name. But it is demonstrated in the Lemma, that\r\nthe sum of the temperaments of each parcel of concords, in the\r\nsystem of equal semitones, is the least possible. Hence no changes\r\nin the Vths can diminish the average temperaments of the IIIds and\r\n3ds.\r\n\r\n_Cor._ Hence we derive an important practical conclusion: that\r\nwhatever irregularities are introduced into the scale, must be\r\nsuch as are demanded by the different frequency of occurrence of\r\nthe several concords. If we make any alterations in the scale of\r\nequal semitones, this must be our sole criterion. A given system\r\nof temperament is eligible, in proportion to the accuracy with\r\nwhich it is deduced from the different frequency of the different\r\nconcords. And those who maintain that the frequency of different\r\nintervals does not sensibly vary, or that it is of such a nature\r\nas not to be susceptible of calculation, must, to be consistent,\r\nadhere to the scale of equal semitones.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION X.\r\n\r\n  To determine the best distribution of the temperaments of the\r\n  concords in the Douzeave Scale.\r\n\r\nAs the scale of equal semitones has been demonstrated to be the\r\nbest, on supposition that all the concords of the same name\r\noccurred equally often, it ought to be made the standard from\r\nwhich all the variations, required by their unequal frequency, are\r\nto be reckoned. To find a set of numbers expressing the relative\r\nfrequency of the several concords in the common scale, we have only\r\nto unite the numbers in Table IV. standing against those adjacent\r\ndegrees which have but one sound in this scale. They will then\r\nstand as in the following table:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE IX.\r\n\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  |      | Vths, 4ths,| IIIds, 6ths,| 3ds, VIths,|\r\n  |Bases.|    and     |    and      |    and     |\r\n  |      |  Octaves.  |  Octaves.   |  Octaves.  |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | B    |    221     |    135      |   1161     |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | B♭  |    418     |    654      |     34     |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | A    |    870     |    568      |   1085     |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | G♯   |     57     |     82      |    365⅕    |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | G    |   1207     |   1197      |    567¼    |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | F♯   |     67     |     29½     |   1072     |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | F    |    639     |    924      |     78     |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | E    |    548     |    323      |   1151     |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | E♭  |    265⅓    |    363½     |    144½    |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | D    |   1166     |    943      |    569     |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | C♯   |     26     |     18      |    581     |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n  | C    |    816     |   1131      |    184     |\r\n  +------+------------+-------------+------------+\r\n\r\nThe general theorem of Prop. V. is equally applicable to the\r\ndetermination of the approximate place for any degree in this\r\nscale, considering the numbers in the above table as those to be\r\nsubstituted for _a_, _a′_, _b_, &c.; and _m_, _n_, and _p_, in the\r\nfirst instance, as 49, -343 and 392, the uniform temperaments of\r\nthe Vths, IIIds, and 3ds, in the scale of equal semitones. Since,\r\nhowever, the temperaments of the IIIds in this scale are sharp,\r\nwhich would require the signs of the 3d and 4th terms in the\r\nnumerator of the general formula to be continually changed, it will\r\nbe rendered more convenient for practice, if they are changed at\r\nfirst, so that it will stand thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n  x = (am - a′m′ - bn + b′n′ + cp - c′p′) /\r\n            (a + a′ + b + b′ + c + c′)\r\n\r\nThree successive applications of this theorem to each degree in\r\nthe scale, in the manner described Prop.

These are\r\nderived from the perfect ratio 6 : 7, because these 3ds are, in\r\nreality, much nearer to the ratio of 6 : 7 than to that of 5 : 6;\r\nand hence could their beats be counted, they would be those of\r\nthe table, and not those which would be derived from considering\r\nthese 3ds as having flat temperaments of the ratio 5 : 6. But\r\nalthough the beats are slower, the nearer they approach the ratio\r\n6 : 7, this ought not to be regarded as any sufficient reason\r\nfor admitting so large temperaments into the scale, were it not\r\nabsolutely necessary, in order to accommodate those 3ds which are\r\nof far more frequent occurrence. Although the beats of these 3ds\r\ngrow slower as their temperaments are increased, yet they are\r\nlosing their character in melody; and become, in this respect, more\r\nand more offensive, the more they are tempered. Hence the harmony\r\nand melody of the several intervals, jointly considered, are to\r\nbe judged of rather from their temperaments, in the three first\r\ncolumns, than from their beats, in the three last.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scholium_ 1.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived, from a comparison of the temperaments in\r\nTable XII. with the corresponding numbers in Table IX., that the\r\nharshness of the several concords, especially of the IIIds and 3ds,\r\nis, in general, nearly in the inverse ratio of their frequency. The\r\ncontending claims of the different concords render it impossible\r\nthat this ratio should hold exactly. Including the Vths, the\r\nharmony of the concords is much more nearly _equal_, than the\r\nprinciple of rendering the temperament of each inversely as its\r\nfrequency, could it be carried into complete effect, would require.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scholium_ 2.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing system may be put in practice, on the organ, by\r\nmaking the Vths beat flat, with the exception of those on C♯,\r\nE♭, and G♯, which must beat sharp, at the rate required in the\r\ntable; proving the correctness of the temperaments of the Vths, by\r\ncomparing the beats of the IIIds, as they rise, with those required\r\nby column two. Should less accuracy be required, the IIIds on C,\r\nD, and A, might be made perfect, without producing any essential\r\nchange in the system. This would reduce the labour of counting the\r\nbeats to eight degrees only.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scholium_ 3.\r\n\r\nTo show that the computations of the different frequency of\r\noccurrence of the different concords, on which this system of\r\ntemperament is founded, may be relied on as practically correct,\r\nfor music in general, it may be proper to state, that a similar\r\nseries of calculations had been before made, from an enumeration\r\nof the concords in fifty scores of music entirely different from\r\nthat made use of in Prop. IV. They were not, indeed, made with the\r\nsame accuracy, for the music of which the chords were counted, was\r\ntoo generally of the simpler kind, and the numbers corresponding to\r\nthose in the two columns under each concord in Table II., and those\r\nbelonging to the major and to the minor signatures, corresponding\r\nto the numbers in Table III., were added, before the products were\r\ntaken, instead of keeping the modes distinct, which is necessary\r\nto perfect accuracy. Yet the resulting scheme of temperament was\r\nessentially the same throughout, with the one which has been just\r\ndescribed. It had the same anomalous temperaments, viz. the Vths on\r\nC♯, E♭, and G♯; and the IIId on A; and these anomalies were similar\r\nin degree. The greatest difference between any two corresponding\r\ntemperaments, was between those of the 3d on E♭; the first\r\ncomputation making it only 702, while the last has it 818.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPOSITION XI.\r\n\r\n  The aggregate of dissonance, heard in a given time, in the system\r\n  of temperament unfolded in the last Proposition, will be less\r\n  than in either of the systems generally practised.\r\n\r\nIn order to compare the foregoing system with those which have been\r\nmost generally approved, the temperaments of all the concords have\r\nbeen calculated, in the system of equal semitones; in that of Earl\r\nStanhope, which has had considerable celebrity; in that of Dr. T.\r\nYoung; in that of Mr. Hawkes; in that of Kirnberger, which has been\r\nextensively adopted in Germany; and in that which is described by\r\nRousseau and D'Alembert as generally practised in France. If these\r\ntemperaments be multiplied into the corresponding numbers of Table\r\nIX., agreeably to what was shown under Prop. VIII., and those\r\nproducts which belong to the several concords of the same name be\r\nadded, the sums, after the three right-hand figures are cut off,\r\nwill be as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE XIII.\r\n\r\n  +-------------+------+--------+--------+-------+-------+--------+------+\r\n  |  Systems.   | Mean |Young's.|Kirnber-|French.| Stan- |Hawkes'.| New  |\r\n  |             | Temp.|        | ger's. |       |hope's.|        |Scale.|\r\n  +-------------+------+--------+--------+-------+-------+--------+------+\r\n  |Dissonance of|      |        |        |       |       |        |      |\r\n  | the  { Vths |  309 |   494  |   681  |   561 |   595 |   665  |  810 |\r\n  |      { IIIds| 2184 |  1541  |  1397  |  1346 |  1175 |   925  |  530 |\r\n  |      { 3ds  | 2740 |  2448  |  2019  |  2121 |  1992 |  1676  | 1363 |\r\n  +-------------+------+--------+--------+-------+-------+--------+------+\r\n  |   Total     | 5233 |  4483  |  4097  |  4028 |  3762 |  3266  | 2703 |\r\n  +-------------+------+--------+--------+-------+-------+--------+------+\r\n\r\nFrom an inspection of the sums at the foot of the table, it will\r\nbe seen that the amount of dissonance heard in a given time is\r\ndecidedly less in the new scale than in either of the others;\r\nand that it is scarcely more than half as great as in the scale\r\nof equal semitones. On the other hand, the temperament is very\r\nunequally distributed, which must be admitted, cæteris paribus,\r\nto be a disadvantage. It is even somewhat greater than in the\r\nscheme of Mr. Hawkes, although by no means in the same ratio, as\r\nthe aggregate dissonance is less. It contains one Vth, which will\r\nbe somewhat harsh, and four IIIds and three 3ds, which will be\r\nquite harsh. But these, as will appear from an inspection of Table\r\nIX., are, of all others, of by far the most unfrequent occurrence;\r\nso that the unpleasant effect of a transition from a better to a\r\nmuch worse harmony will be very seldom felt. In the six simplest\r\nkeys of the major, and in the three of most frequent occurrence\r\nin the minor mode, they are _never_ heard, except in occasional\r\nmodulations; and even then, generally no one, and rarely more than\r\none is heard. Now these nine keys, as will appear from Table III.,\r\ncomprise more than five times as much of the music examined as all\r\nthe rest. The same remarks might be extended to three other minor\r\nkeys, were it not that the sharp seventh is so generally used, that\r\nit deserves to be considered as an essential note of the key.\r\n\r\nBut there are two important considerations, more than\r\ncounterbalancing the objection to this system, derived from the\r\ngreater inequality in the distribution of its temperaments,\r\nwhich have not been hitherto noticed, as not being susceptible of\r\nmathematical computation.\r\n\r\n1st. We have gone on the supposition that tunes on the more\r\ndifficult keys are as often performed, according to their number,\r\nas those on the simpler keys; and have taken for the measure of\r\ndissonance, in different systems, what would be actually heard, if\r\nthe 1600 scores, whose signatures were examined, were all played\r\nin succession, and on the keys to which they are set. But the fact\r\nis, that those pieces which are set to the simpler keys are oftener\r\nplayed, and with fuller harmony, on account of the greater ease of\r\nexecution, than those in which many of the short finger keys must\r\nbe used.\r\n\r\n2d. Pieces on the more difficult keys are often played on the\r\nadjacent easier keys, but the contrary is seldom or never done.\r\n\r\nGiving to these two considerations no more than a reasonable\r\nweight, they will counterbalance the objection, and will render it\r\nevident that the sums under the several systems in the table may be\r\ntaken as a true exhibition of their respective merits, without any\r\ninjustice to the more equal systems at the left-hand of the table.\r\n\r\n_Cor._ We may hence draw a comparison between the systems in common\r\nuse. Their merits, when every consideration is taken into view, are\r\nnearly in the inverse ratio of the sums denoting their aggregate\r\ndissonance. That of Mr. Hawkes is the best, and, in many respects,\r\nhas a remarkable analogy to the one derived from the preceding\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n_Cor._ 2. As the aggregate dissonance of the changeable scale is\r\ncalculated on the same principles, in Prop. VIII., as that of the\r\nDouzeave in this, a comparison of the results in Table VIII. with\r\nthose in Table XIII., will furnish us with the relative dissonance\r\nof different systems for these different scales. The relative\r\ndissonance of the two systems which form the object of this essay,\r\nis nearly as 17 : 27. Hence it appears, that by inserting eight\r\nnew sounds between those of the common octave, the harshness of\r\nthe music executed, at a medium of all the keys, may be diminished\r\nby more than one third of the whole, while the transition from a\r\nbetter to a worse harmony will never be perceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XXII. _Notice of Colonel Trumbull's Picture of the Declaration\r\nof Independence._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is proper that some mention of this great national work should\r\nbe made, in publications less transient than newspapers; and as the\r\nfine arts are included within the design of this Journal, it may\r\nwith propriety be noticed here. This is the greatest work which the\r\nart of painting has ever produced in the United States. The picture\r\nis magnificent both in size and in execution. The dimensions of the\r\ncanvass are eighteen feet by twelve.\r\n\r\n\"This picture forms one of a series long since meditated by Mr.\r\nTrumbull, in which it was intended to represent the most important\r\nevents, civil and military, of the American revolution, with\r\nportraits of the most distinguished actors in the various scenes.\r\nThe materials for this purpose were collected many years ago, and\r\ntwo plates have been engraved from paintings of the deaths of Gen.\r\nWarren and Gen. Montgomery;[27] but the work was suspended, in\r\nconsequence of the political convulsions, which, during twenty-five\r\nyears, were so fatal to the arts of peace.\r\n\r\n\"The government of the United States have ordered four of the\r\nsubjects originally proposed by Mr. Trumbull, to be painted by him,\r\nand to be deposited in the capitol.\r\n\r\n\"No event in human history ever shed a more salutary influence\r\nover the destinies of so great a mass of mankind: the wisdom of no\r\npolitical act was ever so soon and so powerfully demonstrated, by\r\nsuch magnificent consequences. And justly may the nation be proud\r\nof the act itself; and of those eminent men, its authors, whose\r\npatriotism (rising above enthusiasm, and the passions which have\r\nso often bewildered mankind) was calm, dignified, persevering, and\r\nalways under the guidance of reason and virtue.\r\n\r\n\"The painting represents the congress at the moment when the\r\ncommittee advance to the table of the president to make their\r\nreport.\r\n\r\n\"It contains faithful portraits of all those members who were\r\nliving when the picture was begun, and of all others of whom any\r\nauthentic representation could be obtained. Of a small number, no\r\ntrace could be discovered; and nothing was admitted which was not\r\nauthentic.\"\r\n\r\nThis picture is now, by permission of government, exhibited in the\r\nAcademy of Arts in New-York, and will probably be shown in some of\r\nour other principal cities, before it receives its final location\r\nat Washington.\r\n\r\nIt exhibits the interior of the then Congress Hall at Philadelphia.\r\nMost of the members are represented as sitting in their respective\r\nchairs, or, in various instances, as standing in different parts of\r\nthe room. Almost all the portraits were taken by Colonel Trumbull\r\n_from the living men_, and their accuracy may therefore be relied\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe president, John Hancock, sitting at a table, and elevated\r\nsomewhat by a low platform, is receiving the report of the\r\ncommittee declaring the independence of the colonies; that\r\ncommittee, individually illustrious, and in this august transaction\r\ncollectively memorable, was composed of Franklin, Adams, Sherman,\r\nJefferson, and Livingston. Mr. Jefferson, in the prime of life, is\r\nin the act of laying upon the table the great charter of a nation's\r\nliberties; while his companions support him by their silent but\r\ndignified presence, and the venerable Franklin, in particular,\r\nimposes new obligations on his country's gratitude.\r\n\r\nThe figures are as large as the life; and it may safely be said,\r\nthat the world never beheld, on a similar occasion, a more noble\r\nassemblage. It was the native and unchartered nobility of great\r\ntalent, cultivated intelligence, superior manners, high moral aim,\r\nand devoted patriotism. The crisis demanded the utmost firmness of\r\nwhich the human mind is capable--a firmness not produced, for the\r\nmoment, by passion and enthusiasm, but resting on the most able\r\ncomprehension of both duties and dangers, and on a _principled_\r\ndetermination to combat the one and to fulfil the other.\r\n\r\nThis moral effect has been produced in the fullest and finest\r\nmanner by this great painter; and no true American can contemplate\r\nthis picture without gratitude to the men who, under God, asserted\r\nhis liberties, and to the artist who has commemorated the event,\r\nand transmitted the very features and persons of the actors to\r\nposterity. Such efforts of the pencil tend powerfully also to\r\ninvigorate patriotism, and to prompt the rising generation to\r\nemulate such glorious examples.\r\n\r\nThe composition and execution in this picture are in a masterly\r\nstyle. The grouping of so many full length portraits, in a scene\r\nin which there could scarcely be any action, and in such a manner\r\nas to dispose of them without monotony, was an attainment of no\r\nsmall difficulty. The painter could not even avail himself of\r\nthe adventitious relief of splendid costume and furniture, and\r\nof magnificence or rich decorations in architecture; for on this\r\noccasion both were characterized by an elegant simplicity only,\r\nsuch however as became the actors and the crisis.\r\n\r\nThe composition has all the variety of which it is susceptible; and\r\nthere is also enough of it in the style of dress and of features to\r\nrelieve the eye from any danger of satiety.\r\n\r\nIt is believed, that in this picture, the United States possess\r\na treasure to which there is no parallel in the world. In no\r\ninstance, within our knowledge, is there an exhibition to an\r\nequal extent, of the actual portraits of an illustrious assembly,\r\nconcerned in so momentous a transaction.\r\n\r\nIt was a great thing to assert, _in principle_, the liberties of\r\nthis country; but it was also a great thing to vindicate them by\r\narms; and we rejoice that Colonel Trumbull is still to proceed,\r\nunder the sanction of government, to delineate other scenes, in\r\nwhich Washington and his illustrious American coadjutors, and the\r\nflower of French chivalry, were the actors. In the maturity of his\r\nexperience, skill, and fame--possessed, as he is, of the portraits\r\nof most of the great men of that period, taken principally from the\r\nlife, and having been himself largely and personally conversant\r\nwith them in their great deeds, we trust that the government will\r\npromptly second what we doubt not the united voice of the nation\r\nwill demand--that the illustrious artist should dedicate the\r\nevening of his life to his country's honour and glory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTELLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XXIII. _An Address to the People of the Western Country._\r\n\r\n\r\nA number of the citizens of Cincinnati have recently instituted\r\na society for the collection, preservation, exhibition, and\r\nillustration of natural and artificial curiosities, particularly\r\nthose of the _western country_. The first efforts of the managers\r\nwill be directed to the establishment of a permanent museum, on\r\na scale so comprehensive as to receive specimens of every thing\r\ncurious which they may be able to procure. In attempting to form\r\nthis repository, they must of course solicit the aid of their\r\nfellow-citizens in all quarters of the extensive region, whose\r\nancient works and natural history they propose to illustrate. The\r\nfollowing are the classes of objects that will especially attract\r\ntheir attention, and to which they are desirous, at an early\r\nperiod, of directing the views of the community:\r\n\r\n1. Our metals and minerals generally, including petrifactions.\r\n\r\n2. Our indigenous animals, embracing the remains of those which are\r\nnow extinct.\r\n\r\n3. The relics of the unknown people who constructed the ancient\r\nworks of the western country.\r\n\r\n4. The various articles manufactured, for ornament or use, by the\r\npresent savage tribes.\r\n\r\nThe subjects of the first class are considered by the Society\r\nas extremely interesting. Every citizen of the western country\r\nmust _feel_ the necessity of a speedy developement of its mineral\r\nresources. To find beneath our own soil an adequate supply of the\r\nvarious minerals which are now imported at an enormous expense,\r\nmust be regarded by all as a matter of the first and greatest\r\nimportance. The managers are anxious to be instrumental in the\r\nadvancement of this useful work, and earnestly solicit the\r\nco-operation of the public. They will be thankful for specimens of\r\nall the rare or curious minerals that may be discovered in this\r\ncountry. To every specimen that may be transmitted, a label should\r\nbe attached, stating either the kind of rock or stratum to which\r\nit belonged, or its precise locality. Whenever it is required, the\r\nmanagers will have a part of any specimen which is sent to them,\r\nanalyzed, and a correct report made of its nature, thus affording\r\nto the discoverer a full opportunity of availing himself of all the\r\npecuniary advantages that may attend the discovery.\r\n\r\nAs objects of scientific interest, the managers intend, as early as\r\npossible, to commence the formation of a cabinet of petrifactions.\r\nThe rocks of few other countries contain a greater number and\r\nvariety of these animal remains of the ancient ocean, than the\r\nlimestone districts of the Ohio and Mississippi. They both astonish\r\nand confound most of the travellers through this region; and\r\nalthough objects of familiar examination to ourselves, they have\r\nnot been collected or described by our citizens. An extensive and\r\nwell arranged cabinet of these extraneous fossils would afford,\r\nboth to the zoologist and geologist, an exquisite feast. It is\r\nhoped that every specimen sent to the Society will be accompanied\r\nby a label, stating the place where it was found.\r\n\r\nIt is the wish of the Society to obtain and preserve specimens\r\nof all the native animals of this country. Most of the larger\r\nquadrupeds having receded before the unceasing extension of our\r\nsettlements, are now so rare as to be unknown to all but our\r\noldest emigrants. Measures will be taken by the managers to procure\r\nfrom the general retreat in the northwest, and exhibit to the\r\npeople in the Ohio countries, a specimen of every quadruped which\r\nlately inhabited them; and while engaged in this enterprise, they\r\nhope to import from the same distant wilderness, a variety of the\r\nanimals which are peculiar to it.\r\n\r\nOur native birds have not retreated, like our quadrupeds, and are,\r\ntherefore, within our reach. The managers hope to see the Society,\r\nin due time, in possession of a large collection of these beautiful\r\nanimals. In the accomplishment of this undertaking, it is easy to\r\nperceive that the Society may be powerfully aided by the community:\r\nand a sanguine hope is entertained, that no backwardness or\r\nindifference will be manifested by those who may fortunately have\r\nit in their power to forward specimens.\r\n\r\nIn collecting the fishes and reptiles of the Ohio, the Mississippi,\r\nand the Lakes, the managers will likewise need all the aid which\r\ntheir fellow-citizens may feel disposed to give them. Although not\r\na very interesting department of zoology, no object of the Society\r\noffers so great a prospect of novelty as that which embraces these\r\nanimals. The managers, therefore, flatter themselves that they will\r\nnot be suffered to proceed unaided in this portion of their labours.\r\n\r\nThe obscure and neglected race of insects will not be overlooked,\r\nand any specimens sufficiently perfect to be introduced into a\r\ncabinet of entomology, will be thankfully received.\r\n\r\nThe western country, from having afforded some of the most gigantic\r\nand curious remains of land animals which have yet been discovered,\r\nseems entitled to a museum of such relics. A collection of this\r\nkind will be one of the earliest objects of the Society. Its funds\r\nwill be liberally expended for the purpose; and if aided by those\r\nwho may be so fortunate as to discover any of the great bones which\r\nlie buried in our alluvial or bottom lands, the managers hope, at\r\nno distant period, to repair, in some degree, the losses which\r\nhave been repeatedly sustained by exportation of these interesting\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\nThe third class comprises objects of very little utility, but\r\nof extraordinary interest. Nothing, indeed, presented by the\r\nwestern country seems to excite in a higher degree the curiosity\r\nof strangers, than the relics and vestiges of the extinct and\r\ncomparatively civilized population with which it abounds.\r\n\r\nThe managers will make every possible effort to form an extensive\r\ncollection of these remains.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely unfortunate for those engaged in researches\r\nconcerning the objects of this class, that so many of them have\r\nbeen disseminated abroad. To study them successfully, it is\r\nnecessary that they should be compared, and for this purpose they\r\nmust be brought together. The managers hope, therefore, that\r\nsuch persons as now hold, or may hereafter possess any of these\r\nantiquities, will dispose of them to the Society, instead of\r\nsending them out of the country. In this way, and in this only, can\r\na valuable collection of these unique curiosities be formed.\r\n\r\nThe remaining class comprehends the weapons, utensils, trinkets,\r\nand other manufactures of our neighbouring Indians, of which the\r\nmanagers hope, in a short time, to be able to exhibit a great\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\nThe curiosities of this country are the primary, but not the\r\nexclusive objects of the Society. It proposes in due time to open a\r\ngallery of paintings, and thus offer to the lovers and cultivators\r\nof the fine arts, a few of those models which are absolutely\r\nnecessary to the gratification and improvement of their taste.\r\n\r\nThe managers will be happy, moreover, to receive from such of\r\ntheir eastern brethren as are desirous of contributing to the\r\namelioration and advancement of a new and remote community, any\r\nof the productions of foreign countries that may be calculated to\r\npromote this object; and will, in return, cheerfully exchange any\r\nspecimens of the curiosities of this country which they can spare\r\nwithout injury to their collection.\r\n\r\nThey will, if required, pay a reasonable price for every article\r\nwhich may be deemed worthy of introduction into the museum. They\r\nintend to publish, annually, a catalogue of all the more valuable\r\ndonations which may be made to the museum, with the names of the\r\ndonors.\r\n\r\n  ELIJAH SLACK,   }\r\n  JAMES FINDLAY,  }\r\n  WILLIAM STEELE, } _Managers_.\r\n  JESSE EMBREE,   }\r\n  DANIEL DRAKE,   }\r\n\r\n_Cincinnati, Sept. 15, 1818._\r\n\r\nCaleb Atwater, Esq. of Circleville, Ohio, is engaged in writing\r\nNotes on the State of Ohio, a work which is intended to embrace the\r\nmost important features and interests of this new and rising State.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this laudable effort, and to that of the Western Museum Society,\r\nwhose address is published above, we cordially wish success. From\r\nthe zeal, talent, and industry of the gentlemen concerned, we have\r\nevery reason to expect a happy result.\r\n\r\nWe view, with much satisfaction, the efforts which have been\r\nalready made, and are rapidly increasing, to bring to light the\r\nresources, and to develope the history, of the western States; and\r\nit will always give us pleasure, if through the medium of this\r\nJournal, or in any other manner, we can contribute to promote them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XXIV. _Extract of a Letter from Colonel Gibbs to the Editor._\r\n\r\n\r\n  SUNSWICK, June, 1818.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nSince I saw you, I have made only one experiment on magnetism. I\r\ndetermined the power of my magnet, as it had been shut up in the\r\ndark for a long time, and lying down. I then exposed it to the rays\r\nof the sun, also lying down, and remote from the iron support, and\r\nI found that it had gained 12 oz. power in 40 minutes, and 14 oz.\r\npower only in five hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XXV. _A New Lamp, without Flame._\r\n\r\nFrom the Annals of Philosophy for March, 1818. Communicated by Mr.\r\nTHOMAS GILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis lamp is one of the results of the new discoveries in\r\nchemistry. It has been found, by Sir H. Davy, that a fine platina\r\nwire, heated red hot, and held in the vapour of ether, would\r\ncontinue ignited for some time; but, I believe, no practical use\r\nhas been made of this fact.\r\n\r\nIf a cylindrical coil of thin platina wire be placed, part of it\r\nround the cotton wick of a spirit lamp, and part of it above the\r\nwick, and the lamp be lighted, so as to heat the wire to redness;\r\non the flame being blown out, the vapour of the alcohol will keep\r\nthe upper part of the wire _red hot_, for any length of time,\r\naccording to the supply of alcohol, and with little expenditure\r\nthereof; so as to be in constant readiness to kindle German\r\nfungus, or paper prepared with nitre, and, by this means, to light\r\na sulphur match at pleasure. This lamp affords sufficient light\r\nto show the hour of the night by a watch, and to perform many\r\nother useful services; but does not hinder the repose of persons\r\nunaccustomed to keep a light burning in their bed-room, nor does it\r\nrequire to be snuffed.\r\n\r\nThe proper size of the platina wire is the 1/100th part of an inch:\r\na larger one will only yield a dull, red light, and a smaller one\r\nis difficult to use. About 12 turns of the wire will be sufficient,\r\ncoiled around any cylindrical body suited to the size of the wick\r\nof the lamp; and four or five coils should be placed on the wick,\r\nand the remainder of the wire above it; and which will be the part\r\nignited. A wick, composed of twelve threads of the ordinary sized\r\nlamp cotton yarn, with the platina wire coiled around it, will\r\nrequire about half an ounce of alcohol to keep it alight for eight\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nAn agreeable and slightly acid smell arises from this lamp during\r\nits ignition. It is perfectly safe, as nothing can fall from it;\r\nand its novel appearance, in a wick's keeping red hot for such a\r\nlength of time, is very surprising to persons unacquainted with its\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nP.S.--When the wire has become oxided, it will be necessary to\r\nuncoil it, and rub it bright again with fine glass-paper; which\r\nwill cause it to act again with increased effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK.\r\n\r\nSuch wire as is here described may, probably, be obtained in\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] In using the word \"pit,\" instead of \"mine,\" I have\r\naccommodated my language to the custom of the country.\r\n\r\n[18] Since the above article was written we have received some as\r\nlarge as a finger.\r\n\r\n[19] The green earth of most mineralogists. EDITOR.\r\n\r\n[20] _Formation_--a geological phrase, of German origin.\r\n\r\n[21] Doubtless the pea ore of the Wernerians. EDITOR.\r\n\r\n[22] This jet of cold water being let into the cylinder itself,\r\nnecessarily cooled it at every stroke; and then it was necessary\r\nto heat it again to the boiling point, before the piston would\r\nreascend, and thus a vast loss of heat occurred. EDITOR.\r\n\r\n[23] But it is not necessary (as in the plate) to crowd the engine\r\ninto the after-part of the boat, the boilers maybe placed forward,\r\nand near them, or over them, _the cylinder_, &c. The power is\r\nthen communicated to the stern-wheel by a long shaft, supported\r\non, or immediately under, the deck. This arrangement gives room\r\nfor loading both behind and before the boilers and engine, and\r\nequalizes the burden. This is the actual arrangement of the\r\nMerrimack boat.\r\n\r\n[24] It is found with very high steam that the source of supply\r\nmust be above the _chamber_, or a small quantity of cold water\r\nintroduced to condense the steam therein.\r\n\r\n[25] Taken from the Philosophical Magazine, and by that work from\r\nthe Annales de Chimie and de Physique, for January, 1818.\r\n\r\n[26] A method of rendering changeable the sound of the same\r\npipes in the organ, which had occurred to the writer, but which\r\nwas not inserted above on account of the supposed difficulty of\r\nmaking the change sufficient in degree, he has since found to\r\nhave been executed by the Rev. H. Liston, who has succeeded, by\r\nmeans of shaders capable of being brought before the mouths of\r\nhis pipes by the action of pedals, in giving them three distinct\r\nsounds each, varying by two commas. (See the description of his\r\nEnharmonic organ, in Rees' Cyc. or Tilloch's Phil. Mag.) His scale\r\nembraces 59 intervals to the octave, and is intended to produce\r\nperfect harmony in all the keys. But as it will require the use of\r\npedals perpetually, even on the same key, and a ready and perfect\r\nknowledge of small musical intervals, which practical musicians\r\ncan seldom possess, there is no probability that it will ever be\r\nextensively adopted. Perhaps, however, four or five sounds, such as\r\nD♯, E♯, A♭, D♭, might be added to the common scale of 12 intervals\r\nby means of his mechanism, with advantage. An instrument thus\r\nfurnished would require the use of pedals but seldom, and would\r\ncontain chromatic degrees sufficient for the accurate performance\r\nof the great mass of organ music.\r\n\r\n[27] These picture, as is well known, represent the assault on\r\nQuebec, and the battle of Bunker's Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GEOLOGY, MINERALOGY, TOPOGRAPHY, &C.\r\n                                                              Page\r\n\r\n  Art.

I. _Hints on some of the Outlines of Geological Arrangement,\r\nwith particular Reference to the System of Werner, in a letter to\r\nthe Editor, from_ WILLIAM MACLURE, _Esq. dated Paris, 22d August,\r\n1818_.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY REMARKS.\r\n\r\nSome years since, during Mr. Maclure's geological survey of the\r\nUnited States, the editor had the pleasure of passing a few days,\r\nin company with that gentleman, in exploring the geology of the\r\nvicinity of New-Haven. Near that town, junctions, on an extensive\r\nscale, between widely different formations, are to be observed. A\r\nradius of ten miles, with New-Haven for a centre, will describe\r\na circle within which the geological student may find (with the\r\nexception of formations, unquestionably volcanic) most of the\r\nimportant rocks of the globe, and a radius of even six or seven\r\nmiles will include the greater number of these. At, and near the\r\nterminations of the primitive ranges, there are rocks which appear\r\nto have, in a high degree, the characters of the transition class.\r\nAmong them is the beautiful green marble of the Milford Hills,\r\nseven miles from New-Haven. Mr. Maclure visited that district, and\r\neven suggested the first hint which afterward led to the discovery\r\nof the marble. Doubts being entertained concerning some of the\r\ngeological relations of those rocks, a letter was addressed to\r\nMr. Maclure (then in Philadelphia) on the subject. His answer is\r\nsubjoined.\r\n\r\nIn giving it to the public, the editor takes a liberty which he\r\nhopes the respectable author will pardon, because his production,\r\nalthough evidently never intended for the public eye, contains\r\nstatements and opinions of no small importance to the young\r\ngeologist, especially of this country.\r\n\r\nGeology, at the present day, means not a merely theoretical and\r\nusually a visionary and baseless speculation, concerning the\r\norigin of the globe; but, on the contrary, the _result of actual\r\nexamination into the nature, structure, and arrangement of the\r\nmaterials of which it is composed_. It is therefore obvious,\r\nthat the opinions of those men, who, with competent talent and\r\nscience, have, with a direct reference to this subject, explored\r\nmany countries, and visited different continents, are entitled to\r\npre-eminent respect. SAUSSURE, by his scientific journeys among the\r\nAlps, (although a limited district) has given deserved celebrity to\r\nhis own name, and, if it were possible, has thrown an additional\r\ncharm of attraction over those romantic and sublime regions.\r\nDolomieu has made us familiar with the productions and phenomena of\r\nvolcanoes, those awful and mysterious laboratories of subterranean\r\nfire. Humboldt has surveyed the sublimest peaks of both continents,\r\nand examined the structure of the globe amidst the valleys of\r\nMexico and the snows of Chimborazo and Pinchinca; and Werner, with\r\nopportunities much more limited, (confined indeed to his native\r\ncountry, Saxony) but with astonishing sagacity and perseverance,\r\ndeduced from what he saw, a classification of the rocks of our\r\nglobe, which, although not perfect, has done immense service to the\r\nscience of Geology. In this distinguished group (to which other\r\nimportant names might be added) Mr. Maclure has unquestionably a\r\nright to be placed. Few men have seen so much of the structure of\r\nour globe, and few have done so much with such small pretensions.\r\nHis work on American Geology is noticed with becoming respect even\r\nin Edinburgh,[28] that focus of geological science. His opinions\r\non some of the more obscure and doubtful parts of the Wernerian\r\ngeology are worthy of peculiar consideration; for they are founded\r\non a course of observations vastly more extensive than Werner ever\r\nhad it in his power to make. The name of Werner will always be\r\nvenerated as long as geological science shall be cultivated, for\r\ngeology owes more to him than to any other man; but his pupils\r\nshould not now demand that implicit and unqualified adoption of ALL\r\nhis opinions, which will allow no other question to be raised, than\r\nwhat Werner taught or believed.\r\n\r\nWith these explanatory remarks, the following extract of Mr.\r\nMaclure's letter is now subjoined:\r\n\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nYour letter of the 26th June came just as I was embarking for\r\nEurope. The information it requires concerning the primitive trap\r\nand flint slate, the transition and secondary rocks, &c. &c. is\r\ndifficult to give without the aid of specimens, and frequently\r\nrequires the examination of the relative position of the strata\r\nbefore any correct idea can be formed. I will, however, endeavour\r\nto give you the little my experience has brought me acquainted with.\r\n\r\nFollowing the nomenclature of Werner, I have given a list of his\r\nrocks; but in describing them there are many of his names which I\r\ndo not use; because I never met with them. Primitive trap is one\r\ninstance--I do not use trap as a substantive, except in describing\r\nthat kind of trap which Werner calls the newest flætz trap, the\r\nnearest to which is your trap,[29] which covers the oldest red\r\nsandstone.\r\n\r\nThe primitive flint slate is in the same predicament. I have always\r\nfound it on the borders of the transition, between it and the\r\nsecondary.\r\n\r\nPrimitive gypsum I have not found.\r\n\r\nWhat Werner calls primitive trap may perhaps be compact\r\nhornblende, or perhaps the newest flætz trap, when it happens to\r\ncover the primitive; for, this species of trap, like the currents\r\nof lava, covers indiscriminately all classes of rocks, and is one\r\nreason why I consider it as the remains of ancient lava.\r\n\r\nTransition trap is a rock that I have not met with, and may\r\nperhaps be a part of the flætz trap that happened to cover the\r\ntransition, without any immediate connexion, but like a current\r\nof lava, overlying all the classes of rocks it meets with. This\r\nmisapplication of names naturally arises from the system of\r\nneptunian origin, on which the nomenclature of Werner is founded.\r\n\r\nGreywake and greywake slate are aggregates of rounded particles\r\nof rocks, evidently the detritus of more ancient formations,\r\nand differ from the aggregates of pudding and sandstone of the\r\nsecondary class, in the following properties, viz.\r\n\r\nThe aggregates of transition are harder and much more compact, than\r\nthe secondary; they are also cemented by argil, taking a slaty form.\r\n\r\nThis cement is in much greater quantity, in proportion to the\r\nparticles cemented, and has the appearance as if the cement at the\r\ntime of formation, had a consistence sufficient to prevent the\r\nparticles from touching each other.\r\n\r\nThey have, in common with all the transition rocks, a regular and\r\nuniform dip from the horizon, from 10 to 40 degrees; and sometimes\r\nmore. This is perhaps the strongest mark of distinction which\r\nseparates them from the secondary, which are horizontal, or follow\r\nthe inequalities of the surface on which they were deposited.\r\n\r\nThe transition are distinguished from the primitive in\r\nbeing aggregates of rounded particles, having little or no\r\ncrystallization, and containing, or alternating with strata, which\r\ncontain organic matter.\r\n\r\nThe oldest red sandstone, with all its accompanying strata, I\r\nshould incline to put into the transition, as having many of\r\nthe properties of that class, and occupying the same relative\r\nsituation in the stratification of the globe. It is at a constant\r\ndip (although small) from the horizon; the cement is in greater\r\nquantities in proportion to the particles cemented than in any of\r\nthe secondary aggregates, &c. &c.\r\n\r\nThe character of the secondary is a horizontal position, that\r\nperhaps does not admit of the same facility of examining the\r\nrelative situation of its stratification. The compact limestone\r\nis, probably, with reason, considered as the lowest of the\r\nsecondary formation, and always under the coal formation, but it\r\nappears to me that the secondary is deposited in basins alongside\r\nof one another, and that each basin has a different order of\r\nsuperposition, according to the nature of the agents employed in\r\nthe deposition; that it is a partial, and by no means a general\r\ndeposition. The secondary aggregates of sandstone and puddings\r\nhave been evidently beds of sand or gravel, and of course, in that\r\nstate would be called alluvial, but when cemented together by the\r\ninfiltration of water, carrying along with it lime, iron, or any\r\nother body capable of agglutinating the particles together, become\r\nrocks, and may alternate in all proportions.\r\n\r\nI am therefore inclined to think, that in geology the best mode for\r\nthe greatest part of the secondary would be to give the relative\r\nposition of the strata of each valley or basin; and I am rather of\r\nopinion that they would all differ from one another.\r\n\r\nThe French and English basin having chalk for the lowest stratum,\r\nwhich has occupied the geologists of both countries for these 10\r\nor 15 years, is perhaps the best known; yet they do not know the\r\nrelative position of the chalk and coals, because coals have not\r\nbeen found in the same basin with chalk: coals occupy basins filled\r\nwith different kinds of rocks, and have no resemblance to the rocks\r\nfound covering the chalk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. II. _On the Geology, Mineralogy, Scenery, and Curiosities\r\nof Parts of Virginia, Tennessee, and the Alabama and Mississippi\r\nTerritories, &c. with Miscellaneous Remarks, in a letter to the\r\nEditor._ By the REV. ELIAS CORNELIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To Benjamin Silliman, Professor, &c._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\nHaving recently returned from a tour of considerable extent in the\r\nUnited States, I avail myself with pleasure of the first leisure\r\nmoment, to communicate, agreeably to your request, some facts,\r\nrelative to the Mineralogy and Geology of that part of the country\r\nthrough which I passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY REMARKS.\r\n\r\nBefore doing this, you will permit me to premise, that in\r\nconsequence of my limited acquaintance with these branches of\r\nNatural Science, and the still more limited time, which other and\r\nimportant concerns allowed me to devote to the subject, I can do\r\nlittle more than give a general description. What my eye could\r\ncatch, as I travelled from one country and wilderness to another,\r\npreserving occasionally a few of the most interesting specimens,\r\nwas all I could do. The specimens you have received. The narrative\r\nI am about to give, is drawn principally from the notes which were\r\ntaken on the journey, and will be confined to a simple _statement\r\nof such facts_ as were either observed by myself, or derived from\r\ngood authority. Their application to preconceived theories, I leave\r\nto those who have more leisure and disposition for speculation than\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\nA description of a few natural and artificial curiosities which\r\ncame under particular notice, will not, I trust, be thought an\r\nimproper digression. The whole is committed to your disposal; and\r\nif it shall add but one mite to the treasury of American Natural\r\nHistory, I shall be gratified, and rejoice to have made even this\r\nsmall remuneration for your unwearied efforts, to impart to one,\r\nformerly your pupil, a love for Natural Science.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Author's Route._\r\n\r\nMy route was in a line nearly direct from Boston to New-Orleans;\r\npassing through the principal cities to Washington; thence,\r\ndiagonally, through Virginia, East Tennessee, and the northwestern\r\nangle of Georgia; in a western course through the north division\r\nof the Territory of Alabama, to the northeastern boundary of the\r\nState of Mississippi; and thence in a line nearly southwest to\r\nNatchez. From this last place I descended the river Mississippi to\r\nNew-Orleans. On my return I frequently varied from this course,\r\nand had increased opportunities for surveying the country. In both\r\ninstances I passed through the countries belonging to the Cherokee,\r\nChickesaw, and Choctaw tribes of Indians, and travelled among them,\r\nin all, about one thousand miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geology of Virginia._\r\n\r\nAs others have described more minutely and accurately than I can,\r\nthe country north of Virginia, I shall begin with a few remarks\r\non the geological character of that State. It is there that the\r\ntraveller, in passing from the Atlantic to the interior, crosses\r\nsuccessively the most important formations of the earth, from the\r\nmost recent alluvial to the oldest primitive. For a considerable\r\ndistance from the coast, the country is alluvial. It then assumes\r\nan older secondary formation[30]--and sandstone and puddingstone\r\nare frequent. This is the character of the District of Columbia,\r\nand indeed of a great part of the valley of the Potomac.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sandstone of the Capitol, &c._\r\n\r\nIn this valley, and adjacent to the river, is found the _sandstone_\r\nof which the President's house, and the Capitol are constructed.\r\nIt is composed of fine silicious grains, is easily wrought, and\r\nfrom its colour, has the appearance at a small distance of white\r\nmarble.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beautiful Breccia._\r\n\r\nIt is also in the valley of this river, and not far from its\r\nfamous passage through the Blue Ridge, that immense quarries of\r\nbeautiful Breccia have been opened. This rock was first brought\r\ninto use by Mr. Latrobe, for some years employed by the government\r\nas principal architect. It is composed of pebbles, and fragments\r\nof silicious and calcareous stones of almost every size, from\r\na grain, to several inches in diameter, strongly and perfectly\r\ncemented. Some are angular, others rounded. Their colours are very\r\nvarious, and often bright. Red, white, brown, gray, and green,\r\nare alternately conspicuous, with every intermediate shade. Owing\r\nto the silicious stones which are frequently imbedded through the\r\nmass, it is wrought with much difficulty; but when finished, shows\r\na fine polish, and is unquestionably one of the most beautifully\r\nvariegated marbles, that ever ornamented any place. It would be\r\ndifficult to conceive of any thing more grand than the hall of\r\nthe Representatives, in the Capitol, supported as it is by twenty\r\nor thirty pillars formed of the solid rock, and placed in an\r\namphitheatrical range; each pillar about three feet in diameter,\r\nand twenty in height. Some idea of the labour which is employed in\r\nworking the marble may be formed from the fact, that the expense of\r\neach pillar is estimated at five thousand dollars. The specimens in\r\nyour possession, are good examples of its general structure, but\r\nconvey no adequate idea of its beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Petrifaction of Wood._\r\n\r\nIt will be proper to notice in this place, a petrifaction of wood\r\nwhich is found on the road from Washington to Fredericksburgh, 16\r\nmiles from the latter, and four miles north of the court-house in\r\nStafford county. It is remarkable for its size, rather than for\r\nany singularity in the composition. It was found by digging away\r\nthe earth on the side of the road, and appears to have been the\r\ntrunk of a considerable tree. It is firmly fixed in the ground,\r\nand penetrates it obliquely; how far has not yet been ascertained.\r\nAt the time I saw it about two feet had been exposed. The diameter\r\nis about eight inches. Its colour is white, sometimes resembling\r\nthat of wood. The fibres are well preserved, and so is the general\r\nstructure. It is much to be desired, that some one would clear\r\nit from its bed, and give it entire to one of our mineralogical\r\ncabinets.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geological Features._\r\n\r\nNext to the alluvial and secondary formations, as you pass to the\r\nwest and northwest, are to be found ranges of granite and shistose,\r\nand other primitive rocks; interspersed with these may be seen\r\nsandstone, clay, slate, quartz, and limestone. Granite ranges\r\nwere particularly seen in the neighbourhood of Fredericksburgh,\r\ncrossing the Rappahannock; and in Orange and Albemarle counties,\r\nextending nearly to the Blue Ridge. Great quantities of quartz and\r\nquartz rock, sometimes covering with their fragments the sides of\r\nhills, are frequent. Another, and more interesting rock in the same\r\nconnexion, is found in Albemarle county. For some time I doubted\r\nto what class to refer it. But from its resemblance to the rocks\r\nof the east and west mountains near New-Haven, I ventured to call\r\nit trap or whinstone. It becomes more abundant as you approach the\r\nBlue Ridge, and the granite disappears. On the sides and summit of\r\nthe mountain, its appearance is more decidedly that of greenstone.\r\nIn crossing the southwest mountain, the range to which Monticello\r\nbelongs, and distant from the Blue Ridge about 25 miles, I observed\r\nthe same rock. Whether this opinion is just, you will be able to\r\ndecide from the specimens which have been forwarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Blue Ridge._\r\n\r\nI have repeatedly named the Blue Ridge. It is the first of those\r\nlong and parallel ranges of mountains, called the Alleghany; and\r\nconstitutes one of the most prominent features in the geology of\r\nthe United States. Its height I cannot determine with accuracy.\r\nProbably it would not average more than one thousand feet. Its base\r\nmay extend in diameter from one to two miles; and yet such is the\r\ninfluence it has on the climate, that vegetation on the eastern,\r\nis usually two weeks earlier than on the western side. And what\r\nis remarkable, this difference obtains, on the former side at\r\nleast, until you arrive within a few hundred yards of the summit.\r\nI crossed the mountain in two places, distant from each other one\r\nhundred miles, but observed nothing essentially different in their\r\nmineralogy. At one of them called the _Rockfish-Gap_, on the road\r\nfrom Charlotteville to Staunton, I spent a few hours, and brought\r\naway specimens of all the varieties of minerals which I could find.\r\nThese have been submitted to your inspection. Among them, you will,\r\nI think, see greenstone, epidote, and slate more or less allied\r\nto the first. These are the most common rocks, and excepting the\r\nsecond, are usually stratified. The epidote is generally associated\r\nwith quartz, and sometimes is imbedded in it. In some instances\r\nit has a porphyritic appearance, and is very beautiful. In\r\nothers, it is coated with small filaments of a greenish asbestos.\r\nOther minerals were found, whose nature I could not so easily\r\ndetermine. I regret exceedingly, that I cannot furnish you with a\r\nmore complete description of this interesting mountain. That its\r\ncharacter is peculiar, or different from the country on either\r\nside of it, must be obvious to the most superficial observer.\r\nIts principal rock does indeed bear a resemblance to the trap or\r\nwhinstone of Albemarle county, and yet I think you will say it\r\nis not the same. One fact of importance cannot be mistaken; this\r\nmountain constitutes the great dividing line between the granite\r\nand limestone countries. For you no sooner reach its western base,\r\nthan the greenstone and epidote disappear; and _limestone_ pervades\r\nthe country for hundreds of miles in every direction. In all the\r\ndistance from this mountain to New-Orleans, I did not find a single\r\nspecimen of granite, or greenstone. This may appear singular, since\r\nMr. Maclure and Professor Cleaveland have a granite range on their\r\nmaps, immediately west of the Blue Ridge; and even that mountain\r\nis on those maps, in some parts of it, covered with the granitic\r\ntinge. This may be true. I can answer for only two points of it,\r\nand for that part of the country beyond, lying near the main road\r\nto Tennessee. In this route I descended almost the whole length\r\nof the great valley included between the Blue Ridge on the east,\r\nand the north mountain on the west. But in no instance did I meet\r\nwith specimens of granite; nor west of the Blue Ridge with any\r\nprevailing rock but limestone. I know of no reason why the Blue\r\nRidge should not be regarded as the first great dividing line\r\nbetween the granite and limestone countries. The change in the\r\ngeological formation is so sudden and striking, that it would be\r\ndifficult for the most careless traveller with his eyes open, not\r\nto observe it. The face of nature, he cannot but perceive, wears a\r\ndifferent aspect; the air is more cool and lively; even the water\r\nwhich he drinks possesses new properties perceptible to his taste.\r\nThe inhabitants no longer speak of their \"sandstone water;\" but\r\nevery where he hears of \"limestone water.\" Indeed for 800 miles in\r\nthe direction which I travelled, he tastes no other water. Every\r\nspring and every rivulet, is strongly impregnated with carbonate of\r\nlime. The vessels in which it is prepared for culinary use, soon\r\nbecome lined with a white calcareous crust. Nor is its taste the\r\nonly inconvenience experienced by the traveller unaccustomed to it.\r\nIt often injures the health of a stranger, and covers the surface\r\nof the body with cutaneous eruptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limestone country in inclined Strata._\r\n\r\nThe geological observer has now entered upon a very interesting\r\nfield. Its great extent, and its wonderful uniformity, give new\r\nfacilities to investigation. Two divisions of it seem to have been\r\nmade in nature.\r\n\r\nThe _first_ is that which includes the limestone lying in INCLINED\r\nSTRATA. This division extends from the Blue Ridge, to the\r\nCumberland mountain in East Tennessee, a distance in the direction\r\nof my route of 500 miles. Of course it includes all the ranges,\r\nfive in number, of the Alleghany mountains. The strata lie in a\r\ncourse northeast and southwest, the same as the general course of\r\nthe mountains. The angle which they make with the horizon is very\r\nvariable, from 25° to 45°. The colour of the rock varies from blue,\r\nand pale blue, to gray, or grayish white, frequently it presents a\r\ndull earthy appearance. The fracture is more or less conchoidal.\r\nSometimes the rock assumes a different character, and the fracture\r\nis _uneven_, and the texture firm. This last is distinguished from\r\nthe former, not only by the fracture, but by the colour. It is\r\nusually spoken of by the inhabitants as the _gray limestone_, the\r\ncolour of the other being usually of a bluish cast. It differs\r\nfrom that also by being less brittle, and possessing the quality\r\ndenominated by stonecutters, \"_tough_.\" In consequence of this, and\r\nits enduring heat better, it is more frequently used in building\r\nthan the other. This variety of limestone is not uncommon. Its\r\ncolour is not always _gray_, sometimes it is a reddish brown,\r\nand sometimes white. Immense quantities of it, possessing either\r\na grayish or reddish brown colour, are found in the vicinity of\r\nKnoxville, East Tennessee. One range of it is crossed by every\r\nroad, passing to the south and east of Knoxville. Its appearance is\r\nthat of some variegated marbles; white veins penetrate it, and wind\r\nthrough it in every direction. Whether any part of it has a texture\r\nsufficiently fine and firm to be wrought to advantage, is yet to be\r\ndetermined. To the eye of a superficial observer, there are many\r\nindications that it has. A specimen of very fine white marble,\r\nresembling the Italian white, was shown me in Augusta county,\r\nVirginia, which was found 15 miles from Staunton, where there is\r\nsaid to be a considerable quantity of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limestone country in Horizontal Strata._\r\n\r\nThe _second_ great division of the limestone country extends, on\r\nthe route which I took, two hundred miles from the Cumberland\r\nmountain, and others associated with it southwest, as far as\r\nthe Dividing Ridge, which separates the waters flowing into the\r\nTennessee from those which proceed direct to the gulf of Mexico.\r\nThe grand circumstance which distinguishes the limestone of\r\nthis division from that already described, is this, ITS STRATA\r\nARE HORIZONTAL. Frequently immense piles may be seen forming\r\nbold precipices, but _always_ in horizontal layers, differing in\r\nthickness, from a few inches to many feet. How far this arrangement\r\nextends to the west and north, I have not yet been able to learn.\r\nTravellers always speak of the limestone rocks in West Tennessee\r\nand Kentucky as _flat_, from which circumstance I conclude that the\r\nCumberland mountain forms for a considerable distance at least,\r\nthe eastern boundary. I have observed but three other particulars\r\nin which the strata of the _horizontal_ differ from those of the\r\n_inclined_ limestone.\r\n\r\n1. Its colour is not so strongly marked with the bluish tinge.\r\n\r\n2. It is not so commonly penetrated with white veins of a\r\nsemicrystallized carbonate of lime; nor is it so frequently\r\nassociated with the _uneven_ fractured species.\r\n\r\n3. Petrifactions are oftener found in it.\r\n\r\nI will here take the liberty to suggest, whether in our maps of\r\ngeology, some notice should not be taken of this very important\r\ndivision in the limestone country. Such a division exists _in\r\nfact_; nature has made it; and if geology depends on nature for its\r\nonly legitimate inductions, there can be no reason why a feature\r\nso prominent as this, should be overlooked. I shall not undertake\r\nto account for their difference: but would not every geological\r\ntheorist consider them as distinct formations?[31]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cumberland Mountain._\r\n\r\nThe Cumberland mountain, which forms a part of this dividing line,\r\nis itself a singular formation. It belongs to the class called\r\n\"Table mountains.\" Its width varies from a few miles, to more\r\nthan fifty. Its height is not perceptibly different from that of\r\nthe Blue Ridge. It forms a circuit, in a shape somewhat resembling\r\na half moon. Winding to the southwest, it keeps a course north\r\nof the Tennessee river, in some places nearly parallel with it;\r\npasses a few miles to the southeast of Huntsville in the Alabama\r\nTerritory, and not long after terminates. At one part, over which\r\nI crossed, the mountain is eighteen miles wide. This is about 150\r\nmiles southwest of Knoxville, a little north of the 35th degree of\r\nN. Lat. I had not ascended the mountain more than halfway, before\r\nI found sandstone begin to intermingle with limestone strata. As\r\nI drew near the summit, the limestone disappeared entirely, and\r\nsandstone prevailed in abundance, with no other mineral associated\r\nuntil I reached the western descent, where I met bold precipices\r\nof horizontal limestone, reaching from the base to the summit. I\r\nexamined several sandstone rocks while crossing the mountain, found\r\nthem usually imbedded in the earth, generally with flat surfaces,\r\nof a fine grain, and strong texture. The colour is usually a\r\nreddish brown, or grayish red. The specimen which you have received\r\nis a good example. I crossed this mountain in the vicinity of\r\nHuntsville, not less than one hundred miles southwest of the place\r\nabove-mentioned, and found it not wider than mountains commonly\r\nare. Its height had also become less, and horizontal limestone in\r\nregular strata prevailed in every part.\r\n\r\nAlthough this mountain forms a part of the dividing line which\r\nhas been mentioned, it does not exclusively so: for the Rackoon\r\nmountain, which crosses the Tennessee river, at the place so well\r\nknown by the name of \"the Suck,\" and the Look-Out mountain, which\r\nterminates abruptly about 6 miles to the left of \"the Suck,\" form\r\nan acute angle with the Cumberland, and are composed of horizontal\r\nstrata of limestone. Thus it would appear the line which divides\r\nthe two kingdoms of this rock, is nearly north and south, inclining\r\nperhaps a few points to the east and west.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scenery_.\r\n\r\nAnd here I cannot forbear pausing a moment to call your attention\r\nto the grand and picturesque scenery which opens to the view of\r\nthe admiring spectator. The country is still possessed by the\r\naborigines, and the hand of civilization has done but little to\r\nsoften the wild aspect of nature. The Tennessee River, having\r\nconcentrated into one mass, the numerous streams it has received\r\nin its course of three or four hundred miles, glides through an\r\nextended valley with a rapid and overwhelming current, half a\r\nmile in width. At this place, a group of mountains stand ready to\r\ndispute its progress. First, the \"Look-Out,\" an independent range,\r\ncommencing thirty miles below, presents, opposite the River's\r\ncourse, its bold and rocky termination of two thousand feet. Around\r\nits brow is a pallisade of naked rocks, from seventy to one hundred\r\nfeet. The River flows upon its base, and instantly twines to the\r\nright. Passing on for six miles further it turns again, and is met\r\nby the side of the Rackoon mountain. Collecting its strength into\r\na channel of seventy yards, it severs the mountain, and rushes\r\ntumultuously through the rocky defile, wafting the trembling\r\nnavigator at the rate of a mile in two or three minutes. This\r\npassage is called \"The Suck.\" The summit of the Look-Out mountain\r\noverlooks the whole country. And to those who can be delighted with\r\nthe view of an interminable forest, penetrated by the windings of\r\na bold river, interspersed with hundreds of verdant prairies, and\r\nbroken by many ridges and mountains, furnishes in the month of\r\nMay, a landscape, which yields to few others in extent, variety or\r\nbeauty. Even the aborigines have not been insensible to its charms;\r\nfor in the name which they have given to the Look-Out mountain we\r\nhave a laconic, but very striking description of the scenery. This\r\nname in the Cherokee language, without the aspirated sounds, is\r\n\"O-tullēē-ton-tannâ-tâ-kunnâ-ēē;\" literally, \"mountains looking at\r\neach other.\"\r\n\r\nI have already remarked that the limestone of this mountain lies\r\nin horizontal strata: one mile east from its base it is inclined.\r\nLike the Cumberland, it contains immense rocks of sandstone, but\r\nof a coarser grain, verging occasionally into pudding stone.\r\nI was told by a white man, a professed millwright, that among\r\nthese sandstone rocks, he knew of many which were suitable for\r\nmillstones. At the missionary establishment, called \"Brainerd,\"\r\neight miles east of the mountain, I saw one of them which was used\r\nfor this purpose to much advantage. It is composed of fine and\r\nlarge grains of silicious stones, nearly white, and resembling\r\npebbles of white quartz: the texture is firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Silicious Minerals, &c._\r\n\r\nI will now notice an important fact, applicable to the whole extent\r\nof limestone country, which has come under my observation. It is\r\nits association with a description of minerals, all of which appear\r\nto be _silicious_. To describe them minutely, would require several\r\npages. From the time I entered the limestone country till I left it\r\nthis association was observed. The minerals included in it differ\r\nmuch in their external character. Their size varies from that of\r\nrocks to the smallest fragments. Usually they lie loose upon the\r\nearth, in angular forms, having the appearance of a stone that has\r\nbeen broken in pieces by the hammer. Sometimes they cover the sides\r\nof hills and mountains in such abundance as to prevent or impede\r\nvegetation. When the disintegration is minute, they are serviceable\r\nrather than otherwise; and the farmer talks of his \"good black,\"\r\nor \"white gravel land.\" It renders this service, I presume, not\r\nby decomposition, but by preventing the soil and its manure from\r\nbeing washed away. Indeed the different varieties of it are\r\ngenerally scattered over the surface, in pieces so small, that for\r\nconvenience sake, the whole may be denominated a _silicious gravel_.\r\n\r\nSometimes the mineral is imbedded in limestone, in the form of\r\nnodules, thus indicating their original connexion with it.\r\n\r\nThe varieties, so far as I have observed, are quartz, hornstone,\r\nflint, jasper, and semi-opal; and several, which to me are\r\nnon-descripts. _Quartz_ is the most abundant. It is found of\r\ndifferent colours; compact, and porous or cellular; of every size;\r\nsimple and associated with other silicious stones; massive and\r\ncrystallized. In Augusta and Rockbridge counties in Virginia,\r\nbeautiful crystals of quartz, of a singular form, are found. They\r\nare six-sided prisms, with double acuminations, that is, with\r\nsix-sided pyramids, mounted on the opposite ends of the prism. A\r\nspecimen of two such crystals united, you have received. It was\r\nfound near Lexington. A curious variety of the quartz gravel-stone\r\noccurs on both sides of Elk River, a few miles above its junction\r\nwith the Tennessee, in the Alabama territory. As you travel to the\r\nwest from Huntsville, it appears first in the neighbourhood of\r\nFort Hampton, two miles east of Elk River, and may be seen for ten\r\nmiles west of that river. The mineral is remarkable for containing\r\na curious petrifaction. Its first appearance is that of a solid\r\nscrew. On examination, however, you find it is not spiral; but\r\nconsists of parallel concentric layers. Their diameter varies in\r\ndifferent specimens, from that of a pin to half an inch. They stand\r\nin the centre of a hollow cylinder, extending its whole length, and\r\noccupying about one-third of its dimensions. The stone is sometimes\r\nperfectly filled with these forms. The petrifaction I could not\r\nhave named, had you not pronounced it the \"Entrochite.\"\r\n\r\n_Hornstone_, next to quartz, is the most abundant of the silicious\r\nminerals associated with limestone. It is very often seen imbedded\r\nin rounded masses, both in the inclined and horizontal strata.\r\n\r\n_Flint_ is more rare. Several fine specimens were observed on the\r\nwestern declivity of the Look-Out Mountain, but in no instances in\r\nlarge masses or quantities.\r\n\r\n_Semi-Opal_ was found in one instance on the dividing ridge, which\r\nconstitutes the southwestern boundary of the limestone strata.\r\n\r\nOf the non-descripts you have several specimens. One variety\r\nstrikes fire with steel, is a milk-white colour, adheres slightly\r\nto the tongue, and has no degree of translucency on its edges. As\r\nMr. Kain has furnished you with an interesting detail of particular\r\nminerals found in East Tennessee and Western Virginia, I need not\r\nrecapitulate what he has so well said.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. III. _Notice of the Scenery, Geology, Mineralogy, Botany, &c.\r\nof Belmont County, Ohio, by_ CALEB ATWATER, _Esq. of Circleville_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBelmont county is bounded on the north by Jefferson and Harrison,\r\non the west by Guernsey, and south by Monroe county, and on the\r\neast by the Ohio river. It is 27 miles in length, and 21 in\r\nbreadth, containing 535 square miles. Its name, _Belmont_, or\r\nbeautiful mountain, indicates its situation, for it contains within\r\nits boundaries a fine body of land, rising gradually as you are\r\ntravelling from the Ohio to the west, until you arrive at about the\r\nmiddle of it, where, from the elevation on which you stand, the eye\r\nin an eastern direction, beholds one of the most charming prospects\r\nin the state. Looking towards the east, in a pleasant morning, you\r\nbehold a beautiful country of hill and dale spread out before you,\r\ndivided into convenient and well-cultivated farms, intersected by\r\nglittering streams, meandering through them towards the Ohio. You\r\nhear the lowing of numerous herds around you, the shrill matin of\r\nthe songsters of the forest, and the busy hum of the industrious\r\nhusbandman; you see here and there a clump of trees interspersed\r\namong the cultivated parts of the country; you see the comfortable\r\ndwelling-house, the substantial barn, and hear the rumbling noise\r\nof the mill; and when you reflect that those who dwell here are\r\nindustrious and enterprising, virtuous, free, and happy, you behold\r\nwith pleasure, and listen with delight, while reflecting on the\r\nobjects around you.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geology and Mineralogy._\r\n\r\nOn the surface is seen a rich vegetable mould, made by the decay\r\nand putrefaction of vegetable substances. Along the Ohio, a wide\r\nintervale of the richest alluvion is found, which produces as\r\nluxuriant a growth of vegetation as any in the world. On the banks\r\nof the creeks which pass through this country the alluvial soil is\r\nnot so wide as that on the river, but equally rich and productive.\r\nOn the hills (and there are many of them) there are two kinds of\r\nsoil, the silicious and the argillaceous, the first is formed from\r\nthe decomposition of the rocks which once covered the surface, the\r\nlatter from the slate which lay under them. Where these rocks are\r\ndecomposed, and the country is hilly, it will readily be believed\r\nthat the two kinds of soil are frequently blended together. In some\r\nplaces we see the best of clay for bricks; whilst in other places,\r\nand those in the vicinity of the former, we find the best of sand\r\nto mould them in when manufactured. Hard limestone of the very best\r\nquality is found in detached fragments in the sides of hills, and\r\nin strata, in abundance, along the beds of streams.\r\n\r\nThe ruins of the sandstone formation are here seen scattered about\r\nin fragments, or decomposed and intimately blended with those of\r\nother formations.\r\n\r\nFossil coal is every where found under the hills, of the very best\r\nquality, and in sufficient quantity not only for the fuel of the\r\npresent, but many future generations, and is so easily obtained\r\nthat the expense of fuel is a mere trifle. The oxide of iron, or\r\niron ore variously combined, is recognized in many places, and\r\nwater combined with muriate of soda, or common salt, is as common.\r\nSalines or licks are found in many places, where animals also, both\r\nwild and domesticated, resort in great numbers to drink the waters.\r\nThese are frequently near some little water-course. Several sulphur\r\nand chalybeate springs are known to exist in this county, and some\r\nwhich throw out considerable quantities of petroleum.\r\n\r\nIn a country where iron and fossil coal exist, it is no wonder\r\nthat copperas should be found. There are places where copperas\r\nexudes in a state sufficiently pure in quality, and in quantities\r\nsufficient for several families, who collect and use it in dying.\r\nThe same may be said of alum, which is collected in the same way\r\nfor similar purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Botany._\r\n\r\nThough this county is very rich in the mineral, yet it is not less\r\nso in the vegetable kingdom, as may be seen by a reference to the\r\nsubjoined catalogue, although numbers of trees, shrubs, and plants,\r\nare purposely omitted, which are known to exist here.\r\n\r\n   _Family._     _Species._         _Classical name._     _Remarks._\r\n\r\n  Oak,          White,              Quercus Alba,         Abundant.\r\n  ----          Black,              ----    Nigra,            Do.\r\n  ----          Meadow,             ----    Aquatica,     Along the\r\n                                                            streams.\r\n  ----          Chesnut,            ----    Prunus,       Scarce.\r\n  Maple,        Sugar,              Acer Saccharinum,     Abundant.\r\n  ----          White,              ---- Alba.\r\n  Poplar or     White,              Liriodendron,         Abundant.\r\n    Tulip,\r\n  ----          Yellow.\r\n  Walnut,       Black,              Juglans Nigra.\r\n  ----          White,              ----    Alba.\r\n  ----          Shellbark Hickory,  ----    Albaovata.\r\n  ----          Pignut,             ----    Minima.\r\n  ----          Bitternut, and\r\n                  probably several\r\n                  other species.\r\n  Beach,        Two species,        Fagus.\r\n  ----          Chesnut,            ---- Americana.\r\n  Ash,          White,              Fraxinus Alba.\r\n  ----          Blue,               ---- Purpurea.\r\n  ----          Black,              ---- Nigra.\r\n  ----          Swamp,              ---- Aquatica.\r\n  Elm,          Two or three        Ulmus.\r\n                  species,\r\n  Buckeye,      Common,             Æsculusflava Lutea?\r\n  ----          Sweet,              ---- Maxima?\r\n  Locust,       Four species,       Robinia Pseud\r\n                                      Acacia, &c.\r\n  Persimmon,                        Diospyros Virginica.\r\n  Linn or Bass                      Tilia Europea.\r\n    Wood,\r\n\r\n  Cucumber,                         Cucuminis\r\n                                      Sylvestris.\r\n  Dog Wood, or  Two species.\r\n    American\r\n    Box,\r\n  Sycamore,     Two species,        Platanus\r\n                                      Occidentalis, &c.\r\n  Plum,         Several species.\r\n  Thorn,          do.     do.\r\n\r\nThe red bud; the pawpaw; grape-vines of several species, and\r\ngrowing to a great size; sassafras; the black willow, confined\r\nto the streams; the box elder, the common elder, of two species;\r\nthe sumach, of two species; several species of gooseberries;\r\nand a great many others too numerous to be mentioned here.\r\nAmong the herbaceous plants we must not omit the ginseng, the\r\nVirginia snakeroot, the columbo, and the puccoon, two or three\r\nthousand pounds of the roots of which are annually carried by\r\nthe inhabitants to our Atlantic cities. Among the trees, those\r\nbelonging to the oak family are the most numerous, if not the most\r\nvaluable. Split into rails, the farmer builds fences with them, and\r\nsawed into plank, boards, and scantling, they furnish materials\r\nfor houses and barns. The sugar maple is sufficiently abundant, so\r\nthat brown sugar enough is manufactured for domestic purposes. The\r\nsycamore is the largest tree along the river, and the poplar is the\r\nlargest on the hills. The latter grows by the side of the maple and\r\nthe beach, and is a most valuable wood for the house-builder and\r\nthe cabinetmaker. This tree is frequently four and five feet in\r\ndiameter, and continues of nearly the same size as it ascends, 40,\r\n50, and sometimes even 60 feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Streams._\r\n\r\nThe Ohio is the eastern boundary of this county, forming wide\r\nintervales along its banks. Indian Wheeling is a fine mill stream\r\nrising in Harrison county, and after crossing this, empties into\r\nthe Ohio, opposite the town of Wheeling, which stands on the\r\nVirginia side.\r\n\r\nCaptina is another excellent mill stream, which after running about\r\n17 or 18 miles in this county, puts into the Ohio 23 miles by water\r\nbelow Wheeling. These streams visit and fertilize a considerable\r\npart of Belmont.\r\n\r\nFrom the view we have taken of this county, its geology,\r\nmineralogy, and botany, the reader will probably be prepared\r\nwith us to conclude, that no part of the union, of equal extent,\r\ncontains within it greater natural resources, or can support a more\r\ndense population.\r\n\r\nThe seat of justice is St. Clairsville, situated ten miles from\r\nthe Ohio river, at Wheeling. It contains three houses for public\r\nworship, 15 stores, a printing-office, a bank, and 700 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nMany of the inhabitants of this county are Quakers or Friends, who\r\nare charitable, humane, frugal, enterprising, industrious, and\r\nstrongly opposed to slavery. From such a population, possessing\r\nsuch advantages, what may we not hope and expect from their\r\nexertions? Their fertile valleys will be turned into meadows, and\r\ntheir hills into pastures; the ox will fatten in the former, whilst\r\nthe flocks of Andalusia will whiten the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. IV. _Remarks on the Structure of the Calton Hill, near\r\nEdinburgh, Scotland; and on the Aqueous origin of Wacke; by_ J. W.\r\nWEBSTER, M.D. of Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe country around Edinburgh is extremely interesting to the\r\ngeologist, and presents numerous instances of the junction of rocks\r\nto which the advocates of the Neptunian system have referred in\r\nsupport of their opinion as to the aqueous origin of greenstone,\r\nbasalt, and wacke; while the same examples have been cited by the\r\nVolcanists, and by those who hold an intermediate opinion. The\r\nstructure of a portion of Calton hill, where the most distinct\r\nalternations of substances (whose aqueous origin none can dispute,)\r\nwith pure and well characterized wacke are displayed, has not, as\r\nyet, I believe been particularly described.\r\n\r\nEdinburgh is situated nearly in the centre of an extensive coal\r\nformation, where the usual sandstones and other coal measures\r\nare connected with the newer rocks of transition. From the coal\r\nfield rise in many places beds of greenstone, in general forming\r\nsmall conical and round-backed hills. Other eminences are composed\r\nof amygdaloid, claystone, and other porphyries; and basalt and\r\ntrap tuff occur in an overlying position. Of these, it is not my\r\nintention to speak otherwise than as conveying a general idea of\r\nthe geological relation of the wacke above referred to.\r\n\r\nThe structure of Calton hill has been exposed by the recent\r\nimprovements, and in particular by a section made in the\r\nconstruction of the new road to London. The rock occurring in\r\ngreatest abundance, and which is probably the fundamental bed,\r\nis a porphyry, the basis of which in general is claystone, which\r\nin many places passes into felspar, in others becomes a distinct\r\ngreenstone. Numerous veins of calcareous spar traverse it in\r\ndifferent directions, and I am lately informed, that very beautiful\r\nexamples of veins of greenstone of contemporaneous formation with\r\nthe rock itself, have been discovered _in_ the greenstone. Upon the\r\nporphyry rests a bed of trap tuff, upon this other beds of the two\r\nrocks repose, that at the summit being porphyry. The back of the\r\nhill (as we pass from the city) is a spot of peculiar interest,\r\nconsisting of alternate thin beds of bituminous shale, sandstone,\r\nwacke, and clay ironstone, disposed in a manner which will be best\r\nunderstood by a rough outline taken on the spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nMonument to NELSON.\r\n\r\n  A Porphyry.\r\n  B Trap tuff.\r\n  C Porphyry.\r\n  D Trap tuff.\r\n  E Porphyry.\r\n  F Beds of wacke, &c. upper part concealed by vegetation.\r\n\r\n  1 Bituminous shale.\r\n  2 Wacke.\r\n  3 Sandstone.\r\n  4 Bituminous shale, with clay ironstone.\r\n  5 Wacke.\r\n  6 Bituminous shale.\r\n  7 Wacke, _with calc. spar._\r\n  8 Bituminous shale.\r\n  9 Wacke.\r\n  10 Bituminous shale passing on both sides into\r\n  11 Wacke--and _calc. spar._\r\n  12 Bituminous shale.\r\n  13 Wacke.\r\n  14 Bituminous shale.\r\n  15 Wacke.\r\n  16 Bituminous shale.\r\n  17 Sandstone.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe wacke has a greenish gray colour, which is pretty uniform. The\r\nfracture is nearly even and earthy, it is soft, yielding readily to\r\nthe nail, and has a feebly shining streak. A slight stroke with the\r\nhammer causes the mass to separate in fragments of various size,\r\nthe surfaces of which are often smooth and shining, each bed being\r\ncomposed of large distinct concretions, having a tendency to the\r\nprismatic form. This wacke fuses with difficulty before Brooke's\r\nblow-pipe. Specific gravity not determined, as it falls to pieces\r\non being moistened.\r\n\r\nThe sandstone is for the most part gray, in some parts spotted red\r\nand brown, forming, as the section represents, the last stratum\r\nseen; the beds of sandstone are but a few inches in thickness, and\r\nthe last (17) becomes less than an inch; it is probable, however,\r\nfrom the relative situation, from the dip and direction, that these\r\nstrata are a continuation of others seen on the other side of the\r\nhill, where they are of sufficient thickness to have been quarried\r\nfor the purposes of architecture. The _beds_ of all rocks we know\r\nvary greatly in different parts, and it is not unusual for them\r\nto be some feet at one extremity, gradually decreasing till less\r\nthan an inch in thickness at the other, or they may even be lost\r\nentirely, and gradually regain their former size; and it is not\r\nimprobable that these beds of sandstone will be found to continue\r\non towards the adjoining hills of Salisbury Craig and Arthur's\r\nSeat, passing under the greenstone and trap tuff.\r\n\r\nThe bituminous shale presents the usual characters; intermixed\r\nwith it are numerous nodules of the common clay ironstone, the\r\ncolour of which is a yellowish brown, these also frequently present\r\ncharacters common to the three substances, and throughout the beds,\r\nthe passage from the one to the other is distinct. Whatever may be\r\nthe opinions in regard to the origin of bituminous shale, there\r\ncan be but one in regard to that of sandstone; and this has lately\r\nreceived no feeble support from the account given us by Dr. Paris,\r\nof a formation of this rock on the coast of Cornwall, where, says\r\nhe, \"we actually detect nature at work, and she does not refuse\r\nadmittance into her manufactory, nor conceal, with her accustomed\r\nreserve, the details of the operations in which she is engaged.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the appearances which have been thus briefly noticed, no\r\nimpartial geologist, we should imagine, would infer the _volcanic_\r\norigin of any portion of this formation; and if the aqueous origin\r\nof sandstone can be established, that of the wacke must be the same.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom its intimate connexion with the preceding subject, Dr. Webster\r\nsubjoins the following:\r\n\r\n  _Extract from a Paper on a recent formation of Sandstone,\r\n  occurring in various parts of the Northern coast of Cornwall_;\r\n  by JOHN AYSTON PARIS, M.D. F.L.S., &c. &c. Published in the\r\n  Transactions of the Geological Society of Cornwall, 1818.\r\n\r\n\"A very considerable portion of the northern coast of Cornwall,\r\nis covered with a calcareous sand, consisting of minute particles\r\nof comminuted shells. That part which lies between St. Ives and\r\nPadstow is more immediately the subject of the present inquiry;\r\na tract which, with a few exceptions, is entirely covered with\r\nthis species of sand; and which in some places, has accumulated\r\nin quantities so great as to have formed hills of from forty to\r\nsixty feet in elevation. A considerable area, for instance, in\r\nthe parishes of Gwythian and Phillack has been thus desolated,\r\nand several churches have been inundated. In digging into these\r\nsand hills, or upon the occasional removal of some part of them\r\nby the winds, the remains of houses may be seen; and in some\r\nplaces, where the churchyards have been overwhelmed, a great number\r\nof human bones may be found. The sand is supposed to have been\r\noriginally brought from the sea by hurricanes, probably at a remote\r\nperiod.\"----\"The sand first appears in a slight but increasing\r\nstate of aggregation on several parts of the shore in the bay of\r\nSt. Ives; but on approaching the Gwythian river, it becomes more\r\nextensive and indurated. On the shore opposite to Godrevy Island,\r\nan immense mass of it occurs, of more than a hundred feet in\r\nlength, and from twelve to twenty feet in depth, containing entire\r\nshells and fragments of clay slate; it is singular that the whole\r\nmass assumes a striking appearance of stratification. In some\r\nplaces it appears that attempts have been made to separate it,\r\nprobably for the purpose of building; for several old houses in\r\nGwythian are built of it.\"----\"It is around the promontory of New\r\nKaye that the most extensive formation of sandstone takes place.\r\nHere it may be seen in different stages of induration; from a\r\nstate in which it is too friable to be detached from the rock upon\r\nwhich it reposes, to a hardness so considerable, that it requires\r\na very violent blow from a sledge to break it.\"----\"But it is on\r\nthe western side of the promontory of New Kaye, in Fistril Bay,\r\nthat the geologist will be most struck with the formation; for here\r\nno other rock is in sight. The cliffs, which are high, and extend\r\nfor several miles, are entirely composed of it.\"----\"The beach is\r\ncovered with disjointed fragments, which have been detached from\r\nthe cliff above, many of which weigh two or three tons.\"\r\n\r\nThere are three modes by which Dr. Paris conceives the\r\nlapidification of calcareous sand may be effected. 1st. \"By the\r\npercolation of water through a hill of calcareous sand, by which it\r\nbecomes impregnated with carbonate of lime.\" 2d. \"The percolation\r\nof water through strata containing pyritical substances, by which\r\nit becomes impregnated with sulphuric salts.\" 3d. \"The percolation\r\nof water through decomposing slate, or any ferruginous strata, by\r\nwhich it becomes impregnated with iron alumina, and other mineral\r\nmatter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. V. _Localities of Minerals._\r\n\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the American Journal of Science, &c._\r\n\r\n  NEW-YORK, Dec. 21, 1818.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that some mode should be adopted by which the\r\npublic may become acquainted with all the _New American Localities\r\nof Minerals_, as they are discovered from time to time. With\r\ndeference I would suggest, that in each number of your Scientific\r\nJournal, new localities might be recorded in alphabetical order,\r\nfor present information and future reference.\r\n\r\nThe following localities, which have come under my observation, and\r\nwhich are probably not noticed in any work, are at your service.\r\n\r\n  1. _Agate._ Rolled mass: occurred near Powles Hook, New-Jersey.\r\n\r\n  2. _Apatite._ Truncated crystals of one inch, and amorphous;\r\n  occurs in granite, chiefly in the felspar. Corlaer's Hook,\r\n  vicinity of New-York.\r\n\r\n  3. _Brown Mammillary Hematite_, covering quartz crystals.\r\n  Perkiomen lead-mine. Montgomery county, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  4. _Carbonate of Magnesia._ Structure earthy. Apparently a _pure_\r\n  carbonate of magnesia. In mica slate, and granite; chiefly in the\r\n  quartz. Roxborough, Philadelphia county.\r\n\r\n  5. _Common Jasper._ Traversed by veins of semi-opal. Small\r\n  detached masses, frequently waterworn. Rhinebeck, Dutchess\r\n  county, New-York.\r\n\r\n  6. _Compact Malachite._ Perkiomen lead-mine.\r\n\r\n  7. _Fetid Carbonate of Lime._ In ridges; and strata nearly\r\n  vertical, sometimes containing petrifactions. Very frequent in\r\n  Dutchess county, particularly in the neighbourhood of Rhinebeck\r\n  Flats, and near Hyde Park.\r\n\r\n  8. _Fibrous Talc._ In granite. Roxborough.\r\n\r\n  9. _Graphic Granite._ North River, near the city of New-York.\r\n\r\n  10. _Graphite._ In a calcareo-siliceous gangue. Corlear's Hook.\r\n\r\n  11. _Native pulverulent_ (or rather granular) _Sulphur_. In\r\n  pyritical quartz. Barren Hill, Montgomery county, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n  12. _Plumose Asbestus._ Corlaer's Hook.\r\n\r\n  13. _Semi-opal._ In common Jasper--(which see.)\r\n\r\n  14. _Scaly Talc._ In granite. Roxborough.\r\n\r\n  15. _Stellated Quartz._ Perkiomen lead-mine.\r\n\r\n  16. _Sulphate of Barytes._ In sulphuret of lead and silver.\r\n  Livingston's lead-mine, Columbia county, New-York.\r\n\r\n  17. _Sulphuret of Silver._ With sulphuret of lead. Same locality.\r\n\r\n  18. _Tourmalin._ In masses of crystalline quartz. Rhinebeck.\r\n\r\n  Very respectfully,\r\n\r\n  F. C. SCHAEFFER.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following notices were prepared before the receipt of the above\r\nletter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Other Localities of Minerals and of_ ANIMAL REMAINS, _and\r\nacknowledgments of Specimens received_.\r\n\r\n_Guadeloupe._--Native sulphur, obsidian, pitchstone, native alum,\r\nbasaltic hornblende, alum covered with sulphur.\r\n\r\n_Porto Rico._--Hexagonal crystals of mica.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of the above minerals are in the cabinet of Mr. John P.\r\nBrace, at Litchfield, Connecticut.\r\n\r\n_Molybdena_ is found in Shutesbury, Massachusetts, near\r\nNorthampton, east of Connecticut River, on the land of William\r\nEaton. It is the common sulphuret, but remarkably beautiful and\r\nwell characterized. Its colour is nearly that of bright lead, very\r\nbrilliant, smooth, and almost unctuous; soft, flexible, distinctly\r\nfoliated, and the folia are very thin, and easily separable, almost\r\nlike mica. It gives the usual greenish trace on white pottery,\r\nwhile a line drawn parallel on the same basis, by a piece of\r\nplumbago or black-lead, is black; this being (as pointed out by\r\nBrongniart) the easiest criterion, by which to distinguish between\r\nmolybdena and plumbago, or black-lead. We have many times applied\r\nit with entire success.\r\n\r\nThis molybdena, from Shutesbury, is chiefly crystallized, and the\r\ncrystals are, in some instances, very distinct; their form is that\r\nof a flat six-sided prism, or what is commonly called a table.\r\nThe rock, from which they were obtained, is a granitic aggregate,\r\n(judging from the specimen sent, it may be a true granite) and the\r\nforms of the crystals are very distinctly impressed in the stone,\r\nso that when removed they leave an exact copy or crystal mould.\r\nIn a letter from the proprietor of the land, it is said that the\r\nmolybdena is found in a ledge of rocks, six or seven feet above the\r\nsurface of the earth, and about ten or twelve feet above the level\r\nof the water; the direction of the rocks is from S. to N. E. by N.;\r\nthe metal is in a vein, running E., and was discovered in small\r\npieces in the top of the ledge. After putting in two blasts, some\r\nlarge pieces were obtained.\r\n\r\nFrom this account, and from the specimens, (some of the crystals\r\nbeing an inch or more in length) this must be one of the most\r\ninteresting localities of molybdena hitherto observed in this\r\ncountry; and it is hoped Mr. Eaton will take some pains to procure\r\nand furnish specimens.\r\n\r\n_Rose Quartz._--From Southbury, Connecticut, not far from Woodbury,\r\nand from the Housatonick River, two young men, of the name of\r\nStiles, have brought us specimens of _rose quartz_, of delicate and\r\nbeautiful colour. It is said to be abundant in a ledge of the same\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n_Plumbago._--In Cornwall, Litchfield county, Connecticut, plumbago\r\nis found, of a good quality, and in considerable masses, in a vein\r\ncontained in a rock of gneiss, or mica-slate. It has been known\r\na good while, and is said to have been exported anterior to the\r\nAmerican revolutionary war.\r\n\r\n_Coal, &c._ in Zanesville, Ohio. Through the kindness of the Rev.\r\nDr. Bronson, Principal of the Cheshire Academy, we have received\r\nthe following information.--In cutting a canal in the above town,\r\nin the spring of 1817, through freestone, trees, and fish, and\r\nother substances, both animal and vegetable, were taken out, alike\r\npetrified to a freestone, excepting the bark of a beach tree, which\r\nwas very perfect and beautiful coal--(as we have had an opportunity\r\nof ascertaining, from an examination of the specimens.)\r\n\r\n_Coal_, in the county of Muskingum, Ohio. Common stone-coal,\r\nhighly bituminous, (the slaty or black coal of Werner,) is found\r\nabundantly.\r\n\r\n_South of Lake Erie_, about 25 miles, in the bed of Rocky\r\nRiver, are found shells, and other animal remains, imbedded in\r\nargillaceous iron; the specimens were collected in 1817, by the\r\nRev. R. Searle.\r\n\r\n_Mammoth's Tooth_, from the River St. Francis, west of Mississippi.\r\nReturn J. Meigs, Esq. has transmitted, through the Rev. E.\r\nCornelius, a mammoth's tooth, apparently not mineralized. It\r\nappears to have belonged to a very old animal, as the processes,\r\n(which, it is well known, are commonly very prominent) are worn\r\ndown smooth, and some of them almost obliterated.\r\n\r\n_Blue Ridge, Tennessee, and Mississippi Territory._--Through the\r\nkindness of the Rev. E. Cornelius, and of Mr. John H. Kain, we\r\nhave received a considerable collection of specimens, illustrative\r\nof the mineralogy and geology, and Indian antiquities of these\r\nregions; they may be, on a future occasion, the subject of more\r\nparticular remarks.\r\n\r\n_Coal_, in Suffield, Connecticut, on the river of the same name.\r\nFrom Mr. Nathan Stedman, we have received specimens of coal, found\r\nin thin veins, in rocks of slate, and argillaceous sandstone, on\r\nthe banks of the river. The veins are thin, but considerably\r\nnumerous; the coal is very glossy and black; breaks with a smooth\r\nand almost conchoidal fracture, and very much resembles jet.\r\nIt is very much intersected by thin veins--(not thicker than a\r\nknife-blade)--of white crystallized calcareous spar. This coal is\r\nbituminous, and burns pretty freely. It has not been explored,\r\nexcept superficially.\r\n\r\n_Coal_, in Southington, Connecticut. Beds of slate are found more\r\nor less bituminous; and, at the bottom of some of the wells, the\r\nslate begins to exhibit thin veins of coal, distributed in great\r\nnumbers through the substance of the slate, which is the shale of\r\nthe miners. The coal is from the thickness of a knife-blade to that\r\nof a finger; it is highly bituminous, and burns with great freedom.\r\nEven the entire masses of the stone burn brilliantly, when ignited\r\non a common fire; and, after exhaustion of the coally matter, leave\r\nthe slate of a grayish colour.\r\n\r\nThe locality from which the specimens were taken, is on the land of\r\nRoswell Moore, Esq. about midway between Hartford and New Haven.\r\nThe spot was lately examined by Col. Gibbs, Eli Whitney, Esq.\r\nProfessor Olmstead, and others; and arrangements are making to bore\r\nthe strata, to the depth of several hundred feet, if necessary.\r\nThese localities are in what may, with propriety, be called the\r\ncoal formation of Connecticut. Coal has been found in several other\r\nplaces in that state; and the peculiar geological features of the\r\nregion in which it is contained, are very interesting, and may\r\nhereafter be described in form.\r\n\r\n_Sulphat of Barytes, with Coal, &c._--Sulphat of barytes exists\r\nabundantly in Southington, on what is called the Clark Farm. With\r\nquartz, carbonate of lime, &c. it forms the gangue of a metallic\r\nvein, containing galena, or sulphuret of lead, copper pyrites,\r\n&c. The sulphat of barytes is more or less crystallized, and\r\nprincipally in the form that is called the coxcomb spar. The same\r\nvein, although it is in the side of a mountain, several hundred\r\nfeet above the flat country adjacent, and two or three miles from\r\nthe coal strata above mentioned, contains numerous spots and\r\npatches of coal, very much resembling that at Suffield. It is of\r\na most brilliant black, and contrasted with the white, stony\r\nmatrix, (principally quartz and sulphat of barytes) in which it is\r\nenveloped, it forms elegant specimens.\r\n\r\n_Scintillating Limestone._--In Vermont, a singular scintillating\r\nlimestone is found, of which an account is given in the following\r\nextract of a letter from Mr. George Chase, dated Randolph, February\r\n19, 1818.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The object of the present letter is to acquaint you with a\r\ncircumstance relating to the limestone that abounds in this\r\nprimitive country, which to me is inexplicable. This carbonate of\r\nlime is of a pale sky-blue colour; effervesces strongly with nitric\r\nacid; and, by burning, produces lime, so that there is no question\r\nas to the identity of the mineral. But it likewise gives forth\r\nsparks with steel:--this I concluded, at first, to be an accidental\r\ncircumstance; but every specimen that I have tried, from various\r\nquarters of the country, uniformly gives fire with steel. The\r\nlimestone is found in layers, in blocks, and masses, disseminated\r\namong the clay-slate that covers the greatest part of the townships\r\nin this vicinity. When first taken from the earth, and exposed to\r\nthe air, it is covered with an incrustation of a dark reddish-brown\r\ncolour, that crumbles easily between the fingers, and is generally\r\nfrom one inch to a foot in thickness. This incrustation, however,\r\nhardens on a long exposure to the air. This led me to think\r\nthat the incrustation was owing to the decomposition of the\r\nlimestone, which was produced by the sulphuret of iron, intimately\r\ndisseminated through the rock, which would also explain the\r\nsingular circumstance of its striking fire. But on dissolving a\r\nsmall quantity of the mineral in nitric acid, and adding a drop or\r\ntwo of the decoction of gallnut, no discolouring of the liquor was\r\nproduced.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limpid Quartz._--West Canada Creek, a northern branch of the\r\nMohawk, affords, in its sands, small crystals of quartz, limpid,\r\nand terminated at both ends by pyramids of six sides; we are\r\nindebted for specimens to Professor Fisher.\r\n\r\n_Fetid Primitive Limestone, &c._--From the vicinity of Williamstown\r\nCollege, through the kindness of Professor Dewey, we have received\r\nspecimens illustrative of the geology of that region. Among them\r\nis limestone from Stockbridge, crystallized in large plates and\r\nrhomboids, almost white, and still fetid on being rubbed, which is\r\nvery different from most fetid limestones, which are dark coloured,\r\nand even black, and do not belong to primitive formation.\r\n\r\n_Molybdena._--In Pettipaug, Saybrook, Connecticut, molybdena\r\noccurs. It is mentioned in the Review of Cleaveland's Mineralogy,\r\nand is here cited again for the purpose of pointing out its\r\nlocality more exactly. It is found about half a mile to the E. of\r\nthe Turnpike leading from Saybrook to Middletown, on the first\r\nroad on the right hand above the turnpike gate, near the house of\r\nthe widow Pratt. It is not far from Pettipaug meeting-house, in a\r\nnorthern direction.\r\n\r\n_Beryl._--In Haddam, Connecticut, are found many beryls, and\r\nsome of uncommon size; an account of one of the most remarkable\r\nlocalities is contained in the following memorandum from the Rev.\r\nMr. Mather, to whom we are indebted for specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The place in which the beryls are found is in the town of Chatham,\r\nabout one mile and a half north from Middle-Haddam landing; about\r\nhalf of a mile S. W. of a large hill, on which is the cobalt mine.\r\nThe rock in which the beryls are contained is granite; the parts of\r\nwhich are very large, especially the felspar and the mica. Large\r\nmasses of shorl are also found in these rocks. Beryls have also\r\nbeen found in other parts of Middle-Haddam, amongst rocks of the\r\nsame description. The _greatest_ diameter of the largest beryl is\r\nfour inches; the _least_ three inches. The beryls are numerous, and\r\nof different sizes; though few are less than an inch, or two inches\r\nin diameter. The length of the longest beryl is five inches.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clay._--Near Delhi, New-York, a few rods from the Delaware river,\r\nare found beds of clay, of which specimens have been transmitted by\r\nMr. John P. Foote, of New-York. We are of opinion that they are not\r\nporcelain clay.\r\n\r\n_Gypsum._--Cayuga Lake. We are informed by Dr. L. Foot, that the\r\nworkmen who have excavated about 20 feet on the border of the\r\nlake, in gypsum, which is generally of a dark brown, or black\r\ncolour, when they come to a transparent crystallized piece, call\r\nit isinglass, and reject it as worthless: the hint should be\r\nremembered by mineralogists, that the specimens may be saved for\r\ntheir cabinets.\r\n\r\n\r\nASBESTOS IN ANTHRACITE.\r\n\r\n_Extract of a letter from Dr. I. W. Webster._\r\n\r\n  BOSTON, 27th Nov. 1818.\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nIn examining some masses of the anthracite from Rhode Island,\r\none piece attracted my attention, from the waved structure of\r\nthe lamellæ into which it separated. The fragments of this were\r\nwedge-shaped, and I found the space between some of the laminæ\r\nfilled up by a fibrous, silky substance, which induced me to break\r\nup other masses, in one of which I discovered an abundance of\r\namianthus; the filaments are of a light-green colour in some parts\r\nof the mass--in others presenting different shades of brown. With\r\na microscope, I found the fibres intermixed with the anthracite;\r\nor forming thin layers, and these sometimes parallel to, at others\r\ncrossing, in different directions, the course of the laminæ. How\r\nfar the presence of this mineral may influence the ignition or\r\ncombustion of the coal, is a question, perhaps, worth determining.\r\nShould my engagements permit, I shall make further examination, and\r\ninform you. In the mean time, the notice of this fact may call the\r\nattention of some of your readers to the subject. At any rate, this\r\nsubstance has, I believe, never before been noticed in connexion\r\nwith anthracite, and is highly interesting in a geological point of\r\nview.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nWe have been familiar with the Rhode Island anthracite, and with\r\nthe formation of rocks in which it is found; and, long since,\r\nobserved the fact mentioned by Dr. Webster. The asbestos often is\r\nin the form of the most delicate amianthus, frequently blended also\r\nwith the slate rocks, which form the roof and pavement of this\r\ncoal. A specimen now lies before us, in which a complete vein of\r\nthis amianthus, with fibres nearly two inches _in length, connects\r\nand pervades_ a mass of slate, supposed to be of the transition\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nSimilar facts are mentioned also by Dr. Meade, in his account of\r\nthe Rhode Island coal.\r\n\r\n\r\nRED PYROXENE AUGITE.\r\n\r\n_Extract of a letter to the Editor, from Dr. H. H. Hayden of\r\nBaltimore._\r\n\r\nI have very lately discovered a couple of small specimens of the\r\ntransparent _red_ pyroxene, resembling fine crystals of titanium,\r\nwhich I, at first, mistook it for. One of them is contained in\r\nthe middle of a large crystal, like the rubellite in the green\r\ntourmalins of Massachusetts, but it is not the same substance. The\r\npyroxene, which I have reference to, is the olive-coloured epidote\r\nof some, pistazite of others, but resembles, in this instance, the\r\nsahlite; the crystals being divisible longitudinally. Some of them\r\nare five inches long, and half an inch diameter, hexaedral and\r\ndouble; that is, two joined together, as described by Brochant in\r\nparticular.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome other localities, of which we have received notices, may be\r\nmentioned in a future number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART.

By Dr._ ELI\r\nIVES, _Professor, &c. in the Medical Institution of Yale College_.\r\n(_With a Plate._)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plant, which is the subject of the following observations, is\r\nfound growing abundantly on the sandy plains east of Cedar Hill, in\r\nNew-Haven. It is locally associated with the asclepias viridiflora\r\nand verticillata. When this species of asclepias was first noticed\r\nby me, it was supposed to be a variety of viridiflora of Rafinesque\r\nand Pursh; but after examining a great number of specimens, it was\r\nfound that the varieties did not blend themselves. The leaves of\r\nthe viridiflora being uniformly oblong and obtuse, the leaves of\r\nthe other uniformly lanceolate and acute. To this new species I\r\npurpose to give the name Lanceolata.\r\n\r\n_Specific character of the asclepias lanceolata_:--Stem decumbent,\r\nhirsute; leaves opposite, lanceolate, acute, sub sessile,\r\nhirsuit umbels lateral, solitary, sessile, nodding, subglobose,\r\ndense-flowered; appendage none. See the plate.\r\n\r\nThe asclepias lanceolata is allied to the asclepias longifolia and\r\nviridiflora by the absence of appendage or horn of the nectary. It\r\nis distinguished from the longifolia, which is characterized by\r\nalternate linear leaves, and umbels erect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Asclepias lanceolata._]\r\n\r\nThe asclepias lanceolata and asclepias viridiflora belong to Mr.\r\nElliott's genus acerates. In both, the nectary or stamineous crown\r\nis short concave, and oppressed to the angles of the filaments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. VIII. _Description of a New Genus of American Grass._ DIPLOCEA\r\nBARBATA, by C. S. RAFINESQUE, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiplocea. _Generic definition._ Flowers paniculated monoical or\r\npolygamous. Exterior glumes membranaceous bivalve one to three\r\nflowered, valves subequal emarginated mutic. Anterior glumes\r\nbivalve unequal, the largest notched, notch aristated, the\r\nsmallest mutic entire bearded. _Additional characters._ Flowers\r\nwhen single sepile with a lateral jutting peduncle, when double,\r\none sepile and one pedunculated, when three two are pedunculated\r\nand alternate. The hermaphrodite and male flowers are similar: the\r\nfemale are nearly clandestine, inferior. Stamens 3, styles 2. Seeds\r\novate oblong.\r\n\r\n_Observations._ This genus is intermediate between _amphicarpon_,\r\nRaf. (_Milium amphicarpon_, _Pursh_) and _aira_, L. It differs from\r\nthis last by its polygamy, variable number of flowers, notched\r\nvalves, &c. The generic name means _double notch_. Its type is\r\nthe following species, which had been ranged with the _aira_, by\r\nWalter, and considered doubtful by Pursh.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Diplocea Barbata._\r\n\r\n_Specific definition._ Stems cespitose, articulations bearded;\r\nleaves rough glaucous, neck ciliated; panicles, few flowered,\r\nfemale axillary; largest valvet rinervate, and ciliated as well as\r\nthe awl.\r\n\r\n_Latin definition._ Caulibus cespetosis, geniculis barbatis, collo\r\nciliato, foliis scabris glaucis, paniculis paucifloris, femineis\r\naxillaribus; valva majore trinerva, aristaque ciliata.\r\n\r\n_Description._ Roots, annual fibrous: stems many, unequal, rather\r\nprocumbent at the base, next assurgent, rising one foot at utmost;\r\nthey are geniculated, slender, brittle, weak, and smooth. The knees\r\nor joints are bearded, the sheaths are split, the neck ciliated,\r\nthe leaves short, stiff, rough glaucous, linear acute, obscurely\r\nstriated. The panicles have few flowers, particularly the female\r\nones, which are axillary coarctated almost hidden, while the\r\nmale are terminal and divaricate: some hermaphrodite flowers are\r\noccasionally, but seldom found among both panicles; they are all\r\nsimilar, differing only in the want of stamina or pistils. The\r\nvalves of the exterior glumes are nearly equal oblong notched\r\nobtuse, mutic and oneneroed. The valvules or valves of the glumule\r\n(corolla or interior glume) are unequal, the largest is ciliated\r\ntrinerve bifid, with a soft ciliated awl in the notch, as long as\r\nthe valve: the small valve is ovate acute concave, very hairy on\r\nthe back. The colour of the flower is reddish or pale red; but\r\nvariable.\r\n\r\n_Observations._ This plant is probably the _aira purpurea_ of\r\nWalter, Pursh, Elliott, &c. but does not belong to that genus.\r\nIt was found in Carolina, but I have found it on Long-Island,\r\nnear Gravesend, Bath, Oyster-Bay, &c. on the sandy and gravelly\r\nsea-shore: it grows probably in the intermediate states. It\r\nblossoms in August and September, has no particular beauty, but\r\na very singular appearance. The specific name of _purpurea_ was\r\nimproper, since the colour of the flowers is variable from whitish\r\nto red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART.

X. _Notes on Herpetology, by_ THOMAS SAY, _of Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\n(Communicated by the Author.)\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I have not devoted a particular study to this department\r\nof the science of nature, yet I have been amused and instructed by\r\ncasually observing many of the subjects of it, when I have been\r\nrambling in their native haunts, pursuing objects more particularly\r\ninteresting to me.\r\n\r\nBut when perusing, the other day, the account of the copper-head\r\nof our country, by Mr. Rafinesque, I was impelled to ask for\r\ninformation on the subject, through your useful publication, in\r\nwhich that account appeared, and to make, at the same time, a few\r\nmiscellaneous remarks or notes. These are in part included in\r\nthe present essay, and if they should have a tendency to incite\r\nattention to the reptilia of the United States, at present in a\r\nstate of confusion and incertitude, some portion of benefit will be\r\nrendered to the great cause of science.\r\n\r\nI think that a moderate degree of labour and observation bestowed\r\nupon the investigation of the species already described, would\r\nprove the unity in nature of some species which have been\r\nconsidered as distinct by all the authors, would detect many errors\r\nin observation, expose some deceptions practised on credulity by\r\nthe designing, and would enable us to fix, with some degree of\r\naccuracy, our knowledge of truth and of the species.\r\n\r\nA work devoted particularly to this class, by some one adequate\r\nto the task, who could have in his view all the known species, is\r\nindeed a desideratum.\r\n\r\n_Scytale cupreus_, Copper-head, &c. of Mr. Rafinesque. I have\r\nalways considered the Copper-head to be no other than the\r\n_Cenchris mockeson_ of authors, and _Boa contortrix of Linn._\r\nv. Latr. Lacep. Shaw, Daudin, &c. _Agkistrodon mokasen_ of\r\nBeauvois; which opinion is not a little corroborated by an actual\r\ncomparison of one of these animals in Peale's Museum, with the\r\ndescriptions of the authors above mentioned. It may be objected\r\nto me, that the _mockeson_ of those naturalists is a _Cenchris_,\r\nand not a _Scytale_, therefore generically distinguished from\r\nthe Copper-head; but on the other hand, we know that the genus\r\n_Cenchris_ does not exist in nature, that the individual upon\r\nwhich it was founded, was either a fortuitous variety, or that\r\nthe illustrious naturalist was deceived by the desiccation of his\r\nspecimen, giving to the basal caudal plates a bifid aspect. That\r\nthe former was the case I analogically infer, from having seen,\r\nin the collection of the Academy of Natural Sciences, a _Coluber\r\nheterodon_, of which the fifth and sixth pairs of caudal scales\r\nwere entire, and not as usual bifid. An additional corroboration of\r\nthe truth of this inference is derived from the circumstance of the\r\n_Scytale_ of Peale's Museum, having the ten or eleven apical caudal\r\nplates bifid, precisely as in the genus _Acanthophis_, to which\r\nit seems closely affianced, and to which it would be referred if\r\nthis character was a permanent one. In every other character this\r\nspecimen coincides with the _S. mockeson_ of authors, and in every\r\nnecessary respect with the _S. cupreus_ of Mr. R. with the sole\r\nexception of the calcarate termination of the tail. This caudal\r\nhorn seems to approximate Mr. R's. animal to the _S. piscivorus_\r\nor true horn-snake, about which the credulous have so absurdly\r\nalarmed themselves, and which was arranged with the _Crotali_ by\r\nLacepede, in consequence of having a horn on the tail an inch long.\r\nWe find sometimes a small indurated tip to the tail of _Coluber\r\nmelanoleucus_,[33] at least upon some full grown specimens,\r\nformed by the elongation and appression of the terminal scales; a\r\nlarger one on that of the European viper, and of the _Acanthophis\r\ncerastes_, and _Brownii_. Mr. Peale's specimen certainly has not\r\nthe horn, but it has at the termination of the tail a scale\r\nsomewhat longer and more indurated than the others, the individual\r\nhad not attained his full growth. If then this species (and some\r\nothers) is subject to vary in the form of its caudal plates, from\r\nwhich the generic characters are in part estimated, may it not\r\nalso vary in the armature of the tail, which at most can only\r\nbe considered as specific. The Copper-belly is a very distinct\r\nspecies. If the _S. cupreus_ is, notwithstanding the above\r\nobservations, considered a distinct species, it would gratify those\r\nwho cultivate natural history, to have some good discriminative\r\ncharacters of it.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said and written about antidotes to the venomous\r\nbites of snakes, and Mr. Rafinesque enumerates over again several\r\nplants which have been said to be, and which he appears to believe\r\nto be specifics. If the case was my own, I would be very unwilling\r\nto rely upon either of the 20 or 30 medicinal plants, dubiously\r\nmentioned by the late Professor Barton, as reputed antidotes for\r\nthis poison. It would be more prudent to resort unhesitatingly to a\r\nmore certain remedy, in the ligature, and immediate excision of the\r\npart, where such an operation was practicable, or to cauterization,\r\nif the part could not be removed by the knife.\r\n\r\nIn conversation with Professor Cooper upon this subject, he\r\ninformed me that in his domestic medical practice he applied common\r\nchalk to the wounds occasioned by the stings of hymenopterous\r\ninsects. That in consequence of this mode of treatment, the pain\r\nwas immediately allayed, and the consequent inflammation and\r\nintumescence were prevented. The experiment which led to this\r\nresult was induced by the supposition that the venomous liquid\r\nmight be an acid, which opinion was, in some degree, justified by\r\nthe event.[34] Upon the same neutralizing principle it must be\r\nsupposed that any alkali would be beneficial. The learned Professor\r\nsupposed, that the venom of the poisonous reptilia may, in like\r\nmanner, be an acid secretion, and recommends this to be ascertained\r\nby experiments upon the liquid itself.\r\n\r\nIf this inference proves correct, the same alkaline remedy may be\r\nemployed to neutralize, or so modified as to stimulate, in case,\r\nas is supposed by some, the poison produces upon the system a\r\ntyphoid action.\r\n\r\nAn instance however is related in the Trans. Royal Soc. of Lond.\r\nof the unsuccessful administration of the vol. alkali in case of\r\nthe bite of a Rattle-snake; and an intelligent physician of Georgia\r\ninformed me, that he had applied the same stimulant in vain for the\r\ncure of the bites of poisonous snakes, but that being once stung by\r\na Scorpion, he was instantaneously relieved by the topical use of\r\nthis liquid. He further related to me a cure performed under his\r\nobservation, by means of the singular antidote, which has often\r\nbeen resorted to in case of snake bites, that of the application\r\nof a living domestic fowl or other bird directly to the wound;\r\nthree fowls were applied in this instance, of which two died in\r\na few minutes, it was supposed, by the poison extracted from the\r\nwound. This account, from an observant medical professor, (who\r\nmay nevertheless have been deceived) acquires some additional\r\ntitle to consideration by a similar event which lately occurred at\r\nSchooley's Mountain, New-Jersey. We are informed from a respectable\r\nsource, that a boy was there bitten by a Copper-head, (Scytale\r\nmockeson.)[35] The part was immediately painful, became swollen and\r\ninflamed, and the sufferer had every appearance of having received\r\na dangerous wound. A portion of the breast of a fowl was denudated\r\nof feathers, and applied to the wound; in a few minutes the fowl\r\ndied, without having experienced any apparent violence or injurious\r\npressure, from the hand of the applicant, the breast exhibiting a\r\nlivid appearance. Another living fowl was then laid open by the\r\nknife, and the interior of the body placed upon the wound. The\r\nwound was subsequently scarified, and variously administered to.\r\nThe boy however recovered, and his cure was generally attributed,\r\nat least in part, to the application of the birds. I am as far\r\nas any one from relying implicitly upon this mode of treatment,\r\nand would only resort to it when the part bitten could not be\r\nextirpated, and when a cautery was not at hand. Yet it must be\r\nconfessed, that from the numerous attestations to its efficacy we\r\nshould be almost led to suppose a very strong affinity to exist\r\nbetween the venom and the animal thus applied.\r\n\r\nThat so numerous a catalogue of plants have gained credit with the\r\nuninformed as specifics, will not be surprising, when we know that\r\nthe reservoir of the venom is very readily exhausted and slowly\r\nreplenished. When this reservoir is vacated, the reptile is of\r\ncourse innoxious, and the most inert plant would then stand a good\r\nchance of gaining reputation with the credulous as a specific.\r\n\r\nFor a similar reason we have so many cures for the bite of a rabid\r\nanimal; and it may be for a similar reason that the body of an\r\nanimal has acquired repute as an antidote, against the venom of a\r\nserpent.\r\n\r\n_Coluber trivittata_ of Mr. R. p. 80, of this work. Judging from\r\nthe descriptive name and the locality, is the _C. sirtalis_ of\r\nauthors, or possibly the _C. saurita_ or _C. ordinatus_. These\r\nserpents have each the three vittæ, though in the two former this\r\ntrait is much more striking. I know of no other serpent in our\r\nvicinity to which the name can be characteristically applied. The\r\n_ordinatus_ has been called _bipunctatus_ and _ibibe_ by the French\r\nschool. What is the difference between _sirtalis_ and _saurita_?\r\nthey must be very closely allied, if not synonymous.\r\n\r\n_Coluber getulus_, Lin. This species attains to a more considerable\r\nmagnitude than authors have stated. I saw a specimen on Cumberland\r\nIsland, Georgia, at least five feet long. The ground colour, by\r\nthe direction of light in which I viewed him, was deep glaucous\r\nor livid, he was much more robust than _C. Constrictor_.[36] He\r\npermitted my near approach, without agitating his tail in the\r\nmenacing manner of the serpent just mentioned, and of the crotali,\r\nor manifesting any signs of fear. In my anxiety to secure\r\nhim, he eluded my grasp, and by a sudden and rapid exertion,\r\ndisappeared, with all the rapidity of movement so remarkable in\r\nthe _constrictor_. This last, from his celerity, is known in many\r\ndistricts by the name of _Racer_.\r\n\r\n_Coluber heterodon._ This viperine species, of which Latreille has\r\nformed a genus under the name of _Heterodon_, varies considerably\r\nin its markings, and like most of our serpents, is not constant\r\nin the number of its plates and scales, (126, 48-138, 42-141, 42,\r\n&c.) perhaps too much reliance has been placed upon colour, and\r\nupon the number of the plates and scales beneath the body, of the\r\nOphidiæ generally. In the form of the anterior termination of the\r\nhead, the _heterodon_ is remarkable, and a good specific character\r\nmay be obtained from the orbital scales, which are eleven or twelve\r\nin number; the parabolic curve which passes through the eyes, and\r\nterminates at the maxillary angles, is also generally present.\r\nThis same serpent was figured in Deterville's ed. of Buffon, under\r\nthe name of _Coleuvre cannelee_. The _heterodon_ abounds in many\r\nsandy situations, and near the sea-shore. Several persons pursuing\r\na pathway, passed within a few inches of one of them without his\r\nbetraying any emotion, but the moment he perceived me advancing\r\nwith my eye fixed upon him, he with a sudden exertion assumed a\r\ndefensive attitude, by elevating the anterior portion of his body,\r\nflattening his head, and 3 or 4 inches length of his neck; these he\r\nwaved with a steady and oblique motion from side to side, uttering\r\nat the same time an audible sibilation, he made no attempt to\r\nescape, and seemed absolutely fearless until taken. They have the\r\nhabit of the vipera, but not the fangs. It seems to be synonymous\r\nwith _Coluber simus_. This species is often called _mockeson_.\r\nDr. Shaw's description of _Boa contortrix_ seems to indicate this\r\nspecies. Was he deceived by an erroneous reference to Catesby's\r\nfigure of this Hog-nose? or by Forster's catalogue?\r\n\r\n_Coluber punctatus._ A good diagnostic character of this species,\r\nin addition to the cervical cestus, rests in the triple series of\r\nabdominal dots; but these are often wanting or obsolete in the\r\nyoung specimen, in which state it is probably the _torquatus_ of\r\nShaw. Sometimes the dots are wanting on the neck and near the\r\ncloaca; and in one aged individual, the intermediate line occurred\r\ndouble, and confluent on the throat.\r\n\r\n_Coluber fulvius_, this species is said by Daudin to be closely\r\nallied to his _C. coccineus_, notwithstanding the difference in\r\nplates and scales. But it is certainly very distinct by other\r\ncharacters, and strikingly so in its perfectly annular black and\r\nred bands; the latter are margined with yellowish and spotted with\r\nblack. A specimen has 224 plates and 32 scales, total length 21\r\ninches, length of the tail 1-9/10 inch. The _coccineus_ has the\r\nunder part of the body whitish, immaculate. The _fulvius_ seems to\r\nbelong to the genus _vipera_; it has the fangs, but not the orifice\r\nbehind the nostril, which communicates with the reservoir of venom,\r\nso conspicuous in the _crotali_, &c.\r\n\r\n_Ophisaurus ventralis._ The tail of this snake not only breaks in\r\npieces when struck with a weapon, but portions of it are thrown\r\noff at the will of the serpent. This singular fact I witnessed in\r\nGeorgia. This is one of the many which are called horn-snakes. A\r\ntip of the tail of one of them was once brought to me as having\r\nbeen taken from a recently withered tree, which the bearer assured\r\nme was destroyed by the insertion of this formidable instrument,\r\nand it was not without considerable difficulty he was convinced of\r\nthe innocence of the tail, and of having been the dupe of a knave.\r\nThere seems to be a peculiar character in the mode of imbrication\r\nof the scales of this species, each one of these at the lateral\r\nedges, passes beneath the lateral scale on one side, and over\r\nthe edge of the opposite one. It has been described under five\r\ndifferent generic names, and four different specific ones.\r\n\r\nThe _Crotali_ do not gain a single joint only to the rattle\r\nannually, as is generally supposed. They gain more than one\r\neach year, the exact number being probably regulated in a great\r\nmeasure by the quantity of nourishment the animal has received.\r\nRattle-snakes in Peale's Museum have been observed to produce 3\r\nor 4 in a year, and to lose as many from the extremity during the\r\nsame time. Hence it is obvious, that the growth of these curious\r\nappendages is irregular, and that the age of an individual cannot\r\nbe determined from their number. Mr. Rubens Peale informed me, that\r\na female of _Crotalus horridus_, Beauv. _durissus_, Daud. which\r\nlived in his Museum more than fourteen years, had eleven joints to\r\nher rattle when first in his possession; that several joints were\r\nacquired and lost annually, and that at her death, which occurred\r\nlast year, she had the same number as when brought to the Museum;\r\nshe had, however, during that time received an accession of four\r\ninches to her length. Her death was occasioned by an abortion.\r\n\r\nThe _C. adamanteus_, Beauvois. _Rhombifer_, Daud. is by much the\r\nlargest of our North American serpents, and doubtless is the\r\nspecies which Catesby saw a specimen of, eight feet long.\r\n\r\n_Crotalus miliarius_ varies in some characters from those laid\r\ndown by authors. A specimen within my view has five dorsal series,\r\nof alternate, irregularly orbicular black spots, those of the\r\nintermediate series are obsolete, and slightly connected across\r\nthe back, those of the vertebral series have not red centres,\r\nand are edged with a white line; the ventral spots are disposed\r\nadventitiously, so as not to be traced into longitudinal series;\r\nthey are large, black, irregularly orbicular, and occupy about one\r\nhalf of the surface, which is white. Ventral plates 140; subcaudal,\r\n33, of which the six terminal ones are bifid. Joints of the rattle\r\nwith but one transverse contraction on the middle of each, besides\r\nthe terminal contraction. Total length 1 foot 4¼ inches, tail two\r\ninches. It appears to be more vindictive than the two species\r\nbefore mentioned. The individual here noticed we encountered in\r\nEast Florida; he struck at Mr. W. Maclure and myself successively\r\nas we passed by him, without any previous intimation of his\r\npresence, owing to the inaudible smallness of his rattle, and its\r\nhaving but three joints; he was killed by Mr. T. Peale, (whom we\r\npreceded) while preparing for another assault. This incident is\r\nnoted as a contrast to the anecdote of the _Coluber heterodon_.\r\n\r\n_Salamandra alleganiensis_, Daud. appears to be synonymous with _S.\r\ngigantea_ of Dr. Barton. It was first described by Mr. Latreille\r\nin Deterv. Ed. of Buffon, tom. 11. The name _alleganiensis_,\r\nalthough defective, as it indicates no character, has however the\r\nunalienable right of priority.\r\n\r\n_Salamandra subviolacea_, Barton. This name has been rejected by\r\nMr. Daudin, and substituted by that of _venenosa_, I do not know\r\nfor what reason, as none is assigned.\r\n\r\n_Salamandra punctata_, Gmel. This appellation was originally given\r\nand restricted to the _stelio_ of Catesby. tab. 10. (represented\r\nin the bill of Ardea Herodias) and was adopted by many subsequent\r\nauthors, but was finally rejected by Daudin, who considered\r\nthe species the same as Barton's _subviolacea_. He concurred\r\nwith Mr. Latreille in appropriating the name thus rejected to\r\n_var. β_ of _Lacerta_, _aquatica_ of Gmel. Notwithstanding this\r\nhigh authority I cannot but coincide with Professor Barton in\r\nthis instance, in believing it altogether distinct. The single\r\ncharacter of the subocellate spots, though not remarked by this\r\nauthor, is a sufficiently discriminative one; these ocellæ are\r\nalways present, and in no one of the varieties I have seen has\r\nthe approximation to the _subviolacea_ been so considerable as to\r\nrender a specific discrepance equivocal. Catesby's variety with\r\nthe ocellæ on the tail seems to be the least common; in general\r\nthese spots, or epupillate ocellæ, are exclusively confined to a\r\nline on each side of the back, about six in each, extending from\r\nthe base of the head to the origin of the tail, though there are\r\nsometimes scattered smaller ones on each side of the body, and upon\r\nthe vertex of the head, they are of a beautiful reddish colour,\r\nenclosed by a definite black areola; the upper part of the body\r\nis brownish, with numerous, distant black points, and a slight\r\nvertebral, obtuse carina, the inferior surface of the body of a\r\nfine yellow or orange, with distant black points, the tail[37] is\r\ncompressed, ancipital, attenuated to an obtuse tip, longer than\r\nthe body, and punctured with black in like manner. The younger\r\nspecimens vary considerably, in being, on many parts of the body,\r\ndestitute of black punctures, and in having the dorsal and ventral\r\ncolour, of the same pale orange. It is decidedly aquatic. Several\r\nspecimens are preserved in the collection of the Academy of Natural\r\nSciences, and from these it is evident that the reddish colour of\r\nthe subocellate spots is destroyed by the action of the antiseptic\r\nliquid; to this circumstance it is probably owing that these spots\r\nhave been hitherto described as white.\r\n\r\nAfter stating these differential traits, it may be proper to\r\nobserve, that the _S. maculata_ of Shaw is synonymous with the\r\nabove. But I think it most proper to restore Gmelin's name\r\n_punctata_, which will afford an opportunity to do justice to the\r\nmemory of Laurenti, by reviving the original name by which he\r\ndistinguished the _Var. β. of Lacerta_, _aquatica_, Gmel., that of\r\n_parisinus_.\r\n\r\n_Bufo cornuta._ This animal, which has been stigmatized as\r\nthe most prodigiously deformed _creature_ known to exist!! is\r\ngenerally supposed to inhabit North America as well as Surinam.\r\nI do not think it has ever been found in North America. Shaw, in\r\nNodder's Nat. Misc. says it is principally found in Virginia, but\r\nin his General Zoology, I think he says that Seba was in error\r\nwhen he represented its native country to be North America. Two\r\nother species of _Bufo_ have been correctly stated to inhabit\r\nthis country, viz. _B. musicus_, and _Crapaud rougeâtre_, Daud.\r\n(B. rubidus) first noticed as distinct by Mr. William Bartram. I\r\ndiscovered a third species on the banks of St. John's river, East\r\nFlorida, which, as I am not at present prepared to describe, I\r\nshall not surreptitiously name.\r\n\r\nIt is, I conceive, an incumbent duty on the describer of a natural\r\nobject, to deposit his specimen, or a duplicate, when practicable,\r\nin some cabinet or museum, to which he should refer, in order\r\nthat subsequent writers may be satisfied with the accuracy of his\r\nobservations, by examining for themselves. By such reference, and\r\nby the re-examination of the same objects by others, the plethoric\r\nredundance of synonyma, that prolific source of accumulating error,\r\nwill be banished or elucidated, and naturalists will most readily\r\narrive at the knowledge of truth, which is, or ought to be, the\r\ngrand leading object of their labours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XI. _Outline of a Theory of Meteors._\r\n\r\n_By_ WM. G. REYNOLDS, M.D. _Middletown Point, New-Jersey_.\r\n\r\n\r\nShould the progress of science, for a century to come, keep\r\npace with its rapid advancement for the last fifty years, many\r\nappearances in the physical world, now enveloped in obscurity, will\r\nthen admit of as easy solution as the combustion of inflammable\r\nsubstances, or any familiar process in chemistry does at this\r\nday. Among the many subjects from which the veil of mystery would\r\nthus be raised, we may include those luminous appearances, in the\r\naerial regions, called meteors, which I am about to consider in the\r\nfollowing essay; and which seem to constitute a distinct class of\r\nbodies of considerable variety.\r\n\r\nMeteors were regarded by the ancients as the sure prognostics\r\nof great and awful events in the moral and physical world; and\r\nwere divided by them into several species, receiving names\r\ncharacteristic of the various forms and appearances they assumed;\r\nbut of their opinions, as to the physical cause of these phenomena,\r\nthe ancients have left us nothing solid or instructive. The\r\nmoderns, more enlightened, have ceased to regard these bodies with\r\nthe superstitious awe of former ages; but in respect to the cause\r\nthereof, are perhaps but little in advance of their predecessors,\r\nhaving, I believe, produced nothing yet that will bear the test of\r\nphilosophical investigation.\r\n\r\nDoctor Blagden (Philosophical Transactions, 1784,) considers\r\nelectricity as the general cause of these phenomena; Doctor\r\nGregory, and others, think they depend upon collections of highly\r\ninflammable matter, as phosphorus, phosphorated hydrogen, &c. being\r\nvolatilized and congregated in the upper regions of the air.\r\nDoctor Halley ascribes them to a fortuitous concourse of atoms,\r\nwhich the earth meets in her annual track through the ecliptic;\r\nand Sir John Pringle seems to regard them as bodies of a celestial\r\ncharacter, revolving round centres, and intended by the Creator\r\nfor wise and beneficent purposes, perhaps to our atmosphere, to\r\nfree it of noxious qualities, or supply such as are salutary. Many\r\nother theories, as ingenious as fanciful, might be enumerated; but\r\nwithout commenting on their comparative merit, I must acknowledge\r\nthat none of them have yet impressed my mind with a conviction of\r\ntheir truth. A series of observations, however, have enabled the\r\nmoderns to ascertain, with apparent accuracy, several particulars\r\nrelative to these stupendous bodies, which add much to our\r\nknowledge of their general character:--their velocity, equal to\r\n30, and even 40 miles in a second of time; their altitude, from 20\r\nto 100 miles; and their diameter, in some instances, more than a\r\nmile, are facts we derive from respectable authority, and may aid\r\nus, essentially, in forming just conceptions of their nature and\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nI believe meteoric stones to result from all meteoric explosions;\r\nlimiting, however, the term meteor to those phenomena, in the\r\nhigher regions of the air, denominated fire-balls, shooting-stars,\r\n&c. That these bodies move in a resisting medium, must be\r\nevident to every attentive observer; and that this medium is our\r\natmosphere, is pretty certain, 1st. Because we know of no other\r\nresisting medium round the earth; 2dly. Because the same kind of\r\nresistance is apparent at every intermediate altitude, from their\r\ngreatest to their least, which last we know to be far within our\r\natmospheric bounds; and, 3dly. Calculation has, in no instance,\r\nassigned them an elevation beyond the probable height of the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThat meteors proceed from the earth, that they arise from certain\r\ncombinations of its elements with heat, and that meteoric\r\nstones are the necessary result of the decompositions of these\r\ncombinations, are opinions I will endeavour to support, by the\r\nfollowing considerations.\r\n\r\n1st. The properties and habitudes of matter, under certain\r\nconditions and combinations.\r\n\r\n2dly. The situation of the earth's surface in respect to the sun,\r\nthe influence of his rays thereon, and the nature of the elements\r\nor compounds on which these rays act:\r\n\r\nAnd 3dly. The identity that exists between the component parts of\r\nmeteoric stones, and the elements that enter abundantly into the\r\ncomposition of our globe; and, by several other facts and arguments.\r\n\r\nUnder my first general specification, I will select such principles\r\nfrom the established doctrines of philosophy, as have an immediate\r\nbearing on the subject; without engaging in any of those subtle\r\nspeculations in which certain recondite properties of matter, or\r\nthe identities of quality and body are affirmed or denied.\r\n\r\nThus, 1st. Heat is the universal cause of fluidity and volatility\r\nin bodies; hence no solid can assume the state of gas, until it\r\nabsorbs, or unites with, a certain portion of caloric; and the\r\nsubtilty and volatility of compounds thus formed, will be in a due\r\nratio to the quantity of caloric they employ.\r\n\r\n2dly. The heat employed to maintain a body in the gaseous state,\r\nis said to be latent or fixed, and may be regarded as an ocean or\r\natmosphere of fire, holding the ultimate particles of the body in a\r\nstate of extreme division, and wide separation, from which they can\r\nbe driven only by some change in the affinities or condition of the\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\n3dly. If the latent heat in a gaseous compound be suddenly\r\nabstracted, as in explosion, its escape is attended with the\r\nemission of light and sensible heat, when the volatilized particles\r\nheld in solution being no longer able to maintain the state of gas,\r\nsuffer approximation in a due proportion to the quantity of caloric\r\nthey have lost.\r\n\r\n4thly. Caloric, in reducing solids to the state of gas, lessens,\r\nbut cannot in any case, as far as we know, totally destroy their\r\ngravitating force; the diminution of this force, however, being\r\nin a direct proportion to the quantity of heat employed.--Hence\r\nthe following inferences may be fairly drawn, as they seem to\r\nbe in unison with the relative dependence and harmony existing\r\nbetween the material elements of this globe, and, I believe, are\r\ncontradicted by no direct experiments; viz. that the expansion of\r\nvolume, specific levity, and subtilty of artificial gases, are in a\r\ndirect proportion to the absolute quantity of caloric they employ;\r\nand the caloric is in the same proportion to the insolubility of\r\nthe substance with which it unites.\r\n\r\n5thly. When the specific gravity of bodies on the surface of the\r\nearth, is reduced below that of the superincumbent atmosphere, they\r\nascend to media of their own density, in obedience to the laws of\r\nAerostatics; thus we raise balloons by filling them with light air,\r\nand the carbon of pit coal and common wood exposed to combustion,\r\nand water to the sun's rays, will rise until they reach a medium of\r\nlike specific gravity with themselves.\r\n\r\n6thly. Mechanical agitation and division assist the solution of\r\nsolids, by bringing fresh portions of the menstruum into successive\r\ncontact with their fragments, and thus exposing a larger surface.\r\n\r\nUnder the second head I proceed to notice the situation of the\r\nearth's surface in respect to the sun, &c. The atmosphere is\r\na thin, elastic, gravitating fluid, that completely envelopes\r\nthe earth, to which it may be considered a kind of appendage or\r\nexternal covering; its base resting on the earth's surface, is of\r\nan uniform density, growing rare as it recedes therefrom, in a due\r\nratio to the diminution of its gravitating force, until it is lost\r\nin empty space. The atmosphere is estimated on certain data to be\r\nabout 44 or 45 miles high, but we have good reasons to believe it\r\nfills a much wider circle, though too thin to reflect the rays of\r\nlight above its reputed height.\r\n\r\nThe earth presents one whole hemisphere to the sun in unerring\r\ndaily succession; and those parts of it which have the least\r\nprotection against his rays, will, cæteris paribus, suffer the\r\ngreatest intensity of their action. Within the tropics, the\r\natmosphere opposes less resistance to the sun's rays than in the\r\ntemperate zones; and in both large tracts of cultivated land,\r\nthe summits and sides of great ranges of mountains, margin of\r\noceans, rivers, &c. present an almost naked surface to their\r\ninfluence.[38] The exterior strata of the earth, and especially the\r\nmore exposed parts thereof, envelope in their compounds, elements\r\nof an identity of character with those composing meteoric stones.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere is the great recipient of all volatilized bodies;\r\nit possesses but feebly the powers of a solvent, unaided by heat\r\nor moisture, but when these are adjuvants, no body in nature can\r\ntotally resist their action for a long time.\r\n\r\nNow if the above principles are admitted, we have in their\r\napplication a reasonable solution of most meteoric phenomena.\r\nThus, the rays of the sun darting through the atmosphere reach\r\nthe surface of the earth, where, by accumulation, they produce\r\nsensible heat, which though not intense, is steady and uniform, for\r\nmany hours every day; minute portions of the earthy and metallic\r\ncompounds exposed to the sun's influence, will be volatilized by\r\nthe absorption of heat, and thereby assuming the state of elastic\r\nfluids, will ascend until they arrive at media of their own\r\ndensity. The atmosphere in contact, will have some of its particles\r\nblended in these compounds, will ascend with them, and to supply\r\nthe vacuum, new portions of air will rush in and ascend, and the\r\nprocess will continue until the sun's rays are withdrawn, or\r\ninterrupted by some of the common occurrences of nature.\r\n\r\nThe utmost height to which these elastic fluids ascend, may be\r\nestimated at something more than one hundred miles; and they float\r\nat every intermediate distance between their greatest elevation\r\nand the clouds, but rarely below the latter, except their course\r\nis directed towards the earth in their explosions. They probably\r\nascend at first in small daily detached portions of gaseous\r\nclouds, and are diffused over wide regions; but having no sensible\r\nresistance opposed to their mutual attraction, they will by the\r\nlaws of their affinities congregate into immense volumes of highly\r\nconcentrated elastic fluids, which on exploding will exhibit all\r\nthe phenomena of bursting meteors in the following manner, viz.\r\nthe latent heat on escaping will manifest itself in the form of\r\nfire and light, the force with which it strikes the atmosphere,\r\nor the rebound of the latter to fill the vacuum, or both, will\r\noccasion sound more or less detonating or hissing, as the escape is\r\nmore sudden, or the atmosphere more dense; the earthy and metallic\r\nparticles on the escape of caloric, will obey the laws of cohesive\r\nattraction, clash together, recover their gravity, and descend to\r\nthe earth in masses, or shattered fragments.\r\n\r\nMeteoric stones frequently bear the marks of violence, which\r\nis doubtless owing to the conflict sustained at the moment of\r\nexplosion; their difference in size depends on the difference\r\nof magnitude in the disploding volumes; something like regular\r\narrangement is frequently perceived in the structure of these\r\nstones, because in all productions of solid from fluid matter, the\r\nconsolidating particles possess a tendency to arrange themselves in\r\nthe order of their affinities. It is thus the various arrangements\r\nin saline crystallization, the freezing of water, and cooling of\r\nmelted metals, may be accounted for. There is a real, as well as an\r\napparent difference in the velocity of meteoric bodies; the first\r\narising from their difference of magnitude and the violence of the\r\nexplosion, as well as from the resistance they meet; the latter,\r\nfrom the different distances at which they are seen. The gradation\r\nof colour, from a bright silvery hue to a dusky red, is owing,\r\nin a certain degree, to the state of the atmosphere refracting\r\ndifferent coloured rays, and also to the materials in the compound,\r\nsimilar to the different hues in artificial fireworks. Reddish and\r\nwhite nebicula are sometimes left in the tracks of meteors, which\r\nare nothing but ignited vapours, or the particles brushed off the\r\nburning body by the resisting atmosphere. The velocity or motion\r\nand direction of meteors, depend upon principles well known and\r\ndaily practised by engineers, and the constructors of fireworks.\r\n\r\nThe immediate cause of these explosions is a little obscure, and\r\nmerits a fuller detail than is compatible with my present limits;\r\ntheir analogy to the electric phenomena in the clouds, leaves\r\nroom to suppose they are effected by certain modifications of\r\nelectricity. Clouds of opposite electricities will approach each\r\nother and explode, by the positive imparting as much electrical\r\nfire to the negative cloud as will make them equal, when just as\r\nmuch water as the imparted fire held in solution, will be set at\r\nliberty and descend to the earth. If, however, this solution be\r\ndeemed inapplicable, perhaps the following may be admitted. Thus,\r\nwhen heat is urged upon incombustible[39] bodies with a force\r\nthat overcomes the cohesive property by which their particles\r\nare tied together, it unites with them in large quantities, and\r\nbecomes latent, by which union they are reduced to the state of\r\nelastic fluids; and as it is a universal property of heat to\r\ncounteract the gravitating force of bodies, these compounds must\r\nnecessarily become volant, and ascend as above stated. It is only\r\nthermometrical or sensible heat, that destroys the attraction of\r\ncohesion existing between the particles of bodies, the repulsive\r\npower of latent heat being barely able to counteract this property,\r\nwhen the elements under its dominion are removed beyond a certain\r\ndistance from each other; now the very reduced temperature in the\r\nhigh regions to which these gaseous clouds will ascend, may admit\r\ntheir earthy and metallic particles within the sphere of cohesive\r\nor aggregative attraction, when the caloric will be expelled like\r\nwater from a sponge, accompanied by all the phenomena above stated.\r\n\r\nThe third general head of my subject leads me to inquire into the\r\nconstituent principles of meteoric stones: sundry papers on the\r\nanalysis of these productions, have been furnished us by chemists\r\nof acknowledged reputation and ability, and in none of these that\r\nI have seen, was there any element described that had not been\r\npreviously known. But should it hereafter be found that air stones\r\ncontain matters not found on our globe, the fact will afford no\r\nabsolute proof of the foreign origin of these stones, as we are\r\nsuccessively discovering earthy and metallic principles of distinct\r\ncharacters from those already known.\r\n\r\nA portion of one of these stones that fell in the town of Weston,\r\n(Connecticut) examined by the late Dr. Woodhouse, gave the\r\nfollowing results in a hundred parts, viz.\r\n\r\n  Silex        50\r\n  Iron         27\r\n  Sulphur       7\r\n  Magnesia     10\r\n  Nickel        1 inferred from chemical tests.\r\n  Loss          5\r\n             ----\r\n              100\r\n\r\n\"The sulphur was seen by the naked eye distributed through the\r\nsilex in round globules the size of a pin's head, after dissolving\r\nthe powdered stone in diluted nitric acid.\"\r\n\r\nAll specimens of these stones do not afford precisely similar\r\nresults, but differ in their constituent elements and relative\r\nproportions; their component parts, however, are to be found\r\nabundantly in schist, schorl, pyrites, pebble, granite, &c. on\r\nwhich the sun must daily act.\r\n\r\nThe following facts go to strengthen the above theory, viz.\r\nMeteors are most frequent and stupendous in tropical countries,\r\nwhere the heat of the sun is most intense; and less frequent in\r\nour climate in the winter and spring, while, and after the earth\r\nhas been covered with snow for many weeks in succession; and they\r\nare most frequent in the higher latitudes towards autumn, after\r\na continuation of hot dry weather: out of the whole number (179)\r\nof shooting stars I have noted during the last twelve years, 149\r\nappeared between June and December, inclusive.\r\n\r\nIf it be said that the specific gravity of meteoric stones being\r\nseveral times that of water, it is absurd to suppose they can rise,\r\n(if even reduced to the state of gas) to the elevated stations here\r\nassigned them, seeing the vapours of water can ascend only one or\r\ntwo miles above the earth. To this I reply, that the doctrine of\r\nheat is not yet so thoroughly understood, as to acquaint us with\r\nall its habitudes with natural bodies, but we infer from analogy,\r\nthat the more refractory a body is in the fire, the greater in\r\na due ratio is the absolute quantity of heat required to reduce\r\nit to, and retain it in, the state of gas, and the greater, in\r\na corresponding degree, will be the dilatation of its particles\r\nand decrease of its specific gravity. Hence, if water reduced to\r\nvapour by heat, be capable of assuming an altitude of two miles, it\r\nfollows that more refractory substances reduced to a similar state,\r\nwill suffer expansion and fugacity in a due proportion to the\r\nquantity of caloric they employ, and will assume a corresponding\r\nelevation, as already inferred under my first head.\r\n\r\nAnother objection may be, that though high degrees of heat affect\r\ncertain solids as above stated, yet these cannot be sensibly acted\r\non by such feeble agents as atmospheric air and the rays of the\r\nsun. I answer, if it be admitted that sensible heat acts on solids\r\nin an increasing ratio to its intensity, it follows that lower\r\ndegrees, though acting in an inverse ratio to higher, must affect\r\nthe same bodies in a conceivable degree at any temperature above\r\ntheir natural zero:[40] and though the heat of the sun beating on\r\na plane surface for several hours is feeble, compared with that\r\nproduced by a burning lens, or air furnace, yet if it be sufficient\r\nto detach from one square foot of the earth's surface the 104023\r\npart of a grain in twenty-four hours, the quantity taken from 100\r\nsquare miles, in the same time and proportion, would amount to ten\r\npounds, which is abundantly sufficient for all meteoric phenomena;\r\nand the loss to each square foot, supposing the process to be\r\nuninterrupted, would be no more than one grain in 284 years. When\r\nwe advert to the intense heat produced by concentrating a few of\r\nthe sun's rays in a burning lens, the whole quantity daily sent\r\nto the earth must strike us forcibly. If collected in a lens of\r\nsufficient magnitude, they might volatilize a space equal to the\r\nstate of New-York in a moment of time! As all bodies possess a\r\nlimited capacity for heat, does it not follow that there must be\r\nsome outlet to its perpetual accession to our globe, or the earth\r\nwould soon become so highly ignited as to glow with the fulgour of\r\na meteor? And may not this outlet be found in the above described\r\ncompounds? which serve as conductors of the surplus of heat from\r\nthe earth to the higher regions of the air, where on being freed\r\nby displosion, from the grosser matters incumbering it, it finds\r\na rapid passage to its great archetype and parent, the SUN. Thus\r\nhis daily waste may be restored, and an equilibrium, by the return\r\nof his own emanated particles, preserved, between the sun and the\r\nearth, and probably all the planets of our system.\r\n\r\nThe last consideration I shall offer in favour of the domestic or\r\nearthly origin of meteoric phenomena, is the difficulties that\r\npresent to our granting them a foreign one. Though I am well aware\r\nof the respectability of the names which the theory of moonstones\r\ncan summon to its support, yet I have always regarded it as\r\nunfounded and unphilosophical for the following reasons, viz. 1st.\r\nWhether the moon has an atmosphere or not, we will all admit that\r\nshe has attraction, which must extend to many thousands of miles\r\nfrom her surface. No projectile force that we are acquainted with\r\ncan throw a heavy body 100 miles, even though no atmospheric,\r\nor other resistance than its own gravity, were present; hence\r\nthe idea of that force extending to thousands of miles from the\r\nmoon's surface, is gratuitous and nugatory. 2dly. The products of\r\nvolcanoes bear no similarity of origin, or kindred resemblance to\r\nmeteoric stones; those are lavas of different kinds, pumicestone,\r\nscoria, ashes, &c. these solid masses of matter, with some degree\r\nof regularity in the arrangement of their constituent particles.\r\n3dly. The descent of these stones has no coincidence in point of\r\ntime with the position of the moon. She is as often in their nadir\r\nas their zenith. We also witness in all cases, explosion and light\r\nin our own atmosphere, at the time of the descent of these stones.\r\nThis could not be the case if they proceeded from the moon, for\r\nobvious reasons. 4thly. The heat adequate to such projectile force\r\nas would carry a body from the moon's surface beyond the sphere of\r\nher attraction, would volatilize the matter of meteoric stones in a\r\nmoment; hence they would not be projected from the Lunarian crater\r\nin solid masses, but in elastic vapour.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although the theory which I have endeavoured to\r\nelucidate and establish, be subject to some difficulties and\r\nobjections which science may hereafter remove, it appears to me\r\nperfectly consonant with the relative dependence and harmony of our\r\nsystem, and by no means at variance with the infinite wisdom and\r\npower by which it was originated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XII. _Observations upon the prevailing Currents of Air in\r\nthe State of Ohio and the Regions of the West, by_ CALEB ATWATER,\r\n_Esq. of Circleville, Ohio; in Letters addressed to His Excellency\r\nDe Witt Clinton, LL. D. Governor of the State of New-York, and\r\nPresident of the Literary and Philosophical Society_.\r\n\r\n(Communicated for the American Journal of Science, &c.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Circleville, Ohio, July 23, 1818._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nWith pleasure, I acknowledge the receipt of the circular letter\r\nbearing date the 5th instant, which you addressed to me, for which\r\nyou will be pleased to accept my warmest acknowledgments for\r\nyourself personally, and the Philosophical Society of which you are\r\nthe president. To answer all the questions which are put to me in\r\nthat letter, is not at present within my limited means, either as\r\nit respects the leisure or the ability. I shall therefore, at this\r\ntime, confine myself to \"observations upon the prevailing currents\r\nof air in the state of Ohio.\"[41] These observations will be wholly\r\nfounded on personal experience, during the four years in which I\r\nhave traversed this state, from Lake Erie to the Ohio river, whilst\r\nattending on the several courts, in all seasons and in all the\r\nchanges of weather.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing currents of air, one of which generally obtains in\r\nOhio, are three.\r\n\r\nThe first comes from the Mexican Gulf, ascending the Mississippi\r\nand its larger tributary branches quite to their very sources.\r\n\r\nThe second proceeds from the back of mountains to the west,\r\ndescends the Missouri to its mouth, and then spreads over a vast\r\nextent of country.\r\n\r\nThe third comes down the great northern and northwestern lakes to\r\nthe south end of Lake Michigan and the southern shore of Lake Erie,\r\nwhere it spreads over the region of country lying to the south of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThat current of air which comes from the Mexican Gulf, is warmer,\r\nand perhaps more moist, than any other which prevails here. After a\r\nfew days prevalence, it uniformly brings rain along with it. That\r\nthis current of air should be very warm may be readily conceived,\r\nwhen we reflect that it comes from a hot tropical region; and\r\nthat it should be very moist, excites no surprise, when it is\r\nconsidered, that in its passage upwards it passes wholly over\r\nwater, and through the warm mists and fogs constantly ascending\r\nfrom the Mississippi and its tributaries. This current prevails\r\nmuch more along the Ohio river than it does at any considerable\r\ndistance from it. One consequence is, that the climate in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the Ohio river is warmer, than it is either\r\nnorth or south of it, unless you go to the southward a considerable\r\ndistance. Other causes may, and probably do, in a greater or less\r\ndegree, contribute to produce this result, and I will here state\r\nthem:\r\n\r\nFirst, The Ohio runs on a surface less elevated above the sea than\r\nthe country, either north or south of it, but this difference\r\nis trifling through the whole of the sandstone formation. This\r\nformation prevails from the head of the Ohio to Aberdeen, which\r\nis opposite to Marysville in Kentucky, at least two-thirds of the\r\ndistance which that river washes the southern shore of this state.\r\nThe reason is obvious, because there are no falls in a sandstone\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nAnother cause which contributes to produce a warmer climate,\r\nespecially in the winter season, in the valley of the Ohio, is,\r\nthat several considerable streams which empty themselves into the\r\nOhio, have their sources on the highlands, a great distance to the\r\nsouth of it; for instance, the Great and Little Sandy, and the\r\nGreat and Little Kenhawa, which descending from a warm region of\r\ncountry, their waters contribute to keep the Ohio open in winter.\r\n\r\nBut these causes are by no means sufficient to produce the one half\r\nof the comparative warmth of climate observable in the immediate\r\nvicinity of this invaluable river. To prove that the climate is\r\nmuch milder in the southern than in the northern part of this\r\nstate, I will proceed to mention several facts, which have fallen\r\nunder my own observation.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of last February I was at the town of Delaware,\r\non the Whetstone Branch of the Scioto river, between eighty and\r\nninety miles south of Lake Erie, and twenty-five miles north of\r\nColumbus, the seat of government, which is near the centre of the\r\nstate, where I saw a number of gentlemen direct from Detroit,\r\nby the way of Lower Sandusky, who informed me that the snow at\r\nthat time was eighteen inches in depth and upwards all along the\r\nlake shore, but gradually decreased as they came south until\r\nthey arrived at Delaware. At that place it was then about twelve\r\ninches deep in the open fields, and somewhat deeper in the woods.\r\nI descended the road along the Whetstone to Columbus, the snow\r\ndecreasing in depth all the way as I proceeded. At Columbus it\r\nwholly disappeared in the fields, and only ice was found in the\r\nroad, which also decreased until I came to the Big Walnut Creek,\r\nthirteen miles south of Columbus, where it disappeared, and the\r\nroad began to be muddy. As I still proceeded south, the mud\r\nincreased in depth until I came to Chillicothe, about thirty-two\r\nmiles south of Big Walnut, where the frost was entirely out of\r\nthe ground, and the roads were almost impassable. As I still\r\ndescended southward, along the Scioto, I found that at Piketon,\r\non the Scioto, nineteen miles south of Chillicothe, the road had\r\nconsiderably improved. I proceeded onwards to Portsmouth on the\r\nOhio river, at the mouth of the Scioto, about twenty-six miles\r\nsouth of Piketon, where the ground was entirely settled, and the\r\ninnkeeper, where I lodged, was making his garden, sowing his\r\nsallad seed, and planting his peas. This journey was performed in\r\nthree days, and in travelling only one hundred and fifteen miles\r\nfrom north to south, this extraordinary difference of climate was\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nA traveller may leave Portsmouth when the farmer is beginning\r\nto hoe his corn the first time, and travel with good speed to\r\nDelaware, and find the husbandman just beginning to plant.\r\n\r\nInstances which have fallen within my own personal observation\r\nmight be multiplied to a great extent, but a few may suffice.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, there is a difference in the beginning and\r\nending of the warm season of about two weeks between Portsmouth\r\nand Delaware, or of three weeks between the former place and Lower\r\nSandusky.\r\n\r\nIn relation to the warmth of the climate, I will state two other\r\nfacts, originating, as I believe, in the prevalence of the southern\r\ncurrent of air from the Mexican Gulf along the Ohio river.\r\n\r\nFirst, In the summer months the paroquet ascends the Scioto more\r\nthan one hundred miles from its mouth, and until within a few\r\nyears past, wintered at Miller's Bottom, and at other places along\r\nthe banks of the Ohio, near its great southern bend in latitude\r\n38° north, in Gallia and Lawrence counties, in the state of Ohio.\r\nI have seen them there in all the winter months in considerable\r\nnumbers, but few however now winter there; and probably if the\r\ncold northwestern current of air from the great lakes becomes more\r\nand more prevalent in the winter months, these birds will migrate\r\naltogether to a more southern clime.\r\n\r\nAre these birds found as far to the north on the east side of\r\nthe Alleghany by at least three degrees? Monsieur Volney, Mr.\r\nJefferson, and others, say not. It has been denied that this fact\r\nproves any thing more than that this bird frequented these parts\r\nin quest of its favourite food. This food is grass and other\r\nvegetable matter in summer, and the cockle bur, and the balls of\r\nbutton-wood, or, as by a perversion of language, it is called in\r\nthis country sycamore.[42] But this bird may find its favourite\r\nfood as well east as west of the Alleghanies. The grasses and trees\r\nalluded to, flourish as I have observed in forty-five degrees of\r\nnorth latitude, and I am credibly informed that they are abundant\r\nas far north as Quebec, and even around Hudson's Bay. Wherever\r\nwaters run and trees grow on their banks, (if low and wet,) on\r\nthe American continent, even as high as eighty degrees of north\r\nlatitude, there the paroquet may find its food in abundance.\r\n\r\nAnother fact tending to establish the same point is, that the\r\nreed cane, before this country was much settled, grew in a higher\r\nlatitude by several degrees on this than it did on the other side\r\nof the Alleghany mountains. It has indeed been said, that this\r\ncane was never found north of the Ohio, nor above the mouth of\r\nthe Big Sandy River, which empties into the Ohio, on the line\r\nwhich separates Virginia and Kentucky. This however is incorrect;\r\nfor within a few years it was growing in abundance at Miller's\r\nBottom, twenty-six miles above the mouth of Big Sandy. It grew at\r\nLancaster, on the Hockhocking, northward of the mouth of the Big\r\nSandy, in a direct line, at least one hundred and fifty miles, and\r\nit now grows on the Whetstone branch of the Scioto, more than two\r\ndegrees of latitude above the lowest bend of the Ohio, which is at\r\nthe mouth of the Big Sandy. Before the white people settled there,\r\nI have every reason to believe, that the cane grew in great plenty\r\nat Delaware, where there are more signs of buffaloes than at any\r\nother place within my knowledge. It has been conjectured, that the\r\nseed of the cane was brought down and scattered by the Big Sandy;\r\nbut granting this, in what way could that stream carry this seed\r\nup the Hockhocking and Scioto to their sources? to places several\r\nhundred feet above the highest freshes ever known in this country?\r\nWith a knowledge of these facts, cast your eye at the map of Ohio.\r\nProofs within my reach might be multiplied to a much greater\r\nextent, but they are probably unnecessary.\r\n\r\nBut another current of air prevails here, especially in the cold\r\nmonths, coming from the mouth of the Missouri, which is a little\r\nto the south of west of this place. This current is colder than\r\nthe preceding one, and though moist, yet not as much so as the one\r\nalready described. It prevails generally in October and November,\r\nbefore our warm weather is over, and produces frosts and a chilly\r\ndampness, and what I have observed nowhere else, especially on the\r\neast side of the Alleghanies, it produces a kind of faintness at\r\nthe breast.\r\n\r\nPeople of delicate habits, coming here from the northern and\r\neastern states, uniformly complain of this faintness. It is not\r\nperhaps extraordinary that this current of air should be cold,\r\nproceeding as it does from a high northern latitude, along the\r\ngreat chain of rocky mountains in the northwest; that it should be\r\nmoist, and perhaps also that it should affect the animal economy\r\nunpleasantly, may possibly be attributed to its passing such a\r\nlength of way over the waters of the Missouri, and the wet prairies\r\nand barrens lying so extensively between us and the head waters of\r\nthat stream. The luxuriant vegetation which covers these prairies\r\nand barrens at that season of the year, begins to putrefy, and\r\nfills with unhealthy exhalations every gale of wind which passes\r\nover them.\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of this river (Missouri,) which is in about latitude\r\n38° north, this current of air is extremely cold in the winter\r\nmonths. It diverges from this point, and produces extreme cold\r\nat a considerable distance to the south of it on the Mississippi\r\nriver. General Rector, the present surveyor general of the United\r\nStates, who keeps his office at St. Louis, informs, that he has\r\nknown the Mississippi at St. Genevieve, in latitude about 37°,\r\nso firmly covered with ice in one night, as to be able to bear\r\nhorses and cattle the ensuing day. This circumstance must have been\r\nowing to the sudden change of the current of air from south to the\r\nnorthwest, descending the Missouri river from the cold regions at\r\nits sources.\r\n\r\nFrom several gentlemen, residents for many years in Illinois and\r\nMissouri Territories, I have been informed, that changes of weather\r\nin that region of country are, especially in winter, very frequent\r\nand great; that one day the moist south wind from the Mexican gulf\r\nwill prevail, and produce quite warm and mild weather for the\r\nseason; on the very next, or frequently in the latter part of the\r\nsame, the current of air from the sources of the Missouri will\r\nprevail, and block up the streams with ice.\r\n\r\nThere is a third current of air which prevails during our winter\r\nmonths, more and more, annually, as the country becomes cleared of\r\nits forests in the direction alluded to; it proceeds from the great\r\nlakes to the northwest of us, and even beyond them. Proceeding as\r\nit does from the north and northwest of lake Superior, and crossing\r\nthe great expanse of water in this direction, it rushes down these\r\ngreat lakes to the south end of lake Michigan in latitude about\r\n41° north, diverges from that point, and spreads over the immense\r\nregions lying to the south, where the air is more rarefied by\r\nreason of its warmer climate. This current of air brings along with\r\nit intense cold, and extended last winter even to New-Orleans,\r\nwhere the snow fell to such a depth, that sleighs were seen passing\r\nin every part of the city. The more the forests are cleared away\r\nbetween any place in this country and the northern lakes, the more\r\nthis cold current of air will prevail. This current also diverges\r\nfrom the southern shore of Lake Erie, but is not so strong as\r\nthat part of it which diverges from the south end of Michigan,\r\nand of course does not extend as far to the south. When this part\r\nof this state was first settled, this current of air was hardly\r\nfelt at this place, and then only for a short time in the winter\r\nmonths, and hardly ever reached the Ohio river; but last winter it\r\ncontinued three weeks at one time, and produced good sleighing;\r\nand also caused rheumatisms, pleurisies, peripneumonies, &c. which\r\nproved mortal to some. In this place, which is in latitude about\r\n39° 20′ north, the thermometer of Fahrenheit, hanging in an entry\r\nof a dwelling-house with closed doors, sunk to 24 degrees below\r\nzero. This extreme cold may be attributed to general, rather than\r\nto local causes, and it may be said that the winters all over the\r\nworld have been colder of late years than formerly. But on the very\r\nday, when it was thus cold, (if newspapers can be believed) a great\r\nnumber of vessels put to sea from Reedy Island in the Delaware\r\nbelow Philadelphia, and about thirty sail of vessels went to sea\r\nfrom New-York harbour.\r\n\r\nAll our streams were at the same time bridged with ice of great\r\nfirmness as well as thickness, and continued to be so for a\r\nconsiderable time afterward, until the warmer current of air from\r\nthe south prevailed over the current from the lakes. It will be\r\nproper, and may be necessary, here to state, that the latitudes of\r\nseveral places in this country are very different from what you\r\nwould be led to believe from examining any map or chart now or ever\r\nin existence. For instance, Lake Michigan extends farther south\r\nthan Fort Wayne, which place by actual survey is in this state; St.\r\nLouis is not 38°, and the most southern point or bend of the Ohio\r\nriver, is not more than latitude 38° north. I state merely what I\r\nam informed of by those who have ascertained these facts by actual\r\nobservation and survey. The place opposite the mouth of the Big\r\nSandy, is nearly as for south as Lexington in Kentucky. The south\r\nend of Michigan lake ought to be laid down on the map 41° north.\r\nPrevailing currents of air (not every breath of air which moves\r\nover the surface) I have attempted to describe. It may be well\r\nenough, however, to mention some other currents which sometimes\r\nprevail for a few days. And here I will mention what our oldest\r\nsettlers along the Ohio have observed, that is, that whenever in\r\na dry time, there is a current of air proceeding down the river\r\nfor three or four days in succession, the current from the Gulf of\r\nMexico is sure to drive it back with redoubled force, and after\r\nblowing a day or two, it is equally sure to bring rain with it. It\r\nis easy to assign a cause for it; for meeting the trade winds in\r\nthe Gulf, it is driven back with redoubled violence to the sources\r\nof the larger streams which empty themselves into the Gulf.\r\n\r\nWhen a thunder storm, proceeding in either a western or eastern\r\ndirection, as the case may be, happens to strike a large\r\nwater-course running either north or south, and when also there\r\nhappens to be a large branch emptying into the stream, within a few\r\nmiles either above or below the point where the storm approaches\r\nit, I have uniformly observed the storm to cross the large stream\r\nat the point where the large branch unites with it, and ascend the\r\nbranch. Where there are two large tributaries about equi-distant\r\nfrom the point of approach, the storm frequently divides and\r\nfollows each of them. The reason why it should be so, this is not\r\nthe place to discuss; but the Wisdom and Goodness which so ordered\r\nit, are too apparent to every rational mind to be overlooked. It\r\nmay be asked if the difference in latitude and elevation between\r\nthe Ohio and lake regions of country, does not produce a great\r\ndifference in the climates of those respective regions? These\r\ncauses certainly produce some difference, but not all. It is my\r\nobject to establish facts, rather than any favourite theory. The\r\ndifference of latitude between the Ohio river at the mouth of the\r\nScioto, and lake Erie at the mouth of the Maume or Sandusky, is\r\nnearly three degrees, and the difference of elevation above the\r\nsea is trifling, if any. From the mouth of the Scioto to Columbus,\r\nabout 90 miles in a direct line, the water, where there is what is\r\ncommonly called a _ripple_, runs briskly, and these ripples happen,\r\nperhaps, one to a mile; but they are in a sandstone region, and the\r\nfall of course is trifling.\r\n\r\nLet us suppose then, that the river Scioto descends one hundred\r\nfeet from the mouth of the Whetstone, which empties into that river\r\nat Columbus, to the Ohio, and that the Whetstone which runs through\r\na limestone formation, descends another hundred feet, which would\r\nmake Upper Sandusky two hundred feet higher than the Ohio river.\r\nFrom this highest ground between the Ohio and the lake, it is a\r\nwell-known fact, that the land descends towards the north much\r\nmore in a given distance, than it does towards the south, and the\r\ndistance is not half as far. The Maume and other streams putting\r\ninto the lake, are full of rapids. Admitting for argument's sake,\r\nthat the Sandusky or Maume descend only 100 feet, then the surface\r\nof the lake is 100 feet higher than the Ohio river. Would three\r\ndegrees of latitude, and 100 feet greater elevation produce three\r\nweeks difference in the seasons? Is there that difference between\r\nBaltimore in Maryland, and Wilkesbarre in Pennsylvania? Is there\r\nthat difference between New-York and Fort Edward on the Hudson? It\r\nis believed that there is not one half that difference.\r\n\r\nI have referred but little to thermometers, because they are kept\r\nin so many different situations by their owners, that I have known\r\nno less than 8 degrees of difference between several of them kept\r\nin one town, within almost a stone's throw of each other, at one\r\nand the same moment of time.\r\n\r\nEvery allowance being made for other causes, I am still of the\r\nopinion that the difference in the climates of the Ohio and lake\r\nregions of country, is to be attributed chiefly to the prevalence\r\nof different currents of air. The southern current rarely, if ever,\r\nreaches the northern lakes, and the northern, until lately, never\r\nreached the Gulf of Mexico. But as the country is cleared of its\r\nnative forests, we may reasonably conclude this cold current of\r\nair will prevail more and more, until we shall have snow enough\r\nfor sleighs, at least two months in every winter; the summers will\r\nbe shorter, the extremes of heat and cold will be greater than at\r\npresent, and those clouds which formerly obscured the sun almost\r\ncontinually during the summer months, will be chased away, and\r\nwith them the pale cheek, the sallow hue, the oppression at the\r\nbreast, and the difficulty of respiration, the headache, and the\r\nthousand ills which many of the first emigrants have experienced in\r\nour climate. We shall probably then have fewer diseases, and more\r\nacute ones. The storms will probably be fewer, more severe, and not\r\ncontinue as long as at present. There are still further views which\r\nmight be taken of this subject, but they are left to abler pens and\r\nfuture observations.\r\n\r\nThus I have endeavoured to give my opinion on a subject of some\r\ninterest to the present, as well as future generations; in doing\r\nwhich, I have not sought for flowers which might have been gathered\r\nby stepping out of my path, but the _fruit_ rather of my own\r\nobservation and experience: I have not wandered through the fields\r\nof imagination, invoking the poetic muse, but addressed myself\r\nchiefly\r\n\r\n      \"To him who soars on golden wing,\r\n      Guiding his fiery-wheeled throne,\r\n      The cherub contemplation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XIII. _On a singular Disruption of the Ground, apparently\r\nby Frost, in Letters from_ EDWARD HITCHCOCK, A.M. _Principal of\r\nDeerfield Academy_.\r\n\r\n(With a Plate.)\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To the Editor of the American Journal of Science, &c._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\nI have lately examined a singular disruption in the earth,\r\ndiscovered a few days since in the northerly part of an extensive\r\nmeadow in this town, about ten rods from Deerfield river.\r\n\r\nThe soil on the spot is alluvial, consisting of a dry, rich,\r\nvegetable mould, with a large intermixture of sand; and the field,\r\nelevated 14 feet above the bed of the river, is annually mowed. A\r\nvalley encircles the ruptured spot on the east, south, and west,\r\nonly five feet lower, yet so marshy and soft, as to render draining\r\nnecessary to make it passable; and immediately back of this valley,\r\non the south, rises a hill 100 feet high, at whose foot are several\r\nsprings. North of the rupture, also, between it and the river, is a\r\ngradual descent of three feet: indeed, the ground slopes from it on\r\nevery side except the northwest.\r\n\r\nA fissure one inch wide and fourteen deep, forming an almost\r\nperfect ellipsis, whose diameters are 9 and 5½ rods, marks the\r\nexterior limit of the convulsion. Within this curve are several\r\nothers nearly concentric to it, some forming a quarter, and some\r\nhalf an ellipsis, and near the longer axis are others, running in\r\nvarious directions. On this transverse diameter, which lies near\r\nthe highest part of the swell above described, and in its longest\r\ndirection, or parallel to the river, the greatest effect of the\r\nconvulsion appears. The earth, to the depth it has frozen the past\r\nwinter, 14 inches, is broken on a straight line above 6 rods, and\r\nthe south edge of the fissure, having been forced up, overlaps\r\nthe other, three feet. Where one edge does not thus overreach,\r\nthe tables of earth, which at a small distance resemble masses of\r\nice, are raised up so that their faces form an isosceles triangle,\r\nleaving a cavity beneath. About the extremities of the transverse\r\naxis, is also an overlapping of two feet, which continues nearly\r\ntwo rods on the curve each way from the axis, and in most places\r\nis double, overreaching internally and externally, exhibiting\r\nlikewise, some irregularity where the compressing forces acted at\r\nright angles to each other. The edges of these elevated masses\r\nof earth, which are yet frozen, are quite smooth, and the angles\r\nbut little fractured. I have dug into the earth about four feet\r\nunderneath the longer axis of the ellipsis, and thrust down a bar\r\nin other places, but cannot perceive that the soil has been moved\r\nbelow where it was frozen. It is, however, not the most favourable\r\nseason for ascertaining this fact.\r\n\r\nEvery appearance on the spot will justify this conclusion, that the\r\nfrozen surface of the earth around, has pressed with great force\r\n_from every direction_ to this ellipsis as a centre; for, were\r\nevery fissure in the ellipsis to be filled by replacing the earth,\r\nthere must remain on its longer axis and at the extremities of\r\nthis, an overplus of surface two feet wide.\r\n\r\nThe month of February last has been unusually cold. Its mean\r\ntemperature in Deerfield, by Fahrenheit's scales, is as follows.\r\n\r\n  7_h._ A. M.     1½_h._ P. M.     10_h._ P. M.\r\n      6°                24°                11°\r\n\r\nThe extremes were 25° below, and 49° above zero. On the last day\r\nbut one of the month, the cold suddenly relaxed; and on the 1st\r\nand 2d of March, a heavy and warm rain succeeded. This produced\r\nan uncommon rise in Deerfield river, and on the 3d of March, it\r\nhad overflowed the ground where the above described phenomenon\r\noccurred, and did not recede from it for 24 hours. Its greatest\r\ndepth there, was five feet. The snow was nearly one foot deep\r\nwhen the flood happened, and being a nonconductor of heat, the\r\ntemperature of the surface of the ground was not probably much\r\nchanged from its state in February, until the water came in contact\r\nwith it. It may not be amiss to give the state of the thermometer\r\non the last of February and beginning of March.\r\n\r\n              7_h._ A. M.  1½_h._ P. M.  10_h._ P. M.

About one o'clock on the morning of March 4th, Mr. Seth\r\nSheldon and family, living one mile south from this spot, and being\r\nawake, were alarmed by a loud report from the north, by which their\r\nhouse and furniture were much shaken. They compared the sound,\r\nthough louder by far than they had ever heard from this cause, to\r\nthat of a cracking in the earth by frost in severe weather. Some\r\nothers living rather nearer the spot, were awakened by the same\r\nreport. That the rupture in the earth was made at that time is\r\nprobable, though not certain.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to state, that during the flood, no ice, except\r\na few loose masses, was carried over, or near the spot where the\r\ndisruption appears. This, therefore, could not have produced it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Disruption of the Ground by Frost.\r\n\r\n_N. & S. S. Jocelyn Sc. N.H._]\r\n\r\nFig. 1. is a transverse section, taken with a theodolite, from\r\nDeerfield river 28 rods south, crossing the longer axis of the\r\ndisruption at right angles. The scale is 4 rods to an inch,\r\nalthough in laying off the heights and levels, the exact proportion\r\nwas a little varied, to render the irregularities of surface more\r\ndistinct. The letters of reference correspond to those on fig. 2,\r\nand need no explanation.\r\n\r\nFig. 2. is a bird's-eye view of the disruption and the adjoining\r\nregion, very obligingly sketched by Mr. Derick Barnard of Troy,\r\nNew-York. The surrounding country is somewhat contracted to bring\r\nmore of it into view.\r\n\r\nThese are all the facts I am able at present to collect concerning\r\nthis phenomenon. I have been particular as to the temperature\r\nof the air, and the situation of the adjacent country, from an\r\nidea that frost was a principal agent in producing it; and that,\r\ntherefore, these circumstances would be important in fixing a\r\ntheory. I will not, however, hazard any hypothesis on the subject;\r\nbut if you deem the fact of sufficient importance, your opinion,\r\nSir, is respectfully solicited.\r\n\r\n  Your humble Servant,\r\n\r\n  EDWARD HITCHCOCK.\r\n\r\n  _Deerfield, Mass. March 26th, 1818._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  _Deerfield, June 3d, 1818._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\nSince I sent you a description of a singular disruption in the\r\nearth in this town, another has been observed in the same meadows,\r\nabout one mile from the former. This is less than the one of which\r\nI sent you an account, but its situation is almost exactly similar;\r\nit being on a small elevation, on the sides of which, at a few rods\r\ndistant, is low wet ground. Indeed, the _general_ description which\r\nI sent you will answer for this smaller disruption. The diameters\r\nof this last, are only 7 and 8 paces, and the curve is not perfect.\r\nThere appears to have been an expansion of the earth's surface\r\naround both these spots, or disruptions, by which it was forced to\r\ngive way at the point where there was the least resistance, which,\r\nof course, would be on the highest ground. The more I observe of\r\nthis phenomenon, the more I am inclined to impute it to the agency\r\nof frost.\r\n\r\nIt may be proper to observe, that in neither of these disruptions\r\nhas the general mass of the hills sunk in the least. Had this\r\nbeen the case, it might perhaps have accounted for them. It is\r\nalso certain, that the soil below where it was frozen the past\r\nwinter, has not been moved. I mentioned this fact in my first\r\ncommunication, though with some suggested doubt.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nAn opinion having been requested by Mr. Hitchcock on the above\r\nfacts, it may be observed, that there appears in the statement\r\nsufficient evidence that the phenomenon (as the author has\r\nsuggested) is attributable to frost.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact, established equally by common experience and by\r\nnumerous experiments, that water, in freezing, expands. It is\r\ngenerally estimated that 8 cubic inches of water, become 9 by the\r\nact of congealing. The expansion is attributed, with sufficient\r\nevidence, to a crystalline arrangement arising from a kind of\r\npolarity in the particles of water exerted when they are near\r\ncongealing, by which they attract one another in certain points,\r\nand not in others. Dr. Black, with his usual felicity, has\r\nillustrated this tendency, by supposing a great number of small\r\nmagnetized needles, thrust through corks, so that they will float\r\nparallel to the surface of water, to be thrown promiscuously into\r\na vessel of that fluid. They will not remain in the situation in\r\nwhich they are thrown in, but, in consequence of their polarity,\r\nattractions and repulsions will be immediately exerted; they will\r\nrush together, with a force equal to the overcoming of a certain\r\nresistance; they will arrange themselves in pairs and groups, and\r\nfinally, in a connected assemblage.\r\n\r\nThe particles of water attract each other with a prodigious force,\r\nwhen resistance is opposed; for it is well known that domestic\r\nutensils, trees, rocks, and even cannon, and bomb-shells, are burst\r\nwith explosion, when water confined within them is frozen.\r\n\r\nThere is force enough then exerted by the expansion of freezing\r\nwater, to produce all the mechanical violence, whose effects were\r\nso striking in the instance at Deerfield.\r\n\r\nIn the common cracking of the ground by frost, so extensively\r\nobserved in cold climates, the effect appears to result in the\r\nfollowing manner. The water contained in the ground, (that is, in\r\nthat part which is within the reach of a freezing temperature)\r\nby congealing, expands and demands more space; a movement must\r\nnecessarily take place in the direction where there is the least\r\nresistance; this will evidently be upward, because the atmosphere,\r\nthe only counteracting power in this direction, cannot resist\r\nthe expansion of the freezing water as much as it is resisted by\r\nthe earth below the freezing stratum. Consequently, the freezing\r\nearth is forced upward, but being of unequal strength in different\r\nplaces, it cracks at the weakest spot; and the earth, for some\r\ndistance on the sides of the fissure, is thrown into the position\r\nof two planes gently inclined, their relative position resembling\r\nthat of a very flat roof, and the more they are lifted by frost,\r\nthe more they will decline from one another, and the wider will be\r\nthe fissure.\r\n\r\nBut why, in the instance which Mr. Hitchcock has related, did they\r\noverlap? The explanation appears to result from the circumstances\r\nof the case, as far as they can be understood without ocular\r\ninspection of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe elevated spot which cracked in so remarkable a manner, being\r\nnearly surrounded by a _belt_ of low wet ground, the congelation\r\nof the water in this ground by the intense cold, would of course\r\nproduce a very great expansive effort towards the elevated ground.\r\nThis, not only on account of its elevation, but from its containing\r\nless water, would not be able to exert an equal counteracting\r\neffort. The surface of the ground, therefore, (without at all\r\ndisturbing the unfrozen earth below,) was, by the expansive\r\neffort of the freezing water, _pushed along_ towards the elevated\r\nspot. This spot being possessed of a certain power of resistance\r\nderived from its gravity, and from the freezing of the water in\r\nit, would not immediately give way; but the whole surface, it is\r\nprobable, gradually rose for some time, while the expansion was\r\ngoing on and increasing. A cavity would thus be produced between\r\nthat superficial layer of frozen ground which was rising, and the\r\nunfrozen ground below. This cavity would of course be filled with\r\nair derived from the atmosphere, and from the porousness of the\r\nground below. When the place came to be overflowed, water would\r\nimmediately rush in through any fissure, and this hydraulic and\r\nhydrostatic effort would force the air out at any orifice, and\r\nthus blow the water up with it. This was probably the cause of the\r\nagitation of the water, and of the bubbling of air, and of the\r\nthrowing up of the water at intervals, observed by the boys on the\r\n3d of March.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the water covering the ground, would be to weaken its\r\ncohesion derived from frost, and as there were probably hundreds of\r\ntons of pressure, the vaulted ground, when sufficiently weakened,\r\ngave way with a loud explosion and a violent concussion, as heard\r\nby Mr. Sheldon's family, a few hours after the facts observed\r\nby the boys. The parts of the arch now fallen in, (so to speak)\r\nnecessarily either overlapped, or rose in ridges, piece being\r\npressed against piece, as described and figured by Mr. Hitchcock.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to this gentleman for his delineation of this\r\nsingular case.\r\n\r\nThe freezing of water, and its attendant expansion, are productive\r\nof multiplied and very diversified phenomena upon our globe,\r\nwhether we contemplate them in the delicate spiculæ of hoarfrost,\r\nthe six-rayed stars of snow, or in the stupendous glaciers of the\r\nAlps, and the awful icebergs of Greenland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Cambridge, January 25, 1819._\r\n\r\n  PROFESSOR SILLIMAN.\r\n\r\n  _Dear Sir_,\r\n\r\nIf the following observations are worthy of a place in your\r\nvaluable Journal, please to insert them, and oblige yours, with\r\nreal esteem,\r\n\r\n  J.

D. _Chemical Assistant in Harvard University, and Lecturer on\r\nChemistry and Pharmacy in Dartmouth College_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Electrical Battery in its common form is an unmanageable and\r\ninconvenient apparatus. When the coated surface is comparatively\r\nsmall, the instrument occupies a large space, and it cannot be\r\nreadily removed from place to place without much trouble and risk;\r\nthe apparatus is, moreover, very expensive, and when one of the\r\njars is broken, another of the same dimensions cannot readily be\r\nfound to supply its place.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me, that a Battery might be constructed of plates\r\nof glass and sheets of tinfoil, in which the same extent of coated\r\nsurface should occupy a much smaller space, and consequently\r\nthat the apparatus would be more convenient and more portable. I\r\nselected several panes of glass, the surfaces of which coincided\r\nclosely with each other, and then arranged them with sheets of\r\ntinfoil in this order, viz. pane of glass, sheet of tinfoil, then\r\nanother pane of glass, then a second sheet of tinfoil, and so on;\r\nthe sheets of foil being smaller than the plates of glass by two\r\ninches all around; the glass being 10 by 12, and the foil 6 by 8.\r\nThis apparatus contained six plates of tinfoil, and the lowest\r\nplate being numbered _one_, was connected with the ground, and by\r\nslips of tinfoil passing over the edges, with the _third_ plate,\r\nand this, in like manner with the _fifth_. The _second_ plate was\r\nconnected with the _fourth_, and this with the _sixth_, which\r\ncommunicated with the conductor of the machine; in this manner each\r\nplate positively electrified will be opposed by one negatively\r\nelectrified, and vice versa; the 6th, 4th, and 2d plates positive,\r\nand the 5th, 3d, and 1st, negative. Into this apparatus I could\r\nintroduce a powerful charge, but not possessing a battery of the\r\ncommon form, could not make comparative experiments. The annexed\r\nfigures will explain the construction of this apparatus.\r\n\r\n(See Plate.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: D^r. J. F. Dana's Electrical Battery.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1.\r\n\r\n  _a_ 1, _a_ 2, &c. the tinfoil.\r\n\r\n  _b b b_, plates of glass.\r\n\r\n  _c_, the intermediate slips connecting the plates 6, 4, and 2.\r\n\r\n  _d_, the slips connecting 5, 3, 1, and the ground.\r\n\r\nFig. 2.\r\n\r\n  _a_, the intermediate slips passing over the edges of the glass\r\n  and connecting plates, 1, 3, and 5.\r\n\r\n  _b_, the slip which connects the upper sheet of foil with the\r\n  4th, &c.\r\n\r\nIn a battery of the ordinary form, it is evident that a much less\r\nsurface is coated than in one of the above construction; in a\r\nbattery of the common form, two feet long, one foot wide, and ten\r\ninches high, and containing 18 coated jars, there will be no more\r\nthan 3500 square inches of coated surface, while in a battery of\r\nthe same dimensions on the proposed construction, there will be no\r\nless than 8000 square inches covered with tinfoil, allowing the\r\nsheet of glass and of foil to be ¼ inch thick.\r\n\r\nWhen plate glass is employed for making this battery, the ring of\r\nglass exterior to the tinfoil may be covered with varnish, and then\r\nthe next plate laid over it; the tinfoil will then be shut out for\r\never from the access of moisture, and the insulation will remain\r\nperfect. This form of the Electrical Battery is very portable, may\r\nbe packed in a case with the machine, and indeed a powerful battery\r\noccupies no greater space than a quarto volume. It is cheap and\r\neasily constructed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XV. _Chemical Examination of the Berries of the Myrica\r\nCerifera, or Wax Myrtle, by_ J. F. DANA, M. D. _Chemical Assistant\r\nin Harvard University, and Lecturer on Chemistry and Pharmacy in\r\nDartmouth College_.\r\n\r\n(Communicated for this Journal.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe myrtle wax of commerce has been examined by Dr. Bostock and\r\nby M. Cadet; the entire berry not having been made the subject\r\nof analysis, I have been induced to examine it, with a view to\r\nascertain the proportion of wax.\r\n\r\nI. Fifty grains of the most perfect berries were digested in\r\nrepeated portions of warm alcohol, until the fluid appeared to\r\nexert no further action. The first portions of alcohol were tinged\r\nof a green colour, but the last portions remained colourless.\r\n\r\nII. The alcoholic solutions were poured into a small retort of\r\nknown weight; the alcohol was carefully distilled off, and the\r\nresiduum dried; deducting the weight of the retort, there remained\r\n18.5 grs. for the weight of the matter dissolved by the alcohol.\r\n\r\nIII. The substances which had been dissolved by the alcohol\r\nconsisted of two portions, viz. the wax, which was of an\r\napple-green colour, and a reddish brown substance; this substance\r\nwas supposed to be resinous, and the contents of the retort were\r\ntherefore digested in acetic acid; the acid soon became of a\r\nreddish brown colour, and dissolved nearly the whole of the matter\r\nin the retort, leaving the wax. The acid solution, together with a\r\nsmall portion of insoluble reddish matter, were carefully separated\r\nfrom the wax. The wax being dried and melted, weighed 16 grains.\r\n\r\nIV. The acetic acid solution was evaporated to dryness, and a dark\r\nbrown matter was obtained; it was almost totally soluble in warm\r\nalcohol, from which it was precipitated by water; it was supposed\r\ntherefore to consist chiefly of resin, with a small portion of\r\nextractive matter, and may be called resino-extractive; it weighed\r\n2.5 grains.\r\n\r\nV. The matter insoluble in alcohol consisted of two parts, viz.\r\nthe kernels and a fine-grained black powder, having very much the\r\nappearance of fine gunpowder; the powder was carefully separated\r\nfrom the kernels by a wire sieve, and weighed 7.5 grains. The\r\nkernels were found to weigh 23.75 grains.\r\n\r\nFrom this analysis it appears that the entire berries consist of\r\n\r\n  Wax                  32.00\r\n  Resino-extractive     5.00\r\n  Black powder         15.00\r\n  Kernels              47.00\r\n                      ------\r\n                       99.50\r\n  Loss                   .50\r\n                      ------\r\n                      100.00\r\n\r\nThe chemical properties of the wax and of the black powder may be\r\nmade the subject of another communication.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Earthy phosphate of iron_ has recently been found at Hopkinton,\r\nMass. It exists there in large quantities, and is employed as\r\na pigment. The gentleman on whose grounds it was found sent me\r\nseveral pounds of it.\r\n\r\n  J. F. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XVI. _Analysis of Wacke, by Dr._ J. W. WEBSTER, _of Boston_.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne hundred parts exposed to a red heat in a platina crucible lost\r\n18.5, acquired an umber brown colour, and a degree of hardness\r\nsufficient to scratch glass.\r\n\r\nOne hundred parts reduced to fine powder were mixed with four\r\ntimes the weight of soda, and exposed to heat, gradually increased\r\nfor three quarters of an hour; at the expiration of which time,\r\nthe whole had acquired a pasty consistence. The crucible was now\r\nremoved from the fire, its outer surface carefully wiped. Muriatic\r\nacid was poured on till all effervescence ceased. The solution\r\nobtained was evaporated to dryness, gradually assuming an orange\r\nred colour. Water was now poured upon the mass, after which it was\r\nfiltered, and the powder remaining carefully dried; after ignition,\r\nand while warm, it weighed 28 parts. This powder was insoluble in\r\nmuriatic acid, and of a white colour.\r\n\r\nTo the filtered solution, reduced by evaporation, carbonate of\r\npotash was added, the precipitate was collected on a filter, washed\r\nand dried; it weighed 23 parts. This powder was redissolved in\r\nsulphuric acid, sulphate of potash added, and crystals of alum\r\nfinally obtained; hence this powder was alumine. To the liquor from\r\nwhich the silex and alumine had thus been separated, acetic acid\r\nwas added; the whole evaporated to dryness; the excess of acid\r\nbeing removed, a small quantity of water was poured on, and after\r\nstrong ignition, the precipitate weighed 4.5.\r\n\r\nInto a very small tubulated retort I introduced a portion from the\r\nsame mass, whence the piece submitted to analysis was broken, and\r\nobtained over mercury the carbonic acid in the usual manner. This\r\nwas equal to 2.32; by deducting this from 18.5 the loss during\r\nexposure to red heat, we shall have 16.18, the proportion of water.\r\nThe oxide of iron was separated from the solutions after the\r\naddition of acetic acid, by ammonia, and weighed 26 parts.\r\n\r\n  Silex           28.\r\n  Alumine         23.\r\n  Lime             4.5\r\n  Carbonic acid    2.32\r\n  Water           16.18\r\n  Oxide of iron   26.\r\n                 ------\r\n                    100\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAGRICULTURE AND ECONOMICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XVII. _On the Comparative Quantity of Nutritious Matter which\r\nmay be obtained from an Acre of Land when cultivated with Potatoes\r\nor Wheat, by Dr._ ELI IVES, _Professor of Materia Medica and Botany\r\nin Yale College_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a good season an acre of suitable land well cultivated will\r\nproduce 400 bushels of potatoes. In Woodbridge, a town adjoining\r\nNew-Haven, a crop of 600 bushels of potatoes has been obtained from\r\na single acre. A bushel of potatoes weighs 56 pounds. Multiply 400,\r\nthe number of bushels, by 56, the weight of a single bushel, gives\r\n22400, the number of pounds of potatoes produced upon one acre.\r\n\r\nThirty bushels of wheat are considered a good crop as the product\r\nof one acre of land. About ⅚ of wheat may be considered as\r\nnutritious matter.\r\n\r\nAccording to the experiments of Dr. Pearson and Einhoff, about\r\none-third of the potato is nutritious matter. From the analysis\r\nof Einhoff, 7680 parts of potatoes afforded 1153 parts of\r\nstarch--fibrous matter analogous to starch 540 parts--albumen 107\r\nparts--mucilage 312 parts. The sum of these products amounts to\r\nabout one-third of the potatoes subject to the experiment.\r\n\r\nSir Humphry Davy observes, that one-fourth of the weight of\r\npotatoes at least may be considered nutritious matter.\r\n\r\nOne-fourth of 22400, the product of an acre of ground, cultivated\r\nwith potatoes, is 5600. The whole weight of a crop of wheat\r\ncalculated at 30 bushels to the acre, and at 60 pounds to the\r\nbushel, gives 1800. Deducting one-sixth from the wheat as matter\r\nnot nutritious, and the weight is reduced to 1500.\r\n\r\nThe nutritious matter of the crop of potatoes to that of wheat is\r\nas 5600 to 1500, or as 56 to 15.\r\n\r\nThe starch might be obtained by a very simple machine, recommended\r\nby Parmentier; and in seasons when potatoes are abundant, the\r\npotatoes might be converted to starch, and the starch preserved for\r\nany length of time, and used as a substitute for wheaten flour.\r\n\r\nThe machine alluded to is a cylinder of wood about three feet long\r\nand six inches in diameter, covered with sheet tin, punched outward\r\nso as to form a coarse grater, and turned by a crank. This cylinder\r\nis placed in a box of boards whose sides slope a little inward upon\r\nthe principle of a hopper, and a tub of water is placed beneath:\r\nThe potatoes are thrown into this box, and as the crank is turned\r\nthey are crushed, and the starch or fecula subsides to the bottom\r\nof the water. It is well known, that potatoes are largely used in\r\nEngland mixed with flour to form a very good bread; the _starch_ of\r\nthe potato would of course answer much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XVIII. _Biographical Notice of the late_ ARCHIBALD BRUCE, M.\r\nD. _Professor of Materia Medica, and Mineralogy in the Medical\r\nInstitution of the State of New-York, and Queen's College,\r\nNew-Jersey; and Member of various Learned Societies in America and\r\nEurope._ With a Portrait.\r\n\r\n(Communicated.)\r\n\r\n\r\nDoctor Archibald Bruce, (the subject of this Memoir) was a native\r\nof the city of New-York, in North America. He was born in the month\r\nof February, in the year seventeen hundred and seventy-seven. His\r\nfather was, at that time, at the head of the medical department of\r\nthe British army, (then stationed at New-York) to which he had been\r\nattached from his youth, having been many years previously resident\r\nat New-York, as surgeon to the artillery department; where he was\r\nmarried, in or about the year seventeen hundred and sixty-seven, to\r\nJudith, a daughter of Nicholas Bayard, formerly of the same city,\r\nat that time the widow of Jeremiah Van Rensselaer of Greenbush; by\r\nwhom he had another son, (who died an officer in the British army\r\nin Ireland) and a daughter, who died while a child.\r\n\r\nWilliam Bruce, (the father above-mentioned,) and his brother\r\nArchibald, together with a sister, were natives of the town of\r\nDumfries in Scotland, where their father was many years resident as\r\nthe parochial clergyman; and so continued until his decease, much\r\nrespected.\r\n\r\nBoth sons applied themselves to the science of medicine and\r\nsurgery. William, as above stated, became a physician in the\r\nBritish army, and died, in that station, of the yellow fever,\r\nin the island of Barbadoes. And Archibald received a commission\r\nof surgeon in the British navy, in which he continued until\r\ndisqualified by old age, when he retired from business, and died\r\na few years since in London. For many years he acted as surgeon\r\nto the several ships commanded by Sir Peter Parker, captain, and\r\nafterward admiral.\r\n\r\nDoctor William Bruce, before his final separation from his family,\r\non the occasion of his being ordered to the West-India station, had\r\nalways declared that his son Archibald should never be educated for\r\nthe medical profession; and finally enjoined such instruction upon\r\nhis wife and friends, to whom the charge of the boy was committed.\r\nAfter his decease, the same injunction was repeated by the uncle,\r\nthen in Europe, who was ever averse to his nephew's making choice\r\nof this profession: much pains were therefore early exerted to\r\ndivert him from such inclination.\r\n\r\nThe momentous state of political affairs, induced his mother to\r\nsend him to Halifax, under the care of William Almon, M. D. a\r\nparticular friend of her husband, with whom, however, remaining\r\nbut a short time, he returned to New-York; and was placed at a\r\nboarding-school at Flatbush, Long Island, under the direction of\r\nPeter Wilson, LL.D. who was in high standing as a teacher of the\r\nlanguages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARCHIBALD BRUCE M. D.]\r\n\r\nIn 1791, he was admitted a student of the arts in Columbia college.\r\nNicholas Romayne, M.D. was at this time among the physicians of\r\nhighest consideration in New-York, and was engaged in delivering\r\nlectures on different subjects of medical science in Columbia\r\nCollege. Having pursued the early part of his medical studies with\r\nDr. William Bruce, he felt a generous gratitude for the instruction\r\nand attention which he had received from him, and endeavoured to\r\nrequite them by advising with his son, and promoting his views,\r\nas far as lay in his power. Here commenced a friendship which\r\nincreased with advancing years, and terminated but with life. At\r\nthis period, young Bruce began to evince a desire to oppose the\r\ninclination of his father and friends by studying medicine; this\r\nstudy, without their knowledge, and while a student of the arts in\r\nthe senior class, he commenced by attending Dr. Romayne's lectures.\r\nSuch was the strong bent of his mind towards the study of medicine,\r\nand its collateral physical pursuits, that the persuasion and\r\nremonstrances of his friends proved alike ineffectual, and he soon\r\ngave free scope to the prevailing inclination.\r\n\r\nThe collection and examination of minerals, a pursuit not then at\r\nall attended to in this country, was his particular relief from\r\nother studies; for even during his recreation, he was ever on the\r\nlook-out for something new or instructing in mineralogy.\r\n\r\nDr. Romayne being about visiting Europe, young Bruce pursued his\r\nstudies with Samuel Bard, M.D.; and having attended the usual\r\ncourses in Columbia College, he left the United States for Europe\r\nin 1798, and in 1800 he obtained the degree of doctor in medicine\r\nfrom the University of Edinburgh, after defending a Thesis, De\r\nVariola Vaccina.\r\n\r\nHaving now finished his medical studies, he was prepared to visit\r\nthe continent of Europe with peculiar advantage; for his continued\r\nattachment to mineralogy, a liberal distribution of American\r\nspecimens then comparatively new in Europe, and his social habits\r\nand dispositions, which were very conciliating, secured him the\r\nbest introductions from Edinburgh, and laid the foundation of\r\npermanent friendships.\r\n\r\nDuring a tour of two years, he visited France, Switzerland, and\r\nItaly; and collected a mineralogical cabinet of great value and\r\nextent. After his return to England, he married in London, and\r\ncame out to New-York in the autumn of 1803, to enter on the active\r\nduties of a practitioner of medicine.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the year 1805, the practice of physic in the state of\r\nNew-York was regulated by no public authority, and of course was\r\nnot in the happiest condition to promote the respectability and\r\nusefulness of the profession. To remove, as far as possible, the\r\nexisting inconveniences, Dr. Bruce became an active agent, and\r\nin conjunction with Dr. Romayne and other medical gentlemen of\r\nNew-York, succeeded in establishing the state and county medical\r\nsocieties, under the sanction of the state legislature. This act\r\n\"may be considered among the first efforts made in this country to\r\nreduce medicine to a regular science, by investing the privileges\r\nof medical men in the body of the members of the profession.\"\r\n\r\nIn the organization of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of\r\nthe state of New-York, Dr. Bruce and Dr. Romayne were eminently\r\nactive, and by their united exertion and perseverance, (opposed by\r\nmuch professional talent) they obtained a charter from the regents.\r\nIn this new institution, as professor of the materia medica, and\r\nof his favourite pursuit, mineralogy, he exhibited the fruits of\r\narduous study, with a dignity of character, and urbanity of manner,\r\nwhich commanded the respect of the profession, and the regard of\r\nthe students.\r\n\r\nThe ruling passion in Dr. Bruce's mind, was a love of natural\r\nscience, and especially of mineralogy. Towards the study of this\r\nscience, he produced in his own country a strong impulse, and he\r\ngave it no small degree of eclat. His cabinet, composed of very\r\nselect and well characterized specimens; purchased by himself, or\r\ncollected in his own pedestrian and other tours in Europe, or, in\r\nmany instances, presented to him by distinguished mineralogists\r\nabroad; and both in its extent, and in relation to the then state\r\nof this country, very valuable, soon became an object of much\r\nattention. That of the late B. D. Perkins, which, at about the same\r\ntime, had been formed by Mr. Perkins in Europe, and imported by him\r\ninto this country, was also placed in New-York, and both cabinets\r\n(for both were freely shown to the curious, by their liberal and\r\ncourteous proprietors) contributed more than any causes had ever\r\ndone before, to excite in the public mind an active interest in the\r\nscience of mineralogy.[43]\r\n\r\nDr. Bruce, while abroad, had been personally and intimately\r\nconversant with the Hon. Mr. Greville, of Paddington Green, near\r\nLondon, a descendant of the noble house of Warwick, the possessor\r\nof one of the finest private cabinets in Europe, and a zealous\r\ncultivator of mineralogy. Count Bournon, one of those loyal French\r\nexiles, who found a home in England, during the storm of the French\r\nrevolution, was almost domesticated at Mr. Greville's, and was\r\nhardly second to any man in mineralogical, and particularly in\r\ncrystallographical knowledge. His connexions with men of science\r\non the continent, were of the first order, and to be familiar at\r\nMr. Greville's, and with Count Bournon, was to have access to\r\nevery thing connected with science in England and France. Dr.\r\nBruce was also at home at Sir Joseph Banks's, the common resort of\r\nlearned and illustrious men. Thus he enjoyed every advantage in\r\nEngland, and when he went to the continent, the abundant means of\r\nintroduction which he possessed, brought him into contact with the\r\ndistinguished men of Paris, and of other cities which he visited.\r\nThe learned and estimable Abbé Haüy was among his personal friends\r\nand correspondents; and many others might be mentioned in the same\r\ncharacter, whose names are among the first in the ranks of science,\r\nin various countries of Europe.\r\n\r\nReturned to his own country, after being so long familiar with the\r\nfine collections in natural history, and especially in mineralogy,\r\nin various countries in Europe, Dr. Bruce manifested a strong\r\ndesire to aid in bringing to light the neglected mineral treasures\r\nof the United States. He soon became a focus of information on\r\nthese subjects. Specimens were sent to him from many and distant\r\nparts of the country, both as donations and for his opinion\r\nrespecting their nature. In relation to mineralogy he conversed,\r\nhe corresponded extensively, both with Europe and America; he\r\nperformed mineralogical tours; he kindly sought out and encouraged\r\nthe young mineralogists of his own country, and often expressed a\r\nwish to see a journal of American mineralogy upon the plan of that\r\nof the School of Mines at Paris. This object, it is well known, he\r\naccomplished, and in 1810, published the first number of this work.\r\nOwing to extraneous causes, it was never carried beyond one volume;\r\nbut it demonstrated the possibility of sustaining such a work in\r\nthe United States, and will always be mentioned in the history\r\nof American science, as the earliest original purely scientific\r\njournal of America.\r\n\r\nDr. Bruce had, in a high degree, the feelings of a man of science.\r\nHe was ever forward to promote its interests, and both at home and\r\nabroad, was considered as one of its most distinguished American\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nMany strangers of distinction came introduced to him, and his\r\nurbanity and hospitality rarely left him without guests at his\r\nboard. During the latter part of his life, he seems to have been\r\nless interested in science. His journal had been so long suspended,\r\nthat it was considered as virtually relinquished; his health was\r\nundermined by repeated attacks of illness, and science and society\r\nhad to lament his sudden departure, when he had scarcely attained\r\nthe meridian of life.\r\n\r\nHe died in his native place on the 22d of February, 1818, of an\r\napoplexy, in the 41st year of his age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTELLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XIX. 1. _Dr._ J. W. WEBSTER'S _Lectures_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. J. W. Webster, some months since, commenced a course of\r\nLectures in the town of Boston, on Geology and Mineralogy. Having\r\nfinished his first course, he is now occupied with a second on the\r\nsame subjects, and we understand receives the patronage of some of\r\nthe most respectable citizens of Boston and its vicinity. He makes\r\nGeology the groundwork of his plan, and fills up by describing the\r\nmetals and minerals met with in each class of rocks, after the\r\nrock has been noticed. A pretty full account is given of the coal\r\nformations, (several of which Dr. W. has visited) and of the modes\r\nof searching and boring. A view is given of the formations of Paris\r\nand the Isle of Wight, with specimens from those districts.\r\n\r\nIn the volcanic part, a description (from personal observation) is\r\ngiven of St. Michael's. The structure of veins; the forming and\r\ndestroying effects of water; the physiognomy of the dry land and\r\nsubmarine; the origin of islands and coral reefs, and a view of the\r\nprincipal mountain ranges throughout the world conclude the course.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Dr. Webster's Cabinet._\r\n\r\nDr. Webster, having spent two or three years in Europe, in\r\nprofessional studies, during which time he devoted much attention\r\nto mineralogy and geology, with the ample aids afforded by the\r\ncabinets and distinguished teachers in Scotland, France, and\r\nEngland, has recently returned to his own country, and has brought\r\nwith him a very select and considerably extensive cabinet of\r\nminerals, with which, and with American specimens, he illustrates\r\nhis lectures. We understand that the collection contains some\r\nthousand specimens, and is good in the English and Scotch minerals;\r\nalso in the Siberian coppers; it contains a suite of three hundred\r\ngeological specimens from Freyberg, from granite to gravel. The\r\ngeological part is extensive, and was increased by numerous\r\npedestrian tours in England and Scotland; most of the geological\r\nspecimens have been examined, in company with Professor Jameson.\r\nThe volcanic part is good, from the extensive opportunities which\r\nDr. Webster enjoyed in the Azores, in which, on his return to this\r\ncountry, he spent some time, and found much to interest him. His\r\nobservations will soon be given to the public, in a work entitled\r\n_Remarks on the Azores or Western Islands_.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that they are volcanic, and of course afford\r\nthe usual volcanic substances. The most interesting part is that\r\noccupied by the boiling fountains, in many respects similar to the\r\nGeysers of Iceland, excepting that the water is not ejected to\r\nany considerable height; but the incrustations, the sinter, and\r\nsulphur, are every way equal to any specimens which Dr. Webster saw\r\nin Sir G. Mackenzie's collection.\r\n\r\nWe are much gratified in noticing both what Dr. Webster has done\r\nand is still doing. We are persuaded that he will do much towards\r\npromoting the cultivation of American mineralogy and geology, and\r\nespecially in the enlightened community in which he resides.\r\n\r\nWe cordially wish him success, and trust that it will be ensured by\r\nthe patronage of the citizens of Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Supposed identity of Copal and Amber._\r\n\r\nA correspondent, whose paper is withheld from publication till some\r\nadditional experiments can be made, conceives that copal and amber\r\nare originally the same substance, and the product of the same tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. THE NECRONITE.--(_A supposed new mineral._)\r\n\r\n_Extract of a letter from Dr. H. H. Hayden of Baltimore, to the\r\nEditor, dated January 5, 1819._\r\n\r\n\"It (the necronite) occurs in a primitive marble, or limestone,\r\nwhich is obtained 21 miles from Baltimore, and a small distance\r\nfrom the York and Lancaster road. It was first noticed by myself at\r\nWashington's monument, in which this marble is principally employed.\r\n\r\n\"It occurs, for the most part, in isolated masses in the blocks,\r\nor slabs, both in an amorphous and crystallized state. It is\r\nmost commonly associated with a beautiful brown mica, of the\r\ncolour of titanium; small but regular crystals of sulphuret of\r\niron, tremolite, and small prismatic crystals of titanium, which\r\nare rare. The form of the crystals is a rhomboid, approximating\r\nvery much to that of the felspar, and which has inclined some to\r\nconsider it as such. Also, the hexaedral prism, resembling that of\r\nthe beryl. This form is rare, and has not, as yet, I believe, been\r\nfound complete. Its colour is a bluish white, and clear white. Its\r\nstructure much resembles felspar, being lamellar; sometimes opaque,\r\nsemi-transparent and transparent, at least in moderately thin\r\npieces. It scratches glass, carbonat of lime, and even felspar, in\r\na _slight_ degree. In all our efforts, it has been found infusible,\r\nper se, or with borate of soda, and even from all the force of heat\r\nthat could be excited in a smith's furnace, it came out unchanged\r\nin any degree. The acids seem to have no sensible effect upon it,\r\neither cold or hot. This is all that I can say of it at present,\r\nexcept that it possesses a most _horrid_ smell.[44] I have since\r\nfound in a marble of the same kind, but from a different quarry,\r\nand a few miles distant from the first, a quartz almost as fetid\r\nas the necronite, and likewise associated with _small_ prisms of\r\ntitanium.\r\n\r\n\"These substances carry with them a degree of interest in another\r\npoint of view. They seem to invalidate the opinion that the fetid\r\nsmell of secondary limestone, slate, &c. is derived from the\r\ndecomposition of animal matter. As their gangue is _decidedly_ a\r\nrock of primitive formation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Another new mineral observed by Dr. Hayden._\r\n\r\n\"Exclusive of the interest which the necronite has excited with me\r\nand several others, I have besides stumbled upon another substance,\r\nif possible still more interesting. I discovered it in an imperfect\r\nstate, about 4 years since, but not until recently have I been able\r\nto find it perfect, in beautiful garnet coloured cubic crystals\r\n¼ of an inch square or nearly. These crystals are very liable or\r\nsubject to decomposition, in which state they present a perfect but\r\nspongy cube. Although they resemble the cubic zeolite, yet they\r\nhave nothing of its character with them besides.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remark._\r\n\r\nDr. Hayden without doubt alludes to the _chabasie_ of the Abbé\r\nHaüy, formerly but inaccurately called the cubic zeolite; for it is\r\nreally a rhomboid very nearly approaching a cube--its angles being\r\n93° 48′, and 86° 12′.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. PRESERVATION OF DEAD BODIES.\r\n\r\n_From Thenard's Chemistry_, vol. iii. _Paris ed. p._ 713.\r\n\r\nThe author declines describing the methods of embalming commonly\r\nemployed, and proceeds to describe the mode which was for the first\r\ntime employed by Dr. Chaussier.\r\n\r\n\"This process consists in placing the dead body thoroughly emptied\r\nand washed, in water kept constantly saturated with corrosive\r\nsublimate. This salt gradually combines with the flesh, gives it\r\nfirmness, renders it imputrescible, and incapable of being attacked\r\nby insects and worms.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen, (adds the author) a head thus prepared, which had\r\nbeen exposed alternately to the sun and rain during several years,\r\nwithout having suffered the slightest change. It was very little\r\ndeformed, and easily recognized, although the flesh had become as\r\nhard as wood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n6. MATCHES KINDLING WITHOUT FIRE.\r\n\r\n(_From Thenard's Chemistry, Vol._ ii. _p._ 525.)\r\n\r\nThis match is prepared by mingling two parts of the oxymuriate\r\nof potash and one of sulphur, which by means of a little gum is\r\nattached to a common sulphur match. This match on being dipped\r\ninto, or rather slightly wet with, strong sulphuric acid, (oil of\r\nvitriol) immediately catches fire.\r\n\r\nThe author has not added the caution that the sulphur and salt\r\nshould be pulverized separately; if rubbed together in a mortar,\r\nthey will explode with some danger to the operator, provided the\r\nquantity be over a few grains.\r\n\r\nMatches made upon this principle, have been for some time made and\r\nsold in this country. They are sometimes put up in little japanned\r\ncases with a small phial, from which when inverted with the mouth\r\nopen, nothing will drop, and yet the match kindles on being thrust\r\nin quite to the bottom. The truth is, these bottles contain a\r\nlittle amianthus moistened with sulphuric acid, which thus kindles\r\nthe match, but as the acid soon weakens by attracting water from\r\nthe air, it is better to use a phial of the acid in the liquid\r\nstate. A few drops answer the purpose, and when this is weakened,\r\nit is easily renewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _Cleaveland's Mineralogy._\r\n\r\nOur opinion of this work was fully expressed in the review of it in\r\nour first number. In the Edinburgh Review for September, 1818, this\r\nwork is again reviewed, and in a manner which must gratify every\r\nfriend to American science. It will be necessary to cite only a\r\nsingle sentence. After commending the condensed and _honest_ manner\r\nin which the work is printed, (for they say, that the same matter\r\nwhich here fills one volume would in England have been spread over\r\nthree,) the reviewer adds, \"We should be glad to see it reprinted\r\nexactly upon the plan of the original; and we have no doubt that\r\nit would be found _the most useful work on mineralogy in our\r\nlanguage_.\" More need not be--more scarcely could be said.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _A new Alkali._\r\n\r\nA new alkali has recently been discovered in Sweden, by M.\r\nArfwedson. It is found in the petalite, a mineral from Utoen, in\r\nSweden, in a proportion not over 5 pr. ct.; also in the triphane\r\nor spodumene, in the proportion of 8 per cent. and in what is\r\ncalled crystallized lepidolite, in the proportion of 4 per cent.\r\nIn its general properties it very nearly resembles the other\r\nalkalies. When heated in contact with platinum it acts on it. In\r\nthe galvanic circuit it was decomposed \"with bright scintillations,\r\nand the reduced metal being separated, afterward burnt.\" This metal\r\nresembles sodium. The new alkali has been called lithia. (_Jour. of\r\nScience of the Roy. Inst._)\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _Ignited Platinum Wire._\r\n\r\nIn our last we mentioned the lamp without flame, the ignition of\r\nplatinum wire being sustained by means of the vapour of alcohol.\r\n\r\nSir H. Davy has discovered that the vapour of camphor answers the\r\nsame purpose: \"If a piece of camphor, or a few small fragments in a\r\nheap, be placed in any convenient situation, as on a shilling, the\r\nbottom of a glass, &c. and a piece of platinum wire, either coiled\r\nor pressed up together, be heated and laid upon it, the platinum\r\nwill glow as long as any camphor remains, and will frequently light\r\nit up into a flame.\"\r\n\r\n  _Jour. Roy. Inst._\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _Red Rain._\r\n\r\nA red rain fell in Naples, (March 14, 1818,) the common people were\r\nmuch alarmed, and called it _blood_ or _fire_.\r\n\r\nAn earthy powder was collected, which when dry was yellow,\r\nunctuous, and of an earthy taste; its specific gravity 2.07.\r\n\r\nIts analysis presented silex 33--alumine 15.5--chrome 1.--\r\niron 14.5--carbonic acid 9., and a combustible substance of a\r\ncarbonaceous nature.\r\n\r\nIt is thought that this powder had not a volcanic origin, and that\r\nthe presence of chrome assimilates it with meteoric stones. _Ibid._\r\n\r\n\r\n11. _Gnephalium._\r\n\r\nProfessor Ives has discovered a new species of gnephalium with\r\ndecurrent leaves, of which a plate and description will appear in\r\nour next number.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. _Augite._\r\n\r\nM. Haüy has united the fassalite and the bakalite with the sahlite,\r\na sub-species of augite. (See Mem. of the Museum of Nat.

Gibbs, a collection\r\nof American minerals by states, according to the arrangement of\r\nthe minerals of the departments of France, in the cabinet of the\r\nschool of mines at Paris, was begun some time since, at the rooms\r\nof the Hist. Society in New-York; and recently in the University of\r\nCambridge. In the arrangement of the latter, he has been assisted\r\nby Dr. J. W. Webster, lecturer on mineralogy and geology in Boston.\r\n\r\n\r\n18. _C. S. Rafinesque, Esq._\r\n\r\nWe are requested to announce that a Journal of this gentleman's\r\n\"Travels and Discoveries in the West, will be published this\r\nyear by Cramer and Spear of Pittsburg, and that the results of\r\nhis zoological and botanical labours consist in the discovery of\r\nabout 15 new genera, and 180 new species of plants; about 75 new\r\ngenera, and 600 new species of animals, whereof nearly 70 are new\r\nfishes, 20 new quadrupeds, 30 new reptiles, 112 new shells, 250\r\nnew fossils, &c.\" \"He has inquired how the deep valleys have been\r\nexcavated, where lakes existed, where the old falls of the Ohio\r\nwere, the extent and origin of the coal region, &c.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n19. _Medical College of Ohio._\r\n\r\n_Extract of a letter from Cincinnati, Jan. 10th, 1819._\r\n\r\nThe legislature of the state of Ohio have just established a\r\nmedical college in this city, and have by an unanimous vote passed\r\na law incorporating the Faculty. In the act, Dr. Samuel Brown of\r\nAlabama is named as Professor of Anatomy, Dr. Daniel Drake of\r\nCincinnati, Professor of the Institutes and Practice of Medicine,\r\nDr. Coleman Rogers, Professor of Surgery, and Dr. Slack, Professor\r\nof Chemistry. The other Professors are to be appointed by the\r\nFaculty, and it is believed that Dr. Richardson of Lexington,\r\nKentucky, will be called to the Obstetrical chair. Very high\r\nexpectations are entertained of the importance of this institution\r\nin the west.\r\n\r\n\r\n20. _Notes on Ohio._\r\n\r\nCaleb Atwater, Esq. of Circleville, Ohio, has issued proposals for\r\npublishing the above work, (mentioned in our last number) with\r\na prospectus exhibiting its principal features. We doubt not it\r\nwill contain valuable information concerning a very interesting\r\nportion of the United States, and every effort on the part of\r\nmen of intelligence and enlarged views, to make the western and\r\nsouthwestern states better known, deserves, and it is believed will\r\nreceive, adequate support.\r\n\r\n\r\n21. _Discovery of American Tungsten and Tellurium._\r\n\r\nNeither of these metals, so far as we are informed, has been\r\nannounced as existing in either of the Americas. It is well known\r\nto mineralogists, that tungsten is very rare, and that tellurium is\r\nfound only in Transylvania.\r\n\r\nWe have now the pleasure to state that both these metals exist\r\nin the Bismuth mine, in the town of Huntington, parish of New\r\nStratford, in Connecticut, 20 miles west of New-Haven.\r\n\r\nDuring the examination of some ores, brought to us by Mr. Ephraim\r\nLane, the proprietor of this mine, we obtained the tungsten in the\r\nstate of yellow oxid, and the tellurium in the metallic state.\r\n\r\nThe tungsten is stated to be abundant in the mine; it is the\r\nferruginous species, known to mineralogists by the name of wolfram.\r\n\r\nWe cannot yet say whether the tellurium is abundant, having\r\nobtained it from only two pieces; from these we extracted also\r\ntungsten, so that it may possibly constitute a new mineral species.\r\nFurther particulars will be given in our next Number.\r\n\r\n\r\n22. _Mr. Sheldon's Application of Chesnut Wood to the Arts of\r\nTanning and Dying._\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\nA considerable time since, we were confidentially made acquainted\r\nwith the discovery detailed in the following letter. We have\r\nrepeated the most important of Mr. Sheldon's experiments, both in\r\nrelation to tanning and dying, and are well satisfied that the\r\ndiscoverer has not overrated, or erroneously estimated, the value\r\nof his own results. We are persuaded that the highly _useful_ arts\r\nalluded to, will derive important aid from the use of a material so\r\nabundant and cheap as chesnut wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_To Professor Silliman._\r\n\r\n  _Springfield, Mass. Feb. 27, 1819._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nI send you a more particular account of the newly discovered\r\nproperties of the chesnut.\r\n\r\nThis tree, _Fagus Castanea_, Linn. is very abundant in New-England\r\nand the middle states; and occurs in the mountainous districts, as\r\nfar southward as South-Carolina, or perhaps even Georgia. It is one\r\nof the stateliest trees of the forest; scarcely less distinguished\r\nby the beauty of its foliage, than by the durability of its wood.\r\n\r\nBy repeated analyses, conducted with the minutest attention to\r\nevery circumstance which could ensure accuracy, it appears,\r\nincredible as it may seem, that the chesnut _wood_ contains twice\r\nas much tannin as ross'd[45] _oak bark_, and six-sevenths as much\r\ncolouring matter (which gives a black with iron,) as logwood. I am\r\naware that nothing could be farther from the common apprehension\r\nthan such results; but the uniform success of a great variety of\r\nexperiments in tanning and dying, in addition to the other kind of\r\nevidence, should satisfy the most incredulous.\r\n\r\nThe leather tanned with it, has, in every instance, been superior\r\nto that tanned in a comparative experiment, with oak bark; being\r\nfirmer, less porous, and at the same time more pliable. The reason\r\nfor this difference, will probably be found in the _high state\r\nof oxygenizement_ of the bark, particularly of the epidermis, by\r\nwhich it is rendered to a certain degree acrid and corrosive. Dr.\r\nBancroft was perhaps the first who noticed the oxygenizement of\r\nbarks. He attributes the dark brown colour of the epidermis of\r\n_his_ quercitron, to this cause; and as a confirmation of the idea,\r\nI have observed that ink made of the epidermis of another kind of\r\nbark, though at first not to be distinguished by the colour from\r\nthat made of the cellular and cortical parts, is incomparably less\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\nAs a material for making ink, the wood of the chesnut is probably\r\nunrivalled. Combined with iron in any proportion, it gives, as it\r\nis dilute or concentrated, a pure blue or blue-black; while galls,\r\nsumach, &c. &c. unless combined with a greater proportion than is\r\nconsistent with the highest degree of permanency, afford a _black_\r\nmore or less inclining to a reddish brown. The lake of the chesnut\r\nis indeed a blue, and not to be distinguished by the eye from\r\nindigo; but when diffused on paper, this same substance becomes an\r\nintense shining black. In dying, little difference is observable\r\nbetween the chesnut and galls, and sumach, except that the former\r\nhas a rather greater affinity for wool, &c. than the latter, and of\r\ncourse requires less boiling. Its permanency has been completely\r\ntested by long exposure to the sun and the weather; but no doubt\r\ncan exist on this head, if the position of Berthollet be true, that\r\npermanent blacks are formed only by the combination of iron and\r\ntannin.\r\n\r\nTo prepare the chesnut wood for the purposes of tanning, a mode\r\nhas been devised for reducing it to a suitable degree of fineness.\r\nThis method consists in the application of knives, either in the\r\ndirection of, or transversely to the grain, by a rotatory motion.\r\nThis mode obviously involves the greatest possible economy of\r\nmoving power. Messrs. B. and M. Stebbins, of West-Springfield, who\r\nare making arrangements for going largely into the exportation of\r\nthe article, have in construction a machine upon this plan.\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the inspissated aqueous extract of the\r\nchesnut, bears a near resemblance in many particulars, to catechu.\r\nProfessor Dewey, of William's College, who at my request, has gone\r\nthrough an extensive and elaborate course of experiments, informed\r\nme that he obtained a quarter more of the gelatinous precipitate\r\nfrom the former, than from the latter. By the taste, the two\r\nsubstances are not to be distinguished, except that the former is\r\nmore pungent. It leaves upon the tongue, the same permanent and\r\nrefreshing sweetness, for which the other is so much prized in the\r\neast; where it is used as an article of luxury, with betel nut.\r\nMight not the extract be advantageously substituted for catechu,\r\nin the celebrated life preserving composition of Dr. Pearson; the\r\nobject being to concentrate the greatest possible quantity of\r\nnutritious and tonic substances in the smallest weight.\r\n\r\nThe colouring properties of the two substances, are entirely\r\ndifferent. After the discovery, twelve or fifteen years since,\r\nof the composition of the _terra japonica_, attempts were made\r\nin England to introduce it into the materia tingentia, as a\r\nsubstitute for galls; but unfortunately, like the extract of\r\nquercitron, it affords with iron nothing but a meagre olive; and\r\nDr. Bancroft states, that in a great number of trials, he was\r\nunable, by the greatest accumulation, to produce any thing like a\r\nblack, even upon wool, much less upon cotton and silk.\r\n\r\nA singular fact, which I observed in the course of my experiments,\r\nis worthy of notice. I had prepared for a certain purpose,\r\nsolutions from the wood of the trunk of a tree, about three feet,\r\nand from that of a limb about three inches in diameter. The same\r\nquantity of wood and of the solvent was employed in both cases.\r\nOn adding to each the same quantity of the solution of gelatine,\r\nabundant precipitates immediately appeared, as usual, apparently\r\nmuch the same in quantity; but to my astonishment, the size of\r\nthe several congeries in each, bore a near proportion to that of\r\nthe sticks from which they were obtained, not differing much from\r\nthat of middling and of very small flakes of snow. Is not this an\r\nextraordinary fact, evincive of a complication in the arrangement\r\nof these bodies hitherto unsuspected. May it not at some future\r\nperiod, lead to a _nomenclature of precipitates_; affording, like\r\nthe crystallography of Haüy, a new and accurate mode of determining\r\nthe compositions of substances; and perhaps throwing light upon the\r\nobscure subject of chemical, or if you please, electro-chemical\r\naffinities. The _size_ of a stick might probably be ascertained\r\nwith almost as much precision, as by actual admeasurement. The\r\nsolutions in this experiment, were formed by maceration in cold\r\nwater. When hot water was employed, and the process was completed\r\nin two or three hours, the appearance of the precipitate was very\r\ndifferent, the congeries being smaller, irregular, and not well\r\ndefined.\r\n\r\nI have only to add, that having taken measures to secure the\r\ndiscovery, both in this country and Europe, it is my wish to bring\r\nit into general use as speedily as possible.\r\n\r\n  I am, Sir, very respectfully,\r\n\r\n  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  WILLIAM SHELDON.\r\n\r\nP. S. In a short article for some future number, I may send you\r\nan account of the operation of the machine, and of some other\r\nparticulars.\r\n\r\n\r\n23. _Additional note concerning the Tungsten and Tellurium._\r\n\r\nWe have not room to insert in the present number, a description\r\nand a chemical examination of the ores of tungsten and tellurium\r\nrecently discovered in Connecticut; they will appear in our next.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time it may be stated, that the tungsten and tellurium\r\nare found blended in the same pieces, but whether in mere mixture,\r\nor in chemical combination, is not yet quite determined. Many\r\nspecimens of the tungsten exist without the tellurium, but every\r\npiece which has afforded tellurium has also afforded tungsten,\r\nand in greater abundance. Even in well defined crystals, both\r\nmetals have been found in the same crystal, and where the external\r\nappearance was homogeneous. In other specimens a difference seems\r\nto be apparent, and a proper ore of tellurium appears to be blended\r\nwith a proper ore of tungsten. This latter ore is the wolfram,\r\ncomposed of oxid of tungsten, or as some choose to say, tungstic\r\noxid combined with iron and manganese. The crystals, however,\r\nare octahedral, a fact which we believe is not mentioned of this\r\nspecies by authors, although this form is found in the calcareous\r\ntungsten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Bismuth mine in which these ores are found is the property\r\nof Mr. Ephraim Lane. Letters addressed, post paid, to him at New\r\nStratford, town of Huntington, Connecticut, will find him through\r\nthe Post Office; and he will, for a reasonable compensation, pack\r\nboxes more or less extensive, for mineralogists and others. As Mr.\r\nLane is by occupation a farmer, and is obliged to blast a quartz\r\ngangue in order to obtain his specimens, he cannot be expected to\r\ntransmit them gratis. His mine, which has been sunk only ten feet,\r\naffords native bismuth, native silver, magnetical and common iron\r\npyrites, and copper pyrites, (the two latter crystallized) galena,\r\nblende, tungsten, tellurium, &c.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the shaft will soon be sunk deeper, when\r\nprobably a more abundant supply of good specimens will be obtained.\r\n\r\nN. B. The silver and galena are the least abundant.\r\n\r\n  _March 8th, 1819._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[28] Vide Edin.

I. _On the Geology, Mineralogy, Scenery, and Curiosities of\r\nParts of Virginia, Tennessee, and of the Alabama and Mississippi\r\nTerritories, &c. with Miscellaneous Remarks, &c. In a Letter to the\r\nEditor._ By the REV. ELIAS CORNELIUS.\r\n\r\n(Concluded from page 226.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI will conclude this part of the narrative with a brief notice of a\r\nfew curiosities occurring in the region which has been described.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Caves._\r\n\r\n1. It is well known that it furnishes a great number of interesting\r\n_caves_. They are found alike in the inclined and horizontal\r\nstrata. Some of them are several miles in extent, and afford fine\r\nspecimens of earthy and alkaline salts.\r\n\r\nWier's cave in Virginia has been described by Mr. Kain. I have in\r\nmy possession a map of its most important apartments, including\r\nits whole length, copied from a survey made by Mr. J. Pack in Oct.\r\n1806; also the notes of another survey made in May 1816, by the\r\nRev. Conrad Speece of Augusta county, and Mr. Robert Grattan;\r\nwhich, with an explanation, and particular description, I hope to\r\nbe able to transmit to you at a future time.\r\n\r\nFrom these surveys, it appears that the whole extent of the cave,\r\nhitherto discovered, does not exceed eight hundred yards. This was\r\nthe length stated to me by the guide, when I visited it in August,\r\n1817. I cannot but think there is some mistake in Mr. Kain's\r\nremark, that \"it is a mile and a half in extent.\" I spent four\r\nhours in examining every accessible part, and by permission of Mr.\r\nHenry Bingham, the owner, made a large collection of specimens,\r\nwhich were transmitted for the Cabinet of Yale College.[46]\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Natural Bridge._\r\n\r\n2. My object m naming this celebrated curiosity, is not to give a\r\nnew description of it, but merely to furnish a correct account of\r\nits dimensions. I visited it in company with the Rev. Mr. Huson,\r\nwho had previously found its height by a cord, to be two hundred\r\nand ten feet. We now found it by the quadrant, to be two hundred\r\nand eleven feet, and the arch through the centre about forty feet.\r\n\r\nSome have attempted to account for this great curiosity, by\r\nsupposing that a convulsion in nature may have rent the hill,\r\nin which it stands, asunder; thus forming the deep and narrow\r\ndefile, over which the rocky strata were left, which constitute its\r\nmagnificent arch. If so; the sides should have corresponding parts.\r\nAt a distance from the base, no such correspondence is perceptible.\r\nAt the base, the rocks are more or less craggy and irregular.\r\nThis led me to take the courses and distances of each side. The\r\nfollowing was the result.\r\n\r\n  Eastern side presents 4 angular points.\r\n\r\n  1. N. 55°  W. 1 chain.   09   links.\r\n  2. N. 72   W. 1 ------   05½  ------\r\n  3. N. 57   W. 1 ------   12½  ------\r\n  4. N. 50   W. 0 ------   33   ------\r\n\r\n  Western side presents 3 angular points.\r\n\r\n  1. N. 50°  W. 0 chain.   45   links.\r\n  2. N. 67   W. 1 ------   12½  ------\r\n  3. N. 77   W. 1 ------   44   ------\r\n\r\nThe chain used contained 50 links, equal to 33 feet and ⅓. The\r\ndistance between the abutments at the north end of their bases, is\r\n80 feet; at the south end, 66 feet. As they ascend, the distance is\r\ngreater. These data give the following diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAlthough considerable resemblance appears at the base, yet as no\r\nsuch correspondence is visible 40 feet above it, and the sides\r\nfor the whole remaining distance to the arch, one hundred and\r\nthirty feet, lose their craggy appearance entirely, and present\r\nthe smooth, irregular surface of the oldest rocks. I am led to\r\nthink that the natural bridge is coeval with a very remote period\r\nof time. Nor is there any difficulty even in supposing it to have\r\nproceeded from the hand of the Almighty, as it is; for great and\r\nmarvellous are all his works!\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote will evince the effect which the sight of\r\nthe natural bridge produced on a servant, who, without having\r\nreceived any definite or adequate ideas of what he was to see,\r\nattended his master to this spot.\r\n\r\nOn the summit of the hill, or from the top of the Bridge, the\r\nview is not more awful than that which is seen from the brink of\r\na hundred other precipices. The grand prospect is from below. To\r\nreach it you must descend the hill by a blind path, which winds\r\nthrough a thicket of trees, and terminates at the instant when the\r\nwhole bridge with its broad sides and lofty arch, all of solid\r\nrock, appears perfectly in sight. Not one in a thousand can forbear\r\nto make an involuntary pause: but the servant, who had hitherto\r\nfollowed his master, without meeting with any thing particularly\r\nto arrest his attention, had no sooner arrived at this point, and\r\ncaught a glance of the object which burst upon his vision, than he\r\nfell upon his knees, fixed in wonder and admiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A River flowing from a Cave._\r\n\r\n3. I will next mention _a singular cave_, which I do not remember\r\never to have seen described. It is situated in the Cherokee\r\ncountry, at Nicojack, the north-western angle in the map of\r\nGeorgia, and is known by the name of the Nicojack cave. It is 20\r\nmiles S. W. of the Look-Out mountain, and half a mile from the\r\nsouth bank of the Tennessee River. The Rackoon mountain in which\r\nit is situated, here fronts to the northeast. Immense layers of\r\nhorizontal limestone form a precipice of considerable height. In\r\nthis precipice the cave commences; not however with an opening\r\nof a few feet, as is common; but with a mouth fifty feet high,\r\nand one hundred and sixty wide. Its roof is formed by a solid and\r\nregular layer of limestone, having no support but the sides of\r\nthe cave, and as level as the floor of a house. The entrance is\r\npartly obstructed by piles of fallen rocks, which appear to have\r\nbeen dislodged by some great convulsion. From its entrance, the\r\ncave consists chiefly of one grand excavation through the rocks,\r\npreserving for a great distance the same dimensions as at its mouth.\r\n\r\nWhat is more remarkable than all, it forms for the whole distance\r\nit has yet been explored, a walled and vaulted passage, for a\r\nstream of cool and limpid water, which, where it leaves the cave,\r\nis six feet deep and sixty feet wide. A few years since, Col. James\r\nOre of Tennessee, commencing early in the morning, followed the\r\ncourse of this creek in a canoe, for three miles. He then came to\r\na fall of water, and was obliged to return, without making any\r\nfurther discovery. Whether he penetrated three miles up the cave\r\nor not, it is a fact he did not return till the evening, having\r\nbeen busily engaged in his subterranean voyage for twelve hours.\r\nHe stated that the course of the cave after proceeding some way to\r\nthe southwest became south; and southeast by south, the remaining\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural Nitre._\r\n\r\nThe sides of the principal excavation present a few apartments\r\nwhich are interesting, principally because they furnish large\r\nquantities of the earth from which the nitrate of potash is\r\nobtained. This is a circumstance very common to the caves of the\r\nwestern country. In that at Nicojack, it abounds, and is found\r\ncovering the surfaces of fallen rocks, but in more abundance\r\nbeneath them. There are two kinds, one is called the \"clay dirt,\"\r\nthe other the \"black dirt;\" the last is much more strongly\r\nimpregnated than the first. For several years there has been a\r\nconsiderable manufacture of saltpetre from this earth. The process\r\nis by lixiviation and crystallization, and is very simple. The\r\nearth is thrown into a hopper, and the fluid obtained, passed\r\nthrough another of ashes, the alkali of which decomposes the earthy\r\nnitrate, and uniting with its acid, which contains chiefly nitrate\r\nof lime, turns it into nitrate of potash. The precipitated lime\r\ngives the mass a whitish colour, and the consistence of curdled\r\nmilk. By allowing it to stand in a large trough, the precipitate,\r\nwhich is principally lime, subsides, and the superincumbent fluid,\r\nnow an alkaline, instead of an earthy nitrate, is carefully removed\r\nand boiled for some time in iron kettles, till it is ready to\r\ncrystallize. It is then removed again to a large trough, in which\r\nit shoots into crystals. It is now called \"rough shot-petre.\" In\r\nthis state it is sent to market, and sells usually for sixteen\r\ndollars per hundred weight. Sometimes it is dissolved in water,\r\nreboiled, and recrystallized, when it is called refined, and sells\r\nfor twenty dollars per hundred. One bushel of the clay dirt yields\r\nfrom 3 to 5lbs. and the black dirt from 7 to 10lbs. of the rough\r\nshot-petre. The same dirt, if returned to the cave, and scattered\r\non the rocks, or mingled with the new earth, becomes impregnated\r\nwith the nitrate again, and in a few months may be thrown into the\r\nhopper, and be subjected to a new process.\r\n\r\nThe causes which have produced the nitric salts of these caves, may\r\nnot yet have been fully developed. But it is highly probable, they\r\nare to be ascribed to the decomposition of animal substances.\r\n\r\nIt is reasonable to suppose, that in an uncultivated country\r\nthey would become the abodes of wild animals, and even of savage\r\nmen. That they have been used by the natives as burial places,\r\nis certain. In one which I entered, I counted a hundred human\r\nskulls, in the space of twenty feet square. All the lesser and\r\nmore corruptible parts of each skeleton had mouldered to dust, and\r\nthe whole lay in the greatest confusion. I have heard of many such\r\ncaves, and to this day some of the Indians are known to deposit\r\ntheir dead in them. From the decomposition of such substances, it\r\nis well known the acid of the nitric salts arises, and it would of\r\ncourse unite with the lime every where present, and form nitrate of\r\nlime.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mounds._\r\n\r\n4. I have but one more article of curiosity to mention under this\r\ndivision. It is one of those artificial _mounds_ which occur so\r\nfrequently in the western country. I have seen many of them, and\r\nread of more. But never of one of such dimensions as that which I\r\nam now to describe.\r\n\r\nIt is situated in the interior of the Cherokee nation, on the north\r\nside of the Etowee, vulgarly called Hightower River, one of the\r\nbranches of the Koosee. It stands upon a strip of alluvial land,\r\ncalled _River Bottom_. I visited it in company with eight Indian\r\nchiefs. The first object which excited attention was an excavation\r\nabout twenty feet wide, and in some parts ten feet deep. Its course\r\nis nearly that of a semicircle; the extremities extending towards\r\nthe river, which forms a small elbow. I had not time to examine it\r\nminutely. An Indian said it extended each way to the river, and\r\nhad several unexcavated parts, which served for passages to the\r\narea which it encloses. To my surprise, I found no embankment on\r\neither side of it. But I did not long doubt to what place the earth\r\nhad been removed; for I had scarcely proceeded two hundred yards,\r\nwhen, through the thick forest trees, a stupendous pile met the\r\neye, whose dimensions were in full proportion to the intrenchment.\r\nI had at the time no means of taking an accurate admeasurement.\r\nTo supply my deficiency, I cut a long vine, which was preserved\r\nuntil I had an opportunity of ascertaining its exact length. In\r\nthis manner I found the distance from the margin of the summit to\r\nthe base, to be one hundred and eleven feet. And judging from the\r\ndegree of its declivity, the _perpendicular height_ cannot be less\r\nthan seventy-five feet. The circumference of the base, including\r\nthe feet of three parapets, measured one thousand one hundred and\r\nfourteen feet. One of these parapets extends from the base to the\r\nsummit, and can be ascended, though with difficulty, on horseback.\r\nThe other two, after rising thirty or forty feet, terminate in a\r\nkind of triangular platform. Its top is level, and at the time\r\nI visited it, was so completely covered with weeds, bushes, and\r\ntrees of most luxuriant growth, that I could not examine it as\r\nwell as I wished. Its diameter, I judged, must be one hundred and\r\nfifty feet. On its sides and summit, are many large trees of the\r\nsame description, and of equal dimensions with those around it.\r\nOne beach-tree, near the top, measured ten feet nine inches in\r\ncircumference. The earth on one side of the tree, was three and a\r\nhalf feet lower than on the opposite side. This fact will give a\r\ngood idea of the degree of the mound's declivity. An oak, which\r\nwas lying down on one of the parapets, measured at the distance of\r\nsix feet from the butt, without the bark, twelve feet four inches\r\nin circumference. At a short distance to the southeast is another\r\nmound, in ascending which I took thirty steps. Its top is encircled\r\nby a breastwork three feet high, intersected through the middle\r\nwith another elevation of a similar kind. A little farther is\r\nanother mound, which I had not time to examine.\r\n\r\nOn these great works of art, the Indians gazed with as much\r\ncuriosity as any white man. I inquired of the oldest chief, if the\r\nnatives had any tradition respecting them; to which he answered in\r\nthe negative. I then requested each to say what he supposed was\r\ntheir origin. Neither could tell: though all agreed in saying;\r\n\"they were never put up by our people.\" It seems probable they\r\nwere erected by another race, who once inhabited the country.\r\nThat such a race existed, is now generally admitted. Who they\r\nwere, and what were the causes of their degeneracy, or of their\r\nextermination, no circumstances have yet explained. But this is no\r\nreason why we should not, as in a hundred other instances, infer\r\nthe existence of the cause from its effects, without any previous\r\nknowledge of its history.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the objects which these mounds were designed to\r\nanswer, it is obvious they were not always the same. Some were\r\nintended as receptacles for the dead. These are small, and are\r\ndistinguished by containing human bones. Some may have been\r\ndesigned as sites for public buildings, whether of a civil or\r\nreligious kind; and others no doubt were constructed for the\r\npurposes of war. Of this last description, is the Etowee mound. In\r\nproof of its suitableness for such a purpose, I need only mention\r\nthat the Cherokees in their late war with the Creeks, secured its\r\nsummit by pickets, and occupied it as a place of protection for\r\nhundreds of their women and children. Gladly would I have spent\r\na day in examining it more minutely; but my companions, unable\r\nto appreciate my motives, grew impatient, and I was obliged to\r\nwithdraw, and leave a more perfect observation and description to\r\nsome one else.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alluvial Formation._\r\n\r\nI will now call your attention to the last geological division\r\nwhich came under my observation. It is the alluvial tract,\r\nextending from the Dividing Ridge already mentioned, to the Gulf of\r\nMexico. This Ridge is the last range of high land which I crossed\r\non the journey to New Orleans, and lies about six hundred miles\r\nnorth of the Gulf of Mexico. Its course at the place I crossed\r\nit, is a little south of west. It divides the waters of the\r\nTennessee from those which proceed directly to the gulf. Travellers\r\nalways observe it. They often mentioned it to me as the southern\r\nboundary of the _stony country_. After crossing it, you see no\r\nmore limestone; and, which excites more joy in the traveller, no\r\nmore of the silicious gravel, with which it is associated, and\r\nwhich is so troublesome to the feet of horses. The soil consists\r\nof a soft clay, or light sand, on which you seldom meet with a\r\nstone of any kind. The surface of the earth is undulating and\r\nhilly, but not mountainous. The water-courses do not move rapidly\r\nand tumultuously, as in the limestone country; but form in the\r\nsoft earth, deep trenches, through which they glide smoothly and\r\nsilently along. The smallest rivulet often has a trench ten feet\r\ndeep; and the earth over which it passes, is continually yielding\r\nto its gentle attrition.\r\n\r\nThe only minerals which I observed, are sandstone, common and\r\nferruginous; silicious pebbles in beds of creeks, and occasionally\r\non the uplands; earthy ores of iron, particularly red oxides, and\r\npetrifactions of shells, wood, &c. In addition to these, it may\r\nhere be mentioned that galena has been found in small quantities at\r\nGibson's Port, and at Ellis's Cliffs, in the State of Mississippi:\r\na crystal of amethyst, in the same state, by Mr. Blannerhassett;\r\nand a great variety of useful ochres, in many places on the banks\r\nof the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nIn the geological map attached to Professor Cleaveland's\r\nMineralogy, the alluvial country bordering on the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nis represented as terminating at Natchez. But why its termination\r\nis placed here, I am unable to understand. The country above and\r\nbelow Natchez, so far as it has come under my observation, presents\r\nno difference of appearance in its geology, or mineralogy. I\r\nam aware that at Natchez, when the water of the Mississippi is\r\nlowest, a soft rock is seen, from which lime has been obtained.\r\nBut this rock is two hundred feet below the surface of the\r\nadjoining country; and admitting that it is a limestone rock,\r\nthere is no difficulty in supposing it may constitute the basis\r\nof the alluvial deposit which rests upon it. That the incumbent\r\nearth is _alluvial_, can be doubted, I think, by no one who has\r\nhad an opportunity of examining it. By means of a road, which has\r\nbeen cut obliquely down the side of the bluff, distinct layers of\r\nclay, sand, and pebbles, have been exposed for the whole distance\r\nfrom the summit to the base. The same character is observed at a\r\ndistance from the river, where the earth has been excavated by\r\nwashing, or digging. In the vicinity of the town, there is a\r\ncurious exhibition of the fact. A stream of water has worn away the\r\nearth to the depth of fifteen or twenty feet, and is continually\r\nlengthening the chasm, in the direction opposite to its own course.\r\nThus, as the water flows from the town, the chasm approaches it. In\r\nexamining the cause of this fact, I perceived it was owing chiefly\r\nto the difference of cohesion in the alluvial deposits, of which\r\nthe earth is formed. That at the surface, being a thick loam,\r\nwears away with more difficulty than the deposit below it, which\r\nconsists of a loose sand. The consequence is, that the water, which\r\nhas once obtained a perpendicular passage of a few inches through\r\nthe first, washes away the second with such rapidity, that it is\r\nconstantly undermining it. This occasions a perpetual caving in of\r\nthe surface, in a direction opposite to the course of the stream.\r\nThe same fact is observed in many parts of the country for a great\r\ndistance above Natchez. If there be wanting any other fact to prove\r\nthat the earth on which the town of Natchez stands, is alluvial, it\r\nis found in the effect which the Mississippi has upon the base of\r\nthe Natchez bluff. In consequence of a bend in the river, the whole\r\nforce of its current is thrown against this base. If it consisted\r\nof solid rock, the river would probably have no effect upon it; but\r\nof such loose and friable materials is it composed, that the river\r\nis continually undermining it, and producing effects not less to\r\nbe dreaded than those of an earthquake. Several years ago, a great\r\nnumber of acres sunk fifty feet or more below the general surface\r\nof the hill; and in 1805, there was another caving of that part\r\ndirectly over the small village at the landing. Several houses\r\nwere buried in consequence of it, and strong fears are entertained\r\nby the inhabitants, that the same cause will yet submerge in the\r\nMississippi, the whole of the present landing-place.\r\n\r\nThese facts, I think you will say, furnish satisfactory evidence\r\nof the alluvial character of the country at Natchez. The same\r\ncharacter belongs to the whole extent south of the Dividing Ridge.\r\nThis may be safely inferred from the general features of the\r\ncountry. But I have two facts, of a geological kind, to mention,\r\nboth of which go to confirm the opinion.\r\n\r\n1. A well was dug in the Choctaw nation, at the agency of the\r\nUnited States, in the year 1812 or 1813, under the direction of\r\nSilas Dinsmore, Esq. the agent. The excavation was continued\r\nto the depth of one hundred and seventy-two feet. No water was\r\nfound. At no great distance from the surface, marine exuviæ were\r\nfound in abundance. The shells were small, and imbedded in a soft\r\nclay, similar to marine earth. This formation continued till the\r\nexcavation ceased. Dispersed through it, were found lumps of\r\nselenite, or foliated gypsum, some of which were half as large as a\r\nman's fist. Specimens of the earth, the exuviæ, and the selenite,\r\nhave been transmitted for your examination. This excavation was\r\nmade one hundred and twenty miles north northeast of Natchez. The\r\nPearl River is four miles to the east of the place, and is the only\r\nconsiderable stream in this part of the country.\r\n\r\n2. In the Chickasaw nation, one hundred and seventy miles north of\r\nthe Choctaw agency, commence beds of oyster-shells, which continue\r\nto be seen at intervals for twelve miles. Four miles from the\r\nfirst bed, you come to what is called \"Chickasaw Old Town,\" where\r\nthey are observed in great abundance. They are imbedded in low\r\nridges of a white marl. They appear to be of two kinds. Specimens\r\nof each, and also of the marl, you have received. \"Chickasaw Old\r\nTown,\" is a name now appropriated to a prairie, on a part of which\r\nthere formerly stood a small village of Chickasaws. The prairie is\r\ntwenty miles long, and four wide. The shells occur in three places\r\nas you cross it, and again, on two contiguous hills to the east of\r\nit, at the distance of four miles. They do not cover the surface\r\nmerely. They form a constituent part of the hills or plains in\r\nwhich they are found. Wherever the earth has been washed so as to\r\nproduce deep gutters, they are seen in greatest abundance. Nor are\r\nthey petrifactions, such as are found in rocks. They have the same\r\nappearance as common oyster-shells, they lie loose in the earth,\r\nand thus indicate a comparatively recent origin. They occur _three\r\nhundred miles_ northeast of Natchez, and but _sixty_ miles south of\r\nthe Dividing Ridge.\r\n\r\nIf the country north of Natchez is alluvial, no one will doubt\r\nit is so from this place to the Gulf of Mexico. At Baton Rouge,\r\none hundred and forty miles north of New Orleans, you meet the\r\nfirst elevated land in ascending from the gulf. The banks of the\r\nMississippi are higher than the interior, and would be annually\r\noverflowed by the river, but for a narrow embankment of earth about\r\nsix feet high, called the Levee. By means of this, a narrow strip\r\nof land, from half a mile to a mile in width, is redeemed, and\r\ncultivated with cotton and the sugar cane, to the great advantage\r\nof the planter. Generally, within one mile from the river, there is\r\nan impenetrable morass. The country has every where the appearance\r\nof an origin comparatively recent. Not a rock on which you can\r\nstand, and no mountain to gladden the eye; you seem to have left\r\nthe older parts of creation to witness the encroachments which\r\nthe earth is continually making upon the empire of the sea; and\r\non arriving at the mouth of the Mississippi, you find the grand\r\ninstruments of nature in active operation, producing with slow, but\r\ncertain gradations, the same results.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A destructive Insect._\r\n\r\nBut I will not enlarge on a fact already familiar. I will ask your\r\nfurther indulgence only, while I communicate an authentic and\r\ncurious fact for the information of the zoologist.\r\n\r\nIn the Choctaw country, one hundred and thirty miles northeast of\r\nNatchez, a part of the public road is rendered famous on account of\r\nthe periodical return of a poisonous and destructive fly. Contrary\r\nto the custom of other insects, it always _appears_ when the _cold\r\nweather_ commences in December, and as invariably _disappears_\r\non the approach of _warm weather_, which is about the first of\r\nApril. It is said to have been remarked first in the winter of\r\n1807, _during a snowstorm_; when its effects upon cattle and horses\r\nwere observed to be similar to those of the gnat and musqueto, in\r\nsummer, except that they were more severe. It continued to return\r\nat the same season of the year, without producing extensive\r\nmischief, until the winter of 1816, when it began to be generally\r\nfatal to the horses of travellers. So far as I recollect, it\r\nwas stated, that from thirty to forty travelling horses were\r\ndestroyed during this winter. The consequences were alarming. In\r\nthe wilderness, where a man's horse is his chief dependence, the\r\ntraveller was surprised and distressed to see the beast sicken and\r\ndie in convulsions, sometimes within three hours after encountering\r\nthis little insect. Or if the animal were fortunate enough to live,\r\na sickness followed, commonly attended with the sudden and entire\r\nshedding of the hair, which rendered the brute unfit for use.\r\nUnwilling to believe that effects so dreadful could be produced by\r\na cause apparently trifling, travellers began to suspect that the\r\nIndians, or others, of whom they obtained food for their horses,\r\nhad, for some base and selfish end, mingled poison with it. The\r\ngreatest precaution was observed. They refused to stop at any house\r\non the way, and carried, for the distance of forty or fifty miles,\r\ntheir own provision; but after all suffered the same calamities.\r\nThis excited a serious inquiry into the true cause of their\r\ndistress. The fly, which has been mentioned, was known to be a most\r\nsingular insect, and peculiarly troublesome to horses. At length\r\nit was admitted by all, that the cause of the evils complained of\r\ncould be no other than this insect. Other precautions have since\r\nbeen observed, particularly that of riding over the road infested\r\nwith it _in the night_; and now it happens that comparatively\r\nfew horses are destroyed. I am unable to describe it from my own\r\nobservation. I passed over the same road in April last, only two\r\nweeks after it disappeared, and was obliged to take the description\r\nfrom others. Its colour is a dark brown; it has an elongated head,\r\nwith a small and sharp proboscis; and is in size between the gnat\r\nand musqueto. When it alights upon a horse, it darts through the\r\nhair, much like a gnat, and never quits its hold until removed by\r\nforce. When a horse stops to drink, swarms fly about the head, and\r\ncrowd into the mouth, nostrils, and ears; hence it is supposed the\r\npoison is communicated inwardly. Whether this be true or not, the\r\nmost fatal consequences result. It is singular, that from the\r\ntime of its first appearance, it has never extended for a greater\r\ndistance than forty miles, in one direction, and usually, it is\r\nconfined to fifteen miles. In no other part of the country has it\r\never been seen. From this fact, it would seem probable that the\r\ncause of its existence is local. But what it is, none can tell.\r\nAfter the warm weather commences, it disappears as effectually from\r\nhuman observation, as if it were annihilated. Towards the close of\r\nDecember it springs up all at once into being again, and resumes\r\nthe work of destruction. A fact, so singular, I could not have\r\nventured to state, without the best evidence of its reality. All\r\nthe circumstances here related, are familiar to hundreds, and were\r\nin almost every man's mouth, when I passed through the country.\r\nIn addition to this, they were confirmed by the account which I\r\nreceived from Col. John M'Kee, a gentleman of much intelligence and\r\nrespectability, who is the present agent of the general government\r\nfor the Choctaw nation. He has consented to obtain specimens of\r\nthe insect for your examination, when it returns again; and will,\r\nI hope, accompany the transmission with a more perfect description\r\nthan it has been possible for me to communicate.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this narrative of facts, I should be glad to take a\r\ncomprehensive view of the whole. The bold features in the geology\r\nof the United States, as they are drawn by the Blue Ridge, the\r\nCumberland with its associated mountains, and the Dividing Ridge,\r\ndeserve to be distinctly and strongly impressed upon the mind. Such\r\nis the order and regularity of their arrangement, that they can\r\nhardly fail to conduct the attentive observer to important results.\r\nWhat has now been said of them, is but an epitome of the whole. I\r\ntrust the public will soon read, in the pages of your Journal, a\r\ndetail more perfect and more interesting. And allow me to suggest,\r\nwhether, under the auspices of our learned societies, some men\r\nof science might not be employed and supported in exploring the\r\ncountry, with the prospect of greatly enlarging the science of our\r\ncountry, and of enriching our Journals and Cabinets of Natural\r\nHistory. Tours of discovery have often been made for other objects,\r\nand with success. Our country yields to no other in the variety,\r\nor the value of its natural productions. We owe it to ourselves and\r\nto the world, to search them out with diligence and without delay.\r\n\r\n_Somers, (N. Y.) Oct. 1818._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. II. _On the Origin of Prairies._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _St. Louis, (Missouri Ter.) March 3, 1819._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\nThe probable cause of the origin and continuance of _prairies_\r\nhas been the subject of much speculation among the learned and\r\ncurious. The inquiry is interesting; and many theories have arisen;\r\nbut although plausible and ingenious, they are, in my opinion,\r\nunfounded in fact.\r\n\r\nI should be glad to see the following remarks, which were called\r\nforth more particularly by the speculations of Caleb Atwater, Esq.\r\n(See No. 2. p. 116. of this work) appear in your valuable Journal\r\nof Science; and they are, for that purpose, at your service.\r\n\r\n  With high respect, I am, Sir, your's,\r\n  R. W. WELLS.\r\n\r\n  _Benjamin Silliman, Esq._\r\n\r\nMr. Atwater, after describing the prairies and barrens, says, that\r\naccording to the common opinion, they \"were occasioned entirely\r\nby the burning of the woods,\" but, \"erroneous information first\r\npropagated such an opinion, and blind credulity has extended it\r\ndown to us.\" Mr. A. goes on to affirm that, \"wherever prairies and\r\nbarrens are found, there, for a long space of time, water once\r\nstood, but was gradually drained off.\" The writer of this having\r\noften visited and observed with attention the nature and appearance\r\nof the prairies on the Alleghany mountains, in the states of Ohio,\r\nIndiana, and Illinois, and having long been employed by the United\r\nStates as a surveyor in the prairie country of the Missouri and\r\nMissisippi, thinks he may venture to oppose these speculations\r\nwithout being thought presumptuous. He is of opinion, that the\r\nvast prairies and barrens, extending over the greater part of the\r\nwestern states, and over nearly all Louisiana, were primitively\r\noccasioned, and have been since continued, by the _combustion of\r\nvegetables_, and that _water_ had no agency in their formation.\r\n\r\nIn order to prove the high prairies of the state of Ohio to have\r\nbeen once covered by the waters of Lake Erie, Mr. A. maintains,\r\nthat the channel of the Niagara river has been worn down \"_several\r\nhundred feet_\" by the attrition of its waters. Mr. A. should have\r\nshown, that the banks of the Niagara are, at this time, several\r\nhundred feet high, or, like the Potomac, at Harper's Ferry, has\r\nbroken through a mountain \"several hundred feet\" high; but neither\r\nthe one nor the other is the fact; the face of the country, on\r\neither side of the river, is comparatively low and champaign; and\r\nwere it possible for the waters of the lake to rise considerably\r\nabove their present level, they would meet with no obstruction or\r\nimpediment, for many miles on either side the river, but would be\r\nprecipitated over the cataract, into Ontario, and down the St.\r\nLawrence to the Atlantic. But supposing there had been a mountain\r\nrunning between Lakes Erie and Ontario of sufficient height to\r\nprevent the water of the former from passing into the latter, it\r\nmust evidently have found other places through which to escape, and\r\nbefore it would rise high enough to overflow the elevated region of\r\nMadison and Fayette counties, in Ohio, it would have passed over\r\ninto the heads of the Alleghany. But it is impossible to imagine\r\nthis, unless we suppose the Atlantic to have been six or seven\r\nhundred feet higher than at present, which, according to Mr. A.\r\nwould have made prairie of all the Atlantic states.\r\n\r\nThe fact of shells and other marine substances having been found\r\nin a few places, by digging in the prairies, proves nothing, or\r\nproves too much, for they are found in equal or greater quantities\r\nall over America, in the sides and near the summit of the Alleghany\r\nmountains; on the Andes, in South America, and the Alps, in\r\nEurope. The resemblance which the soil, in the low prairies, and\r\nnot in the high, bears to the _alluvial_, can justly be attributed,\r\nit is presumed, to the leaves and other vegetables and light\r\nmaterials of which they are composed, having been washed by heavy\r\nrains, for ages past, from the higher to the lower places. This\r\nwill also account for the circumstance of trees growing upon the\r\nsummits of the hills of steep ascent: being thin and poor, the\r\ngrass neither grows sufficiently long or thick to kill the timber\r\nwhen fired. They _could not_ have been islands in this fairy\r\nlake; because their summits are frequently much _lower_ than high\r\nprairie flats a few miles distant. These are facts which will be\r\nrecollected by those who have ever travelled through a prairie\r\ncountry of any extent.\r\n\r\nBut suppose it to have been proved, that the waters of Lake Erie\r\nonce overspread the state of Ohio, from its present shore to\r\nChillicothe, (a supposition which I trust has however been shown to\r\nbe visionary) does it follow that the prairies were occasioned by\r\nsuch overflowing? If the water, by covering the country, prevented\r\nthe timber from growing, should we not naturally look for the\r\nlargest timber on the higher grounds which would be first forsaken\r\nby the waters, and for small timber on the low grounds, where the\r\nwater remained longest? If this be true, (and it is unquestionable)\r\nwe should then look for prairies on the low grounds bordering on\r\nLakes Erie, Huron, and Michigan; and the thickly timbered country\r\nwould be on the high land, near the sources of the rivers. But the\r\ncontrary is absolutely the fact: we find heavy timbered land, and\r\nno _prairies_, in the low countries north of the lakes, and none\r\nsouth, either in Michigan territory or elsewhere, until we arrive\r\nnear the sources of the rivers. It is true, that the water standing\r\nin ponds will prevent the timber from growing; but the difference\r\nis readily observed between prairies, properly so called, and those\r\nbogs.\r\n\r\nBut to prove farther that water had no agency in bringing the\r\nprairies into existence, we may mention those on and near the\r\nsummit of the Alleghany mountains, (principally in Alleghany\r\nCounty.[47]) Many of those prairies are ten or twelve miles in\r\nlength, and three or four in width. Will it be pretended that\r\nthe sides of those mountains were also lakes? Farther--the most\r\nextensive prairies known, are the very high plains immediately west\r\nof the Rocky Mountains, and east of the mountains near the sources\r\nof the Arkansaw and Missouri rivers, extending even on the spurs of\r\nthose mountains; a country the highest perhaps in North America,\r\nwith a great and continued descent to the Pacific on the one side,\r\nand to the Gulf of Mexico on the other.\r\n\r\nThe barrens, also, found in Kentucky, are another evidence that\r\nwater had no agency in their formation--they are situate, it is\r\nbelieved, in the elevated parts of the country exclusively.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this, deeming it unnecessary to say more, or to\r\nproduce more facts, (although much more may be said, and many more\r\nfacts produced) to prove that prairies were not lakes, will now\r\nendeavour to prove that they were occasioned by the _combustion of\r\nvegetables_.\r\n\r\nPrairies are found in those countries only that are congenial to\r\nthe growth of grass, and only where the soil is sufficiently rich\r\nto produce it luxuriantly--they are found commonly on high plains,\r\nsufficiently drained to prevent water from remaining on them the\r\nwhole year; for it is by no means necessary that they should be\r\nalways dry; on the contrary, if they are sufficiently level to\r\nprevent the rains from running off immediately, the grass will grow\r\nthicker and higher--but they must be sufficiently dry to burn, at\r\nleast once in two or three years, during the long, dry season,\r\ncalled _Indian summer_. It has been universally remarked, that\r\nthese seasons are much longer as we proceed westerly--commencing\r\nusually in October, and continuing a month and a half or two\r\nmonths, during which the vegetation is killed by the frosts, and\r\ndried by the sun; the wet prairies are also dried, and before the\r\nseason has expired, the grass is perfectly combustible.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, it is presumed, (and the writer, from a residence in\r\ntheir country and with them, is well acquainted with their customs)\r\nburn the woods, not _ordinarily_ for the purpose of taking or\r\ncatching game, as suggested by Mr. A. but for many other advantages\r\nattending that practice. If the woods be not burned as usual, the\r\nhunter finds it impossible to kill the game, which, alarmed at the\r\ngreat noise made in walking through the dry grass and leaves, flee\r\nin all directions at his approach. Also the Indians travel much\r\nduring the winter, from one village to another, and to and from\r\nthe various hunting grounds, which becomes extremely painful and\r\nlaborious, from the quantity of briers, vines, grass, &c. To remedy\r\nthese and many other inconveniences, even the woods were originally\r\nburned so as to cause prairies, and for the same and like reasons\r\nthey continue to be burned towards the close of the Indian summer.\r\n\r\nWoodland is not commonly changed to prairie by one burning, but\r\nby several successive conflagrations; the first will kill the\r\nundergrowth, which causing a greater opening, and admitting the sun\r\nand air more freely, increases the quantity of grass the ensuing\r\nseason: the conflagration consequently increases, and is now\r\nsufficiently powerful to destroy the smaller timber; and on the\r\nthird year you behold an open prairie.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, all the country, of a nature to become prairie, is\r\nalready in that state; yet the writer of this has seen, in the\r\ncountry between the Missouri and Mississippi, after unusual dry\r\nseasons, more than one hundred acres of woodland together converted\r\ninto prairie. And again, where the grass has been prevented from\r\nburning by accidental causes, or the prairie has been depastured\r\nby large herds of domestic cattle, it will assume, in a few years,\r\nthe appearance of a young forest. Numerous proofs of this fact can\r\nbe adduced, but a few shall suffice. The vicinity of St. Louis and\r\nSt. Charles affords instances. Both these beautiful places are\r\nsituated on what are termed first and second bottoms, or flats--the\r\nformer on the Missisippi, the latter on the Missouri; the second\r\nor upper bottoms, in both, are high plains, that commence within\r\na few hundred yards of the rivers, and extend back many miles;\r\nall the old French inhabitants will tell you, that the prairies\r\nformerly came immediately up to those places. Now the surrounding\r\ncountry for several miles is covered with a growth of trees of four\r\nor five inches diameter, near the towns where the burning first\r\nceased, and gradually diminishing in size as you recede, until you\r\nat length gain the open prairies. So the barrens in Kentucky; many\r\nof the first settlers of that state distinctly recollect when many\r\nof those barrens were clear prairies, now partially covered with\r\nsmall trees. It is deemed unnecessary to offer more proofs, or\r\nadditional arguments, in support of the opinion that the prairies\r\nwere occasioned by _fire_, and not by _water_. Indeed one glance at\r\nthe maps of those extensive prairie countries, surveyed by order\r\nof government, where the prairies and woodland are distinguished\r\nand correctly delineated, should carry conviction. The timber will\r\nbe there observed to skirt the rivers; in the country near their\r\nsources a few solitary trees are seen, close on the banks, secure\r\nfrom the fires, and increasing in numbers as the rivers increase in\r\nsize, and the low grounds become more extensive.\r\n\r\nThe view given of the prairies by Mr. A. is correct; but was\r\ncertainly painted in the _winter_ season--they are, at that\r\nseason, bleak and uncomfortable both to the feelings and sight;\r\nbut a full return is made to both when the spring opens. The\r\nprairies (particularly to the west) are then covered with the\r\nrichest verdure, interspersed with an immense variety of wild\r\nflowers, that send forth the most grateful odours. Ascend one\r\nof the small hills, and you have a prospect as delightful as it\r\nis possible for the imagination to conceive. Far as the eye can\r\ncarry you, a delightful country extends, through which numerous\r\nstreams wind their serpentine courses, with groves and clumps of\r\ntrees at intervals upon their banks. On one hand, at an immense\r\ndistance, the small hills and groves are seen rising above the blue\r\nhorizon; on the other, the view is pleasantly terminated by the\r\nwood on the low grounds skirting the river to which the smaller\r\nstreams are tributary--while herds of buffalo, elk, deer, and other\r\nanimals, are frequently seen slowly travelling to and from the\r\nwatering-places, or grazing on the plains. The inhabited parts of\r\nthe country present a prospect still more pleasing; around the\r\nmargin of those extensive rich prairies, numerous habitations are\r\nseen, withdrawn a short distance in the wood, from the winter's\r\ncold and summer's heat--their finely cultivated fields lie in the\r\nprairies, which yield at once to the plough, without the previous\r\nHerculean labour of demolishing the forest. The area between the\r\nfarms is a common of pasture to the numerous herds during the\r\nspring, summer, and autumn, and a small part mowed affords hay\r\nfor the winter. The farmer who takes up his habitation in the\r\nneighbourhood of the prairies, has _many_ of the advantages of an\r\n_old_ inhabited country, and _all_ the advantages of the _new_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. III. _Sketch of the Mineralogy and Geology of the Vicinity of\r\nWilliams' College, Williamstown, Mass. By_ PROFESSOR DEWEY, _of\r\nWilliams' College, in a letter to the Editor_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following sketch includes a space extending from Hoosack\r\nmountain on the east, to the State of New-York on the west, and\r\na small distance into Vermont on the north. The accompanying map\r\nshows the relative situation of the streams, and the principal\r\nhills and mountains. The map is an enlarged copy of Carleton's map\r\nof this part of the state, with one or two corrections, which truth\r\nrequired. The latitude and longitude are probably not perfectly\r\naccurate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Geological MAP _of a part of Massachusetts on_\r\nConnecticut River 1817.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Transverse Section of Rock Strata from Hoosack\r\nMountain to Eleven Miles East of Connecticut River._]\r\n\r\nWilliams' College is situated in a valley, having on the west the\r\nhills of the _Taconick_[48] range; on the east, _Saddle Mountain_,\r\nwhich separates it for the most part from Adams; and on the north,\r\nand northeast, two hills which belong to the southwestern part of\r\nthe range of the _Green Mountains_. _Hoosack River_, rising several\r\nmiles at the southeast, and passing through the northeastern part\r\nof Williamstown, winds its course northwest, to the Hudson. It is\r\nan inconsiderable stream, about six rods in width, and its current\r\nis rapid. From the south, runs _Green River_, a smaller stream, and\r\nenters the Hoosack one mile northeast of the college. The _green_\r\ncolour of this stream, appears to be caused by a _magnesian_ clay,\r\nwhich is washed from its banks at the south part of the town. At\r\nthe west is _Westbrook_, rising in Williamstown, and entering the\r\nHoosack one mile and a half northwest of the college. The _soil_\r\nin this whole tract is generally _clayey_, rather light for such\r\na soil, and very rich. A gravelly soil appears in a few places,\r\nespecially at the northern part. The _interval_ on the Hoosack\r\nextends only a small distance from its banks, rarely exceeding,\r\nand often much less, than half a mile, and presents the common\r\nappearances of _alluvial_ land. Rising from ten to twenty feet\r\nabove this interval, the soil is in various places filled with\r\nrolled stones of quartz and limestone, as if the Hoosack had once\r\nbeen much above the banks which confine it at present. It is not\r\nimprobable that its waters were formerly intercepted by the hills\r\nin Pownal, five miles at the northwest, forming a small lake in\r\nthis valley.\r\n\r\nThe hills of the _Taconick_ range, (A[49]) on which passes the line\r\nbetween Massachusetts and New-York, have generally an elevation\r\nfrom twelve hundred to fourteen hundred feet; _Pownal Mountain_ (B)\r\non the north, about fourteen hundred; and _Oak hill_ (D) on the\r\nnortheast, twelve hundred feet above the east college (C.) _Saddle\r\nMountain_ (EF) is an insulated mass, separated from the Taconick\r\nrange by the valley of Williamstown, and from Hoosack Mountain, by\r\nthe valley in Adams. It lies about south southwest, and is nearly\r\neight miles in length, and two in breadth. It is composed of two\r\nranges, the eastern and highest (FG) being in Adams. The mountain\r\nhas its name from two of its peaks, which present at a distance the\r\nappearance of the two elevations of a _saddle_. The west range (E)\r\nis divided into _two parts_ quite to its base, which with the slope\r\nof the east range encloses, on three sides, an irregular hollow,\r\ncalled the _Hopper_.(H) The northern part (E) of the west range\r\nis nearly two miles in length, and rises to the height of eighteen\r\nhundred feet; the southern (I) rises abruptly into a peak of the\r\nelevation of seventeen hundred feet. The height of the valley\r\nbetween the two ranges is about fourteen hundred feet. You enter\r\nthe _Hopper_ from the west, passing along a branch of Green River,\r\nand a romantic, wild, and sublime prospect opens before you. Nearly\r\neast of the entrance into the Hopper, lies the highest point of the\r\nSaddle, familiarly called _Gray Lock_, (F) being about twenty-eight\r\nhundred feet above the college, and probably four thousand feet\r\nabove the _tide-water_ of the Hudson at Troy. This is the highest\r\nland in Massachusetts. About two miles north northeast, is the\r\nnorthern peak (G) elevated twenty-three hundred feet. The valley in\r\nAdams is bounded on the east by Hoosack mountain, (K) elevated from\r\nfourteen hundred to eighteen hundred feet, and extending several\r\nmiles west of south: it forms a part of the range which commences\r\nat _West Rock_ in Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThe country included in this sketch is principally _primitive_;\r\nlying on the west of the summit of the primitive range, which\r\npasses southerly into Connecticut. The rocks and minerals will be\r\nmentioned in the following order.\r\n\r\n1. _Granite._ A few pieces have been found at the foot of Oak\r\nhill, one mile northeast of the college. It consists principally\r\nof feldspar. Four miles east, are large masses of granite on both\r\nsides of the Hoosack, and on ascending Hoosack mountain they become\r\nmore numerous. The principal part of this is quartz, often of a\r\npurple colour; the mica black, and the rocks exceedingly hard.\r\nI have never noticed any minerals imbedded in it. The vortex of\r\nPownal mountain is also granitic.\r\n\r\n2. _Gneiss_ and _Mica Slate_. I connect these two, because they are\r\nnot often distinct, and appear to pass into each other. They are\r\nfound in large strata on Hoosack Mountain, on a hill (L) connected\r\nwith Saddle Mountain, and on the east side of Saddle Mountain. The\r\nhighest and the west ridge of Saddle Mountain are mica slate. The\r\n_Hopper_ shows the inclination of the strata quite to the base of\r\nthe mountain. The inclination is to the east and northeast, from\r\nten to forty degrees. On the southwest mountain of _Saddle_, the\r\nstrata are bare to the summit for a considerable distance, and are\r\nvery fine grained mica slate, having somewhat the appearance of\r\na _soapstone slate_. By this name they are called in Mr. Eaton's\r\nIndex to Geology. Some of the rocks appear to be _talcose_. I\r\nhave been able, however, to detect but a very minute quantity\r\nof magnesia in any specimens I have tried, though I obtained\r\na considerable proportion of alumine. The higher hills of the\r\nTaconick range are composed principally of a similar slate, lying\r\nin the same direction, and with similar inclination; but it appears\r\nto have passed still farther from mica slate. At the northwest\r\ncorner of the state, which is near the foot of the ridge in this\r\nplace, the rock is very similar to some of that on the southwest\r\nmountain mentioned above. About a mile northwest of this _corner_,\r\nthe rocks are cleft in several places, and in one, to such a depth,\r\nthat the snow and ice remain here through the year. The _Snow Hole_\r\n(M) is about thirty feet long, and nearly as deep at the east\r\nend, ascends to the west, or towards the summit of the ridge, and\r\nis from ten to twenty feet wide. When I visited it in June, the\r\nsnow was six feet deep on ice of unknown depth. The rock is here\r\npassing into _argillaceous slate_; and in many places it becomes\r\n_argillaceous_ and _chlorite slate_. For the other rock, you have,\r\nI believe, proposed the name _talcose slate_.\r\n\r\n3. _Quartz._ Though quartz is scattered through all the preceding\r\nrock in masses of different sizes, it is found in great quantity on\r\nthe northeast part of Saddle Mountain, 300 or 400 feet above the\r\ncollege, and thence to the Hoosack along the side of the hill (L.)\r\nIt is granular, often white and translucent, and often coloured\r\nwith oxyd of iron. It forms _Stone Hill_, (N) a mile southwest of\r\nthe college, on the vertex of which is argillaceous slate. This\r\nhill slopes to West Brook, where quartz often forms perpendicular\r\nbanks from 50 to 100 feet high. Here also argillaceous slate rests\r\non the quartz, as well as on the vertex, and on the east side of\r\nStone Hill. Quartz appears again on the opposite side of West\r\nBrook, but further north, on a hill connected with the Taconick\r\nrange. On these two hills, it lies in large strata, inclining,\r\nlike the mica slate, to the east and northeast, often divided by\r\nveins into rhomboidal masses. On the east side of Stone Hill, it\r\nis more granular, and may perhaps be called _arenaceous quartz_,\r\ncontaining a larger proportion of iron. Near the base of Hoosack\r\nMountain, similar quartz is found, which extends round the north\r\nside of the Hoosack to Oak Hill, (D) which is wholly composed of\r\nit. It lies in rounded fragments, called _hardheads_, through\r\nthe northern part of the valley, and on the sides of Oak Hill in\r\nhuge rocks, presenting nearly perpendicular fronts from 20 to 50\r\nfeet in height, and many rods in length. The strata are in some\r\nplaces horizontal, and in others nearly perpendicular. In one\r\nplace it forms plates, from 2 to 5 feet on a side, and from half\r\nan inch to several inches in thickness, which are nearly perfect\r\nrhomboids, the edges never being perpendicular to the sides. Most\r\nof the quartz, except the white, yields a small portion of lime,\r\nand has been called _calcareous quartz_. _Greasy quartz_, _rose\r\nquartz_, hornstone, and _rock crystal_, are occasionally found; the\r\nlast in considerable quantity south of Stone Hill. On the stream\r\nwhich issues from the _Hopper_, is arenaceous quartz of a slaty\r\nstructure, which is an excellent stone for sharpening the _chisels_\r\nused by _stonecutters_.\r\n\r\n4. _Granular Limestone_ is abundant at the _Cave_ or _Falls_, in\r\nAdams, and on both sides of the Hoosack. The _Cave_ or _Falls_,\r\n(O) is a singular chasm between limestone rocks. A small stream,\r\nwhich appears once to have run on the surface of the hollow between\r\ntwo small elevations, has now worn a passage many feet in depth\r\nthrough the limestone. The chasm is narrow, winding in its course\r\nseveral rods long, and its opposite sides were connected, till\r\nfour years ago, by a natural bridge of limestone. From the bridge\r\nto the water is 70 feet. There is a dark cavern of several feet\r\ndiameter, and some passages into the rocks. The white marble walls,\r\nthe foaming of the water below, the piles and irregularity of the\r\nrocks, and the thick overhanging trees, make the scene very wild\r\nand interesting. The limestone rests on mica slate. On the west\r\nbank of the Hoosack, and east base of the hill, (L) the same\r\ncoarse-grained and white limestone is found, resting on the mica\r\nslate at the west of it.\r\n\r\nAt the north and west base of Saddle Mountain, (E) and at a less\r\nelevation than the quartz, are extensive strata of limestone,\r\ninclining the same way as the mica slate of the mountain. It is\r\nless distinctly granular, and less white than the other, but\r\nbelongs to the same rock. It forms tolerably good marble. Between\r\nthe strata are crystals of carbonate of lime, rhomboidal, and\r\ntending to the _lenticular_ form. Some of these strata appear to be\r\ncomposed of blended crystals of this kind. In one place are strata\r\nof several rods in length and breadth, which are inclined to the\r\nsouthwest, and thus lie against the mica slate of the mountain.\r\nThe inclination is about forty-five degrees. Unless this limestone\r\nbe connected with that on the east of Saddle Mountain, (and no\r\nconnexion has yet been traced,) it must be considered as lying on\r\nboth sides of the mica slate, or alternating with it.\r\n\r\n5. _Argillaceous Slate_ rests on quartz on Stone Hill, and is\r\nalso found low down in the valley connected with limestone. It\r\nconstitutes the hill (P) connected with the Taconick range, and\r\nalso Northwest hill, (Q) whose base is compact limestone. A\r\nfew miles north, this slate is distinctly marked, and in about\r\n12 miles, forms hills of _roof slate_ in Hosack, New-York.\r\nIt is annually carried in large quantities to Albany. On the\r\nfirst-mentioned hill, it contains some _talc_.\r\n\r\n6. _Aluminous slate._ This is found in argillaceous slate, in\r\nPownal, 5 miles north, at the base of a hill east of the Hoosack.\r\nIt is used to _set_ colours.\r\n\r\n7. _Chlorite._ In rounded masses, generally with quartz, scattered\r\nthrough the valley in Williamstown, and found at an elevation of\r\nsome hundred feet on the hills of the Taconick range. Chlorite\r\nslate has already been mentioned as occurring on the same range.\r\n\r\n8. _Rubble Stone._ In rounded masses through the valley.\r\n\r\n9. _Compact Limestone._ In several places low in the valley. Near\r\nthe college it is white and deep gray. In the veins of the latter,\r\n_talc_ is diffused in all directions. It contains silex, often from\r\n3 to 15 per cent., and sometimes gives fire with steel. In some\r\ncases it is earthy. On Green River, one and a half mile south of\r\nthe college, it lies in thin strata, which are divided by seams\r\ninto very regular rhomboidal plates of various sizes. On some\r\nscattered fragments on this river, are found carbonate of lime in\r\ncrystals, with pieces of white feldspar. On West Brook, this gray\r\nlimestone is traversed by a vein of quartz, containing sulphuret\r\nof iron. The strata of this rock are almost invariably inclined\r\nto the east. A coarse _soapstone_ is found in the limestone near\r\nthe college, and a vein made up of brown argillaceous slate,\r\nsoapstone, quartz, and sulphuret of iron, passes through it. This\r\nlimestone appears to be very different from that at the base of\r\nSaddle Mountain, and from that which yields the marble of Berkshire\r\ncounty. It may still be _primitive_, but _primitive compact\r\nlimestone_.\r\n\r\n10. _Granitell_ of Kirwan, _Quartz_, and _Feldspar_. This aggregate\r\nforms extensive strata at the east base of Stone Hill. The\r\nfeldspar is diffused in grains through the quartz, and sometimes\r\ncrystalline, forming _porphyritic quartz_. This aggregate is often\r\ncompact and very hard, but frequently it is porous and hard,\r\nforming good millstones. Sometimes the quartz appears in such\r\nfragments, that the stone resembles _breccia_.\r\n\r\n11. _Black Tourmaline._ In beautiful small six-sided prisms, in\r\nscattered pieces of mica slate at the base of Stone Hill.\r\n\r\n12. _Amianthus._ Only a small specimen, attached to _argillaceous\r\nslate_.\r\n\r\n13. _Bitter Spar._ On compact limestone at West Brook. Some of the\r\ncrystals are rhomboids, and some appear to be the half of rhomboids\r\nsplit through their longer diagonal.\r\n\r\n14. _Jasper._ The common brown or red, and black, in small rounded\r\nmasses, and also a piece of variegated or striped jasper.\r\n\r\n15. _Galena._ Only a specimen in the limestone on West Brook.\r\n\r\n16. _Iron Ore._ _Bog ore_ on the Hoosack, a mile northeast of the\r\ncollege. _Yellow earth_, from which _yellow ochre_ is obtained in\r\ngreat quantity, in a hill (R) on the bank of Green River, 2 miles\r\nsouth of the college.\r\n\r\nAt the north end of Saddle Mountain, but low down, yellow earth\r\nis connected with _reddle_, or a substance much resembling it. It\r\nis less hard than the common reddle, but is composed of the same\r\ningredients.\r\n\r\n_Magnetic Oxyd of Iron_, regular octahedrons, in mica slate at the\r\nbase of Stone Hill.\r\n\r\n_Supersulphuret of Iron_, massive and crystallized, in argillaceous\r\nslate, mica slate, compact limestone, and quartz.\r\n\r\n17. _Prase._ Beautiful, and containing sulphuret of iron; lately\r\nfound by Mr. Eaton, a little east of the summit of Hoosack\r\nMountain, in Florida.\r\n\r\n18. _Puddingstone._ Where Pownal Mountain reaches the Hoosack, (T)\r\n3 miles north of the college, are some hills of this aggregate. It\r\nis composed of rounded masses of quartz, chlorite, and limestone,\r\nof various sizes, connected by an argillaceous cement.\r\n\r\n19. _Potters' Clay._ Excellent for vessels of common pottery.\r\n\r\nThe minerals of this section, it is obvious, are not very\r\nimportant; but as connected with a transverse section of the\r\ncountry, they possess considerable interest. For this reason they\r\nhave been particularly mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn the north part of Williamstown is a _mineral spring_, familiarly\r\ncalled the _Sand Spring_ (S.) The water rises from several places\r\nin a reservoir of about a rod in diameter, and from one to three\r\nfeet deep. It is very soft and warm, but contains very little\r\nsaline or earthy matter. Gas continually rises in it. It appears\r\nmuch to resemble the spring at New Lebanon, New-York, and has\r\nproved useful in the cure particularly of some _cutaneous_ diseases.\r\n\r\nThe _transverse section_, connected with the map, passes over\r\nStone Hill, and the north part of Saddle Mountain. The different\r\nrocks are shown in the section, directly below their places on\r\nthe map, by drawing lines from the several strata parallel to the\r\nsides of the map. This section is connected with that given by Mr.\r\nHitchcock, in the 2d number of this Journal. It ought perhaps to\r\nbe mentioned, that according to Mr. Eaton's account, the granite\r\nof this section sinks under gneiss to the east, and rises again\r\nin Hampshire County, \"supporting the same rock of gneiss;\" but\r\nwhere it reappears, the granite contains \"many imbedded minerals.\"\r\nThis section corresponds generally to the place and character of\r\nthe minerals in any section across Berkshire county. There are,\r\nhowever, some peculiarities which may be mentioned at a future\r\nday. The colouring corresponds to that on the geological map in\r\nCleaveland's Mineralogy.\r\n\r\n  C. DEWEY.\r\n\r\n_Williams' College, Jan. 27, 1819._\r\n\r\nP.S. I have a part of a _rock crystal_, which contains, in a\r\nhollow, a _liquid_ and a _little air_, and some _black_ or _brown\r\nparticles_, which just sink in the liquid. It was found several\r\nyears since at Diamond Hill in Catskill. This hill is only a\r\nsmall eminence on the bank of the creek at that place, composed\r\nof limestone, (if I have been correctly informed,) between the\r\nstrata of which, and on the side next the creek, this and other\r\nrock crystals were found. I believe, Sir, you have one like the\r\nabove, obtained from the same place. The crystal, which was\r\ngenerously given me by Mr. Van Loon, who found it, is only a part\r\nof two crystals connected at their bases. Partly under one of the\r\nsolid angles formed by the united pyramids, is the hollow, about\r\n⅝ inch long, about ⅜ filled with the air, and about ¼ inch wide.\r\nThe principal curiosity about it is the liquid. It has never been\r\nknown to _freeze_. It was exposed yesterday morning an hour to\r\nan atmosphere 4 and 5 degrees below zero. It became less fluid,\r\nfor the bubble of air moved with less ease and rapidity. Still\r\nthe liquid was fluid. Its colour, which is naturally white, had a\r\nslight tinge of yellow. The Rev. Mr. Schaeffer of New-York supposes\r\nthe black particles are bitumen. Is it possible the liquid is\r\n_naptha_? This oil is sometimes colourless, and does not congeal\r\nat zero, and that which I distilled from the Seneca oil, does\r\ncongeal at some degrees below zero. It can hardly be _salt water_,\r\nunless it be _very salt_, and even then, it would have congealed at\r\nthe temperature of the air yesterday. What way can be devised to\r\nascertain what it is?\r\n\r\n_Jan. 30, 1819._\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the notice of the crystals found at Hudson by Mr.\r\nSchaeffer, I wrote to a member of the Lyceum of Natural History,\r\nNew-York, rather more full an account than the above, of my\r\ncrystal, &c. I hope to ascertain, whether the liquid will congeal\r\nat 10 or 20° below 0, but have some fear lest the crystal should be\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\n  C. D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. IV. _On the Tourmalines and other Minerals found at\r\nChesterfield and Goshen, Massachusetts, by Col._ GEORGE GIBBS.\r\n\r\n(For the American Journal of Science.)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe schorl of the mineralogists of the last century united a\r\nvariety of substances which subsequent observations have separated\r\ninto several species. The green schorl is now the epidote, or the\r\nVesuvian, or the actynolite. The violet schorl, and the lenticular\r\nschorl, are the axinite. The black volcanic schorl is the augite.\r\nThe white Vesuvian schorl is the sommite. The white grenatiform\r\nis the leucite. The white prismatic is the pycnite, a species\r\nof the topaz, and another is a variety of feldspar. Of the blue\r\nschorl, one variety is the oxyd of titanium, another the sappare,\r\nand another the phosphate of iron. The schorl cruciform is the\r\ngranatite. The octahedral schorl is the octahedrite, or anatase.\r\nThe red schorl of Hungary, and the purple of Madagascar, are\r\nvarieties of the oxyd of titanium. The spathique schorl is the\r\nspodumen.\r\n\r\nThe black schorl, and the electric schorl, only remained, and to\r\navoid the confusion created by the use of the term schorl, the\r\nname of tourmaline was given to this species by that celebrated\r\nmineralogist, the Abbé Haüy.[50]\r\n\r\nThe tourmaline is found of almost every colour, and this variety\r\nof colour caused at first a number to be formed into new species;\r\nwhich are now considered only as varieties of the tourmaline: such\r\nas the rubellite, the tourmaline apyre, and indicolite.\r\n\r\nThe different analyses of the tourmaline, however, affords a\r\ngreater variety of results than is known in almost any other\r\nmineral.\r\n\r\n  The specific gravity of the black varies from 3.08 to 3.36\r\n                              Green        from 3.15 to 3.36\r\n                              Red          from 2.87 to 3.10\r\n\r\n  Analysis gives Silex from    35 to 58\r\n                 Alumine       20 to 48\r\n                 Magnesia       0 to 10\r\n                 Iron           0 to 23\r\n                 Manganese      0 to 13\r\n                 Alkali         0 to 10\r\n                 Water          0 to  4\r\n\r\nThese differences must be in some measure ascribed to a defect in\r\nthe accuracy of some of the analyses. But it appears that iron has\r\nnot been discovered in the red tourmaline. It is not unworthy of\r\nnotice, that the red tourmaline is considered as infusible, but the\r\nothers fusible.\r\n\r\nThe red tourmaline has been the most valued, from its scarcity,\r\nits employment in jewelry, and the beauty of its crystals. It has\r\nbeen discovered in Siberia, in Moravia, in the East-Indies, and\r\nin Massachusetts. In Siberia it is found in a vein of decomposed\r\nfeldspar in a fine-grained granite, with black tourmaline. In\r\nMoravia with quartz and lepidolite (or rose-coloured mica) in\r\ngneiss. In the East-Indies, at Ava and Ceylon, but its geological\r\nsituation is not known, though it is probably in gneiss or granite.\r\n\r\nThe red or rose tourmaline of Massachusetts, is found chiefly at\r\nChesterfield, in a subordinate bed of granite, contained in mica\r\nslate. The mica slate is the predominant rock of the country.\r\nIt is fine grained, and contains an abundance of small garnets.\r\nDirection of the strata north and south, varying a little easterly;\r\ninclination perpendicular. The bed of granite is about three\r\nhundred feet long, and from five to twenty feet broad. It is\r\ncontained in a narrow ridge of mica slate, which descends into,\r\nand is lost in, a valley. The sides are precipitous; the highest\r\npart is about forty feet high. On the east side a considerable part\r\nof the granite has been destroyed by natural causes, leaving the\r\ngranite bare. The granite consists chiefly of granular feldspar,\r\nwith grains of white quartz, and a little light coloured mica, is\r\nmoderately fine grained, and of a grayish white colour. In addition\r\nto tourmaline, it contains also emerald, some of the crystals of\r\nwhich are from three to five inches in diameter. I succeeded in\r\ngetting one out of its matrix, which is three and a half inches in\r\ndiameter, and its summit (which is a plane without any additional\r\nfacettes) is perfect.\r\n\r\nThe tourmalines are contained chiefly in a false vein of silicious\r\nfeldspar and quartz, which begins in the centre of the upper edge\r\nof the bed of granite, and passes obliquely, descending to the\r\nnortheast, about twenty feet, where it is intercepted from sight by\r\nthe mica slate. The vein is about one and a half foot thick in the\r\nupper part, and not more than six or eight inches where it is lost.\r\nThis vein of silicious feldspar contains also a vein of bluish\r\nwhite transparent quartz, which is from three to eight inches\r\nthick, and passes through the centre of the vein of feldspar.\r\n\r\nWhen I first examined this rock, soon after its discovery by\r\nDr. Hunt, of Northampton, I determined the feldspar to be a new\r\nvariety, which has been since confirmed by Professor Hauffman,\r\nand now ranks as a new sub-species, under the name of silicious\r\nfeldspar. (P. 41, of the Mineralogical Table.)\r\n\r\nThe analysis of Professor Stromeyer, of Gottingen, gives,\r\n\r\n  Silex                70.68\r\n  Alumine              19.80\r\n  Soda                  9.05\r\n  Iron, Mag. and Lime    .38\r\n                       -----\r\n                       99.91\r\n\r\nThe chief difference between this and the adularia is, that one\r\ncontains fourteen potash and the other nine soda. Between this and\r\nthe saussurite, or tenacious feldspar, the one contains eleven of\r\nlime, and the other only a trace.\r\n\r\nThe silicious feldspar, which I suspect to be the basis of the\r\ngranite, crystallizes in thin rhomboidal tables. They are very\r\nfrangible, and have one clivage perpendicular to the faces of\r\nthe tables. Sometimes the tables have one lateral edge or more\r\ntruncated. In one fragment of a crystal I observed a very obtuse\r\nacumination on the table, which appeared to be diedral, the sides\r\nbeing placed on the obtuse lateral edges of the tables. On account\r\nof the extreme frangibility of the crystals, it is certainly\r\nextremely difficult to seize their characters. Specific gravity\r\nonly 2.333, probably owing to interstices between the tables. The\r\ncolour is white, translucid, passing to semi-transparent; lustre\r\nsometimes dull, at others shining. The tables are sometimes so\r\naggregated that their edges being exposed, offer wedge-shaped and\r\nstelliform figures. The tourmalines are chiefly contained in this\r\nvein. They are red, or green, rarely blue or black.\r\n\r\nThe green tourmalines vary from one-eighth of an inch to one inch\r\nin diameter; they are sometimes four inches in length, and are\r\nentirely confined to the inner vein of quartz. They are triedral\r\nprisms, with convex faces, striated longitudinally, and generally\r\ntraversed perpendicularly to the axis, with very small fissures\r\nfilled by some silicious substance, probably feldspar. These green\r\ncrystals are opaque. The red tourmaline is frequently enclosed\r\nin the green. In certain parts of the vein almost every green\r\ncrystal encloses a red one, which always corresponds by its sides\r\nand angles with the exterior crystal. Sometimes a thin layer\r\nof talc intervenes between the outer and inner crystal. In one\r\nspecimen I found three crystals of the red aggregated together,\r\nand enclosed in one of the green. In another crystal I found\r\npyrites in the place of the red tourmaline. The largest crystal\r\nof the red was one quarter of an inch in diameter, and four\r\ninches long. The red tourmalines vary in intensity of colour, and\r\nfrequently (particularly in the interior) pass into violet. They\r\npass from translucid to semi-transparent. I have found some that\r\nwere terminated by triedral pyramids. The crystals are generally\r\nperpendicular to the sides of the vein. Small crystals of the red\r\noften run from the vein of quartz into the adjoining feldspar.\r\nThe granite also contains minute crystals of dark and light blue\r\ntourmaline, and pale green emerald, with a very few garnets and\r\npyrites. In the lower part of the vein, five to six feet from\r\nits interruption by the mica slate, the red tourmaline scarcely\r\nappears, and the vein contains chiefly bluish amorphous quartz and\r\ngreen tourmaline. It is therefore probable that this vein will not\r\nafford henceforward a great supply of this beautiful mineral.\r\n\r\nAbout six miles from Chesterfield, in Goshen, is found the rose\r\nmica, with tourmalines and emeralds interspersed in the granite.\r\nUnfortunately the bed of granite has not been discovered, and\r\nthe specimens we possess are taken from loose rocks, scattered\r\nover a small extent of ground in a valley, in the neighbourhood\r\nof mica slate. The rose mica is found in a large grained granite\r\nwith amorphous quartz and silicious feldspar, crystallized and\r\namorphous. The mica is generally of a rose red, sometimes yellowish\r\ngreen. It crystallizes in rhomboidal tables, rarely truncated on\r\nthe acute angles, passing into the hexaedral table. The tourmalines\r\nare light and dark green and blue, of various shades of intensity,\r\nfrequently acicular and stellated. The black, the red, and the\r\nviolet tourmalines also occur, but more rarely. Sometimes the\r\ngreen prisms enclose others of blue and black. Specific gravity\r\nof these varieties from 3. to 3.1. The green and blue crystals in\r\nthis locality are translucid or semi-transparent. The feldspar is\r\ngenerally white, rarely light blue. There are some emeralds in\r\nthe granite. Among some specimens which Mr. Weeks of New-York,\r\nwho discovered this locality, was so good as to give me, I found\r\na beautiful rose emerald in its matrix. It is a hexaedral prism,\r\nabout one and a quarter inch in diameter, the summit a plane, one\r\nof the lateral edges has a truncature. About half of the diameter\r\nof the prism is free from the matrix, and half an inch of the\r\nprism. The colour is a pale rose, rather more transparent than the\r\nemerald.\r\n\r\nThe colour of the mica of the Goshen granite calls to mind the\r\nlepidolite or lilalite, which (formerly considered as a distinct\r\nspecies) has now been united to mica. The lepidolite of Rosena is\r\nalso accompanied by the tourmaline apyre, now the red tourmaline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. V. _Observations on the Minerals connected with the Gneiss\r\nrange of Litchfield county, by Mr._ JOHN P. BRACE, _of Litchfield,\r\nConn._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gneiss formation is the most extensive of any in Litchfield\r\ncounty, and embraces a number of very interesting minerals. It\r\nextends east into Hartford county. On the north it runs into\r\nMassachusetts, though frequently interrupted by the limestone\r\nformation, which rests upon it. It forms the principal, and in many\r\ncases the only rock of the eastern and northeastern sections of the\r\ncounty, and of the towns of Litchfield, Goshen, Warren, Cornwall,\r\nand Norfolk. In Washington and Canaan, it constitutes the rock of\r\nthe high mountains, and is a part of the same range in the other\r\ntowns, while the valleys and the more moderate elevations are\r\ncovered with limestone.\r\n\r\nThe river Housatonic appears to have made its way through this\r\nrange, for the same rock continues on the western side of the river\r\nparallel to it in the mountains of Kent, Sharon, and Salisbury.\r\nIn Litchfield commences a range of porphyritic granite, or\r\n_porphyritic gneiss_, which alternates with the common gneiss,\r\nand in some instances rests upon it. This rock begins at Mount\r\nProspect, between Litchfield and Warren, and runs through South\r\nFarms, Bethlem, and Watertown. The crystals of feldspar in it, are\r\noften very perfect.\r\n\r\nThe primitive granite, as a rock, is not found, though it lies\r\nscattered on the surface in great quantities, and large masses. The\r\ngraphic granite in this region is often remarkably fine. Mica slate\r\nconstitutes a considerable part of those rocks that rest on the\r\ngneiss, though never found in such elevated situations. The mica\r\nslate rocks are always inclined at a great angle with the horizon,\r\nand follow the direction of the other range. Litchfield village,\r\nChesnut hill, and great part of Harwington, are entirely composed\r\nof this rock. The Bantum and the Waterbury rivers have their\r\nbottoms of it. Some of the brooks entering the Waterbury, have\r\ncut their passage through the mica slate, leaving walls of 40 or\r\n50 feet on each side, traversed by veins of a very coarse-grained\r\ngranite, and often much mixed with sulphuret of iron. The slate\r\nnear Harwington meeting-house contains a great quantity of\r\nsulphuret of iron. Mica slate likewise lies on the sides of the\r\ngneiss range in Canaan and Salisbury, where it dips under the\r\nlimestone. _Sienite_ is scattered on the surface in large masses,\r\nespecially where the porphyritic gneiss is found. Sometimes,\r\nhowever, the masses are so large as to form mountains. Mount\r\nTom, between Litchfield and Washington, is of this nature, being\r\nentirely composed of sienite, resting on gneiss. Slaty sienite is\r\nfrequently found, having a very large proportion of hornblende.\r\n\r\nThe minerals that are found in this region, are much more\r\ninteresting than its geology. In describing them, I shall confine\r\nmyself to the district east of the limestone range, intending at\r\nsome future time to investigate and describe the limestone country.\r\n\r\nCarbonate of lime, the granular limestone, is scattered over the\r\nwhole of this region. It often is found in the cavities of decayed\r\nquartz rocks, and contains tremolite and augite.\r\n\r\n_Cyanite_ or _Sappar_, is found in great quantities, especially in\r\nHarwington and Litchfield. A crystalline mass of this was found a\r\nfew years ago, weighing probably 15 cwt.; it lay on a mica slate\r\nridge, and undoubtedly had been formerly imbedded in the slate.\r\nBeautiful white talc, and small crystals of sulphuret of iron, are\r\ndisseminated in the mass. Specimens of this mass are in almost all\r\nthe cabinets in America. Smaller masses have been found associated\r\nwith feldspar. Small crystals of this mineral are very common in\r\nmica slate, with staurotide and garnet. Two of these crystals are\r\noften arranged at right angles with each other. In Cornwall it is\r\nfound in small crystals in the gneiss containing graphite.\r\n\r\n_Staurotide_ is very common and very beautiful. It is found\r\nprincipally in mica slate, and exhibits often the cross. It most\r\ngenerally is crystallized in four-sided prisms.\r\n\r\n_Quartz_, of course, is common. Cornwall particularly is\r\ndistinguished for the _smoky_ variety. Ferruginous quartz is found\r\nin rolled masses in the whole of this range.\r\n\r\n_Petro silex_, in rolled masses with ferruginous quartz, containing\r\nveins of _chalcedony_ and _hornstone_, and geodes of quartz\r\ncrystals, are common in Litchfield and Goshen. Sometimes these\r\nmasses in the interior assume the appearance of Burrstone.\r\n\r\n_Common opal_ has been found in Litchfield, though rarely. It was\r\npart of a mass of ferruginous quartz, with indelible dendritic\r\nimpression. It is very hard, and its fracture is conchoidal.\r\n\r\n_Mica_ is very common. It is found green, white, and perfectly\r\nblack. It generally occurs in blocks of granite.\r\n\r\n_Schorl_, in rounded crystals, is found in all the granite in this\r\nrange; in radiating crystals on quartz; and in acicular crystals on\r\nmica slate. The large crystals are so brittle, that few of them can\r\nbe obtained perfect. I once found it in Litchfield, near Plymouth,\r\nin prismatic crystals on earthy graphite.\r\n\r\nFeldspar is very common and beautiful in all the towns. It is\r\nusually found in rhomboidal fragments, and has a fine lustre. It is\r\nblue, white, and red. Some of the granite of Torringford is very\r\nbeautiful, being composed of white and smoky quartz, red feldspar,\r\nand green mica. In the porphyritic gneiss, feldspar is in six-sided\r\nprisms. One small crystal of adularia, well defined, has been found\r\nby E. Wilkins, Esq.\r\n\r\n_Beryl_, both crystallized and massive, is often found in\r\nLitchfield in granite. Its colours are green, greenish yellow, pale\r\nyellow, and brown. Its crystals are often very perfect.\r\n\r\n_Garnets_ are common in all the towns of this range.\r\n\r\n_Epidote._ Very beautiful crystals of this mineral have been found\r\nin Washington, associated with feldspar. They are so rounded as to\r\nrender it very difficult to discover their form. They have a very\r\nfine lustre, and are of an olive green; in Litchfield, in crystals\r\nwith hornblende, and graphic granite, and in veins in sienite.\r\n\r\nPerhaps no region can be found containing more beautiful\r\n_tremolite_. All its varieties occur; the fibrous of Litchfield and\r\nBethlem is very distinguished. In Canaan, it is found containing\r\ncrystals of sulphuret of iron. I do not speak here of the tremolite\r\nfound in the limestone range.\r\n\r\n_Common asbestus_ exists in Washington and New Milford.\r\n\r\nThe white _augite_ is a mineral found in this range; in Litchfield,\r\nin six-sided prisms very much flattened, on quartz, and carbonate\r\nof lime with tremolite. They sometimes occur several inches long.\r\n\r\nThe _lamellar_ and _slaty_ varieties of common _hornblende_ are\r\nvery common.\r\n\r\nRadiated _actynolite_ of a beautiful bluish green in Litchfield; in\r\nCanton of a brownish green.\r\n\r\n_Steatite_ is common, and is quarried in Litchfield. The varieties\r\nof _talc_ are very common, connected with steatite, cyanite, and\r\nchlorite.\r\n\r\n_Chlorite_ in Litchfield, is found on quartz, with talc.\r\n\r\nPorcelain clay in Litchfield in small quantities, and in Washington.\r\n\r\n_Graphite_ is found in Cornwall in great quantities. Its gangue is\r\ngneiss and sienite. It is lamellar, and has a metallic lustre; is\r\neasily obtained, and might be made useful. Epidote and cyanite are\r\nfound with it.\r\n\r\n_Ores_ are not common. Oxides of iron, and sulphuret of iron are\r\nscattered over the whole range. Near Mount Prospect in Litchfield,\r\nsulphuret of iron in mass is in great quantities; and sulphate of\r\niron on the surface of the ground near it. A stone containing a few\r\ngrains of _native copper_ was found in Litchfield.\r\n\r\nThe red oxyde of _titanium_ occurs in Litchfield sparingly. A very\r\nhandsome specimen of the _reticulated oxyde of titanium_, was\r\npicked up. It was on mica, and the mica had an evident tendency\r\ntowards the same form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTANY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. VI. _An Account of two North American Species of Rottböllia,\r\ndiscovered on the Sea-coast in the State of Georgia, by Dr._\r\nWILLIAM BALDWIN, _of Philadelphia_.\r\n\r\n_Flowers in pairs, or two from each joint of the rachis, one\r\nneutral. The neutral, or imperfect flowers, pedicillate._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rottböllia corrugata._\r\n\r\nCulmo erecto, compresso, sulcato, glabro, ramoso: foliis\r\nlongis angustisque: spicis sub-compressis, nudis super uno\r\nlatere, solitariis et terminalibus, supremis approximatis:\r\ncalycis bivalvis, valva exteriori transversè _corrugata_ et\r\nlongitudinaliter rugosa: corolla trivalvis.\r\n\r\nCulm erect, compressed, sulcate, smooth, ramose: leaves long and\r\nnarrow: spikes slightly compressed, naked on one side, solitary\r\nand terminal, approximating towards the summit: calyx 2-valved,\r\nthe exterior valve transversely _corrugate_, and longitudinally\r\nwrinkled: corolla 3-valved. _Vid._ _Nuttall's North American\r\nGenera_, v. I. p. 84.[51]\r\n\r\n_Culm_ two to three feet high, with a very solid exterior, but\r\n_spongy_ within, compressed, and deeply grooved on its inner angle\r\nthe whole length between the joints. _Leaves_ long, narrow, and\r\nacute, scabrous on the margin and midrib. _Sheaths_ compressed,\r\ncorresponding with the culm, shorter than the internodes, open,\r\nwith membraneous margins. _Peduncles_ short, clothed with a thin\r\nmembraneous acute pointed sheath, which generally encloses also\r\nthe base of the spike. _Spikes_ two to three inches long. The\r\nflowers are arranged in alternate order, but occupy only one side\r\nof the rachis, as in the _R. dimidiata_. The neutral florets, or\r\n_clavate_ pedicels, are joined _laterally_ to the perfect flowers.\r\nArticulations of the rachis remarkably tumid, attenuated beneath,\r\nflat on the interior side, exteriorly convex, scabrous, and\r\nlongitudinally striate. The exterior valve of the calyx, in the\r\nperfect flowers, is ovate, obtuse, very thick, cartilaginous, the\r\ninner margin inflected, and deeply marked on its outer surface with\r\nfrom three to five _corrugations_, with longitudinal ridges between\r\nthem; the interior valve is smaller, of equal length, acute, ruled,\r\ncoriaceous, smooth, and with the inner margin also inflected. The\r\nvalves of the corolla are membraneous, ovate, acute, white, shorter\r\nthan the calyx, the exterior one the longest. The neutral florets\r\nare sometimes male, but most commonly consist of nothing more than\r\na 2-valved calyx, the valves equal, gaping, scabrous, and much\r\nsmaller than those of the perfect flower. _Stamens_ 3, very short.\r\n_Anthers_ twin, yellow. _Styles_ 2, rather longer than the stamens.\r\n_Stigmas_ small, plumose, dark purple.\r\n\r\n_Discovered_ between St. Mary's and Jefferson, in Camden county,\r\nGeorgia, on the 13th of July, 1813. _Inhabits_ flat, moist pine\r\nbarren. I have not seen it \"on the sea-coast of Florida.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that my description of this plant differs\r\n_materially_ from that of _Mr. Nuttall_. This has unavoidably\r\narisen from _my_ having attended to it in its living state, and\r\nfrom _his_ not availing himself of the information which it would\r\nhave afforded me pleasure to have communicated, had he done me\r\nthe favour to have requested it, or informed me of his wish to\r\npublish an account of plants thus obtained. He has called the culm\r\n_solid_, leaves _rather short_, spikes _cylindric_, _axillary_, the\r\nflowers and rachis _entirely smooth_, pedicel of the neutral flower\r\n_emarginate_, outer valve of the hermaphrodite calyx _acute_, the\r\nvalves of the corolla _obtuse_, and the styles _very short_. I have\r\nnot been able to confirm the above _characters_, nor do I find them\r\neven in the dried specimens. Besides, he has omitted to inform us\r\nthat the rachis is _naked on one side_. This is a most important\r\nand prominent _specific character_, the omission of which would\r\nnecessarily lead to much doubt in identifying the species. What\r\nhe means by stating that the \"outer valve of the hermaphrodite\r\nflower is 3-valved,\" I cannot imagine, nor do I comprehend what\r\nis intended by an \"exterior auxiliary valve, or neutral rudiment;\r\nnearly the length of the calyx.\" I have noticed in a single\r\ninstance, connected _laterally_ with the corolla of the perfect\r\nflower, two very delicate, narrow, acute pointed bodies, the length\r\nof the outer valve, and of the same quality and appearance; but\r\nthese I have considered as accidental, and cannot perceive any\r\nthing about them like _neutral rudiments_. Nor can I consider the\r\narticulations of the rachis as \"deeply excavated.\" They are, as\r\nalready stated, flat on the inner side, and constitute from their\r\n_flexuous_ form, position, and connexion with the pedicels of the\r\nneutral florets, an arch, in which the perfect flowers are situated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rottböllia ciliata._[52]\r\n\r\nCulmo erecto, tereti, glabro, ramoso: foliis angustissimis,\r\nbrevibus: spicis cylindricis super pedunculis teretibus longis,\r\nsolitariis terminalibusquæ: calycis bivalvis, margine valva\r\nexteriori _ciliata_: corolla bivalvis.\r\n\r\nCulm erect, terete, smooth, ramose: leaves very narrow, short:\r\nspikes cylindrical upon long terete peduncles, solitary and\r\nterminal, calyx 2-valved, the margin of the exterior valve\r\n_ciliate_: corolla 2-valved.\r\n\r\n_Root_ perennial. _Culm_ two to four feet high, _generally_\r\nramose, solid, and terete, except that between the joints where\r\nthe branches originate, it is grooved on the inner side, and often\r\nciliate on its angles near the joints. The branches originate\r\ntowards the extremity, commonly from two to three in number,\r\neach supporting a single terminal spike. _Leaves_ very narrow,\r\nacute, comparatively short, those beneath much the longest,\r\nrigid, somewhat involute, and sharply serrulate towards the apex.\r\n_Sheaths_ rather shorter than the _internodes_, open to the base,\r\nbut closely embracing the culm. _Spikes_ 3 to 5 inches long, the\r\npeduncles clothed with a very delicate acute pointed sheath, which\r\nembraces it so closely as almost to elude observation, varying\r\nmuch in length, but seldom extending to the base of the spike.\r\nPeduncles scabrous near the spike. _Flowers_ alternate, the _male_\r\nor neutral florets situated on one side of the rachis. _Rachis_\r\ncompressed, slender, flexuous, hairy on its exterior surface.\r\nPedicel of the neutral florets also compressed, and hairy on its\r\nexterior surface. _Valves_ of the calyx _nearly_ equal, lanceolate,\r\nacute, coriaceous, polished, the inner margin of each inflected.\r\nThe exterior margin of the outer valve finely _ciliate_ towards\r\nthe apex. _Valves_ of the corolla lanceolate, acute, membraneous,\r\nnearly the length of the calyx. The male or neutral, are rather\r\nsmaller than the hermaphrodite flowers. _Stamens_ 3, very short.\r\n_Anthers_ twin, purple. Styles 2, excerted, plumose, dark brown.\r\n\r\nDiscovered in flat pine barren on the north side of Satilla river,\r\nin Georgia, on the 21st of October, 1815.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\nThese plants are unquestionably allied to _andropogon_ in their\r\nmode of flowering, but have nevertheless sufficient _essential\r\ncharacters_ to distinguish them. In _habit_, they appear but\r\nslightly similar. They differ _principally_ from their congeners\r\nin the pedicellate character of their neutral florets. _The spikes\r\nare not axillary in either of them._ The branches are _axillary_,\r\nof which several sometimes originate from the same axil in the\r\n_R. corrugata_. Each spike, when fully evolved, is not only\r\n_pedicellate_, but the _pedicel_, or peduncle, is connected with\r\na _culm_ containing one, two, or more joints.[53] The culm is not\r\ncompressed, nor the leaves long in the _R. ciliata_, as stated by\r\n_Mr. Nuttall_, who appears to have confounded the two species in\r\nthese, and some other instances. The joints of the rachis in both\r\nare _fragile_, the joints of the culm in neither.\r\n\r\nAnother species noticed by Michaux, and included in all our books\r\nas the _R. dimidiata, L._ has long been familiar to the southern\r\nbotanists. Whether this be the _dimidiata_ found also on the\r\nsandy shores of India, or the _compressa_ of the same country, as\r\nsuggested by _Mr. Elliott_, or a species distinct from either, I\r\nam not prepared to determine. But I have collected this plant in\r\nthe Bermudian Isles, at Rio de Janeiro, and Bahia, on the Brazilian\r\ncoast, and lastly on the island of Flores, near one hundred miles\r\nfrom the mouth of the Rio de la Plata, as well as on the main in\r\nthe Banda Oriental.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. VII. _Floral Calendar kept at Deerfield, Massachusetts, with\r\nMiscellaneous Remarks, by Dr._ STEPHEN W. WILLIAMS, _of Deerfield._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _To Professor Silliman._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\nAny thing which has a tendency to elicit facts with regard to\r\nthe climate of a country must be interesting. I believe that\r\nobservations upon the time of the germination, foliation,\r\nflorification, and fructification of plants, afford a much more\r\ncorrect criterion respecting climate than thermometrical, or other\r\nmeteorological journals. They should be made at the same time in\r\nvarious parts of the country, and for several years in succession.\r\nI send you a Calendarium Floræ, with miscellaneous remarks, made in\r\nDeerfield, Massachusetts, during a part of the years 1811, 1812,\r\nand 1818, which, if you please, you may insert in your valuable\r\nJournal.

Early garden peas sown.\r\n\r\n  19. Dandelion (_Leon. tarax._) in full flower. Blue or meadow\r\n  violet (_V. cucullata_) in flower. Leaves of the lilac beginning\r\n  to expand. Our farmers busily engaged in ploughing for sowing.\r\n\r\n  23. Peas and oats sown, and Indian corn planted.\r\n\r\n  25. Swallows arrived, and whippoorwills begin to sing.\r\n\r\n  27.

Nature seems to revive from a\r\nstate of torpidity, from the warm and invigorating rays of the\r\nsun. The month of May has been more backward than the month of\r\nApril, 1811. The observation of elderly people, that the month of\r\nApril, old style, was never known to terminate without producing\r\napple-blossoms, has by no means been verified this year, they being\r\nnow (June 1st.) in full flower. The snow upon the mountains, thirty\r\nor forty miles back, is at a great depth; so deep, that on the warm\r\nday of the 29th our river rose a foot from its melting. Diseases of\r\nthe chronic kind have been peculiarly severe for three months past.\r\nThe gladsome return of the cheering warmth will probably renovate\r\nthe enfeebled constitutions of many of our aged people.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _June_ 1. House flies arrived.\r\n\r\n  5. Choke cherry (_Prun. serotin._) in full flower. Honeysuckle\r\n  apple (_Azalea nudiflora_) in full flower.\r\n\r\n  8. Piony in full flower.

Early corn tasseled (_Zea mays._ Variety _præcox._) Red\r\n  raspberries fully ripe.\r\n\r\n  22. Whortleberries ripe (_Vaccin. resinos._)\r\n\r\n  24. Cucumbers fit for the table.\r\n\r\n  28. Early potatoes fit for the table.\r\n\r\n  29. Rye fit for the sickle. Early garden squashes (_Cucurbita\r\n  Melo-pepo_) fit for the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _August_ 2. Jenneting apples ripening.\r\n\r\n  5. Early corn fit for the table.\r\n\r\n  8. Wheat (_Triticum hyburnum_) fit for the sickle.\r\n\r\n  28. Summer peas ripening.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _September_ 4. Watermelons and muskmelons ripe.\r\n\r\n  5. Swallows departed.\r\n\r\n  6. Elderberries fully ripe.\r\n\r\n  11. Choke cherries and wild cherries (_Prunus virginiana_) ripe.\r\n\r\n  12. Yellow plum (_Prunus chicasa_) fully ripe.\r\n\r\n  15. Butternut beginning to fall from the tree.\r\n\r\n  16. Our farmers making their first cider.\r\n\r\n  22. Great grapes ripe.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _October_ 2. Butternut and elm beginning to defoliate.\r\n  Chestnut-burrs beginning to open.\r\n\r\n  9. Our farmers beginning to harvest their Indian corn.\r\n\r\n\r\n1818.\r\n\r\n  _March_ 11. Bluebirds arrived.\r\n\r\n  13. Woodpeckers, robins, and blackbirds arrived. Bees out of the\r\n  hive.\r\n\r\n  _March_ 14. Broad-leaved panic grass (_Panicum latifolium_)\r\n  beginning to sprout on a southern exposure, while there is\r\n  sleighing in the street. A solitary spathe of skunk-cabbage\r\n  (_Pothos fœtida_) beginning to show itself on the same exposure.\r\n  Leaves of curled dock (_Rumex crispa_) appeared in the same\r\n  place. Maple-trees tapped for sugar.\r\n\r\n  16. _Pothos fœtida_ in full flower.\r\n\r\n  25. Black ducks arrived. Catkins of the poplar-tree (_Populus\r\n  tremuloides_) expanded. Catkins of the speckled willow (_Salix\r\n  Muhlenbergiana_) expanded.\r\n\r\n  30. Wild geese arrived. Phœbe arrived.\r\n\r\nIt began to rain hard on the first of March, and continued raining\r\ntwo days and a half, which nearly carried off an immense body of\r\nsnow which enveloped the ground. Our rivers, which were more firmly\r\nlocked with ice than they had been before known for many years to\r\nbe, rose above their usual bounds, and swept the ice with such\r\nrapidity down their channels as to destroy most of the bridges on\r\nConnecticut river, besides doing immense damage in other respects.\r\nOur meadows were nearly all under ice and water; and at that time\r\na great explosion was heard in the north meadows, two miles from\r\nthe street, similar to the noise of a cannon. It was occasioned by\r\nthe throwing up of an immense quantity of frozen ground, which is a\r\ngreat curiosity. The cause is not yet satisfactorily explained. The\r\nweather was very warm and pleasant from the 4th to the 22d. What\r\nsnow the rain did not carry off was melted by the sun during the\r\npleasant weather. Vegetation had begun to put forth rapidly, and\r\nmany of our birds of passage had arrived. A storm, which commenced\r\non the 22d, as rapidly retarded the progress of vegetation as it\r\nwas before accelerated, and the remainder of the month was gloomy\r\nand uncomfortable. Mud mid-leg deep in the streets.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _April_ 7. Flower-buds of the elm (_Ulmus americana_) beginning\r\n  to swell.\r\n\r\n  _April_ 8. Leaf-buds of the lilac (_Syring. vulg._) beginning to\r\n  swell.\r\n\r\n  10. Leaf-buds of the soft or meadow maple (_Acer rubrum_)\r\n  beginning to swell. Black alder (_Alnus serrulata_) in flower.\r\n  American hazel (_Corylus americana_) in flower, and its catkins\r\n  appearing.\r\n\r\n  11. Fair and pleasant, after a long storm. It has rained sixteen\r\n  days in succession. Frogs begin to sing. Leaf-buds of the English\r\n  cherry (_Prunus cerasus_) black heart beginning to swell. Garden\r\n  peas sown.\r\n\r\n  12. Flies in myriads arrived in our streets. Catkins of the\r\n  butternut (_Juglans cinerea_) beginning to swell. Saxifrage\r\n  (_Saxifraga virginiensis_) in flower.\r\n\r\n  13. Skylarks arrived.\r\n\r\n  14. Sweet fern (_Comptonia asplenifolia_) in flower. White birch\r\n  (_Betula populifolia_) in flower.\r\n\r\n  16. Our farmers beginning to plough for spring wheat.\r\n\r\n  18. Bank swallows arrived.\r\n\r\n  19. Leaf-buds of the currant, the gooseberry, and the apple,\r\n  considerably swoln.\r\n\r\n  20. Dandelion (_Leon. tarax._) beginning to flower. _Viola\r\n  cucullata_ beginning to blossom.\r\n\r\n  22. Our farmers ploughing for peas and oats. The snow upon the\r\n  hills 20 miles north and west from Deerfield is two feet and a\r\n  half deep, and the winds from those quarters are so chilly as to\r\n  retard the progress of vegetation. Icicles scarcely melted upon\r\n  the south side of buildings in Halifax, Vermont; and it is too\r\n  cold for making sugar.\r\n\r\n  25. Blood-root (_Sanguinaria canadensis_) in flower on a warm\r\n  south side hill. Leaves of the English gooseberry beginning\r\n  to expand. Venus's pride (_Houstonia cœrulea_) in flower.\r\n  Early life-everlasting, (_Gnaphalium plantagineum_) crowfoot,\r\n  (_Ranunculus fascicularis_) tooth-root, (_Dentaria laciniata_)\r\n  and meadow-rue (_Thalictrum cornutum_) in full flower.\r\n\r\n  26.

Lilac in full flower.\r\n\r\nThe weather till the last week in May was very cold and rainy.\r\nPerhaps we have never known more gloomy weather than that of the\r\nfirst twenty days of the month. The last week in the month of May\r\nwas unusually warm and fine. Vegetation has put forth more within\r\nthis week than it has in all the season before. The blossoms on\r\napple-trees are scanty, and there is but little prospect of fruit.\r\nPeach-trees in the vicinity of this place were all killed by the\r\nextreme cold winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _June_ 1.

Locust-tree (_Robinia pseudacacia_) in full flower.\r\n\r\n  15. Locusts appearing in the south part of the town. The last\r\n  time of their appearance here was in the year 1801. Their\r\n  periodical returns are once in seventeen years. Their appearance\r\n  in the years 1733, 1750, 1767, 1784, and 1801, is recorded on\r\n  the town-book. They first attack the leaves of the black oak\r\n  (_Quercus nigra_.)\r\n\r\n  16. Small red rose in flower.\r\n\r\n  17. _Rosa caroliniensis_ in full flower.\r\n\r\n  18.

M. 100°.\r\n\r\nVegetation has put forth and increased with a more astonishing\r\nrapidity this month than has ever been known. Notwithstanding the\r\nspring was very backward, the season now is forward. Our farmers\r\ncommenced their first haying about a week earlier than they did\r\nlast year.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _July_ 1.

Jan. 25, 1819._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. VIII. _Description and Natural Classification of the Genus\r\nFloerkea, by_ C. S. RAFINESQUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis genus was discovered in Pennsylvania, near Lancaster, by the\r\nRev. Dr. Muhlenberg, who communicated the same to Wildenow of\r\nBerlin. This celebrated botanist ascertained that it was a new\r\ngenus, to which he gave the name of a German botanist, (Floerke)\r\nand published it in the third volume of the transactions of the\r\nsociety _des Curieux de la Nature_ of Berlin, for 1801, under\r\nthe name of _Floerkea proserpinacoides_, which long and uncouth\r\nspecific name has been changed by every subsequent author. Michaux\r\nhas omitted it altogether, (with many more American species) in\r\nhis _Flora Boreali Americana_, published in 1803. Persoon calls\r\nit _Floerkea lacustris_, in Syn. plant. 1. p. 393. Muhlenberg\r\n_Floerkea uliginosa_, in Cat. pl. Amer. Sept. p. 36. and Pursh, in\r\nFlora Amer. Sept. 1. p. 239, unites it with the genus _Nectris_,\r\nand calls it _Nectris pinnata_, putting it therefore in the\r\nHexandria digynia of Linnæus, while all the preceding authors had\r\nclassed it in the Hexandria monogynia. I will show presently which\r\namong them appear to be wrong; but I must notice before, that no\r\nbotanist had, I believe, endeavoured to class it naturally, until\r\nMr. Correa de Serra, who in his _reduction of American genera to\r\nthe natural families of Jussieu_, attempted, without having had\r\nan opportunity to see the plant, to place it in the family of\r\n_Junci_, taking it therefore to be a monocotyle plant; being led\r\ninto this error by a mistaken idea, that all hexandrous plants must\r\nbe monocotyle! But in the spring of 1816, I found this plant in the\r\nneighbourhood of Philadelphia, (near the falls of the Schuylkill)\r\nwhere it had escaped the attention of all the botanists of that\r\ncity, and in particular of Dr. William Barton, who has therefore\r\nomitted it in his Prodr. fl. Philad. and having communicated it to\r\nMr. Correa, he acknowledged that it was dicotyle, of which fact I\r\nwas aware, even before seeing the plant and dissecting its seed, by\r\nattending to its habit.\r\n\r\nThe following exact description of this genus will enable the\r\nreader to ascertain how far I am correct in my presumptions towards\r\nits natural arrangement.\r\n\r\n_Floerkea._ Perigone double persistent, sixpartite; the exterior\r\ncalicinal 3 partile, sepals acute; the interior shorter, coloured\r\n3 partile, sepals petaloid, oblong, obtuse. Six stamens perigyne,\r\nfilaments filiform, of the length of the interior sepals, anthers\r\nround. One free ovarium, rounded and bilobed, one central and\r\nbifod style, two capitated stigmas. Fruit a bilobed atricule,\r\ntuberculated and bilocular dispermous, sometimes round, unilocular\r\nand monospermous by abortion of one lobe and cell. Seeds attached\r\nto the centre near the bottom, nearly lenticular, smooth\r\nalbuminous, easily divided in two lobes. _Habit._ Small, delicate,\r\nannual, and glabrous plant, with alternate polytome pinnated\r\nleaves, flowers axillar, solitary, pedunculated.\r\n\r\n_Floerkea uliginosa._ Caule tenello flaccido erecto simplex, foliis\r\n4 petiolatis imis ternatis, summis pinnato, quinatis, pinnulis\r\nlineari oblongis obtusis, integris floribus axillaris, solitaris\r\npedunculis longis apice incrastatis. Stem delicate, soft, upright,\r\nand simple, leaves petiolated, the inferior ternated, the superior\r\npinnated, quinate, pinnules linear-oblong obtuse, flowers axillar,\r\nsolitary, and on long peduncles, swelled under the flower.\r\n\r\nAmong the several specific names given to this plant, I prefer\r\nMuhlenberg's, as it expresses exactly the kind of situations\r\nwhere it grows, say in moist grounds, occasionally swampish or\r\noverflowed; those I found near Philadelphia, grew by thousands on\r\nthe banks of a small brook in a wood below the left side of the\r\nfalls of Schuylkill. Persoon's name of _lacustris_, being wrong, as\r\nit would seem to imply that it grows in lakes only; and Wildenow's\r\nname being too long and illusive, its similarity of habit with the\r\ngenus _Proserpinaca_ not being very striking. However, even the\r\nname of _uliginosa_ is liable to some slight objection; and did I\r\nthink myself permitted to coin a new name, while so many have been\r\nproposed already, I should have called it either _F. tenella_, or\r\n_F. flaccida_, or _F. olitoria_, being a very delicate and tender\r\nplant, and very good to eat in sallad, as I have tried it myself,\r\nits taste is sweet and pleasant, the whole plant may be eaten,\r\n(even the root) being all juicy and tender: it grows in such an\r\nabundance in some spots, that it might occasionally afford a most\r\nprecious and delightful sallad, but if cultivated for that purpose,\r\nit might be found an agreeable addition to our culinary herbs.\r\n\r\nIn addition to my above definition, it will be proper to state that\r\nthe stem of this plant rises from 4 to 8 inches, it is cylindrical,\r\nsmooth, and yellowish, the middle leaves are the largest, the lower\r\npeduncles are longer than the leaves, and the upper ones shorter,\r\nthe petals or interior sepals, and the stamens are yellow. It\r\nblossoms in May, and is annual, it even lasts only three months.\r\n\r\nIt will be perceived that I do not agree with Mr. Pursh, in\r\nuniting this plant with the genus _Nectris_: he owns himself that\r\nit deviates a _little_ from the generic character of _Nectris_,\r\nbut these deviations appear to me very material; they exist in\r\nthe pistils and fruits, the most essential parts of the flowers,\r\nsince they agree in the perigone and stamens. The genus _Nectris_\r\n(or _Calomba_ of Aublet) has _two ovaries_, _two styles_, and\r\n_two polispermous capsules_, or _achens_! and belongs therefore\r\nto the second order _Perimesia_, (class _Eltrogynia_) eighth\r\nfamily _Achenopsia_ next to the genus _Myriophyllum_: while the\r\ngenus Floerkea which has a _bilobed ovary_, _one central style_,\r\n_two stigmas_, and _one bilocular dispermous achen_, must belong\r\nto the eleventh order of the same class; _Isostimia_, which is\r\ncharacterized by having more than one stigma, the stamens in\r\nregular number, and not central; it will form a connecting link\r\nbetween this order and the foregoing _Polymesia_, by its affinity\r\nwith many genera of the _Euphorbia's_ tribe, such as _Callitriche_,\r\n_Tragia_, _Mercurialis_, &c. from which it differs merely by having\r\nhermaphrodite flowers, and perispheric regular stamens. It will at\r\npresent stand nearly isolated in this order, where it may form the\r\nsmall family _Galenidia_, along with the genus _Galenia_, &c. and\r\nwhich shall have much affinity with the family _Phytolacia_; but\r\nthis differs by having a multilocular berry, while the _Galenia_\r\nmerely differs by having a 4 sided perigone, 8 stamens, and 2\r\nstyles.\r\n\r\nI admit, however, that there is a strong affinity between the\r\ngenera _Floerkea_ and _Nectris_, but stronger affinities often\r\nexist in plants of different classes. If, however, it should happen\r\nthat Aublet[54] might have been mistaken in describing the ovaries\r\nand capsules of the _Nectris_ as double, if they should prove to\r\nbe simple but bilobed, then the _Nectris_ would belong to the\r\nsame family as the _Floerkea_; but yet stand as a peculiar genus\r\ndistinguished by having 2 styles, and the achens not monospermous!\r\n\r\nIt was insinuated to me by Mr. Correa, that the _Floerkea_ might\r\nhave some affinity with the tribe of _Ranunculaceous_, but I cannot\r\ndiscover any, since that tribe is widely different, by having many\r\novaries, stamens, and fruits, each ovary with 1 style or stigma,\r\na deciduous perigone, the anthers adnate, &c. The analogy in the\r\nstructure of the seed and habit, is too slight to be taken in\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. IX. _Descriptions of Three New Genera of Plants, from the\r\nState of New-York. Cylactis, Nemopanthus, and Polanisia, by_ C. S.\r\nRAFINESQUE.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _N. G. Cylactis._\r\n\r\nCalyx campanulated 6 to 10 fidus, sepals a little unequal. Petals\r\n4 to 6 equal. Many perigynous stamens. Pistils 8 to 12, ovaries\r\nsessile ovate, styles elongated, stigmas capitated. Berries few,\r\ndistinct, one seeded.\r\n\r\nThis new genus belongs in the analytical and natural method, (see\r\nAnalysis of Nature) to the first natural class _Eltrogynia_, first\r\nnatural order _Rhodanthia_, second natural family _Senticosia_,\r\nnext to the genera _Rubus_, _Oligacis_, &c. It would range itself\r\ninto the artificial class _Icosandria_ of the Linnæan sexual\r\nsystem; but not properly into any of its orders, since the number\r\nof pistils is variable, and never above 12. Only one species\r\nbelongs to it, which I have discovered in company with Mr. Knevels,\r\non the Catskill mountains. The etymology of the name derives from\r\ntwo Greek words meaning _radiated calyx_. It differs essentially\r\nfrom _Rubus_ by the unequal many cleft calyx, variable petals, and\r\nfew pistils.\r\n\r\n_Cylactis montana._ Mountain cylactis--Stem herbaceous upright,\r\nunarmed, pubescent; leaves quinate, nearly smooth, upper ones\r\nsessile, stipules oblong, folioles ovate acuminate, incised,\r\nserrated, ciliated, base acute, entire, the middle one petiolated:\r\nflowers few corymbose, peduncles erect elongated bracteolated;\r\ncalyx pubescent, sepals lanceolate acute, nerved, reflexed; petals\r\ncuneate-obovate, longer than the calyx.\r\n\r\nIt is a small perennial plant, rising about half a foot; flowers\r\nwhite, blossoming in June. On the Catskill mountains near the great\r\nfalls, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _N. G. Nemopanthus._\r\n\r\nDioical. M. flowers calyx 5 phylle, equal, deciduous. No corolla.\r\nStamina 5 hypogynous, alternating with the calyx. Fem. fl. calyx\r\ndeciduous 5 phylle? Ovary ovate, stigma sessile 4 lobed. Berry 4\r\ncelled 4 seeded.\r\n\r\nThe name means _flower with a filiform peduncle_. A shrub forms\r\nthis genus, which had perhaps been united with _ilex_ by Michaux,\r\n&c.; but it differs altogether from it by the want of corolla,\r\nhypogynous stamens, sessile, style, &c. it does not even belong to\r\nthe same family, but to the natural family _Rhamnidia_, natural\r\norder _Plynontia_, and natural class _Eltrogynia_, next to the\r\ngenus _frangula_. In the sexual system it would belong to _Dioecia\r\npentandria_, very far apart from _Frangula_.\r\n\r\n_Nemopanthus fascicularis._ Fascicled nemopanthus. Shrubby,\r\nleaves fasciculated, petiolate, oblong, mucronate, entire, rather\r\nundulated, membranaceous, smooth; flowers axillary fasciculated,\r\npeduncles filiform, shorter than the leaves.\r\n\r\nIt forms a small shrub from 5 to 8 feet high, covered with gray\r\nbark, and with slender upright branches; the flowers are greenish,\r\nvery small, the female flowers have shorter and thicker peduncles;\r\nthey blossom in June. It grows on the Catskill mountains near the\r\ntwo lakes. It is, perhaps, the _Ilex canadensis_? of Michaux and\r\nPursh. And it has some analogy with the _Frangula alnifolia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _N. G. Polanisia._\r\n\r\nCalyx 4 phylle, phylles coloured unequal, the upper one\r\nunguiculated spatulated. Corolla with 4 unequal petals, the two\r\nupper ones larger and unguiculated. A nectarium upwards glandular,\r\nbroad, and truncated. Stamina 9 to 14, unequal, erect, hypogynous.\r\nOvary oblong on a short pedicel, one style, one truncated stigma.\r\nFruit a follicular capsule, one celled, two valved, many seeded,\r\nseeds inserted on each side of each suture, nearly snail-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe type of this genus is the _Cleome dodecandra_ of Linnæus,\r\nunder which denomination many species were blended, which have no\r\nsimilitude with the real genus _cleome_, differing in the calyx,\r\ncorolla, nectarium, stamina, and fruit. I shall describe here that\r\nof North America, where 2 or 3 species exist, besides those of the\r\nWest Indies, Africa, and Asia, which are totally different. The\r\netymology of the name which I have given to it, derives from _many\r\nirregularities_.

If the subsequent observations will be of use to correct\r\nerror, or solve doubts which may have existed concerning some\r\nspecies of gnaphalium, they are at your service.\r\n\r\n  E.

Whitney's gun manufactory, near New-Haven. It is also\r\nfound on the margin of the Housatonick, about thirty miles from\r\nLong Island sound, where it was observed by Dr. Alfred Monson, the\r\nlast summer. Specimens of this plant were sent to Z. Collins, Esq.\r\nof Philadelphia, for the purpose of comparing it with the species\r\nof gnaphalium in Muhlenberg's herbarium, more particularly with the\r\n_luteo-album_ and _Pennsylvanicum_, which I had not seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Gnaphalium decurrens._]\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the politeness of Mr. Collins, for the facts on\r\nthis subject relative to Muhlenberg's herbarium.

XII. _Observations on some Species of Zoophytes. Shells, &c.\r\nprincipally Fossil, by_ THOMAS SAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the following descriptions and notices of some of the animal\r\nproductions of our country, chiefly fossil, and of which some are\r\nbut little known, should be found of sufficient interest to occupy\r\na place in the Journal of Science, they are very much at your\r\nservice for that work.\r\n\r\nThe greater portion of them are extracted, with some modification,\r\nfrom an essay which I read about three years ago, to the Academy\r\nof Natural Sciences, without any intention at the time of giving\r\npublicity to them. But the rapid diffusion of a taste for\r\ngeological research, seems to require corresponding exertions on\r\nthe part of those who have attended to fossil remains, inasmuch as\r\ngeology, in order to be eminently furnished with every advantage\r\nthat may tend to the developement of many important results, must\r\nbe in part founded on a knowledge of the different genera and\r\nspecies of reliquiæ, which the various accessible strata of the\r\nearth present. The accessory value of this species of knowledge,\r\nis now duly estimated in Europe, as affording the most obvious\r\nmeans of estimating, with the greatest approximation to truth, the\r\ncomparative antiquity of formations, and of strata, as well as of\r\nidentifying those with each other which are in their nature similar.\r\n\r\nCertainly very little is yet known about the fossils of North\r\nAmerica, and very little can be known accurately, until we shall\r\nhave it in our power to compare them with approved detailed\r\ndescriptions, plates, or specimens of those of Europe; which have\r\nbeen made known to the world by the indefatigable industry, and\r\nscientific research of Lamarck and other naturalists.\r\n\r\nAmerica is rich in fossils. In many districts of the United States,\r\nvast beds of fossil shells, zoophytes, &c. are deposited, which,\r\nfor the most part, are concealed from the inquiring eye, offering\r\nsuperficially a mere confused mass of mutilated fragments. These\r\nrich repositories must finally be exposed to view, by the onward\r\npace of improvement, and the more interior strata will be unveiled\r\nby some fortunate profound excavations, the result of enterprise\r\nin the pursuit of gain. The very surface of the country in many\r\nregions, is almost overspread with the abundance of casts, or\r\nredintigrate fossils, many of which are apparently specifically\r\nanomalous, and some generically so. The correct, and only useful\r\nmode in which the investigation of our fossils can be conducted, is\r\nattended with some difficulty and labour.\r\n\r\nThe task presumes the knowledge, not only of fossils in all their\r\ndifferent states, from the apparently unchanged specimen, to the\r\nfragment or section of a cast uninsulably imbedded in its rocky\r\nmatrix, but it also requires an adequate acquaintance with recent\r\nspecimens, or those of which the inhabitants are not yet struck\r\nfrom the list of animated beings, in other words those of the\r\npresent, as well as those of the former world.\r\n\r\nDue advantage being taken of the many opportunities which are\r\nfrom time to time offered to us, of obtaining knowledge in this\r\ndepartment, will probably be the means of producing a list of\r\nAmerican animal reliquiæ, coextensive with that of Europe at\r\nthe present day. In the present state of the science, however,\r\nthe correct naturalist will feel it a duty which he owes to his\r\ncolaborators to proceed with the utmost caution, that he may not\r\nadd unnecessarily to the already numerous species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus Alveolites, Lam._\r\n\r\nCoral lapideous, covering extraneous bodies, or in a simple mass,\r\nformed of concentric strata; strata composed each of a union of\r\nnumerous alveoles, which are very short, contiguous, reticulate,\r\nand generally parallel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Species._\r\n\r\n_A. glomeratus_, alveoles vertical, subequal, oval, or obsoletely\r\nhexagonal, much shorter than the diameter, parallel; paries simple;\r\nstrata numerous, forming a rounded mass. (_Cabinet of the Academy\r\nof Natural Sciences._)\r\n\r\nFound often on the coast of North America, cast up by the waves,\r\nthe animals sometimes still living. Forms masses of various sizes\r\nand figures, generally more or less rounded or lobed, and composed\r\nof a great number of concentric layers. The number of these strata\r\nseems to be regulated in some degree, by the quantity of surface\r\nthey have to cover. Thus if the nucleus happens to be a small\r\nshell, such as the _Naticæ_, _Nassæ_, &c. of our coast, or even\r\nthe oyster, (_O. virginica_,) clam, (_V. mercenaria_,) &c. the\r\nstrata are often very numerous; but on the thoracic plate of\r\n_Limulus polyphemus_, having a considerable space over which to\r\nextend themselves, the strata are but few, not more than 2 or 3.\r\nI have seen the thoracic plate of this animal so entirely covered\r\nby the _Alveolite_, as to have the eyes and stemmata concealed so\r\nas to be perfectly blind. When composed of a single layer only,\r\nit much resembles a _Flustra_, or a _Cellapore_ of which the\r\nconvex surfaces have been removed by attrition. The animal I have\r\nnot yet examined. The alveoles or cells of a layer, are arranged\r\nin lines of different degrees of curvature, obscurely radiating\r\nfrom different centres; these lines are placed side by side, the\r\nalveoles alternating with each other throughout the layer in a\r\nquincunx manner; the thickness of the paries is somewhat equal to\r\none half of the conjugate diameter of the alveole, the length of\r\nwhich, or thickness of the layer, is scarcely more considerable;\r\nbut these proportions vary.\r\n\r\nThe species to which it seems allied, are _madreporacea_ and\r\n_incrustans_. The former is fossil, and differs in being subramose;\r\nthe latter forms but a single expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus Favosites, Lam._\r\n\r\nCoral lapideous, simple, of a variable form, composed of parallel\r\nprismatic and fasciculated tubes; tubes contiguous, pentagonal, or\r\nhexagonal, more or less angular, rarely articulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Species._\r\n\r\n_F. striata_, more or less turbinate; _paries of the alveoles_\r\nlongitudinally striated within, and fenestrate with minute osculi;\r\n_alveoles_ with very numerous septæ. (_Cabinet Acad. Nat. Sciences;\r\nand Peale's Museum--common._)\r\n\r\nFound fossil in various parts of the United States, at the falls\r\nof the Ohio; Genessee, New-York; Pittsburg and Wilksbarre,\r\nPennsylvania; Missouri, &c. &c. but not yet in the alluvial deposit\r\nof New-Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are generally, partially, or entirely filled with\r\nsilicious matter, sometimes so completely so, as to resemble\r\nin miniature, basaltic columns; when the alveoles are free on\r\nthe surface, these fossils are known by the name of _petrified\r\nwasp-nests_, from the resemblance they bear to the nests of those\r\ninsects. The silex is usually only infiltrated into the cavities,\r\nleaving the substance of the coral in its original calcareous\r\nstate, but the specimens which are found amongst the rolled pebbles\r\nof the Delaware River, near Philadelphia, are completely silicified.\r\n\r\nThe size varies from one fourth of an ounce, to two hundred pounds\r\nor more, and the tubes occur of every intermediate diameter, from\r\nthe fortieth to one fourth of an inch. It is not common to find any\r\ntwo specimens of like form, they are, however, ordinarily more or\r\nless turbinate, but are sometimes depressed or compressed, and the\r\ntubes rectilinear or excurved, and of various lengths. The dilated\r\nsummit is not so much the effect of a gradual enlargement of the\r\ntubes, as of the frequent and adventitious interposition of young\r\nones, which of course renders the openings of the tubes unequal.\r\nThe tubes or alveoles, vary in the same coral, being 5 or 6, rarely\r\nseven sided, but the hexagonal form is most common; the interior\r\nof a tube is divided into a great number of apartments or cells,\r\nby approximate transverse septæ, each of the cells appears to be\r\nconnected with the corresponding cells of the surrounding tubes,\r\nby lateral orifices in the dividing paries; these orifices are\r\nminute, inequidistant, orbicular, their margins slightly prominent,\r\nand forming from one to three longitudinal series on each side\r\nof the tube; each row is separated from the adjoining one by an\r\nimpressed line. By means of these osculi it seems probable that all\r\nthe animals inhabiting a common coral, were connected together,\r\nor had free communication with each other, but whether by means\r\nof a common organ as in _Pyrosoma_, _Stephanomia_, &c. or simply\r\nby contact as in the aggregating _Salpa_, &c. we have no means of\r\ndetermining.\r\n\r\nThe _striata_ differs from _Madrepora truncata_, Esper. (_F.\r\nalveolata_, Lam.) in not being \"extùs transversè sulcata.\" It seems\r\nto be allied to _Corallium Gothlandicum_, Amœn. Acad. v. 1. p. 106,\r\nand it is possible it may prove synonymous, or very similar to it,\r\nwhen that species becomes better known; the latter has been taken\r\nfor Basalt, and M. Lamarck when describing it, inquires \"Est-ce\r\nun polypier?\" _Madrepora fascicularis_, of Volck. and Parkin. in\r\ncommon with _F. striata_ and _F. Gothlandicum_, is distinguished\r\nby the transverse septa, a character which induced me to refer the\r\nspecies here described to _Favosite_; they seem therefore to be\r\ncongeneric, as analogy indicates a participation in the character\r\nof osculated paries.\r\n\r\nAmongst the great variety exhibited by this species, we have to\r\nremark more particularly the following, viz.:\r\n\r\n1st. Alveoles perfectly free, that is, destitute of aciculi or\r\nlamellæ, the septa wanting, and sometimes the osculi obsolete.\r\n\r\n2d. Alveoles filled almost to the summit with the septa, and\r\nresembling those combs of the bee-hive which are filled with honey\r\nand covered over.\r\n\r\n3d. Paries beset with very numerous, interrupted, alternating,\r\ntransverse lamellæ, which are denticulated at their tips, and\r\nproject towards the centre with various degrees of prominence and\r\nirregularity.\r\n\r\nThe first variety corresponds with the generic character, and\r\nthe third approaches the genus _Porites_; yet so unequivocally\r\nidentical are they, that I have seen them all united in the same\r\nmass, and perforated throughout by the osculi. The identity is\r\nfurther obvious by the perfect gradation which renders them\r\ninseparable.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the transverse septa, I think their presence may be\r\naccounted for by supposing that as the animal elongates its tube in\r\nconsequence of an increase of growth, or in order to maintain an\r\nequal elevation with the adjacent tubes, (rendered necessary by the\r\norigin of young tubes in the interstices) it gradually vacates the\r\nbasal portions of its tube, and sustains itself at the different\r\nelevations, by successively uniting the parietal lamellæ so as\r\nto exclude the vacuity. That this is probable, we may infer from\r\na similar procedure on the part of several species of testaceous\r\nmollusca. Thus some Linnæan _Serpula_ become camerated, and a\r\nfamiliar instance presents itself in the _Triton tritonis_, the\r\nanimal of which adds successive partitions to the interior of the\r\nspire, as that part becomes too strait for the increasing volume\r\nof its body. If the above supposition proves correct, the organs\r\nof communication which pass through the osculi, can hardly be in\r\ncommon, but must rather connect the animals by simple contact only,\r\notherwise these parts would be broken when the animal changes its\r\nplace by vacating the inferior part of the tube.\r\n\r\nThe third variety is then the state of that portion of the\r\ntube which is inhabited by the body of the animal, and not yet\r\ninterrupted by the septæ.\r\n\r\nFrom the above observations, it is evident that this species, and\r\nprobably the entire genus _Favosite_ under which I have placed it,\r\nwill not arrange properly with the _Tubipores_, _Millepores_, &c.\r\nbut must be transferred to the _Polypiers Lamellifères_ of Lamarck.\r\nAnd if the _Madrepora retepora_ of Solander and Ellis, is a true\r\n_Porites_, as M. Lamarck supposes it to be from the appearance of\r\nits tubes, I should conclude this genus to be very proximately\r\nallied to _Favosites_, by that species and the _F. striata_ having\r\nin common the remarkable character of fenestrated paries. But\r\nto this character I should conceive a generic importance ought\r\nto be attached, as indicating a differential organization of\r\nthe artificers. I have no doubt that on close inspection of a\r\nperfect specimen, the same character will be found to exist in _F.\r\nGothlandicum_, and possibly also in _F. truncata_, if not in the\r\nlatter only, it may be proper to separate the genus and to withdraw\r\nfrom _Porites_ the forementioned species, retaining to _striata_\r\nas specifically essential, the second member of the differential\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n(_To be continued._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICS, CHEMISTRY, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XIII. _Observations on Salt Storms, and the Influence of Salt\r\nand Saline Air upon Animal and Vegetable Life. Read before the\r\nLyceum of Natural History of New-York, March 7, 1819, by_ JOHN B.\r\nBECK, M. D.\r\n\r\n(Communicated for this Journal.)\r\n\r\n\r\nMeteorology is a science of so much general concern, that it seems\r\nto be incumbent upon every member of society to aid in augmenting\r\nthe stock of facts, which the labours of ingenious and scientific\r\nmen have already accumulated on that subject. Under this impression\r\nI propose to devote the following paper to some observations on\r\n_salt winds_ or _storms_, as they have occurred in this country\r\nand in Europe--a subject, which although presenting many phenomena\r\nof a more than temporary interest, has as yet excited but little\r\nattention. Indeed, the opportunities for observation have occurred\r\nso rarely as readily to account for its having in a great measure\r\nescaped the philosophical acumen of the present age.\r\n\r\nIt must have been early observed that the atmosphere in the\r\nvicinity of the sea frequently becomes impregnated with saline\r\nmaterials; but the first and only account of a _salt storm_ that I\r\nhave met with, is to be found in the Transactions of the Linnæan\r\nSociety of London. The 8th volume of that work gives an interesting\r\nnarration of the effects of a storm of this description, which\r\noccurred in England, in January, 1803. It was occasioned by an east\r\nwind, which blew for some days, and which, in its passage over\r\nthe ocean, had imbibed large quantities of salt water, which were\r\nafterward deposited upon the land. In most cases these depositions\r\nproved fatal to the plants and vegetables which received them. So\r\nextensive were the effects of this singular storm, that they were\r\nfelt in the vicinity of London, at a distance of about seventy\r\nmiles from the ocean, and in all the intermediate country. In\r\nmost instances, the leaves of the plants, which suffered from\r\nit, appeared as if they had been scorched, and in some places\r\neven the tops of the branches mortified. A storm of the same kind\r\ntook place in England, in February, 1804; and the memoir states,\r\nthat Sir Joseph Banks had noticed another some years before in\r\nLincolnshire.[55]\r\n\r\nA storm attended with similar effects occurred in this country in\r\n1815, and vented its fury upon the eastern states. It commenced on\r\nthe 23d of September, between eight and nine o'clock, A. M. with\r\nthe wind from the east. In about two hours the wind shifted to\r\nsoutheast, and blew a perfect hurricane. The extended devastation\r\nwhich ensued, is still in the recollection of every person. The\r\ntides rose from nine to twelve feet higher than ordinary, and in\r\nmany of the principal cities and towns along the coast of New\r\nEngland, churches, houses, bridges, wharves, and in some instances\r\nvaluable citizens, were buried in one common ruin. In less than\r\nthree hours the gale abated, and before sunset there was a perfect\r\ncalm. Such were the more striking features of this tremendous\r\ngale--but other effects were observed more peculiarly interesting\r\nto the philosopher. At New-London, Salem, and other places, both\r\non the coast, and several miles in the interior, the air was found\r\nto be loaded with salt; and the leaves of many trees appeared, a\r\nfew hours after the storm, as if they had been scorched. Besides\r\nthis effect upon vegetables, there were additional evidences of\r\nthe saline quality of the wind. At Salem and some other places an\r\nincrustation of salt was perceived on the windows, and the fruit in\r\nseveral gardens had a perceptible taste of salt on their surface.\r\nAt New-London it was remarked that the air in the eddies was\r\nextremely hot and suffocating.\r\n\r\nOther facts of a similar nature might be collected, but these it is\r\npresumed are sufficient to characterize the state of the atmosphere\r\nduring that storm.\r\n\r\nSeveral interesting inquiries arise from the consideration of the\r\nforegoing facts.\r\n\r\n1. In what way does the salt exist in the atmosphere in these\r\nstorms? On this point there are two different opinions. The most\r\nprevalent is, that it is merely the spray of the sea driven onward\r\nby the force of the wind. This opinion has received the sanction of\r\nSir Joseph Banks,[56] and also of Sir Humphry Davy, if we may judge\r\nfrom an incidental expression in his Agricultural Chemistry.[57]\r\nAnother opinion[58] is, that muriate of soda is continually rising\r\ninto the atmosphere from the surface of the ocean, and that the\r\nair, in all maritime situations, is thus constantly more or less\r\nimpregnated with salt. The most striking fact in support of this\r\ndoctrine, (so opposite to the commonly received views on the\r\nsubject of the evaporation of sea water) is the actual existence of\r\nmuriate of soda in the rain and snow which fall in the vicinity of\r\nthe ocean.[59] The experiments of Vogel and Bouillon Lagrange, on\r\nthe distillation of sea water, are also in favour of the position,\r\nthat salt may be carried into the air in the ordinary process of\r\nevaporation. On distilling salt water they found a considerable\r\nquantity of muriate of soda in the receiver.[60]\r\n\r\nAdmitting the correctness of these experiments, still it is not\r\neasy to conceive, how they will account satisfactorily for the\r\n_large_ quantities of salt found in the air during the storms under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nWhichever of these solutions may be adopted, it is unquestionably a\r\nfact that salt does, in some way or other, exist in the atmosphere\r\nin the neighbourhood of the sea.\r\n\r\n2. The next object of inquiry is, the influence which this saline\r\nair has upon vegetable life. Independently of the facts already\r\nstated, there are many others which prove its deleterious agency\r\nupon the vegetable creation. Dr. Mitchill informs me, that in some\r\nparts of the south side of Long-Island fruit trees do not thrive\r\nwell, except at a distance of thirty miles from the sea, and even\r\nthe sturdy oak does not extend its branches towards the ocean.[61]\r\nIf I am correctly informed, it was with great difficulty, that\r\nthe trees on our Battery were made to accommodate themselves to a\r\nsituation so near the salt water. It is also well known, that when\r\nplants are taken to sea, they speedily perish, if exposed but a\r\nshort time to a wind, which is sufficiently strong to turn over\r\nthe tops of the waves into _white caps_, as they are called by the\r\nsailors.\r\n\r\nIn order to ascertain positively, whether these effects were to be\r\nattributed to the operation of salt, I made a solution of muriate\r\nof soda in common rain water; with this I watered for a couple of\r\ndays the leaves of different plants. In a short time they began to\r\ndry up, and in a few days were completely dead.\r\n\r\nIt appears from Volney, that the Egyptian air is strongly charged\r\nwith salts. The evidences of it are to be found even at Cairo.[62]\r\nIt is this property of the air, which this philosophical traveller\r\nconsiders, as one of the causes of the rapid vegetation in that\r\ncountry. He mentions, however, that _exotic_ plants will not thrive\r\nthere. It is found necessary to renew the seeds of them every year.\r\nMay not this be occasioned by the saline quality of the air? The\r\n_native_ plants are doubtless accustomed to its action, and do not\r\nso sensibly feel its injurious effects. And if the Egyptian air is\r\nso very penetrating from this very cause, as to produce ophthalmia,\r\nmay we not rationally conclude, that its influence must be equally\r\ninjurious to plants not accustomed to it.\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of the influence of salt on vegetation is\r\nto be found in the _Dead Sea_, or _Lake Asphaltites_. \"In Lake\r\nAsphaltites,\" says Volney, \"there is neither animal nor vegetable\r\nlife. No verdure is to be seen on its banks, nor fish to be found\r\nwithin its waters; but it is not true, that its exhalations are\r\npestiferous, so as to destroy birds flying over it. It is not\r\nuncommon to see swallows skimming its surface, and dipping for\r\nthe water necessary to build their nests. The _true_ cause which\r\ndeprives it of vegetables and animals is the extreme saltness of\r\nthe water, which is vastly stronger than that of the sea. The\r\nsoil around it, equally impregnated with this salt, produces no\r\nplants, and the _air_ itself, which becomes loaded with it from\r\nevaporation, and which receives also the sulphureous and bituminous\r\nvapours, cannot be favourable to vegetation; hence the deadly\r\naspect which reigns around this lake.\"[63]\r\n\r\n3. In what way does the salt operate in producing its deleterious\r\neffects on the leaves of vegetables? It is by no means easy to\r\nanswer this question. It cannot be by shutting up the pores of the\r\nleaf, and thus obstructing its perspiration. It is well known that\r\nwhen the surfaces of leaves are covered with oil, they will soon\r\ndie.[64] But salt water is certainly not sufficiently viscid to act\r\nin a similar way.\r\n\r\nNor can it be satisfactorily attributed to the difference of\r\nstructure between maritime and land plants. There is some\r\ndifference indeed between many of these, maritime plants being\r\ngenerally covered by a pubescence, of which most land plants are\r\ndestitute. It is idle however to suppose that the object of this\r\ncovering is to protect maritime plants from the action of the salt\r\nair, as there are many of them which do not possess it. Besides,\r\nis it not rational to conclude, from the large quantities of soda\r\nwhich are always found in sea plants, that this saline atmosphere\r\nis rather propitious than otherwise to their growth, and that it\r\nonly proves injurious to plants accustomed to the unadulterated air\r\nof the land.\r\n\r\nAgain, I do not think that it can be explained by supposing, that\r\nthe salt is absorbed into the plant, and thus acts as a poisonous\r\nsubstance. We know, that in land plants which are cultivated in the\r\nneighbourhood of the sea, salt is absorbed through their roots.[65]\r\nIt must of course circulate with the juices through the whole\r\nplant; and yet in these cases the leaves are not destroyed by it.\r\n\r\nThe most plausible method of explaining it appears to be this: that\r\nthe salt, by its irritating or corrosive power, destroys the small\r\nvessels in the leaf which are necessary for the circulation going\r\non in it during health.\r\n\r\nDr. Darwin has ingeniously shown the analogy between the functions\r\nof the leaves of plants, and the lungs of animals. If this be\r\nadmitted, it will not be difficult to account for the action of\r\nsalt upon leaves. This substance, when taken into the stomach,\r\nproves not merely innocuous, but wholesome; but when accidentally\r\nintroduced into the lungs, irritation, inflammation, and death\r\nare the consequences. So with plants--when admitted into them in\r\ncombination with their juices, it may be harmless; but when applied\r\nto the lungs or leaves, death ensues.\r\n\r\n4. I shall devote the remainder of this paper to a few concise\r\nobservations on the effects of salt, and a saline atmosphere, upon\r\n_animal_ life.\r\n\r\nUpon the more imperfect animals, such as slugs, worms, toads, &c.\r\nit is well known that salt proves speedily destructive of life.\r\nIt is not my intention to attempt an explanation of this singular\r\nfact. But it is remarkable that it should not have been turned to\r\nbetter account in the treatment of those worms, which infest the\r\nhuman body. Although used for that purpose by the common people\r\nin Ireland as well as in this country, I believe it has not,\r\nuntil very lately, claimed the attention of the profession, as an\r\nanthelmintick. A late English journal[66] contains a notice of some\r\ncases which satisfactorily prove its efficacy, when administered\r\nwith this intention. This fact, in addition to numerous others,\r\nstrikingly illustrates the advantages which the healing art might\r\nderive from a careful observation of the phenomena daily developed\r\nby the collateral sciences.\r\n\r\nIn cases of _hæmoptysis_ and _hæmatemesis_, common salt has been\r\nused with decided success. The public is indebted to Dr. Rush, for\r\nthe introduction of this remedy into general practice.\r\n\r\nDr. Hosack informs me, that he has found sea air extremely salutary\r\nin _remittent fever_, _cholera infantum_, and _dyspepsia_.\r\n\r\nAmong the deleterious effects caused by a _saline atmosphere_, may\r\nbe mentioned the _ophthalmia_ of Egypt. This disease is so common\r\nthere, \"that out of a hundred persons,\" says Volney, \"I have met\r\nwhile walking the streets of Cairo, twenty have been quite blind,\r\nten wanting an eye, and twenty others have had their eyes red,\r\npurulent, or blemished.\"[67] Throughout the Delta, and at Cairo,\r\nthis complaint is more prevalent than in any other part of Egypt.\r\nIn Syria it is also common, although less so than in Egypt, but\r\nit is only met with on the _sea-coast_. The reasoning of Volney\r\non this subject, is decisive of the position, that the prevalence\r\nof this complaint, in these regions, is owing to their proximity\r\nto the ocean. In confirmation, he states that he has himself\r\nexperienced the irritating effects of the air of the Delta upon the\r\norgan of vision.[68]\r\n\r\nIn those cases of _scurvy_ which occur in long voyages, the saline\r\nnature of the atmosphere co-operates very powerfully with salt\r\nprovisions and bad water, in producing that general vitiation of\r\nthe system which characterizes this disorder.\r\n\r\nOf all diseases, however, those of the lungs appear to be most\r\naffected by a saline air. I have known a lady of this city who had\r\nbeen afflicted for many years with _asthma_, to be essentially\r\nbenefited by a voyage across the Atlantic. Another case has fallen\r\nunder my observation, of a lady troubled with asthma, being much\r\nrelieved by removing from the interior to this city. What proves\r\nbeyond a doubt that her relief is owing to the air she breathes,\r\nis, that whenever she takes a jaunt into the country, she is sure\r\nto suffer a paroxysm of her old complaint.\r\n\r\n_Pulmonary consumption_ certainly prevails more on the sea-coast,\r\nthan in the interior. In all our sea-port towns, it is this\r\ndisorder which so frightfully augments the catalogue of our bills\r\nof mortality. According to Dr. Rush, \"in Salem, in the state\r\nof Massachusetts, which is situated near the sea, and exposed,\r\nduring many months of the year, to a moist east wind, there died\r\nin the year 1799, 160 persons; fifty-three of whom died of the\r\nconsumption.\"[69] In Philadelphia, which is more remote from the\r\nsea, the deaths from consumption are much less numerous than in\r\nNew-York, or the other cities immediately on the coast. In Great\r\nBritain, which is exposed to the sea on all sides, it is calculated\r\nthat about 55,000 die annually from this disease.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the facts on this subject; but the conclusion\r\ndoes not appear to be warranted, that these pulmonary affections\r\narise from the irritating quality of the air. In Holland, the West\r\nIndies, as well as in other countries and islands, exposed to the\r\nsea air, consumption is of rare occurrence. In Syria, Volney even\r\nstates that the air of the coast is particularly favourable to\r\nthose labouring under this malady. Accordingly they are in the\r\nhabit of sending such patients from Aleppo to Latakia, or Saide,\r\nwhere they may enjoy the benefit of sea air.[70]\r\n\r\nAgain, we know that many persons suffering from this affection,\r\nhave been completely cured by a voyage, after all the resources of\r\nmedicine had been exhausted upon them in vain.\r\n\r\nIt is evident then, that a _pure_ sea air is not detrimental in\r\ncases of consumption. Dr. Rush, with his usual ingenuity, explains\r\nthe prevalence of this complaint in our sea-ports, by attributing\r\nit to the mixture of land and sea air; and in confirmation\r\nobserves, that \"those situations which are in the neighbourhood of\r\nbays and rivers, where the fresh and salt waters mix their streams\r\ntogether, are more unfavourable to consumptive patients than the\r\nseashore, and therefore should be more carefully avoided by them in\r\nexchanging city for country air.\"[71]\r\n\r\nIndependently, however, of these causes, I think the frequent and\r\nsudden vicissitudes of temperature, which we suffer on the coast,\r\nare alone sufficient to account for the prevalence of catarrhal and\r\npneumonic affections, which most commonly are the precursors of\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\nI trust the foregoing observations have not been considered too\r\n_medical_ to comport with the objects of this Society. Natural\r\nhistory is only useful in its practical applications; and if it\r\ncan be shown to throw any light upon an art, which contributes so\r\nmuch to the comfort and happiness of man, we have established one\r\nof the strongest considerations, which can recommend it to general\r\npatronage and investigation. Physicians ought in an especial manner\r\nto set a high value upon the researches of naturalists. The aid\r\nthey have already given is sufficient to entitle them to the\r\nlasting gratitude of our profession. It was one of the merits of\r\nthat illustrious physician of our own time and country, Dr. Rush,\r\nthat he seized with avidity every fact, from whatever quarter\r\nit might be drawn, to elucidate his favourite science. If ever\r\nmedicine shall attain to the elevation of a truly _philosophical\r\nscience_, it must be accomplished, in part at least, by imitating\r\nhis example, and by developing the infinite and diversified\r\nassociations which exist between it and the other sciences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XIV. _Thoughts on Atmospheric Dust. By_ C. S. RAFINESQUE,\r\n_Esq._\r\n\r\n\r\n1. \"When we find the ruins of ancient cities buried under ground;\r\nwhen the plough uncovers the front of palaces and the summit of\r\nold temples, we are astonished: but we seldom reflect why they are\r\nhidden in the earth. A sort of imperceptible dust falls at all\r\ntimes from the atmosphere, and it has covered them during ages.\"\r\n\r\n2. These are the words of the worthy and eloquent philosopher\r\nVIREY, in his article Nature, Vol. XV. p. 373, of the French\r\nDictionary of Natural History. Even before reading them I had\r\nobserved the same phenomenon, and I have since studied their\r\neffects in various places. I could quote one thousand instances of\r\nthe extensive and multifarious operations of this meteoric dust:\r\nbut I mean to give the results merely of those that fall daily\r\nunder notice, and are yet totally neglected; wishing to draw on\r\nthem the attention of chemists, philosophers, and geologists.\r\n\r\n3. Whenever the sun shines in a dark room, its beams display a\r\ncrowd of lucid dusty molecules of various shapes, which were\r\nbefore invisible as the air in which they swim, but did exist\r\nnevertheless. These form the atmospheric dust; existing every where\r\nin the lower strata of our atmosphere. I have observed it on the\r\ntop of the highest mountains, on Mount Etna, in Sicily, on the\r\nAlps, on the Alleghany and Catskill mountains in America, &c. and\r\non the ocean.\r\n\r\n4. It deserves to be considered under many views: which are its\r\ninvisibility, its shape and size, its formation and origin, its\r\nmotion, its deposition and accumulation, its composition, its uses,\r\nand its properties.\r\n\r\n5. This dust is invisible, owing to the tenuity of its particles,\r\nbut they become visible in the following instances; when the sun\r\nshines on them, since they reflect the light, when their size is\r\nincreased, and when they are accumulated any where.\r\n\r\n6. The size of the particles is very unequal, and their shape\r\ndissimilar; the greatest portion are exceedingly small, similar to\r\na whitish or grayish spark, without any determinable or perceptible\r\nshape; the larger particles are commonly lamellar or flattened, but\r\nwith an irregular margin, and the largest appear to be lengthened\r\nor filiform; the gray colour prevails. Other shapes are now and\r\nthen perceptible with the microscope.\r\n\r\n7. Among the properties of atmospheric dust are those of being\r\nsoft, as light as atmospheric air, of reflecting the rays\r\nreceived directly from the sun, of possessing a kind of peculiar\r\nelectricity, which gives it a tendency to accumulate on some\r\nbodies more readily than on some others, and of forming an earthy\r\nsediment, which does not become effervescent with acids.\r\n\r\n8. This dust is either constantly or periodically formed, but\r\nchemically in the atmosphere like snow, hail, meteoric stones,\r\nhoney-dew, earthy rains, &c. by the combination of gaseous and\r\nelementary particles dissolved in the air. Its analysis has never\r\nbeen attempted by chemists; but the earthy sediment which is the\r\nresult of its accumulated deposition, proves that it is a compound\r\nof earthy particles in a peculiar state of aggregation, and in\r\nwhich alumine appears to preponderate, rather than calcareous or\r\nsilicious earths or oxides.\r\n\r\n9. Its motion in calm weather, or in a quiet room, is very slow;\r\nthe particles appear to float in the air in all directions, some\r\nrising, some falling, and many swimming horizontally, or forming\r\na variety of curved lines; what is most singular, is that no two\r\nparticles appear to have exactly the same direction; yet after\r\nawhile the greatest proportion fall down obliquely, somewhat in the\r\nsame manner as a light snow in a calm day. When a current of air is\r\ncreated naturally or artificially in the open air or in a room, you\r\nperceive at once an increased velocity in their motion; they move\r\nwith rapidity in all directions; but when a strong current or wind\r\nprevails, they are carried with it in a stream, preserving however,\r\nas yet, their irregular up and down motion.\r\n\r\n10. Its formation is sometimes very rapid, and its accumulation\r\nvery thick in the lower strata of our atmosphere, but the intensity\r\nis variable. Whenever rain or snow falls, this dust is precipitated\r\non the ground by it, whence arises the purity of the air after rain\r\nand snow; but a small share is still left, or soon after formed. In\r\ncommon weather it deposits itself on the ground by slow degrees,\r\nand the same in closed rooms. It forms then the dust of our floors,\r\nthe mould of our roofs, and ultimately the surface of our soil,\r\nunless driven by winds from one place to another.\r\n\r\n11. I have measured its accumulation in a quiet room, and have\r\nfound it variable from one-fourth of an inch to one inch in the\r\ncourse of one year; but it was then in a pulverulent fleecy state,\r\nand might be reduced by compression to one-third of its height,\r\nmaking the average of yearly deposit about one-sixth of an inch.\r\nIn the open air this quantity must be still more variable, owing\r\nto the quantities carried by the winds and waters to the plains,\r\nvalleys, rivers, the sea, &c. or accumulated in closed places or\r\nagainst walls, houses, &c. I calculate, however, that upon an\r\naverage, from six to twelve inches are accumulated over the ground\r\nin one hundred years, where it mixes with the soil and organic\r\nexuviæ, to form the common mould.\r\n\r\n12. The uses of this chronic meteor are many and obvious. It serves\r\nto create mould over rocks, to increase their decomposition, to\r\nadd to our cultivable soil, to amalgamate the alluvial and organic\r\ndeposits, to fertilize sandy and unfruitful tracts in the course of\r\ntime, to administer to vegetable life, &c. It does not appear that\r\nit has any bad influence on men and animals breathing it along with\r\nair, unless it should be accumulated in a very intense degree.\r\n\r\n13. At Segesta, in Sicily, are to be seen the ruins of an ancient\r\ntemple; the steps, which surround it on all sides below the\r\npillars, are built on a rock, on the top of a hill detached from\r\nany other higher ground. Yet now all the steps and the base of the\r\npillars are under the ground, which has accumulated from this dust\r\nand the decay of plants (not trees) to which it has afforded food.\r\nThere are from five to eight feet from the rock to the surface\r\nof this new soil, which has chemically combined in a variety\r\nof hardness. This soil has arisen there in about 2000 years,\r\nnotwithstanding the washings of rain. I quote this as a remarkable\r\ninstance of the increase of soil by aerial deposits, among many\r\nwhich have fallen under my personal examination.\r\n\r\n14. It is commonly believed that the dust of our rooms is produced\r\nby the fragments of decomposed vestments, beddings, furnitures,\r\n&c.; this cause increases it, and produces a different dust, which\r\nmixes with the atmospheric dust; but it is very far from producing\r\nit.\r\n\r\n15. The dust of the open air is ascribed to that raised from\r\nroads and fields, by the pulverization of their surface; but this\r\nsecondary and visible dust is only a consequence of the first. From\r\nwhence could arise the dust observed by the means of the sunbeams\r\nin a dark corner, in winter, when the ground is frozen, or when it\r\nis wet and muddy, or at sea, or on the top of rocky mountains?\r\n\r\n16. It is therefore a matter of fact, worth taking into\r\nconsideration by geologists, that the air still deposits a quantity\r\nof dust, which must have been much greater in former periods. Just\r\nthe same as the sea deposits still a quantity of earthy and saline\r\nparticles dissolved in it, and which were superabundant at the\r\nperiod when the rocky strata were formed on its bottom. Water being\r\nmore compact, deposits rocks. Air, which is less dense, deposits a\r\npulverulent matter!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XV. _On the Effect of Vapour on Flame. By_ J. F. DANA,\r\n_Chemical Assistant in Harvard University, and Lecturer on\r\nChemistry and Pharmacy in Dartmouth College_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Cambridge, Mass. February 5, 1819._\r\n\r\n  _To Professor Silliman._\r\n\r\n  DEAR SIR,\r\n\r\nAbout a year since I made some experiments on the effect of steam\r\non ignited bodies, with a view to learn the theory of the action\r\nof the \"American water-burner.\" These experiments were published\r\nin an anonymous paper in the North American Review, and have been\r\npublished in London, without an acknowledgment of their source.\r\n\r\nThe effect of them concerning bodies is peculiar, and it probably\r\nadmits of more extensive application to the arts than in the above\r\nnamed instrument alone.\r\n\r\nWhen a jet of steam, issuing from a small aperture, is thrown\r\non burning charcoal, the brightness is increased, if the coal\r\nbe held at the distance of four or five inches from the pipe\r\nthrough which the steam passes; but if the coal be held nearer it\r\nis extinguished, a circular black spot first appears where the\r\nsteam is thrown on it. The steam in this case does not appear to\r\nbe decomposed, and the increased brightness of the coal depends\r\nprobably on a current of atmospheric air, occasioned by the steam.\r\nBut when a jet of steam, instead of being thrown on a single\r\ncoal, is made to pass into a charcoal fire, the vividness of the\r\ncombustion is increased, and the low attenuated flame of coal is\r\nenlarged.\r\n\r\nWhen the wick of a common oil lamp is raised, so as to give off\r\nlarge columns of smoke, and a jet of steam is thrown into it, the\r\nbrightness of the flame is increased, and no smoke is thrown off.\r\n\r\nWhen spirits of turpentine is made to burn on a wick, the light\r\nproduced is dull and reddish, and a large quantity of thick smoke\r\nis given off; but when a jet of steam is thrown into this flame,\r\nits brightness is much increased; and when the experiment is\r\ncarefully performed, the smoke entirely disappears.\r\n\r\nWhen the vapour of spirits of turpentine is made to issue from\r\na small orifice, and inflamed, it burns, and throws off large\r\nquantities of smoke; but when a jet of steam is made to unite with\r\nthe vapour, the smoke entirely disappears. When vapour of spirits\r\nof turpentine and of water are made to issue together from the same\r\norifice, and inflamed, no smoke appears. Hence its disappearing, in\r\nthe above experiment, cannot be supposed to depend on a current of\r\natmospheric air.\r\n\r\nWhen a jet of steam is thrown into the flame of a spirit of wine\r\nlamp, or into flames which evolve no smoke or carbonaceous matter,\r\nthe same effect is produced as by a current of air.\r\n\r\nIt appears, from these experiments, that in all flames which evolve\r\nsmoke, steam produces an increased brightness, and a more perfect\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\nNow, with a very simple apparatus, steam might be introduced into\r\nthe flames of street lamps, and that kind of lamp which is used\r\nin butchers' shops in London, and in all flames which evolve\r\nmuch smoke. The advantage of such an arrangement would be a more\r\nperfect combustion, and a greater quantity of light from the same\r\nmaterials. The flame of the lamps, to which steam is applied, might\r\nbe made to keep the water boiling which supplies the steam.\r\n\r\nI hope the above may not be altogether uninteresting and useless to\r\nthe readers of your Journal.\r\n\r\n  Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n  J. F. DANA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XVI. _Analysis of the Harrodsburg Salts, by_ EDWARD D. SMITH,\r\nM. D. _Professor of Chemistry and Mineralogy in the South-Carolina\r\nCollege_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMore than a year since I received a quantity of a white earthy\r\nsubstance, which was said to be obtained by the evaporation of\r\ncertain mineral waters at Harrodsburg, Kentucky, and there vended\r\nat a considerable price, under the name of Epsom salts. The\r\nrespectable character who presented this powder to me, requested\r\nthat I would make an analysis of it; but I had not sufficient\r\nleisure until lately, to pay the requisite attention to this\r\nsubject. The results of my examinations are now submitted to the\r\npublic eye.\r\n\r\nThe external qualities of this substance are as follow: small white\r\nlumps, hard to the touch, but dry and easily yielding to pressure,\r\nsomewhat gritty to the teeth, and imparting an earthy and saline\r\ntaste to the tongue.\r\n\r\n1. 120 grains of the powder were put into about a half ounce of\r\nalcohol, digested for six hours, then, washed with more alcohol,\r\nfiltered and carefully dried.\r\n\r\n2. On weighing the dry powder, the loss appeared to be but one\r\ngrain, so that it contains very little of any substance which is\r\nsoluble in alcohol.\r\n\r\n3. 115 grains (four grains having been lost in the transfer from\r\nthe filter) were collected and put into rather more than eight\r\ntimes their weight of cold distilled water, and digested for two\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n4. This watery solution was then filtered, and on weighing, the\r\nresidue appeared to be 48 grains, so that 67 grains must have been\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\n5. 10 grains of the insoluble residue (4) were put into a flask,\r\nwith 10 ounces of distilled water, and boiled for 1 hour.\r\n\r\n6. A small portion of this solution, on being tested with nitrate\r\nof barytes, gave a copious white precipitate, with oxalic acid,\r\na white cloud; with ammonia, a slight white cloud; with muriatic\r\nacid, a slight bluish tinge. From these tests it was inferred\r\nthat sulphate of lime was present, with perhaps a slight trace of\r\nmuriate of lime.\r\n\r\n7. The remainder of this solution was filtered, and on weighing the\r\ndried residuum, the loss appeared to be 2 grains, so that sulphate\r\nof lime probably constitutes nearly ⅕ of the insoluble residence\r\n(48 grains. 4.)\r\n\r\n8. The watery solution, (4) which was supposed to contain 67\r\ngrains, was evaporated, and left a residue that weighed but 34\r\ngrains, so that 33 grains must have disappeared in the process.\r\n\r\n9. Some of this residue dissolved in distilled water, was tested\r\nwith carbonate of soda, forming an immediate white cloud; with\r\nnitrate of barytes, the same; with ammonia, the same; but with\r\noxalate of ammonia, it did not form any cloud until it had stood\r\nsome time, and then it was slight. From these tests it was inferred\r\nthat sulphate of magnesia was present.\r\n\r\n10. A portion of the dried residuum (7) was treated with diluted\r\nmuriatic acid, which dissolved nearly the whole of it, with\r\nconsiderable effervescence. The new compound, on examination,\r\nproved to be muriate of lime; so that it may be concluded the\r\nresiduum (7) was principally carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nOn considering the results of the preceding experiments, it will\r\nappear that more than one half of the substances submitted to\r\nanalysis, was easily soluble in water, and from the chemical tests\r\nused, that it was composed principally of sulphate of magnesia,\r\n(Epsom salt) with perhaps a small portion of muriate of lime or\r\nmagnesia, that of the remainder, about ⅕ was sulphate of lime,\r\nand difficultly soluble in water; and that the rest was perfectly\r\ninsoluble in water, and consisted principally of carbonate of lime.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt then, that the Harrodsburg salt, in its\r\npresent state, is very improperly prepared, containing in its\r\ncomposition a large proportion of matter, that is not only inert,\r\nbut which may produce considerable inconvenience and injury in the\r\nstomach and bowels, from its ponderous nature and tendency to form\r\nmechanical obstructions. Perhaps the occurrence of such injury may\r\nnot be frequent, from the circumstance of a large portion of the\r\nsalt being so insoluble; but admitting this to be the fact, there\r\nis a manifest impropriety in offering to the public, as medicine,\r\nan article which cannot be used as such. Probably the proprietors\r\nof this manufactory are not aware of the real nature of the case,\r\nand of the facility with which, by a little additional trouble,\r\nthey could separate the useful and valuable material, from that\r\nwhich is at least useless, and which might also be pernicious.\r\n\r\n_South-Carolina College, March, 1819._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XVII. _Additional Notice of the Tungsten and Tellurium,\r\nmentioned in our last Number._\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I. _Description of the Ore._\r\n\r\nColour, dark brown, almost black; brittle, powder a lighter shade\r\nof brown than the mineral; hard, scratches glass, scintillates with\r\nsteel, with a red spark; a degree of polish produced, where the\r\nsteel strikes, and when the steel is impressed upon it.\r\n\r\nStructure compact, in some places slightly porous; lustre,\r\ngenerally dull, sometimes glimmering, and almost resinous.\r\n\r\nCrystals octahedral. Specific gravity of three massive pieces, 5.7,\r\n6. and 6.44 mean, 6.05 nearly; probably that of the crystals would\r\nbe higher.\r\n\r\nInfusible by the blow-pipe even with borax, and does not by strong\r\nignition impart any colour to it or to potash; not magnetic, even\r\nin fine powder, nor after being heated red hot on charcoal, and in\r\ncontact with burning grease.\r\n\r\nMany specimens decrepitate violently under the blow-pipe. When\r\nheated on coals in pieces of considerable size, they often explode\r\nwith a smart report, and are thrown in fragments sometimes several\r\nyards from the fire.\r\n\r\nGangue quartz; accompanying minerals in the same vein, native\r\nbismuth, native silver, galena, iron and copper pyrites, much\r\nmagnetic pyrites, blende, &c.\r\n\r\n_Geological relations._ The country is primitive, and the immediate\r\nrock which forms the walls of the vein is said to be gneiss; (we\r\nhave not seen it.)\r\n\r\nLocality, town of Huntington, parish of New Stratford, county of\r\nFairfield, 20 miles west from New-Haven, Connecticut.\r\n\r\n_Remark._ Native bismuth in small quantities, has been for several\r\nyears obtained from this mine, but the shaft has been sunk only\r\nabout ten feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II. _A variety of the Ore._\r\n\r\nGeneral characters as above, but on some parts, there is seen a\r\nwhitish, or yellowish, or sometimes darkish metallic substance; it\r\nis in thin plates, like the leaf metals, and sometimes reticulated,\r\nand graphic in its disposition; it is soft and easily cut with the\r\nknife. In the specimens examined, it was so much blended with the\r\nother ore, and so trifling in quantity, that it was not possible to\r\nseparate it mechanically, so as to examine it separately.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.--A. _Chemical Trials._\r\n\r\n1. Muriatic acid, hot or cold, produces no effect; hot\r\nnitro-muriatic dissolves the ore with energy, red fumes are\r\nevolved, and generally a red solution obtained, from which ammonia\r\nprecipitates red oxyd of iron abundantly.\r\n\r\n2. A heavy lemon-yellow powder remains, insoluble of course in\r\nacids, but easily and completely soluble in warm ammonia.\r\n\r\n3. A dark powder, in diminished quantity, again appears, more acid\r\ndissolves it in part, and again reveals the yellow powder, which\r\nammonia again dissolves, and so on, till nothing remains but some\r\nportion of the gangue.\r\n\r\n4. The ammoniacal solution, which contains the oxyd of tungsten, is\r\ndecomposed by acids, and by heat, and instantly deposits a white\r\nheavy powder, becoming yellowish by standing, and full yellow by\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n5. This powder is infusible by the blow-pipe, but ignited with\r\nborax in a platinum crucible, it became of a superb blue, like\r\nsmalt, or between that and Prussian blue.\r\n\r\n6. The quantity obtained was too small to make it convenient to\r\nattempt its reduction to the metallic state; no doubt remained,\r\nhowever, that it was oxyd of tungsten, or as it is sometimes\r\ncalled, tungstic acid.\r\n\r\n7. There were traces of manganese, and all the facts perhaps\r\njustify the conclusion, that the ore is very similar to the\r\nferruginous tungsten or wolfram.\r\n\r\n8. The calcareous tungsten occurs in octahedral crystals, but we\r\nhave not before heard of this form in the ferruginous species,\r\nwhich generally affects the prismatic forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nB. REMARK.\r\n\r\nWe had been for some time inclined to believe, that the above ore\r\nwas ferruginous tungsten, but although fortified by the opinion of\r\nCol. Gibbs, we were withheld from announcing it, because the form\r\nof the crystals, the specific gravity, the colour, and perhaps\r\nsome other characters, were not perfectly accordant with European\r\ndescriptions, and with the specimens in our possession, which are\r\nfrom Saxony and Cornwall.\r\n\r\nDuring the necessary chemical trials (which have, we trust,\r\nestablished the correctness of the above opinion,) we very\r\nunexpectedly discovered in some of the ores of tungsten, proofs\r\nof the existence of tellurium. The conclusion was induced by the\r\nphenomena, for nothing was farther from our expectations.\r\n\r\nTwo fragments were pulverized _by an assistant_, and we therefore\r\ncannot say whether they had any external characters different from\r\nthose of the other pieces; they came, however, from the same part\r\nof the vein, and their powder resembled that of the other pieces.\r\n\r\n1. Digested in nitro-muriatic acid, a straw-yellow solution,\r\nslightly inclining to green, was obtained, and a black powder was\r\nleft behind.\r\n\r\n2. More acid digested on this powder, gave a deep red solution of\r\niron, and left the yellow oxyd of tungsten, which being dissolved\r\nin ammonia, the black powder again appeared, and so on, as under 3.\r\nPart III.\r\n\r\n3. The solution 1, diluted largely with water, deposited an\r\nabundant white precipitate, which was very heavy and rapidly\r\nsubsided.\r\n\r\n4. Alcohol and ammonia, respectively produced the same effect, only\r\nmore decidedly.\r\n\r\n5. This precipitate, evidently an oxyd of a metal, being collected\r\non a filter and dried, exhibited the following properties.\r\n\r\n6. Heated by the blow-pipe on charcoal, it was instantly\r\nvolatilized in part, and in part decomposed, with an almost\r\nexplosive effervescence; numerous ignited globules of metal\r\nappeared on the charcoal, and burned with an abundant flame of a\r\ndelicate blue colour, edged occasionally with green.\r\n\r\n7. In many trials, these results always occurred, and sometimes\r\na peculiar odour was perceived, at first thought to be owing to\r\narsenic, but it was incomparably feebler, and somewhat resembled\r\nthat of radishes.[72]\r\n\r\n8. Zinc, iron, and tin, plunged into separate portions of the\r\nnitro-muriatic solution, precipitated abundantly a black flocculent\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n9. On charcoal before the blow-pipe, this substance was very\r\ncombustible, with a blue flame, and was completely dissipated in\r\nthe form of white oxyd, with the above smell.\r\n\r\n10. Some of it was obtained on the charcoal in metallic globules;\r\nit was a brittle metal, white, with a tinge of red, and foliated,\r\nbut not so distinctly as bismuth and antimony.\r\n\r\n11. The filters on which the white oxyd had been deposited, burned\r\nalmost with explosion, nearly as rapidly as if they had been soaked\r\nwith nitrate of potash, or of ammonia, and the characteristic blue\r\nflame appeared while the burning lasted.\r\n\r\n12. Other experiments were made upon the metal, (not the oxyd.) It\r\ngave to strong sulphuric acid, (simply by standing in it in the\r\ncold) an amethystine colour, which disappeared as the acid grew\r\nweaker, by attracting water from the air.\r\n\r\n13. With nitric acid it formed a colourless solution, not\r\ndecomposed by water.\r\n\r\n14. It did not dissolve in muriatic acid, till a few drops of\r\nnitric acid were added.\r\n\r\n15. The white oxyd heated with charcoal in a small coated recurved\r\nglass tube, afforded brilliant metallic globules, which rose by\r\ndistillation, collected in the bend of the tube, and resembled\r\ndrops of quicksilver, except that they were solid.\r\n\r\n\r\nC. REMARK.\r\n\r\nThe above facts having induced the conclusion that the metal, thus\r\nunexpectedly discovered in the ores of tungsten, was tellurium,[73]\r\nwe were led to search for external characters by which to judge\r\nwhat specimens contained it. The ores from Transylvania, (the\r\nonly telluric ores with which we are acquainted,) bearing no\r\nanalogy in appearance or composition to those before us, we were\r\nled to inquire whether the tellurium in these latter ores was _in\r\ncombination_ with tungsten, or merely _in mixture_. The external\r\ncharacters detailed in part II, tend perhaps to fortify the\r\nlatter opinion. If we mistake not, we there found a proper ore of\r\ntellurium mixed with a proper ore of tungsten, but we have also by\r\nchemical means, found tellurium where similar external characters\r\nwere not apparent. Before the appearance of our next Number, we\r\nhope to obtain purer and better specimens. In the mean time we add\r\nthe following facts.\r\n\r\n1. A crystal, and a massive piece of the kind described under part\r\nI, and specimens of two varieties of those described under part II,\r\nwere digested in nitro-muriatic acid.\r\n\r\n2. Both oxyd of tungsten, and oxyd of tellurium were obtained from\r\nall of them.\r\n\r\n3. Many specimens have been examined which have afforded tungsten\r\nonly, and no tellurium.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a convenient time, it is hoped that a more complete examination\r\nof this subject may be presented to the public.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, we may submit to mineralogists and chemists,\r\nwhether if this is not a new mineral, it is not at least a new\r\nassociation of two minerals before known. It has not been forgotten\r\nthat gold and silver are frequently combined with tellurium:\r\nneither of them has, however, been discovered, (although sought\r\nafter by proper tests) during the above trials.\r\n\r\n_Yale College, March, 1819._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XVIII. _A Substitute for Woulfe's or Nooth's Apparatus,\r\nby_ ROBERT HARE, M. D. _Professor of Chemistry in the Medical\r\nDepartment of the University of Pennsylvania, and Member of various\r\nLearned and Scientific Societies_. With a Plate.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew subjects have more occupied the attention of chemists, than\r\nthe means of impregnating fluids with gaseous substances. The\r\ncontrivances of Woulfe and Nooth, especially the former, have\r\nbeen almost universally used; and have gained for the inventors\r\nmerited celebrity. Various improvements in Woulfe's bottles have\r\nbeen devised. Still I believe an apparatus replete with similar\r\nadvantages, but less unwieldy, less liable to fracture; and having\r\nfewer junctures to make at each operation, has been a great\r\ndesideratum with every practical chemist. It has, however, ceased\r\nto be so with me, since I contrived the apparatus which I am about\r\nto describe.\r\n\r\nFig. 1. represents 3 jars placed concentrically within each other,\r\nand so proportioned and situated, as to admit 2 open-necked\r\nconcentric bell glasses alternately between them. The neck of\r\nthe exterior bell glass is introduced into the tubulure of the\r\nreceiver above, and receives the neck of the interior bell glass.\r\nInto this is inserted a trumpet-shaped tube. The two interior jars\r\nare furnished with feet F, _f_. In order to put this apparatus into\r\noperation, remove (without taking them apart) the bell glasses,\r\nreceiver, and tube from the jars. Pour into the latter the fluid,\r\nto be impregnated, till it reaches the height marked by the dots.\r\nThe funnel mouth, _m_, of the receiver being provided with a\r\nsuitable cork soaked in wax, fasten into it firmly the beak of the\r\nretort, containing the generating materials. The bell glasses are\r\nthen to be replaced in the jars, and arranged as in the figure. It\r\nmust be self-evident that the gas proceeding from the retort, (if\r\nthe juncture at _m_ be air tight) must press on the fluid in the\r\ninnermost jar, through the trumpet-shaped tube. If not imbibed with\r\nadequate speed, it must soon press on the fluid at _a_, causing it\r\nto subside to the narrow part of the foot _f_, and thus to expose\r\na much larger surface. If the absorption be still inadequate, a\r\nfurther subsidence must ensue, and the gas escaping round the\r\nbrim of the interior bell glass will act on the fluid at _b_, and\r\nenlarge its surface by depressing it to the narrow part of the foot\r\nF. Should the increased pressure and more extended contact thus\r\nobtained, be still incompetent to effect a complete absorption, the\r\nexcess of the gas may escape round the brim of the external bell\r\nglass into the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 1._\r\n\r\n_Fig. 4._\r\n\r\n_Fig. 5._\r\n\r\n_Fig. 3._\r\n\r\n_Fig. 2._\r\n\r\n_Drawn & Engraved by Kneass, Young & Co._]\r\n\r\nBut so effectual is this process in promoting impregnation, that\r\nI have obtained strong muriatic acid in the central jar, without\r\nproducing any sensible acidity in the outside one. Absorption\r\ninto the retort or receiver, is prevented by not allowing as much\r\nfluid to be above the mouth of the trumpet-shaped tube, as would\r\nbe competent to fill the cavity between it, and the termination\r\nof the open neck of the exterior bell glass at _t_. As this neck\r\nrises about 2 or 3 inches into the receiver, it prevents any foul\r\nmatter which may condense or boil over, from getting into the jars.\r\nIf practicable, it would be better that the bell glasses, and\r\ntube, and receiver, should be united together while hot, at the\r\nglass-house. If all could not be joined in this way, it would still\r\nbe advantageous to unite thus the receiver, and the exterior bell\r\nglass. The interior bell and tube might then be fastened together,\r\nby grinding or luting. As yet I have only used lutings of waxed\r\ncloth, or cork. It may be proper to point out, that 3 or more\r\nconcentric bell glasses, and 4 or more jars, might be used. The\r\nunion of the bells, receiver, and tube once effected, it is hardly\r\nmore troublesome to use 3 than 2. When the fluid in the central jar\r\nis saturated, this may be emptied and replenished from the middle\r\njar, the latter from the external one. Then supplying the external\r\njar anew, the process may be continued.\r\n\r\nThe other figures are to explain an apparatus on the same\r\nprinciple, constructed of hollow, oblong paralellopipeds, differing\r\nin length more than in breadth; so as to allow a serpentine tube to\r\nwind into the interior, and deliver gas under a vessel shaped like\r\na T.\r\n\r\nFig. 2. represents a vertical section of the whole as when situated\r\nfor use.[74]\r\n\r\nFig. 3. a vertical section of the lower vessels only.\r\n\r\nFig. 4. a vertical section of the covers alone.\r\n\r\nFig. 5. a horizontal section, or ground plan of the lower vessels.\r\nThe upper vessels are so proportioned as to divide the distances\r\nbetween the lower ones equally.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to mention, that this apparatus, from the facility\r\nwith which it may be cleaned and inspected internally, admits of\r\nbeing made of porcelain or stone ware.[75] I have had a cylindrical\r\none constructed of the latter material, in which the covers are\r\nin one piece, with a tube in the centre for introducing gas. The\r\napparatus may be made more efficacious, by drilling a series of\r\nsmall holes round the brims of the bell glasses or covers, so as to\r\ncause the gas, instead of passing round the brims in large bubbles,\r\nto divide itself into very small ones. By this means it will be\r\nmore thoroughly intermingled with fluid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XIX. _A New Theory of Galvanism, supported by some Experiments\r\nand Observations made by means of the Calorimotor, a new Galvanic\r\nInstrument. Read before the Academy of Natural Sciences,\r\nPhiladelphia,[76] by_ ROBERT HARE, M. D. _Professor of Chemistry\r\nin the Medical Department of the University of Pennsylvania, and\r\nMember of several Learned Societies_.\r\n\r\n(With an Engraving.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI have for some time been of opinion that the principle extricated\r\nby the Voltaic pile is a compound of caloric and electricity, both\r\nbeing original and collateral products of Galvanic action.\r\n\r\nThe grounds of this conviction and some recent experiments\r\nconfirming it, are stated in the following paper.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that heat is liberated by the Voltaic apparatus,\r\nin a manner and degree which has not been imitated by means of\r\nmechanical electricity; and that the latter, while it strikes at a\r\ngreater distance, and pervades conductors with much greater speed,\r\ncan with difficulty be made to effect the slightest decompositions.\r\nWollaston, it is true, decomposed water by means of it; but the\r\nexperiment was performed of necessity on a scale too minute to\r\npermit of his ascertaining, whether there were any divellent polar\r\nattractions exercised towards the atoms, as in the case of the\r\npile. The result was probably caused by mechanical concussion, or\r\nthat process by which the particles of matter are dispersed when\r\na battery is discharged through them. The opinion of Dr. Thomson,\r\nthat the fluid of the pile is in quantity greater, in intensity\r\nless, than that evolved by the machine, is very inconsistent with\r\nthe experiments of the chemist above mentioned, who, before he\r\ncould effect the separation of the elements of water by mechanical\r\nelectricity, was obliged to confine its emission to a point\r\nimperceptible to the naked eye. If already so highly intense,\r\nwherefore the necessity of a further concentration? Besides, were\r\nthe distinction made by Dr. Thomson correct, the more concentrated\r\nfluid generated by a galvanic apparatus of a great many small\r\npairs, ought most to resemble that of the ordinary electricity;\r\nbut the opposite is the case. The ignition produced by a few\r\nlarge Galvanic plates, where the intensity is of course low,\r\nis a result most analogous to the chemical effects of a common\r\nelectrical battery. According to my view, caloric and electricity\r\nmay be distinguished by the following characteristics. The former\r\npermeates all matter more or less, though with very different\r\ndegrees of facility. It radiates through air, with immeasurable\r\ncelerity, and distributing itself in the interior of bodies,\r\ncommunicates a reciprocally repellent power to atoms, but not to\r\nmasses. Electricity does not radiate in or through any matter; and\r\nwhile it pervades some bodies, as metals, with almost infinite\r\nvelocity; by others, it is so far from being conducted, that it can\r\nonly pass through them by a fracture or perforation. Distributing\r\nitself over surfaces only, it causes repulsion between masses, but\r\nnot between the particles of the same mass. The disposition of the\r\nlast-mentioned principle to get off by neighbouring conductors, and\r\nof the other to combine with the adjoining matter, or to escape by\r\nradiation, would prevent them from being collected at the positive\r\npole, if not in combination with each other. Were it not for a\r\nmodification of their properties, consequent to some such union,\r\nthey could not, in piles of thousands of pairs, be carried forward\r\nthrough the open air and moisture; the one so well calculated to\r\nconduct away electricity, the other so favourable to the radiation\r\nof caloric.\r\n\r\nPure electricity does not expand the slips of gold-leaf, between\r\nwhich it causes repulsion, nor does caloric cause any repulsion\r\nin the ignited masses which it expands. But as the compound fluid\r\nextricated by Galvanic action, which I shall call electro-caloric,\r\ndistributes itself through the interior of bodies, and is evidently\r\nproductive of corpuscular repulsion, it is in this respect more\r\nallied to caloric than to electricity.\r\n\r\nIt is true, that when common electricity causes the deflagration\r\nof metals, as by the discharge of a Leyden jar, it must be supposed\r\nto insinuate itself within them, and cause a reaction between\r\ntheir particles. But in this case, agreeably to my hypothesis, the\r\nelectric fluid combines with the latent caloric previously existing\r\nthere, and, adding to its repulsive agency, causes it to overpower\r\ncohesion.[77]\r\n\r\nSir Humphry Davy was so much at a loss to account for the continued\r\nignition of wire at the poles of a Voltaic apparatus, that he\r\nconsiders it an objection to the materiality of heat; since the\r\nwire could not be imagined to contain sufficient caloric to keep\r\nup the emission of this principle for an unlimited time. But if we\r\nconceive an accumulation of heat to accompany that of electricity\r\nthroughout the series, and to be propagated from one end to the\r\nother, the explanation of the phenomenon in question is attended by\r\nno difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Galvanic fluid on charcoal is very consistent\r\nwith my views, since, next to metals, it is one of the best\r\nconductors of electricity, and the worst of heat, and would\r\ntherefore arrest the last, and allow the other to pass on. Though\r\npeculiarly liable to intense ignition, when exposed between\r\nthe poles of the Voltaic apparatus, it seems to me it does not\r\ndisplay this characteristic with common electricity. According to\r\nSir Humphry Davy, when in connexion with the positive pole, and\r\ncommunicating by a platina wire with the negative pole, the latter\r\nis less heated than when, with respect to the poles, the situation\r\nof the wire and charcoal is reversed. The rationale is obvious:\r\ncharcoal, being a bad conductor, and a good radiator, prevents the\r\ngreater part of the heat from reaching the platina, when placed\r\nbetween it and the source whence the heat flows.\r\n\r\nI had observed that as the number of pairs in Volta's pile had\r\nbeen extended, and their size and the energy of the interposed\r\nagents lessened, the ratio of the electrical effects to those\r\nof heat had increased; till in De Luc's column they had become\r\ncompletely predominant; and, on the other hand, when the pairs were\r\nmade larger and fewer (as in Children's apparatus) the calorific\r\ninfluence had gained the ascendancy. I was led to go farther in\r\nthis way, and to examine whether one pair of plates of enormous\r\nsize, or what might be equivalent thereto, would not exhibit heat\r\nmore purely, and demonstrate it, equally with the electric fluid,\r\na primary product of Galvanic combinations. The elementary battery\r\nof Wollaston, though productive of an evanescent ignition, was too\r\nminute to allow him to make the observations which I had in view.\r\n\r\nTwenty copper and twenty zinc plates, about nineteen inches\r\nsquare, were supported vertically in a frame, the different metals\r\nalternating at one half inch distance from each other. All the\r\nplates of the same kind of metal were soldered to a common slip, so\r\nthat each set of homogeneous plates formed one continuous metallic\r\nsuperficies. When the copper and zinc surfaces, thus formed, are\r\nunited by an intervening wire, and the whole immerged in an acid,\r\nor aceto-saline solution, in a vessel devoid of partitions, the\r\nwire becomes intensely ignited; and when hydrogen is liberated\r\nit usually takes fire, producing a very beautiful undulating, or\r\ncoruscating flame.\r\n\r\nI am confident, that if Volta and the other investigators of\r\nGalvanism, instead of multiplying the pairs of Galvanic plates,\r\nhad sought to increase the effect by enlarging one pair as I have\r\ndone, (for I consider the copper and zinc surfaces as reduced to\r\ntwo by the connexion) the apparatus would have been considered\r\nas presenting a new mode of evolving heat, as a primary effect\r\nindependently of electrical influence. There is no other indication\r\nof electricity when wires from the two surfaces touch the tongue,\r\nthan a slight taste, such as is excited by small pieces of zinc and\r\nsilver laid on it and under it, and brought into contact with each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nIt was with a view of examining the effects of the proximity and\r\nalternation in the heterogeneous plates that I had them cut into\r\nseparate squares. By having them thus divided, I have been enabled\r\nto ascertain that when all of one kind of metal are ranged on one\r\nside of the frame, and all of the other kind on the other side of\r\nit, the effect is no greater than might be expected from one pair\r\nof plates.\r\n\r\nVolta, considering the changes consequent to his contrivance as\r\nthe effect of a movement in the electric fluid, called the process\r\nelectro-motion, and the plates producing it electro-motors. But\r\nthe phenomena show that the plates, as I have arranged them, are\r\ncalori-motors, or heat movers, and the effect calori-motion.\r\nThat this is a new view of the subject, may be inferred from the\r\nfollowing passage in Davy's Elements. That great chemist observes,\r\n\"When very small conducting surfaces are used for conveying very\r\nlarge quantities of electricity, they become ignited; and of the\r\ndifferent conductors that have been compared, charcoal is most\r\neasily heated by electrical discharges,[78] next iron, platina,\r\ngold, then copper, and lastly, zinc. The phenomena of electrical\r\nignition, whether taking place in gaseous, fluid, or solid\r\nbodies, always seem to be the result of a violent exertion of the\r\nelectrical attractive and repellent powers, which may be connected\r\nwith motions of the particles of the substances affected. That no\r\nsubtile fluid, such as the matter of heat has been imagined to be,\r\ncan be discharged from these substances, in consequence of the\r\neffect of the electricity, seems probable, from the circumstance,\r\nthat a wire of platina may be preserved in a state of intense\r\nignition in vacuo, by means of the Voltaic apparatus, for an\r\nunlimited time; and such a wire cannot be supposed to contain an\r\ninexhaustible quantity of subtile matter.\"\r\n\r\nBut I demand where are the repellent and attractive powers to\r\nwhich the ignition produced by the Calorimotor can be attributed?\r\nBesides, I would beg leave respectfully to inquire of this\r\nillustrious author, whence the necessity of considering the heat\r\nevolved under the circumstances alluded to as the effect of the\r\nelectrical fluid; or why we may not as well suppose the latter\r\nto be excited by the heat? It is evident, as he observes, that\r\na wire cannot be supposed to contain an inexhaustible supply of\r\nmatter however subtile; but wherefore may not one kind of subtile\r\nmatter be supplied to it from the apparatus as well as another;\r\nespecially, when to suppose such a supply is quite as inconsistent\r\nwith the characteristics of pure electricity, as with those of pure\r\ncaloric?\r\n\r\nIt is evident from Mr. Children's paper in the Annals of\r\nPhilosophy, on the subject of his large apparatus, that the\r\nignition produced by it was ascribed to electrical excitement.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of ascertaining the necessity of the alternation\r\nand proximity of the copper and zinc plates, it has been mentioned\r\nthat distinct square sheets were employed. The experiments have\r\nsince been repeated and found to succeed by Dr. Patterson and Mr.\r\nLukens, by means of two continuous sheets, one of zinc, the other\r\nof copper, wound into two concentric coils or spirals. This, though\r\nthe circumstance was not known to them, was the form I had myself\r\nproposed to adopt, and had suggested as convenient for a Galvanic\r\napparatus to several friends at the beginning of the winter;[79]\r\nthough the consideration above stated induced me to prefer for a\r\nfirst experiment a more manageable arrangement.\r\n\r\nSince writing the above, I find that when, in the apparatus of\r\ntwenty copper and twenty zinc plates, ten copper plates on one side\r\nare connected with ten zinc on the other, and a communication made\r\nbetween the remaining twenty by a piece of iron wire, about the\r\neighth of an inch in diameter, the wire enters into a vivid state\r\nof combustion on the immersion of the plates. Platina wire equal to\r\nNo. 18 (the largest I had at hand) is rapidly fused if substituted\r\nfor the iron.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement is equivalent to a battery of two large Galvanic\r\npairs; excepting that there is no insulation, all the plates being\r\nplunged in one vessel. I have usually separated the pairs by a\r\nboard, extending across the frame merely.\r\n\r\nIndeed, when the forty plates were successively associated in\r\npairs, of copper and zinc, though suspended in a fluid held in\r\na common recipient without partitions; there was considerable\r\nintensity of Galvanic action. This shows that, independently of\r\nany power of conducting electricity, there is some movement in the\r\nsolvent fluid which tends to carry forward the Galvanic principle\r\nfrom the copper to the zinc end of the series. I infer that\r\nelectro-caloric is communicated in this case by circulation, and\r\nthat in non-elastic fluids the same difficulty exists as to its\r\nretrocession from the positive to the negative end of the series,\r\nas is found in the downward passage of caloric through them.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be mentioned, that the connecting wire should be placed\r\nbetween the heterogeneous surfaces before their immersion, as the\r\nmost intense ignition takes place immediately afterward. If the\r\nconnexion be made after the plates are immersed, the effect is much\r\nless powerful; and sometimes after two or three immersions the\r\napparatus loses its power, though the action of the solvent should\r\nbecome in the interim much more violent. Without any change in the\r\nlatter, after the plates have been for some time suspended in the\r\nair, they regain their efficacy. I had observed in a Galvanic pile\r\nof three hundred pairs of two inches square, a like consequence\r\nresulting from a simultaneous immersion of the whole.[80] The bars\r\nholding the plates were balanced by weights, as window-sashes are,\r\nso that all the plates could be very quickly dipped. A platina\r\nwire, No. 18, was fused into a globule, while the evolution of\r\npotassium was demonstrated by a rose-coloured flame arising from\r\nsome potash which had been placed between the poles. The heat\r\nhowever diminished in a few seconds, though the greater extrication\r\nof hydrogen from the plates indicated a more intense chemical\r\naction.\r\n\r\nAgreeably to an observation of Dr. Patterson, electrical excitement\r\nmay be detected in the apparatus by the condensing electroscope;\r\nbut this is no more than what Volta observed to be the consequence\r\nof the contact of heterogeneous metals.\r\n\r\nThe thinnest piece of charcoal intercepts the calorific agent,\r\nwhatever it may be. In order to ascertain this, the inside of a\r\nhollow brass cylinder, having the internal diameter two inches,\r\nand the outside of another smaller cylinder of the same substance,\r\nwere made conical and correspondent, so that the greater would\r\ncontain the less, and leave an interstice of about one-sixteenth\r\nof an inch between them. This interstice was filled with wood, by\r\nplugging the larger cylinder with this material, and excavating the\r\nplug till it would permit the smaller brass cylinder to be driven\r\nin. The excavation and the fitting of the cylinders was performed\r\naccurately by means of a turning lathe. The wood in the interstice\r\nwas then charred by exposing the whole covered by sand in a\r\ncrucible to a red heat. The charcoal, notwithstanding the shrinkage\r\nconsequent to the fire, was brought into complete contact with\r\nthe inclosing metallic surfaces by pressing the interior cylinder\r\nfurther into the exterior one.\r\n\r\nThus prepared, the interior cylinder being made to touch one of\r\nthe Galvanic surfaces, a wire brought from the other Galvanic\r\nsurface into contact with the outside cylinder, was not affected in\r\nthe least, though the slightest touch of the interior one caused\r\nignition. The contact of the charcoal with the containing metals\r\nprobably took place throughout a superficies of four square inches,\r\nand the wire was not much more than the hundredth part of an inch\r\nthick, so that unless it were to conduct electricity about forty\r\nthousand times better than the charcoal, it ought to have been\r\nheated; if the calorific influence of this apparatus result from\r\nelectrical excitement.\r\n\r\nI am led finally to suppose, that the contact of dissimilar metals,\r\nwhen subjected to the action of solvents, causes a movement in\r\ncaloric as well as in the electric fluid, and that the phenomena\r\nof Galvanism, the unlimited evolution of heat by friction, the\r\nextrication of gaseous matter without the production of cold,\r\nmight all be explained by supposing a combination between the\r\nfluids of heat and electricity. We find scarcely any two kinds\r\nof ponderable matter which do not exercise more or less affinity\r\ntowards each other. Moreover, imponderable particles are supposed\r\nhighly attractive of ponderable ones. Why then should we not infer\r\nthe existence of similar affinities between imponderable particles\r\nreciprocally? That a peculiar combination between heat and light\r\nexists in the solar beams, is evident from their not imparting\r\nwarmth to a lens through which they may pass, as do those of our\r\nculinary fires.\r\n\r\nUnder this view of the case, the action of the poles in Galvanic\r\ndecomposition is one of complex affinity. The particles of\r\ncompounds are attracted to the different wires agreeably to their\r\nsusceptibilities to the positive and negative attraction, and the\r\ncaloric leaving the electric fluid with which it had been combined,\r\nunites with them at the moment that their electric state is\r\nneutralized.\r\n\r\nAs an exciting fluid, I have usually employed a solution of one\r\npart sulphuric acid, and two parts muriate of soda with seventy of\r\nwater; but, to my surprise, I have produced nearly a white heat by\r\nan alkaline solution barely sensible to the taste.\r\n\r\nFor the display of the heat effects, the addition of manganese, red\r\nlead, or the nitrates, is advantageous.\r\n\r\nThe rationale is obvious. The oxygen of these substances prevents\r\nthe liberation of the gaseous hydrogen, which would carry off the\r\ncaloric. Adding to diluted muriatic acid, while acting on zinc,\r\nenough red lead to prevent effervescence, the temperature rose from\r\n70 to 110 Fahrenheit.\r\n\r\nThe power of the calorimotor is much increased by having the\r\ncommunication between the different sheets formed by very large\r\nstrips or masses of metal. Observing this, I rendered the sheets\r\nof copper shorter by half an inch, for a distance of four inches\r\nof their edges, where the communication was to be made between the\r\nzinc sheets; and, vice versa, the zinc was made in the same way\r\nshorter than the copper sheets where these were to communicate with\r\neach other. The edges of the shortened sheets being defended by\r\nstrips of wood, tin was cast on the intermediate protruding edges\r\nof the longer ones, so as to embrace a portion of each equal to\r\nabout one quarter of an inch by four inches. On one side, the tin\r\nwas made to run completely across, connecting at the same time\r\nten copper and ten zinc sheets. On the other side there was an\r\ninterstice of above a quarter of an inch left between the stratum\r\nof tin embracing the copper, and that embracing the zinc plates.\r\nOn each of the approaching terminations of the connecting tin\r\nstrata was soldered a kind of forceps, formed of a bent piece of\r\nsheet brass, furnished with a screw for pressing the jaws together.\r\nThe distance between the different forceps was about two inches.\r\nThe advantage of a very close contact was made very evident by the\r\naction of the screws; the relaxation or increase of pressure on the\r\nconnecting wire by turning them being productive of a correspondent\r\nchange in the intensity of ignition.\r\n\r\nIt now remains to state, that by means of iron ignited in this\r\napparatus, a fixed alkali may be decomposed extemporaneously.[81]\r\nIf a connecting iron wire, while in combustion, be touched by the\r\nhydrate of potash, the evolution of potassium is demonstrated by\r\na rose-coloured flame. The alkali may be applied to the wire in\r\nsmall pieces in a flat hook of sheet iron. But the best mode of\r\napplication is by means of a tray made by doubling a slip of sheet\r\niron at the ends, and leaving a receptacle in the centre, in which\r\nthe potash may be placed covered with filings. This tray being\r\nsubstituted for the connecting wire, as soon as the immersion of\r\nthe apparatus causes the metal to burn, the rose-coloured flame\r\nappears, and if the residuum left in the sheet iron be afterward\r\nthrown into water, an effervescence sometimes ensues.\r\n\r\nI have ascertained that an iron heated to combustion, by a\r\nblacksmith's forge fire, will cause the decomposition of the\r\nhydrate of potash.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the Calorimotor may be much reduced without\r\nproportionably diminishing the effect. I have one of sixty plates\r\nwithin a cubic foot, which burns off No. 16, iron wire. A good\r\nworkman could get 120 plates of a foot square within a hollow cube\r\nof a size no larger. But the inflammation of the hydrogen which\r\ngives so much splendour to the experiment, can only be exhibited\r\nadvantageously on a large scale.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CALORIMETER\r\n\r\n _Fig. 1._\r\n\r\n_Fig. 2._\r\n\r\n_Fig. 3._\r\n\r\n_Fig. 4._\r\n\r\n_Drawn & Engraved by Kneass, Young & Co._]\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF THE PLATE.\r\n\r\nA _a_, Fig. 1st, two cubical vessels, 20 inches square, inside.\r\n_b b b b_ a frame of wood containing 20 sheets of copper, and 20\r\nsheets of zinc, alternating with each other, and about half an\r\ninch apart. T T _t t_ masses of tin cast over the protruding edges\r\nof the sheets which are to communicate with each other. Fig. 2,\r\nrepresents the mode in which the junction between the various\r\nsheets and tin masses is effected. Between the letters _z z_, the\r\nzinc only is in contact with the tin masses. Between _c c_ the\r\ncopper alone touches. It may be observed, that, at the back of\r\nthe frame, ten sheets of copper between _c c_, and ten sheets of\r\nzinc between _z z_, are made to communicate, by a common mass of\r\ntin extending the whole length of the frame, between T T: but in\r\nfront, as in fig. 1, there is an interstice between the mass of\r\ntin connecting the ten copper sheets, and that connecting the ten\r\nzinc sheets. The screw forceps, appertaining to each of the tin\r\nmasses, may be seen on either side of the interstice: and likewise\r\na wire for ignition held between them. The application of the rope,\r\npulley, and weights, is obvious. The swivel at S permits the frame\r\nto be swung round and lowered into water in the vessel _a_, to wash\r\noff the acid, which, after immersion in the other vessel, might\r\ncontinue to act on the sheets, encrusting them with oxide. Between\r\n_p p_ there is a wooden partition which is not necessary, though it\r\nmay be beneficial.\r\n\r\nFig. 3, represents an apparatus alluded to, page 419. It consists\r\nof a couronne des tasses, reduced to a form no less compact\r\nthan that of the trough. Hollow parallelopipeds of glass are\r\nsubstituted for tumblers or cells. The plates are suspended to bars\r\ncounterpoised like window-sashes.\r\n\r\nThe advantages are as follows. The material is one of the best\r\nnon-conductors, is easily cleansed, and is the most impervious to\r\nsolvents. The fracture of one of the cups is easily remedied by\r\na supernumerary. They may be procured (as in the United States)\r\nwhere porcelain cannot be had. The shock from 300 pairs is such as\r\nfew will take a second time. Some of the effects have already been\r\nstated.[82]\r\n\r\nAt Fig. 4, one of the hollow glass parallelopipeds on an enlarged\r\nscale is represented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMATHEMATICS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XX. _An improved Method of obtaining the Formulæ for the Sines\r\nand Cosines of the Sum and Difference of two Arcs, by_ PROFESSOR\r\nSTRONG, _of Hamilton College_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the circle ABCD let AB and BC denote any two arcs contiguous\r\nto each other. Draw their limiting diameters A_a_, C_c_; their\r\nsines B_x_, B_y_; and join _x_, _y_. Then will _xy_ = sine of (AB\r\n+ BC): for if upon OB as a diameter we describe a circle, it will\r\nmanifestly pass through the points _x_ and _y_, (since the angles\r\nO_x_B, O_y_B are right, see Euc. 31. 3.) therefore O_x_B_y_ is a\r\nquadrilateral inscribed in a circle described on OB as a diameter,\r\nand the angle _y_O_x_ at the circumference stands upon an arc\r\nwhose chord is _xy_. Again, if from _a_ we draw _ad_ perpendicular\r\nto C_c_, it will be the sine of the arc _ac_ (= AB + BC). If now\r\nwe describe a circle on _a_O as diameter, it will pass through\r\n_d_, (see Euc. 31. 3.) therefore _ad_ is the chord of an arc on\r\nwhich the angle _a_O_c_ stands in the circle described on _a_O.\r\nBut in equal circles the chords of arcs on which equal angles at\r\nthe centres or circumferences stand are equal; (see Euc. 26. and\r\n29. 3.) hence _xy_ = _ad_ = sin(AB + BC). Now sine O_x_B_y_ is a\r\nquadrilateral inscribed in the circle described on OB as diameter,\r\nwe shall have (Euc. D. 6.)\r\n\r\n  OB · xy = Bx · Oy + By · Ox = sinAB · cosCB + sinCB · cosAB.\r\n\r\n  If OB be denoted by r, we shall have xy, or\r\n\r\n  sin(AB + BC) = (sinAB · cosCB + sinCB · cosAB)/r.\r\n\r\n  If AB = A, BC = B, and the radius r = 1,\r\n\r\n  sin(A + B) = sinA · CosB + sinB · cosA;\r\n\r\nwhich is the known formula for the sine of the sum of two arcs, to\r\nthe radius 1.\r\n\r\nAgain, if through O we draw the diameter DE perpendicular to A_a_,\r\nthen will DC be the complement of (AB + BC). Draw C_p_, the sine of\r\nDC = cos(AB + BC). Through B draw the diameter B_b_; from _b_, draw\r\nthe sines _bz_, _br_, of the arcs _bc_, _b_E respectively, and join\r\n_z_, _r_. Then by describing two circles, one on _b_O as diameter,\r\nthe other on OC, it may be proved as before that the circle\r\ndescribed on _b_O passes through the points _z_ and _r_, and that\r\nthe circle described on CO passes through _p_: and hence, by the\r\nsame reasoning as before, _zr_ = C_p_ = cos(AB + BC). Now O_bzr_\r\nbeing a quadrilateral inscribed in the circle described on _b_O, we\r\nhave (by the prop. before cited)\r\n\r\n  bO · zr + Or · bz = br · Oz;\r\n\r\n  and hence bO · zr = br · Oz - Or · bz.\r\n\r\nBut _br_ = sine arc _b_E = sine arc BD; and since BD is the\r\ncomplement of AB, _br_ = cosAB. In like manner O_z_ = cosBC, O_r_ =\r\nsinAB, and _bz_ = sinBC; hence by substitution,\r\n\r\n  bO · zr = cosAB · cosBC - sinAB · sinBC.\r\n\r\n  By using the same notation as before, we have\r\n\r\n  cos(A + B) = (cosA · cosB - sinA · sinB)/r\r\n             = (if r = 1) cosA · cosB - sinA · sinB,\r\n\r\nwhich is the known formula for the cosine of the sum of two arcs.\r\n\r\nThe same construction will answer for the two remaining cases: for\r\nif we suppose that _b_E and _bc_ are two arcs, then will _c_E be\r\ntheir difference, and _zr_ the sine of _c_E, as proved above; hence\r\n\r\n  zr (= sin(bE - bc)) =  (br · Oz - Or · bz)/bO.\r\n\r\nBut _br_ = sin_b_E, and O_r_ = its cosine; and _bz_ = sine _bc_,\r\nand O_z_ = its cos., hence if _b_E be denoted by _a_, _bc_ by _b_,\r\nand O_b_ as before, then will\r\n\r\n  sin(a - b) = (sina · cosb - sinb · cosa)/r\r\n             = (if r = 1) sina · cosb - sinb · cosa.\r\n\r\nAgain, AB + BC is the complement of DC or _c_E; hence by the first\r\npart of the above investigation,\r\n\r\n  xy = sin(AB + BC) = coscE:\r\n\r\n  but xy or sin(A + B) = cos(a - b) = (sinA · cosB + sinB · cosA)/r;\r\n\r\nand as sinA or AB = cosBD = cos_b_E, O_x_ = cosA or AB = sinBD =\r\nsin_b_E, B_y_ = _bz_ = sin_bc_, and O_y_ = O_z_ = cos_bc_, we\r\nshall have, by substitution,\r\n\r\n  cos(a - b) = (cosa · cosb + sina · sinb)/r,\r\n             = (if r = 1) cosa · cosb + sina · sinb.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said it appears, that if A and B be any two\r\narcs, of which A is the greatest, then\r\n\r\n  Sin(A ± B) = (sinA · cosB ± sinB · cosA)/r;\r\n\r\n  Cos(A ± B) = (cosA · cosB ∓ sinA · sinB)/r.\r\n\r\nWhen the radius _r_ is supposed = 1, the denominators in these\r\nformulæ disappear. In the latter, A and B are used for _a_ and _b_,\r\nfor the sake of homogeneity. The propriety of this is manifest; for\r\nas _a_ and _b_ denote two indefinite arcs, the same reasoning will\r\napply to A and B, as to _a_ and _b_, the first being supposed in\r\neach case the greatest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following Diophantine Problem was proposed for solution\r\nsome months ago in a Periodical Journal, which has since been\r\ndiscontinued. To those who are interested in speculations of this\r\nnature, we presume that the following solution, forwarded by\r\nProfessor STRONG, of Hamilton College, will not be unacceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBLEM.\r\n\r\n_To find three positive rational Numbers, x, y, and z, such that\r\nx^2 - y, x^2 - z, y^2 - x, and y^2 - z may all be squares._\r\n\r\n  Assume x - ay for the root of the square x^2 - y:\r\n\r\n  then x^2 - y = (x - ay)^2, whence x = (a^2y + 1)/2a.\r\n\r\n  In like manner, by assuming x - bz for the root of the square x^2 - z,\r\n\r\n  we find z = (2bx - 1)/b^2.\r\n\r\n  But y^2 - x = y^2 - (a^2y + 1)/2a, (since x = (a^2y + 1)/2a);\r\n\r\n  and as this is to be made a square, assume y - c((a^2y + 1)/2a)\r\n  for its root; whence, by proceeding as before, we find\r\n\r\n  y = (2a + c^2)/(4ca - a^2c^2).\r\n\r\n  But x = (a^2y + 1)/2a = (by substituting for y its value)\r\n\r\n  (a^2 + 2c)/(4ca - c^2a^2).\r\n\r\n  Again z = (2bx - 1)/b^2 = (by substituting for x its value)\r\n\r\n  [2b((a^2 + 2c)/(4ca - c^2a^2)) - 1]/b^2; hence\r\n\r\n  y^2 - z = [((2a + c^2)/(4ca - c^2a^2))^2 × b^2\r\n  - 2b((a^2 + 2c)/(4ca - c^2a^2)) + 1]/b^2\r\n\r\n  (by substituting for y and z their values;) and as this also is\r\n  to be made a square, assume for its root (be - 1)/b. Then we shall have\r\n\r\n  ((2a + c^2)/(4ca - c^2a^2))^2 × b^2\r\n  - 2b((a^2 + 2c)/(4ca - c^2a^2)) + 1 = (be - 1)^2;\r\n\r\n  from which, by reduction,\r\n\r\n\r\n  b = 2 × [e(4ca - c^2a^2)^2 - (a^2 + 2c)(4ca - c^2a^2)]\r\n        / [e^2(4ca - c^2a^2)^2 - (2a + c^2)^2].\r\n\r\n  Hence the values of the required numbers are as follows:\r\n\r\n  z = (2bx - 1)/b^2,\r\n  (in which the value of b is to be found from the last equation,)\r\n\r\n  x = (a^2 + 2c)/(4ca - c^2a^2), and\r\n\r\n  y = (2a + c^2)/(4ca - c^2a^2).\r\n\r\nThe numbers _a_, _c_, and _e_, are to be so assumed that _x_, _y_,\r\nand _z_ may come out positive. If _a_ = 1, _c_ = 2, and _e_ = 2,\r\nthen will _x_ = 5/4, _y_ = 3/2, and _z_ = 14/9, which numbers\r\nwill be found upon trial to satisfy the question. It may also be\r\nobserved that _c_ and _a_ being positive, _ca_ must not exceed 4;\r\nbut the form of the above expressions for _x_, _y_, _z_, will be\r\nsufficient to direct us how _a_, _c_, and _e_, are to be assumed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XXI. _An Account of several Ancient Mounds, and of two Caves,\r\nin East Tennessee, by_ MR. JOHN HENRY KAIN, _of Knoxville_.\r\n\r\n(Communicated for the American Journal of Science, &c.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mounds._\r\n\r\nOn the plantation of Mr. John Kain of Knox county, near the north\r\nbank of the Holston River, 5 miles above its junction with the\r\nFrench Broad, is a curious collection of mounds of earth, evidently\r\nthe work of art, but of an almost antediluvian antiquity, if we may\r\nform any conjecture of their age, from that of the forest which\r\ngrows around and upon them. They are about half a dozen in number,\r\nand arise on about half an acre of level ground without any seeming\r\nregularity. They are pyramidal in their shape, or rather sections\r\nof pyramids, whose bases are from 10 to 30 paces in diameter. The\r\nlargest one in this group rises about 10 feet above the level\r\nground, and is remarkably regular in its figure. A perpendicular\r\nsection of this mound was made about a year since, but no important\r\ndiscovery was made. It was found to consist of the surface thrown\r\nup, and contained a good deal of ashes and charcoal.\r\n\r\nThis group of mounds is surrounded by a ditch, which can be\r\ndistinctly traced on three sides, and enclosing besides the mounds,\r\nseveral acres of ground. It is like the mounds covered with trees,\r\nwhich grow in it and about it. At every angle of this ditch, it\r\nsweeps out into a semicircle, and it appears in many respects well\r\ncalculated for defence.\r\n\r\nThere are many other mounds of the same form in Tennessee. At the\r\njunction of the French Broad with the Holston, there is one in\r\nwhich human bones are said to have been found. Farther up French\r\nBroad, near Newport, is a very large mound. It reposes on a very\r\nlevel and extensive plain, and is itself the largest I ever saw. It\r\nis thirty feet high, and its base covers half an acre of ground.\r\nAs it ascends from its base, there is a slight inclination from\r\na perpendicular on all sides, and the upper surface is as level\r\nas the rest is regular. From the great size of this mound, its\r\ncommanding situation, and the mystery which veils its history, it\r\nis a most interesting spot of ground. There are many other mounds\r\nof this description in the State of Tennessee, but I have not\r\nvisited them.\r\n\r\nThough not immediately connected with this subject, I take the\r\nliberty to subjoin an account of a remarkable cave or grotto, in\r\na bluff of limestone, on the south bank of the Holston River,\r\nopposite the mounds first described. The bluff is perhaps 100 feet\r\nhigh and 50 wide. The grotto is a large natural excavation of the\r\nrock, 60 feet high and 30 feet wide. It is very irregular, and to\r\nthe very top bears marks of the attrition of waves. The river to\r\nhave been so high, must have covered the valley through which it\r\nnow winds its quiet way. The excavation gradually diminishes in\r\nsize as you proceed backward, till at 100 feet from the entrance,\r\nit terminates. A remarkable projection of the rock divides the\r\nback part into two stories. This grotto, whose walls are hung with\r\nivy, and the bluff crowned with cedars, and surrounded by an aged\r\nforest, on which the vine clambers most luxuriantly, viewed from\r\nthe river which winds slowly around it, and reflects its image, is\r\nmore than beautiful: it is even venerable. But what renders it most\r\ninteresting to many visitors, is a number of rude paintings, which\r\nwere, as tradition reports, left on it by the Cherokee Indians.\r\nThese Indians are known to have made this cave a resting-place,\r\nas they passed up and down the River Holston. These paintings\r\nare still distinct, though they have faded somewhat within my\r\nremembrance. They consist of representations of the sun and moon,\r\nof a man, of birds, fishes, &c. They are all of red paint, and\r\nresemble in this respect, the paintings on Paint Rock near the warm\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nMuch has been said of the objects of curiosity in the country\r\nnorth of us; and I took the liberty to describe some of them in\r\nmy preceding communication. Indeed we may say, without danger of\r\nexaggeration, that the range of Alleghany Mountains presents a\r\nvariety of the most curious features, and many objects of beauty\r\nand sublimity. I have noticed a few of the most prominent, but \"the\r\nhalf is not told.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extract of a Letter, &c._\r\n\r\n  _Knoxville, Nov. 24, 1818._\r\n\r\nI was on a visit to a friend a few days since, about 30 miles to\r\nthe north of this, and was invited by him to visit an interesting\r\ncuriosity in the neighbourhood. We crossed the Clynch River where\r\nit is much confined by mountains, and banks as high as mountains.\r\nOur guide conducted us to the foot of a steep declivity, where we\r\nleft our horses, and with some difficulty ascended about 70 yards.\r\nHere we came to the mouth of a cave which had been stopped up by a\r\nstone wall. The wall was made of limestone and mortar, which is now\r\nharder than the stone itself. It is, without a doubt, artificial,\r\nfor besides the evidence afforded by its structure, it contains\r\nbones and animal remains.\r\n\r\nWhat was this wall built for? There was a tradition among\r\nthe inhabitants that it contained money, and they were much\r\ndisappointed on opening it, not to find any. Like other caves,\r\nit contains a variety of calcareous concretions, and I obtained\r\nsome fine specimens of brown spar, which I will take the first\r\nopportunity to send you.\r\n\r\n  I remain your Friend,\r\n\r\n  JOHN H.

Some years ago a farmer of fair character, who resided in an\r\ninterior town in New England, sold his farm, with an intention of\r\npurchasing another in a different town. His mind was naturally\r\nof a melancholy cast. Shortly after the sale of his farm, he was\r\ninduced to believe that he had sold it for less than its value.\r\nThis persuasion brought on dissatisfaction, and eventually a\r\nconsiderable degree of melancholy. In this situation, one of his\r\nneighbours engaged him to enclose a lot of land, with a post and\r\nrail fence, which he was to commence making the next day. At the\r\ntime appointed he went into the field, and began with a beetle and\r\nwedges to split the timber, out of which the posts and rails were\r\nto be prepared. On finishing his day's work, he put his beetle and\r\nwedges into a hollow tree, and went home. Two of his sons had been\r\nat work through the day in a distant part of the same field. On\r\nhis return, he directed them to get up early the next morning, to\r\nassist him in making the fence. In the course of the evening he\r\nbecame delirious, and continued in this situation several years;\r\nwhen his mental powers were suddenly restored. The first question\r\nwhich he asked after the return of his reason, was, whether his\r\nsons had brought in the beetle and wedges. He appeared to be wholly\r\nunconscious of the time that had elapsed from the commencement of\r\nhis delirium. His sons, apprehensive that any explanations might\r\ninduce a return of his disease, simply replied that they had been\r\nunable to find them. He immediately arose from his bed, went into\r\nthe field where he had been at work a number of years before, and\r\nfound the wedges, and the rings of the beetle, where he had left\r\nthem, the beetle itself having mouldered away. During his delirium,\r\nhis mind had not been occupied with those subjects with which it\r\nwas conversant in health.\r\n\r\n2. Mrs. S., an intelligent lady, belonging to a respectable family\r\nin the State of New-York, some years ago undertook a piece of fine\r\nneedlework. She devoted her time to it almost constantly for a\r\nnumber of days. Before she had completed it, she became suddenly\r\ndelirious. In this state, without experiencing any material\r\nabatement of her disease, she continued for about seven years; when\r\nher reason was suddenly restored. One of the first questions which\r\nshe asked after her reason returned, related to her needlework.\r\nIt is a remarkable fact, that during the long continuance of her\r\ndelirium she said nothing, so far as was recollected, about her\r\nneedlework, nor concerning any such subjects as usually occupied\r\nher attention when in health.\r\n\r\n3. A lady in New England, of a respectable family, was for a\r\nconsiderable period subject to paroxysms of delirium. These\r\nparoxysms came on instantaneously, and after continuing an\r\nindefinite time, went off as suddenly; leaving her mind perfectly\r\nrational. It often happened that when she was engaged in rational\r\nand interesting conversation, she would stop short in the midst\r\nof it, become in a moment entirely delirious, and commence a\r\nconversation on some other subject, not having the remotest\r\nconnexion with the previous one, nor would she advert to that\r\nduring her delirium. When she became rational again, she would\r\npursue the same conversation in which she had been engaged during\r\nthe lucid interval, beginning where she had left off. To such a\r\ndegree was this carried, that she would complete an unfinished\r\nstory or sentence, or even an unfinished word. When her next\r\ndelirious paroxysm came on, she would continue the conversation\r\nwhich she had been pursuing in her preceding paroxysm; so that she\r\nappeared as a person might be supposed to do, who had two souls,\r\neach occasionally dormant, and occasionally active, and utterly\r\nignorant of what the other was doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTELLIGENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nART. XXIII. 1. _Discovery of American Cinnabar and Native Lead._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Extract of a letter from Dr. Comstock of Hartford, to the Editor._\r\n\r\n  SIR,\r\n\r\nIn answer to your inquiry concerning the discovery of sulphuret of\r\nmercury and native lead in this country, I send you the following\r\nsummary of a letter I received from B. F. Stickney, Esq. Indian\r\nagent, dated Fort Wayne, Dec. 1, 1818.\r\n\r\nMr. Stickney states, that the situation of Fort Wayne, and the\r\ncountry surrounding, is a high level, probably about 800 feet\r\nabove the sea. From this place the water-courses divide and take\r\ndifferent directions, on the one hand falling into the Gulf of\r\nMexico, and on the other into the Bay of St. Lawrence. The whole\r\ncountry is of secondary formation, chiefly calcareous and aluminous.\r\n\r\nBitumen and sulphur are every where to be found, and as usual,\r\naccompanied by the metals.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the cinnabar, his words are, \"I have found a black\r\nand garnet-coloured sand, in great abundance on the shores of\r\nthe Lakes Erie and Michigan, this is a sulphuret of mercury, and\r\nyields about sixty per cent. It is so easy to be obtained, and\r\nin so convenient a form for distillation, that it must become an\r\nimportant article of commerce.\"\r\n\r\nThe native lead was found on the Anglaize River, at a considerable\r\ndistance from the fort.\r\n\r\nOf this he says, \"metallic lead is so interspersed with galena, as\r\nto prove incontestably the existence of native lead.\"\r\n\r\n  Respectfully,\r\n\r\n  Your obedient Servant,\r\n\r\n  J. L. COMSTOCK.\r\n\r\n  _Hartford, Conn. Feb. 17, 1819._\r\n\r\n  _Benjamin Silliman, M. D., &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n2. _Theoretical views of Professor Hare of Philadelphia._\r\n\r\nWe are authorized to mention, that Dr. Robert Hare has taught in\r\nhis lectures during the last eighteen months, that acid properties\r\nnever appearing in the absence of water, this fluid or its elements\r\nare most entitled to be considered as the acidifying principle:\r\nbut that probably it does not exist in acids as water, but is\r\ndecomposed when added to them, the particles of hydrogen and oxygen\r\nby their different polarities taking opposite sides of those\r\ncomposing the base. The extrication of hydrogen by the action of\r\ndiluted sulphuric acid on iron or zinc, being the consequence of\r\na previous, not simultaneous decomposition of water. Hence when\r\nsulphuric or nitric acids are so concentrated as to char or ignite,\r\nthey are not acids really.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _New Work on Chemistry._\r\n\r\nDr. John Gorham of Boston, Professor of Chemistry in Harvard\r\nUniversity, &c. has published the first volume of his Elements of\r\nChemical Science. The work will be comprised in two volumes, and\r\nits completion will be anticipated with interest by the scientific\r\npublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. _Botanical._\r\n\r\nDr. Romer of Zurich, has begun, since 1815, to publish a new\r\nedition of the Systema Vegetabilium of Linnæus; he proceeds in its\r\npublication; it will form several volumes.\r\n\r\nRobert Brown of London, is endeavouring to group the natural orders\r\nof plants into natural classes, or rather into larger natural\r\norders, with determinate characters: he has communicated some parts\r\nof his labour to the botanists of Paris. He has been the first to\r\nemploy as a new character in the distinction of natural orders, the\r\nestivation of flowers, or the manner in which they are folded in\r\nthe buds.\r\n\r\nC. S. Rafinesque, in his Analysis of Nature, has adopted a new\r\npractice, that of giving single substantive Latin names to the\r\nnatural orders and families of plants.\r\n\r\nMirbel has proposed a new nomenclature of fruits in his Elements of\r\nBotany.\r\n\r\nDecandolle, after publishing the principles of the science in\r\nhis Theory of Botany, has begun to undertake a general species\r\nplantarum, according to the natural classification.\r\n\r\nThree splendid Floras of the south of Europe have been undertaken.\r\n1. Flora Græca, by Sibthorp and Smith in England. 2. Flora\r\nLusitanica, by Link and Hoffmansegg in Germany. 3. Flora\r\nNepolitana, by Tenore in Naples. They are very expensive works, and\r\nare not yet terminated. _Received in January, 1819._\r\n\r\n\r\n5. _Staurotide._\r\n\r\n  Extract of a letter to the Editor, from John Torrey, M.D., of\r\n  New-York.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Pierce and myself lately found staurotide on the island of\r\nNew-York. It occurs in considerable quantity in a rock of _mica\r\nslate_, on the banks of the Hudson, about three and a half miles\r\nfrom the city. The crystals very seldom form the perfect cross,\r\nthough many were found, intersecting each other imperfectly at\r\nangles of 60°. Several single crystals were obtained exceedingly\r\nperfect. They were short 4-sided prisms, with the acute lateral\r\nedges truncated at each extremity on the two solid angles of\r\nthe most obtuse lateral edges, forming diedral terminations at\r\neach extremity of the prism. The faces of these terminations were\r\ninclined to each other at an angle of 67° and a few minutes. The\r\nannexed figure shows the form of the crystal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n6. _Supplement to the \"Remarks on the Geology and Mineralogy of a\r\nSection of Massachusetts, on Connecticut River, &c.\" contained in\r\nNo. 2, Art. I, of this Journal, by_ E. HITCHCOCK, A. M.\r\n\r\nThe following minerals, found in the region above named, were\r\neither omitted in the former list, or have been noticed since that\r\nwas made out.\r\n\r\n  _Bog-iron Ore._ In Greenfield and Warwick.\r\n\r\n  _Hornstone._ Rare; in Deerfield and Conway.\r\n\r\n  _Silicious Slate._ In rolled pieces, on the banks of Deerfield\r\n  river; not abundant.\r\n\r\n  _Basanite_, or _Lydian Stone_. Same locality.\r\n\r\n  _Augite._ In an aggregate of greenstone, quartz, and calcareous\r\n  spar, in the greenstone range, Deerfield. Colour black, and the\r\n  crystals usually imperfect, or broken.\r\n\r\n  _Staurotide._ In mica slate, Northfield, one mile east of the\r\n  village, on the turnpike to Boston. The crystals observed were\r\n  six-sided prisms. The same rock contains reddish garnets.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LEVERETT RANGE OF GRANITE.\r\n\r\nThis name is given to a granite range that emerges from the\r\npuddingstone near the centre of Amherst, and extends northerly,\r\nwith some interruption, nearly thirty miles, through Leverett\r\nand Montague to Northfield. And, indeed, there is some reason to\r\nsuppose that it again appears to the north of Northfield. The range\r\nis widest in Leverett, where its breadth is more than a mile. It\r\nis noticed in the \"Remarks,\" No. 2, Art. I, of this Journal, and\r\nmay be seen on the section accompanying that communication. But on\r\nfurther examination it has been found to be more extensive than was\r\nsupposed. The texture of the rock is coarse. Plates of mica, 3 or\r\n4 inches across, are common in it; and one specimen of a beautiful\r\nblue feldspar, the fragment only of a crystal, measured in one\r\ndirection 8 inches.\r\n\r\nTwo circumstances in this range give it an interest in the eye of a\r\ngeologist. The one is its proximity to sandstone and puddingstone;\r\nand the other, its small elevation in comparison with the\r\nsurrounding rocks of later formations. In some places no other rock\r\ncould be found lying between the granite and puddingstone; though\r\nthe soil prevented my observing whether there is an actual contact.\r\nBut in general there is a stratum of mica slate a few rods wide\r\nbetween these rocks, and not unfrequently gneiss lies between the\r\nmica slate and granite.\r\n\r\nStanding on this range in Leverett, you have on the west, at\r\nabout 100 rods distant, a precipitous mountain of sandstone and\r\npuddingstone, five or six hundred feet higher than the granite. On\r\nthe east, a mile or two distant, a mountain of sienite gradually\r\nrises to a still greater height than the puddingstone; and on the\r\nsouthwest, at nearly the same distance, you can see an alluvial\r\nformation. In general this granite does not rise so high as the\r\nadjacent rocks, whether secondary or primitive.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEINS OF ORE IN THIS GRANITE.\r\n\r\n1. _Of Galena in Leverett._\r\n\r\nThis ore forms a narrow vein in the southwest part of the town,\r\non land of Moses Smith, two miles from the Congregational\r\nmeeting-house. The direction of the vein is nearly north and south,\r\nand where I saw it, only a foot wide. The gangue is sulphate of\r\nbarytes.\r\n\r\n2. _Of Galena, Copper Pyrites, and Blende._\r\n\r\nThis vein is a little more than a mile north of the one above\r\ndescribed, and it may be a continuation of the same vein. The\r\ngangue is nearly an equal admixture of sulphate of barytes and\r\nquartz; and galena and sulphuret of copper are disseminated through\r\nit in about the same, that is, equal proportions. The blende, which\r\nis of a yellowish aspect when the fractured crystal is held in a\r\ncertain position, appears only occasionally. This vein is several\r\nfeet wide, has been wrought to a small extent in two places, and\r\nits direction is nearly north and south. It is on land of Mr. Field.\r\n\r\n_Radiated quartz._ In the above vein. A considerable tendency to\r\ncrystallization appears at this place, not only in the quartz, but\r\nin the foliated structure of the barytes.\r\n\r\n_Brown spar._ In the same place. But little of this mineral was\r\nnoticed. It exfoliated before the blowpipe, turned black, and\r\nbecame magnetic.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. _Of Specular Oxide of Iron in Montague._\r\n\r\nThis is found in a partially detached eminence, 100 feet high, near\r\nthe north line of Montague, on land of Mr. Taft, a little southwest\r\nfrom the confluence of Miller's river with the Connecticut. The\r\nwhole hill, not less than 100 rods in circumference at its base, is\r\ntraversed by numerous veins of this ore; and scarcely a foot of the\r\nrock is to be seen that does not contain these, varying in width\r\nfrom a mere line to several inches. The principal vein appears on\r\nthe top of the hill; and is, as nearly as I could determine, not\r\nless than ten feet wide, lying in a north and south direction. The\r\nore seems to be abundant, and generally pure. Masses, that have\r\nbeen separated by blasting, and weighing from 100 to 200 pounds,\r\nlie on the surface. A small proportion of sulphuret of iron was\r\nobserved in some specimens. The gangue is quartz, and the walls and\r\nhill granite.\r\n\r\nNo opinion is here intended to be offered concerning the probable\r\nvalue of these ores, if worked. If they be useless to the present\r\ngeneration, they may not be so to some future one, when labour\r\nshall be cheaper; and therefore it was thought to be of some\r\nconsequence to point out their localities.\r\n\r\nIn the remarks, to which this paper is a supplement, _blue quartz_\r\nwas inadvertently put down among the minerals found in Deerfield.\r\nI presume it does not exist there. It is also probable that the\r\nvariety of garnets found in Conway, is not, as formerly stated, the\r\nmelanite.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. _New Process for Tanning._\r\n\r\nA process for effecting the tanning of leather in a neat,\r\nexpeditious, and thorough manner, has been discovered by a Mr.\r\nSteel, of Connecticut: some account of it may be given hereafter.\r\n\r\n\r\n8. _Connexion between Chemistry and Medicine._\r\n\r\nThis subject has been discussed in an able and interesting manner\r\nby Professor Cooper, of Philadelphia, in a public discourse, which\r\nhas now been some months before the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n9. _Brucite._\r\n\r\nA new Species in Mineralogy, discovered by the late Dr. Bruce. We\r\nhope to publish in the next Number a description and analysis of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n10. _Lithography._\r\n\r\nWe are promised for our next Number, a full account of this art,\r\nof which we have received a beautiful specimen, _A Minerva_,\r\nexecuted by Mr. Bates Otis, an ingenious and enterprising artist\r\nof Philadelphia, who, under the patronage of Dr. Samuel Brown, is\r\npreparing to disseminate the productions of his skill, and to make\r\nthis important art (executed with American materials,) extensively\r\nuseful in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nN. B. As this number has already much exceeded its proper size, we\r\nare obliged to suppress many articles of domestic, and all those of\r\nforeign intelligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the prospectus of this work, the expectation was expressed that\r\neach Number would contain from 64 to 80 pages; that as many as\r\nfour Numbers might be issued within the year, and engravings were\r\npromised for such subjects as might require them.\r\n\r\nThe Numbers published, have actually contained from 104 to 132\r\npages, the four have been issued within a period of ten months, and\r\ntwelve copper-plate engravings and several woodcuts, illustrate the\r\npresent volume.\r\n\r\nOf the subjects proposed in the plan of the work, our pages contain\r\nnotices, more or less extensive, of Geology, Mineralogy, Botany,\r\nZoology, Chemistry, Natural Philosophy, Mathematics, Useful Arts,\r\nFine Arts, Inventions, Reviews, Biography, and Intelligence. How\r\nfar then we have redeemed our pledge, we leave it for our readers\r\nto decide.\r\n\r\nIn the commencement of an enterprise, for the first time attempted\r\nin this country, an enterprise arduous in its nature and uncertain\r\nin its issue, it will not be doubted that considerable solicitude\r\nwas experienced.\r\n\r\nTo concentrate American efforts in science and the arts, by\r\nfurnishing a Journal to record their proceedings, will, in our\r\nview, not only have a direct influence in promoting the honour\r\nand prosperity of the nation as connected with its physical\r\ninterests, but will also tend in no small degree to nourish an\r\nenlarged patriotism, by winning the public mind from the odious\r\nasperities of party. That entire success will attend our efforts,\r\nit would perhaps be presumptuous to expect, but we trust that\r\nthe interesting previous question, whether such a work can be\r\nadequately sustained, by appropriate materials, may be considered\r\nas now decided. The support which we have received, and for which\r\nwe are deeply grateful, has been far beyond our most sanguine\r\nhopes, and has caused us to dispense with no small portion of those\r\nless important efforts of our own, with which we were prepared to\r\nsuccour our infant undertaking.\r\n\r\nIf we may be allowed to express a wish relative to the nature of\r\nfuture communications, it would be, that those of a scientific\r\nnature should not be diminished, while those relating to the arts,\r\nto agriculture, and to domestic economy, should be increased; we\r\nparticularly solicit the communications of practical men, versed in\r\nthe useful and ornamental arts, and they will be acceptable should\r\nthey not even be clothed in a scientific dress.\r\n\r\nArrangements have been made for the reception of an increased\r\nnumber of the best European Journals, both from the continent and\r\nfrom Britain; they have already begun to arrive, and we hope to\r\ngive in future numbers, more full details of foreign scientific\r\nintelligence, although it is true that this species of information\r\nhas hitherto been stinted, not from poverty of materials, but from\r\nthe pressure of original American communications.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn justice to the publishers of this work, we add, that _this\r\npublication is an expensive one_; very heavy advances have been\r\nalready made by them, while only a trivial amount has been received\r\nin return. It is hoped, therefore, that subscribers will promptly\r\nremit, _free from postage_, the small stipulated sum, and also make\r\nthe required advance for the succeeding volume. This last is not\r\ndue till the first number of that volume has been issued, but it\r\nwould save postage to remit both sums at once, and thus also it\r\nwill be known what subscriptions are continued. In a subscription\r\nso widely dispersed over a large portion of the United States, an\r\ninattention to _punctual payment_, must soon put in hazard the\r\nexistence of a work, having otherwise the fairest prospects of\r\ncontinuance, and we hope of usefulness.\r\n\r\nShould this appeal be promptly answered, the first number of\r\nthe next volume (already in considerable forwardness,) will be\r\npublished in the course of the summer; and should men of ability\r\ncontinue to furnish communications, and _the public be willing to\r\npay for the work_, it is our wish to publish future numbers with\r\ngreater frequency, and to complete our volumes whenever we are\r\nprepared, without confining ourselves to particular periods of time.\r\n\r\n_New-Haven, Conn.

To him we are indebted for a complete science\r\nof crystallography, and for having determined the existence and\r\nlimit of species, which mineralogists had not obtained, and\r\nchemists could not determine.

His knowledge of this plant was derived from my Herbarium,\r\nwhere he found it under the name of _tripsacum cylindricum, Mich_?\r\nAlthough it can hardly be the plant of _Michaux_, it was so\r\nconsidered by the late _Dr. Muhlenberg_, when specimens were first\r\ncommunicated to him. It remains under this name in his Herbarium,\r\nbut is not included in his _work on the grasses_. He left it for me\r\nto describe along with other new and doubtful plants from the south.\r\n\r\n[52] This is the specific name found in my Herbarium by _Mr.\r\nNuttall_, under which it had been previously transmitted to Mr.\r\nElliott. _Vid._ _Nuttall's North American Genera_, v.

Lond. ed.\r\n\r\n[58] Maintained by Dr. Mitchill.\r\n\r\n[59] My friend, Dr. John Torrey, has favoured me with the following\r\nresults of some experiments, which he made at my request upon\r\nthe last snow which fell. \"A pint and a half of snow water was\r\nreduced by evaporation to a few drops. On testing this with\r\nvegetable blue infusions no alteration of colour took place. It was\r\nafterward evaporated to dryness, and about a quarter of a grain\r\nof a solid residuum was obtained. This was redissolved in a small\r\nquantity of pure rain water, and prussiate of potash added to it,\r\nwithout occasioning any precipitate. Nitrate of silver produced\r\na white precipitate so copious, that the solution was thick with\r\nit. Carbonate of soda produced no effect. The transparency of a\r\nsolution of muriate of barytes was not disturbed by it. These\r\nexperiments prove, that a _free acid_ does not exist in snow water,\r\nbut that the muriate exists in it combined with an alkali, which is\r\nmost probably soda.\"\r\n\r\n[60] Mr. J. Murray, of London, considers this to be a mistake.\r\n_Free muriatic acid_, and not muriate of soda, he says, will be\r\nfound in the recipient.--_Elements of Chemistry._ Part I. p. 212.\r\nLond. ed. 1818.\r\n\r\n[61] That is, in those oaks which grow near the salt water, the\r\nbranches that directly face the sea do not attain so great size and\r\nstrength as those on the opposite side; this has also been observed\r\non the south side of Long-Island.\r\n\r\n[62] Volney's Travels in Syria and Egypt.

The fruit of those cocoa-nut\r\ntrees which grow near the seashore in the West-Indies is generally\r\nfound to have a saltish taste; and even the milk in the nut is\r\nperceptibly impregnated with it. Those trees on the contrary which\r\ngrow in the interior, beyond the influence of salt water, have\r\ntheir fruit perfectly fresh and sweet.\r\n\r\nThe same gentleman informs me, that in a plantation of his\r\nfather's, in the West-Indies, situated on the seashore, a whole\r\ncrop of the cane was rendered unfit for the purpose of making\r\nsugar, in consequence of the great quantity of salt which it had\r\nimbibed.\r\n\r\n[66] Journal of Science and the Arts.

This predisposition appears to exist in a\r\ngreat degree among the Egyptians, and depends upon the nature of\r\ntheir climate, their habits, and mode of living, all of which have\r\na tendency to produce _debility_ of the eyes, and thus render them\r\nmore susceptible of the impression of those causes which excite\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\n[69] Rush's Medical Observations and Inquiries, Vol. II. p. 132.\r\n\r\n[70] Volney's Travels, Vol I. p. 226.\r\n\r\n[71] Rush's Observations and Inquiries, Vol. II. p. 133.\r\n\r\n[72] This was most remarkably perceived on one occasion, where,\r\nunder the idea that possibly chrome might exist in the ores, they\r\nhad been intensely heated in a forge along with pearl ashes. The\r\nmass, when lixiviated, gave only a greenish solution, becoming\r\ncolourless by nitric acid, and again greenish by an alkali; this\r\nwas supposed to be owing to iron and manganese. No metal was\r\nobtained, except a few minute globules of attractable iron, but the\r\nlaboratory was filled with white fumes, having the peculiar odour\r\nalluded to.\r\n\r\n[73] Several of the facts, we are aware, accord with the properties\r\nof bismuth, between which and tellurium there are several strong\r\npoints of resemblance, but a number of other facts appear\r\nirreconcilable with the properties of that metal, and of every\r\nother except tellurium.\r\n\r\n[74] Excepting, that the covers ought to be so depressed, as that\r\ntheir brims may be lower than the bottoms of the interior vessels\r\nover which they are placed respectively. This is necessary to\r\nprevent the gas from escaping, ere it have access to the surface of\r\nthe fluid beneath those bottoms.\r\n\r\n[75] The apparatus may also be made of glass bottles, duly\r\nproportioned, and cut (truncated) alternately near the shoulder and\r\nnear the bottom.\r\n\r\n[76] In whose Journal it was ordered to be printed, but, to prevent\r\ndelay, it was published, by the Author, in a separate paper, and\r\nforwarded by him to the Editor of this Journal.\r\n\r\n[77] Possibly the electric fluid causes decompositions when emitted\r\nfrom an impalpable point (as in the experiments of Wollaston)\r\nbecause its repulsive agency is concentred between integral atoms,\r\nin a mode analogous to that here referred to; a filament of water\r\nin the one case, and of wire in the other, being the medium of\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\n[78] The conclusions are drawn from experiments made by the\r\nelectricity of the Voltaic apparatus.\r\n\r\n[79] Especially to Dr. T. P. Jones, and Mr. Rubens Peale, who\r\nremember the suggestion.\r\n\r\n[80] See Plate.
