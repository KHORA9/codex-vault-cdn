BAILEY & SONS COMPANY\r\n    SAN JOSE, CALIFORNIA\r\n    1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor several years beginners in the Angora goat industry were without\r\ntext books, and even to-day there are very few practical treatises. From\r\nour forty years of experience in farming Angoras, and from the personal\r\nobservations of our Dr. W. C. Bailey, while in the interior of Asia\r\nMinor, we have tried to select the essential points in the successful\r\nmanagement of Angora flocks, and to present these points so that they\r\nmay be used.\r\n\r\nWe have given a brief outline of the history of the Angora goat, but we\r\nhave devoted several pages to consideration of detail in breeding and\r\nkidding. It has been our aim to make this a practical text book for the\r\nbeginner in the Angora industry, and if it proves of value to him, it\r\nhas fulfilled its mission.\r\n\r\n    The Authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nORIGIN AND HISTORY OF THE ANGORA GOAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the origin and early history of the Angora goat little is known.\r\nIt is supposed that the Angora variety descended from one of the classes\r\nof wild goats, and different writers have contended that different\r\ngenera were the foundation of the Angora species. They have based these\r\nclaims upon the characteristics of the horns, the covering of the body,\r\nshape and size of the animal, and various other details. Several agree\r\nthat Capra AEgagrus is the class of goat from which the Angora species\r\nhas developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nKNOWN FACTS.\r\n\r\nPresent history traces the Angora goat to the vilayet of Angora, in Asia\r\nMinor, and to the country immediately surrounding this vilayet. Some\r\nhave set a date over two thousand years ago, claiming that the Angora\r\ngoat was introduced into Asia Minor at that time, but the only authentic\r\nhistory is that given by Tournefort, a French naturalist, employed by\r\nhis government, who explored Asia Minor about two hundred and fifty\r\nyears ago, and who described and pictured the Angora goat about as he\r\nappears to-day and by Evliya Effendi, a Turk, who wrote in 1550 of the\r\ngoats, and by a few other writers. That they have not changed more is\r\ndue to the fact that the Turk is quite content as he is, and he has no\r\nambition to breed a different goat from what he has had for at least the\r\npast three centuries.\r\n\r\n\r\nASIA MINOR.\r\n\r\nBefore we consider the migrations of the Angora goat, we will\r\ninvestigate the physical conditions of their native province. The\r\ninterior of Asia Minor, or the Angora goat country, is from one to four\r\nthousand feet above the sea level. Low, rolling hills and broad plains,\r\ntreeless and almost waterless; dry, hot and desolate in the summer, and\r\ncovered with more or less snow in the winter, form the habitat of the\r\nAngora. A small fine fibered sage brush is the principal diet of the\r\ngoat, both summer and winter, but in the spring this diet is\r\nsupplemented with weeds and some grass, and in the summer some of the\r\ngoats are driven to the higher mountains, where there are some scrub\r\npines and other varieties of brush. There is no winter feeding. The\r\ngoats make their own living on the tops of the sage brush, which\r\nprotrude through the snow.\r\n\r\nThe indolent Turks do make some provision for the shelter of themselves\r\nand the goats in the winter. If a cave can be found it is divided so\r\nthat the goats share the quarters with the humans. Sometimes an adobe\r\nhouse is so arranged that the goats and other livestock occupy the lower\r\npart of the house and the natives the upper part, or if there be but one\r\nfloor, a low fence is run across to keep the livestock out of the living\r\nquarters. Great greyish-white wolfish looking dogs, wearing formidable\r\ncollars of sharpened spikes go with the shepherds during the day and\r\nwatch the flocks during the night. They are used as a means of\r\nprotection from thieves, and not as an aid in herding. The flocks camp\r\naround the cave or hut, and are not confined in corrals. Fences are\r\nalmost unknown in the Angora country. There are probably four or five\r\nmillion Angora goats in Asia Minor. Much of the central plateau region\r\nof the United States is very similar to the Angora region of Turkey. A\r\npeculiar fact is that the mohair produced in the different sections of\r\nAsia Minor varies a little, and the mohair merchants of Constantinople\r\nreadily recognize an appreciable difference in its market value. Even\r\nthe smaller merchants in the country recognize a difference in the\r\nmohair grown within a few miles of their town. Some try to explain this\r\nby a difference in food, others by slight climatic changes, and still\r\nothers by the soil formation. Some of the goats from the locality of\r\nGeredeh, in the province of Kastamouni, have fleeces which are filled\r\nwith grease. They are as black and gummy as merino sheep. This mohair,\r\nhowever, scours white. The most marketable mohair comes from Beibazar\r\nand Eskischehr. That this difference in the quality of the mohair is not\r\nentirely due to climate or food conditions is evidenced by the fact that\r\nAngoras taken from Beibazar to California still retain the same\r\nqualities in the mohair after four years in California. However, it has\r\nbeen noticed that different parts of the United States produce different\r\nqualities of mohair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE IN ASIA-MINOR.\r\n\r\nTurkish owner, his herder, holding an Angora buck kid and the\r\ngrey-wolfish-looking dogs wearing collars of sharpened spikes.

Davis, of Columbia, South Carolina, was presented with\r\nnine choice animals by the Sultan. The Sultan had requested President\r\nPolk to send a man to Turkey who understood the culture of cotton. Dr.\r\nDavis was appointed, and upon his return to America the Sultan, as a\r\ncourtesy, presented him with the goats. For many years after their\r\narrival in the United States these goats were considered cashmeres.\r\nEarly reports about the fleeces and the goats were erroneous, and many\r\nwere led to believe that the fleeces from these goats were worth $8 per\r\npound, and that the goats would shear from six to eight pounds per year.\r\n\r\nDr. Davis did not do very well with the goats. He crossed his Angora\r\nbuck onto some of the native common goats, and sold some of the\r\ncross-bloods and possibly some of the original importation to various\r\nparties, but in 1854, Col. Richard Peters, of Atlanta, Georgia, secured\r\nmost of the Davis goats. To Col. Peters really belongs the credit of\r\nkeeping the Angora breed in existence in the United States up to the\r\nearly sixties. Col. Peters was very fond of his Angoras, and he\r\ncontinued to own and run them up to the time of his death. He made a\r\nvery creditable exhibit at the New Orleans World's Fair in 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHENERY IMPORTATIONS.\r\n\r\nW. W. Chenery of Belmont, near Boston, Massachusetts, is supposed to\r\nhave made the next two importations in 1861. No one seems to know\r\nexactly how many goats Mr. Chenery imported or what became of these\r\nlots. Mr. Thompson quotes the Massachusetts Ploughman as saying, \"The\r\nfirst of the two lots, consisting of thirty nine animals, was shipped\r\nfrom Constantinople on the 26th of March, 1861, and arrived at Boston on\r\nthe 15th of May, except two animals which died on the passage. The\r\nsecond lot consisting of forty one head, left Constantinople on the 6th\r\nof October, 1861, and arrived at Boston on the 25th of November with the\r\nloss of only one on the voyage. In the whole flock, eighty in all, there\r\nwere about a dozen males, and all the animals wintered well.\"\r\n\r\nIt is generally supposed that Mr. Chenery made another importation in\r\n1866, of about twenty head.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANGORA GOAT.\r\n\r\nBrown and Diehl Importation, about 1868 or 1869.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROWN AND DIEHL IMPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThe next importation of practical importance, although it was claimed\r\nthat nine head were received about 1861, by one Stiles, was made by\r\nIsrael S. Diehl, a former U.S. consul and C. S. Brown, of Newark, New\r\nJersey, about 1868. Mr. Diehl was commissioned by the United States\r\ngovernment to investigate the industry in Turkey, and he secured a lot\r\nof Angoras, variously estimated at from one hundred to one hundred and\r\nsixty head. Mr. C. P. Bailey furnished the money for the transportation\r\nof these goats to California. He says, \"Some were fairly good and some\r\nwere only ordinary. They were of medium size, and with the exception of\r\nthe neck, tolerably well covered with fleece, which however had a\r\nscattering of kemp throughout. They were conceded to be the best brought\r\nto California up to that time.\" Some of these bucks had been tampered\r\nwith and were sterile.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUTICHIDES IMPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThis shipment followed the Brown and Diehl importation, and consisted of\r\nbetween one hundred and fifty and two hundred animals. A. Eutichides,\r\nwas a native of Turkey, and claimed that he had some fine goats, but he\r\nhad an immense amount of trouble with his Angoras, and lost a good many.\r\nThey were held in Virginia for some time, and then were sent to\r\nSacramento, California, and were afterwards sold by the express\r\ncompany, at public auction, at very low prices. This was about 1873. It\r\nwas generally believed by old California breeders that some of the goats\r\noffered at this sale were cross-bloods of California origin. The blood\r\nof this importation, however, has been widely scattered over the Pacific\r\nCoast.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HALL AND HARRIS IMPORTATION.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, John S. Harris, of Hollister, California, returned from a\r\nperilous journey around the world in quest of new Angoras. He found the\r\nThibet goats in the Himalaya Mountains, and finally succeeded in getting\r\nsome goats at Angora, in Asia Minor. He secured two bucks and ten does,\r\nand brought them safely to California. That was really the first time an\r\nAmerican had entered Asia Minor to study the Angora industry, as it was\r\nunderstood Mr. Diehl had secured Turks to go into the interior for him.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JENKS IMPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThis was a small importation of Angoras, supposed to have been three\r\nanimals, made by C. W. Jenks of Boston, and sold to Col. Peters of\r\nGeorgia. They were supposed to have come from Geredeh, in the interior\r\nof Asia Minor, and they arrived in the United States in 1880. The mohair\r\nfrom these goats was not considered very good, and the importation was\r\nnot regarded as very important.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHULTS IMPORTATION.\r\n\r\nThis was the first importation made from South Africa to the United\r\nStates and arrived in 1886. There were two bucks and two does, and they\r\nwent to Fink & Company, of Texas. There was a great deal of question\r\nabout this importation, and so far as is known it was of no value to\r\nAmerican flocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE C. P. BAILEY & SONS CO. IMPORTATIONS.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, the first importation of Angora goats from South Africa, which\r\nwas of value to American flocks, arrived. The two bucks, Pasha and Dick,\r\nwhich were secured by C. P. Bailey from R. Cawood, were sired by the\r\ngreat buck Sam. Mr. Schreiner says, \"Sam was born in 1888, and sheared\r\nas a three year old, at twelve month growth, 15 pounds 2 ounces. He was\r\nexhibited for many years at all chief Agricultural shows and was never\r\nbeaten but once, a judgment reversed at a subsequent show in the same\r\nyear. Sam was the most famous goat in South Africa; with splendid weight\r\nof fleece, he combined a fineness of fiber rarely seen in an old ram.\"\r\n\r\nPasha developed into a great sire and his get has been distributed into\r\nnearly every State in the Union, Canada, Mexico and Australia. Without\r\ndoubt Pasha's blood courses through the veins of more Angoras than any\r\nsire ever imported. He was acknowledged by every one to be the best\r\nindividual ever brought to America. Mr. Landrum, who had seen most of\r\nthe Angoras brought from Turkey and who saw Pasha at San Jose,\r\nCalifornia, in 1899, pronounced him the most perfect goat he had ever\r\nseen and a much better goat than any which had ever come to America from\r\nTurkey. He bought some of Pasha's get for his own flock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANGORA BUCK PASHA.\r\n\r\nBailey South Africa Importation 1893.]\r\n\r\nIn 1899, the buck Capetown was imported by Mr. Bailey from South Africa\r\nto secure certain points. Size and a little \"yolk,\" together with the\r\ncovering, fineness, freeness from kemp, ringlets and evenness were\r\nespecially desired. Capetown has been a great sire and is still in fine\r\ncondition on the Bailey farms.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASIA MINOR GOATS.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, Dr. W. C. Bailey, armed with an honorary commission from the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, personally visited every\r\ngoat-raising section of Asia Minor, and after seeing hundreds of\r\nthousands, and examining minutely hundreds, secured and succeeded in\r\nexporting two bucks and two does. The Sultan had passed an edict in\r\n1881, prohibiting the export of these animals, as he hoped to keep the\r\nindustry for Asia Minor. The undertaking was a hazardous one, and the\r\nexpedition was fought with many and almost insurmountable difficulties.\r\nAsia Minor is alive with bandits, and to hold a foreigner for ransom is\r\na favorite pastime. Then, too, a Christian's life is not considered of\r\nmuch value by a Mohamedan. The goats were transported for miles on mule\r\nand camel back, carried across the Bosphorus under a boat load of hay,\r\ndisfigured by shearing and powdered with coal dust, transported through\r\nthe streets of Constantinople in closed carriages protected from police\r\nmolestation by the \"golden wand,\" and finally condemned by the Italian\r\nGovernment because no health certificate accompanied them from point of\r\nshipment, but eventually landed in California in 1901. The bucks\r\nBeibazar and Kjutiah, and the does Moholitch and Eskischehr find the\r\nclimate of California suited to their wants. These four goats cost over\r\n$5,000 landed in California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUCK BEIBAZAR AND DOE MOHOLITCH.\r\n\r\nBailey Asia Minor Importation 1901. Photo taken by Dr. Bailey on the\r\nplains of Asia Minor, March 7, 1901, while the goats were held by a\r\nTurkish guide.]\r\n\r\nBeibazar impresses his qualities markedly on his offspring. His get won\r\nthe Sweepstake prizes at the California and Oregon State Fairs in 1904,\r\nand the championship for two-year-old buck at the World's Fair at St.\r\nLouis, U. S. A., in 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LANDRUM IMPORTATION.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, Wm. M. Landrum imported two bucks from South Africa. Their get\r\nhas been quite widely distributed in America, and has been of\r\nconsiderable value.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOERLE IMPORTATION.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, G. A. Hoerle imported about one hundred and thirty head from\r\nSouth Africa. A few of these goats were exhibited at the St. Louis\r\nWorld's Fair, and some of them have been distributed to American\r\nbreeders. A large part of them are now in New Jersey, and just what\r\ntheir effect will be on American flocks remains to be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BEIBAZAR.\r\n\r\nBailey Asia Minor Importation, 1901.]\r\n\r\n\r\nANGORA GOATS IN SOUTH AFRICA.\r\n\r\nIn 1838, Col. Henderson made the first importation of Angora goats into\r\nSouth Africa, but while the number reaching the Cape was fourteen, yet\r\nonly two proved to be perfect animals, a doe and her kid. The twelve\r\nbucks seem to have been tampered with, and they would not breed. Mr.\r\nSchreiner says: \"But for the fact that there were several million Boar\r\ngoats, thoroughly accustomed to the country, to furnish innumerable ewes\r\nfor grading up purposes, the industry would still have been in its\r\ninfancy.\" It was years before any more Angoras were imported into South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThe second importation into Cape Colony was made by Messrs. Mosenthal in\r\n1856, and thirty Angoras reached their destination. Mr. Schreiner\r\nreports that some of these goats were sold at public auction and brought\r\nabout $350 to $400 each.\r\n\r\nThe third importation was made by Sir Titus Salt, the English\r\nmanufacturer of mohair, and arrived in South Africa in 1857. Dr. White\r\nhad charge of these after they reached the colony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPETOWN.\r\n\r\nBailey South African Importation, 1899.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth importation consisted of about thirty-five animals, and was\r\nmade about 1858 by Mr. W. R. Thompson. These were considered very fine\r\nanimals, and were quite different from any previously imported.\r\n\r\nTen years later in 1868, another importation was made by South Africa\r\nand from then on to 1880 between twelve and fifteen more lots were\r\nsecured, some of them consisting of hundreds of animals. In the twelve\r\nyears, up to 1880, over three thousand goats were received in South\r\nAfrica from Asia Minor. Some of them brought as high as $2,200 each.\r\n\r\nDuring the next fourteen years there was a lack of importations into the\r\nColony. In 1894, the first lot of American Angora goats, six head, were\r\nsecured from C. P. Bailey of San Jose, California. They were sold to the\r\nCape farmers by the importers at satisfactory prices, and in June, 1895,\r\nanother lot of twenty bucks were secured from Mr. Bailey for $1000 cash.\r\nThese bucks had a hard trip, and shed their fleece, but they were sold\r\nby the importer later.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, another importation of one hundred and sixty-five head were\r\nsecured by consent of the Sultan from Asia Minor. In 1896 another\r\nimportation of sixty-three head were landed and sold to the Cape\r\nfarmers. The highest priced buck of this lot brought about $1,850, and\r\nthe highest priced doe about $1,000. These goats were not considered\r\nextra, with the exception of a few of the tops. They were not uniform,\r\nthe breeches were bad, bellies deficiently covered, and they carried\r\nconsiderable kemp.\r\n\r\n\r\nANGORAS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\nEven before the arrival of Angora goats in South Africa they had been\r\ntried in Holland, France and England. Australia also imported some in\r\n1856, but the industry has not grown to any extent in any of these\r\ncountries. There have been some Angoras exported to Australia from\r\nAmerica since 1900. Canada, Mexico, Alaska, and some of the Pacific\r\nIslands, have small flocks of Angora goats at the present time. The\r\nstart has been obtained largely from California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOHAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat part of the fleece of the Angora goat, which at a year's growth is\r\ncomposed of long, lustrous, elastic fibers, is called Mohair. It may be\r\nmore or less curled, but it is readily distinguishable from that part of\r\nthe fleece of the Angora which is composed of short, stiff fibers, known\r\nas kemp.\r\n\r\nThe word mohair probably has its origin in modern times, as the Turkish\r\nword for mohair is tiftick. A theory which is advanced by Mr. George\r\nGatheral of Constantinople, and which is tenable, is that the early\r\nDutch traders who visited Angora, found the native clergy wearing a gown\r\nmade of mohair. The Turks called the cloth \"mahr,\" and it is possible\r\nthat the traders applied this word to the raw material. If this be so,\r\nthe English have corrupted the word into the present term mohair.\r\n\r\nThe color of mohair varies in different localities and on different\r\nindividuals. In the vilayet of Koniah, in Asia Minor, is a breed of\r\ngoats producing a brownish colored mohair. This material is sold upon\r\nthe market as Koniah mohair. The Koniah goat, however, has been rapidly\r\ndisappearing, as the herdsmen found that the foreign demand was for\r\nwhite mohair, and they have been crossing the white Angora bucks on the\r\nbrown Koniah does. There are still over one hundred thousand pounds of\r\nKoniah mohair produced each year. In the Angora flocks of Asia Minor one\r\nalways finds some colored goats. Black, blue, brown or red, usually with\r\nan admixture of white, are the common colors. The same thing may be said\r\nof the American flocks of Angoras. One may have been breeding white\r\nAngoras for years when, without apparent cause, a colored kid is\r\ndropped. Then color of the soil may give the mohair a peculiar tinge,\r\nbut this usually scours out. The kemp in Asia Minor is sometimes a\r\ndifferent color from the mohair. The kemp may be red or black and the\r\nmohair white. White mohair is what the manufacturer wants. If he wishes\r\nto make colored goods, he can dye white whatever color he wishes, but a\r\ncolored mohair can only be used for certain colored goods.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRADES AND GRADING OF MOHAIR.\r\n\r\nIn Turkey, after the fleece is shorn, the owner packs each fleece\r\nseparately in sacks. He picks out the tag locks, colored fleeces or\r\nobjectionable mohair, and after washing it, or making it more fit for\r\nmarket, he packs this in a sack by itself. Every village has its buyers,\r\nusually Greeks or Armenians, and there are a few traveling buyers. These\r\nmen gradually collect the mohair. Men who have more money than they\r\nneed put that money into mohair, as mohair is always salable, and it is\r\nso bulky that there is not much danger of it being stolen. There are so\r\nmany robbers in Turkey that nothing is absolutely safe. One coffee house\r\nkeeper in a small village sent about six dollars down to a larger place,\r\nas he was afraid to keep so much money in his house. When the mohair is\r\ncollected in the larger towns it is again sorted, care being taken not\r\nto mix lots from different sections of the country. It is then forwarded\r\nto Constantinople of Ismidt, which is on the Sea of Marmara, near\r\nConstantinople. Here expert sorters go over the lots again. They do not\r\nbreak up the fleece, but they collect fleeces which are about the same\r\nand from the same district--for instance, Beibazar, Kjutiah, Kastamonia,\r\nEskischehr, etc. These fleeces are then packed in bags and marked\r\nx - xx- xxx, or lettered a, b, AA, or numbered 1, 2, 3, etc. The\r\nmohair is then ready for exportation. It can be readily seen that a\r\nmanufacturer who wants a particular kind of mohair can get exactly what\r\nhe wants, if he knows the kind of mohair which comes from the different\r\ndistricts, and the grade of mohair which is put up under a certain mark\r\nby a certain firm. He can order of Mr. B. one hundred bags XX Beibazar\r\nmohair, and he knows what he is going to find when he opens the bags.\r\nThere is a large room in Constantinople where a gang of men are almost\r\nconstantly at work sorting mohair. The commission men have their store\r\nrooms around this central room; when the sorters finish with Mr. A's lot\r\nthey commence to sort for Mr. B. Thus the same men sort all the mohair,\r\nand this insures a uniformity of grade.\r\n\r\nIn America the plan of handling is somewhat different. It will be easier\r\nto tell what should be done than what is done. Until each grower becomes\r\nsomething of an expert sorter, or until we have central depots, where\r\nthe mohair can be properly graded, the grower should roll the fleeces\r\nseparately; they should not be tied, and put them in a bag or bale. He\r\nshould pick out the tag locks, mohair discolored or clotted with urine\r\nor faeces, the colored fleeces, burry mohair or very kempy fleeces, and\r\nafter preparation, put them in a separate parcel. Any kind of a bur or\r\nseed which sticks in the mohair must be picked out by hand. If the\r\nmanufacturer has to do this, he puts a price on the mohair which will\r\nleave him plenty of margin. That is, he pays the grower about one-half\r\nas much as the mohair would be worth if it were free from this foreign\r\nmaterial. If the mohair is very burry, it has to be treated chemically,\r\nand this spoils the luster. Sometimes the grower can make good wages by\r\nhaving the burs picked out before the animals are shorn. One man can\r\npick the burs out of from fifteen to twenty-five animals a day, if there\r\nare not too many burs in the mohair. If the tag locks can be cleaned\r\nsufficiently by washing, they are of some value; but if not, they are\r\nhardly worth the expense of shipping.\r\n\r\nThe mohair shorn from kids should be kept in parcels by itself, as it is\r\nusually finer and worth top prices. That of the does, if it differs from\r\nthat of the wethers, should be packed separately. When the mohair is\r\nreceived by the mill it is sent to the sorting room.\r\n\r\n\r\nSORTING BY THE MANUFACTURER.\r\n\r\nEach goat's fleece is made up of a variety of different grades of\r\nmohair. Before a fleece can be spun it must be separated into these\r\ndifferent grades as nearly as possible, and this is done by expert\r\nsorters, who select from the raw material about seven different degrees\r\nof fineness of fiber. They also take into consideration freeness from\r\nkemp and color. In separating the fleece much dust is liberated, and as\r\nsome mohair is liable to carry the bacillus of anthrax, or other\r\ndangerous material, this dust, if allowed to circulate in the air, would\r\nbecome a serious menace to the health of the sorters. Wool sorters'\r\ndisease is by no means uncommon, and one of the American mill owners\r\nreported that his sorters had such a dread of a foreign mohair which\r\ncame packed in a distinctive package, that he had to stop handling this\r\nparticular lot, although it was profitable stuff to spin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOHAIR TRANSPORTATION IN CONSTANTINOPLE, TURKEY.\r\n\r\nPhoto taken by Dr. Bailey.]\r\n\r\nTo obviate this danger as far as possible each man opens the fleeces on\r\na table covered with wire screen, under which circulates a strong\r\nexhaust current of air which is mechanically generated. Thus small\r\nforeign particles and dust in the fleeces are drawn downward. When the\r\nfleece is opened the sorter selects that part of the fleece which is\r\nknown to be the coarsest, _i. e._, the breech and a strip along the\r\ncenter of the back, and puts this in one lot. Next he selects a narrow\r\nstrip along the side of the fleece, which is known to be the finest part\r\nof the fleece, and puts this in another lot. Now the neck and the belly\r\nare separated and thrown into their classes. If the whole fleece were a\r\nfine one, and free from kemp, it would be sorted in the same way, but\r\ndifferent parts of the fleece would go into proportionately higher\r\nclasses. The lots which these sorters make are known to spin\r\ncomparatively definite qualities of yarn. Thus the low breech and the\r\nback of most fleeces will not spin over No. 20 to No. 24 yarns, and the\r\nsides of good fleeces are fine in fiber and will spin No. 40 to No. 60\r\nyarn.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of mohair which one man can sort varies considerably,\r\naccording to the class of mohair which he is given to work upon. One\r\nmill estimated that experts can sort between two and three hundred\r\npounds of domestic mohair a day, and that it costs about a cent a pound\r\nto thus separate the fleece. After the fleeces are graded, the mohair\r\nis ready to be sent to the mill proper for scouring and spinning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOURING.\r\n\r\nTo-day the process of washing or scouring the fleece is done by\r\nmachinery. The mohair is fed into a machine in which revolve paddles,\r\nwhich thoroughly mix the fiber with the liquid in this machine. At the\r\nopposite end from where it was fed in, the mohair is rolled out over\r\nwarm rollers, and it is ready to be spun. It is claimed, and with some\r\njustice, that American mohair loses or shrinks about 12% to 20% while\r\npassing through this washing machine, and that Turkish mohair only\r\nshrinks about 13%. This may be due to the fact that some of the Turkish\r\nhair had been washed before it was shipped to market, and that by\r\nprevious sorting some of the dirt had fallen out of the mohair. Then,\r\ntoo, some of the American growers are not very careful to keep the\r\nfleeces clean. Straw, sticks, hats, and even stones have been found in\r\nsome domestic stuff.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXING.\r\n\r\nAfter the mohair is thoroughly cleaned it is ready for spinning or\r\ncarding. In order to spin the fibers most economically, evenly and to\r\nthe best advantage, some of the mills mix different qualities of mohair\r\nof about the same fineness. For instance, Turkish mohair is mixed with\r\nTexas and California stuff, or Oregon is mixed with Iowa material. The\r\nspinning qualities of mohair from different sections varies, and this\r\nmixing tends to give uniformity. After the fibers have been mixed to\r\nsuit, the mohair is run through straightening machines in preparation\r\nfor the combing process.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST OR NOBLE COMB.\r\n\r\nThis comb is so arranged that about two and a half inches of the base of\r\nall of the mohair fibers, and any other fibers which may be mixed with\r\nthem, are held, the ends of the fibers which are longer than two and a\r\nhalf inches, hang freely and are caught in a revolving machine and\r\ndragged loose from the combs which hold the base of the fiber. Thus only\r\nthose fibers two and a half inches long, or less, are left in the first\r\ncomb. The longer fibers, or tops as they are now called, to distinguish\r\nthem from the noil, or short fibers, are collected and are again passed\r\nthrough a second comb.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND OR LISTER COMB.\r\n\r\nMuch the same process as was gone through with in the Noble comb, is\r\nrepeated, except that now only the Noble top is combed, and as all of\r\nthe fibers, less than two and a half inches, have been removed from this\r\nmohair, the comb is set so that any fibers shorter than four or five\r\ninches, shall be held as noil, and only those fibers which are longer\r\nthan four or five inches shall be included in the top. This combing\r\ncompleted, we have a collection of mohair fibers none of them less than\r\nabout five inches in length. This top is now ready to spin. This combing\r\nis rendered necessary by the fact that all of the mohair contains an\r\nadmixture of kemp, and kemp cannot be spun with the finer grades of\r\nmohair. In getting this kemp out of the mohair many of the short mohair\r\nfibers are lost, so that combing is an expensive process. It costs in\r\ntime, labor and mohair.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPINNING.\r\n\r\nMany strands of this Lister top are now drawn down into a single thread.\r\nThis thread, if the fibers comprising it are coarse, may have some\r\nprojecting ends, which give it a rough, uneven appearance, and if so,\r\nthese ends are burned off. The thread is passed through a gas flame at a\r\ngiven rate of speed by machinery, and the projecting ends are singed.\r\nThis is called genapping. The yarn is now ready for manufacturing. In\r\nBradford, England, there are mills which only spin the yarn. Their trade\r\nis with the manufacturers, both at home and abroad, and it is a known\r\nfact that, while France and Germany manufacture much plush and braid,\r\nthey buy all of their yarn from Bradford.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARDING.\r\n\r\nShort mohair, that is, mohair less than six inches long, is not run\r\nthrough combs, as above described. It is run over a carding wheel, or a\r\nlarge metal cylinder covered with small brads, which mix all the mohair\r\nand kemp. After passing over a number of these wheels, which revolve in\r\ndifferent directions, the material thus carded is ready to spin.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOIL.\r\n\r\nSome of the noil collected by the combing process is composed of a large\r\npercentage of short mohair. This noil has a considerable value and is\r\nsometimes carded. The lower grade noil is sold to carpet manufacturers\r\nand various users of low grade stuff. Noil usually brings from twelve to\r\ntwenty cents a pound.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSES OF MOHAIR.\r\n\r\nAs yet mohair has been used for only a limited number of things. Its\r\npossibilities have not been developed. New uses for the fiber are being\r\ndiscovered, and it seems probable that there will be many things made of\r\nmohair in the future. The yarn has a beautiful luster and is very\r\ndurable. When ladies' lustre goods are in fashion a large amount of\r\nmohair goes into these fabrics. Much mohair is used in dress goods and\r\nmen's goods. There is a steady demand for mohair plushes and braids.\r\n\r\nThere is no plush made which will give the service, present the luster\r\nand retain a standing pile as long as mohair. One may crush the nap of\r\na mohair plush as often or as long as he pleases, but the pile\r\nimmediately resumes its upright position upon being released. Then, too,\r\nthe dust shakes out of a mohair plush very easily. One rarely sees a\r\ndusty railroad car seat, although the country through which the car is\r\npassing may be very dusty. The rich effect produced by a heavily\r\nupholstered palace car is due to the mohair plush. Nothing has been\r\nfound which will take its place. For furniture upholstering there is\r\nnothing more elegant and durable than mohair plush. The amount of plush\r\nthus used is governed by fashion. In countries where large military\r\nforces are retained there is always a heavy demand for mohair braids.\r\nThere is no braid made which has the luster, combined with the\r\ndurability, which mohair braid possesses. Here it may be stated that a\r\ncoarse yarn can be used in making braids, so that when there is a heavy\r\ndemand for braids there should be a proportionately high price paid for\r\ncoarse long mohair. Mohair braids are always in demand, and will\r\ncontinue to be used upon ladies' clothing, as well as for military\r\nornamental purposes.\r\n\r\nThe variety of uses to which mohair is adapted is almost innumerable. In\r\nthe manufacture of hats it plays an important part, and recently the\r\ndemand for long fiber for the manufacture of wigs, ladies' hair nets and\r\nother toilet articles has been created.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORLD'S SUPPLY AND CONSUMPTION.\r\n\r\nAt present Asia Minor and South Africa can be regarded as the two\r\nleading producers of mohair. The Asia Minor exports vary considerably,\r\naccording to the price allowed, and as no manufactured stuff is\r\nexported, one gets a fair idea of the amount produced. It may be broadly\r\nstated that the Asia Minor clip amounts to about nine million pounds\r\nannually. That of South Africa amounts to about ten million pounds, and\r\nthe United States now produces about one million pounds annually. Of\r\nthis production a very large percentage of that coming from all these\r\ncountries may be regarded as inferior stuff. We mean by this, that the\r\nAngora goat raising industry is yet in its infancy, and that much of the\r\nmohair produced is sheared from goats which have been bred from the\r\ncommon hair variety. Many of the characteristics of the fleece of the\r\ncommon goat still persist in the mohair.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing estimate the world's supply of mohair may be stated\r\nas twenty million pounds annually. Australia is as yet producing only a\r\nvery small amount.\r\n\r\nPractically eighty-five to ninety per cent. of the world's supply of\r\nmohair is handled in Bradford, England. Nearly all of the South African\r\nand Turkish stuff is shipped directly to Bradford, a small amount of the\r\nConstantinople export coming to America, but a large part of the\r\nAmerican import comes from Liverpool, England. At Bradford the raw\r\nmaterial is manufactured, some of the manufactured stuff being exported\r\nas yarn, but the larger part is used to produce the finished article.\r\nThe remaining ten or fifteen per cent. is manufactured in the United\r\nStates. At times the demand for mohair goods stimulates the demand for\r\nraw material, and the United States has been known to use from twenty to\r\ntwenty-five per cent. of the world's supply. To recapitulate, the United\r\nStates produces five per cent. of the world's annual supply of raw\r\nmohair, and manufactures from ten to twenty-five per cent. of the\r\nworld's annual production.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOHAIR PRICES.\r\n\r\nThe price of mohair has fluctuated with the caprice of fashion. Supply\r\nand demand are the essential factors in its valuation, but demand has\r\nbeen so influenced by the requirements of fashion in the past that one\r\nfinds a wide range in price for the raw material. In a report issued by\r\nthe Bradford _Observer_ we find the price ranging from fifty cents a\r\npound in 1856, to eighty cents in 1866, ninety cents in 1876, and then\r\ndown to thirty cents in 1886 and 1896. In 1903 the average price in the\r\nUnited States was about thirty-five cents a pound, and for 1904 about\r\nthirty cents a pound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: READY FOR THE SHEARERS.]\r\n\r\nTo-day there is a demand for mohair, regardless of fashion. During the\r\npast two years the price of raw material has been low, but there has\r\nbeen a margin of profit in the industry, and considering the fact that\r\nfashion's decree has eliminated the manufacture of luster fabrics for\r\nthe present, the mohair producer can feel assured that there will be a\r\nsteady market for his material. With the occasional good times when\r\nluster goods are in demand, the mohair grower should do well.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEARING AND PACKING MOHAIR.\r\n\r\nThe goat should be shorn before he commences to shed, as the mohair\r\nloses its weight and luster after the shedding process begins. There are\r\na few goats, which, under certain kinds of food and climatic conditions,\r\nwill not shed their fleeces, but most goats will shed, and even goats\r\nwhich have carried their fleeces over a year in one section, may shed if\r\nthey are moved a few miles and the food is changed. A class of\r\nnon-shedders would be very valuable, but so far a distinctive class of\r\nnon-shedders, under any and all conditions, and which transmit this\r\npeculiarity, has not been identified. The Angora goat will usually\r\ncommence to shed early in the spring, or as soon as a few warm bright\r\ndays come.\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country it is thought advisable to shear twice a\r\nyear. Many points in favor of this method are advocated. It is claimed\r\nthat the price realized for the two medium length, or short stapled\r\nfleeces, together with the increased number of pounds shorn in the two\r\nclippings a year, pays much better than the one long staple fleece which\r\ncan be shorn from the same animal for a year's growth. There are many\r\nreasons both for and against shearing twice a year. The mills prefer\r\nlong mohair, or at least fiber more than six inches in length (combing\r\nlength). They pay the best price for this class of mohair, and it must\r\nbe left to the individual to decide whether it pays him best to shear\r\nonce or twice a year. At present possibly one-third of the Angoras in\r\nthe United States are shorn twice a year, and the remaining two-thirds\r\nonly once. In Asia Minor one finds the goat shearer using a pair of long\r\nbladed scissors to cut the mohair. The goats are shorn in the spring,\r\nand only once during the year. The animal's feet are tied, and then by\r\nusing both hands, one at either end of the scissors, the goat is shorn.\r\nRecently some Englishman has introduced an ordinary spring sheep shear,\r\nbut most of the natives prefer the scissors.\r\n\r\nTo-day one finds the hand shearer and the machine shearer at work in\r\nAmerica. The hand shearer should use a pair of short bladed (about five\r\ninch blade) sheep shears. This is to prevent the point of the shear from\r\ncutting mohair, which is not intended to be clipped with that\r\nparticular stroke of the shear. If, for instance, the shearer is\r\nclipping the mohair along the sides of the animal, and the point of the\r\nshear cuts some of the mohair at least three inches out from the body,\r\nthis stubble is shorn again (double cut) when the shearer gets to this\r\nplace, and this three-inch mohair is too short to be of much value. It\r\nwill be combed out at the mill as noil. An expert shearer can clip about\r\nthe same number of range goats that he can range sheep--from ninety to\r\none hundred and twenty a day.\r\n\r\nThe machine shear is rapidly taking the place of the hand shear. It\r\nclips the mohair close to the skin and almost does away with double\r\ncutting. It requires less skill to shear with a machine shear, and it\r\ndoes the work more uniformly. There is also less danger of cutting the\r\nanimal. The machines do the work very rapidly.\r\n\r\nAfter the goat is shorn the fleece should be collected and rolled into a\r\nbundle, \"bump,\" and placed in a sack or bale. It should not be tied, as\r\nthe mill men object to the particles of string which remain in the\r\nmohair and disfigure the manufactured product. Any colored fleeces,\r\ndiscolored mohair, or mohair containing objectionable features, such as\r\nburrs, straw, etc., can be placed in separate parcels. The kid mohair\r\ncan be kept by itself, and the wether and doe mohair can be separately\r\npacked. The long mohair should be kept separate from short stuff. Thus\r\none grades the mohair to some extent on the farm, and he has a better\r\nidea of what the clip should bring.\r\n\r\nIf the mohair is to be shipped a long distance, it will pay to bale the\r\nfleeces, as compact bales occupy much less space than sacks. The freight\r\nrates are usually less upon baled mohair than they are upon the sacked\r\nmaterial. The cost of baling the mohair is a little less than the cost\r\nof sacking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBREEDING OF THE ANGORA GOAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne can learn very little about breeding the Angora goat from the Turk.\r\nAs we know from Tchikacheff's work, which was published over fifty years\r\nago, cold winters often killed many of the Angoras in Asia Minor, and\r\nthe Turk then imported from more favored districts common bucks or does\r\nto breed to the Angora. This was before the great demand for mohair,\r\noccasioned by the increase in manufacturing plants at Bradford, England,\r\ncaused the Turkish mohair raisers to resort to all manner of means to\r\nincrease the supply of raw material.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Turk is treading in the paths of his forefathers. What was\r\ngood enough for them, certainly ought to be good enough for him, so he\r\nreasons. He eats with his fingers, cooks on a brazier, sits on the\r\nfloor, eats, drinks, sleeps and works all in the same room, and keeps\r\nhis wives in seclusion.\r\n\r\nWhen he comes to breeding the Angora he leaves that to his servants, if\r\nhe be wealthy enough to have any. Most of the breeders cannot read or\r\nwrite. They have never traveled. They have no ambition, and they know\r\nnothing of the principles of selective breeding. As a natural\r\nconsequence the Angora goat of to-day has not improved, nor is he likely\r\nto improve under Turkish management. One large breeder who supplied\r\nbucks to some tributary country, said that he thought that it was a\r\nshame to castrate a buck, no matter how bad he might be. The Turk\r\nseparates the bucks from the does at breeding season, as Asia Minor has\r\ncold weather late in the spring, and the danger of losing kids, if they\r\ncome too early, is great. When the bucks are turned with the flock they\r\nare allowed to run until the next breeding season, and all of the bucks,\r\nregardless of quality or quantity, are allowed to run with the does.\r\n\r\nWhen the first few Angoras arrived in America the natural procedure was\r\nto cross them upon the common short-haired goat of this country. It was\r\na new industry, and many wanted to try the Angora. Very slowly the\r\nAngora, or the cross-bred animals were scattered over the United States.\r\nStories were told of the wonderful things for which the mohair was used,\r\nand some supposedly reliable authorities quoted mohair at $8.00 a pound,\r\nas has been stated. Companies were started, and of course the supply of\r\ngood Angoras, that is, goats which would shear about four pounds of\r\nmohair (worth at that time about seventy-five cents or a dollar a\r\npound), was limited. Men bought any goat which had a trace of Angora\r\nblood in him as a thoroughbred Angora. A few years, however,\r\ndemonstrated the fact that a common goat, with a little admixture of\r\nAngora blood, did not produce either the quality or the quantity of\r\nfleece wanted. Only a few of the more persistent breeders continued the\r\nexperiment and their investigations. They sent and went to the home of\r\nthe Angora, and brought more of the original animals to America. It took\r\nthe American breeders about thirty years to find out just what the\r\nAngora goat was and how he should be handled. During that thirty years\r\nlarge flocks of common goats, which had been crossed with the Angora,\r\nand which might be properly termed \"grade flocks,\" had been formed. Only\r\na few thoroughbred flocks, that is, flocks of the original Angora, as he\r\ncame from Turkey, were in existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCROSSING WITH THE COMMON SHORT HAIRED GOAT.\r\n\r\nBy experience we have learned that the common short coarse haired goat\r\ncan be crossed with the Angora goat, and that after sufficient crosses\r\nhave been made, the cross-bred Angora so nearly resembles the\r\nthoroughbred that for all practical purposes he is an Angora. We have\r\nalso learned that certain kinds of common goats respond rapidly to the\r\ninfusion of Angora blood, and that others retain certain peculiarities\r\nof the common goat for generations. The Angora will not cross with\r\nsheep. For instance, a common goat with a long mane on the back, or tuft\r\nof long hair behind the foreleg, or on the flank or the hip, will\r\ncontinue to perpetuate this long coarse hair on the offspring for\r\ngenerations, even though the best of Angora blood be infused. The color\r\nof the common goat is of some importance. A brown or reddish brown goat\r\nretains the reddish cast at the base of the mohair much longer than one\r\nof a bluish or bluish black color. It is equally true that a pure white\r\nmother may drop a colored kid occasionally. In Constantinople the mohair\r\nis graded into parcels containing red kemp, black kemp, etc. There it is\r\nthe kemp which retains the color. As has been stated, there is also a\r\nbreed of brown Angora goats, or at least mohair-producing goats, in\r\nKoniah in Asia Minor. Presuming, then, that one has a suitable common\r\ndoe and a good Angora buck as a basis, the following may be deduced as\r\nrelative changes in the different crosses:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PASHA V--A True Breeder.]\r\n\r\nThe first cross, or half-blood Angora, will have a covering of short\r\ncoarse common hair and a thin covering of mohair, which does not grow\r\nvery long. If the animal were to be shorn, possibly a half pound of hair\r\nof a very inferior grade might be yielded. If this hair were to be\r\noffered to a manufacturer, he would class it as noil, and refer it to a\r\ncarpet manufacturer, who would possibly pay ten or twelve cents a pound\r\nfor it. The skin of the animal will be a little fluffy, and not suitable\r\nfor fine goat skin trade. It will not take a good polish after tanning,\r\nand it is not desirable for shoe leather. It will be worth about half as\r\nmuch as common goat skin. The meat of the animal will be a little better\r\nthan that of the common goat, but it will be inferior to Angora venison.\r\nThe animal will still be as prolific as the common goat. Twins and\r\ntriplets will be a common occurrence. The kids will also be hardy. If\r\none were to stop at this stage in breeding, he would have decreased the\r\nvalue of the skin of his goat without increasing the value of the\r\nanimal.\r\n\r\nThe second cross, or the three-quarter blood Angora, will have a\r\ncovering of short coarse common hair, especially noticeable on the back,\r\nbelly, neck and hips. The mohair will now be fairly thickly set upon the\r\nsides of the animal, and of medium length, about seven inches long for a\r\nyear's growth. If the animal were to be examined by a novice, he would\r\nbe called an Angora from his general appearance. If shorn, he will yield\r\nabout one, or one and a half pounds of hair, and the mohair manufacturer\r\nwill pay about twelve or fifteen cents a pound for the material. The\r\nskin is valueless for rug, robe or trimming purposes, because of the\r\ncoarse back and the scanty covering of mohair. It is fit for glove\r\nleather after tanning, but its value for this purpose is less than that\r\nof the common goat. The meat is more like Angora venison, and can be\r\nsold on the market as mutton. The animal is still prolific. From the\r\nsecond cross on, the grade goat rapidly assumes the characteristic of\r\nthe Angora goat, but if for any reason poor bucks are used (an\r\noccasional animal without apparent reason retrogrades), the animal as\r\nrapidly resumes the characteristic of the common goat. Quite a\r\npercentage of colored kids will be dropped by does which are themselves\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThe third cross, or seven-eighths blood Angora, will still have the\r\ncoarse back, a partially bare belly, coarse hips, and the neck will be\r\ninsufficiently covered. The sides will be covered with good quality,\r\nlong staple mohair, comparatively free from the coarse, dead underhair,\r\nor kemp. The animal will shear about two or three pounds of fair mohair,\r\nwhich will be worth from twenty to thirty cents a pound. This mohair\r\nwill be fit to run through the combs, and the \"top,\" or long mohair,\r\nfree from kemp, will be used in the manufacture of plushes, braids, etc.\r\nThe skin will have some value for rug, robe and trimming purposes. The\r\nmeat will be juicy, palatable and salable as mutton.\r\n\r\nThe fourth cross, or fifteen-sixteenths blood Angora, will be hardly\r\ndistinguishable from the average thoroughbred Angora. The coarse back\r\nwill persist to some extent, and the hip will be plentifully covered\r\nwith kemp. A good many of this grade will be poorly covered on the\r\nbelly, and an occasional bare necked or off colored animal will be\r\ndropped. The animal will shear from two and a half to five pounds of\r\nmohair of good quality, which will be worth from twenty-five to\r\nthirty-five cents a pound. It will be from eight to twelve inches long\r\nat a year's growth, and it will be combed at the mill. It is fit for\r\nmanufacturing into any of the goods for which mohair is used. The meat\r\nof the animal is rich, juicy, and free from the disagreeable qualities\r\nso often noticeable in mutton. If the animal be fed upon browse, the\r\nmeat will have the flavor of venison. The tendency of the mothers to\r\ndrop twins will be lessened, and it will be rather the exception for\r\ntwins to be born. The kids will be rather delicate when dropped.\r\n\r\nSubsequent crosses will tend to reduce the amount of kemp upon the\r\nanimal and to improve the back. The question will now resolve itself\r\ninto one of breeding for points. Bucks must be selected which cover the\r\npoints the does need most, and by careful selection the grade flock will\r\nsoon be indistinguishable from the thoroughbreds.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS USED IN AMERICA TO-DAY.\r\n\r\nBy gradual steps the original Angoras imported into America have been so\r\nimproved, and the cross-bloods have been so highly graded that some of\r\nthe American flocks equal the best Turkish flocks. America has many\r\nhigh-grade flocks, which, if it were not for the remaining coarse hair\r\nof the common goat, would be upon a par with the Turkish flocks. There\r\nare enough good goats in the country for a foundation stock, and a few\r\nyears more of the careful, painstaking, selective breeding which is in\r\nprogress throughout the United States to-day, will bring forth an Angora\r\nsuperior to the Turkish stock. Sections of the country modify the\r\ncharacteristics of the Angora. Probably climatic conditions, varieties\r\nof food and water, and certainly mental vigor of the owners is largely\r\nresponsible for this. One man selects large, well formed, rapidly\r\nmaturing goats and breeds for this type. It is surprising how soon his\r\nflocks assume this type. Another breeder works for fineness of fleece,\r\nregardless of size or shape of the animal, and he gets his points.\r\n\r\nThere has been much vagueness as to what points the breeder should try\r\nto produce. Some have claimed that the most profitable animal to raise\r\nwas one producing heavy ringletty fleece, regardless of the quality of\r\nthe fleece, except of course that it should be as free from kemp as\r\npossible. This day has passed. We know what the mohair is used for, and\r\nknow how it is prepared for manufacturing. The future may change these\r\nuses or methods, but we know what we want now, and we know how to breed\r\nour goats to produce the most money per head for the present at least.\r\nFashions vary, and the fashions vary the demand for certain grades of\r\nmohair. Coarse fibered, long staple, fine luster mohair possessing a\r\ngreat amount of tensile strength and elasticity will make good braid\r\nyarns, but if braid yarns are not in demand, such fiber is not the best\r\nfor plush or dress yarns. Fine fibered, long staple, pliable, lustrous,\r\neasily spun yarn can be used for braid stuff, or at least part of the\r\nfleece will be heavy enough for this purpose, and the finer parts have\r\nsuch a variety of uses that they spin yarns which are always in demand.\r\nLooking at the question from the manufacturing standpoint, we see that\r\nthe most staple product is the fine-fibered mohair. But a producer might\r\nhave animals which would shear two and a half pounds average (the\r\naverage of the Turkish flocks) of very fine mohair, while another grower\r\nmight have animals which would shear four or five pounds average of\r\ncoarse mohair. And even though the value per pound of the coarse mohair\r\nmay be considerably less than that of the fine mohair, the grower owning\r\nthe coarse haired heavy shearing Angoras will realize more money per\r\nhead for his clip. The value also of the carcass and skin of the Angora\r\nis of importance. A heavy carcass and a large skin are of more value\r\nthan a light carcass and a small skin.\r\n\r\nIf the Angora breeder would produce the animal which will yield the most\r\nmoney per head, he should aim to produce an animal which will shear the\r\nheaviest fleece of the most marketable mohair, regardless of fashions,\r\nand one which, when put upon the market, will dress the most possible\r\npounds of desirable meat, and yield a readily marketable skin. There are\r\nnot many such animals on the market to-day, but the time when there will\r\nbe plenty is coming. We have the fineness of fiber; we have the density\r\nof weight of fleece; we have the covering of the animal and the size and\r\nstamina of the individual, and we have breeders who are endeavoring to\r\nunite combinations to produce the Angora of the future. But while we are\r\nwithout the ideal, one should choose that point which is hardest to\r\nattain, most necessary for the best paying animal, and work especially\r\nfor that. That point is fineness of fiber, always remembering freeness\r\nfrom kemp. There are many large goats, many heavy shearing goats, but\r\nthere are very few fine fibered comparatively free from kemp goats. One\r\nshould not make the mistake of neglecting size and weight of fleece.\r\nThere are few animals which will respond more rapidly to careful\r\ncrossing than the Angora goat. A buck will usually stamp his\r\nindividuality upon every kid, hence the necessity of carefully selecting\r\nbreeding stock.\r\n\r\n\r\nGESTATION.\r\n\r\nThe period of gestation varies slightly with the individual, but the\r\naverage may be approximately stated as one hundred and forty-seven days,\r\nor about five months. Both the bucks and the does have a breeding\r\nseason, but this season may be changed or varied by different elements.\r\nAs a rule the bucks commence to rut about July or August here in\r\nAmerica, and the does soon after the time the bucks commence. Some bucks\r\nwhich have been allowed to run with the does all of the time, never\r\ncease rutting, and the does conceive about every six months. The does\r\ncome in heat about every fourteen days, and remain in this condition for\r\nabout three days. If the bucks are allowed to run with the does, one\r\nbuck should be used for about every fifty does. If the buck is only\r\nallowed to serve the doe once, a grown animal will serve one hundred and\r\nfifty does in forty days without permanent injury to himself. The does\r\nconceive at about the age of seven months, and the bucks breed at about\r\nthe same age, but the wise breeder will not sacrifice the individual by\r\ninterfering with its development. Both the buck and the doe should not\r\nbe bred until they are at least a year old. The bucks should be fed at\r\nbreeding season, and if one has a sufficient number of bucks, it is well\r\nto turn the bucks with the does in relays. It is advisable to have the\r\nkids start coming slowly, so that one may get new men trained to handle\r\nthem properly. One or two bucks turned with a flock of a thousand does\r\nfor a few days, and then removed and allowed to rest, and a new relay of\r\nthree or more bucks turned with the does, to be removed in a few days,\r\nand a new relay being introduced into the flock, will do more\r\nsatisfactory work than they would if all of the bucks were turned in at\r\none time. The same principle can be applied to smaller flocks. The does\r\nshould be protected from cold storms or rough handling when they are\r\nheavy with kid, else they are liable to abort. If for any unusual cause\r\nthe doe aborts one season, there is no reason why she will not carry her\r\nkid until full term another time, and experience has proven that she\r\nwill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PASHA V AND BISMARCK.\r\n\r\nAmerican bred bucks, Bismarck shearing 12 pounds, was the sire of the\r\ngrand champion buck at the St. Louis World's Fair, 1904.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBREEDING OF REGISTERED STOCK.\r\n\r\nThe breeding of registered stock, or stock of known ancestry, requires\r\nmuch care and quite different handling. Both the does and the bucks must\r\nbe marked with an ear tag, brand, tattoo number, or some other permanent\r\nindividual mark, and the kids should be marked at birth. Fifty known\r\ndoes may be put in a pasture or pen and a known buck put with them. He\r\nshould be allowed to run with them at least forty days. After this the\r\ndoes may be collected into a flock and several bucks turned with them,\r\nbut only the kids which are dropped from a known buck are fit for\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\nA more accurate method, and one which can be used with a large flock, is\r\nto place the bucks in a corral adjoining the one used by the does at\r\nnight. The does should be brought into their corral early in the\r\nevening, and all of those in heat will work along the fence next to the\r\nbucks. The doe in heat can be caught and the number taken and recorded\r\nin a book. She is then placed in a small pen with a buck and his number\r\nis recorded with hers, together with the date. If the doe does not\r\nconceive, she can be put with the same buck again at a later date, and\r\none has approximate knowledge of when she should drop her kid. In this\r\nmanner a buck will serve about two or three does in the evening, and one\r\nor two in the morning. The kid is marked at birth and the number\r\nrecorded after that of the mother. The breeding of recorded stock is of\r\nvalue only for special reasons, and is not advisable with large flocks,\r\nas it is expensive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANGORA VENISON.\r\n\r\n\r\nAngora venison is the name which should be given to the flesh of the\r\nAngora goat. At the present time it is usually sold in the markets as\r\nmutton. The term goat meat should be applied to meat of the common goat,\r\nand the term mutton belongs to sheep. Because the Angora goat feeds\r\nlargely upon that material which nourishes the deer, the meat of the\r\nAngora is flavored like venison. The fat is well distributed, and the\r\nhealthfulness of the animal renders this an especially desirable meat.\r\nThe Turk has long recognized Angora venison as an important element in\r\nhis diet. Angora kid is above comparison, and it occupies the principle\r\nplace on the menu at private as well as state affairs in the Orient. As\r\none passes through the market places in Asia Minor he sees the carcasses\r\nof the Angora hanging in every shop. There is no mistaking the animal,\r\nas the skin still remains on the goat. One takes his choice, and as a\r\nrule more Angora venison than mutton is sold. Some of the Turks keep\r\ntheir wethers until they become coarse-haired and too old to pay to keep\r\nlonger, eight or ten years old. This class of meat ranks with old\r\nmutton, and sells at a discount. Young wethers and does are in good\r\ndemand. There has existed in America some prejudice against the flesh of\r\nthe goat. To-day thousands of goats are being consumed annually, but\r\nmost of them are sold as mutton. Packers and butchers still insist that\r\nAngora venison must be sold as mutton. They pay about one-half a cent to\r\na cent a pound less for the goat than for sheep.\r\n\r\nThe goat never fattens as well along the back as the sheep, and hence\r\nthe carcass does not look so well. The fat is more evenly distributed\r\nthroughout the animal in the goat. An expert once said that to know\r\nwhether a goat was fat one should feel the brisket, and if there was a\r\nconsiderable layer of adipose tissue between the skin and the breast\r\nbone, the animal was fat.\r\n\r\nSome of the American breeders do not send their wethers to market until\r\nthey get too old to produce valuable fleeces. The animals are then\r\nslaughtered when they have grown a half year's fleece, and the skins are\r\nreserved by the breeder. These skins are valuable, and help to bring up\r\nthe average price of the goat.\r\n\r\nAt present some of the packers recognize no difference between shorn and\r\nunshorn goats. The price is the same, so it pays to shear the goats\r\nbefore bringing them to market. There is absolutely no strong flavor in\r\nprime Angora venison, and this is where the meat differs from that of\r\nthe common goat.\r\n\r\nThe goat is a slow grower, and not until the second year do the bones\r\nossify. Therefore, a two-year-old can be sold for lamb, as he has a\r\n\"soft joint.\" Grown Angora wethers do not average much more than one\r\nhundred pounds as a rule, although there are occasional bands sold which\r\naverage one hundred and fifteen pounds.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that Angora venison will never supplant mutton, but it\r\nwill have its place among the edible meats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANGORA BUCK--Early Importation.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANGORA GOAT SKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Angora goat skin differs considerably from the skin of the common\r\ngoat. In the first place the Angora skin is covered with more or less\r\nmohair; and in the second place, the texture of the skin itself is\r\ndifferent. The skin of the common goat is firm, and the different layers\r\nare so closely united that they cannot be separated. The layers of the\r\nAngora skin are not so closely united, and the skin is slightly fluffy.\r\nThe outer layer of this skin peels off when it is used. The Angora skin\r\nis valuable both with the fleece on and without it. Its principle value,\r\nhowever, is with the fleece on. After the skins have been properly\r\ntanned, they are used for rugs, robes, trimmings, and imitating various\r\nfurs. When ladies' and children's Angora furs are in style, these skins\r\nbecome very valuable for this purpose. One skin has cut $17.00 worth of\r\ntrimming at wholesale. Of course, the value of the skins depends upon\r\nthe quality and character of the mohair with which the skins are\r\ncovered, and their size. Large, well covered skins are always scarce and\r\ncommand good prices. They are worth from $1.00 to $2.00 each. Most of\r\nthe Asia Minor skins are sent to Austria, and the prices paid for the\r\nraw skins are about the same as in America. The skins which have had the\r\nmohair removed are valuable for the manufacture of gloves and morocco\r\nleather. They do not make as fine leather as the common goat skins, but\r\nthey are as extensively used. All skins should be carefully handled.\r\n\r\nThe skin should be carefully removed from the carcass. Goats do not skin\r\nas easily as sheep, and the careless operator is liable to cut the inner\r\nlayers of the skin if he is not careful. These cuts are called\r\n\"flesh-cuts,\" and skins badly \"flesh-cut\" are comparatively valueless,\r\nbecause \"flesh-cuts\" can not be removed by the tanner. A sharp knife\r\nshould be used, and the operator should avoid cutting the skin.\r\n\r\nThe skin should be well salted, care being taken to see that the salt\r\npenetrates every portion of the raw surface. The skins can be cured in\r\nthe shade without the use of salt, but sun-dried skins are worthless. If\r\nthe edges of the skin are allowed to roll, so that raw surfaces come\r\ntogether, the part so affected will heat and the hair pull out. It is\r\nnot necessary to stretch the skins while curing them.\r\n\r\nGoats should be killed when their fleece is suitable for robe and rug\r\npurposes. Those carrying a six month's fleece, if it is six inches long,\r\nhave about the right kind of skins. There are some Angora skins imported\r\nfrom Turkey and South Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prize winners at the Columbian Exposition, Chicago,\r\n1893.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBY-PRODUCTS OF ANGORA GOATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Angora goat should not be classed with milch animals. As a rule the\r\ndoes give a sufficient amount of milk to nourish the kid or kids. The\r\nmore common blood there is in the goat the better milch animal she is.\r\nHowever, some Angoras have been milked, and the milk is as rich as that\r\nof the common goat. A quart of milk a day may be considered a fair\r\naverage for a fresh milch Angora doe. It has been suggested that because\r\nthe milk of the goat contains a heavy percentage of fat, it is a proper\r\nsubstitute for mothers' milk for babies. This is probably a mistake, as\r\nthat part of the milk which is the hardest for the baby to digest is the\r\nprotein, and it will be observed that in the following table of analysis\r\nsubmitted, the percentage of protein in goat's milk and in cow's milk is\r\nabout the same, and that it is considerably larger than in mother's\r\nmilk. A very desirable feature in goat's milk is that the fat is\r\ndistributed throughout the milk, and that it does not readily separate\r\nfrom the milk. This would assist in the assimilation of the fat by an\r\ninfant. Some experiments made with coffee demonstrate that it requires\r\nhalf the quantity of goat's milk to produce the same effect upon this\r\nbeverage which cow's milk produces. This may be partially explained by\r\nthe quantity of fat in goat's milk, and partially by the fact that the\r\nfat does not readily separate from the milk. The bottom of the can is as\r\ngood as the top.\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF MILK.\r\n\r\n                    MOTHER'S  COW'S    GOAT'S\r\n                     AVERAGE  AVERAGE  AVERAGE\r\n\r\n    Fat               4.00    3.50      7.30\r\n    Sugar             7.00    4.30      4.10\r\n    Proteid           1.50    4.00      4.18\r\n    Salts              .20     .70      1.21\r\n    Water            87.30   87.50     83.21\r\n                    ------  ------    ------\r\n                    100.00  100.00    100.00\r\n\r\nPersons in poor health have been greatly benefitted by the use of goat's\r\nmilk. This is probably due to the fact that the fat in the milk is so\r\ndistributed that a large percentage of it is taken up by the digestive\r\napparatus. Angora goats are docile, and it is possible that some of them\r\ncould be developed into good milch animals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERTILIZER.\r\n\r\nIt is a known fact that packers of the present day utilize all of the\r\ncarcass of most food animals, but it is not the fertilizer which the\r\npacker makes from the blood and offal of the goat which we shall\r\nconsider here.\r\n\r\nSheep's manure has been used for years on orchards and vegetable\r\ngardens, and in the last few years goats' manure has been in demand,\r\nselling at from $6 to $7.50 a ton, depending upon the purity of the\r\nfertilizer. It must be remembered that only a small portion of this\r\nmanure is dropped at the night bed-ground, the balance is evenly\r\ndistributed over the land upon which the goats are feeding. The goats\r\nnot only rid the farm of objectionable weeds and brush, but they help to\r\nfurnish a rich soil in which grass will grow. This fact has been so\r\nthoroughly demonstrated that western farmers, who have large tracts of\r\nwheat or barley stubble to rent during the summer, are always anxious to\r\nget goats upon this land.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER PRODUCTS.\r\n\r\nThe horns of the goats are used to make handles for pocket knives, etc.\r\nThe hoofs are used in the manufacture of glue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD, CLIMATE AND PROTECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the mountains and in the valleys of the United States the Angora has\r\nhad a variety of food. He is a natural browser, and will live almost\r\nentirely on brush, if this kind of food is to be found, but he readily\r\nadapts himself to circumstances, and will live and do well upon an\r\nexclusively grass diet. The fact that the goat is a browser has been\r\nmade use of in clearing farms of brush and objectional weeds. If a\r\nsufficient number of goats are confined upon a limited area for a period\r\nof time, they will kill most of the brush upon this land. They will eat\r\nalmost every kind of brush, but they have their preferences and enjoy\r\nespecially blackberry vines and those kinds of brush which contain\r\ntannic acid, such as scrub oak. They do not poison easily, and if there\r\nis a variety of food they rarely eat enough of any kind of poisonous\r\nplant to prove fatal. If, however, they are hungry, and have access to\r\nplaces where there are poisonous plants, they will eat enough to kill\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nKILLING BRUSH.\r\n\r\nIf one wishes to clear brush land, he should confine the goats to a\r\ncomparatively small tract. The goats kill the shrubs by eating the\r\nleaves and by peeling the bark from the branches and trunks of the\r\ntrees. The brush thus deprived of lungs, soon dies and the roots rot. As\r\nfast as the leaves grow they must be consumed, so it is well to allow\r\nthe goats to eat most of the leaves off of a limited tract, and then in\r\norder to give the goats plenty of feed, they should be moved to another\r\nfield. As soon as the leaves on the first tract have regrown the goats\r\nshould be again confined to this land. In this way the leaves are\r\ncontinually destroyed. This process can be continued as fast as the\r\nleaves regrow. By this method it is estimated that a bunch of one\r\nhundred to one hundred and fifty goats will clear forty acres of thick\r\nbrush in about two years. In countries where the grass grows as the\r\nbrush dies, goats will eat some of this grass, but they prefer the\r\nbrowse.\r\n\r\nOn some of the older goat ranches, where the Angora has been raised\r\nexclusively for the mohair and mutton, it has become quite a problem to\r\nprevent the goats from killing out the brush. The goats have done well\r\nwhere other kinds of livestock would have starved, but as soon as the\r\nbrush is killed the land produces almost nothing, and even the goats\r\ncannot make a living. To prevent as far as possible their killing the\r\nbrush the flocks are moved frequently from one range to another, so that\r\nthe shrubs have a chance to recuperate between visits. In this way\r\nbrush can be kept almost indefinitely for the goats. On some of the\r\nwestern ranges, where cattle and sheep have, by continual cropping,\r\nkilled much of the grass, good browse remains. These ranges would have\r\nto be abandoned if it were not for the goat. Goats do not in any way\r\ninterfere with the pasturage of cattle or other livestock. Cattle feed\r\ncontentedly on the same range with the goats, and this fact has led many\r\nsouthern cattle men to invest in goats. The goats are herded on the\r\nbrushy lands, and the cattle range over the same territory and eat the\r\ngrass. Horses have a great fondness for goats.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALT.\r\n\r\nGoats, like other livestock, should have a small amount of salt. The\r\nsalt should be kept where they can get it at liberty, or else it should\r\nbe fed at regular intervals. If ground salt is given, care should be\r\ntaken to see that individuals do not eat an oversupply of the salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\nWhile Angoras do not require as much water as sheep, yet they should be\r\ngiven a quantity sufficient at least once a day. In winter goats will\r\nlive upon snow. Men have reported that their goats have gone for a week\r\nat a time, and all summer long, without any more moisture than they\r\ncould get from browse and weeds, but even if Angoras should stand this\r\ntreatment, they will thrive better with water once daily. It is\r\nestimated that under normal conditions a goat will consume about\r\none-ninetieth of its body weight (about a pint of water for a grown\r\nanimal) in a day. On hot days, when the animals are on dry feed, they\r\nwill frequently drink two quarts of water.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEDS.\r\n\r\nTo raise Angora goats most profitably one should really be provided with\r\nsheds. These sheds should be about the same as those which are provided\r\nfor sheep in the same locality. For years southern and western breeders\r\nhave made a success of the Angora industry, and very few of them have\r\nhad any artificial protection for their goats. But even these breeders\r\nfind that they can raise a larger percentage of increase, and get\r\nthrough the year with a smaller percentage of loss if they have sheds.\r\nGrown goats rarely need much shelter, even in the winter, if the weather\r\nis dry, but during cold, damp storms the fleece wets through and the\r\nanimal chills. Just after shearing, or just before kidding season, one\r\nis liable to lose some grown animals, or to have many kids slunk, if the\r\ngoats are not protected from cold storms. Young kids also require\r\nattention, and proper sheds more than pay for themselves by preventing\r\nexcessive mortality. Whether the shed should be closed on all sides, or\r\nwhether it may be left open, depends upon the locality. Do as one would\r\nfor sheep, under the same conditions, will be a fairly safe rule to\r\nfollow. Allow at least four or five square feet of shed room to each\r\nmature animal, and the danger of the goats crowding together in the\r\ncorners and smothering the animals on the underside of the pile, should\r\nnever be forgotten. On very cold nights large numbers, especially of the\r\nkids, may be killed by smothering, if they are not carefully watched.\r\n\r\n\r\nFENCES.\r\n\r\nThe question of fencing for the Angora goat is not such a serious matter\r\nas the beginner would imagine. If the goats have not been raised as pets\r\nand taught to jump, there will be little trouble with the animals going\r\nover a perpendicular fence of ordinary height. They will, however, go\r\nthrough or under the fence, if it is possible. They are natural\r\nclimbers, and if the fence offers projecting steps, upon which they can\r\nclimb, they will soon find their way to the outside of the enclosure.\r\nSome of the old stone and rail fences will not hold goats. Any\r\nperpendicular fence, three feet high, with transverse spaces not wider\r\nthan three or four inches for the lower two feet, and not wider than six\r\ninches for the upper foot, will hold goats. If the spaces in the fence\r\nare perpendicular, they will necessarily have to be narrower, as small\r\nkids will crawl through the spaces. A woven-wire fence, two feet high,\r\nwith a perpendicular stay, at least twelve inches apart, so that the\r\ngoats will not get their heads caught in the fence, surmounted by a\r\ncouple of plain or barbed wires, six inches apart, will hold goats, and\r\nif barbed wire is used, will prevent cattle from breaking the fence. If\r\nplain or barbed wire is used, the first three wires nearest the ground\r\nshould be placed not more than three inches apart, and close enough to\r\nthe ground to prevent kids from crawling under the lowest wire. The\r\nspace between the next wires may be increased to four, five and six\r\ninches, and so on to the desired height of the fence. A board fence\r\ncomposed of three boards four inches wide, with a space between the\r\nground and the first board of about three inches, and a three or four\r\ninch space between the boards, the whole being surmounted by a barbed or\r\nplain wire or two makes a very satisfactory goat fence. If pickets or\r\nposts are used, they should be set closely enough together, say about\r\ntwo inches apart, to prevent small kids from crawling between them. An\r\nobjection has been raised to barbed wire, on account of the mohair which\r\nthe barbs pull out. The amount of mohair lost in this way is\r\ninconsiderable. As has been stated, it hurts the goat to pull the\r\nmohair, and the goat soon learns to avoid the barbs. Many breeders use\r\nbarbed wire corrals and find them satisfactory. Probably woven wire is\r\nthe best fence under ordinary conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nHERDING.\r\n\r\nIn mountainous countries, where it is not practical to fence the range,\r\nthe flocks should be watched by herders. The Angora has a natural\r\ntendency to return home, or to a known camping ground at night, and in\r\nsome places this tendency is relied upon to bring the flock home, and\r\nthey are not herded. Of course, in countries where there is no danger\r\nfrom loss by depredations of wild animals, and where food is so\r\nplentiful that the goats must find a sufficient amount, the flock may be\r\nturned loose.\r\n\r\nOne shepherd should tend from one to two thousand head, as goats flock\r\ntogether well. Of course, during kidding season the flocks will have to\r\nbe more closely watched. Goats travel rapidly and cover a considerable\r\namount of territory in a day. A flock may travel from ten to twelve\r\nmiles from the time they leave camp in the morning until they return to\r\ncamp in the evening. The herder should walk ahead of the leaders of the\r\nflock, so that they will not travel too fast, or he may walk upon a\r\nnearby elevation, so that he can see that the flock does not separate. A\r\nflock will sometimes string out over a mile. The goats should be given\r\nfreedom. Too often a zealous herder overworks himself and keeps his\r\nflock poor by crowding them together. A good sheep herder soon learns\r\nthe nature of the goat, and when he understands the animal he would\r\nrather herd goats than sheep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prize winners at the St. Louis World's Fair, 1904.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDOGS.\r\n\r\nIn some sections of the country sheep-killing dogs have proven a great\r\nnuisance to sheep-breeders. To say that the Angora goat will prevent\r\ndogs from killing sheep, and that they will drive the dogs away, would\r\nbe a misstatement. Bucks and grown goats will protect themselves to some\r\nextent. If a strange dog attacks a flock in a field, the goats will\r\nusually huddle together and the bucks and grown animals will keep the\r\ndog at bay. A mother will fight bravely to protect her kid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKIDDING ANGORAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn experience of years has taught the Turk that if he wishes to save\r\nmany kids, he must have them come late in the season. The changeable\r\nweather of the Turkish spring, the frequent cold rains and the lack of\r\nproper shed accommodations, have more than once not only destroyed the\r\nincrease, but also killed the grown goats. The Turkish methods of\r\nhandling kids are of little practical value. They know how delicate the\r\nkids are when they are born, and they usually bring the kid and its\r\nmother to the house as soon as it is dropped.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish Angora goat men usually range small flocks, and they also\r\nhave a surplus of help, so that this is a comparatively easy method. The\r\nkids are allowed to go with the flocks as soon as they are old enough to\r\ntravel. The principal objection to letting young kids go with the flock\r\nis that the kids go to sleep, and sleep so soundly that the flock feed\r\naway from them. When the youngsters awake they are lost. If there be\r\nwild animals about, the kids may be killed, or they may starve before\r\nthey are found. The Turk, however, has so many herders with one flock\r\nthat they usually discover the kids before the flock has strayed.\r\n\r\nIn America the kidding season is the most important time of the year for\r\nthe Angora breeder. If he would raise a large increase, he must be\r\nproperly prepared, and he must be constantly alert. If the weather be\r\nfair, with bright sunshiny days and temperate nights, the kids will do\r\nwell without much care, but if it be cold, stormy and muddy, some of the\r\nkids will be lost in spite of all care. After the kids are born the\r\nmothers should have such food as will produce the greatest amount of\r\nmilk. Well-fed mothers make strong healthy kids. Green feed is\r\ndesirable.\r\n\r\nThe proper season, then, for the kids to come will depend upon the\r\nclimate and range conditions. Allowing for the period of gestation,\r\nwhich is about five months, the bucks can run with the does as early or\r\nas late as one wishes. One can be guided somewhat by the time sheep men\r\nallow ewes to lamb. When the first warm weather comes the goats usually\r\ncommence to shed their mohair, and as it is too early in the season for\r\nthe kids to be dropped, the does must be shorn before kidding or the\r\nmohair lost. Care should be exercised in handling the does heavy with\r\nkid. For the first few days after shearing the doe should not be allowed\r\nto chill, as she may abort. In some countries it is possible to kid\r\nbefore shearing, but there is no practical objection to shearing before\r\nkidding, provided proper care be exercised.\r\n\r\n\r\nHANDLING OF KIDS.\r\n\r\nThere are various methods in use of handling the young kids, and all of\r\nthem are intended to save as large a percentage of increase as possible\r\nwith the least possible expense. Almost every man who has handled goats\r\nhas some individual idea which experience has taught him. The locality\r\nand surroundings of the flock make a vast difference in the way they\r\nshould be kidded. The method which works best with fifty or one hundred\r\ndoes in a fenced brush pasture in Oregon or Iowa, would be useless with\r\na flock of a thousand or fifteen hundred in the mountains of Nevada or\r\nNew Mexico, where there is often no corral to hold the goats.\r\n\r\nWith a bunch of from fifty, to two hundred and fifty, and a shed big\r\nenough to hold the entire lot, it is not difficult to raise a very large\r\npercentage of kids. If the does are kept in a ten or twenty-acre\r\npasture, they should be allowed to run out and take care of themselves\r\nas much as possible. The doe may drop her kid wherever she may happen to\r\nbe, and she will almost invariably take care of it and coax it to the\r\nshed at night. The refusal of a young doe to own her kid must be\r\novercome, especially if the weather is unfavorable. The mother must be\r\ncaught and the milk forced into the kid's mouth until he learns to\r\nsuckle. After he has been sufficiently fed, place them together in a box\r\nstall and leave them for a day or two. Then, in all probability, the\r\nmother will take care of her kid.\r\n\r\nThe box stall is about three feet square and three feet high, with a\r\nlittle door on hinges to save lifting the animal. A row along the inside\r\nof the shed next to the wall is a great convenience. A doe with her kid\r\nshould be disturbed as little as possible, because, as a rule, she knows\r\nhow to care for her kid better than a herder.\r\n\r\nWhen goats are handled on a larger scale, with no pasture available,\r\nentirely different methods should be adopted--for the mother must go out\r\nto feed every day and the kid cannot go.\r\n\r\nProbably the most extensively used methods are the \"corral method\" and\r\nthe \"staking method,\" either used individually or combined.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CORRAL METHOD.\r\n\r\nIn the corral method, two or three large corrals and numerous smaller\r\nones are necessary. First, the does should be separated from the\r\nwethers, if they have been running together, and a \"wether band\" made.\r\nThen every morning the \"doe band\" must be looked over carefully for does\r\nthat will kid during the day. Such does must be put in a corral by\r\nthemselves and allowed to kid in this corral. They should be fed some\r\nhay, or if that is not possible, they should be herded near by for a few\r\nhours. It has been our experience that most of the kids will come\r\nbetween the hours of ten in the morning and four in the afternoon. The\r\nmore does which one can pick out in the morning the better it is, for\r\nthe doe, after dropping her kid, is allowed to stay with it the rest of\r\nthe day and all night. In this way she learns to know it. If one has hay\r\nto feed the doe, so that she may be left with her kid for one or two\r\ndays, it is a great advantage.\r\n\r\nAfter all the does have been selected which can be found, still some\r\nwill be overlooked, and they will go out on the range with the rest. The\r\nbest way to handle these is to have the herder make a straight drive to\r\na certain point where the feed is good, and then stay around this one\r\nplace, allowing the kids to come within as small a radius as possible\r\nwithout starving the goats. If it is necessary, quite a distance can be\r\ncovered in this way, and yet the kids will not be scattered over a large\r\nsection of the country.\r\n\r\nAs a kid is dropped, the doe should be allowed to remain with her kid\r\nand take care of it until evening. The herd will gradually feed from\r\nthem, but it should be kept as near as possible to protect the kids from\r\nwild animals. Towards evening one must go out and gather up the kids and\r\ndrive the mothers to the corral. The large herd should be driven home\r\nin advance, keeping a little apart from the does with kids so as not to\r\ncoax the \"wet does\" away with the \"dry herd.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the wagon with the kids reaches the ranch, the kids should be put\r\nin a small corral. They should be placed a few feet apart, and the\r\nmothers should be allowed to select their own kids. They also should be\r\nallowed to remain in the corral for the night at least. In case a doe\r\nwill not take her kid she should be placed in one of the box stalls and\r\na kid which has no mother placed with her and fed.\r\n\r\nWhen plenty of small corrals and good hay are available, each day's kids\r\nshould be left in a separate corral until the mothers have been with the\r\nkids one or two days. It will be found that the kids are always given a\r\nvery good start in this way. When it is deemed advisable, the kids are\r\nput together in a large corral, and as soon as the mothers in the\r\nsmaller corrals are thought to know their kids sufficiently well, they\r\nare added to this wet band in the large corral. Thus the round is\r\ncompleted from the dry band to the wet band, the small corral being\r\nsimply an intermediate step to insure familiarity between the doe and\r\nher kid. The dry band rapidly diminishes while the wet band increases.\r\n\r\nThe mothers are now ready to go on the range during the day to feed, but\r\nthe kids should be kept in the corral until they are at least six weeks\r\nold. The does may be turned out over a \"jump board\" placed across the\r\ngate. A jump board is a two-inch plank, eighteen inches high, with a\r\nfour-inch strip nailed on the top for the does to put their feet on as\r\nthey jump over. The kids come to the board but cannot get over. If some\r\nof the larger kids bother by trying to get over, some one can stand at\r\nthe gate to scare them back by pounding on the board with a stick. The\r\ndoes will soon learn to pay no attention to the noise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOROUGHBRED ANGORA DOE.]\r\n\r\nEven now there will be a few kids which will not be mothered. Every\r\nmorning, before the wet band is allowed to go over the jump board, one\r\nshould walk through the herd, pick out the kids that have not been\r\nnourished during the night, and select does that are not suckling kids.\r\nThese does should be held until the kids have been fed. A row of small\r\nstantions is a convenient thing for holding them. After a kid gets a\r\ngood start he will steal a living from different does if necessary.\r\n\r\nTo kid a band of from one thousand to fifteen hundred does by the corral\r\nmethod, will require at least three men--one man to herd the dry band,\r\none the wet band, and a man to look after the kids and assist where\r\nneeded. Often the wet band is divided, or when one wet band has reached\r\nthe number of from five hundred to seven hundred animals, another is\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STAKING METHOD.\r\n\r\nThe staking method is quite commonly used, and in certain localities it\r\nis probably the best way to handle kids. The apparatus necessary is a\r\nsmooth piece of half-inch board, two inches wide and four inches long,\r\nwith a hole bored in each end. Through the hole in one end a piece of\r\nrope eight inches long is passed, and knotted so that it cannot pull\r\nout. The loose end of this rope is then made fast to a stout stake which\r\nis to be driven into the ground. Through the hole in the other end a\r\npiece of rope eighteen inches long is passed and knotted as in the first\r\nend, in such a way that the loose end of the rope, which is to be\r\nfastened to the kid's leg, draws away from the stake. When the apparatus\r\nis in use the small stick with the holes in the ends acts as a swivel to\r\nkeep the rope from tangling.\r\n\r\nIt is important to select a proper place to tie the kid. He is to stay\r\nin this place for about six weeks, and he needs protection from winds\r\nand wild animals, and should have some sunshine and some shade. Usually\r\na small tree, a bush, a fence, or a post will offer a good place to\r\nstake. The does which are expected to kid during the day are separated\r\nfrom the flock as in the corral method. The balance of the band are\r\nherded, so that the kids dropped on the range can be more easily\r\nhandled. Just as soon as a kid is dropped, it is taken to a convenient\r\nplace to stake, and the mother coaxed to follow. One of the kid's legs\r\nis securely fastened to the loose end of the rope, and the kid and its\r\nmother are left together. The mother is thus free to go and feed, and on\r\nreturning will know exactly where to find her kid.\r\n\r\nMany owners allow the does which have kidded to herd themselves, as they\r\nusually return to their kids, often coming in several times during the\r\nday. Of course this necessitates having plenty of food and water within\r\naccess of the staking ground. The wet band could be herded as in the\r\ncorral method.\r\n\r\nIn this staking method if a mother refuses to own her kid, or if she\r\ndies, the kid has no chance to steal milk from some other wet doe, and\r\nunless closely watched, quite a number of kids will starve. The rope\r\nshould be changed from one leg to the other occasionally to allow\r\nsymmetry of development. The preparation of ropes and stakes for a\r\nthousand kids is quite a task, and it keeps the energetic herder busy\r\nduring his spare moments getting ready for kidding time.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days the Angora kid is full of life and vigor as any\r\nanimal of like age. If he be well nourished, he will frisk and play at\r\nall kinds of antics, until he is so tired that he must forget\r\neverything. The sleep which comes is so sound that any usual amount of\r\nnoise does not disturb him. It is this characteristic which makes it\r\nunsafe to take kids on to the range with a flock. The kids are liable to\r\nhide behind some bush, go to sleep and be lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTRATING.\r\n\r\nBefore the kids are allowed to go out with the flock the males should be\r\ncastrated. The Turk does not alter the males until they have developed\r\nsexuality and the male horn, _i. e._, the heavy characteristic buck\r\nhorn. He then castrates by either removing the testicles, or by twisting\r\nor destroying the spermatic cord. When the latter method is used the\r\ntesticles and cord undergo an inflammatory process which destroys the\r\nregenerative power of the animal. The testicles remain in the scrotum\r\napparently unchanged. The animal thus treated presents to the casual\r\nobserver the physical characteristics of a buck. The Turk claims that an\r\nanimal treated in this manner is less liable to die than one whose\r\ntesticles are removed. This is probably true, as the initial lesion\r\nproduced by the operation is very small, and there is less liability of\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nThe usual method employed in this country is to remove the testicles\r\nbefore the regenerative power of the animal is developed. This gives the\r\nwether a feminine appearance, and there is comparatively little danger\r\nof death if the operation is properly performed. It will be easiest to\r\ncastrate the kids between the age of two and four weeks. The kids\r\nshould be driven into a small clean corral, and after undergoing the\r\noperation they should be turned into a large clean enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe operator stands on the outside of the small corral, and the\r\nassistant catches the kids and turns them belly up before the operator,\r\nonto a board which has been fastened to the fence. A pair of clean\r\nscissors, or a sharp knife, which may be kept in a five per cent.\r\ncarbolic acid solution when not in use, serve to cut off the distal end\r\nof the scrotum. The testicles are then seized with the fingers and drawn\r\nout. The operator drops the castrated kid into the large enclosure and\r\nthe assistant presents another kid. Two men can operate on sixty kids an\r\nhour. The testicles are slippery and some herders prefer to use the\r\nteeth instead of the fingers to extract the testicles. Under no\r\ncircumstances should any unclean thing be put into the scrotum. Death\r\nusually results from infection, and infection from uncleanliness. A\r\nlittle boracic acid might be sprinkled over the cut surface as an\r\nadditional precaution, but this is unnecessary if ordinary cleanliness\r\nis observed. If after a few days the kid's scrotum swells, and does not\r\ndischarge, the scrotum should be opened with a clean instrument. Less\r\nthan one-half of one per cent. of the kids will die from this\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n\r\nRIDGLINGS.\r\n\r\nWhile castrating the kids the operator will discover that some of the\r\nkids have but one descended testicle. When these animals are found the\r\ndescended testicle should be removed, and they should be recognized by\r\nsome distinctive ear mark or brand. These animals will develop like\r\nbucks. It is a disputed question as to whether they are able to exercise\r\nregenerative power, but they will cover the does, and in some cases they\r\nprobably get kids. The undescended testicle can be removed, but as the\r\ntesticle usually lies close to the kidney, and is hard to distinguish\r\nfrom that organ in the young animal, it is best to delay the operation\r\nuntil the ridgling is at least six months old. The instruments necessary\r\nfor this operation are a stout rope to suspend the animal, a clean sharp\r\nknife, scissors to remove the mohair from the place to be incised, and\r\nsharp needles threaded with silk. The knife, scissors and silk should be\r\nimmersed in a hot 5% carbolic acid solution, and they should be kept in\r\nthis solution except when actually in use.\r\n\r\nThe rope is fastened to the hind legs of the animal and he is suspended\r\nin midair. An assistant steadies the body of the goat. The operator\r\nselects a place on the loin of the goat, about two or three inches away\r\nfrom the backbone, below the ribs and above the hip bone, on the side\r\nopposite to that which the descended testicle occupied. He then shears\r\nthe mohair from this part of the goat. The mohair should be removed\r\nfrom a space at least eight inches square. A lengthwise incision is then\r\nmade through the skin and muscles, or after the skin is cut, the muscles\r\ncan be separated with the fingers and the testicle is found. It usually\r\nlies close to the backbone, to the lower and inner side of the kidney.\r\nIt is usually undeveloped and much smaller than the kidney. Its surface\r\nis smooth and not indented like the kidney. When it is discovered it can\r\nbe withdrawn through the opening, and adherent tissue clipped with the\r\nscissors. The muscles and skin should be brought together with the silk\r\nthread. The needles should pierce the muscles as well as the skin, and\r\nthe edges of the skin should approximate. No hair should be allowed to\r\nremain between the cut surfaces, as the wound will not heal rapidly.\r\nAfter the wound is closed some boracic acid powder may be dusted over\r\nthe wound, and the goat allowed his freedom. After ten days or two weeks\r\nthe silk threads should be cut and drawn out, as they will not absorb,\r\nand they will irritate the wound. If this operation is carefully\r\nperformed, and strict cleanliness adhered to, less than 2% of the\r\nanimals operated upon will die.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH.\r\n\r\nA kid at birth is usually small and weak, possibly weighing from four to\r\nsix pounds. For the first few days of life he grows slowly, but as the\r\norgans adapt themselves to the new life, the kid becomes strong and\r\ngrows rapidly. When the kid is born he is covered with a coarse hair,\r\nand it is not until he is from three to five weeks old that the fine\r\nmohair fibers appear growing between the coarser hairs. The kid\r\ncontinues to grow gradually, and at three or four months he weighs from\r\ntwenty to forty pounds. The mohair may now be from two to four inches\r\nlong. At a year old the Angora goat will weigh from fifty to eighty\r\npounds, and the mohair may be as long as twelve inches, or sometimes\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEANING.\r\n\r\nWhen does are bred once a year the kid should be weaned before the doe\r\nis rebred. This allows the doe time to recuperate before her maternal\r\npowers are again brought into active service. Then, too, a doe nursing a\r\nkid through the winter, enters the spring with a depleted system and\r\nproduces a poor quality and small quantity of mohair. The kids should be\r\nweaned when they are about five months old, as this allows the mother at\r\nleast two months rest before she is rebred.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKING.\r\n\r\nThere are various reasons for marking goats, and the methods employed\r\nvary as widely as the reasons therefor. The object in view is to put\r\nsome mark of identification either permanent or temporary upon the\r\nanimal. The ears may be cropped in certain ways, a brand may be placed\r\nupon the nose, or tags or buttons placed in the ears, or characters\r\ntattooed into the ears. Probably the most permanent mark is the tattoo,\r\nand if it be placed on the inner hairless surface of the ear, it is as\r\nlasting as the tattoo so often seen in a man's arm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome of the older breeders supposed that the Angora was not subject to\r\nany disease, but as goats have been introduced into new territory, they\r\nhave become affected by some of the same troubles which bother sheep,\r\nbut usually to a less degree. Some of the worst sheep diseases, such as\r\nscab, do not bother goats, but the goat has some special complaints\r\nwhich do not affect sheep. Very few carcasses are condemned by the\r\ngovernment meat inspectors at the large packing centers. Tuberculosis is\r\nalmost unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICE.\r\n\r\nNearly all goats are infested with lice, a small reddish louse, a goat\r\nlouse. Lice rarely kills the animal infested, but they do annoy the goat\r\ngreatly. Goats will not fatten readily, and the mohair is usually dead\r\n(lusterless), if the animals are badly infested. It is an easy matter to\r\ndiscover the lice. The goats scratch their bodies with their horns and\r\nmake the fleece appear a little ragged. On separating the mohair the\r\nlice can easily be seen with the naked eye. The best means of ridding\r\nthe goats of this annoyance is with almost any of the sheep dips. A dip\r\nwhich does not stain the mohair should be selected. The goats should be\r\ndipped after shearing, as it does not take much dip then to penetrate to\r\nthe skin. One dipping will usually kill the lice, but the albuminous\r\ncoat covering the nits (eggs of the louse), are not easily penetrated,\r\nand it is usually necessary to dip again within ten days, so that the\r\nnits, which have hatched since the first dipping, will not have a chance\r\nto mature and deposit more eggs. Goats can be dipped at almost any time,\r\nbut if in full fleece they will require a larger quantity of liquid, and\r\nif the weather is very cold, there is some danger.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOMACH WORMS.\r\n\r\nStomach worms affect goats, and in some instances their ravages prove\r\nfatal. There are a variety of these worms, but the general effect on the\r\nanimal is about the same. They are usually worse in wet years. The goats\r\naffected become thin and weak. They usually scour. Sometimes the worm,\r\nor part of the worm, can be found in the feces. These same symptoms are\r\ncaused by starvation, so the two should not be confounded. There are\r\nmany drenches in use for the treatment of this trouble, and some of the\r\nproprietary remedies have given some relief. Goats running on dry, high\r\nland are rarely affected.\r\n\r\nVerminous pneumonia of sheep may also occur in goats.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOT ROT.\r\n\r\nFoot rot is a disease which affects both goats and sheep, if they are\r\nkept on low wet land. It rarely proves fatal, and can be cured if the\r\ncause is removed, but it sometimes causes a good deal of trouble. The\r\ngoats' feet swell between the toes and become so sore that the animals\r\nare compelled to walk on their knees. It can be cured by carefully\r\ntrimming the feet and using solutions of blue stone. Goats should not be\r\nput on wet land.\r\n\r\nSometimes the glands of the neck enlarge, a condition known as goitre.\r\nThis is sometimes fatal with kids, but usually cures itself. There is no\r\nknown remedy for it, but it is comparatively rare.\r\n\r\nAnthrax, tuberculosis, pleuro-pneumonia and meningitis, will affect\r\ngoats, but these diseases are very rare. Some of the southern goats have\r\nswollen ears, but what the cause of this trouble is no one has yet\r\ndetermined.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOISONS.\r\n\r\nThere are several plants which will poison goats, but very little is\r\nknown about them. Some of the laurel family are responsible for the\r\ndeath of a good many goats yearly, and some milk-weeds will kill if\r\ntaken in sufficient amount at certain times of the year. These plants\r\nshould be avoided as much as possible. Treatment has been rather\r\nunsatisfactory. If the poisoned animal is treated at once, an active\r\npurgative may rid the system of the irritant. Epsom salts and crotin oil\r\nhave given relief.\r\n\r\nMr. Schreiner describes an epidemic of pleuro-pneumonia which destroyed\r\nmany flocks of Angora goats in South Africa. The disease was effectually\r\nstamped out in that country, and it has never appeared in American\r\nflocks. Mr. Thompson has described a disease called Takosis, which was\r\nsupposed to have caused the death of many goats in the Eastern States,\r\nand along the Missouri River Valley. Some claimed that this trouble was\r\ncaused by change of climate, others thought that it was starvation or\r\nlack of proper care. There is very little evidence of it now in the\r\nUnited States. All in all, the Angora goat is the healthiest of domestic\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Own Flocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1865, Mr. C. P. Bailey started in the Angora goat industry. There\r\nwere then very few Angora goats in the United States, and those in\r\nCalifornia had originated from two thoroughbred bucks secured from Col.\r\nPeters of Atlanta, Georgia.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Mr. Bailey secured a pair of Angoras from W. W. Chenery of\r\nBoston, Mass. There were two other pairs secured at this time for other\r\nparties, and these three does were the _first thoroughbred does_ brought\r\nto California. The first two goats cost Mr. Bailey $1000. _The first\r\nthoroughbred Angora kid_ dropped in California was by Mr. Bailey's doe.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, Mr. Bailey furnished money to bring the Brown & Diehl\r\nimportation to California, with the understanding that he was to have\r\nfirst choice. The Angoras secured from this lot were _the best goats_\r\nwhich had been brought to California up to that time.\r\n\r\nIn 1876, Mr. Bailey selected the best buck of the Hall & Harris\r\nimportation, and paid seventy-five dollars service fee for three of his\r\nBrown & Diehl does. Later he purchased forty-one head from Hall &\r\nHarris. Some of these were the Brown & Diehl goats, and some from the\r\nHall & Harris importation of 1876.\r\n\r\nTwelve years after Mr. Bailey commenced breeding Angoras, he moved his\r\nentire grade-flock, consisting of about 1000 animals, to Nevada, and\r\nmaintained his thoroughbred flocks in California. By careful selection,\r\nrigid culling, and strict attention given his flocks, Mr. Bailey had\r\nbrought them by 1892, to an excellence beyond any of the imported stock.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, Mr. Bailey imported two fine bucks from South Africa. An\r\naccount of the buck Pasha will be found in this book.\r\n\r\nIn 1899, another direct importation from South Africa was made, and the\r\ngreat sire Capetown was secured.\r\n\r\nIn 1901, Dr. W. C. Bailey secured four of the best Angoras obtainable in\r\nAsia Minor, by personal selection, and added them to the Bailey flocks.\r\nThis was the first importation made in America from Asia Minor for\r\ntwenty-five years.\r\n\r\nDuring all these years, since 1865, Mr. Bailey had been constantly at\r\nwork with his Angora flocks. There were many hardships to overcome, and\r\nmost of the original Angora breeders gave up the struggle. We honestly\r\nbelieve that if it had not been for his perseverance the Angora industry\r\nwould not be in its present prosperous condition.\r\n\r\n\r\nRegister.\r\n\r\nWe have been keeping a register of our stock, and this register is the\r\noldest in the United States, or the world. Animals registered in the\r\nBailey Angora Goat Record have a universal standing.\r\n\r\n\r\nManufacturers of Gloves, Robes and Trimmings.\r\n\r\nThe Angora Robe and Glove Company was established in 1875, with C. P.\r\nBailey as president. Later Mr. Bailey secured sole control of this\r\ncompany. We have been using goat skins and mohair in large quantities\r\nfor the last thirty years, and to-day\r\n\r\nWE PAY THE HIGHEST CASH PRICES FOR GOAT SKINS AND MOHAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nBuck Selections.\r\n\r\nFrom the above history it will be seen that we have several different\r\nstrains of bucks to offer, and the fact that we have taken the Grand\r\nPrizes and highest awards at the New Orleans World's Fair, 1885, Chicago\r\nWorld's Fair, 1893, St. Louis World's Fair, 1904, and sweep stakes at\r\nState Fairs and National Meetings for the last thirty years, should put\r\nthese bucks on the top. We have sold thousands in United States, and\r\nthey have given almost universal satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes.\r\n\r\nOur thoroughbred does trace their ancestry to the best stock obtainable.\r\nWe always have a good many grade Angora does on the range, and we are\r\nprepared to quote prices on carloads, or small lots. We gladly furnish\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n    C. P. BAILEY & SONS CO.,\r\n    San Jose, California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERSIAN FAT TAIL SHEEP\r\n\r\nIn 1892, we received the first importation of Persian Fat-Tailed Sheep.\r\nThey are very hardy, rapid growers (the lambs often gaining a pound a\r\nday for the first one hundred days,) good rangers almost free from\r\ndisease, and to cross onto fine wooled sheep for mutton and wool, we\r\nconsider them of much value.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's Practical Angora Goat Raising, by C.
