The first account of them\r\nwhich we can find, is in the fifth volume of Jones’s Philosophical\r\nTransactions abridged, part second, page 159, in an extract of a letter\r\nfrom Dr. Mather to Dr. Woodward, dated Boston, Nov. 17, 1712; in which\r\nthe Doctor gives an account of a large work in manuscript, intitled the\r\n_Biblia Americana_. _This work Dr. Mather recommends to the patronage of\r\nsome Mecænas, to promote the publication of. As a specimen of it he\r\ntranscribes a passage out of it, being a note on that passage in\r\nGenesis, chap. _vi._ verse _4_, relating to giants; and confirms the\r\nopinion of there having been in the antediluvian world men of a very\r\nlarge and prodigious stature, by the bones and teeth of some large\r\nanimals found lately in Albany in New England, which, for some reasons,\r\nhe thinks to be human; particularly a tooth brought from the place where\r\nit was found to New York in _1705_, being a very large grinder, weighing\r\nfour pounds and three quarters; with a bone supposed to be a thigh-bone,\r\nseventeen feet long. He also mentions another tooth, broad and flat like\r\na fore-tooth, four fingers broad; the bones crumble to pieces in the air\r\nafter they are dug up; they were found near a place called _Cluverack_,\r\nabout thirty miles on this side Albany. He then gives the description of\r\none which he resembles to the eye-tooth of a man: He says it has four\r\nprongs or roots, flat and something worn on the top; it was six inches\r\nhigh, wanting one-eighth as it stood upright on the root, and almost\r\nthirteen inches in circumference; it weighed two pounds four ounces Troy\r\nweight. There was another near a pound heavier, found under the bank of\r\nHudson’s River, about fifty leagues from the sea, a great way beneath\r\nthe surface of the earth, where the ground is of a different colour and\r\nsubstance from the other ground, for seventy-five feet long, which they\r\nsuppose to be from the rotting of the body, to which these bones and\r\nteeth did, as he supposes, once belong. It were to be wished he had\r\ngiven an exact figure of these bones and teeth._\r\n\r\nThis account is only worth preserving, as it fixes the time at which\r\nthese extraordinary remains of antiquity were first discovered in\r\nAmerica, previous to their being found in Siberia. The supposition that\r\nthey were the bones of a giant was scarcely less probable than that they\r\nshould have belonged to a quadruped of which not the smallest vestige\r\ncould be traced.—Prepossessed, therefore, with the certainty of their\r\nbeing human bones, a calculation was made of the height of the supposed\r\ngiant, very probably from a broken piece of thigh-bone, and a length of\r\nseventeen feet was calculated in proportion to the thickness of that\r\nwhich was subject to their examination; for take either half of these\r\nthigh-bones, and nothing can more resemble that of the human leg, until\r\nthe whole is seen together, when, from its thickness, it is evidently\r\nthat of a quadruped, the human thigh being very long and slender. The\r\nseventy-five feet of black earth, which they calculated to be the length\r\nof a man whose thigh-bone was supposed seventeen feet, could have been\r\nnothing but a small morass divested of its water; and hence the decayed\r\nstate of the bones.\r\n\r\nIt appears that about the year 1740, great numbers of bones, of a\r\nsimilar kind, were found in Kentucky on the Ohio; but they were\r\ncollected with such eagerness, and forwarded to Europe so hastily, that\r\nit shortly became impossible to distinguish one set of bones from\r\nanother, so as to ascertain their number, proportion, and kind; parts of\r\nthe same animal having been scattered over England, France, and Germany,\r\nand there compared with similar ones from Siberia. Buffon[1] speaking of\r\none of these thigh-bones brought from the Ohio by the way of Canada,\r\nwhich he describes as being the tenth of an inch shorter than one from\r\nSiberia, and yet an inch thicker, says; “This disproportion is so great\r\nas hitherto to deceive me with respect to this bone, though it otherwise\r\nresembles, both in the external figure and internal structure, the femur\r\nof the elephant (he should have said, the femur found in Siberia),\r\nmentioned under the number DCDLXXXVII. The difference in thickness,\r\nwhich appeared excessive, seemed sufficient to attribute this bone to\r\nanother animal which must have been larger than the elephant; but as no\r\nsuch animal is known, recourse must be had to the pretended MAMMOTH, a\r\nfabulous animal supposed to inhabit the regions of the north, where are\r\nfrequently found bones, teeth, and tusks of the elephant.” Here again\r\nthe word elephant is improperly introduced; Messrs. Buffon and Daubenton\r\nhaving conceived an idea that all the Siberian and some of the American\r\nbones belonged unquestionably to elephants, render their observations\r\nalmost unintelligible, from the confident use of the term elephant in\r\ncases where it was at least doubtful, especially as it is now evident,\r\nthat the same animal was native in the north of both countries; with one\r\nprobable difference, that the bones of the American animal are\r\ncomparatively thicker than the Siberian; and with this striking\r\ndifference between them both and the elephant, that the thigh-bones of\r\nthe latter are round as well as slender, whereas those of the Mammoth\r\nare much flattened, so as to stand obliquely in the animal. After\r\nreciting the account given by Mr. Fabry, who states the place and manner\r\nin which Mr. le Baron de Longueuil, Mr. de Bienville, and Mr. de Lignery\r\n(lieutenant in Canada), found some of these bones and teeth on the Ohio\r\nin 1740, he proceeds; “Mr. du Hamel, of the Royal Academy of Sciences,\r\ninforms us that Mr. de Longueuil had likewise brought, in 1740, some\r\nvery large grinders found in Canada, and perhaps with the tusk and femur\r\nwhich I shall mention. These teeth have no characters in common with\r\nthose of the elephant, but greatly resemble the teeth of the\r\nhippopotamus, so that there is reason to believe they may be part of\r\nthat animal; for it can never be supposed that these teeth could have\r\nbeen taken from the same head with the tusks, or that it could have made\r\npart of the same skeleton with the femur above-mentioned: In supposing\r\nthis, it would be necessary to suppose an UNKNOWN ANIMAL, which had\r\ntusks similar to those of the elephant, and grinders resembling those of\r\nthe hippopotamus. (_Voyez les Memoires de l’Academie Royale des\r\nSciences, Année 1762_).”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Vol. XI. Page 169, No. MXXXV. Autre Femur d’Elephante.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHere M. de Buffon, however unwillingly, has drawn a true picture of the\r\nMammoth, with some little variation, inasmuch as the tusks do resemble\r\nthose of the elephant, except in having a greater curve and spiral\r\ntwist, and as the teeth do resemble those of the hippopotamus, except\r\nthat in the latter there are never more than three prongs, or\r\nblunt-pointed protuberances, on the grinding surface; whereas in this\r\nanimal the large teeth have five and six, and the small teeth three and\r\nfour prongs, very differently arranged from those of the former.\r\n\r\nThe elephant, which is a graminivorous animal, is armed with tusks, more\r\nproperly called by the French _defences_; but to me it appears nothing\r\ninconsistent with the nature of a carnivorous animal that it should be\r\nfurnished with a similar weapon of offence and defence, and indeed from\r\ntheir form somewhat better calculated to answer those objects; therefore\r\nthe number of instances in which these tusks and those carnivorous teeth\r\nwere found with bones resembling the bones of the elephant, though\r\nlarger, should have been taken as the strongest presumption that they\r\nwere the fragments of one animal, which, from its fossil remains\r\n(accompanied with the most terrific and fabulous accounts), has been\r\ndistinguished, both in Russia and America, by the name of MAMMOTH.\r\n\r\nMr. Collinson, Member of the Royal Society, in a letter on this subject\r\nto M. Buffon[2], after describing the situation of the salt lick on the\r\nOhio, where an amazing number of bones of the elephant, as he imagined\r\nthem to be, were found, together with teeth totally unlike those of the\r\nelephant, concludes thus: “But the large teeth which I send you, Sir,\r\nwere found with those tusks or defences; others yet larger than these\r\nshew, nay demonstrate, that they did not belong to elephants. How shall\r\nwe reconcile this paradox? May we not suppose that there existed\r\nformerly a large animal with the tusks of the elephant and the grinders\r\nof the hippopotamus? For these large grinders are very different from\r\nthose of the elephant. Mr. Croghan thinks, from the great number of this\r\nkind of teeth, that is, the tusks and grinders which he saw in that\r\nplace, that there had been at least thirty of these animals; yet the\r\nelephant never was known in America, and probably could not have been\r\ncarried there from Asia: the impossibility that they could have lived\r\nthere, owing to the severity of the winters, and where, notwithstanding\r\nsuch a quantity of their bones is found, is a paradox which we leave to\r\nyour eminent wisdom to solve.” This determination M. Buffon gives us in\r\nthe following terms, although in direct contradiction to those passages\r\nin which he labours to prove that the bones found in Siberia and America\r\nwere bones of the elephant: “Thus every thing leads us to believe that\r\nthis ancient species, which must be regarded as the first and largest of\r\nterrestrial animals, has not existed since the earliest times, and is\r\ntotally unknown to us; for an animal whose species was larger than that\r\nof the elephant, could hide itself in no part of the earth so as to\r\nremain unknown; besides, it is evident from the form of these teeth\r\nalone, from their enamel and the disposition of their roots, that they\r\nbear no resemblance to the _cachelots_, or other cetaceous animals, and\r\nthat they really belonged to a terrestrial animal whose species\r\napproached that of the hippopotamus more than any other.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Buffon, Tome XIII. Notes justificative, Page 224.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world is now in possession of two undisputed skeletons of this\r\nanimal, found in such situations as leave no room for conjecture; each\r\nskeleton being dug up in a separate place, without any intermixture of\r\nforeign bones, and each bone exactly adapted to its corresponding points\r\nof articulation. One of these skeletons is erected as a permanent\r\nestablishment at the Museum, Philadelphia; the other I have brought with\r\nme, with an intention to travel through Europe, beginning with the\r\nmetropolis of England.\r\n\r\nI shall here give a short account of the place and manner of finding\r\nthese.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1801, having heard that in the fall of 1799 many bones\r\nof this animal had been found in the state of New York, in the vicinity\r\nof Newburgh, which is situated on the Hudson or North River, about\r\nsixty-seven miles from the capital, my father, C. W. Peale, immediately\r\nproceeded to the spot, and through the politeness of Dr. Graham, who\r\nlived in the neighbourhood, and had been present when most of the bones\r\nwere dug up, received every information with respect to what had been\r\ndone, and the most probable means of future success. The bones that had\r\nbeen found were then in the possession of the farmer who owned the land,\r\nheaped together on the floor of his garret, where they were occasionally\r\nvisited by the curious.\r\n\r\nThese my father was fortunate to make a purchase of, together with the\r\nright of digging up the remainder; and immediately packing them up, sent\r\nthem on to Philadelphia: They consisted of all the neck, most of the\r\nvertebræ of the back, and some of the tail; most of the ribs, in greater\r\npart broken; both scapulæ; both humeri, with the radii and ulnæ; one\r\nfemur; a tibia of one leg, and a fibula of the other; some large\r\nfragments of the head; many of the fore and hind feet bones; the pelvis\r\nsomewhat broken; and a large fragment, five feet long, of the left tusk,\r\nabout mid way. He therefore was in want of some of the back and tail\r\nbones, some of the ribs, the under jaw, one whole tusk and part of the\r\nother, the breast-bone, one thigh, and a tibia and fibula, and many of\r\nthe feet bones. But as the farmer’s fields were then in grain, the\r\nenterprize of searching for the remainder was postponed for a short\r\ntime. Two or three weeks were spent in mending such bones as were\r\nbroken, and arranging the whole; but the deficiencies were such, that\r\nvery few of them could be put together.\r\n\r\nNot willing to lose the advantage of the dry season, when the springs in\r\nthe morass of course were low, we proceeded on the arduous enterprize.\r\nIn New York every article was provided which might be necessary in\r\nsurmounting expected difficulties; such as a pump, ropes, pullies,\r\naugers, &c.; boards and plank were provided in the neighbourhood, and\r\ntimber was in sufficient plenty on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe whole of this part of the country abounding with morasses, it is the\r\ncustom of the farmers to assist each other in turns with personal or\r\nspecific labour, each man giving a route or frolick on the occasion, in\r\norder to obtain a large quantity of their contents for manure. Pits are\r\ndug generally twelve feet long and five feet wide. It was in digging one\r\nof these, on the farm of Mr. Masten, that one of the men, in thrusting\r\nhis spade deeper than usual, struck something which he imagined to be a\r\nlog of wood, but on cutting it to ascertain the kind, it was perceived\r\nto be bone: it was quickly cleared from the surrounding earth, and\r\nproved to be that of the thigh, three feet nine inches in length, and\r\neighteen inches in circumference in the smallest part. The search was\r\ncontinued, and the same evening several other bones were discovered. The\r\nfame of it soon spread through the neighbourhood, and excited a general\r\ninterest in the pursuit; and all were eager, at the expence of some\r\nexertions, to gratify their curiosity, to see the ruins of an animal so\r\ngigantic, of which few among them had ever heard. For the two succeeding\r\ndays upwards of an hundred men were actively engaged, encouraged by\r\nseveral gentlemen, chiefly physicians, of the neighbourhood, and success\r\nthe most sanguine attended their labours; but unfortunately the habits\r\nof the men requiring the use of spirits, it was afforded them in too\r\ngreat profusion, and they quickly became so impatient and unruly that\r\nthey had nearly destroyed the skeleton; in one or two instances using\r\noxen and chains to drag them from the clay, the head, hips, and tusk,\r\nwere much broken; some parts being drawn out and others left behind. So\r\ngreat a quantity of water, from springs in the bottom of the pit, rose\r\nupon the men, that it required several score of hands to lade it out\r\nwith all the buckets they could collect in the neighbourhood. All their\r\ningenuity was exerted to overcome difficulties that every hour increased\r\nupon their hands; they even made and sunk a large coffer-dam, and within\r\nit found many valuable small bones. The fourth day so much water had\r\nrisen in the pit, that they had not courage to attack it again. In this\r\nstate we found it in 1801.\r\n\r\nConfident that nothing could be done without having a perfect command of\r\nthe water, the first idea was to drain it by a ditch; but the necessary\r\ndistance of perhaps half a mile, presented a length of labour that\r\nappeared immense. It was therefore resolved to throw the water into a\r\nnatural bason about sixty feet distant, the upper edge of which was\r\nabout ten feet above the level of the water. An ingenious millwright\r\nconstructed the machinery; and after a week of close labour, completed a\r\nlarge scaffolding and a wheel twenty feet diameter, wide enough for\r\nthree or four men to walk abreast in: a rope round this turned a small\r\nspindle, which worked a chain of buckets regulated by a floating\r\ncylinder; the water emptied into a trough which conveyed it to the\r\nbason; a ship’s pump assisted, and towards the latter part of the\r\noperation, a pair of half barrels in removing the mud. The second day\r\nthe water was lowered so that they began to dig, and in a few hours were\r\nrewarded with several small bones.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer with his wife and children, for twenty miles round in every\r\ndirection, with waggons, carriages, and horses, flocked to see the\r\noperation; and a swamp always noted for being the solitary and dismal\r\nabode of snakes and frogs, became the active scene of curiosity and\r\nbustle; the greater part astonished at the whim of an old man in\r\ntravelling two hundred miles from his home, to dig up as a treasure, at\r\nincredible risk, labour, and expence, a pile of bones, which, although\r\nall were astonished to see, many imagined fit for nothing better than to\r\nrot and serve for manure.\r\n\r\nFor several weeks no exertions were spared, and those the most\r\nunremitting were required to insure success; bank after bank fell in;\r\nthe increase of water was a constant impediment, the extreme coldness of\r\nwhich benumbed the workmen: Every day bones and pieces of bones were\r\nfound between six and seven feet deep, but none of the most important\r\nones. But the greatest obstacle to the search was occasioned by the\r\nshell marle which formed the lower stratum; this, rendered thin by the\r\nsprings at the bottom, and by the weight of the whole morass, always\r\npressed upwards on the workmen to a certain height; which, without an\r\nincalculable expence, it was impossible to prevent. Twenty-five hands,\r\nat high wages, were almost constantly employed at work so uncomfortable\r\nand severe, that nothing but their anxiety to see the head, and\r\nparticularly the under jaw, could have kept up their resolution. The\r\npatience of employer and workmen was at length exhausted, and the work\r\nrelinquished without obtaining those interesting parts without which it\r\nwas impossible to form a skeleton.\r\n\r\nThrough the polite attention of Dr. Galatian, the next place we directed\r\nour attention to was a morass, eleven miles distant from the former,\r\nbelonging to a Captain Joseph Barber, where, eight years before, four\r\nribs had been found in digging a pit. From the description which was\r\ngiven of their position, and the appearance of the morass, which was a\r\nsmall one, we began our operations with all the vigour a certainty of\r\nsuccess could inspire. Almost an entire set of ribs were found, lying\r\npretty much together, and very entire; but as none of the back-bones\r\nwere found near them, sufficient proof of their having been scattered,\r\nour latitude for search was extended without limits; therefore, after\r\nworking about two weeks, we found nothing belonging to the head but two\r\nrotten tusks (part of one of them is with the skeleton here), three or\r\nfour small grinders, a few vertebræ of the back and tail, a broken\r\nscapula, some toe-bones and the ribs; these were found between four and\r\nseven feet deep.\r\n\r\nOur next place of search (about twenty miles west from the Hudson) was a\r\nmost dismal morass; the most awful silence reigned throughout it, and\r\nnot the smallest breath of air was felt; every step was taken on rotten\r\ntimber and the spreading roots of tall trees, the luxuriant growth of a\r\nfew years, half of which were tottering over our heads. It was almost a\r\ndead level, and the holes dug for the purpose of manure, out of which a\r\nfew bones had been taken six or seven years before, were full of water,\r\nand connected with others containing a vast quantity: so that to empty\r\none was to empty them all. Machinery was erected, pumps and buckets were\r\nemployed, and a long course of troughs conducted the water, among the\r\ndistant roots, to a fall of a few inches.\r\n\r\nHere alternate success and disappointment amused and fatigued us for a\r\nlong while; until our pockets emptied, our spirits low, our workmen\r\nlanguid, we were about to quit the morass with but a small collection,\r\nthough in good preservation, of ribs, toe and leg bones, &c. In the\r\nmeanwhile the ground was searched in various directions with\r\nlong-pointed rods and cross handles: after some practice we were able to\r\ndistinguish by the feel whatever substances we touched harder than the\r\nsoil; and by this means, in a very unexpected direction, struck upon a\r\nlarge collection of bones, which were dug to and taken up with every\r\npossible care. They proved to be a humerus, or large bone of the right\r\nleg, with the radius and ulna of the left, the right scapula, the atlas,\r\nand, the great object of our pursuit, a complete under jaw!\r\n\r\nAfter such a variety of labour and length of fruitless expectation, this\r\nsuccess was extremely grateful to all parties, and the woods echoed with\r\nrepeated huzzas. “Gracious God, what a jaw! how many animals have been\r\ncrushed between it!” was the exclamation of all; a fresh supply of grog\r\nwent round, and the hearty fellows, covered with mud, continued the\r\nsearch. The upper part of the head was found twelve feet distant, but so\r\nextremely rotten that we could only preserve the teeth and a few\r\nfragments. In its form it exactly resembled the head found at Masten’s,\r\nbut as that was much injured by rough usage, this from its small depth\r\nbeneath the surface, had the cranium so rotted away as only to shew the\r\nform around the teeth and thence extending to the condyles of the neck;\r\nthe rotten bone formed a black and greasy mould above that part which\r\nwas still entire, yet so tender as to break to pieces on lifting it from\r\nits bed.\r\n\r\nThis collection was rendered still more complete by the addition of\r\nthose formerly taken up, and presented to us by Drs. Graham and Post.\r\nThey were a rib, the sternum, a femur, tibia and fibula, and a patella\r\nor knee-pan.\r\n\r\nSome of the neighbours, with an eye to the certain prospect of profit,\r\nbegan to think of finding a similar treasure in their morasses; and one\r\nactually began his operations, but was quickly deterred by the rising\r\ndifficulties, although he had some reason to hope for success, eighteen\r\nyears before, several bones having been discovered in the same spot, and\r\nby a German physician forwarded to England. We examined the place, and\r\nwere of opinion, as the morass had been since drained, that the\r\nremaining bones must necessarily have decayed in consequence of their\r\nexposure to the air, alternately wet and dry.\r\n\r\nWe visited every spot in the neighbourhood where any bones had ever been\r\nfound, and we knew of seven within ten miles square; but there appeared\r\nno prospect of success adequate to the expence and difficulty: So that,\r\nafter a laborious campaign of three months, we carefully packed up, in\r\ndistinct cases, our venerable relics, and loading two waggons with them,\r\nbade adieu to the vallies and mountains of Shawangunk.\r\n\r\nAfter the laborious task of mending the ribs and other bones, and\r\nputting together the fragments of the head (of which no other idea could\r\nbe formed than appears in the skeleton), it remained to determine the\r\nnumber and situation of each kind. The three setts were kept distinct;\r\nout of the two collections which were most numerous it was intended to\r\nform two skeletons, by still keeping them separate, and filling up the\r\ndeficiencies in each by artificial imitations from the other, and from\r\ncounterparts in themselves. For instance, in the first skeleton the\r\nunder jaw was formed from this, which is the only entire one we have\r\never heard of, although we have seen considerable fragments of at least\r\nten different jaws; while on the other hand, the upper jaw of this\r\nanimal, which was found in the extreme of decay, was completed, so far\r\nas it goes, from the more solid fragment in the former skeleton. Several\r\nfeet-bones in this skeleton were made from that; and a few in that were\r\nmade from this. In this the right humerus being real, the imitation for\r\nthe left one was made with the utmost certainty; and the radius and ulna\r\nof the left leg being real, those on the right side followed in course.\r\nThe collection of ribs in both cases was pretty entire; therefore,\r\nhaving discovered from a correspondence between the number of vertebræ\r\nand ribs in both animals, that there were nineteen pair of the latter,\r\nit was only necessary in four or five instances where there was not a\r\ncomplete pair, either to make an artificial counterpart, or to take the\r\nsame formed rib from the collection found at Captain Barber’s. In this\r\nmanner the two skeletons were formed, and are in both instances composed\r\nof the appropriate bones of the animal, or exact imitations from the\r\nreal bones in the same animal, or from those of the same proportion in\r\nthe other: Nothing is imaginary, and what we do not unquestionably know,\r\nwe leave deficient; which happens in only two instances, the summit of\r\nthe head and the end of the tail.\r\n\r\nThe tusk which belongs to the skeleton at Philadelphia, I have brought\r\nwith me: in taking it from the ground it was broken into three pieces,\r\nbut they were carefully put together, and give the entire form, composed\r\nof a strong arch and a spiral twist resembling an ox’s horn, ten feet\r\nsix inches in length and twenty-one inches in circumference. In the\r\nLeverian Museum there is a fossil elephant’s tusk found in England,\r\nabout seven feet in length: On making a comparison between these it will\r\nbe observed, that in the Leverian tusk there is not the smallest twist,\r\nand but a gentle curve; whereas in this animal they are much more\r\ncrooked in every respect; the consequence of which is, that as the\r\ncavities for the reception of the tusks lie more horizontal (from a\r\nsimilar direction between the teeth and the condyle of the neck), the\r\ntusks are much more elevated, and the ends pointing backwards. It is the\r\nopinion of many, that these tusks might have been reversed in the living\r\nanimal, with their points downwards; but as we know not the kind of\r\nenemy it had to fear, we judged only by analogy in giving them the\r\ndirection of the elephant, especially as we know of no other carnivorous\r\nanimal with only eight grinders and two tusks: Neither the tusk itself,\r\nnor the cavities for the reception of them, could assist in the\r\ndetermination, as they were both very straight, and would equally answer\r\none way as the other.\r\n\r\nThere is one bone less in the neck of this animal than in the elephant;\r\nand we are confident of having the whole, for two reasons; _1st_, The\r\nneck-bones were found with the first skeleton all together, in their\r\nnatural positions, and the first bone of the back, with which the sixth\r\nvertebræ of the neck articulated as exactly as it did with the fifth;\r\nand, from the configuration of these bones, every anatomist knows this\r\ncould not be the case was there a bone wanting: This is strong\r\npresumption, had we not the completely satisfactory proof of finding\r\nthem all together. And, _2dly_, Among the collections of bones which we\r\nhave seen, we have never met with a single bone resembling a seventh\r\nvertebra of the neck.\r\n\r\nIt was a more difficult task to determine the number of dorsal and\r\nlumber vertebræ, as those we dug up ourselves were not only found much\r\nscattered, but several which had been dug up by the farmer were in the\r\npossession of some of the workmen in the neighbourhood, to the distance\r\nof seven miles round: these we collected with all possible care, and had\r\nthe satisfaction to find they agreed in number with those of the\r\nelephant; still further corroborated by a perfect agreement between them\r\nand the nineteen pair of ribs, leaving three vertebræ for the loins.\r\n\r\nBut in the head the great distinguishing characters are to be found. I\r\nbelieve it has been well enough ascertained that the teeth of this\r\nanimal are perfectly carnivorous, as they have every quality of form and\r\nsubstance that is required: the roots are not in such a massy body as\r\nthe elephant’s, and the teeth are composed of a bony substance\r\nprojecting into strong obtuse points to form the grinding surface, and\r\nall this surface encrusted with a strong coat of enamel; whereas all\r\ngraminivorous animals have teeth whose grinding surface is flat, and\r\ncomposed of an intermixture of bone and enamel; the enamel running in\r\nlaminæ or veins from the surface to the roots. In carnivorous animals\r\nthe surface of the enamel is constantly changing, and is finally worn\r\noff and the teeth rendered useless; but in graminivorous animals the\r\nveins of enamel always present the same figure, only that in youth they\r\nare regularly protuberant, and in age regularly worn down by a\r\nside-motion of the under jaw, which all of them have. The jaw of the\r\nMammoth was incapable of this motion, as is very evident from the\r\ncondyloid process, which is finished with an oblong head inserted into a\r\ntransverse groove; and from the teeth, which are worn, not horizontally,\r\nbut the lower front ones on the inside, the upper front ones on the\r\noutside; the lower back ones on the outside in part, and the upper back\r\nones on the inside in part; in such a manner that they fit into each\r\nother like the teeth of two saws, and when shut are immoveable; and\r\nhence were certainly incapable of masticating, like graminivorous\r\nanimals, either grass or leaves. These teeth were supposed by some\r\nwriters, Buffon, Croghan and Collinson among others, to have been the\r\nteeth of the hippopotamus, deposited in these places, together with the\r\nremains of elephants, in the general deluge; but they are very different\r\nfrom those of the hippopotamus, the largest of which have only three\r\nobtuse points composing the surface, arranged triangularly; whereas the\r\nsmallest teeth in this animal have three rows of double points arranged\r\nparallel to each other, and the largest ones four and five in the same\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nAlthough a simple comparison between the teeth of this animal and the\r\nelephant be sufficient to prove that the former is as certainly of a\r\ncarnivorous as the latter of a graminivorous nature, yet the anatomist\r\nin examining further, will find complete satisfaction, from the internal\r\nstructure of the jaw, as well as the position and growth of the teeth. I\r\nshall only observe here, that in the jaw of this animal, like those of\r\nall others of a carnivorous nature, the roots or fangs are inserted into\r\nthe mass of bone, which not only surrounds the roots, but divides one\r\ntooth from the other; whereas in the elephant the grinders occupy one\r\nlarge and uniform cavity, from which they are gradually protruded as\r\nthey are required for the purpose of grinding. To those who wish to\r\nstudy this subject more profoundly, it will be well to read, in the\r\nPhilosophical Transactions for 1799, two learned papers by Mr. Corse and\r\nMr. Home.\r\n\r\nBetween the temporal bone of this animal and that of the elephant there\r\nis a considerable difference in every part; I shall only observe, that\r\nwhere the socket of the eye in the elephant appears scooped out of the\r\nanterior projection of the temporal bone, in this animal there is not\r\nthe least appearance of such an orbit, but instead thereof, a great mass\r\nof bone.\r\n\r\nTo those who have not seen the originals, words are inadequate to convey\r\na correct idea of the difference in form between the jaw of this animal\r\nand that of the elephant. The under jaw of the elephant terminates in a\r\npoint, which in its direction corresponds with the tusks; the same part\r\nin this animal is composed of a large projection of a foliated\r\nappearance like the leaf of the mallard. And although the lip of the\r\nelephant is large and powerful, in this there appears the origin of one\r\ninfinitely more so; perhaps a long and powerful assistant to the\r\nproboscis which it probably had. There is no positive proof that it had\r\na proboscis, but from the shortness of the neck and magnitude of the\r\ntusks, it is reasonable to suppose that it was furnished with some such\r\ncontrivance; that part in which it must have originated is deficient in\r\nboth skeletons; and although I have met with several accounts of the\r\ndistance between the orbits of the eyes in fragments of heads, they were\r\nnever accompanied with any mention of such place of insertion for a\r\nproboscis.\r\n\r\nThe general form of the under jaw of this animal is made up of three\r\ndistinct angles; one horizontal, on which the jaw rests (when placed on\r\na table), from the front to the back, where a small corner appears cut\r\noff, whence it rises perpendicularly to the condyle. The same view of\r\nthe elephant’s jaw exhibits very nearly a regular portion of a circle\r\nwithout any angles. The arms of this animal’s jaw (composed of the\r\ncondyloid and coronoid processes and their bases), are short as well as\r\nflat, adapted to the peculiar form of the upper jaw, which I shall\r\nproceed to describe; whereas those of the elephant are comparatively\r\nthick, and generally as long as, and frequently longer than, the body of\r\nthe jaw itself: This length is adapted to the great elevation of the\r\ncavity for the condyloid process, taking the level of the teeth as a\r\nbase from which to measure. The angle from the teeth to the condyles of\r\nthe neck in the elephant is at least forty-five degrees, and sometimes\r\nmore; but in the Mammoth the same angle does not exceed ten or fifteen\r\ndegrees; hence the comparative disproportion of their jaws with respect\r\nto length and height.\r\n\r\nIn the back of the elephant’s head there is a very deep cavity for the\r\nreception of muscles from the spines of the back to support the head;\r\nwhich cavity commences immediately from the condyle of the neck: The\r\nback of this animal’s head presents a very different outline, for there\r\nis scarcely any appearance of a cavity; and the whole of the back part\r\nof the head is angular, in contradistinction to that of the elephant,\r\nwhich is composed of two lobes receding forwards from the condyle of the\r\nneck. I have been here particular, as in this respect the two animals\r\nare vastly different, and it may lead to curious speculations concerning\r\nthe structure of the unknown parts and the habits of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe hips were somewhat broken, but the parts uninjured were sufficient\r\nto shew a very different form from those of the elephant, which are high\r\nin comparison with their breadth; and consequently the rump of this\r\nanimal was even more depressed than the elephant’s, in the manner of the\r\nAmerican bison or buffaloe. In the elephant the angles from the _ossæ\r\ntabulæ_ to the lateral processes of the ilium, are very great; whereas\r\nin the Mammoth they are almost on a straight line.\r\n\r\nFrom all the drawings of elephants, and from such of their real ribs as\r\nI have seen, I have observed one universal character; towards their\r\njunction with the cartilage they are broad and more or less bent\r\nsidewise in an undulating form; whereas those of the Mammoth are very\r\nsmall in the same place, and in form without any lateral bend.\r\n\r\nIn the Mammoth the spinus processes are much longer and thicker, in\r\nproportion with the rest of the animal, than they are in the elephant,\r\nwhose head is drawn up close to them by the ligaments attached to the\r\ndeep cavity in the back of the head before-mentioned; in the Mammoth\r\nthis cavity being situated higher from the condyle of the neck and\r\nattached to much longer spines, must act with an advantage proportioned\r\nto the magnitude of the head and the weight of the tusks or defenses.\r\nBesides, these spines are so long, and the form of the ribs such, that\r\nunless we suppose them covered with a superfluous quantity of flesh, the\r\nback of the animal could not have been _round_ like that of the\r\nelephant, but sharp like that of a hog.\r\n\r\nAs the inhabitant of a cold climate, it is probable the Mammoth was\r\nclothed with hair or wool, which in most situations was quickly liable\r\nto decay. The only instance of hair being found with the remains of this\r\nanimal, occurred in a morass belonging to Mr. A. Colden, in the\r\nneighbourhood where this skeleton was found. The hair was coarse, long\r\nand brown, a large mass of it together, and so rotten that, after a few\r\ndays exposure to the air, it fell into a powder.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton of the Mammoth[3], merely as a skeleton, is certainly\r\nentitled to some attention; as the skeleton of a very large and\r\nnon-descript animal it becomes more interesting, to those in particular\r\nwho are disposed to think on the subject; whether its extirpation be\r\nattributed to the power of man, the prevalence of famine, or the violent\r\nand sudden irruption of water. There are many facts to support this\r\nlatter opinion, which I confess myself disposed to adopt.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Strahlenberg, in his Historico-Geographical Description,\r\nobserves, that the Russian name is _Mammoth_, which is a corruption from\r\n_Memoth_, a word derived from the Arabic _Mehemot_, signifying the same\r\nas the _Behemot_ of Job. This word is applied to any animal of\r\nextraordinary size.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOrange and Ulster counties in the state of New York, are situated\r\nwestward of the Hudson and northward of West Point; from the Shawangunk\r\nmountain, which is a long ridge east of the blue mountains, they appear\r\nas an immense plain, bounded on every side by stupendous mountains, the\r\nsituation of which certainly tend to confirm the authenticity of an\r\nIndian tradition, which states them formerly to have been the boundaries\r\nof a great lake; and it would now be a lake if the high mountains on\r\neach side of the Hudson near West Point were united, as probably they\r\nmay have been. It is a fact that all over the country, the stones, which\r\nin a curious manner are strewed over the ground, from the largest to the\r\nsmallest, have been worn round by long-continued friction, as if by the\r\nagitation of water; more particularly in the lowest and flat situations,\r\nwhere the stones are larger, and gradually becoming smaller in the\r\nhigher situations. The surface of the country, though by no means so\r\nlevel as it appears from the mountains, is formed of single hills,\r\nprominences, or swelling knolls, which have the appearance of having\r\nbeen caused by the agitation of water. Many of the cavities between\r\nthese knolls are dry, others are in the state of ponds, but an infinite\r\nnumber contain morasses, which must originally have been ponds, supplied\r\nby springs which still flow at their bottoms, and filled, in the course\r\nof ages, with a succession of shellfish and the decay of vegetables; so\r\nthat at present they are covered with timber, and have been so within\r\nthe memory of man. An old man, upwards of sixty, informed us, that all\r\nthe difference he could remark between these morasses now and what they\r\nwere fifty years ago, was, that then they were generally covered with\r\nfirs, and now with beech. This was verified by the branches and logs of\r\nfir which we found in digging; many pieces of which had been cut by\r\nbeavers, the former inhabitants of these places when in the state of\r\nponds. Scarcely a fir is now to be found in the country.\r\n\r\nOn digging into these morasses you generally have to remove from one to\r\ntwo feet of peat or turf; you then enter on a stratum, from one to two\r\nfeet thick, of what the farmers call the yellow marle, composed of\r\nvegetable earth intermixed with long yellow roots; next the grey marle,\r\nwhich resembles wet ashes, to the further depth of two feet; and finally\r\na bed of decayed shells, which they call shell-marle, the upper surface\r\nof which forms a horizontal line across the morass, consequently it is\r\nthicker in the center than at the edges; under this, forming the bottom\r\nof the pond or morass, is found gravel and slate covering a thick\r\nstratum of clay. It was in the white and yellow marle the bones were\r\ngenerally found; those in the white in the highest preservation, less so\r\nin the grey; and where an end happened to rise into the yellow stratum\r\nit was proportionally decayed: One cause of this must have been the\r\naccession of air when the springs in dry seasons were low.\r\n\r\nThe grey marle, in which most of the bones lay, by analysis was found to\r\ncontain seventy-three parts in the hundred of lime: when dried in the\r\nsun it cracks into thin horizontal laminæ, and becomes extremely light,\r\nas hard as baked clay, and brittle; in this state it burns with a bright\r\nflame for a long while, and instead of leaving ashes, it remains a\r\nstrong black coal, apparently well adapted to the purposes of the arts.\r\n\r\nThese various strata are the production of a long succession of ages,\r\nand, in my opinion, have been formed over the bones. In two of the\r\nmorasses there was not depth sufficient to have bemired an animal of\r\nsuch magnitude and strength; and in the third the bones were lying near\r\nthe sloping edge, from which some of them had already been washed\r\nfarther in: The animals have either died or been destroyed generally\r\nover the country, and only in these situations have been preserved; or\r\nthey have sought these cool places to die in; or perhaps both.\r\n\r\nNo calculation can be made of the length of time necessary to have\r\nformed these morasses, although we are certain that, as in fifty years\r\npast scarcely any change appears, it must have been proportionally\r\nslower in the commencement; and a period has elapsed in which all\r\naccounts of this animal have dwindled into oblivion, except a confused\r\nIndian tradition.\r\n\r\nIn the neighbourhood of these morasses are found an infinite number of\r\npetrifactions, a few specimens of which I have brought with me: they are\r\nin strange and unknown figures, and appear to be generally marine\r\nproductions, as various species of coral and sea-urchins were likewise\r\nfound among them. Two revolutions in nature must have contributed to\r\nthis effect; one in which the petrifactions were formed by a copious\r\nincrustation of calcareous matter, in a semifluid state; and a\r\nsubsequent one, in which the stones have been broken to pieces, worn\r\ninto a round shape, and finally deposited, an hundred miles from the\r\nsea, and many hundreds from those seas where corals are produced.\r\n\r\nHere a question of some importance arises; could this animal have been\r\ndestroyed in a deluge, which must have been sudden and powerful enough\r\nto produce those great effects? And was the entire race of them thereby\r\nrendered extinct? Certain it is that they are no where to be found, nor\r\ntheir footsteps traced. Among the Indians of North America, from nation\r\nto nation, the tradition has spread and prevails, which relates their\r\nformer existence and their sudden extirpation. I shall here give a\r\ntradition, said to be in the very terms of a Shawanee Indian, as\r\npublished in Winterbotham’s History of America, which appears in an\r\nembellished dress from an English pen, but founded on a real tradition.\r\nI have questioned, through their interpreters, various and distant\r\nnations of Indians, and have known of many others, and all their\r\naccounts agree in the main story, though they vary in some of the\r\nsubordinate parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           INDIAN TRADITION.\r\n\r\n“Ten thousand moons ago, when nought but gloomy forests covered this\r\nland of the sleeping sun; long before the pale men, with thunder and\r\nfire at their command, rushed on the wings of the wind to ruin this\r\ngarden of nature; when nought but the untamed wanderers of the woods,\r\nand men as unrestrained as they, were the lords of the soil; a race of\r\nanimals existed, _huge as the frowning precipice_, cruel as the bloody\r\npanther, swift as the descending eagle, and terrible as the angel of\r\nnight. The pines _crashed_ beneath their feet, and the lake _shrunk_\r\nwhen they slaked their thirst; the forceful javelin in vain was hurled,\r\nand the barbed arrow fell harmless from their side. Forests were laid\r\nwaste at a meal; the groans of expiring animals were every where heard;\r\nand whole villages, inhabited by men, were destroyed in a moment. The\r\ncry of universal distress extended even to the region of peace in the\r\nwest; and the good Spirit interposed to save the unhappy. The forked\r\nlightning gleamed around, and loudest thunder rocked the globe! The\r\nbolts of heaven were hurled upon the cruel destroyers alone, and the\r\nmountains echoed with the bellowings of death. All were killed except\r\none male, the fiercest of the race, and him even the artillery of the\r\nskies assailed in vain. He ascended the bluest summit which shades the\r\nsource of the Monangahela, and, roaring aloud, bid defiance to every\r\nvengeance. The red lightning scorched the lofty firs, and rived the\r\nknotty oaks, but only glanced upon the enraged monster. At length,\r\nmaddened with fury, he leaped over the waves of the west at a bound, and\r\nthis moment reigns the uncontrouled monarch of the wilderness, in\r\ndespite of even Omnipotence itself.”\r\n\r\nThe idea of a carnivorous animal, which the Indians appear to have had\r\nof it, corresponds with the teeth of this; and the name Bull, which they\r\ngive to it, might have been derived from the hornlike appearance of the\r\ntusks; but it is perhaps still more probable, that in the course of time\r\nthe ideas of two distinct animals are confounded; for I have brought\r\nwith me a plaister cast from a bone presented last June to the\r\nPhilosophical Society of Philadelphia, by Major Brown, of Kentucky: it\r\nis unquestionably a fragment of an animal of the ox kind, but of a most\r\nstupendous magnitude. It consists of a large portion of one side of the\r\nback part of the head, and part of the other; and the internal substance\r\nor pith, which was covered by the horn, twenty-one inches in\r\ncircumference, and with the horn on it, must have been at least\r\ntwenty-four or twenty-five. This bone was found, in a creek which\r\nempties into the Ohio, some years ago, and by the proprietors supposed\r\nto have been part of the Mammoth. It is impregnated with ferruginous\r\nearth, and in high preservation; and must have been broken with\r\nviolence, but no one knows of any other portion of it.\r\n\r\nVarious bones, generally pieces of the head of the oxen kind, have been\r\nfound in all parts of Europe and in Asia, having the same character\r\nwhich distinguishes the one from which this cast was made, in the form\r\nand direction of the horn; it descends backwards, and then rising,\r\npoints forwards. There are several specimens of these in the British\r\nMuseum, but none so large as this.\r\n\r\nA few years since some large bones, of an uncommon kind, were found in a\r\ncave in Virginia, highly preserved by lying in earth abounding with\r\nnitre. They were sent to the Philosophical Society, and an account of\r\nthem published in the fourth volume of their Transactions: By permission\r\nof the Society, I have made accurate casts of them.\r\n\r\nHence it appears that four animals of enormous magnitude have formerly\r\nexisted in America, perhaps at the same time, and of natures very\r\nopposite: _1st_, The Mammoth, carnivorous; _2d_, An animal whose\r\ngraminivorous teeth, larger than, and different from, those of the\r\nelephant, are sometimes found; _3d_, The great Indian bull; and, _4th_,\r\nAn animal probably of the sloth kind, as appears on comparison with the\r\nbones found in Virginia, and a skeleton found in South America, and\r\npreserved in the Museum at Madrid.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson, on the Mammoth bones, says, “To whatever animal we\r\nascribe these remains, it is certain such a one has existed in America,\r\nand that it has been the largest of all terrestrial beings. It should\r\nhave sufficed to have rescued the earth it inhabited and the atmosphere\r\nit breathed, from the imputation of impotence in the conception and\r\nnourishment of animal life on a large scale; to have stifled in its\r\nbirth, the opinion of a writer[4], the most learned too of all others in\r\nthe science of animal history, that, in the new world, ‘_La nature\r\nvivante est beaucoup moins agissante, beaucoup moins forte_:’ That\r\nnature is less active, less energetic on one side of the globe than she\r\nis on the other.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Buffon.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was my intention to have closed this account with Dr. Dunter’s essay,\r\nwhose accuracy in the examination, and knowledge in the discrimination\r\nof those few bones which were within his reach, had already given to his\r\nopinion the weight of unquestionable authority; but as his paper was\r\nsomewhat long, and as the facts since he wrote are more numerous, and\r\nsubject in the skeleton which we have, to the examination of every one;\r\nI shall only introduce his concluding sentence, that, “If this animal\r\nwas indeed carnivorous, which I believe cannot be doubted, though we may\r\nas philosophers regret it, as men we cannot but thank Heaven that its\r\nwhole generation is probably extinct.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                      DIMENSIONS OF THE SKELETON.\r\n\r\n                                                          Ft.
