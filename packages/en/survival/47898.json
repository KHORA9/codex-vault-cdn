Most of the exercises involved demand exact\r\nstudy by means of a good hand-lens, a mode of investigation far too\r\nmuch neglected in modern teaching. The book is not intended to be a\r\ncomplete manual of grasses, but to be an account of our common native\r\nspecies, so arranged that the student may learn how to closely observe\r\nand deal with the distinctive characters of these remarkable plants\r\nwhen such problems as the botanical analysis of a meadow or pasture,\r\nof hay, of weeds, or of “seed” grasses are presented, as well as when\r\ninvestigating questions of more abstract scientific nature.\r\n\r\nI have not hesitated, however, to introduce general statements on the\r\nbiology and physiological peculiarities of grasses where such may serve\r\nthe purpose of interesting the reader in the wider botanical bearings\r\nof the subject, though several reasons may be urged against extending\r\nthis part of the theme in a book intended to be portable, and of direct\r\npractical use to students in the field.\r\n\r\nI have pleasure in expressing my thanks to Mr R. H. Biffen for\r\ncarefully testing the classification of “seeds” on pp. 135-174, and to\r\nhim and to Mr Shipley for kindly looking over the proofs; also to Mr\r\nLewton-Brain, who has tested the classification of leaf-sections put\r\nforward on pp. 72-82, and prepared the drawings for Figs. 21-28.\r\n\r\nThat errors are entirely absent from such a work as this is perhaps too\r\nmuch to expect: I hope they are few, and that readers will oblige me\r\nwith any corrections they may find necessary or advantageous for the\r\nbetter working of the tables.\r\n\r\nThe list of the chief authorities referred to, which students who\r\ndesire to proceed further with the study of grasses should consult, is\r\ngiven at the end.\r\n\r\nI have pleasure in acknowledging my indebtedness to the following\r\nworks for illustrations which are inserted by permission of the\r\nseveral publishers:--Stebler’s _Forage Plants_ (published by Nutt &\r\nCo.), Nobbe’s _Handbuch der Samenkunde_ (Wiegandt, Hempel and Parey,\r\nBerlin), Harz’s _Landwirthschaftliche Samenkunde_ (Paul Parey, Berlin),\r\nStrasburger and Noll’s _Text-Book of Botany_ (Macmillan & Co.),\r\nFiguier’s _Vegetable World_ (Cassell & Co.), Lubbock’s _Flowers, Fruits\r\nand Seeds_ (Macmillan & Co.), Kerner’s _Natural History of Plants_\r\n(Blackie & Son), and Oliver’s _First Book of Indian Botany_ (Macmillan\r\n& Co.).\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to avoid the question of variation in work of this\r\nkind, and students will without doubt come across instances--especially\r\nin such genera as _Agropyrum_, _Festuca_, _Agrostis_ and _Bromus_--of\r\nsmall variations which show how impossible it is to fit the facts\r\nof living organisms into the rigid frames of classification. It\r\nmay possibly be urged that this invalidates all attempts at such\r\nclassifications: the same argument applies to all our systems, though\r\nit is perhaps less disastrous to the best Natural Systems which attempt\r\nto take in large groups of facts, than to artificial systems selected\r\nfor special purposes. Perhaps something useful may be learned by\r\nshowing more clearly where and how grasses vary, and I hope that the\r\napplication to them of these preliminary tests may elucidate more facts\r\nas we proceed.\r\n\r\nH.

Some species are\r\ncosmopolitan--e.g. our common Reed, _Arundo Phragmites_; while\r\nothers--e.g. several of our native species of _Festuca_ and _Poa_--are\r\nequally common in both hemispheres. On the whole the Tropics afford\r\nmost species and fewest individuals, and the temperate regions most\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nConsidering their multifarious uses as fodder and food, for brewing,\r\nweaving, building and a thousand other purposes, it is perhaps not too\r\nmuch to say that if every other species of plant were displaced by\r\ngrasses of all kinds--as many indeed gradually are--man would still be\r\nable to supply his chief needs from them.\r\n\r\nThe profound significance of the grass-carpet of the earth, however,\r\ncomes out most clearly when we realise the enormous amounts of energy\r\ndaily stored up in the countless myriads of green blades as they fix\r\ntheir carbon. By decomposing the carbon-dioxide of the air in their\r\nchlorophyll apparatus by the action of the radiant energy of the sun,\r\nthey build up starches and sugars and other plant-substances, which are\r\nthen consumed and turned into flesh by our cattle and sheep and other\r\nherbivorous animals, and so furnish us with food. The whole theory of\r\nagriculture turns on this pivot, and the by no means small modicum of\r\ntruth in such sayings as “All flesh is grass,” and that the man who can\r\nmake two blades of grass grow where one grew before deserves well of\r\nhis country, obtains a larger significance when it is realised that the\r\nonly real gain of wealth is that represented by the storage of energy\r\nfrom without which comes to us by the action of green leaves waving in\r\nthe sunshine.\r\n\r\nThe true Grasses, comprising the Natural Order Graminaceæ--also written\r\nGramineæ--are often popularly confounded with other herbs which possess\r\nnarrow green ribbon-like leaves, or even with plants of very different\r\naspects--e.g. Cotton-grass (_Eriophorum_) and other Sedges, and the\r\nnames Rib-grass (_Plantago_), Knot-grass (_Polygonum_), Scorpion-grass\r\n(_Myosotis_) and Sea-grass (_Zostera_), as well as the general usage of\r\nthe word grass to signify all kinds of leguminous and other hay-plants\r\nin agriculture, point to the wider use of the word in former times.\r\nThis has been explained by the use of the words _gaers_, _gres_,\r\n_gyrs_, and grass in the old herbals to indicate any kind of small\r\nherbage.\r\n\r\nIn view of the importance of our British grasses in agriculture, I\r\nhave here put together some results of observation and reading in the\r\nhope that they may aid students in recognising easily our ordinary\r\nagricultural and wild grasses. During several years of work in the\r\nfields, principally directed at first to the study of the parasitic\r\nfungi on grasses, and subsequently to that of the importance of grasses\r\nin forestry and agriculture, and to the variations they exhibit, the\r\nneed of some guide to the identification of a grass at any time of\r\nthe year, whether in flower or not, forced itself on the attention,\r\nand although a botanist naturally turns to a good Flora when he has\r\nthe grass in flower, as the best and quickest way of ascertaining\r\nthe species, it soon became evident that much may be done by the\r\nstudy of the leaves and vegetative parts of most grasses. Indeed\r\nsome are recognisable at a glance by certain characters well known\r\nto continental observers: in the case of others the matter is more\r\ndifficult, and perhaps with a few it is impossible to be certain of the\r\nspecies from such characters only.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, while the best means for the determination of species\r\nare always in the floral characters so well worked up in the Floras of\r\nHooker, Bentham and others, there is unquestionably much value in the\r\ncharacters of the vegetative organs also, as the works of Jessen, Lund,\r\nStebler, Vesque and others abroad, and Sinclair, Parnell, Sowerby and\r\nothers in this country attest.\r\n\r\nAlmost the only plants confounded with true grasses by the ordinary\r\nobserver are the sedges and a few rushes. Apart from the very different\r\nfloral structures, there are two or three easily discoverable marks for\r\ndistinguishing all our grasses from other plants (Fig. 1). The first is\r\ntheir leaves are arranged in _two rows_, alternately, up the stems; and\r\nthe second that their stems are circular or flattened in section, or if\r\nof some other shape they are _never triangular_ and _solid_[1] (Figs.\r\n6 and 7). Moreover the leaves are always of some elongated shape, and\r\nwithout leaf-stalks[2], but pass below into a _sheath_, which runs\r\nsome way down the stem and is nearly always perceptibly split (Figs.\r\n8-13). Further, the stems themselves are usually terete, and distinctly\r\nhollow except at the swollen nodes, and only branch low down at the\r\nsurface of the ground or below it[3].\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. A plant of Oat (_Avena_), an example of a\r\ntypical grass, showing tufted habit and loose paniculate inflorescence\r\n(reduced). Figuier.]\r\n\r\nAll our native grasses are herbaceous, and none of them attain very\r\nlarge dimensions. In the following lists I term those small which\r\naverage about 6-18 inches in the height of the tufts, whereas those\r\nover 3 feet high may be termed large, the tufts being regarded as\r\nin flower. The sizes cannot be given very accurately, and starved\r\nspecimens are frequently found dwarfed, but in most cases these\r\naverages are not far wrong for the species freely growing as ordinarily\r\nmet with, and in some cases are useful. I have omitted the rare species\r\nthroughout, and in the annexed lists have added the popular names.\r\n\r\n\r\nLARGE GRASSES.\r\n\r\n(Over 3 feet.)\r\n\r\n  _Milium effusum_ (Millet-grass).\r\n  _Digraphis arundinacea_ (Reed-grass).\r\n  _Aira cæspitosa_ (Tufted Hair-grass).\r\n  _Arrhenatherum avenaceum_ (False Oat).\r\n  _Elymus arenarius_ (Lyme-grass).\r\n  _Bromus asper_ (Hairy Brome).\r\n  _B. giganteus_ (Tall Brome).\r\n  _Festuca elatior_ (Meadow Fescue).\r\n  _F. sylvatica_ (Reed Fescue).\r\n  _Glyceria aquatica_ (Reed Sweet-grass).\r\n  _G. fluitans_ (Floating Sweet-grass).\r\n  _Arundo Phragmites_ (Common Reed).\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDIUM GRASSES.\r\n\r\n(1-3 feet.)\r\n\r\n  _Phleum pratense_ (Timothy).\r\n  _Avena pratensis_ (Perennial Oat-grass).\r\n  _Anthoxanthum odoratum_ (Sweet Vernal).\r\n  _Alopecurus agrestis_ (Slender Foxtail).\r\n  _A. pratensis_ (Meadow Foxtail).\r\n  _Agrostis alba_ (Fiorin).\r\n  _Psamma arenaria_ (Sea Mat-grass).\r\n  _Avena flavescens_ (Yellow Oat-grass).\r\n  _Holcus lanatus_ (Yorkshire Fog).\r\n  _Hordeum sylvaticum_ (Wood Barley).\r\n  _H. pratense_ (Meadow Barley).\r\n  _Agropyrum repens_ (Couch-grass).\r\n  _A. caninum_ (Fibrous Twitch).\r\n  _Lolium italicum_ (Italian Rye-grass).\r\n  _Brachypodium sylvaticum_ (Wood False-Brome).\r\n  _B. pinnatum_ (Heath False-Brome).\r\n  _Bromus erectus_ (Upright Brome).\r\n  _B. sterilis_ (Barren Brome).\r\n  _B. arvensis_ (Field Brome).\r\n  _Festuca ovina_ (var. _rubra_, &c.).

In stoloniferous grasses a similar\r\ndifficulty of removal may be caused in a slighter degree by the\r\nunderground stems. In a few cases, e.g. _Alopecurus bulbosus_ (Fig. 3),\r\n_Poa bulbosa_, _Phleum pratense_ and _P. Bœhmeri_, _Arrhenatherum\r\navenaceum_, and to a slighter extent in _Poa alpina_ and one or two\r\nothers, the lowermost internodes and sheaths of the stems may be\r\nswollen and stored with food-materials, and a sort of _tuber_ or _bulb_\r\nresults; this is especially apt to occur in dry sandy soils. In old\r\nlawns, pastures, &c., the roots of _Poa annua_ and others may have\r\nnodules on them due to the presence of certain small Nematode worms,\r\n_Heterodera_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. _Nardus stricta._ Plant showing tufted habit,\r\nand simple spikate inflorescence, with pointed spikelets all turned\r\ntowards one side (secund) on the rachis (reduced). Note also the\r\nbristle-like (setaceous) leaves at length reflexed. Parnell.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. _Alopecurus geniculatus_, var. _bulbosus_.

Parnell.]\r\n\r\nGrasses are annual, biennial, or perennial, and it is often of\r\nimportance to know which. The point may usually be determined by\r\nexamining the shoots. If all the shoots have flowering stems in them,\r\nand are evidently of the current year, the grass is an annual; but if\r\nany shoots have leaves only, it is either biennial or perennial: to\r\ndetermine which is not always easy, but in perennial grasses there\r\nwill generally be evident remains of older leaf-bases and shoots, and\r\nif there are distinct underground stolons or creeping rhizomes as well\r\nthe point may be considered decided, and the grass is perennial, as\r\nis the case with most of our important species. If all the shoots are\r\nbarren, the grass is a biennial in its first year of growth: if all\r\nhave flowering stems in them, but show traces of old leaf-bases of the\r\nprevious year, then the grass is a biennial in its second year. The\r\nproof of biennial character is not always easy, however, and a few\r\ngrasses may be either annual or biennial, or biennial or perennial,\r\naccording to conditions--e.g. species of _Hordeum_, _Bromus_, &c. In\r\nthe following lists I have given the duration of the principal grasses,\r\nwhere the character is especially important.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUALS.\r\n\r\n  _Phleum arenarium._\r\n  _Aira præcox._\r\n  _A. caryophyllea._\r\n  _Hordeum murinum._\r\n  _H. maritimum._\r\n  _Lolium temulentum._\r\n  _Festuca Myurus._\r\n  _Briza minor._\r\n  _Poa rigida._\r\n  _P. annua._\r\n\r\n\r\nANNUALS\r\n\r\nwhich may become biennial or perennial.\r\n\r\n  _Alopecurus geniculatus._\r\n  _Hordeum pratense._\r\n  _Lolium perenne._\r\n  _L. italicum_ (may be perennial).\r\n  _Bromus asper_ (may be perennial).\r\n  _B. sterilis._\r\n  _B. arvensis_ (may be perennial).\r\n\r\n\r\nPERENNIALS.\r\n\r\n  _Holcus lanatus._\r\n  _H. mollis._\r\n  _Nardus._\r\n  _Hordeum sylvaticum._\r\n  _Agropyrum._\r\n  _Brachypodium._\r\n  _Bromus erectus._\r\n  _B. giganteus._\r\n  _Festuca ovina._\r\n  _F. elatior._\r\n  _F. sylvatica._\r\n  _Dactylis._\r\n  _Cynosurus cristatus._\r\n  _Briza media._\r\n  _Milium._\r\n  _Anthoxanthum._\r\n  _Digraphis._\r\n  _Phleum pratense._\r\n  _Alopecurus pratensis._\r\n  _Agrostis alba._\r\n  _A. canina._\r\n  _Psamma._\r\n  _Aira cæspitosa._\r\n  _A. flexuosa._\r\n  _A. canescens._\r\n  _Avena pratensis._\r\n  _A. flavescens._\r\n  _Arrhenatherum._\r\n  _Glyceria aquatica._\r\n  _G. fluitans._\r\n  _Poa maritima._\r\n  _P. compressa._\r\n  _P. pratensis._\r\n  _P. trivialis._\r\n  _P. nemoralis._\r\n  _P. alpina._\r\n  _P. bulbosa._\r\n  _Molinia._\r\n  _Melica._\r\n  _Triodia._\r\n  _Kœleria._\r\n  _Arundo._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. _Catabrosa aquatica._ Plant showing the creeping\r\nhabit, rooting nodes, and paniculate inflorescence (reduced). Parnell.]\r\n\r\nThe rhizome of a perennial grass is continued sympodially by means of\r\nbuds branching from the lowermost joints of the flowering shoots, and\r\nsome importance is attached to the mode of spreading of these lateral\r\nsprouting shoots. The buds always arise in the axils of the lower\r\nleaf-sheaths--i.e. they are _intra-vaginal_. If they remain\r\nintra-vaginal during further growth, the shoots are forced upwards and\r\nonly _tufts_ (Fig. 2) are formed, except in so far as such shoots may\r\nfall prostrate on the surface of the ground later, and throw out roots\r\nfrom their nodes, and so act as _runners_ or offsets, or put out a few\r\nroots &c. as they ascend through the soil. But in many cases the buds\r\nsoon burst through the leaf-sheaths, and develope as _extra-vaginal_\r\nshoots, and may then run horizontally as underground _stolons_.\r\nOnly creeping grasses of these latter kinds can rapidly cover large\r\nareas[4]: the grasses with intra-vaginal shoots only can only make\r\ntufts or “tussocks.” Several peculiarities in the habits of grasses\r\ndepend on these facts. The following are the most important creeping,\r\nor _stoloniferous_ species, contrasted with the much more common\r\n_tufted_ and the far rarer grasses with _runners_ above ground (Fig.\r\n4). Some of these (_Elymus_, _Psamma_, &c.) are of great importance as\r\nsand-binders.—\r\n\r\n\r\nWith intra-vaginal branches only.\r\n\r\n  _Lolium_--slightly stoloniferous.\r\n  _Festuca elatior_--slightly stoloniferous.\r\n  _Avena flavescens_--slightly stoloniferous.\r\n  _Phleum pratense_--no stolons, but may be bulbous.\r\n  _Dactylis_--no stolons.\r\n  _Festuca ovina_--no stolons.\r\n  _Poa alpina_--no stolons.\r\n  _Cynosurus_--no stolons.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith extra-vaginal shoots.\r\n\r\n  _Arrhenatherum_--short stolons, sometimes bulbous.\r\n  _Holcus lanatus_--creeping.\r\n  _Alopecurus pratensis_--long stolons.\r\n  _Anthoxanthum_--slightly stoloniferous.\r\n  _Agrostis alba_ (var. _stolonifera_)--long stolons and runners.\r\n  _Digraphis_--long stolons.\r\n  _Poa pratensis_--long stolons.\r\n  _P. trivialis_--runners only.\r\n  _Festuca heterophylla_, Lam.--a variety of _F. ovina_ with slight\r\n    stolons.\r\n  _F. rubra_ (Linn.)--a variety of _F. ovina_ with long stolons.\r\n  _Bromus erectus_--no stolons.\r\n  _B. inermis_--long stolons.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreeping below ground and truly stoloniferous.\r\n\r\n  _Agropyrum._\r\n  _Elymus._\r\n  _Psamma._\r\n  _Poa pratensis._\r\n  _P. compressa._\r\n  _Agrostis alba_ (var. _stolonifera_).\r\n  _Alopecurus pratensis._\r\n  _Brachypodium_ (slightly).\r\n  _Bromus erectus_ (slightly).\r\n  _Festuca ovina_ (var. _rubra_, Linn.).\r\n  _F. elatior_ (slightly).\r\n  _Briza_ (slightly).\r\n  _Glyceria._\r\n  _Poa maritima._\r\n  _Melica._\r\n  _Arundo._\r\n\r\n\r\nTufted Grasses.\r\n\r\n  _Milium._\r\n  _Agrostis alba_ (on downs, &c.).\r\n  _Aira cæspitosa._\r\n  _A. flexuosa._\r\n  _A. canescens._\r\n  _A. præcox._\r\n  _A. caryophyllea._\r\n  _Avena pratensis_ (slightly creeping).\r\n  _Arrhenatherum._\r\n  _Nardus_ (Fig. 2).\r\n  _Hordeum sylvaticum._\r\n  _Lolium._\r\n  _Bromus._\r\n  _Festuca ovina_ (except some varieties).\r\n  _F. sylvatica._\r\n  _F.

Parnell.]\r\n\r\nIn most grasses the blades are _convolute_--i.e. rolled up like the\r\npaper of a cigarette, one edge over the other--and the section of\r\nthe shoot is round (Fig. 7). In some cases, however, the leaves are\r\n_conduplicate_--i.e. each half of the lamina is folded flat on the\r\nother, the upper sides being turned face to face inwards, with the\r\nmid-rib as the hinge--and in this case the shoots are more or less\r\ncompressed (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. _Dactylis glomerata._ Transverse section of a\r\nleaf-shoot (× 5). _A_, conduplicate leaf-blade. _B_, sheath.

Compare Fig. 14.\r\nStebler.]\r\n\r\nIn these latter cases the transverse section may be elliptical--e.g.\r\n_Poa pratensis_ and _P. alpina_, _Briza_, &c., or more flattened\r\nand linear-oblong--e.g. _Glyceria fluitans_--with the flattened\r\nsides straight, or the section is oval but pointed more or less at\r\neach end owing to projecting keels and leaf-edges, and the form is\r\n_naviculate_--e.g. _Glyceria aquatica_, _Dactylis_ (Fig. 6)--or, the\r\nsides being less flattened, more or less _rhomboidal_ as in _Poa\r\ntrivialis_. In _Melica_ the leaves are convolute and the shoot-section\r\n_quadrangular_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFlat, and usually sharp-edged shoots.\r\n\r\n  _Dactylis glomerata_ (Fig. 6).\r\n  _Poa trivialis_, _P. annua_, _P. pratensis_, _P. compressa_,\r\n    _P. maritima_, and _P. alpina_.\r\n  _Glyceria aquatica_ and _G. fluitans_.\r\n  _Avena pubescens._\r\n  _Lolium perenne._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE VEGETATIVE ORGANS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe leaves of all our grasses consist of the _blade_, which passes\r\ndirectly into the _sheath_, without any petiole or leaf-stalk (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nThe sheath is usually obviously _split_, and so rolled round the\r\ninternode that one edge overlaps the other, but in the following\r\ngrasses the sheath is either quite _entire_, or only slit a short way\r\ndown, the two edges being fused as it were for the greater part of its\r\nlength.\r\n\r\nSheath more or less entire.\r\n\r\n  _Glyceria aquatica_ and _G. fluitans_.\r\n  _Melica uniflora_ and _M. nutans_.\r\n  _Dactylis glomerata._\r\n  _Poa trivialis_ (Fig. 8), _P. pratensis_, _P. alpina_.\r\n  _Sesleria cærulea._\r\n  _Bromus_ (all the species).\r\n  _Briza media_ and _B. minor_.\r\n\r\nIn some cases--e.g. _Arrhenatherum_, _Bromus asper_, and _Holcus\r\nlanatus_--the sheath is marked with a more or less prominent ridge\r\ndown its back, due to the continuation of the _keel_ of the leaf. The\r\nsheath may also be glabrous or hairy, and grooved or not.\r\n\r\nA few grasses are so apt to develope characteristic colours in their\r\nsheaths, especially below, that they may often be recognised in winter\r\nby this peculiarity.\r\n\r\n\r\nSheaths coloured.\r\n\r\n  _Lolium_--all red.\r\n  _Holcus_--red with purple veins.\r\n  _Festuca elatior_--red.\r\n  _Cynosurus_--yellow.\r\n  _Alopecurus pratensis_, and\r\n  _A. agrestis_--violet-brown, &c.\r\n  _Festuca ovina_, var. _rubra_--red.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. _Poa trivialis. A_, base of blade. _B_,\r\nligule. _C_, sheath. _D_, culm (× about 3).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. _Alopecurus pratensis. A_, base of blade. _B_,\r\nligule. _C_, sheath. Slightly magnified.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. _Avena flavescens._ Lettering as before (× 2).\r\nNote the split sheath, the hairs and ridges. Stebler.]\r\n\r\nAt the junction of the blade with the sheath there is in most cases a\r\ndelicate membranous upgrowth of the former, more or less appressed to\r\nthe stem, and called the _Ligule_ (Figs. 8-13). Its use is probably\r\nto facilitate the shedding of water which has run down the leaf; and\r\nso lessen the danger of rotting between the sheath and stem: possibly\r\nthe shelves and ears commonly met with at the base of the lamina (Fig.\r\n12) aid in the same process. This ligule may be long or short, acute\r\nor obtuse, toothed or entire, or it may be reduced to a mere line, or\r\ntuft of hairs, or even be obsolete, and is of considerable value in\r\nclassification--e.g. the ligule is obsolete or wanting in _Melica_,\r\n_Festuca ovina_, _F. Myurus_, _F. elatior_, _Kœleria_ and _Panicum_.\r\n\r\nIt is represented by a tuft of hairs in _Molinia_, _Triodia_ and\r\n_Arundo_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. _Lolium perenne. A_, base of lamina, _B_,\r\nligule. _C_, sheath (× 3). Note the low ribs, and absence of hairs\r\n(glabrous).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. _Festuca elatior_, var. _pratensis_. _A_, base\r\nof lamina. _B_, the extremely short ligule, with pointed ears. _C_,\r\nsheath (× 3).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13. _Festuca ovina. A_, base of lamina. _B_,\r\nligular ears. _C_, sheath (× about 4). Stebler.]\r\n\r\nOur other ordinary grasses have a more or less well-developed\r\n_membranous_ ligule (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\nThe leaf-blade is long or short, broad or narrow, but always of some\r\nelongated form such as linear, linear-lanceolate or linear-acuminate,\r\nor subulate, setaceous, &c., varying as to the degree of acuteness of\r\nthe apex, and the tapering of the base.\r\n\r\nIn the following native grasses the _form_ of the lamina affords a\r\nuseful character.\r\n\r\nThe base tapers to the sheath below--i.e. the leaf is more or less\r\nlinear-lanceolate--in _Molinia_, _Brachypodium_, _Melica_, _Milium_,\r\n_Kœleria_, and the very rare _Hierochloe_; less distinctly so\r\nin _Bromus asper_ and species of _Hordeum_. The base is rounded in\r\n_Arundo_. In the following cases the leaves are setaceous, due to the\r\nvery narrow blade remaining permanently folded or inrolled at its\r\nedges, and usually being thickened and hardened also (Figs. 13 and 18).\r\nThe habitat of these moor-and heath-grasses suggests that these are no\r\ndoubt adaptations to prevent excessive evaporation by the exposure of\r\ntoo large a surface--e.g. various species of _Aira_, _Festuca ovina_,\r\n_F. Myurus_ and allies, _Nardus_, and several other species; whereas,\r\nconversely, the thin flat leaves of shade-grasses facilitate exposure\r\nto light and transpiration. In _Avena pratensis_ and _Agrostis canina_\r\nsome of the leaves are involute and subulate, and the thickened leaves\r\nof _Poa maritima_ also are turned up at the edges, and are +U+-shaped\r\nin cross-section.\r\n\r\nAs we shall see later the degree of inrolling of many grass leaves\r\nvaries with circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn most others the blades are either flat (Figs. 8-12), or more or\r\nless conduplicate on the mid-rib. The latter case occurs, for example,\r\nin grasses with flattened shoots, especially at the lower part of the\r\nblade--e.g. _Lolium perenne_, _Dactylis_, _Glyceria_, and some species\r\nof _Poa_, and the cross-section of the leaf below, just before it\r\nenters the sheath, is +V+-shaped. In _Glyceria_ the leaf-bases may show\r\nyellow or brownish triangles.\r\n\r\nFurther characters of the leaves are derived from their texture, apex,\r\nmargins, mid-ribs and venation, hairiness, and especially the presence\r\nand characters of the longitudinal ridges which run along the upper or\r\nlower surface in many cases.\r\n\r\nThe venation is parallel from base to apex in nearly all our grasses,\r\nbut such is not always the case--e.g. in the exotic _Panicum plicatum_\r\nthe mid-rib, which enters the leaf with several vascular bundles,\r\ngives off strong and weak veins below, which first diverge and then\r\nrun in arches which converge upwards: this leaf is also remarkable in\r\nbeing _plaited_ (plicate) in vernation. In _Arundo Donax_ also the\r\nveins, though approximately parallel, do not all run to the apex of the\r\ntapering leaf; the outer ones end above in the margins and are shorter\r\nthan the mid-rib.\r\n\r\nAs regards _texture_, the leaves of most grasses are thin and\r\nherbaceous; but in some they are dry and harsh to the touch. They are\r\nthin and dry in _Agropyrum caninum_, _Hordeum pratense_, _H. murinum_,\r\n_Avena pratensis_, &c., very hard and leathery (_coriaceous_) in\r\n_Psamma_, _Nardus_, species of _Festuca_, _Aira_, _Agropyrum junceum_,\r\n_Elymus_, &c. In aquatic grasses like _Glyceria_, the leaf is almost\r\nspongy owing to the large air-chambers developed in the tissues. These\r\nare easily visible with a lens.\r\n\r\nThe _apex_ is in most cases slender and tapering--_acuminate_; but\r\nin some it is merely brought to a point (_acute_) as in _Catabrosa_,\r\n_Glyceria_ and several species of _Poa_ and _Avena_, &c., usually\r\nflat, but somewhat hooded or curved up in some Poas. In cases where\r\nthe leaves are _setaceous_ or _subulate_, the apex is like a thin\r\ntapering bristle, and even flatter leaves may be so inrolled at the\r\ntips as to have the apex prolonged into a sharp needle-like _pungent_\r\nor _spinescent_ point--e.g. _Hordeum pratense_, _Avena pratensis_ to\r\na slight extent, and pronounced in _Elymus_, &c. In _Sesleria_ the\r\napex is rounded with a short, sharp, prickle-like median projection\r\n(_mucronate_).\r\n\r\nThe passage of blade into sheath has already been described, but\r\nthe base of the blade may have its margins projecting as horizontal\r\nshelves, like a Byron collar, round the sides of the throat of\r\nthe sheath, sometimes tinged with yellow or pink--e.g. _Lolium_,\r\n_Holcus_, _Bromus inermis_, _Hordeum_; the ends of these may project\r\nas _auricles_ or ears--e.g. _Festuca elatior_, _Elymus_, _Agropyrum_,\r\n_Anthoxanthum_, _Bromus asper_, _Hordeum_, &c. In _Festuca ovina_ the\r\nears are short, stiff, and erect (Fig. 13).\r\n\r\nThe margin may be perfectly even, as in most grasses, or it is more\r\nor less _scabrid_ or _scaberulous_, as in _Aira cæspitosa_, _Poa\r\nmaritima_, _Festuca elatior_, _Avena pratensis_, _Agrostis_, _Milium_,\r\n_Phleum_, _Briza_, the minute teeth (_serrulæ_) pointing up or down.\r\n\r\nThe surface may be bright green, or glaucous, harsh, hairy or glabrous,\r\nand is not uncommonly also _scabrid_, like a file or emery-paper, and\r\nsometimes only when rubbed in one direction up or down, owing to the\r\nminute teeth being directed all one way. These teeth are developed on\r\nthe ridges.\r\n\r\nAll our ordinary grass leaves are parallel-veined, and the vascular\r\nstrands (the veins) can usually be seen on holding the leaf up to the\r\nlight. In most cases the tissue is raised over the veins, as ridges or\r\n“ribs,” and according to the height of these ridges the thinner parts\r\nbetween look like deep or shallow furrows (cf. Figs. 8-16 and Chapter\r\nIV.). If the leaf is held up to the light the ridges appear _dark_ in\r\nproportion to their opacity--i.e. height or thickness--and the furrows\r\n_light_ in proportion to the thinness of the tissues there. If the\r\ncontrast is very great, as in _Aira cæspitosa_ (Fig. 23), the furrows\r\nseem like transparent sharp lines, and when, as in _Poa_, which is\r\npractically devoid of ridges, the difference of thickness is small they\r\nappear merely as fine striæ. These characters must be determined on\r\nthe fresh leaves, however, because the contraction in drying draws the\r\nridges closer together and tends to obliterate the lines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. _Digraphis arundinacea._ Transverse section of\r\nmid-rib and half the leaf (× about 6).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. _Holcus lanatus._ Transverse section of\r\nleaf-blade (× 10).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. _Cynosurus cristatus._ Transverse section of\r\nthe leaf-blade (× 20). Stebler.]\r\n\r\nThe ridges are almost always evident--_Catabrosa_, _Poa_, and _Avena_\r\nfurnishing the chief exceptions--and are nearly invariably on the\r\nupper surface: they are below in _Melica_, however; and their\r\nrelative numbers, heights and breadths, section--acute, rounded, or\r\nflattened--furnish valuable characters; as also does the coexistence or\r\nabsence of hairs, asperities, &c.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. Transverse section of the leaf of _Festuca\r\nelatior_, var. _pratensis_ (× 12).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. Ditto of the leaf of _F. ovina_ (× 15).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. Ditto of the leaf of _F. ovina_, var. _rubra_\r\n(× 35).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20. _Festuca ovina_, var. _rubra_. Transverse\r\nsection of the blade of an upper leaf (× 35). Stebler.]\r\n\r\nA very interesting anatomical adaptation is met with in the leaves of\r\nmany grasses which grow in dry situations (xerophytes) such as on sandy\r\nsea-shores, exposed mountains and so forth. When the air is moist, in\r\nwet weather or in the dews, and the sun’s rays not too powerful, the\r\nleaf is spread out with its upper surface flat or nearly so, but when\r\nthe scorching sun and dry air or winds prevail, the leaves fold or\r\nroll up, with the upper sides apposed or overlapping inside the hollow\r\ncylinder thus made.\r\n\r\nIn such leaves some of the upper epidermal cells, either next the\r\nmid-rib (_Sesleria_ &c.) or between the other ribs (_Festuca_ &c.)\r\nare large and very thin-walled, full of sap when distended, and so\r\nplaced that as they lose water by evaporation they contract, and\r\nso draw together the two halves of the lamina (_Sesleria_) or each\r\nribbed segment (_Festuca_), thus causing the infolding or inrolling\r\n(see Chapter IV). Not only from the structure and actions of these\r\nmotor-cells, but also from the fact that the stomata are on the upper\r\nsurfaces and thus protected, and that the lower surfaces which alone\r\nare exposed to the drought are defended by hard and impenetrable\r\ntissues, we must look upon these as adaptations to the xerophytic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaves prominently ridged.\r\n\r\n  _Elymus._\r\n  _Psamma._\r\n  _Aira cæspitosa._\r\n  _Lolium._\r\n  _Cynosurus_ (Fig. 16).\r\n  _Agrostis._\r\n  _Alopecurus._\r\n  _Glyceria fluitans._\r\n  _Kœleria._\r\n  _Festuca elatior._\r\n  _Festuca Myurus_ (var. _sciuroides_).\r\n  _Melica_ has ridges on the _lower_ surface.\r\n\r\nRidges are less prominent in _Phleum pratense_, _Briza_, _Agropyrum_,\r\n_Triodia_, _Arrhenatherum avenaceum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeaves practically devoid of ridges.\r\n\r\n  _Poa_--all common species.\r\n  _Glyceria aquatica._\r\n  _Catabrosa aquatica._\r\n  _Avena pratensis._\r\n\r\nIn some grasses the tissue over the mid-rib is considerably raised and\r\nstrengthened on the dorsal side of the blade as a “keel.”\r\n\r\n\r\nKeel more or less prominent.\r\n\r\n  _Arrhenatherum_ (sheath keeled).\r\n  _Poa_ (all except _P. maritima_).\r\n  _Dactylis._\r\n  _Bromus._\r\n  _Bromus asper_ (sheath keeled, often a white line).\r\n  _Holcus lanatus_ (slight and decurrent) (Fig. 15).\r\n  _Digraphis_ (Fig. 14).\r\n  _Glyceria._\r\n\r\nMost grasses are glabrous, but there are a number in which hairs are\r\nnearly always a prominent feature. It must be remarked, however, that\r\nwith grasses, as with other plants, the character of pubescence is apt\r\nto vary with the situation. In general it may be stated that a hairy\r\ngrass tends to become more glabrous in a moist situation, and more\r\npubescent in a dry one, but the rule is by no means absolute. In some\r\ncases,--e.g. _Avena pubescens_, _A. flavescens_, _Agropyrum_, the hairs\r\nare almost entirely confined to the crests of the ridges (Figs. 10,\r\n15). The following is a list of hairy grasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nHAIRY GRASSES.\r\n\r\n  _Holcus_ (Fig. 15).\r\n  _Molinia cærulea._\r\n  _Brachypodium sylvaticum._\r\n  _Agropyrum_ (variable).\r\n  _Bromus asper._\r\n  _B. mollis._\r\n  _Hordeum._\r\n  _Anthoxanthum._\r\n  _Avena flavescens_ (Fig. 10).\r\n  _A. pubescens._\r\n  _Triodia._\r\n  _Kœleria._\r\n\r\n\r\nTo a less extent.\r\n\r\n  _Festuca sciuroides_ (on ribs).\r\n  _Melica._\r\n\r\nGrasses as a rule are devoid of strong scents[5] or tastes, but\r\n_Anthoxanthum_ has a faint but distinct sweet odour, especially as\r\nit dries--it is one of the grasses which give the scent to new-mown\r\nhay--and a bitter flavour, and _Milium_, _Hierochloe_ and _Holcus_ are\r\nalso more or less bitter. _Spartina stricta_ emits a strong unpleasant\r\nodour.\r\n\r\nThe habitat of grasses is of great importance as an aid to\r\ndetermination. No one would expect to find a sea-shore grass growing in\r\na beech-forest, or an aquatic grass on a dry chalk-down; but they are\r\neven more true to their habitats than this, and I append the following\r\nlists of habitats of British grasses as of use in determining them,\r\nthough it is not pretended that the limits are absolute.\r\n\r\nIn the following list “pasture-grass” (P) means useful for grazing, and\r\n“meadow-grass” (M) one that is especially valuable for mowing--i.e. for\r\nhay.

whether a grass is rare or local,\r\nespecially for the purpose we have in view, and I have therefore drawn\r\nup the following list of rare, local or introduced foreign grasses\r\neither not noticed at all, or only referred to incidentally in this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn many cases these introduced foreign grasses have sprung up from\r\nseeds brought over in cargoes of hay, wool, and other products and\r\npacking materials, which in part accounts for their occurrence only\r\nnear certain sea-ports, manufacturing towns and so forth. Such\r\nplants are frequently termed ballast plants. Foreign plants are also\r\nintroduced in seed, as mixtures or impurities, and frequently escape\r\nfrom corn-fields &c.\r\n\r\n  _Leersia oryzoides_ (ditches of Hants., Sussex and Surrey).\r\n  _Panicum sanguinale_ (S. England).\r\n  _P. verticillatum_ (fields in S. and E.).\r\n  _P. glaucum_ (rarely introduced).\r\n  _Hierochloe borealis_ (Thurso only).\r\n  _Phleum alpinum_ (Highlands only).\r\n  _P. Bœhmeri_ (Eastern counties, rare).\r\n  _P. asperum_     ”       ”       ”\r\n  _Phalaris canariensis_ (rare weed).\r\n  _Alopecurus alpinus_ (Highlands).\r\n  _Mibora verna_ (Anglesea and Channel Islands).\r\n  _Lagurus ovatus_ (Suffolk coasts).\r\n  _Polypogon monspeliensis_ (rare, in S. England near sea).\r\n  _P. littoralis_ (salt marshes S. England).\r\n  _Agrostis setacea_ (dry heaths of S. Wales).\r\n  _A. Spica-venti_ (sandy fields of E. counties).\r\n  _Gastridium lendigerum_ (fields and waste places in S. Wales\r\n    and Norfolk).\r\n  _Calamagrostis Epigeios_ (moist glades &c. in Scotland).\r\n  _C. lanceolata_ (moist shades, scattered in England).\r\n  _C. stricta_ (bogs, &c., very rare).\r\n  _Cynodon Dactylon_ (waste and cultivated lands near sea in Scotland).\r\n  _Spartina stricta_ (salt marshes S. and E. coast).\r\n  _Lepturus incurvatus_ (scattered on shores).\r\n  _Bromus maximus_ (Jersey).\r\n  _B. madritensis_ (roads and waste, Scotland and Tipperary).\r\n  _B. inermis_ (introduced from Hungary).\r\n  _Lolium italicum_ (introduced from Lombardy).\r\n  _Festuca uniglumis_ (Irish and S.E. coast).\r\n  _Poa procumbens_ (waste ground near sea).\r\n  _P. loliacea_ (sandy sea-shores).\r\n  _P. laxa_ (Ben Nevis, &c.).\r\n  _P. alpina_ (Highlands and N.).\r\n  _Catabrosa aquatica_ (shallow pools and ditches, scattered).\r\n\r\nFinally, a few words may be said on a subject still in its\r\ninfancy--that of Indicator-plants. In many cases certain plants are\r\nfound so confined to certain classes of soil, that foresters and\r\nagriculturists have claimed to be able to infer from their presence\r\nthe presence or absence of certain chemical or other constituents of\r\nsoils: on the contrary we find other plants so universally distributed\r\nwithout reference to the quality of the soil, that they are not\r\nindicative. The latter are often termed _ruderal_ or _vagabonds_ (see\r\np. 29). Without attempting too rigid a classification of Grasses in\r\nthis connection--which would be premature in this early state of our\r\nknowledge--the following remarks are at least generally true.\r\n\r\nA few grasses are Indicators of chalk and limestone--e.g. _Briza\r\nmedia_, _Kœleria cristata_, and the exotic species _Stipa pennata_\r\nand _Melica ciliata_.\r\n\r\nThe following are said to indicate a sufficiency of potassium salts,\r\n\r\n\r\nIn moister soils.\r\n\r\n  _Digraphis arundinacea._\r\n  _Phleum pratense._\r\n  _Avena pubescens._\r\n  _Arundo Phragmites._\r\n  _Molinia cærulea._\r\n  _Glyceria fluitans._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn drier soils.\r\n\r\n  _Anthoxanthum odoratum._\r\n  _Alopecurus pratensis._\r\n  _Agrostis alba._\r\n  __Holcus lanatus.__\r\n  _Arrhenatherum._\r\n  _Kœleria cristata._\r\n  _Briza media._\r\n  _Dactylis glomerata._\r\n  _Cynosurus cristatus._\r\n  _Poa pratensis._\r\n  _P. trivialis._\r\n  _P. compressa._\r\n  _Festuca elatior._\r\n  _Lolium perenne._\r\n\r\nGrasses like _Bromus arvensis_ indicate the existence of clay in the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\nWhile the following are indicative of sand,\r\n\r\n  _Aira caryophyllea._\r\n  _A. præcox._\r\n  _A. canescens._\r\n  _Festuca ovina._\r\n  _Bromus sterilis._\r\n\r\nAnd only if the sandy soil is moist and of better quality, owing to a\r\ncertain proportion of humus, the following,\r\n\r\n  _Anthoxanthum odoratum._\r\n  _Agrostis alba._\r\n  _Dactylis glomerata._\r\n  _Arrhenatherum avenaceum._\r\n  _Avena pubescens._\r\n  _Poa pratensis._\r\n\r\nThat the soil contains considerable quantities of common salt--sodium\r\nchloride--may be inferred if the following grasses occur,\r\n\r\n  _Psamma arenaria._\r\n  _Elymus arenarius._\r\n  _Hordeum maritimum._\r\n  _Agropyrum junceum_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe existence of much humus is indicated by such shade grasses as\r\n\r\n  _Melica uniflora._\r\n  _M. nutans._\r\n  _Milium effusum._\r\n  _Bromus giganteus._\r\n  _B. asper._\r\n  _Brachypodium sylvaticum._\r\n\r\nWhereas soils known as “sour,” though containing much vegetable\r\nremains, may be suspected if the following grasses abound on them,\r\n\r\n  _Aira cæspitosa._\r\n  _Nardus stricta._\r\n  _Alopecurus geniculatus._\r\n  _Molinia cærulea_;\r\n\r\nespecially if sedges and rushes coexist with them.\r\n\r\nWhen cuttings are made in forests, such grasses as the following are\r\nvery apt to appear, and may do harm to young plants,\r\n\r\n  _Festuca ovina_ and varieties.\r\n  _Agrostis alba._\r\n  _Holcus mollis._\r\n  _Aira flexuosa_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe grasses more especially indicative of particular classes of\r\nforest-soils are chiefly the wood-species (see p. 28), and need not be\r\nfurther specified. In gaps, borders, and copses--half-shade--we find\r\nseveral common grasses--e.g.\r\n\r\n  _Anthoxanthum odoratum._\r\n  _Agrostis alba._\r\n  _Aira flexuosa._\r\n  _Holcus lanatus._\r\n  _Arrhenatherum avenaceum._\r\n  _Triodia decumbens._\r\n  _Dactylis glomerata._\r\n  _Festuca rubra._\r\n  _Brachypodium pinnatum._\r\n  _Hordeum sylvaticum._\r\n\r\nWhereas\r\n\r\n  _Poa nemoralis_,\r\n  _Festuca sylvatica_,\r\n  _Agropyrum caninum_,\r\n  _Melica_,\r\n  _Milium_,\r\n  _Bromus asper_,\r\n  _B. giganteus_,\r\n  _Brachypodium sylvaticum_,\r\n\r\nare more likely to be met with in the deep shade inside the forest.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand there are vagabond grasses which seem to show no\r\nsigns of preference for one soil over another--e.g. _Poa annua_--though\r\nin some cases these _ruderal_ plants indicate the presence of rotting\r\nsubstances, on ash-heaps and rubbish of various kinds.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the above, however, the student must not forget\r\nthat very complex relations are concerned in changes of soil, shade,\r\nmoisture, elevation, &c. and that although experienced observers can\r\ndraw conclusions of some value from the presence of _numerous species\r\nand individuals_ on a given soil, no one must conclude too readily that\r\na soil is so and so, from observing solely that a particular kind of\r\ngrass will grow there.\r\n\r\nAn excellent example of what may be done by applying such knowledge\r\nas exists of the habits of grasses, is afforded by the historic case\r\nof the planting up of shifting sand-dunes with species like _Psamma\r\narenaria_, _Elymus arenarius_, _Agropyrum junceum_, &c. (together\r\nwith sand-binding species of sedges) and so not only fixing the sand,\r\nbut preparing it for gradual afforestation with bushes and eventually\r\ntrees, and so saving enormous tracts of land and sums of money, as has\r\nbeen done on the West coasts of France.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the action of ruderal plants--including grasses--is to\r\ncompletely alter the nature of the poor soil and gradually fit it for\r\nother plants. Coverings of grass greatly affect the actions of heat and\r\nsunshine on the surface soil, and modify the effects of radiation and\r\nevaporation, to say nothing of the penetrating and other effects of the\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nRhizomes and stolons break up stiff soils; and every engineer\r\nand forester knows how useful certain grasses are in keeping the\r\nsurface-soil from being washed down by heavy rains on steep hill-sides\r\nor embankments.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, luxuriant growths of tall grasses may do harm to\r\nyoung plants, by their action as weeds and especially as shade-plants;\r\nthough foresters can employ them in the latter capacity, under\r\nrestrictions, to shelter young trees from the sun. Again, too much dry\r\ngrass near a forest offers dangers from fire; and it is a well known\r\nfact that certain injurious animals, e.g. mice and other vermin, are\r\nfavoured by a covering of grass.\r\n\r\nGraminaceæ are for the most part chalk-fleeing plants, in spite of the\r\nfact that certain species can grow in very thin layers of soil on chalk\r\ndowns. They must be regarded as requiring moderate supplies of humus as\r\na rule, and even sand-loving grasses are not real exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe physiognomy of the grasses has always been regarded as a striking\r\none, and Humboldt classed it as one of his 19 types of vegetation.\r\nAs is well known they are sociable plants, often covering enormous\r\nareas--prairies, alps, steppes, &c.--with a few species, alone or\r\ndensely scattered throughout a mixed herbage. They also represent\r\ncharacteristically the sun-plants, the erect leaves exposing their\r\nsurfaces obliquely to the solar rays, and being often folded and nearly\r\nalways narrow.\r\n\r\nThe dead remains of these sociable grasses are an important factor in\r\nprotecting the soil against drought and in facilitating humification,\r\nas well as in covering up plants during long winters or dry seasons,\r\nkeeping the ground warmer and moister, and generally lessening the\r\neffect of extremes.\r\n\r\nMany Graminaceæ are pronounced xerophytes, the epidermis often being\r\ndeveloped as a water-storing tissue, while the erect leaves roll\r\nthemselves in intense light, the stomata being situated accordingly.\r\nThe halophytic strand-plants _Psamma arenaria_, _Elymus arenarius_,\r\n_Agropyrum junceum_, and other Dune-species, as well as species of\r\n_Aira_, _Festuca_, _Anthoxanthum_, _Stipa_, _Lygeum_, _Aristida_,\r\n&c. are examples. The heath-grasses--e.g. _Festuca ovina_, _Nardus\r\nstricta_, _Molinia cærulea_--also come under this category.\r\n\r\nMany of the strand-plants (halophytes) _Agropyrum_, _Psamma_, _Elymus_,\r\nare covered with waxy bloom, and have long rhizomes which bind the sand\r\nand form new soil, a property largely taken advantage of in certain\r\nforest operations.\r\n\r\nOther grasses, particularly annual species, show their adaptation to\r\nxerophytic habits by forming bulbous store-houses at the base of the\r\nculms--e.g. _Phleum arenarium_.\r\n\r\nSome Graminaceæ are hydrophytes, such as _Arundo_, _Glyceria_,\r\n&c., with large intercellular spaces in their tissues; while\r\nmany species--e.g. _Aira cæspitosa_, _Agrostis canina_, _Molinia\r\ncærulea_--grow on wet moor-lands, forming perennial tufts, with or\r\nwithout creeping rhizomes.\r\n\r\nThe mesophyte grasses are especially characteristic of what may be\r\ntermed carpets--a lawn is a good example on a small scale, though of\r\ncourse we must remember that here the struggle for existence has been\r\nartificially interfered with more or less. Such carpets consist of the\r\ndensely interwoven rootlets and rhizomes forming sod, and contain much\r\nhumus from the accumulated débris of former years. These grass-carpets\r\nmay be composed of nearly pure growths of a few species, or of very\r\nmany different grasses and other herbage. They are common in Arctic\r\nregions, on Alps, and in temperate climates generally, where we know\r\nthem as meadows, hay-fields, pasture and lawns.\r\n\r\nThe Bamboos in the wider sense have a physiognomy of their own, e.g. in\r\nIndia, and may drive out most other plants and form dense undergrowths\r\nor jungle of interlaced stems and leaves and thorny shoots. Similar\r\ngrowths occur on the Andes and elsewhere in South America. In some\r\nparts of India and tropical Asia the taller bamboos form aggregates\r\ncomparable to dense forests, and such forests are common on the\r\nbanks of several large tropical rivers. Most of these Bamboos are\r\nxerophytes. Bamboos are neither confined to the tropics, nor to\r\nwarmer regions, however, for species are known from distinctly cool\r\nregions--e.g. South America--or even from near the snow line--e.g.\r\nChili, the Himalayas, Japan, &c., and the number of species known as\r\nhardy is increasing annually, as is evident on examining our larger\r\nEnglish gardens.\r\n\r\nThe permanence and character of extensive grasslands, especially\r\nprairies, savannahs, and steppes, are much affected by the periodical\r\nfiring they are exposed to in the dry season, and large tracts of\r\ncountry in various parts of the world would doubtless bear forests or\r\nother vegetation if not thus fired, while in other cases the herbage\r\nwould be differently constituted were firing discontinued.\r\n\r\nThe following chapter embodies an attempt to classify our British\r\ngrasses solely for purposes of identification when not in flower. It\r\nis not claimed that the arrangement is the best possible, nor that it\r\nis complete, and I need hardly say that corrections will be gratefully\r\nreceived.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nGRASSES CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THEIR VEGETATIVE CHARACTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. SHEATHS ENTIRE EXCEPT WHERE THOSE OF LOWER LEAVES ARE BURST BY\r\nBRANCHES, &C.\r\n\r\n  +A. Aquatics with the sheaths reticulated, owing to large\r\n      air-cavities. Leaves equitant, linear acute, often\r\n      floating.+\r\n\r\n_Glyceria fluitans_ (Br.). Floating sweet grass. Somewhat coarse, but\r\nuseful pasture in water-meadows and fens. Sweet-tasting.\r\n\r\nSection of sheathed leaves linear oblong; sheath striate or furrowed,\r\nkeeled; leaf ribbed; ligule broad acute. Leaf-base with a yellow\r\ntriangle. Smooth.\r\n\r\n_Glyceria aquatica_ (Sm.). Reed sweet grass. Especially given to\r\ngrowing in the water-courses and on banks instead of spreading in the\r\nwater-meadows, &c. Sweet-tasting.\r\n\r\nSection of sheathed leaves broadly naviculate; sheath smooth, no keel;\r\nleaf not ribbed, thick and inflated with large air-cavities; ligule\r\nshort. Leaf-base with a brown triangle. Margins and keel rather rough.\r\n\r\n  These two species of _Glyceria_ are distinguished by their\r\n  shoot-sections and the ridges of the leaves of _G. fluitans_: they\r\n  often occur in the same ditch.\r\n\r\n  They cannot readily be confused with others on account of their\r\n  aquatic habit, and the characters given. The only other aquatic\r\n  or semi-aquatic species are forms of _Catabrosa_, _Digraphis_,\r\n  _Arundo_, _Alopecurus geniculatus_, _Molinia cærulea_ and the rare\r\n  _Calamagrostis_.\r\n\r\n  The ligule and flat shoots with closed sheaths alone suffice to\r\n  distinguish it from the round and split sheathed _Arundo Phragmites_;\r\n  and the round shoots of _Digraphis_, its split sheath and firm\r\n  leaves, suffice to distinguish it.\r\n\r\n  _Molinia_ also has a tuft of hairs instead of a ligule, and a split\r\n  sheath, and its habit is different.\r\n\r\n  _Alopecurus geniculatus_, with its “kneed” shoots, has a totally\r\n  different habit from _Glyceria_, and its very high ridges and want of\r\n  visible air-chambers complete the diagnosis.\r\n\r\n  _Catabrosa_ is a small creeping aquatic with very flaccid leaves,\r\n  quite glabrous and soft. Also sweet-tasting.\r\n\r\n  +B. Not aquatic, and devoid of visible air-chambers in leaf or\r\n      sheath. Often perennial, i.e. having stolons or other branches\r\n      with no rudiments of flowers in them, and with relics of old\r\n      leaf-bases.+\r\n\r\n    (α) Sections of sheathed leaves acute: either two-edged or\r\n        four-edged.\r\n\r\n      (1) Section of sheathed leaves quadrangular. Blades of leaf thin\r\n          and dry, sparsely hairy. Sheath quite entire. Woods and shady\r\n          places.\r\n\r\n_Melica uniflora_, L. (Wood Melick). Lamina slightly tapered below,\r\nconvolute. Ligule obsolete, with a stiff subulate process on the sheath\r\nopposite the blade-insertion. Ridges below, but not above.\r\n\r\n_Melica nutans_, L. (Mountain Melick). Ligule longer, and without the\r\nawl-shaped peg. Only in Scotland and W. of England.\r\n\r\n  Both are shade grasses of no agricultural value.\r\n\r\n  _M. uniflora_, with its quadrangular shoots and anti-ligular peg,\r\n  cannot be confounded with any other grass.\r\n\r\n      (2) Sections of sheathed leaves more or less acutely two-edged,\r\n          owing to the keels of the compressed equitant leaves.\r\n\r\n        (i) _Shoots broad and fan-like, much compressed, with old\r\n            brown leaf-sheaths below, sometimes burst by the\r\n            intra-vaginal branches: leaf ridgeless, with prominent\r\n            keel. No underground stolons._\r\n\r\n_Dactylis glomerata_, L. (Cock’s-foot). An early and quick-growing\r\npasture-grass, which forms much aftermath. Grows on all soils. Often\r\ncoarse. Coarse tussocks, and harsh, with broad thick succulent\r\nbluish-green leaves.\r\n\r\nSection of sheathed leaves acutely naviculate. Prominent obtuse ligule,\r\ntorn above. Lamina long, rough, acute, with white lines if held up, and\r\nserrulate edges. No flanking lines[6]. No stolons (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\n  There is a cultivated variety of _Dactylis_ with broad opaque\r\n  white stripes down the leaves: these are totally different\r\n  from the translucent white stripes seen on holding the wild\r\n  form, or _Aira cæspitosa_, up to the light. Another cultivated\r\n  “ribbon-grass”--_Digraphis_--has _round_ shoots, _split_ sheaths, and\r\n  a different habit, and the same applies to its wild form.\r\n\r\n  Probably the only serious chances of confusion with _Dactylis_ are\r\n  between it and _Poa pratensis_, which also has flattened shoots\r\n  and closed sheath; but in the latter the section of the shoot is\r\n  _elliptical_--not _naviculate_,--the keel is far less prominent, and\r\n  the ligule shorter. Moreover _P. pratensis_ is a creeping\r\n  stoloniferous grass, less harsh, and with less pointed leaves.\r\n\r\n  The distance to which the sheath is torn may be from 1/8 to 1/2 down.\r\n  Leaves tend to remain conduplicate. Margins serrulate with teeth\r\n  extremely short and directed forwards.\r\n\r\n        (ii) _Shoots compressed but narrow: the section almost\r\n            rhomboid with rounded edges._\r\n\r\n_Poa trivialis_, L. (Rough-stalked Meadow-grass). Conspicuous in deep\r\nrich pastures and orchards, preferring slight shade and rich soil.\r\nValuable pasture and hay grass.\r\n\r\nRootstock shortly creeping, branches extra-vaginal and above ground,\r\nshoots rough. Blade narrow, harsh, with an acute point, thin, shining\r\nbelow, ridgeless, with flanking lines and keel. Ligule acute, and short\r\nor long (Fig. 8).\r\n\r\n_Sesleria cærulea_, Ard. (Blue Moor-grass), of our northern limestone\r\nhills, has narrow, flat, glaucous blue, stiff, mucronate leaves, with\r\nscabrid apex. Ligule ciliate.\r\n\r\n  _Poa trivialis_ is most likely to be confounded with other Poas,\r\n  especially _P. annua_ and _P. pratensis_, since they both have thin\r\n  leaves and flat shoots; but _P. annua_ has a split sheath, less acute\r\n  and duller leaves, is annual, and less harsh, and the shoot-section is\r\n  flatter at the sides and rounder at the ends.\r\n\r\n  _Poa pratensis_, L. is larger and more stoloniferous, with both\r\n  extra- and intra-vaginal branches, culms erect and smooth, sheaths\r\n  smooth, and the shoot-sections elliptical--not cornered or\r\n  rhomboidal--and with darker green and larger, thicker, 7-veined,\r\n  more glossy, and less harsh leaves, with shorter, blunter ligule.\r\n\r\n  _Poa compressa_, L. also presents difficulties, but the sheath is\r\n  split, and the ligule is shorter than in _P. trivialis_, the leaves\r\n  thicker, and the shoot-sections more linear-oblong or elliptical.\r\n\r\n\r\n    (β) Sections of sheathed leaves rounded, circular or oval,\r\n        there being no prominent keels.\r\n\r\n      (1) Section of sheathed leaves circular or nearly so, the shoots\r\n          being only slightly compressed.\r\n\r\n        * _Perennial._\r\n\r\n_Bromus inermis_ (Awnless Brome).\r\n\r\nSections circular, the leaves being convolute, base shelving. Glabrous\r\nsheaths and leaves. Stoloniferous. Ligule short, truncate, and finely\r\ntoothed. A forage grass of the Hungarian steppes. Now being grown in\r\nthis country, but of doubtful value here.\r\n\r\n_Bromus erectus_, Huds. (Upright Brome). A weed.\r\n\r\nSections oval and rounded, but leaves equitant. Radical leaves remain\r\nfolded and almost subulate, hairy edges. No stolons. Fields, &c. It is\r\na weed on dry lands, and of little or no value.\r\n\r\n_Bromus asper_, Murr. (Hairy Brome). In thickets, &c.: a weed, and\r\nuseless. Leaves green, long, flat, hanging, and eared. Sheath with\r\nscattered deflexed hairs. Lamina tapering at the base. Keel a white\r\nline, ridges inconspicuous: distance between veins 2-3 times breadth of\r\nlatter. Ligule very short, toothed.\r\n\r\n_B. giganteus_, L. (Tall Brome), also comes here. It is less common and\r\nglabrous. Woods, &c., a useless weed.\r\n\r\n        ** _Annual or biennial._\r\n\r\n_Bromus mollis_ (_B. arvensis_, var. _mollis_, L.), Field Brome. A\r\ntoo abundant and useless weed in water-meadows and hay-fields. Softly\r\ndowny. Blades very thin and not eared: dry.\r\n\r\n_Bromus sterilis_, L. (Barren Brome). A useless weed. Rough and downy,\r\nbut less so than the last. Moist waysides, &c.\r\n\r\n  The Bromes are extremely variable and difficult to determine by the\r\n  leaves. The annual species are apt to be biennial or (_B. sterilis_)\r\n  perennial; and some vary much as regards hairiness--e.g. _B. mollis_\r\n  is connected by a series of semi-glabrous forms to varieties quite\r\n  smooth, all grouped by Bentham under _B. arvensis_.\r\n\r\n  _Bromus asper_, being auriculate and a shade-species, runs some risk\r\n  of confusion with _Hordeum sylvaticum_, but _Hordeum_ has a _split_\r\n  sheath and in _B. asper_ the translucent interspace between the\r\n  ridges is 2-3 times as broad as in _Hordeum sylvaticum_.\r\n\r\n  The other species of _Bromus_ are not eared, and their entire sheaths\r\n  at once distinguish them from _Hordeum_.\r\n\r\n  _Bromus giganteus_ has leaves glabrous and very like _Festuca\r\n  elatior_. The red split sheaths of the latter, its sharp ears and\r\n  prominent ridges afford the best distinctions; and _B. giganteus_ has\r\n  broader leaves and more evident serrulation or descending bristles at\r\n  the basal margins.\r\n\r\n      (2) Section of sheathed leaves elliptical, owing to the shoots\r\n          being compressed. Sheaths often only slightly split above.\r\n          No hair on surface of leaves or sheaths.\r\n\r\n        ✲ _Margins of leaves smooth and even. Blades without ridges,\r\n           a keel and flanking lines, acute, base rounded. Ligule of\r\n           lower leaves very short._\r\n\r\n_Poa pratensis_, L. (Smooth-stalked Meadow-grass). An early and\r\nvaluable dry pasture-grass, but though deep-rooted, it yields thin\r\nhay: its chief value is for “bottom grass” and in lawn mixtures, &c.\r\nLeaves stiff and pointed. Extra-vaginal rooting underground stolons,\r\nand intra-vaginal branches. Shoots smooth. Keel slight: seven principal\r\nveins and smaller ones between. Leaves blunter and broader than in _P.\r\ntrivialis_.\r\n\r\n_Poa alpina_, L. (Alpine Poa). On mountains in the north. No stolons.\r\n4-5 veins on each side of the median one.\r\n\r\n  _Poa pratensis_ presents similar difficulties to _P. trivialis_: for\r\n  diagnoses see p. 42. It is distinguished from _P. nemoralis_ by its\r\n  closed sheath, thicker, blunter and harder leaves, linear-elliptical\r\n  shoot-sections, and light coloured nodes, as well as by its habit.\r\n  All other Poas have shallow and poorly developed roots.\r\n\r\n  _P. fertilis_ is a form very like _P. nemoralis_, with rougher leaves\r\n  and longer ligule, introduced into cultivation.\r\n\r\n        ✲✲ _Margins of leaves scaberulous with descending hairs.\r\n             Very low flat ridges. Sheath smooth._\r\n\r\n_Briza media_, L. (Quaking Grass). A weed in meadows, indicating poor\r\nsoil--e.g. moor-lands and chalk--but eaten by sheep. Tufted and slightly\r\ncreeping perennial. Ligules very short, entire.\r\n\r\n_Briza minor_, L. (Lesser Quaking-grass). Annual. Leaves broader and\r\nshorter, and ligules longer. In the south and rarer.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. SHEATHS SPLIT, AT LEAST SOME DISTANCE DOWN.\r\n\r\n  +A. Glabrous--i.e. with no obvious hairs[7].+\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Grasses with setaceous or bristle-like leaves;--i.e. the\r\n          lamina of the lower leaves remains permanently folded instead\r\n          of opening out flat.\r\n\r\n      (1) Ligule obsolete, auricled at the junction of blade and sheath.\r\n\r\n_Festuca ovina_ (Sheep’s Fescue). Densely tufted perennial. Leaves\r\nhard, glabrous and often glaucous, with 5-7 ridges if forcibly\r\nunrolled, ears short, stiff and erect. Branches in permanent sheaths.\r\nChiefly useful as pastures on downs and dry chalk-soils. Several\r\nvarieties are recognised by agriculturists, as hard, red,\r\nvarious-leafed, fine-leafed Fescue, &c. (see Figs. 13 and 18).\r\n\r\n_Festuca Myurus_, L. (Rat’s-tail Fescue). Annual, longer auricles, and\r\nhair on the ribbed inrolled surface. A road-side weed.\r\n\r\n  _Festuca ovina_ presents difficulties with its varieties and with _F.\r\n  Myurus_, L. (var. _sciuroides_, Roth.).\r\n\r\n  The chief varieties of _F. ovina_ are Hard Fescue (_F. duriuscula_,\r\n  L.), taller and with some of the upper leaves flat, and found in\r\n  moister and rich soils: Red Fescue (_F. sabulicola_, Duf. or _F.\r\n  rubra_, L.) more or less creeping and with red sheaths to the lower\r\n  leaves, on poor stony land--_F. heterophylla_ is a form of this on\r\n  chalky soils, with flat leaves above: and _F. tenuifolia_ a very wiry\r\n  form on sheep-lands. They all pass into one another, however, and\r\n  cannot be distinguished by the leaves (see Figs. 18-20).\r\n\r\n  _F. Myurus_ (var. _sciuroides_) is ruderal and annual, and has longer\r\n  hairs on the ridges of the folded leaves. It has no agricultural\r\n  value.\r\n\r\n      (2) Ligule membranous, not auricled.\r\n\r\n        (α) _Bristle-like (setaceous) leaves, very hard and stiff,\r\n            and more or less solid._\r\n\r\n_Nardus stricta_, L. (Moor Mat-grass). Roots very tough and stringy:\r\nligule small, but thick and blunt. Leaves channelled: upper erect,\r\nlower horizontal. Sheath smooth. Moors and sandy heaths: useless (Figs.\r\n2 and 26).\r\n\r\n_Aira flexuosa_, L. (Wavy Hair-grass). Roots fibrous. Leaves short,\r\nfiliform, terete, solid--the channel hardly discernible. Ligule short,\r\nobtuse. Heaths, &c. Of little use, even for sheep (Fig. 28).\r\n\r\n        (β) _Leaves bristle-like, but distinctly due to inrolling\r\n            of edges._\r\n\r\n_Aira caryophyllea_, L. (Silvery Hair-grass), is scabrid. A weed, with\r\nvery slight foliage.\r\n\r\n_A. præcox_, L. (Early Hair-grass). Greener and more glabrous. Habit\r\nmore rigid.\r\n\r\n_A. canescens_, L. (Grey Hair-grass). Glaucous or purplish; rare, on\r\nS.E. coasts.\r\n\r\n        (γ) _Leaves narrow and more or less involute, and subulate\r\n            upwards, but easily unrolled, and apt to become flatter\r\n            as they age._\r\n\r\n_Avena pratensis_, L. (Perennial Oat). Leaves rather thin, dry, harsh,\r\nridgeless, with flanking lines and a keel[8]; glaucous, glabrous,\r\nbut edges scabrous. Usually involute, but may open out. Ligule long\r\novate-acute. Dry pastures, especially on calcareous soil, and of little\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\n_Poa maritima_, Huds. (Sea-grass). Leaves narrow, rather short, and\r\nU-shaped in section. Involute: ridgeless, with flanking lines, but no\r\nkeel; soft and rather thick. Ligule rather long, obtuse and decurrent.\r\nUseless agriculturally.\r\n\r\n  For difficulties with other species of _Avena_ and _Poa_ see pp. 44,\r\n  54 and 60.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Grasses with the leaves expanded, more or less flat.\r\n\r\n      (1) Blades conspicuously ridged--i.e. the surface is raised in\r\n          prominent longitudinal ridges with furrows between.\r\n\r\n        (i) _Leaves rigid and hard, sharp pointed. Sheath and outer\r\n             leaf-surface usually glabrous._\r\n\r\n_Aira cæspitosa_, L. (Tufted Hair-grass). Forms large tufts. A coarse\r\nweed forming bad tussocks in wet meadows and pastures: useless for\r\nfodder. Leaves flat. Ligule long, acute. Ridges equal, high and sharp,\r\nand scabrid, with 5-6 white lines between, if viewed by transmitted\r\nlight. Wet meadows.\r\n\r\n  _A. cæspitosa_ cannot easily be mistaken for any other species.\r\n  _Alopecurus geniculatus_ is also a moisture-loving grass with\r\n  strongly ridged leaves, but the interspaces are far less\r\n  translucent and the whole habit is different.\r\n\r\n  All the other species of _Aira_ have involute and setaceous leaves,\r\n  and even _A. cæspitosa_ is apt to roll in its leaves in mountain\r\n  varieties, but they are easily flattened out, and show the ridges.\r\n\r\n_Psamma arenaria_, Beauv. (Sea Mat-grass). This is one of the most\r\nvaluable “sand-binders,” its long matted rhizomes holding loose sand\r\ntogether. It is a sea-shore grass, of no use for fodder. It was\r\nformerly much used for mats and thatching. Leaves concave, long,\r\nnarrow, erect, scabrid and glaucous above, and polished below: pungent.\r\nRidges rounded, alternately high and low. Sheath long. Ligule very long\r\nand bifid.\r\n\r\n_Elymus arenarius_, L. (Sand Lyme-grass). Like _Psamma_, this is a\r\n“sand-binder” and of no use for fodder. Leaves concave, and eared at\r\nthe base of the blade: ears pointed and tend to cross in front. Ligule\r\nvery short and obtuse. Ridges flattened above, not scabrid. Apex of\r\nblade rolled, forming a hard spine.\r\n\r\n  _Psamma_ cannot easily be mistaken for the much less common _Elymus_,\r\n  as it is not eared, and the ridges and ligule are very different.\r\n\r\n        (ii) _Leaves not specially rigid and hard, and often thin;\r\n             glabrous, or shining below. Ridges less evident._\r\n\r\n          * _Ligule very short or obsolete; blade firm but not hard,\r\n            glabrous or nearly so, and shining below. Sheath often\r\n            coloured red or yellow at the base._\r\n\r\n            † _Sections of sheathed leaves narrow, oblong, owing to\r\n              compression of shoots. Sheath nearly entire._\r\n\r\n_Lolium perenne_, L. (Perennial Rye-grass). Very valuable\r\npasture-grass, especially on clay. Less successful as hay. Deep rooted\r\ntufts. Glossy dark green. Ligule short (Fig. 11). Sheath red or\r\npurplish below. Blade conduplicate and keeled, often rounded, collared\r\nor eared at the base; with rounded ridges and rough above, shining\r\nbelow. When the ears are well developed their points often cross one\r\nover the other in front of the sheath.\r\n\r\n_L. italicum_, Braun. (Italian Rye-grass), is an earlier and better\r\nvariety for hay and sewage farms. Shoot more rounded in section, and\r\nhas less marked veins on the more rolled leaf.\r\n\r\n_L. temulentum_, L. (Common Darnel), is annual and a weed of\r\ncorn-fields. Foliage usually rougher.\r\n\r\n  _Lolium perenne_ presents some difficulties in relation to such forms\r\n  as _L. italicum_, species of _Agrostis_ and _Festuca_, _Alopecurus\r\n  pratensis_, _Cynosurus_ and _Agropyrum_.\r\n\r\n  Owing to the leaves not being always strictly conduplicate in the\r\n  first year, the flat shoots may not sharply mark it off from _L.\r\n  italicum_. Its somewhat looser, almost stoloniferous tufts, and\r\n  darker green foliage, less polished below and usually narrower and\r\n  harder, have then to be taken into account.\r\n\r\n  The ridges of _Lolium_ are often like those of _Festuca pratensis_;\r\n  and the shining lower surface and rather firm leaves and red sheaths,\r\n  present other points of confusion. The smooth basal margins of\r\n  _Lolium_, absence of white translucent lines when held up, and\r\n  the different ligule and ears afford distinctions--the ligule of\r\n  _Festuca_ being a mere line, and the ears pointed and projecting,\r\n  whereas they may be mere lateral ledges in _Lolium_.\r\n\r\n  _Cynosurus_ has the ligule and ears very like those of _Lolium_, the\r\n  ears being mere ledges; but the former has yellow sheaths, firmer and\r\n  thicker leaves with more evident ridges, and the old plants usually\r\n  have the characteristic crested spikes remaining. _Cynosurus_,\r\n  moreover, has the sheath split only a short way down.\r\n\r\n  With regard to _Agrostis_, there is no colour in the sheath, the\r\n  ligule is longer and pointed, and the leaves drier and thinner than\r\n  in _Lolium_, and harsher on both surfaces. _Agrostis_ has also no\r\n  ears.\r\n\r\n  _Alopecurus pratensis_ has much broader and flatter ridges than\r\n  _Lolium_ and a longer ligule, and its sheaths are dark-brown or\r\n  black--not red; but _A. agrestis_ has very similar ridges to _Lolium_\r\n  and may easily be confounded at first.\r\n\r\n  _Agropyrum_ is sometimes nearly glabrous, and may then be confused\r\n  with _Lolium_ by beginners: its low ridges, curled and pointed ears,\r\n  obsolete ligule, and thinner, drier, harsher blade, as well as the\r\n  stolons, distinguish it.\r\n\r\n  _Lolium temulentum_ and _Hordeum murinum_ occasionally cause\r\n  difficulty, but the latter is always more or less hairy, its blades\r\n  thinner and drier, and the ridges less raised.\r\n\r\n            †† _Sections rounded--elliptical or nearly circular.\r\n               Sheath distinctly split, at least above._\r\n\r\n_Cynosurus cristatus_, L. (Crested Dog’s-tail). Useful as pasture on\r\ndry soils, but only moderately so as hay. Blade narrow, slightly eared\r\nor collared below, tapered above; firmer than _Lolium_. Sheath only\r\nsplit a short way down. Yellow or yellowish-white at the base. Leaves\r\nconduplicate or convolute, short and narrow, the ligule short: minute\r\nears at base. Usually easily recognised by the withered culms and\r\npersistent pectinate spikes (Fig. 16).\r\n\r\n_Festuca elatior_, L. (Meadow Fescue). A valuable meadow and pasture\r\ngrass, though somewhat coarse. Several varieties are known. Best\r\non heavy soils. Deep rooted. Blade flat and broad, conduplicate,\r\nsharp-eared at the base, and there rough at the margin: lower surface\r\npolished. Rich green. Mid-rib flat above, numerous ribs with white\r\nlines between if held up and examined with a lens. Ligule obsolete\r\n(Figs. 12 and 17).\r\n\r\n_Arundo Phragmites_, L. (Common Reed). A large aquatic, reed-like\r\ncreeping grass, with broad leaves (3/4 to 1 in.), flat, rather rigid,\r\nacuminate, glaucous below, hispid at edges. Sheath smooth, striate,\r\nbearded at mouth. Ligule a mere fringe of hair. (Cf. _Digraphis_, p.\r\n54.)\r\n\r\n  _Cynosurus_ is not very liable to confusion; but it has resemblances\r\n  to _Lolium_ (see p. 49) and to species of _Agrostis_. The leaves\r\n  of _Cynosurus_ are firmer, thicker, less dry, and with a shining\r\n  undersurface, and the sheath is only split above, and yellow below;\r\n  whereas _Agrostis_ has relatively thin and dry leaves, rough surfaces\r\n  and margin, distinct ridges, and converging margins as the blade\r\n  nears the sheath.\r\n\r\n  _Festuca elatior_ is easily confused with the glabrous Bromes. For\r\n  _B. giganteus_ see p. 43.\r\n\r\n  _Bromus erectus_ is distinguished by the entire sheath,\r\n  usually hairy, the want of auricles, and the conduplicate--not\r\n  convolute--leaves.\r\n\r\n  _Agrostis_ has thinner, duller, and drier leaves, and no red sheath.\r\n\r\n  _Alopecurus pratensis_ has more depressed, flatter and broader ridges\r\n  than _Festuca_, and a longer ligule, and lacks the pointed ears.\r\n\r\n          ** _Ligule whitish, membranous, long, or at least well\r\n             developed. Sheaths not coloured or brown. Leaves\r\n             thin and rough, at least at the base. Ridges not\r\n             very prominent, but numerous and distinct._\r\n\r\n_Agrostis stolonifera_, L. (Fiorin). Stolons, with numerous short\r\noffsets bursting through the leaf-sheaths. Blade flat, rough, tapering,\r\nwith rounded ridges, and convolute in bud: there are no auricles, but\r\nthe blade may narrow, and form ledges, as it runs into the sheath.\r\nSheaths nearly smooth. Ligule long and pointed, and often toothed at\r\nthe margins. The leaves vary in breadth.\r\n\r\nThis and _A. vulgaris_, With. with shorter ligules, and, possibly, _A.\r\ncanina_, L. with finer leaves, are varieties of _A. alba_, L. Only the\r\nvariety _A. stolonifera_ is of moderate value for pasture, especially\r\non poor soils, as it lasts late into autumn: the others are weeds, like\r\ncouch-grass.\r\n\r\n  _Agrostis_ is full of difficulties for the beginner. The weed-forms\r\n  often spring up after wheat has been cut, and count as “twitch,” like\r\n  _Agropyrum_.\r\n\r\n  All the ordinary forms--_A. stolonifera_, _A. vulgaris_, and _A.\r\n  canina_--may be included in _A. alba_ (Linn.). On dry hills a close\r\n  tufted grass, with setaceous leaves, and in rich soils creeping and\r\n  luxuriant with broad leaves. It is one of the few grasses that thrive\r\n  in wet soils.\r\n\r\n  The chief points in the flat-leafed forms are the thin, dry leaves,\r\n  rough on both sides and on the margins, with distinct raised ridges,\r\n  and the base of the leaf narrowing suddenly into its insertion with\r\n  the sheath, with no auricle, but with a long membranous ligule. The\r\n  sheath not coloured, and the blade convolute.\r\n\r\n  Again, _A. stolonifera_ has a long, serrated, acute ligule, while _A.\r\n  vulgaris_ has a much shorter, entire and truncate one, and narrower\r\n  leaves.\r\n\r\n  _Agropyrum_ is the grass most likely to lead to confusion. Its\r\n  ears, lower ridges, very short or obsolete ligule, and pubescence\r\n  (sometimes glabrous) distinguish it.\r\n\r\n  _Cynosurus_ sometimes gives trouble (see p. 50) with _Alopecurus\r\n  pratensis_: the sheaths, ligule and flattened ridges should suffice\r\n  for distinction.\r\n\r\n  _Alopecurus geniculatus_ is even more like _Agrostis_, but its ridges\r\n  are more prominent and sharp, and its aquatic habit and bent “knees”\r\n  distinguish it.\r\n\r\n  _Alopecurus agrestis_, in dry corn-fields, has a thickened ligule,\r\n  sometimes coloured, and is annual or biennial, but otherwise very\r\n  like _Agrostis_.\r\n\r\n_Alopecurus pratensis_, L. (Meadow Foxtail). Large grass with stolons;\r\nvery early, and much prized as pasture and hay, but soon dies out\r\non light poor soils. Especially good for stiff soils. Sheaths long,\r\nridged, brown or nearly black at the base as they age. Ligule distinct\r\nand obtuse, entire. Leaves numerous. Blades long, dark green,\r\nsucculent and scabrous: ridges numerous and flat above, but distinct\r\n(Fig. 9).\r\n\r\n  _A. agrestis_, L. in S. England has shorter leaves, and ridges not\r\n  flattened; it is a troublesome pest of arable land, but does not\r\n  usually invade pasture.\r\n\r\n  _A. geniculatus_, L. is semi-aquatic, and like the last. It is easily\r\n  recognised by its sharply bent “knees,” and is of little value (Fig.\r\n  3).\r\n\r\n  _Alopecurus_ shows resemblances to _Lolium_ (see p. 49), _Festuca_\r\n  (see p. 50), and _Agrostis_ (see p. 52). If well grown its ridged\r\n  sheath and leaves, the former brown or black at the base, aid in\r\n  distinguishing it.\r\n\r\n      (2) Blades either devoid of ridges or with very inconspicuous\r\n          ones.\r\n\r\n        * _No trace of ridges, and the mid-ribs not prominent, but the\r\n          leaves show median lines flanked by finer ones when held up.\r\n          Blades thin and narrow. Somewhat keeled._\r\n\r\n          (i) _Shoots compressed._\r\n\r\n_Poa compressa_, L. (Flat-stemmed Meadow-grass). Leaves rather short,\r\nmore or less glabrous or glaucous, and +V+-shaped at the base; shoots\r\ncompressed, and naviculate in section. Ligule short and thin. Sheath\r\ntends to be closed below. A creeping perennial on commons and waste\r\nlands, and of little or no value.\r\n\r\n_Poa annua_, L. (Annual Meadow-grass). Small annual. Compressed shoots,\r\nlimp. Leaves linear, pale, sub-acute, thin, often wavy, flat, flaccid,\r\nbright green; dull or slightly shining and +V+-shaped in section below.\r\nLigule long, pointed, whitish and clasping the shoot. It is a harmless\r\nweed, and since it puts out shoots all the year round, furnishes a\r\ncertain amount of pasturage.\r\n\r\n          (ii) _Shoots terete or nearly so._\r\n\r\n_Poa nemoralis_, L. (Wood Poa). Leaves and sheaths smooth. Blade bright\r\ngreen, thin, often glaucous, linear-narrow, flaccid, acute. Ligule\r\nalmost obsolete. Section of shoots round. Of little value.\r\n\r\n_Poa bulbosa_, L. (Bulbous Meadow-grass). Stems bulbous at the base.\r\nLigule long and acute. Leaves very narrow and tapering. Sections of\r\nshoot round. Coasts of S. and E.\r\n\r\n  All the Poas, except the aquatic ones (_Glyceria_) and _P. maritima_,\r\n  have glabrous ribless blades with the median lines, and slight keel.\r\n\r\n  _P. pratensis_, _P. alpina_ and _P. trivialis_ (Fig. 8) have\r\n  entire sheaths (as have _Glyceria fluitans_, _G. aquatica_ and _P.\r\n  maritima_), but the others have them split some way down.\r\n\r\n  The leaves of _P. pratensis_ and _P. compressa_ are firmer than the\r\n  thin leaves of _P. annua_, _P. trivialis_ and _P. nemoralis_.\r\n\r\n  Sheaths flattened in _P. pratensis_, _P. compressa_, _P. annua_, and\r\n  _P. trivialis_; but rounded in _P. nemoralis_. _Glyceria aquatica_\r\n  and _G. fluitans_ have netted sheaths.\r\n\r\n  _Poa annua_ is annual, and _P. bulbosa_ has the bulbous base. _P.\r\n  maritima_ has involute leaves and no keel, and the rare _P. alpina_\r\n  has short rigid keeled mucronate leaves, with tip often inflexed and\r\n  thickened scabrid edges.\r\n\r\n  The leaves of Avena are apt to appear similar to those of the Poas\r\n  at first sight, but the former are hairy, and ridged, dry as well\r\n  as thin, and the peculiar median lines of _Poa_ are wanting. _Poa\r\n  bulbosa_ has drier leaves than usual, but its leaves are devoid of\r\n  ridges.\r\n\r\n        ** _Ridges can be detected, but are slight and not distinct.\r\n           Margins scabrid, at least at the base._\r\n\r\n          † _Leaves firm, flat, linear, acuminate, not narrowed\r\n            below.

Mid-rib and veins numerous, and prominent below.\r\nStoloniferous: branches extra-vaginal, often with deep red basal\r\nscales. Sheaths with much overlapping membranous margins, with a\r\ncollar-like ledge above. Ligule long and somewhat acute. Wet ditches,\r\n&c., of no value (Figs. 7, 14).\r\n\r\n  For distinction between _Digraphis_ and _Dactylis_ see p. 41. _Poa\r\n  pratensis_ is at once distinguished by its flattened shoots, more\r\n  rounded leaf apex and shorter ligule. _Arundo Phragmites_ is easily\r\n  distinguished by the ligule (see p. 51), and the other aquatic\r\n  grasses are quite different (see p. 39).\r\n\r\n_Phleum pratense_, L. (Timothy-grass). No stolons, but bulbous on\r\ndry ground. Early, and a heavy cropping hay grass: also excellent\r\npasture; branches intra-vaginal, but burst the glabrous sheaths.\r\nOld sheaths fibrous. Leaves short, convolute, with scabrid margins\r\nowing to deflexed teeth: ridges obsolete above, no keel; broader and\r\ngreyer green than _Alopecurus_. Ligule short on radical leaves, thin.\r\nPastures. Perennial.\r\n\r\n  The smooth ligule, deflexed marginal teeth, and no keel distinguish\r\n  it from _Arrhenatherum_.\r\n\r\n_Phleum arenarium_, L.

Ligule long. Sandy coasts, &c. A weed.\r\n\r\n  _Phleum asperum_, Jacq. and P. _Bœhmeri_, Schrad. are rare ruderal\r\n  plants, and _P. alpinum_, L. is confined to the Scotch Highlands. _P.\r\n  arenarium_ is sharply distinct by its conduplicate leaves and habitat.\r\n\r\n  _Alopecurus pratensis_ has narrower and less grey-green leaves than\r\n  _Phleum pratense_, its ligule is shorter and blunter, its sheath\r\n  more grooved and dark below, and the ridges more distinct and flat.\r\n  It is relatively well rooted and is stoloniferous.\r\n\r\n_Arrhenatherum avenaceum_, Beauv. (False Oat-grass). Loose tufts with\r\nshort stolons, or bulbous below. Leaves few, narrow, thin, dry, rough,\r\nwith very low flat ribs, convolute in bud, and practically glabrous.\r\nSheath smooth. Ligule truncate, hairy on its outer surface. Bitter, and\r\ncommonly undervalued by agriculturists, but useful in mixed pasture,\r\nand yields bulky, coarse hay.\r\n\r\n  There are often a few sparse isolated hairs on the low ribs. The base\r\n  enters the sheath with slight and sometimes pinkish ledges. Ridges\r\n  hardly observable. Traces of roughness if rubbed downwards. White\r\n  lines, about 5 each side on holding up to the light. The not very\r\n  long leaves taper slightly below.\r\n\r\n  _Arrhenatherum_ is liable to confusion with _Holcus_, _Anthoxanthum_,\r\n  _Molinia_ and _Avena_, but it is typically glabrous, whereas the\r\n  others are hairy.\r\n\r\n  From _Holcus_ it is easily distinguished by the sheaths, ligule and\r\n  soft hairs of that genus.\r\n\r\n  _Anthoxanthum_ differs in its habit, ears, scent, sheath and ligule.\r\n\r\n  _Molinia_ differs in habit, ligule, sheath, and tough stringy roots,\r\n  and the shape of the leaves.\r\n\r\n  _Avena pratensis_ differs in its narrow leaves, less prominent\r\n  ridges, and ligule; _A. flavescens_ in its much broader and coarser\r\n  hairy leaves, and the ligule; and _A. pubescens_ in pubescence and\r\n  flat-shoots and ligule.\r\n\r\n          †† _Leaves very thin, blade tapering below. Keel\r\n       prominent, but no ridges above. Ligule long and torn._\r\n\r\n_Milium effusum_, L. (Spreading Millet-grass). Tufted perennial. Leaves\r\nlinear-lanceolate, scabrid above. Sheath smooth. Bitter tasting. May be\r\nslightly hairy. Woods. It is much liked by birds, but is of no value in\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\n  +B. Leaves or sheaths, or both, distinctly hairy.+\r\n\r\n    (α) Leaf-blades eared at the base.\r\n\r\n      (_a_) Ears sharply pointed. Leaves convolute, and sections\r\n            of shoots round. Ligule short and inconspicuous.\r\n\r\n_Agropyrum repens_, Beauv. (Couch-grass). A troublesome weed of arable\r\nland and gardens, &c., owing to the extraordinary vitality of its\r\nunderground stolons. The young shoots are readily eaten by stock.\r\nPerennial, and extensively stoloniferous; bright or glaucous green.\r\nBlade thin, dry, rough edged, hairy and rough above, glabrous or\r\nhairy below. The short ligule fringed. Ears long, or sometimes short,\r\npointed; often obliquely crossing in front of the sheath. Ridges\r\ninconspicuous. Hairs may be absent from the sheath, and nearly so from\r\nthe blade.\r\n\r\n  The sea-shore varieties are stiffer and more glaucous, the leaves\r\n  more ribbed, involute and pointed--e.g. _A. junceum_, Beauv.\r\n\r\n_Agropyrum caninum_, Beauv. (Bearded Wheat-grass). Tufted weed, not\r\ncreeping, in woods, &c. Blade thinner and rougher beneath, but very\r\nvariable. Properties similar to those of _A. repens._\r\n\r\n  _Agropyrum_ may be confused with _Lolium_ (see p. 49) and _Agrostis_\r\n  (see p. 51), but hardly with any other grass, and with these only\r\n  because it is liable to be glabrous or nearly so on poor soil.\r\n\r\n  _Elymus_ has much more pronounced ridges than the sea-shore varieties\r\n  of _Agropyrum_.\r\n\r\n      (_b_) Base of blade with inconspicuous rounded ears. Leaves\r\n            convolute. Ligule conspicuous.\r\n\r\n_Anthoxanthum odoratum_, L. (Sweet Vernal-grass). Compact tuft. Common\r\nin pastures and hay, but it only forms a small proportion of the crop.\r\nOne of the earliest grasses, and the principal one, which gives the\r\nscent to new-mown hay: a perfume has been extracted from it. Its value\r\nas fodder is probably overrated. Bitter tasted. Leaves more or less\r\nhairy at margins, especially at throat of sheath, flat, and slightly\r\nridged. Sheath furrowed, often pubescent. Ligule long and blunt, with\r\nciliate margins. Sweet scented when dried. The most shallow rooted of\r\nall meadow-grasses. Leaves often short and few.\r\n\r\n  _Anthoxanthum_ is sometimes confused with _Arrhenatherum_ (see p. 56)\r\n  and _Molinia_; the latter differs in its ligule--a tuft of hair--its\r\n  stringy roots, tapering leaf-base, less obvious ridges, and smooth\r\n  sheaths, &c.\r\n\r\n  _Anthoxanthum_ is deep green and often very luxurious in rich wet\r\n  soils--e.g. in Devonshire.\r\n\r\n      (_c_) Ears as mere collar-like ledges where the blade joins\r\n            the sheath. Sheath usually pubescent or hispid with\r\n            reflexed hairs. Ridges inconspicuous. Ligule very\r\n            short.\r\n\r\n        ✲ _Perennial, with firmer leaves_.\r\n\r\n_Hordeum sylvaticum_, Huds. (Wood Barley). Leaves flat, thin but firm,\r\nrather broad, scaberulous. Sheath hispid, with reflexed hairs. Blade\r\nnot tapering below. Translucent spaces between the veins as broad as\r\nthe latter. Ligule short and blunt. Shady places. Useless.\r\n\r\n_Hordeum pratense_, Huds. (Meadow Barley). Tufted, or bulbous below.\r\nLeaves narrower, flat, tending to roll up, scabrid above and hairy\r\nbeneath. Sheath narrow, hairy. Moist meadows, and of some use as\r\npasture in the young state.\r\n\r\n        ✲✲ _Annual, with thin dry leaves_.\r\n\r\n_Hordeum murinum_, L. (Wall Barley). Coarse tufts; leaves small,\r\nnarrow, hairy or scabrid. Sheaths sparsely hispid, or very downy,\r\ninflated. Roads, &c. A useless weed.\r\n\r\n  _H. maritimum_, With. is a sea-side form, smaller and more glaucous.\r\n  Sheaths hairy.\r\n\r\n    (β) Leaf-blades not eared at the base.\r\n\r\n      * Sheaths of radical leaves veined with red-purple.\r\n\r\n_Holcus lanatus_, L. (Yorkshire Fog). A useless weed, but very common\r\nin pasture and hay; forming tussocks, greyish-green, softly hairy\r\n(tomentose). Blades with roundish ridges. Ligule short and obtuse.\r\nSheath somewhat keeled, with trace of collar ledge. It is said to have\r\na bitter taste (Fig. 15).\r\n\r\n  Ligule pilose. Tufted hairs along the broad rounded ridges, and on\r\n  the lower surface and prominent keel.\r\n\r\n  The much rarer _H. mollis_, L. is not so long-haired, except on the\r\n  nodes, and is more creeping and slender in habit. It is a “twitch.”\r\n\r\n  The Hordeums present several points of difficulty to beginners. The\r\n  differences between the species are given above. _H. maritimum_ has\r\n  narrower and thicker leaves than the rest.\r\n\r\n  Bromes are most likely to be confounded with Hordeums, but they have\r\n  entire sheaths and no ears (see p. 43).\r\n\r\n  For distinctions between _H. murinum_ and _Lolium_ see p. 49. _H.\r\n  sylvaticum_ and _Bromus asper_ (p. 44).\r\n\r\n      ** No conspicuously red-veined sheaths.\r\n\r\n        † Ligule absent, or a tuft of hairs.\r\n\r\n_Molinia cærulea_, Mœnch. (Purple Molinia). Tussocks, with tough\r\nstringy roots. Leaves narrowed below, and tapering above to a long\r\npoint, ridges obsolete; very thin and dry but fairly stiff, and hairy\r\nabove, especially at the base. Ligule absent, or a tuft of hairs.\r\nSheaths smooth. Moors. Useless as forage, but used locally for brooms.\r\n\r\n  _Molinia_ is not easily confounded with any others but _Anthoxanthum_\r\n  (see p. 57), _Arrhenatherum_ (see p. 56) or _Brachypodium_.\r\n\r\n  _Brachypodium sylvaticum_ is distinguished by habitat, its broad\r\n  leaves, membranous ligule, fibrous roots, &c.\r\n\r\n_Kœleria cristata_, Pers. (Crested Kœleria). Very short,\r\nperennial in dry pastures, pubescent, pale green. Leaves narrow,\r\ntapering below, soon involute, ciliated. Ridges prominent, alternately\r\nhigh and low. Ligule obsolete, or a mere jagged yellowish line. Useless.\r\n\r\n_Triodia decumbens_, Beauv. (Decumbent Heath-grass). Low perennial.\r\nLeaves narrow, obtuse, slightly ridged, tough, at length involute, with\r\nlong, soft hairs, especially below and on the edges. Sheath grooved,\r\nhairy, especially at the throat. Ligule a tuft of hairs. Section of\r\nshoot flat; leaves conduplicate. Of no known use as fodder.\r\n\r\n  The rare grasses _Panicum glabrum_, Gaud., _P. viride_, _L._ and _P.\r\n  Crus-galli_, L. introduced in the S.E. counties also come here.\r\n\r\n        †† _Ligule membranous._\r\n\r\n_Avena flavescens_, L. (Yellow Oat-grass). Loose tufted perennial,\r\npale green, with rounded shoots bursting the sheaths. Leaves flat,\r\nslender, soft, fine-ribbed and hairy, especially on the low ridges\r\nabove. Sheath hairy, especially below, not keeled. Ligule short,\r\nobtuse, often truncate, ciliate. A valuable pasture and meadow-grass,\r\nalso in water-meadows. Its roots are abundant, and it will grow well in\r\ncalcareous soils (see Fig. 10).\r\n\r\n_Avena pubescens_, Huds. (Downy Oat-grass). A variety of _A.\r\npratensis_ (see p. 47), but less densely tufted, and the leaves flat\r\nand pubescent, and especially the sheaths very pubescent. Ligule\r\novate-acute. Shoots flat. Dry districts, and a weed.\r\n\r\n  _Avena flavescens_ is not easily confounded with any other grass if\r\n  well grown. All the Poas otherwise like it are glabrous, and without\r\n  the ridges. The same applies to _A. pubescens_.\r\n\r\n  _Arrhenatherum_ is also glabrous, its leaves narrower, its ridges\r\n  much flatter and broader, and its ligule is hairy outside (see p. 56).\r\n\r\n_Brachypodium sylvaticum_, Beauv. (Wood False-brome). Rather slender,\r\nperennial. Leaves flat and devoid of ridges; long, very thin and dry,\r\nlimp, slightly tapering below, hirsute. Sheath round, hairy. Ligule\r\nfairly long, obtuse, toothed. Copses, &c. Useless.\r\n\r\n_Brachypodium pinnatum_, L. (Heath False-brome), is a species growing\r\nin the open, with narrow, firm, rigid, erect leaves, hardly hairy; with\r\ndistinct ridges, and tending to roll up. Ligule fringed with hair. Open\r\nheaths. Useless.\r\n\r\n  The only grasses likely to be confounded here are the Bromes, and\r\n  they have entire sheaths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nANATOMY AND HISTOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe principal anatomical features observed in the leaves of\r\ngrasses--apart from finer histological details into which it is\r\nnot my purpose to enter--concern the characters of the epidermis\r\nand distribution of the stomata and hairs, the arrangement of the\r\nchlorophyll-tissue, that of the mechanical tissue (sclerenchyma) and\r\nthe vascular bundles to which the venation and ribbing of the leaves\r\nare due, and the presence or absence of those peculiar thin-walled\r\ncells (motor-cells) which bring about the infolding or inrolling of\r\nthe lamina (see p. 25) as they lose water, and, finally, the presence\r\nor absence of conspicuous lacunæ or air-spaces so characteristic of\r\naquatic species. Several observers have occupied themselves with these\r\nmatters, and the researches of Schwendener, Duval Jouve, Pfitzer,\r\nPée-Laby, and others have rendered it possible to group most of our\r\ngrasses according to the microscopic characters of the leaves, somewhat\r\nas I have done in Chapter V.\r\n\r\nReference has been made to the rolling and folding of leaves, due to\r\nthe thin-walled cells on the upper surfaces capable of varying in\r\nturgescence (motor-cells). These are specially adapted epidermal cells\r\nfound on the upper surfaces only. In the leaves of _Poa compressa_,\r\n_P. annua_ (Fig. 21), _P. nemoralis_, _P. alpina_, _Catabrosa_,\r\n_Sesleria_, &c., a row of these motor-cells, easily distinguished by\r\ntheir large size, thin walls and clear contents, is found on each side\r\nof the mid-rib; as they dry the leaf folds its two halves together\r\n(conduplicate), and on the re-absorption of water they flatten the two\r\nhalves out again. In _Dactylis_ these flanking rows coalesce into one\r\nover the mid-rib. In other leaves, e.g. _Avena pratensis_, _Festuca\r\nelatior_ (Figs. 17, 22), _Melica_, _Elymus_ (Fig. 25), &c., there are\r\nin addition to these two flanking rows, other sets of motor-cells\r\nbetween the other ribs, and their combined action causes the halves of\r\nthe lamina to inroll, usually one-half inside the other--convolute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21. Transverse section of left-half of leaf of\r\n_Poa annua_ (× about 50) showing keel below, and two flanking lines of\r\nmotor-cells (slightly shaded) above the median vascular bundle of the\r\nmid-rib. Hence the leaf folds. The half lamina has six smaller vascular\r\nbundles, only the stronger one girdered. Ridges practically obsolete\r\nand subtending bands of sclerenchyma slight: hence the leaf-surfaces\r\nare parallel.]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to observe leaves of such grasses as _Festuca pratensis_\r\n(Fig. 22), _Aira cæspitosa_ (Fig. 23), &c., which are wide open in the\r\ndewy mornings in summer, close up as the air gets dry and hot; and any\r\nsuch leaf may be seen to roll up after plucking and can be reopened by\r\nmoistening it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Fig. 22. Transverse section of left-half of leaf of _Festuca\r\n  elatior_, var. _pratensis_ (× about 50). The ridges are well marked\r\n  and flattened above. The vascular bundles of two orders are girdered\r\n  below, but only slightly above. There is no keel. There are well\r\n  marked motor-cells--not shown in the figure--in each groove.]\r\n\r\nThe epidermis of grasses has been closely investigated by Grob, but\r\nunfortunately his results concern very few of our native species. The\r\nprincipal elements are ordinary elongated cells, with plane or sinuous\r\nwalls, various kinds of short cells intercalated between the ends of\r\nthese, several forms of papillæ, hairs, &c. and stomata.\r\n\r\nThe epidermis over the parenchyma of _Digraphis arundinacea_ consists\r\nof rectangular cells with plane walls.\r\n\r\nSeries or bands of long cells only may alternate with other series\r\nwhere short cells intervene between the long ones--e.g. _Nardus_.\r\n\r\n_Nardus_ has some of the bands devoid of stomata, but abounding in\r\nshort cells, whereas others (above) have stomata throughout.\r\n\r\nIn _Nardus stricta_, _Glyceria fluitans_, _Sesleria_, &c., there are\r\ntwo kinds of short cells, some siliceous, others cutinized only.\r\n\r\n_Nardus_ has closely appressed small 2-celled hairs bent at\r\nright-angles, and some epidermal and parenchyma cells--especially below\r\nthe stomata--have solid masses of silica filling the lumina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23. Part of transverse section of leaf of _Aira\r\ncæspitosa_ (× about 30). Ridges very high and acute, each tipped with\r\nsclerenchyma, and containing an isolated vascular bundle--sometimes\r\none or more small ones also. Motor-cells well developed at the base\r\nof each groove. The bundles are not girdered, but numerous bands of\r\nsclerenchyma almost join into a continuous band below. The leaf rolls\r\ninwards.]\r\n\r\nShort cells occur in _Holcus lanatus_, _Hierochloe borealis_ and\r\n_Dactylis glomerata_ interspersed between plane-walled cells.\r\nThey may be silicified and vary in shape--square, saddle-shaped,\r\nelliptical, irregular, &c.; or they may be replaced here and there\r\nby asperities--e.g. _Elymus_--or in rarer cases by stomata. Grob\r\nhas attempted the classification of their distribution in different\r\ngrasses, but the subject is too complex for treatment here.\r\n\r\nThe epidermis of many grasses is studded with short two-celled hairs\r\nbent sharply at right-angles; so that the pointed or blunt, hollow or\r\nsolid, apical portion is appressed to the surface. Grob says that these\r\nare absent from the Hordeæ, whereas 90% of the Panicoideæ and many\r\nspecies of all other groups have them. Examples of the sharply pointed\r\nform occur in _Nardus_, of blunt ones in _Cynodon_ &c.\r\n\r\nIn _Nardus_ they occur on the leaf surface both between and above the\r\nveins, but in _Hierochloe_ &c. they are confined to the margins.\r\n\r\nThe following grasses have no hairs of either type:\r\n\r\n  _Agrostis vulgaris_,\r\n  _Calamagrostis lanceolata_,\r\n  _Avena pratensis_,\r\n  _Arrhenatherum avenaceum_,\r\n  _Dactylis glomerata_,\r\n  _Briza media_,\r\n  _Arundo Phragmites_,\r\n  _Glyceria fluitans_.\r\n\r\nThe sharp, hard prickle-hairs which give the pronounced roughness to\r\nmany leaves of grasses are longer than the foregoing, and stand off\r\nmore from the leaf. They occur both on the surface and at the margins,\r\nand may be isolated--e.g. _Avena pratensis_,--or mixed with the short\r\ncells--_Aira canescens_, _Elymus arenarius_. They are very abundant on\r\n_Kœleria cristata_.\r\n\r\n_Leersia oryzoides_ has asperities at the margin of the leaf with their\r\npoints directed upwards on the upper part of the leaf, downwards on the\r\nbasal parts, and the direction of such minute marginal asperities often\r\naffords a useful distinctive character--e.g. _Phleum_, _Arrhenatherum_.\r\nThe marginal asperities in _Nardus_ are siliceous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24. Transverse section of part of leaf of\r\n_Agropyrum junceum_ (× about 40) partly inrolled; showing unequal\r\nridges. The principal vascular bundles are girdered below, the\r\nsclerenchyma joining into a strong continuous sheath. Each ridge is\r\ntipped with sclerenchyma, and each groove has motor-cells--not shown in\r\nthe figure--below.]\r\n\r\nBristles--i.e. long, sharp, stiff hairs--are not very common. They\r\noccur on _Nardus_, _Anthoxanthum Puelii_, _Panicum_, _Cynodon_.\r\n\r\nPapillæ occur on the leaves of _Glyceria_, _Nardus_, _Leersia_, &c.\r\n\r\n_Poa pratensis_ has soft hairs on the upper epidermis.\r\n\r\nThe stomata of _Sesleria cærulea_ are depressed and six-celled, two\r\nguard-cells being overgrown by four accessory cells, but in most\r\ngrasses they are of the ordinary type with two elongated guard-cells\r\nonly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25. Transverse section of part of leaf of _Elymus\r\narenarius_, partly inrolled (× about 30), showing ridges of unequal\r\nheight, of which the higher are flat above. Vascular bundles girdered,\r\nthe stronger above and below. Motor-cells in each groove cause the\r\ninrolling of the lamina by their contraction.]\r\n\r\nAs regards the vascular bundles constituting the venation, they are as\r\nis well known parallel from base to apex in our common grasses, with\r\nlinear leaves, and are usually of four orders as regards strength.\r\nThose of the first (e.g. mid-rib) and second orders have conspicuous\r\nvessels, but those of the third and fourth orders may be practically\r\ndevoid of vessels, though xylem and phloem elements are always\r\npresent. Contrary to the general assumption, there are frequent though\r\nminute transverse bundles joining the parallel veins.\r\n\r\nThe rule is that one vascular bundle runs up each mid-rib or ridge, but\r\nexceptions occur--e.g. in _Arundo_ several bundles run up the mid-rib,\r\nand in _Aira cæspitosa_ (Fig. 23) and others even the strong ribs may\r\nhave two or three bundles.\r\n\r\nEach vascular bundle has its own sclerenchyma sheath, and very often\r\nthe stronger veins are accentuated owing to the vascular bundle\r\nhaving a girder-like band of sclerenchyma running conjointly with\r\nits sheath and joining the latter above and below--or below only--to\r\nthe epidermis (Figs. 24 and 25). In many cases these lower girders\r\nspread out laterally below--fan-shaped in section--and nearly join the\r\nneighbouring girders.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the strands of sclerenchymatous supporting tissue do not\r\njoin the bundles, but run parallel to them, above or below, as separate\r\nstrands just beneath the epidermis.\r\n\r\nFinally, these strands may separate from the bundles, and fuse below\r\ninto a continuous layer under the epidermis; this occurs especially\r\nin leaves of xerophytes where the cuticle is well developed--e.g. in\r\nvarieties of _Festuca ovina_ (Fig. 18), _Aira flexuosa_ (Fig. 28).\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the strands of isolated sclerenchyma affords\r\ngood characters. While there are none in _Mibora_, we find one large\r\nstrand at the ridge of the keel and one at each margin, in addition to\r\nsmaller ones subtending each vascular bundle, in _Avena pubescens_,\r\n_Sesleria_, _Poa annua_ (Fig. 21), _P. bulbosa_, _P. compressa_ and\r\n_Dactylis glomerata_. In _Festuca ovina_, _F. rubra_, _F. heterophylla_\r\n(Figs. 18, 27) there are groups more or less pronounced at the keel and\r\nmargins, or even a continuous band below, but none above the bundles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26. Transverse section of leaf of _Nardus stricta_\r\n(× about 50). The upper surface is represented by the four grooves and\r\nfive ridges, each of the former with traces of motor-cells at its base.\r\nThe deep shaded portions are sclerenchyma, strong girders of which\r\njoin the vascular bundle of each ridge to the lower surface. This type\r\nis obviously derived from that in Fig. 19, and may be regarded as a\r\npermanently rolled leaf.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27. Transverse section of leaf of _Festuca ovina_,\r\nvar. _duriuscula_ (× about 50), the type of a permanently folded leaf.\r\nSeven ridges and six intervening grooves are seen: each of the latter\r\nwith traces of motor-cells below. In each ridge is an isolated vascular\r\nbundle, and a narrow sclerenchyma band below.]\r\n\r\nMany grasses have an isolated band above and below each primary bundle\r\nonly--e.g. _Panicum_, _Cynodon_--or above and below each of the other\r\nbundles as well--e.g. _Spartina_, _Arundo_, _Polypogon_, _Agrostis\r\nalba_, _Aira cæspitosa_ (Fig. 23), _Holcus lanatus_, _Glyceria\r\naquatica_, _G. fluitans_, _Digraphis_, _Elymus_ (Fig. 25), _Agropyrum_\r\n(Fig. 24), _Brachypodium_, _Nardus_ (Fig. 26). In _Psamma arenaria_ the\r\nlower bands join into a continuous layer.\r\n\r\nIn the following there is a band like a girder above and below each\r\nbundle, and contiguous with it, joining it to the epidermis above and\r\nbelow--_Leersia_, _Phleum pratense_, _Calamagrostis Epigeios_, _Bromus\r\nerectus_, &c.\r\n\r\nGüntz points out that xerophilous grasses are apt to have upright,\r\nnarrow (Figs. 26-28), grooved or folded leaves, with strong cuticle,\r\nand marked motor-cells when the leaves open. It is in grasses of\r\nthis kind, especially such as inhabit dry sandy districts, that the\r\nsubulate, solid or grooved leaves shown in Figures 18, 19 occur--e.g.\r\n_Festuca ovina_ and its varieties, _Aira flexuosa_, _Nardus stricta_,\r\n&c. The epidermal cell-walls are sinuous, the stomata protected--e.g.\r\non the flanks of ribs and in grooves--and waxy or hairy coverings\r\noccur. Colourless water-storing cells are apt to occur between or\r\naround the vascular bundles, and the chlorophyll-tissues tend to\r\nbe dense and well protected inside the leaf: strongly developed\r\nbast-sclerenchyma is also frequent (Fig. 18).\r\n\r\nIn shade-grasses, on the other hand, and in hygrophilous species, the\r\nleaves are as a rule flat, with thin epidermal cell-walls, which have\r\nplane sides, free stomata, and no wax &c. Water-storing tissue (apart\r\nfrom tropical species) is sparse or absent, and the chlorophyll-tissues\r\nhave well aerated lacunar spaces. Bast-sclerenchyma is in these cases\r\nfeebly developed.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapter I have brought together some of the principal\r\nanatomical features, in such form that the characters can be employed\r\nin checking other determinations of grass leaves. The results, which\r\nare based on the elaborate investigations of Duval Jouve, Schroeter,\r\nPée-Laby and Grob, as well as on my own observations, are not complete\r\nin all respects, and much more should be done to extend the theme, but\r\nthe account given will serve to show the student how such results may\r\nbe employed. It is as yet impossible to decide how far these characters\r\nare constant--they are known to be fairly so in many cases--but several\r\ngrasses cannot yet be distinguished by them alone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28. Transverse section of subulate leaf of _Aira\r\nflexuosa_ (× about 50), the upper surface represented by a mere ridge\r\nwith two flanking grooves each with but traces of motor-cells below.\r\nOne large vascular bundle and four much smaller ones are seen. There\r\nare no girders, but slender bands of sclerenchyma at the lower surface\r\nnearly join into a continuous sub-epidermal sheath. This type is the\r\nextreme form of that in Fig. 26.]\r\n\r\nIt should also be added that some grasses develope two types of leaves\r\n(heterophylly), solid or subulate below, flat or slightly inrolled\r\nabove--e.g. _Festuca heterophylla_--and the following arrangement is\r\nintended to apply to the vegetative lower leaves and not to those on\r\nthe upper parts of the flowering specimen. Moreover the sections should\r\nbe cut from the basal third of the lamina, and not from the tip of the\r\nleaf.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nGRASSES CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO THE ANATOMICAL CHARACTERS OF THE LEAF.\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. THE CHLOROPHYLL-TISSUE, ON TRANSVERSE SECTIONS, IS ARRANGED IN\r\n  RINGS ROUND THE VASCULAR BUNDLES. THERE ARE MOTOR-CELLS BETWEEN THE\r\n  RIBS, AND THE STOMATA ARE SUNK AND OCCUR ON BOTH FACES.\r\n\r\n_Cynodon Dactylon._ The larger lateral nerves have as a rule three\r\nsmaller ones between each pair, hardly projecting as ribs. Chlorophyll\r\nchiefly in a ring round the vascular bundle. Long hairs on lower\r\nsurface, a few papillæ above. Motor-cells in each shallow furrow. Short\r\ncells occur between the long epidermal cells over the bast-region.\r\n\r\n  The Panicums also come here, and differ according to the disposition\r\n  of the sclerenchyma sheaths around the bundles.\r\n\r\nII.

Vascular bundles midway between upper and\r\nlower surfaces.\r\n\r\n_Glyceria fluitans._ Section +V+-shaped and keeled, the roof of\r\neach polygonal lacuna arched, hence the “ribs” on the upper surface\r\nare between the vascular bundles. The latter lie nearer the lower\r\nepidermis. The epidermis has papillæ.\r\n\r\n  _Catabrosa aquatica_ and _Hierochloe_ also come here, the former with\r\n  small lacunæ, the latter with larger ones chiefly towards the upper\r\n  surface of the leaf.\r\n\r\n  _Digraphis_ is also apt to have a few air cavities near the mid-rib.\r\n\r\n  +B.

The mode of\r\nbranching is usually such that the youngest branches are nearest the\r\ntop, and the oldest nearest the bottom. It is evident at once, on\r\ncomparing the Moor Mat-grass (_Nardus_), Vernal-grass (_Anthoxanthum_),\r\nCock’s-foot (_Dactylis_), Meadow-grass (_Poa_) that considerable\r\ndifferences exist as to the extent of this primary branching of the\r\ninflorescence.\r\n\r\nIn _Nardus_ (Fig. 2) we find a number of long cylindrical-tapering\r\nbud-like structures each seated on one side of the principal stem, and\r\none over the other: in the Vernal-grass and Cock’s-foot we find tufts\r\nof such bud-like structures closely crowded round the upper end of the\r\nprincipal stalk, the whole forming an elongated tuft of tufts: in the\r\n_Poa_ we find a number of radiating, slender, long branches springing\r\nfrom the principal stalk, and each of these ramifies again, and yet\r\nagain, until each of the ultimate hair-like branches bears one of the\r\nbud-like structures. See also _Catabrosa_ (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 29. A spikelet of _Festuca elatior_, var.\r\n_pratensis_, from which the glumes and one palea (the outer) have been\r\nremoved to show the flower in situ (× 12). The two lodicules are in\r\nfront: the inner palea behind. Strasburger.]\r\n\r\nThe first thing for the student to apprehend is the nature of the\r\nbud-like structures referred to.\r\n\r\nEach of these is in itself a small tuft or bud of leaflike organs or\r\nscales arranged on a short twig (_Rachis_, _Rachilla_), as it were, and\r\nis called a _Spikelet_, and the true flowers of the grass are contained\r\nin the angles between the scales--the scales being popularly known as\r\n“_chaff_”: technically as _Glumes_ and _Paleæ_.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the structure of a spikelet the student\r\nshould carefully dissect a large one, such as that of an Oat (Fig.\r\n1). Proceeding from outside, he will find two large scales, like two\r\nboats, fixed below to the stalk (_rachis_) one just below the other,\r\nand shutting together as if hinged. These are called the _glumes_--the\r\ninner and outer glume respectively--and they enclose the rest of the\r\nspikelet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 30. Diagram of a spikelet of a grass as it would\r\nappear if the internodes between each set of organs were elongated.\r\n_g^1_ lower and _g^2_ upper glume. _P_ lower and _p_ upper palea of the\r\nsecond oldest flower _F^2_. _f_ a barren flower represented only by the\r\naxis and paleæ. Above it a single palea and the termination of the axis\r\n(_a_) of the spikelet.]\r\n\r\nInside them the axis or stalk (_rachis_) is continued for a short\r\ndistance only and on its sides are hinged two other pairs of more or\r\nless boat-shaped scales, smaller and more delicate than the glumes, and\r\nknown as the _pales_ (_paleæ_), while a third pair of still smaller\r\npales is fixed to the end of the axis. In each case one smaller and\r\nmore delicate _inner_ palea is hinged just inside its more obvious\r\n_outer_ palea. In the closed condition of the spikelet each of the\r\nthree pairs of pales is shut together, and pressed close to the axis,\r\nand the pair of glumes shut in the whole.\r\n\r\nOn opening each of the lower pairs of pales we find a _flower_ inside;\r\nbut the terminal pair usually contain only the barren end of the axis.\r\nHence the latter is barren and the former are fertile.\r\n\r\nEach fertile flower is found on careful dissection to consist of a\r\nsmall swollen _Ovary_, or young grain, covered with silky hairs and\r\nwith a couple of delicate plumes (the _Stigma_) at its apex, and three\r\nlong and slender _Stamens_; while the magnifying glass will show two\r\ntiny scales at the base--the _Lodicules_. All our ordinary grasses have\r\ntheir flowers thus constructed--a pair of _lodicules_, three dangling\r\n_stamens_ and an _ovary_ with a feathery two-plumed _stigma_: each such\r\nflower is also enclosed in its pair of _pales_, and the several pairs\r\nof pales of each spikelet, with their contents, are enclosed in the\r\npair of _glumes_ (Figs. 29-32).\r\n\r\nReturning now to the inflorescence. It is clear that we have to\r\ndistinguish between the entire branched total Inflorescence, and the\r\nSpikelets or partial inflorescences of which it is composed. In Botany\r\nit is agreed to call any inflorescence consisting of a stalk or axis on\r\nwhich the flowers are arranged without stalks--i.e. sitting directly\r\non it--and so that the youngest are above and the older below, a\r\n_Spike_, and each spikelet is _a little spike_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 31. Diagram of a spikelet of Wheat dissected (×\r\nabout 5) showing--from below upwards--the two glumes, two paleæ, two\r\nlodicules, three stamens, and the ovary of the typical grass. Oliver.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 32. Diagram of a spikelet of _Anthoxanthum_\r\ndissected (× about 8), and showing--from below upwards--two outer and\r\ntwo (awned) inner glumes, two paleæ, two stamens, and the ovary. There\r\nare no lodicules. Oliver.]\r\n\r\nOn looking at the total inflorescence of the _Nardus_ we see that we\r\nhave a number of spikelets seated on the sides of an axis: this is then\r\na spike of spikelets, or, shortly, a _Spike_[9] (Fig. 5). _Mibora_ and\r\n_Lepturus_ afford other examples. In _Panicum_, _Cynodon_ (Fig. 2) and\r\n_Spartina_ we have groups of such spikes.\r\n\r\nThe _Poa_ inflorescence is, however, different. It consists of a loose\r\nbranched system of spikelets. Botanists term such a loosely branching\r\nsystem, where each branch ends in a flower, a _panicle_: here then\r\nwe have a panicle of spikelets, or, shortly, a _Panicle_. _Aira_,\r\n_Agrostis_, _Calamagrostis_, _Avena_, _Catabrosa_ (Fig. 4) and many\r\nothers afford further examples.\r\n\r\nIn _Dactylis_ we have a condition of affairs between the two extremes\r\ngiven: the inflorescence is not so close a spike as _Nardus_, and\r\nnot so open a panicle as _Poa_--it is rather a spike-like panicle,\r\npartaking of the nature of both. A special type of this (Foxtail)\r\noccurring in certain grasses--e.g. _Phleum_, _Alopecurus_, _Phalaris_\r\nand _Lagurus_,--is so characteristic as to be worth noting (Fig. 3).\r\n\r\nThere is also another aspect of these inflorescences which is not\r\nwithout interest as showing how diagnostic characters may be obtained\r\nfrom purely external features, easily observed in the field. We have\r\nseen that in _Nardus_ the spikelets are arranged on one side only\r\nof the rachis, or main axis, so that about three quarters of the\r\ncircumference of the latter is bare; whereas in _Lolium_--with which\r\n_Agropyrum_ and _Brachypodium_ agree in this respect--the spikelets are\r\non opposite sides, leaving the intervening two quarters, i.e. half its\r\nsurface, of the circumference of the axis naked.\r\n\r\nIn _Cynosurus_ and the simpler forms of _Dactylis_, we find the\r\nspikelets crowded round about three quarters of the surface of the\r\nrachis, leaving the fourth quarter naked; and, finally, in _Phleum_,\r\n_Alopecurus_, _Hordeum_, and _Anthoxanthum_ the spikelets cover the\r\nentire surface.\r\n\r\nIn the first (_Nardus_) and third examples (_Cynosurus_, _Dactylis_)\r\nwhere the spikelets are turned to one side, the inflorescence is said\r\nto be _secund_.\r\n\r\nThe next point to notice is that not every grass has so many as two\r\nfertile flowers and one barren one in its spikelet, as the Oat has.\r\nA spikelet may have one (_Phleum_), two (_Aira_) or three (_Avena_)\r\nor more (_Poa_) fertile flowers, and no barren ones or several, the\r\nnumber of flowers being counted by the number of pairs of pales found\r\ninside the pair of glumes. Moreover every flower is not necessarily\r\nfertile (e.g. _Arrhenatherum_, _Holcus_) and several grasses have\r\none or more flowers in each spikelet containing _stamens_ only--male\r\nflowers--while others may have _ovaries_ only--female flowers. In some\r\nexotics the male and female flowers are on different parts of the same\r\nplant (Maize) or even on different plants (_Gynerium_), an arrangement\r\nnot met with in our grasses. Accordingly, it is of importance in\r\ndetermining a grass to discover how many flowers the spikelet contains,\r\nand whether any are male only, or barren, &c., as well as to make out\r\nthe character of its inflorescence.\r\n\r\nIn the following lists I have brought together some of the chief points\r\nwith illustrative examples.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIKELETS with only one perfect flower (without rudimentary ones).\r\n\r\n  _Psamma._\r\n  _Milium._\r\n  _Nardus._\r\n  _Alopecurus._\r\n  _Phleum._\r\n  _Hordeum._\r\n  _Agrostis._\r\n\r\nAnd species of the rare grasses _Calamagrostis_, _Mibora_, _Lepturus_,\r\n_Spartina_, _Cynodon_, _Gastridium_, _Lagurus_, _Polypogon_, _Leersia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIKELETS with one perfect flower and one or more male or rudimentary\r\nones.\r\n\r\n  _Digraphis._\r\n  _Anthoxanthum._\r\n  _Holcus._\r\n  _Arrhenatherum._\r\n\r\nAnd the rare genera _Hierochloe_ and _Panicum_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIKELETS with at least two perfect flowers.\r\n\r\n  _Molinia._\r\n  _Arundo._\r\n  _Avena._\r\n  _Aira_ (some species).\r\n  _Bromus._\r\n  _Cynosurus._\r\n  _Dactylis._\r\n  _Triodia._\r\n  _Sesleria._\r\n  _Kœleria._\r\n  _Melica_ (one species).\r\n  _Briza._\r\n  _Poa trivialis._\r\n  _Catabrosa._\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIKELETS with at least three perfect flowers and usually more.\r\n\r\n  _Elymus._\r\n  _Agropyrum._\r\n  _Brachypodium._\r\n  _Lolium._\r\n  _Festuca._\r\n  _Poa._\r\n  _Glyceria._\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLORESCENCE, a spike of single spikelets.\r\n\r\n  _Agropyrum._\r\n  _Brachypodium._\r\n  _Lolium._\r\n  _Nardus._\r\n\r\nAnd varieties of _Festuca Myurus_ and _F. loliacea_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLORESCENCE, a spike of pairs or tufts of three or more spikelets.\r\n\r\n  _Elymus_ (pairs).\r\n  _Hordeum_ (threes).\r\n  _Cynosurus_ (clusters).\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLORESCENCE, a cylindrical closely tufted spike-like panicle.\r\n\r\n  _Phleum._\r\n  _Alopecurus._\r\n  _Psamma._\r\n  _Anthoxanthum._\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLORESCENCE, a compact more or less tufted panicle.\r\n\r\n  _Molinia._\r\n  _Kœleria._\r\n  _Triodia._\r\n  _Dactylis._\r\n  _Aira præcox._\r\n  _A. canescens._\r\n  _Sesleria._\r\n\r\nAnd rare grasses like _Polypogon_, _Gastridium_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLORESCENCE, a loose plume-like or branched panicle.\r\n\r\n  _Avena._\r\n  _Bromus._\r\n  _Arrhenatherum._\r\n  _Catabrosa._\r\n  _Aira_ (except _A. præcox_ and\r\n  _A. canescens_).\r\n  _Arundo._\r\n  _Digraphis._\r\n  _Milium._\r\n  _Agrostis._\r\n  _Melica._\r\n  _Holcus._\r\n  _Poa_ (most of the species).\r\n  _Glyceria._\r\n  _Briza._\r\n  _Festuca_ (except _F. Myurus_).\r\n\r\nAnd the rare _Hierochloe_.\r\n\r\nThe _Glumes_ are always present in our grasses, and rudimentary only\r\nin the rare grass _Leersia_; but _Lolium_ and _Nardus_ have only _one_\r\nglume to the spikelet, and _Hierochloe_, _Digraphis_ and _Anthoxanthum_\r\n(Fig. 32) have four or six. Our other grasses have _two_, but often\r\nunequal in size.\r\n\r\nIn shape they are usually boat-like, pointed or obtuse (_Briza_) and\r\nfrequently with a distinct keel (_Anthoxanthum_, _Digraphis_, _Phleum_,\r\n&c.) or with ridges, green lines (veins) and other characteristic\r\nmarkings (e.g. _Digraphis_). The tip may be extended into a stiff long\r\npoint or awn (_Agropyrum_, _Phleum_, _Nardus_) and the keel, ribs,\r\nand awn may have hairs or serrulæ on them. The rule is, however, that\r\nthe glumes are not awned. In texture the glumes may be herbaceous and\r\ngreen-brown or purple (e.g. _Melica_) or membranous or stiff, or\r\nscarious (i.e. browned, as if scorched) at the edges. In _Hordeum_ some\r\nof the glumes are so narrow and pointed as to resemble stiff awns. In\r\n_Catabrosa_ the glumes are truncate, as if bitten off at the top.\r\n\r\nThe _Paleæ_ are also often more or less boat-shaped, or flat ovate or\r\noblong scales, usually more delicate than the glumes and frequently\r\npointed, or (especially the outer pale) awned at the tip: in some\r\ncases, however, the awn springs from the middle or base of the back of\r\nthe pale, and the latter may be bifid at its apex. The pale has usually\r\na distinct middle nerve. The inner pale is commonly the smaller and\r\nmore delicate of the two, and is sometimes difficult to see.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSPICUOUSLY AWNED GRASSES.\r\n\r\n  _Avena._\r\n  _Arrhenatherum_ (Fig. 33).\r\n  _Hordeum._\r\n  _Bromus._\r\n  _Agropyrum caninum._\r\n  _Lolium temulentum._\r\n  _Brachypodium sylvaticum._\r\n  _Festuca Myurus._\r\n\r\nAnd a few rare grasses like _Panicum_, _Polypogon_, _Lagurus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRASSES WITH NO TRUE AWNS.\r\n\r\n_Kœleria.

The\r\nstamens have slender filaments and large versatile anthers, which\r\ndangle from between the paleæ when the flowers are mature, scattering\r\ntheir clouds of fine pollen in the wind (Fig. 33).\r\n\r\nAll our ordinary grasses except _Nardus_--where there is a simple\r\nstraight hairy style--have two spreading feathery stigmatic plumes,\r\nwhich stand out right and left from between the paleæ when the pollen\r\nis flying about on the wind. (Fig. 33.)\r\n\r\nMuch interesting speculation has been expended in attempting to explain\r\nthe morphological or theoretical significance of the parts of the\r\nspikelet of a grass. If we project the various organs on a flat surface\r\nin the form of a plan, keeping their relative positions intact, we\r\nobtain a diagram such as that shown in Fig. 34.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 34. Diagram of a spikelet of a grass. The two\r\nglumes--_g^1_ outer, _g^2_ inner--embrace four flowers, of which 1 is\r\nthe lowermost and 4 the uppermost.]\r\n\r\nThe comparison of numerous cases, and the study of the development of\r\nthe parts on the microscopic growing point dissected out from young\r\nbuds, have suggested that the inner and outer glumes are bracts, or\r\ncovering leaves, at the base of the true spikelet. In like manner\r\nthe two paleæ are bracteoles which subtend the flower proper. On this\r\nassumption they can be compared with the corresponding structures in\r\nother plants; whereas any attempt to compare the paleæ or glumes with\r\nthe sepals and petals of ordinary flowers breaks down.\r\n\r\nA curious interest attaches to the awns so often found on the backs of\r\npaleæ, and especially to those where the (sub-terminal) awn springs\r\nfrom just below the bifid apex (e.g. _Avena_, &c.).\r\n\r\nHackel showed by comparison with a rolled leaf attached to its sheath\r\nand ligule (e.g. _Psamma_) that such an awn as that of _Bromus\r\nAlopecurus_ attached to its palea stands in the relation of a leaf to\r\nits sheath, the part of the palea above the insertion corresponding\r\nto the ligule, the awn itself to the lamina, and the palea below its\r\ninsertion to the sheath. This view is rendered the more probable by the\r\nanatomy of the awn and by the observations of Schmid, who has shown\r\nthat the awns of cereals contain chlorophyll-tissue and a vascular\r\nbundle, and have stomata, and his experiments led him to conclude that\r\nin the young condition they transpire and assimilate, and probably even\r\ncontribute to the nutrition of the ripening grain. When dry and mature\r\nthe awns subserve biological functions of quite another kind, and as\r\nwe shall see are of importance in the distribution and sowing of the\r\ngrains. (Fig. 42.)\r\n\r\nReturning to the floral diagram, we see that the two lodicules, the\r\nthree stamens and the ovary still remain to be explained. Much\r\ndiscussion has been held regarding the lodicules. Functionally\r\nthey are said to aid in the divarication of the paleæ when the\r\nperiod of anthesis arrives, and the stamens and stigmatic lobes\r\nare to be exposed, by swelling and driving the valve-like paleæ\r\napart. Morphologically they have been explained as representing the\r\nrudimentary perianth, here reduced to two minute scales, but in some\r\nexotic grasses (_Bambusa_, _Stipa_, &c.) three lodicules, or even\r\nmore, are present. (Figs. 35, 36.) On the other hand they may be, and\r\nprobably are, scales of the nature of minute bracteoles and of no\r\nsignificance to the flower itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 35. Floral diagram of ordinary grass. Each pair\r\nof paleæ--_i.p._ inner and _o.p._ outer palea--encloses three stamens\r\n(_s_), two lodicules (_l_) and the ovary. _st_, stigmatic plumes. _a_,\r\naxis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 36. Floral diagram of a Bamboo, showing six\r\nstamens, three inner (_i.s._) and three outer (_a.s._), and three\r\nlodicules (_l_) in addition to the ovary. _i.p._ inner and _o.p._ outer\r\npalea. _a_, axis.]\r\n\r\nIf this is so the flower of the grass is perfectly naked, and consists\r\nin the typical case of three stamens and one carpel. The development\r\nof the ovary lends no support to the view that there are two carpels:\r\nthe stigmatic plumes are not separate styles. Nor does the fact that\r\nsome grasses have six stamens lend support to the idea that the flower\r\nis derived from the trimerous type so common in Monocotyledons: other\r\nnumbers may occur--e.g. as few as two (_Anthoxanthum_, Fig. 32) or even\r\none only (_Uniola_, _Cinna_, &c.) or as many as 20 or 40 in certain\r\nother exotic grasses.\r\n\r\nEven when three stigmatic plumes are developed, as in some Bamboos,\r\nclose investigation does not confirm the view that the ovary consists\r\nof more than one carpel.\r\n\r\nWe must therefore regard the flower of the grass as typically composed\r\nof one carpel and three stamens, with no perianth whatever. It is\r\nsubtended by one or more bracteoles (the lodicules), and enclosed in a\r\npair of bracteoles one higher than the other (the paleæ). The glumes\r\nare bracts of the partial inflorescence--the spikelet.\r\n\r\nThat there are some departures from this type in detail does not\r\ninvalidate the importance of the fact that most grasses conform to it.\r\n\r\nI now pass to the consideration of a grouping of our ordinary grasses\r\naccording to their floral arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe student should distinctly understand that the following notes are\r\nintended to serve as an introduction to the floral characters of our\r\ngrasses, and not to replace the study of the Flora. I have dealt\r\nwith this section of the subject less in detail, because our best\r\nFloras give so much information that it seemed undesirable to do more\r\nthan attempt to guide the reader in the recognition of the genera and\r\nprincipal species by means of external features easily observed by\r\nanyone with a little care. The detailed and critical examination of\r\nspecies, varieties and rare forms should always be done with reference\r\nto a complete Flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nGRASSES GROUPED ACCORDING TO THEIR FLOWERS AND INFLORESCENCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

(Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\n  The much rarer _Mibora verna_ about three inches or so high, and\r\n  _Lepturus_, both with flat leaves, also come here.\r\n\r\n  Certain superficial resemblances in the habit or inflorescence in\r\n  _Festuca Myurus_ and rare forms like _Spartina_, may occasionally\r\n  cause hesitation until the spikelets are examined.\r\n\r\n    +B.

The purely\r\n  superficial resemblances in the inflorescences of _Polypogon_,\r\n  _Lagurus_, and _Cynosurus echinatus_--all extremely rare\r\n  species--disappear at once on examination.\r\n\r\n  In _Bromus erectus_ the equally superficial resemblance is due to the\r\n  stiff awns: the spikelet has six to twelve flowers and is stalked.\r\n\r\n  It should also be noted that _Hordeum sylvaticum_ occasionally has a\r\n  rudimentary second flower in the lateral spikelets (see note p. 105).\r\n\r\n        (α) A shade-grass with the central spikelet only imperfect;\r\n           staminate, or rudimentary, or entirely wanting.\r\n\r\n           _H. sylvaticum_, Huds.\r\n\r\n        (β) The central spikelet is the perfect one, the two lateral\r\n            barren.

When the paleæ open these\r\nstigmatic plumes protrude, one on either side, and readily catch pollen\r\nshed from the dangling stamens and carried by the wind, and since the\r\npollen of the same flower is usually shed at a time when the stigmas\r\nof many neighbouring plants are mature, there is every opportunity for\r\ncross-fertilisation. (Fig. 33.)\r\n\r\nIn some cases, however, e.g. _Anthoxanthum_, _Alopecurus_, the flowers\r\nare proterogynous, the stigmatic plumes being ready for pollination\r\nsome time before the pollen is shed from the anthers of the same\r\nflower; whereas in most of our grasses the pollen begins to scatter\r\nbefore the stigmas are ready (protandrous). Among exotic grasses, many\r\nare diœcious or monœcious--i.e. the flowers contain stamens\r\nonly or ovary only, on each plant, or on different inflorescences\r\nof the same plant respectively--and even in our own _Holcus_ and\r\n_Arrhenatherum_ this state of affairs is partially represented, since\r\none flower of the spikelet is male only.\r\n\r\nIn some grasses, e.g. Rye, however, it appears improbable that\r\ncross-fertilisation ever occurs, since the paleæ do not open, and the\r\npollen falls on to the stigma direct; and in _Leersia_ and the foreign\r\n_Amphicarpum_ the spikelets are completely cleistogamous, those of the\r\nlatter being on stalks close to the ground which push the flowers into\r\nthe soil, where pollination and fructification are accomplished.\r\n\r\nHybrid grasses are by no means uncommon. To say nothing of the numerous\r\ncross-bred Wheats and Barleys, artificial hybrids have been raised\r\nbetween Wheat and Rye. In the Maize an astonishing number of selected\r\ncross-breeds have been obtained, and, among others, certain forms in\r\nwhich the seeds have a violet outer layer and a sugary endosperm, are\r\nfound to transmit these characters to the resulting seed of a variety\r\nwhich would normally have produced seed with white outer layers and\r\nstarchy endosperm, if the pollen of the former is used on the stigma of\r\nthe latter. Such direct influences of the pollen are termed _Xenia_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 37. Pollen-grains adherent to the papillæ of the\r\nstigma, on which they germinate, sending the pollen-tubes down between\r\nthe cells. Kerner. × about 100.]\r\n\r\nWhen the pollen-grain, having adhered to the hairy stigma, has begun\r\nto germinate, the resulting pollen-tube creeps down between the cells\r\nof the stigma, and hands over its enclosed nuclei to the embryo-sac,\r\nwhere fertilisation of the egg-cell is accomplished, by the fusion\r\nof one of the pollen nuclei with the nucleus of the egg-cell. As the\r\nresulting embryo developes, the sac becomes filled with endosperm-cells\r\ncharged with starch-grains or sugar, and in the ripe seed the embryo is\r\nalways found affixed laterally and below to this endosperm--a point of\r\ndistinction from Sedges, where the embryo is buried in the endosperm.\r\n\r\nThe ripe seed fills the ovary, and its outer walls usually fuse with\r\nthose of the carpel, forming the well-known _Caryopsis_ or “grain.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 38. Longitudinal median section of the caryopsis\r\nof a grass--e.g. _Lolium_ (× about 35). _p_, pericarp; _t_, attachment\r\nto axis; _m_, position of micropyle; _E_, endosperm; _A_, its aleurone\r\nlayer; _l_, folded leaves of plumule; _r_, radicle; _r´´_, secondary\r\nroots; _RC_, root-cap; _s_, scutellum. The dark line _e_ represents the\r\nsurface where the face of the scutellum is applied to the endosperm and\r\nwhere absorption of the latter takes place.]\r\n\r\nIf such a “grain” is carefully examined, three chief parts are visible\r\nin addition to the embryo. (Fig. 38.) Firstly, we find on the outside\r\nthe fused seed- and fruitcoats, differing in the number of layers and\r\nin the microscopic characters of the cells, some of which characters\r\ncan be employed in diagnoses. (Fig. 39.)\r\n\r\nSecondly, the great mass of the “grain” internally is composed\r\nof delicate cells filled in most cases with starch-grains, the\r\nsizes, shapes and arrangement of which can also be employed for\r\ndiagnoses--e.g. the compound grains of the Aveneæ and Festuceæ\r\nare different from the simple polyhedral or rounded grains of the\r\nAndropogoneæ and Maydeæ, and some races of Maize have sugar and soluble\r\nstarch instead of grains of the latter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 39. Transverse section (highly magnified) through a\r\ngrain of _Brachypodium pinnatum_ taken about half-way up. 1, epidermis;\r\n2, pericarp; 3, remains of the true seed-coat; 4, vascular bundle; 5,\r\nremains of nucellus; _P_, epidermis of nucellus; _G_, aleurone layer:\r\nremarkable in being several cells thick; _E_, endosperm. Harz.]\r\n\r\nThirdly, the outermost layer or layers of cells of the endosperm are\r\nfilled with proteids, and are known as the Aleurone layer. (Fig. 38,\r\n_A_.)\r\n\r\nThe embryo consists of the folded embryonic leaves in bud (plumule)\r\nabove, which will grow up on germination as the shoot or “spear,” the\r\nshort primary root (radicle) below, with in many cases two or more\r\nsecondary rootlets already showing in its tissues, and from the common\r\n“collar” uniting these a more or less prominent shield-shaped organ\r\n(scutellum) standing out laterally in contact with the endosperm, the\r\ndissolved contents of which it absorbs on germination. (Fig. 38, _s_.)\r\n\r\nAlthough typical grasses form a caryopsis as described, exceptions\r\noccur. In the exotic _Sporobolus_, _Eleusine_, _Crypsis_ and\r\n_Heleochloa_ the fruit becomes truly dehiscent, the seed being loose in\r\nthe fruit, and the latter opens and allows it to fall out; and in many\r\nBamboos the seed is loose in the _achene_, while in a few cases--e.g.\r\n_Melocanna_--the fruit is fleshy and may be as big as a walnut.\r\n\r\nReturning to the typical grasses. When the fruit ripens in the\r\nspikelet, several events may happen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 40. _Triodia decumbens. a_, “seed,” nat. size;\r\n_b_, ditto, × 6. Note the basal hair-tuft and rachilla, and the\r\nciliate, toothed outer palea with a short awn-point, enclosing the\r\ninner more delicate palea. Between the two lies the caryopsis. Nobbe.]\r\n\r\nIn most of our grasses the caryopsis comes away trapped between its\r\ntwo paleæ, and the latter bring away with them the small piece of\r\nthe axis of the spikelet on which they stand: this bit of axis--the\r\n_rachilla_--often affords valuable characters in diagnosis. (Fig. 41.)\r\nIt is the pair of paleæ enclosing their caryopsis which goes by the\r\nname of “seed” in most of our grasses. (Fig. 40.)\r\n\r\nIn a few cases, however, e.g. _Panicum_, the spikelet comes away as a\r\nwhole, so that here the “seed” consists of the glumes, enclosing one,\r\ntwo or more pairs of paleæ with their contained caryopses.\r\n\r\nEven among our native grasses, however, cases occur where the\r\nseparation takes place below some of the glumes, and so the “seed,” as\r\nmet with in samples, consists of glumes as well as enclosed paleæ and\r\ncaryopsis--e.g. _Anthoxanthum_, _Alopecurus_, &c.--and some care is\r\nnecessary in examining grass “seed” in these circumstances (see p. 134).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 41. Diagram of a spikelet of a grass--e.g.\r\n_Festuca_--comprising six matured flowers and their paleæ, embraced\r\nby the two glumes (_g^1g^2_) at the moment of disarticulation as the\r\nfruits ripen. The small piece of axis (_a_) left attached to each\r\nsegment is the rachilla _R_. At _p^2_ the tip of the inner palea is\r\nvisible protruding from the outer one _p^1_: in the rest it is still\r\nenclosed in the latter.]\r\n\r\nInteresting biological adaptations are met with in the distribution\r\nof grass “seeds.” The very small and light fruits of _Agrostis_\r\neasily fall and are scattered by the wind, but in many cases the\r\nglumes (_Holcus_) or paleæ (_Briza_) are expanded and serve as “wings”\r\noffering extensive surfaces to the wind. In _Arundo_, _Calamagrostis_,\r\n_Aira_, &c., fine silky hairs attached to the rachilla serve a similar\r\nfunction, reminding us of the _coma_ of true seeds and the _pappus_ of\r\nComposites. In _Hordeum jubatum_ of the prairies, the axis breaks up\r\nand the disarticulated portions with their attached tufts of fruits\r\nare blown away by the wind, and something similar occurs in our own\r\n_H. murinum_ to a less extent. In the exotic _Spinifex_ whole heads of\r\nfruits are thus detached and blown over the sands as “tumble weeds.”\r\n\r\nIn _Stipa pennata_ we have an example of perhaps the most complex of\r\nall such adaptations: the exceedingly long awn terminating the palea\r\nis plumose at the upper end and twisted below, and the hard sharp\r\nrachilla at the base of the fruit is furnished with short, stiff hairs\r\ndirected upwards. The plumed awn serves as a wind surface, the whole\r\nfruit flying like an arrow through the air. The stiff hairs below serve\r\nto fix the lower end between particles of soil, and by their alternate\r\ndrying and wetting, the warping of these and of the twisting and\r\nuntwisting awn drives the sharp base into the soil. (Fig. 42.) Similar\r\nmechanisms exist in _Avena_ and others.\r\n\r\nThese bristles and awns also subserve dissemination in other ways,\r\nespecially by clinging to the wool and fur of sheep and other animals,\r\nand cases occur where the twisting awns and reflexed hairs on the hard\r\npointed fruit-base drive the latter into the bodies of sheep with fatal\r\neffects--e.g. _Stipa capillata_ in Russia, _S. spartea_ in America,\r\n_Aristida hygrometrica_ in New Zealand, _Heteropogon contortus_ in New\r\nCaledonia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 42. Awned fruit of _Stipa_. The reflexed stiff\r\nhairs and hard point favour penetration into the soil. The long twisted\r\nawn performs hygroscopic movements, and its terminal plume offers\r\nsurface to the wind. Lubbock.]\r\n\r\nThe driving action of even small reflexed asperities on awns is well\r\nillustrated by the fruits of _Hordeum_, which are often made by\r\nchildren to creep up the sleeve.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to examine the external features of the “seeds” of\r\ngrasses--usually the caryopsis enclosed in one or more paleæ, but\r\nsometimes in glumes as well--the following diagnostic characters are of\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe size varies from lengths of 2 mm. or less (_Poa_, _Aira_)\r\n(Figs. 43, 44) to 15-20 mm. or more (_Arrhenatherum_) (Fig. 47)\r\nand distinction must be made between the various characters of the\r\ncaryopsis devoid of its coverings (paleæ, glumes) and such as really\r\nbelong to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe caryopsis proper may be short and stout and devoid of a\r\ngroove--“Millet-seed” type (Fig. 45)--but is oftener elongated, like a\r\ngrain of Wheat, and then has the characteristic longitudinal groove on\r\nthe face opposite that where the embryo is situated (Fig. 46). Details\r\nof shape--e.g. cylindroid, fusiform, flattened, &c.--are also of\r\ndiagnostic value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 43. _Poa annua. d_, the “seed,” nat. size; _a_\r\nand _b_, ditto, × about 7; _c_, caryopsis, natural size (above) and\r\n× about 7. Note the ribs and silky keel. No “web.” Nobbe. Cf. Figs.\r\n54-56.]\r\n\r\nIn many cases the “seed,” consisting of the caryopsis closely\r\ncompressed between the paleæ, is boat-shaped, e.g. _Lolium perenne_,\r\n_Festuca elatior_. If this “boat” is long and narrow it may be termed\r\nbarge-shaped, e.g. _Brachypodium sylvaticum_, &c. (Figs. 71, 72): if\r\nshort, broad, and open or shallow, the term coracle-shaped seems to\r\napply, e.g. _Bromus arvensis_ (Fig. 73).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 44. _Aira cæspitosa._ The minute “seed” (nat. size)\r\nis seen to the right, and the caryopsis (nat. size) to the left of _c_,\r\nthe caryopsis, × 8. _a_ and _b_, the “seed,” × 10.

Note the large smooth rachilla. Nobbe.\r\nCf. Fig. 57.]\r\n\r\nFurther important distinctive characters are obtained from the absence\r\nor presence of awns, and the peculiarities--length, stiffness, &c.--of\r\nthe latter. The awns may be straight, hooked, or kneed (i.e. sharply\r\nbent); twisted or not; smooth or serrulate. They may be inserted at the\r\nbase or near the middle of the back of the investing palea, or glume,\r\nor near its apex, as indicated by the terms basal, dorsal, sub-terminal\r\n(see Figs. 47-50).\r\n\r\nSome difficulty arises in connection with terminal awns. In some\r\ncases there is a true awn--i.e. a distinct bristle or hair--at the\r\napex of the palea, and apparently continuing its substance without\r\ninterruption; but in most instances close examination shows that this\r\nawn arises from between two minute teeth, and is really inserted at the\r\nback of the slight depression between them--e.g. _Lolium temulentum_\r\n(Fig. 48), _Brachypodium pinnatum_ (Fig. 77), &c.\r\n\r\nIn another class of cases the awn appears to be really the prolongation\r\nof the palea--e.g. _Nardus_ (Fig. 81), _Festuca Myurus_ (Fig. 80),\r\n&c.--and when it runs out into a distinct bristle we may speak of a\r\nterminal awn without staying to discuss whether or no it is really\r\nterminal in development.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 49. _Agrostis Spicaventi. c_, “seed,” nat.\r\nsize; _a_ and _b_, ditto, × about 9. The long slender awn is inserted\r\nbelow the bifid tip of the palea. Nobbe.]\r\n\r\nIn _Arundo_, _Cynosurus_ and some Fescues, where the palea tapers off\r\ninto a stiff long point, I have not spoken of it as an awn, but have\r\ndescribed the palea as tapering into a sharp point (awn-point). It\r\nmust be admitted that the distinction is somewhat artificial, but it\r\nhas its advantages in practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 50. _Bromus sterilis. a_, “seed,” nat. size; _b_\r\nand _c_, ditto, × about 2.

Fig. 78.]\r\n\r\nThe rachilla (Fig. 41), when present, often affords good characters,\r\nand in a few cases is relied on for the distinction of “seeds”\r\notherwise much alike--e.g. _Lolium perenne_ and _Festuca elatior_; and\r\nsimilarly with the presence or absence of hairs (_Digraphis_, _Arundo_,\r\n&c.) or “web” (_Poa_) at the base of the “seed.” (Figs. 55, 69.)\r\n\r\nOn germination the primary root of the embryo usually emerges and\r\nat once plunges into the soil, but soon ceases to grow, and the\r\nsecondary roots (and subsequently adventitious rootlets from the lower\r\ninternodes) soon give the peculiar fibrous character so well known in\r\ngrass-roots.\r\n\r\nThe plumule either pushes out from the same end of the caryopsis as\r\nthe root (e.g. Wheat, Rye) or drives its way between the coats to the\r\nopposite end (e.g. Barley) and appears as a pointed cylinder of rolled\r\nleaves (the “spear”) the outermost of which is sheath only, no lamina\r\nbeing developed. As Darwin showed, the pointed apex of such a plumule\r\nis hardened, facilitating the piercing of the soil above, and when the\r\nblade attains the open air it performs spiral movements during growth,\r\nindicating that similar attempts to rock from side to side have aided\r\nthe plumule in forcing its way through the soil. It has also been shown\r\nthat the apices of roots and plumules are sensitive to differences of\r\ntemperature, of light-intensity, moisture and contact, all of which aid\r\nthe seedling in establishing its position in the soil and in liberating\r\nthe “spear.” For particulars the student should read Darwin’s _Power of\r\nMovement in Plants_.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the established seedlings of grasses, many interesting\r\ndetails of structure are to be found in them. I have not sufficient\r\nmaterial to draw up a diagnostic arrangement of grass-seedlings, but it\r\nis evident that such could be done. It may be useful to illustrate this\r\nby the following tabular view of the characters of the larger seedlings\r\nof our common cereals, in part adapted from Vesque and Percival; though\r\nI find that some variations may occur, especially in the development of\r\nthe auricles.\r\n\r\n\r\nSEEDLINGS.\r\n\r\n  I. First expanded aerial leaves broad, bright green, with 18-24 ribs.\r\n\r\n     _Barley._\r\n\r\n  The blade tends to twist to the left: auricles, when well developed,\r\n  long, pointed, and claw-like, embracing the glabrous sheath in\r\n  front. Ligule long, membranous, pointed and irregularly toothed. The\r\n  plumule emerges at the upper end of the grain, and the embryo has 5-6\r\n  secondary roots.\r\n\r\n  II. First aerial leaves narrower, with not more than 11-13 ribs.\r\n\r\n      A. _Ligule long, rounded and toothed._\r\n\r\n         _Wheat._\r\n\r\n  The blade tends to twist to the left: auricles filiform and embrace\r\n  the densely pubescent sheath. Leaves green. Embryo with three roots.\r\n\r\n      B. _Ligule short and toothed. Leaves with a reddish cast._\r\n\r\n        (_a_) Blade and sheath softly hairy, the latter with scattered\r\n              long hairs, the former tending to twist to the left.\r\n\r\n               _Rye._\r\n\r\n  The first leaf-sheath purple. Auricle-claws more triangular and\r\n  smaller than those of wheat, and the accompanying bristles are fewer\r\n  and shorter. Embryonic roots four.\r\n\r\n        (_b_) Blade and sheath glabrous or merely ciliate or silky, the\r\n              former tending to twist to the right.\r\n\r\n              _Oat._\r\n\r\n  Auricles filiform. The plumule emerges above. The embryo has three\r\n  roots.\r\n\r\nA curious phenomenon is observed in some grasses growing in high\r\nlatitudes, or mountainous regions, or in moist situations. The\r\nflowers, or even entire spikelets, grow out into minute leafy buds,\r\nwith rudimentary roots at the base, and fall off like the bulbils\r\nof other monocotyledons, taking root directly in the damp soil.\r\nThe phenomenon must be looked upon as a case of apogamy, since the\r\ndevelopment of sexual organs is entirely passed over; the parts which\r\nwould normally have become ovary and stamens being transformed into\r\nleaves. In some species or varieties--e.g. _Poa alpina_, _Festuca\r\novina_--this viviparous condition may coexist with normal flowers\r\nand spikelets; in others--e.g. _Poa laxa_, var. _stricta_--only the\r\nviviparous state occurs.\r\n\r\nIn the following arrangement the student should note that the terms\r\n“Seed” and “Fruit” are used in the ordinary sense of the farmer and\r\nseedsman: by the former is meant the “seed” as it comes in samples\r\ninto the market, when the true fruit or grain (_Caryopsis_) is almost\r\ninvariably invested by adherent “chaff”--i.e. paleæ or glumes or\r\nboth. When the word Caryopsis is employed, I mean it strictly in the\r\nbotanical sense explained above. In _Hordeum_, for example, we never\r\nsee the true fruit, the grain consisting of the caryopsis with paleæ\r\nso closely adherent to it, that we are apt to take them as part of\r\nthe grain itself. The true seed, in the strict botanical sense, is\r\nnever seen as a naturally separate organ in our native grasses; and,\r\nas already explained, only very few exotic grasses ever shed it--e.g.\r\n_Sporobolus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF GRASSES BY THE “SEEDS” (GRAINS).\r\n\r\n\r\n  +I. “Seed” rounded (Millet-seed[12] type). Caryopsis ovoid or\r\n  sub-globose, devoid of distinct groove, and distending the awnless\r\n  paleæ, or falling out free.+\r\n\r\n    +A. Glumes cuspidate, “fruit” yellowish.+\r\n\r\n    _Phleum pratense._\r\n\r\nThe student should familiarise himself with the “seed” of _Phleum\r\npratense_, as a type, and an important grass easily obtained pure, but\r\nsometimes with minute round seeds of weeds intermixed.\r\n\r\n_Phleum pratense_, L. (Fig. 45).\r\n\r\nPalea 2·3 mm. long, five-ribbed, with a short point, delicate but hard,\r\nsmooth, with a silvery lustre. Inner pale two-nerved. Closely investing\r\nthe yellow-brown caryopsis, which easily falls out and is ovoid-acute,\r\nabout 2 mm. long by 1 broad, and finely punctate.\r\n\r\n  The much rarer _P. arenarium_ and the very rare _P. Bœhmeri_ and\r\n  _P. asperum_ also come here.\r\n\r\n  _Phleum_ is not easily confounded with any other of our grasses,\r\n  and _Briza_ and _Glyceria_ are almost the only other common grasses\r\n  of about the same size of which the caryopsis often falls free from\r\n  the palea (“naked fruits”). _Glyceria_ is longer and corn-shaped,\r\n  and _Briza_ usually larger. _Anthoxanthum_ and _Phalaris_ are easily\r\n  distinguished. _Agrostis_ is smaller and “corn-shaped.” Certain\r\n  species of _Panicum_ present resemblances, but the enveloping paleæ,\r\n  &c. are very different. _Melica_ also occurs as “naked fruits,” but\r\n  is rarely seen, and its colour and brilliant lustre distinguish it.\r\n\r\n    +B. Glumes not cuspidate. “Fruit” not yellow.+\r\n\r\n      (_a_) “Fruit” white, owing to the closely investing palea.\r\n\r\n             _Milium effusum._\r\n\r\n  A common grass, but not often met with in “seed” grasses. It is\r\n  eagerly eaten by birds.\r\n\r\n  _Milium effusum_, L. (Fig. 52).\r\n\r\nPalea about 3 mm. long, with few nerves, closely investing the\r\ncaryopsis: the seed is ellipsoid-acute, slightly compressed, and\r\n2·2-2·7 mm. long. The inner pale becomes hard and shines like porcelain.\r\n\r\n      (_b_) “Fruit” dark-brown shining; slightly flattened and grooved.\r\n\r\n            +Melica.+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 52. _Milium effusum._ “Seed,” _a_, nat. size; _b_\r\nand _c,_ × 7. Nobbe.]\r\n\r\n  _Melica_ is rarely met with as “seed.” When it is, it has to be\r\n  distinguished from the other “Millet-seed” types which readily fall\r\n  as naked fruits--see _Phleum_, _Milium_, &c. _Agrostis_, _Glyceria_\r\n  and other corn-shaped “seeds” are easily distinguished.\r\n\r\n  _Melica nutans_, L. (Fig. 53).\r\n\r\n“Seed” coracle-shaped. Palea broad, parchment-like, elliptic convex,\r\n5-6 mm. long, 5-7 nerved and keeled, awnless, loose, purplish.\r\nCaryopsis ellipsoid-acute, 2-3 mm. long, and easily separating,\r\nwrinkled, dark shining brown as if lacquered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 53.

Nobbe.]\r\n\r\n  _M. uniflora_, Retz. is commoner and very similar, but neither is\r\n  often met with in “seed” grass, except as impurities among Fescues.\r\n\r\n  The rare _Panicum Crus-galli_ and allies, and the rice-like _Leersia\r\n  oryzoides_ as well as _Cynodon Dactylon_, come here.\r\n\r\n  Panicums may occur in grass “seed” from America: Burchard describes\r\n  them in detail.\r\n\r\n  +II. “Seed” long (Corn and Barley type). Caryopsis oblong or\r\n       flattened, usually trapped between the boat-shaped paleæ: if\r\n       otherwise, with an awn.+\r\n\r\n    +A. “Seed” awnless. There may be a short sharp point to the palea\r\n        (mucronate), but no prominent hair-or bristle-awn exceeding half\r\n        the length of the palea.+\r\n\r\n      (_a_) A “web” or tuft of hairs at the base or on the rachilla.\r\n\r\n        (1) _Hairs of basal tuft silky and erect._\r\n\r\n          * Pencil of hairs as long as palea or longer.\r\n\r\n_Calamagrostis lanceolata_, Roth.\r\n\r\nPalea 3 mm. long, thin, two-toothed and with a short bristle at the\r\napex.\r\n\r\n  Other species of _Calamagrostis_ are awned. None occurs as an\r\n  ordinary impurity in “seed.”\r\n\r\n_Arundo Phragmites_, L.\r\n\r\nPalea narrow and long, 10-11 mm., delicate, entire, tapering to an\r\nacuminate point, violet, three-nerved, smooth. Caryopsis about 2 mm. A\r\npencil of long silky hairs on the rachilla.\r\n\r\n  The long acuminate point is almost an awn.\r\n\r\n  _Calamagrostis_ also has long basal hairs: both are useless grasses\r\n  agriculturally. For _Glyceria_ see note, p. 146. _Avena_, _Aira_ and\r\n  _Psamma_ are easily distinguished.\r\n\r\n          ** Pencil of hairs short.\r\n\r\n            † _Palea mucronate, 11-12 mm. long: caryopsis 4·5 mm._\r\n\r\n              _Psamma arenaria._\r\n\r\n  _Digraphis_ differs in the stout caryopsis, smaller size, double\r\n  hair-tuft. _Arundo_ has a long pointed palea and long silky basal\r\n  hairs and is larger.\r\n\r\n_Psamma arenaria_, Beauv.\r\n\r\nPalea 11·5 mm. ovate-lanceolate, papery, 4-5 nerved, as rolled round\r\nthe fruit about 1·3 mm. diameter, yellow, and with a small tuft of\r\nstiff fine hairs at the base. Mere trace of awn, sub-terminal. Fruit\r\n4-5 mm. long, obovate, pale-brown.\r\n\r\n  A shore-grass, not often seen as “seed”: more valuable as a\r\n  sand-binder than as fodder, though the young shoots are grazed.\r\n\r\n            †† _Palea acuminate, and only about 4 mm. long: caryopsis\r\n               1·4 mm._\r\n\r\n               _Digraphis arundinacea._\r\n\r\n  A Fen-grass, but coarse and not in use except the young growth, and\r\n  for thatching.\r\n\r\n_Digraphis arundinacea_, Trin.\r\n\r\nPaleæ ovate-lanceolate, nerveless and awnless, but silky with double\r\nbasal hair-tuft, and polished at the base; smooth, hard and shining,\r\nand closely investing the caryopsis which has no groove. Dark grey in\r\ncolour. The glumes are without awns or wings, and are left behind.\r\n\r\n  The allied _Phalaris canariensis_ has wing-like keels to the glumes.\r\n\r\n  _Triodia_ also comes into this group, with short basal hairs; but its\r\n  broad ciliate palea, 6 mm. long, has a short mucronate point between\r\n  two teeth (Fig. 40).\r\n\r\n        (2) _Hairs at the base forming a fluffy “web.” Paleæ thin,\r\n            2-3 mm. long._\r\n\r\n            _Poa pratensis._\r\n            _P. trivialis._\r\n            _P. compressa._\r\n            _P. nemoralis._\r\n\r\n  The “seeds” of _Poa_ proper are nearly all small--not more than 3-4\r\n  mm., more or less lanceolate, with tough, keeled glumes, and when\r\n  “webbed” tend to adhere together as if stuck with cobweb. The keeled\r\n  glumes give them an angular appearance--triangular in section--and\r\n  make them tend to lie on the side. Rachilla evident. Nerves of paleæ\r\n  distinct.\r\n\r\n_Poa pratensis_, L. (Fig. 55).\r\n\r\n“Seed” 2-3 mm. long, brownish: caryopsis about 1-1·5 mm.

In the other Bromes the palea is more\r\n  inrolled and the “seed” more slender as a rule.

HAMILTON ACTON, M.A. _Third edition._ Crown 8vo. With 45\r\n    illustrations. 4_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n_Nature._ The authors are much to be congratulated on their work, which\r\nfills a serious gap in the botanical literature of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +Morphology and Anthropology.+ By W.

With 333 illustrations. 15_s. net_.\r\n\r\n_Athenæum._ Mr Duckworth has managed to produce in his “Morphology and\r\nAnthropology” just such a text-book as students have long been asking\r\nfor.... It is no easy task to have undertaken such a work and the\r\nauthor is to be congratulated on the success which has attended his\r\nefforts. The volume can be confidently recommended to all whose studies\r\nlead them in this direction.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +Lectures on the History of Physiology+ during the Sixteenth,\r\n    Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries. By Sir M. FOSTER, K.C.B., M.D.,\r\n    D.C.L. Demy 8vo. With a frontispiece. 9_s._\r\n\r\n_Nature._ There is no more fascinating chapter in the history of\r\nscience than that which deals with physiology, but a concise and at\r\nthe same time compendious account of the early history of the subject\r\nhas never before been presented to the English reader. Physiologists\r\ntherefore owe a debt of gratitude to Sir Michael Foster for supplying\r\na want which was widely felt.... No higher praise can be given to the\r\nbook than to say that it is worthy of the reputation of its author.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +The Soluble Ferments and Fermentation.+ By J. REYNOLDS GREEN, Sc.D.,\r\n    F.R.S., Professor of Botany to the Pharmaceutical Society of Great\r\n    Britain. _Second edition._ Demy 8vo. 12_s._\r\n\r\n_Nature._ It is not necessary to recommend the perusal of the book to\r\nall interested in the subject since it is indispensable to them, and\r\nwe will merely conclude by congratulating the Cambridge University\r\nPress on having added to their admirable series of Natural Science\r\nManuals an eminently successful work on so important and difficult a\r\ntheme, and the author on having written a treatise cleverly conceived,\r\nindustriously and ably worked out, and on the whole, well written.\r\n\r\n  +Conditions of Life in the Sea.+ A short account of Quantitative\r\n    Marine Biological Research.

With 54\r\n    illustrations. 5_s. net_.\r\n\r\n_Nature._ An excellent book, written by a man who is equally in his\r\nelement whether he writes as an outdoor naturalist or as a laboratory\r\nstudent. This combination is by no means a common one, and it is just\r\nthe combination that is wanted for a book of this kind.... Altogether\r\nthe book is an admirable one.\r\n\r\n_Athenæum._ A book that may be judiciously placed in the hands of any\r\nboy who evinces a reasonable interest in the animal life around him.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +The Classification of Flowering Plants.+ By ALFRED BARTON RENDLE,\r\n    M.A. (Cantab.), D.Sc.

With 187 illustrations. 10_s._ 6_d._ net.\r\n\r\n_Gardener’s Chronicle._ Numerous illustrations and an excellent index\r\nadd to the value of the work. We heartily congratulate the author on\r\nthe partial accomplishment of a difficult and laborious task. The part\r\nbefore us does but whet our appetite for what is to follow.\r\n\r\n_Athenæum._ The first instalment of a text book which will well\r\nrepresent the state of our knowledge in the early years of the century.\r\nIn the present volume the Gymnosperms and the Monocotyledons alone are\r\ndealt with; but they are treated with such excellent co-ordination of\r\ndetail and such clear-headed sense of proportion, that we eagerly await\r\nthe publication of the next instalment.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +The Origin and Influence of the Thorough-bred Horse.+ By W.\r\n    RIDGEWAY, Sc.D., F.B.A., Disney Professor of Archæology and Fellow of\r\n    Gonville and Caius College. Demy 8vo. With 143 illustrations. 12_s._\r\n    6_d. net_.\r\n\r\n_Westminster Gazette._ There has never been a more learned contribution\r\nto equine literature than Professor Ridgeway’s comprehensive and\r\nexhaustive book.\r\n\r\n_Spectator._ It would be difficult for Professor Ridgeway to write\r\na book which did not contain at least one wholly novel thesis, and\r\nthe present work is no exception to his practice. It is also an\r\nencyclopaedia of information on the history of the _Equidae_, collected\r\nfrom every source, from post-Pleiocene deposits to modern sporting\r\nnewspapers. No detail escapes the author’s industry, and ... the result\r\nis a monument of sound learning, unique of its kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +Manual of Practical Morbid Anatomy+, being a Handbook for the\r\n    Post-mortem Room.

Vol. II. with a frontispiece and 265\r\n    illustrations. 15_s. net_.\r\n\r\n  [Vol. III in the Press.\r\n\r\n_Revue Scientifique._ Nous ne pouvons entrer dans le détail; mais il\r\nest évident que M. Seward, praticien distingué lui-même, est très au\r\ncourant des travaux des autres, il les cite et utilise abondamment;\r\net ceci est fait pour inspirer confiance. Au total, son œuvre est\r\nappuyée sur des bases solides, et elle restera sans doute longtemps le\r\nbréviaire, le manuel de ceux qui veulent, non pas seulement s’initier\r\nà la paléobotanique, mais retrouver les renseignements qui sont épars\r\ndans des centaines de monographies qu’on a souvent peine à se procurer.\r\nLe livre de M. Seward fait partie des _Cambridge Natural Science\r\nManuals_, et il est digne de cette collection, qui est elle-même digne\r\ndu foyer scientifique universellement réputé, où il a vu le jour.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +Zoology. An Elementary Text-Book.+ By A. E. SHIPLEY, Sc.D., F.R.S.,\r\n    and E. W. MACBRIDE, M.A. (Cantab.), D.Sc. (London). _Second edition._\r\n    Demy 8vo. With 349 illustrations. 10_s._ 6_d. net_.\r\n\r\n_Pall Mall Gazette._ Precisely the sort of book which, if it came\r\ninto a thoughtful boy’s hands, would turn him from a smatterer into a\r\nstudent.... One of the most instructive and attractive books that could\r\nbe put into the hands of a young naturalist.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +Trees+: A Handbook of Forest Botany for the Woodlands and the\r\n    Laboratory. By H. MARSHALL WARD, Sc.D., F.R.S. Vol. I. Buds and\r\n    Twigs. Vol. II. Leaves. Vol. III. Flowers and Inflorescences. Vol.\r\n    IV. Fruits. Vol. V. Form and Habit, with an Appendix on Seedlings.\r\n    Crown 8vo. With numerous illustrations. 4_s._ 6_d. net each_. Price\r\n    for the set of five volumes, 20_s. net_.\r\n\r\n_Nature._ The clear and simple way in which the author treats the\r\nsubject is sure to inspire many with interest and enthusiasm for the\r\nstudy of forest botany.... The work will be found indispensable to\r\nthose students who wish to make an expert study of forest botany.\r\nAt the same time it is expressed in language so clear and devoid of\r\ntechnicalities that the amateur who wishes to know something about\r\nour trees and shrubs will find this one of the most useful guides to\r\nwhich he can turn.... The work is a many sided one, acting not only\r\nas a guide to the naturalist in the field, but also as a laboratory\r\nhandbook, where the use of the lens and microscope may be employed\r\nto amplify the study of objects already observed in their natural\r\nhabitats. Botanists generally, and especially forest botanists will\r\nwelcome the appearance of this book as supplying a decided want, and\r\nfilling a distinct gap in our literature of forest botany.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +Grasses+: a Handbook for use in the Field and Laboratory. By H.\r\n    MARSHALL WARD, Sc.D., F.R.S. Crown 8vo. With 81 figures. 6_s._\r\n\r\n_Field._ The work is essentially suited to the requirements of those\r\ndesirous of studying the grasses commonly grown in this country, and it\r\ncan fairly be said that it furnishes an amount of information seldom\r\nobtained in more pretentious volumes.\r\n\r\n  P. T. O.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +A Treatise on the British Freshwater Algæ.+ By G. S. WEST, M.A.,\r\n    A.R.C.S., F.L.S., Lecturer in Botany in the University of Birmingham.\r\n    Demy 8vo. With a frontispiece and 166 illustrations. 10_s._ 6_d._\r\n    _net_.\r\n\r\n_Nature._ Its aim is stated as “to give the student a concise account\r\nof the structure, habits and life-histories of Freshwater Algæ, and\r\nalso to enable him to place within the prescribed limits of a genus\r\nany Algæ he may find in the freshwater of the British Islands.” To do\r\nthis within the limits of an octavo volume of less than 400 pages, in\r\nwhich are numerous illustrations, is a task possible of accomplishment\r\nonly by one very familiar with the subject and skilled in concise\r\nexpression; but that it has been successfully done will, we think,\r\nbe the verdict after testing the book thoroughly.... Prof. West’s\r\ntreatment of his subject is instructive and stimulating.\r\n\r\n  +A Manual and Dictionary of the Flowering Plants and Ferns.+ By J. C.\r\n    WILLIS, M.A., Sc.D., Director of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Ceylon.\r\n    _Third edition._ Crown 8vo. 10_s._ 6_d._\r\n\r\n_Field._ Taking this handy volume and a local flora, the traveller\r\nor student may do an enormous amount of practical field work without\r\nany other botanical literature whatever.... The result is a work that\r\nought to be included in every library of botany and horticulture or\r\nagriculture, and it is certainly one that the nomadic botanist cannot\r\nafford to leave at home.... We have used the original edition of this\r\nwork since its publication, and have found it to be one of the most\r\nuseful and comprehensive works on plants ever produced.\r\n\r\n_Athenæum._ The whole is well abreast of modern research, and a\r\nthoroughly business-like volume, lucid though compact.\r\n\r\n\r\n  +Agriculture in the Tropics.+ An elementary Treatise. By J. C.\r\n    WILLIS, M.A., Sc.D. Demy 8vo.
