W. S. CLEVELAND.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF A SITE FOR A PARK.\r\n\r\nBY H. W. S. CLEVELAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew persons think of a park as anything but a place of recreation, a\r\npleasure ground, and an ornamental appendage of a city.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, if it is proposed to create a park in any city, every\r\nsuggestion that is offered in regard to its location is based upon the\r\nfact of its superior natural advantages; its picturesque character; its\r\ncommand of fine views, or the features of attractive interest it\r\ncombines.\r\n\r\nWithout denying the value of any of these elements, I wish to call\r\nattention to other objects which are rarely thought of, and yet are\r\ndeserving of careful consideration in determining the location.\r\n\r\nAlmost every city comprises within its limits some portion of territory\r\nwhich is not adapted for business purposes, and is not attractive to\r\nthat class of inhabitants who can afford to choose the location of their\r\nresidences. Such localities are at first left vacant, but as population\r\nincreases they are occupied first by squatters, then by those who can\r\nafford nothing better, and finally become the site of tenement houses,\r\nor dens of resort for the worst class of human beings, male and female,\r\nthat the city contains.\r\n\r\nThe original cause of the avoidance of the place may have been that it\r\nwas low and subject to malarial influences, or of such topographical\r\ncharacter that it could only be adapted to residence purposes at very\r\ngreat cost.\r\n\r\nIn either of these cases it is obvious that the first cost of the land\r\nwill be far less than that of a tract combining all the features which\r\nrender it most attractive as a site for residences. Let us now consider\r\nsome of the effects of improving such sites:\r\n\r\nSuppose the area to be low and wet, an unsightly tract, suggestive of\r\nchills and fever, and too extensive for improvement by its individual\r\nowners. Instead of suffering it to become the plague spot and breeding\r\nplace of moral and physical diseases, as it certainly will if left to\r\nitself, let the city purchase and improve it as a park, first, by\r\nthorough drainage, and then by such artistic arrangement as shall make\r\nit an attractive resort, and it is obvious that the result will be not\r\nonly the securing of a charming place of recreation and ornament to the\r\ncity, but the conversion of a threatening danger to health, into a chief\r\nsource of its promotion. The creation of such an improvement also\r\ninvariably changes the character of its surroundings by rendering them\r\ndesirable as residence sites, and thus repaying the cost by the\r\nincreased taxable value of adjacent property. It often happens, however,\r\nthat large areas are comprised within, or adjacent to, a city, which\r\neven if unobjectionable on the score of health are not available for\r\nresidence on account of their topographical character.\r\n\r\nThe site of the New York Central Park affords an illustration of my\r\nmeaning:\r\n\r\nAt the time of its first inception in 1857—the whole of that section of\r\nthe city was a series of barren ledges of rocks of such forbidding\r\nnature that no individual proprietor could afford the expense of\r\npreparing an area for residence and providing himself with the simplest\r\nnecessities of comfort. The land had only a nominal value, and its only\r\noccupants\r\n\r\n(_Continued on Page 73._)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFRESH MEAT FOR THE FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest banes to the proper enjoyment of country life is the\r\nalmost constant use of salt meats. It is ham for breakfast, salty, oh,\r\nhow salty! Then for dinner it is salt pork, boiled or fried. Then for\r\nsupper a cold slice of ham, or boiled cold shoulder, varied a little by\r\nchipped dried beef, which is within itself a “piller of salt.” Then it\r\nis drink, drink, from morning to night without abatement.\r\n\r\nNow, I know the great difficulties that lay in the way of a farmer,\r\nlocated miles from city or town, to procure a daily supply of fresh meat\r\nfrom the markets, to say nothing of the unbearable cost of such a\r\nproceeding to those who live close enough to market to procure a daily\r\nsupply. Just think of it; we sell our beef cattle to the butcher for,\r\nsay three cents on foot, and pay for the article on the hook from twelve\r\nand a half to twenty cents per pound, and our mutton and pork in the\r\nsame ratio. It is not my purpose, in this article, to show the relative\r\nlosses and profits in these transactions, but to show my brother farmers\r\nhow they can have fresh meat on their tables every day of the year, and\r\nevery meal of each day if they will, and that at their own first cost\r\nprices. This plan of mine is not new; yet, I am safe in saying that it\r\nis not practiced by one per cent of the farmers in the nation. Why is\r\nthis? Ignorance of the way to do it. It can be nothing else. For there\r\nis less labor and work attending the process of preserving the meats put\r\nup for home consumption, by keeping them fresh, than there is by\r\nsalting, smoking, wrapping in canvas, and packing away, as now\r\npracticed. A second great advantage is, that the curing of meats in a\r\nfresh state can be accomplished at any season of the year, no matter how\r\nhot, and that without ice.\r\n\r\nThen, a third consideration is the saving of labor to the farmer’s\r\nfamily during the hot sweltering summer months, in fact, all through the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nTo enable any person to understand the matter, I will explain by briefly\r\nstating what we are now doing in the way of preparing our fresh meat for\r\nnext summer’s use. In the first place, we have as many lard or pork\r\nbarrels as will be necessary to hold a supply of meat for the family.\r\nThese barrels are clean, sweet, and tight, one end taken out. They are\r\narranged on a bench in the cellar, open end up. The pigs are killed and\r\ncooled in the usual way. When the animal heat is all out they are cut\r\nup, cutting off the sausage and lard, the lard cut up ready to be\r\nrendered out. The shoulders and sides are then cut up into such sized\r\npieces as may be convenient for table use. These pieces are washed\r\ncleanly, and boiled in large kettles, seasoned with salt and pepper to\r\nmake palatable, and when sufficiently boiled for table use they are\r\nplaced in a barrel closely together, but not pressed or mashed, thus\r\nleaving each piece as near in the shape cut as possible. When the barrel\r\nis filled within two inches of the top, we then pour in warm lard until\r\nall the crevices between the pieces of meat are filled up, covering the\r\ntop with one or two inches of the warm lard. Next day we find that the\r\nlard has settled down; we fill up again to the top and keep filled until\r\nall has become a solid mass of meat and lard. This is the whole secret.\r\nYou can fill any tight vessel from a one gallon jar to a forty-five\r\ngallon barrel in like manner, and if properly done, and kept in a cool\r\nplace the meat will keep fresh and sweet the year round.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this process of keeping meat are manifold. You can\r\nkill a fat hog at any season of the year, and its own fat can preserve\r\nit, and the fat can be used for culinary purposes just the same as when\r\nput up in cans for home use. The shoulders can be thus prepared, and\r\nwhen cold are far superior to salt meat, even after being boiled. The\r\nsides when cut in square pieces, with the ribs on, are just as good as\r\nwhen cooked fresh in the fall of the year. Hams, whole, when well cooked\r\nand seasoned, retain all their sweetness, and that without being\r\nimpaired by the excess of salt necessary to keep them. Then, there is no\r\ntrouble with flies, bugs, or skippers; the meat remains sweet,\r\nwholesome, and palatable until the last piece is taken from the bottom.\r\nAll the care necessary in taking the pieces from the barrel is to press\r\nthe lard down closely over what is left, and thus exclude the air.\r\n\r\nThere are two great advantages in this mode of keeping meat; one is, it\r\nis fresh, easily digested, and consequently more healthy, and decidedly\r\nmore pleasant to the taste; and it does not create that burning thirst\r\nthat is so hard to quench on a hot harvest day. Then it is always ready\r\nfor table use, and that without requiring your wives, daughters, and\r\nhouse help to melt over a hot stove when the mercury is up among the\r\nnineties, a no small saving in threshing time.\r\n\r\nThe only great drawback that I have found to this plan is, that I can\r\neat twice the amount that I can of salted meats; and, therefore, it\r\nrequires double the quantity for family use than under the salting\r\nprocess; but I am persuaded that the difference is made up in better\r\nhealth, and smaller doctor bills. Try it on a small scale, and you will\r\nalways follow it.\r\n\r\n    A. R.\r\n        CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFARMERS’ COMMUNICATIVE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI am now fifty-five years old and have always lived in a good\r\nagricultural country. Having had no rich friends to draw on for supplies\r\nI have had to look to Mother Earth for my living. Hence I feel that I\r\nshould pay homage to the Great Creator of all things for that fair\r\ncapacity which has enabled me to select good lands and grow crops well\r\nadapted to the soils.\r\n\r\nWhile my work has been arduous in the main, I have not felt it drudgery.\r\nIn fact, my farm has not only furnished me a good living, but in its\r\nproductions and developments I have been highly entertained.\r\n\r\nI am not different from most of my fellowmen. I like to manage and\r\ndictate, and have my own way. I manage so as to bring my lands into\r\nsubjection. I do it by making them better. I cultivate and dress them\r\nuntil they look better and feel better, and I know they are better.\r\n\r\nWhen I plant my crops I give them such attention that it seems they have\r\nevery confidence that I will remove all obstructions to hinder their\r\ngrowth, and the young and tender plants seem to avail themselves of the\r\nsituation and spring up as by magic. In their prosperity I rejoice.\r\n\r\nI take a half dozen farm journals and a few newspapers so as to learn\r\nwhat others are doing without going from my home, especially in the\r\nwinter season. For I find that when I go from home I can’t always get\r\ndelicious fruits and vegetables that I have learned to be so fond of in\r\nmy riper years.\r\n\r\nNow I come to a point where I will venture a proposition to my brother\r\nfarmers: That we organize a—well I don’t know just what to name it, but\r\nsay Farmers Communicative Society. I mean by this that we select some\r\nfarm journal that seems most fitting and send in our names and\r\naddresses, agreeing to write once a month a short and candid statement\r\nof our plans and successes and failures in our agricultural and\r\nhorticultural pursuits. I am of course intending to get the best of the\r\nbargain as I always try to do in business. But it must be apparent to\r\nall that we, as farmers, can be more benefited by commingling our\r\ninterests together in the developments of the farm, and learn from one\r\nanother in a few years what it will take each one of us a whole life\r\ntime to learn in case we continue to “go it alone” as in olden times.\r\n\r\nNow Mr. Editor, I think you can afford to second the motion to help\r\norganize these practical old farmers and get them to write for your\r\njournal. I feel that we can give your readers many practical ideas of\r\nbenefit to all, and you agree to clothe our crude thoughts and make them\r\nappear intelligent before the public, so that no one need be embarrassed\r\nto “speak out in meetin’.”\r\n\r\nNow the benefits to be derived from an association to communicate\r\nthrough the paper are to my mind much greater than from conventions. All\r\nadmit that farmers’ conventions have accomplished great good in the\r\ndifferent interests, and that they are indispensable. I am indebted to\r\nthese conventions for much of my success in farm life. But I conclude\r\nthat as great good, or even greater good, can be accomplished at much\r\nless cost. For a few hundred farmers can communicate to each other\r\nthrough a good farm paper like THE PRAIRIE FARMER, so paged that it can\r\nbe filed for future reference, and we can, as it were, have our meetings\r\nevery week at our homes and with our families, and impress the lessons\r\nupon our children’s tender minds so they will not have to wait until\r\nthey are of mature age before hearing discussions as to the best modes\r\npracticed in agriculture and horticulture. I have felt in attending\r\nthese conventions like asking those old veterans who must soon pass\r\naway, where are the young men of our country? For very few seem to\r\nattend these interesting gatherings.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why I suggest we adopt THE PRAIRIE FARMER is, that THE\r\nPRAIRIE FARMER COMPANY sends to each of their patrons a large map of the\r\nUnited States, which would enable us to know the exact locality of\r\nparties giving useful information, which is always more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nNow I am always trying new things and looking after new industries, and\r\nI have made a great many observations, some of which I shall promise to\r\ngive in farmers’ communications, in case we can get a fair start so as\r\nto get others to give me their observations, for that is my prime\r\nobject, as I stated in the outset. I am like my Irish friend “I want a\r\nlittle more than I give.” I am developing our sweets in Kansas. I have\r\nalso the finest fruits of the land and succeeded in both, and I will\r\ntell how I did it.\r\n\r\n    J. H. W.\r\n        POMONA, KAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOTANY FOR FARM BOYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis time I would like to call your attention to the subject of botany.\r\nIt might seem rather odd at this time of year, but you know that the\r\nfarmers have more time now than in summer to read THE PRAIRIE FARMER. It\r\nis better for the farmer’s boys to become acquainted with the laws of\r\nnature than to spend their time in reading novels, or other books, which\r\nbring them little information. A little knowledge of the nature of\r\nplants is worth infinitely more to the farmer’s son or daughter, or even\r\nto the farmer himself, because it has special relation to his calling.\r\nAnd in order to obtain a practical knowledge it is best to study the\r\nplants themselves, their structure, their habitat and peculiarity of\r\ngrowth, etc., and in order to do so, it is best to have some apparatus\r\nfor the purpose, requisite for the accomplishment of this object.\r\n\r\nThe student in botanical science should give early and persevering\r\nattention to the collection and preservation of specimens of as many\r\nspecies of plants as he can procure. The advantages to be derived from\r\nsuch collections, either in refreshing the memory by reviewing them, or\r\nin instituting a more thorough examination at one’s leisure, are such as\r\nwill afford an abundant compensation for all the labor requisite in\r\npreparing them. Such a collection of dried specimens of plants is called\r\nan herbarium, or by the more significant title, hortus siccus (dry\r\ngarden).\r\n\r\nThe apparatus requisite for the accomplishment of this object is, first,\r\na close tin box, twenty inches in length, and of a portable form;\r\nsecond, a portable press, consisting of two boards of light material,\r\ntwelve by eighteen inches, opening and shutting by hinges, like the\r\ncover of a book, and secured by springs (even a large book is a good\r\nsubstitute); third, a quantity of smooth, bibulous paper, of large size\r\n(a dozen or more quires of printing paper); fourth, eight or ten boards\r\nof the same size as the paper; fifth, a small screw press, or several\r\nlead weights of various sizes, from fifteen to thirty pounds each.\r\n\r\nIn gathering plants for this purpose, or specimens, as they are called,\r\nthe smaller and herbaceous plants should be taken up with a portion of\r\nthe roots, while from larger plants there should be selected a shoot,\r\nwith complete representations of the leaves and flowers. They may be\r\npreserved for several days, without withering, in the tin box, or they\r\nmay at once be laid between several thicknesses of the paper and\r\ninclosed in the portable press. It is always desirable that they be\r\ngathered on a dry day; if not they should be freed from dampness before\r\nbeing committed to the paper and press.\r\n\r\nIn drying the specimens, great care is required, that they may preserve\r\nwell their natural appearance, form, and color. It is generally\r\nrecommended that they be carefully spread out, as nearly in their\r\nnatural position as possible, between eight or ten thicknesses of paper,\r\nand then submitted to pressure between the boards. The degree of\r\npressure should never be such as to crush their parts, and may be easily\r\nregulated by the screw, or by the number and size of the weights used.\r\nCotton-batting may be used to equalize the pressure.\r\n\r\nAs often as once a day they should be taken from the press, transferred\r\nto fresh and dry paper, and returned, until they are thoroughly dried,\r\nwhen they are ready to be transferred to the cabinet. The true secret of\r\npreserving specimens with all their colors is to extract the moisture\r\nfrom them by pressure in an abundance of dry, bibulous paper as soon as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe next object with the collector is the arrangement of his specimens.\r\nFor this purpose each one is first to be fastened to a sheet of firm\r\nwhite paper, about ten by eighteen inches, either by glue or with loops\r\nof paper of the same kind, or they may be stitched to the paper with a\r\nfine needle. The latter mode, if done skillfully, is preferable. Then\r\nlet all those specimens which belong to the same genus be collected\r\ntogether and placed within a folded sheet of colored paper, with the\r\nname of the genus and each species written on the outside. Each sheet\r\nshould also be labeled with the names of the plants, the locality, time\r\nof gathering, habits, etc., etc.\r\n\r\nThe genera are next to be collected together into orders, each order\r\nbeing wrapped or folded in a still larger sheet, of a different color\r\nfrom that which enfolds the genera, having the name of the order with a\r\ncatalogue of its genera on the outside. Thus arranged, the orders are to\r\nbe laid away upon the shelves of a cabinet, or packed in a chest. To\r\nprotect the plants from the attack of insects pieces of camphor gum are\r\nto be laid among them, or a piece of sponge saturated with the oil of\r\nturpentine. To save them from decay they should be kept dry and well\r\nventilated.\r\n\r\nFruits and seeds which are too large to be pressed with the plants, and\r\nalso truncheons of wood, are to be pressed separately in a cabinet. In\r\nthe above I have closely followed the directions of Professor Wood in\r\nhis excellent work on Botany, which would prove a profitable pastime for\r\nthose desiring to improve their knowledge in this direction.\r\n\r\n    H. A. P. WESSBERGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIOGENES IN HIS TUB.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiogenes in this desires to call the attention of all readers of THE\r\nPRAIRIE FARMER to what he deems a very important subject and a great\r\nwrong—one to which they have heretofore seemed strangely indifferent.\r\n\r\nThe papers teem of late years with accounts of sharks passing about\r\namong farmers and others, and under various pretences, obtaining their\r\nsignatures to documents, innocent in themselves—but which eventually\r\nturn up as notes of hand in possession of third persons. And the result\r\n(it is always so stated) is, that the note is collectable and has to be\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nAnd the papers with one voice unite in warning their readers against\r\nusing their signature in such a way.\r\n\r\nNow, Messrs. Editors, and fellow readers, is it possible that there is\r\nsuch a principle in our laws—common or statute—that makes such a thing\r\npossible; that legalizes such a fraud? If so, it is not only unsafe for\r\na man to sign a contract of any sort, but to write a letter to a friend.\r\nAnd while I am loth to believe there is any statute justifying it, I\r\nfeel sure there is no common law principle that will sustain it; or if\r\nthere is, it is a relic of barbarism that common sense and common\r\njustice ought long since to have swept into oblivion.\r\n\r\nThe theory seems to be acquiesced in on the ground that innocent parties\r\nmust not be made to suffer. But this theory will not hold good.\r\nThousands of cases occur in which innocent persons do, and are compelled\r\nby law and by right as well, to suffer loss from just such frauds. A\r\nrogue may steal or borrow my horse and sell him to a neighbor, who buys\r\nin good faith. The law, and right and justice, instead of compelling me\r\nto lose my animal, permits me to replevy him and take him home, and my\r\nneighbor pockets his loss. And this is done daily over the land without\r\nobjection; and we hear no newspaper cautions to the “gullible” farmers\r\nnot to lend horses. So with every other species of property; one can\r\ntake his own legally wherever he may find it—in the hands of a rogue or\r\nof an innocent purchaser.\r\n\r\nIt is strange to me that this thing has been permitted to go on so long\r\nunchallenged. I do not know whether the courts have ever sustained such\r\na principle; if they have, unless there be much more cogent reason for\r\nit than I can conceive of, the sooner it is reversed the better for\r\nhonest men and good government. Will you allow me, through your widely\r\nread pages, to earnestly call the attention of your readers to the\r\nsubject matter—and not only your readers, but your cotemporaries of the\r\nagricultural press as well. Let the principle be ventilated.\r\n\r\n    DIOGENES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW HE LIKES DAKOTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn passing through Chicago last spring on my way to Dakota, I called at\r\nyour office and paid for THE PRAIRIE FARMER. The gentleman in the office\r\nrequested me to write you about Dakota. I have delayed doing so until\r\nnow to learn about the winters here, and as it is now on hand, I write.\r\n\r\nThe last half of December and the first half of January we had the cold\r\nwave, the mercury going below zero from 8 to 40 deg. We have from six to\r\nseven inches of snow on the level. Thermometer now ranging from 10 below\r\nto 20 above. We have had some windy days that make the snow fly. I was\r\nin Illinois before leaving for Dakota some forty-five years, and I did\r\nnot in all that time see a more pleasant winter; but a very few days\r\nthat a man could not be at work if he choose. The wind is no harder nor\r\nmore frequent than in Illinois—just the same as near as could be made.\r\nNow for the land, etc.:\r\n\r\nHere in Brown county, about twelve to fifteen miles from the 46 parallel\r\n(south) the land is nicely rolling, just about as any one would wish.\r\nThere is very little choice in location, only as distance from railway\r\nstations. The soil is black sandy loam, good for small grain, and,\r\njudging from experiment in sod corn, we can raise corn and a good crop\r\nmature if put in in good season, and of an early variety.\r\n\r\nI never say anything against Illinois. It is good enough, and Dakota is\r\njust as good, and in one-quarter of the time that Illinois was in\r\ndeveloping, Dakota will be up even with her, the facilities being far in\r\nadvance of those of early Illinois. Then we had to team all of our wheat\r\ninto Chicago by wagon for nearly twenty years before we had a canal or\r\nrailroad. But here we have the railroads to start with, and if\r\nemigration is as large next spring as it was the last there will not be\r\na foot of land to be located. There is not a quarter section left now in\r\nBrown county, unless it has been overlooked. Towns are growing up as\r\nfast as toad-stools in summer. We are located six miles from Frederick\r\n(600 inhabitants), seven miles from West Port (200), ten miles from\r\nOrdway (500), twenty miles from Aberdeen (2,000), twenty from Columbia\r\n(1,000), county seat. The land is watered about the same as Illinois,\r\nwith the elm and maple along the Jim river. For wells we dig from\r\ntwenty-five to forty feet and get the best of water.\r\n\r\nI think Dakota as good a place for a young man of small means as can be\r\nfound. There are some counties where the land has not been surveyed yet,\r\nwhere good location may be made. Our crops were short last year in Brown\r\ncounty, caused by a short time of dry weather in June, just as the wheat\r\nand oats were in blossom, at which time these crops require rain in\r\norder to “fill” well.\r\n\r\nThe only drawback we have is in the matter of fuel as yet. Soft coal\r\nsells at from $7 to $8 per ton: hard, $12 to $13. Dry-goods and\r\ngroceries are as low as in Illinois. Lumber from $2 to $4 higher. Our\r\nvegetables can not be beaten.\r\n\r\nJust a thing or two more. I want to ask you what are the best kinds of\r\ntimber for us to put out on our tree claims. Will the black walnuts,\r\nblack and white oaks do well as far north as we are? How will the Scotch\r\nand Norway pines do? I wish to put out such timber as will make good\r\nlumber when grown.

This is\r\ndifferent from my limited experience; I have used lake salt at the rate\r\nof one ton to the acre and did not kill either weeds or asparagus. I am\r\nnow making arrangements to use about three and one-half tons to the acre\r\nfrom the refuse of pork packing houses.\r\n\r\nWill Mr. Earle please give particulars in THE PRAIRIE FARMER: The kind\r\nof salt, time of year it was used, amount per acre, nature of soil,\r\netc. By so doing he will confer a favor on many readers.\r\n\r\n    S. P.\r\n        TERRE HAUTE, IND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOVEN PALING FENCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Washington firm of patent solicitors write us, as we suppose they have\r\nall the agricultural papers, warning readers against persons claiming of\r\nthem a fee of $500 and upwards for alleged infringements of a patent\r\nupon a so-called “Wire and Picket Fence.” Our informants say that, “It\r\nis quite true that there are a number of patents for wire and picket\r\nfences, or so-called ‘woven paling fences,’ but all these patents are\r\nlimited in their claims to the detailed construction of the woven fence,\r\nand there is no broad patent on this class of fence. Indeed it was\r\ninvented as long ago as 1829, when Chauncy Hall, of Meriden, Ct., on\r\nNovember 27th, of that year, obtained the first patent for a wire and\r\npaling fence. All recent applications for patents which have endeavored\r\nto claim the woven fence broadly have been rejected, as we find by an\r\nexamination of the records of the United States Patent Office, on the\r\nold patent to James Moore, of Pittsburg, Pa., for a woven picket fence,\r\nwhich was granted June 30, 1857, and therefore, expired in 1871, so that\r\nit is now public property. There is another patent of the same year\r\ngranted to J. B. Reyman, of Bloomington, Ill., No. 18,301, dated\r\nSeptember 29, 1857, which, also, shows a paling and wire fence, or\r\npicket and wire fence. This patent has, also, been frequently cited as a\r\nreference against applications of subsequent patentees who endeavor to\r\nclaim broadly the invention of the combined wire and picket fence. In\r\n1849, one, Lucius Leavenworth, obtained a patent for a method of\r\nconstructing a fence by fastening pickets or palings upon the wires by\r\nmeans of a series of links formed on the connecting wires and adapted to\r\nreceive or hold the pickets or palings. All of these patents have long\r\nago expired, and are now public property, so that no person can claim to\r\nhave a broad patent on the, so-called, woven picket fence, and any man\r\nwho, by virtue of a pretended claim covering broadly that class of\r\nfences, asserts such a right may be put down as an impostor, and should\r\nreceive treatment as such. Of late years a number of patents have been\r\ngranted for this class of fences, but, as soon stated, the claims of all\r\nthese patents are confined to the detailed construction of the fence,\r\ni.e., the precise weaving of the pickets between the wires. A number of\r\nmachines have, also, been patented for constructing this kind of fence,\r\none of the first being that which was patented by Fletcher on Nov. 17,\r\n1868.”\r\n\r\nWe have heard of no trouble from these patent agents in the West, but\r\ngive our readers for what it is worth the information vouchsafed by the\r\nWashington firm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLINOIS STATE FAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis fair, as we have before announced, begins at Chicago on the 8th of\r\nSeptember.

Very little cold\r\nweather. Wheat and rye looking fine, and very large acreage sown the\r\npast season. Stock doing finely; but little fodder used as yet. In about\r\nten days plowing will begin.\r\n\r\nWe need more settlers of energy and thrift to fill up the large scope of\r\nunoccupied lands. No homestead lands here but plenty railroad lands yet\r\nfor sale. The price ranges from $4 to $8 per acre on long time, with a\r\ndiscount for cash or short time.\r\n\r\nWe have good water and grass, and plenty of the finest limestone\r\nbuilding rock.\r\n\r\nThis is a good place for a man of small means to get a home.

A. Armstrong reports that all the kinds of commercial\r\nfertilizers applied to the alluvial soils cultivated by members of the\r\nElmira Club proved in every instance to be “practically worthless.” The\r\nbest that can be said is that “some of them used on uplands in which\r\nclay is a constituent, have fair probability, at least, of yielding\r\nsatisfactory returns.”\r\n\r\nAt the Mississippi Valley Cane-Growers’ meeting at St. Louis, delegates\r\nfrom Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska, and Michigan gave their\r\nexperiences in growing cane and making sirups. In Illinois, Kansas, and\r\nNebraska good results were generally obtained, but the season was bad in\r\nother States and expectations were not realized. All concurred, however,\r\nin the belief that the cultivation of sorghum was a good thing, and\r\nwould yield handsome profits.\r\n\r\nThe New York Tribune: The animated discussion of the subject at the\r\nrecent meeting of the Connecticut Board was unfavorable to ensilage.\r\nExhibition of a sample of clover put in a silo when wet called out the\r\nquery whether it was fed to cows to make Limburger cheese. One reporter\r\nsays it “fairly howled” through the City Hall, echoing and reverberating\r\na fearful smell. President James A. Bell, of the State Agricultural\r\nSociety, is quoted as declaring that the free talk of the occasion “will\r\nsave the farmers thousands of dollars by keeping them out of the silo\r\nsystem.”\r\n\r\nAt which end should a hoe-handle be the larger? At which end should a\r\npitch-fork be the larger? It is not every farmer that thinks of these\r\nthings until his attention is called to them. As Mr. J. J. Thomas\r\nremarks, the laborer who makes with a common hoe 2,000 strokes every\r\nhour should not wield a needless ounce. If any part is heavier than\r\nneeded even to the amount of half an ounce only, he must lift this\r\nneedless half ounce 2,000 times every hour. A hoe-handle should be\r\nsmallest near the hoe and largest near the other end; a pitch-fork\r\nhandle the reverse. Oughtn’t it?\r\n\r\nA member of the Oxford (Ohio) Farmers’ Club recently said: We know\r\nsomething how soil was made, if we do not know much. The soils in the\r\nforests and untilled lands are better than they were a century ago, or\r\nin the days of our fathers; but, alas, it is not so with the soils man\r\nhas cultivated. He thinks the term “cultivating” means to improve, make\r\nbetter. We may make our soils better, but so few do that that we ought\r\nnever to use the term “cultivating the soil.” We harass, and torture,\r\nand murder, and starve the soil. By withholding more than is meet we rob\r\nour best friend.\r\n\r\nNew York Times: Tobacco is a universal insecticide. It kills ticks upon\r\nsheep; the troublesome scab insect; its related species which produces\r\nmange and itch; lice, fleas, and all other insect parasites which infest\r\nand annoy animals; and root-lice, leaf-lice, and all other pests which\r\ninjure plants. Just at this season an application of fine tobacco dust\r\nor snuff may be used effectively to relieve calves and fowls from the\r\nvermin which keeps them poor and wretched, and a decoction of tobacco,\r\napplied to house or greenhouse plants with a brush, will destroy the\r\npestiferous green fly and all other insects which infest them. The same\r\nliquid may also be poured around the roots of house plants that are\r\ninfested with the small white worms which are the larvæ of a small black\r\nfly that may be found in the pots and upon the soil in them.\r\n\r\nThe town of Amenia, in Dutchess county, N. Y., has tried, with marked\r\nsuccess, the plan of keeping a force of four or five men at work on\r\nhighways through most of the year under the supervision of an\r\nexperienced and skillful builder of roads, who gives his attention\r\nconstantly to the work. Every part of the seventy-five miles of highway\r\nin the town is in good condition, and the expense of keeping it so has\r\nbeen much less than it could have been by the old method. The new plan\r\nhas greatly relieved the farmers, who have not been called to work on\r\nthe roads at a time when other duties demanded their attention. New York\r\nhas a law which directs that the voters of any town may elect to adopt\r\nthis plan of hiring a force of men and a competent commissioner to make\r\nand keep in repair the roads of their town, but the plan, once adopted,\r\nmust be followed for not less than three years. It has been found that\r\nby the method described the roads have been kept in better condition\r\nthan ever before, and that the cost of the work has actually been less\r\nthan that of road-making by the old way.\r\n\r\nCorrespondent Ohio Farmer: In 1882 I raised a piece of Hubbard squashes.\r\nThe ground was manured very heavily with rich rotten compost, probably\r\nat the rate of fifty tons or more per acre. It is necessary to make the\r\nland very rich to succeed with this crop, but that isn’t the point I am\r\nafter. That same land last year was planted with potatoes, and it was\r\nthere that they rolled out so large and numerous as to yield at the rate\r\nof 500 bushels per acre. Just over the fence, on a part of another lot,\r\nwhere no manure had been applied for many years, there were only 200\r\nbushels per acre. Difference in soil and kinds of potatoes might account\r\nfor some of this great variation in yield, but I think it fair to say\r\nthat 200 bushels per acre of the best yield was owing to the manure put\r\non the ground for squashes the previous year. The potatoes were none of\r\nthem sold for less than forty cents a bushel, so we have at least $80\r\nper acre cash benefit from that heavy manuring the second year, to say\r\nnothing of $240 an acre which the squashes brought. It was, of course, a\r\nlittle more trouble to pick up and market the larger crop, but enough of\r\nthe potatoes were sold for over forty cents per bushel to pay for that.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBROWN’S BRONCHIAL TROCHES for Coughs and Colds: “There is nothing to be\r\ncompared with them.”—_Rev.

The figures show a large falling\r\noff in the arrivals of both live stock and fresh meat when compared with\r\nthe imports of later weeks of the preceding year, more particularly with\r\nregard to live stock, which arrived in very small numbers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nChicago Evening Journal: “The prospect is that the little ring of\r\npolitical office-seekers who want Congress to make places for themselves\r\nas “inspectors” of cattle and hogs will succeed in defeating the\r\nproposed measure of retaliation against those European countries which,\r\nwithout good reason, are discriminating against imported American\r\npork-products. The producers of and dealers in Western cattle and hogs\r\nshould take instant measures to head off Sanders and his gang.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe flock belonging to the estate of the late K. W. Gentry, of Sedalia,\r\nMo., was disposed of at auction last week. The unregistered Merinos were\r\ndisposed of in lots of fifty at from $3.25 to $4.50 per head. Grade\r\nlambs brought $2 to $3. The registered Merinos were sold by sixes and\r\nsevens at from $17.50 to $60 each. The best rams brought from $20 to\r\n$101, and a few of the ram lambs sold at from $18 to $46. Samuel Jewett\r\nbought largely. On the same occasion the Berkshire hogs sold at from $20\r\nto $43; one pair of mules brought $205; the yearling Jersey bull Elmwood\r\nFavorite, bred by Col. C. F. Mills, Springfield, Ill., sold for $165.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Inter-State Short-horn Breeders’ Association held a meeting at\r\nKansas City last week to adopt rules to govern the sales of breeding\r\nShort-horns at the next Fat Stock Show in that city. After considerable\r\ndiscussion it was resolved that the pedigrees be submitted and cattle\r\nready for examination on or before the first day of June, and that the\r\ncommittee be requested to visit and inspect, some time in June, the\r\ncattle offered for the sale. The executive committee was given plenary\r\npowers in regard to deciding what animals are to be admitted in the\r\nsale, and authorized to have the catalogues compiled and published. So\r\nfar over one hundred head have been entered for sale.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe stockmen of Rush county, Kan., have organized an association to be\r\nknown as the Rush County Stockmen’s Union, and adopted a constitution.\r\nThe objects of the association are set forth in the following\r\n_therefore_ of the preamble to the constitution: “In order to protect\r\nourselves from persecution and to secure for ourselves all possible\r\nlegitimate advantages, and in all proper ways to promote the interests\r\nof those in our country engaged in the production of any kind of live\r\nstock, we, a number of the stock growers of Rush county, have formed an\r\norganization known as the Rush County Stockmen’s Union.” It is said\r\nthere exists in Rush county an element of society which is violently\r\nantagonistic to the stock interests.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhile at Elgin last week we accompanied Dr. Pratt to his home to take a\r\nlook at his herd of Holstein cattle. The sight of the long rows of\r\nstalls filled with this young breeding milk stock was a surprise.\r\nCounting a new arrival of twenty-five during our visit the Doctor now\r\nhas about 130 head—certainly one of the largest as it is one of the\r\nbest herds of Holsteins in the country. The Doctor breeds and buys to\r\nsell again, and his trade is large, as he does not demand fancy prices\r\nbut simply a fair return for his investment, care and labor. The famous\r\nbull Cyclone heads the home herd. The females are generally from a year\r\nand a half to three years old. Duchess of York is his brag cow, though\r\nhe has other strains nearly as famous for milk. The young bull,\r\nBerkhout, a prize winner in Holland, is a capital animal. Though a dull\r\nseason of the year shipments from this herd are numerous. A bull and\r\nthree heifers go the present week to J. J. Conklin, Valley Creek, Texas.\r\nH. H. Bissell, Navasota, Texas, takes a bull and two females. The\r\npromising bull Duke, of Oak Hill, goes to A. H. Woodruff, Lansing, Iowa.\r\nMr. W. also takes a yearling heifer. The Duke weighs 1,650 pounds, and\r\nwas but two years old the 17th of June last. The Doctor reports the\r\ndemand from the South as wonderfully increasing. In 1883 he had orders\r\nfrom Texas, Mississippi, Louisiana, Florida, Kentucky and Tennessee. He\r\nwill stock his ranch in Kansas this spring and summer with a view to\r\nsupplying the West and Southwest with grades and full bloods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SCARE IN MISSOURI.\r\n\r\n\r\nInformation was received at the Department of Agriculture, at\r\nWashington, last week that a new and heretofore unknown cattle disease\r\nhas broken out in various parts of Missouri. It was reported most\r\nprevalent in the vicinity of Mexico.\r\n\r\nAs is usual in such matters when first brought to public notice the\r\nfacts have been greatly exaggerated. Dr. Salmon, Chief of the Government\r\nVeterinary Bureau, who was in Chicago this week, says that as presented\r\nto him at Washington he did not consider the outbreak a very serious\r\none. The trouble so far as he knows exists in but a single herd, and\r\nthat near Mexico. He promptly sent a veterinarian to the spot to\r\ninvestigate and report. He judges from the information he has received\r\nthat the disease is simply the impaction of food in the stomach,\r\nsomething far from uncommon at this season of the year. It results\r\ngenerally from eating the dried fodder of the corn-fields. It is in no\r\nsense contagious.\r\n\r\nPerhaps our veterinary editor will give us something regarding the\r\ntreatment of this trouble. In the meantime we give a remedy suggested by\r\na Missouri gentleman who called at this office last week: Keep in a\r\ntrough before the cattle at all times, a mixture of slaked lime and\r\nsalt, and let them have free access to good water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC SALES OF STOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as they have come to our notice the following are the principal\r\nstock sales announced thus far to take place in 1884:\r\n\r\nMarch 19—Wm.

F. H. Brett, Carsington Rectory, writes as follows to the English\r\nagricultural papers:\r\n\r\nSome few years ago, when the foot-and-mouth disease was prevailing, I\r\ngave a farmer in this parish, who had the disease among his cattle, some\r\nsulphur_ous_ acid, and advised him to make trial of the following\r\ntreatment: To put about two ounces of the acid into a quart bottle and\r\nfill up with water, and then give about a tablespoonful of this dilution\r\nthree times a day to the diseased cattle. He acted upon my advice, and\r\nthe result was that his cattle were quickly cured of the disease. Again,\r\ntwo or three weeks ago one of my parishioners came to me to inform me\r\nthat one of his cows was affected with this disease, and to ask me if I\r\ncould give him anything for it. I gave him some of the same acid, to be\r\nused as above stated, and advised him also to burn a little sulphur in\r\nthe shed in which the diseased cow was kept, two or three times a day.\r\nHe followed my advice, and three or four days after I was informed that\r\nthe cow was doing nicely, and was giving her milk again. My confidence\r\nin the remedy is therefore confirmed, and I think I am in duty bound to\r\nmake it as widely known as possible. In addition to giving the acid\r\ninternally, I advised the moistening of the affected feet also with the\r\nsame dilution with a sponge.\r\n\r\nThe sulphur_ous_ acid acts remedially, I conclude, by being destructive\r\nof the life of the microbes, or exceedingly minute animaculæ, that gives\r\nrise to the disease; and I feel persuaded that, if the owners of cattle\r\nwould take the trouble to burn a little sulphur once or twice a week in\r\ntheir cattle sheds, they would not only protect their cattle from\r\nattacks of foot-and-mouth disease, but have them also in a more healthy\r\nand vigorous condition, especially in the season of tying-up and\r\nconfinement.\r\n\r\nI have underlined the last syllable of sulphurous to guard against\r\nmistake. Sulphur_ic_ acid would only be productive of mischief.\r\nSulphur_ous_ acid may be obtained through any druggist in sealed\r\nstoppered bottles at a small expense.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way of burning sulphur in the cowsheds is as follows: Take\r\na slip of cardboard, or of extra stout brown paper, about a foot long\r\nand two inches wide, and place on one extremity about as much\r\ncoarsely-powdered brimstone as would lie on a penny piece, hold it by\r\nthe other end, and apply the flame of a candle till the sulphur is\r\nignited, and then wave it about in the shed, in order to disperse the\r\nvapor among the cattle; if there be straw, or anything else inflammable\r\nabout, hold a tile, or something of the sort, in the other hand, under\r\nthe burning sulphur, to catch any that may drop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE DAIRY\r\n\r\nDairymen, Write for Your Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WISCONSIN DAIRYMEN.\r\n\r\nThe papers and discussions at Lake Mills comprehended quite a range of\r\ntopics, and they were handled with marked ability. Three of the essays\r\nhave now appeared in THE PRAIRIE FARMER in full. They were too good to\r\nslaughter by abridgment, and the same remark applies to other papers,\r\nyet our space is too limited for an unabridged report.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROAD TO THE FACTORY,\r\n\r\nby Robt. Fargo, showed the people how much they are losing by persisting\r\nin having poor roads, when by a small expense they might have good ones.\r\nThe road tax is improperly applied. He thought that a good gravel road\r\nin most localities could be made for $1,000 per mile, the road-bed to be\r\ngraveled one foot deep and twelve feet wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA VS. WISCONSIN.\r\n\r\nMr. Harris’ paper, printed in last week’s FARMER, elicited considerable\r\ndiscussion. Members desired to know if, in the essayist’s opinion,\r\nCanadian dairy management was superior to that of the States, and\r\nespecially of Wisconsin. The reply was in the affirmative. There seems\r\nto be more thoroughness on the part of Canadian dairymen. They have no\r\nbetter grass, nor water, nor cows. They discriminate more rigidly\r\nbetween good and bad patrons. They sometimes bring the law to bear\r\nagainst those who water milk or skim it. The factories there are mostly\r\nowned by stock companies. When tainted milk is discovered in the vat, it\r\nis traced back as soon as possible to its source, and the patron\r\nbringing it is excluded. The law there is similar to that in New York\r\nand was founded upon that law. Mr. Fish related an instance where a\r\nfraudulent patron in Herkimer county, N. Y., had been detected, sued,\r\nand heavily fined for his practices. Mr. Harris said as inspector of\r\nfactories, he always refused to receive milk from cows allowed to feed\r\non slough grass or drink stagnant water. Such milk would always prevent\r\nthe manufacture of good cheese. He wants no milk from cows forced to\r\nfeed on marshes. When a man applies to a factory to sell his milk, he\r\nlooks the man over, he visits his farm, he looks at the stables and all\r\nthe surroundings, and he can generally tell whether or not it is safe to\r\nreceive that man’s milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPETITION.\r\n\r\nIt cropped out in this discussion that in some parts of Wisconsin and\r\nIllinois there are too many factories. Competition leads factorymen to\r\noften receive milk that should be discarded. To offend a man by\r\nenforcing strict cleanliness, non-skimming, and stripping was to drive\r\nhim to a neighboring factory and his custom is lost. It is hard to make\r\nowners of cows honest when dishonest or selfish factorymen encourage\r\nthem in selfish and fraudulent ways. Mr. Harris said at some of the best\r\nCanadian factories patrons were refused the privilege of taking home the\r\nwhey in their milk cans. He would have no objection to their taking the\r\nwhey if all would cleanse their cans properly. But this could not be\r\ndepended upon.\r\n\r\n\r\nWATER IN MILK.\r\n\r\nHe detects water in milk by means of a little German instrument called\r\nHorren’s Milk Tester, patented in Hanover. They cost fifty cents each by\r\nthe 100. They are for sale by Cornish & Curtis, Ft. Atkinson, Wis., and\r\nby some others of the dairy supply concerns. This little instrument is\r\ninvaluable to the factoryman.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRIDE IN BUSINESS.\r\n\r\nAnother thing about the Canadians is they take such pride in their\r\nbusiness that they are not given to adulterating their butter and\r\ncheese. They make a cheese that sells as the best cheddar in the English\r\nmarkets. The best Wisconsin cheese that Mr. Harris saw at the Milwaukee\r\ndairy fair was several points below the best Canadian article. The\r\ndifference lies in the want of skill in the maker, and the greed of the\r\npatrons which often leads them to skim and to withhold the strippings.\r\n\r\n\r\nSKIMMING.\r\n\r\nThere were those present who claimed that more money can be realized by\r\nmaking both butter and cheese than from cheese alone, though its quality\r\nmakes it bring a higher price. So long as this is the case such will\r\ncontinue to make skim cheese. They say a man must be governed by the\r\nmarket he is to supply. If one makes for a home market where skim cheese\r\nis liked it is all right to make butter from the same milk. It was\r\nreplied that as our dairymen in general must look abroad for their\r\nmarket, that good, straight, full cream cheese is bound to win in the\r\nlong run. When the foreign market for the Wisconsin product is\r\ndestroyed it will take years of honest effort to rebuild the old\r\nreputation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHEDDAR.\r\n\r\nThe cheddar cheese of Canada is made by drawing off the whey while it is\r\nsweet, the curd being allowed to sour afterward. It takes too long to\r\nmake this cheese to suit the Western cheese-maker. But you can not make\r\nthe best cheese in a hurry. There is more nutriment in the cheddar than\r\nin the common cheese of the States.\r\n\r\n\r\nBY THE ACRE.\r\n\r\nMr. Hiram Smith said in his paper that he computes his butter and cheese\r\nby the acre, meaning that his effort is to see how much dairy product he\r\ncan get from an acre of ground. The herd of cows that can produce the\r\nmost from a mow of hay or a given amount of pasturage is the best herd.\r\nThat system which will take 1,000 lbs. of feed and get the most from it\r\nis the best system. He plows up about four acres of pasture every year,\r\nand proposes to reduce the acreage of his pasture thus gradually to the\r\nend. He grows feed for the cows on the acres plowed up. It is the\r\ncheapest method. He uses green feed, bran, straw, roots, etc. This gives\r\nthe most milk at the least expense. He uses the submerging system of\r\nbutter-making. A bushel basket full of pounded ice twice per day will\r\nkeep milk cool regardless of weather. Cool the milk suddenly no matter\r\nwhat the system. Four pounds of butter from 100 pounds of milk is all he\r\nexpects to get in summer. In fall, perhaps another pound, but it will\r\nnot be of so high a grade.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOLSTEINS.\r\n\r\nMr. Curtis, of New York, said a good word for the Holsteins as dairy\r\nstock. At the Cornell University farm they come in at two years, are\r\nmilked seven or eight years, and then fattened for beef. He would not\r\nrecommend this system for all breeds.\r\n\r\n\r\nCALVES.\r\n\r\nMr. Northup said he can raise better calves on skimmed milk than on\r\nwhole milk. Others agreed with him, and a few differed, asking what the\r\nLord put the cream in milk for. Reply: to mix with butterine.\r\n\r\n\r\nITEMS.\r\n\r\nProfessor Henry mentioned some of the experiments now being carried on\r\nat the State University to show the value of different stock foods,\r\ntile, drainage, etc. He is feeding cotton seed meal, malt, sprouts, oil\r\ncake, ensilage, etc. Cotton seed meal induces a very rich flow of milk.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith thinks skimmed milk worth 35 cents per 100 pounds for\r\ncheese-making, for those who have a demand for that kind of cheese.\r\n\r\nMr. Favill, of Walworth county, set the teeth of the dairymen on edge,\r\nby asserting and proving by figures that he could make more money from\r\nsame outlay in beef making in six months, than any of them could in a\r\nyear from the dairy. Mr. F. will write out his experience in this line\r\nfor THE PRAIRIE FARMER at an early day.\r\n\r\nWe cut short our notes of the discussions somewhat, to make room for Mr.\r\nSmith’s instructive essay on\r\n\r\n\r\nNEGLECTED OPPORTUNITIES.\r\n\r\nSo long as it is true that the average yield, per cow, in milk that is\r\ntaken to the factories is less rather than more than 3,000 pounds per\r\nseason, and so long as it is true that there are dairymen whose cows\r\nyield from 4,000 to 5,000 pounds each per season, it will be easy to\r\nmake it appear there are neglected opportunities on the part of most\r\ndairymen which, if availed of, would greatly augment the annual yield,\r\nand consequently make larger the profits.\r\n\r\nOne of the fundamental truths in stock-raising, and in profitable milk\r\nproduction, is, that it takes a given amount of food to support the\r\nanimal’s existence in such a way that it will simply maintain its\r\nstatus; and that growth in flesh or yield in milk, above an evenly\r\nbalanced existence, must come from the food given to cause an increase\r\nof weight in flesh, fat, or milk products. Hence, all the profit must\r\ncome from that excess, and is large or small just in proportion as the\r\nanimal is capacitated to utilize and digest it, within the bounds of\r\nhealthy, judicious feeding. So that farmer was sound who, when he fed up\r\nto the very verge of that limit, and was told by a skeptic that he did\r\nnot believe high feeding paid, replied he was only sorry that his cows\r\ncould not healthfully digest more. The capital invested in the cows, in\r\nthe soil, in the barns and stables, in the care and time devoted to\r\nmilking and waiting on them, is very nearly the same, whether they\r\nproduce 3,000 pounds each per season, or 5,000 pounds. At first it may\r\nbe granted that if a farm is stocked to its capacity in feeding a herd\r\nof 3,000-pound cows, that some outside food must be imported from other\r\nsoil to enable the same herd to yield 5,000 pounds each. But the\r\nenriching of the manure through high feeding, and the consequent\r\nenriching of the land, will soon obviate the necessity of the\r\nimportation of outside food. If this is not true, I admit that my\r\nopinion is based on false premises; and that the opponents of high\r\nfeeding have the best of the argument, as well as a majority of the\r\ndisciples, and a majority of the thinly-covered bones of the so-called\r\ndairy stock of the State. In support of the idea that there is an added\r\nvalue to the manure through high feeding, it may be stated that there\r\nare many places in the Eastern States in which in estimating the\r\nearnings of the cow each year, that the milk, or butter and cheese, the\r\ncalf and the pork are not only counted, but $10 per well-fed cow is\r\nadded for the increased value she has put upon the soil, deposited it in\r\na bank that never breaks. What is true of the old East is fast becoming\r\ntrue of the soil of the older settled portions of Wisconsin. To augment\r\nthe productive capacity of a given number of acres, that will now\r\nsupport in semi-starvation a given number of cows, to a point in\r\nfertility that will add 2,000 pounds of milk per annum to each cow, milk\r\nworth, say $20, is to have the funds in hand to pay the sum of $400 as\r\ninterest on the added value to an ordinary farm of eighty acres that is\r\nmade to well keep twenty cows, instead of keeping them in the usual way.\r\nFour hundred dollars will pay 5 per cent interest per annum on an added\r\nvalue of $100 per acre to the farm. This can be done without adding a\r\ncow to the herd. All done by a simple expansion, through better use of\r\nthe capital already in the hands of many who work on the semi-starvation\r\nplan.\r\n\r\nThe very first neglected opportunity of the mass of farmers is, that\r\nthey do not see, and do not make much effort to see, that there is a\r\nbetter way than to plow, and plow, and plow, seldom seed down, keep a\r\nfew head of spindling cows, mostly to give birth to spindling calves,\r\nthat by a stretch of the imagination may be called cows when five or six\r\nyears old; sell such cows, instead of selling butter and cheese to buy\r\ntheir clothes and groceries, sell hay to buy their whisky, and their\r\nfarms by the bushel to pay for them if in debt, or to add some\r\nimprovements in buildings if they are not. It would be useless to\r\nfurther describe them—they are not here, as they never go to dairy\r\nconventions, or even to county agricultural meetings or annual fairs;\r\nand so any rebuke of their methods would not reach their ears. Let them\r\npass; the chief regret for their fate being that their name is legion,\r\nand that they seem to be beyond the reach of mercy.\r\n\r\nThe next class, and the one for which this association has much\r\nmissionary work to do, is the one that has shown some signs of progress;\r\nthat is still in unbelief of the radical truth, but yet seems to be\r\nuttering the invocation of doubting Thomas, of old. The most marked\r\nneglect of opportunity by this class is in not accepting the truth\r\nalluded to previously, that it pays to transform 2,500 and 3,000-pound\r\ncows into 4,000 and 5,000-pound ones, through the process of more\r\ngenerous, and better paying feeding. Many of this class know that a\r\npaying flow of milk comes only from food judiciously given; but who have\r\nnot yet learned the programme by which such food can be ever on hand, or\r\ndo not possess the intelligent enterprise to put forth the means to\r\nobtain it. As this is, largely, the hopeful class, we may well pray for\r\ntheir growth in dairy grace, in the knowledge of the truth, as it is\r\nexemplified in the reliable experience of the few saints in the\r\nbusiness, who know how to make good common cows earn $50 and $60, and\r\nmore, each, per annum.\r\n\r\nObservation and my factory books for a series of years, teach that\r\npersons of this class start out well in the spring, and have cows that\r\nmaintain the flowing stream for awhile, so that the\r\nfour-and-five-thousand pound yield would be obtained if they did not\r\nsuffer it to come to grief, by not providing means to hedge against the\r\nimmediate and consequent influences of the first serious check in the\r\nsupply of palatable and easily digested food in the pastures. This is\r\nthe great fatality of the whole business—a tolerated calamity as we may\r\ncall it, for it endures a lapse that can not afterward be made good, the\r\nsame season. It is to the paying yield of the cow what an untimely frost\r\nis to an unmatured corn crop. It is my firm belief that this is the\r\ngreat sin of the medium good dairyman of this and other dairy\r\nStates,—the cause of the low average earnings of the cows; the reason\r\nwhy so many dairymen work so cheaply; the promoter of infidelity in the\r\nmind of the dairyman as to whether he has not made a mistake in entering\r\nupon the dairy business at all; in short, it is the chief “neglected\r\nopportunity” to get upon the highway to success. That opportunity, when\r\ninterpreted, means that when the chief available supply of food fails,\r\nor lessens, or becomes unpalatable or undigestible, that a substitute\r\npreviously provided should be immediately supplied. Let the substitute\r\nbe early rye, clover, oats, millet, corn, or other fodder, grown for the\r\npurpose, according to the time in the season in which the pressing need\r\ncomes; and if neither are in available time, then let the substitute\r\ntake the form of ground grain in larger measures than should be given to\r\nevery cow in milk, every day, even when feeding on the flushest and\r\nchoicest of grasses. That is the way the 5,000-pound to the cow dairymen\r\ndo; and they win in doing it. But the blighted class seem to look upon\r\nit as they would on an accidental fire, an untimely death, an early\r\nfrost, an unavertable calamity; a kind of Providential dispensation, the\r\nsuperstitious regard it. The latter class betake themselves to prayer\r\nfor rain, instead of taking the scoop-shovel to the provender, and\r\ndistributing it to their famishing herds. Troops of them don’t know that\r\nthey are suffering any but present loss in weight, and delude themselves\r\ninto thinking a blessed rain will restore their cows to the position\r\nthey fell from. They don’t seem to comprehend that they thus lose their\r\ngrip on the $50 and $60 per annum prize, and their uncertainty of\r\ngetting it. The result is, they have their big flow of milk at the\r\nseason of the year in which dairy products are ever the cheapest; and\r\ntheir cows are crippled for good performance at the pail, when\r\never-returning good prices in the fall and early winter show them what\r\ngolden opportunities they have lost.\r\n\r\nNow I can look over my list of patrons and see in my mind’s eye the men\r\nwho practice both the systems I allude to. One is the discomforted,\r\ndoubting dairyman with but too little to show for his hard work; and the\r\nother has a good bank account, or a plethoric purse, and his sharpest\r\nlook is given in search of more good cows, whose owners don’t know any\r\nmore than to sell them. There is not a whine about them, nor do they go\r\ninto a decline because another half-cent could not be squeezed out of\r\nthe cheese market. Their talk is, content with “well done,” and their\r\ncure for hard times is, “more milk.”\r\n\r\nThe most manifest loss, as it appears to one taking note of merely\r\ndollars and cents, in the prosecution of any special pursuit comes to\r\nlight in the dairy business, from this the chief neglected opportunity\r\nof the dairymen to gain more wealth.\r\n\r\nThere are other neglected opportunities,—minor matters in\r\nthemselves—that if improved would make the goal of the enterprising\r\ndairymen easier of attainment, and are, therefore, desirable adjuncts in\r\naccomplishing his purposes, and they seem to be concomitants of\r\nmeasurably high success. One is in not properly testing the real\r\nprofit-earning capacity of each cow, and weeding out those that are not\r\nonly not profitable but are actually, year after year, eating into the\r\nprofits derived from other, and it may be not so good appearing cows.\r\nProfitable performance not only at the pail, but at the churn and the\r\ncheese-vat, should alone give a cow respite from coming, in her youth,\r\nto the butcher’s block.\r\n\r\nAnother, is that there is a woeful benightedness in providing stables\r\nsuitable to milk in, and easy and healthful for the cows to live in, as\r\nthey should be allowed to do for more than half of the hours of the\r\nyear. The advanced dairymen who have plank floors daily littered,\r\ncleaned, and cleansed, drops in the floor, and clean walks in the rear\r\nof the cows, well-ventilated, but warm, non-freezing stables, would be\r\namazed and disgusted to enter what I greatly fear are a majority of the\r\nstables of the State, in which the cows are thrust to endure a painful\r\nand filthy existence. When purity of product has a great influence in\r\ngauging the price, and the health of consumers is at stake, this neglect\r\nin providing better and more cleanly stabling is one of the crying ills\r\nof our dairy system. I am glad to know that the supervision of the\r\nhealth officials of Milwaukee extends to the stables of the cows that\r\nproduce the milk that is allowed to be sold in that city. It would be\r\nwell if it was made the imperative duty of the health officials of every\r\ntown to forcibly establish the blessings of a decent civilization in the\r\ncow stables of more than half of the farmers of Wisconsin. I am moved to\r\nthus speak because of what I have seen—and smelled. I will not quarrel\r\nwith a man who claims the unalienable right to rot, as a hermit, but I\r\ndeny his right to freely make and sell to others, unwholesome food, into\r\nwhich he has mingled filth and the germs of disease and death. It is\r\nshameful to neglect to provide good and healthful stables for\r\nfood-producing dairy stock—one that calls for vengeance on a\r\ncriminality.\r\n\r\nAnother neglected opportunity of the dairymen to increase the number of\r\nhead their farms might subsist, and thus increase their profits,\r\nespecially those who occupy our highest priced lands, is in their\r\ndeclining to adopt the system of soiling. I do not know of a highly\r\nsuccessful dairyman in the State who has not adopted it, in part, at\r\nleast—enough to save his cows when famine is in sight. Neither do I\r\nbelieve there is one who would not be more successful if he should\r\npractice it more. The arrived-at goal of the select few who keep as many\r\ncows as they have acres of land, has been reached by and through the\r\nsoiling process; and approximate successes like theirs must be achieved\r\nby traveling the same route. There are those who are ensmalling their\r\npastures, and at the same time, increasing their herds, because the\r\nlands taken from the pasture and devoted to soiling crops produce more\r\nthan the old herds can consume. The wandering cow feeds herself, in\r\nfact, from what might be the choicest product of her own milk, tramps\r\nthe life out of much more, and tosses her head in disdain at much that\r\nif cut and properly fed in the stall, she would eat with a relish; so\r\nthat it may be safely said that two, and some practical men say three,\r\ncows might be well-fed through soiling, on the same land that one is by\r\nthe system of exclusive pasturing.\r\n\r\nAnother, it may well be called the lost opportunity—that grows out of\r\nthe neglected ones alluded to, is that the cows are not kept in good\r\nmilking condition more of the time of the year. The men who seize and\r\nutilize the few opportunities I have mentioned very soon learn that they\r\nhave an almost perpetual fount of wealth; and that they can not afford\r\nto dry it up, and wait for spring. Putting in more time for the cow to\r\nproduce, inevitably convinces them of the fact that the larger part of\r\nthe cow’s earnings are made when dairy products are high in price; and\r\nthey are dull, indeed, if they do not see in that a revelation that more\r\nwinter dairying would pay. I am aware that the flippant answer made by\r\nthose disinclined to adopt soiling and winter dairying, is, that they\r\ninvolve employment of more manual labor on a given number of acres, and\r\nthat reliable farm labor is hard to get and troublesome to keep. This is\r\nthe first superficial pretext of nine-tenths of those advanced enough to\r\never give these subjects a serious thought. Nevertheless, the practice\r\nof these innovations are essential in the higher grade of farming; and\r\nthat practice, instead of being an ill, is a blessing to the farm, to\r\nthe farmer, to his older children, and to the hired laborer; for it\r\ngives all of them steady and profitable employment, while the present\r\nsystem requires the far greater proportion of labor in the spring and\r\nsummer months, and furnishes less to do in winter for the hired man and\r\nthe grown-up boys and girls. They thus lounge, often, in debasing\r\nidleness, or are early weaned from the farm, and go away, never to\r\nreturn to partake of its real, invigorating life, its independence, and\r\nits joys. The dairy, with the accompaniment of soiling and more\r\nproduction of dairy products in the winter, would make the farm more\r\nlike a factory, with every wheel in motion almost the entire year. The\r\nhome and the family of the dairy farmer should be as large as the\r\ncapacity of the man and the woman at the helm; and as steady employment\r\nas that which must be given to the store or shop would go a long way in\r\ndeveloping and increasing the capacity of the whole force to manage\r\nmore. Giving regular employment to good men on the farm makes it far\r\neasier to get and to keep them; and it retains a more brawny set of men,\r\nwho are otherwise enticed to the factories and railways that give steady\r\nwork, and so have the pick of the intelligent and most reliable ones. It\r\nis an accomplishment in a farmer and his wife to know how to get, and\r\nhow to keep good, faithful hired men. I know of those who are slaves,\r\nbecause they don’t know how. Many of them ascribe it to the men, when\r\nthey themselves are principally at fault. There is a mortal dread of\r\n“tramps,” especially among the more ignorant farmers. But I aver that\r\nthe common system of almost exclusive grain farming that crowds most of\r\nthe labor of the year into a few spring and summer months, is a direct\r\ncause of much of the tramp evil of which so many farmers complain. It\r\nmanufactures the tramps who rove from necessity, and even drives out\r\ntheir own children to swell the ranks of those in search of a job. On\r\nthe other hand, a large increase of milk-stock kept on the farm\r\nnecessitates the retention of most of the manual force of the summer\r\nmonths. Not how to dispense with hired labor or the labor of his\r\nchildren, but how to profitably employ and elevate it, and make it\r\ninviting, rather than abhorrent and slavish, is the problem the\r\nprogressive farmer should study to solve. The manufacturer counts upon\r\nadditional gains through the addition of well-employed laborers. The\r\nfarmer could do the same if he used more educated brains and a little\r\nless over-taxed muscle in his business. The bulk of every fortune\r\nsteadily acquired, consists of the success of its possessor in getting,\r\nhonestly or dishonestly, a profit from the labors of others. This must\r\nbe so, so long as it is an axiom in political economy that labor is the\r\nbasis of all wealth. The owner of the soil can succeed in winning more\r\nthan a pro rata proportion, just in the ratio of his ability to make his\r\nbrains help the work of his hands.\r\n\r\nI know of whole sections, and even contiguous miles square, on which the\r\nsystem of farming prevails that I have condemned—the hired man is\r\nunknown, save only for short periods of the year—the children gone to\r\nthe cities, to the factories, the railroads, or to the West—the land\r\ndenuded of stock, almost, as well as of the rightful ones to care for\r\nit; and half-impoverished farms, half farmed by the old folks, or\r\ncontinuously cropped on shares by more indigent neighbors. Possessions\r\nthat by nature are as fair as ever the sun shone upon, that do not, and\r\ncan not now pay five per cent interest on $25 per acre; when well\r\nmanaged dairy farms in the same county pay more than that per cent on a\r\nbasis of $100 per acre. In view of these patent facts that stare us in\r\nthe face, is it any wonder that some of us feel we have a loud call to\r\ndispense the pure dairy gospel to these perishing sinners who thus\r\nneglect their grand opportunities.\r\n\r\nIn some one of the first sentences of this paper I alluded to the\r\ninfluence of good and profitable farming in improving the condition and\r\nstanding of the farmer, as a man among men. This, after all, is the\r\ncrowning objective point, or should be, of all those who make the most\r\nof the opportunities the great mass neglect. If with all his getting a\r\nman does not get some real wisdom, some development in stalwart\r\nmorality, and a higher cultivation of the mind, it needs no Solomon or\r\nBible to tell the on-lookers that he is a comparative failure; and it\r\nought to be apparent to himself. The legitimate profits of a higher\r\ngrade of farming ought to be expended to elevate the farmer, his wife,\r\nhis children, and all the attendants whom he directs. Part of them\r\nshould appear in the form of better and more comfortable houses and\r\nbarns, finer stock, better horses, better roads and school-houses, a\r\nlarger list of newspapers and periodicals, better libraries and better\r\nhousekeeping, and more cheery houses in which intelligence and music are\r\nnot strangers. It is as important that a man should spend his earnings\r\naright, as that he should use his energies and talents to earn. It is\r\nnot a manly element in a man whose chief forte is that he can hold all\r\nhe can get. A clam can do that, and not suffer much, either, in a\r\ncomparison of brains with the groveling getter of mere wealth. The high\r\nbehest to earn much, by and through grand opportunities to labor and\r\ndirect labor, blossoms into blessing in its best sense only when the\r\nearnings are spent to increase the intelligence, add to the comforts,\r\nand aid men to discharge their private and public duties more nobly than\r\nit is possible for a man to do with an income that simply gives him\r\nbread.\r\n\r\nBecause the earnings of the farm are not more frequently spent in thus\r\ninstalling a section of paradise on the farm, is the real cause of the\r\nstampede therefrom of many of the smart ones who deem the struggle for\r\nelevation there a hopeless one, and, catching an inspiration from the\r\nshriek of civilization that announces each swiftly flying train, they\r\nturn their backs on what have been to them farm dungeons, and mingle\r\nwith the surging throng in quest of a better condition. That they are\r\noften mistaken and baffled in taking such a route, does not deter a new\r\ncrowd from going. They fly from what they dread, as much as they are\r\ninspired by what they hope to win. These things ought not so to be; and\r\na wise improvement of the many neglected opportunities on the farm would\r\ngo far to rectify the ills they fly from, but from which yet few escape.\r\n\r\nSay what we will about all its defects, its uninviting toil, and low\r\nwages, agriculture disenthralled of its ignorance is the basis rock of\r\nour hope; and he is a slanderer of the noblest occupation who raises the\r\nveil to expose its defects and servility for any other purpose than to\r\nhelp make greener its verdure, and brighten its bloom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREMEMBER _that $2.00 pays for_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER _from this\r\ndate to January 1, 1885; For $2.00 you get it for one year and a\r\ncopy of_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER COUNTY MAP OF THE UNITED STATES,\r\nFREE! _This is the most liberal offer ever made by any first-class\r\nweekly agricultural paper in this country._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHORTICULTURAL\r\n\r\nHorticulturists, Write for Your Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FARMER’S GARDEN.\r\n\r\nBY J. M. SMITH.\r\n\r\nA few years ago it was necessary for me to call upon a gentleman upon\r\nsome business. After my business was completed and I was about to leave,\r\nI started toward the garden. He called to me saying, “Do not go\r\nthere—you can not get through the garden.” I arrived at the border and\r\nstopped. He had evidently complied with one of the necessities of a good\r\ngarden, viz., plenty of manure, for it is simply impossible for weeds to\r\ngrow at the rate, or attain the size they had there, except upon very\r\nrich land.\r\n\r\nRabbits would have been perfectly secure from foxes, and foxes from\r\ndogs, in that immense and tangled growth of weeds.\r\n\r\nThe owner of that garden was one the best and most enterprising farmers\r\nin the State. He had at one time been president of his State\r\nagricultural society.\r\n\r\nMany years ago I visited a friend living upon a 160 acre farm. It was\r\none of the most beautiful section farms that I have ever seen either in\r\nthis or any other State. While there I was speaking of a splendid crop\r\nof melons that were then just ripening. He said, in rather a fretful\r\nmanner, “I do not see why my melons do not grow. I know the land is\r\nrich, and there are no weeds in the hills. I hoed them all up only a few\r\ndays ago.” I walked out to his garden with him, and there were his poor,\r\npuny vines struggling for life. As he said, there were no weeds in the\r\nhills, a little circle of perhaps two or three feet in diameter had been\r\nhoed out, and the balance of the land was covered with a dense growth of\r\nweeds from two to six feet in height.\r\n\r\nHe had a most industrious and refined lady for a wife, and young\r\nchildren growing up around him, and, as before stated, a most excellent\r\nas well as valuable farm. Yet not one early pea or one ear of sweet\r\ncorn; not even early potatoes or a tomato, or, in fact, anything that by\r\nany stretch of the imagination could be called a garden bed—yet the man\r\nhas been to college.\r\n\r\nAnother gentleman said in my presence, “In the spring, at the proper\r\ntime, I purchase cabbage seed and sow them; when it is time to set them\r\nout I buy the plants and plant them; when it is time for cabbages they\r\nare _there_, and so I always have cabbages.”\r\n\r\nHe is among the very best farmers in the State. He teaches others how to\r\nfarm, and does it well. The man who attacks him in a convention needs a\r\nstrong cause and a ready tongue, or he will be apt to consider his own\r\ncause a very poor one before he gets through with it. This man has been\r\npresident of a State dairymen’s association.\r\n\r\nOne case more: Another gentleman, who is far above the average farmer,\r\nand who has also been president of a State dairymen’s association, as\r\nwell as a public teacher, as he was going out to attend a farmers’\r\nmeeting or convention, where he was expected to be a teacher, happened\r\nto look out over the place where his garden should have been, and saw an\r\nimmense growth of weeds going to seed. He said to his sons and hired\r\nmen, “Boys, bring out a team and hitch to the mower, and mow off the\r\ngarden; I can not conscientiously go and teach others how to farm with\r\nthat crop of weeds going to seed in my own garden.” The work was done.\r\n“There,” said he, “I can now go and teach without a troubled conscience.\r\nThere are no weeds going to seed in my garden.”\r\n\r\nI have strong hopes of this gentleman. He has a conscience. He attends\r\nchurch; and although I consider him intellectually as far superior to\r\nmost of the preachers of the day, yet if the right man should become his\r\npastor, I fully believe that there is salvation for him even in this\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nAs to the other three the case seems at least to be a very doubtful one.\r\nOne can not but be reminded of the anecdote of the three little boys who\r\nhad commenced studying the catechism. Some one asked them if they had\r\nlearned any of it? “Oh, yes,” says one of them, “I am past\r\njustification.” A second one says, “I am past sanctification.” The third\r\njumps up and says, “I have beat them all; I am clear past redemption.”\r\nIt is much to be feared that the three first described gentlemen are\r\nall of them clear past redemption.\r\n\r\nLet us turn for a moment to a farmer’s garden of another order. He has a\r\nbeautiful as well as an excellent farm. Around his house are quite a\r\nnumber of handsome trees that stood there when the Indians were the\r\nproprietors of the soil. The present owner has added such other trees as\r\nhe thought would add both to its beauty and comfort. The house is a\r\nnumber of rods from the highway, and in the summer is one of the most\r\nbeautiful rural homes that I ever saw. Back of, and near by, the house\r\nis his garden. It is so arranged that most of its crops can be\r\ncultivated with a horse and cultivator. A nice asparagus bed furnishes\r\nnot only himself and family an abundant supply of this the first as well\r\nas one of the best of the products of the outdoor garden, but also a\r\nquantity to sell. His strawberry beds, containing only a few of the\r\nstandard varieties and a very few plants of some of the most promising\r\nof the new ones, were models of both beauty and economy in their\r\narrangement for cultivating both well and cheaply. The same was true of\r\nhis peas, beans, sweet corn, cabbages, potatoes, etc. His raspberries,\r\nboth red and black-caps, furnished an abundant supply for the family\r\nduring their season. The same is true of his blackberries and grapes.\r\n\r\nA short distance from these well cared-for necessaries and luxuries of\r\nhis farm is a moderate-sized and well cared-for orchard. I have no doubt\r\nhe can, if he wishes, have some of the products of his orchard or\r\ngarden, or both, upon his table every day of the year.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman who owns and controls this farm has never been president\r\nof any State dairymen’s association, nor has he ever been sent to\r\nCongress. But, gentlemen, he is one of the most thoroughly wide awake\r\nand enterprising, as well as one of the very best farmers that Wisconsin\r\ncan boast of; and we have some good ones.\r\n\r\nThe question very naturally arises, Why is it that so many, not only of\r\nour common, but of our very best farmers, fail to have anything that can\r\nbe called even a poor garden? It is not because they do not like its\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nTime and again have men who were good farmers, when looking over my\r\ngrounds, said: “Well, it is too bad that I have not had a decent garden;\r\nbut I am determined to have one after this, and will neglect it no\r\nlonger.” I have no recollection of any farmer’s family among my\r\nacquaintances who would not enjoy its products. Perhaps the best reason,\r\nand often the only one, that can be given for so many almost entire\r\nfailures in this respect is the want of time. It is a well-known fact\r\nthat almost all of our farmers are short of the help they really need to\r\nkeep their farms in good condition. Something is sure to be neglected,\r\nand, in three cases out of four, if not in nine out of ten, the poor\r\ngarden is the first thing that is left to care for itself, which it\r\ngenerally does by growing a tremendous crop of weeds.\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly useless to attempt to have a respectable garden, unless\r\narrangements are made in the spring for its planting and cultivation\r\nwith the same care that arrangements are made for the care of the wheat,\r\noats, corn, or potato crop, or the care of the dairy.\r\n\r\nWhen these arrangements are made and faithfully carried into execution\r\nduring the season, then shall we see good gardens upon our farms; and\r\nnot only that, but, as a rule, they will be the best paying pieces of\r\nland upon the farm, not only in the comfort they give to the family, but\r\nin the profit as well.\r\n\r\nI do not propose at this time to give you a treatise upon gardening. A\r\nfew hints that may be of value to those who wish to make some\r\nimprovement, is all that will be attempted.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, select, if you can have a choice, a piece of light,\r\nloamy soil, with a little sand, if you can get it. A heavy clay soil\r\nwill raise as large a crop as the one above mentioned, but it is not as\r\nearly, and is much more expensive and different to work. In laying out a\r\ngarden on a farm take plenty of room, and arrange the goods in such a\r\nmanner that the greatest possible amount of work can be performed with\r\nthe horse.\r\n\r\nThe selection of seeds is to me the most annoying and perplexing job of\r\nthe season. The circulars come pouring in, and are filled with the names\r\nof new varieties of this and that and the other, each better than any\r\nother of its kind, and so very desirable that you are apt to think that\r\nyou must have a few of the seeds just to try them.\r\n\r\nOf course, there is occasionally some improvement made in vegetables and\r\nplants but it is safe to say that in nineteen cases out of twenty the\r\nfarmer or the amateur who invests in some new varieties of seeds or\r\nplants upon the recommendation of his circular, loses both money and\r\ntime by the operation. If I should record my own experience in this line\r\nduring the past twenty-five years, the result would show that I have\r\ndrawn an occasional prize and a marvelous number of blanks, and some of\r\nthem very annoying, as well as expensive ones.\r\n\r\nI will give you a list of such seeds as have proven themselves to be\r\nabout the best that I can find, after years of experience:\r\n\r\n    Asparagus—Conover’s Colossal.\r\n\r\n    Beets—Early Egyptian for first early; Early Blood Turnip for\r\n    fall and winter.\r\n\r\n    Carrots—Early Scarlet-Horn.\r\n\r\n    Parsnips—Common Dutch Hollow-crown.\r\n\r\n    Ruta Bagas—American purple top, imp.\r\n\r\n    Turnips—Flat Dutch.\r\n\r\n    Bush Beans—German Dwarf Black Wax.\r\n\r\n    Pole do.—Lima.\r\n\r\n    Cucumbers—White Spine.\r\n\r\n    Cabbage—First Early Jersey Wakefield; Fall and Winter, Prem.\r\n    Flat Dutch.\r\n\r\n    Celery—Golden Dwarf.\r\n\r\n    Muskmelons—Early White, Japan, and Hackensack.\r\n\r\n    Watermelons—Mountain Sweet.\r\n\r\n    Cauliflower—Early Dwarf, Eurfart.\r\n\r\n    Peas—Extra early Dan O’Rourke, American Wonder, Champion of\r\n    England.\r\n\r\n    Summer Squash—Round Scallop, American Turban, Hubbard.\r\n\r\n    Lettuce—Curled Simpson and Boston Market.\r\n\r\n    Pepper—Large Bell and Butternosed.\r\n\r\n    Tomato—Trophy and Acme.\r\n\r\n    Sweet Corn—Early Minn., Crosby’s Early, Stowell’s Evergreen.\r\n    These if planted at same time will give proper succession.\r\n\r\n    Radishes—French Breakfast, and Covent Garden.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the small fruits I will recommend as follows:\r\nStrawberries—Wilson’s Albany seedling for main crop. If a few very\r\nlarge ones are wanted try the No. 30, and the Sharpless. With me they\r\nare both worthless except for the purpose of producing a few very large\r\nberries. To lengthen out the season the Kentucky is the best of any that\r\nI know of. Downer’s Prolific is also a fair bearer, of excellent\r\nquality. I am constantly trying those of the new varieties that seem to\r\nme most likely to do well, but almost invariably lose both time and\r\nmoney. I have some twelve or fifteen varieties of these now on trial,\r\nbut presume the result with nearly or quite all, will be the same as\r\nwith hundreds of others I have had during the last twenty-five years,\r\nviz., after two or three years of trouble and expense plow them under\r\nfor manure.\r\n\r\nFor raspberries, the Doolittle and the Mammoth Cluster have done nicely\r\namong the black-caps. The Gregg is also highly recommended by those who\r\nhave tried it. I have not tried it a sufficient time to tell what it\r\nwill do with me. The Philadelphia is a standard among the reds, and\r\njustly so. After two or three years’ trial I think very highly of the\r\nCuthbert, although with me it is not as hardy as the Philadelphia. In\r\nfact, they all do better for being covered in winter.\r\n\r\nBlackberries. For this portion of the State I know of nothing that I\r\nbelieve would give better satisfaction than Stone’s Hardy.\r\n\r\nAmong currants, the Red and White Dutch are still the standards.\r\n\r\nThe Concord grape is yet among grapes about what the Wilson is among\r\nstrawberries—the standard for the million. The Worden, a seedling of\r\nthe Concord, is very promising, and may yet prove to be a strong\r\ncompetitor in the race. The Delaware does splendidly in the Fox River\r\nValley, but is not as reliable in all parts of the State as the\r\nabove-named varieties.\r\n\r\nI have tried to recommend nothing but what will do well with good fair\r\ncultivation upon any good soil. Yet you will often be annoyed in\r\nselecting seed, from the fact that the same seed is sent out by\r\ndifferent seedsmen under different names. For instance, I have had early\r\npeas sent to me under different names and by different seedsmen and all\r\nplanted on the same day, side by side, all cared for precisely alike,\r\nand all alike claiming to be remarkably early and prolific as well as\r\nexcellent in quality, and yet every one of them precisely like the old\r\nextra early Dan O’Rourke that I used to grow, I do not know how many\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThe American Wonder is the only one of the new varieties that I have\r\ntried in many years that really seems to be an acquisition to our list.\r\nIt is a dwarf about second early, and with me a good bearer, and of\r\nexcellent quality. I mention this to show the farmer that as a rule it\r\nis better for him to rely upon the old standard list, until some grower\r\nwith whom he is acquainted has fairly tested the new variety, and\r\nascertained whether or not they are worthy of cultivation, and some good\r\ncommon sense are all that is needed to insure a good farmers garden. In\r\ntwenty-five years I have failed but once to harvest at least a paying\r\ncrop of strawberries, and most of the time they have been both large and\r\nprofitable. During that time I have failed once to have a corn crop, and\r\nhave a number of times failed to have a paying crop of potatoes; in\r\nfact, I have failed oftener with my potatoes than with any other of the\r\nlong list of crops that I attempt to grow. Yet if I should say to the\r\nfarmers of this audience that they did not know how to grow a crop of\r\npotatoes, they would consider themselves insulted, though I presume that\r\nnot one of them has had complete success with them for any long series\r\nof years.\r\n\r\nPeas and onions should be put in as early as the land is in good\r\ncondition to work in the spring. If the ground freezes hard soon after\r\nthey are sprouted it will not injure them. Parsnips, beets, carrots,\r\nradishes, turnips, cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce, and salsify will all\r\nbear a little frost after they come up, but not much.\r\n\r\nCorn, beans, peppers, tomatoes, vines of all kinds, require a warm soil\r\nand will do their best in no other.\r\n\r\nA place for the wife and children’s flowers should not be forgotten or\r\nneglected. Give them a place, furnish help to prepare and care for it,\r\nand do not complain about the little time and expense it takes, either.\r\nProbably you will neither eat nor sell the flowers, but they will pay\r\nyou better than a few extra bushels of wheat would. We are apt to hear\r\ncomplaints at our conventions that the young men will persist in leaving\r\ntheir farm home and seeking a new one in some of the towns or cities.\r\nWell, when I am traveling in our own and in other States and see so many\r\ndesolate, dreary places that are called farmhouses—no trees, no\r\nshrubbery, no fruit, no flowers, no garden, in fact, nothing but a shell\r\nof a house, and some land, and it is fair to suppose that it is about as\r\ncheerless inside the house as it is dreary outside of it, I often wonder\r\nhow, or why, any bright, active, wide-awake young man can stay there one\r\nday after he is at liberty to leave.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, I know that there are many beautiful exceptions to the above\r\ndescribed homes, and that they are yearly becoming more numerous. If the\r\nexceptions could become the universal rule, what a glorious Northwest we\r\nshould have! Presidents of State agricultural societies would not have\r\nto warn their friends against attempting to get through the tangled mass\r\nof weeds called the garden. The man who has been to college would no\r\nlonger fret because his vines could not grow. The President of the State\r\nDairymen’s Association would no longer buy cabbage plants or cabbage.\r\nNeither would he be compelled to order out his team and mow his garden\r\nbefore his conscience would allow him to teach others how to farm.\r\n\r\nInstead of these, should be homes beautiful, homes bright, homes\r\nhappy—so happy that the young would be loath to leave and glad to\r\nreturn. As our Northwest is the grandest portion of our republic, so\r\nshould our homes be the most beautiful, and the inmates thereof the most\r\nintelligent as well as the happiest and most contented citizens of our\r\nwide domain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR FUTURE ORCHARDS.\r\n\r\nGranting our Apple Orchards on High lands, Ridges, and Slopes\r\nare Suffering, or Starving from Insufficient Moisture, What will\r\nbe our best course with them?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Number Four._\r\n\r\nIn the first place, it may be well to enlarge a little on the subject of\r\ndeficient moisture the average orchard is liable to on prairie and all\r\nother Western soils of a drift origin, where the strata lie nearly\r\nparallel to the plane of the earth’s surface. Here there are, therefore,\r\nfew, if any, of those springs or fountains of water which often supply\r\nabundant moisture to land of considerable slope and elevation. If this\r\ndifference in geological conditions is taken into account, it will\r\nexplain why, in many sections, orchards often do quite remarkably well\r\non hillsides and mountain slopes.\r\n\r\nThere is little or no resemblance between the apple tree and the orange\r\ntree, when both are botanically considered; but considered from the\r\npoint of view as a source of fruit, the one is the best product of warm\r\nclimates, and the other of cold ones; both being esteemed nearly\r\nuniversally. The orange being a very juicy, and at the same time, a\r\nfruit in which sweet and sour are equally blended, requires a moist soil\r\nand a large supply of water, in addition to a relatively high\r\ntemperature. Accordingly, when grown in warm but dry climates, as in\r\nSpain and along the north shore of the Mediterranean, the ground bearing\r\norange trees is uniformly copiously irrigated two or three times a\r\nmonth, during the warm season, and every two months in the winter. The\r\norange-producing portion of Louisiana is mostly confined to the sixty or\r\nseventy square miles of cultivatable land along the Mississippi river\r\nbanks, south of New Orleans. Here the soil is alluvial and sandy, the\r\nrainfall sixty or seventy inches per annum, and the state of the\r\natmosphere so continuously humid, as to drape all arboreal vegetation\r\nwith moss. Florida has the same rainfall, the same humid atmosphere, the\r\nsame moss, with the advantage of a soil quite as sandy, in which, as\r\nconstitutes elements, phosphoric acid and potash abound in far greater\r\nproportions than in the alluvial of the Mississippi. And it is probably\r\ndue to this happy association of heat, humidity, a sandy soil, rich in\r\nthe phosphates of lime and salts of potash, that Florida oranges really\r\nare, and are regarded the best in the world. But in spite of these\r\nadvantages, and another, no less important—that by capillary\r\nattraction, through the sand—the orange roots have direct and easy\r\naccess to water beneath; it is found that the trees do better if mulched\r\nto prevent evaporation during the cool months—they being the dry\r\nseason, while the summer months are the wet. The Louisiana\r\norange-growers go farther; they not only mulch liberally with rice straw\r\nevery year, but in addition, every third or fourth year, from eight\r\ninches to a foot of the earth under the trees is removed and new earth\r\nput in its place.\r\n\r\nFrom these statements we get some idea of the amount of water the orange\r\ntree demands in the soil, and the measure of moisture in the atmosphere,\r\nto supply evaporation from its large evergreen leaf surface and fill its\r\nfruit with juice. An apple tree is not an orange tree, to be sure, but\r\nwhen in leaf, and bearing a heavy crop of fruit, the farmer must\r\nnecessarily make large drafts on the soil to meet the surface\r\nevaporation and supply the required juice to its fruit. Every tree in\r\nleaf is a pump, constantly drawing on the soil and drying it, and in all\r\nreasonable probability the drafts are in proportion to fruit and\r\nfoliage. Has any body calculated the daily demand for moisture a\r\ntwenty-five-year old Northern Spy, or Baldwin, carrying twenty or thirty\r\nbushels of apples makes on the soil beneath and around it during the hot\r\nand dry months of August and September? The quantity probably is largely\r\nin excess of the common estimate, and perhaps not half required by the\r\norange—but it is so much it affords a sufficient reason why such trees\r\ngrow faster, are healthier, and bear more and better fruit, on lands\r\nthat are moist, than on lands that are dry.\r\n\r\nBut orchards on high lands, or on slopes, or on slopes and ridges,\r\nsuffering for moisture, can not be removed to low lands, nor can they be\r\nirrigated, except at an enormous expense. What then can be done? In the\r\nfirst place, the annual rainfall can be held to the space it falls upon,\r\nunder the tree, by the throwing up a furrow or ridge around it, as far\r\nout as the limbs extend, where the ground is level, and by a dam on the\r\nlower side, when the ground slopes. The latter could also be made to\r\nstay a portion of the rain falling on the higher ground above. Further:\r\na general system of mulching ought to be adopted; not for the purpose\r\nalone of keeping the surface moist, but also for supplying food to the\r\nroots as the mulch decays. If the orchard is in grass, clover, or weeds,\r\nthey should be mowed at least twice a year, the burden suffered to lie\r\non the ground and rot, or be thrown under the trees. After pruning, the\r\nwood removed should either be left where it falls, or piled in heaps\r\nabout the orchard and suffered to rot as in the “hammock” land orange\r\ngroves of Florida, where the under brush and extra timber is rarely\r\nburned, but piled in heaps to rot away.\r\n\r\nIf it is desirable to bring barren trees into bearing, or to rescue them\r\nfrom decay and death those in an unhealthy state, measures of a more\r\nradical and expensive character must be taken, measures similar to those\r\nwhich have been practiced for centuries with the grape vine, with\r\ncomplete success. These measures consist either in removing the earth\r\nunder the trees and putting new and fresh earth in its place, as\r\npracticed with orange trees in Louisiana, and on the coffee plantations\r\nin the tropics, or in digging a deep and wide ditch around the tree,\r\ninside the outer diameter of the branches, and refilling it with near\r\nhalf the earth removed and half such mineral fertilizers and amendments\r\nas tree leaves and refuse decaying vegetable matter of any sort for the\r\nother half.\r\n\r\nBut nothing more than a general outline of the course to be pursued can\r\nbe indicated here; and nothing more is necessary for the intelligent\r\namateur, fruit-grower, or orchardist, who feels the strength of the\r\nproof, and accepts the situation.\r\n\r\nIn these latter days most of the diseases which afflict humanity are\r\nbelieved to be attributable to improper nutrition and faulty hygiene,\r\nand are relieved or cured by a more or less radical change in food and\r\nhabitat.\r\n\r\nIn the animal world, the truth appears in a still stronger light;\r\nwhile in the vegetable kingdom, nutrition counts for almost everything.\r\nStill, in the case of the peach yellows and pear blight, both appear, on\r\nfirst sight, to be distinct diseases, neither yielding to any remedy yet\r\napplied to them, and both being attended with the present fashionable\r\nbacteria, which are made responsible for many diseases and all\r\nepidemics. But has anybody yet made the experiment whether water\r\nsupplied copiously to the spare and thin roots of the pear will or will\r\nnot prevent the blight, or tried the same thing with the peach? We all\r\nknow the gigantic and venerable pear trees of the Wabash and Kaskaskia\r\ncountry were planted on the sandy second bottoms of the rivers named,\r\nwhere in their early youth, if not in their mature age, water was always\r\nwithin easy reach of their roots; and we have seen the item in the\r\nagricultural papers telling how one experimenter at least, has saved his\r\npear trees from blight by copious watering. The prairie and timber\r\ncountry both are drying out and losing soil moisture very much faster\r\nthan we have any conception of. Situations where moisture in the soil\r\nwas abundant enough for all crop purposes twenty-five years ago,\r\nsuffered quickly after a brief drought now, and would be benefited by\r\nirrigation where it would have been injurious fifty years before.\r\nBeside, we have borrowed many of our ideas from the fruit-growing\r\nexperiences of the East, and they from the cooler and moister countries\r\nof Europe. And in that way the amount of right teaching has been too\r\nattenuated, until it is in many respects practically worthless.\r\n\r\n    B. F. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODEL ILLINOIS NURSERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have visited in our time very many nurseries both East and West. We\r\nhave seen those East where the elaboration of landscape gardening was\r\nmade to add effect to and set off the nursery stock grown. We have seen\r\nWest hundreds of acres covered with stock in a single nursery. Yet we\r\nhave never seen the perfection of details coupled with strict accuracy\r\nas to name in the varieties of stock grown, united to evenness and vigor\r\nin growth, nor a stricter method displayed in adaptation of varieties\r\nsuited to the climate of the West, added to the most perfect cultivation\r\nand handling of stock, than at the premium nurseries of Spaulding & Co.,\r\nnear Springfield, Ill.\r\n\r\nThese nurseries, covering 375 acres originally, of first-class land,\r\nwere thoroughly tile-drained, at heavy expense before anything was\r\nplanted thereon, the land having been first cleaned and stumped of its\r\ntimber. Thus, the groundwork having been laid for a great and model\r\nnursery, under the management of Mr. J. B. Spaulding, a well-known\r\nnurseryman of many years’ standing in Illinois, and whose practical\r\nexperience from a critical standpoint is perhaps broader than that of\r\nany man in the West, it is not strange that whenever entered for premium\r\nbefore the State Board of Agriculture, such should have been unanimously\r\nawarded by the committee of examination. This, however, the records of\r\nthe board will show.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the artistic adornment of some old and extensive\r\nnurseries East, we find this difference: In the nurseries of Mr. J. B.\r\nSpaulding the useful is never lost sight of. Mere ornament is not what\r\nstrikes the visitor, and yet the nursery is one beautiful picture in its\r\nvaried and blending colors of fruit, flowers, and foliage; for the\r\norchard and garden are by no means neglected—the visitor can find the\r\nfruits themselves, the crucial test. It is worth the journey to see.\r\n\r\nThe immense stock, the ample building, the splendid drives, the office\r\nconnected with the Western Union Telegraph lines by telephone, and\r\neverything pertaining to the great nursery, is kept in the most perfect\r\ncondition. Blight and borers are strangers to their 10,000 orchard trees\r\nof pear, peach, chestnut, and apples, all of varieties unexcelled, and\r\nadapted to the soil and climate of the West. The real gist of the whole,\r\nhowever, lies in the record of sales of this nursery for the fall\r\ndelivery just closed, which amounts to nearly $120,000.\r\n\r\nThe most gratifying success has attended the efforts of this firm in\r\ngrowing stock. Of 150,000 buds set the past season, comprising cherries,\r\npears, plums, and peaches, almost no rebudding has been required, and\r\ntheir stand is unexampled. It is not strange that the firm have the\r\napproval of the State Board of Agriculture and nurserymen of experience\r\nEast and West, especially from the large nurseries proprietors of\r\nWestern New York. All unite in saying Spaulding & Co.’s grounds,\r\ncomprising upward of 375 acres, thoroughly tile-drained, for the growing\r\nof nursery stock, are unsurpassed. The 1,500,000 one, two, and\r\nthree-year old apple trees, and 175,000 one, two, and three-year old\r\ncherry trees—the latter budded on Mahaleb roots, imported from\r\nFrance—together with their enormous stock of evergreens, pears, roses,\r\nshrubs, etc., are matchless in their perfection of growth, whether it be\r\nfrom an Eastern or Western standpoint.\r\n\r\nIn driving through the nursery we were shown a large block of American\r\nchestnuts, from five to eight feet high, and thence were driven to the\r\nchestnut orchard nearly all in bearing. The chestnut here seems fully as\r\nmuch at home as any other plant cultivated.\r\n\r\nFor the protection of their patrons against outside imposition, each of\r\ntheir nearly one hundred selected salesmen are accredited with a\r\ncertificate of agency.\r\n\r\nThe long experience of this firm, being nearly thirty years in the\r\nbusiness at Springfield, Ill.; the reputation they enjoy; the approval\r\nand indorsement they receive from the State—all commend this nursery to\r\nthe favorable attention of those who have ground upon which to plant\r\nshrubbery or trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BASKET WILLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nA correspondent wishes some information about the basket willow. In\r\nOnondaga county, Central New York, this willow is cultivated and\r\nmanufactured on a large scale and is, in fact, a leading industry. The\r\ncultivation is increasing very rapidly and is a great benefit to this\r\nand neighboring counties. The baskets made from this willow are better\r\nand cheaper than the splint basket, and raising the stock is found to\r\npay much better than other farm crops, while the manufacture gives\r\nemployment to hundreds of men, women, and children, who would otherwise\r\nhave nothing to do during the winter.\r\n\r\nThese willows are grown on high land and on low land, on wet and dry\r\nland, and on very cheap land, and on land that is worth one thousand\r\ndollars per acre. The crop needs to be planted but once, and an average\r\nyearly crop can not be worth less than one hundred dollars per acre. As\r\nthe timber suitable for baskets is getting scarce and dear, it is plain\r\nthat the demand for willow will increase every year. In most parts of\r\nthe country are Germans who understand working the willow, and it is a\r\ngreat benefit to them and to their neighbors to have this industry\r\nintroduced. Not one farmer in a dozen has on his place as many baskets\r\nas he needs, for the reason that they are scarce and dear. This willow\r\nis the easiest thing in the world to raise, and yet we import from\r\nEurope $5,000,000 worth a year.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred tons of willow are manufactured every year in one\r\nlittle village in this State. One man in Syracuse told me he should send\r\nto New York this winter one hundred and forty tons of peeled willow,\r\nmostly of his own growing. In all the large cities more or less willow\r\nis manufactured every year, and the amount thus worked in the city of\r\nMilwaukee is very large. This industry is a benefit to the whole\r\ncommunity and deserves to be encouraged, and the West especially should\r\ntake a deep interest in extending it. The fact that it gives employment\r\nto poor during the winter, thus making comfort take the place of want,\r\nshould exert a great influence in its favor. Here then is a means by\r\nwhich the farmer can put money in his pocket and help his poor neighbor\r\nat the same time. I have no interest in this matter as I do not raise,\r\nbuy, or sell, but I do know it has been a great blessing to our State.\r\nThere is one variety grown here that is much preferred to any other, but\r\nI can not find out the true name for it. Even the man that brought it\r\nhere does not know its name.\r\n\r\nIn a future number I will give directions for planting, etc.\r\n\r\n    A. M. WILLIAMS\r\n        LONG ISLAND, N.

Ross, this week tells farmers how they\r\nmay keep their pork fresh for summer use. It will be generally\r\nregretted, we fear, that Mr. Ross did not contribute this article\r\nearlier in the season. It is timely to those who have not yet salted\r\ntheir pork, and for those who have, the recipe will keep, as well as the\r\npork, until another season. Do you all file THE PRAIRIE FARMER?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Smiths have it this week! We mean J. M. and J. A., one in the\r\nHorticultural and the other in the Dairy department of THE PRAIRIE\r\nFARMER. If any agricultural paper of this week contains two more\r\nvaluable essays than these two, that is the publication we should like\r\nto see. The dairymen have a little the best of it, for dairymen all need\r\ngood gardens, and hence both essays meet their cases, but the “Farmer’s\r\nGarden” is alone worth the subscription price of the paper to every\r\nfarmer. Ought not the dairymen to subscribe for two copies?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf you are an active young man or young woman, or if you are not so\r\nyoung and active as you used to be, do not sit down and say to yourself\r\nthat you can not secure some prize as offered in our premium list.

We propose to give away a great deal of\r\nmoney value in these prizes, and the more we are called upon to give the\r\nbetter we like it, for we know that while increasing our list we are at\r\nthe same time widening the influence of the paper and conferring\r\nbenefits upon the country.

At Huddersfield the other day two\r\nowners secured the tail-ends of their carts together and then put their\r\nteams to the draft to see which would give way. First one and then the\r\nother was drawn backward, “_while the macadam was torn up to the depth\r\nof five inches by their struggles_.” The horses were kicked and beaten\r\nto make them do their best. The London Live Stock Journal says the\r\nbrutes, the men we mean, not the horses, were arrested and fined $5 each\r\nfor their fun. It should have been $500 apiece and imprisonment. The\r\nwhipping post is none too severe for such criminal inhumanity to man’s\r\nmost useful animal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrance has about one-half the agricultural implements in use that\r\nEngland has, though the cultivated acres in France are greatly in excess\r\nof those of England. The reason, doubtless, lies in the fact that French\r\nfarms are very small and do not warrant the purchase of the larger\r\nlabor-saving machines. The manual labor of the members of the family is\r\noften sufficient to carry on almost all the operations of the little\r\nfarm “patches.” The late French census gives the following list of\r\nimplements: 4,800,000 plow and diggers of various kinds, 1,650,000\r\nharrows, 20,000 drills, 15,000 mowing machines, 18,000 reapers, 60,000\r\nchaff-cutters, and 55,000 root-cutters. As compared with our own country\r\nthis is indeed a small showing. We have dozens of reaper factories that\r\nturn out yearly more machines than are owned in all France.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOur readers will notice that in our premium list, as sent out last week,\r\nthe Saskatchewan fife wheat is among the prominent offers. Here is a\r\npointer showing the estimation in which the wheat is held by those who\r\nhave grown it. We take it from the Detroit Record: “Last Spring\r\ntwenty-six members of the Becker County Farmers’ Union clubbed together\r\nto the extent of $5 each for the purpose of giving the Scotch fife wheat\r\n(as grown in the Saskatchawan Valley) a trial, and the result has been\r\nmost satisfactory. Thirteen bushels of the wheat were bought at $10 per\r\nbushel, and Iver Christianson, of Richwood, sowed it on thirteen acres\r\nof new land, for one-fourth of the yield. The wheat was threshed last\r\nWednesday and divided among the stockholders yesterday, each receiving\r\ntwelve bushels for his investment of five dollars, the total yield being\r\n403 bushels, 61 pounds to the bushel, of the finest quality of No. 1\r\nhard. Mr. Wellman, of whom the said wheat was purchased, began growing\r\nthe wheat several years ago from a few kernels received in a letter from\r\nthe Saskatchawan Valley, and the grain has been hand picked and kept\r\nperfectly clean each year.” The members of the club express themselves\r\nas perfectly satisfied with results and indorse the wheat in the highest\r\nmanner. In all our premiums we have aimed to select useful articles, and\r\nsuch as are calculated to meet the wants of farmers and friends.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Northern Illinois Horticultural Society held an interesting meeting\r\nat Elgin last week. The attendance was not large, but included such life\r\nlong leaders in Illinois horticulture as A. R. Whitney, S. G. Minkler,\r\nJ. W. Cochrane, D. C. Schofield, A. Bryant, Jr., Dr. Slade, Wm. Kellogg,\r\nof Wisconsin, D. Wilmot Scott, H. Graves, A. L. Small, L. Woodard, and\r\nothers. The papers read were brief and excellent. Robert Douglas, O. B.\r\nGalusha, and Samuel Edwards, who were not present contributed\r\ninstructive essays. The election for the ensuing year resulted in the\r\nchoice of S. M. Slade, Elgin, President; A. Bryant, Jr., Princeton, J.\r\nV. Cotta, Mt. Carroll, and David Hill, Dundee, Vice-Presidents; D.\r\nWilmot Scott, Galena, Secretary; E. W. Graves, Sandwich, and J. S.\r\nRodgers, Marengo, Recording Secretaries. The society voted to hold its\r\nnext annual meeting at Elgin. We will give a digest of proceedings in\r\nnext week’s paper.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe alleged operations of certain patent sharks as recorded on third\r\npage of this paper reminds us of a couple of swindling operations\r\nhumorously noticed in a late New York Tribune, viz: Certain Michigan\r\nfarmers gave their notes, ranging from $50 to $500 each, for “hulless\r\noats,” payment to be made out of the crop produced at $1.50 per bushel.\r\nBut the I. O. U.’s were promptly sold on liberal terms at the bank or\r\nelsewhere. The persuasive agent “lighted out,” and the victims now think\r\nthey perceive symptoms of the cutting of belated teeth, of the eye\r\nvariety. Another interesting “little game” is this: Two men, apparently\r\nstrangers, meet at a farm-house; get acquainted; arrange to stay over\r\nnight. During the long evening they make a bargain with each other for\r\nsome piece of property, draw writings, and ask their host kindly to\r\nappend his name as witness. Just as might have been expected, the\r\nfarmer’s signature turns out to be the most important of the three,\r\nsince the document is so artfully constructed that by cutting it in two\r\npieces one of them becomes a promissory note, which is subsequently\r\nnegotiated, and, under the present bad law, has to be paid.—In view of\r\nsuch occurrences as these (still astonishingly common after years of\r\nrepeated exposure by the press) the aggressive “Jabez” of the Tribune\r\nmaintains that the countryman who doesn’t treat as frauds all tramps, no\r\nmatter how well dressed, who seek his autograph, under any pretense\r\nwhatever, would better have given his time to reading and not learned to\r\nwrite, for these bad signs indicate that he will never be forethoughtful\r\nenough in such emergencies to make his mark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISSISSIPPI VALLEY HORT. SOCIETY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fifth annual meeting of the Mississippi Valley Horticultural Society\r\nheld at Kansas City, Mo., January 22-25, was the most interesting and\r\nprofitable ever held by this vigorous and valuable organization.\r\nDelegates were present from fourteen States, covering the great\r\nwater-shed embraced by the “Father of Waters,” and its tributaries—in\r\nand of itself, an empire. The personnel of this body was excellent; it\r\nwas a convention of practical, brainy men, alive to the interests of one\r\nof the most important pursuits in range of the rural industries. The\r\nessays, and the discussions they provoked, were full of interest, and\r\nhighly instructive. We have attended scores of such assemblies during\r\nthe last quarter of a century; none of them equaled this, all things\r\nconsidered, and we think this opinion was shared by the oldest and most\r\nprominent among those in attendance.\r\n\r\nOur columns, as we find on our return home, are too crowded this week to\r\nadmit of publishing a synopsis of the proceedings, but will make room\r\nfor the eloquent, touching, and well-deserved tribute of the society to\r\nthe memory of Dr. John A. Warder. Next week an epitome of the work of\r\nthe convention will be given, and two of the papers that were read will\r\nalso appear, to wit: “The Best Fruit Packages,” by E. T. Hollister, of\r\nSt. Louis, Mo., and “The Educational Influence of Horticulture,” by Mr.\r\nG. A. Lyon, of Galesburg, Ill. Other valuable and interesting papers\r\nread at this meeting will soon appear in THE PRAIRIE FARMER; among\r\nthem, Prof. S. A. Forbes’ paper on “Insects Affecting the Strawberry”\r\n(which is supplemental to a former paper which we published last year);\r\nanother by Prof. John W. Robson, of Cheever, Kansas, on the “Circulation\r\nof Sap,” and others which are very useful, on various leading\r\nhorticultural topics.\r\n\r\nThe re-election of Parker Earle, as President, W. H. Ragan, Secretary,\r\nand T. C. Evans, Treasurer, was a fitting indorsement of the faithful\r\nand efficient services of these officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN IT IS TIME TO RESIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe observe a general tendency this winter to re-elect about all the old\r\nofficers of the various dairy, horticultural and other meetings, and\r\nthis regardless of age or previous terms of office. While this practice\r\nis highly complimentary to men who have held the positions, and is a\r\nrecognition of services well performed, we think the more frequent\r\ninfusion of new blood an excellent remedy for stagnation and other ills\r\nliable to creep into association management. At several meetings this\r\nwinter writers and speakers have expressed regret that more young men\r\nwere not in attendance. Perhaps if the old members were a little more\r\nwilling to give young men a fair proportion of the management there\r\nwould be less cause of complaint in this direction. We have often\r\nwondered at the tenacity with which some old and otherwise sensible men\r\nhold on to offices in State agricultural societies. They indeed seem to\r\nthink it a personal slight if they fail of renomination. We have in mind\r\none clever old gentleman, now in almost every way ill-fitted for the\r\nposition, who has for long years held the office of president of a State\r\nAssociation. Every member of the organization is aware that the days of\r\nthis old gentleman’s usefulness in the position have long since passed\r\naway, yet he was re-elected almost by acclamation at a late annual\r\nmeeting. It was remarked, in our hearing, that some younger, more\r\nvigorous and active man should be selected, “but,” it was added, “it\r\nwould break the old man’s heart to put another man in his place, and\r\nthat is the way all feel about it.” Such a sentiment speaks well for the\r\nhearts of the members with whom the old gentleman is associated, but\r\nless can be said of the judgment that is manifested. We respect age,\r\nespecially if it has been attained while doing good service for the\r\npublic. But something is due to the present and the future as well as to\r\nthe past. It is to be regretted that men do not better recognize the\r\nfact that these little affairs of the world would move along just about\r\nas well if their management were sometimes resigned to other hands\r\nbefore death compels the change. But such is seldom the case. We have\r\nknown a man, once a president of a State Agricultural Society and long\r\none of its vice-presidents, who has really felt that many of his old\r\nfriends and associates became his personal enemies the moment they aided\r\nin electing another man to his position. He thinks them so still, yet\r\nthe fact is he has no more faithful, well-wishing friends on earth. It\r\nwas one of those cases where public good demanded the sacrifice of\r\nprivate preference. It will be better for all our organizations when\r\nsuch adherence to correct principles universally prevails, or when\r\nfailing faculties bring with them self-consciousness of weakening\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOCATING THE MINNESOTA STATE\r\nFAIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Minnesota State Agricultural Association is now working under the\r\nprovisions of the new law passed by the Legislature last year. This law\r\nentitles to vote delegates in the management of the State Society, from\r\neach county association holding a fair and paying premiums to the amount\r\nof the donation by the State to these local organizations. At the late\r\nmeeting at St. Paul over twenty county societies were represented. It\r\nwas also decided to allow one vote each to the State Horticultural\r\nSociety, and to the Southern Minnesota Fair Association.\r\n\r\nThe financial report showed that the State Society received from all\r\nsources in 1883 the sum of $14,068.78. The disbursements amounted to a\r\nlittle less than this sum. As it is a matter of interest everywhere to\r\nknow what it costs, by items, to run a State society, we here give them\r\nfor Minnesota: Salaries of officers and assistants, $3,601.39; printing\r\nand advertising, $1,415.65; general expenses, $2,520.97; special ring\r\npurses, $2,434; premiums, $3,945.50.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that a little over sixty-one per cent of the whole\r\namount of prize money went to the fast horse interest. Thus it is\r\nconsidered in Minnesota that racing is worth more money to the State\r\nFair, that is, it brings more money from attendance and “privileges,”\r\nthan all the cattle, farm horses, swine, sheep, fowls, farm products,\r\nvegetables, flowers, machinery, fine arts, domestic products, and\r\neverything else that can be brought out at the State exhibition. We do\r\nnot take Minnesota as an example because it is any better or any worse\r\nthan other States in this respect, but to show to the farming people of\r\nthis country wherein lie the attractions of the modern agricultural\r\nfair. They are at liberty to draw their own conclusions. These fairs are\r\nin their own hands, or should be, and if reforms are needed it is from\r\nthem that they must emanate.\r\n\r\nFor several years there has been a feeling of intense rivalry between\r\nthe Fair Association at Minneapolis and the State Society. The rival\r\nfairs have been held at the same time, and the result has been\r\ndetrimental to both organizations. We suppose the feeling had its birth\r\nin the commercial rivalry between the cities of St. Paul and\r\nMinneapolis. However this may have been, or whether good or ill has\r\nresulted, the State Society and the farmers of the State are to be\r\ncongratulated that a movement is on foot to obliterate all differences,\r\nand to establish somewhere between the cities of St. Paul and\r\nMinneapolis permanent fair grounds that shall secure to Minnesota one of\r\nthe greatest fairs of the Northwest. At the meeting, about which we\r\nbegan to write, it was resolved to instruct a committee, appointed for\r\nthe purpose, to negotiate with the citizens of the two cities for eighty\r\nor one hundred acres of land for a permanent location of the State\r\nSociety. It was also advocated to call upon the Legislature for\r\nappropriations for the construction of permanent buildings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWAYSIDE NOTES.\r\n\r\nBY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI can’t help remarking to myself as I read my two or three foreign\r\nagricultural papers, how great is becoming the influence of American\r\nagriculture upon the farming of Great Britain. Our ways are gradually\r\ninsinuating themselves into British practice and it will not be long\r\nbefore our respected “cousins” will be ready to acknowledge that we have\r\nin great part paid off the debt we owe them for the many lessons in\r\nmethods of thorough culture and intelligent breeding they have given us.\r\nWhat has led me to mention this matter is an item in a London journal\r\nshowing a tendency to bring beef stock to the block at an earlier age\r\nthan has formerly prevailed in that country. It was not until\r\ninaugurated at the Chicago Fat Stock Show, I believe, that the English\r\never took it into their heads to make a record of average daily gain of\r\nbullocks for their Fat Stock Shows, or of the amount of food it took to\r\nbring them into show condition. It is only lately that stock raisers\r\nthere have thought about selling by weight instead of the “guess” of the\r\nbuyer. Farm scales are not half enough in use here, but we are manifold\r\nahead of the farmers of Great Britain in this respect. It was only after\r\nAmericans had pronounced upon the benefits of the silo that British\r\nfarmers thought it worth their while to experiment with the innovation\r\nfrom across the channel. But about this early maturity question: I\r\nnotice that a correspondent of the Yorkshire Post mentions that at the\r\nlate Fat Stock Show two Prize Hereford bullocks weighing (dressed) 896\r\npounds, and 700 pounds, were aged respectively one year, nine months,\r\nand five days, and one year, seven months, and twenty-two days. At the\r\nGrimsby show there were two Short-horns weighing 14 cwt. and 13¾ cwt.\r\nlive weight, the first being one year and nine months old, and the other\r\none year, nine months, and fourteen days. They took the second prize as\r\ngrazing steers. I don’t need to mention anything about the new farm\r\nimplements we have given the old country, nor the many modifications\r\nthat her own implements, wagons, etc., are undergoing, especially in the\r\nway of lightness in construction, that are directly traceable to the\r\ninfluence of American manufacture. Indeed, if the intelligent and\r\nunprejudiced Englishman of to-day who is familiar with our agriculture\r\nwill sit down and reflect upon the subject he will readily acknowledge\r\nthat the influence of the United States upon the political ideas of\r\nEngland has not been more marked than it has upon her agricultural ideas\r\nand practices.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd while I have strayed so far away from home for a subject for a\r\n“note” I may as well stay there long enough to say that the English dog\r\nis not a whit less fond of mutton than is the average canine of this\r\ncountry. And further, it does not seem that British law regarding the\r\nprotection of sheep is at all in advance of ours, either in its\r\nprovisions or the manner of its enforcement. In Cheshire, for instance,\r\ndogs, in the course of the first two weeks of this year, killed 140\r\nsheep valued at $1,500, and the most that was done about it was to hunt\r\nup the offending cur—no it was not a cur but a Retriever—and kill it.\r\nThe dog is a great favorite in England, certainly he seems there as here\r\nto have more friends than the sheep that clothes and feeds. When will\r\nman, anywhere, become fully civilized and humanized?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI met a Wisconsin tobacco and corn-grower the other day, and he was\r\nbluer than a pipe stem. The frost last fall cut off both his corn and\r\nhis tobacco. He said he had actually nothing to sell but a little\r\nwrapper tobacco which grew in a protected place, and now the Government\r\nhad nipped his hopes for this in the bud by declaring that Sumatra\r\ntobacco should be admitted into the country on a duty of 35 cents per\r\npound, while it is acknowledged that it is worth at least five times as\r\nmuch as the best Wisconsin with which it competes. Probably a later\r\ndecision by Secretary Folger that this Sumatra leaf must pay 75 cents\r\nper pound has done one of his sores some good. The only thing I could\r\nthen, or can now, recommend as good for the other—caused by the\r\nuntimely frost—is, that he no longer put all his eggs in one or two\r\nbaskets. I am convinced that for farmers of moderate means through the\r\nacceptance of the doctrine of diversified farming alone lies their\r\npermanent and universal salvation from financial hades in this world.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the Punjaub, British India, there was last year an outbreak of the\r\ncattle plague. The authorities took hold of the matter, and by means of\r\nisolation of affected cattle and the prescriptions of the veterinarians,\r\nthe disease was completely eradicated. The authorities were jubilant\r\nover their success. The natives were congratulated on being ruled over\r\nby a Government which kept such excellent watch over their interests.\r\nBut the natives, while they admitted the existence of the disease,\r\nwherein they were more intelligent or less prejudiced than are some of\r\nour citizens regarding pleuro-pneumonia, did not have a much better\r\nopinion of the vets and commissioners than your correspondent, B. F. J.,\r\nseems to have. They said to an official: “Yes, sahib, the isolation of\r\ncattle gave great trouble, and the salutries’ hunger was difficult to\r\nappease. When they had left the village, we got a holy man, who drew a\r\nline on the ground round the herd. Then he got on horseback and rode\r\nround the herd, sprinkling water and repeating the creed. It was that\r\nwhich cured the cattle.” What we farmers want is the isolation and the\r\nvets.’ advice, and if Mr. Allerton and Gen. Singleton have a “holy man”\r\nat command to draw a line about the infected herds, perhaps we can get\r\nrid of the disease, and thus all parties will be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER FROM CHAMPAIGN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now (January 25) had forty days of snow, and nearly\r\nuninterrupted good sleighing, and the end is not yet—neither of snow\r\nnor sleighing, for there is fully a foot of the former now on the\r\nground, and few, if any, bare spots. But the steady cold is quite as\r\nuncommon as the snow or sleighing, and will make the winter of 1883-84 a\r\nmemorable one. Another remarkable feature is the low range of the\r\nthermometer where mild winters are thought to be insured by the\r\nlatitude. Thus, Central and Southern Kansas and Missouri have had as\r\ncold weather as Central Illinois—a good example of which was the 27\r\ndegrees below zero registered at Makanda, a few miles north of Cobden,\r\nIll., while the lowest point reached, 200 miles further north, was only\r\na degree or two lower. It may be winter will break up soon—and it may\r\nbe deeper snows and intenser cold are in store for us, as in some other\r\nwinters of great severity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the protracted cold and snow which takes all pasturage out\r\nof the account in carrying stock, is making very heavy drafts on hay,\r\ngrain, and fodder of all kinds and it looks now as if the big hay crop\r\nof this section will be fed out before spring. As for corn, the most of\r\nwhich is soft and has no grade and no sale as a merchantable commodity,\r\nexcept for feeding where it grew—is being very lavishly fed to stock of\r\nall kinds, as the most profitable way to get rid of it. Accounts from\r\nNebraska and Northwest Kansas report corn in very little better\r\ncondition than in Central Illinois, and dealers who bought and cribbed\r\nit early in the season are reputed badly caught.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is nothing new to report in respect to the condition of winter\r\nwheat. So long as snow covers the ground it is safe; and after, it will\r\ncome through if the weather is warm, or cold and wet, and there is\r\nlittle freezing and thawing to thaw it out of the ground. It is thought\r\nby those who have given the subject some attention, that though the buds\r\nof fruit trees may be killed or badly damaged by the intense cold, and\r\nthough the wood was not thoroughly ripened last year, the ground not\r\nbeing frozen and the earth being covered by snow at the time, the\r\nvitality of the trees will remain unimpaired. It is the experience of\r\nVermont and Maine orchardists, that if snow falls before the ground\r\nfreezes to any considerable depth, apple trees effectually resist any\r\ndegree of cold.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe latest contribution of facts going to establish the new departure in\r\nrespect to the location of orchards, comes from a farmer of Geauga\r\ncounty, Ohio. He writes to the Country Gentleman of a late date as\r\nfollows: “There was little fruit the past season, and as in many former\r\nyears, orchards on high lands bore only a few defective apples. Such\r\norchards have not borne much for several years, while orchards on low\r\nlands, somewhat protected, have borne large crops of fair fruit. My\r\norchards on low land, protected by evergreens, have brought me several\r\nhundred dollars a year for several years, while the orchards on high\r\nlands, a little west, have not borne enough for family use for some\r\nyears.” Who will tell THE PRAIRIE FARMER about the many orchards of\r\nLivingston county, Ill., which produced, last year, very remarkable\r\ncrops of fine apples—a fact which raised the value of land in that\r\ncounty several dollars per acre?\r\n\r\n    B. F. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ELOQUENT TRIBUTE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following eloquent tribute to the late Dr. John A. Warder was\r\nwritten by ex-Gov. J. Sterling Morton, of Nebraska, chairman of the\r\nmemorial committee at the late meeting of the Mississippi Valley\r\nHorticultural Society at Kansas City. In its estimation of the man and\r\nhis work it is appreciative and just: Ingersoll himself could not\r\nsurpass it in the sublimity of its pathos. To be thus commemorated in\r\nthe minds and words of men is the lot of few, and those only who have\r\nlived exalted, useful lives, and whose glowing hearts have kindled the\r\nfires of friendship and love in the breasts of friends and associates in\r\nlife’s cares and labors. Mr. Morton said:\r\n\r\nAs guests register their names at a hotel, depart, and are forgotten, so\r\nhumanity, stopping for a short time on the earth, makes its autograph\r\nupon the age and sets out upon its returnless journey to that realm\r\nwhence come neither tidings nor greetings.\r\n\r\nEach individual of the race leaves some trace of his existence on the\r\ngeneration in which he lives, and considerable numbers transmit their\r\nnames to posterity italicised in good deeds or embalmed in noble and\r\nelevating thought.\r\n\r\nThe desire to be remembered and esteemed by those who come after us,\r\nseems to be, with the better and more exalted minds, a greater\r\ninspiration to high intellectual effort than the mere plaudits of\r\ncotemporaries. As on the stage, those actors who play best their parts\r\nare recalled and applauded after the curtain has fallen, so those in the\r\nbrief drama of life, who have best performed their duties are, after\r\ntheir mortal costumes have been forever laid away in restful graves,\r\nagain called out by their admiring cotemporaries, and thus their\r\nintellectual and moral personalities reappear before the lights, amidst\r\ntumultuous and emulative applause.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty and pleasure of your committee, gentlemen of the\r\nMississippi Valley Horticultural Society, in harmony with this line of\r\nreflection, to bring before you the character and services of the\r\nrecently deceased Dr. John A. Warder, of Ohio. His naturally strong\r\nmental faculties were led out and trained, in school and college, to a\r\nfull and vigorous stature. His chosen profession of medicine, in the\r\nearlier years of his manhood, occupied his entire thought and stimulated\r\nhim to untiring labor of mind and body, and, at the same time, gave him\r\nalso that culture of the heart which, through his refined, emotional\r\nnature, was ever incarnating itself in delicate acts of kindness and\r\ngenerosity toward those who needed sympathy or friends.\r\n\r\nBut he turned at last from his professional studies—from the books in\r\nhis library—to those broader investigations of the mysteries of life\r\nand growth of flowers, fruits and forests, to which the fields,\r\norchards, and wild woods of Ohio ever allured him. His childhood and\r\nyouth had passed amidst the rustic scenes of a home in the country, on a\r\nfarm; and as the seashell, though ever so long and far away from its\r\nhome in the surf, will, when placed to the ear always moan of its ocean\r\nhome, so his great and tender soul ever yearned for a life among the\r\nflora and sylvia of youth. His brave and benignant spirit explored all\r\navenues of knowledge which led into flowering fields and orchards. To\r\nhis eye every blossom was a poem; to his quick perception every tree a\r\nbook full of useful and agreeable teachings. And to the study of these\r\nvolumes—these continued annuals—fresh in new binding, embellishment,\r\nand gilding every summer and autumn, Dr. Warder devoted the choicest\r\nyears of his mature manhood.\r\n\r\nIt is the enthusiast of a cause who gives vitality and propulsive power.\r\nDr. Warder was an enthusiast in horticulture and in forestry. To advance\r\nthe race in those two vocations no labor was too great for him to\r\nundertake, no sacrifice too severe for him joyfully to make. At his own\r\nexpense he went into fresh territories and States, preaching, as a\r\nmissionary of a new gospel, the importance and necessity of orcharding\r\nand tree planting. His thoughts were strewn, like precious seeds, among\r\nthe dwellers on the prairies of Nebraska, Dakota, Wyoming, Minnesota and\r\nthe Northwest. And they took root, so that the concepts of thousands of\r\ngroves and orchards, which now stand as living monuments to his useful\r\nlife, came from his own philanthropic brain. In his mind miniature\r\nforests grew on every prairie, and golden fruit flashed in the autumn\r\nsunlight of every hill-side. He knew no limit to his love of\r\nhorticulture and arboriculture. He was earnest; he was active, sincere,\r\nand his vitægraph is written wherever flowers bloom, fruits ripen, and\r\nforests wave all over the country he loved so well and served so\r\nmodestly, efficiently, and faithfully.\r\n\r\nHis example is worthy of the emulation of our sons and of their sons.\r\nAnd standing at his grave it is meet and proper for this society to\r\nrecall his noble services to its cause, to wish that, with each\r\nrecurring year his memory may, like the flowers and foliage he studied\r\nso well, be clothed in new verdure and its fragrance perpetuated as a\r\ngrateful perfume.\r\n\r\nResolved—That the Mississippi Valley Horticultural Society deplores the\r\ndeath of its friend and active member, Dr. John A. Warder of Ohio; that\r\nour sincere condolence is extended to his family, and that we recommend\r\nto kindred societies throughout the Northwest the planting of memorial\r\ntrees and groves to commemorate his labors, his achievements, and his\r\nphilanthropy as a skilled orchardist and forester.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF A SITE FOR A PARK.\r\n\r\n(_Continued from Page 65._)\r\n\r\n\r\nwere squatters of the lowest class living in hovels. The construction of\r\nthe Central Park, and the opening of the streets in its neighborhood,\r\nchanged the whole character of the surrounding region. In the ten years\r\nsucceeding the commencement of work upon the park, the increased\r\nvaluation of taxable property in the wards immediately adjacent was no\r\nless than fifty-four millions of dollars, affording a surplus of three\r\nmillions after paying the interest on all the city bonds issued for the\r\npurchase and construction of the park, a sum sufficient if used as a\r\nsinking fund to pay the entire principal and interest of the cost of the\r\npark in less time than was required for its construction.\r\n\r\nA similar instance of the profitable conversion of a deserted and\r\nforbidding region into a rich and elegant quarter of a city, is afforded\r\nby the Park des Butte Chaumont in Paris.\r\n\r\nIt occupies the site of old abandoned slate quarries, the precipitous\r\nwalls and rough excavations of which have been converted into\r\npicturesque scenery by judicious treatment and tasteful planting, so as\r\nto give it the appearance of a wild mountain gorge. The result has been\r\nthat its vicinity has become a rich and elegant quarter, simply because\r\nit has been made attractive to the large and constantly growing class\r\nwho are seeking pleasant residence sites within easy access of their\r\nplaces of business.\r\n\r\nThese illustrations will suffice to prove the truth of my assertion,\r\nthat the objects of most essential importance to a city in the creation\r\nof a park will be attained by selecting for its location a site which is\r\nnaturally undesirable or even repulsive and converting it into an\r\nattractive quarter, rather than one which combines all the elements of\r\nbeauty and health, and as a consequence is so desirable for residences,\r\nthat it can only be had at great cost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Illinois State Dairymen’s Association will hold its next annual\r\nmeeting at Champaign, December 17-19, 1884.

We have fifty or sixty spring pullets hatched in April and May,\r\nfrom which by this time we expected to get eggs plentifully, and it\r\nstretches our patience to get only from one to five eggs per day. They\r\nhave an underground room with only the front exposed, well lighted, and\r\nwe have fed them till they are fat.\r\n\r\nWe feed them a warm breakfast of potatoes and bran, or oats ground, with\r\na little pepper occasionally, then an hour or two later oats, and again\r\nat night oats or corn, about three times a week. Plaster, coal, and\r\ngravel are liberally supplied. They have milk and now and then powdered\r\nbones, or refuse meat, cooked.\r\n\r\nBy an accident a fine one of over four pounds’ weight was killed, and I\r\nhad supposed she ought to lay as she was one of my earliest, but on\r\ninvestigation I found eggs from a hickory nut down to shot eggs, that\r\nwere black or dark and hard, and I readily conjectured if the rest were\r\nlike her it was not strange we had no eggs. Please tell us the cause and\r\ncure.\r\n\r\nOur fowls are mixed, light and dark Brahmas, Leghorns and everything you\r\nwould get by changing eggs with the neighbors. We have added Plymouth\r\nRocks of late, having more of them than any other. We save the best Rock\r\nroosters each year. It is the more surprising as our fowls usually lay\r\nwell.\r\n\r\nPlease help us if you can, and oblige a subscriber.\r\n\r\n    MRS. C. H. R.\r\n        MARENGO, IOWA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT DUCK FARM.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR FANNY FIELD—I have often thought I would write you through our\r\ndear old PRAIRIE FARMER, but the old thief, procrastination, stole my\r\ntime. But reading your description of “A Duck Farm” aroused all the\r\nambition I have, and the editor willing (I not being one of the number\r\nknowing your private address) would like to ask a few questions I\r\nconsider “necessary,” and will promise to abide by the terms given in\r\n“Chats with Correspondents” of January 5th, as near as possible.\r\n\r\nI don’t wonder the woman owning the “duck farm” wished to withhold her\r\nname and whereabouts from the public generally, besides guarding her pen\r\nwith “well-trained dogs” if she has ducks she can induce to lay 125 or\r\neven 100 eggs per season, nine and one third of which will hatch out\r\nducklings that will all live to be grown ducks.\r\n\r\nTake an average of 113 and the ducks will lay 1,808 eggs per season, and\r\nshe sells $100 worth at $3 per doz. making 400; then she sends 24 doz.\r\nto New York, then raises “1,100 ducks on the place,” making in all,\r\n1,788, which, taken from the 1,808 leaves 20 eggs for non-hatchers and\r\ndead ducklings. This I call pretty close work.\r\n\r\nI have had some little experience with ducks, and I can only get them to\r\nlay from sixty to seventy eggs per season, and about one eighth of the\r\neggs don’t hatch (from various causes) and about the same amount of\r\nducklings die. Now if you will be kind enough to reveal the woman’s\r\nwhereabouts to me I would like to invest if she will warrant them to\r\ncome up to your figures; also, is the said woman a widow?\r\n\r\nNow Miss Fanny (if such you are) please excuse my familiarity. As I have\r\nperused your writings with such pleasure, I feel well acquainted, so\r\nstrike me as hard as you please, but remember there is a hereafter. I\r\nhave several facts in regard to my fowls for another time providing I\r\ngain admission.\r\n\r\n    A. SUCKER.\r\n        DE WITT CO., ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM NEW HAMPSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nEggs are worth thirty-three cents per dozen here. The hens are not\r\nlaying nearly as many as they were at this time last year. Can any one\r\ntell the reason? Farmers ought to pay more attention to the hens. They\r\ndo pay, and pay big if properly cared for. Give them hot feed in the\r\nmorning, consisting of bran, corn meal, beef scraps, a little salt and a\r\nlittle cayenne pepper. Don’t make them drink ice water these cold days.\r\nGive them wheat and oats at noon, and whole corn at night. The warmer\r\nyour house is the more profit you will reap. I don’t care whether your\r\nfowls are pure bloods or not, if you take good care of them they will\r\ngive you eggs. A good neighbor of mine says that his pure Plymouth Rocks\r\ndo not lay as many eggs as his common “old fashioned” fowls.\r\n\r\nShall I raise a tempest among the breeders?\r\n\r\n    G. G. A.\r\n        HUDSON, N. H.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTHE APIARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN-SILK PROTECTION.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of “Gleanings” writes: I winter on the summer stands,\r\nand pack them a little differently from most persons. I spread the combs\r\nso that eight or nine will fill same space occupied in summer by ten.\r\nThen placing sticks crosswise of the frames, to allow a passway for the\r\nbees, I spread a cloth above them, and pack on the top of this two or\r\nthree inches of corn-silks. For packing, these are superior to anything\r\nI have yet seen or heard of. They are clean, and excellent\r\nnon-conductors, and will more readily absorb the moisture than either\r\nchaff or saw-dust, and yet remain perfectly dry. They are easily\r\ncollected by a boy when men are husking in the fields; and when taken\r\noff in the spring can be stored away for another winter. Knowing the\r\nvalue of them by experience, I hope that many of our brother bee-keepers\r\nwill give them a fair trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEEDING BACK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of “feeding back” honey to bees was discussed at the\r\nMichigan State Convention at Flint. W. Z. Hutchinson had had a poor\r\nseason; but as he had mentioned incidentally that he had practiced\r\n“feeding back,” it brought down upon him a shower of questions. In\r\nfeeding back 1,000 pounds of extracted honey, he had received 800 pounds\r\nof comb honey. Had tiered up the cases of sections until they were three\r\nor four cases high. Had fed the honey as fast as they would take it.\r\nLooked the sections over about once a week, and removed the full ones.\r\nSome colonies did much better work than others. After the first trial,\r\nselected the best. No honey was coming in at the time of the feeding;\r\ndid not weigh the hives; weighed only the sections and the amount. He\r\nhad a friend who had fed back upon exactly the same plan, but his friend\r\nhad not found it profitable. He thought that to know just how to feed\r\nback, at a profit, was not yet positively known.\r\n\r\nD. A. Jones: The question of feeding back has but few advocates, for the\r\nreason that the majority have failed to make it profitable. To be\r\nsuccessful in feeding back there must be no place in the hive in which\r\nthe bees can store honey, except in the sections. Those hives must be\r\nselected that contain the most honey, or else those having but few\r\ncombs. My plan of feeding is to elevate the hives in front and pour the\r\nfeed in upon the bottom-board. The bees do not carry the honey out of\r\nthe hives; they must store it somewhere. Bee-keepers fail to make it\r\npay, because the bees had an empty brood-chamber. Section boxes filled\r\nwith foundation had been given a colony at 9 A. M.; feeding commenced,\r\nand the next day, at evening, the bees had commenced capping some of the\r\nsections. Fifty-two pounds of honey was fed, and forty-four pounds of\r\ncomb honey obtained. To get unfinished sections filled, and at the same\r\ntime have the honey removed from some other unfinished sections, I put\r\nthe sections that I wish emptied, over the hive, and the ones that I\r\nwish finished, in the main body of the hive, keeping the queen out of\r\nthem by using perforated zinc.\r\n\r\nW. Z. Hutchinson: Will not pouring in honey at the entrances excite\r\nrobbing?\r\n\r\nD. A. Jones: I do not pour it in at the entrance. I pour it down inside\r\nthe hive at the back.\r\n\r\nW. Z. Hutchinson: You speak of using perforated zinc. I should like to\r\nknow something about that. Do the bees work through it freely? Is there\r\nany objection to its use, except its cost? And where is the expense? Is\r\nit in the material, or in the preparations?\r\n\r\nD. A. Jones: It is in no way detrimental. The bees work through it\r\nfreely. I see no objection to its use except its cost, and its cost is\r\nthe preparations. Tin would be no cheaper, for the reason that it comes\r\nin smaller sheets, and the waste would be greater.\r\n\r\nW. Z. Hutchinson: I have used honey boards the past season made of\r\nwood, the slats of which were 5-32 of an inch apart, and they answered\r\nevery purpose; and are cheaper than zinc.\r\n\r\nS. T. Pettitt: I can hardly think the wooden boards would be better than\r\nthe zinc. It would take some time to make them, while the zinc is all\r\nready, and so lasting.\r\n\r\nW. Z. Hutchinson: The wood boards cost only a third as much as the zinc\r\nand I prefer them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEE PASTURAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the late Nebraska Bee-keepers’ Convention Mr. Ballard spoke very\r\nhighly of dandelion and alsike clover, stating that he had seen four or\r\nfive bees on one blossom of dandelion, and recommends alsike clover, as\r\nit will take root on the prairie.\r\n\r\nG. M. Cooper, Beatrice, gave it as his opinion that white clover did not\r\nsecrete any honey last spring, on account of the cool weather.\r\n\r\nP. M. Aldrich said that his bees worked on rape long after frost. No one\r\npresent had ever seen rape fail.\r\n\r\nMr. Colwell sowed the roadside twice last year, and had a continuous\r\nbloom all summer, and late in the fall; puts one peck to the acre on the\r\nroadside.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawley sows about six pounds of rape seed per acre.\r\n\r\nMr. Colwell’s bees have a great feast on box elder sap, early in spring.\r\n\r\nMr. Hawley has sown rape several times, but the bees only gathered fast\r\nenough to build up; he can tell when his bees are gathering rape honey,\r\nby the odor.\r\n\r\nC. C. Turney, Ceresco, had seen bees work very extensively on the\r\nblackberry, both blossom and fruit, and also on parsley.\r\n\r\nWm. Sutton, Elk Creek, saw his bees on raspberry and alsike clover; they\r\ndid a great deal to stimulate his bees, although the quantity is limited\r\nin his locality; they bloom about the middle of June.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians of the Nile had floating bee-houses, designed to\r\ntake advantage of the honey harvest. They were warned when it was time\r\nto return home by the depth to which the boat sank in the water under\r\nthe weight of the cargo of honey. That the bees might not be lost, they\r\nwere obliged to journey during the night-time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTANDARD BOOKS.\r\n\r\nPRICE, ONLY FIVE DOLLARS.\r\n\r\nAmerican Roadsters\r\n\r\n—AND—\r\n\r\nTROTTING HORSES,\r\n\r\nBEING A SKETCH OF THE\r\n\r\nTrotting Stallions of the United States.\r\n\r\nAND A\r\n\r\nTreatise on the Breeding of the Same,\r\n\r\n_WITH AN APPENDIX_\r\n\r\nShowing the Pedigrees and Breeding, so far as known of all Trotters that\r\nhave a Record in 2:25 or better, and containing much Practical Matter\r\nrelating to the Breaking Management, and Treatment of Trotting and\r\nBreeding Stock.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATED WITH PORTRAITS OF\r\n\r\nHambletonian, Bellfounder, Administrator, Almont, Edward Everett,\r\nFlorida, Thorndale, Byron, Voltaire, Lakeland Abdallah, Governor\r\nSprague, Cuyler, Gimcrack, Vermont Blackhawk, Mambrino Patchen, and\r\nother great Stallions.\r\n\r\nBY H.

Now a highly colored sunset is not, in itself, a remarkable\r\nphenomenon, and it may occur at any time of the year, and owe its origin\r\nto any one of several causes, very simple in themselves, as refraction\r\nby the atmosphere of the sun’s rays, which are thrown upon the sky after\r\nthe orb itself has passed from sight, or a peculiarly humid condition of\r\nthe upper air, or a remarkable electric condition, such as sometimes\r\nprecedes a thunder storm. But the late brilliant sunsets do not belong\r\nto the category of ordinary phenomena. In the first place, they have not\r\nshown gorgeously hued clouds, as in usual sunset displays, but skies of\r\ndazzling tints and colors. In the second place, they have been prolonged\r\nfor weeks, and have been seen, at intervals, over nearly every part of\r\nthe globe. Evidently, some unusual circumstance must have given rise to\r\nthese unwonted phenomena, and scientists in both hemispheres have been\r\ninterested in seeking an answer to the problem. As it seemed very plain\r\nthat no condition of humidity could account for such remarkable\r\nrefraction, it was universally concluded that some substance, as dust,\r\nmust exist in the upper air regions. This being accepted as probable\r\nanother theory was needed to account for the presence of this dust. The\r\nfirst theory put forward by scientists in this country suggested the\r\nhypothesis of meteoric dust.\r\n\r\nMeteors are gaseous bodies, which move through space in immense numbers,\r\nand in definite orbits. Drawn astray from these orbits by the attraction\r\nof the earth, they are set on fire on contact with the atmosphere, this\r\nignition producing the phenomena of shooting stars. The product of this\r\ncombustion is sometimes heavy enough as to fall rapidly, in the shape of\r\nstones, to the earth. More often it is an impalpable substance, which\r\nfilters slowly down through the air, and is found in the shape of\r\nmetallic dust, on the summits of snow-covered mountains and in the\r\nArctic regions. About the middle of November the earth passes through a\r\nmeteor zone—that is, an immense swarm of meteors revolving around the\r\nsun—and during this month there are always vastly more shooting stars\r\nto be seen than in any other month of the year. The brilliant sunsets\r\nbeing first seen in the latter part of November, their near coincidence\r\nin time with an unusual display of brilliant meteors, seemed to\r\nsubstantiate the theory that they were of similar origin. It is known\r\nthat the telescope reveals immense numbers of these meteors too small to\r\nbe seen by the naked eye, and it seems very probable that millions more\r\nare too small to be seen even with the telescope, mere meteoric dust\r\nthat can only announce its presence to the eye by its refraction of the\r\nsun’s rays as they pass through it. When this dust falls it becomes\r\nvisible otherwise, perhaps. We have spoken of its appearance on\r\nsnow-covered hills. Sometimes it appears as a haze or dry fog. At least\r\nthe appearance of any very remarkable haze, like that which obscured the\r\nlight of the sun for weeks over Europe, in 1783, is now ascribed by\r\nscience to the dust of enormous falls of meteors.\r\n\r\nHad this theory of the cause of the bright sunsets been the true one,\r\nhowever, there should have been unusual displays of shooting stars\r\nvisible as soon as darkness came on after the sunsets, for meteors are\r\nalways ignited by the friction of the earth’s atmosphere. As these were\r\nnot seen, the meteoric dust theory did not gain a very general support,\r\nand the opinion of many scientific men was that we must wait for a more\r\nprobable theory. When it came to be known that these remarkable\r\nappearances of color in the sky had been visible from different points\r\nof the earth’s surface ever since last September, a theory was offered\r\nby Prof. Lockyer, the well-known English astronomer, and the editor of\r\nNature, a leading scientific periodical, which is now generally accepted\r\nas solving the problem.\r\n\r\nMr. Lockyer thinks that these remarkable sunset glows are the late, but\r\ndirect effects of the great volcanic eruptions which occurred in Java,\r\nlast August. He believes that the enormous volumes of fine volcanic dust\r\nthrown out by these eruptions were carried into the upper air, and being\r\nborne by prevailing winds around and above the earth, the reflection of\r\nthe sun’s rays upon them have produced the phenomena witnessed at so\r\nmany different points.\r\n\r\nThe adequacy of this supposed cause seems plain, when we remember what a\r\nmighty convulsion of nature occurred at Java. Earthquake and eruptions\r\nfollowed one another with such force that they were felt for hundreds of\r\nmiles distant. Large islands sunk from sight and new land appeared and\r\nthe entire conformation of the Archipelago in that locality was changed.\r\nThe great volumes of mud thrown out of the volcano Krakatoa fell in\r\nshowers for over three hours in localities more than thirty miles away.\r\nWith volcanic forces at work on this mighty scale, millions of tons of\r\nearth must have been hurled into the upper air. Of this the coarse and\r\nheavy material would naturally fall at once, but vast clouds of\r\nimpalpable dust would be borne upward by the heated air, until they\r\nreached the region of the upper trade-winds, by which they would be\r\nborne westward in the circuit of the globe. Each evening these immense\r\ndust clouds would give a novel brilliancy to the skies, by reflecting\r\nthe light of the setting sun, and during the day an unusual hazy\r\nappearance of the sky would probably be perceived.\r\n\r\nThis hypothesis of Mr. Lockyer was remarkably borne out by facts that\r\nactually occurred. The Java eruptions occurred August 26 and 27. On\r\nAugust 28, from the islands in the Indian Sea, near the African coast,\r\nMauritias, Rodriguez, and the Seychelles, very singular sunsets and\r\nsunrises were observed, though not directly resembling those seen later,\r\nand a strange haze appeared, through which the sun seemed to be white\r\nand dim as the moon. On August 31, in the same latitude as these\r\nislands, in North Brazil, remarkable sunlight effects were observed, the\r\nsun appearing of a deep blue tint; the next evening similar appearances\r\nwere seen in Venezuela. On September 1, also, a remarkable sunset was\r\nreported visible from the Gulf Coast, and one from Trinidad, Spain, at\r\nthe same date. September 5, another was seen near Honolulu, in the\r\nPacific ocean. This line of strange sunsets ran directly east and west.\r\nAnother line ran from southeast to northwest, beginning with Ceylon and\r\nMadras and ending with England. Following this, the phenomena seemed to\r\nspread themselves over the whole portion of the earth’s surface,\r\nappearing at various points during four whole months. The points of\r\ndifference between the earlier and later appearances were closely\r\ndefined by Mr. Lockyer. At first the coarse particles suspended in the\r\nair obscured the sun’s light entirely, as was the case in the\r\nneighborhood of Java immediately following the earthquake. These\r\ndisappearing, the sun seemed white and dim; the dust being still more\r\nthinned out, the blue and red molecules caused the appearance of a blue\r\nsun, and at last there was just enough of the finest dust left suspended\r\nto be carried by the various wind currents hither and thither and\r\nproduce at the time of the setting of the sun, those singular reflected\r\nlights, which, at first almost unnoticed, became, when observed, the\r\nwonder of the world.\r\n\r\nIt may be admitted that there are gaps in the evidence supporting this\r\nlast hypothesis, but it has the merit of probability, and must be\r\naccepted as the best theory of the brilliant sunsets yet offered.\r\n\r\n    A.

S.\r\n\r\nAuthor of “_Walks and Talks on the Farm_,” “_Farm Crops_,” “_Harris on\r\nthe Pig_,” _etc._\r\n\r\nWhile we have no lack of treatises upon artificial fertilizers, there is\r\nno work in which the main stay of the farm—the manure made upon the\r\nfarm is treated so satisfactorily or thoroughly as in this volume.\r\nStarting with the question,\r\n\r\n“WHAT IS MANURE?”\r\n\r\nthe author, well known on both sides of the water by his writings, runs\r\nthrough in sufficient detail every source of manure on the farm,\r\ndiscussing the methods of making rich manure; the proper keeping and\r\napplying it, and especially the\r\n\r\nUSES OF MANURE,\r\n\r\nand the effects of different artificial fertilizers, as compared with\r\nfarm-yard manure, upon different crops. In this he makes free use of the\r\nstriking series of experiments instituted years ago, and still\r\ncontinued, by Lawes and Gilbert, of Rothamsted, England. The\r\n\r\nREMARKABLE TABLES\r\n\r\nin which the results of these experiments are given, are here for the\r\nfirst time made accessible to the American farmer. In fact, there is\r\nscarcely any point relating to fertilizing the soil, including suitable\r\nmanures for special crops, that is not treated, and while the teachings\r\nare founded upon the most elaborate scientific researches, they are so\r\nfar divested of the technical language of science as to commend\r\nthemselves to farmers as eminently “practical.” It is not often that the\r\nresults of scientific investigations are presented in a manner so\r\nthoroughly popular. 12mo.

The\r\nsolution is found in Piazzi Smyth’s metaphor of the Great Pyramid. A\r\ncircumscribed routine of pleasure on one hand, of toil on the other,\r\nequally engrosses the time and thoughts of the dwellers at either end.\r\nIt is only in the middle of the pyramid that one is free to live up to\r\nthe standard of the hideless coffer, the sarcophagus measure, the\r\nmeasure of a man!\r\n\r\nOf the feminine attainers to this measure, says a writer in the American\r\nQueen, the women who are taking up their lives and living them fully in\r\nall their length and breadth and dignity, as lives must be lived to\r\nreach the cosmic standard of the pyramidal man, there is found one\r\npre-eminent type in that woman of letters against whom a hard battle is\r\nbeing waged to-day.\r\n\r\nTo woman emancipated, freed from veil and harem, elevated from her\r\nprimal position when she was but the toy and tool of man’s passion, this\r\nage of civilization points with a pride whose justifiableness has yet to\r\nbe proved. Exterior liberty she has gained indeed; but in the face of\r\nthe fact that this universal crusade against women of letters is but the\r\ndetermination to hold the old shackles on heart and brain, what is her\r\nalleged emancipation but a lengthening of the chain which still binds\r\nher in moral and mental bondage.\r\n\r\n“The shrieking sisterhood,” be it said in justice to the sex, represent\r\na small minority. Few and far between are the women who would usurp\r\nman’s place on platform or at poll; still fewer and farther apart the\r\nadvocate of woman’s right to drop her petticoat for the untrammeled\r\nfreedom of the trousers. But the great-hearted woman, yearning for\r\nrecognition as paramount forces of social regeneration—the great-minded\r\nwomen taking up the problems of life and grappling with them for the\r\nsake of their weaker sisters—these are many, confined and silenced\r\nwithin the gilded bars which society is daily drawing closer and\r\nstronger about them. This narrowing of woman’s sphere, this withholding\r\nher from anything but a mission purely physical, is but a different form\r\nof the old barbarism whose alleged destruction is the boast of the\r\npresent day; and the time is not far distant when the wrong must be\r\nacknowledged and amended, or retrogression brand the age for which we so\r\nproudly claim progression! Let the hackneyed cry of woman’s intellectual\r\ninferiority prove its truth, conclusively, as it has not yet been\r\nproved, or let it be silenced forever! The cranial differences existent\r\nbetween the sexes, upon which the theoristic foundation of their\r\nrespective superiority and inferiority of intellect has been laid, are,\r\nin truth, the exponents of sexual intellectual equality, science having\r\nproclaimed them the visible proofs of that mutual dependence and\r\nadaptability which, sexually, mind has for mind, as body for body. Let\r\nthis truth be no longer denied; let present social theories hold their\r\nsway, and in a generation of pigmies, moral, mental, and physical, our\r\nrace, in all its glorious potentialities, must sink ignominiously into\r\noblivion. This is an important fact, of which society seems to have lost\r\nsight—that upon the women of to-day and of to-morrow the coming man is\r\nwholly dependent, type being the transmitter of type, according to its\r\nkind. The increase of female education has naturally awakened women to a\r\nrecognition of all her latent intellectual possibilities, and hence the\r\ngrowth of feminine ranks in that wide field whose battles are fought\r\nwith a weapon “mightier than the sword.” The recruits of to-day are not\r\nall Mrs. Brownings nor George Eliots, but the world will lose infinitely\r\nin good and strength and sweetness if the budding Adelaide Proctors and\r\nMrs. Burnetts are blighted by the propagation of that harsh masculine\r\ndoctrine which, stripped of its pretty sophisms, is resolved into the\r\nbare assertion that a woman of talent is a woman unsexed! This doctrine,\r\nfalse, shallow, and unjust, is the enemy with whom woman is battling\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nMay the pyramidal prophecy soon be verified when “all things shall be\r\ncompared in pure truth and righteousness.” Then the conflict shall be\r\nended and the intellectual growth of woman be revealed, the heightener,\r\nenricher, purifier of that emotional development which is the essence of\r\nideal womanhood—an essence thrilling as deeply and tenderly the hearts\r\nof the humble followers in her footsteps as it thrilled the hearts of\r\nthat greatest of woman poets, who sang:\r\n\r\n    What art can a woman be good at? Oh, vain!\r\n    What art is she good at but hurting her breast\r\n    With the milk-teeth of babes and a smile at her pain?\r\n\r\npointing in the zenith of her fame to the divine right of maternity as\r\nthe supreme, holiest and sweetest potentiality of womanhood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIVE THE BABIES WATER.\r\n\r\n\r\nA recent editorial article in the New York Medical Record contains the\r\nfollowing pertinent remarks on the value of water in the treatment of\r\nsick infants:\r\n\r\n“With the exception of tuberculosis, no disease is so fatal in infancy\r\nas intestinal catarrh occurring especially during the hot summer months,\r\nand caused, in the majority of cases, by improper diet. There are many\r\nupon whom the idea does not seem to have impressed itself, that an\r\ninfant can be thirsty without, at the same time, being hungry. When\r\nmilk, the chief food of infants, is given in excess, acid fermentation\r\nresults, causing vomiting, diarrhœa, with passage of green or\r\nyellowish-green stools, elevated temperature, and the subsequent train\r\nof symptoms which are too familiar to need repetition. The same thing\r\nwould occur in the adult, if drenched with milk. The infant needs no\r\nfood, but drink. The recommendation of some writers, that barley-water\r\nor gum-water be given to the little patients in these cases, is\r\nsufficient explanation of their want of success in treating this\r\naffection. Pure water is perfectly innocuous to infants, and it is\r\ndifficult to conceive how the seeming prejudice to it ever arose. Any\r\none who has ever noticed the avidity with which a fretful sick infant\r\ndrinks water, and marks the early abatement of febrile and other\r\nsymptoms, will be convinced that water, as a beverage, a quencher of\r\nthirst, a physiological necessity, in fact, should not be denied to the\r\nhelpless member of society. We have often seen an infant which had been\r\ndosed ad nauseam for gastro-intestinal irritability, assume, almost at\r\nonce, a more cheerful appearance, and rapidly grow better, when treated\r\nto the much-needed draught of water. If any prescription is valuable\r\nenough to be used as routine practice, it is, ‘Give the babies water.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK FOR LITTLE FINGERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make a pretty little pitcher, cut off the small end of an egg, then\r\ncarefully remove the yolk and white of the egg; next take a narrow strip\r\nof colored paper and paste it around the edge of the opening, making the\r\npaper pinked in one place so as to look like the mouth of a pitcher.\r\nThen paste a strip around the other end of the egg so that it will stand\r\nalone; to finish the pitcher paste on a strip of paper bent in the shape\r\nof a handle. Cups may be made in the same manner by cutting away more of\r\nthe shell than would be cut in making a pitcher. Pretty air castles are\r\nmade by cutting egg shells in half, building the cut edges with colored\r\npaper or cloth, and fastening to them bright colored cord or silk by\r\nwhich to suspend them. These air castles look pretty when suspended from\r\nbrackets, hanging lamps, etc. The pitchers, cups and air-castles may be\r\nimproved by being ornamented with small pictures pasted on them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBreakfast Cocoa, as a beverage, is universally conceded superior to all\r\nother drinks for the weary man of business or the more robust laborer.\r\nThe preparations of Walter Baker & Co., have long been the standard of\r\nmerit in this line, and our readers who purchase “_Baker’s Breakfast\r\nCocoa_” will find it a most healthful, delicious and invigorating\r\nbeverage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA man passes for what he is worth.

It is just what I should imagine a real old English city\r\nto be—very odd and antiquated, and yet picturesquely beautiful, and\r\naltogether a most charming place in which to spend a summer.\r\n\r\nNever shall I forget the stroll I took alone the second morning after my\r\narrival. The day was one of those rarely perfect ones in July. All\r\nnature seemed wrapped in a dreamy repose; the heat of the sun was\r\ntempered by the soft sea breezes blowing from the grand old ocean not\r\nmany leagues away, whose roar sounded like the voice of many waters,\r\nsoothing, restful, and sweet.\r\n\r\nIt happened that my wanderings led me in to some of the older portions\r\nof the city where the houses are many of them two hundred years old. And\r\nsuch funny, queer old houses. They seemed, somehow, to have a slanting\r\nlook to them; it may have been, however, that it was because the streets\r\nwere so hilly, and such a contrast to our flat, level prairies.\r\n\r\nRight in the midst of the city, among the stores (shops they call them)\r\nand houses one comes suddenly upon the graveyards—some of them not now\r\nin use, but still left there. What interested me was the flat\r\ntombstones. When a little girl my father used to tell me of how the\r\nchildren would take their dolls to the cemetery and play upon and under\r\nthe grave stones. Do I hear you exclaim, “What, play _under_ a grave\r\nstone!” I do not wonder, for it seemed a funny thing to me, but it was\r\nquite clear when I saw how the marble slabs were placed. Instead of\r\nstanding in an upright position, as you have always seen them, they were\r\nlaid flat and raised some distance from the ground (high enough for a\r\nchild to crawl under comfortably) by means of little marble posts. I\r\nused often to roam through these cemeteries with a dear old gentleman\r\nwho would tell me stories of the brave young sailor boys buried there,\r\nfar away from their own loved English homes.\r\n\r\nHalifax is one of the most strongly fortified cities in America, and at\r\nevery turn one meets the red coated soldiers in the streets—when they\r\nare not on duty. What would interest our boys would be to see a sham\r\nbattle; the officers and soldiers all in uniform, eager and active as\r\nfor a real encounter with the enemy.\r\n\r\nOne day I went to visit the strongest fort the city contains. It is\r\ncalled Citadel Hill, and overlooks and commands the harbor; which by\r\nthe way, is considered one of the finest in the world. This Citadel is\r\nmerely an immense hill, covering nearly half a mile of ground and\r\nsituated in the very heart of the city. When you have climbed to the top\r\nyou come upon a large opening, and looking down see a long flight of\r\niron steps leading to the ground, many, many feet below. The hill is\r\nexcavated and stored with arms and ammunition of all kinds, and great\r\ncannons, that look so cruel. All along the outer edge of this excavation\r\nwere little rooms in which the married soldiers lived with their\r\nfamilies. I pitied the little children that had to live in this way,\r\nwithout any home feeling—never knowing at what moment their father\r\nmight be called away, for a soldier’s life is necessarily a roving one.\r\n\r\nThis hill would make a grand coasting place in the winter, and one which\r\nI have no doubt the little Blue Nose boys and girls often avail\r\nthemselves of. In Halifax not only the boys and girls, but the men and\r\nwomen also, make much more of winter sports than we do. The large and\r\nelegant skating rink I hear has just been opened and, the regimental\r\nband have given a grand concert in honor of the occasion.\r\n\r\nSnow-shoeing used to be indulged in largely, but in the city the custom\r\nis, I believe, somewhat falling off. I do not think you Western boys and\r\ngirls could hardly imagine what odd, pretty suits the girls make to go\r\nskating and snow-shoeing in. The one I saw was made of two large white\r\nflannel bed-blankets, with a bright scarlet and blue border. The suit\r\nconsisted of a skirt, circular-like cloak, and cap with a long side flap\r\nto it, which hung nearly to the shoulder. My cousin dressed herself all\r\nup in her pretty rig and then got down her wooden snow-shoes and buckled\r\nthem on. She looked like a winter fairy all ready for an Arctic\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nI must confess I could hardly understand how she could manage to walk in\r\nthe great unwieldy looking shoes, which were nearly five times as large\r\nas an ordinary shoe, but she assured me it was great fun and easily\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nI heard an amusing story there about a minister who wished to be\r\nmarried, but who lived a long distance from the neighboring minister,\r\nand the snow was very deep, and there was but one pair of snow-shoes.\r\nNot wishing to wait until spring he hit upon a novel plan which was\r\nthis:\r\n\r\nThat his ladylove should stand upon the back of his snow-shoes, clasp\r\nher arms tightly around her future lord’s waist, and thus be carried\r\nsafely to the neighboring kirk, which she accordingly did. You see this\r\nrequired no real effort on the lady’s part, only, I should judge, a\r\ngreat deal of pluck and nerve power, as well as love. However the story\r\nis that they accomplished the journey in safety and were duly married.\r\n\r\nOne of the prettiest drives in Halifax can be had in a place called the\r\npark (what we would call a park proper they call the gardens). This\r\npark, situated in the southern part of the city and overlooking an arm\r\nof the ocean, has twenty miles of smooth, beautiful roads winding\r\naround, and circling in and out among the trees. The roads were made by\r\nthe soldiers, who received for their work twenty-five cents a day\r\nbesides their regular army pay. There is also another strong fort in\r\nthis park. There are, I think, nine forts, strongly garrisoned in and\r\nabout the city.\r\n\r\nI wonder if any of THE PRAIRIE FARMER boys and girls have the same\r\ndesire that I had when living away out West, where I never saw water,\r\nmuch less a ship, to go through a large ocean steamship. If you have I\r\nhope that some day you may be able to have your wish gratified as I had\r\nmine.\r\n\r\nOne morning my friend said, “Will you go to a concert this afternoon or\r\ngo and visit the ships?” “The ships of course,” I cried, and to the\r\nships we went. The “Scotia” was just in on her way from Liverpool to New\r\nYork, crowded with passengers. It was noon when we went on board, and\r\nthe long tables were being laid out in the salon. Most of the cabin\r\npassengers were out “doing” the city so we saw only the steerage\r\npassengers. Now I had heard much of the steerage passengers, but really\r\nnever imagined them to be such a poor, miserable looking set of beings.\r\nThey sat around almost anywhere with a plate of soup or a dish full of\r\nother unpalatable appearing food and ate as though they did not care\r\nmuch whether they lived or died. I longed to speak to the children and\r\nthe downcast looking mothers, but they were nearly all of foreign birth,\r\nand would not have understood me if I had.\r\n\r\nMany of the better class of passengers were in the little side rooms at\r\ntheir private meals, but we only caught side glimpses of them passing\r\nthrough. It was a very pleasant sensation to sit in the handsome saloon\r\nand almost imagine yourself to be sailing, sailing away in the great\r\nnoble ship to the land of your dreams and fancies.\r\n\r\nThere are many more things of interest about this pretty city I would\r\nlike to touch upon, but I fear my space is already occupied, so will\r\nhave to say good-by for this week.\r\n\r\n    MARY HOWE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE LEGISLATURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost of these are in session again over the land. I do not mean those\r\nlaw-making bodies which meet annually at the State capitols to undo what\r\nthey had done before, or otherwise make work for the courts and lawyers.\r\nBut I allude to those little assemblies of young folks—lads and\r\nlasses—that weekly meet in the winter season in all the thousand and\r\none school-houses and rural halls throughout our country. Legislatures\r\ndid I call them? Not quite legislatures; but training schools in which\r\nlegislators are made; and it is in these that our rising youth are\r\nqualifying themselves to govern the country that is so soon to be\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nLittle as we may think of it, these assemblies, under whatever name they\r\nmay be known—lyceums, societies, clubs, or “legislatures,”—are a power\r\nin the land; they do far more than most people think in forming the\r\ncharacters and fixing the opinions of the great multitude of boys and\r\ngirls who participate in them. They are to-day more numerous than ever\r\nbefore, though they have been abroad in the land for more than half a\r\ncentury. Many of the leading actors on the world’s stage at the present\r\nday owe their position to the influence of one or more of these little\r\nassociations of which they formed a part in their boyhood days. The\r\nwriter of this could not count on his fingers the number of his\r\nassociates in boyhood, who have risen out of these schools to positions\r\nof honor and trust in the country.\r\n\r\nBut there is a marked feature belonging to them now that did not exist a\r\nhalf century ago, the result of a vast change that has been made in\r\npublic sentiment within that period. Then they were confined only to the\r\nboys; now the girls participate in them almost, if not quite, as freely\r\nas their brothers; and it must be confessed that in a great majority of\r\ncases the result has been beneficial to both sexes. The fogyism of that\r\nday stoutly protested that hens should not be permitted to crow, yet\r\nthey persisted in learning the art, and conservatism has been forced to\r\nacknowledge that they can crow vociferously and to good effect. And\r\nthese institutions have proven to be good crowing schools to girls.\r\n\r\nLet these associations be encouraged in every school district; but care\r\nshould be taken by the elder class that they be properly organized and\r\nconducted in an orderly manner. Youthful zeal and ardor will be apt to\r\nbreak out into rudeness and disorder, unless held in check by the aged\r\nand experienced. Let the older, then, wherever these associations exist,\r\nsee to it that they are prudently managed—else instead of blessings\r\nthey will become evils in the community.\r\n\r\nThe points to which these efforts should be mainly directed, should\r\nbe—first, plain rules for their government; second, a strict adherence\r\nto them when adopted; a diversity of exercises—not too much debate, and\r\nnot too many essays; fourth, the avoidance of all personal matters; and\r\nfifth, a judicious selection of subjects. With these points held well in\r\nview, and with a serious desire for improvement, these institutions can\r\nnot but be useful; otherwise they should be discontinued.\r\n\r\nFarmers everywhere ought to encourage the formation of these\r\ninstitutions in their respective neighborhoods, and aid their sons and\r\ndaughters in carrying them forward. Give them your countenance and your\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\n    T. G.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALKING CANES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe material of which walking sticks are made is as various as can\r\nwell-nigh be conceived of. Many are imported woods—some from the\r\ntropics, China and the East Indies. The celebrated Whongee canes are\r\nfrom China, where they are well known and celebrated for the regularity\r\nof their joints, which are the points from which the leaves are given\r\noff, and the stems of a species of phyllosiachys, a gigantic grass,\r\nclosely allied to the bamboo. The orange and lemon are highly prized,\r\nand are imported chiefly from the West Indies, and perfect specimens\r\ncommand enormous prices. The orange stick is known by its beautiful\r\ngreen bark, with fine white longitudinal markings, and the lemon by the\r\nsymmetry of its proportions, and both prominence and regularity of its\r\nknobs. Myrtle sticks also possess a value, since their appearance is so\r\npeculiar that their owner would seldom fail to recognize them. They are\r\nimported from Algeria. The rajah stick is an importation. It is the stem\r\nof a plant and a species of calamus. It is grown in Borneo, and takes\r\nits name from the fact that the Rajah will not allow any to go out of\r\nthe country unless a heavy duty is paid. These canes, known as palm\r\ncanes, are distinguished by an angular and more or less flat appearance.\r\nTheir color is brownish, spotted, and they are quite straight, with\r\nneither knob nor curl. They are the petioles of leaf stalk of the date\r\npalm. Perhaps the most celebrated of the foreign canes are the Malacca,\r\nbeing the stems of the calamus sceptonum, a slender climbing palm, and\r\nnot growing around Malacca, as the name would seem to indicate, but\r\nimported from Stak, on the opposite coast of Sumatra. Other foreign\r\ncanes are ebony, rosewood, partridge or hairwood, and cactus, which,\r\nwhen the pith is cut out, presents a most novel appearance, hollow and\r\nfull of holes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShortly after Miss Alcott’s “Little Women” was published a quiet-looking\r\nlady entered a Boston circulating library and asked a lady clerk to pick\r\nher out “a good book that would rest and amuse her.” Naturally “Little\r\nWomen” was offered, and declined. “It’s very nice; you’d like it,” urged\r\nthe clerk. “I should not care to read it,” said the other. “But at least\r\nlook at it.” “No,” came the answer, firmly and with an odd smile; “it is\r\nnot a book that I should care to read.” Then the clerk, pretty angry,\r\nwalked away to the chief librarian and cried: “There’s a woman down\r\nthere wants a book, and if you want her waited on somebody else must do\r\nit. I won’t.” “Why, why not?” “Why, she says ‘Little Women’ isn’t good\r\nenough for her to read.” “Do you know who that lady is?” “No, and I\r\ndon’t care.” “Well, I’ll tell you. That is Louise M. Alcott. Now go and\r\nget her a book.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Michigan girl told her young man that she would never marry him until\r\nhe was worth $100,000.

The old bell-ringer came\r\nfrom under the wattled roof of his cottage stoop and stood with\r\nuncovered head in the clear sweet-scented air. He had grown blind and\r\ndeaf in the service, but his arm was as muscular as ever, and he who\r\nlistened this day marked no faltering in the heavy metallic throbs of\r\nthe cathedral bell. Old Jasper had lived through many changes. He had\r\ntolled out the notes of mourning for good Queen Bess, and with tears\r\nscarcely dry he had rung the glad tidings of the coronation of James.\r\nCharles I. had been crowned, reigned, and expiated his weakness before\r\nall England in Jasper’s time, and now he who under army held all the\r\ncommon wealth in the hollow of his hand, ruled as more than monarch, and\r\nstill the old man with the habit of a long life upon him rang his matin\r\nand sorrow.\r\n\r\nJasper stood alone now, lifting his dimmed eyes up to the softly dappled\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nThe wall of his memory seemed so written over—so crossed and recrossed\r\nby the annals of the years that had gone before, that there seemed\r\nlittle room for anything in the present. Little recked he that\r\nCromwell’s spearsmen were camped on the moor beyond the village—that\r\nCromwell himself rode with his guardsmen a league away; he only knew\r\nthat the bell had been rung in the tower when William the Conqueror made\r\ncurfew a law, had been spared by Puritan and Roundhead, and that his arm\r\nfor sixty years had never failed him at even-tide.\r\n\r\nHe was moving with a slow step toward the gate, when a woman came\r\nhurriedly in from the street and stood beside him; a lovely woman, but\r\nwith a face so blanched that it seemed carved in the whitest of marble,\r\nwith all its roundness and dimples. Her great, solemn eyes were raised\r\nto the aged face in pitiful appeal, and the lips were forming words that\r\nhe could not understand.\r\n\r\n“Speak up, lass, I am deaf and can not hear your chatter.”\r\n\r\n“For heaven’s sake, Jasper, do not ring the curfew bells to-night.”\r\n\r\n“What! na ring curfew? You must be daft, lassie.”\r\n\r\n“Jasper, for sweet heaven’s sake—for my sake—for one night in all your\r\nlong life forget to ring the bell! Fail this once and my lover shall\r\nlive, whom Cromwell says shall die at curfew toll. Do you hear? my\r\nlover, Richard Temple. See, Jasper, here is my money to make your old\r\nage happy. I sold my jewelry that the Lady Maud gave me, and the gold\r\nshall be yours for one curfew.”\r\n\r\n“Would you bribe me, Lily De Vere? Ye’re a changeling. Ye’re na the\r\nblood of the Plantagenets in ye’re veins as ye’re mother had. What,\r\ncorrupt the bell-ringer under her majesty, good Queen Bess? Not for all\r\nthe gold that Lady Maud could bring me! Babes have been born and strong\r\nmen have died before now at the ringing of my bell. Awa’! Awa’!”\r\n\r\nAnd out on the village green with the solemn shadows of the lichens\r\nlengthening over it, a strong man awaited the curfew toll for his death.\r\nHe stood handsome, and brave, and tall—taller by an inch than the\r\ntallest pikeman who guarded him.\r\n\r\nWhat had he done that he should die? Little it mattered in those days,\r\nwhen the sword that the great Cromwell wielded was so prone to fall,\r\nwhat he or others had done. He had been scribe to the late lord up at\r\nthe castle, and Lady Maud, forgetting that man must woo and woman must\r\nwait, had given her heart to him without the asking, while the gentle\r\nLily De Vere, distant kinswoman and poor companion of her, had, without\r\nseeking, found the treasures of his true love and held them fast. Then\r\nhe had joined the army and made one of the pious soldiers whose evil\r\npassions were never stirred but by sign or symbol of poetry. But a\r\nscorned woman’s hatred had reached him even there. Enemies and deep\r\nplots had compassed him about and conquered him. To-night he was to die.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful world lay as a vivid picture before him. The dark green\r\nwood above the rocky hill where Robin Hood and his merry men had dwelt;\r\nthe frowning castle with its drawbridge and square towers, the long\r\nstretch of moor with the purple shadows upon it, the green, straight\r\nwalks of the village, the birds overhead, even the daisies at his feet\r\nhe saw. But ah! more vividly than all, he saw the great red sun with its\r\nhazy veil lingering above the trees as though it pitied him with more\r\nthan human pity.\r\n\r\nHe was a God fearing and a God serving man. He had long made his peace\r\nwith heaven. Nothing stood between him and death—nothing rose\r\npleadingly between him and those who were to destroy him but the sweet\r\nface of Lily De Vere, whom he loved. She had knelt at Cromwell’s feet\r\nand pleaded for his life. She wearied heaven with her prayers, but all\r\nwithout avail.\r\n\r\nSlowly now the great sun went down. Slowly the last rim was hid beneath\r\nthe greenwood. Thirty seconds more and his soul would be with God. The\r\ncolor did not forsake his cheeks. The dark rings of hair lay upon a warm\r\nbrow. It was his purpose to die as martyrs and brave men die. What was\r\nlife that he should cling to it? He almost felt the air pulsate with the\r\nfirst heavy roll of the death knell. But no sound came. Still facing the\r\nsoldiers with his clear gray eyes upon them he waited.\r\n\r\nThe crimson banners in the west were paling to pink. The kine had ceased\r\ntheir lowing, and had been gathered into the rick yards.\r\n\r\nAll nature had sounded her curfew, but old Jasper was silent!\r\n\r\nThe bell-ringer, with his gray head yet bared, had traversed half the\r\ndistance between his cottage and the ivy-covered tower when a form went\r\nflitting past him, with pale, shadowy robes floating round it, and hair\r\nthat the low western lights touched and tinted as with a halo.\r\n\r\n“Ah, Huldah, Huldah!” the old man muttered; “how swift she flies? I will\r\ncome soon dear. My work is almost done.”\r\n\r\nHuldah was the good wife who had gone from him in her early womanhood,\r\nand for whom he had mourned all his long life. But the fleeting form was\r\nnot Huldah’s. It was Lily De Vere, hurried by a sudden and desperate\r\npurpose toward the cathedral.\r\n\r\n“So help me God, curfew shall not ring to-night! Cromwell and his\r\ndragoons come this way. Once more I will kneel at his feet and plead.”\r\n\r\nShe entered the ruined arch. She wrenched from its fastening the carved\r\nand worm-eaten door that barred the way to the tower. She ascended with\r\nflying and frenzied feet the steps; her heart lifted up to God for\r\nRichard’s deliverance from peril. The bats flew out and shook the dust\r\nof centuries from the black carving. As she went up she caught glimpses\r\nof the interior of the great building, with its groined roof, its\r\nchevrons and clustered columns; its pictured saint and carved image of\r\nthe virgin, which the pillages of ages had been spared to be dealt with\r\nby time, the most relentless vandal of all.\r\n\r\nUp—still—up—beyond the rainbow tints thrown by the stained glass\r\nacross her death-white brow; up—still—up—past open arch, with griffin\r\nand gargoyles staring at her from under bracket and cornice, with all\r\nthe hideousness and mediæval carving; the stairs, flight by flight,\r\ngrowing frailer beneath her young feet; now but a slender network\r\nbetween her and the outer world; but still up.\r\n\r\nHer breath was coming short and gasping. She saw through an open space\r\nold Jasper cross the road at the foot of the tower. Oh, how far! The\r\nseconds were treasures which Cromwell, with all his blood-bought\r\ncommonwealth, could not purchase from her. Up—ah—there, just above her\r\nwith its great brazen mouth and wicked tongue, the bell hung. A worm\r\neaten block for a step, and one small white had clasped itself above the\r\nclapper—the other prepared, at the tremble, to rise and clasp its mate,\r\nand the feet to swing off—and thus she waited. Jasper was old and slow,\r\nbut he was sure and it came at last. A faint quiver, and the young feet\r\nswung from their rest, and the tender hands clasped for more than their\r\nprecious life the writhing thing. There was groaning and creaking of the\r\nrude pulleys above, and then the strokes came heavy and strong. Jasper’s\r\nhand had not forgot its cunning, nor his arm its strength. The tender,\r\nsoft form was swung and dashed to and fro. But she clung to and caressed\r\nthe cold, cruel thing. Let one stroke come and a thousand might\r\nfollow—for its fatal work would be done. She wreathed her white arms\r\nabout it, so that with every pull of the great rope it crushed into the\r\nflesh. It tore her, and wounded and bruised; but there in the solemn\r\ntwilight the brave woman swung and fought with the curfew, and God gave\r\nher victory.\r\n\r\nThe old bell-ringer said to himself: “Aye, Huldah, my work is done. The\r\npulleys are getting too heavy for my old arms; my ears, too, have failed\r\nme. I dinna hear one stroke of the curfew. Dear old bell! it is my ears\r\nthat have gone false, and not thou. Farewell old friend.”\r\n\r\nAnd just beyond the worn pavement a shadowy form again went flitting\r\npast him. There were drops of blood upon the white garments, and the\r\nface was like the face of one who walked in her sleep, and her hands\r\nhung wounded and powerless at her side. Cromwell paused with his\r\nhorsemen under the dismantled May-pole before the village green. He saw\r\nthe man who was to die at sunset standing up in the dusky air, tall as a\r\nking and beautiful as Absalom. He gazed with knitted brow and angry eye,\r\nbut his lips did not give utterance to the quick command that trembled\r\non them, for a girl came flying toward him. Pikeman and archer stepped\r\naside to let her pass. She threw herself upon the turf at his horse’s\r\nfeet; she lifted her bleeding and tortured hands to his gaze, and once\r\nmore poured out her prayer for the life of her lover; with trembling\r\nlips she told him why Richard still lived—why the curfew had not\r\nsounded.\r\n\r\nLady Maud looking out of her latticed window at the castle, saw the\r\ngreat protector dismount, lift the fainting form in his arms and bear\r\nher to her lover. She saw the guards release their prisoner, and she\r\nheard the shouts of joy at his deliverance; then she welcomed the night\r\nthat shut the scene out from her envious eye and sculptured her in its\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nAt the next matin bell old Jasper died, and at curfew toll he was laid\r\nbeside the wife who had died in his youth, but the memory of whom had\r\nbeen with him always.\r\n\r\n    —_Bulletin, Haverhill, Mass._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWork every hour, paid or unpaid, see only that thou work, and thou canst\r\nnot escape thy reward.

Dot’s der kind of a vhife she vhas!”\r\n\r\nThe officer investigated, to find that cats were responsible for the\r\nnoises, and as he retired the householder was calling to his wife:\r\n\r\n“Mary, if you go down I shtand on der stairs mit a light und a shot-gun\r\nund shoot eafery burglar like tunder.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWANTED WEATHER-STRIPS.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Didn’t I leave an order here three days ago for weather-strips?”\r\ndemanded an indignant citizen of the proprietor of a Woodward avenue\r\nstore yesterday.\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, you did.”\r\n\r\n“And didn’t you say you would send a man to put them on?”\r\n\r\n“I did.”\r\n\r\n“And he was sick, I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; he went up there two days ago.”\r\n\r\n“And put on the strips?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Where?”\r\n\r\n“On the front and side doors, of course.”\r\n\r\n“On the doors—of course—who in Halifax ordered them on the doors of\r\nthe house? I wanted them strips for the barn doors!”\r\n\r\n“You did?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I did. Do you suppose I want draughts of air sweeping in on\r\nmy poor horses this kind o’ weather?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIT’S A TELEPHONE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA well-to-do but unsophisticated back-woodsman was in the city lately,\r\nattending the Fat Stock Show, and brought along his wife and daughters\r\nto see the sights and do some shopping. Among other places they visited\r\nwas Mandel’s new store, and after wandering around the first floor for a\r\nwhile the party came to a stop near the elevators.\r\n\r\nOne of the daughters was first to discover the cars moving silently up\r\nand down, receiving and discharging their cargoes of passengers. She\r\njerked her father’s coat sleeve to direct his attention to the\r\nphenomenon, and in a tone that was audible to the clerks in the\r\nneighborhood asked:\r\n\r\n“What’s that, paw—that thing going up and down, with sofys in it?”\r\n\r\nThe old man gave the elevator a long, calm, deliberate, scrutinizing\r\nstare, and exclaimed with joy:\r\n\r\n“By gosh! it’s a telephone! the first I ever saw!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EMERGENCY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days ago a man with a weak and humble expression, and wearing a\r\nsummer suit of clothes, applied to one of the railroad passenger agents\r\nfor a dead-head pass to Toledo.\r\n\r\n“Why when do you want to go to Toledo?”\r\n\r\n“To get married.”\r\n\r\n“And you haven’t any money?”\r\n\r\n“Not above twenty-five cents.”\r\n\r\n“Hadn’t you better be worth your fare to Toledo before taking a wife on\r\nyour hands to support?”\r\n\r\n“You don’t understand the case,” protested the man. “I’m going to marry\r\na widow worth at least $5,000, and the first thing I shall do will be to\r\nremit you the price of a ticket. I’m poor, and the widow knows it, but\r\nshe marries me for love.”\r\n\r\nHe protested so long and earnestly that he was finally passed down the\r\nroad. Two days elapsed, and then a letter was received from him saying:\r\n\r\n“Heaven bless you for your kindness? Reached here all right, and married\r\nthe widow according to programme. It turns out that she isn’t worth a\r\ncopper. In this emergency may I ask you to pass us both to Detroit,\r\nwhere I have hopes of striking a job?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fellow who went into a sink hole clear to his nose remarked that it\r\nwasn’t much, as he had only gotten in up to his sneeze, and he had gum\r\nboots on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“We have struck smoother road, haven’t we?” asked a passenger of a\r\nconductor on an Arkansas railway. “No.” replied the conductor. “We have\r\nonly run off the track.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHas it ever occurred to you that the initials N.

To which he replied: “And you are\r\njust as sweet as you are candid.” Another leap-year horror.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Rebecca,” said Mose Schaumberg, an Austin merchant prince to his wife.\r\n“I vants you to gif me your photograph.” “Und vat in the vorld do you\r\nvant mit mine photograph?” inquired the wife. “I vants to paste it on\r\nmine pipe. Times vas so pad dad I vants to preak mineself of smoking,”\r\nanswered Mose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Your visits remind me of the growth of a successful newspaper,” said\r\nUncle Jabez, leaning his chin on his cane, and glancing at William\r\nArthur, who was sweet on Angelica. “Why so?” inquired William. “Well,\r\nthey commenced as a weekly, grew to be a tri-weekly, and have now become\r\ndaily, with a weekly supplement.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey were returning home from the theatre and had nearly reached her\r\nhome, when the young man observed: “Isn’t the weather cold and raw?” She\r\nmust have misunderstood him. “Raw,” she said, rather hesitatingly. “Yes,\r\nI like them raw, but,” she continued, looking sweetly in his eyes,\r\n“don’t you think they are nicer fried?” What could he do?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne more unfortunate: Mamma (a widow of considerable personal\r\nattractions)—“I want to tell you something, Tommy. You saw that\r\ngentleman talking to grandmamma in the other room. Well, he is going to\r\nbe your new papa. Mamma’s going to marry him.” Tommy (who recollects\r\nsomething of the life his old papa used to lead)—“D-d-does he know it\r\nyet mamma?”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“Doctor,” said our young man to a jocular dentist, “I hear you’ve been\r\nsaying that I’ve got a mouth that always reminds you of the mouth of the\r\nMississippi. Is that so?” “Of course not, my dear boy,” said Burton. “I\r\nnever said anything so cruel. All I said was that when I was reaching\r\nfor one of your rear snags I always felt safer when I had a\r\nlife-preserver around me.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nQueen Victoria took the second prize at the York show with a yearling\r\nheifer from her Balmoral farm, and she kicked like a steer because she\r\ndidn’t get the first. The heifer did, not Victoria. Er himperial majesty\r\nkicked too, because the first prize is one shilling thruppence, while\r\nthe second is only one shilling tuppence happeny, but her protest of\r\ncourse was made in a most majestic and lady-like manner.—_Hawkeye._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSome of the richest men in Austin started in life in a very modest way,\r\nand are still plain, unpretentious people, but their sons put on a great\r\ndeal of style. One of the latter, who was better posted about other\r\npeople’s affairs than his own family’s remarked sneeringly to an\r\nacquaintance: “Your father was nothing but a simple stonemason.” “I know\r\nwhere you got that information,” quietly remarked the other. “From whom\r\ndid I get it?” “From your father.” “How do you know that?” “Because\r\nyour father used to be my father’s hod-carrier.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is a base slander upon the goat to say he eats tomato can labels and\r\ncircus poster and old hoop skirts and things because he likes them. He\r\nis driven to this coarse, and not very nutritious fare, by hard times\r\nand destitution. When he can stand on his hind legs and eat his\r\nluxurious way along a clothes-line, all the circus posters in the world\r\ncan’t lure him away from the night shirt and the par boiled sheet. Be\r\njust to the goat. And how he does love a coil of manilla rope or a\r\nrubber door mat. The fact is, the goat is gifted with a fine rather\r\nepicurean taste, and if we could afford to feed him the things he is\r\nfond of he would never touch a tomato can.—_Hawkeye._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSPECIAL OFFER.\r\n\r\n$67 FOR $18!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA Superb New Family Sewing Machine!\r\n\r\nCombining all the most recent improvements, and now selling for $65, is\r\noffered by THE PRAIRIE FARMER PUBLISHING COMPANY to subscribers to THE\r\nPRAIRIE FARMER\r\n\r\nFOR $18,\r\n\r\nincluding one year’s subscription to the paper.\r\n\r\nThis exceptional offer will remain open for a few days only.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSTANDARD BOOKS\r\n\r\nNOW READY FOR DISTRIBUTION.\r\n\r\nVOLUMES ONE AND TWO\r\nOF THE\r\nNATIONAL REGISTER NORMAN HORSES\r\n\r\nThe most reliable, concise, and exhaustive history of the horse in\r\ngeneral, and by far the most complete and authentic one of the Norman\r\nhorse in particular, ever published in the United States.\r\n\r\nPRICES:\r\n\r\nVolume I.........................................$ 2.00\r\n\r\nVolume II........................................  1.50\r\n\r\nWhen the two volumes are sent in one package to one address, $3.00.\r\nSent, postpaid, on receipt of price.\r\n\r\nAddress your orders to\r\n\r\nPRAIRIE FARMER PUBLISHING CO., Chicago\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nQUINBY’S\r\nNEW BEE-KEEPING,\r\nTHE MYSTERIES OF BEE-KEEPING EXPLAINED\r\n\r\nCombining the results of fifty years’ experience with the latest\r\ndiscoveries and inventions and presenting the most approved methods,\r\nforming\r\n\r\nA COMPLETE GUIDE\r\n—TO—\r\nSUCCESSFUL BEE-CULTURE\r\n\r\nBy L.

D.\r\n\r\nA WORK ON WINTER GARDENING, GIVING THE RESULTS OF ACTUAL PRACTICE.\r\n\r\nThe author for several years past has found recreation in beautifying\r\nhis study with plants; his work has resulted in so much enjoyment to\r\nhimself and his friends that he has been induced to tell what he did and\r\nhow he did it. The book is not a mere dry set of directions, but its\r\nteachings are presented in the pleasant form of letters to some young\r\nladies, who, having witnessed the author’s success, have asked his\r\ninstruction, and this allows a genial personality to pervade the work,\r\nand makes it withal readable as well as instructive. It is a most\r\nexcellent guide to successful winter gardening, as suited to American\r\nhomes, with our peculiar domestic surroundings, and those who follow its\r\nteachings will reach a satisfactory measure of success. The engravings\r\ninclude several representations of the author’s study. Finely\r\nillustrated 12mo.

KIRKMAN’S BOOKS ON RAILROAD TOPICS.\r\n\r\nDO YOU WANT TO BECOME A RAILROAD MAN\r\n\r\nIF YOU DO, THE BOOKS DESCRIBED BELOW POINT THE WAY.\r\n\r\nThe most promising field for men of talent and ambition at the present\r\nday is the railroad service. The pay is large in many instances, while\r\nthe service is continuous and honorable. Most of our railroad men began\r\nlife on the farm. Of this class is the author of the accompanying books\r\ndescriptive of railway operations, who has been connected continuously\r\nwith railroads as a subordinate and officer for 27 years. He was brought\r\nup on a farm, and began railroading as a lad at $7 per month. He has\r\nwritten a number of standard books on various topics connected with the\r\norganization, construction, management and policy of railroads. These\r\nbooks are of interest not only to railroad men but to the general reader\r\nas well. They are indispensable to the student. They present every phase\r\nof railroad life, and are written in an easy and simple style that both\r\ninterests and instructs. The books are as follows:\r\n\r\n“RAILWAY EXPENDITURES—THEIR EXTENT,\r\nOBJECT AND ECONOMY.”—A Practical\r\nTreatise on Construction and Operation.\r\nIn Two Volumes, 850 pages.                         $4.00\r\n\r\n“HAND BOOK OF RAILWAY EXPENDITURES.”—Practical\r\nDirections for Keeping\r\nthe Expenditure Accounts.                           2.00\r\n\r\n“RAILWAY REVENUE AND ITS COLLECTION.”—And\r\nExplaining the Organization of\r\nRailroads.                                          2.50\r\n\r\n“THE BAGGAGE, PARCEL AND MAIL TRAFFIC\r\nOF RAILROADS.”—An interesting work\r\non this important service; 425 pages.               2.00\r\n\r\n“TRAIN AND STATION SERVICE.”—Giving\r\nThe Principal Rules and Regulations governing\r\nTrains; 280 pages.                                  2.00\r\n\r\n“THE TRACK ACCOUNTS OF RAILROADS.”—And\r\nhow they should be kept.

There were four hundred students in the building. No\r\nlives lost.\r\n\r\nThere are now 7,794 ocean steamers belonging to the different nations.\r\nAbout one half the ocean sailing vessels belong to England. Their total\r\nnumber is 36,194.\r\n\r\nThe famous Smithson college building at Logansport, Indiana, which is\r\nsaid to be the handsomest structure of its kind in the State, is to be\r\npurchased and turned into a normal school.\r\n\r\nArticles of incorporation have been filed at New York for the Merchants’\r\nTelegraph and Cable Company; capital stock $13,000,000, with power to\r\nincrease that sum to, but not beyond $20,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of tin at King’s mountain, Cleveland county, N.

It is\r\nsaid that sufficient new evidence to convict him has come to light.\r\n\r\nIt is believed that an agreement has been reached at Pittsburg between\r\nthe striking glass-workers and the employers.

The exports were 1,200,000,000 francs in excess of the\r\nimports, he said, and within five years 6,000,000 francs had been\r\nexpended on buildings for which tenants could hardly be obtained.\r\n\r\nYoung James Nutt was acquitted of the murder of Dukes on the ground of\r\ninsanity. An after examination of his condition resulted in a\r\ndeclaration that he is no longer insane. The case is one of wide\r\ncelebrity. Public opinion justifies the verdict.

The\r\ngrade has been far from first-class, but few of them weighing over\r\n1,400 lbs. The export demand for really choice stock was greater than\r\nthe supply. Common to choice lots sold to shippers at $5@6 70, with some\r\nsales as low as $4 75.\r\n\r\nQuotations closed as follows:\r\n\r\nFancy heavy fat cattle                      Nominal.\r\nChoice to prime steers                    $ 6 70@ 7 15\r\nGood to choice steers                       6 25@ 6 65\r\nFair to good shipping steers                5 65@ 6 20\r\nCommon to medium steers                     4 75@ 5 00\r\nButcher’s steers                            4 65@ 5 10\r\nCows, common to good                        3 25@ 4 70\r\nCommon canning cattle                       2 25@ 3 20\r\nStockers                                    3 80@ 4 50\r\nFeeders                                     4 50@ 5 10\r\nMilch cows, per head                       25 00@55 00\r\nVeal calves, per 100 lbs.                   4 00@ 7 50\r\n\r\nHOGS.—Most of the packing houses are closed, yet there are a few\r\npackers competing with the shippers. Prices are now about 30 cents lower\r\nthan last year at this time. Receipts were about 16,000 head on Sunday\r\nand Monday. The number of hogs left over last night was very small.

The average\r\ngrade was poor. Sales ranged from $3 05 to $6 for common to prime.\r\nCommon lots suffered a decline.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nJ. H.
