F.G.S., the author of \"A Catalogue of British\r\nFossils,\" to append, in almost every instance, the generic and\r\nspecific names adopted by the most recent authorities, the volume\r\nwill, I trust, not only prove interesting to the general reader, as\r\na beautiful _Pictorial Atlas_ of some of the most remarkable relics\r\nof the animals and plants of a \"Former World,\" but also constitute\r\na valuable book of reference in the library of the Geologist and\r\nPalæontologist, since it contains the names and localities of no\r\ninconsiderable number of species and genera.\r\n\r\nFor the guidance of the unscientific reader who may desire further\r\ninformation on any of the subjects treated of in the following pages,\r\nreferences are given to a few general works on Geology and Fossil\r\nRemains.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Chester Square, Pimlico,\r\n      _August 1850._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n

The figures are one-third less in linear dimensions than the\r\noriginals.\r\n\r\nFigures 1^_a_, 2^_a_, 3^_a_, show the palmar, or under surface of\r\nthe respective toes, and exhibit the trochlear or articulating\r\nextremities of the phalangeal bones.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe ancient swamp or morass in which these matchless specimens were\r\nimbedded, is situated on the shore, in a little creek or bay near\r\nIsland Point, at the mouth of the river Waikouaiti, and is covered\r\nby the sea except at the lowest tides. Many remains of the largest\r\nspecies of Moa have from time to time been obtained from this\r\ndeposit; the bones sent to England by Dr. Mackellar, Mr. Percy Earle,\r\nand others, figured and described in the Zoological Transactions by\r\nProfessor Owen, were from this locality.\r\n\r\nThe specimens figured were obtained by Mr. Walter Mantell, in\r\n1849, when visiting Waikouaiti, as Government Commissioner for the\r\nsettlement of Native claims. On the recession of the tide, the\r\nupper (or proximal) ends of the metatarsals were just visible above\r\nthe surface: these were carefully dug up, and all the bones of the\r\nrespective toes numbered, one by one, as they were extracted from\r\nthe soil. In this state they were sent to me, and have subsequently\r\nbeen articulated under my direction, in their natural order of\r\narrangement.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: By the well-known eminent anatomical artist, Mr. Flower,\r\nof 22, Lambeth Terrace, Lambeth Road.]\r\n\r\nThe condition and position of the bones, and the nature of the\r\ndeposit,--evidently an ancient morass, in which the New Zealand flax\r\n(_phormium tenax_) once grew luxuriantly,--remind us of the very\r\nsimilar circumstances in which the extinct gigantic Elks in Ireland,\r\nand the Mastodons in America, have occasionally been found engulfed\r\nin peat bogs and morasses; and, as my son emphatically observes, it\r\nis impossible to arrive at any other conclusion than that the Moa to\r\nwhich these feet belonged, had sunk down in the swamp, and perished\r\non the spot. Vertebræ and other parts of a skeleton of a bird of the\r\nsame proportions, were dug up near the feet.\r\n\r\nAs the specimens under examination are the first examples in\r\nwhich the entire series of the phalangeal and ungueal bones have\r\nbeen found in natural connexion with the metatarsals, I subjoin\r\nthe admeasurements of the several parts, to render the peculiar\r\nconstruction of the feet in one species of the lost race of the\r\ncolossal birds of New Zealand, more obvious to those who may feel\r\ninterested in the subject.\r\n\r\nTARSO-METATARSAL BONES.\r\n\r\n                                                             Inches.

The transverse diameter of the\r\nexpanse of the foot, from the distal extremity of the inner toe (fig.\r\n1^a), to that of the outer one (fig. 3^a), is 15½ inches. The length\r\nfrom the posterior part of the trochlear extremity of the metatarsal\r\nto the distal end of the ungueal of the middle toe (fig. 2^a), is\r\n13 inches. If to the actual dimensions of the bones be added the\r\nproportional thickness of the cartilaginous integuments, nails, &c.,\r\nthe length of the foot of the living bird may be estimated at about\r\n16 inches, and the breadth at 17 or 18 inches.\r\n\r\nFrom the great width and solidity of the metatarsals, and the form\r\nand corresponding size and strength of the phalangeals and ungueals,\r\nthe ornithologist will perceive that the feet of the Moa must have\r\nconstituted powerful instruments for scratching, digging, and\r\nuprooting the sub-terrestrial vegetable substances, which Professor\r\nOwen, with great probability, infers, formed the chief sustenance of\r\nthe extinct colossal birds of New Zealand.\r\n\r\nAccording to the relative proportions of the bones composing the\r\nhinder extremities of the gigantic species of Moa, the corresponding\r\n_tibia_, or leg-bone, of the feet above described, would be two feet\r\nnine inches in length, and the _femur_, or thigh bone, nine and a\r\nhalf inches; the total height of the bird was probably about ten feet.\r\n\r\nTibiæ, femora, and other bones of much larger proportions,\r\n(apparently of _Dinornis giganteus_ and _D. ingens_,) were obtained\r\nfrom the same locality; some of these indicate birds of eleven or\r\ntwelve feet in height; dimensions exceeding by one-third those of the\r\nlargest known existing species of Struthionidæ--the Ostrich.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Even from this imperfect description (and further\r\nanatomical details would be irrelevant in the present work), the\r\nornithologist cannot fail to observe the peculiar characters\r\nexhibited by these extremities of the remarkable family of birds,\r\nof which the diminutive Apteryx appears to be the only living\r\nrepresentative. But the Apteryx differs most essentially in the\r\nstructure of the cranium and mandibles, from the extinct types to\r\nwhich Professor Owen has given the names of Dinornis, Palapteryx,\r\nAptornis, &c.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the construction of the feet it may be further\r\nremarked, that the length of the inner and outer toes is nearly\r\nequal, as in the Cassowary; but the middle toe, which in the\r\nCassowary is one-third longer than the other digits, in the Moa\r\nscarcely exceeds in length by one-fifth, the inner and outer toes.\r\nThe ungueal segments are very large, being equal to one-third the\r\nlength of the toes. The phalangeals are relatively much shorter than\r\nin the Cassowary and Ostrich, and wider than in the former, and more\r\narched than in either of these living struthious birds.\r\n\r\nIn the metatarsal the presence of the three elements whose fusion\r\nconstitutes the bone, is strongly marked; there does not appear\r\nto be any certain indications of a posterior or hind toe, though\r\nProfessor Owen imagines he has detected feeble traces of a fourth\r\ndigit: in that case the bird to which my specimens belonged, would\r\nbe termed _Palapteryx_. The crania found by Mr. Walter Mantell at\r\nWaingongoro, and figured and described by Professor Owen in the\r\nZoological Transactions (Vol. III., Plates 52, 53, 54, 55), as\r\nDinornis and Palapteryx, must have belonged to birds of comparatively\r\nsmall stature. The skull with the adze-like upper mandible, and\r\nthe enormously-developed _basi-occipitals_ and _basi-sphenoids_\r\n(_Dinornis_, of Professor Owen, Plate 53), was found associated with\r\nmany vertebræ of the neck and back, and bones of the leg, of the same\r\nbird; and these my son states indicated a height of from six to seven\r\nfeet. The skull and the rest of the skeleton were found imbedded in\r\nsand, and lying in their natural relative position; unfortunately,\r\nall these precious remains, except the cranium, were destroyed by\r\na sudden rush of the natives to seize upon the exhumed relics! It\r\ntherefore yet remains to discover the cranial type that characterized\r\nthe colossal forms at present known only by other parts of the\r\nskeleton.]\r\n\r\nReferring the reader to the additional account of the fossil birds\r\nof New Zealand given in a subsequent part of this volume (see\r\n_Supplementary Notes_, p. 173), I will conclude this notice with a\r\nfew general remarks. From the numerous facts relating to the fossil\r\nremains of birds from our Antipodean colony, that have now been\r\nbrought under the consideration of the naturalists and geologists of\r\nthis country, we may safely conclude, that at a period geologically\r\nrecent, but of immense antiquity in relation to the human inhabitants\r\nof those Islands, New Zealand was densely peopled by tribes of\r\ncolossal struthious bipeds, of species and genera that have long\r\nsince become extinct. I believe that ages ere the advent of the\r\nMaori tribes, the Moa and its kindred were the chief inhabitants\r\nof the country, and that from the period when those Islands were\r\ntaken possession of by man, the race gradually diminished, and the\r\ncolossal types were finally annihilated by human agency. That some\r\nof the largest species were contemporary with the Maories, there can\r\nnow be no reasonable doubt. Apart from native traditions, and songs\r\nand tales in which allusions are made to the gigantic magnitude and\r\nflowing plumage of the Moa, the collocation of calcined and half\r\nroasted bones of the Dinornis, of dogs, and of the human species,\r\nin the ancient fire-heaps of the aborigines, and the unequivocal\r\nmarks of the celt or axe of jade on some of the tibiæ,--the chips or\r\ncuts having evidently been made on the bones when recent,--afford\r\nincontrovertible proof that the last of the Moas, like the last of\r\nthe Dodos, was annihilated by human agency.\r\n\r\nFrom the remarkable size and strength of the thighs, legs, and feet\r\nof the Moas, it is clear that the hinder limbs must have constituted\r\npowerful locomotive organs; and when we consider the vast swarms of\r\nthe largest species which existed at some remote period, it seems\r\nhighly probable that this family of colossal birds,--a family unknown\r\nin any other part of the world,--was not originally confined within\r\nthe narrow geographical limits of modern New Zealand, but ranged over\r\na vast continent now submerged, and of which Phillip and Norfolk\r\nIslands, and Chatham and Auckland Islands, and those of New Zealand,\r\nare the culminating points.\r\n\r\nBut whatever may be the result of future discoveries as to the\r\nrelative age of the bone-deposits, or the existence or extinction\r\nof any of the colossal species of Moa, or the former extension of\r\nthe race over countries now submerged, one astounding fact must ever\r\nremain unassailable--the vast preponderance of the class Aves or\r\nBirds, that prevailed, and which still prevails, in the fauna of New\r\nZealand, to the almost entire exclusion of mammalia and reptiles. Any\r\npalæontologist who saw only the collections sent over by my son, must\r\nhave been astonished at their extent and variety. I may venture to\r\naffirm that such an assemblage of the fossil bones of birds was never\r\nbefore seen in Europe: nearly fifteen hundred specimens, collected\r\nfrom various parts of the country, with scarcely any intermixture\r\nof the remains of any other class;--it is a phenomenon as startling\r\nas the exclusively reptilian character of the fauna of the Wealden\r\nepoch. But the fauna of New Zealand, even at the present time,\r\npresents a character as ornithic and as anomalous as its ancient one;\r\nfor while there are upwards of fifty or sixty genera of birds, there\r\nis but one indigenous mammalian quadruped known to naturalists--a\r\nspecies of rat! In this respect, therefore, as well as in its flora,\r\nin which ferns and other cellulosæ of peculiar types prevail to an\r\nextent unknown elsewhere, the country offers a striking example of\r\nthat now acknowledged fact in natural history--a centre or focus of\r\ncreation of certain organic types. And this law, with whose operation\r\nduring the palæozoic and secondary ages modern geological researches\r\nhave made us familiar, appears to have continued in unabated energy\r\nto the present moment.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been advanced, it is manifest that the present\r\ngeographical distribution of special groups of terrestrial animals\r\nand plants, displays as many anomalies in the relative predominance\r\nof the different classes and orders over certain areas, without\r\nrelation to climatorial or other obvious physical conditions, as can\r\nbe traced in the natural records of the earlier ages of the world.\r\nThe conclusion therefore forces itself upon the mind, that throughout\r\nthe vast periods of time to which our retrospective knowledge\r\nextends, the geological changes of the earth's surface, and the\r\nappearance and obliteration of species and genera, have been governed\r\nby the same physical and organic laws; and that notwithstanding the\r\nvariable conditions of the land and the water, indicated by the\r\nsedimentary formations, there was at no period a greater discrepancy\r\nin the assemblages of certain types of the animal and vegetable\r\nkingdoms, than exists at present.\r\n\r\nOf the nature of that law by which the extinction of a race of highly\r\norganized beings is determined, and whose effects through innumerable\r\nages palæontology has in part revealed, we are as utterly ignorant\r\nas of that which governs the first appearance of the minutest living\r\nanimalcule which the powers of the microscope enable us to descry;\r\nboth are veiled in inscrutable mystery, the results only are within\r\nthe scope of our finite comprehension.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See the concluding part of Lecture VIII. § 46, Wonders\r\nof Geology, vol. ii. p. 890.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe publication of Mr. Parkinson's \"_Organic Remains of a former\r\nWorld_,\" at the commencement of the present century, must be regarded\r\nas a memorable event in the history of British Palæontology: it was\r\nthe first attempt to give a familiar and scientific account of the\r\nfossil relics of animals and plants, accompanied by figures of the\r\nspecimens described.\r\n\r\nThe three volumes[4] of which the work consisted, appeared at\r\nconsiderable intervals; the last was published in 1811. Although\r\nnearly forty years have since elapsed, and hundreds of geological\r\nworks, of all kinds and degrees of merit, have subsequently been\r\nissued, Mr. Parkinson's Plates, owing to their fidelity and beauty,\r\nare still in such request, as to induce the proprietor, Mr. Bohn, now\r\nthat the work is out of print, to publish them, with the descriptions\r\nand modern names of the fossils represented.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Three volumes, in 4to.; price 10_l._ 10_s._]\r\n\r\nI have added a few explanatory remarks, and in the \"Supplementary\r\nNotes,\" have given extended notices of some of the most interesting\r\nsubjects, with the view of rendering the volume more intelligible and\r\nacceptable to the general reader.\r\n\r\nIn looking through the original work of Mr. Parkinson, the instructed\r\nobserver will not fail to perceive the immense progress which the\r\nstudy of fossil animals and plants has made since the period of\r\nits first appearance in 1811. At that time, the terms Geology and\r\nPalæontology were unknown; all the sedimentary strata have since been\r\naccurately defined and arranged, and names assigned to the respective\r\nsystems or formations; while the so-called _Diluvial Epoch_, which\r\nMr. Parkinson, and even Baron Cuvier, considered as established\r\nby incontrovertible physical evidence, has been expunged from the\r\nchronology of geology. In Mr. Parkinson's volumes, no allusion will\r\nbe found to that most remarkable era in the earth's history which\r\nmodern researches have brought to light--_the Age of Reptiles_;\r\nthe terms Ichthyosauri, Plesiosauri, Iguanodon, Megalosaurus--now\r\nfamiliar as household words--are not inscribed on their pages; all\r\nthose marvellous beings of past ages have been discovered during the\r\nlast forty years; in short, the remark of an eminent critic is as\r\ntrue as it is beautiful:--\"Geology is a philosophy which never rests;\r\nits law is progress; a point which yesterday was invisible is its\r\ngoal to-day, and will be its starting-post to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nI gladly avail myself of this opportunity to make a passing allusion\r\nto the excellent and accomplished author, Mr. Parkinson. I had the\r\npleasure and privilege of his acquaintance in my youth, immediately\r\nafter the publication of the third volume of his valuable work. Mr.\r\nParkinson was rather below the middle stature, with an energetic,\r\nintelligent, and pleasing expression of countenance, and of mild\r\nand courteous manners; readily imparting information, either on his\r\nfavourite science, or on professional subjects; for he was at that\r\ntime actively engaged in medical practice in Hoxton Square, and\r\nwas the author of several valuable medical treatises. He kindly\r\nshowed and explained to me the principal objects in his cabinets,\r\nand pointed out every source of information on fossil remains; a\r\ndepartment of natural knowledge at that time but little cultivated\r\nin England, but which peculiar circumstances had contributed to\r\nrender the engrossing object of my young and ardent mind. In after\r\nyears Mr. Parkinson warmly encouraged my attempts to elucidate the\r\nnature of the strata and organic remains of my native county, Sussex,\r\na district which was then supposed to be destitute of geological\r\ninterest; and he revised my drawings, and favoured me with his\r\nremarks on many subjects treated of in my first work--\"_The Fossils\r\nof the South Downs_.\"[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Published in 1822.]\r\n\r\nIn 1822, Mr. Parkinson published \"An Introduction to the Study of\r\nFossil Organic Remains, especially of those found in the British\r\nStrata; intended to aid the Student in his Inquiries respecting\r\nthe Nature of Fossils, and their Connexion with the Formation of\r\nthe Earth;\" 1 vol. 8vo. with ten plates, principally of the genera\r\nof fossil shells. He also contributed a few papers to the early\r\nvolumes of the Geological Society of London, of which he was one of\r\nthe original members. After Mr. Parkinson's death, his beautiful\r\nand choice collection was sold by auction, and its contents widely\r\ndispersed. The fine series of silicified zoophytes was purchased by\r\nMr. Featherstonhaugh, and taken to America; and some years afterwards\r\nwas destroyed by a fire which consumed the museum in which it was\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of the pleasing style of Mr. Parkinson's work, I\r\nsubjoin an abstract of the chapter, _On the Pleasure and Advantages\r\nof a Knowledge of Fossil Remains_. The epistolary style was adopted;\r\nand the first letter is supposed to be penned by a friend desirous of\r\nlearning the nature of certain fossils he had observed on his journey\r\nto Oxford:--\r\n\r\n\"I have lived long enough to witness many sad disappointments to the\r\nfond dreams of happiness indulged by persons who, only intent on the\r\nacquisition of riches, had neglected to cultivate any intellectual or\r\nennobling pursuit; so that on retiring from active life, they were\r\nunable to enjoy the leisure so dearly earned by years of anxiety and\r\ncare, and either relapsed into a state of miserable ennui, or gave\r\nthemselves up to the excitement of frivolous or vicious indulgences.\r\n\r\n\"Aware of the necessity of devoting the few leisure hours, which\r\nthe duties of my calling left at my disposal, to some rational\r\nand amusing occupation, I have always cultivated, more or less\r\nassiduously, some branch of art or science, and thence acquired an\r\nenthusiastic admiration for the beauties of nature, and an insatiable\r\ncuriosity to pry into the mysteries of the natural world. With this\r\nstate of mind, I have at length resolved to avail myself of the means\r\nmy little fortune affords me to indulge those feelings, and have, I\r\ntrust, quitted the busy scenes of the world for ever.\r\n\r\n\"In pursuance of a plan long entertained of visiting the most\r\ninteresting parts of our island, I left London last week, accompanied\r\nby my daughter, and our old friend, Frank Wilton, whose lively\r\ndisposition and agreeable manners render him, as you well know, an\r\nexcellent companion. But he has made himself most acceptable to us\r\non another account;--his resolute scepticism with respect to the\r\nmore rational, and his submissive credulity as to the popular and\r\ntraditional explanations of such natural phenomena as are beyond his\r\ncomprehension, are frequently productive of remarks so quaint and\r\nhumorous, as to contribute in no small degree to our enjoyment.\r\n\r\n\"Ere our first day's journey was completed, I discovered how\r\ninsufficient was the knowledge I possessed to enable me to form\r\neven a conjecture, as to the nature of the very first objects which\r\nparticularly arrested our attention. We were within a few miles of\r\nOxford, when Wilton, looking out of the carriage window, exclaimed,\r\n'Bless me! never before did I see roads mended with such materials!'\r\nThis, of course, drew my attention to what had so strongly excited\r\nhis wonder; and I must confess that my astonishment was but little\r\nless than his own; for I beheld a labourer with a large hammer\r\nbreaking to pieces a nearly circular ornamented stone, half as\r\nlarge as the fore-wheel of our carriage, and resembling in form a\r\ncoiled-up serpent, or snake. We instantly stopped the chaise, and\r\ninquired of the man the name of the stone, and where it came from.\r\n'This, Sir,' he replied, 'is a _snake-stone_, and comes from yonder\r\nquarry, where there are thousands of them.' Upon hearing this, we all\r\nalighted, and with surprise examined some of the unbroken stones,\r\nwhich, though evidently bearing the form of an unknown animal, were\r\ncomposed of solid rock. As we sauntered along, the carriage following\r\nus, we came to a neat building on the road-side, which a sign in\r\nthe hedge opposite denoted to be a house of public entertainment.\r\nHoping to gain more satisfactory information respecting the objects\r\nthat had so much excited our curiosity, we entered this literally\r\nhedge ale-house, and on being shown into a neat room, the casement\r\nof which, surrounded by roses and honeysuckles in full bloom,\r\nopened into a garden redolent with fragrance and beauty, from the\r\nwild profusion of its flowers and shrubs, we determined to rest\r\nawhile, and partake of such refreshment as the cottage might afford.\r\nWhile these were preparing, Frank Wilton, whose restless curiosity\r\nleaves nothing unobserved, was examining the contents of the old\r\noaken mantel-shelf, and suddenly cried out, 'Well! if the object of\r\ntravelling is to behold novelties and wonders, surely this county\r\nwill afford that gratification in the highest degree; for among the\r\ncurious things on this mantel-piece, there is not one of which I\r\nhave ever seen its like before.' The articles now passed under my\r\nexamination, and with no better success; for I had never observed\r\nanything similar, nor could I form a rational conjecture respecting\r\ntheir nature.\r\n\r\n\"While thus engaged, our landlady made her appearance, and from her\r\nwe learnt that this was her collection of curiosities, gathered from\r\nthe neighbouring country; and she readily imparted to us all she knew\r\nof the subject. Taking up one of the stones, which resembled those\r\nwe had seen on the road,--'This,' she said, 'is a petrified snake,\r\nwith which this neighbourhood abounds. These were once fairies that\r\ninhabited these parts, and, for their crimes, were turned first into\r\nsnakes, and then into stones. Here'--showing a stone of a conical\r\nform--'is one of the fairies' night-caps,[6] now also become stone.'\r\n'Do, madam,' addressing Emma, 'pray observe this pattern; is it\r\npossible lace-work like this should ever have been worked by human\r\nhands? This--and this--are pieces of bones of giants, who lived\r\nhere after the fairies were destroyed.' These bones, she informed\r\nus, were frequently dug up in several parts of the county, as well\r\nas innumerable _thunderbolts_,[7] some of which she also showed us,\r\naffirming that they were the very thunderbolts by which the giants\r\nwere in their turn annihilated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: A Cidaris, or turban-echinite; see Plate LIII.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: _Belemnites_, popularly termed \"thunderbolts,\" Plate LIX.]\r\n\r\n\"We all listened attentively to this discourse, and on my smiling,\r\nwhen she withdrew, at the romantic account we had received, Wilton\r\nstrenuously defended our good landlady's narration, and declared, he\r\nthought it was not without a fair share of probability. On the return\r\nof our hostess, I did not venture to express any doubt of the truth\r\nof her story, but merely requested to know if she was aware of there\r\nbeing anywhere a more extensive collection of similar curiosities.\r\n'To be sure. Sir,' she replied, 'our University has a museum full of\r\nthem; and if you be going through Oxford, it will be well worth your\r\nwhile to see it.'\r\n\r\n\"After taking refreshment, we left our kind and communicative\r\nhostess, but not with an intention of immediately visiting the Museum\r\nof the University. On the contrary, I felt that, without some\r\nprevious knowledge of the objects to be examined, our curiosity would\r\nbe only excited, not gratified; and I resolved to defer our visit to\r\nOxford, until we had obtained the information necessary to insure\r\nus both pleasure and profit in the investigation of the relics of\r\ninterest it contained.\r\n\r\n\"Thus, my dear friend, at the very outset of my long anticipated\r\nholidays, I have experienced considerable disappointment, and I\r\nconfidently appeal to you to afford me the information I require;\r\nfor I know that you have successfully cultivated the science which\r\nteaches the nature of these figured stones, or petrifactions, and\r\npossess a valuable collection of these most extraordinary objects.\r\nYou now, therefore, have it in your power to add greatly to the\r\ndelight and instruction I am anticipating from my travels, by giving\r\nme an insight into the origin and nature of the petrified remains\r\nwhich, I am told, are every where to be met with in the districts we\r\nare about to visit.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Artis's Work, I need only mention that it was intended, as\r\nits title expresses, to illustrate \"_The Fossil Remains of Plants\r\npeculiar to the Coal Formations of Great Britain; selected for\r\ntheir novelty and interest from upwards of a Thousand Specimens in\r\nthe possession of the Author_; by Edmund Tyrell Artis, Esq.

Silicified wood, having a cavity lined with mammillated\r\n         chalcedony; appearing as if the silex had percolated through\r\n         the substance of the mass, and had slowly oozed into the\r\n         hollow.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 11. Silicified bituminous wood. In this specimen the\r\n         siliceous matter occurs in yellow semi-pellucid globules;\r\n         the colour is supposed to have been derived from the bitumen.\r\n\r\nThe silicified woods delineated above, belong to the division which\r\nMr. Parkinson denominated opaline; he conceived their peculiar\r\ncharacters to have resulted from an infiltration of fluid silex\r\ninto the ligneous tissue, which, having previously undergone\r\nbituminization, was in a permeable state; hence originated the\r\nconchoidal fracture and peculiar resinous lustre which these\r\nspecimens exhibit.\r\n\r\nThe specimen, fig. 7, Mr. Parkinson describes as corroborating the\r\nopinion that the ligneous tissues were converted into a bituminous\r\nsubstance, and subsequently impregnated with siliceous matter. \"In\r\nthat fossil there is a knot of wood which differs not the least\r\nin appearance from that in a recent piece, but it is perfectly\r\nimpregnated with opaline silex. Is it possible that the change this\r\nknot has suffered could have been effected by an abstraction of the\r\ngreater part or of the whole of its constituent molecules, and a\r\nsubstitution of particles of a different nature? Its hardness and\r\ncloseness of texture oppose an insuperable bar to the supposition:\r\nwhilst the mysteriousness of the change is entirely dispelled\r\nby admitting of the softening operation of bituminization, and\r\nconsequent admission of silex in a fluid state.\"--_Mr. Parkinson_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate III.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE III.\r\n\r\nPetrified Stems and Leaves.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.

I have purposely reserved the description of these\r\n         fossils for this place, because notwithstanding their close\r\n         resemblance to the aments or cones of a pine or larch, which\r\n         led the earlier collectors to regard them as fruits, they\r\n         do not belong to the vegetable but to the animal kingdom,\r\n         being the hardened excrementitious contents (_Coprolites_)\r\n         of the intestines of the fishes, with whose remains they are\r\n         associated in the chalk.[12] The specimens figured are from\r\n         Cherry Hinton, in Cambridgeshire; similar fossils occur in\r\n         the Chalk and Chalk-marl of Sussex, Kent, &c.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See Medals of Creation, vol. i. p. 432; and Dr.\r\nBuckland's Bridgewater Essays, vol. ii. pl. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate VII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE VII.\r\n\r\nFossil Fruits of Palms.\r\n\r\n  Figs. 1-5. Splendid specimens of one of the most remarkable of the\r\n         fossil fruits that occur in the London clay of the Isle of\r\n         Sheppey. The nut in its pericarp or husk is shown in fig. 1,\r\n         the separate pericarp in fig. 2, and the nut itself in fig.\r\n         3. Figs. 4 and 5, represent another beautiful fossil of the\r\n         same species.\r\n\r\nThese fossil fruits, which Mr. Parkinson considered as belonging\r\nto a species of Cocos, or Cocoa, and M. Brongniart referred to the\r\nPandanus or Screw-pine, Mr. Bowerbank has demonstrated to be closely\r\nrelated to the recent _Nipa_, or Malucca Palm; a low shrub-like\r\nmonocotyledonous plant, that inhabits marshy tracts near the mouths\r\nof great rivers, particularly where the waters are brackish.\r\n\r\nMr. Bowerbank has figured and described eleven species. The\r\nspecies represented in this plate is distinguished as _Nipadites\r\nParkinsonis_: M. Brongniart had previously named it _Pandanocarpum\r\nParkinsonis_.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: See an account of an \"Excursion to the Isle of\r\nSheppey,\" Medals of Creation, vol. ii. p. 897.]\r\n\r\nThe following is Mr. Bowerbank's description of these fossils:--\r\n\r\n\"The fruits of which the group I propose to name _Nipadites_ is\r\ncomposed, are known among the women and children by whom they are\r\nusually collected, by the name of '_petrified figs_.' The epicarp and\r\nendocarp are thin and membranous; the sarcocarp is thick and pulpy,\r\ncomposed of cellular tissue, through which run numerous bundles of\r\nvessels. The cells are about the 8/100th part of an inch in diameter.\r\nNearly in the centre of the pericarp is situated a large seed, which,\r\nwhen broken, is found to be more or less hollow. It is frequently\r\nnot more than half a line in thickness; but in perfect specimens it\r\npresents the appearance of a closely granulated structure, in which\r\nsmall apertures containing carbonaceous matter occasionally occur.\r\nThe seed in _Nipadites Parkinsonis_, consists of regular layers of\r\ncells radiating from a spot situated near the middle of the seed, and\r\napparently enclosing a central embryo.\r\n\r\n\"If the habits of the plants which produced these fossil fruits were\r\nsimilar to those of the recent _Nipa_, it will account for their\r\namazing abundance in the London Clay of the Isle of Sheppey; which\r\nformation, from the great variety of fossilized stems and branches,\r\nmixed up with _asteria_, _mollusca_, and _conchifera_ of numerous\r\nmarine and fresh-water genera, is strikingly characterized as having\r\nbeen the delta of an immense river, which probably flowed from near\r\nthe Equator towards the spot where these interesting remains are now\r\ndeposited.\"[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: History of the Fossil Fruits and Seeds of the London\r\nClay.

In that\r\n         beautiful work,--the continuation of which is much to be\r\n         desired,--the genus _Knorria_ comprises those fossil stems\r\n         in which the projecting scars of the petioles are densely\r\n         arranged in a spiral manner.[15]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Medals of Creation, vol. i. p. 161.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate X.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE X.\r\n\r\n(Plates X. to XXXIV. inclusive, are from Artis's work on the Fossil\r\nRemains of Plants, from the coal formations of Great Britain.)\r\n\r\n\"Columnar Hydatica.\"\r\n\r\nUnder the name _Hydatica_, Mr. Artis has described two species of\r\nfossil plants, from the coal-mine near Wentworth, Yorkshire. The\r\noriginals appear to have been aquatic plants, having a horizontal or\r\ncreeping stem, sending up slender branches, which floated by their\r\nleaves on the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThe generic characters are, \"Stem, arborescent, jointed, branched;\r\nleaves, long, linear.\"\r\n\r\nIn the arrangements of Schlotheim and Brongniart, who consider only\r\nthe construction of the leaves, these plants would belong to the\r\ngenus _Poacites_.\r\n\r\nThe species figured is named _Hydatica columnaris_, or Columnar\r\nHydatica. The stem is branched all the way up, and ends in a\r\nclub-like head; the branches are numerous, simple, alternate, and\r\ncovered with parallel hair-like leaves.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. The plant of the natural size, imbedded in coal-shale;\r\n         fig. 2, a branch magnified, showing; the two linear series\r\n         in which the leaves are arranged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XI.\r\n\r\n\"Prostrate Hydatica.\"\r\n\r\nA splendid specimen of another species of _Hydatica_, spread out on\r\nthe surface of the coal-shale, as if expanded on the bosom of the\r\nlake in which it grew: the length of the original, a part of which\r\nonly is figured in the plate, was eight feet, five inches.\r\n\r\nThis species is named by Mr. Artis, _Hydatica prostrata_. The stem is\r\njointed, and slightly striated; the joints are formed with irregular\r\nsutures, whence arise tufts of linear leaves resembling those of our\r\ncommon grasses.\r\n\r\nFragments of this fossil plant are abundant in the roofs of several\r\nof the chambers whence the coal has been extracted, in Elsecar\r\nColliery, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XII.\r\n\r\n\"Slender Myriophyllite.\"\r\n\r\nThe fossil here figured seems to approximate very closely to the\r\nHydatica; but Mr. Artis describes the plant under the generic name of\r\n_Myriophyllites_;--_M. gracilis_. The stem is herbaceous and slender,\r\nterminating in a point; it is thickly covered with hair-like leaves.\r\n\r\nIt was found imbedded horizontally, in detached masses, separated\r\nfrom the great mass of vegetable matter which covers the coal, by an\r\nintervening layer of shale. It is rarely met with in the same bed\r\nwith other vegetables, but generally in solitary and thin strata,\r\ntaking a horizontal position; so that by riving the shale which\r\ncontains these plants, numbers of them are disclosed on the same\r\nsurface. In its general aspect this fossil vegetable resembles the\r\ntrailing roots of some aquatic plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XIII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XIII.\r\n\r\n\"Branched Calamite.\"\r\n\r\nLong and large jointed stems, generally more or less flattened by\r\ncompression, and bearing some resemblance to a cane or bamboo, are\r\nvery abundant in the coal formations. Some of them attain many feet\r\nin length, and are of a corresponding magnitude in circumference.\r\nThe original plants are supposed to have been related to the\r\n_Equisetaceæ_, or Mare's-tail, and not to the _Bambusiæ_, and\r\nother arborescent grasses. The stem is jointed, and longitudinally\r\nstriated, having annular impressions at the articulations.\r\n\r\nThe present species (_Calamites ramosus_) has the stem arborescent\r\nand branched; the branches are cylindrical, striated, and inserted at\r\nthe articulations of the trunk; the articulations of the branches are\r\nsurrounded by a striated disk.\r\n\r\nThe stem has been found nine feet in length, and occurs both\r\nhorizontally and vertically, in sandstone, in Leabrook Quarry, near\r\nWentworth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XIV.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XIV.\r\n\r\n\"Doubtful Calamite.\"\r\n\r\nThese fossil stems are from the same sandstone quarry as the Calamite\r\ndelineated in the previous plate.\r\n\r\nThey differ in some respects from the usual type of the genus,\r\nhence the specific name (_Calamites dubius_). The striæ are narrow,\r\nand have a fine groove running down the middle; the fifth or sixth\r\narticulation is surrounded by a double line of large globular\r\nindentations, one row belonging to each of the connected joints;\r\nthese imprints have apparently been left by a zone of some organs\r\nwhich surrounded the articulations, and by its pressure left the\r\nindented frill, shown in the upper extremity of fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThese stems are generally found compressed, and from two to three\r\nfeet in length. Their termination is unknown.\r\n\r\nThis species is figured by M. Ad. Brongniart in Hist. Veg.

Immediately under this stratum there is a\r\nthin bed of very good coal; and at a considerable depth below this\r\nbed, there is a second layer of coal, eight feet thick, which is\r\ncovered in particular places with immense masses of fossil plants.\"\r\n\r\nThe species here figured very closely resembles the Bamboos. The\r\nstem is arborescent, and marked with parallel linear strife, which\r\nare intercepted at the sutures; it is simple and cylindrical, and\r\ncontracted at the articulations; it occurs five feet or more in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1, represents part of the middle of a stem.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2, shows the gradual upward diminution of the stem, and its\r\n         pointed termination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XVI.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XVI.\r\n\r\n\"Short-jointed Calamite.\"\r\n\r\n  (_Calamites approximatus_, Sternberg.\r\n   ---- ----, Brongniart, Hist.

The articulations are about one-fifth the diameter of the stem\r\napart. The tubercular studs, or warts, are probably the cicatrices\r\nof fallen leaves; they rise directly from the articulations, and not\r\nfrom the lower termination of the striæ, as in the species figured in\r\nthe next plate.\r\n\r\nThe specimen was found imbedded horizontally in soft sandstone, at\r\nthe bottom of the rock in Hober Quarry, near Wentworth.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1, represents a portion of the upper part of the trunk,\r\n         of the natural size, terminating at the top in a sharp\r\n         compressed point.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2.

The striæ are ornamented with tubercles at the bottom,\r\nclose to the articulation. The striæ are broader, and the tubercles\r\nlarger, towards the summit.\r\n\r\nThe stem is sometimes found two feet long, and from two to four\r\ninches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe situation of the tubercles at the lower extremity of the striæ,\r\nis a striking feature of this species; and the termination of the\r\nsummit of the stem is remarkable for its obtuseness.\r\n\r\nThe specimen is from Leabrook Quarry, Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XVIII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XVIII.\r\n\r\n\"Transverse Sternbergia.\"\r\n\r\n  (_Sternbergia transversa_, of Artis.\r\n   _Artesia_ ----, of Presl.

The stem is\r\nmarked longitudinally with double keels or ridges, which terminate at\r\ndifferent heights spirally round the stem, and have small tubercles\r\nat their terminations. There are likewise slight annular depressions,\r\nmostly distinct, but in some places two or more unite.\r\n\r\nThe stem is straight, simple, and cylindrical, and is compressed\r\ntowards the summit.

When found in an upright position, at right\r\nangles to the plane of the stratum, the original cylindrical form\r\nof the tree is commonly preserved; and many examples are now known\r\nof groups of erect Sigillariæ, with their roots extending into the\r\nsurrounding clay or sandy loam; the roots proving to be the fossil\r\nbodies called _Stigmariæ_, which were formerly supposed to be a\r\ndistinct family of aquatic plants.[16] The first discovery of this\r\nhighly interesting and unexpected fact was made by Mr. Binney.[17]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Dr. Buckland's Bridgewater Essay, vol. i. p. 476.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: See \"Supplementary Notes, p. 198.\"]\r\n\r\nThe specimen figured was found in an erect position in the sandstone\r\nof a quarry at Rowmarsh, near Rotherham in Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nThe stem is simple, the furrows small and wavy, impressed with dots\r\non the ridges. The cicatrices are ovate, subpentagonal, with the\r\nlower angles rounded, having a single gland near the lower extremity.\r\nThe stem is three feet long, and four inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe transverse section, as seen in fig. 1, shows traces of a double\r\nconcentric ring, as if produced by internal structure. Fig. 2,\r\ndisplays the equality of the stem throughout its entire length, and\r\nits abrupt termination.

In their external forms they somewhat resembled the\r\nCacteæ or Euphorbiæ, but were more nearly related by their internal\r\norganization to the Zamiæ or Cycadeæ. The leaves and fruits of these\r\ntrees are unknown, for no satisfactory connexion has been established\r\nbetween the stems, and the foliage and seed vessels with which they\r\nare sometimes collocated.\"[18]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: Medals of Creation, vol. i. p. 138.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XX.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XX.\r\n\r\n\"Sigillaria.\"\r\n\r\n  (_Euphorbites vulgaris_, of Artis.)\r\n\r\nThis species is characterized by the remarkable fish-like form of\r\nthe cicatrices left by the base of the leaf-stalks, and by the\r\nrapid tapering of the upper part of the stem, as shown in the\r\nreduced figure 1, which represents a specimen nine feet long, five\r\nfeet in circumference at the base, and only twenty-one inches in\r\ncircumference at the upper end.\r\n\r\nThe ridges, which at the superior extremity are simple and narrow,\r\nand parted only by a single line, become at the lower part of the\r\nstem wide and flat, and are separated by a groove of equal breadth,\r\nas seen in fig. 3, which is taken from B, fig. 1.\r\n\r\nFig. 2, represents a portion towards the upper end, at A, fig. 1; and\r\nexhibits the different appearance of the bark, and the under surface,\r\nwhen the cortical investment is removed; the imprints in each case\r\ndiffering very much in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe specimen from which the drawing was taken, was from a sandstone\r\nquarry near Altofts, in Yorkshire.

These bodies are more or less regularly cylindrical, and vary\r\nin length from a few inches to fifteen or twenty feet, the largest\r\nbeing several inches in diameter. Their surface is covered with\r\nnumerous oval or circular depressions, in the middle of each of which\r\nthere is a rounded papilla, or tubercle. These variolæ are disposed\r\nround the stem in quincunx order. When these roots are broken across,\r\na small cylindrical core or pith is exposed, which extends in a\r\nlongitudinal direction throughout the stem, like a medullary column.\r\nThis central axis, which is often separable from the surrounding\r\nmass, is composed of bundles of vascular tissue disposed in a\r\nradiated manner, and separated from each other by medullary rays.\r\nThis internal organization presents the same correspondence with that\r\nof the stems of Sigillariæ, as does the structure of the roots of a\r\ndicotyledonous tree with that of its branches and stems.\r\n\r\nThe Stigmariæ are almost invariably present in the bed called the\r\n\"Under Clay,\" which underlies the coal, and when observed in this\r\nsituation, long tapering sub-cylindrical fibres are found attached to\r\nthe tubercles; and these processes or rootlets are often several feet\r\nin length. Their form and mode of attachment are shown at C, D; the\r\nrootlets terminate in bifurcations, as seen at A, B.\r\n\r\nThe specimen here figured is part of a root nearly six feet long, and\r\nthree inches in diameter; some of the rootlets were two feet long. It\r\nis imbedded in shale; from Elsecar colliery.[19]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: A Stigmaria with rootlets, many feet in length, is\r\nplaced over the doorway in the room devoted to fossil vegetables in\r\nthe Gallery of Organic Remains in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XXII.\r\n\r\n\"Warty Stigmaria.\"\r\n\r\n  (_Stigmaria ficoides_, Brongniart.\r\n   _Phytolithus verrucosus_, Martin's Petrificata Derbiensia, Pl.

Some\r\nof these trees have been found almost entire, from their roots to the\r\ntopmost branches.

Notwithstanding the profusion with which the foliage of\r\nmany kinds of ferns is distributed throughout the coal formation,\r\nthe undoubted stems of tree-ferns are so rare, that it may admit\r\nof question whether some of the leaves which from the analogy of\r\ntheir structure to recent forms have been referred to the ferns,\r\nmay not have belonged to the stems of unknown trees with which\r\nthey are associated in the strata; for as, in the animal kingdom,\r\ndistinct types of living organisms are often found blended in the\r\nextinct races, so in the vegetable, it is possible, that foliage and\r\nstems, of apparently discordant types, may have belonged to the same\r\nextinct species or genus of trees. This problem can only be solved\r\nby diligent and continued research in the richest localities of\r\ncoal-plants.\r\n\r\nM. Brongniart remarks that every bed of coal is the product of a\r\nspecial vegetation, often different from that which preceded, and\r\nthat which followed it. Each bed thus resulting from a distinct\r\nvegetation, is characterized by the predominance of certain\r\nimpressions of plants, and the experienced miners distinguish in many\r\ncases the beds they are working, by their practical knowledge of the\r\nplants that prevail.\r\n\r\nThe same beds of coal, and the deposits which cover it, ought\r\ntherefore to contain the different parts of the plants that were\r\nliving at the period of its formation; and by carefully studying the\r\nassociation of these different fossils, forming thus little special\r\nfloras, generally of but few species, we may hope to acquire data\r\nby which we may advance the means of reconstructing the anomalous\r\nvegetable forms of the ancient world. M. Brongniart strongly urges\r\nattention to this circumstance in the examination of the coal strata,\r\nwith the view of determining the identity of the scattered leaves,\r\nstems, and fruits, in any particular stratum. By such a procedure,\r\nmuch addition would be made to our knowledge of the entire structures\r\nof many of the fossil plants of which we now only know the fragments.\r\nThus we may hope to ascertain the foliage of the Sigillariæ,\r\nthe roots of which, by a similar method, have but recently been\r\ndetermined to be the fossils called _Stigmariæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXXIII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\"Carpolithe, or Fossil Seed-vessel.\"\r\n\r\n  (_Carpolithus marginatus_, of Artis.)\r\n\r\nThe carbonized husks or shells of nuts, and other carpolithes,\r\nor seed-vessels, are not unfrequently met with in the coal and\r\ncoal-shale.

The fossil, however, though somewhat resembling\r\nthe recent coral in its general form, belongs to an extinct genus.\r\n\r\nThis Syringopora appears to have been very abundant in the sea\r\nin which the strata of mountain or carboniferous limestone were\r\ndeposited, for it forms entire beds of great extent. A beautifully\r\nfigured marble results from this coral, when the interstices of its\r\ntubes have been filled up with compact calcareous matter. A small\r\npolished slab is represented in fig. 2. At Matlock, vases, and other\r\nornamental articles, are made of it; and the sections of the coral\r\ntubes impart considerable variety of figures.[25]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: Articles of this kind may be obtained of Mr. Tennant,\r\n149, Strand.]\r\n\r\nSome slabs of this fossil coral are of a dull red hue, which there\r\nis every reason to conclude is due to the colour of the original;\r\nand not only are traces of the natural tints of the living zoophyte\r\npreserved, but even the animal membrane of the coral; and this may\r\nbe exposed by immersing a fragment of the marble in dilute muriatic\r\n(hydrochloric) acid. Mr. Parkinson thus describes the result of his\r\nfirst experiment:--\r\n\r\n\"A fragment of the marble (Plate XXXIV. fig. 2) was exposed to the\r\naction of muriatic acid in a very dilute state. As the calcareous\r\nearth was dissolved, and the carbonic acid escaped, I was delighted\r\nto observe the membranaceous substance appear, depending from the\r\nstone in light, flocculent, elastic flakes. Many of these retained\r\na deep red colour, and appeared in a beautiful and distinct manner,\r\nalthough not absolutely retaining the form of the tubipore. A\r\nfaithful representation of this appearance is given in fig. 3.\"\r\n\r\nThis experiment of Mr. Parkinson was highly important, as proving\r\nthe previously almost incredible fact, that animal membrane,\r\nwhen hermetically sealed, as it were, in the solid stone, was as\r\nindestructible as the rock itself. It suggested, too, the probability\r\nthat vestiges of other animal tissues might be traced in organic\r\nremains, and encouraged subsequent observers to seek for evidence of\r\nthe soft parts of animal bodies entombed in the strata. It was the\r\nfirst step in the right direction, and led to the detection of many\r\nhighly interesting phenomena. In Dr. Buckland's Bridgewater Essay\r\nwill be found figures and descriptions of the eyes of crustacea: of\r\nthe wings, elytra or wing-covers, and the integuments of the body of\r\ninsects; of the skin of reptiles; and, in the \"Wonders of Geology,\"\r\nand \"Medals of Creation,\" of the membranes of the air-bladder,\r\nand of the capsule of the eye of fishes; of the soft parts of the\r\nanimalcules called foraminifera, &c. The bodies of mollusca, or\r\nshell-fish, converted into a dark brown mass (_mollushite_), occur\r\nin such abundance in some deposits, as to yield a rich manure from\r\nthe quantity of phosphate of lime. The excrementitious substances\r\ntermed by Dr. Buckland \"Coprolites,\" are also used for agricultural\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXXV.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XXXV.\r\n\r\nThe subjects here figured are Fossil Corals.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.

(_Catenipora escharoides._) The fossil here delineated is\r\n         well known to collectors by the name of \"_chain-coral_\"\r\n         derived from the elegant cateniform markings produced by\r\n         transverse sections of the parallel tubes, which being of an\r\n         oval form, and in close apposition, give rise to chain-like\r\n         figures, as shown in figs. 5 and 6. From Dudley.\r\n\r\nThis fossil coral abounds in that division of the Silurian formation\r\ntermed the Wenlock or Dudley limestones, wherever these deposits\r\noccur. The most exquisite specimens are obtained from the Falls of\r\nthe Ohio, at Louisville, in the United States of America. A coral\r\nreef of the Silurian epoch here exists in the bed of the mighty\r\nstream of fresh water, almost as perfect as when growing in its\r\nnative sea! The river dashes over the entire mass in the season\r\nof high water; but in those periods when the stream is low, the\r\nridge of coral is exposed, and its surface then presents the most\r\nextraordinary display of Silurian corals, of numerous species and\r\ngenera, standing in relief on the more compact masses of the rock.\r\nThe substance of the corals, being siliceous, resists the action\r\nof the cataract, while the softer calcareous matter which filled\r\nup the interstices of the tubes, lamellæ, &c. of the zoophytes, is\r\nwashed away atom by atom; and natural dissections are formed, which\r\nart would in vain attempt to imitate. Dr. Yandell, of the Medical\r\nCollege, Louisville, and Dr. Clapp, of New Albany, have splendid\r\ncollections from the Falls, which every geologist and intelligent\r\ntraveller who visits Kentucky should not fail to examine: the masses\r\nof Astreæ, Madrepores, &c. are so fresh in their aspect, as not to be\r\nreadily distinguished from the recent specimens of the same genera\r\nwhich are placed beside them.[26]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: See Sir Charles Lyell's Travels in the United States;\r\nand Drs.

A silicified branched sponge, (_Spongites lobatus_, of\r\n         Dr. Fleming,) from the chalk of Berkshire.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 9, is a beautiful silicified, lobate, spongoid body,\r\n         (_Siphonia_,) probably from the greensand. Siliceous\r\n         cruciform spicula obtained from this fossil are represented\r\n         in fig. 8.\r\n\r\nZoophytes of this kind, like many of the sponges, have their tissues\r\nstrengthened by, and largely composed of spicula, which vary in\r\nform and size in the different species and genera. Many sponges and\r\nSiphoniæ in flint, and in the chert of the greensand, consist almost\r\nentirely of spicula, which may be easily detected by a slightly\r\nmagnifying power.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 10. Another common Dudley Coral. (_Porites pyriformis_, of\r\n         Mr. Lonsdale.)\r\n\r\n  Fig. 11. A beautiful coral (_Explanaria flexuosa_, of Dr.\r\n         Fleming), from the Coral Rag of Steeple Ashton, Wilts. The\r\n         outline indicates the mode of increase, according to Mr.\r\n         Parkinson, of this form of zoophyte.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 12. This is a portion of a delicate ramose sponge\r\n         (_Spongites ramosus_, of Mantell), whose remains are\r\n         abundant in the chalk-flints, and have given rise to the\r\n         irregularly branched siliceous nodules. A specimen nine\r\n         inches long, with seven branches, is figured in Fossils of\r\n         the South Downs, Pl. XV. fig. 11. Siliceous spicula are\r\n         thickly interspersed throughout the mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XL.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XL.\r\n\r\nFossil Corals, &c.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. The shells of Oysters, and other mollusca, are subjected\r\n         to the ravages of a parasitical sponge, (_Cliona_, of Dr.\r\n         Grant,) which is beset with minute siliceous spines or\r\n         spicula, and inhabits hollows formed in the substance of the\r\n         shell. Shells thus honeycombed, as it were, may often be\r\n         found on the sea-shore with the excavated parts filled up\r\n         by sponge. I have shells collected by my eldest son on the\r\n         shores of New Zealand, that are hollowed out in a similar\r\n         manner, and occupied by sponge. Whether these cavities are\r\n         produced by mechanical means, or are the result of the\r\n         decay and absorption of the shell induced by the growth of\r\n         the parasite, are questions still undetermined. There are\r\n         several kinds of shells found fossil, which were infested\r\n         with a similar parasitical sponge; and when the cavities\r\n         thus produced have been filled up by flint, and the shell\r\n         has subsequently decomposed, or been worn away, the surface\r\n         of the flint is studded with the casts of the cells, in\r\n         the form of small irregular globular bodies, connected by\r\n         filaments or strings of flint. The fossil, fig. 1, is a\r\n         fossil of this kind, described by Mr. Parkinson as being\r\n         \"covered with minute round bodies, the nature of which is\r\n         unknown;\" fig. 12, is an enlarged view of five of these\r\n         globular casts connected by filaments.\r\n\r\nThe origin of these fossils was first pointed out by the Rev. W.\r\nConybeare.[29] The fibrous shells of a fossil genus of bivalves named\r\n_Inoceramus_, of which several species abound in the Chalk, appear\r\nto have been particularly subjected to depredations of this kind.\r\nHence among partially water-worn flints, specimens of the siliceous\r\ncasts are common; figs. 8, and 10, are examples from the Hackney\r\ngravel-pits.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: See Medals of Creation, vol. i. p. 396, fig. 94.]\r\n\r\nMr. Morris has named these fossils, _Clionites_; fig. 1, is _C.\r\nParkinsoni_.\r\n\r\n  Figs. 2, 4, 7, are portions of a recent species of jointed\r\n         zoophyte (_Isis_), from a modern concretionary deposit on\r\n         the shores of the Mediterranean, Sicily.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3. A branched fossil coral (_Millepora ramosa_, of Dr.\r\n         Fleming), imbedded in compact oolitic limestone from\r\n         Wiltshire. A portion of the surface magnified is represented\r\n         in fig. 11.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 5, appears to be a fungiform Spongite; its locality is not\r\n         mentioned.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 6. Portion of a fossil coral (_Ceriopora_), from\r\n         Switzerland.\r\n\r\n  Figs. 8, & 10. These pebbles have the surface covered with casts\r\n         of Clionites (_Clionites Conybeari_, of Mr. Morris.[30])\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Mr. Morris thus defines the generic character of these\r\nfossil bodies:--\"Reticular masses of a more or less compressed\r\nglobular, elliptical, or polygonal form; rugose and sometimes\r\npapillose; connected by minute tubuli or fibrillæ. Dendritical,\r\ndichotomous, or irregularly aggregated.\" _Clionites Conybeari_ is\r\ncharacterized by \"Cells irregular, somewhat polygonal, with one\r\nor more papillæ; surface finely tuberculated, connecting threads\r\nnumerous.\" Note from Mr. Morris, April, 1850.\r\n\r\nThe fossils, however, do not appear to be the silicified sponge\r\n(_Cliona_) by which the ravages in the shell have been effected; they\r\nare merely casts of the cavities produced.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 9.

The fossil\r\ndelineated is from Touraine in France, and is one of the most perfect\r\nexamples of this kind hitherto observed. It belongs to a group\r\nof cup-shaped _Amorphozoa_, (as these organisms are now named by\r\nnaturalists, from the great irregularity of shape which they assume,)\r\ntermed _Chenendopora_. The original organic substance is transmuted\r\ninto silex, and the interstices are filled up with carbonate of\r\nlime. The same species occurs in the greensand in the Vale of\r\nPewsey in Wiltshire, and, I believe, also in the white-chalk; for\r\nmany cyathiform flints from the South Downs appear to have the same\r\ninternal structure.\r\n\r\nIn the so-called \"gravel-pits,\" near Faringdon, in Berkshire,--which\r\nare quarries of a loosely-aggregated grit of the greensand, almost\r\nwholly made up of the relics of shells, corals, amorphozoa,\r\n&c.--numerous sponges of this genus are met with. One beautiful\r\nspecies (_Chenendopora fungiformis_) has acquired, from its cup-like\r\nform, the local name of \"petrified salt-cellar.\"[31]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Wonders of Geology, vol. ii. p. 637; and Medals of\r\nCreation, \"Excursion to Faringdon,\" vol. ii. p. 923.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLII.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XLII.\r\n\r\nThe Fossils represented in this Plate are chiefly Zoophytes in Flint.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. A flint from the gravel-pits at Hackney. Its form is\r\n         derived from the enclosed zoophyte, part of whose structure\r\n         is exposed in the upper portion of the figure. This\r\n         fossil zoophyte (_Choanites Königi_, of Mantell) is very\r\n         abundant in some of the chalk strata, and many of the most\r\n         beautifully marked pebbles cut and polished for brooches by\r\n         the lapidaries of Brighton, Bognor, and the Isle of Wight,\r\n         are the silicified soft parts of this animal. The original\r\n         was of a subglobular form, and probably of a soft fleshy\r\n         consistence; it had a deep central cavity, whence numerous\r\n         tubes diverged, and ramified throughout the mass; it was\r\n         fixed at the base by radicle or root-like processes.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: See Medals of Creation, p. 264. \"Thoughts on a Pebble,\"\r\n(eighth edition,) contains coloured figures and a full description of\r\nthese fossils.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. This is another characteristic and abundant fossil\r\n         zoophyte of the chalk and flint. The specimen figured\r\n         is a water-worn pebble, and therefore gives but obscure\r\n         indications of the form and structure of the original.\r\n         The fungiform flints--called in Sussex petrified\r\n         mushrooms--belong to the same genus (_Ventriculites_, of\r\n         Mantell): and highly interesting specimens occur in which\r\n         some part of the zoophyte is invested with flint, and\r\n         the other part expanded in the chalk. The original was\r\n         probably a polyparium--that is, the skeleton or support of\r\n         an aggregation of coral-polypes--of a funnel shape, the\r\n         polype-shells being situated on the inner surface: the base\r\n         was attached by root-like fibres.[33] The polype-cells are\r\n         cylindrical and regular, and clusters of beautiful casts of\r\n         them often occur on flints.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Consult Medals of Creation, pp. 270-279: and Wonders of\r\nGeology, sixth edition, p. 638.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3. This specimen is described by Mr. Parkinson as \"a\r\n         pear-shaped alcyonite from Switzerland.\" It is probably one\r\n         of those fossil zoophytes allied to the sponges (called\r\n         _Siphonia_), in which the upper part is of a bulbous or\r\n         pear-like form, and is supported by a stem with root-like\r\n         processes at the base. The bulb has a central cavity\r\n         studded with irregular pores, that communicates with the\r\n         parallel longitudinal tubes of which the stem is composed: a\r\n         structure admitting of that ready ingress and egress of the\r\n         sea-water, which this class of organisms requires. There are\r\n         numerous species in the greensand of the chalk formation.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Medals of Creation, p. 258, Lign. 56.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 4.

A Ventriculite from a gravel-pit; the markings are\r\n         produced by the exposed and partially abraded outer\r\n         integument, which in perfect examples consists of a regular\r\n         net-work of sub-cylindrical fibres.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 7, is a transverse section of a Siphonia (_Siphonia\r\n         pyriformis_ of Goldfuss).\r\n\r\n  Fig. 8. A nearly perfect specimen of a similar fossil. In fig. 7,\r\n         are shown sections of tubes passing from the periphery to\r\n         the centre; in fig. 8, the central aperture of the cavity of\r\n         the bulb, and part of the stem, are displayed.\r\n\r\n  Figs. 9, & 10, are imperfect specimens of Choanites: fig. 10,\r\n         is a vertical section showing the central cavity and the\r\n         connected tubes.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 11, is another example of _Siphonia pyriformis_.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 12, a vertical, and fig. 13, a transverse section, of the\r\n         same species of Siphonia.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 14.

A pebble enclosing part of the base of a Ventriculite;\r\n         the circular spots on the large end are sections of the\r\n         ramifications of the stirps or base of the zoophyte; for\r\n         this figure and the following are drawn in an inverted\r\n         position.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 16, is a similar fossil, split vertically, and showing the\r\n         enclosed stem of the Ventriculite.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLIV.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE XLIV.\r\n\r\nFossil Zoophytes.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. A spongite (_Scyphia costata_, of Goldfuss), from\r\n         Switzerland. The fossil spongeous bodies named _Scyphia_,\r\n         are characterized by the \"mass or body being either\r\n         cylindrical, simple or branched; fistulous, and terminating\r\n         in a rounded pit; entirely composed of a firm reticulated\r\n         tissue.\"[35] Like the other bodies comprised in the group\r\n         of Amorphozoa, the form in this genus is exceedingly\r\n         diversified, and as the structure is often but obscurely\r\n         shown, the determination of these fossils is oftentimes\r\n         impossible. It is however convenient, in the present state\r\n         of our knowledge, to distinguish the principal kinds by\r\n         names which may be modified or abandoned, when the structure\r\n         and natural affinities of the original organisms are more\r\n         accurately determined.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Medals of Creation, p. 237.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. Another species of Scyphia from Switzerland; a small\r\n         portion of the surface magnified is seen at _a_.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3. The peculiar form and tissue of another genus of\r\n         Amorphozoa (_Cnemidium rimulosum_, of Goldfuss), are shown\r\n         in this beautiful specimen.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 4, is a section of a chalk flint, from Wycombe Heath; the\r\n         purple body, partially invested by a white border, is\r\n         evidently a mass of the soft parts of some zoophyte, which\r\n         served as a nucleus to the siliceous nodule. A purple\r\n         or pink hue often prevails in the sections of zoophytes\r\n         immersed in flint, and doubtless depends on the original\r\n         colour of the living animal.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 5. A very fine spongite (_Chenendopora fungiformis_, of\r\n         Michelin), from France.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 6. This is evidently a fossil zoophyte, but the structure\r\n         exposed is not sufficiently characteristic to determine the\r\n         genus.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 7. A beautiful fungiform Scyphia.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 8. This elegant specimen, which Mr. Parkinson highly valued,\r\n         is evidently a _Choanite_ imbedded in flint. The body\r\n         retains a pink colour, and is surrounded by a white band,\r\n         which is probably the remains of the cortical or external\r\n         tissue of the original zoophyte. I have seen many transverse\r\n         sections in which the central mass was either of a pink or\r\n         purple colour, and encircled by a white zone, in the squared\r\n         flints of the walls of churches and other ancient edifices\r\n         in Sussex.[36]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: Polished specimens of the pebbles of the Isle of Wight,\r\nexhibiting sections of the Choanites, Ventriculites, &c., may be\r\nobtained of _Mr. Fowlestone_, Lapidary, 4, Victoria Arcade, Ryde;\r\nwho also has generally on sale a good series of the fossils of the\r\nIsland.

Specimen of a recent _Pentacrinus Caput Medusæ_, from the\r\n         Caribbean Sea.\r\n\r\nThe Lily-shaped animals (_Crinoidea_), so named from a fancied\r\nresemblance of some species when in a state of repose to a closed\r\nlily, may be compared to a Feather-star (_Comatula_) fixed to\r\na jointed column, with its mouth upwards; the base of the stem\r\nbeing attached to the rock by root-like processes. The only known\r\nliving genus inhabits the seas of the West Indies, and the specimen\r\nfigured represents the body (or upper part of the animal), with a\r\nconsiderable portion of the stem remaining attached. The Crinoidea\r\nare divided into two groups; Encrinites, having the ossicula\r\n(little bones) of the stem rounded, and Pentacrinites, in which the\r\nossicula of the column are pentagonal, or angular. The Crinoidea are\r\ncharacterized by having a fixed base, a column or stem composed of\r\nnumerous separate articulated pieces of a solid calcareous substance,\r\nsupporting on its summit a vase, or receptacle, formed by a series\r\nof closely adjusted plates, which contain the body, or viscera. The\r\nupper part of the receptacle is covered by a plated integument, on\r\none side of which an aperture or mouth is placed. From the upper\r\nmargin proceed five articulated tentacula or arms, which subdivide\r\ninto branches that in some species are very numerous and of extreme\r\ntenuity. On the inside, the arms are beset with articulated cirri or\r\nfeelers. The joints composing the column are perforated by a central\r\nopening; there are also side-arms, that radiate from the column in\r\ngroups of five at different points. When the animal is alive, the\r\nskeleton is covered by a soft integument, as in the star-fishes, and\r\nthe arms spread out and expand, forming a net, by which living prey\r\nis captured and conveyed to the mouth by the tentacula, in the same\r\nmanner as in the fresh-water polype or Hydra.\r\n\r\nThe fossil remains of Crinoidea consist of the ossicula of the\r\ncolumn, arms, and tentacula; of the plates of the vase, or\r\nreceptacle; and of the peduncle, or base of attachment. This family\r\nof Radiaria, though now of such excessive rarity, swarmed in the\r\nseas that deposited the ancient secondary strata; whole mountain\r\nchains and extensive tracts of country are composed of strata almost\r\nentirely made up of their fossil remains.[38] The number and species\r\nof genera is very great.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Wonders of Geology, vol. ii. p. 645. Medals of\r\nCreation, p. 312.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2, is a remarkably beautiful specimen of the receptacle of\r\n         a Pentacrinite from Gloucestershire, showing the arms\r\n         introverted, as if the animal had suddenly perished while in\r\n         the act of closing over its prey; the stem is wanting.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3.

It is not within the plan of this work to give detailed\r\ndescriptions of these numerous detached parts; a few of the most\r\ninteresting objects only will be particularized.\r\n\r\nThe specimens figured in the upper part of the plate, figs. 1 to 28,\r\nare cylindrical ossicula, and portions of stems of Encrinites: those\r\nin the lower division are for the most part pentagonal, and therefore\r\nbelong to Pentacrinites.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 24. The \"Tortoise Encrinite,\" of Mr. Parkinson, (_Marsupites\r\n         Milleri_, of Mantell,) from the chalk of Kent. The specimen\r\n         figured is the receptacle or body of a very remarkable\r\n         crinoideal animal which forms the link that unites the\r\n         Lily-shaped animals with the Star-fishes; like the former,\r\n         the receptacle is composed of articulated plates, closed\r\n         at the top by a tessellated plate-work with a buccal\r\n         aperture, and surrounded by five flexible arms; but the\r\n         original animal, like the Star-fishes, was destitute of a\r\n         stem, and could float through the water at pleasure. Its\r\n         true structure was first pointed out by me in 1822;[39] the\r\n         name Marsupite was suggested by the purse-like form. In the\r\n         figure, the base of the receptacle is uppermost. Fig. 30, is\r\n         a single plate of a Marsupite attached to a piece of chalk.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: See \"Fossils of the South Downs.\"]\r\n\r\n  Figs. 31, 35, 38, 39, 40, 41, 74, 75, 76, 77. These are portions\r\n         of a small species of Encrinite (_Apiocrinus ellipticus_)\r\n         peculiar to the white chalk, in some localities of which the\r\n         detached ossicula and peduncles are abundant. At Northfleet,\r\n         near Gravesend, these fossils are often met with. Figs. 75,\r\n         and 76, are portions of the receptacle with part of the\r\n         column; figs. 31, 38, and 39, are parts of the processes of\r\n         attachment. I have never seen any specimen with the arms.[40]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Medals of Creation, p. 321.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 34. This is part of the receptacle and stem of another small\r\n         chalk Encrinite (_Bourgeticrinus_, of D'Orbigny) from Kent;\r\n         it is remarkable for the very slight increase in bulk of the\r\n         receptacle, and the peculiar form of the plates of which it\r\n         is composed.\r\n\r\n  Figs. 36 & 37. Two views of the receptacle of a very remarkable\r\n         crinoidean animal (_Pentremites florealis_, of Say), from\r\n         the cherty carboniferous limestone of Kentucky. This\r\n         zoophyte, though resembling the Crinoidea in having a\r\n         plated receptacle supported by an articulated stem, has a\r\n         remarkable affinity to the Sea-urchins (_Echinidæ_) in the\r\n         porous bands and pentagonal aperture, and in being destitute\r\n         of arms or tentacula. Some of the Kentucky limestone beds\r\n         swarm with the remains of these zoophytes.[41]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 41: Medals of Creation, p. 327.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 47. \"Two ossicula of the Lily Encrinite immersed in diluted\r\n         muriatic acid, by which the animal membrane was exposed,\r\n         and is seen hanging in flocculæ from the bottom of the\r\n         fossil,\"--_Mr. Parkinson._\r\n\r\n  Figs. 57, 64, 66.

The\r\nspecimen figured is a charming example of the \"_Stone Lily_\" partly\r\nexpanded, attached to a block of limestone studded with encrinal\r\nossicula. Mr. Parkinson informed me that it was formerly in the\r\ncollection of Mr. Jacob Forster, and cost him twenty guineas; from\r\nfive to ten guineas is now the usual price for a specimen in a good\r\nstate of preservation, with any part of the column attached. This\r\nEncrinite is not known to occur in England. The specimens seen in\r\ncollections are for the most part from Lower Saxony: this species has\r\nonly been found in the limestone strata called \"_Muschelkalk_\" one\r\nof the subdivisions of the _Trias_, or New Red Sandstone formation,\r\nof Germany.[43] The most celebrated locality of these fossils is\r\nin Brunswick, near the village of Erkerode, about two miles from\r\nthe town bearing the same name. The bed in which they are found is\r\na soft argillaceous cream-coloured limestone, about one foot and a\r\nhalf in thickness; and the stone is composed chiefly of trochites, or\r\ndetached ossicula of the stems, and a few fragile shells and corals.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: Medals of Creation, vol. i. p. 322. Wonders of Geology,\r\nvol. ii. pp. 534, 549.]\r\n\r\nAn elaborate account of the structure of the skeleton of the Lily\r\nEncrinite is given by Mr. Miller, in his valuable work, \"The\r\nNatural History of the Lily-shaped Animals,\" (1 vol. 4to. 1821.)\r\nMr. Parkinson had previously carefully investigated the different\r\nparts which enter into the composition of the receptacle and column,\r\nand had given them names analogous to those employed to designate\r\nthe bones of the skeleton in vertebrated animals. This nomenclature\r\nhas very properly been abandoned; but I subjoin Mr. Parkinson's\r\ndescription of the figures, to record his ingenuity and skill in\r\ndissecting organic remains:--\r\n\r\n  \"Fig. 1, The Lily Encrinite, with part of its vertebral column\r\n         attached. In this specimen is seen the extensive capacity\r\n         for motion yielded by the peculiar form of the vertebra;\r\n         in the superior part of the column; and by the fortunate\r\n         removal of a portion of the fingers, a fair view is given of\r\n         the natural arrangement of the tentacula.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2.

On Middleton Moor, near Matlock, extensive quarries\r\nof this marble are worked, and good specimens of the ossicula and\r\nstems may be easily obtained.[44]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 44: See Medals of Creation for \"A Geological Excursion from\r\nMatlock to Middleton Moor, returning by Stonnis,\" p. 968.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 4.

The\r\nlamented Mr. Channing Pearce, and his father (now of Percy Place,\r\nGrosvenor, Bath), when resident at Bradford, paid such unremitting\r\nattention to the collection of these fossils, that perfect specimens\r\nwere obtained, exhibiting the entire structure of the originals;\r\nof these some fine examples are preserved in the British Museum.\r\nSir Charles Lyell mentions a very interesting fact relating to the\r\noccurrence of these Crinoidea in the strata. He states that the\r\nupper surface of a bed of limestone at Bradford is incrusted with a\r\ncontinuous pavement formed by the stony roots of the Apiocrinites;\r\nand upon this is a layer of clay in which are the stems and bodies\r\n(receptacles) of innumerable examples; some erect, others lying\r\nprostrate; while throughout the clay are scattered detached arms,\r\nstems, and receptacles. This submarine forest of Crinoideans must\r\ntherefore have flourished in the clear sea-water till invaded by a\r\ncurrent loaded with mud, which overwhelmed the living zoophytes, and\r\nentombed them in the argillaceous deposit in which their remains are\r\nnow imbedded.[45]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 45: See Wonders of Geology, vol. ii. p. 653.]\r\n\r\nThe receptacle of this Apiocrinite is pyriform and very smooth, the\r\nplates are large and thin, with radiating articulated surfaces; the\r\nstem is short, smooth, and strong, the arms are simple, and like\r\nthose of the Marsupite; the peduncle spreads out into an expanded\r\nbase, which is firmly attached to the rock; sections of this part are\r\ngenerally of a purple colour.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1.

The \"Nave Encrinite\" (_Actinocrinus triacontadactylus_,\r\n         or thirty-fingered, of Miller), from the mountain limestone.\r\n         This is a good example of the structure of the receptacle\r\n         in this group of Crinoideans, which is distinguished by\r\n         the arms passing off at right angles from the periphery\r\n         of the receptacle, like the spokes of a wheel; whence the\r\n         name, Nave Encrinite. The upper part is covered by closely\r\n         adapted plates, and the buccal aperture or mouth is situated\r\n         at the side. The stem of this group is thickly beset with\r\n         side-arms. (Fig. 7 is a very small detached one.) The arms\r\n         are numerous (amounting to thirty in the species figured),\r\n         and of great length; these subdivide into jointed filaments\r\n         of extreme minuteness. Slabs of limestone are often entirely\r\n         covered with them, and many layers are wholly made up of\r\n         their aggregated remains. The plates of the receptacle are\r\n         generally highly ornamented: in one species the sculpturing\r\n         so closely resembles that of the _Marsupites ornatus_ of the\r\n         chalk, that it was with difficulty I convinced Mr. Parkinson\r\n         that the latter did not possess a stem, and therefore was\r\n         not an Actinocrinite.[46]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 46: See Medals of Creation, p. 325; Wonders of Geology, p.\r\n664; Miller's Crinoidea, p. 94.]\r\n\r\n  Figs. 4, & 5.

This species\r\nbelongs to the group in which the rays are elongated, and far exceed\r\nin length the diameter of the disk; in another subdivision (the\r\n_Goniaster_, or Cushion-star), the body is angular, and the lobes\r\nor rays are short, and do not exceed in length the diameter of the\r\nbody. In another group (the _Comatula_, or Feather-star), the rays\r\nare fringed with long jointed tentacula, which divide and subdivide\r\nlike those of the Crinoidea; and these star-fishes may, in fact, be\r\nregarded as free Lily-shaped animals.[48] There is another tribe in\r\nwhich the arms are elongated into slender rays, without grooves or\r\ntentacula; these are called the Serpent Star-fishes (_Ophiura_).\r\nSpecies of all these groups occur in a fossil state.[49]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 47: See Professor Forbes's delightful \"History of the\r\nBritish Star-Fishes.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 48: In the young state the Comatulæ have a jointed\r\nstem, and are attached to other bodies; being in this stage true\r\nCrinoideans.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 49: Medals of Creation, p. 332.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 1. \"Part of a fossil lunated star from the chalk of\r\n         Kent.\"--_Mr. Parkinson._ (_Goniaster semilunata_, of\r\n         Parkinson; _Goniaster Parkinsoni_, of Prof. E. Forbes).\r\n         Remains of Star-fishes are by no means rare in the chalk\r\n         strata of Kent; in those of Sussex they are far less common.\r\n         When the \"Fossils of the South Downs\" was published, in\r\n         1822, a few fragments only had been discovered. Of late\r\n         years, some beautiful examples have been obtained from\r\n         the chalk-pits near Arundel and Worthing, by Mr. Dixon,\r\n         Mr. Coombe, Mrs. Smith, of Tunbridge Wells, and other\r\n         collectors. The cabinet of the Marquess of Northampton is\r\n         very rich in this class of fossils. Several unique examples\r\n         of new species have been obtained from the chalk near\r\n         Maidstone.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. \"An echinite, from France.\"--_Mr. Parkinson._ The\r\n         locality of this fossil is uncertain; no similar specimen\r\n         is known either to Mr. Morris, or the other eminent\r\n         palæontologists I have consulted; and the original cannot be\r\n         discovered. I have reason to believe it was purchased, after\r\n         Mr. Parkinson's death, together with the greater number of\r\n         the fossils already described, by an American gentleman, and\r\n         taken to the United States.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3. \"Part of a stellite or fossil star-fish, resembling\r\n         _Pentagonaster regularis_.\"--_Mr. Parkinson._ This\r\n         well-known chalk species (_Goniaster Mantelli_, of Prof.\r\n         E.

The collection of the Marquess\r\n         of Northampton contains a perfect and exquisite specimen\r\n         attached to a flint, from that locality.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 4. A beautiful example of the Turban Echinite (_Cidaris\r\n         Parkinsoni_, of Dr. Fleming), from Wiltshire.\r\n\r\nThe _Cidaris_, or Turban Echinite, belongs to the family of radiated\r\nanimals, of which the recent Sea-urchin (_Echinus sphæra_) is a\r\nwell-known example. The globular shell or envelope of these animals\r\nis composed of numerous calcareous polygonal plates, arranged in\r\nregular and elegant patterns, like the lines of the meridian on a\r\nglobe. These plates are externally covered with papillæ of various\r\nsizes, to which spines of corresponding magnitude are articulated.\r\nIn some of the _Cidares_ the principal tubercles are very large, and\r\ntheir spines several inches in length. The number and variety of the\r\nanimals of this family that occur in a fossil state are so great,\r\nthat a work expressly devoted to the subject would be required to\r\nthoroughly investigate the characters and relations of the known\r\nspecies. An elementary knowledge of this class of fossil remains may\r\nbe obtained by reference to \"Medals of Creation,\" chap. xi. p. 240.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 5.

It was purchased by Mr. Parkinson for the\r\n         sum of twenty guineas; but this was in the palmy days of\r\n         the study of organic remains, before the terms Geology and\r\n         Palæontology were invented, and when a choice relic of \"a\r\n         former world\" was cheap at any price, in the opinion of the\r\n         enthusiastic collector.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 6.

A fossil shell named Hippurite (_Hippurites bioculatus_,\r\n         of D'Orbigny), from the south of France. This shell belongs\r\n         to a family termed _Rudistes_, whose characters are somewhat\r\n         problematical,--some naturalists referring them to the\r\n         bivalves, and others to the univalves. The Hippurite is\r\n         generally of an elongated conical form, and has internally\r\n         two obtuse longitudinal ridges; the base is sometimes\r\n         partitioned by transverse septa.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 5, is a longitudinal section of a specimen in which septa\r\n         are displayed. The aperture is closed by a moveable\r\n         operculum, or upper valve, as in the specimen fig. 1. The\r\n         substance of the shell is cellular and very thick, and when\r\n         fractured, resembles that of the lamelliferous corals. Some\r\n         kinds attain a large size, and are called \"petrified horns\"\r\n         by the inhabitants of the districts in the Pyrenees where\r\n         they abound. Though Hippurites are abundant in the chalk of\r\n         the south of France, and in Spain and Portugal, none have\r\n         been found in England. The _Spherulite_, a nearly allied\r\n         genus, which has no internal longitudinal ridges, occurs in\r\n         the chalk of Sussex: it was first discovered near Lewes.\r\n         (_Spherulites Mortoni_, of Mantell.)[54]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 54: Medals of Creation, p. 428.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2.

Various kinds of Belemnites.\r\n\r\nIn the \"_Supplementary Notes_\" I have, under the head,\r\n\"_Belemnites_,\" explained somewhat fully the nature of those fossils\r\nwhich, by the name of \"thunderbolts,\" have for so many centuries\r\nexcited the interest and perplexed the ingenuity of collectors of\r\nfossil remains. Referring the reader to that note, I shall therefore\r\nin this place merely give such specific names of the specimens\r\nfigured by Mr. Parkinson as I have been able to determine.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 8. \"A Belemnite of large size,\" Mr. Parkinson. This specimen\r\n         is part of the phragmocone from near the lower apical\r\n         portion, partially invested with the fibrous rostrum or\r\n         guard. It is the species named _Belemnites giganteus_ by M.\r\n         D'Orbigny; from the Oxford clay of Wiltshire.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 9. The guard of a Belemnite, eroded by some Annelide.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 10, is a vertical section of a fragment of a Belemnite,\r\n         showing the alveolus or cavity for the reception of the apex\r\n         of the phragmocone in the upper part.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 11. The distal or apical part of the rostrum or guard of a\r\n         Belemnite. The annexed outline of a transverse section\r\n         exhibits the radiated structure.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 12. The distal part of the guard of a chalk Belemnite\r\n         (_Belemnitella mucronata_); from Norwich. Siliceous casts\r\n         of the phragmocone of _Belemnitella_ are occasionally met\r\n         with in the flints of the South Downs. This phragmocone has\r\n         a longitudinal flat band or ridge, extending down the dorsal\r\n         aspect: the chambers are very numerous; the slit or fissure\r\n         in the ventral aspect of the guard, is occupied by a thin\r\n         expansion of the phragmocone.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 13. A Belemnite from the great oolite of Stonesfield\r\n         (_Belemnites fusiformis_, of Parkinson). The upper part\r\n         shows the alveolus for the reception of the apex of the\r\n         phragmocone.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 14. A fragment of a guard split vertically, the flat surface\r\n         showing a section of the alveolus filled with spar. This\r\n         specimen belongs to the _Belemnites cylindriformis_, of\r\n         Parkinson.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 15. A Belemnite (_Belemnites coniformis_, of Parkinson),\r\n         having part of the guard broken off, to show the alveolus\r\n         or hollow in which the apical part of the phragmocone is\r\n         received. The removed portion has the cast of the alveolus\r\n         attached to it.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 16, of which fig. 17, is an enlarged view, is a species of\r\n         chambered foraminiferous shell, called _Nodosaria_ (_N.\r\n         raphanistrum_, of Lamarck); from Sienna.

Cast of part of a straight-chambered shell (_Baculites\r\n         Fraujasii_, of Lamarck), in which the septa, or partitions,\r\n         are deeply and regularly sinuated. In fossils of this kind,\r\n         the cast of each chamber is distinct from the others; but\r\n         the series is held together by the flexuosities of the\r\n         septa. From Maestricht.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3. A limestone cast of the chamber of an Ammonite: from\r\n         Bath. The elongated channel in the middle indicates the\r\n         position of the siphuncle.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 4. Fragment of an Ammonite, showing cavities of two\r\n         chambers, and the canal of the siphuncle, partly lined with\r\n         calcareous spar.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 5. Polished sections of an Ammonite (_Ammonites Walcotii_)\r\n         from the Lias, Whitby. The chambers are filled with\r\n         semi-transparent spar. The siphunculus is seen running along\r\n         the dorsal, or outer margins of the volutions. The dark\r\n         appearances observable in several parts of the siphuncle\r\n         result from the carbonization of the animal membrane with\r\n         which the tube was lined in the living state.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 6. \"An _Oval Ammonite_.\"--_Mr. Parkinson._ This is evidently\r\n         the cast of a discoidal shell pressed into an elliptical\r\n         form. In the Chalk-marl, casts of Ammonites, Nautilites, &c.\r\n         are very commonly more or less distorted by compression. The\r\n         marl appears to have remained in a plastic state after the\r\n         decomposition of the shell in which it was moulded, and to\r\n         have admitted of being squeezed into close contact with the\r\n         surrounding matrix; when the stratum became consolidated\r\n         the cast retained its accidental shape, and adhering but\r\n         slightly to the investing marl, was separable by a properly\r\n         directed blow. This explains the otherwise unintelligible\r\n         fact of a cast being closely invested by the rock, and all\r\n         traces of the shell in which it was formed absent. When both\r\n         the cast and the matrix became solid and uncompressible\r\n         before the shell was decomposed, then loose casts were\r\n         formed; as is common in the Portland stone, &c. The fossil\r\n         figured appears to be an indifferent example of a common\r\n         chalk-marl species (_Ammonites Mantelli_, of Sowerby).\r\n\r\n  Fig. 7. A beautiful cast of an Ammonite, in which the foliaceous\r\n         septa transmuted into pyrites (sulphuret of iron, or\r\n         _marcasite_), are exquisitely shown.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 8.

Part of the cast of a species of Hamite (_Hamites\r\n         intermedius_, of Sowerby), from the Gait of Folkstone. The\r\n         name _Hamites_ was employed by Mr. Parkinson to designate\r\n         a genus of chambered shells, in which the direction of the\r\n         spire, instead of being straight, as in _Baculites_, or\r\n         discoidal, as in _Ammonites_, was bent like a hook beyond\r\n         the inner reflected part. All the specimens here figured are\r\n         but fragments.[55]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 55: Medals of Creation, vol. ii. p. 500.]\r\n\r\n  Figs. 2, & 5.

Two views of a species of an extinct genus, the\r\n         shells of which, though not chambered, are supposed to have\r\n         been inhabited by Cephalopoda, like the recent Argonaut. The\r\n         specimen (_Bellerophon costatus_, of Sowerby) is from the\r\n         Mountain limestone of Derbyshire.[56]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: Ibid p. 477.]\r\n\r\n  Figs. 8, & 9.

Two specimens of \"_Scaphites_, or Boat-like\r\n         Ammonite,\" of Mr. Parkinson. A remarkable cretaceous genus\r\n         of extinct cephalopoda. The specimens figured are from the\r\n         Lower chalk of Sussex (_Scaphites costatus_, of Mantell; _S.\r\n         equalis_, of Sowerby).\r\n\r\n  Fig. 12. Cast of a spiral chambered shell, called _Turrilite_, of\r\n         which many species occur in the lower cretaceous strata\r\n         (_Turrilites costatus_, of Langius). The quarries of lower\r\n         chalk at St. Catharine's Mount, near Rouen, in Normandy,\r\n         have long been celebrated for the number and perfection of\r\n         specimens of this elegant type of cephalopodous shells.\r\n         The first known English examples of this genus, as well as\r\n         of Scaphites, were discovered by me in the chalk marl, at\r\n         Hamsey, near Lewes, in Sussex, in 1810. Several very fine\r\n         specimens of a large species (_Turrilites tuberculatus_),\r\n         some of which are more than two feet in length, have\r\n         been obtained from the same strata. The tubercles on the\r\n         casts of this species are the bases of strong spines. The\r\n         siphunculus, in the state of a pyritous cast, is preserved\r\n         in some examples.\r\n\r\n  Figs. 13 to 27. These figures all refer to a very curious group of\r\n         fossils, termed _Nummulites_, from the supposed resemblance\r\n         of some of the flat disks to a piece of money. The\r\n         complexity of their internal structure, and the supposed\r\n         resemblance of their organization to that of the true\r\n         Cephalopoda, led to many erroneous opinions as to the\r\n         nature of the originals. That eminent physiologist, Dr.\r\n         W. B. Carpenter, has recently investigated the intimate\r\n         structure of the whole group, and the results are given in\r\n         a beautiful and masterly memoir in the Quarterly Journal\r\n         of the Geological Society of London.[57] Dr. Carpenter\r\n         has clearly shown that these fossils belong to the\r\n         _Foraminifera_, and not, as some eminent naturalists have\r\n         supposed, to the _Bryozoa_, or \"_Moss-corals_.\" As the\r\n         family to which they belong comprises a numerous assemblage\r\n         of minute organic remains, many of which are delineated in\r\n         the next plate (Plate LXII.), the reader is referred to\r\n         the \"_Supplementary Notes_,\" for a general description of\r\n         the _Foraminifera_, in which is given a restored figure\r\n         of the supposed living animal of the Nummulite, from Dr.\r\n         Carpenter's memoir.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 57: No. 21, for February 1850. \"On the Microscopic\r\nStructure of Nummulina, Orbitolites and Orbitoides.\"]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 13.

These fossils\r\n         occur by myriads in many of the fresh-water secondary and\r\n         tertiary limestones, as well as in the calcareous deposits\r\n         now in progress of formation in our lakes. In the lacustrine\r\n         limestones of the Isle of Wight (at Binstead, White Cliff,\r\n         &c.), beautiful specimens may be obtained.[60] Professor E.\r\n         Forbes has discovered Gyrogonites in the Wealden strata of\r\n         the Isle of Purbeck, associated with shells of the genera\r\n         _Planorbis_, _Physa_, _Paluolina_, &c.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: See Geological Excursions round the Isle of Wight. 2d\r\nEdit. 1850, p. 108.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 25. _Polystomella crispa_, of Linnæus.

The shells in these\r\n         deposits comprise almost all the genera and species that now\r\n         inhabit the Mediterranean. They occur in the most beautiful\r\n         state, deprived only of their colour; and groups are often\r\n         met with of extreme elegance.

A fossil Oyster (_Ostrea Marshii_, of Sowerby), from the\r\n         Cornbrash of the Oolite, Wiltshire.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. The fossil Cockscomb Oyster, (_Ostrea carinata_, of\r\n         Lamarck,) from the Lower chalk, Havre, France.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3. The elegant fossil shell here figured is a peculiar and\r\n         most abundant species in the Lias formation; specimens\r\n         are not uncommon, in which every part of the shell is as\r\n         perfect as if just thrown up on the sea-shore. It belongs\r\n         to the genus Gryphites (_Gryphea incurva_, of Sowerby,)\r\n         the shells of which are nearly related to the oysters, but\r\n         are distinguished by the deep concave under-valve, and its\r\n         curved beak, and the almost flat upper shell. The testaceous\r\n         substance is of a finer laminated structure than in the\r\n         Ostrea, and the hinge-ligament is inserted in an elongated\r\n         curved groove.[61]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Medals of Creation, vol. i. p. 387.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 4. \"_Ostrea vel frons folium._\"--_Mr. Parkinson._ This\r\n         species appears to be the _Ostrea gregarea_ (?) of Sowerby,\r\n         which occurs in the chlorite marl or firestone of the Lower\r\n         chalk in Sussex and Kent.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 5. The fossil is the cast of an oyster-like bivalve, called\r\n         Perna, (_Perna quadrata_, of Sowerby,) which is easily\r\n         recognisable, even in casts, by the line of distinct\r\n         teeth which compose the hinge. This species is abundant\r\n         in the Portland limestone, particularly in the quarries\r\n         around Swindon, in Wiltshire; but from the close adhesion\r\n         of the outer surface of the shell to the surrounding\r\n         stone, they can seldom be extracted, the casts only being\r\n         readily obtainable. In the Kimmeridge clay, which lies\r\n         above the Portland rock, the shells may be met with in\r\n         great perfection. The best locality is near Hartwell, in\r\n         Buckinghamshire, where the clay is extensively dug for the\r\n         brick manufactures.\r\n\r\n  Figs. 6, & 7.

A species of _Radiolites_ (_R. agariciformis_, of M.\r\n         D'Orbigny), from the Cretaceous strata of France. This genus\r\n         is only known in a fossil state; it belongs to the same\r\n         group of shells (order, _Rudistes_) as the Spherulites and\r\n         Hippurites: the lower valve is conical, and much larger than\r\n         the upper, which is slightly convex; it is deeply channelled\r\n         longitudinally.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2. Smooth valve of a species of Corbula (_Corbula gallica_,\r\n         of Lamarck); abundant in some of the Eocene deposits of the\r\n         Paris basin.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 3. A single valve; the inner surface is shown in the figure,\r\n         of a remarkable genus of shells (_Crania personata_, of\r\n         Lamarck), frequently occurring attached to Echinites and\r\n         other bodies of the white chalk.\r\n\r\n  Fig. 4. A species of _Terebratula_ (_T. diphya_, of Lamarck).\r\n         The shells of this genus belong to that division of\r\n         mollusks termed _Brachiopoda_ (arm-feet), from their having\r\n         internally two spiral fleshy arms developed from the sides\r\n         of the alimentary orifice. These organs are supported by\r\n         shelly processes, curiously modified in different genera,\r\n         which often occur in a fossil state. Although the fossil\r\n         Terebratulæ are very numerous, the recent species are but\r\n         few, and are inhabitants of the seas off Australia. They\r\n         form two natural groups; in the one the shells are smooth,\r\n         but perforated all over with minute openings or foramina;\r\n         and these are often filled with a dark substance, which is\r\n         the carbonized soft parts: in the other division the shells\r\n         are plicated or furrowed, and are not foraminiferous.[62]\r\n         The Spirifers, another group of Brachiopoda, have a pair of\r\n         internal spiral appendages.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: On the structure of shells the reader should consult\r\nthe admirable papers of Dr. Carpenter, in the British Association\r\nReports.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 5. _Terebratula coarctata_, of Parkinson.

A plaster model of a skeleton, restored\r\n         from the remains of various individuals, dispersed in\r\n         different collections, is just completed, and exhibited to\r\n         the public in the Gallery of Organic Remains of the British\r\n         Museum.[77] This extinct animal is named the _Megatherium_\r\n         (_gigantic wild animal_) _Cuvieri_. It was seven feet\r\n         high, and nine long, and therefore larger than the largest\r\n         rhinoceros. It possessed no incisor teeth; and the grinders,\r\n         which are seven inches long, are of a prismatic form,\r\n         and like those of the sloths, are composed of dentine\r\n         and cement. They are so formed that the crown always\r\n         presents two cutting, wedge-shaped, salient angles; they\r\n         are therefore admirably adapted for cutting and bruising\r\n         vegetable substances. The entire fore-foot is about a yard\r\n         in length, and armed with strong claws. The Megatherium held\r\n         an intermediate place between the sloths, armadillos, and\r\n         ant-eaters. The celebrated specimens of different parts of\r\n         the skeleton of this colossal creature, preserved in the\r\n         Hunterian Museum of the College of Surgeons of England, were\r\n         collected and presented by Sir Woodbine Parish.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: See Wonders of Geology, pp. 164-167.]\r\n\r\n  Fig. 2.

From a perfect skeleton\r\nlately set up in the British Museum (in the same room with that of\r\nthe Megatherium), a correct idea may be obtained of this peculiar\r\ntype of mammalian structure. From this specimen it appears that\r\nthe great Mastodon of the Ohio was not unlike the elephant In its\r\ngeneral outline, though somewhat longer and thicker. It had a trunk\r\nor proboscis, tusks which curved upward, and four molar teeth in each\r\njaw, but no incisors. But another remarkable peculiarity, and which\r\nentirely separates the Mastodon from the Elephant, is that the young\r\nanimal had a pair of tusks, placed horizontally in the lower jaw, and\r\nof these tusks one only became developed, and that in the adult male:\r\nboth were early shed in the female. In the midst of a collection of\r\nMastodon bones imbedded in mud, a mass of small branches, grass, and\r\nleaves, in a half bruised state, and a species of reed common in\r\nVirginia, were discovered; the whole appeared to have been enveloped\r\nin a sac, probably the stomach of the animal. In another instance\r\ntraces of the proboscis were observed. The tusks are composed of\r\nivory, and vary somewhat in the direction and degree of their\r\ncurvature. The bones of this colossal quadruped are found remarkably\r\nfresh and well preserved, and are generally impregnated with iron. No\r\nliving instance of this creature is on record, and there can be no\r\ndoubt that its race has long since been extinct.\r\n\r\n\"Big-bone Lick, where so many remains of the Mastodon and other\r\nextinct quadrupeds have been dug up, is distant from Cincinnati\r\nabout twenty-three miles in a south-west direction. This celebrated\r\nbog is situated in a nearly level plain, in a valley bounded by\r\ngentle slopes, which lead up to flat table-lands composed of blue\r\nargillaceous (Silurian) limestone, and marl. The general course of\r\nthe meandering stream which flows through the plain, is from east to\r\nwest. There are two springs on the southern or left bank, rising from\r\nmarshes, and two on the opposite bank; the most western of which,\r\ncalled the Gum Lick, is at the point where a small tributary joins\r\nthe principal stream. The quaking bogs on this side are now more than\r\nfifteen acres in extent; but all the marshes were formerly larger,\r\nbefore the surrounding forest was partially cleared away. Within the\r\nmemory of persons now living, the wild bisons or buffaloes crowded\r\nto these springs; but they have retreated many years, and are now as\r\nunknown to the inhabitants as the Mastodon itself. The bog in the\r\nspots where the salt springs rise is so soft, that a pole may be\r\nforced down into it many yards perpendicularly.\r\n\r\n\"The greater numbers both of the entire skeletons and the separate\r\nbones have been taken up from black mud, about twelve feet below\r\nthe level of the Creek. It is supposed that the bones of the\r\nmastodons found here could not have belonged to less than one hundred\r\nindividuals: those of the fossil Elephant (_Elephas primigenius_) to\r\ntwenty; besides which a few bones of the Megalonyx, and of a species\r\nof stag, horse, and bison, are stated to have been collected. The\r\ngreatest depth of the black mud has not been ascertained; it is\r\ncomposed chiefly of clay, with a mixture of calcareous matter and\r\nsand, and contains 5 parts in 100 of sulphate of lime, with some\r\nanimal matter. Layers of gravel occur in the midst of it at various\r\ndepths. It contains remains of seeds, and of several species and\r\ngenera of fresh-water and terrestrial shells. It is impossible to\r\nview this plain without at once concluding that it has remained\r\nunchanged in all its principal features, from the period when\r\nthe extinct quadrupeds inhabited the banks of the Ohio and its\r\ntributaries.\r\n\r\n\"There are two buffalo paths or trails still extant in the woods,\r\nand both lead directly to springs: the one which strikes off in a\r\nnortherly direction from the Gum Lick, may be traced eastward through\r\nthe forest for several miles. It is three or four yards wide, and\r\nonly partially overgrown with grass, and sixty years ago was as bare,\r\nhard, and well trodden, as a high road. It is well known that during\r\ngreat droughts in the Pampas of South America, the horses, deer,\r\nand cattle, throng to the rivers in such numbers, that the foremost\r\nof the crowd are pushed into the stream by the pressure of others\r\nbehind, and are sometimes carried away by thousands, and drowned. In\r\ntheir eagerness to drink the saline waters and lick the salt, the\r\nheavy mastodons and elephants seem in like manner to have pressed\r\nupon each other, and sunk in the soft quagmires of Kentucky.\"[79]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: Extracted from Sir Charles Lyell's \"Travels in North\r\nAmerica,\" vol. ii. chap. xvii. 1845.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLEMENTARY NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. Fossil Bears of the Caverns. (Plate LXXIII.) For many centuries\r\ncertain caves in Germany have been celebrated for their osseous\r\ntreasures, particularly those in Franconia. The most remarkable of\r\nthese caverns is that of Gaylenreuth, which lies to the north-west\r\nof the village of that name, on the left bank of the river Wiesent,\r\non the confines of Bayreuth.[80] The entrance to this cave is in the\r\nface of a perpendicular rock, and leads to a series of chambers from\r\nfifteen to twenty feet high, and several hundred feet in extent,\r\nterminating in a deep chasm. The cave is quite dark; and the icicles\r\nand pillars of stalactite, reflected by the light of the torches,\r\nwhich it is necessary to use, present a highly picturesque effect.\r\nThe floor is literally paved with bones and fossil teeth, and the\r\npillars and corbels of stalactite also contain similar remains. The\r\nbones are generally scattered and broken, but not rolled; they are\r\nlighter and less solid than recent bones, and are often incrusted\r\nwith stalactites. Three-fourths of the bones belong to two species\r\nof bears (_Ursus_), the remainder to hyænas, tigers, wolves, foxes,\r\ngluttons, weasels, and other small carnivora. Those belonging to\r\nbears are referable to two extinct species: the largest has the skull\r\nmore prominent on the front than any living species; it is named\r\n_Ursus spelæus_, or cavern bear; the other has a flat forehead,\r\nand is the _Ursus priscus_ of Cuvier. The Hyena was allied to the\r\nspotted hyena of the Cape, but differed in the form of the teeth and\r\nskull. Bones of the Elephant and Rhinoceros are said to have been\r\ndiscovered, together with those of existing animals, and fragments of\r\nsepulchral urns of high antiquity.[81]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: See Medals of Creation, vol. ii. p. 869, for an\r\ninteresting account of the present state of these caverns, by my\r\nfriend. Major Willoughby Montague.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: Dr. Buckland's \"Reliquia Diluviana\" contains a full\r\naccount of the most remarkable ossiferous caverns and their contents.]\r\n\r\nSimilar ossiferous caves occur in England; of these, the most\r\nremarkable now accessible are Kent's Hole, near Torquay, and Banwell\r\nCave, in the Mendip Hills, near the village of Banwell. The latter\r\nmay be easily visited, as the Exeter railway passes within three\r\nmiles of the village, and there is a station, with vehicles to convey\r\npassengers to Banwell.\r\n\r\nII. The Belemnite. (Plates LIX. and LX.) Among the innumerable relics\r\nwhich abound in the secondary deposits, there are perhaps no fossil\r\nbodies that have excited so much curiosity, or given rise to so many\r\nfanciful conjectures as to their nature and origin, as the long,\r\ncylindrical, fusiform, crystalline stones, called _Belemnites_ by\r\nnaturalists, and _thunderbolts_ by common observers. Mr. Parkinson\r\ngives an amusing account (vol. iii. p. 122) of the discordant\r\nopinions entertained at various times respecting the nature of these\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nIt would be irrelevant to dwell on the history of the successive\r\nattempts that have been made to elucidate the origin and structure\r\nof the Belemnite. It will suffice to describe concisely the present\r\nstate of our knowledge as to the organization of the original.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller, in 1823,[82] showed that the Belemnite was the rostrum\r\nor osselet of an animal allied to the Sepia, or Cuttle-fish, and\r\ngave a restored outline of the supposed form of the original, with\r\nthe Belemnite in its presumed natural situation. Dr. Buckland and M.\r\nAgassiz imagined that they had traced a natural connexion between\r\ncertain species of Belemnites that abound in the Lias, and the ink\r\nbag and other soft parts of the Sepiæ or Calamaries found associated\r\nwith them; and they suggested the name of _Belemno-sepia_ for the\r\nsupposed animal of the Belemnite,[83]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: Geological Transactions, New Series, vol. ii.; and Dr.\r\nBuckland's Bridgewater Essay.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: Bridgewater Essay, p. 374.]\r\n\r\nIn 1842, the late Mr. Channing Pearce described, under the name\r\nof _Belemnoteuthis antiquus_, a naked (destitute of a shell,)\r\ncephalopod, which occurs in immense numbers in certain beds of the\r\nOxford clay, especially at Christian Malford, in Wiltshire. This\r\nanimal has at the lower apical part a conical osselet of a horny\r\nsubstance, and fibrous structure, enclosing a chambered siphunculated\r\nshell, which becomes gradually thinner at the upper part, and forms\r\na cup-like receptacle, in which is placed the ink-bag. The soft body\r\nof an elongated oval form, with a pair of lateral palleal fins, two\r\nlarge sessile eyes, and with eight uncinated arms and a pair of long\r\ntentacula, are preserved in a more or less distinct and perfect state\r\nin several specimens that have lately been discovered. Mr. Channing\r\nPearce, Mr. Cunnington, and other collectors of these interesting\r\nremains, were convinced that this cephalopod was entirely distinct\r\nfrom the animal to which the Belemnite belonged.\r\n\r\nIn 1844, Professor Owen laid before the Royal Society \"A description\r\nof certain Belemnites preserved with a great proportion of their soft\r\nparts in the Oxford clay, at Christian Malford, Wilts.\"[84] In this\r\nmemoir (for which one of the royal medals of the Society was awarded)\r\nthe author describes as the soft parts of the Belemnite the remains\r\nof the animal which Mr. Channing Pearce had two years previously\r\nshown to belong to a different genus (_Belemnoteuthis_). Belying on\r\nthe correctness of Professor Owen's views, I gave an abstract of this\r\nmemoir in my \"_Medals of Creation_,\" and stated that belemnites had\r\nbeen discovered with the osselet, receptacle, and ink-bag, in their\r\nnatural position, and with remains of the mantle, body, fins, eyes,\r\nand the tentacula, with their horny rings and hooks.[85]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: Philos. Trans. Part I. 1844. p. 65.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: Medals of Creation, vol. ii. p. 467.]\r\n\r\nThe discovery by my son (Mr. Reginald Neville Mantell) of some\r\nremarkably perfect specimens of belemnites in the Oxford clay,\r\nexposed in the railway works on which he was engaged, near\r\nTrowbridge, in Wilts, led me to examine the structure of the\r\nBelemnoteuthis with more attention than I had hitherto done, as well\r\nas the evidence adduced by Professor Owen in proof that the fossil\r\nosselet, the Belemnite, belonged to the same genus of cephalopoda. I\r\nfound that _no specimen had been obtained in which the phragmocone,\r\nor terminal chambered part of the Belemnoteuthis_ (of Pearce),\r\n_was situated in the alveolus of a Belemnite_; but Professor Owen\r\nhaving assumed that the osselet of the former must have originally\r\nbeen protected by a rostrum, or guard, described the soft parts\r\nas belonging to the animal of the Belemnite, conceiving that the\r\nphragmocone of the Belemnoteuthis was that of a Belemnite that had\r\nslipped out of the guard.\r\n\r\nIn a communication to the Royal Society, in 1848, I demonstrated\r\nhow utterly at variance with the facts were these conclusions, and\r\npointed out the essential distinctive characters that separated the\r\ntwo extinct genera, so far as the specimens then discovered would\r\nwarrant.[86] Other illustrative examples of the Belemnite have since\r\nbeen obtained; and in a supplementary paper read before the Royal\r\nSociety, February 14th, of the present year (1850), I have stated\r\nwhat appears to me to be the extent of our present knowledge of the\r\norganization of the Belemnite. I subjoin an abstract of that paper,\r\nwhich embodies the result of an examination of many hundred specimens\r\nof Belemnites and Belemnoteuthites. The annexed outline, or diagram,\r\nshows the known structures of the Belemnite; of the soft parts of\r\nthe animal, a few imperfect carbonaceous traces, apparently of the\r\nmantle, around and between the shelly processes of the upper part of\r\nthe phragmocone, are the only vestiges I have been able to detect.\r\nThe most perfect Belemnite hitherto discovered consists of,\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: Philos. Trans. 1848, p. 171.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n1. An external _Capsule_ (_e_) which invested the osselet or\r\nsepiostaire, and extending upwards, constituted the external sheath\r\nof the receptacle.\r\n\r\n2. The _Osselet_, characterized by its fibrous radiated structure,\r\nterminating distally in a solid rostrum or guard (_i_), having an\r\nalveolus, or conical hollow (_g_), to receive the apical portion of\r\nthe chambered phragmocone, and expanding proximally into a thin cup,\r\nwhich became confluent with the capsule, and formed the receptacle\r\n(_b, b_,) for the viscera.\r\n\r\n3. The _Phragmocone_ (_d_), or chambered, siphunculated (_c_),\r\ninternal shell; the apex of which occupied the alveolus (_g_) of\r\nthe guard, and the upper part constituted a capacious chamber, from\r\nthe basilar margin of which proceeded two long, flat, testaceous,\r\nprocesses (_a, a_,).\r\n\r\nThese structures comprise all that are at present known of the animal\r\nto which the fossil commonly called \"_Belemnite_,\" belonged.\r\n\r\nOf the _Belemnoteuthis_, the cephalopod which Professor Owen\r\nconsiders to be a Belemnite, many examples of the body with eight\r\nuncinated arms and a pair of long tentacula, and with an ink-bag, and\r\npalleal fins, have been discovered. The osselet of this animal, like\r\nthat of the Belemnite, has a fibro-radiated structure, investing a\r\nconical chambered shell; but this organ, for reasons fully detailed\r\nin the memoir, could never have been contained within the alveolus of\r\na Belemnite.\r\n\r\nNo _certain_ evidence has been obtained of the occurrence of an\r\n_ink-bag_ in natural connexion with a Belemnite.\r\n\r\nDiagram of the known Structures of the _Belemnites Puzosianus_, from\r\nTrowbridge.\r\n\r\n  _a, a_, dorsal processes.\r\n\r\n  _b, b_, the receptacle.\r\n\r\n  _c, c_, the siphuncle.\r\n\r\n  _d, d_, the phragmocone.\r\n\r\n  _e_, the capsule.\r\n\r\n  _f_, the inferior end of the phragmocone.\r\n\r\n  _g_, the alveolus of the guard.\r\n\r\n  _h_, vertical section of the guard.\r\n\r\n  _i_, the guard, or rostrum of the osselet.\r\n\r\n  _k_, sulcus, or furrow, on the ventral aspect of this species of\r\n         Belemnite.\r\n\r\n  _l_, capsule, or periostricum.\r\n\r\n  _m_, the dorsal line.\r\n\r\n  _n_, transverse section, showing the fibrous radiated structure of\r\n         the guard.\r\n\r\nIn the annexed outline the several parts are represented in their\r\nnatural relative positions. The capsule, or most external investment,\r\n(_e_) is seen only in section, being removed to expose the rostrum\r\nor guard (the fossil body generally known as the Belemnite). The\r\nupper three-fourths of the rostrum are also taken away, to show the\r\nphragmocone which it originally enveloped. The straight transverse\r\nlines denote the chambers of the phragmocone; the latter is seen\r\nextending downwards till it terminates in a point or apex; that part\r\nof the cavity in the guard is called the _alveolus_. The _siphuncle_,\r\nor tube which extends through the entire series of chambers, and is\r\nsituated on the ventral margin, is indicated at _c, c_. The dorsal\r\nprocesses (_a, a_) are seen on their inner aspect at the upper part;\r\nthe diverging lines (_m_) between them indicate the impressions of\r\nthe soft parts, of which some traces remain.\r\n\r\nIII. Fossil Remains of Birds.--_The Moa, or Dinornis of New\r\nZealand._ The bones of birds are of extreme rarity in a fossil\r\nstate. Throughout the immense series of the palæozoic and secondary\r\nformations--the accumulated sedimentary deposits of innumerable\r\nages--no unquestionable indications of the existence of this class of\r\nhighly organized beings have been brought to light.\r\n\r\nIn the Triassic, or New Red argillaceous sandstones of the valley\r\nof the Connecticut River, in North America, some very remarkable\r\nphenomena have, however, been discovered, and which in the opinions\r\nof many eminent observers render it highly probable, that at the\r\nperiod when these strata were deposited, numerous birds, some of\r\ncolossal magnitude, abounded on the then dry land. When slabs of\r\nthese sandstones are split asunder, or exposed, so as to exhibit\r\nthe sedimentary surface which separates one layer from another,\r\nthe foot-prints of many species of bipeds are perceived deeply\r\nimpressed on the stone, and disposed in such manner as to prove that\r\nthey are the tracks of animals that walked over the surface of the\r\ndeposit when it was in a soft or plastic state. The close analogy of\r\nthese imprints to those of birds' feet, not only in their general\r\nresemblance, but also in the disposition of the tracks, and in the\r\nrelation of the distance of the stride, and the depth and shallowness\r\nof the impressions, to the size of the respective feet, tends to\r\ncorroborate the inference first enunciated by Professor Hitchcock,\r\nand subsequently confirmed by other geologists, that these mysterious\r\nmarkings on the rock, are natural records of the existence of various\r\ntribes of birds during the Triassic period;[87] but unfortunately the\r\nonly certain evidence of the correctness of this opinion--remains of\r\nthe skeletons--is wanting; not a vestige of a vertebrated animal of a\r\nhigher class than fishes and reptiles has been discovered.[88]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: Travels in North America, vol. ii. pl. 7.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: See Wonders of Geology, vol. ii. p. 556.\r\nOrnithichnites, or Fossil Footprints of Birds; Medals of Creation,\r\nvol. i. p. 808.]\r\n\r\nIn the vast fluviatile formation--the Wealden--of the south-east\r\nof England, which abounds in the remains of terrestrial plants and\r\nreptiles, many fragments of bones of such tenuity as to indicate that\r\nthey belonged to animals capable of flight, have from time to time\r\nbeen collected since my first discovery and announcement, in 1822, of\r\nsupposed birds' bones in the strata of Tilgate Forest. Some of these\r\nrelics were declared by Baron Cuvier, and subsequently by Professor\r\nOwen, to be unquestionably those of birds; probably some species of\r\nwaders. But recent observations have rendered it doubtful whether\r\nall the specimens of this class from the Wealden, like those from\r\nStonesfield, are not to be regarded as referable to flying reptiles\r\n(Pterodactyles).[89]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 89: Wonders of Geology, vol. i. p. 438, 440. I still think\r\nit probable, however, that bones of birds will be detected among the\r\nWealden fossils.]\r\n\r\nIn the chalk of Kent several bones of a very large flying animal\r\nhave been obtained from a quarry at Burham, near Maidstone; some of\r\nthese are figured and described in Professor Owen's beautiful work\r\non British Fossil Mammals and Birds, as those of a bird allied to\r\nthe Albatross; but the occurrence in the same quarry of jaws with\r\nteeth, and other undoubted remains of a gigantic Pterodactyle,[90]\r\nand the absence in the specimens figured of osteological characters\r\nexclusively ornithic, seem to support the conclusion that these also\r\nmust be ascribed to flying reptiles.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 90: These fossils are in the splendid museum of J. S.\r\nBowerbank, Esq. of Highbury Grove, Islington.]\r\n\r\nIn the most ancient tertiary strata unquestionable vestiges of birds\r\noccur; in the Sub-Himalaya eocene deposits, they are associated with\r\nbones of the extinct elephantine mammalia of India; in those of the\r\nParis basin with the remains of the Palæotheria, &c. In the miocene\r\nand pliocene formations, the bones and even egg-shells of several\r\nspecies and genera have been detected. The remains of birds, however,\r\neven in comparatively recent deposits, were of such rare occurrence\r\nas to be ranked by the collector of fossils among the most precious\r\nof his acquisitions; but a few years ago, a most extraordinary\r\ndiscovery in our Antipodean colony. New Zealand, astonished and\r\ndelighted the palæontologist, by placing before him hundreds of bones\r\nof numerous extinct genera of birds, some of which far exceed in\r\nmagnitude those of the most gigantic living species, the Ostrich.\r\n\r\nIn various localities of the maritime districts of New Zealand,\r\nthere had been observed in the beds of rivers and streams, fossil\r\nbones of birds of colossal magnitude, belonging to many species and\r\nseveral genera, associated with similar relics of smaller species.\r\nThese bones had attracted the attention of the natives long ere the\r\ncountry was visited by Europeans; and traditions are rife among the\r\nNew Zealanders that this race formerly existed in great numbers, and\r\nserved as food to their remote ancestors. They also believe that some\r\nof the largest species have been seen alive within the memory of man;\r\nand even affirm that individuals still exist in the unfrequented and\r\ninaccessible parts of the interior of the country. They call the bird\r\n_Moa_, and state that its head and tail were adorned with magnificent\r\nplumes of feathers, which were worn by their ancient chiefs as\r\nornaments of distinction.\r\n\r\nNine years since, a fragment of a thigh-bone of a bird larger than\r\nthat of the Ostrich was brought to England by Mr. Rule, and submitted\r\nto the examination of Professor Owen, who pronounced it to belong\r\nto a gigantic bird of the _Struthious_ (Ostrich) order. A few years\r\nafterwards several collections of vertebræ, bones of the extremities,\r\n&c. were transmitted to England by Messrs. Williams, Wakefield,\r\nEarle, &c., which corroborated that opinion, and proved that there\r\nformerly existed in the islands of New Zealand, colossal birds of a\r\ntype distinct from any known in other parts of the world. In 1846\r\nand 1847, my eldest son, Mr. Walter Mantell, who has resided in New\r\nZealand several years, made an extensive and highly interesting\r\ncollection of these fossil remains, which arrived in England in 1848.\r\nThis series contains _skulls_, with the _mandibles or beaks_, bones\r\nof other parts of the skeleton, and _portions of the egg-shells_, of\r\nseveral extinct species and genera of birds; presenting remarkable\r\ndeviations from the previously known types to which they are most\r\nnearly allied.\r\n\r\nThis valuable accession to our knowledge of the osteology of this\r\nextinct race of Ostrich-like birds--some individuals of which must\r\nhave attained a height of from ten to twelve feet--has yielded\r\nimportant results as to the form, structure, and economy, of these\r\ncolossal bipeds, and the prevailing characters of the terrestrial\r\nfauna of New Zealand in very remote periods. The collection,\r\nconsisting of above 700 specimens, is now in the British Museum: it\r\nwas obtained chiefly from a bed of _menaccanite_ or titaniferous\r\niron-sand, that had evidently been washed down by torrents from\r\nthe volcanic region of Mount Egmont; that snow-capped ridge which\r\nforms so striking a feature in the physical geography of the North\r\nIsland, and is the source of the fresh-water streams that discharge\r\nthemselves into the ocean along the western shore. The tract of sand\r\nfrom which my son dug up these relics, is on the coast near the\r\nembouchure of a small river called Waingongoro, between Wanganui\r\nand Waimate. That stream evidently once flowed into the sea far\r\nfrom its present course, for lines of cliffs extend inland from\r\nthe now dry sand-spit, and bear marks of the erosive action of\r\ncurrents.[91] A few months since, I received from my son another\r\nmost interesting collection of fossil bones (comprising above 500\r\nspecimens), chiefly obtained from the eastern shores of the Middle\r\nIsland of New Zealand, when engaged as Government Commissioner for\r\nthe settlement of native claims. These were dug up from a morass of\r\nsmall extent, lying in a little creek or bay at Waikouaiti, some\r\ntwenty miles north of Otago. This swamp, which is only visible at low\r\nwater, is composed of vegetable fibres (apparently of the _Phormium\r\ntenax_), sand, and animal matter. The bones are of a deep brown\r\ncolour, and almost as fresh as if recently taken from a tar-pit.\r\nAmong the specimens are crania and mandibles, and bones of enormous\r\nsize. The most remarkable are _the entire series of phalangeals, and\r\nthe two tarso-metatarsals_, (26 in number,) _of the right and left\r\nfoot of the same individual bird_ (_Dinornis robustus_), which were\r\nfound standing erect, one a yard in advance of the other; as if the\r\nbird had sunk into the mire, and unable to extricate itself, had\r\nperished on the spot. These bones were carefully exhumed and numbered\r\nseriatim, and are the only instances of the bones of the foot and\r\nmetatarsus found in natural connexion; they are, consequently, the\r\nfirst certain examples known of the structure of the feet of the\r\ncolossal birds of New Zealand. The foot of the Moa, to which these\r\nbones belonged, must have been 16 inches long, and 18 inches wide;\r\nand the height of the bird about ten feet. (_See the Frontispiece._)\r\n\r\n[Footnote 91: I must refer for details to the Quarterly Journal of\r\nthe Geological Society, No. XV. August 1848.]\r\n\r\nIt would extend this article far beyond the limits assigned to this\r\nwork, were I to attempt even a cursory account of all the facts and\r\ninferences connected with these discoveries. The anatomical and\r\nphysiological characters of many species and genera will be found in\r\nthe admirable Memoirs on the _Dinornis_, _Palapteryx_, _Notornis_,\r\n&c. by Prof. Owen, in the Transactions of the Zoological Society.[92]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 92: I regret to state that the egg-shells, and many\r\nhighly interesting bones, belonging to unknown genera of birds,\r\nfrom Rangatapu or Waingongoro, in my son's first collection, remain\r\nundescribed. My notes and observations on the geological position of\r\nthe ossiferous deposits of the North Island of New Zealand, derived\r\nfrom the sketches and letters of Mr. Walter Mantell, are published in\r\nthe Geological Journal; those on his collection of fossils from the\r\nMiddle Island will appear in the same publication in the course of\r\nthe present year (1850).]\r\n\r\nFrom the facts at present known as to the position of the ossiferous\r\ndeposits of New Zealand, there is reason to conclude that they\r\nbear the same relation to the present state of the country, as the\r\nalluvial loam and clay containing the bones of mammoths, Irish\r\nElks, &c. to that of Great Britain. I think we may safely infer\r\nthat at a period geologically recent, but historically very remote,\r\nthose islands were densely peopled by tribes of ostrich-like birds\r\nof species and genera which have long since become extinct; that\r\nmany species existed contemporary with the Maories or native human\r\ninhabitants, and that the last of the family were exterminated, like\r\nthe Irish Elk, and the Dodo, by man. If, as the natives affirm,\r\nsome of the race still exist in the unfrequented parts of the\r\ncountry, they are probably diminutive species, like the Apteryx\r\nor _Kivi-Kivi_, which is the only living representative known to\r\nnaturalists, of this once numerous tribe of colossal Struthionidæ.\r\nThe only fossil osseous remains from New Zealand not referable to\r\nbirds are bones of two species of Seals, and one femur and a few\r\nother bones of a Dog. Associated with the relics of the Dinornis\r\nand other extinct genera, and unquestionably coeval with them, are\r\ncrania, mandibles, and other bones, of the living species of Apteryx,\r\nAlbatross, Penguin, Notornis, Nestor, Water-hen, &c.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of egg-shells of Dinornis, from Rangatapu, belong to\r\nthree distinct types, each of very large size; my son, to convey an\r\nidea of the magnitude of one egg, of which he dug up a large portion,\r\nsays, \"a gentleman's hat would make a capital egg-cup for it.\" The\r\nmarkings on the surface of the shells bear a greater resemblance to\r\nthose on the eggs of the Rhea and Cassowary than of the Ostrich.\r\n\r\nA remarkable fact mentioned by my son throws some light as to the\r\ncomparatively recent extirpation of the Moa. In one spot the natives\r\npointed out some little mounds covered with herbage, as consisting of\r\nheaps of ashes and bones, the refuse of the fires and feasts left by\r\ntheir remote ancestors. Upon digging into them, a quantity of burnt\r\nbones was discovered: these belonged to Man, Moa, and Dog, and were\r\npromiscuously intermingled. These calcined bones present no traces\r\nwhatever either of the earthy powder or manaccanite sand which the\r\ncells and pores of the fossil bones invariably contain. If, as the\r\nnatives affirm, these are the rejectamenta of the feasts of the\r\naborigines, the practice of cannibalism by the New Zealanders must\r\nhave been of very ancient date, and could not have originated, as\r\nProfessor Owen supposed, from the want of animal food in consequence\r\nof the extirpation of the colossal birds. (See _ante_, p. xi.)\r\n\r\nIV. Botanical arrangement of Fossil Vegetables.--Mr. Artis, in the\r\nIntroduction of his work, offers some judicious observations as\r\nto the proper method in which the study of Fossil Botany should\r\nbe pursued. He remarks, \"that from the imperfect state in which\r\nfossil vegetables are generally found, the ordinary characters by\r\nwhich recent plants are referred to their congeners, can scarcely\r\never be detected in them. The sexual organs on which the systems of\r\nLinnæus and Jussieu are founded, and even the integuments of those\r\norgans while in the state of flowering, have uniformly perished. The\r\nexternal parts of the seed or fruit exist, indeed, in a fossil state,\r\nbut they are almost always insulated from the other organs. If leaves\r\nare found, it is almost certain that scarcely any portion of the stem\r\nwill be attached to them; if the external parts of a trunk, then very\r\nrarely any vestiges of the branches and foliage. And when traces\r\nof the internal structure can be discovered, it is seldom that the\r\nexternal character of the stem remains.\r\n\r\n\"In consequence of this deficiency of the essential characters on\r\nwhich the determinations of the botanist are founded, there exists\r\na necessity for examining more minutely and accurately than has yet\r\nbeen done, the internal structure of recent plants; their habits of\r\ngrowth, the cicatrices or scars left on the stem by the leaves that\r\nare spontaneously shed, the different appearances which their fruits\r\nexhibit in their various stages of development--all these points must\r\nbe minutely studied before we can obtain any certainty as to the\r\nidentity of fossil and living species of plants.\r\n\r\n\"It is not by publishing detached and unconnected delineations and\r\ndescriptions of fossil plants, as they occasionally occur, that\r\nthe knowledge of them can be considerably promoted. A systematic\r\narrangement must be formed; and the first step to this is the\r\naccurate determination of the species. _Hoc opus, hic labor est._\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be seen,\" he observes, \"in the course of this work, how\r\neasy it would be to imagine parts of the same specimen to be\r\ndifferent species, when they happen to be broken and dispersed. I can\r\nconfidently assert, that in at least a thousand different specimens\r\nwhich I have had in my possession, not more than a hundred distinct\r\nspecies can be recognised. Furthermore, still fewer indeed can be\r\nreferred to any living species; for it is not the fern-like leaf of\r\na plant, the palm-like cicatrix, or the cane-like joint of a stem,\r\nthat will suffice to identify them with those tribes of the vegetable\r\nkingdom. The whole anatomy of the plant must be studied. The subject\r\nhas, indeed, been begun by Professor Martins, in his comparison\r\nof certain fossil stems of plants with those of the living plants\r\ngrowing in the Brazils, but the study is as yet too new to afford\r\ncertain results. Accordingly, several of that professor's opinions\r\nare at variance with those of M. Adolphe Brongniart, who has also\r\ncompared the recent and fossil vegetables together on this plan.\r\nBut by following up the comparison, which has been so successfully\r\nadopted by Baron Cuvier, in the study of fossil animals,[93] similar\r\nresults may be expected, and a knowledge of the extinct plants be at\r\nlength attained.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 93: Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles.]\r\n\r\nMr. Artis then gives an abstract of the systems of Baron Schlotheim,\r\nCount Sternberg, Professor Martins, and M. Adolphe Brongniart, which\r\nI am Induced to subjoin as a useful record of the state of fossil\r\nbotany twelve years ago:--\r\n\r\n\"The Baron Schlotheim, who published in 1804 the first part of a\r\nFlora der Vorwelt, followed up his researches of this kind by a\r\ncatalogue of his cabinet, under the title of 'Die Petrefactenkunde\r\nauf ihrem jetzigen Standpunkte erläutert,' published in 1820, to\r\nwhich two Appendices have since been added in 1822 and 1823.\r\n\r\n\"The arrangement made by the Baron, so far as regards the vegetable\r\npart of his cabinet, is as follows. His specimens are first divided\r\ninto five Sections, or Orders:--\r\n\r\n1. Dendrolithes, containing the remains of trees, which are\r\nsubdivided into three sub-sections.\r\n\r\nA. _Lithoxylites_, of which no characters are given, but from the\r\nspecimens mentioned by him, he evidently arranges in this place the\r\nwood-stone and wood-opal of the mineralogists.\r\n\r\nB. _Lithanthracites_, in which are placed the bituminized stems, and\r\nother parts of trees.\r\n\r\nC. _Bibliolithes_.--Fossil leaves, mostly of the later formations.\r\n\r\n2. Botanolithes.--Comprising those kinds of fossil plants which\r\ncannot be considered either as trees or shrubs, nor as belonging to\r\nthe plants of the old coal formation.\r\n\r\nAll the specimens belonging to the preceding sections are merely\r\nenumerated, and not distinguished by generic and trivial names, as is\r\nthe case with the following.\r\n\r\nPhytotypolithes.--Fossil plants of the stone-coal formation. These\r\nare divided systematically into genera and species. The genera are as\r\nfollow:--\r\n\r\n  a. _Palmacites_, containing fifteen species.\r\n  b. _Casuarinites_,    \"     five.\r\n  c. _Calamites_,       \"     ten.\r\n  d. _Filicites_,       \"     twenty-three.\r\n  e. _Lycopodiolithes_, \"     five.\r\n  f. _Poacites_,        \"     four.\r\n\r\nIn the whole sixty-two species.\r\n\r\n4. Carpolithes.--Of which he enumerates fifteen species as present in\r\nhis collection. This division is considered as a genus, as is also\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\n5. Anthotypolithes.--The cabinet contains only one species, namely\r\nthe _Anthotypolithes ranunculiformis_.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn 1820, Gaspard Count Sternberg published in German, the first\r\nnumber of a work which has been translated by the Comte de Bray,\r\nunder the title of \"Essai d'un Exposé Geognostico-Botanique de la\r\nFlore du Monde Primitif.\" Of this translation a second and third part\r\nappeared in 1823 and 1824. In these successive numbers the Count\r\nhas communicated the state of his knowledge as it grew up under his\r\nhands, in consequence of his own labours and those of his friend,\r\nBaron Schlotheim. The genera, as they are successively developed in\r\nthe work, are the following:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Lepidodendron._--Stem scaly; the scales leaf-bearing, surrounding\r\n       the stem spirally. In a subsequent number, what are here called\r\n       scales, are denominated scale-like cicatrices.\r\n\r\nThis genus is subdivided in the first number into two sub-genera, but\r\nthis division is not noticed in the additional species quoted in the\r\nsucceeding numbers.\r\n\r\n  _Lepidotæ._--Scales convex.\r\n\r\n  _Alveolariæ._--Scales sub-concave.\r\n\r\n  2. _Variolariæ._--Stem shield-bearing, or warty; shields leaf-bearing,\r\n       surrounding the stem spirally.\r\n\r\n  3. _Calamitæ._--Stem striated, intercepted with sutures at the\r\n       articulations.\r\n\r\n  4. _Syringodendron._--Stem arborescent, in the form of pipes agglutinated\r\n       together, with naked glandules surrounding the stem spirally.\r\n\r\nIn the second number the following genera are given:--\r\n\r\n  5. _Rhytidolepis._--Stem arborescent, streaked longitudinally with\r\n       elevated wrinkles; shields surrounding the stem spirally.\r\n\r\n  6. _Flabellaria._--Leaves part stalked, divided and expanded like a fan.\r\n\r\n  7. _Schlotheimia._--Stem jointed, contracted at the articulation,\r\n       verticillate.\r\n\r\n  8. _Annularia._--Leaves disposed in a whirl, inserted in a proper ring.\r\n\r\n  9. _Nœggerathia._--Stem as thick as a goose-quill; leaves alternate,\r\n       approximate, reverse-ovate, half embracing the stem,\r\n       pectinato-toothed at the top, the remainder of the edge uncut.\r\n\r\n  10. _Osmunda._   } This and the following have no generic characters\r\n  11. _Asplenium._ }   assigned to them, the recent genera being referred\r\n                       to.\r\n\r\n  12. _Rotularia._--Leaves verticillate, expanded in the form of a small\r\n                      wheel.\r\n\r\nThe third number contains the following additional genera:--\r\n\r\n  13. _Lepidolepis._--Scale-like cicatrices truncated at their top.\r\n\r\n  14. _Thuites_, of which he gives no characters, but refers to his\r\n                   figures.\r\n\r\n  15. _Antholites._\r\n\r\n  16. _Carpolites._\r\n\r\n  17. _Conites._--Fossil strobili.\r\n\r\n  18. _Sphenopteris._\r\n\r\n  19. _Polypodiolithus._\r\n\r\n  20. _Myriophyllites._\r\n\r\n  21. _Phyllites._\r\n\r\n  22. _Algacites_, which the French translator, on obtaining the opinion\r\n        of Professor Agardh, has changed into _Sargassum_; that celebrated\r\n        algologist having considered it as identically the same as that\r\n        genus of recent algæ.\r\n\r\nThe genera thus successively established, may be arranged in the\r\nfollowing order:--\r\n\r\n  A. Fossil plants of unknown origin, in which the stem is large, and forms\r\n       the only, or at least the most prominent character; including,\r\n       1. _Lepidodendron_; 2. _Variolaria_; 3. _Calamites_;\r\n       4. _Syringodendron_; 5. _Rhytidolepis_; 13. _Lepidolepis_.\r\n\r\n  B. Fossil plants, of unknown origin, in which the leaves form the\r\n       prominent character; including, 6. _Flabellaria_; 7. _Schlotheimia_;\r\n       8. _Annularia_; 9. _Nœggerathia_; 12. _Rotularia_.\r\n\r\n  C. Fossil parts of unknown plants; including, 15, _Antholites_;\r\n       16. _Carpolites_; 17. _Conites_.\r\n\r\n  D. Fossil plants, or parts of plants referable to living types; including,\r\n       10. _Osmunda_; 11. _Asplenium_; 14. _Thuites_; 18. _Sphenopteris_;\r\n       19. _Polypodiolites_; 20. _Myriophyllites_; 22. Algacites.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn November 1821, Professor Martins read to the Botanical Society of\r\nRatisbon, a paper which was afterwards published in its Memoirs for\r\n1822. This paper was entitled, \"_De Plantis nonnullis Antediluvianis\r\nope specierum inter tropicos viventium illustrandis_;\" in it several\r\nof the species mentioned by Baron Schlotheim and Count Sternberg are\r\nreferred to the orders and genera of recent plants; and the following\r\ngenera are proposed:--\r\n\r\n  1. _Filicites_, analogous to the Arborescent ferns.\r\n\r\n  2. _Palmacites_, analogous to the Palmæ.\r\n\r\n  3. _Bambusites_, analogous to Bambusia, and other arborescent grasses;\r\n       these are the _Calamites_ of other authors.\r\n\r\n  4. _Yuccites_, analogous to the Cuciphoræ, Dracenæ, Pandani, Yuccæ, and\r\n       Velloriæ, of botanical writers.\r\n\r\n  5. _Cactites_, analogous to the Cacti.\r\n\r\n  6. _Euphorbites_, analogous to the Cereiform species of Euphorbia.\r\n\r\n  7. _Lychnophorites_, analogous to _Lychnophora_, a genus of plants found\r\n       by Martius in Brazil, which belongs to the order of the Compositæ,\r\n       and is allied to the _Vernoniæ_ of Linnæus and the _Pollalestæ_ of\r\n       Humboldt.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Adolphe Brongniart has given the following classification\r\nof fossil plants, in his Essay \"_Sur la Classification et la\r\nDistribution de Végétaux Fossiles_\" inserted in the \"Mémoires du\r\nMuséum d'Histoire Naturelle;\" and also printed separately in quarto,\r\nParis, 1822:--\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass I.--Stems whose internal organization is recognisable.\r\n\r\n  1. Exogenites.--Wood formed of regular concentric layers.\r\n\r\n  2. Endogenites.--Wood composed of insulated bundles of vessels, which are\r\n       more numerous towards the circumference than at the centre.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass II.--Stems whose internal organization is no longer distinct,\r\nbut which are characterised by their external form.\r\n\r\n  3. Culmites.--Stem jointed, smooth; a single impression at each\r\n       articulation.[94]\r\n\r\n  4. Calamites.--Stem jointed, regularly striated; impressions rounded,\r\n       small, numerous, forming a ring round each articulation, or\r\n       sometimes wanting.[95]\r\n\r\n  5. Syringodendron.--Stem channelled, not jointed; impressions dot-like\r\n       or linear, arranged in quincunx.[96]\r\n\r\n  6. Sigillaria.--Stem channelled, not jointed; impressions in the form of\r\n       disks, arranged in quincunx.\r\n\r\n  7. Clathraria.--Stem neither channelled, nor jointed; impressions in the\r\n       form of rounded disks, disposed in quincunx.[97]\r\n\r\n  8. Sagenaria.--Stem without joints, or furrows, covered with conical\r\n       rhomboidal tubercles disposed in quincunx, having at their upper\r\n       extremity an impression in the form of a disk.[98]\r\n\r\n  9. Stigmaria.--Stem without joints, or furrows; impressions rounded,\r\n       distant, disposed in quincunx.[99]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 94: These stems appear to M. Brongniart to belong to the\r\narborescent grasses, to _Calamus_ or its allied genera.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 95: M. de Candolle suggested to M. Brongniart that these\r\nstems belong to some plants of the natural order of Equisetaceæ.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 96: M. Brongniart considers these remains to belong to\r\ngenera which are entirely extinct.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 97: M. Brongniart shows in his paper the great agreement\r\nbetween these two genera, and the stems of ferns, in every respect\r\nexcepting magnitude, and considers them as evidently owing their\r\norigin to plants of that natural order rather than to the palms.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 98: The stems of this genus are referable, in the opinion\r\nof M. Brongniart, to those of plants belonging to the family of\r\n_Lycopodiaceæ_, notwithstanding the great difference of size between\r\nthem and those of the recent plants of that natural order.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 99: These stems, M. Brongniart supposes, belong rather to\r\nplants of the natural order of _Aroideæ_, than to the _Euphorbiaceæ_,\r\nor to the Palms to which they have been ascribed by other authors.]\r\n\r\nFOLIAGE.\r\n\r\n  10. Lycopodites.--Leaves linear, or setaceous, without ribs, or traversed\r\n        by a single rib, inserted all round the stem, or in a double row.\r\n\r\nThis genus is subdivided into four sections, as follow:--\r\n\r\n  _a._ Leaves narrow, lanceolate, inserted in a regular manner all round a\r\n         stem having the characters of Sagenaria.\r\n\r\n  _b._ Leaves setaceous, inserted in a double row only; stem not reticulated.\r\n         These he considers as the proper Lycopodites.\r\n\r\n  _c._ Leaves broad, without any apparent ribs, inserted irregularly all\r\n         round the stem. These differ much from the rest of the genus.\r\n\r\n  _d._ Leaves blunt, short, closely applied to the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\nClass III.--11. Filicites.--Frond disposed on a flat surface,\r\nsymmetrical; secondary rib simple, forked, or rarely anastomosing.\r\n\r\nThese are divided Into five sub-genera:--\r\n\r\n  _a._ _Glossopteris._--Frond simple, not jagged, traversed by a single\r\n         mid-rib, without distinct secondary ribs.\r\n\r\n  _b._ _Sphenopteris._--Pinnules wedge-shaped, rounded or lobed at the\r\n         extremity; ribs palmate or radiating from the base of the pinnule.\r\n\r\n  _c._ _Neuropteris._--Pinnules rounded, not lobed, nor adhering to the\r\n         rachis by their base; ribs scarcely visible beyond the base, in\r\n         general very distinct, and two-forked.\r\n\r\n  _d._ _Pecopteris._--Frond pinnatifid; pinnules adherent by their base to\r\n         the rachis, traversed by a mid-rib; secondary ribs pinnate.\r\n\r\n  _e._ _Odontopteris._--Pinnules adhering to the rachis by the whole of their\r\n         base; mid-rib none; secondary ribs running out perpendicularly from\r\n         the rachis.\r\n\r\n  12. Sphœnophyllites.--Leaves verticillate, wedge-shaped, truncate; ribs\r\n        radiating, two-forked.[100]\r\n\r\n  13. Asterophyllites.--Leaves verticillate, with a single rib.[101]\r\n\r\n  14. Fucoides.--Frond not symmetrical, often disposed on a flat surface;\r\n        ribs none, or badly defined.\r\n\r\n  15. Phyllites.--Leaves with ribs well defined, repeatedly divided, or\r\n        anastomosing.[102]\r\n\r\n  16. Poacites.--Leaves linear; ribs parallel.\r\n\r\n  17. Palmacites.--Leaves fan-shape.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 100: M. Brongniart considers these to belong to some\r\nextinct genus of plants, allied to, although perfectly distinct from,\r\nthe recent genus _Marsilea_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 101: These the author thinks are the remains of an extinct\r\ngenus of plants.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 102: The character of the ribs here given belongs\r\nexclusively to leaves of plants of the dicotyledonous tribe; as those\r\nof the next genus _Poacites_ equally restricts them to the other\r\ngreat tribe of monocotyledonous plants.]\r\n\r\n\r\nClass IV. _Organs of fructification._\r\n\r\nOrder I. Carpolithes.--Fruits or seeds.\r\n\r\nOrder II. Antholithes.--Flowers.[103]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 103: These orders are too little known to be divided at\r\npresent into genera.]\r\n\r\nThe numerous additions and modifications, which subsequent experience\r\nand discoveries have led M. Brongniart to introduce into his\r\nclassification, will be found in an article recently published (1849)\r\nin the \"Dictionnaire Universel d'Histoire Naturelle,\" under the title\r\nof \"Tableau des Genres de Végétaux Fossiles, considérés sous le point\r\nde vue de leur classification botanique et de leur distribution\r\ngéologique.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nV. Fossil Cephalopoda, Nautilus, Ammonite, &c.--The fossil remains\r\nof the molluscous animals, named _Cephalopoda_, from their organs\r\nof prehension being arranged around the head or upper part of the\r\nbody, are the most ancient, numerous, and interesting, of this class\r\nof animated nature in the mineral kingdom. These relics are among\r\nthe most varied and striking of the extinct beings that occur in\r\nthe sedimentary strata, from the most ancient secondary formations,\r\nto the most recent tertiary. The living species are but a feeble\r\nrepresentation of the countless myriads which must have swarmed in\r\nthe ancient seas.\r\n\r\nThe animal of the Cephalopods is composed of a body, which is either\r\nenclosed in a shell, as in the Nautilus, or contains a calcareous\r\nosselet or support, as in the Sepia or Cuttle-fish; it has a distinct\r\nhead, and eyes as perfect as in the vertebrated animals, with\r\ncomplicated organs of hearing, and a powerful masticating apparatus,\r\nsurrounded by arms or tentacula. Below the head there is a tube which\r\nacts as a locomotive instrument, to propel the animal backwards, by\r\nthe forcible ejection of the water that has served the purpose of\r\nrespiration, and which can be ejected with considerable force by the\r\ncontraction of the body.\r\n\r\nTheir fossil remains consist of the external shell and the internal\r\nosselet; and in the naked tribes, of the soft parts of the body,\r\nthe ink-bag, &c., as noticed in the account of the Belemnite and\r\nBelemnoteuthis.\r\n\r\nThe shell varies exceedingly in the different genera. In the group\r\ncharacterised by smooth septa, and a medial or submedial siphuncle,\r\nas the Nautilus, the earliest or most ancient type is straight, as in\r\nthe _Orthoceras_ (Plate LVIII. fig. 14) of the palæozoic formations;\r\nthe intermediate forms present various modifications of the spiral,\r\nand terminate in the completely discoidal shell of the living genus;\r\nwhile the other group, that with sinuous or foliated septa and a\r\ndorsal siphuncle, commences in a discoidal type--the Ammonite, which\r\ngradually passes through the various modifications of _Crioceras_,\r\n_Scaphites_ (Plate LXI. fig. 10), _Hamites_ (Plate LXI. fig. 3),\r\n_Turrilites_ (Plate LXI. fig. 12), &c.; and finally becomes extinct\r\nin the straight Baculites (Plate LX. fig. 2).\r\n\r\nIn argillaceous strata, as the Kimmeridge and Oxford clay, London\r\nclay, &c., the shells of Cephalopoda are oftentimes beautifully\r\npreserved; the chambers are frequently filled with the solid matrix,\r\nbut in many instances these cavities are lined either with brilliant\r\npyrites or spar. Stony or sparry casts of the cells or chambers, the\r\nshell having perished, are another common state in which vestiges of\r\nthese animals occur. Sometimes the cast of each chamber is isolated,\r\nso as to present a series from the innermost to the outermost\r\ncell. Sections of those casts, in which the chambers are filled up\r\nwith spar, constitute specimens of great beauty and interest. The\r\nso-called snake-stones are, of course, mere casts of Ammonites;[104]\r\nthose of Whitby, from the lias limestone, are well known to every\r\ncollector; the casts of a very large species are common in the\r\noolite, especially at Swindon, in Wiltshire, and in the neighbourhood\r\nof Bath.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. The Carboniferous Deposits, or Coal Measures.--The various\r\ndeposits of Coal have manifestly been formed under different local\r\ncircumstances. Some have been peat-bogs, to which repeated additions\r\nhave been made by successive subsidences of the land; others have\r\nbeen deposited at the bottom of lakes and rivers, and these are\r\nassociated with remains of fresh-water shells and Crustacea; others\r\nhave accumulated in the abyss of the ocean, having been formed by\r\nthe drifting and engulfing of immense rafts of trees and other\r\nvegetable matter, like those of the Mississippi; others in inland\r\nseas, the successive layers of vegetables having been supplied by\r\nperiodical land-floods. There can be no doubt that coal has been,\r\nand may be, produced under all these conditions; and at different\r\nperiods, and in various localities, all these causes may have been in\r\noperation. But the great series of ancient coal-formations present\r\na remarkable uniformity of character, not only throughout Europe,\r\nbut also in America and other parts of the world. A coal-field (as\r\na group of strata of this kind is commonly termed), is generally\r\ncomposed of a series of layers of coal, clay, shale, and sand, of\r\nvariable thicknesses, based on grit or limestone, abounding in marine\r\nshells and corals; and the most remarkable phenomenon is the constant\r\npresence _beneath_ every bed of coal, of a thick stratum of earthy\r\nclay, and of a layer of shale or slaty clay above it. One of the\r\nseries of triple deposits of which a coal-field consists, presents\r\ntherefore the following characters:--\r\n\r\n1. _Under-clay_; the lowermost stratum. This is a tough argillaceous\r\nearth or clay, which on drying becomes of a grey colour, and\r\nvery friable; it is occasionally black, from an intermixture of\r\ncarbonaceous matter. This bed almost invariably contains an abundance\r\nof _Stigmariæ_ (see Plates XXII. XXIII.), of considerable length,\r\nwith their rootlets attached, and which extend in every direction\r\nthrough the clay (as shown in the figures 1, 2, 6, pp. 199, 201).\r\nThese roots commonly lie parallel with the planes of the stratum, and\r\nnearer to the top than to the bottom.\r\n\r\n2. _Coal._--A carbonized mass, in which the external forms of the\r\nplants and trees composing it are obliterated, but the internal\r\nstructure, in many instances, remains. Large trunks, and stems, and\r\nleaves, are rarely found in it.\r\n\r\n3. _The Roof_, or upper bed.--This consists of slaty clay, abounding\r\nin leaves, trunks and branches, fruit, &c.; it includes layers and\r\nnodules of ironstone, inclosing leaves, insects, Crustacea, &c. In\r\nsome localities beds of fresh-water shells, in others of marine\r\nshells, are intercalated with the shale; finely laminated clay,\r\nmicaceous sand, grit, and pebbles of limestone, sandstone, &c. are\r\nalso often interstratified. The principal illustrative specimens of\r\nthe leaves, fruit, &c. (as those in Plate XXX. to Plate XXXIV.) are\r\nfound in this bed.\r\n\r\nThus an uninterrupted series of strata, in which triple deposits of\r\nthis kind are repeated, (often thirty or forty times, and through\r\na thickness of several thousand feet,) constitutes the predominant\r\ncharacter of the ancient coal formations wherever they have been\r\nexplored. The difficulties attending a satisfactory solution of\r\nthis problem, are fully stated in the last edition of my Wonders of\r\nGeology (Vol. ii. Lecture vii.), and to that work I must refer the\r\nreader for a more extended consideration of this highly interesting\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 104: See Medals of Creation, vol. ii. chap. i.; and\r\nThoughts on a Pebble, pp. 20, 69.]\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. Coal.--The numerous fossil plants from the carboniferous strata\r\nthat are figured in this work, render it necessary to put the general\r\nreader in possession of a concise view of the nature and mode of\r\nformation of those ancient accumulations of vegetable matter, which\r\nnow constitute the beds of mineral fuel termed coal.\r\n\r\nAlthough at the present time no one at all conversant with geology\r\ndoubts the vegetable origin of Coal, the period is not distant when\r\nmany eminent philosophers were sceptical on this point; and the\r\ntruth in this, as in most other questions In natural philosophy,\r\nwas established with difficulty. The experiments and observations\r\nof the late Dr. Macculloch mainly contributed to solve the problem\r\nas to the vegetable origin of this substance; and that eminent\r\ngeologist successfully traced the transition of vegetable matter\r\nfrom peat-wood, brown coal, lignite, and jet, to coal, anthracite,\r\ngraphite, and plumbago. Nor must the important labours of Mr.\r\nParkinson in this field of research be forgotten. The first volume of\r\nthe \"Organic Remains of a former World,\" which treats of vegetable\r\nfossils, contains much original and valuable information on the\r\ntransmutation of vegetable matter, by bituminous fermentation, into\r\nthe various mineral substances in which its original nature and\r\nstructure are altogether changed and obliterated; and that work may\r\nstill be consulted with advantage by the student.\r\n\r\nBut though the vegetable origin of all coal will not admit of\r\nquestion, yet evidence of the original structure of the plants or\r\ntrees whence it was derived is not always attainable. The most\r\nperfect coal seems to have undergone a complete liquefaction, and\r\nif any portions of the vegetable tissue remain, they appear as\r\nif imbedded in a pure bituminous mass. The slaty coal generally\r\npreserves traces of cellular or vascular tissue, and the spiral\r\nvessels and dotted cells of coniferous trees may often be detected\r\nby the microscope. In many instances the cells are filled with an\r\namber-coloured resinous substance; in others the organization is so\r\nwell preserved, that on the surface of a block of coal cracked by\r\nheat, the vascular tissue, and the dotted glands, may be observed.\r\nSome beds of coal appear to be wholly composed of minute leaves or\r\ndisintegrated foliage; for if a mass recently extracted from the\r\nmine be split asunder, the exposed surfaces are found covered with\r\ndelicate laminæ of carbonized leaves and fibres matted together;\r\nand flake after flake may be peeled off through a thickness of many\r\ninches, and the same structure be apparent. Rarely are any large\r\ntrunks or branches observable in the beds of coal; but the general\r\nappearance of the carboniferous mass is that of an immense deposit of\r\ndelicate foliage shed and accumulated in a forest, and consolidated\r\nby great pressure while undergoing that peculiar process by which\r\nvegetable matter is converted into carbon.\r\n\r\nThe essential conditions for the transmutation of vegetable\r\nsubstances into coal, appear to be the imbedding of large quantities\r\nof recent vegetables beneath deposits which shall exclude the air,\r\nand prevent the escape of the gaseous elements when released by\r\ndecomposition from their organic combination; hence, according as\r\nthese conditions have been more or less perfectly fulfilled, coal,\r\njet, lignite, brown-coal, peat-wood, &c. will be the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. Fossil Corals.--The real nature even of recent Corals is in\r\ngeneral so imperfectly understood by the intelligent reader who has\r\nnot paid especial attention to the department of natural history\r\nwhich treats of the class of animated nature termed Zoophytes, that\r\nin describing the Fossil Corals In my Wonders of Geology, I felt\r\nit necessary to devote one Lecture to the consideration of Corals\r\nand Crinoidea, in order to afford a popular exposition of the\r\nstructure and economy of these highly Interesting tribes of animal\r\nexistence.[105]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 105: See Wonders of Geology, vol. ii. Lect. vi. p. 588.]\r\n\r\nA very prevalent error regarding their nature Is, that the beautiful\r\nstony substances generally called corals, are fabricated by the\r\nanimalcules which inhabit the cells when living, in the same manner\r\nas is the honeycomb of the bee and wasp. This opinion is utterly\r\nerroneous: the coral is secreted by the integuments or membranes with\r\nwhich when recent it was invested and permeated; in like manner as\r\nare the bones of the skeleton in the higher orders of animals by the\r\ntissues designed for that especial purpose, and wholly without the\r\ncognisance or control of the creature of which they constitute the\r\ninternal support.\r\n\r\nA general idea of the nature of the compound coral-zoophytes may be\r\nobtained by the examination of the common _Flustra_ or Sea-mat. This\r\nform of polyparia, when taken out of the water, appears to the naked\r\neye like a patch of fine varnished net-work, adhering to a piece of\r\nsea-weed or stone; when viewed with a magnifying lens of moderate\r\npower, the surface is found beset with pores regularly disposed:\r\nand if the Flustra be examined while immersed in sea-water, its\r\nsurface is seen to be invested by a gelatinous substance, and every\r\npore is the aperture of a cell, whence issues a tube fringed at the\r\nextremity with long tentacula or feelers. These expand, then suddenly\r\ncontract, withdraw into the cell, and again issue forth: the whole\r\nsurface of the Flustra being studded with the hydra-like animalcules;\r\neach enjoying a distinct existence, the entire group being united\r\nby one common integument or calcareous frame-work. When the Flustra\r\nis exposed to the air, the polypes soon perish, the animal matter\r\nrapidly decomposes, and the calcareous lace-like skeleton alone\r\nremains. In the larger and more compact corals the phenomena are\r\nsimilar, differing only in degree. In a fossil state, the durable\r\nremains of the corals consist for the most part of the calcareous\r\nframe-work (or polyparium, as it is termed), which often possesses a\r\ncrystalline structure; and in some instances is completely transmuted\r\ninto silex, as in specimens from Antigua, the Falls of the Ohio, and\r\nfrom Tisbury in Wiltshire. (See Plate XXXVIII. figs. 12, 13.)\r\n\r\nI must refer to the Wonders of Geology for a more extended notice\r\nof fossil corals, and other zoophytes, and will only add that the\r\ncalcareous and siliceous spines or spicula, not only of sponges, but\r\nalso of Gorgoniæ, and other corals, are often met with in a fossil\r\nstate.[106]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 106: See Wonders of Geology, vol. ii. Lect. vi. p. 634.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. Cuvier's Discoveries. _The Fossil Quadrupeds of Montmartre._\r\n(Plate LXXII.)--The Palæotheria, Anoplotheria, and other genera of\r\nextinct quadrupeds related to the _Tapir_, whose remains were first\r\nnoticed in the gypseous limestone of Montmartre, near Paris, and\r\nwhich have since been found in many other localities of the same\r\nstrata, are familiar to every one, from the just celebrity attached\r\nto the labours of the illustrious Cuvier, who restored as it were\r\nthese lost denizens of an earlier world, in their native character\r\nand forms, and distinguished them by names long since become\r\nclassical in the sciences which treat of the ancient history of the\r\nearth and its inhabitants.\r\n\r\nThe gypsum quarries spread over the flanks of Montmartre were many\r\nyears since known to contain fossil bones of extinct quadrupeds, and\r\nsome of these had been figured and described in 1768 by Guettard,\r\nand afterwards by Pralon, Lamanon, and Parumot: but it was not till\r\nthe attention of M. Cuvier was directed to the subject by some\r\nspecimens put into his hands by M. Vuarin, that the interest and\r\nimportance of these fossils were understood. The curiosity of Baron\r\nCuvier was so much excited by an inspection of a large collection\r\nof these bones, soon after he had been successfully engaged in the\r\ninvestigation of the remains of fossil Elephants and Mastodons,\r\nthat he immediately began to obtain specimens from the quarries,\r\nand by liberally rewarding the workmen, and by unremitting personal\r\nresearch, he soon accumulated an immense quantity of bones of all\r\nsorts, belonging to numerous individuals. He now perceived that\r\na new world was open to his view: and to use his own expressive\r\nlanguage, he found himself in an ancient charnel-house, surrounded\r\nby a confused multitude of mangled skeletons of a great variety of\r\nunknown beings. To arrange each fragment in its proper place, and\r\nrestore order to these heterogeneous materials, seemed at first a\r\nhopeless task: but a knowledge of the immutable laws by which the\r\norganization of animal existence is governed, soon enabled him to\r\nassign to each bone, and even fragment, its proper place in the\r\nskeleton; and the forms of beings hitherto unseen by mortal eye\r\nappeared before him. \"I cannot,\" he exclaims, \"express my delight in\r\nfinding how the application of one principle was instantly followed\r\nby the most triumphant results. The essential character of a tooth\r\nand its relation to the skull being determined, all the other\r\nelements of the fabric immediately fell into their proper places; and\r\nthe vertebra, ribs, bones of the legs, thigh, and feet, seemed to\r\narrange themselves even without my bidding, and in the very manner\r\nI had predicted.\" The principles of the correlation of structure\r\nwhich his profound researches in comparative anatomy had enabled\r\nhim to establish, conducted to these important results, and laid\r\nthe foundation of that science which has since received the name of\r\nPalæontology.[107] The mode of induction adopted by this illustrious\r\nphilosopher, has been the mighty instrument by which subsequent\r\nlabourers in this department of science have so largely contributed\r\nto our knowledge of the ancient condition of the earth, and of the\r\nstructure and economy of the tribes of beings which have successively\r\ndwelt upon it. The examination of the fossil teeth (in Plate LXXII.\r\nfigs. 4-9) showed that the animals were herbivorous; and the crown\r\nof the tooth being composed of two or three simple crescents, as in\r\ncertain pachydermata, proved that they differed from the ruminants,\r\nwhich have double crescents, and each four bands of enamel. The\r\ntwo principal genera first established were the _Palæotherium_ and\r\n_Anoplotherium_. The first approximates to the Tapirs in the number\r\nand disposition of the teeth; the second is remarkable in having no\r\nprojecting canines, and in all the teeth forming a continued series,\r\nas in the human race. Remains of both these genera have been found\r\nin the eocene tertiary strata of the Isle of Wight,[108] and on the\r\ncoast of Hampshire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 107: A concise exposition of the Cuvierian inductive\r\nphilosophy will be found in Wonders of Geology, pp. 137-147.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 108: See my Geological Excursions round the Isle of Wight.\r\nFor an account of the fossil animals of Paris, refer to Wonders of\r\nGeology, p. 254.]\r\n\r\n\r\nX. Fossil Edentata. _Megatherium, and Megalonyx_. (Plates LXXII.\r\nand LXXIII.)--The remains of these and other allied forms of the\r\nextinct gigantic Edentata, which once inhabited South America, occur\r\nin immense quantities throughout the Pampas--those vast plains which\r\npresent a sea of waving grass for 900 miles. These plains consist\r\nof alluvial loam and sand, containing fresh-water and marine shells\r\nof existing species; they were evidently once, like Lewes Levels,\r\na gulf or arm of the sea. Since the publication of Mr. Parkinson's\r\nwork, vast numbers of bones have been exhumed, and many most\r\ninteresting specimens sent to England by Sir Woodbine Parish, and\r\nCharles Darwin, Esq., in whose charming \"Journal of Researches into\r\nthe Natural History and Geology of the Countries visited during the\r\nVoyage of H.M.S. Beagle round the World,\" will be found many highly\r\ngraphic notices of the discovery of these remains.[109] Mr. Darwin,\r\nunder the head of _Bahia Blanca_,[110] describes the remains of no\r\nless than nine great quadrupeds found imbedded within the space of\r\n200 square yards. They consisted of three heads and other bones\r\nof the _Megatherium_, of enormous dimensions; and bones of the\r\n_Megalonyx_. Of the _Scelidotherium_, an allied animal, Mr. Darwin\r\nobtained an almost perfect skeleton; it must have been as large as a\r\nrhinoceros; in the structure of the head, it approaches nearest the\r\nCape ant-eater, in other respects it is related to the armadilloes.\r\nRemains of a different species of Mylodon, of another gigantic\r\nedental quadruped, and of a large animal with an osseous dermal coat\r\nin compartments, very like that of the Armadillo. Of this last, which\r\nhas been named _Glyptodon_, there is a very fine specimen in the\r\nHunterian Museum. Teeth and bones of an extinct species of horse,\r\nand of an unknown pachyderm, a huge beast with a long neck like the\r\ncamel. Lastly the _Toxodon_ (so named from the remarkable curvature\r\nof the teeth); this is perhaps one of the strangest animals ever\r\ndiscovered. In size it equals the elephant or megatherium, but the\r\nstructure of its teeth shows it to have been intimately related to\r\nthe gnawers--the order which at the present day includes the smallest\r\nquadrupeds. In many details it approaches to the pachydermata;\r\njudging from the position of its eyes, it was probably aquatic, like\r\nthe Dugong and Manatee, to which it is also allied.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 109: Published by Mr. Murray, in one vol. 1845. The\r\nanatomical description of the fossil Edentata brought home by Mr.\r\nDarwin, by Professor Owen, will be found in the \"Zoology of the\r\nVoyage of the Beagle.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 110: Mr. Darwin's Journal, chap. v. p. 81.]\r\n\r\nThe beds containing the above fossil remains, consist of stratified\r\ngravel and reddish mud, and stand only from fifteen to twenty feet\r\nabove the level of high water; hence the elevation of the land has\r\nbeen small since the great quadrupeds wandered over the surrounding\r\nplains; and the external features of the country must then have been\r\nvery nearly the same as now.\r\n\r\nIn another place, Mr. Darwin observes,--\"The number of the remains of\r\nthese large quadrupeds imbedded in the grand estuary deposit which\r\nforms the Pampas and covers the granitic rocks of Banda Oriental,\r\nmust be extraordinarily great. I believe, a straight line drawn in\r\nany direction through the Pampas, would cut through some skeleton\r\nor bones. Besides those which I found during my short excursions, I\r\nheard of many others; and the origin of such names as, 'the stream\r\nof the animal,' 'the hill of the giant,' is obvious. At other times,\r\nI heard of the marvellous property of certain rivers, which had the\r\npower of changing small bones into large; or as some maintained,\r\nthe bones themselves grew. As far as I am aware, not one of these\r\nanimals perished, as was formerly supposed, in the marshes or\r\nmuddy river-beds of the present land, but their bones have been\r\nexposed by the streams intersecting the subaqueous deposit, in\r\nwhich they were originally imbedded. We may conclude that the whole\r\narea of the Pampas is one wide sepulchre of these extinct gigantic\r\nquadrupeds.\"[111]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Mr. Darwin's Journal, p. 135. The reader interested\r\nin these extraordinary fossil remains should visit the British\r\nMuseum, and the Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of Surgeons in\r\nLincoln's Inn Fields.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. Flint.--_Animal Remains in siliceous nodules._--So many\r\nbeautiful specimens of siliceous petrifactions--that is, animal and\r\nvegetable remains transmuted into silex or flint--are figured in\r\nthe subjoined plates, that it may be useful to offer a few remarks\r\non this subject.[112] In many instances the organic remains in\r\nchalk-flints are simply incrusted by the silex; such is the state\r\nof numerous sponges which are as it were invested by the flint, and\r\nhave all their pores and tubes filled up by the same material, the\r\noriginal tissue appearing as a brown calcareous substance. In other\r\nexamples, the sponge has been enveloped in a mass of liquid flint,\r\nand has subsequently perished and decomposed; in this manner have\r\nbeen formed those hollow nodules, which on being broken present a\r\ncavity containing only a little white powder, or some fragments of\r\nsilicified sponge; in many instances the cavity is lined with quartz\r\ncrystals, or mammillated chalcedony. Frequently but part of the\r\nzoophyte is permeated by the silex, and the other portion is in the\r\nstate of a friable calcareous earth imbedded in the chalk. Sponges\r\nand other zoophytes often form the nuclei of the flint nodules; the\r\noriginal substance of the organic body being in general silicified,\r\nand the most delicate internal structure preserved. Shells, corals,\r\nand the minute cases of foraminifera, are often immersed as it were\r\nin pure flint, appearing as if preserved in a semi-transparent medium.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: See Wonders of Geology, vol. i. pp. 74-105, for a\r\ngeneral view of the process of petrifaction.]\r\n\r\nBut there are innumerable flint nodules in which no traces of\r\nspongeous tissue are apparent, and veins, dikes, and sheets of\r\ntabular flint, that are in a great measure free from organic remains;\r\ncontaining only such as may be supposed to have become imbedded in a\r\nstream of fluid silex that flowed over a sea-bottom. Wood perforated\r\nby lithodomi and silicified, is occasionally met with; and fuci or\r\nalgæ are sometimes found, appearing as if floating in the liquid\r\nflint.\r\n\r\nFor the most part, the minute shells in the chalk and flint are\r\nfilled with amorphous mineral matter; but in many examples, (as\r\nI have ascertained by direct experiment,) the soft parts of\r\nforaminifera remain in the shell.\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. Foraminifera.--Plate LXII. contains figures of several species\r\nbelonging to various genera of those minute fossil shells, the\r\ndiscoidal involute forms of which were once considered to belong\r\nto the Cephalopoda, and to be related to the Nautilus, Spirula,\r\n&c., but which are now grouped in one family, under the name of\r\n_Foraminifera_; a term derived from the foramina or perforations with\r\nwhich their shells are traversed, and which have relation to the\r\npeculiar organization of the animals.\r\n\r\nSince microscopic observations have become so general, thanks to\r\nthe genius and enthusiasm of Ehrenberg, these fossil bodies have\r\nacquired a degree of interest and importance, unsurpassed by more\r\nobvious organic remains. Whole mountain chains and extensive tracts\r\nof country are now known to be almost entirely composed of the\r\naggregated shells of a few genera of these _microzoa_.[113] In other\r\ndeposits their remains are associated with those of _Infusoria_,[114]\r\n(both animal and vegetable,) still more infinitesimal. As much\r\nerror prevails among collectors as to the real nature of the fossil\r\nforaminifera, I am induced to annex the following remarks.[115]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: A convenient term to express animal organisms that can\r\nonly be distinctly examined by the aid of the microscope: strata in a\r\ngreat measure composed of such fossil remains may be distinguished as\r\n_microzoic_ deposits.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: This term was first employed to denote the various\r\nminute forms of animal organization that appear in vegetable\r\ninfusions; as Rotifers, Monads, Vorticella, &c. But with these,\r\nnumerous vegetable forms generally appear, as Gaillonella,\r\nBacellaria, Navicula, &c.: these were formerly also regarded as\r\nanimals, and were consequently comprised under the same general\r\nappellation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: The best scientific account of these animals will be\r\nfound in M. D'Orbigny's work on the \"Foraminifères Fossiles du Bassin\r\nTertiaire de Vienne, (Autriche).\" Paris, 1846. 1 vol. 4to, with\r\nplates.]\r\n\r\nThe foraminifera are marine animals of low organization, and, with\r\nbut few exceptions, extremely minute: in an ounce of sea-sand between\r\nthree and four millions have been distinctly enumerated. When living,\r\nthey are not aggregated, but always individually distinct; they are\r\ncomposed of a body (or vital mass) of a gelatinous consistence, which\r\nis either entire, and round, or divided into segments, placed either\r\non a simple or alternate line, or coiled spirally, or involuted\r\nround an axis. This body is covered with an envelope or shell, which\r\nis generally testaceous, rarely cartilaginous, and is modelled on\r\nthe segments, and follows all the modifications of form and contour\r\nof the body. From the extremity of the last segment, there issue,\r\nsometimes from one, sometimes from several openings of the shell,\r\nor through numerous pores or foramina, very elongated, slender,\r\ncontractile, colourless filaments, more or less divided and ramified,\r\nserving for prehension, and capable of entirely investing the shell.\r\nThe body varies in colour, but is always identical in individuals of\r\nthe same species,--it is yellow, fawn-coloured, red, violet, blue,\r\n&c. Its consistence is variable; it is composed of minute globules,\r\nthe aggregation of which determines the general tint. It is sometimes\r\nentire, round, and without segments, as in _Gromia_, _Orbulina_, &c.,\r\nwhich represent, at all ages, the embryonic state of all the other\r\ngenera. They increase, without doubt, by the entire circumference.\r\nWhen the body is divided by lobes or segments, the primary lobe,\r\nas in the permanent condition of the Gromia, is at first round or\r\noval, according to the genus; once formed it never enlarges, but is\r\nenveloped externally by testaceous matter; it may be compared to a\r\nball on which is applied a second larger one, then a third still\r\nlarger, and so on during the life of the animal.\r\n\r\nThe annexed figure of the animal of _Nummulina_ (as given by MM.\r\nJoly and Leymerie) will serve to convey a general idea of the living\r\nForaminifera.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ANIMAL OF THE NUMMULINA.]\r\n\r\nThe segments, as the body increases, are agglomerated in six\r\ndifferent ways, and these modifications are the basis of M.\r\nD'Orbigny's classification. The discoidal forms, as the _Rotalia_,\r\n_Rosalina_, _Cristellaria_, &c. are involuted like the nautilus,\r\nand divided by septa or partitions, the different lobes of the body\r\noccupying contemporaneously every chamber, and being connected by a\r\ntube or canal that extends through the entire series. In the spiral\r\nforms, the _Textilaria_, &c. the same structure is apparent. These\r\ntwo groups are the most abundant in the cretaceous strata; many beds\r\nof the white chalk consist almost wholly of the aggregated shells\r\nof the Rosalinæ, Rotaliæ, and Textilariæ.[116] Whatever the form of\r\nthe body, the filaments always consist of a colourless matter as\r\ntransparent as glass; they elongate from the base to six times the\r\ndiameter of the shell. They often divide and subdivide, so as to\r\nappear branched. Though alike in form in the different genera, they\r\nvary much in their position. In some they form a bundle which issues\r\nfrom a single opening, and is withdrawn into the same by contraction;\r\nin others the filaments project only through each of the pores in\r\nthe shell which covers the last segment; in others they issue from\r\nboth the large aperture and the foramina. In fine, these filaments or\r\npseudopodia fulfil in the foraminifera the functions of the numerous\r\ntentacula in the Asteriadæ, or Star-fishes, serving as instruments of\r\nlocomotion and attachment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: See Wonders of Geology, p. 299]\r\n\r\nNeither organs of nutriment nor of reproduction have been detected.\r\nIn the genera having one large aperture from which the filaments\r\nissue and retract, we can conceive nutriment to be absorbed by that\r\nopening; but this cannot be the case in the species which have\r\nthe last cell closed up; in these the filaments issuing through\r\nthe foramina are probably also organs of nutrition. M. D'Orbigny\r\nconsiders the Foraminifera as constituting a distinct class in\r\nzoology; less complicated than the Echinoderms and the Polypiaria in\r\ntheir internal organization, they have by their filaments the mode of\r\nlocomotion of the first, and by their free, individual existence--not\r\naggregated and immovably fixed--they are more advanced in the scale\r\nof being than the latter. To me they appear to be merely hydra-form\r\npolypes of the most simple structure, protected by shells;[117] those\r\ncomposed of different segments, I conceive to be a single aggregated\r\nindividual, and not a successive series of beings.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: An admirable paper on the \"_Polystomella crispa_,\" by\r\nMr. Williamson, of Manchester, (Trans. Micros. Society of London,\r\nvol. ii.) should be consulted on this question.]\r\n\r\nThe white chalk is well known to be largely composed of a few kinds\r\nof foraminifera, but the occurrence of the soft bodies of these\r\nanimalcules in a fossil state was first discovered by me, in 1845,\r\nin chalk-flints, and was announced in a paper, read before the\r\nGeological Society, entitled, \"_Notes of a Microscopical Examination\r\nof Chalk and Flint_.\"[118] This statement was regarded by some\r\neminent palæontologists as so \"startling and unsatisfactory,\" that I\r\nresumed the investigation, and communicated the result to the Royal\r\nSociety, in a memoir \"_On the Fossil Remains of the Soft Parts of\r\nForaminifera discovered in the Chalk and Flint of the South-East of\r\nEngland_;\"[119] and with the kind assistance of that able chemist\r\nand microscopist, Mr. Henry Deane, of Clapham Common, I obtained,\r\nby immersing chalk in dilute hydrochloric acid, and mounting the\r\nresidue in Canada balsam, several specimens of the entire integuments\r\nof the bodies of Rotaliæ, as distinct as if recent! This fact is\r\nnow admitted; and the experiment has been successfully repeated in\r\nIndia, by Mr. Carter, on the limestones of that country;[120] and in\r\nAmerica, by Dr. Bailey, &c.[121] In some limestone recently collected\r\nby my eldest son, Mr. Walter Mantell, in the Middle Island of New\r\nZealand, and which, like our cretaceous strata, is almost entirely\r\nmade up of foraminifera, I have detected the soft parts of the bodies\r\nof Rotaliæ in the cells of the fossil shells, as distinctly as in the\r\nchalk of England; and two of the species appear to be identical with\r\nEuropean forms.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: These \"Notes\" were withdrawn, and published in the\r\nAnnals of Natural History for August, 1845.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Published in Philos. Trans. Part iv. for 1846.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120: \"On the existence of Beds of Foraminifera, recent and\r\nfossil, on the South-East of Arabia,\" by H. J. Carter, Esq. Assistant\r\nSurgeon, Bombay. Proceedings of the Bombay Asiatic Society, 1848.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121: A remarkable foraminiferous deposit of chalk detritus\r\noccurs at Charing, in Kent, and was first examined and described\r\nby William Harris, Esq.; it contains immense numbers of many kinds\r\nof foraminifera, and of the cases or shells of entomostraca, of\r\nthe genus Cytherina, with spicules of sponges, &c.--See Wonders of\r\nGeology, vol. 1. p. 324.]\r\n\r\nM. D'Orbigny gives the following summary of the distribution of the\r\nknown fossil species of Foraminifera:--\r\n\r\nThere are 228 species in the Tertiary deposits of Vienna alone, of\r\nwhich twenty-seven species are known living in the Adriatic and the\r\nMediterranean.\r\n\r\nForaminifera are unknown in the Silurian and Devonian formations.\r\n\r\nOne species only is known in the Carboniferous system of Russia, the\r\n_Fusulina cylindrica_.\r\n\r\n  Jurassic or Oolitic formation     Genera  5 Species  20\r\n  Cretaceous                           \"   34    \"    280\r\n  Tertiary                             \"   56    \"    450\r\n  Living in the present seas           \"   68    \"  1,000\r\n\r\nOf these last, 575 species inhabit tropical seas, 350 the seas of\r\ntemperate, and 75 the seas of cold climates.\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. Fossil Elk of Ireland, or _Cervus megaloceros_. (Plate\r\nLXXI.)--The shell-marls of Ireland contain in abundance the bones of\r\nan animal, which like the Dodo, was once contemporary with the human\r\nspecies, but has long been extinct: the last individuals of the race\r\nwere, in all probability, exterminated by the early Celtic tribes.\r\nThe remains of this noble creature generally occur in the deposits of\r\nmarl that underlie the peat-bogs, which are apparently, like those\r\nof Scotland, the sites of ancient lakes or bays. In Curragh immense\r\nquantities of these bones lie within a small area; the skeletons\r\nappear to be entire, and are found with the skull elevated, and the\r\nantlers thrown back on the shoulders, as if a small herd of these\r\nElks had sought refuge in the marshes, and had been engulfed in\r\nthe morass, in the same manner as the Mastodons of America. (See\r\ndescription of Plate LXXIV., ante, p. 167.)\r\n\r\nThis creature far exceeded in magnitude any living species of elk\r\nor deer. The skeleton is upwards often feet in height to the top of\r\nthe skull, and the antlers are from ten to fourteen feet from one\r\nextremity to the other. The fine perfect skeletons in the British\r\nMuseum, College of Surgeons, and in the Museum at Edinburgh, render\r\na particular description unnecessary. The bones are generally well\r\npreserved, of a dark brown colour, with patches of blue phosphate\r\nof iron. In some instances they are in so fresh a condition, that\r\nthe hollows of the long bones contain marrow having the appearance\r\nof fresh suet. Remains of this majestic animal have been found\r\ncollocated with ancient sepulchral urns, stone implements, and rude\r\ncanoes, in such manner, as to leave no doubt that this now extinct\r\ndeer was coeval with the early human inhabitants of these Islands.\r\nIts bones and antlers have been found at Walton, in Essex, associated\r\nwith the remains of the Mammoth, or fossil elephant.[122]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122: Wonders of Geology, p. 134.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. Fossil Infusoria--_Infusorial Earths_.--In the note on\r\nForaminifera some account is given of various rocks composed of the\r\nfossil remains of those minute animals; but the durable relics of the\r\nyet more infinitesimal organisms designated by the terms _Infusoria_,\r\nor _Infusorial animalcules_, form deposits of equal interest and\r\nimportance. Strata of great extent and thickness are wholly, or\r\nin great part, made up of innumerable layers, consisting of the\r\naggregated siliceous cases or shields of Infusoria: and similar\r\nstructures are found to be the chief constituents of the white earthy\r\ndeposits of lakes, rivers, and basins of brackish water, in every\r\npart of the world.\r\n\r\nSlowly, imperceptibly, but incessantly, are the vital energies of\r\nthe feeblest and minutest animal and vegetable existences separating\r\nfrom the element in which they live, the most enduring of mineral\r\nsubstances, silex--fabricating it into structures of the most\r\nexquisite forms and sculpturing, and thus adding to the accumulations\r\nof countless ages, which make up the sedimentary strata of the crust\r\nof the globe.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Medals of Creation\"[123] will be found a summary of what\r\nwas then known as to the formation and composition of many tertiary\r\ndeposits which the indefatigable Ehrenberg, Dr. Bailey, and other\r\neminent observers, had carefully investigated and described. The\r\nfive years that have since elapsed have been fruitful in results of\r\nthe most important and interesting character; from every quarter of\r\nthe world, from the loftiest mountain peaks, and from the deepest\r\nrecesses of the ocean which the plummet can reach, from the ashes of\r\nvolcanoes and from the snow of the glaciers, the durable remains of\r\nInfusoria have been obtained. That excellent scientific periodical,\r\nSilliman's American Journal, contains numerous interesting\r\ncommunications on this subject from the eminent chemical professor\r\nof the Military College at West Point, Dr. J. W. Bailey; and the\r\nlabours of Mr. Bowerbank, Williamson, and other active members of\r\nthe Microscopical Society of London, have yielded much interesting\r\ninformation on the infusorial deposits of our own country.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123: Medals of Creation, vol. i. p. 211.]\r\n\r\nThe present note will be restricted to remarks on the nature of the\r\norganisms which enter so largely into the composition of certain\r\ntertiary deposits; since the opinion once entertained of the\r\nanimal nature of many infusoria, now regarded as true vegetables,\r\nmaterially affects the geological conclusions respecting the\r\npersistence of certain species of organisms through long periods of\r\ntime, during which the mollusca, zoophytes, &c. underwent repeated\r\nmutations both in the species and genera. Thus, for example, the\r\n_polierschiefer_, or polishing-slate of Bilin, and the berghmehl\r\nof Tuscany, are described by Ehrenberg as masses of the siliceous\r\nshells of animalcules of such extreme minuteness, that a cubic inch\r\nof the stone contains upwards of forty millions; the infusorial\r\nearth of Richmond, in Virginia, in like manner, is stated to be\r\nmade up of the siliceous skeletons of animalcules of infinitesimal\r\nminuteness. But later investigations have (I conceive) satisfactorily\r\nestablished, that the greater part of these fossil organisms belongs\r\nto the vegetable and not to the animal kingdom.[124] The whole of the\r\nfigures in Plate IV. of the \"Medals of Creation,\" described as living\r\nInfusoria, on the authority of Ehrenberg, are undoubted vegetables,\r\nbelonging to the great botanical groups called _Diatomaceæ_ (from the\r\nangular segments into which they separate by partial division), and\r\n_Desmidiaceæ_.[125] The entire family of _Bacillaria_ belongs to this\r\ngroup. These simplest forms of vegetable structures abound in every\r\nlake or stream of fresh and brackish water, in every pool, or bay,\r\nand throughout the ocean, from the equator to the poles; they secrete\r\nsiliceous envelopes, which present an endless variety of form and\r\nstructure, and after the death and decomposition of the perishable\r\ntissues of the plants, remain as perfectly transparent colourless\r\nshields of pure silica; such are the _Gaillonellæ_, _Euastra_,\r\n_Closteria_, _Naviculæ_, _Synhedræ_, _Podospheniæ_, _Xanthidia_,\r\n&c., which constitute so large a proportion of the infusorial earths\r\ndescribed by Ehrenberg and other authors.[126]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124: In my little work on Recent Infusoria, entitled\r\n\"Thoughts on Animalcules, or a Glimpse of the Invisible World\r\nrevealed by the Microscope,\" I have expressed my conviction of\r\nthe vegetable nature of these organisms, as a reason for omitting\r\nfigures and descriptions of any of the species in a work on living\r\nfresh-water animalcules.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: The name Diatomaceæ is restricted by M. Brébisson to\r\nthose species which have a siliceous envelope, or cuticle; and that\r\nof _Desmidiæ_ to those which are not siliceous, but reducible by heat\r\nto carbon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: The reader interested in this subject should consult\r\nthe beautiful work of Mr. Hassall on the Desmidiaceæ, published by\r\nMessrs. Reeve & Benham.]\r\n\r\nThe extent of this infinitesimal flora throughout regions where no\r\nother forms of vegetation are known, is strikingly demonstrated by\r\nthe observations of the eminent botanist and traveller. Dr. Hooker,\r\nin his account of the Antarctic regions.\r\n\r\n\"Everywhere,\" he states, \"the waters and the ice alike abound in\r\nthese microscopic vegetables. Though too small to be visible to the\r\nunassisted eye, their aggregated masses stained the iceberg and\r\npack-ice wherever they were washed by the sea, and imparted a pale\r\nochreous colour to the ice. From the south of the belt of ice which\r\nencircles the globe, to the highest latitudes reached by man, this\r\nvegetation is everywhere conspicuous, from the contrast between its\r\ncolour and that of the white snow and ice in which it is imbedded. In\r\nthe eightieth degree of south latitude all the surface ice carried\r\nalong by currents, and the sides of every berg, and the base of the\r\ngreat Victoria barrier itself--a perpendicular wall of ice, from one\r\nto two hundred feet above the sea-level--were tinged brown from this\r\ncause, as if the waters were charged with oxide of iron. The majority\r\nof these plants consist of simple vegetable cells, enclosed in\r\nindestructible silex (as other _Algæ_ are in carbonate of lime); and\r\nit is obvious that the death of such multitudes must form sedimentary\r\ndeposits of immense extent.\r\n\r\n\"The universal existence of such an invisible vegetation as that of\r\nthe Antarctic ocean, is u truly wonderful fact, and the more so,\r\nfrom its being unaccompanied by plants of a high order. This ocean\r\nswarms with mollusca, and entomostracous crustaceans, small whales,\r\nand porpoises; and the sea with penguins and seals, and the air with\r\nbirds: the animal kingdom is everywhere present, the larger creatures\r\npreying on the smaller, and these again on those more minute; all\r\nliving nature seems to be carnivorous. This microscopic vegetation is\r\nthe sole nutrition of the herbivorous animals; and it may likewise\r\nserve to purify the atmosphere, and thus execute in the antarctic\r\nlatitudes the office of the trees and grasses of the temperate\r\nregions, and the broad foliage of the palms of the tropics.\"[127]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: From Dr. Hooker's account of the botany of the South\r\nPolar regions in Sir J. Ross's Voyages of Discovery.]\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker also observes, that the siliceous cases of the same kind\r\nof Diatomaceæ now living in the waters of the South Polar Ocean,\r\nhave contributed in past ages to the formation of European strata;\r\nfor the tripoli and the phonolite stones of the Rhine contain the\r\nsiliceous shields of identical species. Such are the comments of one\r\nof our most eminent botanists on the phenomena under review. The\r\nreader will probably ask,--What, then, are the essential characters\r\nwhich separate the animal from the vegetable kingdom? To this\r\nquestion it is impossible to give a satisfactory reply: perhaps the\r\nonly distinction that will be generally admitted by zoologists and\r\nbotanists is the following:--_animals require organic substances for\r\ntheir support; vegetables derive their sustenance from inorganic\r\nmatter_.\r\n\r\nThe facts thus cursorily reviewed throw much doubt on many of M.\r\nEhrenberg's statements as to the identity of species of animalcules\r\nnow living, with those whose remains occur in the eocene, and in\r\nthe secondary strata. The so-called _Xanthidia_ of the chalk, are\r\ncertainly altogether distinct from the recent diatomæ to which the\r\nname was first applied; the chalk organisms are probably the gemmules\r\nof sponges or other zoophytes.[128]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: It would be convenient to distinguish these fossils by\r\nanother name, and thus avoid the perpetuation of the error; I would\r\npropose that of _Spiniferites_, in allusion to the numerous spines\r\nwith which all the species are beset.]\r\n\r\nInfusorial earths may therefore be composed either of microscopic\r\nvegetable or animal remains, or of both. The brackish and\r\nfresh-water deposits I have examined are siliceous and almost wholly\r\ndiatomaceous: the marine calcareous strata composed of microscopic\r\norganisms, consist chiefly of various kinds of foraminifera, a large\r\nproportion belonging to the polythalamia, or chambered shells. I\r\nam not certain as to the animal or vegetable nature of some of\r\nthe beautiful siliceous disks (_Coscinodisci_, _Arachnoidisci_,\r\n_Actinocyclus_, &c.) so abundant in the Richmond, Barbadoes, and\r\nBermuda infusorial earths, and which occur in so splendid a state in\r\nthe Guano deposits of Ichaboe.\r\n\r\nWith the corrections which the above remarks will enable the reader\r\nto make, I would refer to the account of Fossil Infusoria in the\r\nMedals of Creation, and Wonders of Geology. [129]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: See also \"Thoughts on Animalcules.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. The Mosasaurus, or _Fossil Reptile of Maestricht_. (Plate LXX.)\r\nThe occasional discovery of bones and teeth of an unknown animal\r\nin the limestone of St. Peter's Mountain, near Maestricht, and the\r\ninnumerable shells, corals, teeth of fishes, claws of crabs, echini,\r\nand other organic remains, had long since attracted the attention\r\nof naturalists, and rendered these quarries celebrated throughout\r\nEurope. In 1770, M. Hoffman, the surgeon of the Fort, who had for\r\nsome years been assiduously collecting the fossils of this locality,\r\nhad the good fortune to discover a specimen which has conferred an\r\nenduring celebrity on his name. Some workmen, on blasting the rock\r\nin one of the caverns of the interior of the mountain, perceived to\r\ntheir astonishment the jaws of a large animal attached to the roof of\r\nthe chasm. The discovery was immediately made known to M. Hoffman,\r\nwho repaired to the spot, and for weeks presided over the arduous\r\ntask of separating the mass of stone containing these remains from\r\nthe surrounding rock. His labours were rewarded by the successful\r\nextrication of the specimen, which he conveyed in triumph to his\r\nhouse. This extraordinary discovery soon became the subject of\r\ngeneral conversation, and upon reaching the ears of the Canon of the\r\ncathedral which stands on the mountain, excited in that functionary\r\na determination to claim the fossil, in right of being lord of the\r\nmanor; and he unfortunately succeeded, after a long and harassing\r\nlawsuit, in obtaining this precious relic. It remained for years in\r\nhis possession, and Hoffman died without regaining his treasure,\r\nor receiving any compensation. At length the French revolution\r\nbroke out, and the armies of the republic advanced to the gates of\r\nMaestricht. The town was bombarded; but at the suggestion of the\r\ncommittee of savans who accompanied the French troops to select their\r\nshare of plunder, the artillery was not suffered to bombard that part\r\nof the city in which the celebrated fossil was known to be preserved.\r\nIn the mean time, the Canon of St. Peter's, shrewdly suspecting the\r\nreason why such peculiar favour was shown to his residence, removed\r\nthe specimen, and concealed it in a vault; but when the city was\r\ntaken, the French authorities compelled him to give up his ill-gotten\r\nprize, which was immediately transmitted to the Jardin des Plantes,\r\nat Paris, where it still forms one of the most striking objects in\r\nthat magnificent collection.[130]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: Faujus St. Fond, in whose beautiful work on the\r\nfossils of St. Peter's Mountain the above account is given, remarks\r\nwith much sang froid, \"La _justice_, quoique tardive, arrive enfin\r\navec le tems!\" The reader will probably think that although the Canon\r\nwas justly despoiled of his ill-gotten treasure, the French _savans_\r\nwere a very equivocal personification of _Justice_!]\r\n\r\nThe beautiful model of this most interesting fossil in the British\r\nMuseum, was presented to me by Baron Cuvier. It is four and a half\r\nfeet long, and two and a half wide; it consists of the jaws, with\r\nteeth, palatal bones, and the tympanic bone, or _os quadratum_,\r\na bone possessed by reptiles, as well as birds, and in which the\r\nauditory cells are contained. There are likewise some fine portions\r\nof jaws, with teeth, in the British Museum, presented by Camper.\r\nThe original animal was probably a terrestrial reptile, holding an\r\nintermediate place between the Monitors and Iguanas. It was about\r\ntwenty-five feet long.\r\n\r\nI discovered, many years since (1820), some vertebræ in the chalk\r\nnear Lewes, which closely resemble the corresponding bones of the\r\nMosasaurus, and in all probability belong to another species. In the\r\ncretaceous strata of New Jersey, Dr. Harlan found and described, and\r\nmy friend. Dr. Morton, of Philadelphia, sent me, in 1834, teeth which\r\ncannot be distinguished from those of Maestricht. Vertebræ, and other\r\nbones, have since been obtained from the same deposits by Professor\r\nRogers, and described by Professor Owen in the Geological Journal.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. Fossil Reptiles. Although when Mr. Parkinson's work was\r\npublished many fossil bones and teeth of reptiles had been discovered\r\nin various parts of England, yet the abundance and variety, and\r\nthe extraordinary modification of form and structure of this class\r\nof vertebrated animals, which prevailed throughout the secondary\r\ngeological formations, were not for a moment suspected. The few\r\nexamples of the remains of fossil reptiles described by Mr.\r\nParkinson, serve to mark the degree of knowledge which then existed\r\nrespecting a department of palæontology that rapidly acquired an\r\nimportance and interest unsurpassed by any other branch of fossil\r\nosteology.\r\n\r\nThe announcement of the founder of palæontology,[131] that there\r\nwas a period when the lakes and rivers of our planet were peopled\r\nby reptiles, and cold-blooded oviparous quadrupeds of appalling\r\nmagnitude were the principal inhabitants of the dry land; when\r\nthe seas swarmed with saurians, exclusively adapted for a marine\r\nexistence, and the regions of the atmosphere were traversed by winged\r\nlizards instead of birds; was an enunciation so novel and startling,\r\nas to require all the prestige of the name of Cuvier, to obtain for\r\nit any degree of attention and credence, even with those who were\r\nsufficiently enlightened to admit, that a universal deluge would not\r\naccount for the physical mutations which the surface of the earth and\r\nits inhabitants had, in the lapse of innumerable ages, undergone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: In the \"Ossemens Fossiles;\" tom. v. Reptiles Fossiles.]\r\n\r\nSubsequent discoveries have established the truth of this proposition\r\nto an extent beyond what even its promulgator could have surmised;\r\nand the \"_Age of Reptiles_\" is now admitted into the category of\r\nestablished facts.\r\n\r\nDuring the incalculable ages which the formation of the various\r\nsystems of secondary strata must have comprised, we find no evidence\r\nin the fossils hitherto observed, of the existence of birds and\r\nmammalia, as the characteristic types of the faunas of the dry land.\r\nOn the contrary, throughout the immense accumulations of the spoils\r\nof the ancient islands and continents, amidst innumerable relics of\r\nreptiles of various orders and genera, a few jaws and bones of two or\r\nthree kinds of extremely small marsupials, and the bones of a species\r\nof wader, are the sole indications of the presence of the two grand\r\nclasses of Aves and Mammalia, which now constitute the chief features\r\nof the terrestrial zoology of almost all countries.\r\n\r\nThe earliest indications of air-breathing vertebrata in the ancient\r\nsecondary formations are those of small saurian reptiles in the\r\ncarboniferous strata; a few vestiges occur in the succeeding group,\r\nthe Permian. In the next epoch, the Triassic, colossal Batrachians\r\n(_Labyrinthodonts_) appear; and on some of the strata of this\r\nformation are the footmarks of numerous bipeds, presumed to be those\r\nof birds; but at present the evidence of the bones of the animals\r\nthat made those imprints is required to establish the hypothesis.\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding eras, the Lias, Oolite, Wealden, and Cretaceous,\r\nswarms of reptiles of numerous genera and species everywhere prevail;\r\nreptiles fitted to fly through the air, to roam over the land, to\r\ninhabit the lakes, rivers, and seas; and yet not one identical\r\nwith any existing forms! These beings gradually decline in numbers\r\nand species as we approach the close of the secondary periods,\r\nand are immediately succeeded in the eocene epoch, by as great a\r\npreponderance of warm-blooded vertebrata--birds and mammalia--as\r\nexists at the present time; and an equal decadence in the class of\r\nreptiles. With the Cretaceous Formation the \"Age of Reptiles\" may be\r\nsaid to terminate.\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII.--Fossil Reptiles of the Wealden. _The Iguanodon._ The\r\nfluviatile deposits (termed _Wealden_), which in the south-east\r\nof England, and in the north of Germany, are intercalated between\r\nthe oolitic and cretaceous formations, abound in the bones of\r\nterrestrial, fresh-water, and marine reptiles, comprising some of\r\nthe most colossal land-saurians which have hitherto been brought\r\nto light. These remains belong to various genera of Chelonians,\r\nSaurians, and Crocodilians; and with these are associated those of\r\nflying lizards (_Pterodactyles_), Plesiosauri, gigantic whale-like\r\nreptiles (_Cetiosauri_), and of other oviparous quadrupeds of unknown\r\nspecies and genera.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of fossils of this nature in the strata forming the\r\ndistricts denominated the Wealds of Sussex and Kent, was first\r\nbrought under the notice of geologists in 1822, in my work on the\r\n\"Fossils of the South Downs,\" in which the remains of several\r\nunknown reptiles were described; and among them the teeth and bones\r\nof that extraordinary herbivorous lizard, the _Iguanodon_, on which\r\nI am induced to offer a few observations in this place; the recent\r\ndiscovery of some previously undetermined parts of the skeleton,\r\nhaving materially elucidated the structure and economy of the\r\noriginal.[132]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: The following is the description of the specimens\r\nfirst discovered, given in the \"Fossils of the South Downs; or,\r\nIllustrations of the Geology of Sussex,\" 1 vol. 4to. 1822: \"Incisors\r\nand molar teeth evidently belonging to the same species of animal:\r\nthey differ from any previously known; the masticating surface is\r\nperfectly smooth and rather depressed in the centre; these teeth\r\nconsist of the crown only, and are quite solid. An incisor tooth\r\n1.3 inch long Is slightly bowed and smooth on its inner surface;\r\nbut it has externally a ridge which extends longitudinally down the\r\nfront. Its sides are angular and the edges finely crenated.\" From\r\nthe resemblance of these teeth in their general form to those of\r\nthe Iguana, a common land lizard in the West Indies, I subsequently\r\nproposed the name of _Iguanodon_ (implying an animal having teeth\r\nlike the Iguana) for the fossil reptile. The teeth of an Iguana\r\nfour or five feet long are not larger than those of a mouse; the\r\nIguanodon's teeth are as large as the incisors of the rhinoceros. The\r\nIguana's teeth, when used, are chipped off at the points, no existing\r\nreptile being capable of performing mastication; the teeth of the\r\nIguanodon, on the contrary, are ground down like the worn molars of\r\nherbivorous mammalia, as I pointed out in my first memoir in the\r\nPhilos. Trans. 1825.]\r\n\r\nSince the first announcement of the discovery of the remains of the\r\nIguanodon, vast quantities of bones belonging to a great number of\r\nindividuals of all ages have been collected; but until a few years\r\nsince, not a vestige of the jaws had been observed, notwithstanding\r\nthe most diligent research. In the early part of the year 1848, I\r\nwas surprised and highly gratified by receiving from Capt. Lambart\r\nBrickenden (at that time a personal stranger to me), who then resided\r\nat Warminglid, near Cuckfield, in Sussex, the greater part of the\r\nright side (or _ramus_) of the lower jaw, with several successional\r\nteeth in their natural position, of an adult Iguanodon.[133] See p.\r\n202.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: This beautiful and most instructive specimen is now in\r\nmy possession; it is figured of the natural size in Philos. Trans.\r\nPart ii. for 1848, Plate XVI., as well as the portion of upper jaw in\r\nthe British Museum, Plate XIX. The character of the upper and lower\r\nteeth of the Iguanodon are well represented in Plate XVIII. of the\r\nsame memoir.\r\n\r\nA specimen very similar to that discovered by Capt. Brickenden,\r\nbut of a young individual, was found soon afterwards in a quarry\r\nnear Horsham; but I was not allowed the privilege of figuring or\r\ndescribing it!]\r\n\r\nIn the course of last summer I obtained a very instructive fragment\r\nof the middle part of the right ramus of the lower jaw of a much\r\nlarger Iguanodon, found by Mr. Fowlestone, with some enormous bones\r\nof the extremities, in the Wealden strata of the Isle of Wight. A\r\nportion of the upper jaw (without teeth) was discovered some years\r\nsince in Tilgate Forest, and is deposited, with the whole of the\r\ncollection I formed at Brighton, in the gallery of organic remains\r\nof the British Museum. These three specimens are the only parts of\r\nthe jaws of the Iguanodon, with the exception of a fragment of the\r\nangular bone, that I have had the opportunity of examining. The other\r\nportions of the skeleton hitherto discovered are the following: the\r\ntympanic bone;[134] cervical, dorsal, lumbar, and caudal vertebræ,\r\nand chevron bones; ribs; the iliac bones, and sacrum composed of\r\nsix anchylosed vertebræ;[135] the coracoid, scapula and clavicles;\r\nhumerus, radius? metacarpals; femur, tibia and fibula, metatarsals\r\nand ungueals. The cranium, carpals, and tarsals, have not been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: This may or may not belong to the Iguanodon: no\r\ntympanic bone has been found in such connexion with other parts of\r\nthe skeleton as to afford certain proof that this maxillary element\r\nis referable to the Iguanodon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: In the Megalosaurus, the sacrum consists of five\r\nanchylosed vertebræ.]\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the assemblage of bones promiscuously grouped\r\ntogether in a block of _Kentish rag_ (of the greensand formation),\r\nfound in a quarry near Maidstone, by Mr. Bensted,[136] a few\r\nconnected caudal vertebræ, and two or three instances in which\r\na femur, tibia, and fibula and some metatarsals, were found in\r\ncontiguity, all the bones were isolated. They have been obtained\r\nfrom the quarries in St. Leonard's and Tilgate Forests, near\r\nLoxwood, Rusper, Horsham, Cuckfield, and Battel; and from the cliffs\r\nat Hastings, and in Sandown, and Brixton, and Brook Bays, on the\r\nsouthern shore of the Isle of Wight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: This most instructive specimen is in a glass-case\r\non the floor near the window, in the middle room of the Gallery of\r\nOrganic Remains in the British Museum. All the Wealden reptilian\r\nremains of a large size, collected by me when residing in Sussex, are\r\nin the upright glass cases in the same apartment.]\r\n\r\nSo anomalous is the osteology of the Iguanodon compared with that of\r\nexisting saurians, that from my discovery of the first vestige of\r\nthis reptile--a fragment of a tooth--thirty years ago, to the recent\r\nimportant acquisition of the jaws, I have had to contend with the\r\nopposition of eminent naturalists, who have refused assent to the\r\nphysiological inferences suggested by the specimens which were from\r\ntime to time brought to light, because the modifications of structure\r\nin a colossal herbivorous reptile, essentially differed from the\r\nhypothetical archetype skeleton of the class to which it belonged.\r\nWhen the first discovered teeth were shown to Baron Cuvier, he\r\npronounced them to be the incisors of a Rhinoceros; the metatarsals,\r\nthose of a Hippopotamus; the fragment of a femur, with a medullary\r\ncanal, that of some large mammalian. But the candour and liberality\r\nof the founder of Palæontology were worthy of his transcendent\r\ngenius; upon receiving further evidence, he immediately acknowledged\r\nthe error, and expressed his conviction that the teeth and bones\r\nbelonged to an herbivorous reptile more extraordinary than any that\r\nhad previously been brought under his notice.[137]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: See Cuvier's Ossemens Fossiles, tom. v. part. ii. It\r\nis much to be wished that those who aspire to emulate this great\r\nman in scientific fame, would also endeavour to imitate him in the\r\nyet nobler attributes of his character. It is stated by Professor\r\nOwen, in Brit. Assoc. Reports on Fossil Reptiles, that the bones\r\nof the Iguanodon were interpreted by me with the aid of Cuvier and\r\nClift. This is a mistake. Baron Cuvier died before I had obtained any\r\nconsiderable portion of the skeleton; and neither Mr. Clift nor Mr.\r\nOwen at that time could afford me any assistance in determining the\r\nnature of the isolated bones I occasionally brought to the Hunterian\r\nMuseum for comparison. Any aid I ever received in my investigations\r\nis most fully acknowledged in my works.]\r\n\r\nEven the lower jaw, which presents characters so peculiar as to\r\nadmit, as I conceive, of but one interpretation--that enunciated in\r\nmy memoir on the teeth and jaws of the Iguanodon,[138]--has been\r\nadduced as affording a signal instance of the incorrectness of my\r\nphysiological deductions. And why? Because in the entire class of\r\nliving reptiles there is not a single species that has cheeks and\r\nflexible lips, which, according to my view of the subject, the\r\nIguanodon must have possessed. But I do not hesitate to affirm\r\nthat the structure and arrangement of the teeth, and the mammalian\r\ncharacter of the bones of the extremities, are in perfect accordance\r\nwith my exposition of the probable structure and functions of the\r\nmaxillary organs of the original. The naturalists who advance these\r\nobjections, forget that among the existing mammalia there is one\r\ngenus, the _Ornithorhynchus_, or Duck-billed Platypus, that exhibits\r\nas striking a deviation from the typical maxillary structure of its\r\nclass, as does the Iguanodon. If before the discovery of New Holland\r\nthe jaw-bones of the Ornithorhynchus had been found in a fossil state\r\nin the strata of Tilgate Forest, and I had ventured to infer that the\r\noriginal, though a true mammalian, and giving suck to its young, had\r\nthe extremities of the jaws covered with flat horny beaks, like those\r\nof a duck, instead of with the fleshy lips and integuments which are\r\nthe peculiar attributes of its class, what censures would not my\r\ntemerity have called forth! We cannot too often be reminded of the\r\nprofound remark of William Penn: \"Experience, which is continually\r\ncontradicting theory, is the only test of truth.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: See Philosophical Transactions, Part II. 1848.]\r\n\r\nThe following are the physiological inferences relating to the\r\nstructure and habits of the Iguanodon, which Dr. Melville and myself\r\nconceive our investigations have established: the discovery of the\r\ncranium, and of perfect examples of the upper and lower jaws with\r\nboth successional and mature molars in their natural position, may\r\nmodify, but, we believe, will in no material respect invalidate these\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nIn instituting a comparison between the maxillary organs of the\r\nIguanodon, and those of the existing herbivorous lizards, we are at\r\nonce struck with their remarkable deviation from all known types\r\nin the class of reptiles. In the _Amblyrhynchi_ (of the Galapagos\r\nIslands), the most exclusively vegetable feeders of the Saurian\r\norder, the alveolar process beset with teeth is continued round the\r\nfront of the mouth: the junction of the two rami of the lower jaw at\r\nthe symphysis presenting no edentulous interval whatever, the lips\r\nnot being more produced than in other reptiles; but this creature\r\nonly bruises its food; it cannot grind or masticate it. In fact, the\r\nedentulous, expanded, scoop-shaped, procumbent symphysis of the lower\r\njaw of the Iguanodon, has no parallel among either recent or fossil\r\nreptiles; and we seek in vain for organs at all analogous, except\r\namong the herbivorous mammalia. The nearest approach is to be found\r\nin certain _Edentata_; as for example in the _Cholæpus didactylus_,\r\nor Two-toed Sloth, in which the anterior part of the lower jaw is\r\ndestitute of teeth, and much prolonged. The correspondence is still\r\ncloser in the extinct gigantic _Mylodons_, in which the symphysis\r\nresembles the blade of a turf-spade, and has no traces of incisor\r\nsockets; and were not this part of the jaw elevated vertically\r\nin front, and the two sides confluent, it would present the very\r\ncounterpart of that of the Iguanodon. The great number and size of\r\nthe vascular foramina distributed along the outer side of the dentary\r\nbone in the Wealden reptile, and the magnitude of the anterior\r\noutlets which gave exit to the vessels and nerves that supplied the\r\nfront of the mouth, indicate the great development of the integuments\r\nand soft parts with which the lower jaw was invested.\r\n\r\nThe sharp ridge bordering the deep groove of the symphysis, in\r\nwhich there are also several foramina, evidently gave attachment\r\nto the muscles and integuments of the under lip; and there are\r\nstrong reasons for supposing that the latter was greatly produced,\r\nand capable of being protruded and retracted so as to constitute,\r\nin conjunction with a long extensile tongue, a suitable instrument\r\nfor seizing and cropping leaves and branches, which, from the\r\nconstruction of the teeth, we may infer was the food of the Iguanodon.\r\n\r\nThus we find the mechanism of the maxillary organs of the Wealden\r\nherbivorous saurian, as demonstrated by recent discoveries, in\r\nperfect harmony with the remarkable dental characters which\r\nrendered the first known teeth so enigmatical. In the Iguanodon we\r\nhave a solution of the problem, how the integrity of the type of\r\norganization peculiar to the class of cold-blooded vertebrata was\r\nmaintained, and yet adapted by simple modifications to fulfil the\r\nconditions required by the economy of a gigantic terrestrial reptile,\r\ndestined to obtain support exclusively from vegetable substances;\r\nin like manner as the extinct colossal sloth-like Edentata of\r\nSouth America. In fine, we have in the Iguanodon the type of the\r\nterrestrial herbivora, which in that remote epoch of the earth's\r\nphysical history--the _Age of Reptiles_--occupied the same relative\r\nstation in the terrestrial fauna, and fulfilled the same general\r\npurposes in the economy of nature, as the Mylodons, Mastodons, and\r\nMammoths, of the tertiary periods, and the large pachyderms of modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nAlthough some important data are still required to complete our\r\nknowledge of the structure of the Iguanodon, we are warranted in\r\nconcluding that this colossal herbivorous reptile was as bulky as the\r\nelephant, and as massive in its proportions: for, living exclusively\r\non vegetable substances, the abdominal region must have been largely\r\ndeveloped. Its limbs must have been of proportionate size to support\r\nand move so enormous a carcass. The hinder extremities probably\r\npresented the unwieldly contour of those of the Hippopotamus, and\r\nwere based on strong short feet, protected by broad horny ungueal\r\nphalanges, or nails. The fore-legs appear to have been less bulky,\r\nand adapted for seizing and pulling down plants and branches: the\r\nteeth and jaws demonstrate the nature of its food; and the fossil\r\nremains of coniferous trees, arborescent, ferns, and cycadeous\r\nplants, with which its relics are commonly associated, indicate the\r\ncharacter of the flora adapted for its sustenance.[139]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: Philosophical Transactions, for 1848, pp. 196-198.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. The Pelorosaurus.--The humerus of a terrestrial reptile of\r\nenormous magnitude, has lately been discovered by Mr. Peter Fuller\r\nof Lewes, in the quarry near Cuckfield, from which many remains of\r\nthe Iguanodon and Hylæosaurus were obtained in my early researches.\r\nThis bone more nearly resembles the humerus of the Crocodiles, than\r\nthat of the Lizards. It Is four and a half feet in length, and of\r\ncorresponding proportions; it has a large medullary canal. As to\r\nthe size of the animal to which it belonged, while disclaiming the\r\nidea that any certain conclusion can be drawn from a single bone, I\r\nmay mention, with the view of conveying some general notion, that\r\nin a Gangetic crocodile eighteen feet long, the humerus is one\r\nfoot: according to this scale the fossil animal would be eighty-one\r\nfeet in length. I have proposed the name of _Pelorosaurus_ (from\r\nπἑλωρ--_pelòr_--monster), or Colossal-saurian, for this new genus of\r\nreptiles which Inhabited the country of the Iguanodon.[140]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: A memoir on this fossil was read before the Royal\r\nSociety, Feb. 14th, 1850; an abstract has been published in the\r\nProceedings of the Society. It is entitled, \"On the Pelorosaurus;\r\nan undescribed gigantic terrestrial reptile, whose remains are\r\nassociated with those of the Iguanodon and other saurians in the\r\nstrata of Tilgate Forest.\" It will appear in the Phil. Trans. Part\r\n11. 1850.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. Silicification, _or petrifaction by flint_.--The various forms\r\nin which silex occurs have depended on its state of fluidity. In\r\nquartz crystals the solution was complete; in agate and chalcedony\r\nit was in a gelatinous state, assuming a spheroidal or orbicular\r\ndisposition according to the motion given to its particles. Its\r\ncondition appears also to have been modified by the influence of\r\norganic matter. In some polished slices of siliceous nodules,\r\nthe transition from flint to agate, chalcedony, and crystallized\r\nquartz, is beautifully shown. The curious fact that the shells of\r\nEchinites In chalk are almost invariably filled with flint, while\r\ntheir crustaceous shells are changed into calc-spar, is probably\r\nin many instances to be attributed to the animal matter having\r\nundergone silicification; for the most organized parts are those\r\nwhich appear to have been most susceptible of this transmutation.\r\nIn some specimens the oyster is changed into flint, while the shell\r\nIs converted into crystallized carbonate of lime. In a trigonia\r\nfrom Tisbury, formerly In the cabinet of the late Miss Benett, of\r\nNorton House, near Warminster, the body of the mollusk was completely\r\nmetamorphosed into pure chalcedony, the branchiæ or gills being\r\nas clearly defined as when the animal was recent. In specimens of\r\nwood from Australia (presented to the British Museum by Sir Thomas\r\nMitchell), which are completely permeated by silex, there are on\r\nthe external surface some spots of chalcedony, that have apparently\r\noriginated from the exudation of the liquid silex from the interior\r\nin viscid globules filled with air, which burst, and then collapsed,\r\nand became solidified in their present form.\r\n\r\nIn silicified wood, the permeation of the vegetable tissues by the\r\nmineral matter appears to have been effected by solutions of silex of\r\na high temperature. In some examples mineralization has been effected\r\nsimply by replacement: the original substance has been removed, atom\r\nby atom, and the silex substituted in its place. One of the most\r\neminent naturalists and mineralogists of the United States, Mr. J.\r\nD. Dana,[141] suggests that the reason why silica is so common a\r\nmaterial in the constitution of fossil wood and shells, as well as in\r\npseudo-morphic crystals,[142] consists in the ready solution of silex\r\nin water at a high temperature (a fact affirmed by Bergman[143])\r\nunder great pressure, whenever an alkali is present, as is seen at\r\nthe present time in many volcanic regions, and its ready deposition\r\nagain when the water cools. A mere heated aqueous solution of silica,\r\nunder a high pressure, is sufficient to explain the phenomenon of\r\nthe silicification of organic structures. Mr. Dana states that \"a\r\ncrystal of calc-spar in such a fluid, being exposed to solution from\r\nthe action of the heated water alone, the silica deposits itself\r\ngradually on a reduction of temperature, and takes the place of the\r\nlime, atom by atom, as soon as set free. Every silicified fossil\r\nis an example of this pseudo-morphism; but there seems to be no\r\nunion of the silica with the lime, for silicate of lime is of rare\r\noccurrence.\"[144]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: American Journal of Science, for January, 1845.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Pseudo-morphic crystals are crystals moulded in the\r\ncavities left by other crystals, which they have replaced. See Dr.\r\nBlum on pseudo-morphous minerals; and Mr. Jefferey's experiments on\r\nthe solution of silica in heated vapour; Wonders of Geology, p. 100.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: Bergman first determined the solubility of silex in\r\nsimple water, aided by heat, and demonstrated its existence in the\r\nGeysers, and other boiling springs of Iceland. _Parkinson_, _Org.\r\nRem._, vol. i. p. 324.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: See my \"Notes on a microscopical examination of chalk\r\nand flint,\" Annals of Natural History, August 1845.]\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. Stigmaria, Sigillaria, &c.--The most remarkable peculiarity\r\nof the flora of the carboniferous period is the immense numerical\r\npreponderance of the vascular or higher tribes of cryptogamic plants,\r\nwhich amount to two-thirds of the species described. With these\r\nare associated a few Palms, Coniferæ, Cycadeæ, and dicotyledonous\r\nplants, allied to the _Cacteæ_ and _Euphorbiaceæ_. The number and\r\nmagnitude of the vegetables bearing an analogy to the _Ductulosæ_,\r\nbut differing from existing species and genera, constitute therefore\r\nthe most important botanical feature of the carboniferous flora. Thus\r\nwe have plants allied to the Equisetum, or mare's-tail (_Calamites_),\r\neighteen inches in circumference, and from thirty to forty feet high;\r\nZamia-like coniferæ (_Sigillariæ_) fifty feet high; and arborescent\r\nclub-mosses (_Lepidodendra_) attaining an altitude of sixty or\r\nseventy feet. Of this ancient flora, the fossil plants whose stems\r\nhave been named _Sigillaria_ (see Plate XXI.), and their roots\r\nStigmaria, are especially remarkable in consequence of the peculiar\r\ncircumstances under which upright examples of these trees are\r\noccasionally met with. Referring for details to \"Wonders of Geology,\"\r\nLecture VII., I purpose describing in this place the facts recently\r\nbrought to light, which prove that certain species of Stigmaria are\r\nthe roots of Sigillariæ; while others in all probability belong to\r\nLepidodendra:--an opinion maintained more than thirty years ago by\r\nthe Rev. H. Steinhauer.[145] To the late Mr. Binney we are indebted\r\nfor the first confirmation of the inference of my friend, M. Adolphe\r\nBrongniart, (derived from an examination of the structure of those\r\nbodies,) that the Stigmariæ are the veritable roots of Sigillariæ.\r\nAt St. Helen's, near Liverpool, Mr. Binney discovered, in 1844, an\r\nupright trunk of a Sigillaria, nine feet high, to which were attached\r\nten roots, several feet long, that extended into the under clay in\r\ntheir natural position;[146] and these roots were unquestionable\r\nStigmariæ, the tubercles with their attached rootlets being clearly\r\ndisplayed. In the floor of the Victoria Mine at Dunkinfold, near\r\nManchester, at the depth of 1,100 feet from the surface, Mr. Binney\r\nalso discovered a magnificent specimen of Sigillaria, which exhibited\r\non its stem the respective characters of three supposed species, and\r\nhad stigmaria-roots extending twenty feet.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: Transactions of the American Philosophical Society,\r\nNew Series, vol. i.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: See Medals of Creation, vol. i. p. 143.]\r\n\r\nIn the Sydney coal-field at Cape Breton, Mr. Richard Brown has\r\nobserved several upright stems of Sigillariæ and Lepidodendra, with\r\nstigmaria-roots attached; and the same fact has been noticed in the\r\nPicton coal, in Nova Scotia. The following figures and notes from Mr.\r\nBrown's description of these interesting phenomena, will place the\r\nsubject before the reader in a clear point of view.[147]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: \"Description of an upright Lepidodendron with\r\nStigmaria-roots in the roof of the Sydney Main Coal, in the Island of\r\nCape Breton. By Richard Brown, Esq.\"--_Geological Journal_, No. 13,\r\nfor June, 1847, p. 46.]\r\n\r\nThe main bed of coal is six feet in thickness, and is overlaid, as\r\nusual, by a roof of shale abounding in foliage and fragments of\r\nbranches. As the coal is dug out, large masses of the shale fall in,\r\nand occasionally hollow spaces, called by the workmen _pot-holes_,\r\nare left in the roof; the fallen masses being the roots and truncated\r\nstems of Sigillariæ and other trees, which separate at the parting\r\nformed by the coaly bark covering the roots, when the supporting coal\r\nis removed.\r\n\r\nThe following sketch represents one of the specimens of the base of\r\na stem of a Lepidodendron, with the roots (_stigmariæ_) attached.\r\nThis figure (1) shows the position of the tree above the bed of main\r\ncoal, with the inclination and length of two of the principal roots,\r\nso far as they could be distinctly traced; and the following sketch\r\n(2) represents the trunk, with its branching roots, constructed from\r\ncareful measurements of the dimensions and position of each root,\r\ndrawn on the spot. The stem at the part marked A, was encrusted with\r\na coaly bark, covered by the usual cicatrices of the Lepidodendra,\r\nand the roots at B, C, D, with a similar carbonaceous investment,\r\nimpressed with the characteristic pits or areolæ of Stigmariæ.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 1._\r\n\r\nSTEM OF LEPIDODENDRON WITH ROOTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 2._]\r\n\r\nIn the Instance of the upright stems of Sigillariæ in the same\r\ncoal-field, the roots were also unequivocally Stigmariæ. Fig. 3,\r\nrepresents one of these erect stems, sixteen Inches high and twelve\r\ninches in diameter at the top, which dropped from the roof of the bed\r\nafter the coal had been removed. Part of the coaly bark remains at\r\n_c_. The decorticated part of the trunk is covered with minute scales\r\nas far as the point _h_, a few inches below the first ramification of\r\nthe roots. The carbonaceous crust investing the roots was thick at\r\nthe upper part, but gradually became thin, and at _a_, and _b_, was a\r\nmere friable pellicle, that fell off upon the slightest touch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 3._\r\n\r\nSTEM OF SIGILLARIA ALTERNANS, 1/12 _natural size_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 4._]\r\n\r\nThe exact position of the tree in relation to the underlying coal is\r\nshown in the above section. Fig. 4. Immediately over the coal there\r\nis a bed of hard shale, six inches in depth, in which no fossils are\r\nfound; this is overlaid by a softer shale abounding in coal-plants;\r\nall the upright stems were rooted in the six-inch shale. Upon\r\nclearing the base of this tree, a complete set of conical tap-roots\r\nwas discovered, arranged as in the annexed sketch. Fig. 5. There are\r\nfour large tap-roots in each quarter of the stump, and five inches\r\nbelow these another set of smaller tap-roots; the total number\r\namounting to eighteen. The horizontal roots are seen to branch off in\r\na regular manner, the base being divided into four nearly equal parts\r\nby deep channels, extending from the centre to the points _i, k, l,\r\nm_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 5._\r\n\r\n_The under surface of Fig. 3, showing the conical tap-roots of the\r\ntree, 1/12 natural size._]\r\n\r\nMr. Brown remarks, that these short thick tap-roots were evidently\r\nadapted only to a soft wet soil, such as we may conceive was the\r\nnature of the first layer of mud deposited upon a bed of peat\r\nwhich had settled down slightly below the level of the water. He\r\nsupposes, from the presence of a layer of shale without fossil plants\r\nimmediately over the coal, that the prostrate stems and leaves which\r\noccur in such large quantities in the next superincumbent bed, fell\r\nfrom trees growing on the spot, and were entombed in layers of mud\r\nheld in suspension in the water, which at short intervals inundated\r\nthe low marshy ground on which they grew; for had the plants been\r\ndrifted from a distance, he conceives they would also occur in the\r\nfirst layer of shale, as well as in those higher up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 6._\r\n\r\nSTEM OF A SIGILLARIA BROKEN OFF CLOSE TO THE ROOTS, 1/12 _natural\r\nsize_.]\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown that the _Sigillaria alternans_ was provided\r\nwith roots adapted for a soft muddy soil, Mr. Brown next describes\r\nthe specimen represented in Fig. 6, which is the stem of the same\r\nspecies of tree broken off near the roots; the hollow cylinder of\r\nbark (_a_) having been bent down and doubled over by the pressure\r\nof the surrounding mud, so as effectually to close up the aperture,\r\nleaving only a few irregular cicatrices, of three or four inches\r\nin length, converging at the apex; the structure, arrangement, and\r\nnumber of the tap-roots, as well as the horizontal ramifications, are\r\nsimilar to those in Fig. 5. This fossil clearly explains the nature\r\nof the \"_dome-shaped_\" plant figured in the \"Fossil Flora of Great\r\nBritain.\"[148]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: The figures 3, 4, 5, 6, and the descriptions, are from\r\nthe paper of Richard Brown, Esq., published in the Journal of the\r\nGeological Society of London, for March, 1849, entitled, \"Description\r\nof erect Sigillariæ, with conical tap-roots, found in the roof of the\r\nSydney Main Coal, in the Island of Cape Breton.\"]\r\n\r\n\"The roots of the preceding fossils repeatedly ramify as their\r\ndistance from the stem increases, and ultimately terminate in broad\r\nflattened points. The whole of the spreading roots of these trees\r\n(the _Sigillariæ_) cover only an area of thirty square feet each;\r\nwhilst those of the Lepidodendron (Fig. 1), whose stem is only two\r\nor three inches larger in diameter, covered a space of two hundred\r\nsquare feet. Since it is well known, from numerous examples, that\r\nthe Lepidodendra were lofty trees, with spreading branches, which\r\ntherefore required wide bases for support, may we not conclude that\r\nSigillariæ of the species described were, on the contrary, trees of\r\nlow stature, without heavy branches?\"\r\n\r\nI cannot quit this subject without again adverting to the remarkable\r\nphenomenon mentioned In a previous note, namely, that in the bed of\r\npulverulent earth--the _under-clay_--on which the coal invariably\r\nreposes, the roots (or Stigmariæ) of large trees are generally the\r\nonly organic remains met with. The constant occurrence of these\r\nfossils in the under-clay, and their rarity in the coal and shale,\r\nwas long ago pointed out by Mr. Martin, Dr. Macculloch, and other\r\ngeologists; but the importance of the fact was not appreciated till\r\nMr. Logan drew attention to it. In the Welsh coal-field, through a\r\ndepth of 1,200 feet, there are sixty beds of coal, each of which lies\r\non a stratum of clay abounding in Stigmariæ. In the Appalachian coal\r\nformation of the United States, the same phenomena occur.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that the under-clay is the natural soil in which\r\nthe roots (_Stigmariæ_) of the Sigillariæ and Lepidodendra grew;\r\nthe coal above it is composed of the carbonized stems and foliage\r\nof those trees; and the roof or coal-shale is formed by the\r\nleaves and branches of a forest overwhelmed and buried beneath\r\nthe transported detritus of distant rocks. These phenomena may be\r\nexplained by supposing that a plain, densely clothed with a luxuriant\r\nintertropical vegetation, was either inundated by an irruption\r\nof the sea, or overwhelmed by a flood, from the sudden breaking\r\nup of the barrier of an inland lake; or by the subsidence of the\r\ncountry on which the forests grew. But when we find an uninterrupted\r\nseries, in which triple deposits of this character are repeated\r\nthrough many thousand feet, the solution of the problem is beset\r\nwith difficulties, which the hypothesis of repeated periodical\r\nsubsidences, however ingenious, does not, in my opinion, remove.[149]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 149: See Wonders of Geology, pp. 669, 718, 731.]\r\n\r\n∵ Jaw of the Iguanodon.--_Additional note to_ p. 194.--Since\r\nthe preceding pages were struck off, I have, through the kindness\r\nand liberality of Samuel H. Beckles, Esq., of Hastings, obtained\r\ntwo portions of jaws from the Wealden of the Sussex Coast. One of\r\nthese is a fragment of the left side of the lower jaw, with six\r\nwell-defined dental sockets; the other specimen exhibits the position\r\nof the mature molars and the successional teeth in the upper jaw;\r\nand confirms the accuracy of the views of Dr. Melville and myself as\r\nto the ruminant character of the arrangement of the dental organs in\r\nthe upper and lower jaws of the Iguanodon, as described in my memoir\r\non the structure of the jaws and teeth; Philos. Trans. 1848, p. 183.\r\nWhen this specimen is completely developed, it will probably exhibit\r\ndistinctly the relative position of the germs and mature teeth, and\r\nthe form of the inner alveolar parapet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A.\r\n\r\n  Acrodus, tooth of, 160.\r\n  Actinocrinus, 121.\r\n  ---- triacontadactylus, 121.\r\n  Adelosina, 143.\r\n  Age of reptiles, 193.\r\n  Alethopteris decurrens, 81.\r\n  ---- lonchitidis, 25.\r\n  ---- Serlii, 25.\r\n  Algæ, fossil, 191.\r\n  Alveolina elliptica, 142.\r\n  Ammonites, 139.\r\n  ---- latus, 139.\r\n  ---- Mantelli, 139.\r\n  ---- ovalis, 139.\r\n  ---- Walcotii, 139.\r\n  Ananchytes ovatus, 127.\r\n  Annularia brevifolia, 27.\r\n  Anoplotherium commune, teeth of, 163.\r\n  Antarctic ocean, diatomaceæ of, 191.\r\n  Aphyllum asperum, 69.\r\n  ---- cristatum, 65.\r\n  Apiocrinus ellipticus, 113.\r\n  ---- Parkinsoni, 119.\r\n  ---- rotundus, 119.\r\n  Aptychus, 147.\r\n  Area, fossil, 144.\r\n  Artis, Mr., on fossil botany, 175.\r\n  ---- work of, 16.\r\n  Asaphus caudatus, 156.\r\n  Aspidiaria cristata, 65.\r\n  Asterias, fossil, 125.\r\n  Asterophyllites, 27.\r\n  Astrea ananas, 93.\r\n  ---- arachnoides, 95.\r\n  ---- geometrica, 109.\r\n  ---- Tisburiensis, 95.\r\n  ---- undulata, 95.\r\n\r\n\r\n  B.\r\n\r\n  Baculites Fraujasii, 139.\r\n  Bahia Blanca, fossils of, 184.\r\n  Bears, fossil teeth of, 165.\r\n  ---- fossil, 169.\r\n  Beckles, S.
