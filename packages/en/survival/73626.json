How curious to\r\nwatch in the early spring the proceedings of those busy basket-making\r\nbirds, the rooks! Rude and clumsy as their nests may at first appear, it\r\nis just the sort of workmanship best calculated for their wants. They do\r\nnot, indeed, choose the smooth and flexible osier-twigs which we should\r\nthink necessary for basket-making, but they contrive by means of\r\nbrittle, dead, forked sticks, to plait together a strong bristling\r\nout-work, within which they interweave a finer basket-work of fibrous\r\nroots, rude indeed, but not inelegant or unsuitable. Then, among birds\r\nand insects too, what persevering and industrious carpenters, masons,\r\ntailors, miners, and weavers may we not find. Perhaps there are not many\r\npersons who have watched the mason-wasps boring their galleries in brick\r\nor sand, or building the round towers which serve them as out-works; nor\r\nthe mason-bee, as she plasters together her neat mud-wall cottage or\r\ncell, as the future habitation of her young; but there are few persons\r\nunacquainted with the masonry of the chimney swallow, or of the\r\nhouse-martin twittering on the eaves. With no other tools than those\r\nwhich nature supplies, how cleverly do these creatures shape and mould\r\ntheir nests into the required form, using for their work a mortar\r\ncarefully prepared by their own labour and skill, and just of the\r\nconsistency required. Few, again, may have had an opportunity of seeing\r\ncarpenter-bees boring holes in posts or palings, and forming their\r\nsmoothly chiselled cells, or of inspecting the partitioned galleries dug\r\nout in old timber by carpenter-wasps; but perhaps many persons have\r\nobserved the colonies of emmets, or carpenter-ants, working in the\r\ntrunks of decaying oak or willow trees; or they may have listened to\r\nthat interesting carpenter-bird, the wood-pecker, tapping and boring\r\ninto trees, in pursuit of insects, and for the purpose of making a\r\nnesting-place for its young. Most of us know only by hearsay that there\r\nare tailor-birds, common enough in American orchards, who sew together\r\nbroad pieces of grass to make their nests, working them through and\r\nthrough, as if actually done with a needle; but almost every one can say\r\nfrom his own knowledge, that there are weaver-birds, such as our common\r\nhedge-sparrow and chaffinch, who weave a circular piece of haircloth for\r\nthe interior of their nests, each hair being collected and interwoven\r\nsingly, and always bent so as to lie smoothly in the hollow of the nest.\r\nThen who shall describe all the wondrous proceedings of tent-making\r\ncaterpillars, upholsterer-bees, turret-building ants, net-making\r\nspiders, paper and card-making wasps, and spinning worms? Volumes have\r\nbeen written, and volumes might still be written on the history of these\r\ncreatures. Any one possessing a garden, and taking delight therein, has\r\nample opportunity of watching the habits of birds and insects, and of\r\nconfirming, if not of adding to, the accounts given by naturalists, of\r\nthe commoner species. But we must still be indebted to the patient\r\nobservations of those who have made insects or birds their especial\r\nstudy, for many of the most curious particulars, and for all our\r\nknowledge of rare or foreign species.\r\n\r\nInteresting as is the whole subject of bird and insect manufactures,\r\nthere is one department in which we are more concerned than the rest;\r\nnamely, that in which the product can be applied to our own use, either\r\nin the way of food or clothing. Now this department is supplied wholly\r\nby insects, no bird, that we are aware of, producing by its own\r\nmanufacturing powers, any substance that can be so employed, unless,\r\nindeed, we except the curious edible nests of the Java swallow, which\r\nhave been converted by the taste of oriental epicures into an article of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\nLet us then proceed to notice such of the insect manufactures as are\r\nuseful to man, and trace, at the same time, the history and performances\r\nof these small but not insignificant manufacturers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Butterflies]]\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n         MANUFACTURE OF SILK BY CATERPILLARS OF VARIOUS KINDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important of all the insect manufactures is doubtless that of\r\nsilk-spinning. It seems almost past belief that the magnificent velvets,\r\nsatins, and silks which form so elegant a part of female attire, and\r\nwhich are heaped together in such costly profusion in the shops of the\r\nmetropolis, and in those of all considerable towns, whether in our own,\r\nor in foreign countries—that these splendid fabrics, together with all\r\nribbons, gauzes, damasks, or other articles composed of silk, should owe\r\nthe raw material of which they are formed to the labours of a race of\r\nlittle creeping caterpillars, which in this their early and imperfect\r\nstate spin for themselves cocoons, or cases of silk, where they may\r\nquietly undergo their changes until they become perfect winged insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CATERPILLAR SUSPENDED BY ITS SILKEN THREAD.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe astonishing task of supplying silk for the whole civilized world is\r\nperformed almost without exception by the common silkworm, or\r\ncaterpillar of the mulberry-tree moth. But it must not be supposed that\r\nthis is the only silk-producing insect. On the contrary, all the\r\ncaterpillars of butterflies and moths have the power of spinning a\r\ncertain quantity of silken thread, however small, and however inferior\r\nto that of the silkworm, properly so called. It is very common in\r\ngardens to see numbers of caterpillars dangling by their silken threads\r\nfrom the young branches of fruit-trees. In this way they let themselves\r\ndown, or break their fall if blown off by the wind, or otherwise shaken\r\nfrom their favourite tree. And in the case of some caterpillars when the\r\ninsect has completed the term of its existence and becomes a chrysalis,\r\nit suspends itself by silken cords to some fixed point, where it remains\r\nin complete repose, without food, perhaps for months before the perfect\r\nwinged insect bursts forth, as different a creature from the caterpillar\r\nas the chrysalis is from either,—and yet these are but three different\r\nstates of existence of the same insect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHRYSALIS SUSPENDED BY SILKEN CORDS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAccording to the particular species of caterpillar, the silk will vary\r\nin strength and fineness, and also in colour, but seldom will it be\r\nfound strong enough, or in sufficient quantity to be of use to us. The\r\ninsects themselves employ it in many ways for their own safety and\r\nshelter. How common it is to find some of the leaves of a lilac-tree\r\nmade up into little rolls, or folded together at their edges, where they\r\nstick so fast that it requires some little force to pull them asunder.\r\nThis is the work of a small caterpillar, whose subsistence is found on\r\nthat tree. A single egg has been laid on each leaf selected by the\r\nparent moth, and soon after it is hatched, the caterpillar begins\r\nrolling up the lilac leaf, and fastening the edges with silk. This is a\r\nwork of time, but gradually proceeds as the caterpillar increases in\r\nstrength, until at last it is shut up in a gallery of its own making,\r\nsafe from the attacks of birds and larger insects. The leaves of various\r\nother trees are rolled in a somewhat similar manner, as those of the\r\noak, the willow, and the rose, and also those of humbler plants, as the\r\nplantain, nettle, thistle, &c. The mode in which these leaf-rolling\r\ncaterpillars set to work to form convenient habitations of the leaves of\r\nthe plants on which they feed, is well described by Kirby and Spence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OAK LEAF ROLLED BY A CATERPILLAR.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Some of these merely connect together with a few silken threads several\r\nleaves, so as to form an irregular packet, in the centre of which the\r\nlittle hermit lives. Others confine themselves to a single leaf, of\r\nwhich they simply fold one part over the other. A third description form\r\nand inhabit a sort of roll, by some species made cylindrical, by others\r\nconical, resembling the papers in which grocers put their sugar, and as\r\naccurately constructed; only there is an opening left at the smaller\r\nextremity for the egress of the insect in case of need. If you were to\r\nsee one of these rolls, you would immediately ask by what mechanism it\r\ncould possibly be made—how an insect, without fingers, could contrive to\r\nbend a leaf into a roll, and to keep it in that form until fastened with\r\nthe silk which holds it together? The following is the operation: the\r\nlittle caterpillar first fixes a series of silken cables from one side\r\nof the leaf to the other: she next pulls at these cables with her feet;\r\nand when she has forced the sides to approach, she fastens them together\r\nwith stronger threads of silk. If the insect finds that one of the\r\nlarger nerves of the leaf is so strong as to resist her efforts, she\r\nweakens it by gnawing it here and there half through. What engineer\r\ncould act more sagaciously? To form one of the conical or horn-shaped\r\nrolls, which are not composed of a whole leaf, but of a long triangular\r\nportion cut out of the edge, some other manœuvres are requisite. Placing\r\nherself upon the leaf, the caterpillar cuts out with her jaws the piece\r\nwhich is to compose her roll. She does not, however, entirely detach it;\r\nit would then want a base. She detaches that part only which is to form\r\nthe contour of the horn. This portion is a triangular strap, which she\r\nrolls as she cuts. When the body of the horn is finished, as it is\r\nintended to be fixed upon the leaf in nearly an upright position, it is\r\nnecessary to elevate it. To effect this, she proceeds as we should with\r\nan inclined obelisk. She attaches threads, or little cables, towards the\r\npoint of the pyramid, and raises it by the weight of her body.”\r\n\r\nOther larvæ form their habitations wholly of silk: one that inhabits the\r\nleaves of pear-trees forms a little tent; another a sort of cloak;\r\nanother, as in the case of the silkworm, a complete ball of silk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PENDULOUS NESTS OF CATERPILLARS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong leaf-rolling caterpillars, one of the most curious is described by\r\nBonnet, in which the nest hangs suspended from the branch of a\r\nfruit-tree by a strong silken thread. It is formed of one or two leaves\r\nneatly folded and fastened together with silk, and in this small\r\nenclosure several caterpillars live harmoniously together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LEAF CUTTING CATERPILLAR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere is also a very curious and beautiful nest formed by a rare insect,\r\nwhich has only yet been observed in its caterpillar state; but its\r\nproceedings therein are interesting and highly remarkable. The length of\r\nthe body in this caterpillar varies from six to eight inches, the\r\nthickness is half a line. The general colour is bluish green, tending to\r\nyellow about the head; the feet are black, and six in number. At the\r\nextremity of the body are two points projecting sideways. The eyes are\r\nvisible and prominent in this caterpillar, and besides the antennæ there\r\nare two or three pairs of palpi or feelers, which perform the office of\r\nhands. This insect inhabits the nut-tree, and cuts out from its leaves a\r\nmost ingenious case, which serves for its dwelling-place. This case is\r\nof a singular form, being an elongated cone, very narrow at the\r\nextremity, and tolerably wide at the orifice. It is formed of a strip of\r\nnut-leaf, wound up in a spiral manner, but so cleverly contrived that\r\nthe strip is very narrow at the extremity, and gradually widens as the\r\nwork proceeds. This happens from the gradual progress of the work, which\r\nis begun in the early stage of the caterpillar’s existence, when it does\r\nnot require a large dwelling-place, and becomes more and more extended\r\nto suit the growth of its inmate. When it is completed, it is rather\r\nmore than an inch long, and two lines in diameter at the orifice. The\r\noutside of the case presents the upper surface of the leaf in which the\r\nindentations are preserved. The dwelling is a spacious one for the\r\ncaterpillar, so that it can turn round in it with perfect ease. The band\r\nof which the cone is composed is taken from the edge of the leaf, which\r\nthe caterpillar cuts away in proportion as it winds it round its own\r\nbody. When one portion has taken the required form, a little more is cut\r\nout, but always in a direction parallel with the edge of the leaf. While\r\nthe insect is thus gradually rolling itself up in a case, it also feeds\r\nvigorously on the leaf, taking care, however, always to spare the band\r\nwhich forms its habitation. Another part of the cleverness of this\r\ninsect consists in maintaining this strip of leaf in its spiral form,\r\nwhich would otherwise naturally unwind by its own weight, and flutter in\r\nthe wind as a torn fragment. Here it is that silk is again skilfully\r\nemployed. The caterpillar commences much as other leaf-rolling insects\r\ndo, by fastening a thread to the edge of the leaf and drawing it towards\r\nthe desired point. But as the work proceeds the insect generally has\r\nthree skeins or bands of silk extended from the opening of its case to\r\nthe leaf. The first is the shortest and the most direct, issuing from\r\nthe interior of the roll; the second is fastened to the middle of the\r\nlast spiral, and extends to the leaf; the third is more extensive still,\r\nand all three are admirably disposed for keeping the leaf bent to the\r\nproper form. These skeins are composed of a great number of threads\r\nparallel with each other, which not only serve to retain the leaf in its\r\nspiral form, but also serve the caterpillar as a kind of ladder, by\r\nwhich it mounts, and on which it rests while cutting out fresh portions\r\nof leaf.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LEAF-NEST UNWOUND.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens accidentally to this caterpillar that the case\r\nbecomes detached from the leaf, or naturalists have purposely severed a\r\nportion to see what would be the result; but this does not greatly\r\ndisturb the insect, for as long as a single thread of silk remains to\r\nhold the pieces together, the caterpillar is able to repair the evil. It\r\nwill unite the fractured portion almost imperceptibly by means of silken\r\nthreads, and proceed with its case as before; but if the leaf dry up and\r\nwither, the insect is then compelled to desert it, and to select a\r\nyounger and fresher leaf for its operations.\r\n\r\nWhat is still more curious, on the completion of the dwelling, the\r\ncaterpillar sometimes wishes to make an excursion to another part of the\r\nleaf, and to take its house with it, and this it accomplishes in the\r\nfollowing manner. Coming more than three parts out of the cone, the\r\ncreature makes new skeins in advance of the old, and attempts to pull\r\nthe cone forward by their means; but finding that this does not succeed,\r\nit bends its body back, and quickly severs the old threads and the\r\nportion of leaf which keeps the case immovable. It is now able to draw\r\nthe case onwards a certain distance, after which it has only to repeat\r\nthe operation, and make other new skeins in advance of these, to\r\ncontinue its onward journey. Thus it arrives at the opposite edge of the\r\nleaf, where it carefully adjusts its case to the under side, fastening\r\nit with great ingenuity, and drawing the threads tighter where the cone\r\nis not properly balanced. In all these cases, silk is the useful\r\nmaterial by which the caterpillar secures its nest, and provides for its\r\nown safety: it is also a constant resource in case of danger, or of\r\naccident, as the following anecdote will show. A caterpillar of the\r\ngoat-moth, being confined in a smooth glass sugar-basin, managed to\r\ncrawl up the slippery sides and escape. This excited great surprise in\r\nthe naturalist (Rösel) who had imprisoned the creature, and he therefore\r\ntook occasion closely to watch its proceedings when again placed in a\r\nsimilar vessel. It was with surprise and admiration that he now saw the\r\ncaterpillar constructing a silken ladder on the side of the glass; the\r\nnatural gum of the silk being sufficient to secure it even to that\r\nperfectly smooth surface. Up this ladder the creature crawled, and thus\r\neasily and expeditiously made its escape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SILKEN LADDER SPUN BY THE GOAT-MOTH CATERPILLAR.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSilkworms abound in our own country, as well as in others; but the silk\r\nthey spin is too fragile and scanty to be employed for other purposes\r\nthan their own. It is different with some of the caterpillars of India.\r\nAlthough the great supply of silk is there obtained, as with us, from\r\nthe silkworm of the mulberry-tree, yet the caterpillars of various moths\r\nalso furnish a considerable quantity. The most important of these are\r\nthe _Tusseh_ and _Arindy_ silkworms, both natives of Bengal. The first\r\nfeeds on the leaves of the jujube tree and of the asseen, and is found\r\nin such abundance as from time immemorial to have afforded a constant\r\nsupply of coarse, dark-coloured silk, which is woven into a cheap but\r\nvery durable cloth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE TUSSEH SILKWORM.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillars approach their full size they are too heavy to\r\ncrawl in search of their food with the back upwards, as is usual with\r\nmost caterpillars, but traverse the small branches suspended by the\r\nfeet, as is shown in the figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COCOON OF THE TUSSEH SILKWORM.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillar is ready to spin its cocoon, it connects by means\r\nof the silk, (which is always glutinous when newly spun,) two or three\r\nnew leaves into an outer envelope, which serves as a basis to spin the\r\ncomplete cocoon in, besides the cocoon being suspended from a branch of\r\nthe tree in a wonderful manner, by a thick, strong, consolidated cord,\r\nspun of the same material by this persevering creature.\r\n\r\nThe cocoon is of an exact oval shape, and very firm in texture: in it\r\nthe animal remains dormant, and perfectly protected, for about nine\r\nmonths, namely from October until July; so that it makes its appearance\r\nin time for the caterpillars to come into existence, when Providence has\r\nfurnished them with the greatest plenty of proper food. When the insect\r\nis prepared to make its escape and be changed into its perfect state, it\r\ndischarges from its mouth a large quantity of liquid, with which the\r\nupper end of the case is so perfectly softened as to enable the moth to\r\nwork its way out in a very short time; an operation which is always\r\nperformed during the night. In their perfect state these insects do not\r\nexist many days: the female deposits her eggs in the branches of the\r\ntree she may be resting on, to which they adhere firmly by means of the\r\ngluten they are covered with when newly laid.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are white, round, and compressed, with a depression in the\r\ncentre on each side. They hatch in from two to four weeks, according to\r\nthe state of the weather. The _larvæ_ or caterpillars acquire their full\r\nsize, which is about four inches in length, and three in circumference,\r\nin about six weeks: they are nearly the colour of the leaves they feed\r\non, with a light yellowish stripe on each side; under these stripes the\r\nmiddle segments are marked with an oblong gold-coloured speck. The back\r\nis also marked with a few round darker coloured spots, from which issue\r\na few long, coarse, distinct hairs, while others of smaller size are\r\nscattered over the insect.\r\n\r\nThe Tusseh silkworm is found in such abundance over many parts of Bengal\r\nand the adjoining provinces, as to afford to the natives a large supply\r\nof the durable, coarse, dark-coloured silk, already mentioned, commonly\r\ncalled Tusseh silk, which is woven into a kind of cloth called Tusseh\r\ndoot’hies, much worn by Brahmins and other sects of Hindoos. This\r\nsubstance would no doubt be highly useful to the inhabitants of many\r\nparts of America and the south of Europe, where a cheap, light, cool,\r\ndurable dress, such as this silk makes, is much wanted. Millions of\r\ncocoons of the Tusseh silkworm are annually collected in the jungle, and\r\nbrought to the silk factories near Calcutta. In other parts the people\r\ngather and transplant them to the trees near their own dwellings, that\r\nthey may watch over the safety of the caterpillars, which are very\r\nliable to be devoured by crows during the day time, and by bats at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThe Arindy silkworm feeds only on the leaves of the Palmi Christi; it\r\nproduces so delicate and flossy a silk that it cannot be wound from the\r\ncocoons; it is therefore spun like cotton, and the thread woven into a\r\ncoarse kind of white cloth, of a loose texture, but so durable that a\r\nperson can scarcely in his lifetime wear out a garment made of it.\r\n\r\nEleven different species of silkworm have been enumerated as natives of\r\nIndia, which has thus the internal means of providing the whole of\r\nEurope with a material which would rival cotton and woollen cloth, and\r\nwould often be preferred to both, could it be obtained at a low price.\r\nThe produce of the Arindy silkworm, when sent to this country was much\r\nadmired, and some manufacturers to whom it was shown seemed to think\r\nthat they had been hitherto deceived in the account of the shawls of\r\nIndia being made from the wool of a goat, and that this silk, if sent\r\nhome, could be made into shawls equal to any manufactured in India.\r\n\r\nMany of the larvæ of the European moths afford a very strong silk, and\r\nit is said, that a manufacture of silk from the cocoons of the emperor\r\nmoth was at one time established in Germany. There is no doubt, however,\r\nthat silk might be collected in abundance from many native silkworms in\r\nAmerica. Cocoons have been described eight inches long, made of grey\r\nsilk, which the inhabitants of Chilpancingo, Tixtala, and other places\r\nin South America, manufacture into stockings and handkerchiefs. Humboldt\r\nalso observed similar nests in the provinces of Mechoacan, and the\r\nmountains of Santa Rosa; they were of dense tissue, resembling Chinese\r\npaper, of a brilliant whiteness, and formed of distinct and separate\r\nlayers. The interior layers, which are the thinnest, and of\r\nextraordinary transparency, were used by the ancient Mexicans as writing\r\ntablets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                  MANUFACTURE OF SILK BY THE SILKWORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the most important of all silk-spinning insects, the\r\ncommon silkworm, or caterpillar of the mulberry-tree moth. The labours\r\nof this insect were known and appreciated in other parts of the world\r\nlong before we had tidings of its existence; so that the peasantry of\r\nother lands were clad in raiment which our kings would have been proud\r\nto wear. “When silk was so scarce in this country that James the First,\r\nwhile King of Scotland, was forced to beg of the Earl of Mar the loan of\r\na pair of silk stockings to appear in before the English ambassador,\r\nenforcing his request with the cogent appeal, ‘for ye would not, sure,\r\nthat your king should appear as a scrub before strangers;’ nay, long\r\nbefore this period, even prior to the time that silk was valued at its\r\nweight in gold at Rome, and the Emperor Aurelian refused his empress a\r\nrobe of silk because of its dearness, the Chinese peasantry in some of\r\nthe provinces, millions in number, were clothed with this material; and\r\nfor some thousand years to the present time, it has been both there and\r\nin India (where a class whose occupation was to attend silkworms appears\r\nto have existed from time immemorial, being mentioned in the oldest\r\nSanscrit books,) one of the chief objects of cultivation and\r\nmanufacture. You will admit, therefore, that when nature\r\n\r\n               ——Set to work millions of spinning worms,\r\n         That in their green shops weave the smooth-haired silk\r\n         To deck her sons,\r\n\r\nshe was conferring upon them a benefit scarcely inferior to that\r\nconsequent upon the gift of wool to the fleecy race, or a fibrous rind\r\nto the flax or hemp plants; and that mankind is not under much less\r\nobligation to Pamphila, who, according to Aristotle, was the discoverer\r\nof the art of unwinding and weaving silk, than to the inventors of the\r\nspinning of those products.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  EGGS AND SILKWORMS IN THE FIRST AGE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is so common an amusement with young persons in this country to\r\nprocure the eggs of silkworms, rear the insects, and watch their changes\r\nthat numbers are acquainted with the growth, habits, and manner of\r\nspinning of these interesting creatures. Perhaps a sheet of paper is\r\ngiven to a little boy or girl, on which are a number of small specks, no\r\nbigger than pins’ heads: these specks, the child is told, are silkworms’\r\neggs, and if he keeps them dry during winter, and then places them in a\r\nsunny window in spring, he will get a number of caterpillars from them.\r\nTaking care to do this, the child is delighted some fine morning to see\r\na few little dark coloured worms crawling about the paper, while others\r\nare just issuing from the eggs. Perhaps a difficulty now arises about\r\ntheir food. In warm countries the leaves of the mulberry-tree are ready\r\nfor the insects as soon as they are hatched; but in England, unless the\r\neggs are purposely kept back, by putting them in a cold place, the\r\ncaterpillars come out before the mulberry-tree has put forth its leaves.\r\nA few tender leaves of the lettuce are therefore spread lightly over the\r\nyoung caterpillars, and upon these they mount, and at last begin to\r\nfeed, after searching in vain for their natural food. But the worms do\r\nnot thrive on this diet, and it is much better so to manage the eggs\r\nthat they may be hatched when the young leaves of the mulberry are just\r\nopening. These form the best possible food in that tender state, and in\r\norder to economise it, the leaves should be cut in small pieces; because\r\nthe caterpillars feed only on the edges, and thus great part of a leaf,\r\nwhen given to them whole, is entirely wasted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE WHITE MULBERRY.\r\n\r\n  (_Morus alba._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn Italy, where great attention is paid to the cultivation of the\r\nsilkworm, the eggs are hatched in a room heated by a stove, and the\r\nyoung caterpillars are then removed on their mulberry-leaves to a cooler\r\napartment called the nursery, where they are managed with great care and\r\nskill. Wicker shelves are arranged in the room at convenient distances,\r\nand are lined with paper, on which the worms are placed. Care is taken\r\nto place together only such worms as are hatched at the same time, for\r\nwithout this precaution the treatment, with respect to food, could not\r\nbe regulated, and the moultings would not take place at the same time.\r\nGreat care is also taken to secure the worms from rats and mice, as well\r\nas from certain insect enemies.\r\n\r\nSilkworms are so little disposed to wander away from their food that\r\nopen trays are sufficient to secure them: but unless great cleanliness\r\nis observed in their management, and frequent change of food given, a\r\nsickly smell is observed, and the caterpillars languish and die in great\r\nnumbers. Supposing the young brood goes on well, and is properly\r\nattended by the child whom we have supposed to undertake the charge,\r\nthere will be about five or six days’ feeding, and then the worms will\r\nbegin to sicken for their first moult, or casting the skin. Silkworms\r\nhave four of these moults, at each of which they appear to suffer pain\r\nor inconvenience; they also entirely leave off eating for two or three\r\ndays. The caterpillars at that time raise the fore part of their bodies,\r\nand show tokens of uneasiness. They have grown rapidly, and their skins,\r\nnot having grown in proportion, now appear to press and inconvenience\r\nthem; but after two or three days fasting, they become thinner and are\r\nable gradually to rid themselves of their skin. It is now that their\r\nowner may see the use they begin to make of their silk. By watching them\r\nclosely he sees each caterpillar throw out a number of very fine silken\r\nlines, by which it fastens the skin to one spot. Having done this, it is\r\nable to creep out, without dragging the skin about after it, as would\r\notherwise be the case. In this operation the whole covering of the body,\r\nincluding that of the feet, of the jaws and teeth, is cast off; but it\r\nsometimes happens that the animal cannot entirely cast its skin, a\r\nportion of it breaking and remaining attached to the extremity of the\r\nbody. As the animal increases rapidly in size, this portion of the old\r\nskin compresses its body tightly, causing inflammation and much\r\nsuffering, which usually ends in death.\r\n\r\nWorms that have newly moulted are readily distinguished by their pale\r\ncolour, and the wrinkled appearance of the new skin. Soon after moulting\r\nthey recover health and vigour, and feed with increased appetite. To\r\nkeep them in health they must be fed with great regularity, and not\r\ncrowded together in their trays. In the course of five days the rapid\r\ngrowth of the insect causes the wrinkles to disappear from the skin; it\r\nis now half an inch in length; a second sickness, and a second moulting,\r\nprepare it for increase of growth; it casts its skin as before, and\r\nfeeds without intermission during another five days, during which time\r\nit attains a length of three quarters of an inch. It then falls sick and\r\nmoults a third time. It again feeds during five days, after which it\r\ncasts its skin for the fourth and last time in the caterpillar state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  PROGRESSIVE GROWTH OF THE SILKWORM.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is now about one and a half or two inches in length, and devours its\r\nfood most voraciously, increasing rapidly in size during ten days. When\r\nthe worms are fed a slight hissing noise is heard similar to that of\r\ngreen wood burning. According to some writers this noise proceeds from\r\nthe action of the jaws, but others attribute it solely to the action of\r\nthe feet, which are continually moving until the worms have fastened to\r\ntheir food, when the noise ceases. In a large nursery of silkworms this\r\nnoise sounds like a soft shower of rain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SILKWORM ON MULBERRY-LEAF.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the caterpillar has attained its full growth, it is a very\r\ndifferent creature from the little black worm which first issued from\r\nthe egg, being from two and a half to three inches in length, and its\r\nbody consisting of twelve membranous rings, which contract and elongate\r\nas the animal moves. It is furnished with sixteen legs, in pairs: three\r\npairs in front, under the first three rings, are covered with a shelly\r\nor scaly substance; the other five pairs, called holders, are furnished\r\nwith little hooks, which assist the insect in climbing. The head is\r\ncovered with a scaly substance similar to the covering of the fore legs.\r\nThe mandibles are of great strength, and indented like the teeth of a\r\nsaw. Beneath the jaw are two small openings, through which the insect\r\ndraws its silken lines. The substance of which the silk is composed is a\r\nfine yellow transparent gum, secreted in two slender vessels, “which are\r\nwound, as it were, on two spindles in the stomach; if unfolded, these\r\nvessels would be about ten inches in length.” The insect breathes by\r\nmeans of eighteen holes or spiracles, distributed along the body, nine\r\non each side. On each side of the head, near the mouth, are seven small\r\neyes; the two specks higher up on the head, which are generally mistaken\r\nfor eyes, are only parts of the skull.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FULL GROWN SILKWORM.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhen the silkworm is ready to spin, it gets upon the leaves without\r\neating them, rears its head as if in search of something, or crawls to\r\nthe edges of the tray and moves slowly along; its rings draw in, and its\r\ngreenish colour changes to a deep golden hue; its skin becomes wrinkled\r\nabout the neck, and its body feels like soft dough, and on taking it in\r\nthe hand, and looking through it, the whole body has assumed the\r\ntransparency of a ripe yellow plum. When this is observed, the owner of\r\nthe insects puts each singly into a little cone of white paper, which he\r\npins to the wall or elsewhere, so that the creature may be undisturbed\r\nat its work. But in the nurseries abroad little bushes are set up on the\r\nwicker shelves, and the insects mount them and form their cocoons among\r\nthe twigs.\r\n\r\nSupposing the worm to be left to itself on the tray, without either of\r\nthese precautions, it at last selects some corner or hollow place which\r\nwill conveniently hold the cocoon it is about to spin, and begins by\r\nthrowing out a number of irregular threads, which are intended to\r\nsupport its nest. Upon these it forms, during the first day, a loose\r\nstructure of floss silk of an oval shape, within which, during the next\r\nthree days, it winds the firm, hard, yellow ball, remaining, of course,\r\nall the time within it. In this operation the insect does not greatly\r\nchange the position of the hinder part of its body, but continues\r\ndrawing its thread from various points and attaching it to others, so\r\nthat after a time the body becomes to a great extent enclosed by the\r\nthread. “The work is then continued from one thread to another, the\r\nsilkworm moving its head and spinning in a zigzag way, bending the fore\r\npart of the body back to spin in all directions within reach, and\r\nshifting the body only to cover with silk the part which was beneath it.\r\nAs the silkworm spins its web by thus bending the fore part of the body\r\nback, and moves the hinder part of the body in such a way only as to\r\nenable it to reach the farther back with the fore part, it follows that\r\nit encloses itself in a cocoon much shorter than its own body, for soon\r\nafter the beginning the whole is continued with the body in a bent\r\nposition. From the foregoing account it appears that with the most\r\nsimple instinctive principles all the ends necessary are gained. If the\r\nsilkworm shifted its position much at the beginning of the work, it\r\ncould never enclose itself in a cocoon; but by its mode of proceeding,\r\nas above explained, it encloses itself in a cocoon which only consumes\r\nas much silk as is necessary to hold the chrysalis.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE COCOON.\r\n\r\n  (_A portion of the floss silk has been removed._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe use of the cocoon, in the natural state of the insect, is to afford\r\na warm nest, where, secure from the inclemencies of the season, and the\r\nattacks of enemies, it may undergo its final changes. The cocoon is made\r\nwater-tight by an internal lining of gum, and the silken thread of which\r\nthe ball is made is also smeared with a similar gum, which hardens in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE CHRYSALIS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GIRL WINDING SILK.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWhile the worm is spinning its cocoon it takes no food, and as it is\r\ncontinually emitting silk, its body gradually diminishes to less than\r\nhalf its original length. When its labour is completed it rests awhile,\r\nand then once more throws off its skin; but it is no longer a\r\ncaterpillar; its form is changed into a chrysalis, or aurelia, with a\r\nsmooth brown skin, and pointed at one end. A few days after the insect\r\nhas finished spinning, the cocoons will be ready to be unwound. Our\r\namateur silkworm cultivator then takes the cocoons out of the paper\r\ncones and separates the outer floss silk. He then throws several cocoons\r\ninto a glass of water slightly warm, to make them more easy to unwind,\r\nand having found the ends, proceeds to wind the silk on a reel, or he\r\ngives the task to a sister’s gentler hands, while he prepares a little\r\nbox of bran, in readiness to put the poor exposed chrysalis the moment\r\nit is released from the cocoon. As the winding proceeds, the cocoons\r\nbecome thinner and thinner until the insects within are visible. The\r\nchrysalis, though covered with a horny skin, and apparently without much\r\nsensation, shows very plainly that it is sensible of the rough treatment\r\nit is receiving, as the cocoon is tossed about in the water by the\r\nmotion of the reel. It rapidly moves the rings of its tail, which is\r\ndoubtless a sign of uneasiness or pain. When nearly all the silk is\r\nwound off, there still remains a transparent film like silver paper,\r\nwhich is torn open to let out the chrysalis. The latter is immediately\r\nburied in bran, where it remains very quietly for a week or two, then\r\nchanges into a cream coloured moth, lays its eggs, and dies. This is the\r\ncommon domestic treatment when silkworms are kept for amusement, but in\r\na commercial establishment such as those of Italy, they are very\r\ndifferently treated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FEMALE SILKWORM MOTH AND EGGS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cocoons are collected in large quantities, separated and sorted\r\naccording to their quality, about one-sixtieth part being saved for the\r\nproduction of eggs, after which the life of the chrysalis is destroyed\r\nin all the rest. This is done in hot countries by exposure to the sun;\r\nbut in more temperate climes by artificial heat, such as that of an oven\r\nafter the bread has been withdrawn. Before the cocoons can be reeled\r\nthey must be separated from the floss, which is done by opening the\r\nfloss covering at one end and pushing out the cocoon. Care is taken in\r\nreeling to use cocoons of one quality, as different qualities require a\r\ndifferent treatment.\r\n\r\nThe natural gum of the cocoons is first softened in warm water, kept at\r\nthe proper temperature, either by a charcoal fire or by a steam pipe.\r\nAfter remaining in this for a few minutes, the reeler (generally a\r\nwoman) gently stirs up or brushes the cocoons with a short birch rod,\r\nand to this the loose threads of the cocoons adhere, and are thus drawn\r\nout of the water: they are then taken commonly four or five together,\r\ntwisted with the fingers into one thread, and passed through a metal\r\nloop, to get rid of dirt and impurities: the thread then passes on to\r\nthe reel, which is so constructed as to have a slight lateral motion, so\r\nthat the thread of one revolution does not overlay the other; for if it\r\ndid so, the threads would be glued together before the gum had had time\r\nto harden by exposure to the air. The threads of the four or five\r\ncocoons are thus united into one strong and smooth thread. Sometimes as\r\nmany as thirty cocoons are united into one thread, and it is difficult\r\nto wind more. As often as a thread of any single cocoon breaks or comes\r\nto an end, the attendant supplies its place by a new one, so that by\r\ncontinually keeping up the same number the united thread may be wound to\r\nany length: these joinings are not made by a knot, but the new end is\r\nsimply laid on the compound thread, to which it adheres by its gum; and\r\nas the threads are finer near their termination than at the\r\ncommencement, it is necessary for the reeler to add other cocoons before\r\nthe first set is quite exhausted; so that the compound thread may be of\r\nuniform thickness. The filaments of three fresh cocoons, added to two\r\nhalf-wound ones, make a thread about equal to that from four fresh\r\ncocoons. The cocoons are not entirely wound off, but the husk containing\r\nthe chrysalis is used together with the floss silk under the name of\r\nwaste. Improved methods of reeling have been introduced on the\r\ncontinent, but they are similar in principle to the above.\r\n\r\nEleven or twelve pounds of cocoons yield about one pound of reeled silk;\r\nand as from 240 to 250 cocoons weigh a pound, the number of cocoons\r\nrequired to produce a pound of silk may be estimated at 2,817½. The\r\nlength of filament yielded by a single cocoon is 300 yards, but some\r\nhave yielded as much as 625 yards.\r\n\r\nThe reeled silk is made up into hanks for sale or use. The form and\r\ncontents, as well as quality, of these hanks, differ greatly, as will be\r\nseen by the following wood-cuts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HANKS FROM ITALY.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BOOK OF SILK FROM CHINA.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SLIP FROM BENGAL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe may aptly conclude our account of this most industrious\r\nsilk-manufacturer in the words of the Rev. Samuel Pullein, M.A., who, so\r\nlong ago as 1758, wrote an Essay on the Culture of Silk, in which the\r\nfollowing passage occurs:—\r\n\r\n“There is scarce anything among the various wonders which the animal\r\ncreation affords more admirable than the variety of changes which the\r\nsilkworm undergoes; but the curious texture of that silken covering with\r\nwhich it surrounds itself when it becomes a moth, and arrives at the\r\nperfection of its animal life, vastly surpasses what is made by other\r\nanimals of this class. All the caterpillar kind do indeed undergo\r\nchanges like those of the silkworm, and the beauty of many of them in\r\ntheir butterfly state greatly exceeds it; but the covering which they\r\nput on before this change into a fly is poor and mean, when compared to\r\nthat golden tissue in which the silkworm wraps itself. They indeed come\r\nforth in variety of colours, their wings bedropped with gold and\r\nscarlet, yet are they but the beings of a summer’s day; both their life\r\nand beauty quickly vanish, and they leave no remembrance after them; but\r\nthe silkworm leaves behind it such beautiful, such beneficial monuments,\r\nas at once record both the wisdom of their Creator, and His bounty to\r\nman.”\r\n\r\nOn the importance of the silk itself, Kirby and Spence have the\r\nfollowing remarks:—\r\n\r\n“To estimate justly the importance of this article, it is not sufficient\r\nto view it as an appendage of luxury unrivalled for richness, lustre,\r\nand beauty, and without which courts would lose half their splendour; we\r\nmust consider it what it actually is, as the staple article of\r\ncultivation in many large provinces in the south of Europe, amongst the\r\ninhabitants of which the prospect of a deficient crop causes as great\r\nalarm as a scanty harvest of grain with us; and, after giving employment\r\nto tens of thousands in its first production and transportation, as\r\nfurnishing subsistence to hundreds of thousands more in its final\r\nmanufacture, and thus becoming one of the most important wheels that\r\ngive circulation to national wealth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GEOMETRIC SPIDER]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                    MANUFACTURE OF SILK BY SPIDERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur history of the silk manufacture among insects would be incomplete\r\nwithout a notice of the labours of spiders. Not only do these insects\r\nproduce filmy webs to entrap their prey, but they also spin, for the\r\nprotection of their eggs, a bag not much unlike the cocoon of the\r\nsilkworm. At the beginning of the last century a method was discovered\r\nof procuring silk from these spiders’ bags, and of making it into\r\nseveral useful articles. The experiments took place in France, and it\r\nwas there discovered that two species of spider in particular produced\r\nstrong and beautiful silk, capable of being usefully employed. The\r\nstructure of these insects was closely examined by the celebrated\r\nnaturalist Réaumur, and he found that the silk is spun from five\r\npapillæ, or small nipples, placed in the hinder part of the body; these\r\nserve the purpose of so many wire-drawing irons, to mould a gummy\r\nliquor, which dries as it is drawn out and exposed to the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SPINNING APPARATUS OF THE SPIDER.\r\n\r\n  (_Greatly magnified._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nOn pressing the body of a spider, the liquor flows into these nipples,\r\nby applying the finger against which, distinct threads may be drawn out\r\nthrough the numerous openings; and, what is very astonishing, every\r\nseparate thread is made up of innumerable smaller threads, so that\r\nRéaumur thought himself far within the limits of the truth when he\r\nstated that each of the five nipples supplied one thousand separate\r\nfibres, in which case the slender filament of the spider’s nest must be\r\nmade up of five thousand fibres. By applying the whole, or a part, of\r\nthis apparatus to her work, the spider can make the thread stout or fine\r\nat pleasure: thus the webs for entrapping flies are very slight and\r\nfragile; but the nest for securing the eggs is much stronger, to afford\r\nthem shelter from the cold. The threads are wound loosely round the eggs\r\nin a shape similar to that of the silkworm’s cocoon. The colour of the\r\nsilk is generally grey, becoming blackish on exposure to the air:\r\nsometimes it is pale yellow, and also of very fine quality; but this is\r\nthe production of comparatively rare species, which could not be\r\ndepended on for the purposes of manufacture. A spider’s nest preserved\r\nby the writer during the last winter was of a beautiful yellow, almost\r\napproaching that of the cocoon of the silkworm. As spring approached it\r\nincreased in bulk and became rather paler, until at last a dark\r\nappearance in the centre betokened the bursting of the eggs. At the\r\npresent time (April 10th) ninety-six small yellow-bodied spiders have\r\ncome forth, and are actively engaged in weaving their delicate webs\r\nacross the glass which contains them. A muslin cover admits air to the\r\ninterior, and these minute insects appear perfectly healthy although\r\ndeprived of their natural food. Some sugar was placed in the glass, but\r\nthey do not appear to have consumed any of it, although some of them\r\nhave been hatched for more than a fortnight. From the appearance of the\r\nnest, more of these spiders yet remain to be hatched.\r\n\r\nIn the French experiments, spiders’ nests in large quantities were\r\ncollected from the trunks of trees, corners of windows and vaults, and\r\neaves of houses at the time above mentioned, and from these a new kind\r\nof silk was obtained by M. Bon, who declared it to be in no respect\r\ninferior to that of the silkworm. It was afterwards proved that he was\r\ngreatly mistaken in this respect; yet the spiders’ silk readily took all\r\nkinds of dyes, and was actually wrought into stockings and gloves,\r\nspecimens of which were presented by M. Bon to the Royal Academy of\r\nParis, and also to the Royal Society of London. His method of preparing\r\nthe silk was as follows:—\r\n\r\nTwelve or thirteen ounces of the bags were beaten with the hand, or by a\r\nstick, until they were entirely free from dust. They were then washed in\r\nwarm water, which was frequently changed, until it was no longer\r\ndiscoloured by the bags. They were next steeped in a large quantity of\r\nwater, wherein soap, saltpetre, and gum-arabic had been dissolved. The\r\nwhole was then set to boil over a gentle fire for three hours. Lastly,\r\nthe bags were rinsed in clear warm water, and set out to dry. They were\r\nthen fit for the operation of carding, which was performed with very\r\nfine cards, and thus silk of a peculiar ash colour was obtained, which\r\nwas spun without difficulty.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SPIDER’S NEST ATTACHED TO A FLAT SURFACE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SPIDER’S NEST LAID OPEN.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe great obstacle which prevented the establishment of any considerable\r\nmanufacture from these spiders’ bags, was the difficulty of obtaining\r\nthem in sufficient abundance; but M. Bon, who was enthusiastic\r\nrespecting the value of his discovery, fancied that he could easily\r\novercome this obstacle, and at first his efforts appeared remarkably\r\nsuccessful. He formed a large spider establishment, which, for a time,\r\nwas very prosperous. Having ordered all the short-legged spiders (which\r\nare the most industrious spinners) to be collected for him by persons\r\nemployed for the purpose, he enclosed them in paper boxes, with\r\npin-holes pricked in them to admit the air to the prisoners. The insects\r\nwere regularly fed with flies, and prospered well on their diet. In due\r\ntime most of them laid their eggs, and spun their silken bags. M. Bon\r\naffirmed that each female produced from six to seven hundred eggs,\r\nwhereas the silkworm moth lays only about one hundred. He also stated,\r\nthat out of seven hundred or eight hundred young spiders which he kept,\r\nscarcely one died in a year; while of one hundred silkworms, not forty\r\nlived to form their cocoons.\r\n\r\nThese favourable statements led the Royal Academy of Paris to take the\r\nsubject into consideration, and Réaumur was appointed to inquire into\r\nthe merits of the new scheme. This careful inquirer found many serious\r\nobstacles in the way of such establishments. The fierceness of spiders,\r\nand their propensity to destroy each other, were noticed as unfitting\r\nthem to be bred and reared together. On distributing about five thousand\r\nspiders in cells, in companies of about fifty or a hundred, it was found\r\nthat the larger spiders quickly killed and ate the smaller, until there\r\nwere only one or two occupiers of each cell. The silk of the spider was\r\nalso found inferior in lustre and strength to that of the silkworm, and\r\nhad the disadvantage of being incapable of winding off the ball, but\r\nmust necessarily be carded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GARDEN SPIDER—(_Natural Size._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIndeed, it could require no very great consideration to decide, that\r\nspiders’ silk, when compared with that of the silkworm, was vastly\r\ninferior for manufacturing purposes, though employed in many useful and\r\nhighly ingenious ways by the insect itself. A few of these we must not\r\nomit to notice. Every one must have seen the common garden spider\r\n(_Epeira diadema_) suspended by its silken rope, or forming its\r\nbeautiful web; but every one is not aware that that silken rope is made\r\nup of a multiplicity of threads, and that when the spider attaches the\r\nrope to any object by pressing her spinneret against it, she spreads out\r\nthese threads over an area of some diameter, thus securing a much\r\ngreater degree of strength than could be gained by merely fixing her\r\nthread to one point. This contrivance may be seen best when the threads\r\nare attached to a black object. Under the microscope they appear thus:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SPIDER’S METHOD OF ATTACHING HER THREAD.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe uses of silk in the webs and nests of common spiders are too obvious\r\nto be dwelt on, but there is a most clever and surprising adaptation of\r\nthe same material by several foreign species of spider which must be\r\nbriefly stated. In the Ionian islands, and also in the West Indies,\r\nthere are found certain spiders, commonly known as trap-door spiders,\r\nwhich make a cylindrical nest in the earth, and cover the entrance with\r\na door of their own construction, framed of alternate layers of silk and\r\nearth, and fastened to the opening by a hinge of stout silk. These\r\nspiders also line their nests throughout with numerous layers of silken\r\nweb to the thickness of stout cartridge paper, and finish it with the\r\ngreatest care. This beautiful lining is yet further strengthened in\r\nparticular parts, where the nest is likely to be exposed to danger. But\r\nthe greatest amount of skill and care is bestowed upon the trap-door and\r\nits silken hinge. This door is about the eighth of an inch thick, rough\r\non the outside, not much unlike an oyster shell, which it also resembles\r\nin being thick and strong near the hinge, but thinner towards the\r\ncircumference. The breadth of this hinge is various, but sometimes it is\r\nvery considerable, as shown in the accompanying figure. It also\r\npossesses great elastic force, so that on being opened, it closes again\r\nof itself. This is principally accomplished by a fold or doubling of the\r\nweb, at each end of the hinge, which permits the door to be opened\r\nnearly to a right angle with the aperture, but no farther, unless\r\nviolence be used. The under side of the door is perfectly smooth and\r\nfirm, being shaped so as to fit accurately, and yet to offer no\r\nresistance when pushed open by the insect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TRAP-DOOR SPIDER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NEST OF TRAP-DOOR SPIDER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TRAP-DOOR OPENING BY A LEVER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, there are varieties in the shape and size of these\r\nnests. Some specimens found in the island of Zante had the silken layers\r\nof the lid extended into a sort of handle or lever just above the hinge,\r\non pressing which in ever so slight a degree the trap-door opened. From\r\nthis it would appear that the entrance to such a nest could be effected\r\nas easily by the enemies of the spider as by the spider itself: this,\r\nhowever, is not the case; for repeated observation has shown that the\r\nspider keeps guard at the entrance, and actually holds the door with her\r\nfore feet and palpi, while the hinder feet are extended down the side of\r\nthe nest, and the mandibles are thrust into the opposite side near the\r\ndoor. By this means the insect gets such power as to resist with\r\nconsiderable force the opening of the door. If it be asked how this is\r\nknown, we are able to refer to the experiments of careful observers, who\r\nextracted a number of nests from the ground, and opening them at the\r\nlower end, looked up, and saw the spider so occupied. A sectional view\r\nof the nest will show that the curved form of the cover, and the shape\r\nof the side walls, must favour this method of keeping the door shut. In\r\nsome cases, small hollows were formed round the interior edge of the\r\nlid, into which the spider thrust its feet when keeping guard. It is a\r\ncurious fact, that when several of these spiders enclosed in their nests\r\nwere kept as a matter of curiosity in a box of earth, and the doors\r\nfrequently opened to examine their proceedings, one or two of them, as\r\nif wearied at these repeated interruptions, effectually closed their\r\ndoors by weaving a piece of silken tapestry, which was spread over the\r\ninterior of the opening, and rounded like the inside of a thimble. This\r\nwas so strongly attached to the door and to the side walls, that no\r\nopening could be made without destroying the nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SECTION OF NEST.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt was long a matter of surprise to the observer to find, that in the\r\ncase of some nests, and not of others, there was a trap-door at the\r\nbottom as well as at the top of the nest: this was at last explained by\r\nthe following fact. A spider’s nest, which was accidentally broken off\r\nin being extracted from the ground, was purposely restored to the earth\r\nin a reversed position, with the trap-door downwards, and the broken and\r\nexposed part level with the surface. The spider immediately set to work\r\nto make a new door over the broken part, and finished it with as much\r\ncompleteness as the other. Doubtless, then, those nests which were\r\nprovided with two doors were such as had been upset and broken. This is\r\nthe more likely because in Zante, where such nests were found, the earth\r\nis annually dug up round the roots of the olive tree, a favourite\r\nnesting place of these trap-door spiders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NEST WITH TWO OPENINGS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe must not omit to mention, that in some parts of South America,\r\nespecially in Paraguay, there is a spider which forms a spherical cocoon\r\nfor its eggs, an inch in diameter, of a yellow silk, which the\r\ninhabitants spin on account of the permanency of the colour. It must\r\nalso be observed that the silk of spiders is useful to the astronomer,\r\nwho employs the strongest thread (the one, namely, which supports the\r\nweb) for the divisions of the micrometer. By its ductility, this thread\r\nacquires about a fifth of its ordinary length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WHITE WAX INSECT OF CHINA.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n MANUFACTURE OF WAX BY THE HIVE BEE, THE HUMBLE BEE, AND THE WHITE WAX\r\n                            INSECT OF CHINA.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GRUB IN CELL.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Chrysalis]]\r\n\r\nThe most notable insect manufacturer, after the silkworm, is the common\r\nhive bee, which is able to produce three distinct substances, honey,\r\nwax, and silk; the first two only being useful to mankind. Persons who\r\nhave never seen bees in any other than their perfect state, and are\r\nunacquainted with the internal economy of the hive, will learn with\r\nsurprise that the first appearance of this insect is that of a small\r\nstraight worm, which rapidly increases in size until it touches the\r\nsides of the cell which forms its dwelling-place. It then coils itself\r\nup, until the extremities meet and form a complete ring. When it ceases\r\neating, the nurse-bees seal up the cell, leaving the caterpillar to spin\r\nits cocoon in safety. The silken film in which the insect now begins to\r\nwrap itself, proceeds from a spinner, situated in the middle part of the\r\nunder lip, and is composed of two threads, gummed together as they issue\r\nfrom the two orifices of the spinner. The caterpillar is employed during\r\nthirty-six hours in making its cocoon; three days after which it becomes\r\na chrysalis. Over this chrysalis, or rather over the cell in which it is\r\ncontained, the nurse-bees brood until the warmth of their bodies\r\npenetrates, and assists in producing the last change of the insect\r\nwithin. The cocoon, by degrees, becomes attached to the interior of the\r\ncell like a lining, and the bee, having its parts gradually unfolded,\r\nbegins at length to cut its way through the cover of the cell. It is now\r\na perfect bee, and capable at once of taking its part in the labours of\r\nthe hive. These labours chiefly relate to food, shelter, and care of the\r\nyoung. In the article of food, the bee is a most industrious collector\r\nof the sweet juices of flowers, which are converted into the luscious\r\nhoney with which she stores her hive. She also collects pollen, as an\r\ningredient in the food of the young, and a gummy substance called\r\npropolis, which oozes from the poplar, birch, and willow, and which she\r\nuses as a sort of varnish and cement to the projecting parts of the\r\nhive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BEES GATHERING HONEY.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HEAD OF BEE.\r\n\r\n  (_Magnified._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of collecting, carrying home, and manufacturing these\r\nseveral products, the working bee is provided with a complete and\r\nbeautiful apparatus, consisting of a _proboscis_ (almost as wonderful in\r\nits way as that of the elephant), by which she ascertains the nature of\r\nfood, and imbibes such as is adapted to her wants; a _honey bag_, or\r\nsecond stomach, which is a small transparent globe about the size of a\r\npea, where she deposits her nectar; a _pair of baskets_, one in each\r\nhind leg, in which she stores the pollen of flowers, and the propolis or\r\ngum of trees; and lastly, in the case of the wax-makers, _four pairs of\r\nwax pockets_, or membranous bags, contained in the abdomen, where by\r\nsome unknown process wax is secreted from the food taken into the\r\nstomach. What an astonishing provision for the requirements of a single\r\ninsect!\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HIND LEG OF WORKER.\r\n\r\n  _a_, the haunch; _b_, the thigh; _c_, the tibia, or pallet, containing\r\n    the basket or cavity; _d_, _e_, the foot.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE MANUFACTURE OF WAX.\r\n\r\nThe honey-comb of a bee is a beautiful and highly curious object, and is\r\ncomposed of wax, a substance which man, with all his skill, is unable to\r\nfabricate. Whether the hive be natural or artificial, the plan of its\r\nconstruction is much the same. A number of honey-combs, chiefly composed\r\nof _six-sided_ cells, regularly applied to each other’s sides, and\r\narranged in two layers, are fixed to the upper part and sides of the\r\ninterior of the hive. These combs are arranged at a small distance from\r\neach other, and the cells have their openings into the spaces between\r\nthem, which are wide enough to allow two bees to pass each other easily.\r\nBesides these vacancies the combs are here and there pierced with holes,\r\nwhich serve as a means of communication from one comb to another,\r\nwithout losing time by going round.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  INTERIOR OF THE HIVE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cells being formed of wax, a substance secreted by the bees in no\r\ngreat abundance, it is important that as little as possible should be\r\nconsumed. Bees, therefore, in the formation of their cells have to solve\r\na problem in geometry, namely, “a quantity of wax being given, to form\r\nof it similar and equal cells of a determinate capacity, but of the\r\nlargest size in proportion to the quantity of matter employed, and\r\ndisposed in such a manner as to occupy in the hive the least possible\r\nspace.” Every part of this problem is practically solved by bees. If\r\ntheir cells had been cylindrical, which form seems best adapted to the\r\nshape of a bee, they could not have been applied to each other without\r\nleaving a number of useless vacant spaces. If the cells had been square\r\nor triangular, this last objection would be removed; but a greater\r\nquantity of wax would have been required, and the shape would have been\r\ninconvenient to a round-bodied animal. Hexagonal cells are admirably\r\nfitted to the form of the insect, at the same time that their sides\r\napply to each other without the smallest vacant intervals. Another\r\nimportant saving in materials is gained by making a common base serve\r\nfor two layers of cells. Much more wax as well as room would have been\r\nrequired, had the combs consisted of one layer only. But this is not\r\nall. The base of each cell is not an exact plane, but is usually\r\ncomposed of three lozenge-shaped pieces, placed so as to form a\r\npyramidal concavity. From this form it follows that the base of a cell\r\non one side of the comb is composed of portions of the bases of _three_\r\ncells on the other. By this arrangement a greater degree of strength is\r\nobtained, and also a more roomy cell, with less expenditure of wax. This\r\nhas been clearly proved, as also that the angles of the base of the cell\r\nare exactly those which require the smallest quantity of wax. It is\r\nobvious that these angles might vary infinitely; but by a very accurate\r\nmeasurement Maraldi found that the great angles were in general 109°\r\n28′, the smaller ones 70° 32′. Réaumur, suspecting that the object of\r\nchoosing these angles was to spare wax, proposed to M. König, a skilful\r\ngeometrician, to determine by calculation what ought to be the angle of\r\na hexagonal cell with a pyramidal bottom, formed of three similar and\r\nequal rhomboid plates, so that the least possible matter might enter\r\ninto its construction. After an elaborate calculation, the geometrician\r\nfound that the great angles of the rhombs should be 109° 26′, and of the\r\nsmall angles, 70° 34′, a surprising agreement between the solution of\r\nthe problem, and the actual measurement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FRONT AND REVERSE VIEW OF CELLS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  METHOD OF JOINING CELLS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe bees have also another contrivance for saving wax. They form the\r\nbottoms and sides of the cells of wax not thicker than writing paper;\r\nbut as walls of this thinness at the entrance would be perpetually\r\ninjured by the going in and out of the workers, they make the margin at\r\nthe opening of each cell three or four times thicker than the walls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FESTOON OF WAX-MAKERS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt has already been said that wax is a secretion naturally formed in\r\ncertain membranous bags in the body of the bee. As the secretion goes\r\non, the wax oozes through the membrane, and forms in thin plates on the\r\noutside. The position adopted by the insects during this process is\r\nstrange and almost ridiculous. Their proceedings are as follows:—The\r\nwax-makers, having taken a quantity of honey or sugar into the stomach,\r\nsuspend themselves to each other, the claws of the fore legs of one\r\nbeing attached to those of the hind pair of another, until they form\r\nthemselves into a cluster, consisting of a series of festoons or\r\ngarlands, which cross each other in all directions, until they form a\r\ndense curtain, and in which most of the bees turn their back upon the\r\nobserver. In this position the wax-makers remain immovable for about\r\ntwenty-four hours, during which period the secretion of wax takes place.\r\nAt last one of them is seen to detach itself from the rest, and to make\r\nits way to the top of the hive, where it turns itself round, and clears\r\na space of about an inch in diameter. It then seizes one of the plates\r\nof wax with a pincer, formed at the joints of the leg, and drawing it\r\nforwards, one of the fore legs takes it with its claw and carries it to\r\nthe mouth. The insect then proceeds by means of its mandibles and its\r\nproboscis to reduce the plate to a riband of wax, which it softens with\r\na frothy liquor. During this operation the proboscis is sometimes\r\nflattened like a spatula, then like a trowel, at other times it is like\r\na pencil, terminating in a point. The liquor mixed with the wax gives it\r\na whiteness and ductility which it had not before, the object being to\r\nmake it fit for working into any shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE PROBOSCIS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LAYING FOUNDATION OF CELL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe parcels of wax thus prepared are applied against the vault of the\r\nhive, the little builder arranging them in the direction she wishes them\r\nto take: when she has thus employed the whole plate that she had\r\nseparated from her body, she takes a second, and proceeds in the same\r\nmanner. At length she leaves her work, and is lost in the crowd of her\r\ncompanions. Another succeeds, and resumes the employment; then a third:\r\nall follow the same plan of placing their wax; and if one by chance\r\ngives it a contrary direction, another, coming after, sets it right. The\r\nresult of all these operations is a little wall of wax, with uneven\r\nsurfaces, five or six lines[1] long, two lines high, and half a line\r\nthick, which descends perpendicularly from the vault of the hive. In\r\nthis first work there is no angle, nor any trace of the figure of the\r\ncells. It is a simple partition, in a right line, without any bend.\r\n\r\nFootnote 1:\r\n\r\n  A line is the twelfth part of an inch.\r\n\r\nThe wax-makers having thus laid the foundation of a comb, the nurse-bees\r\ncome to model and complete the work. The former are the labourers, who\r\nconvey the materials; the latter, the artists, who work them up into the\r\nrequired form. One of the nurse-bees places herself horizontally on the\r\nvault of the hive, her head corresponding to the centre of the wall\r\nwhich the wax-makers have left, and which is to form the partition of\r\nthe comb into two opposite assemblages of cells; and rapidly moving her\r\nhead, she moulds with her jaws a cavity which is to form the base of one\r\nof the cells. When she has worked some minutes she departs, and another\r\ntakes her place, deepening the hollow, and heightening its sides by\r\nheaping up the wax to the right and left, by means of the teeth and fore\r\nfeet. More than twenty bees successively employ themselves in this work.\r\nWhen arrived at a certain point, other bees begin on the yet untouched\r\nand opposite side of the mass, and commencing the bottom of _two_ cells,\r\nare in turn relieved by others. While still engaged in this labour the\r\nwax-makers return, and add to the mass, increasing its extent every way,\r\nthe nurse-bees again continuing their operations. After having worked\r\nthe bottoms of the cells of the first row into their proper forms, they\r\npolish them, and give them finish, while others begin the outline of a\r\nnew series.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COMMENCEMENT OF CELLS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe cells themselves, consisting of six-sided tubes, are next\r\nconstructed. The bees commence by making the edges of the cavities of\r\nequal height, so that all the margins of the cells offer an uniformly\r\nlevel surface. The sides are heightened in an order similar to that\r\nwhich the insects follow in finishing the bottoms of the cells; and the\r\nlength of these tubes is so perfectly proportioned, that there is no\r\nobservable inequality between them. It is to be remarked, that though\r\nthe general form of the cell is hexagonal, or six-sided, that of those\r\nfirst begun is an irregular pentagon, the side next the top of the hive,\r\nand by which the comb is attached, being much broader than the rest;\r\nwhence the comb is more strongly united to the hive than if these cells\r\nwere of the ordinary shape.\r\n\r\nIn giving the proper forms to the bottoms of the cells, the bees make\r\nmuch use of their antennæ, which extraordinary organs they seem to\r\nemploy as directors, by which their other instruments are instructed to\r\nexecute a very complex work. They do not remove a single particle of wax\r\nuntil the antennæ have explored the surface that is to be sculptured. By\r\nthe use of these organs, which are flexible, and readily applied to all\r\nparts, however delicate, they can perform the functions of compasses in\r\nmeasuring very minute objects, and can work in the dark, and raise their\r\nwonderful combs.\r\n\r\nAll these proceedings are conducted with the utmost regularity. The\r\noriginal mass of wax is increased in a uniform quantity by the\r\nwax-makers, who merely produce and carry the materials, but have not the\r\nart of sculpturing the cells. Two masses of wax for combs are never\r\nbegun at the same time; but no sooner are some rows of cells constructed\r\nin the first mass, when two other masses, one on each side of it, are\r\nestablished at equal distances from it, and parallel to it, and then\r\nagain two more exterior to these. In a new hive the bees work with such\r\nrapidity, that in twenty-four hours they will sometimes construct a comb\r\ntwenty inches long by seven or eight inches wide, and the hive will be\r\nhalf filled in five or six days; so that in the first fifteen days as\r\nmuch wax is made as in the whole year besides.\r\n\r\nThe commercial value of wax is considerable. A simple way of preparing\r\nit for use is as follows. When the hive has been cleared of honey, the\r\nwax is put into a woollen bag firmly tied at the mouth; the bag is\r\nplunged into a pan of boiling water; the pure material oozes through the\r\ncloth, and swims upon the surface; it is carefully skimmed off, as long\r\nas any continues to rise, and poured into a shallow earthen bowl, which\r\nis previously wetted to prevent the wax from adhering to its sides. It\r\nmust be allowed to cool very gradually, otherwise the cake which it\r\nforms will crack.\r\n\r\nAn inferior kind of wax is made by those large bees called humble bees,\r\nwhose gay colours and booming flight make them so well known in our\r\ngardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FEMALE HUMBLE BEE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nEarly in spring, as soon as the catkins of the willows are in flower, a\r\nlarge solitary female may be seen about them collecting honey and\r\npollen. She is the only survivor of the former year’s colony, and is the\r\nfoundress of a new one. Her first care on awaking from her winter’s\r\nsleep is to excavate a hollow in the earth for her nest, which is often\r\nabove a foot under the surface, and is entered by a passage or gallery.\r\nWhen complete, she lines it with soft leaves, and then proceeds to make\r\nher waxen cells. This she does so quickly,[2] that she can build a cell,\r\nfill it with honey and pollen, deposit one or two eggs in it, and cover\r\nthem in, in little more than half an hour. A number of these cells are\r\nthus constructed; the eggs are hatched, and the little worms, increasing\r\nrapidly in size, at last spin silken cocoons, and undergo the usual\r\nchanges. The workers are the most numerous portion of the population,\r\nand have abundant employment throughout the summer. One of their first\r\ncares is to line the roof of their nest with wax, to keep it warm and\r\nprevent water from filtering through. The wax of these insects is not so\r\ndelicate, white, firm, or fusible as that of the hive bee, nor is it\r\napplied to such exquisite architecture; it is brown and soft, but well\r\nadapted to the rude works of their nest. It is formed in wax-pockets\r\nsimilar to those of the hive bee, and is moulded in plates to the shape\r\nof the insect’s body. Unlike the queen of the hive, the foundress of\r\nthis colony secretes wax, and does so even more abundantly than one of\r\nher workers.\r\n\r\nFootnote 2:\r\n\r\n  The rapid formation of wax in the case of humble bees is very\r\n  remarkable. Huber confined a number of them, and fed them during many\r\n  days with pollen only; they produced no wax, constructed no cells, and\r\n  laid no eggs; but on giving them honey, wax was produced in a few\r\n  minutes, and the work of the colony proceeded.\r\n\r\nThe interior of a humble bee’s nest has none of the beauty and\r\nregularity of the hive. Instead of a number of vertical combs of wax\r\nthere is a confused and clumsy assemblage of egg-shaped bodies of\r\ndirty-coloured wax, placed one above the other, forming a series of\r\nhorizontal combs, resting upon each other and connected by small pillars\r\nof wax. These egg-shaped bodies are of different sizes; those in the\r\nmiddle being the largest, closely joined to each other, and each group\r\nconnected with those next it by slight joinings of wax. These oval\r\nbodies are the silken cocoons spun by the young larvæ; some are closed\r\nat the top, and include inmates; others, chiefly in the lower combs, are\r\nopen, the young bees having escaped from them. On the surface of the\r\nupper comb are several masses of wax of a roundish and irregular form,\r\nabout an inch and a quarter in diameter and half an inch deep; these are\r\nbrood cells, containing each six or seven large larvæ, lying close\r\ntogether upon a quantity of pollen and honey placed there for the\r\npurpose of nourishing them as soon as they are hatched. When the food is\r\nconsumed, the workers make an opening in the top of the cell and\r\nintroduce a new supply, taking care to seal up the cells again. The\r\ncells are sometimes split open as the grub increases in size, upon which\r\nthe workers fill up the cracks with wax, as fast as they occur. It is a\r\ncurious fact, that these insects make use of the empty cocoons as\r\nhoney-pots, first lining them with wax, and strengthening them round the\r\nedges with a waxen ring. Some nests contain as many as fifty or sixty of\r\nthese honey-pots, containing stores for daily use, and which are never\r\nsealed over like the cells of the hive bee, because all the colony\r\nexcept one female dies at the approach of winter, and this solitary\r\nfemale lies in a torpid state during that season.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CELLS OF THE HUMBLE BEE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut bees are not the only wax-makers in the world. There is, in China,\r\nan insect called the white wax insect, which, in its caterpillar state,\r\ndeposits a sort of wax on the branches of trees. Sir George Staunton\r\ntells us that accident led him to observe some swarms of uncommon\r\ninsects busily employed upon the branches of a shrub, not at that time\r\nin fruit or flower, but whose leaves and general growth somewhat\r\nresembled our privet. These insects, not much bigger than common flies,\r\nwere of curious structure, having an appendage to their bodies, in shape\r\nlike the tail feathers of our common fowl. This, as well as the whole\r\nbody, was either perfectly white, or covered with a white powder, some\r\nof which was left in the track of the insect on the stems and leaves of\r\nthe shrub. This was the early stage of the insect’s life, and that in\r\nwhich wax is formed. The wax is described as being a greasy white\r\nsubstance when first deposited on the leaves and branches, where it soon\r\nhardens into a more compact form. The insect in its perfect state is of\r\na blackish chestnut colour, and is furnished with wings. It deposits its\r\neggs in little pellets about the size of a grain of millet, but these\r\nenlarge in the spring, and being attached to the branches, give to the\r\nshrub exactly the appearance of being loaded with fruit. About Midsummer\r\nthese pellets open and disclose the insects, which soon begin to crawl\r\nabout the branches and deposit wax.\r\n\r\nIt is in the autumnal months that the Chinese scrape the wax from the\r\nbranches of trees, collecting it in a vessel, and then melting and\r\nstraining it. They next coagulate it by pouring it into a vessel of cold\r\nwater, and this gives it a pasty form, in which it is easily made into\r\ncakes of the required size. This wax is exceedingly white and glossy,\r\nand when mixed with oil and made into candles, it is even superior for\r\nthat purpose to the wax made by bees. Sir G. Staunton says that the\r\nproduct of these insects not only coagulates into wax, but will cause\r\noleaginous substances to coagulate likewise, so that if one part of this\r\nwax be dissolved in three parts of heated olive oil, the whole, when\r\ncold, will coagulate into a mass, possessing a degree of firmness nearly\r\nequal to that of bees-wax. A Chinese writer states that it was not until\r\nthe dynasty of Yuen that the wax made by these insects became known in\r\nChina; but that as soon as its properties were ascertained, persons of\r\nall ranks began to use it, both in medicine and domestic economy. The\r\nmedicinal qualities of the wax were much extolled by Chinese physicians,\r\nand a curious use of it is stated in Grosier’s China, namely, that the\r\nChinese orators, when about to speak in public and needing assurance,\r\npreviously eat an ounce of this wax to prevent swoonings. But apart from\r\nvirtues which existed chiefly in the fancy of the Chinese, the uses of\r\nthis substance in making candles, and for the ordinary purposes to which\r\nbees-wax is applied, are highly important. The wax, it is said, is\r\ncarried to court and reserved for the emperor, the princes, and chief\r\nmandarins. The producing insects are found in most of the south-eastern\r\nprovinces of China, as well as in Cochin China.\r\n\r\nNearly the whole of the wax employed in Europe, and the greater part of\r\nthat consumed in America, is the produce of the common hive bee, but in\r\nthe latter country the produce of wild bees is also extensively used.\r\nWax forms an important branch of trade and commerce in all those\r\ncountries where the Roman Catholic religion prevails, being extensively\r\nused in the festivals and rites of that church. According to Humboldt,\r\nwax to the value of eighty-three thousand pounds was formerly annually\r\nexported from Cuba to New Spain, where the quantity consumed in the\r\nfestivals of the church is immense, even in the smallest villages. The\r\ntotal exports from Cuba in the year 1803 were worth upwards of\r\n130,000_l._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Hive]]\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                 MANUFACTURE OF HONEY BY THE HIVE BEE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany and various are the trees, shrubs, and plants, yielding blossoms\r\nrich in honey, which have been recommended to be cultivated in the\r\nneighbourhood of bee-hives; and no one can have watched the proceedings\r\nof the industrious inhabitants without observing that the early blossoms\r\nof the sallow and of the horse-chestnut seem peculiarly acceptable, and\r\nlater in the season those of the lime; while mignonette, thyme,\r\nrosemary, lavender, and various other flowers, are assiduously visited\r\nby these diligent collectors. But the best stores of our gardens yield a\r\nscanty supply compared with the treasures of the fields, such as bean\r\nblossoms, and clover blossoms. The latter crop (especially the white\r\nDutch clover called honeysuckle) is so rich in sweet juices, that when\r\nthere is plenty of it, a good supply of honey is also pretty certain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE PASSION-FLOWER.\r\n\r\n  (_Passiflora Cærulea._)\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn autumn, bees attack fruit after birds or snails have removed the\r\nouter skin. They also consume _honey-dew_, the sweet fluid which is\r\ndropped by the aphis. At this season also the Passion-flower affords a\r\nseasonable supply of liquid honey. The fondness of the bee for the honey\r\nof this flower is thus noticed by Mr. Wailes in the _Entomological\r\nMagazine_. He says, “Against the south front of our house, several\r\nplants of the _Passiflora Cærulea_ are trained, which cover it to the\r\nheight of some twenty feet, or thereabouts; and, from July to November,\r\nthe constant succession of its beautiful flowers attract great numbers\r\nof the hive bee, especially during autumn, when flowers productive of\r\nmuch honey are scarce. Every one knows the passion-flower, and need\r\nhardly be told that one series of the rays of the nectary closely\r\nsurrounds the stipes or shaft, whilst other two are beautifully spread\r\nover the horizontal leaves of the corolla; but perhaps few are aware\r\nthat the tube of the calyx contains several drops of pure and delicious\r\nhoney. On the arrival of each bee, I can at once tell whether it has\r\nbeen a prior visitor or not, by its mode of procedure. Should it be a\r\nfirst visit, the little busy creature is for a time quite at a loss; it,\r\nof course, scents the honey, but cannot discover the entrance to the\r\nstorehouse. Convinced that there is plenty of the object of its search\r\nin the flower, the bee hurries over the surface in all directions, now\r\nrunning its head fast between the corolla and the outer double series of\r\nthe rays of the nectary, now entangling itself amongst the beautiful\r\nrays themselves, and anon mounting the stipes, and ransacking the parts\r\nof fructification. At length, after a bustling scene, which frequently\r\nlasts for two or three minutes, and which the bee’s certainty that honey\r\nis concealed somewhere in the neighbourhood prevents its quitting in\r\ndespair, sometimes apparently by mere chance, at others by running the\r\nscent home, its indefatigable labours are rewarded. Now, with its tongue\r\ninserted amongst the rays surrounding the shaft, and past the projecting\r\nrim which almost closes the entrance to the tube of the calyx, it drinks\r\nits fill, and flies off for the hive, to deposit its treasure, and\r\nprofit by experience on a future trip. Far different is the manner of\r\nthe bee that has been at the work before; it wastes not a moment of the\r\ntime which the approach of winter renders doubly valuable, but at once\r\nalights on the flower, runs to its centre, and plunging its tongue into\r\nthe liquid sweet, hurries back loaded to the hive.”\r\n\r\nAncient writers speak of the practice of removing bees to fresh pastures\r\nevery autumn, as common in their times; and this practice is still\r\ncontinued in many parts of the world with great advantage to\r\nbee-keepers. Towards the end of August, when wild flowers have almost\r\ndisappeared, and gardens are fading, and clover is no longer in blossom,\r\nit is very desirable to find some fresh pasturage for the bees. The\r\nautumnal transportation of bees is approved of in the east, and also in\r\nmany parts of the European continent; but in England it is seldom\r\nadopted. Nevertheless, it is almost universal in Scotland. “About five\r\nmiles from Edinburgh,” says Dr. Bevan, “at the foot of the Pentland\r\nhills stands Logan House, supposed the former residence of Sir W.\r\nWorthy, celebrated by Allan Ramsay, in his ‘Gentle Shepherd.’ The house\r\nis now occupied by a shepherd, who, during July and August, receives\r\nabout a hundred bee-hives from his neighbours beyond the hills, that\r\ntheir bees may gather the honey from the luxuriant blossoms of the\r\nmountain heather.” This is only one instance out of numbers, for in this\r\nway our careful northern neighbours manage to double their harvest of\r\nhoney, taking not unfrequently almost the whole store from their hives\r\nbefore transporting them to the moors, and reaping an ample quantity\r\nagain on their return in three weeks’ time.\r\n\r\nA writer on this subject regrets that our own moorlands are not made\r\navailable to this end. “The very air,” he says, “is often redolent with\r\nthe rich perfume, while here and there a solitary bee is seen or heard,\r\nlabouring with wearied wing among the inexhaustible stores of nature,\r\nand scarcely able to regain its lonely shieling in the distant vale.\r\nWhen we consider the poverty of our mountaineers, and their frequent\r\nwant of occupation, it is the more to be lamented that so easy a source\r\nof emolument should lie open to them in vain.” From the Journal of\r\nAgriculture we learn that Poland is, perhaps, the greatest\r\nhoney-producing country in Europe. In the provinces of Podolia, Ukraine\r\nand Volhynia in particular, the cultivation of the honey-bee has long\r\nformed an object of national importance; and these bee-gardens are not\r\nonly very numerous and extensive, but they are also common in other\r\nparts of the kingdom. There are cottages in Poland, with very small\r\nportions of land attached to them, on which are to be seen as many as\r\nfifty hives; while there are farmers and landed proprietors who are in\r\npossession of from one hundred to ten thousand hives. There are some\r\nfarmers who collect annually more than 200 barrels of fine honey, each\r\nbarrel weighing from 400 to 500 lbs., exclusive of the wax. A tenant is\r\noften in this way enabled to pay his rent and taxes, to defray other\r\ndomestic expenses, and often to accumulate handsome dowries for his\r\ndaughters.\r\n\r\nThe middle of September is about the time for the honey-harvest, or\r\nin-gathering of the stores of the hive. Those hives which are designed\r\nfor winter stock must be set apart and weighed. A common straw hive when\r\nempty weighs from five to six pounds, an ordinary swarm about four\r\npounds, the wax of a full hive two or three pounds, the farina in the\r\ncells one pound, making in all fifteen pounds. A stock, therefore, to be\r\nsecure, must weigh double that amount, that is, it should not contain\r\nless than fifteen pounds of honey. The bees, it is true, may exist\r\nthrough the winter on a smaller quantity than this, but this would\r\ndepend very much on the nature of the season; whereas with fifteen\r\npounds they are considered safe, so far as food is concerned, whatever\r\nthe temperature may be. These stock-hives being selected, the cultivator\r\nnow proceeds to take the honey from the rest of the hives.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways of taking honey, known as “partial deprivation,”\r\n“suffocation,” and “driving.” For the first of these, hives of two\r\nstories are mostly employed. Immediately after the swarming season\r\nanother story, or box, is added, either above or below, and one of those\r\nfilled with honey is taken away. If this be done early enough in the\r\nseason, there will be time for the bees to fill the empty story before\r\nwinter; but if it be delayed, as is sometimes the case, until the\r\nbeginning or middle of September, then the bees, having no opportunity\r\nof replacing what has been taken away, will be starved before the winter\r\nis over. This method of taking honey is by no means general, apparently\r\nbecause, from an error as to the _time_ of performing the operation, it\r\nhas frequently failed.\r\n\r\nThe second, or suffocating process, is effected by taking strips of\r\nlinen rag, dipping them in melted brimstone, and placing them on a few\r\nsticks in a hollow place in the ground: then light is set to the rags,\r\nand the hive quickly set over them. Every hole being stopped up to\r\nprevent the escape of the sulphur fumes, the bees are soon suffocated,\r\nand the combs discoloured. This cruel and objectionable practice is,\r\nperhaps, the most common of any, being the least troublesome, though not\r\nthe most economical mode of getting at the honey.\r\n\r\nThe third, or driving system, saves the lives of the bees, by turning\r\nthem out into a well-stored stock-hive, and need not give any great\r\namount of additional trouble. It is thus described in the Naturalists’\r\nLibrary:—“In the evening, when all are quiet, turn up the hive which is\r\nto be operated upon, fixing it in a chair from which the stuffed bottom\r\nhas been removed; place an empty hive above it, wrap a cloth round the\r\npoint of junction, to prevent the bees from coming out and annoying the\r\noperator; then, with a short stick or stone in each hand, beat round the\r\nsides, but gently, for fear of loosening the combs. In five minutes the\r\npanic-struck insects will hastily mount into the empty hive, with a loud\r\nhumming noise, expressive of their trepidation. The hives are then\r\nseparated; that containing the bees is placed on its usual pedestal, and\r\nthe other, containing the honey, is carried off. The union is next to be\r\neffected. Turn up the stock-hive which is to receive the addition to its\r\npopulation,—with a bunch of feathers, or a small watering-pan, such as\r\nis used for watering flower-beds, drench them with a solution of ale and\r\nsugar, or water and sugar made a little warm. Do the same to the\r\nexpelled bees; and then placing these last over the stock, mouth to\r\nmouth, a smart rap on the top of the hive will drive them down among the\r\nbees and combs of the undermost hive. Place this last on its pedestal,\r\nand the operation is completed. The strong flavour of the solution will\r\nprevent them from distinguishing between friend and stranger; and their\r\nfirst movement after recovering from their panic will be to lick the\r\nliquid from one another’s bodies. It will be an advantage, though a\r\nlittle additional trouble, to search for and destroy the queen of the\r\nexpelled bees before the union takes place.”\r\n\r\nWhen the bees have been removed from the hives by one of the above\r\nprocesses, the operation of extracting the honey must commence\r\nimmediately, while the hive is yet warm. The warmth may also be kept up\r\nby allowing it to flow in a room where there is a fire. The comb should\r\nbe kept from the air as much as possible, for which purpose some\r\ncultivators make use of a tin-covered vessel, pierced with holes at the\r\nbottom, and made to fit into another similar vessel fit to receive the\r\nhoney. Pieces of comb, sliced horizontally, are put into this covered\r\nvessel, and the honey filters through the bottom, being first passed\r\nthrough a filter of wire-cloth or muslin placed at a little distance\r\nabove the other. This upper filter prevents the vessel from becoming\r\nclogged with particles of wax, and increases the purity of the honey. A\r\nspigot in the lower vessel allows the honey to pass out into store jars.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the processes by which the honey and wax of bees are\r\nmade available to our use. Honey is of less importance to mankind since\r\nthe discovery of sugar; but it will always rank among the wholesome and\r\nagreeable luxuries of life; while in countries where sugar is not so\r\neasily obtained as it is among ourselves, it holds a much more important\r\nposition. In the Ukraine, some of the peasants have four or five hundred\r\nbee-hives, and make more profit of their bees than of their corn. In\r\nSpain, also, the number of bee-hives is said to be immense, a single\r\nparish priest having been known to possess five thousand.\r\n\r\nRock-honey, found in some parts of America, is thin and clear as water,\r\nand is the produce of wild bees, which suspend thirty or forty waxen\r\ncells, resembling a bunch of grapes, to a rock.\r\n\r\nGreen honey, found in the Isle of Bourbon, and exported to India, where\r\nit fetches a high price, is the produce of a bee much esteemed in that\r\nisland. It produces sweet and fragrant honey, of the consistency of oil,\r\nand of a green colour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ANOTHER INTERIOR OF A BEE-HIVE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MALE COCHINEAL INSECT.—(_Magnified._)\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FEMALE.—_Upper surface._\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  FEMALE.—_Under surface._\r\n]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n   MANUFACTURE OF COCHINEAL BY THE COCCUS CACTI, OR COCHINEAL INSECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cochineal insect is extremely valuable in commerce, as yielding a\r\nbrilliant red dye, and we may with propriety class it among insect\r\nmanufactures, because, although its destruction is necessary to obtain\r\nthe colouring matter, (the actual body of the insect forming the dye,)\r\nyet this beautiful colour is elaborated from the food on which it feeds,\r\nas honey and wax are elaborated by the bee, or silk by the silkworm. We\r\ndo not find, it is true, any especial care or effort on the part of the\r\ninsect in the production of the cochineal, and in this respect it\r\ndiffers from the examples already given; but the rich colour which\r\npervades the body of the insect appears to result simply from the juices\r\nof the particular species of cactus on which it feeds. Yet being to us\r\nthe only means of obtaining the brilliant dye in question, the cochineal\r\ninsects must be reckoned highly useful, though involuntary,\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\nCochineal insects are very small, delicate creatures, remarkable for the\r\ngreat difference in the form of the male and female. The former has a\r\nslender body, long antennæ, and two large wings; the latter an oval\r\nbody, without wings, and short antennæ. The mouth in both insects\r\nconsists of a small conical bill and sucker, adapted for feeding on the\r\njuices of vegetables. At first, all the young brood, whether male or\r\nfemale, resemble tiny red tortoises, and are busily engaged in feeding\r\non the stems and leaves of plants, which they pierce with their sharp\r\nbeaks so as to do much injury. During this active period of their lives\r\nthe insects continue to increase in size, but the period soon arrives\r\nwhen they undergo a transformation. All the insects fix themselves\r\nfirmly to plants or stems, and the male soon appears in his new dress as\r\na fly, while the female merely changes her skin, and remains fixed to\r\nthe bark, which she gradually becomes so nearly like, that it is\r\ndifficult to distinguish her. She now lays her eggs, which are very\r\nnumerous, and which she accumulates beneath her body; but, at the same\r\ntime, she gradually dwindles in size until her body becomes a mere\r\npellicle or thin membrane enclosing the brood. The mother then dies, but\r\nher dried body remains as a sort of shell or cocoon for the protection\r\nof her young. When these are hatched, they soon make their way from\r\nbeneath the scaly covering, and commence feeding vigorously on the\r\njuices of the plant.\r\n\r\nTo the persevering exertions of a French gentleman, M. Thierry de\r\nMenonville, it was owing that the culture of the cochineal became known\r\nin the West India islands. This gentleman left Port au Prince, in St.\r\nDomingo, in January 1777, with the express object of procuring some\r\nliving cochineal insects of the finest sort from Mexico, and bringing\r\nthem for propagation in the French West India islands; an enterprise for\r\nthe expense of which the French government had allotted the sum of four\r\nthousand livres. Owing to the jealousy of the Spanish government, there\r\nwas great difficulty in penetrating as far as the cochineal districts,\r\nand M. Thierry pursued a plan to effect his object which cannot be\r\nconsidered justifiable, since it involved a departure from truth. At\r\nfirst he feigned ill health, and obtained permission to use the baths of\r\nthe river Magdalena; but, instead of going thither, he proceeded as fast\r\nas possible in the direction of the desired district, where he was\r\nsuccessful in getting some plants laden with cochineal, as a pretended\r\nremedy for gout. From his account of the expedition we gather the\r\nfollowing particulars.\r\n\r\nAfter numerous fatigues and dangers he at length saw himself near the\r\nend of his journey, and approached Guaxaca. At a village, within a short\r\ndistance of that place, he saw, for the first time in his life, and with\r\nthe utmost pleasure, the fine cochineal feeding on the nopal, or cactus,\r\nwhich it frequents. He saw a garden full of nopals, and not doubting but\r\nthat they were laden with cochineal insects, he sprang from his horse,\r\nand, under pretence of adjusting his stirrups, entered into conversation\r\nwith the Indian proprietor of the garden. He asked him with apparent\r\nindifference what was the use of those plants, and was answered, that\r\nthey were for the cultivation of _grana_. Feigning surprise, de\r\nMenonville asked to be permitted to see this grana, and he was really\r\nastonished when the insect was brought to him, for he had supposed it\r\nred, and it was in fact covered with a white powder. “My doubts,” he\r\nsays, “were tormenting, but I suddenly thought of the expedient of\r\ncrushing one upon white paper, when what did I see?—the true purple of\r\nkings!” Full of delight and anticipation, the traveller now set forward\r\ntowards the spot where he might hope to make himself acquainted with the\r\nculture of the precious insect, and purchase a store for transportation.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more beautiful than the situation of Guaxaca, capital\r\nof the province of that name. Standing in the midst of fertile and\r\nextensive plains, at the foot of a majestic mountain range, and watered\r\nby a fine and noble river, this city is richly supplied with corn and\r\nfruits of all kinds, at the same time that its environs supply a most\r\nfavourable site for the culture of the cochineal. The air, continually\r\nrefreshed by easterly breezes in the morning, and westerly in the\r\nevening, is pure and delicious, like that of a May morning. Indeed, our\r\ntraveller asserts, that for magnificence of site, beauty of decoration,\r\nexcellence of soil, fine temperature, and abundance of European and\r\nAmerican fruits succeeding each other without intermission, nothing is\r\nwanting to Guaxaca to make it an enchanting spot, but an active and\r\nindustrious people, to avail themselves of its natural advantages.\r\n\r\nAt Guaxaca de Menonville acted with caution, and did not betray any\r\nundue anxiety respecting the cochineals. Yet he provided himself with\r\nchests large enough for their conveyance together with the plants on\r\nwhich they fed. Under pretence of buying flowers, he went into a garden\r\nwhere there was a beautiful nopalerie, and while they were making up the\r\nbouquet he had ordered, he took the opportunity of observing the\r\narrangement of the nopals. They were planted four feet apart in lines,\r\nthe lines being six feet asunder. The nopalerie belonged to a negro, and\r\nit was here that a purchase might in all probability be effected. On\r\nanother occasion, therefore, de Menonville took two Indian servants,\r\neach bearing a large hamper, and repaired very early in the morning to\r\nthe garden. He left his servants at the entrance, and entered alone. The\r\nnegro proprietor had scarcely risen, but he came forward in a frank and\r\nagreeable manner. De Menonville then told him, that being a physician,\r\nhe was anxious to make an ointment of his own invention for the cure of\r\ngout, and for this purpose he wished to purchase some branches of nopals\r\nladen with cochineal, for which he was willing to pay whatever the owner\r\nshould demand, provided he might make his own selection of the branches\r\nsuitable to his purpose. The Indian willingly complied, and accordingly\r\nthe hampers were brought in, and eight fine branches, each two feet high\r\nand so loaded with cochineals as to be quite white, were speedily cut,\r\npacked, and covered with cloths. He then asked him how much he had to\r\npay; the negro answered that he could not possibly sell them for less\r\nthan two _reals_. Our traveller fully believed him, and would have\r\npurchased them, if necessary, at a much larger sum. That the negro might\r\nnot think him dissatisfied with the bargain, he gave him a piaster\r\n(value eight reals), telling him he had no change, and therefore he\r\nshould give him the rest to drink his health. The good old negro rubbed\r\nhis eyes, thinking he was still dreaming, and then loaded de Menonville\r\nwith thanks, while the latter brought in his two Indians, gave them the\r\nhampers to carry, and then set off as fast as possible. “My heart,” he\r\nsays, “beat quickly, for it seemed to me that I had carried off the\r\ngolden fleece, but might yet be pursued by the furious dragon who kept\r\nguard over it. All along the road I kept saying, ‘At last they are in my\r\npower;’ and I could willingly have sung for joy if I had not been afraid\r\nof being heard. I arrived at my inn quite out of breath, without having\r\nmet a single person in the streets; it was about sunrise; no one was\r\nawake in the house, and I crept quietly to my room, where I arranged my\r\nnopals, with inexpressible delight, in the caskets I had purchased for\r\nthat purpose.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  COCHINEAL CACTUS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAfter innumerable difficulties and dangers this traveller reached St.\r\nDomingo in safety, but with only a small part of his insects living.\r\nThese, however, he was successful in rearing and multiplying until a\r\nflourishing nopalerie was established. He found, by experience, that\r\nfive or six species of _cactus opuntia_ will nourish these insects, but\r\nthat some are far more valuable than others. He also proved that the\r\ncolours of the flowers and fruit of the plants, whether red, violet,\r\nyellow, or white, did not in any way affect the colour of the cochineal,\r\nnor indicate the greater or less aptitude of the plant to nourish the\r\ninsect. The thorny species were less convenient on account of the pain\r\nand annoyance to the hands of those who managed the nursery; but in some\r\nof these the younger branches were nearly free from prickles.\r\n\r\nThe terms _nopalerie_ for the nursery, and _nopal_ for the plant, are\r\npreserved among the French cultivators of cochineal, in remembrance of\r\nthe Mexican origin of such nurseries. The enclosure should be secured by\r\nwalls or a quick hedge; not from the fear that any animal will prey upon\r\nthe plants, since no large quadruped is known to have a taste for them;\r\nbut simply to keep out such as might by accident or fear be driven\r\nthrough the grounds, and trample on and destroy the crop.\r\n\r\nAn acre, or an acre and a half of land, when planted with nopals, is\r\nsufficient to keep one Indian well employed during six months of the\r\nyear. The plants should be so situated as to receive the full influence\r\nof the morning sun, which is of great consequence to the welfare of the\r\ncochineal. Every part of the ground should be as neat as a well-kept\r\ngarden, and every injurious insect watched for and destroyed. The spider\r\nalone is permitted to weave her nets in peace, and for this reason: she\r\nis the great enemy of many insects which injuriously affect the\r\ncochineals, while she herself does not touch one of them. The nopal\r\nrequires a good soil, where the drainage is excellent. Shelter from the\r\nwind, and exposure to the sun, are the two great requisites, and with\r\nthis there must be a tolerably settled climate, otherwise the harvest\r\nwill be uncertain.\r\n\r\nWhen in a favourable situation, the nopal requires less care and\r\ncultivation than almost any other plant: it would even appear that the\r\nless it is meddled with the better it succeeds. As soon as a nursery\r\nground is laid out, cleaned, and drained, planting commences, the season\r\nbeing the dry period just before the spring rains. Alleys or paths are\r\nmarked out, forming squares: parallel lines are drawn across these\r\nsquares north and south. Here the nopals are planted at two feet\r\ndistance from each other, being clean cuttings from the old plant, and\r\nnot torn or broken from it. The Indians of Guaxaca plant two or three\r\ncuttings in each hole, lest any accident should prevent one from\r\nstriking. Eighteen months afterwards the plants will be in a state to\r\nnourish the cochineal.\r\n\r\nThe sowing of cochineal, as it is called, is performed at day-break, the\r\ninsects being conveyed from the old plants and attached to the new. For\r\nthis purpose they are placed in little nests made by the natives, and\r\nattached with thorns to the leaves of the nopal. Here they quickly\r\nmultiply to an astonishing extent. A nopalerie is in perfection six\r\nyears, after which the insects are taken away and the plants cut down.\r\n\r\nThe cochineal harvest takes place every year as soon as the young\r\ninsects begin to run about. Assembling his friends, old and young, the\r\nowner of the cochineal ground enters it at break of day with a crowd of\r\nmen, women, and children, provided with knives six inches long and two\r\nwide, and also with dishes and with baskets. The blade of the knife is\r\nrounded at the top, so as to injure neither the insect nor the plant;\r\nthis is passed gently between the skin of the nopal and the clusters of\r\ncochineals with which it is covered, causing the latter to fall into the\r\ndish or basket, which the left hand holds ready to receive them. A child\r\nof ten years old may thus gather ten pounds of insects in a day, which\r\nbeing killed and dried will yield about three pounds and a half of\r\ncochineal. The best method of killing the insects is by pouring boiling\r\nwater on them, and allowing it to remain one, two, or three minutes. The\r\nwater is preserved, as it necessarily has some of the colouring matter\r\nof the insects; the latter are spread out to dry in the sun and wind,\r\nbeing turned occasionally by hand. Ten persons, it is said, can thus\r\nprepare two hundred pounds of cochineal in two days. Such is the history\r\ngiven by de Menonville himself, in his volumes entitled ‘_Voyage à\r\nGuaxaca_.’ Baron Humboldt, describing the management of cochineals in\r\nthis and in other parts of South America, gives some additional\r\nparticulars. He ascertained that in a colder climate, the colour of the\r\ncochineal is equally fine, but the harvests are more uncertain. Plains\r\nor valleys are generally more favourable to the rapid increase of the\r\ncochineals than elevated ground, but such places also abound in insect\r\nenemies, and in lizards, rats, and birds, which devour the crop. Great\r\ncare is required in clearing all the joints of the nopals: for this\r\npurpose Indian women use a squirrel’s or a stag’s tail, and will sit for\r\nhours crouched near a single plant. Notwithstanding the high price of\r\ncochineal, it is very doubtful whether the trade would answer in any\r\ncountry where labour is more valuable. In some parts of Guaxaca (called\r\nby Humboldt Oaxaca), they obtain three harvests of cochineal in the\r\nyear, the first being the least lucrative, because the bodies of the\r\ninsects yield very little colouring matter when they die naturally, and\r\nthis is the case at the first harvest, when they have just brought forth\r\ntheir young. Many of the negro proprietors of nopaleries, especially\r\nthose in the neighbourhood of Oaxaca, have a very ancient and singular\r\ncustom of making their cochineals emigrate during the rainy season. As\r\nthe Spaniard causes his flocks of merinos to emigrate on the approach of\r\ncold, so do these negroes send away their crop during a season which\r\nmight prove fatal to them. The insects are packed in hampers, and\r\ncarried as quickly as possible, on the backs of negroes, to a place nine\r\nleagues distant from the town, not so heavily visited with rain. Here\r\nthey distribute them on the nopals, and keep them there till the month\r\nof October, when they return with their freight, and replace it in the\r\nnopaleries of Oaxaca.\r\n\r\nThe plantations of cochineal cultivated by M. Thierry, at St. Domingo,\r\nwere so successful that in 1789 there were more than four thousand\r\nplants in a single nopalerie, and the produce was ascertained by\r\nchemists to be quite equal to that of Mexico; but at the time of the\r\nFrench Revolution, the political troubles of St. Domingo caused the\r\ndestruction of the plantations. Cochineal has been cultivated with some\r\nsuccess in several of the British West India islands. Thus the Rev. L.\r\nGuilding, writing a few years ago to Dr. Hooker, says, “I possess a\r\nconsiderable nursery of this cactus, inhabited by thousands of the true\r\n_Coccus cacti_, and I do not despair of being able to send to the\r\nSociety of Arts a large quantity of dried insects before the termination\r\nof the present year.”\r\n\r\nSo important was the acquisition of this insect to the East India\r\nCompany, that they offered a reward of six thousand pounds to any one\r\nwho should introduce it into India, where hitherto the Company had only\r\nsucceeded in procuring from Brazil the wild kind producing the\r\n_sylvestre_ cochineal, which is of inferior value. The true cochineal\r\ninsect, and the cactus on which it feeds, are said to have been of late\r\nyears successfully introduced into Spain and the French colony of\r\nAlgiers, and now exist in the stores of the _Jardin des Plantes_ at\r\nParis, and also in those of King Leopold at Claremont.\r\n\r\nStephens, in his Travels in Central America, does not omit to notice the\r\ncultivation of this insect, which was carried on extensively in the\r\nneighbourhood of the ruined city of La Antigua Guatimala. “Emerging from\r\nthe city,” he says, “we entered the open plain, shut in by mountains,\r\nand cultivated to their base with cochineal. At about a mile’s distance\r\nwe turned into the hacienda of Señor Vidaury. In the yard were four oxen\r\ngrinding sugar-cane, and behind was his nopal or cochineal plantation,\r\none of the largest in the Antigua. The plant is a species of cactus, set\r\nout in rows like Indian corn, and, at the time I speak of, it was about\r\nfour feet high. On every leaf was pinned with a thorn a piece of cane,\r\nin the hollow of which were thirty or forty insects. These insects\r\ncannot move, but breed, and the young crawl out and fasten upon the\r\nleaf. When they have once fixed, they never move; a light film gathers\r\nover them, and as they feed, the leaves become mildewed and white. At\r\nthe end of the dry season some of the leaves are cut off and hung up in\r\na storehouse for seed, the insects are brushed off from the rest and\r\ndried, and are then sent to minister to the luxuries and elegancies of\r\ncivilized life, and enliven with their bright colours the _salons_ of\r\nLondon, Paris, and St. Louis in Missouri. The crop is valuable, but\r\nuncertain, as an early rain may destroy it, and sometimes all the\r\nworkmen are taken away for soldiers at the moment when they are most\r\nneeded for its culture. The situation was ravishingly beautiful, at the\r\nbase and under the shade of the Volcano de Agua, and the view was\r\nbounded on all sides by mountains of perpetual green; the morning air\r\nwas soft and balmy, but pure and refreshing. With good government and\r\ngood laws, and one’s friends around, I never saw a more beautiful spot\r\non which man could desire to pass his allotted time on earth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  1. BRANCH COVERED WITH LAC. 2. SMALL TWIG LADEN WITH LAC. 3. PORTION\r\n    OF LAC (_magnified_). 4, 5, 6. LAC INSECT IN ITS SEVERAL FORMS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n               MANUFACTURE OF GUM LAC BY THE LAC INSECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother insect of the same family as the cochineal, prepares a substance\r\ncalled gum lac, which is used as a dye, and also as a varnish. This is\r\nthe lac insect, (_coccus lacca_,) found on several kinds of trees in the\r\nEast Indies, especially in the uncultivated mountains on both sides the\r\nGanges, where it is produced in such abundance, that were the\r\nconsumption ten times greater than it is, the markets might be readily\r\nsupplied. So great is the accumulation of these insects on the trees\r\nwhich they frequent, that the branches appear as if covered with red\r\ndust, and their sap is so much exhausted, that they wither and produce\r\nno fruit: the leaves also drop off, or turn to a blackish hue. The\r\ninsects fix themselves so close together, that it is supposed that not\r\nmore than one in six can have room to complete her cell. It is said they\r\nare transplanted from place to place by birds, which cannot perch upon\r\nthe branches without carrying off a number to the next place they rest\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nThe female, when about to lay her eggs, becomes completely glued to the\r\nbranch by a semi-pellucid liquid, which accumulates round the body, and\r\nhardens by exposure to the air. This is the gum lac, the original use of\r\nwhich is to form a cell for the young. When the eggs are laid, the\r\nparent insect becomes a mere lifeless bag of an oval shape, containing a\r\nsmall quantity of beautiful red liquid. On this liquid the young insects\r\nfeed as soon as they come to life; after which they pierce the cell, and\r\ncome forth one by one. Some small branches of _mimosa cinerea_, gathered\r\nwhen the lac was in a very fresh looking state, became covered with\r\nmyriads of exceedingly minute animals at the end of fourteen days. They\r\nissued from small holes over the surface of the cells, and when single\r\nran about pretty briskly; but in general they were so numerous as to be\r\ncrowded over one another. The cells themselves were very much like\r\namber; the outer portion was strong and resisting, but the partitions of\r\nthe interior were thinner, and formed irregular squares, pentagons, and\r\nhexagons, having no communication with each other.\r\n\r\nThere are four sorts of lac known in commerce, but these are only so\r\nmany different preparations of the same substance. Stick lac is the lac\r\nin its natural state, with much of the woody parts of the branches\r\nadhering to it: this is collected in the East twice a year, the only\r\ntrouble being to break off the twigs and branches, and take them to the\r\nnearest market, with the lac upon them; or, if destined for exportation,\r\nthe lac is separated from the larger branches for convenience of\r\nfreight.\r\n\r\nSeed lac is the second description known in commerce. This is a\r\ncollection of granules, obtained from the former after the colouring\r\nmatter has been extracted by water, but this is seldom imported, being\r\nmanufactured into shell lac in India. Lump lac is the third form, being\r\nmerely the granules further purified and made into lumps. Lastly, there\r\nis shell lac, in which the substance is purified to the utmost by being\r\nput in bags and held over a fire until sufficiently melted to pass\r\nthrough the pores of the linen. The bags are then pressed and squeezed\r\nat the same time that they are passed over a smooth surface of wood,\r\nthus depositing the lac in thin layers. The fineness and purity of the\r\nlac will of course depend on the fineness of the bag through which it is\r\npassed. Shell lac if pure will take fire when laid on a hot iron, and\r\nwill burn with a strong but not disagreeable smell. The heat of the\r\nship’s hold is very apt to run this commodity into a solid mass, in\r\nwhich case its value is much depreciated.\r\n\r\nThe different kinds of lac are largely used by Indians for ornamental\r\npurposes. Of the lump lac they make _bangles_, or armlets for women of\r\nthe lower class; shell lac being employed for the same kind of ornaments\r\nfor the upper classes, and also for beads, chains, necklaces, and other\r\nadornments. They also make a good varnish by melting the lac, colouring\r\nit with cinnabar or some other pigment, and making it into sticks like\r\nour sealing wax. The box, cabinet, or other article about to be\r\nvarnished, is made hot by a charcoal fire, and then rubbed over with a\r\nstick of lac, the surface being afterwards smoothed with a piece of\r\nfolded plantain leaf to make it equal. A similar varnish is often used\r\non images and ornamental figures. The religious houses of the Indians\r\nare often adorned with very thin beaten lead, coloured with various\r\nvarnishes made from lac. The leaf of lead is laid upon a smooth heated\r\niron while the varnish is being applied.\r\n\r\nLac is also extensively used as a dye. By pouring warm water on stick\r\nlac, a crimson solution is obtained, which is the source of much of the\r\nvalue attached to lac. This colouring matter is extracted in various\r\nways, and made into small square cakes for sale; these go by the names\r\nof lac dye, lac lake, or cake lake. When broken, the cakes are dark\r\ncoloured, shining, smooth and compact, and when scraped or powdered they\r\npresent a bright red colour approaching carmine. The native mode of\r\ndyeing with this substance is described as follows. They take one gallon\r\nof the red liquid, and add to it three ounces of alum. Three or four\r\nounces of tamarinds are boiled in a gallon of water and strained. Equal\r\nparts of the red liquid and of the tamarind water are then mixed over a\r\nbrisk fire; and the pieces of silk or cotton cloth to be dyed are dipped\r\nand wrung alternately, until they have received a proper proportion of\r\nthe dye. To deepen the colour they increase the proportion of the red\r\nliquid, and lengthen the time during which the cloth remains immersed in\r\nit. The colour is rendered permanent by the use of bark in the rinsing\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThere is yet another and a singular employment of lac among the Indians.\r\nThe polishing grindstones used by eastern lapidaries are composed of a\r\nmixture of three parts river sand with one part lac: these are mixed in\r\na vessel over the fire, and then formed into the shape of a grindstone;\r\nthe part of the lac being merely that of a cement to hold the sand\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn this country lac is valuable partly as a dye, partly as a varnish. As\r\na dye it is less beautiful, but more durable than cochineal. It forms\r\nthe best kinds of sealing wax, and is also used in the hat manufacture.\r\n\r\nWith regard to its use as a dyeing drug we find the following remarks in\r\nthe Entomology of Kirby and Spence. “It has been employed to impart a\r\nblood red or crimson dye to cloth from the earliest ages, and was known\r\nto the Phœnicians before the time of Moses, under the name of _Tola_ or\r\n_Thola_, to the Greeks under that of _Coccus_, and to the Arabians and\r\nPersians under that of _Kermes_ or _Alkermes_; whence, as Beckmann has\r\nshown, and from the epithet _vermiculatum_ given to it in the middle\r\nages, when it was ascertained to be the produce of a worm, have sprung\r\nup the Latin _coccineus_, the French _cramoisi_ and _vermeil_, and our\r\n_crimson_ and _vermilion_. It was most probably with this substance that\r\nthe curtains of the tabernacle (Exodus xxvi.) were dyed deep red, (which\r\nthe word scarlet, as our translators have rendered it, then implied, not\r\nthe colour now so called, which was not known in James the First’s\r\nreign, when the Bible was translated;)—it was with this that the\r\nGrecians and Romans produced their crimson; and from the same source\r\nwere derived the imperishable reds of the Brussels and Flemish schools.\r\nIn short, previous to the discovery of cochineal, this was the material\r\nuniversally used for dyeing the most brilliant red then known; and\r\nthough that production of the New World has, in some respects\r\nundeservedly, supplanted it in Europe, where it is little attended to\r\nexcept by the peasantry of the provinces in which it is found, it still\r\ncontinues to be employed in great part of India and Persia.\r\n\r\nSome other insects besides the cochineal and lac insects are found to\r\nproduce dyes. The galls of a peculiar species of aphis are used in the\r\nLevant, Persia and China, for dyeing silk crimson, and it is thought\r\nthat the galls of another species of this insect, common on the fir\r\ntrees of this country, might be employed for a similar purpose. A\r\nspecies of mite is employed in Guinea and Surinam as a dye, and it is\r\nsuggested that the beautiful little dazzling red mite which is common\r\nhere, might also yield a valuable tincture. Réaumur has even suggested\r\nthat water colours of beautiful tints not otherwise easily attainable,\r\nmight be procured by feeding the common clothes-moth on different\r\ncoloured wools. The excrement of this insect always retains the colour\r\nof the substance forming the food, and mixes well with water to form a\r\npigment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  NUT GALLS AND THE GALL INSECT.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n              MANUFACTURE OF NUT GALLS BY THE GALL INSECT.\r\n\r\n\r\n“No present that insects have made to the arts is equal in utility and\r\nuniversal interest, comes more home to our best affections, or is the\r\ninstrument of producing more valuable fruits of human wisdom and genius,\r\nthan the gall insect: I mean the fly that gives birth to the gall-nut,\r\nfrom which ink is made. How infinitely are we indebted to this little\r\ncreature, which at once enables us to converse with our absent friends\r\nand connexions, be their distance from us ever so great, and supplies\r\nthe means by which, to use the poet’s language, we can\r\n\r\n                    “——give to airy nothing\r\n                    A local habitation, and a name!”\r\n\r\nenabling the poet, the philosopher, and the divine, to embody their\r\nthoughts for the amusement, instruction, direction, and reformation of\r\nmankind.”[3]\r\n\r\nFootnote 3:\r\n\r\n  Kirby and Spence.\r\n\r\nThe oak which furnishes this gall is common throughout Asia Minor, from\r\nthe Bosphorus to Syria, and from the shores of the Archipelago to\r\nPersia. It is more frequently seen under the form of a shrub than a\r\ntree, rarely attaining six feet in height. Its leaves are smooth,\r\ntoothed at the edges, of a clear green on both sides, and having a very\r\nshort leaf-stalk; they fall every year, at the end of autumn. The acorn\r\nis two or three times longer than its cup, the latter is sessile,\r\nslightly downy, and furnished with small scales. The gall is hard,\r\nwoody, and heavy, growing out of the buds of young branches, and\r\nacquiring a diameter of from four lines to an inch. It is generally\r\nround, and covered with knots, some of which are pointed.\r\n\r\nThis gall-nut is much more valuable if gathered before it is ripe, that\r\nis to say, before the insect which produced it has made its escape. In\r\nthis state it has a bluish appearance, and is unperforated; whereas\r\nthose from which the insect has departed are lighter in colour and in\r\nweight, and are less useful in dyeing.\r\n\r\nThe Orientals are very careful to gather in this crop at the exact time\r\nwhich experience has proved to be the best, namely, that in which the\r\nexcrescence has attained its greatest size and weight. If there is any\r\ndelay, the insect undergoes its metamorphosis, pierces the shell, and\r\nappears under its form of a winged insect. From this time the gall-nut\r\nno longer derives from the tree those juices which were necessary for\r\nthe nourishment of the insect, but dries up, and loses the greater part\r\nof those qualities which make it valuable in commerce. The Aga of the\r\ndistrict takes care that the cultivators traverse frequently, at the\r\ntime of the harvest, the hills and mountains which are covered with this\r\noak. He has an interest in obtaining galls of good quality, because he\r\nlevies a tax on the produce. The first gatherings are set aside; they\r\nare known in the East under the name of _yerli_, and are called in\r\ncommerce _black galls_, and _green galls_. Those which have escaped the\r\nfirst search, and which are gathered a little later, are named _white\r\ngalls_, and are of a very inferior quality.\r\n\r\nThe galls from Mossoul and Tocat, and in general those which come from\r\nthe eastern part of Turkey, are less valued than those from the\r\nneighbourhood of Aleppo, of Smyrna, Magnesia, Diarbekir, and all the\r\ninterior of Natolia.\r\n\r\nThe acorns of this oak are nearly always neglected; being left as\r\npasturage for goats and wild boars: this it is thought contributes much\r\nto render the oak small and stunted, because in devouring the fruit,\r\nthese animals also consume a part of its foliage and young branches.\r\n\r\nThe body of the insect which produces the gall-nut, is of a fawn colour,\r\nwith obscure antennæ; the abdomen is shining brown. It is sometimes\r\nfound in its perfect form in the interior of the nut.\r\n\r\nOn the same oak are frequently found a great number of other galls,\r\nwhich are not gathered, because they are of no use in dyeing. One of\r\nthese is represented in the frontispiece to this chapter, and is\r\nremarkable for its large size. It is spongy, very light, of a reddish\r\nbrown colour, and covered with a resinous matter. It is also furnished\r\nwith a circular range of tubercles, placed near its greatest\r\ncircumference. This is produced by a different insect, called by Olivier\r\n_Diplolepis gallæ resinosæ_; a figure of which is also given on the\r\nright hand side.\r\n\r\nGall-flies of various kinds attack our oak trees in this country, and\r\nalso our willows, hawthorns, roses, &c. A few words respecting the\r\nexcrescences they produce, may therefore assist our ideas of the\r\nproceedings of the valuable insect described above. Very few persons are\r\nunacquainted with oak-apples, or small roundish, flattened bodies\r\ngrowing on the leaves of the oak. These are sometimes tinged with brown,\r\nor pink, or pale yellow, so as to appear not much unlike very small\r\napples, attached to the leaf. Each of these curious bodies is formed by\r\na small fly of the same nature as that which forms the gall-nut. This\r\ninsect alights on the leaf, pierces it with a very sharp instrument with\r\nwhich she is provided for this purpose, and deposits an egg so minute as\r\nto be almost invisible to the human eye. The puncture of this insect\r\nproduces a diseased action in the leaf, so that the parts immediately\r\nsurrounding the egg swell and harden until the apple-shaped body is\r\nproduced. This is now an admirable place of shelter, and a reservoir of\r\nfood for the insect within, which remains snugly encased until it\r\narrives at its perfect state, when it cuts its way out through the solid\r\nsubstance of the gall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LEAF GALLS.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  OAK SPANGLE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThis is only one out of many forms of gall that may be found on the oak,\r\nwhere sometimes the leaf is attached, sometimes the catkin, and\r\nsometimes the young bud. Another form of that on the leaf consists of\r\nvery small circular discs fixed to the under part by their central\r\npoints. The outer side of the disc is red and hairy, the inner side\r\nsmooth. Each disc contains a single insect, which remains in it long\r\nafter the leaves have fallen to the ground. The common name of this\r\ncurious excrescence is “oak spangle.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CURRANT GALLS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nStill more singular is the gall found in the catkins of the oak. The\r\nflies deposit their eggs in the stalk of the stamen-bearing flowers,\r\nwhich in consequence become adorned with what appear to be straggling\r\nbunches of currants or bird-cherries. Placed at short distances from\r\neach other on the thread-like stem, these excrescences so much resemble\r\ncurrants in size, shape, and mode of growth, that they have been named\r\n“currant galls.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ARTICHOKE-GALL.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAmong the species of gall to which our oaks are subject, there are some\r\nwhich grow at the end of the twig, as for instance, that called the\r\nartichoke-gall, which comes the nearest in appearance to the nut-gall of\r\ncommerce, since it is, in common with that nut, an irregular\r\ndevelopment, not of the leaf or flower, but of the bud. The\r\nartichoke-gall might indeed be easily mistaken for the fruit of the\r\ntree, by any one unacquainted with the habit of the oak. It is a\r\ncone-like body, consisting of a number of leafy scales overlapping each\r\nother, but on being dissected it is found, like other galls, to contain\r\ninsects in various stages of their growth, according to the season. In\r\nthe same way, the nut-gall, being a disease of the bud, or extremity of\r\nthe young shoots of the oak on which it grows, has the appearance common\r\nto some other kinds of fruit, and would seem to be the ordinary produce\r\nof the stalk, did we not find that acorns also grow on the same tree.\r\nThe hard and brittle texture of the gall-nut also, so different from the\r\nsubstance of our own oak-galls, would be still more likely to deceive,\r\nand indeed has deceived a highly respectable writer, who declares from\r\nhis observation of the dried galls of commerce, that the nut is the\r\nfruit of a tree, and not a mere excrescence.[4]\r\n\r\nFootnote 4:\r\n\r\n  Aikin.\r\n\r\nHow it is that the different species of gall-fly should produce such\r\nvaried results, and why one excrescence should be the oak-apple, another\r\nthe spangle, a third the artichoke, and a fourth the nut, is indeed a\r\nmystery. But that these small insects do really produce the excrescences\r\nin question, is an ascertained fact, and a most important one in the\r\ncommercial world.\r\n\r\nNut galls contain a large quantity of the vegetable principle called\r\n_tannin_, being the astringent property for which oak-bark is in so much\r\nrepute. They also abound in an acid called from thence _gallic acid_,\r\nwhich is the important ingredient in black dyes, and in fixing and\r\nimproving several other colours, as well as in the composition of ink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  BLISTERING BEETLE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                OTHER INSECT PRODUCTIONS USEFUL TO MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost any article could be better spared from the materia medica, than\r\nan insect remedy called _cantharides_, or Spanish flies. This consists\r\nof the bodies of small beetles, in which resides an active blistering\r\nprinciple of great importance, not only as an external application, but\r\nalso sometimes as an internal remedy. The insect chiefly used in Europe\r\nis the _cantharis vesicatoria_, for the most part rare in England, but\r\nseen on some occasions in great numbers, as in the summer of 1837 in\r\nEssex, Suffolk, and the Isle of Wight. Other insects of the same family\r\nare employed in foreign countries.\r\n\r\nThe true blistering beetle has complete wings and wing cases; its body\r\nis long and narrow, varying in size, but in general about nine lines\r\nlong and two or three lines wide. It is of a rich green and golden\r\ncolour, very shining and delicately tinctured, with the antennæ black,\r\nexcept the first joint.\r\n\r\n“The cantharis is one of those insects which have been most anciently\r\nand most universally known. Physicians, who were the first natural\r\nphilosophers, and the first observers of nature, have made mention of\r\nthe cantharides in the remotest times. But they have only considered\r\nthem under that relation which was most suitable to their own\r\nprofession, and as furnishing to medicine one of its most powerful\r\nagents. The naturalist, who is less anxious about becoming acquainted\r\nwith the medicinal virtues of the dead, than with the peculiar habits of\r\nthe living cantharides, is yet very far from having acquired in this\r\nrespect extensive and satisfactory information. The only species which\r\nhas been deemed to be endowed with useful properties, has caused a\r\nforgetfulness of all the others which compose the entire genus; and all\r\nthat we know in general respecting these insects, is that in our\r\nEuropean climates they live on plants, devour the leaves of certain\r\ntrees, shun the cold, appear at the commencement of spring, and\r\ndisappear at the beginning of autumn. * * * It is more than probable\r\nthat experiments on insects relatively to their utility in medicine and\r\nthe arts, have been too much neglected in general. Their diminutive size\r\nhas doubtless caused them to be too much despised. It cannot however be\r\ndoubted, that there must be a great number of them whose virtues are at\r\nleast equal to those of the cantharides, and many others which are less\r\nacrid and less caustic might in many cases be taken internally, with\r\nless danger and a greater chance of success.”\r\n\r\nThe early history of this insect is not well known. The female buries\r\nher eggs in the ground; the larvæ have a soft body of a yellowish white\r\ncolour; they live in the earth, and feed on various roots. When full\r\ngrown they change into the nymph state in the earth, and do not emerge\r\nfrom it until they have assumed the perfect insect form.\r\n\r\nThey are very abundant in Spain and in the South of France, especially\r\nin June, when they assemble in swarms. This is the time for gathering\r\nthem, and the hour of sunset or sunrise is chosen for the purpose, as\r\nthey are then in a somewhat torpid state. They are found upon ash-trees,\r\nhoney-suckles, lilacs, rose-trees, poplars, elms, &c., the leaves of\r\nwhich they devour, and when this food fails they attack corn and grass,\r\nand do much damage. The swarms are preceded by a fœtid odour resembling\r\nthat of _mice_. They are gathered in various ways; the most simple is to\r\nspread cloths under the tree upon which a swarm has settled, and then to\r\nshake them down; they are afterwards collected upon a hair sieve, and\r\nheld over the vapour of boiling vinegar, which kills them; or the cloth\r\nin which they are collected may be folded loosely up and dipped in\r\nvinegar, which has the same effect. Another method is to boil a quantity\r\nof vinegar under the tree where they are collected, and the ascending\r\nvapour kills them.\r\n\r\nThe particles emitted by these insects are so very corrosive that\r\npersons are liable to be violently affected who attempt to gather them\r\nwith bare hands during the heat of the day. It is also dangerous to be\r\nunder a tree where a swarm has gathered. Persons who collect them should\r\nalways wear a mask and gloves.\r\n\r\nAfter the insects are killed they must be dried; this is done in the sun\r\nor in a heated room, upon tiles covered with cloth or paper. They are\r\nmoved about from time to time with a stick, or with the hands furnished\r\nwith gloves. When properly dry they are so light that fifty weigh\r\nscarcely a drachm.\r\n\r\nThey are packed in boxes or barrels lined with paper and perfectly dry.\r\nIf damp gets to them they contract a detestable odour, and are unfit for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nA portion of our supply of cantharides is from Astracan and Sicily: but\r\nthe greatest quantity is from St. Petersburgh, the Russian insects being\r\nsuperior to those of Sicily and France.\r\n\r\nIn using cantharides they are reduced to powder, mixed with some fatty\r\nsubstance, and applied in the form of a plaster to the surface of the\r\nbody: it begins to act immediately, and separates the outer skin from\r\nthe dermis with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nA singular employment of insects in the composition of _soap_ is made in\r\nsome parts of Africa. Geoffrey the younger relates, that being at the\r\nvillage of Postudal, some leagues from Senegal, in search of insects,\r\none of the negroes whom he had employed in the same pursuit brought him\r\na vessel containing an immense quantity of a small species of carabus,\r\nand informed him that this insect entered into the composition of the\r\nsoap used in that country; at the same time he exhibited a ball of a\r\ndark-coloured soap, the properties of which are similar to the soap used\r\nin Europe. It appears that the insect abounds in alkali, which makes it\r\nuseful for the purpose in question.\r\n\r\nThe following figure of the soap insect (_Carabus saponarius_), is\r\ncopied from M. Olivier’s large work on insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [Soap Insect]]\r\n\r\nAnother useful insect substance is a kind of resin, or more properly\r\nspeaking, wax, which by adulteration with a resinous substance is made\r\nheavier for the market. This is found in the province of Coquimbo, South\r\nAmerica, and is the production of a caterpillar, which feeds on a shrub\r\ncalled _chilca_, a species of origanum. The caterpillars are of a red\r\ncolour, and about half an inch in length. They appear in great numbers\r\nin the beginning of the spring on the branches of the chilca, where they\r\nform their cells of a kind of soft wax. In these they become changed\r\ninto a small yellowish moth, with black stripes upon the wings. The wax\r\nis at first very white, by degrees becomes yellow, and finally brown;\r\nthis change, and the bitter taste which it acquires, is supposed to be\r\nowing to the fogs which are very frequent in the provinces where it is\r\nfound. It is collected in autumn by the inhabitants, who boil it in\r\nwater, and afterwards make it up into little cakes, in which form it is\r\nbrought to market. In order to increase its weight, many are accustomed\r\nto mix it with the resin obtained from another resinous shrub, and in\r\nthis state great quantities are sold to ship-masters, who use it for\r\npaying their vessels.\r\n\r\nUpon the branches of the wild rosemary is also found a whitish viscous\r\nsubstance, in globules of the size of a hazel-nut, containing a very\r\nlimpid oil, which proceeds from the shrub. These glands serve for the\r\nhabitation of a kind of caterpillar, which becomes transformed into a\r\nsmall fly, with four brown wings, of the genus _Cynips_.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing details will be sufficient to show that we are indebted in\r\nno small degree to the labours of insects for comfort, convenience, and\r\nhealth. It becomes us then to receive not unthankfully the benefits they\r\nconfer, while we view them as the agents of a higher power, under whose\r\ndirection they work with ceaseless activity in their humble sphere, and\r\nproduce results, not less astonishing in themselves, than valuable and\r\nbeneficial to mankind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FINIS]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 LONDON\r\n                  R.
