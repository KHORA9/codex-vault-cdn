We have grown to regard it as the emblem of sorrow.  We\r\nhave named it the \"weeping willow,\" and draped the tomb with its soft\r\npale fronds, as with a winding-sheet of silver.\r\n\r\nFar different are the feelings inspired by the sight of this beautiful\r\ntree amid the _karoos_ of Southern Africa.  That is a land where springs\r\nand streams are \"few and far between;\" and the _weeping_ willow--sure\r\nsign of the presence of water--is no longer the emblem of sorrow, but\r\nthe symbol of joy.\r\n\r\nJoy reigns in the camp under its shade by the banks of the noble Orange\r\nRiver, as is proved by the continuous peals of laughter that ring clear\r\nand loud upon the air, and echo from the opposite shores of the stream.\r\n\r\nWho are they that laugh so loudly and cheerfully?  _The young yagers_.\r\n\r\nAnd who are the young yagers?\r\n\r\nLet us approach their camp and see for ourselves.  It is night, but the\r\nblaze of the camp-fire will enable us to distinguish all of them, as\r\nthey are all seated around it.  By its light we can take their\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\nThere are six of them--a full \"set of six,\" and not one appears to be\r\nyet twenty years of age.  They are all boys between the ages of ten and\r\ntwenty--though two or three of them, and, maybe, more than that number,\r\nthink themselves quite men.\r\n\r\nThree of the party you will recognise at a glance as old acquaintances.\r\nThey are no other than Hans, Hendrik, and Jan, our _ci-devant_\r\n\"Bush-boys.\"\r\n\r\nIt is several years since we saw them last, and they have grown a good\r\ndeal since then; but none of them has yet reached the full stature of\r\nmanhood.  Though no longer \"Bush-boys,\" they are yet only boys; and Jan,\r\nwho used to be called \"little Jan,\" still merits and receives that\r\ndistinctive appellation.  It would stretch Jan to his utmost to square\r\noff against a four-foot measuring-stick; and he could only manage it by\r\nstanding upon the very tips of his toes.\r\n\r\nHans has grown taller, but, perhaps, thinner and paler.  For two years\r\nhe has been at college, where he has been very busy with his books, and\r\nhas greatly distinguished himself by carrying off the first prizes in\r\neverything.  Upon Hendrik there is a decided change.  He has outgrown\r\nhis elder brother both in length and breadth, and comes very near\r\nlooking like a full-grown man.  He is yet but eighteen years old,\r\nstraight as a rush, with a decided military air and gait.  The last is\r\nnot to be wondered at, as Hendrik has now been a cornet in the Cape\r\nMounted Rifles for more than a year, and still holds that commission, as\r\nmay be learnt by looking at his forage-cap, with its golden embroidery\r\nover the peak.  So much for our old acquaintances the \"Bush-boys!\"\r\n\r\nBut who are the other three that share with them the circle of the\r\ncamp-fire?  Who are their companions? for they are evidently on terms of\r\ncompanionship, and friendship too.  Who are they?  A word or two will\r\ntell that.  They are the _Van Wyks_.  The three sons of Diedrik Van Wyk.\r\n\r\nAnd who, then, is Diedrik Van Wyk?  That must also be explained.\r\nDiedrik is a very rich boor--a \"vee-boor\"--who every night shuts up\r\nwithin his spacious _kraals_ more than three thousand horses and horned\r\ncattle, with five times that number of sheep and goats!  In fact,\r\nDiedrik Van Wyk is accounted the richest vee-boor, or grazier, in all\r\nthe Graaf Reinet.\r\n\r\nNow the broad _plaatz_, or farm, of Diedrik Van Wyk lies contiguous to\r\nthat of our old acquaintance, Hendrik Von Bloom; and it so chances that\r\nHendrik and Diedrik are fast friends and inseparable companions.  They\r\nsee each other once a-day, at the least.  Every evening Hendrik rides\r\nover to the \"kraal\" of Diedrik, or Diedrik to that of Hendrik, to enjoy\r\na smoke together out of their ponderous pipes of meerschaum, or a\r\n\"zoopje\" of _brandewyn_ distilled from their own peaches.  They are, in\r\nfact, a pair of regular old comrades,--for Van Wyk in early life has\r\nseen military service as well as Von Bloom,--and, like all old soldiers,\r\nthey love to repeat their camp stories, and \"fight their battles o'er\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances it is not to be wondered at, that the children\r\nof both should be intimate acquaintances.  But, in addition to the\r\nfriendship of their fathers, there is a tie of relationship between the\r\ntwo families,--the two mothers were cousins,--so that the children are\r\nwhat is usually termed second cousins,--a very interesting sort of\r\naffinity.  And it is not an unlikely thing that the relationship between\r\nthe families of Von Bloom and his friend Van Wyk may one day become\r\nstill closer and more interesting; for the former has for his daughter,\r\nas all the world knows, the beautiful flaxen-haired cherry-cheeked\r\nTruey, while the latter is the father of the pretty brunette\r\nWilhelmina--also an only daughter.  Now there chance to be three boys in\r\neach family; and though both boys and girls are by far too young to\r\nthink of getting married yet, there are suspicions abroad that the\r\nfamilies of Von Bloom and Van Wyk will, at no very distant day, be\r\nconnected by a double marriage--which would not be displeasing to either\r\nof the old comrades, Hendrik and Diedrik.\r\n\r\nI have said there are three boys in each family.  You already know the\r\nVon Blooms, Hans, Hendrik, and Jan.  Allow me to introduce you to the\r\nVan Wyks.  Their names are Willem, Arend, and Klaas.\r\n\r\nWillem is the eldest, and, though not yet eighteen, is quite a man in\r\nsize.  Willem is, in fact, a boy of very large dimensions, so large that\r\nhe has received the _sobriquet_ of \"Groot Willem\" (Big William)\r\ntherefrom.  All his companions call him \"Groot Willem.\"  But he is\r\nstrong in proportion to his size,--by far the strongest of the young\r\nyagers.  He is by no means tidy in his dress.  His clothes, consisting\r\nof a big jacket of homespun cloth, a check shirt, and an enormously wide\r\npair of leathern trousers, hang loosely about him, and make him look\r\nlarger than he really is.  Even his broad-brimmed felt hat has a\r\nslouching set upon his head, and his _feldtschoenen_ are a world too\r\nwide for his feet.\r\n\r\nAnd just as easy as his dress is the disposition of the wearer.  Though\r\nstrong as a lion, and conscious of his strength, Groot Willem would not\r\nharm a fly, and his kindly and unselfish nature makes him a favourite\r\nwith all.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem is a mighty hunter, carries one of the largest of guns, a\r\nregular Dutch \"roer,\" and also an enormous powder-horn, and pouch full\r\nof leaden bullets.  An ordinary boy would stagger under such a load, but\r\nit is nothing to Groot Willem.\r\n\r\nNow it may be remembered that Hendrik Von Bloom is also a \"mighty\r\nhunter;\" and I shall just whisper that a slight feeling of rivalry--I\r\nshall not call it jealousy, for they are good friends--exists between\r\nthese two Nimrods.  Hendrik's favourite gun is a rifle, while the roer\r\nof Groot Willem is a \"smooth bore;\" and between the merits of these two\r\nweapons camp-fire discussions are frequent and sharp.  They are never\r\ncarried beyond the limits of gentlemanly feeling, for loose and slovenly\r\nas is Groot Willem in outward appearance, he is a gentleman within.\r\n\r\nEqually a gentleman, but of far more taste and style, is the second\r\nbrother of the Van Wyks, Arend.  In striking appearance and manly beauty\r\nhe is quite a match for Hendrik Von Bloom himself, though in complexion\r\nand features there is no resemblance between them.  Hendrik is fair,\r\nwhile Arend is very dark-skinned, with black eyes and hair.  In fact,\r\nall the Van Wyks are of the complexion known as \"brunette,\" for they\r\nbelong to that section of the inhabitants of Holland sometimes\r\ndistinguished as \"Black Dutch.\"  But upon Arend's fine features the hue\r\nsits well, and a handsomer youth is not to be seen in all the Graaf\r\nReinet.  Some whisper that this is the opinion of the beautiful Gertrude\r\nVon Bloom; but that can only be idle gossip, for the fair Truey is yet\r\nbut thirteen, and therefore can have no opinion on such a matter.\r\nAfrica, however, is an early country, and there _might_ be something in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nArend's costume is a tasty one, and becomes him well.  It consists of a\r\njacket of dressed antelope-skin,--the skin of the springbok; but this,\r\nbesides being tastefully cut and sewed, is very prettily embroidered\r\nwith slashes of beautiful leopard-skin, while broad bands of the same\r\nextend along the outside seams of the trousers, from waist to ankle,\r\ngiving to the whole dress, a very rich and striking effect.  Arend's\r\nhead-dress is similar to that worn by Hendrik Von Bloom, viz: a military\r\nforage-cap, upon the front of which are embroidered in gold bullion a\r\nbugle and some letters; and the explanation of that is, that Arend, like\r\nhis second cousin, is a cornet in the Cape Rifles, and a dashing young\r\nsoldier he is.\r\n\r\nNow the portrait of Klaas in pen and ink.--Klaas is just Jan's age and\r\nJan's exact height, but as to circumference therein exists a great\r\ndifference.  Jan, as you all know, is a thin, wiry little fellow, while\r\nKlaas, on the contrary, is broad, stout, and burly.  In fact, so stout\r\nis he, that Jan repeated two and a half times would scarce equal him in\r\ndiameter!\r\n\r\nBoth wear cloth roundabouts and trousers, and little broad-brimmed hats;\r\nboth go to the same school; and, though there is a considerable\r\ndifference between them in other respects, both are great boys for\r\nbird-catching and all that sort of thing.  As they only carry small\r\nshot-guns, of course they do not aspire to killing antelopes or other\r\nlarge animals; but, small as their guns are, I pity the partridge,\r\nguinea-hen, or even bustard, that lets either of them crawl within reach\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nNow it has been hinted that between the hunters Groot Willem and Hendrik\r\nthere is a slight feeling of rivalry in regard to matters of _venerie_.\r\nA very similar feeling, spiced perhaps with a little bit of jealousy,\r\nhas long existed between the bird-catchers, and sometimes leads to a\r\nlittle coolness between them, but that is usually of very short\r\nduration.\r\n\r\nHans and Arend have no envious feelings--either of one another or of\r\nanybody else.  Hans is too much of a philosopher: besides, the\r\naccomplishment in which he excels, the knowledge of natural history, is\r\none in which he is without a rival.  None of the rest make any\r\npretensions to such knowledge; and the opinion of Hans on any matter of\r\nscience is always regarded as a final judgment.\r\n\r\nAs to Arend, he is not particularly proud of any acquirement.  Handsome,\r\nbrave, and generous, he is nevertheless a right modest youth,--a boy to\r\nbe beloved.\r\n\r\nAnd now you know who are the _young yagers_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWO.\r\n\r\nSWARTBOY THE BUSHMAN AND CONGO THE KAFFIR.\r\n\r\nI have said that the young yagers were encamped on the southern bank of\r\nthe Great Orange River.  What were they doing there?  The spot they\r\noccupied was many a long day's journey from their home in the Graaf\r\nReinet, and many a day's journey beyond the frontier of the Cape Colony.\r\nThere were no settlements near.  No white men ever wandered so far,\r\nexcept an occasional \"smouse,\" or trader--a class of men who extend\r\ntheir bartering expeditions almost to the central parts of the African\r\nContinent.  Sometimes, too, the \"trek-boor,\" or nomade grazier, may have\r\ndriven his flocks to this remote place, but for all that it could not be\r\nconsidered a settled country.  It was still a wilderness.\r\n\r\nAnd what were the young Von Blooms and Van Wyks doing in the wilderness?\r\n_Jaging_ to be sure, and nothing else,--they were simply out on a\r\nhunting expedition.\r\n\r\nIt was an expedition that had been long talked of and planned.  Since\r\ntheir grand hunt of the elephant, the \"Bush-boys\" had not followed any\r\ngame.  Hendrik had been with his regiment, and Hans and Jan busy with\r\ntheir respective studies.  So with Arend Van Wyk as with Hendrik, and\r\nKlaas as with Jan.  Groot Willem alone, from time to time, had been\r\njaging springboks and such other game as is to be found among the\r\nsettlements.  But the present was a grand expedition intended to be\r\ncarried far beyond the settled part of the colony--in fact, as far as\r\nthey thought fit to go.  The boys had received the full sanction of\r\ntheir parents, and had been fitted out in proper style--each having a\r\ngood horse, and each three a large wagon to carry all their camp\r\nutensils, and serve as a tent to sleep in.  Each wagon had its driver,\r\nand full span of ten long-horned oxen; and these, with a small pack of\r\nrough-looking _buck-dogs_, might be seen in the camp--the oxen tied to\r\nthe disselbooms of the wagons, and the dogs grouped in various attitudes\r\naround the fire.  The horses were also fastened some to the wheels, and\r\nothers to trees that grew near.\r\n\r\nTwo other objects in the camp are well worthy of a word or two; in fact,\r\nthey are two individuals of very great importance to the expedition--as\r\nwithout them the wagons would be a troublesome affair.  They are the\r\ndrivers of these vehicles, and each is as proud of his whip-craft as\r\nJehu could possibly have been of his.\r\n\r\nIn one of these drivers you will recognise an old acquaintance.  The\r\nlarge head and high cheek-bones, with the flat spread nostrils between;\r\nthe small oblique Mongolian eyes; the short curly wool-knots, planted\r\nsparsely over the broad skull; the yellow complexion; the thick \"chunky\"\r\nform, scarce four feet in height, and sparely clad in red flannel shirt\r\nand brown leathern \"crackers;\" with all these features and characters\r\nbefore your mind, you cannot fail to recognise an old favourite--the\r\nBushman, _Swartboy_.\r\n\r\nSwartboy it was; and, though several years have rolled over the\r\nBushman's bare head since we saw him last, there is no visible change\r\nobservable in Swartboy.  The thinly scattered \"kinks\" of browny black\r\nwool still adorn Swartboy's crown and occiput, but they are no thinner--\r\nthe same good-natured grin is observed upon his yellow face--he is still\r\nthe same faithful servant--the same expert driver--the same useful\r\nfellow that he ever was.  Swartboy, of course, drives the wagon of the\r\nVon Blooms.\r\n\r\nNow the driver of the Van Wyk vehicle is about as unlike Swartboy as a\r\nbear to a bluebottle.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he is above a third taller than the Bushman,\r\nstanding over six feet,--not in his stockings, for he never wears\r\nstockings, but in sandals, which he does wear.\r\n\r\nHis complexion is darker than that of the Hottentot, although it is not\r\nblack, but rather of a bronze colour; and the hair of his head, although\r\nsomewhat \"woolly,\" is longer than Swartboy's, and less inclined to _take\r\nroot at both ends_!  Where the line of Swartboy's nose is concave, that\r\nof the other is convex, and the nose itself almost aquiline.  A dark\r\npiercing eye, a row of white teeth regularly set, lips of moderate\r\nthickness, a well-proportioned form, and erect attitude, give to this\r\nindividual, an aspect of grandeur and gravity, both of which are in\r\ncomplete contrast with the comic picture presented by the short stout\r\nbody and grinning countenance of the Bushman.\r\n\r\nThe costume of the tall man has something graceful about it.  It\r\nconsists of a tunic-like skirt suspended around the waist and hanging\r\ndown to mid-thigh.  There is something peculiar in this skirt.  It has\r\nthe appearance of a fringe or drapery of long white hairs, not plaited\r\nor woven, but hanging free and full.  It is, in fact, the true costume\r\nof a savage; and consists simply of a number of antelope's tails--the\r\nwhite tails of the gnoo--strung together around the waist, and allowed\r\nto fall to their full length down the thighs.  A sort of \"tippet\" of the\r\nsame surrounding the shoulders, with copper rings on the ankles and\r\narmlets encircling the wrist, a bunch of ostrich-feathers waving from\r\nhis crown, and a string of beads around his neck, complete the costume\r\nof Congo the Kaffir--for to that nation of romantic savages belonged the\r\nwagon-driver of the Van Wyks.\r\n\r\nWhat! a Kaffir the driver of a wagon? you will exclaim.  You can hardly\r\nrealise the idea, that a Kaffir--a warrior, as you may deem him--could\r\nbe employed in so menial an office as wagon-driving!  But it is even so.\r\nMany Kaffirs are so engaged in the Cape Colony,--indeed, many\r\nthousands; and in offices of a more degrading kind than driving a wagon\r\nteam--which by the way, is far from being considered an unworthy\r\nemployment in South Africa, so far that the sons of the wealthiest boors\r\nmay often be seen mounted upon the voor-kist and handling the long\r\nbamboo whip with all the ability of a practised \"jarvey.\"  There is\r\nnothing odd about Congo the Kaffir being wagon-driver to the Van Wyks.\r\nHe was a refugee, who had escaped from the despotic rule of the\r\nblood-stained monster Chaaka.  Having in some way offended the tyrant,\r\nhe had been compelled to flee for his life; and, after wandering\r\nsouthward, had found safety and protection among the colonists.  Here he\r\nhad learnt to make himself a useful member of civilised society, though\r\na lingering regard for ancient habits influenced him still to retain the\r\ncostume of his native country--the country of the Zooloo Kaffir.\r\n\r\nNo one could have blamed him for this; for, as he stood with his ample\r\nleopard-skin _kaross_ suspended togalike from his shoulders, the silvery\r\nskirt draping gracefully to his knees, and his metal rings glittering\r\nunder the blaze of the camp-fire, a noble picture he presented,--a\r\nsavage but interesting picture.  No one could blame Congo for wishing to\r\ndisplay his fine form in so becoming a costume.\r\n\r\nAnd no one did.  No one was jealous of the handsome savage.\r\n\r\nYes,--one.  There was one who did not regard him with the most amiable\r\nfeelings.  There was a rival who could not listen to Congo's praise with\r\nindifference.  One who liked not Congo.  That rival was Swartboy.  Talk\r\nof the rivalry that existed between the hunters Hendrik and Groot\r\nWillem, of that between Klaas and Jan.  Put both into one, and it would\r\nstill fall far short of the constant struggles for pre-eminence that\r\nwere exhibited between the rival \"whips,\" Swartboy the Bushman, and\r\nCongo the Kaffir.\r\n\r\nSwartboy and Congo were the only servants with the expedition.  Cooks or\r\nother attendants the young yagers had none.  Not but that the rich\r\nlanddrost,--for it must be remembered that Von Bloom was now chief\r\nmagistrate of his district,--and the wealthy boor could have easily\r\nafforded a score of attendants upon each trio of hunters.  But there\r\nwere no attendants whatever beyond the two drivers.  This was not on the\r\nscore of economy.  No such thing.  It was simply because the old\r\nsoldiers, Hendrik Von Bloom and Diedrik Van Wyk, were not the men to\r\npamper their boys with too much luxury.\r\n\r\n\"If they must go a-hunting, let them rough it,\" said they; and so they\r\nstarted them off, giving them a brace of wagons to carry their\r\n_impedimenta_--and their spoils.\r\n\r\nBut the young yagers needed no attendance.  Each knew how to wait upon\r\nhimself.  Even the youngest could skin an antelope and broil its ribs\r\nover the fire; and that was about all the cookery they would require\r\ntill their return.  The healthy stomach of the hunter supplies a sauce\r\nmore appetising than either Harvey or Soyer could concoct with all their\r\nculinary skill.\r\n\r\nBefore arriving at their present camp the young yagers had been out\r\nseveral weeks; but, although they had hunted widely, they had not fallen\r\nin with any of the great game, such as giraffes, buffaloes, or\r\nelephants; and scarce an adventure worth talking about.  A day or two\r\nbefore a grand discussion had taken place as to whether they should\r\ncross the great river, and proceed farther northward, in search of the\r\ncamelopard and elephant, or whether they should continue on the southern\r\nside, jaging springboks, hartebeests, and several other kinds of\r\nantelopes.  This discussion ended in a resolve to continue on to the\r\nnorth, and remain there till their time was up,--the time of course\r\nbeing regulated by the duration of college and school vacations, and\r\nleave of absence from the \"Corps.\"\r\n\r\nGroot Willem had been the principal adviser of this course, and Hans his\r\nbacker.  The former was desirous of jaging the elephant, the buffalo,\r\nand giraffe,--a sport at which he was still but a novice, as he had\r\nnever had a fair opportunity of hunting these mighty giants of the wood;\r\nwhile Hans was equally desirous of an exploring expedition that would\r\nbring him in contact with new forms of vegetable life.\r\n\r\nStrange as it may appear, Arend threw in his vote for returning home;\r\nand, stranger still, that the hunter Hendrik should join him in this\r\nadvice!\r\n\r\nBut almost every thing can be explained, if we examine it with care and\r\npatience; and the odd conduct of the two \"cornets\" was capable of\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nHans slyly hinted that it was possible that a certain brunette,\r\nWilhelmina, might have something to do with Hendrik's decision; but\r\nGroot Willem, who was a rough plain-spoken fellow, broadly alleged, that\r\nit was nothing else than Truey that was carrying Arend's thoughts\r\nhomeward; and the consequence of these hints and assertions was, that\r\nneither Hendrik nor Arend offered any further opposition to going\r\nnorthward among the elephants, but, blushing red to the very eyes, both\r\nwere only too glad to give in their assent and terminate the discussion.\r\n\r\nNorthward then became the word:--northward for the land of the tall\r\ngiraffe and the mighty elephant!\r\n\r\nThe young yagers had arrived on the southern bank of the Orange River,\r\nopposite to a well-known \"drift,\" or crossing-place.  There chanced to\r\nbe a freshet in the river; and they had encamped, and were waiting until\r\nthe water should fall and the ford become passable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THREE.\r\n\r\nHOW CONGO CROSSED A \"DRIFT.\"\r\n\r\nNext morning, by break of day, our yagers were astir, and the first\r\nobject upon which they rested their eyes was the river.  To their joy it\r\nhad fallen several feet, as they could tell by the water-mark upon the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nThe streams of South Africa, like those of most tropical and\r\nsub-tropical countries, and especially where the district is\r\nmountainous, rise and fall with much greater rapidity than those of\r\ntemperate climes.  Their sudden rise is accounted for by the great\r\nquantity of water which in tropical storms is precipitated within a\r\nshort period of time--the rain falling, not in light sparse drops, but\r\nthick and heavy, for several hours together, until the whole surface of\r\nthe country is saturated, and every rivulet becomes a torrent.\r\n\r\nOf these storms we have an exemplification in our summer\r\nthunder-showers--with their big rain-drops, when in a few minutes the\r\ngutter becomes a rivulet and the rut of the cartwheel a running stream.\r\nFortunately these \"sunshiny\" showers are of short duration.  They \"last\r\nonly half-an-hour,\" instead of many hours.  Fancy one of them continuing\r\nfor a whole day or a week!  If such were to be the case, we should\r\nwitness floods as sudden and terrible as those of the tropics.\r\n\r\nThe quick fall in the streams of South Africa is easily accounted for--\r\nthe principal reason being that the clouds are their feeders, and not,\r\nas with us, springs and lakes.  Tropic rivers rarely run from\r\nreservoirs; the abrupt cessation of the rain cuts off their supply, and\r\nthe consequence is the sudden falling of their waters.  Evaporation by a\r\nhot sun, and large absorption by the dry earth, combine to produce this\r\neffect.  Now the young yagers saw that the \"Gareep\" (such is the native\r\nname of the Orange River) had fallen many feet during the night; but\r\nthey knew not whether it was yet fordable.  Though the place was a\r\n\"drift\" used by Hottentots, Bechuanas, traders, and occasionally\r\n\"trek-boors,\" yet none of the party knew any thing of its depth, now\r\nthat the freshet was on.  There were no marks to indicate the depth--no\r\nmeans by which they could ascertain it.  They could not see the bottom,\r\nas the water was of a yellow-brown colour, in consequence of the flood.\r\nIt might be three feet--it might be six--but as the current was very\r\nrapid, it would be a dangerous experiment to wade in and measure its\r\ndepth in that way.\r\n\r\nWhat were they to do then?  They were impatient to effect a crossing.\r\nHow were they to do so in safety?\r\n\r\nHendrik proposed that one of them should try the ford on horseback.  If\r\nthey could not wade it, they might swim over.  He offered to go himself.\r\nGroot Willem, not to be outdone by Hendrik in daring, made a similar\r\nproposal.  But Hans, who was the eldest of the party, and whose prudent\r\ncounsels were usually regarded by all, gave his advice against this\r\ncourse.  The experiment would be too perilous, he said.  Should the\r\nwater prove too deep, the horses would be compelled to swim, and with so\r\nrapid a current they might be carried far below the \"drift,\"--perhaps\r\ndown to where the banks were high and steep.  There they should not be\r\nable to climb out, and both horse and rider might perish.\r\n\r\nBesides, urged Hans, even should a rider succeed by swimming to reach\r\nthe opposite side in safety, the oxen and wagons could not get over in\r\nthat way, and where would be the use of crossing without _them_?  None\r\nwhatever.  Better, therefore, to wait a little longer until they should\r\nbe certain that the river had subsided to its usual level.  That they\r\ncould ascertain by the water ceasing to fall any further, and another\r\nday would decide the point.  It would only be the loss of another day.\r\n\r\nHans's reasoning was good, and so was his counsel.  Hendrik and Groot\r\nWillem acknowledged this, and agreed to act upon it; but for all that,\r\nGroot Willem, who was longing to get among the giraffes, buffaloes, and\r\nelephants, felt a strong desire to attempt the crossing; and Hendrik,\r\ntoo, was similarly inclined, from the sheer love of adventure--for\r\nHendrik's fault was that of being over-courageous.\r\n\r\nBoth would have risked the river--even to swimming it--had it been\r\npracticable for the teams to have crossed, but as that was not believed\r\npossible, they agreed, though with rather a bad grace, to wait upon the\r\nwater another day.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, they were not to wait a day,--scarcely an hour.  In an\r\nhour from that time they had crossed the drift--wagons, oxen, and all--\r\nand were trekking over the plain on the opposite side!\r\n\r\nWhat had led to their so suddenly changing their resolution?  How had\r\nthey ascertained that the drift was fordable?  For a knowledge of that\r\nfact they were indebted to Congo the Kaffir.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in their discussion as to the depth of the river, the\r\nlatter had been observed standing upon the bank and throwing large\r\npebbles into the stream.  Thinking it was merely some freak or\r\nsuperstition on the part of the savage, none of them had taken any\r\nnotice of him, Swartboy excepted.  The Bushman was watching the Kaffir,\r\nwith glances that bespoke a keen interest in his movements.\r\n\r\nAt length a loud scornful laugh, from Swartboy, accompanying a series of\r\nrather rough phrases, directed the attention of the young yagers upon\r\nthe Kaffir.\r\n\r\n\"My footy, Congo! ole fool you! b'lieve you tell depth so? tink so, ole\r\nskellum?  Ha! ha! ha! you bania groot ole humbug!  Ha! ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\nThe Kaffir took no notice of this rather insulting apostrophe, but\r\ncontinued to fling his pebbles as before; but the young yagers, who were\r\nalso watching him, noticed that he was not throwing them carelessly, but\r\nin a peculiar manner, and their attention now became fixed upon him.\r\n\r\nThey saw that each time as the pebble parted from his fingers, he bent\r\nsuddenly forward, with his ear close to the surface, and in this\r\nattitude appeared to listen to the \"plunge\" of the stone!  When the\r\nsound died away, he would rise erect again, fling another pebble\r\n_farther out than the last_, and then crouch and listen as before?\r\n\r\n\"What's the Kaffir about?\" asked Hendrik of Groot Willem and Arend, who,\r\nbeing his masters, were more likely to know.\r\n\r\nNeither could tell.  Some Zooloo trick, no doubt; Congo knew many a one.\r\nBut what he meant by his present demonstration neither could tell.\r\nSwartboy's conjecture appeared to be correct, the Kaffir was _sounding\r\nthe depth of the drift_.\r\n\r\n\"Hilloa, there!  Congo!\" cried Groot Willem.  \"What are ye after, old\r\nboy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Congo find how deep drift be, baas Willem,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you can't tell that way; can you?\"\r\n\r\nThe Kaffir made answer in the affirmative.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" ejaculated Swartboy, jealous of the interest his rival was\r\nbeginning to excite; \"da's all nonsense; ole fool know noffin 't all\r\n'bout it,--dat he don't.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kaffir still took no notice of Swartboy's gibes--though they no\r\ndoubt nettled him a little--but kept on casting the pebbles, each one,\r\nas already stated, being flung so as to fall several feet beyond the one\r\nthat preceded it.  He continued at this, until the last pebble was seen\r\nto plunge within a yard or two of the opposite side of the current, here\r\nmore than a hundred yards wide.  Then raising himself erect, and turning\r\nhis face to the young yagers, he said in firm but respectful tones--\r\n\r\n\"Mynheeren, you drift may cross--now.\"\r\n\r\nAll regarded him with incredulous glances.\r\n\r\n\"How deep think you it is?\" inquired Hans.  The Kaffir made answer by\r\nplacing his hands upon his hips.  It would reach so high.\r\n\r\n\"My footy!\" exclaimed Swartboy, in derision.  \"It's twice dar depth.  Do\r\nyou want drown us, ole fool?\"\r\n\r\n\"May drown _you_--nobody else!\" quietly replied the Kaffir, at the same\r\ntime measuring Swartboy with his eye, and curling his lip in derision of\r\nthe Bushman's short stature.\r\n\r\nThe young yagers burst out into a loud laugh.  Swartboy felt the sting,\r\nbut for some moments was unable to retort.\r\n\r\nAt length he found words--\r\n\r\n\"All talk, you ole black, all talk!  You make groot show,--you berry\r\nwise,--you want wagon sweep off,--you want drown da poor oxen,--you\r\npretend so deep.  If tink so, go wade da drift,--go wade yourself!  Ha!\"\r\n\r\nSwartboy thought by this challenge he had put the finisher on the\r\nKaffir.  He believed that the latter would not dare to try the ford, in\r\nspite of his assertion about its depth.  But Swartboy was doomed to\r\ndisappointment and humiliation.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he uttered the sneering challenge when the Kaffir, having\r\nbent a glance upon the rest, and seeing, that they regarded him with\r\nlooks of expectation, turned round and dashed down the bank to the edge\r\nof the water.\r\n\r\nAll saw that he was bent upon crossing.  Several of them uttered cries\r\nof warning, and cautioned him to desist.\r\n\r\nBut the Zooloo spirit was roused, and the savage did not heed the\r\nwarning cries.  He did not hurry madly into the current, however; but\r\nset about the business with caution and design.  They saw him stoop down\r\nby the edge of the water, and the next moment rise erect again, holding\r\nin his hands a large stone that could not have weighed much less than a\r\nhundredweight.  This, to the astonishment of all, he raised upon the\r\ncrown of his head, and, holding it in that position, marched boldly into\r\nthe water!\r\n\r\nAll saw the object of his carrying the stone,--which was, of course, to\r\nenable him by its additional weight to stem the strong current!  In this\r\nhe was quite successful, for although the water at certain places rose\r\nquite to his waist, in less than five minutes he stood high and dry on\r\nthe opposite bank.\r\n\r\nA cheer greeted him, in which all but Swartboy joined, and another\r\nreceived him on his return; and then the oxen were inspanned, and the\r\nhorses saddled and mounted, and wagons, oxen, dogs, horses, and yagers,\r\nall crossed safely over, and continued their route northward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOUR.\r\n\r\nA BRACE OF \"BLACK MANES.\"\r\n\r\nIf the young yagers had met with but few adventures south of the Gareep,\r\nthey were not long north of it before they fell in with one of\r\nsufficient interest to be chronicled.  It occurred at their very first\r\ncamp after crossing.\r\n\r\nThey had chosen for their camp the side of a \"vley,\" in the midst of a\r\nwide plain, where there chanced to be both grass and water, though both\r\nof a rather indifferent kind.  The plain was tolerably open, though here\r\nand there grew clumps of low bushes, and between these stood at\r\nintervals the dome-shaped houses of white ants--those of the _Termes\r\nmordax_--rising to the height of several feet above the surface.\r\n\r\nThey had just outspanned and permitted their oxen to wander upon the\r\ngrass, when the voice of Swartboy was heard exclaiming--\r\n\r\n\"De leuw! de leuw!\"\r\n\r\nAll looked where Swartboy pointed.  There, sure enough, was a lion,--a\r\nlarge \"schwart-fore-life,\" or _black-maned_ one,--right out upon the\r\nplain, and beyond the place where the oxen were browsing.\r\n\r\nThere was a clump of \"bosch\" just behind the lion.  Out of this he had\r\ncome at sight of the oxen; and, having advanced a few yards, he had lain\r\ndown among the grass, and was now watching the animals as a cat would a\r\nmouse, or a spider the unconscious fly.\r\n\r\nThey had scarcely set their eyes upon him when another was seen issuing\r\nfrom the \"bosch,\" and, with stealthy trot, running up to the side of her\r\ncompanion.  _Her_ companion, I say, because the second was a lioness, as\r\nthe absence of a mane and the tiger-like form testified.  She was\r\nscarcely inferior in size to the lion, and not a bit less fierce and\r\ndangerous in any encounter she might chance to fall in with.\r\n\r\nHaving joined the lion, she squatted beside him; and both now sat upon\r\ntheir tails, like two gigantic cats, with full front towards the camp,\r\nand evidently eyeing the oxen with hungry looks.\r\n\r\nHorses, hunters, drivers, and dogs, were all in sight; but what cared\r\nthe lions for that?  The tempting prey was before them, and they\r\nevidently meditated an attack,--if not just then, whenever the\r\nopportunity offered.  Most certainly they contemplated supping either\r\nupon ox-beef or horse-flesh.\r\n\r\nNow these were the first lions that had been encountered upon the\r\nexpedition.  \"Spoor\" had been seen several times, and the terrible roar\r\nhad been heard once or twice around the night-camp; but the \"king of\r\nbeasts\" now appeared for the first time _in propria persona_, with his\r\nqueen along with him, and of course his presence was productive of no\r\nsmall excitement in the yager camp.  It must not be denied that this\r\nexcitement partook largely of the nature of a \"panic.\"\r\n\r\nThe first fear of the hunters was for their own skins, and in this both\r\nBushman and Kaffir equally shared.  After a time, however, this feeling\r\nsubsided.  The lions would not attack the camp.  They do so only on very\r\nrare occasions.  It was the camp _animals_ they were after, and so long\r\nas these were present, they would not spring upon their owners.  So far\r\nthere was no danger, and our yagers recovered their self-possession.\r\n\r\nBut it would not do to let the carnivorous brutes destroy their oxen,--\r\nthat would not do.  Something must be done to secure them.  A kraal must\r\nbe made at once, and the animals driven into it.  The lions lay quietly\r\non the plain, though still in a menacing attitude.  But they were a good\r\nway off--full five hundred yards--and were not likely to attack the oxen\r\nso close to the camp.  The huge wagons--strange sight to them--no doubt\r\nhad the effect of restraining them for the present.  They either waited\r\nuntil the oxen should browse nearer, or till night would enable them to\r\napproach the latter unobserved.\r\n\r\nAs soon, then, as it was perceived that they were not bent upon an\r\nimmediate attack, Groot Willem and Hendrik mounted their horses, rode\r\ncautiously out beyond the oxen, and quietly drove the latter to the\r\nother side of the vley.  There they were herded by Klaas and Jan; while\r\nall the rest, Swartboy and Congo included, went to work with axe and\r\nbill-hook in the nearest thicket of \"wait-a-bit\" thorns.  In less than\r\nhalf-an-hour a sufficient number of bushes were cut to form, with the\r\nhelp of the wagons, a strong kraal; and inside this, both horses and\r\noxen were driven,--the former made fast to the wheel-spokes, while the\r\nlatter were clumped up loosely within the enclosure.\r\n\r\nThe hunters now felt secure.  They had kindled a large fire on each side\r\nof the kraal, though they knew that this will not always keep lions off.\r\nBut they trusted to their guns; and as they would sleep inside the\r\ncanvass tents of their wagons, closing both \"voor\" and \"achter-claps,\"\r\nthey had nothing to fear.  It would be a hungry lion, indeed, that would\r\nhave attempted to break the strong kraal they had made; and no lion,\r\nhowever hungry, would ever think of charging into a wagon.\r\n\r\nHaving made all secure, therefore, they seated themselves around one of\r\ntheir fires, and set about cooking their dinner, or rather\r\ndinner-supper, for it was to include both meals.  Their journey\r\nprevented them from dining earlier.\r\n\r\nThey chanced to have little else than _biltong_, or dried meat, to cook.\r\nThe long wait by the drift had consumed their stock of fine springbok\r\nvenison, which they had laid in some days before.  It is true they had\r\nvenison in camp, but it was that of the \"reitbok,\" or reed-buck--so\r\ncalled from its habit of frequenting the long reeds by the banks of\r\nrivers; and it was while they were journeying through a belt of these\r\nafter crossing the drift, that this one had been shot by Hendrik.  A\r\nsmall antelope the reitbok is--the _Antilope eleotragus_ of naturalists.\r\nIt stands less than three feet in height, formed much like the\r\nspringbok, but with a rougher coat of hair, of an ashy grey colour, and\r\nsilver white underneath.  Its horns, however, are not lyrate, as in the\r\nspringbok, but rise first in the plane of its forehead, and then curve\r\nboldly forward to the tips.  They are about twelve inches in length,\r\nwrinkled at the base, prominently ringed in the middle, and smooth near\r\nthe points.  The reitbok, as its name implies, inhabits the reedy\r\nbottoms by the margins of streams and rivers, and its food consists of\r\nplants growing in humid and marshy situations.  Hence its flesh is\r\ninferior to that of most South African antelopes, and it was not a\r\nfavourite with the young yagers.  Although it had been brought along,\r\nthey preferred even the dry biltong, and it was left to the less\r\ndelicate appetites of Swartboy and Congo.\r\n\r\nNow the hunters, Hendrik and Groot Willem, would have gone out to look\r\nfor a springbok, or some other game, but the presence of the lions\r\nprevented that; and so the boys were obliged to content themselves with\r\na slice of the biltong; and each, having cut him a short stick for a\r\nspit, set about broiling his piece over the coals.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the lion and lioness kept the position they had\r\ntaken on the plain, scarce once having changed their attitude.  They\r\nwere waiting patiently the approach of night.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem and Hendrik had both advised making an attack upon them;\r\nbut in this case they again gave way to the more prudent counsel of\r\nHans, strengthened, perhaps, by his reminding them of the instructions\r\nthey had received from both their fathers at setting out.  These\r\ninstructions were,--never to attack a lion without good reason for so\r\ndoing, but always to give the \"ole leuw\" a wide berth when it was\r\npossible to do so.  It is well known that the lion will rarely attack\r\nman when not first assailed; and therefore the advice given to the young\r\nyagers was sound and prudent? and they followed it.\r\n\r\nIt wanted yet an hour or two of sunset.  The lions still sat squatted on\r\nthe grass, closely observed by the hunters.\r\n\r\nAll at once the eyes of the latter became directed upon a new object.\r\nSlowly approaching over the distant plain, appeared two strange animals,\r\nsimilar in form, and nearly so in size and colour.  Each was about the\r\nsize of an ass, and not unlike one in colour,--especially that variety\r\nof the ass which is of a buff or fulvous tint.  Their forms, however,\r\nwere more graceful than that of the ass, though they were far from being\r\nlight or slender.  On the contrary, they were of a full, round, bold\r\noutline.  They were singularly marked about the head and face.  The\r\nground colour of these parts was white, but four dark bands were so\r\ndisposed over them as to give the animals the appearance of wearing a\r\nheadstall of black leather.  The first of these bands descended in a\r\nstreak down the forehead; another passed through the eyes to the corners\r\nof the mouth; a third embraced the nose; while a fourth ran from the\r\nbase of the ears passing under the throat--a regular throat-strap--thus\r\ncompleting the resemblance to the stall-halter.\r\n\r\nA reversed mane, a dark list down the back, and a long black bushy tail\r\nreaching to the ground, were also characters to be observed.  But what\r\nrendered these animals easily to be distinguished from all others was\r\nthe splendid pair of horns which each carried.  These horns were\r\nstraight, slender, pointing backwards almost horizontally.  They were\r\nregularly ringed till within a few inches of their tips, which were as\r\nsharp as steel spits.  In both they were of a deep jet colour, shining\r\nlike ebony, and full three feet in length.  But what was rather\r\nsingular, the horns of the smaller animal--for there was some difference\r\nin their size--were longer than those of the larger one!  The former was\r\nthe female, the latter the male, therefore the horns of the female were\r\nmore developed than those of the male--an anomaly among animals of the\r\nantelope tribe, for antelopes they were.  The young yagers had no\r\ndifficulty in distinguishing their kind.  At the first glance they all\r\nrecognised the beautiful \"oryx,\" one of the loveliest animals of Africa,\r\none of the fairest creatures in the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIVE.\r\n\r\nLIONS STALKING THE GEMSBOK.\r\n\r\nOn seeing the \"gemsbok\"--for by such name is the oryx known to the Cape\r\ncolonists--the first thought of the young yagers was how they should\r\nkill or capture one of them.  Beautiful as these creatures looked upon\r\nthe plain, our hunters would have fancied them better on the spit--for\r\nthey well knew that the venison of the gemsbok is delicious eating--not\r\nsurpassed by that of any other antelope, the eland perhaps excepted.\r\n\r\nThe first thought of the yagers, then, was a steak of gemsbok venison\r\nfor dinner.  It might throw their dinner a little later, but it would be\r\nso much of a better one than dry biltong, that they were willing to\r\nwait.\r\n\r\nThe slices of jerked meat, already half-broiled, were at once put aside,\r\nand guns were grasped in the place of roasting-sticks.\r\n\r\nWhat was the best course to be pursued?  That was the next question.\r\n\r\nIt would scarce be possible to stalk the gemsboks.  They are among the\r\nmost wary of antelopes.  They rarely approach near any cover that might\r\nshelter an enemy; and when alarmed they strike off in a straight line,\r\nand make for the open desert plains--their natural home.  To stalk them,\r\nis a most difficult thing, and rarely attempted by the hunter.  They can\r\nonly be captured by a swift horse, and after a severe chase.  Even from\r\nthe swiftest horse they often make their escape; for in the first burst\r\nof a mile or two they can run like the wind.  A good horse, however, has\r\nmore \"bottom\" than they, and if well managed will in time overtake them.\r\n\r\nThe hunters having seized their guns, next thought of their horses.\r\nShould they saddle and ride out after the gemsboks?  That would have\r\nbeen their course at once, and without further consideration, had they\r\nnot observed that the antelopes were coming directly towards them.  If\r\nthey continued in the same course much longer, they, the yagers, need\r\nnot stir from the spot.  The game would approach within shot and save\r\nthem the trouble of a chase.  This would be very agreeable, as the\r\nhunters were hungry, and their horses tired after a hard day's\r\njourneying.\r\n\r\nThere was some probability that the gemsboks would give them the chance\r\nthey wished for.  The camp was well hidden among the bushes.  The smoke\r\nof the fire alone showed its situation, but the antelopes might not\r\nperceive this, or if so, might not regard it as a thing to be feared.\r\nBesides, as Groot Willem and Hendrik observed, the vley was close by,\r\nand both believed the antelopes were on their way to the water.  The\r\nstudent Hans, however, corrected them in this belief, by telling them\r\nthat the oryx is an animal _that never drinks_,--that it is quite\r\nindependent of springs, streams, or vleys,--one of those creatures which\r\nNature has formed to dwell in the desert, where no water exists!  It was\r\nnot likely then that the gemsboks were coming to the vley.  The hunters\r\nneed make no calculation on that.\r\n\r\nAt all events, they were certainly approaching the camp.  They were\r\nheading straight for it, and were already less than a thousand yards\r\nfrom the spot.  There would scare be time to saddle before they should\r\ncome within shot, or else start off alarmed at the appearance of the\r\nsmoke.  The hunters, therefore, gave up all thoughts of a chase; and,\r\ncrouching forward to the outer edge of the grove, they knelt down behind\r\nthe bushes to await the approach of the antelopes.\r\n\r\nThe latter still kept steadily on, apparently unconscious of danger.\r\nSurely they had not yet perceived the smoke, else they would have shown\r\nsymptoms either of curiosity or alarm!  The wind was blowing in the same\r\ndirection in which they marched, or their keen sense of smell would have\r\nwarned them of the dangerous proximity of the hunter's camp.  But it did\r\nnot; and they continued with slow but unaltered pace to approach the\r\nspot, where no less than six dark muzzles--a full battery of small\r\narms--were waiting to give them a volley.\r\n\r\nIt was not the destiny of either of the gemsboks to die by a leaden\r\nbullet.  Death, sudden and violent awaited them, though not from the\r\nhand of man.  It was to come from a different quarter.\r\n\r\nAs the yagers lay watching the approach of the antelopes, their eyes had\r\nwandered for a moment from the lions; but a movement on the part of\r\nthese again drew attention to them.  Up to a certain period they had\r\nremained in an upright attitude, squatted upon their tails, but all at\r\nonce they were observed to crouch flat down, as if to conceal themselves\r\nunder the grass, while their heads were turned in a new direction.  They\r\nwere turned towards the gemsboks.  They had caught sight of the latter\r\nas they approached over the plain; and it was evident that they\r\ncontemplated an attack upon them.\r\n\r\nNow if the antelopes continued on in the same course, it would carry\r\nthem quite clear of the lions, so that the latter would have no\r\nadvantage.  A gemsbok can soon scour off from a lion, as the latter is\r\nat best but a poor runner, and secures his prey by a sudden spring or\r\ntwo, or else not at all.  Unless, therefore, the lions could obtain the\r\nadvantage of getting within bounding distance of the antelopes without\r\nbeing seen by them, their chances of making a capture would be poor\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThey knew this, and to effect that purpose--that of getting near--now\r\nappeared to be their design.  The lion was observed to crawl off from\r\nthe spot in a direction that would enable him to get upon the path of\r\nthe gemsboks, between them and the camp.  By a series of manoeuvres,--\r\nnow crawling flat along the grass, like a cat after a partridge; now\r\npausing behind a bush or an ant-heap to survey the game; then trotting\r\nlightly on to the next,--he at length reached a large ant-hill that\r\nstood right by the path in which the antelopes were advancing.  He\r\nseemed to be satisfied of this, for he stopped here and placed himself\r\nclose in to the base of the hill, so that only a small portion of his\r\nhead projected on the side towards the game.  His whole body, however,\r\nand every movement he made, were visible to the hunters from _their_\r\nambush in the grove.\r\n\r\nBut where was the lioness?  She was no longer by the _bosch_ where first\r\nseen.  Where had she gone?  Not with the lion?  No.  On the contrary,\r\nshe had gone in a direction nearly opposite to that taken by him.  Their\r\neyes had been busy with his movements, and they had not noticed hers.\r\nNow, however, that the lion had come to a halt, they looked abroad for\r\nhis mate, and saw her far out upon the plain.  They saw that she was\r\nprogressing in the same way the lion had done,--now crawling among the\r\ngrass, now trotting swiftly from bush to bush, and pausing a moment\r\nbehind each, but evidently bending her course so as to arrive _in the\r\nrear_ of the antelopes!\r\n\r\nThe \"strategy\" of the lions was now perceived.  They had evidently\r\nplanned it before separating.  The lion was to place himself in ambush\r\nupon the path, while the lioness swept round to the rear and forced the\r\nantelopes forward; or should the latter become alarmed and retreat, the\r\nlion could then show himself in pursuit, and run the frightened game\r\nback into the clutches of the lioness.\r\n\r\nThe thing was well calculated, and although it was likely to rob the\r\nhunters of their game, they had grown so interested in the movements of\r\nthe carnivora and their intended victims, that they thought only of\r\nwatching the spectacle to its end.\r\n\r\nThe ambuscade was well planned, and in a few minutes its success was no\r\nlonger doubtful.  The gemsboks advanced steadily towards the ant-hill,\r\noccasionally switching about their black bushy tails; but that was to\r\nrid their flanks of the flies, and not from any apprehension of danger.\r\n\r\nThe lioness had completed the great _detour_ she had made, and was now\r\nseen crouching after them, though still far to the rear.\r\n\r\nAs the antelopes drew near the ant-hill, the lion was observed to draw\r\nback his head until it was nearly concealed under his black shaggy mane.\r\nThey could not possibly have seen him where he lay, nor he them, and he\r\nnow appeared to trust to his ears to inform him of their approach.\r\n\r\nHe waited till both were opposite, and broadside toward him, at the\r\ndistance of less than twenty paces from the hill.  Then his tail was\r\nseen to vibrate with one or two quick jerks, his head shot suddenly\r\nforth, his body spread out apparently to twice its natural size, and the\r\nnext moment he rose like a bird into the air!\r\n\r\nWith one bound he cleared the wide space that separated him from the\r\nnearest of the gemsboks, alighting on the hind-quarters of the terrified\r\nanimal.  A single blow of his powerful paw brought the antelope on its\r\nhaunches; and another, delivered almost at the same instant, stretched\r\nits body lifeless on the plain!\r\n\r\nWithout looking after the other, or seeming to care further about it,\r\nthe lion sprang upon the body of his victim, and, clutching its throat\r\nbetween his jaws, commenced drinking its warm blood.\r\n\r\nIt was the bull gemsbok which the lion had pulled down, as this was the\r\none that happened to be nearest the hill.\r\n\r\nAs the lion sprang upon her companion, the cow of course started with\r\naffright, and all supposed they would see her the next moment scouring\r\noff over the plains.  To their astonishment she did no such thing.  Such\r\nis not the nature of the noble oryx.  On the contrary, as soon as she\r\nrecovered from the first moments of alarm, she wheeled round towards the\r\nenemy; and, lowering her head to the very ground, so that her long horns\r\nprojected horizontally in front, she rushed with all her strength upon\r\nthe lion!  The latter, in full enjoyment of his red draught, saw nothing\r\nof this manoeuvre.  The first intimation he had of it was to feel a pair\r\nof spears pierced right through his ribs, and it is not likely he felt\r\nmuch more.\r\n\r\nFor some moments a confused struggling was observed, in which both lion\r\nand oryx seemed to take part; but the attitudes of both appeared so odd,\r\nand changed so rapidly, that the spectators could not tell in what\r\nmanner they were combating.  The roar of the lion however had ceased,\r\nand was now succeeded by the more shrill tones of the lioness, who,\r\nbounding forward upon the spot, mixed at once in the melee.\r\n\r\nA single touch of her claws brought the cow oryx to the earth, and ended\r\nthe strife; and the lioness now stood over the victims screaming her\r\nnote of triumph.\r\n\r\nWas it a note of triumph?  There was something odd in its tone--\r\nsomething singular in the movements of the creature that uttered it--\r\nsomething strange about the whole thing.  Why was the lion silent?  His\r\nroar had ceased, and he lay embracing the carcass of the bull gemsbok,\r\nand apparently drinking its blood.  Yet he was perfectly without motion,\r\nnot a muscle could be seen to move, not a quiver of his tawny hide\r\nbetokened that he breathed or lived!  Was he dead?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIX.\r\n\r\nAN ANGRY LIONESS.\r\n\r\nCertainly there was something mysterious about the matter.  The lion\r\nstill kept his position; no motion could be observed, no sound escaped\r\nhim; whereas the lioness uttered incessantly her shrill growling, at the\r\nsame time pacing to and fro, round and round, the confused heap of\r\nbodies!  She made no attempt to feed, though her prey lay bleeding\r\nbefore her.  Surely her lord was not the cause of her abstinence!  Did\r\nhe insist upon having both the carcasses to himself?\r\n\r\nSometimes it is so.  Sometimes an old male plays the selfish tyrant, and\r\nkeeps the younger and weaker members of his family off, till he has\r\ngorged himself, permitting them to make a \"second table\" of his\r\nleavings.\r\n\r\nIn the present instance this was not likely.  There were two whole\r\ncarcasses,--large fat carcasses,--enough for both.  Besides, the lioness\r\nwas evidently the lion's own mate--his wife.  It was scarcely probable\r\nhe would treat her so.  Among human beings instances of such\r\nselfishness,--such a gross want of gallantry, are, I regret to say, by\r\nno means rare; but the young yagers could not believe the lion guilty of\r\nsuch shabby conduct--the lion, Buffon's type of nobility!  No such\r\nthing.  But how was it?  The lioness still growled and paced about, ever\r\nand anon stooping near the head of her partner, which was not visible\r\nfrom the camp, and placing her snout in contact with his as if kissing\r\nhim.  Still there was no sign of any response, no motion on his part;\r\nand, after watching for a good while without perceiving any, the hunters\r\nat length became satisfied that the lion was dead.\r\n\r\nHe was dead--as Julius Caesar or a door-nail, and so, too, was the brace\r\nof gemsboks.  The lioness was the only living thing left from that\r\nsanguinary conflict!\r\n\r\nAs soon as the hunters became satisfied of this, they began to\r\ndeliberate among themselves what was best to be done.  They wished to\r\nget possession of the venison, but there was no hope of their being able\r\nto do so, as long as the lioness remained upon the ground.\r\n\r\nTo have attempted to drive her off at that moment would have been a most\r\nperilous undertaking.  She was evidently excited to madness, and would\r\nhave charged upon any creature that had shown itself in her\r\nneighbourhood.  The frenzied manner in which she paced about, and lashed\r\nher sides with her tail, her fierce and determined look, and deep angry\r\ngrowl, all told the furious rage she was in.  There was menace in her\r\nevery movement.  The hunters saw this, and prudently withdrew\r\nthemselves--so as to be near the wagons in case she might come that way.\r\n\r\nThey thought that by waiting awhile she would go off, and then they\r\ncould drag the antelopes up to camp.\r\n\r\nBut after waiting a good while, they observed no change in the conduct\r\nof the fierce brute.  She still paced around as before, and abstained\r\nfrom touching the carcasses.  As one of the yagers observed, she\r\ncontinued to \"play the dog in the manger,\"--would neither eat herself,\r\nnor suffer anybody else to eat.\r\n\r\nThis remark, which was made by little Jan, elicited a round of laughter\r\nthat sounded in strange contrast with the melancholy howl of the\r\nlioness, which still continued to terrify the animals of the camp.  Even\r\nthe dogs cowered among the wheels of the wagons, or kept close to the\r\nheels of their masters.  It is true that many of these faithful brutes,\r\nhad they been set on, would have manfully battled with the lioness, big\r\nas she was.  But the young yagers well knew that dogs before the paws of\r\nan angry lion are like mice under the claws of a cat.  They did not\r\nthink of setting them on, unless they had themselves made an attack; and\r\nthat, the advice of Hans, coupled with the counsels they had received\r\nbefore leaving home, prevented them from doing.  They had no intention\r\nof meddling with the lioness; and hoped she would soon retire, and leave\r\nthe game, or part of it, on the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting a long while, and seeing that the lioness showed no\r\nsymptoms of leaving the spot, they despaired of dining on oryx venison,\r\nand once more set to broiling their slices of biltong.\r\n\r\nThey had not yet commenced eating, when they perceived a new arrival\r\nupon the scene of the late struggle.  Half-a-dozen hyenas appeared upon\r\nthe ground; and although these had not yet touched the carcasses, but\r\nwere standing a little way off--through fear of the lioness--their\r\nhungry looks told plainly what their intention was in coming there.\r\n\r\nNow the presence of these hideous brutes was a new point for\r\nconsideration.  If the lioness should allow them to begin their feast\r\nupon the antelopes, in a very short while scarce a morsel of either\r\nwould remain.  The yagers, although they had resigned all hope of dining\r\non the gemsbok venison, nevertheless looked forward to making their\r\nsupper of it; but if the hyenas were permitted to step in, they would be\r\ndisappointed.\r\n\r\nHow were the brutes to be kept off?\r\n\r\nTo drive them off would be just as perilous an undertaking as to drive\r\noff the lioness herself.\r\n\r\nOnce more Groot Willem and Hendrik talked about attacking the latter;\r\nbut, as before, were opposed by Hans, who had to use all his influence\r\nwith his companions before he could induce them to abandon the rash\r\nproject.\r\n\r\nAt this moment an unexpected proposal put an end to their discussion.\r\n\r\nThe proposal came from Congo the Kaffir.  It was neither less nor more\r\nthan that he himself should go forth and do battle with the lioness!\r\n\r\n\"What! alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mad, Congo.  You would be torn to pieces!\"\r\n\r\n\"No fear, Mynheeren.  Congo the leuw kill without getting scratch.  You\r\nsee, young masters.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! without arms? without a gun?\"\r\n\r\n\"Congo not know how use one,\" replied the Kaffir, \"you see how I do\r\n'im,\" he continued.  \"All Congo ask you not come in way.  Young masters,\r\nhere stay and Congo leave to himself.  No danger.  Mynheeren, Congo fear\r\nif go yonder help him--leuw very mad.  Congo not care for that--so much\r\nmad, so much better--leuw no run away.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what do you intend to do, Congo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mynheeren soon all see--see how Congo kill lion.\"\r\n\r\nThe hunters were disposed to look upon the Kaffir as about to make a\r\nreckless exposure of his life.  Swartboy would have treated the proposal\r\nas a boast, and laughed thereat, but Swartboy remembered the humiliation\r\nhe had had in the morning on account of similar conduct; and though he\r\nfeared to be farther outstripped in hunter-craft by his rival, he had\r\nthe prudence upon this occasion to conceal his envy.  He bit his thick\r\nlips, and remained silent.  Some of the boys, and especially Hans, would\r\nhave dissuaded Congo from his purpose; but Groot Willem was inclined to\r\nlet him have his way.  Groot Willem knew the Kaffir better than any of\r\nthe others.  He knew, moreover, that savage as he was, he was not going\r\nto act any foolish part for the mere sake of braggadocio.  He could be\r\ntrusted.  So said Groot Willem.\r\n\r\nThis argument, combined with a desire to eat gemsbok venison for supper,\r\nhad its effect.  Arend and Hans gave in.\r\n\r\nCongo had full permission to battle with the lioness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVEN.\r\n\r\nHOW CONGO THE KAFFIR KILLED A LIONESS.\r\n\r\nCongo had now become an object of as great interest as in the morning.\r\nGreater in fact, for the new danger he was about to undergo--a combat\r\nwith an enraged lioness--was accounted still greater than that of\r\nfording the Gareep, and the interest was in proportion.  With eager eyes\r\nthe young yagers stood watching him as he prepared himself for the\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nHe was but a short while in getting ready.  He was seen to enter the Van\r\nWyk wagon, and in less than three minutes come out again fully armed and\r\nequipped.  The lioness would not have long to wait for her assailant.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of the Kaffir must needs be described.\r\n\r\nIt was simple enough, though odd to a stranger's eye.  It was neither\r\nmore nor less than the equipment of a Zooloo warrior.\r\n\r\nIn his right hand he held a bunch of _assegais_,--in all six of them.\r\n\r\nWhat is an \"assegai?\"\r\n\r\nIt is a straight lance or spear, though not to be used as one.  It is\r\nsmaller than either of these weapons, shorter and more slender in the\r\nshaft, but like them armed with an iron head of arrow shape.  In battle\r\nit is not retained in the hand, but flung at the enemy, often from a\r\nconsiderable distance.  It is, in short, a \"javelin,\" or \"dart,\"--such\r\nas was used in Europe before fire-arms became known, and such as at\r\npresent forms the war weapon of all the savage tribes of Southern\r\nAfrica, but especially those of the Kaffir nations.  And well know they\r\nhow to project this dangerous missile.  At the distance of a hundred\r\nyards they will send it with a force as great, and an aim as unerring,\r\nas either bullet or arrow!  The assegai is flung by a single arm.\r\n\r\nOf these javelins Congo carried six, spanning their slender shafts with\r\nhis long muscular fingers.\r\n\r\nThe assegais were not the oddest part of his equipment.  That was a\r\nremarkable thing which he bore on his left arm.  It was of oval form,\r\nfull six feet in length by about three in width, concave on the side\r\ntowards his body, and equally convex on the opposite.  More than any\r\nthing else did it resemble a small boat or canoe made of skins stretched\r\nover a framework of wood, and of such materials was it constructed.  It\r\nwas, in fact, a shield,--a Zooloo shield--though of somewhat larger\r\ndimensions than those used in war.  Notwithstanding its great size it\r\nwas far from clumsy, but light, tight, and firm,--so much so that arrow,\r\nassegai, or bullet, striking it upon the convex side, would have glanced\r\noff as from a plate of steel.\r\n\r\nA pair of strong bands fastened inside along the bottom enabled the\r\nwearer to move it about at will; and placed upright, with its lower end\r\nresting upon the ground, it would have sheltered the body of the tallest\r\nman.  It sheltered that of Congo, and Congo was no dwarf.\r\n\r\nWithout another word he walked out, the huge _carapace_ on his left arm,\r\nfive of the assegais clutched in his left hand, while one that he had\r\nchosen for the first throw he held in his right.  This one was grasped\r\nnear the middle, and carried upon the balance.\r\n\r\nNo change had taken place in the situation of affairs out upon the\r\nplain.  In fact, there had not been much time for any.  Scarce five\r\nminutes had elapsed from the time the Kaffir stated his purpose, until\r\nhe went forth to execute it.  The lioness was still roaming about,\r\nuttering her frightful screams.  The hyenas were still there.  The\r\nmoment the Kaffir was seen approaching, the cowardly hyenas fled with a\r\nhowl, and soon disappeared under the bosch.\r\n\r\nFar different with the lioness.  She seemed to pay no regard to the\r\napproach of the hunter.  She neither turned her head, nor looked in the\r\ndirection he was coming.  Her whole attention was absorbed by the mass\r\nof bodies upon the plain.  She yelled her savage notes as she regarded\r\nthem.  She was no doubt lamenting the fate of her grim and swarthy\r\npartner, that lay dead before her eyes.  At all events, she did not seem\r\nto notice the hunter, until he had got within twenty paces of the spot!\r\n\r\nAt that distance the Kaffir halted, rested his huge shield upon the\r\nground--still holding it erect--poised the assegai a moment in his right\r\nhand, and then sent it whizzing through the air.\r\n\r\nIt pierced the side of the tawny brute, and hung quivering between her\r\nribs.  Only for a moment.  The fierce animal doubled round upon herself,\r\ncaught the shaft in her teeth, and broke it off as if it had been a\r\nstraw!\r\n\r\nThe blade of the assegai still remained in the flesh, but the lioness\r\nwaited no longer.  She had now perceived her enemy; and, uttering a\r\nvengeful scream, she sprang towards him.  With one tremendous bound she\r\ncleared three-fourths of the space that lay between them, and a second\r\nwould have carried her upon the shoulders of the Kaffir; but the latter\r\nwas prepared to receive her, and, as she rose to her second leap, he\r\ndisappeared suddenly from the scene!  As if by magic he had vanished;\r\nand had not the boys been watching his every movement, they would have\r\nbeen at a loss to know what had become of him.  But they knew that under\r\nthat oval convex form, whose edges rested upon the earth, lay Congo the\r\nKaffir.  There lay he, like a tortoise in its shell, clutching the\r\nstraps with all his might, and pressing his carapace firmly against the\r\nground!\r\n\r\nThe lioness was more astonished than the spectators.  At the second leap\r\nshe pitched right down upon the shield, but the drum-like noise made by\r\nher weight, and the hard firm substance encountered by her claws, quite\r\ndisconcerted her, and springing aside she stood gazing at the odd object\r\nwith looks of alarm!\r\n\r\nShe stood but for a moment, and then, uttering a savage growl of\r\ndisappointment, turned tail upon it, and trotted off!\r\n\r\nThis growl guided Congo.  The shield was raised from the ground--only on\r\none side, and but a very little way at first--just enough to enable the\r\nhunter to see the stern of the retreating lioness.\r\n\r\nThen the Kaffir rose quickly to his feet, and, holding the shield erect,\r\nprepared for the casting of a second assegai.\r\n\r\nThis was quickly thrown and pierced the animal in the flank, where shaft\r\nand all remained sticking in the flesh.  The lioness turned with\r\nredoubled fury, once more charged upon her assailant, and, as before,\r\nwas met by the hard convex surface of the shield.  This time she did not\r\nimmediately retreat, but stood menacing the strange object, striking it\r\nwith her clawed hoofs, and endeavouring to turn it over.\r\n\r\nNow was the moment of peril for Congo.  Had the lioness succeeded in\r\nmaking a capsize, it would have been all up with him, poor fellow!  But\r\nhe knew the danger, and with one hand clutching the leathern straps, and\r\nthe other bearing upon the edge of the frame, he was able to hold firm\r\nand close,--closer even \"than a barnacle to a ship's copper.\"\r\n\r\nAfter venting her rage in several impotent attempts to break or overturn\r\nthe carapace, the lioness at length went growling away towards her\r\nformer position.\r\n\r\nHer growls, as before, guided the actions of Congo.  He was soon upon\r\nhis feet, another assegai whistled through the air, and pierced through\r\nthe neck of the lioness.\r\n\r\nBut, as before, the wound was not fatal, and the animal, now enraged to\r\na frenzy, charged once more upon her assailant.  So rapid was her\r\nadvance that it was with great difficulty Congo got under cover.  A\r\nmoment later, and his ruse would have failed, for the claws of the lion\r\nrattled upon the shield as it descended.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded, however, in planting himself firmly, and was once more\r\nsafe under the thick buffalo hide.  The lioness now howled with\r\ndisappointed rage; and after spending some minutes in fruitless\r\nendeavours to upset the shield, she once more desisted.  This time,\r\nhowever, instead of going away, the angry brute kept pacing round and\r\nround, and at length _lay down within three feet of the spot_.  Congo\r\nwas besieged!\r\n\r\nThe boys saw at a glance that Congo was a captive.  The look of the\r\nlioness told them this.  Though she was several hundred yards off, they\r\ncould see that she wore an air of determination, and was not likely to\r\ndepart from the spot without having her revenge.  There could be no\r\nquestion about it,--the Kaffir was in \"a scrape.\"\r\n\r\nShould the lioness remain, how was he to get out of it?  He could not\r\nescape by any means.  To raise the shield would be to tempt the fierce\r\nbrute upon him.  Nothing could be plainer than that.  The boys shouted\r\naloud to warn him of his danger.  They feared that he might not be aware\r\nof the close proximity of his enemy.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the danger there was something ludicrous in the\r\nsituation in which the Kaffir was placed; and the young hunters, though\r\nanxious about the result, could scarce keep from laughter, as they\r\nlooked forth upon the plain.\r\n\r\nThere lay the lioness within three feet of the shield, regarding it with\r\nfixed and glaring eyes, and at intervals uttering her savage growls.\r\nThere lay the oval form, with Congo beneath, motionless and silent.  A\r\nstrange pair of adversaries, indeed!\r\n\r\nLong time the lioness kept her close vigil, scarce moving her body from\r\nits crouching attitude.  Her tail only vibrated from side to side, and\r\nthe muscles of her jaws quivered with subdued rage.  The boys shouted\r\nrepeatedly to warn Congo; though no reply came from the hollow interior\r\nof the carapace.  They might have spared their breath.  The cunning\r\nKaffir knew as well as they the position of his enemy.  Her growls, as\r\nwell as her loud breathing, kept him admonished of her whereabouts; and\r\nhe well understood how to act under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nFor a full half-hour this singular scene continued; and as the lioness\r\nshowed no signs of deserting her post, the young yagers at length\r\ndetermined upon an attack, or, at all events, a feint that would draw\r\nher off.\r\n\r\nIt was close upon sunset, and should night come down what would become\r\nof Congo?  In the darkness he might be destroyed.  He might relax his\r\nwatchfulness,--he might go to sleep, and then his relentless enemy would\r\nhave the advantage.\r\n\r\nSomething must be done to release him from his narrow prison,--and at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nThey had saddled and mounted their horses, and were about to ride forth,\r\nwhen the sharp-eyed Hans noticed that the lioness was much farther off\r\nfrom the shield than when he last looked that way.  And yet she had not\r\nmoved,--at all events, no one had seen her stir--and she was still in\r\nthe very same attitude!  How then?\r\n\r\n\"Ha! look yonder! the shield is moving!\"\r\n\r\nAs Hans uttered these words the eyes of all turned suddenly upon the\r\ncarapace.\r\n\r\nSure enough, it was moving.  Slowly and gradually it seemed to glide\r\nalong the ground, like a huge tortoise, though its edges remained close\r\nto the surface.  Although impelled by no visible power, all understood\r\nwhat this motion meant,--Congo was the moving power!\r\n\r\nThe yagers held their bridles firm, and sat watching with breathless\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes more the shield had moved full ten paces from the\r\ncrouching lioness.  The latter seemed not to notice this change in the\r\nrelative position of herself and her cunning adversary.  If she did, she\r\nbeheld it rather with feelings of curiosity or wonder than otherwise.\r\nAt all events, she kept her post until the curious object had gone a\r\nwide distance from her.\r\n\r\nShe might not have suffered it to go much farther; but it was now far\r\nenough for her adversary's purpose, for the shield suddenly became\r\nerect, and the Kaffir once more sent his assegai whirring from his hand.\r\n\r\nIt was the fatal shaft.  The lioness chanced to be crouching broadside\r\ntowards the hunter.  His aim was true, and the barbed iron pierced\r\nthrough her heart.  A sharp growl, that was soon stifled,--a short\r\ndespairing struggle, that soon ended, and the mighty brute lay\r\nmotionless in the dust!\r\n\r\nA loud \"hurrah!\" came from the direction of the camp, and the young\r\nyagers now galloped forth upon the plain, and congratulated Congo upon\r\nthe successful result of his perilous conflict.\r\n\r\nThe group of dead bodies was approached, and there a new surprise\r\nawaited the hunters.  The lion was dead, as they had long since\r\nconjectured,--the sharp horns of the oryx had done the work; but what\r\nastonished all of them was, that the horns that had impaled the body of\r\nthe great lion still remained sticking in his side.  The oryx had been\r\nunable to extricate them, and would thus have perished along with her\r\nvictim, even had the lioness not arrived to give the fatal blow!\r\n\r\nThis, both Congo and Swartboy assured the party, was no uncommon\r\noccurrence, and the bodies of the lion and gemsbok are often found upon\r\nthe plains locked in this fatal embrace!\r\n\r\nThe cow gemsbok, yielding the more tender venison, was soon skinned and\r\ncut up; and as the delicious steaks spurted over the red coals of their\r\ncamp-fire, the young yagers became very merry, and laughed at the\r\nsingular incidents of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHT.\r\n\r\nA SHORT CHAT ABOUT LIONS.\r\n\r\nBefore going to supper the hunters dragged the carcasses of both lion\r\nand lioness close up to the camp-fire.  A good pull it was, but they\r\nmanaged it by attaching strong \"rheims\" of raw hide around the necks of\r\nthe creatures, and sliding them with the grain of the hair.\r\n\r\nTheir object in bringing them to the fire was, that they might have\r\nlight to skin them,--not that they deem the lion-hides of any great\r\nvalue, except as trophies of their expedition--and they were not going\r\nto leave such trophies on the plain.  Had the lions been permitted to\r\nremain all night where they had been killed, the hyenas would have eaten\r\nthem up before morning,--skins and all.  It is a fable which tells that\r\nthe hyena will not eat the dead lion.  The filthy brute will eat\r\nanything, even one of his own kind,--perhaps the most unpalatable morsel\r\nhe could well find.\r\n\r\nOf course the oryx were also brought up to the camp to be skinned and\r\ncut up.  The bull, as large and heavy as a dead ass, gave them a good\r\npull for it.  But it afforded Groot Willem an opportunity of exhibiting\r\nhis enormous strength; and the big boy, seizing the tow-rope, dragged\r\nthe oryx after him with as much ease as if it had been a kitten at the\r\nend of a string of twine.\r\n\r\nBoth the gemsboks were regularly \"butchered\" and cut into quarters, to\r\nbe carried to the next camp, and there dried.  They would have dried the\r\nmeat on the spot, but the water where they had halted was not good, and\r\nthey did not wish to remain there another day.\r\n\r\nThe horns of the oryx are also esteemed trophies of the chase, and those\r\nof both that were killed being perfect specimens--long, handsomely\r\nringed, and black as ebony--were added to the collection which the young\r\nyagers were forming, and stowed safely away in the wagons.  The heads,\r\nwith the skins left on, were carefully cleaned and preserved, at no\r\ndistant day to become ornaments in the _voor-huis_, or entrance-hall,\r\neither of the Von Bloom or Van Wyk mansions.\r\n\r\nAll these matters being arranged, the yagers sat down to supper around\r\nthe camp-fire.  The roast ribs and steaks of the gemsbok venison proved\r\ndelicious, and the whole party, as already stated, were contented and\r\nmerry.  Of course lions were the subject of conversation, and all\r\nlaughed again and again whenever they thought of Congo and his\r\nencounter.\r\n\r\nAll of them, little Jan and Klaas excepted, had stories to tell of\r\nadventures with lions, for these animals were still to be found in the\r\nGraaf Reinet, and both Groot Willem and Arend had been present at more\r\nthan one lion-hunt.  Hans and Hendrik had met them in many an encounter\r\nduring the great elephant expedition, and Swartboy was an old Hottentot\r\nlion-hunter.\r\n\r\nBut Congo seemed to know more of the lion than even Swartboy, though the\r\nlatter would have gone wild had such a thing been hinted at by any one\r\nof the party; and many a rival story of strange interest fell from the\r\nlips of both Kaffir and Bushman at that same camp-fire.  Some of the\r\nparty had heard of a mode of lion-hunting practised by the Bechuana\r\ntribes, and, indeed, in Congo's own country.  There was nothing very\r\nnovel about the mode.  A number of people,--naked savages they were,--\r\nattacked the lion wherever they met him, either in the bush or on the\r\nopen plain, and there fought him to the death.  These people carried for\r\narms only the assegai, and, as a sort of defensive weapon, a mop of\r\nblack ostrich-feathers fastened upon the end of a slender stick, and\r\nsomewhat resembling a large fly-brush.  The object of this was to\r\ndisconcert the lion when rushing upon the hunter.  By sticking it in the\r\nground at the right moment, the lion mistakes the clump of\r\nostrich-feathers for his real assailant, and, charging upon it, permits\r\nthe hunter to escape.  Such a _ruse_ is far inferior to the trick of the\r\ncarapace, but that singular mode of defence against the lion was only\r\npractised by such cunning hunters as Congo.\r\n\r\nNow, as already stated, the plan practised by the Bechuana savages had\r\nnothing very novel or strange in it.  Any strangeness about it consisted\r\nin the fact of the imprudence of such a mode of attack; for it was said\r\nthat the hunters did not stand off at a distance and cast their\r\nassegais, on the contrary, they retained these weapons in their hands,\r\nand used them as spears, approaching the lion close enough to thrust\r\nthem into his body!  The consequence was, that in every encounter with\r\ntheir terrible antagonist, several hunters were either killed or badly\r\nmangled.  This was the thing that appeared strange to our young yagers.\r\nThey could not understand why any hunters should attack the fierce lion\r\nthus boldly and recklessly, when they might avoid the encounter\r\naltogether!  They could not understand why even savages should be so\r\nregardless of life.  Was it true that any people hunted the lion in that\r\nway?  They asked Congo if it was true.  He replied that it was.\r\n\r\nNow this required explanation,--and Congo was requested to give it,\r\nwhich he did as follows.\r\n\r\nThe hunters spoken of were not _volunteers.  They did not attack the\r\nlion of their own will and pleasure, but at the command of the tyrant\r\nthat ruled them_.  It was so in Congo's country, where the sanguinary\r\nmonster, Chaaka, had sway.  The _whole people of Chaaka were his\r\nslaves_, and he thought nothing of putting a thousand of them to death\r\nin a single morning to gratify some petty spleen or dislike!  He had\r\ndone so on more than one occasion, often adding torture.  The tales of\r\nhorrors practised by these African despots would be incredible were it\r\nnot for the full clear testimony establishing their truth; and, although\r\nit forms no excuse for slavery, the contemplation of such a state of\r\nthings in Africa lessens our disgust for the system of American bondage.\r\nEven the atrocious slave-trade, with all the horrors of the \"middle\r\npassage,\" appears mild in comparison with the sufferings endured by the\r\nsubjects of such fearful tyrants as Chaaka, Dingaan, or Moselekatse!\r\n\r\nCongo related to the young yagers that it was customary for Chaaka's\r\npeople to act as the herdsmen of his numerous flocks, and that when any\r\nof his cattle were killed by a lion,--a frequent occurrence,--the\r\nunfortunate creatures who herded them were commanded to hunt the lion,\r\nand bring in his head, or _suffer death_ in case of failure; and this\r\nsentence was sure to be carried into effect.\r\n\r\nThis explained the apparently reckless conduct of the hunters.\r\n\r\nCongo further stated that he had been compelled to take part in several\r\nof these lion-hunts, in each of which the lives of men were sacrificed.\r\nHe spoke of one in particular where no less than ten hunters had been\r\nkilled before the lion was _captured_;--captured, not killed, for on\r\nthis occasion the despot had taken a whim into his head, and ordered the\r\nfierce animal to be _taken alive_!  His command was, that if the lion\r\nwere not brought before him alive, and without a wound or scratch, every\r\nman engaged in the hunt should suffer death!  As the unfortunate hunters\r\nwell knew the threat was no idle one, they caught the lion in their\r\nnaked arms, and succeeded in tying him, but not until ten of their\r\nnumber had fallen victims to their involuntary zeal!\r\n\r\nTo these and other tales of lions did the young yagers listen as they\r\nsat around the blazing camp-fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINE.\r\n\r\nTHE UNICORN.\r\n\r\nThe oryx next became the subject of conversation, and Swartboy could\r\ntell more about it than any one.  Of the oryx Congo knew very little, as\r\nthe region most frequented by this beautiful antelope lies farther west\r\nthan the country of the Kaffir tribes.  Its headquarters are in the land\r\nof the Namaquas, though it is thinly scattered all around the borders of\r\nthe Great Kalihari Desert.\r\n\r\nThe oryx is a desert-dwelling antelope, can live without water, and\r\ngrows fat even on the plants that thinly vegetate over the barren soil.\r\nIt is a bold creature--often beats off the lion, or kills him by\r\nimpalement on its long bayonet-like horns.  Of the truth of this fact\r\nour yagers had that day had proof.  The oryx when hunted does not, like\r\nmany other antelopes, make for either water or cover.  It strikes in a\r\nstraight line for its desert home, trusting to its heels for safety.\r\nAnd its confidence in them is seldom misplaced.  A swift horse alone can\r\novertake and bring it to a stand; unless it be very fat, and then it is\r\nmore easily \"blown.\"\r\n\r\nAn interesting point occurred in the conversation about the oryx.\r\n\r\nArend and some of the others had read in several books of travellers\r\nthat the oryx was supposed to be the fabled \"unicorn,\" derived from\r\nEgyptian sculptures.  They asked if this was the case.  Their question\r\nwas not put to Swartboy, you may be sure, but to Hans the naturalist, of\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nHans regarded the supposition as a very silly one.  A mere fancy of some\r\nearly South African traveller, that had been repeated, parrot-like, in\r\nthe books of other travellers and the writings of several\r\ncloset-naturalists.  The supposition of the oryx being the original of\r\nthe unicorn rested only upon the fact that its horns when seen _en\r\nprofile_ appear as but one; and the unicorn is so figured on the\r\nEgyptian sculptures.  Now this argument can be advanced in favour of\r\nseveral other antelopes, and therefore falls at once to the ground as\r\nregards the oryx.\r\n\r\nHans mentioned several reasons why the gemsbok could not be the \"fabled\r\nunicorn.\"  Its form, and particularly the shape of its head, are quite\r\nunlike the sculptures of that famous creature.  Its horns, both in\r\nlength and \"set,\" even when seen _en profile_, differ altogether from\r\nthat of the unicorn, which points forward, whereas the horns of the oryx\r\nextend backward almost horizontally, and sometimes even touching the\r\nflanks of the animal.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" continued Hans; \"if the Egyptian unicorn be not a fable--if it be\r\nthe representation of any animal in Africa, that animal is the gnoo; and\r\nI regard it as something singular that the resemblance between the\r\ngnoo--I mean the common species, not the `brindled'--and the fabled\r\nunicorn, has not long since been noticed by naturalists and travellers.\r\n\r\n\"I should fancy that no one could look upon the pictures of both without\r\nbeing struck by this resemblance.  Their forms, both of head and body,\r\nthe elegant rounding of limb, the split hoof, the long tufted tails, the\r\nproud arching necks, with full flowing mane,--all these points go to\r\nshow that the gnoo was copied for the unicorn.  The _one_ horn is the\r\nonly circumstance that appears to invalidate my theory, but even in this\r\nrespect the gnoo bears a much greater resemblance to the unicorn than\r\ndoes the oryx.  The horns of the gnoo are set in such a manner that it\r\noften appears a _unicorn_.  Their tips do not rise above the level of\r\nthe skull; and in consequence of this, and also from the manner in which\r\nthe animal frequently carries its head, only one horn is visible, the\r\nother being, inconspicuous against the dark ground of the head and mane.\r\nOften only half the horn appears at a distance, and is then seen\r\npointing forward and `set,' very similarly to the brow ornaments of the\r\nunicorn.\r\n\r\n\"The horn of the unicorn is usually represented quite straight in modern\r\npaintings; but this is not correct, according to the Egyptian sculpture,\r\nwhere a curve is given,--a positive imitation of the curve in the horns\r\nof the oryx!  Even though it were straight, this would scarce invalidate\r\nmy theory, for the horns of the young oryx are straight also, and we\r\nmight suppose a young one to be represented.\r\n\r\n\"I do not beg the question in this way, however,\" continued Hans, \"for I\r\nknow that whatever animal the Egyptians meant on their sculptures must\r\nhave been well known to them, and it is not likely that they would have\r\npictured a specimen of immature age.  The singular character of the\r\ngnoo, its odd and eccentric habits, as well as the eccentricity of its\r\nform and appearance, must have drawn attention to it from the earliest\r\ntimes, and such an animal would not fail to be pictured by the\r\nEgyptians.  As to the one horn, I regard the existence of that, either\r\nas the result of imperfect observation on the part of the Egyptian\r\nsculptors, or, what is more likely, a want of knowledge of their art.\r\nEgyptian sculpture is at best but a rude affair, and the peculiar curve\r\nand set of the oryx horns are difficult to depict.  Even in this very\r\nhour of high art, our painters do not give the most correct delineation\r\nof the head of a gemsbok.  So, you see, I make out a tolerably clear\r\ncase, that the gnoo of South Africa is the original of that mysterious\r\ncelebrity--the _unicorn_.\"\r\n\r\nThe naturalist had fairly established his point, to the satisfaction of\r\nall the young yagers, who then asked him some questions about the\r\nunicorn mentioned in the Bible.\r\n\r\n\"As to the unicorn of Scripture,\" replied Hans, \"that is a very\r\ndifferent affair.  There can be no mistake about the animal meant by Job\r\nwhen he wrote, `Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow?\r\nor will he harrow the valleys after thee?  Wilt thou trust him because\r\nhis strength is great? or wilt thou leave thy labour to him?'  This is,\r\nin reality, a unicorn--the _one-horned rhinoceros_.\"\r\n\r\nResuming the subject of the oryx, Hans informed his companions that this\r\nanimal formed the type of a genus of animals called _Oryx_, of which\r\nthere were three other species,--the \"addax,\" the \"abu-harb,\" and the\r\n\"algazel.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"addax\" (_Oryx addax_) is a native of Central Africa generally, and\r\nis nearly as large as the oryx; but its horns, instead of being\r\nstraight, are twisted spirally.  They are smaller in the female, which\r\nis agreeable to the usual disposition of these appendages, though\r\ncontrary to that of the horns of the gemsbok.  The colour of the addax\r\nis greyish-white over the body, and reddish-brown upon the head and\r\nneck, with a white patch across the face.  It is not gregarious, but\r\nlives in pairs on the sandy deserts, for traversing which its broad\r\nhoofs are peculiarly adapted.  It was known to the ancients, and Pliny\r\nspeaks of it under the name _Strepsiceros_.\r\n\r\nThe \"abu-harb\" (_Oryx leucoryx_) is also a large powerful antelope, with\r\nlong sharp horns slightly curved backward.  Its colour is cream-white,\r\nwith a brown mark on the forehead, another on the cheeks, and a\r\nrust-brown colour over the neck and throat.  In form it bears a good\r\ndeal of resemblance to the oryx, and was really the animal known by this\r\nname to the Greeks and Romans.  But naturalists now apply the name\r\n\"oryx\" to the gemsbok or Cape oryx, (_Oryx Capensis_).\r\n\r\nThe \"abu-harb\" is a native of Kordofan and Sennaar, and it is one of\r\nthose that are found upon the sculptures of Nubia and Egypt.  Unlike the\r\naddax, it is gregarious in its habits, and lives in large herds.\r\n\r\nThe fourth species of oryx is the \"algazel,\" (_Oryx algazella_).  This\r\nis also a native of Central Africa, but less is known of it than of any\r\nof the other three; and there are naturalists who regard it as merely a\r\nvariety of the \"abu-harb.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Hans had finished his learned discourse, it was full time for\r\nretiring to rest, so the whole party crept into their wagons, and went\r\nto sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TEN.\r\n\r\nTHE CAMEL-BIRDS.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the \"drift\" where they had crossed the Orange River, our\r\nhunters \"treked\" in a north-easterly direction.  Had they gone due north\r\nthey would soon have reached the rim of the Great Kalihari Desert--the\r\nSaara of Southern Africa.  Of course they could not have penetrated\r\nthis, and would necessarily have been compelled to head in a new\r\ndirection, either to the east or west.  But they had long since\r\ndetermined on an easterly course, as the region lying to the eastward of\r\nthe desert had the reputation of being a grand country for the large\r\nanimals--the buffalo, the elephant, and the camelopard; and the rivers\r\nin that part were filled with huge sea-cows (hippopotami) and gigantic\r\ncrocodiles.  That was the very country the young yagers wanted to be in.\r\n\r\nThey were not travelling without a guide.  Congo was their guide.  He\r\nknew every inch of the route.  He had promised to bring them into a\r\ncountry abounding in elephants and giraffes; and no doubt was\r\nentertained that the Kaffir would keep his promise.\r\n\r\nNext day they were on the move at an early hour.  They made a long day's\r\nmarch, and, halting a little before sunset, outspanned in a grove of\r\nmokhala-trees, standing upon the very edge of a bleak desert, that\r\nstretched before them as far as they could see,--and indeed much\r\nfurther.  This desert had a very arid and parched appearance, the only\r\nvegetation upon it being solitary plants of the arborescent aloe, with\r\nits large coral-red flower-spike, palm-like zamias, some species of\r\ncactus-like euphorbias, and here and there small clumps of _Acacia\r\nhorrida_, or \"wait-a-bit\" thorns, as these bushes are jocosely termed,\r\nfrom the disposition of their curved spines to hook upon the clothes of\r\nany one passing them.\r\n\r\nBoth plants and bushes grew far apart, and wide tracts of the plain\r\nappeared without even any of these to vary its brown monotony.  It was a\r\nsort of outlying spur of the Kalihari Desert, and they would have to\r\ncross it before they should reach the country promised by their guide.\r\nThere would be _fifty_ miles without vley, spring, or stream--_fifty_\r\nmiles from water to water.\r\n\r\nThey had outspanned by the last spring, which gurgled out among the\r\nroots of the mokhala-trees upon the very edge of the desert.  There they\r\nintended remaining for a couple of days to dry the flesh of the\r\ngemsboks, and also to recruit their animals and prepare them for the\r\nlong waterless journey of the desert,--a perilous passage.\r\n\r\nIt was near sunset when they had finished \"outspanning,\" having formed\r\ntheir camp in the centre of the mokhala grove, and not far from the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nHans, in a contemplative mood, had wandered to the edge of the grove;\r\nand, seating himself under one of the trees, whose full umbrella-like\r\ntop cast a fine shade, was gazing out upon the wide treeless waste.\r\n\r\nHe had not been long in this situation, when his attention was attracted\r\nto three upright forms that appeared upon the plain at the distance of\r\nsome hundred yards from the grove.  They were bipeds, for he saw them\r\nfrom head to heel.  Not human bipeds, however, but birds.  They were\r\n_ostriches_.\r\n\r\nThe merest child could have told that much--anybody--for who does not\r\nrecognise the great African ostrich at the first glance?  The size and\r\nform of the _Struthio camelus_ are too peculiar to admit of its being\r\ntaken for any other bird.  The American \"rhea,\" or the Australian\r\n\"emeu,\" might pass for its half-grown young, but a full-sized African\r\nostrich is not to be mistaken for any of its pigmy relatives, either in\r\nAustralia, New Zealand, the Indian archipelago, or America.  It is the\r\ngreat bird of birds--the biggest that carries feathers.\r\n\r\nOf course Hans knew the three to be ostriches the moment his eye rested\r\nupon them--a cock and two hens.  This was easily told, for there is as\r\nmuch difference between the male and female of these birds, as between\r\nthe brilliant peacock and his dingy spouse.  The greater size of the\r\nformer; the deep black colour of his body contrasting strongly with the\r\nsnow-white plumes of his wings and tail,--and in the desert these _are_\r\nsnow-white--distinguish him at once from his female companions.  Their\r\ncolour is a nearly uniform greyish brown, and they want those splendid\r\njet and snowy plumes that adorn the back of their lord and master, and\r\nwhich have been from all time so highly prized as ornaments by both\r\nsavage and civilised people.\r\n\r\nA cock and two hens they were, that presented themselves before the eyes\r\nof the young naturalist.\r\n\r\nThey were marching slowly along.  They were not affrighted.  They\r\nevidently had seen nothing of the camp.  How could they, as it was\r\nbehind the trees in the centre of the grove?  They occasionally bent\r\ntheir long necks to one side or the other, and cropped a leaf, or picked\r\nup a seed, but then continued their course.  From their following a\r\nstraight line Hans concluded they were not feeding in the regular way,\r\nbut bent towards some point, perhaps to their night resting-place.\r\n\r\nWhen first observed, they were coming in a side direction, that is,\r\ntransversely to the direction in which Hans himself was facing.  In a\r\nshort time they had passed before him, and were now widening the\r\ndistance, and getting farther off into the desert.\r\n\r\nHans at first thought of calling to the others, who were all busy about\r\nthe wagons, and had not seen the ostriches.  He was thinking also of\r\nsome plan by which the birds might be captured or killed.\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's consideration, he gave up the idea of either one thing\r\nor the other.  The sight of an ostrich was nothing new to any of the\r\nparty.  Jan and Klaas might have cared for it, but both were tired after\r\ntheir long hot ride, and had already fallen asleep on the grass.  Better\r\nnot disturb them, thought Hans.\r\n\r\nAs to the killing or capturing the ostriches, after a moment's\r\nreflection, Hans also gave up that design.  The birds were already\r\npassing--to have stalked within shot upon the naked plain would have\r\nbeen impossible, for Hans well knew the wary nature of the ostrich; and\r\nto have attempted a chase with their tired horses would have been\r\nequally idle.\r\n\r\nHans, therefore, held his peace, and sat still; following with his eyes\r\nthe retreating forms of the three great camel-birds.\r\n\r\nTheir long strides soon carried them far off, but before they had\r\nreceded half-a-mile, the eyes of the naturalist were removed from them,\r\nand turned on a different object.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER ELEVEN.\r\n\r\nTHE SMALLEST OF FOXES.\r\n\r\nThe object which now fixed the attention of the naturalist was a\r\nquadruped,--a very small one, not bigger than a medium-sized cat, but\r\naltogether different in form and proportions.  Unlike the cats, it had a\r\nlong sharp snout, and a thick bushy tail.  It stood higher upon its\r\nlegs, too, than do animals of the cat kind, but the most remarkable\r\n_feature_ about it was its ears.  These were remarkable for their\r\nlength, which was out of all proportion to the size of the creature.\r\nIts whole body was barely one foot long, and yet the ears stood full six\r\ninches above the crown of its head!  They stood quite erect, broad,\r\nstiff, and pointed, and ending in an acute angle at the tips.\r\n\r\nIts colour was a beautiful Isabella above, and cream-white underneath.\r\nNo; the creature was not like a cat, nor a dog neither, though it was\r\nmore like the latter than the former.  But there is an animal related to\r\nthe canine family to which it bore a very strong resemblance, and that\r\nis the fox, for it _was_ a fox, the very smallest in the world, the\r\n\"caama\" of Southern Africa.  And yet, correctly speaking, it was not a\r\nfox neither, but a _fennec_.\r\n\r\nWhat is a \"fennec?\"\r\n\r\nThat is an interesting question, and one about which naturalists have\r\nbothered their brains a good deal.  It is an animal of which there are\r\nseveral species existing throughout Africa; and of which the celebrated\r\ntraveller Bruce,--who, everybody thought, _lied_ so largely, but about\r\nwhom conceited ignorance has since changed its opinion,--first gave an\r\naccount.\r\n\r\nIt differs from the foxes in several respects, but the most remarkable\r\ndifference is found in the form of the eye.  In the true foxes the pupil\r\nis linear or elliptical, while that of the fennec is round, thus showing\r\nthe difference of habit--for the foxes are in reality _nocturnal_\r\nanimals, while the fennecs are _diurnal_.  Some species of foxes,\r\nhowever, are twilight prowlers, and one or two of the fennecs are also\r\ncrepuscular.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, scarce possible to draw a line of demarcation between\r\nthe two.  The fennecs, however, have been formed into a separate genus,\r\ntermed _Megalotis_, from the extreme size of their ears.  It is to be\r\nhoped that the question is thus settled that has so much bothered the\r\ncloset-naturalists; who, taking their ideas from the anatomy of the\r\nfennec, have classed it according to their several fancies; one making\r\nit a dog, another a cat, a third a fox, a fourth a civet, a fifth a\r\nhyena, and a sixth placing it among the galagos!\r\n\r\nLet us call it a \"fennec,\" or diurnal fox, and say farther that although\r\nthere are several species of _true foxes_ in Africa, and several of\r\n_jackal-foxes_, there are also several of fennecs.  Three are well\r\nknown.  The fennec of Bruce, (_Megalotis zerda_), first described by\r\nthat traveller as seen by him in Abyssinia, but also indigenous to South\r\nAfrica; the \"zabora,\" (_Megalotis famelicus_), a native of Nubia and\r\nKordofan, and supposed to be the animal represented on Egyptian temples,\r\nwhich has been taken for the figure of the jackal; and the \"caama\r\nfennec,\" (_Megalotis caama_).\r\n\r\nA fourth species, \"Lalande's zerda,\" (_Megalotis Lalandii_), has been\r\n\"hooked out\" of this genus, and made to form one of itself,\r\n(_Agriodus_), not because its habits in anywise differ from the\r\n_Megalotides_, but because it chances to differ slightly from them in\r\nthe form and arrangement of its \"ivories.\"\r\n\r\nNow of all these fennecs the one which was passing before the eyes of\r\nHans was the \"caama,\" the smallest of the whole tribe either of fennecs\r\nor foxes.\r\n\r\nCrouching just like a fox, now trotting nimbly a few paces, now halting\r\nand squatting close to the ground, as though fearful of being observed,\r\nthe little creature passed on.\r\n\r\nWhat was it after?  What prey was it in pursuit of?\r\n\r\nOn watching it for a few moments, Hans saw to his great surprise that it\r\nwas after the ostriches!\r\n\r\nIt was going the same way they had gone, its sharp snout set towards,\r\nand its eyes evidently bent upon, them.  Whenever they stopped it did\r\nthe same, squatting down as it did so, as if to avoid their observation;\r\nand when they moved on, it also trotted forward, halting at intervals\r\nbehind stones and bushes and earnestly regarding the birds in advance.\r\nBeyond a doubt it was trailing them!  But what could this little\r\ncreature want with the ostriches?  Certainly not to attack them, though\r\nit was following after them just as a fox would a covey of partridges.\r\n\r\nIt could not be that, however; as a kick from the mighty leg of one of\r\nthese birds would have hoisted the fennec fifty yards over the plain,\r\nlike a ball from a cricket-bat.\r\n\r\nNo; it could not be following them with hostile intentions,--puny pigmy\r\nthat it appeared beside the big camel-birds!\r\n\r\nFor what, then, was it trailing them?  Of course it was not running on\r\nthe scent, but the view.  On their track it certainly was, and as\r\ncertainly was it \"dogging\" them.  For what purpose?\r\n\r\nThis was just what the naturalist Hans wished to know; and he remained\r\nclosely observing the movements of this miniature \"microscopic\" fox.\r\n\r\nTalking of a microscope reminds me that Hans at that moment took out of\r\nhis pocket a telescope,--a small one, which he habitually carried.  This\r\nhe did, because, in a few minutes, the ostriches were very distant over\r\nthe plain, and their pursuer the fennec was no longer visible to the\r\nnaked eye.  With the glass, however, Hans could still make it out, and\r\ncould see that it was manoeuvring just as when it passed him.  All at\r\nonce the ostriches came to a stop; and, after an apparent consultation\r\namong themselves, the cock squatted down, and his long legs were no\r\nlonger seen.  He was flat down upon his breast, and even through his\r\nsmall pocket-glass Hans could tell that his body looked more spread and\r\nbulky than before.  Was he covering eggs?  Was there a nest?  The\r\nappearance of the ground about the sitting bird favoured that belief.\r\nThere was a slight prominence around the body of the bird having the\r\nsemblance of a bird's nest; but Hans knew that the nest of the ostrich\r\nis of very simple construction,--a mere cavity scratched out in the\r\nsand, and scarce to be recognised from any great distance.  Several\r\nwhite objects lying around the spot led Hans to the conclusion that\r\nthere _was_ a nest.  These objects did not seem larger than\r\n\"jack-stones,\" but Hans, calculating well the distance that separated\r\nthem from his eye, believed them to be ostrich-eggs, and therefore as\r\nlarge as paving-stones.  Hans knew that around the nest of the ostrich\r\nscattered eggs are usually found--said by some to be there laid as a\r\ndeposit for the food of the expected progeny during their early days of\r\nchickhood!\r\n\r\nThe two hens, after moving about awhile also squatted down, but they\r\nappeared only to kneel with their great legs doubled under them; whereas\r\nthe cock sat low and flat upon his breast.  This only more convinced\r\nHans that there was a nest, and that the cock ostrich was taking his\r\nturn of duty, while the hens were simply gone to roost in the usual\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nThat the cock covered the eggs was nothing surprising to the young\r\nnaturalist, who knew that it is the habit of the male of these birds to\r\ndo so, and that he usually takes his turn during the night, when it is\r\ncolder, and his greater size and strength are required to keep the eggs\r\nwarm, as well as to protect the nest from prowling beasts of prey.  One\r\nor other of the hens would very likely relieve him about daybreak.  Of\r\ncourse both the hens were mothers in prospective of the future brood, as\r\nthe cock ostrich is a terrible \"Mormon;\" and frequently does the\r\npolygamous on a large scale, having sometimes as many as a dozen wives.\r\nOur old fellow was rather a moderate Mormon, as he appeared to be\r\nsatisfied with two--though bigamy, no doubt, is quite as sinful as\r\npolygamy.\r\n\r\nHans concluded that there was a nest, and full of eggs in process of\r\nbeing hatched.  It was no evidence against this, that the birds had been\r\naway from it together.  The day had been a very warm one, and during the\r\nmiddle part of the day--particularly in hot weather--the ostrich wanders\r\naway from its eggs, leaving the sun to do its work for it.  The hotter\r\nthe country, the less does the ostrich require to \"set;\" and in parts of\r\nAfrica within the torrid zone where the heat reaches a very high degree,\r\nthe ostrich has very little to do with the hatching of its eggs, but\r\nburies them in the burning sand, and makes the sun its \"incubator!\"\r\n\r\nBut what had become of our fennec--poor little fellow?\r\n\r\nSo asked Hans of himself, as he swept the plain with his telescope.\r\nWhile watching the late movements of the birds, he had altogether\r\nforgotten the beast.\r\n\r\nAfter a time he was just able to make out its small whitish body\r\nstretched upon the ground, under the lee of a little bush, and\r\napparently resolved upon passing the night there.  Had there been any\r\nhole near, it would have preferred lodging in that--for the fennec is an\r\nanimal that makes its home in a \"burrow.\"\r\n\r\nNight had suddenly come on, and the darkness prevented Hans from\r\nobserving farther the movements of either beast or bird; so putting up\r\nhis glass, he rejoined his companions in the camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWELVE.\r\n\r\nTHE WINGLESS BIRDS.\r\n\r\nHans, on returning to the camp, gave an account of what he had seen.\r\nAll were interested in the relation, but particularly the boys Klaas and\r\nJan, who were not over satisfied that they had not themselves been\r\nwitnesses of the affair.  Hans might very well have told them of it.\r\nThey wouldn't have minded being waked up to see the ostriches,\r\nespecially as they passed so near.  It wasn't every day one could get\r\nsuch a view of these fine birds--they were so shy no one could get near\r\nthem, and Hans might very well have come into camp and told them, or\r\ncalled them, Klaas and Jan, to the spot.  Hans didn't care whether they\r\never saw any thing worth seeing--he didn't.\r\n\r\nSo grumbled Klaas and Jan, because Hans had not waked them out of their\r\nsweet _siesta_, to see three ostriches stalking over the plain, and not\r\ndoing any thing in particular.\r\n\r\nBut boys are boys, and so long as they _are_ boys, they will feel a\r\nwonderful interest in birds--especially when these birds stand nearly\r\nten feet high, and weigh three hundred pounds, as ostriches do.\r\n\r\nHad it been a buffalo, or a giraffe, or even an elephant, neither Klaas\r\nnor Jan would have so much cared.  Beasts are all very well in their\r\nway, and may interest full-grown hunters, like Hendrik and Groot Willem,\r\nbut for \"boy hunters,\" with light fowling-pieces and Number 5 shot,\r\nbirds are the game--though their Number 5 shot would hardly have tickled\r\nan ostrich.\r\n\r\nNo matter for that.  They wanted to see the great camel-bird.  Hans\r\nought to have apprised them.  It was \"right mean\" of him not to do so,--\r\nright mean, said Jan, and Klaas backed the opinion.\r\n\r\nHow long they might have grumbled, and given vent to their reproaches,\r\ncan only be guessed at; but the conversation turning upon ostriches\r\nassumed a very pleasing character; and Klaas and Jan, becoming deeply\r\ninterested in it, soon got over their little \"miff\" with Hans--\r\nespecially as it was he who was now interesting them.  Upon the subject\r\nof ostriches.  Hans had read a good deal, and was well acquainted with\r\nthe character and habits of these most interesting birds.\r\n\r\nSwartboy stood next in his knowledge of the ostrich, for Swartboy in\r\nearly life had been a \"dweller of the desert,\"--the home of the Bushman\r\nas well as the great camel-bird.  Swartboy was only too happy at the\r\nopportunity thus offered of showing off his knowledge, for the late\r\nwonderful performances of his Kaffir rival had quite thrown him into the\r\nshade.\r\n\r\nSo what with Hans's book-knowledge and Swartboy's practical experience,\r\nthe young yagers became pretty well acquainted with the whole \"history\"\r\nof the bird.\r\n\r\n\"The ostrich,\" said Hans, \"is an African bird, though also found in the\r\nadjacent countries of Asia.  Several species of birds somewhat like it,\r\nbelonging to South America, Australia and the islands of the Indian\r\nArchipelago, have been called `ostriches' in the language of travellers.\r\nI shall have a word about these presently.\r\n\r\n\"All over the African continent, as well as Arabia, Syria, and Persia,\r\ndwells the ostrich, wherever there are desert plains--for this bird is\r\npeculiarly a denizen of the desert, and never makes its home in wooded,\r\nmarshy, or even fertile districts.\r\n\r\n\"It has been known from the earliest times, and must have been more\r\nnumerous in the days of Heliogabalus than now, since that tyrant had the\r\nbrains of six hundred ostriches served up at a single feast!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the glutton!\" exclaimed Jan.\r\n\r\n\"What a gourmand!\" echoed Klaas.\r\n\r\n\"I should think after the feast he had more brains in his stomach than\r\nin his head,\" quietly remarked Arend.\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of it,\" added Hendrik.\r\n\r\nHans continued:--\r\n\r\n\"The ancients knew the ostrich as the `camel-bird,' (_Struthio\r\ncamelus_).  This name was given to it on account of its fancied\r\nresemblance to the camel; and in its hoof-like two-toed feet, its long\r\nnaked thighs and neck, and the pad or cushion on its chest,\r\ncorresponding to the callosity on the breast of the camel, it does bear\r\na resemblance to this animal.  Like it, too, the ostrich is formed for\r\nthe desert.  Aristotle and Pliny described the ostrich as half bird,\r\nhalf quadruped.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as Hans had given the more scientific part of the natural\r\nhistory of the ostrich, Swartboy's knowledge of the habits of the bird\r\nwas produced, and from both were collected the details that follow.\r\n\r\nOstriches are gregarious--flocks of _fifty_ may be seen upon the plains,\r\npeacefully associating with zebras, quaggas, wildebeests, blue\r\nwildebeests, and several other plain-frequenting antelopes.\r\n\r\nThe males are polygamous, and usually have from two to six wives.  These\r\nlay twelve to sixteen eggs each, in a nest which is only a hole scooped\r\nout in the sand about six feet in diameter.  Not more than half the eggs\r\nare deposited in the nest.  The others lie scattered around, and are\r\nnever hatched.\r\n\r\nSwartboy alleged that these were intended to feed the young when they\r\ncame out of the shell: but Hans dissented from this opinion.  The\r\nnaturalist believed that those scattered about were superfluous eggs,\r\nwhich were not deposited in the nest because one bird could not cover\r\nall that the whole family of hens would lay; and that once the \"setting\"\r\nwas complete, the superfluous eggs were dropped about anywhere.\r\n\r\nThere is a good deal of probability in this conjecture of the young\r\nnaturalist.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that the scattered eggs are those last laid, and that the\r\nbirds continue to drop them after the incubation has commenced, but\r\nwhether they form the food of the young is a disputed point.  One bird\r\ncan cover from thirty to forty, placed as they usually are upon their\r\nends, and Swartboy said that he had often found this number in a nest,\r\nbut more frequently thirty was the \"setting.\"\r\n\r\nThe male takes part in the incubation, sitting during the night; when\r\nhis greater size and strength enable him the better to protect the eggs\r\nfrom cold.  The \"hens\" relieve one another during the day, but when the\r\nsun is hot all leave the nest to itself, for hours at a time.\r\n\r\nHans stated, that in the more tropical regions the eggs are forsaken for\r\nlong spells, and the hot sand and _sun_ do the work of the parent birds;\r\nand that on this account the period of incubation is not fixed, but\r\nranges from thirty to forty days.\r\n\r\nThe young when hatched are well developed, and in a day or two become as\r\nlarge as guinea-hens, leaving the nest and running about in charge of\r\nthe parent birds.\r\n\r\nAt this period the old ones are very careful of their offspring.  When\r\nan enemy approaches, the hen that has charge of the flock will endeavour\r\nto attract the intruder upon herself, making a feint of being wounded,\r\nspreading and drooping her wings, and tumbling from side to side along\r\nthe ground, while the cock draws off the chicks in an opposite\r\ndirection!  Partridges, wild ducks, and many other birds, do the same.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the ostrich are of a dull white colour.  They are not all of\r\nequal size, nor are the birds either.  A medium-sized ostrich-egg is six\r\ninches long, and weighs about three pounds.  It is excellent eating when\r\nbroiled among hot cinders, and is a meal for a man,--some say two, some\r\nthree, while others allege that it is not enough for one.  But \"a meal\r\nfor a man\" is a very uncertain standard, and depends a good deal on the\r\ncapacity of the man's stomach and the state of his appetite.  A better\r\nstandard is found in the estimate that one ostrich-egg is equal in\r\nquantity to twenty-four of the common domestic fowl.\r\n\r\nThe shells of the ostrich-eggs are very strong, and used by the Bushmen\r\nand other natives of the desert as water-vessels--the only vessels that\r\nsome of them have.\r\n\r\nA full-grown cock ostrich stands over nine feet in height, and weighs\r\nthree hundred pounds.  The legs of such a bird are immensely thick and\r\nmuscular, and the thigh-joint equals in size the largest leg of mutton.\r\n\r\nThe ostrich is thought to be the swiftest runner in creation, but there\r\nare doubts about this.  Certain it is that it cannot be overtaken by a\r\nhorse in a fair tail-on-end chase; but the bird makes \"doubles\" in\r\nrunning, and by observing these, the mounted hunter sometimes gets near\r\nit by making a cut upon it, and delivers his fire as it passes.  To run\r\nan ostrich down, however, is considered an impossibility, even by the\r\nArab on his fleet steed.  Its bottom is equal to its speed, as it can\r\nkeep up the pace for hours together.\r\n\r\nThe muscular strength of its great long legs is well adapted for running\r\nfast and far; and while on the run, its hoofs make a clatter like those\r\nof a trotting horse, while large stones are flung violently to the rear!\r\nWhen at full speed it spreads its white wing-plumes, raising them over\r\nits back, but this is only done to balance it, as it could not fly a\r\nsingle yard.\r\n\r\nIts principal weapon of defence is the leg with its hoof-like foot.\r\nWith this it can kick like a mule, and the blow will break a man's leg,\r\nor send the breath out of his body, as would the kick of a horse!\r\n\r\nBut the principal security of the ostrich lies in its splendid power of\r\nvision, combined with its peculiar habitat.  It is always on the naked\r\nplain, with nothing to interrupt the view, and its keen eye enables it\r\nto perceive an enemy long before the latter can get near enough to do it\r\nan injury.  So sharp is its sight, it can see even farther than it can\r\nbe seen, large as it is!\r\n\r\nA most difficult matter it is to get within shooting distance of these\r\nwary birds.  Sometimes a shot is obtained by lying in wait for them at\r\nvleys, or springs, where they come to drink.  Many people deny that they\r\never drink, as they are met with at great distances from water; but it\r\nshould be remembered that what may appear a great distance to a tired\r\ntraveller may be nothing to a fleet ostrich, who can fling the miles\r\nbehind like a race-horse.\r\n\r\nOthers have observed the ostrich come to drink at a particular place\r\nonce every day; and it is well known that in captivity they swallow\r\nlarge quantities of water.  After drinking they do not run so well, and\r\nhunters take advantage of this and run them down after leaving the pool.\r\n\r\nThere are hunters residing upon the desert karoos, who hunt the ostrich\r\nas a profession.  The feathers are of considerable value, as well as the\r\nskin, which is tough and strong, and tans into a fine species of\r\nleather, out of which jackets and other garments are made.  A skin\r\nwithout the feathers is worth about one pound sterling; and the long\r\nwhite plumes of the wings and tail,--of which there are five-and-forty\r\n(the finest are from the wings,)--are often sold for a shilling apiece\r\non the spot.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem observed that the ostrich may be easily domesticated, and\r\nhe had frequently seen tame ones about the kraals of the frontier boors.\r\nThey are a useless pet, however; and, although quite harmless as far as\r\nman is concerned, they become troublesome in the farm-yard, where they\r\ntrample the poultry to death, and sometimes gobble up chicks and young\r\nducks, not from any carnivorous propensity, but on account of their\r\nextreme voracity: an old rag would be swallowed in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe proper food of the ostrich is tops of shrubby plants, with grain and\r\nseeds, though they \"bolt\" many odd and indigestible substances.  They\r\nare fond of salt, like most wild animals, and are often seen in large\r\nflocks around the salt-pans, or \"salines,\" many of which exist upon the\r\ndesert plains of Africa.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the young ostrich is very palatable, but that of an old\r\nbird is rather tough and rank.  Their eggs, however, are esteemed a\r\ndelicacy, though some think them heavy.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the ostrich under ordinary circumstances is a deep sonorous\r\nchuckle, though at times it gives out a roar resembling that of the\r\nlion.  When wounded or brought to bay, it hisses like an enraged gander.\r\n\r\nSo much for the ostrich; and now Hans proceeded, as he had promised, to\r\nsay a word or two about its relatives.\r\n\r\nThe \"rhea\" is its South American representative, but it has been lately\r\ndiscovered that there are two distinct species in South America, the\r\n\"nandu,\" (_Rhea Americana_), and the \"petise,\" or Darwin's rhea, (_Rhea\r\nDarwinii_).  They resemble each other in form, colour, and general\r\nhabits, but differ in size and geographical range.  The nandu is the\r\nlarger, and dwells upon the wide plains of La Plata, whereas the petise\r\nis confined to the southern part of Patagonia.\r\n\r\nThe nandu resembles the African bird in form, and its dingy brown colour\r\nis not far from that of the hen ostrich.  Its size, however, is much\r\nless, being only five feet in height.  The plumes of its wings are less\r\nbeautiful and valuable than those of its African cousin, though they are\r\nalso a marketable article, being used for fly-brushes and other\r\nhousehold implements.\r\n\r\nThe habits of the rhea show a great similarity to those of the\r\n_Struthio_, and it is quite a folly to make separate genera of them.\r\n\r\nThe rhea is gregarious, polygamous, scoops a slovenly nest in the\r\nground, hatches from twenty to thirty eggs, scatters many others around,\r\nruns swiftly when pursued, hisses and kicks violently when assailed, and\r\nis shy and wary.  All these are habits of the ostrich.  The rhea,\r\nhowever, has some peculiarities.  It feeds upon small fish cast up on\r\nthe mud banks of rivers, and on roots and grass.  It also takes freely\r\nto the water, and can cross rapid streams by swimming.  The gauchos hunt\r\nit with both _lazo_ and _bolas_.\r\n\r\nDarwin's rhea is less in size, but very similar in colour, form, and\r\nhabits.  It also swims well, and frequents plains near the coast.  It is\r\nbeyond doubt a very closely allied species to _Rhea Americana_, but a\r\nbird of a colder habitat.\r\n\r\nThe nandu is not found in North America, nor any species of bird allied\r\nto the ostrich.  In this respect Nature has neglected the vast desert\r\nplains of prairie-land.\r\n\r\nEven in South America the range of the rhea is limited, and does not\r\nextend to the equator, though it comes much farther within the tropics\r\nthan is generally imagined.  It has lately been seen on the savannahs of\r\nthe Madeira River, far to the north of the La Plata plains.\r\n\r\nAnother cousin of the ostrich is the \"emeu,\" (_Dromanis Novae\r\nHollandiae_).  I give the clumsy title of the closet-naturalists, though\r\nthere is no reason in the world why this bird should be separated from\r\nthe genus of either ostrich or rhea, except to confuse the student of\r\nnatural history.\r\n\r\nIn form and habits it resembles both, and in colour it is quite like the\r\nrhea.  It is, however, a much taller bird--standing seven feet--and a\r\nfull-grown male approaches the standard of a hen ostrich.\r\n\r\nIt has all the characteristics of the ostrich--is gregarious,\r\npolygamous, nestles on the ground, shy, wary, runs swiftly, swims well,\r\nkicks so as to kill a dog or break the leg of a man, utters an odd\r\ndrumming note, and lays eggs nearly as large as those of the ostrich,\r\nbut of deep green colour.  The eggs of the rhea are of a bluish cast.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that, like the rhea, there are two species of emeu--\r\nanother and smaller one having been reported as existing in the northern\r\nparts of the great island of Australia.\r\n\r\nIn the peninsula of Malacca and the islands of the Asiatic Archipelago,\r\nthe ostrich has a representative that differs from it more than either\r\nrhea or emeu.  This is the cassowary, (_Cassuarius cassoar_).  Its body\r\nis covered with a thick coat of feathers of a deep black colour, and so\r\ndisposed as to present a hairy appearance, while its head and neck are\r\nnaked, the skin of these parts being of the loveliest blue-purple and\r\nscarlet blended together.\r\n\r\nThe cassowary differs from the ostriches in many respects.  It is not a\r\nbird of the desert, but dwells in fertile districts and feeds upon soft\r\nsucculent herbage.  It resembles the ostriches, however, in most of its\r\nhabits.  Like them it defends itself by kicking, deposits its eggs on\r\nthe ground, and leaves them to be hatched by the sun; is bold when\r\nassailed, is fleet and strong, and altogether may be regarded as one of\r\nthe most interesting of the tribe, or of birds in general.\r\n\r\nHans mentioned the \"apteryx,\" or kiwi-kiwi, only to say that there were\r\ntwo species of it very much alike, both natives of New Zealand, both\r\nnocturnal and burrowing in their habits; and Hans added that he did not\r\nregard them as belonging to the ostrich family at all, any more than the\r\n\"auks\" or \"penguins.\"  Thus ended the talk about the wingless birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE FENNEC AND THE OSTRICH-EGGS.\r\n\r\nBefore retiring to rest, the young yagers had resolved upon a pleasant\r\nperformance for the morrow--that was, a \"surround\" of the ostriches.\r\nThey had planned it that Hendrik and Groot Willem should go first, and\r\nride a large circuit around, so as to get far beyond the nest.  Arend\r\nand Hans would start shortly after taking different sides, while Klaas\r\nand Jan should cover the direction towards the camp.  In this way the\r\nsix, widely separated from each other, would enclose the birds in a\r\ncircle; and when the latter became alarmed and started to run, they were\r\nto be \"headed\" by whoever was nearest, and turned back to the opposite\r\nside.  This is the mode practised by the South African hunters, and is\r\nthe only way by which the ostrich can be tired out and run down, for on\r\nsuch occasions, if the \"surround\" be well managed, the bird becomes\r\nconfused, runs from one side to the other, and at length suffers itself\r\nto be captured or shot.  It is a dangerous matter, however, to approach\r\ntoo near the game even when \"blown\" or wounded.  A wounded ostrich has\r\nbeen known to send the hunter sprawling, and break a leg or an arm, or a\r\npair of ribs, by one fling of its muscular limb!  Hans, in his usual\r\nprudent way, had cautioned his companions to beware of this danger.\r\n\r\nThey all went to rest with feelings of pleasant anticipation for the\r\nmorrow.  They had high hopes they would either kill or capture the old\r\ncock, and pluck his snow-white plumes to add to their \"trophies.\"\r\n\r\nThe only drawback upon their plans appeared to be their number.  They\r\nhad doubts whether six could surround the ostriches, so as to head and\r\nturn them--especially as of the six two were little boys mounted on\r\nsmall ponies, for the chargers ridden by Klaas and Jan were of this\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIt was resolved, however, that Congo and Swartboy should help to form\r\nthe circle.  They had no horses, but both were active afoot, and either\r\ncould run quite as fast as the ponies.  The one armed with his assegais,\r\nand the other with his tiny bow and poisoned arrows, they would be well\r\nworth a place in the ring; and the ostriches would thus have eight,\r\ninstead of six, points in the compass closed up against them.  Add to\r\nthis, that there were the six buck-dogs to assist them, and it will be\r\nacknowledged that their prospect of capturing the ostriches was not so\r\nbad.\r\n\r\nSad to say, their hopes of a brilliant day's sport ended in complete\r\ndisappointment.  All their fine plans were frustrated by a singular\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nA hyena during the night had stolen into camp, and had eaten up the\r\ngirth and part of the flaps of Hendriks saddle; and before the damage\r\ncould be repaired the ostriches had gone off from the nest.\r\n\r\nThey were still around it when the hunters arose, but the delay in\r\nmending the saddle was fatal to the plan of a \"surround.\"  The morning\r\nwas a hot sultry one, and the birds leaving their business to the sun,\r\nwent early away.  Just as the boys were mounting, they saw them move off\r\nin long strides towards the opposite side of the plain.\r\n\r\nThey were soon out of sight of the naked eye; but Hans followed them\r\nwith his glass, until that also failed to keep them in view.\r\n\r\nIt was a great disappointment to everybody, just as it would be to a\r\nfield of fox-hunters, who, after getting into the saddle, had found\r\nthemselves driven back to their stables by frost and snow.  Hendrik was\r\nparticularly out of temper, on account of the ill luck that had befallen\r\nhis saddle; and if a hyena had shown itself at that moment, it would\r\nhave stood a fair chance of getting a bullet into its body.  All the\r\nothers, though in a less degree, shared Hendrik's uncomfortable\r\nreflections.\r\n\r\nAll six sat chafing in their saddles, not knowing what to do.\r\n\r\n\"Let us ride out to the nest,\" proposed Arend.  \"At all events, the eggs\r\nhave not `stole away.'  We'll get them, and, by the way, I shouldn't\r\nobject to an omelette for breakfast,\" (they had not yet breakfasted:)\r\n\"I'm tired enough of venison and dry biltong.  What say you?\"\r\n\r\n\"By all means,\" rejoined Groot Willem; \"let us bring in the eggs, and\r\nbreakfast on them--that is, if they're not too far gone.  I should like\r\nan egg for breakfast myself.  Come on then!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" cried Hans; \"stop a moment, yagers!  Perhaps we'll not be\r\ndisappointed--we may have a chase yet.\"\r\n\r\nHans had the glass to his eye as he spoke.\r\n\r\n\"What!\" inquired several; \"are they coming back?\"\r\n\r\nHans made no reply for a moment.  He could not be looking after the\r\nostriches.  His telescope was pointed in the direction of the nest.  The\r\nbirds were not there!\r\n\r\n\"It is it!--it is! the very creature itself!\" exclaimed Hans, in a\r\nhalf-soliloquy.\r\n\r\n\"What is it? what creature?\" demanded the boys.\r\n\r\n\"The fox!\" replied Hans.\r\n\r\n\"What fox!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, the fennec--the same I saw last night--yonder it is, though you\r\ncan't see it with the naked eye.  I can barely make it out with the\r\nglass.  It is up close by the nest of the ostriches, and appears busy\r\nabout something.\"\r\n\r\n\"The eggs, I warrant,\" suggested Groot Willem.\r\n\r\n\"A fox-chase! a fox-chase!\" exclaimed Hendrik, partially recovering\r\ntemper.\r\n\r\n\"A fox-chase!\" echoed Klaas and Jan.\r\n\r\n\"A fox-chase be it then,\" assented Hans; and all six set their horses in\r\nmotion, whistling to the buck-dogs to follow.\r\n\r\nThey headed directly for the ostriches' nest.  They were not going to\r\nmake a circuit for such an insignificant creature as the little fennec.\r\nThey knew that it could only escape them by getting to a hole, as they\r\nhad dogs that could trail and run it down go where it would.  It was\r\nprobable that its burrow was not very near.  It had evidently strayed\r\naway from home, and \"dogged\" the ostriches to their nest, so as to get\r\nat their eggs.  Swartboy alleged that such was its habit--that it was\r\nfonder of eggs than any other food--and that the eggs of the great bird\r\nwere its particular favourites.  That it was constantly roving about in\r\nsearch of ostrich-nests; and as these are very difficult, even for a fox\r\nto find, the fennec, when it suspects that the ostriches are laying,\r\nwill follow them for miles to discover the nest--just as Hans had seen\r\nthis one do.\r\n\r\nSwartboy had given all this information on the preceding night, which,\r\nof course, explained the mystery of such a small creature running upon\r\nthe trail of the great ostriches.  It was not _them_, but _their eggs_,\r\nit wanted.\r\n\r\nNow there was still a mystery Swartboy had not explained; and that was,\r\nhow this animal, when it found the eggs, was able to _get at their\r\ncontents_?  The shell of the ostrich-egg is thick and strong.  It\r\nrequires a considerable blow with some hard weapon to break it, and how\r\na puny creature, like the little fennec, could effect a breach was a\r\nmystery to all, but especially to the naturalist Hans.  The fennec was\r\nno stranger to him.  He had seen many of them in captivity.  He knew\r\nsomething of their anatomy.  He knew that their skulls were destitute of\r\nthe ridge in which the temporal muscles are inserted, and that\r\nconsequently they were weak-jawed animals--much more so than the common\r\nfox.  It was not possible for them to have broken the shell of an\r\nostrich-egg with their jaws.  He knew that it was equally impossible for\r\nthem to effect that purpose with the claws of their feet--the soles of\r\nwhich are covered with soft wool, as in the Arctic fox--a peculiarity\r\nconsidering that the fennec is an inhabitant of the hottest climes, and\r\none quite unexplained by naturalists!\r\n\r\nFrom the strength and structure of the animal, Hans believed it could no\r\nmore have got at the contents of an ostrich-egg than it could have eaten\r\nits way into the heart of a bomb-shell.\r\n\r\nSwartboy was here at fault.  He only knew that it _did_ get at the\r\ncontents, white and yolk; but _how_ he had never observed.  He could not\r\ntell.  He could not solve the mystery.\r\n\r\nThey had not long to wait in doubt about this matter.  In less than ten\r\nminutes after, the fennec himself presented the solution before the\r\nastonished eyes of the young yagers.\r\n\r\nWhen they had ridden up within some three hundred yards of the nest the\r\nlittle animal came under the view of all, and they pulled up to watch\r\nhis manoeuvres.  He was so busy about his own affairs, that he had not\r\nperceived their approach.  The ground was covered with soft sand, so\r\nthat the hoofs made no noise, and with all his keen sense of hearing--\r\nfor he possesses that in proportion to his large ears--he had not caught\r\na sound.  He was hard at work, and never looked towards them.  In fact,\r\nhe was seen to raise his head at intervals, and look towards the point\r\nwhither the ostriches had gone, and all his gazing was in that\r\ndirection.  The party had, therefore, a good view of the animal without\r\nbeing observed by him; and they watched his manoeuvres with interest.\r\n\r\nSwartboy and the Kaffir held the dogs in their leashes, and all remained\r\nsilent as statues.\r\n\r\nNow what was the little fennec doing?\r\n\r\nAt first the spectators were puzzled to make out, but presently all was\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\nWhen they first saw him he was at a distance of several yards from the\r\nnest, and going farther from it, on the opposite side to that where the\r\nhunters had halted.  His tail was towards them, and the fore-part of his\r\nbody appeared to be raised as if his paws rested upon something.  This\r\nsomething was seen to be an ostrich's egg.  He was pushing it before him\r\nalong the ground, using his feet alternately, and forcing the _egg_ to\r\nturn.  This action was similar to that of some unfortunate fellow on the\r\ntread-mill, except that it was voluntary on the part of the fennec.\r\n\r\nNow why was he rolling the _egg_?  Did he mean to transport it in that\r\nway to his burrow?  It would have been an arduous task, as it was not\r\nlikely his subterranean dwelling was anywhere in that neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nBut he had no such design.  His intention was to eat his breakfast on\r\nthat very spot, or at all events very near it; and the spectators soon\r\nsaw where his table was to be spread, for some of them now remembered an\r\nodd story they had heard of the caama, and already suspected his design.\r\n\r\nAbout three or four yards from his snout lay a stone.  It was a boulder\r\nof small dimensions, some twelve inches in height, but quite large\r\nenough for the fennec's purpose.  It was evident that he had a purpose\r\nwith this stone, for he was rolling the egg directly towards it.  Those\r\nwho had guessed his design were not disappointed.  When his snout was\r\nwithin about three feet of the stone, the fennec made a sudden rush\r\nforward, carrying the egg along by a rapid motion of his feet, until the\r\nhard shell came in contact with the harder rock.\r\n\r\nA \"crash\" reached the ears of the hunters, and, looking attentively,\r\nthey saw that the egg was broken into \"smithereens!\"\r\n\r\nThe breakfast of the fennec was now before him, and he at once set about\r\neating it, but the hunters were hungry too, their patience could hold\r\nout no longer, and spurring their horses and letting slip the dogs, they\r\ngalloped forward.\r\n\r\nIt was a short run for a fox to give.  The creature had hardly made good\r\na couple of hundred yards, before the buck-dogs threw him; and it was\r\njust as much as Swartboy could do, aided by his jambok of\r\nhippopotamus-hide, to save his beautiful skin from their jaws.\r\n\r\nThe eggs were soon collected.  Those in the nest had \"gone too far,\" as\r\nGroot Willem had feared: some contained chicks, and others were addled.\r\nBut of the ones scattered about several turned out quite fresh, so that\r\nthe hunters had omelette for breakfast, as they had wished.\r\n\r\nSwartboy showed them how to cook the eggs to perfection.  This mode was\r\nto set one end in the ashes, break a hole in the other, and then with a\r\nlittle stick keep stirring the contents until they were sufficiently\r\nbroiled.  That is an omelette of ostrich-eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FOURTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE BLAUW-BOKS.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the young yagers were not to be disappointed in a chase.  If\r\nthe fox of South Africa gives but poor sport, there are plenty of other\r\nanimals, neither so weak-limbed nor short-winded; and one of this kind\r\nit was their fortune to fall in with on that same day, and almost within\r\nthe hour.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the mokhala grove from that on which the ostriches\r\nhad been observed, lay a wide open plain.  It was not a desert, although\r\nit approached so near to one,--separated from it only by a belt of\r\ntimber.  It was a prairie or natural meadow, the grass--perhaps from\r\ncontrast with the broad brown expanse on the other side--having an\r\nextremely fresh green look.\r\n\r\nIt was a large plain, though not limitless to the view.  In the distance\r\ncould be seen a wood of the giraffe-acacia, or \"cameel-doorns,\" bounding\r\nthe horizon; and several clumps of these trees, with their umbrella-like\r\nheads and feathery fronds of pale green, stood isolated upon the plain,\r\ngiving the scene altogether an interesting aspect.  A very park appeared\r\nthis plain, with wide open pastures between its groves and coppices,\r\nmany of which were of such regular forms that one would have fancied\r\nthey had been planted to adorn it.\r\n\r\nSo lordly a park, such rich pastures, could not be untenanted; nor were\r\nthey.  There was no mansion, no house, not a trace of a human being to\r\nbe seen, but for all that the plain had its denizens.  Many forms could\r\nbe distinguished upon or around it, both of winged and wingless\r\ncreatures.  Birds and quadrupeds of rare and beautiful kinds made this\r\nfair scene their home.\r\n\r\nOver its greensward stalks the \"secretary,\" the true serpent-eater,\r\nhunting among the grass for his glittering prey.  Even without using his\r\nwings, he need not fear any of the crouching _carnivora_, as his long\r\nlegs suffice to carry him far beyond reach of either hyena, jackal, wild\r\ndog, guepard, or leopard.  Swift is he, almost as the great ostrich\r\nitself,--so swift as to have earned from the Arabs the singular\r\n_sobriquet_ of the \"Devil's horse.\"\r\n\r\nNot far off another tall bird stands erect upon the plain, but of very\r\ndifferent character and habits.  This is the \"pauw\" or \"wild peacock,\"--\r\na peacock only in the phraseology of the boors, for the bird is a\r\nbustard, and the largest of his tribe--the _Otis kori_.\r\n\r\nRunning from copse to copse, or feeding over the plain, may be seen\r\nflocks of the pearly guinea-fowl, (_Numida meleagris_), whose constant\r\nchattering grates harshly on the ear, resembling the metallic clanking\r\nof machinery, or the sharpening of a hundred saws.\r\n\r\nFrom tree to tree flutter gaudy parrots, green pigeons, and soft cooing\r\ndoves, and over flowery shrubs flit numerous species of tiny\r\n\"honey-suckers,\"--the African representatives of the humming-birds.\r\nSome trees carry the pensile nests of the weaver-bird, (_Ploceus_),\r\nhanging from their branches like large fruits, while many of the\r\ncameel-doorns are loaded with the vast thatch-like republican dwellings\r\nof the sociable grosbeak, (_Loxia socia_).\r\n\r\nBut birds are not the only tenants of this fair scene.  Quadrupeds, as\r\nbright and beautiful as they, haunt its verdant glades, or repose under\r\nthe grateful shadow of its acacia-groves.\r\n\r\nIn a few hours' ride one might see graceful antelopes of many species.\r\nThe nimble springbok--the gazelle of South Africa--might be observed\r\ntrooping over the sward, or bounding high in air either in sport or\r\nalarm--the orange \"hartebeest,\" and the purple \"sassybe,\" might be\r\nseen--the shaggy-maned eccentric gnoo, scouring the plain in circles--\r\ndroves of quaggas, or of the still more beautiful \"zebra of the plains,\"\r\n(_Equus Burchellii_), might be seen too, crouching around the copses,\r\nthe leopard, fair but fearful to look upon; and still more fearful to\r\nbehold the tawny tyrant of the scene--the lion.\r\n\r\nAll these creatures, and many more of equal interest, might come under\r\nthe eye of the traveller or hunter during a single day's ride through\r\nthat wild domain.\r\n\r\nThus full of life, what a contrast did this beautiful meadow present to\r\nthe monotonous waste of wilderness, that stretched away from the\r\nopposite side of the grove to the far horizon!\r\n\r\nBaulked in their projected \"surround\" of the ostriches--disappointed by\r\nthe \"poor sport\" which the fox had afforded, the hunter-boys were\r\ndetermined not to be \"choused\" out of a chase.  Some sort of one they\r\nwould have, if it were only a brush after springboks, for these, they\r\nknew, they could find at any time.  They were aware of the existence of\r\nthe fine plain--the edge of which came up within a few hundred yards of\r\ntheir camp.  They had pastured their cattle there on the evening before;\r\nand conjectured that it must be the haunt of many kinds of game.  For\r\nthis reason they now resolved upon making an excursion to that quarter,\r\nto hunt whatever might turn up.\r\n\r\nThey came to this determination, only after their return from the\r\nostriches' nest; but as they had made up their minds to it before eating\r\nbreakfast, they did not off-saddle, but kept their horses ready for\r\nbeing mounted.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the meal was over, they took once more to their saddles and\r\nrode off, the buck-dogs following at the heels of their horses.  Congo\r\nand Swartboy stayed by the camp.\r\n\r\nThey had not far to go, before coming in view of their game; and rare\r\ngame that was.\r\n\r\nThey were scarce yet a hundred paces from the camp, and just about to\r\nride out from the timber, when Hendrik, in the advance, suddenly reined\r\nup his horse, making a sign for the others to do the same.  All pulled\r\nup in a breath, and sat in their saddles, gazing out through the leaves.\r\nThough still within the shadow of the grove, all had a good view of the\r\nopen plain; and before them was a sight that would have warmed the\r\nhearts of older hunters than they.\r\n\r\nOut upon the plain, and directly in front of them, was a herd of noble\r\nantelopes.  They were neither gnoos, nor springboks, nor hartebeests,\r\nnor any of the common kinds that the party had already met with, and had\r\nhunted to their satisfaction.  Indeed, they were of a species that none\r\nof the six had _ever seen_ before, and they only knew them to be\r\nantelopes from the make of their bodies, the shape of their horns, and\r\nother points characteristic of these animals.\r\n\r\nThey were antelopes of large size, standing nearly four feet high,\r\nhaving sabre-shaped horns curving gently backward and ringed to within\r\nsix inches of their tips.  Their general colour was ashy grey, tinged\r\nwith raven-blue--the blue tint being caused by the deep black colour of\r\nthe skin shining through the hair.\r\n\r\nAlthough none of the party had ever seen such antelopes before, Hans,\r\nand also the hunters Hendrik and Groot Willem, guessed what kind they\r\nwere.  They were of a kind that once ranged the Graaf Reinet, and even\r\nas far south as the Cape itself, though there they were never common.\r\nThat was long before any of the young yagers had ever fired a gun or\r\nmounted a horse, but as these remembered having heard their fathers\r\ntalking of this animal--of its blue colour, of its long curving horns,\r\nof its fine outline of form, as well as bold fierce character--they\r\nrecognised those before them by the descriptions they had heard.  They\r\ncould be no other than _blue-bucks_, or _blauw-boks_ in the language of\r\nthe boors.\r\n\r\nHans, after eyeing them a moment, gave this as his opinion.  The species\r\nwas the blauw-bok, the _Aigocerus leucophea_ of modern systematists.\r\n\r\nNow of the group of antelopes to which the general name _Aigocerus_ has\r\nbeen given there are five species--all large noble animals, and all\r\ninhabitants of South Africa, and particularly the countries adjacent to\r\nthe Great Orange River.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the \"waterbuck,\" (_Aigocerus ellipsiprymnus_), which\r\nstands nearly four feet in height, is of bluish grey colour, frequents\r\nthe banks of rivers, takes the water freely--whence its trivial name--\r\nswims well, is bold, fierce, strong, and dangerous, when bayed or\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nSecondly, there is the \"takhaitze,\" (_Aigocerus barbatus_), nearly as\r\nlarge as the waterbuck, but distinguished by a long beard and mane.  The\r\ncharacter of the waterbuck for fierceness and daring also belongs to the\r\ntakhaitze, and both are swift runners.  The latter, however, is less\r\nattached to the water, and frequents a hilly region, browsing goat-like\r\nupon the leaves of the acacia.\r\n\r\nThe third of this genus is the \"roan antelope,\" (_Aigocerus equinus_), a\r\nstrong fierce animal, with horns curving backwards as in the blue-buck,\r\nbut thicker, and more rapid in the curve.  It is an antelope not of the\r\nplains, but a dweller in the hilly region.\r\n\r\nThe \"sable antelope\" (_Aigocerus niger_) is by far the most beautiful\r\nanimal of the group.  It is not many years since this antelope was made\r\nknown to science, having been discovered in South Africa by a keen\r\nBritish sportsman.  It is one of the largest of the race, standing four\r\nfeet six inches in height, and carrying a pair of scimitar-shaped horns\r\nover three feet in length.  Its colour is a deep glossy black or sable--\r\nwhence its specific appellation--though it is white underneath with\r\nwhite markings about the head and neck.  None of the antelopes of this\r\ngroup are of common occurrence even in their native haunts.  None of the\r\nspecies can be called gregarious--that is, they do not appear in large\r\nherds, like the springboks, gnoos, hartebeests, or bonteboks--though\r\nsmall troops of less than a dozen--families, in fact--may be seen\r\ntogether.  Oftener they are met with in pairs, or single individuals,\r\nand they are all scarce in the regions they inhabit when compared with\r\nthe vast herds of the more social kinds.\r\n\r\nThe blue-buck is now one of the very rarest of the group, so much so\r\nthat some naturalists believe it to be extinct.  That is not likely.\r\nAfrica is a large country.\r\n\r\nNow all this information was furnished by philosopher Hans.  He did not\r\noffer it just then--that is when they came in sight of the herd of\r\nblue-bucks; though he would, likely enough, had the others been inclined\r\nto listen to him.\r\n\r\nBut they were not.  The hunters Hendrik and Groot Willem were gazing\r\nwith eyes wide open, admiring the beautiful proportions of the\r\nblauw-boks, which promised them a glorious run.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTEEN.\r\n\r\nA BRUSH AFTER THE BLUE-BUCKS.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, there were seven antelopes in the herd.  One, an old\r\nbuck, larger than any of the rest, and having horns over three feet\r\nlong, was in the advance acting as leader.  When first observed, they\r\nwere approaching the grove of mokhalas--perhaps to reach the water by\r\nthe spring.  So thought the yagers, and held a hurried consultation\r\nabout it, as they watched the advance of the animals.  Hurried it was,\r\nand abruptly terminated, for before they could come to any definite plan\r\nof action, one of the buck-dogs, a young and half-trained animal, sprang\r\nforward out of cover, and opened his bay right in the faces of the\r\nantelopes.\r\n\r\nThe whole seven wheeled round in their tracks, and obedient to a\r\nsnorting signal of the leader, started back in the direction they had\r\ncome, going at top speed.\r\n\r\nOf course all idea of stratagem was foiled by the unexpected behaviour\r\nof the dog.  A straight tail-on-end chase was the only course left the\r\nhunters to follow; and, plying the spur, all the six shot out of the\r\ntimber, and rode \"view halloo\" over the open plain.\r\n\r\nA splendid chase it was for several minutes--the seven blue-bucks in\r\nadvance, the dogs in the middle, and the \"field\" following in the rear.\r\nA splendid chase, indeed!\r\n\r\nBut only for a few minutes did dogs, hunters, and game, maintain these\r\nrelative positions.  The horsemen spread first.  The ponies of Klaas and\r\nJan fell to the rear, and were soon distanced.  Then lagged the\r\nphilosopher Hans, whose cob, though steady under fire, and a good\r\nroadster, was no hunter; and, next, the handsome Arend,--who might have\r\ntaken a better place, for his steed was a good one.  But Arend cared but\r\nlittle for hunting, and less for hard riding under a hot sun; and having\r\npermitted himself to get so far behind that the view of the chase was no\r\nlonger interesting, he reined up under the shade of a cameel-doorn, and\r\ncommenced fanning himself with the gauntlet of his military glove!\r\n\r\nThere were two, however, who still rode to the dogs with the keen ardour\r\nof sportsmen--Hendrik and Groot Willem; and from a feeling of rivalry,\r\nas already hinted at, each was determined to be in at the death.\r\n\r\nBoth were well mounted, though very dissimilarly.  The horse that\r\nHendrik rode was a beautiful coal-black, of medium size, with a dash of\r\nthe Arab in him--just enough to make of him what is termed a \"hunter,\"--\r\na breed the finest in the world, and for all purposes, except\r\n_race-course gambling_, finer even than the Arabian itself.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem's horse differed widely from this kind; and the same\r\ndescription that has been given of Groot Willem, or one very similar,\r\nwould answer for his steed.\r\n\r\nIn size, he bore the same proportion to Hendrik's hunter that his rider\r\nbore to Hendrik--that is, he was a full half bigger; but his own members\r\nwere out of all proportion with each other.\r\n\r\nHis body was flat and gaunt, and his limbs long and bony.  His neck also\r\nwas of an immense length, without the slightest semblance of a curve;\r\nand his head was angular and \"bumpy,\" like that of a giraffe.  He had\r\nother points of similarity to this singular quadruped, in his rough\r\nawkward gait, and long-stumped thin-haired tail; and the young yagers,\r\nin view of these resemblances, had jocosely christened him\r\n\"Groot-Kameel,\" (Great Camel).  He was about as ugly a horse as could\r\nhave been found in all the land of the boors; and yet his owner, Groot\r\nWillem, would not have exchanged him for the handsomest horse in Africa.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding his ugliness, he was a good horse.  In jockey phrase, \"a\r\nbad 'un to look at, a good 'un to go.\"  Groot Willem was no man for\r\nappearances.  He liked performance better than promise; and the \"Great\r\nCamel\" was the type of that idea--he promised nothing, but performed\r\namazingly.  Many a quagga, and wildebeest and sassybe, had he ridden\r\ndown; many a stanch buck-dog had he tired out and passed in the chase\r\nwith the heavy weight of Groot Willem on his back.  No wonder the latter\r\nfelt a high regard for his well-trained hunting horse.\r\n\r\nHendrik had an equal affection for his beautiful black; and as no\r\nopportunity had yet offered of a fair trial between the two steeds, a\r\ngood deal of talk had passed about their respective merits as regarded\r\nspeed and \"bottom.\"  On the question of beauty nothing could be said.\r\nHendrik had the advantage there; and even Groot Willem acknowledged it,\r\nat the same time that he sneered at _that_ being considered a \"merit\" in\r\na horse.\r\n\r\nThe chase of the blauw-boks seemed to offer the chance of a fair trial.\r\nThe animals had taken across the open plain, which would lead the\r\nhunters several miles at least, as the game was not one to be run down\r\nin a hurry.  In a ride like that before them, it would be seen which\r\nbacked the best steed.\r\n\r\nBoth riders were determined to make the most of their horses.  Both were\r\nwary hunters, and, instead of dashing forward at break-neck speed, it\r\ncould be seen that each was \"going cunning,\" and saving their steeds for\r\nthe final burst.  Hendrik felt that in speed for a mile or two he could\r\nhave headed the \"Camel\" easily enough.  But the bucks had got a good\r\nstart, and it was not likely he could overtake them within that\r\ndistance.  He held up, therefore, riding gently, lest in the end the\r\ngreat horse of his rival might come out too strong for him.\r\n\r\nFor some distance the two galloped \"cheek by jowl,\" the dogs far in the\r\nadvance, and the bucks still running together before them.  The latter\r\ndid not seek to escape into the bushes, though they passed near several\r\nlarge copses.  They kept in the open plain, in a course nearly direct.\r\nStag-like they were running for some water--as antelopes of the\r\n_aigocerine_ group habitually do.\r\n\r\nBut the dogs did not husband their speed, some of them were young and\r\nfoolish, although very swift; and before the bucks had passed over a\r\nmile of ground, two or three of their canine pursuers pushed them so\r\nclosely that the herd broke, and the antelopes, in their terror, forsook\r\neach other, and ran wildly in various directions.\r\n\r\nThe character of the hunt was now quite altered.  The pack split up just\r\nas the game had done, each dog following the antelope that seemed\r\nnearest him, and in a few moments the chase was scattered all over the\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nThe two hunters had now a choice, whether each should pursue a separate\r\ngame, or both take after the same.  But neither thought for a moment of\r\nseparating from the other, except by _heading_ him.  The spirit of\r\nrivalry, though silent, was strongly felt by both.  Even the very horses\r\nseemed to be actuated by a similar feeling, eyeing each other askance,\r\nas they galloped side by side!\r\n\r\nThe antelope that both were determined to follow was easily selected\r\nfrom the rest.  The old buck that hitherto led the herd had now gone off\r\nby himself, followed by a pair of the stanchest dogs.  _His_ horns were\r\nthe meteors that gleamed in the _eyes_ of our hunters, and beckoned them\r\non.\r\n\r\nWithout exchanging a word with each other, both rode after the buck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SIXTEEN.\r\n\r\nGROOT WILLEM GETS A TUMBLE.\r\n\r\nThe chase was now one of exceeding interest, and had become a simple\r\ntrial of speed between horses, dogs, and antelope.  The buck had kept on\r\nin a direct line, when the others broke away from him.  He had been\r\nforemost at the time, and had no need to turn out of his course.\r\nBesides he knew where he was running to.  Terror had driven the others\r\nout of their senses, and they had fled without design, while the old\r\nbuck, not losing his \"presence of mind,\" kept on for the water.\r\n\r\nA dark belt seen ahead was a forest fringing some stream or river.  That\r\nwas the point he was making for, but a wide plain must be crossed before\r\nhe could wet his hoof in any water.  Over this plain now swept the\r\nchase.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, the two dogs that had chosen the buck for their game were\r\nrival dogs--that is, each hunter was owner of one of them, and regarded\r\nhim as a favourite; and all three kinds, dogs, horses, and riders,\r\nseemed to be on their mettle, and were doing their very best.\r\n\r\nDo not fancy there was any ill-feeling between Groot Willem and Hendrik.\r\nNothing of the sort.  Each loved his horse and his dog, and wished them\r\nto excel--each had his hunter reputation at stake in the result--and\r\neach had resolved upon carrying the head and horns of that blue-buck in\r\ntriumph to the camp!\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, there was no \"bad blood\" between the boys.\r\nNothing of the sort.\r\n\r\nBeautifully the buck ran.  Lightly he leaped over the turf, his limbs at\r\neach spring stretching to an almost horizontal line, with head high in\r\nair and horns curving backward to his flanks.  Well and beautifully he\r\nran!\r\n\r\nSometimes he gained on his pursuers, as the nature of the ground\r\nfavoured his hoofs; but again the strong buck-dogs howled upon his\r\nheels, and the hunters galloped but a hundred yards behind him.  The\r\nblue of his back soon changed to a deeper tint, as the sweat poured\r\nthrough his sable skin, and the froth in large flakes clouted his neck\r\nand shoulders.  His red tongue hung dripping from his jaws, and the\r\nhunters might have heard his hard breathing but for the panting of their\r\nown steeds.\r\n\r\nFive miles did they go in that wild gallop--five miles without drawing\r\nrein or changing pace!\r\n\r\nThe woods were near--perhaps the water!  The buck would gain them if not\r\nhard pressed--there might be a deep reach of some large river--the\r\nblauw-bok can swim like a duck--he would plunge in--they could not\r\nfollow--they would lose him!\r\n\r\nWith such fears the hunters spurred their horses for a final burst.\r\nTheir speed had proved nearly equal.  Now was the time to try their\r\n\"bottom.\"\r\n\r\nBoth shot forward at the fresh touch of the steel; but at the second or\r\nthird spring the ground under the \"Great Camel\" gave way, and the huge\r\nhorse with his heavy rider rolled headlong to the earth!\r\n\r\nHe had broken through the burrow of the _aard-wolf_!\r\n\r\nHendrik, who had shot a little ahead, heard the confused noise behind,\r\nand, looking over his shoulder, saw Groot Willem and the \"Camel\"\r\nstruggling together over the turf.  A more attractive object, however,\r\nwas in front of him--the panting buck--and without making halt, or\r\nstaying to inquire whether his fellow-hunter was hurt--a pardonable\r\nneglect among sportsmen--he pressed his wearied horse still forward and\r\nonward.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes after, the buck stood to bay by the edge of the timber,\r\nand the dogs rushed up and sprang at him.  It was a fatal spring for one\r\nof them--the favourite of Groot Willem.  The luck was against him, as it\r\nhad gone against his master.  A single \"gowl\" came from his throat, as\r\nhe was flung back off the sharp horns of the antelope.  It was the last\r\nnote he ever uttered, for in a moment more he had kicked his last kick,\r\nand lay lifeless upon the plain!\r\n\r\nAnd very likely Hendrik's favourite would have shared the same fate; but\r\nhis master at this moment riding near, caused the blue-buck a fresh\r\nalarm, and he broke bay, and dashed into the bushes followed by the dog.\r\n\r\nHendrik now lost sight of the chase, though he could hear the breaking\r\nbranches, as the strong antelope made his way through the thicket, and\r\nthe baying of the dog still told him the direction in which the game was\r\ngoing.\r\n\r\nPutting his horse to a more moderate pace, he followed through the\r\n_bosch_, as well as he could.  He expected every moment to hear the\r\nhound bark, the signal that the buck had again stood to bay, but he was\r\ndoomed to disappointment.  No such sound reached his ears.\r\n\r\nHe began to think that the buck was lost, and that, after all the\r\nchances in his favour, he would return to camp with no better story to\r\ntell than his rival.  He was becoming exceedingly chagrined with the\r\nturn things had taken, when, to his further chagrin, he heard a loud\r\nplunge, as of some heavy object falling into deep water.  He knew it was\r\nthe buck.  Another plunge!--that was the dog.\r\n\r\nThere was a river ahead--the antelope had taken to it, and would now\r\nescape to a certainty.  The water seemed near--there was an open tract\r\nthat led in that direction.  Perhaps he might be in time.  Perhaps he\r\nmight get to the bank before the buck could reach the opposite shore.  A\r\nbullet from his rifle might yet secure the game.\r\n\r\nWithout hesitating a moment he again spurred his horse, and galloped\r\ndown the hill in the direction of the water.\r\n\r\nThere _was_ a river, and in a few seconds' time Hendrik was on its bank.\r\nHe had arrived at a place where the water was deep and the current\r\nstill, but the rippling wave on the surface guided him.  Two objects\r\nwere seen above the surface moving rapidly across.  They were the horns\r\nof the buck and the head of the buck-dog!\r\n\r\nHendrik had no time to alight.  Before he could steady his horse, the\r\nblauw-bok had got out of the water, and was climbing up the opposite\r\nbank.  There was just time for a hurried shot.  The broad back of the\r\nantelope offered a fair mark, and the next moment a tuft of the hair\r\nnear the spine, was seen to fly up like a spark, while a red stream\r\nspouted from the spot.  The crack of a rifle explained this phenomenon;\r\nand before its echoes had died away, the antelope came tumbling down the\r\nslope, and lay motionless by the edge of the water.\r\n\r\nThe horns were Hendrik's!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER SEVENTEEN.\r\n\r\nA TOUGH STRUGGLE.\r\n\r\nThe horns were Hendrik's!\r\n\r\nSo thought Hendrik, when, at the crack of his rifle, he saw the buck\r\nroll backward down the bank into the very jaws of the buck-dog.\r\n\r\nHe was mistaken, however--as he had reason to think the moment after--\r\nwhen the antelope, instead of lying still where it had fallen, rose to\r\nits feet again, beat off the dog with its horns, and springing over him,\r\nonce more plunged into the river!  The dog bounded after, and, swimming\r\nfaster than the antelope, overtook it near the middle of the stream,\r\nseizing it by the quarters as he got within reach.  The strong buck soon\r\nshook him off, and turning short upon his persecutor, struck at him in\r\nthe water.  Two or three times the hound was under its horns, but the\r\nwater yielding saved Hendrik's favourite from destruction, although more\r\nthan once he was forced under the surface.\r\n\r\nThis struggle was kept up for some moments.  The river ran red, blood\r\npouring from the wound of the bullet, as well as from the flanks of the\r\nantelope, lacerated by the tusks of his canine assailant.  The blood of\r\nthe hound also helped to colour the current--for the sharp horns of the\r\nbuck had been used to some purpose, and several gashes appeared in the\r\nhide of the dog, from which the crimson flood streamed copiously.\r\n\r\nAfter delivering his fire, Hendrik had alighted, not with the intention\r\nof reloading, but merely to secure his prize, which, as he supposed, had\r\nbeen finished by the shot.  He was about tying his bridle to a branch;\r\nbut, before he had succeeded in making a knot, the renewed struggle on\r\nthe opposite bank, followed by the plunge, caused him suddenly to drop\r\nthe reins and again lay hold of his rifle.\r\n\r\nHe loaded with all haste, and ran forward to the bank.\r\n\r\nThere was a fringing of willow-bushes along the edge of the river.  In\r\nthe saddle Hendrik had been able to look over them, and at that\r\nelevation commanded a view of the water.  Afoot he could not see it,\r\nexcept obscurely through the tops of the willows.  He could only see\r\nthat the water was waving with eddies and covered with frothy bubbles.\r\nHe could hear that a struggle was going on between buck and buck-dog,\r\nbut the combatants had got close in to the willows, and the leaves\r\nprevented Hendrik from seeing either of them.\r\n\r\nAt one place there was a break in the willows, where the bank sloped\r\ndownward to the water's edge.  It was a mere pathway, made by wild\r\nanimals in going to drink.  On both sides of it the bushes grew thick,\r\nforming a narrow lane or alley.\r\n\r\nHendrik's eye fell upon this path, and the next moment he was hastening\r\ndown it.  The antelope from the river had also noted the path.  It was\r\nthe place easiest of access from the water, as there the bank was more\r\nshelving than at any other point; and just at the time the hunter rushed\r\ninto it from the woods, the buck was entering its opposite end from the\r\nwater!\r\n\r\nBoth were going at full speed, and in five seconds' time they met face\r\nto face in the narrow pathway!\r\n\r\nThere was no chance for either to make way for the other.  The close\r\nthicket on each side prevented that.  There was no chance for either to\r\nretreat; the impetuosity with which they were running rendered it\r\nimpossible for either to give back or even halt.  They must meet with a\r\nfearful collision!\r\n\r\nSuch a meeting would be entirely to the advantage of the buck, and,\r\nperhaps, to the total destruction of the hunter.\r\n\r\nHendrik saw this, and would have aimed at the buck and fired had time\r\nbeen allowed him.  But so sudden and unexpected was the encounter that\r\nhe had not even time to get his rifle to the level, before the animal\r\nwas too near to admit of such delay.\r\n\r\nHe fired wildly without taking aim.  The bullet scored the back of the\r\nantelope, only to add to its fury; and with head lowered and scimitars\r\nset, it rushed onward upon the hunter.\r\n\r\nIt was a moment of peril for Hendrik.  Another moment, and he would have\r\nbeen impaled upon the sharp horns; but at that instant, as if guided by\r\nan impulse of instinct, he dropped his rifle, and ran forward towards\r\nthe buck, as if to fling himself upon its horns!\r\n\r\nThat was far from being his intention, however.  When within about three\r\nfeet of these horns, he gave a sudden bound and rose like a springbok\r\ninto the air!\r\n\r\nThat spring saved him.  Before he came down again the horns had passed\r\nunder him, and he fell heavily across the back of the buck.\r\n\r\nThe hind-quarters of the antelope sank under his weight, and Hendrik\r\nslipped off; but before he could recover his feet, the furious animal\r\nhad turned, and was again springing upon him where he lay.\r\n\r\nIt would have been all up with Hendrik, had he been left to himself at\r\nthat moment.  But succour was nigh.\r\n\r\nThe buck-dog had reached the spot; and just as the antelope was making\r\nhis rush, the dog sprang forward, and, seizing it by the throat, hung\r\nfast.\r\n\r\nHendrik received the blow, but the weight of the dog hanging to the\r\nthroat of the antelope prevented the latter from giving it with effect,\r\nand the hunter was but slightly injured.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the buck kicked the dog off with its hoofs, and flung him\r\nto the ground.  In another instant it would have finished him with its\r\nhorns; but Hendrik, from the sharp blow he had received, was now as\r\nangry as the antelope itself, and was not going to see his favourite\r\nhound killed before his eyes without making an effort to save him.\r\nWarmed to the conflict, he thought no longer of retreating; and, drawing\r\nhis hunting-knife, he sprang forward upon the antelope, that, engaged\r\nwith the dog, chanced to stand broadside towards him.  With his left\r\nhand the hunter grasped one of the horns near its tip; and, using this\r\nas a fulcrum, he turned round upon it, and thrust the long blade between\r\nthe ribs of the buck!\r\n\r\nIt was a home-thrust--for the animal fell dead at Hendrik's feet before\r\nhe could let go his hold upon the horn.  The blade had passed through\r\nits heart.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Hendrik had cooled a little from the conflict, he thought of\r\nGroot Willem, who had not yet come up.  He began to fear that the latter\r\nmight have received some serious injury, and he determined to ride back\r\nto the spot, letting the buck lie where it had fallen.  He could return\r\nfor it afterwards.  Fortunately his own well-trained horse had not run\r\noff--though left with trailing bridle--and Hendrik was soon mounted and\r\nriding back on the spoor of the chase.\r\n\r\nThere was one thing that mystified Hendrik not a little.  While battling\r\nwith the buck he had heard the loud report of Groot Willem's roer.  What\r\ncould he have fired at?  Had any of the other antelopes come in his way?\r\nor was it a signal of distress?  Hendrik was mystified and felt some\r\napprehension.\r\n\r\nHe had not far to go to satisfy himself.  On reaching the edge of the\r\ntimber, he saw Groot Willem mounted and about starting forward to rejoin\r\nhim.  This was a joyful sight to Hendrik, as the fact that Groot Willem\r\nwas once more in the saddle and the \"Camel\" upon his legs again, was\r\ngood _prima facie_ evidence that neither had sustained any very serious\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nNor had they, as Hendrik ascertained by riding up to the spot.  Groot\r\nWillem was not so badly hurt as Hendrik himself, for the latter had one\r\nof his arms well scored by the horns of the buck.  Groot Willem's\r\ntemper, however, was severely ruffled; and though Hendrik was very much\r\ninclined to laugh at the accident, he forbore doing so, out of regard\r\nfor his friend's feelings.\r\n\r\nHendrik now inquired about the report he had heard.\r\n\r\nWas it the roer?  Groot Willem answered his question in the affirmative,\r\nby a simple nod, at the same time pointing to an odd-looking animal that\r\nlay dead upon the ground, with all the appearance of having been freshly\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nHendrik rode forward, and, bending down in his saddle, for some moments\r\nregarded the animal.\r\n\r\nA rare and singular creature it was.  It was about the size of a large\r\nterrier, but shaped very differently.  It had the drooping hind-quarters\r\nthat distinguish the hyenas, and altogether the look of these animals;\r\nbut its muzzle was much more slender and pointed, its back more rounded,\r\nand its limbs not so stout as those of the hyena's.  It was a more\r\nagreeable creature to look upon, and although its hair was long, it had\r\na soft woolly appearance.  The general colour of the hair was grey with\r\na reddish tinge, and with black bands running transversely to the body\r\nof the animal.  This as much as anything else caused it to resemble the\r\nhyena--that is, the species known as the \"striped hyena,\" (_Hyena\r\nstriata_).\r\n\r\nIt was not a hyena, however, but one of those odd animals that seem to\r\nbelong to no class of creatures, but form a connecting link between\r\nseveral.  South Africa is especially prolific in such eccentric forms,\r\nboth among its birds and quadrupeds.  As an illustration of this, we\r\nmight mention the wild-hound, the hyrax, the zerda, the fennec, the\r\ngnoo, and the aard-vark; and among birds, the serpent-eater, the\r\nbateleur eagle, and several other kinds.  Most of these odd animals are\r\nonly represented by a single species, and that only to be found in South\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nNow the creature that lay stretched out before the eyes of Hendrik was\r\njust one of these zoological puzzles, that has occupied the attention of\r\nthe systematists for a long while.  Some have classed it among dogs,\r\nothers with hyenas, some make a civet of it, and others a fox.  With all\r\nthese animals it has affinities, both in habits and anatomical\r\nstructure, but it is not near enough to any to be regarded either as\r\ndog, fox, civet, or hyena; and hence a genus has been created for\r\nitself--the genus _Proteles_.  It was a _proteles_ that lay upon the\r\nground--_Proteles Delalandii_,--so called from its first describer, the\r\ntraveller De Lalande.\r\n\r\nHendrik and Groot Willem knew the animal by the name of \"aard-wolf,\" or\r\nearth-wolf, so called because it lives underground in a burrow of its\r\nown making.  They knew it well enough, for it is common through all\r\nSouth Africa--even in the settled districts, though on account of its\r\nnocturnal and burrowing habits it is not often seen.  It makes itself\r\nknown to the boor by its evil propensities; and although he may rarely\r\nget his eyes upon it, as it is never abroad by day, he is often called\r\nupon to witness the dire effects of its midnight marauding.\r\n\r\nThe sheep of South Africa are of a singular breed--singular on account\r\nof their large fleshy tails, consisting of a mass of almost pure fat\r\nwhich often weighs several pounds, and is used by the colonial\r\nhousewives in many operations of cookery.  Now these tails, hanging to\r\nthe ground are the favourite _bonne-bouche_ of the aard-wolf, whose\r\njaws, not strong like those of the hyena, compel him to feed upon soft\r\nsubstances.  It is, therefore, no uncommon thing for the vee-boor to get\r\nup in the morning, and find several of his best sheep divested of their\r\nvaluable tails, and all through the voracity of the aard-vark.\r\n\r\nIt was not likely that either Groot Willem or Hendrik was ignorant of\r\nthe aard-vark.  Neither were they.  Hendrik did not ride up to examine\r\nthe animal out of curiosity.  He had seen such before, and killed them\r\ntoo.  His object in bending over it was to see where Groot Willem's\r\nbullet had hit.\r\n\r\n\"Where had the creature come from?\" he inquired.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem replied that it had issued from its burrow--the hole that\r\nhad caused the \"Camel\" to stumble.  That it had come out, just as he,\r\nGroot Willem, recovered his feet; and that, provoked at it for having\r\nbeen the cause of his misfortune, he had sent a bullet through it,\r\notherwise he would not have reckoned it worth his powder and lead.\r\n\r\nThis explained the report of the roer.\r\n\r\nHendrik and Groot Willem were now about to return for the buck, with the\r\nintention of carrying as much of the meat to camp as they could manage\r\nupon their horses; when Hans and Arend came up, and the four rode off\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThey quartered the antelope, and each having packed a quarter upon his\r\ncroup, they set out for the camp.\r\n\r\nAll of them were in good spirits, except perhaps Groot Willem, who had\r\ntwo reasons for feeling out of sorts,--the loss of his dog, and the loss\r\nof a little of his hunter-fame.  And he was not permitted to forget his\r\naccident so easily, for although Hendrik had forborne to give him\r\nfurther chagrin, yet Hans and Arend did not deal so delicately with him,\r\nbut both laughed heartily at his unfortunate tumble.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER EIGHTEEN.\r\n\r\nTHE ARROW-POISON.\r\n\r\nKlaas and Jan had long since ridden their ponies back to camp, and\r\nhaving off-saddled, remained by the wagons.\r\n\r\nFor all that they were not idle--that is, they were not without\r\nsomething to interest and amuse them.  Swartboy was the genius\r\nworshipped by Klaas and Jan, for there was no bird in all Africa that\r\nSwartboy could not either snare or trap; and in his hours of leisure,\r\nwhen the oxen were kraaled and off his hands, he was in the habit of\r\nshowing the two young \"mynheers\" how to construct many a sort of decoy\r\nand trap for the fowls of the air.\r\n\r\nUpon this day in particular, however, they were more than usually\r\ninterested in the Bushman's proceedings, as his attention was turned to\r\ncapturing,--not a fowl of the air, but of the earth,--an ostrich.\r\n\r\nSwartboy had resolved to pluck the plumes out of the old cock that had\r\nbeen seen, and whose dwelling had been so rudely approached and\r\nplundered in the morning.\r\n\r\nBut how was Swartboy to capture the cock?\r\n\r\nIt was not his intention to take him alive.  That is a difficult matter,\r\nand can only be managed by men mounted upon fleet horses, and then after\r\na very long and troublesome chase.\r\n\r\nSwartboy had no wish to take the ostrich alive.  The bird would be of no\r\nuse to him in that way, as the skin and plume-feathers were the spoils\r\nupon which the Bushman's thoughts were bent, or rather the rix-dollars\r\nwhich these would yield on Swartboy's return to Graaf Reinet.  Therefore\r\nhe did not intend to _catch_ the old cock, but _kill_ him, if he could.\r\n\r\nBut how was the Bushman to accomplish this?  Would he borrow the rifle\r\nfrom Hendrik, or the great elephant-gun--the \"roer\"--from Groot Willem,\r\nand shoot the ostrich?  Not likely.  Swartboy was no shot, that is, with\r\nfire-arms.  He knew nothing about them; and with either rifle or roer he\r\ncould scarcely have hit an elephant, much less an ostrich!\r\n\r\nBut if Swartboy knew not how to manage a gun, he had a weapon of his own\r\nthat he did know how to manage,--his bow.  With that tiny bow,--scarce a\r\nyard in length,--and those small slender arrows, the Bushman could send\r\na missile as deadly as the leaden bullet of either rifle or roer.\r\n\r\nLooking at the light reed, with its little barbed head and feathered\r\nshaft, you would scarcely believe it possible that such a weapon could\r\nbring down the big strong ostrich; and yet with a similar shaft had\r\nSwartboy often levelled the great camelopard in the dust.  A deadly and\r\ndangerous weapon was the Bushman's arrow.\r\n\r\nBut what rendered it so?  Not its size, and surely not the force with\r\nwhich it could be projected from that tiny bow?  Neither.  There was\r\nsomething besides the strength of the bow and the weight of the arrow to\r\nmake it a \"deadly and dangerous weapon.\"  There was _poison_.\r\n\r\nSwartboy's arrows were true Bushman weapons,--they were poisoned.  No\r\nwonder they were deadly.\r\n\r\nThe use of the bow among savage nations all over the earth, and the\r\ngreat similarity of its form and construction everywhere, may be\r\nregarded as one of the most curious facts in the history of our race.\r\nTribes and nations that appear to have been isolated beyond all possible\r\ncommunication with the rest of the world, are found in possession of\r\nthis universal weapon, constructed on the same principle, and only\r\ndiffering slightly in details--these details usually having reference to\r\nsurrounding circumstances.  When all else between two tribes or nations\r\nof savages may differ, both will be found carrying a common instrument\r\nof destruction,--the bow and arrows.\r\n\r\nCan it be mere coincidence, like necessities in different parts of the\r\nworld producing like results, or is this possession of a similar weapon\r\namong distant and remote peoples a proof of unity or communication\r\nbetween them in early times?\r\n\r\nThese inquiries would lead to a long train of reflections, which,\r\nhowever interesting, would here be out of place.\r\n\r\nBut an equally or still more curious fact is that of _poisoned_ arrows.\r\nWe find here and there, in almost every quarter of the globe, tribes of\r\nsavages who poison their arrows; and the mode of preparing and using\r\nthis poison is almost exactly the same among all of them.  Where there\r\nis a difference, it arises from the different circumstances by which the\r\ntribe may be surrounded.\r\n\r\nNow the knowledge of arrow-poison, as well as the mode of preparing it\r\nand the habit of using it, belong to tribes of savages so completely\r\nisolated, that it is not probable--hardly possible, in fact--that either\r\nthey or their ancestors could ever have communicated it to one another.\r\nWe cannot believe that there ever existed intercourse between the\r\nBushman of Africa and the Chuncho of the Amazon, much less between the\r\nformer and the forest tribes of North America; yet all these use the\r\narrow-poison and prepare it in a similar manner!  All make it by a\r\nmixture of vegetable poison with the subtle fluid extracted from the\r\nfang-glands of venomous serpents.  In North America, the rattlesnake and\r\nmoccason, with several species of roots, furnish the material; in South\r\nAmerica, the \"wourali,\" or \"curare,\" as it is indifferently called, is a\r\nmixture of a vegetable juice with the poison extracted from the glands\r\nof the coral-snake, (_Echidna ocellata_), the \"boiquira\" or \"diamond\r\nrattlesnake,\" (_Crotalus horridus_), the lance-headed \"viper,\"\r\n(_Trigonocephalus lanceolate_) the formidable \"bushmaster,\" (_Lachesis\r\nrhombeata_), and several other species.  In South Africa, a similar\r\nresult is obtained by mixing the fluid from the poison-glands of the\r\npuff-adder, or that of various species of _naja_, the \"cobras\" of that\r\ncountry, with the juice from the root of an Amaryllis, called _gift-bol_\r\n(poison-bulb) in the phraseology of the colonial Dutch.  It is out of\r\nsuch elements that the Bushman mixes his dangerous compound.\r\n\r\nNow our Bushman, Swartboy, understood the process as well as any of his\r\nrace; and it was in watching him mixing the ingredients and poisoning\r\nhis arrows that Klaas and Jan spent the early portion of that day.\r\n\r\nAll the ingredients he carried with him; for whenever a \"geel coppel,\"\r\n(_Naja haje_), or a \"spuugh-slang,\" (_Naja nigra_), or the \"puff-adder,\"\r\n(_Vipera arretans_), or the horned viper, (_Cerastes caudalis_,)--\r\nwhenever any of these was killed on the route--and many were--Swartboy\r\ntook care to open the poison-gland, situated behind their fangs, and\r\ntake therefrom the drop of venom, which he carefully preserved in a\r\nsmall phial.  He also carried another ingredient, a species of bitumen\r\nobtained from certain caverns, where it exudes from the rocks.  The\r\nobject of this is not, as supposed by some travellers, to render the\r\ncharm \"more potent,\" but simply to make it glutinous, so that it would\r\nstick securely to the barb of the arrow, and not brush off too easily.\r\nA similar result is obtained by the South American Indians from a\r\nvegetable gum.\r\n\r\nThe gift-bol, or poison-bulb, was easily obtained, as the species of\r\nAmaryllis that yields it grew plentifully near.  But Swartboy had not\r\ntrusted to this chance, as during past days he had plucked several of\r\nthe roots, and put them away in one of the side-chests of the wagon,\r\nwhere many other little knick-knacks of his lay snugly stowed.\r\n\r\nKlaas and Jan, therefore, had the rare chance of witnessing the\r\nmanufacture of the celebrated arrow-poison.\r\n\r\nThey saw Swartboy bruise the gift-bol, and simmer it over the fire in a\r\nsmall tin pan which he had; they saw him drop in the precious\r\nsnake-venom; they saw him stir it round, until it became of a very dark\r\ncolour, and then, to their great astonishment, they saw him try its\r\nstrength _by tasting_!\r\n\r\nThis seemed odd to both, and so may it to you, boy reader,--that a drop\r\nof poison, the smallest portion of which would have killed Swartboy as\r\ndead as a herring, could be thus swallowed by him with impunity!  But\r\nyou are to remember that poisons, both vegetable and mineral, are very\r\ndifferent in their nature.  A small quantity of arsenic taken into the\r\nstomach will produce death, and yet you might swallow the head of a\r\nrattlesnake, fangs, poison-gland, and all, without the slightest danger.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, if a single grain of the latter were to enter your\r\nblood, even if it were only scratched in with a pin, its effects would\r\nbe fatal, while other poisons may be introduced into the blood without\r\nany fatal result.\r\n\r\nSwartboy knew there was no arsenic or any species of \"stomach-poison,\"\r\nif I am allowed to use such a phrase, in his mixture.  It was only\r\n\"blood-poison,\" which he might _taste_ with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe bitumen was the last thing put into the pan; and when Swartboy had\r\nstirred it a while longer, and sufficiently thickened it, so that it\r\nwould adhere to the barbs, he took down a quiver of arrows already made,\r\nand dipped each of them into the poison.  As soon as the barbs had\r\ncooled, and the poison became well dried, the arrows were ready for use,\r\nand Swartboy intended that some of them should be used on that very day.\r\nBefore the sun should set, he designed sending one or more of them\r\nthrough the skin of an ostrich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER NINETEEN.\r\n\r\nDECOYING THE OLD COCK.\r\n\r\nIt was not the process of mixing the arrow-poison, so much as the use to\r\nbe made of it, that interested Klaas and Jan.  They knew that the\r\nBushman intended to try its effect on an ostrich that afternoon.  More\r\nthan that, Swartboy had promised they should actually see how he managed\r\nmatters, and witness the death of the ostrich.  With such a prospect\r\nbefore them, the boys were in high spirits all the fore-part of the day.\r\n\r\nIt was to be late in the afternoon, near sunset, in fact, before the\r\nsport should come off.  Of course not till the return of the ostriches\r\nto their nest--for it was there the drama was to be enacted.  The nest\r\nand its environs were to be the scene of the tragedy--the time a little\r\nbefore sunset.  Such was Swartboy's \"programme.\"\r\n\r\nOf course Swartboy had leave from the older boys to go upon almost\r\nwhatever expedition he pleased, but certainly upon this one, since Klaas\r\nand Jan were so interested about it.  Indeed, some of the others would\r\nhave liked to take part in the affair, but for certain reasons that\r\ncould not be.\r\n\r\nSome of the hunters had doubts as to the result.  They knew the poisoned\r\narrow would kill any ostrich.  They did not doubt that.  But how was\r\nSwartboy to get near enough to discharge one of his tiny shafts into the\r\nbird's body?  That was the question that puzzled them.  He proposed\r\ndoing so in broad daylight.  Indeed there was no other time for him.\r\nAll knew that before night the ostriches would return to their nest--as\r\nsoon as the sun was low, and it became cooler,--but they knew also that\r\nthe birds having found out what had happened in their absence would\r\nstart off in alarm, and abandon the nest altogether.\r\n\r\nSwartboy, therefore, would have no darkness to shelter him from their\r\ngaze.  How was he to approach them within the range required for his\r\nsmall bow--that is, within less than fifty yards?\r\n\r\nDid he intend to place himself in ambush and wait for their return?  If\r\nhe did, it must be near the nest, else he would have but a poor chance.\r\nThere was no knowing in what direction the birds might come back, or\r\nwhich way they would scamper off again.\r\n\r\nNow for Swartboy to conceal himself near the nest, all believed to be an\r\nimpossibility.  There was not a bit of cover within five hundred yards\r\nof the spot--neither bush nor stone big enough to conceal the body of a\r\nman from creatures less wary than ostriches, but from these a cat could\r\nnot have hidden her carcass within a circle of a thousand yards\r\ndiameter.  As to Swartboy's sinking a \"shooting-hole\" and lying await in\r\nthat, the boys never thought of such a thing.  A shooting-hole\r\nsurrounded by bushes might do for a lion, or a rhinoceros, or an\r\nelephant, but no ostrich could be bamboozled by any such _ruse_; for\r\nthese birds--that on account of their appearance have been called stupid\r\nby some superficial observers--are in reality the very reverse.  The\r\nslightest alteration in the form of the ground, either around their\r\nnests or near it, would be noted by them, and would prevent them from\r\napproaching it, except after such a reconnoissance as would defeat all\r\nSwartboy's plans.  But he had no thought of a shooting-hole--nothing of\r\nthe sort.\r\n\r\nWhat plan, then, had he in his mind?  The boys could not guess; and\r\nSwartboy, like all cunning hunters, did not care to tell his plans to\r\neverybody.  He preferred letting them discover them by his acts; and as\r\nall of them were hunters themselves and boys of good breeding, they did\r\nnot persecute him with idle questions, but watched his preparations in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nNow one of his preparations, made before starting, was to take the\r\nlittle fennec that had been killed in the morning, and \"truss\" it with a\r\nnumber of skewers, in such a way that it stood upright upon its legs,\r\nand at a short distance looked as if it was \"alive and well!\"\r\n\r\nThis was Swartboy's last act, before setting out for the ostriches'\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nWhen it was finished, Swartboy observed that the sun was low enough, and\r\ntaking the fennec under his army and his bow in his hand, he struck off\r\nover the plain.\r\n\r\nThe boys were to be spectators of the affair, but that was rather in a\r\nfigurative sense.  There were two pocket telescopes, and when Swartboy\r\npromised that Klaas and Jan should be witnesses of the thing, he had\r\nthese telescopes in his mind.  For certain reasons he could not take any\r\nof the boys along with him, and from the wary character of the game they\r\ncould not go near enough to observe it with the naked eye.  To have done\r\nso would have driven the ostriches out of Swartboy's reach, for it has\r\nbeen already stated that these far-seeing birds can sight an enemy\r\nfarther off than they can themselves be seen.\r\n\r\nThe telescopes, therefore, must be brought into play, and as Klaas and\r\nJan begged to have the use of them, it was arranged that the two boys\r\nshould climb into a tree, and describe what they saw to the rest, who\r\nstood below.  That would be witnessing a spectacle by a sort of _second\r\nsight_, as Arend jocosely remarked.\r\n\r\nKlaas and Jan were therefore hoisted up into a camel-thorn acacia; and,\r\nseating themselves on its branches, prepared their telescopes for use.\r\n\r\nThe elevation enabled them not only to see the nest, for that was\r\nvisible from the ground, but the surface of the plain to a considerable\r\ndistance beyond.  They would thus be enabled to note every movement\r\neither Swartboy or the ostriches should make.\r\n\r\nNow it has been stated that within a circle of five hundred yards radius\r\nfrom the nest, there was no cover that would have concealed a cat.  With\r\nthe exception of a stone here and there--none of them larger than a\r\nquartern loaf--the sandy surface was perfectly smooth and level as a\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThe boys had noticed this in the morning.  Hendrik and Groot Willem had\r\ntaken good notice of it, for they, as well as Swartboy, had thought of\r\n\"waylaying\" the ostriches on their return, but had given up the idea,\r\nfrom the fact of there being no cover to conceal them from the eyes of\r\nthe wary birds.\r\n\r\nBut just outside the circumference mentioned, there was a chance of\r\ncover--a bush that by tight squeezing might have sheltered the body of a\r\nman.  Both Hendrik and Groot Willem had seen this bush, but on account\r\nof its great distance from the nest they had never thought of its being\r\nused as a cover.  Five hundred yards off,--it might as well have been\r\nfive miles.  Even had it been on the side by which the ostriches had\r\ngone off, and by which they, the hunters, conjectured they would return,\r\nthe bush might have served.  A shot might have been obtained as the\r\nbirds came back to the nest.  But it was not on that side,--on the very\r\nopposite--and in the direction of the camp.  Neither Hendrik nor Groot\r\nWillem had entertained the idea of lying behind it.\r\n\r\nSwartboy had; and to this bush now repaired Swartboy as straight as he\r\ncould go.  For what purpose?  To conceal himself behind it, and wait for\r\nthe ostriches.  That was his design.\r\n\r\nBut what would his arrows avail--poisoned as they were--at the distance\r\nof five hundred yards?  Ah!  Swartboy knew what he was about.  Let us\r\nrecord his movements in the words of Klaas and Jan, who watched them\r\nnarrowly.\r\n\r\n\"Swartboy has reached the bush,\" reported Jan; \"he lays down his bow and\r\narrows beside it.  Now he has gone away from it.  He is proceeding in a\r\nstraight line towards the nest.  He has the fox with him.  See! he stops\r\nagain,--a little beyond the bush he has halted--between it and the nest,\r\nbut nearer the bush.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very near the bush,\" said Klaas; \"not twenty yards from it, I'm sure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what does he do there?\" demanded Hendrik.  \"He appears to be\r\nstooping?\"\r\n\r\n\"He is stooping,\" replied Jan.  \"Let me see!  He's got the fox in his\r\nhands, he is placing it on the ground!  He has left it!  I declare, it\r\nis standing by itself, as if it were alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very clear what he intends by that,\" said Hans; \"I can understand\r\nnow how he means to get the birds within range.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I!\" rejoined Hendrik.\r\n\r\n\"And I!\" echoed Groot Willem.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued Jan, \"he's going on to the nest--he has reached it, and\r\nis walking round and round, and stooping and kicking with his feet.  I\r\ncan't tell what he's about--can you, Klaas?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" replied Klaas, \"he's trying to cover up the broken shells we\r\nleft there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! that's exactly it!\" said Jan.  \"See! he's stooping over the nest,\r\nhe has lifted an egg in his hand!\"\r\n\r\nIt is to be remembered that only the fresh eggs were brought away in the\r\nmorning.  Those in the nest that had undergone hatching were of course\r\nlet alone--all except one or two, that had been broken to \"try\" them.\r\n\r\n\"He's coming back this way,\" said Jan.  \"He has the egg in his hand!\r\nNow he has put it down right under the snout of the fox!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" ejaculated Hans, Groot Willem, and Hendrik, \"how cunning of old\r\nSwart!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued Jan, \"he's back to the bush: and now he's squatted down\r\nbehind it.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a little while both Klaas and Jan announced that Swartboy was\r\nmaking no further movements, but continued to lie quietly.\r\n\r\nNow the secret of Swartboy's strategy lay in his knowledge of a fact in\r\nnatural history,--a knowledge of the antipathy that exists between the\r\nostrich and the egg-eating fox.  Swartboy's experience had taught him\r\nthe habits of the fennec, and also the hostile feeling of the ostrich\r\ntowards this enemy.  So strong is this feeling on the part of the bird,\r\nthat whenever it sets its eye upon one of these creatures it will run\r\ndirectly towards it, for the purpose of destroying it.  On such\r\noccasions the speed of the quadruped will not save it.  Unless its\r\nburrow be nigh, or some thick bush or cleft among the rocks offer it a\r\nshelter, a single kick from the legs of the mighty bird at once puts an\r\nend to its prowling existence.\r\n\r\nSwartboy knew all this, and for that reason had he set his decoy.\r\nConspicuously placed, the birds would be sure to see it; and with their\r\nnest half plundered, and one of the eggs still under its very nose, they\r\nwould not be slow in coming up to take revenge upon the poor fennec, the\r\nsupposed robber, and to them well-known burglar.\r\n\r\n\"The ostriches are coming!\" cried the sharp-sighted Jan, after a long\r\npause.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" asked Klaas.  \"I don't see them yet;--where, Jan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yonder,\" replied Jan.  \"Beyond the nest,--far off.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, now I see!\" said Klaas; \"just the way they went off in the morning;\r\nthree of them,--a cock and two hens,--they are the same, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now they are getting up near the nest,\" reported Jan; \"now they are up\r\nto it.  See them!  What are they doing? they are running about in a\r\nterrible way.  See! their heads move up and down,--they are striking\r\nwith their legs.  What are they about?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" rejoined Klaas,--\"I declare I think they are _breaking the\r\neggs_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a doubt of it,\" remarked Hans.  \"That is always their way when they\r\nreturn and find the nest disturbed either by a human being or an animal.\r\nNo doubt that is what they are at.\"\r\n\r\nHendrik and Groot Willem confirmed this statement by their assent.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" exclaimed Jan, \"they have left the nest,--they are coming this\r\nway,--they are coming towards Swartboy,--how fast they run!  Hey--they\r\nare upon the fennec!  Ho! they have kicked it over!  See, they are\r\npecking it with their bills and knocking it about like a foot-ball.\r\nHurrah! such a jolly game as is going on yonder!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is old Swart doing, anyhow?  They're near enough for a shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's doing something,\" answered Klaas.  \"I'm sure I saw him move.  Did\r\nhe not draw his bow yonder?\"\r\n\r\n\"He did,\" replied Jan; \"he has let off an arrow.  I saw his arms move\r\nsuddenly.  See, the ostriches are off again.  Ho! they are quite gone!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not so, however; for, although the three ran off on hearing the\r\ntwang of the Bushman's bow, they did not run far.  After going some\r\nquarter of a mile or so, the cock began to droop his wings and run round\r\nin circles, the hens all the while following.  His movements now became\r\nof a very eccentric kind, and it was plain that Swartboy's arrow had\r\npierced him, and the poison was doing its work.  The bird reeled like a\r\ndrunken man, once or twice fell to its knees, rose again, ran on a piece\r\nfarther, flapping its wings, and vibrating its long neck from side to\r\nside; and then, staggering forward, fell upon the plain!\r\n\r\nFor several minutes it continued to flutter, kicking out with its strong\r\nlimbs, and raising the dust as if it had been a buffalo.  At length its\r\nstruggles ceased, and it lay motionless upon the sand.\r\n\r\nThe two hens still continued near, and from their actions were evidently\r\nboth surprised and alarmed.  They did not, however, attempt to run off,\r\nuntil Swartboy, knowing they were far beyond the reach of his bow, rose\r\nup from his ambush, and walked towards them.  Then both took to their\r\nheels, and scouring off over the plain, were soon out of sight.  Klaas\r\nand Jan now reported that Swartboy was stooping over the dead cock, and,\r\nas they believed, skinning him.\r\n\r\nThat was exactly what Swartboy was doing, for, about an hour after, he\r\ncame into camp carrying the skin upon his shoulders, and with an air of\r\ntriumph, that plainly said--\r\n\r\n\"Congo, could you do that?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY.\r\n\r\nA BRUSH WITH THE BRINDLED GNOO.\r\n\r\nThe young yagers resolved to stay a couple of days longer by the\r\nfountain in the mokhala grove.  Their object was to wait until the flesh\r\nof the blue-buck--which is excellent eating--should be reduced to\r\nbiltong.  They did not know what chance of game there might be upon\r\ntheir route for the next five or six days.  The way was new to all of\r\nthem--even to the guide Congo, who had only a general knowledge of that\r\npart of the country.  They were heading for the Molopo River, and Congo\r\nknew how to find that well enough; but their route through the\r\ninterlying country he knew nothing about.  There might be plenty of\r\ngame--there might be a great scarcity of it--he could not tell.\r\n\r\nOf course neither could Swartboy.  The hunters were now out of the\r\nBushman country and into a territory inhabited by poor tribes of the\r\ngreat Bechuana family.  Swartboy's native district lay to the southwest,\r\nin the direction of Namaqualand.  He had never been so far east in his\r\nlife, and of course was quite a stranger to the route they were\r\npursuing.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances Hans, who from his age and superior wisdom was\r\nlooked upon as a sort of leader, recommended that they should not go\r\nforward until they had properly jerked the flesh of the blue-buck.\r\n\r\nThat, with what remained of the gemsbok, would secure them against\r\nfalling short of provision, should game prove scarce.  They would only\r\nhave to tarry a couple of days longer.  That would be sufficient under\r\nsuch a strong sun to dry the biltong properly, whereas if packed without\r\nbeing well cured, the hot weather would spoil it directly, and they\r\nmight be left in the lurch without a morsel of meat.\r\n\r\nTheir stay at their present camp was, therefore, prolonged for two days,\r\nduring which time the flesh of the blue-buck, with the remaining parts\r\nof that of the oryx, hanging in red festoons from the branches of the\r\nacacias, became dark, stiff, and hard to the touch, and was then in a\r\ncondition to keep for several weeks if required.\r\n\r\nBut the young yagers did not remain constantly by the camp during all\r\nthe intervening time.  The biltong required no watching.  It had been\r\nhung upon branches, sufficiently high to place it beyond the reach of\r\nprowling jackals and hyenas at night, and during the day there was\r\nalways some one by the camp to keep off the vultures.\r\n\r\nOn the first of these two days the young yagers mounted, all six, and\r\nrode off to the grassy plains, where they had hunted the blue-buck, in\r\nhopes of falling in either with this or some other species of antelope.\r\n\r\nThey were not disappointed.  On arriving at the plain, they perceived\r\nthat it was occupied--not by one, but by several kinds of creatures.\r\nThree species of animals were seen upon it.  Far out was a herd of small\r\ncreatures, whose lyre-shaped horns, and yellow dun bodies, told that\r\nthey were springboks,--a fact made plain by their strange behaviour,--by\r\nindividuals of the herd now and then bounding up into the air, and\r\nthrowing open the marsupial folding of skin over their croups, and\r\ndisplaying the long snow-white hair that lines that singular pouch.\r\n\r\nNot far from these, and occasionally mixing among them, was a drove of\r\nlarger animals, whose singular colour and markings could not be\r\nmistaken.  They were _dauws_, or, in the clumsy language of the closet\r\nnaturalists, \"Burchell's zebras,\" (_Equus Burchellii_).  It has been\r\nalready stated that this species differs from the true zebra in several\r\nrespects.  Its ground colour is light sienna, while that of the zebra is\r\nnearly white.  The stripes upon the former are dark brown, while those\r\nof the latter are pure black; but the most characteristic difference in\r\nthe markings is, that in the true zebra the stripes continue in rings\r\ndown the legs to the very hoofs, while in the dauw the legs are white.\r\nThe ears and tail of the zebra are more asinine than those of the dauw,\r\nwhile the tail of the latter is much the longer, as indeed is the body\r\nof the animal.\r\n\r\nBoth are beautiful creatures--perhaps the most beautiful quadrupeds in\r\nthe world--a fine horse always excepted.  But in point of beauty the\r\ntrue zebra certainly excels the \"Burchell.\"  They are very different in\r\ntheir habits--the zebra being a mountain-dwelling animal, while the dauw\r\nis strictly a denizen of the open plains, in places similar to those\r\nfrequented by the quagga.  Although it never herds with the latter, in\r\nhabits it resembles their species more than it does the zebra.\r\nObservation of this fact by the boor hunters has led to the name among\r\nthese people of \"bonte quagga,\" (painted quagga.)\r\n\r\nThe third kind of animals upon the plain was a very remarkable species;\r\nso odd in form and movements were they, that no one who had once seen\r\neither them, or a picture of them, could afterwards fail to recognise\r\nthem.  The young yagers had never set eyes upon them before, but they\r\nhad all seen a kindred species, which, except in colour and a few minor\r\ndetails, is very like them.  They had all seen the \"wildebeest\"\r\nor \"gnoo,\" and this enabled them at once to recognise the\r\n\"blauw-wildebeest,\" or \"brindled gnoo,\" for such they were.\r\n\r\nThey differ from the common wildebeest in being larger, somewhat heavier\r\nin form, scarcely so well shaped about the head and neck--the latter not\r\ncurving as in the common species--more shaggy in the mane, the\r\nnose-tuft, and the long hair on the throat and breast.  In colour they\r\nare quite different, being of a dirty bluish tint, variegated with\r\nirregular stripes, or \"brindles.\"  Hence their trivial names of \"blauw\"\r\nwildebeest and \"brindled\" gnoo.\r\n\r\nThe two kinds, \"gnoo\" and \"brindled gnoo,\" are never found on the same\r\nplains; but give place to each other.  The range of the latter species\r\nextends farthest to the north.  They are scarcely ever found alone, but\r\ngenerally accompanied by droves of the dauw; (Burchell's zebra or bonte\r\nquagga); and, what is a singular fact, the common species is rarely\r\nseen, except in company with the common quagga.  Although neither of\r\nthese keep company with their own congeners they yet live socially with\r\none another, both also herding at times with springboks, hartebeests,\r\nand ostriches.  A singular and interesting sight it is to see the gnoos,\r\nantelopes, and wild asses, curveting and galloping over the plain, now\r\nwheeling in circles, now halting in line, anon charging from point to\r\npoint, like troops of cavalry in a review, while the ostriches stalk\r\nabout or stand motionless, their tall forms rising high above the rest,\r\nas if they were the officers and generals-in-chief of the spectacle!\r\nSuch a picture is often presented upon the karoo plains of Southern\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the young yagers came in sight of the plain, they pulled up\r\ntheir horses, and sat for some moments regarding the lively scene that\r\nwas exhibited upon its surface.  The springboks were browsing, though\r\nsome individuals were constantly in the air bounding up as if for their\r\nown amusement.  The dauws were trooping about, sometimes halting, and\r\nsometimes galloping from point to point, as if in play or alarmed by\r\nsome intruder.  The brindled gnoos, that is the cows, were browsing in a\r\nherd of thirty or forty in number, while the bulls stood around in small\r\ngroups of three or four individuals, not moving, but apparently keeping\r\na solemn watch over the others, every now and then snorting loudly, and\r\nuttering a sharp and peculiar cry, as if intended for some voice of\r\nwarning or instruction.  For hours the old bulls will hold this\r\nposition, keeping apart from the rest, each little knot of them\r\napparently conversing among themselves, while acting as sentries to the\r\ngeneral herd of dauws, antelopes, and their own wives.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes' deliberation, the hunters agreed to make their\r\nattack upon the herd of gnoos.  They formed no plan.  Stalking would be\r\nof little use, as they believed they would be able to ride down the\r\nwildebeest, and get a running shot; and it was to these they designed to\r\ngive all their attention.  The dauws--beautiful creatures as they were--\r\nwere of no use as _game_, and it was game the party wanted.  The\r\nspringboks did not interest them; but the flesh of the wildebeest would\r\nhave been a treat to all.  It is excellent eating, resembling beef\r\nrather than venison--for the gnoo is in reality more of an ox than an\r\nantelope.\r\n\r\n\"Roast beef for dinner!\" was the word given by Hendrik, and all the rest\r\nechoing this, they charged down upon the wildebeest herd.\r\n\r\nThey made no attempt at concealing their approach, but dashed directly\r\nforward upon the game, the buck-dogs--now only five in number--in the\r\nadvance, with Hendrik's favourite heading.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the herds upon the plain were in motion--each species\r\ngoing its own way.  The dauws galloped off in a clump, holding a\r\nstraight course over the plain; the springboks scattering in every\r\ndirection, as is their wont; while the gnoos, first uniting into an\r\nirregular drove, ran forward some distance in a straight line, and then\r\nsome broke to right and left, wheeled round, and came scouring back to\r\nthe rear of the hunters!\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the whole appearance of the plain was changed.  The\r\nzebras had gone out of sight, so, too, the springboks.  The gnoos alone\r\nremained under the view of the hunters.  These were not to be seen in\r\nany particular direction.  They were everywhere around--some running off\r\nbefore the dogs--some wheeling around to the rear--some galloping past\r\nwithin two or three hundred yards, and then charging forward so near to\r\nthe horses, that some of the riders thought they meant to attack them.\r\nWith their fierce little eyes, their sharp curving horns, and black\r\nshaggy frontlets, they appeared most formidable enemies, and indeed they\r\n_are_ so when disposed to make an attack.\r\n\r\nWhen wounded they are dangerous even to a mounted hunter, but one afoot\r\nwould stand little chance of escape from their frenzied and impetuous\r\ncharge.  One of the oddest circumstances observed by the young yagers\r\nwas, that the bulls, instead of galloping right away, lingered in the\r\nrear of the retreating herd,--now wheeling round to gaze upon the\r\nhunters, snorting as they stood--now making a dash forward out of their\r\nway, and sometimes two of them facing each other, and engaging in\r\ncombat!  And these combats did not appear to be \"shams.\"  On the\r\ncontrary, the old bulls seemed to butt each other in good earnest,\r\nrushing at one another from a distance, dropping upon their knees, and\r\nbringing their heads together, till their horns, and the thick bony\r\nhelmet-like plates that covered their fronts, cracked loudly against\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThese battles appeared to be real; but, notwithstanding the earnestness\r\nof the combatants, they always gave up, and parted from the ground\r\nbefore the hunters could get within range.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding their carelessness about running away altogether, it was\r\nnot so easy a matter to get a fair shot at one; and our yagers might\r\nhave returned to camp empty-handed had it not been for their buck-dogs.\r\nThese, however, chanced to stick together, and having selected an old\r\nbull, soon separated him from the rest, and drove him at full speed\r\nacross the plain.  Hendrik and Groot Willem spurred after, and all the\r\nothers followed, though falling to the rear as the chase continued.\r\n\r\nBefore the bull had gone two miles, the dogs began to pester him, and\r\nfinding his heels failing he turned suddenly upon his canine pursuers,\r\nrushing at one and then another, as they came up, and knocking them over\r\nwith his horns.\r\n\r\nIt is possible he would have bayed all _five_ successfully; but the\r\napproach of the hunters caused him fresh alarm, and he broke bay, and\r\nonce more stretched himself at full speed across the plain.  Another\r\nmile would have brought him into some low timber, and he appeared to\r\nmake for that.  He kept ahead of the dogs for awhile longer, but when\r\nwithin about a hundred yards of the thicket, his wind again failed him;\r\nand as the buck-dogs were taking an occasional pull at his flanks, he\r\nbecame desperate and once more stood to bay.\r\n\r\nThe dogs soon ran in, but for awhile he was able to beat off all five,\r\nstriking then right and left.  At length some of them seized him by the\r\nthroat, while the others clung to his tail and hind-quarters, and the\r\nstruggle would no doubt have ended soon by their dragging the bull to\r\nthe earth; but Hendrik and Groot Willem rode up and ended it sooner by\r\nsending a pair of bullets through his ribs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY ONE.\r\n\r\nA BATTLE WITH A BORELe.\r\n\r\nHans and Arend on this occasion had followed the chase, and were almost\r\n\"in at the death;\" and Klaas and Jan, who from the openness of the\r\nground had had a view of the whole run, shortly after came up, spurring\r\ntheir panting ponies to the very top of their speed.\r\n\r\nAll six now dismounted to rest both themselves and horses after their\r\nsharp gallop, and also to skin the bull.  Though Arend was habitually\r\n_chef-de-cuisine_, Hendrik and Groot Willem were the butchers; Hans,\r\n\"the botanist of the expedition,\" might also be termed its\r\n\"green-grocer,\" as his knowledge of botany enabled him to keep the\r\ncamp-table supplied with many species of esculent roots and vegetables\r\nto be found growing wild upon the plains of Southern Africa.\r\n\r\nWhile Hendrik and Groot Willem were flaying off the skin, Hans and Arend\r\nwere busy with the head and horns, preparing them for preservation.  It\r\nwas nearly as much on account of these as for his meat that they had\r\nhunted the gnoo.  They would also be trophies in the halls of the Graaf\r\nReinet; for although the horns of the common gnoo are easily had, those\r\nof the brindled species are more precious, for the reason that the\r\nlatter animal inhabits a more remote part of the country.\r\n\r\nKlaas and Jan acted as assistants to the other four--now handing a\r\nknife, now holding a limb or flap of skin, and making themselves\r\n\"generally useful.\"  All six, therefore, were engaged.\r\n\r\nWhile thus employed, all of them bending and stooping one way or\r\nanother, over the dead bull, and none of them keeping a look-out, a\r\nqueer sound fell upon their ears that caused them to start all together\r\ninto an erect attitude.  The sound they had heard was a loud snort,\r\nfollowed by a blowing noise, somewhat similar to that made by terrified\r\nswine, but much fuller and louder.  There was, also, the noise of\r\nsnapping twigs and breaking branches.\r\n\r\nThese sounds caused all six to start, and some of them to tremble with\r\nfear; and the sight that came under their eyes as they looked up\r\nconfirmed them in that emotion.  In truth, it was a sight that would\r\nhave inspired with alarm older hearts than theirs.\r\n\r\nBreaking through the bushes, and causing the branches to bend and\r\ncrackle, came a large animal.  The tall upright horn upon its snout, its\r\nhuge heavy body, and strong massive limbs, left them no room to doubt\r\nwhat sort of animal it was.  It was a rhinoceros!\r\n\r\nThere are four species of these in South Africa; but the dark colour of\r\nits skin and the double horn proclaimed the one now seen to be the black\r\nrhinoceros, or \"borele\"--the fiercest and most dangerous of the four.\r\n\r\nWhen the boys first heard it, it was crashing through the bushes close\r\nto the edge of the thicket, but they had scarce turned their eyes in\r\nthat direction before it shot out of the timber, head towards them, and\r\ncame on at full gallop.  Its head was raised high in air, its ears were\r\nin motion, and its small but saucy-looking tail was flirted about in a\r\nconfident manner.  Its black eyes gleamed with a malicious expression,\r\nand its air was one of anger and menace.  The terror inspired by its\r\nlook was not lessened by the loud snorting and blowing that issued from\r\nits fiery nostrils.\r\n\r\nThe boys saw at once, and to their alarm, that it was charging upon\r\n_them_!  There could be no doubt about the matter.  Its whole appearance\r\ndenoted that it was bent upon attacking them, for it was heading\r\ndirectly for the spot where they stood.  They knew, moreover, that there\r\nwas nothing odd in that,--they knew that the black rhinoceros will\r\ncharge upon any creature, whether man, quadruped, bird, or _bush_,\r\nwithout the slightest provocation!\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the boys were in a dilemma, and were aware of\r\nit as well.  There were they, all six afoot upon the plain, with a\r\nfierce borele rushing up to them, and at less than a hundred yards\r\ndistance!\r\n\r\nFortunately for them the steeds were all well-trained, and fortunately\r\nthe riders had had the precaution to fasten them in such a manner that\r\nit required but little time to get them free.  But for these two\r\ncircumstances some one of the six must certainly have been lifted upon\r\nthe death-dealing horn of the borele.\r\n\r\nAs it was the horses had been tied all around a tree that stood near.\r\nEach had his bridle looped to a small branch, so small that it could be\r\nwrenched off in a second of time, but large enough to keep a horse\r\nsteady for awhile, unless something should alarm and startle him.  This\r\nwas a precaution the hunters had been taught by their fathers, and the\r\nknowledge now stood them in stead.\r\n\r\nOf course the moment the borele \"hove\" in sight, there was an end to the\r\nskinning of the gnoo.  There was a chorus of cries expressing terror, a\r\nflinging away of knives, a sudden rush to the horses, a seizing of\r\nbridles, a snapping off of branches, and a simultaneous leaping into six\r\nsaddles.  All these acts did not take ten seconds of time to accomplish,\r\nand the last of them was not accomplished one second too soon; for the\r\nriders had just time to turn the heads of their horses to the plain as\r\nthe borele came up.  In fact, so close to them had he got his hideous\r\nsnout that several of the horses shied and plunged as they took to\r\nflight, nearly dismounting one or two of the riders.  To have been\r\nunhorsed at that moment would have been a perilous business.\r\n\r\nAll kept their seats, however, and in a moment more were flying over the\r\nplain in a close clump, the borele snorting at their heels.\r\n\r\nNow that they were in their saddles, and galloped freely off, some of\r\nthe yagers were disposed to laugh.  Hendrik and Groot Willem were among\r\nthe number.  They knew that the speed of a rhinoceros is no match for\r\nthat of a horse, and they would soon get out of his way.  They were\r\ndisposed to regard the chase as a bit of fun rather than otherwise.  All\r\nat once, however, a thought came into their minds that turned their\r\nmerry mood into a feeling of new and painful apprehension.\r\n\r\nThe young yagers were riding in pairs.  Hendrik and Groot Willem,\r\nmounted on their swift horses, had forged some distance ahead of the\r\nothers.  On turning their faces backward they perceived that the two\r\nboys, Klaas and Jan, had fallen considerably to the rear, and that the\r\nborele was pushing them closely.  He was not twenty yards behind either,\r\nfor they rode side by side, as if in a racing gallop.  Hans and Arend\r\nwere further in advance, and these also looking back at the same instant\r\nperceived the perilous situation of their younger brothers.\r\n\r\nTo all four the idea seemed to occur at the same moment, that though a\r\nhorse can outrun the rhinoceros, a pony _cannot_, and the thought drew\r\nfrom them a simultaneous expression of alarm.  Beyond a doubt Klaas and\r\nJan were in danger.  Should the borele overtake them, their ponies would\r\nnot save them.  The huge brute would gore these animals to death, or\r\nimpale them at the first stroke of his stout sharp horn.  Beyond a doubt\r\nthe boys were in danger!\r\n\r\nSo thought their four brothers as they glanced back; and, as they\r\ncontinued to gaze, they became the more convinced of this fearful truth.\r\nThey saw that the distance between them and the rhinoceros, instead of\r\nwidening, was gradually growing less--the borele was gaining upon them!\r\n\r\nIt was a moment of painful apprehension with all four; but at this\r\nmoment Hendrik performed one of the neatest manoeuvres that had occurred\r\nduring the whole expedition.  With a wrench upon his bridle he turned\r\nsuddenly out of his course, and then wheeling round rode backward,\r\ncalling on Groot Willem to act similarly, but with his head turned to\r\nthe opposite side.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem, as if by instinct, obeyed, and, diverging suddenly from\r\neach other, the two wheeled right and left at the same instant.  Their\r\nhorses' heads were now turned to the rear, and after going a pace or two\r\nthey halted, and got their guns in readiness.\r\n\r\nFirst Hans and Arend swept past between the two halted hunters,--then\r\npassed Klaas and Jan upon the frightened ponies, and then came \"borele.\"\r\n\r\nBefore the last had got fairly on a line, Hendrik and Groot Willem\r\ncovered his huge body, fired, and then, galloping round to his rear,\r\ncommenced reloading.\r\n\r\nBoth balls took effect, and, though neither brought the brute to the\r\nground, they made a decided alteration in his pace, and in a moment it\r\nwas perceived that he was running slower, while the blood flowed freely\r\nfrom his wounds.  He still, however, kept on after the ponies; and it is\r\nhard to say how far he might have followed them, had it not been that\r\nHans and Arend, exactly imitating the manoeuvre of Hendrik and Groot\r\nWillem, now also wheeled right and left, came back a pace or two,\r\nhalted, and delivered their pieces in the face of the rhinoceros.\r\n\r\nAgain the bullets took effect, and again did not prove fatal.  But the\r\ndanger, as far as Klaas and Jan were concerned, was over; for the\r\nborele, instead of pursuing the ponies further, turned short on his\r\nnearer antagonists, and rushed first upon one, then the other, with all\r\nthe strength and fury that was left in his body.\r\n\r\nSeveral charges were made by him without effect, as the riders, now\r\nfaced towards him, were able to spring to one side and gallop out of his\r\nway.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a quarter of an hour the battle was kept up, the four loading\r\nand firing as fast as they could under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nAt length the day was decided by a bullet from the big elephant-gun of\r\nGroot Willem, which, penetrating the skull of the huge borele, sent him\r\nrolling over in the dust.\r\n\r\nA loud \"hurrah!\" proclaimed the victory, and the six yagers now rode up\r\nand alighted by the huge body of the borele, that, prostrate and\r\nlifeless, no longer caused them alarm.\r\n\r\nAn axe was obtained from the wagon, and his long anterior horn--a\r\nsplendid trophy--was hacked off from his snout, and carried away; while\r\nanother journey was made for the meat and horns of the blauw-wildebeest,\r\nwhich were packed behind the hunters upon the croups of their horses,\r\nand brought safely into camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY TWO.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERRUPTED BREAKFAST.\r\n\r\nNext morning the young yagers slept late--because they had nothing\r\nparticular to do.  They did not purpose continuing their journey before\r\nthe following morning; and on that day they intended to lie up, so that\r\ntheir horses, might rest and be fresh for the _road_.\r\n\r\nThey rose, therefore, a little later than usual, and breakfasted on the\r\ntongue of the brindled gnoo, with hot coffee and hard bread; a stock of\r\nwhich they had brought along in their wagons, and which still held out.\r\nIt would not have been as great a deprivation to the young yagers to\r\nhave gone without bread, as it would to you, boy reader.  There live\r\nmany people in South Africa to whom bread is a luxury almost unknown.\r\nMany tribes of the native people never eat such a thing, and there are\r\nthousands of the frontier Dutch colonists, that do without it\r\naltogether.  The people of South Africa, both native and colonial, are\r\nnot an _agricultural_ but a _pastoral people_, and therefore pay but\r\nlittle attention to the cultivation of the soil.  Their herds of horned\r\ncattle, their horses, their flocks of big-tailed sheep and goats,\r\nengross all their time, and _agricultural_ farming is not to their\r\ntaste.  Although the wealthier among the boors plant a few acres of\r\nKaffir corn--a variety of the \"Indian corn,\" or maize--and sow some\r\nbushels of \"buckwheat,\" yet this is principally for their own use.  This\r\nclass also cultivate many kinds of vegetables in their gardens, and have\r\nlarge orchards containing apples, peaches, pomegranates, pears, and\r\nquinces, with vineyards for the grape, and enclosures for melons,\r\ncucumbers, and pumpkins.  But among the poorer classes, and particularly\r\non the remote frontier, such things are hardly thought of; and their\r\ncattle _kraals_ are the only enclosures around the dwelling of the\r\n\"vee-boor,\" or stock-farmer.  Among these people, bread is a rarity, and\r\ntheir staple food is \"biltong,\" and fresh beef or mutton cooked in a\r\nvariety of ways, and so as to be quite palatable--for the _cuisine_ of\r\nthe boor is by no means to be despised.\r\n\r\nIn many parts the staple food of the frontier boor is venison--that is,\r\nin districts where the ordinary game has not yet been exterminated.\r\nWithin the frontier districts, springboks are plenty, as also the common\r\nwildebeests; and piles of the horns of these may be seen lying around\r\nthe kraals of every vee-boor.  The flesh of the wildebeests, as already\r\nstated, is more like beef than venison, and when fat, or cooked in the\r\ndelicious fat of the great sheep's tails, is excellent eating.\r\n\r\nThe quagga, which is also common in these parts, is killed for its\r\nflesh; but this is rank and oily, and only eaten by the Hottentot\r\nservants.\r\n\r\nOur young yagers were the children of wealthy parents, and had therefore\r\nlearnt to eat bread, though on a pinch they could have got along without\r\nit.  But they had brought several sacks of biscuit with them, and with\r\nthese and coffee, and the tongue of the blauw-wildebeest, they were\r\nmaking a hearty breakfast.\r\n\r\nThey were all right merry, chatting over their adventure with the\r\nborele, and laughing at the danger now that it was past.\r\n\r\nThey were taking their time with their breakfast, eating it leisurely\r\nand in no hurry, as they meant to spend the day in a sort of _dolce far\r\nniente_ manner--loitering about the camp, or perhaps putting in a stitch\r\nwherever there should be a weak place in either saddle or bridle, so as\r\nto make themselves thoroughly ready for the route.  Every precaution\r\nwould be required to ensure their safety against the wide stretch of\r\ndesert they would have to cross.\r\n\r\nWhile in this mood, and about half through with their meal, an\r\nannouncement was made that was likely to upset all their plans for the\r\nday.  The announcement came from Congo, who had been loitering out on\r\nthe desert side of the mokhala grove, and who came running into camp, in\r\nbreathless haste, to report that a large flock of ostriches were out\r\nupon the plain!\r\n\r\nThe yagers, but particularly Klaas and Jan, bristled up at the news,\r\nuttering various exclamations of joy.  A sudden change took place in\r\ntheir manner.  Their jaws wagged more rapidly; the gnoo-tongue\r\ndisappeared in larger slices; the coffee was quaffed in big hurried\r\ngulps; and the second half of their meal did not occupy the tenth part\r\nof the time that had been taken up with the first.\r\n\r\nIn less than two minutes from the time Congo made his report the\r\nbreakfast was finished; and in five minutes more the horses were all\r\nsaddled, bridled, and mounted.  Resting the animals was no longer\r\nthought of.  Everything had gone out of the heads of their riders except\r\nan ostrich \"surround.\"\r\n\r\nWhere was Swartboy to take part in the affair, and to give his advice?\r\nAll acknowledged that the Bushman knew more about hunting the ostrich\r\nthan any of them--Congo not excepted.  Indeed, this was true in regard\r\nto most kinds of _desert_ animals, as also of the smaller mammalia and\r\nbirds.  Congo had lived all his life among a people who keep cattle--for\r\nthe Kaffir nations are not mere hunters, but a pastoral people--and\r\nalthough he knew how to destroy the lion, the leopard, the hyena, and\r\nother carnivorous creatures, he was less accustomed to the killing or\r\ncapturing of game, since the vast herds of cattle bred and reared in his\r\ncountry render such knowledge but of secondary importance.  Not so with\r\nSwartboy.  The Bushmen have no cattle, except those which at times they\r\nsteal from their neighbours, the Griquas, Bastaards, and trek-boors; and\r\nthese are never _kept_, but killed and devoured as soon as they are\r\ndriven to the Bushmen haunts.  The want of domestic animals, therefore,\r\nwith the necessity of having something to eat, compels the Bushman to\r\nuse all his ingenuity in the capturing or killing of wild _game_, which\r\namong Bushmen includes every living creature from the locust and lizard\r\nto the camelopard and elephant!\r\n\r\nThe natural consequence of such a life must be the arriving at a perfect\r\nknowledge of the haunts, habits, and mode of hunting the wild creatures\r\nthat people their country; and in this very knowledge Swartboy was\r\nbelieved to excel even among his countrymen, for it was known that in\r\nhis own land he had been considered a \"mighty hunter.\"\r\n\r\nWhere was Swartboy at that moment?  He had not been seen for an hour or\r\nmore.  Congo said that he had driven off the oxen to pasture upon the\r\ngrass plain to the rear of the camp, and no doubt he was there herding\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was proposed that some one should go for him, but this was objected\r\nto on account of the loss of time.  Congo said that the oxen were a good\r\nway off.  It would take half-an-hour to bring Swartboy into camp, and\r\nbefore the end of that period the ostriches might be ten miles off.\r\n\r\nNo; they could not wait for Swartboy.  They must proceed without him;\r\nand, mounting their horses, the yagers rode off towards the desert\r\nplain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE OSTRICH \"SURROUND.\"\r\n\r\nOn reaching the edge of the grove they halted to reconnoitre, still\r\nkeeping under cover of the timber.  Congo had reported truly.  There\r\n_was_ a flock of ostriches, sure enough.  There were seven of these\r\ngreat birds in one \"clump,\" and an eighth at no great distance from the\r\nrest.  Of the seven, five appeared to be hens and two of them cocks.\r\nThe one apart was also a cock.  I say _appeared_ to be.  You will\r\nimagine there could be no doubt, since the male and female of these\r\nbirds are so very unlike in the colour of their plumage.  That is true\r\nwhen they have attained to a certain age; but the young males, even when\r\nfull-grown, do not get the beautiful white feathers all at once, and for\r\na long time can hardly at a distance be distinguished from the females.\r\n\r\nThat, however, was not the reason why the young yagers were in doubt\r\nabout their sex.  It was because the birds were in a position nearly due\r\neast from the point of observation, and the sun being yet only a few\r\ndegrees above the horizon, his rays fell in such a manner as to prevent\r\nthem from having a clear view.  To use a common phrase, the sun was \"in\r\ntheir eyes.\"\r\n\r\nFor all that, they could count the ostriches, and believed that of the\r\neight three were cocks and the rest hens.\r\n\r\nThe seven in the \"clump\" were stationary; that is, they were not moving\r\naway from the spot.  Some were stalking leisurely about, occasionally\r\ntaking a \"peck;\" and it must have been sand or pebbles they were eating,\r\nas there was not the semblance of vegetation near the spot.  Some sat\r\nsquatted upon their \"hams,\" their long legs doubled underneath; and one\r\nor two were lying along the ground, and fluttering in the sand, just as\r\ncommon hens and turkeys do in warm weather.  The dust raised by these\r\nformed a little cloud that floated around them, and added to the\r\ndifficulty of distinguishing either their sex or their movements.  The\r\nseven were at no great distance from the edge of the mokhala grove, and\r\nthe one that was separate was still nearer.  He was going towards them,\r\nstooping his head at intervals, and feeding as he went.  From this\r\ncircumstance, the boys conjectured that he had been much nearer, which\r\nconjecture was strengthened by Congo, who said, that when he had first\r\nobserved them, this old cock was not two hundred yards from the edge of\r\nthe timber, and was then going out, just as now.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he had been within shot of the cover.  What a pity, thought\r\nKlaas and Jan, they had not been earlier on the look-out!\r\n\r\nThe hunters did not waste many moments in watching the manoeuvres of the\r\nbirds.  Their attention was entirely given to their purpose of\r\nsurrounding them, and discussing a plan to effect that object.  Now\r\nthese ostriches were not near the nest which had been plundered, and was\r\nnow deserted; nor was it likely that the were of the family to whom that\r\nnest belonged--not even relatives in fact--else they would have heard of\r\nthe calamity, and would have been comporting themselves in a very\r\ndifferent manner from the easy style in which they were taking it.  None\r\nof the five hens could be they that, but two days before, had witnessed\r\nthe fall of their plumed lord by the Bushman's arrow, for it was not\r\nlikely that these would return to that part of the country.  The flock\r\nnow seen had no connection whatever with the nest.  The place they were\r\nin was at a good distance from the scene of the late tragedy.\r\n\r\nThe young yagers were glad of this; not that they cared about the matter\r\nof relationship, but because the place where the birds were now seen\r\noffered superior advantages for a \"surround.\"  It was a sort of large\r\nbay, where a spur of the desert plain ran into the timber, and was more\r\nthan half encircled by low woods and thickets of acacia.  Only one\r\nside--that toward the wide desert--was open.  On all other sides there\r\nwas cover for the hunters.\r\n\r\nOn this account the latter had very little difficulty in deciding how to\r\nact, and in a few minutes their plan was arranged.\r\n\r\nHendrik and Groot Willem, being the best mounted, were to ride to the\r\ntwo most distant points, one of them taking the right side of the great\r\nbay, the other the left.  They were to keep under cover of the thicket\r\nall the way round; and when either arrived at the point where the timber\r\nstretched farthest out upon the plain, he was to stop awhile, until the\r\nother showed himself on the opposite side.  Both were then to gallop\r\ntowards each other, but not to meet.  They were to halt at such a\r\ndistance from one another as would best enable them to cut off the\r\nretreat of the ostriches from the outer plain.\r\n\r\nHans and Arend were respectively to follow in the tracks of Hendrik and\r\nGroot Willem; but they were to halt within the edge of the timber when\r\nhalf round, and wait until they should see the others out upon the\r\nplain.  Then they were to show themselves, and turn the ostriches,\r\nshould they run their way.\r\n\r\nKlaas and little Jan were also to separate and ride some distance from\r\nthe spot; but the disposal of these boys in their places was taken in\r\nhand by the others; and so the whole party started at the same time,\r\nthree filing off to the right, and three to the left.  Congo's\r\ninstructions were, not to show himself until he should perceive Hendrik\r\nand Groot Willem galloping towards each other.  He was then to act just\r\nas the others, except that \"shanks'-mare\" was to be his horse.\r\n\r\nShould the ostriches allow time for Hendrik and Groot Willem to get to\r\ntheir stations, the surround would be complete; and it was highly\r\nprobable that they would have good sport, and either capture or kill\r\nsome of the giant birds.  When thus assailed upon all sides, the ostrich\r\ngets confused, and acts in the most stupid manner, being easily turned,\r\nand driven about from \"post to pillar.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a question of time, therefore, and it would take a good while for\r\nthe surround to be made, as the plain on which the birds were was full\r\nthree miles wide.  Both Hendrik and Groot Willem would have twice that\r\nlength to ride; and their path lying through bushes, they would be\r\nunable to move faster than a walk.\r\n\r\nFor some time the only one that watched the movements of the ostriches\r\nwas the Kaffir.  The others were making their way through the thicket,\r\nand only had a peep now and then, as they passed some place where an\r\nopening in the leaves allowed them.  They were too anxious, however, to\r\nget to their different stands to stop at any place between.  All felt\r\nthat time was precious; for should the game take alarm, and start off to\r\nthe open plain, the trouble they were taking would be all in vain.  None\r\nof them, therefore, thought of looking at the birds--only to satisfy\r\nthemselves that they were still there--until they had reached their\r\nrespective places.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE ODD COCK.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Congo watched the movement of the flock as well as\r\nthe sun in his eyes would allow him.\r\n\r\nHe noticed that the cock that had been feeding apart from the rest had\r\nnow got close up to them,--within a few yards; but that the others had\r\narisen at his approach, and, stretching out their long necks, appeared\r\nto regard him as a stranger.  After a moment all seven turned, as if\r\nalarmed at something, and ran away--the odd cock running after, though\r\nfalling a little in the rear.\r\n\r\nThe flock only went for twenty yards or so, and then halted, as if they\r\nhad got over their slight alarm.\r\n\r\nThe old cock again stalked slowly up, now and then dropping his head to\r\nthe ground, and pecking up a grain or two of something on his way.\r\n\r\nWhen he got close to the flock a second time, they seemed to take fresh\r\nalarm, ran twenty yards farther, and again stopped.\r\n\r\nIt appeared as if the old cock was a stranger to the rest, and that they\r\nconsidered his presence an intrusion!\r\n\r\nAgain he approached them, and again they made a short run; this time not\r\nin a direct line, but in a circle around him, so that they came back\r\nnearly to their original ground.  This time, however, only the five hens\r\nran off.  Both the cocks remained near the spot; but the movements of\r\nthese now puzzled Congo not a little.\r\n\r\nOne of them had squatted down, just as they had been first observed,\r\nwhile the other ran about in very small circles, occasionally fluttering\r\nhis white plumes, and acting altogether like a drunken man!\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes the manoeuvres of all appeared to change.  The one\r\nthat had seated himself appeared to _lie_ down and remain quiet, while\r\nhe that had the \"staggers\" squatted down not far off; and presently a\r\nhen came running up and sat down beside him; so that now there remained\r\nupon their feet only one cock and four of the hens.\r\n\r\nThe whole scene puzzled Congo, who was not from an ostrich country, and\r\nwas but indifferently acquainted with the habits of these birds.  No\r\ndoubt, thought he, the creatures were about some game of their own, such\r\nas he had often seen with the \"kooran\" and partridges.\r\n\r\nThere were others than Congo puzzled at what was passing among the\r\nostriches.\r\n\r\nKlaas and Jan, who had reached their stations sooner than the rest, and\r\nwho had been observing the odd actions of the birds, were both puzzled\r\nas to what they were about; and a little later Hans and Arend had a\r\nsurprise, and were equally at a loss what to think of the game of \"fits\r\nand starts\" that was going on upon the plain.\r\n\r\nBut Hans and Arend had not much time to observe.  They had both gone far\r\nround, and they expected soon to see Hendrik and Groot Willem gallop out\r\nfrom the timber, so they kept their eyes in that direction.\r\n\r\nThey were not disappointed.  A few minutes after both were seen to shoot\r\nforth at full speed, and ride in diverging lines, so as to approach each\r\nother, and at the same time get nearer to the ostriches.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the others saw them, the whole five, Congo included, showed\r\nthemselves on the open ground, all making towards a common centre--the\r\nspot where the ostriches were.\r\n\r\nThe hunters were now more surprised than ever.  As they rode forward,\r\nthey perceived that several of the great birds were seated, or lying\r\nupon the ground.  They were basking, no doubt; but, for birds so wary,\r\nwhy did they not spring up and take to flight?  They must already have\r\nperceived the approach of the horses or heard the sound of their\r\ntrampling hoofs?  Only two of the hens appeared at all alarmed; and\r\nthese ran in the direction of the outer plain, but turned when they saw\r\nHendrik and Groot Willem.  Only one other was upon its feet; and that\r\nwas the old cock that had kept apart?  He was still standing erect, but\r\ndid not attempt to fly!  It was very odd.\r\n\r\nThis old cock chanced to be nearest to Hendrik and Groot Willem; and\r\ngoing, as they were, at race-horse speed, they were scarce a minute in\r\nriding down upon him.\r\n\r\nThey had got within less than five hundred yards; and, with guns ready,\r\nwere resolved to give him a tail-on-end chase, and try a flying shot,\r\nwhen, to their tremendous surprise, a loud and terrified yell came from\r\nthe bird, and the next moment his skin flew from his shoulders,\r\ndiscovering, not a naked ostrich, but a naked Bushman, with his legs\r\nchalked white to the very hips!  _That Bushman was Swartboy_!\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, old Swart dressed up in the skin of the old cock he had\r\nlately shot with his poisoned arrow; and it was that same arrow, or\r\nhalf-a-dozen like it, that had been causing the mysterious movements\r\namong the ostriches.  Five of them already lay around dead or dying;\r\nwhile the two hens, that had not yet received their billet, during the\r\nsurprise consequent on Swartboy revealing himself, had managed to\r\nescape.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Swartboy he \"sung out\" at the moment he did.  Another\r\nhalf minute, and he would have fared no better than his own victims the\r\nostriches.  He acknowledged that he had been badly \"scared.\"  In looking\r\nafter the ostriches, he had never thought of looking for any thing else;\r\nand from the manner in which his eyes were placed under the feathers, he\r\ncould not see very well around.  His ears, too, \"muffled\" up as they\r\nwere within the skin of the old cock, were of little service to him; so\r\nthat it was by mere accident he saw the horsemen galloping down upon\r\nhim.  Even then it cost an effort to \"cast\" his skin, and appear _in\r\npropria persona_!\r\n\r\nNow, when the young yagers thought of the curious incident that had just\r\ntaken place, and then looked at the naked body of Swartboy, chalked\r\nwhite from hip to heel, the whole six sat in their saddles and laughed\r\ntill their very sides ached.\r\n\r\nSwartboy, proud of his achievement, looked round him like a conqueror,\r\nand then fixing his eyes upon his rival, put the simple but equivocal\r\ninterrogatory--\r\n\r\n\"Eh!  Congo! ole Kaffir boy! dat you?\"\r\n\r\n_The carapace was eclipsed_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nBLESBOKS AND BONTEBOKS.\r\n\r\nNext morning our party inspanned and treked over the desert plain in a\r\nnorth-easterly direction.  They were two days in crossing it, and their\r\noxen suffered much from thirst, as during the two days they did not\r\ntaste water.  For themselves they had water enough.  Part of the\r\ncontents of each wagon was a good water-cask, that held eighteen\r\ngallons; and these, of course, they had filled before leaving the\r\nspring.  One of these casks they divided among their horses, allowing\r\nthem a little over two gallons apiece; but that was nothing for two\r\ndays' march over such a country.  Even the yagers themselves required as\r\nmuch.  This statement would not surprise you, if you had ever travelled\r\nin a tropical clime and over an arid waterless plain under a hot glaring\r\nsun.  There thirst is provoked in a short while, and water will quench\r\nit only for a few minutes at a time.  The appetite constantly returns,\r\nand calls for copious draughts; so that a traveller will often consume\r\nnot glasses, but gallons, of water, in a single day!\r\n\r\nHaving crossed the desert plain, the hunters now entered upon a country\r\nthat differed entirely from that they had left behind.\r\n\r\nThey had arrived in a country of vast extent, upon which stood hills of\r\nstrange and varied forms.  Some were of a rounded, hemispherical shape;\r\nothers were cones; others had flat-table tops; and still others pierced\r\nthe sky with sharp needle-like pinnacles.  These hills were of various\r\nsizes--some approaching the dimension of mountains; but most of them\r\nrose directly from the plains, without any _piedmont_ or \"foothills\"\r\nintervening between the level surface and their sloping or precipitous\r\nsides.  The country bore a very strong resemblance to the plateaux that\r\nlie among the Cordilleras of the Andes; and the geological formation of\r\nthis part of Africa is very similar to the table-lands of Mexico.\r\n\r\nMany of the mountains of conical and pyramid form stood isolated upon\r\nthe plain, some of them bare of vegetation from base to summit.  Others,\r\nagain, carried a dark mantle of forest, that covered only their lower\r\nhalf, above which rose bare peaks of white quartz that under the sun\r\nglittered like snow.\r\n\r\nThe plains between were some of them of vast extent--so wide that at\r\ntimes the mountains that bordered them could be but dimly seen.  But\r\nthere were plains of every size and form.  Their surface was covered\r\nwith a species of grass quite different from that of the region our\r\nhunters had hitherto been passing over.  It formed a short sward like a\r\nmeadow lately mown, or a well-browsed pasture-ground, for such in\r\nreality it was--well-browsed and closely cropped, and trodden to a hard\r\nturf, by the countless herds of wild ruminant animals, of which it was\r\nthe favourite range.  Unlike the long flowing sweet grass upon the\r\nplains south of the Orange River, these were covered with a short crisp\r\ncurly herbage of saltish taste; and in many spots an effervescence of\r\nthat mineral covered the ground, whitening the blades of grass like a\r\nhoar-frost.  Salt deposits, or salt-pans as they are termed, were also\r\ncommon, some of them extending for miles over the plain.\r\n\r\nThe yagers had reached a peculiar country, indeed.  They had arrived in\r\nthe \"zuur-veldt,\" the country of the sour grass--the favourite home of\r\nthe _blesbok_ and _bontebok_.\r\n\r\nWhat are these?\r\n\r\nThey are two antelopes, whose gracefulness of form, swiftness of foot,\r\nbut, above all, the lively and striking colour of their bodies, have\r\nrendered remarkable.\r\n\r\nThey belong to the genus _Gazella_, but in many of their habits they\r\ndiffer considerably from the gazelles, though differing so slightly from\r\neach other that by both travellers and naturalists they have been\r\nregarded identical.\r\n\r\nThis is not so.  They are distinct species, though inhabiting the same\r\ncountry, and following the same mode of life.  The blesbok (_Gazella\r\nalbifrons_) is neither so large nor so brilliantly marked as the\r\nbontebok, (_Gazella pygarga_).  His horns are of a light colour, nearly\r\nwhite, while those of the bontebok are black.  In the colour of the legs\r\nthere is also a marked difference.  The legs of the bontebok are white\r\nfrom the knee down, while those of his congener are only white on the\r\ninsides--the outsides being brown.\r\n\r\nThe bontebok is not only one of the loveliest antelopes in Africa, but\r\none of the swiftest.  Indeed, there are those who hold that he is _the\r\nswiftest_.  In size he equals the European stag, and his form is light\r\nand graceful.  His horns are fifteen inches in length, black, robust at\r\nthe base, semi-annulated and diverging.  They rise erect from the top of\r\nhis head, bending slightly backward, and then forward at the tips.\r\n\r\nBut it is the beautiful colouring of his skin which is the principal\r\ncharacteristic of this antelope.  In this respect both he and the\r\nblesbok bear some resemblance to the antelopes of the _acronotine_\r\ngroup--the hartebeest and sassabye.\r\n\r\nThe colours of the bontebok are purple violet and brown of every shade--\r\nnot mingling together, but marking the body as if laid on by the brush\r\nof a sign-painter.  Hence the name \"bontebok,\" or \"painted buck,\" as\r\ngiven by the Dutch colonists to this species.  First, the neck and head\r\nare of a deep brown, with a tinge of the colour of arterial blood.\r\nBetween the horns a white stripe commences, and after reaching the line\r\nof the eyes widens out so as to cover the face to the very muzzle.  This\r\nmark, or \"blaze,\" is common to both the species, and to one of them has\r\ngiven the trivial name \"blesbok,\" (blaze-buck.)\r\n\r\nThe back is of a blue lilac colour, as if glazed; and this extends along\r\nthe sides, so as to remind one of a saddle.  Bordering this, and running\r\nalong the flanks, is a broad band of deep purple brown.  The belly and\r\ninsides of the thighs are of pure white colour; the legs are white from\r\nthe knees down, and there is a large white patch on the croup.  The tail\r\nreaches to the hocks, and is tufted with black hair.  Such is the colour\r\nof the bontebok, and that of the blesbok differs from it only in the\r\npoints already mentioned, and in its colours being somewhat less marked\r\nand brilliant.  Both are beautiful creatures, and their skins are much\r\nprized by the native savages for making the \"kaross,\"--a garment that\r\nserves them both as a cloak by day and a bed and blankets at night.\r\n\r\nThe habits of both species are quite similar.  They dwell upon the\r\nplains of the \"zuur-veldt,\" congregating in vast herds of many thousands\r\nthat cover the ground with their purple masses.\r\n\r\nIn this respect they resemble the springboks and other gazelles; but\r\nthey have habits peculiar to themselves.  The springboks, when alarmed,\r\ntake to flight and scatter off in any direction, whereas the bonteboks\r\nand blesboks invariably run against the wind, bearing their noses close\r\nalong the ground, like hounds upon a trail!\r\n\r\nThey are fleeter than springboks, and also more shy and wary, as though\r\nthey knew that their spoils are more valuable to the hunter, and\r\ntherefore required greater skill and speed to preserve them.\r\n\r\nBoth species were once common in what are now the settled districts of\r\nSouth Africa, their range extending to the Cape itself.  That is now\r\nrestricted to the \"zuur-veldt\" districts, north of the Great Orange\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nA few bonteboks are still found within the colonial borders in the\r\ndistrict of Swellendam; but their existence there is accounted for by an\r\nact of the Government, which places a fine of six hundred rix-dollars\r\nupon any one who may destroy them without licence.\r\n\r\nOur young yagers had now arrived in the land of the blesbok and\r\nbontebok.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SIX.\r\n\r\nSTALKING THE BLESBOKS.\r\n\r\nWhen they had got fairly within the boundaries of the blesbok country,\r\nthe young yagers resolved to make halt for a day or two, and hunt these\r\nbeautiful antelopes.  Not that they desired their flesh, but they wished\r\nto strip one or two of them of their bright, parti-coloured robes, to be\r\nhung up along with their horns in the halls of Graaf Reinet.\r\n\r\nAfter treking some miles across the plains, they outspanned by a vley,\r\nand formed their camp.\r\n\r\nThe following morning they mounted their horses, and proceeded over the\r\nplain in search of the purple antelopes.\r\n\r\nThey were not long in finding them.  That is by no means a difficult\r\nthing with an animal that herds together in thousands, provided you\r\nchance to be in the district it inhabits; and the yagers were not slow\r\nin coming within view of a herd of blesboks.\r\n\r\nBut how to hunt them was a knowledge which none of the party possessed--\r\nwhether to let slip the buck-dogs and gallop right into the thick of the\r\nherd, or to get within shot by stalking--which of these was the proper\r\nmanner neither the young yagers nor their drivers knew.  In Swartboy's\r\ncountry neither blesboks nor bonteboks are known.  They do not range to\r\nthe western half of South Africa, and the young yagers only knew them by\r\ntradition.  Their fathers had hunted them years before; but both species\r\nhad been long since exterminated south of the Orange River.\r\n\r\nAs for Congo, although their range extended into a part of the Kaffir\r\ncountry, he had never chanced to hunt in that particular district.  Of\r\ncourse neither Bushman nor Kaffir were on the ground with the hunters.\r\nThey had been left in charge of the camp; but the advice of both had\r\nbeen asked at setting out, and it was ascertained that they had none to\r\ngive.\r\n\r\nThe hunters were at a loss how to proceed, and held a discussion upon\r\nit.  Groot Willem thought they should be hunted like springboks,--that\r\nis, the hunters should take stand and conceal themselves, while one or\r\ntwo rode round and drove the game upon these--a mode practised with the\r\nfallow-deer in the forests of North America, and there termed \"driving.\"\r\n\r\nHendrik believed that they could be \"ridden into,\" and run down by the\r\ndogs.\r\n\r\nHans recommended \"stalking,\" with which, plan Arend agreed.  Of course\r\nno opinion was either asked from or given by the lads Klaas and Jan.\r\nHad they been birds, they would have insisted upon their \"say\" as well\r\nas their elder brothers.\r\n\r\nBut blesboks are not birds, although in less than an hour after they\r\nproved themselves to be almost as swift.\r\n\r\nNow, as stalking was the mode least likely to give the herd the alarm\r\nand seed them off, it could be tried first.  Should no one succeed in\r\ngetting within shot, then Groot Willem's plan might be adopted; and\r\nshould it also fail to be successful, it would still not be too late to\r\nfollow Hendrik's advice, and ride right at them.\r\n\r\nFirst, then, for a \"stalk.\"\r\n\r\nThey were not going to stalk them upon horseback.  That would never do,\r\nthough there are some animals that will suffer a mounted man to approach\r\nhearer than one afoot.  But blesboks are not of that kind.\r\n\r\nAll dismounted, therefore, and proceeded on foot in the direction of the\r\nherd.  Not all, exactly.  Klaas and Jan remained on the spot in charge\r\nof the dogs and horses.  Klaas and Jan were to have no share in the\r\nstalk.\r\n\r\nThe herd was in the middle of a vast open plain--so wide that the\r\nmountains on its opposite side were scarcely visible.  Upon all that\r\nplain not a bush or rock appeared.  The grass, as already stated, was\r\nshort cropped, and smooth as a meadow--not a break in the surface to\r\noffer a chance of concealment to the hunter!  How, then, could they talk\r\nof \"stalking\" on such ground?  They knew that no wild animal, however\r\nstupid or negligent, would permit them to walk up within point-blank\r\nrange and fire at them.  How, then, were they going to approach the\r\nblesboks, that they had heard were any thing but stupid--on the\r\ncontrary, were exceedingly shy and watchful of danger?  How?  That is a\r\npeculiar point, and requires explanation.\r\n\r\nAlthough there were neither rocks, nor trees, nor bushes of any kind,\r\nnor long grass, nor inequalities in the ground, there was still a\r\nspecies of \"cover.\"  Not the best, it is true, but such as would serve a\r\nskilful hunter who knew how to take advantage of it.  Enough to give\r\nhopes to the yagers, else they would not have dreamt of such a thing as\r\nan attempt to stalk the blesboks.\r\n\r\nScattered over the plain, and standing at irregular distances of from\r\none to three hundred yards of each other, were numerous singular\r\nstructures.  They were of the form of obtuse cones, or hemispherical,\r\nand all of a light grey colour--the colour of sun-dried mud.  On the\r\nsides of most of them at their bases could be seen a hole of irregular\r\noutlines, and evidently not made by the neat workmen who had built the\r\nmounds.  Quite the contrary.  These entrances to the hollow domes within\r\nwere not for them.  Theirs were underground.  These had been made by\r\ntheir enemies--the burglars who had plundered their houses.  I am sure I\r\nneed hardly tell you that the structures thus described were ant-hills,\r\nand that the big holes in this side were the work of the long-tongued\r\n\"aard-vark,\" or the scaly \"pangolin.\"\r\n\r\nThe hills in question were dome-shaped, and of moderate size--varying\r\nfrom one to three feet in height.  This is by no means as large as many\r\nant-hills found in Southern Africa.  Some are four times that height, or\r\nstill higher; but I have told you elsewhere of these high hills, and\r\nthat there are different species of ants who construct such curious\r\nnests--each species choosing its own style of architecture,--some the\r\ncone, or pyramidal form,--some a complete cluster of cones,--some build\r\nthem of cylindrical shape, and others nearly half-spherical, like\r\ninverted tea-basins.\r\n\r\nOf these last were the ant-hills now under the eyes of the young yagers.\r\nThey were the nests of the _Termes mordax_--a species that inhabits all\r\nthe plains of the \"zuur-veldt\" country.\r\n\r\nThe hunters proceeded to stalk forward, their eyes bent upon the\r\nantelopes, and their hopes fixed upon the ant-hills.\r\n\r\nOf course they did not commence crouching, until they had tried how near\r\nthe blesboks would allow them to come without cover.  This they soon\r\ndiscovered to be about four hundred yards; and although the animals did\r\nnot seem to mind their presence at that distance, but continued\r\nbrowsing, yet the moment any one of the four endeavoured to get nearer,\r\nthe herd, as if mechanically, moved off, and still kept a width of four\r\nhundred yards between themselves and the stalkers.\r\n\r\nThe hunters now began to stalk in earnest, crouching from hill to hill.\r\nIt was to no purpose.  None of the four could get within shot.  They\r\nseparated and took different sides.  The same result followed--a\r\nfailure.  Although the herd kept on, and always in the same general\r\ndirection, they seemed instinctively to avoid whatever ant-heap a hunter\r\nhad chosen, giving it a \"wide berth\" which carried them beyond the reach\r\neven of Groot Willem's roer!  After two hours spent in this fruitless\r\nkind of hunting, the plan was abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe \"stalk\" would not do; and Hans and Arend were now sneered and\r\nlaughed at by Hendrik and Groot Willem.\r\n\r\n\"What could _they_ know about hunting?  Ha! ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nDRIVING THE BLESBOKS.\r\n\r\nAll now returned to their horses.  Groot Willem's plan was next to be\r\ntried.\r\n\r\nThey mounted.  Klaas and Jan were permitted to take part in this affair.\r\nThey would do well enough to \"drive\" the antelopes, while the other\r\nfour would take stand, and receive them as they came up.\r\n\r\nAll six rode off towards the herd, which, during the stalk, had moved\r\nseveral miles across the plain.\r\n\r\nWhen as near as they might safely go, without causing the animals to\r\ntake the alarm, Klaas and Jan were sent to one side, while the stand-men\r\ntook the other, going to their places by a wide circuit.  Of course\r\ntheir horses enabled them to get to their positions in a very little\r\ntime.  It was not necessary that these should be near the herd.  As soon\r\nas they should conceal themselves behind the hills, Klaas and Jan were\r\nto drive the game up; and they were instructed to do so gently, and\r\nwithout causing the bucks to break into flight.  The lads were hunters\r\nenough to manage that point.\r\n\r\nThe four having got round to that side of the herd opposite to where the\r\ndrivers had been sent, tied their bridles together, and, leaving their\r\nhorses, walked towards the herd.  They deployed from each other as they\r\nwent, so as to cover a good stretch of the plain, and then each choosing\r\nan ant-hill, knelt down behind it.\r\n\r\nThere could be no mistake now.  The antelopes, driven by Klaas and Jan,\r\nwould come their way; springboks certainly would; and then, \"crack!\r\ncrack!\" would go the rifles, and \"bang!\"  Groot Willem's roer.\r\n\r\nThis gentleman was in particularly high glee.  He had recommended this\r\nmode in opposition to Hans and Arend; but he did not mind that, for he\r\nhad rather a contemptuous opinion of the hunter-craft of these two\r\n\"yagers;\" but what he thought of was, that Hendrik had opposed it, and\r\nshould it prove successful after that opposition, it would be a feather\r\nin Groot Willem's _hat_.\r\n\r\nThat it would succeed he had little doubt.  They were all nicely placed.\r\nThe two boys had got round to the opposite side of the herd, and once\r\nthese showed themselves a little nearer, the antelopes would face\r\nround--they were browsing _towards_ the side to which the boys had been\r\nsent--and feed in the direction of the concealed hunters.  Springboks\r\nwould do so, said Groot Willem to himself.\r\n\r\nBut springboks are not blesboks.  They differ not only in size and\r\ncolour, but in many of their habits; and just by a difference in one of\r\nthese last was Groot Willem destined to disappointment.  A curious habit\r\nthey have--and one which is shared by a few other animals, both of the\r\nantelope and deer species--knocked all Groot Willem's fine calculations\r\ninto \"pie.\"\r\n\r\nInstead of turning when Klaas and Jan approached them from the opposite\r\nside, as all expected they would do, the stubborn creatures would not be\r\nturned, but kept on most determinedly in their original course.  It is\r\ntrue that they swerved a little to _get past_ the boys; but as soon as\r\nthey were fairly beyond them, they headed once more in the same\r\ndirection as before.\r\n\r\nKlaas and Jan were at some distance from each other, so as to make a\r\nwider front to the drive; but for all that, the blesboks swept past both\r\nat such a distance as to give no chance for a bullet, even though sent\r\nfrom the long roer.  Neither of the boys fired, as they had been told\r\nnot to do; and as both behaved discreetly and quietly, the antelopes,\r\nafter galloping some distance to their rear, slackened their pace, and\r\nagain commenced browsing.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem felt considerably chagrined at the result, and got well\r\nlaughed at by both Hans and Arend; but what annoyed him still more was a\r\nword or two uttered by the rival hunter.\r\n\r\n\"I knew,\" said Hendrik emphatically--\"I knew it wouldn't do.  Do you\r\ntake blesboks for sheep, to be driven about by a pair of boys mounted on\r\nponies?  Bah!\"\r\n\r\nThis was a terrible cut for Groot Willem; but he replied to it by\r\nalleging that his plan had not had a fair trial.  It was now plain to\r\nall that the blesboks _fed up wind_; and, therefore, the _stand-men_\r\nshould have headed them instead of the _drivers_.\r\n\r\n\"Let us try it that way.  I'll warrant you we'll succeed.  If we don't,\r\nthen we can do as _Master_ Hendrik recommends; and we'll see how _his_\r\nplan, which is no plan at all, may answer.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a slight touch of sarcasm in Groot Willem's tone when he\r\nreferred to Hendrik, and the emphasis on the \"Master,\" partook strongly\r\nof the character of a sneer counter to _his_ which Hendrik had given.\r\n\r\nThere could be no objection to try the thing over again, according to\r\nthe mode suggested by Groot Willem; and they all assented to his\r\nproposal.  It _was_ plain that the blesboks ran in the \"wind's eye,\"\r\nelse they never would have \"run the gauntlet\" against Klaas and Jan, as\r\nthey had done.  Such being the case, the hunters, by laying in wait to\r\nwindward, would have a decided advantage, and, properly placed, could\r\nnot fail to reach some of the advancing herd.\r\n\r\nShould the scheme turn out differently, then they could follow Hendrik's\r\nadvice, and ride _tail-on-end_ upon the blesboks.\r\n\r\nWith these ideas, the four galloped away to one side, and, making a wide\r\n_detour_, headed the game.  Klaas and Jan were left in the rear to\r\nfollow it up, and force it gently forward.\r\n\r\nIn good time the stand-men were again placed, and watched the advancing\r\nantelopes with interest.  The \"blaze\" upon their faces appeared larger\r\nand larger, and their broad, white muzzles gleamed in the eyes of the\r\nhunters, almost within range of their guns.  But at this moment, the\r\nanimals raised their graceful necks, uttered a strange, snorting cry,\r\nand then, instead of turning to fly back, bounded right forward!\r\n\r\nSurely they were coming within range, thought every one, as he knelt\r\nwith ready firelock behind his sheltering mound.  \"Good!\" muttered Groot\r\nWillem to himself.  \"I'll turn the laugh upon the whole of them--that I\r\nshall.\"\r\n\r\nBut Groot Willem was destined once more to a humiliating disappointment.\r\nAs the blesboks came under the lee of each hill that covered a hunter,\r\nthey suddenly swerved, and swept round him at such a distance as to\r\nrender shooting at them a perfectly ridiculous thing.  Groot Willem had\r\nlevelled his roer for a chance shot, when he thought of the unpleasant\r\nconsequences of a \"miss;\" and reluctantly bringing down his piece he\r\npermitted the blesboks to sweep past.\r\n\r\nIn a few seconds the herd was far beyond the place where they had passed\r\nthe hunters; but as no assault had been made upon them, and no gun\r\nfired, they quieted down after a while, and once more commenced\r\nbrowsing.\r\n\r\nHendrik was now the proud man of the hour.  He would show them how the\r\nslow creatures could be galloped into.  He would run half-a-dozen of\r\nthem down before they could clear out of the plain.\r\n\r\n\"Come on!\"\r\n\r\nAll once again mounted their horses, and rode briskly towards the herd.\r\nWhen near, they moved more slowly and quietly, so as not to startle\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they had got within the usual distance of four hundred yards,\r\nthe bucks moved forward; and then came the \"view hilloa!\"  The dogs were\r\nlet slip, the horses sprang forward, and the chase swept wildly over the\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nThey had not galloped a mile, before Hendrik discovered his mistake.\r\nBoth dogs and horses were distanced by the swift antelopes, and both\r\nlagged far behind.\r\n\r\nOne by one the hunters fell into the rear, and drew up their foaming\r\nsteeds; and in less than twenty minutes time, Hendrik alone, and one or\r\ntwo of the best dogs, held on.\r\n\r\nHans and Arend, believing that it was a hopeless chase for their horses,\r\ngave it up; and Groot Willem _did not wish to succeed_!  Of course,\r\nKlaas and Jan were with the hindmost; and they all sat in their saddles,\r\nwatching first the purple backs of the bucks, and then the head and\r\nshoulders of Hendrik disappearing among the distant ant-hills!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nHENDRIK'S HARD GALLOP.\r\n\r\nOn swept the blesboks over the level sward and on galloped Hendrik after\r\nthem--his horse and dogs running at their utmost speed.  For all that,\r\nnot a yard could either hunter or hounds gain upon the swift antelopes.\r\nThere was no chance for either to \"run cunning.\"  There was no taking \"a\r\ncut\" upon the game.  The blesboks made not the slightest double--swerved\r\nnot a point from their course, but ran in a straight line, dead in the\r\nwind's eye.  No advantage, therefore, was given by the pursued, or could\r\nbe taken by the pursuers.  It was a simple question of speed between\r\nhorse, dogs, and game.\r\n\r\nThe dogs gave up first.  They broke down one after another, until only\r\nHendrik's favourite hound kept near.  Another mile's running, and he too\r\nwas used up, and fell to the rear; and now Hendrik galloped alone.\r\n\r\nFor nearly ten miles he galloped, until the sweat streamed from his\r\nhorse's flanks, and the froth from his lips, and still the blesboks\r\nscoured on before him at too great a distance to be reached by his\r\nrifle.  On a fresh horse he could easily have overtaken them now, for\r\nthey ran but slowly.  Perhaps he could have closed upon them as it was,\r\nbut, with all his desire to do so, he was compelled to ride with\r\ncaution.  The burrows of the ant-eater lay in his path, and once or\r\ntwice, as he was closing upon the game with good prospect of getting\r\nnear, his horse had stumbled, and lost ground again.  This gave the\r\nantelopes a decided advantage, as with light hoof they skimmed over\r\nthese impediments without fear.\r\n\r\nAnd still Hendrik was reluctant to pull up.  He thought of the empty\r\nboasting he had made.  He thought of the scornful laugh that would greet\r\nhim on his return.  He thought of Groot Willem!\r\n\r\nIf he could only take back one hide--one pair of horns--all would be\r\nwell.  The laugh would be his.  With such thoughts he had been urged\r\nforward, in this long and desperate ride.\r\n\r\nHe began to despair of success.  The blesboks seemed to run lightly as\r\never, while his horse sprang heavily under him.  The noble brute must\r\nsoon give up.\r\n\r\nHendrik at length felt for him, and would have drawn bridle; but while\r\nhalf-resolved to do so, he noticed a range of mountains directly in\r\nfront of him.  They appeared to extend across the plain transversely to\r\nhis course, or rather two chains met in a sort of angle, quite closing\r\nup the plain in that direction.  Towards this angle the blesboks were\r\ndirecting their course!\r\n\r\nDid they propose taking to the mountain? was the question put by Hendrik\r\nto himself.  If so, he might find an advantage there.  They might come\r\nto a stop, and under cover of the rocks and bushes that grew upon the\r\nmountain-side, he might be able yet to stalk them.\r\n\r\nAs Hendrik reflected thus, his eyes wandered along the base of both\r\nranges from the angle where they met to a good distance on each side.\r\nTo his surprise he perceived that the bases of both ended in a\r\nprecipitous cliff, with no apparent pass leading up!  He was now close\r\nenough to see the cliff.  Not a break appeared along its whole line!\r\n\r\nHendrik was gratified with this discovery.  He was driving the game into\r\nan angle, a very _trap_.  They would be compelled to turn upon him, and\r\nout of such a thick mass, he could not fail to knock over one.  One was\r\nall he wanted.\r\n\r\nHis hopes returned, inspiring him with new vigour; and, uttering a word\r\nof encouragement to his horse, he pushed forward.\r\n\r\nHis ride did not last much longer.  Another mile, and it was over.\r\n\r\nHe had got within five hundred yards of the mountain foot, and less than\r\nhalf that distance from the bucks that still continued to run straight\r\ntoward the angle of the cliffs.  He was now quite sure of a shot.  In\r\nless than a minute, the herd would be compelled either to stop, or turn\r\nback, and meet him in the teeth.\r\n\r\nIt was time to get his rifle in readiness; and as he intended to fire\r\ninto the thick mass, he took several small bullets from his pouch, and\r\nhastily dropped them into the barrel.  He then looked to his\r\npercussion-cap, to make sure that all was right.  It was so.  The copper\r\nwas properly adjusted on the nipple.\r\n\r\nHe cocked his gun, and once more looked forward to the game.  _Not an\r\nantelope was in sight_!\r\n\r\nWhere were they?  Had they sprung up the mountain?  Impossible!  The\r\nprecipice could not be scaled?  Impossible!  Even had they done so, they\r\nwould still have been seen upon the mountain face.  They were not in\r\nsight, not one of them!  The hunter reined up, his gun dropped back to\r\nthe withers of his horse, his jaws fell, and for some moments he sat\r\nwith parted lips, and eyes glaring in wonderment.\r\n\r\nHad he been of a superstitious nature, he might have been troubled with\r\nsome painful feelings at that moment.  But he was not superstitious.\r\nAlthough for a moment or two he could not feel otherwise than astonished\r\nat it, he knew there was some natural cause for the \"sudden and\r\nmysterious disappearance\" of the bucks.\r\n\r\nHe did not pause long in doubt, but proceeded at once to the proper\r\nquarter for an explanation.  The tracks of the herd guided him to that,\r\nand after riding three hundred yards further, the mystery was explained\r\nto his full and complete satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThe angle, after all, was not an angle, for the apex was wanting.  There\r\n_was_ a \"thoroughfare\" without the slightest obstruction.  Although at a\r\nshort distance the converging cliffs appeared to impinge upon each\r\nother, there was an opening between them--a narrow pass that like an\r\nisthmus connected the plain over which the chase had gone, with another\r\nand very similar one that stretched away on the other side of the\r\nmountains.  The blesboks must have known it well enough, else they would\r\nnot have run so direct for the false angle in the cliffs.  Hendrik\r\ntrotted up the pass to convince himself that it was no _cul-de-sac_.\r\nAfter going a few hundred yards, the isthmus widened again, and he saw\r\nto his chagrin the violet backs of the bucks far off upon the plain that\r\nstretched beyond.\r\n\r\nOvercome with disappointment and chagrin, he flung himself from his\r\nsaddle, and staggering a few paces, sat down upon a boulder of rock.  He\r\ndid not even stop to fasten his horse, but, dropping the bridle over his\r\nneck, left the froth-covered and panting steed to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER TWENTY NINE.\r\n\r\nHENDRIK CHASED BY THE KEITLOA.\r\n\r\nHendrik's feelings at that moment were not to be envied.  His\r\nreflections were sharply bitter.  He felt mortified and humiliated.  He\r\nwished he had never set eyes upon a blesbok.  A sorry figure would he\r\ncut on his return to camp.  He had laughed heartily at Hans and Arend.\r\nThey would reciprocate that laugh, and add interest.  He had ridiculed\r\nthe idea of Groot Willem.  Groot would not fail to pay back his scorn.\r\n\r\nBesides, he had done his horse no good; perhaps had injured the animal.\r\nThere stood he, with steaming nostrils and heaving flanks, quite used\r\nup.  They were nearly twelve miles from camp.  He would scarce be able\r\nto carry his rider back, and Hendrik even began to entertain doubts\r\nabout his way.\r\n\r\nThe thought that he might have lost himself was just entering his mind,\r\nwhen his reflections were interrupted by a sound that caused him to\r\nstart up from that rock, as nimbly as he had ever risen from a seat in\r\nhis life.\r\n\r\nThe same sound seemed to produce a very similar effect upon his horse;\r\nfor the latter, on hearing it, suddenly jerked up his drooping head,\r\npricked his ears, snorted loudly, and, after dancing about a moment on\r\ntwo, shot off down the pass at full gallop!\r\n\r\nHendrik's eyes did not follow him, nor his thought neither.  Both were\r\ntoo busy with an animal that came from the opposite side, and which had\r\nuttered the sound that caused such a sudden alarm.  The deep bass snort\r\nand the bellows-like blowing that followed, were no strangers to the ear\r\nof the young hunter.  He knew that, on looking round, he would behold\r\nthe black rhinoceros;--and he did so.  That fierce creature was coming\r\ndown the pass!\r\n\r\nAt first sight Hendrik was not so terribly alarmed.  He had hunted the\r\nrhinoceros more than once, and did not deem it such dangerous sport.  He\r\nhad always been able to avoid the charges of the clumsy quadruped, and\r\nto escape out of its way when he desired.\r\n\r\nBut Hendrik for the moment had forgotten that on such occasions he was\r\nseated, not on a boulder of rock, but in the saddle, and it was to his\r\nhorse that he owed his immunity from danger.\r\n\r\nNow that his horse had run off, and he found himself afoot upon the\r\nplain, with nothing between him and the rhinoceros but twenty yards of\r\nsmooth level turf, he became truly alarmed.  And no wonder at it--his\r\nlife was in danger.\r\n\r\nHis first thought was to run up the rocks, thinking by so doing to get\r\nout of the animal's reach.  But, on looking towards these, he perceived\r\nthat they formed a precipice on both sides of the pass, with a wall-like\r\nface, that could only have been scaled by a cat!  Hendrik could not\r\nclimb up on either side!\r\n\r\nIn the pass itself there was no shelter for him.  Its bottom was a\r\nsmooth sward, sloping but slightly.  It was but the continuation of the\r\nouter plains, that were nearly on the same level.  Here and there stood\r\na tree, but they were small ones--mere \"brush,\" and a rhinoceros could\r\nhave levelled any of them to the ground with his powerful horn.  They\r\noffered no hope, either for concealment or retreat.\r\n\r\nThere appeared no chance of escape in any way.  To attempt it by running\r\noff would be perfectly useless; for Hendrik knew that a rhinoceros could\r\novertake the swiftest runner, as every South African hunter could\r\ntestify.  Hendrik did not think of it.  To add to his ill-fortune, he\r\nhad left his gun strapped to the saddle, and that was now gone off with\r\nthe horse; so that his chance of saving himself by the destruction of\r\nthe rhinoceros was gone also.  The only weapon left him was his\r\nhunting-knife; but what was a knife against the hide of a rhinoceros?\r\nIt might as well have been a needle.\r\n\r\nThere was but one hope of safety; and that was, that the animal might\r\nnot _see_ him.  The rhinoceros possesses the sense of sight only in a\r\nmoderate degree.  His eyes are small; and though sharp enough when an\r\nobject is directly in front of him, they are so placed in his head,\r\nthat, on account of his stiff neck and huge form, he can see nothing\r\neither behind or even at either side of him.\r\n\r\nHendrik had hopes the fierce brute would pass without observing him.\r\nFrom his movements it was evident he had not noticed him as yet, else he\r\nwould already have charged upon him.  The black rhinoceros does not wait\r\nto be provoked.  His own fierce nature furnishes him with sufficient\r\nstimulus, and his fury is habitually directed against creatures the most\r\ninnocent and unoffending.\r\n\r\nTo get as far out of his way as possible, Hendrik glided silently up to\r\nthe cliff, and stood close against the rock.\r\n\r\nBut if the rhinoceros is not a sharp-sighted animal he is one of the\r\nsharpest-scented that lives.  With the wind in his favour, he can smell\r\neven a \"rat\" at an almost incredible distance.  He is also gifted with a\r\nmost acute sense of hearing; and the slightest sound, such as the\r\nrustling of a leaf or the falling of a footstep, will enable him to\r\nguide himself directly to his enemy or his victim.  Were the rhinoceros\r\nendowed with the power of vision to the same degree as he is with that\r\nof smell and hearing, he would be the most dangerous animal in the\r\nworld.  As it is, he is any thing but a safe neighbour, and many of the\r\npoor natives of the country he inhabits, fall victims to his\r\nungovernable temper and brutal strength.  Fortunately his eyes are no\r\nbigger than they are.\r\n\r\nThey were big enough, however, to see Hendrik as he stood, his dark form\r\noutlined against the cliff, and sharp enough to distinguish him from the\r\nrock.  The breeze, indeed, blowing in his spread nostrils, had warned\r\nhim of the hunter's presence, and that had directed his eyes.\r\n\r\nAs these rested upon the form of the boy, he stopped short in his track,\r\nuttered a snorting noise, vibrated his ears, and flirted his saucy\r\nlittle tail over his huge hips.  Then placing himself in a menacing\r\nattitude, and giving utterance to an angry blowing, he dashed forward\r\nupon Hendrik as if the latter had been his enemy for life!\r\n\r\nHendrik's presence of mind was called for at this moment; and it came to\r\nhis aid.  Had he kept his ground five seconds longer, he would have been\r\ncrushed against the rock, or impaled upon the strong horn of the\r\nrhinoceros.  But the moment the latter charged, the boy sprang out from\r\nthe cliff.\r\n\r\nHe did not attempt to run--that would not have saved him; and\r\nfortunately he knew it.  He merely stepped out to the more open ground\r\nin the middle of the pass, and there stood fronting his assailant.  The\r\nlatter having seen the movement, swerved in his course, so as again to\r\nhead direct for his intended victim; and without stopping, rushed\r\nforward as before.\r\n\r\nHendrik stood still, until the sharp black horn almost touched him.\r\nThen bounding to one side, he glided past the rhinoceros, and ran in an\r\nopposite direction.\r\n\r\nHe looked back as he ran; and seeing that the fierce brute had turned\r\nsuddenly on the failure of his charge, and was close at his heels, he\r\nagain made stand, confronting the animal as before.  Again he waited\r\nuntil the rhinoceros was close up, and repeated the manoeuvre of\r\nspringing to one side and running behind.  This Hendrik had heard was\r\nthe only way to escape the rhinoceros in open ground.  Had he sprung\r\naside a moment too soon, that is, before the sudden bound enabled him to\r\nclear the field of the animal's vision, he would certainly have been\r\nfollowed and overtaken; for, unwieldy as the rhinoceros appears, it is\r\nnevertheless far more active than it looks, and the horse can barely get\r\nout of the way of its sudden and impetuous rush.\r\n\r\nHendrik had got two hundred yards down the pass before it turned again,\r\nbut the distance was not enough.  He was compelled to make stand for the\r\nthird time, and await the terrible onset of his huge enemy.\r\n\r\nAs before, he succeeded in getting to his rear, but the rhinoceros\r\nseemed to grow wiser, and now wheeled his body at shorter intervals, so\r\nthat Hendrik's chances of escape were growing less and less after each\r\nsuccessive charge.  In fact, he was kept dodging and leaping\r\ncontinuously from side to side.  To have lost his footings or relaxed\r\nhis vigilance for a moment, would have been certain and immediate\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nHendrik began to despair.  He was already panting for breath, with the\r\nperspiration flowing from every pore.  His body ached with fatigue.  His\r\nlimbs began to fail him.  He could not hold out much longer.  There was\r\nno reason to believe the powerful brute would desist.  It was child's\r\nplay to him; and he had worked himself into a fearful rage at not being\r\nable to strike his victim after so many charges.\r\n\r\nHendrik began to think he was lost for ever.  The thoughts of home, of\r\nfather, of sister, and brothers, of Wilhelmina--rushed across his mind;\r\nhe would never see them more; he would be killed in that pass, and by\r\nthe fierce dark monster that was pursuing him.  They would never know\r\nwhat had become--Ha!  An ejaculation escaped from Hendrik's lips as\r\nthese sad thoughts coursed through his brain.  It was an exclamation of\r\njoy.\r\n\r\nThe struggle between him and the fierce animal had continued for more\r\nthan a quarter of an hour, and had changed from place to place until\r\nthey were now about the middle of the pass.  Hendrik's sudden\r\nexclamation had been caused, by his observing upon the cliffs a sort of\r\nledge or platform about six feet from the ground.  It was scarce that\r\nwidth, but it ran along the front of the cliff for a distance of several\r\nyards; and, as Hendrik thought, at one end there was a sort of cave or\r\ncleft in the rocks.  He scarce glanced at this, however; the platform\r\nitself was what interested him, and without another thought or look he\r\ngrasped the edge of the rock and dragged himself up.\r\n\r\nThe next moment he stood upon the shelf, and looked safely down upon the\r\nferocious brute that was snorting in vain fury below!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY.\r\n\r\nHENDRIK IN A STATE OF SIEGE.\r\n\r\nHendrik breathed freely, though he puffed and panted a long time after\r\ngetting upon his perch.  His mind was at ease, however, for he saw at\r\nonce that the rhinoceros could not reach him.  The most it could do was\r\nto get its ugly snout over the edge of the rock, and that only by\r\nraising itself upon its hind-legs.  This it actually did, blowing with\r\nrage, and projecting its broad muzzle as close as it could to the feet\r\nof the hunter, as if to seize him with its elongated and prehensile\r\nlips.\r\n\r\nIt did so only once.  Hendrik was as angry as the rhinoceros, and with\r\njuster cause; and now, feeling confident of the security of his\r\nposition, he bent forward, and with all his might repeatedly kicked the\r\nthick lips of the brute with the heels of his heavy boots.\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceros danced about, uttering cries of rage and pain; but,\r\ndespite the brutal impetuosity of its nature, it no longer attempted to\r\nscale the cliff, but contented itself with rushing to and fro at its\r\nbase, evidently determined to _lay siege_ to the hunter.\r\n\r\nHendrik had now time to contemplate this singular animal.  To his\r\nsurprise he perceived that it was a new species--that is, one he had\r\nnever seen before, although he had heard of it.\r\n\r\nHendrik knew--for Hans had told him long ago--that there were at least\r\nfour species of the rhinoceros inhabiting the countries of South Africa\r\nbetween the Tropic and the Cape, and that probably a fifth existed to\r\nthe north of this line.  Of the four, two were _white_ rhinoceroses, and\r\ntwo _black_.  The white ones were called respectively \"kobaoba\" and\r\n\"muchocho,\" the black ones \"borele\" and \"keitloa.\"  The white species\r\nwere both larger than the black ones, but of milder disposition.  Their\r\nfood was principally grass, while the borele and keitloa browse upon the\r\ntender shoots and leaves of bushes.  The white ones are \"unicorns,\" that\r\nis, their anterior horn is largely developed--in the muchocho being\r\nsometimes three feet in length, and in the kobaoba still longer--while\r\nthe posterior horn is simply a knob or bony protuberance.  There are\r\nmany other points of distinction between the white and black species,\r\nboth in form, colour, and habits.\r\n\r\nNow, as the one that had attacked Hendrik was a _black_ rhinoceros, and\r\nwas _not_ the borele--for this was the kind they had encountered while\r\nhunting the gnoo--it must be the keitloa.  That it was not the borele\r\nHendrik saw by its horns.  In the latter the front horn only is\r\ndeveloped to any considerable length--never so long as in the white\r\nones--whereas, like with them, the posterior horn is little more than a\r\npointed knob, though longer or shorter in different individuals.  Now,\r\nthe rhinoceros before Hendrik's eyes had two thick strong horns upon its\r\nsnout, each one being full fifteen inches in length, and of course\r\nnearly equal.  The neck, too, was longer, and the lip more pointed and\r\nprehensile than in the borele for Hendrik knew the latter well, as it is\r\none of the most common animals upon the frontier.\r\n\r\nHendrik's assailant was the keitloa.  Although less is known of this\r\nspecies than either the muchocho or borele--because its district lies\r\nfarther to the north--yet Hendrik had heard something of its character\r\nfrom Hans, as well as from old hunters.  He had heard that it is even\r\nmore fierce and dangerous than the borele and is more dreaded by the\r\nnatives.  In districts where it is common, the people fear it more than\r\nany other animal--not even excepting the lion or the grim buffalo!\r\n\r\nHendrik had heard this about the keitloa, and no longer wondered at its\r\nhaving attacked him in the savage and unprovoked manner it had done.  He\r\nonly thanked his stars that there existed that little ledge of rock upon\r\nwhich he now stood, and from which he could look down and contemplate\r\nthose terrible horns with a feeling of complacency which, five minutes\r\nbefore, he had not enjoyed.  He almost laughed at the odd situation he\r\nfound himself in.\r\n\r\n\"What a place for Hans!\" he said in soliloquy.  \"Capital place for him\r\nto study the natural history of this clumsy brute!\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, as if echoing his thoughts, the keitloa began to exhibit\r\nbefore him one of its peculiar habits.\r\n\r\nThere stood a good-sized bush right in front, having a number of\r\nseparate stems growing from one root, the whole forming a little clump\r\nof itself.  Against this bush the rhinoceros commenced battling,--now\r\ncharging it from one side, now from another,--dashing at it\r\nheadforemost, breaking the branches with his horns, and trampling them\r\nunder his thick clumsy limbs--all the while, by his menacing look and\r\nmovements, appearing as if he was fighting with some enemy in earnest!\r\nWhether in earnest or not, he continued to go on in this way for more\r\nthan half-an-hour, until every stem and branch were barked, broken, and\r\ncrushed to mummy among his feet, and not till then did he desist from\r\nhis furious attacks.\r\n\r\nThe whole thing had such a ludicrous air about it that it recalled to\r\nHendrik's mind the story of Don Quixote and the windmill, and set him\r\nlaughing outright.  His merriment, however, was not of long duration,\r\nfor he now began to perceive that the fury of the keitloa was as\r\nlong-lived as it was terrible.  The glances that the animal from time to\r\ntime cast upon the hunter told the latter that he had to deal with an\r\nimplacable enemy.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the creature had finished its battle with the bush, it walked\r\nback towards the cliff, and stood with its head erect and its small\r\nlurid eyes gleaming upon the hunter.  It appeared to know he was its\r\nprisoner, and had resolved upon keeping him there.  Its whole manner\r\nsatisfied Hendrik that such was its intention, and he began once more to\r\nfeel uneasy about the result.\r\n\r\nWhen another hour had passed, and still the keitloa kept watching him\r\nfrom below, he became more than uneasy--he became alarmed.\r\n\r\nHe had been suffering from thirst ever since they commenced hunting the\r\nblesbok--he was now almost choking.  He would have given any thing for\r\none cup of water.\r\n\r\nThe hot sun--for it was yet only noon--scorched him as he stood against\r\nthat bare burning rock.  He suffered torture from heat as well as\r\nthirst.\r\n\r\nHe suffered, too, from suspense.  How long might his implacable sentinel\r\nkeep watch upon him?  Until the keitloa should leave the spot, there was\r\nnot the slightest hope of his escaping.  To have returned to the plain\r\nwould be certain death.  It would have been death but for the timely\r\nproximity of that friendly rock.  No hope to escape from its broiling\r\nsurface so long as the fierce brute remained below.\r\n\r\nWould Hans and the others believe him lost, and follow upon his spoor?\r\nThey might, but not till the next day.  They would not think of him\r\nbeing lost before night came, as it was no unusual thing for one of them\r\nto be off alone from morning till night.  How would he endure the\r\nterrible thirst that was raging within him?  How would he suffer it\r\nuntil they should arrive?\r\n\r\nBesides, it might rain during the night.  His spoor would then be\r\ncompletely obliterated.  They would not be able to follow it, and then,\r\nwhat might be his fate?\r\n\r\nThese and many other reflections passed through his mind as he stood\r\nupon the ledge, regarding his fierce jailer with looks of anger and\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\nBut the keitloa cared not for that.  He still remained upon the ground,\r\nnow pacing to and fro by the bottom of the cliff, and now standing\r\nstill, with head erect, his small dark orbs scintillating with a look of\r\nuntiring vengeance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY ONE.\r\n\r\nA SINGULAR ESCAPE.\r\n\r\nAs the moments passed, Hendrik's thirst grew fiercer, and his impatience\r\nstronger.  He had already examined the cliff above him--in hopes that he\r\nmight have found a way by which it could be scaled.  To no purpose did\r\nhe look up.  There were other ledges, it is true, but they were beyond\r\nhis reach.  The shelf he stood upon ran along the face of the cliff for\r\nmany yards, but narrowed at both ends until it could be followed no\r\nfarther.  He had not moved from the spot where he ascended, as that was\r\nthe broadest part, and where he was most out of reach of the elastic\r\nsnout and long horns of the keitloa.\r\n\r\nHe now remembered that, while battling about below, he had noticed a\r\ndark spot above the ledge, which he had conjectured to be the entrance\r\nof a cave, or a hole in the cliff.  He had thought of it once again, but\r\nas creeping within a cave would not render him more secure than he was\r\nout on the rock, he had not gone towards it.\r\n\r\nNow it occurred to him that he might examine the cave, and enter it if\r\nlarge enough to admit him.  It would, at least, be pleasanter there, as\r\nhe would be sheltered from the hot rays of the sun--an important\r\nconsideration at that moment.\r\n\r\nBut there was another consideration that influenced him still more; and\r\nthat was, the thought that were he once _out of sight_ the rhinoceros\r\n_might forget him_.  He knew that the old adage, \"out of sight, out of\r\nmind,\" had a good deal of meaning when applied to the borele, the lion,\r\nand many other dangerous animals; and perhaps the proverb would also\r\nhold good of the keitloa--though what he had heard of this creature gave\r\nhim very little ground to hope.  At all events, he could test the thing.\r\nIt would not cost much time to make the trial; and even should it prove\r\nof no service in that way, the change from his present stand upon the\r\nhot ledge for a seat within a cool cavern could not otherwise than\r\nbetter his condition.  To the cave then!\r\n\r\nFixing his eye upon the keitloa, he commenced moving along the terrace,\r\ntowards the point where he remembered having noticed the dark fissure in\r\nthe cliff.\r\n\r\nThe keitloa followed, keeping with him step for step; and apparently\r\nroused to fresh vigilance, as if it feared that its victim was about to\r\nattempt an escape.  All the way it followed him; and as the ledge grew\r\nnarrower, it became necessary for Hendrik to proceed with great caution.\r\nNot that he was in danger of falling from it, but rather of _being\r\ndragged_--for the rhinoceros, by standing on his hind-legs, was now able\r\nto stretch his broad muzzle above the edge of the rock, and to protrude\r\nhis elastic snout across the ledge within a few inches of the wall\r\nbeyond.  It therefore required \"gingerly\" stepping on the part of\r\nHendrik.  Notwithstanding all the menacing efforts of his adversary,\r\nHendrik succeeded in reaching the entrance of the cave.\r\n\r\nIt was a cavern deep and dark, with a mouth sufficiently large to admit\r\nthe body of a man in a bent position.\r\n\r\nHendrik was about stooping to enter it, when a loud \"purr\" sounded in\r\nhis ears that caused him to start erect again, as if some one had run a\r\nneedle into his back!  The \"purr\" was quickly followed by a \"roar,\" so\r\ndeep and terrible, that in his first moments of alarm, the hunter felt\r\nhalf inclined to leap to the ground, and risk the horns of the\r\nrhinoceros, which, at that instant, were gleaming above the ledge,\r\nwithin twenty inches of his feet!\r\n\r\nThere was no mystery in what caused the alarm.  There was no mistaking\r\nthat roar for any other earthly sound.  The cave was tenanted by a lion!\r\n\r\nThe tenant did not remain much longer within his house.  The roaring\r\ncontinued; and every moment sounded nearer and clearer.  The huge claws\r\ncaused a rattling among the dry pebbles that strewed the bottom of the\r\ncave.  The lion was coming forth!\r\n\r\nWith the nimbleness of a klipspringer, Hendrik bounded to one side, and\r\nran back along the ledge, looking fearfully behind him.\r\n\r\nThis time he was not followed by the keitloa.  The rhinoceros, whether\r\nterrified by the roar of the lion, or whether his attention was solely\r\ntaken up by it, remained standing where he had taken up his position,\r\nwith his head projected over the rock, and his snout pointed towards the\r\nentrance of the cavern.\r\n\r\nNext moment the shaggy front of the lion filled the mouth of the cave,\r\nand the king of beasts and the \"king of brutes\" came face to face!\r\n\r\nFor some moments they remained gazing at each other; but the eyes of the\r\nlion seemed to intimidate the keitloa, and the latter drew his head\r\nback, and dropped on all fours to the ground.  Perhaps he would have\r\ngone off from the spot without an encounter; but the ire of the dread\r\nmonarch had been aroused by this intrusion upon his rest.  For a moment\r\nhe stood lashing his tawny sides with his tail; and then, crouching\r\nuntil his breast touched the rock, he launched himself out from the\r\nledge, and came down with all the weight of his body upon the broad back\r\nof the keitloa!\r\n\r\nBut, king as he was, he had mistaken the character of that \"subject,\" if\r\nhe thought he was going either to mangle him badly, or put him to\r\nflight.  Sharp as were his claws, and strong his arms to strike, they\r\nbarely scratched the thick hard hide of the pachyderm; and although he\r\ntried to \"fix\" himself on the shoulders of the latter, he could not\r\nmanage to stick.  Had it been a buffalo, or an antelope, or even the\r\ntall giraffe, he would have ridden it to death; but to ride a rhinoceros\r\nwas a different affair; and he found it so.  Although he used both teeth\r\nand claws to keep him in the position he had taken, neither would serve\r\nhim, and he was dismounted almost in an instant.  The moment the keitloa\r\nfelt the fierce rider on its back, it made a desperate rush outward from\r\nthe rocks, and shaking its huge body like an earthquake, it cast the\r\nlion to the plain.\r\n\r\nThe lion crouched as if again to spring; but the latter, suddenly\r\nturning upon his antagonist, stood face to face with him before he could\r\neffect his purpose.\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceros did not pause a moment, but rushed on his antagonist with\r\nhis horns set like couched lances.  The weight of his body, with the\r\nimpetuosity of the charge, would have driven those hard sharp weapons\r\nthrough the toughest skin that lion ever wore, and through his ribs as\r\nwell.  The lion seemed to be troubled with some such idea; for, instead\r\nof awaiting the onset of his enemy, he turned tail--the cowardly\r\nbrute!--and made off up the pass, the keitloa chasing him as if he had\r\nbeen a cat!\r\n\r\nHendrik, all the while, had watched the combat from the ledge; but he\r\nnever knew how it ended, or whether the rhinoceros overtook the lion or\r\nnot.  The moment he saw the two great brutes in full run _up_ the pass,\r\nhe leaped from the ledge and ran _down_ it, with all the speed he could\r\ntake out of his legs.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the angle, he hesitated a moment which way to take--whether\r\nto follow back the spoor of the hunt, or the later tracks of his horse--\r\nbut at length he decided on following back his own spoor over the open\r\nplain.  He ran along it as fast as he was able, looking over his\r\nshoulders at very short intervals, and still fearful that the great\r\nblack body would show itself in his rear.  He was agreeably\r\ndisappointed, however.  No keitloa followed in pursuit; and soon another\r\nagreeable fact came under his notice--he perceived that his horse had\r\nalso gone back the same way.  On rounding a clump of bushes some\r\ndistance farther on, he saw the horse browsing a little way off upon the\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nThe latter permitted himself to be caught; and Hendrik, once more\r\nmounting to the saddle, pursued his way towards the camp.  The spoor of\r\nthe hunt guided him in a direct line; for the blesboks, it will be\r\nremembered, ran all the while to windward, thus following a straight\r\ncourse.  Hendrik had no difficulty in following the track; and, after\r\ntwo hours' riding, got back to camp, having picked up most of the dogs\r\non his way back.\r\n\r\nHans and Arend _did_ laugh at him.  Groot Willem did _not_.  The latter\r\nremembered how his rival had acted after his own tumble over the burrow\r\nof the aard-wolf; and now reciprocated Hendrik's handsome behaviour on\r\nthat occasion.  Groot Willem and Hendrik were likely to become great\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY TWO.\r\n\r\nA VAST HERD OF ANTELOPES.\r\n\r\nNext day the young yagers were witnesses to a most extraordinary\r\nspectacle; and that was, a vast herd of blesboks,--so vast, that the\r\nplains appeared literally covered with their purple masses!\r\n\r\nThis herd was not browsing, nor at rest, but scouring up against the\r\nwind--as those hunted the day before had done--and evidently running as\r\nif some dreaded enemy in their rear had given them an alarm.\r\n\r\nThe mass of bodies was nearly half a mile in width; but it would have\r\nbeen difficult to estimate its length, as it continued to pass before\r\nthe eyes of the yagers for more than an hour!  On the animals poured,\r\nsometimes running in line, and sometimes the hindmost leaping over those\r\nthat preceded them, moving like an impetuous torrent.  All of them ran\r\nwith necks extended forward, their noses close to the ground, like\r\nhounds running upon the scent!\r\n\r\nHere and there they were closely packed in dense masses, while in the\r\nintervals between, the bucks were thinly interspersed; and now and then\r\nwere wide breaks, like an army marching in column.\r\n\r\nThe cause of these openings was simply that the immense drove consisted\r\nof a great many separate herds, all running by one impulse; for it is a\r\ncurious habit of the blesboks and bonteboks, that when one herd becomes\r\nalarmed, all the other herds that chance to be in the same plains with\r\nthis one, both to windward and leeward of it, start off in succession;\r\nand as all, from their habit of running up the wind, must follow the\r\nsame direction, a constant drove, or rather a continuous succession of\r\ndroves is formed, and passes in open column before the spectator who may\r\nbe on either flank.  The wonderful spectacle of so many living\r\ncreatures, running together in such countless numbers, brought to mind\r\nthe accounts, which the young yagers had read, of the migrations of the\r\nbuffalo on the prairies of America, and also those of the\r\npassenger-pigeon.  Of course, the resemblance to the \"trek-boken\" of\r\ntheir own springboks, which all of them had witnessed, was also\r\nremembered.\r\n\r\nOn this day our hunters were more successful than upon the preceding.\r\nThey had learnt by their experience of yesterday how to \"jag\" the\r\nblesbok.\r\n\r\nInstead of attempting either to \"stalk\" or \"head\" them, they found that\r\nthe best plan was to ride along the flanks of the running herd, and now\r\nand again dash near enough to fire into the thick of them.  The\r\nblesboks, while moving to windward, will permit the hunter to get within\r\nthree or four hundred yards of their flank; and the mounted hunter,\r\nkeeping his horse fresh, can now and then gallop within shooting\r\ndistance before the moving mass can turn out of its course.  Firing\r\namong a flock in this aimless way, the bullet is not always sure of a\r\nvictim, but now and then a buck fells to the shot.\r\n\r\nPractising this plan, the young yagers played upon the flanks of the\r\ngreat herd during the whole time of its flight to windward; but\r\nnotwithstanding the continuous cracking of rifles, with now and then the\r\nlouder detonation of Groot Willem's great elephant-gun, the slaughter\r\nwas not very great.  Six only \"bit the dust.\"  But as in the six there\r\nchanced to be an equal number of bucks and does, the hunters were quite\r\ncontent.  They were not \"jaging\" for the meat, but merely to get\r\nspecimens of the horns and prettily-painted skins; and three of each\r\nwere as many as they wanted.\r\n\r\nThe hunt was soon over; and as their horses were pretty well \"blown,\"\r\nthe yagers returned at an early hour to camp, taking with them only the\r\nheads, horns, and skins of their game, with just enough of the venison\r\nto give them fresh steaks for a day or two.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity they remarked in skinning the blesboks--that the skins\r\nof these beautiful creatures exhaled a pleasant perfume--arising, no\r\ndoubt, from the fragrant plants and herbage upon which the animals feed.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon was spent in dressing the skins--by removing the fatty\r\nflesh that adheres to them--and they were then spread out to dry.  Under\r\nsuch a hot sun, a few hours was sufficient to render them dry enough to\r\nbe carried on to the next camp, where they would be spread out for a\r\nlonger period, and thoroughly prepared for packing in the wagons.\r\n\r\nHendrik and Groot Willem performed this service; but the preparing of\r\nthe heads--a more scientific operation--was the work of Hans assisted by\r\nArend.  Hans had his box of chemicals, consisting of arsenical soap and\r\nseveral other noted \"preservers,\" which he had brought along for this\r\nspecial purpose; and by night, two pairs of heads, with the skin and\r\nhorns attached, were thoroughly cleaned and mounted, and ready for\r\nnailing up to the wall.\r\n\r\nThere was a buck and doe in each pair; one, of course, for the Von\r\nBlooms, and another for the mansion of the Van Wyks.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between the horns of the _blaze-buck_ and the\r\n_blaze-doe_ is, that those of the latter are shorter, and more slender;\r\nwhile the skin of the doe is less vivid in its colouring, and smaller,\r\nas is also the body of the animal.  The same remark applies to the\r\nkindred species--the bonteboks--of which brilliantly coloured creatures\r\nfull sets of horns and skins were obtained the day after.\r\n\r\nOn this occasion, the \"stand and drive\" recommended by Groot Willem had\r\nbeen tried again, and with great success; each of the four--Hans,\r\nHendrik, Arend, and Groot himself--having shot his buck as the flock\r\ndashed up to their stands.  Indeed, Hans, upon this occasion, had\r\ncarried off the palm.  His double-barrel, loaded with ball, had enabled\r\nhim to knock over a couple of the \"painted goats\"--as bonteboks are\r\nsometimes styled--right and left.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of their success in this hunt, and their failure when\r\ntrying the same plan with the blesboks, is not found in any essential\r\ndifference between the two species.  Their habits are almost the same.\r\n\r\nNo.  Their success lay simply in the fact, that on the day when they\r\njaged the bontebok, there was no wind--not a breath of air stirring.  On\r\nthis account the game were not only unable to run against the wind, but,\r\nkeen as is their scent, they were not able to tell behind which ant-hill\r\nlay their concealed enemies.\r\n\r\nThe consequence was, that Klaas and Jan were able to drive them right up\r\nto the ambushed hunters, who slew them without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe \"stalk\" would not have succeeded on such a day, for these antelopes\r\ntrust far more to their nose than their eyes; moreover, a correct\r\nrifle-shot is very difficult to be obtained in the plains of the\r\n\"zuur-veldt,\"--as the _mirage_ is almost always upon them, and\r\ninterferes with the aim.  So strong is this mirage, that objects at a\r\ndistance become quite distorted to the eye, and out of all proportion.\r\nA secretary bird stalking along looks as big as a man, and an ostrich\r\nattains the altitude of a church-steeple.  Even the colour of objects\r\nbecomes changed; and travellers have mistaken a pair of tawny lions for\r\nthe white tilts of their own wagons and have gone towards them, thinking\r\nthey were riding into their camp!  An awkward mistake, I should fancy.\r\n\r\nAfter having secured their specimens of the pied antelopes, the young\r\nyagers again broke up camp, and treked away across the plains of the\r\n\"zuur-veldt.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY THREE.\r\n\r\nTHE LONE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nIt has been observed, that upon the plains of the zuur-veldt country,\r\nmountains of singular forms meet the eye of the traveller--cones, domes,\r\nsquare box-like masses with table tops; sharp ridges, like the roofs of\r\ngigantic houses; and some that pierce the heavens with pointed peaks\r\nlike the steeples of churches!  Some, again, present a horizontal\r\noutline, like the parapet of a fortification, while square tower-like\r\nmasses, rising above the general level, carry out the idea of some work\r\nof military architecture on a grand scale.\r\n\r\nOur young yagers were very much interested in these mountain forms, so\r\nvaried and fantastic.  Sometimes their route led them along the base of\r\na precipice rising a thousand feet sheer above the plain, and trending\r\nfor miles without a break, so that for miles no access could be had to\r\nthe mountain that rose still higher above.  Sometimes they were\r\ncompelled to trek along narrow ridges that sloped off on both sides,\r\nleaving scarce enough of level to run the wheels upon.  Then, again,\r\nthey would be compelled to pass around some spur, that, shooting for\r\nmiles out into the plain, barred their direct path.\r\n\r\nAs they treked across one of the widest plains they had yet seen, a\r\nsingularly formed mountain drew their attention.  It could scarce be\r\ncalled a mountain, as its altitude above the plain could not have been\r\nmore than seven or eight hundred feet; but its brown rocky surface gave\r\nit that character, and to have styled such a mass a hill would have been\r\nequally misnaming it.  There were no \"foothills,\" or inequalities near\r\nits base.  The greensward of the level plain stretched away on every\r\nside--its verdant colour strongly contrasting with the dark brown\r\ngranite of the mountain.\r\n\r\nThe sides of this singular mountain sloped from base to summit as\r\nregularly as those of an Egyptian pyramid; and at a distance it looked\r\npyramidal, but on coming nearer its rounded form could be perceived.  It\r\nwas, in reality, an obtuse cone, perfect in all except the apex, and it\r\nwas there that the peculiarity of this mountain lay.  Instead of ending\r\nat the apex, a steeple-like rock rose out of the summit some thirty feet\r\nhigher, ending in a point that appeared from below as \"sharp as a\r\nneedle.\"  It was this that had drawn the attention of the young yagers\r\nmore particularly, as other mountains of conical form were common enough\r\nalong their route; but this one, looking, as one of them observed, like\r\nan inverted funnel, differed from any they had yet seen.  It was very\r\nconspicuous, thus standing isolated in the midst of the open plain, and\r\ncontrasting so much in its colour with the green table upon which it\r\nappeared to rest.\r\n\r\n\"Let us go and explore it,\" proposed Arend; \"it isn't much out of our\r\nway.  We can easily overtake these slow-going oxen again.  What say ye\r\nall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go, by all means,\" said Hans, who fancied that upon so\r\nodd-looking a mountain he might fall in with some new plant.\r\n\r\n\"Agreed!\" cried all the others in a breath, for when Hans proposed a\r\nthing it was usually assented to by his younger comrades.\r\n\r\nWithout further ado the whole six turned their horses' heads for the\r\nmountain, leaving the wagons to trek on across the plain, towards the\r\npoint where they intended to encamp.\r\n\r\nWhen the riders first faced to the mountain, it appeared to be about a\r\nmile off, and all, except Hans, believed that it was not more.  Hans\r\nmaintained that it was _five_, and was unanimously contradicted.  A\r\ndiscussion took place, Hans standing alone--five to one against him.\r\nThe idea of its being more than a mile was scouted.  Hans was\r\nridiculed--laughed at--called blind.\r\n\r\nThere was a little epitome of the world on that plain--a paraphrase upon\r\na small scale of Galileo and his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nAnd here let me counsel you, boy reader, ever to be cautious how you\r\npronounce against ideas that may be put forth, because they chance to\r\ndiffer from those you already hold.  Half of what you have already\r\nlearnt is erroneous, and much of it has been taught you with an evil\r\nintent.  I do not refer to what has been taught you by your school\r\ninstructor, who imparts knowledge to you with the best of motives.  But\r\nthe tyrants of the earth--both priests and princes--for long centuries\r\nhave had the moulding of men's minds, and they have spared no labour to\r\nshape them to their own purposes.  They have so well succeeded, that one\r\nhalf the _very proverbs_ by which conduct is guided, prove upon\r\nexamination to be false and wicked.\r\n\r\nThere is a peculiarity about the attainment of knowledge which assists\r\nwicked men in misleading their victims, and I would wish that all of you\r\nshould know this peculiarity.  I do not claim to be its discoverer, for\r\nothers may have discovered it as well; but up to this hour I have met\r\nwith no promulgation of it.\r\n\r\nIt is this, that _every truth is overshadowed by a sophism, more like\r\nthe truth than truth itself_.  This law holds good throughout the whole\r\nextent of the moral, intellectual, and material world.\r\n\r\nI cannot pause here to illustrate the above statement--not even to\r\nexplain it.  But I hope the day is not distant, when you and I may\r\nconverse upon such matters _face to face_.\r\n\r\nI hope you believe that I have helped you to some knowledge; but I now\r\naffirm, and in full seriousness, that, if you examine the statement I\r\nhave thus emphatically made, and _study it to a full understanding_, you\r\nwill have gained more knowledge in that one sentence than all I have\r\nhitherto written.  You will find in it the key to most of the errors and\r\nmisfortunes that afflict mankind.\r\n\r\nIn that sentence you will also find a key to the difference of opinion\r\nthat existed between Hans and his five companions.  None of the five\r\nwere _thinkers_--they relied entirely on the evidence of their senses.\r\nA process of ratiocination never troubled the brain of any of the five.\r\nHad they never before seen a straight rod plunged into crystal water,\r\nthey would most certainly have believed that the rod was bent into an\r\nangle--ay, and have ridiculed any one who should have contradicted the\r\n_evidence of their senses_, just in the way they now ridiculed Hans for\r\nasserting that an object was five miles off, when they _plainly saw_ it\r\nwas only a fifth part of that distance.  It certainly _appeared_ only a\r\nmile off--that is, to one who had been in the habit of measuring\r\ndistances by the eye in the ordinary atmosphere of a lowland country.\r\nBut Hans knew they were now in a region elevated many thousand feet\r\nabove the level of the sea.  Partly from books, and partly from his own\r\nobservation, he had studied the nature of the atmosphere at that\r\naltitude; and he was acquainted with the optical illusions of which it\r\nis frequently the cause.  He admitted that the mountain _looked_ near,\r\neven as near as a mile; but he held on to his original opinion.\r\n\r\nPatient as was the young philosopher, the ridicule of his companions\r\nnettled him a little; and suddenly pulling up on the plain, he\r\nchallenged them to a measurement.  They all agreed to the proposal.\r\nThey had no measuring chain--not even a yardstick.\r\n\r\nBut they knew that Hans could tell distances without one; and having\r\nconsented that his measurement should be taken, they all rode back to\r\nthe point where the discussion had commenced.\r\n\r\nHow was Hans going to manage it?  By trigonometrical triangles, you will\r\nsay.  Not a bit of it.  He could have told the distance in that way if\r\nhe had wished; but he had a simpler plan.  Hans did not carry a\r\n_viameter_, but a _viameter_ carried him!\r\n\r\nYes, in the stout steady-going cob which he rode, he had as perfect a\r\nviameter as ever was set to a wheel; and Hans having once put his horse\r\nto the proper pace, could tell the distance passed over almost as\r\ncorrectly as if it had been traced by a chain!  There was a certain rate\r\nof speed into which Hans's horse, when left to himself, was sure to\r\nfall, and this speed was so many steps to the minute--the steps being of\r\nequal length.  By either counting the steps, or noting the time, the\r\nexact distance could be obtained.\r\n\r\nHans had been in the habit of putting his horse to the proper pace for\r\nthis very purpose, and could do so at a minute's warning.  So, taking\r\nout his watch to regulate the speed by the moment hand, he started\r\nforward in a direct line for the mountain.\r\n\r\nAll rode, after, without noise--so as not to disturb Hans in his\r\ncounting.  But for that, they would have continued to gibe him a little.\r\nOnly for a short while, however; for, as they rode on, and the mountain\r\ndid not appear to _come_ any nearer, their faces began to look very\r\nblank indeed.\r\n\r\nWhen they had ridden for a full half-hour, and the mountain _still\r\nlooked a mile off_, Hans had five very crest-fallen boys moving along in\r\nhis rear.\r\n\r\nWhen they had ridden nearly another half-hour, and their horses' snouts\r\nalmost touched the rocks of the mountain, none of the five was surprised\r\nto hear Hans cry out in a loud firm voice:--\r\n\r\n\"Just five miles and a quarter!\"\r\n\r\nNot a word was spoken.  Not one of the five ventured even a whisper of\r\ncontradiction.  Hans did not laugh in his turn, but facing round simply\r\nsaid--\r\n\r\n\"_Every truth is overshadowed by a sophism more like the truth than\r\ntruth itself_!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FOUR.\r\n\r\nTHE APPROACH TO THE LONE MOUNTAIN.\r\n\r\nAlthough from a distance the mountain had appeared of smooth outlines,\r\nnow, that they gazed upward from its base, it presented quite a\r\ndifferent aspect.  Loose boulders of rock, strewed thickly upon the\r\nslope, covered its sides up to the very summit, giving it the appearance\r\nof a gigantic \"cairn,\" such as may be seen upon the tops of some of our\r\nown mountains.  These, however, are the work of men, while that upon\r\nwhich our yagers gazed looked as though giants had erected it.\r\n\r\nAmong the loose stones there was yet a trace of vegetable life.  Plants\r\nof the cactus kind, and rare euphorbias, grow in the spaces between the\r\nrocks; and here and there stood a small tree, with spreading top and\r\nmyrtle-like foliage, casting its shadow over the side of the mountain.\r\nThe arborescent aloe was also seen, its coral-red spike appearing above\r\nthe sharp edge of some huge boulder, and strongly contrasting with the\r\ndull grey of the rock.\r\n\r\nAfter contemplating the singular eminence for some minutes, it was\r\nproposed that they should all ascend to its summit.  It appeared but a\r\nvery short way.  The path was not very steep.  A ten minutes' climb\r\nwould suffice.  What a splendid view they should have from its top!  It\r\ncommanded a prospect of the country they were about to traverse for the\r\nnext three days' journey at least.  They might lay out their course from\r\nit, and by noting landmarks, avoid the detours of mountain-spurs and\r\nother obstacles.  Should they ascend it?\r\n\r\nYes.  All of them desired to do so--some to enjoy the view; some for the\r\nfun of climbing; and Klaas and Jan because they had seen a large bird\r\nwheeling around the summit, which might be the king of birds--an eagle;\r\nand they wished to make a nearer acquaintance with his majesty.\r\n\r\nHans also had an interest in going up.  He wanted to examine the\r\nvegetation of the mountain--that appeared to differ essentially from\r\nthat of the surrounding plain--and particularly the myrtle-leaved tree\r\nalready mentioned.\r\n\r\nSo the voice for making the ascent was unanimous--_nemine dissentiente_.\r\n\r\nWithout further ado, they all dismounted--for it would have been\r\nimpossible to have ridden up such a rock-strewed path--and secured their\r\nhorses by tying their bridles together.  This was their usual way when\r\nthere was no tree to which they could make them fast.  The mode answered\r\nwell enough.  The animals were well acquainted, and on friendly terms,\r\nso that they did not bite or kick one another; and with their noses all\r\nturned inward, no one of them could stray off without the consent of the\r\nother five, and this unanimity could never be obtained.  Even had five\r\nof them agreed to wander a bit, there was one that would have opposed\r\nsuch a conspiracy, and _pulled against it_ with all his might--one that\r\nwould have remained loyal to his master; and that was Hans's steady,\r\nsober-sided cob, that had been trained to wait wherever his rider left\r\nhim.  Upon many a botanical excursion had he carried his master, and\r\noften had stood with no other fastening than the bridle thrown over his\r\nwithers, while the botanist climbed the rocky steep, or dived into the\r\nthick bush, to pluck some rare plant or flower.\r\n\r\nLeaving their horses, the party commenced the ascent.  Now their path\r\nlay between large masses of granite, and now passed over the tops of the\r\nrocks.  It required them to use all their strength and agility; and\r\nalthough from below they fancied they would reach the summit in about\r\nfive minutes time, they were sadly disappointed.\r\n\r\nThere are few things more deceptive than the ascent of a mountain.  It\r\nis usually more difficult than it appears, and a large allowance should\r\nbe made in the calculation, both for time and labour.  The philosopher\r\nHans knew this very well, and told the others that it would take them a\r\nfull half-hour to get to the top.  Some of them were inclined to\r\nridicule his assertion; but they remembered their late humiliating\r\ndefeat, and remained silent--although they _thought_ five minutes would\r\nbring them to the very summit.\r\n\r\nAt the end of five minutes they began to change their opinion; and when\r\nthree times five had passed over, they found they were still but\r\nhalf-way up the slope!\r\n\r\nHere they halted, and five minutes were spent in \"puffing and blowing.\"\r\n\r\nHans had now an opportunity of examining the tree that so interested\r\nhim, for they had stopped under the shade of one.\r\n\r\nIt was not a large tree, nor could it be called a very handsome one; but\r\nfor all that it proved to be of a most interesting character.  It was\r\nmuch branched with small leaves, of a pale green colour, and in their\r\ngeneral effect having a resemblance to the myrtles.  Its flowers, too,\r\nwere small and inconspicuous.  It chanced to be in flower at the time,\r\nand this enabled the botanist to determine its character.  It belonged\r\nto the order _Santalaceae_, or \"sandal-woods;\" and was a species of\r\n_Santalum_, closely allied to the _Santalum album_ of India, which\r\nyields the sandal-wood of commerce.\r\n\r\nThey all knew what sandal-wood was, as they had seen various\r\n\"knick-knacks\" manufactured out of this famous wood; but they knew not\r\nwhence it came, or what sort of tree produced it.  Hans, however, taking\r\nadvantage of the halt, gave them this information:--\r\n\r\n\"The sandal-wood,\" he said, \"is produced from a tree of the same genus\r\nas the one now above us.  It grows in the mountainous parts of the\r\nMalabar country, and also in the islands of the Indian Archipelago.  It\r\nis a small tree, rarely growing to a foot in diameter.  Its wood, as you\r\nknow, is highly prized on account of its agreeable fragrant smell; and\r\nbecause this fragrance not only keeps it from decaying, but also\r\npreserves any material, such as clothes, silk, and other articles that\r\nmay be in contact with it, from insects or rust.  In consequence of this\r\nquality of the sandal-wood, it is in great demand for making boxes,\r\ncabinets, and such articles of furniture; and, on account of its\r\nagreeable odour, it is also manufactured into fans and necklaces which\r\ncommand high prices.\r\n\r\n\"The Brahmins use it in their sacrifices to the god Vishnu, to scent the\r\noil employed in the ceremony.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are there not two kinds of sandal-wood?\" inquired Klaas.  \"Sister\r\nWilhelmina has a box of it and a necklace, too.  They were brought from\r\nIndia by Uncle, but they are very different.  The box is white, and the\r\nbeads of the necklace are of a beautiful yellow colour--maybe they are\r\ndyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Hans, \"they are not dyed.  There _are_ two kinds, white\r\nsandal-wood and the yellow sort, and it has been said that they were the\r\nproduce of different trees.  This is not the case, however.  Although\r\nthere is more than one species of _Santalum_ that produces the\r\nsandal-wood of commerce, the white and yellow kinds are taken from the\r\nsame tree.  The reason of the difference is, that towards the heart of\r\nthe tree where the wood is older, and especially down near the root, the\r\ncolour is of a deep yellow; whereas the young wood that lies outwardly\r\nis nearly white.  The yellow part is harder, more fragrant, and, of\r\ncourse, more valuable.\r\n\r\n\"When these trees are felled for their wood, the bark is at once\r\nstripped off and the trunk buried for nearly two months--which\r\nstrengthens its odour, and renders it more agreeable.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Hans was giving these interesting details, the others took out\r\ntheir knives; and each cutting a branch from the sandal-tree, applied it\r\nto his nose, and then tasted it.\r\n\r\nBut, though they could perceive its fragrant smell, they found it\r\nperfectly insipid to the taste.  Hans said it was so with the _Santalum\r\nalbum_ or true sandal-wood of India--that, notwithstanding its sweet\r\nperfume, it is quite tasteless.\r\n\r\nHe further informed them that the name \"sandal-wood\" is not derived from\r\nthe use to which the wood is sometimes put--that of making _sandals_.\r\nOn the contrary, these derive their name from the wood itself.  The true\r\nderivation of the word is from the Persian \"sandul,\" which signifies\r\nuseful, in relation to the valuable qualities of the timber.  The\r\nsandal-wood of the Sandwich Islands, added Hans, is procured from two\r\nspecies different from _Santalum album_.\r\n\r\nThe yagers, having now rested a sufficient time, again faced up the\r\nmountain, and in fifteen minutes after stood upon its top.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE HYRAX.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite correct to say that they stood upon the summit.  They\r\nhad reached the top of the hill, but still above them rose the\r\nsteeple-like rock which they had observed from the plain, and whose odd\r\nappearance had allured them to the spot.\r\n\r\nA singular rock it was, rising full thirty feet above the summit of the\r\nmountain.  Its sides were nearly vertical, but scored and seamed as if\r\nthe rain had worn its surface into furrows.  It gradually narrowed\r\nupward, until it ended in a point not four inches in diameter; but along\r\nits sides from top to bottom similar points stood up; so that the whole\r\nstructure--if we may call it so--bore a strong resemblance to a Gothic\r\nturret, rising in the midst of many others that stood out from its base\r\nand along its sides.\r\n\r\nIt appeared inaccessible to any other creature than a cat, a monkey, or\r\na winged bird; and of course not one of the party thought of such a\r\nthing as climbing it.  That would have been a perilous undertaking.\r\n\r\nAfter they had satisfied themselves in gazing at this singular\r\ngeological phenomenon, they commenced moving around its base to the\r\nopposite side.  It was not so easy to get round it, as huge sharp\r\nboulders covered the whole scarp of the hill around its base, and they\r\nhad either to mount over these, or push themselves through the narrow\r\ninterstices between.\r\n\r\nBefore they had got quite round, however, an object came under their\r\neyes that caused them to halt, and remain for some time in an attitude\r\nof observation.\r\n\r\nAbout half-way down the hill rested a rock of vast dimensions, whose\r\nsharp angular top rose higher than those around, and commanded the view\r\nof a broad space of the mountain-side.  Upon the top of this rock was\r\nperched a very large bird--full as large as a turkey-cock.  Its plumage\r\nwas of a deep black colour, except over the back, where there was a\r\npatch as white as snow covering the shoulders.  The feathers upon the\r\nlegs reached to the very toes, and were of brown colour.  The toes\r\nappearing beneath were of a bright yellow.\r\n\r\nThe general outline of its form--the abrupt curving of the beak--the\r\nfull-rounded tail--the strong broad wings, and the feathered legs\r\nlooking as though the bird wore _trowsers_--were all characteristic\r\npoints that told its species.\r\n\r\n\"An eagle!\" exclaimed the hunters as soon as they saw it.\r\n\r\nIt was an eagle, and one of the largest of its kind.  It was the great\r\nvulture-eagle of Verreaux, (_Aquila Verreauxii_).  This bird no doubt it\r\nwas that Klaas and Jan had caught a glimpse of as they approached the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\nIt was scarce two hundred yards from the boys, and although they had\r\nbeen making a considerable noise while passing over the rocks, it had\r\nnot heard them, and still sat without noticing their proximity.  That\r\nwould have been strange for a bird so shy as an eagle; but it was\r\naccounted for by the fact that its attention at the moment seemed to be\r\ntaken up with something else.  This was evident from the attitude in\r\nwhich it sat, or rather stood, with claws firmly clenched upon the edge\r\nof the rock, and neck stretched forward and downward.  It was evidently\r\neyeing some object below, in which it took a deep interest.\r\n\r\nIts back was turned upon the hunters, and offered a fair mark; but it\r\nwas far beyond point-blank range of any of their guns, except perhaps\r\nthe roer.  Groot Willem, however, might have reached it, but at such a\r\ndistance and with so small a mark a bullet from the smooth bore would\r\nhave been little better than a chance shot.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem was about to try it, however; but Hans begged of him to\r\nhold his fire a little longer, so that they might watch the movements of\r\nthe eagle--which, from its odd attitude, was evidently meditating to\r\nsurprise some victim below.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the victim was also in sight--appearing suddenly\r\nupon a little terrace, some twenty or thirty yards farther down the\r\nmountain.  It was a small quadruped, of a greyish brown colour, darker\r\nabove, and of lighter tint beneath.  It had the look of a rabbit, though\r\nconsiderably larger than one, thicker in the body, and without the long\r\nears.  It stood, moreover, not so high on its legs, and these appeared\r\nmuch bent as it walked.  Like the rabbit, its hair was of a thick woolly\r\nnature, though long scattered silky hairs rose above the general surface\r\nof its furry coat it was entirely without a tail; and the four claws of\r\nits fore feet were _not_ claws, but nails resembling little hoofs?  On\r\nthe hind-feet it had but three toes; the inside one of each ending in a\r\nregular claw.\r\n\r\nOf course, these peculiarities were not noticed by the spectators at the\r\nmoment, as the little quadruped was beyond the reach of such minute\r\nobservation.  They were communicated afterwards by Hans, who knew the\r\nanimal well.\r\n\r\nAltogether it was by no means an interesting animal to look at\r\nexternally; yet in its internal structure it was one of the most\r\ninteresting upon the globe.\r\n\r\nIn that small round woolly creature, timid as a mouse--now making abrupt\r\nruns across the little platform--now stopping short in its career, to\r\nnibble a leaf of some plant, or to look suspiciously around--in that\r\ninsignificant quadruped the young yagers beheld a near relative of the\r\nbig brutal rhinoceros!  Yes; though without any horn upon its snout, and\r\nwithout the naked skin--the teeth, the skull, the ribs, the hoof-like\r\ntoes, the whole internal structure of the animal in question, prove it\r\nto be a rhinoceros!--a regular pachyderm!  So says Frederick Cuvier.\r\n\r\n\"What a wonderful triumph,\" said Hans, \"the closet naturalists have had\r\nin this discovery!  `What a triumph of anatomy,' says M. Cuvier, `that\r\nproves this supposed rodent to be a rhinoceros!'  In my opinion it is\r\nrather a proof of the weakness of M. Cuvier's anatomic theories; for\r\nhere is a creature, with all the _teeth_ of a rhinoceros, and all the\r\n_manners_ of a rabbit!\r\n\r\n\"Instead of the bold brutal nature of the rhinoceros--rushing out\r\nwithout provocation, attacking and butting at whatever comes in its\r\nway--here we have a shy timid creature, that takes to flight on the\r\nslightest suspicion of danger, and seems to be frightened at its very\r\nshadow.  Why, it affords the most absolute proof of the uncertainty of\r\nthe _teeth_ and _bones_ as a guide to the mode of life of any animal.\r\nIn all animated nature a better illustration could not be found of the\r\nfallacy of M. Cuvier's arguments than this same _hyrax_--for so the\r\nquadruped is called--and, despite the opinion of the celebrated French\r\nsavant, I still believe the little creature to be more of a rabbit than\r\na rhinoceros.\"  So spoke Hans Von Bloom.  It was bold language for so\r\nyoung a naturalist!\r\n\r\nIt is true there was much reason in his holding to the opinion that the\r\nhyrax is no pachyderm.  Its habits are so unlike those of the\r\nthick-skinned brutes--its mode of life so different from that of a\r\nrhinoceros.\r\n\r\nIts habits are very simple, and can be told in a few words.  It is\r\ngregarious; dwells upon the mountains, and in the most rocky places;\r\nmakes its den in the crevices and caves that are found there, steals\r\nforth to eat or bask in the sun; runs timidly and with a shy suspicious\r\nlook; feeds on grass and leaves of plants, and is fond of those of\r\naromatic properties; can escape from most carnivorous quadrupeds, but is\r\nsuccessfully preyed upon by birds, and especially by the vulture-eagle--\r\nthe species already described.  Such is the history of the \"_daman_\" or\r\n\"_hyrax_,\" \"dassie,\" \"rock-badger,\" or \"rock-rabbit\"--by all of which\r\nnames the creature has figured in books.\r\n\r\nIt is one of those anomalies that cannot be classed with other\r\nquadrupeds, and has been constituted a genus of itself.  Two species are\r\nknown, differing very slightly from each other.  They are _Hyrax\r\nSyriacus_ and _Capensis_, or the Syrian and Cape hyrax.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting facts in relation to this quadruped is, that\r\nthe Syrian species is most probably the \"coney\" of the Scriptures.  In\r\nfact, the description can apply to no other existing animal.\r\n\r\nI have said that all this knowledge was obtained afterwards from the\r\nphilosopher, Hans.\r\n\r\nJust then there was no time for such observations; for the hyrax, with\r\ntwo or three of its companions, had scarce appeared from the platform,\r\nwhen the eagle shot down from the rock, and swooped right into the midst\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThe boys heard the shrill cry of the little quadrupeds, as the shadowy\r\nwings covered them; and expected to see the eagle rise with one of them\r\nin its talons.\r\n\r\nThey were disappointed, however, as well as the bird itself.  The\r\n\"rock-rabbits\" had been too quick for their well-known and dreaded\r\nenemy; and before the eagle was able to put a claw into their wool, they\r\nhad all scattered, and rushed within the safe shelter of their dark\r\ncaves.\r\n\r\nOf course, they were not coming out any more that afternoon.  The eagle\r\nseemed to have this very idea; for, rising into the air with a scream of\r\ndisappointment, it flew off towards the other side of the mountain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SIX.\r\n\r\nTHE KLIPSPRINGERS.\r\n\r\nIn hopes of getting a shot at it on the wing, the boys crouched behind\r\nthe boulders as it flew round, holding their guns in readiness.  It\r\npassed them at too great a distance, and none of them fired.\r\n\r\nThey expected to see it fly off, and wing its way towards the\r\nneighbouring mountains--as it could only be a stray visitor to the hill,\r\nsome hungry old eagle out upon a hunt.\r\n\r\nIt was about to do this; for it had already risen to a considerable\r\nelevation, and was heading away, when all at once it stopped suddenly in\r\nits flight, and balanced itself for some moments in the air, with neck\r\nbent downward, as if it had taken a fresh interest in some object that\r\nhad just come under its eye below.\r\n\r\nHad the rock-rabbits ventured forth again?  No.  It could not be they;\r\nfor the eagle was hovering over a different quarter--quite the opposite\r\nside of the mountain.  If rock-rabbits were in sight, they must be a\r\ndifferent party.  That was not improbable.  There might be others upon\r\nthe mountain.  And yet the eagle would not hover above _them_ in that\r\nway.  The habit of this species is not to \"swoop\" from on high, but to\r\nwatch from a perch upon some neighbouring rock, and dash upon the hyrax,\r\nwhen it comes out to feed or bask--precisely as the boys had seen it do.\r\n\r\nSo quick is the rock-rabbit in escaping to its retreat, that even an\r\neagle, darting from a high elevation, would fail to clutch it.  Had\r\nthere been rock-rabbits below, they would have perceived the great black\r\nbird above, and would have secured themselves at once.  It could not be\r\nthey that were now occupying the attention of the vulture-eagle.\r\n\r\nIt was _not_ they.  Hans, who with his double-barrel had hoped to obtain\r\na shot at the eagle, and had crept ahead of his companions to the other\r\nside of the tower-rock, saw that it was not rock-rabbits that had caused\r\nthe eagle to pause in its flight, but some creatures of a very different\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nAbout half-way down the slope grew a sandal-wood tree, one of the\r\nlargest upon the mountain, with a full bushy top.  Directly, under this\r\ntree was a mass of tabular rock, with a smooth top, quite horizontal,\r\nand several yards in length and breadth.  Over this, and nearly covering\r\nits whole extent, the sandal-wood threw its protecting shadow; so that\r\nwhile the hot sun baked down upon the surrounding slope, the surface of\r\nthe rock was kept shaded and cool.  It was just such a spot as one would\r\nhave chosen to have rested upon, commanding a far view of plains and\r\npicturesque mountains, and sweetly shaded from the burning noonday\r\nbeams--just such a spot as the contemplative mind would have desired,\r\nand in which, freed from care, it could have delivered itself up to\r\npleasant meditations.\r\n\r\nOne cannot help fancying that many of God's wild creatures, in selecting\r\ntheir haunts and homes, have an eye to the picturesque.  I can tell at a\r\nglance the cliff in which an eagle will make its eyrie, the glade that\r\nwill be haunted by the stag or the fallow-deer, the tree under which he\r\nwill repose, and oft times it has appeared to me that these favourite\r\nhaunts are chosen by animals less for the security they afford, than for\r\nthe picturesque beauty that surrounds them.\r\n\r\nOne could hardly have fancied that lone wild mountain--that smooth\r\ntable-rock--that fragrant sandal-wood tree--without some living thing\r\nplaced there by Nature to enjoy the scene, and give life to the\r\npicture--which would otherwise have been incomplete.\r\n\r\nIt was not incomplete.  It was crowned and perfect.  The shade of the\r\nsandal-wood fell not in vain.  Upon the surface of the table-rock was a\r\ngroup of living creatures born to enjoy that wild and lovely scene--\r\ncreated, as it were, to give a finish to the picture.\r\n\r\nThere were three individuals in this group--three quadrupeds of a kind\r\nthat had not been seen by the young yagers since the setting out of\r\ntheir expedition.  Though these animals wore a similar coat of hair, and\r\nwere of the same yellowish olive colour, all three were of different\r\nsizes.  The largest was scarce so tall as a pointer-dog, while the\r\nsmallest was still less than a tiny young kid.  The second was not\r\nhalf-way between the two, but nearly equal in size to the largest.  The\r\nprincipal difference between the latter two lay in the fact that the\r\nlarge one had a pair of horns upon its head, which the other wanted.\r\nThere were no horns neither upon their tiny little companion.  For all\r\nthis difference, the three were evidently of the same genus and species,\r\nnay, nearer relations still--of the same _family_.  They were a family\r\nof _klipspringers_.\r\n\r\nHans knew at once it was the klipspringer, (_Oreotragus saltatrix_), and\r\nso did all the others--for this interesting antelope is still found\r\nwithin the settled districts of the Cape Colony--wherever high\r\ninaccessible cliffs and rock-covered mountains afford it a secure\r\nretreat from dog, hunter, and hyena.\r\n\r\nAmong the many interesting forms of the antelope tribe, that present\r\nthemselves in South Africa, the klipspringer is not the least\r\ninteresting.  Though a very small creature, and of no great value to the\r\nhunter, it differs so much in its haunts and habits from others of the\r\nantelope race, as to make it an object of curiosity, even where it is\r\ncommon and often seen.  Unlike the oryx, the gnoo, the hartebeest, the\r\nblesbok, the eland, and a host of others, the klipspringer never appears\r\nupon the plain.  It is purely a mountain-dwelling animal, and the crag\r\nand cliff are its favourite haunts.  There it is safe from the\r\ncarnivorous beasts--the lion, the hyena, the wild-hounds, and the\r\njackal--none of which can reach its secure retreat upon the ledges of\r\nthe beetling precipice.  Even the leopard cannot follow it there--\r\nnotwithstanding his recurved claws that enable him to climb like a cat.\r\nOn the steep cliffs, and along the dizzy heights, the klipspringer has\r\nno equal in South Africa; he can scale them as no other quadruped; he\r\nfears no four-footed _beast_ of prey.  Three birds alone are his\r\ndangerous enemies--and these are the eagle of Verreaux, the Kaffir\r\neagle, and the lammergeyer.\r\n\r\nThe klipspringer stands about twenty inches in height is strongly and\r\ncompactly built, with stouter limbs than the small antelopes of the\r\nplain.  His horns are but four inches in length, rise vertically up from\r\nhis head, and incline slightly forward.  They are wrinkled at the base,\r\nand ringed in the middle.  The hair that covers his body is long, wiry,\r\nand thickly placed upon the skin; and standing out upon end, gives the\r\nanimal somewhat of a porcupine appearance.  The colour is a nearly\r\nuniform yellowish olive, caused by the individual hairs being\r\nash-coloured at the base, brown in the middle, and yellow at the tips.\r\nOne of the most characteristic points about the klipspringer is the\r\nformation of its hoofs.  These, instead of being long and pointed--as is\r\nthe case with most antelopes--are cylindrical in form, and rest\r\nvertically upon their bases.  They are jagged at the edges--so as to\r\ngive the animal the power of adhering to the smoothest rock, without\r\ndanger of slipping.  Like every piece of Nature's handiwork, they are\r\nperfectly adapted to the use for which they are intended.\r\n\r\nThe klipspringer is not gregarious; but is seen in pairs, or _families_,\r\nas they now appeared under the eyes of the young yagers.\r\n\r\nWhen Hans first noticed them, they were in different attitudes.  The\r\nbuck was standing upon the rock looking out over the plain below, but\r\nhad not as yet perceived the eagle--as the thick leafy top of the\r\nsandal-wood interposed between him and it.\r\n\r\nThe doe was lying down; while, kneeling beside her, and drawing\r\nnourishment from her teats, was the little kidling.\r\n\r\nPresently, the black shadow of the soaring bird passed over the\r\ngreensward of the plain.  It moved under the eyes of the buck, who,\r\nperceiving it, started suddenly, uttered a kind of hissing snort, and\r\nstruck the rock with his hoof.  This movement on his part brought the\r\ndoe at once to her feet, as well as the little fawn; and all three stood\r\nin an attitude of observation, turning their eyes now upon the shadow\r\nbelow, and now glancing suspiciously above.  After a moment they all\r\ncommenced leaping about, though they still kept upon the rock.  They saw\r\nthe eagle, for it had now moved out some distance over the plain, so\r\nthat the foliage of the tree was no longer interposed between it and\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was just at this moment that the eagle had paused in its flight, and\r\nhung poised in the air.  It had for the first time placed its eyes upon\r\nthe klipspringers.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the rapacious creature perceived the little fawn, cowering\r\nclose behind the body of its mother; and without more ado, the bird\r\ndirected its flight downward; and, when nearer, swooped straight at the\r\ngroup upon the rock.\r\n\r\nSudden as was the dash of the bird, it was a fruitless effort, and it\r\nrose again without having made a victim.\r\n\r\nBut when the spectators looked for the antelopes, not one of the three\r\nremained upon the table, where they had stood the moment before!  As\r\nquick as the flight of the bird, all three had sprung off from the rock,\r\nand thus escaped from its dreaded claws.\r\n\r\nOne would have supposed that the klipspringers would have hid themselves\r\nin crevices, as the conies had done.  Not so.  All three were seen--each\r\nstanding conspicuously upon the top of a rock, and seeming to await the\r\nfurther action of the bird.  With heads erect, and eyes turned upward,\r\nthey stood, evidently expecting a renewal of the attack.  The eagle,\r\nafter hovering around and calculating its distance, swooped again.\r\n\r\nIn this fresh attempt of the tyrant the little fawn alone was aimed at.\r\nHad it been the others, they would have sprung out of reach as before;\r\nand so, too, did the fawn repeatedly, bounding from rock to rock, with\r\nthe elasticity of an india-rubber ball.  But the wily bird continued the\r\nattack, turning each time in shorter circles, until the tiny limbs of\r\nthe youthful antelope trembled with weariness.  During all this time the\r\nold ones leaped about, bounding high in the air, and descending upon the\r\nsharpest edges of the rocks, as if they had alighted from a flight with\r\nwings.  The object of their movements evidently was to draw the attack\r\nof the eagle upon themselves, and thus save their offspring.\r\n\r\nIt was to no purpose, however.  The cunning ravisher preferred making a\r\nvictim of the kid, and paid no attention to the manoeuvres of the old\r\nones.  No doubt, there were eaglets on the neighbouring mountain, and\r\nthe tenderest venison was wanted for their dinner.\r\n\r\nAt all events, the eagle continued to assail the poor little fawn, until\r\nthe latter had no longer strength left to leap from the rock upon which\r\nit had taken its last stand.\r\n\r\nAnother dash made the eagle--a last and final swoop.  Its talons closed\r\nlike a cramp upon the vertebrae of the tiny quadruped, which the next\r\nmoment was borne aloft into the air!\r\n\r\nA shrill sad bleating was heard from below--drowned for an instant by\r\nthe discharge of several guns, whose reports echoed like thunder from\r\nthe rocks; and then the winged robber, with his victim still clutched in\r\nhis talons, was seen falling with fluttering wings to the earth!\r\n\r\nThe Young Yagers--by Captain Mayne Reid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nHUNTING THE KLIPSPRINGER.\r\n\r\nThe eagle dropped not far from the summit; and the boys, running down to\r\nthe spot, found it lying quite dead, with the little klipspringer--also\r\ndead of course--still fast in its claws.  The talons sunk deeply into\r\nthe flesh, embraced the spine, and even in death the fierce bird had not\r\nrelaxed its hold!\r\n\r\nSome would have considered the death of the eagle a just punishment;\r\nbut, then, what was its crime?  It is true, it had killed, and would\r\nhave carried away, the little fawn of an innocent antelope--one of the\r\nmost harmless of creatures.  But what else could it have done?  Nature\r\nhad taught it to sustain itself in this way.  Perhaps it had a nest on\r\nthe brow of some beetling precipice--for this vulture-eagle of South\r\nAfrica is a dweller upon rocks, and not a _tree-eagle_--perhaps in this\r\nnest it had a pair of downy little eaglets, each with an appetite like\r\nthat of an ostrich--perhaps they were expecting that very kid, or some\r\nsimilar dish, for dinner; and would have been very hungry without it--\r\nmight have died of hunger?  What, then, could the parent bird do but\r\nprovide them, though at the expense of other parents just as much\r\nattached to their offspring as an eagle could be?  How can it be\r\nregarded as a crime?  The eagle did not wantonly destroy the antelope,\r\nbut to satisfy the cravings of hunger.  It only obeyed one of the laws\r\nof Nature.\r\n\r\nCruel laws they _do_ seem; yet, if they be crimes, Nature herself is\r\nanswerable.  Alas! we cannot comprehend, and, I fear, in this life never\r\nwill comprehend, why we, the creatures of the earth, are born to prey\r\nupon one another.  A puzzle to the humane heart is that \"chain of\r\ndestruction.\"\r\n\r\nWanton killing of animals _is_ a crime; and our hunters, at first sight,\r\nmight be thought chargeable with this in having _wantonly_ shot down the\r\neagle.  Such was not the case, however.  They did not do so out of any\r\nfeeling of wantonness.  They had a proper object in shooting the bird.\r\nIt was the representative of a rare and little-known species, and the\r\npossession of its skin for _scientific purposes_ had something to do\r\nwith the fatal aim that brought it down--for it was from the\r\ndouble-barrel of the naturalist the shot was sent that destroyed it.\r\n\r\nBy the act the klipspringers had been avenged, though there was little\r\nidea of giving them vengeance in the minds of the young hunters.  Quite\r\nthe contrary; for in five minutes after, the whole six--buck-dogs and\r\nall--were in full chase after these creatures, as ready to rob them of\r\ntheir lives as they had been to take away that of their winged enemy.\r\n\r\nNor was it out of wantonness either, or the mere love of hunting, though\r\nthat might have been the principal motive with one or two of the party.\r\nBut there was a curiosity about these little antelopes, and a desire to\r\nexamine them more closely, that urged the young yagers to attempt their\r\ndestruction.  They desired to possess their trophies.\r\n\r\nYou may wonder why they should care about the horns of a klipspringer,\r\nsince it is not one of the rare antelopes within the boundaries of the\r\nsettlements!  True, the animal itself is not rare; but it is a rare\r\noccurrence, when one falls before the bullet of the hunter--as the\r\nklipspringer is as shy and wary as the chamois itself--and, dwelling in\r\nthe most inaccessible places, it is difficult game to capture.  Hence,\r\nthe killing of a klipspringer is regarded in the light of a feat, and\r\nits little horns are by no means an ordinary trophy.\r\n\r\nThe young yagers, therefore, wanted the pair belonging to the buck that\r\nwas now leaping over the rocks below.\r\n\r\nSome minutes were spent in deliberating as to what would be the best\r\nmode of getting possession of them.\r\n\r\nAt the report of the guns both the klipspringers had gone farther down\r\nthe mountains, and were now standing upon a large boulder near its base.\r\n\r\nHendrik proposed that the party should dash right down after them--dogs\r\nand all--and force them out into the plain, where, it was well known,\r\nthey could make but a poor run, and would be easily overtaken by the\r\nbuck-dogs.\r\n\r\nThis plan seemed feasible.  The antelopes were very near the base of the\r\nmountain.  The hunters coming on them from above could easily drive them\r\ninto the plain; and then there would be a run between them and the dogs,\r\nof which a fine view would be obtained.\r\n\r\nOff started the whole party, directing their course straight down the\r\nmountain to the point where the klipspringers were seen.  The dogs were\r\nset free, and sprang forward in advance.\r\n\r\nThe hunters moved on as fast as the nature of the ground would permit\r\nthem; and in ten minutes would have been near enough to the\r\nklipspringers to have fired, had the latter favoured them by remaining\r\nin their place.  But they did not do so.  Of course, they had a full\r\nview of their enemies as they advanced; and before the hunters had got\r\nhalf-way down, the nimble game set off round the bottom of the hill,\r\nflitting from rock to rock like a brace of birds.\r\n\r\nWhat seemed odd in their mode of progressing was, that instead of\r\nrunning along the open spaces between the fragments of rock, they chose\r\nthe rocks themselves for their path, and of these also the most\r\nprominent ones; so that their flight was a succession of bounds, some of\r\nthem of enormous length!  Many of the boulders, on which they rested a\r\nmoment, and from which they sprang again, were so narrow at the top,\r\nthat the little creatures hardly obtained room for their feet; and, with\r\ntheir four hoofs touching each other, they would spring off as though\r\nmoved, not by muscular power, but under the influence of some elastic\r\nforce!\r\n\r\nAt first the hunters believed their task to be an easy one.  The\r\nmountain surface was of so limited an extent, they would soon surround\r\nthe game, or force it out upon the plain.  The first attempt to do so,\r\nhowever, had ended in a failure.  The klipspringers had escaped without\r\ndifficulty to the other side, and were now farther off than ever!\r\n\r\nThe hunters called up the dogs, recrossed the summit, and once more set\r\ntheir eyes upon the game, perched as before upon prominent points.\r\n\r\nA second time the party advanced, spreading as they went down, and\r\nholding their guns in readiness; but long before they were within range,\r\nthe klipspringers took to flight again; and, just as they had done\r\nbefore, passed around the base to the other side of the mountain.  Of\r\ncourse, the dogs, scrambling clumsily among the rocks, were, no match\r\nfor such game as they; and even had the klipspringers been near enough\r\nfor the guns, the most accomplished riflemen could not have \"sighted\"\r\nthem, so quick were their motions.  The only chance of the yagers lay in\r\ntheir shot-guns, and to have hit them, even with these, would have been\r\na feat equal to the bringing down a snipe or woodcock.\r\n\r\nOnce more the boys attempted to drive them into the open plain; but with\r\nthe same result as before.  Although the hunters had spread themselves\r\nacross the mountain, the nimble game dashed past them, and escaped to\r\nthe other side.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem now proposed a new plan.  That was for all to descend the\r\nmountain to its base, and there make a complete surround of it.  Then\r\neach to march straight up, and, by hemming the game on all sides, _force\r\nthem to the summit_.\r\n\r\n\"In this way,\" added Groot Willem, \"we'll at least have a crack at them;\r\nfor if they try to get back through our line, they must pass near some\r\nof us.\"\r\n\r\nGroot Willem's suggestion was adopted.  The yagers now descended to the\r\nbase of the mountain; and, separating, spread around it at equal\r\ndistances from one another.  The buck-dogs were also distributed; one\r\ngoing with each hunter, except Klaas, who had no dog to accompany him.\r\nSince the affair with the blauw-bok, there had been only five in the\r\npack.\r\n\r\nThus placed, the boys recommenced the ascent.  They proceeded with\r\nproper caution, keeping each other in view, and shouting from time to\r\ntime words of instruction as to the position of the game.  These were\r\nseen bounding before them, from rock to rock--now crossing the mountain\r\nto the opposite side, with the intention of escaping in that way--now\r\nzigzagging along the sides, or bounding upward toward the summit.\r\n\r\nWhen the hunters had advanced about half-way up, the klipspringers\r\nbecame frightened in earnest.  They saw that they were encompassed on\r\nevery side; and sprang to and fro like a pair of grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nAt length they seemed determined to run the gauntlet through the circle\r\nof hunters, and made a bold dash in the direction of Hans.  The\r\nnaturalist, although not professing to be much of a hunter, was a\r\ncapital shot; and, raising his double-barrel, he fired.\r\n\r\nThe doe fell to the crack; and the buck, suddenly turning as on a pivot,\r\nonce more bounded up the slope.  The dogs had already gained a distance\r\nahead of their masters, and now advanced upon the buck from all sides.\r\nThere seemed no chance left him of avoiding their onset.\r\n\r\nHe had mounted a boulder near the base of the tower-rock; and the five\r\nwere rushing upon him with open jaws, and shining teeth, when, all at\r\nonce, as if impelled by a spring, he shot upward to a narrow ledge of\r\nthe vertical rock, far beyond their reach.  The ledge was scarcely wide\r\nenough to have given footing to a weasel, and yet the klipspringer\r\nseemed to feel quite secure upon it.  But he did not rest there.  The\r\nshouts of the hunters, as they hurried up the mountain, impelled him\r\nfarther; and springing to a still higher ledge, and to another still\r\nhigher, he stood at length upon the pinnacle of the rock!\r\n\r\nA shout of surprise broke from the hunters as they witnessed this\r\nwonderful feat.  And a singular spectacle it was.  As already stated,\r\nthe tower-rock ended in a point scarce four inches in diameter; and upon\r\nthis stood the klipspringer, his hoofs pressed closely together, his\r\nneck drawn in, his body gathered into a ball, with the stiff wiry hair\r\nradiating on all sides outward, like the spines of a hedgehog--a curious\r\nobject to look upon!\r\n\r\nAlthough the hunters were now within shot, so odd did the creature\r\nappear thus placed that not one of them thought of drawing trigger upon\r\nit.  They knew that they had the buck in their power--the dogs were all\r\naround him--and at such a height, full thirty feet from the ground, it\r\ncould not escape.  All therefore held their fire, and ran forward to the\r\nbottom of the tower.\r\n\r\nThey had made a sad mistake about the powers of that klipspringer.  As\r\nthey were congratulating themselves on having trapped the buck in so odd\r\na manner, he was seen to shoot out into the air, and, with a whizzing\r\nnoise like that made by some great bird, he passed close to their ears,\r\nand lit upon the boulder from which he had bounded up!  Scarce an\r\ninstant did he rest there, but sprang to another, and another, and in a\r\nfew seconds was far down the side of the mountain!\r\n\r\nSo sudden had been this movement on the part of the game, and so\r\nunexpected, that both dogs and hunters were taken by surprise, and not a\r\nshot was fired until the klipspringer was beyond reach!  Just at that\r\nmoment, as they stood watching his retreat, a puff of smoke was noticed\r\nfar down the mountain--a gun cracked at the same instant--and the buck\r\nwas seen to tumble headlong from a rock!\r\n\r\nWith fresh surprise the hunters turned to one another.  \"Who?\" exclaimed\r\nall simultaneously.  Ha! there were only five of them.  One was missing!\r\n\r\n\"It's Klaas!\"\r\n\r\nIt was Klaas beyond a doubt--Klaas who had killed the klipspringer.\r\n\r\nKlaas had given an illustration that the \"race is not always to the\r\nswift.\"  He was rather a heavy boy, was Klaas; and feeling fatigued at\r\nso much climbing, had seated himself on a stone, and was taking a bit of\r\na rest, when he observed the klipspringer, standing upon a rock right\r\nbefore his face.  Having his light fowling-piece loaded with buckshot,\r\nhe had taken aim, and dropped the buck from his perch.\r\n\r\nJan was not a little jealous, and insinuated that it was a bit of \"luck\"\r\nnot very well deserved; but whether it was luck or not, Klaas had\r\ncertainly killed the klipspringer, and was not a little elated at his\r\nperformance.\r\n\r\nHaving collected the game, the young yagers proceeded to where they had\r\nleft their horses; and, mounting, galloped off after the wagons that\r\nwere moving slowly across the distant plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nBOLD BIRDS.\r\n\r\nOn the third day after entering the plains of the \"zuur-veldt,\" the\r\nyagers treked to the banks of a large river, and followed its course\r\nup-stream.  The scenery was altogether new and of a different character\r\nto that of the plains.  The river was fringed with reeds and willows,\r\nand beyond these stretched a wide bottom land of meadow-like character,\r\nstudded with groves and copses of green trees whose foliage was grateful\r\nto the eye after the journey over the dry plains.  Here the deceitful\r\nmirage no longer tantalised them with prospects of verdant groves and\r\nsmooth limpid lakes.  Both existed in reality; and a succession of\r\nlovely landscapes met the eyes of the travellers as they advanced.\r\n\r\nThe grass upon the banks of this river was excellent, and in order that\r\ntheir cattle should have the opportunity of a good feed, the party\r\nformed camp at an early hour.  They outspanned in a little meadow,\r\ndirectly by the edge of the water, and made a fire out of the stems of\r\nthe willows that grew near.\r\n\r\nJan and Klaas noticed a large flock of birds hovering above the water,\r\nand swooping about, something in the same manner as swallows on a summer\r\nevening over the surface of an English lake.\r\n\r\nThey were birds of a moderate size, scarcely so big as a common pigeon--\r\nnor was there any thing in their colour to make them attractive.  They\r\nwere rather a dull-coloured set of birds for Africa, being\r\nreddish-brown, with a mixture of white and grey; but had they been near\r\nenough for the boys to have observed their feet and legs, these with the\r\n\"cire\" around their eyes, would have appeared of a beautiful\r\norange-yellow colour.\r\n\r\nThere was one peculiarity about these birds, which could be observed at\r\na great distance, and that was their \"forked\" tails.  In this respect\r\nthey might also be said to resemble swallows, but the forking was far\r\nless acute than in the tails of the latter.  There was enough of it to\r\ngive the birds a character; and that, with their general form and the\r\ncolour of their plumage, made it easy enough to tell to what genus the\r\nbirds belonged.  They were birds of the genus _Falco_, (hawks,)\r\nbelonging to that section of it distinguished as _Milvus_, (the kites.)\r\n\r\nOf the kites there are several species, but the particular one to which\r\nthese before the eyes of Klaas and Jan belonged, was the \"parasite\r\nkite,\" (_Milvus ater_), an inhabitant of all parts of the continent of\r\nAfrica, and a bird somewhat smaller than the royal kite of Europe.\r\n\r\nBoth these bird-boys knew that the birds were hawks of some kind, but\r\nthey could not tell what sort.  When Hans told them that they were\r\n\"kites,\" they both became doubly interested; and, guns in hand, stood\r\nnear the water's edge watching the manoeuvres of the long-winged\r\nfork-tailed creatures.\r\n\r\nTo a superficial observer it might have appeared that these kites were\r\nmerely playing themselves; now poised and hovering in the air, now\r\nfloating softly along, and at intervals shooting down until they\r\n\"dipped\" themselves in the water of the stream.  Any one, however, who\r\nhad closely watched them for a time would soon have perceived, that they\r\nwere not going through these manoeuvres for simple amusement.  Each time\r\nthat one of them made a plunge into the water, it might be observed that\r\nin rising again, it carried a shining object in its talons, which object\r\nwas neither more nor less than a tiny little fish.  Fishing, then, was\r\nwhat the \"parasites\" were after; and not for amusement, as anglers do,\r\nbut following it as a regular calling--in fact, following it for food.\r\n\r\nNot that fish forms the only food of this species of lute.  No; it will\r\neat almost any thing,--little quadrupeds, birds, reptiles, and even\r\ncarrion, upon a pinch.  It is, however, very fond of fish; and, when it\r\nchances to reside in a country of waters, where fish are plenteous and\r\neasily procured, it follows the calling of a fisher pretty regularly.\r\n\r\nKlaas and Jan stood for some time expecting to get a shot; but as none\r\nof the birds came near enough, they at length gave up all hope, and laid\r\naside their guns.\r\n\r\nShortly after, dinner was ready, and all the boys sat down upon the\r\nwagon-chests, and commenced eating.  Their dinner that day consisted of\r\na very nice dish--that is, the flesh of the great South African bustard\r\n(_Otis tarda_) or wild peacock, (wilde pauw,) as they themselves termed\r\nthe bird.  Groot Willem had that morning shot this fine game, at very\r\nlong range, with his \"roer;\" and but for the far \"carry\" of his gun they\r\nwould not have procured the bird--for the wild peacock is one of the\r\nshyest kinds of game-birds, and scarcely ever rests within shooting\r\ndistance of any cover by which it may be approached.  Large as it is, it\r\nis esteemed the most delicate eating of South African birds, and almost\r\nequal to the wild turkey of America.\r\n\r\nNow the young yagers had roasted this precious _morceau_, had carved it,\r\nand each was sitting with a piece in hand--one with a wing, another\r\nhaving the \"drumstick,\" a third the \"merrythought,\" a fourth the \"pope's\r\nnose,\" and so on.  Of course they were in a high state of enjoyment over\r\nsuch \"titbits.\"\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in this pleasant way, they were astonished to see the\r\nwhole flock of kites come suddenly swooping over the camp.  Klaas and\r\nJan were the more astonished, since they had been for some half-hour\r\nvainly endeavouring to get within shot of these very birds.  _Now_ there\r\nwould have been no difficulty about that, for the parasites not only\r\ncame within shooting distance, but, actually and literally, flew _in the\r\nvery faces_ of the boys!  Yes; they would swoop right up until within a\r\nfew feet of the diners, then poise themselves upon their wings, spread\r\nout their tails, turn over on their backs, and execute sundry other\r\neccentric manoeuvres that put the six yagers into fits of laughter.  Of\r\ncourse Swartboy joined in the chorus, and even the grave Kaffir grinned\r\nat the ludicrous spectacle.\r\n\r\nBut it did not end here.  After a while the birds grew bolder and\r\nbolder; at each swoop they came nearer; until at length several of them\r\nactually snatched pieces of the bustard's flesh out of the very hands of\r\nthose that were eating it!  Verily did they illustrate the old adage of\r\n\"many a slip between cup and lip.\"\r\n\r\nEven the dogs were made victims of these bold little robbers, who\r\nswooped forward to their very muzzles, and snatched at the bones they\r\nwere crunching.\r\n\r\nThis curious scene continued for some time.  It would have ended sooner,\r\nhad the business been in the hands of Klaas and Jan.  Both these boys,\r\nat the first approach of the birds, had started up to get their guns,\r\nbut they were withheld from using them by the others, and especially by\r\nHans--who was desirous of observing these curious little hawks with the\r\neye of a naturalist.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the bird-boys were allowed to \"blaze away;\" and, what is\r\nstill more singular, their repeated shots did not completely frighten\r\noff the parasites, though several were killed!  Even some that must have\r\nbeen wounded--since the feathers had been knocked out of them--returned\r\nagain and again to hover above the camp, with eyes fixed eagerly upon\r\nthe scraps of meat that had been left lying upon the chests!\r\n\r\nA little incident was yet to occur of a still more ludicrous character.\r\n\r\nHans had that day shot a pigeon of very beautiful plumage, which is\r\npeculiar to the interior of South Africa, and whose wings and body are\r\nof a deep green colour.  This species is somewhat rare, and Hans was\r\ndesirous of preserving the skin and having it mounted.  After dinner,\r\ntherefore, he had skinned it; and having thrown its flesh to the dogs,\r\nhe was still at work upon the skin, taking out the brains.\r\n\r\nKlaas and Jan, satiated with sport, had desisted, and laid aside their\r\nguns--the consequence of which was that the parasites had returned in\r\ngreat numbers, and now exhibited as much effrontery as ever.\r\n\r\nAll at once, one of them seeing Hans engaged with the pigeon, and\r\nthinking no doubt that the body of the bird was still in its skin, made\r\na sudden dash, drove its claw through the feathery mass, and carried off\r\nthe skin in triumph!  Hans, whose eyes had been closely bent upon his\r\nwork, saw nothing of the approach of the little winged robber; and for\r\nsome moments believed that one of the boys, out of a \"lark,\" had\r\nsnatched the pigeon from his fingers.  It was not until he looked\r\naround, and then up into the air, that he was aware of the real culprit;\r\nand although all rushed to their guns, the pigeon-skin could not be\r\nrecovered--as the kite, on seizing it, rose high into the air, and then\r\ncarried it off to the other side of the river!\r\n\r\nAs not a bit of flesh remained in the skin, and as Hans had succeeded in\r\nextracting even the brains, no doubt the parasite soon discovered that\r\nhis _pigeon_ was no better than a \"decoy!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER THIRTY NINE.\r\n\r\nTHE WATERBUCK.\r\n\r\nThe bank upon which the yagers had encamped was about five or six feet\r\nabove the surface of the water, as it now stood.  The bank on the\r\nopposite side also rose above the water level; but on both sides there\r\nwas a break or declivity that sloped down into the channel.  These\r\nbreaks corresponded with each other.  They were not natural gorges, but\r\nhad evidently been made by heavy animals, such as rhinoceroses and\r\nothers, that were in the habit of coming either to drink or ford the\r\nriver at this point.  The tracks of many kinds of animals could be\r\ndistinguished leading down to the water or up into the meadow--so that\r\nthe place was evidently a \"drift,\" or crossing-place for the wild beasts\r\nof the country around.\r\n\r\nPerhaps at night many would cross here, and Hendrik and Groot Willem had\r\nresolved to watch that night and have a little moonlight sport.  A\r\nmoon--and a very fine moon--was expected; for the queen of the heavens\r\nwas nearly in the full at the time, and the sky all that day had been\r\nwithout a cloud.\r\n\r\nBut they were destined to enjoy a little sport before the moon arose--\r\neven before the sun had gone down.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged around the wagons, their attention was attracted by a\r\nmovement among the reeds on the opposite side of the river.  There was\r\nalso an open space on that side corresponding to the meadow in which\r\nthey were encamped.  Around the opening grew a thick brake of tall\r\nreeds, interspersed with willows and other low trees.  It was among\r\nthese reeds that the movement was observed.\r\n\r\nPresently a large animal came out of the covert, and stepped boldly\r\nforward into the open ground, where the short sward enabled them to see\r\nit from horn to hoof--for it was a creature with hoofs and horns--\r\nwithout doubt an antelope.\r\n\r\nIt was a species, however, which none of the party had ever seen\r\nbefore--an antelope of majestic form and elegant proportions.\r\n\r\nIt stood nearly five feet in height by full nine in length, and its\r\ngeneral colour was a greyish sepia brown.  Its face, however, was of a\r\ndeeper brown around the bases of the horns and over the frontlet tinged\r\nwith rufous.  The lips and muzzle were white; a white patch marked the\r\nthroat; a white streak was before each of the eyes; and a curious oval\r\nband of white encircled the tail.  The hair over all the body was harsh,\r\nmore resembling split whalebone than hair; but that which covered the\r\nneck was longer than the rest, and stood out all around like a mane on\r\nend.  The horns were nearly three feet in length, and curved first\r\nupwards and then slightly inwards.  They were closely ringed to within\r\nsix inches of their tips, and of a whitish green colour.  The tail of\r\nthe animal was about eighteen inches in length with a tuft at its tip.\r\n\r\nThe shape and set of the horns, the rigid hair that grew all around the\r\nthroat and neck, and the elegant upright bearing of this antelope,\r\nenabled the naturalist Hans to tell his companions to what species it\r\nbelonged.  It was the famed \"waterbuck,\" (_Aigocerus ellipsiprymnus_).\r\n\r\nI have said \"famed\" antelope, because the waterbuck is in reality one of\r\nthe finest and most famous animals of the whole tribe.\r\n\r\nIts name would seem to imply that it was a dweller in the water.  Such,\r\nhowever, is not the case.  It is called waterbuck because it is never\r\nfound far from the banks of a river or other water, in which it delights\r\nto plunge, and bathe itself during the hot sunshiny hours of the day.\r\nOf course it is an excellent swimmer, and, indeed, such confidence has\r\nit in its powers of swimming, that when hunted or pursued by whatever\r\nenemy, it makes directly for the river and plunges in, no matter what\r\ndepth may be the water.  It is the habit of many species of deer to make\r\nfor water when hunted, but with them the object is to throw the hounds\r\noff the scent, and having once crossed a river, they continue on through\r\nthe woods.  Now the waterbuck does not leave the river for any great\r\ndistance.  It either swims downstream, or, having gone out on the\r\nopposite bank, returns to it, after making a short detour through the\r\nwoods.  It seems to regard the water as its haven of safety, and when\r\novertaken usually stands at bay in the very middle of the stream.\r\n\r\nIt loves to dwell along rivers where there are marshy banks covered with\r\ntall sedge and reeds; and at certain seasons of the year, when these are\r\npartially inundated, the waterbuck is rarely seen--as it then makes its\r\nhaunt in the very heart of morasses which are impenetrable to the\r\nhunter.  Its long spreading hoofs enable it to pass with safety over\r\nmarshy grounds, where other species of antelopes would be \"mired\" and\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nThe waterbuck has been classed by naturalists with antelopes of the\r\n_aigocerine_, or goat-horned group; but it differs greatly, both in\r\nhorns and habits, from any of these, and deserves to be ranked as an\r\nantelope _sui generis_.  If it were established as a separate genus, it\r\nwould not stand alone, since another \"waterbuck\"--evidently a second\r\nspecies--has been discovered by late explorers a little farther to the\r\nnorth, upon the shores of the Lake Ngami.  The latter is termed by the\r\nnatives the \"leche,\" and in the shape of its horns, and most of its\r\nhabits, it bears a decided generic resemblance to the _Aigocerus\r\nellipsiprymnus_.\r\n\r\nStill a third species of waterbuck has turned up during the recent\r\nexplorations to the afore-mentioned lake; but this, though in habit very\r\nsimilar to the others, differs widely in regard to its physical\r\ncharacteristics.  Its horns are of the spiral form, greatly resembling\r\nthose of the koodoo, (_Strepsiceros koodoo_), and naturalists are\r\ndisposed to class it in the genus _Tragelaphus_.  Its name among the\r\nnatives is \"nakong.\"\r\n\r\nThe reason why none of our young hunters were _personally_ acquainted\r\nwith the waterbuck was, that none of them had ever seen it before; and\r\nthe reason why none of them had seen it was, because it is not found in\r\nany part of the country through which they had hitherto travelled.  It\r\nis altogether a tropical or sub-tropical species, loves a warm climate,\r\nand does not range so far south as the Cape settlements.  It is possible\r\nthat there may be other species by the rivers that run through the\r\nunknown interior of Africa; for between that southern territory, which\r\nhas been yet explored, and the Great Saara, there lie many strange\r\ncountries, and many strange creatures, of which the geographer and the\r\nnaturalist yet know nothing.\r\n\r\nSo, my boy reader, if you should be desirous at any period of your life\r\nto achieve the reputation of a Bruce, a Park, a Denham, a Clapperton, or\r\na Lander, you need not fear the want of an opportunity.  There is still\r\nenough of \"unexplored Africa\" to employ adventurous spirits for perhaps\r\na century to come.  At all events the ardent naturalist will find plenty\r\nof new ground up to the new year's day of 2000!  That I can safely\r\nguarantee.\r\n\r\nThe Young Yagers--by Captain Mayne Reid\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY.\r\n\r\nTHE RAVENOUS REPTILE.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were fixed upon the beautiful animal as it approached the\r\nriver.  With light majestic step it advanced to the bank, and without\r\npausing walked down the slope.  It had no fear of the water, and stepped\r\ninto it without hesitation.\r\n\r\nThe boys were in hopes that it intended to cross the river.  On the\r\nopposite bank it was too distant for the a carry of their guns--even the\r\nelephant roer could not have sent a bullet to that side with any chance\r\nof hitting.  Should the antelope cross, however, the case would be\r\ndifferent.  It might then come within range of their pieces; and, to\r\nmake sure, Hendrik and Groot Willem had stolen under the cover of the\r\nreeds, and advanced nearer the crossing-place.\r\n\r\nThey were doomed to disappointment, however.  The waterbuck had no\r\nintention of crossing.  It had come to drink; and having waded in\r\nknee-deep, it stopped, and dipped its muzzle into the water for that\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nWith disappointed looks the boys remained gazing upon it as it drank.\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that close to the spot where the buck had entered the\r\nwater there was a black log.  It lay along the water in a direction\r\nparallel to the bank, and seemed to be floating--though only a small\r\nportion of it appeared above the surface.  Saturated with the water, as\r\nit must have been, its weight perhaps had thus partially immersed it.\r\nThe boys had given no heed to this log.  It was the half-decayed trunk\r\nof some tree--perhaps the black-barked acacia--that had been carried\r\ndownstream during flood-time, and had made a lodgment in the little bay,\r\nwhere the path entered the water.  Of course to such an ordinary\r\ncircumstance the boys gave no heed.  Neither did the waterbuck.  Ah!\r\nfalse security!  Better for the antelope had it heeded that log!  Better\r\nfor it had it \"looked before leaping,\" and carefully scrutinised that\r\nblack-barked thing--for black though it was, it was not the log of any\r\nacacia.  _That log was alive_!\r\n\r\nTo the astonishment of all the boys, and no doubt to the far greater\r\nastonishment of the waterbuck, the dark object suddenly became endowed\r\nwith motive power, and was seen to dart forward with the velocity of an\r\narrow towards the spot where the animal was drinking.  It was no longer\r\na log, but a hideous reptile--a crocodile of gigantic dimensions!\r\n\r\nThe boys expected to see the waterbuck rear back, and attempt to escape.\r\nNo doubt so it would have done, had the crocodile missed its aim, but\r\nthe latter had not missed.  On the contrary, it had seized the muzzle of\r\nthe antelope in its long gaunt jaws, and was proceeding to drag its\r\nvictim under the water.\r\n\r\nThere was a struggle not of long duration, but it was terrible while it\r\nlasted.  The buck pranced, and plunged and spread his legs, and\r\nendeavoured to shake off his reptile assailant.  Several times he was\r\nbrought to his knees; but being a powerful animal he recovered his legs\r\nagain, and once nearly succeeded in drawing the crocodile out upon the\r\nbank.  All the while, too, he kept striking forward with his sharp\r\nfore-hoofs; but desperate as were the hits he made, they produced no\r\nimpression upon the harsh scaly coat of his amphibious antagonist.  Had\r\nthe latter held him by any other part, he might have had some chance of\r\nescape; but seized as he had been by the very tip of his snout, his head\r\nwas all the time kept close down to the water, and the awkward position\r\nrendered it impossible for him to make use of his horns--his principal\r\nweapons of defence.\r\n\r\nThe crocodile was by no means one of the largest of his kind--else the\r\nstruggle would have ended sooner.  A very large one--that is, one of\r\nsixteen to twenty feet in length--can drag a buffalo bull under water,\r\nand a buffalo bull possesses four times the strength of a waterbuck.\r\nThe one now seen was not over ten feet long; and the strong waterbuck\r\nmight have been a full match for it, had it not been for the unfair hold\r\nwhich it had taken.  In that, however, lay the advantage of the reptile,\r\nand it seemed to be aware of it, for from the first moment it never\r\nrelaxed the \"clutch\" it had taken, but held on with its terrible teeth\r\nand strong jaws, closed like a clamp on the snout of its victim!\r\n\r\nNow the crocodile was raised some feet out of the river, and the boys\r\ncould see its ugly breast, and spread hand-like claws; now using its\r\npowerful tail as a fulcrum it would strike against the water, and then\r\nthe head of the buck would be plunged below the surface, and held down\r\nfor minutes at a time.  Of course during all this while the water was\r\nkept in commotion; and, what with the struggles of the quadruped and the\r\nlashing of the reptile's tail, a constant spray of froth and bubbles\r\nmarked the scene of the strife.\r\n\r\nThe conflict at length came to an end.  The water-tyrant triumphed.  The\r\nbuck was dragged into the river beyond his depth; and although few\r\nquadrupeds could swim as well as he, once off his legs he was no longer\r\na match for the amphibious saurian.  His head and horns both disappeared\r\nbeneath the surface--now and then the tail of the crocodile flapped\r\nupward, as it exerted itself to keep its victim under--and then both\r\nreptile and quadruped sank to the bottom of the river, and were seen no\r\nmore!\r\n\r\nFor some time the hunters remained watching the surface of the water.\r\nThey saw the frothy bubbles floating over the spot--some of them reddish\r\nwith the blood of the waterbuck--but the current soon carried them away,\r\nand the river glided past smooth and silent as if no such commotion had\r\noccurred in its waters.\r\n\r\nThe hunters all returned to the wagons, and a conversation now occurred\r\nabout crocodiles, in which Congo took part.\r\n\r\nThe Kaffir had hunted upon the great river Limpopo, which lay to the\r\nnortheast of their present camp.  He alleged that there crocodiles were\r\nvery numerous, and some were seen of enormous dimensions, attaining to\r\nthirty feet in length, with bodies as thick as a rhinoceros; that such\r\nscenes, as that they had just witnessed, were of no uncommon occurrence\r\nthere.  He said that the larger crocodiles frequently attacked\r\nbuffaloes, precisely as this one had done the waterbuck--that they lie\r\nin wait by the watering-places of these animals, and seizing them by the\r\nmuzzle when they are drinking, drag them under water, and thus suffocate\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nBut Congo related a still more curious habit of the crocodiles.  He\r\nasserted that they never devour their prey until it becomes quite\r\ndecomposed--that is, until it attains the condition of carrion.  He\r\nstated that when a crocodile has killed a buffalo or any large animal,\r\nit always drags the carcass back to the shore, and, leaving it exposed\r\nto the action of the sun's rays, watches near it until the flesh has\r\nbecome _tainted to its taste_!  The young yagers had heard of this\r\nbefore; but were not inclined to believe it, though Congo now assured\r\nthem of its truth--alleging that this habit of the crocodile was well\r\nknown among the native hunters of the Limpopo.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the sneers of many naturalists, the simple savage was\r\nright, as the young yagers themselves were soon enabled to prove.\r\n\r\nI have said that when the crocodile and his victim disappeared below the\r\nsurface, they were seen no more.  That, however, was not strictly true.\r\nBoth of them were seen again, and in a very short while after--more than\r\nseen, indeed; for the crocodile was killed by a bullet from Groot\r\nWillem's roer; and upon venison steaks, cut from the buttocks of the\r\nwaterbuck, both Congo and Swartboy--as well as the buck-dogs--made them\r\na hearty supper.\r\n\r\nIt was thus the thing came about.  Hans had entered into a dissertation\r\nabout crocodiles in general.  He was informing his companions of the\r\nnumber of new species of these creatures that had been lately\r\ndiscovered, and pointing out the great progress of natural science\r\nduring the present half century; how the crocodiles were divided by\r\nmodern naturalists into many genera, and that, including the caimans and\r\nalligators of America, and the gavials of Asia, the whole crocodile\r\nfamily could not number less than two dozen living species, although but\r\na few years ago it was supposed there were but three kinds in existence;\r\nhow America possessed true crocodiles as well as alligators; how the\r\nnumber of species in America was greater than that of Africa and Asia\r\ntaken together; how there were none of these great reptiles found either\r\nin Europe or Australasia; and, among other things, Hans was pointing out\r\nthe difficulty which existed in determining both the genera and species\r\nof all the _Crocodilidae_.\r\n\r\nWhile the yagers were listening to these details, the Kaffir, who had\r\nbeen squatted with his eyes bent upon the river, suddenly started from\r\nhis crouching attitude, and pointed down to the bank, toward a small\r\nbrake of reeds that grew out of the water.\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned in that direction, and it was perceived that some\r\nof the reeds were shaking about, as if a large creature was moving among\r\nthem.  The reeds were nodding about and bending downward in bunches, and\r\nbreaking as if under some heavy pressure, and crackling as they broke.\r\nWhat could be causing such a commotion amongst them?  It did not appear\r\nlike the natural motion of any wild animal, for these glide about, even\r\nin their undisturbed haunts, in a stealthy and easy manner.  There was\r\nsomething unusual going on among the reeds.  What could it be?\r\n\r\nThe young yagers were determined to find out; and for this purpose they\r\ndrew near the margin of the reeds.  They did not approach them openly,\r\nbut crawled forward under cover of the grass and bushes, observing\r\nperfect silence, so as not to fright away whatever creature was causing\r\nthe movement.\r\n\r\nFortunately the reed-culms did not grow so thickly as to obscure the\r\nview; and when near, it was possible to see a large object moving in\r\ntheir midst.  And a large object _was_ seen--a large dark creature which\r\nwas at once recognised as a crocodile.\r\n\r\nIt might have been another crocodile, and not that which had just\r\ndrowned the waterbuck; but the hunters were not left to conjecture on\r\nthis point, for, while watching its movements, they now perceived the\r\ncarcass of the waterbuck itself, which the huge reptile was dragging up\r\namong the reeds, evidently with the intention of raising it out of the\r\nwater!  For this purpose it was using its powerful jaws, as well as its\r\nsnout, and strong forearms--now pulling the body along a bit, then\r\npushing and rolling it over towards the bank.\r\n\r\nThe boys watched these strange manoeuvres for some moments in silence;\r\nbut Groot Willem had brought his gun with him, and choosing a moment\r\nwhen the huge saurian was resting a little, he aimed for the socket of\r\nits eyeball, and sent the big bullet of his roer crashing through its\r\nskull.\r\n\r\nThe reptile plunged back into the river, and went to the bottom leaving\r\nthe wave tinged with blood.  Presently it rose to the surface,\r\nstruggling violently, and evidently in great agony.  Now it raised the\r\nfore-part of its hideous body quite out of the water; then its head went\r\nunder, and its long tail was flouted into the air; then up came its head\r\nagain, and so on, till at length its struggles ceased, and it sank to\r\nthe bottom like a stone.  No doubt it sank to rise no more.\r\n\r\nCongo and Swartboy rushed in among the reeds, and drawing out the\r\nwaterbuck--somewhat lacerated by the teeth of its destroyer--dragged it\r\nin triumph to the camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE GUINEA-HENS.\r\n\r\nAlthough Swartboy and Congo supped upon the flesh of the waterbuck--\r\nwhich is far from being a delicate venison--the boys had something\r\nbetter for supper.  That was roast fowl, and a very dainty kind of it,\r\nquite equal to grouse or partridge.  They all supped upon \"guinea-hen.\"\r\n\r\nThe guinea-fowl (_Numida meleagris_) is a bird that has been long known,\r\nand is often mentioned in the works of ancient writers under the names\r\n_Meleagris_ and _Gallina Numidica_.  It is unnecessary to give a\r\ndescription of its appearance, as every one is acquainted with the\r\nbeautiful pearly plumage of the bird, from which it has obtained the\r\nname of pearl-hen--among the Germans Perl-Huhn, and among the Spaniards\r\n\"Pintado,\" or spotted hen.  The English name \"Guinea-hen\" is in allusion\r\nto the country from which it has been chiefly obtained in modern times.\r\nThe guinea-fowl is truly a native of Africa--though it is now\r\ndomesticated in almost every country in the world, and has become a\r\ncommon inhabitant of the farm-yard.  In the United States of America,\r\nparticularly in the Southern States, where the climate exactly suits it,\r\nthe guinea-hen, or \"guinea-chicken,\" as the bird is there called, is a\r\ngreat favourite, both as a bird for the table and a layer of eggs; and\r\ncertainly the flesh of the young pullet is much more delicate and\r\nsavoury than that of the common fowl.\r\n\r\nIn many of the West India islands, the guinea-hen, although introduced\r\nfrom Africa, has become wild, and in the forests of Jamaica it is hunted\r\nand shot like other game.  In these islands the species propagates very\r\nrapidly; and where the birds become numerous they do great mischief to\r\nthe crops of the planters.  On this account they are often hunted, not\r\nto be served up at the table, but for the purpose of exterminating them\r\nas troublesome pests.\r\n\r\nThroughout all Africa, its native country, the guinea-fowl exists; but\r\nit is to be remarked that there is more than one species.  The common\r\nguinea-fowl (_Numida meleagris_) is the best known, and in its wild\r\nstate differs very little from the domesticated variety.  The latter,\r\nhowever, frequently varies in colour, and some are seen with very little\r\nof the blue tint upon their feathers and almost without spots.  This,\r\nhowever, is the usual law of wild birds when produced under\r\ndomestication, as ducks, turkeys, geese, and all the other pets of the\r\nfarm, fully demonstrate.  Even when left to herself, nature often\r\n\"sports\" in this way, and we know of no bird or animal of which\r\n\"albinos\" may not be at some time observed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the common guinea-fowl, a second species is well known to\r\nexist in the Southern parts of the African continent.  This is the\r\n\"crested guinea-fowl,\" (_Numida cristata_).  It is not quite so large as\r\nthe common kind, and has other differences.  It is of a darker blue\r\ncolour, but spotted like its congener, each feather having from four to\r\nsix spots upon it.  The quills are yellowish brown, but the edges of the\r\nsecondaries are of a pure white, which contrasts prettily with the dark\r\ncolouring of the general plumage.\r\n\r\nBut the most conspicuous difference between the two species is in the\r\nformation of the crown and cheeks.  As is well known, over the bill of\r\nthe common guinea-fowl rises a singular warty membrane like a casque,\r\nwhile two carunculated wattles hang from the lower mandible.  Both these\r\nappendages are wanting in the _Numida cristata_; but in place of the\r\nhard casque, the head of this species is ornamented with a crest of\r\nloose hair-like feathers of a bluish-black, which adds very much to the\r\nelegant appearance of the bird.\r\n\r\nThe guinea-hens are gregarious and sometimes immense flocks of them are\r\nseen together.  They spend most of their time upon the ground, but they\r\nalso take to trees when startled, and roost upon the branches.  Their\r\nfood consists of seeds, berries, and soft slugs.\r\n\r\nWhile the boys were discussing what they should have for supper, a flock\r\nof these beautiful crested creatures came chattering across the open\r\nmeadow in which was the camp.  Of course the shot-guns were immediately\r\nput in requisition, and several of the party got ready to go after them.\r\n\r\nNow it is not so very easy to get a shot at the wild guinea-hens.  They\r\nare no great flyers, and do not take to the wing when pursued, unless\r\nwhen close pressed by a dog or some other swift animal.  But a man on\r\nfoot is no match for them, as they run very swiftly where the ground is\r\neven.  They are shy, moreover; and it is not without difficulty that a\r\nshot can be had.  There is one way, however, of approaching them\r\nsuccessfully.  A dog should be set after them, precisely in the same\r\nmanner as though they were rabbits, hares, or any other small\r\nquadrupeds.  The dog of course being swift enough to overtake them, soon\r\ncomes up, and the guinea-fowls are then forced to take wing.  But, as\r\nthey are greatly disinclined to a long flight, they soon settle down\r\nagain, or, what is more likely, perch upon the branches of the nearest\r\ntree.  The dog then runs up to the tree; and, if well-trained, will\r\ncommence barking, and continue so till the sportsman approaches within\r\nshot.  The birds upon the tree have no fear of the dog below--knowing\r\nvery well that he cannot climb up to them--but, while their attention is\r\noccupied with him, they pay no heed to their more dangerous enemy the\r\ngunner, who can then easily approach within range, and take aim at his\r\nleisure.\r\n\r\nNow this mode of hunting the guinea-fowl was well known to the young\r\nyagers; and as one of their dogs had been trained to it, they took him\r\nalong, and commenced the pursuit with every confidence that they would\r\neat roast fowl for supper.\r\n\r\nThey were not disappointed.  The birds were soon after sprung, and then\r\ntreed; and the barking of the dog conducted the gunners to the spot\r\nwhere the game had taken roost, among the branches of some\r\n\"cameel-doorn\" trees near the bank of the river.  Several shots were\r\nobtained; and three brace and a half were brought into camp--enough to\r\nserve not only for supper, but also for breakfast on the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to be quite a place for birds; for while there, many other\r\nspecies were observed by the young hunters.  A great many curious plants\r\ngrew in the neighbourhood, the seeds of which served many kinds for\r\nfood; besides, from the proximity of the river many flies and other\r\ninsects were produced, the prey of numerous shrikes and other birds of\r\nthe family of _Muscicapidae_.\r\n\r\nHans pointed out a very singular bird that was flying about the meadow,\r\nand was every now and then uttering a note that sounded like the word\r\n\"edolio.\"  From this note the bird derives its name, just as in England\r\nthe \"cuckoo\" is named from its peculiar call, and in France \"coucou.\"\r\n\r\nNow the _edolio_ of South Africa is also a cuckoo; and although\r\ndiffering from our cuckoo in some respects, it has a great resemblance\r\nto it in others.  It has the same parasite peculiarity of depositing its\r\neggs in the nests of other birds, and leaving them to be hatched there;\r\nand its other habits are very similar to those of the common cuckoo.\r\n\r\nBut there are some very curious points in the history of the \"edolio,\"\r\nwhich it does not share with its European congener.  Among the boors of\r\nSouth Africa it is known as the \"New year's day bird,\" (Niuwe jaars\r\nvogel,) and these simple people ascribe to it some wonderful\r\ncharacteristics.  They say that it appears only at the beginning of the\r\nyear--whence the name \"new year's day bird\"--and that whenever it is\r\nhungry it commences to cry out, and then all the little birds in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood fly towards it, carrying food, which they give\r\nit to eat!\r\n\r\nNow all the young yagers, as well as Congo the Kaffir and Swartboy the\r\nBushman, were well acquainted with this story; and all, with the\r\nexception of Hans, believed it to be true.  Hans, however, knew the\r\nexplanation of the marvellous matter, and proceeded to give it to his\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nHe stated that the bird known among the farmers as the _Niuwe jaars\r\nvogel_, was no other than the young of the \"edolio\" (_Cuculus\r\nserratus_)--though the farmers would not believe this, because, although\r\nfull fledged, it differs a good deal from the parent birds both in size\r\nand colour, and is therefore taken for a distinct kind.  That the\r\nmystery of its appearing always on the first day of the year, was scarce\r\na fable after all, as it was _about_ that time that young edolios\r\nobtained their full feathers, and commenced flying about.  That the\r\nfurther statement, of its crying out when hungry, was perfectly true;\r\nbut that _all_ the small birds in the neighbourhood were summoned by its\r\ncry, was not correct, although _some_ would be, viz: the step-mother and\r\nfather that had brought it into life; and that these having been often\r\nseen in the act of feeding the young edolio had given origin to the\r\nfable.  This was certainly a very good explanation.\r\n\r\nHans further stated that a similar belief existed among the natives of\r\nIndia, in relation to the large-billed cuckoo, (_Eudynamis orientalis_),\r\nand that the belief had a similar origin.\r\n\r\n\"The edolio,\" continued Hans, \"like the cuckoo, deposits its eggs in the\r\nnest of many species of small birds; and that it places them there with\r\nits beak, and not in the ordinary way, has been satisfactorily\r\ndetermined by naturalists.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY TWO.\r\n\r\nROOYEBOK.\r\n\r\nAs our travellers advanced up-stream, the wide level plains became\r\nnarrowed into mere stripes of meadow that lay along both sides of the\r\nriver.  On both sides, and not a great distance off, wood-covered\r\nmountains trended parallel to the course of the stream.  Sometimes their\r\nspurs approached very near to the banks--so as to divide the bottom land\r\ninto a series of valleys, that rose like terraces one above the other.\r\nEach of these was a separate plain, stretching from the river's bank to\r\nthe rocky foot of the mountain.\r\n\r\nNearly every one of them was tenanted with game of one sort or another--\r\nsuch as had already been met with on the route--but beyond killing\r\nenough to keep their larder supplied with fresh meat, our party did not\r\nmake any stay to hunt here.  The guide had informed them, that beyond\r\nthe mountain where the river took its rise lay the country of the\r\nelephant, the buffalo, and the giraffe; and in hopes of reaching this\r\nlong-expected land, the sight of a herd of springboks, or gnoos, or\r\nblauw-boks, or even elands, had little more interest for the young\r\nyagers than if it had been a drove of tame oxen.\r\n\r\nAscending into one of the upper valleys, however, they came suddenly in\r\nview of a herd of antelopes whose forms and colours distinguished them\r\nfrom any our hunters had yet met with.  This at once decided them to\r\nhalt the wagons, and prepare for a chase.\r\n\r\nThat the animals seen were antelopes, there could be no mistake.  They\r\nhad all the grace and lightness of form peculiar to these creatures;\r\nbesides, their horns were conspicuously characteristic.  Their\r\nappearance bespoke them to be true antelopes.\r\n\r\nThey were large ones too--that is, of medium size--about as large as red\r\ndeer; but of course small when compared with such species as the\r\nblauw-bok or the huge eland.  Each would have measured nearly three feet\r\nand a half in height--and even a little more, over the croup--for\r\nalthough there are some antelopes, such as those of the _acronotine_\r\ngroup--the \"hartebeest,\" \"sassabye,\" and \"bekr-el-wash\"--that stand\r\nlower at the croup than the shoulders, the reverse is the case with\r\nother species; and those now before the eyes of our hunters possessed\r\nthe latter characteristic.  They stood high at the croup.\r\n\r\nNone of the yagers had ever seen one of the kind before; and yet, the\r\nmoment they came under view, both Hendrik and Groot Willem cried out--\r\n\r\n\"Rooyebok!\"\r\n\r\n\"How know you that they are rooyebok?\" demanded Hans.\r\n\r\n\"From their colour, of course,\" replied the others.\r\n\r\nThe colour of these antelopes was a deep fulvous red over the head,\r\nneck, and upper parts of the body; paler along the sides; and under the\r\nbelly pure white.  There were some black marks--such as a stripe of\r\nblack down each buttock, and also along the upper part of the tail--but\r\nthe general colour of the animals was bright red; hence their being\r\ntaken for \"rooyebok,\" or \"red-bucks,\" by Hendrik and Groot Willem.\r\n\r\n\"The colour is not a good criterion,\" remarked Hans.  \"They might as\r\nwell have been `grysbok,' or `steinbok,' or `rooye rheebok,' for the\r\nmatter of colour.  I judge by the horns, however, that you are right in\r\nyour guess.  They _are_ rooyebok, or, as the Bechuanas call them,\r\n`pallah,' and, as naturalists style them, _Antilope melampus_.\"\r\n\r\nAll looked at the horns as Hans spoke, and saw that these were full\r\ntwenty inches in length, and somewhat like those of the springbok, but\r\nmore irregularly lyrate.  The two nearly met at their tips, whereas at\r\ntheir middle they were full twelve inches apart.  This was a\r\ncharacteristic by which they could easily be remembered, and it had\r\nenabled Hans at once to pronounce upon the species.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, there was but one pair of full-grown horns in the whole\r\nherd, for there was but one old buck, and the does of the pallah are\r\nhornless.  A \"herd\" is hardly a proper term; for this species of\r\nantelope cannot be called gregarious.  What our hunters saw before them\r\nwas a _family_ of rooyeboks, consisting of the old male, his wives, and\r\nseveral young bucks and does--in all, only eleven in number.\r\n\r\nOur hunters knew, from what they had heard, that the rooyebok is both a\r\nshy and swift antelope--difficult either to be approached or run down.\r\nIt would be necessary, therefore, to adopt some plan of proceeding, else\r\nthey would not succeed in getting one of them; and they had fixed their\r\nminds most covetously on the large knotted horns of the buck.  They\r\nhalted the wagons to await the result of the chase; though the oxen were\r\nnot to be outspanned, unless it should prove successful.  If so, they\r\nwould camp upon the ground for the night--so as to enable them to dress\r\nthe meat, and preserve the \"trophies.\"  With such resolves, they made\r\nready to hunt the pallah.\r\n\r\nUpon first coming in sight of the rooyebok, the hunters were upon the\r\ncrest of a high ridge--one of the mountain-spurs, that divided the\r\nvalley they had just traversed from that in which the red antelopes were\r\nfeeding.  From the eminence they occupied, they commanded a view of this\r\nvalley to its farthest border, and could see its whole surface, except a\r\nsmall strip on the nearer side, which was hidden from them by the brow\r\nof the ridge on which they stood.\r\n\r\nAround the sides of the valley there were trees and bushes; though these\r\ndid not form a continued grove, but only grew in detached clumps and\r\npatches.  All the central ground, where the pallahs were feeding, was\r\nopen, and quite destitute of either bush or cover of any kind.  Between\r\nthe bordering groves there was long grass; and, by the aid of this, a\r\nskilled hunter might have crept from one grove to another, without\r\nattracting the attention of the antelopes.\r\n\r\nIt was decided, therefore, that Hendrik and Groot Willem should steal\r\nround to the other end of the valley, keeping under cover of the\r\nthickets and grass.  Then the pallahs would be between two fires, as\r\nthey must either go up or down the valley in trying to escape.  On the\r\nright lay the steep mountain; on the left, the deep rapid river.  They\r\nwould not likely attempt to move off on either hand.  So this design to\r\nintercept them was good enough.\r\n\r\nThe horses were now tied to trees and left on the back of the ridge,\r\nwhile the hunters moved forward upon the brow that overhung the valley.\r\n\r\nThey had not advanced far before that part of the valley hitherto unseen\r\ncame under their eyes, and there, to their astonishment, another herd of\r\nanimals appeared; not of antelopes--although, from their colour, they\r\nmight have been mistaken for such.  No--the short round heads, elongated\r\nbodies, thick massive limbs, and long tufted tails, told at a glance,\r\nthat it was no herd of peaceful ruminants the hunters were gazing upon,\r\nbut an assemblage of dreaded _carnivora_--a troop of lions!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY THREE.\r\n\r\nFOUR-FOOTED HUNTERS.\r\n\r\nThere were twelve lions in the troop--old males, females, and whelps of\r\ndifferent ages!  A terrific spectacle to look upon, in any other way\r\nthan through the bars of a cage, or out of a third story window.  But\r\nour young yagers beheld them on an open plain, and at the dangerous\r\nproximity of three hundred yards!\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that a sudden stop was put to their advance, and\r\nthat every one of the six was more or less alarmed.  Although they knew\r\nthat, as a general rule, the lion will not attack man without\r\nprovocation, it might be different where such a number were together.\r\nTwelve lions would have made short work of them, one and all.  No wonder\r\nthe young hunters trembled at sight of such a troop, and so near; for\r\nthe brow of the ridge, running abruptly down to the plain, was all that\r\nlay between them and the dreaded assemblage.  A few bounds would have\r\nbrought the lions to the spot on which they stood!\r\n\r\nAfter the first moments of surprise and alarm had passed, the yagers\r\nbethought themselves how to act.  Of course, the pallahs were driven\r\ncompletely out of their mind, and all ideas of a hunt given up.  To have\r\ndescended into that valley, would have been to have encountered twice\r\ntheir own number of lions: older hunters than they would have shied off\r\nfrom such an encounter.  They did not think for a moment of going\r\nfarther, nor, indeed, of any thing but retreating; and it cannot be said\r\nthat they _thought_ of that, for it was the instinct of the moment.\r\n\r\n\"Back to our horses!\" whispered they to one another, the moment they set\r\ntheir eyes on the lions; and, without staying to contemplate the fearful\r\ngroup, all six stole back; and, in less than two minutes' time, were\r\nseated in their saddles.\r\n\r\nTheir presence had not been discovered by the lions.  Two circumstances\r\nhad favoured the boys, and prevented this.  The ridge over which they\r\nwere passing was covered with underwood, and the \"bosch,\" reaching as\r\nhigh as their heads, had sheltered them from view.  The other\r\ncircumstance in their favour was that the wind was blowing _down_ the\r\nvalley, and therefore, _from_ the lions and towards themselves.  Had it\r\nbeen otherwise, they would have been scented, and of course, discovered.\r\nStill another circumstance--the hunters had been advancing in silence,\r\non account of the design they had formed of stalking the pallahs.  The\r\nlions, therefore, still remained ignorant of their proximity.  Once on\r\nhorseback our party felt secure, and soon got over their little\r\n\"flurry.\"  Each knew that the noble creature that carried him, could\r\ngive any lion the heels.  Even the ponies of Klaas and Jan could run\r\naway from the fastest lion in Africa.  Once mounted, all felt that the\r\ndanger was over.\r\n\r\nThe hunters, Hendrik and Groot Willem, were not satisfied to retreat in\r\nthis way.  They were resolved on at least, having another \"peep\" at the\r\ndangerous game; and, therefore, prepared to return to their former point\r\nof observation, of course this time on horseback.  Hans also felt a\r\nsimilar inclination--from the desire to study a chapter of natural\r\nhistory--and Arend would go out of curiosity.  It was not deemed safe to\r\ntake Klaas or Jan along; so these two youngsters were unceremoniously\r\nsent back to the wagons, that had been halted in the lower valley near\r\nthe bottom of the hill.\r\n\r\nThe other four rode slowly and silently forward, until they came once\r\nmore in view of the valley, the herd of pallahs, and the troop of lions.\r\n\r\nThe antelopes were still feeding quietly near the centre of the open\r\nground.  The lions were as yet on the ground, where they had been first\r\nobserved.  That the pallahs knew nothing of the proximity of their\r\ndangerous neighbours was very evident, else they would not have been\r\nmoving so sedately along the sward.  They had no suspicion that an enemy\r\nwas near.  The lions were in the lower end of the valley, and therefore\r\nto leeward of them--for the wind was blowing fair downstream, and came\r\nright in the faces of the hunters.  A thicket, moreover, screened the\r\nlions from the eyes of the herd.\r\n\r\nIt was equally evident that the beasts of prey were well aware of the\r\npresence of the rooyeboks.  Their actions proved this.  At short\r\nintervals one trotted to the edge of the \"bosch,\" in crouching attitude,\r\nlooked out to the open plain, and after a moment or two returned to his\r\ncompanions, just as if he had been sent to \"report.\"  The old males and\r\nthe lionesses stood in a thick clump, and seemed to be holding a\r\nconsultation!  The boys had not a doubt but that they were doing this\r\nvery thing, and that the subject of their deliberation was the rooyebok\r\nherd.\r\n\r\nAt length the \"council\" appeared to break up.  The troop separated, each\r\ntaking a different direction.  Some went along the bottom of the valley,\r\nwhile several were seen to proceed towards the mountain foot.\r\n\r\nWhen these last had reached the groves before mentioned, they turned\r\nupwards; and one after another were seen crouching from clump to clump,\r\ncrawling along upon their bellies, as they passed through the long\r\ngrass, and evidently trying to shelter themselves from the view of the\r\npallahs.\r\n\r\nTheir object now became clear.  They were proceeding to the upper end of\r\nthe valley, with the design of driving the game upon those that had\r\nremained below--in fact, carrying out the identical plan which the\r\nhunters themselves had projected but the moment before!  The boys\r\nmarvelled at this singular coincidence; and as they sat in their saddles\r\nthey could not help admiring the skill with which their _rivals_ were\r\ncarrying out their own plan.\r\n\r\nThose--three there were--that had gone skulking up the edge of the\r\nvalley, were soon out of sight--hidden under the \"bosch\" that grew at\r\nthe opposite end, and which they had been seen to enter.  Meanwhile, the\r\nother nine had spread themselves along the bottom of the valley, each\r\ntaking station under cover of the bushes and long grass.  The trap was\r\nnow fairly set.\r\n\r\nFor a few minutes no movement was observed on the part either of lions\r\nor pallahs.  The former lay crouched and stealthily watching the herd--\r\nthe latter browsed peacefully along the sward, perfectly unconscious of\r\nthe plot that was \"thickening\" around them.\r\n\r\nSomething at this moment seemed to render them suspicious.  They\r\nappeared to suspect that there was danger threatening.  The buck raised\r\nhis head; looked around him; uttered a hiss, somewhat like the whistling\r\nof deer; and struck the ground a smart rap or two with his hoof.  The\r\nothers left off browsing, and several of them were seen to bound up into\r\nthe air--after the very singular manner of springboks.\r\n\r\nNo doubt they had scented the lions, now at the upper end of the\r\nvalley--as the breeze from that quarter blew directly towards the herd.\r\n\r\nIt was surely that; for after repeating his signal, the old buck himself\r\nsprang many feet into the air, and then stretched himself in full\r\nflight.  The others of course followed, leaping up at intervals as they\r\nran.\r\n\r\nAs the lions had well calculated, the antelopes came directly down the\r\nvalley, breast forward, upon their line.  Neither the wind nor any thing\r\nwarned them of the dangerous ambuscade; and in a few short moments they\r\nwere close to the patches of brushwood.  Then the nine huge cats were\r\nseen to spring out as if moved by one impulse, and launch themselves\r\ninto the air.  Each had chosen a rooyebok, and nearly every one\r\nsucceeded in bringing his victim to the earth.  A single blow from the\r\npaw of their strong assailants was enough to stretch the poor antelopes\r\non the plain, and put an end at once to their running and their lives.\r\nSo sudden was the attack, and so short-lived the struggle, that in two\r\nseconds from the time the lions made their spring, each might be seen\r\ncrouching over a dead pallah, with his paws and teeth buried in its\r\nflesh!\r\n\r\nThree alone escaped, and ran back up the valley.  But a new ambush\r\nawaited them there; and as they followed the path, that led through the\r\nthicket at the upper end, each became the prey of a lurking lion.\r\n\r\nNot one of the beautiful antelopes, that but the moment before were\r\nbounding over the plain in all the pride and confidence of their speed,\r\nwas able to break through the line of deadly enemies so cunningly drawn\r\naround them!\r\n\r\nThe hunters remained for some minutes gazing upon the singular\r\nspectacle.  Hendrik and Groot Willem would have stolen forward, and sent\r\na brace of bullets into a brace of lions; but Hans would not hear of\r\nsuch a thing.  He alleged that there was no time when these animals are\r\nmore dangerous to attack, than just after they have killed their game\r\nand are drinking its blood.  At such a moment they are extremely\r\nferocious, and will follow with implacable vengeance any one who may\r\ndisturb them.  It would be more prudent, therefore, not to provoke such\r\na powerful band, but to retire altogether from the spot.\r\n\r\nTo these counsels of Hans--backed by Arend--the two hunters at length\r\nreluctantly yielded; and all four rode back to the wagons.\r\n\r\nArriving there, a consultation was held how they were to proceed.  It\r\nwould be a dangerous business to trek up the narrow valley guarded by\r\nsuch a troop.  A ford was therefore sought for, and found at some\r\ndistance below; and, having crossed their wagons, the travellers\r\nencamped on the opposite side--as it was too late to move farther that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThey had done well to go across the river, for during the whole night\r\nthe fierce brutes were heard roaring terrifically upon the side where\r\nthey had been observed.  In fact, the place appeared to be a regular\r\n_den of lions_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY FOUR.\r\n\r\n\"WIDOW-BIRDS.\"\r\n\r\nThey were only too glad to get off out of that neighbourhood, and at an\r\nearly hour they inspanned and treked up the banks of the stream.\r\n\r\nJust as on the other side, the road led through a succession of valleys,\r\nwith groves of trees scattered over their surface; and as they\r\nproceeded, the mountain-spurs more frequently approached the banks, and\r\nat one or two places they found great difficulty in getting the wagons\r\nacross the ridges.  One of these was so steep, that for a while the\r\ntravellers feared they would not be able to follow the stream any\r\nfarther.  The oxen refused to trek up the declivity, and neither whip\r\nnor jambok would force them forward.\r\n\r\nBut Congo knew of a plan by which they were at length induced to\r\nproceed; and both wagons arrived in safety at the top of the pass--not,\r\nhowever, until Swartboy had clicked and shouted, and Congo had screamed,\r\ntill their throats were sore, and both had worn the voorslays of\r\nspringbok skin from their long whips.\r\n\r\nCongo's mode of making the oxen move forward was a very simple one; and\r\nconsisted in his going ahead of them and smearing the rocks along the\r\npath with the \"mest\" of the oxen themselves--thus leading the animals to\r\nbelieve that other oxen had gone before them, and that therefore the\r\npassage must be practicable, since some of their own kind had already\r\nmade it!  This mode is often adopted by the trek-boors of Southern\r\nAfrica, when they wish to drive up very precipitous places, where the\r\noxen are afraid to go of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe valley, which was reached after climbing through this difficult\r\npass, was one of very small extent--not exceeding a couple of acres; and\r\nas the river had now become diminished to a mountain-stream, it was\r\nfordable at any point throughout the whole length of the little meadow\r\nin which the travellers encamped.  At the head of this valley a ridge\r\ntrended across the course of the stream through which the current had\r\ncleft a wide way; and the only road leading out above was along the\r\nchannel of the river itself.  Fortunately, this channel was nearly dry,\r\nelse they could have gone no farther in that direction.  As it was, the\r\npebbly bed of the stream could be traversed by wagons, and they would\r\neasily get through to wider plains that stretched beyond.  They had\r\nhalted for the night in this little valley, because there was excellent\r\ngrass for their cattle; and as wood grew along the sides of the rocky\r\nhills, and clear cool water ran down the stream, they possessed all the\r\nthree necessary requisites for a traveller's camp.\r\n\r\nIt was a curious little place where they had outspanned.  As already\r\nstated, the level ground was not over a couple of acres in extent,\r\nthough it was nearly of circular form.  Through the very centre of it\r\npassed the stream, its bed being only a few feet below the general\r\nsurface; and all around were the mountains, their precipitous sides\r\nrising like rocky walls to a height of several hundred feet, and\r\ncompletely enclosing the mountain within their embrace.\r\n\r\nThere were no trees upon the surface of the meadow itself, but against\r\nthe rocks grew many kinds; some of them hanging with their tops\r\ndownward, and some stretching horizontally outwards.  A few small shrubs\r\nalone, with some reeds, grew upon the edge of the stream; but these were\r\nlow, and would not have concealed a man standing erect.\r\n\r\nIn the centre of this natural amphitheatre the camp was formed--that is,\r\nthe wagons were placed there.  The horses and oxen were not fastened in\r\nany way, as it was supposed they would not care to stray out of the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nThere were three good reasons why they should not wander.  First,\r\nbecause they were wearied with a long day's work, and one that had been\r\nparticularly severe.  Secondly, the paths leading out were difficult to\r\nfind.  And thirdly, because both the grass and water there were of as\r\ngood a quality as either horse or ox could have expected to meet with\r\nelsewhere.  There was no reason, therefore, why any of them should go\r\nbeyond the confines of the valley where the camp was situated.\r\n\r\nAs usual, no sooner were Klaas and Jan fairly out of their saddles than\r\nthey went bird's-nesting.  Several kinds of birds had been seen by them\r\nas they entered this secluded valley; and it was likely that some of\r\ntheir nests would be found at no great distance off.\r\n\r\nAnd some were found.  Upon the shrubs and reeds quite a colony of birds\r\nhad made their habitations.  They were small sparrow-looking birds,\r\nhaving nests of a kidney-shape, hollow in the inside, which was reached\r\nby little circular entrances, something like the nests of the common\r\nwren.  The outside part was constructed of grass; while inside, the\r\nnests were lined with a soft substance resembling wool.  This was the\r\ncottony down obtained from some plant that, no doubt, grew in that\r\nneighbourhood, but which the boys could not see anywhere around.\r\n\r\nNow these little birds were already well known to the young yagers.\r\nThey had met with them before; and all of them knew they were birds of\r\nthe genus _Ploceinae_, or weaver-birds.  They knew, moreover, that there\r\nare not only many species of weaver-birds, but that there are also many\r\n_genera_, or rather _subgenera_, of them, differing from each other in\r\nsize, colour, and habits, but all possessing the curious instinct of\r\nbuilding nests of a very ingenious kind--in other words \"weaving\" them;\r\nfrom which circumstance they derive their trivial name.  The nests of\r\nall the species differ from each other.  Some are constructed of a\r\nglobe-shape; others like a chemist's retort; others of kidney-form; and\r\nstill another kind of nest is that of the \"social weaver-birds.\"  These\r\nlast unite in large numbers, and fill one great nest, or \"hive,\" which\r\noften fills the whole top of a great acacia, looking like a haystack\r\nbuilt among the branches of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe little weavers observed by Klaas and Jan were of the genus\r\n_Amadina_--the _Amadina squamifrons_; and both the boys were glad at\r\nencountering some of their nests at that moment.  Not that they were at\r\nall curious to see the eggs, for they had examined them often before.\r\nNo: that was not the reason.  There was another and a different one.  It\r\nwas this: the inside lining of the nest of the amadina makes excellent\r\nwadding for shot-guns--quite equal to tow, and even better than the\r\nsoftest paper; and as both Klaas and Jan were out of wadding, they\r\nexpected to replenish their stock by robbing the poor amadinas of their\r\npretty nests.\r\n\r\nThey would not have done so wantonly, for Hans would not have permitted\r\nthem; but, as hunters, they stood in real need of the article, and\r\ntherefore they took it without remorse.\r\n\r\nSimple as the thing was, they were compelled to unravel the nests before\r\nthey could get at the soft material with which they were lined: and this\r\nunravelling was not done without some difficulty, for the outside work\r\nwas woven together like the rods in a fine piece of basket-work.  The\r\nentrance which the bird had left for its own passage in and out was so\r\nsmall, that the boys could not thrust their hands into it; and, what was\r\nsingular, this entrance, whenever the bird was absent from the nest, was\r\nso closed up that it was difficult to find it!\r\n\r\nHaving obtained as much wadding as they required out of a pair of nests,\r\nthe boys did not disturb any of the others; but permitting them to hang\r\nwhere they had found them, returned to the wagons.\r\n\r\nThey had not been long there before their attention was attracted to\r\nanother bird, and one of a rarer and more curious kind than the amadina.\r\nIt did not differ much from the latter in point of size, but in the\r\nnature and colour of its plumage--which was most curious indeed.  The\r\nbird which now occupied the attention, not only of Klaas and Jan, but of\r\nall the others, was about the size of a canary-bird; but its long\r\ntail-feathers, several times the length of its body, gave it the\r\nappearance of being much larger than it really was.\r\n\r\nIts colour was of a very dark glossy brown, or nearly black, upon the\r\nhead and over the upper parts of the body.  Around the neck was a collar\r\nof orange rufous, which grew paler upon the breast, ending in a buff\r\ntinge over the abdomen, lower parts of the body, and thighs.\r\n\r\nBut it was in the tail-feathers that the peculiarity of this bird\r\nappeared.  Of these, two were immensely long, set vertically, or\r\n\"edgeways,\" and curving far outward and downward.  Two others, much\r\nshorter, also stood out edgeways above the first.  These were broadly\r\nwebbed at their bases, being at their widest rail three inches across;\r\nwhile their tips, for the length of three inches more, were entirely\r\nwithout any feathery web, and looked like a pair of stiff hairy spines\r\nprojecting outward.  Besides these two pairs of vertical feathers, there\r\nwere four others on each side of the tail, nicely graduated one above\r\nthe other, each being about a quarter of an inch shorter than the one\r\nimmediately below it.  All these tail-feathers were black.\r\n\r\nBut one of these birds was seen by the boys at their camp; but they\r\nnoticed that it was accompanied by another bird of a rusty brown and\r\nwhitish colour, and with a tail of the ordinary kind.  This companion\r\nwas neither more nor less than the female; while the gaudy creature with\r\nthe orange colour and long tail-plumes was the male.\r\n\r\nHans's knowledge was now brought into requisition, for the others had\r\nnever seen this curious bird, and knew not to what species it belonged.\r\nHans told them it also was one of the weaver-birds; known among\r\nnaturalists by the name _Vidua_; among the French as \"La veuve;\" and\r\namong the English as \"Widow-bird.\"  All of the party regarded this as a\r\nvery singular name for the bird; and at once called upon the naturalist\r\nfor an explanation of it.  Fortunately, Hans was able to give them this;\r\nand that was more than the learned Brisson--he who baptised it _Vidua_\r\nand _La veuve_--has been able to do.\r\n\r\n\"Brisson,\" said Hans, \"has named the little creature `widow-bird,'\r\nbecause he had heard that it was so called among the Portuguese; and the\r\nFrench naturalist assigns as a reason that it was so called on account\r\nof its colour and long tail!  Such writers as Monsieur Brisson and\r\nMonsieur Buffon are never at a loss for reasons.  Now it so happens that\r\nneither its colour nor tail had any thing to do with the origin of its\r\nname `widow-bird,' which of itself is quite a misnomer.  The Portuguese,\r\nwho first drew attention to this bird, called it `Whidah' bird, from the\r\nfact that it was received by them from the kingdom of Whidah in Western\r\nAfrica.  That is the way in which the bird has received its\r\nappellation.\"\r\n\r\nThe Whidah-bird, on account of its livery habits, but more from the\r\nsingularity of its tail-plumes, is a great favourite as a pet: and is\r\noften seen in cages, where it hops from perch to perch without fear of\r\nconstraint, and alternately depresses and elevates its long tail with\r\ngreat vivacity.  It is usually fed upon grain and several kinds of\r\nherbs, and is exceedingly fond of bathing itself in water.  It moults\r\ntwice a year; and during one period the male loses the long plumes which\r\ndistinguish him from his mate, and altogether becomes so changed in\r\ncolour, that the sexes are not then very easily told apart.  It is only\r\nduring the breeding season that the cock Whidah-bird attains his fine\r\ntail, and the orange and black colours of his plumage.\r\n\r\nThere are two species of Whidah-birds known to naturalists.  The\r\n\"Paradise widow-bird\" (_Vidua paradisea_) is the one described above;\r\nand another which is called the \"Red-billed widow-bird,\" (_Vidua\r\nerythrorhynca_).  The latter is a smaller species, and differs from the\r\nother in the arrangement of the tail-feathers.  Its bill is of a deep\r\nred colour--whence the trivial name; and its plumage is of a\r\nbluish-black upon the upper parts of the body, with a white collar\r\naround the neck, white wing coverts, and whitish underneath.\r\n\r\nIts habits, however, are precisely similar to those of the species\r\n_Paradisea_; and both are found inhabiting the same countries, viz:\r\nWestern Africa.  The range of neither reaches as far southward as the\r\nCape Colony, but one of the species extends to the countries northward\r\nof the great Orange River, and is occasionally, though rarely, seen.\r\n\r\nOn account of its rarity in these parts, the young yagers, and\r\nparticularly the naturalist Hans, were desirous of obtaining its skin;\r\nand for this purpose the shot-guns were levelled, and both the \"widows\"\r\nwere ruthlessly brought down from their perch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY FIVE.\r\n\r\nTHE PIQUE-BOEUFS.\r\n\r\nOf course Hans, aided by the others, immediately set about skinning the\r\nwidow-birds, with an eye to their being preserved.  Arend was his\r\nprincipal assistant, for Arend was clever with his hands; and was,\r\nmoreover, as good a taxidermist as Hans himself.  It never troubled\r\nArend to know the genus or species of a bird; but give him the bird\r\nitself, and he could strip off its skin and mount it without leaving a\r\ntrace of a ruffled feather.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged, a noise fell upon the ears of the young yagers that\r\ncaused all of them to start--Hans and Arend dropping the skins of the\r\nwidow-birds, upon which they had been operating.\r\n\r\nThe noise which produced this startling effect, was neither more nor\r\nless than the cry of a bird, and but a small bird at that.  The note\r\nvery much resembled the well-known call of the mistle-thrush or\r\nscreech-cock, (_Turdus viscivorus_).  It was no louder, and the bird\r\nthat uttered it was no bigger than this thrush; but for all that, the\r\nnote produced a somewhat terrifying effect upon the yager camp.  All of\r\nthe party, both yagers and attendants, knew the cry well.  Even the\r\nbuck-dogs sprang to their feet, and howled as it reached their ears; and\r\nthe whole camp was suddenly in a commotion.\r\n\r\nNow, my young reader, you will wonder why the cry of a bird, not bigger\r\nthan a blackbird, could create terror in the minds of such courageous\r\nboys as our yagers; and you will naturally desire to know what sort of\r\nbird this was.\r\n\r\nI have said the boys all knew it, the attendants and the dogs.  Nay,\r\nmore, the horses and oxen recognised that cry; and its effect on them\r\nwas not less wonderful; for the moment it was heard, the horses tossed\r\nup their heads, snorted as if in terror, and commenced _stampeding_ over\r\nthe ground.  The oxen exhibited similar symptoms of affright.  Yes,\r\nhorses, oxen, dogs, Kaffir, Bushman, and yagers, were all affected by\r\nthe screech of that bird, as it pealed along the rocks, and echoed\r\nthrough the glen.  All recognised in it the warning cry of the\r\n_Pique-Boeuf_!\r\n\r\nAn account of this singular bird will explain the cause of the\r\nconsternation which its note had thus suddenly produced.\r\n\r\nThe \"Pique-Boeuf\" is about the size of a starling, of a greyish colour\r\nover the body, with short wings, and tail somewhat of a darker hue.  Its\r\nfeet are formed for grasping, and its claws are hooked and compressed.\r\nThe most remarkable part of the bird is its bill.  This is of a\r\nquadrangular shape, the lower mandible much stronger than the upper one,\r\nand both swelling towards the tip, so as to resemble a forceps or\r\npincers.  The purpose of this formation will be seen, when we come to\r\nspeak of the habits of the bird.\r\n\r\nThese are, indeed, peculiar; and, by the laws of ornithology, stamp the\r\nPique-Boeufs as a distinct genus of birds.\r\n\r\nA celebrated French ornithologist, and a true _field naturalist_ as\r\nwell--Le Vaillant--thus describes the habits of these birds:--\r\n\r\n\"The bill of the Pique-Boeuf is fashioned as a pair of solid pincers, to\r\nfacilitate the raising out of the hides of quadrupeds the larvae of the\r\ngadflies, which are there deposited and nourished.  The species,\r\ntherefore, anxiously seek out the herds of oxen, of buffaloes, of\r\nantelopes--of all the quadrupeds, in short, upon which these gadflies\r\ndeposit their eggs.  It is while steadied, by a strong gripe of the\r\nclaws in the tough and hairy hide of these animals, that, with strong\r\nblows of the bill and powerful squeezes of the skin, at the place where\r\nthe bird perceives an elevation, which indicates the presence of a\r\nmaggot, he extracts it with effect.  The animals, accustomed to the\r\ntreatment, bear with the birds complacently, and apparently perceive the\r\nservice which they render them, in freeing them from these true\r\nparasites, which live at the expense of their proper substance.\"\r\n\r\nNow, there are many species of birds, as well as the Pique-Boeufs, that\r\nlead a very similar life, living principally upon the parasite insects\r\nthat infest the bodies of the larger quadrupeds, both wild and tame.  In\r\nAmerica, the \"cow-bunting\" (_Icterus pecoris_) is so termed from its\r\nhabit of feeding upon the parasite insects of cattle; and among other\r\nanimals it is a constant attendant upon the immense herds of buffaloes\r\nthat roam over the great American prairies.  Other species of icterus\r\nalso frequent the vast cattle-herds of the South American plains.\r\n\r\nThe red-billed weaver-bird (_Textor erythrorhynchus_) is equally the\r\ncompanion of the African buffalo; and any one who has visited an\r\nextensive sheep-pasture cannot fail to have observed the common starling\r\nperched upon the woolly backs of the sheep.  The white-necked crow\r\n(_Corvus albicollis_) is noted for similar practices, as well as several\r\nother species of _Corvidae_ and _Sturnidae_.  All of these kinds,\r\nhowever--the white-necked crow excepted--content themselves with only\r\ntaking away the parasites, which are attached to the skins of the\r\nanimals, or such as live among the hair and wool--none of the aforesaid\r\nbirds having in their bills the necessary strength for extracting the\r\nmaggots which are lodged beneath.  Now, with the Pique-Boeufs, there is\r\nno difficulty about this.  Their peculiar beaks enable them to penetrate\r\nthe toughest hides of the large quadrupeds; and although they also feed\r\nupon the ticks and other parasites that rest upon the surface, they\r\nprefer the larvae that lie beneath.  Hence, these birds are entitled to\r\nbe regarded as distinct from any of the others; and naturalists have\r\nformed them into a separate genus--the genus _Buphaga_, or\r\n\"beef-eaters.\"\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely necessary to point out the absurdity of this name, which\r\nseems to have been given from a misapprehension of the habits of the\r\nbirds.  The Pique-Boeuf is no beef-eater, but a \"beef-picker,\" if you\r\nwill, as the French phrase very properly expresses it.  But M. Brisson,\r\nwho gave the name, seems very much to have resembled his more celebrated\r\ncountryman--the great _closet naturalist_, Buffon--in ascribing such\r\nhabit to birds and animals as suited his fancy.\r\n\r\n_Buphaga_ is the name given, and so let it stand.\r\n\r\nOnly two species have been yet observed.  One is the _Buphaga\r\nerythrorhyncha_, or red-billed beef-eater--so called from the colour of\r\nits beak, which is a beautiful coral-red--while the more common species\r\nalready described has a yellow beak.  The latter is the _Buphaga\r\nAfricana_.  Both species are birds of Africa--the \"coral bill\" (_Bec\r\ncorail_) being also a native of the island of Madagascar.  The \"coral\r\nbill\" is smaller than the _Buphaga Africana_, and somewhat different\r\nfrom it in colour.  The tint of its plumage is more sombre.  The upper\r\nparts, head and throat, are of an ash-brown, glazed, as it were, with\r\nbluish; and beneath, the bird is of a yellowish rust colour.  Its bill,\r\nalso, is smaller and less powerful than that of its congener.\r\n\r\nThe Pique-Boeufs are generally seen in company; but they never fly in\r\nlarge flocks.  Six or eight of them may usually be observed together.\r\nThey are very wild shy birds, and it is difficult to approach within\r\nshooting distance of them.\r\n\r\nThe only chance of getting near enough is to approach behind the body of\r\nan ox, or some other animal--using the latter as a stalking-horse, and\r\ndriving it gently towards those beasts on whose back the birds may be\r\nperched.  The gunner, by then showing himself suddenly, may obtain a\r\nshot at them on the wing.\r\n\r\nSuch are the habits of the Pique-Boeufs.  But all this does not explain\r\nwhy it was that the screech of one of these birds had thrown the camp of\r\nthe young yagers into such a state of excitement or alarm.  The reason\r\nremains to be told.  It was this:--\r\n\r\nOf all the quadrupeds to which the Pique-Boeufs attach themselves, there\r\nare none upon which they are such constant attendants as the rhinoceros.\r\nThis animal is the victim of many parasitical insects--of ticks and\r\nlarvae.  His huge body and corrugated skin, of such vast extent, offer\r\nan ample field for such creatures, and consequently afford a supply of\r\nfood to the Pique-Boeuf, which is unfailing.\r\n\r\nThe rhinoceroses, therefore, of all the four species that inhabit South\r\nAfrica, are always attended by the beef-eaters, which, on this account,\r\nare known among hunters as \"rhinoceros-birds.\"  Go where the rhinoceros\r\nwill, the Pique-Boeufs follow him, perching upon his back, his head, or\r\nany other part of his body, and remaining there quite unconcernedly, as\r\nif they regarded that situation as their natural roosting-place and\r\nhome.  The rhinoceros himself never dreams of molesting them.  On the\r\ncontrary, he finds their presence extremely useful to him.  Not only do\r\nthey give him ease, by destroying the insects that would otherwise annoy\r\nhim, but in another sense they do him an essential service.  They warn\r\nhim of the approach of the hunter, or any other danger.  The moment such\r\nappears, the rhinoceros, who himself may have been asleep, is instantly\r\naroused by the harsh screeching of the birds, and put upon his guard.\r\nShould their voices fail to awake him, these cunning sentinels will\r\nflutter around his head, and peck into his ears until they succeed in\r\ngiving the alarm.  With elephants and hippopotami they act in a similar\r\nmanner; so that one of the difficulties to be encountered by the hunter\r\nin pursuit of these animals, is the vigilance of the little winged\r\nsentinel that thus keeps watch over their sleep!\r\n\r\nIt was this curious habit, then--well known to every creature in the\r\ncamp--that caused all hands to start up on hearing the screech of the\r\nPique-Boeuf.  The presence of the bird announced the proximity of the\r\ndangerous \"rhinoster.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY SIX.\r\n\r\nCHARGED BY \"MUCHOCHOS.\"\r\n\r\nAll eyes were instantly turned in the direction whence came the \"skreek\"\r\nof the bird, and there, sure enough, were a brace of rhinoceroses of the\r\nbiggest kind.  They were just entering the little glen, through the gap\r\nbefore mentioned; and were coming down the channel of the river,\r\nplunging through the water as they walked knee-deep.\r\n\r\nThe superior size of their bodies, as well as their colour, told they\r\nwere white rhinoceroses; and the long horn upon the snout, pointing\r\nslightly backward instead of forward, showed they were of that species\r\nknown among the natives as \"muchocho,\" and among naturalists as\r\n_Rhinoceros simus_.\r\n\r\nThe other species of white rhinoceros is the \"kobaoba,\" lately named\r\n_Rhinoceros Oswellii_; although in my opinion it should have been\r\n_Rhinoceros Cummingii_--since the great lion-hunter was not only the\r\nfirst to give any definite characteristics of this rare species, but\r\nmore than any other man has he contributed to a knowledge of the South\r\nAfrican _fauna_.\r\n\r\nThe principal distinction between the kobaoba and muchocho is observed\r\nin the set and size of the horns.  In neither species is the posterior\r\nhorn any thing more than a conical knob of six or seven inches in\r\nlength; but in each the anterior horn is very long--far exceeding that\r\nof the black rhinoceroses.  In the kobaoba, this horn sometimes reaches\r\nto the enormous length of four feet, and even exceeds that measurement;\r\nwhile in the muchocho, three feet is the limit.  In the former the horn\r\nprojects forward, standing at an angle of forty-five degrees with the\r\nline of the snout; whereas that of the muchocho is erect, with a slight\r\ncurve or sweep backwards.\r\n\r\nBoth species far exceed in size the two kinds of black rhinoceros, and\r\nare fully equal to their great Asiatic congener--he with the curious\r\nshield-like skin, so well known in picture-books, museums, and\r\nzoological gardens.  In other words, the white rhinoceroses of South\r\nAfrica are in point of magnitude, after the elephant, the largest\r\nquadrupeds in the world.  In point of habits they differ altogether from\r\nthe black species.  They are grass-feeders, as the shape of their muzzle\r\ntestifies; while the black kinds browse upon various kinds of shrubs and\r\nacacia thorns, and are furnished with a prehensile lip for the purpose\r\nof more easily grasping the twigs and branches.\r\n\r\nAs has been elsewhere observed, in disposition the two kinds are also\r\nvery different.  The black rhinoceroses--both \"borele\" and \"keitloa\"--\r\nare of an extremely vicious and malignant nature, and more dangerous\r\neven than the lion.  They are swift of foot; and, but for their\r\ndefective powers of vision, it would be a perilous thing to approach\r\nthem.  The white species, on the contrary, are slow, and less disposed\r\nto make an attack upon man.  When these are wounded, or are accompanied\r\nby their young, the case is different.  They then exhibit all the\r\nferocity of their race; and many a native hunter has fallen a victim to\r\nthe rage of both the kobaoba and muchocho.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the two last-named species is excellent eating--being\r\nalmost as good as fresh pork.  It is not so with the flesh of the black\r\nrhinoceros, which is strong, rancid, and bitter.\r\n\r\nNow, knowing the general disposition of the \"muchochos,\" and knowing\r\nalso the delicate flesh which these animals afford to the hunter, our\r\nyoung yagers at seeing them lost all sense of alarm.  They at once\r\nrushed to their guns, and commenced preparing to receive the advancing\r\nquadrupeds.  Had it been boreles or keitloas, they would have acted\r\ndifferently; and would, perhaps, have thought only of flying to their\r\nhorses, or of ensconcing themselves in the wagons.  Of white\r\nrhinoceroses, however, they had no fear; and having armed themselves,\r\nthey advanced boldly and openly to the conflict.\r\n\r\nBy this time the muchochos had got fairly through the pass; and,\r\nclimbing out of the river-channel, stood up on the grassy sward of the\r\nmeadow.  Their naked bodies, thus fully exposed to view, appeared of\r\nenormous size.  One, however, was much bigger than the other--in fact,\r\nquite as large as a female elephant--for it was full sixteen feet in\r\nlength from the tip of its long blunt snout to the \"whisk\" upon the top\r\nof its short tail.\r\n\r\nBut what caused astonishment to the advancing hunters was the fact, that\r\ninstead of the two of these animals which they had already seen, three\r\nnow appeared upon the bank.  The third, however, was not larger than an\r\nordinary hog; and, excepting that its snout wanted the characteristic\r\nhorn, it might have passed for a miniature of the other two.  Small as\r\nit was, there was no mistaking it for any other animal than a\r\nrhinoceros; and its size as well as actions showed that it was the\r\nyoung, or \"calf,\" of the two old ones, that were respectively its male\r\nand female parent.\r\n\r\nThe hunters were delighted with this new discovery.  The flesh of the\r\nyoung white rhinoceros is much more delicate and tender than that of the\r\nfull-grown ones; and all of them, but particularly Swartboy and Congo,\r\nnow indulged in the anticipation of a rare treat.\r\n\r\nNo one thought of the increased danger of their thus attacking the\r\nrhinoceros in company with its young.  That was forgotten in the hurry\r\nand excitement of the moment.  The prudent Hans alone had some\r\nmisgivings; but carried away by the enthusiasm of his companions, he\r\nfailed to make them known.  In ten seconds afterwards a volley of\r\nreports rang through the little glen; and by that same volley a shower\r\nof bullets--varying in size from the large ounce-ball of the\r\nelephant-gun to the small pea of the rifle--was poured upon the\r\nmuchochos.\r\n\r\nThe only visible effect produced upon the animals was to cause them\r\nsuddenly to change their gait, from the slow waddle at which they had\r\nbeen advancing, to a brisk rapid gallop, which was directed precisely\r\ntoward the spot where the hunters were standing!  At the same time the\r\nhuge animals were heard to snort and blow like porpoises; and the\r\nsparkling of their small eyes, the quick lashing of their saucy tails,\r\nand the long horns set horizontally, showed that they were charging\r\nforward in the full bent of their fury.  The \"calf\" followed in the\r\nrear, imitating the noise and actions of its ponderous parents.\r\n\r\nThis to the hunters was a movement wholly unexpected.  Had it been\r\nborele or keitloa there would have been nothing strange in it.  On the\r\ncontrary, it was just as either of the black rhinoceroses would have\r\nacted.  But from muchocho--usually so harmless as to be called cowardly\r\nand stupid--an attack of this nature was quite unlooked for.  The report\r\nof a gun, or even the barking of a dog, will usually put the muchocho to\r\nflight.\r\n\r\nBut our yagers had not reasoned correctly when they expected these\r\neither to fall to their shots, or take to instant flight.  _They had\r\nforgotten the presence of the calf_.  That it was which caused the white\r\nrhinoceroses to act upon this occasion contrary to their usual habit--\r\nthat, and perhaps the wounds they had received--for several of the\r\nbullets, although not fatal, had made painful wounds.  So much the\r\nworse.\r\n\r\nOf course, none of the young yagers stood their ground to receive this\r\nheavy charge.  Their guns were now empty, and it would have been of no\r\nuse.  On the contrary, each and every one of them turned instanter; and\r\nno mischievous urchin ever ran faster from a parish beadle than did all\r\nsix of them towards the camp.  The tails of their coats made a\r\nconsiderable angle with the line of their backs, as they \"sloped\" across\r\nthe level sward of that little meadow.\r\n\r\nThe short thick Bushman and the tall lank Kaffir--both of whom had gone\r\nforth to the attack--were not a bit behind in the retreat; and the whole\r\neight were mingled together in such a helter-skelter pell-mell race, as\r\nhad never before been witnessed in that silent and solitary glen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY SEVEN.\r\n\r\nA RIDE UPON A RHINOCEROS.\r\n\r\nFortunately for all they were not distant from their wagons when thus\r\ncharged upon.  They had advanced only a few paces before delivering\r\ntheir fire, and these few paces were all they had to run back, before\r\nthey sprang up into the capacious vehicles.  Had it been otherwise--had\r\nthe chase only lasted twenty yards farther--most undoubtedly one or more\r\nof the party would have been hoisted upon the horns of the pursuing\r\nanimals, or trampled under their broad brutal hoofs.\r\n\r\nAs it was, the hindmost of them had a narrow escape of it; for they had\r\nhardly taken shelter under the cap-tents of the wagons, when the horns\r\nof the muchochos were heard rattling against the planks.\r\n\r\nAlthough they had fled to the wagons for want of a better place, they\r\nwere far from feeling secure.  They knew that these immense brutes,\r\nshould they take it into their heads, could soon demolish the vehicles,\r\nstrong as these were.  What was their consternation, then, at seeing the\r\nold bull suddenly lower his head, and charge forward upon one of the\r\nwagons, in which several of them had taken refuge!\r\n\r\nThe next moment was heard the terrible concussion--the horn of the\r\nmuchocho struck the \"buik plank,\" passing clear through it--the timber\r\nsplit from end to end--the \"achter kist\" was shivered to pieces, and the\r\nhuge vehicle was lifted clear from the ground, and hoisted several feet\r\nout of its place!  A simultaneous cry of alarm broke forth from the\r\noccupants of the wagon--which was continued as they saw the huge\r\nquadruped preparing to repeat the charge.\r\n\r\nAt this crisis the faithful buck-dogs performed an essential service,\r\nand saved, not only the wagons, but perhaps also the lives of their\r\nmasters.  As the great bull was heading once more towards the wagon,\r\nseveral of the dogs attacked him from behind; two of them launched\r\nthemselves upon his flanks, and one other springing upward, caught hold\r\nof his tail and hung on!\r\n\r\nNow the tail of the rhinoceros is one of his tenderest bits; and this\r\nnew and unexpected mode of assault quite disconcerted the old bull.\r\nInstead, therefore, of following up his charge upon the wagon, he turned\r\nround as fast as his unwieldy body would permit, blowing with agony and\r\nrage.  But the stanch hound still hung on, while the others kept biting\r\nat the bull's hind-legs; and vainly attempting to get at the dogs, the\r\nhuge beast danced round and round like a kitten after its own tail--if a\r\ncomparison may be allowed between two animals of such unequal\r\nmagnitudes.\r\n\r\nThis scene continued for some minutes, until at length the dogs were\r\nthrown off.  One of them was crushed beneath the heavy feet of the\r\nrhinoceros, while another was badly ripped by the horn of the female.\r\nBut the gallant brutes had performed their part well; and by means of\r\ntheir barking and biting, they had drawn the muchochos altogether away\r\nfrom the wagons, and into a different part of the meadow.\r\n\r\nIt was not likely they would return to the attack upon the wagons,\r\nunless they chanced to be driven that way by the dogs--for the\r\nrhinoceros, partly from his low power of sight, and partly from his\r\nforgetful nature, rarely returns to assault any object once he has\r\nquitted it.\r\n\r\nBut a new fear now sprang up in the minds of the young yagers--no longer\r\nfor themselves, but for their horses!\r\n\r\nThese animals, as already stated, along with the oxen, had been left\r\ngrazing upon the meadow, without any fastening.  When the muchochos\r\nfirst appeared, both oxen and horses had taken to flight.  The oxen had\r\ngone toward the lower end of the meadow; and, guided by a cunning old\r\nleader, had set off upon their back trail over the ridge by which they\r\nhad entered.  The horses, on the contrary, had remained prancing around\r\nthe wagons, until the muchochos came upon the spot; and, then dashing\r\noff together, had leaped the stream, and taken their stand trembling and\r\ncowering close by the cliffs on the opposite side.  Here they had\r\nremained during the early part of the fight between the dogs and\r\nmuchochos.\r\n\r\nBut in the course of this conflict both the dogs and their huge\r\nadversaries had worked up to the spot where the horses were, and once\r\nmore set the latter in motion.\r\n\r\nSeeing these, the rhinoceroses immediately started after them--perhaps\r\ndeeming them antagonists more worthy of their horns; and now for some\r\nminutes a terrible melee of charging muchochos and galloping steeds\r\nfilled the measure of the glen--the former blowing and snorting with\r\nrage, while the latter snorted with affright.\r\n\r\nFortunately, the small circumference within which this scene was\r\nenacted, enabled the hunters to use their pieces with effect; and\r\nwhenever either of the rhinoceroses came to a stand, if but for a\r\nmoment, the crack of a gun could be heard, and the thud of a bullet\r\nhitting against their thick hides.  It is a mistake to suppose that a\r\nleaden bullet will not penetrate the skin of a rhinoceros.  On the\r\ncontrary, the hide, though thick, is comparatively soft, and yields\r\neasily to either a spear or a ball--so that every shot took effect.  The\r\nhunters, _par excellence_, Hendrik and Groot Willem, fired most of the\r\nshots, aiming behind the fore-shoulder for the heart and lungs--for in\r\nthese parts the shot proves fatal.  A bullet into the brain would have a\r\nlike effect; but as the brain of the rhinoceros is exceedingly small in\r\nproportion to the size of the animal, it requires a sure aim to strike\r\nit; and the more certain way is to aim for the lungs.\r\n\r\nSo aimed Hendrik and Groot Willem; and what with the large leaden balls\r\nof the roer, and the small but better directed pellets of the rifle,\r\nboth the muchochos were at length made to bite the dust.  The calf was\r\nshot afterwards; for after the fall of its parents, the creature did not\r\nattempt to run away, but stood by the body of its mother, jerking its\r\nlittle tail about, and wondering what the trouble was all about.\r\n\r\nA very, ludicrous scene was now witnessed, that caused the young yagers\r\nto break into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.  Their laughter,\r\nhowever, did not come until after the incident was over which gave rise\r\nto it--for there was danger in the scene, and it was somewhat painful to\r\nwitness it.\r\n\r\nIt was as follows.  The rhinoceros, like the American bison, when shot\r\ndown by the hunter, rarely falls in the common way of other animals--\r\nupon its side--but usually sinks down upon his breast, and there remains\r\neven after death has taken place.\r\n\r\nThe two shot by Hendrik and Groot Willem had offered no exception to the\r\nrule.  Both lay upon their bellies at a little distance from the wagons,\r\ntheir broad massive backs turned upward.\r\n\r\nNow a practice equally common among Bushmen, whenever a rhinoceros has\r\nbeen killed, is to leap upon the animal's back, thrust their spears into\r\nits flesh to try the depth, and discover whether the game be fat, and\r\nconsequently valuable!\r\n\r\nIn the carrying out of this custom, no sooner had the great bull\r\nrhinoceros sunk down under the shots, than our Bushman, Swartboy, seeing\r\nthat all danger was over, leaped forth from the wagon, and running up to\r\nwhere the dead animal lay, sprang upon its back!  Shouting out a wild\r\ncry of triumph, he plunged his _assegai_ into the flesh of the muchocho\r\nto the depth of a foot or more.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same instant, the animal, which was not yet dead, rose to\r\nits feet again, and charged once more across the sward, with the Bushman\r\nupon its back!\r\n\r\nThe shout of triumph, which Swartboy had uttered, was suddenly\r\ninterrupted, and cries of a far different import now rang through the\r\nglen; while the rhinoceros, no doubt impelled to fresh energy of life by\r\nthe terrible pain he suffered from the Bushman's spear, charged round\r\nand round, as though he had quite recovered!\r\n\r\nSwartboy, on the other hand, dared not leap to the ground, lest he might\r\nbe impaled upon the dread horns, but held fast to the spear, which,\r\nstill buried in the animal's thick flesh, served him as a _point\r\nd'appui_!\r\n\r\nHow Swartboy would have been delivered, had the strength of the muchocho\r\nheld out, it is hard to say; but this gave way at length, and the huge\r\nquadruped once more sank to the earth, pitching the Bushman several\r\nyards over his head!\r\n\r\nSwartboy did not lie long where he had been flung; but, sprawling up\r\nagain, ran back at top speed to the wagons, where he was welcomed by\r\nyells of laughter!  The oxen were soon overtaken and brought back, the\r\ncalf of the muchocho regularly butchered, and that night the young\r\nyagers enjoyed a supper of \"rhinoceros veal.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY EIGHT.\r\n\r\nJAN AND THE KOORHAANS.\r\n\r\nThe next camp of the young yagers was fixed in a beautiful valley very\r\nsimilar to that in which they had seen the troop of lions, but of larger\r\nextent, and having its whole surface enamelled with bright flowers.\r\n\r\nThere were mountains all around, that seemed to shut in this fair\r\npicture and protect it from the hot dry winds of the desert.  A river\r\nwound through its midst like a silvery serpent; and here and there upon\r\nthe pools, where there was not much current, rested the wax-like leaves\r\nand flowers of the blue lily of South Africa, (_Nympha cerulea_), Upon\r\nthe plain grew trees and plants of various sorts peculiar to the botany\r\nof the country.  The eyes of the travellers rested upon many a fair\r\nform.  Upon the banks of the stream they saw the drooping fronds of the\r\nChaldean willow; and by the foot of the mountain the splendid _Acacia\r\neburnea_, with its umbrella-shaped head, and clusters of golden flowers\r\nfilling the air with their fragrance.  They saw the valuable wax-berry,\r\n(_Myrica cerifera_), yielding its clusters of white wax-coated fruit.\r\nThey saw the perfumed \"bead-bush,\" out of whose fragrant roots are\r\nshaped the beads held in such esteem among the savage belles of the\r\nland.  They saw the \"sugar-bush,\" (_Protea mellifera_), with its large\r\ncup-shaped pink and white flowers,--the most beautiful of the tribe of\r\n_Proteaceae_.  There, too, were scarlet geraniums, with marigolds, and\r\nstarry Cape jessamines, forming a garden in the wilderness pleasant to\r\nthe eye and fragrant to the sense.\r\n\r\nThe songs of numerous birds fell upon the ear, and their brilliant\r\nplumage could be seen as they fluttered among the branches.  The hum of\r\nbees, too, was heard; and thousands of these busy insects could be seen\r\nfluttering from flower to flower.\r\n\r\nIt was still early when the party arrived in this delightful spot; but\r\nso pleased were all of them with the scene around that they determined\r\nto halt before the usual hour and encamp there for the night.\r\n\r\nSo, choosing a pretty grove of willow-leafed \"olean-wood\" trees, that\r\nstood near the bank of the river, they outspanned under their shade.\r\n\r\nAs they were wearied by their exertions in getting the oxen over some\r\nrocky ridges, all lay down to rest under the cool shadow of the\r\nolean-woods; and several of the boys went to sleep, lulled by the sweet\r\nvoices of the birds, the humming of wild bees, and the rushing sound of\r\nthe water as it passed over some rapids below.\r\n\r\nKlaas and Jan, however, had not gone to sleep with the rest, for neither\r\nhad laid their shoulders to the wagon-wheels, and were, therefore, no\r\nmore tired than usual.  Besides, there was something nigh at hand that\r\nwould have kept both awake, even had they been a good deal fatigued, and\r\nthat was the appearance of a pair of very odd-looking birds out upon the\r\nplain, at no great distance from the wagons, and that every now and then\r\nraised their black top-knots above the grass and uttered a cry something\r\nlike the croak of a raven.\r\n\r\nThese birds were not so very large--about the size of common fowls--but\r\nthey were game-birds, having flesh of excellent flavour, and this\r\nrendered them interesting at the moment.  They were, also, of very\r\nelegant forms--something of the tall majestic shape of the bustards.  In\r\nfact, they were of a species that forms a sort of link between the\r\nbustards and grouse families; and are known in South Africa as\r\n\"koorhaans,\" and in India by the name of \"floricans.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was nothing of all this that rendered them so interesting to\r\nKlaas and Jan.  It was that the latter knew a very curious method of\r\ncapturing these very birds, and he was in a perfect fever to put it in\r\npractice right before the eyes of the rival bird-boy Klaas.  In fact,\r\never since the day that Klaas had so distinguished himself by knocking\r\nover the klipspringer, Jan had been burning for an opportunity to\r\nperform some feat of equal pretensions, but none had turned up.  Now\r\nthat these birds--old acquaintances of Jan's they were--had made their\r\nappearance, he saw a fair chance of gaining some renown.  He would show\r\nKlaas how to catch koorhaans in a proper manner--that he would.  So said\r\nJan.\r\n\r\nJan was not long in having his triumph, which he obtained in the\r\nfollowing manner.\r\n\r\nHe first pulled some long hair from the tail of his pony, which he\r\ntwisted into a large stout snare.  He next proceeded to Swartboy, and\r\nborrowed from the Bushman his whip, or rather the handle of the whip--\r\nfor Swartboy took off the lash to accommodate him.  It must be here\r\nremembered that Jan and Swartboy were great allies, and had been so for\r\na long time; and it was in reality Swartboy who had taught Jan the\r\ncurious mode he was about to practise upon the koorhaans.  It must also\r\nbe remembered that the handle of Swartboy's whip was an immense affair--\r\na bamboo cane, full eighteen feet in length, and more like a fishing-rod\r\nthan a whip-handle.\r\n\r\nWell, upon the end of this, where the lash had been tied, Jan adjusted\r\nhis snare; and then, mounting his pony, rode forth upon the plain.\r\n\r\nKlaas stood watching him; and upon Klaas's countenance there was a\r\npuzzled expression that Jan did not fail to notice, and that delighted\r\nhim exceedingly.\r\n\r\nKlaas knew nothing about the _modus operandi_--could not guess how the\r\nother was going to act--and his ignorance betrayed itself, though he did\r\nnot say a word.\r\n\r\nWas Jan going to ride up and snare the birds?  Surely they would not let\r\nhim come so near?  They appeared shy enough, and would not let him,\r\nKlaas, come within shot, for he had tried it but the minute before.  No:\r\nit could not be that way--the koorhaans wouldn't stand it, he knew.\r\n\r\nJan said nothing, but rode triumphantly forth, looking askance at Klaas\r\nas he passed out from camp.\r\n\r\nWhen within about one hundred yards of the koorhaans--Klaas expecting\r\nevery moment to see them run off as koorhaans usually do--Jan turned the\r\nhead of his pony, and commenced riding round in a circle.\r\n\r\nThis he continued until he had got quite round the first circumference;\r\nand then, drawing his pony slightly inward, he began a second circle,\r\nwhich he completed as the first; and then still heading more inward, he\r\nmade a third, and a fourth, and a fifth--of all which circles the\r\nbustards formed the centre.  Of course, it was not exactly a circle he\r\ntraced, but a spiral line constantly narrowing inward upon the game.\r\n\r\n\"Oho!\" muttered Klaas, \"I see what he's after now.  Oho!\"\r\n\r\nKlaas said nothing more; but remained watching with great interest,\r\nwhile Jan continued round and round like a blind horse in a brick-mill.\r\n\r\nBut Jan was not blind.  He was watching the movements of the koorhaans\r\nwith the sharp eye of a bird-catcher.\r\n\r\nAnd these birds were equally watching him--turning their heads now to\r\nthis side and now to that; but, like stupids as they were, neglecting to\r\nuse either their wings or legs to carry them out of the way of danger.\r\n\r\nThe result was that they permitted the pony, and Jan upon its back, to\r\napproach so near, that the boy was at length able to reach one of them\r\nwith the top of Swartboy's long whip-stick, and pass the noose over\r\nhead, topknot, and all.\r\n\r\nIn another moment the bird was fluttering at the end of the bamboo; and\r\nJan, without dismounting, pulled the creature in that way up to the\r\nwagons, and held it there with an air of triumph that left Klaas without\r\na word to say for the \"balance\" of that evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FORTY NINE.\r\n\r\nGROOT WILLEM AND THE PYTHON.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem awoke from his nap before the others.  It still wanted\r\nnearly two hours of sunset, and the hunter, observing a reddish object\r\nat a distance that looked like some animal, shouldered his roer and\r\nproceeded towards it.  He took with him one of the buck-dogs, a\r\nwell-trained and favourite hound, that usually accompanied him--even on\r\na stalking expedition.\r\n\r\nThe red object which he had seen was near the edge of the valley, and at\r\nthe bottom of a rocky precipice that bounded it upon that side.  There\r\nwere some trees growing along by the foot of the cliff, and the hunter\r\ncalculated on being able to get a shot at the animal, whatever it was,\r\nfrom behind the cover of these trees.  He continued on up the valley,\r\nand at length got near enough to tell what he was stalking at.\r\n\r\nIt was a small antelope, just about the size of the klipspringer, and\r\nwith little erect horns four inches in length.  In colour, however, it\r\nwas unlike the latter.  The upper parts of its body were a deep red, and\r\nunderneath white, while its snout and face were black.  The little\r\ncreature was higher at the croup than at the withers, and entirely\r\nwithout a tail, or with a tail only one inch long, that had more the\r\nappearance of a stump.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem, when he came nigh, recognised this antelope to be the\r\n_steenbok_, for he had met with it before, as it is common throughout\r\nthe colony, inhabiting high lying grounds where there are bushes.  It is\r\none of those classed under the genus _Tragulus_, of which three other\r\nspecies--all small antelopes--are met with in South Africa.  The other\r\nthree are the \"grysbok,\" (_Tragulus melanotis_), the \"vlackte steenbok,\"\r\n(_T. rufescens_), and the \"bleekbok;\" (_T. pediotragus_); though some\r\nnaturalists assert that the last are only _varieties_ of the steenbok,\r\n(_T. rupestris_).  Groot Willem did not spend a thought upon these\r\nmatters, he only thought of \"stalking\" the steenbok, and having its ribs\r\nfor a roast at supper.  He was able to approach it without any\r\ndifficulty, as it was close to the bushes, and appeared not to be very\r\nshy.\r\n\r\nThere was but the creature itself--a little buck; and rarely is more\r\nthan one, or at most two of these antelopes seen together--for the\r\nsteenbok, and all the others of the genus _Tragulus_, are monogamous and\r\nsolitary.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem was at length within range, and was about to level his roer\r\non the game, when the movements of the little animal caused him to hold\r\nhis hand.  Its actions were very odd, indeed.  It was not browsing--it\r\nwas not standing still--it was not running away from the ground,--and\r\nyet it was in constant motion!\r\n\r\nAs already stated, it was close in to the edge of the timber, where a\r\nnumber of small olean trees stood thinly over the ground.  In front of\r\nthese the little buck was dancing about in a very original manner.  Now\r\nit ran to the right,--anon to the left,--now zigzag,--now it started\r\nsuddenly backwards,--then ran forwards again,--all the while its eyes\r\nturning in a particular direction and shining brilliantly, as if the\r\nanimal itself was in a state of unusual excitement.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem looked to discover the cause of this odd manoeuvring on the\r\npart of the steenbok; something among the olean-wood trees seemed to\r\nattract the notice of the animal.  On this something the eyes of the\r\nhunter rested with wonderment; and for some moments he was unable to\r\nmake out what it was.  He could perceive a large glittering mass near\r\nthe bottom of one of the trees; but this mass at first sight appeared\r\nwithout any particular form, and lay perfectly motionless.\r\n\r\nAs Groot Willem continued to gaze upon it, however, it gradually assumed\r\na form, or rather his eyes gradually traced one, for the mass had not\r\nyet moved.\r\n\r\nA hideous form it was--though of smooth and regular proportions--it was\r\nthe form of a reptile--a serpent!\r\n\r\nA serpent of enormous size, for the mass of its body, gathered up in a\r\nsort of irregular coil, covered the ground over a space of several\r\nsquare feet, while the body itself seemed thicker than the thighs of a\r\nfull-grown man!  The head of the reptile rested upon the top of the\r\ncoiled body, and on running his eye along the mottled and glistening\r\noutlines, Groot Willem perceived that its tail was doubled around the\r\nstem of the olean-wood, and held it with firm grasp--for the serpent\r\nbelonged to a family whose tails are furnished with horny claw-like\r\nhooks, giving them a power of prehension in this member equal to that of\r\na hand.  This is the family of the _Boidae_, or \"boas,\" to which the one\r\nin question was generically related.  It was a _python_--the _Python\r\nNatalensis_.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem only knew it as the \"rock-snake,\" and that is its ordinary\r\ndesignation--given it on account of the fact of its being a dweller\r\namong rocks and stony places.  It might very properly be called\r\n\"rock-boa,\" which would distinguish it from its cousins of America, the\r\n_Anaconda_, or \"water-boa,\" and the true boa, which is a denizen of the\r\nforest, and which would therefore merit the title of \"tree-boa.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the difference of the dwelling-place of the boas and\r\npythons, their habits are very similar.  They lie in wait for their\r\nprey, capture it with their strong retractile teeth, and crushing it to\r\ndeath by constriction, swallow it whole--though often the animal\r\nswallowed is much larger than the diameter of their own bodies.  Their\r\nelastic muscles, however, enable them to effect their purpose, aided by\r\nthe slippery saliva which is copiously supplied from their glands.\r\n\r\nWhen Groot Willem first saw the huge python, its head was lying over the\r\ncoils of its body, and motionless.  Presently, the head was raised up\r\nwith the neck, and several feet of the body; and the parts, thus\r\nerected, moved gently from side to side with a sort of vibratory motion.\r\nThe jaws were widely extended, so that the sharp retractile teeth were\r\nplainly visible, and the forked tongue at intervals was shot forward,\r\nand gleamed in the sun.  The _eyes_ of the reptile sparkled like fire.\r\n\r\nIt was a fearful object to look upon!  And yet the steenbok did not\r\nappear to dread it.  On the contrary, it kept drawing nearer and nearer,\r\nexcited either by curiosity or _fascination_!\r\n\r\nThere are those who ridicule the idea of _fascination_ on the part of\r\nserpents.  But whether we are to believe in such a power or not, we\r\ncannot deny the fact.  Certain it is, that whether it be curiosity,\r\nfear, or fascination, both birds and animals are moved to approach not\r\nonly serpents, but crocodiles, until within reach of the jaws that are\r\nopened to devour them.  Certain is this, and vouched for by the\r\ntestimony of many a correct and reliable observer.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem witnessed the strange phenomenon.  When the buck had got\r\nwithin some six or eight feet of the python, the head of the latter\r\nsuddenly shot out; and before the antelope, which now appeared making an\r\neffort to escape, could spring out of the way, it was seized by the\r\nteeth of the reptile, and dragged towards the tree!\r\n\r\nA number of quick contortions followed, and when Groot Willem looked\r\nagain, the red body of the little antelope was almost hidden under the\r\nthick folds of the spotted python, that writhing around it was crushing\r\nit to death!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY.\r\n\r\nGROOT WILLEM'S GREAT STRUGGLE WITH THE SNAKE.\r\n\r\nNow it chanced that the sight of that great serpent was very gratifying\r\nto the eyes of Groot Willem--far more so than any antelope.  The reason\r\nwas, that a friend of his, a young doctor of Graaf Reinet, who was fond\r\nof the study of herpetology, had requested him to bring home the skins\r\nof such rare snakes as he might fall in with--but especially that of the\r\ngreat \"rock-snake,\" which is not found in the colony, not even so far\r\nsouth as the Orange River.\r\n\r\nHere was a chance for the skin, which, up to this time, Groot Willem had\r\nsearched for in vain.\r\n\r\nHe had another reason for being gratified; and that was the splendid\r\ntrophy it would be, provided he succeeded in obtaining it.  To kill a\r\nsnake twenty feet long, and half as thick as a man--for the python\r\nappeared to be both--would be no small triumph!  Where would Hendrik be\r\nthen?\r\n\r\nAll at once the steenbok was forgotten, and the snake became the object\r\nof the hunter's skill.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem had no skill about him.  He knew of no mode to attack this\r\nnew sort of enemy, except dealing with it as he would with a quadruped--\r\nthat is, sending a bullet into it; and this he did the moment after.\r\n\r\nHis roer was levelled; and, glancing through his ivory sights, he fired\r\nthe large ball through the thickest part of the reptile's body.\r\n\r\nThe latter felt the shot; and, suddenly unfolding itself, dropped the\r\nsteenbok--now nothing more than a mangled carcase, with scarce a whole\r\nbone in it.  The rapidity with which the snake glided off showed that\r\nthe wound had done it but little harm.\r\n\r\nThe hunter thought of reloading again, when he perceived the serpent\r\nfast making to the rocks that in large masses lay piled up near the\r\nbottom of the cliff.  Among these was its retreat; and if it once\r\nreached them, Groot Willem saw that he should never set eyes on it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nWithout staying to reload his gun, then, he ran in among the trees, and\r\nfollowed the direction taken by the serpent.\r\n\r\nAlthough these snakes glide along with considerable rapidity, they can\r\nby no means go so fast as a man; and in less than a dozen seconds Groot\r\nWillem had overtaken the python, and for that matter might have trodden\r\nupon its tail.\r\n\r\nThere he was close beside the fearful-looking monster, but without the\r\nknowledge how to attack it.  He began by striking at its body with the\r\nbutt of his gun; but although his blows were delivered fairly enough,\r\nthe metal-shod heel of his roer only glanced from the slippery skin of\r\nthe snake, without harming it in the least, or even retarding its\r\nprogress towards the cliff.  It made no attempt to retaliate, but only\r\nseemed bent on escaping to its lair.\r\n\r\nIt was almost successful; for although Groot Willem pounded away with\r\nall his might, it reached the rocks in spite of him, and had buried half\r\nof its long body within a crevice--no doubt the entrance to its den--\r\nbefore the hunter thought of changing his tactics.\r\n\r\nIt was now a critical moment with Groot Willem.  Another instant, and\r\nthe remaining half of the snake would slip out of sight, and then\r\ngood-bye to it.  What would he say to his medical friend?  What to\r\nHendrik and the yagers?\r\n\r\nThese thoughts inspired him with renewed energy; a new determination to\r\nsucceed came over him.  The snake was not a poisonous one; and,\r\ntherefore, the encounter could not be very dangerous.  It might bite\r\nhim, but he had battled with many a biting creature before now, and\r\nconquered them, too.  He would try his strength upon the snake.\r\n\r\nHe was not two seconds of time on coming to this determination; and, as\r\nsoon as he had done so, he tossed his roer aside, and stooping down,\r\nseized the tail of the snake in both hands, and commenced hauling upon\r\nit!\r\n\r\nAt the first \"pluck\" he drew the reptile several feet outward; but, to\r\nhis surprise, it then held fast; and, notwithstanding his great\r\nstrength, he was unable to draw it a foot farther.  The creature had, no\r\ndoubt, got the fore-part of its body around an angle in the rocks; and,\r\naided by its scaly skin, was enabled to hold fast.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem pulled with all his might.  A sailor in a storm could not\r\nhave hauled harder upon the main brace; but all to no purpose, as not\r\nanother foot of that part of the python that was still visible could be\r\nlengthened.  About the half of it was still outside, but the other ten\r\nfeet were buried within the dark recesses of the rocks.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes Groot Willem continued to exert his strength,\r\ndragging the long cylinder until he could hear its vertebrae crack, but\r\nwithout gaining an inch!  On the contrary, he had already lost several\r\ninches.  Every time that he relaxed his hold, the python was enabled to\r\nmove forward a bit, and this ground it never gave up again.  If Groot\r\nWillem allowed it an inch, it was sure to struggle for an ell!  It had\r\nall the advantage on its side, as it pulled _with the grain_, while its\r\nantagonist was exerting his strength _against_ it.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem felt confident he could hold the python in this position,\r\nas long as he could stand upon his feet; but what good would there be in\r\nso doing?  He could not kill it in that way.  If he were to \"let go\" for\r\nbut an instant, he very well knew that the next instant would show him\r\nthe last inch of the tail disappearing into the crevice!  No, he could\r\nnot let go, and he was resolved not to let go, until he should at least\r\ntry the patience of his opponent.  Maybe it would tire of being thus\r\nheld upon the \"stretch,\" and would let him pull it out again.\r\n\r\nIf there had only been some one with him to administer a few smart blows\r\nupon the creature's body it would have been all well; but the camp was\r\nat a very long distance off, and behind the trees.  His companions could\r\nneither see nor hear him.\r\n\r\nAfter standing on the strain a considerable time, a bright idea entered\r\nthe brain of the hunter.  There grew a small tree beside him--in fact,\r\nhe was close by its trunk.  The thought occurred that, if by any means\r\nhe could fasten the tail to the tree, he could then go to work with a\r\nsapling, and beat the snake to death at his pleasure.\r\n\r\nHe was a ready fellow, Groot Willem, and a few moments sufficed him to\r\nmature his plans.  He chanced to have a strong \"cord\" in the ample\r\npocket of his jacket, which would serve to effect the very purpose, if\r\nhe could only manage somehow to make it fast to the tail.  This he\r\nproceeded to do at once.\r\n\r\nStraddling the snake, so as to hold it partly between his knees, he was\r\nenabled to loop the cord tightly around it, and the thing was done.  In\r\na minute more, the other end of the cord was tightly knotted around the\r\ntrunk of the tree!\r\n\r\nGroot Willem now broke off a sapling, determined either to beat the\r\nhinder half of the python to a jelly, or make it surrender and show its\r\nhead!\r\n\r\nHe had not delivered the third blow, when it adopted the latter\r\nalternative; and the whole of its body now glided rapidly back out of\r\nthe crevice--so rapidly that Groot Willem was not able to avoid the\r\nonset of the enraged reptile, and the next moment he was gathered within\r\nits coils!\r\n\r\nSo quick was the act, that he scarce knew how it had been accomplished.\r\nHe saw the head, with its open jaws extended, dart towards him; he\r\nsprang to one side, but felt the cold scaly body against his limbs as if\r\npulling him towards the tree; and the moment after, he was swept close\r\nup to the trunk, and pressed tightly against it!\r\n\r\nHe had just time to perceive that the folds of the serpent were around\r\nhis limbs, and also around the trunk of the tree,--just time to feel\r\nthat they were gradually tightening upon him--when the head, with its\r\nextended jaws and terrible teeth, came right opposite his face, and the\r\neyes of the monster gleamed right into his!\r\n\r\nA horrid spectacle it was--a horrid situation he was in; but Groot\r\nWillem was not the boy to lose either courage or presence of mind; and,\r\nfinding his arms still free, he clutched forward and seized the reptile\r\nby the throat.  To hold its head was just as much as he was able with\r\nboth hands and with all his strength; but he held with the grasp of\r\ndespair.  Fortunate it was for him that the tail of the python was\r\nsecured by the rheim, and it was thus held fast at both ends!  Had it\r\nbeen otherwise--had either head or tail been free, so that it could have\r\nused its power of constriction--in a few seconds more, Groot Willem\r\nwould have been crushed as he had seen the little antelope.  But now\r\nthat both tail and head were fixed--the one by the cord and the other in\r\nthe strong grasp of the hunter--the serpent was unable to exert its\r\nterrible power; and its folds remained loose around the limbs of its\r\nintended victim!\r\n\r\nIt writhed its neck, and wriggled its body, and changed the spiral rings\r\nfrom one part to another,--but all in vain.  It could do him no harm!\r\n\r\nHow long this terrible struggle might have lasted would have depended\r\nupon how long the strength of the two could have held out.  Groot Willem\r\ncould not free himself from the folds of his antagonist, as _both_ his\r\nlegs were bound to the tree; and had he dropped the head of the python\r\nfor a moment, he knew it would crush him to death.  The snake, on the\r\nother hand, could not free itself, as it was held fast at both\r\nextremities.  What was to be the result?  Which would be the conqueror?\r\n\r\nThe serpent must have conquered in the end; though it might not have\r\nbeen able to free itself, as its tail was fastened to the tree.  But\r\nGroot Willem was not able to strangle it, with all the compression he\r\nwas exercising upon its throat, and his strength would have yielded in\r\ntime.  Most certainly would he have fallen a victim, but for a plan that\r\nhe at length adopted to set himself free.\r\n\r\nDuring all the continuance of the fight between him and the serpent, he\r\nhad not attempted to use his knife.  He had not thought of such a weapon\r\nagainst such an enemy.  Not dreaming that he would be brought into close\r\nquarters, he had almost forgotten that he carried a knife.  By good\r\nfortune he had one, and it was in his belt.  Even though one or two\r\nfolds of the snake were around his breast, he could see the handle of\r\nthe knife above them; and making a sudden grasp, he laid hold of it, and\r\ndrew it forth.\r\n\r\nThe blade chanced to be almost as keen as a razor; and although the\r\nserpent now succeeded in twisting its head partially free, before it\r\ncould tighten its folds, the sharp edge of the knife had half severed\r\nits body in twain!\r\n\r\nA second gash was made in another part, and then a third and still\r\ndeeper one; and the resolute hunter had the gratification to see the\r\nspiral rounds that threatened his destruction fall off and drop heavily\r\nto his feet!\r\n\r\nIn a short while the python lay dead upon the ground; and Groot Willem,\r\nalthough he felt that he had secured a great triumph, left the spot with\r\nsome regret that he had _spoiled the skin_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY ONE.\r\n\r\nTHE HONEY-GUIDE AND HONEY-EATER.\r\n\r\nGroot Willem's adventure was acknowledged by all to be the most\r\nwonderful that had occurred to any of them--even surpassing that of\r\nHendrik with the rhinoceros--and for a good while it continued to be the\r\nsubject of camp conversation.\r\n\r\nDuring the expedition, every one of the party had either performed some\r\ngrand feat or fallen in with a remarkable adventure, except Arend.  It\r\nwas not that Arend had less courage or less capacity than the rest; but,\r\npartly, because he felt no inclination to put himself in the way of\r\nhunting adventures, and partly that the chances had not favoured him.\r\nOne adventure he had fallen in with--literally _fallen in_ with.  He had\r\ntumbled, horse and all, into a pit-trap set by some savages for\r\ncapturing the rhinoceros!  Fortunately, the sharp spike, usually placed\r\nat the bottom of these holes, had been removed--else either Arend or the\r\nhorse would have fared worse than they did.  Many a laugh had the six\r\nyoung yagers at Arend's solitary adventure.  I say six, for Arend always\r\ngood-naturedly joined in it himself.  Arend was not the man for\r\nadventures in the great wilderness.  Had it been in the great city\r\ninstead, no doubt his fine face and handsome figure would have helped\r\nhim to many a one in the flirtation line--had he been inclined that way.\r\nBut neither did Arend care about that.  He had but one ruling thought--\r\nso Groot Willem alleged--and that was to get home to the Graaf Reinet;\r\nand Groot usually added the reason, by giving a wink, and a word or two\r\nabout \"cherry cheeks and blue eyes.\"\r\n\r\nArend, however, was not destined to see home without one other\r\nadventure, in which all the rest had share, and which proved not only\r\nthe last they met with during that expedition, but was near being the\r\nlast of their lives!\r\n\r\nThey had changed their camp from the flowery plain to another equally\r\nflowery, though the plants that blossomed around were of a very\r\ndifferent character.  There were geraniums and marigolds in this plain,\r\nas there had been in the other; but here euphorbias of different species\r\npredominated, with cacti and other succulent plants.\r\n\r\nAbove their heads towered the tree Euphorbia, (_E. grandidens_), while\r\nat their feet the melon-shaped variety peeped forth from the ground.\r\nThere too, were several poisonous species; among others the _Euphorbia\r\nantiquorum_ growing side by side with the deadly belladonna lily,\r\n(_Amaryllis belladonna_).  The young yagers seemed to have arrived upon\r\na spot of earth that was almost wholly occupied with poison-yielding\r\nplants!\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was a lovely scene.  The flowers looked as fresh and as fair\r\nas elsewhere, and their fragrance scented the air around.  Birds\r\ndisported themselves among the branches of the trees; and bees hummed\r\nand whirred over the blossoms, imparting cheerfulness to the wild scene,\r\nand calling up ideas of home that were, at the moment, agreeable to the\r\ntired travellers.  They had just formed camp, and were sitting quietly\r\ndown, when their attention was drawn to a bird that had perched itself\r\nupon a low bush at no great distance from the wagons.  It was not the\r\nbeauty of this bird that attracted them, for its plumage was not\r\nbeautiful, being of an ashy-brown colour upon the back, and grey below.\r\nIt was not its size, which was that of an ordinary finch; nor its song,\r\nwhich was no better than a monotonous chatter of the syllables\r\n\"Kwi-kwi-kwi-kit.\"  It was none of these things that caused the young\r\nyagers to give their attention to the bird, but its peculiar character--\r\nalready well known to all of them.  The little bird which sat upon the\r\nbush, starting from branch to branch, jerking about its tail, and\r\nuttering the \"kwi-kwi-kit,\" was no other than the celebrated\r\n\"honey-guide.\"\r\n\r\nThey all knew it; for they had met with it several times during the\r\nexpedition, and Hans had told them its history.  They all knew of its\r\ncurious habits; how it will guide a man to the nest of the wild bee, by\r\nfluttering before him from bush to bush and rock to rock until it\r\nreaches the spot; how it will wait until the hive has been robbed of its\r\nhoney-treasure; and then alight by the despoiled nest to feed upon the\r\nlarvae of the bees, or the fragments of honeycomb that may have been\r\nleft!  They all knew this of the honey-guide, because they had followed\r\none before now, and proved the truth of this wonderful _instinct_, which\r\nhas been doubted by many travellers as well as naturalists.\r\n\r\nThose points of its natural history they did not know of Hans had told\r\nthem of long before.  He had told them how the bird had been classed\r\namong the cuckoos, under the title _Cuculus indicator_--because it\r\nshares with the true cuckoos the singular habit of depositing its eggs\r\nin the nest of another bird; how other naturalists have formed a genus\r\nfor itself--the genus _indicator_, of which several species are known;\r\nhow the bird feeds mostly upon honey and the larvae of bees; and how\r\nnature has given it a protection against the stings of the old ones in\r\nthe thickness of its skin: but Swartboy declared, in relation to this\r\nmatter, that the thick skin did not always save it; as he had often\r\nfound the honey-guide lying dead by the nests of the bees, and evidently\r\nkilled by their stings!\r\n\r\nAll these points in the natural history of the honey-bird were known to\r\nthe young yagers; therefore the little chatterer, that had lit upon the\r\nadjacent bush, was no stranger to them.\r\n\r\nAnd they were all right glad to see it, for a certain reason--because\r\nthey wanted some honey, and particularly at that very time, as their\r\nsugar had run out, and they had nothing to sweeten their coffee with--a\r\nprivation to several of the party.\r\n\r\nAll leaped to their feet, therefore, with the determination to follow\r\nthe \"honey-guide,\" go where it would.\r\n\r\nThey laid hold of their arms; and, what was still stranger, saddled and\r\nmounted their horses, intending to follow the guide on horseback!\r\n\r\nYou will wonder at this.  But when you hear that the honey-guide often\r\ntakes the hunter six or seven miles through the woods--and that not\r\nunfrequently it guides him to the lair of a lion, or the haunt of a\r\nblack rhinoceros, instead of to the nest of a bee--you will understand\r\nwhy the young yagers took these precautions.\r\n\r\nJust as they were about starting out, a very odd-looking animal \"hove in\r\nsight.\"  It had something of the appearance of a badger--being low set\r\non its legs, plantigrade in its hind-feet, and with a snout and tail\r\nvery like those of that animal.  Its colour, too, and pelage, was not\r\nunlike that of the common badger--a sombre grey above and black below,\r\ndivided by a light stripe running down each side from the ears to the\r\nroot of the tail.  In size it was superior to the badger, and nearly\r\nequalling in this respect the American glutton, or \"wolverene,\" which it\r\nalso resembled.  It had the general appearance of all the animals of the\r\nbadger family--which, though few in genera and species, is represented\r\nby one or two in nearly every part of the globe.  The animal which our\r\nyagers saw, or its species, to speak more properly, was the\r\nrepresentative of that family in South Africa.  It was the \"ratel,\" or\r\n\"honey-eater,\" (_Mellivora capensis_).\r\n\r\nNow this quadruped was almost as well known to our party as the bird.\r\nThey knew that its habits were equally singular; that, like the\r\n\"indicator,\" it possessed a \"sweet tooth;\" and spent most, if not all of\r\nits time, in searching for the nests of bees and robbing them of their\r\nhoney--provided the said nests were in the ground, where it could tear\r\nthem up with its strong terrier-claws.  On the other hand, when the nest\r\nchanced to be in a tree, they knew the ratel could not reach it--this\r\nanimal not being a tree-climber.  On such occasions he usually leaves\r\nthe mark of his claws upon the lower bark, and this often guides the\r\nHottentot hunter to a nest stored with honey.  All these things the\r\nyagers had learnt from Swartboy and Congo; and from Hans a few other\r\nfacts--such as that the ratel is found throughout all Africa--that it is\r\nformed by naturalists into a genus of itself, like so many other\r\nanomalous creatures of that continent--that its skin is so thick the\r\nbees cannot pierce it with their stings, so that it devours their\r\nhoneycombs without fear of the buzzing insects--that on account of its\r\ndisagreeable odour it is sometimes known as the \"stinking badger.\"\r\n\r\nOther facts with which all were acquainted were, that the ratel is\r\naccustomed to follow the \"honey-guide;\" and that the bird frequently\r\nconducts the quadruped to the hive--very much in the same way as it acts\r\nwhen followed by a man.  _It is said_, however, on such occasions to fly\r\nlower, and to take shorter flights, lest the badger might lose sight of\r\nit!  So says Monsieur Verreaux!\r\n\r\nNow it was plain to the party that the ratel was at that moment in\r\npursuit of his profession, and in full pursuit of the indicator.  The\r\ninterference, however, of the mounted yagers caused him to turn round,\r\nand make off in another direction; and the impatient \"guide,\" having now\r\ngone ahead, was followed by a-much larger \"tail.\"\r\n\r\nOn went the little creature from tree to tree, uttering its\r\n\"kwi-kwi-kit,\" and evidently pleased at its new \"following.\"  On rode\r\nthe young yagers directly in the wake of their guide.\r\n\r\nFortunately they had not far to go.  The more frequently repeated\r\ntwittering of the bird, and the increased excitement which the little\r\ncreature exhibited, told the hunters they were near the nest of the\r\nbees; and in a few minutes after the bird perched upon a particular\r\ntree, and would fly no farther.  In this tree was the hive!\r\n\r\nThey could have told that from the fact that near its roots the bark was\r\nscratched and torn off by the claws of some animal--the claws of a\r\nratel, of course--and the amount of scratching showed, that more than\r\none of these honey-eating quadrupeds had been guided to this place of\r\n_sweets_ to meet with bitter disappointment!\r\n\r\nA pair of axes, with Swartboy and Congo to handle them, were now brought\r\nfrom the camp; the tree soon fell under their strokes: the bees were\r\nsmoked out; and the honeycombs--a fragment or two being left as a reward\r\nfor the services of the \"guide\"--were carried off to camp.\r\n\r\nThe store proved one of the largest? and the six yagers, as well as\r\ntheir dark-skinned attendants, that evening enjoyed a \"surfeit of\r\nsweets.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER FIFTY TWO.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nAnd a surfeit of sweets it proved.  Better for them had they never found\r\nthat bees' nest, or had left its contents to the bird and the badger.\r\n\r\nIn less than an hour from the time they had eaten the honey, the whole\r\ncamp was in a state of the greatest alarm.  Every one of the party was\r\nsuffering from a parched throat, a burning breast, and a loathing at the\r\nstomach.  The bees had been busy among the blossoms of the belladonna\r\nand the flowers of the euphorbia, and _their honey was poison_!\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to depict the consternation that was felt in the\r\ncamp.  They had all eaten of the poisoned honey--yagers, drivers, and\r\nall.  They had all eaten plentifully of it--for there chanced to be\r\nplenty--and the absence of a vegetable diet for some days past had\r\nsharpened their appetite for the honey.  Not one of them that was not\r\nill--too ill either to give help or consolation to the others.\r\n\r\nEvery one believed he was _poisoned_, and acted accordingly.  Hans of\r\nall preserved most presence of mind.  He used all his skill in\r\nadministering such antidotes as he could think of.  Purgatives and\r\nemetics--such as they had in their chests--were freely administered; and\r\nno doubt to these might be attributed the saving of their lives.\r\n\r\nTheir lives _were_ saved--the crisis passed without proving fatal to any\r\nof them--but for days their illness continued; for days the young yagers\r\nmight be seen wandering about the camp, or sitting listlessly around the\r\ncamp-fire reduced to the thinness of skeletons, and looking like the\r\nghosts of their former selves!\r\n\r\nSo great a shock had their health received, that they thought no more of\r\ncontinuing their expedition; they only waited for strength enough to\r\nenable them to set out on their return homeward.  Arend's desire would\r\nnow be fulfilled--he would soon look upon the lovely Truey, and listen\r\nto the cheerful music of her voice.  Hendrik--ardent hunter though he\r\nwas--was equally desirous to get back, and lay his spoils at the feet of\r\nthe blushing Wilhelmina.  Klaas and Jan longed for puddings and\r\nsugar-plums; and Hans, who had now made a very extensive collection of\r\nthe flora of the country, was also willing to return.\r\n\r\nOnly one--the great tireless loose-boned giant, Groot Willem--would\r\nstill have persevered, and climbed over the mountains that separated\r\nthem from the land of elephants, buffaloes, and camelopards.  Groot\r\nWillem would still have gone on, had it been possible for the others to\r\nhave accompanied him.  But it was not possible, and the big hunter-boy\r\nwas obliged to turn back with his companions.  It was with a heavy heart\r\nthat he did so--for he had for many years entertained an ardent longing\r\nto try his roer upon the huge thick-skinned quadrupeds that now roamed\r\nfar beyond the frontier of the settlements.  Perhaps he faced homeward\r\nwith the less regret, that he had hopes of making, at no distant day,\r\n_another expedition to the haunts of the mighty elephant upon the banks\r\nof the lovely Limpopo_.\r\n\r\nThis hope consoled Groot Willem, as he mounted his huge horse, and rode\r\nafter the wagons that were already inspanned and treking down the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nDay by day, as the young yagers travelled homewards, they grew stronger\r\nand stronger; and when they had reached the Graaf Reinet, the effects of\r\nthe poisoned honey had entirely disappeared--so that all six arrived\r\nhome \"safe and sound.\"\r\n\r\nI need not tell you that a warm welcome awaited them in the paternal\r\nmansions of Van Wyk and Von Bloom.  I need not tell how lovely looked\r\nTruey, and how sweetly blushed Wilhelmina; nor need I describe the\r\nsplendid \"vrolykeid\" that was given--at which all the rich boors of the\r\ncountry were present to celebrate the return of:\r\n\r\n\"The Young Yagers.\"\r\n\r\nThe End.",
