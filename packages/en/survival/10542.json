As told by John\r\nWinterstraw, Gent., to his son James Winterstraw, in the year 1757, and\r\nby him committed very properly and legibly to manuscript.\r\n\r\nBy William Hope Hodgson\r\n\r\n1907\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Madre Mia_\r\n\r\nPeople may say thou art no longer young\r\n  And yet, to me, thy youth was yesterday,\r\n    A yesterday that seems\r\n    Still mingled with my dreams.\r\nAh! how the years have o'er thee flung\r\n  Their soft mantilla, grey.\r\n\r\nAnd e'en to them thou art not over old;\r\n  How could'st thou be! Thy hair\r\n    Hast scarcely lost its deep old glorious dark:\r\n    Thy face is scarcely lined. No mark\r\nDestroys its calm serenity. Like gold\r\n  Of evening light, when winds scarce stir,\r\n  The soul-light of thy face is pure as prayer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe Land of Lonesomeness\r\n\r\n\r\nNow we had been five days in the boats, and in all this time made no\r\ndiscovering of land. Then upon the morning of the sixth day came there a\r\ncry from the bo'sun, who had the command of the lifeboat, that there was\r\nsomething which might be land afar upon our larboard bow; but it was very\r\nlow lying, and none could tell whether it was land or but a morning\r\ncloud. Yet, because there was the beginning of hope within our hearts, we\r\npulled wearily towards it, and thus, in about an hour, discovered it to\r\nbe indeed the coast of some flat country.\r\n\r\nThen, it might be a little after the hour of midday, we had come so close\r\nto it that we could distinguish with ease what manner of land lay beyond\r\nthe shore, and thus we found it to be of an abominable flatness, desolate\r\nbeyond all that I could have imagined. Here and there it appeared to be\r\ncovered with clumps of queer vegetation; though whether they were small\r\ntrees or great bushes, I had no means of telling; but this I know, that\r\nthey were like unto nothing which ever I had set eyes upon before.\r\n\r\nSo much as this I gathered as we pulled slowly along the coast, seeking\r\nan opening whereby we could pass inward to the land; but a weary time\r\npassed or ere we came upon that which we sought. Yet, in the end, we\r\nfound it--a slimy-banked creek, which proved to be the estuary of a great\r\nriver, though we spoke of it always as a creek. Into this we entered, and\r\nproceeded at no great pace upwards along its winding course; and as we\r\nmade forward, we scanned the low banks upon each side, perchance there\r\nmight be some spot where we could make to land; but we found none--the\r\nbanks being composed of a vile mud which gave us no encouragement to\r\nventure rashly upon them.\r\n\r\nNow, having taken the boat something over a mile up the great creek, we\r\ncame upon the first of that vegetation which I had chanced to notice from\r\nthe sea, and here, being within some score yards of it, we were the\r\nbetter able to study it. Thus I found that it was indeed composed largely\r\nof a sort of tree, very low and stunted, and having what might be\r\ndescribed as an unwholesome look about it. The branches of this tree, I\r\nperceived to be the cause of my inability to recognize it from a bush,\r\nuntil I had come close upon it; for they grew thin and smooth through all\r\ntheir length, and hung towards the earth; being weighted thereto by a\r\nsingle, large cabbage-like plant which seemed to sprout from the extreme\r\ntip of each.\r\n\r\nPresently, having passed beyond this clump of the vegetation, and the\r\nbanks of the river remaining very low, I stood me upon a thwart, by which\r\nmeans I was enabled to scan the surrounding country. This I discovered,\r\nso far as my sight could penetrate, to be pierced in all directions with\r\ninnumerable creeks and pools, some of these latter being very great of\r\nextent; and, as I have before made mention, everywhere the country was\r\nlow set--as it might be a great plain of mud; so that it gave me a sense\r\nof dreariness to look out upon it. It may be, all unconsciously, that my\r\nspirit was put in awe by the extreme silence of all the country around;\r\nfor in all that waste I could see no living thing, neither bird nor\r\nvegetable, save it be the stunted trees, which, indeed, grew in clumps\r\nhere and there over all the land, so much as I could see.\r\n\r\nThis silence, when I grew fully aware of it was the more uncanny; for my\r\nmemory told me that never before had I come upon a country which\r\ncontained so much quietness. Nothing moved across my vision--not even a\r\nlone bird soared up against the dull sky; and, for my hearing, not so\r\nmuch as the cry of a sea-bird came to me--no! nor the croak of a frog,\r\nnor the plash of a fish. It was as though we had come upon the Country of\r\nSilence, which some have called the Land of Lonesomeness.\r\n\r\nNow three hours had passed whilst we ceased not to labor at the oars, and\r\nwe could no more see the sea; yet no place fit for our feet had come to\r\nview, for everywhere the mud, grey and black, surrounded us--encompassing\r\nus veritably by a slimy wilderness. And so we were fain to pull on, in\r\nthe hope that we might come ultimately to firm ground.\r\n\r\nThen, a little before sundown, we halted upon our oars, and made a scant\r\nmeal from a portion of our remaining provisions; and as we ate, I could\r\nsee the sun sinking away over the wastes, and I had some slight diversion\r\nin watching the grotesque shadows which it cast from the trees into the\r\nwater upon our larboard side; for we had come to a pause opposite a clump\r\nof the vegetation. It was at this time, as I remember, that it was borne\r\nin upon me afresh how very silent was the land; and that this was not due\r\nto my imagination, I remarked that the men both in our own and in the\r\nbo'sun's boat, seemed uneasy because of it; for none spoke save in\r\nundertones, as though they had fear of breaking it.\r\n\r\nAnd it was at this time, when I was awed by so much solitude, that there\r\ncame the first telling of life in all that wilderness. I heard it first\r\nin the far distance, away inland--a curious, low, sobbing note it was,\r\nand the rise and the fall of it was like to the sobbing of a lonesome\r\nwind through a great forest. Yet was there no wind. Then, in a moment, it\r\nhad died, and the silence of the land was awesome by reason of the\r\ncontrast. And I looked about me at the men, both in the boat in which I\r\nwas and that which the bo'sun commanded; and not one was there but held\r\nhimself in a posture of listening. In this wise a minute of quietness\r\npassed, and then one of the men gave out a laugh, born of the nervousness\r\nwhich had taken him.\r\n\r\nThe bo'sun muttered to him to hush, and, in the same moment, there came\r\nagain the plaint of that wild sobbing. And abruptly it sounded away on\r\nour right, and immediately was caught up, as it were, and echoed back\r\nfrom some place beyond us afar up the creek. At that, I got me upon a\r\nthwart, intending to take another look over the country about us; but\r\nthe banks of the creek had become higher; moreover the vegetation acted\r\nas a screen, even had my stature and elevation enabled me to overlook\r\nthe banks.\r\n\r\nAnd so, after a little while, the crying died away, and there was another\r\nsilence. Then, as we sat each one harking for what might next befall,\r\nGeorge, the youngest 'prentice boy, who had his seat beside me, plucked\r\nme by the sleeve, inquiring in a troubled voice whether I had any\r\nknowledge of that which the crying might portend; but I shook my head,\r\ntelling him that I had no knowing beyond his own; though, for his\r\ncomfort, I said that it might be the wind. Yet, at that, he shook his\r\nhead; for indeed, it was plain that it could not be by such agency, for\r\nthere was a stark calm.\r\n\r\nNow, I had scarce made an end of my remark, when again the sad crying\r\nwas upon us. It appeared to come from far up the creek, and from far down\r\nthe creek, and from inland and the land between us and the sea. It filled\r\nthe evening air with its doleful wailing, and I remarked that there was\r\nin it a curious sobbing, most human in its despairful crying. And so\r\nawesome was the thing that no man of us spoke; for it seemed that we\r\nharked to the weeping of lost souls. And then, as we waited fearfully,\r\nthe sun sank below the edge of the world, and the dusk was upon us.\r\n\r\nAnd now a more extraordinary thing happened; for, as the night fell with\r\nswift gloom, the strange wailing and crying was hushed, and another sound\r\nstole out upon the land--a far, sullen growling. At the first, like the\r\ncrying, it came from far inland; but was caught up speedily on all sides\r\nof us, and presently the dark was full of it. And it increased in volume,\r\nand strange trumpetings fled across it. Then, though with slowness, it\r\nfell away to a low, continuous growling, and in it there was that which I\r\ncan only describe as an insistent, hungry snarl. Aye! no other word of\r\nwhich I have knowledge so well describes it as that--a note of _hunger_,\r\nmost awesome to the ear. And this, more than all the rest of those\r\nincredible voicings, brought terror into my heart.\r\n\r\nNow as I sat listening, George gripped me suddenly by the arm, declaring\r\nin a shrill whisper that something had come among the clump of trees upon\r\nthe left-hand bank. Of the truth of this, I had immediately a proof; for\r\nI caught the sound of a continuous rustling among them, and then a nearer\r\nnote of growling, as though a wild beast purred at my elbow. Immediately\r\nupon this, I caught the bo'sun's voice, calling in a low tone to Josh,\r\nthe eldest 'prentice, who had the charge of our boat, to come alongside\r\nof him; for he would have the boats together. Then got we out the oars\r\nand laid the boats together in the midst of the creek; and so we watched\r\nthrough the night, being full of fear, so that we kept our speech low;\r\nthat is, so low as would carry our thoughts one to the other through the\r\nnoise of the growling.\r\n\r\nAnd so the hours passed, and naught happened more than I have told, save\r\nthat once, a little after midnight, the trees opposite to us seemed to be\r\nstirred again, as though some creature, or creatures, lurked among them;\r\nand there came, a little after that, a sound as of something stirring the\r\nwater up against the bank; but it ceased in a while and the silence fell\r\nonce more.\r\n\r\nThus, after a weariful time, away Eastwards the sky began to tell of the\r\ncoming of the day; and, as the light grew and strengthened, so did that\r\ninsatiable growling pass hence with the dark and the shadows. And so at\r\nlast came the day, and once more there was borne to us the sad wailing\r\nthat had preceded the night. For a certain while it lasted, rising and\r\nfalling most mournfully over the vastness of the surrounding wastes,\r\nuntil the sun was risen some degrees above the horizon; after which it\r\nbegan to fail, dying away in lingering echoes, most solemn to our ears.\r\nAnd so it passed, and there came again the silence that had been with us\r\nin all the daylight hours.\r\n\r\nNow, it being day, the bo'sun bade us make such sparse breakfast as our\r\nprovender allowed; after which, having first scanned the banks to\r\ndiscern if any fearful thing were visible, we took again to our oars,\r\nand proceeded on our upward journey; for we hoped presently to come upon\r\na country where life had not become extinct, and where we could put foot\r\nto honest earth. Yet, as I have made mention earlier, the vegetation,\r\nwhere it grew, did flourish most luxuriantly; so that I am scarce\r\ncorrect when I speak of life as being extinct in that land. For, indeed,\r\nnow I think of it, I can remember that the very mud from which it sprang\r\nseemed veritably to have a fat, sluggish life of its own, so rich and\r\nviscid was it.\r\n\r\nPresently it was midday; yet was there but little change in the nature of\r\nthe surrounding wastes; though it may be that the vegetation was\r\nsomething thicker, and more continuous along the banks. But the banks\r\nwere still of the same thick, clinging mud; so that nowhere could we\r\neffect a landing; though, had we, the rest of the country beyond the\r\nbanks seemed no better.\r\n\r\nAnd all the while, as we pulled, we glanced continuously from bank to\r\nbank; and those who worked not at the oars were fain to rest a hand by\r\ntheir sheath-knives; for the happenings of the past night were\r\ncontinually in our minds, and we were in great fear; so that we had\r\nturned back to the sea but that we had come so nigh to the end of our\r\nprovisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Ship in the Creek\r\n\r\n\r\nThen, it was nigh on to evening, we came upon a creek opening into the\r\ngreater one through the bank upon our left. We had been like to pass\r\nit--as, indeed, we had passed many throughout the day--but that the\r\nbo'sun, whose boat had the lead, cried out that there was some craft\r\nlying-up, a little beyond the first bend. And, indeed, so it seemed; for\r\none of the masts of her--all jagged, where it had carried away--stuck up\r\nplain to our view.\r\n\r\nNow, having grown sick with so much lonesomeness, and being in fear of\r\nthe approaching night, we gave out something near to a cheer, which,\r\nhowever, the bo'sun silenced, having no knowledge of those who might\r\noccupy the stranger. And so, in silence, the bo'sun turned his craft\r\ntoward the creek, whereat we followed, taking heed to keep quietness, and\r\nworking the oars warily. So, in a little, we came to the shoulder of the\r\nbend, and had plain sight of the vessel some little way beyond us. From\r\nthe distance she had no appearance of being inhabited; so that after some\r\nsmall hesitation, we pulled towards her, though still being at pains to\r\nkeep silence.\r\n\r\nThe strange vessel lay against that bank of the creek which was upon our\r\nright, and over above her was a thick clump of the stunted trees. For the\r\nrest, she appeared to be firmly imbedded in the heavy mud, and there was\r\na certain look of age about her which carried to me a doleful suggestion\r\nthat we should find naught aboard of her fit for an honest stomach.\r\n\r\nWe had come to a distance of maybe some ten fathoms from her starboard\r\nbow--for she lay with her head down towards the mouth of the little\r\ncreek--when the bo'sun bade his men to back water, the which Josh did\r\nregarding our own boat. Then, being ready to fly if we had been in\r\ndanger, the bo'sun hailed the stranger; but got no reply, save that some\r\necho of his shout seemed to come back at us. And so he sung out again to\r\nher, chance there might be some below decks who had not caught his first\r\nhail; but, for the second time, no answer came to us, save the low\r\necho--naught, but that the silent trees took on a little quivering, as\r\nthough his voice had shaken them.\r\n\r\nAt that, being confident now within our minds, we laid alongside, and, in\r\na minute had shinned up the oars and so gained her decks. Here, save that\r\nthe glass of the skylight of the main cabin had been broken, and some\r\nportion of the framework shattered, there was no extraordinary litter; so\r\nthat it appeared to us as though she had been no great while abandoned.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the bo'sun had made his way up from the boat, he turned aft\r\ntoward the scuttle, the rest of us following. We found the leaf of the\r\nscuttle pulled forward to within an inch of closing, and so much effort\r\ndid it require of us to push it back, that we had immediate evidence of a\r\nconsiderable time since any had gone down that way.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was no great while before we were below, and here we found\r\nthe main cabin to be empty, save for the bare furnishings. From it there\r\nopened off two state-rooms at the forrard end, and the captain's cabin in\r\nthe after part, and in all of these we found matters of clothing and\r\nsundries such as proved that the vessel had been deserted apparently in\r\nhaste. In further proof of this we found, in a drawer in the captain's\r\nroom, a considerable quantity of loose gold, the which it was not to be\r\nsupposed would have been left by the free-will of the owner.\r\n\r\nOf the staterooms, the one upon the starboard side gave evidence that it\r\nhad been occupied by a woman--no doubt a passenger. The other, in which\r\nthere were two bunks, had been shared, so far as we could have any\r\ncertainty, by a couple of young men; and this we gathered by observation\r\nof various garments which were scattered carelessly about.\r\n\r\nYet it must not be supposed that we spent any great time in the cabins;\r\nfor we were pressed for food, and made haste--under the directing of\r\nthe bo'sun--to discover if the hulk held victuals whereby we might be\r\nkept alive.\r\n\r\nTo this end, we removed the hatch which led down to the lazarette, and,\r\nlighting two lamps which we had with us in the boats, went down to make a\r\nsearch. And so, in a little while, we came upon two casks which the\r\nbo'sun broke open with a hatchet. These casks were sound and tight, and\r\nin them was ship's biscuit, very good and fit for food. At this, as may\r\nbe imagined, we felt eased in our minds, knowing that there was no\r\nimmediate fear of starvation. Following this, we found a barrel of\r\nmolasses; a cask of rum; some cases of dried fruit--these were mouldy and\r\nscarce fit to be eaten; a cask of salt beef, another of pork; a small\r\nbarrel of vinegar; a case of brandy; two barrels of flour--one of which\r\nproved to be damp-struck; and a bunch of tallow dips.\r\n\r\nIn a little while we had all these things up in the big cabin, so that\r\nwe might come at them the better to make choice of that which was fit for\r\nour stomachs, and that which was otherwise. Meantime, whilst the bo'sun\r\noverhauled these matters, Josh called a couple of the men, and went on\r\ndeck to bring up the gear from the boats, for it had been decided that we\r\nshould pass the night aboard the hulk.\r\n\r\nWhen this was accomplished, Josh took a walk forward to the fo'cas'le;\r\nbut found nothing beyond two seamen's chests; a sea-bag, and some odd\r\ngear. There were, indeed, no more than ten bunks in the place; for she\r\nwas but a small brig, and had no call for a great crowd. Yet Josh was\r\nmore than a little puzzled to know what had come to the odd chests; for\r\nit was not to be supposed that there had been no more than two--and a\r\nsea-bag--among ten men. But to this, at that time, he had no answer, and\r\nso, being sharp for supper, made a return to the deck, and thence to the\r\nmain cabin.\r\n\r\nNow while he had been gone, the bo'sun had set the men to clearing out\r\nthe main cabin; after which, he had served out two biscuits apiece all\r\nround, and a tot of rum. To Josh, when he appeared, he gave the same,\r\nand, in a little, we called a sort of council; being sufficiently stayed\r\nby the food to talk.\r\n\r\nYet, before we came to speech, we made shift to light our pipes; for the\r\nbo'sun had discovered a case of tobacco in the captain's cabin, and after\r\nthis we came to the consideration of our position.\r\n\r\nWe had provender, so the bo'sun calculated, to last us for the better\r\npart of two months, and this without any great stint; but we had yet to\r\nprove if the brig held water in her casks, for that in the creek was\r\nbrackish, even so far as we had penetrated from the sea; else we had not\r\nbeen in need. To the charge of this, the bo'sun set Josh, along with two\r\nof the men. Another, he told to take charge of the galley, so long as we\r\nwere in the hulk. But for that night, he said we had no need to do\r\naught; for we had sufficient of water in the boats' breakers to last us\r\ntill the morrow. And so, in a little, the dusk began to fill the cabin;\r\nbut we talked on, being greatly content with our present ease and the\r\ngood tobacco which we enjoyed.\r\n\r\nIn a little while, one of the men cried out suddenly to us to be silent,\r\nand, in that minute, all heard it--a far, drawn-out wailing; the same\r\nwhich had come to us in the evening of the first day. At that we looked\r\nat one another through the smoke and the growing dark, and, even as we\r\nlooked, it became plainer heard, until, in a while, it was all about\r\nus--aye! it seemed to come floating down through the broken framework of\r\nthe skylight as though some weariful, unseen thing stood and cried upon\r\nthe decks above our heads.\r\n\r\nNow through all that crying, none moved; none, that is, save Josh and the\r\nbo'sun, and they went up into the scuttle to see whether anything was in\r\nsight; but they found nothing, and so came down to us; for there was no\r\nwisdom in exposing ourselves, unarmed as we were, save for our\r\nsheath-knives.\r\n\r\nAnd so, in a little, the night crept down upon the world, and still we\r\nsat within the dark cabin, none speaking, and knowing of the rest only by\r\nthe glows of their pipes.\r\n\r\nAll at once there came a low, muttered growl, stealing across the land;\r\nand immediately the crying was quenched in its sullen thunder. It died\r\naway, and there was a full minute of silence; then, once more it came,\r\nand it was nearer and more plain to the ear. I took my pipe from my\r\nmouth; for I had come again upon the great fear and uneasiness which the\r\nhappenings of the first night had bred in me, and the taste of the smoke\r\nbrought me no more pleasure. The muttered growl swept over our heads and\r\ndied away into the distance, and there was a sudden silence.\r\n\r\nThen, in that quietness, came the bo'sun's voice. He was bidding us\r\nhaste every one into the captain's cabin. As we moved to obey him, he ran\r\nto draw over the lid of the scuttle; and Josh went with him, and,\r\ntogether, they had it across; though with difficulty. When we had come\r\ninto the captain's cabin, we closed and barred the door, piling two great\r\nsea chests up against it; and so we felt near safe; for we knew that no\r\nthing, man nor beast, could come at us there. Yet, as may be supposed, we\r\nfelt not altogether secure; for there was that in the growling which now\r\nfilled the darkness, that seemed demoniac, and we knew not what horrid\r\nPowers were abroad.\r\n\r\nAnd so through the night the growling continued, seeming to be mighty\r\nnear unto us--aye! almost over our heads, and of a loudness far\r\nsurpassing all that had come to us on the previous night; so that I\r\nthanked the Almighty that we had come into shelter in the midst of so\r\nmuch fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Thing That Made Search\r\n\r\n\r\nNow at times, I fell upon sleep, as did most of the others; but, for the\r\nmost part, I lay half sleeping and half waking--being unable to attain to\r\ntrue sleep by reason of the everlasting growling above us in the night,\r\nand the fear which it bred in me. Thus, it chanced that just after\r\nmidnight, I caught a sound in the main cabin beyond the door, and\r\nimmediately I was fully waked. I sat me up and listened, and so became\r\naware that something was fumbling about the deck of the main cabin. At\r\nthat, I got to my feet and made my way to where the bo'sun lay, meaning\r\nto waken him, if he slept; but he caught me by the ankle, as I stooped to\r\nshake him, and whispered to me to keep silence; for he too had been aware\r\nof that strange noise of something fumbling beyond in the big cabin.\r\n\r\nIn a little, we crept both of us so close to the door as the chests\r\nwould allow, and there we crouched, listening; but could not tell what\r\nmanner of thing it might be which produced so strange a noise. For it\r\nwas neither shuffling, nor treading of any kind, nor yet was it the\r\nwhirr of a bat's wings, the which had first occurred to me, knowing how\r\nvampires are said to inhabit the nights in dismal places. Nor yet was it\r\nthe slurr of a snake; but rather it seemed to us to be as though a great\r\nwet cloth were being rubbed everywhere across the floor and bulkheads.\r\nWe were the better able to be certain of the truth of this likeness,\r\nwhen, suddenly, it passed across the further side of the door behind\r\nwhich we listened: at which, you may be sure, we drew backwards both of\r\nus in fright; though the door, and the chests, stood between us and that\r\nwhich rubbed against it.\r\n\r\nPresently, the sound ceased, and, listen as we might, we could no longer\r\ndistinguish it. Yet, until the morning, we dozed no more; being troubled\r\nin mind as to what manner of thing it was which had made search in the\r\nbig cabin.\r\n\r\nThen in time the day came, and the growling ceased. For a mournful while\r\nthe sad crying filled our ears, and then at last the eternal silence that\r\nfills the day hours of that dismal land fell upon us.\r\n\r\nSo, being at last in quietness, we slept, being greatly awearied. About\r\nseven in the morning, the bo'sun waked me, and I found that they had\r\nopened the door into the big cabin; but though the bo'sun and I made\r\ncareful search, we could nowhere come upon anything to tell us aught\r\nconcerning the thing which had put us so in fright. Yet, I know not if I\r\nam right in saying that we came upon nothing; for, in several places, the\r\nbulkheads had a _chafed_ look; but whether this had been there before\r\nthat night, we had no means of telling.\r\n\r\nOf that which we had heard, the bo'sun bade me make no mention, for he\r\nwould not have the men put more in fear than need be. This I conceived to\r\nbe wisdom, and so held my peace. Yet I was much troubled in my mind to\r\nknow what manner of thing it was which we had need to fear, and more--I\r\ndesired greatly to know whether we should be free of it in the daylight\r\nhours; for there was always with me, as I went hither and thither, the\r\nthought that IT--for that is how I designated it in my mind--might come\r\nupon us to our destruction.\r\n\r\nNow after breakfast, at which we had each a portion of salt pork, besides\r\nrum and biscuit (for by now the fire in the caboose had been set going),\r\nwe turned-to at various matters, under the directing of the bo'sun. Josh\r\nand two of the men made examination of the water casks, and the rest of\r\nus lifted the main hatch-covers, to make inspection of her cargo; but lo!\r\nwe found nothing, save some three feet of water in her hold.\r\n\r\nBy this time, Josh had drawn some water off from the casks; but it was\r\nmost unsuitable for drinking, being vile of smell and taste. Yet the\r\nbo'sun bade him draw some into buckets, so that the air might haply\r\npurify it; but though this was done, and the water allowed to stand\r\nthrough the morning, it was but little better.\r\n\r\nAt this, as might be imagined, we were exercised in our minds as to the\r\nmanner in which we should come upon suitable water; for by now we were\r\nbeginning to be in need of it. Yet though one said one thing, and another\r\nsaid another, no one had wit enough to call to mind any method by which\r\nour need should be satisfied. Then, when we had made an end of dining,\r\nthe bo'sun sent Josh, with four of the men, up stream, perchance after a\r\nmile or two the water should prove of sufficient freshness to meet our\r\npurpose. Yet they returned a little before sundown having no water; for\r\neverywhere it was salt.\r\n\r\nNow the bo'sun, foreseeing that it might be impossible to come upon\r\nwater, had set the man whom he had ordained to be our cook, to boiling\r\nthe creek water in three great kettles. This he had ordered to be done\r\nsoon after the boat left; and over the spout of each, he had hung a\r\ngreat pot of iron, filled with cold water from the hold--this being\r\ncooler than that from the creek--so that the steam from each kettle\r\nimpinged upon the cold surface of the iron pots, and being by this means\r\ncondensed, was caught in three buckets placed beneath them upon the floor\r\nof the caboose. In this way, enough water was collected to supply us for\r\nthe evening and the following morning; yet it was but a slow method, and\r\nwe had sore need of a speedier, were we to leave the hulk so soon as I,\r\nfor one, desired.\r\n\r\nWe made our supper before sunset, so as to be free of the crying which we\r\nhad reason to expect. After that, the bo'sun shut the scuttle, and we\r\nwent every one of us into the captain's cabin, after which we barred the\r\ndoor, as on the previous night; and well was it for us that we acted with\r\nthis prudence.\r\n\r\nBy the time that we had come into the captain's cabin, and secured the\r\ndoor, it was upon sunsetting, and as the dusk came on, so did the\r\nmelancholy wailing pass over the land; yet, being by now somewhat inured\r\nto so much strangeness, we lit our pipes, and smoked; though I observed\r\nthat none talked; for the crying without was not to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nNow, as I have said, we kept silence; but this was only for a time, and\r\nour reason for breaking it was a discovery made by George, the younger\r\napprentice. This lad, being no smoker, was fain to do something to\r\nwhile away the time, and with this intent, he had raked out the\r\ncontents of a small box, which had lain upon the deck at the side of\r\nthe forrard bulkhead.\r\n\r\nThe box had appeared filled with odd small lumber of which a part was a\r\ndozen or so grey paper wrappers, such as are used, I believe, for\r\ncarrying samples of corn; though I have seen them put to other purposes,\r\nas, indeed, was now the case. At first George had tossed these aside; but\r\nit growing darker the bo'sun lit one of the candles which we had found\r\nin the lazarette. Thus, George, who was proceeding to tidy back the\r\nrubbish which was cumbering the place, discovered something which caused\r\nhim to cry out to us his astonishment.\r\n\r\nNow, upon hearing George call out, the bo'sun bade him keep silence,\r\nthinking it was but a piece of boyish restlessness; but George drew the\r\ncandle to him, and bade us to listen; for the wrappers were covered with\r\nfine handwriting after the fashion of a woman's.\r\n\r\nEven as George told us of that which he had found we became aware that\r\nthe night was upon us; for suddenly the crying ceased, and in place\r\nthereof there came out of the far distance the low thunder of the\r\nnight-growling, that had tormented us through the past two nights. For a\r\nspace, we ceased to smoke, and sat--listening; for it was a very fearsome\r\nsound. In a very little while it seemed to surround the ship, as on the\r\nprevious nights; but at length, using ourselves to it, we resumed our\r\nsmoking, and bade George to read out to us from the writing upon the\r\npaper wrappers.\r\n\r\nThen George, though shaking somewhat in his voice, began to decipher that\r\nwhich was upon the wrappers, and a strange and awesome story it was, and\r\nbearing much upon our own concerns:--\r\n\r\n\"Now, when they discovered the spring among the trees that crown the\r\nbank, there was much rejoicing; for we had come to have much need of\r\nwater. And some, being in fear of the ship (declaring, because of all our\r\nmisfortune and the strange disappearances of their messmates and the\r\nbrother of my lover, that she was haunted by a devil), declared their\r\nintention of taking their gear up to the spring, and there making a camp.\r\nThis they conceived and carried out in the space of one afternoon; though\r\nour Captain, a good and true man, begged of them, as they valued life, to\r\nstay within the shelter of their living-place. Yet, as I have remarked,\r\nthey would none of them hark to his counseling, and, because the Mate\r\nand the bo'sun were gone he had no means of compelling them to wisdom--\"\r\n\r\nAt this point, George ceased to read, and began to rustle among the\r\nwrappers, as though in search for the continuation of the story.\r\n\r\nPresently he cried out that he could not find it, and dismay was\r\nupon his face.\r\n\r\nBut the bo'sun told him to read on from such sheets as were left; for, as\r\nhe observed, we had no knowledge if more existed; and we were fain to\r\nknow further of that spring, which, from the story, appeared to be over\r\nthe bank near to the vessel.\r\n\r\nGeorge, being thus adjured, picked up the topmost sheet; for they were,\r\nas I heard him explain to the bo'sun, all oddly numbered, and having but\r\nlittle reference one to the other. Yet we were mightily keen to know even\r\nso much as such odd scraps might tell unto us. Whereupon, George read\r\nfrom the next wrapper, which ran thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Now, suddenly, I heard the Captain cry out that there was something in\r\nthe main cabin, and immediately my lover's voice calling to me to lock my\r\ndoor, and on no condition to open it. Then the door of the Captain's\r\ncabin slammed, and there came a silence, and the silence was broken by a\r\n_sound_. Now, this was the first time that I had heard the Thing make\r\nsearch through the big cabin; but, afterwards, my lover told me it had\r\nhappened aforetime, and they had told me naught, fearing to frighten me\r\nneedlessly; though now I understood why my lover had bidden me never to\r\nleave my stateroom door unbolted in the nighttime. I remember also,\r\nwondering if the noise of breaking glass that had waked me somewhat from\r\nmy dreams a night or two previously, had been the work of this\r\nindescribable Thing; for on the morning following that night, the glass\r\nin the skylight had been smashed. Thus it was that my thoughts wandered\r\nout to trifles, while yet my soul seemed ready to leap out from my bosom\r\nwith fright.\r\n\r\n\"I had, by reason of usage, come to ability to sleep despite of the\r\nfearsome growling; for I had conceived its cause to be the mutter of\r\nspirits in the night, and had not allowed myself to be unnecessarily\r\nfrightened with doleful thoughts; for my lover had assured me of our\r\nsafety, and that we should yet come to our home. And now, beyond my door,\r\nI could hear that fearsome sound of the Thing searching--\"\r\n\r\nGeorge came to a sudden pause; for the bo'sun had risen and put a great\r\nhand upon his shoulder. The lad made to speak; but the bo'sun beckoned to\r\nhim to say no word, and at that we, who had grown to nervousness through\r\nthe happenings in the story, began every one to listen. Thus we heard a\r\nsound which had escaped us in the noise of the growling without the\r\nvessel, and the interest of the reading.\r\n\r\nFor a space we kept very silent, no man doing more than let the breath go\r\nin and out of his body, and so each one of us knew that something moved\r\nwithout, in the big cabin. In a little, something touched upon our door,\r\nand it was, as I have mentioned earlier, as though a great swab rubbed\r\nand scrubbed at the woodwork. At this, the men nearest unto the door came\r\nbackwards in a surge, being put in sudden fear by reason of the Thing\r\nbeing so near; but the bo'sun held up a hand, bidding them, in a low\r\nvoice, to make no unneedful noise. Yet, as though the sounds of their\r\nmoving had been heard, the door was shaken with such violence that we\r\nwaited, everyone, expecting to see it torn from its hinges; but it stood,\r\nand we hasted to brace it by means of the bunk boards, which we placed\r\nbetween it and the two great chests, and upon these we set a third chest,\r\nso that the door was quite hid.\r\n\r\nNow, I have no remembrance whether I have put down that when we came\r\nfirst to the ship, we had found the stern window upon the larboard side\r\nto be shattered; but so it was, and the bo'sun had closed it by means of\r\na teak-wood cover which was made to go over it in stormy weather, with\r\nstout battens across, which were set tight with wedges. This he had done\r\nupon the first night, having fear that some evil thing might come upon us\r\nthrough the opening, and very prudent was this same action of his, as\r\nshall be seen. Then George cried out that something was at the cover of\r\nthe larboard window, and we stood back, growing ever more fearful because\r\nthat some evil creature was so eager to come at us. But the bo'sun, who\r\nwas a very courageous man, and calm withal, walked over to the closed\r\nwindow, and saw to it that the battens were secure; for he had knowledge\r\nsufficient to be sure, if this were so, that no creature with strength\r\nless than that of a whale could break it down, and in such case its bulk\r\nwould assure us from being molested.\r\n\r\nThen, even as he made sure of the fastenings, there came a cry of fear\r\nfrom some of the men; for there had come at the glass of the unbroken\r\nwindow, a reddish mass, which plunged up against it, sucking upon it,\r\nas it were. Then Josh, who was nearest to the table, caught up the\r\ncandle, and held it towards the Thing; thus I saw that it had the\r\nappearance of a many-flapped thing shaped as it might be, out of raw\r\nbeef--_but it was alive_.\r\n\r\nAt this, we stared, everyone being too bemused with terror to do aught\r\nto protect ourselves, even had we been possessed of weapons. And as we\r\nremained thus, an instant, like silly sheep awaiting the butcher, I\r\nheard the framework creak and crack, and there ran splits all across the\r\nglass. In another moment, the whole thing would have been torn away, and\r\nthe cabin undefended, but that the bo'sun, with a great curse at us for\r\nour landlubberly lack of use, seized the other cover, and clapped it\r\nover the window. At that, there was more help than could be made to\r\navail, and the battens and wedges were in place in a trice. That this\r\nwas no sooner accomplished than need be, we had immediate proof; for\r\nthere came a rending of wood and a splintering of glass, and after that\r\na strange yowling out in the dark, and the yowling rose above and\r\ndrowned the continuous growling that filled the night. In a little, it\r\ndied away, and in the brief silence that seemed to ensue, we heard a\r\nslobby fumbling at the teak cover; but it was well secured, and we had\r\nno immediate cause for fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe Two Faces\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the remainder of that night, I have but a confused memory. At times we\r\nheard the door shaken behind the great chests; but no harm came to it.\r\nAnd, odd whiles, there was a soft thudding and rubbing upon the decks\r\nover our heads, and once, as I recollect, the Thing made a final try at\r\nthe teak covers across the windows; but the day came at last, and found\r\nme sleeping. Indeed, we had slept beyond the noon, but that the bo'sun,\r\nmindful of our needs, waked us, and we removed the chests. Yet, for\r\nperhaps the space of a minute, none durst open the door, until the bo'sun\r\nbid us stand to one side. We faced about at him then, and saw that he\r\nheld a great cutlass in his right hand.\r\n\r\nHe called to us that there were four more of the weapons, and made a\r\nbackward motion with his left hand towards an open locker. At that, as\r\nmight be supposed, we made some haste to the place to which he pointed,\r\nand found that, among some other gear, there were three more weapons such\r\nas he held; but the fourth was a straight cut-and-thrust, and this I had\r\nthe good fortune to secure.\r\n\r\nBeing now armed, we ran to join the bo'sun; for by this he had the door\r\nopen, and was scanning the main cabin. I would remark here how a good\r\nweapon doth seem to put heart into a man; for I, who but a few, short\r\nhours since had feared for my life, was now right full of lustiness and\r\nfight; which, mayhap, was no matter for regret.\r\n\r\nFrom the main cabin, the bo'sun led up on to the deck, and I remember\r\nsome surprise at finding the lid of the scuttle even as we had left it\r\nthe previous night; but then I recollected that the skylight was broken,\r\nand there was access to the big cabin that way. Yet, I questioned within\r\nmyself as to what manner of thing it could be which ignored the\r\nconvenience of the scuttle, and descended by way of the broken skylight.\r\n\r\nWe made a search of the decks and fo'cas'le, but found nothing, and,\r\nafter that, the bo'sun stationed two of us on guard, whilst the rest went\r\nabout such duties as were needful. In a little, we came to breakfast,\r\nand, after that, we prepared to test the story upon the sample wrappers\r\nand see perchance whether there was indeed a spring of fresh water among\r\nthe trees.\r\n\r\nNow between the vessel and the trees, lay a slope of the thick mud,\r\nagainst which the vessel rested. To have scrambled up this bank had been\r\nnext to impossible, by reason of its fat richness; for, indeed, it looked\r\nfit to crawl; but that Josh called out to the bo'sun that he had come\r\nupon a ladder, lashed across the fo'cas'le head. This was brought, also\r\nseveral hatch covers. The latter were placed first upon the mud, and the\r\nladder laid upon them; by which means we were enabled to pass up to the\r\ntop of the bank without contact with the mud.\r\n\r\nHere, we entered at once among the trees; for they grew right up to the\r\nedge; but we had no trouble in making a way; for they were nowhere\r\nclose together; but standing, rather, each one in a little open space\r\nby itself.\r\n\r\nWe had gone a little way among the trees, when, suddenly, one who was\r\nwith us cried out that he could see something away on our right, and we\r\nclutched everyone his weapon the more determinedly, and went towards it.\r\nYet it proved to be but a seaman's chest, and a space further off, we\r\ndiscovered another. And so, after a little walking, we found the camp;\r\nbut there was small semblance of a camp about it; for the sail of which\r\nthe tent had been formed, was all torn and stained, and lay muddy upon\r\nthe ground. Yet the spring was all we had wished, clear and sweet, and so\r\nwe knew we might dream of deliverance.\r\n\r\nNow, upon our discovery of the spring, it might be thought that we should\r\nset up a shout to those upon the vessel; but this was not so; for there\r\nwas something in the air of the place which cast a gloom upon our\r\nspirits, and we had no disinclination to return unto the vessel.\r\n\r\nUpon coming to the brig, the bo'sun called to four of the men to go down\r\ninto the boats, and pass up the breakers: also, he collected all the\r\nbuckets belonging to the brig, and forthwith each of us was set to our\r\nwork. Some, those with the weapons, entered into the wood, and gave down\r\nthe water to those stationed upon the bank, and these, in turn, passed it\r\nto those in the vessel. To the man in the galley, the bo'sun gave command\r\nto fill a boiler with some of the most select pieces of the pork and beef\r\nfrom the casks and get them cooked so soon as might be, and so we were\r\nkept at it; for it had been determined--now that we had come upon\r\nwater--that we should stay not an hour longer in that monster-ridden\r\ncraft, and we were all agog to get the boats revictualled, and put back\r\nto the sea, from which we had too gladly escaped.\r\n\r\nSo we worked through all that remainder of the morning, and right on into\r\nthe afternoon; for we were in mortal fear of the coming dark. Towards\r\nfour o'clock, the bo'sun sent the man, who had been set to do our\r\ncooking, up to us with slices of salt meat upon biscuits, and we ate as\r\nwe worked, washing our throats with water from the spring, and so, before\r\nthe evening, we had filled our breakers, and near every vessel which was\r\nconvenient for us to take in the boats. More, some of us snatched the\r\nchance to wash our bodies; for we were sore with brine, having dipped in\r\nthe sea to keep down thirst as much as might be.\r\n\r\nNow, though it had not taken us so great a while to make a finish of our\r\nwater-carrying if matters had been more convenient; yet because of the\r\nsoftness of the ground under our feet, and the care with which we had to\r\npick our steps, and some little distance between us and the brig, it had\r\ngrown later than we desired, before we had made an end. Therefore, when\r\nthe bo'sun sent word that we should come aboard, and bring our gear, we\r\nmade all haste. Thus, as it chanced, I found that I had left my sword\r\nbeside the spring, having placed it there to have two hands for the\r\ncarrying of one of the breakers. At my remarking my loss, George, who\r\nstood near, cried out that he would run for it, and was gone in a moment,\r\nbeing greatly curious to see the spring.\r\n\r\nNow, at this moment, the bo'sun came up, and called for George; but I\r\ninformed him that he had run to the spring to bring me my sword. At this,\r\nthe bo'sun stamped his foot, and swore a great oath, declaring that he\r\nhad kept the lad by him all the day; having a wish to keep him from any\r\ndanger which the wood might hold, and knowing the lad's desire to\r\nadventure there. At this, a matter which I should have known, I\r\nreproached myself for so gross a piece of stupidity, and hastened after\r\nthe bo'sun, who had disappeared over the top of the bank. I saw his back\r\nas he passed into the wood, and ran until I was up with him; for,\r\nsuddenly, as it were, I found that a sense of chilly dampness had come\r\namong the trees; though a while before the place had been full of the\r\nwarmth of the sun. This, I put to the account of evening, which was\r\ndrawing on apace; and also, it must be borne in mind, that there were but\r\nthe two of us.\r\n\r\nWe came to the spring; but George was not to be seen, and I saw no sign\r\nof my sword. At this, the bo'sun raised his voice, and cried out the\r\nlad's name. Once he called, and again; then at the second shout we heard\r\nthe boy's shrill halloo, from some distance ahead among the trees. At\r\nthat, we ran towards the sound, plunging heavily across the ground, which\r\nwas every-where covered with a thick scum, that clogged the feet in\r\nwalking. As we ran, we hallooed, and so came upon the boy, and I saw that\r\nhe had my sword.\r\n\r\nThe bo'sun ran towards him, and caught him by the arm, speaking with\r\nanger, and commanding him to return with us immediately to the vessel.\r\n\r\nBut the lad, for reply, pointed with my sword, and we saw that he pointed\r\nat what appeared to be a bird against the trunk of one of the trees.\r\nThis, as I moved closer, I perceived to be a part of the tree, and no\r\nbird; but it had a very wondrous likeness to a bird; so much so that I\r\nwent up to it, to see if my eyes had deceived me. Yet it seemed no more\r\nthan a freak of nature, though most wondrous in its fidelity; being but\r\nan excrescence upon the trunk. With a sudden thought that it would make\r\nme a curio, I reached up to see whether I could break it away from the\r\ntree; but it was above my reach, so that I had to leave it. Yet, one\r\nthing I discovered; for, in stretching towards the protuberance, I had\r\nplaced a hand upon the tree, and its trunk was soft as pulp under my\r\nfingers, much after the fashion of a mushroom.\r\n\r\nAs we turned to go, the bo'sun inquired of George his reason for going\r\nbeyond the spring, and George told him that he had seemed to hear someone\r\ncalling to him among the trees, and there had been so much pain in the\r\nvoice that he had run towards it; but been unable to discover the owner.\r\nImmediately afterwards he had seen the curious, bird-like excrescence\r\nupon a tree nearby. Then we had called, and of the rest we had knowledge.\r\n\r\nWe had come nigh to the spring on our return journey, when a sudden low\r\nwhine seemed to run among the trees. I glanced towards the sky, and\r\nrealized that the evening was upon us. I was about to remark upon this to\r\nthe bo'sun, when, abruptly, he came to a stand, and bent forward to stare\r\ninto the shadows to our right. At that, George and I turned ourselves\r\nabout to perceive what matter it was which had attracted the attention of\r\nthe bo'sun; thus we made out a tree some twenty yards away, which had all\r\nits branches wrapped about its trunk, much as the lash of a whip is wound\r\nabout its stock. Now this seemed to us a very strange sight, and we made\r\nall of us toward it, to learn the reason of so extraordinary a happening.\r\n\r\nYet, when we had come close upon it, we had no means of arriving at a\r\nknowledge of that which it portended; but walked each of us around the\r\ntree, and were more astonished, after our circumnavigation of the great\r\nvegetable than before.\r\n\r\nNow, suddenly, and in the distance, I caught the far wailing that came\r\nbefore the night, and abruptly, as it seemed to me, the tree wailed at\r\nus. At that I was vastly astonished and frightened; yet, though I\r\nretreated, I could not withdraw my gaze from the tree; but scanned it\r\nthe more intently; and, suddenly, I saw a brown, human face peering at\r\nus from between the wrapped branches. At this, I stood very still, being\r\nseized with that fear which renders one shortly incapable of movement.\r\nThen, before I had possession of myself, I saw that it was of a part\r\nwith the trunk of the tree; for I could not tell where it ended and the\r\ntree began.\r\n\r\nThen I caught the bo'sun by the arm, and pointed; for whether it was a\r\npart of the tree or not, it was a work of the devil; but the bo'sun, on\r\nseeing it, ran straightway so close to the tree that he might have\r\ntouched it with his hand, and I found myself beside him. Now, George, who\r\nwas on the bo'sun's other side, whispered that there was another face,\r\nnot unlike to a woman's, and, indeed, so soon as I perceived it, I saw\r\nthat the tree had a second excrescence, most strangely after the face of\r\na woman. Then the bo'sun cried out with an oath, at the strangeness of\r\nthe thing, and I felt the arm, which I held, shake somewhat, as it might\r\nbe with a deep emotion. Then, far away, I heard again the sound of the\r\nwailing and, immediately, from among the trees about us, there came\r\nanswering wails and a great sighing. And before I had time to be more\r\nthan aware of these things, the tree wailed again at us. And at that, the\r\nbo'sun cried out suddenly that he knew; though of what it was that he\r\n_knew_ I had at that time no knowledge. And, immediately, he began with\r\nhis cutlass to strike at the tree before us, and to cry upon God to blast\r\nit; and lo! at his smiting a very fearsome thing happened, for the tree\r\ndid bleed like any live creature. Thereafter, a great yowling came from\r\nit, and it began to writhe. And, suddenly, I became aware that all about\r\nus the trees were a-quiver.\r\n\r\nThen George cried out, and ran round upon my side of the bo'sun, and I\r\nsaw that one of the great cabbage-like things pursued him upon its stem,\r\neven as an evil serpent; and very dreadful it was, for it had become\r\nblood red in color; but I smote it with the sword, which I had taken from\r\nthe lad, and it fell to the ground.\r\n\r\nNow from the brig I heard them hallooing, and the trees had become\r\nlike live things, and there was a vast growling in the air, and\r\nhideous trumpetings. Then I caught the bo'sun again by the arm, and\r\nshouted to him that we must run for our lives; and this we did,\r\nsmiting with our swords as we ran; for there came things at us, out\r\nfrom the growing dusk.\r\n\r\nThus we made the brig, and, the boats being ready, I scrambled after the\r\nbo'sun into his, and we put straightway into the creek, all of us,\r\npulling with so much haste as our loads would allow. As we went I looked\r\nback at the brig, and it seemed to me that a multitude of things hung\r\nover the bank above her, and there seemed a flicker of things moving\r\nhither and thither aboard of her. And then we were in the great creek up\r\nwhich we had come, and so, in a little, it was night.\r\n\r\nAll that night we rowed, keeping very strictly to the center of the big\r\ncreek, and all about us bellowed the vast growling, being more fearsome\r\nthan ever I had heard it, until it seemed to me that we had waked all\r\nthat land of terror to a knowledge of our presence. But, when the morning\r\ncame, so good a speed had we made, what with our fear, and the current\r\nbeing with us, that we were nigh upon the open sea; whereat each one of\r\nus raised a shout, feeling like freed prisoners.\r\n\r\nAnd so, full of thankfulness to the Almighty, we rowed outward to the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe Great Storm\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, as I have said, we came at last in safety to the open sea, and\r\nso for a time had some degree of peace; though it was long ere we\r\nthrew off all of the terror which the Land of Lonesomeness had cast\r\nover our hearts.\r\n\r\nAnd one more matter there is regarding that land, which my memory\r\nrecalls. It will be remembered that George found certain wrappers upon\r\nwhich there was writing. Now, in the haste of our leaving, he had given\r\nno thought to take them with him; yet a portion of one he found within\r\nthe side pocket of his jacket, and it ran somewhat thus:--\r\n\r\n\"But I hear my lover's voice wailing in the night, and I go to find him;\r\nfor my loneliness is not to be borne. May God have mercy upon me!\"\r\n\r\nAnd that was all.\r\n\r\nFor a day and a night we stood out from the land towards the North,\r\nhaving a steady breeze to which we set our lug sails, and so made very\r\ngood way, the sea being quiet, though with a slow, lumbering swell from\r\nthe Southward.\r\n\r\nIt was on the morning of the second day of our escape that we met with\r\nthe beginnings of our adventure into the Silent Sea, the which I am about\r\nto make as clear as I am able.\r\n\r\nThe night had been quiet, and the breeze steady until near on to the\r\ndawn, when the wind slacked away to nothing, and we lay there waiting,\r\nperchance the sun should bring the breeze with it. And this it did; but\r\nno such wind as we did desire; for when the morning came upon us, we\r\ndiscovered all that part of the sky to be full of a fiery redness, which\r\npresently spread away down to the South, so that an entire quarter of the\r\nheavens was, as it seemed to us, a mighty arc of blood-colored fire.\r\n\r\nNow, at the sight of these omens, the bo'sun gave orders to prepare the\r\nboats for the storm which we had reason to expect, looking for it in the\r\nSouth, for it was from that direction that the swell came rolling upon\r\nus. With this intent, we roused out so much heavy canvas as the boats\r\ncontained, for we had gotten a bolt and a half from the hulk in the\r\ncreek; also the boat covers which we could lash down to the brass studs\r\nunder the gunnels of the boats. Then, in each boat, we mounted the\r\nwhaleback--which had been stowed along the tops of the thwarts--also its\r\nsupports, lashing the same to the thwarts below the knees. Then we laid\r\ntwo lengths of the stout canvas the full length of the boat over the\r\nwhaleback, overlapping and nailing them to the same, so that they sloped\r\naway down over the gunnels upon each side as though they had formed a\r\nroof to us. Here, whilst some stretched the canvas, nailing its lower\r\nedges to the gunnels, others were employed in lashing together the oars\r\nand the mast, and to this bundle they secured a considerable length of\r\nnew three-and-a-half-inch hemp rope, which we had brought away from the\r\nhulk along with the canvas. This rope was then passed over the bows and\r\nin through the painter ring, and thence to the forrard thwarts, where it\r\nwas made fast, and we gave attention to parcel it with odd strips of\r\ncanvas against danger of chafe. And the same was done in both of the\r\nboats, for we could not put our trust in the painters, besides which they\r\nhad not sufficient length to secure safe and easy riding.\r\n\r\nNow by this time we had the canvas nailed down to the gunnels around our\r\nboat, after which we spread the boat-cover over it, lacing it down to the\r\nbrass studs beneath the gunnel. And so we had all the boat covered in,\r\nsave a place in the stern where a man might stand to wield the steering\r\noar, for the boats were double bowed. And in each boat we made the same\r\npreparation, lashing all movable articles, and preparing to meet so great\r\na storm as might well fill the heart with terror; for the sky cried out\r\nto us that it would be no light wind, and further, the great swell from\r\nthe South grew more huge with every hour that passed; though as yet it\r\nwas without virulence, being slow and oily and black against the redness\r\nof the sky.\r\n\r\nPresently we were ready, and had cast over the bundle of oars and the\r\nmast, which was to serve as our sea anchor, and so we lay waiting. It was\r\nat this time that the bo'sun called over to Josh certain advice with\r\nregard to that which lay before us. And after that the two of them\r\nsculled the boats a little apart; for there might be a danger of their\r\nbeing dashed together by the first violence of the storm.\r\n\r\nAnd so came a time of waiting, with Josh and the bo'sun each of them at\r\nthe steering oars, and the rest of us stowed away under the coverings.\r\nFrom where I crouched near the bo'sun, I had sight of Josh away upon our\r\nport side: he was standing up black as a shape of night against the\r\nmighty redness, when the boat came to the foamless crowns of the swells,\r\nand then gone from sight in the hollows between.\r\n\r\nNow midday had come and gone, and we had made shift to eat so good a\r\nmeal as our appetites would allow; for we had no knowledge how long it\r\nmight be ere we should have chance of another, if, indeed, we had ever\r\nneed to think more of such. And then, in the middle part of the\r\nafternoon, we heard the first cryings of the storm--a far-distant\r\nmoaning, rising and falling most solemnly.\r\n\r\nPresently, all the Southern part of the horizon so high up, maybe, as\r\nsome seven to ten degrees, was blotted out by a great black wall of\r\ncloud, over which the red glare came down upon the great swells as though\r\nfrom the light of some vast and unseen fire. It was about this time, I\r\nobserved that the sun had the appearance of a great full moon, being pale\r\nand clearly defined, and seeming to have no warmth nor brilliancy; and\r\nthis, as may be imagined, seemed most strange to us, the more so because\r\nof the redness in the South and East.\r\n\r\nAnd all this while the swells increased most prodigiously; though without\r\nmaking broken water: yet they informed us that we had done well to take\r\nso much precaution; for surely they were raised by a very great storm. A\r\nlittle before evening, the moaning came again, and then a space of\r\nsilence; after which there rose a very sudden bellowing, as of wild\r\nbeasts, and then once more the silence.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the bo'sun making no objection, I raised my head above\r\nthe cover until I was in a standing position; for, until now, I had taken\r\nno more than occasional peeps; and I was very glad of the chance to\r\nstretch my limbs; for I had grown mightily cramped. Having stirred the\r\nsluggishness of my blood, I sat me down again; but in such position that\r\nI could see every part of the horizon without difficulty. Ahead of us,\r\nthat is to the South, I saw now that the great wall of cloud had risen\r\nsome further degrees, and there was something less of the redness;\r\nthough, indeed, what there was left of it was sufficiently terrifying;\r\nfor it appeared to crest the black cloud like red foam, seeming, it might\r\nbe, as though a mighty sea made ready to break over the world.\r\n\r\nTowards the West, the sun was sinking behind a curious red-tinted haze,\r\nwhich gave it the appearance of a dull red disk. To the North, seeming\r\nvery high in the sky, were some flecks of cloud lying motionless, and of\r\na very pretty rose color. And here I may remark that all the sea to the\r\nNorth of us appeared as a very ocean of dull red fire; though, as might\r\nbe expected, the swells, coming up from the South, against the light were\r\nso many exceeding great hills of blackness.\r\n\r\nIt was just after I had made these observations that we heard again the\r\ndistant roaring of the storm, and I know not how to convey the exceeding\r\nterror of that sound. It was as though some mighty beast growled far down\r\ntowards the South; and it seemed to make very clear to me that we were\r\nbut two small craft in a very lonesome place. Then, even while the\r\nroaring lasted, I saw a sudden light flare up, as it were from the edge\r\nof the Southern horizon. It had somewhat the appearance of lightning; yet\r\nvanished not immediately, as is the wont of lightning; and more, it had\r\nnot been my experience to witness such spring up from out of the sea,\r\nbut, rather, down from the heavens. Yet I have little doubt but that it\r\nwas a form of lightning; for it came many times after this, so that I had\r\nchance to observe it minutely. And frequently, as I watched, the storm\r\nwould shout at us in a most fearsome manner.\r\n\r\nThen, when the sun was low upon the horizon, there came to our ears a\r\nvery shrill, screaming noise, most penetrating and distressing, and,\r\nimmediately afterwards the bo'sun shouted out something in a hoarse\r\nvoice, and commenced to sway furiously upon the steering oar. I saw his\r\nstare fixed upon a point a little on our larboard bow, and perceived that\r\nin that direction the sea was all blown up into vast clouds of dust-like\r\nfroth, and I knew that the storm was upon us. Immediately afterwards a\r\ncold blast struck us; but we suffered no harm, for the bo'sun had gotten\r\nthe boat bows-on by this. The wind passed us, and there was an instant of\r\ncalm. And now all the air above us was full of a continuous roaring, so\r\nvery loud and intense that I was like to be deafened. To windward, I\r\nperceived an enormous wall of spray bearing down upon us, and I heard\r\nagain the shrill screaming, pierce through the roaring. Then, the bo'sun\r\nwhipped in his oar under the cover, and, reaching forward, drew the\r\ncanvas aft, so that it covered the entire boat, and he held it down\r\nagainst the gunnel upon the starboard side, shouting in my ear to do\r\nlikewise upon the larboard. Now had it not been for this forethought on\r\nthe part of the bo'sun we had been all dead men; and this may be the\r\nbetter believed when I explain that we felt the water falling upon the\r\nstout canvas overhead, tons and tons, though so beaten to froth as to\r\nlack solidity to sink or crush us. I have said \"felt\"; for I would make\r\nit so clear as may be, here once and for all, that so intense was the\r\nroaring and screaming of the elements, there could no sound have\r\npenetrated to us, no! not the pealing of mighty thunders. And so for the\r\nspace of maybe a full minute the boat quivered and shook most vilely, so\r\nthat she seemed like to have been shaken in pieces, and from a dozen\r\nplaces between the gunnel and the covering canvas, the water spurted in\r\nupon us. And here one other thing I would make mention of: During that\r\nminute, the boat had ceased to rise and fall upon the great swell, and\r\nwhether this was because the sea was flattened by the first rush of the\r\nwind, or that the excess of the storm held her steady, I am unable to\r\ntell; and can put down only that which we felt.\r\n\r\nNow, in a little, the first fury of the blast being spent, the boat\r\nbegan to sway from side to side, as though the wind blew now upon the one\r\nbeam, and now upon the other; and several times we were stricken heavily\r\nwith the blows of solid water. But presently this ceased, and we returned\r\nonce again to the rise and fall of the swell, only that now we received a\r\ncruel jerk every time that the boat came upon the top of a sea. And so a\r\nwhile passed.\r\n\r\nTowards midnight, as I should judge, there came some mighty flames of\r\nlightning, so bright that they lit up the boat through the double\r\ncovering of canvas; yet no man of us heard aught of the thunder; for the\r\nroaring of the storm made all else a silence.\r\n\r\nAnd so to the dawn, after which, finding that we were still, by the mercy\r\nof God, possessed of our lives, we made shift to eat and drink; after\r\nwhich we slept.\r\n\r\nNow, being extremely wearied by the stress of the past night, I slumbered\r\nthrough many hours of the storm, waking at some time between noon and\r\nevening. Overhead, as I lay looking upwards, the canvas showed of a dull\r\nleadenish color, blackened completely at whiles by the dash of spray and\r\nwater. And so, presently, having eaten again, and feeling that all things\r\nlay in the hands of the Almighty, I came once more upon sleep.\r\n\r\nTwice through the following night was I wakened by the boat being hurled\r\nupon her beam-ends by the blows of the seas; but she righted easily, and\r\ntook scarce any water, the canvas proving a very roof of safety. And so\r\nthe morning came again.\r\n\r\nBeing now rested, I crawled after to where the bo'sun lay, and, the noise\r\nof the storm lulling odd instants, shouted in his ear to know whether the\r\nwind was easing at whiles. To this he nodded, whereat I felt a most\r\njoyful sense of hope pulse through me, and ate such food as could be\r\ngotten, with a very good relish.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, the sun broke out suddenly, lighting up the boat most\r\ngloomily through the wet canvas; yet a very welcome light it was, and\r\nbred in us a hope that the storm was near to breaking. In a little, the\r\nsun disappeared; but, presently, it coming again, the bo'sun beckoned to\r\nme to assist him, and we removed such temporary nails as we had used to\r\nfasten down the after part of the canvas, and pushed back the covering a\r\nspace sufficient to allow our heads to go through into the daylight. On\r\nlooking out, I discovered the air to be full of spray, beaten as fine as\r\ndust, and then, before I could note aught else, a little gout of water\r\ntook me in the face with such force as to deprive me of breath; so that I\r\nhad to descend beneath the canvas for a little while.\r\n\r\nSo soon as I was recovered, I thrust forth my head again, and now I had\r\nsome sight of the terrors around us. As each huge sea came towards us,\r\nthe boat shot up to meet it, right up to its very crest, and there, for\r\nthe space of some instants, we would seem to be swamped in a very ocean\r\nof foam, boiling up on each side of the boat to the height of many feet.\r\nThen, the sea passing from under us, we would go swooping dizzily down\r\nthe great, black, froth-splotched back of the wave, until the oncoming\r\nsea caught us up most mightily. Odd whiles, the crest of a sea would hurl\r\nforward before we had reached the top, and though the boat shot upward\r\nlike a veritable feather, yet the water would swirl right over us, and we\r\nwould have to draw in our heads most suddenly; in such cases the wind\r\nflapping the cover down so soon as our hands were removed. And, apart\r\nfrom the way in which the boat met the seas, there was a very sense of\r\nterror in the air; the continuous roaring and howling of the storm; the\r\n_screaming_ of the foam, as the frothy summits of the briny mountains\r\nhurled past us, and the wind that tore the breath out of our weak human\r\nthroats, are things scarce to be conceived.\r\n\r\nPresently, we drew in our heads, the sun having vanished again, and\r\nnailed down the canvas once more, and so prepared for the night.\r\n\r\nFrom here on until the morning, I have very little knowledge of any\r\nhappenings; for I slept much of the time, and, for the rest, there was\r\nlittle to know, cooped up beneath the cover. Nothing save the\r\ninterminable, thundering swoop of the boat downwards, and then the halt\r\nand upward hurl, and the occasional plunges and surges to larboard or\r\nstarboard, occasioned, I can only suppose, by the indiscriminate might\r\nof the seas.\r\n\r\nI would make mention here, how that I had little thought all this while\r\nfor the peril of the other boat, and, indeed, I was so very full of our\r\nown that it is no matter at which to wonder. However, as it proved, and\r\nas this is a most suitable place in which to tell it, the boat that held\r\nJosh and the rest of the crew came through the storm with safety; though\r\nit was not until many years afterwards that I had the good fortune to\r\nhear from Josh himself how that, after the storm, they were picked up by\r\na homeward-bound vessel, and landed in the Port of London.\r\n\r\nAnd now, to our own happenings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe Weed-Choked Sea\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was some little while before midday that we grew conscious that the\r\nsea had become very much less violent; and this despite the wind roaring\r\nwith scarce abated noise. And, presently, everything about the boat,\r\nsaving the wind, having grown indubitably calmer, and no great water\r\nbreaking over the canvas, the bo'sun beckoned me again to assist him lift\r\nthe after part of the cover. This we did, and put forth our heads to\r\ninquire the reason of the unexpected quietness of the sea; not knowing\r\nbut that we had come suddenly under the lee of some unknown land. Yet,\r\nfor a space, we could see nothing, beyond the surrounding billows; for\r\nthe sea was still very furious, though no matter to cause us concern,\r\nafter that through which we had come.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, the bo'sun, raising himself, saw something, and,\r\nbending cried in my ear that there was a low bank which broke the force\r\nof the sea; but he was full of wonder to know how that we had passed it\r\nwithout shipwreck. And whilst he was still pondering the matter I raised\r\nmyself, and took a look on all sides of us, and so I discovered that\r\nthere lay another great bank upon our larboard side, and this I pointed\r\nout to him. Immediately afterwards, we came upon a great mass of seaweed\r\nswung up on the crest of a sea, and, presently, another. And so we\r\ndrifted on, and the seas grew less with astonishing rapidity, so that, in\r\na little, we stripped off the cover so far as the midship thwart; for the\r\nrest of the men were sorely in need of the fresh air, after so long a\r\ntime below the canvas covering.\r\n\r\nIt was after we had eaten, that one of them made out that there was\r\nanother low bank astern upon which we were drifting. At that, the bo'sun\r\nstood up and made an examination of it, being much exercised in his mind\r\nto know how we might come clear of it with safety. Presently, however, we\r\nhad come so near to it that we discovered it to be composed of seaweed,\r\nand so we let the boat drive upon it, making no doubt but that the other\r\nbanks, which we had seen, were of a similar nature.\r\n\r\nIn a little, we had driven in among the weed; yet, though our speed was\r\ngreatly slowed, we made some progress, and so in time came out upon the\r\nother side, and now we found the sea to be near quiet, so that we hauled\r\nin our sea anchor--which had collected a great mass of weed about it--and\r\nremoved the whaleback and canvas coverings, after which we stepped the\r\nmast, and set a tiny storm-foresail upon the boat; for we wished to have\r\nher under control, and could set no more than this, because of the\r\nviolence of the breeze.\r\n\r\nThus we drove on before the wind, the bo'sun steering, and avoiding all\r\nsuch banks as showed ahead, and ever the sea grew calmer. Then, when it\r\nwas near on to evening, we discovered a huge stretch of the weed that\r\nseemed to block all the sea ahead, and, at that, we hauled down the\r\nforesail, and took to our oars, and began to pull, broadside on to it,\r\ntowards the West. Yet so strong was the breeze, that we were being driven\r\ndown rapidly upon it. And then, just before sunset, we opened out the\r\nend of it, and drew in our oars, very thankful to set the little\r\nforesail, and run off again before the wind.\r\n\r\nAnd so, presently, the night came down upon us, and the bo'sun made us\r\ntake turn and turn about to keep a look-out; for the boat was going some\r\nknots through the water, and we were among strange seas; but _he_ took no\r\nsleep all that night, keeping always to the steering oar.\r\n\r\nI have memory, during my time of watching, of passing odd floating\r\nmasses, which I make no doubt were weed, and once we drove right atop of\r\none; but drew clear without much trouble. And all the while, through the\r\ndark to starboard, I could make out the dim outline of that enormous weed\r\nextent lying low upon the sea, and seeming without end. And so,\r\npresently, my time to watch being at an end, I returned to my slumber,\r\nand when next I waked it was morning.\r\n\r\nNow the morning discovered to me that there was no end to the weed upon\r\nour starboard side; for it stretched away into the distance ahead of us\r\nso far as we could see; while all about us the sea was full of floating\r\nmasses of the stuff. And then, suddenly, one of the men cried out that\r\nthere was a vessel in among the weed. At that, as may be imagined, we\r\nwere very greatly excited, and stood upon the thwarts that we might get\r\nbetter view of her. Thus I saw her a great way in from the edge of the\r\nweed, and I noted that her foremast was gone near to the deck, and she\r\nhad no main topmast; though, strangely enough, her mizzen stood unharmed.\r\nAnd beyond this, I could make out but little, because of the distance;\r\nthough the sun, which was upon our larboard side, gave me some sight of\r\nher hull, but not much, because of the weed in which she was deeply\r\nembedded; yet it seemed to me that her sides were very weather-worn, and\r\nin one place some glistening brown object, which may have been a fungus,\r\ncaught the rays of the sun, sending off a wet sheen.\r\n\r\nThere we stood, all of us, upon the thwarts, staring and exchanging\r\nopinions, and were like to have overset the boat; but that the bo'sun\r\nordered us down. And after this we made our breakfast, and had much\r\ndiscussion regarding the stranger, as we ate.\r\n\r\nLater, towards midday, we were able to set our mizzen; for the storm had\r\ngreatly mollified, and so, presently, we hauled away to the West, to\r\nescape a great bank of the weed which ran out from the main body. Upon\r\nrounding this, we let the boat off again, and set the main lug, and thus\r\nmade very good speed before the wind. Yet though we ran all that\r\nafternoon parallel with the weed to starboard, we came not to its end.\r\nAnd three separate times we saw the hulks of rotting vessels, some of\r\nthem having the appearance of a previous age, so ancient did they seem.\r\n\r\nNow, towards evening, the wind dropped to a very little breeze, so that\r\nwe made but slow way, and thus we had better chance to study the weed.\r\nAnd now we saw that it was full of crabs; though for the most part so\r\nvery minute as to escape the casual glance; yet they were not all small,\r\nfor in a while I discovered a swaying among the weed, a little way in\r\nfrom the edge, and immediately I saw the mandible of a very great crab\r\nstir amid the weed. At that, hoping to obtain it for food, I pointed it\r\nout to the bo'sun, suggesting that we should try and capture it. And so,\r\nthere being by now scarce any wind, he bade us get out a couple of the\r\noars, and back the boat up to the weed. This we did, after which he made\r\nfast a piece of salt meat to a bit of spun yarn, and bent this on to the\r\nboat hook. Then he made a running bowline, and slipped the loop on to the\r\nshaft of the boat hook, after which he held out the boat hook, after the\r\nfashion of a fishing rod, over the place where I had seen the crab.\r\nAlmost immediately, there swept up an enormous claw, and grasped the\r\nmeat, and at that, the bo'sun cried out to me to take an oar and slide\r\nthe bowline along the boat-hook, so that it should fall over the claw,\r\nand this I did, and immediately some of us hauled upon the line,\r\ntaughtening it about the great claw. Then the bo'sun sung out to us to\r\nhaul the crab aboard, that we had it most securely; yet on the instant we\r\nhad reason to wish that we had been less successful; for the creature,\r\nfeeling the tug of our pull upon it, tossed the weed in all directions,\r\nand thus we had full sight of it, and discovered it to be so great a crab\r\nas is scarce conceivable--a very monster. And further, it was apparent to\r\nus that the brute had no fear of us, nor intention to escape; but rather\r\nmade to come at us; whereat the bo'sun, perceiving our danger, cut the\r\nline, and bade us put weight upon the oars, and so in a moment we were in\r\nsafety, and very determined to have no more meddlings with such\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\nPresently, the night came upon us, and, the wind remaining low, there\r\nwas everywhere about us a great stillness, most solemn after the\r\ncontinuous roaring of the storm which had beset us in the previous days.\r\nYet now and again a little wind would rise and blow across the sea, and\r\nwhere it met the weed, there would come a low, damp rustling, so that I\r\ncould hear the passage of it for no little time after the calm had come\r\nonce more all about us.\r\n\r\nNow it is a strange thing that I, who had slept amid the noise of the\r\npast days, should find sleeplessness amid so much calm; yet so it was,\r\nand presently I took the steering oar, proposing that the rest should\r\nsleep, and to this the bo'sun agreed, first warning me, however, most\r\nparticularly to have care that I kept the boat off the weed (for we had\r\nstill a little way on us), and, further, to call him should anything\r\nunforeseen occur. And after that, almost immediately he fell asleep, as\r\nindeed did the most of the men.\r\n\r\nFrom the time that I relieved the bo'sun, until midnight, I sat upon the\r\ngunnel of the boat, with the steering oar under my arm, and watched and\r\nlistened, most full of a sense of the strangeness of the seas into\r\nwhich we had come. It is true that I had heard tell of seas choked up\r\nwith weed--seas that were full of stagnation, having no tides; but I\r\nhad not thought to come upon such an one in my wanderings; having,\r\nindeed, set down such tales as being bred of imagination, and without\r\nreality in fact.\r\n\r\nThen, a little before the dawn, and when the sea was yet full of\r\ndarkness, I was greatly startled to hear a prodigious splash amid the\r\nweed, mayhaps at a distance of some hundred yards from the boat. Then,\r\nas I stood full of alertness, and knowing not what the next moment\r\nmight bring forth, there came to me across the immense waste of weed, a\r\nlong, mournful cry, and then again the silence. Yet, though I kept very\r\nquiet, there came no further sound, and I was about to re-seat myself,\r\nwhen, afar off in that strange wilderness, there flashed out a sudden\r\nflame of fire.\r\n\r\nNow upon seeing fire in the midst of so much lonesomeness, I was as one\r\namazed, and could do naught but stare. Then, my judgment returning to me,\r\nI stooped and waked the bo'sun; for it seemed to me that this was a\r\nmatter for his attention. He, after staring at it awhile, declared that\r\nhe could see the shape of a vessel's hull beyond the flame; but,\r\nimmediately, he was in doubt, as, indeed, I had been all the while. And\r\nthen, even as we peered, the light vanished, and though we waited for the\r\nspace of some minutes; watching steadfastly, there came no further sight\r\nof that strange illumination.\r\n\r\nFrom now until the dawn, the bo'sun remained awake with me, and we talked\r\nmuch upon that which we had seen; yet could come to no satisfactory\r\nconclusion; for it seemed impossible to us that a place of so much\r\ndesolation could contain any living being. And then, just as the dawn was\r\nupon us, there loomed up a fresh wonder--the hull of a great vessel maybe\r\na couple or three score fathoms in from the edge of the weed. Now the\r\nwind was still very light, being no more than an occasional breath, so\r\nthat we went past her at a drift, thus the dawn had strengthened\r\nsufficiently to give to us a clear sight of the stranger, before we had\r\ngone more than a little past her. And now I perceived that she lay full\r\nbroadside on to us, and that her three masts were gone close down to the\r\ndeck. Her side was streaked in places with rust, and in others a green\r\nscum overspread her; but it was no more than a glance that I gave at any\r\nof those matters; for I had spied something which drew all my\r\nattention--great leathery arms splayed all across her side, some of them\r\ncrooked inboard over the rail, and then, low down, seen just above the\r\nweed, the huge, brown, glistening bulk of so great a monster as ever I\r\nhad conceived. The bo'sun saw it in the same instant and cried out in a\r\nhoarse whisper that it was a mighty devilfish, and then, even as he\r\nspoke, two of the arms flickered up into the cold light of the dawn, as\r\nthough the creature had been asleep, and we had waked it. At that, the\r\nbo'sun seized an oar, and I did likewise, and, so swiftly as we dared,\r\nfor fear of making any unneedful noise, we pulled the boat to a safer\r\ndistance. From there and until the vessel had become indistinct by reason\r\nof the space we put between us, we watched that great creature clutched\r\nto the old hull, as it might be a limpet to a rock.\r\n\r\nPresently, when it was broad day, some of the men began to rouse up, and\r\nin a little we broke our fast, which was not displeasing to me, who had\r\nspent the night watching. And so through the day we sailed with a very\r\nlight wind upon our larboard quarter. And all the while we kept the\r\ngreat waste of weed upon our starboard side, and apart from the mainland\r\nof the weed, as it were, there were scattered about an uncountable\r\nnumber of weed islets and banks, and there were thin patches of it that\r\nappeared scarce above the water, and through these later we let the boat\r\nsail; for they had not sufficient density to impede our progress more\r\nthan a little.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when the day was far spent, we came in sight of another\r\nwreck amid the weeds. She lay in from the edge perhaps so much as the\r\nhalf of a mile, and she had all three of her lower masts in, and her\r\nlower yards squared. But what took our eyes more than aught else was a\r\ngreat superstructure which had been built upward from her rails,\r\nalmost half-way to her main tops, and this, as we were able to\r\nperceive, was supported by ropes let down from the yards; but of what\r\nmaterial the superstructure was composed, I have no knowledge; for it\r\nwas so over-grown with some form of green stuff--as was so much of the\r\nhull as showed above the weed--as to defy our guesses. And because of\r\nthis growth, it was borne upon us that the ship must have been lost to\r\nthe world a very great age ago. At this suggestion, I grew full of\r\nsolemn thought; for it seemed to me that we had come upon the cemetery\r\nof the oceans.\r\n\r\nNow, in a little while after we had passed this ancient craft, the night\r\ncame down upon us, and we prepared for sleep, and because the boat was\r\nmaking some little way through the water, the bo'sun gave out that each\r\nof us should stand our turn at the steering-oar, and that he was to be\r\ncalled should any fresh matter transpire. And so we settled down for the\r\nnight, and owing to my previous sleeplessness, I was full weary, so that\r\nI knew nothing until the one whom I was to relieve shook me into\r\nwakefulness. So soon as I was fully waked, I perceived that a low moon\r\nhung above the horizon, and shed a very ghostly light across the great\r\nweed world to starboard. For the rest, the night was exceeding quiet, so\r\nthat no sound came to me in all that ocean, save the rippling of the\r\nwater upon our bends as the boat forged slowly along. And so I settled\r\ndown to pass the time ere I should be allowed to sleep; but first I asked\r\nthe man whom I had relieved, how long a time had passed since moon-rise;\r\nto which he replied that it was no more than the half of an hour, and\r\nafter that I questioned whether he had seen aught strange amid the weed\r\nduring his time at the oar; but he had seen nothing, except that once he\r\nhad fancied a light had shown in the midst of the waste; yet it could\r\nhave been naught save a humor of the imagination; though apart from this,\r\nhe had heard a strange crying a little after midnight, and twice there\r\nhad been great splashes among the weed. And after that he fell asleep,\r\nbeing impatient at my questioning.\r\n\r\nNow it so chanced that my watch had come just before the dawn; for which\r\nI was full of thankfulness, being in that frame of mind when the dark\r\nbreeds strange and unwholesome fancies. Yet, though I was so near to the\r\ndawn, I was not to escape free of the eerie influence of that place; for,\r\nas I sat, running my gaze to and fro over its grey immensity, it came to\r\nme that there were strange movements among the weed, and I seemed to see\r\nvaguely, as one may see things in dreams, dim white faces peer out at me\r\nhere and there; yet my common sense assured me that I was but deceived by\r\nthe uncertain light and the sleep in my eyes; yet for all that, it put my\r\nnerves on the quiver.\r\n\r\nA little later, there came to my ears the noise of a very great splash\r\namid the weed; but though I stared with intentness, I could nowhere\r\ndiscern aught as likely to be the cause thereof. And then, suddenly,\r\nbetween me and the moon, there drove up from out of that great waste a\r\nvast bulk, flinging huge masses of weed in all directions. It seemed to\r\nbe no more than a hundred fathoms distant, and, against the moon, I saw\r\nthe outline of it most clearly--a mighty devilfish. Then it had fallen\r\nback once more with a prodigious splash, and so the quiet fell again,\r\nfinding me sore afraid, and no little bewildered that so monstrous a\r\ncreature could leap with such agility. And then (in my fright I had let\r\nthe boat come near to the edge of the weed) there came a subtle stir\r\nopposite to our starboard bow, and something slid down into the water. I\r\nswayed upon the oar to turn the boat's head outward, and with the same\r\nmovement leant forward and sideways to peer, bringing my face near to the\r\nboat's rail. In the same instant, I found myself looking down into a\r\nwhite demoniac face, human save that the mouth and nose had greatly the\r\nappearance of a beak. The thing was gripping at the side of the boat with\r\ntwo flickering hands--gripping the bare, smooth outer surface, in a way\r\nthat woke in my mind a sudden memory of the great devilfish which had\r\nclung to the side of the wreck we had passed in the previous dawn. I saw\r\nthe face come up towards me, and one misshapen hand fluttered almost to\r\nmy throat, and there came a sudden, hateful reek in my nostrils--foul and\r\nabominable. Then, I came into possession of my faculties, and drew back\r\nwith great haste and a wild cry of fear. And then I had the steering-oar\r\nby the middle, and was smiting downward with the loom over the side of\r\nthe boat; but the thing was gone from my sight. I remember shouting out\r\nto the bo'sun and to the men to awake, and then the bo'sun had me by the\r\nshoulder, was calling in my ear to know what dire thing had come about.\r\nAt that, I cried out that I did not know, and, presently, being somewhat\r\ncalmer, I told them of the thing that I had seen; but even as I told of\r\nit, there seemed to be no truth in it, so that they were all at a loss to\r\nknow whether I had fallen asleep, or that I had indeed seen a devil.\r\n\r\nAnd presently the dawn was upon us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nThe Island in the Weed\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was as we were all discussing the matter of the devil face that had\r\npeered up at me out of the water, that Job, the ordinary seaman,\r\ndiscovered the island in the light of the growing dawn, and, seeing it,\r\nsprang to his feet, with so loud a cry that we were like for the moment\r\nto have thought he had seen a second demon. Yet when we made discovery of\r\nthat which he had already perceived, we checked our blame at his sudden\r\nshout; for the sight of land, after so much desolation, made us very warm\r\nin our hearts.\r\n\r\nNow at first the island seemed but a very small matter; for we did not\r\nknow at that time that we viewed it from its end; yet despite this, we\r\ntook to our oars and rowed with all haste towards it, and so, coming\r\nnearer, were able to see that it had a greater size than we had imagined.\r\nPresently, having cleared the end of it, and keeping to that side which\r\nwas further from the great mass of the weed-continent, we opened out a\r\nbay that curved inward to a sandy beach, most seductive to our tired\r\neyes. Here, for the space of a minute, we paused to survey the prospect,\r\nand I saw that the island was of a very strange shape, having a great\r\nhump of black rock at either end, and dipping down into a steep valley\r\nbetween them. In this valley there seemed to be a deal of a strange\r\nvegetation that had the appearance of mighty toadstools; and down nearer\r\nthe beach there was a thick grove of a kind of very tall reed, and these\r\nwe discovered afterwards to be exceeding tough and light, having\r\nsomething of the qualities of the bamboo.\r\n\r\nRegarding the beach, it might have been most reasonably supposed that it\r\nwould be very thick with the driftweed; but this was not so, at least,\r\nnot at that time; though a projecting horn of the black rock which ran\r\nout into the sea from the upper end of the island, was thick with it.\r\n\r\nAnd now, the bo'sun having assured himself that there was no appearance\r\nof any danger, we bent to our oars, and presently had the boat aground\r\nupon the beach, and here, finding it convenient, we made our breakfast.\r\nDuring this meal, the bo'sun discussed with us the most proper thing to\r\ndo, and it was decided to push the boat off from the shore, leaving Job\r\nin her, whilst the remainder of us made some exploration of the island.\r\n\r\nAnd so, having made an end of eating, we proceeded as we had\r\ndetermined, leaving Job in the boat, ready to scull ashore for us if we\r\nwere pursued by any savage creature, while the rest of us made our way\r\ntowards the nearer hump, from which, as it stood some hundred feet\r\nabove the sea, we hoped to get a very good idea of the remainder of the\r\nisland. First, however, the bo'sun handed out to us the two cutlasses\r\nand the cut-and-thrust (the other two cutlasses being in Josh's boat),\r\nand, taking one himself, he passed me the cut-and-thrust, and gave the\r\nother cutlass to the biggest of the men. Then he bade the others keep\r\ntheir sheath knives handy, and was proceeding to lead the way, when one\r\nof them called out to us to wait a moment, and, with that, ran quickly\r\nto the clump of reeds. Here, he took one with both his hands and bent\r\nupon it; but it would not break, so that he had to notch it about with\r\nhis knife, and thus, in a little, he had it clear. After this, he cut\r\noff the upper part, which was too thin and lissome for his purpose, and\r\nthen thrust the handle of his knife into the end of the portion which\r\nhe had retained, and in this wise he had a most serviceable lance or\r\nspear. For the reeds were very strong, and hollow after the fashion of\r\nbamboo, and when he had bound some yarn about the end into which he had\r\nthrust his knife, so as to prevent it splitting, it was a fit enough\r\nweapon for any man.\r\n\r\nNow the bo'sun, perceiving the happiness of the fellow's idea, bade the\r\nrest make to themselves similar weapons, and whilst they were busy thus,\r\nhe commended the man very warmly. And so, in a little, being now most\r\ncomfortably armed, we made inland towards the nearer black hill, in very\r\ngood spirits. Presently, we were come to the rock which formed the hill,\r\nand found that it came up out of the sand with great abruptness, so that\r\nwe could not climb it on the seaward side. At that, the bo'sun led us\r\nround a space towards that side where lay the valley, and here there was\r\nunder-foot neither sand nor rock; but ground of strange and spongy\r\ntexture, and then suddenly, rounding a jutting spur of the rock, we came\r\nupon the first of the vegetation--an incredible mushroom; nay, I should\r\nsay toadstool; for it had no healthy look about it, and gave out a heavy,\r\nmouldy odor. And now we perceived that the valley was filled with them,\r\nall, that is, save a great circular patch where nothing appeared to be\r\ngrowing; though we were not yet at a sufficient height to ascertain the\r\nreason of this.\r\n\r\nPresently, we came to a place where the rock was split by a great fissure\r\nrunning up to the top, and showing many ledges and convenient shelves\r\nupon which we might obtain hold and footing. And so we set-to about\r\nclimbing, helping one another so far as we had ability, until, in about\r\nthe space of some ten minutes, we reached the top, and from thence had a\r\nvery fine view. We perceived now that there was a beach upon that side of\r\nthe island which was opposed to the weed; though, unlike that upon which\r\nwe had landed, it was greatly choked with weed which had drifted ashore.\r\nAfter that, I gave notice to see what space of water lay between the\r\nisland and the edge of the great weed-continent, and guessed it to be no\r\nmore than maybe some ninety yards, at which I fell to wishing that it had\r\nbeen greater, for I was grown much in awe of the weed and the strange\r\nthings which I conceived it to contain.\r\n\r\nAbruptly, the bo'sun clapped me upon the shoulder, and pointed to some\r\nobject that lay out in the weed at a distance of not much less than the\r\nhalf of a mile from where we stood. Now, at first, I could not conceive\r\nwhat manner of thing it was at which I stared, until the bo'sun,\r\nremarking my bewilderment, informed me that it was a vessel all covered\r\nin, no doubt as a protection against the devil-fish and other strange\r\ncreatures in the weed. And now I began to trace the hull of her amid all\r\nthat hideous growth; but of her masts, I could discern nothing; and I\r\ndoubted not but that they had been carried away by some storm ere she was\r\ncaught by the weed; and then the thought came to me of the end of those\r\nwho had built up that protection against the horrors which the weed-world\r\nheld hidden amid its slime.\r\n\r\nPresently, I turned my gaze once more upon the island, which was very\r\nplain to see from where we stood. I conceived, now that I could see so\r\nmuch of it, that its length would be near to half a mile, though its\r\nbreadth was something under four hundred yards; thus it was very long in\r\nproportion to its width. In the middle part it had less breadth than at\r\nthe ends, being perhaps three hundred yards at its narrowest, and a\r\nhundred yards wider at its broadest.\r\n\r\nUpon both sides of the island, as I have made already a mention, there\r\nwas a beach, though this extended no great distance along the shore, the\r\nremainder being composed of the black rock of which the hills were\r\nformed. And now, having a closer regard to the beach upon the weed-side\r\nof the island, I discovered amid the wrack that had been cast ashore, a\r\nportion of the lower mast and topmast of some great ship, with rigging\r\nattached; but the yards were all gone. This find, I pointed out to the\r\nbo'sun, remarking that it might prove of use for firing; but he smiled at\r\nme, telling me that the dried weed would make a very abundant fire, and\r\nthis without going to the labor of cutting the mast into suitable logs.\r\n\r\nAnd now, he, in turn, called my attention to the place where the huge\r\nfungi had come to a stop in their growing, and I saw that in the center\r\nof the valley there was a great circular opening in the earth, like to\r\nthe mouth of a prodigious pit, and it appeared to be filled to within a\r\nfew feet of the mouth with water, over which spread a brown and horrid\r\nscum. Now, as may be supposed, I stared with some intentness at this; for\r\nit had the look of having been made with labor, being very symmetrical,\r\nyet I could not conceive but that I was deluded by the distance, and that\r\nit would have a rougher appearance when viewed from a nearer standpoint.\r\n\r\nFrom contemplating this, I looked down upon the little bay in which our\r\nboat floated. Job was sitting in the stern, sculling gently with the\r\nsteering oar and watching us. At that, I waved my hand to him in\r\nfriendly fashion, and he waved back, and then, even as I looked, I saw\r\nsomething in the water under the boat--something dark colored that was\r\nall of a-move. The boat appeared to be floating over it as over a mass\r\nof sunk weed, and then I saw that, whatever it was, it was rising to the\r\nsurface. At this a sudden horror came over me, and I clutched the bo'sun\r\nby the arm, and pointed, crying out that there was something under the\r\nboat. Now the bo'sun, so soon as he saw the thing, ran forward to the\r\nbrow of the hill and, placing his hands to his mouth after the fashion\r\nof a trumpet, sang out to the boy to bring the boat to the shore and\r\nmake fast the painter to a large piece of rock. At the bo'sun's hail,\r\nthe lad called out \"I, I,\" and, standing up, gave a sweep with his oar\r\nthat brought the boat's head round towards the beach. Fortunately for\r\nhim he was no more than some thirty yards from the shore at this time,\r\nelse he had never come to it in this life; for the next moment the\r\nmoving brown mass beneath the boat shot out a great tentacle and the oar\r\nwas torn out of Job's hands with such power as to throw him right over\r\non to the starboard gunnel of the boat. The oar itself was drawn down\r\nout of sight, and for the minute the boat was left untouched. Now the\r\nbo'sun cried out to the boy to take another oar, and get ashore while\r\nstill he had chance, and at that we all called out various things, one\r\nadvising one thing, and another recommending some other; yet our advice\r\nwas vain, for the boy moved not, at which some cried out that he was\r\nstunned. I looked now to where the brown thing had been, for the boat\r\nhad moved a few fathoms from the spot, having got some way upon her\r\nbefore the oar was snatched, and thus I discovered that the monster had\r\ndisappeared, having, I conceived, sunk again into the depths from which\r\nit had risen; yet it might re-appear at any moment, and in that case the\r\nboy would be taken before our eyes.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture, the bo'sun called to us to follow him, and led the way\r\nto the great fissure up which we had climbed, and so, in a minute, we\r\nwere, each of us, scrambling down with what haste we could make towards\r\nthe valley. And all the while as I dropped from ledge to ledge, I was\r\nfull of torment to know whether the monster had returned.\r\n\r\nThe bo'sun was the first man to reach the bottom of the cleft, and he set\r\noff immediately round the base of the rock to the beach, the rest of us\r\nfollowing him as we made safe our footing in the valley. I was the third\r\nman down; but, being light and fleet of foot, I passed the second man and\r\ncaught up with the bo'sun just as he came upon the sand. Here, I found\r\nthat the boat was within some five fathoms of the beach, and I could see\r\nJob still lying insensible; but of the monster there was no sign.\r\n\r\nAnd so matters were, the boat nearly a dozen yards from the shore, and\r\nJob lying insensible in her; with, somewhere near under her keel (for all\r\nthat we knew) a great monster, and we helpless upon the beach.\r\n\r\nNow I could not imagine how to save the lad, and indeed I fear he had\r\nbeen left to destruction--for I had deemed it madness to try to reach the\r\nboat by swimming--but for the extraordinary bravery of the bo'sun, who,\r\nwithout hesitating, dashed into the water and swam boldly out to the\r\nboat, which, by the grace of God, he reached without mishap, and climbed\r\nin over the bows. Immediately, he took the painter and hove it to us,\r\nbidding us tail on to it and bring the boat to shore without delay, and\r\nby this method of gaining the beach he showed wisdom; for in this wise he\r\nescaped attracting the attention of the monster by unneedful stirring of\r\nthe water, as he would surely have done had he made use of an oar.\r\n\r\nYet, despite his care, we had not finished with the creature; for, just\r\nas the boat grounded, I saw the lost steering oar shoot up half its\r\nlength out of the sea, and immediately there was a mighty splather in the\r\nwater astern, and the next instant the air seemed full of huge, whirling\r\narms. At that, the bo'sun gave one look behind, and, seeing the thing\r\nupon him, snatched the boy into his arms, and sprang over the bows on to\r\nthe sand. Now, at sight of the devil-fish, we had all made for the back\r\nof the beach at a run, none troubling even to retain the painter, and\r\nbecause of this, we were like to have lost the boat; for the great\r\ncuttlefish had its arms all splayed about it, seeming to have a mind to\r\ndrag it down into the deep water from whence it had risen, and it had\r\npossibly succeeded, but that the bo'sun brought us all to our senses;\r\nfor, having laid Job out of harm's way, he was the first to seize the\r\npainter, which lay trailed upon the sand, and, at that, we got back our\r\ncourage and ran to assist him.\r\n\r\nNow there happened to be convenient a great spike of rock, the same,\r\nindeed, to which the bo'sun had bidden Job tie the boat, and to this we\r\nran the painter, taking a couple of turns about it and two half-hitches,\r\nand now, unless the rope carried away, we had no reason to fear the loss\r\nof the boat; though there seemed to us to be a danger of the creature's\r\ncrushing it. Because of this, and because of a feeling of natural anger\r\nagainst the thing, the bo'sun took up from the sand one of the spears\r\nwhich had been cast down when we hauled the boat ashore. With this, he\r\nwent down so far as seemed safe, and prodded the creature in one of its\r\ntentacles--the weapon entering easily, at which I was surprised, for\r\nI had understood that these monsters were near to invulnerable in all\r\nparts save their eyes. At receiving this stab, the great fish appeared\r\nto feel no hurt for it showed no signs of pain, and, at that, the bo'sun\r\nwas further emboldened to go nearer, so that he might deliver a more\r\ndeadly wound; yet scarce had he taken two steps before the hideous thing\r\nwas upon him, and, but for an agility wonderful in so great a man, he\r\nhad been destroyed. Yet, in spite of so narrow an escape from death, he\r\nwas not the less determined to wound or destroy the creature, and, to\r\nthis end, he dispatched some of us to the grove of reeds to get half a\r\ndozen of the strongest, and when we returned with these, he bade two of\r\nthe men lash their spears securely to them, and by this means they had\r\nnow spears of a length of between thirty and forty feet. With these, it\r\nwas possible to attack the devilfish without coming within reach of its\r\ntentacles. And now being ready, he took one of the spears, telling the\r\nbiggest of the men to take the other. Then he directed him to aim for\r\nthe right eye of the huge fish whilst he would attack the left.\r\n\r\nNow since the creature had so nearly captured the bo'sun, it had ceased\r\nto tug at the boat, and lay silent, with its tentacles spread all about\r\nit, and its great eyes appearing just over the stern, so that it\r\npresented an appearance of watching our movements; though I doubt if it\r\nsaw us with any clearness; for it must have been dazed with the\r\nbrightness of the sunshine.\r\n\r\nAnd now the bo'sun gave the signal to attack, at which he and the man ran\r\ndown upon the creature with their lances, as it were in rest. The\r\nbo'sun's spear took the monster truly in its left eye; but the one\r\nwielded by the man was too bendable, and sagged so much that it struck\r\nthe stern-post of the boat, the knife blade snapping off short. Yet it\r\nmattered not; for the wound inflicted by the bo'sun's weapon was so\r\nfrightful, that the giant cuttlefish released the boat, and slid back\r\ninto deep water, churning it into foam, and gouting blood.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes we waited to make sure that the monster had indeed gone,\r\nand after that, we hastened to the boat, and drew her up so far as we\r\nwere able; after which we unloaded the heaviest of her contents, and so\r\nwere able to get her right clear of the water.\r\n\r\nAnd for an hour afterwards the sea all about the little beach was stained\r\nblack, and in places red.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nThe Noises in the Valley\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, so soon as we had gotten the boat into safety, the which we did with\r\na most feverish haste, the bo'sun gave his attention to Job; for the boy\r\nhad not yet recovered from the blow which the loom of the oar had dealt\r\nhim beneath the chin when the monster snatched at it. For awhile, his\r\nattentions produced no effect; but presently, having bathed the lad's\r\nface with water from the sea, and rubbed rum into his chest over the\r\nheart, the youth began to show signs of life, and soon opened his eyes,\r\nwhereupon the bo'sun gave him a stiff jorum of the rum, after which he\r\nasked him how he seemed in himself. To this Job replied in a weak voice\r\nthat he was dizzy and his head and neck ached badly, on hearing which,\r\nthe bo'sun bade him keep lying until he had come more to himself. And so\r\nwe left him in quietness under a little shade of canvas and reeds; for\r\nthe air was warm and the sand dry, and he was not like to come to any\r\nharm there.\r\n\r\nAt a little distance, under the directing of the bo'sun, we made to\r\nprepare dinner, for we were now very hungry, it seeming a great while\r\nsince we had broken our fast. To this end, the bo'sun sent two of the men\r\nacross the island to gather some of the dry seaweed; for we intended to\r\ncook some of the salt meat, this being the first cooked meal since ending\r\nthe meat which we had boiled before leaving the ship in the creek.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, and until the return of the men with the fuel, the\r\nbo'sun kept us busied in various ways. Two he sent to cut a bundle of the\r\nreeds, and another couple to bring the meat and the iron boiler, the\r\nlatter being one that we had taken from the old brig.\r\n\r\nPresently, the men returned with the dried seaweed, and very curious\r\nstuff it seemed, some of it being in chunks near as thick as a man's\r\nbody; but exceeding brittle by reason of its dryness. And so in a little,\r\nwe had a very good fire going, which we fed with the seaweed and pieces\r\nof the reeds, though we found the latter to be but indifferent fuel,\r\nhaving too much sap, and being troublesome to break into convenient size.\r\n\r\nNow when the fire had grown red and hot, the bo'sun half filled the\r\nboiler with sea water, in which he placed the meat; and the pan, having a\r\nstout lid, he did not scruple to place it in the very heart of the fire,\r\nso that soon we had the contents boiling merrily.\r\n\r\nHaving gotten the dinner under way, the bo'sun set about preparing our\r\ncamp for the night, which we did by making a rough framework with the\r\nreeds, over which we spread the boat's sails and the cover, pegging the\r\ncanvas down with tough splinters of the reed. When this was completed, we\r\nset-to and carried there all our stores, after which the bo'sun took us\r\nover to the other side of the island to gather fuel for the night, which\r\nwe did, each man bearing a great double armful.\r\n\r\nNow by the time that we had brought over, each of us, two loads of the\r\nfuel, we found the meat to be cooked, and so, without more to-do, set\r\nourselves down and made a very good meal off it and some biscuits, after\r\nwhich we had each of us a sound tot of the rum. Having made an end of\r\neating and drinking, the bo'sun went over to where Job lay, to inquire\r\nhow he felt, and found him lying very quiet, though his breathing had a\r\nheavy touch about it. However, we could conceive of nothing by which he\r\nmight be bettered, and so left him, being more hopeful that Nature would\r\nbring him to health than any skill of which we were possessed.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was late afternoon, so that the bo'sun declared we might\r\nplease ourselves until sunset, deeming that we had earned a very good\r\nright to rest; but that from sunset till the dawn we should, he told us,\r\nhave each of us to take turn and turn about to watch; for though we were\r\nno longer upon the water, none might say whether we were out of danger or\r\nnot, as witness the happening of the morning; though, certainly, he\r\napprehended no danger from the devil-fish so long as we kept well away\r\nfrom the water's edge.\r\n\r\nAnd so from now until dark most of the men slept; but the bo'sun spent\r\nmuch of that time in overhauling the boat, to see how it might chance to\r\nhave suffered during the storm, and also whether the struggles of the\r\ndevil-fish had strained it in any way. And, indeed, it was speedily\r\nevident that the boat would need some attention; for the plank in her\r\nbottom next but one to the keel, upon the starboard side, had been burst\r\ninwards; this having been done, it would seem, by some rock in the beach\r\nhidden just beneath the water's edge, the devil-fish having, no doubt,\r\nground the boat down upon it. Happily, the damage was not great; though\r\nit would most certainly have to be carefully repaired before the boat\r\nwould be again seaworthy. For the rest, there seemed to be no other part\r\nneeding attention.\r\n\r\nNow I had not felt any call to sleep, and so had followed the bo'sun to\r\nthe boat, giving him a hand to remove the bottom-boards, and finally to\r\nslue her bottom a little upwards, so that he might examine the leak more\r\nclosely. When he had made an end with the boat, he went over to the\r\nstores, and looked closely into their condition, and also to see how they\r\nwere lasting. And, after that, he sounded all the water-breakers; having\r\ndone which, he remarked that it would be well for us if we could discover\r\nany fresh water upon the island.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was getting on towards evening, and the bo'sun went\r\nacross to look at Job, finding him much as he had been when we visited\r\nhim after dinner. At that, the bo'sun asked me to bring across one of the\r\nlonger of the bottom-boards, which I did, and we made use of it as a\r\nstretcher to carry the lad into the tent. And afterwards, we carried all\r\nthe loose woodwork of the boat into the tent, emptying the lockers of\r\ntheir contents, which included some oakum, a small boat's hatchet, a coil\r\nof one-and-a-half-inch hemp line, a good saw, an empty colza-oil tin, a\r\nbag of copper nails, some bolts and washers, two fishing-lines, three\r\nspare tholes, a three-pronged grain without the shaft, two balls of spun\r\nyarn, three hanks of roping-twine, a piece of canvas with four\r\nroping-needles stuck in it, the boat's lamp, a spare plug, and a roll of\r\nlight duck for making boat's sails.\r\n\r\nAnd so, presently, the dark came down upon the island, at which the\r\nbo'sun waked the men, and bade them throw more fuel on to the fire, which\r\nhad burned down to a mound of glowing embers much shrouded in ash. After\r\nthat, one of them part filled the boiler with fresh water, and soon we\r\nwere occupied most pleasantly upon a supper of cold, boiled salt-meat,\r\nhard biscuits, and rum mixed with hot water. During supper, the bo'sun\r\nmade clear to the men regarding the watches, arranging how they should\r\nfollow, so that I found I was set down to take my turn from midnight\r\nuntil one of the clock. Then, he explained to them about the burst plank\r\nin the bottom of the boat, and how that it would have to be put right\r\nbefore we could hope to leave the island, and that after that night we\r\nshould have to go most strictly with the victuals; for there seemed to be\r\nnothing upon the island, that we had up till then discovered, fit to\r\nsatisfy our bellies. More than this, if we could find no fresh water, he\r\nshould have to distil some to make up for that which we had drunk, and\r\nthis must be done before leaving the island.\r\n\r\nNow by the time that the bo'sun had made an end of explaining these\r\nmatters, we had ceased from eating, and soon after this we made each one\r\nof us a comfortable place in the sand within the tent, and lay down to\r\nsleep. For a while, I found myself very wakeful, which may have been\r\nbecause of the warmth of the night, and, indeed, at last I got up and\r\nwent out of the tent, conceiving that I might the better find sleep in\r\nthe open air. And so it proved; for, having lain down at the side of the\r\ntent, a little way from the fire, I fell soon into a deep slumber, which\r\nat first was dreamless. Presently, however, I came upon a very strange\r\nand unsettling dream; for I dreamed that I had been left alone on the\r\nisland, and was sitting very desolate upon the edge of the brown-scummed\r\npit. Then I was aware suddenly that it was very dark and very silent, and\r\nI began to shiver; for it seemed to me that something which repulsed my\r\nwhole being had come quietly behind me. At that I tried mightily to turn\r\nand look into the shadows among the great fungi that stood all about me;\r\nbut I had no power to turn. And the thing was coming nearer, though never\r\na sound came to me, and I gave out a scream, or tried to; but my voice\r\nmade no stir in the rounding quiet; and then something wet and cold\r\ntouched my face, and slithered down and covered my mouth, and paused\r\nthere for a vile, breathless moment. It passed onward and fell to my\r\nthroat--and stayed there ...\r\n\r\nSome one stumbled and felt over my feet, and at that, I was suddenly\r\nawake. It was the man on watch making a walk round the back of the tent,\r\nand he had not known of my presence till he fell over my boots. He was\r\nsomewhat shaken and startled, as might be supposed; but steadied himself\r\non learning that it was no wild creature crouched there in the shadow;\r\nand all the time, as I answered his inquiries, I was full of a strange,\r\nhorrid feeling that something had left me at the moment of my awakening.\r\nThere was a slight, hateful odor in my nostrils that was not altogether\r\nunfamiliar, and then, suddenly, I was aware that my face was damp and\r\nthat there was a curious sense of tingling at my throat. I put up my hand\r\nand felt my face, and the hand when I brought it away was slippery with\r\nslime, and at that, I put up my other hand, and touched my throat, and\r\nthere it was the same, only, in addition, there was a slight swelled\r\nplace a little to one side of the wind-pipe, the sort of place that the\r\nbite of a mosquito will make; but I had no thought to blame any mosquito.\r\n\r\nNow the stumbling of the man over me, my awakening, and the discovery\r\nthat my face and throat were be-slimed, were but the happenings of some\r\nfew, short instants; and then I was upon my feet, and following him round\r\nto the fire; for I had a sense of chilliness and a great desire not to be\r\nalone. Now, having come to the fire, I took some of the water that had\r\nbeen left in the boiler, and washed my face and neck, after which I felt\r\nmore my own man. Then I asked the man to look at my throat, so that he\r\nmight give me some idea of what manner of place the swelling seemed, and\r\nhe, lighting a piece of the dry seaweed to act as a torch, made\r\nexamination of my neck; but could see little, save a number of small\r\nring-like marks, red inwardly, and white at the edges, and one of them\r\nwas bleeding slightly. After that, I asked him whether he had seen\r\nanything moving round the tent; but he had seen nothing during all the\r\ntime that he had been on watch; though it was true that he had heard odd\r\nnoises; but nothing very near at hand. Of the places on my throat he\r\nseemed to think but little, suggesting that I had been bitten by some\r\nsort of sand-fly; but at that, I shook my head, and told him of my dream,\r\nand after that, he was as anxious to keep near me as I to him. And so the\r\nnight passed onward, until my turn came to watch.\r\n\r\nFor a little while, the man whom I had relieved sat beside me; having,\r\nI conceived, the kindly intent of keeping me company; but so soon as I\r\nperceived this, I entreated him to go and get his sleep, assuring him\r\nthat I had no longer any feelings of fear--such as had been mine upon\r\nawakening and discovering the state of my face and throat--and, upon\r\nthis, he consented to leave me, and so, in a little, I sat alone\r\nbeside the fire.\r\n\r\nFor a certain space, I kept very quiet, listening; but no sound came to\r\nme out of the surrounding darkness, and so, as though it were a fresh\r\nthing, it was borne in upon me how that we were in a very abominable\r\nplace of lonesomeness and desolation. And I grew very solemn.\r\n\r\nThus as I sat, the fire, which had not been replenished for a while,\r\ndwindled steadily until it gave but a dullish glow around. And then, in\r\nthe direction of the valley, I heard suddenly the sound of a dull thud,\r\nthe noise coming to me through the stillness with a very startling\r\nclearness. At that, I perceived that I was not doing my duty to the rest,\r\nnor to myself, by sitting and allowing the fire to cease from flaming;\r\nand immediately reproaching myself, I seized and cast a mass of the dry\r\nweed upon the fire, so that a great blaze shot up into the night, and\r\nafterwards I glanced quickly to right and to left, holding my\r\ncut-and-thrust very readily, and most thankful to the Almighty that I\r\nhad brought no harm to any by reason of my carelessness, which I incline\r\nme to believe was that strange inertia which is bred by fear. And then,\r\neven as I looked about me, there came to me across the silence of the\r\nbeach a fresh noise, a continual soft slithering to and fro in the bottom\r\nof the valley, as though a multitude of creatures moved stealthily. At\r\nthis, I threw yet more fuel upon the fire, and after that I fixed my gaze\r\nin the direction of the valley: thus in the following instant it seemed\r\nto me that I saw a certain thing, as it might be a shadow, move on the\r\nouter borders of the firelight. Now the man who had kept watch before me\r\nhad left his spear stuck upright in the sand convenient to my grasp, and,\r\nseeing something moving, I seized the weapon and hurled it with all my\r\nstrength in its direction; but there came no answering cry to tell that I\r\nhad struck anything living, and immediately afterwards there fell once\r\nmore a great silence upon the island, being broken only by a far splash\r\nout upon the weed.\r\n\r\nIt may be conceived with truth that the above happenings had put a very\r\nconsiderable strain upon my nerves, so that I looked to and fro\r\ncontinually, with ever and anon a quick glance behind me; for it seemed\r\nto me that I might expect some demoniac creature to rush upon me at any\r\nmoment. Yet, for the space of many minutes, there came to me neither any\r\nsight nor sound of living creature; so that I knew not what to think,\r\nbeing near to doubting if I had heard aught beyond the common.\r\n\r\nAnd then, even as I made halt upon the threshold of doubt, I was assured\r\nthat I had not been mistaken; for, abruptly, I was aware that all the\r\nvalley was full of a rustling, scampering sort of noise, through which\r\nthere came to me occasional soft thuds, and anon the former slithering\r\nsounds. And at that, thinking a host of evil things to be upon us, I\r\ncried out to the bo'sun and the men to awake.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon my shout, the bo'sun rushed out from the tent, the men\r\nfollowing, and every one with his weapon, save the man who had left his\r\nspear in the sand, and that lay now somewhere beyond the light of the\r\nfire. Then the bo'sun shouted, to know what thing had caused me to cry\r\nout; but I replied nothing, only held up my hand for quietness, yet when\r\nthis was granted, the noises in the valley had ceased; so that the bo'sun\r\nturned to me, being in need of some explanation; but I begged him to hark\r\na little longer, which he did, and, the sounds re-commencing almost\r\nimmediately, he heard sufficient to know that I had not waked them all\r\nwithout due cause. And then, as we stood each one of us staring into the\r\ndarkness where lay the valley, I seemed to see again some shadowy thing\r\nupon the boundary of the firelight; and, in the same instant, one of the\r\nmen cried out and cast his spear into the darkness. But the bo'sun turned\r\nupon him with a very great anger; for in throwing his weapon, the man had\r\nleft himself without, and thus brought danger to the whole; yet, as will\r\nbe remembered, I had done likewise but a little since.\r\n\r\nPresently, there coming again a quietness within the valley, and none\r\nknowing what might be toward, the bo'sun caught up a mass of the dry\r\nweed, and, lighting it at the fire, ran with it towards that portion of\r\nthe beach which lay between us and the valley. Here he cast it upon the\r\nsand, singing out to some of the men to bring more of the weed, so that\r\nwe might have a fire there, and thus be able to see if anything made to\r\ncome at us out of the deepness of the hollow.\r\n\r\nPresently, we had a very good fire, and by the light of this the two\r\nspears were discovered, both of them stuck in the sand, and no more than\r\na yard one from the other, which seemed to me a very strange thing.\r\n\r\nNow, for a while after the lighting of the second fire, there came no\r\nfurther sounds from the direction of the valley; nothing indeed to break\r\nthe quietness of the island, save the occasional lonely splashes that\r\nsounded from time to time out in the vastness of the weed-continent.\r\nThen, about an hour after I had waked the bo'sun, one of the men who had\r\nbeen tending the fires came up to him to say that we had come to the end\r\nof our supply of weed-fuel. At that, the bo'sun looked very blank, the\r\nwhich did the rest of us, as well we might; yet there was no help for it,\r\nuntil one of the men bethought him of the remainder of the bundle of\r\nreeds which we had cut, and which, burning but poorly, we had discarded\r\nfor the weed. This was discovered at the back of the tent, and with it we\r\nfed the fire that burned between us and the valley; but the other we\r\nsuffered to die out, for the reeds were not sufficient to support even\r\nthe one until the dawn.\r\n\r\nAt last, and whilst it was still dark, we came to the end of our fuel,\r\nand as the fire died down, so did the noises in the valley recommence.\r\nAnd there we stood in the growing dark, each one keeping a very ready\r\nweapon, and a more ready glance. And at times the island would be\r\nmightily quiet, and then again the sounds of things crawling in the\r\nvalley. Yet, I think the silences tried us the more.\r\n\r\nAnd so at last came the dawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nWhat Happened in the Dusk\r\n\r\n\r\nNow with the coming of the dawn, a lasting silence stole across the\r\nisland and into the valley, and, conceiving that we had nothing more to\r\nfear, the bo'sun bade us get some rest, whilst he kept watch. And so I\r\ngot at last a very substantial little spell of sleep, which made me fit\r\nenough for the day's work.\r\n\r\nPresently, after some hours had passed, the bo'sun roused us to go\r\nwith him to the further side of the island to gather fuel, and soon we\r\nwere back with each a load, so that in a little we had the fire going\r\nright merrily.\r\n\r\nNow for breakfast, we had a hash of broken biscuit, salt meat and some\r\nshell-fish which the bo'sun had picked up from the beach at the foot of\r\nthe further hill; the whole being right liberally flavored with some of\r\nthe vinegar, which the bo'sun said would help keep down any scurvy that\r\nmight be threatening us. And at the end of the meal he served out to us\r\neach a little of the molasses, which we mixed with hot water, and drank.\r\n\r\nThe meal being ended, he went into the tent to take a look at Job, the\r\nwhich he had done already in the early morning; for the condition of the\r\nlad preyed somewhat upon him; he being, for all his size and\r\ntop-roughness, a man of surprisingly tender heart. Yet the boy remained\r\nmuch as on the previous evening, so that we knew not what to do with him\r\nto bring him into better health. One thing we tried, knowing that no food\r\nhad passed his lips since the previous morning, and that was to get some\r\nlittle quantity of hot water, rum and molasses down his throat; for it\r\nseemed to us he might die from very lack of food; but though we worked\r\nwith him for more than the half of an hour, we could not get him to\r\ncome-to sufficiently to take anything, and without that we had fear of\r\nsuffocating him. And so, presently, we had perforce to leave him within\r\nthe tent, and go about our business; for there was very much to be done.\r\n\r\nYet, before we did aught else, the bo'sun led us all into the valley,\r\nbeing determined to make a very thorough exploration of it, perchance\r\nthere might be any lurking beast or devil-thing waiting to rush out and\r\ndestroy us as we worked, and more, he would make search that he might\r\ndiscover what manner of creatures had disturbed our night.\r\n\r\nNow in the early morning, when we had gone for the fuel, we had kept to\r\nthe upper skirt of the valley where the rock of the nearer hill came down\r\ninto the spongy ground, but now we struck right down into the middle part\r\nof the vale, making a way amid the mighty fungi to the pit-like opening\r\nthat filled the bottom of the valley. Now though the ground was very\r\nsoft, there was in it so much of springiness that it left no trace of our\r\nsteps after we had gone on a little way, none, that is, save that in odd\r\nplaces, a wet patch followed upon our treading. Then, when we got\r\nourselves near to the pit, the ground became softer, so that our feet\r\nsank into it, and left very real impressions; and here we found tracks\r\nmost curious and bewildering; for amid the slush that edged the\r\npit--which I would mention here had less the look of a pit now that I had\r\ncome near to it--were multitudes of markings which I can liken to nothing\r\nso much as the tracks of mighty slugs amid the mud, only that they were\r\nnot altogether like to that of slugs; for there were other markings such\r\nas might have been made by bunches of eels cast down and picked up\r\ncontinually, at least, this is what they suggested to me, and I do but\r\nput it down as such.\r\n\r\nApart from the markings which I have mentioned, there was everywhere a\r\ndeal of slime, and this we traced all over the valley among the great\r\ntoadstool plants; but, beyond that which I have already remarked, we\r\nfound nothing. Nay, but I was near to forgetting, we found a quantity of\r\nthis thin slime upon those fungi which filled the end of the little\r\nvalley nearest to our encampment, and here also we discovered many of\r\nthem fresh broken or uprooted, and there was the same mark of the beast\r\nupon them all, and now I remember the dull thuds that I had heard in the\r\nnight, and made little doubt but that the creatures had climbed the great\r\ntoadstools so that they might spy us out; and it may be that many climbed\r\nupon one, so that their weight broke the fungi, or uprooted them. At\r\nleast, so the thought came to me.\r\n\r\nAnd so we made an end of our search, and after that, the bo'sun set each\r\none of us to work. But first he had us all back to the beach to give a\r\nhand to turn over the boat, so that he might get to the damaged part.\r\nNow, having the bottom of the boat full to his view, he made discovery\r\nthat there was other damage beside that of the burst plank; for the\r\nbottom plank of all had come away from the keel, which seemed to us a\r\nvery serious matter; though it did not show when the boat was upon her\r\nbilges. Yet the bo'sun assured us that he had no doubts but that she\r\ncould be made seaworthy, though it would take a greater while than\r\nhitherto he had thought needful.\r\n\r\nHaving concluded his examination of the boat, the bo'sun sent one of the\r\nmen to bring the bottom-boards out of the tent; for he needed some\r\nplanking for the repair of the damage. Yet when the boards had been\r\nbrought, he needed still something which they could not supply, and this\r\nwas a length of very sound wood of some three inches in breadth each\r\nway, which he intended to bolt against the starboard side of the keel,\r\nafter he had gotten the planking replaced so far as was possible. He had\r\nhopes that by means of this device he would be able to nail the bottom\r\nplank to this, and then caulk it with oakum, so making the boat almost\r\nso sound as ever.\r\n\r\nNow hearing him express his need for such a piece of timber, we were all\r\nadrift to know from whence such a thing could be gotten, until there came\r\nsuddenly to me a memory of the mast and topmast upon the other side of\r\nthe island, and at once I made mention of them. At that, the bo'sun\r\nnodded, saying that we might get the timber out of it, though it would be\r\na work requiring some considerable labor, in that we had only a hand-saw\r\nand a small hatchet. Then he sent us across to be getting it clear of the\r\nweed, promising to follow when he had made an end of trying to get the\r\ntwo displaced planks back into position.\r\n\r\nHaving reached the spars, we set-to with a very good will to shift away\r\nthe weed and wrack that was piled over them, and very much entangled with\r\nthe rigging. Presently we had laid them bare, and so we discovered them\r\nto be in remarkably sound condition, the lower-mast especially being a\r\nfine piece of timber. All the lower and topmast standing rigging was\r\nstill attached, though in places the lower rigging was stranded so far as\r\nhalf-way up the shrouds; yet there remained much that was good and all\r\nof it quite free from rot, and of the very finest quality of white hemp,\r\nsuch as is to be seen only in the best found vessels.\r\n\r\nAbout the time that we had finished clearing the weed, the bo'sun came\r\nover to us, bringing with him the saw and the hatchet. Under his\r\ndirections, we cut the lanyards of the topmast rigging, and after that\r\nsawed through the topmast just above the cap. Now this was a very tough\r\npiece of work, and employed us a great part of the morning, even though\r\nwe took turn and turn at the saw, and when it was done we were mightily\r\nglad that the bo'sun bade one of the men go over with some weed and make\r\nup the fire for dinner, after which he was to put on a piece of the salt\r\nmeat to boil.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the bo'sun had started to cut through the topmast,\r\nabout fifteen feet beyond the first cut, for that was the length of the\r\nbatten he required; yet so wearisome was the work, that we had not gotten\r\nmore than half through with it before the man whom the bo'sun had sent,\r\nreturned to say that the dinner was ready. When this was dispatched, and\r\nwe had rested a little over our pipes, the bo'sun rose and led us back;\r\nfor he was determined to get through with the topmast before dark.\r\n\r\nPresently, relieving each other frequently, we completed the second\r\ncut, and after that the bo'sun set us to saw a block about twelve\r\ninches deep from the remaining portion of the topmast. From this, when\r\nwe had cut it, he proceeded to hew wedges with the hatchet. Then he\r\nnotched the end of the fifteen-foot log, and into the notch he drove\r\nthe wedges, and so, towards evening, as much, maybe, by good luck as\r\ngood management, he had divided the log into two halves--the split\r\nrunning very fairly down the center.\r\n\r\nNow, perceiving how that it drew near to sundown, he bade the men haste\r\nand gather weed and carry it across to our camp; but one he sent along\r\nthe shore to make a search for shell-fish among the weed; yet he himself\r\nceased not to work at the divided log, and kept me with him as helper.\r\nThus, within the next hour, we had a length, maybe some four inches in\r\ndiameter, split off the whole length of one of the halves, and with this\r\nhe was very well content; though it seemed but a very little result for\r\nso much labor.\r\n\r\nBy this time the dusk was upon us, and the men, having made an end of\r\nweed carrying, were returned to us, and stood about, waiting for the\r\nbo'sun to go into camp. At this moment, the man the bo'sun had sent to\r\ngather shellfish, returned, and he had a great crab upon his spear, which\r\nhe had spitted through the belly. This creature could not have been less\r\nthan a foot across the back, and had a very formidable appearance; yet it\r\nproved to be a most tasty matter for our supper, when it had been placed\r\nfor a while in boiling water.\r\n\r\nNow so soon as this man was returned, we made at once for the camp,\r\ncarrying with us the piece of timber which we had hewn from the topmast.\r\nBy this time it was quite dusk, and very strange amid the great fungi as\r\nwe struck across the upper edge of the valley to the opposite beach.\r\nParticularly, I noticed that the hateful, mouldy odor of these monstrous\r\nvegetables was more offensive than I had found it to be in the daytime;\r\nthough this may be because I used my nose the more, in that I could not\r\nuse my eyes to any great extent.\r\n\r\nWe had gotten halfway across the top of the valley, and the gloom was\r\ndeepening steadily, when there stole to me upon the calmness of the\r\nevening air, a faint smell; something quite different from that of the\r\nsurrounding fungi. A moment later I got a great whiff of it, and was near\r\nsickened with the abomination of it; but the memory of that foul thing\r\nwhich had come to the side of the boat in the dawn-gloom, before we\r\ndiscovered the island, roused me to a terror beyond that of the sickness\r\nof my stomach; for, suddenly, I knew what manner of thing it was that had\r\nbeslimed my face and throat upon the previous night, and left its hideous\r\nstench lingering in my nostrils. And with the knowledge, I cried out to\r\nthe bo'sun to make haste, for there were demons with us in the valley.\r\nAnd at that, some of the men made to run; but he bade them, in a very\r\ngrim voice, stay where they were, and keep well together, else would they\r\nbe attacked and overcome, straggled all among the fungi in the dark. And\r\nthis, being, I doubt not, as much in fear of the rounding dark as of the\r\nbo'sun, they did, and so we came safely out of the valley; though there\r\nseemed to follow us a little lower down the slope an uncanny slithering.\r\n\r\nNow so soon as we reached the camp, the bo'sun ordered four fires to be\r\nlit--one on each side of the tent, and this we did, lighting them at the\r\nembers of our old fire, which we had most foolishly allowed to die down.\r\nWhen the fires had been got going, we put on the boiler, and treated the\r\ngreat crab as I have already mentioned, and so fell-to upon a very hearty\r\nsupper; but, as we ate, each man had his weapon stuck in the sand beside\r\nhim; for we had knowledge that the valley held some devilish thing, or\r\nmaybe many; though the knowing did not spoil our appetites.\r\n\r\nAnd so, presently, we came to an end of eating, whereat each man pulled\r\nout his pipe, intending to smoke; but the bo'sun told one of the men to\r\nget him upon his feet and keep watch, else might we be in danger of\r\nsurprise, with every man lolling upon the sand; and this seemed to me\r\nvery good sense; for it was easy to see that the men, too readily, deemed\r\nthemselves secure, by reason of the brightness of the fires about them.\r\n\r\nNow, whilst the men were taking their ease within the circle of the\r\nfires, the bo'sun lit one of the dips which we had out of the ship in the\r\ncreek, and went in to see how Job was, after the day's rest. At that, I\r\nrose up, reproaching myself for having forgotten the poor lad, and\r\nfollowed the bo'sun into the tent. Yet, I had but reached the opening,\r\nwhen he gave out a loud cry, and held the candle low down to the sand. At\r\nthat, I saw the reason for his agitation, for, in the place where we had\r\nleft Job, there was nothing. I stepped into the tent, and, in the same\r\ninstant, there came to my nostrils the faint odor of the horrible stench\r\nwhich had come to me in the valley, and before then from the thing that\r\ncame to the side of the boat. And, suddenly, I knew that Job had fallen\r\nprey of those foul things, and, knowing this, I called out to the bo'sun\r\nthat _they_ had taken the boy, and then my eyes caught the smear of slime\r\nupon the sand, and I had proof that I was not mistaken.\r\n\r\nNow, so soon as the bo'sun knew all that was in my mind; though indeed it\r\ndid but corroborate that which had come to his own, he came swiftly out\r\nfrom the tent, bidding the men to stand back; for they had come all about\r\nthe entrance, being very much discomposed at that which the bo'sun had\r\ndiscovered. Then the bo'sun took from a bundle of the reeds, which they\r\nhad cut at the time when he had bidden them gather fuel, several of the\r\nthickest, and to one of these he bound a great mass of the dry weed;\r\nwhereupon the men, divining his intention, did likewise with the others,\r\nand so we had each of us the wherewithal for a mighty torch.\r\n\r\nSo soon as we had completed our preparations, we took each man his weapon\r\nand, plunging our torches into the fires, set off along the track which\r\nhad been made by the devil-things and the body of poor Job; for now that\r\nwe had suspicion that harm had come to him, the marks in the sand, and\r\nthe slime, were very plain to be seen, so that it was a wonder that we\r\nhad not discovered them earlier.\r\n\r\nNow the bo'sun led the way, and, finding the marks led direct to the\r\nvalley, he broke into a run, holding his torch well above his head. At\r\nthat, each of us did likewise; for we had a great desire to be together,\r\nand further than this, I think with truth I may say, we were all fierce\r\nto avenge Job, so that we had less of fear in our hearts than otherwise\r\nhad been the case.\r\n\r\nIn less than the half of a minute we had reached the end of the valley;\r\nbut here, the ground being of a nature not happy in the revealing of\r\ntracks, we were at fault to know in which direction to continue. At that,\r\nthe bo'sun set up a loud shout to Job, perchance he might be yet alive;\r\nbut there came no answer to us, save a low and uncomfortable echo. Then\r\nthe bo'sun, desiring to waste no more time, ran straight down towards the\r\ncenter of the valley, and we followed, and kept our eyes very open about\r\nus. We had gotten perhaps halfway, when one of the men shouted that he\r\nsaw something ahead; but the bo'sun had seen it earlier; for he was\r\nrunning straight down upon it, holding his torch high and swinging his\r\ngreat cutlass. Then, instead of smiting, he fell upon his knees beside\r\nit, and the following instant we were up with him, and in that same\r\nmoment it seemed to me that I saw a number of white shapes melt swiftly\r\ninto the shadows further ahead: but I had no thought for these when I\r\nperceived that by which the bo'sun knelt; for it was the stark body of\r\nJob, and no inch of it but was covered with the little ringed marks that\r\nI had discovered upon my throat, and from every place there ran a trickle\r\nof blood, so that he was a most horrid and fearsome sight.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of Job so mangled and be-bled, there came over us the sudden\r\nquiet of a mortal terror, and in that space of silence, the bo'sun placed\r\nhis hand over the poor lad's heart; but there was no movement, though the\r\nbody was still warm. Immediately upon that, he rose to his feet, a look\r\nof vast wrath upon his great face. He plucked his torch from the ground,\r\ninto which he had plunged the haft, and stared round into the silence of\r\nthe valley; but there was no living thing in sight, nothing save the\r\ngiant fungi and the strange shadows cast by our great torches, and the\r\nloneliness.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, one of the men's torches, having burnt near out, fell all\r\nto pieces, so that he held nothing but the charred support, and\r\nimmediately two more came to a like end. Upon this, we became afraid that\r\nthey would not last us back to the camp, and we looked to the bo'sun to\r\nknow his wish; but the man was very silent, and peering everywhere into\r\nthe shadows. Then a fourth torch fell to the ground in a shower of\r\nembers, and I turned to look. In the same instant there came a great\r\nflare of light behind me, accompanied by the dull thud of a dry matter\r\nset suddenly alight. I glanced swiftly back to the bo'sun, and he was\r\nstaring up at one of the giant toadstools which was in flames all along\r\nits nearer edge, and burning with an incredible fury, sending out spirits\r\nof flame, and anon giving out sharp reports, and at each report, a fine\r\npowder was belched in thin streams; which, getting into our throats and\r\nnostrils, set us sneezing and coughing most lamentably; so that I am\r\nconvinced, had any enemy come upon us at that moment, we had been undone\r\nby reason of our uncouth helplessness.\r\n\r\nNow whether it had come to the bo'sun to set alight this first of the\r\nfungi, I know not; for it may be that his torch coming by chance against\r\nit, set it afire. However it chanced, the bo'sun took it as a veritable\r\nhint from Providence, and was already setting his torch to one a little\r\nfurther off, whilst the rest of us were near to choking with our\r\ncoughings and sneezings. Yet, that we were so suddenly overcome by the\r\npotency of the powder, I doubt if a full minute passed before we were\r\neach one busied after the manner of the bo'sun; and those whose torches\r\nhad burned out, knocked flaming pieces from the burning fungus, and with\r\nthese impaled upon their torch-sticks, did so much execution as any.\r\n\r\nAnd thus it happened that within five minutes of this discovery of Job's\r\nbody, the whole of that hideous valley sent up to heaven the reek of its\r\nburning; whilst we, filled with murderous desires, ran hither and thither\r\nwith our weapons, seeking to destroy the vile creatures that had brought\r\nthe poor lad to so unholy a death. Yet nowhere could we discover any\r\nbrute or creature upon which to ease our vengeance, and so, presently,\r\nthe valley becoming impassable by reason of the heat, the flying sparks\r\nand the abundance of the acrid dust, we made back to the body of the boy,\r\nand bore him thence to the shore.\r\n\r\nAnd during all that night no man of us slept, and the burning of the\r\nfungi sent up a mighty pillar of flame out of the valley, as out of the\r\nmouth of a monstrous pit and when the morning came it still burned. Then\r\nwhen it was daylight, some of us slept, being greatly awearied; but some\r\nkept watch.\r\n\r\nAnd when we waked there was a great wind and rain upon the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nThe Light in the Weed\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the wind was very violent from the sea, and threatened to blow down\r\nour tent, the which, indeed, it achieved at last as we made an end of a\r\ncheerless breakfast. Yet, the bo'sun bade us not trouble to put it up\r\nagain; but spread it out with the edges raised upon props made from the\r\nreeds, so that we might catch some of the rainwater; for it was become\r\nimperative that we should renew our supply before putting out again to\r\nsea. And whilst some of us were busied about this, he took the others and\r\nset up a small tent made of the spare canvas, and under this he sheltered\r\nall of our matters like to be harmed by the rain.\r\n\r\nIn a little, the rain continuing very violent, we had near a breaker-full\r\nof water collected in the canvas, and were about to run it off into one\r\nof the breakers, when the bo'sun cried out to us to hold, and first taste\r\nthe water before we mixed it with that which we had already. At that, we\r\nput down our hands and scooped up some of the water to taste, and thus we\r\ndiscovered it to be brackish and quite undrinkable, at which I was\r\namazed, until the bo'sun reminded us that the canvas had been saturated\r\nfor many days with salt water, so that it would take a great quantity of\r\nfresh before all the salt was washed out. Then he told us to lay it flat\r\nupon the beach, and scour it well on both sides with the sand, which we\r\ndid, and afterwards let the rain rinse it well, whereupon the next water\r\nthat we caught we found to be near fresh; though not sufficiently so for\r\nour purpose. Yet when we had rinsed it once more, it became clear of the\r\nsalt, so that we were able to keep all that we caught further.\r\n\r\nAnd then, something before noon, the rain ceased to fall, though coming\r\nagain at odd times in short squalls; yet the wind died not, but blew\r\nsteadily, and continued so from that quarter during the remainder of the\r\ntime that we were upon the island.\r\n\r\nUpon the ceasing of the rain, the bo'sun called us all together, that we\r\nmight make a decent burial of the unfortunate lad, whose remains had lain\r\nduring the night upon one of the bottom-boards of the boat. After a\r\nlittle discussion, it was decided to bury him in the beach; for the only\r\npart where there was soft earth was in the valley, and none of us had a\r\nstomach for that place. Moreover, the sand was soft and easy to dig, and\r\nas we had no proper tools, this was a great consideration. Presently,\r\nusing the bottom-boards and the oars and the hatchet, we had a place\r\nlarge and deep enough to hold the boy, and into this we placed him. We\r\nmade no prayer over him; but stood about the grave for a little space, in\r\nsilence. Then, the bo'sun signed to us to fill in the sand; and,\r\ntherewith, we covered up the poor lad, and left him to his sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, we made our dinner, after which the bo'sun served out to\r\neach one of us a very sound tot of the rum; for he was minded to bring us\r\nback again to a cheerful state of mind.\r\n\r\nAfter we had sat awhile, smoking, the bo'sun divided us into two\r\nparties to make a search through the island among the rocks, perchance\r\nwe should find water, collected from the rain, among the hollows and\r\ncrevasses; for though we had gotten some, through our device with the\r\nsail, yet we had by no means caught sufficient for our needs. He was\r\nespecially anxious for haste, in that the sun had come out again; for he\r\nwas feared that such small pools as we should find would be speedily\r\ndried up by its heat.\r\n\r\nNow the bo'sun headed one party, and set the big seaman over the other,\r\nbidding all to keep their weapons very handy. Then he set out to the\r\nrocks about the base of the nearer hill, sending the others to the\r\nfarther and greater one, and in each party we carried an empty breaker\r\nslung from a couple of the stout reeds, so that we might put all such\r\ndriblets as we should find, straight away into it, before they had time\r\nto vanish into the hot air; and for the purpose of bailing up the water,\r\nwe had brought with us our tin pannikins, and one of the boat's bailers.\r\n\r\nIn a while, and after much scrambling amid the rocks, we came upon a\r\nlittle pool of water that was remarkably sweet and fresh, and from this\r\nwe removed near three gallons before it became dry; and after that we\r\ncame across, maybe, five or six others; but not one of them near so big\r\nas the first; yet we were not displeased; for we had near three parts\r\nfilled the breaker, and so we made back to the camp, having some wonder\r\nas to the luck of the other party.\r\n\r\nWhen we came near the camp, we found the others returned before us, and\r\nseeming in a very high content with themselves; so that we had no need to\r\ncall to them as to whether they had filled their breaker. When they saw\r\nus, they set out to us at a run to tell us that they had come upon a\r\ngreat basin of fresh water in a deep hollow a third of the distance up\r\nthe side of the far hill, and at this the bo'sun bade us put down our\r\nbreaker and make all of us to the hill, so that he might examine for\r\nhimself whether their news was so good as it seemed.\r\n\r\nPresently, being guided by the other party, we passed around to the back\r\nof the far hill, and discovered it to go upward to the top at an easy\r\nslope, with many ledges and broken places, so that it was scarce more\r\ndifficult than a stair to climb. And so, having climbed perhaps ninety or\r\na hundred feet, we came suddenly upon the place which held the water, and\r\nfound that they had not made too much of their discovery; for the pool\r\nwas near twenty feet long by twelve broad, and so clear as though it had\r\ncome from a fountain; yet it had considerable depth, as we discovered by\r\nthrusting a spear shaft down into it.\r\n\r\nNow the bo'sun, having seen for himself how good a supply of water there\r\nwas for our needs, seemed very much relieved in his mind, and declared\r\nthat within three days at the most we might leave the island, at which we\r\nfelt none of us any regret. Indeed, had the boat escaped harm, we had\r\nbeen able to leave that same day; but this could not be; for there was\r\nmuch to be done before we had her seaworthy again.\r\n\r\nHaving waited until the bo'sun had made complete his examination, we\r\nturned to descend, thinking that this would be the bo'sun's intention;\r\nbut he called to us to stay, and, looking back, we saw that he made to\r\nfinish the ascent of the hill. At that, we hastened to follow him; though\r\nwe had no notion of his reason for going higher. Presently, we were come\r\nto the top, and here we found a very spacious place, nicely level save\r\nthat in one or two parts it was crossed by deepish cracks, maybe half a\r\nfoot to a foot wide, and perhaps three to six fathoms long; but, apart\r\nfrom these and some great boulders, it was, as I have mentioned, a\r\nspacious place; moreover it was bone dry and pleasantly firm under one's\r\nfeet, after so long upon the sand.\r\n\r\nI think, even thus early, I had some notion of the bo'sun's design; for\r\nI went to the edge that overlooked the valley, and peered down, and,\r\nfinding it nigh a sheer precipice, found myself nodding my head, as\r\nthough it were in accordance with some part formed wish. Presently,\r\nlooking about me, I discovered the bo'sun to be surveying that part which\r\nlooked over towards the weed, and I made across to join him. Here, again,\r\nI saw that the hill fell away very sheer, and after that we went across\r\nto the seaward edge, and there it was near as abrupt as on the weed side.\r\n\r\nThen, having by this time thought a little upon the matter, I put it\r\nstraight to the bo'sun that here would make indeed a very secure camping\r\nplace, with nothing to come at us upon our sides or back; and our front,\r\nwhere was the slope, could be watched with ease. And this I put to him\r\nwith great warmth; for I was mortally in dread of the coming night.\r\n\r\nNow when I had made an end of speaking, the bo'sun disclosed to me that\r\nthis was, as I had suspicion, his intent, and immediately he called to\r\nthe men that we should haste down, and ship our camp to the top of the\r\nhill. At that, the men expressed their approbation, and we made haste\r\nevery one of us to the camp, and began straightway to move our gear to\r\nthe hilltop.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, the bo'sun, taking me to assist him, set-to again upon\r\nthe boat, being intent to get his batten nicely shaped and fit to the\r\nside of the keel, so that it would bed well to the keel, but more\r\nparticularly to the plank which had sprung outward from its place. And at\r\nthis he labored the greater part of that afternoon, using the little\r\nhatchet to shape the wood, which he did with surprising skill; yet when\r\nthe evening was come, he had not brought it to his liking. But it must\r\nnot be thought that he did naught but work at the boat; for he had the\r\nmen to direct, and once he had to make his way to the top of the hill to\r\nfix the place for the tent. And after the tent was up, he set them to\r\ncarry the dry weed to the new camp, and at this he kept them until near\r\ndusk; for he had vowed never again to be without a sufficiency of fuel.\r\nBut two of the men he sent to collect shell-fish--putting two of them to\r\nthe task, because he would not have one alone upon the island, not\r\nknowing but that there might be danger, even though it were bright day;\r\nand a most happy ruling it proved; for, a little past the middle of the\r\nafternoon, we heard them shouting at the other end of the valley, and,\r\nnot knowing but that they were in need of assistance, we ran with all\r\nhaste to discover the reason of their calling, passing along the\r\nright-hand side of the blackened and sodden vale. Upon reaching the\r\nfurther beach, we saw a most incredible sight; for the two men were\r\nrunning towards us through the thick masses of the weed, while, no more\r\nthan four or five fathoms behind, they were pursued by an enormous crab.\r\nNow I had thought the crab we had tried to capture before coming to the\r\nisland, a prodigy unsurpassed; but this creature was more than treble its\r\nsize, seeming as though a prodigious table were a-chase of them, and\r\nmoreover, spite of its monstrous bulk, it made better way over the weed\r\nthan I should have conceived to be possible--running almost sideways, and\r\nwith one enormous claw raised near a dozen feet into the air.\r\n\r\nNow whether, omitting accidents, the men would have made good their\r\nescape to the firmer ground of the valley, where they could have attained\r\nto a greater speed, I do not know; but suddenly one of them tripped over\r\na loop of the weed, and the next instant lay helpless upon his face. He\r\nhad been dead the following moment, but for the pluck of his companion,\r\nwho faced round manfully upon the monster, and ran at it with his\r\ntwenty-foot spear. It seemed to me that the spear took it about a foot\r\nbelow the overhanging armor of the great back shell, and I could see\r\nthat it penetrated some distance into the creature, the man having, by\r\nthe aid of Providence, stricken it in a vulnerable part. Upon receiving\r\nthis thrust, the mighty crab ceased at once its pursuit, and clipped at\r\nthe haft of the spear with its great mandible, snapping the weapon more\r\neasily than I had done the same thing to a straw. By the time we had\r\nraced up to the men, the one who had stumbled was again upon his feet,\r\nand turning to assist his comrade; but the bo'sun snatched his spear from\r\nhim, and leapt forward himself; for the crab was making now at the other\r\nman. Now the bo'sun did not attempt to thrust the spear into the monster;\r\nbut instead he made two swift blows at the great protruding eyes, and in\r\na moment the creature had curled itself up, helpless, save that the huge\r\nclaw waved about aimlessly. At that, the bo'sun drew us off, though the\r\nman who had attacked the crab desired to make an end of it, averring that\r\nwe should get some very good eating out of it; but to this the bo'sun\r\nwould not listen, telling him that it was yet capable of very deadly\r\nmischief, did any but come within reach of its prodigious mandible.\r\n\r\nAnd after this, he bade them look no more for shellfish; but take out the\r\ntwo fishing-lines which we had, and see if they could catch aught from\r\nsome safe ledge on the further side of the hill upon which we had made\r\nour camp. Then he returned to his mending of the boat.\r\n\r\nIt was a little before the evening came down upon the island, that the\r\nbo'sun ceased work; and, after that, he called to the men, who, having\r\nmade an end of their fuel carrying, were standing near, to place the\r\nfull breakers--which we had not thought needful to carry to the new\r\ncamp on account of their weight--under the upturned boat, some holding\r\nup the gunnel whilst the others pushed them under. Then the bo'sun laid\r\nthe unfinished batten along with them, and we lowered the boat again\r\nover all, trusting to its weight to prevent any creature from meddling\r\nwith aught.\r\n\r\nAfter that, we made at once to the camp, being wearifully tired, and with\r\na hearty anticipation of supper. Upon reaching the hilltop, the men whom\r\nthe bo'sun had sent with the lines, came to show him a very fine fish,\r\nsomething like to a huge king-fish, which they had caught a few minutes\r\nearlier. This, the bo'sun, after examining, did not hesitate to pronounce\r\nfit for food; whereupon they set-to and opened and cleaned it. Now, as I\r\nhave said, it was not unlike a great king-fish, and like it, had a mouth\r\nfull of very formidable teeth; the use of which I understood the better\r\nwhen I saw the contents of its stomach, which seemed to consist of\r\nnothing but the coiled tentacles of squid or cuttlefish, with which, as I\r\nhave shown, the weed-continent swarmed. When these were upset upon the\r\nrock, I was confounded to perceive the length and thickness of some of\r\nthem; and could only conceive that this particular fish must be a very\r\ndesperate enemy to them, and able successfully to attack monsters of a\r\nbulk infinitely greater than its own.\r\n\r\nAfter this, and whilst the supper was preparing, the bo'sun called to\r\nsome of the men to put up a piece of the spare canvas upon a couple of\r\nthe reeds, so as to make a screen against the wind, which up there was\r\nso fresh that it came near at times to scattering the fire abroad. This\r\nthey found not difficult; for a little on the windward side of the fire\r\nthere ran one of the cracks of which I have made previous mention, and\r\ninto this they jammed the supports, and so in a very little time had the\r\nfire screened.\r\n\r\nPresently, the supper was ready, and I found the fish to be very fair\r\neating; though somewhat coarse; but this was no great matter for concern\r\nwith so empty a stomach as I contained. And here I would remark, that we\r\nmade our fishing save our provisions through all our stay on the island.\r\nThen, after we had come to an end of our eating, we lay down to a most\r\ncomfortable smoke; for we had no fear of attack, at that height, and with\r\nprecipices upon all sides save that which lay in front. Yet, so soon as\r\nwe had rested and smoked a while, the bo'sun set the watches; for he\r\nwould run no risk through carelessness.\r\n\r\nBy this time the night was drawing on apace; yet it was not so dark but\r\nthat one could perceive matters at a very reasonable distance. Presently,\r\nbeing in a mood that tended to thoughtfulness, and feeling a desire to be\r\nalone for a little, I strolled away from the fire to the leeward edge of\r\nthe hilltop. Here, I paced up and down awhile, smoking and meditating.\r\nAnon, I would stare out across the immensity of the vast continent of\r\nweed and slime that stretched its incredible desolation out beyond the\r\ndarkening horizon, and there would come the thought to me of the terror\r\nof men whose vessels had been entangled among its strange growths, and so\r\nmy thoughts came to the lone derelict that lay out there in the dusk, and\r\nI fell to wondering what had been the end of her people, and at that I\r\ngrew yet more solemn in my heart. For it seemed to me that they must have\r\ndied at last by starvation, and if not by that, then by the act of some\r\none of the devil-creatures which inhabited that lonely weed-world. And\r\nthen, even as I fell upon this thought, the bo'sun clapped me upon the\r\nshoulder, and told me in a very hearty way to come to the light of the\r\nfire, and banish all melancholy thoughts; for he had a very penetrating\r\ndiscernment, and had followed me quietly from the camping place, having\r\nhad reason once or twice before to chide me for gloomy meditations. And\r\nfor this, and many other matters, I had grown to like the man, the which\r\nI could almost believe at times, was his regarding of me; but his words\r\nwere too few for me to gather his feelings; though I had hope that they\r\nwere as I surmised.\r\n\r\nAnd so I came back to the fire, and presently, it not being my time to\r\nwatch until after midnight, I turned into the tent for a spell of sleep,\r\nhaving first arranged a comfortable spread of some of the softer portions\r\nof the dry weed to make me a bed.\r\n\r\nNow I was very full of sleep, so that I slept heavily, and in this wise\r\nheard not the man on watch call the bo'sun; yet the rousing of the others\r\nwaked me, and so I came to myself and found the tent empty, at which I\r\nran very hurriedly to the doorway, and so discovered that there was a\r\nclear moon in the sky, the which, by reason of the cloudiness that had\r\nprevailed, we had been without for the past two nights. Moreover, the\r\nsultriness had gone, the wind having blown it away with the clouds; yet\r\nthough, maybe, I appreciated this, it was but in a half-conscious manner;\r\nfor I was put about to discover the whereabouts of the men, and the\r\nreason of their leaving the tent. With this purpose, I stepped out from\r\nthe entrance, and the following instant discovered them all in a clump\r\nbeside the leeward edge of the hilltop. At that, I held my tongue; for I\r\nknew not but that silence might be their desire; but I ran hastily over\r\nto them, and inquired of the bo'sun what manner of thing it was which\r\ncalled them from their sleep, and he, for answer, pointed out into the\r\ngreatness of the weed-continent.\r\n\r\nAt that, I stared out over the breadth of the weed, showing very ghostly\r\nin the moonlight; but, for the moment, I saw not the thing to which he\r\npurposed to draw my attention. Then, suddenly, it fell within the circle\r\nof my gaze--a little light out in the lonesomeness. For the space of some\r\nmoments, I stared with bewildered eyes; then it came to me with\r\nabruptness that the light shone from the lone derelict lying out in the\r\nweed, the same that upon that very evening, I had looked with sorrow and\r\nawe, because of the end of those who had been in her--and now, behold, a\r\nlight burning, seemingly within one of her after cabins; though the moon\r\nwas scarce powerful enough to enable the outline of the hulk to be seen\r\nclear of the rounding wilderness.\r\n\r\nAnd from this time, until the day, we had no more sleep; but made up the\r\nfire, and sat round it, full of excitement and wonder, and getting up\r\ncontinually to discover if the light still burned. This it ceased to do\r\nabout an hour after I had first seen it; but it was the more proof that\r\nsome of our kind were no more than the half of a mile from our camp.\r\n\r\nAnd at last the day came.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nThe Signals from the Ship\r\n\r\n\r\nNow so soon as it was clearly light, we went all of us to the leeward\r\nbrow of the hill to stare upon the derelict, which now we had cause to\r\nbelieve no derelict, but an inhabited vessel. Yet though we watched her\r\nfor upwards of two hours, we could discover no sign of any living\r\ncreature, the which, indeed, had we been in cooler minds, we had not\r\nthought strange, seeing that she was all so shut in by the great\r\nsuperstructure; but we were hot to see a fellow creature, after so much\r\nlonesomeness and terror in strange lands and seas, and so could not by\r\nany means contain ourselves in patience until those aboard the hulk\r\nshould choose to discover themselves to us.\r\n\r\nAnd so, at last, being wearied with watching, we made it up together to\r\nshout when the bo'sun should give us the signal, by this means making a\r\ngood volume of sound which we conceived the wind might carry down to the\r\nvessel. Yet though we raised many shouts, making as it seemed to us a\r\nvery great noise, there came no response from the ship, and at last we\r\nwere fain to cease from our calling, and ponder some other way of\r\nbringing ourselves to the notice of those within the hulk.\r\n\r\nFor a while we talked, some proposing one thing, and some another; but\r\nnone of them seeming like to achieve our purpose. And after that we fell\r\nto marveling that the fire which we had lit in the valley had not\r\nawakened them to the fact that some of their fellow creatures were upon\r\nthe island; for, had it, we could not suppose but that they would have\r\nkept a perpetual watch upon the island until such time as they should\r\nhave been able to attract our notice. Nay! more than this, it was scarce\r\ncredible that they should not have made an answering fire, or set some of\r\ntheir bunting above the superstructure, so that our gaze should be\r\narrested upon the instant we chanced to glance towards the hulk. But so\r\nfar from this, there appeared even a purpose to shun our attention; for\r\nthat light which we had viewed in the past night was more in the way of\r\nan accident, than of the nature of a purposeful exhibition.\r\n\r\nAnd so, presently, we went to breakfast, eating heartily; our night of\r\nwakefulness having given us mighty appetites; but, for all that, we were\r\nso engrossed by the mystery of the lonesome craft, that I doubt if any of\r\nus knew what manner of food it was with which we filled our bellies. For\r\nfirst one view of the matter would be raised, and when this had been\r\ncombated, another would be broached, and in this wise it came up finally\r\nthat some of the men were falling in doubt whether the ship was inhabited\r\nby anything human, saying rather that it might be held by some demoniac\r\ncreature of the great weed-continent. At this proposition, there came\r\namong us a very uncomfortable silence; for not only did it chill the\r\nwarmth of our hopes; but seemed like to provide us with a fresh terror,\r\nwho were already acquainted with too much. Then the bo'sun spoke,\r\nlaughing with a hearty contempt at our sudden fears, and pointed out\r\nthat it was just as like that they aboard the ship had been put in fear\r\nby the great blaze from the valley, as that they should take it for a\r\nsign that fellow creatures and friends were at hand. For, as he put it to\r\nus, who of us could say what fell brutes and demons the weed-continent\r\ndid hold, and if we had reason to know that there were very dread things\r\namong the weed, how much the more must they, who had, for all that we\r\nknew, been many years beset around by such. And so, as he went on to make\r\nclear, we might suppose that they were very well aware there had come\r\nsome creatures to the island; yet, maybe, they desired not to make\r\nthemselves known until they had been given sight of them, and because of\r\nthis, we must wait until they chose to discover themselves to us.\r\n\r\nNow when the bo'sun had made an end, we felt each one of us greatly\r\ncheered; for his discourse seemed very reasonable. Yet still there were\r\nmany matters that troubled our company; for, as one put it, was it not\r\nmightily strange that we had not had previous sight of their light, or,\r\nin the day, of the smoke from their galley fire? But to this the bo'sun\r\nreplied that our camp hitherto had lain in a place where we had not\r\nsight, even of the great world of weed, leaving alone any view of the\r\nderelict. And more, that at such times as we had crossed to the opposite\r\nbeach, we had been occupied too sincerely to have much thought to watch\r\nthe hulk, which, indeed, from that position showed only her great\r\nsuperstructure. Further, that, until the preceding day, we had but once\r\nclimbed to any height; and that from our present camp the derelict could\r\nnot be viewed, and to do so, we had to go near to the leeward edge of\r\nthe hill-top.\r\n\r\nAnd so, breakfast being ended, we went all of us to see if there were yet\r\nany signs of life in the hulk; but when an hour had gone, we were no\r\nwiser. Therefore, it being folly to waste further time, the bo'sun left\r\none man to watch from the brow of the hill, charging him very strictly to\r\nkeep in such position that he could be seen by any aboard the silent\r\ncraft, and so took the rest down to assist him in the repairing of the\r\nboat. And from thence on, during the day, he gave the men a turn each at\r\nwatching, telling them to wave to him should there come any sign from the\r\nhulk. Yet, excepting the watch, he kept every man so busy as might be,\r\nsome bringing weed to keep up a fire which he had lit near the boat; one\r\nto help him turn and hold the batten upon which he labored; and two he\r\nsent across to the wreck of the mast, to detach one of the futtock\r\nshrouds, which (as is most rare) were made of iron rods. This, when they\r\nbrought it, he bade me heat in the fire, and afterwards beat out straight\r\nat one end, and when this was done, he set me to burn holes with it\r\nthrough the keel of the boat, at such places as he had marked, these\r\nbeing for the bolts with which he had determined to fasten on the batten.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, he continued to shape the batten until it was a very\r\ngood and true fit according to his liking. And all the while he cried out\r\nto this man and to that one to do this or that; and so I perceived that,\r\napart from the necessity of getting the boat into a seaworthy condition,\r\nhe was desirous to keep the men busied; for they were become so excited\r\nat the thought of fellow creatures almost within hail, that he could not\r\nhope to keep them sufficiently in hand without some matter upon which to\r\nemploy them.\r\n\r\nNow, it must not be supposed that the bo'sun had no share of our\r\nexcitement; for I noticed that he gave ever and anon a glance to the\r\ncrown of the far hill, perchance the watchman had some news for us. Yet\r\nthe morning went by, and no signal came to tell us that the people in the\r\nship had design to show themselves to the man upon watch, and so we came\r\nto dinner. At this meal, as might be supposed, we had a second\r\ndiscussion upon the strangeness of the behavior of those aboard the hulk;\r\nyet none could give any more reasonable explanation than the bo'sun had\r\ngiven in the morning, and so we left it at that.\r\n\r\nPresently, when we had smoked and rested very comfortably, for the bo'sun\r\nwas no tyrant, we rose at his bidding to descend once more to the beach.\r\nBut at this moment, one of the men having run to the edge of the hill to\r\ntake a short look at the hulk, cried out that a part of the great\r\nsuperstructure over the quarter had been removed, or pushed back, and\r\nthat there was a figure there, seeming, so far as his unaided sight could\r\ntell, to be looking through a spy-glass at the island. Now it would be\r\ndifficult to tell of all our excitement at this news, and we ran eagerly\r\nto see for ourselves if it could be as he informed us. And so it was; for\r\nwe could see the person very clearly; though remote and small because of\r\nthe distance. That he had seen us, we discovered in a moment; for he\r\nbegan suddenly to wave something, which I judged to be the spy-glass, in\r\na very wild manner, seeming also to be jumping up and down. Yet, I doubt\r\nnot but that we were as much excited; for suddenly I discovered myself to\r\nbe shouting with the rest in a most insane fashion, and more-over I was\r\nwaving my hands and running to and fro upon the brow of the hill. Then, I\r\nobserved that the figure on the hulk had disappeared; but it was for no\r\nmore than a moment, and then it was back and there were near a dozen with\r\nit, and it seemed to me that some of them were females; but the distance\r\nwas over great for surety. Now these, all of them, seeing us upon the\r\nbrow of the hill, where we must have shown up plain against the sky,\r\nbegan at once to wave in a very frantic way, and we, replying in like\r\nmanner, shouted ourselves hoarse with vain greetings. But soon we grew\r\nwearied of the unsatisfactoriness of this method of showing our\r\nexcitement, and one took a piece of the square canvas, and let it stream\r\nout into the wind, waving it to them, and another took a second piece and\r\ndid likewise, while a third man rolled up a short bit into a cone and\r\nmade use of it as a speaking trumpet; though I doubt if his voice carried\r\nany the further because of it. For my part, I had seized one of the long\r\nbamboo-like reeds which were lying about near the fire, and with this I\r\nwas making a very brave show. And so it may be seen how very great and\r\ngenuine was our exaltation upon our discovery of these poor people shut\r\noff from the world within that lonesome craft.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, it seemed to come to us to realize that _they_ were among\r\nthe weed, and _we_ upon the hilltop, and that we had no means of bridging\r\nthat which lay between. And at this we faced one another to discuss what\r\nwe should do to effect the rescue of those within the hulk. Yet it was\r\nlittle that we could even suggest; for though one spoke of how he had\r\nseen a rope cast by means of a mortar to a ship that lay off shore, yet\r\nthis helped us not, for we had no mortar; but here the same man cried out\r\nthat they in the ship might have such a thing, so that they would be able\r\nto shoot the rope to us, and at this we thought more upon his saying; for\r\nif they had such a weapon, then might our difficulties be solved. Yet we\r\nwere greatly at a loss to know how we should discover whether they were\r\npossessed of one, and further to explain our design to them. But here the\r\nbo'sun came to our help, and bade one man go quickly and char some of the\r\nreeds in the fire, and whilst this was doing he spread out upon the rock\r\none of the spare lengths of canvas; then he sung out to the man to bring\r\nhim one of the pieces of charred reed, and with this he wrote our\r\nquestion upon the canvas, calling for fresh charcoal as he required it.\r\nThen, having made an end of writing, he bade two of the men take hold of\r\nthe canvas by the ends and expose it to the view of those in the ship,\r\nand in this manner we got them to understand our desires. For, presently,\r\nsome of them went away, and came back after a little, and held up for us\r\nto see, a very great square of white, and upon it a great \"NO,\" and at\r\nthis were we again at our wits' ends to know how it would be possible to\r\nrescue those within the ship; for, suddenly, our whole desire to leave\r\nthe island, was changed into a determination to rescue the people in the\r\nhulk, and, indeed, had our intentions not been such we had been veritable\r\ncurs; though I am happy to tell that we had no thought at this juncture\r\nbut for those who were now looking to us to restore them once more to the\r\nworld to which they had been so long strangers.\r\n\r\nNow, as I have said, we were again at our wits' ends to know how to come\r\nat those within the hulk, and there we stood all of us, talking together,\r\nperchance we should hit upon some plan, and anon we would turn and wave\r\nto those who watched us so anxiously. Yet, a while passed, and we had\r\ncome no nearer to a method of rescue. Then a thought came to me (waked\r\nperchance by the mention of shooting the rope over to the hulk by means\r\nof a mortar) how that I had read once in a book, of a fair maid whose\r\nlover effected her escape from a castle by a similar artifice, only that\r\nin his case he made use of a bow in place of a mortar, and a cord instead\r\nof a rope, his sweetheart hauling up the rope by means of the cord.\r\n\r\nNow it seemed to me a possible thing to substitute a bow for the mortar,\r\nif only we could find the material with which to make such a weapon, and\r\nwith this in view, I took up one of the lengths of the bamboo-like reed,\r\nand tried the spring of it, which I found to be very good; for this\r\ncurious growth, of which I have spoken hitherto as a reed, had no\r\nresemblance to that plant, beyond its appearance; it being\r\nextraordinarily tough and woody, and having considerably more nature\r\nthan a bamboo. Now, having tried the spring of it, I went over to the\r\ntent and cut a piece of sampsonline which I found among the gear, and\r\nwith this and the reed I contrived a rough bow. Then I looked about until\r\nI came upon a very young and slender reed which had been cut with the\r\nrest, and from this I fashioned some sort of an arrow, feathering it with\r\na piece of one of the broad, stiff leaves, which grew upon the plant, and\r\nafter that I went forth to the crowd about the leeward edge of the hill.\r\nNow when they saw me thus armed, they seemed to think that I intended a\r\njest, and some of them laughed, conceiving that it was a very odd action\r\non my part; but when I explained that which was in my mind, they ceased\r\nfrom laughter, and shook their heads, making that I did but waste time;\r\nfor, as they said, nothing save gunpowder could cover so great a\r\ndistance. And after that they turned again to the bo'sun with whom some\r\nof them seemed to be in argument. And so for a little space I held my\r\npeace, and listened; thus I discovered that certain of the men advocated\r\nthe taking of the boat--so soon as it was sufficiently repaired--and\r\nmaking a passage through the weed to the ship, which they proposed to do\r\nby cutting a narrow canal. But the bo'sun shook his head, and reminded\r\nthem of the great devil-fish and crabs, and the worse things which the\r\nweed concealed, saying that those in the ship would have done it long\r\nsince had it been possible, and at that the men were silenced, being\r\nrobbed of their unreasoning ardor by his warnings.\r\n\r\nNow just at this point there happened a thing which proved the wisdom of\r\nthat which the bo'sun contended; for, suddenly, one of the men cried out\r\nto us to look, and at that we turned quickly, and saw that there was a\r\ngreat commotion among those who were in the open place in the\r\nsuperstructure; for they were running this way and that, and some were\r\npushing to the slide which filled the opening. And then, immediately, we\r\nsaw the reason for their agitation and haste; for there was a stir in the\r\nweed near to the stem of the ship, and the next instant, monstrous\r\ntentacles were reached up to the place where had been the opening; but\r\nthe door was shut, and those aboard the hulk in safety. At this\r\nmanifestation, the men about me who had proposed to make use of the boat,\r\nand the others also, cried out their horror of the vast creature, and, I\r\nam convinced, had the rescue depended upon their use of the boat, then\r\nhad those in the hulk been forever doomed.\r\n\r\nNow, conceiving that this was a good point at which to renew my\r\nimportunities, I began once again to explain the probabilities of my plan\r\nsucceeding, addressing myself more particularly to the bo'sun. I told how\r\nthat I had read that the ancients made mighty weapons, some of which\r\ncould throw a great stone so heavy as two men, over a distance surpassing\r\na quarter of a mile; moreover, that they compassed huge catapults which\r\nthrew a lance, or great arrow, even further. On this, he expressed much\r\nsurprise, never having heard of the like; but doubted greatly that we\r\nshould be able to construct such a weapon. Yet, I told him that I was\r\nprepared; for I had the plan of one clearly in my mind, and further I\r\npointed out to him that we had the wind in our favor, and that we were a\r\ngreat height up, which would allow the arrow to travel the farther before\r\nit came so low as the weed.\r\n\r\nThen I stepped to the edge of the hill, and, bidding him watch, fitted my\r\narrow to the string, and, having bent the bow, loosed it, whereupon,\r\nbeing aided by the wind and the height on which I stood, the arrow\r\nplunged into the weed at a distance of near two hundred yards from where\r\nwe stood, that being about a quarter of the distance on the road to the\r\nderelict. At that, the bo'sun was won over to my idea; though, as he\r\nremarked, the arrow had fallen nearer had it been drawing a length of\r\nyarn after it, and to this I assented; but pointed out that my bow and\r\narrow was but a rough affair, and, more, that I was no archer; yet I\r\npromised him, with the bow that I should make, to cast a shaft clean over\r\nthe hulk, did he but give me his assistance, and bid the men to help.\r\n\r\nNow, as I have come to regard it in the light of greater knowledge, my\r\npromise was exceeding rash; but I had faith in my conception, and was\r\nvery eager to put it to the test; the which, after much discussion at\r\nsupper, it was decided I should be allowed to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nThe Making of the Great Bow\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fourth night upon the island was the first to pass without incident.\r\nIt is true that a light showed from the hulk out in the weed; but now\r\nthat we had made some acquaintance with her inmates, it was no longer a\r\ncause for excitement, so much as contemplation. As for the valley where\r\nthe vile things had made an end of Job, it was very silent and desolate\r\nunder the moonlight; for I made a point to go and view it during my time\r\non watch; yet, for all that it lay empty, it was very eerie, and a place\r\nto conjure up uncomfortable thoughts, so that I spent no great time\r\npondering it.\r\n\r\nThis was the second night on which we had been free from the terror of\r\nthe devil-things, and it seemed to me that the great fire had put them in\r\nfear of us and driven them away; but of the truth or error of this idea,\r\nI was to learn later.\r\n\r\nNow it must be admitted that, apart from a short look into the valley,\r\nand occasional starings at the light out in the weed, I gave little\r\nattention to aught but my plans for the great bow, and to such use did I\r\nput my time, that when I was relieved, I had each particular and detail\r\nworked out, so that I knew very well just what to set the men doing so\r\nsoon as we should make a start in the morning.\r\n\r\nPresently, when the morning had come, and we had made an end of\r\nbreakfast, we turned-to upon the great bow, the bo'sun directing the men\r\nunder my supervision. Now, the first matter to which I bent attention,\r\nwas the raising, to the top of the hill, of the remaining half of that\r\nportion of the topmast which the bo'sun had split in twain to procure the\r\nbatten for the boat. To this end, we went down, all of us, to the beach\r\nwhere lay the wreckage, and, getting about the portion which I intended\r\nto use, carried it to the foot of the hill; then we sent a man to the top\r\nto let down the rope by which we had moored the boat to the sea anchor,\r\nand when we had bent this on securely to the piece of timber, we returned\r\nto the hill-top, and tailed on to the rope, and so, presently, after much\r\nweariful pulling, had it up.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I desired was that the split face of the timber should be\r\nrubbed straight, and this the bo'sun understood to do, and whilst he was\r\nabout it, I went with some of the men to the grove of reeds, and here,\r\nwith great care, I made a selection of some of the finest, these being\r\nfor the bow, and after that I cut some which were very clean and\r\nstraight, intending them for the great arrows. With these we returned\r\nonce more to the camp, and there I set-to and trimmed them of their\r\nleaves, keeping these latter, for I had a use for them. Then I took a\r\ndozen reeds and cut them each to a length of twenty-five feet, and\r\nafterwards notched them for the strings. In the meanwhile, I had sent\r\ntwo men down to the wreckage of the masts to cut away a couple of the\r\nhempen shrouds and bring them to the camp, and they, appearing about\r\nthis time, I set to work to unlay the shrouds, so that they might get\r\nout the fine white yarns which lay beneath the outer covering of tar\r\nand blacking. These, when they had come at them, we found to be very\r\ngood and sound, and this being so, I bid them make three-yarn sennit;\r\nmeaning it for the strings of the bows. Now, it will be observed that I\r\nhave said bows, and this I will explain. It had been my original\r\nintention to make one great bow, lashing a dozen of the reeds together\r\nfor the purpose; but this, upon pondering it, I conceived to be but a\r\npoor plan; for there would be much life and power lost in the rendering\r\nof each piece through the lashings, when the bow was released. To\r\nobviate this, and further, to compass the bending of the bow, the which\r\nhad, at first, been a source of puzzlement to me as to how it was to be\r\naccomplished, I had determined to make twelve separate bows, and these I\r\nintended to fasten at the end of the stock one above the other, so that\r\nthey were all in one plane vertically, and because of this conception, I\r\nshould be able to bend the bows one at a time, and slip each string over\r\nthe catch-notch, and afterwards frap the twelve strings together in the\r\nmiddle part so that they would be but one string to the butt of the\r\narrow. All this, I explained to the bo'sun, who, indeed, had been\r\nexercised in his own mind as to how we should be able to bend such a bow\r\nas I intended to make, and he was mightily pleased with my method of\r\nevading this difficulty, and also one other, which, else, had been\r\ngreater than the bending, and that was the _stringing_ of the bow, which\r\nwould have proved a very awkward work.\r\n\r\nPresently, the bo'sun called out to me that he had got the surface of the\r\nstock sufficiently smooth and nice; and at that I went over to him; for\r\nnow I wished him to burn a slight groove down the center, running from\r\nend to end, and this I desired to be done very exactly; for upon it\r\ndepended much of the true flight of the arrow. Then I went back to my own\r\nwork; for I had not yet finished notching the bows. Presently, when I\r\nhad made an end of this, I called for a length of the sennit, and, with\r\nthe aid of another man, contrived to string one of the bows. This, when I\r\nhad finished, I found to be very springy, and so stiff to bend that I had\r\nall that I could manage to do so, and at this I felt very satisfied.\r\n\r\nPresently, it occurred to me that I should do well to set some of the men\r\nto work upon the line which the arrow was to carry; for I had determined\r\nthat this should be made also from the white hemp yarns, and, for the\r\nsake of lightness, I conceived that one thickness of yarn would be\r\nsufficient; but so that it might compass enough of strength, I bid them\r\nsplit the yarns and lay the two halves up together, and in this manner\r\nthey made me a very light and sound line; though it must not be supposed\r\nthat it was finished at once; for I needed over half a mile of it, and\r\nthus it was later finished than the bow itself.\r\n\r\nHaving now gotten all things in train, I set me down to work upon one of\r\nthe arrows; for I was anxious to see what sort of a fist I should make of\r\nthem, knowing how much would depend upon the balance and truth of the\r\nmissile. In the end, I made a very fair one, feathering it with its own\r\nleaves, and truing and smoothing it with my knife; after which I inserted\r\na small bolt in the forrard end, to act as a head, and, as I conceived,\r\ngive it balance; though whether I was right in this latter, I am unable\r\nto say. Yet, before I had finished my arrow, the bo'sun had made the\r\ngroove, and called me over to him, that I might admire it, the which I\r\ndid; for it was done with a wonderful neatness.\r\n\r\nNow I have been so busy with my description of how we made the great bow,\r\nthat I have omitted to tell of the flight of time, and how we had eaten\r\nour dinner this long while since, and how that the people in the hulk had\r\nwaved to us, and we had returned their signals, and then written upon a\r\nlength of the canvas the one word, \"WAIT.\" And, besides all this, some\r\nhad gathered our fuel for the coming night.\r\n\r\nAnd so, presently, the evening came upon us; but we ceased not to work;\r\nfor the bo'sun bade the men to light a second great fire, beside our\r\nformer one, and by the light of this we worked another long spell;\r\nthough it seemed short enough, by reason of the interest of the work.\r\nYet, at last, the bo'sun bade us to stop and make supper, which we did,\r\nand after that, he set the watches, and the rest of us turned in; for we\r\nwere very weary.\r\n\r\nIn spite of my previous weariness, when the man whom I relieved called me\r\nto take my watch, I felt very fresh and wide awake, and spent a great\r\npart of the time, as on the preceding night, in studying over my plans\r\nfor completing the great bow, and it was then that I decided finally in\r\nwhat manner I would secure the bows athwart the end of the stock; for\r\nuntil then I had been in some little doubt, being divided between several\r\nmethods. Now, however, I concluded to make twelve grooves across the sawn\r\nend of the stock, and fit the middles of the bows into these, one above\r\nthe other, as I have already mentioned; and then to lash them at each\r\nside to bolts driven into the sides of the stock. And with this idea I\r\nwas very well pleased; for it promised to make them secure, and this\r\nwithout any great amount of work.\r\n\r\nNow, though I spent much of my watch in thinking over the details of my\r\nprodigious weapon, yet it must not be supposed that I neglected to\r\nperform my duty as watchman; for I walked continually about the top of\r\nthe hill, keeping my cut-and-thrust ready for any sudden emergency. Yet\r\nmy time passed off quietly enough; though it is true that I witnessed one\r\nthing which brought me a short spell of disquiet thought. It was in this\r\nwise:--I had come to that part of the hill-top which overhung the valley,\r\nand it came to me, abruptly, to go near to the edge and look over. Thus,\r\nthe moon being very bright, and the desolation of the valley reasonably\r\nclear to the eye, it appeared to me, as I looked that I saw a movement\r\namong certain of the fungi which had not burnt, but stood up shriveled\r\nand blackened in the valley. Yet by no means could I be sure that it was\r\nnot a sudden fancy, born of the eeriness of that desolate looking vale;\r\nthe more so as I was like to be deceived because of the uncertainty which\r\nthe light of the moon gives. Yet, to prove my doubts, I went back until I\r\nhad found a piece of rock easy to throw, and this, taking a short run, I\r\ncast into the valley, aiming at the spot where it had seemed to me that\r\nthere had been a movement. Immediately upon this, I caught a glimpse of\r\nsome moving thing, and then, more to my right, something else stirred,\r\nand at this, I looked towards it; but could discover nothing. Then,\r\nlooking back at the clump at which I had aimed my missile, I saw that the\r\nslime covered pool, which lay near, was all a-quiver, or so it seemed.\r\nYet the next instant I was just as full of doubt; for, even as I watched\r\nit, I perceived that it was quite still. And after that, for some time, I\r\nkept a very strict gaze into the valley; yet could nowhere discover aught\r\nto prove my suspicions, and, at last, I ceased from watching it; for I\r\nfeared to grow fanciful, and so wandered to that part of the hill which\r\noverlooked the weed.\r\n\r\nPresently, when I had been relieved, I returned to sleep, and so till the\r\nmorning. Then, when we had made each of us a hasty breakfast--for all\r\nwere grown mightily keen to see the great bow completed--we set-to upon\r\nit, each at our appointed task. Thus, the bo'sun and I made it our work\r\nto make the twelve grooves athwart the flat end of the stock, into which\r\nI proposed to fit and lash the bows, and this we accomplished by means of\r\nthe iron futtock-shroud, which we heated in its middle part, and then,\r\neach taking an end (protecting our hands with canvas), we went one on\r\neach side and applied the iron until at length we had the grooves burnt\r\nout very nicely and accurately. This work occupied us all the morning;\r\nfor the grooves had to be deeply burnt; and in the meantime the men had\r\ncompleted near enough sennit for the stringing of the bows; yet those who\r\nwere at work on the line which the arrow was to carry, had scarce made\r\nmore than half, so that I called off one man from the sennit to turn-to,\r\nand give them a hand with the making of the line.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was ended, the bo'sun and I set-to about fitting the bows\r\ninto their places, which we did, and lashed them to twenty-four bolts,\r\ntwelve a side, driven into the timber of the stock, about twelve inches\r\nin from the end. After this, we bent and strung the bows, taking very\r\ngreat care to have each bent exactly as the one below it; for we started\r\nat the bottom. And so, before sunset, we had that part of our work ended.\r\n\r\nNow, because the two fires which we had lit on the previous night had\r\nexhausted our fuel, the bo'sun deemed it prudent to cease work, and go\r\ndown all of us to bring up a fresh supply of the dry seaweed and some\r\nbundles of the reeds. This we did, making an end of our journeyings just\r\nas the dusk came over the island. Then, having made a second fire, as on\r\nthe preceding night, we had first our supper, and after that another\r\nspell of work, all the men turning to upon the line which the arrow was\r\nto carry, whilst the bo'sun and I set-to, each of us, upon the making of\r\na fresh arrow; for I had realized that we should have to make one or two\r\nflights before we could hope to find our range and make true our aim.\r\n\r\nLater, maybe about nine of the night, the bo'sun bade us all to put away\r\nour work, and then he set the watches, after which the rest of us went\r\ninto the tent to sleep; for the strength of the wind made the shelter a\r\nvery pleasant thing.\r\n\r\nThat night, when it came my turn to watch, I minded me to take a look\r\ninto the valley; but though I watched at intervals through the half of an\r\nhour, I saw nothing to lead me to imagine that I had indeed seen aught on\r\nthe previous night, and so I felt more confident in my mind that we\r\nshould be troubled no further by the devil-things which had destroyed\r\npoor Job. Yet I must record one thing which I saw during my watch; though\r\nthis was from the edge of the hilltop which overlooked the\r\nweed-continent, and was not in the valley, but in the stretch of clear\r\nwater which lay between the island and the weed. As I saw it, it seemed\r\nto me that a number of great fish were swimming across from the island,\r\ndiagonally towards the great continent of weed: they were swimming in one\r\nwake, and keeping a very regular line; but not breaking the water after\r\nthe manner of porpoises or black fish. Yet, though I have mentioned this,\r\nit must not be supposed that I saw any very strange thing in such a\r\nsight, and indeed, I thought nothing more of it than to wonder what sort\r\nof fish they might be; for, as I saw them indistinctly in the moonlight,\r\nthey made a queer appearance, seeming each of them to be possessed of two\r\ntails, and further, I could have thought I perceived a flicker as of\r\ntentacles just beneath the surface; but of this I was by no means sure.\r\n\r\nUpon the following morning, having hurried our breakfast, each of us\r\nset-to again upon our tasks; for we were in hopes to have the great bow\r\nat work before dinner. Soon, the bo'sun had finished his arrow, and mine\r\nwas completed very shortly after, so that there lacked nothing now to\r\nthe completion of our work, save the finishing of the line, and the\r\ngetting of the bow into position. This latter, assisted by the men, we\r\nproceeded now to effect, making a level bed of rocks near the edge of\r\nthe hill which overlooked the weed. Upon this we placed the great bow,\r\nand then, having sent the men back to their work at the line, we\r\nproceeded to the aiming of the huge weapon. Now, when we had gotten the\r\ninstrument pointed, as we conceived, straight over the hulk, the which\r\nwe accomplished by squinting along the groove which the bo'sun had burnt\r\ndown the center of the stock, we turned-to upon the arranging of the\r\nnotch and trigger, the notch being to hold the strings when the weapon\r\nwas set, and the trigger--a board bolted on loosely at the side just\r\nbelow the notch--to push them upwards out of this place when we desired\r\nto discharge the bow. This part of the work took up no great portion of\r\nour time, and soon we had all ready for our first flight. Then we\r\ncommenced to set the bows, bending the bottom one first, and then those\r\nabove in turn, until all were set; and, after that, we laid the arrow\r\nvery carefully in the groove. Then I took two pieces of spun yarn and\r\nfrapped the strings together at each end of the notch, and by this means\r\nI was assured that all the strings would act in unison when striking the\r\nbutt of the arrow. And so we had all things ready for the discharge;\r\nwhereupon, I placed my foot upon the trigger, and, bidding the bo'sun\r\nwatch carefully the flight of the arrow, pushed downwards. The next\r\ninstant, with a mighty twang, and a quiver that made the great stock\r\nstir on its bed of rocks, the bow sprang to its lesser tension, hurling\r\nthe arrow outwards and upwards in a vast arc. Now, it may be conceived\r\nwith what mortal interest we watched its flight, and so in a minute\r\ndiscovered that we had aimed too much to the right, for the arrow struck\r\nthe weed ahead of the hulk--but _beyond_ it. At that, I was filled near\r\nto bursting with pride and joy, and the men who had come forward to\r\nwitness the trial, shouted to acclaim my success, whilst the bo'sun\r\nclapped me twice upon the shoulder to signify his regard, and shouted as\r\nloud as any.\r\n\r\nAnd now it seemed to me that we had but to get the true aim, and the\r\nrescue of those in the hulk would be but a matter of another day or two;\r\nfor, having once gotten a line to the hulk, we should haul across a thin\r\nrope by its means, and with this a thicker one; after which we should set\r\nthis up so taut as possible, and then bring the people in the hulk to the\r\nisland by means of a seat and block which we should haul to and fro along\r\nthe supporting line.\r\n\r\nNow, having realized that the bow would indeed carry so far as the wreck,\r\nwe made haste to try our second arrow, and at the same time we bade the\r\nmen go back to their work upon the line; for we should have need of it in\r\na very little while. Presently, having pointed the bow more to the left,\r\nI took the frappings off the strings, so that we could bend the bows\r\nsingly, and after that we set the great weapon again. Then, seeing that\r\nthe arrow was straight in the groove, I replaced the frappings, and\r\nimmediately discharged it. This time, to my very great pleasure and\r\npride, the arrow went with a wonderful straightness towards the ship,\r\nand, clearing the superstructure, passed out of our sight as it fell\r\nbehind it. At this, I was all impatience to try to get the line to the\r\nhulk before we made our dinner; but the men had not yet laid-up\r\nsufficient; there being then only four hundred and fifty fathoms (which\r\nthe bo'sun measured off by stretching it along his arms and across his\r\nchest). This being so, we went to dinner, and made very great haste\r\nthrough it; and, after that, every one of us worked at the line, and so\r\nin about an hour we had sufficient; for I had estimated that it would not\r\nbe wise to make the attempt with a less length than five hundred fathoms.\r\n\r\nHaving now completed a sufficiency of the line, the bo'sun set one of the\r\nmen to flake it down very carefully upon the rock beside the bow, whilst\r\nhe himself tested it at all such parts as he thought in any way doubtful,\r\nand so, presently, all was ready. Then I bent it on to the arrow, and,\r\nhaving set the bow whilst the men were flaking down the line, I was\r\nprepared immediately to discharge the weapon.\r\n\r\nNow, all the morning, a man upon the hulk had observed us through a\r\nspy-glass, from a position that brought his head just above the edge of\r\nthe superstructure, and, being aware of our intentions--having watched\r\nthe previous flights--he understood the bo'sun, when he beckoned to him,\r\nthat we had made ready for a third shot, and so, with an answering wave\r\nof his spy-glass, he disappeared from our sight. At that, having first\r\nturned to see that all were clear of the line, I pressed down the\r\ntrigger, my heart beating very fast and thick, and so in a moment the\r\narrow was sped. But now, doubtless because of the weight of the line, it\r\nmade nowhere near so good a flight as on the previous occasion, the arrow\r\nstriking the weed some two hundred yards short of the hulk, and at this,\r\nI could near have wept with vexation and disappointment.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the failure of my shot, the bo'sun called to the men to\r\nhaul in the line very carefully, so that it should not be parted through\r\nthe arrow catching in the weed; then he came over to me, and proposed\r\nthat we should set-to at once to make a heavier arrow, suggesting that it\r\nhad been lack of weight in the missile which had caused it to fall short.\r\nAt that, I felt once more hopeful, and turned-to at once to prepare a new\r\narrow; the bo'sun doing likewise; though in his case he intended to make\r\na lighter one than that which had failed; for, as he put it, though the\r\nheavier one fell short, yet might the lighter succeed, and if neither,\r\nthen we could only suppose that the bow lacked power to carry the line,\r\nand in that case, we should have to try some other method.\r\n\r\nNow, in about two hours, I had made my arrow, the bo'sun having finished\r\nhis a little earlier, and so (the men having hauled in all the line and\r\nflaked it down ready) we prepared to make another attempt to cast it\r\nover the hulk. Yet, a second time we failed, and by so much that it\r\nseemed hopeless to think of success; but, for all that it appeared\r\nuseless, the bo'sun insisted on making a last try with the light arrow,\r\nand, presently, when we had gotten the line ready again, we loosed upon\r\nthe wreck; but in this case so lamentable was our failure, that I cried\r\nout to the bo'sun to set the useless thing upon the fire and burn it;\r\nfor I was sorely irked by its failure, and could scarce abide to speak\r\ncivilly of it.\r\n\r\nNow the bo'sun, perceiving how I felt, sung out that we would cease\r\ntroubling about the hulk for the present, and go down all of us to gather\r\nreeds and weed for the fire; for it was drawing nigh to evening. And this\r\nwe did, though all in a disconsolate condition of mind; for we had seemed\r\nso near to success, and now it appeared to be further than ever from us.\r\nAnd so, in a while, having brought up a sufficiency of fuel, the bo'sun\r\nsent two of the men down to one of the ledges which overhung the sea, and\r\nbade them see whether they could not secure a fish for our supper. Then,\r\ntaking our places about the fire, we fell-to upon a discussion as to how\r\nwe should come at the people in the hulk.\r\n\r\nNow, for a while there came no suggestion worthy of notice, until at last\r\nthere occurred to me a notable idea, and I called out suddenly that we\r\nshould make a small fire balloon, and float off the line to them by such\r\nmeans. At that, the men about the fire were silent a moment; for the idea\r\nwas new to them, and moreover they needed to comprehend just what I\r\nmeant. Then, when they had come fully at it, the one who had proposed\r\nthat they should make spears of their knives, cried out to know why a\r\nkite would not do, and at that I was confounded, in that so simple an\r\nexpedient had not occurred to any before; for, surely, it would be but a\r\nlittle matter to float a line to them by means of a kite, and, further,\r\nsuch a thing would take no great making.\r\n\r\nAnd so, after a space of talk, it was decided that upon the morrow we\r\nshould build some sort of kite, and with it fly a line over the hulk, the\r\nwhich should be a task of no great difficulty with so good a breeze as we\r\nhad continually with us.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, having made our supper off a very fine fish, which the\r\ntwo fishermen had caught whilst we talked, the bo'sun set the watches,\r\nand the rest turned-in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nThe Weed Men\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, on that night, when I came to my watch, I discovered that there was\r\nno moon, and, save for such light as the fire threw, the hill-top was in\r\ndarkness; yet this was no great matter to trouble me; for we had been\r\nunmolested since the burning of the fungi in the valley, and thus I had\r\nlost much of the haunting fear which had beset me upon the death of Job.\r\nYet, though I was not so much afraid as I had been, I took all\r\nprecautions that suggested themselves to me, and built up the fire to a\r\ngoodly height, after which I took my cut-and-thrust, and made the round\r\nof the camping place. At the edges of the cliffs which protected us on\r\nthree sides, I made some pause, staring down into the darkness, and\r\nlistening; though this latter was of but small use because of the\r\nstrength of the wind which roared continually in my ears. Yet though I\r\nneither saw nor heard anything, I was presently possessed of a strange\r\nuneasiness, which made me return twice or thrice to the edge of the\r\ncliffs; but always without seeing or hearing anything to justify my\r\nsuperstitions. And so, presently, being determined to give way to no\r\nfancifulness, I avoided the boundary of cliffs, and kept more to that\r\npart which commanded the slope, up and down which we made our journeys\r\nto and from the island below.\r\n\r\nThen, it would be near halfway through my time of watching, there came to\r\nme out of the immensity of weed that lay to leeward, a far distant sound\r\nthat grew upon my ear, rising and rising into a fearsome screaming and\r\nshrieking, and then dying away into the distance in queer sobs, and so at\r\nlast to a note below that of the wind's. At this, as might be supposed, I\r\nwas somewhat shaken in myself to hear so dread a noise coming out of all\r\nthat desolation, and then, suddenly, the thought came to me that the\r\nscreaming was from the ship to leeward of us, and I ran immediately to\r\nthe edge of the cliff overlooking the weed, and stared into the darkness;\r\nbut now I perceived, by a light which burned in the hulk, that the\r\nscreaming had come from some place a great distance to the right of her,\r\nand more, as my sense assured me, it could by no means have been possible\r\nfor those in her to have sent their voices to me against such a breeze as\r\nblew at that time.\r\n\r\nAnd so, for a space, I stood nervously pondering, and peering away into\r\nthe blackness of the night; thus, in a little, I perceived a dull glow\r\nupon the horizon, and, presently, there rose into view the upper edge of\r\nthe moon, and a very welcome sight it was to me; for I had been upon the\r\npoint of calling the bo'sun to inform him regarding the sound which I had\r\nheard; but I had hesitated, being afraid to seem foolish if nothing\r\nshould befall. Then, even as I stood watching the moon rise into view,\r\nthere came again to me the beginning of that screaming, somewhat like to\r\nthe sound of a woman sobbing with a giant's voice, and it grew and\r\nstrengthened until it pierced through the roar of the wind with an\r\namazing clearness, and then slowly, and seeming to echo and echo, it sank\r\naway into the distance, and there was again in my ears no sound beyond\r\nthat of the wind.\r\n\r\nAt this, having looked fixedly in the direction from which the sound had\r\nproceeded, I ran straightway to the tent and roused the bo'sun; for I had\r\nno knowledge of what the noise might portend, and this second cry had\r\nshaken from me all my bashfulness. Now the bo'sun was upon his feet\r\nalmost before I had made an end of shaking him, and catching up his great\r\ncutlass which he kept always by his side, he followed me swiftly out on\r\nto the hill-top. Here, I explained to him that I had heard a very\r\nfearsome sound which had appeared to proceed out of the vastness of the\r\nweed-continent, and that, upon a repetition of the noise, I had decided\r\nto call him; for I knew not but that it might signal to us of some coming\r\ndanger. At that, the bo'sun commended me; though chiding me in that I had\r\nhesitated to call him at the first occurrence of the crying, and then,\r\nfollowing me to the edge of the leeward cliff, he stood there with me,\r\nwaiting and listening, perchance there might come again a recurrence of\r\nthe noise.\r\n\r\nFor perhaps something over an hour we stood there very silent and\r\nlistening; but there came to us no sound beyond the continuous noise of\r\nthe wind, and so, by that time, having grown somewhat impatient of\r\nwaiting, and the moon being well risen, the bo'sun beckoned to me to make\r\nthe round of the camp with him. Now, just as I turned away, chancing to\r\nlook downward at the clear water directly below, I was amazed to see that\r\nan innumerable multitude of great fish, like unto those which I had seen\r\non the previous night, were swimming from the weed-continent towards the\r\nisland. At that, I stepped nearer the edge; for they came so directly\r\ntowards the island that I expected to see them close inshore; yet I could\r\nnot perceive one; for they seemed all of them to vanish at a point some\r\nthirty yards distant from the beach, and at that, being amazed both by\r\nthe numbers of the fish and their strangeness, and the way in which they\r\ncame on continually, yet never reached the shore, I called to the bo'sun\r\nto come and see; for he had gone on a few paces. Upon hearing my call, he\r\ncame running back; whereat I pointed into the sea below. At that, he\r\nstooped forward and peered very intently, and I with him; yet neither one\r\nof us could discover the meaning of so curious an exhibition, and so for\r\na while we watched, the bo'sun being quite so much interested as I.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, he turned away, saying that we did foolishly to stand\r\nhere peering at every curious sight, when we should be looking to the\r\nwelfare of the camp, and so we began to go the round of the hill-top.\r\nNow, whilst we had been watching and listening, we had suffered the fire\r\nto die down to a most unwise lowness, and consequently, though the moon\r\nwas rising, there was by no means the same brightness that should have\r\nmade the camp light. On perceiving this, I went forward to throw some\r\nfuel on to the fire, and then, even as I moved, it seemed to me that I\r\nsaw something stir in the shadow of the tent. And at that, I ran towards\r\nthe place, uttering a shout, and waving my cut-and-thrust; yet I found\r\nnothing, and so, feeling somewhat foolish, I turned to make up the fire,\r\nas had been my intention, and whilst I was thus busied, the bo'sun came\r\nrunning over to me to know what I had seen, and in the same instant there\r\nran three of the men out of the tent, all of them waked by my sudden cry.\r\nBut I had naught to tell them, save that my fancy had played me a trick,\r\nand had shown me something where my eyes could find nothing, and at that,\r\ntwo of the men went back to resume their sleep; but the third, the big\r\nfellow to whom the bo'sun had given the other cutlass, came with us,\r\nbringing his weapon; and, though he kept silent, it seemed to me that he\r\nhad gathered something of our uneasiness; and for my part I was not sorry\r\nto have his company.\r\n\r\nPresently, we came to that portion of the hill which overhung the\r\nvalley, and I went to the edge of the cliff, intending to peer over; for\r\nthe valley had a very unholy fascination for me. Yet, no sooner had I\r\nglanced down than I started, and ran back to the bo'sun and plucked him\r\nby the sleeve, and at that, perceiving my agitation, he came with me in\r\nsilence to see what matter had caused me so much quiet excitement. Now,\r\nwhen he looked over, he also was astounded, and drew back instantly;\r\nthen, using great caution, he bent forward once more, and stared down,\r\nand, at that, the big seaman came up behind, walking upon his toes, and\r\nstooped to see what manner of thing we had discovered. Thus we each of us\r\nstared down upon a most unearthly sight; for the valley all beneath us\r\nwas a-swarm with moving creatures, white and unwholesome in the\r\nmoonlight, and their movements were somewhat like the movements of\r\nmonstrous slugs, though the things themselves had no resemblance to such\r\nin their contours; but minded me of naked humans, very fleshy and\r\ncrawling upon their stomachs; yet their movements lacked not a surprising\r\nrapidity. And now, looking a little over the bo'sun's shoulder, I\r\ndiscovered that these hideous things were coming up out from the pit-like\r\npool in the bottom of the valley, and, suddenly, I was minded of the\r\nmultitudes of strange fish which we had seen swimming towards the island;\r\nbut which had all disappeared before reaching the shore, and I had no\r\ndoubt but that they entered the pit through some natural passage known to\r\nthem beneath the water. And now I was made to understand my thought of\r\nthe previous night, that I had seen the flicker of tentacles; for these\r\nthings below us had each two short and stumpy arms; but the ends appeared\r\ndivided into hateful and wriggling masses of small tentacles, which slid\r\nhither and thither as the creatures moved about the bottom of the valley,\r\nand at their hinder ends, where they should have grown feet, there seemed\r\nother flickering bunches; but it must not be supposed that we saw these\r\nthings clearly.\r\n\r\nNow it is scarcely possible to convey the extraordinary disgust which the\r\nsight of these human slugs bred in me; nor, could I, do I think I would;\r\nfor were I successful, then would others be like to retch even as I did,\r\nthe spasm coming on without premonition, and born of very horror. And\r\nthen, suddenly, even as I stared, sick with loathing and apprehension,\r\nthere came into view, not a fathom below my feet, a face like to the face\r\nwhich had peered up into my own on that night, as we drifted beside the\r\nweed-continent. At that, I could have screamed, had I been in less\r\nterror; for the great eyes, so big as crown pieces, the bill like to an\r\ninverted parrot's, and the slug-like undulating of its white and slimy\r\nbody, bred in me the dumbness of one mortally stricken. And, even as I\r\nstayed there, my helpless body bent and rigid, the bo'sun spat a mighty\r\ncurse into my ear, and, leaning forward, smote at the thing with his\r\ncutlass; for in the instant that I had seen it, it had advanced upward by\r\nso much as a yard. Now, at this action of the bo'sun's, I came suddenly\r\ninto possession of myself, and thrust downward with so much vigor that I\r\nwas like to have followed the brute's carcass; for I overbalanced, and\r\ndanced giddily for a moment upon the edge of eternity; and then the\r\nbo'sun had me by the waistband, and I was back in safety; but in that\r\ninstant through which I had struggled for my balance, I had discovered\r\nthat the face of the cliff was near hid with the number of the things\r\nwhich were making up to us, and I turned to the bo'sun, crying out to him\r\nthat there were thousands of them swarming up to us. Yet, he was gone\r\nalready from me, running towards the fire, and shouting to the men in the\r\ntent to haste to our help for their very lives, and then he came racing\r\nback with a great armful of the weed, and after him came the big seaman,\r\ncarrying a burning tuft from the camp fire, and so in a few moments we\r\nhad a blaze, and the men were bringing more weed; for we had a very good\r\nstock upon the hill-top; for which the Almighty be thanked.\r\n\r\nNow, scarce had we lit one fire, when the bo'sun cried out to the big\r\nseaman to make another, further along the edge of the cliff, and, in the\r\nsame instant, I shouted, and ran over to that part of the hill which lay\r\ntowards the open sea; for I had seen a number of moving things about the\r\nedge of the seaward cliff. Now here there was a deal of shadow; for there\r\nwere scattered certain large masses of rock about this part of the hill,\r\nand these held off both the light of the moon, and that from the fires.\r\nHere, I came abruptly upon three great shapes moving with stealthiness\r\ntowards the camp, and, behind these, I saw dimly that there were others.\r\nThen, with a loud cry for help, I made at the three, and, as I charged,\r\nthey rose up on end at me, and I found that they overtopped me, and their\r\nvile tentacles were reached out at me. Then I was smiting, and gasping,\r\nsick with a sudden stench, the stench of the creatures which I had come\r\nalready to know. And then something clutched at me, something slimy and\r\nvile, and great mandibles champed in my face; but I stabbed upward, and\r\nthe thing fell from me, leaving me dazed and sick, and smiting weakly.\r\nThen there came a rush of feet behind, and a sudden blaze, and the bo'sun\r\ncrying out encouragement, and, directly, he and the big seaman thrust\r\nthemselves in front of me, hurling from them great masses of burning\r\nweed, which they had borne, each of them, up a long reed. And immediately\r\nthe things were gone, slithering hastily down over the cliff edge.\r\n\r\nAnd so, presently, I was more my own man, and made to wipe from my throat\r\nthe slime left by the clutch of the monster: and afterwards I ran from\r\nfire to fire with weed, feeding them, and so a space passed, during\r\nwhich we had safety; for by that time we had fires all about the top of\r\nthe hill, and the monsters were in mortal dread of fire, else had we been\r\ndead, all of us, that night.\r\n\r\nNow, a while before the dawn, we discovered, for the second time since we\r\nhad been upon the island, that our fuel could not last us the night at\r\nthe rate at which we were compelled to burn it, and so the bo'sun told\r\nthe men to let out every second fire, and thus we staved off for a while\r\nthe time when we should have to face a spell of darkness, and the things\r\nwhich, at present, the fires held off from us. And so at last, we came to\r\nthe end of the weed and the reeds, and the bo'sun called out to us to\r\nwatch the cliff edges very carefully, and smite on the instant that any\r\nthing showed; but that, should he call, all were to gather by the central\r\nfire for a last stand. And, after that, he blasted the moon which had\r\npassed behind a great bank of cloud. And thus matters were, and the gloom\r\ndeepened as the fires sank lower and lower. Then I heard a man curse, on\r\nthat part of the hill which lay towards the weed-continent, his cry\r\ncoming up to me against the wind, and the bo'sun shouted to us to all\r\nhave a care, and directly afterwards I smote at something that rose\r\nsilently above the edge of the cliff opposite to where I watched.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a minute passed, and then there came shouts from all parts of the\r\nhilltop, and I knew that the weed men were upon us, and in the same\r\ninstant there came two above the edge near me, rising with a ghostly\r\nquietness, yet moving lithely. Now the first, I pierced somewhere in the\r\nthroat, and it fell backward; but the second, though I thrust it through,\r\ncaught my blade with a bunch of its tentacles, and was like to have\r\nsnatched it from me; but that I kicked it in the face, and at that,\r\nbeing, I believe, more astonished than hurt, it loosed my sword, and\r\nimmediately fell away out of sight. Now this had taken, in all, no more\r\nthan some ten seconds; yet already I perceived so many as four others\r\ncoming into view a little to my right, and at that it seemed to me that\r\nour deaths must be very near, for I knew not how we were to cope with the\r\ncreatures, coming as they were so boldly and with such rapidity. Yet, I\r\nhesitated not, but ran at them, and now I thrust not; but cut at their\r\nfaces, and found this to be very effectual; for in this wise disposed I\r\nof three in as many strokes; but the fourth had come right over the cliff\r\nedge, and rose up at me upon its hinder parts, as had done those others\r\nwhen the bo'sun had succored me. At that, I gave way, having a very\r\nlively dread; but, hearing all about me the cries of conflict, and\r\nknowing that I could expect no help, I made at the brute: then as it\r\nstooped and reached out one of its bunches of tentacles, I sprang back,\r\nand slashed at them, and immediately I followed this up by a thrust in\r\nthe stomach, and at that it collapsed into a writhing white ball, that\r\nrolled this way and that, and so, in its agony, coming to the edge of the\r\ncliff, it fell over, and I was left, sick and near helpless with the\r\nhateful stench of the brutes.\r\n\r\nNow by this time all the fires about the edges of the hill were sunken\r\ninto dull glowing mounds of embers; though that which burnt near to the\r\nentrance of the tent was still of a good brightness; yet this helped us\r\nbut little, for we fought too far beyond the immediate circle of its\r\nbeams to have benefit of it. And still the moon, at which now I threw a\r\ndespairing glance, was no more than a ghostly shape behind the great bank\r\nof cloud which was passing over it. Then, even as I looked upward,\r\nglancing as it might be over my left shoulder, I saw, with a sudden\r\nhorror, that something had come anigh me, and upon the instant, I caught\r\nthe reek of the thing, and leapt fearfully to one side, turning as I\r\nsprang. Thus was I saved in the very moment of my destruction; for the\r\ncreature's tentacles smeared the back of my neck as I leapt, and then I\r\nhad smitten, once and again, and conquered.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this, I discovered something to be crossing the dark\r\nspace that lay between the dull mound of the nearest fire, and that which\r\nlay further along the hill-top, and so, wasting no moment of time, I ran\r\ntowards the thing, and cut it twice across the head before ever it could\r\nget upon its hind parts, in which position I had learned greatly to dread\r\nthem. Yet, no sooner had I slain this one, than there came a rush of\r\nmaybe a dozen upon me; these having climbed silently over the cliff edge\r\nin the meanwhile. At this, I dodged, and ran madly towards the glowing\r\nmound of the nearest fire, the brutes following me almost so quick as I\r\ncould run; but I came to the fire the first, and then, a sudden thought\r\ncoming to me, I thrust the point of my cut-and-thrust among the embers\r\nand switched a great shower of them at the creatures, and at that I had a\r\nmomentary clear vision of many white, hideous faces stretched out towards\r\nme, and brown, champing mandibles which had the upper beak shutting into\r\nthe lower; and the clumped, wriggling tentacles were all a-flutter. Then\r\nthe gloom came again; but immediately, I switched another and yet another\r\nshower of the burning embers towards them, and so, directly, I saw them\r\ngive back, and then they were gone. At this, all about the edges of the\r\nhilltop, I saw the fires being scattered in like manner; for others had\r\nadopted this device to help them in their sore straits.\r\n\r\nFor a little after this, I had a short breathing space, the brutes\r\nseeming to have taken fright; yet I was full of trembling, and I glanced\r\nhither and thither, not knowing when some one or more of them would come\r\nupon me. And ever I glanced towards the moon, and prayed the Almighty\r\nthat the clouds would pass quickly, else should we be all dead men; and\r\nthen, as I prayed, there rose a sudden very terrible scream from one of\r\nthe men, and in the same moment there came something over the edge of the\r\ncliff fronting me; but I cleft it or ever it could rise higher, and in my\r\nears there echoed still the sudden scream which had come from that part\r\nof the hill which lay to the left of me: yet I dared not to leave my\r\nstation; for to have done so would have been to have risked all, and so I\r\nstayed, tortured by the strain of ignorance, and my own terror.\r\n\r\nAgain, I had a little spell in which I was free from molestation; nothing\r\ncoming into sight so far as I could see to right or left of me; though\r\nothers were less fortunate, as the curses and sounds of blows told to me,\r\nand then, abruptly, there came another cry of pain, and I looked up again\r\nto the moon, and prayed aloud that it might come out to show some light\r\nbefore we were all destroyed; but it remained hid. Then a sudden thought\r\ncame into my brain, and I shouted at the top of my voice to the bo'sun to\r\nset the great cross-bow upon the central fire; for thus we should have a\r\nbig blaze--the wood being very nice and dry. Twice I shouted to him,\r\nsaying:--\"Burn the bow! Burn the bow!\" And immediately he replied,\r\nshouting to all the men to run to him and carry it to the fire; and this\r\nwe did and bore it to the center fire, and then ran back with all speed\r\nto our places. Thus in a minute we had some light, and the light grew as\r\nthe fire took hold of the great log, the wind fanning it to a blaze. And\r\nso I faced outwards, looking to see if any vile face showed above the\r\nedge before me, or to my right or left. Yet, I saw nothing, save, as it\r\nseemed to me, once a fluttering tentacle came up, a little to my right;\r\nbut nothing else for a space.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was near five minutes later, that there came another attack,\r\nand, in this, I came near to losing my life, through my folly in\r\nventuring too near to the edge of the cliff; for, suddenly, there shot up\r\nout from the darkness below, a clump of tentacles, and caught me about\r\nthe left ankle, and immediately I was pulled to a sitting posture, so\r\nthat both my feet were over the edge of the precipice, and it was only by\r\nthe mercy of God that I had not plunged head foremost into the valley.\r\nYet, as it was, I suffered a mighty peril; for the brute that had my\r\nfoot, put a vast strain upon it, trying to pull me down; but I resisted,\r\nusing my hands and seat to sustain me, and so, discovering that it could\r\nnot compass my end in this wise, it slacked somewhat of the stress, and\r\nbit at my boot, shearing through the hard leather, and nigh destroying my\r\nsmall toe; but now, being no longer compelled to use both hands to retain\r\nmy position, I slashed down with great fury, being maddened by the pain\r\nand the mortal fear which the creature had put upon me; yet I was not\r\nimmediately free of the brute; for it caught my sword blade; but I\r\nsnatched it away before it could take a proper hold, mayhaps cutting its\r\nfeelers somewhat thereby; though of this I cannot be sure, for they\r\nseemed not to grip around a thing, but to _suck_ to it; then, in a\r\nmoment, by a lucky blow, I maimed it, so that it loosed me, and I was\r\nable to get back into some condition of security.\r\n\r\nAnd from this onwards, we were free from molestation; though we had no\r\nknowledge but that the quietness of the weed men did but portend a\r\nfresh attack, and so, at last, it came to the dawn; and in all this\r\ntime the moon came not to our help, being quite hid by the clouds which\r\nnow covered the whole arc of the sky, making the dawn of a very\r\ndesolate aspect.\r\n\r\nAnd so soon as there was a sufficiency of light, we examined the valley;\r\nbut there were nowhere any of the weed men, no! nor even any of their\r\ndead for it seemed that they had carried off all such and their wounded,\r\nand so we had no opportunity to make an examination of the monsters by\r\ndaylight. Yet, though we could not come upon their dead, all about the\r\nedges of the cliffs was blood and slime, and from the latter there came\r\never the hideous stench which marked the brutes; but from this we\r\nsuffered little, the wind carrying it far away to leeward, and filling\r\nour lungs with sweet and wholesome air.\r\n\r\nPresently, seeing that the danger was past, the bo'sun called us to the\r\ncenter fire, on which burnt still the remnants of the great bow, and here\r\nwe discovered for the first time that one of the men was gone from us. At\r\nthat, we made search about the hilltop, and afterwards in the valley and\r\nabout the island; but found him not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nIn Communication\r\n\r\n\r\nNow of the search which we made through the valley for the body of\r\nTompkins, that being the name of the lost man, I have some doleful\r\nmemories. But first, before we left the camp, the bo'sun gave us all a\r\nvery sound tot of the rum, and also a biscuit apiece, and thereafter we\r\nhasted down, each man holding his weapon readily. Presently, when we were\r\ncome to the beach which ended the valley upon the seaward side, the\r\nbo'sun led us along to the bottom of the hill, where the precipices came\r\ndown into the softer stuff which covered the valley, and here we made a\r\ncareful search, perchance he had fallen over, and lay dead or wounded\r\nnear to our hands. But it was not so, and after that, we went down to the\r\nmouth of the great pit, and here we discovered the mud all about it to be\r\ncovered with multitudes of tracks, and in addition to these and the\r\nslime, we found many traces of blood; but nowhere any signs of Tompkins.\r\nAnd so, having searched all the valley, we came out upon the weed which\r\nstrewed the shore nearer to the great weed-continent; but discovered\r\nnothing until we had made up towards the foot of the hill, where it came\r\ndown sheer into the sea. Here, I climbed on to a ledge--the same from\r\nwhich the men had caught their fish--, thinking that, if Tompkins had\r\nfallen from above, he might lie in the water at the foot of the cliff,\r\nwhich was here, maybe, some ten to twenty feet deep; but, for a little\r\nspace, I saw nothing. Then, suddenly, I discovered that there was\r\nsomething white, down in the sea away to my left, and, at that, I climbed\r\nfarther out along the ledge.\r\n\r\nIn this wise I perceived that the thing which had attracted my notice was\r\nthe dead body of one of the weed men. I could see it but dimly, catching\r\nodd glimpses of it as the surface of the water smoothed at whiles. It\r\nappeared to me to be lying curled up, and somewhat upon its right side,\r\nand in proof that it was dead, I saw a mighty wound that had come near to\r\nshearing away the head; and so, after a further glance, I came in, and\r\ntold what I had seen. At that, being convinced by this time that Tompkins\r\nwas indeed done to death, we ceased our search; but first, before we left\r\nthe spot, the bo'sun climbed out to get a sight of the dead weed man and\r\nafter him the rest of the men, for they were greatly curious to see\r\nclearly what manner of creature it was that had attacked us in the night.\r\nPresently, having seen so much of the brute as the water would allow,\r\nthey came in again to the beach, and afterwards were returned to the\r\nopposite side of the island, and so, being there, we crossed over to the\r\nboat, to see whether it had been harmed; but found it to be untouched.\r\nYet, that the creatures had been all about it, we could perceive by the\r\nmarks of slime upon the sand, and also by the strange trail which they\r\nhad left in the soft surface. Then one of the men called out that there\r\nhad been something at Job's grave, which, as will be remembered, had been\r\nmade in the sand some little distance from the place of our first camp.\r\nAt that, we looked all of us, and it was easy to see that it had been\r\ndisturbed, and so we ran hastily to it, knowing not what to fear; thus\r\nwe found it to be empty; for the monsters had digged down to the poor\r\nlad's body, and of it we could discover no sign. Upon this, we came to a\r\ngreater horror of the weed men than ever; for we knew them now to be foul\r\nghouls who could not let even the dead body rest in the grave.\r\n\r\nNow after this, the bo'sun led us all back to the hill-top, and there he\r\nlooked to our hurts; for one man had lost two fingers in the night's\r\nfray; another had been bitten savagely in the left arm; whilst a third\r\nhad all the skin of his face raised in wheals where one of the brutes had\r\nfixed its tentacles. And all of these had received but scant attention,\r\nbecause of the stress of the fight, and, after that, through the\r\ndiscovery that Tompkins was missing. Now, however, the bo'sun set-to upon\r\nthem, washing and binding them up, and for dressings he made use of some\r\nof the oakum which we had with us, binding this on with strips torn from\r\nthe roll of spare duck, which had been in the locker of the boat.\r\n\r\nFor my part, seizing this chance to make some examination of my\r\nwounded toe, the which, indeed, was causing me to limp, I found that I\r\nhad endured less harm than seemed to me; for the bone of the toe was\r\nuntouched, though showing bare; yet when it was cleansed, I had not\r\novermuch pain with it; though I could not suffer to have the boot on,\r\nand so bound some canvas about my foot, until such time as it should\r\nbe healed.\r\n\r\nPresently, when our wounds were all attended to, the which had taken\r\ntime, for there was none of us altogether untouched, the bo'sun bade the\r\nman whose fingers were damaged, to lie down in the tent, and the same\r\norder he gave also to him that was bitten in the arm. Then, the rest of\r\nus he directed to go down with him and carry up fuel; for that the night\r\nhad shown him how our very lives depended upon a sufficiency of this;\r\nand so all that morning we brought fuel to the hill-top, both weed and\r\nreeds, resting not until midday, when he gave us a further tot of the\r\nrum, and after that set one of the men upon the dinner. Then he bade the\r\nman, Jessop by name, who had proposed to fly a kite over the vessel in\r\nthe weed, to say whether he had any craft in the making of such a\r\nmatter. At that, the fellow laughed, and told the bo'sun that he would\r\nmake him a kite that would fly very steadily and strongly, and this\r\nwithout the aid of a tail. And so the bo'sun bade him set-to without\r\ndelay, for that we should do well to deliver the people in the hulk, and\r\nafterwards make all haste from the island, which was no better than a\r\nnesting place of ghouls.\r\n\r\nNow hearing the man say that his kite would fly without a tail, I was\r\nmightily curious to see what manner of thing he would make; for I had\r\nnever seen the like, nor heard that such was possible. Yet he spoke of no\r\nmore than he could accomplish; for he took two of the reeds and cut them\r\nto a length of about six feet; then he bound them together in the middle\r\nso that they formed a Saint Andrew's cross, and after that he made two\r\nmore such crosses, and when these were completed, he took four reeds\r\nmaybe a dozen feet long, and bade us stand them upright in the shape of a\r\nsquare, so that they formed the four corners, and after that he took one\r\nof the crosses, and laid it in the square so that its four ends touched\r\nthe four uprights, and in this position he lashed it. Then he took the\r\nsecond cross and lashed it midway between the top and bottom of the\r\nuprights, and after that he lashed the third at the top, so that the\r\nthree of them acted as spreaders to keep the four longer reeds in their\r\nplaces as though they were for the uprights of a little square tower.\r\nNow, when he had gotten so far as that, the bo'sun called out to us to\r\nmake our dinners, and this we did, and afterwards had a short time in\r\nwhich to smoke, and whilst we were thus at our ease the sun came out,\r\nthe which it had not done all the day, and at that we felt vastly\r\nbrighter; for the day had been very gloomy with clouds until that time,\r\nand what with the loss of Tompkins, and our own fears and hurts, we had\r\nbeen exceeding doleful, but now, as I have said, we became more cheerful,\r\nand went very alertly to the finishing of the kite.\r\n\r\nAt this point it came suddenly to the bo'sun that we had made no\r\nprovision of cord for the flying of the kite, and he called out to the\r\nman to know what strength the kite would require, at which Jessop\r\nanswered him that maybe ten-yarn sennit would do, and this being so,\r\nthe bo'sun led three of us down to the wrecked mast upon the further\r\nbeach, and from this we stripped all that was left of the shrouds, and\r\ncarried them to the top of the hill, and so, presently, having unlaid\r\nthem, we set-to upon the sennit, using ten yarns; but plaiting two as\r\none, by which means we progressed with more speed than if we had taken\r\nthem singly.\r\n\r\nNow, as we worked, I glanced occasionally towards Jessop, and saw that he\r\nstitched a band of the light duck around each end of the framework which\r\nhe had made, and these bands I judged to be about four feet wide, in this\r\nwise leaving an open space between the two, so that now the thing looked\r\nsomething like to a Punchinello show, only that the opening was in the\r\nwrong place, and there was too much of it. After that he bent on a bridle\r\nto two of the uprights, making this of a piece of good hemp rope which he\r\nfound in the tent, and then he called out to the bo'sun that the kite was\r\nfinished. At that, the bo'sun went over to examine it, the which did all\r\nof us; for none of us had seen the like of such a thing, and, if I\r\nmisdoubt not, few of us had much faith that it would fly; for it seemed\r\nso big and unwieldy. Now, I think that Jessop gathered something of our\r\nthoughts; for, calling to one of us to hold the kite, lest it should\r\nblow away, he went into the tent, and brought out the remainder of the\r\nhemp line, the same from which he had cut the bridle. This, he bent on to\r\nit, and, giving the end into our hands, bade us go back with it until all\r\nthe slack was taken up, he, in the meanwhile, steadying the kite. Then,\r\nwhen we had gone back to the extent of the line, he shouted to us to take\r\na very particular hold upon it, and then, stooping, caught the kite by\r\nthe bottom, and threw it into the air, whereupon, to our amazement,\r\nhaving swooped somewhat to one side, it steadied and mounted upwards into\r\nthe sky like a very bird.\r\n\r\nNow at this, as I have made mention, we were astonished, for it appeared\r\nlike a miracle to us to see so cumbrous a thing fly with so much grace\r\nand persistence, and further, we were mightily surprised at the manner in\r\nwhich it pulled upon the rope, tugging with such heartiness that we were\r\nlike to have loosed it in our first astonishment, had it not been for the\r\nwarning which Jessop called to us.\r\n\r\nAnd now, being well assured of the properness of the kite, the bo'sun\r\nbade us to draw it in, the which we did only with difficulty, because of\r\nits bigness and the strength of the breeze. And when we had it back again\r\nupon the hilltop, Jessop moored it very securely to a great piece of\r\nrock, and, after that, having received our approbation, he turned-to with\r\nus upon the making of the sennit.\r\n\r\nPresently, the evening drawing near, the bo'sun set us to the building of\r\nfires about the hill-top, and after that, having waved our goodnights to\r\nthe people in the hulk, we made our suppers, and lay down to smoke, after\r\nwhich, we turned-to again at our plaiting of the sennit, the which we\r\nwere in very great haste to have done. And so, later, the dark having\r\ncome down upon the island, the bo'sun bade us take burning weed from the\r\ncenter fire, and set light to the heaps of weed that we had stacked\r\nround the edges of the hill for that purpose, and so in a few minutes the\r\nwhole of the hill-top was very light and cheerful, and afterwards, having\r\nput two of the men to keep watch and attend to the fires, he sent the\r\nrest of us back to our sennit making, keeping us at it until maybe about\r\nten of the clock, after which he arranged that two men at a time should\r\nbe on watch throughout the night, and then he bade the rest of us\r\nturn-in, so soon as he had looked to our various hurts.\r\n\r\nNow, when it came to my turn to watch, I discovered that I had been\r\nchosen to accompany the big seaman, at which I was by no means\r\ndispleased; for he was a most excellent fellow, and moreover a very lusty\r\nman to have near, should anything come upon one unawares. Yet, we were\r\nhappy in that the night passed off without trouble of any sort, and so at\r\nlast came the morning.\r\n\r\nSo soon as we had made our breakfast, the bo'sun took us all down to the\r\ncarrying of fuel; for he saw very clearly that upon a good supply of this\r\ndepended our immunity from attack. And so for the half of the morning we\r\nworked at the gathering of weed and reeds for our fires. Then, when we\r\nhad obtained a sufficiency for the coming night, he set us all to work\r\nagain upon the sennit, and so until dinner, after which we turned-to once\r\nmore upon our plaiting. Yet it was plain that it would take several days\r\nto make a sufficient line for our purpose, and because of this, the\r\nbo'sun cast about in his mind for some way in which he could quicken its\r\nproduction. Presently, as a result of some little thought, he brought out\r\nfrom the tent the long piece of hemp rope with which we had moored the\r\nboat to the sea anchor, and proceeded to unlay it, until he had all three\r\nstrands separate. Then he bent the three together, and so had a very\r\nrough line of maybe some hundred and eighty fathoms in length, yet,\r\nthough so rough, he judged it strong enough, and thus we had this much\r\nthe less sennit to make.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, we made our dinner, and after that for the rest of the\r\nday we kept very steadily to our plaiting, and so, with the previous\r\nday's work, had near two hundred fathoms completed by the time that the\r\nbo'sun called us to cease and come to supper. Thus it will be seen that\r\ncounting all, including the piece of hemp line from which the bridle had\r\nbeen made, we may be said to have had at this time about four hundred\r\nfathoms towards the length which we needed for our purpose, this having\r\nbeen reckoned at five hundred fathoms.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, having lit all the fires, we continued to work at the\r\nplaiting, and so, until the bo'sun set the watches, after which we\r\nsettled down for the night, first, however, letting the bo'sun see to\r\nour hurts. Now this night, like to the previous, brought us no trouble;\r\nand when the day came, we had first our breakfast, and then set-to upon\r\nour collecting of fuel, after which we spent the rest of the day at the\r\nsennit, having manufactured a sufficiency by the evening, the which the\r\nbo'sun celebrated by a very rousing tot of the rum. Then, having made\r\nour supper, we lit the fires, and had a very comfortable evening, after\r\nwhich, as on the preceding nights, having let the bo'sun attend our\r\nwounds, we settled for the night, and on this occasion the bo'sun let\r\nthe man who had lost his fingers, and the one who had been bitten so\r\nbadly in the arm, take their first turn at the watching since the night\r\nof the attack.\r\n\r\nNow when the morning came we were all of us very eager to come to the\r\nflying of the kite; for it seemed possible to us that we might effect\r\nthe rescue of the people in the hulk before the evening. And, at the\r\nthought of this, we experienced a very pleasurable sense of excitement;\r\nyet, before the bo'sun would let us touch the kite, he insisted that we\r\nshould gather our usual supply of fuel, the which order, though full of\r\nwisdom, irked us exceedingly, because of our eagerness to set about the\r\nrescue. But at last this was accomplished, and we made to get the line\r\nready, testing the knots, and seeing that it was all clear for running.\r\nYet, before setting the kite off, the bo'sun took us down to the further\r\nbeach to bring up the foot of the royal and t'gallant mast, which\r\nremained fast to the topmast, and when we had this upon the hill-top, he\r\nset its ends upon two rocks, after which he piled a heap of great pieces\r\naround them, leaving the middle part clear. Round this he passed the\r\nkite line a couple or three times, and then gave the end to Jessop to\r\nbend on to the bridle of the kite, and so he had all ready for paying\r\nout to the wreck.\r\n\r\nAnd now, having nothing to do, we gathered round to watch, and,\r\nimmediately, the bo'sun giving the signal, Jessop cast the kite into\r\nthe air, and, the wind catching it, lifted it strongly and well, so\r\nthat the bo'sun could scarce pay out fast enough. Now, before the kite\r\nhad been let go, Jessop had bent to the forward end of it a great\r\nlength of the spun yarn, so that those in the wreck could catch it as\r\nit trailed over them, and, being eager to witness whether they would\r\nsecure it without trouble, we ran all of us to the edge of the hill to\r\nwatch. Thus, within five minutes from the time of the loosing of the\r\nkite, we saw the people in the ship wave to us to cease veering, and\r\nimmediately afterwards the kite came swiftly downwards, by which we\r\nknew that they had the tripping-line, and were hauling upon it, and at\r\nthat we gave out a great cheer, and afterwards we sat about and smoked,\r\nwaiting until they had read our instructions, which we had written upon\r\nthe covering of the kite.\r\n\r\nPresently, maybe the half of an hour afterwards, they signaled to us to\r\nhaul upon our line, which we proceeded to do without delay, and so,\r\nafter a great space, we had hauled in all of our rough line, and come\r\nupon the end of theirs, which proved to be a fine piece of three-inch\r\nhemp, new and very good; yet we could not conceive that this would stand\r\nthe stress necessary to lift so great a length clear of the weed, as\r\nwould be needful, or ever we could hope to bring the people of the ship\r\nover it in safety. And so we waited some little while, and, presently,\r\nthey signaled again to us to haul, which we did, and found that they had\r\nbent on a much greater rope to the bight of the three-inch hemp, having\r\nmerely intended the latter for a hauling-line by which to get the heavier\r\nrope across the weed to the island. Thus, after a weariful time of\r\npulling, we got the end of the bigger rope up to the hill-top, and\r\ndiscovered it to be an extraordinarily sound rope of some four inches\r\ndiameter, and smoothly laid of fine yarns round and very true and well\r\nspun, and with this we had every reason to be satisfied.\r\n\r\nNow to the end of the big rope they had tied a letter, in a bag of\r\noilskin, and in it they said some very warm and grateful things to us,\r\nafter which they set out a short code of signals by which we should be\r\nable to understand one another on certain general matters, and at the end\r\nthey asked if they should send us any provision ashore; for, as they\r\nexplained, it would take some little while to get the rope set taut\r\nenough for our purpose, and the carrier fixed and in working order. Now,\r\nupon reading this letter, we called out to the bo'sun that he should ask\r\nthem if they would send us some soft bread; the which he added thereto a\r\nrequest for lint and bandages and ointment for our hurts. And this he\r\nbade me write upon one of the great leaves from off the reeds, and at the\r\nend he told me to ask if they desired us to send them any fresh water.\r\nAnd all of this, I wrote with a sharpened splinter of reed, cutting the\r\nwords into the surface of the leaf. Then, when I had made an end of\r\nwriting, I gave the leaf to the bo'sun, and he enclosed it in the oilskin\r\nbag, after which he gave the signal for those in the hulk to haul on the\r\nsmaller line, and this they did.\r\n\r\nPresently, they signed to us to pull in again, the which we did, and so,\r\nwhen we had hauled in a great length of their line, we came to the little\r\noilskin bag, in which we found lint and bandages and ointment, and a\r\nfurther letter, which set out that they were baking bread, and would send\r\nus some so soon as it was out from the oven.\r\n\r\nNow, in addition to the matters for the healing of our wounds, and the\r\nletter, they had included a bundle of paper in loose sheets, some quills\r\nand an inkhorn, and at the end of their epistle, they begged very\r\nearnestly of us to send them some news of the outer world; for they had\r\nbeen shut up in that strange continent of weed for something over seven\r\nyears. They told us then that there were twelve of them in the hulk,\r\nthree of them being women, one of whom had been the captain's wife; but\r\nhe had died soon after the vessel became entangled in the weed, and along\r\nwith him more than half of the ship's company, having been attacked by\r\ngiant devil-fish, as they were attempting to free the vessel from the\r\nweed, and afterwards they who were left had built the superstructure as a\r\nprotection against the devil-fish, and the _devil-men_, as they termed\r\nthem; for, until it had been built, there had been no safety about the\r\ndecks, neither day nor night.\r\n\r\nTo our question as to whether they were in need of water, the people in\r\nthe ship replied that they had a sufficiency, and, further, that they\r\nwere very well supplied with provisions; for the ship had sailed from\r\nLondon with a general cargo, among which there was a vast quantity of\r\nfood in various shapes and forms. At this news we were greatly pleased,\r\nseeing that we need have no more anxiety regarding a lack of victuals,\r\nand so in the letter which I went into the tent to write, I put down\r\nthat we were in no great plentitude of provisions, at which hint I\r\nguessed they would add somewhat to the bread when it should be ready. And\r\nafter that I wrote down such chief events as my memory recalled as having\r\noccurred in the course of the past seven years, and then, a short account\r\nof our own adventures, up to that time, telling them of the attack which\r\nwe had suffered from the weed men, and asking such questions as my\r\ncuriosity and wonder prompted.\r\n\r\nNow whilst I had been writing, sitting in the mouth of the tent, I had\r\nobserved, from time to time, how that the bo'sun was busied with the men\r\nin passing the end of the big rope round a mighty boulder, which lay\r\nabout ten fathoms in from the edge of the cliff which overlooked the\r\nhulk. This he did, parceling the rope where the rock was in any way\r\nsharp, so as to protect it from being cut; for which purpose he made use\r\nof some of the canvas. And by the time that I had the letter completed,\r\nthe rope was made very secure to the great piece of rock, and, further,\r\nthey had put a large piece of chafing gear under that part of the rope\r\nwhere it took the edge of the cliff.\r\n\r\nNow having, as I have said, completed the letter, I went out with it to\r\nthe bo'sun; but, before placing it in the oilskin bag he bade me add a\r\nnote at the bottom, to say that the big rope was all fast, and that they\r\ncould heave on it so soon as it pleased them, and after that we\r\ndispatched the letter by means of the small line, the men in the hulk\r\nhauling it off to them so soon as they perceived our signals.\r\n\r\nBy this, it had come well on to the latter part of the afternoon, and the\r\nbo'sun called us to make some sort of a meal, leaving one man to watch\r\nthe hulk, perchance they should signal to us. For we had missed our\r\ndinner in the excitement of the day's work, and were come now to feel the\r\nlack of it. Then, in the midst of it, the man upon the lookout cried out\r\nthat they were signaling to us from the ship, and, at that, we ran all of\r\nus to see what they desired, and so, by the code which we had arranged\r\nbetween us, we found that they waited for us to haul upon the small line.\r\nThis did we, and made out presently that we were hauling something across\r\nthe weed, of a very fair bulk, at which we warmed to our work, guessing\r\nthat it was the bread which they had promised us, and so it proved, and\r\ndone up with great neatness in a long roll of tarpaulin, which had been\r\nwrapped around both the loaves and the rope, and lashed very securely at\r\nthe ends, thus producing a taper shape convenient for passing over the\r\nweed without catching. Now, when we came to open this parcel, we\r\ndiscovered that my hint had taken very sound effect; for there were in\r\nthe parcel, besides the loaves, a boiled ham, a Dutch cheese, two bottles\r\nof port well padded from breakage, and four pounds of tobacco in plugs.\r\nAnd at this coming of good things, we stood all of us upon the edge of\r\nthe hill, and waved our thanks to those in the ship, they waving back in\r\nall good will, and after that we went back to our meal, at which we\r\nsampled the new victuals with very lusty appetites.\r\n\r\nThere was in the parcel, one other matter, a letter, most neatly\r\nindited, as had been the former epistles, in a feminine handwriting, so\r\nthat I guessed they had one of the women to be their scribe. This\r\nepistle answered some of my queries, and, in particular, I remember that\r\nit informed me as to the probable cause of the strange crying which\r\npreceded the attack by the weed men, saying that on each occasion when\r\nthey in the ship had suffered their attacks, there had been always this\r\nsame crying, being evidently a summoning call or signal to the attack,\r\nthough how given, the writer had not discovered; for the weed\r\n_devils_--this being how they in the ship spoke always of them--made\r\nnever a sound when attacking, not even when wounded to the death, and,\r\nindeed, I may say here, that we never learnt the way in which that\r\nlonesome sobbing was produced, nor, indeed, did they, or we, discover\r\nmore than the merest tithe of the mysteries which that great continent\r\nof weed holds in its silence.\r\n\r\nAnother matter to which I had referred was the consistent blowing of the\r\nwind from one quarter, and this the writer told me happened for as much\r\nas six months in the year, keeping up a very steady strength. A further\r\nthing there was which gave me much interest; it was that the ship had not\r\nbeen always where we had discovered her; for at one time they had been so\r\nfar within the weed, that they could scarce discern the open sea upon the\r\nfar horizon; but that at times the weed opened in great gulfs that went\r\nyawning through the continent for scores of miles, and in this way the\r\nshape and coasts of the weed were being constantly altered; these\r\nhappenings being for the most part at the change of the wind.\r\n\r\nAnd much more there was that they told us then and afterwards, how that\r\nthey dried weed for their fuel, and how the rains, which fell with great\r\nheaviness at certain periods, supplied them with fresh water; though, at\r\ntimes, running short, they had learnt to distil sufficient for their\r\nneeds until the next rains.\r\n\r\nNow, near to the end of the epistle, there came some news of their\r\npresent actions, and thus we learnt that they in the ship were busy at\r\nstaying the stump of the mizzen-mast, this being the one to which they\r\nproposed to attach the big rope, taking it through a great iron-bound\r\nsnatch-block, secured to the head of the stump, and then down to the\r\nmizzen-capstan, by which, and a strong tackle, they would be able to\r\nheave the line so taut as was needful.\r\n\r\nNow, having finished our meal, the bo'sun took out the lint, bandages and\r\nointment, which they had sent us from the hulk, and proceeded to dress\r\nour hurts, beginning with him who had lost his fingers, which, happily,\r\nwere making a very healthy heal. And afterwards we went all of us to the\r\nedge of the cliff, and sent back the look-out to fill such crevices in\r\nhis stomach as remained yet empty; for we had passed him already some\r\nsound hunks of the bread and ham and cheese, to eat whilst he kept watch,\r\nand so he had suffered no great harm.\r\n\r\nIt may have been near an hour after this, that the bo'sun pointed out to\r\nme that they in the ship had commenced to heave upon the great rope, and\r\nso I perceived, and stood watching it; for I knew that the bo'sun had\r\nsome anxiety as to whether it would take-up sufficiently clear of the\r\nweed to allow those in the ship to be hauled along it, free from\r\nmolestation by the great devil-fish.\r\n\r\nPresently, as the evening began to draw on, the bo'sun bade us go and\r\nbuild our fires about the hilltop, and this we did, after which we\r\nreturned to learn how the rope was lifting, and now we perceived that it\r\nhad come clear of the weed, at which we felt mightily rejoiced, and waved\r\nencouragement, chance there might be any who watched us from the hulk.\r\nYet, though the rope was up clear of the weed, the bight of it had to\r\nrise to a much greater height, or ever it would do for the purpose for\r\nwhich we intended it, and already it suffered a vast strain, as I\r\ndiscovered by placing my hand upon it; for, even to lift the slack of so\r\ngreat a length of line meant the stress of some tons. And later I saw\r\nthat the bo'sun was growing anxious; for he went over to the rock around\r\nwhich he had made fast the rope, and examined the knots, and those places\r\nwhere he had parceled it, and after that he walked to the place where it\r\nwent over the edge of the cliff, and here he made a further scrutiny; but\r\ncame back presently, seeming not dissatisfied.\r\n\r\nThen, in a while, the darkness came down upon us, and we lighted our\r\nfires and prepared for the night, having the watches arranged as on the\r\npreceding nights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nAboard the Hulk\r\n\r\n\r\nNow when it came to my watch, the which I took in company with the big\r\nseaman, the moon had not yet risen, and all the island was vastly dark,\r\nsave the hill-top, from which the fires blazed in a score of places, and\r\nvery busy they kept us, supplying them with fuel. Then, when maybe the\r\nhalf of our watch had passed, the big seaman, who had been to feed the\r\nfires upon the weed side of the hill-top, came across to me, and bade me\r\ncome and put my hand upon the lesser rope; for that he thought they in\r\nthe ship were anxious to haul it in so that they might send some message\r\nacross to us. At his words, I asked him very anxiously whether he had\r\nperceived them waving a light, the which we had arranged to be our method\r\nof signaling in the night, in the event of such being needful; but, to\r\nthis, he said that he had seen naught; and, by now, having come near the\r\nedge of the cliff, I could see for myself, and so perceived that there\r\nwas none signaling to us from the hulk. Yet, to please the fellow, I put\r\nmy hand upon the line, which we had made fast in the evening to a large\r\npiece of rock, and so, immediately, I discovered that something was\r\npulling upon it, hauling and then slackening, so that it occurred to me\r\nthat the people in the vessel might be indeed wishful to send us some\r\nmessage, and at that, to make sure, I ran to the nearest fire, and,\r\nlighting a tuft of weed, waved it thrice; but there came not any\r\nanswering signal from those in the ship, and at that I went back to feel\r\nat the rope, to assure myself that it had not been the pluck of the wind\r\nupon it; but I found that it was something very different from the wind,\r\nsomething that plucked with all the sharpness of a hooked fish, only that\r\nit had been a mighty great fish to have given such tugs, and so I knew\r\nthat some vile thing out in the darkness of the weed was fast to the\r\nrope, and at this there came the fear that it might break it, and then a\r\nsecond thought that something might be climbing up to us along the rope,\r\nand so I bade the big seaman stand ready with his great cutlass, whilst I\r\nran and waked the bo'sun. And this I did, and explained to him how that\r\nsomething meddled with the lesser rope, so that he came immediately to\r\nsee for himself how this might be, and when he had put his hand upon it,\r\nhe bade me go and call the rest of the men, and let them stand round by\r\nthe fires; for that there was something abroad in the night, and we might\r\nbe in danger of attack; but he and the big seaman stayed by the end of\r\nthe rope, watching, so far as the darkness would allow, and ever and anon\r\nfeeling the tension upon it.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, it came to the bo'sun to look to the second line, and he\r\nran, cursing himself for his thoughtlessness; but because of its greater\r\nweight and tension, he could not discover for certain whether anything\r\nmeddled with it or not; yet he stayed by it, arguing that if aught\r\ntouched the smaller rope then might something do likewise with the\r\ngreater, only that the small line lay along the weed, whilst the greater\r\none had been some feet above it when the darkness had fallen over us, and\r\nso might be free from any prowling creatures.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, maybe, an hour passed, and we kept watch and tended the fires,\r\ngoing from one to another, and, presently, coming to that one which was\r\nnearest to the bo'sun, I went over to him, intending to pass a few\r\nminutes in talk; but as I drew nigh to him, I chanced to place my hand\r\nupon the big rope, and at that I exclaimed in surprise; for it had become\r\nmuch slacker than when last I had felt it in the evening, and I asked the\r\nbo'sun whether he had noticed it, whereat he felt the rope, and was\r\nalmost more amazed than I had been; for when last he had touched it, it\r\nhad been taut, and humming in the wind. Now, upon this discovery, he was\r\nin much fear that something had bitten through it, and called to the men\r\nto come all of them and pull upon the rope, so that he might discover\r\nwhether it was indeed parted; but when they came and hauled upon it, they\r\nwere unable to gather in any of it, whereat we felt all of us mightily\r\nrelieved in our minds; though still unable to come at the cause of its\r\nsudden slackness.\r\n\r\nAnd so, a while later, there rose the moon, and we were able to examine\r\nthe island and the water between it and the weed-continent, to see\r\nwhether there was anything stirring; yet neither in the valley, nor on\r\nthe faces of the cliffs, nor in the open water could we perceive aught\r\nliving, and as for anything among the weed, it was small use trying to\r\ndiscover it among all that shaggy blackness. And now, being assured that\r\nnothing was coming at us, and that, so far as our eyes could pierce,\r\nthere climbed nothing upon the ropes, the bo'sun bade us get turned-in,\r\nall except those whose time it was to watch. Yet, before I went into the\r\ntent, I made a careful examination of the big rope, the which did also\r\nthe bo'sun, but could perceive no cause for its slackness; though this\r\nwas quite apparent in the moonlight, the rope going down with greater\r\nabruptness than it had done in the evening. And so we could but conceive\r\nthat they in the hulk had slacked it for some reason; and after that we\r\nwent to the tent and a further spell of sleep.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning we were waked by one of the watchmen, coming into\r\nthe tent to call the bo'sun; for it appeared that the hulk had moved in\r\nthe night, so that its stern was now pointed somewhat towards the island.\r\nAt this news, we ran all of us from the tent to the edge of the hill, and\r\nfound it to be indeed as the man had said, and now I understood the\r\nreason of that sudden slackening of the rope; for, after withstanding the\r\nstress upon it for some hours, the vessel had at last yielded, and slewed\r\nits stern towards us, moving also to some extent bodily in our direction.\r\n\r\nAnd now we discovered that a man in the look-out place in the top of the\r\nstructure was waving a welcome to us, at which we waved back, and then\r\nthe bo'sun bade me haste and write a note to know whether it seemed to\r\nthem likely that they might be able to heave the ship clear of the weed,\r\nand this I did, greatly excited within myself at this new thought, as,\r\nindeed, was the bo'sun himself and the rest of the men. For could they do\r\nthis, then how easily solved were every problem of coming to our own\r\ncountry. But it seemed too good a thing to have come true, and yet I\r\ncould but hope. And so, when my letter was completed, we put it up in the\r\nlittle oilskin bag, and signaled to those in the ship to haul in upon the\r\nline. Yet, when they went to haul, there came a mighty splather amid the\r\nweed, and they seemed unable to gather in any of the slack, and then,\r\nafter a certain pause, I saw the man in the look-out point something, and\r\nimmediately afterwards there belched out in front of him a little puff of\r\nsmoke, and, presently, I caught the report of a musket, so that I knew\r\nthat he was firing at something in the weed. He fired again, and yet once\r\nmore, and after that they were able to haul in upon the line, and so I\r\nperceived that his fire had proved effectual; yet we had no knowledge of\r\nthe thing at which he had discharged his weapon.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, they signaled to us to draw back the line, the which we\r\ncould do only with great difficulty, and then the man in the top of the\r\nsuper-structure signed to us to vast hauling, which we did, whereupon he\r\nbegan to fire again into the weed; though with what effect we could not\r\nperceive. Then, in a while he signaled to us to haul again, and now the\r\nrope came more easily; yet still with much labor, and a commotion in the\r\nweed over which it lay and, in places, sank. And so, at last, as it\r\ncleared the weed because of the lift of the cliff, we saw that a great\r\ncrab had clutched it, and that we hauled it towards us; for the creature\r\nhad too much obstinacy to let go.\r\n\r\nPerceiving this, and fearing that the great claws of the crab might\r\ndivide the rope, the bo'sun caught up one of the men's lances, and ran to\r\nthe cliff edge, calling to us to pull in gently, and put no more strain\r\nupon the line than need be. And so, hauling with great steadiness, we\r\nbrought the monster near to the edge of the hill, and there, at a wave\r\nfrom the bo'sun, stayed our pulling. Then he raised the spear, and smote\r\nat the creature's eyes, as he had done on a previous occasion, and\r\nimmediately it loosed its hold, and fell with a mighty splash into the\r\nwater at the foot of the cliff. Then the bo'sun bade us haul in the rest\r\nof the rope, until we should come to the packet, and, in the meantime, he\r\nexamined the line to see whether it had suffered harm through the\r\nmandibles of the crab; yet, beyond a little chafe, it was quite sound.\r\n\r\nAnd so we came to the letter, which I opened and read, finding it to be\r\nwritten in the same feminine hand which had indited the others. From it\r\nwe gathered that the ship had burst through a very thick mass of the weed\r\nwhich had compacted itself about her, and that the second mate, who was\r\nthe only officer remaining to them, thought there might be good chance\r\nto heave the vessel out; though it would have to be done with great\r\nslowness, so as to allow the weed to part gradually, otherwise the ship\r\nwould but act as a gigantic rake to gather up weed before it, and so form\r\nits own barrier to clear water. And after this there were kind wishes and\r\nhopes that we had spent a good night, the which I took to be prompted by\r\nthe feminine heart of the writer, and after that I fell to wondering\r\nwhether it was the captain's wife who acted as scribe. Then I was waked\r\nfrom my pondering, by one of the men crying out that they in the ship had\r\ncommenced to heave again upon the big rope, and, for a time, I stood and\r\nwatched it rise slowly, as it came to tautness.\r\n\r\nI had stood there awhile, watching the rope, when, suddenly, there came a\r\ncommotion amid the weed, about two-thirds of the way to the ship, and now\r\nI saw that the rope had freed itself from the weed, and clutching it,\r\nwere, maybe, a score of giant crabs. At this sight, some of the men cried\r\nout their astonishment, and then we saw that there had come a number of\r\nmen into the look-out place in the top of the superstructure, and,\r\nimmediately, they opened a very brisk fire upon the creatures, and so, by\r\nones and twos they fell back into the weed, and after that, the men in\r\nthe hulk resumed their heaving, and so, in a while, had the rope some\r\nfeet clear of the surface.\r\n\r\nNow, having tautened the rope so much as they thought proper, they left\r\nit to have its due effect upon the ship, and proceeded to attach a great\r\nblock to it; then they signaled to us to slack away on the little rope\r\nuntil they had the middle part of it, and this they hitched around the\r\nneck of the block, and to the eye in the strop of the block they attached\r\na bo'sun's chair, and so they had ready a carrier, and by this means we\r\nwere able to haul stuff to and from the hulk without having to drag it\r\nacross the surface of the weed; being, indeed, the fashion in which we\r\nhad intended to haul ashore the people in the ship. But now we had the\r\nbigger project of salvaging the ship herself, and, further, the big rope,\r\nwhich acted as support for the carrier, was not yet of a sufficient\r\nheight above the weed-continent for it to be safe to attempt to bring any\r\nashore by such means; and now that we had hopes of saving the ship, we\r\ndid not intend to risk parting the big rope, by trying to attain such a\r\ndegree of tautness as would have been necessary at this time to have\r\nraised its bight to the desired height.\r\n\r\nNow, presently, the bo'sun called out to one of the men to make\r\nbreakfast, and when it was ready we came to it, leaving the man with the\r\nwounded arm to keep watch; then when we had made an end, he sent him,\r\nthat had lost his fingers, to keep a look-out whilst the other came to\r\nthe fire and ate his breakfast. And in the meanwhile, the bo'sun took us\r\ndown to collect weed and reeds for the night, and so we spent the greater\r\npart of the morning, and when we had made an end of this, we returned to\r\nthe top of the hill, to discover how matters were going forward; thus we\r\nfound, from the one at the look-out, that they, in the hulk, had been\r\nobliged to heave twice upon the big rope to keep it off the weed, and by\r\nthis we knew that the ship was indeed making a slow sternway towards the\r\nisland--slipping steadily through the weed, and as we looked at her, it\r\nseemed almost that we could perceive that she was nearer; but this was no\r\nmore than imagination; for, at most, she could not have moved more than\r\nsome odd fathoms. Yet it cheered us greatly, so that we waved our\r\ncongratulations to the man who stood in the lookout in the\r\nsuperstructure, and he waved back.\r\n\r\nLater, we made dinner, and afterwards had a very comfortable smoke, and\r\nthen the bo'sun attended to our various hurts. And so through the\r\nafternoon we sat about upon the crest of the hill overlooking the\r\nhulk, and thrice had they in the ship to heave upon the big rope, and\r\nby evening they had made near thirty fathoms towards the island, the\r\nwhich they told us in reply to a query which the bo'sun desired me to\r\nsend them, several messages having passed between us in the course of\r\nthe afternoon, so that we had the carrier upon our side. Further than\r\nthis, they explained that they would tend the rope during the night, so\r\nthat the strain would be kept up, and, more, this would keep the ropes\r\noff the weed.\r\n\r\nAnd so, the night coming down upon us, the bo'sun bade us light the fires\r\nabout the top of the hill, the same having been laid earlier in the day,\r\nand thus, our supper having been dispatched, we prepared for the night.\r\nAnd all through it there burned lights aboard the hulk, the which proved\r\nvery companionable to us in our times of watching; and so, at last came\r\nthe morning, the darkness having passed without event. And now, to our\r\nhuge pleasure, we discovered that the ship had made great progress in the\r\nnight; being now so much nearer that none could suppose it a matter of\r\nimagination; for she must have moved nigh sixty fathoms nearer to the\r\nisland, so that now we seemed able almost to recognize the face of the\r\nman in the look-out; and many things about the hulk we saw with greater\r\nclearness, so that we scanned her with a fresh interest. Then the man in\r\nthe look-out waved a morning greeting to us, the which we returned very\r\nheartily, and, even as we did so, there came a second figure beside the\r\nman, and waved some white matter, perchance a handkerchief, which is like\r\nenough, seeing that it was a woman, and at that, we took off our head\r\ncoverings, all of us, and shook them at her, and after this we went to\r\nour breakfast; having finished which, the bo'sun dressed our hurts, and\r\nthen, setting the man, who had lost his fingers, to watch, he took the\r\nrest of us, excepting him that was bitten in the arm, down to collect\r\nfuel, and so the time passed until near dinner.\r\n\r\nWhen we returned to the hill-top, the man upon the look-out told us that\r\nthey in the ship had heaved not less than four separate times upon the\r\nbig rope, the which, indeed, they were doing at that present minute; and\r\nit was very plain to see that the ship had come nearer even during the\r\nshort space of the morning. Now, when they had made an end of tautening\r\nthe rope, I perceived that it was, at last, well clear of the weed\r\nthrough all its length, being at its lowest part nigh twenty feet above\r\nthe surface, and, at that, a sudden thought came to me which sent me\r\nhastily to the bo'sun; for it had occurred to me that there existed no\r\nreason why we should not pay a visit to those aboard the hulk. But when I\r\nput the matter to him, he shook his head, and, for awhile, stood out\r\nagainst my desire; but, presently, having examined the rope, and\r\nconsidering that I was the lightest of any in the island, he consented,\r\nand at that I ran to the carrier which had been hauled across to our\r\nside, and got me into the chair. Now, the men, so soon as they perceived\r\nmy intention, applauded me very heartily, desiring to follow; but the\r\nbo'sun bade them be silent, and, after that, he lashed me into the chair,\r\nwith his own hands, and then signaled to those in the ship to haul upon\r\nthe small rope; he, in the meanwhile, checking my descent towards the\r\nweeds, by means of our end of the hauling-line.\r\n\r\nAnd so, presently, I had come to the lowest part, where the bight of the\r\nrope dipped downward in a bow towards the weed, and rose again to the\r\nmizzenmast of the hulk. Here I looked downward with somewhat fearful\r\neyes; for my weight on the rope made it sag somewhat lower than seemed to\r\nme comfortable, and I had a very lively recollection of some of the\r\nhorrors which that quiet surface hid. Yet I was not long in this place;\r\nfor they in the ship, perceiving how the rope let me nearer to the weed\r\nthan was safe, pulled very heartily upon the hauling-line, and so I came\r\nquickly to the hulk.\r\n\r\nNow, as I drew nigh to the ship, the men crowded upon a little platform\r\nwhich they had built in the superstructure somewhat below the broken head\r\nof the mizzen, and here they received me with loud cheers and very open\r\narms, and were so eager to get me out of the bo'sun's chair, that they\r\ncut the lashings, being too impatient to cast them loose. Then they led\r\nme down to the deck, and here, before I had knowledge of aught else, a\r\nvery buxom woman took me into her arms, kissing me right heartily, at\r\nwhich I was greatly taken aback; but the men about me did naught but\r\nlaugh, and so, in a minute, she loosed me, and there I stood, not knowing\r\nwhether to feel like a fool or a hero; but inclining rather to the\r\nlatter. Then, at this minute, there came a second woman, who bowed to me\r\nin a manner most formal, so that we might have been met in some\r\nfashionable gathering, rather than in a cast-away hulk in the\r\nlonesomeness and terror of that weed-choked sea; and at her coming all\r\nthe mirth of the men died out of them, and they became very sober, whilst\r\nthe buxom woman went backward for a piece, and seemed somewhat abashed.\r\nNow, at all this, I was greatly puzzled, and looked from one to another\r\nto learn what it might mean; but in the same moment the woman bowed\r\nagain, and said something in a low voice touching the weather, and after\r\nthat she raised her glance to my face, so that I saw her eyes, and they\r\nwere so strange and full of melancholy, that I knew on the instant why\r\nshe spoke and acted in so unmeaning a way; for the poor creature was out\r\nof her mind, and when I learnt afterwards that she was the captain's\r\nwife, and had seen him die in the arms of a mighty devil-fish, I grew to\r\nunderstand how she had come to such a pass.\r\n\r\nNow for a minute after I had discovered the woman's madness, I was so\r\ntaken aback as to be unable to answer her remark; but for this there\r\nappeared no necessity; for she turned away and went aft towards the\r\nsaloon stairway, which stood open, and here she was met by a maid very\r\nbonny and fair, who led her tenderly down from my sight. Yet, in a\r\nminute, this same maid appeared, and ran along the decks to me, and\r\ncaught my two hands, and shook them, and looked up at me with such\r\nroguish, playful eyes, that she warmed my heart, which had been\r\nstrangely chilled by the greeting of the poor mad woman. And she said\r\nmany hearty things regarding my courage, to which I knew in my heart I\r\nhad no claim; but I let her run on, and so, presently, coming more to\r\npossession of herself, she discovered that she was still holding my\r\nhands, the which, indeed, I had been conscious of the while with a very\r\ngreat pleasure; but at her discovery she dropped them with haste, and\r\nstood back from me a space, and so there came a little coolness into her\r\ntalk: yet this lasted not long; for we were both of us young, and, I\r\nthink, even thus early we attracted one the other; though, apart from\r\nthis, there was so much that we desired each to learn, that we could not\r\nbut talk freely, asking question for question, and giving answer for\r\nanswer. And thus a time passed, in which the men left us alone, and went\r\npresently to the capstan, about which they had taken the big rope, and\r\nat this they toiled awhile; for already the ship had moved sufficiently\r\nto let the line fall slack.\r\n\r\nPresently, the maid, whom I had learnt was niece to the captain's wife,\r\nand named Mary Madison, proposed to take me the round of the ship, to\r\nwhich proposal I agreed very willingly; but first I stopped to examine\r\nthe mizzen stump, and the manner in which the people of the ship had\r\nstayed it, the which they had done very cunningly, and I noted how that\r\nthey had removed some of the superstructure from about the head of the\r\nmast, so as to allow passage for the rope, without putting a strain upon\r\nthe superstructure itself. Then when I had made an end upon the poop, she\r\nled me down on to the main-deck, and here I was very greatly impressed by\r\nthe prodigious size of the structure which they had built about the hulk,\r\nand the skill with which it had been carried out, the supports crossing\r\nfrom side to side and to the decks in a manner calculated to give great\r\nsolidity to that which they upheld. Yet, I was very greatly puzzled to\r\nknow where they had gotten a sufficiency of timber to make so large a\r\nmatter; but upon this point she satisfied me by explaining that they had\r\ntaken up the 'tween decks, and used all such bulkheads as they could\r\nspare, and, further, that there had been a good deal among the dunnage\r\nwhich had proved usable.\r\n\r\nAnd so we came at last to the galley, and here I discovered the buxom\r\nwoman to be installed as cook, and there were in with her a couple of\r\nfine children, one of whom I guessed to be a boy of maybe some five\r\nyears, and the second a girl, scarce able to do more than toddle. At this\r\nI turned and asked Mistress Madison whether these were her cousins; but\r\nin the next moment I remembered that they could not be; for, as I knew,\r\nthe captain had been dead some seven years; yet it was the woman in the\r\ngalley who answered my question; for she turned and, with something of a\r\nred face, informed me that they were hers, at which I felt some surprise;\r\nbut supposed that she had taken passage in the ship with her husband; yet\r\nin this I was not correct; for she proceeded to explain that, thinking\r\nthey were cut off from the world for the rest of this life, and falling\r\nvery fond of the carpenter, they had made it up together to make a sort\r\nof marriage, and had gotten the second mate to read the service over\r\nthem. She told me then, how that she had taken passage with her mistress,\r\nthe captain's wife, to help her with her niece, who had been but a child\r\nwhen the ship sailed; for she had been very attached to them both, and\r\nthey to her. And so she came to an end of her story, expressing a hope\r\nthat she had done no wrong by her marriage, as none had been intended.\r\nAnd to this I made answer, assuring her that no decent-minded man could\r\nthink the worse of her; but that I, for my part, thought rather the\r\nbetter, seeing that I liked the pluck which she had shown. At that she\r\ncast down the soup ladle, which she had in her fist, and came towards me,\r\nwiping her hands; but I gave back, for I shamed to be hugged again, and\r\nbefore Mistress Mary Madison, and at that she came to a stop and laughed\r\nvery heartily; but, all the same, called down a very warm blessing upon\r\nmy head; for which I had no cause to feel the worse. And so I passed on\r\nwith the captain's niece.\r\n\r\nPresently, having made the round of the hulk, we came aft again to the\r\npoop, and discovered that they were heaving once more upon the big rope,\r\nthe which was very heartening, proving, as it did, that the ship was\r\nstill a-move. And so, a little later, the girl left me, having to attend\r\nto her aunt. Now whilst she was gone, the men came all about me, desiring\r\nnews of the world beyond the weed-continent, and so for the next hour I\r\nwas kept very busy, answering their questions. Then the second mate\r\ncalled out to them to take another heave upon the rope, and at that they\r\nturned to the capstan, and I with them, and so we hove it taut again,\r\nafter which they got about me once more, questioning; for so much seemed\r\nto have happened in the seven years in which they had been imprisoned.\r\nAnd then, after a while, I turned-to and questioned them on such points\r\nas I had neglected to ask Mistress Madison, and they discovered to me\r\ntheir terror and sickness of the weed-continent, its desolation and\r\nhorror, and the dread which had beset them at the thought that they\r\nshould all of them come to their ends without sight of their homes and\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nNow, about this time, I became conscious that I had grown very empty; for\r\nI had come off to the hulk before we had made our dinner, and had been in\r\nsuch interest since, that the thought of food had escaped me; for I had\r\nseen none eating in the hulk, they, without doubt, having dined earlier\r\nthan my coming. But now, being made aware of my state by the grumbling of\r\nmy stomach, I inquired whether there was any food to be had at such a\r\ntime, and, at that, one of the men ran to tell the woman in the galley\r\nthat I had missed my dinner, at which she made much ado, and set-to and\r\nprepared me a very good meal, which she carried aft and set out for me in\r\nthe saloon, and after that she sent me down to it.\r\n\r\nPresently, when I had come near to being comfortable, there chanced a\r\nlightsome step upon the floor behind me, and, turning, I discovered that\r\nMistress Madison was surveying me with a roguish and somewhat amused air.\r\nAt that, I got hastily to my feet; but she bade me sit down, and\r\ntherewith she took a seat opposite, and so bantered me with a gentle\r\nplayfulness that was not displeasing to me, and at which I played so good\r\na second as I had ability. Later, I fell to questioning her, and, among\r\nother matters, discovered that it was she who acted as scribe for the\r\npeople in the hulk, at which I told her that I had done likewise for\r\nthose on the island. After that, our talk became somewhat personal, and I\r\nlearnt that she was near on to nineteen years of age, whereat I told her\r\nthat I had passed my twenty-third. And so we chatted on, until,\r\npresently, it occurred to me that I had better be preparing to return to\r\nthe island, and I rose to my feet with this intention; yet feeling that I\r\nhad been very much happier to have stayed, the which I thought, for a\r\nmoment, had not been displeasing to her, and this I imagined, noting\r\nsomewhat in her eyes when I made mention that I must be gone. Yet it may\r\nbe that I flattered myself.\r\n\r\nNow when I came out on deck, they were busied again in heaving taut the\r\nrope, and, until they had made an end, Mistress Madison and I filled the\r\ntime with such chatter as is wholesome between a man and maid who have\r\nnot long met, yet find one another pleasing company. Then, when at last\r\nthe rope was taut, I went up to the mizzen staging, and climbed into the\r\nchair, after which some of the men lashed me in very securely. Yet when\r\nthey gave the signal to haul me to the island, there came for awhile no\r\nresponse, and then signs that we could not understand; but no movement to\r\nhaul me across the weed. At that, they unlashed me from the chair,\r\nbidding me get out, whilst they sent a message to discover what might be\r\nwrong. And this they did, and, presently, there came back word that the\r\nbig rope had stranded upon the edge of the cliff, and that they must\r\nslacken it somewhat at once, the which they did, with many expressions of\r\ndismay. And so, maybe an hour passed, during which we watched the men\r\nworking at the rope, just where it came down over the edge of the hill,\r\nand Mistress Madison stood with us and watched; for it was very terrible,\r\nthis sudden thought of failure (though it were but temporary) when they\r\nwere so near to success. Yet, at last there came a signal from the island\r\nfor us to loose the hauling-line, the which we did, allowing them to haul\r\nacross the carrier, and so, in a little while, they signaled back to us\r\nto pull in, which, having done, we found a letter in the bag lashed to\r\nthe carrier, in which the bo'sun made it plain that he had strengthened\r\nthe rope, and placed fresh chafing gear about it, so that he thought it\r\nwould be so safe as ever to heave upon; but to put it to a less strain.\r\nYet he refused to allow me to venture across upon it, saying that I must\r\nstay in the ship until we were clear of the weed; for if the rope had\r\nstranded in one place, then had it been so cruelly tested that there\r\nmight be some other points at which it was ready to give. And this final\r\nnote of the bo'sun's made us all very serious; for, indeed, it seemed\r\npossible that it was as he suggested; yet they reassured themselves by\r\npointing out that, like enough, it had been the chafe upon the cliff edge\r\nwhich had frayed the strand, so that it had been weakened before it\r\nparted; but I, remembering the chafing gear which the bo'sun had put\r\nabout it in the first instance, felt not so sure; yet I would not add to\r\ntheir anxieties.\r\n\r\nAnd so it came about that I was compelled to spend the night in the hulk;\r\nbut, as I followed Mistress Madison into the big saloon, I felt no\r\nregret, and had near forgotten already my anxiety regarding the rope.\r\n\r\nAnd out on deck there sounded most cheerily the clack of the capstan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nFreed\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, when Mistress Madison had seated herself, she invited me to do\r\nlikewise, after which we fell into talk, first touching upon the matter\r\nof the stranding of the rope, about which I hastened to assure her, and\r\nlater to other things, and so, as is natural enough with a man and maid,\r\nto ourselves, and here we were very content to let it remain.\r\n\r\nPresently, the second mate came in with a note from the bo'sun, which he\r\nlaid upon the table for the girl to read, the which she beckoned me to do\r\nalso, and so I discovered that it was a suggestion, written very rudely\r\nand ill-spelt, that they should send us a quantity of reeds from the\r\nisland, with which we might be able to ease the weed somewhat from around\r\nthe stern of the hulk, thus aiding her progress. And to this the second\r\nmate desired the girl to write a reply, saying that we should be very\r\nhappy for the reeds, and would endeavor to act upon his hint, and this\r\nMistress Madison did, after which she passed the letter to me, perchance\r\nI desired to send any message. Yet I had naught that I wished to say, and\r\nso handed it back, with a word of thanks, and, at once, she gave it to\r\nthe second mate, who went, forthwith, and dispatched it.\r\n\r\nLater, the stout woman from the galley came aft to set out the table,\r\nwhich occupied the center of the saloon, and whilst she was at this, she\r\nasked for information on many things, being very free and unaffected in\r\nher speech, and seeming with less of deference to my companion, than a\r\ncertain motherliness; for it was very plain that she loved Mistress\r\nMadison, and in this my heart did not blame her. Further, it was plain to\r\nme that the girl had a very warm affection for her old nurse, which was\r\nbut natural, seeing that the old woman had cared for her through all the\r\npast years, besides being companion to her, and a good and cheerful one,\r\nas I could guess.\r\n\r\nNow awhile I passed in answering the buxom woman's questions, and odd\r\ntimes such occasional ones as were slipped in by Mistress Madison; and\r\nthen, suddenly there came the clatter of men's feet overhead, and, later,\r\nthe thud of something being cast down upon the deck, and so we knew that\r\nthe reeds had come. At that, Mistress Madison cried out that we should go\r\nand watch the men try them upon the weed; for that if they proved of use\r\nin easing that which lay in our path, then should we come the more\r\nspeedily to the clear water, and this without the need of putting so\r\ngreat a strain upon the hawser, as had been the case hitherto.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to the poop, we found the men removing a portion of the\r\nsuperstructure over the stern, and after that they took some of the\r\nstronger reeds, and proceeded to work at the weed that stretched away in\r\na line with our taffrail. Yet that they anticipated danger, I perceived;\r\nfor there stood by them two of the men and the second mate, all armed\r\nwith muskets, and these three kept a very strict watch upon the weed,\r\nknowing, through much experience of its terrors, how that there might be\r\na need for their weapons at any moment. And so a while passed, and it\r\nwas plain that the men's work upon the weed was having effect; for the\r\nrope grew slack visibly, and those at the capstan had all that they\r\ncould do, taking fleet and fleet with the tackle, to keep it anywhere\r\nnear to tautness, and so, perceiving that they were kept so hard at it,\r\nI ran to give a hand, the which did Mistress Madison, pushing upon the\r\ncapstan-bars right merrily and with heartiness. And thus a while passed,\r\nand the evening began to come down upon the lonesomeness of the\r\nweed-continent. Then there appeared the buxom woman, and bade us come to\r\nour suppers, and her manner of addressing the two of us was the manner\r\nof one who might have mothered us; but Mistress Madison cried out to her\r\nto wait, that we had found work to do, and at that the big woman\r\nlaughed, and came towards us threateningly, as though intending to\r\nremove us hence by force.\r\n\r\nAnd now, at this moment, there came a sudden interruption which checked\r\nour merriment; for, abruptly, there sounded the report of a musket in\r\nthe stern, and then came shouts, and the noise of the two other weapons,\r\nseeming like thunder, being pent by the over-arching superstructure.\r\nAnd, directly, the men about the taffrail gave back, running here and\r\nthere, and so I saw that great arms had come all about the opening which\r\nthey had made in the superstructure, and two of these flickered\r\nin-board, searching hither and thither; but the stout woman took a man\r\nnear to her, and thrust him out of danger, and after that, she caught\r\nMistress Madison up in her big arms, and ran down on to the main-deck\r\nwith her, and all this before I had come to a full knowledge of our\r\ndanger. But now I perceived that I should do well to get further back\r\nfrom the stern, the which I did with haste, and, coming to a safe\r\nposition, I stood and stared at the huge creature, its great arms, vague\r\nin the growing dusk, writhing about in vain search for a victim. Then\r\nreturned the second mate, having been for more weapons, and now I\r\nobserved that he armed all the men, and had brought up a spare musket\r\nfor my use, and so we commenced, all of us, to fire at the monster,\r\nwhereat it began to lash about most furiously, and so, after some\r\nminutes, it slipped away from the opening and slid down into the weed.\r\nUpon that several of the men rushed to replace those parts of the\r\nsuperstructure which had been removed, and I with them; yet there were\r\nsufficient for the job, so that I had no need to do aught; thus, before\r\nthey had made up the opening, I had been given chance to look out upon\r\nthe weed, and so discovered that all the surface which lay between our\r\nstern and the island, was moving in vast ripples, as though mighty fish\r\nwere swimming beneath it, and then, just before the men put back the\r\nlast of the great panels, I saw the weed all tossed up like to a vast\r\npot a-boil, and then a vague glimpse of thousands of monstrous arms that\r\nfilled the air, and came towards the ship.\r\n\r\nAnd then the men had the panel back in its place, and were hasting to\r\ndrive the supporting struts into their positions. And when this was done,\r\nwe stood awhile and listened; but there came no sound above that of the\r\nwail of the wind across the extent of the weed-continent. And at that, I\r\nturned to the men, asking how it was that I could hear no sounds of the\r\ncreatures attacking us, and so they took me up into the look-out place,\r\nand from there I stared down at the weed; but it was without movement,\r\nsave for the stirring of the wind, and there was nowhere any sign of the\r\ndevil-fish. Then, seeing me amazed, they told me how that anything which\r\nmoved the weed seemed to draw them from all parts; but that they seldom\r\ntouched the hulk unless there was something visible to them which had\r\nmovement. Yet, as they went on to explain, there would be hundreds and\r\nhundreds of them lying all about the ship, hiding in the weed; but that\r\nif we took care not to show ourselves within their reach, they would have\r\ngone most of them by the morning. And this the men told me in a very\r\nmatter-of-fact way; for they had become inured to such happenings.\r\n\r\nPresently, I heard Mistress Madison calling to me by name, and so\r\ndescended out of the growing darkness, to the interior of the\r\nsuperstructure, and here they had lit a number of rude slush-lamps, the\r\noil for which, as I learned later, they obtained from a certain fish\r\nwhich haunted the sea, beneath the weed, in very large schools, and took\r\nnear any sort of bait with great readiness. And so, when I had climbed\r\ndown into the light, I found the girl waiting for me to come to supper,\r\nfor which I discovered myself to be in a mightily agreeable humor.\r\n\r\nPresently, having made an end of eating, she leaned back in her seat and\r\ncommenced once more to bait me in her playful manner, the which appeared\r\nto afford her much pleasure, and in which I joined with no less, and so\r\nwe fell presently to more earnest talk, and in this wise we passed a\r\ngreat space of the evening. Then there came to her a sudden idea, and\r\nwhat must she do but propose that we should climb to the lookout, and to\r\nthis I agreed with a very happy willingness. And to the lookout we went.\r\nNow when we had come there, I perceived her reason for this freak; for\r\naway in the night, astern the hulk, there blazed half-way between the\r\nheaven and the sea, a mighty glow, and suddenly, as I stared, being dumb\r\nwith admiration and surprise, I knew that it was the blaze of our fires\r\nupon the crown of the bigger hill; for, all the hill being in shadow, and\r\nhidden by the darkness, there showed only the glow of the fires, hung, as\r\nit were, in the void, and a very striking and beautiful spectacle it was.\r\nThen, as I watched, there came, abruptly a figure into view upon the\r\nedge of the glow, showing black and minute, and this I knew to be one of\r\nthe men come to the edge of the hill to take a look at the hulk, or test\r\nthe strain on the hawser. Now, upon my expressing admiration of the sight\r\nto Mistress Madison, she seemed greatly pleased, and told me that she had\r\nbeen up many times in the darkness to view it. And after that we went\r\ndown again into the interior of the superstructure, and here the men were\r\ntaking a further heave upon the big rope, before settling the watches for\r\nthe night, the which they managed, by having one man at a time to keep\r\nawake and call the rest whenever the hawser grew slack.\r\n\r\nLater Mistress Madison showed me where I was to sleep, and so, having bid\r\none another a very warm good-night, we parted, she going to see that her\r\naunt was comfortable, and I out on to the main-deck to have a chat with\r\nthe man on watch. In this way, I passed the time until midnight, and in\r\nthat while we had been forced to call the men thrice to heave upon the\r\nhawser, so quickly had the ship begun to make way through the weed. Then,\r\nhaving grown sleepy, I said goodnight, and went to my berth, and so had\r\nmy first sleep upon a mattress, for some weeks.\r\n\r\nNow when the morning was come, I waked, hearing Mistress Madison calling\r\nupon me from the other side of my door, and rating me very saucily for a\r\nlie-a-bed, and at that I made good speed at dressing, and came quickly\r\ninto the saloon, where she had ready a breakfast that made me glad I had\r\nwaked. But first, before she would do aught else, she had me out to the\r\nlookout place, running up before me most merrily and singing in the\r\nfullness of her glee, and so, when I had come to the top of the\r\nsuperstructure, I perceived that she had very good reason for so much\r\nmerriment, and the sight which came to my eyes, gladdened me most\r\nmightily, yet at the same time filling me with a great amazement; for,\r\nbehold! in the course of that one night, we had made near unto two\r\nhundred fathoms across the weed, being now, with what we had made\r\npreviously, no more than some thirty fathoms in from the edge of the\r\nweed. And there stood Mistress Madison beside me, doing somewhat of a\r\ndainty step-dance upon the flooring of the look-out, and singing a quaint\r\nold lilt that I had not heard that dozen years, and this little thing, I\r\nthink, brought back more clearly to me than aught else how that this\r\nwinsome maid had been lost to the world for so many years, having been\r\nscarce of the age of twelve when the ship had been lost in the\r\nweed-continent. Then, as I turned to make some remark, being filled with\r\nmany feelings, there came a hail, from far above in the air, as it might\r\nbe, and, looking up, I discovered the man upon the hill to be standing\r\nalong the edge, and waving to us, and now I perceived how that the hill\r\ntowered a very great way above us, seeming, as it were, to overhang the\r\nhulk though we were yet some seventy fathoms distant from the sheer sweep\r\nof its nearer precipice. And so, having waved back our greeting, we made\r\ndown to breakfast, and, having come to the saloon, set-to upon the good\r\nvictuals, and did very sound justice thereto.\r\n\r\nPresently, having made an end of eating, and hearing the clack of the\r\ncapstan-pawls, we hurried out on deck, and put our hands upon the bars,\r\nintending to join in that last heave which should bring the ship free out\r\nof her long captivity, and so for a time we moved round about the\r\ncapstan, and I glanced at the girl beside me; for she had become very\r\nsolemn, and indeed it was a strange and solemn time for her; for she, who\r\nhad dreamed of the world as her childish eyes had seen it, was now, after\r\nmany hopeless years, to go forth once more to it--to live in it, and to\r\nlearn how much had been dreams, and how much real; and with all these\r\nthoughts I credited her; for they seemed such as would have come to me at\r\nsuch a time, and, presently, I made some blundering effort to show to\r\nher that I had understanding of the tumult which possessed her, and at\r\nthat she smiled up at me with a sudden queer flash of sadness and\r\nmerriment, and our glances met, and I saw something in hers, which was\r\nbut newborn, and though I was but a young man, my heart interpreted it\r\nfor me, and I was all hot suddenly with the pain and sweet delight of\r\nthis new thing; for I had not dared to think upon that which already my\r\nheart had made bold to whisper to me, so that even thus soon I was\r\nmiserable out of her presence. Then she looked downward at her hands upon\r\nthe bar; and, in the same instant, there came a loud, abrupt cry from the\r\nsecond mate, to vast heaving, and at that all the men pulled out their\r\nbars and cast them upon the deck, and ran, shouting, to the ladder that\r\nled to the look-out, and we followed, and so came to the top, and\r\ndiscovered that at last the ship was clear of the weed, and floating in\r\nthe open water between it and the island.\r\n\r\nNow at the discovery that the hulk was free, the men commenced to cheer\r\nand shout in a very wild fashion, as, indeed, is no cause for wonder, and\r\nwe cheered with them. Then, suddenly, in the midst of our shouting,\r\nMistress Madison plucked me by the sleeve and pointed to the end of the\r\nisland where the foot of the bigger hill jutted out in a great spur, and\r\nnow I perceived a boat, coming round into view, and in another moment I\r\nsaw that the bo'sun stood in the stern, steering; thus I knew that he\r\nmust have finished repairing her whilst I had been on the hulk. By this,\r\nthe men about us had discovered the nearness of the boat, and commenced\r\nshouting afresh, and they ran down, and to the bows of the vessel, and\r\ngot ready a rope to cast. Now when the boat came near, the men in her\r\nscanned us very curiously, but the bo'sun took off his head-gear, with a\r\nclumsy grace that well became him; at which Mistress Madison smiled very\r\nkindly upon him, and, after that, she told me with great frankness that\r\nhe pleased her, and, more, that she had never seen so great a man, which\r\nwas not strange seeing that she had seen but few since she had come to\r\nyears when men become of interest to a maid.\r\n\r\nAfter saluting us the bo'sun called out to the second mate that he would\r\ntow us round to the far side of the island, and to this the officer\r\nagreed, being, I surmised, by no means sorry to put some solid matter\r\nbetween himself and the desolation of the great weed-continent; and so,\r\nhaving loosed the hawser, which fell from the hill-top with a prodigious\r\nsplash, we had the boat head, towing. In this wise we opened out,\r\npresently, the end of the hill; but feeling now the force of the breeze,\r\nwe bent a kedge to the hawser, and, the bo'sun carrying it seawards, we\r\nwarped ourselves to windward of the island, and here, in forty fathoms,\r\nwe vast heaving, and rode to the kedge.\r\n\r\nNow when this was accomplished they called to our men to come aboard, and\r\nthis they did, and spent all of that day in talk and eating; for those in\r\nthe ship could scarce make enough of our fellows. And then, when it had\r\ncome to night, they replaced that part of the superstructure which they\r\nhad removed from about the head of the mizzen-stump, and so, all being\r\nsecure, each one turned-in and had a full night's rest, of the which,\r\nindeed, many of them stood in sore need.\r\n\r\nThe following morning, the second mate had a consultation with the\r\nbo'sun, after which he gave the order to commence upon the removal of the\r\ngreat superstructure, and to this each one of us set himself with vigor.\r\nYet it was a work requiring some time, and near five days had passed\r\nbefore we had the ship stripped clear. When this had been accomplished,\r\nthere came a busy time of routing out various matter of which we should\r\nhave need in jury rigging her; for they had been so long in disuse, that\r\nnone remembered where to look for them. At this a day and a half was\r\nspent, and after that we set-to about fitting her with such jury-masts as\r\nwe could manage from our material.\r\n\r\nNow, after the ship had been dismasted, all those seven years gone, the\r\ncrew had been able to save many of her spars, these having remained\r\nattached to her, through their inability to cut away all of the gear; and\r\nthough this had put them in sore peril at the time, of being sent to the\r\nbottom with a hole in their side, yet now had they every reason to be\r\nthankful; for, by this accident, we had now a foreyard, a topsail-yard, a\r\nmain t'gallant-yard, and the fore-topmast. They had saved more than\r\nthese; but had made use of the smaller spars to shore up the\r\nsuperstructure, sawing them into lengths for that purpose. Apart from\r\nsuch spars as they had managed to secure, they had a spare topmast lashed\r\nalong under the larboard bulwarks, and a spare t'gallant and royal mast\r\nlying along the starboard side.\r\n\r\nNow, the second mate and the bo'sun set the carpenter to work upon the\r\nspare topmast, bidding him make for it some trestle-trees and bolsters,\r\nupon which to lay the eyes of the rigging; but they did not trouble him\r\nto shape it. Further, they ordered the same to be fitted to the\r\nforetopmast and the spare t'gallant and royal mast. And in the meanwhile,\r\nthe rigging was prepared, and when this was finished, they made ready the\r\nshears to hoist the spare topmast, intending this to take the place of\r\nthe main lower-mast. Then, when the carpenter had carried out their\r\norders, he was set to make three partners with a step cut in each, these\r\nbeing intended to take the heels of the three masts, and when these were\r\ncompleted, they bolted them securely to the decks at the fore part of\r\neach one of the stumps of the three lower-masts. And so, having all\r\nready, we hove the mainmast into position, after which we proceeded to\r\nrig it. Now, when we had made an end of this, we set-to upon the\r\nforemast, using for this the foretopmast which they had saved, and after\r\nthat we hove the mizzenmast into place, having for this the spare\r\nt'gallant and royal mast.\r\n\r\nNow the manner in which we secured the masts, before ever we came to the\r\nrigging of them, was by lashing them to the stumps of the lower-masts,\r\nand after we had lashed them, we drove dunnage and wedges between the\r\nmasts and the lashings, thus making them very secure. And so, when we had\r\nset up the rigging, we had confidence that they would stand all such sail\r\nas we should be able to set upon them. Yet, further than this, the bo'sun\r\nbade the carpenter make wooden caps of six inch oak, these caps to fit\r\nover the _squared_ heads of the lower-mast stumps, and having a hole,\r\neach of them, to embrace the jury-mast, and by making these caps in two\r\nhalves, they were able to bolt them on after the masts had been hove\r\ninto position.\r\n\r\nAnd so, having gotten in our three jury lower-masts, we hoisted up the\r\nforeyard to the main, to act as our mainyard, and did likewise with the\r\ntopsail-yard to the fore, and after that, we sent up the t'gallant-yard\r\nto the mizzen. Thus we had her sparred, all but a bowsprit and jibboom;\r\nyet this we managed by making a stumpy, spike bowsprit from one of the\r\nsmaller spars which they had used to shore up the superstructure, and\r\nbecause we feared that it lacked strength to bear the strain of our fore\r\nand aft stays, we took down two hawsers from the fore, passing them in\r\nthrough the hawse-holes and setting them up there. And so we had her\r\nrigged, and, after that, we bent such sail as our gear abled us to carry,\r\nand in this wise had the hulk ready for sea.\r\n\r\nNow, the time that it took us to rig the ship, and fit her out, was seven\r\nweeks, saving one day. And in all this time we suffered no molestation\r\nfrom any of the strange habitants of the weed-continent; though this may\r\nhave been because we kept fires of dried weed going all the night about\r\nthe decks, these fires being lit on big flat pieces of rock which we had\r\ngotten from the island. Yet, for all that we had not been troubled, we\r\nhad more than once discovered strange things in the water swimming near\r\nto the vessel; but a flare of weed, hung over the side, on the end of a\r\nreed, had sufficed always to scare away such unholy visitants.\r\n\r\nAnd so at last we came to the day on which we were in so good a\r\ncondition that the bo'sun and the second mate considered the ship to be\r\nin a fit state to put to sea--the carpenter having gone over so much of\r\nher hull as he could get at and found her everywhere very sound; though\r\nher lower parts were hideously overgrown with weed, barnacles and other\r\nmatters; yet this we could not help, and it was not wise to attempt to\r\nscrape her, having consideration to the creatures which we knew to\r\nabound in those waters.\r\n\r\nNow in those seven weeks, Mistress Madison and I had come very close to\r\none another, so that I had ceased to call her by any name save Mary,\r\nunless it were a dearer one than that; though this would be one of my own\r\ninvention, and would leave my heart too naked did I put it down here.\r\n\r\nOf our love one for the other, I think yet, and ponder how that mighty\r\nman, the bo'sun, came so quickly to a knowledge of the state of our\r\nhearts; for he gave me a very sly hint one day that he had a sound idea\r\nof the way in which the wind blew, and yet, though he said it with a\r\nhalf-jest, methought there was something wistful in his voice, as he\r\nspoke, and at that I just clapped my hand in his, and he gave it a very\r\nhuge grip. And after that he ceased from the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nHow We Came to Our Own Country\r\n\r\n\r\nNow, when the day came on which we made to leave the nearness of the\r\nisland, and the waters of that strange sea, there was great lightness\r\nof heart among us, and we went very merrily about such tasks as were\r\nneedful. And so, in a little, we had the kedge tripped, and had cast\r\nthe ship's head to starboard, and presently, had her braced up upon\r\nthe larboard tack, the which we managed very well; though our gear\r\nworked heavily, as might be expected. And after that we had gotten\r\nunder way, we went to the lee side to witness the last of that\r\nlonesome island, and with us came the men of the ship, and so, for a\r\nspace, there was a silence among us; for they were very quiet, looking\r\nastern and saying naught; but we had sympathy with them, knowing\r\nsomewhat of those past years.\r\n\r\nAnd now the bo'sun came to the break of the poop, and called down to the\r\nmen to muster aft, the which they did, and I with them; for I had come to\r\nregard them as my very good comrades; and rum was served out to each of\r\nthem, and to me along with the rest, and it was Mistress Madison herself\r\nwho dipped it out to us from the wooden bucket; though it was the buxom\r\nwoman who had brought it up from the lazarette. Now, after the rum, the\r\nbo'sun bade the crew to clear up the gear about the decks, and get\r\nmatters secured, and at that I turned to go with the men, having become\r\nso used to work with them; but he called to me to come up to him upon the\r\npoop, the which I did, and there he spoke respectfully, remonstrating\r\nwith me, and reminding me that now there was need no longer for me to\r\ntoil; for that I was come back to my old position of passenger, such as I\r\nhad been in the _Glen Carrig_, ere she foundered. But to this talk of\r\nhis, I made reply that I had as good a right to work my passage home as\r\nany other among us; for though I had paid for a passage in the _Glen\r\nCarrig_, I had done no such thing regarding the _Seabird_--this being the\r\nname of the hulk--and to this, my reply, the bo'sun said little; but I\r\nperceived that he liked my spirit, and so from thence until we reached\r\nthe Port of London, I took my turn and part in all seafaring matters,\r\nhaving become by this quite proficient in the calling. Yet, in one\r\nmatter, I availed myself of my former position; for I chose to live aft,\r\nand by this was abled to see much of my sweetheart, Mistress Madison.\r\n\r\nNow after dinner upon the day on which we left the island, the bo'sun and\r\nthe second mate picked the watches, and thus I found myself chosen to be\r\nin the bo'sun's, at which I was mightly pleased. And when the watches had\r\nbeen picked, they had all hands to 'bout ship, the which, to the pleasure\r\nof all, she accomplished; for under such gear and with so much growth\r\nupon her bottom, they had feared that we should have to veer, and by this\r\nwe should have lost much distance to leeward, whereas we desired to edge\r\nso much to windward as we could, being anxious to put space between us\r\nand the weed-continent. And twice more that day we put the ship about,\r\nthough the second time it was to avoid a great bank of weed that lay\r\nfloating athwart our bows; for all the sea to windward of the island, so\r\nfar as we had been able to see from the top of the higher hill, was\r\nstudded with floating masses of the weed, like unto thousands of islets,\r\nand in places like to far-spreading reefs. And, because of these, the sea\r\nall about the island remained very quiet and unbroken, so that there was\r\nnever any surf, no, nor scarce a broken wave upon its shore, and this,\r\nfor all that the wind had been fresh for many days.\r\n\r\nWhen the evening came, we were again upon the larboard tack, making,\r\nperhaps, some four knots in the hour; though, had we been in proper rig,\r\nand with a clean bottom, we had been making eight or nine, with so good a\r\nbreeze and so calm a sea. Yet, so far, our progress had been very\r\nreasonable; for the island lay, maybe, some five miles to leeward, and\r\nabout fifteen astern. And so we prepared for the night. Yet, a little\r\nbefore dark, we discovered that the weed-continent trended out towards\r\nus; so that we should pass it, maybe, at a distance of something like\r\nhalf a mile, and, at that, there was talk between the second mate and the\r\nbo'sun as to whether it was better to put the ship about, and gain a\r\ngreater sea-room before attempting to pass this promontory of weed; but\r\nat last they decided that we had naught to fear; for we had fair way\r\nthrough the water, and further, it did not seem reasonable to suppose\r\nthat we should have aught to fear from the habitants of the\r\nweed-continent, at so great a distance as the half of a mile. And so we\r\nstood on; for, once past the point, there was much likelihood of the weed\r\ntrending away to the Eastward, and if this were so, we could square-in\r\nimmediately and get the wind upon our quarter, and so make better way.\r\n\r\nNow it was the bo'sun's watch from eight of the evening until midnight,\r\nand I, with another man, had the lookout until four bells. Thus it\r\nchanced that, coming abreast of the point during our time of watching,\r\nwe peered very earnestly to leeward; for the night was dark, having no\r\nmoon until nearer the morning; and we were full of unease in that we had\r\ncome so near again to the desolation of that strange continent. And\r\nthen, suddenly, the man with me clutched my shoulder, and pointed into\r\nthe darkness upon our bow, and thus I discovered that we had come nearer\r\nto the weed than the bo'sun and the second mate had intended; they,\r\nwithout doubt, having miscalculated our leeway. At this, I turned and\r\nsang out to the bo'sun that we were near to running upon the weed, and,\r\nin the same moment, he shouted to the helmsman to luff, and directly\r\nafterwards our starboard side was brushing against the great outlying\r\ntufts of the point, and so, for a breathless minute, we waited. Yet the\r\nship drew clear, and so into the open water beyond the point; but I had\r\nseen something as we scraped against the weed, a sudden glimpse of\r\nwhite, gliding among the growth, and then I saw others, and, in a\r\nmoment, I was down on the main-deck, and running aft to the bo'sun; yet\r\nmidway along the deck a horrid shape came above the starboard rail, and\r\nI gave out a loud cry of warning. Then I had a capstan-bar from the rack\r\nnear, and smote with it at the thing, crying all the while for help, and\r\nat my blow the thing went from my sight, and the bo'sun was with me, and\r\nsome of the men.\r\n\r\nNow the bo'sun had seen my stroke, and so sprang upon the t'gallant rail,\r\nand peered over; but gave back on the instant, shouting to me to run and\r\ncall the other watch, for that the sea was full of the monsters swimming\r\noff to the ship, and at that I was away at a run, and when I had waked\r\nthe men, I raced aft to the cabin and did likewise with the second mate,\r\nand so returned in a minute, bearing the bo'sun's cutlass, my own\r\ncut-and-thrust, and the lantern that hung always in the saloon. Now when\r\nI had gotten back, I found all things in a mighty scurry--men running\r\nabout in their shirts and drawers, some in the galley bringing fire from\r\nthe stove, and others lighting a fire of dry weed to leeward of the\r\ngalley, and along the starboard rail there was already a fierce fight,\r\nthe men using capstan-bars, even as I had done. Then I thrust the\r\nbo'sun's cutlass into his hand, and at that he gave a great shout, part\r\nof joy, and part of approbation, and after that he snatched the lantern\r\nfrom me, and had run to the larboard side of the deck, before I was well\r\naware that he had taken the light; but now I followed him, and happy it\r\nwas for all of us in the ship that he had thought to go at that moment;\r\nfor the light of the lantern showed me the vile faces of three of the\r\nweed men climbing over the larboard rail; yet the bo'sun had cleft them\r\nor ever I could come near; but in a moment I was full busy; for there\r\ncame nigh a dozen heads above the rail a little aft of where I was, and\r\nat that I ran at them, and did good execution; but some had been aboard,\r\nif the bo'sun had not come to my help. And now the decks were full of\r\nlight, several fires having been lit, and the second mate having brought\r\nout fresh lanterns; and now the men had gotten their cutlasses, the which\r\nwere more handy than the capstan-bars; and so the fight went forward,\r\nsome having come over to our side to help us, and a very wild sight it\r\nmust have seemed to any onlooker; for all about the decks burned the\r\nfires and the lanterns, and along the rails ran the men, smiting at\r\nhideous faces that rose in dozens into the wild glare of our fighting\r\nlights. And everywhere drifted the stench of the brutes. And up on the\r\npoop, the fight was as brisk as elsewhere; and here, having been drawn by\r\na cry for help, I discovered the buxom woman smiting with a gory meat-axe\r\nat a vile thing which had gotten a clump of its tentacles upon her dress;\r\nbut she had dispatched it, or ever my sword could help her, and then, to\r\nmy astonishment, even at that time of peril, I discovered the captain's\r\nwife, wielding a small sword, and the face of her was like to the face of\r\na tiger; for her mouth was drawn, and showed her teeth clenched; but she\r\nuttered no word nor cry, and I doubt not but that she had some vague idea\r\nthat she worked her husband's vengeance.\r\n\r\nThen, for a space, I was as busy as any, and afterwards I ran to the\r\nbuxom woman to demand the whereabouts of Mistress Madison, and she, in a\r\nvery breathless voice, informed me that she had locked her in her room\r\nout of harm's way, and at that I could have embraced the woman; for I had\r\nbeen sorely anxious to know that my sweetheart was safe.\r\n\r\nAnd, presently, the fight diminished, and so, at last, came to an end,\r\nthe ship having drawn well away from the point, and being now in the\r\nopen. And after that I ran down to my sweetheart, and opened her door,\r\nand thus, for a space, she wept, having her arms about my neck; for she\r\nhad been in sore terror for me, and for all the ship's company. But,\r\nsoon, drying her tears, she grew very indignant with her nurse for having\r\nlocked her into her room, and refused to speak to that good woman for\r\nnear an hour. Yet I pointed out to her that she could be of very great\r\nuse in dressing such wounds as had been received, and so she came back to\r\nher usual brightness, and brought out bandages, and lint, and ointment,\r\nand thread, and was presently very busy.\r\n\r\nNow it was later that there rose a fresh commotion in the ship; for it\r\nhad been discovered that the captain's wife was a-missing. At this, the\r\nbo'sun and the second mate instituted a search; but she was nowhere to be\r\nfound, and, indeed, none in the ship ever saw her again, at which it was\r\npresumed that she had been dragged over by some of the weed men, and so\r\ncome upon her death. And at this, there came a great prostration to my\r\nsweetheart so that she would not be comforted for the space of nigh three\r\ndays, by which time the ship had come clear of those strange seas, having\r\nleft the incredible desolation of the weed-continent far under our\r\nstarboard counter.\r\n\r\nAnd so, after a voyage which lasted for nine and seventy days since\r\ngetting under weigh, we came to the Port of London, having refused all\r\noffers of assistance on the way.\r\n\r\nNow here, I had to say farewell to my comrades of so many months and\r\nperilous adventures; yet, being a man not entirely without means, I\r\ntook care that each of them should have a certain gift by which to\r\nremember me.\r\n\r\nAnd I placed monies in the hands of the buxom woman, so that she could\r\nhave no reason to stint my sweetheart, and she having--for the comfort of\r\nher conscience--taken her good man to the church, set up a little house\r\nupon the borders of my estate; but this was not until Mistress Madison\r\nhad come to take her place at the head of my hall in the County of Essex.\r\n\r\nNow one further thing there is of which I must tell. Should any,\r\nchancing to trespass upon my estate, come upon a man of very mighty\r\nproportions, albeit somewhat bent by age, seated comfortably at the door\r\nof his little cottage, then shall they know him for my friend the\r\nbo'sun; for to this day do he and I fore-gather, and let our talk drift\r\nto the desolate places of this earth, pondering upon that which we have\r\nseen--the weed-continent, where reigns desolation and the terror of its\r\nstrange habitants. And, after that, we talk softly of the land where God\r\nhath made monsters after the fashion of trees. Then, maybe, my children\r\ncome about me, and so we change to other matters; for the little ones\r\nlove not terror.",
