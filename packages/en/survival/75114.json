This book is planned for the reading of those who desire\r\nto know something of the wonders of the New Air World into which man\r\nis just now entering, for those who desire to become weatherwise and\r\nmake forecasts for themselves, and to apply their knowledge to their\r\nbusiness, their health, and their happiness; and for the reading of\r\nthe more advanced pupils of the public schools.\r\n\r\nSo far as possible technical terms are avoided and an effort made to\r\ntell a simple story that will awaken curiosity and lead the reader\r\nto wish to know more and more of the mysteries of the atmosphere, of\r\nwhich practically nothing was known at the time of the landing of\r\nthe Pilgrims, Torricelli not having discovered the barometer until\r\ntwenty-three years later. It will be made plain how atmospheric\r\nair was formed, how long it will remain, whither it will go, how it\r\nis heated, cooled, and lighted; where and how storms, cold waves,\r\nclouds, frosts, and fair-weather conditions originate and how move;\r\nhow the cyclone, the tornado, and the thunderstorm may be recognized\r\non the Daily Weather Map of the Government and their future\r\nactivities forecast; how a fund of simple yet wonderful information\r\nthat will be of inestimable value may be acquired by any intelligent\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nThe author acknowledges courtesies extended to him by Prof. Charles\r\nF. Marvin, present chief of the Weather Bureau, and by R.

The earth had not yet cooled down to the condition of\r\na solid crust, everything that the eye now sees existed in the form\r\nof invisible gases, or as clouds incandescent with white heat. Fiery\r\nblasts swirled over the face of the earth. Storms a million times\r\nmore powerful than the most destructive West Indian hurricane of the\r\npresent day moved through the indescribably hot atmosphere, throwing\r\ndown not rain as we understand it, but liquid earth and metal, as\r\ntheir rising clouds ascended and cooled. It is difficult for the\r\nhuman mind to grasp the wonders of this.\r\n\r\nSmall planets cool quicker than large ones and sooner come to\r\nthe conditions of a crust and to a temperature suitable for the\r\ndevelopment of the various forms of life.\r\n\r\n=Atmosphere of the Sun.= To the unaided eye it appears as a smooth,\r\nbright, quiescent sphere, but the telescope reveals millions of\r\nagitations and hundreds of red flames that shoot outward to distances\r\nof hundreds of thousands of miles. One can form no adequate picture\r\nof the convulsions of the atmosphere of the sun. During eclipses,\r\nwhen the intense glare of its center is obscured, hydrogen flames may\r\nbe seen darting outward for as much as a million miles.\r\n\r\n=Lifeless Planets.= The larger a planet the longer is the time that\r\nmust elapse before the hot vapors of rock and metal, which largely\r\ncompose its early atmosphere, cool and congeal into a crust, leaving\r\nas a residual an atmosphere of such heat, density, and composition as\r\nto permit of the beginnings of the forms of life that have inhabited\r\nthe world. Before the sun can reach this condition, an indescribable\r\nperiod will have elapsed, its light will have gone out, its heat\r\nwill have ceased to reach the earth and the other planets in\r\nquantities sufficient to maintain life, the earth will have been dead\r\nmillions of years, and the sun itself will only receive heat and\r\nlight from the feeble rays of the stars that, unlike itself, have not\r\nyet ceased to shine. But even then the sun ever must remain dead, for\r\nthere is no external source whence it may receive heat. No vegetation\r\ncan adorn it, no water flow upon its surface, neither can the foot of\r\nany man press its soil.\r\n\r\nJupiter, and perhaps Neptune, Uranus, and Saturn, have hot\r\natmospheres still in violent agitation,—molten surfaces composed\r\nof all kinds of matter, from which bubble and boil off hot clouds\r\nof vapor that surge about in huge eddies or cyclonic storms, and\r\nthat here and there are shot outward in tongues of fire. The earth\r\nmillions of years ago had a similar atmosphere. But when the heat\r\nenergy of these vaporous planets wanes, and they cool down, as the\r\nearth did many years ago, the simplest forms of life cannot be\r\nevolved upon them, for they are too far away from the sun to receive\r\nlife-giving heat. Mars receives less than half the intensity of the\r\nsolar rays that come to the earth, Jupiter only 0.037, Saturn 0.011,\r\nUranus 0.003, and Neptune 0.001.\r\n\r\nIn due time—some hundreds of millions of years—the cooling of the\r\nsun will leave the earth to freeze and all life to become extinct,\r\nunless, perchance, the oxygen of the air is so far absorbed by its\r\nrocks, or filtered away into space, as to destroy life before that\r\ntime. No matter what may be the achievements of the human mind, what\r\nwonderful civilizations may be developed, what powerful empires\r\ncreated, or what wonderful secrets of creation discovered, it seems\r\ncertain that these all will pass away, and finally the surface of\r\nthe earth be as if man never lived. The dust of ages will wipe out\r\nand obliterate every trace and vestige of the operations of life.\r\nSilence, cold, and darkness will then reign supreme. But the time of\r\nthis is indescribably far off in the future, and man will have ample\r\nopportunity to develop to the highest mental and spiritual estates of\r\nwhich he has inherent possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe moon already is dead. If it is formed of matter abandoned by the\r\nearth, as we believe, it once must have had an atmosphere, a portion\r\nof which was absorbed by its rocks as it cooled, and the remainder\r\nlost as the result of the low power of attraction of so small a\r\nbody, which is insufficient to prevent the darting molecules of the\r\ngases of its air from shooting off into space. The absence of an\r\natmospheric covering allows the heat from the sun to escape almost\r\nas rapidly as it is received; and the long nights of the moon (each\r\nas long as fourteen of our days) during which the sun’s rays are\r\nentirely cut off, permit the temperature of the dark side to fall to\r\nsomething like -400° F.\r\n\r\n=How Atmospheres Are Maintained and How Lost.= The processes of\r\nnature are always adding to the various gases of the atmosphere in\r\nsome ways, and transforming or taking from them in other ways. On the\r\nearth the loss and the gain are so nearly equal as to maintain at\r\npresent a nearly constant condition. Marked changes have taken place,\r\nhowever, in long geologic periods. Our early atmosphere probably\r\ncontained large quantities of carbon dioxide which were absorbed by\r\nthe rank vegetable growth that now forms the coal beds of the earth,\r\nand the slowly cooling rocks that constitute the crust took in large\r\nquantities of oxygen; in fact, nearly one half of the weight of the\r\ncrust of the earth is composed of the latter element.\r\n\r\nIn consequence it may be said that our present atmosphere is what\r\nremained after the earth had absorbed its gases nearly to depletion,\r\nand after the lighter gases, like hydrogen and helium, which seem to\r\nhave too great molecular velocity to be imprisoned by the earth’s\r\nattraction of gravitation, had been lost in space. Gases that cannot\r\nbe held by the moon may be imprisoned by the earth and those that can\r\nescape from the earth may be held by the larger planets.\r\n\r\n=Height of the Earth’s Atmosphere.= Exact computation has shown that\r\nif the air were the same density at all elevations, which it is not,\r\nit would extend upward a distance of only five miles. From laws that\r\nare well understood it is known that at a height of thirty miles\r\nthe atmosphere is only about one hundredth as dense as it is at the\r\nsurface of the earth, and that at fifty miles it is too light to\r\nmanifest a measurable pressure. The oxygen ceases at about thirty\r\nmiles and the nitrogen at about fifty miles, the water vapor being\r\nrestricted below the five-mile level. The appearance of meteors,\r\nwhich are rendered luminous by rushing into the earth’s atmosphere,\r\nand whose altitudes have been determined by simultaneous observations\r\nat several stations, reveals the presence of hydrogen and helium at a\r\nheight of nearly two hundred miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA SYNOPTIC PICTURE OF THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nHow much do you know of the great aërial ocean on the bottom of which\r\nyou live and in which human beings are just beginning to fly? Its\r\nvariations of heat, cold, sunshine, cloud, and tempest materially\r\naffect not only the health and happiness of man but his commercial\r\nand industrial welfare, and yet few know more than little of the\r\nwonders of the life-giving medium that so intimately concerns them.\r\n\r\n=At the Height of Two Hundred Miles.= Here is only the invisible,\r\nthe intangible ether which, while too tenuous to be detected or\r\nmeasured by any appliances of man, is supposed to transmit the rays\r\nof the sun. These rays, coming in the form of many different wave\r\nlengths, and with widely differing velocities of vibration, produce\r\na multitude of phenomena as they are absorbed by or pass through\r\nthe air, or as they reach the surface of the earth. The longer and\r\nslower waves are converted into heat, the shorter and more rapid ones\r\ninto light, and the minutest movements probably into electricity.\r\n\r\nOxygen and nitrogen, which form the greater part of the atmospheric\r\ngases, absorb comparatively little of the solar rays, while water\r\nvapor, which constitutes a little more than one per cent. of the\r\natmosphere and which remains close to the earth, absorbs large\r\nquantities. From the fact that one half of the atmosphere, including\r\nnearly all of its water vapor, lies below an elevation of three and\r\none half miles, it becomes evident that the greater part of the\r\nabsorption of the sun’s rays must take place in the lower strata. On\r\nclear days the atmosphere absorbs nearly one half of the sun’s heat\r\nrays; the remainder reaches the surface of the earth, warms it and\r\nin turn is radiated back into the air,—with this difference: that\r\nas earth radiation the wave motion of the rays is longer and slower\r\nthan it was when the rays entered our atmosphere as solar radiation.\r\nIn this slower form the rays are the more readily absorbed. The\r\natmosphere is thus warmed largely from the bottom upwards, which\r\naccounts for the perpetual freezing temperatures of high mountain\r\npeaks, although they are nearer the sun than are the bases from which\r\nthey rise.\r\n\r\n=At the Height of One Hundred Miles.= The temperature at this\r\naltitude must be that of outside space, probably 459° F.[1] below\r\nzero. Air liquefies at 312° below, and therefore it cannot exist in\r\nthe gaseous state in a region having a lower temperature. When it\r\nliquefies it has the color and general appearance of water, and about\r\nthe same specific gravity.\r\n\r\nWhen a piece of steel and a lighted taper are brought together inside\r\nof a vessel filled with liquid air, the dense supply of oxygen makes\r\ncombustion so rapid that the hard metal burns like tinder.\r\n\r\n=At the Height of Fifty Miles.= There is enough air here to refract\r\nlight slightly, as at twilight, and to render luminous the meteors\r\nthat rush with fearful velocity against its widely scattered\r\nmolecules. At this distance from the earth there probably is no more\r\nair than would be found under the receiver of the best air pump,\r\nand, the reader will be surprised to learn, darkness is practically\r\ncomplete, although the hour may be midday, for there are no dust\r\nmotes to scatter and diffuse and render visible the light rays of the\r\nsun. (See Chapter III.)\r\n\r\n=The Darkness of Outer Space.= It may be proven by taking an inclosed\r\nvolume of air, freeing it of dust motes, of which there are millions\r\nper cubic centimeter, and then trying to illuminate it; it will\r\nbe found that no matter how powerful the light directed into it,\r\nit remains wholly dark. When one looks upward on a clear day, he\r\napparently sees the whole universe illuminated; but in point of\r\nfact only the thin stratum of the earth’s air in which he lives is\r\nilluminated. Outer space is practically without temperature or light.\r\nThe rays of the sun do not become either light or heat or electricity\r\nuntil they encounter the molecules of the air, or the invisible dust\r\nmotes, or the cloud particles near the earth and through interference\r\nare transmuted from etheric vibrations into other forms of energy.\r\n\r\n=The Bacteria of Disease and of Putrefaction.= These rapidly diminish\r\nin number with elevation, and on the tops of the highest mountain\r\npeaks practically none are found. Mid-ocean also shows but few.\r\n\r\n=At the Height of Twenty-five Miles.= Air, light as it is, has still\r\nsufficient density to obstruct the passage of the minutest wave\r\nlengths of light, and here probably begins to be appreciable the\r\nblue tint of the heavenly vault. At this short distance from the\r\nearth there must be a deathlike stillness, for there is no medium\r\nsufficiently dense to transmit sound. Two persons could not hear\r\neach other speak, even if they could live in this rare atmosphere,\r\nwhich they could not. Here is eternal peace and no apparent motion,\r\nfor storms and ascending and descending currents cease long before\r\nthis level is reached. The cold is intense and daylight but a feeble\r\nillumination. There are no clouds.\r\n\r\n=Isothermal Stratum Entered at the Height of Seven Miles.= We know\r\nthat the temperature decreases rapidly with ascent—about one degree\r\nfor each three hundred feet—until the top of the storm level is\r\nreached, at about seven miles, when a most wonderful discovery is\r\nmade: the thermometer no longer falls as the aviator rises, or\r\nas balloons float to great altitudes carrying self-registering\r\ninstruments. The temperature remains practically stationary, so far\r\nas exploration has been made, which is to the height of over nineteen\r\nmiles. Major R. W. Schroeder, U. S. A., flew in an aëroplane to\r\n36,000 feet and recorded a temperature of 69° below zero.\r\n\r\nWe have named this region above storms the _Isothermal_ stratum.\r\n(See Figure 1.) Its temperature everywhere is about 70° below zero\r\nand it changes only about six degrees between winter and summer. Of\r\ncourse we must assume that ultimately the temperature shades away to\r\npractically nothing as outer space is reached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—Winter and Summer Vertical Temperature\r\nGradients, in degrees Centigrade and Fahrenheit.]\r\n\r\nScientific and inventive genius is becoming so skillful in harnessing\r\nthe forces of nature to man’s desires that it is reasonable to\r\nanticipate that within a quarter of a century or less human beings\r\nwill be nearly as numerous in the air as insects, they will remain\r\naloft longer, and sail to vastly greater distances and to higher\r\naltitudes. In time dirigible ships may sail for days and possibly for\r\nweeks in the pure air aloft, carrying millions of passengers.\r\n\r\n=At a Height of One and One Half Miles.= There is little difference\r\nin the temperatures of day and night, except that the coolest time of\r\nthe twenty-four hours is during daytime and not at night, as would be\r\nmost naturally supposed. This is important information to an aviator\r\nor to the pilot of a balloon.\r\n\r\n=At an Altitude of One Thousand Feet.= In free air at the hottest\r\ntime in midsummer’s heat, the air is found to be as much as fifteen\r\ndegrees lower than that at the ground. Almost within arm’s length\r\nof the streets of great inland cities there is a cool and healthful\r\natmosphere when humanity is sweltering and dying from heat below.\r\nSome youth who is reading this may develop the genius that will lift\r\nup whole city blocks into this cool and healthful region. Open steel\r\nwork below, the first level at one or two thousand feet above the\r\nhot streets, express elevators to carry passengers, and the climate\r\nof the cool mountain air is accessible to those who now live in\r\ndiscomfort at low populous centers. Man is just beginning to disport\r\nhimself in the hitherto trackless wilderness of the air. Certain\r\nit is that the hanging gardens of Babylon will be outdone in the\r\nTwentieth Century and the eyrie of the eagle left far below by those\r\nwho will live a part of their time in elevated structures having\r\nbases resting upon the earth; or who will fly to great distances\r\naloft and remain at whatever altitude furnishes them the most\r\npleasant and beneficial conditions, and that they may thus remain not\r\nonly for days but for weeks without returning to the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nOnly during recent years have we realized how thin is the stratum of\r\nair next to the earth which has sufficient heat and moisture for the\r\ninception, growth, and maturity of animal and vegetable life. The\r\nraising of the instrument shelter at the New York station of the U.\r\nS. Weather Bureau from an elevation of one hundred and fifty feet\r\nabove the street to an altitude of three hundred feet has caused an\r\napparent lowering of the mean annual temperature of two and one half\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nAir is so elastic and its density diminishes so rapidly with\r\nelevation that nearly one half of the weight of the entire mass of\r\nthe atmosphere lies below the level of the top of Pike’s Peak, which\r\nhas a height of a little less than three miles above sea level. It\r\npresses with a weight of about fifteen pounds per square inch of\r\nsurface, and its pressure is exerted in all directions, upward as\r\nwell as downward. An ordinary man sustains a pressure of over one\r\nton on each square foot of his surface, but as the air penetrates\r\nall portions of his body and exercises a pressure outward as well as\r\ninward he feels no inconvenience. If his body could be so tightly\r\nsealed that no air could enter and if then the air of the interior\r\nshould be removed with a pump, his body instantly would be crushed to\r\na shapeless pulp.\r\n\r\nA cubic foot of atmospheric air weighs one and one third ounces.\r\nWater is 773 times, and mercury ten thousand times, as dense as\r\nair. But air is a more ponderable substance than many suppose; an\r\nordinary lecture hall forty by fifty feet and thirty feet from\r\nfloor to ceiling contains two and one half tons of air at freezing\r\ntemperature. It would contain less at a higher temperature,\r\nbecause heat expands its volume; it would contain more at a lower\r\ntemperature, because cold contracts its volume.\r\n\r\n=Everything Evolved from the Air.= Air is so common that we seldom\r\nstop to consider the magnitude of the force it exerts or the grandeur\r\nwrought by this invisible architect of nature. In the great cycle\r\nof world building—birth from the nebulæ, growth, maturity, decay,\r\ndisintegration, death, and then possibly back again to the nebulæ—the\r\natmosphere, be it light and tenuous as at present, or be it filled\r\nwith the hot vapors of earth and metal, is the vehicle and the medium\r\nof the builder, transporting and transmuting, in mysterious ways and\r\nto wondrous forms, the materials of planets. Its work as a builder\r\nmay be further illustrated by showing that the body of man itself\r\nreturns not to the earth earthy, as we have been taught, but largely\r\nto the air whence it came. Decomposition is but the liberation of\r\nthe aëriform gases of which it is mainly composed; the residue is\r\nbut a handful that goes back to mother earth. Let us take the dried\r\ncorn plant; weigh it, then burn it in a closed vessel so that none\r\nof the ashes can blow away. Continue the burning until the ashes are\r\nperfectly white and it will be found that the weight of the ashes is\r\nonly about one twentieth of the weight of the great stalk, ear, and\r\nfoliage we began with. What has become of all the rest? The fire has\r\ndestroyed it, you say. No, we can destroy nothing. Remember that;\r\nwe can destroy nothing that the Creator has made, neither matter\r\nnor force. The fire has simply changed the form of the plant; the\r\nnineteen twentieths that have disappeared have gone back to the air\r\nwhence they came.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the body of man, the cereal and fruit that furnish\r\nhim food, the structure that gives him shelter, aye, the many things\r\nthat please the eye: the landscape, the beautiful flowers, the green\r\nfields, the babbling brooks, even the rose blush on the maiden’s\r\ncheek,[2]—really come from this wonderful fluid surrounding the\r\nearth, and well may it be said that the queen of life rides upon the\r\ncrest of the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nEXPLORATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\n  DISCOVERIES AS VALUABLE TO THE FUTURE AS THOSE MADE BY COLUMBUS\r\n\r\n\r\nAn entire new world is coming within the range of man’s vision. Its\r\npossibilities for adding to the health and happiness of mankind are\r\nalmost limitless. The geographic poles have been conquered and the\r\njungles of Africa traversed; and deep borings have been made into the\r\nbowels of the earth until heat has arrested further progress. The\r\nfurther exploration of both regions is of the utmost importance to\r\nthe coming age. It is not at all visionary to assume that the heat of\r\nthe earth’s interior in near time will furnish the power necessary to\r\ndo the drudgery of mankind, give warmth and light to habitations, and\r\noperate transportation systems; and the New World Above offers pure,\r\nelectrified, and highly stimulating air into which helium-inflated\r\ndirigible balloons will sail, and in which they will remain not only\r\ndays but weeks or longer, with their multitudes of people.\r\n\r\nWhile the use of kites and balloons in sending automatic\r\nmeteorological instruments far aloft has revealed more of the wonders\r\nof this hitherto uncharted wilderness of cold and partial or total\r\ndarkness than the general public is aware of, only the outer fringes\r\nof the mysterious regions above the clouds and the storms have been\r\npenetrated.\r\n\r\nWhen the manufacture of helium, a noncombustible gas almost as light\r\nas hydrogen, becomes more general, as seems imminent in the United\r\nStates, the dirigible balloon may successfully compete with the\r\nrailroads in the carrying of long-distance passengers. The recent\r\nloss of over forty lives in England by the collapse of the dirigible\r\nZR2 probably was largely if not entirely due to the explosion and\r\nfire of the hydrogen gas with which the ship was inflated.\r\n\r\nA decade ago, in a number of Chautauqua lectures, the writer\r\ninvariably was greeted with looks of incredulity when he prophesied\r\nthat within ten years travelers of the air would take breakfast at\r\nthe Waldorf-Astoria in New York and afternoon tea on the banks\r\nof the Thames. And yet the ocean already has been crossed by an\r\naëroplane in continuous flight, and in the near future it is highly\r\nprobable that aërial navigation will be safer than travel by rail\r\nor automobile. The hitherto inaccessible parts of the earth will\r\nbe sailed over and closely scrutinized, while travelers enjoy the\r\ncomforts that heretofore have been associated with Pullman service.\r\n\r\nIn 1862 the English meteorologist Glashier ascended in a balloon to\r\nabout the same height as that attained by Major R. W. Schroeder,\r\nU. S. A., who achieved a more difficult feat when he flew in an\r\naëroplane to over 36,000 feet. And at Dayton, Ohio, celebrated as the\r\nhome of the Wright brothers, on September 28, 1921, Lieutenant John\r\nA. Macready, U. S. A., reached the unprecedented height of 40,800\r\nfeet. These are the extreme altitudes to which human beings ever have\r\nattained, but they are only the beginning of explorations into a vast\r\nand largely unknown and extremely cold region,—one in which darkness\r\nincreases with elevation until at the outer limits of the atmosphere\r\nno illumination whatever exists.\r\n\r\nThe high eastward wind and 69° below zero encountered by Schroeder\r\nare conditions that already had been revealed by the work done\r\nat the research station of the Weather Bureau, at Mount Weather,\r\nVirginia, and at other stations in this country and in Europe, by\r\nthe sending up of instruments unaccompanied by observers. Under\r\nthe direction of the writer the Weather Bureau liberated numerous\r\nsmall hydrogen gas balloons in the Rocky Mountain region, to which\r\nwere attached automatic instruments registering the temperature,\r\npressure, and the hygrometric conditions. As they came eastward\r\nin the atmospheric drift that always prevails above the storms in\r\nthe middle latitudes they attained to great altitudes, one balloon\r\nreaching 19.1 miles, the greatest altitude ever reached at that time\r\nby the appliances of man. Ultimately the balloons would explode as\r\nthey expanded under the influence of decreasing air pressure and the\r\ncase of instruments would descend slowly under a parachute designed\r\nto open at the right moment. The barometer traced a line on a paper\r\ncylinder revolving by clock works, as did the thermometer. The\r\nthermogram gave the temperature that corresponded with the varying\r\nelevation shown by the tracing of the barogram.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, twelve hundred observations were made with kites by the\r\nobservers of the Weather Bureau at seventeen stations selected\r\nby the writer, during the six warm months from May to October. It\r\nwas surprising to find the temperature often losing as much as\r\nfifteen degrees with the first thousand feet ascent during middays\r\nof extremely hot periods. The average decrease in temperature per\r\nthousand feet elevation for all stations for all times, and at all\r\nelevations up to 5280, was 4°.\r\n\r\nFor over five years kites were used nearly every day in the year at\r\nMount Weather to carry instruments aloft to heights ranging from\r\ntwo to four and one half miles, and at times to keep the apparatus\r\nup during all hours of the day, so that a comparison could be made\r\nof the difference between day and night temperatures. There is but\r\nlittle difference between midday and midnight at only a few thousand\r\nfeet above the earth.\r\n\r\nFew are aware that the rectangular kite of the weather man was the\r\nforerunner of the aëroplane of the aviator. In 1903, while directing\r\nwireless experiments in the sending of messages at Roanoke Island,\r\nNorth Carolina, the writer saw the Wright brothers, or their\r\nrepresentatives, lying flat upon the lower planes of what appeared\r\nto be Weather Bureau kites and gliding in the air from the top of\r\nthe sand dunes. This was the beginning of real flight by man.\r\nThe ingenuity of the Wrights transformed the weather man’s kite,\r\nstrengthened it, took out the ends, hitched on a rudder, and when the\r\npetrol engine had developed sufficient power with a given weight,\r\ninstalled it, and flew.\r\n\r\nIn the future the meteorologist and the aviator will be closely\r\nassociated. With a sufficient number of weather observations made by\r\naviators simultaneously and well distributed over the United States\r\nit will be possible to construct a daily weather map on some high\r\nlevel—say the three-mile level—similar to the map now based upon\r\nsea level. The pressure, temperature, wind direction, clouds, and\r\nrainfall would be recorded and charted for the upper region clear\r\nacross the continent. Three miles is about halfway to the top of\r\ncyclonic storms and probably in the region of greatest activity. More\r\naccurate forecasts would be possible by the study of this additional\r\nweather chart. This coöperation of the bird man and the weather man\r\nin studying the geography of the new air world will mark an epoch in\r\nmeteorological science as far-reaching in its consequences as were\r\nthe discovery of the barometer by Torricelli and the uncovering of\r\nthe principles of the thermometer by Galileo, the former of which\r\nwas not known until more than twenty-three years after the landing\r\nof the Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock. Thus swiftly does the mind of man\r\nto-day explore the hidden recesses of nature’s mysteries, and with\r\neach conquest carry itself to a higher realm of existence.\r\n\r\nIn the not distant future, more storm warnings may be issued by the\r\nWeather Bureau for ships of the air than for those of the sea, for\r\nthe navigation of the air must play an increasing and important part\r\nin the coming activities of the world. Science is becoming so skilled\r\nin the harnessing of the forces of nature to man’s desires and in\r\nthe development of mechanical appliances, that it is reasonable to\r\nanticipate the possibility that long-distance travel over land or\r\nocean ultimately will be almost entirely confined to the air.\r\n\r\nAs the result of the explorations of the atmosphere made by the\r\ninstitution at Mount Weather there was ready for our fighting air men\r\nat the front, immediately on our entry into the World War, a fund of\r\nuseful information concerning a region that but a short time before\r\nwas entirely uncharted. The instruments carried by the exploring\r\nkites and balloons had keen scientific eyes and they recorded on\r\nclock-timed cylinders what they saw. Thus did the air pilot know\r\nmuch about the direction and the force of the wind that he would\r\nencounter as he rose, the altitude where he would pass above clouds,\r\nthe degree of cold that he would encounter, etc. He was told that the\r\ntemperature would fall about one degree for each three hundred feet\r\nof his ascent until he reached the top of the storm stratum at six\r\nor seven miles, and that if he could reach that altitude he would\r\nobserve a most wonderful phenomenon: the temperature no longer would\r\nfall with gain in altitude; he would enter a cold but an equally\r\nheated stratum, without finding any temperatures lower than were\r\nencountered upon entering the region, which is always about seventy\r\ndegrees below zero.\r\n\r\nIf the aërial explorer could stop his ship and keep it at an altitude\r\nof about one and one half miles for twenty-four hours he would be\r\nstartled to find that the coolest time of the period was during the\r\ndaytime, not during the night, as he had expected to find it.\r\n\r\nIn the future the traveler in the upper reaches of the atmosphere\r\nwill carry oxygen and make the kind of air that he wishes to breathe,\r\nand he will properly protect himself against the cold of his new\r\nworld, which he will find deficient in dust motes and doubtless\r\nentirely wanting in the bacteria of putrefaction and of disease.\r\nThere will be no clouds to obscure his vision; no rain or snow. He\r\nwill not often ascend above the region where there are not some dust\r\nmotes to scatter and diffuse a part of the solar rays and give him at\r\nleast a partial illumination.\r\n\r\nFew persons are familiar with the simple problems of the air which\r\nhave such important bearing on the distribution of man into realms\r\nabove those he has been accustomed to occupy. They do not know\r\nthat the northwest wind brings physical energy and mental buoyancy\r\nbecause it has a downward component of motion that draws air from\r\nabove, where it is free of impurities, and where high electrification\r\nhas changed a considerable quantity of its oxygen into ozone, in\r\nwhich condition it remains but a short time after reaching the\r\nlower potential near the earth’s surface. More people die under the\r\ninfluence of the south wind than under the influence of the north\r\nwind, because the south winds hug the surface of the earth and become\r\nladen with impurities and are lacking in electrical stimulation. When\r\ninventive man becomes more familiar with the ocean on the bottom of\r\nwhich he has heretofore lived, he will not wait for the north wind to\r\nbring down to him the beneficial conditions that always exist higher\r\nup; he will go after them and remain aloft as long as he desires to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nThe further development of the dirigible balloon and the aëroplane\r\nare among the most important duties that the engineer of the future\r\nowes to civilization; and the meteorologist must establish the\r\nclimatology of the vast untracked regions above the highest mountain\r\npeaks, for here man will largely disport himself in the time to come.\r\n\r\nThe writer agrees with the opinion of Major William R. Blair,\r\nformerly of his staff when he was the head of the U. S. Weather\r\nBureau, but since the beginning of the World War the chief\r\nmeteorological assistant of the Chief Signal Officer of the U. S.\r\nArmy when he says:\r\n\r\n  “With reference to air travel in the future: the present stage\r\n  of aircraft development seems to indicate that long non-stop\r\n  traffic, both freight and passenger, in the air will be by means\r\n  of lighter-than-air craft (balloons). These craft have much\r\n  larger carrying capacity than any airplanes now designed and\r\n  will travel across the continent over several prepared routes,\r\n  stopping only at important centers on these routes to discharge\r\n  and take up passengers and freight. It is believed that airplanes\r\n  (heavier-than-air craft) will ply between these important centers\r\n  and the outlying country about them, thus acting as feeders to\r\n  the main route, over which the monstrous dirigibles will operate.\r\n  Most transoceanic as well as transcontinental air traffic will\r\n  probably be carried on in these large dirigible balloons.”\r\n\r\nLieutenant Colonel Henry B. Hersey, who served through the World War\r\nin the Aëronautical Service of the Signal Corps, U. S. A., and who\r\nalso was associated with the writer in the management of the Weather\r\nBureau, says:\r\n\r\n  “The fields of the dirigible and the air plane are separate and\r\n  there is no conflict between the two. For light loads, great\r\n  speed, and quick manœuvering, the airplane is supreme. For heavy\r\n  loads, long distance, ability to remain in the air for great\r\n  periods of time, the dirigible is the only air craft that can\r\n  fulfill the requirements. Dirigibles will soon be in use which\r\n  can start from Europe, sail over New York, and drop enough\r\n  poison gas to kill thousands and make practically the whole city\r\n  uninhabitable.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nEARTH’S FOUR ATMOSPHERES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earth has four important atmospheres and others of less\r\nimportance. The principal ones are oxygen, nitrogen, vapor of water,\r\nand carbon dioxide, each comporting itself as it would do if the\r\nothers were not present. There is space between the molecules of\r\neach gas, and therefore it is easily compressed. A doubling of its\r\npressure reduces its volume one half.\r\n\r\n=Composition of Atmospheric Air.= It is difficult for the mind to\r\nform a picture of the infinitely small molecules of the air. Let\r\nus therefore use terms and comparisons that will the more directly\r\nappeal to the human senses. First let us imagine each molecule\r\nenlarged to the size of a small grain of sand. Then with the\r\nmolecules from one cubic inch of air transformed into grains of sand\r\nwe could build a roadway ten feet deep and one hundred feet wide\r\nextending from New York to San Francisco. May one still further grasp\r\nthe idea of the atom, many of which are required to make up the\r\nmolecules? If so, the imagination has been stretched to its limits to\r\nenable the human mind to comprehend some of the simplest facts with\r\nregard to the wonderful fluid in which we live.\r\n\r\nSir William Thomson, afterwards Lord Kelvin, in endeavoring to give\r\nrelative values that would appeal to the imagination, said that if a\r\ndrop of water were enlarged to the size of the earth, the molecules\r\nof which it is composed would be no larger than cricket balls, and\r\nthe smallest about the size of small peas.\r\n\r\nMore than a thousand years before the birth of Christ a great\r\nPhœnician philosopher believed that all matter—solids, liquids, and\r\ngases—was built up from infinitely small aggregations of atoms. The\r\nlearned men of Greece enlarged upon his views but this philosophy\r\npassed into oblivion with the destruction of Rome and the coming of\r\nthe Dark Ages, and it was not revived until about one hundred and\r\nfifty years ago. The ancients could not prove their theory, while\r\nwe to-day can count the atoms and determine their size and motions;\r\nand, exceedingly small though they be, we no longer believe them\r\nto be indivisible in structure. On the contrary, we know that each\r\natom consists of particles of positive and negative electricity.\r\nThe negative electrons arrange themselves about a positive electron\r\nfor a nucleus and, rotating about it as if it were a central sun\r\nwith planets, constitute an atom. All matter reduced to the ultimate\r\nelectron is precisely alike. The difference in matter is determined\r\nby the number of negative electrons that are attracted and held in\r\nplace by the positive nucleus that is at the center of each atom of\r\nwhich a particular kind of matter is composed. Each of the ninety-two\r\nelements which we believe constitute the ninety-two different forms\r\nof simple matter has an atom with its own peculiar type of nucleus,\r\nwhich nucleus differs from those of the others only in the amount of\r\npositive electricity it contains. Thus hydrogen, the lightest of all\r\ngases, whose weight is taken as unity in measuring the magnitude of\r\nother gases, has a nucleus whose positive charge of electricity is\r\nonly sufficient to attract one negative electron. The next element,\r\nhelium, has a nucleus with a double positive charge and consequently\r\nholds two electrons or planets to pay it homage. In like manner\r\nthe carbon atom contains six electrons; oxygen, eight; aluminum,\r\nthirteen; nitrogen, fourteen; sulphur, sixteen; iron, twenty-six;\r\ncopper, twenty-nine; silver, forty-seven; gold, seventy-nine;\r\nmercury, eighty; lead, eighty-two; bismuth, eighty-three; radium,\r\neighty-eight; thorium, ninety; and uranium, ninety-two. The chemical\r\nunion of these elementary forms of matter creates other forms. For\r\ninstance, the union of two atoms of hydrogen and one of oxygen\r\nconstitutes a molecule of water. But the gases of the atmosphere\r\nare not in chemical union; they exist in the form of a mechanical\r\nmixture, each acting as though the others were not present.\r\n\r\nIt is important that this mixture of gases that constitutes our air\r\nbe maintained in the right proportion. Only a slight difference in\r\nrelative amounts might be disastrous to life. An increase in the\r\noxygen would stimulate mental and physical activities and hold the\r\nhuman faculties at a higher tension. Man would accomplish more in a\r\ngiven time, but his span of life would be shortened; and too great an\r\nincrease in the proportion of this stimulating element would quickly\r\nterminate life. Conversely an increase in the nitrogen would render\r\nall life more lethargic and man would be slower to act and to think;\r\nand too great an increase would smother every living thing.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the gases named, the air contains small amounts of\r\nmany other substances,—argon, nitric acid, ammonia, ozone, xenon,\r\nkrypton, and neon; as well as organic matter, germs, and dust in\r\nsuspension. Over the land it contains sulphates in minute quantities,\r\nand over the sea and near the seashore salt left from the evaporated\r\nspray.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of each component of the atmosphere by volume of the\r\ntotal atmosphere is different from its proportion by weight. The\r\npercentages for the more abundant gases are as follows:\r\n\r\n  ===============+=============+===========\r\n                 |  BY VOLUME  |  BY WEIGHT\r\n  ---------------+-------------+-----------\r\n  Nitrogen       |    78.04    |    75.46\r\n  Oxygen         |    20.99    |    23.19\r\n  Argon          |     0.94    |     1.30\r\n  Carbon dioxide |     0.03    |     0.05\r\n                 +-------------+-----------\r\n                 |    100.00   |   100.00\r\n  ===============+=============+===========\r\n\r\n=Nitrogen.= Its principal functions are to dilute the oxygen and to\r\nfurnish food to vegetation. It is inert and does not manifest many\r\nmarked chemical affinities. Its lack of activity is shown by the fact\r\nthat it will neither support combustion nor burn.\r\n\r\n=Oxygen.= Oxygen, unlike nitrogen, is an active element that readily\r\nenters into chemical combination with many other elements, and it\r\nis second in quantity to nitrogen. With hydrogen it constitutes\r\neight ninths, by weight, of water; combined with other elements it\r\nconstitutes forty to fifty per cent. of the crust of the earth. It\r\nburns so readily that were it not greatly diluted by an inert gas\r\nlike nitrogen it would be difficult if not impossible to stop a\r\nconflagration when once started. It is the vitalizing principle in\r\nall forms of life. By its chemical union with carbon in the tissues\r\nof plants and animals it develops the energy manifested in their\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nIn the free air up to about seven miles high there is no variation\r\nin the proportion of oxygen. But variations of marked importance to\r\nhealth and life occur in places where ventilation is restricted, and\r\nespecially where living creatures exist in closed rooms, and where\r\ncombustion occurs in confined places. The following variations in\r\npercentages by volume were found in careful analyses by Robert Angus\r\nSmith: On the seashore of Scotland, 20.99; open places in London,\r\n20.95; in a small room where a petroleum lamp had been burning six\r\nhours, 20.83; pit of a theater at 11:30 P.M., 20.74; in a court room,\r\n20.65; in mine pits, 20.14. He took samples from one mine that showed\r\n18.27, the candles going out when the amount had decreased to 18.50.\r\n\r\nThe absorption of oxygen by putrid matter and by living beings\r\nin the process of breathing, and the giving out of carbon dioxide\r\nby both explain the deficiency of oxygen that is found over large\r\ncities, which is more marked when the air is moving but little and\r\nwhere the city is located in a depression or near swampy lands.\r\n\r\nBoth animals and plants inhale oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide with\r\nthe unchanged nitrogen. The process automatically proceeds both night\r\nand day. It should not be confused with the opposite action of plants\r\nunder the influence of sunlight in taking in and decomposing carbon\r\ndioxide and expelling pure oxygen.\r\n\r\n=Carbon Dioxide.= It forms the chief food supply of all green-leaved\r\nplants. It is as necessary to the life of vegetation as is oxygen\r\nin the supporting of animal life. In the ratio of seventy-seven to\r\none hundred there is less of this gas present in the atmosphere\r\nin the winter than in the summer; there also is a diurnal maximum\r\nand minimum. In the open country the amount averages about 0.035\r\nper cent. by volume. In cities the amount is considerably greater,\r\nfrequently rising to 0.07, and at times to 0.10 when the wind\r\nvelocity is too low to scatter the excess amount that accumulates\r\nnear the ground. Any quantity in excess of 0.06 per cent.,\r\nespecially if combined with the organic matter exhaled from the\r\nlungs and from the pores of the skin by animals and man, is injurious\r\nto health. Angus Smith found as much as 0.32 per cent. in crowded\r\ntheaters, and 2.50 in mines. The latter amount soon would destroy\r\nanimal life.\r\n\r\nVegetation, in addition to the inhalation of oxygen and the\r\nexpiration of carbon dioxide at all hours, absorbs the latter during\r\nthe day, and under the influence of sunlight the green granular\r\nmatter that constitutes the chlorophyll of the cells of the leaves\r\ndecomposes it, the plant retaining the carbon and giving out the\r\noxygen. Because of the absence of sunshine the chemical activities of\r\nthe plant are altered at night and the absorption of carbon dioxide\r\nceases; therefore over the land the maximum amount occurs during the\r\nnighttime. This gas is dissolved in sea water and given off with a\r\nrise in temperature, which causes the maximum amount over oceans to\r\noccur at midday.\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide is 1.50 times as dense as an equal volume of\r\natmospheric air. Its greater density causes it to collect in mines,\r\nsewers, cellars, and other low places, unless there is forceful\r\nventilation.\r\n\r\nThe American cold wave should be welcomed as the mighty scavenger of\r\nthe air. Its high velocity and great density cause it to search into\r\ncracks, crevices, sewers, and cellars and expel foul accumulations.\r\nHow sweet and clean the air smells and how vigorous physically and\r\nbuoyant mentally one feels after a rain and high winds! All nature\r\nsmiles and every form of life adds its pæan of joy. Rain washes\r\nout the carbonic acid gas (carbon dioxide) from the air, with dust\r\nand other particles in suspension; and the cold wave enters our\r\nplaces of habitation and drives out the thieving accumulations of\r\npoisonous gases that would rob us of health and maintain conditions\r\nof morbidity.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be too forcefully stated that oxygen, the life-sustaining\r\nprinciple of the air, decreases, and carbon dioxide, a poison,\r\nincreases in air that is breathed, or in air in which lamps or gas\r\njets are burning; and that all places of habitation, especially\r\nsleeping rooms, should have a continuous supply of fresh air.\r\n\r\n=Water Vapor.= It is only a little over one half as dense as\r\natmospheric air. In the arid regions of the west it may form only a\r\nfraction of one per cent. of the air by weight; while in the humid\r\nregions in the eastern part of the United States it may constitute\r\nas much as five per cent. The temperature being the same, the same\r\namount is required to saturate a given space, whether it be a vacuum\r\nor whether it be filled with air. Air doubles its capacity for water\r\nvapor with each increase of eighteen to twenty degrees. On a hot day\r\nin summer, near large bodies of water, it may constitute as much as\r\none twentieth by weight of the lower air, while on a cold day in\r\nwinter it may form no more than one thousandth part. When the air\r\ncontains all the water vapor it can hold, it is said to be saturated;\r\nno more can be added to it until its temperature is raised, and but\r\na slight lowering of its temperature will precipitate a part of its\r\nwater vapor in the form of dew, frost, rain, hail, or snow. This is\r\nthe reason it is usually called water vapor instead of a gas. Under\r\nthe influence of heat that is below the freezing point, ice and snow\r\nmay be changed from the solid to the gaseous form, and water vapor\r\nmay be precipitated as frost or snow without passing through the\r\nliquid state.\r\n\r\n=The Dew Point= is the temperature of saturation,—the temperature to\r\nwhich a body of air must be reduced before condensation can occur and\r\nsome of its water vapor return to the liquid or solid state.\r\n\r\n=The Relative Humidity= is expressed in percentages of the amount\r\nnecessary to saturate. At a temperature of 32° air may continue to\r\nincrease its vapor of water until it contains 2.11 grains per cubic\r\nfoot, when it will be saturated and its relative humidity be one\r\nhundred per cent. If this same air be suddenly raised in temperature\r\nto 51° its capacity per cubic foot will be increased to twice what\r\nit was at 32°, the 2.11 grains will be equal to only one half the\r\nnumber necessary to saturate, and the relative humidity be expressed\r\nby fifty per cent. instead of one hundred per cent. In this way does\r\nthe capacity of air for water vapor increase. Thus it is seen that\r\nthe relative humidity of the air may increase during the cooling of\r\nnighttime without the addition of any vapor of water, and, in fact,\r\nwith a decrease. The increase of relative humidity after nightfall\r\nis greater in the country than in the city, where the presence of\r\npavements and brick buildings retards the loss of heat.\r\n\r\n=The Absolute Humidity= is expressed in grains the cubic foot. The\r\nhygrometer is employed to measure the amount of water vapor.\r\n\r\n=Hydrogen= is the lightest of all known gases. Its density in\r\ncomparison with ordinary air is only .0692. It is combustible, and\r\nwhen five volumes of atmospheric air are mixed with two volumes of\r\nhydrogen the mixture explodes when ignited. It is supplied to the\r\nair by active volcanoes and in other ways, but the speed of its\r\nmolecules is such that it readily escapes from the earth’s attraction\r\nand passes outward into space.\r\n\r\n=Ozone= (Greek, ozo, I smell) is highly electrified oxygen, in which\r\nthe molecules are broken up and reformed so as to contain additional\r\natoms. It is formed by the disruptive discharge of lightning and by\r\nthe great amount of electricity present in the high levels of the\r\natmosphere, and possibly in minute quantities by the evaporation of\r\nfog and water near the earth. It is always found in the presence of\r\nwaterfalls and spraying fountains. It is a powerful sanitary agent,\r\nreadily entering into union with decaying matter. This fact accounts\r\nfor the total absence of ozone from the air of large cities.\r\n\r\nOzone, in the minute quantities found in nature, is healthful, but\r\nwhen breathed in a condensed form it has a highly irritating effect\r\non the mucous surfaces of the respiratory passages, and the quantity\r\nis not large that will cause death. The healthfulness of mountain air\r\nmay be due largely to the increase with elevation in the quantity of\r\nozone and electricity in the air, as well as to the less number of\r\ndisease germs and dust motes. The invigorating effects of the crisp\r\nair of the frosty morning and of the cold wave in winter may be\r\nincreased by the activities of ozone.\r\n\r\nOzone has two daily maxima, the principal one occurring between 4 and\r\n9 A.M. The minima occur between 10 A.M. and 1 P.M., and between 10\r\nP.M. and midnight. The winter furnishes an amount greatly in excess\r\nof the summer, due not only to the less amount of decaying matter to\r\ntake up the ozone in winter, but to the higher and more persistent\r\nwinds mixing the lower and upper air. The amount is greater over the\r\nsea than over the land, probably due to the absence of oxidizable\r\nmatter, which allows the ozone to accumulate over the water. It is\r\nmore abundant with westerly than with easterly winds, due to the fact\r\nthat westerly winds have a downward component of motion; but if the\r\nwesterly winds be weak and the easterly winds come from over a large\r\nbody of water the conditions may be reversed.\r\n\r\n=Microbes of the Air.= The air transports vast armies of unseen\r\nworkers. Some are enemies; others are benefactors of the human\r\nfamily. The useful varieties are energetic in clearing away the\r\nrefuse of animal and vegetable life, in fixing fertilizing gases in\r\nthe soil, in giving flavor to fruits and proper growth to leguminous\r\ncrops, in transforming the crudest must into the best claret,\r\nand the poorest tobacco leaf into the fragrant Havana; in curing\r\ncheese and butter and fermenting beer, and in a multitude of other\r\nuseful employments. The malevolent varieties, if they gain lodgment\r\nin suitable human tissues before sunlight weakens their virility,\r\ndisseminate certain forms of disease.\r\n\r\nIn picking a permanent place of abode, remember that there are many\r\nless disease microbes in the air of the open country than in that of\r\nthe city, and that few are found in the air of mountains, or in that\r\nof the ocean. The average number of bacteria in a cubic meter of air\r\nin the city of Paris has been found to be 4790, while ten miles away\r\nin the country the number was only 345.\r\n\r\nAccurate analyses of the air of crowded tenements always have shown\r\nlarge numbers of bacteria, but the number was found to be small in\r\nwell-ventilated city houses that let in an abundance of sunshine to\r\ntheir interiors. It is better to have color in the cheeks of the\r\noccupants than in the furnishings of a house. Curtains and heavy\r\ndrapery not only furnish a refuge for the microbes of disease, but\r\nthey may be so hung as to exclude the purifying sunshine. The amount\r\nof sunshine is nearly as important as the quantity of air, for\r\nmost of the microbes of disease quickly die, or are rendered less\r\nvirulent, under its influence.\r\n\r\nBacteria exist in small numbers, if at all, at altitudes where snow\r\nforms, but snow gathers them as it falls through the lower air. Ice\r\ncontains bacteria, but not in any such quantity as the water from\r\nwhich it freezes. Ice forms in the open at the surface of the water,\r\nor about numerous small particles of matter in suspension, which rise\r\nat once to the top as soon as the ice congeals about them in the form\r\nof a buoyant covering; meanwhile sediment is continually settling\r\nto the bottom, carrying bacteria with it. Ice forms more readily in\r\nquiet water, where sedimentation has been most rapid, and where,\r\ntherefore, there are the fewest bacteria in position to be included.\r\nMore disease germs exist in river water in winter than in summer,\r\nwhich may be due to the greater disinfecting power of the sun’s rays\r\nduring summer.\r\n\r\n=Dust Motes of the Air.= As the earth pursues its course about the\r\nsun, dust rains into its atmosphere from outer space. Meteors that\r\nare burned through the heat generated by striking into our air\r\ncontribute to the supply, as do volcanoes, combustion, spray from the\r\nocean, and matter lifted up by the action of the wind.\r\n\r\nDust from the eruption of Krakatoa was wafted entirely around the\r\nearth, falling upon the decks of ships in all the seas of the world.\r\nIt affected the colors of the sky for two or three years after the\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of microbes, the number of dust particles is far\r\ngreater in cities than in the country, being least on high mountain\r\ntops and over the oceans. The air in large cities invariably shows\r\nhundreds of thousands of dust motes to the cubic centimeter, that of\r\nthe village thousands, and that of the open country some hundreds.\r\nDust-free air is also germ-free. Many experiments have shown that\r\nair freed of dust motes has at the same time been cleared of the\r\nmicroörganisms that cause disease, putrefaction, and fermentation;\r\nand that germ-free flesh or liquids may be indefinitely exposed in\r\nsuch air without fermentation or decay.\r\n\r\n=How Dust Motes Are Counted.= Many of the particles are too small\r\nto be seen by the highest powers of the microscope, yet Aitken, by\r\na most ingenious method of making them centers of condensation—that\r\nis, making them the nuclei of small raindrops—was able to count the\r\nnumber in a given volume of air. When ordinary air is saturated\r\nand then cooled the cloud formed is so dense that it is impossible\r\nto count the tiny droplets that form the cloud. But we can make\r\nthe number of dust particles (and therefore the number of visible\r\npoints of condensation) in a given volume of air as small as we\r\nwish by mixing a little dusty air with a large amount of dustless\r\nair, and we can allow the particles to fall on a bright surface and\r\ncan count them by means of a lens or microscope. By simply allowing\r\nfor the proportion of the dustless to the dusty air, and making a\r\ncorresponding allowance for the dilution, we calculate the number of\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\n=Dust Motes and Illumination of the Atmosphere.= One of the most\r\nimportant functions of dust motes is the diffusion or scattering of\r\nsunlight. What a different world this would be without these tiny\r\ninanimate friends of man! If there were no dust in suspension in the\r\nair, nothing would be visible except what received direct light, or\r\nlight reflected from some illuminated surface, and the air occupying\r\nspace between illuminated objects would be practically dark. If the\r\nobserver be in a room with a powerful electric light he would see the\r\nwalls and the objects in the room, but if the air were free of dust\r\nmotes, he would find that the space between him and the walls and\r\nbetween the various objects would be as inky black as is the space\r\nbetween the twinkling stars on a clear night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Showing light from lamp _a_ passing into\r\ndust-free air at _b_, and passing out at _c_ without illuminating the\r\ninterior.]\r\n\r\nFigure 2 is a cubical box, with a glass front. If a glutinous\r\nsubstance be spread over the bottom and the box allowed to remain\r\nquiescent for from five to seven days the dust motes will slowly\r\nsettle down and attach themselves to the bottom. The air then will\r\nbe what is called “optically pure.” Now, if it be taken into a dark\r\nroom and an inclosed lamp at _a_ be allowed to send a beam of light\r\ninto the window at _b_ and out at _c_, it will be found that the\r\ninterior remains dark no matter how powerful the light from the lamp.\r\nThe light is seen to enter and to leave but where it encounters the\r\ndust-free air there is nothing to scatter the light rays and they\r\nremain invisible to the eye.\r\n\r\n=Dust Motes Prolong Twilight.= The bending or refraction of light\r\nas the sun’s rays pass obliquely through the air at sunrise and at\r\nsunset displaces the apparent position of the sun, elevating it by\r\nan amount about equal to its own apparent diameter, so that one may\r\nsee it and receive its light when geometrically it is entirely below\r\nthe horizon. A little later in the evening and its rays fall upon the\r\nupper air too obliquely to be bent down to the earth by refraction;\r\nbut darkness does not yet ensue, for the rays are scattered by the\r\ndust motes and possibly by the molecules of the gases and sent\r\ndownward from particle to particle, resulting in a soft shimmering\r\nlight that almost imperceptibly fades away, and which in higher\r\nlatitudes may last for hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nLIGHT, HEAT, AND TEMPERATURE\r\n\r\n  MORE WONDERFUL THAN ANY FICTION ARE THE FACT OF INVISIBLE LIGHT,\r\n  AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HEAT AND TEMPERATURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heat that escapes from the earth’s interior is minute in\r\ncomparison to that received from the sun, which is the main source\r\nof the earth’s supply. Heat is manifested by the motions of the\r\nmolecules of matter, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous. It is\r\ntransmitted through space in some mysterious manner, for space is\r\npractically void of an atmosphere. One cannot conceive of motion\r\ntaking place in a void, for there is nothing to move. Therefore it is\r\nassumed that interstellar space must be filled with a transmitting\r\nmedium; to this the name of ether has been given. Nothing is known of\r\nits structure, but it is believed that it penetrates all bodies and\r\nfills the space between their molecules.\r\n\r\n=How Heat and Light Reach the Earth.= The heat of the sun is\r\nsome forty-six thousand times as intense as is the heat of the\r\nearth. The violent agitations of the molecules of the sun’s hot\r\natmosphere impart vibrations to the ether of space, which decrease\r\nin effectiveness inversely as the square of the distance; that is\r\nto say, that if the earth were twice as far from the sun as it is,\r\nthe intensity of the solar rays would be one fourth of what they are\r\nnow. These vibrations are called solar energy. They pass through\r\nspace without perceptibly warming or lighting it. When they encounter\r\nthe molecules of the earth’s atmosphere, and the dust and cloud in\r\nsuspension in the air, or impinge upon the solid matter of the earth,\r\nthey are transmuted back into molecular agitations, and manifest\r\nthemselves in a multitude of forms, such as heat, light, chemical\r\nrays, electricity, etc.\r\n\r\n=The Difference between Heat and Temperature.= The agitation of\r\nthe molecules of a substance set up by the absorption of heat is\r\nindicated by temperature, which gives no measure of the quantity of\r\nheat absorbed, the quantity varying widely for different kinds of\r\nmatter. The amount of heat necessary to raise one pound of water\r\n1° F. is the heat unit generally employed in commerce; but in\r\nscientific research the amount necessary to raise one gram of water\r\n1° Centigrade is the unit of heat best adapted to use. It is called\r\nthe gram-calorie.\r\n\r\nLet us take a glass filled with boiling water. You see the glass and\r\nthe water because they reflect to the eye light waves received from\r\nsome source,—possibly the sunlight that is diffused by the dust motes\r\nof the air into the room through the window. But the glass and the\r\nwater radiate other waves to which the eye is not sensible; these\r\ninvisible long heat waves may be felt by the nerves of the hand.\r\nThey warm all matter upon which they fall by adding to the agitation\r\nof the molecules of which it is composed; but they do not warm all\r\nmatter equally. The waves that reach dark bodies are broken up; that\r\nis to say, absorbed. Their energy is transmuted into sensible heat,\r\nand in the place of the waves we have molecular vibrations in the\r\nmatter, which are made manifest by a rise in its temperature. Dark\r\nrough surfaces more completely absorb the waves and therefore rise\r\nto a higher temperature than the same surfaces when smooth. When the\r\nwaves encounter bright and highly polished surfaces the effect is\r\nquite different; then most of them are reflected away and therefore\r\nwarm the matter but little. These reflected waves are not broken up,\r\nbut on the contrary start off in some new direction, possibly falling\r\nupon and warming some matter more receptive to their influence. The\r\nhigher the polish the more completely are the waves reflected.\r\n\r\n=Difference between Light Waves, Heat Waves, and Sound Waves.= The\r\nlight and the heat waves of the ether are infinitesimal ripples as\r\ncompared to the backward and forward pulsations that constitute\r\nthe sound waves of the air. Within a space of one inch there are\r\nsixty-six thousand of the violet waves of light, which are the\r\nshortest etheric vibrations to which the human eye responds, and over\r\nthirty thousand of the red waves, the longest that affect the eye;\r\nwhile the sound waves of the air vary from about one foot for the\r\nshrill notes of the human voice to four feet for the middle C of the\r\npianoforte. A shrill whistle produces waves of about one half inch.\r\nThere are twenty-two thousand of certain heat waves to the inch, and\r\nthese, like some of the light waves of the ether, are invisible.\r\n\r\nThere is also a vast difference between the velocity of vibration\r\nof the air waves and those of the ether. The human ear is sensitive\r\nto sound waves of somewhere between twenty-nine per second to\r\nthirty-eight thousand per second; while the eye responds to light\r\nwaves of from five hundred million to one billion per second. Some\r\nears are better adjusted to the low vibrations and some to the high,\r\nand the ears of no one hear any but a small part of the melody of a\r\ngreat symphony. Tyndall could hear the sharp chirp of thousands of\r\ninsects that were inaudible to his guide as the two climbed the Alps,\r\nbut the guide’s ears responded to the long, slow waves that came from\r\nthe dull tread of the donkey’s hoofs farther up the mountain, which\r\nwaves the scientist was unable to hear. Likewise some eyes are able\r\nto penetrate far into the violet, or the red, or both, and some are\r\nunable to distinguish between certain colors.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Rays of Light.= The chemical or photographic rays\r\nhave still shorter waves than the violet. They produce special\r\nphysiological effects in vegetable and animal tissues, and, acting\r\nupon particular kinds of matter, they cause fluorescence, which\r\nis the property possessed by some bodies of giving off, when\r\nilluminated, light of a color different from their own and from that\r\nof the light that illuminates them. These chemical rays are sometimes\r\ncalled ultra-violet rays.\r\n\r\n=Invisible Light.= From a reading of the immediately preceding\r\nparagraphs one may be prepared for the startling statement that there\r\nis such a thing as invisible light. Vibrations of the ether that\r\nmove slower than those that give to the eye the sensation of red are\r\ninvisible, as are those that move faster than the violet rays, and\r\nit is certain that neither the eye of man nor of animal ever will\r\nsee but a small part of the beauty of a landscape or the delicate\r\ncoloring of a flower. The eye only takes in and renders sensible\r\nto the brain the red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet,\r\nand their various tints, but the delicate instruments of science\r\nreveal many other colors. One sees as through a glass darkly, for the\r\ngentle signals that might reveal the beauties of Paradise fall upon\r\nthe eye unheeded. A keener vision and a more complete appreciation\r\nof the beauties and the wonders of the universe await one on the\r\nother side of the gauzy veil of immortality. The finger tips of the\r\noutstretched arms may span the river of life and the ethereal breath\r\nof loved ones may be caressing one’s cheek. The music of the spheres\r\nis not a myth; the lily or the rose as it opens its petals to receive\r\nthe benediction of the morning sun may give forth a veritable pæan\r\nof joy. A rose bush may be a grander symphony than anything that\r\nBeethoven ever wrote. What to us is the invisible light may be the\r\nillumination that guides the sweep of the angels’ wings.\r\n\r\n=How Heat Moves through or Is Transmitted by Matter.= Heat passes\r\nby contact from the warmer to the colder molecules of a body. This\r\naction is called conduction. When one end of a bar of iron is held in\r\na fire, the end away from the fire soon becomes too hot to hold in\r\nthe hand, because heat is rapidly transferred from the hot portion\r\nof the bar to the cooler portion by conduction, showing that iron\r\nis a good conductor. On the other hand, the end of a stick of wood\r\ncan be held in the fire until it is completely consumed without\r\nthe other end becoming too warm to hold, indicating that wood is\r\na poor conductor. Metals are the best conductors, silver leading\r\nthe list, with copper second. Snow and ice and fibrous and porous\r\nsubstances are poor conductors, and are called insulators. Air and\r\nwater are also poor conductors. The fur of animals and the feathers\r\nof birds protect against the rapid loss of heat because they contain\r\nnumerous interstices filled with air, a poor conductor. Heat is lost\r\nby radiation when the molecules of matter set up vibration in the\r\nether. The atmosphere itself performs this function on a large scale\r\nwhen the sky is cloudless, so that radiated heat is not absorbed by\r\nthe cloud covering and its loss into space restricted. When air or\r\nwater is not evenly or homogeneously heated a circulation is set up\r\nin which the colder part settles down and the warmer rises. This is\r\ncalled convection. The air that is heated by contact with a stove\r\nrises and passes along the ceiling to the colder parts of the room,\r\ngradually parting with its heat until it is no warmer than the air\r\nnext adjacent to it, and slowly settling to the floor as the cold\r\nair beneath it moves toward the stove, is warmed and sent aloft,\r\nthe first air finally making a complete circuit and returning to\r\nthe stove again. In this way the heat is distributed by convection\r\nthroughout the whole room. When one part of the earth’s surface\r\nbecomes hotter than another a similar action takes place on a large\r\nscale. The region of greater temperature warms the air above it, and\r\nthe surrounding denser air flows in along the surface, forcing the\r\nlighter air to rise, when it in turn is similarly warmed and driven\r\nup.\r\n\r\nThe clear waters of lakes and rivers and of the ocean permit the\r\npassage of heat waves to a considerable depth before they are\r\ncompletely absorbed. On a cold day in winter, when the sun is shining\r\nbrightly, a room with spacious windows may become as warm as though\r\nheated by a furnace, simply by the capacity of the glass in the\r\nwindows to transmit the heat waves of the sun without considerable\r\nabsorption, and at the same time prevent the escape of the longer\r\nheat waves that are radiated from the interior walls of the room.\r\nThis capacity of matter to transmit heat waves without absorption\r\nis called diathermancy. The clear atmosphere is an exceedingly good\r\ntransmitter, and rock salt is one of the best of all solids.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of a body to transmit light without absorbing it and\r\nbecoming luminous is called transparency. Air freed of dust motes\r\nis almost perfectly transparent. In this state it is said to be\r\noptically pure. But the ordinary air of nature, with its moisture\r\nand dust, absorbs most of the blue wave lengths and also many of the\r\nlonger ones of the other colors of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of a body for heat is called its specific heat. With\r\nbut few exceptions the specific heats of liquids are much greater\r\nthan those of solids or gases. It requires ten times the quantity of\r\nheat to raise a pound of water one degree that it does a pound of\r\niron. Ice has the greatest specific heat of any of the solids, except\r\nparaffin and wood.\r\n\r\nWhen a solid is melted or a liquid vaporized a large amount of heat\r\nbecomes latent, insensible to the touch; it disappears as heat. This\r\nis one of the most wonderful of the phenomena of nature. It matters\r\nnot how long the time may be, an hour, a day, a year, or a thousand\r\nyears after the solid is melted or the liquid turned to vapor, so\r\nsoon as the vapor returns to the liquid state or the liquid to a\r\nsolid condition, the latent heat becomes sensible in exactly the\r\nsame degree in which it previously existed. Let us illustrate with a\r\npound of ice at zero F. Sixteen heat units, or sixteen times as much\r\nheat as is required to raise one pound of water one degree, must be\r\nabsorbed by this pound of ice to raise its temperature to the melting\r\npoint (32°); and then one hundred forty-four more heat units must be\r\nabsorbed to so far overcome the tendency of the molecules to adhere,\r\nor remain together, that the molecules may roll the one about the\r\nother in the liquid form, but with this important difference: the\r\none hundred forty-four units become latent and do not, therefore,\r\ncause any increase in temperature, as the sixteen heat units did\r\nin raising the temperature of the ice. The large quantity of heat\r\nrequired to change the ice to a liquid is called the latent heat of\r\nmelting. Any further addition of heat after the melting is complete\r\ncauses an increase in temperature, and one hundred eighty heat units\r\nwill raise it to the boiling point. Water boils at 212° at sea\r\nlevel and normal pressure; that is to say, at that temperature the\r\nagitation of the molecules of water is so great as to overcome both\r\ncohesion and the weight with which the air presses down upon them,\r\nand cause them to fly away in the form of steam, which is invisible\r\nwhen confined inside a boiler. But the entire pound of water is not\r\ninstantly changed to the gaseous condition, for with the sending off\r\nof the first few molecules some heat is rendered latent, and more\r\nmust be supplied or the boiling ceases; in fact the enormous quantity\r\nof 964.62 heat units must be supplied to entirely change the pound of\r\nwater to steam, but at no time does the temperature rise above 212°.\r\nAs in the former case of changing the solid to a liquid, a large\r\namount of heat becomes latent; in this case it is called the latent\r\nheat of vaporization.\r\n\r\nNow carefully fix in the mind that a liquid does not need to be\r\nraised to its boiling point before vaporization begins, for it\r\noperates at all temperatures, even after the liquid is frozen, but\r\nmuch more rapidly from the liquid. If one wishes to test this: weigh\r\na piece of ice during very cold weather. Then leave it out in a\r\ntemperature that is below freezing for several days, and on weighing\r\nagain it will be found that the ice has lost weight. All evaporation\r\nproduces a cooling effect because of the heat that is rendered latent\r\nin the process of changing the liquid or the solid to a gaseous form.\r\nThe drier the air the greater is the cooling effected by keeping the\r\nsurface wetted, and the cooling is accelerated by placing the wet\r\nobject where there is a free circulation of air.\r\n\r\nA wooden water bucket that has been soaked for a day or two so\r\nthat every part of the wood is saturated with water, will, if kept\r\nclosed, keep water all day in the open field practically as cool as\r\nwhen it left the deep well, and often cooler. Not enough use is made\r\nof cooling by evaporation by those who have not ice in the summer.\r\nInexpensive and fairly effective refrigerators may be made, by any\r\nmechanic, of lattice-work sides covered with any thick fabric and\r\nkept moist, which would keep milk, butter, fruit, vegetables, and\r\ncooked meats in good condition if placed in a hallway with a good\r\ncirculation of air, or in any shady place with good ventilation.\r\n\r\nMost solids expand with gain in temperature and therefore possess\r\ngreater volume in the liquid form than in the solid, and the\r\ntemperature of their melting points rises as they are subjected to\r\nincreasing pressure. The law reverses when applied to ice, which\r\ncontracts in melting. To few is it known that a skater on ice really\r\nrides upon water molecules, for the sharp edge of the skate, when\r\napplied to the ice under the weight of one’s body, is lubricated by\r\nthe slight melting of the ice in immediate contact with the skate,\r\nthe molecules of water returning to the form of ice as soon as the\r\nskater passes and the pressure is relieved. The strange phenomenon\r\nmay be witnessed by passing a wire through a block of ice without\r\nsevering it into two pieces, by attaching heavy weights to the two\r\nends of the wire and suspending it across the ice, the ice slowly\r\nmelting as the result of the pressure applied by the underside of the\r\nwire and freezing molecules closing the space on top of the wire. By\r\nthis process do we account for the moving of glaciers down tortuous\r\nvalleys as though they were liquids.\r\n\r\n=Altitude Measured by Change in Boiling Point of Water.= The boiling\r\npoint of water at sea level and ordinary air pressure is 212°. If the\r\npressure of the atmosphere were increased to about thirty pounds,\r\ninstead of about fifteen to the square inch it would be necessary to\r\nraise water to 250° before boiling would begin. The changes of air\r\npressure due to the passage of the severe storms of winter may cause\r\nthe boiling point of water to vary from 207° to 215°. This knowledge\r\nmay be useful in measuring the heights of mountains, although the\r\nmethod does not give close results. The decrease of pressure with\r\naltitude lowers the boiling point, the amount being approximately one\r\ndegree for each 555 feet of ascent. The best results may be secured\r\nby having a person at the base of the mountain, where the elevation\r\nabove sea level is known, determine the boiling point at the same\r\ntime that a person on the mountain top does. The thermometers should\r\nbe read closely to the fraction of a degree.\r\n\r\nWith the barometer at its normal height of thirty inches, air at 60°\r\nwill instantly rise to the phenomenal temperature of 175.50 if it be\r\nconfined and its pressure doubled, and it will diminish to one half\r\nof its former volume. But if its pressure be diminished one half, its\r\nvolume will expand to double its original size and its temperature\r\nwill fall from 60° to 2.4°. From these facts the reader would\r\nnaturally expect to find low pressure of the atmosphere accompanying\r\ncold waves and high pressure to be coincident with warm conditions,\r\nwhich is exactly the reverse of what actually occurs in the free air\r\nof nature. This apparent contradiction will be made plain in the\r\ntreatment of cold waves, page 124.\r\n\r\nA temperature of -459° on the Fahrenheit scale and -273.1° on the\r\nCentigrade represents what is called absolute zero. It is supposed\r\nto be the temperature at which there is no motion of the molecules\r\nof matter. Bodies or planets without atmospheres have temperatures\r\napproaching absolute zero, for there is no protecting envelope to\r\nabsorb heat or to prevent the instant radiation into space of that\r\nwhich impinges upon the body. Our moon is an illustration, and\r\nnotwithstanding the fierce beating upon its surface of the solar\r\nenergy it remains incased in the intense cold of space.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer is the instrument that measures temperature. It was\r\nnot until eighty-seven years after Columbus discovered America that\r\nGalileo discovered the principle of the thermometer. This first\r\ninstrument was crude. It consisted of a glass bulb, containing air,\r\nterminating below in a long glass tube, which dipped into a vessel\r\ncontaining colored water. When the temperature fell the contraction\r\nof the air in the bulb caused the water to rise in the tube, and\r\nwhen the temperature rose the expansion of the air forced the water\r\nto a lower level. Galileo also invented the alcohol thermometer in\r\n1611, but the determination of the zero and some fixed point above\r\nit, by which to graduate the scale, took years to evolve. The modern\r\nalcohol and mercury thermometers consist of a bulb filled with the\r\nliquid, and a tube partly filled, the upper part being a tolerably\r\ncomplete vacuum, allowing the liquid freedom of movement up and down\r\nthe tube. When a tube is broken one is surprised to see that the\r\ndiameter of the bore is less than that of the smallest fuzzy hair\r\nfrom the back of the hand. The size of the column of mercury is\r\nmagnified by the action of light passing through the glass of the\r\ntube.\r\n\r\nTemperatures are usually taken in the shade. The instrument should\r\nbe free from all bodies that could conduct heat to it, and it should\r\nhave free circulation of air about it.\r\n\r\nIn a complete meteorological station automatically recording\r\ninstruments, too complicated for the use of the layman, record for\r\neach moment of time the temperature of the air and its pressure, the\r\nperiods of sunshine, the duration and the amount of rainfall, and the\r\ndirection and velocity of the wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE ADVANTAGE OF TAKING WEATHER OBSERVATIONS AND APPLYING THEM TO\r\nONE’S PERSONAL NEEDS\r\n\r\n  FORECASTS MADE FROM THE ANEROID BAROMETER—COLDS PREVENTED BY\r\n  MOISTENING AIR IN LIVING ROOMS—A CRIMINAL HANGED AND AN INNOCENT\r\n  MAN FREED BY WEATHER RECORDS\r\n\r\n\r\n=Observations from Kites.= It is strange that the Chinese, who\r\nhave been flying kites many thousand years, should not have made\r\nimprovements in the primitive construction of these devices.\r\nIt remained for Wendham, in 1866, to perceive the advantage of\r\nsuperimposing two or more planes, one above the other, for the\r\npurpose of securing a larger area of sustaining surface. After\r\nexamining Figure 3 almost any one can build an efficient kite.\r\nHeights of two to three thousand feet may be reached by using\r\ncable-laid twine No. 24, but in order to gain great altitudes\r\npianoforte wire must be used. Soft pine is the best and most\r\navailable material. Spruce is stronger, but more difficult to\r\nsecure. The sticks should be straight-grained. The cloth may be silk\r\nor the stronger and finer grades of cotton. It should be torn, not\r\ncut. The ends will then be true and square with the fiber of the\r\ncloth. Kites are used not only to secure weather observations, but\r\nthey have been used to draw sleds in the Arctic region, and to draw\r\nwagons and boats. By adjusting the points at which the pulling cords\r\nare attached to the boat an ingenious sailor is able to proceed\r\nnearly at right angles to the direction of the wind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—STANDARD WEATHER BUREAU KITE.]\r\n\r\nWhen it is known that a box kite having only sixty square feet of\r\nsustaining surface, flying at a considerable height, may lift a\r\nperson of ordinary size, one is impressed with the idea that vessels\r\nof commerce might employ kites of large dimensions to increase the\r\nspeed of sailing ships. The kites would fly in a stratum whose\r\nvelocity is not restricted by friction with the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nTo launch a kite: run out about one hundred and fifty feet of the\r\ncord or wire while the kite is held by an assistant, who should give\r\nthe kite a toss upward in the direction in which it must go. It is\r\nimportant that it be cast off directly in line with the wind. If the\r\nwind is light it may be necessary to run a short distance with a long\r\nline out in order to effect a launching.\r\n\r\n=Voluntary Weather Observers.= There are more than three thousand\r\nvoluntary or coöperating observers in the U. S. Weather Bureau.\r\nThey receive no compensation other than the publications of the\r\nBureau. They are required to read their instruments but once each\r\nday, as maximum and minimum thermometers record the highest and\r\nthe lowest temperatures since they were last read and set. About\r\nsunset is the most satisfactory time for making the readings, since\r\nthe thermometers will then show both the extremes for the past\r\ntwenty-four hours. As a rule but one voluntary observer is accepted\r\nfor a county. They are furnished without charge with maximum and\r\nminimum thermometers, instrument shelters and rain gauges, but not\r\nwith wind vanes, anemometers for recording direction and velocity\r\nof wind, or barometers. But those who desire to become expert\r\nin forecasting the weather, as all may who study the chapter on\r\nforecasting, should equip themselves with an aneroid barometer, so\r\nthat they may note the changes in the pressure of the air.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—Comparison of the Thermometer Scales.]\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF THERMOMETER SCALES\r\n\r\nA little study of the accompanying information and diagram will\r\nenable any one to form a clear idea of the various thermometer scales\r\nand to convert temperatures from one scale to another.\r\n\r\n_Table of fixed points._\r\n\r\n  -----------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+\r\n    Scale.   | Temperature of | Temperature of | No. of degrees  |\r\n             | melting ice.   | boiling water. | between melting |\r\n             |                |                | ice and boiling |\r\n             |                |                | water.          |\r\n  -----------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+\r\n  Centigrade |       0        |      100       |       100       |\r\n  Reaumur    |       0        |       80       |        80       |\r\n  Fahrenheit |      32        |      212       |       180       |\r\n  -----------+----------------+----------------+-----------------+\r\n\r\nOnly Fahrenheit and Centigrade scales are in general use, and the\r\naccompanying plate is designed to enable observers to convert\r\ntemperature readings from one scale to the other without resorting to\r\na mathematical formula.\r\n\r\nFor accurate and precise reductions between the different scales the\r\nfollowing rules should be used:\r\n\r\n1. To convert Fahrenheit to Centigrade: Subtract 32 and multiply by\r\nfive ninths.\r\n\r\n2. To convert Centigrade to Fahrenheit: Multiply by nine fifths and\r\nadd 32.\r\n\r\n3.

To convert Reaumur to Centigrade: Multiply by five fourths.\r\n\r\nAn instrument shelter (Figure 4) is employed to screen off the direct\r\nand reflected sunshine, and to keep the thermometers dry. This\r\nshelter is a box with louvered sides, constructed in such form that\r\nthere is a free circulation of air through it. It should be exposed\r\nin an open space as far away from buildings as may be convenient,\r\nor on a housetop, and be as free from shadows as possible. If such\r\nposition cannot be secured, then place it on the north side of a\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—Dry and Wet Bulb Thermometers.]\r\n\r\n=Comparison of Centigrade and Fahrenheit.= Only Fahrenheit and\r\nCentigrade are in general use.

Each habitation should be supplied\r\nwith one to several hygrometers (Fig. 6), and frequent readings\r\nshould be taken of the dry and the wet bulb thermometers so as to be\r\nfamiliar with the conditions under which one is living.\r\n\r\n  RELATIVE HUMIDITY TABLES\r\n\r\n  Temperature Readings in Degrees Fahrenheit.

------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----\r\n\r\nA relative humidity of between sixty-five and seventy per cent.\r\nshould be maintained in all living and sleeping rooms, if one is to\r\nescape colds, catarrh, and possibly pneumonia. Some nervous disorders\r\nare aggravated if not actually caused by the dryness of the air in\r\nsteam and other heated apartments during the time that the windows\r\nare closed in cold weather. The vanity of the female sex is appealed\r\nto with the statement that nothing is more essential to securing\r\nand preserving a good complexion than the maintaining of a proper\r\nhumidity in one’s own room. Efficient and simple and inexpensive\r\nhumidifiers are now coming on the market. They are almost as\r\nnecessary to the health of a household as stoves and furnaces. Often\r\na right degree of moisture can be created by leaving clean water in\r\nthe bathtub and in all wash basins and sinks. One may be surprised\r\non taking humidity observations to find how quickly it increases in\r\nrooms two or three removed from the bathroom after water is run into\r\nthe tub, and especially if the shower spray is turned on and allowed\r\nto operate for a few minutes.\r\n\r\nIn cold weather we maintain the aridity of the Sahara Desert in\r\nour hot, steam-heated apartments, with a relative humidity of less\r\nthan thirty per cent. Is it any wonder that when we step from this\r\natmosphere into the cold outside air, with a humidity of seventy per\r\ncent., the violent change is productive of harm, particularly to the\r\ndelicate mucous membranes of the upper air passages, which have been\r\nirritated and their powers of resistance weakened by the dryness\r\nwithin? The period of pneumonia is the season of artificial heat in\r\nliving rooms—or, more properly speaking, the period of indoor desert\r\naridity.\r\n\r\n=Save Fuel by Moistening Air.= If a room at 68° is not warm enough\r\nfor any healthy person it is because the humidity is too low, and\r\nwater should be evaporated to bring the moisture up to sixty-five or\r\nseventy per cent. of saturation. Water instead of coal should be used\r\nto make rooms comfortable when the temperature has reached 68°. Ten\r\nto fifteen per cent. of fuel could be saved in the heating of places\r\nof habitation if the air were properly and healthfully humidified.\r\nThe reason for this is that if the air is dry the heat passes through\r\nit and warms it but little. Moisture stops the radiated heat that\r\nwould be lost, absorbs it, and holds it at the place where it is\r\nneeded. It has precisely the same effect as a soft wool blanket\r\nwrapped about the body of each person. The dry air permits such a\r\nrapid evaporation from the human body that one may actually feel\r\ncolder with a dry air heated to 75° than in a moist air at 66°\r\nor 68°. Water is cheaper than coal, and in this matter much more\r\nhealthful.\r\n\r\nThe cooling effect produced by a draught does not necessarily arise\r\nfrom the wind being cooler, for it may be actually warmer, but arises\r\nfrom the rapid evaporation it causes on the surface of the skin.\r\nVapor of water forms a blanket about the earth and prevents it from\r\nscorching during the day and freezing during the night.\r\n\r\n=How to Forecast Weather with Only an Aneroid Barometer.= No one\r\nexcept an expert observer should use the mercurial barometer. The\r\naneroid will answer as well for the purpose of forecasting from a\r\nsingle instrument; it is cheaper and less complicated. First learn\r\nyour elevation above sea level; then add to the observed reading of\r\nyour instrument .10 for each one hundred feet elevation. Note the\r\nfall or rise and the direction of the wind and with the aid of the\r\ntable on page 76 highly satisfactory forecasts may be made by any\r\nintelligent person. Skill will come with practice. Write down your\r\nforecasts each day as you make them and the following day note in\r\na blank space left for the purpose the success or failure of your\r\neffort. Thus will you profit by your mistakes.\r\n\r\nAs a rule winds from the east quadrants and falling barometer\r\nindicate foul weather, and winds shifting to the west quadrants\r\nindicate clearing and fair weather. The rapidity of the storm’s\r\napproach and its severity are indicated by the rate and the amount in\r\nthe fall of the barometer. This applies to the Mississippi Valley and\r\neastward to the Atlantic Ocean. Conditions are different in the Rocky\r\nMountains, on the plateau of the mountains, and on the eastern Rocky\r\nMountain slope, where precipitation seldom begins until after the\r\nbarometer begins to rise after a fall, and the winds have shifted to\r\nthe northwest.\r\n\r\nKeep in mind that storms are great atmospheric eddies drifting from\r\nthe west, with the winds blowing cyclonically toward the center; that\r\nwhen your wind is northeast the center of the storm is southwest of\r\nyou; that when it is east the center is west; when it is south the\r\ncenter is north; when it is southwest the center is northeast, and\r\nwhen it is west or northwest the center is east of you.\r\n\r\n  ===========+====================+====================================\r\n     WIND    | BAROMETER REDUCED  |        CHARACTER OF WEATHER\r\n   DIRECTION |   TO SEA LEVEL     |             INDICATED\r\n  -----------+--------------------+------------------------------------\r\n  SW. to NW. |30.10 to 30.20 and  |Fair, with slight temperature\r\n             |  steady.           |  changes, for 1 to 2 days.\r\n  SW. to NW. |30.10 to 30.20 and  |Fair, followed within 2 days by\r\n             |  rising rapidly.   |  rain.\r\n  SW. to NW. |30.20 and above and |Continued fair, with no decided\r\n             |  stationary.       |  temperature change.\r\n  SW. to NW. |30.20 and above and |Slowly rising temperature and fair\r\n             |  falling slowly.   |  for 2 days.\r\n  S. to SE.  |30.10 to 30.20 and  |Rain within 24 hours.\r\n             |  falling slowly.   |\r\n  S. to SE.  |30.10 to 30.20 and  |Wind increasing in force, with rain\r\n             |  falling rapidly.  |  within 12 to 24 hours.\r\n  S. to SW.  |30.00 or below and  |Clearing within a few hours, and\r\n             |  rising slowly.    |  fair for several days.\r\n  S. to E.   |29.80 or below and  |Severe storm imminent, followed,\r\n             |  falling rapidly.  |  within 24 hours, by clearing, and\r\n             |                    |  in winter by colder.\r\n  SE. to NE. |30.10 to 30.20 and  |Rain in 12 to 18 hours.\r\n             |  falling slowly.   |\r\n  SE. to NE. |30.10 to 30.20 and  |Increasing wind, and rain within\r\n             |  falling rapidly.  |  12 hours.\r\n  SE. to NE. |30.00 or below and  |Rain will continue 1 to 2 days.\r\n             |  falling slowly.   |\r\n  SE. to NE. |30.00 or below and  |Rain, with high wind, followed,\r\n             |  falling rapidly.  |  within 36 hours, by clearing,\r\n             |                    |  and in winter by colder.\r\n  E. to NE.  |30.10 and above and |In summer, with light winds, rain\r\n             |  falling slowly.   |  may not fall for several days.\r\n             |                    |  In winter, rain within 24 hours.\r\n  E. to NE.  |30.10 and above and |In summer, rain probable within\r\n             |  falling rapidly.  |  12 to 24 hours.

A room twenty by twenty by ten feet contains some 333 pounds of\r\nair. The pressure of the air is a quite different thing. It is the\r\nsum of the weights of all the cubic feet of air that are stacked up,\r\none on top of the other, clear to the top of the atmosphere. This is\r\nwhy the higher one goes, the less the pressure of the air, because\r\nthere are a less number of cubic feet above. And then each cubic foot\r\nweighs a slight fraction less than the one just beneath it because\r\nthe air has expanded. The room afore-mentioned sustains a pressure\r\nof 5880 on its floor and a like pressure on its ceiling, and a half\r\nof this pressure on each of the sides of the room. The room does not\r\ncollapse because the air exerts a like pressure on the outside of the\r\nroom and the two pressures are equal—one inward and the other outward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—Mercurial Barometer. The glass tube on right\r\nis filled with mercury. With the thumb over the open end, it is\r\nreversed so that its open end rests under the surface in a basin of\r\nmercury on the left, and the mercury in the tube falls to _n_, at\r\nwhich point it is sustained by pressure of the air on surface of the\r\nmercury in the basin.]\r\n\r\n=The Principle of the Barometer.= In 1643 some Florentine gardeners\r\nfound that they could pump water only thirty-three feet high. This\r\nis because the entire volume of air, if it were compressed to the\r\ndensity of water, would equal a covering around the earth of that\r\ndepth. When the gardeners first began to work the plungers in their\r\npump up and down they did not get water; it was necessary for them\r\nfirst to pump out all the air in the pipe leading down to the water\r\nin the well; then the water rose into the vacuum thus created, and\r\nit rose to a height that just balanced the weight or pressure of the\r\nwhole body of air that rests upon the earth. Now, if the atmosphere\r\nsurrounding the earth could be reduced to the density of mercury\r\nit would equal a covering only thirty inches deep; this is why\r\nthe mercury normally stands at thirty inches high in the vertical\r\nvacuum tube of the barometer. (Figure 7.) In the complete barometer\r\na graduated scale is attached so as to measure the fluctuations in\r\nthe height of the mercury. If one were to ascend in a balloon it\r\nwould be found that the mercury would steadily fall with increasing\r\naltitude, until at eighteen thousand feet one half of the atmosphere\r\nwould be left below and the instrument would read only fifteen\r\ninches instead of thirty. In ascending to the top of the Washington\r\nMonument, 555 feet, the pressure of the air decreases over one half\r\ninch.\r\n\r\nThe barometer rises and falls with the passage of storms because wind\r\nmovement displaces air and causes it to accumulate at some places\r\nand become deficient at others, but in order to compare barometers\r\nexposed at many different elevations with the view of determining the\r\ngeographic position of storm centers—of cyclones and anti-cyclones—it\r\nis necessary to reduce all barometric readings to sea level.\r\n\r\n=Weather Records Turn the Scales of Justice.= How trivial the\r\nincident that may change the whole course of a lifetime and lead to\r\npeace and happiness or to discord and sorrow! Likewise the parting of\r\nthe clouds and the coming through of the sunshine, or the moment of\r\nthe beginning of rainfall, or the amount of rain that falls within\r\na given time, or the direction of the wind, or the velocity of the\r\nwind, or the temperature of the air, or the depth of the snowfall\r\nliterally thousands of times has furnished the evidence in courts of\r\nlaw that has turned the scales of justice in civil suits involving\r\nlarge sums of money, and in criminal cases where a prison sentence or\r\nthe hangman’s noose threatened the defendant.\r\n\r\nFor illustration let us say that a ship breaks from its mooring,\r\ncrashes into another ship in the harbor and sinks it. If the force of\r\nthe storm is no greater than has previously occurred in that harbor,\r\nthe first ship is liable for the loss of the second ship. But if the\r\nautomatically recording instruments of the Weather Bureau show that\r\nat that time the velocity of the wind was greater than ever had been\r\nknown before, then the loss is due to “an act of God” and the ship\r\nthat broke her mooring is not liable for damages to the ship that was\r\nsunk, provided proper provision was made for such velocity of wind as\r\nreasonably might be expected to occur with the passage of a storm.\r\n\r\nTo cite a case that actually occurred: A railroad company was sued\r\nfor the loss of a million dollars’ worth of lumber that was burned,\r\nas alleged, by sparks from one of its locomotives. Here came in the\r\nwind records of the Government and proved that at the time of the\r\nstarting of the fire the wind was steadily and forcefully blowing in\r\na direction opposite to what would carry the sparks to the lumber,\r\nand the company was protected against an unjust verdict.\r\n\r\nAgain heavy rain fell in excess of the capacity of the sewers of a\r\ncity to carry away the water, and private property was damaged by\r\nthe flood. In this case the city was compelled to pay for the damage\r\nto property, because the records of the Weather Bureau showed that\r\nprevious rainfalls had been of equal or greater amount in the same\r\nperiod of time, and the city should have constructed its sewers of\r\nsufficient capacity to carry away such precipitation as experience\r\nshowed was liable to occur.\r\n\r\nThe writer was once an expert witness in what then was a famous case.\r\nThe defendant, a young and handsome woman previously of unimpeachable\r\ncharacter, was being sued for divorce. Two witnesses swore that they\r\nhad seen her come to an open window, facing south, at seven o’clock\r\nin the morning, in a house in which she should not have been, stand\r\nfor several minutes looking into the garden upon which the window\r\nfaced, clad only in her night robe. Unfortunately the woman was not\r\nable to establish a satisfactory alibi for the morning in question,\r\nand she stood facing a terrible calamity with no power to establish\r\nher innocence. Her accusers had given as a reason why she stood so\r\nlong at the open window that the morning was warm and balmy. But,\r\nfortunately for the innocent woman, the weather records came to her\r\ndefense when her case seemed hopeless and her life was about to be\r\nblighted with a scandal from which she never would be able to free\r\nherself, and proved that at the very time when she was supposed to\r\nhave been standing in the open window a torrential rain was falling\r\nand a wind of fifty miles per hour was beating upon the outside of\r\nthe window panes. The woman was acquitted and one of the witnesses\r\nspent several hundred balmy mornings behind prison bars.\r\n\r\nAt another time the writer came into a case where a robber had\r\nshot and killed a citizen who surprised him in the committing of\r\nhis crime. The robber was on trial for murder and his lawyers were\r\nattempting to clear him by the introduction of evidence to prove that\r\nthe day was so foggy that the State’s witnesses had blundered and\r\nseized the wrong man when they chased the murderer around a corner.\r\nThe weather expert destroyed the only evidence that tended to raise\r\na doubt in the mind of the jury as to the man’s guilt, by testifying\r\nthat fog could come to the surface of the earth only when the air\r\nwas abnormally light and the wind calm or only gentle; while at the\r\ntime of the murder the barometer was unusually high and the wind\r\nbrisk. Here again the meteorological records aided in vindicating the\r\nright, and secured the conviction and execution of a brutal murderer.\r\n\r\nA remarkable case was that in which a tramp was being tried for the\r\nmurder of a miserly old woman who was believed to carry a large\r\namount of money about her person. The tramp came to her door and\r\nasked for food. She took him in and fed him and soon thereafter\r\nhe was seen hastily to leave the house. An hour after he had gone\r\nthe woman was found murdered and her clothing rifled. The tramp\r\nwas overtaken, found to have a large amount of money of small\r\ndenominations in his pockets, indicted, and placed on trial. The\r\nprincipal witness for the State was a man who was repairing a frozen\r\nwater pipe in a trench by the side of the house opposite to that by\r\nwhich the tramp entered and left. He saw the blow struck, ran in\r\nfear to his home, and then informed the police. In explaining how he\r\ncame to see the criminal act, he testified that he climbed out of\r\nthe trench to get a drink from a bucket standing near by, and as he\r\nraised the bucket his eye came in line with a window of the house,\r\nthrough which he witnessed the murder. The case seemed clear against\r\nthe tramp, as other witnesses had seen him enter and leave the house\r\nand positively recognized him. Just here his lawyer asked the trench\r\ndigger how long the water bucket had been sitting by the side of\r\nthe trench. The latter said it had been there from 7 o’clock until\r\n10. Then the weather records came in to confound the falsifier and\r\nto vindicate innocence, for the automatic tracing of the pen that\r\nrecords every movement of the temperature proved that the temperature\r\nhad not been above zero any time during the three hours that the\r\nbucket had been exposed and that it contained a solid chunk of ice\r\nif it contained anything. The trench digger then confessed that he\r\nhimself was the murderer. He had seen the tramp enter and leave and\r\nthought it a favorable opportunity to commit the crime and put the\r\nevidence on another.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFROST\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the study of the atmosphere that so intimately\r\nconcerns the horticulturist and the gardener as knowledge of the\r\nconditions under which frost forms, and the methods that may be\r\npursued to gain immunity from its disastrous effects, or to lessen\r\nthe loss.\r\n\r\nFrost does not necessarily form from air that has fallen to the\r\nfreezing point, as many suppose. On the contrary, the air ten feet\r\nor less above the vegetation may be several degrees above freezing\r\nwhen there is a heavy and destructive frost upon vegetation. The fact\r\nis that vegetation radiates heat towards a clear sky faster than\r\ndoes the air and may fall to the freezing point or below; while the\r\nair, except the molecules actually in contact with the vegetation,\r\nis considerably warmer. Frost is not frozen dew. The water vapor\r\nis precipitated, or rather congealed, upon the vegetation without\r\npassing through the liquid state at all. Frost is spoken of as light,\r\nheavy, and killing. Tomato plants are killed by only a light touch of\r\nfrost, while fruit blossoms will stand several degrees of cold below\r\nfreezing. Therefore the tomato grower would consider as killing a\r\nfrost that to the fruit grower would only appear as light.\r\n\r\nThe radiation of heat from the earth is continuous both day and night\r\nwhen there are no clouds to obstruct the passage of the heat rays.\r\nThe amount received from the sun during the day is greater than the\r\nloss by radiation from the earth and the temperature of the air\r\nrises. After the setting of the sun the radiation of the earth goes\r\non but there is no incoming heat from the sun to offset the loss and\r\nthe temperature of the air falls. As previously stated, the soil\r\nand vegetation radiate faster than the air and the air in immediate\r\ncontact with the soil is cooled by conduction to it. Thus over a\r\nlevel plain on a clear calm night there is found a relatively thin\r\nlayer of cold air near the ground, which increases in temperature\r\nup to two hundred or three hundred feet, or which may be only five\r\nor ten feet deep. Over sloping ground the force of gravity tends to\r\ncause this thin surface layer of cold air to move down the slope and\r\nto gather in depressions in somewhat the same manner as water would\r\nmove. Such movement is called Air Drainage. Of course this air is\r\nslowly gaining heat by compression as it passes to lower levels, but\r\nit is hugging closely to the cold earth and losing by conduction much\r\nor all that it thus gains by compression.\r\n\r\nAfter a study of the contour of the region with respect to air\r\ndrainage the writer purchased a considerable tract of land near\r\nRockville, Montgomery County, Maryland, and planted extensive\r\norchards thereon, with the result of harvesting nine successful crops\r\nof fruit in a period of ten years after the trees became large enough\r\nto bear. With the composition and the surface covering of the soil\r\nthe same, the low places in a field are always the ones that suffer\r\nmost when frost is possible. Figure 8 shows a minimum temperature\r\nof 25° to have occurred at the base of a steep hillside when on\r\nthe higher ground at an elevation of but fifty feet the lowest\r\ntemperature was 44°, and at two hundred and twenty-five feet up the\r\nmountainside the minimum was 52°.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.—Continuous records of the temperature from 4\r\nP.M. to 9 A.M. at the base and at different heights above the base of\r\na steep hillside, showing the great differences in temperature that\r\nsometimes develop on a clear, still night. Although the temperature\r\nat the base was low enough to cause considerable damage to fruit, the\r\nlowest temperature 225 feet above on the slope was only 51°. Note\r\nthat the duration of the lowest temperature was much shorter on the\r\nhillside than at the base.—_Weather Bureau._]\r\n\r\nIn selecting a location for an orchard it is not so much a problem of\r\nelevation above sea level as elevation above the surrounding region.\r\nThe direction in which the slope faces makes little difference. The\r\nprime consideration is to get sufficient air drainage to gain the\r\ngreatest protection against frost without selecting land with such a\r\nsteep slope as to furnish excessive soil drainage and which would be\r\ndifficult to cultivate and move about upon in the spraying of trees\r\nand in the picking of fruit. In the Maryland orchard the elevation\r\nwas only five hundred feet above sea level and only about two hundred\r\nfeet above the surrounding region, and the slope was so gradual as\r\nalmost to be imperceptible to one passing over it.\r\n\r\nAfter nightfall the air on mountain peaks and on hills and ridges\r\nsoon becomes cooler than the air at the same elevation out over the\r\nopen valley, due to contact with the elevated earth, which radiates\r\nheat and cools faster than the air.\r\n\r\nWater vapor has a great capacity for heat. It is the most effective\r\nof the various gases present in the atmosphere in obstructing\r\nradiation of heat from the earth, as well as in absorbing incoming\r\nradiation from the sun. The night temperature, therefore, falls\r\nmore slowly when the relative humidity is high than when it is low,\r\nthat is to say, when the air is nearer saturation, or nearer its\r\ndew point. Drops of water that collect on the outside of a pitcher\r\nof ice water on a warm day are formed through the chilling of the\r\nair in contact with the pitcher; they begin to form as soon as the\r\ntemperature of the pitcher reaches the dew point of the air, which\r\ntemperature varies in accordance with the amount of water vapor\r\npresent in the air at the time. After sundown the temperature of\r\nexposed objects falls, of some faster than others, depending on\r\ntheir capacities for radiation. Vegetation radiates freely and often\r\nfalls to the dew point of the air, at which time dew begins to\r\nform on it and continues to be deposited as long as the temperature\r\nremains above freezing. Now, here carefully note that if the dew\r\npoint is above 32° the condensation of water vapor in the form of\r\ndew liberates latent heat, which usually will be sufficient to check\r\nthe fall of temperature and prevent the formation of frost. If the\r\ndew point of the air is 32° or lower frost forms. If the dew point\r\nis very low the temperature may fall low enough to cause much damage\r\nwithout the formation of any frost. As an example, if the dew point\r\nbe 20° and the temperature falls to 24° much damage might be done to\r\ngrowing crops and no frost appear. This phenomenon is called black\r\nfrost; it seldom occurs. From the foregoing it might be assumed\r\nthat the possibilities of frost might safely be forecast from an\r\nobservation to determine the relative humidity taken early in the\r\nevening, but unfortunately experience has shown that reliance cannot\r\nbe placed in such method of forecasting, as the humid air of early\r\nevening may be displaced by much drier air before the hour of minimum\r\ntemperature the next morning.\r\n\r\nOne of the best locations to gain immunity from frost at the\r\ncritical period of plant growth is immediately to the leeward of a\r\nconsiderable body of water. Wind blowing from a large body of water\r\nis always heavily laden with moisture, which decreases the rate of\r\nradiation both day and night, but especially during the period of\r\ncold in the early morning when frost is liable to occur. Such winds,\r\nlargely affected by the temperature of the water over which they have\r\npassed, modify the temperatures of both day and night.\r\n\r\nThe all-important condition for the formation of frost is an\r\natmosphere already cool, with a gentle northwest wind and a clear\r\nsky, which condition, with more or less coolness, always accompanies\r\nthe high barometric areas that follow the low-pressure areas of\r\nwarmth, cloudiness, and moisture.\r\n\r\nAt an expense of two millions of dollars per annum the Government\r\nmaintains some two hundred observation stations of the Weather\r\nBureau, and twice daily telegraphs observations to all the large\r\ncities of the nation, but unfortunately in many cases these are not\r\npublished for the benefit of the people who could make valuable use\r\nof them. The Bureau’s own deductions from these observations, in the\r\nform of forecasts and warnings, are extremely valuable, but an even\r\ngreater service could be rendered the public by neatly lithographing\r\nan evening weather map and mailing it from all large cities each\r\nnight, so that every intelligent person whose business is affected\r\nby the weather could, through a study of the chapter on Forecasting\r\nin this book, judge for himself as to the effect that the coming\r\nweather may have on his particular interests. One could then watch\r\nthe movements of the high barometric areas and the low areas and\r\nbecome weatherwise himself, and he who studied these charts the most\r\ndiligently would have an advantage over less progressive competitors.\r\n\r\nEvaporation goes on at all temperatures, even below freezing and from\r\nsolid ice, its rate, of course, being diminished by low temperatures.\r\nAt times, in spring or fall, the temperature of the air over rivers,\r\nwhen there is little wind, falls so far below the temperature of\r\nthe water that the water vapor rising from the river by evaporation\r\nis quickly condensed in the form of fog, which may cover a part or\r\nall of the low contiguous land, checking radiation and preventing a\r\nfurther fall in temperature.\r\n\r\nIn valleys near the ocean, fog sometimes drifts in from the water\r\nwhen frost is imminent and prevents its formation. On nights with\r\nfog, contrary to the usual condition, the hillsides are always colder\r\nthan the lowlands, unless the fog extends high enough to cover them.\r\n\r\nIn 1891-1894 the writer, in studying the conditions under which\r\nfrost forms on the cranberry bogs of Wisconsin, was impressed with\r\nthe fact that the occurrence of frost on a given field depended as\r\nmuch on the character of the surface and its covering as it did on\r\nthe temperature of the air a few feet above, one place receiving\r\nan injurious frost, another a light frost, and still another none\r\nat all, while each had the same conditions as to temperature, wind\r\nvelocity and direction, and all were at the same elevation, so that\r\nthe differences could not be accounted for by air drainage.\r\n\r\nIn one case the marsh was cleanly cultivated and covered with sand,\r\nin another there was clean cultivation but no sand, and in still\r\nanother case there was a thick growth of vegetation. As the result\r\nof a long series of observations conducted by Professor H. J. Cox,\r\nworking under the directions of the writer, minimum thermometers were\r\nplaced among the vines over newly sanded surfaces in two marshes,\r\none at Cranmoor and one at Mather, Wisconsin. The locations selected\r\nfor this inquiry represented the best results that could be secured\r\nfrom sanding, draining, and cultivating. Comparison was made at each\r\nmarsh between the readings taken close to the vines of the clean part\r\nof the marsh and those taken close to the surface over the unsanded\r\npeat bog. The average lowest night temperature over the sand for the\r\nfour months was 5.9° higher than over the peat at Cranmoor, and 4.2°\r\nat Mather. On one night the minimum over the surface at Cranmoor was\r\n12° higher than over the peat, while at Mather a difference of nine\r\ndegrees was recorded on another night.\r\n\r\nThrough cultivation the marsh may be kept free from weeds, moss,\r\nor other rank growth, thus permitting the sun’s rays to reach the\r\nsoil and increase its temperature during the day, while a growth of\r\nthick vegetation screens the soil from the sun’s rays, and there is\r\nconsequently less heat in the latter soil to be given out during\r\nthe hours of low temperature at night. Drainage lowers the specific\r\nheat of the soil and decreases the cooling effect of evaporation.\r\nTherefore, under sunshine, the dry soil becomes warmer than the wet\r\nand, whether or not it has a greater quantity of heat to give off\r\nat night, it has a higher temperature and therefore radiates more\r\nfreely to the air above. A covering of sand likewise lowers the\r\nspecific heat of the surface and thereby causes it to gain a higher\r\ntemperature during the day than an unsanded surface receiving the\r\nsame solar rays. It therefore radiates more rapidly at the critical\r\ntime when heat is needed to prevent the temperature of vegetation\r\nfrom falling to the freezing point and gaining a deposit of frost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—Continuous records of the temperature 5\r\nfeet and 35 feet above ground on a tower in a pear orchard. Note\r\nthe large difference in temperature at the two levels before the\r\norchard heaters were lighted at 4 A.M. By 5 A.M. the temperature\r\nwas practically the same at the two levels, showing that the heat\r\nfrom the burning oil had been nearly all expended in raising the\r\ntemperature of the air within 35 feet of the ground. This point is\r\nfurther illustrated by the fact that at 5 A.M. when most of the\r\nheaters were extinguished, the temperature at the 5-foot level fell\r\nrapidly, while it remained practically stationary at the 35-foot\r\nlevel.—_Weather Bureau._]\r\n\r\nIn many orchards in the Rocky Mountain States, where fruit growing is\r\nhighly profitable and the injury from frost more than probable every\r\nyear, an extensive use is made of oil and other fuel-burning heaters\r\nbetween the rows of trees. Those who wish further information with\r\nregard to this matter should send to the Weather Bureau, Washington,\r\nD. C., for Farmers’ Bulletin No. 1096. At first thought it would\r\nseem that heat so applied would be blown away or instantly escape\r\nupward. But on frosty nights there is not much wind; if there is,\r\nthere is little danger from frost. And then, as previously stated,\r\non such nights there is what is called temperature inversion, and\r\nthe temperature actually rises with the first few feet of ascent,\r\nand the heated air soon reaches air of its own temperature, when no\r\nfurther ascent occurs. When the air forty feet from the ground is\r\nten degrees warmer than it is around and in contact with vegetation,\r\nas often occurs on frosty nights, the heat from the fires is nearly\r\nall expended in raising the temperature of the air within this forty\r\nfeet. Figure 9 furnishes the result of an experiment illustrating the\r\ncorrectness of the foregoing theory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—Average dates of last killing frost in\r\nspring.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—Average dates of first killing frost in fall.]\r\n\r\nFigures 10 and 11 show the average dates of the last killing frost in\r\nspring, and of the first killing frost in fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWIND AND PRESSURE OF THE GLOBE\r\n\r\n  CAUSE OF LOCAL WINDS AND OF GENERAL CIRCULATION\r\n\r\n\r\n=General Circulation.= Differences in temperature, changing the\r\nspecific gravity of the air, are the cause of the general circulation\r\nof the atmosphere about the earth, modified by the rotation of the\r\nearth; likewise the local circulation between land and water is\r\ncaused by the different quantities of heat radiated by the two widely\r\ndiffering forms of matter, each attaining to a different temperature\r\nunder the influence of the same solar radiation; and the inflow of\r\nwinds to the cyclone and the outflow from the anti-cyclone are due to\r\nthe same forces that cause the general and the local circulations.\r\n\r\nIf there were no difference in temperature between the equator and\r\nthe poles the atmosphere would soon adjust itself in accordance with\r\nthe laws of gravity, modified by the centrifugal force developed from\r\nthe rotation of the earth, and the atmosphere forever would be at\r\nrest relative to the earth, moving with it as if it were a part of\r\nthe solid sphere throughout its diurnal rotation on its axis and its\r\nannual movement about the sun. But there is a decided difference in\r\ntemperature between the equator and the poles and between land and\r\nwater surfaces; hence a general circulation, modified and distorted\r\nby numerous local movements, which, in turn, may be modified by the\r\nheight of hills and mountains and the direction of their trend.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—Trade wind circulation and reason for belts\r\nof high pressure at latitudes 30° N. and S. that extend around globe\r\nas shown by Figure 13.]\r\n\r\nLet us trace a current of air through its course as shown in\r\nFigure 12 and the reason for the blowing of the trade winds will\r\nbe apparent, as will the reason for the location of a belt of high\r\npressure at latitudes 30° north and south encircling the globe. At\r\nthe equator there is a belt of calms. Here the air gently ascends\r\nunder the intense heat of vertical sunshine. It is humid, for\r\nthere is much water surface in the region of the equator, and the\r\nair carries vast quantities of water vapor aloft, later to be\r\nprecipitated as torrential rains in the Tropical Zone, as the air\r\ncools by expansion in its ascent. This air expands or bulges upward\r\nand overflows aloft northward and southward, causing low air pressure\r\nat the equator, because of the quantity of air moved to other\r\nlatitudes, which more than compensates for the amount banked up over\r\nthe equator by the centrifugal force of the earth’s rotation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 1.—HIGH AND LOW CENTERS OF ACTION AND PREVAILING\r\nWINDS OF THE GLOBE FOR JULY (Buchan).]\r\n\r\nSince air, passing away from the equator, must pass successively\r\nover parallels of latitude having less easterly velocity than that\r\nwith which it started its journey, it runs ahead of the earth, and,\r\nrelative to the surface of the earth, has a direction from the\r\nsouthwest north of the equator, and from the northwest south of the\r\nequator. Our current was divided at an altitude probably of six miles\r\nabove the equator, one half following the northern and the other half\r\nthe southern circuit. It was cooled by elevation and by radiation\r\noutward to space and as a result gained in weight and gradually\r\ndescended, reaching the earth at about latitudes 30° north and south,\r\nand causing an accumulation of air at those latitudes and the belt\r\nof high pressure that irregularly surrounds the earth. In descending\r\nin the belt the air breaks up into a number of anti-cyclonic systems,\r\nsub-permanent highs or Centers of Action, which have so much to do\r\nwith initiating the migratory Highs and Lows that create the weather\r\nof the earth, as will be fully explained in the Chapter on Weather\r\nForecasting. The intensity of these centers of action is modified and\r\ntheir geographic positions shifted with change of season. (See Charts\r\n1 and 2.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 2.—HIGH AND LOW CENTERS OF ACTION AND PREVAILING\r\nWINDS OF THE GLOBE FOR JANUARY (Buchan).]\r\n\r\n=Trade Winds.= But to return to the current that we left as it\r\ndivided above the equator (Figure 12) and descended on an inclined\r\nplane to latitudes 30° north and south. It is cooler and dryer and\r\nheavier than when it started to ascend and it has lost the thousand\r\nmiles per hour and more easterly velocity that it had at the equator\r\nand now only has the velocity that belongs to latitude 30°; therefore\r\nas it moves toward the equator from either side it lags behind\r\nlatitudes whose easterly velocity is greater, and it takes up a\r\ndirection partly toward the west, which, relative to the earth, makes\r\nit a northeast wind in the Northern Hemisphere and a southeast wind\r\nin the Southern Hemisphere. And thus is established a circulation the\r\nlower part of which is known as the “trade winds.” (Figure 13.)\r\n\r\nNavigators profit largely by availing themselves of the west winds\r\nin the middle latitudes and of the east winds in the tropics. To\r\nthe daring and persistence of Columbus, and the force and constancy\r\nof the trade winds which blew him westward, we owe the discovery of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—Average surface winds and pressure of the\r\nglobe.]\r\n\r\n=Winds of Middle Latitudes.= Now study Figure 12 and associate the\r\ninformation it conveys with that of Figure 13, and observe that from\r\nthe two belts of high pressure the air is pushed outward on both\r\nsides. In each case it starts as a true north or south wind, but, due\r\nto the rotation of the earth, is always and everywhere deflected to\r\nthe right in the Northern Hemisphere and to the left in the Southern\r\nHemisphere, and this deflection increases until what started as a\r\npoleward wind in the middle latitudes soon becomes almost a due\r\nwest wind. In this region of west winds cyclonic storms are more\r\nfrequent than in any other part of the globe. Now get clear in the\r\nmind the fact that no matter what may be the direction of the wind\r\ninside a cyclonic or anti-cyclonic whirl (often one thousand miles in\r\ndiameter), the whirl is carried toward the east by the general drift\r\nfrom the west of the winds between latitudes 30° and 60°, and toward\r\nthe west in the region of the trade winds.\r\n\r\n=Low Barometer at the Poles.= Even though the air is contracted and\r\nrendered denser by the great cold of the Arctic regions, the pressure\r\nremains low because of the quantity of air driven equatorward by\r\nthe centrifugal force both of the earth and of the winds themselves\r\nas they rim ahead of the earth and encircle the globe in the middle\r\nlatitudes.\r\n\r\n=Data too Meager to Show Full Circulation Aloft of the Atmosphere\r\nof the Globe.= Many charts have been published in the attempt to\r\nshow how the atmosphere circulates below and aloft through the whole\r\nworld. They only have speculative value, as our knowledge is too\r\nlimited to permit us to unravel the complexities of all the upper\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n=Rain Winds of the Tropics.= The trade winds, mostly moving over\r\nwater surfaces, are laden with moisture, but, gaining temperature as\r\nthey move towards the equator, their capacity to hold water vapor\r\nsteadily increases, and therefore they do not become rain winds\r\nunless forced to ascend by the interposition of mountains, or until\r\ncooled by ascension at the equator. In no part of the world does the\r\nair rise so steadily and in such great volume as in the equatorial\r\nbelt of calms and low pressure. Hence this is the region of greatest\r\nrainfall. During the two rainy seasons, spring and fall, the day\r\nopens clear; near midday the clouds gather and rain falls early in\r\nthe afternoon; after which it quickly clears. This is so regular\r\na program that one lays his plans accordingly. There is almost no\r\nrain in December and January; this is because the belt of calms and\r\nthe inflowing trade winds move northward and southward with the\r\nmigrations of the sun, and in December and January, the sun being\r\nfar south, the northern trades, with their rainless winds, cover\r\nthe equator and the region formerly occupied by the belt of calms.\r\nIn midsummer the sun is far north and then the southern trades move\r\nup and give dryness to the equator. In the northern trades, of the\r\nmoderate amount of rain that falls, the greater quantity falls in\r\nsummer; in the southern trades the order is reversed.\r\n\r\n=Rain of the High-Pressure Belts and of the Regions of West Winds.=\r\nIn the high-pressure belts the air is settling down and gaining heat\r\nby compression and there is not much horizontal movement. These are,\r\ntherefore, regions of but little rainfall, and all the great deserts\r\noccur in or near them. The belts of west winds are the regions of\r\nmost frequent cyclonic activities. Here the rainfall is quite equally\r\ndistributed throughout the year and is the result of the mixing of\r\nthe air by storms and its cooling by expansion as it is carried\r\nupward in the migrating whirl.\r\n\r\n=Circulation between Continents and Oceans.= In Chapter X, under the\r\nsub-caption “Influence of Continents and Oceans on Climate”, the\r\ncirculation between them is well explained. In general the movement\r\nis from the continent to the oceans in winter, with the air flowing\r\ninward aloft to settle down and take the place of that which passes\r\nout to sea. In summer the directions are reversed.\r\n\r\n=Daily Variation in Coastal Winds.= In summer, when there are no\r\nforceful storm winds blowing steadily from one direction for several\r\nhours at a time, there will daily spring up gentle to fresh winds\r\nfrom the surface of oceans and large lakes to the land, because of\r\nthe influence of the sun’s rays in heating the land to a higher\r\ntemperature than it does the water. These winds will not appear on\r\ncloudy days and they will extend inland but a few miles.\r\n\r\n=Monsoon Winds.= During winter the vast continent of Eurasia (Europe\r\nand Asia) cools to such an extremely low temperature as to develop a\r\nHigh, or center of action, of great energy and extent, which drives\r\na steady dry monsoon into the Indian Ocean and China Sea. Unlike the\r\ntrade winds, these winds reverse their direction in the summer; then\r\nthe intense heat of the continent to the north develops an extensive\r\nLow, which draws the ocean winds inland and extends its influence so\r\nfar south as to attract the southeast trade winds of the Southern\r\nHemisphere and, turning them so that they flow from the southwest,\r\ncontinue them far into the interior of Asia. Since the summer monsoon\r\nblows from a tropical sea it comes heavily laden with water vapor\r\nand as it rises over the mountains of the great Himalayan system\r\ncopious rains are precipitated. In Australia, Africa, South America,\r\nand some parts of the North American continent monsoon influence in\r\nvarious degrees is felt, but in no place is the monsoon so important\r\nas in the countries bordering the Indian Ocean. (Charts 15 and 16.)\r\n\r\n=Föhn Winds.= This is a hot wind that sometimes blows down a mountain\r\nside in the Alps. In the Rocky Mountains it is called the Chinook\r\nWind. It is caused by moisture-laden air being drawn over a high\r\nmountain so quickly that the heat liberated in condensation does not\r\nhave time to escape by radiation. The air cools by expansion as it\r\nascends on the west side of the mountain, but it gains this all back\r\nby compression as it descends, and it has added to its temperature\r\nmuch of the heat of condensation. It is dry and greedily evaporates\r\nsnow from the ground in winter, clearing off a deep covering within a\r\nfew hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—How winds would blow into a cyclone on a\r\nnon-rotating earth.]\r\n\r\n=How Winds Are Deflected by Earth’s Rotation.= Every free-moving\r\nthing, whether wind or projectile, is deflected to the right of\r\nits initial direction by the rotation of the earth in the Northern\r\nHemisphere and to the left in the Southern Hemisphere, unless the\r\nobject be moving exactly along the line of the equator. Winds moving\r\ninward to a Low are therefore so deflected as to cause the cyclone\r\nto gyrate in a direction contrary to the movements of the hands of\r\na watch. In an anti-cyclone the movement is with the watch. In the\r\nSouthern Hemisphere these wind directions are reversed.\r\n\r\nFigure 14 gives an illustration of what would be the movement of\r\nair inward to a cyclone on a non-rotating earth. The winds would\r\nblow along radial lines for a time, but, converging together as they\r\nbegan to ascend, they doubtless would soon set up a gyration about\r\nthe center. On a non-rotating earth this gyration would be clockwise\r\nas often as it would be anti-clockwise, but on a rotating earth the\r\ngyration can be in but one direction. (Figure 15.) Even tornadoes,\r\nwhose diameters of rotation are never but a few hundred feet, obey\r\nthis law. In little dust whirls, in which the movements of air may\r\nbe comprehended from the motion of the trash that is whirled about\r\nand which are tornadoes in miniature, the direction of gyration may\r\nbe either way. They are too small for the deflecting force to be\r\nappreciable, and it may be that the tornado is forced to take its\r\ndirection of gyration from the cyclone in whose southeast quarter it\r\nhas its origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—Deflection of wind due to earth’s rotation.]\r\n\r\n=How Wind Velocity Increases with Altitude.= Figure 16 shows how\r\nthe velocity of the wind increases with elevation in the free air\r\nup to five thousand meters (about three miles). The average for the\r\nyear, for the summer and for the winter, is given. It increases most\r\nrapidly up to six hundred meters in summer and up to eight hundred\r\nmeters in winter. From these two heights there is a steady and\r\npronounced slowing down of the wind up to one thousand meters; after\r\nwhich it increases up to five thousand meters, and how far beyond we\r\nknow not. In winter there is a singular acceleration of velocity in\r\nthe stratum between two thousand and twenty-five hundred meters and\r\nthen no increase for the next five hundred meters; after which there\r\nis a uniform and steady gain up to five thousand meters. Starting at\r\ntwo hundred and seventy meters, the average velocity for the year is\r\n3½ meters per second, or about 7¼ miles per hour. At five thousand\r\nmeters altitude the average for the year is 11¼ meters per second, or\r\nabout 27 miles per hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Annual, summer, and winter wind velocities,\r\nwith altitude. 1, 1850 feet; 2, 2467 feet; 3, 3083 feet; 4, 15,417\r\nfeet.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nHOW TO FORECAST FROM THE DAILY WEATHER MAP\r\n\r\n  IT IS NOT DIFFICULT TO BECOME WEATHERWISE AND THEREBY TO GAIN\r\n  ADVANTAGES IN HEALTH, HAPPINESS, AND BUSINESS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe person who will take the time to learn to interpret the daily\r\nweather map has a decided advantage over those who are less\r\nprogressive. The maps may be secured by applying to any Weather\r\nBureau station. Many members of commercial associations, having the\r\nadvantage of seeing the large glass weather map that is made each\r\nmorning by an observer of the Weather Bureau and displayed on the\r\nfloor of the association, have become expert weather forecasters. The\r\nvalue of the principal crops of the country is largely influenced\r\nby the weather, as are the prices of transportation and industrial\r\nstock; and there is hardly a business that directly or indirectly is\r\nnot influenced by the prospects of coming weather.\r\n\r\nVessel masters, long accustomed to forecast the near approach of\r\nstorms from the action of their “glass” (barometer), now have learned\r\nthat the daily weather map shows them at a glance the height of not\r\none but of many barometers scattered over a wide area and read at the\r\nsame moment of time. They see that the direction and the force of the\r\nwind are the results of differences in air pressure; that the air\r\nflows from a region where the air pressure is great, that is to say,\r\nwhere the barometers are high, towards a region where the pressure is\r\nless, or where the barometers are low; and that the velocity of the\r\nwind will be in proportion to the difference in the pressure of the\r\nair. Coast-wise and lake shipping are therefore not only affected by\r\nthe forecasts made by the Weather Bureau but by the forecast made by\r\nthe masters themselves when they can get access to the daily weather\r\nmap. Their own lives and the lives and property of others are in\r\ntheir keeping. But the great mass of intelligent people have no idea\r\nof the methods employed in the making of the weather map and of the\r\nmany and widely diversified uses to which a study of its data would\r\nlead.\r\n\r\nOne first must learn of the simple manner in which the map is\r\nconstructed; then, by a comparison of the map each day with the\r\npreceding chart, he soon will be able to detect the beginning of\r\nstorms, trace them through their various migrations as they cross\r\nthe continent and finally pass out to sea, bidding them bon voyage\r\nas they go in quest of a more eastern continent on which to bestow\r\ntheir blessings of rain and active, purified air; or, as it often may\r\nhappen, shuddering for the fate of the mariner who is caught in their\r\nfierce vortical whirls, and for the land areas that may be laid waste\r\nby their gyrating force.\r\n\r\n=How the Weather Map Is Made.= At 8 A.M. to-day Washington time,\r\nwhich, by the way, is about seven o’clock at Chicago, six at Denver,\r\nand five at San Francisco, the observers at some two hundred stations\r\nin the United States and contiguous territory were taking their\r\nobservations and from carefully standardized instruments noting\r\nthe conditions of the atmosphere. By 8:20 A.M. the barometers at\r\neach station have been reduced to sea level, that is to say, they\r\nhave been made to read what they would if they were located at the\r\nlevel of the ocean. Thus differences in air pressure that are due to\r\ndifferences in elevation are eliminated, so that they may not obscure\r\nthose due to storm conditions. Then, for purposes of brevity and\r\naccuracy, the observations are reduced to cipher form, and each\r\nfiled at the local telegraph office. During the next thirty or forty\r\nminutes the observations, with the right of way over all lines, are\r\nspeeding to their destinations, each station contributing its own\r\nreport, and receiving in return such observations from other stations\r\nas it may require. The observations from all stations are received at\r\nsuch important centers as Washington, New York, Chicago, and other\r\nlarge cities having Weather Bureau stations, and from these centers\r\ndaily weather maps are printed and issued at 11 A.M. each day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 3.—WINTER STORM, DECEMBER 15, 1893, 8 A.M.\r\n\r\nBlack lines connect places having equal barometric pressure; arrows\r\npoint in direction wind is blowing; figures at end of arrows show\r\nwind velocity, when it is more than light.\r\n\r\n  ○ clear; ◓ partly cloudy; ● cloudy; R rain; S snow.\r\n\r\nHIGH indicates center of anti-cyclone, or high-pressure area; LOW\r\nindicates center of cyclone, or low-pressure area.\r\n\r\nLarge figures show average temperature in each quadrant of cyclone.]\r\n\r\nNow turn to Chart 3. Heavy black lines (isobars, meaning equal\r\npressure) are drawn through places having the same barometric\r\nreading. The readings are omitted from the printed Chart. By drawing\r\nlines for each difference of one tenth of an inch, the high and the\r\nlow-pressure areas (called Highs and Lows) are soon inclosed in their\r\nproper circles. These lines run in oval or circular form, indicating\r\nthat storms operate in the form of great atmospheric eddies; that\r\nthere are central places of attraction _towards_ which the air is\r\ndrawn if the disturbance be a low-pressure area, with its usual\r\naccompaniments of warm, moist, and often rainy weather, and _from_\r\nwhich the air is driven if it be a high-pressure area, with cool,\r\nsettled weather.\r\n\r\nThe word “High” is written inside the isobar marked 30.6, located\r\nin southern Oregon, and the same word is written inside the isobar\r\nmarked 30.4, located on the South Atlantic coast, and also inside the\r\nisobar 30.04, which traverses Nova Scotia. These are the regions of\r\ngreat air pressure. The word “Low” is written at the center of the\r\narea inclosed by the isobar 29.6, which is situated in the State of\r\nIowa. The latter is the region of least pressure. Sometimes there are\r\nseveral such regions shown on the weather map.\r\n\r\n=Why the Wind Blows.= Under the pull of gravity the atmosphere\r\npresses downward and outward, thus causing it to flow from the\r\nseveral regions of great pressure towards regions of less pressure.\r\nObserve the arrows, which fly with the wind, and it will be seen how\r\ngenerally this law is obeyed. The velocity with which the wind moves\r\nfrom the High toward the Low depends on differences in air pressure,\r\nmodified in the lower stratum by the friction offered in passing over\r\nsurfaces of varying degrees of roughness, the speed being greater\r\nover a water surface with the same difference in air pressure than\r\nover a level unwooded prairie, and greater over the open prairie than\r\nover an irregular wooded area. To illustrate:\r\n\r\nIf the barometer were 30.5 at Bismark, Dakota, and 29.5 at\r\nChicago, it would press upon the earth with a force of about seventy\r\npounds greater per square foot at the first place than at the second.\r\nThis difference in pressure would cause the air to flow from Bismark\r\ntowards Chicago so rapidly that after allowing for the resistance\r\ndue to friction on the earth there would remain a velocity of some\r\nfifty miles per hour, and Lake Michigan would experience a severe\r\n“Northwester”; and if the wind continued from the same direction for\r\ntwenty-four hours a mighty sea would beat upon the eastern shore of\r\nthe lake, and mariners and marine property would be at the mercy of a\r\ndestructive tempest unless the Weather Bureau forecaster were alert\r\nand gave warning as soon as he saw such a juxtaposition of pressure\r\ndistribution in the process of formation.\r\n\r\nWe will give careful attention to this chart, for when its details\r\nare understood, others will be easily read.\r\n\r\nThe chart shows a winter storm central in Iowa on December 15, 1893.\r\nThe word “Low” marks the storm center. It is the one place in all the\r\nUnited States where the barometer reading is the lowest. The heavy\r\nblack lines, oval and nearly concentric, about the Low, show the\r\ngradation of air pressure as it increases quite uniformly in all\r\ndirections from the center of the storm outward.\r\n\r\nThe arrows fly with the wind, and, as will be seen, almost without\r\nexception are moving towards the Low, or storm center, clearly\r\ndemonstrating the effect of gravity in causing the air to flow from\r\nthe several regions marked “High”, where the air is abnormally heavy,\r\ntoward the Low, where the air is lighter. As the velocity of water\r\nflowing down an inclined plane depends both upon the slope of the\r\nplane and the roughness of its surface, so the velocity of the wind,\r\nas it flows along the surface of the earth towards the storm center,\r\ndepends on the amount of the depression of the barometer at the\r\ncenter and the resistance offered by surfaces of varying degrees of\r\nroughness.\r\n\r\n=Storms and Cold Waves Simply Great Eddies in the Atmosphere.= Now\r\npicture in your mind that all the air inside the 30.2 isobar, as it\r\nflows inward, is rotating about the Low in a direction contrary to\r\nthe movements of the hands of a watch, and you have a fair conception\r\nof an immense atmospheric eddy. Have you ever watched the placid\r\nwaters of a deep-flowing brook and observed that where the waters\r\nencountered a projecting rock little eddies formed and went spinning\r\ndown the stream? Well, our storms are somewhat similar eddies in the\r\natmosphere, more or less perfect, that are carried along by the\r\ngeneral easterly movement of the atmosphere in the middle latitudes\r\nof both hemispheres. But they are not deep eddies; the Low marks the\r\ncenter of an atmospheric circulation of vast horizontal extent as\r\ncompared with its thickness or extension in a vertical direction.\r\nThus a storm area extends from Washington, D. C., to Denver,\r\nColorado, and yet extends upward only about six miles. The whole disk\r\nof whirling air, six miles thick and two thousand miles in diameter,\r\nis called a cyclone, or low-pressure area. It is important that a\r\nproper understanding be had of this fundamental idea, since the\r\nweather experienced from day to day depends almost wholly upon the\r\nmovement of these migrating cyclones, or areas of low pressure, and\r\nthe anti-cyclones, or areas of high pressure.\r\n\r\nThe temperature readings are omitted from each station, but the\r\naverage temperature of each quadrant of the Low is shown by the\r\nlarge black figures. The greatest difference in temperature is seen\r\nto be between the southeast and the northwest sections. This is due\r\nin part to the fact that in the southeast quadrant the air is drawn\r\nnorthward from warmer latitudes, and in the northwest quadrant it is\r\ndrawn southward from colder latitudes, and to the further fact that\r\nwinds blowing into the west side of a Low have a downward component\r\nof motion, and those blowing in on the front, or east side, have an\r\nupward component.\r\n\r\nOne should gain a clear idea of the difference between the movements\r\nof the air in the cyclone and the movement of the cyclone itself,\r\nor its translation from place to place; how the wind must blow into\r\nthe front of the storm in a direction partly or wholly contrary to\r\nthe movement of the storm itself, and into the rear of the storm as\r\nit passes away; how the wind increases in velocity as it spirally\r\ngyrates about the center and approaches nearer and nearer the region\r\nwhere it must ascend; how the higher layers of air move spirally away\r\nfrom the center and thus cause an accumulation of air about and over\r\nthe outer periphery of the Low, which in turn presses downward and\r\nimpels the surface air inward. This whole complex system of motion\r\nmoves eastward. Think of the sun drifting in space, while at the\r\nsame time each of the planets maintains its respective orbit, and it\r\nwill help one to visualize the phenomena of a migrating cyclone or\r\nanti-cyclone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 4.—WINTER STORM, DECEMBER 15, 1893, 8 P.M.\r\n\r\nBlack lines connect places having equal barometric pressure; red\r\nlines connect places having equal temperature; arrows point in\r\ndirection wind is blowing; figures at end of arrows show wind\r\nvelocity when it is more than light.\r\n\r\n  ○ clear; ◓ partly cloudy; ● cloudy; R rain; S snow.\r\n\r\nHIGH indicates center of anti-cyclone, or high-pressure area; LOW\r\nindicates center of cyclone, or low-pressure area.\r\n\r\nLarge figures show average temperature in each quadrant of cyclone.\r\n\r\nShading shows precipitation area of last 24 hours.]\r\n\r\nChart 4, constructed from observations taken twelve hours later,\r\nshows that the Low has moved from central Iowa since 8 A.M., and is\r\nnow, at 8 P.M., central over the southern point of Lake Michigan.\r\nThe shaded portion of the chart shows that rain has fallen during\r\nthe past twelve hours throughout nearly the entire region covered\r\nby the cyclone. This was due to the mixing of the air as the storm\r\nprogressed, to the cooling by expansion as the air ascended, to the\r\nmore rapid rotation about the storm center, because of the further\r\nlowering of the barometer at the center of the disturbance since\r\nthe preceding chart was made, and especially to the more humid air\r\nencountered as the storm moved eastward and came nearer to the supply\r\nof moist winds,—the Atlantic Ocean.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 5.—WINTER STORM, DECEMBER 16, 1893, 8 A.M.\r\n\r\nBlack lines connect places having equal barometric pressure; red\r\nlines connect places having equal temperature; arrows point in\r\ndirection wind is blowing; figures at end of arrows show wind\r\nvelocity, when it is more than light.\r\n\r\n  ○ clear; ◓ partly cloudy; ● cloudy; R rain; S snow.\r\n\r\nHIGH indicates center of anti-cyclone, or high-pressure area; LOW\r\nindicates center of cyclone, or low-pressure area.\r\n\r\nLarge figures show average temperature in each quadrant of cyclone.\r\n\r\nShading shows precipitation area of last 24 hours.]\r\n\r\nOn Chart 5 a line of arrows extends from the storm center westward\r\nto Wyoming, where the storm originated. A small cross inclosed by\r\na circle marks its western extremity. Another cross located near\r\nCheyenne shows where the storm center was located twelve hours\r\nafter its origin. A third cross gives it location near Des Moines\r\ntwenty-four hours after it started eastward. It was here that we\r\nbegan the study of this storm on Chart 3. A cross near Chicago\r\nindicates the distance traveled by the center during the third twelve\r\nhours, and Chart 5 shows its progress during the fourth twelve-hour\r\nperiod. When the storm was central at Cheyenne the danger warnings\r\nfor mariners were displayed at all ports of the Great Lakes, as\r\nthe forecaster knew that in accordance with general laws the storm\r\nmust move toward the east. When it was centered at Chicago, danger\r\nwarnings were displayed on the Atlantic coast from North Carolina to\r\nMaine, as it was known that long before the storm reached the ocean\r\nthe in-rush of wind toward the storm center would cause a dangerous\r\non-shore gale and the breaking of heavy seas on the shore line. All\r\ncraft that could be reached with the danger signals made safe in\r\nport, except the great ocean liners, which are of such strength as\r\nto safely withstand almost any storm. A special set of observations\r\nordered by the Washington office of the Weather Bureau from its\r\nstations in the region of the storm, and well in advance of it, kept\r\nthe chief forecaster informed as to the progress of the cyclone,\r\nand before the storm center reached the coast the danger signals\r\ncommunicated to mariners the fact that the winds would soon shift to\r\nnorthwest as the center of the disturbance passed out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe reader’s attention will now be directed to the red lines on Chart\r\n5; they pass through places having the same temperature, but for\r\nsimplicity the readings of temperature, whereby these lines were\r\nlocated, are omitted from the printed chart. Observe the line marked\r\n40°; it passes across southern New England to western New York,\r\nbut when it reaches the center of the storm it encounters the cold\r\nnorthwest winds blowing into the storm on its west side and is forced\r\nsouthward to Texas.\r\n\r\nCharts 3, 4, and 5 give a graphic history of one severe winter storm.\r\nIn summer such general storms do not often occur. They are frequent\r\nin spring and fall, but of higher temperature and less severity than\r\nin winter. In summer Lows drift sluggishly across the continent; the\r\nbarometer at the center of the cyclone is usually not more than two\r\nto four tenths of an inch below the pressure of the Highs, and the\r\nrain, instead of falling in a broad sheet, as shown by the shading of\r\ncharts 4 and 5, falls in numerous sporadic outbursts, each of which\r\nis but a few square miles in area, their combined surfaces usually\r\ncovering only a part of the region over which passes the Low.\r\n\r\n=Cold Waves and the Speed of Storm Movement.= Highs and Lows drift\r\nacross the continent from the west towards the east at the average\r\nrate of about six hundred miles per day, or about thirty-seven miles\r\nper hour in winter and twenty-two miles in summer, the first at\r\nabout the rate of an express train, and the second approximating\r\nthe speed of a freight. The Highs are attended by dry, cool, and\r\nsettled weather. By a vortical action at their centers they draw down\r\nthe cold air from great altitudes above the clouds. In winter, when\r\nvortical action is vigorous, they may reach upward to an altitude of\r\nseven miles. Air starting downward from this region has a temperature\r\nof some 70° below zero. We know this from the records secured\r\nby sending aloft free balloons carrying automatic thermometers.\r\n(Chapters II and III.) This air heats by compression because in its\r\ndownward movement it is continually leaving more and more air above\r\nit to exercise pressure upon it. It gains about twenty degrees with\r\neach mile of descent, and if there were no other factors to the\r\nproblem it would be hot air when it reached the surface of the earth\r\ninstead of cold air. But early in its descent it gains such heat\r\nas to melt and evaporate the ice spiculæ floating at the height of\r\nthe fleecy cirrus clouds; then it evaporates and clears away the\r\nmoist clouds lower down and finally creates such _diathermancy_ (the\r\ncapacity to transmit heat without absorption; see Chapter V) that the\r\nheat lost by radiation to a clear sky causes what we call a “cold\r\nwave”, and this notwithstanding the heat of compression.\r\n\r\nThe forecaster first observes a cold wave in the northern Rocky\r\nMountain region, in the form of an intense High. It will travel\r\nsoutheastward to the center of the continent, and often to the Gulf\r\nif it is preceded by an active Low that is located on a low latitude,\r\nas the latter will draw southward the frosty air of the High; after\r\nthat the course of the storm will be more nearly eastward. Now\r\nit is of rare occurrence that a cold wave gains entrance to any\r\nconsiderable area of our territory without warning, but in the early\r\ndays of the Weather Bureau they too often reach Iowa, or States\r\nfarther east, without any notice whatever. It was then discovered\r\nthat a certain type of weather map preceded such failures of the\r\nforecaster. One who is interested in gaining early knowledge of\r\nthe approach of a cold wave to the United States should watch not\r\nonly for the appearance of abnormally high barometer readings, from\r\nthe stations of the Canadian Northwest, or from Montana and North\r\nDakota, but especially for a crescent-shaped Low, with one horn of\r\nthe crescent touching Lake Superior and the other extending into the\r\nmiddle Rocky Mountain region, at about Colorado. This Low will appear\r\nto be an innocent affair; there may be a small secondary Low in each\r\nend of the crescent, and no High of any importance in the northwest,\r\nfor which one ordinarily would look in anticipating a cold wave.\r\nBut when this crescent-shaped Low appears on the morning weather\r\nmap, a High of marked intensity invariably will develop with great\r\nsuddenness over Montana and North Dakota and bring a cold wave to the\r\nMiddle Mississippi Valley before the next morning, if the time of\r\nyear be winter.\r\n\r\nDo not forget that the Low is as important as the High in causing a\r\ncold wave, for the High that brings the cold air must follow in the\r\ntrack of the Low and will be attracted by the latter in proportion\r\nto its lowness, as indicated by the isobar inclosing the center of\r\nthe Low. A cold wave will reach the Gulf only if the preceding Low\r\noriginate in Texas; it will be confined to the Ohio Valley as the\r\nlimit of its southern influence if the preceding Low originate in\r\nColorado; and it will only skirt the northern border of the United\r\nStates and the Lake region if the Low begin in Montana.\r\n\r\nMore and more is man applying science to commerce and industry.\r\nWhen the weather map, which was unknown but little more than half a\r\ncentury ago, indicates the formation of a heavy body of cold air in\r\nthe extreme northwest, the chief official forecaster at Washington\r\nis on the alert; he orders special observations every few hours\r\nfrom the Weather Bureau stations directly within and well in advance\r\nof the cold area, and as soon as he becomes satisfied that a cold\r\nwave is on its way, the previously arranged system of disseminating\r\nwarnings is brought into action, and by telegraph, telephone, flags,\r\nwhistles, bulletins, and other agencies, the people in every city,\r\ntown and hamlet, and many in the stock and farming regions, are\r\nnotified of the advancing cold twelve to twenty-four hours before it\r\nreaches them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 6.—COLD WAVE ZONES, MARCH TO NOVEMBER. AMOUNT OF\r\nFALL AND VERIFYING LIMIT.]\r\n\r\nCharts 6 and 7 show how the Weather Bureau defines a cold wave.\r\nThere must be a fall of sixteen degrees, eighteen degrees, or twenty\r\ndegrees within thirty-six hours and a certain degree of coldness\r\nmust be reached. The charts show that what is a cold wave in the Gulf\r\nregion is far from one in the northwest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 7.—COLD WAVE ZONES, DECEMBER, JANUARY, AND\r\nFEBRUARY. AMOUNT OF FALL AND VERIFYING LIMIT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 8.—LOWEST TEMPERATURES IN THE UNITED STATES,\r\n1871-1913.]\r\n\r\nChart 8 shows the lowest temperatures experienced in the United\r\nStates since the founding of the Weather Bureau, 1871 to 1913. Note\r\nthe influence of the Pacific Ocean in forcing the zero line from\r\nArizona northward to British Columbia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 9.—NUMBER OF COLD WAVES, 1904-1914, INCLUSIVE.]\r\n\r\nChart 9 shows the number of times that a cold wave occurred at each\r\nstation of the Weather Bureau for a period of ten years. The number\r\nis greater for northern New England than for the Red River of\r\nthe North Valley, because practically all the cold waves that cross\r\nMinnesota reach New England; and the latter also receives fierce\r\nboreal visitors that come to it from the Hudson Bay region lying\r\ndirectly northeast, which do not visit any portion of Minnesota or\r\nthe region farther west. During the period not a single technical\r\ncold wave occurred at the coast stations of California, Oregon,\r\nor Washington, while Red Bluff and Sacramento were the only two\r\nplaces in California west of the Sierras, and Roseburg, Oregon, the\r\nonly station west of the Cascade Range that had any, the numbers\r\nbeing one, two, and five respectively. In the Florida peninsula\r\nsouth of Jacksonville, Tampa had two, while none occurred at Miami.\r\nSometimes the temperature falls lower than that required for a cold\r\nwave, but not within the period of twenty-four hours required by\r\nthe regulations. A notable case in point is the severe cold wave in\r\nCalifornia in January, 1913, the lowest temperature ever observed\r\nbeing recorded at San Diego on the 7th, when the minimum fell to 25°.\r\n\r\n=Cold Waves Tempered by Great Lakes.= The severity of cold waves is\r\nmarkedly modified by the Great Lakes, especially in the fall and the\r\nfirst part of winter, before much of the water surface is covered\r\nwith ice and snow. Not only is the number of cold waves much less at\r\nstations of the Lakes than at near-by places in the interior, but\r\nthere is a marked variation in the number that occur at the Lake\r\nstations, depending upon which side of the lake and how close to the\r\nwater the station is located. The most striking differences are noted\r\nin the Lake Michigan region, the number on the west shore being five\r\nor six times as great as on the east side. Milwaukee shows a count of\r\nforty-seven as compared with nine at Grand Haven. This lake influence\r\naffects the entire Lower Michigan peninsula, but it is not so great\r\nin the interior and eastern sections as along the west shore, Grand\r\nHaven’s nine standing out against fourteen, fifteen, and twenty-three\r\nfor Grand Rapids, Detroit, and Port Huron. A similar condition is\r\nnoted in New York State; Buffalo, Rochester, and Oswego, near the\r\nlake shore, had twenty, twenty-seven, and twenty-nine cold waves\r\nrespectively, while the interior stations of Ithaca, Binghamton, and\r\nSyracuse had thirty-eight, forty-five, and fifty-two.\r\n\r\n=Cold Waves Tempered by the Heat of Cities.= Another reason for\r\nthe lack of uniformity in the recorded number of cold waves in the\r\nvarious sections of the country is the difference between city and\r\nsuburban temperatures. Stations located in small villages or in the\r\nopen land will show a greater number of recorded cold waves than\r\nthose located in large cities, where the heat stored up by pavements\r\nand brick buildings during sunshine each day, and where the heat from\r\nthousands of chimneys, and maybe millions of human beings, holds the\r\nminimum temperature of night much above that of the free air in the\r\nopen country. Charles City, where the instruments have open country\r\nexposure had sixty-five cold waves, which far exceeds the number\r\nrecorded at any other station in Iowa.\r\n\r\nNo matter how severe may be the cold wave that appears in the\r\nnorthwest, it will not extend over Wyoming, Colorado, Utah, and any\r\nregion south of them, unless the center of the High extends well over\r\nthe Rocky Mountain Divide. Otherwise it will come down the east slope\r\nof the mountains and the cold will not cross them.\r\n\r\nIn the Lows the conditions of the air and its movements are exactly\r\nthe reverse of what they are in the Highs; the air is warmer and\r\nmoister, it is drawn spirally inward from all directions instead of\r\nbeing forced outward as in the High, and it ascends as it approaches\r\nthe center of depression, sometimes causing rain or snow as it cools\r\nby expansion during its ascent. While the air cools with ascent in\r\nthe Low at the same rate that it warms with descent in the High, the\r\nearth experiences a general warming effect with the passage of the\r\nLows, because the air falls but little in temperature as it rises\r\nbefore it reaches its dew point, and then there is a liberation of\r\nthe latent heat of condensation (see Chapter V); and what is more\r\nimportant, there is formed a covering of clouds that checks or wholly\r\nstops radiation outward from the lower air. However there are times\r\nwhen the passage of Lows produces a cooling effect. This is when\r\nabnormally hot weather has prevailed for some days; then the air may\r\nbe mixed, washed, and cooled by thunder-showers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 10.—STORM TRACKS FOR AUGUST FOR TEN YEARS.]\r\n\r\nHighs and Lows alternately drift across the continent in periods of\r\nabout three days each. They are a part of the divine economy that\r\nprovides for the seedtime and the harvest, for, as previously stated,\r\nthe Lows draw the warm, vapor-bearing currents inland from the Gulf\r\nand the ocean and cause them to deposit their moisture far to the\r\nnorth and west. Four sevenths of all our storms come from the middle\r\nor the north plateau regions of the Rocky Mountains, or at least\r\nenter our field of observation from those regions, and pass from this\r\narid or sub-arid section of the continent easterly over the Lakes\r\nand New England, producing but little rainfall. The greater part of\r\nthe remaining three sevenths are first observed in the arid regions\r\nof our southwestern States; they always move northeastward and can be\r\ndepended on to give bountiful rainfall so soon as or a little before\r\nthey reach the Mississippi River. Some of them cross the Atlantic and\r\naffect the continent of Europe. Charts 10 and 11 show the courses\r\nof storms in this country, and where they originate, or are first\r\nbrought under the survey of our system of observation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 11.—STORM TRACKS FOR FEBRUARY FOR TEN YEARS.]\r\n\r\n=West Indian Hurricanes.= A few of the most severe storms that touch\r\nany portion of our continent originate in the West Indies and travel\r\nin a northwesterly direction until they touch our Gulf or South\r\nAtlantic coast, when, passing from the influence of the northeast\r\ntrade winds which carried them westward, they recurve and pass along\r\nour eastern coast, usually with their centers offshore and following\r\nthe Gulf Stream. These violent atmospheric convulsions are usually\r\ndetected in the process of formation through the effectiveness of\r\nthe storm-warning service established by the writer during the\r\nSpanish-American War, under the direction of the President, for\r\nthe purpose of giving warning to our fleet before the coming of a\r\nhurricane. The President realized the great part played by storms in\r\nmany of the naval battles of the past, and it may be surmised that he\r\nwas more afraid of a West Indian hurricane than he was of the Spanish\r\nNavy. But Cervera was beaten and the blockade was raised before the\r\nhurricanes of 1898 began.\r\n\r\n=Galveston Hurricane.= The new Weather Service, with a cordon of\r\nstations down the Windward Islands and along the north coast of South\r\nAmerica, surrounding our fleet, and inaugurated as a war measure, so\r\ndemonstrated its value in locating and giving warning of the coming\r\nof a hurricane soon after the end of the war that Congress continued\r\nit as a permanent instrument of peace; and when the destructive\r\nGalveston Hurricane occurred in 1900 it detected the storm at its\r\ninception and so fully advised shipping of the storm’s movements that\r\nnot a vessel was lost as the storm roared and gyrated across the Gulf\r\nof Mexico and crashed upon the Texas coast, destroying a large part\r\nof the city and drowning six thousand people.\r\n\r\nThe hurricane is simply a rapidly gyrating cyclone; it usually is\r\nonly one to three hundred miles in diameter. The storm that destroyed\r\nGalveston moved across the Caribbean Sea at the rate of only about\r\neight to ten miles an hour. It increased its rate as it moved\r\nnorthward, crossing the Gulf at about fifteen miles per hour. The\r\nspeed of translation was so slow and the velocity of gyration so\r\nrapid that immense swells were propagated outward from the center of\r\nthe storm; they reached the Texas coast some sixteen hours before the\r\nstorm itself reached Galveston. As it moved northward to Iowa its\r\nvelocity of translation increased and its rate of gyration decreased,\r\nso that it crossed the Lakes with both movements at about sixty miles\r\nper hour. At Galveston the anemometer blew to pieces after recording\r\none hundred and thirty miles per hour.\r\n\r\n=Danger to Atlantic Coast Summer Resorts.= The writer frequently\r\nhas been asked as to the possibilities of a populous Atlantic coast\r\nresort being submerged by the waters driven inshore by a hurricane,\r\nor being lifted up in the center of the storm as the result of\r\ndecreased air pressure inside the cyclonic whirl. The answer is that\r\nsuch a catastrophe is possible to any Atlantic coast city (more\r\nespecially those south of Norfolk) that is not protected by a heavy\r\nbreakwater of ten to twenty feet above sea level, and whose building\r\nfoundations and walls are not of brick or concrete for at least ten\r\nfeet above the water level. It would be necessary for a West Indian\r\nhurricane of unusual intensity—one similar to that which wrecked\r\nGalveston—to be considerably deflected westward out of its normal\r\ntrack in order to hit one of our coast cities north of Chesapeake Bay\r\nso that the center of the storm would pass over it, or near enough to\r\ncause destruction. In Galveston there was little damage to strongly\r\nconstructed buildings of brick or stone.\r\n\r\n=The Breaking of Droughts.= It is most important for the forecaster\r\nto know when and how droughts may be broken. He will observe that\r\nwhen the great cereal plains are famishing for moisture the Lows\r\nall originate on the middle or north Rocky Mountain plateau, in the\r\nregion of Colorado or Montana, and that the drought continues until\r\nthe Lows begin to form in the extreme southwest—in Arizona, New\r\nMexico, or Texas. As previously stated such Lows always bring rain as\r\nthey move northeastward.\r\n\r\n=Warm Waves.= There come in summer periods of almost stagnation in\r\nthe drift of the Highs and the Lows across the continent. At such\r\ntimes if a High be centered in the South Atlantic Ocean, with its\r\ncenter at Bermuda, and its western limits extending into the South\r\nAtlantic coast States, there will result what is popularly known as\r\na warm wave, for the air will slowly and steadily move from the\r\nsoutheast, where the pressure is greater, towards the northwest,\r\nwhere it is less; it will receive constant accretions of heat\r\nfrom the radiating surface of the earth, and finally attain to a\r\ntemperature that is extremely uncomfortable to all forms of life,\r\nthat lowers the physical stamina, and that largely increases the\r\ndeath rate. This superheated condition of the lower stratum of air\r\nin which we live continues until a Low develops in the southwest and\r\na High in the northwest, which relation, as we already know, soon\r\nbrings rainfall to the interior of the country.\r\n\r\n=V-shaped Lows= are reasonably sure to cause precipitation, and\r\nif the barometer at the center of the Low be five to seven tenths\r\nbelow the outer limits of the depression, heavy precipitation and\r\ndestructive local storms may be expected.\r\n\r\n=Thunderstorms.= The thunderstorm is caused by cold and heavy air\r\nfrom above breaking through into a lighter and superheated stratum\r\nnext the earth. Some of them have a horizontal rolling motion which\r\nthrows forward the cool air in the direction in which the storm is\r\nmoving. It seldom is more than five or ten miles in width and twenty\r\nto thirty miles in length. In general, thunderstorms move from the\r\nwest toward some eastern point, more often southwest to northeast.\r\n\r\nThe frequency of thunderstorms is the greatest with ill-defined Lows\r\nwhose pressure is but little below the normal air pressure of thirty\r\ninches. Any depression of the barometer slightly below the level at\r\nsurrounding stations—such as occurs when a weak High of only thirty\r\ninches, or thirty and one tenth inches, breaks up into two or more\r\nareas, with slightly lower pressure between them—is fruitful of\r\nthunderstorms. A High of but modest intensity advancing eastward\r\ninto a region of slightly lower pressure and much higher temperature\r\ncauses thunderstorms along its eastern front. A temperature of 80°\r\non the morning weather map, with a high humidity, seldom can endure\r\nbeyond the second day without a break and the coming of cooling\r\nthunder-showers. Any Low with abnormal heat and humidity in its\r\nsoutheast quadrant is usually attended with numerous thunder squalls\r\nin the regions of high temperature and moisture.\r\n\r\nOf the thunderstorm days in the United States few occur in the\r\nRocky Mountain regions or in northern New England. The greatest\r\nnumber is in Florida and the Gulf States and thence northward up the\r\nMississippi Valley.\r\n\r\n=The Moon Has No Influence on the Weather.= The moon used to be the\r\nfarmer’s most valued friend as a forecaster of the weather and as a\r\nguide in the planting of crops, but a higher order of intelligence is\r\ncausing this fallacy to pass away. The moon’s nearness to the earth\r\nand the fact that its phases occur in about seven days, which is\r\nabout twice the period of storm recurrence, in the minds of many have\r\nendowed it with potency in the influencing of our weather. Rain may\r\noccur on the same day of the week for several weeks in succession,\r\nbut only occasionally, while the moon is constantly progressing from\r\none phase to another. The few cases that prove the mistaken theory\r\nare taken as proof conclusive, while the many cases that do not prove\r\nacceptable to the moon forecaster are ignored and not mentioned to\r\nhis friends nor even acknowledged to himself. One is reluctant to\r\nhave a belief disproved, no matter how ridiculous it may be. In fact,\r\nthe more untenable it is, the more tenaciously some adhere to it,\r\nas though they were loyally standing by an old friend who had made\r\nmistakes, but who still was good at heart. The attraction of the\r\nmoon, because of its nearness and notwithstanding its small mass, is\r\nfar more potent in the raising of the tides of the ocean than is the\r\nsun, but its attraction on our atmosphere produces a tide of only\r\nfour thousandths of an inch of the barometer, an influence that is\r\nshadowy and without the least influence in causing storms, or changes\r\nof any kind in the weather; and there is no possible way in which the\r\nmoon could influence the germination of seed or the growing of crops.\r\n\r\n=Equinoctial Storm.= As the summer wanes the Lows become more\r\npronounced and the sporadic showers give place to general rain storms\r\nalong in September. There is no objection to these storms being\r\nknown as “Equinoctial”, except that any date in the latter half of\r\nSeptember is as liable to show a beginning of these storms as is the\r\n21st or the 22d. The equinox simply marks the middle period in the\r\ntransition from one type of weather to another.\r\n\r\n=Forecasting from Halos.= The halos that sometimes surround the sun\r\nor the moon indicate the coming of precipitation to the extent of\r\nmaking manifest the presence in the upper air of large quantities of\r\nvapor of water in a congealed state. When the vapor of water cools\r\nquietly in the laboratory it frequently forms minute spheres of\r\nwater, which, strange to relate, may remain liquid all the way down\r\nto zero and below; but if touched or jostled they instantly turn to\r\nice, in the form of spiculæ, or needles; they are simply hexagonal\r\nslender prisms capped by hexagonal pyramids. These needles rotate\r\nor spin about as they fall. The geometrical relations of the facets\r\nof the crystals to the axis of rotation and to the line along which\r\nthey fall are a complex problem in optics. Suffice to say that the\r\nobserver, looking through a filmy cloud of such crystals, would see\r\nin one part of the sky a halo, in another part an arc of light, and\r\nin other directions bright spots like the sun, all of them arranged\r\nsymmetrically with regard to the sun and the observer’s zenith. A\r\nlunar halo is a large ring concentric about the moon. A secondary\r\nhalo surrounds the first. Mock suns or mock moons may appear\r\ncoincident with solar or lunar halos. The ice prisms through which\r\none sees the phenomena both refract and diffract the light as it\r\npasses through the cloud and by partly decomposing the rays render\r\nvisible a part of their elementary colors. The red is on the inside,\r\nnext to which is a little yellow or green, with bluish white on\r\nthe outside. In coronas, which are much smaller, the red is on the\r\noutside. A detailed description of these phenomena may be found in\r\nMoore’s “Descriptive Meteorology” (Appleton).\r\n\r\n=Tornadoes.= The cyclone has a diameter of a thousand to two\r\nthousand miles, the hurricane about one to three hundred and the\r\ntornado only one to ten hundred _feet_. The hurricane is much more\r\ndestructive than the cyclone, and the tornado is incomparably greater\r\nin velocity of gyration and rending force than the hurricane. New\r\nEngland, Florida, and the wide region including the eastern slope\r\nof the Rocky Mountains westward to the Pacific are nearly free from\r\nthe atmospheric convulsions that cause the tornadoes, and they are\r\ninfrequent in any Atlantic coast State, but numerous in the States\r\nbordering on the Mississippi River, and in the eastern halves of\r\nOklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska. During a year of great frequency of\r\ntornadoes, about ninety storms occurred, while during some other\r\nyears the number has been as low as twenty. The direction generally\r\nis toward the northeast. The average rate of movement of the tornado\r\ncloud is about twenty-five miles per hour and the width of its\r\ndestructive path only five hundred to one thousand feet; the time of\r\npassage is less than half a minute. It does not come upon one unseen\r\nand unheralded. Many times the advancing funnel-shaped clouds may be\r\nseen, and they always are accompanied by a great roar which may be\r\nheard for miles. Except a tornado cellar, the cellar of a frame house\r\nis the safest place. The writer has examined either the wrecks or the\r\nrecords of hundreds of tornadoes and does not know of a single case\r\nof a person being killed by a tornado in the cellar of a frame house.\r\nIf one is in the open and a tornado approaches, never flee to the\r\nnorth or to the east, but rather to the northwest, and one needs to\r\ntravel but a short distance to pass out of the track of the monster.\r\nThe tornado always twists counter clockwise, the same as the cyclone\r\nin whose southeast quadrant it nearly always occurs. On the southeast\r\nside of the path there are indrafts; so that it is safer, unless the\r\ntrack of the oncoming storm is clearly seen to be well to the north\r\nof the observer, for one to run toward the northwest. Persons have\r\nstood near to the north side of a tornado track during its passage\r\nwithout suffering injury. If a cave, the cellar of a frame house, or\r\na narrow ditch cannot be reached, the best thing to do is to lie flat\r\non the ground as far from buildings and trees as possible.\r\n\r\nThe tornado is essentially an American storm, doubtless caused by the\r\nrunning together, in the southeast quadrant of a cyclone, of cold\r\nnorthwest currents and warm winds from the southeast, at a time when\r\nthe latter are saturated with moisture. They are confined almost\r\nentirely to the region between the two great mountain systems of the\r\ncontinent, none occurring in the Rocky Mountains and but few east of\r\nthe Alleghanies. The north and south trend of our mountain systems,\r\nquite different from the systems of Europe and Asia, facilitates\r\nthe coming together of conflicting winds of widely different\r\ntemperatures in the lower reaches of the atmosphere where there is\r\nan abundance of water vapor; no tornadic whirls probably can occur\r\nwithout an abundance of water vapor and the energizing effect of\r\nthe heat liberated in the whirling cloud as this vapor is suddenly\r\ncarried aloft and liberated by condensation right in the center of\r\nthe disturbance. Because of the relation of the trend of its great\r\nmountain systems to its oceans, the United States occupies a somewhat\r\nunique position meteorologically in the world. Its atmospheric\r\nconditions are more active than those of any other continent, which\r\nconditions are beneficial to the people of this country.\r\n\r\n=When to Watch the Weather Map for Tornadoes.= The four conditions\r\nessential to the formation of tornadoes are as follows:\r\n\r\n  1. A cyclone, the center of which is to the north or northwest;\r\n\r\n  2. An isotherm of 70° or over extending from the southeast well\r\n  up into the center of the cyclone, and then passing outward\r\n  toward the southwest, all inside the southeast quadrant of the\r\n  Low;\r\n\r\n  3. Excessive humidity;\r\n\r\n  4. Time of year March 15 to June 15.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—TORNADO CLOUD.]\r\n\r\nIf any one of the four foregoing conditions be absent, tornadoes are\r\nnot liable to occur. The reason why spring and early summer is the\r\ntime when tornadoes are most frequent is because the earth and a\r\nthin stratum of air immediately next the earth are heated up rapidly\r\nwith the gaining heat of the sun’s rays in the spring, while the air\r\na short distance aloft still retains much of the cold of winter. At\r\nthis time cyclonic action may bring together air masses of widely\r\ndifferent temperatures, especially when the upper layers on the west\r\nside of the Low are drawn down and commingled with the hot and humid\r\nsurface winds of the southeast quadrant.\r\n\r\n=Tornadoes Not Increasing.= The writer does not indorse the theory\r\nthat the number of these storms is increasing; that the breaking of\r\nthe virgin soil of the prairie, the planting or the cutting away of\r\nthe forests, the drainage of land surfaces by tiles, the stringing\r\nof thousands of miles of wire, or the laying of iron and steel rails\r\nhave materially altered the climate or contributed to the frequency\r\nor the intensity of storms. To be sure, as population becomes more\r\ndense greater destruction will ensue with the same number of storms.\r\n\r\n=Difficult to Forecast Tornadoes.= It is not possible for the\r\nforecaster to warn the exact cities and towns that will be struck by\r\ntornadoes without unduly alarming many places that will wholly escape\r\ninjury. What we know is that tornadoes are almost wholly confined\r\nto the southeast quadrant of a cyclone, and that when the thermal,\r\nhygrometric, and time conditions are favorable, a region about one\r\nor two hundred miles square will be sacrificed by a number of these\r\natmospheric twisters. One of the most destructive tornadoes of record\r\ndevastated St. Louis in the afternoon of May 27, 1896. The abnormal\r\nheat and humidity of a rather small and weak cyclone centered in\r\neastern Kansas on the morning weather map of that day, caused the\r\nWeather Bureau to distribute tornado forecasts at 10 A.M. throughout\r\nall of Missouri. The schools of St. Louis were dismissed and the\r\nchildren sent home on receipt of the warning, and although some eight\r\nor ten separate tornadoes touched various parts of the State and the\r\npeople were prepared for their coming, so many people were terrorized\r\nby the warning in communities that were not harmed, that the writer,\r\nthen Chief of the Weather Bureau, at once issued orders forbidding\r\nthe specific forecasting of tornadoes in the future. Under tornadic\r\nconditions the forecast is for “conditions favorable for severe local\r\nstorms.”\r\n\r\n=Freaks of the Tornado.= The writer was in St. Louis the day after\r\nthe storm and spent much time in examining the wreckage. He was\r\nimpressed with the fact that some buildings were burst outward and\r\nthat all four walls fell away from their bases, indicating that the\r\ntornado cloud must have lifted and dropped down over them in such a\r\nway that the partial vacuum that is created by the rotating cloud\r\nthrough centrifugal force so reduced the pressure of the air on the\r\noutside of the houses that the normal pressure of fifteen pounds per\r\nsquare inch exploded them. He saw bricks in a plastered wall that\r\nwere neatly cleaned of all plaster by the expansion of the air inside\r\nthe brick, as the air pressure from the outside was reduced. He saw a\r\ntwo by four pine scantling shot through five eighths of solid iron on\r\nthe Eads Bridge, the pine stick protruding several feet through the\r\niron side of the roadway, exemplifying the old principle of shooting\r\na candle through a board. He saw a six by eight piece of timber\r\ndriven four feet almost straight down into the hard compact soil, a\r\ngardener’s spade shot six inches into the tough body of a tree, a\r\nchip driven through the limb of a tree, and wheat straws forced into\r\nthe body of a tree to the depth of over half an inch. Such was the\r\nfearful velocity of the wind as it gyrated about the small center\r\nof the tornado,—a velocity exceeding that of any rifle bullet. (See\r\nFigures 17, 18, 19, and 20.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—THE ST. LOUIS TORNADO OF MAY 27, 1896, SHOT A\r\nPINE SCANTLING THROUGH THE IRON SIDE OF THE EADS BRIDGE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—THE ST. LOUIS TORNADO OF MAY 27, 1896, SHOT A\r\nSHOVEL SIX INCHES INTO THE BODY OF A TREE.]\r\n\r\nSome have advocated the planting of trees to the southwest of cities\r\nin the regions where tornadoes are frequent, so that the tornadoes\r\nmay expend their energy in uprooting the trees before they come to\r\nthe city, but this storm traveled through several miles of brick\r\nbuildings, razing them to the ground and almost pulverizing them\r\nand still left the city apparently with greater force than it had\r\non entering. The largest trees would offer no more resistance to a\r\ntornado cloud than would so many blades of grass.\r\n\r\nWhen the official forecasts contain the statement that conditions are\r\nfavorable for “severe local storms” it would be well to carefully\r\nobserve the formation of portentous clouds in the west and southwest,\r\nbetween 3 and 6 o’clock in the afternoon, and if one with black,\r\nragged fringes on its lower edge and accompanied with a noise like\r\nseveral railroad trains makes its appearance, seek safety in the\r\ncellar of a frame house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—THE ST. LOUIS TORNADO DROVE STRAWS ONE HALF\r\nINCH INTO WOOD.]\r\n\r\n=General Rules for Forecastings.= What has gone before in this\r\nchapter gives an idea of what guides the weather forecaster in\r\nmaking his deductions. In brief, he studies the developments and the\r\nmovements of the Highs and the Lows during the past two or three\r\ndays, as shown by preceding weather maps, and from the knowledge\r\ngained forecasts the future course and intensity of the fair and\r\nthe foul weather areas for one, two, or three days in advance. By\r\npreserving the weather map each day and noting the movements of the\r\nHighs and the Lows, any intelligent person can make a fairly accurate\r\nforecast for himself, always remembering that the Lows, as they drift\r\ntowards him, will bring warmer weather and sometimes rain or snow,\r\nand that as they pass his place of observation the Highs following\r\nin the tracks of the Lows will bring cooler and fair weather, except\r\nduring periods of extreme summer heat, when the Lows bring showers\r\nthat cool the parched earth; and except in the north Rocky Mountain\r\nplateau, where most of the precipitation occurs after the center of\r\nthe Low has passed and northwest winds are blowing.\r\n\r\nThe amateur weather forecaster can closely anticipate the temperature\r\nof his region by remembering that the weather will be cool and the\r\nhumidity low so long as the center of the predominating High (the\r\nHigh inclosing the greatest area within the thirty-inch isobar) is\r\nnorth of his latitude, either northeast or northwest, and that it\r\nwill be warm so long as the High is south of the parallel of latitude\r\nthat passes through his section of country.\r\n\r\nHe will find that the centers of the Lows will follow closely the\r\ndirection indicated by the isotherms that lead eastward out of their\r\ncenters, and that they move across the country from the west in quite\r\nregular succession, and that the frequent changes from sunshine to\r\nclouds and from warm to cold are the result of the mixing of the air\r\nby these atmospheric eddies.\r\n\r\nExperience will teach him that Lows from the southwest are reasonably\r\nsure of causing precipitation, and that if his temperature be\r\nsufficiently low—anywhere from zero to 20°—the fall will be in the\r\nshape of snow; that Lows that only skirt our northern border will be\r\ndeficient in precipitation, even if they cause any at all; that the\r\nslow settling of a High over the South Atlantic States means heat for\r\nall the rest of the country east of the Rocky Mountains in degree\r\nthat will be dependent upon the magnitude and the intensity of the\r\nsouthern High; that the heat will continue, even if temporarily\r\ninterrupted by showers, so long as this High retains its location in\r\nthe southeast; that tornadoes occur in the spring of the year when\r\nLows have excessive heat and humidity in their southeast quadrants;\r\nthat V-shaped Lows cause violent local storms, if not tornadoes, and\r\noften deluges of rain; and that frosts may be expected in the country\r\nwhen a minimum temperature of 40° is forecast for the city; and that\r\nthe severity of cold waves modifies as they come eastward, and that\r\nthey will only flow as far south as the area covered by the Low that\r\npreceded them,—that is to say, by that part of the Low included in\r\nthe thirty-inch isobar, or by a close approximation to such area.\r\n\r\nNational Forecaster E. H. Bowie, known to the writer as one of\r\nthe ablest forecasters ever developed by the Weather Bureau, in a\r\nrecent most valuable publication by the Bureau, entitled “Weather\r\nForecasting in the United States”, formulates rules for forecasting\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n1. When there is an area of high pressure over the southeast and\r\na cold wave in the northwest threatens, there will be a storm\r\ndevelopment in the southwest and precipitation will be general.\r\n\r\n2. If a storm form in the southwest and be forced to the left of a\r\nnormal track (Charts 10 and 11), another storm will immediately begin\r\nto develop in the southwest and it becomes a sure rain producer.\r\nStorms that develop in the southwest and move normally are quickly\r\nfollowed by clearing weather.\r\n\r\n3. Troughs of low pressure moving from the west are of two types—the\r\nnarrow and the wide. The former moves eastward slowly and storm\r\ncenters develop in the extreme northern and the extreme southern\r\nends. When the trough is wide, the development of an extensive storm\r\narea is not uncommon, especially if the wide intervening area between\r\nthe Highs shows relatively high temperatures.\r\n\r\n4. When the northern end of a trough moves eastward faster than the\r\nsouthern end, the weather conditions in the south and southwest\r\nremain unsettled and the chances are that a storm will form southwest\r\nof the High that follows. When the southern end moves faster than the\r\nnorthern end, settled weather follows.\r\n\r\n5. Storms that start in the northwest and move southeastward do not\r\ngather great intensity until they begin to recurve to the northward.\r\nAt the time of recurving they move slowly, as a rule, and care must\r\nbe exercised in predicting clearing weather.\r\n\r\n6. Marked changes in temperature in the southeast and northwest\r\nquadrants imply an increase in the storm’s intensity. Small\r\ntemperature changes do not indicate a further development of the\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n7. Abnormally high temperatures northwest of a storm indicate that it\r\nwill either retrograde or remain stationary.\r\n\r\n8. East of the Rocky Mountains, a storm which moves to the left of\r\nits normal track increases in intensity.\r\n\r\n9. Storms with isobars closely crowded on the west and northwest\r\ngenerally move slowly and to the east or southeast, and the\r\nprecipitation and high winds are maintained unusually long in the\r\nnorthern and western quadrants.\r\n\r\n10. Storms with the isobars closely crowded in the south and\r\nsoutheast quadrants move rapidly northeastward and the weather\r\nquickly clears after the passage of the storm center.\r\n\r\n=Rules for Making Local Forecasts.= As an illustration of what may\r\nbe done by the local observer or the layman in formulating rules\r\nof weather forecasting for his immediate vicinities, the following\r\nrules, which were evolved by the writer in 1892, while serving as\r\nthe Weather Bureau local forecaster for Milwaukee, Wisconsin, are\r\nsubjoined:\r\n\r\n1. In summer warmer weather occurs after the center of the Low has\r\npassed a little to the east, and southwest winds are blowing, because\r\nthe easterly winds, which otherwise would be the warmest winds, are\r\ncooled by passing over the lake.\r\n\r\n2. A Low from the northwest that reaches western Minnesota and\r\nwestern Iowa without precipitation or clouds will pass over Wisconsin\r\nas a dry Low, unless the isobars are closer than five eighths of an\r\ninch.\r\n\r\n3. Light frosts will occur on clear, quiet nights in the cranberry\r\nmarshes when minimum temperatures at Duluth and La Crosse fall to 40°\r\nand 45° respectively. When these stations record five degrees lower\r\nthe frost will be killing in the cranberry marshes and light in the\r\ntobacco fields of the southern counties of the State.\r\n\r\n4. No frost will occur in the counties bordering on Lake Michigan\r\nuntil the temperatures at the Weather Bureau stations fall close to\r\nthe freezing point, such is the influence of the lake in storing up\r\nheat and slowly radiating it during the night; and on the eastern\r\nside of the lake its protecting influence is much greater.\r\n\r\n5. When the wind sets in from points between south and southeast and\r\nthe barometer falls steadily, a storm is approaching from the west\r\nor northwest, and its center will pass near or north of the observer\r\nwithin twelve to twenty-four hours, with wind shifting to northwest\r\nby way of south and southwest. When the wind sets in from points\r\nbetween east and northeast and the barometer falls steadily, a storm\r\nis approaching from the south or southwest, and its center will pass\r\nnear or to the south of the observer within twelve to twenty-four\r\nhours, with wind shifting to northwest by way of north. The rapidity\r\nof the storm’s approach and its intensity will be indicated by the\r\nrate and the amount of the fall in the barometer.\r\n\r\n=Vast Extent of the Area Brought Under Observation.= It is a\r\nwonderful panoramic picture of atmospheric conditions which, by the\r\naid of the electro-magnetic telegraph and two hundred simultaneously\r\nreporting stations, is presented to the eye of the forecaster. Each\r\nday the kaleidoscope changes and a new graphic picture comes into\r\nview. Nowhere else in the world can the student of the weather find\r\nsuch opportunities.\r\n\r\nEarly meteorologists studied only the storm of low levels and humid\r\nairs, where convection only needed to carry the moist air currents to\r\nbut a slightly higher elevation before cooling by expansion would\r\nproduce condensation and an immediate acceleration of the cyclone by\r\nthe liberation of latent heat within the region of the upward-moving\r\nair in its central area. They never had seen the cyclones of the arid\r\nnorthern Rocky Mountain plateau move down to our Great Lakes with\r\nrapidly increasing energy, notwithstanding the fact that there had\r\nbeen little condensation, and hence no addition of the latent heat\r\nthat Espy supposed was essential to a continuation of storms.\r\n\r\nThe widely differing elevation, topography, temperature, and moisture\r\nof the broad region under observation by the United States Weather\r\nBureau present conditions unequaled for the study of every phase\r\nof storm development and translation, or at least such as may be\r\ncomprehended from data taken on the bottom of the atmospheric ocean;\r\nand it is but a matter of a short time when the data for extremely\r\nhigh levels will be added.\r\n\r\nHere we see summer cyclones formed under the intense solar radiation\r\nthat beats down through a nearly diathermanous atmosphere upon the\r\nwastes of the Rocky Mountain plateaus; cyclones that, if they form\r\nin the northern part of the plateau region, move eastward to our\r\nLakes and thence eastward to the St. Lawrence with scant rainfall;\r\ncyclones that, if they have their origin farther south in the region\r\nof Colorado, move into the Ohio Valley and thence to New England with\r\nconsiderably more precipitation; and cyclones that, if they have\r\ntheir origin anywhere in our southwest States or Texas, or enter\r\nour region of observation from the South Pacific Ocean, can always\r\nbe expected to cause general rainfall when they reach the Lower\r\nMississippi Valley and later as they pass up through the central\r\nportions of the continent.\r\n\r\nHere also one may view the great winter cyclones that originate in\r\nthe Pacific between Hawaii and the Aleutian Islands and come under\r\nour vision as they successfully surmount the formidable barriers\r\nof the Rocky Mountains with but little diminution of energy, sweep\r\nacross our continent with increasing force and heavy precipitation,\r\nand within three days pass beyond our meteorological horizon at the\r\nAtlantic seaboard only to be heard from several days later as boreal\r\nravagers of Northern Europe.\r\n\r\nThe great anti-cyclones that constitute the American cold waves drift\r\ninto our territory from Canadian Northwest provinces, and are studied\r\nunder rapidly changing conditions during three thousand miles of\r\ntheir course.\r\n\r\nWest Indian hurricanes, at sea level and in humid air, which are\r\nthe most violent of all storms except the American tornado, intrude\r\nthemselves into the domain covered by the weather map at Florida or\r\nthe East Gulf coast and usually pass off to the northeast with high\r\nwinds skirting our southern coast stations.\r\n\r\n=Permanent Highs and Lows in the Pacific Are Great Centers of\r\nAction.= Near the end of Chapter XII reference is made to the fact\r\nthat there is a barrier in the Pacific Ocean that interferes with the\r\nmovement of storms from the Orient, but which does not entirely stop\r\ntheir progress. Extensive Highs and Lows, sometimes called “Centers\r\nof Action” because they do not migrate like the traveling Highs and\r\nLows that cause the alternations of weather that we experience from\r\nday to day, are also called Sub-permanent Highs and Lows. They are\r\nthe parent systems out of which come many of the Highs and Lows that\r\ncross the North American continent, and they act as a bar to the free\r\npassage of storms from the Far East. As these Sub-permanent areas\r\nshift their centers a little to the north or to the south they change\r\nthe character and the line of movement of the storms and cool waves\r\nthat come to us, and they alter the general character of the weather\r\nfor thousands of miles to the east of them. In the region of Iceland\r\nis the center of an extensive Sub-permanent Low that has much to do\r\nin controlling the weather of Europe, and there is a Sub-permanent\r\nHigh central at or near Bermuda in the southern part of the North\r\nAtlantic Ocean. Whenever the latter is built up by having a migrating\r\nHigh from the North American continent join with it, the whole\r\nUnited States experiences what is called a “hot wave”, and the heat\r\ncontinues as long as this Sub-permanent High remains unusually high\r\nand extends its western limits to include our South Atlantic States.\r\n\r\nThe matter in the foregoing paragraph is so important that it will\r\nbe restated in slightly different form: Whenever either the High\r\nor the Low Center of Action (Sub-permanent High and Low), out of\r\nwhich comes nearly all of the migrating Highs and Lows, shifts its\r\nnormal seasonal position, then storms are erratic and unusual weather\r\noccurs over the North American continent and farther eastward. The\r\nreason why much the greater number of the storms that cross the\r\nUnited States, the Atlantic Ocean, and Europe originate either in\r\nour Rockies, the Canadian Northwest, or just off the Alaskan coast\r\nis due to the fact (Chart 1, page 99) that the Low center of action\r\nis normally over the middle and northern Rocky Mountain plateau in\r\nsummer, and over the Aleutian Islands (Chart 2, page 100) in winter.\r\nThe High that follows the migrating Low in winter either separates\r\nfrom the center of action central over the Canadian Rockies (Chart\r\n2), or from the one central at Honolulu; if from the latter, the\r\nweather will be simply cooler after the passage of the Low, but if\r\nthe High separates from the center of action in the Canadian Rockies\r\nit will constitute a cold wave as it follows a Low southeastward into\r\nthe interior of the United States and then eastward to the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nCLIMATE\r\n\r\n  CHANGE OF SOLAR RAYS INTO LIGHT, HEAT, AND OTHER FORMS OF ENERGY\r\n  AS THEY ARE ABSORBED BY OUR ATMOSPHERE OR AS THEY ENCOUNTER THE\r\n  EARTH—TEMPERATURES OF WATER, EARTH, AND AIR—HOW SANITARY HOMES\r\n  MAY BE CHEAPLY CONSTRUCTED BELOW GROUND, COOL IN SUMMER AND WARM\r\n  IN WINTER\r\n\r\n\r\n=Difference between Climate and Weather.= One may speak of the\r\nweather of to-day or of some time that is past, but not of the\r\nclimate of to-day, or of any day, month, or year that is gone: for\r\nthe climate of a place is determined by a study of its weather\r\nrecords for a long period of years. Climate changes so slowly that\r\nwe speak of the movement as a mutation rather than as a change. The\r\ntime that has elapsed since the discovery of the barometer and the\r\nthermometer—about two and a half centuries—is so short as to show\r\nlittle if any change in climate, while the weather changes from day\r\nto day.\r\n\r\n=The Sun Our Only Source of Appreciable Heat.= Each one of the stars\r\nvisible to the eye and many of the millions that are not visible, are\r\nsuns accompanied by planets. Their conditions are similar to those\r\nof our sun, except that most of them are larger than our sun, some\r\na million times larger. But their distance is so great that they\r\nexercise little or no influence in the heating of the earth. Light\r\ntravels at about the rate of 186,400 miles per second, and yet these\r\nstars are so distant that if the nearest one had been created at the\r\ntime of the signing of the Declaration of Independence we still would\r\nbe in ignorance of its existence, for its first rays of light would\r\nnot reach us for many years yet to come; and light from some of the\r\nremote suns that we call stars requires thousands of years to come.\r\nIt is apparent therefore that we depend exclusively upon our own\r\nluminary for the heat that warms our atmosphere and gives life to the\r\nsurface of the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—Equinoxes, March 21 and September 22. Axis\r\nperpendicular to Sun’s rays. Day and night everywhere equal.]\r\n\r\n=Different Temperatures with the Same Quantity of Solar Heat.= On\r\nthe same day of each year at the same place practically the same\r\namount of heat falls upon and into the earth’s atmosphere from the\r\nsun, but rarely does the same temperature and weather occur, and\r\noften there is wide variation in the weather of the same day of two\r\ndifferent years. The first of July may be cold enough to wear an\r\novercoat at midday, or the first of January may be so temperate as\r\nto permit the donning of summer habiliments, while, according to the\r\namount of heat received from the sun, there would have occurred the\r\nusual seasonal conditions on the days named had there been no other\r\ninfluence than the direct action of the sun’s heat. The cause of\r\nthese seeming inconsistencies is due to the motions of the atmosphere\r\nin a stratum only five to seven miles in depth, air cooling by\r\nexpansion as it ascends in cyclonic whirls and heating as it descends\r\nin anti-cyclonic movements. Condensation, in the form of cloud or\r\nrain or snow, also introduces complications, usually producing a\r\ncooling effect in summer and a warming in winter. In other words:\r\ninterference in the uniform and gradual change in temperature, of\r\nthe lower stratum of air in which we live, from the heat of summer\r\nto the cold of winter, and then the reverse process, is due entirely\r\nto the heating and the cooling of the lower air by its upward and\r\ndownward motions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—Summer Solstice, June 21. North Pole leans\r\ntowards Sun’s rays.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—Winter Solstice, December 21. North Pole is\r\ndark now instead of light, as at Summer Solstice. Pole leans in same\r\ndirection but Earth being on opposite side of its orbit rays come\r\nfrom opposite direction. Refer to Figure 24.]\r\n\r\nIf the earth’s axis were vertical to the plane of its orbit all\r\nplaces on its surface always would have days of twelve hours each\r\nand the nights would be of the same length; sunshine would just\r\ntouch both poles (Figure 21) throughout the entire course of the\r\nearth around the sun and there would be no seasons. One would need\r\nto change one’s location on the earth in order to get a change of\r\nweather, which would be monotonous and quite different from the\r\nactive conditions of the atmosphere that we now enjoy. The whole\r\nconditions of life would be altered for the worse. You have seen a\r\ntop tilt over to one side as it spun on the floor. In the same way\r\nthe earth spins on its axis as it pursues its course around the sun\r\nwithout changing the direction towards which its axis points, as\r\nshown by Figure 24.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—Note that direction of axis does not change\r\nas Earth moves around Sun. This causes variation in area of surface\r\nilluminated. If axis were perpendicular to plane of orbit there would\r\nbe no seasons.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—As angle of incidence decreases from 90° to\r\n10° the heat received on upper end of blocks is spread over greater\r\narea at bottom, and its temperature diminished. (Abbe.)]\r\n\r\nThe intensity of the sun’s rays at sunrise and at sunset is less than\r\nat midday because the quantity of heat received at the outer limits\r\nof the atmosphere on a given area, as for instance at the area of\r\nthe upper ends of the blocks in Figure 25, passes through a deeper\r\nstratum of air the lower the angle of incidence, and because it is\r\ndistributed over a larger area when it reaches the surface of the\r\nearth.\r\n\r\nAs the heat of day increases from morning until midday and then\r\ndecreases, so does the heat of the year increase from midwinter\r\nto midsummer and then decrease, and for the same reason: change\r\nin obliquity of the sun’s rays, to which must be added change in\r\ndistance from the central luminary. Figure 26 shows that the sun\r\nreaches its greatest midday altitude on June 21st and its least on\r\nDecember 21st.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—Observer at center of picture at latitude\r\n45°. Showing altitude attained by the Sun at midday and length of its\r\ntrack above the horizon at the Summer and Winter Solstices and at the\r\ntwo Equinoxes.]\r\n\r\n=Solar Rays Absorbed by the Atmosphere.= The atmosphere of the earth\r\nabsorbs about seventy-six per cent. of the solar rays that pass\r\nthrough it. About one half is absorbed by a cloudless atmosphere,\r\nand nearly all is absorbed or reflected away by a cloudy air. On the\r\naverage about fifty-two per cent. of the earth’s surface is obscured\r\nby clouds all the time, which reduces the total amount of heat that\r\nreaches the earth to but twenty-four per cent. But in regions like\r\nthe high plateau of the Rocky Mountains, where there is little\r\ncloudiness or moisture in the air, fully fifty per cent. reach the\r\nearth. At the equator, when the sun is in the zenith at noon, the\r\nrays strike the earth perpendicularly and reach the earth through\r\nthe shortest air distance possible; but for latitudes far north or\r\nsouth of the equator, the rays are more oblique and must pass through\r\nan ever-increasing thickness of air as the latitude increases.\r\nConsequently the heat that reaches the earth at high latitudes\r\ndecreases, not only on account of the greater obliquity of the sun’s\r\nrays, but also because of the longer path of atmosphere traversed,\r\nwhich causes a further loss by absorption.\r\n\r\n=The Lag of Earth Temperatures.= The solar rays reach their greatest\r\nintensity on June 21st, in the Northern Hemisphere, when the sun\r\nattains the farthest point north, and the obliquity of its rays is\r\nthe least, but the highest temperature of the air for the year does\r\nnot occur on the average for a month or six weeks later, due to the\r\ncapacity of the earth and air to absorb heat; and the maximum for the\r\nearth does not occur until still later. The sun is the farthest south\r\non December 21st, but the minimum air temperature of the year, on the\r\naverage, does not occur until a month later, and at a later period in\r\nthe earth. At Munich, Bavaria, at a depth of four feet, the minimum\r\nannual temperature occurs on the 2d of March, and the maximum on the\r\n24th of August. For each increase of four feet in depth the time\r\nof occurrence of either maximum or minimum temperature is retarded\r\ntwenty-one days, the minimum not occurring until the 23d of May at\r\na depth of 20.2°, and the maximum being retarded until the 17th of\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n=Annual Range in Air Temperature.= The difference in temperature\r\nbetween winter and summer increases from the equator northward and\r\nfrom all oceans toward the interior of continents, and is greater\r\nin the middle latitudes on the eastern side of large bodies of land\r\nthan on their western side. Yakutsk, Siberia, has experienced 80°\r\nbelow zero in January and 102° above in July, making a range of 182°.\r\nDawson, Canada, has a record of 68° below for winter and 94° above\r\nfor summer, making a range of 162°. In marked contrast with these\r\nlarge differences, shown in the northern interior of continents, is\r\nthe annual range at Samoa, from a maximum of 92° to a minimum of 62°,\r\na range for the year of only 30° for this island of the Pacific,\r\nlocated near the equator.\r\n\r\n=Reversal of the Seasons in the Two Hemispheres.= The summer is\r\nshorter in the Southern Hemisphere than in the Northern and the\r\nwinter is longer, but the Southern Hemisphere is nearer to the sun in\r\nthe summer and farther away in winter, conditions that tend to add to\r\nthe extremes of both seasons. Because of the slowness of the earth\r\nin passing through one half of its orbit, the northern summer lasts\r\nninety-three days, while that of the Southern Hemisphere lasts but\r\neighty-nine days. The result is that during like seasons and during\r\nthe whole year the two hemispheres receive exactly the same quantity\r\nof heat.\r\n\r\n=Only Water Vapor Protects the Earth from Death by Freezing.=\r\nIn Chapter IV you are told that the earth is surrounded by four\r\natmospheres that conduct themselves each quite independently of the\r\nothers, and that water vapor (aqueous vapor) is one of them. Water\r\nvapor plays the most important part in absorbing incoming rays and\r\nin absorbing and reflecting back outgoing heat rays from the earth.\r\nWithout the vaporous atmosphere the sun’s rays would be but slightly\r\nabsorbed as they entered and radiation from the earth would readily\r\nescape through the atmosphere to outer space. No matter how fiercely\r\nthe sun might shine, life on the earth would be entirely destroyed by\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nWhen water vapor, clouds, or dust motes intercept certain portions\r\nof the sun’s rays, they change them from vibrations in ether to\r\nthe motions of molecules, and the motions of these molecules are\r\nexpressed in a rise in temperature in the vapor, cloud, or dust.\r\nEarth radiations of heat, having longer and slower wave lengths\r\nthan those that come from the sun, are more readily absorbed by the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal functions of the atmosphere is to protect the\r\nearth from the intense cold of outer space, which must be near or at\r\nabsolute zero—459° below the zero mark.\r\n\r\n=Why Should Not Mountain Peaks Be Warm? They Are Nearer the Sun.= The\r\nabsorption by the atmosphere of both solar and terrestrial radiation\r\nis greater in the lower levels of the air, where water vapor, cloud,\r\nand dust are the densest, while the transmission of both incoming and\r\noutgoing radiation is more rapid through the pure air aloft. Thus we\r\naccount for the coolness of all mountain peaks, and the perpetual\r\nfreezing temperatures of some, even though they be located in the\r\ntropics, and though their tops occupy positions several miles nearer\r\nthe sun than the bases from which they rise.\r\n\r\n=How the Earth Cools at Night.= Radiation from the earth goes on\r\nday and night, winter and summer. During daylight the gain of heat\r\nis greater than the loss, while at night the reverse is true. After\r\nsunset both the earth and the air continue to cool by radiation\r\nunchecked by the incoming heat of the daytime. The earth loses heat,\r\neven under a clear sky, more freely than the air, with the result\r\nthat the surface of the ground and of vegetation may fall to a\r\ntemperature ten to fifteen degrees lower than that of the air at a\r\nfew hundred feet elevation. This condition is called “temperature\r\ninversion.” The greater difference will occur when there is little\r\nwind to mix the air. On a clear night the radiation outward will be\r\nrapid; then, if the wind be light, there may occur an increase in\r\ntemperature up to a height of two hundred to four hundred feet, and\r\nthen a fall, reaching the surface temperature at about two thousand\r\nfeet elevation, unless the ground be wet, or the location be adjacent\r\nto a considerable body of water.\r\n\r\n=A Cloud Covering Cools by Day and Warms by Night.= One of the\r\nprincipal functions of clouds is to conserve the heat of the sun. A\r\ncovering of cloud, fog, or dense haze may not only screen off the\r\nheat of day, but greatly retard the lowering of temperature at night\r\nby reflecting and radiating back to the ground much of the heat that\r\nit has lost.\r\n\r\n=The Temperature of Oceans, Lakes, and Rivers.= The same quantity\r\nof heat falling upon different kinds of matter produces different\r\ntemperatures, depending on the capacity (specific heat) of each kind\r\nof matter to absorb or hold heat; this is notably apparent when\r\nthe matter is land, water, or air; for the same quantity of heat\r\nwill raise the temperature of a water surface only about one fourth\r\nas much as it will a land surface. Water rejects by reflection a\r\nconsiderable amount of the solar rays that fall upon it, while land\r\nreflects but a small part; and of that which is received upon the top\r\nlayer of water much is rendered latent in the process of evaporation\r\nand does not impart warmth to the water. Solar rays also penetrate\r\nwater to a considerable depth and are quite uniformly absorbed by the\r\nwhole stratum penetrated. These conditions cause large water surfaces\r\nand the air immediately over them to have a much lower temperature\r\nduring the day and a much higher temperature during the night; and\r\nalso lower temperatures during summer and higher temperatures during\r\nwinter, than occur over a land surface of the same latitude.\r\n\r\n=Fresh Water and Salt Water Have Different Freezing Temperatures.= In\r\nthe ratio of 93.5 to 100 the specific heat of sea water is less than\r\nthat of fresh water. Sea water is a better conductor of heat, so that\r\nit penetrates to a greater depth in salt water in the same period of\r\ntime than it does in fresh water. Sea water regularly contracts with\r\nfalling temperature until its greatest density occurs at four degrees\r\nbelow freezing, when it becomes solid ice and expands in the process\r\nof freezing; otherwise it would not float.\r\n\r\n=A Wonderful Phenomenon.= In this respect a most wonderful and\r\nunexplainable phenomenon occurs with regard to fresh water. Not only\r\nsea water but practically all other forms of matter—liquid, solid,\r\nand gaseous—expand with increasing heat and contract with decreasing\r\nheat, except fresh water between 39° and 32°, which actually expands\r\nwith falling temperature. It seems as though the Creator had gone\r\nover His work and made revisions and corrections here and there, for\r\nunless the law with regard to the contraction of liquids with falling\r\ntemperatures had been reversed for fresh water between 39° and 32°\r\nour rivulets, streams, lakes, and rivers would freeze from the bottom\r\nupward and the life of inland water be wholly or partly destroyed.\r\n\r\nEven more calamitous would be the floods of springtime, for melting\r\nsnows and falling rains would spread over and erode the cultivated\r\nfields of the husbandman instead of being carried away by the open\r\nchannels of streams, as is largely done now.\r\n\r\n=The Freezing of Fresh and of Salt Bodies of Water.= The freezing of\r\nwater does not take place upon the surface of water only, as many\r\nsuppose. Congelation takes place about millions of minute atoms of\r\nmatter carried by the water in suspension. Water expands in the\r\nprocess of freezing and each particle of ice, no matter in what part\r\nof the body of water it is formed, immediately rises to the surface\r\nbecause of the gain in its buoyance as it changes from the liquid to\r\nthe solid form.\r\n\r\nWhen the surface of water cools by radiation to a cooler air it\r\ngains in specific gravity and sinks and warmer water comes up to\r\ntake its place and in turn be cooled and sink; thus a circulation is\r\nestablished which continues in fresh water until every part of the\r\nbody of water has fallen to 39° and in salt water to 28°. At these\r\ntemperatures the two waters reach their maximum density. With the\r\nfurther cooling of salt water particles of ice form and rise to the\r\ntop, as already described. With the cooling of fresh water below 39°\r\nthe law that holds good for all higher temperatures is reversed and\r\nexpansion of volume begins, which continues until 32° is reached.\r\nTherefore, fresh water of any temperature between 39° and 32° may\r\nfloat upon water that is considerably warmer; in fact, it has less\r\nspecific gravity at 32° than at 46°. At 32° that which was a liquid\r\nbecomes a solid and still further suddenly expands its volume.\r\n\r\n=The Cold of Ocean Bottoms.= Few have any idea of the enormous volume\r\nof cold water that lies upon the surface of the earth, three fourths\r\nof which is covered with oceans whose depths average two miles and\r\nin many places are five miles. Below one mile in depth these oceans\r\nare always at about the freezing point of salt water, which is 28°,\r\nexcept in the tropics, where it is but little warmer, varying between\r\n34° and 36°.\r\n\r\n=How Temperatures of Inclosed Seas Differ from Those of Oceans.= We\r\nwill take the Red Sea as an example. It is 180 miles wide and extends\r\nin a nearly north and south direction for 1450 miles, about one half\r\nof it lying within the tropics. Evaporation takes place at a rapid\r\nrate, but only the surface water of the Indian Ocean on the south\r\nis able to enter to take the place of that which is lost, for a bar\r\nor sill at the entrance, extending from the bottom to within twelve\r\nhundred feet of the surface, separates the deep water of the sea from\r\nthat of the outside ocean. Its surface temperatures vary about as\r\nthe Indian Ocean, being 85° in summer and 70° in winter. Both bodies\r\nof water decrease in temperature at about the same rate down to the\r\nlevel of the sill, where the temperature remains constant the year\r\nthrough at 70°. Here a marked difference occurs, for the sea, which\r\nhas a depth of 7200 feet, maintains the same temperature of 70° all\r\nthe way down to the bottom; while the ocean continues to decrease\r\nin temperature down to a depth of about six thousand feet, where a\r\ntemperature of 34° to 36° prevails throughout the year. A similar\r\ncondition exists with relation to the Mediterranean and the Atlantic\r\nOcean. At the top of the sill, which is 1140 feet below the surface,\r\nthe temperature of both bodies is 55°, and this degree of heat is\r\nmaintained all the way down to the bottom of the Mediterranean,\r\nwhile in the Atlantic Ocean, at the same depth as the bottom of the\r\nMediterranean, the temperature is only 35°.\r\n\r\n=How the Temperature of Water Changes with Latitude, Season, and\r\nDepth.= It is impossible to name a given temperature as prevailing\r\nover bodies of water at all places on the same parallel of latitude,\r\nbecause ocean currents soon move water heated in one latitude to a\r\nhigher or a lower position. At the equator the surface temperature is\r\nbetween 82° and 84°; it changes less than one degree between day and\r\nnight, and not over five degrees between winter and summer; and below\r\ntwenty-four hundred feet there is no difference between the seasons,\r\nthe daily variation ceasing at less than a hundred feet. Below six\r\nthousand feet the temperature is always near the freezing point of\r\nfresh water.\r\n\r\nIn the middle latitudes the surface variation is from 50° in winter\r\nto 68° in summer.\r\n\r\nAt latitude 70° N. the surface temperature has but a small daily\r\nvariation, and a yearly range of from 35° for winter to 45° for\r\nsummer; at a depth of twenty-four hundred feet it remains steady at\r\n32°.\r\n\r\nFrom this level there is a gradual decrease to a depth of six\r\nthousand feet, where a constant temperature of 28° exists, and below\r\nthis there is no change. The temperature of Lake Superior decreases\r\ndown to a depth of two hundred forty feet, where a temperature of 39°\r\ncontinues throughout the year, as it does downward for the remainder\r\nof the distance to the bottom, which has an average depth of nine\r\nhundred feet.\r\n\r\n=Direction of Wind Affects Shore Temperature of Water.= Onshore winds\r\nskim off the warm surface water and drive it shoreward, where it\r\nbanks up, and, pressing downward, causes the colder water beneath to\r\nflow back seaward. In like manner, offshore winds blow off the top\r\nwater near the shore and send it out to sea, and colder water rises\r\nto take its place.\r\n\r\n=Great Heat of the Earth’s Interior.= We are ignorant of the\r\nconditions of matter under the heating effect of the enormous\r\npressure that exists near the center of the earth, but it is probable\r\nthat pressure prevents it from changing from a solid to a liquid or a\r\ngaseous form. The surface of the solid earth rises to a much higher\r\ntemperature as the solar rays fall upon it than does a water surface,\r\nor the air immediately above, because it is a poor reflector, a poor\r\nconductor, and a poor radiator, and when dry does not get any cooling\r\neffect from evaporation. Solar heat ceases to be apparent at a depth\r\nthat varies with the latitude and the conditions of the soil with\r\nregard to moisture and specific heat, but everywhere at less than\r\nfifty feet.\r\n\r\nAt the poles and for some distance away the earth is covered with ice\r\nor snow the entire year and is frozen to a considerable depth. In\r\nthe interior of Siberia and some parts of Alaska only a thin stratum\r\nof soil thaws out under the heat of summer. Beginning at about fifty\r\nfeet, there is an increase of temperature downward, but it is not\r\nthe same for all places, varying from a degree for forty feet to a\r\ndegree for one hundred feet. Taking the average of the increase with\r\ndepth, water would boil at ninety-five hundred feet and the hardest\r\nrock be molten at thirty miles. At a depth of 3490 feet near Berlin,\r\nthe temperature was found to be 116°, while it was only 108° at the\r\nsame depth at Wheeling, West Virginia, and in both places there is no\r\nchange from day to night or from winter to summer.\r\n\r\n=Soil Usually Warmer Than Air Next Above.= In summer, June to August,\r\nthe bare, dry, top soil is warmer than the air ten feet above during\r\nall hours of the day and night, at times the difference being as much\r\nas forty degrees at midday. During winter, December to February, it\r\nis slightly cooler, except between 9 A.M. and 3 P.M. when the excess\r\nis seldom more than ten degrees. Evaporation from a wet soil lowers\r\nits temperature below that of the air immediately above through the\r\nrendering latent of a large quantity of heat. A melting snow surface\r\nalso is below the temperature of the air because of the heat employed\r\nin changing the snow to the liquid form.\r\n\r\n=Let Mother Earth Cool and Refresh You During the Heat of Summer.=\r\nHow little the average man realizes the possibilities for improving\r\nhis condition that lie close at hand. He does not know, or he is\r\nindifferent to the fact, that only three feet from the surface of\r\nthe ground it is as cool at midday as at midnight, and that there is\r\nno diurnal variation in temperature below that depth, and no annual\r\nvariation below a depth of from thirty to forty feet. If one were\r\nto set down the temperature of each day, add the numbers at the end\r\nof the year, and divide the sum by 365 the quotient would equal the\r\ntemperature always found at that place at a depth of about thirty\r\nfeet. The temperature of a deep-flowing spring is always about the\r\nmean annual air temperature of the place. Here is health-giving\r\ncoolness for summer and warmth for winter of which one takes little\r\nheed and derives practically no profit.\r\n\r\nRemarkable, is it not? And these beneficent conditions are universal\r\nand available for all, except to those crowded into congested centers\r\nof population. The temperature is 54° in the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky\r\nand shows no change from day to day and from winter to summer.\r\n\r\nDuring the extreme heat of summer and the cold of winter many could\r\nprofitably, healthfully, and pleasantly live below ground. During\r\nsuch periods the cellar of the house, which should be deep and\r\nspacious, even extending beyond the dimensions of the edifice above,\r\nif a continuous supply of pure air could be forced through it, or\r\nnatural ventilation accomplished by the plan outlined below, should\r\nbe the lounging, resting, and sleeping place of the occupants of the\r\nhousehold. It is not impossible or extremely difficult to change the\r\nstagnant, moist, germ-laden, ill-smelling air of the average cellar,\r\nin which it is positively dangerous to spend much time, into active,\r\npure, and delightfully healthful air,—air in which the worn and\r\nweary worker from the heat of the farmer’s field, or the artisan and\r\nthe clerk from the debilitating temperatures of the factory and the\r\noffice could recuperate from the toil of the day, and from which they\r\nwould go forth each morning invigorated for another day’s efficient\r\nservice, instead of dragging weary limbs from hot, sleepless beds,\r\neach morning less in energy than the day before. As is shown in\r\nother parts of this book, the researches of Huntington have proven\r\nconclusively that man is at his lowest physical and mental points of\r\nefficiency, and more subject to the contraction of disease through\r\nweakness, in midsummer and midwinter, and that the hotter the summer\r\nand the colder the winter the less is his energy and the lower is his\r\npower of resistance.\r\n\r\nThe whole problem is one of ventilation. While this is simple, it\r\nmust be scientifically done. The ideal location for a living cellar\r\nis a hillside. It is easy to install ventilators in the roof of a\r\ncellar no matter where located, but these are of no avail whatever\r\nif there is not adequate air drainage at the bottom of the cellar.\r\nFrom the cellar in a hillside a conduit can lead from the bottom\r\nof the inclosure and have its opening at a lower level, thereby\r\naccomplishing drainage and circulation, which are all-important in\r\nthe creating of a sanitary condition of air under the cool earth. For\r\neach thousand cubic feet of cellar space there should project from\r\nthe roof, to a height of at least six feet above ground, a separate\r\nventilator shaft of at least one square foot cross-section dimension.\r\nA like ventilating capacity should be provided from the bottom\r\noutward to a lower level, but here two or more shafts may be combined\r\nin one, so the proper capacity is secured. During the day the draft\r\nwill be upward through this system. But at night, except when the\r\nwind is brisk, the direction of movement of the air is reversed, and\r\nthe cool air of the minimum temperature of night or early morning,\r\nbecause of its greater density, drops down into the cellar. The\r\ndrainage shaft should be provided with a damper, which should be\r\nclosed in the early morning, about daybreak, entrapping the cold air\r\nof night. The lower opening should be covered with wire netting, to\r\nexclude small animals, and the whole construction be of concrete,\r\nrendering it imperishable and rat-proof.\r\n\r\n=Inexpensive but Efficient Cold Storage.= Such a sanitary cellar\r\nas described above provides an excellent storage for fruits and\r\nvegetables, comparing favorably with the much more expensive\r\nartificial refrigeration. By an intelligent manipulation of the\r\ndamper in the lower shaft, cool storage may be provided for fruit and\r\nother produce in the early fall, and protection secured against the\r\nextreme cold of winter.\r\n\r\n=Why Does Air Cool with Ascent and Heat with Descent?= If a mass of\r\nair be elevated 183 feet it will be found to have lost one degree in\r\ntemperature, because there is less air above to exert pressure upon\r\nit and it therefore expands to greater volume, and in the process\r\nof expansion work is performed which employs heat and renders it\r\nlatent. One minute, one hour, or a thousand years thereafter, if this\r\nsame air be lowered to its former elevation, it will be compressed\r\ninto its previous dimensions and the heat energy that formerly was\r\nemployed to expand it will be restored to the sensible condition.\r\nThis ratio of 183 feet to one degree does not hold for any extended\r\nmovement, because, as soon as the dew point of the air is reached,\r\ncondensation in the form of cloud or rain occurs and the heat of\r\ncondensation is released; that is to say, the same quantity of heat\r\nemployed to create the water vapor at some previous time and thereby\r\nrendered latent is now become sensible and partly makes up for the\r\nloss by expansion as the air ascends. The average is therefore about\r\nthree hundred feet for one degree.\r\n\r\n=Height of Freezing Cold in the Free Air.= The frost level remains\r\nconstant, winter and summer, over the equator at about eighteen\r\nthousand feet. Elsewhere this level rises and falls with the seasons,\r\nthe amplitude of the movement increasing with latitude and being\r\ngreater over land than over water on the same parallel.\r\n\r\n=Daily Range of Temperature in the Free Air.= The difference between\r\nthe temperature of day and that of night decreases with altitude\r\nin the free air and ceases at about eight thousand feet. It is\r\ngreatest during clear weather and least in cloudy weather. Narrow\r\nvalleys may show a greater daily range than hilltops. When the sky\r\nis clear, radiation from the hillsides may heat the air in a valley\r\nto almost furnace heat at midday, while at night the air, coming in\r\ncontact with cool vegetation higher up, chills and, gaining in weight\r\nby contraction, flows down and collects in the valley, making the\r\nbottom of the valley warmer during day and colder during night than\r\nthe air above. Often moisture-laden winds precipitate much of their\r\nwater vapor as the air cools by expansion in passing over a mountain\r\nrange. These winds carry a comparatively dry air over to the leeward\r\nside of the mountain, where the daily range of temperature will be\r\nmuch greater than on the windward side at the same elevation. San\r\nFrancisco, where the prevailing winds come from the ocean, has a less\r\nrange than New York, where the predominating winds are from the land;\r\nbut New York is influenced by its proximity to the ocean, for its\r\nrange is much less than at Denver, in the interior of the continent.\r\nThe range is less on the east side of Lake Michigan than on the west\r\nside, as it is with relation to all similar bodies of water.\r\n\r\n=Man Soon Adjusts Himself to Changes in Altitude.= In Colonial days\r\nit was noted that horses coming down from the mountains in North\r\nCarolina ran swifter in the races the first day or two after changing\r\nto a lower level. In going to a higher altitude an increase in the\r\nnumber of red corpuscles in the blood enables it to absorb oxygen\r\nmore readily, and thus compensate for the loss in the density of the\r\nair. Because of this gain in the chemical activities of the life\r\ncurrent, one feels a marked increase in strength on coming to a\r\nlower level, but the gain lasts for only a short time before there\r\nis a readjustment to former conditions. Persons with weak hearts may\r\nnot be able to live at an altitude of four thousand feet, and most\r\npeople experience inconvenience, at least, on first reaching ten\r\nthousand feet; but nature is accommodating, and a number of large\r\ncities prosper at altitudes of from one to two miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nHOW CLIMATE IS MODIFIED AND CONTROLLED\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the surface of the earth were all land, and the axis of the\r\nearth’s rotation were perpendicular to the plane of the earth’s\r\norbit, the day and the night would be equal everywhere, and there\r\nwould be no seasons. There would be no wind, for the friction of the\r\nair against the rotating earth would soon cause all levels of the\r\natmosphere to take up the exact easterly velocity of the solid body\r\nbelow. The atmosphere would be contracted by cold and drawn downward\r\nso as to have less depth at the poles than at any place having\r\nlatitude, and it would be deepest at the equator, where the direct\r\nrays of the sun would expand it to an altitude of probably twice\r\nwhat it could have at the poles. Centrifugal force—the force that\r\ncauses mud to fly off the rim of a swiftly rotating wagon wheel—would\r\nfurther lower the height of the atmosphere at the poles and cause\r\nit still more to extend outward at the equator. The atmosphere\r\nwould soon adjust itself to these constant conditions and forces and\r\nthereafter remain at rest relative to the earth. There would be no\r\nlife, for there would be no vaporous atmosphere if the surface all\r\nwere without water. There would be extremely little heat to disturb\r\nthe atmosphere with motion, for the dry gases of the atmosphere are\r\npractically diathermanous, and the heat of the sun would pass out\r\nby radiation from the burnt and parched surface of the earth during\r\ndaytime without imparting more than a minute fraction of its energy\r\nto the atmosphere; and at night the thin surface of the top soil that\r\nhad been heated to a furnace temperature during sunshine would be\r\nquickly locked in the fastnesses of intense cold—probably 200° below\r\nzero.\r\n\r\nIf we now incline the axis of our imaginary earth 23½°, we shall\r\nintroduce seasons whose only change, the one from the other, will be\r\nin the duration of sunlight, as there is no water vapor to absorb\r\nand utilize the sun’s rays in the initiation of motion and the\r\ncreation of storms. We are assuming that there would be enough heat\r\nabsorbed to prevent the atmosphere from liquefying, which it would\r\ndo at any temperature lower than 312° below zero. If the temperature\r\nwere to fall below the liquefying point of air, we would have the\r\nsingular phenomenon of the air expanding to a gas during daylight and\r\ncondensing to a liquid during nighttime, and, of course, that would\r\nmean motion and winds, but of such a nature that one would hardly\r\ndare speculate as to their peculiarities.\r\n\r\nWe introduce these hypothetical cases for the purpose of conveying a\r\nclearer idea of the overlapping of conditions and the combinations of\r\nforces that influence and control the seasons, the climate, and the\r\nweather of the earth.\r\n\r\nIf the surface of the earth were all water and its axis perpendicular\r\nto the plane of its orbit, the day and the night would everywhere\r\nbe equal and there would be no seasons. With a water surface there\r\nwould be an atmosphere nearly if not quite saturated with vapor of\r\nwater, in other words, of practically one hundred per cent. relative\r\nhumidity. It is doubtful if either animal or vegetable life could\r\nexist; the first would die of internal heat, because a saturated air\r\nwould permit of no cooling by evaporation from the pores of the skin,\r\nor from the tongue and mouth of animals that do not perspire; and\r\nthe second could not grow without the chemical action of sunshine,\r\nwhich is a necessary part of the laboratory of the leaf of every\r\ngrowing plant, the sunshine acting upon the green granular matter\r\nwhich constitutes the chlorophyll of the plant. There would be little\r\ndifference between the temperature of day and of night—probably not\r\nmore than one degree. As the earth would everywhere and at all times\r\nbe covered with a deep stratum of cloud there would be little loss of\r\nheat to space by radiation and the temperature would be excessive,\r\nrising in the tropics to near the boiling point. We will assume that\r\nthe atmosphere would reach a stable and unchanged condition of great\r\nheat and humidity and be without motion or precipitation.\r\n\r\nIf now we incline the axis of this water-covered earth and introduce\r\nthe complication of seasons, we shall not only have variation in the\r\nhours of sunshine, increasing as we go from the equator toward the\r\npoles, but, the capacity of air for moisture being less and less with\r\nfalling temperature, we shall have downpours of rain as the summer\r\nslowly merges into fall and the latter into winter. Although the air\r\nwill be saturated, there probably will be no rainfall from the time\r\nwhen the temperature begins to rise after midwinter until it reaches\r\nand passes the maximum heat of summer. It is fair to assume that\r\nduring the rainy period there will be cyclonic storms with torrential\r\nprecipitation, and that the anti-cyclones that are a necessary\r\nconcomitant of cyclones, while they may cause a temporary cessation\r\nof precipitation in the area that they cover, by the dynamic heating\r\nof the air in their downward motions, will be ineffective in fully\r\nclearing away the clouds from a water-covered earth. It is doubtful\r\nif such an earth would be suitable for life,—certainly not for man.\r\n\r\n=The Real Earth of Land, Water, and Inclined Axis.= The different\r\nmanner in which land and water surfaces absorb, radiate, and reflect\r\nthe heat from the sun has a profound influence on climate, which also\r\nis modified by latitude, elevation above sea level, elevation above\r\na valley or above a surrounding plane, direction of wind, height and\r\ntrend of direction of hills and mountains, the position of lakes and\r\ninland seas, the relative position and magnitude of continents and\r\noceans, storm tracks, and ocean currents.\r\n\r\n=Influence of Continents and Oceans on Climate.= Charts 1 and 2\r\n(pages 99 and 100), constructed from observations taken on ships and\r\non land, for a long series of years, show certain Highs and Lows\r\nof vast extent, sometimes called “Centers of Action”, because they\r\ndo not travel across continents and oceans, as do the migrating\r\nHighs and Lows that cause weather. Rather do they slowly reverse\r\ntheir relative positions between winter and summer. Continents\r\ncool by radiation in winter more rapidly than do oceans; the air\r\ncontracts, settles down and grows denser and air flows in at the top\r\nfrom the oceans and outward at the surface of the earth toward the\r\noceans; thus is built up the winter Highs, or centers of action, on\r\ncontinents. Continents heat up by absorption in summer more rapidly\r\nthan do oceans; the air expands, rises, and flows away in the upper\r\nlevels to oceans and flows in at the bottom from the oceans; and\r\nthus are the Lows, or centers of action, established on continents\r\nin summer. It is apparent that these processes must be reversed for\r\nthe oceans, and that the Highs will be found there in the summer and\r\nthe Lows in the winter. Carefully follow the illustrations of these\r\nprinciples by examining the whole region north of the equator on\r\nCharts 1 and 2.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern Hemisphere there is not such a pronounced shifting\r\nof the Highs and the Lows from oceans to continents and back again,\r\nwith change in the seasons, as there is in the Northern Hemisphere,\r\nbecause of the small area of land in comparison with that of water;\r\nbut in the midst of the southern summer, which occurs in January\r\n(Chart 2), Lows are shown over South America, Africa, and Australia.\r\nNote how the winds blow out of all the Highs and into all the Lows.\r\nAlso observe that the winds generally blow from about latitude 30°\r\nnorth and south towards the equator, due to the great heat of the\r\ntropics, which causes the air to rise and in the high levels to flow\r\nnorthward and southward, settling down to the earth again through\r\nthe belts of high pressure that irregularly encircle the earth at\r\nlatitudes 30° north and south.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of continents the temperature falls lower at night\r\nand rises higher during the day, and falls lower in winter and\r\nrises higher in summer than on any of their coasts. On the coast of\r\ncentral California, for instance, the ocean is so cool in summer\r\nand the winds blow so steadily from it that the thermometer ranges\r\nbetween 55° and 70°, even when there are temperatures of over 100°\r\nbut a few hundred miles away in the great interior valleys, or on\r\nthe broad plateaus of the mountains. New York and Boston, in nearly\r\nthe same latitude, also have their summer temperatures modified by\r\nocean influence, but they are on the east side of a broad continent,\r\nwhere the prevailing westerly winds give to them more the character\r\nof a continental climate than one marine; but occasionally the east\r\nwind, for a short time, gives to them the modifying influence of\r\nthe ocean. In the winter the influence of the oceans is to modify the\r\nextremes of cold, the same as they do the excessive heat of summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 12.—AVERAGE MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE FOR JULY\r\n(Henry).]\r\n\r\nChart 8 (page 129) showing the lowest temperatures ever recorded at\r\nWeather Bureau stations, and Chart 12, presenting the average of\r\nthe highest daily temperatures of July, graphically show, clearer\r\nthan any text can describe, the influence of continents and oceans\r\non climate. On the Atlantic the average maximum of day varies from\r\n70° on the Maine coast to 85° on the coast of North Carolina; while\r\non the Pacific, where the marine influence is stronger, the average\r\nis from 65° on the Washington coast to 80° on the coast of southern\r\nCalifornia. But near the center of the United States where the\r\ncontinental influence predominates, the average of the highest daily\r\ntemperatures varies from 85° to 90°. On Chart 8, showing the lowest\r\ntemperatures, the line of 20° below zero passes through Boston,\r\nsouthwest to Chattanooga, west to Flagstaff, Arizona, and then\r\nirregularly north to Seattle, showing the influence of both oceans in\r\ncarrying the line northward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 13.—OCEAN CURRENTS.]\r\n\r\nBecause of the vast extent of the Eurasian (Europe and Asia)\r\ncontinent the difference between continental and marine climates is\r\nmore marked than in the Western Hemisphere. Huntington and Cushing,\r\nin their splendid work on “Principles of Human Geography”,[3] make\r\na comparison between the southern Lofoten Islands, off the coast\r\nof Norway, and Verkhoyansk in Siberia, which probably furnish the\r\ngreatest contrast to be found anywhere between places of the same\r\nlatitude. Although both are inside the Arctic Circle, the influence\r\nof the Atlantic Ocean with its warm-water currents coming all the way\r\nfrom the tropics (Chart 13) protects the Lofoten Islands from the\r\nextreme cold that otherwise would come to them; vegetation remains\r\ngreen and cattle are pastured every month in the year. But the ocean\r\nretains nearly the same temperature in summer as in winter, and\r\nas a result the Islands are too cold to grow trees or many crops.\r\nVerkhoyansk is so different that one can scarcely believe that both\r\nplaces are in the same latitude. At the Siberian town the winter\r\ntemperature falls to 70° or 80° below zero every winter, and has\r\nbeen known to register 90° below zero. It is said that steel skates\r\noften will not “take hold” but slip sideways as well as forward on\r\nthe surface of the excessively cold ice. This doubtless is due to\r\nthe fact that under ordinary winter cold the weight of the skater\r\nmelts a thin film of water under the edge of the skate, which freezes\r\ninstantly when the skate passes and relieves the pressure. But here\r\nthe cold is so intense that the weight of no skater is sufficient\r\nto lubricate his movements with water molecules. Remarkable to\r\nrelate, the summer at Verkhoyansk is warmer than in the islands\r\noff the Norwegian coast, due to the rapidity with which the land\r\nsurface warms up under the action of the solar rays in the midst of\r\na continental area remote from water, 75° to 80° frequently being\r\nrecorded during the long summer days. The ground never thaws for more\r\nthan a foot or so, but a number of crops are successfully grown.\r\n\r\nIn the interior of a continent like that of Siberia or of North\r\nAmerica not only the changes from season to season but from day to\r\nnight are extreme; while in mid-ocean the diurnal and the annual\r\nrange of temperature is small, day and night, winter and summer being\r\nmuch the same. A place is influenced by the ocean in proportion to\r\nits distance from the sea, the presence or the absence of hills or\r\nmountains between the place and the water, and by the fact that the\r\nprevailing winds come from or go to the ocean. Cities as far inland\r\nas Baltimore and Philadelphia have their extremes of temperature\r\nsomewhat modified by the Atlantic Ocean, and if it were not for the\r\nCoastal and the Sierra Nevada Mountains the influence of the Pacific\r\nOcean would be felt at least as far inland as Denver, and the great\r\nRocky Mountain plateau would be one of the garden plots of the world.\r\nThe influence of the Pacific would reach inland farther than now\r\ndoes the Atlantic because of the prevailing westward drift of the\r\natmosphere in all middle latitudes.\r\n\r\n=Exaggeration of the Forest Influence on Climate.= Chapter XIII,\r\non Change of Climate, shows more in detail the process whereby\r\nthe sun lifts up the water vapor from the Gulf of Mexico and the\r\nAtlantic Ocean and how cyclonic storms draw this vaporous atmosphere\r\nnorthwestward far into the interior of the continent, the Alleghany\r\nMountains not being high enough to offer serious obstruction.\r\n\r\nThe writer would again caution the reader not to be misled by any\r\npseudoscientist, no matter how worthy his purpose may be, who\r\nwould teach that the operations of men in changing forest areas\r\nto cultivated fields, gardens, villages, and cities, has in the\r\nslightest degree harmfully affected the climate, or augmented floods\r\nor intensified droughts. A field of grass, of wheat, of corn; an\r\norchard of fruit; a highway bordered with towering, majestic oaks\r\nand elms; or a grove of cultivated trees about a prosperous home\r\nis just as beneficial to the climate as the thickest and most\r\nimpenetrable forest and far more pleasing to the eye and helpful to\r\nmankind. Forests should be protected, conserved, and grown because we\r\nneed timber, not because a lot of foolish people are writing nonsense\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\n=Influence of Lakes and Rivers.= With the exception of contributing\r\nto the formation of occasional fogs over their surfaces and the\r\nadjacent low lands, through the rising of warm water vapor into\r\nthe cold air that often collects at the bottom of valleys during\r\nnighttime, rivers exercise little influence on climate. Lakes exert\r\na modifying influence on the temperature of places near their shores\r\nbut only for a few miles therefrom, and they are too small to exert\r\nany appreciable influence on rainfall. If one examine charts showing\r\nthe average rainfall for the United States by seasons, he will\r\nobserve that the amount gradually shades off as the distance from\r\nthe Gulf or Ocean increases, without any relation whatever to the\r\nfive Great Lakes. Deserts exist on either side of the Caspian Sea,\r\nalthough it slightly increases the rain of the Elburz Mountains to\r\nthe south. If these great bodies of water do not influence the\r\nrainfall, how ridiculous to assume that the changing of forest areas\r\nto other forms of vegetation possibly can affect precipitation or\r\ninfluence droughts. Stress is laid on the fact that some land is left\r\nbare and then is eroded into deep gullies. This is true, but the\r\nfault is one that may be corrected by a proper system of plowing and\r\ncultivation. And at most the area so eroded is so infinitesimal in\r\ncomparison to the vast regions changed from forests to growing crops\r\nas to be negligible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 14.—MEAN ANNUAL ISOTHERMS (Buchan).]\r\n\r\n=Influence of Ocean Currents on Climate.= Climates are markedly\r\ninfluenced by the currents of oceans. Charts 15 and 16 show the\r\nnormal wind circulations of the globe; note that the centers of the\r\ngreat swirls are coincident with the location of the High and the\r\nLow centers of action located on Charts 1 and 2. Next observe Chart\r\n13, showing the ocean currents, and it will be seen at once how\r\nclosely the circulation of the great ocean currents follows that of\r\nthe winds, due to the friction of the air upon the water, and to\r\nthe interposition of bodies of land that turn about or deflect the\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 15.—NORMAL WIND DIRECTION AND VELOCITY FOR\r\nJANUARY AND FEBRUARY (Köppen).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 16.—NORMAL WIND DIRECTION AND VELOCITY FOR JULY\r\nAND AUGUST (Köppen).]\r\n\r\nWater has a greater capacity for heat than nearly any other\r\nsubstance. It requires ten times the quantity of heat to raise a\r\npound of water one degree that it does a pound of iron. The\r\noceans therefore store up vast quantities of the heat of the sun\r\nand, unlike the continents, distribute this heat northward and\r\nsouthward without regard to latitude. Much of the heat of the tropics\r\nis thus transported far northward and southward from the equator.\r\nThe extensive eddy-like circulation of the south half of the North\r\nAtlantic Ocean sends currents northward along the coast of the United\r\nStates which set eastward at latitude 40°. A part of these reach\r\nthe coast of Spain and then turn south; the greater part spread out\r\nin mid-ocean and move northeast, bathing the coasts of the British\r\nIslands, Iceland, and Norway. They still retain some of the heat that\r\nthey absorbed from a tropical sun, and they therefore give to the\r\ncoasts that they reach a higher temperature than they would have if\r\nthe ocean waters were moving from the north, or than they would have\r\nif there were no currents at all. On Chart 14 note how the isothermal\r\nlines are carried northward by these currents as they cross the\r\nAtlantic Ocean. The Gulf Stream mingles with these northeast currents\r\nbut adds little to their temperatures, for the general ocean\r\ncirculation would produce practically the same effects if there were\r\nno Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\nFollow the currents down the coast of Spain and of northeast Africa;\r\nthen note on Chart 14 the southward trend of the lines of equal\r\ntemperature, as the currents bring colder water southward to cool the\r\nair. Next examine the currents of the Pacific and the isothermals.\r\nThe currents moving northward towards the equator along the west\r\ncoast of South America, and those moving southward, also toward the\r\nequator, along the west coast of the United States and Mexico cause\r\na bulging of the isothermal lines from the positions that they would\r\noccupy if there were no currents coming from colder regions.\r\n\r\n=Influence of the Gulf Stream on Climate.= From either side of the\r\nequator the surface winds (Charts 15 and 16) blow the water westward,\r\ncausing what are known as the “Equatorial Currents” (Chart 13).\r\nThe eastward projection of the coast of South America divides the\r\nAtlantic equatorial current into two parts; one goes south along\r\nthe coast of South America and sets up the circulation in the South\r\nAtlantic, which sweeps north along the southwest coast of Africa. The\r\nother passes to the northwest, a part setting up the North Atlantic\r\ncirculation and the remainder sweeping through the Windward Islands\r\nand storing itself in the Gulf of Mexico, whence it is driven out\r\nat a velocity of some five miles per hour through the narrow channel\r\nbetween Key West and Cuba. Here it has a depth of half a mile and a\r\nwidth of forty miles. Its velocity is accelerated because it enters\r\nthe Gulf in a broad sweep and passes out through a constricted\r\nchannel. It retains its individuality as a warm river passing through\r\nthe ocean because of its greater velocity and higher temperature than\r\nthe waters in which it finds itself soon after it leaves the Gulf;\r\nbut it gradually merges with the great Atlantic circulation as it\r\npasses to the middle of the ocean. It is the opinion of the writer\r\nthat its influence on climate has been exaggerated, that the warming\r\nof Europe that is credited to the Gulf Stream is accomplished by\r\nthe mere presence of the ocean to the westward and to the general\r\ncirculation of that ocean without regard to the wonderful phenomenon\r\nknown as the Gulf Stream.\r\n\r\n=Effect of Valleys on Day and Night Temperatures.= Valleys affect\r\ntemperatures in proportion to their depth and width. A deep, narrow\r\nvalley might have the effect illustrated by Figure 27, if the time\r\nwere summer and the sky clear. During the daytime radiation would\r\nwarm the interior so that the bottom of the valley would have a much\r\nhigher temperature than the free air at the top of the valley, and\r\nthe movement of the air would be sluggishly down the center and up\r\nthe sides of the depression. During nighttime all the conditions\r\nwould be reversed. Vegetation, losing heat by radiation much faster\r\nthan the air, would cool the latter as it came in contact with the\r\nsides of the valley. The air would slowly descend along the sides\r\nthrough gain in specific gravity and collect at the bottom with a\r\ntemperature much lower than it had when it started its descent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIGURE 27. Summer day temperature in a narrow valley.\r\n\r\nSummer night temperature in the same valley.]\r\n\r\n=Effect of Mountains on Climate.= The rarity of the atmosphere of\r\nmountains readily allows the rays of the sun to pass through it and\r\nthus the surface of mountains is quickly warmed, but the same\r\nconditions permit a rapid radiation at night, so that there are\r\nconsiderable extremes of temperature. Air cooled by contact with a\r\nmountain may flow down its sides at night and collect in depressions\r\nbelow, often causing frost on still nights where the temperature\r\nhigher up is much above freezing. Mountains may be more cloudy and\r\nrainy than plains, for the currents of air that cross them must rise,\r\nand in rising they cool by expansion and often reach the dew point\r\nof the air, moisture being precipitated in the form of clouds, rain,\r\nor snow. Often a peak is constantly capped with a crown of clouds.\r\nMountains may intercept vapor-bearing winds from oceans, force them\r\nto such an elevation that their vapor is largely precipitated on the\r\nwindward side of the mountain, and receive them on the leeward side\r\nas dry, rainless winds. Vast desert areas are often the result. A\r\ngood example is presented in the case of the Pacific coast mountains\r\nand the desert plateau to the east.\r\n\r\nMountain peaks may be covered with snow, even though they be located\r\nin the tropics, if their elevation be sufficient. This is because the\r\nabsorption of both incoming and outgoing radiation is so much greater\r\nin the lower reaches of the atmosphere, where the water vapor is\r\ndensest. Wherever observations have been made they have shown that\r\nthe temperature of the air on high mountain peaks and crests and for\r\na distance of one to three hundred feet above them is cooler than\r\nadjacent free air of the same height, due to upward deflection of air\r\ncurrents and their cooling by expansion, and to radiation from the\r\npeak.\r\n\r\nThe Himalayan Mountains exercise a profound effect on the climate of\r\nAsia. The monsoon (any wind that alternates annually in direction\r\nor force) of summer brings the moist air from the Bay of Bengal and\r\nprecipitates torrential rains from it as it ascends to higher and\r\nhigher elevations in passing over the great heights of the mountains.\r\nAt a place four thousand feet above the sea and not distant from\r\nCalcutta, the annual rainfall is 466 inches, while the average for\r\nmost of the region east of the Mississippi River is only forty\r\ninches. More than forty inches have been known to fall in one day in\r\nthe Himalayan Mountains. As in the case of all very high mountains,\r\nthe rainfall increases in these mountains up to a certain elevation\r\nand then decreases. North of the mountains the monsoon passes into\r\nthe interior of Asia with withering dryness and vast deserts are the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—Average Monthly Temperature and Rainfall of\r\nTypical Places in North America. (Huntington and Cushing.)]\r\n\r\nFigure 28 graphically presents the average monthly temperature and\r\nrainfall of typical places in North America, and Figure 29 of places\r\nin the Old World. Here may be seen every phase of climate from\r\ntropical to temperate and to cold, and from marine to continental.\r\nBy studying the winds on Charts 15 and 16 and the ocean currents on\r\nChart 13, the reader should be able to find an explanation for the\r\ndifferent conditions shown. For example: Mazatlan and Vera Cruz are\r\nboth on the coast of Mexico, the first on the west and the latter on\r\nthe east. Each has a rainy period in the summer, but at Vera Cruz the\r\nrain begins earlier and lasts later and is much heavier. The reason\r\nis that they both have north winds in winter (Charts 15 and 16), but\r\nin summer Vera Cruz receives winds direct from the Gulf of Mexico and\r\nat Mazatlan the winds continue to blow from the north, with but a\r\nslight inclination landward. Again, the explanation for the fact that\r\nMazatlan has a monthly range of temperature from 60° in winter to 80°\r\nin summer, while Vera Cruz has a range of only 70° to 80° is found in\r\nthe wind direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—Average Monthly Temperatures and Rainfall\r\nof Typical Places in the Old World. (From “Principles of Human\r\nGeography.” John Wiley & Sons.)]\r\n\r\nThe City of Mexico is wonderfully favored by climate. Here a moderate\r\nrainfall occurs from May to September. The oceans are not far distant\r\non either side, as distances are measured continentally, but its\r\ngreat elevation on a table-land relieves it of the torrential rains\r\nusual to the tropics; and yet it is close enough to marine influence\r\nso that its air has not the nerve-irritating dryness of the\r\nplateau of the Rocky Mountains, and it has a remarkable evenness of\r\ntemperature between winter and summer, with a monthly range between\r\n50° and 60°. Its range between day and night is sufficient to be\r\nstimulating.\r\n\r\nStill looking at Figure 28, note the remarkable similarity between\r\nthe climate of Pittsburgh and Toronto. Each has about the same\r\nrainfall and it is almost equally distributed throughout the months\r\nof the year. The only difference is that Toronto is a little colder.\r\nSt. Paul and Kansas City, typical of the climate in the interior\r\ncities, have a small amount of precipitation in winter, considerable\r\nin summer, and a wide range of temperature; while the Pacific coast\r\ncities have dry summers, and winters that vary from three inches of\r\nrain at Los Angeles to fourteen inches at Astoria, with no excesses\r\nin temperature.\r\n\r\n=Temperatures Aloft in the Atmosphere.= Kite and balloon observations\r\nhave not been continued long enough, nor have they been made at\r\na sufficient number of places, to give one the data from which\r\nthe climate of any considerable altitude in the free air may be\r\ndetermined, but from a large number of free balloon observations made\r\nwith self-recording instruments, in the middle latitudes of this and\r\nforeign countries, Figure 1 (page 12) has been constructed, which\r\nshows the manner in which the temperature decreases with elevation up\r\nto eighteen kilometers (eleven miles). Note how rapidly it falls with\r\nelevation up to eleven and a half kilometers (about seven miles).\r\nThis depth of air measures the thickness of the turbulent stratum in\r\nwhich cyclones and anti-cyclones operate. At its top the temperature\r\nalways is about 64° below zero in winter and 70° below in summer.\r\nAnd right here occurs a most wonderful phenomenon,—one of which\r\nscientists were entirely ignorant less than two decades ago. At first\r\nit was thought that there was something wrong with the recording\r\nthermometers, for they failed to register falling temperature\r\nwith gaining altitude after the storm stratum was passed at seven\r\nmiles. Then it was noted that all instruments displayed the same\r\npeculiarity, and the “Isothermal Stratum” (equally heated region)\r\nwas discovered, in which the temperature maintains the same degree\r\nof intense cold so far as exploration had been made. From Mount\r\nWeather, under the direction of the writer, a balloon was flown to\r\nnineteen and one tenth miles before it exploded and sent a parachute\r\ngently down to earth with its precious record. This flight showed\r\npractically no change in temperature after the isothermal stratum was\r\nreached. (See Chapter III.) One is reasonably safe in assuming that\r\nthere is no oxygen beyond an altitude of thirty miles and that at\r\nfifty miles the nitrogen becomes inappreciable, and that, therefore,\r\nthe temperature must shade away to practically nothing when the\r\nvoid of outer space is reached, notwithstanding the presence of the\r\nnewly-discovered isothermal stratum nearer the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCIVILIZATION FOLLOWS THE STORM TRACKS\r\n\r\n  THE MOST DOMINANT RACES—THOSE THAT BEST CO-ORDINATE THE MENTAL\r\n  AND PHYSICAL FACULTIES—ARE FOUND TO EXIST UNDER CERTAIN CLIMATIC\r\n  CONDITIONS—CHANGE THE CLIMATE AND YOU CHANGE THE MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a climate where man needs little protection from the elements,\r\nwhere he may lie upon his back in the shade and with his bare toes\r\npick wild growing fruit to nourish his body, one will find no great\r\nleaders in art, literature, science, statecraft, or industry;\r\nlikewise, in the Arctic, where man simply gathers enough blubber to\r\nsupply his animal wants and then burrows beneath the snows of fierce\r\nwinters, one will not find leadership or creative genius. The regions\r\nof greatest human potential are limited to such portions of the\r\ntemperate zone as have an abundance of rainfall, frequent changes in\r\nthe weather, and an alluvial soil. In other words, the most perfect\r\ncomposite of human resourcefulness is found where nature is neither\r\nso fierce as to crush human aspiration, nor yet so gentle as to lull\r\nhuman desire.\r\n\r\nHumboldt says: “Man is the product of soil and climate; he is brother\r\nto the tree, the rocks, and the animals.” We shall endeavor to show\r\nthat civilization and the greatest human potential follow the storm\r\ntracks of the world, and that climate is the most important factor\r\nin his environment, for without its proper adjustment to his needs\r\nthe richest soil and the most beneficent form of government fail to\r\nbring out the best that is in him. Empire is determined as much by\r\ndirection and force of the wind and changes in the weather as by the\r\nscheming of politicians, the deep-laid plans of diplomats, or the\r\nmarshaling of battalions.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that vigorous man requires is active atmospheric\r\nconditions and in his migrations he follows the climatic lines that\r\nappease his desires. A climate of little change between day and\r\nnight and between winter and summer is soothing and at the same time\r\ndeadening to the human faculties; but changes should be frequent\r\nrather than violent. The daring, the creative, the pioneering, the\r\npersistent spirits of mankind, like snow birds showering themselves\r\nwith icy crystals, revel in the cool air, the perpetual oscillations\r\nof temperature, and the frequent changes from sunshine to cloud that\r\npertain to the regions where storms are most numerous.\r\n\r\nSome days the mind works with a joyous lucidity, the spirits are\r\nhigh and the step elastic and vigorous. On another day the mind is\r\nturbid; it works slowly and hesitates in reaching decisions; one is\r\nlistless and lacking in physical energy. On both days one may be in\r\na perfectly normal physical and mental condition, except for the\r\neffects of the weather.\r\n\r\nUnder the direction of the writer, comparison of the records of\r\ncrimes of violence with the weather records, by officials of the U.\r\nS. Weather Bureau, showed a marked increase of crime of this sort\r\nduring midsummer as against midwinter, and the extremely hot summer\r\nshowed more crime than the cool ones. During recent years Ellsworth\r\nHuntington has made exhaustive and extremely valuable studies of\r\nthe records of piece workers in factories and elsewhere from New\r\nEngland and the Middle Atlantic States down to Florida and the Gulf\r\nof Mexico, and also of the mental activities of the cadets at West\r\nPoint and Annapolis, and of the students in colleges, as shown by\r\ntheir recitation markings.[4] He has compared these records with\r\nthe weather day by day and hour by hour and definitely shown a\r\ndirect relation between variations in the meteorological conditions\r\nand human efficiency. He finds that people’s health and strength\r\nare greatest when the temperature falls to between 56° and 60° at\r\nnight and rises to somewhere between 68° and 72° during the day. He\r\nhas determined the optimum, or, in other words, the meteorological\r\nconditions best suited to man’s health, happiness, and efficiency.\r\nFor mental activity the optimum temperature is much lower than for\r\nphysical. People’s minds are more alert, they reason with greater\r\nanalytic precision, they have greater confidence in their decisions\r\nand they are more optimistic, when the temperature falls to about\r\nfreezing at night and rises to 45° or 50° during the day. Except for\r\nlimited activities, the most efficient man is the one in whom the\r\nmental and physical faculties are most perfectly coördinated. Broadly\r\nspeaking, this agreement may be best accomplished during times when\r\nthe daily temperature ranges between 45° and 65°.\r\n\r\nExcessive humidity in midsummer—eighty per cent. or over—is harmful\r\nand adds enormously to the death rate; on the other hand, some of the\r\nworst colds may come from extreme dryness in summer. It may be found\r\nfeasible to dry the air in sleeping and living rooms in summer when\r\nthe humidity is too high, by closing the apartment and forcing the\r\nair over or through calcium carbide or melting ice and salt. When the\r\nair is kept at 65 to 70 per cent. humidity in winter one will feel\r\ncomfortable in a much lower temperature—about 68°—than when the air\r\nis extremely dry, as it usually is in the average living apartment.\r\nWith a relative humidity of 30 to 40 per cent. which one now often\r\nfinds in warm houses in winter, the temperature may be forced up\r\nto 75° or over and still one may feel cold, because of the rapid\r\nevaporation from the pores of the skin, and the cold created inside\r\nthe clothing by the heat lost in the process of evaporation. Bear in\r\nmind that perspiration is going on at all temperatures, even if one\r\nis unconscious of the fact.\r\n\r\nIn the most populous portions of the United States there are two\r\nperiods of maximum efficiency and two of minimum each year. Let us\r\nconsider that wonderful region including southern New England, the\r\nMiddle Atlantic States, the Ohio Valley, and westward to the Rocky\r\nMountains. Again referring to the records of Huntington we find that\r\nhuman energy is greatest in October; the output of factory, mine, and\r\ncounting room is greater per man than at any other time of the year\r\nand the product of mental effort is greater and of higher quality.\r\nLikewise disease is less and the death rate the least. From this time\r\nthere is a loss in energy until January or February, when vitality\r\nand efficiency may have dropped twenty to thirty per cent. Then there\r\nis a gain until May or early June, when the conditions of health and\r\nefficiency are nearly equal to the most favorable time of the year\r\nin October. Again there is a loss until the middle of July, when a\r\nsecond minimum occurs; physical and mental energy are at a low ebb\r\nand the death rate is high. Diseases are not quite the same as in\r\nwinter, as stomach troubles are more common than colds. The hotter\r\nthe summer and the colder the winter the less favorable are the\r\nconditions of human existence.\r\n\r\nAs there is a certain optimum beyond which diurnal and annual range\r\nof temperature cannot increase without a loss in energy, so there\r\nis a limitation in latitude beyond which the favorable climatic\r\nconditions decrease as one goes northward or southward. As an\r\nexample, Canada and northern Maine have but one unfavorable period,\r\nwhich is the entire winter. The people of these regions are at their\r\ngreatest potential July to September, after which they show a steady\r\ndecline as the severity of the northern winter draws upon their\r\nvitality, until in January and February their minimum is below that\r\nof regions considerably farther south for the same period.\r\n\r\nFrom the most favorable climatic area in the middle latitudes—and\r\nthe entire world possesses none more favorable or of greater extent\r\nthan that possessed by the United States—the loss of health and\r\nstrength due to the enervating effects of heat, high humidity, and\r\ninsufficient temperature oscillations increases as one goes toward\r\nthe equator. In Florida and the southern third of the Gulf States\r\nthere is but one favorable period, the short winter. The enervating\r\nconditions still further are manifest as one proceeds farther\r\nsouthward.\r\n\r\nIn the “Principles of Human Geography”, it is stated that “in Central\r\nFrance and Southern Germany the seasonal variations in health and\r\nstrength are much the same as in Boston, New York, Cleveland, and\r\nDetroit. That is, people are most healthy and strong in October\r\nand early November and again in May and early June, while they are\r\nweakest and most subject to disease in January, February, and early\r\nMarch, and again in July and August. Farther north, for example,\r\nin Scotland, Scandinavia, and Finland, the summer is the best time\r\nof the whole year and the winter the worst. To the south, on the\r\ncontrary, in Italy, Spain, and Greece, the harmful effect of the\r\nwinter decreases and that of summer increases, until finally on the\r\nsouth side of the Mediterranean the winter is much the best time of\r\nthe whole year, while the long summer greatly diminishes the people’s\r\nefficiency and increases disease and death.”\r\n\r\nAs the highest mental activity is coincident with temperatures lower\r\nthan those that induce the greatest physical energy, it naturally\r\nfollows that in the Ohio Valley, southern New England, and the Middle\r\nAtlantic States the mental worker is at his maximum in November\r\ninstead of October, and April instead of May.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 17.—MAP OF CLIMATIC ENERGY. (Huntington and\r\nCushing.)]\r\n\r\nChart 17 shows how human energy would be distributed over the earth\r\nif it depended on climate alone. It is remarkable how almost exactly\r\nit agrees with what we know to be the distribution of the great\r\npolitical power. Japan is meant to be included in the region of high\r\npower, but the scale of the chart is too small to make this plain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHART 18.—DENSITY OF POPULATION IN THE UNITED STATES,\r\n1910.]\r\n\r\nFrom the time when man began to lose his tribal instinct and to\r\nassume national consciousness, in Egypt, the Mesopotamian Valley,\r\nand the region between the Caspian Sea and the Persian Gulf, he\r\nhas been founding empires of more or less enduring nature, and\r\nwith few exceptions has builded towards the west, in the face of\r\nthe prevailing winds. The center of Empire has steadily migrated\r\nalong the paths of greatest storm frequency. Examine Charts 10, 11,\r\nand 18 and note the relation between density of population and the\r\ncloseness of the storm tracks. The figures at the center of each\r\nbrace indicate the number of storms that originated in the region of\r\nthe brace during a ten-year period, and the lines leading from the\r\nbrace show the tracks followed by the centers of the storms. Bear\r\nin mind that each storm covered an area of from five hundred to one\r\nthousand miles in diameter, that it was a vast rotating eddy in the\r\natmosphere, and that its center of rotation followed one of these\r\nstorm tracks. Twelve storms came from the West Indies during these\r\nten Augusts, fifty-seven from the Rocky Mountains and none from the\r\nPacific Ocean; while in the ten Januaries none came from the West\r\nIndies and but twenty-two from the Pacific Ocean. But the point to\r\nwhich your attention is directed is that, no matter what the origin,\r\nthe tendency of each storm was to move towards the Ohio Valley,\r\nPennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and New England. This tendency\r\ngives to these regions the most frequent changes in weather, with\r\nalternations of sunshine and clouds, and changes in temperature and\r\nair pressure—conditions essential to the development of the greatest\r\nhuman potential. Here population is the densest, civilization the\r\nhighest, and the products of man’s brain and hand greater and more\r\ndiversified than elsewhere in this country, and probably than\r\nelsewhere in the world. The United States is abundantly blessed, for\r\nnearly its entire area is under the influence of high atmospheric\r\npotential. Only the region adjacent to the Gulf of Mexico and the\r\nsouthwest is outside of the favored area, and here the conditions are\r\ncharted as medium, and not poor; at least not poor in comparison with\r\nmany more purely tropical regions.\r\n\r\nTo-day the Empire of Human Greatness is centered over the United\r\nStates, that is to say, greatness as expressed in material wealth,\r\npopulation, and homogeneously knit political institutions. Will it\r\ncontinue its westward migration, or will it remain here indefinitely\r\nfor the working out of a civilization higher than yet has come to any\r\nof the nations of the past, or to other of those of the present? So\r\nfar as atmospheric activities have to do with its translation from\r\nplace to place, we may derive comfort from the fact that storm tracks\r\ndo not cross the Pacific Ocean as freely as they do the Atlantic.\r\nIn fact our Rocky Mountains are a barrier to the passage of summer\r\nstorms (Chart 10) and a reference to Chart 11 will show that of\r\nninety-five winter storms that crossed our continent during the ten\r\nJanuaries of which the chart is a record only twenty-two came into\r\nour area from the Pacific; and we know that these twenty-two largely\r\noriginated off our coast somewhere between Hawaii and the Aleutian\r\nIslands. Let us hope that the center of earthly power has reached the\r\nend of its westward journey and that here it shall remain, always\r\nto exercise a just and beneficent influence upon the less favored\r\nportions of the earth.\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to indicate that climate is nearly as important\r\nto animal life as it is to the vegetable existence, and that a cold\r\nclimate, if it be not so extreme as to limit the production of cereal\r\ncrops, and has frequent changes in temperature, pressure, sunshine,\r\nand cloud, favors the development of hardy and resourceful races\r\nof men; in fact, that no dominating race can exist without such\r\nstimulating conditions of climate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nHAS OUR CLIMATE CHANGED?\r\n\r\n  POPULAR OPINION ERRONEOUS, AS THERE IS NO CHANGE WITHIN THE\r\n  PERIOD OF AN INDIVIDUAL LIFE, BUT MOMENTOUS CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED\r\n  SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE CHRISTIAN ERA\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the hallucinations entertained by nearly every adult person\r\nis that the climate has changed since he was young. No matter what\r\nthe scientists may say, he knows that it has changed. Fifty years\r\nago did he not trudge to school for months every winter in snow\r\nknee-deep? Have not the old swimming holes in the brook dried up?\r\nYes, he is a positive witness to an affirmative answer. Even the\r\nriver of his boyhood, whose broad expanse he conquered in a swimming\r\ncontest at the tender age of ten—as he views it after an absence of\r\na quarter-century—has dwindled to little more than a creek, across\r\nwhich one easily may hurl a stone. Talk to him about no change in\r\nclimate. He’s been right on the spot, and knows. For all this, there\r\nhas been no change during the lifetime of this man; nor has there\r\never been during the life period of any individual. Mutations, to be\r\nsure, are going on all the time, but they are so minute that they do\r\nnot accumulate a measurable quantity except in periods of hundreds or\r\nthousands of years. It is not the climate that has changed; it is the\r\nman. The natural action of the stream may have filled the swimming\r\nholes; or the stream may have entirely disappeared through much of\r\nthe contiguous area being brought under cultivation and the water\r\nthat formerly supplied its flow being utilized in the production of\r\ncultivated crops, which actually make use of as much if not more\r\nrainfall than the forest that formerly lined its sinuous banks and\r\ncovered the near-by lowland. And then, snow knee-deep to a boy of ten\r\nhardly comes up to the ankles of a man of six feet two. Again, no one\r\ncan remember the climate of his boyhood; he cannot carry the average\r\nin his mind; all that he can remember are a few instances of unusual\r\nconditions which because of their unusual character left an impress\r\nupon his mind. The river is just as wide as it ever was during the\r\nperiod of his lifetime, or that of his father, or of his grandfather;\r\nbut he has lived on the broad Mississippi for many years, and when\r\nhe goes back to the scenes of his youth, his concept of what\r\nconstitutes a river has undergone a revolutionary change since he\r\nleft the parental roof to go forth and conquer the world.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the personal papers of Thomas Jefferson, in the\r\nState Department at Washington, by an official of the Weather Bureau,\r\nrevealed a number of most interesting incidents in connection with\r\nthe weather observations made by the author of the Declaration of\r\nAmerican Independence. He says:\r\n\r\n  “A change in climate is taking place very sensibly. Both heats\r\n  and colds are becoming much more moderate within the memory of\r\n  even the middle-aged. Snows are less frequent and less deep. They\r\n  do not often lie below the mountains more than one, two, or three\r\n  days, and very rarely a week. The snows are remembered to have\r\n  been more frequent, deep, and of long continuance. The elderly\r\n  inform me that the earth used to be covered with snow about three\r\n  months in every year.”\r\n\r\nBut Jefferson and his neighbors were mistaken. Never during the\r\nperiod of authentic history has the snow covered the ground in\r\nVirginia an average of three months per year, or three months for a\r\nsingle year. These old inhabitants were like those of to-day, who\r\nremember only the abnormalities of climate of twenty-five or fifty\r\nyears ago, and in comparing the unusual conditions of long ago with\r\nthe average of the present time they are deceived. I have known\r\nintelligent and well-meaning persons to declare that they knew from\r\npersonal recollection that the climate of their particular places of\r\nresidence had changed since they were young; that they had stable\r\nlandmarks to show that the streams were drying up, the rainfall\r\ngrowing less, and the winters becoming milder, notwithstanding the\r\nfact that carefully taken observations of temperature and rainfall\r\nfor each day for over one hundred years right at their places of\r\nabode showed no change in climate. We have a continuous daily record\r\nfor one hundred years at New Bedford, Massachusetts, nearly as long\r\nrecords at several other places, and numerous records for over half a\r\ncentury. From these we learn that there has been no definite change\r\nin climate in this country during the past hundred years. There\r\nhave been variations, such as an excess or a deficiency of rainfall\r\nover a considerable area, that have persisted for several years at\r\na time; but in each case the conditions would ultimately come back\r\nto normal, or more often to an extreme of the opposite tendency to\r\nwhat had obtained immediately before. In sections where the rainfall\r\nin bountiful years is barely sufficient for good crops, the people\r\nin the past have been prone to consider that the amount that they\r\nreceive during the periods of excess is that which normally is due\r\nthem, and thus to be unprepared for the dry periods that statistics\r\ntell us must certainly come. The matter of change of climate is\r\nmost important to our sub-arid West,—to the western parts of Texas,\r\nOklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska, and the Dakotas. Some years ago, when the\r\ntide of emigration was strong into these regions, there were several\r\nyears of more than the average rainfall. The coming of population\r\nand the coming of extra rainfall were accidentally coincident, but\r\nthat fact was probably responsible for the popular belief that\r\ncivilization brings an increase in precipitation; that the breaking\r\nof the virgin soil, making it more permeable to the absorption of\r\nmoisture; the planting of trees and the growth of crops, restricting\r\nthe run-off; the roots of the new vegetable life drawing up the\r\nmoisture from below the surface of the ground and transpiring it\r\nto the air through the leaves of plants; the enormous quantities\r\nof water vapor ejected into the air by the combustion necessarily\r\nincident to a considerable population,—all had combined to increase\r\nthe rainfall and render the sub-arid plains more responsive to\r\nthe efforts of the husbandman. No one can fail to regret that this\r\ntheory is not founded upon fact. But a moment’s thought by the\r\nscientist will indicate to him that the volume of air is so great,\r\nand under the heat of the growing period its capacity for moisture so\r\nenormous, that the addition of vapor of water by the processes herein\r\ndescribed, great though it be, is ineffectual to appreciably change\r\nthe amount of the rainfall that nature beforehand had ordained should\r\nbe precipitated.\r\n\r\nThe size of continental areas, the height and the trend of mountain\r\nranges, the proximity of large bodies of water, and the direction\r\nof the prevailing winds are the factors that determine the amount\r\nof the precipitation of a region. Against these the puny efforts of\r\nman, stupendous though we think them to be, are entirely unavailing.\r\nAs an illustration: If the Rocky Mountains were as old as the\r\nAppalachian Chain, and if they were eroded down to the height of the\r\nlatter system, the winds from the Pacific Ocean, when they are drawn\r\ninland by the cyclonic storms of the Rocky Mountain plateau, or of\r\nthe Mississippi Valley, instead of depositing their moisture on the\r\nwest slopes of the first range of mountains, would carry the water\r\nvapor of the Pacific clear to that place in the Mississippi Valley\r\nwhere it would meet the moisture drawn by the same storms from the\r\nGulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. This will appear clear when\r\none understands that cyclonic storms, such as are continually passing\r\nacross our continent in periods of about three days each, may embrace\r\nin their eddy-like circulating systems areas one to three thousand\r\nmiles in diameter, in which the winds from all directions spirally\r\nflow towards the center of the cyclonic system and the system itself\r\nis moving eastward.\r\n\r\nThe water vapor exists as a separate atmosphere from oxygen and\r\nnitrogen. It is screened off from the interior of continents by\r\nmountain ranges because it is condensed and precipitated as rain or\r\nsnow at only moderate elevations. The windward side of mountains may,\r\ntherefore, receive torrential rains while their leeward sides are\r\nentirely without precipitation.\r\n\r\nIt follows that if the Rocky Mountains were lowered as described,\r\nthe entire United States would be green with rich vegetation and\r\nthere would be no deserts anywhere within its broad boundaries. Also,\r\nif the Appalachian Range were as high as the Rocky Mountains—as it\r\nmay have been at one time—and if it extended around the Gulf of\r\nMexico as well as up through our Atlantic Coast States, the vaporous\r\natmosphere of the Atlantic Ocean and of the Gulf of Mexico would be\r\nprevented from entering the interior of the continent, and the power\r\nthat to-day stands as the greatest bulwark of civilization would not\r\nexist. There would be but a narrow fringe of vegetation upon its east\r\nand its west coasts; the interior, with its vast cotton and cereal\r\nplains, would be a barren waste.\r\n\r\nBut to revert for a moment to Jefferson. He took his thermometer to\r\nPhiladelphia when he proceeded there on a mission that would have\r\ncaused any less serene and courageous spirit to forget all the small\r\ndetails of life. When the debates upon which hung the fate of a\r\nnation and, in fact, the lives of those that participated, were in\r\nprogress, he coolly hung his thermometer on the wall and noted down\r\nits readings. Those historians who have described the intense heat\r\nin Independence Hall on the Fourth of July, 1776, were mistaken, as\r\nwill be shown by reference to his observations, the early and the\r\nlate ones of which doubtless were made at his lodgings. They are as\r\nfollows: 6 A.M., 68°; 9 A.M., 72¼°; 1 P.M., 76°; and 9 P.M., 73½°.\r\n\r\nJefferson had one of the only two barometers in this country at that\r\ntime. James Madison (the Bishop, not the President) had the other.\r\nThey took readings at the same hour of the day for a considerable\r\nperiod of time, and Jefferson discovered that changes in the pressure\r\nof the air always began on his instrument a few hours before they\r\ndid on his friend’s instrument a couple of hundred miles to the\r\neast of him. He came near discovering the fact that no matter what\r\nthe direction of the wind, storms almost universally move from the\r\nwest toward the east. When the British captured Washington they also\r\nraided Monticello, Jefferson’s home in Virginia, and they destroyed\r\nhis barometer. It has been said that he was as much distressed over\r\nthe loss of his special instrument of science as he was over the\r\nburning of the National Capitol.\r\n\r\nIn “Descriptive Meteorology” (Appleton), the writer expressed doubt\r\nthat there had been important changes in climate within the period\r\nof authentic history, but recent researches cause him to change his\r\nopinion, for the evidence now seems almost conclusive that marked\r\nchanges have occurred. The powerful kingdoms of Sumeria, Babylonia,\r\nAssyria, and Persia, each ruling many centuries and dominating all\r\nor a large part of the vast region from the Persian Gulf to the\r\nCaspian Sea and westward to the Mediterranean and Egypt, covering in\r\ntheir various reigns some four thousand years before Christ, could\r\nhardly have built their many great cities, supported their numerous\r\nmillions of population, and developed the trade and commerce that\r\nwas theirs with the climatic conditions as they exist to-day. As\r\nlate as the opening of the Christian Era, Palmyra, in Syria, had a\r\npopulation of from one hundred and fifty thousand to two hundred\r\nthousand people, was opulent and adorned with a comparatively high\r\ncivilization. To-day we see the wreckage of its vast aqueduct and\r\nirrigating systems, which are unable to gather enough water to wet\r\ntheir well-constructed walls, and a few hundred people eke out a\r\nmiserable existence where once was a metropolis teeming with life\r\nunder luxurious conditions. The same picture is shown in more or less\r\nrelief throughout the greater part of the region that once maintained\r\nthe greatest empires of antiquity. But we must not assume that such\r\ndry and nearly barren conditions are to continue forever; rather are\r\nwe to imagine that within a cycle of a few thousand years this region\r\nmay have a rebirth of abundant vegetation and again throb with the\r\npulsations of abounding life.\r\n\r\nThe record inscribed by the waters on the abandoned and the\r\nsubmerged shores of inland lakes and seas in the Rocky Mountains,\r\nand on the shores of the Caspian Sea and other waters, is easy to\r\nread. It shows several great oscillations of climate in the United\r\nStates and the most civilized portions of the world since the birth\r\nof Christ. For some time before and for several centuries after the\r\nbeginning of our era there was a wet period. The Caspian Sea stood\r\nsome one hundred feet higher than now and an abandoned beach and a\r\nclearly marked shore line show that Lake Owens, in California, on\r\nthe east side of the Sierras, existed at a level nearly two hundred\r\nfeet higher than now. There was an abundance of water to irrigate the\r\nHoly Land, and although the center of dominating human power had long\r\nsince passed in succession Babylon, Assyria, Persia, Greece, Macedon,\r\nand was working its way towards the Atlantic, the Mesopotamian Valley\r\nwas abundantly fruitful.\r\n\r\nThen, for six or seven hundred years, with short-period variations\r\nof from thirty to fifty years, the world inhabited by civilized man\r\nand large areas in the temperate zone not yet civilized, grew drier.\r\nThe Caspian Sea fell to a lower level than it now maintains, for\r\nthe ends of great walls, constructed to keep out barbarians, and\r\nother evidences of the handiwork of man, are now many feet below\r\nthe surface of the water. This is the driest time known to history.\r\nEllsworth Huntington of Yale, acting under the auspices of the\r\nCarnegie Foundation at Washington, made an examination of many of the\r\nstumps of the big trees of California, ranging in age from one to\r\nfour thousand years. The thickness of each ring of annual growth is a\r\nlegible record of the wetness or the dryness of the year. One would\r\nhardly think of these towering giants of the floral kingdom as being\r\nboth thermometers and rain gauges, accurately measuring and recording\r\nthe dry-hot and the wet-cold periods for thousands of years, and now\r\nat the end of their majestic careers revealing the hidden secrets\r\nof past ages. Huntington and Cushing, in “Principles of Human\r\nGeography”, say:\r\n\r\n  “The rings dating from the time of Christ are thick and indicate\r\n  that at that time, when Palmyra had an abundant supply of\r\n  water, when Owens Lake overflowed and there was high water in\r\n  the Caspian Sea, the big trees also had plenty of water and\r\n  grew rapidly. Six or seven hundred years later, when Palmyra\r\n  was abandoned and when the Caspian Sea stood fifteen or twenty\r\n  feet lower than at present, the trees formed only narrow rings,\r\n  because the climate was dry. The way in which the growth of\r\n  the trees has varied is shown in Figure 30. The high part of\r\n  the curve indicates abundant rainfall. The black shading at the\r\n  bottom indicates periods of comparative aridity.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—Changes in Climate in California during the\r\nChristian Era. Black shading indicates Drought.]\r\n\r\nSince the extensive system of observations by the Weather Bureau was\r\ninaugurated, some fifty years ago, it has been revealed to us that\r\nfrequently the Ohio Valley would suffer a deficit in rainfall that\r\nwould persist for periods as great as five or six years, while New\r\nEngland and the South Atlantic States, or other large areas of the\r\ncountry, had an excess. This is an illustration that excesses in\r\none part of the country were balanced by shortages in other parts\r\nthat occurred at the same time. But the long-period oscillations in\r\nclimate that are measured in hundreds of years instead of tens—these\r\nchanges seemed to have occurred simultaneously in the middle\r\nlatitudes of Europe and America. These changes were simultaneous in\r\nan east and west direction. Now we have evidence of such long-period\r\nchanges in a north and south direction which were simultaneous, but\r\nof an _opposite character_, indicating that during the Christian Era\r\nthe eastward track of storms has oscillated northward and southward.\r\nThis would account for the occurrence of dry and of wet periods\r\nsimultaneously throughout the vast stretch of territory between\r\nsouthern California and the Caspian Sea. In Guatemala, Yucatan, and\r\nother Central American countries there are ruins of cities and the\r\nevidence of an agriculture and a civilization that could not have\r\nbeen established with the torrential rains and jungle growths that\r\nnow prevail in those regions. During the centuries when the big\r\ntrees of California were receiving a large rainfall and making a\r\nthick annual growth, especially about the beginning of the Christian\r\nEra, because of a northward shifting of the climatic zone, the\r\nprecipitation in Yucatan and Guatemala had so diminished as to leave\r\nonly the amount of rainfall that could be economically employed in\r\nagriculture and in the rearing of great cities; and then, with a\r\nsouthward migration of the rain belt, these cities were suffocated\r\nwith excessive precipitation, agriculture rendered impossible, and\r\ntheir temples and palaces buried beneath the gloom of a tropical\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nIf we are to reason from the records of the past it seems highly\r\nprobable that at least the middle latitudes of the Northern\r\nHemisphere are slowly passing out of a dry period that has prevailed\r\nfor the past two hundred years or more. For several hundred years\r\nall the great glaciers have receded, but we should not expect such\r\nrecession to continue indefinitely. Geology furnishes abundant\r\nevidence that great changes took place in the climate of the earth\r\nduring the prehistoric ages; that there were several glacial periods,\r\nthe last occurring during pleistocene times, somewhere between twenty\r\nand fifty thousand years ago, and that there were intervals between\r\nthe culminations of the Ice Ages of probably fifty thousand to one\r\nhundred thousand years. Between these long winters, that have meant\r\ndeath and desolation to much of what are now the most civilized\r\nportions of the earth, there have been warm periods of thousands of\r\nyears’ duration.\r\n\r\nFossil remains show that regions far north, now covered with\r\nperpetual ice, once supported a luxuriant flora and fauna, and many\r\nregions in the temperate and equatorial zones that are now deserts\r\nwere once overgrown with forests and teeming with animal life. The\r\nfundamental thing of the cosmos is change—birth, growth, maturity;\r\nthen decline, senility, death, decay, disintegration; and always\r\na renaissance, or new birth. Energy and life seem to be eternal,\r\nbut ever undergoing change. The Great Ice Cap may again cover New\r\nEngland, the region of the Great Lakes, and flow southward to the\r\nOhio River, but the change will be so gradual, if it does come, that\r\nthere will be no great cities to be ground beneath the feet of the\r\nboreal monster; cold that will precede the ice cap will destroy them\r\nand they will be buried beneath the dust of accumulating ages before\r\ntheir icy tombstone is erected. Then the healthful and invigorating\r\nclimate of the north part of our country will be transferred to the\r\nregion of the Gulf of Mexico. Civilization will and must migrate with\r\nthe shifting of the climatic belts. Because these changes cannot\r\npossibly concern us personally, we have almost neglected the study\r\nof the great forces that silently yet most persistently are at work\r\naltering the conditions under which future man must live and work out\r\nthe destiny of coming generations.\r\n\r\n=Effects of Forests on Climate and Floods.= Next to the fallacious\r\nbelief in a change of climate during the life of an individual there\r\nare few if any errors that have gained such wide acceptance as a\r\nbelief that the cutting away of the forests has caused a marked\r\nchange in climate and especially in the frequency and intensity of\r\nfloods and droughts. The writer shared in the mistake with regard to\r\nthe influence of the forests in restraining run-off and augmenting\r\nfloods, until compelled by an order of the Congress of the United\r\nStates to prepare a report on the floods of the nation that had\r\noccurred during the time of the gradual reduction of the forest\r\nareas. Dividing into two equal periods the forty years for which\r\nthe Weather Bureau has comprehensive records of the rainfall upon\r\nthe catchment basins of the Tennessee, the Cumberland, and the Ohio\r\nrivers, and for which it has records of the height of the rivers,\r\ncontrary to his belief, he found that the high waters were no higher\r\nwith a given rainfall, the floods of no longer duration, nor the\r\nlow waters of summer lower, during the last half of the period than\r\nduring the first half.\r\n\r\nIt is now pretty generally conceded by hydraulic engineers that the\r\nbroken, permeable soil of the husbandman, frequently stirred by\r\ncultivation a part of the year and filled with countless billions\r\nof the tiny water-absorbing rootlets of the grasses and the cereal\r\ncrops during the remainder of the annual period, is equally as good\r\na conserver of the rainfall as the forests themselves, even if it is\r\nnot better.\r\n\r\nSome years ago the writer was delivering a series of Chautauqua\r\nlectures. He arrived at Devil’s Lake, North Dakota, and found that\r\nthe Chautauqua amphitheater was on the banks of Devil’s Lake, once\r\nbordering the town, but now receded to a distance of five miles and\r\nconfined to a narrow valley. In driving from the city to the lecture\r\nhall he remarked to his escort that they seemed to be traveling along\r\nthe bottom of an ancient lake. His companion said, “Yes, a lake, but\r\nnot an ancient one. Fifty years ago I used to dive off a springboard\r\nright there in front of the railroad station.” In the course of his\r\nlecture the writer referred to this incident and told them that,\r\ncontrary to their belief, their climate had not changed, that fifty\r\nyears ago they sold their old lake to some gentlemen in Chicago and\r\nthat they had been selling it over again every year since; that the\r\nformer compact surface of the virgin prairie resisted the penetration\r\nof the rainfall, or at least only slowly absorbed it, and allowed it\r\nto collect in the depression adjacent to the city; but now, in the\r\nbroken, permeable soil of the farmer it was taken up by millions of\r\ntiny rootlets and the hand of the Great Alchemist had transformed\r\ntheir lake into wheat, the sale of which was responsible for the\r\npresence of the speaker on the platform of a largely-attended\r\nChautauqua. The lake had gone never to return unless the region were\r\nagain to become the haunt of the buffalo and the prairie dog instead\r\nof civilized man. The rainfall was the same, but it was now being\r\nutilized for the benefit of mankind.\r\n\r\nIn this problem of rainfall, floods, and the forests, most persons\r\nassume that when the forest is cut the land is at once denuded of\r\nvegetation. On the other hand a second growth will effectually shade\r\nthe soil within a few months or a few weeks after the large trees\r\nare removed, and if the land is cleared and rendered fit for the\r\nplow, growing crops take the place of the forest-covering the greater\r\nportion of the time.\r\n\r\nThere is an abundance of reasons for the protection of our\r\ndiminishing forests and for the creation of new forest areas without\r\nassigning to the forests functions that they do not exercise. The\r\ncovering of an area by a great city, a village, a forest, a barn, or\r\na tent modifies the climate of the particular area covered so long as\r\nthe covering remains, but there is no appreciable climatic effect a\r\nfew feet above the surface of the earth between a forest and a field\r\nof grain. The climate of a region like the American continent is\r\ncontrolled fundamentally by the great oceans that wash its shores,\r\nby the trend of its mountain systems and their height, and by the\r\ndirection of its prevailing winds. The vast vaporous atmosphere\r\nthat flows inland from the Atlantic Ocean to the foothills of the\r\nRocky Mountains, deluging our cereal plains with its life-giving\r\nprecipitation will continue its pluvial generosity without any heed\r\nwhatever to the puny scratchings of man upon the surface of Mother\r\nEarth. Nothing that man can do will intensify drought conditions\r\non this continent or augment the volume of floods. It is time that\r\nwe return to sanity in considering this matter instead of being\r\nfrightened by the dire forebodings of well-meaning but purely\r\nvisionary enthusiasts, no matter how noble their aspirations may be\r\nor how self-sacrificingly they have consecrated themselves to the\r\nredemption of humanity.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that forests restrict the flow of moderate falls of\r\nrain, but they do not restrain the flow of flood waters, because,\r\nsurprising as it may seem to one who has not tested the matter,\r\nfloods do not occur until after all surfaces, open fields and forests\r\nalike, have become saturated, and then the run-off of the two\r\nsurfaces is equal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nCLIMATES FOR HEALTH AND PLEASURE\r\n\r\n  ONE’S LIFE WOULD BE PROLONGED IF, LIKE THE BIRDS, ONE COULD\r\n  MIGRATE ANNUALLY WITH THE TEMPERATURE—CHRISTMAS IN MANY\r\n  CLIMES—THE HOTTEST AND COLDEST PLACES IN THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has gone before it is apparent that the regions of the\r\nearth where man is at his best estate, so far as climate can\r\ndetermine his environment, may be broadly defined in this country\r\nas southern New England, southern and central New York, the Middle\r\nAtlantic States, the Ohio Valley, the southern Lake Region and\r\nwestward to the middle of Kansas and Nebraska; in Europe it includes\r\nthe British Isles, France, Switzerland, extreme northern Italy,\r\nAustria, Germany, Belgium, Holland, and the extreme southern parts\r\nof Norway and Sweden. But in none of these regions is the climate\r\nequally good during all seasons. In fact there are two short seasons\r\nin each year when it is debilitating.\r\n\r\nThe great majority of the people, like galley slaves chained to\r\ntheir oars, must remain in the same place throughout the year, others\r\nmay have a vacation of several weeks, and still others are free to\r\nchange their location as often as fancy calls them. The latter might\r\nwell learn from the birds, and by migrating with the temperature,\r\ngoing far north in summer and far south in winter, maintain\r\nthemselves throughout the entire year in the most perfect atmospheric\r\nconditions for health, happiness, and long life. Many a man of fifty,\r\nhaving accumulated enough to modestly supply his wants, could add ten\r\nto thirty years to his life, or might even double the period of his\r\nexistence, by ceasing to strive after riches, and by giving himself\r\nup to a healthful movement about this beautiful world. His principal\r\ncompanions should be good books,—the study of which will enlarge his\r\nmental horizon and increase his capacity to see, comprehend, and\r\nenjoy, and fit him to speak, act, and think in ways that will inure\r\nto the public good. If he has not had the benefits of a college\r\neducation, now is the golden opportunity to read, and have pleasure\r\nin the reading, popular books on Geology, Botany, Biology, Astronomy,\r\nand Physics, and to become familiar with the history of his own\r\ncountry and of the world. It need not be a period of idleness but one\r\nof beautiful growth and of appreciation of the wonders of creation.\r\nAnd thus will his spirit be lifted up and fitted for a higher realm\r\nof existence in the world to come.\r\n\r\nTo those who must remain at home during heat spells, the advice is\r\ngiven to close not only the shutters but the windows on the east side\r\nof the house during the forenoon and do the same on the west side in\r\nthe afternoon. The best night’s sleep will be gained in a room facing\r\nnorth on any floor that is not next the roof; this room will be\r\ncooler if it is protected by another room on its east and one on its\r\nwest side.\r\n\r\n=Long Life in the Open Air and the Sunshine.= It is difficult to\r\ndecide which most conduces to health and longevity: cheerfulness\r\nof mind and kindness of thought, or life in the open air and in\r\nthe blessed sunshine. If one can enjoy both of these beneficent\r\nconditions they should live as long as they desire to remain on\r\nearth. _Most people live as long as they deserve to live._ It has\r\nfacetiously been said that old age is a bad habit. The writer is\r\ndisposed to agree with the humorist. Certain it is that few persons\r\nwho believe in the limitation of life to three score and ten ever\r\nlive beyond that period, while one should be possessed of a sound\r\nbody and a superior mind at that age, with just anticipations of a\r\nthird of a century of usefulness and happiness yet to come. As a man\r\nthinketh, so is he. We are just beginning to comprehend something\r\nof the wonderful power with which the Creator has invested us in\r\nthe development and the care of our bodies. Anger, hatred, malice,\r\njealousy, selfishness, fear, and worry create poisons that _may_\r\nbring on disease and death, but they _certainly_ create a morbidity\r\nin the body that shortens life.\r\n\r\nSunshine destroys molds, bacteria, and other enemies of the human\r\nrace that lurk in the darkness. It strikes dead the tubercle\r\nbacillus, which is such a scourge to mankind. Its remedial power\r\ncomes largely from invisible light—the ultra-violet and the supra-red\r\nrays. You are blind to these rays but your skin and blood are not;\r\nthey need the sunshine to give them vitality—not quack medicines\r\nor medical tonics for which, through the venal partnership of the\r\nPress, millions of the afflicted are induced not only to part with\r\nthe money so much needed by their families and themselves, but\r\nto aggravate their sufferings. The sunshine of a high region is\r\nbeneficial to those ill with coughs, colds, bronchitis, tuberculosis,\r\nanæmia, or other wasting diseases, because the upper altitudes are\r\nrich in many rays that are beneficial, some of which are absorbed\r\nby the higher air and do not penetrate to the earth, or only reach\r\nthe earth in minute quantities. There on the mountain the sun’s rays\r\nare unpolluted by the dust and the bacteria of lower levels and\r\nthe cities. But one does not need extreme altitudes. Two to three\r\nthousand feet may be sufficient.\r\n\r\n=Mountain and Sea Air and the Injury from Over-bathing.= The seashore\r\nis properly a great national playground during the heat of summer.\r\nEvaporated spray leaves a trace of salt in the air which, with the\r\nsalt of the ocean, seems to be beneficial to many. Likewise there is\r\nno condition of life that is not benefited by the pure air of the\r\nwooded mountains. Those of moderate vigor may build up and maintain\r\nhigh vitality by continuous bathing in the cool, pure waters of\r\nmountain lakes and streams, but to many daily swimming in either\r\nfresh or salt water, except that it be for a mere dip and right out\r\nagain, that is so cold as to be painful to the delicate sensations\r\nof the skin, is extremely debilitating to all bodily functions. Be\r\nmoderate.\r\n\r\n=How to Find the Climate You Seek.= At sea level in the tropics heat\r\nand moisture combine to produce great physical discomfort. But even\r\nunder the equator it is possible to escape the tropical heat of low\r\nlevels by ascending four to six thousand feet, as can be done in some\r\nplaces in Porto Rico and Cuba. Most of the capitals of South American\r\ncountries are located at altitudes of five to ten thousand feet; and\r\nBrazil is planning to abandon her capital at sea level and move the\r\nadministrative machinery of government from the splendid city of Rio\r\nde Janeiro to a mountain location in the interior.\r\n\r\nAny region of the Alleghany system of mountains above a thousand\r\nfeet elevation possesses climatic conditions of therapeutic value.\r\nIllustration of this fact is seen in the success of the noted\r\nsanitaria in the Adirondacks, and in the mountain regions of North\r\nCarolina and Virginia, and in the northern part of New England.\r\nThese sections are especially frequented by persons suffering from\r\npulmonary diseases, or from nervous exhaustion, many of whom find not\r\nonly relief but cure. Cool and healthful conditions of temperature\r\nmay be found during the summer along the ridges and on the peaks of\r\nthe entire mountain system that extends from North Carolina northward\r\nthrough Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, and New England. The\r\nadvice of one’s physician should be sought, if one is ailing, before\r\ndetermining between the seashore and the mountains, but in general\r\nthose suffering from diseases of the respiratory organs are better\r\nlocated in the high levels, remote from the humid air of the ocean.\r\n\r\nIn winter Bermuda, Florida, Porto Rico, Cuba, the southern part of\r\nthe Gulf States, much of Southern California, and Hawaii have balmy\r\nclimates that permit of outdoor life without temperatures too high to\r\nbe comfortable. Hawaii and Bermuda have mild climates not only during\r\nwinter but throughout the entire year. The Riviera on the Gulf of\r\nGenoa and the beautiful Lake region of Italy enjoy the balmy air of\r\nthe Mediterranean and are protected from the cold winter winds by the\r\nAlps.\r\n\r\nFrom October to May that portion of the Rocky Mountain plateau that\r\nincludes Arizona, New Mexico, and the northern interior of Old Mexico\r\nhas one of the finest climates in the world for those afflicted with\r\npulmonary diseases, as the sunshine is abundant and the day and night\r\ntemperatures such as to permit an almost continuous out-of-doors\r\nexistence. But the heat and the extreme dryness of the air in June,\r\nJuly, August, and the first half of September is irritating to the\r\nnerves and debilitating in general. Fortunately, when the conditions\r\nare not favorable in the extreme southwest part of the country, they\r\nare at their best in the mountains of the Middle Atlantic States and\r\nNew England, which offer to the pleasure or the health seeker a cool,\r\npure air unsurpassed by any other region of the earth.\r\n\r\nFor an all-the-year climate for the health seeker, it only can\r\nbe said that the ideal conditions do not continue at any place\r\nthroughout the entire year. Possibly it is well that it is so, as a\r\nchange may be beneficial for no reason except that it is a change.\r\nThere is one great caution ever to be borne in mind, and that is that\r\nthe health seeker must not continue or repeat the same unhygienic\r\nlife in his new climate that brought on the disease in the old.\r\n\r\n=Climate of Cuba.= The climate of one tropical country may differ\r\nmaterially from that of another in the same latitude as a result\r\nof difference in altitude, proximity to large bodies of water, and\r\nposition with respect to the prevailing winds. Cuba being in the\r\nregion of the northeast trade winds, more rain falls on the north\r\nside of its mountains than on the south side. The temperature of the\r\nsoutheast coast is higher than it is on the northern and western\r\ncoasts, and the range of temperature everywhere between night and day\r\nis small, rarely ten degrees and usually much less. It therefore has\r\na warm, humid, and monotonous climate, except in the high levels of\r\nits mountains. The winter tourist will find the conditions of the\r\ngreater part of the island somewhat similar to those in the region\r\nof Miami, Florida, but warmer. Havana is not so hot as Santiago. The\r\nhighest temperature ever recorded at Havana is 101° and the lowest\r\n50°. A fairly pleasant temperature always can be found within a short\r\nride to the mountains. As in most tropical countries, Cuba has a dry\r\nand a wet season. The rainy season is May to October. In the early\r\npart of September, 1900, over thirty-six inches of rain fell within\r\nthirty-six hours at Santiago. As a rule the precipitation is in the\r\nshape of heavy showers, the clouds clearing as soon as the rain\r\nceases; the showers usually occur in the afternoon. Cuba, in common\r\nwith all the islands of the West Indies, occasionally is visited\r\nby destructive hurricanes; these storms mainly are confined to the\r\nperiod August to October. Frequent terrific thunderstorms occur in\r\nsummer.\r\n\r\n=Climate of Porto Rico.= Its mountainous character gives it a marked\r\ndiversity of climate, torrential rains falling on the windward side\r\nof its mountains, while the leeward sides are comparatively dry. The\r\nhighest temperature in San Juan since 1876 is 101° and the lowest\r\n57°. In this city a cool breeze, known as the “briza”, adds to the\r\ncomfort of the late afternoon and evening. The wet season begins\r\na month earlier than in Cuba and lasts a month longer. San Juan is\r\nprobably the most healthful city in the West Indies, but those reared\r\nin northern climates invariably suffer from its enervating influence\r\nafter several years of continuous residence. Water is abundant, there\r\nbeing some seventy rivers and over a thousand small streams. The\r\nmountains are clothed in vegetation to their tops, and frost of a\r\nkilling nature is practically unknown in the island.\r\n\r\n=Climate of the Hawaiian Islands.= Much has been written about the\r\ncharm of the Hawaiian Islands, their mountains, volcanoes, tropical\r\nverdure, and delightful climate. It is indeed a garden spot, and\r\nits soil and climate make it so. Nowhere in the islands does the\r\ntemperature reach 90° at any time of the year, while at Honolulu,\r\nthe largest city and the capital, a temperature lower than 60° is\r\nrarely experienced. Of course, as one ascends the high mountains for\r\nwhich the group is noted, much lower temperatures are encountered,\r\nwhile snow is not infrequent near the tops. July and August are the\r\nwarmest months and January the coldest. The climate is soothing and\r\ndreamy and doubtless would prolong the life of many who are aged\r\nand slowly passing to their end, and that of others of low vitality\r\nbut no organic disease. Most of the rain falls November to May, but\r\nsome falls in every month of the year. At Honolulu the amount is\r\nabout that which falls in Wisconsin, but at a station in the Kohala\r\nMountains one hundred and fifty-four inches have been measured as the\r\nrainfall for seven months, and forty-two inches for one month, the\r\nlatter being a larger amount than the annual rainfall for the State\r\nof Iowa.\r\n\r\n=Climate of the Philippines.= The highest temperature so far recorded\r\nat Manila is 100° and the lowest 60°. It is therefore warmer than\r\neither Havana or Porto Rico. The hottest months are April, May, and\r\nJune, but the cool months are but a trifle cooler than the warm\r\nmonths, the annual range of temperature being but three degrees. The\r\nhumidity is high at all seasons, and therefore the heat is oppressive\r\nand debilitating. The greater part of the rainfall of Manila is from\r\nJune to October. Some relief may be gained from the low-level heat\r\nby retreat to the mountains of some of the islands. It will require\r\nseveral generations before the white man can become acclimated to\r\nthis region. The islands lie between latitude 6° and 18° North. White\r\nchildren born of American parents and raised there never will have\r\nthe energy or ambition of their progenitors. If it were not for the\r\ninvigorating air of the mountain resort at Baquio, many American\r\nofficials could not continue a residence in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n=Climate of Bermuda in Comparison with the Popular Winter Resorts\r\nof Florida and California.= It is a mistake to represent the\r\nclimate of Bermuda as one of balmy sunshine during winter months.\r\nIt has some glorious days, but a large proportion are cloudy,\r\nrainy, cool, and windy, and too cold for comfortable or healthful\r\nbathing from the middle of December to the first of May. And yet,\r\nits climate is healthful as a whole for nine months of the year and\r\nmore stimulating than is that of Florida in winter. If one wishes\r\nsunshine and sea bathing in midwinter, it is better to go to Palm\r\nBeach, St. Petersburg, or Miami, Florida; but if one desires to\r\nhave a moderately cool climate with a temperature of but little\r\nvariation between midday and midnight, and occasionally a day with\r\nsufficient warmth and sunshine to justify a dip in the ocean or in\r\nthe many land-locked bays with which the islands abound, one well\r\nmay come to Bermuda. Such winter clothing as one naturally would\r\nwear in Philadelphia or Washington is what one will need in order\r\nto be comfortable. Bermuda is no place for Palm Beach suits, outing\r\nshirts, and Panama hats in winter. Many tourists are mislead by\r\nthe advertisements of steamship lines and bring clothing which is\r\nsuitable only for early fall and late spring.\r\n\r\nFrom the first of November to the middle of May the author occupied\r\na room on the ground floor, facing the waters of Hamilton Harbor,\r\nand only fifty feet from the shore line. Here the diurnal range\r\nof temperature is much less than at Prospect Hill, where the\r\nGovernment’s observations are made. From the middle of December to\r\nthe middle of March, a thermometer in this room sluggishly ranged\r\nfrom 60° at night to 64° during the day, and days when the wind\r\nwas high and rain falling—as occurs about one third of the time in\r\nwinter—the thermometer would not vary a degree from 60° during the\r\nentire twenty-four hours. During April the range each day was from\r\n68° at night to 70° at midday, and during November and May from 70°\r\nto 76°.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the best winter climate for health and for pleasure\r\nis so important that comparative data are here given of the most\r\npopular places that are easy of access to the people of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nBermuda has a wind velocity much greater than that of any of the\r\nresorts named in the tables, and its relative humidity is about that\r\nof Florida.\r\n\r\nThe charm of Bermuda is that the flowers bloom, vegetables grow, and\r\nthe trees remain green the year round. Even though frequent short\r\nshowers may fall each twenty-four hours more than half of the days\r\nduring winter, the soil is so porous that there is little or no mud,\r\nand life is largely one of the open air, with a winter temperature\r\nthat conduces to activity; in fact, the temperature is such that one\r\nrequires heavy clothing all the time if one is to sit inactive in the\r\nopen. There is neither frost, fog, nor malaria, nor snakes.\r\n\r\nBermuda lies 666 miles south of New York City and about 700 miles\r\ndue east from Charleston, S. C., and 293 miles from the southern\r\nedge of the Gulf Stream, which, if the truth must be told, exercises\r\nno such influence on the climate of Bermuda as highly colored\r\nadvertising circulars would have one believe. It is the great ocean,\r\nupon whose surface the islands make the most infinitesimal dot, that\r\ncontrols the climate of the Bermudas. The Gulf Stream, wonderful\r\nphenomenon that it is, is a sort of bug-a-boo to some who never\r\nhave intelligently studied ocean meteorology. Travelers tell of the\r\nsuperheated atmosphere they encountered on crossing the Stream, and\r\neducators who should know better teach that the entire climate of\r\nEurope is markedly influenced by it. The fact is that there is no\r\ndistortion whatever of the isothermal lines as they enter and leave\r\nthe Gulf stream in any region north of Bermuda. (See Chart 14.) The\r\nclimate of Bermuda and of Europe is controlled largely by the great\r\nAtlantic Ocean, not by this small river of warm water, which broadens\r\nout and loses its identity long before the coast of Europe is\r\nreached, and whose influence is soon dissipated in the vast expanse\r\nof ocean air. The ocean has a great circulating system, northward\r\non the western and southward on its eastern side. This circulation\r\npushes the isothermal lines northward on one side and southward on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nThe islands of Bermuda rise some 15,000 feet from the floor of the\r\nocean, and project above the water to heights varying from 50 to\r\n260 feet above sea level. Like jewels nestling upon the bosom of a\r\nsub-tropical ocean these islands, from one half to three miles wide,\r\nare strung along so close that one almost can hop over from one to\r\nthe other. They lie in the form of a fish-hook; from the hole where\r\nthe line of the fisherman would be tied to the point of the hook is\r\nabout twenty-six miles. The topography is irregular and picturesque.\r\nOn land there are caves and grottoes and subterranean lakes. January\r\nto May rose borders are abloom. In April the oleander is showing\r\npink and crimson along every roadside, and the hedges hold these\r\nbeautiful flowers for months; at Easter time lilies carpet the ground\r\nand perfume the air. Here morning glories have many forms and colors,\r\nwhich, with pendent bells, climb wide-spreading cedar trees, and wild\r\npassion flowers cover rocky cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe sea is so transparent that many feet below the surface the\r\neye may follow the movements of marine life housed about by coral\r\nformations of strange devices. The colors of the sea are as\r\nchangeable as the opal. Over shallow bottoms the colors are delicate\r\nshades of light green, over the shoals brownish hues, and beyond the\r\ndangerous reefs, which have sent many a sailor to his long home, and\r\nbehind which numerous pirates of old have taken refuge, the waters\r\nvary from the light blue of the sapphire to deep green. The prismatic\r\ncolors are forever laughing and dancing to the eye of the beholder.\r\nThe shadow of a cloud, a ripple of the surface, a different angle\r\nto the fall of sunshine as the day advances, deepen or brighten the\r\ntints through a wide range of color.\r\n\r\nThrough the glass bottom of a boat one may look into the gardens.\r\nRising from the bottom and waving gracefully with the movements of\r\nthe waters, like tree ferns moved by gentle zephyrs, are purple sea\r\nfans and tall black rods. Beautifully colored fishes dart about, or\r\nlazily bask in the sun that illumines their coral grottoes; weeds of\r\nmany colors; green and scarlet sponges; vegetable growths delicate in\r\nformation and brilliant anemones cling to ledges of rock that here\r\nand there are tinted with pink.\r\n\r\nRival champions of the east and the west coasts of Florida may\r\nfortify themselves by a study of the tables. It may be noted that\r\nMiami and Tampa have the same midday temperature, but that Tampa\r\nhas a greater range, the night temperature on the average falling\r\nfive degrees lower than Miami; also that Tampa, which can be\r\ntaken as typical of St. Petersburg, has but twenty-one rainy days\r\non an average from December to March inclusive, while Miami has\r\nthirty-four. Bermuda has sixty-five days with rain during the period,\r\nwith much wind.

To this query one is\r\n  tempted to retort: What are they _not_ good for? Let us set down\r\n  a few typical cases in which such data are desired.\r\n\r\n  “A merchant plans to undertake the sale of rubber coats\r\n  in foreign markets. Hence he wishes to know all about the\r\n  distribution of rainfall, both geographically and as to season.\r\n  Which are the rainy regions of the globe? When do the heaviest\r\n  occur in each of these regions? Where do the prevailing\r\n  temperatures indicate the need of heavy coats, and where light?\r\n\r\n  “An invalid contemplates visiting a certain health resort. What\r\n  mean temperatures occur there at the season of the proposed\r\n  visit? What ranges of temperature between day and night? How much\r\n  does the temperature vary from day to day? How much sunshine may\r\n  be expected? Is the atmosphere moist or dry? What of the winds?\r\n  Such are some of the questions he is likely to ask.\r\n\r\n  “A horticulturist proposes to introduce a foreign plant in this\r\n  country. Where will he find the most favorable climate for it? In\r\n  order to settle this question he first tries to secure certain\r\n  information about the climate of the plant’s original habitat—the\r\n  march of temperature through the season of growth, average\r\n  dates of first and last frost, normal fluctuations of rainfall,\r\n  humidity, sunshine, etc. If the desired information is obtained,\r\n  the next step is to ascertain where (if anywhere) similar\r\n  climatic conditions prevail in the United States, and this is\r\n  generally an easy task.\r\n\r\n  “An engineer is planning a sewer system. He needs data of\r\n  excessive rainfall for the locality under consideration, so that\r\n  he may estimate the maximum amount of storm-water the sewers will\r\n  ever need to dispose of in a given time. Their capacity should\r\n  not exceed this amount beyond a reasonable margin of safety:\r\n  otherwise cost of construction would be unnecessarily great.\r\n\r\n  “This list of examples might be extended almost indefinitely.\r\n  It will suffice, however, to show how wide a range of climatic\r\n  information is required to meet all possible demands. The\r\n  different branches of industry are concerned with different sets\r\n  of climatic data. One set helps determine the best location\r\n  for a railroad: another the kind of goods that will be shipped\r\n  over it and the way in which they will need to be packed and\r\n  cared for during shipment. The climatic conditions that must be\r\n  considered in planning a military campaign are quite unlike those\r\n  that engage the attention of a hydrological engineer in laying\r\n  out a system of irrigation. Climatic statistics of interest to\r\n  aviators are not identical with those that bear upon the problems\r\n  of ecology or forestry or sanitation. In short, climate means\r\n  different things to different people.”\r\n\r\n=Christmas in Many Climes.= A general idea of the diversification of\r\nclimate may be gathered from a description of the weather of some\r\nparticular day of the year as it exists in many different parts of\r\nthe world. One is too prone to assume that the weather one has on a\r\ngiven day prevails everywhere. For the moment one does not consider\r\nthe effect of distance from the equator, proximity to large bodies\r\nof water, and elevation above sea level and above the surrounding\r\nregion. When a holiday or any day of special interest occurs,\r\nwhile the weather cannot make the occasion a success, it can quite\r\neffectively destroy all pleasure in the event. When we approach the\r\nday of all days in the year when two fifths of the people of the\r\nworld celebrate the natal day of Christ, interest in the weather\r\nincreases. The little ones of our clime pray that a mantle of snow\r\nmay cover the ground, so that dear old Santa Claus may come with his\r\nreindeer and sleigh. The boys and girls long for the snow-covered\r\nhillsides and the glassy ponds; and even our good old grandmother\r\nsmiles in anticipation of such a Christmas Day as gladdened her heart\r\nwhen she was a wee tot.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to know under what kind of skies the people of\r\nother lands celebrate this international holiday. In the Northern\r\nHemisphere places near the same latitude may have weather conditions\r\ngreatly at variance the one from the other, because of conditions\r\npreviously explained. It is our winter now; not because the sun is\r\nfarthest from us, for in five days the earth will reach the time\r\nof perihelion in its course around the sun, and be nearer to the\r\ncentral luminary than at any other time of the year, but because the\r\ninclination of the earth’s axis causes us to receive the rays of the\r\nsun at a lower angle than during any other season and its intensity\r\nis reduced. The conditions are reversed to the people of the Southern\r\nHemisphere; they now receive the most direct rays of the sun and have\r\ntheir summer, which is intensified by the nearness of the earth to\r\nthe sun.\r\n\r\nThe event that gave origin to our Christmas holiday occurred nearly\r\ntwo thousand years ago in Bethlehem of Judea; and it may be a new\r\nidea to us to try to think of the weather that prevailed at that\r\ntime and the character of the Christmas Day that land may have this\r\nyear. We know that it was not cold and cloudy on that eventful night\r\nso long ago, for the shepherds were feeding their flocks upon the\r\nhillsides and the Wise Men of the East beheld a star and followed\r\nit. The star shone brightly from the time they left Herod until they\r\nreached the place where the Infant lay. We may therefore judge that\r\nthis part of their journey was made under a clear sky and that the\r\nsame conditions prevailed at Bethlehem. Weather observations made\r\nat Jerusalem, a few miles from Bethlehem, during modern times, show\r\nthat during December there are less than fourteen cloudy days on the\r\naverage. The prevailing winds are from the Mediterranean Sea, only\r\nthirty miles to the west of Bethlehem, and therefore rarely does the\r\ntemperature exceed 65° during the day or fall to freezing at night.\r\nWhile there is evidence that the climate is drier now throughout all\r\nof the Holy Land than at the birth of Christ, it is highly probable\r\nthat when He was born the stars were shining brightly and the hills\r\nwere green and beautiful and the weather smiling its benediction upon\r\nthe Son of God.\r\n\r\nWe now will glance at the weather that experience teaches us will\r\nprobably prevail in some of the principal cities of the world on\r\nChristmas Day, and thus have impressed upon us the fact that on\r\nany day of the year humanity lives under widely differing weather\r\nconditions throughout the world.\r\n\r\nIn our own country we know that Maine is the home of ice, snow, and\r\nchilling blasts, while in California and Florida orange blossoms\r\nperfume the temperate air.\r\n\r\nIn London Christmas is not always bright and comfortable, for on the\r\naverage twenty-one days in December are cloudy and the temperature\r\nranges from a few degrees below freezing at night to about 50° during\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nIn Paris the weather is about the same as in London. It has the same\r\npercentage of cloudiness, and its daily range of temperature is\r\nfrom 32° to 45°, slightly colder than London. The influence of wind\r\ndirection and the relation of water and land areas to the location\r\nof a city are well exemplified in the fact that Paris, farther south\r\nthan London, has a lower winter temperature. In the United States\r\nthe coldest winter winds are from the northwest and they also would\r\nbe so in Western Europe were it not for the fact that they draw from\r\nthe ocean, whose waters are much warmer in winter than the interior\r\nof the continent of Europe. The northeast winds are therefore the\r\ncoldest that come to Paris and London. In the first case they draw\r\nfrom the cold interior, and in the second case the air in passing\r\nto London from the northeast must pass over the North Sea and the\r\nextreme temperature of the cold land is somewhat modified by even\r\nthis comparatively small body of water with the result that the\r\naverage daily maximum temperature of London for December is five\r\ndegrees warmer than its neighbor some two hundred miles farther\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\nBerlin and Vienna have the same degree of cloudiness, but there the\r\nsimilarity ceases. Berlin, only about one hundred miles from the\r\nBaltic Sea on the northeast and about double this distance from the\r\nNorth Sea on the northwest has an average range of but eight degrees\r\nbetween day and night temperatures, while Vienna, deep-set in the\r\ninterior of a great continent, has a daily range of thirty-seven\r\ndegrees, the average temperature swinging from 13° to 50° each day\r\nduring December.\r\n\r\nConstantinople was named after the Roman Emperor who made it\r\nhis capital and who first protected the early Christians from\r\npersecution, then became converted and, in the manner of his time,\r\nforced others to accept the doctrine at the point of the sword. Here\r\nChristianity was first recognized and adopted as a State religion,\r\nbut since the middle of the fifteenth century Constantinople has\r\nbeen the home of the Sultan of Turkey and the principal city of\r\nthose who worship Muhammid as the prophet of God instead of Christ.\r\nThis ancient city, so interwoven in the history of Christianity,\r\nhas a delightful climate at Christmas time, the daily range being\r\nfrom between a little above freezing and 65° or 70°, with clouds\r\nobscuring the sky about one half the time.\r\n\r\nHistorical Rome has about as many clear days as cloudy ones and the\r\ndays are pleasant and the nights simply cool.\r\n\r\nAt Cairo, in the land where Joseph was sold into bondage and where\r\nPharaoh raised him to the highest position in the land next to his\r\nown, no more delightful place can the traveler find at Christmas\r\ntime. Only one day in three is cloudy and the gentle winds are warm\r\nand balmy, with a daily range in temperature of 12°.\r\n\r\nIn Calcutta there is a great amount of sunshine, only one day in five\r\nbeing cloudy, with an average daily minimum temperature of 58° and a\r\nmaximum of 80°.\r\n\r\nBombay is also sunshiny at this time of the year and excessively\r\nhot, with a range each day from 66° to 88°. Here, as at Calcutta,\r\nBrahmanism and Buddhism rule instead of Christianity.\r\n\r\nChina, that enormous empire that believes in the ethical philosophy\r\nof Confucius, whose inhabitants have lived for four thousand years\r\nwith less strife and bloodshed than any other nation, has as great\r\na variety of climate during December in the widely separated parts\r\nof its broad domain as has the United States. On any day of the\r\nChristmas month some parts of this country are bound in icy chains,\r\nwhile other parts are sweltering in a torrid temperature.\r\n\r\nThat wonderful Island—Japan—whose people have made such amazing\r\nstrides in catching up with the most advanced civilization of the\r\nOccident, and who never have accepted Christianity, has a most\r\ndelightful climate during winter, with a large amount of sunshine and\r\nmoderate temperatures.\r\n\r\nThe vast Christian nation so long ruled by the Tzar, and now in\r\nsuch deplorable chaos, has a varied climate during December. From\r\ntemperate conditions in the southern portion of its European\r\npossessions it gradually grows colder as one goes northward until a\r\nregion of great severity is reached. At Petrograd the average night\r\ntemperature is 6° below zero. At Moscow it is colder, the average of\r\nits minimum temperature being 11° below. Two thirds of the time it is\r\ncloudy at these two cities.\r\n\r\nVerkhoyansk, in the central portion of Siberia, is nearly the coldest\r\nplace in the world where observations are regularly taken. There\r\nChristmas Day may be ushered in with a temperature as low as 75°\r\nbelow zero. For days at a time this extreme cold remains, the warmest\r\npart of the day varying but little from the coldest.\r\n\r\nIn many of the cities of the Southern Hemisphere Christmas Day is\r\nlikely to be such as will cause the sojourner to long for some cooler\r\nregion. There it is midsummer, the grass is green and the fruit is on\r\nthe tree. We of the North could hardly realize that it is December.\r\nIn the pampas of the Argentine Republic everything is parched. The\r\nwhite stucco walls and the red tile roofs in the cities reflect the\r\nintense rays of the sun into the shimmering air. In Rio de Janeiro\r\nthe days are almost unbearable, the daily temperature rising to 100°\r\nand over at midday and seldom falling to 60° at night. Bear in mind\r\nthat the greater part of the area of South America lies between the\r\nequator and 30° south latitude. But wherever in these South American\r\ncities one can escape to an elevation of several thousand feet a\r\npleasant temperature may be found.\r\n\r\nAt Santiago, Chili, it is more comfortable than in Brazil, for the\r\nnights are cool, even though the day temperatures rival those of\r\nthe Argentine Republic. But here the cool mountain tops are almost\r\nhanging over the coast cities.\r\n\r\nAt Cape Town, in the extreme south part of Africa, two days out of\r\nthree are clear and the daily range of temperature is from 48° to\r\n83°, making fairly pleasant conditions during the Christmas holidays.\r\n\r\nAt Melbourne, Australia, one half of the days are cloudy, and the\r\ntemperature is moderate, having a range from 54° to 75°.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the climatological features of the world, not only\r\non Christmas but on any other day of the year, are as varied as\r\nthe hopes and wishes of man, and whatever his desires or physical\r\nnecessities may be, a climate may be found under the influence of\r\nwhich he may find pleasure and gain health.\r\n\r\n=The Hottest and the Coldest Places in the World.= It is an innate\r\ncharacteristic of the human race to be interested in the abnormal,\r\nwhether it be in the achievements of men or in the extremes of\r\nnatural phenomena. This is especially true with regard to the\r\nweather. During periods of extremes of heat or cold the natural\r\ninquiry is as to whether there ever has been a period of equal or\r\ngreater severity. Although suffering intensely there always is a\r\ndesire to “beat the record.” It therefore may be of interest briefly\r\nto refer to the hottest and the coldest places in the world.\r\n\r\n=North America.= One of the most torrid places in the United States\r\nis in that remarkable region known as Death Valley. It is located\r\nin Southern California. Its name is supposed to be derived from a\r\nmelancholy tragedy that occurred in 1850, in which every member\r\nof a party of emigrants perished in Death Valley from thirst and\r\nexhaustion, leaving the bones of themselves and their animals to\r\nwhiten in the sun. The valley is the bed of an ancient salt sea\r\nwhich existed when the climate was much wetter than now; its soil\r\nis largely composed of sand, salt, and borax. The borax deposits\r\nare large; at places they form crusts that support the weight of\r\ntravelers. The length of the valley is seventy-five miles, but it\r\nis narrow at the bottom, in places being no more than six miles.\r\nOne of its remarkable features is that its bottom, in many places,\r\nis three hundred feet below the level of the sea, one hundred miles\r\nto the west. It is fed by several small streams and innumerable\r\nwarm springs, the water from which is entirely absorbed by the\r\nporous soil, although water may be found by digging down a few\r\nfeet. The water is unfit for use. It is a desolate and forbidden\r\nregion, inhabited by gnats, toads, lizards, and snakes. However, the\r\nemployees of a company engaged in the business of marketing borax\r\nspend a portion of each year there.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 an observer of the U. S. Weather Bureau remained in Death\r\nValley from May to September, during which time he made daily\r\nobservations of the weather. His experience was a most trying one,\r\ndrawing heavily upon his physical and mental stamina to complete the\r\nperiod of time that had been set for him. For the entire time of\r\none hundred and fifty-four days less than one half an inch of rain\r\nfell. There occurred several days in succession with a temperature of\r\n122°. However, this is not the highest temperature ever recorded in\r\nthe United States. In July, 1887, at Mammoth Tank, in the Colorado\r\nDesert, the temperature reached 128° in the shade, and again, in\r\n1884, 124° was reached at the same place. On July 18, 1891, in Death\r\nValley, the maximum was 120° and the minimum 99°, making an average\r\nfor all hours of 108.6°. The extremely high temperatures reached in\r\nthe Colorado Desert, which embraces a portion of Southern California\r\nand Arizona, do not vary greatly from those of Death Valley; they are\r\nnot exceeded anywhere in Central or North America. Such degrees of\r\nheat, if experienced for two or three weeks in the more humid regions\r\nof the eastern half of the United States, would nearly depopulate the\r\nregion by the havoc of death.\r\n\r\nThe lowest temperatures in the United States occur in extreme\r\nnorthern portions of Minnesota, North Dakota, and Montana, where\r\ntemperatures from 50° to 55° below zero have been recorded. It is\r\ninteresting to note that in this same region the summer temperatures\r\nhave risen to readings of from 105° to 108°. Of course this heat is\r\nquite different in its effects upon life from the heat of the Gulf\r\nor Atlantic coasts. One feels a marked difference between the sun\r\nand the shade temperatures in these semi-arid regions. Sunstroke is\r\ninfrequent and death seldom results from exposure, as it does in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nThe region of severest cold in North America is found about the Great\r\nBear Lake in the British Northwest Territory, where temperatures of\r\n58° below zero have been recorded.\r\n\r\n=South America.= The hottest portion of South America is in the\r\ninterior, with extensive systems of mountain ranges along the coast\r\npreventing the inward flow of the moist rain-bearing winds from the\r\nocean. In a stretch of country extending from Uruguay northward into\r\nthe interior of Brazil, the average of the highest temperature of\r\neach year for a period of several years is 104°, with individual\r\nreadings much higher. Except on the top of the mountains, or well up\r\ntheir sides, no severely cold weather occurs in South America, seven\r\neighths of its territory lying between the equator and latitude 30°\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n=Africa.= In Africa is to be found the hottest region of the world,\r\nthe great Desert of Sahara, upon whose sands beats down the fierce\r\ntropical sun with merciless intensity. Here shade temperatures of\r\n130° are frequently experienced. Only those bred to extreme tropical\r\ndesert heat can long live under such conditions. In a portion of\r\nthe desert lying between Egypt and the Red Sea the temperature has\r\nbeen known not to fall below 113° for a period of ten days, while\r\non several nights the lowest temperature reached was 118°, with a\r\npractically calm air. Africa lies with about one half of its immense\r\narea on each side of the equator, and the greater part of its\r\nterritory inside the Tropical Zone. Except in a few isolated cases on\r\nhigh mountains, temperatures as low as zero never are experienced.\r\n\r\n=Europe.= The warmest portion of Europe is in the region round\r\nand about the Mediterranean Sea. The coldest places in all Europe\r\nare in the western part of Russia and in the northern part of the\r\nScandinavian Peninsula. Here the average of the coldest days of\r\nwinter is 50° below zero.\r\n\r\n=Asia.= It is difficult to determine in what part of Asia the highest\r\ntemperature occurs, as data from many parts are meager. It is known\r\nhowever that extremely hot weather prevails in India and Arabia.\r\nSiberia, however, experiences the coldest weather to be found\r\nanywhere in the world. At Werchojansk, in that country, a temperature\r\nof 90.4° below zero was observed in January, 1884, while the average\r\ntemperature for the whole month was 69.4° below zero.\r\n\r\nThe coldest weather of the world is not found at the North or the\r\nSouth Pole, as many suppose, but rather at the center of vast\r\ncontinents, far from the modifying influence of oceans.\r\n\r\n=Australia.= In extreme heat the interior of Australia is fairly\r\ncomparable with northern Africa, Persia, Afghanistan, and northern\r\nIndia, where every year maximum temperatures of 115° occur, and\r\nwhere, at times, an extreme heat of 120° or 125° is experienced in\r\nthe shade.\r\n\r\nWe now know that the forceful, dominating peoples come out of the\r\nregions where the heat is not so great as to debilitate, nor the cold\r\nso fierce as to deaden the mental and the physical faculties; but\r\nrather from the region of the thoroughfare of the great circum-polar\r\nstorm tracks, where there are frequent changes of weather from\r\nsunshine to clouds, and where there is a fairly wide difference in\r\ntemperature between night and day and between winter and summer. For\r\nthe best coördination of the mental and the physical faculties, so\r\nas to produce the most efficient composite of man, the temperature\r\nshould range between 45° and 50° at night and between 65° and 70°\r\nduring the day, with about sixty-five to seventy per cent. of\r\nrelative humidity. Some day we will artificially create the exact\r\nconditions of temperature and moisture needed for patients in\r\nhospitals and sanitaria. Science is persistently seeking means to\r\nincrease comfort and prolong life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCONDENSATION\r\n\r\n  HOW HAZE, RAIN, SNOW, HAIL, FROST, CLOUD, AND FOG ARE FORMED\r\n\r\n\r\n=Haze= is what might be called diluted cloud or fog; it differs from\r\nthem only in the degree of its density. One may see several miles\r\nthrough a haze, because the minute particles of spheres of water or\r\nice are far apart in comparison to what they are in fog or cloud.\r\n\r\n=Raindrops= vary in size from O.03 to O.20 of an inch in diameter.\r\nEach drop is composed of literally millions of minute specks of water\r\nthat have condensed each about a minute mote of dust. These motes\r\nare a million of times below anything that may be seen with the most\r\npowerful microscope. Recall what is said in Chapter IV about the size\r\nof the molecules in water: if a raindrop were enlarged to the size of\r\nthe earth, the molecules of which it is composed would be no larger\r\nthan a baseball, and the smallest of them no larger than tiny green\r\npeas. Without free surfaces upon which condensation may begin there\r\ncan be no rainfall. Dust motes furnish these surfaces; without them\r\nair may be supersaturated without condensation occurring except where\r\nit comes in contact with solid matter. The little spherical masses\r\nof water join together so as to form raindrops in some manner not\r\nwell understood. When enough of them coalesce so that the weight of\r\nthe drop is too heavy to be supported by the motions of the air it\r\nfalls to the ground, or is evaporated by the warmer and drier lower\r\nair. Raindrops form mainly in the stratum between one and three miles\r\nabove the earth. It is seldom that the stratum of air next the earth\r\nis saturated, even during rainfall. One might evaporate millions\r\nof gallons of water and find no dust as a residue, or at least\r\nnothing visible to the human eye, so infinitesimal are the motes of\r\ncondensation. As high as thirty millions have been shown to exist in\r\na single cubic centimeter of air (Chapter IV), and a million times\r\nthat number could occupy such space without being visible, and the\r\ndust mote is composed of molecules, and the molecules of atoms. It\r\nis impossible for the human mind to grasp the idea of the degree of\r\nsmallness to which the atom attains, and when one tries to conceive\r\nof the electrons from which the atom is built up, he must try to\r\nthink of them not as objects but as the place or condition where\r\nmatter slowly fades away into nothing; as the place possibly where\r\nmatter is transmuted into electrical energy and ceases to exist.\r\n\r\nThe raindrop cannot be formed at great altitudes because the vaporous\r\natmosphere is confined to low levels by temperature. At 100°, which\r\noften exists at the bottom of the atmosphere, air at saturation\r\ncontains 19.77 grains the cubic foot; at 80°, 10.93; at zero, .04;\r\nand at -40°, which always may be found at about four and one half\r\nmiles high, air cannot contain in excess of .01 of a grain. Raindrops\r\nare mainly caused by the cooling of air down to its dew point.\r\n\r\n=Rain Water Is Not Pure.= Hailstones often incase foreign matter that\r\nhas been carried upward by violent winds. Rain water is pure when\r\nit is condensed, but it gathers other matter as it falls, such as\r\nthe pollen of plants, and the broken siliceous shells of microscopic\r\nlife carried by winds of the tropics; it also washes ammonia from the\r\nair in small quantities,—about thirty pounds per acre in the eastern\r\nhalf of the United States each year. A raindrop increases in velocity\r\nas it falls until the resistance of the air becomes just equal to\r\nthe weight of the drop; after that it falls at a uniform rate. It\r\nwill surprise many to learn that if it were not for the retardation\r\neffected by the resistance of the air, a raindrop falling from only\r\nhalf a mile would be as dangerous to life as a rifle bullet, for\r\nthe speed with which a projectile travels can be made sufficient to\r\ncompensate for its softness or yielding qualities.\r\n\r\n=How Much Water Is It Possible to Precipitate from the Earth’s\r\nAtmosphere?= If the entire amount of water vapor present in the\r\natmosphere were precipitated instantly it would furnish a rainfall\r\nof only two inches for the whole surface of the earth. A steady\r\ndownpour for twenty-four hours usually amounts to some two or three\r\ninches. Over small areas and in exceptional cases as many feet have\r\nbeen known to fall in that time, as fresh, vapor-bearing winds\r\nsteadily blew into a storm center, rose, discharged their burdens as\r\nthey cooled with ascent, and then flowed away, again to be charged\r\nwith moisture when they came into contact with wet surfaces. It is\r\nimpossible to drown the entire earth with rainfall, no matter how\r\nlong continued.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—SNOW CRYSTALS.]\r\n\r\n=Snow.= Snow is water vapor condensed in the congealed form, without\r\npassing through the liquid state. When the minute pieces of ice of\r\nwhich the flake is composed are magnified several hundred times they\r\nare found to be composed of the most wonderfully beautiful figures.\r\nThousands have been photographed, but the versatility of nature is\r\nso great that no two ever have been found that were exactly alike.\r\nFigure 31 gives some idea of their infinite variety and perfect\r\nsymmetry. They are always governed by the number six. The most\r\ncommon form at the beginning of winter is a six-rayed star, each ray\r\nbranching. As the winter advances and the cold becomes more severe,\r\nthe flakes take a simpler form, finally becoming slender six-sided\r\nprisms with sharp ends, under the influence of severe cold waves.\r\nGreat pain is inflicted on the exposed parts of the body when these\r\nprisms are encountered in a high wind.\r\n\r\nWhen condensation takes place in a warm stratum it will be in the\r\nform of minute massive spherical particles or spherules. If these\r\nspherules are then whirled aloft by ascending currents it is possible\r\nfor them to be cooled to far below the freezing point without turning\r\nto ice; they will, however, congeal instantly when they touch one\r\nanother or are jostled by touching any solid or liquid surface. They\r\nmay give a coating of ice to the limbs of trees and the coating may\r\nincrease until the limbs break, and the surface of the earth thus\r\nmay be covered with thin ice called _sleet_.\r\n\r\n=Hail.= There is a difference of opinion among meteorologists as\r\nwhether the thunderstorm whirls about a vertical axis, like the\r\ntornado and the hurricane, or whether it rotates about a horizontal\r\naxis. One may well account for the formation of the hailstone by\r\nassuming that its alternating layers of snow and ice are caused by\r\nthe horizontal roll of a thunderstorm, the under part of which has\r\na temperature at or above freezing and the upper half much below\r\nfreezing. A raindrop is formed in the lower part, frozen in its\r\ncourse through the upper part, receives a fresh coating of water\r\nor snow with each revolution and a freezing before its circuit is\r\ncompleted. It thus gains in size until it becomes too heavy to be\r\nsustained by the whirling storm-cloud, when it falls to earth. Hail\r\nusually has the size of small peas, but occasionally it falls in\r\nchunks sufficiently large to kill cattle in the fields. On August 15,\r\n1883, a hailstone weighing eighty pounds is said to have fallen in\r\nKansas.\r\n\r\n=Frost.= Frost is composed of beautiful crystallizations, similar to\r\nsnow. Chapter VII describes the process of formation in detail.\r\n\r\n=Cloud.= Cloud is formed by the cooling by expansion as currents of\r\nair are carried aloft. Clouds are composed of minute watery droplets\r\nor of ice spiculæ, depending on their temperature, and the latter\r\nlargely is determined by elevation. A cloud differs from mist or\r\nrain in the size and number of its particles, and from fog in its\r\nposition and the method of its formation. There are three fundamental\r\nformations, the cirrus, cumulus, and stratus. The others are\r\ncombinations of these. The cirrus are thin, high, veil-like clouds,\r\nalways composed of ice spiculæ; the cumulus look like great banks\r\nof snow with bulging, oval tops in which thunder heads may form;\r\nthe stratus spread out like a great blanket. The cirrus usually fly\r\nat the top of the storm stratum, some five to seven miles high; the\r\nother clouds at some lower level. When rain is falling from a cloud,\r\nit is called nimbus.\r\n\r\n=Fog Is Cloud at a Low Level.= It is formed by warm water vapor\r\nrising from lakes or rivers into the cool night air at the bottom of\r\nvalleys, or by the cold waters of oceans being forced up over a bar,\r\nwhere the coldness that they impart to the adjacent air condenses\r\nsome of its vapor.\r\n\r\n=Artificial Rain Making.= Many swindlers have preyed upon the\r\ncredulity of the public by claiming to have a process for the making\r\nof rain, and in some cases large sums of money have been paid by\r\ncommercial or other associations to these charlatans. In 1892 the\r\nUnited States Congress appropriated $20,000 for the testing of\r\nthe theory that rain could be created by the setting off of large\r\nquantities of explosives. The experiment was unsuccessful, as the\r\nscientists of the Government insisted it would be. The Greeks had a\r\npopular belief that when a host of their soldiers went out to meet\r\nan army of Persians the vapor rising from the hot breath, blood, and\r\nsweat of the struggling mass was later condensed into rain by the\r\nconcussion of the battle clubs and the hoarse cries of the victors,\r\nand many of the veterans of our Civil War were firm in the opinion\r\nthat their great battles were followed by rains that were the result\r\nof the cannonading. Both the Greeks and our American soldiers were\r\nmistaken. Rain often has fallen at the close of great battles, not\r\nbecause of the concussion of the conflict, but because rain falls\r\non an average of one day in three in the regions where most of the\r\ngreat battles have been fought, and the movement of armies began\r\non the fair days when travel was good. If it were the custom to\r\nbegin battles on rainy days we would have the contrary and equally\r\nerroneous theory that concussion clears the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n=Prevention of Hail by the Firing of Guns.= Even a Papal decree was\r\nnot entirely effective in preventing the people in southern Europe\r\nfrom ringing the church bells to prevent the formation of hail when a\r\nstorm threatened, and within the past quarter-century large grants of\r\npublic money were foolishly wasted in the firing by the vineyardists\r\nof France and other parts of Europe of a gun specially designed to\r\ndestroy hail clouds. These guns sent harmless smoke rings a few feet\r\naloft. The writer felt constrained to employ the extensive machinery\r\nof the Weather Bureau to counteract the effect of glowing accounts\r\nof the success of these guns that were sent to this country by some\r\nof the ignorant persons employed by this Government to represent us\r\nas consuls abroad. Even though the hail-destroying guns occasionally\r\nwere choked with hail it was difficult for scientists to prevail upon\r\nthe public to stop their foolish and wasteful practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE AMERICAN WEATHER SERVICE\r\n\r\n  THE LARGEST AND THE MOST EFFECTIVE METEOROLOGICAL BUREAU IN THE\r\n  WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nEven to those who are familiar with the application of meteorological\r\nscience to the making of weather forecasts, and with the material\r\nbenefits accruing to the commerce and industry of the United States\r\nfrom timely warnings of marine storms, frosts, and cold waves, it\r\nwill be interesting to note that at the time of the founding of the\r\nfirst of the thirteen original Colonies, at Jamestown, Virginia, in\r\n1607, practically nothing was known of the properties of the air or\r\nof methods for measuring its forces. To-day electrically recording\r\nautomatic meteorological instruments measure and transcribe for\r\neach moment of time at two hundred stations in the United States,\r\nthe temperature, the air pressure, the velocity of the wind, the\r\ndirection of the wind, the beginning and ending of rainfall,\r\nwith the amount of precipitation; and the presence of sunshine or\r\ncloud; and three thousand voluntary observers each day record the\r\ntemperature and the rainfall.\r\n\r\nThat we live in an age of great intellectual acumen, and that he is\r\nindeed a wise prophet who can even dimly outline the possibilities of\r\nthe next century, is fitly shown by the development of meteorological\r\nscience during the recollection of the present generation; although\r\none must admit that in the making of weather forecasts, valuable as\r\nthey are, we have not advanced beyond the partly empirical stage. It\r\nis, therefore, improbable that in the making of these forecasts we\r\nshall ever attain the accuracy acquired by theoretical astronomy in\r\npredicting the date of an eclipse or the culmination of any celestial\r\nevent.\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1644, twenty-four years after the landing of\r\nthe Pilgrims at Plymouth Rock, that Torricelli discovered the\r\nprinciple of the barometer and rendered it possible to measure the\r\nweight of the superincumbent air at any spot where the wonderful\r\nyet simple little instrument might be placed. Torricelli’s great\r\nteacher—Galileo—died without knowing why nature, under certain\r\nconditions, abhors a vacuum, but he _had_ already discovered the\r\nprinciple of the thermometer. The data from the readings of these\r\ntwo instruments form the base of all meteorological science. Their\r\ninventors as little appreciated the value of their discoveries as\r\nthey dreamed of the coming great western empire which should first\r\nuse their instruments to measure the inception and development of\r\nstorms, and later, with the aid of the electro-magnetic telegraph, to\r\ngive warnings to threatened regions of the approach of hurricanes,\r\ncold waves, floods, and frosts that have been worth at least one\r\nhundred million dollars to this country during the past ten years\r\nwithout counting the many thousands of lives saved among mariners.\r\n\r\nDoctor John Lining, of Charleston, South Carolina, kept a daily\r\nrecord of the temperature in this country as early as 1738, although\r\nthe accurate thermometers of Fahrenheit had then been in use but a\r\nfew years and the errors due to imperfect mechanical construction\r\nmay have been considerable as compared with the refined instruments\r\nnow used for measuring temperature. About one hundred years after\r\nthe invention of the barometer, viz., in 1747, Benjamin Franklin,\r\nthe patriot and statesman, the diplomat, the scientist, divined\r\nthat certain storms may move in a direction opposite to the blowing\r\nof the wind and that they progress in an easterly direction. It\r\nwas prophetic that this idea should come to him long before any\r\none had ever seen charts showing observations simultaneously taken\r\nat many stations. But although his ideas in this respect were more\r\nmomentous than his act of drawing the lightning from the clouds\r\nand identifying it with the electricity of the laboratory, yet his\r\ncontemporaries thought little of his philosophy of storms, and it\r\nwas soon forgotten. It will be interesting to learn how he reached\r\nhis conclusion as to the cyclonic or eddy-like nature of storms.\r\nHe had arranged with a co-worker at Boston to take observations of\r\nan eclipse at the same time that Franklin was taking readings at\r\nPhiladelphia. Early on the evening of the eclipse an unusually severe\r\nnortheast wind and rainstorm set in at Philadelphia and Franklin\r\nwas unable to secure any observations. He reasoned that as the wind\r\nblew fiercely from the northeast the storm, of course, was coming\r\nfrom that direction, and Boston must have experienced its ravages\r\nbefore Philadelphia was reached. Reports indicated that the storm\r\nwas widespread. What was the surprise of Franklin, when, after the\r\nslow passage of the mail by coach, he heard from his friend in\r\nBoston that the night of the eclipse had been clear and favorable\r\nfor observations, but that a terrific northeast wind and rainstorm\r\nbegan early the following morning. Franklin then sent out inquiries\r\nto surrounding stage stations and found that at all places southwest\r\nof Philadelphia the storm began earlier and that the greater the\r\ndistance the earlier the beginning as compared with its advent in\r\nPhiladelphia; but northeast of Philadelphia the time of the beginning\r\nof the storm was later than at the latter city, the storm not\r\nreaching Boston until twelve hours after it began at Philadelphia.\r\nIn considering these facts a line of inductive reasoning brought him\r\nto the conclusion that the wind always blows towards the center of\r\nthe storm; that the northeast storm which Boston and Philadelphia\r\nhad experienced was caused by the suction exercised by an advancing\r\nstorm eddy from the west which drew the air rapidly from Boston\r\ntoward Philadelphia, while the source of the attraction—the center\r\nof the storm eddy—was yet a thousand miles to the southwest of the\r\nlatter place; that the velocity of the northeast wind increased as\r\nthe center of the storm eddy advanced nearer and nearer from the\r\nsouthwest until the wind reached the conditions of a hurricane; that\r\nthe wind between Boston and Philadelphia shifted its direction so as\r\nto come from the southwest after the center of the storm eddy had\r\npassed over this region; and that the force of the wind gradually\r\ndecreased as the center of attraction—which always is the storm\r\ncenter—passed farther and farther away to the northeast.\r\n\r\nAnother man whose name is dear to the heart of every patriotic\r\nAmerican conducted, in conjunction with a friend, a series of weather\r\nobservations, beginning in 1771 and continued during the stirring\r\ntimes of the Revolution. This was the sage of Monticello, Thomas\r\nJefferson.\r\n\r\nDuring the first half of the nineteenth century, nearly a hundred\r\nyears after Franklin’s northeast rainstorm, Redfield, Espy, Loomis,\r\nHenry, and other American scientists laboriously gathered by mail the\r\ndata of storms after their passage and demonstrated their principal\r\nmotions to be such as Franklin had supposed. Professor Joseph Henry,\r\nSecretary of the Smithsonian Institution, in 1855, constructed the\r\nfirst daily weather map from simultaneous observations collected by\r\ntelegraph. He did not publish his forecast but used his large wall\r\nmap for the purpose of demonstrating the feasibility of organizing\r\na Government weather service. If there were no other achievements to\r\nthe credit of the institution founded in this country through the\r\nbenevolence of the English philanthropist, James Smithson, who, by\r\nthe way, never gazed upon our fair land, the work of the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution in connection with practical meteorology would always\r\ngive it a warm place in the hearts of those who believe the crowning\r\nachievements of science consist in giving to the world knowledge\r\nwhich results in the saving of human life, the amelioration of the\r\nsufferings of human beings, and the acceleration of the wheels of\r\ncommerce and industry.\r\n\r\nAlthough American scientists were the pioneers in discovering\r\nthe progressive character of storms and in demonstrating the\r\npracticability of weather services, the United States was the fourth\r\nGovernment to give legal autonomy to a weather service. Holland\r\nestablished a weather service, with telegraph reports and forecasts,\r\nin 1860; England followed with a smaller service in 1861; and\r\nFrance in 1863. But none of these countries has an area from which\r\nobservations can be collected great enough to give such a synoptic\r\npicture of storms as is necessary in the making of forecasts of much\r\nutility. It would require an international service, embracing all\r\nthe countries of Europe, to equal, in extent of the area covered and\r\nof the accuracy of its forecasts, the service of the United States,\r\nwhich was begun in 1870, as the result of agitation by Lapham, Henry,\r\nAbbe, Maury, and others.\r\n\r\nThe vast region now brought under the dominion of twice daily\r\nsynchronous observations embraces an area extending two thousand\r\nmiles north and south, three thousand miles east and west, and so\r\nfortunately located in the interest of the meteorologist as to\r\ninclude an important arc on the circum-polar thoroughfare of storms\r\nof the northern hemisphere. Simultaneous observations, collected\r\ntwice daily by telegraph from two hundred stations, distributed\r\nthroughout this great area, renders it possible at several central\r\noffices, where all the reports are received, to present to the\r\ntrained eye of the forecaster a wonderful panoramic picture of\r\natmospheric conditions. Each twelve hours the kaleidoscope changes\r\nand a new graphic picture of actual changes is shown. The movements\r\nof storm centers and cold-wave areas are noted and estimates made as\r\nto their probable course during the next twenty-four hours. Where\r\nelse can the meteorologist find such an opportunity to study storms\r\nand atmospheric changes?\r\n\r\nIn 1870, and for ten years thereafter, our forecasts and storm\r\nwarnings were looked upon by the press and the people more as\r\nexperiments than as serious statements. The newspapers especially\r\nwere prone to facetiously comment on the forecasts, and many were\r\nclamorous for the abolition of the service during the first years\r\nof its existence. There was some ground for the criticisms. We knew\r\nnearly as much about the mechanics of storms at that time as we do\r\nto-day, but we had not, by a daily watching of the inception, the\r\ndevelopment, and the progression of storms, trained a corps of expert\r\nforecasters, such as now form a part of the staff of the Chief of the\r\nWeather Bureau, and from which the writer was graduated before he\r\nbecame Chief. Along about 1880, mariners began to note that danger\r\nsignals were, in far more than a majority of cases, followed by\r\nheavy winds; they began to reason that it would be better to take\r\nprecaution against storms that never came, than to be unprepared for\r\nthose which did come according to the forecasts.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that many times, by the operation of forces not\r\nindicated by the surface readings, the barometer at the center of\r\na storm begins to rise and the velocity of the whirling mass to\r\ndecrease. In such a case the storm signals placed in advance of\r\nthe storm center would fail to give the proper information. Again,\r\nthe storm center may suddenly acquire a force not anticipated, or\r\nit may pursue a track considerably divergent from the normal for\r\nthe location and season. In this case, also, the forecasts may warn\r\nsome cities that fail to receive the effects of the storm. However,\r\nduring the past few years the staff of the Weather Bureau, which\r\nincludes the ablest meteorologists in the United States, has made a\r\nstudy of the peculiarities of the different types of storms occurring\r\nin the different localities during the various seasons of the year,\r\ntheir line of travel and the force they may be expected to attain.\r\nCompetitive examinations have been held to test the comparative\r\nmerits of those who, by natural ability, are best fitted to correctly\r\nand quickly correlate in their minds the conditions shown on a\r\nmeteorological chart, and to make accurate deductions therefrom as\r\nto the development, movement, and force of storms. This line of work\r\nand investigation has resulted in improved forecasts; so much so that\r\nmariners now universally heed the storm warnings; horticulturists and\r\ntruck gardeners make ample provision for protection against frost;\r\nthe shippers of perishable produce give full credence to the cold\r\nwave predictions. Of the many West Indian hurricanes which have swept\r\nour Atlantic seaboard from Florida to Maine during the past many\r\nyears, not one has reached a single seaport without danger warnings\r\nbeing sent well in advance of the storm; and few unnecessary warnings\r\nhave been issued. The result is that few disasters of consequence\r\nhave occurred. Large owners of marine property estimate that one of\r\nthese severe storms traversing our Atlantic coast in the absence\r\nof danger signals would leave not less than three million dollars’\r\nworth of wreckage. Twice a census was taken just after the passage\r\nof severe hurricanes to determine the value of property held in port\r\nby the danger warning sent out in advance of the storms. In one case\r\nthe figure was placed at thirty-four million dollars and in the other\r\nthirty-eight million dollars. Of course this does not represent the\r\nvalue of property saved. It simply shows the value of property placed\r\nin positions of safety as a result of the danger signals and warning\r\nmessages sent to masters.\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1898, an extensive cold wave swept from the Rocky\r\nMountains eastward to the seaboard. Estimates secured from shippers\r\nin a hundred principal cities indicate that property valued at three\r\nmillion four hundred thousand dollars was saved as a direct result\r\nof the predictions sent out well in advance of the coming of the\r\nsevere cold. The utility of these forecasts to the agriculture, the\r\ncommerce, and the industry of the country is so great that there is\r\nhardly a daily paper that does not publish weather forecasts in a\r\nprominent place, and there is scarcely a reader who fails to note the\r\npredictions.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five years ago mariners on our Great Lakes and seaboard\r\ndepended on their own weather lore to warn them of coming storms.\r\nThen, although the number of craft plying our waters was much less\r\nthan now, every severe storm that swept the Lakes or Atlantic coast\r\nleft destruction and death in its wake, and for days afterward the\r\ndead were cast up by the receding waves, and the shores were lined\r\nwith wreckage. Happily this is not now the case, for the Weather\r\nBureau is ever watching the changes of atmospheric conditions,\r\nand giving to the mariner warning of coming storms. Each observer\r\ntelegraphs instantly to the Central Office whenever the delicately\r\nadjusted instruments at his station show unusual agitation. By this\r\nmeans the inception of many storms is detected when the regular\r\nmorning and evening reports fail to give notice of their origin.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the vast interests floating on the Atlantic coast may\r\nbe had when it is stated that 5628 trans-Atlantic steamers, with an\r\naggregate of 10,076,148 tons, and 5842 sailing craft, aggregating\r\n2,105,688 tons, entered and left ports on the Atlantic seaboard\r\nduring a single year ten years ago, and the record is vastly greater\r\nnow. The value of their cargoes is more than a billion and a half of\r\ndollars. Our coastwise traffic is enormous. Fifteen years ago more\r\nthan seventeen thousand sailing vessels and four thousand steamers\r\nentered and left the ports between Maine and Florida. The number has\r\nlargely increased since. From these facts one can roughly measure the\r\nvalue of the marine property which the Weather Bureau aims to protect\r\nby giving warning of approaching storms.\r\n\r\nIt is the expectation of the meteorologist that some day he will\r\nbe able to accurately forecast the weather for weeks and months in\r\nadvance. What a wonderful conservation of human energy would result\r\nif it were possible to tell the farmer when the great corn and wheat\r\nbelts would have abundant rain during the next growing season, or\r\nwhen droughts would parch and wither the vegetation; or to truthfully\r\ninform the planter of the South that the coming season would be\r\nfavorable or unfavorable for the production of cotton! Effort could\r\nbe withheld in one part of the country, and greater energy exerted in\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThis extension of forecasting doubtless will be accomplished as the\r\nresult of further study of solar impulses which disturb the orderly\r\nprocesses of the earth’s atmosphere and initiate storms, combined\r\nwith a comparative study of meteorological data. We may be laying the\r\nfoundation of a great edifice which shall adorn the civilization of\r\nfuture centuries.\r\n\r\nAs storms of more or less intensity pass over large portions of our\r\ncountry every few days during the greater part of the year, and as it\r\nis seldom that the weather report does not show one or more storms\r\nas operating somewhere within our broad domain, it is easy for some\r\ncharlatan to forecast thunderstorms about a certain time in July, or\r\na cold wave and snow about a certain period in January, and stand\r\na fair chance to accidentally become famous as a prophet. One may\r\nselect any three equidistant dates in January and forecast high wind,\r\nsnow, and cold for New York City, and stand a fair chance of having\r\nthe fraudulent forecast verified in two out of the three cases,\r\nprovided that you claim a storm coming the day before or the day\r\nafter one of your dates is the storm that you expected.\r\n\r\nFrom the introduction of the electro-magnetic telegraph in 1844 down\r\nto 1869 intermittent advocations were made by many in this country\r\nfor a national weather service. Finally Doctor Increase A. Lapham, of\r\nMilwaukee, scientist and philanthropist, so aroused the property and\r\nfinancial interests of the country with the facts that he presented\r\nrelative to the destruction of life and property by storms on Lake\r\nMichigan that Congress, under provisions of a bill introduced by\r\nGeneral Halbert E. Paine, was induced to appropriate money to\r\ninitiate a service. To General Albert J. Meyer, Chief Signal Officer,\r\nU. S. A., was intrusted the duty of inaugurating a tentative weather\r\nservice by deploying over the country as observers the military\r\nsignalmen of his command. From this beginning has evolved the present\r\nextensive Weather Bureau, which is the largest in the world and more\r\nintimately serves the needs of the public than any other.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 Professor Cleveland Abbe published a weather bulletin at\r\nCincinnati, based upon simultaneous observations secured by telegraph\r\nfrom about thirty stations. He was the first scientific assistant\r\nto General Meyer and remained continuously with the service until\r\nhis death in 1919. Colonel (afterward Brigadier-General) H. H.\r\nC. Dunwoody, U. S. A., served twenty-seven years as an expert\r\nforecaster or as the assistant chief of the Weather Bureau. General\r\nA. W. Greely, of Arctic fame, the last of the military chiefs,\r\nsucceeded Brigadier-General William B. Hazen on the death of the\r\nlatter. Professor Mark W. Harrington was the first chief of the new\r\ncivil Weather Bureau; he served but four years and was succeeded\r\nby Professor Willis L. Moore, who remained chief for eighteen\r\nyears, serving two years under President Cleveland, who appointed\r\nhim, and during the entire administrations of McKinley, Roosevelt,\r\nand Taft, and was removed by Woodrow Wilson immediately on taking\r\noffice. Professor Moore claims the honor of having been the first\r\npresidential appointee to incur the displeasure and receive the\r\npublic condemnation of Woodrow Wilson. The present chief is Professor\r\nCharles F. Marvin, who for many years served as an assistant to\r\nProfessor Moore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abbe, Cleveland, 298;\r\n    publishes weather bulletin, 305;\r\n    his long service in the Weather Bureau, 305\r\n\r\n  Absolute humidity, 39\r\n\r\n  Absolute zero, 62\r\n\r\n  Aërial ocean, the air a great, 7\r\n\r\n  Aëroplane, importance of developing the, 27\r\n\r\n  Africa, and monsoon winds, 107;\r\n    hottest and coldest places in, 279\r\n\r\n  Agricultural interests, benefit of Weather Bureau service to, 301, 302\r\n\r\n  Air, great ocean of, around the earth, 7;\r\n    condition of, at various levels, 7-17;\r\n    liquid, 9;\r\n    blue tint of, 10;\r\n    thinness of stratum of, that sustains life, 14;\r\n    elasticity and density of, 14;\r\n    pressure of, 15;\r\n    weight of, 15;\r\n    everything evolved from, 15-17;\r\n    effect of cold wave on the, 36, 37;\r\n    explorations of the, 18-28;\r\n    circulation of the, 55;\r\n    increasing pressure increases temperature of, 61;\r\n    difference between weight and pressure of, 77;\r\n    course of a current of, 99;\r\n    earth warmer than, next above, 180;\r\n    cools with ascent and heats with descent, 184;\r\n    height of freezing cold in free, 185;\r\n    daily range of temperature in free, 185, 186;\r\n    movement of, in valleys, 204;\r\n    mountains and movement of, 205;\r\n    proper temperature and humidity of, in habitations, 217;\r\n    water vapor in, at various temperatures, 284;\r\n    retards falling raindrops, 285;\r\n    and the formation of cloud, 287, 288\r\n\r\n  Air travel, Major Blair on, 27;\r\n    Lieut.
